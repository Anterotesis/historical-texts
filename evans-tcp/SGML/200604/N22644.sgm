<HEAD>INTRODUCTORY PREFACE To CHRISTIAN READERS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a real fact, evident beyond contradiction, that every individual &s;hould acquire a thorough knowledge of the Life and Death of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST, who was crucified for our &s;ins, ro&s;e again for our ju&s;tification, and now &s;itteth at the right hand of GOD, making interce&s;&s;ion for us. If Chri&s;tians &s;eek a noble example of conduct to copy after we would recommend to them the glorious and benevolent tran&s;actions OF THE GREAT CAPTAIN OF OUR SALVATION;
One, who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet made him&s;elf of no reputation, &s;uffering his divine e&s;&s;ence to be clothed with mortality, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cro&s;s; that mankind by the merits of his redemption, through faith, might enjoy everla&s;ting happine&s;s throughout eternity in the realms above. The Life and Death of our Holy <HI>REDEEMER,</HI> with other matters herein contained, is a Work, if properly executed, of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to this Chri&s;tian land, and is the mo&s;t valuable of all hi&s;tories; but it is a circum&s;tance which will be readily allowed, by the impartial and di&s;intere&s;ted, and which has been long much lamented by many, that no complete and perfectly authentic Work of this kind has yet been pub|li&s;hed, whereby per&s;ons of every capacity may gain a thorough knowledge of the important &s;ubject. Hitherto, works of this &s;ort have been publi&s;hed in too &s;mall a compa&s;s, and likewi&s;e in too &s;mall &s;izes, which are by no means &s;o elegant, &s;o convenient, or &s;o well adapted to the importance of &s;o valuable a work, which &s;hould not be cut &s;hort and man|gled to &s;uit any private purpo&s;e whatever. Some of the&s;e publications have been com|piled by per&s;ons who&s;e names, characters, and private &s;entiments, would have done no honor to a work of the kind, and were therefore u&s;hered into the world under the names of fictitious per&s;ons who never exi&s;ted; and others of them have been &s;o wretchedly executed, that Chri&s;tian people have only parted with their money, without having their expectations at all an&s;wered. To remedy all the&s;e defects, by which the PUBLIC have been long materially injured, I was applied to by my numerous friends to publi&s;h this NEW AND COMPLETE LIFE OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST, the diligent labour of many years, and which, by the ble&s;&s;ings of God, I have now committed to the pre&s;s, in order that it may be of real benefit and u&s;e to pious and &s;incere Chri&s;tians of
<PB N="IV" REF="029927_0004_0FE335419B9BA850">
every denomination. I have been particularly urged to treat this important &s;ubject at <HI>Large</HI> in the mo&s;t copious and &s;atisfactory manner, and to cau&s;e it to be beautifully printed in FOLIO, on an excellent <HI>large new Letter,</HI> which I am per&s;uaded is the mo&s;t elegant and be&s;t &s;ize for the purpo&s;e, and what will, I doubt not, be approved of by an indulgent Public, in preference to any other form. It is calculated to convey <HI>divine knowledge</HI> to <HI>all ranks</HI> of <HI>people,</HI> rectify <HI>errors</HI> which too many are apt to run into, repre&s;ent <HI>real religion</HI> in its <HI>native colours,</HI> as taught by CHRIST him&s;elf, and enable even the mo&s;t ignorant <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> to give an account of the <HI>faith</HI> that is in him, when called upon on any occa&s;ion. The &s;acred writings of the Evangeli&s;ts, &amp;c. have not only been carefully con&s;ulted, and the re&s;pective accounts &s;y&s;tematically arranged, &s;o as to make this work a complete <HI>Har|mony</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pels,</HI> but prophane <HI>authors</HI> of undoubted <HI>authority,</HI> who were co-temporaries with the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> have furni&s;hed us with a variety of u&s;eful particulars relating to our Ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR, not included in the Scripture Hi&s;tory. The evidence which Jo&s;ephus bears to different parts of our REDEEMER'S LIFE, has al&s;o been faithfully pre&s;erved, together with an account of the <HI>Jewi&s;h cu&s;toms, offices,</HI> and <HI>&s;ects;</HI> every other writer (ancient and modern) on the &s;ubject, has al&s;o been diligently peru&s;ed; and no trouble or expence &s;pared to render this work, in every re&s;pect, the mo&s;t complete and perfect of the kind: being happily calculated to convey to the inqui&s;itive mind a <HI>perfect knowledge</HI> of our <HI>holy religion,</HI> to promote <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in the <HI>merits</HI> of our Ble&s;&s;ed REDEEMER, and to recommend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>practice</HI> of every <HI>Chri&s;tian virtue.</HI> The <HI>Chronological</HI> and <HI>Geographical parts</HI> are likewi&s;e minutely attended to, and the errors which others have fallen into, are mo&s;t carefully avoided. In this Preface, I &s;hall only mention a few things more; and may they be attentively con&s;idered by all per&s;ons of both &s;exes, old and young. Let it be your care to make the evidences of Chri&s;tianity the &s;ubject of your &s;erious reflection and conver&s;e, wherein &s;uch marks of truth and divinity are to be found. The &s;ubject of the Life of our Ble&s;&s;ed REDEEMER, is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to every one, and demands our mo&s;t &s;erious regard; for, as the great Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Chri&s;t hath &s;uffered for us, leaving an example to us, that we might follow his &s;teps:</HI> He declares him&s;elf the <HI>Way,</HI> the <HI>Truth,</HI> and the <HI>Life:</HI> He not only <HI>redeem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> our <HI>&s;ouls</HI> from <HI>death</HI> to <HI>life,</HI> but <HI>enlightens</HI> and <HI>leads</HI> all his faithful <HI>followers</HI> in the <HI>paths</HI> of <HI>&s;afety,</HI> to a happy <HI>eternity.</HI> The an&s;wers which I have given to Athei&s;ts, Dei&s;ts, and Infidelity in general, I hope will be found of the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory nature to my numerous readers, and &s;uch as will build them up in their mo&s;t holy faith. The examples of the holy Apo&s;tles, Evangeli&s;ts, Di&s;ciples, and other eminent per&s;ons and primitive Chri&s;tians (al&s;o given in this work) will likewi&s;e afford great in&s;truc|tion to every reader; and the practical improvements and doctrinal remarks, inter&s;per&s;ed throughout the whole, will be carefully applied to the faith and duty of every Believer.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Concerning the State of Religion, &amp;c. in the World in General, and in the Roman Empire and the Jewi&s;h Nation in particular, at the Time of our REDEEMER's Birth. Including an Account of the various Sects amongst the Jews, and other particulars, by way of Introduction.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is generally acknowledged, by the mo&s;t learned and judicious chronologers, that the GREAT REDEEMER was born in the four thou&s;andth year after the creation of the world, and four years before the vulgar aera. This mi&s;take is &s;uppo&s;ed to have ari&s;en from the low &s;tate of learning, when the birth of CHRIST was fir&s;t fixed as the epocha from which the whole Chri&s;tian world reckoned their time. This being upwards of five hundred years after the birth of CHRIST, and there being no authentic records, to fix the the time with exactne&s;s and preci&s;ion, a mi&s;take of four years was at fir&s;t made, and hath been ever &s;ince continued. The year in which the SAVIOUR of the world was born, was the thirty-third of Herod, king of the Jews, after his taking Jeru&s;alem; and the twenty-&s;ixth of the emperor Augu&s;tus, after the victory of Actium; which, concluding the conte&s;t between him and Mark Anthony, put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole Roman empire. It was now about &s;even hundred and fifty years &s;ince the building of Rome. The Romans had carried their victorious arms through the &s;urrounding nations, and by their ju&s;tice, clemency, and moderation, ri&s;en to the highe&s;t pitch of glory and renown: but by the pride, luxury, and frequent quarrels of their great men, the empire was &s;inking from its ancient greatne&s;s; the commonwealth was at an end; and the &s;enate had been forced to &s;ubmit to a ma&s;ter. Though the &s;tate had made a violent &s;truggle for liberty, in the murder of Julius Cae&s;ar, great quarrel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ucceeded, and the whole empire was &s;ubjected to
<PB N="6" REF="029927_0006_0FE33546AFD456C8">
authority of Augu&s;tus. This was a prince of a very amiable di&s;po&s;ition: he, by his wi&s;e management, put an end to all contention, and governed the empire with &s;uch ju&s;tice, prudence, and moderation, as made him highly e&s;teemed by his &s;ubjects. He not only &s;ettled the affairs of the &s;tate &s;o as to pre&s;erve all things quiet at home, but had the like &s;ucce&s;s throughout the remoter parts of the va&s;t empire: for a general peace prevailed through all the world, when our Great Redeemer, the heavenly Prince of peace, was born.</P>
<P>THE Jewi&s;h nation was, at this time, groaning under the tyranny of Herod the Great; who, though an old man, declining in his health, and ju&s;t bordering on the grave, had &s;o little thought of his latter end, that he reigned with &s;uch cruelty and tyranny, as ju&s;tly rendered him the abhorrence of his &s;ubjects. A late writer has a&s;&s;erted, that the Jews were, at this time, grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed by the Roman power, but as Herod was, for the mo&s;t part, in favour with the emperor Augu&s;tus, and had liberty from him to rule as he plea&s;ed, and even, on &s;light grounds of complaint, to put his own &s;ons, Alexander and Chri&s;tobolus to death; it mu&s;t certainly be the oppre&s;&s;ion of Herod, and not of Augu&s;tus (who was a prince of a contrary character) whom the Jews groaned under. Herod was a prince of Idumean decent, who&s;e ance&s;tors had been pro&s;elytes to the Jewi&s;h religion. He had no right to the regal authority, but was impo&s;ed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Jews by the Roman power, when there was a conte&s;t between Hyrcanus and Ari&s;tobolus, two brothers of the A&s;monian family, for the royal dignity. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> took the advantage of this, and Herod was declared king of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;enate, and three years after, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Roman arms i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the taking Jeru&s;alem: and from that time he reigned over the Jewi&s;h nation, in &s;ubjection to the Romans, about thirty-five years. Herod was a prince of a martial di&s;po&s;ition, but as he knew he had no legal right to the crown, he was guilty of the highe&s;t inju&s;tice and cruelty to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that dignity which he had by unlawful means obtained; and never was at re&s;t till he had procured the death of every prince who was related to it. Having thus erected his throne on murder, treachery, and all kinds of wickedne&s;s, his reign was &s;uch as might be expected from &s;uch a beginning. For though he ro&s;e to great opulence and power; though he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all that his ambition a&s;pired to; yet he was con&s;tantly di&s;turbed by dome&s;tic divi&s;ions, and troubles of various kinds, which rendered him mo&s;t deplorably unhappy in the mid&s;t of pro&s;perity. Though he was &s;ucce&s;sful in his wars, and con&s;tantly augmenting his dominions; though in the &s;umptuous buildings he erected, and in his grandeur and magnificence, in all re&s;pects, he exceeded his predece&s;&s;ors, Solomon only excepted; yet his reign was one &s;eries of plots, jealou&s;ies, cruelties, murder, and every thing that is &s;hocking to human nature.</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of religion in the world, at the time of our Redeemer's birth, was &s;uch as &s;tood in the greate&s;t need of a teacher &s;ent from God. The various nations around the globe were immer&s;ed in the darkne&s;s of idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition. And though the unity of God, and the immortality of the &s;oul had been taught by Socrates and Plato, yet their &s;entiments were dark and confu&s;ed, very little known among&s;t the vulgar, and very little depended on among&s;t the more learned. The Jews only retained the wor&s;hip of the true God. Their temple-wor&s;hip was the &s;ame as e&s;tabli&s;hed by Solomon; and the law and the prophets were weekly read in their &s;ynagogues; but they had, in a great mea&s;ure, made the moral law void by their traditions, and their temple-wor&s;hip was much declined from the primitive glory of its in&s;titution. The &s;econd temple had now &s;tood upwards of four hundred years. It was va&s;tly inferior, in magnificence and grandeur, to that which was built by Solomon. It wanted the ark of the covenant, the Divine Pre&s;ence, the Urim and Thummim, the holy fire upon the altar, and the &s;pirit of prophecy. It was fir&s;t profaned and plundered by Antiochus Epiphanus. It had lately been di&s;honoured by the impious
<PB N="7" REF="029927_0007_0FE3354833687238">
boldne&s;s of Pompey; and &s;oon after by Cra&s;&s;us, another Roman general, who rapaciou&s;ly &s;eized tho&s;e va&s;t trea&s;ures which Pompey's piety and mode&s;ty had &s;pared. In a few years after came Herod, who having obtained the grant of the kingdom at Rome, be&s;ieged and took the city and temple. And though, in order to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the affections of the people, he did all in his power to pre&s;erve the temple from being plundered, and a few years after expended va&s;t &s;ums in repairing and beautifying it, yet, as he obtained the regal dignity by the favour of the Romans, he was always careful to plea&s;e and oblige them; and accordingly profaned the temple with a golden eagle, which was fixed upon the great porch at the entrance of that fabric, in order to court the favour of the emperor Augu&s;tus. This gave great offence to the Jews, who were &s;crupulou&s;ly exact in the ob&s;ervance of the minute&s;t rituals, but &s;candalou&s;ly carele&s;s in the weightier matters of the law: and while, on every trifling occa&s;ion, they were ready to cry out, <HI>The Temple of the Lord! The Temple of the Lord!</HI> they had &s;o little regard to the divinity which dwelt within, that they made this holy place a market for trade and merchandize; and filled the &s;acred apartments with dealers, merchants, money-changers, and u&s;urers. And &s;uch were the inju&s;tice and extortion they practi&s;ed in the holy place, it was ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that the hou&s;e which God had appointed for an hou&s;e of prayer, they had converted into a den of thieves.</P>
<P>HOWEVER little religion there was among&s;t the Jews, they were very forward and open in their profe&s;&s;ion, and there were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al parties among&s;t them who violently oppo&s;ed each other. Tho&s;e who are mentioned in the go&s;pels are the Phari&s;ees, the Sadducees, the Herodians and the Samaritans; of each of the&s;e it may be proper to give &s;ome account. The <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> were the greate&s;t of all the Jewi&s;h &s;ects; and by their pretences to extra|ordinary purity, and the &s;hew they made in things external, they drew the bulk of the common people after them. They maintained a kind of prie&s;tly pride, and &s;olemn &s;tiffne&s;s in their deportment, doing every thing in their power to attract the notice, and gain the veneration of the multitude. A trumpet was founded before them when they gave alms to the poor; they made long prayers at the corners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f &s;teets, and in the markets, taking every occa&s;ion to exhibit the utmo&s;t o&s;tentation of pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty and devotion.</P>
<P>BUT the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of the Phari&s;ees, was their zeal for the traditions of the elders, which they con&s;tantly maintained, were of equal authority with the written law, as they were received from God him&s;elf by Mo&s;es when he was forty days on the mount. The&s;e traditions were multiplied to &s;uch an enormous number, that they were &s;ufficient to fill twelve folio volumes: and the&s;e men pretending to an exact and rigorous ob&s;ervance of the law according to the&s;e traditions, would fain have them&s;elves looked upon more holy than others, and therefore &s;eparated them&s;elves from tho&s;e whom they e&s;teemed great &s;inners and profane per&s;ons, and refu&s;ed to eat or drink with them. They looked with contempt on the common people, and the con&s;tant language of their looks and behaviour was, Stand by! Come not near me! I am holier than thou! They were &s;crupulou&s;ly exact in the performance of the minute&s;t rituals, and prided them&s;elves in their punctuality in paying tithes of herbs, while they neglected the weightier matters of the law. They pre&s;umed &s;o far as proudly to mention their good deeds in their prayers, and propo&s;ed them as the grounds of the divine acceptance; though, at the &s;ame time, while they maintained the fair outward &s;hew of piety and goodne&s;s, they were privately guilty of great and &s;candalous vices. This &s;ect of the Phari&s;ees, in proce&s;s of time, &s;wallowed up all the other &s;ects among&s;t the Jews; and, at pre&s;ent, it is by the traditions of the Phari&s;ees, and not by the law and the prophets, that the Jewi&s;h religion is formed.</P>
<P>JOINED with the Phari&s;ees in the go&s;pels, are the Scribes and the Lawyers, who were not di&s;tinct &s;ects or parties among&s;t the Jews, but men profe&s;&s;ing learning, and chiefly

followers of the Phari&s;ees in their religion; for the learning of the Jews principally con&s;i&s;ting in the knowledge of the Phari&s;aical traditions, and the interpretation of the &s;criptures by them, it is no wonder that the twelve folio volumes, above mentioned, found employ|ment for great numbers of the&s;e men.</P>
<P>ANOTHER noted &s;ect among&s;t the Jews, at the time of our great Redeemer's birth, was the <HI>Sadduc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es:</HI> The&s;e, at their fir&s;t &s;eparation, differed only from the Phari&s;ees in their refu&s;ing to receive the tradition of the elders, and abiding by the written law; but in proce&s;s of time, they degenerated into an univer&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m; and like our modern Dei&s;ts, they neither believed there exi&s;ted good or evil &s;pirits, or that there would be a re&s;urrection, or a future &s;tate. As to the <HI>Herodians,</HI> it is not &s;o preci&s;ely known what their di&s;tin|gui&s;hing tenets were; but as their doctrine is called in the go&s;pel, <HI>The leaven of Herod,</HI> and as their party takes its name from that prince, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed their particular opinions were derived from him: now as, from his general character and conduct, we may conclude that the doctrine of the Sadducees would be very agreeable to him, as it delivered him from the fears of an hereafter, and as it is well known that as &s;oon as he was &s;ecurely &s;ettled on his throne (having cut off all the heirs of the A&s;monian family) he began to introduce Pagan cu&s;toms among&s;t the Jews; It is very likely that the Herodians held nearly the &s;ame &s;entiments as the Sadducees, and that they approved the conduct of Herod, in the introduction of the Heathen &s;uper&s;titions.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary, la&s;tly, to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> account of the <HI>Samaritans:</HI> The&s;e people were not of Jewi&s;h extraction, but were the offspring of tho&s;e Heathen nations whom the king of A&s;&s;yria &s;ent to dwell in the land of I&s;rael, in the room of the ten tribes who were carried away captive. Tho&s;e people when fir&s;t planted in the land, were grievou&s;ly annoyed by lions; and &s;uppo&s;ing that this misfortune aro&s;e from their being ignorant of the wor&s;hip of the god of the land (for the Heathens &s;uppo&s;ed that every land had its peculiar deity) they applied to E&s;arhaddon, the grand&s;on of the king who carried them captive, and he &s;ent them an I&s;raeliti&s;h prie&s;t, who taught them the wor&s;hip of God according to the law of Mo&s;es. They now took the God of I&s;rael into the number of their deities, and wor&s;hipped him in conjunction with the gods of the nations from whence they came. Hence, when the Jews returned from the Babyloni&s;h captivity, and, by the permi&s;&s;ion and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Cyrus king of Per&s;ia, were building their temple, the Samaritans, as they in part profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame religion, propo&s;ed an alliance with them, and offered their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in carrying on the work. This the Jews abruptly refu&s;ed, which gave &s;uch offence to the Samaritans, that they took all po&s;&s;ible pains to ob&s;truct them in the undertaking; and, by corrupting the officers of Cyrus, prevailed &s;o far, that the work was interrupted for a con&s;iderable time. After &s;ome years, the Jews obtained a fre&s;h decree from Darius, the third Per&s;ian king from Cyrus, and the temple was fini&s;hed and dedicated. But the city of Jeru&s;alem lay in a ruinous condition, and the Jews remained under great contempt and various di&s;couragements, for about &s;ixty years. At the end of this time, Divine Providence appeared for them, and rai&s;ed them up a friend in the per&s;on of Artaxerxes Longimanus, the Aha&s;uerus of the Scriptures. This prince, having exalted a Jewi&s;h young lady, named E&s;ther, to be his queen, was a con&s;tant favourer of the Jews; and &s;ent Ezra, a prie&s;t of great learning and piety, from the Per&s;ian court, to reform the abu&s;es, and &s;ettle the di&s;orders that had ari&s;en among&s;t them. And, in a few years afterwards, by the intere&s;t of the queen, he &s;ent his cup-bearer, Nehemiah, to rebuild the walls of Jeru&s;alem, and continue and perfect the reformation which Ezra had begun. In the carrying on of this work, the Jews met with great oppo&s;ition from the Samaritans; and hence there aro&s;e a mortal hatred between the two people. The Samaritans, in the conte&s;t, were chiefly &s;upported by Sanba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at, the governor of Samaria;
<PB N="9" REF="029927_0009_0FE33555A0BADC48">
who having married his daughter to Mana&s;&s;eh, the &s;on of the Jewi&s;h high-prie&s;t, pre|vailed &s;o far on Darius Nothus, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Artaxerxes that he obtained from him a grant to build a temple on mount Gerizim, near Samaria; and to make his &s;on-in-law high-prie&s;t thereof. This was accordingly effected, and introduced a change in the Samaritan religion: for whereas they had, till now, only wor&s;hipped the God of I&s;rael, in conjunction with their deities, they now conformed them&s;elves to the wor&s;hip of the true God only, according to the law of Mo&s;es, which was daily read in their new temple: from this time, the cities of Samaria became places of refuge for tho&s;e Jews who had been guilty of &s;uch crimes as expo&s;ed them to puni&s;hment, and thither they fled to e&s;cape the arm of ju&s;tice. Hence, in proce&s;s of time, aro&s;e a mongrel people, betwixt the Jews and Samaritans. The quarrel between them and the regular Jews continued, and their hatred to each other remained at its highe&s;t pitch. And though John Hyrcanus, the &s;on of Simon Maccabeus, de&s;troyed their temple, yet they continued a &s;eparate wor&s;hip from the Jews. They acknowledged the authority of no other Scripture than the five books of Mo&s;es, which they kept in a character peculiar to them&s;elves, &s;aid to be the old Hebrew character, which was in u&s;e among&s;t the Jews before the Babyloni&s;h captivity. Though they were remarkable for their &s;trictne&s;s in the ob&s;ervance of the rules of the law, yet they were more dete&s;table to the Jews than were the Heathen nations. When Jeru&s;alem was de&s;troyed by the Romans, about &s;eventy years after the birth of CHRIST, when the temple was burnt, and the whole nation di&s;per&s;ed, the Samaritans remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their country, and there they continue to this day.</P>
<P>SUCH was the &s;tate of religion among&s;t the Jews at the time of the birth of CHRIST; nor were their morals in any re&s;pect &s;uperior. Their religion chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in externals, and by their traditions, they explained away mo&s;t of the excellent precepts of the moral law. Their great men were privately guilty of the mo&s;t &s;candalous vices; nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the common people were more regular in their conduct, or that they &s;hould e&s;cape the general corruption which univer&s;ally prevailed in the land.</P>

<P>Of the Promi&s;es and Predictions, in the various ages of the World, relating to the Dignity, Character, Office and Birth, of our Great and Glorious REDEEMER.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE great King of the univer&s;e, having in his eternal coun&s;els, determined to &s;end his only Son, at an appointed period of time, to accompli&s;h the &s;alvation of lo&s;t, undone &s;inners; he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, in the various ages o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the world, to give &s;uch intimations of this great event, as were con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of his moral govern|ment, and the de&s;igns of his grace: and that his offending creatures might not group in darkne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, without any hope of his mercy, or knowledge of the way in which he would accept his rebellious &s;ubjects, and re&s;tore them to his favour, he was plea&s;ed, as &s;oon as &s;in had entered into the world, to give our fir&s;t parents &s;ome hope of their re&s;toration; and in pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence on the &s;erpent who had &s;educed them, he declared that the &s;eed of the woman &s;hould brui&s;e his head; which, though it could not give them a clear idea of the nature of their deliverance, nor of the glorious per&s;on who &s;hould accompli&s;h it, yet it might be &s;ufficient to quiet their minds, and in&s;pire them with a di&s;tant hope. What further di&s;coveries of the divine will, in the redemption of &s;inners by the Son of God, were made to the antediluvian patriarchs, are not clearly revealed
<PB N="10" REF="029927_0010_0FE335574A474D48">
in the word of God; but from the prophecy of Enoch, recorded by the apo&s;tle Jude, it may be concluded, that the world was not ignorant of this great event; for the patri|arch, who could &s;o clearly declare, <HI>Behold the Lord cometh with ten thou&s;and of his &s;aints to execute judgment on all</HI> mankind, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be totally ignorant of the great per&s;on who was to &s;it in judgment: and the hard &s;peeches which he charges ungodly &s;inners with &s;peaking again&s;t God, may have no indirect reference to the &s;corn, contempt, and reproach, which our great redeemer &s;uffered from the ungodly and unbelieving Jews. What further di&s;coveries of the Redeemer were made to the patriarch Noah, and his de|&s;cendants, after the flood, are not to be learned from the volume of in&s;piration; but there we learn, that Abraham was called from his idolatrous countrymen, by a divine manife&s;ta|tion, learnt the uncorrupted wor&s;hip of the true God, and informed that in his &s;eed all the nations of the world &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed. That this patriarch had full expectation of &s;ome exalted per&s;on, who was to ri&s;e out of his family, and that the notion of this prevailed among&s;t his de&s;cendants, are evident from the ble&s;&s;ing which Jacob, at his death, pro|nounces on his &s;on Judah, Gen. xlix.10. <HI>The &s;ceptre &s;hall not depart from Judah, nor a law-giver from between his feet, till Shiloh come, and unto him &s;hall the gathering of the people be.</HI> The &s;ceptre not departing from Judah, is here a prediction; but the coming of <HI>Shiloh</HI> at an appointed time, is mentioned as a thing already known. There is no mention directly made of our exalted Saviour, among&s;t the moral precepts of the law; but it is univer&s;ally allowed, that the various rituals of the Jewi&s;h religion were typical of his exalted per&s;on, his offices, and the great atonement he made to divine ju&s;tice, when he made his &s;oul an offering for &s;in&punc; and Mo&s;es could declare to I&s;rael in plain terms, <HI>A prophet &s;hall the Lord thy God rai&s;e unto thee from among&s;t thy brethren like unto me, and it &s;hall come to pa&s;s that whom&s;oever &s;hall not hear that prophet, he &s;hall be cut off from among&s;t his people.</HI> During the conque&s;t of Canaan, the anarchy and confu&s;ion which &s;ucceeded in the time of the Judges, and the reign of Saul, we hear nothing of the Me&s;&s;iah. But the royal prophet David, in his p&s;alms, gives a very lively and &s;pirited account of a full belief in this great de&s;cendant of his; and in a language peculiar to him&s;elf, de&s;cribes the glories of his reign, his death, and triumphant re&s;urrection: for having a clear and full view of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom and reign, he, in poetic rapture, could cry out, <HI>Thou will not leave my &s;oul in hell, neither wilt thou &s;uffer thine Holy One to &s;ee corruption.</HI> But clearer, and &s;tronger &s;till, our great Redeemer blazes forth in the prophecies of I&s;aiah, who writes more like an hi&s;torian than a prophet, and minutely particularizes the great events which attended the birth, life, and death of the Saviour of &s;inners. Full of prophetic fire, the great I&s;aiah could cry out, <HI>A virgin &s;hall conceive and bear a &s;on, and call his name Immanuel.</HI> And having a clear view of his &s;ufferings and death, he could add, <HI>He was led like a &s;heep to the &s;laughter; and as a lamb before her &s;hearers is dumb; &s;o he opened not his mouth. He was taken from pri&s;on and judgment; who &s;hall declare his generation? For the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of my people was he &s;mitten. He made his grave with the wicked, and the rich, in his death. But he was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, he was brui&s;ed for our iniquities, the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was upon him, and by his &s;tripes we are healed.</HI> The &s;ucceeding prophets were very clear and expre&s;s in their de&s;criptions of the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah. The prophet Jeremiah particularly mentions the thirty pieces of &s;ilver, for which he was &s;old; and the prophet Daniel pointed out the particular time when he &s;hould make his appearance in the world. <HI>Seventy weeks,</HI> &s;ays the angel, <HI>are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city; to fini&s;h the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, to make an end of &s;in, to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s; to &s;eal up the vi&s;ion and prophecy, and to anoint the Mo&s;t Holy.</HI> From the&s;e plain and frequent declarations of their prophets, the Jews had a full and clear expectation of the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah; and they had an old tradition among&s;t them, which was generally received, and &s;uppo&s;ed to come from Elias, that the
<PB N="11" REF="029927_0011_0FE33558D00B25B0">
Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould appear in the four thou&s;andth year of the world, which accordingly came to pa&s;s. Nor was the expectation of our Redeemer's birth confined only to the Jews; a tradition prevailed among&s;t the Ea&s;tern nations, that a great king was to be born to the Jews, who would be worthy to be wor&s;hipped: which is manife&s;t from the wi&s;e men coming to Jeru&s;alem, to enquire after this glorious per&s;on, having &s;een his &s;tar in the Ea&s;t, and being de&s;irous not only to &s;ee the young king, but to pre&s;ent their offerings before him. Nor mu&s;t it be omitted, that among&s;t the oracles of the <HI>Sibyls,</HI> at the time of our Saviour's birth, in &s;uch high repute at Rome, are various predictions of the times of the Me&s;&s;iah; and the poet Virgil, who wrote in the beginning of Augu&s;tus, compo&s;ed his <HI>Pollio,</HI> which contains the predictions of a heavenly child &s;oon to be born, whom he calls the Son of God, and de&s;cribes his kingdom in a manner which is parallel to &s;everal &s;ublime pa&s;&s;ages in the prophet I&s;aiah, de&s;criptive of the glorious Redeemer of mankind.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE happy time being near at hand, fixed by the Triune God, for our great Redeemer to make his appearance in the world, called in Scripture, <HI>The fullne&s;s of time,</HI> it plea&s;ed the Eternal King of heaven and earth, to give notice to mankind, that this exalted per&s;on would &s;oon be manife&s;ted, and the benefits ari&s;ing from his mi&s;&s;ion obtained. God had declared by his prophets, that before his Son appeared in the world, <HI>A me&s;&s;enger &s;hould go before his face, to prepare his way.</HI> This me&s;&s;enger was further de&s;cribed under the character of the prophet Elijah; and in another place he was called <HI>The voice of one crying in the wilderne&s;s, prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make &s;traight, in the de&s;ert, a high way for our God.</HI> In the accompli&s;hment of tho&s;e prophecies, it was nece&s;&s;ary that John the Bapti&s;t, the forerunner of our great Redeemer, &s;hould fir&s;t be born; and, accordingly, the Angel Gabriel was &s;ent from heaven to give notice of the birth of this great herald of the Lord of life. The per&s;ons de&s;tined to be parents to this extra|ordinary man, were Zacharias, a pious prie&s;t, and his wife Elizabeth; who were both of the family of Aaron, and blamele&s;s in the ob&s;ervance of the law. But, though they had lived from their youth in the married &s;tate, they were not ble&s;&s;ed with any offspring, and were both &s;o far advanced in years, that according to the cour&s;e of nature, no i&s;&s;ue could be expected from them. The prie&s;ts that officiated in the temple of Solomon, were divided into twenty-four cour&s;es; every cour&s;e began its &s;ervice on the Sabbath-day, and continued all the week. Only four of the&s;e cour&s;es returned from the Babyloni&s;h captivity; the re&s;t were either extinct, or tarried behind. But, that the number of twenty-four might &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, each cour&s;e divided it&s;elf into &s;ix; the new ones taking upon them&s;elves the names of tho&s;e who were wanting. Zacharias was of the cour&s;e of Abia, one of the new ones in this &s;ub-divi&s;ion, and the eighth in the order of the twenty-four. It was the lot of this aged prie&s;t to burn incen&s;e in the holy place, and while the &s;moke of the incen&s;e a&s;cended, the people, according to cu&s;tom, were praying in the outward court. As the good prie&s;t &s;tood by the altar of incen&s;e, the angel ap|peared in view, all bright and glorious, as a native of the &s;ky. Zacharias, at the &s;ight of the heavenly me&s;&s;enger, was filled with terror and di&s;may; but the angel, with conde|&s;cending
<PB N="12" REF="029927_0012_0FE33560276407B8">
goodne&s;s, thus addre&s;&s;ed him: <HI>Fear not, Zacharias; for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth &s;hall bear the a &s;on, and thou &s;halt call his name John. And thou &s;halt have joy and gladne&s;s, and many &s;hall rejoice at his birth: for he &s;hall be great in the &s;ight of the Lord, and &s;hall neither drink wine nor &s;trong drink; and he &s;hall be filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, even from his mother's womb. And many of the children of I&s;rael &s;hall he turn unto the Lord their God. And he &s;hall go before him in the &s;pirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the di&s;obedient to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</HI> As Zacharias was one of the pious Jews who waited for the con&s;o|lation of I&s;rael, doubtle&s;s he had often prayed that he might live to &s;ee the Me&s;&s;iah come, which was the prayer that the angel a&s;&s;ured him was heard; but that his wife Elizabeth &s;hould bear a &s;on, who &s;hould be the forerunner of the Redeemer of I&s;rael, &s;eemed a thing &s;o extraordinary, and out of the cour&s;e of nature, that the prie&s;t could not believe it, though a&s;&s;erted by an angel; and therefore replied to the heavenly me&s;&s;enger: <HI>Whereby &s;hall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well &s;tricken in years.</HI> The bright commander of the angelic &s;quadrons, &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed that Zacharias &s;hould que&s;tion the truth of his prediction; and therefore proceeded to let him know his dignity, and the high place he occupied in the heavenly world; and the con&s;equential impo&s;&s;ibility that he &s;hould deceive him. Know, &s;aid he, that <HI>I am Gabriel that &s;tand in the pre&s;ence of God, and am &s;ent</HI> from heaven, <HI>to &s;peak unto thee, and to &s;hew thee the&s;e glad tidings.</HI> But, as thou ha&s;t pre&s;umed to call in que&s;tion the truth of the heavenly me&s;&s;age, <HI>thou &s;halt be dumb, and not able to &s;peak, until th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e things &s;hall be performed:</HI> for though thou ha&s;t not believed my words, they neverthele&s;s are true, <HI>and &s;hall be performed in their &s;ea&s;on.</HI> The prie&s;t, a&s;toni&s;hed at the vi&s;ion, &s;tayed longer in the holy place than u&s;ual; at which the people, who waited without for his benediction, were much &s;urpri&s;ed: at la&s;t he came to them, but found the prediction of the angel awfully fulfilled; for when, according to the cour&s;e of his office, he was to ble&s;s the people, he could not &s;peak; but &s;ignified to them by &s;igns, that he had &s;een a vi&s;ion, which was the cau&s;e of his dumbne&s;s; and, the week of his admini&s;tration being accompli&s;hed, he returned to his hou&s;e. Soon after this, his wife Elizabeth found her&s;elf with child, but made a &s;ecret of her conception for the fir&s;t five months, contenting her&s;elf with giving God thanks in private, for his great goodne&s;s in taking away the reproach of her barrenne&s;s; and revolving in her mind, with wonder and prai&s;e, the un&s;earchable coun&s;els of God, and his great goodne&s;s to the children of men.</P>
<P>SIX months after this, the angel Gabriel, the &s;ame who had appeared to the prophet Daniel, and foretold the very time of our Redeemer's birth, and had lately predicted to Zacharias the birth of his forerunner, was &s;ent from the heavenly regions, to the city of Nazareth, to an amiable and virtuous virgin, named Mary, &s;uppo&s;ed to be about fifteen years of age. She was of the hou&s;e and lineage of David, and was e&s;pou&s;ed to a good man, &s;uppo&s;ed to be a widower, and pretty far advanced in years, named Jo&s;eph, who was al&s;o of the royal line of David. The hu&s;band had not taken home his wife, but &s;he remained a virgin at her father's hou&s;e; and while, as &s;uppo&s;ed, at her private devotions, the angel appeared to her arrayed in heavenly brightne&s;s; and, with a conde&s;cending &s;mile, &s;aluted her in terms of the highe&s;t re&s;pect: <HI>Hail Mary,</HI> he cried, <HI>thou art highly favoured; the Lord is with thee: ble&s;&s;ed art thou among&s;t women.</HI> The pious maid was not more &s;urpri&s;ed at the blaze of heavenly glory which &s;hone around her, than at the &s;alutation of the coele&s;tial me&s;&s;enger, to whom &s;he knew not how to reply. When the angel rejoined, with looks and accents of &s;uch kindne&s;s, and heavenly goodne&s;s, as di&s;&s;ipated every fearful apprehen&s;ion. <HI>Fear not, Mary; for thou ha&s;t found favour with God. And behold thou &s;halt conceive and bring forth a Son, and &s;hall call his name JESUS; he &s;hall be great and &s;hall be

called the Son of the Highe&s;t: and the Lord God &s;hall give him the throne of his father David, and he &s;hall reign over the hou&s;e of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there &s;hall be no end.</HI> The holy maid, not immediately recollecting that the prophet I&s;aiah had, in his predictions of the Me&s;&s;iah &s;aid, <HI>Behold a virgin &s;hall conceive and bear a &s;on:</HI> and being con&s;cious of her purity, did not, like Zacharias, require a &s;ign; but mode&s;tly inquired how her pregnancy could be effected in her virgin &s;tate. <HI>How,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>can this be, &s;eeing I know not a man?</HI> To which the angel, with conde&s;cending goodne&s;s, replied, <HI>The Holy Gho&s;t &s;hall come upon thee, and the power of the Highe&s;t &s;hall over&s;hadow thee: therefore al&s;o, that holy thing which &s;hall be born of thee &s;hall be called the &s;on of God.</HI> And though the holy maid had not required a &s;ign, whereby &s;he might be a&s;&s;ured of the certainty of an event &s;o won|derful, and contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of nature, the heavenly gue&s;t was plea&s;ed to give her this &s;atisfaction: <HI>And behold,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>thy cou&s;in Elizabeth, &s;he hath al&s;o conceived a &s;on in her old age, and this is the &s;ixth month with her who was called barren: for with God nothing &s;hall be impo&s;&s;ible.</HI> This reply was accompanied with &s;uch a manife&s;tation of the Divine Pre&s;ence, that it removed every fear, and filled the wondering maid with heavenly gladne&s;s, which &s;he had not known before. The expectation of the MESSIAH was general at this time throughout the Jewi&s;h nation, and &s;trong were the de&s;ires of Judah's daughters for the honour and happine&s;s of being the mother of the Redeemer of I&s;rael; and the holy maid, it may be expected, had ardently wi&s;hed for this great ble&s;&s;ing; &s;o that, with growing joy and exultation, &s;he immediately replied to the bright arch-angel, <HI>Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word.</HI></P>
<P>SOON after the departure of the angel, the holy virgin, regarding with joy of heart what the heavenly me&s;&s;enger had related concerning her relation and friend, went to the hill country of Judea, to pay a vi&s;it to her cou&s;in Elizabeth. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that Zacharias lived at Hebron, the city of David, before he went to Jeru&s;alem, formerly inhabited by giants, but taken by Jo&s;hua; and, when the land was divided, given to the tribe of Judah; which city was about &s;eventy miles from Nazareth. The joy that in&s;pired the ble&s;&s;ed virgin, gave her &s;uch a flow of &s;pirits, that &s;he lightly tripped over the mountains; and as &s;oon as &s;he arrived at the hou&s;e of her dear relative, the pious matron was filled with divine illuminations, and &s;o affected at the &s;ound of the maiden's voice, that the evangeli&s;t informs us, <HI>the babe leaped in her womb.</HI> And, being filled with heavenly rap|ture, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed the wondering maid in the &s;ame language which &s;he had lately heard from the angel, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed art thou amongst women;</HI> to which &s;he added, <HI>and ble&s;&s;ed is the fruit of thy womb:</HI> and &s;till continuing full of heavenly ardour, &s;he exclaimed, <HI>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord &s;hould come to me!</HI> &s;he then proceeded immediately to inform her of her happy pregnancy, <HI>For to,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>as &s;oon as the voice of thy &s;alutation &s;ounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</HI> And then, in full a&s;&s;urance of the fulfilment of the divine predictions re&s;pecting them both, &s;he added, <HI>And ble&s;&s;ed is &s;he that believeth, for there &s;hall be a performance of tho&s;e things which were told her from the Lord.</HI> The divine flame of holy&punc;love and joy, which glowed in the heart of the pious matron, &s;oon catched in the bo&s;om of the holy virgin; who, confirmed beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, in the truth of the angel's prediction, by what &s;he had now heard from her dear relation, proceeded with a heart full of gratitude and holy joy, to ble&s;s, and prai&s;e, and magnify the name of the Lord, for his great goodne&s;s to her, in appointing her to be the mother of the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>AFTER three months &s;tay with her dear relative, the virgin Mary returned to her own city Nazareth; and being now the fourth month, her pregnancy plainly appeared; which gave great concern to Jo&s;eph, her e&s;pou&s;ed hu&s;band. But though he apprehended &s;he had
<PB N="14" REF="029927_0014_0FE33564D11AE418">
been &s;educed, yet having a &s;incere affection for her, and being of a kind and compa&s;&s;ion|ate di&s;po&s;ition, he was not willing to proceed to the &s;everity of the law; which in this ca&s;e, was no le&s;s than her being &s;toned to death at the door of her father's hou&s;e. But as he had ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that her honour could not be vindicated, and being a &s;trict ob&s;erver of the law, he was not willing to take her to his bed; but &s;tood determined to break the marriage contract as privately as po&s;&s;ible. While with great vexation and trou|ble, he was ruminating on the&s;e things, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, and informed him of the nature of his wife's pregnancy; giving him, at the &s;ame time, full &s;atisfaction concerning her innocency. <HI>Fear not,</HI> &s;aid the heavenly vi&s;ion, <HI>Jo&s;eph thou &s;on of David, to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her, is of the Holy Gho&s;t. And &s;he &s;hall bring forth a Son, and thou &s;halt call his name JESUS, for he &s;hall &s;ave his people from their &s;ins.</HI> It was with un&s;peakable joy, that the good man received this in|formation; and, not he&s;itating a moment re&s;pecting the truth of the heavenly me&s;&s;age, he took the lovely maid home to his hou&s;e. But the evangeli&s;t informs us, that <HI>he knew her not, till &s;he had brought forth her fir&s;t born Son.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e things were in agitation at Nazareth, Elizabeth the wife of Zacharias the prie&s;t, and relative of the favoured virgin, having completed the full time of her preg|nancy, was delivered of a &s;on. The reproach of her barrenne&s;s being thus removed, her neighbours and friends rejoiced with her; the whole family &s;miled at the event, and every heart was glad. On the eighth day, when they attended on the &s;acred rite of cir|cumci&s;ion, the relations propo&s;ed that he &s;hould be named Zacharias, after his father; but the mother informed them that his name mu&s;t be John. All the gue&s;ts wondered at this, becau&s;e it was a name never known in the family, and for the deci&s;ion of the affair, they applied to the father. The good man being dumb &s;ince the appearance of the angel who predicted the birth of the child, could not inform them, but made &s;igns for a writing table, and wrote, <HI>His name is John.</HI> The relations wondered at this, but more at ob&s;erving the old man's dumbne&s;s to cea&s;e from that moment, who&s;e voice, ri&s;ing clearer and &s;tronger for having been &s;o long &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, rai&s;ed loud &s;trains of joy and gladne&s;s, and lofty prai&s;es to the God of I&s;rael, for his great goodne&s;s, in remembering and vi&s;iting his people; and, full of prophetic rapture, turning to his infant &s;on, <HI>And thou child,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;halt be called the prophet of the Highe&s;t: for thou &s;halt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his ways; to give knowledge of &s;alvation unto his people; by the remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the day &s;pring from on high hath vi&s;ited us, to give light to them that &s;it in darkne&s;s, and in the &s;hadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</HI> Such were the circum&s;tances which attended the birth of the forerunner of our great Redeemer; the report of which &s;oon &s;pread through the hill country of Judea, and va|rious were the conceptions of the people concerning the future greatne&s;s of the child. The infant &s;oon grew &s;trong and robu&s;t, he was remarkably &s;imple and ab&s;temious in his diet, plain and carele&s;s in his dre&s;s, and addicted to &s;olitude and contemplation. Sacred hi&s;tory gives us no information what afterwards became of his parents; but there is a tradition that the mother fled into the de&s;erts with her infant &s;on, to pre&s;erve him from the rage of Herod; and that the father was &s;lain in the outer court of the temple, by the orders of that tyrant; and is that Zacharias which Chri&s;t mentions, who&s;e blood was &s;hed between the temple and the altar.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE great King of the creation and righteous Governor of the univer&s;e, having fixed in his eternal coun&s;els, both the time and the place where his only &s;on was to be born; &s;o ordered the affairs of the world, as to bring his great predictions and gracious de&s;igns to pa&s;s. And as he over-rules the coun&s;els of princes, and determines the actions of men, &s;o as to an&s;wer the wi&s;e ends of his government, and accompli&s;h the de&s;igns of his grace; &s;o in this pre&s;ent in&s;tance, there is a remarkable manife&s;tation of divine wi&s;|dom and power co-operating to bring about this great event. The holy Virgin and her hu&s;band dwelt at Nazareth; and, according to the prophet's prediction, the Me&s;&s;iah was to be born at Bethlehem, which was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; but to bring the great prediction to pa&s;s, Divine Providence &s;o ordered it, that about three years before the time of our Redeemer's birth, a decree pa&s;&s;ed at Rome, by the order of the emperor Augu&s;tus, that a &s;urvey &s;hould be taken, and a regi&s;ter made, of the per&s;ons e&s;tates and wealth, contained in his va&s;t empire. This &s;urvey &s;eems not to have been taken with an imme|diate de&s;ign of taxation, but rather from views of ambition, or that the emperor might know the number and riches of his &s;ubjects; for there were no taxes gathered by the Romans till eleven or twelve years after this, when Archelius the &s;on of Herod, was de|po&s;ed for his tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, and Judea reduced into the form of a Roman pro|vince; for Herod, and the re&s;t of the tributary kings, received the taxes of their &s;ub|jects, and paid &s;uch tribute to Rome as was &s;tipulated between them and the emperor. This &s;urvey, having been carried through various provinces and kingdoms which were &s;ubject to Rome, in the two years pa&s;t, was now making in Judea; and every family re|ceived orders from Herod to repair to their own city, to give an account of their real or per&s;onal e&s;tates, and there to be regi&s;tered. Jo&s;eph and Mary his wife, being both of the family of David, were obliged, on this occa&s;ion, to take a journey to the ancient city of Bethlehem. The evangeli&s;ts Matthew and Luke have in&s;erted in their Go&s;pels, the genealogy of JESUS CHRIST, in which there is &s;o great a variation, that it is with rea&s;on concluded, that Matthew gives us the genealogy of Jo&s;eph, and Luke of the Virgin Mary; that it may appear they were both of the hou&s;e and lineage of David; one ri&s;ing through Solomon, and the other through Nathan, another &s;on of that prince. Though the holy Virgin was great with child, and near the time of her delivery, &s;he could not be excu&s;ed from this long journey. The town of Bethlehem was crouded on this occa&s;ion; every inn, and every hou&s;e of ho&s;pitable entertainment was full; the extraordinary per&s;ons who are the &s;ubjects of our pre&s;ent attention, made no great appearance in the world, and could not command the be&s;t accommodations: and while tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;uperior affluence commanded re&s;pect, took up the be&s;t apartments of the inns, the mother of the great Me&s;&s;iah was content to lodge in a &s;table; and there, having accompli&s;hed the full time of her pregnancy, &s;he was delivered of her heavenly &s;on. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed, that, as &s;he had conceived by the mighty power of God, &s;he brought forth her &s;on without pain, or common a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The &s;table in which our great Re|deemer was born, is &s;aid to be a cave cut out of a rock; and it is not unlikely that he was born in the night. In this &s;ituation the holy virgin, having brought forth her &s;on, wrapped the infant in &s;waddling clothes, and, having no better accommodations, laid him in a manger. What an amazing in&s;tance of conde&s;cen&s;ion was this! The Son of the
<PB N="16" REF="029927_0016_0FE33570E00DB040">
Eternal God! The Heir of all things! The Darling of the &s;kies! Who was wor&s;hipped by angels, and held in veneration equal with heaven's Great Supreme; to become man; to take human nature upon him in its mo&s;t helple&s;s and feeble &s;tate; to lay a&s;ide his &s;tarry crown, and all the glories of his heavenly dignity, and become a &s;uckling child! One would have thought, that when the great King of the univer&s;e conde&s;cended to become man, and appear in this world, that he would have been received by the inhabitants of the earth with tokens of the highe&s;t regard; and that every thing great and good, every thing grand and noble, would have been prepared to honour and accommodate the mighty prince. It might have been particularly expected, that the nation which he cho&s;e for his re&s;idence, that people whom he conde&s;cended to make his countrymen, would have received him with the highe&s;t acclamations, and warme&s;t tokens of honour and re&s;pect. But how contrary to this were the councils of heaven! how oppo&s;ite to this, the ap|pearance of our great Redeemer! When great princes are born, the city of their birth rings with acclamations, and the illuminated night &s;hines like the day. But when our exalted Redeemer was born, all was &s;ilent, all was &s;till. Not the poor pea&s;ant, who fir&s;t draws breath in the homely cottage, &s;teals into the world le&s;s unob&s;erved, than did the Son of God. He, in all probability was born in the night, perhaps without light, or by the glimmering of a winking taper. When great princes are born, they are wrapped in fine linen, and adorned with mantles of purples fringed with gold: the floors of their apartments are decorated with &s;plendid carpets, the windows are adorned with noble hangings, and they lie on a bed of &s;tate, which &s;hines with crim&s;on and with gold. But our great Redeemer, and Saviour of mankind, the greate&s;t Prince that ever was born into the world, received no honour, no tokens of re&s;pect; was received with no demon|&s;trations of joy; had no &s;plendid apartment, no rich decorations: but was brought forth in a &s;table, without any per&s;on to put on the poor habit prepared for him, but his virgin mother, who her&s;elf wrapped him in &s;waddling clothes, and laid him in a manger: but though our glorious Redeemer was received, by the inhabitants of the earth, with no tokens of re&s;pect, or demon&s;trations of joy; though he was brought forth in the incommodious limits of a &s;table, and his companions were the bea&s;ts of the field; he was not neglected or di&s;regarded by the bright natives of the heavenly world. A &s;qua|dron of &s;hining cherubs was di&s;patched from the eternal throne, to proclaim the great event, to congratulate the wondering world on their great Deliverer's birth, and pro|claim the approach of the exalted Prince of peace. But this report was to be made; not to the great Sanhedrim; not to the learned doctors of the law; not to the chief prie&s;ts and elders: but to a company of poor &s;hepherds, who were watching their flocks by night, in the fields of Bethlehem. The rays of heavenly glory which attended this &s;hining train, breaking through the darkne&s;s of night, alarmed and terrified the artle&s;s &s;wains. But one of the angels called to them from on high: <HI>Fear not, for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be unto all people: for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Chri&s;t the Lord. And this &s;hall be a &s;ign unto you, ye &s;hall find the babe wrapped in &s;waddling clothes, lying in a manger.</HI> No &s;ooner had the angel uttered the&s;e words, than the re&s;t of the &s;quadron, who attended him down the &s;kies, appeared; a flood of light illumined the whole concave of heaven, and angels &s;ongs were heard on earthly ground. <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, on earth peace, and good will towards men,</HI> was the &s;train they &s;ung. And, having ended the coele&s;tial concert, they vani&s;hed out of &s;ight. Soon as the angelic ho&s;t was departed, the wondering &s;hepherds repaired to Bethlehem, to &s;eek the heavenly infant, who&s;e birth had in this glorious manner been related. And, as the angels had declared, they found the holy child, at|tended only by his virgin mother, and his &s;uppo&s;ed father Jo&s;eph; the babe was wrapped in the meane&s;t clothes, and laid in a manger. The&s;e circum&s;tances an&s;wering &s;o per|fectly
<PB N="17" REF="029927_0017_0FE3357265CAFCE0">
to the heavenly declaration, confirmed the affected &s;hepherds, who, with the mo&s;t ardent joy, adored the holy infant, and related to his wondering parents, what a glorious appearance they had &s;een, and what great things the angels had related concerning the child. The Shepherds then, with exultation and joy, returned to their flocks, declaring to all men, the great things which they had &s;een, and prai&s;ing God for his conde&s;cending goodne&s;s, in this unexpected manife&s;tation of his great de&s;igns, to per&s;ons &s;o low and incon&s;iderable in the world. When the &s;hepherds were departed, the virgin mother of the Lord of life recollected, with adoration and prai&s;e, the various concurring te&s;timonies of the divinity of her &s;on; and trea&s;ured them up in her heart, with full expectation of being accompli&s;hed in him, which had been predicted by the prophets concerning the Redeemer of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>WHEN the eighth day was arrived, &s;ince the birth of the holy child, he was circum|ci&s;ed in conformity to the command of the law of Mo&s;es; and received the name of JESUS, according to the direction of the angel, who predicted his conception and birth.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE holy Virgin and her pious hu&s;band Jo&s;eph, having performed all that the law required in the &s;acred rite of circumci&s;ion, and it being nece&s;&s;ary, that the heavenly infant &s;hould, at the end of forty days, be pre&s;ented in the temple; it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that they remained at Bethlehem till tho&s;e days were accompli&s;hed; for Jeru|&s;alem was but about &s;ix miles from Bethlehem, but a much greater di&s;tance from Nazareth, the place of their re&s;idence. The days of her purification being fulfilled, the virgin mother, according to the rules pre&s;cribed by the law, accompanied by her hu&s;band, brought her young &s;on to the temple: &s;he waited in the outer court, while the two turtle-doves, which, conformable to her mean condition, &s;he had brought for her offering, were pre&s;ented by the prie&s;t as an oblation to the Lord; &s;he was then admitted into the inner court, where the prie&s;t received the ble&s;&s;ed infant from his mother's arms, and pre&s;ented him to the Lord, at the altar of burnt offering; and received the five &s;hekels, which the law exacted of every family, without regard to their circum&s;tances, for the redemption of a fir&s;t-born &s;on. The God, whom I&s;rael expected, then <HI>&s;uddenly came to his temple: and the glory of the latter hou&s;e was greater than the former.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e &s;acred rites were performing, a pious and venerable old man came into the temple, who&s;e name was Simeon: he had long waited, and earne&s;tly prayed for the redemption of I&s;rael; and it had been revealed to him, by the &s;pirit of God, that be|fore he died, he &s;hould &s;ee the exalted Me&s;&s;iah. Accordingly the &s;pirit which now di|rected his &s;teps to the temple, impre&s;&s;ed on his mind a clear and &s;trong conviction, that the infant, now pre&s;enting at the altar, was this glorious per&s;on. Full of heavenly tran&s;port, he took the holy ble&s;&s;ed infant in his arms and addre&s;&s;ed the throne of that God, who had thus highly favoured him, in &s;uch language as this: <HI>Lord, now lette&s;t thou thy &s;ervant depart in peace, according to thy word: for mine eyes have &s;een thy &s;alvation, which thou ha&s;t prepared before the face of all people: a light to enlighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people I&s;rael.</HI> It may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e words were heard with wonder and joy,
<PB N="18" REF="029927_0018_0FE33573EC49B520">
by the parents of the holy child: for it mu&s;t certainly &s;eem &s;trange to them, that the good old man &s;hould be acquainted with the great things which concerned the heavenly infant; and they doubtle&s;s had rea&s;on to wonder how he came by the information: but turning to the virgin mother, he added, <HI>Behold, this child is &s;et for the fall and ri&s;ing again of many in I&s;rael.</HI> In the&s;e remarkable words, the venerable old man prophe&s;ied the oppo&s;ition which the Go&s;pel of CHRIST &s;hould meet with in the world; and &s;hewed that the de&s;truction of many would be the con&s;equence of their final unbelief and di&s;obedience; yet, at the &s;ame time, many would ri&s;e out of that dreadful condition, into which they were fallen by their &s;ins, by being enabled to believe in the Son of God, and apply to their &s;ouls the benefits of his great &s;alvation. The holy prophet proceeded further to inform the mother of our Lord, that her &s;on &s;hould be &s;et up as a mark, at which the unbelieving and di&s;obedient &s;hould level all the darts of their infernal fury; and that the &s;orrows that &s;he would feel on that account, would be exceedingly cutting, and painful: <HI>Yea,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>a &s;word &s;hall pierce through thy own &s;oul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</HI> The prophecy was remarkably fulfilled, when the holy Virgin, about thirty-three years after this, &s;tood by the cro&s;s, and, in all the bitterne&s;s of grief, beheld the &s;ufferings of her expiring &s;on. Various have been the conjectures concerning this good old man Simeon; but who he was, is not decided with any degree of certainty. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed him to be a prie&s;t; others have imagined he was Simeon the Ju&s;t, a great per&s;on who bore an excellent character among&s;t the Jews; others have concluded him to be the &s;on of Hillel, a famous doctor in the Sanhedrim. But, as the evangeli&s;ts are &s;ilent in the&s;e particulars, they mu&s;t be left without any further enquiry.</P>
<P>THE te&s;timony of this great per&s;on was confirmed by that of an aged matron, named Anna, whom the evangeli&s;t calls a prophete&s;s; and declares, that <HI>&s;he departed not from the temple, but &s;erved God, with fa&s;tings and prayers, night and day.</HI> The meaning of which is, that &s;he had dedicated her&s;elf to the &s;ervice of God, and con&s;tantly attended on his wor&s;hip in the temple. She had been married in her youth, and lived &s;even years with her hu&s;band: after his death, &s;he continued in a &s;tate of widowhood, and was now far advanced in years. She came into the temple, while the aged Simeon held our great Redeemer in his arms; and, filled with heavenly rapture, ble&s;&s;ed and prai&s;ed the Lord for his infinite mercy, in remembering his people; and &s;pake of the heavenly child <HI>to all them that looked for redemption in Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Every thing which the law required concerning the redemption and pre&s;enting the holy child, being performed, Jo&s;eph and his family returned to Galilee, and dwelt in their own city Nazareth. But, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that they did not long remain there, but &s;ettling their affairs, they &s;oon returned to Bethlehem, and, with the heavenly infant, dwelt there.</P>
<P>WHILE the holy family dwelt at Bethlehem, there came to Jeru&s;alem, a company of ea&s;tern philo&s;ophers, or wi&s;e men. There had been a tradition &s;pread all over the ea&s;tern nations, that a great king was to be born to the Jews, who would gain the empire of the world. This tradition is &s;uppo&s;ed to have ari&s;en from the Jews, who were &s;cattered throughout the various nations of the Ea&s;t; and Zoroa&s;ter, the reformer of the Per&s;ian religion, &s;aid to be a &s;ervant to the prophet Daniel, copied into his book &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages out of the Old Te&s;tament, and cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have omitted the famous prophecies concerning the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah. At the time of our Redeemer's birth, a remarkable &s;tar, or luminous appearance, was &s;een in tho&s;e countries, which induced the learned men of tho&s;e times to conclude, that this &s;plendid luminary denoted the birth of that extraordinary per&s;on: and &s;o fully were they &s;atisfied that their conclu&s;ion was true, that a company of learned men actually came to Jeru&s;alem on this errand. Whether they were princes, prie&s;ts, or philo&s;ophers; how many there were in number; from
<PB N="19" REF="029927_0019_0FE3357571126890">
what country they came, or how many days they arrived at Jeru&s;alem after the birth of CHRIST, are que&s;tions which have puzzled the learned in all ages, but have never yet obtained a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. However, it is a certain matter of fact, that, <HI>when Je&s;us was born in Bethlehem in Judea, in the days of Herod the king, there came wi&s;e men from the Ea&s;t to Jeru&s;alem, &s;aying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have &s;een his &s;tar in the Ea&s;t, and are come to wor&s;hip him.</HI> The appearance of the&s;e per&s;ons, the report, and the inquiry they made, alarmed and terrified the jealous old tyrant: for though by rea&s;on of his years, and ill &s;tate of health, he could not expect long to hold the crown; he could not bear the thought of a prince being born that was de&s;tined to that high dignity. And, as it had been his con&s;tant practice to murder every one who had a greater right to the crown than him&s;elf, he &s;oon concluded, that the young child, when found, &s;hould add to the number of tho&s;e murders he had been guilty of, to rear his throne, and to &s;up|port it: but he craftily concealed his wicked de&s;ign, &s;pake to the &s;trangers fair, and &s;um|moned the Sanhedrim to an&s;wer their enquiry, where the Me&s;&s;iah was to be born. He &s;oon received their an&s;wer, and was informed, that Bethlehem in Judea, was the place where CHRIST was to be born: <HI>for thus it was written by the prophet, And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art not the lea&s;t amongst the princes of Judah: for out of thee &s;hall come a Governor, that &s;hall rule my people I&s;rael.</HI> The gloomy tyrant, &s;atisfied with this reply, &s;ent for the noble &s;trangers; and &s;eeming well plea&s;ed with the event, diligently inquired after every circum&s;tance which might throw light on the affair; and &s;ent them to Bethlehem, de&s;iring them, when they had found the child, to return to Jeru&s;alem, and direct him to the place of his abode; and he pretended, that he would wait on him him&s;elf, and appoint him &s;uch honours as his high dignity required. The wi&s;e men received this in|telligence with great &s;atisfaction, and gladly &s;et out for Bethlehem; when, to their un|&s;peakable joy, they &s;aw, going before them, the &s;ame luminous appearance which they had &s;een in their own country: this glorious &s;tar &s;topped at Bethlehem, and &s;tood directly over the hou&s;e where the heavenly infant was. Thus directed by divine wi&s;dom and power, they approached the &s;acred babe with adoration and joy, and having fallen down and wor&s;hipped him, they pre&s;ented their offerings of gold, frankincen&s;e, and myrrh. But when they departed, they returned not to Jeru&s;alem, but went to their own country another way; for the Lord had warned them in a dream, not to return to Herod with the information he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>HERE may be ob&s;erved the particular care of Divine Providence, in the pre&s;ervation of the holy child; for Herod, who was one of the mo&s;t crafty tyrants that ever exi&s;ted, did not act in this ca&s;e with his u&s;ual circum&s;pection. He had no other notion of the Me&s;&s;iah, but that of his &s;itting up a temporal kingdom, and &s;uppo&s;ed that this child would drive both him&s;elf and his family from the throne; and on this account he had re&s;olved to put the infant to death. But is it not &s;trange that he &s;hould not have went him&s;elf, or &s;ent &s;ome of his officers, or &s;pies along with the wi&s;e men, and prevented the e&s;cape of his de&s;tined prey? The character and conduct of Herod in almo&s;t every ca&s;e, is contrary to this: but the great Governor of the univer&s;e, when he plea&s;es can ca&s;t confu&s;ion on the councils of princes, and pre&s;erve the innocent from their wicked de&s;igns.</P>
<P>WE are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;atisfying the curio&s;ity of the&s;e noble &s;trangers, was the only end which Providence had in view, when it directed them, in this extraordinary manner, to the place of our Redeemer's birth, and in&s;pired them with &s;uch &s;entiments concerning him. Several great and important ends were an&s;wered by this vi&s;it; it &s;hewed to &s;ucceeding generations, beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, that there was an expectation, among&s;t the heathen nations, that a great king would at this time appear among&s;t the Jews; and it is manife&s;t from hence, that there were prophecies among&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="029927_0020_0FE3357DC43A4A68">
the Gentiles, which in&s;pired them with a con&s;tant hope, that &s;ome great things would be done for mankind, by this exalted per&s;on. And it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e great men, when they returned to their own country, publi&s;hed abroad through various nations, the tidings of what they had &s;een: and filling the world with the expectations of the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah, prepared the various nations for the reception of his glorious go&s;pel. Thus, while the Jews continued in the blindne&s;s of ob&s;tinacy and unbelief, va&s;t multitudes of the Heathens received the go&s;pel, rejoiced in the truth, and dwelt under the benign influence of the great Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. It may further be noted, that the coming of the&s;e philo&s;ophers to Jeru&s;alem at this time, on &s;uch an errand, produced the determination of the Jewi&s;h council, that it was the language of the prophets, that Bethlehem was de&s;tined by heaven to be the place of our Redeemer's birth. And it may further be ob&s;erved, that the &s;ea&s;onable pre&s;ents made to the holy family, by the&s;e beneficent and learned &s;trangers, enabled the good man to &s;upport his family in Egypt, where they &s;oon after this were &s;ent by divine direction, to e&s;cape the murdering fury of that execrable tyrant Herod.</P>
<P>THE wi&s;e men being departed to their own country, <HI>the angel of the Lord appeared to Jo&s;eph in a dream, &s;aying, Ari&s;e, and take the young child and his mother; and flee into Egypt, and be there until I bring thee word: for Herod will &s;eek the young child to de&s;troy him.</HI> Jo&s;eph immediately obeyed the divine command, and, for the greater &s;ecurity &s;et out from Bethlehem in the night: and taking a journey of near two hundred miles, he &s;ettled with his family in Egypt, and there he remained till the tyrant was dead. Herod, in the mean time, having waited for the return of the wi&s;e men in vain, and knowing he was hated by the Jews, was &s;o jealous, di&s;contented, and wicked, that he mi&s;tru&s;ted every body of plotting again&s;t him; and, perhaps, concluding, that the Jews might conceal this child till a proper opportunity &s;hould offer for them to bring him forth, was full of rage, and actuated by the mo&s;t infernal cruelty, &s;ent his &s;oldiers to Bethlehem, and the adjacent country, with orders to kill all the young children that were under two years old. The troops too punctually executed the orders of the dete&s;ted tyrant; and it is a&s;&s;erted by hi&s;torians, that fourteen thou&s;and young children fell in this bloody ma&s;&s;acre, and Judah's &s;treams ran infant blood. The horrid cruelty of this tran&s;action is &s;uch, that it is almo&s;t &s;ufficient to &s;tagger our belief. But if we con&s;ider the conduct and cha|racter of the man, that he was grown old in murder and cruelty; that he reared his throne in blood; that he was guilty of the mo&s;t horrid murders to &s;upport it; and at this very time, was mo&s;t deplorably mi&s;erable by quarrels in his family, and was con&s;tantly apprehen&s;ive of plots again&s;t his life: if we con&s;ider that he had no friend he could tru&s;t, but was jealous of all about him, and thought his own &s;ons con&s;pired to poi&s;on him; but we &s;hall not wonder at any degrees of wickedne&s;s, which &s;uch a man, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, might be capable of committing. But this horrid &s;cene, as it might be expected, was &s;oon followed by peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hed vengeance, which bur&s;t on the impious tyrant, and laid him low in death. In the utmo&s;t agonies of mind, and the acute&s;t torments of body, he &s;oon after this expired. He ordered the execution of his own &s;on but five days before his death, and he commande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all the nobility of the Jewi&s;h nation to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> put to death, as &s;oon as it was known that he had cea&s;ed to breathe. But the per&s;ons whom he tru&s;ted to execute this la&s;t order, not being &s;o wicked as him&s;elf, the noble pri&s;oners were &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>THIS affecting and terrible &s;laughter of the innocents, is pathetically de&s;cribed by the evangeli&s;t, in referring to a pa&s;&s;age in the prophet Jeremiah. <HI>Then was fulfilled that which was &s;poken by Jeremy the prophet, &s;aying, in Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, becau&s;e they were not.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="21" REF="029927_0023_0FE3358342506C28">SOME time after the tyrant was dead, the angel of the Lord appeared to Jo&s;eph, in Egypt, in a dream, and commanded him to take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of I&s;rael: at the &s;ame time informing him, that they were dead who &s;ought the young child's life. The good man, without he&s;itation, obeyed the heavenly vi&s;ion, and returning to his native country, de&s;igned to have &s;ettled in Judea, probably at Beth|lehem.

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Infancy of <HI>CHRIST</HI> and his di&s;puting with the Doctors in the Temple.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE account of our Lord's childhood and youth is very &s;lightly touched on in the &s;acred writings. How he was employed from his infancy, till he arrived at thirty years of age, is not to be found in any authentic hi&s;tory. This period includes the greate&s;t part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f his life, which is ab&s;olutely unknown to the Chri&s;tian world. St. Luke, who is the mo&s;t particular in his account of our Lord's younger years, only tells us, that <HI>the child grew, and waxed &s;trong in &s;pirit, filled with wi&s;dom; and the grace of God was upon him.</HI> And, &s;peaking of his life at his father's hou&s;e at Nazareth, he informs us, <HI>that he was &s;ubject to his parents, and that he increa&s;ed in wi&s;dom and &s;tature, and in favour with God and man.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ilence of the &s;acred writings, we are not to &s;uppo&s;e that the heavenly youth was &s;ubject to the common frailties of humanity, the follies of childhood and youth. It may naturally be concluded, from what is above declared, that the holy child was remarkable for a native grandeur and maje&s;tic mode&s;ty in his deport|ment; that his temper was the mo&s;t amiable, not peevi&s;h and petti&s;h, but all meekne&s;s, kindne&s;s, conde&s;cen&s;ion, and goodne&s;s; and that his mind was peculiarly turned to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and contemplation. It is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t amazing faculties and powers of mind; a &s;trong retentive memory; a lively imagination; a prodigious under&s;tanding; a penetrating judgment; and a remarkable &s;olidity and &s;edatene&s;s, which led him to the mo&s;t &s;incere and regular piety, and &s;piritual exerci&s;es of every kind. It is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that he &s;pent much time in private retirement, and in divine meditations, and &s;piritual conver&s;e with his heavenly Father; and that he behaved, in every re&s;pect, in &s;uch a manner to his friends and relations, as
<PB N="22" REF="029927_0024_0FE3358CB52408D0">
made him the mo&s;t amiable child, in the age in which he lived. It cannot be learned from the evangeli&s;ts that he had a liberal education; every account we have of the condition of his parents in the world, con&s;pires to prove that they were in low cir|cum&s;tances. Jo&s;eph was by trade a carpenter. JESUS abode with his parents till his public mini&s;try commenced, and, no doubt, worked with his &s;uppo&s;ed father at his trade. He is called in one place in the go&s;pels, the carpenter; and in another the carpenter's &s;on: &s;o that it may be concluded that he had no other learning than what his parents them&s;elves taught him, and what he might gather at the &s;ynagogue by attending to the reading of the law and the prophets. But it may be learned from the words of the evangeli&s;t above quoted, that the favour of God towards him was very apparent, and that the holy Spirit with which he was filled, appeared in his early youth. The wonderful advances he made in wi&s;dom, the vi&s;ible &s;trength and &s;teadine&s;s of his mind, and the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of his countenance, beyond what ever was &s;een before in one &s;o young, were plain vindications of his divinity, and were every day improving and increa&s;ing.</P>
<P>IT was the general cu&s;tom of the Jews to take a journey to Jeru&s;alem, and annually attend the fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over. The parents of our Great Redeemer, with their numerous relations and friends, when the holy child was twelve years old, went to the capital of the kingdom on this occa&s;ion. Whether the child JESUS had been at Jeru|&s;alem before, is not certainly known: it is generally concluded that he had not. Having remained &s;even days with them, during their attendance at the temple, he &s;eperated him&s;elf from the company, and, when they &s;et out on their return to their own country, &s;tayed behind. They proceeded on their fir&s;t day's journey, and did not mi&s;s him till night, &s;uppo&s;ing he might be in company with &s;ome of their relations, who had been at the holy city on the &s;ame occa&s;ion with them&s;elves, and were now returning. But in|quiring among&s;t all their kindred and friends, they learnt that he was not in the company. Full of anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s, they returned to Jeru&s;alem; and &s;earched every place in the city where he was likely to be found. Two days they &s;ought him in vain. On the third day, they found him in the outer court of the temple, among&s;t the learned doctors of the law, both hearing them, and a&s;king them que&s;tions.</P>
<P>IN the outer court of the temple, called the court of the people, were &s;everal chambers belonging to the prie&s;ts; and here the doctors of the law a&s;&s;embled at the fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over, and at other times, to teach the people; and not only expounded the Mo&s;aical in&s;titutions, but debated with one another, concerning the difficulties that occurred. Such youths as applied them&s;elves to learning, were permitted to conver&s;e with the a&s;&s;embly; and received &s;uch in&s;tructions as were nece&s;&s;ary to enable them to pur&s;ue their re&s;pective &s;tudies. At this a&s;&s;embly of the doctors, Je&s;us pre&s;ented him&s;elf, and not only gave attention to their debates, and propo&s;ed &s;uch que&s;tions, as naturally aro&s;e from the &s;ubjects under con&s;ideration; but propounded &s;everal difficult que&s;tions of his own, which, when the doctors could not clear up, he expounded him&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction and &s;urpri&s;e of all pre&s;ent. The learned doctors, with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, heard the young child manife&s;t &s;uch wi&s;dom and deep under&s;tanding, as not only exceeded men, but &s;uch men as were deputed the mo&s;t learned and judicious among&s;t them. No doubt there was &s;omething remarkably maje&s;tic and amiably divine in his appearance; and as he led the di&s;cour&s;e him&s;elf, we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that the que&s;tion which he debated with the doctors, had reference to &s;ome prophecy concerning the Me&s;&s;iah; which he threw &s;uch light upon, and explained in &s;uch a manner, as rai&s;ed the admiration and a&s;toni&s;h|ment of all that heard him. It is certainly very &s;trange, that the admiration which the holy child excited in this public a&s;&s;embly, by his under&s;tanding and pertinent an&s;wers, did not excite &s;ome further inquiry after him. But, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the coming
<PB N="23" REF="029927_0025_0FE3358E521EFE08">
of &s;uch mean per&s;ons as Jo&s;eph and Mary, who appeared to be his parents, very much abated the regard which the learned doctors of the law would otherwi&s;e have had for &s;o wonderful a child; but things which appear low in the world, are always de&s;pi&s;ed by tho&s;e lazy inquirers after truth, who &s;eek the prai&s;e of man, and are only candidates for popular applau&s;e.</P>
<P>JOSEPH and Mary, who had been &s;eeking the holy child with the utmo&s;t apprehen&s;ions and concern, found him in this &s;ituation with equal &s;urpri&s;e and joy. And there is no doubt but JESUS, when he perceived the approach of his parents, aro&s;e and went with them immediately; taking this occa&s;ion to withdraw him&s;elf from the admiring a&s;&s;embly. His mother was very much affected with the appearance of her &s;on, and the place and company in which &s;he had found him. She gently a&s;ked him, <HI>Why he had left them in this manner?</HI> rather inquiring into the rea&s;on of his &s;taying behind, than de&s;igning to blame or chide him: for, no doubt, &s;he perceived that he was under divine direction; yet proceeding to inform him, that her hu&s;band and her&s;elf had been extremely concerned for him, and had &s;ought him three days with the utmo&s;t anxiety and grief. The holy child, with the mo&s;t amiable meekne&s;s, informed her, that they need not have wearied them&s;elves with &s;eeking him, nor their minds with anxiety and care, for he was under the protection of his Father, on who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s he had been employed. The expre&s;&s;ions which the heavenly child u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, were not clearly under&s;tood by his won|dering parents; but his mother, on this, as on every other remarkable occurrence in the life and conduct of her &s;on, took notice of his words, and trea&s;ured them up in her heart: and the child JESUS, having given this early and remarkable in&s;tance of his dili|gence and ready obedience in the work in which he was to be hereafter employed, now proceeded to give an open and manife&s;t in&s;tance of his duty to his parents; for he re|turned with them to Nazareth, and was &s;ubject to them as before. Here he remained till he arrived at the age of thirty years, and made wonderful improvements in wi&s;dom and knowledge, being favoured by God in an extraordinary manner, and highly e&s;teemed, reverenced, and loved by all that knew him.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing expre&s;sly recorded in the evangeli&s;ts, relating to our Lord's life and conver&s;ation, from twelve years old, to the time when he entered on his public mini&s;try, which was at the age of thirty; but from &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, various circum|&s;tances may be collected. It is plain, from his parents &s;eeking him among&s;t his relations and acquaintance, when he was left behind at Jeru&s;alem, that he was of a familiar, friendly di&s;po&s;ition; that he had no objection to company and conver&s;ation, and that he lived in familiarity and friend&s;hip with his neighbours and relations: it is al&s;o evident, that, though the learned doctors, and the people in the temple, were filled with the highe&s;t admiration at the abilities and knowledge of JESUS, when a child; and, though afterwards, he, no doubt, gave to his mother and &s;ome few particular friends, plain proofs of his heavenly wi&s;dom; yet his conver&s;ation with the common people was &s;uch, as ca&s;t a veil over his divinity; and the general cour&s;e of his conduct and conver&s;e with the common people was &s;uch, that no noi&s;e was made about him, nor any great things expected from him in the Jewi&s;h nation, nor even in his own city. And it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that his mean appearance in the world, not a little contributed to prevent his being remarked and e&s;teemed for tho&s;e excellent qualities, which mu&s;t certainly be apparent in him; for we find he was afterwards reproached in his own city, for pretending to teach them, when they knew the meanne&s;s of his extraction, and his illiterate education: <HI>Whence,</HI> they cried, <HI>hath this man this wi&s;dom, and the&s;e mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's &s;on? Is not his mother named Mary, and his brethren James, and Jo&s;es, and Simon, and Judas? And his &s;i&s;ters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all the&s;e things.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="029927_0026_0FE33590057629B0">AND it may further be remarked, that the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS did not give him&s;elf any airs of &s;uperiority among&s;t his brethren and friends; but meekly conde&s;cended to attend to the meane&s;t employment, a&s;&s;i&s;ting the nece&s;&s;ities of his parents with his labour, and not being de&s;irous of popular applau&s;e. For as it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he weekly attended on the reading the law and the prophets in the &s;ynagogue, was it not &s;urpri&s;ing that he could hear the erroneous expo&s;itions, which, no doubt were frequently made, and remain &s;ilent at Nazareth, after he had di&s;puted with the learned doctors in the temple, and &s;ilenced the wi&s;e men of Jeru&s;alem? Herein appears the mo&s;t profound humility, and the mo&s;t con&s;ummate wi&s;dom of our Lord, in concealing his &s;uperior knowledge and under&s;tanding, when he might have gained the admiration and applau&s;e of his town&s;men, and have been ju&s;tly revered and e&s;teemed by all. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that Jo&s;eph did not live till CHRIST began his public mini&s;try, becau&s;e he is not mentioned in the Go&s;pels, after John began to baptize. Some of the antient writers have pretended to inform us what was the parti|cular &s;ort of carpentry which Jo&s;eph carried on: they &s;ay, it was making plows, yokes, and in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry for his neighbours. And it is not unlikely, that our Lord lived with his mother, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in carrying on the trade, after her hu&s;band's death: and hence, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, he is called by St. Mark, <HI>The carpenter, the &s;on of Mary.</HI></P>

<P>WE mu&s;t now pa&s;s over, in the hi&s;tory of the life of CHRIST, a period of eighteen years; all the account the evangeli&s;ts give of our Lord, during this time, is, that he dwelt at Nazareth, and was &s;ubject to his parents. But, having pa&s;&s;ed over this time in &s;ilence, all the evangeli&s;ts agree in giving the hi&s;tory of his entrance on his public mini&s;try, and the preparatory preaching of his great forerunner John the Bapti&s;t.</P>
<P>WHEN our Lord was about fourteen years of age, the emperor Augu&s;tus died, after a reign of about forty years. Great was the grief of the whole empire, at his death, for he was a prince of &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, and reigned with &s;uch wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, and goodne&s;s, as gained him the love of his &s;ubjects. He was &s;ucceeded by Tiberius, the &s;on of his wife Livia, by a former hu&s;band. Tiberius was admitted to a &s;hare in the govern|ment two or three years before the death of Augu&s;tus, and now &s;ucceeded without oppo|&s;ition. He was a prince of a di&s;po&s;ition va&s;tly different to that of his predece&s;&s;or, and governed the empire in &s;uch a manner, as rendered him ju&s;tly hated by his &s;ubjects. Archelaus, the &s;on of Herod the Great, had been depo&s;ed from the government of Judea about three years before the death of Augu&s;tus, and that country was reduced into the form of a Roman province. Rufus, who was governor of Judea, when the emperor died, was recalled in the &s;econd year of Tiberius, and Valerius Gratus was &s;ent to &s;ucceed him. He, having continued in Judea about eleven years, was recalled, and &s;uc|ceeded by Pontius Pilate, a man of a fierce, irreconcilable &s;pirit, and of a cruel, covetous di&s;po&s;ition, too much like his ma&s;ter Tiberius.</P>
<P>HEROD Antipas, the &s;on of Herod the Great, was tetrarch of Galilee; which dignity he had enjoyed twenty-eight years. His brother Philip was tetrarch of Iturea; and Ly|&s;anias
<PB N="25" REF="029927_0027_0FE335918A9E23C0">
of Abilene. The dignity of the high-prie&s;thood was ve&s;ted in Caiphas, the &s;on-in-law of Annas, who formerly had held that high office, and now was reverenced by the people as high-prie&s;t, and probably a&s;&s;i&s;ted his &s;on-in-law in the execution of the &s;acred duties of the prie&s;thood.</P>
<P>SUCH was the &s;tate of the Jewi&s;h nation at the time of the opening of the glorious go&s;pel; for in the fir&s;t year of the government of Pontius Pilate, <HI>the word of God came unto John, the Son of Zacharias, in the wilderne&s;s.</HI> The &s;acred writings have been &s;ilent, with regard to the manner in which this extraordinary man pa&s;&s;ed the former time of his life; but there is an ancient tradition, that Elizabeth, hearing of the terrible &s;laughter which that execrable tyrant Herod made among the young children at Bethlehem, fled into the wilderne&s;s, to &s;ecure her child from his murdering cruelty and rage: and there attended him with all the care and tenderne&s;s of an affectionate mother. The child was about eighteen months old at the time of her flight, and about forty days after her abode in the de&s;art, &s;he died. His father Zacharias, next time he officiated in the temple, was &s;lain by Herod, becau&s;e he would not di&s;cover the place of his &s;on's retreat. The helple&s;s infant, being thus deprived of all a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his parents, the Lord, who had a great work for him to accompli&s;h, had mercy on him; and &s;ent an angel to be his defender and &s;upport, till he was able to provide for him&s;elf. Whether this tradition is true or fal&s;e, cannot be a&s;certained; but it is a certain fact, a&s;&s;erted by the evangeli&s;ts, <HI>that he abode in the de&s;ert till the day of his &s;hewing unto I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>SOME learned men, who have been at great pains in endeavouring to fix the preci&s;e time when the prophet John began his public mini&s;try, have fixed it to the month of October, and at the time of the proclamation of a year of jubilee. They &s;ay, that his preaching began on the great day of atonement, when the high-prie&s;t went into the holy of holies. This was a particular day of penitence, and, it is &s;aid in the law, who|&s;oever did not afflict his &s;oul, &s;hould be cut off from the people. This day is &s;uppo&s;ed to an&s;wer to our nineteenth of October, and was the day whereon, by the &s;olemn &s;ounding of trumpets, the thirtieth jubilee of the Jews was proclaimed, which was the la&s;t they ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>THIS extraordinary per&s;on, in his appearance, and his way of life, very much re&s;embled the antient prophets, particularly Elijah, to whom he had been compared in prophecy. The coar&s;ene&s;s of his clothing, and the hardne&s;s of his fare, were very remarkable: his garment was made of camel's hair, probably the &s;ack-cloth &s;o often mentioned in the &s;acred writings, to be worn by penitents and mourners; and his food, the wild productions of the wilderne&s;s: locu&s;ts and wild honey, were his only provi&s;ions, and his drink, the clear cold water which bubbled from the mo&s;&s;y &s;pring. In this &s;ituation, he began the work of God, and preached in the wilderne&s;s of Judea, <HI>Repent! for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</HI> The remarkable au&s;terity of his life, and the air and appearance of the old prophets, which he a&s;&s;umed, commanded reverence from the people; and his whole demeanor, being &s;o particularly adapted to the doctrine of repentance which he taught, engaged the attention of the public. Nor is it any wonder, that great notice &s;hould be taken of &s;o remarkable a per&s;on, at a time when the whole nation earne&s;tly expected the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah. And as he preached the nece&s;&s;ity of repentance, becau&s;e the kingdom of heaven was at hand, and had a commi&s;&s;ion from God, to baptize in water, tho&s;e who confe&s;&s;ed their &s;ins, and adhered to his mini&s;try, great numbers of all ranks, &s;ects, and characters, &s;urrounded him in the de&s;ert, and, confe&s;&s;ing their unworthine&s;s and &s;infulne&s;s, were baptized by him in the river Jordan.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="029927_0028_0FE3359C968A8200">JOHN, when he began his mini&s;try did not come to Jeru&s;alem, or the adjacent cities of Judea, but continued about the banks of the noted river Jordan, which, on many accounts, &s;eemed proper to favour the de&s;igns of his preachings; for there had been &s;o many wonderful things tran&s;acted near this &s;acred &s;tream, that it naturally prepared the minds of the people to expect &s;omething extraordinary. Near the banks of this river it was that the prophet Elijah, who was the type of John the Bapti&s;t, was taken in a fiery chariot up to heaven; and what could be more natural, than to &s;ee the great per&s;on, who was the Elias &s;poken of by Malachi, di&s;cover the &s;pirit and power of that great ancient prophet, near the &s;tream which formerly was divided by the &s;troke of his mantle.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance which greatly &s;urpri&s;ed the Bapti&s;t, was the great numbers of Phari&s;ees and Sadducees who attended his mini&s;try, and came to his bapti&s;m. The Phari&s;ees, he knew, pretended to the highe&s;t degree of &s;anctity and holine&s;s of life; and the Saddu|cees believed there would be no future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments. It was there|fore &s;urpri&s;ing, that either of the&s;e parties &s;hould &s;eek after remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, for the former pretended to have no &s;ins that required pardon, and the other nothing to expect after death, as the con&s;equence of them. Nor can we &s;uppo&s;e that John, when he began his mini&s;try, expected to &s;ee the whole nation &s;o much affected with his threatenings as was really the ca&s;e; for he knew that the common people had a great dependance on God's covenant with Abraham, and expected to find favour with the &s;upreme Governor and Judge of the univer&s;e, on that account: to check their daring pre&s;umption, and di&s;courage every hope of divine favour, while they lived ungodly and immoral lives, he addre&s;&s;ed them in this alarming language, <HI>O generation of vipers! who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth fruits therefore worthy of repentance, and begin not to &s;ay we have Abraham to our father: for I &s;ay unto you, that God is able of the&s;e &s;tones to rai&s;e up children to Abraham. And now the axe is laid unto the root of the tree: every tree therefore, which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and ca&s;t into the fire.</HI> The Bapti&s;t thus demoli&s;hed every hope of divine acceptance ari&s;ing from the covenant God made with Abraham; and proclaimed to the world, that the glories of his kingdom would &s;hortly be revealed, and a way of acceptance opened, to which a hearty and &s;incere repentance of &s;in was a nece&s;&s;ary preparative. The awful manner in which this great man pro|nounced the&s;e &s;olemn truths, alarmed and terrified the nation; and a mixt multitude crouded around him, full of anxiety and trouble, inquiring what they &s;hould do. In an&s;wer to this, he informed them, that an hearty and &s;incere repentance of their &s;ins, &s;hould be accompanied with acts of mercy and benevolence. <HI>He that hath two coats,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewi&s;e.</HI> Among&s;t the multitudes which &s;urrounded this wonderful man, were numbers of publicans, who were collectors of the Roman taxes. They were, on that account, odious to the Jews, and had rendered them&s;elves more &s;o, by inju&s;tice and extortion. As theirs was a par|ticular ca&s;e, they applied to him for particular advice, and his an&s;wer was, <HI>Exact no more than that which is appointed you.</HI> Similar to their ca&s;e, was that of the &s;oldiers; who being men trained up to cruelty, &s;laughter, and all the terrors of war, and who&s;e pay was &s;o &s;canty, that they were very apt to plunder for &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; they were exceedingly terrified at the awful vengeance denounced by the prophet; and, with the utmo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and concern, inquired of him what they &s;hould do; to which he replied, <HI>Do violence to no man, neither accu&s;e any fal&s;ely, and be content with your wages.</HI></P>
<P>THE Bapti&s;t commenced his preaching &s;ix months before CHRIST was baptized, and va&s;t multitudes re&s;orted to him from Jeru&s;alem, from other parts of Judea, and even from Galilee, deeply affected with his di&s;cour&s;es, dreading divine vengeance, and confe&s;&s;ing their various vilene&s;s, they were baptized by the holy man in the river Jordan. He was now
<PB N="27" REF="029927_0029_0FE3359F17742298">
generally known and acknowledged for a prophet, and &s;o univer&s;al was his reputation, that we read in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, of &s;ome brethren at Ephe&s;us, and Apollus of Alexandria, who had received the bapti&s;m of John; which proves, that he was re&s;orted to from foreign countries; and the dawn of the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s was &s;een beyond the limits of the land of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>THOUGH John received his bapti&s;m from heaven, we are left in the dark concerning the name or names in which he baptized: the admini&s;tration of that ordinance, in the &s;acred names of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, &s;eems particular to the in&s;titution of it by JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS con&s;tant and unremitting cour&s;e of preaching, delivered with holy vehemence, and the utmo&s;t force of expre&s;&s;ion, accompanied with a manife&s;t innocence of life, and a noble zeal in the cau&s;e of God, which reproved vice and error, however flattered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> however highly exalted, &s;o far prevailed on the people, that they would willingly have per&s;uaded them&s;elves that John was really the Me&s;&s;iah; for it is very probable, that the vi&s;ion which Zacharias had &s;een in the temple, the coming of the Ea&s;tern &s;ages to Jeru|&s;alem, the prophecy of Simeon, the di&s;cour&s;es of Anna, the perplexity of Jeru&s;alem, and the cruelty of Herod, were fre&s;h in the minds of the people, and by them applied to the Bapti&s;t. They were ready to acknowledge him the Redeemer of I&s;rael; and put the que&s;tion plainly to him, <HI>Whether he were the Chri&s;t?</HI> A deputation of prie&s;ts and Levites was &s;ent from Jeru&s;alem, to a&s;k him the que&s;tion in form; to which he abruptly replied, <HI>I am not the Chri&s;t.</HI> They then proceeded to enquire whether he were the prophet Elijah; to which he an&s;wered, <HI>I am not.</HI> They then enquired whether he were one of the an|cient prophets; to which he replied in the negative. Who then art thou, they enquired, and what an&s;wer may we give to them that &s;ent us? <HI>What &s;aye&s;t thou of thy&s;elf?</HI> To which he replied, <HI>I am the voice of one crying in the wilderne&s;s, make &s;traight the way of the Lord, as &s;aid the prophet E&s;aias.</HI> The prie&s;ts and Levites then enquired, why baptize&s;t thou then, if thou be neither CHRIST, nor Elias, nor one of the ancient prophets? to this the Bap|ti&s;t an&s;wered, <HI>I baptize with water, but there &s;tandeth one among you, whom ye know not: he it is, who coming after me, is preferred before me, who&s;e &s;hoes latchet I am not worthy to unloo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">: he &s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with fire; who&s;e fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE John remained at Bethabara, beyond Jordan, our great Redeemer thought pro|per to leave his retirement at Nazareth, and repairing to his forerunner, who was baptiz|ing in the river, he propo&s;ed him&s;elf a candidate for his bapti&s;m. He, who was perfectly pure and holy, could not &s;tand in need of the bapti&s;m of repentance, but being willing to honour the in&s;titution, he offered him&s;elf to John, propo&s;ing to be baptized. John, by a prophetic &s;pirit, knew the <HI>Lamb of God,</HI> acknowledged his &s;uperiority, and would have declined the ta&s;k. <HI>I have need to be baptized of thee, and come&s;t thou to me!</HI> cried the holy man. Je&s;us calmly replied, <HI>Suffer it to be &s;o now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI> Our great Redeemer did not think proper to explain the ca&s;e, and lay down the rea&s;ons why it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to &s;ubmit to that in&s;titution; but, by this reply, gave the Bapti&s;t to under&s;tand, that the divine will required it to be done; it having a tendency to promote the great end for which they both came into the world. The good man's &s;cruples being removed, the Son of God de&s;cended into the &s;tream, and received the &s;acred rite at the hands of the holy prophet. The exalted Redeemer a&s;cending from the water, kneeled down on the banks of Jordan and prayed with great fervency to his heavenly Father. As this holy rite was preparatory to his entering on his public mini&s;try,
<PB N="28" REF="029927_0030_0FE335A0A4E21BB0">
no doubt he prayed for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Spirit, in the great work which lay be|fore him. His prayers were heard: a flood of heavenly glory immediately illuminated the whole concave of the &s;ky, and the Eternal Spirit, arrayed in beamy light, who&s;e whitene&s;s exceeded the new fallen &s;now, appeared in the &s;hape of a dove, hovering over the head of the Saviour of mankind: at the &s;ame time, a voice, awful as the thunders of heaven, yet &s;oft and plea&s;ing as the mo&s;t delightful mu&s;ic, proclaimed to the wondering multitude, <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed.</HI> This manife&s;t te&s;timony from heaven, of the divinity of JESUS, was received with wonder and joy by the Bapti&s;t: <HI>For he that &s;ent him to baptize with water, the &s;ame had &s;aid unto him, upon whom thou &s;halt &s;ee the Spirit de&s;cending, and remaining on him, the &s;ame is he that baptizeth with the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> And, confirmed by this appearance and heavenly voice, beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, he immediately cried out to the a&s;toni&s;hed beholders, <HI>This is he of whom I &s;pake. He that cometh after me, is preferred before me, for he was before me; and of his fullne&s;s have we all received grace for grace: for the law was given by Mo&s;es, but grace and truth came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. No man hath &s;een God at any time: the only begotten Son, which is in the bo&s;om of the Father, he hath declared him.</HI></P>
<P>JOHN continued baptizing and preaching at Bethabara, near the banks of the river Jordan, at which place JESUS came to him, whom when the prophet &s;aw, he cried out, <HI>Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the &s;in of the world;</HI> and on every occa&s;ion and opportunity that offered, the holy man pointed out the Redeemer of I&s;rael, and proclaimed him to mankind.</P>
<P>JOHN, after this, continued preaching and baptizing: his di&s;cour&s;es were delivered with &s;uch freedom and plainne&s;s, and at the &s;ame time with &s;uch energy and &s;pirit, as gave him a commanding influence over the minds of his hearers. Full of the Spirit of God, he regarded not the frowns of the mighty, nor &s;ought the prai&s;es of man. With holy boldne&s;s, impartial freedom of &s;peech, and the high authority of a teacher &s;ent from God, he reproved the vices and mi&s;carriages of all orders of men. He &s;pared not the hypocri&s;y of the Phari&s;ees, the prophanene&s;s of the Sadducees, the extortion of the pub|licans, the rapine of the &s;oldiers, nor the lewdne&s;s and ince&s;t of Herod him&s;elf. That prince, who was tetrarch of Galilee, had taken to wi&s;e a prince&s;s, who&s;e name was He|rodias; &s;he was daughter of Ari&s;tobulus, one of the &s;ons of Herod the Great, by his queen Mariamne. Her father was put to death by the old tyrant, when he was in &s;o much perplexity and di&s;tre&s;s, on account of the troubles and quarrels in his family. This prince&s;s was afterwards married to Herod Philip, tetrarch of Itur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a, her father's bro|ther; &s;he had now eloped from her hu&s;band, and lived with Herod Antipas. This prince was affected with the powerful plainne&s;s, and authoritative &s;implicity of the preaching of the Bapti&s;t, and frequently attended on his mini&s;try. The prophet, as he &s;pared no vice, nor man who was guilty of it, however e&s;teemed or exalted, warmly expo&s;tulated with him on the wickedne&s;s and lewdne&s;s of his life, and &s;harply reproved him for his ince&s;tuous marriage. The haughty queen was &s;o offended at the boldne&s;s of the prophet, that &s;he demanded his death. The king would have complied with her reque&s;t, but was afraid of an in&s;urrection among&s;t the people; for John was highly e&s;teemed and reverenced by all men: Herod therefore endeavoured to gratify her revenge, by ca&s;ting the Bapti&s;t into pri&s;on. Here the holy man remained &s;everal months, and his public mini&s;try cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>WHILE he was thus in confinement, he heard of the miracles which JESUS daily wrought, and his public mini&s;try and preaching. But our Redeemer not having taken &s;uch &s;teps as the Jewi&s;h nation expected from the Me&s;&s;iah (for the prevailing notion was, that this great per&s;on, whenever he appeared, would &s;et up a temporal kingdom, and
<PB N="29" REF="029927_0031_0FE335A2298C0C20">
reign over all the earth) the Bapti&s;t &s;eemed not to be thoroughly &s;atisfied with his pro|ceeding. His chu&s;ing a company of illiterate fi&s;hermen to be his di&s;ciples, and avoiding all popularity and applau&s;e, &s;eemed not to promi&s;e the ri&s;ing of his kingdom. The good man therefore &s;ent two of his di&s;ciples to the Son of God, to enquire into the meaning of the&s;e things, not directly, but rather &s;eeming to he&s;itate whether he were the Me&s;&s;iah or not: <HI>Art thou he that &s;hould come, or look we for another?</HI> It happened when the&s;e di&s;ciples came to our Lord, he was employed in publi&s;hing his go&s;pel, healing the &s;ick, ca&s;ting out devils, and re&s;toring &s;ight to the blind. He did not therefore think fit to return a direct an&s;wer to the que&s;tion of John, but referred him to the works he performed, and the miracles he wrought: <HI>Go and tell John,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>what things you have &s;een and heard; how that the blind &s;ee, the lame walk, the lepers are clean&s;ed, the deaf hear, the dead are rai&s;ed, and the poor have the go&s;pel preached unto them.</HI></P>
<P>JOHN continued long in pri&s;on, and was mortally hated by the ince&s;tuous queen: but it was not in the power of the enraged prince&s;s to procure his death. At length an opportunity offered, and the prophet fell a victim to her vengeance. Herod the tetrarch of Galilee, with whom &s;he lived in adultery and ince&s;t, made a great fea&s;t for the cele|brating his birth-day, to which he invited his courtiers, the chief officers of his army, and the nobles and great men of the country. At this entertainment a young dam&s;el, named Salome, the daughter of the queen Herodias, by her former hu&s;band Philip, entertained the noble company, and dignified the royal fea&s;t by her &s;kill and graceful dexterity in dancing. This gave &s;o much &s;atisfaction and plea&s;ure to the company, e&s;pecially to the king, that he promi&s;ed, with an oath, to give her whatever &s;he de&s;ired; and a&s;&s;ured her, that her reque&s;t &s;hould not be denied, were it for half of his kingdom. The young dam&s;el was not willing to make &s;o important a demand without the advice of her mother. The enraged prince&s;s, having now an opportunity to accompli&s;h her revenge on the prophet, to whom &s;he bore a mortal hatred, commanded her daughter to demand the head of John the Bapti&s;t. This reque&s;t the dam&s;el &s;oon pre&s;ented at the throne. The king, as he little expected &s;uch a demand, was very much concerned; yet, as he had given his oath, and was not willing to &s;eem little in the eyes of his gue&s;ts, he gave imme|diate orders that John &s;hould be beheaded in private, in the ca&s;tle where he was confined. The orders were immediately executed, and the bloody head of the prophet was brought into the banqueting room, and given to the dam&s;el. She took the cruel pre&s;ent to her mother, who beheld, with much &s;atisfaction, the full gratification of her great revenge. Thus fell this great and illu&s;trious per&s;on. His di&s;ciples hearing of his death, came to Herod, and begged the body of their ma&s;ter: they buried it in a decent &s;epulchre, and knowing that John had always e&s;teemed JESUS to be the Me&s;&s;iah, they came and informed him of this mournful event.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, having been baptized in the river Jordan, and having received the te&s;timony of God, in the mo&s;t manife&s;t and glorious manner, amid&s;t va&s;t numbers of &s;pectators, declaring him to be the Son of the mo&s;t High, now prepared to begin his public mini&s;try, and enter upon the great work for which he came into the world.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="029927_0032_0FE335ADE490EA88">JORDAN, in which our great Redeemer was baptized, was the mo&s;t con&s;iderable river in the land of Canaan, and ran almo&s;t from the northern to the &s;outhern boundaries of the Holy Land. It ran a great way through the wilderne&s;s of Judea, which was not called a wilderne&s;s becau&s;e it was quite uninhabited, but becau&s;e it was more wild, uncultivated, and le&s;s inhabited than the re&s;t of the country. The river Jordan, like the Nile, over|flowed its banks at one &s;ea&s;on of the year: it was much infe&s;ted with lions, and other wild bea&s;ts, who, being driven out of their dens by the ri&s;ing of the waters, &s;pread them&s;elves over the country; hence the allu&s;ion in the prophet, he comes <HI>like a lion from the &s;wellings of Jordan.</HI></P>
<P>THE exalted Saviour of mankind, when he began his public mini&s;try, did not &s;eek to aggrandize him&s;elf, or court the honour or applau&s;e of men. It might have been ex|pected, that, preceeded by his forerunner the Bapti&s;t, and with a blaze of divine glory round his head, he would have went to Jeru&s;alem, the &s;eat of power, and made known him&s;elf and his preten&s;ions, to the great men of the kingdom. But the meek and lowly JESUS, &s;hunning every thing that was grand and noble, retired to the de&s;art. The evan|geli&s;t Mark informs us, that he was driven of the Spirit into the wilderne&s;s: it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he was driven by any irre&s;i&s;tible power, but by the influence of that Holy Spirit which de&s;cended on him at his bapti&s;m, and always re&s;ided in him. The de|&s;ign of this retirement, no doubt, was, that by &s;olitude, contemplation, and &s;piritual con|ver&s;e with his heavenly Father, he might prepare him&s;elf for the great work which lay before him; and by baffling the temptations of the evil &s;pirit, might triumph over the grand enemy of mankind in our &s;tead, and point out to us the duty of with&s;tanding his temptations. <HI>It behoved him in all things to be like to his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high-prie&s;t: for in that he hath &s;uffered being tempted, he is able to &s;uccour them that are tempted.</HI> That part of the wilderne&s;s into which the holy JESUS retired, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be about four miles from the river Jordan, and twenty from Jeru&s;alem. It was in every re&s;pect, a di&s;mal and uncomfortable &s;ituation, dry, barren, and wa&s;te, &s;urrounded by va&s;t craggy mountains, frequented by wild bea&s;ts, &s;olitary, dreary, and forlorn.</P>
<P>IN this dreadful retreat, our great Redeemer remained forty days (the &s;ame time which Mo&s;es was in the Mount, when he received the law) amid&s;t the howlings of bea&s;ts of prey, and the con&s;tant temptations of wicked &s;pirits, who, no doubt, u&s;ed all their arts to interrupt his meditations and di&s;turb his peace. The de&s;art was barren and dry, it produced nothing to eat; nor was there any water to allay the thir&s;t. The Son of God fa&s;ted forty days, being &s;upported by divine power; at the end of which time, he felt the calls of nature, and the painful &s;en&s;ations of hunger and thir&s;t. What our Lord &s;uf|fered from the temptations and delu&s;ive arts of the wicked &s;pirits, during his forty days abode in the de&s;art, is not particularly recorded; but it &s;eems at the end of that time, he was attacked by the prince of apo&s;tate angels him&s;elf. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed but a &s;pirit, &s;o &s;ubtle and vigilant, mu&s;t be fully acquainted with the late manife&s;tation of divine glory, which had, at Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m, declared him the Son of God; nor could he be ignorant of the circum&s;tance attending his birth, and the various te&s;timonies of his life. But the great adver&s;ary of mankind, though he mu&s;t certainly be convinced that he was an extraordinary per&s;on, &s;eems not to be fully &s;atisfied, that he was the Son of God; and to prove this important point, took this opportunity when he was afflicted with hunger and thir&s;t, to ply him with his temptations. The wily tempter approached the holy JESUS, very likely in human &s;hape, and, knowing the extremity of his hunger, expo&s;|tulated with him, why he would endure &s;uch hard&s;hips, when it was in his power, &s;o ea&s;ily to find relief. <HI>If thou be the Son of God,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>command that the&s;e &s;tones be made bread.</HI> This temptation, &s;eeming &s;o kind and harmle&s;s, was the more dangerous: the crafty

fiend de&s;igning to allure our great Redeemer to &s;ome &s;uperfluous acts of his divine power, to &s;upply his pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, which might have been contrary to an entire re&s;ignation and obedience to the will of his heavenly Father: but our Lord repelled this in&s;inuating temptation, by quoting the words of Mo&s;es, which implied, that God, when he plea&s;es, can, by extraordinary means, &s;upply the wants of his creatures, and provide food for the &s;upport of the human race. <HI>Man &s;hall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</HI></P>
<P>THE crafty fiend, repul&s;ed in his fir&s;t open attempt on the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, proceeded to a &s;econd trial to en&s;nare our exalted Saviour; in order to which, it is a&s;&s;erted by the evangeli&s;t, <HI>that he took him to the holy city, and &s;et him upon the pinnacle of the temple.</HI> Our great Redeemer mu&s;t be hurried through air to the di&s;tance of twenty miles: it is &s;up|po&s;ed he was &s;et upon &s;ome &s;pire on the &s;outh &s;ide of the temple; probably on that part which was called Herod's tower, which was built upon the edge of a rock, under which was a valley of prodigious depth. Jo&s;ephus writes, that he that was on the top of this tower, and looked down to the valley beneath, his head would immediately &s;wim, and grow dizzy! nay, it was farther than his very eyes could reach the bottom. At this giddy height, the crafty tempter &s;et the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, and thus addre&s;&s;ed him: <HI>If thou be the Son of God, ca&s;t thy&s;elf down: for it is written, He &s;hall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands &s;hall they bear thee up, le&s;t at any time thou da&s;h thy foot again&s;t a &s;tone.</HI> Thus, by a partial and mutilated quotation from the P&s;alms, the great adver&s;ary of man|kind attempted to draw a&s;ide and overcome their only Saviour; the words, <HI>to keep thee in all thy ways,</HI> were not to the artful tempter's purpo&s;e, and therefore were craftily omitted. The tendency of this temptation &s;eems to be the exciting our Lord to pre&s;ume too much upon the divine protection, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate of humility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and as he de|pended on the word of God, when he was in danger of being fami&s;hed in the wilder|ne&s;s, the tempter quoted the &s;ame word to a&s;&s;ure him, that God would &s;end his angels to pre&s;erve him, though he &s;hould leap from that &s;tupendous height. And, perhaps, the malicious fiend might &s;ecretly hope, that, if the Lord could be prevailed upon to make the experiment, he would be da&s;hed to pieces with the fall, and all the apprehen&s;ions of the infernal powers, on his account, would then have been at an end. But the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS was not thus to be overcome: he &s;tood fixed on the immovable ba&s;is of humility and meekne&s;s, and replied to the in&s;inuating tempter, in the words of Mo&s;es, <HI>It is written again,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>thou &s;halt not tempt the Lord thy God.</HI> By which we are to learn, that it is not lawful to try the goodne&s;s of God, or the reality of his paternal care in our pre&s;ervation, by putting our&s;elves into unnece&s;&s;ary danger, or making wild and extrava|gant experiments of his protection.</P>
<P>THE grand adver&s;ary of mankind, though twice repul&s;ed with &s;hame, yet &s;corned to give up the conte&s;t; but rallying all his powers of deception, &s;tood prepared to make one more bold effort. The evangeli&s;t informs us, that from the pinnacle of the temple, the devil took our Lord <HI>to the top of an exceeding high mountain, and &s;hewed him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them.</HI> The crafty deceiver here thought to work upon our Saviour's ambition; and, doubtle&s;s, by the powers of bold inchantment, he filled the wide-&s;tretched land&s;cape with va&s;t palaces, cities, temples, towers, fleets, and armies, chariots, warriors, foaming &s;teeds, and all the mighty powers of &s;overeign great|ne&s;s: which pointing in order to our Redeemer's view, <HI>all the&s;e things,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and wor&s;hip me.</HI> To this boldne&s;s and bla&s;phemy, the holy JESUS gave a &s;harper rebuke than he had done to the other temptations, and plainly manife&s;ting his divinity, while he a&s;&s;umed a commanding authority, worthy the Son of God, <HI>Get thee hence Satan,</HI> he cried, <HI>for it is written, thou &s;halt wor&s;hip the Lord thy God, and him only &s;halt thou &s;erve.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CHRIST</HI> begins his Public Mini&s;try. His fir&s;t Miracle at Cana. He goes to Jeru&s;alem, at the Pa&s;&s;over; performs &s;everal Miracles; clears the Temple of the Traders; and holds a Con|ference with Nicodemus.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was during the retreat of our great Redeemer into the de&s;ert, and his abode there, that the Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim &s;ent the deputation of prie&s;ts and Levites to John the Bap|ti&s;t, as before related; and he having openly and hone&s;tly informed them, that he was not the Me&s;&s;iah, they returned to Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>THE next day after their departure, the Son of God, having defeated the cunning, and di&s;appointed the wiles of the great enemy of mankind, returned from the wilderne&s;s, af|ter an abode there of forty days, and came to Bethabara, where John was baptizing. The holy Bapti&s;t, knowing that the great de&s;ign of his coming into the world, was to pre|pare the way for, and lead the people to the Me&s;&s;iah; no &s;ooner &s;aw the exalted Saviour of mankind, than he pointed him out to the people as the object of their highe&s;t regard and reverence: <HI>Behold,</HI> he cried, <HI>the Lamb of God, which taketh away the &s;in of the world!</HI> And that it might not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he declared him to be &s;uch a dignified per&s;on, without &s;ufficient grounds, he proceeded to inform the attentive multitude, that he had received a full a&s;&s;urance of this truth at the time when he baptized him, by the appearance of the Holy Spirit, in the &s;hape of a dove, vi&s;ibly re&s;ting on his head, <HI>John bare record, &s;aying, I &s;aw the Spirit de&s;cending like a dove, and it abode upon him, and I knew him not; but he that &s;ent me to baptize with water, the &s;ame &s;aid unto me, upon whom thou &s;halt &s;ee the Spirit de&s;cending and remaining on him, the &s;ame is he that baptizeth with the Holy Gho&s;t; and I &s;aw and bare record, that this is the Son of God.</HI> After this public decla|ration of his great forerunner, JESUS departed; but returning the next day to the banks of Jordan, the Bapti&s;t being there with two of his di&s;ciples, he no &s;ooner beheld the holy JESUS, than he repeated and confirmed his former declaration, which was made to the multitude, <HI>Behold the Lamb of God.</HI> It is probable the&s;e di&s;ciples were ab&s;ent when JESUS was baptized, and the Spirit de&s;cended on him, while a voice from heaven declared him the Son of God. This plain and po&s;itive declaration of their ma&s;ter, excited their curio&s;ity, and filled them with a &s;trong de&s;ire to be further informed. To this end, they followed JESUS, no doubt de&s;iring to be acquainted with this extraordinary per&s;on. Our great Redeemer, knowing their intentions, turned towards them, and, with that conde&s;cending kindne&s;s and complacency &s;o natural to him, took them with him to his hou&s;e. We are informed, by the evangeli&s;t John, that one of the&s;e di&s;ciples was An|drew,
<PB N="33" REF="029927_0035_0FE335B2A64178E8">
the brother of Simon Peter; the name of the other is not mentioned, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e it was the evangeli&s;t him&s;elf. They, by this invitation, gained an opportunity of con|ver&s;ing with the Saviour of mankind, and that conver&s;ation, joined with the declaration of their ma&s;ter, the Bapti&s;t, fully convinced them of the truth of his mi&s;&s;ion, and they e&s;teemed and reverenced him as the great Me&s;&s;iah, the long-expected Redeemer of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>SOON after this, Andrew found his brother Peter, and with the utmo&s;t joy and eleva|tion of heart, brought him to JESUS. The Lord immediately called him by his name, and informed him, that he &s;hould hereafter be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, a &s;tone, or rock. The day following, Philip, an inhabitant of the town of Beth&s;aida, was &s;o happy as to come in company with the great Redeemer; JESUS commanded him to follow him, which that di&s;ciple immediately obeyed: perhaps he might not be unac|quainted with the character of the Son of God; or if he was, the call of the great Sa|viour of &s;inners was accompanied with &s;uch manife&s;tations of divine power, that he gladly obeyed.</P>
<P>SOON after this, Philip came in company with Nathaniel, an inhabitant of the town of Cana in Galilee: Nathaniel is thought by &s;ome to be the &s;ame per&s;on who was after|wards called Bartholomew. Philip told him, that they had found the Me&s;&s;iah, that great per&s;on foretold by Mo&s;es and the prophets; and that his name was JESUS <HI>of Na|zareth, the Son of Jo&s;eph.</HI> Nathaniel well knew that, according to the ancient prophecies, the Me&s;&s;iah was to be born at Bethlehem: and that he was to belong to the family of David; and as Nazareth was a very low and vulger place, he could not believe that &s;o exalted a per&s;on &s;hould dwell in &s;uch a contemptible city, and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e, by inquiring, <HI>can any good thing come out of Nazareth!</HI> In an&s;wer to this, Philip referred him to the per&s;on he had mentioned, and de&s;ired him to go with him, and &s;ee whether what he had reported was not evident from the plain marks of &s;uperior greatne&s;s and divinity which appeared in this extraordinary man. Nathaniel, however mean and de&s;picable his opinion of Nazareth might be, would not give way to his prejudice &s;o much, as to be prevented from embracing &s;o happy an opportunity, and therefore accompanied by Philip, went to vi&s;it the Saviour of I&s;rael. His ingenuous and candid di&s;po&s;ition, would not permit him to reject the preten&s;ions of JESUS without examination and trial; and, being introduced by his friend, and pre&s;ented to the Lord, the &s;tranger immediately heard his heavenly lips pronounce this honourable character, applied by our great Re|deemer to Nathaniel; <HI>Behold, an I&s;raelite indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n whom is no guile.</HI> The good man was very much &s;urpri&s;ed to hear a per&s;on he had never &s;een before, addre&s;s him in this man|ner, and for his &s;atisfaction in this my&s;terious point, inquired of our Redeemer, how he came to know him &s;o well, as to be able to give &s;uch a de&s;cription of his character? JE|SUS, with a conde&s;cending &s;mile replied, that, before Philip called him, he &s;aw him under the fig-tree. It is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that Nathaniel had been under the fig-tree, at his private devotions; and doubtle&s;s, had expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch &s;entiments, in the effu&s;ions of his pious heart, as entitled him to the noble character which our Redeemer had given him; and it is plain that he perceived, from CHRIST's an&s;wer to his inquiry, that he knew what was done, where he was not pre&s;ent, and was fully acquainted with the thoughts of the heart; therefore, with the fulle&s;t conviction of mind, and the utmo&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;e and joy, he cried out, <HI>Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of I&s;rael.</HI> Our Redeemer, approving his faith, proceeded to inform him, that he &s;hould hereafter &s;ee fuller and clearer proofs of his divinity; <HI>Becau&s;e I &s;aid, I &s;aw thee under the fig-tree, believe&s;t thou? Thou &s;halt &s;ee greater things than the&s;e. I &s;ay unto you, hereafter ye &s;hall &s;ee heaven open, and the angels of God a&s;cending and de&s;cending upon the Son of Man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="029927_0036_0FE335BD2ACAE520">OUR Lord having thus given manife&s;t proofs of his divinity, and called five di&s;ciples, was the third day after, with his mother and them, invited to a marriage fea&s;t at Cana, a &s;mall town, not far di&s;tant from Nazareth. His mother, it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, was either a relation, or intimate friend of the married pair; and it happened, at the &s;upper, that they were &s;carce of wine: &s;he had often, no doubt, been witne&s;s of the &s;u|pernatural power that attended her &s;on, and as &s;he would willingly have every thing &s;o conducted, that there might be no reproach fall on her new-married friends, &s;he applied to him, perhaps, expecting that he would work a miracle for their &s;upply. JESUS, upon receiving the information from his mother, replied, with a kind of gentle rebuke, <HI>Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come:</HI> intimating by this, that the time for his working miracles in Galilee was not yet approached, but his bu&s;ine&s;s lay in other parts of the kingdom. His mother does not &s;eem by this reply, to have given up her hopes of his doing &s;omething for her friends in this nece&s;&s;ity; and, therefore, &s;he ordered the &s;er|vants punctually to perform whatever he commanded: nor was &s;he mi&s;taken in her &s;uppo|&s;ition; for our Lord kindly conde&s;cended, by his miraculous power, to relieve his friends, and to convince his new di&s;ciples of the divinity of their ma&s;ter. He ordered the &s;er|vants to fill &s;ix water-pots, each containing about twenty gallons, with water; the &s;er|vants obeyed, and filled them up to the brim. The whole, in a moment, was changed into the mo&s;t excellent wine; <HI>Bear,</HI> &s;aid our exalted Redeemer, <HI>to the governor of the fea&s;t</HI>: the governor, ignorant of the miracle, and highly plea&s;ed with the delicious flavour and richne&s;s of the wine, which was much &s;uperiour to what they had drank before, applied to the bridegroom, and, in the hearing of the company, informed him, that he had acted contrary to the common cu&s;tom of fea&s;ts. <HI>Every man at the beginning,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>doth &s;et forth good wine; and, when men have well drank, then that which is wor&s;e; but thou ha&s;t kept the good wine until now.</HI> The bridegroom, doubtle&s;s, was much &s;urpri&s;ed at this account, and upon inquiry, found that this excellent wine was produced by JESUS, in a miraculous manner. This miracle was the fir&s;t which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour performed; by it he ho|noured the in&s;titution of marriage, convinced his di&s;ciples that he, in reality, was the Son of God, and the Saviour of I&s;rael, and &s;pread his fame over all the country around.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the enemies of our religion, who diligently watch for every opportunity to ca&s;t contempt on the great Author of it, have pre&s;umed to cen&s;ure and ridicule this fir&s;t miracle of our Lord. They repre&s;ent the affair, as though the evangeli&s;t had reported our Saviour to have miraculou&s;ly produced this wine, after the company had plentifully drank, and hence would in&s;inuate, that he was a friend to drunk|enne&s;s. They might, however, have &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed their mirth, if they had con&s;idered that the words of the governor of the fea&s;t, before quoted, do not imply that any of the company were intoxicated, but only that it was the cu&s;tom at &s;uch fea&s;ts, to bring the be&s;t wine fir&s;t. Be&s;ides, our &s;elf-conceited and impudent cavillers, might have given them&s;elves time to con&s;ider, that, though the Jewi&s;h marriage-fea&s;ts la&s;ted &s;even days, our Lord did not order all this wine, which he miraculou&s;ly produced, to be drank at that &s;olemnity: nor is there one circum&s;tance in the account of this fea&s;t, which gives the lea&s;t intimation that any of the company were intoxicated; and it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that, when they had di&s;covered the miracle, they would have &s;o much reverence for the divinity of the per|&s;on of our Lord, as would prevent them from making &s;uch bad u&s;e of his wine, e&s;pe|cially in his pre&s;ence. Nor can it be inferred, from the quantity of wine which our Lord thus miraculou&s;ly produced, that he would connive at intemperance, and furni&s;h the means of exce&s;s: it rather ought to be concluded, that, by this miracle, he intended to make a &s;ea&s;onable and valuable pre&s;ent to his friends, which might &s;erve for their u&s;e, when the &s;olemnity of the fea&s;t was over. And, it may further be ob&s;erved, that by converting &s;o large a quantity of water into wine, our Lord prevented all objections that

might have been rai&s;ed again&s;t the miracle being true; for a &s;mall quantity of wine might have been ea&s;ily procured to carry on the deception, when &s;o large a quantity could not: &s;o that, if it be admitted that the&s;e water-pots were ever &s;o large, there can be no objec|tion rai&s;ed again&s;t the de&s;ign of the miracle; nor can it be charged with giving indul|gence to intemperance, any more than the plenty which the all-bountiful Creator &s;how|ers upon the vineyard and the field: &s;o that, notwith&s;tanding the objections and cavils which may ari&s;e from fal&s;e wi&s;dom, this fir&s;t miracle of our Lord appears to be, in every re&s;pect, worthy of God, and beneficial to man.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;over, an annual fea&s;t of the Jews, kept in commemoration of their pre&s;erva|tion, when the Egyptian fir&s;t-born were &s;lain by a &s;troke from heaven, being at hand, and our Lord de&s;igning to be pre&s;ent at the fea&s;t, he departed from Cana, and taking Caper|naum in his way, he went to Jeru&s;alem. He no &s;ooner arrived at the chief city of the Jews, but he went to the temple, and probably it being the eve of the fea&s;t, he found the &s;acred apartments full of traders, money-changers, and merchants, who &s;old &s;uch things as would be wanted at the en&s;uing fe&s;tival. The holy JESUS was filled with indigna|tion, to &s;ee the holy place thus prophaned; and immediately applied him&s;elf to cor|rect the abu&s;e: accordingly, he made a &s;mall whip, or &s;courge, and a&s;&s;uming the air and fervency of the ancient prophets, he drove this mercenary train out of the temple; awed by his maje&s;tic all-commanding appearance, they ran before him in a tumult: the oxen and &s;heep afrighted, fled, and the owners after them, overthrowing the tables of the money-changers, and pouring out their money upon the ground, none daring to make re&s;i&s;tance: the &s;ellers of doves he al&s;o urged to depart, commanding them all for the future, to take care how they made the temple of God an hou&s;e of merchandi&s;e. The Jews perceiving a promi&s;cuous throng of people and cattle driving out of the temple in the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment and terror, and afterwards finding that JESUS had put them all into this hurry and confu&s;ion, by commanding them to depart from the temple, and had drove them before him; they probably &s;ummoned a council, and demanded of him in form, by what authority he did this; at the &s;ame time, requiring him to give them a &s;ign, which &s;hould prove that he did it by a divine commi&s;&s;ion. Our Lord, on this oc|ca&s;ion, only referred them to the miracle of his own re&s;urrection, <HI>De&s;troy,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>this body, and I will rai&s;e it up in three days.</HI> The rulers of the Jews, mi&s;taking his meaning, concluded his words had reference to the noble and magnificent temple built by Herod, and were very much &s;urpri&s;ed at the a&s;&s;ertion; <HI>Forty and &s;ix years,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</HI> But though this an&s;wer of our Lord co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|founded the great men among&s;t the Jews; the di&s;ciples of JESUS remembered a pa&s;&s;age in the P&s;alms, which was clearly applicable to this part of our Redeemer's conduct, <HI>The zeal of thine hou&s;e has eaten me up.</HI> And, as this prediction of our Lord was delivered in the &s;tyle of the ancient prophets, who&s;e prophecies were &s;ometimes not under&s;tood till they were fulfilled; this &s;aying of their ma&s;ter came fre&s;h into their minds, after his re|&s;urrection, and confirmed them in their belief of the truth.</P>
<P>THOUGH the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS refu&s;ed to work any miracles in the pre&s;ence of the rulers of the Jews, and &s;trove not to make him&s;elf known to the great and mighty in Jeru&s;a|lem; ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, at this time, he wrought &s;everal wonderful works among&s;t the common peo|ple, and, by exerting the mighty power inve&s;ted in him, confirmed the truth of the doctrines he taught, and proved that he was a teacher &s;ent from God, and that great per&s;on &s;o long expected to be the Redeemer of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>OUR Lord continued performing &s;everal wonders among&s;t the common people, during the time of the pa&s;&s;over, and many of them believed on him; for they were fully con|vinced
<PB N="36" REF="029927_0039_0FE335C2A7F9E300">
of his divine mi&s;&s;ion, by the miracles which they &s;aw him perform. But JESUS knowing the &s;ecret of men's hearts, and not wanting any information concerning them, he was able to form a ju&s;t conception of the nature of this belief; and knew how un|likely it was to &s;tand the day of trial, on account of the weakne&s;s and ficklene&s;s of man|kind. In con&s;equence of this knowledge, he did not think it proper to run the hazard of the incon&s;tancy of the multitude, or tru&s;t him&s;elf too much in their hands: for this rea&s;on, he avoided conver&s;ing too freely with them, or making more full and clear di&s;|coveries of his divinity, and the end of his coming into the world; for he knew how likely it was, that great numbers &s;hould de&s;ert his cau&s;e, when he came to be publicly oppo&s;ed to the great Sanhedrim, by the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, the chief prie&s;ts and elders, and all the great men of the nation.</P>
<P>BUT the wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment excited by the miracles which JESUS had performed, were not confined to the common people: the wide &s;preading report had reached the ears of Nicodemus, a man of great eminence among&s;t the Jews; he was one of the great Sanhedrim, and in great honour and e&s;teem at Jeru&s;alem. He had heard the ac|count of the miracles which JESUS had wrought, and he believed it, and being a per&s;on of an ingenious, inqui&s;itive mind, he wanted to be further informed.</P>
<P>IT is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he was not ignorant of the general expectation of the Jewi&s;h kingdom, re&s;pecting the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah: and he ardently wi&s;hed to &s;ee the accompli&s;hment of the ancient prophecies, in the appearance of that great per&s;on. And, as the general opinion was, that the Me&s;&s;iah, when he came, would &s;et up a temporal kingdom, and exalt the Jewi&s;h nation over all the kingdoms on the earth, it is to be &s;up|po&s;ed that the great men among&s;t the Jews, as well as the common people, &s;trongly de|&s;ired the approach of this happy event.</P>
<P>NICODEMUS was convinced by the miracles which JESUS performed, &s;o wonderful in their nature, &s;o &s;alutary in their effects, &s;o worthy the character of the Son of God, &s;o kind and advantageous to man, &s;o happily adapted to the confirmation of the doctrines he taught, &s;o perfectly agreeable to the attributes of God, and conformable to the pre|dictions of the ancient prophets concerning the Me&s;&s;iah, that the&s;e mighty works mu&s;t proceed from a divine original, and that no power le&s;s than Omnipotence could produce them. But very likely &s;ome con&s;iderable &s;cruples might ari&s;e in the mind of this ruler in I&s;rael, when he con&s;idered the ob&s;curity of the birth, and the meanne&s;s of the appearance of the per&s;on who performed the&s;e wonderful works. This, in every re&s;pect, being &s;o contrary to that magnificence and grandeur in which the Jewi&s;h nation expected the Me&s;&s;iah, to appear, might cau&s;e great &s;cruples to ari&s;e in the mind of Nicodemus, and fill his &s;oul with perplexity and doubt: but he being a per&s;on of judgment and di&s;cern|ment, as well as probity and honour, would not &s;uffer his prejudices to prevent him from fairly and impartially inquiring after truth, in an affair of &s;uch importance, and therefore determined to have an interview with JESUS him&s;elf. He did not think it ad|vi&s;able to wait on our Lord in public; for he thought he might be reproached by the rulers and great men among&s;t the Jews, and therefore concluded to make this vi&s;it in private; and that it might be the more &s;o, he cho&s;e to make it in the night.</P>
<P>HE acco&s;ted our Redeemer with a confe&s;&s;ion of his conviction of the truth and reality of the miracles he had performed; and that they could not be produced by inchant|ment, or any infernal a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but the nature of them proved them to be produced by the mighty power of God, and confirmed the doctrines JESUS taught to be divine: <HI>Rabbi,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no man can do tho&s;e mi|racles that thou do&s;t, except God be with him.</HI> It does not by this &s;alutation appear, that
<PB N="37" REF="029927_0040_0FE335CC6B914260">
Nicodemus was convinced that JESUS was the Me&s;&s;iah; that was the point which he wanted to be more fully demon&s;trated, and hoped, by this interview, to receive &s;ome &s;atisfaction concerning it. Our Lord did not think proper to &s;atisfy the &s;cruples of this ruler of I&s;rael concerning this, but took the opportunity to in&s;truct him in a matter of greater importance, and lead him into an acquaintance with the nature of his religion: in order to this, he began with introducing the fir&s;t great doctrine of the go&s;pel, re|&s;pecting its operations on the mind of man; <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> Our Saviour, by the&s;e remarkable words, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to inform the ruler of I&s;rael, that though the lu&s;tre of his miracles had forced him to acknowledge, that he had received his commi&s;&s;ion from on high, yet he could not di&s;cern, that he really was the Me&s;&s;iah, nor under&s;tand the &s;piritual nature of his kingdom, without the operation of a &s;upernatural power, which mu&s;t produce &s;uch a change in his &s;oul, as might fitly be de&s;cribed by being born again. Nicodemus, being an utter &s;tranger to this doctrine, and thinking our Lord's words had no figurative allu&s;ion, but had reference to a natural birth, was very much &s;urpri&s;ed at the a&s;&s;ertion; for he could not imagine that the &s;eed of Abraham &s;tood in need of any &s;econd birth, to render them the children of God, and the heirs of his kingdom; and therefore ha&s;tily and earne&s;tly inquired, <HI>How can a man be born when he is old; can he enter a &s;e|cond time into his mother's womb, and be born?</HI> Our Lord then proceeded to inform him, that his words had not a natural, but a &s;piritual meaning, <HI>Except a man be born of water and the Spirit,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> Nicodemus might learn, from the&s;e words, that his apprehen&s;ions were gro&s;s and wide from the purpo&s;e; for if it were po&s;&s;ible for a man to be born a &s;econd time of his earthly parent, he would not thereby become &s;o holy and pure, as would render him &s;it for the kingdom of God; but the birth our Redeemer had reference to, was of a &s;piritual nature, which, by producing that faith which have a lively and powerful influence on the heart and life, might prepare the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it for the divine acceptance: <HI>That which is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h; and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</HI> Whatever is born of woman, partakes of the imperfec|tions and &s;infulne&s;s of human nature; but that which is born of the Spirit, is pure and holy, and prevails over tho&s;e things which render mankind unfit to be partakers of the kingdom of God, by implanting a new and powerful principle of action, and working an entire renovation in the &s;oul, which may very fitly be compared to a new birth. Nicode|mus, &s;till continuing full of he&s;itation and &s;urpri&s;e, our Lord proceeded to inform him, that the thing would not appear &s;o my&s;terious, when rightly under&s;tood, as his prejudices in|duced him to think it was, but might, as to the probability of it, be illu&s;trated by a familiar &s;imile; <HI>Marvel not,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that I &s;aid unto thee, ye mu&s;t be born again. The wind bloweth where it li&s;teth, and thou heare&s;t the &s;ound thereof, but can&s;t not tell from whence it cometh or whi|ther it goeth; &s;o is every one that is born of the Spirit:</HI> The meaning of the&s;e words &s;eems to be, that, though the entire renovation of heart, which Chri&s;t's religion required, might &s;eem impo&s;&s;ible to the blind eyes of carnal men, it might neverthele&s;s be true: for in the natural world, there are many things of &s;o fine a texture, that we cannot di&s;cern them with our eyes, but it is very manife&s;t that they exi&s;t, and they are very great and powerful in their effects. The wind is a thing altogether invi&s;ible, no man can behold its body or trace its motion, even when it blows with the greate&s;t violence; yet that there is &s;uch a thing is &s;ufficiently evident, and the effects of it are univer&s;ally known: thus, therefore, that regeneration, or renovation which is wrought in the heart of man, by the powerful agency of the Spirit of God, though, in it&s;elf, it be invi&s;ible, and not at all di&s;cernible by the &s;ight or &s;en&s;e; yet, in its effects, it is a great and plain thing, and really as great and manife&s;t a change in the nature and di&s;po&s;ition, the de&s;ires and pur&s;uits of the &s;oul, and conducing as much to all the purpo&s;es of divine and eternal life, as the birth of man does to this mortal life.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="029927_0041_0FE335CDEEDF4098">THOUGH the&s;e arguments were plain, and not to be evaded or denied, yet, Nicodemus retained his prejudices; this &s;y&s;tem of &s;piritual religion was contrary to his apprehen&s;ions, nor could he &s;ee how the children of Abraham could &s;tand in need of a renovation and change, equal to that which the infant finds, when born, to fit them for the kingdom of God; and therefore, the ruler of I&s;rael inquired, <HI>How can the&s;e things be?</HI> To which our great Redeemer replied, that it was &s;trange he &s;hould be &s;o hard to be in&s;tructed, <HI>Art thou a ma&s;ter in I&s;rael, and knowe&s;t not the&s;e things?</HI> Art thou a teacher of others, and yet unable to di&s;cern things which I have &s;o plainly revealed? Our Lord then proceeded to inform him that he was certain of the truth of what he had advanced concerning the new birth, and therefore it ought to be received; but if the&s;e plain and ea&s;y truths, relating to the &s;piritual nature of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, were &s;o &s;lowly received by men of the fir&s;t eminence and under&s;tanding in the nation, how would they be able to comprehend the more &s;ublime and noble doctrines of the go&s;pel, which he was come to preach to the &s;ons of men. Our Redeemer further proceeded to inform Nicodemus, that it was the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of mankind to attend to his mini&s;try, becau&s;e he came with &s;uperior credentials, and higher authority than ever man had before him. Mo&s;es had never a&s;cended into heaven, but re|ceived his law from the top of mount Sinai: none of the ancient prophets had de&s;cended from the ble&s;&s;ed abodes, to teach mankind; whereas the Son of God came down from hea|ven, fully commi&s;&s;ioned from above: he had been favoured with the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive view of &s;piritual things, and was fully acquainted with the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the divine councils; nay, at this very time, is pre&s;ent with God in heaven, and at one comprehen&s;ive view, beholde&s;t the extent of the univer&s;e; he is con&s;cious to all the gra|cious intentions of the King of heaven towards the human race, and, of con&s;equence, mu&s;t be &s;uperior in authority and dignity to Mo&s;es, or any other per&s;on who hath ap|peared in the world.</P>
<P>OUR great Redeemer, before the conference concluded, took occa&s;ion to &s;et the in|quiring ruler to rights, re&s;pecting the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah, concerning which he &s;o much wanted to be informed. He gave him to under&s;tand, that the nation in general, were greatly mi&s;taken in their views of that exalted per&s;on &s;etting up a temporal king|dom, and a&s;&s;uming the authority and command of an illu&s;trious and powerful conquer|or; on the contrary, this divine teacher explained to Nicodemus, that it was conformable to the language of the ancient prophecy, as well as the councils of heaven, that the Me&s;&s;iah, when he appeared in the world, &s;hould be poor and de&s;pi&s;ed; that he &s;hould a&s;&s;ume no titles of honour, but be expo&s;ed to a variety of mi&s;ery, poverty, and wretchedne&s;s; and, of con&s;equence, his kingdom mu&s;t not be a temporal, but &s;piritual kingdom; and the deliver|ance, which he came to procure for his people, was not from temporal evils, but eternal wrath. This deliverance he proceeded to inform the noble Phari&s;ee, mu&s;t be procured by his &s;ufferings and death, by which, who&s;oever believed on him, would be rein&s;tated in the divine favour, and made eternally happy: but who&s;oever refu&s;ed to receive him as their Saviour, and per&s;i&s;ted in their ob&s;tinacy and unbelief, would certainly peri&s;h for ever, and ju&s;tly fall into &s;o &s;evere a condemnation, becau&s;e their unbelief would not ari&s;e from want of evidence of the truth of his mi&s;&s;ion, but from their own inveterate prejudices, and the habitual wickedne&s;s of their hearts and lives. <HI>He that believeth on him is not condemned,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>but he that believeth not, is condemned already, becau&s;e he believeth not in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds were evil.</HI></P>
<P>THIS excellent and pathetic di&s;cour&s;e of our Lord, had an effect on Nicodemus propor|tionable to the importance of it; he not only believed that JESUS was a teacher &s;ent from God, but was convinced that he was that great per&s;on who was to be the Redeemer of
<PB N="39" REF="029927_0042_0FE335CF74608DD8">
I&s;rael. He con&s;tantly defended him in the council; and when JESUS was put to death, by the impious rage, and unexampled cruelty of the Jews, he, in conjunction with Jo&s;eph of Arimathea, begged the body of our Lord, of the Roman governor, and be&s;towed on him the honour of a decent funeral, when all the re&s;t of his di&s;ciples had for&s;aken him.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CHRIST</HI> conver&s;es with the woman of Samaria, and revealeth him&s;elf unto her: he heals the nobleman's &s;on at Cana, while he lay &s;ick at Capernaum. He repairs to Capernaum, and having called more di&s;ciples, he preaches in Galilee, and delivers his &s;ermon on the Mount.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over being ended, JESUS departed from Jeru&s;alem, and went to &s;ome of the ob&s;curer parts of Judea; probably he might retire to the bank of the river Jordan, where he had been baptized, and had received the honour of the di|vine approbation, and the te&s;timony of a voice from heaven, that he was the Son of God. The holy JESUS, remained here a con&s;iderable time, and his di&s;ciples baptized great numbers of people, while his fame was &s;pread through &s;everal parts of the country.</P>
<P>JOHN the Bapti&s;t was not yet ca&s;t into pri&s;on, but continued preaching and baptizing, probably at Bethabara, the place, of his former re&s;idence. Some of the Jews, hence took occa&s;ion to di&s;pute with the di&s;ciples of John, about the propriety of this, and wanted to be informed, whether the bapti&s;m of JESUS was not &s;uperior to that of their ma&s;ter. Not being willing them&s;elves to decide this controver&s;y, or an&s;wer &s;o important a que&s;tion, they applied to the Bapti&s;t him&s;elf. The prophet took occa&s;ion to remind them&punc; how often he had declared, that the per&s;on they mentioned, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Me&s;&s;iah, whom God had &s;ent into the world, to accompli&s;h the de&s;igns of his grace, in the &s;al|vation of &s;inners; and that him&s;elf was no more than a me&s;&s;enger to prepare the way be|fore this illu&s;trious per&s;on. He likewi&s;e proceeded to inform them, that his own mi|ni&s;try now was on the decline, and would &s;oon be at an end; <HI>He mu&s;t increa&s;e,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>but I mu&s;t decrea&s;e.</HI> The holy man continued his te&s;timony concerning CHRIST, by giving his inquiring di&s;ciples to under&s;tand that he was above all; and as much &s;uperior to him, as the heavens were above the earth; and though, comparatively &s;peaking, no man received his te&s;timony, though he was low and de&s;picable in the eyes of mankind, yet he was in the highe&s;t e&s;timation in the heavenly world; that he was the well-beloved of his Father, and the heir of all things, both in heaven and earth; that the fulne&s;s of the divine Spirit dwelt in him, and it was of the utmo&s;t importance to man|kind to hear, believe in, and obey him. And then the holy man concluded his mini&s;try with the&s;e remarkable words, <HI>He that believeth on the Son hath everla&s;ting life; but he that believeth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</HI></P>
<P>SOON after this, the holy Bapti&s;t departed from the banks of Jordan, and leaving the wilderne&s;s of Judea, repaired to Galilee, and often vi&s;ited the court of Herod, who &s;eemed to attend to his precepts, and take delight in his company and conver&s;ation: but, as the Bapti&s;t was too &s;trictly virtuous to flatter that prince, he took occa&s;ion &s;everely to reprimand him, on account of his cohabiting with the prince&s;s Herodias. This rou&s;ed the rage of that haughty woman, who, on that account, procured his im|pri&s;onment and death, in the manner before related.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="029927_0043_0FE335D0F93A5C30">IN the mean time, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS continued in the wilderne&s;s of Judea; great multi|tudes re&s;orted to him, attended on his divine in&s;tructions, beheld the miracles he wrought, and were baptized by his di&s;ciples. His popularity daily increa&s;ing, it excited the envy of the Phari&s;ees, on which account, our Lord thought proper to retire into Galilee, and there continue that great work which he had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully begun.</P>
<P>IN this journey, he pa&s;&s;ed through Samaria, and being fatigued with travelling, and overpowered with the heat of the day, he &s;at down to re&s;t by the &s;ide of a noted well, near the city of Sychar (which was reported to be given by the patriarch Jacob to his &s;on Jo&s;eph) while his di&s;ciples repaired to the city to purcha&s;e provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>BEFORE their return, a woman came from the city to draw water at the well, and JESUS being thir&s;ty, a&s;ked her to give him to drink. The woman, knowing him to be a Jew, was very much &s;urpri&s;ed at this reque&s;t; for the hatred between the Jews and Samaritans, which had commenced four hundred years before this time, &s;till continued, and was, on all occa&s;ions carried on by each party: <HI>How is it,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>that thou, being a Jew, a&s;ke&s;t drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</HI> Little did the woman think, that no le&s;s a per&s;on than the Son of God, reque&s;ted this &s;mall favour at her hands: had &s;he been acquainted with his high dignity, &s;he would certainly, with|out he&s;itation, have granted his reque&s;t. But JESUS, perceiving her delay, proceeded to let her know, that he was well able to make her the mo&s;t noble and beneficial return for the favour he a&s;ked. <HI>If thou,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>knewe&s;t the gift of God, and who it is that &s;aith unto thee, give me to drink: thou woulde&s;t have a&s;ked of him, and he would have giving thee living water.</HI> The woman &s;urpri&s;ed to hear &s;uch a declaration, and no doubt, perceiving &s;omething awfully maje&s;tic, and divinely amiable in the countenance of our Lord, with|out attending to his fir&s;t reque&s;t, was touched with a curio&s;ity to know who this &s;tranger was, and how he could come at the water he &s;poke of: <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>thou ha&s;t nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; from whence then ha&s;t thou that living water? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof him&s;elf, and his children, and his cattle?</HI> JESUS replied to this que&s;tion, <HI>Who&s;oever drinketh of this water &s;hall thir&s;t again; but who&s;oever drinketh of the water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall never thir&s;t, but the water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall be in him, a well of water &s;pringing up unto ever|la&s;ting life.</HI> Thus this divine teacher, from the circum&s;tances of &s;itting by the &s;ide of a well, and the woman preparing to draw water, de&s;cribed, in the mo&s;t beautiful allegory, the efficacy and effects of divine grace, and at the &s;ame time repre&s;ented the plenitude and perpetuity of its happy con&s;equences, which remain to an eternal duration. But the woman, &s;till under&s;tanding the words of our Lord in their plain literal &s;en&s;e, re|que&s;ted him to give her a draught of the water he &s;poke of, that &s;he might thir&s;t no more, nor have occa&s;ion to come daily to that well to draw. Our Redeemer then turned the di&s;cour&s;e in &s;uch a manner, as gave him an opportunity of letting the woman under|&s;tand, that he was acquainted with her former and pre&s;ent way of life, and all her circum|&s;tances and affairs. <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>I perceive that thou art a prophet:</HI> and being convinced of his &s;uperior knowledge, &s;he de&s;ired his opinion of a que&s;tion which was a matter of contention between the Jews and Samaritans, whether the temple at Jeru&s;alem, or mount Gerizim was the place where God would be wor&s;hipped: <HI>Our Fathers,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>wor&s;hipped in this mountain: but ye &s;ay, that in Jeru&s;alem is the place were men ought to wor&s;hip.</HI> Our Lord, in an&s;wer to her inquiry, informed her, that the time would &s;oon approach, when the wor&s;hip of God would not be confined, either to that mountain or Jeru&s;alem; but the great King of the univer&s;e, would be willing to accept all true &s;piritual wor&s;hippers, without any re|gard to the place where they wor&s;hipped. <HI>God,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is a Spirit; and they that wor&s;hip him, mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth.</HI> The woman replied to this, that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="41" REF="029927_0044_0FE30EAB99CBB2E0">
this point would be &s;ettled by the Me&s;&s;iah, who was &s;hortly expected to come, both by the Jews and the Samaritans. <HI>I know,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>that the Me&s;&s;iah cometh, which is called Chri&s;t: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</HI> To this JESUS directly replied, <HI>I that &s;peak unto thee am he.</HI></P>
<P>JUST at the moment when JESUS had told the woman that he was the Me&s;&s;iah, the di&s;ci|ples returned; and finding their ma&s;ter in clo&s;e conver&s;ation with one that was a native of Samaria, and of con&s;equence an enemy to the Jews, and to the temple wor&s;hip at Jeru&s;alem, they were very much &s;urpri&s;ed: but the woman, having heard JESUS call him&s;elf the Me&s;&s;iah, left her pitcher at the well, and ran to the city, to publi&s;h the glad-tidings, that the Redeemer was then &s;itting at Jacob's well, and had told her all the &s;ecret tran&s;actions of her life. This declaration filled the li&s;tening Samaritans with the highe&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, and at the &s;ame time rai&s;ed their curio&s;ity to &s;ee this extraordinary per&s;on, whom Mo&s;es and the prophets had foretold, and of who&s;e appearance, there was at that time, &s;o univer&s;al an expectation.</P>
<P>DURING this interval, the di&s;ciples &s;et before their Lord the provi&s;ions which they had been procuring, and reque&s;ted him to eat; but he &s;eemed little to regard their intreaties, having turned his thoughts to divine meditations: but being further urged, he replied, <HI>that he had meat to eat which they knew not of;</HI> and gave them to under&s;tand, that it was meat and drink to him to do the will, and proceed in the work of his heavenly Father: then looking about him, and &s;eeing the Samaritans coming in crowds from their city; he &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, <HI>Say ye not that there are yet four months, and then cometh the harve&s;t? Behold, I &s;ay unto you, lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, for they are white already to harve&s;t; and he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit into life eternal, that both he that &s;oweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</HI> By this our Lord in&s;tructed his wondering di&s;ciples, and let them know that the conver&s;ion of the&s;e Samaritans, who were now in great crowds &s;ur|rounding him, was a greater &s;atisfaction to him, than the plea&s;ure he could receive from the refre&s;hment he might have experienced in partaking of their provi&s;ions: he let them know, that to gather this &s;piritual harve&s;t, and fini&s;h the work of his heavenly Father, was his proper food; and adding, for the encouragement of his di&s;ciples, that as they had laboured with him in this harve&s;t of &s;ouls, &s;o &s;hould they be partakers in the eternal harve&s;t of joy, which would be the reward of their diligence in the work of God.</P>
<P>THE words of the woman had taken &s;uch an effect on the inhabitants of the city, that many of them believed that JESUS was certainly the Me&s;&s;iah; and when they crowded about him with wonder and joy, their fir&s;t reque&s;t was, that he would conde&s;cend to go to their city, and take his abode among&s;t them. The kind, indulgent Saviour of &s;inners was &s;o favourable to them, that he complied with their petition, and &s;taid with them two days. This time he &s;pent in preaching the kingdom of God, and in&s;tructing them in the nature of his religion. Such &s;ucce&s;s attended his mini&s;try, that a great number of the inhabitants of the city believed on him, and declared unto the woman at his departure, <HI>Now we believe, not becau&s;e of thy &s;aying; for we have heard him our&s;elves, and know that this is indeed the Chri&s;t, the Saviour of the World.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord, having thus favoured the Samaritans with his heavenly in&s;tructions, he left the city of Sychar, and continued his journey to Galilee: and though he did not expect much honour or e&s;teem among&s;t his countrymen, he would not neglect giving them an opportunity of receiving his heavenly doctrine. He had performed &s;everal miracles at Jeru&s;alem, during the late fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over, at which many of the inha|bitants of Galilee were pre&s;ent: his preaching among&s;t them, in con&s;equence of this,
<PB N="42" REF="029927_0045_0FE335DFC0646720">
was at fir&s;t attended with great &s;ucce&s;s, and he dwelt &s;ome &s;mall time at Cana, where he had turned the water into wine, and both him&s;elf and his doctrine were kindly received.</P>
<P>WHILE he abode at that city, a nobleman of Capernaum, having heard of the many miracles he performed, came to him, and addre&s;&s;ed him with the utmo&s;t reverence and re&s;pect; at the &s;ame time humbly be&s;eeching him to come to Capernaum, and heal his &s;on, who lay at the point of death. Our Lord was &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate, as to comply with the latter part of the reque&s;t, but thought proper to give the concerned parent to under|&s;tand, that there was no nece&s;&s;ity for him to take a journey to Capernaum to effect this cure; for that great Being, who was pre&s;ent in all places, could perform his mighty works, without per&s;onally appearing at the place where the miracle was wrought: JESUS, therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the father, with a declaration that his &s;on was re&s;tored to health, but refu&s;ed to accompany him to his city: <HI>Go thy way,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>thy &s;on liveth.</HI> The noble|man, not doubting the truth of what our Lord had declared, departed to his hou&s;e; but, before his arrival, he was met on the road by his &s;ervants, who brought the joyful news, that his &s;on was perfectly recovered. The father inquired, at what time they perceived the fir&s;t alteration in him; the &s;ervants replied, <HI>Ye&s;terday, at the &s;eventh hour, the fever left him.</HI> By this, the joyful father perceived, that his &s;on recovered immediately as JESUS had &s;poken the words, <HI>thy &s;on liveth;</HI> and was fully convinced, that this cure was performed by the mighty power of God. This amazing in&s;tance of divine power and goodne&s;s, fully convinced the nobleman, and all his family, not only that JESUS was a true prophet, but that he was the Me&s;&s;iah, that great deliverer of his people, &s;o long expected in the world.</P>
<P>SOME &s;hort time after this, JESUS departed from Cana, and went to Nazareth, the place where he had been brought up, and where he had dwelt till he entered on his public mini&s;try. There, as had been his con&s;tant cu&s;tom, he went to the &s;ynagogue on the Sabbath-day, and attended on the reading of the law and the prophets. After the pa&s;&s;ages appointed for the &s;ervice of the day were read, JESUS took the book from the hand of the per&s;on who officiated, and opened it on this celebrated prediction of the Me&s;&s;iah, in the prophecy of I&s;aiah, <HI>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becau&s;e he hath anointed me to preach the go&s;pel to the poor; he hath &s;ent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deli|verance to the captives, and recovering of &s;ight to the blind, to &s;et at liberty them that are brui&s;ed, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>IT is the opinion of &s;ome learned and judicious commentators, that our Lord read this pa&s;&s;age in native Hebrew, which was then a dead language, and as it was known by his town&s;men, that he was not learned, it excited their admiration, e&s;pecially when he ex|pounded it with &s;uch clearne&s;s of judgment, and beauty of expre&s;&s;ion; and what the more rai&s;ed their a&s;toni&s;hment, he applied it to him&s;elf: but as he had performed no miracles in their city, they &s;eemed to be offended: perhaps they imagined, that the place of his nativity &s;hould have claimed his fir&s;t regard, and that his friends and town&s;men &s;hould have been the objects of his peculiar care; and as it appeared, that with a word, he could heal the &s;ick or di&s;ea&s;ed, at a di&s;tance, it is very likely, they thought that there &s;hould not have been one &s;ick, lame, or blind per&s;on, at Nazareth. That they really entertained &s;uch &s;entiments as the&s;e, is plain from our Saviour's own words, <HI>Ye will &s;urely &s;ay to me, Phy&s;ician, heal thy&s;elf; whatever we have had done in Capernaum, do al&s;o here in thy country:</HI> they &s;eem to have hinted to our Lord, that it was unkind in him to heal the nobleman's &s;on at Capernaum, and take no notice of the &s;ick and di&s;ea&s;ed at Nazareth; which being the place of his nativity and re&s;idence, &s;hould have been a larger &s;harer in his benevolence and care, than tho&s;e cities which were unknown to him, and therefore could have no claim on his goodne&s;s. To this in&s;inuation, our Lord thought fit to reply,
<PB N="43" REF="029927_0046_0FE335E1678CE890">
by giving them an account of the conduct of the two great prophets Elijah and Eli&s;ha, who were directed by the God of I&s;rael, to exert tho&s;e miraculous powers, which he had given them, in favour of Heathens, when many of the people of I&s;rael &s;tood in need of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. <HI>I tell you of a truth,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>many widows were in I&s;rael in the days of Elias, when the heaven was &s;hut up three years and &s;ix months, when great famine was throughout all the land; but unto none of them was Elias &s;ent, &s;ave unto Sarepta, a city of Si|don, unto a woman that was a widow. And many lepers were in I&s;rael in the time of Elizeus the prophet; and none of them was clean&s;ed, &s;aving Naaman the Syrian.</HI> No &s;ooner had our Redeemer &s;poken the&s;e words, than the &s;ynagogue was in an uproar; the whole a&s;&s;em|bly foamed with rage, and was the more unruly and turbulent, becau&s;e none of them knew how to reply; but forgetting the &s;olemnity of the Sabbath, they &s;eized the Savi|our of the world, and took him by force, to the brow of the hill on which their city &s;tood, thinking to have thrown him down, and da&s;hed him to pieces; but no &s;ooner were they come to the place where they intended to have put their cruel de&s;igns in exe|cution, than they were impre&s;&s;ed with awe; and each looked on the other, none dar|ing to make the horrid attempt. Our Redeemer perceiving the con&s;ternation which they were in, departed from among&s;t them, and none pre&s;umed to detain him.</P>
<P>OUR Saviour being thus treated by the blind, outrageous fury of his town&s;men, and the cruel u&s;age he had received, he removed his place of re&s;idence, and for &s;ome time abode at Capernaum. This was the capital city of Galilee, and was built on the borders of the lake of Gene&s;areth.</P>
<P>IT may not be improper in this place, to give a &s;hort account of this lake. It is called, in the Old Te&s;tament, the &s;ea of Chinnereth; but, in the Evangeli&s;ts, it has three &s;everal names: it is called the &s;ea of Galilee, from the province where it was &s;ituated; the &s;ea of Tiberias, from a city of that name on its we&s;tern &s;hore; and the lake of Gene&s;areth, from the name of a con&s;iderable part of Galilee, extending along its we&s;tern &s;hore. Accor|ding to Jo&s;ephus, it was twenty-two miles in length, and five in breadth: the bottom being of gravel, rendered the water both clear and good ta&s;ted: it was &s;aid to be &s;ofter than either fountain or river water, and at the &s;ame time &s;o cold, that it would not grow warm, though expo&s;ed to the rays of the &s;un in the hotte&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year. The river Jordan runs through this lake, and it abounds with plenty of excellent fi&s;h, and &s;ome &s;orts that are not to be found in any other place.</P>
<P>THE countries &s;urrounding this lake, according to the above mentioned hi&s;torian, were fertile and populous, e&s;pecially the two Galilees, which contained a great number of towns and villages, the lea&s;t of which included fifteen hundred &s;ouls. On the ea&s;t &s;ide, were the cities of Chora&s;in, Beth&s;aida, Gadara, and Hippon; on the we&s;t, Capernaum, Tiberias, and Tarrichea. From all the&s;e advantages, it was a common &s;aying among&s;t the Jews, that God had a peculiar love to the &s;ea of Galilee: and if we con&s;ider, that, added to the above-named privileges, it was &s;o often favoured with the pre&s;ence of our great Redeemer, we mu&s;t allow that the ob&s;ervation was ju&s;t; for frequent were his excur&s;ions on the&s;e waters, while he dwelt at Capernaum; and once he honoured them with his pre&s;ence, and worked a miracle in their &s;treams, after he had ri&s;en from the dead.</P>
<P>IT was the divine will, that JESUS &s;hould &s;pend a con&s;iderable time in preaching, and working miracles, to confirm the truth of his divine mi&s;&s;ion, and in&s;truct his di&s;ciples in the doctrine which they were afterwards to preach through all the nations of the world. He did not chu&s;e to take up his abode at Jeru&s;alem, becau&s;e he knew the oppo&s;ition which he would meet with from the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, the chief prie&s;ts and rulers, and the great men of the nation. The ambition and envy of the&s;e men would never have

&s;uffered &s;o celebrated a teacher as JESUS CHRIST, to have re&s;ided among&s;t them. Our Lord therefore cho&s;e to re&s;ide at Capernaum, where he had lately, by re&s;toring the noble|man's &s;on, procured him&s;elf friends, and he was &s;ure of a kind reception. Nor is it unlikely, that &s;o great and benevolent a miracle &s;hould be generally known in the city, and not have influenced the minds of the inhabitants in favour of our Redeemer, while it pre|pared them for the reception of his heavenly doctrine. This city &s;eemed a place highly convenient for the execution of his great and benevolent de&s;igns; for it being the capi|tal of the country, and nearly bordering on the lake, it was frequently crowded with merchants and traders; who, on their return to their re&s;pective countries, might &s;pread the report of what they might be eye and ear witne&s;&s;es of; and by this means, the mi|racles and doctrine of the Saviour of the world, might be related in di&s;tant places. It was in the city of Capernaum, and the adjacent cities and villages bordering on the lake, that our great Redeemer &s;pent two out of three years of his public life; mo&s;t commonly going to Jeru&s;alem at the public fea&s;ts, but &s;oon returning. He frequently preached in the &s;ynagogues on the Sabbath-day, not only in Capernaum, but in the other cities of Galilee; and often the country villages, the fields, the mountains, the plains, and the waters of the lake were ble&s;&s;ed with his pre&s;ence; and his heavenly doc|trine was learned by the attentive multitudes who followed him, to hear his words and &s;ee his wondrous works.</P>
<P>IT was in one of the&s;e excur&s;ions, that he called Simon, and Andrew. The&s;e di&s;ci|ples were following their occupation of fi&s;hing on the lake: they had known him before, and immediately followed him. Soon after, he &s;aw James, and John, who were bu&s;y in the &s;ame employment: he called them al&s;o, and they readily obeyed. Perhaps, they might have been acquainted with our Redeemer on the banks of Jordan; or if not, his call was accompanied with &s;uch a manife&s;tation of divine power, that all their &s;cruples were overcome, and with a joyful readine&s;s and elevation of mind, they followed the Saviour of the world.</P>
<P>ACCOMPANIED by the&s;e di&s;ciples, our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer took a tour through &s;everal cities, towns, and villages in Galilee: the time he &s;pent in this progre&s;s, is not particu|larly noted by the evangeli&s;ts, but we are told, that he wrought a great number of mi|racles, that he healed the di&s;ea&s;es of tho&s;e that applied to him, and performed &s;uch won|derful works, that his fame drew great multitudes of people after him, not only from Galilee, but the remoter parts of Judea, and even from beyond Jordan: nor was the fame of the wonders he performed, confined to the land of I&s;rael, for the inhabitants of Syria brought their &s;ick into the province of Galilee, to be healed by the Saviour of mankind.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, perceiving him&s;elf followed by a va&s;t multitude of people, who all crowded around him, with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s and attention, a&s;cended a mountain that was near at hand, and placing him&s;elf on an eminence, while all the people &s;tood on the &s;ides of the hill, he addre&s;&s;ed the li&s;tening throng from thence; and with the mo&s;t intelligent &s;implicity and plainne&s;s, joined with the mo&s;t powerful heart-affecting energy, he inculcated in them the moral precepts of his religion.</P>
<P>HE began his divine di&s;cour&s;e, with the doctrine of happine&s;s, a &s;ubject which had claimed the fir&s;t attention of the &s;chools of the philo&s;ophers, and the wi&s;e men of the age; and a &s;ubject, which, in its own nature, claims the con&s;ideration of every intelligent being, and the more &s;o, as the wi&s;e&s;t of mankind have differed very much in their defi|nitions what true happine&s;s is, as well as the means by which it is to be attained. The Jews in general, concluded it to con&s;i&s;t in opulence, grandeur, and glory: on that ac|count
<PB N="45" REF="029927_0048_0FE335E470BEF930">
they wi&s;hed to &s;ee the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, becau&s;e they &s;uppo&s;ed it would be a temporal dominion, and that a golden &s;ceptre, in&s;tead of a <HI>&s;ceptre of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> would be the <HI>&s;ceptre of his kingdom;</HI> and &s;o prevailing was the opinion of the temporal reign of the Me&s;&s;iah, that the di&s;ciples them&s;elves retained this notion, till after his re&s;urrection, and probably were induced to follow him at fir&s;t, by the expectation of high honours and rewards.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, therefore, thought fit to &s;hew his hearers in general, and his di&s;ciples in particular, their mi&s;takes in &s;o important a point, and let them know, that happine&s;s did not con&s;i&s;t in the abundance of things po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, nor in the opinion which the world might form concerning them, but in an entire re&s;ignation of mind to the will of God, who is perfectly wi&s;e and good, who orders and di&s;po&s;es all things with the utmo&s;t accuracy and exactne&s;s, &s;o as to promote the be&s;t intere&s;t of his people; and an acknowledgment of his &s;uperior wi&s;dom, and our own blindne&s;s and folly, tends to the ea&s;e and quiet of our minds, when we are oppre&s;&s;ed and afflicted, and cannot di&s;cern the wi&s;e ends of his di&s;pen&s;ations. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> &s;aid our great Redeemer, <HI>are the poor in &s;pirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</HI> And though the &s;en&s;e of our own meanne&s;s and unworthine&s;s might excite us to mourn, and fill us with &s;orrow of heart, the divine teacher informed his hearers, that this was a true &s;ign of &s;ucceeding happine&s;s: <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>are they that mourn, for they &s;hall be com|forted.</HI> Our exalted Redeemer further proceeded to inform his attentive hearers, that true happine&s;s did not con&s;i&s;t in the gratification of their inordinate pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations, but in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of them, and keeping them within the bounds of rea&s;on and religion. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the meek, for they &s;hall inherit the earth. Ble&s;&s;ed are they which do hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, for they &s;hall be filled. Ble&s;&s;ed are the merciful, for they &s;hall obtain mercy. Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in heart, for they &s;hall &s;ee God.</HI> The divine teacher then proceeded to ob&s;erve, that happine&s;s did not con&s;i&s;t in what the world calls conque&s;t and glory; for tyrants and conquerors, who di&s;turb the peace, and de&s;troy the comforts of mankind are mo&s;t deplorably mi&s;erable: but true happine&s;s falls to the &s;hare of tho&s;e who are lovers of peace, and &s;eek to promote kindne&s;s, benevolence, and all the &s;ocial affections among&s;t men; for they imitate the perfection of heavenly goodne&s;s, which &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly &s;hines in their Maker, and will therefore be called his children. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the peace makers,</HI> &s;aid our exalted Redeemer, <HI>for they &s;hall be called the children of God.</HI> And if the&s;e holy and amiable per&s;ons, &s;hould not at fir&s;t find that happine&s;s, which they are entitled to as heirs of heaven; though they &s;hould be reviled and per&s;ecuted by the wicked of this world; though they &s;hould be deprived of their comforts, and undergo the &s;evere&s;t trials; yet the great Saviour of mankind pronounces them ble&s;&s;ed. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>are they that are per&s;ecuted for righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</HI> Solid contentment and true happine&s;s, the heavenly teacher informs us, are not to be expected from the prai&s;e of men, nor from the noi&s;e of popular applau&s;e, but will hereafter be the portion of tho&s;e who are fal&s;ely reviled for their integrity and uprightne&s;s, and their &s;teady attachment to truth; &s;uch per&s;ons mea&s;urably partake of the &s;ufferings of CHRIST: and it was by the&s;e per&s;ecutions, and the contempt of the world, that the prophets have been in all ages di&s;tingui&s;hed. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are ye when men &s;hall revile you, and per&s;ecute you, and &s;ay all manner of evil again&s;t you fal&s;ely for my &s;ake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven; for &s;o per&s;ecuted they the prophets which were before you.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH were the declarations of the Son of God, with reference to the happine&s;s of man; after which, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his di&s;ciples, and pointed out their duty as preachers of the go&s;pel, de&s;igned by the &s;overeign Ruler of all things, to teach his will, and lead others in the paths of eternal happine&s;s. But, as the doctrine which he had ad|vanced was &s;o directly contrary to the traditions of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, our Re|deemer
<PB N="46" REF="029927_0049_0FE335F133C743A8">
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to inform his di&s;ciples, that he had no intention to de&s;troy the moral precepts contained in the law and the prophets, but to fulfil and confirm them. Nothing is more firm, and fixed on a more immovable ba&s;is, than the great precepts of morality: the&s;e, being copied from the perfections of God, mu&s;t remain fixed and immov|able: the eternal laws of righteou&s;ne&s;s cannot be altered; heaven and earth will pa&s;s away, but the moral law of God will always remain the &s;ame. This our great Redeemer &s;trictly enjoined his di&s;ciples to inforce in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, both by precept and example; and gave them &s;everal in&s;tances in which the Scribes and Phari&s;ees had interpreted the moral law in too loo&s;e and carele&s;s a manner. He then conde&s;cended to a&s;&s;i&s;t their de|votions, by teaching them that excellent form of Prayer, which is called by his name, and is in con&s;tant u&s;e among&s;t Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P><HI>OUR Father which art in Heaven.</HI> The great Creator and Pre&s;erver of men, may be, with the highe&s;t propriety, called our Father; for it is to his almighty power, that we owe our exi&s;tence; he is, in a peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing manner called the Father of &s;pirits, becau&s;e he alone is the author of all &s;piritual exi&s;tence. The form of our bodies owes its original, to his boundle&s;s, unerring wi&s;dom, and all our active powers are the produce of his all-creating goodne&s;s. Nor is it only by right of creation, that the eternal God may ju&s;tly claim the title of our Father; but the &s;ame endearing appellations is due to him on account of our daily pre&s;ervation: he watches over us, with the care of a Father, and we are con&s;tantly made &s;harers in the benefits of his paternal tenderne&s;s and protection. But there is &s;till another and more emphatical &s;en&s;e, wherein God is the Father of his people: it is by the almighty power of his &s;pirit, that they are regenerated; and this great work is frequently, in the New Te&s;tament, &s;tyled being born of God: by this it is, that poor, lo&s;t, undone &s;inners, are formed anew, &s;o that, partaking of his divine nature, they become his children indeed, and are permitted to lift up their eyes to the great King of the univer&s;e, and call him their Father. In the former &s;en&s;e, God is the Father of the creation, and a parent to all his creatures, good or bad: but in the latter &s;en&s;e, he is a Father only to his own people, who are converted by his almighty power and &s;pirit, enabled to believe in his Son, and to live &s;uch lives as are con&s;i&s;tent with the rulers of his go&s;pel. Father, is the mo&s;t grand and magnificent title which can be found in the whole compa&s;s of nature, and it conveys the mo&s;t honourable and lovely idea that can be formed in the human mind: it is particularly happy in marking the e&s;&s;ential character of the true God, who is the great Father of the univer&s;e. This noble and tender appellation not only di&s;plays him as the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all things, but gives us a beautiful and lovely idea of his tenderne&s;s and care, which he extends over all his creatures, whom he nouri&s;hes with an affection, and protects with a watchfulne&s;s and care, va&s;tly &s;uperior to an earthly parent. We are permitted and encouraged to call the eternal God our Father, to encourage our hope in his goodne&s;s, and mercy, in granting us every reque&s;t that is not improper to be be&s;towed: for a father would not deny a petition to a child, if it was in his power to give, and the petition was fit to be granted: and at the &s;ame time, our being permitted to call God our Father, &s;hould rai&s;e in us an holy emulation, by exciting us to con&s;ider what &s;ort of children we ought to be, who claim &s;o high and honourable a relation. And our being exhorted to call God our Father, in the plural number, ought to put us in mind that we are all brethren, the chil|dren of one common parent, and that we &s;hould love one another in &s;incerity, and &s;incerely and fervently pray for the good of each other.</P>
<P><HI>WHICH art in Heaven.</HI> By the&s;e words, we are commanded to expre&s;s the glory, ma|je&s;ty, and power of the great God: his pre&s;ence is not confined to the heavenly worlds; the heaven of heavens cannot contain him; the whole univer&s;e lies open to his eye: his pre&s;ence extends it&s;elf through the infinitude of &s;pace: at one va&s;t comprehen&s;ive view,

he beholds the whole creation, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come, heaven is his throne, and earth is his foot-&s;tool; the night and the day, the darkne&s;s and the light, are equal to him, he &s;ees all things both in heaven and in earth; <HI>even hell is naked before him, and de&s;truction hath no covering.</HI> But, by God's being in heaven, we are to under&s;tand, that this is the place where his glories are plaine&s;t &s;een, and where he is be&s;t wor&s;hipped.</P>

<P><HI>GIVE us this day our daily bread.</HI> Be plea&s;ed, O thou great parent of the univer&s;e! who &s;upplie&s;t all thy creatures from the rich fountain of thy fullne&s;s, to give us, day by day, &s;uch a portion of thy creature-comforts, as may enable us to &s;erve thee with cheer|fulne&s;s and &s;atisfaction of mind.</P>
<P><HI>AND forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,</HI> God being the &s;upreme and righte|ous governor of the world, he hath a right to puni&s;h tho&s;e who break his ju&s;t and equitable laws. The &s;uffering of puni&s;hment is therefore a debt, which &s;inners owe to &s;upreme ju&s;tice: and when we are commanded to pray, that God will forgive us our debts, the meaning is, that he will remit that dreadful puni&s;hment due to our &s;ins. This enormous debt, the great king of the univer&s;e, on account of the &s;atisfaction which his ju&s;tice has received, in the blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s of his Son, is ready to forgive to all that believe in him, with &s;uch a lively and powerful faith, as produces a &s;teady and prevailing obedience to his go&s;pel. But the infinite mercy of God in forgiving our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, ought at all times to be remembered by us, in &s;uch a manner as to &s;often our minds, and in&s;pire them with a readine&s;s to forgive tho&s;e who have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t us. We give but a poor evidence, that by a &s;incere and influential faith, we are become partakers of divine forgivene&s;s, if we indulge an unforgiving temper of mind, and pur&s;ue with inexorable and implacable re&s;entment, tho&s;e who have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t us.</P>

Make us &s;en&s;ible, O our God! how weak and frail we are; may we never pre&s;ume on our own &s;trength, but depending on thy grace,

<P><HI>FOR thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever and ever.</HI> Thou, O God! art the eternal, univer&s;al monarch, thy kingdom is an everla&s;ting kingdom, and thy do|minion extendeth over all: the government of the univer&s;e is thine, and thou reigne&s;t the great independent King of the creation: thou, by thine infinite power, fir&s;t did&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h, and now pre&s;erve&s;t the &s;tupendous frame of nature: all power in heaven and earth is in thine hand, thou can&s;t do what thou plea&s;e&s;t, and none can &s;tay thine hand, or &s;ay unto thee, What doe&s;t thou?

<P>SUCH was the prayer which the Son of God him&s;elf delivered to the multitude who &s;urrounded him; from which it may be learned, that the great King of the univer&s;e, who is &s;eated on the exalted throne of heaven, &s;urrounded by angels and archangels, and con|&s;tantly adored by all the holy and happy inhabitants of the upper world, is &s;o kind and conde&s;cendingly good, as to hear the cries, and attend to the petitions of &s;inful men. What an animating, heart reviving thought it is, that poor, frail, &s;inful creatures are per|mitted to &s;tand before the throne of the eternal God, and call him our Father! The glim|mering light of the dim-winking taper, which &s;leeps in its &s;ocket, is not more exceeded by the &s;plendor and glory of the &s;un &s;hining in his &s;trength, than the brightne&s;s of the throne, the extent of the dominions, the power, glory, and maje&s;ty of the great King of the crea|tion, exceeds the mo&s;t exalted prince on earth. Earthly princes are &s;o proud, and their mini&s;ters and attendants &s;o covetous and haughty, that they are rendered inacce&s;&s;ible to the greate&s;t part of their &s;ubjects; but the great Monarch of the univer&s;e, the &s;upreme Lord of heaven and earth, is ea&s;y of acce&s;s; he calls upon &s;inners to &s;eek his face, and the meane&s;t of mankind may at all times have free acce&s;s to his exalted throne. How blind and &s;tupid, how regardle&s;s of their be&s;t intere&s;t, how cruel to them&s;elves are tho&s;e men who will not pray! We are poor nece&s;&s;itous creatures; we &s;tand in need of various ble&s;&s;ings; God hath all things to give; and God hath &s;aid, <HI>a&s;k and ye &s;hall receive:</HI> he hath erected a throne of grace, and is at all times ready to hear and an&s;wer our prayers; and &s;hall we be &s;o very deficient as not to pray? Shall we, when in di&s;tre&s;s, and pre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ities, &s;tand at a gloomy di&s;tance, and refu&s;e to a&s;k? What folly and madne&s;s is this? It is highly incumbent on all who have neglected this duty, to con&s;ider their ways, to trea|&s;ure up our Lord's words in their hearts, and daily, with fervent prayer, approach the throne of that God, who is willing to hear, and able to help, in every time of need. And when we &s;eriou&s;ly reflect on this excellent Prayer propo&s;ed by the Son of God, and are admiring the va&s;t extent of divine mercy and forgivene&s;s, we ought to remember, that in this Prayer, we are reminded of our duty to forgive one another; and we may learn from hence, that a mild, placable, forgiving &s;pirit, is not only well-plea&s;ing to our heavenly Fa|ther, but has a manife&s;t tendency in its own nature, to prepare us, in the habitual temper of our minds, for the forgivene&s;s of God.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="029927_0052_0FE335F5C9809A18">THE next point, which our Lord treated on, in his admirable &s;ermon, was the duty of fa&s;ting. In this part of his di&s;cour&s;e, he &s;everely blamed the conduct of the Phari&s;ees, who made the greate&s;t o&s;tentation of their religion, and were particularly fond of morti|fication and fa&s;ting. Hence that they might be remarked for &s;uperior degrees of &s;trictne&s;s and &s;anctity, and appear to men of the mo&s;t reclu&s;e and mortified di&s;po&s;ition, they di&s;|figured their faces, and appeared with &s;ad and &s;orrowful countenances; but our Lord enjoins us not to perform our religious exerci&s;es, with de&s;ign to be &s;een of men, but, with all uprightne&s;s and &s;incerity of heart, to regard the omnipre&s;ence of our heavenly Father, who <HI>&s;eeth in &s;ecret</HI> and will <HI>reward openly</HI> all his faithful wor&s;hippers. The divine orator then turned his di&s;cour&s;e to another &s;ubject, and inculcated the nece&s;&s;ity of hea|venly-mindedne&s;s on his attentive and re&s;pectful audience. So va&s;tly important in their nature, and exten&s;ive in their duration, are the concerns of the &s;oul above tho&s;e of the body, that it is the highe&s;t wi&s;dom of man, clo&s;ely to attend to heavenly things, and at all times to give them the preference to the frail and fleeting trifles of this pre&s;ent world. <HI>Lay not up for your&s;elves trea&s;ures upon earth,</HI> &s;aid the heavenly Teacher, <HI>where moth and ru&s;t doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and &s;teal; but lay up for your&s;elves trea&s;ures in heaven, where neither moth nor ru&s;t doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through and &s;teal: for where your trea&s;ure it, there will your heart be al&s;o.</HI> The &s;hortne&s;s and uncertainty of our abode in this pre&s;ent &s;tate, with the many di&s;a&s;ters which may happen to us, and take away our worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;hould excite us not to put our tru&s;t or confidence in any thing which belongs to this world; it is greater wi&s;dom to contemplate on heavenly things, to con&s;ider their &s;uperior excellency, and the extent of their duration, with &s;uch a fixed and unremitting attention, as may work in the &s;oul an habitual de&s;ire after them, and prepare us, in the prevailing temper of our minds, for the enjoyment of them.</P>
<P>OUR Lord was the more earne&s;t in recommending this heavenly-mindedne&s;s to his hearers, becau&s;e it was a doctrine which they had not been u&s;ed to hear from their former teachers. The Jewi&s;h doctors were, in general, &s;trangers to the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and glory of an happy eternity. The rewards promi&s;ed to the keepers of the law, were chiefly of a temporal nature; and as it was the go&s;pel of CHRIST, which brought <HI>life and im|mortality to light,</HI> the doctrine of eternal happine&s;s was the peculiar province of our Re|deemer; and that they might not &s;uppo&s;e that the heavenly mindedne&s;s which he re|commended, was con&s;i&s;tent with a covetous and anxious de&s;ire after worldly riches, our Lord informs them that the&s;e things are directly contrary to each other. <HI>No man,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>can &s;erve two ma&s;ters; for either he will love the one and hate the other, or el&s;e he will hold to the one, and de&s;pi&s;e the other: ye cannot &s;erve God and mammon!</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord proceeded to enforce the heavenly doctrine by a&s;certaining the univer&s;ality of the providence of God, and his paternal care over the lea&s;t and meane&s;t of his crea|tures. <HI>Behold,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the fowls of the air: for they &s;ow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye much better than they?</HI> If the providence of God extends to the meane&s;t and mo&s;t in&s;ignificant of his creatures, and his wi&s;dom hath &s;o conducted his wide creation, that there is abundant provi&s;ion made for the fowls of the air, and the bea&s;ts of the field, &s;hall his creature man, whom he hath placed at the head of his lower creation, and made the object of his peculiar care, be over anxious and careful, or gloomy and di&s;contented for fear he &s;hould not be able to procure food and raiment? How unworthy is this of his &s;uperior rea&s;on, and how di&s;ho|nourable to his great Maker, and mo&s;t bountiful Benefactor! Thus the divine Teacher led the mo&s;t ignorant and illiterate of his hearers to entertain great and &s;ublime ideas of God and his providence; and gave them a more elevated and exten&s;ive view of the nature of his government than had been taught in the &s;chools of the philo&s;ophers: for
<PB N="50" REF="029927_0053_0FE336003678FA10">
though they believed that there was a God, and that he made and governed the world, they had but very dark and confu&s;ed notions of his particular providence, as it relates to the &s;tate of every individual in his creation. This, our great Redeemer gave them to under&s;tand, was fixed by the univer&s;al Governor, with more exactne&s;s and preci&s;ion, than was generally imagined, and le&s;s in the power of individuals to alter, by their utmo&s;t anxiety and care. <HI>Which of you,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>by taking thought, can add one cubit unto his &s;tature?</HI></P>
<P>THE illu&s;trious Preacher then proceeds from the animal, to the vegetable part of the crea|tion, and infers the ab&s;urdity of anxious and vexatious cares concerning raiment. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the great Being, who &s;pread fre&s;h verdure over the fields, and adorns them with tho&s;e flowers which &s;hine brighter than the golden embroidery which glitters on the purple robes of kings, will not provide raiment for his own people? Will he thus cloathe the inanimate, and neglect the noble&s;t part of his creation? <HI>Con&s;ider,</HI> &s;aid the exalted Redeemer, <HI>the lilies of the field, how they grow, they toil not, neither do they &s;pin; and yet I &s;ay unto you, that even Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of the&s;e. Wherefore, if God &s;o cloathe the gra&s;s of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is ca&s;t into the oven, &s;hall he not much more cloathe you, O ye of little faith?</HI> Let the&s;e con&s;iderations excite you, he adds, to be ea&s;y and quiet, patient and re&s;igned to the allotments of Providence. <HI>Seek fir&s;t the kingdom of God and his righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Make it your fir&s;t great concern, to pur&s;ue the intere&s;t of your im|mortal &s;ouls, and re&s;t not till you have obtained a rational and &s;criptural &s;atisfaction, that your eternal intere&s;t is &s;afe; and, when this great ble&s;&s;ing is obtained, be not anxious or vexatiou&s;ly careful concerning the things of time and &s;en&s;e, but re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that <HI>all the&s;e things,</HI> &s;o far as nece&s;&s;ary to your &s;upreme good, <HI>&s;hall be added unto you.</HI></P>
<P>THE exalted Redeemer, now drawing towards the conclu&s;ion of his di&s;cour&s;e, pro|ceeded to forbid all ra&s;h and uncharitable judgment, either with regard to the general characters, or particular actions of men. This is an evil of the mo&s;t atrocious kind; innocence and virtue often &s;uffer, and, however &s;orry the &s;landerer may be for the wrong done, the injury cannot be repaired. No character is more hurtful to &s;ociety, and no per&s;on more hateful to God and man, than the &s;landerer; and our Lord intimates that both God and man will re&s;ent the injury done to his creatures, <HI>Judge not,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that ye be not judged.</HI> If you judge charitably, &s;aid the kind and compa&s;&s;ionate, the meek and benevolent Saviour of mankind; if you make allowances for the frailty of human na|ture, and are ready to pity and pardon tho&s;e who have offended you, both your hea|venly Father, and your fellow-mortals will deal with you in the &s;ame manner. But if you are always ready to hear, and eager to &s;pread &s;landerous reports; if you put the har&s;he&s;t con&s;truction on every action: if you are plea&s;ed to hear of another's mi&s;conduct, or mi&s;fortunes, and never touched with the feeling of your brother's infirmities; if you take all opportunities to injure him in the opinion of mankind, or pur&s;ue him with inexo|rable and implacable re&s;entment; if you are a &s;tranger to mercy or forgivene&s;s, no mercy or forgivene&s;s will you find, either from offended Omnipotence, or injured and in&s;ulted man. <HI>For with what judgment ye judge, ye &s;hall be judged; and with what mea&s;ure ye mete, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to prevent mankind from pa&s;&s;ing ra&s;h and cen&s;orious judgment, our great Redeemer advi&s;es them to look unto them&s;elves; and if they would carefully advert to their own errors and failings, they would find le&s;s time, as well as le&s;s de&s;ire, to cen&s;ure the re&s;t of mankind. It frequently happens, that tho&s;e per&s;ons who are mo&s;t ready to cen&s;ure and condemn their fellow-creatures, and mo&s;t eager to &s;earch out, and expo&s;e the failings of others, are not the mo&s;t blamele&s;s them&s;elves: but frequently more cul|pable than the per&s;ons whom they are &s;o ready to accu&s;e. It is therefore with the
<PB N="51" REF="029927_0054_0FE33602F6C3E5C0">
highe&s;t rea&s;on that our great Redeemer exhorted his hearers to look unto them&s;elves, and carefully mend their own faults, which would be of greater &s;ervice to them, than endeavouring to expo&s;e and &s;candalize tho&s;e who are better than they. <HI>And why beholde&s;t thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, and con&s;idere&s;t not the beam that is in thine own eye: or how wilt thou &s;ay to thy brother; let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and behold, a beam is in thine own eye. Thou hypocrite, fir&s;t ca&s;t out the beam out of thine own eye, and then &s;halt thou &s;ee clearly to ca&s;t out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH are the &s;everal branches of moral righteou&s;ne&s;s inculcated by the Son of God; but &s;ome are &s;o perver&s;e in their di&s;po&s;itions, and &s;o ob&s;tinately attached to their evil practices and errors, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to reclaim them; and therefore our Saviour advi&s;es his followers not to attempt it: <HI>Give not,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that which is holy unto the dogs; neither ca&s;t ye your pearls before &s;wine, le&s;t they tread them under their feet, and turn again and rent you.</HI> La&s;tly, that it might not be &s;uppo&s;ed that the moral precepts of chri&s;tianity were above the attainment of mankind, our Lord proceeded to inform his hearers, how gracious, and full of compa&s;&s;ion, their heavenly Father was, and how ready to hear and a&s;&s;i&s;t all who called upon him; and in con&s;equence advi&s;ed them humbly to intreat his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and at the &s;ame time that they exerted their utmo&s;t endeavours to do his will, and be found in the way of his commandments. <HI>A&s;k,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and it &s;hall be given; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find; knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you: for every one that a&s;keth, receiveth; and he that &s;eeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it &s;hall be opened.</HI> Our Lord appeals to their own feelings towards their children, as an encouragement to be earne&s;t in their petitions to their heavenly Father: <HI>If ye being evil,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more &s;hall your Father, which is in heaven, give good things to them that a&s;k him?</HI> But, that they might not depend on the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance without the diligent exertion of their utmo&s;t endeavours, our Lord immediately adds, <HI>Enter ye in at the &s;traight gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to de&s;truction, and many there be which go in thereat; becau&s;e &s;traight is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth to life, and few there be that find it.</HI></P>
<P>THE illu&s;trious preacher, before he concluded his di&s;cour&s;e, proceeded to warn his hearers of fal&s;e prophets and teachers, who would come with fair pretences; but as their lives and conver&s;ations were not an&s;werable to their profe&s;&s;ion, nor honourable to the cau&s;e they e&s;pou&s;ed, they were to be de&s;pi&s;ed and di&s;regarded: <HI>Ye &s;hall know them by their fruits,</HI> &s;aid the divine teacher; <HI>do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thi&s;tles? Even &s;o every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</HI> It is not the pretences to extraordinary piety and goodne&s;s; it is not the mo&s;t flaming zeal, or the mo&s;t ardent devotion, that will compen&s;ate for a di&s;regard to the divine commands, or a departure from the unvariable rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s. <HI>It is not every one that &s;aith, Lord, Lord,</HI> &s;aid the exalted Saviour of mankind, <HI>&s;hall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</HI> And then he &s;ums up the whole, with a beautiful and &s;triking &s;imile, intended to demon|&s;trate the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a regard to the words of CHRIST, influenced the mind and determined the conduct in an univer&s;al and per&s;i&s;ting obedience: <HI>Therefore,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>who&s;oever heareth the&s;e &s;ayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wi&s;e man, which built his hou&s;e upon a rock; and the rain de&s;cended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and heat upon that hou&s;e, and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth the&s;e &s;ayings, of mine, and doeth them not, &s;hall be likened unto a fooli&s;h man, which built his hou&s;e upon the &s;and; and the rain de&s;cended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that hou&s;e, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</HI> Thus ended our Lord's excellent and admirable &s;ermon. The multitudes &s;tood around him

with the utmo&s;t attention and &s;urpri&s;e. The plain tokens of divinity which attended his di&s;cour&s;e, joined with his all-commanding eloquence, attracted every eye, and affected every heart: but what &s;urpri&s;ed them the more was, the difference of his doctrine from what they before had heard; <HI>for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the Scribes.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CHRIST</HI> having fini&s;hed his &s;ermon on the mount, repairs to Capernaum, and on his way there is met by a leprous per&s;on, whom he clean&s;es: On his entering the city, he is acco&s;ted by a Roman Centurion, who&s;e &s;ervant was ill of the pal&s;y, whom he heals: He afterwards repairs to the Synagogue on the Sabbath-day, where he di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth a devil: He cures Peter's wife's mother of a fever, and many other di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons: He travels through Galilee; and directs the di&s;ciples to take a great draught of fi&s;hes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE exalted Saviour of &s;inners, having fini&s;hed his &s;ermon, came down from the mountain, attended by a great concour&s;e of people, who had li&s;tened to his di&s;|cour&s;e, with the mixt emotions of wonder and joy. They &s;urrounded the divine per&s;on of our Redeemer, with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful regard, and &s;oon an incident aro&s;e which gave them fre&s;h cau&s;e of wonder and prai&s;e. As he was on his way to Capernaum, he was met by a leprous per&s;on, who, doubtle&s;s, having heard of his wonderful works, and the conde&s;cending goodne&s;s with which he relieved the afflicted and di&s;ea&s;ed, threw him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t humility at his feet, and cried, <HI>Lord, if thou wilt, thou can&s;t make me clean.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;pecies of lepro&s;y common among&s;t the Ea&s;tern nations, and the Jews, was very nau&s;eous and infectious, as well as extremely hard to be cured. Our Lord was not deterred by this, from approaching an object &s;o loath&s;ome; but, full of pity, he con|de&s;cended &s;o far as to touch him, with this reply, <HI>I will: be thou clean.</HI> The dire infection immediately fled before the touch of the Son of God; who charged the per&s;on, thus in&s;tantaneou&s;ly healed, not to publi&s;h the matter abroad, but go directly and &s;hew him&s;elf to the prie&s;t, offering, at the &s;ame time, the oblations which the law in &s;uch ca&s;es required.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS then proceeded to Capernaum, but as he entered the city, he was acco&s;ted by a Roman centurion, who with the care and tenderne&s;s of an indulgent ma&s;ter, informed him of the dreadful condition of his &s;ervant, who was afflicted with a paralytic di&s;order, and grievou&s;ly tormented with pain. The compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer of mankind, li&s;tened to his complaint with pitying attention, and replied to his addre&s;s, that he would come and heal him. The centurion thought this goodne&s;s too much to be expected by one who was not of the I&s;raeliti&s;h nation, and therefore told our Lord, that he was not worthy &s;o illu&s;trious a per&s;on &s;hould come under his roof; and he, very probably, having heard of the nobleman's &s;on, who, while he lay &s;ick at Capernaum, was healed by JESUS, when he was &s;o far off as Cana, de&s;ired our Lord only to &s;peak the word, and he doubted not but his &s;ervant would be healed; for he believed, that di&s;ea&s;es and devils were as much under the command of our Redeemer, as his &s;oldiers were &s;ubject to the will, and obeyed the word of their commander. Our Lord was well plea&s;ed with the centurion's faith, and commended it in the highe&s;t terms; <HI>I have not found,</HI> &s;aid be, <HI>&s;o great faith, no not in I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="029927_0056_0FE3360608F93DC0">THE believing &s;tranger, having applied the mo&s;t exalted ideas of the divine power and goodne&s;s to JESUS CHRIST, who appeared to be no more than a man, our Lord took occa&s;ion, from the open confe&s;&s;ion of his faith, to declare the gracious de&s;ign of his Almighty Father towards the Gentile world, and gave the &s;urrounding multitude to under&s;tand, that the divine goodne&s;s was not confined to the &s;eed of Abraham, nor to the land of I&s;rael: <HI>And I &s;ay unto you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that many &s;hall come from the Ea&s;t, and the We&s;t, and &s;hall &s;it down with Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.</HI> And having a clear view of the ob&s;tinacy, impenitence, and final unbelief of the Jewi&s;h nation, he added, <HI>But the children of the kingdom &s;hall be ca&s;t out into outer darkne&s;s: there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth.</HI> Having thus &s;poken to the li&s;tening throng, our Lord directed his di&s;cour&s;e to the centurion, and &s;aid, <HI>Go thy way; and as thou ha&s;t be|lieved, &s;o be it done unto thee;</HI> and immediately the &s;ervant was healed.</P>
<P>ON the next Sabbath day, JESUS went to the Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue at Capernaum, and in&s;tructed the people with &s;uch energy and power, and at the &s;ame time, with &s;uch re|markable plainne&s;s and &s;implicity, that the congregation heard him with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure and &s;urpri&s;e: and to increa&s;e their admiration, there was a per&s;on in the a&s;&s;embly, that was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an unclean and wicked &s;pirit, who cried out in the mo&s;t dreadful manner: <HI>Let us alone, what have we to do with thee, thou Je&s;us of Nazareth? Art thou come to de&s;troy us? I know thee, who thou art, the Holy one of God.</HI> But the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, who wanted no &s;uch te&s;timony, commanded him to keep &s;ilence, and immediately come out of the man; this command, the wicked &s;pirit dur&s;t not di&s;obey, and directly com|plied, leaving the di&s;ordered per&s;on, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the whole congregation.</P>
<P>IT is con&s;tantly alledged, by tho&s;e who are enemies to our religion, and delight to cavil with the conduct of our Redeemer, and depreciate his mighty deeds, that the per&s;ons, who are &s;aid in the go&s;pels to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by devils, were only affected by &s;ome &s;trange and unaccountable di&s;orders; and becau&s;e &s;epulchres were e&s;teemed polluted places, the melancholy per&s;ons who frequented them, were &s;aid to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the devil. And the adver&s;aries of our religion, are fond of inquiring, why there &s;hould be any more demons in Judea, than in any other country.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e objections it may, with great certainty be replied, that the&s;e daemoniacs were not per&s;ons affected only with &s;ome uncommon and dreadful di&s;ea&s;e; for the evan|geli&s;ts have taken care to be very particular on that head: and being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the devil, is carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from any other affliction and complaint: St. Matthew tells us, that, <HI>They brought unto Chri&s;t, all &s;ick people, that were taken with divers di&s;ea&s;es, and tho&s;e that were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with devils, and tho&s;e that were Lunatic; and he healed them,</HI> chap. iv. ver. 24. And again, chap. x. ver. i. <HI>He gave to the apo&s;tles power again&s;t evil &s;pirits, to ca&s;t them out, and to heal all manner of &s;ickne&s;&s;es and di&s;ea&s;es.</HI> And we are informed by St. Mark, chap. i.34. <HI>That they healed many that were &s;ick of divers di&s;ea&s;es, and ca&s;t out devils.</HI> There is in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages a plain di&s;tinction between tho&s;e who were &s;ick of various di&s;ea&s;es, and tho&s;e who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with devils; and this being di&s;tinctly noticed by the evan|geli&s;ts, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that there were not plain, evident marks of di&s;tinction, which made the cure &s;o manife&s;t, that there was no danger of being deceived.</P>
<P>AND it may further be ob&s;erved, to tho&s;e who doubt of the exi&s;tence of evil &s;pirits, that they cannot entertain &s;uch doubts without que&s;tioning the truth of the Holy &s;crip|tures; for the &s;acred writers have laid down &s;everal particulars concerning the&s;e impi|ous and envious beings; they have taken care to acquaint us with their original and fall, their names and numbers, their government and orders, their malicious de&s;igns,
<PB N="54" REF="029927_0057_0FE3361294E79FA0">
and various of their employments; and it is abundantly evident, both from &s;acred and prophane hi&s;tory, that before our Saviour's a&s;cen&s;ion, there were great numbers of per|&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with evil &s;pirits. The&s;e evil &s;pirits had gained &s;o great an a&s;cendancy, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o large a part of the world, that they reviled the great Creator in his wor&s;hip; and in &s;everal Heathen nations, there were oracles which were applied to, in order to re&s;olve the doubts, and an&s;wer the inquiries of their wor&s;hippers. And as the de&s;ign of our Lord's incarnation, and his whole mini&s;try, was <HI>to de&s;troy the works of the devil;</HI> perhaps, the rea&s;on why the&s;e apo&s;tate &s;pirits were &s;o frequently permitted to appear in Judea at this time, was, that the Son of God might, in a more manife&s;t and triumphant manner, di&s;play his authority and power over the prince of dark|ne&s;s, and all his infernal legions, and thereby convince the wondering world, that he was really the Son of God, and the Saviour of mankind.</P>
<P>THE fame of this miracle was &s;oon &s;pread over the neighbouring country. Our Re|deemer had healed the &s;ick, and done various wonderful works, which had excited the ad|miration of the people, and rai&s;ed their expectations of &s;omething very great and advan|tageous to the Jewi&s;h nation, to ari&s;e from &s;o extraordinary a per&s;on. But when the people beheld him, in the public a&s;&s;embly, with a commanding authority, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the devil, and drive the powers of darkne&s;s before him; their a&s;toni&s;hment increa&s;ed, and they acknowledged that this was <HI>the mighty power of God.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord having performed this miracle in the &s;ynagogue, he departed to Peter's hou&s;e, who&s;e wife's mother law &s;ick of a fever: he took her by the hand, and immedi|ately the fever left her; and &s;o perfectly was &s;he re&s;tored to her former health, that <HI>&s;he aro&s;e and mini&s;tered unto him.</HI> The evangeli&s;t Luke, in his account of this wonderful cure, &s;ays that <HI>he rebuked the fever;</HI> which is a figurative way of &s;peaking, conformable to the language of the Scriptures, where not only the inanimate parts of the creation, but di&s;ea&s;es, famine, pe&s;tilence, and the like, are per&s;onated and repre&s;ented as the &s;er|vants of the almighty, to execute his vengeance on rebellious &s;inners: hence, &s;ays the prephet, <HI>before him went the pe&s;tilence: and burning di&s;ea&s;es went forth at his feet.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord being grown popular, and famed through the city of Capernaum, for the authority and eloquence of his teaching, and the manifold wonders which he wrought, va&s;t numbers of people re&s;orted to him while he abode at Peter's hou&s;e, and brought with him great numbers of &s;ick per&s;ons, and tho&s;e who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with devils. The kind and compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour of the world, was touched with pity at the &s;ight of &s;o many di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and afflicted objects; when he immediately healed them all, and fulfilled, by his exten&s;ive all-relieving goodne&s;s, the prophecy of I&s;aiah, which &s;ays, <HI>He him&s;elf took our infirmities, and bare our &s;ickne&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the va&s;t crowds of people, who now gathered about him in Capernaum, were not ea&s;ily to be borne, and to avoid the trouble&s;ome pre&s;s, our Redeemer retired to the de&s;ert, whither he was &s;oon followed by great multitudes of people, who were &s;o de|lighted with his in&s;tructions, and had conceived &s;o high an opinion of him, from his kind conde&s;cen&s;ion, and his many wonderful works, that they de&s;ired him never to depart from them. But this reque&s;t being incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of his mini&s;try, and the great de&s;ign of his coming into the world, he departed from the de&s;ert, <HI>and preached in the &s;ynagogues of Galilee;</HI> and after he had proceeded through various cities of that country, he returned to Capernaum.</P>
<P>WHEN our great Redeemer was known to be returned to the city, he was &s;oon &s;urrounded by great multitudes of people; &s;o that he was forced to retire into a &s;hip, which being
<PB N="55" REF="029927_0058_0FE33614197BD590">
a little way from the &s;hore, the divine In&s;tructor taught them from thence, while the attentive multitude crowded the &s;ea-&s;ide, and li&s;tened with great attention to his hea|venly words.</P>
<P>WHEN he had fini&s;hed his di&s;cour&s;e, he turned to Peter, who was the owner of the ve&s;&s;el, and advi&s;ed him to launch out further from the &s;hore, and let down his fi&s;hing net into the &s;ea. Peter informed him of their un&s;ucce&s;sful toil during the night, but &s;aid, at his command, they would let down their net and make one trial more. Accor|dingly, they ca&s;t into the water, and immediately found that their net had enclo&s;ed &s;o prodigious a number of large fi&s;h, that it was in danger of breaking. Peter &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;o &s;trange a turn, and &s;uch an unexpected &s;ucce&s;s, and knowing it mu&s;t be produced by a &s;upernatural power, fell down at JESUS's feet. <HI>Depart from me,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>for I am a &s;inful man, O Lord!</HI> He was convinced, by this miracle, of the divinity of his ma&s;ter, and was at that time impre&s;&s;ed with awe from a &s;en&s;e of his own unworthine&s;s: but the all-gracious Saviour of mankind bid him bani&s;h his fears, and informed him, that hence|forth him&s;elf and his companions &s;hould be engaged in more noble employments. Our Lord declared that they &s;hould catch men, meaning, that they &s;hould be made in&s;tru|mental in turning them from darkne&s;s to light, and from &s;in and Satan to the know|ledge of God.</P>
<P>THIS miracle was con&s;idered, by the di&s;ciples of CHRIST, as a fuller and plainer manife&s;tation of his divine power, and a clearer evidence of his being the Son of God, than tho&s;e they had &s;een him perform in Capernaum and the adjacent country. It was the common opinion among&s;t the Jews, that good men, by their prayers, might pre|vail &s;o far with the almighty Governor of the world, as to heal the &s;ick and ca&s;t out devils; but they concluded that the creatures inhabiting the elements of the air or water, were &s;ubject only to the commands of our great Creator: and as he never granted to man an authority over the&s;e, the miracle which our Saviour had ju&s;t wrought, proved him to be the Son of God, and the great Me&s;&s;iah; and accordingly this manife&s;tation of divine power, fully convinced the di&s;ciples of the divinity of their ma&s;ter, and all they, without he&s;itation, joined in the re&s;olution to follow him through the world.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CHRIST</HI> clean&s;eth a &s;econd leper: He rebukes the &s;torm and calms the &s;ea: He ca&s;teth out the Legion of Devils, and &s;uffereth them to enter into an Herd of Swine: He cures a Per&s;on who had long been afflicted with the Pal&s;y: And calls Matthew, who was &s;itting at the Receipt of Cu&s;tom.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE di&s;ciples now having every &s;cruple removed, and being fully convinced that their ma&s;ter was the Me&s;&s;iah, left their employment and followed him, while ac|cording to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, he went through various cities of Galilee, preaching the go&s;pel of the kingdom of God, and confirming his divine doctrines, with the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing miracles.</P>
<P>IN one of the cities which he vi&s;ited on this occa&s;ion, he found a man, &s;aid by the evangeli&s;t, to be <HI>full of lepro&s;y, who, &s;eeing Je&s;us, fell on his face, and be&s;ought him, &s;aying, Lord, if thou wilt thou can&s;t make me clean.</HI> It was the cu&s;tom of the prie&s;ts in Judea to drive from the conver&s;ation of mankind, tho&s;e per&s;ons who were infected with the con|tagious kind of lepro&s;y; and as this per&s;on was permitted to dwell in the city, it may
<PB N="56" REF="029927_0059_0FE336159D23EE30">
be &s;uppo&s;ed that his lepro&s;y was not of the wor&s;t kind. His ca&s;e however, excited the compa&s;&s;ion of our great Redeemer, who immediately clean&s;ed him, and commanded him to depart to Jeru&s;alem, and &s;hew him&s;elf to the prie&s;t, and offer the cu&s;tomary gifts; but not publi&s;h abroad the account of his cure, nor make any noi&s;e about it. But the ble&s;|&s;ing which the poor man had received, was &s;o great and unexpected, that his heart was &s;o full of gratitude and joy, that he could not contain it; and he publi&s;hed the great things which our Lord had done for him, to all men where ever he came. This brought &s;uch crowds of people to the Son of God, that he was obliged to depart from Capernaum into the wilderne&s;s, where he &s;pent &s;ome time in retirement, meditation, and prayer.</P>
<P>SOME writers have &s;uppo&s;ed that this leper, and the other mentioned in the foregoing chapter, were one and the &s;ame per&s;on; but this mu&s;t be a mi&s;take, the former being clean&s;ed in the fields, the latter in the city: after clean&s;ing the fir&s;t, JESUS went to Capernaum and healed the centurion's &s;ervant; after curing the latter, JESUS retired into the wilderne&s;s, to &s;hun the va&s;t multitudes which &s;oon gathered round him, from the leper being &s;o careful to proclaim to all men the miracles which JESUS had wrought.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it may &s;eem &s;trange that the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS &s;hould be &s;o careful to conceal his wondrous works, and be looked upon in &s;ome mea&s;ure, contrary to the end for which they were performed, which mu&s;t certainly be to prove his divine mi&s;&s;ion. But it may be ob&s;erved, that his mode&s;ty and humility would not allow his works to have the lea&s;t ap|pearance of o&s;tentation; nor the Jews to have the lea&s;t pretence of accu&s;ing him of &s;eeking his own glory, or aiming at popular applau&s;e.</P>
<P>AND it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that our great Redeemer did not think it proper, at this time, to irritate the Scribes and Phari&s;ees by the proclamation and publication of his miracles through the kingdom. He very well knew that at the appointed time they would perform whatever had been determined, concerning him, in the councils of heaven. In the mean time, he was to work the works of him that &s;ent him, and proclaim his go&s;pel among&s;t mankind. This he knew could not be &s;o conveniently performed if the fame of his miracles had rou&s;ed the rage of his enemies, and excited their malice and envy to exert their utmo&s;t power again&s;t him. He likewi&s;e was &s;en&s;ible of the unruly humour of the multitude; they were convinced that he was the Me&s;&s;iah; they had no further views than a temporal reign; and he might be apprehen&s;ive that they would <HI>come by force and make him king,</HI> if the fame of his miracles blazed abroad before he had informed them of the &s;piritual nature of his kingdom. If &s;uch were his views, there was the greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ity to keep his miracles concealed as much as po&s;&s;ible. The fame of his clean&s;ing the la&s;t leper had brought &s;uch numbers of people to Capernaum, that he was forced to retire into a &s;olitary retreat in the neighbouring de&s;art: nor could he even in this retirement long enjoy the repo&s;e he &s;ought; for the people &s;oon found out the place of his retreat, and flocked to him in great numbers from every part of the country.</P>
<P>OUR Lord finding his endeavours to conceal him&s;elf in the wilderne&s;s would be in vain, he ordered his di&s;ciples to accompany him to the other &s;ide of the lake. A cer|tain Scribe, who happened to be among&s;t the company, declared that he would follow him whither&s;oever he went; JESUS, who well knew that his only de&s;ire was to gain the profits and honour of that temporal kingdom which he &s;uppo&s;ed the Me&s;&s;iah would e&s;tabli&s;h, told him, that if he wanted nothing more than to advance and improve his worldly fortune, he would be greatly deceived; for the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS informed this teacher of I&s;rael, <HI>That the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have ne&s;ts, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="029927_0060_0FE33617222DDCD8">THE Son of Man is a name by which the Me&s;&s;iah is called in the prophecy of Daniel, where his wide and exten&s;ive dominion is de&s;cribed; and therefore when this title is ap|plied to our Lord, it hath reference to his human nature, and at the &s;ame time conveys an idea of that glorious kingdom to which his manhood will be exalted. But as it was al&s;o a name by which the old prophets were called by way of contempt, it is u&s;ed in &s;everal places to expre&s;s the deep humiliation of the Son of God.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples having provided a &s;hip, took their Ma&s;ter on board, and cro&s;&s;ed the lake, being followed by &s;everal boats full of people, who were de&s;irous of hearing his heavenly di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;eeing the wonderful works which he con&s;tantly performed. Our Lord, being fatigued with the labour of the day, fell a&s;leep in the &s;hip, while &s;he &s;moothly glided along the level &s;eas.</P>
<P>But &s;oon the weather, which till now had been calm and &s;erene, changed, black clouds covered the &s;kies, and the big &s;torm bur&s;t from the dark concave of heaven, the winds roared aloud, and the white foam appeared on the face of the waves; the &s;hip could &s;carce bear the da&s;hing tides, which beat ince&s;&s;antly again&s;t her; the darkne&s;s of the night increa&s;ed the horrors of the tempe&s;t; the waves began to break over the &s;hip, and &s;he was in the utmo&s;t danger of &s;inking. All hopes of being &s;aved were lo&s;t, and in the agonies of de&s;pair the di&s;ciples ran to JESUS, crying, <HI>Ma&s;ter, Ma&s;ter, we peri&s;h!</HI> This pitious exclamation awakened him from his &s;leep, and rai&s;ing that hand, &s;o often em|ployed in acts of benevolence and mercy, he with an awful all-commanding voice, re|buked the boi&s;terous ocean. The elements knew his voice; the roaring winds for&s;ook the &s;eas; and the foaming waves &s;ub&s;ided. All was quiet, all was &s;till, and the &s;hip &s;moothly cut the &s;miling deep, &s;oon arriving at her de&s;tined port.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples, before this, had &s;een our Lord perform many miracles, and had abun|dant rea&s;on to rely on his power and goodne&s;s. They had certainly no cau&s;e to be &s;o much affrighted, or to give way to &s;uch de&s;pair and terror: they might have con&s;idered, that the &s;ame divine per&s;on who had &s;o often healed the &s;ick, and had lately &s;hewn &s;uch power over the watry element, as to bring the fi&s;h to their nets, was equally able to &s;tay the wild waves, or to have pre&s;erved them alive, had the &s;hip &s;unk beneath them: but they &s;eemed, in the hurry of mind con&s;equent on the terrors of the &s;torm, to have forgot the power of their ma&s;ter, and therefore he gently rebuked them, <HI>Why are ye &s;o fearful! How is it that ye have no faith?</HI> They ought to have remembered likewi&s;e, that the voyage was undertaken at his command, and it was not to be feared, that he would permit them to peri&s;h: but when the terror of the &s;torm was over, they wondered at his power, and though they frequently had occa&s;ion to remark the effects of his heavenly goodne&s;s, they exclaimed, <HI>What manner of man is this! that even the winds and the &s;ea obey him.</HI></P>
<P>SOON after the &s;torm was &s;tilled, the &s;hip arrived in the country of Gadara; and on their landing, two men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with devils, came to meet our Redeemer. They were both exceeding fierce, turbulent, and unruly; but one of them was more furious than the other: this per&s;on had often been bound with chains and fetters, but all in vain, for his fetters were always broken with the greate&s;t fury, &s;o that no man attempted any longer to re&s;train him; being therefore at full liberty, he &s;hunned all human &s;ociety, and wandered day and night, in de&s;ert and dry places, and among&s;t the &s;epulchres and tombs, filling the &s;ilent repo&s;itories of the dead, with the mo&s;t di&s;mal and horrid howlings, and &s;ometimes tearing his fle&s;h, and cutting him&s;elf with &s;tones.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="029927_0061_0FE336208A4B21C0">THE di&s;ciples were very much alarmed and terrified at the approach of the&s;e horrid and furious beings, but JESUS &s;oon quieted their apprehen&s;ions of danger, by command|ing the devils to come out of the men, while they were at &s;ome di&s;tance. The heavenly command had no &s;ooner pa&s;&s;ed from the lips of our great Redeemer, than the men fell on their faces crying, <HI>What have we to do with thee Je&s;us, thou Son of the mo&s;t high God? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time? I adjure thee, by God, that thou torment us not.</HI> The infernal &s;pirits were not ignorant of the power of the Son of God, and were afraid, that he would ca&s;t them immediately into the torments prepared for them, and &s;uffer them no longer to wander about the earth, which they &s;eem to have hoped would be permitted them, till the judgment of the great day.</P>
<P>JESUS, being willing that the torment of the&s;e mi&s;erable men &s;hould be the more under|&s;tood, a&s;ked one of the daemons his name, who immediately an&s;wered, <HI>my name is Legion, for we are many:</HI> at the &s;ame time, he humbly reque&s;ted, that our Lord would not immediately ca&s;t them into the ultimate torments prepared for them in the great deep of bottomle&s;s perdition, but would permit them to enter into an herd of &s;wine, then feeding on a neighbouring mountain.</P>
<P>The grand deceiver of mankind, no doubt, beheld with gnawing envy, the effects of our Redeemer's power and goodne&s;s; and to abate the opinion which the inhabitants of Gadara might form of him, and make him odious in their view, &s;eems to be the rea&s;on of his petition to enter into the &s;wine; for doubtle&s;s the Devil knew, that if his legion could gain this permi&s;&s;ion, it would be in their power to de&s;troy them; but though his &s;ecret de&s;igns could not be hid from the Saviour of the world, yet ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lord was plea&s;ed to grant to the fiend, the permi&s;&s;ion he de&s;ired: perhaps this might be complied with, to give the di&s;ciples a full proof that the&s;e per&s;ons were really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with devils, and to give a terrible in&s;tance of the power of the&s;e malicious beings when free from re&s;traint.</P>
<P>THE commi&s;&s;ion was no &s;ooner granted, than the devils for&s;ook the men, and, &s;wift a|lightning, &s;eized their bri&s;tly prey. The whole herd were immediately in a tumult, and the torments the poor creatures &s;uffered, were plainly perceived by the &s;pectators at a di&s;tance; the keepers were affrighted, and found it impo&s;&s;ible to calm or re&s;train the wild fury of the herd; they poured, with amazing rapidity, down the mountain's &s;ide, and approaching the confines of the lake, leaped from the rocks and precipices into the &s;ea, and the whole herd <HI>peri&s;hed in the waters.</HI> The per&s;ons, who but a moment before, were roaring, raving, and cutting them&s;elves, were now become calm and compo&s;ed; they were become mild and gentle, having recovered the u&s;e of their rea&s;on, and being now proper members of &s;ociety, they, doubtle&s;s, believed in the Son of God.</P>
<P>THE keepers of the herd, a&s;toni&s;hed at this &s;urpri&s;ing event, ran into the city, in the utmo&s;t terror and amazement, and related the cure of the men who had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with devils, and the de&s;truction of the &s;wine. This wonderful report, threw the whole city into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, and the inhabitants in crowds, left their hou&s;es, to be &s;pectators of the &s;trange event. They &s;aw the men &s;itting at the feet of JESUS, and in their right minds; but as they were con&s;cious of having committed a tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t the law of Mo&s;es, by keeping &s;uch numbers of &s;wine, which were &s;trictly forbid to be eaten, they were afraid, and &s;eemed to expect &s;ome &s;everer judgment: they might have been convinced of the goodne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion of the great per&s;on who had performed the&s;e wonders, by the cure of the men; but they were afraid, and meekly be&s;ought our Lord to depart from their country.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="029927_0062_0FE3362262BF3BB0">THE &s;tupid Gadarines, had they known how great a benefit they might have received by attending on the illu&s;trious per&s;on who had worked &s;uch wonders among&s;t them, would not have been &s;o cruel to them&s;elves, as to have pre&s;ented &s;uch a petition. It is true they had lo&s;t their &s;wine, but had received two of their countrymen and fellow-creatures; the&s;e happy men were delivered from the power of the Devil, and their country was freed from &s;o intolerable a burden; and the benefit they might have received to their &s;ouls, by attending on our great Redeemer and hearing his words, would have been of greater value than the <HI>cattle on a thou&s;and hills.</HI></P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, however, thought fit to comply with the reque&s;t of the fooli&s;h Gardarines, and &s;oon returned to the country from whence he came. The per&s;ons who were happily delivered from the power of the Devil, de&s;ired to accompany him, but our Lord ordered them to remain in their own country, as a &s;tanding monument of his divine power and goodne&s;s: <HI>Go home to thy friends,</HI> &s;aid our exalted Redeemer to one of them, <HI>and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compa&s;&s;ion on thee.</HI></P>
<P>IT may be remarked on this miracle, that here we have a fuller di&s;play of the tyranny and power of the Devil, than in any other part of Scripture; and therefore it is fit to be recommended to the &s;erious attention of tho&s;e infidels, who, like the Sadducees, will not believe in the exi&s;tence of &s;pirits, and &s;coff at the power of the Devil. Let &s;uch per&s;ons behold the picture of the&s;e unhappy men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the devils, as drawn by the evangeli&s;ts: they were driven from their abodes, and from the &s;ociety of men; one of them was &s;o fierce that he could not be confined, but broke chains of iron like a burnt thread, and fetters like rotten wood; he frequented the mo&s;t &s;olitary places, and filled the de&s;ert with more dreadful howlings, than the wild bea&s;ts; he dwelt among&s;t the tombs, and abode in the di&s;mal and &s;olitary man&s;ions of the dead, forlorn and naked, crying out day and night, cutting him&s;elf with &s;tones, and tearing his own fle&s;h.</P>
<P>IF &s;uch per&s;ons would give them&s;elves time to con&s;ider this dreadful repre&s;entation of human mi&s;ery, &s;urely their &s;coffs would be changed into compa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e unhappy creatures, and fearful apprehen&s;ions for them&s;elves; &s;urely they would no longer &s;coff at the power of the Devil, nor the pains of eternal damnation. It would certainly be more worthy the &s;uperior wi&s;dom they boa&s;t of, to be cautious and diffident; they are men, and &s;urely they will allow, that it is po&s;&s;ible they may be mi&s;taken: and when their eternal intere&s;t is at &s;take, one would think they might conde&s;cend to con&s;ider. But if they will deride, and &s;till per&s;i&s;t in their unbelief, a &s;hort &s;pace of time will convince them of their fatal error; and dreadful experience, force them to confe&s;s the greatne&s;s of the tyranny, and the bitterne&s;s of the malice, of this prince of darkne&s;s, again&s;t the &s;ouls of men. May they &s;ee the error of their conduct, and be enabled, by the Divine Spirit, &s;incerely to repent of their evil thoughts, and perver&s;e ways, and &s;eek the things which belong to their eternal peace.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, with his di&s;ciples, being landed in Galilee, he &s;oon repaired to Capernaum; no &s;ooner was his arrival known, than great multitudes re&s;orted to him; the hou&s;e where he was could not contain them, nor even the court before the door. He preached the doctrines and duties of his go&s;pel to the li&s;tening throng, among&s;t whom where many Phari&s;ees and doctors of the law, whom the fame of his miracles had brought from di&s;tant countries to behold his per&s;on, and hear his words.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="029927_0063_0FE33623E87EAB30">HE not only, by his preaching, repre&s;ented the great precepts and principles of his religion, in a plain and &s;triking point of light, but worked &s;uch miracles among&s;t them, as were &s;ufficient to convince every judicious, unprejudiced, and impartial inquirer after truth, of his divine mi&s;&s;ion; and he proved him&s;elf to be the Son of God, by tho&s;e illu&s;trious and benevolent actions, which God only could perform.</P>
<P>AMONGST many other in&s;tances of his almighty power and God like benevolence, was that of his re&s;toring a per&s;on to perfect health, who had long been afflicted with the pal&s;y, and was reduced by that deplorable di&s;order, to the mo&s;t melancholy and di&s;|tre&s;sful condition: he was unable to move any member of his body, and was become an helple&s;s bundle of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s. In this deplorable condition, he was carried in his bed, with de&s;ign to have petitioned our Lord to take pity on his di&s;tre&s;s, and exert that healing power, for which he was &s;o remarkable in his relief. The multitudes who &s;urrounded our Lord, had filled the hou&s;e, and pre&s;&s;ed &s;o clo&s;e, that it was impo&s;|&s;ible to bring the &s;ick per&s;on into his pre&s;ence. The per&s;ons that carried this mi&s;era|ble object, perceiving the difficulty which attended their de&s;ign, took the lame man to the top of the hou&s;e, lying in his bed. The hou&s;es in Judea had flat roofs, with battle|ments round them, according to the command of the law, Deut. xxii.8. on the&s;e roofs there was a kind of trap-door, by which they came up from the hou&s;e upon the roof, where they &s;pent a con&s;iderable part of the day. It was al&s;o common to have a flight of &s;tairs from the garden to the roof of the hou&s;e, by which the per&s;ons who carried the &s;ick mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have a&s;cended. When they came to the roof, they found the door &s;hut: but being re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to compa&s;s their de&s;ign, they uncovered the roof, and by ropes let down the &s;ick of the pal&s;y, lying on his bed, into the mid&s;t of the company before JESUS. Our Redeemer &s;eeing the faith of the friends of the afflicted per&s;on, had compa&s;&s;ion on him, and &s;pake aloud, <HI>Son be of good cheer, thy &s;ins are forgiven thee.</HI></P>
<P>THESE words gave great offence to the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, who &s;aid in their hearts, <HI>This man &s;peaketh bla&s;phemy;</HI> for he takes to him&s;elf that which belongs only to his ma|ker. <HI>Who can forgive &s;ins but God only?</HI> They were ignorant of the high dignity of the per&s;on who pronounced the words, and they murmured again&s;t him in their hearts. But JESUS, who knew what pa&s;&s;ed in the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of their minds, was willing to let them under&s;tand that he was endued with the Spirit of God; and to convince them that he knew their thoughts, he &s;aid unto them. <HI>Why think ye evil in your hearts? For whether is it ea&s;ier to &s;ay to the &s;ick of the pal&s;y, Thy &s;ins be forgiven thee, or to &s;ay, Ari&s;e, take up thy bed and walk?</HI> By the&s;e words our Lord might have convinced them that he had really a right to forgive &s;ins; for certainly it mu&s;t be ea&s;ier to forgive &s;ins, than to remove the puni&s;hment which is inflicted on men for &s;in. As therefore it was appa|rent our Lord had power to perform the latter, why &s;hould it be que&s;tioned whether he had a right to pronounce the former; but the&s;e haughty teachers of I&s;rael cheri&s;hed a gloomy rancour in their hearts, and, frowning, held their peace. Our Lord then turned to the di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on, and &s;aid, <HI>Ari&s;e, take up thy bed, and go unto thine hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>NO &s;ooner had our great Redeemer &s;poken the&s;e words, than the di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on was perfectly re&s;tored to his former health and &s;trength; and, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the &s;urrounding multitude, aro&s;e, took up his bed, and departed to his own hou&s;e, prai&s;ing and glorifying God; while the affected beholders, with the highe&s;t acclama|tions, joined the prai&s;e, and glorified the God of I&s;real, <HI>who had given &s;uch power unto man;</HI> but the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, however confounded they were at the miracle, &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in their unbelief; an in&s;tance which &s;hould fill us with the mo&s;t &s;erious thoughts,
<PB N="61" REF="029927_0064_0FE336256EB588E8">
as it demon&s;trates that a pride of heart, which produces an haughty &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, and generates an ob&s;tinate and determined hatred and oppo&s;ition to the truth, and by &s;u&s;pend|ing and &s;tupifying all the noble powers of the &s;oul, operates like the pal&s;y of the mind, is a much more dreadful and deplorable di&s;ea&s;e than the pal&s;y of the body.</P>
<P>OUR adorable Redeemer having performed this miracle, he departed to the &s;ea-&s;ide; and a multitude of people gathering about him, he made u&s;e of the favourable oppor|tunity to enlighten their dark minds with the rays of heavenly truth. What were the particular points he cho&s;e, the evangeli&s;ts have not informed us; but we may &s;afely con|clude that the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, like the re&s;t delivered by this divine per&s;on, were worthy of God and advantageous to man.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour having fini&s;hed his di&s;cour&s;e, he returned to the city of Caper|naum, and going by the keys where the goods which were brought by &s;ea from various nations were landed, he &s;aw Matthew, a rich publican, &s;itting in his office to receive the cu&s;toms; Matthew is &s;ometimes in the go&s;pels called Levi, and was the &s;on of Alpheus. CHRIST no &s;ooner &s;aw him than he called him. <HI>Follow me,</HI> was his mild and gracious language; which the heavenly teacher had no &s;ooner &s;poken, than the wealthy publican felt a divine power warm his heart, which overpowering every worldly con&s;ide|ration, he &s;eems to have left his acounts all unfini&s;hed, and immediately obeyed. He &s;oon, by our great Redeemer, was led into a more honourable and important employment, and afterwards became an evangeli&s;t, as well as an apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>A few days after this, the new called publican made a great entertainment, to which he, with CHRIST and his di&s;ciples, invited &s;everal of his own profe&s;&s;ion; no doubt hoping that his heavenly conver&s;ation might &s;trike their hard hearts with remor&s;e for their wickedne&s;s and extortion, and lead them in paths worthy of partaking the benefits ari&s;ing from the glorious Redeemer of mankind. In the cour&s;e of the entertainment CHRIST reminded them that in the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, God <HI>will have mercy, and not &s;acrifice;</HI> and as tho&s;e who confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves &s;inners were the only proper objects of that mercy, our Lord declared that he was <HI>not come to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance;</HI> and to blame him for conver&s;ing with publicans and &s;inners was as great a piece of ab&s;urdity as to blame a phy&s;ician for vi&s;iting the &s;ick. This declaration from the great friend and Redeemer of lo&s;t &s;inners, di&s;&s;atisfied greatly the haughty &s;elf conceited Scribes and Phari&s;ees: and as they made great o&s;tentation of their fa&s;ting and ab&s;tinence, they took this opportunity to give them&s;elves con&s;equence on that account; and joining with John's di&s;ciples, pre&s;umed to blame our great Redeemer becau&s;e his di&s;ciples were not &s;o frequent in this practice as them&s;elves. To this our Lord replied, that the pre&s;ent was not a time for fa&s;ting, for his di&s;ciples need not fa&s;t and mourn in the pre&s;ence of their ma&s;ter, any more than the friends of the bridegroom need fa&s;t and afflict them&s;elves while they enjoyed his company. <HI>But,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>the day will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they &s;hall fa&s;t.</HI> Intimating by this, that the calamities, troubles, and afflictions which they would &s;uffer after the death of their ma&s;ter, would oblige them to fa&s;t and mourn; but the corrupt nature of man, which was the cau&s;e of his coming into the world, required different treatment; the rent would not be patched up with mortification, fa&s;ting or any external performances; &s;uch treatment as this would be like &s;ewing a piece of new cloth on an old rotten garment, which would only make the rent wor&s;e; or putting new wine into old leather bottles, which would bur&s;t as &s;oon as the liquor fermented.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CHRIST</HI> healeth a Woman of an inveterate I&s;&s;ue of Blood: Rai&s;es Jarius's Daughter from the Dead: Gives Sight to two blind Men: Delivered a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Per&s;on from the evil Spirit: And, returning to Galilee, choo&s;es his twelve Apo&s;tles out of his Di&s;ciples: Then, repairing to Capernaum, cures the Centurion's Servant.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS was di&s;puting with the Scribes and Phari&s;ees in the hou&s;e of Matthew, whom he had lately called into the number of his di&s;ciples, an afflicted father, in all the agonies of di&s;tre&s;s, ha&s;tily pre&s;&s;ed into his pre&s;ence. This was Jarius, the ruler of the Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue in Capernaum, and the cau&s;e his pre&s;ent affliction was the dangerous illne&s;s of his daughter, who lay at the point of death.</P>
<P>HAVING earne&s;tly implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our great Redeemer in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ca&s;e, the Lord of life graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to comply with his reque&s;t, and accordingly ac|companied the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed father to his hou&s;e; and great multitudes of people, who were de&s;irous of beholding the miracles of Chri&s;t, crowded around and pre&s;&s;ed to behold what the divine In&s;tructor would do on this great occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But as they pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;treets of the city, the attention of the &s;urrounding multitudes were turned to a woman, who came behind the Son of God, and touched the hem of his garment. This woman had been afflicted twelve years with a terrible di&s;order, which had baffled the force of medicine. She had &s;pent her whole &s;ub&s;tance on phy|&s;icians, but could obtain no relief; but hearing of the miracles performed by the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, &s;he was &s;o fully convinced of his divine power, that &s;he concluded if &s;he could but touch his clothes &s;he &s;hould be made whole. Nor was &s;he deceived, for &s;he no &s;ooner touched the border of the garment of our great Redeemer, than the i&s;&s;ue of blood dried up; and &s;he felt &s;uch a flow of vital &s;pirits, and uncommon gladne&s;s warm her heart, that &s;he was fully convinced that &s;he had received a cure.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, who knew the heart of all men, was not ignorant of the minute&s;t circum&s;tances attending this affair; he knew the woman's thoughts, and was plea&s;ed with her faith: and with de&s;ign to begin a conver&s;ation in which he might te&s;tify his approbation, he turned about and a&s;ked who touched him? His di&s;ciples, as they were not appri&s;ed of the tran&s;action, wondered at their Ma&s;ter's que&s;tion. <HI>Thou &s;ee&s;t,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>the multitude thronging and pre&s;&s;ing thee, and &s;aye&s;t thou, who touched me?</HI> JESUS, however, per&s;i&s;ted in the inquiry, and the woman, perceiving &s;he could not be concealed, came to him trembling, and told him what &s;he had done. She approached him with hi&s;itation and diffidence, fearing he would be offended at the liberty &s;he had taken; but the divine Phy&s;ician received her with conde&s;cending goodne&s;s, &s;pake to her in the kinde&s;t manner, and commended her faith; <HI>Daughter,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole.</HI></P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of the &s;urpri&s;e occa&s;ioned by this miracle, a me&s;&s;enger approached from Jarius's hou&s;e, and informed him that his daughter was dead, &s;o that he need not give our Lord the trouble to come any further; for they &s;uppo&s;ed it far beyond the power of this extraordinary per&s;on to overcome the mighty conqueror Death, or recall the fleeting &s;pirit from the eternal world. This me&s;&s;age was received by the affectionate parent with the &s;tronge&s;t emotions of &s;orrow, and bittere&s;t agonies of di&s;tre&s;s. Our Lord took compa&s;&s;ion on him, and de&s;ired him to be comforted with hopes, that his daughter &s;hould be re&s;tored.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="029927_0066_0FE3362EF3DA8558">WHEN our great Redeemer came to the ruler's hou&s;e, he found it full of mourners, who made great lamentation, and were preparing for the funeral. Our Lord com|manded them to cea&s;e their preparations; <HI>for,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>the maid is not dead, but &s;leepeth: and they laughed him to &s;corn.</HI> The&s;e words of CHRIST were u&s;ed with peculiar propriety, to denote that it was determined the virgin &s;hould not continue in the cold embraces of death, but &s;hould in&s;tantly be re&s;tored to her friends as one awakened out of &s;leep; and having thus &s;poken, our Lord approached the apartment of the dead, taking with him none but Peter, James, and John, except the father and mother of the maiden: then laying hold of the cold hand of the dead virgin, he &s;aid with a gentle voice, <HI>Maid, ari&s;e!</HI> The heavenly voice was immediately obeyed, and the dam&s;el aro&s;e, fre&s;h as from a &s;ound &s;leep, all healthful and vigorous; and JESUS commanded to give her &s;omething to eat.</P>
<P>THUS the great Son of God gave a full and clear manife&s;tation of his heavenly power: and not only proved that he was the true Me&s;&s;iah, but gave a clear demon&s;tration of the po&s;&s;ibility of the re&s;urrection of the dead: and tho&s;e who have imbibed the ab&s;urd opinion of the &s;oul's &s;leeping with the body till the re&s;urrection, would do well to con&s;ider the expre&s;&s;ion of the evangeli&s;t, <HI>Her &s;pirit came again,</HI> Luke viii.55: by which it appears that the &s;oul exi&s;ts in a &s;tate of &s;eparation, when the body lies all cold and breathle&s;s in the dark chambers of the grave.</P>
<P>HAVING performed this great and benevolent miracle, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour left the ruler's hou&s;e; and going through the &s;treets of the city, he was followed by two blind men; they had, doubtle&s;s, heard of the great miracle which he had ju&s;t performed, and &s;upplicated his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their pre&s;ent deplorable circum&s;tances, well knowing that he was able to re&s;tore them to &s;ight. The benevolent Saviour of &s;inners conde&s;cended to favour their reque&s;t; and having entered an hou&s;e to e&s;cape the crowding of the multitude, he touched their eyes, and &s;aid, <HI>According to your faith be it unto you;</HI> when immediately the great and de&s;irable ble&s;&s;ing of &s;ight was re&s;tored unto them; the &s;acred beams of all-chearing day revi&s;ited their eyes, and filled their hearts with gladne&s;s&punc; and their tongues with prai&s;e; and &s;uch a flood of gratitude and joy overflowed their hearts, that they could not conceal their miraculous re&s;toration to &s;ight, though our Lord required them to keep &s;ilence, but publi&s;hed our Redeemer's fame and their own happy condition, through every part of the country.</P>
<P>THE men who had thus miraculou&s;ly received their &s;ight being departed, the multitude brought to the benevolent Saviour of Sinners a dumb man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a devil. So affecting a ca&s;e attracted the compa&s;&s;ionate regard of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> immediately ca&s;t out the foul &s;pirit. The dumb man in&s;tantly recovered the u&s;e of &s;peech, and &s;pake in &s;o &s;en&s;ible and &s;atisfactory a manner, that the whole multitude were amazed, and, declared that &s;uch wonderous works were never wrought by the greate&s;t and mo&s;t eminent of the ancient prophets, <HI>It was,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>never &s;o &s;een in I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>THE Phari&s;ees who&s;e hearts were full of infernal rancour, and who&s;e pride and preju|dice prevented their receiving in&s;truction from the di&s;cour&s;es, or conviction from the miracles of our great Redeemer, beheld the miracle now performed with a &s;cornful &s;neer, and put the mo&s;t invidious con&s;truction upon it, that could po&s;&s;ibly enter into the heart of man: <HI>He ca&s;teth out Devils,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>through the prince of the Devils.</HI> The ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, &s;eems, at this time, to have taken no notice of this calumny: but leaving the haughty, &s;elf-conceited doctors, under the dominion of their blindne&s;s, and prejudice, he proceeded in the pro&s;ecution of the duties of his mi&s;&s;ion, and exerted him&s;elf more and more in the great work of promoting the cau&s;e of truth, and enlightening and in|&s;tructing mankind. Accordingly leaving Capernaum, he took a tour through the ad|jacent
<PB N="64" REF="029927_0067_0FE336307B1BFD10">
country, bringing happine&s;s and peace to the &s;ons of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>vi&s;iting all the cities and villages, teaching in their &s;ynagogues, and preaching the go&s;pel of the kingdom, and healing every &s;ickne&s;s, and every di&s;ea&s;e amongst the people.</HI></P>
<P>AT his return to Galilee, he was &s;urrounded by va&s;t multitudes of people, who ex|pre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire to hear his in&s;tructions, and learn the way of truth and happi|ne&s;s from his lips. This tractable di&s;po&s;ition of mind engaged the attention of the great Redeemer of &s;inners, and filled his heart with compa&s;&s;ion for them, in their pre&s;ent deplorable &s;tate of blindne&s;s and ignorance, and excited him to exert his divine power for their relief. Indeed the &s;tate of the Jewi&s;h nation at this time was worthy of com|pa&s;&s;ion; for, with re&s;pect to &s;piritual things, the common people might ju&s;tly be com|pared to &s;heep without a &s;hepherd. The Scribes, Phari&s;ees, and lawyers, who ought to have in&s;tructed them, were blind, lazy guides, and their teaching tended rather to lead them a&s;ide from the paths of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, than to afford them any real advantage: their teaching tended rather to magnify and exalt them&s;elves than pro|mote the knowledge or wor&s;hip of their maker; and to encourage a &s;crupulous exact|ne&s;s in external ceremonial performances, rather than promote the cau&s;e of truth, purity, and virtue. In this dark and forlorn condition, our Lord had compa&s;&s;ion on the multi|tude, and, in his divine wi&s;dom and benevolence, proceeded to take proper mea&s;ures for their relief. He always regarded the &s;eed of I&s;rael with peculiar affection; and as they were wandering on the dark mountains of error and &s;uper&s;tition, without any to re&s;|train their wanderings, or teach their &s;teps to find the way of peace, he recommended their ca&s;e to his di&s;ciples, and commanded them to approach the throne of God, with earne&s;t prayers in their behalf: <HI>The harve&s;t,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harve&s;t, that he will &s;end forth labourers into his harve&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>NOR did our great Redeemer recommend this affecting ca&s;e to his di&s;ciples, without employing his own mo&s;t powerful interce&s;&s;ion with his heavenly Father: for he a&s;cended a mountain, and continued all night in prayer to God. Having &s;pent the night in earne&s;t &s;upplication, the morning no &s;ooner returned, than he &s;et about the important ta&s;k of divine in&s;truction. To this end, he cho&s;e twelve out of the number of his di&s;ciples, and named them apo&s;tles, <HI>to be always with him, and that he might &s;end them forth to preach.</HI> The&s;e were Simon Peter, and Andrew, his brother; James the &s;on of Zebedee, and John his brother, Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew; James the &s;on of Alpheus, and Lebbus, who&s;e &s;urname was Thaddeus Simon the Canaanite, and Judas I&s;cariot. The&s;e twelve having been con&s;tant attendants on our Lord, having learnt his heavenly doctrine, and &s;een his wonderous works, and being fully qualified to preach to the world, tho&s;e divine truths, which them&s;elves had received, were &s;ent out to preach the go&s;pel of the kingdom; but commanded not to enter into any city of the Samaritans, or of the Gentiles, but confine them&s;elves to the land of I&s;rael, and to proclaim through the nation, that <HI>the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</HI> They were al&s;o provided with miraculous power to prove the truth of their doctrine, and manife&s;t to the world, that they came from God, and were commanded to exert tho&s;e divine powers with unremitting ardour, for the ad|vantage of mankind. The command of their divine Ma&s;ter, was to <HI>heal the &s;ick; clean&s;e the lepers; rai&s;e the dead; ca&s;t out devils; freely,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>ye have received, freely give.</HI> And that they might be &s;en&s;ible of the care of their heavenly Father, over the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tances which concerned them, they were enjoined to make no provi&s;ion for their journey, nor take any care about temporal things: <HI>Provide,</HI> &s;aid their divine Ma&s;ter, <HI>neither gold nor bra&s;s in your pur&s;es, nor &s;crip for your journey, neither two coats, nor &s;hoes, neither yet &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aves; for the workman is worthy of his meat.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="029927_0068_0FE336320460F8C0">PROBABLY the apo&s;tles, knowing that the whole Jewi&s;h nation was elated with the apprehen&s;ion of the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah, and the high expectations they had formed of his &s;itting up a temporal kingdom, might expect to be received with honour and e&s;teem by their countrymen, as they were going to publi&s;h the &s;peedy approach of that kingdom which they &s;o ardently de&s;ired, and to work &s;uch miracles, as might convince them that their declaration was true: but their Ma&s;ter informed them, that the event, in this ca&s;e, would not be an&s;werable to their expectation; for, in&s;tead of being care&s;&s;ed and honoured by their countrymen, he a&s;&s;ured them, they &s;hould meet with deri&s;ion and con|tempt: he informed them that they &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed and per&s;ecuted, delivered to the rulers, and puni&s;hed as wicked man. But, at the &s;ame time, he promi&s;ed them the con|&s;tant protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his heavenly Father, and gave them minute and parti|cular in&s;tructions for their behaviour on every occa&s;ion; and let them know, that whoever rejected them and their me&s;&s;age, &s;hould be rejected and treated with indignation and &s;corn, by the great Judge of the world: but tho&s;e who received them with kindne&s;s, attended to their preaching and received it with hone&s;ty and openne&s;s of mind, kindly contributing to their &s;upport, though they gave but a cup of cold water to the lea&s;t of his di&s;ciples, &s;hould not fail of receiving a large reward.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tles having received this commi&s;&s;ion, vi&s;ited all parts of the country, preaching the doctrine of repentence and proclaiming the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah at hand. They confirmed the truth of their declarations, by working of miracles, healing the &s;ick, and performing every great work which was worthy their ma&s;ter's cau&s;e, and nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the minds of mankind to receive him; while our great Redeemer continued the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try in Galilee, and by the divine eloquence of his preaching, and the wonders he wrought proved him&s;elf to be the Son of God.</P>
<P>IN the eye of worldly wi&s;dom, it mu&s;t &s;eem a very fooli&s;h and unpopular attempt to &s;end a parcel of illiterate, de&s;pi&s;ed Galileans to reform the world: how was it po&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch per&s;ons as the&s;e, &s;hould confound the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e, and bafflle the power of the mighty? How was it po&s;&s;ible, that they &s;hould overturn the many fal&s;e religions which then flouri&s;hed in the world, which were &s;upported by civil government, and had e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves by long continuance, were deep-rooted in the human heart, and maintained by the pa&s;&s;ions, prejudices, and intere&s;t of mankind. Had human prudence directed to the choice of per&s;ons to be employed on this great occa&s;ion, they doubtle&s;s would have been men of great learning, &s;uperior eloquence, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every art of per&s;ua&s;ion and addre&s;s. But the wi&s;dom of God &s;toops not to be directed by the wi&s;dom of man; his ways are not as our ways, nor his thoughts as our thoughts. When his glorious go&s;pel was &s;ent to enlighten and enrich the world, this divine trea&s;ure was com|mitted to earthen ve&s;&s;els, that the excellency of the power might appear to be of God: accordingly, it appeared that the religion which the&s;e illiterate fi&s;hermen, the&s;e de&s;pi&s;ed Galieans publi&s;hed through the world, was far &s;uperior, was more worthy of God, and beneficial to man, than the acute&s;t rea&s;onings, or the &s;ublime&s;t &s;trains of the Greek and Roman philo&s;opers and poets, though they were furni&s;hed with all the &s;tores of human literature, and &s;pent their whole time in &s;tudy and contemplation. Hence, it is manife&s;t, that the glorious go&s;pel of God, by its noble &s;implicity, by its own intrin&s;ic dignity and worth, as well as by the miraculous power which attended it, and the heavenly glory which &s;hone around it, proved it&s;elf to be wholly original and divine.</P>
<P>NOR was the &s;ucce&s;s which attended the attempts of the&s;e weak and de&s;pi&s;ed in&s;tru|ments, wanting to prove the divine original of the doctrine they taught; while the tenets
<PB N="66" REF="029927_0069_0FE3363AA86270A0">
of the philo&s;ophers were confined to their re&s;pective &s;chools, the glorious go&s;pel &s;preads over the world, and was received in every country, and by men of every &s;tation; it was received by the bulk of mankind, with the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, and the &s;ublime&s;t joy; as &s;omething nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;upreme good, which hitherto they had been &s;eeking in vain. It was, therefore, the highe&s;t wi&s;dom which conducted the propagation of the go&s;pel, and made u&s;e of &s;uch low and contemptible per&s;ons; for hence, it plainly ap|peared, that the&s;e noble truths were not of human invention, but were the production of Infinite Wi&s;dom, and were fir&s;t advanced, and are &s;till &s;upported, by the mighty power of God.</P>
<P>AFTER our great Redeemer had appointed his twelve apo&s;tles, he came down from the mountain, and was joyfully received by multitudes of people, who were waiting for him in the plain: and &s;uch was the heavenly virtue which attended and &s;urrounded him, that whoever touched the border of his garment, was healed of his di&s;ea&s;e. This is &s;ufficient to account for the great numbers of people which daily followed this illu&s;trious per&s;on, who crowded around him, wherever he went, and accompanied him to the remote&s;t part of the wilderne&s;s of Judea; nor was it only the vulgar and nece&s;&s;itous that pur&s;ued our Redeemer's &s;teps where&s;oever he went, but per&s;ons of high rank and character, came from the remote&s;t parts to conver&s;e with him, hear his divine doctrine, and be &s;pectators of his wondrous works, and partakers of the benefits re&s;ulting from them.</P>
<P>AFTER healing the &s;ick among&s;t the multitude, he proceeded to in&s;truct them, and delivered a divine di&s;cour&s;e, in &s;ub&s;tance nearly the &s;ame as that which he before preached from the mountain: the chief difference in the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, is the threatenings which are here denounced again&s;t particular &s;inners, whereas the di&s;cour&s;e recorded by St. Matthew, contains only ble&s;&s;ings. It may not be ami&s;s, briefly to con&s;ider the&s;e male|dictions, as a large paraphra&s;e hath been given on the former &s;ermon.</P>
<P><HI>WOE unto you that are rich,</HI> &s;aid our exalted Saviour, <HI>for you have received your con&s;olation.</HI> Riches in this world are no evidence of the love of God, but are frequently be&s;towed on the wor&s;t of men; they are not be&s;towed upon any as a reward for &s;uperior degrees of moral goodne&s;s, but are di&s;tributed by the great governor of the univer&s;e, &s;o as to an&s;wer the wi&s;e ends of his own government, and bring about his great de&s;igns: they have no tendency to promote the be&s;t intere&s;t of man, but are frequently made u&s;e of by the wor&s;t of men, to the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es, and enable them to be more exten&s;ively and de&s;perately wicked: they are frequently a &s;nare to the truly religious, and have a natural tendency to pervert the affections, and corrupt the heart. It requires great grace to keep them from degrading the &s;oul, and generating a low, mean, worldly &s;pirit; for, wherever the natural cour&s;e and tendency of riches prevail, it will always remain an eternal truth, that <HI>it is ea&s;ier for a camel to pa&s;s through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WOE unto you that laugh, for ye &s;hall mourn and weep.</HI> It is not a joyful, cheerful, thankful frame of &s;pirit, which our Lord here exclaims again&s;t, but a fooli&s;h, trifling, levity of mind. The go&s;pel of CHRIST, is particularly calculated to in&s;pire a con&s;tant cheerfulne&s;s of temper, and Chri&s;tians are commanded always to rejoice; the a&s;&s;urance they have of reconciliation with God, the lively hope of everla&s;ting life, the con&s;tant plea&s;ure which they find in communion with God, and the contemplation on heavenly things, tend to fill the mind with &s;olid &s;atisfaction and &s;ub&s;tantial joy. This joy will be con&s;tantly in|crea&s;ing, as Chri&s;tians advance in the divine life, and will be fully completed in the eternal world: but tho&s;e giddy, gay &s;allies of mirth, and the thoughtle&s;s di&s;&s;ipation of
<PB N="67" REF="029927_0070_0FE3363C77C38728">
mind which ari&s;es from an immoderate love of vain amu&s;ement and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, that gives no time for con&s;ideration, but &s;catters &s;erious thoughts, and creates an utter aver&s;ion to &s;ober reflection, will &s;oon lead the &s;oul into &s;uch a labyrinth of wretchedne&s;s and woe, that they &s;hall then mourn and weep. This will certainly be their lot in this world, when their vain delu&s;ive gratifications can plea&s;e no more; and it will eternally be their lot, when they will be deprived of every gleam of hope and comfort, and con|&s;igned to the dark regions of &s;orrow and de&s;pair, <HI>where will be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth.</HI></P>
<P>BUT our great Redeemer added, <HI>Woe unto you when all men &s;peak well of you, for &s;o did their fathers of the fal&s;e prophets.</HI> This malediction of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, is denounced again&s;t tho&s;e teachers who, for fear of offending men, &s;hall keep back the truth of God, and fear to proclaim the unpopular and humbling truths of the go&s;pel, which are &s;o mor|tifying to human pride, and by flattering the vices, and humouring the pride and pa&s;&s;ions of men, &s;hall gain their commendation and applau&s;e. Such teachers as the&s;e, are compared to the fal&s;e prophets of old, who, by humouring the vanity and flattering the pride of princes and great men, were more care&s;&s;ed and attended to than the true prophets of God.</P>
<P>WHEN our great Redeemer had fini&s;hed his di&s;cour&s;e, he departed to Capernaum, and was met by &s;ome me&s;&s;engers from a Centurion, who de&s;ired him to come and heal a &s;er|vant whom he highly e&s;teemed, that was &s;ick, and in danger of death. This Centurion, from the character given him by the evangeli&s;t, &s;eems to have been a pro&s;elyte to the Jewi&s;h religion. The inhabitants of Capernaum &s;pake much in his favour, and &s;trongly recommended his ca&s;e; for they &s;aid, that <HI>he was a lover of their religion, and had built them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ynagogue.</HI> The great Saviour of mankind, who went about doing good, graciou&s;ly attended to the petition, and readily accompanied the me&s;&s;engers; but before he arrived at the hou&s;e, he was met by a party of the centurion's friends, who expre&s;&s;ed the high conception which that officer had of the divine power of our Redeemer, and de&s;ired he would not give him&s;elf the trouble of a per&s;onal attendance, as his word would be abun|dantly &s;ufficient to accompli&s;h the cure. Our Lord was plea&s;ed with the me&s;&s;age, and turning to the &s;pectators, &s;aid, <HI>I have not found &s;o great faith, no, not in I&s;rael,</HI> Luke vii.9. The per&s;ons having delivered their me&s;&s;age, returned to the Centurion's hou&s;e, and found the &s;ick per&s;on perfectly recovered.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal circum&s;tances attending this miracle, and that related by St. Mat|thew, proves that this Centurion was not the &s;ame per&s;on. The Centurion mentioned by St. Matthew, attended on CHRIST in per&s;on; him who&s;e ca&s;e is la&s;t related, pre&s;ented his petition by the elders of Capernaum. It does not appear that the former Centurion was a pro&s;elyte to the Jewi&s;h religion; but we find a very high character given of the latter: the&s;e, and &s;everal other particulars which might have been mentioned, to prove that this miracle ought to be con&s;idered &s;eparate from the former.</P>
<P>THIS miracle being performed, our Lord repaired to the hou&s;e of Peter, to eat bread; the place of his re&s;idence could not be concealed; great multitudes of people &s;urrounded the hou&s;e; &s;ome, no doubt, de&s;iring to behold the wonders which he wrought, and others, to be partakers of the benefit re&s;ulting from them; they continued there &s;ome time, advancing their re&s;pective claims, in a tumultuous manner, and it was with diffi|culty they were per&s;uaded to di&s;per&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CHRIST</HI> retires to Nain, a City of Galilee, where he rai&s;es a Widow's only Son from the Dead: He receives Me&s;&s;engers from John the Bapti&s;t, and gives his Te&s;timony concerning him: After which he dines with Simon the Leper, where he is anointed by Mary, who&s;e affection he acknowledges and rewards.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE the apo&s;tles were proceeding through the &s;everal cities of Judea, executing the commi&s;&s;ion of their Divine Ma&s;ter, our great Redeemer was carrying on the work of his mi&s;&s;ion in Galilee; and when they had returned to our Lord, they accom|panied him and his di&s;ciples to Nain, a city near mount Tabor, where he was followed by a great multitude of people. On their approaching the gate of the city, a &s;cene of the mo&s;t affecting affliction and di&s;tre&s;s pre&s;ented it&s;elf to their view; <HI>Behold there was a dead man carried out, the only &s;on of his mother, and &s;he was a widow.</HI> What an affecting &s;cene was this, and how was the affliction and di&s;tre&s;s of the mournful parent heightened by every circum&s;tance which could make it the more bitter? A young man cut down, probably in his prime, and followed to the grave by his weeping parent. With &s;low and &s;olemn &s;teps, &s;carce able to bear up under the load of her woes, the mourning matron follows the dead to interment, attended by her affected friends and neighbours, who had &s;trove in vain to comfort her for the lo&s;s of her only &s;on; for the young man was <HI>the only &s;on of his mother,</HI> on whom perhaps, &s;he depended for &s;upport; and to render her afflic|tion to the la&s;t degree heavy and in&s;upportable, <HI>&s;he was a widow.</HI> With tender pity our great Redeemer beheld this daughter of affliction, and immediately exerted his divine power for relief. There was no need of any interce&s;&s;or to prevail with the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS to attend to &s;uch a ca&s;e as this; his own compa&s;&s;ion was &s;ufficient to excite him to relieve her. The evangeli&s;t informs us, that <HI>when the Lord &s;aw her, he had compa&s;&s;ion on her,</HI> and gently approaching, he bid her forbear to weep. But &s;o great was her lo&s;s, that it had opened all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">luices of &s;orrow, and it was in vain to bid her refrain from tears. Her hu&s;band was no more, and now &s;he had lo&s;t her only &s;on, the &s;urviving image of his departed father, and the la&s;t hope of her afflicted &s;oul. What comfort in the ordinary cour&s;e of nature could be admini&s;tered to this mournful widow? She had lo&s;t her hu&s;|band; &s;he had lo&s;t her &s;on. What di&s;tre&s;s could be more overwhelming? What ca&s;e could be more deplorable? And how natural is it to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he &s;hould <HI>refu&s;e to be comforted;</HI> and to determine to <HI>go down to the grave with mourning.</HI> Our Lord well knew the weight of her affliction and the heavy pre&s;&s;ure of her pre&s;ent grief, and therefore u&s;ed no arguments to comfort her; but approaching the corp&s;e, he <HI>touched the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r.</HI> The funeral proce&s;&s;ion immediately &s;tood &s;till, and the whole train in &s;ilent expectation awaited the event: when that powerful voice, which one day the dead &s;hall hear, and they that hear &s;hall live, &s;oon uttered the&s;e remarkable words <HI>young man, I &s;ay to thee ari&s;e:</HI> no &s;ooner had our great Redeemer &s;poke, but the joyful event followed: <HI>he that was dead &s;at up, and began to &s;peak, and he re&s;tored him to his mother.</HI> With what emotions of joy mu&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e this mournful mother would receive her only &s;on thus unexpectedly re&s;cued from the cold arms of death! What a flood of tenderne&s;s would bur&s;t upon the &s;oul, and with what gratitude and joy would &s;he behold his great deliverer, who did not make any &s;hew of this &s;tupenduous miracle among&s;t the multitude of his followers, and the attendants on the funeral, but immediately delivered the revived young man to his late afflicted, but now wondering and rejoicing mother, as a te&s;timony that this great work was wrought in compa&s;&s;ion to her di&s;tre&s;s. The &s;urrounding multitudes beheld this wonderful event with a mixture of a&s;toni&s;hment, plea&s;ure, holy awe, and fear; <HI>and they glorified God, &s;aying, that great prophet is ari&s;en amongst us, and that God hath vi&s;ited his people.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="029927_0072_0FE336404C2010A0">IF we take a review of this miracle, we may ob&s;erve that it is liable to no objection, and abundantly proves the exertion of divine power. It is to be ob&s;erved that it was wrought in the open field among&s;t a va&s;t number of &s;pectators. A great number of the inhabitants of the city attended the funeral; they all bewailed the di&s;con&s;olate &s;tate of the afflicted widow, and had the opportunity of being &s;atisfied that the youth was really dead. The powerful word which called the dead man to life was delivered in an audible voice before all the company; and this was done at the gate of the city, a place of general re&s;ort; every one had the opportunity of &s;atisfying them&s;elves that the young man was really re&s;tored to life. There was no po&s;&s;ibility of deception, nor room for objections of any kind; and this miracle, joined with the re&s;t wrought by the &s;ame divine per&s;on, abundantly proves that he was the Son of God, and the Saviour of &s;inners.</P>
<P>THE fame of the wonderful works which JESUS con&s;tantly performed, was rapidly pro|claimed through the various cities of Judea, and by the di&s;ciples of John the Bapti&s;t carried to their ma&s;ter. This prophet, as we before related, was ca&s;t into pri&s;on by Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee. The cau&s;e of his impri&s;onment was the offence which that prince had taken at his boldly and freely blaming his conduct re&s;pecting his ince&s;tuous connection with the prince&s;s Herodias. John had now been confined above a year in pri&s;on, and as he was fully convinced that CHRIST was really the Me&s;&s;iah, and no doubt having imbibed the national expectation of the Jews, that the Me&s;&s;iah would &s;et up a temporal kingdom, he perceived that things did not an&s;wer his expectation: for, doubtle&s;s, he apprehended, that before this time CHRIST would have manife&s;ted him&s;elf, and made &s;ome advances towards his taking the reins of government. He therefore &s;ent two of his di&s;ciples to our great Redeemer, with this que&s;tion, <HI>Art thou he that &s;hould come, or look we for another?</HI> We are not to &s;uppo&s;e by this inquiry, that John entertained any he&s;itation or doubt, whether CHRIST was the true Me&s;&s;iah, or not; for it is to be ob&s;erved, that throughout the whole cour&s;e of his mini&s;try, he had borne a regular and ample te&s;timony to the truth of his divine mi&s;&s;ion: he had been convinced by a particular revelation from heaven, and by the de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t, in a vi&s;ible form at CHRIST's bapti&s;m, that he was that divine per&s;on who was to come to be the Saviour of I&s;rael; and accordingly he made it his con&s;tant care to di&s;po&s;e the Jews in general, and his own di&s;ciples in particular, to receive and reverence him as the Me&s;&s;iah, bearing witne&s;s concerning him that he was &s;uperior to him&s;elf, and holding him up to view as <HI>the Lamb of God who taketh away the &s;in of the world.</HI> It cannot therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed as before ob&s;erved, that the Bapti&s;t entertained any &s;cruples in his mind concerning our Lord's divinity; but his de&s;ign &s;eems to be to lead his di&s;ciples into an acquaintance with our great Redeemer, that by beholding his miracles, and hearing his divine conver|&s;ation, their minds might be prepared to receive him; for it is not improbable to &s;up|po&s;e, that the prophet John might have &s;ome expectations of his own approaching death.</P>
<P>NOR was the conviction of his di&s;ciples, perhaps, the only view which the prophet had in &s;ending this me&s;&s;age to our great Redeemer; it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that, like the re&s;t of his countrymen, he expected the Me&s;&s;iah to &s;et up a temporal kingdom. Nor is this &s;uppo&s;ition derogatory to the dignity of a great prophet, &s;ince we are informed, that though John was <HI>a prophet and more than a prophet, the lea&s;t in the kingdom of Heaven is greater than he;</HI> the meane&s;t preacher of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel is greater than the Bapti&s;t, becau&s;e he had the opportunity of being informed of the &s;piritual nature of CHRIST's kingdom. As then, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that great forerunner of our Redeemer ardently de&s;ired, and impatiently expected the appearance of his kingdom; and as the ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="70" REF="029927_0073_0FE336491A427150">
JESUS had a&s;&s;umed no earthly honour or dignity, but every thing in the Jewi&s;h church and &s;tate continued the &s;ame; the Bapti&s;t might &s;end this me&s;&s;age gently to remind him of what was expected from him as the Redeemer of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples of John brought this me&s;&s;age from their ma&s;ter to the exalted Saviour of the world, while he was attending to the various di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the multitude which &s;ur|rounded him, curing many of their infermities, plagues, and evil &s;pirits, and re&s;toring &s;ight to the blind. The&s;e miracles the di&s;ciples of John beheld, and having delivered their me&s;&s;age, our Lord did not think proper to return them a direct an&s;wer, but referred them to the wonderful works they had now been ob&s;erving, and ordered them to carry an account of the&s;e things to their ma&s;ter, as an an&s;wer to his inquiry: <HI>go your way,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and tell John what things you have heard and &s;een, how that the blind &s;ee, the lame walk, the lepers are clean&s;ed, the deaf hear, the dead are rai&s;ed, and the poor have the go&s;pel preached unto them.</HI></P>
<P>BUT that the multitude, from the propo&s;al of this que&s;tion, might not form an unfa|vourable opinion of John the Bapti&s;t, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour at this time thought proper to place his character in the mo&s;t favourable point of light. He commended him as a per&s;on of the mo&s;t invincible courage, re&s;olution, and fortitude, who &s;tood firm in the mid&s;t of trouble and affliction, and was not like <HI>a read &s;haken with the wind</HI>; and prai&s;ed him for his au&s;tere and mortified cour&s;e of life, not <HI>wearing &s;oft raiment, like tho&s;e in king's palaces,</HI> but maintained a manly hardine&s;s, and abhorred all luxury, effeminacy, and di&s;&s;ipation. Our great Redeemer then gave a full and clear te&s;timony to the prophetic office of the Bapti&s;t, and declared that he was the per&s;on referred to by the prophet I&s;aiah, in tho&s;e remarkable words, <HI>Behold, I &s;end my me&s;&s;enger before thy face, which &s;hall prepare thy way before thee:</HI> and added, that this extraordinary per&s;on was that <HI>Elias which,</HI> the ancient prophets declared, <HI>was to come.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord having done ju&s;tice to the character of his great forerunner, he took occa&s;ion from thence to blame and rebuke the ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s of the great men and high pretenders to religion among&s;t the Jews, who had rejected both his own and the Bapti&s;t's te&s;timony. It &s;eem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, by the nature of CHRIST's rebuke, that the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, who pretend to great fa&s;ting and mortification, thought them&s;elves eclip&s;ed, and with envious vexation beheld them&s;elves outdone by the real au&s;terity of the Bapti&s;t. His living in the de&s;ert, and &s;hunning the company of men and the conveniences of life, the coar&s;ene&s;s of his cloathing, the ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s and plainne&s;s of his diet, and the real &s;everities he practi&s;ed, they beheld with growing rancour, and not only repre&s;ented them as imprudent and unnece&s;&s;ary but proceeded &s;o far as to declare him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an apo&s;tate &s;pirit: <HI>For John came neither eating nor drinking; and ye &s;ay, He hath a devil.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though the&s;e bold pretenders to &s;uperior &s;anctity and mortification, could exclaim again&s;t the Bapti&s;t on account of the au&s;terity of his life, it was manife&s;t that it was envy and not rea&s;on which promoted their unbelief: for when CHRIST, on the contrary, dwelt in cities, and conver&s;ed with mankind, enjoining no au&s;terities nor mortification, they could make u&s;e of this conduct as a ground of reproach. <HI>The &s;on of man came eating and drinking:</HI> though he could not by his mo&s;t inveterate enemies be charged with any in|temperance, or with encouraging it in others; yet the&s;e determined oppo&s;ers of heavenly truth could &s;ay, <HI>Behold a man, gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, and a friend of publicans and &s;inners! But,</HI> &s;aid our great Redeemer, <HI>wi&s;dom is ju&s;tified of her children.</HI></P>
<P>HE then proceeded to upbraid the &s;everal cities where his mo&s;t wonderful works had been performed; they had enjoyed the opportunity of attending his heavenly di&s;cour&s;es,
<PB N="71" REF="029927_0074_0FE3364AA1370D40">
and had been witne&s;s to his wonderful works; frequently had they &s;een him perform miracles which could not be di&s;puted, but fully manife&s;ted the mighty power of God; they had often &s;een him perform wonders &s;ufficient to have convinced the mo&s;t ignorant and idolatrous nations, who were immer&s;ed in the depth of &s;en&s;uality, and had imbibed the &s;tronge&s;t prejudices again&s;t the truth: yet, &s;o great was their ob&s;tinacy, they per|&s;i&s;ted in their unbelief, they per&s;i&s;ted in their wickedne&s;s notwith&s;tanding all he had done to convince and reform them. <HI>Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Beth&s;aida!</HI> &s;aid our great Redeemer, <HI>for if the mighty works which have been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes. But I &s;ay unto you it &s;hall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you. And thou Capernaum, that art exalted unto heaven, &s;halt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works that have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained unto this day. But I &s;ay unto you, that it &s;hall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.</HI> Matt. xi.21, &amp;c.</P>
<P>AFTER having, in the mo&s;t awful, affecting and awakening manner, pronounced &s;uch woes on the&s;e unbelieving and profligate cities, our great Redeemer concluded his di&s;|cour&s;e with the&s;e gracious and reviving words, <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t.</HI> It is the Son of the eternal God, the Heir of all things, the almighty Judge of heaven and earth, who kindly conde&s;cends to addre&s;s poor, lo&s;t, undone &s;inners in this affecting language; having pronounced heavy woes on the rebel|lious race, who&s;e haughty &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, inveterate prejudice, pride and ob&s;tinacy, pre|vented their receiving the truth, the kind and conde&s;cending Saviour of &s;inners gives the mo&s;t tender, heart-affecting invitation to the humble and penitent. Tho&s;e who <HI>labour and are heavy laden;</HI> tho&s;e who are con&s;cious of their vilene&s;s and &s;infulne&s;s, who are pre&s;&s;ed with the weight of their iniquities; who&s;e guilt lies upon them like an heavy burden, from the weight of which they ardently de&s;ire to be delivered, are here called upon and earne&s;tly invited to come to the only per&s;on who is able to relieve them. It is not the great and noble; it is not the powerful, pro&s;perous, and happy; it is not the exulting &s;ons of joy, but the poor, needy, and afflicted, who are labouring under a &s;en&s;e of &s;in, and burdened with the weight of their iniquities, who are thus invited to come to our great Redeemer. The great Maker of all things, the all-wi&s;e and all-powerful Pre&s;erver, the &s;upreme Governor and Judge of the univer&s;e, graciou&s;ly conde&s;cends to call unto, and with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s to invite poor, heavy-laden, burdened &s;inners to come; he does not call upon them to come with a de&s;ign to puni&s;h their offences; he does not &s;ummon them to appear before his awful &s;eat of judgment; he does not call them with a de&s;ign to deride or expo&s;e their mi&s;eries; he does not call them with an intent to puni&s;h their offences, but with a de&s;ign to relea&s;e them from their afflctions, to relea&s;e them from their burdens, to give them re&s;t and peace, and make them eternally happy. <HI>Come unto me,</HI> &s;ays our great Redeemer, <HI>all ye that labour and are heavy laden;</HI> all you who are humbled under a &s;en&s;e of your iniquities; who &s;ee the dreadful condition to which you are reduced by your &s;ins; who have been long groaning under the into|lerable weight of your guilt, and panting for deliverance; but throughout the limits of the wide creation can find no refuge; no help, no deliverer. <HI>Come unto me, look unto me and be &s;aved;</HI> tru&s;t in me as <HI>mighty to &s;ave</HI>; venture your all in my hands; &s;eek no other refuge, no other help, no other deliverer; but <HI>come unto me and I will give you re&s;t.</HI> It is not my de&s;ign to upbraid you with the vilene&s;s and folly of your conduct; it is not my de&s;ign to enter into judgment with you and puni&s;h you for your iniquities, but to lead you into the paths of peace, truth and happine&s;s: be not afraid to li&s;ten to my words and follow my directions, but with a full reliance on my power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s, <HI>take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye &s;hall find re&s;t to
<PB N="72" REF="029927_0075_0FE3364C26E71B40">
your &s;ouls: for my yoke is ea&s;y, and my burden is light.</HI> Can there be a greater evidence of the corruption and depravity of the human heart than the coldne&s;s with which the dege|nerate &s;ons of Adam, receive &s;o tender, &s;o affecting, and &s;o important an invitation. The great Creator hath formed them with &s;trong de&s;ires of happine&s;s, and they toil out a weary life, in the eager pur&s;uit of every appearance of good. They are lo&s;t in the pur|&s;uit, and in&s;tead of happine&s;s, find them&s;elves plunged in trouble, vexation and woe; they find them&s;elves burdened with many griefs, but will not come to him who only is able to relieve them. What blindne&s;s, &s;tupidity, and abominable pride po&s;&s;e&s;s the human heart, and excite it to reject the gracious calls and invitations of the only Saviour of &s;inners!</P>
<P>AFTER our great Redeemer had fini&s;hed his di&s;cour&s;e, he was invited by one Simon a leper, to go to his hou&s;e, and take &s;ome refre&s;hment. The invitation he accepted, and accompanied him to his apartment, where, as he &s;at at meat, a woman who&s;e cour&s;e of life was known to have been loo&s;e and profligate, &s;at at his feet beholding him with the tendere&s;t affection, and &s;hed &s;uch floods of tears that they trickled down his feet, which according to the cu&s;tom of the country were bare. She &s;eeing that her tears had wet the feet, of her beloved Lord, wiped them with her hair, frequently ki&s;&s;ing them with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s and affection, and anointed them with precious ointment. It was doubtle&s;s the &s;en&s;e of her former cour&s;e of life, and a deep conviction of her crimes, which cau&s;ed this woman to &s;hed &s;uch a profu&s;ion of tears; and her love to the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS aro&s;e from the benefit &s;he had received from his heavenly di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>THE cu&s;tom, which then prevailed in the Ea&s;tern countries, of pouring fragrant oil on the heads of tho&s;e gue&s;ts on whom they de&s;igned to be&s;tow peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of honour, &s;eems to have brought this woman to our Redeemer at this time; and it appears to have been her original intention to have poured the ointment on his head; but being deeply humbled under a &s;en&s;e of her unworthine&s;s &s;he could not approach her divine In&s;tructor with &s;o much freedom as to accompli&s;h her fir&s;t intention, but thought it more con&s;i&s;tent with her humility and &s;elf-aba&s;ement to anoint only his feet.</P>
<P>THE leper, who it &s;eems was a Phari&s;ee had attentively ob&s;erved the woman, and knowing her character, concluded that JESUS could not be a prophet. <HI>This man,</HI> &s;aid Simon to him&s;elf, <HI>if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is that touched him; for &s;he is a &s;inner.</HI> And &s;o full of pride and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency was the man, that he was offended at, and was ready to rebuke the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS for his deigning to take notice of and conver&s;ing with &s;uch contemptible characters: but our great Redeemer, to convince him that he was a prophet, and that he knew not only the character of the woman who had touched him, but was acquainted with the thoughts of all who thought mean of him in their hearts, began a conver&s;ation with him on the very &s;ubject he had been revolving in his mind. He did not expo&s;e his folly to the company by openly relating the &s;ecret thoughts of his heart, and in&s;i&s;ting on the ab&s;ur|dity of them, but with the utmo&s;t delicacy pointed out to Simon him&s;elf the unrea&s;ona|blene&s;s of the conclu&s;ion he had formed. <HI>Simon,</HI> &s;aid, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, <HI>I have &s;ome|what to &s;ay unto thee: there was a certain creditor which had two debtors, the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty; and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him mo&s;t. Simon an&s;wered and &s;aid, I &s;uppo&s;e that he to whom he forgave mo&s;t. And he &s;aid unto him, thou ha&s;t rightly judged.</HI> Our divine In&s;tructor then immediately applied this &s;hort parable to the cau&s;e of the woman, concerning whom the Phari&s;ee had &s;o unju&s;tly rea&s;oned in his heart. <HI>Simon,</HI> continued he, <HI>&s;ee&s;t thou this woman? I entered into thine hou&s;e, thou gave&s;t me no water for my feet; but
<PB N="73" REF="029927_0076_0FE3364DABE23120">
&s;he hath wa&s;hed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gave&s;t me no ki&s;s; but this woman &s;ince the time I came in hath not cea&s;ed to ki&s;s my feet. Mine head with oil thou did&s;t not anoint; but this woman hath anointed my feet with oint|ment, Wherefore, I &s;ay unto thee, her &s;ins, which are many, are forgiven; for &s;he loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the &s;ame loveth little.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Saviour having thus, with great delicacy, rebuked the unju&s;t and injurious &s;u&s;|picions of the Phari&s;ees, and vindicated his own character, as well as the conduct of the woman, who&s;e extraordinary kindne&s;s and tender affection were in no danger of lo&s;ing their reward from one who enjoyed the fine feelings of human nature in their highe&s;t perfection, now addre&s;&s;ed the woman with the &s;oul-reviving news, that her &s;ins were forgiven. But while her heart expanded with that holy gratitude and joy, which was in&s;pired by the great declaration, the Phari&s;ees beheld both our Redeemer and the woman with rancour, di&s;dain, and &s;ullen contempt: they could not endure the thought, that great &s;inners &s;hould be pardoned, and &s;et on a level with them&s;elves; nor could they be reconciled to the authority which our Redeemer had a&s;&s;umed; for being igno|rant of his divinity, they concluded that he had infringed on the prerogative of the Almighty, who only had a right to pardon &s;ins. But the great friend of &s;inners, re|gardle&s;s of their malicious murmurs, confirmed his gracious words, by repeating his a&s;&s;urances to the woman, adding, that her faith had &s;aved her, and bidding her depart in peace.</P>
<P>SOME little time after this, our great Redeemer departed from Capernaum and tra|velled through &s;ome parts of Galilee, going <HI>through every village, preaching and &s;hewing the glad-tidings of the kingdom of God,</HI> Luke viii.1. And after this &s;hort tour he prepared to go to Jeru&s;alem to eat the pa&s;&s;over; this being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e &s;econd fea&s;t of that kind &s;ince the commencement of his public mini&s;try. In this journey, he was accompanied by &s;everal pious women, among&s;t whom were Joanna the wife of Herod's &s;teward, Su&s;anna, Mary Magdalene, and various others, who had been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of devils, or cured of dange|rous and painful di&s;ea&s;es; &s;ome among&s;t them were per&s;ons of wealth, and were willing not only to acknowledge the great benefits they had received, but to make &s;uch returns as Providence had put in their power, and, therefore, they freely <HI>mini&s;tered to him of their &s;ub&s;tance.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CHRIST,</HI> being at Jeru&s;alem at the Time of the pa&s;&s;over, heals an impotant Man at the Pool of Beth&s;aida on the Sabbath-Day: He healeth one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a Devil, who was blind and dumb: He &s;heweth that Bla&s;phemy again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t is an unpardonable Sin: and &s;heweth whom he regardeth as his neare&s;t Relations. He alledgeth Scripture in excu&s;e of his Di&s;ciples, whom the Phari&s;ees charged with breaking the Sabbath in plucking the Ears of Corn on the Sabbath-Day: He appealeth to rea&s;on, and healeth the withered Hand on the Sabbath-Day.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NEAR the temple in Jeru&s;alem was a pool of water, into which ran the blood of the &s;acrifices, and the water which was u&s;ed by the prie&s;ts in preparing the victims, and on other occa&s;ions. This pool was called in the Hebrew tongue <HI>Beth&s;aida,</HI> that is, <HI>the hou&s;e of mercy.</HI> It was &s;urrounded by five porches, or cloi&s;ters, and the&s;e were filled
<PB N="74" REF="029927_0077_0FE336574B36D1B0">
with <HI>a great multitude of impotent folks, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain &s;ea&s;on and troubled the water: who&s;oever then fir&s;t, after the troubling of the water, &s;tepped in, was made whole of what&s;oever di&s;ea&s;e he had.</HI> The account of this miraculous pool is given us by the evangeli&s;t John, but is not men|tioned by any more of the &s;acred writers: and various que&s;tions have ari&s;en concerning th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e whonderful waters, which it hath been impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;olve, becau&s;e the pool of Beth&s;ada is not mentioned by any other Jewi&s;h writer, &s;acred or profane.</P>
<P>FOR the above rea&s;ons, it cannot be preci&s;ely determined, when this miraculous power of healing fir&s;t appeared in this pool; but it is almo&s;t univer&s;ally agreed, that it could not be long before the coming of our Redeemer; and that the miracle was intended to lead to the Son of God, and to prepare the nation for the reception of him. Nor is it &s;trange, that a healing virtue &s;hould attend tho&s;e waters, which were &s;tained with the blood of the &s;acrifices, which pointed to CHRIST, at the time when this great per&s;on was about to be manife&s;ted. The gift of prophecy, and that of miracles, had cea&s;ed among&s;t the Jews above four hundred years; and therefore, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, that this miraculous event would rou&s;e the attention of the nation, awaken every de&s;ire in their hearts for the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, and make them more circum&s;pect in ob&s;erving the tokens of his appear|ance. And as the Jewi&s;h nation, at this time, was under great tribulation and contempt, and oppre&s;&s;ion of the Gentiles, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the God of I&s;rael graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to give them this eminent token of his favour, and gave this wonderful heal|ing virtue to the&s;e blood-&s;tained waters, that they might not de&s;pair of the fulfilment of his ancient promi&s;es, but have an eye to the blood of the covenant, and expect the appear|ance of that great per&s;on, of whom I&s;aiah prophe&s;ied, <HI>He was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and brui&s;ed for our iniquities.</HI> And as God was plea&s;ed, at this time, to give &s;uch a won|derful healing virtue to a fountain of water, it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he de&s;igned to lead the minds of the devout wor&s;hippers in his temple to that great per&s;on, of whom it was prophe&s;ied that he &s;hould be <HI>a fountain opened for &s;in and uncleanne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>JESUS being come to Jeru&s;alem to the fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over, he repaired to the pool of Bethe&s;da, and took a view of the various &s;ubjects of di&s;ea&s;e, infirmity, and affliction, which crowded the porches, and waited for the troubling of the waters. Had the&s;e mi&s;erable objects applied to our great Redeemer for help, no doubt, they would all have experienced the great effects of that divine power of healing, which this illu&s;trious per&s;on &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: but it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he was ab&s;olutely unknown among&s;t them and no ble&s;&s;ing or benefit was expected from him. This may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the rea&s;on why our great Redeemer did not extend his heavenly goodne&s;s to the whole number of tho&s;e afflicted and di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons; for the general account which the evangeli&s;ts give of his divine compa&s;&s;ion on other occa&s;ions is, that <HI>he healed all who came to him.</HI> Such di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons who left their habitations, out of a per&s;ua&s;ion of his divine power and goodne&s;s, were the fir&s;t objects of his compa&s;&s;ion, and never returned without a cure; but the &s;ick at the pool of Bethe&s;da, were attentive to other means of relief, and thought not of the Redeemer of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>AMONGST the&s;e mi&s;erable objects, was a man who had laboured under his di&s;ea&s;e no le&s;s than thirty-eight years. The long continuance, as well as the di&s;tre&s;sful nature of this man's affliction, was well known to the Son of God; and among&s;t the great number of di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons which he beheld crowding the porches that &s;urrounded the pool, our exalted Saviour &s;ingled out this poor man as the object of his compa&s;&s;ion; and acco&s;ted him with this que&s;tion, <HI>Wilt thou be made whole?</HI> this que&s;tion &s;eemed de&s;igned to excite the attention of the people around, and to give the impotent man an opportunity of relating
<PB N="75" REF="029927_0078_0FE33659969061E8">
the malignant nature, and long continuance of his di&s;ea&s;e, and, of con&s;equence, making manife&s;t the divine power which could in&s;tantaneou&s;ly remove it. The infirm per&s;on, thinking the que&s;tion of our Lord had an immediate reference to the waters of the pool, replied, <HI>Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool; but while I am coming, another &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ppeth down before me.</HI> But our great Redeemer &s;oon convinced him, that he was not to receive his cure from the healing virtue of the waters, nor to wait till the angel came down to trouble them; but would receive immediate relief, by the mighty power of the Son of God, and, accordingly, bid him <HI>ari&s;e, take up his bed, and walk.</HI> The powerful words had no &s;ooner fallen from the lips of this divine per&s;on, than the great event took place. The impotent man felt a &s;udden warmth and vigour run through his relaxed nerves, and his feeble limbs a&s;&s;umed their youthful &s;trength; when, finding him&s;elf able to perform the command of his great benefactor, he made no &s;cruple of taking up his bed, and carrying it along the &s;treets, though it was the Sabbath-day.</P>
<P>SO great a miracle could not fail exciting the wonder of the &s;pectators; and the new cured man, carrying his bed through the city on the Sabbath-day, which was a thing not practi&s;ed by the Jews, and mu&s;t have a &s;trange appearance to the beholders, would not fail to &s;pread the account of this &s;urpri&s;ing event through the whole city. The man, who had &s;o wonderfully recovered the u&s;e of his limbs, did not &s;cruple to obey the commands of the Divine Phy&s;ician, though they were contrary to the cu&s;tom of his country, and would be likely to expo&s;e him to the blame of the Jews; he well knew, that a per&s;on who could perform &s;uch wonderful works, mu&s;t be a great prophet; and he &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch a per|&s;on would not order him to perform any action which was &s;inful, and therefore, regardle&s;s of the reproaches he met with from the Jews, he carried his bed through the &s;treets of the city. The Jews beheld him with a mixture of in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nation and contempt, and angrily told him, that it was not lawful for him to carry his bed on the Sabbath-day. But the man, elated by his happy deliverance, and holding his great benefactor in the highe&s;t e&s;teem, thought it &s;ufficient to an&s;wer, <HI>He that made me whole, the &s;ame &s;aid unto me, Take up thy bed and walk,</HI> John v.11. The Jews, not &s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, &s;harply inquired, who it was that had made him whole; which que&s;tion the man was not able to an&s;wer, as JESUS, as &s;oon as he had performed the miracle, had mixed with the crowd, and was imperceivably departed from them.</P>
<P>SOME time after this, the per&s;on who had thus been miraculou&s;ly re&s;tored, met with the Divine Phy&s;ician in the temple, who took the opportunity to impre&s;s on his mind, a &s;en&s;e of the great benefit he had received, and the obligations he lay under to amendment of life: <HI>Behold thou art made whole,</HI> &s;aid our great Redeemer, <HI>&s;in no more, le&s;t a wor&s;e thing come unto thee.</HI> The evangeli&s;t has not informed us what effect this admonition had on the per&s;on who had been healed; but having, by this event, found out his great benefactor, he, no doubt, expecting the whole nation would revere &s;o extraordinary a per&s;on, went to the ruler of the Jews, and told them, that <HI>it was Je&s;us who had made him whole.</HI></P>
<P>THIS information had a very different effect than what might be expected; the pride and ob&s;tinacy of the rulers of I&s;rael, prevented their conviction, and their inveterate preju|dices blinded their eyes, &s;o that every manife&s;tation of divine power was lo&s;t on them: for in&s;tead of reverencing the Redeemer of I&s;rael, and rejoicing that God had remembered his people, they tumultuou&s;ly attacked him in the temple, and, probably, carried him before the Sanhedrim, with an intention to take away his life, becau&s;e he had done good on the Sabbath-day. Our great Redeemer, in an&s;wer to their calumny, ob&s;erved, that by doing good on the Sabbath-day, he acted con&s;i&s;tent with the conduct of his heavenly Father, who, as Supreme Governor of the univer&s;e, carried on the order of nature, and

&s;upplied the wants of his numerous creatures, without di&s;tinction of days; and who&s;e providence is con&s;tantly employed in doing good to the &s;ons of men without intermi&s;&s;ion, or regard to times and &s;ea&s;ons. But the Jews were not to be convinced by argument, they cheri&s;hed in their minds a growing rancour, and an implacable hatred to the Son of God; &s;o that what he had ob&s;erved, in&s;tead of compo&s;ing their minds, only tended to irritate and inflame them: and they attacked him with mortal hatred, and all the virulence of abu&s;e, and &s;tood determined to take away his life becau&s;e <HI>he not only had broken the Sabbath, but had &s;aid that God was his Father; making him&s;elf equal with God.</HI></P>
<P>HAD the Jews been wrong in this conclu&s;ion, that CHRIST, in the account which he gave of him&s;elf, made him&s;elf equal with God, no doubt that divine per&s;on, in whom dwelt eternal truth, would have &s;et them to rights in a matter of &s;uch high importance, which &s;o nearly concerned him&s;elf, and which he was the only proper per&s;on to explain. But we find, that the following di&s;cour&s;e of our great Redeemer, did not tend to di&s;|credit &s;uch a conclu&s;ion, but to e&s;tabli&s;h and enforce it. He begins with ob&s;erving, that &s;o clo&s;e is the connection, and &s;uch the equality between him&s;elf and the Father, that the &s;ame works which are a&s;cribed to one, may be properly a&s;cribed to the other. <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you,</HI> &s;aid our great Redeemer, <HI>the Son can do nothing him&s;elf, but what he &s;eeth the Father do: for what things &s;oever he doeth, the&s;e al&s;o doeth the Son likewi&s;e: for the Father loveth the Son, and &s;heweth him all things, that him&s;elf doeth; and he will &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w him greater works than the&s;e, that ye may marvel.</HI> From this te&s;timony which the Son of God bears to his own divinity, it is evident, that all men &s;hould honour the Son as they honour the Father, and that the &s;tupendous works of creation, providence, and grace, may be ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to our dear Immanuel: and him we may adore, as the Great Maker, the All-wi&s;e and All-potent P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;erver, the Great Supreme Governor, and Judge of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Saviour of the world then proceeded to refer to tho&s;e particular works which manife&s;ted him to be the Son of God, and, of con&s;equence, by their own conclu&s;ion, equal with the Father; and in this view, he mentions the manife&s;tation of his divine power in rai&s;ing the dead: <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear &s;hall live. For as the Father hath life in him&s;elf, &s;o he hath given to the Son, to have life in him&s;elf: and hath given him authority to execute judgment al&s;o, becau&s;e he is the Son of man.</HI> The evidence of the divinity of the Saviour of the world, ari&s;es not only from the divine power which he manife&s;ted in rai&s;ing the natural dead, but was al&s;o abundantly manife&s;t by his divine power, exerted in rai&s;ing dead &s;inners; which is a work which can be effected by nothing le&s;s than the mighty power of God; and to which the&s;e remarkable words &s;eem to allude.</P>
<P>BUT our great Redeemer proceeds further to a&s;&s;ert and enforce his own divinity, and equality with his Father, by ob&s;erving, that to him is a&s;&s;igned the great work of &s;itting in judgment, and fixing the eternal &s;tate of all mankind. <HI>Marvel not at this,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves &s;hall come forth: they that have done good, to the re&s;urrection of life, and they that have done evil, to the re&s;urrection of damnation. And my judgment is ju&s;t, becau&s;e I &s;eek not mine own will, but the will of my Father who &s;ent me.</HI> In that great and terrible day, the fate of a falling world will be decided by Unerring Wi&s;dom, and the invariable rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s: for the great Judge of heaven and earth, hath a full and clear perception of every action which has been per|formed from the beginning to the end of time; and he is ab&s;olutely impartial and un|bia&s;&s;ed, having no inclination to &s;atisfy, no end to pur&s;ue, different from tho&s;e of his heavenly Father.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="029927_0080_0FE3365CD0FED098">THE great Saviour of the world, as a further confirmation of his divinity, appealed to the te&s;timony of John, to whom the Phari&s;ees had formerly &s;ent a deputation to know his opinion of CHRIST. Our Lord ob&s;erved, that <HI>he was a burning and a &s;hining light,</HI> in which, for a time, the Jews greatly rejoiced, and they had cau&s;e to rejoice, becau&s;e the prophetic &s;pirit, which had &s;o long cea&s;ed in I&s;rael, had been revived in that holy man; and he had given a full and clear te&s;timony, that JESUS was the Son of God: but our Redeemer proceeded to a greater te&s;timony than that of John, which was no other than God him&s;elf, who, by his miracles which he daily directed him to perform, was bearing a con&s;tant witne&s;s to the truth of his divinity, and had by an audible voice at his bapti&s;m, declared him to be his well-beloved Son; a voice which multitudes of people had heard, and perhaps &s;ome of tho&s;e to whom he was now &s;peaking.</P>
<P>AND for a further confirmation of the great truth he had been maintaining, our Lord, as a means to &s;trike a full conviction in the minds of the Jews, with whom he was conver|&s;ing, appealed to their own Scriptures: <HI>Search the Scriptures; for in them ye have eternal life: and they are they which te&s;tify of me.</HI> But notwith&s;tanding the clearne&s;s of the ancient prophecies, and the remarkable manner in which they de&s;cribed and pointed out the Saviour of &s;inners, that unhappy nation was &s;o blinded by their prejudices and vices, that they could not believe. The Jews had long expected the Me&s;&s;iah to appear among&s;t them, but they had formed very different conceptions of his appearance, than the de&s;igns of heaven, or the de&s;criptions of their prophets. The Scribes and Phari&s;ees had long amu&s;ed them&s;elves, and filled the minds of the people with grand and magnificent ideas of the Me&s;&s;iah's king|dom; they had repre&s;ented him as a potent prince, who was to be adorned with all the en&s;igns of power, and the glory of &s;overeign greatne&s;s; he was to &s;it on the throne of his father David, and rai&s;e it in power, greatne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, glory, grandeur, and magnificence, above all the kingdoms of the earth. Hence it was, that they could not acknowledge JESUS as their Me&s;&s;iah; they took offence at the meanne&s;s of his appearance; and though the mighty works which he performed, fully manife&s;ted the truth of his mi&s;&s;ion, and were &s;ufficient to convince every impartial and unprejudiced mind, that he was really the Me&s;&s;iah; yet the pride of that infatuated nation, could not &s;toop &s;o low as to acknow|ledge him: nor could their teachers, who had filled their minds with &s;uch va&s;t expectations of temporal greatne&s;s, conde&s;cend to confe&s;s them&s;elves &s;o much mi&s;taken in the meaning of the prophets.</P>
<P>BUT to conclude this di&s;cour&s;e, our Lord proceeded to ob&s;erve that he him&s;elf &s;hould not be their only accu&s;er to his Father, but they would be condemned for their infide|lity by their great legi&s;lator, Mo&s;es, on whom they tru&s;ted as their invariable friend. <HI>Do not think,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that I will accu&s;e you to the Father; there is one that accu&s;eth you, even Mo&s;es, in whom ye tru&s;t: for had ye believed Mo&s;es, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me: but if ye believe not his writings, how &s;hall ye believe my word?</HI></P>
<P>WITH &s;uch ob&s;ervations and arguments as the&s;e, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS combated the pride and prejudice of the Jewi&s;h nation, and proved him&s;elf to be the Son of God, the great Judge of the whole earth, and the Me&s;&s;iah promi&s;ed by the ancient prophets; and &s;o plain and convincing were the proofs and arguments he brought, that his adver&s;aries could not reply: but though they were &s;ilenced by the wi&s;dom of his words, their old prejudices remained; and their being baffled and overcome in every conte&s;t, filled them with a growing rancour and &s;ettled hatred to his per&s;on, which &s;hewed it&s;elf on every occa&s;ion, and proceeded &s;o far as to induce them to endeavour to take away his life.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="029927_0081_0FE336688FD2A4D8">NOR was it long before the proud and envious Scribes and Phari&s;ees found a fre&s;h opportunity to exclaim again&s;t our great Redeemer, and pur&s;ue him with their imperti|nent objections and cavils; for going with his train through the corn-fields on the Sabbath-day, his di&s;ciples plucked the ears of corn and eat the grain, after rubbing it in their hands, and the Phari&s;ees with the utmo&s;t &s;everity and bitterne&s;s exclaimed again&s;t this as a profanation of the Sabbath. Our Lord, in reply to this calumny reminded them of the conduct of David, who, in a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, when he fled from Saul, permitted his &s;ervants, and pre&s;umed him&s;elf, to eat of the &s;hew-bread which was kept in the taber|nacle, and was not lawful for any to eat but the prie&s;ts; and further to convince them of the folly of their remarks, our Lord referred them to the conduct of their own prie&s;ts, who con&s;tantly performed the nece&s;&s;ary work of the temple on the Sabbath-day: from whence it appears, that works of nece&s;&s;ity had been always permitted on the Sabbath-day, though it was contrary to the command of the law. Our Lord further ob&s;erved, that it was nece&s;&s;ary the Scribes and Phari&s;ees &s;hould know that <HI>the Son of man was Lord of the Sabbath:</HI> for as the work which him&s;elf and his di&s;ciples con&s;tantly attended to was promoting the eternal intere&s;t of mankind, they had a greater right to claim an exemption from the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the Sabbath than the prie&s;ts in the tem|ple, who were only concerned in the practice of ritual ob&s;ervances, could pretend to. And in the conclu&s;ion of this di&s;cour&s;e, our great Redeemer took notice, that acts of mercy &s;hould always be performed, though they were attended with the violation of &s;ome of the &s;acred in&s;titutions of the ceremonial law; for it would be inverting the order of nature, and rever&s;ing the immutable rules of rea&s;on and the nature of things, to &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>man was made for the Sabbath, and not the Sabbath for the u&s;e and benefit of man.</HI></P>
<P>SOON after this debate with the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour entered one of the &s;ynagogues of Jeru&s;alem on the Sabbath day, and in the a&s;&s;embly there was a man who&s;e right hand was withered.</P>
<P>THE Phari&s;ees rightly concluded that &s;uch an object of di&s;tre&s;s would excite the com|pa&s;&s;ion of that divine phy&s;ician, who had &s;o often exerted the wonderful power he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in behalf of the helple&s;s and mi&s;erable: and, ob&s;erving that JESUS took particular notice of the infirm per&s;on, they watched him with all the keenne&s;s and rancour of the mo&s;t inveterate malice, concluding that they &s;hould now have an opportunity of accu&s;ing him to the people as a breaker of the Sabbath. So full of pride and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency was this hypocritical generation, and &s;o greatly they valued them&s;elves on the exact performance of external ceremonies, that they could openly accu&s;e our great Redeemer of a capital offence for healing the di&s;ea&s;ed on the Sabbath-day: but &s;o blind and &s;tupid were the&s;e doctors of the law, that they could not &s;ee that them&s;elves were profaning and polluting that &s;acred day of re&s;t, by indulging the mo&s;t diabolical di&s;po&s;itions, and practi&s;ing the mo&s;t attrocious actions which could be committed. Such was their endeavouring to de|&s;troy a virtuous and innocent per&s;on, who had never injured them, who&s;e conduct and character demanded the highe&s;t re&s;pect, and who&s;e life was &s;pent in promoting the be&s;t intere&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>THE Saviour of the world was not unacquainted with their deadly malice, nor their pre&s;ent intentions to take an advantage of his heavenly goodne&s;s; he knew the rancour of their hearts; he penetrated their deepe&s;t de&s;igns; and unmoved by their impotent rage, he ordered the per&s;on to &s;tand up in the full view of the whole congregation, and publicly avowed his de&s;ign to heal him.</P>
<P>THE hypocritical teachers of I&s;rael exclaimed again&s;t the beneficent action he was about to perform, as an impious and unlawful profanation of the Sabbath. <HI>Is it,</HI> &s;aid
<PB N="79" REF="029927_0082_0FE3366A16776F30">
they, <HI>lawful to heal on the &s;abbath-day?</HI> It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that, by this exclamation, they de&s;igned to prevent the performance of the miracle, but rather to draw from our great Redeemer &s;uch an an&s;wer as they might take advantage of, and which might give them an opportunity to accu&s;e him with the greater &s;ucce&s;s: but our Lord an&s;wered them in &s;uch a manner as let them know that he penetrated their deepe&s;t de&s;igns, and at the &s;ame time baffled and confounded their utmo&s;t rage. <HI>Is it,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>lawful to do good on the Sabbath-day, or to do evil? To &s;ave life, or to de&s;troy it?</HI> Is it lawful for you, ye mo&s;t dete&s;table hypocrites, to harbour in your minds the mo&s;t infernal rancour and hatred again&s;t me; and with the highe&s;t inju&s;tice and cruelty to plot again&s;t my life on the Sabbath-day? And is it not lawful for me to re&s;tore to his former &s;trength, this poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed man who &s;tands before you? The ju&s;tice and &s;everity of this rebuke &s;truck them dumb; and, not being able to reply, they pretended not to under&s;tand his meaning: but to leave them without excu&s;e, our Lord made u&s;e of an argument which &s;tupidity it&s;elf could not mi&s;take, and which all the &s;ophi&s;try of the&s;e hypocritical teachers was not able to evade. <HI>What man,</HI> &s;aid our exalted Saviour, <HI>&s;hall there be amongst you, who &s;hall have one &s;heep, and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath-day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a &s;heep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath-day.</HI></P>
<P>THIS plain reference to their own practice was &s;o clear and convincing, that they could not pretend to be ignorant of it; and &s;o full that they were effectually &s;ilenced though they were determined not to be convinced. This wicked perver&s;ene&s;s and un|conquerable ob&s;tinacy, grieved the &s;pirit of the meek and lowly, the kind and benevolent Son of God, who looking round on his enemies with a mixture of compa&s;&s;ion and &s;orrow, kindly commanded the lame man to &s;tretch out his hand: the man gladly obeyed, and in&s;tantly it was re&s;tored whole as the other.</P>
<P>THIS a&s;toni&s;hing work, our great Redeemer performed in a large congregation in the full view of all the people, in whom the foregoing di&s;pute had rai&s;ed a curio&s;ity to behold the event; and as, no doubt, it was performed on a per&s;on that frequented the &s;yna|gogue, mo&s;t of the per&s;ons there pre&s;ent were acquainted with the man, while he la|boured under this infirmity, and &s;eeing JESUS in &s;uch a &s;ituation in the mid&s;t of his mo&s;t inveterate enemies, it mu&s;t certainly have a great effect on the minds of the beholders, e&s;pecially as they &s;aw that it had effectually &s;ilenced the Phari&s;ees, who had nothing to offer, either again&s;t the miracle it&s;elf, the proofs and rea&s;onings urged for the fitne&s;s and propriety of it, or the divine power of him who had performed it.</P>
<P>BUT though the&s;e proud, envious, and hypocritical teachers were a&s;toni&s;hed at the miracles, and &s;ilenced by the arguments of the Son of God, yet they were far from giving up their unju&s;t and cruel in&s;titutions: for though they bore an inveterate hatred to the Sadducees and Herodians becau&s;e they pre&s;umed to differ from them in their religious &s;entiments, yet they could join with the&s;e per&s;ons they &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed, and con&s;ult with them in order to take away his life.</P>
<P>FOR they well knew that if he continued the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try, and produced &s;uch inconte&s;tible evidences of divine power, the people would follow him; when their own weight and influence would quickly decline, and their preaching become contemptible. JESUS well knew their wicked de&s;igns, yet he did not think proper at this time, any further to oppo&s;e them, but retired into Galilee, to the borders of the lake of Chinnereth.</P>
<P>THIS retreat of our great Redeemer &s;eems to have di&s;plea&s;ed &s;ome of his di&s;ciples, who had &s;trongly imbibed the popular idea of the Me&s;&s;iah's temporal kingdom, and expected
<PB N="80" REF="029927_0083_0FE3366B9DDD8200">
that he would have e&s;tabli&s;hed his authority by force, and exerted his divine power to bear down all oppo&s;ition; and they were extremely mortified to find their Ma&s;ter give way, and &s;eem to decline any further conte&s;t. But the ob&s;curity of his retreat could not conceal him from the multitudes who flocked to him from all quarters, bringing with them their &s;ick and di&s;ea&s;ed; and his heavenly goodne&s;s healed them all. Nor would the di&s;ciples have been offended at this mild and peaceable conduct of their Ma&s;ter, had they attentively con&s;idered the prophecy of I&s;aiah, where this peaceable di&s;po&s;ition is particu|larly in&s;i&s;ted on as eminently di&s;tingui&s;hing the character of the Me&s;&s;iah. <HI>Behold my &s;ervant whom I have cho&s;en; my beloved, in whom my &s;oul is well plea&s;ed: I will put my &s;pirit upon him, he &s;hall &s;hew judgment to the Gentiles. He &s;hall not &s;trive, nor cry; neither &s;hall any man hear his voice in the &s;treets. A brui&s;ed reed &s;hall he not break, and &s;moaking flax he &s;hall not quench, till he &s;end forth judgment unto victory. And in his name &s;hall the Gentiles tru&s;t.</HI> Matthew xii.12, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE &s;mall variations between this prophecy, as quoted by St. Matthew, and the original in the book of I&s;aiah, are of no con&s;equence, as the &s;en&s;e is the &s;ame; and here it may be worthy of remark, that this prophecy de&s;cribes the publication of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion by JESUS CHRIST, va&s;tly different from that of the Jewi&s;h religion by Mo&s;es. The law of Mo&s;es was publi&s;hed with thunder and fire, and the &s;tronge&s;t circum&s;tances of terror from mount Sinai, and only extended to the &s;ingle nation of the I&s;raelites: the doctrine of &s;alvation, as publi&s;hed by the Me&s;&s;iah, was mild, peaceable, and gentle, and was extended to every nation and people under heaven. Accordingly, our Lord, by retiring to Galilee, fulfilled the fir&s;t part of this famous prophecy, <HI>He &s;hall &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w judgment to the Gentiles;</HI> for we are informed by the evangeli&s;t that great multitudes came to him from beyond Jordan, and from Syria, and from the countries about Tyre and Sidon.</P>
<P>WHILE our Lord remained in Galilee, there was brought unto him a blind and dumb man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a devil; but he, with a &s;ingle word, ca&s;t out the evil &s;pirit, and imme|diately re&s;tored to the poor man the noble faculties of &s;ight and &s;peech. An event &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, &s;o miraculous, and &s;o &s;uddenly wrought, could not fail of exciting the a&s;toni&s;hment of the beholder; and the hone&s;t plain-hearted part of the nation were inclined to believe. But the Phari&s;ees, who had followed him from Jeru&s;alem with the ba&s;e&s;t intentions, were filled with the mo&s;t tormenting envy at &s;eeing him perform &s;uch &s;ur|pri&s;ing miracles and burning with all the rage of di&s;appointed malice, contrary to all the rules of rea&s;on and the conviction of their own minds, impudently and wickedly a&s;cribed his miracles to the power of the devil: an affirmation &s;o horrid, abominable, and de&s;pe|rately wicked, could not e&s;cape the notice, or fail of exciting the &s;harp rebukes of the Son of God; who addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf both to his enemies and the &s;urrounding multitude, de|mon&s;trated the ab&s;urdity and impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a conclu&s;ion from the common affairs of life. <HI>Every kingdom</HI> &s;aid the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, <HI>divided again&s;t it&s;elf &s;hall not &s;tand: and if Satan ca&s;t out Satan, he is divided again&s;t him&s;elf: how then &s;hall his kingdom &s;tand?</HI> How fooli&s;h and ridiculous is it to &s;uppo&s;e that the Devil would act again&s;t him&s;elf, and undermine the foundations of his own kingdom! To which our great Redeemer thought fit to add, <HI>If I by Belzebub ca&s;t out devils, by whom do your children ca&s;t them out? Therefore they &s;hall be your judges. But if I ca&s;t out devils by the Spirit of God, then is the kingdom of God come unto you.</HI> You did not impute the miracles of your prophets to Belzebub but received them on the evidence of the&s;e miracles as the me&s;&s;engers of God: but ye reject me, who work greater and more numerous miracles than they, and impute them to the power of the Devil. Is this conduct con&s;i&s;tent; or is it po&s;&s;ible to reconcile it to rea&s;on or common &s;en&s;e? The&s;e prophets therefore &s;hall be your judges; and they &s;hall condemn you. But if it is
<PB N="81" REF="029927_0084_0FE3366D22F1DCA0">
true, that I ca&s;t out devils by the Almighty Power and Spirit of God, it follows, that the kingdom of God &s;o long expected, and ardently de&s;ired, is going to be e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t you. Is not the horrid impudence of this bla&s;phemy of yours really a&s;toni&s;hing! But, great as your crime is, it may yet be forgiven; becau&s;e fuller and more manife&s;t evidences of the truth of my mi&s;&s;ion, may hereafter convince you of your wickedne&s;s, and excite you to believe; and the time is coming, when the Son of man &s;hall be rai&s;ed from the dead, and the gift of miracles by the power of the Holy Gho&s;t will be be&s;towed on almo&s;t every believer. The nature of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom will be more fully explained, and &s;uch proofs given, as if attended to, will be abundantly &s;ufficient to remove your prejudices and overcome your ob&s;tinacy and prevailing unbelief. But if you then &s;hut your eyes, and &s;peak evil again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, contrary to the conviction of your minds, maliciou&s;ly a&s;cribing the miracles wrought by his power, and his extraordinary gifts, to proceed from the prince of darkne&s;s, you have wilfully &s;hut your eyes again&s;t the light; you have dared to in&s;ult the eternal God to his face; you have re&s;i&s;ted, wilfully re&s;i&s;ted, the la&s;t means which he will u&s;e to convince you: and you never will be forgiven, but &s;hall &s;urely fall under the fiercene&s;s of his wrath, both in this world, and that which is to come. <HI>Where|fore I &s;ay unto you, all manner of &s;in and bla&s;phemy &s;hall be forgiven unto men: but the bla&s;phemy again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t &s;hall not be forgiven unto men. And who&s;oever &s;peaketh a word again&s;t the Son of man, it &s;hall be forgiven him: but who&s;oever &s;peaketh again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, it &s;hall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</HI></P>
<P>THE awful and alarming denunciation again&s;t the bla&s;phemy of the Holy Gho&s;t, was pro|bably laid down by our Saviour at this time, to appri&s;e the Phari&s;ees of their danger, to awaken them to a &s;en&s;e of their ob&s;tinate and envious oppo&s;ition to the truth, and make them afraid of the con&s;equence, if they per&s;i&s;ted in &s;uch dete&s;table calumnies, when their own hearts told them, that they had no foundation in rea&s;on, but what flowed from malice and re&s;entments: but the mo&s;t powerful arguments, or the mo&s;t awful threatenings, had no effect on this ob&s;tinate and perver&s;e race of mortals, who &s;arca&s;tically an&s;wered, <HI>Ma&s;ter, we would &s;ee a &s;ign from thee.</HI> What a&s;toni&s;hing &s;tupidity! Had he no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the moment before, ca&s;t out a devil, and re&s;tored the faculties of &s;ight and &s;peech to the blind and dumb! Had not he clean&s;ed lepers, rai&s;ed the dead, and rebuked the tempe&s;tuous winds, and raging waves of the &s;ea! Were not the&s;e &s;igns &s;ufficient to have convinced the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and bigot|ted mortal! What therefore could the&s;e &s;tubborn doctors of the law require! Well might the great Saviour of the world call them <HI>a wicked and adulterous generation;</HI> for certainly they could ju&s;tly pretend to no part of the faith and piety of their great father Abraham; he believed God, and, it was imputed to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s: but they, by their malici|ous ob&s;tinacy, and determined unbelief, added &s;in to &s;in, and plunged them&s;elves into the depth of iniquity and wickedne&s;s. Per&s;ons of &s;uch perver&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, and incorrigible tempers, merited no indulgence; and, therefore, our great Redeemer told them, that no &s;ign &s;hould be given them, but that of the prophet Jonah, who, by laying three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, was a type of the Son of God, who &s;hould continue three days and three nights in the chambers of the grave.</P>
<P>OUR Lord then proceeded to ob&s;erve, that the ob&s;tinacy, perver&s;ene&s;s, and wickedne&s;s of that generation, was greater than that of the mo&s;t barbarous, ignorant, and idolatrous nations, who would ri&s;e in judgment with them and condemn them.</P>
<P>THE people of Nineveh repented at the preaching of Jonah; and the queen of the South took a long journey to behold the wi&s;dom of Solomon: but the ob&s;tinate, wicked, and unbelieving Jews, would not repent at the preaching, and repeated warnings of the Son of God, nor learn wi&s;dom from the Eternal Fountain of Wi&s;dom it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="029927_0085_0FE336780AAA1270">OUR Lord then concluded his di&s;cour&s;e with a parable, which &s;hewed the great danger of wilfully oppo&s;ing and re&s;i&s;ting the truth, as &s;uch practices tend to make men habitually and de&s;perately wicked, and, in every re&s;pect, more obdurate and abandoned than before.</P>
<P>DURING this di&s;pute with the rulers of I&s;rael, JESUS was informed, that his mother and his kin&s;men waited without, de&s;iring an interview with him; upon which, with a look of the tendere&s;t affection, he &s;tretched out his hand towards his di&s;ciples, and &s;aid, <HI>Behold my mother and my brethern! for who&s;oever &s;hall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the &s;ame is my brother, and &s;i&s;ter, and mother,</HI> Matt. xii.49, 50. The&s;e remarkable words ought to be received with the warme&s;t gratitude, and the mo&s;t exalted joy, by every Chri&s;tian; &s;ince from this divine declaration, it may be learnt, that a faith in CHRIST, which works by love, and produces a conformity to the precepts of the go&s;pel, gives the believer a claim to the high title of a Son of the Mo&s;t High, and a near relation to his dear Redeemer: by this divine principle, the believer lays hold on the ble&s;&s;ings and privileges which belong to his &s;piritual birth, he claims a kindred to the &s;kies, he becomes acquainted with his union with the Divine Nature, and can &s;tand before the throne of the Eternal God, and call him his Father.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>JESUS</HI> delivers &s;everal Parables from a Ship, to the Multitudes that were &s;tanding on Shore: He receives a &s;econd Vi&s;it from his Relations: At Evening he retires to Capernaum, and delivers more Parables to his Di&s;ciples: Afterwards, he returns to Nazareth, his own City, and &s;ends his Apo|&s;tles to preach about that Country: He then repairs to the De&s;ert of Beth&s;aida and provides a miraculous Repa&s;t for the whole Multitude.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE public debate in which JESUS was engaged with the Phari&s;ees, and the miracle which was the occa&s;ion of it, brought together &s;uch a va&s;t concour&s;e of people, that, for the greater facility of in&s;tructing them, our great Redeemer repaired to the &s;ea-&s;ide. The crowd pre&s;&s;ed &s;o clo&s;e about him, that he was incommoded in his office of &s;peaking, and for the greater conveniency, he entered a &s;hip, and put off to &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hore, while the attentive multitudes remained on dry land: being thus conveniently ac|commodated for public &s;peaking, our divine In&s;tructor proceeded to lay down &s;everal pre|cepts of the utmo&s;t importance, which he thought proper to introduce in the parabolical &s;tile. This was a mode of in&s;truction very common in the Oriental nations, and it was the general method of the old prophets, John the Bapti&s;t, and our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, to inculcate divine and moral truths, in the beautiful method of allu&s;ion and fable; and &s;ometimes &s;o to contrive the di&s;cour&s;e, that it had an immediate reference to tho&s;e objects, which at that very time pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the view of the audience. This method of in&s;tructing was, on &s;everal accounts, particularly adapted to the de&s;igns of divine conduct, and the circum|&s;tances of the Jewi&s;h nation, at the time of the Me&s;&s;iah's appearance. Similitudes of this kind, are the mo&s;t ea&s;y and &s;imple methods of teaching; they are be&s;t accommodated to the apprehen&s;ions of the ignorant and unlearned, and are very ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, re|membered, and applied at the &s;ame time, they are the fine&s;t veil for my&s;teries, and the be&s;t medium for concealing from the proud and ob&s;tinate, tho&s;e truths which their perver&s;ene&s;s and infidelity render them unworthy of having more clearly revealed.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;eem to be alluded to by our great Redeemer him&s;elf, when his di&s;|ciples a&s;ked, why he taught the people in parables? <HI>Becau&s;e,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>it is given unto you to
<PB N="83" REF="029927_0086_0FE3367A5C6005D8">
know the my&s;teries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it is not given: for who&s;oever hath, to him &s;hall be given, and he &s;hall have more abundance: but who&s;oever hath not, from him &s;hall be taken away, even that he hath. Therefore, &s;peak I unto them in parables; becau&s;e, in &s;eeing they &s;ee not: and in hearing they hear not, neither do they under&s;tand,</HI> Matt. xiii.11, &amp;c. The be|loved di&s;ciples, whom our Redeemer, by his divine power, had made of an humble, teach|able di&s;po&s;ition, who&s;e minds, by an heavenly influence, were become docile, apt to learn, and open to in&s;truction, were thus addre&s;&s;ed by the divine In&s;tructor, and he gives them to under&s;tand, that it would be no advantage to them, nor to any that &s;incerely de&s;ired to be in&s;tructed, and attended on him in humility of heart, that the truths he delivered were clothed in parables; for &s;uch per&s;ons would carefully con&s;ider his words, and re&s;ort to him for their explanation: and the truths them&s;elves, clothed in this beautiful veil, would be more attractive to the humble inquiring mind: and, when carefully con&s;idered, appear plain, &s;imple, and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>BUT the proud, &s;elf-conceited Scribes and Phari&s;ees, were &s;o blinded by their prejudices, that they would not give them&s;elves time to con&s;ider, but would heartily de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch me|thods of teaching, and condemn, as low and contemptible, the plain allu&s;ions in which the divine truths were repre&s;ented. Our great Redeemer did not alter his manner of teach|ing, for their &s;akes, but dre&s;&s;ed the great truths of the go&s;pel in &s;uch metaphorical robes as they did heartily de&s;pi&s;e, and which would for ever conceal them from per&s;ons of their temper and conduct. Nor need it be wondered at, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS further ob&s;erved: that he took this method with this &s;ort of men; for it had been prophe&s;ied of him, that he &s;hould <HI>open his mouth in parables, and utter things which had been kept &s;ecret from the foundation of the world.</HI> And concerning the pride, ob&s;tinacy, perver&s;ene&s;s, and infidelity of the ru|lers of the Jews, I&s;aiah had long ago prophe&s;ied to them, that, <HI>by hearing ye &s;hall hear, and not under&s;tand; and &s;eeing ye &s;hall &s;ee, and &s;hall not perceive: for this peoples heart is waxed gro&s;s, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have clo&s;ed: le&s;t at any time they &s;hould &s;ee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and &s;hould under&s;tand with their heart, and &s;hould be converted, and I &s;hould heal them.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is &s;ome little variation between the words, as quoted by our Saviour, and tho&s;e found in the prophecy of I&s;aiah, but the meaning is the &s;ame in each, and the &s;en&s;e mani|fe&s;tly is, that the Jewi&s;h nation &s;hould hear the doctrines of the go&s;pel, but not under&s;tand them: and &s;ee the miracles wrought in confirmation of the truth of tho&s;e doctrines but not perceive them to be wrought by the power of God: not becau&s;e the evidences produced by our great Redeemer, were in&s;ufficent to convince a judicious and impartial inquirer af|ter truth; but becau&s;e the corruption and depravity of the hearts of the proud Phari&s;ees, would not &s;uffer them to examine and weigh the&s;e evidences; for the &s;ins of that people had hardened their hearts, their pride and vanity had &s;hut their ears, and their hypocri&s;y and bigotted adherence to tradition, and forced interpretations of the law, had clo&s;ed their eyes; &s;o that the bright rays of divine truth could not &s;hine upon their dark minds, nor the powerful voice of heavenly wi&s;dom, awaken their attention, or command their a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>SUCH were the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned by our great Redeemer, for his teaching the people in pa|rables; and then he proceeded to remind his di&s;ciples of the great privileges they enjoyed, in having the opportunity of learning, from his heavenly lips, tho&s;e things which the pro|phets of old &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired to know and under&s;tand: <HI>But ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>are your eyes, for they &s;ee; and your ears, for they hear: for verily I &s;ay unto you, that many prophets and righ|teous men have de&s;ired to &s;ee tho&s;e things which ye &s;ee, and have not &s;een them; and to hear tho&s;e things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t parable which the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS delivered to the multitude, was that of the &s;ower, who ca&s;t his &s;eed into different kinds of &s;oil, the product of which was an&s;werable
<PB N="84" REF="029927_0087_0FE3367BE1362AB0">
to the nature of the ground; &s;ome yielding a large increa&s;e and &s;ome none at all; by which he elegantly di&s;played the &s;ucce&s;s of his own doctrine, among&s;t the &s;everal kinds of hearers to which it would be preached. <HI>A &s;ower,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>went forth to &s;ow; and when he &s;owed, &s;ome &s;eeds fell by the way &s;ide, and the fowls came and devoured them up: &s;ome fell upon &s;tony places, where they had not much earth; and forthwith they &s;prung up, becau&s;e they had no deepne&s;s of earth; and when the &s;un was up, they were &s;corched; and becau&s;e they had no root, they withered away. And &s;ome fell among thorns, and the thorns &s;prung up and choaked them; but others fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, &s;ome an hundred fold, &s;ome &s;ixty fold, &s;ome thirty fold.</HI></P>
<P>THIS parable was peculiarly proper to be con&s;idered by the multitudes who attended on the Son of God, when &s;uch va&s;t numbers heard his di&s;cour&s;es, and &s;o few practi&s;ed his precepts, or profited by the heavenly doctrines which he taught. Not only the multitude, but the di&s;ciples heard him with a mixture of plea&s;ure and &s;urpri&s;e; and, not under&s;tanding his meaning, they were impatient to hear it explained; and were very urgent to know, why he cho&s;e that method of in&s;truction.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t of the&s;e que&s;tions, our Lord an&s;wered in the manner before related; and then, with conde&s;cending kindne&s;s, proceeded to give them the explanation of the para|ble of the &s;ower: <HI>When any one,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>heareth the word of the kingdom, and under&s;tandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was &s;own in his heart. This is he which received the &s;eed by the way &s;ide.</HI> The per&s;ons who are here repre&s;ented as hearing the word of God without under&s;tanding, are tho&s;e carele&s;s hearers, who&s;e minds are diverted from attending to tho&s;e things which concern their everla&s;ting peace, by the gay, trifling amu&s;ements and alluring objects of &s;en&s;e. Such per&s;ons hear the word of God with &s;o little attention, that they &s;carcely know what they hear; and, for want of an habit of &s;erious thinking, their ideas are loo&s;e and &s;cattered, and an univer&s;al di&s;&s;ipation of mind drives out all &s;olid reflection. Such per&s;ons as the&s;e, are at all times proper objects for the great enemy of mankind to work upon; he well knows how to take advantage of the vacancy of thought, which expo&s;es &s;uch minds to his malicious attempts; and, where he finds the mind empty, he takes care to enter there, and fill it with &s;uch furniture, as &s;oon era&s;es the &s;light impre&s;&s;ions it may have received by hearing the word of God.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd kind of hearers, de&s;cribed in the parable of the &s;ower, are tho&s;e who receive the word with a greater degree of attention, and in whom it produces an out|ward reformation of conduct and behaviour; but, not being impre&s;&s;ed on the mind by the operation of the Divine Spirit, it does not effect a real change of heart. Such per|&s;ons, while things go on &s;mooth, and they meet with &s;ucce&s;s and encouragement in the world, may make a profe&s;&s;ion, and appear to others, and think them&s;elves religious, but, like &s;eed &s;own on hard, &s;tony ground, which, though it &s;prings up, and looks green for a while, yet, when the &s;un &s;hines hot and bright, &s;oon withers for want of root; they cannot &s;tand in the day of adver&s;ity and trouble: <HI>for when tribulation, or per&s;ecution ari&s;eth becau&s;e of the word, by and by they are offended.</HI></P>
<P>THE third kind of hearers, are tho&s;e who &s;eem to receive the word of God with great earne&s;tne&s;s and attention; but however they may be delighted with it in the hou&s;e of God, they do not carry a favor of it into the world. In &s;ome, the toil, trouble, care, and vexation ari&s;ing from their circum&s;tances in the world, &s;o fill the mind, engage the attention, overwhelm the &s;pirit, and oppre&s;s the heart, that, like a plant incumbred and &s;urrounded with rank, poi&s;onous weeds, the word of God, which they have heard,
<PB N="85" REF="029927_0088_0FE3367D676AAED8">
cannot grow; the noble truths of the go&s;pel cannot have their proper influence on the mind, but gradually &s;ink and decline, till at la&s;t they are di&s;believed, or totally forgot|ten. Others, who meet with their de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s in their worldly cares, are &s;o a&s;&s;iduous in the pur&s;uit, and &s;o entirely devoted to the acqui&s;ition of wealth, that every thing to them &s;eems little and low which does not produce &s;ome temporal advantage: as riches increa&s;e, they &s;et their hearts upon them, and a worldly &s;pirit <HI>chokes the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</HI></P>
<P>IN oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e unprofitable hearers of the word, a fourth &s;ort are repre&s;ented in this parable, who&s;e hearts, by the Holy Spirit, are prepared for the reception of divine truth; for, as the be&s;t of ground, except it be ploughed, harrowed and clean&s;ed by the hu&s;bandman, will not receive the &s;eed, nor produce a plentiful harve&s;t; &s;o the heart of man, except it be changed by divine power, will not receive the word of God, nor pro|duce &s;uch fruit as the go&s;pel requires: but, when the heavenly &s;eed falls on tho&s;e hearts which have been wrought upon and prepared by the Divine Spirit, the word is received with gladne&s;s, it takes deep root in the mind, it operates on all the powers and faculties of the &s;oul, it terminates in obedience to the precepts of the go&s;pel, and brings forth fruit to the honour and intere&s;t of the cau&s;e of CHRIST, in proportion to the capacities and cir|cum&s;tances of the different &s;ubjects on which it falls, <HI>in &s;ome an hundred fold, in &s;ome &s;ixty, and in &s;ome thirty.</HI></P>
<P>OUR great Redeemer, having fini&s;hed his explanation of the parable of the &s;ower, he turned to his di&s;ciples, and explained to them, by the &s;imilitude of a lighted candle, the u&s;e they were to make of the knowledge which they would acquire by conver&s;ing with him, and receiving his divine in&s;tructions. <HI>Is a candle,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>brought to be put under a bu&s;hel, or under a bed, and not to be &s;et on a candle&s;tick? For there is nothing hid which &s;hall not be manife&s;ted, neither was any thing kept &s;ecret, but it &s;hould come abroad.</HI> By which the divine In&s;tructor gave them to under&s;tand, that, though now the&s;e heavenly truths were veiled in &s;hades and figures, and taught to mankind in parables, the time would come, that they would be more clearly revealed, and as a lighted candle, exalted on high, illuminates the whole apartment where it is placed, &s;o &s;hall the brightne&s;s of divine truth, by their preach|ing, be &s;pread abroad, and enlighten the dark nations of the earth: therefore, as the di&s;ciples of CHRIST were intended to convey the precepts of heavenly in&s;truction to the dark, uninlightened nations of the world, our Lord reminded them, that it was a mat|ter of the highe&s;t importance, that they &s;hould be rightly and fully taught tho&s;e truths they were to bear to the remote&s;t nations; and, therefore, it behoved them to hear him with the utmo&s;t care and attention. <HI>Take heed,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>what ye hear; with what mea&s;ure ye mete, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you; and unto you that hear &s;hall more be given.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER our Lord had been thus di&s;cour&s;ing to his di&s;ciples, he turned to the multitude on the &s;hore, and, addre&s;&s;ing them in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and powerful manner, he delivered to them the parable of the enemy's &s;owing tares among&s;t the wheat. <HI>The kingdom of heaven,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is likened to a man which &s;owed good &s;eed in his field: but while men &s;lept, his enemy came and &s;owed tares amongst the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was &s;prung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares al&s;o. So the &s;ervants of the hu&s;band|man came and &s;aid unto him, Sir did&s;t not thou &s;ow good &s;eed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He &s;aid unto them, an enemy hath done this. The &s;ervants &s;aid unto him, Wilt thou then, that we go and gather them up? But he &s;aid, Nay; le&s;t, while ye gather up the tares, ye root up al&s;o the wheat with them. Let both go together until the harve&s;t: and in the time of harve&s;t, I will &s;ay unto the reapers, Gather ye the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="029927_0089_0FE30EAA0D7753A0">THIS parable, as our Lord afterwards explained it to his di&s;ciples, relates to the dif|ferent &s;tates of men at the end of the world. The hu&s;bandman is our great Redeemer him&s;elf; the field is the chri&s;tian church, planted in various parts of the world; tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who are enabled by the Holy Spirit to love the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and bring fruit worthy their high profe&s;&s;ion, are the wheat; and tho&s;e who make an empty profe&s;&s;ion, without knowing the power of true religion, are the tares. The&s;e are &s;educed into the paths of wickedne&s;s by the enemy of God and man; and the parable elegantly repre&s;ents, the mixed &s;tate of the profe&s;&s;ing church on earth, and the deplorable end of the hypocrite and tho&s;e who know not God. Such characters as the&s;e may mix with the real Chri&s;tians, and may deceive for a time, by a&s;&s;uming the appearance of &s;uperior &s;anctity and &s;trictne&s;s of life; yet they will not fail &s;ooner or later, to betray them&s;elves, and make it manife&s;t that they are but tares among&s;t the wheat. Yet we are taught by this parable, how &s;in|cerely &s;oever we may wi&s;h to free the church from all corruption both in doctrine and practice, it is not lawful for us to a&s;&s;ume the prerogative of the great Judge of heaven and earth, by per&s;ecuting, or following with any corporal puni&s;hment, any who we apprehend to be hypocrites and corrupters of ture religion. The tares and the wheat are to grow toge|ther till harve&s;t, they are not to be &s;eparated, le&s;t by mi&s;taking the character of the per&s;ons, we be&s;tow the cen&s;ure on the true Chri&s;tian, which belongs to the hypocrite: but the harve&s;t will come when they will be &s;eparated by our great Redeemer him&s;elf, and his attending angels: then the tares will be bound up in bundles and burnt, but the wheat carefully gathered into the barn. For at the end of the world, our great Redeemer will di&s;tingui&s;h between the pretended and the real Chri&s;tian; the wicked will be condemned to eternal torment, but the righteous will be received to life eternal; when they <HI>&s;hall &s;hine forth, as the &s;un, in the kingdom of their Father.</HI></P>
<P>THE next parable which our exalted Redeemer though fit to propo&s;e to the li&s;tening mul|titudes, was that of the &s;eed which &s;prang up and grew imperceptibly. <HI>So is the kingdom of God,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>as if a man &s;hould ca&s;t &s;eed into the ground, and &s;hould &s;leep, and ri&s;e night and day, and the &s;eed &s;hould &s;pring and grow up he knoweth not how. For the earth bringeth forth fruit of it&s;elf; fir&s;t the blade, and then the ear. But when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the fickle, becau&s;e the harve&s;t is come.</HI> This beautiful picture repre&s;ents the gradual and &s;ilent progre&s;s of the go&s;pel in the heart of man; as the hu&s;bandman does not by any power of his own, cau&s;e the &s;eed to grow when he has &s;own it, but the blade and fruit are produced by the power of the great Creator, and by tho&s;e laws of nature which he he hath e&s;tabli&s;hed in the vegetable creation: &s;o the &s;eed of divine truth does not thrive in the heart of man by the power of the preacher, but by the &s;ilent and efficacious energy of the Spirit of God. Thus JESUS and his apo&s;tles, having preached the go&s;pel in the world, and taught the doctrines of true religion, they gave no commi&s;&s;ion to any to u&s;e the terrors of fire and &s;word to propagate them, but left it to the &s;ilent and &s;ecret influence of the Holy Spirit. And it is very probable that the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS &s;poke this parable to convince the Jews of their mi&s;take, in &s;uppo&s;ing that their Me&s;&s;iah would &s;et up a temporal king|dom, and advance his dominion by the means which are u&s;ed in the world to ri&s;e to &s;overeign greatne&s;s: and al&s;o it might be intended to quiet the minds of his di&s;ciples, and prevent them from being di&s;couraged when they &s;aw that an immediate and rapid &s;ucce&s;s did not attend their labours in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>THE next parable which JESUS &s;pake to the multitude was that of the grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed, which in Pale&s;tine and other parts of the Ea&s;t, ri&s;es from a &s;mall &s;eed to a large &s;preading tree. <HI>The kingdom of heaven,</HI> &s;aid the divine In&s;tructor, <HI>is like to a grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed, which a man took and &s;owed in his field; which indeed is the lea&s;t of all &s;eeds: but when it is grown, it is the greate&s;t among herbs, and becometh a tree, &s;o that the birds of the air come
<PB N="87" REF="029927_0090_0FE3368CBB775F98">
and lodge in the branches thereof.</HI> This may be con&s;idered as a continuation of the &s;ubject of the former parable; for though the go&s;pel &s;eed may at fir&s;t &s;eem &s;mall and contempti|ble, ari&s;ing from the crucifixion of its divine author, the inveterate hatred and final unbelief of the Jews, the mortifying nature of its precepts, the weakne&s;s of the per&s;ons employed to propagate its divine truths, and the &s;mall number and meanne&s;s of tho&s;e who fir&s;t received it; yet being founded on eternal truth, and &s;upported by divine power, it would increa&s;e to a &s;urpri&s;ing extent and greatne&s;s, filling the whole world, and afford|ing divine in&s;truction and comfort to per&s;ons of all nations, who &s;hould enjoy the high privileges of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, while the Jews, for their wickedne&s;s in oppo&s;ing the truth, &s;hould be left in unbelief, cut off from being a nation, and &s;cattered like chaff over the face of the earth.</P>
<P>OUR great Redeemer then concluded his di&s;cour&s;e with another parable of nearly the &s;ame import with the foregoing. <HI>The kingdom of heaven,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three mea&s;ures of meal, till the whole is leavened:</HI> alluding to the &s;ilent and effectual &s;preading of the go&s;pel, by the powerful influence of the Holy Spirit, and prevailing efficacy of divine truth.</P>
<P>WHILE our Lord was employed in delivering the&s;e elegant and beautiful di&s;cour&s;es, his mother and brethren came a &s;econd time, de&s;iring an interview with him: perhaps they were unwilling that he &s;hould weary him&s;elf with the continual fatigue of preaching, and did not approve of his making him&s;elf &s;o public, and appearing in &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a character among&s;t &s;uch va&s;t multitudes of people: and as it hereafter will appear in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory, that his brethren did not believe in him, it is very likely they de&s;igned to take him home with them, and per&s;uade him to attend to &s;ecular affairs. But our exalted Redeemer was not to be diverted from following his Father's work, and performing the great duties of his mi&s;&s;ion. On the&s;e grounds he appears to have de|clined the de&s;ired interview, with this an&s;wer, <HI>My mother and my brethren are tho&s;e who bear the word of God, and do it.</HI></P>
<P>EVENING now approaching, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the multitude, and retired with his di&s;ciples to an hou&s;e in Capernaum; where, at their de&s;ire, he explained to them the parable of the tares of the field in the manner before related; and then he pro|ceeded to deliver to them the parable of the trea&s;ure hid in the field, and the parable of the pearl of great price. The fir&s;t of the&s;e parables holds forth the abundant glory, excellency, and value of the go&s;pel, above all earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and the la&s;t denotes the willingne&s;s of all tho&s;e who are made acquainted with the high excellency and abun|dant worth of the go&s;pel, to part with their all in this world to obtain it. But, that the di&s;ciples might be informed that a mixed multitude of people would make a profe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel, and the hypocrites would be blended with the Chri&s;tians in &s;uch a man|ner as it would be difficult to &s;eparate them, he compared the go&s;pel church to a net, which enclo&s;ed every &s;ort of fi&s;h, good and bad, but were carefully &s;eparated when they were drawn to land; the good were pre&s;erved, and the bad thrown away: alluding to the great day of univer&s;al and eternal deci&s;ion and &s;eparation, when the righteous will be received into life eternal, and the wicked ca&s;t into hell.</P>
<P>OUR Lord having fini&s;hed the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, he a&s;ked his di&s;ciples if they under&s;tood them, they an&s;wered in the affirmative; and our great Redeemer added that every teacher of the go&s;pel ought to re&s;emble a per&s;on who&s;e hou&s;e was completely furni&s;hed, and bringeth <HI>forth out of his trea&s;ures things new and old.</HI></P>
<P>NOT long after this, our great Redeemer left Capernaum, and repaired to Nazareth, the city where he had &s;pent his younger years, and where he had dwelt with his relations
<PB N="88" REF="029927_0091_0FE3368F0C61D0A8">
till he entered on his public mini&s;try, and preached, among&s;t his old friends and coun|trymen, the glad-tidings of the kingdom. But they, though a&s;toni&s;hed at his doctrine, could not overcome the prejudices they had formerly conceived again&s;t him, on account of the meanne&s;s of his family, and therefore would not own him to be the Me&s;&s;iah; they could not overcome the &s;trong national prejudice they had conceived again&s;t their pro|mi&s;ed deliverer's appearing in a low, mean condition in the world; nor could they give up their ideas of the glory and grandeur of the Me&s;&s;iah's appearance, &s;o far as to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible that JESUS &s;hould be the man. Our Lord, therefore, finding them in the &s;ame temper of mind as when he formerly vi&s;ited them, did not choo&s;e to &s;tay long among&s;t them, but departed and taught in the neighbouring villages.</P>
<P>DURING our Saviour's &s;tay at Nazareth, he &s;ent out his di&s;ciples to preach in different parts of Galilee, and proclaim the glad-tidings that God was going to e&s;tabli&s;h the glo|rious kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah, in which he would be wor&s;hipped in &s;pirit and truth; and that they might confirm the doctrines they taught, and convince the whole nation that they received their commi&s;&s;ion from the Son of God, they were endowed with the power of working miracles. The evangeli&s;ts have not informed us how long they con|tinued their preaching; but it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that they &s;pent a con&s;iderable time in carrying on their work in &s;everal parts of the country.</P>
<P>THE people perceiving &s;uch wonderful works performed by the di&s;ciples of CHRIST, were exceedingly amazed, and their expectations were rai&s;ed very high; for they could not recollect that the old prophets had ever given to their &s;ervants the power of working miracles, and of con&s;equence, they concluded that JESUS mu&s;t be greater than any of them. This extraordinary circum&s;tance rai&s;ed the attention of the nation, and &s;pread his fame &s;o effectually about the country, that it reached the ears of Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee. This prince having lately, in an unju&s;t and cruel manner, taken away the life of John the Bapti&s;t, he heard of the mighty works performed by CHRIST, and his di&s;ciples, with the utmo&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s and concern. His attendants endeavoured to di&s;&s;ipate his fears, by telling him that one of the old prophets was ri&s;en from the dead; but a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his guilt would not permit him to re&s;t; for he apprehended, that the illu&s;trious per&s;on he had &s;o ba&s;ely murdered, was ri&s;en from the dead, and would doubtle&s;s be revenged on his murderer. He &s;aid unto his &s;ervants, <HI>This is John the Bapti&s;t; he is ri&s;en from the dead, and therefore mighty works do &s;hew forth them&s;elves in him.</HI></P>
<P>IT has been before related, on what occa&s;ion, and in what manner the Bapti&s;t was put to death; and the news of this mournful event having reached the di&s;ciples of CHRIST, while they were preaching in Galilee, tho&s;e of them who had formerly been the di&s;ciples of John, went and paid their la&s;t re&s;pects to the remains of their ma&s;ter, whom having decently interred, they carried the tidings to JESUS. When our great Redeemer had heard of the death of his relation and forerunner, he found him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed for retire|ment, and &s;ought the &s;ilent &s;hades of the de&s;ert of Beth&s;aida: he departed as private as po&s;&s;ible, that he might not be incommoded by the multitude, and for the greater &s;ecrecy he went by &s;ea. But every precaution was in&s;ufficient to &s;creen him from the penetrating eyes of the multitude who followed him; and his departure was not long concealed, for great numbers repaired to the de&s;ert, and found out the place of his retreat. The miracles which he performed, the benefit which the helple&s;s and mi&s;erable, always found from his goodne&s;s, and the &s;train of divine eloquence which flowed from his lips, had &s;uch an effect on the hone&s;t, open-hearted part of the nation, that the multitudes who had &s;een the won|ders he performed, and heard his heavenly voice, thought no difficulties too great to &s;ur|mount, no hard&s;hips too great to endure, nor no place too retired for them to penetrate, in order to attend on his mini&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="029927_0092_0FE336908FB94C90">THE kind and compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour of &s;inners, &s;eeing the multitude had found out his place of retreat, and beholding them crowding about him, he viewed them with tenderne&s;s and love, becau&s;e they were as &s;heep having no &s;hepherd; for, having none to in&s;truct them in tho&s;e things which concerned their everla&s;ting peace, they wandered about with|out a guide, without a defender. Their &s;ituation indeed, was like that of a large flock of &s;heep wandering upon the mountains, without a &s;hepherd to feed and defend them from the ravenous jaws of the various bea&s;ts of prey which waited to devour them. The ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, therefore, <HI>that good Shepherd, who came to lay down his life for the &s;heep,</HI> beheld them with compa&s;&s;ion: that &s;ame pity which brought him down from the throne of glory in heaven, for the &s;ake of his lo&s;t and wandering &s;heep, now brought him to this multitude of people: his heavenly goodne&s;s healed all the &s;ick among&s;t them, and from his lips they heard the words of eternal life.</P>
<P>THE divine In&s;tructor continued his heavenly di&s;cour&s;es, and attended to the great work of healing the di&s;ea&s;ed, not di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the people, though the day wore away, and the &s;hades of the evening were approaching. His di&s;ciples, thinking this circum&s;tance had e&s;caped his notice, thought proper to remind him, that the day was far advanced, and the place a &s;olitary de&s;ert, where neither food nor lodging could be procured: it would, therefore, be convenient to di&s;mi&s;s the people, that they might repair to the towns or villages on the borders of the wilderne&s;s, and provide them&s;elves food and other accom|modations; for they had nothing to eat. But our Lord informed them, that he did not intend to di&s;mi&s;s the &s;urrounding multitude &s;o ha&s;tily, for, as they were weary and faint in the wilderne&s;s, it was his intention to give them a repa&s;t; at the &s;ame time, to try what opinion his di&s;ciples entertained of his power, he turned to Philip, who was well acquainted with the country, and inquired, <HI>Whence &s;hall we buy bread, that the&s;e may eat?</HI> Philip, a&s;toni&s;hed at the propo&s;al, con&s;idering the va&s;tne&s;s of the multitude, and the en|ormous quantity of provi&s;ions which would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply them, he apprehended it impo&s;&s;ible to procure them in the de&s;ert; and not con&s;idering his Ma&s;ter's power to &s;upply them by extraordinary means, he replied, <HI>Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not &s;ufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</HI> Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord might ju&s;tly on this, as on a future occa&s;ion, have replied, <HI>Have I been &s;o long time with you, and ha&s;t thou not known me, Philip!</HI> But he did not reproach his di&s;ciples with their inattention to his former character and conduct, but commanded them to give the multitude to eat. The di&s;ciples, not yet under&s;tanding the de&s;ign of their ma&s;ter, repeated the objection of Philip, and propo&s;ed to go and buy a quantity of provi&s;ions&punc; but this was not their Lord's intention, who, without making them a direct an&s;wer, a&s;ked them how many loves they had. It does not appear that they had any bread in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; for after the di&s;ciples had made a diligent inquiry, Andrew came and informed his Ma&s;ter, that there was a lad among&s;t the multitude, that had five barley loaves, and two &s;mall fi&s;hes, a quantity &s;o incon&s;iderable, that they were a&s;hamed to mention it: <HI>What are they,</HI> &s;aid the di&s;ciples, <HI>amongst &s;o many?</HI> And what, indeed, would they have been among &s;uch multitudes of people, if they had not been di&s;tributed by the all-creating hand of the Son of God.</P>
<P>JESUS, notwith&s;tanding the &s;mallne&s;s of the number of loaves, and &s;cantine&s;s of the provi&s;ion, ordered them to be brought to him; and at the &s;ame time commanded the multitude to &s;it down on the gra&s;s, and ordered his di&s;ciples to arrange them in com|panies at convenient di&s;tances, that their number might be a&s;certained, and that they might be regularly &s;erved. In obedience to his command, the people &s;at down as they were ordered, no doubt wondering what would be the con&s;equence of &s;uch an ar|rangement, and what benevolent action our great Redeemer was about to perform.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="029927_0093_0FE3369BC3AB6078">THE multitude thus &s;eated in order, our Lord, in open view, took the five loaves and two &s;mall fi&s;hes in his hands, and the whole multitude had an opportunity of beholding what a &s;mall quantity of provi&s;ions, in the hands of the Creator of all things, were &s;ufficient to provide a repa&s;t for &s;uch a number of per&s;ons as were then a&s;&s;embled. The great ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t then looked up to heaven, and returned thanks to his heavenly Father, for his all-pre&s;erving and all-&s;upporting goodne&s;s, manife&s;ted at all times to his creatures, but particularly for his paternal care, in providing for their pre&s;ent refre&s;h|ment; he prai&s;ed his Almighty Father, for the miracles which he had been enabled to perform for the benefit of mankind, and particularly for that which he was now going to perform, for the refre&s;hment of the multitude, who had left their habitations with de&s;ires to &s;ee his mighty works, and hear his words, and followed him into the de&s;ert, where they were weary and faint for want of provi&s;ions. After which, our great Redeemer ble&s;&s;ed the bread, and his divine ble&s;&s;ing had &s;o wonderful an effect, that the five &s;mall barley loaves and two dry fi&s;hes, were multiplied to a quantity &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the craving appetites of ten thou&s;and per&s;ons; for the men were five thou&s;and, and it is very probable the women and children might not be le&s;s. The great Ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t di&s;tributed to his di&s;ciples, and they &s;erved the multitude as they &s;at on the gra&s;s; and &s;o plentiful were the provi&s;ions, that every one was &s;atisfied, and &s;uch fullne&s;s crowned our great Redeemer's board, that, when all the people had eat and were &s;atis|fied, there were twelve ba&s;kets filled with the broken meat.</P>
<P>THUS, the great Son of God, provided a fea&s;t in the de&s;ert, for the people who followed him; and though they had no canopy but the azure &s;ky, no table but the verdant gra&s;s, no better fare than barley-bread and dried fi&s;h, and no drink but the clear &s;pring; yet they were more honoured by the pre&s;ence of the illu&s;trious founder of the fea&s;t, than ever was a royal banquet, which was given by the A&s;&s;yrian or Per&s;ian kings; and doubtle&s;s there was more heart-felt joy, and &s;olid &s;atisfaction at this fea&s;t, than ever was at the noble banquet of the gorgeous Aha&s;uerus, or the &s;plendid enter|tainments of the imperious Bel&s;hazzar.</P>
<P>HAVE we not rea&s;on to wonder at the ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s of the heads of the Jewi&s;h nation, that &s;uch a manife&s;t di&s;play of divine power would not convince them. The account of this miracle, as recorded by the &s;everal evangeli&s;ts, is very plain and circum&s;tantial; and, it may be ob&s;erved, that the particular circum&s;tances of time and place, tended to make it more wonderful, more con&s;picuous, and le&s;s, liable to objections and cavils. The place was a de&s;ert, where no bread could be procured, and therefore, it is manife&s;t, beyond contradiction, that it mu&s;t be produced by a miracle. Had this repa&s;t been given to the &s;urrounding multitude, at one of the towns or villages, it might have been objected, that bread had been &s;ecretly &s;upplied: but neither the Phari|&s;ees of tho&s;e days, nor the infidels of ours, can tell us, how it was po&s;&s;ible for any deception of that kind to be practi&s;ed in the de&s;ert. And it may be further ob&s;erved, that this mighty work was performed in the evening, when the people had been fa&s;t|ing all day, and, with the fatigue of travelling were, doubtle&s;s weary and very hungry. Had this repa&s;t been given in the morning, the miracle might have been depreciated, by &s;uppo&s;ing, that the people did not &s;tand in need of refre&s;hment, and this treat might have been repre&s;ented as unnece&s;&s;ary: but the particular circum&s;tances attending this wonderful work, cut off every &s;hadow of an objection, and abundantly proved, that <HI>God can furni&s;h a table in the wilderne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>THE con&s;ideration of the wonderful power of the Son of God, thus manife&s;ted in procuring bread in the wilderne&s;s for &s;o many thou&s;ands of people, ought to relieve the
<PB N="91" REF="029927_0094_0FE3369E0F4E9058">
cares, and quiet the minds of his people concerning their daily bread. With what joy and &s;atisfaction of &s;oul ought we to con&s;ider, that we are under the immediate care of our heavenly Father, who&s;e paternal goodne&s;s provides &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for all his creatures; and, <HI>who openeth his hand, and &s;atisfieth the de&s;ire of every living thing.</HI> It is the beloved Son of the eternal Father, that &s;howers down &s;uch a wide profu&s;ion of ble&s;&s;ings on a thankle&s;s world; and according to the beautiful language of the P&s;al|mi&s;t, "vi&s;iteth the earth and ble&s;&s;eth it; who maketh it very plenteous, who watereth her furrows, and &s;endeth rain into the little vallies thereof; who maketh it &s;oft with &s;howers, and ble&s;&s;eth the increa&s;e thereof; who crowneth the year with his good|ne&s;s, while his clouds drop fatne&s;s, making the vallies &s;tand &s;o thick with corn, that they laugh and &s;ing." With what thankfulne&s;s and prai&s;e ought we to behold the con&s;tant effects of that heavenly goodne&s;s, which &s;upplies the whole creation with food: ought we not to rely on the paternal care of the great Parent of nature, who manife&s;ts his goodne&s;s, and di&s;plays his bounty to an unde&s;erving world, by <HI>giving them rain and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, and filling their hearts with food and gladne&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>NOR &s;hould we be unmindful of the manife&s;t exertion of divine power, in the con|&s;tant &s;upplies which are provided for a world of creatures, and in the abundant provi|&s;ion which is made for the daily &s;upply of all mankind. Is it any le&s;s a miracle, that the &s;upreme Lord of univer&s;al nature, &s;hould, every day, &s;upport and feed the whole race of mankind, and all the brute creation, than that he &s;hould feed ten thou&s;and per&s;ons in the wilderne&s;s, with five loaves and two &s;mall fi&s;hes? What proportion does ten thou&s;and per&s;ons bear to all the myriads of men on the face of the earth, who are daily feed by its fruits? And is not the increa&s;e of tho&s;e fruits as great a miracle, and as manife&s;t an exertion of divine power, as the increa&s;e of the bread by the ble&s;&s;ing of our great Redeemer.</P>
<P>IF we had hearts to con&s;ider the works of God with attention and care, we &s;hould perceive the manife&s;t exertions of his power, in the &s;ecret operations of Nature, and as clear proofs of his divinity in her regular productions, as in the mo&s;t extraordinary and miraculous events. The marks of divine power are equally &s;een in the wine, which ari&s;es from the moi&s;ture of the earth, through the tubes of vegetation, and is received from the branches of the vine; as in that in&s;tantaneou&s;ly made from water at the marriage at Cana. Nor ought they le&s;s to be regarded in the corn, gradually ri|pened, and made into bread for the &s;upport of all mankind; than in the bread mira|culou&s;ly ble&s;&s;ed to the &s;upport of the multitude in the wilderne&s;s: but we are very prone to overlook the common operations of creative wi&s;dom and power, without con|&s;idering, that, if we are unaffected with the divine munificence and bounty, &s;o mani|fe&s;tly and richly di&s;played in the works of nature and providence, there is much rea&s;on to conclude, that outward miracles would not awaken us to a &s;en&s;e of our duty, nor effectually mend our hearts: we are, however, very apt to deceive our&s;elves in this par|ticular, and often led to conclude, that had we been pre&s;ent at &s;o &s;tupendous a miracle, as that we are now con&s;idering, we &s;hould have adored the divine hand that wrought it, and never have for&s;aken the Lord of life. But, alas, if all the di&s;play of divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in the works of creation; if all the evidences of the omnipotence of the Son of God, in the con&s;tant &s;upplies which he provides for his numerous crea|tures; if the con&s;tant manife&s;tations of his goodne&s;s to our&s;elves, in providing for us, and feeding us the whole cour&s;e of our lives; will not elevate our hearts, and rai&s;e them to him&s;elf in gratitude and joy, there is the highe&s;t rea&s;on to conclude, that, had we &s;een the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS feed ten thou&s;and men, women, and children, with five loaves

and two fi&s;hes; yea, had we been partakers our&s;elves of this miraculous repa&s;t, we &s;hould have been like many, who really enjoyed the&s;e privileges, yet, afterwards took offence at &s;ome of his words, which they called hard &s;ayings, and <HI>walked no more with him.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Multitudes, after having been miraculou&s;ly fed in the Wilderne&s;s, attempt to take <HI>CHRIST</HI> by Force, and make him King: He &s;huns their Importunity by withdrawing him&s;elf from them: He walketh on the Sea to his Di&s;ciples: He &s;aves Peter, who de&s;ired to accompany him, but was &s;inking for want of Faith. <HI>CHRIST</HI> di&s;putes with the Jews in the Synagogue of Capernaum, and declareth him&s;elf to be the Bread of Life: He goes to Jeru&s;alum at the Pa&s;&s;over; then returns to Galilee, and reproves the Phari&s;ees for their Super&s;tition.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN the wondering multitudes had partook of the miraculous banquet, prepared for them by our great Redeemer, a &s;udden flow of gladne&s;s and elevation of mind ran through the de&s;ert; every eye was fixed on the great Founder of the fea&s;t; every heart was glad, and every tongue re&s;ounded his prai&s;e.</P>
<P>AND now, being thoroughly convinced, that he was their promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, and having no notion of the reign of the Me&s;&s;iah, but that of his &s;etting up a temporal kingdom, they reverenced him as the great deliverer of their nation, and &s;tood determined, immedi|ately to make him King, whether he con&s;ented to it or not. Loud acclamations re|&s;ounded through the woods and wilds, and the voice of exultation and triumph ran along the &s;ide of the mountain where the miracle had been performed: the di&s;ciples &s;eemed to join with the multitude in their de&s;ires, and every thing was preparing to proclaim him King.</P>
<P>JESUS, to prevent the execution of their de&s;ign, without their perceiving his intention, &s;ent his di&s;ciples away in a boat, with orders to &s;ail to Beth&s;aida. The multitude were very willing to let the di&s;ciples depart, when they &s;aw that JESUS did not go with them; perhaps, they imagined, that the di&s;ciples were &s;ent to provide &s;uch things as were nece&s;&s;ary again&s;t he a&s;&s;umed the kingdom; nor did they refu&s;e to di&s;per&s;e when our Lord di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, no doubt, de&s;igning to return in the morning; which, we find, was really the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;ent the di&s;ciples, and the multitude away, JESUS a&s;cended to the &s;ummit of the mountain alone, &s;pending the night in heavenly contemplation, and ardent prayers to his almighty Father.</P>
<P>BUT the di&s;ciples meeting with a contrary wind, could not continue their cour&s;e to Beth&s;aida, which lay about two leagues northward of the de&s;ert mountain, where the multitude had been miraculou&s;ly fed. They, however, did all in their power to land as near the city as po&s;&s;ible: but a tempe&s;t ari&s;ing they were to&s;&s;ed all night in the tumul|tuous &s;ea, without being able to make the de&s;ired port. At the conclu&s;ion of the fourth watch, which was about five o'clock in the morning, they were advanced no further than about a league from the &s;hore; they were to&s;&s;ed by the foaming waves, and oppo&s;ed in their cour&s;e by the &s;tormy wind; and, though they toiled hard, had no pro&s;pect of reaching the place where they de&s;ired to land.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="029927_0096_0FE336A11D6636F0">OUR Lord had, from the mountain, beheld the di&s;tre&s;s of his di&s;ciples, and was now coming to their relief, though they had not the lea&s;t expectation of his pre&s;ence. Thus the Chri&s;tian, when &s;torms and tempe&s;ts of trouble and affliction overtake him, is too prone to forget his almighty &s;upport, and overlook the promi&s;e of his great deliverer: but, it would be well for him to remember, that the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS beholds every particu|lar of his di&s;tre&s;s, and hath <HI>not forgotten to be gracious,</HI> but in his own time and way, will certainly appear in all his mightine&s;s to &s;ave and work out his deliverance. Nor ought it to be forgotten, that the time when human wi&s;dom fails, when our di&s;tre&s;&s;es and trouble ari&s;es to its highe&s;t pitch, when there appears no refuge, no help, no deliverer, then is the time for a God to manife&s;t his divine power; and, at &s;uch a time, he hath often been found to be nigh at hand, and hath brought deliverance to his people in the mo&s;t won|derful and unexpected manner.</P>
<P>THUS the di&s;ciples, when to&s;&s;ed by the mighty tempe&s;t, and in danger of being &s;wal|lowed up by the foaming &s;eas, &s;aw their divine ma&s;ter at a di&s;tance, walking upon the frothy &s;urface of the mighty waters; they &s;aw, but they knew him not: nor were they convinced by his nearer approach, but thinking they had &s;een an apparition, &s;hrieked with fear. Their terrors, however, were &s;oon at an end; with kind compa&s;&s;ion, and conde&s;cending goodne&s;s, in his well known voice, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS di&s;pelled their fears with the&s;e words, <HI>Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.</HI> No &s;ooner had our great Re|deemer uttered the&s;e words, than every fear vani&s;hed, and &s;atisfaction and joy filled every heart. Peter was &s;o elated with the &s;ight of his Ma&s;ter, and &s;o overjoyed to &s;ee him walking on the &s;ea, that he felt in his mind a &s;trong de&s;ire to accompany him; and, accordingly, begged his ma&s;ter to permit him to come upon the water.</P>
<P>OUR great Redeemer having, with conde&s;cending goodne&s;s, granted his reque&s;t, he left the boat, and walked on the &s;urface of the &s;ea; and &s;ome time continued the mira|culous cour&s;e, wondering at him&s;elf, and rejoicing in the power of his ma&s;ter. But the &s;torm increa&s;ed, the whi&s;tling winds roared around him, and the wild &s;urges to&s;&s;ed their raging heads on high, and da&s;hed about their foam; &s;o that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that he kept on his feet. Peter was not &s;o &s;trong as he imagined; his pre|&s;ence of mind for&s;ook him; his faith failed; he forgot the pre&s;ence of his divine ma&s;ter, and he began to &s;ink in the mighty waters. In this extremity, he looked earne&s;tly for his divine &s;upporter, and, upon the brink of being &s;wallowed up, he cried, <HI>Lord &s;ave me!</HI> His kind, compa&s;&s;ionate ma&s;ter, immediately relieved him; <HI>he &s;tretched out his hand and caught him;</HI> at the &s;ame time, gently rebuking his &s;taggering re&s;olution and wavering faith, he &s;aid unto him, <HI>O thou of little faith, wherefore did&s;t thou doubt?</HI></P>
<P>THE ca&s;e of Peter &s;hould be a &s;tanding warning to the Chri&s;tian, and excite him to be very cautious of putting a vain confidence in his own &s;trength. Peter thought that he could endure all things in the company of his ma&s;ter, and, while he felt his heart warm, he &s;uppo&s;ed that his re&s;olution and courage would bear him above every fear. But on this, as well as on a future occa&s;ion, which will hereafter be remarked, he found him&s;elf mi&s;taken. When he perceived the &s;torm to increa&s;e, and foaming billows rage more horribly than before, his fears &s;ugge&s;ted, that either his ma&s;ter would be unable or unwilling to &s;upport him amid&s;t the furious bla&s;ts of the tempe&s;t. He had, on various occa&s;ions, beheld the divine power and goodne&s;s of his ma&s;ter, and his fears were un|rea&s;onable, and he was ju&s;tly to be blamed; becau&s;e the &s;ame power which had before been &s;o fully manife&s;ted, and which now had enabled him to walk on the &s;ea, was able to &s;upport him there, notwith&s;tanding all the horrors of the &s;torm.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="029927_0097_0FE337F7B2E74BB8">PETER might have rea&s;oned thus, had he been in his right mind; but his fear pre|vailed, his courage and re&s;olution, which he depended &s;o much upon, for&s;ook him, and he began to &s;ink. Thus the Chri&s;tian, when he enjoys the pre&s;ence of his Saviour, thinks that he can <HI>endure all things;</HI> and concludes, that <HI>his mountain &s;tands &s;trong, and he &s;hall never be moved:</HI> but, when affliction and trouble ari&s;e, he has a very different view of things; when great dangers are before him, and the boi&s;terous waves of di&s;appoint|ment, vexation, and di&s;tre&s;s, roar around him, he is very prone to be di&s;heartened, and to think, that he &s;hall certainly be &s;wallowed up, that God hath for&s;aken him, and will be favourable no more. Such are too often his &s;entiments, and, if the divine hand of his Saviour did not hold him out, he would, like Peter, &s;ink in the mighty water.</P>
<P>THIS miracle of our exalted Redeemer's walking on the &s;ea, &s;eems to have a&s;toni&s;hed the di&s;ciples, more than any which had been before it; for though they had &s;o lately &s;een the miracle of feeding the multitude with five loaves, it did not appear to have &s;uch an effect on their minds, as this la&s;t manife&s;tation of his divine power; for now, with the utmo&s;t veneration, gratitude, and joy, they <HI>came and wor&s;hipped him, &s;aying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</HI></P>
<P>NOR was walking on the &s;ea, the only miracle which our Redeemer wrought at this time; for we are informed by the evangeli&s;ts, that as &s;oon as their almighty ma&s;ter, and his relieved di&s;ciple, were received into the &s;hip, the ve&s;&s;el was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly tran&s;|ported to its intended port. <HI>Then they willingly received him into the &s;hip; and imme|diately the &s;hip was at the land whither they went.</HI></P>
<P>IT was in the country adjacent to Capernaum, that our great Redeemer landed; and, as he had not been in that neighbourhood &s;ince his vi&s;iting Nazareth, the country people flocked about him in great numbers, bringing their &s;ick and di&s;ea&s;ed, which the divine phy&s;ician immediately healed: and, as it had been a con&s;iderable time &s;ince he had been in that country, they crowded around him in &s;uch numbers, that he could not pay a particular attention to every object of di&s;tre&s;s; but they had &s;o great an opinion of the healing virtue, which he &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that they be&s;eeched him, <HI>that they might only touch the hem of his garment; and as many as touched were made perfectly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></P>
<P>IT hath been before related, that after CHRIST had fed the multitude in the de&s;ert, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them; but, though they di&s;per&s;ed at his command, they did not return to their habitations: for, perceiving that the di&s;ciples were &s;ent to the other &s;ide of the lake, and that JESUS &s;tayed behind, they probably concluded, that they were &s;ent to provide nece&s;&s;aries for their ma&s;ter's a&s;&s;uming the kingdom; though he had mode&s;tly declined that high dignity in the evening, they were encouraged to hope, that he would accept of it the en&s;uing day. This expectation, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, induced them to lodge in the &s;olitary wilderne&s;s, and &s;helter them&s;elves in caverns of the rocks and moun|tains, though they were very much incommoded by the raging of the &s;torm.</P>
<P>WHEN morning arrived, the multitude left the places of their retreat, and &s;earched for our Redeemer in every part of the de&s;ert mountain: they &s;aw him a&s;cend to the &s;ummit the foregoing evening, and were very much &s;urpri&s;ed that he could not be found; but having wearied them&s;elves in an un&s;ucce&s;sful &s;earch, they probably concluded that he had departed in &s;ome boat which belonged to the &s;ea of Tiberius, that had been forced by the &s;torm to take &s;helter in &s;ome creek, at the foot of the mountain. With this expectation, they departed to Capernaum, where they found him in the Synagogue, teaching the people; and, with a mixture of joy and &s;urpri&s;e, a&s;ked him, <HI>Rabbi, when
<PB N="95" REF="029927_0098_0FE30EB293D915D0">
come&s;t thou hither?</HI> To this que&s;tion, our great Redeemer an&s;wered, that they did not follow him becau&s;e they were convinced by his miracles of the truth of his divinity, but becau&s;e they had been miraculou&s;ly fed: <HI>Verily, verily I &s;ay unto you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>ye &s;eek me, not becau&s;e ye &s;aw the miracles, but becau&s;e ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</HI> Hereby our great Redeemer intimated, that their views in following him were low, &s;elfi&s;h, and &s;ordid, and far below what might be expected from the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom. Food for the body is of &s;mall con&s;equence, when compared with tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which promote the welfare of the immortal &s;oul. It was not mere animal food which the Son of God came down from heaven to be&s;tow, but that divine wi&s;dom and grace which would lead the immortal mind in the paths of eternal happine&s;s; and, therefore, he exhorted them not to follow him for common food, but for that meat which endureth to everla&s;ting life. <HI>Labour not,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>for the meat which peri&s;heth, but for that meat which endureth unto everla&s;ting life, which the &s;on of man &s;hall give unto you: for him hath God the Father &s;ealed.</HI></P>
<P>THE Jews, if they had attentively con&s;idered the writings of their prophets, where divine wi&s;dom and knowledge are frequently held forth, under the metaphors of meat and drink, might ea&s;ily have under&s;tood what our Saviour meant by <HI>the meat which endureth unto everla&s;ting life.</HI> But their popular notions of a temporal dominion, led them into the idea of &s;ome corporeal food, which the Me&s;&s;iah would give them to enable them to pur&s;ue the de&s;igns, and e&s;tabli&s;h the glories of his kingdom. It is, therefore, no won|der that they a&s;ked him, what they &s;hould do to erect the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, and obtain that wonderful bread, which, he &s;aid, God had commi&s;&s;ioned him to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>THE minds of the Jews were filled with va&s;t conceptions of the &s;plendour and glory of the Me&s;&s;iah's reign; as they expected that CHRIST was about to e&s;tabli&s;h his great empire, doubtle&s;s they imagined he would have given proper directions for their ri&s;ing again&s;t, and oppo&s;ing the Roman power, as the fir&s;t &s;tep towards rai&s;ing that dominion which had been &s;o long promi&s;ed to their nation. But our great Redeemer, to convince them of their mi&s;take, and inform them what God really required of them, in order to erect the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, told them, that the way to obtain favour of the God of I&s;rael, was to believe in the per&s;on whom he had &s;ent. The Jews were exceedingly offended at this unexpected an&s;wer, and &s;eemed determined not to receive CHRIST as their Me&s;&s;iah, becau&s;e he declined all means of e&s;tabli&s;hing a temporal kingdom: as, therefore, he appeared in a character &s;o contrary to their expectations of the manife&s;tation of the Me&s;&s;iah, they required him to produce &s;ome &s;igns, which might demon&s;trate that he was greater than Mo&s;es, or any of the old prophets. As to the miracle of feeding the multitude, they &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;uch a pre-eminency could not be gathered from thence, becau&s;e Mo&s;es had fed their whole nation with manna in the wilderne&s;s, which, they in&s;inuated, was a greater miracle than CHRIST's feeding ten thou&s;and per&s;ons in the wilderne&s;s. <HI>What &s;ign &s;heweth thou then,</HI> &s;aid they unto him, <HI>that we may &s;ee, and believe thee? What do&s;t thou work? Our fathers did eat manna in the de&s;ert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</HI> To this objection, our Lord re|plied, <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, Mo&s;es gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</HI></P>
<P>THE manna which &s;u&s;tained the I&s;raelites in the wilderne&s;s, was not the production of Mo&s;es, but the gift of God; it was not &s;ent as an evidence of Mo&s;es, being a great prophet, but was intended to carry on the de&s;igns of divine providence, in the &s;upport of that peculiar people, and to be an emblem, or repre&s;entation of that true &s;piritual, heavenly bread, which God hath given for the &s;piritual life of all who believe in his Son.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="029927_0099_0FE336AB4E2C8270">SOME of the audience, who had li&s;tened with great plea&s;ure, to the de&s;cription which our Lord had given of the coele&s;tial bread, were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an care&s;t de&s;ire to be partakers of &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing: and immediately cried out, <HI>Lord, evermore give us this bread.</HI> To which, the divine In&s;tructor replied, <HI>I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me, &s;hall never hunger; and he that believeth on me, &s;hall never thir&s;t.</HI> But, continued our great Redeemer, as I have often &s;aid, your nation ob&s;tinately and re&s;olutely re&s;i&s;ts the light, and continues in unbelief, notwith&s;tanding the manife&s;t and glaring evidences of divine power, which you have &s;een, and the glorious fruits which would follow on your believing; but think not, that your unbelief will prevent the ri&s;ing glories of my &s;piritual kingdom; for many there are which my father hath given me, the&s;e &s;hall be induced by the power of his &s;pirit to come unto me, <HI>and him that cometh, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out: for I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that &s;ent me. And this is the Father's will which hath &s;ent, that, of all which he hath given me, I &s;hould lo&s;e no|thing, but &s;hould rai&s;e it up at the la&s;t day. And this is the will of him that &s;ent me, that every one which &s;eeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everla&s;ting life: and I will rai&s;e him up at the la&s;t day.</HI></P>
<P>AS the greate&s;t part of the Jews were de&s;irous only of temporal privileges and ad|vantages from the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, it is no wonder they &s;hould be offended at this doctrine; they could not bear the thought, that a man who declined all earthly honours, &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Me&s;&s;iah: nor could they tell what he meant by calling him&s;elf the bread of life, and a&s;&s;erting, that he came down from heaven. With mur|muring and di&s;content, therefore, they ha&s;tily exclaimed, <HI>Is not this Je&s;us, the &s;on of Jo&s;eph, who&s;e father and mother we know? How is it then that he &s;aith, I came down from heaven?</HI></P>
<P>TO the&s;e degrading expre&s;&s;ions, our Lord thought fit to reply, that no objections ari&s;ing from the meanne&s;s of his birth and education, could invalidate the te&s;timony of the miracles which he had wraught, or excu&s;e their ob&s;tinacy and unbelief. But it was not &s;trange, that they &s;hould oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t the truth, for it required the agency of divine power to teach them to under&s;tand what he meant by declaring him&s;elf the bread of life: and al&s;o it mu&s;t be the mighty power of God, which enabled them to receive him, and live upon him as &s;uch. A believing in the Son of God, as the only Saviour of &s;inners, and re&s;ting upon him for life and &s;alvation, and thereby partaking of the divine nature, and receiving &s;piritual nouri&s;hment from him, as the body does from corporeal bread, was not within the reach of the natural abilities of the unbelieving Jews, nor any of the human race, without divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, therefore, our Lord told them, <HI>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath &s;ent me, draw him.</HI> And he further proceeded to inform them, that it was related in their prophets, concerning the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah, that all the &s;ubjects of that kingdom &s;hould be taught of God, <HI>Every man, therefore, that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</HI> But, continued our great Redeemer, you are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that men will be &s;o favoured as to &s;ee God with their corporeal eyes; <HI>for him none hath &s;een, or can &s;ee:</HI> but the hap|pine&s;s and glory of that kingdom will con&s;i&s;t in believing on me, in &s;uch a manner as to receive me as the true bread of life: by this the believer will obtain a vital union with me, and draw &s;piritual nouri&s;hment from me; and, by that means, grow up to everla&s;ting life.</P>
<P>OUR Lord, having thus declared him&s;elf to be the bread of life, which came down from heaven, and &s;hewn the way in which it is to be obtained, proceeded to examine the compari&s;on between him&s;elf, con&s;idered as the bread from heaven, and the manna,
<PB N="97" REF="029927_0100_0FE336ACE5A45E28">
which, in the time of Mo&s;es, the I&s;raelites eat in the wilderne&s;s. <HI>Your fathers,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>did eat manna in the wilderne&s;s, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thereof, and not die.

<P>THOUGH the Jews were no &s;trangers to a figurative way of &s;peaking, yet &s;uch was their blindne&s;s and perver&s;ene&s;s, that they under&s;tood tho&s;e words, and the re&s;t of CHRIST's declaration, in a literal &s;en&s;e, and inquired, with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, <HI>How can this man give us his fle&s;h to eat&punc;</HI> But our Lord, knowing what manner of per&s;ons he was conver&s;ing with, did not think proper to explain his meaning in any other way of &s;peaking; but continuing in the &s;ame figurative way of expre&s;&s;ion, he repeated, and affirmed what he had before a&s;&s;erted, <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>except ye eat the fle&s;h of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Who&s;o eateth my fle&s;h, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will rai&s;e him up at the la&s;t day. For my fle&s;h is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed;</HI> meaning, that no per&s;on can obtain that eternal life, which the go&s;pel of CHRIST makes known, but by a vital faith, which receives the Son of God, and, partaking of his divine nature, draws &s;piritual nouri&s;hment and life from him. 'He that eateth my fle&s;h, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath &s;ent me, and I live by the Father; &s;o he that eateth me, even he &s;hall live by me.'</P>
<P>OUR Lord proceeded to inform them, that this is the bread which he had before told them came down from heaven, infinitely &s;uperior, in its nature and con&s;equences, to that bread which their fathers eat in the wilderne&s;s; 'for they eat the manna and are dead; but who&s;o eateth this bread &s;hall live for ever.'</P>
<P>SUCH was the conference which our Saviour had with the Jews, in the Synagogue at Capernaum, which took its ri&s;e from the miraculous repa&s;t which he had &s;o lately pro|vided for the multitude in the de&s;ert, and thence naturally turned on bread. Though the Jews were no &s;trangers to a figurative way of &s;peaking, and might have found the &s;ame mode of expre&s;&s;ion in their own prophets, yet they had no clear idea of his meaning, eating his fle&s;h, and drinking his blood, they &s;till under&s;tood literally; and, as it was a thing prohibited in the law of Mo&s;es, and abhorred by the mo&s;t barbarous nations, they looked upon it with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment and aver&s;ion; and many of his di&s;|ciples, with a mixture of di&s;&s;atisfaction and &s;urpri&s;e, &s;aid, <HI>This is a hard &s;aying; who can hear it?</HI> Our Lord, perceiving their di&s;content, &s;aid, Are ye offended becau&s;e I told you my fle&s;h was meat, and my blood was drink; what would you think if you &s;aw <HI>the Son of man a&s;cend up where he was before? It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the fle&s;h profiteth nothing: the words that I &s;peak unto you, they are &s;pirit, and they are life.</HI> Thus, our Lord further explained the meaning of what he had before advanced; as much as if he had &s;aid, When you &s;ee me a&s;cend with this body into heaven, you will be con|vinced that I really de&s;cended from thence; and you will al&s;o perceive that you cannot eat my fle&s;h, or drink my blood in a corporeal manner; I never intended you &s;hould think my words had any &s;uch meaning: my fle&s;h in &s;uch ca&s;e, could not be of any ad|vantage to the Sons of men; but the great ble&s;&s;ings I have been relating, ari&s;e from receiving the doctrines I preach; to reveal the&s;e, I laid a&s;ide the glory which I had with my Father; I took upon me the veil of fle&s;h, and a&s;&s;umed the nature of man: it is, therefore, entering into the &s;pirit of the&s;e doctrines, which will bring you to eternal

life; but I know your hearts are &s;o wicked, and your prejudices &s;o &s;trong, that you will not receive them; nor am I di&s;appointed in you; for, I have told you before, that <HI>no man can come unto me, except it be given him of the Father.</HI></P>
<P>THE Jews were &s;o puzzled, confounded and offended at this di&s;cour&s;e, that many who had profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves the di&s;ciples of CHRIST, departed out of the &s;ynagogue, and followed him no more. They did not under&s;tand his views, nor like his method of pro|ceeding; nor could they perceive how a temporal kingdom, that idol of Jewi&s;h vanity, was likely at this rate to be e&s;tabli&s;hed: and, therefore, they could no longer acknowledge JESUS to be the Me&s;&s;iah, who&s;e appearance and reign they expected &s;o va&s;tly different.</P>
<P>WHEN the Jews were departed, our Lord turned him&s;elf to his di&s;ciples, with benignity of countenance, and with an air of conde&s;cending goodne&s;s, bid them remark how de|grading and &s;hameful it was for the &s;ons of men, to con&s;ider, and reflect, on the perver&s;e|ne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy of the unbelieving Jews; who thought them&s;elves offended, and made it a crime, for a&s;&s;erting and &s;preading &s;uch divine, immutable truths, and knowledge, to which <HI>they deafened their ears,</HI> and which affected &s;o materially their future welfare and tranquility. Divine truths! demon&s;trated to them in &s;upernatural miracles, heavenly goodne&s;s, and by the fulfilments of the predictions of the ancient prophets, out of all probability of doubt, if they would only reflect and con&s;ider on the &s;acred writings, and how incon&s;i&s;tent it ought to appear to all, who were not blinded, nor led a&s;tray by evil-minded men, nor over fond of following implicitly, without con&s;idering the manife&s;t contradictions, and ab&s;urdities contained in the dogmas of their Elders; whom they them&s;elves de&s;pi&s;ed, by performing the lea&s;t, and neglecting the mo&s;t material rites which they contained.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer added, that by &s;uch an ungrateful conduct towards his hea|venly Father, they rendered them&s;elves unworthy to partake the ble&s;&s;ings ari&s;ing from his divine and &s;piritual kingdom, to which they turned their hearts, in defiance to the precepts and examples of the Son of Man; delighting in iniquity and walking in darkne&s;s; preferring the works of feeble men, to the paths of his heavenly kingdom, turning their hearts again&s;t his mini&s;try, by entertaining &s;uch notions of the Me&s;&s;iah's temporal kingdom, &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine will of his heavenly Father; but that the time will come, when, convinced of their iniquitous proceedings, they &s;hould atone for their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and the power of the Son of man will be fully known. Adding, al&s;o, that becau&s;e he permitted his di&s;ciples to eat with unwa&s;hen hands, which was con|trary to the tradition of the elders, by which the Phari&s;ees explained the law of Mo&s;es. Several in&s;tances of legal uncleanne&s;s were particularly &s;tated, and forbidden by the Jewi&s;h legi&s;lature; but the&s;e, and other cerimonial performances, were multiplied in the mo&s;t extravagant and ridiculous manner in tho&s;e traditions, which were held in &s;uch high veneration by the Phari&s;ees. The&s;e people, who valued them&s;elves on an exact and &s;crupulous performance of every title of the law, con&s;idered it as a notorious offence to eat bread with unwa&s;hen hands, though at the &s;ame time, they were &s;candalou&s;ly care|le&s;s in things of the highe&s;t importance.</P>
<P>TO &s;hew the &s;tupidity and folly of this conduct, our Lord an&s;wered the que&s;tion of the Phari&s;ees, by retorting on them the wickedne&s;s of their conduct in a &s;crupulous exactne&s;s and punctuality, in the ob&s;ervance of human traditions, and, at the &s;ame time, neglecting the po&s;itive commands of God. <HI>Why do you al&s;o,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>tran&s;gre&s;s the com|mandment of God by your tradition? For God commanded, &s;aying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that cur&s;eth father or mother, let him die the death. But ye &s;ay, Who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay

to his father or his mother, it is a gift, by what&s;oever thou mighte&s;t be profited by me:</HI> that is, whatever I might have &s;pared for the relief of my parents, I have dedicated to God, and thus &s;uffers his parents to want, <HI>not honouring his father and mother, he &s;hall be free.</HI> Thus have you, continued our great Redeemer, &s;et a&s;ide the immutable duties of natural religion, and dared to oppo&s;e and contradict the po&s;itive commandments of God, by your ridiculous and contemptible traditions: <HI>ye hypocrites,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>well did I&s;aias prophe&s;y of you, &s;aying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoreth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me: but in vain do they wor&s;hip me, preaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord having thus &s;harply rebuked the Phari&s;ees, he turned to the people and explained to them the nature of the argument, and de&s;ired them to reflect on the ab&s;ur|dity of the doctrine of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees. <HI>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but that which cometh out of the mouth, that defileth a man,</HI> &s;aid he; and ap|pealed to the common &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding of mankind, for the apparent truth of this ob&s;ervation, de&s;iring them to judge what contemptible hypocrites tho&s;e per&s;ons mu&s;t be, who could profe&s;&s;edly neglect the great duties of morality, which are of univer&s;al and eternal obligations, and at the &s;ame time, value them&s;elves on the exact and &s;crupu|lous performance of &s;uch a trifle as wa&s;hing of hands.</P>
<P>THE Phari&s;ees were highly offended at our Lord, becau&s;e he &s;pake in a degrading manner of their traditions, of which, having complained with &s;ome warmth, the di&s;|ciples came and informed their ma&s;ter. JESUS replied, that they need not give them|&s;elves any pain about the offence which that &s;et of men had taken at his words, nor need they be afraid of their anger; for both them&s;elves and their doctrine would &s;oon be de&s;troyed, for neither of them were of God. <HI>Every plant,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>which my heavenly Father hath not planted, &s;hall be rooted up. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, they &s;hall both fall into the ditch.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the di&s;ciples them&s;elves did not fully under&s;tand, nor were they entirely &s;atisfied with his doctrine; and Peter having de&s;ired his Lord to explain it to them, the divine in&s;tructor proceeded to inform them, that meats being of a corporeal nature, could not defile the &s;pirit of a man, or render him polluted in the &s;ight of God: no real guilt can be contracted this way, except the meats are u&s;ed to exce&s;s, or in direct contradiction to the command of God; and then the pollution proceeds from the man, who &s;uffers him&s;elf to be prevailed on to tran&s;gre&s;s a po&s;itive command, and not from the meat, which, as the good creature of God, is lawful to be received. Thus, that which entereth in at the mouth, doth not defile the man, but that which cometh out of the mouth, pro|ceeding from a wicked heart, &s;uch as <HI>evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, fal&s;e witne&s;s, bla&s;phemies: the&s;e are the things which defile a man; but to eat with unwa&s;hen hands, defileth not a man.</HI> Di&s;cour&s;es like the&s;e, could not fail of exceedingly offending the proud, &s;elf-conceited Phari&s;ees, and rai&s;ing their re&s;entment to its highe&s;t pitch: for the&s;e, and &s;uch like ob&s;ervations of our Lord, tended to &s;trip them of that out&s;ide &s;hew of &s;anctity and &s;uperior &s;trictne&s;s, with which they ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed their deformity, and ren|dered them&s;elves &s;o venerable in the e&s;teem of the vulgar Jews. The&s;e di&s;cour&s;es there|fore, and the general oppo&s;ition the proud Phari&s;ees met with from the Son of God, excited them, with the utmo&s;t pride and envy, not only to oppo&s;e his doctrine and degrade his miracles, but to attack his reputation, and plot again&s;t his life. Our great Redeemer thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to continue the conte&s;t with &s;uch hardened hypocrites, and determined oppo&s;ers of the truth, and immediately departed out of the country.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>JESUS,</HI> at the repeated Reque&s;t of the Wowan of Canaan, cures her daughter: Re&s;tores the Faculty of Speech to a dumb Man at Decapolis: Miraculou&s;ly feeds the Multitude a &s;econd Time in the De&s;ert: Warmly exhorts his Di&s;ciples to beware of the Leaven of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees: Re&s;tores Sight to a blind Man, near the City of Beth&s;aida: After which, he departs into the Towns of Cae&s;area-Philippi, where he approves and commends the Faith of Peter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Lord of life having departed from Galilee, to evade the cruel and malicious de&s;igns of the Phari&s;ees, he retired to the borders of Pale&s;tine, and approached near to tho&s;e two famous maritime cities Tyre and Sidon: but &s;o great was the veneration of the common people, &s;uch the fame he had acquired by his kind and beneficent actions, and &s;o many the benefits which multitudes had received from his all-healing goodne&s;s, it was not po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be concealed. And though he was &s;o famous in the land of I&s;arel.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t, among&s;t the inhabitants of the&s;e Heathen cities, which implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Son of God, was an unhappy parent, who&s;e only daughter had an unclean &s;pirit, and was <HI>grieveou&s;ly vexed with a devil.</HI> Various were the di&s;courage|ments which lay in the way of the afflicted matron; &s;he was a Canaanite, one of that dete&s;ted race with which the Jews would have no dealings, and with whom they di&s;dained to conver&s;e, and had every rea&s;on to fear, that her petition would be di&s;gu&s;t|ing to one of the mo&s;t eminent of the &s;ons of I&s;rael; but, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e circum&s;tances, &s;he, as an humble petitioner, threw her&s;elf upon the tender mercies of the benevolent Son of God: &s;trong nece&s;&s;ity urged her on, grief and growing di&s;tre&s;s cau&s;ed her to be importunate; &s;uch dreadful &s;orrow, &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing di&s;tre&s;s &s;urrounded her, it is no wonder that &s;he would take no denial, but pur&s;ued, with repeated petitions, the only per&s;on who was able to help. Accordingly, in the deepe&s;t humility of mind, with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the mo&s;t ardent, ear|ne&s;t, and powerful addre&s;s, &s;he came and fell at the feet of our great Redeemer; &s;he be&s;ought him, and cried, <HI>Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David.</HI> The earne&s;tne&s;s of this woman's petition, and her calling our Lord the <HI>Son of David,</HI> plainly indicate, that &s;he believed him to be the Me&s;&s;iah; &s;he &s;eems to have received that faith, which was always honoured by the Son of God, and always recommended the per&s;ons who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, to his fir&s;t regard; and one would have expected, that &s;uch a petition would not have been rejected by that bountiful and merciful Redeemer, who <HI>went about doing good,</HI> and who kindly invited the weary and heavy-laden, to come to him with the promi&s;e of relief.</P>
<P>THIS woman, being a native of Syrophoenicia, was, no doubt, educated in all the ido|latrous &s;uper&s;tition of the Greeks; but had been enabled to believe in the Son of God, and earne&s;tly and vehemently to apply to him for relief. And there is no rea&s;on to doubt, but that divine Per&s;on, who had enabled her to believe his ability to heal her daughter, and thus, with all her heart and &s;oul, to implore his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, beheld her with an eye of tender pity, and &s;tood determined to grant her reque&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT we find, that our Lord did not think proper to let her know his intentions towards her at fir&s;t. He made no reply to her petition, nor did he &s;eem to take the lea&s;t notice, either of her, or her di&s;tre&s;s; but this &s;ilence, and &s;eeming di&s;regard, did
<PB N="101" REF="029927_0104_0FE336BE9D560668">
not intimidate her &s;o far as to induce her to de&s;i&s;t; but excited her to pre&s;s her petition with the more earne&s;tne&s;s. She continued her cries with a vehemence which would take no denial, till the di&s;ciples were affected with her grief, and became her advocates; and they, however &s;trongly they had imbibed the prejudices of their nation, again&s;t the Gentiles&punc; be&s;ought their Ma&s;ter to di&s;mi&s;s this trouble&s;ome petitioner, to grant her re|que&s;t, and &s;end her away.</P>
<P>BUT JESUS &s;oon &s;ilenced his di&s;ciples, with an an&s;wer agreeable to their own preju|dices; <HI>I am not &s;ent,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>but to the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</HI> To this, the whole train readily a&s;&s;ented; they had an high opinion of the peculiar privileges and high prerogatives of the Jews, and looked upon the Gentiles as ab&s;olutely unclean, and unworthy of the lea&s;t favour from the God of I&s;rael: &s;o that they were entirely &s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, and urged the matter no further.</P>
<P>But the woman her&s;elf was not &s;o ea&s;ily prevailed on to give up her reque&s;t: it was her own cau&s;e; &s;he had no hopes of relief from any other quarter; and that divine power which had wrought faith in her heart, and given her a full per&s;ua&s;ion, that J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">SUS was the Me&s;&s;iah, and able to help her, had al&s;o given her &s;trength and per&s;eve|rance in her reque&s;t. She took &s;ome encouragement, from ob&s;erving her&s;elf the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation between CHRIST and his di&s;ciples, and, though con&s;cious of her unwor|thine&s;s to approach &s;o illu&s;trious a per&s;on, yet fully convinced of his divinity, &s;he wor|&s;hipped him, and prayed, <HI>Lord, help me.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord now conde&s;cended to &s;peak to this humble and earne&s;t petitioner: but his words were &s;eemingly &s;ufficient to have di&s;couraged every future attempt; and though &s;he had conceived &s;o high an opinion of the per&s;on and conde&s;cending goodne&s;s of our Lord, his reply &s;eems &s;ufficient to have in&s;pired her with bitter di&s;like and aver&s;ion. 'It is not meet,' &s;aid he, 'to take the childrens' bread, and to ca&s;t it to dogs.' Inti|mating, that the Jews were the children of God, to whom all the privileges and ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant of Abraham belonged; and, as the Gentiles were vile and contemptible, they could not expect to &s;hare tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings with the &s;ons of I&s;rael. This an&s;wer, however &s;evere, did but &s;peak the language of the petitioner's humility, and therefore, it did not excite her re&s;entment, or cau&s;e her to go murmuring away; but&punc; acknow|ledging the ju&s;tice of his remark, &s;he meekly replied: 'Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their ma&s;ter's table.' Thus, continuing the &s;imilitude which our Lord had laid down, &s;he artfully introduced her own ca&s;e, and beautifully and meekly urged her petition, at a time when, it might have been expected, &s;he would have declined it with murmuring re&s;entment.</P>
<P>OUR Saviour, having thus given the woman an opportunity of manife&s;ting the &s;trength and &s;teadine&s;s of her faith, and declaring what ju&s;t notions &s;he had of her own unwor|thine&s;s, and the power and goodne&s;s of our great Redeemer, he now beheld her with a gracious &s;mile, commending her faith, and wrought the cure which &s;he had &s;o warmly and &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;olicited in behalf of her daughter; 'O woman,' &s;aid he, 'great is thy faith; be it unto thee even as thou wilt.' The&s;e gracious words were no &s;ooner &s;poken, than the great event followed; and the affectionate parent had rea&s;on to rejoice, for 'her daughter was made whole from that very hour.'</P>
<P>THIS affecting and intere&s;ting relation, &s;hould excite every per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are in di&s;tre&s;s of &s;oul, to be ardent, con&s;tant, and per&s;evering in their ad|dre&s;&s;es, to our great Redeemer. Whatever may be the nature of our di&s;tre&s;s, and
<PB N="102" REF="029927_0105_0FE336C0237B8EA0">
however impo&s;&s;ible it might &s;eem to us, that our comfort &s;hould be re&s;tored; yet there is the highe&s;t encouragement to &s;eek to that great Per&s;on, who is mighty to &s;ave, and in his own time and way, will deliver all that commit their ca&s;e to him, that believe in his name, and come to him for deliverance. Nor ought we to be di&s;couraged by the mo&s;t humbling views which we may have of our own unworthine&s;s: the Syrophoenician wo|man was an Heathen and an idolater, but yet &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not prevented by tho&s;e con&s;idera|tions, from imploring the pity of the Son of God: &s;he &s;ought it per&s;everingly, and &s;he found it. Thus, how lo&s;t &s;oever we may &s;uppo&s;e our condition to be, how de&s;perate &s;oever our ca&s;e, we ought not to de&s;pair: the mo&s;t humbling and aba&s;ing &s;en&s;e of our unworthine&s;s, ought not to keep us from the great Saviour of &s;inners, but rather urge us to follow him with our petitions, and ardently and vehemently implore his relief.</P>
<P>AND further, from the &s;ucce&s;s of this afflicted parent, we may be excited to per&s;eve|rance in our petitions, though we do not meet with the de&s;ired relief, after a long con|tinuance in our &s;upplications: the per&s;on who&s;e ca&s;e we are con&s;idering for &s;ome time met with no an&s;wer, and was afterwards repeatedly denied; but &s;till &s;he per&s;i&s;ted, and at la&s;t prevailed: &s;o, though the Lord &s;tands at a di&s;tance from us, leaves us to our &s;orrows, and does not an&s;wer our prayers in the time, or the way we might expect; &s;till we are encouraged to continue our addre&s;s: he is not offended at our importunity, he is not angry at our wants, nor weary of our cries; but the language of his words is, that we ought always to pray, and not to faint. Nor ought we to be weary of this pious practice though the Lord may &s;eem to deny our reque&s;t; though in&s;tead of removing our affliction and de&s;tre&s;s by his gracious &s;miles, he &s;eems to frown upon us, and lays fre&s;h burdens on our &s;ouls; though, at the time when we expected delive|rance, we meet with new di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and, though the Lord follows us with &s;troke after &s;troke, and lays one affliction upon another; &s;till we ought to continue our petitions, to lay them at his feet, to take no re&s;t till he an&s;wers our prayers, and to determine, that we will not let him go until he ble&s;s us. And we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that who&s;oever is enabled, like the Canaaniti&s;h woman, thus ardently, vehemently, humbly, and per&s;ever|ingly, to continue their &s;upplications to the Son of God, will &s;ooner or later, like her, find the de&s;ired relief.</P>
<P>JESUS being returned from the coa&s;ts of Tyre and Sidon, and taking a tour through the region of Decapolis, a man was brought to him who was deaf and dumb. The di|vine Phy&s;ician was always ready to relieve &s;uch objects of affliction and di&s;tre&s;s as applied to him: but, as the multitude thronged about him, expecting he would &s;oon &s;et up his kingdom, he thought proper to take the di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on and his relations a&s;ide from the throng; he then put his fingers in his ears, and touched his tongue, that the deaf man, who could not be informed by language, might mark the great per&s;on who was his benefactor. He then <HI>looked up to heaven, and &s;ighed, and &s;aid unto him, Epha|tha, that is, Be opened: and &s;traightway his ears were opened, and the &s;tring of his tongue was loo&s;ed, and he &s;pake plain. And he charged them, that they &s;hould tell no man.</HI></P>
<P>THIS injunction, however, was very little regarded; for, the man and his relations were &s;o elated with the benefit they had received, and the miraculous manner in which that benefit had been conferred, their hearts were &s;o full of gratitude to the great per&s;on from whom this un&s;peakable favour had been received, that they publi&s;hed it in every part of the country; doubtle&s;s, thinking they could not be too lavi&s;h in the prai&s;es of &s;o great a benefactor, e&s;pecially as the mode&s;ty in which he performed the miracles, fully manife&s;ted the uprightne&s;s of his intentions, and &s;hewed, that he did not aim at popular applau&s;e, but only &s;ought after the real benefit of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="029927_0106_0FE336C1A7931E68">THE va&s;t crowds that gathered about our exalted Redeemer, were &s;uch as it was a trouble to bear: he, therefore, to avoid &s;uch prodigious numbers of people as the fame of his miracles had brought together, retired to a de&s;ert mountain near the &s;ea of Galilee. But the &s;olitary &s;hades of the widlderne&s;s could not long conceal the great Benefactor of the human race: multitudes who were related to helple&s;s objects of di&s;tre&s;s, &s;oon di&s;|covered the place of his retreat, and brought to him from all quarters, the &s;ick, the lame, the blind, the dumb, and the maimed. The compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour of &s;inners was moved at the &s;ight of &s;o many piteous objects; he graciou&s;ly relea&s;ed them from their &s;everal complaints, and re&s;tored them to health and &s;trength. Miracles like the&s;e could not fail of exciting the veneration and wonder of the numerous &s;pectators: but above all, the re&s;toring the dumb to the faculty of &s;peech filled the beholders with a&s;toni&s;h|ment; for, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that he not only conferred on the&s;e per&s;ons the faculty of hearing, and pronouncing &s;ounds, but in&s;tantaneou&s;ly conveyed into their minds, the whole language of their country: they were in&s;tantly acquainted with the various words it contained, their &s;ignifications, their forms, their powers, and their u&s;es, and, at once acquired the habit of &s;peaking properly and fluently. This &s;urely was &s;ufficient to have convinced the mo&s;t ignorant and &s;tupid of the human race, that &s;uch works could be effected by nothing le&s;s than the mighty power of God; and, we are informed, that <HI>the multitude wondered when they &s;aw the dumb to &s;peak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to &s;ee, and they glorified the God of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>THE attending to the various cures our great Redeemer performed, detained the multitude three days in the de&s;ert; during which time, they had con&s;umed all the pro|vi&s;ions which they brought along with them into this &s;olitary retreat: no refre&s;hment was to be procured in the de&s;ert, and the kind, compa&s;&s;ionate JESUS would not &s;end them away fa&s;ting, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t any who had followed him &s;o far from their habitations, &s;hould faint by the way; and, therefore, he again exerted his almighty power to feed the multitude in the wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>WITH this view, our exalted Saviour called his di&s;ciples unto him, and &s;aid, <HI>I have compa&s;&s;ion on the multitude, becau&s;e they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat; and I will not &s;end them away fa&s;ting, le&s;t they faint by the way.</HI> The di&s;ciples, thought they had lately had &s;o plain a manife&s;tation of divine power on a like occa&s;ion, &s;eemed to wonder at the propo&s;al: <HI>Whence,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>&s;hould we have &s;o much bread in the wilder|ne&s;s, as to fill &s;o great a multitude?</HI> Their divine Ma&s;ter did not rebuke them for their unbelief, but calmly a&s;ked them, <HI>How many loaves have ye?</HI> To which they replied, <HI>Seven, and a few &s;mall fi&s;hes.</HI> Our great Redeemer then <HI>comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nded the multitude to &s;it down on the ground. And he took the &s;even loaves, and the fi&s;hes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his di&s;ciples, and the di&s;ciples to the multitude; and they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up the broken meat that was left, &s;even ba&s;kets full. And they that did eat, were four thou&s;and men, be&s;ides women and children.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not unworthy of remark, that the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, during the cour&s;e of his public mini&s;try, very frequently wrought his wonderful works, and publi&s;hed his divine di&s;cour&s;es in the &s;ilent retreats of the wilderne&s;s, and the &s;olitary &s;hades of the de&s;ert. Here he was followed by great numbers, who were di&s;ea&s;ed either in body or mind, and who came after him with a &s;incere de&s;ire of receiving benefit, either from the miraculous powers of healing which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or from the heavenly doctrines which he taught&punc; and, were not &s;incerely de&s;irous of receiving in&s;truction, would endure the hard&s;hips to which they were frequently expo&s;ed in the wilderne&s;s, where they were &s;ometimes two or three days without food: &s;o that we may ob&s;erve the wi&s;dom of our great Redeemer,
<PB N="104" REF="029927_0107_0FE336CF9B3AB7E8">
who took this method to collect together, the hone&s;t, plain-hearted part of the nation, who were more likely to be affected with his miracles, and profit by his in&s;tructions, than the proud rulers of the people, or the haughty and opulent inhabitants of the crowded cities, and it may be further remarked, that our heavenly In&s;tructor cho&s;e the&s;e de&s;ert places and ob&s;cure retreats, that he might have the opportunity of conveying his divine doctrines to the per&s;ons who&s;e hearts were prepared to receive them, without oppo&s;ition from the proud &s;elf-conceited Scribes and Phari&s;ees. How happy were people, who thus &s;at under the divine in&s;tructions of the Son of God! who left the bu&s;y, bu&s;tling &s;cenes of folly and di&s;&s;ipation in the crowded city, and retired to the &s;ilent and &s;olitary &s;hades of the de&s;ert, to attend to tho&s;e things which concerned their ever|la&s;ting peace; thus exchanging the loud roar of laughter and folly, for the calm dictates of eternal wi&s;dom; and, giving up the <HI>bread that peri&s;heth,</HI> for that <HI>which endureth to everla&s;ting life.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER having miraculou&s;ly fed the multitude, JESUS departed to the territory of Magdala, and appeared in a province of that country, called Dalmanutha. The Phari&s;ees, having heard that he had again fed the multitude, followed him there; for they feared that the common people would be convinced by his miracles, and acknowledge him to be the Me&s;&s;iah; and they were determined to oppo&s;e him with all their might, and openly and publicly confute whatever he advanced, with a view to prevent the nation from owning him under that character.</P>
<P>IN order to this, they boldly demanded of him a &s;ign from heaven, to make it plain, beyond all contradiction, that he was a greater prophet than Mo&s;es. JESUS replied, by rebuking their blindne&s;s and folly, who, by ob&s;erving the face of the &s;ky, could di&s;|tingui&s;h the &s;igns of fair and rainy weather, with a preci&s;ion which was fully manife&s;ted by the event; but, at the &s;ame time, they were &s;o blind and fooli&s;h, they could not perceive the evident manife&s;tation of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">filment of the prophecies re&s;pecting the Me&s;&s;iah, nor di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;igns of tho&s;e times which they &s;o ardently expected and de&s;ired. Had the Phari&s;ees duly attended to the evidences which our Lord produced to prove his divine mi&s;&s;ion, and examined them with the &s;ame care as they did the face of the &s;ky, when they predicted the fairne&s;s or foulne&s;s of the weather, they would doubtle&s;s have been convinced of the truth: but their ob&s;tinate and inveterate prejudices, prevented their receiving the Redeemer of I&s;rael, and filled their hearts with &s;o much pride and envy, that our divine In&s;tructor would not attempt their information and conviction; but fetching a deep &s;igh, becau&s;e of the hardne&s;s of their hearts, he declared, that their expected &s;ign &s;hould never be given them; and further ob&s;erved, that the only &s;ign which Divine Providence would allow them, was that of his own re&s;ur|rection from the cold regions of the dead, in which dark abodes he &s;hould be no longer held, than the prophet Jonah was in the belly of the whale. This miracle of our Lord's re&s;urrection, was a &s;ign greater than any which had formerly been &s;hewn by the ancient prophets, and was ju&s;tly in&s;i&s;ted on by our great Redeemer, to prove that he excelled and was far &s;uperior to them all: <HI>A wicked and adulterous generation,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;eeketh after a &s;ign; and there &s;hall no &s;ign be given unto it, but the &s;ign of the prophet Jonas.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING given this an&s;wer to the Phari&s;ees, our Lord departed with his di&s;ciples, and went by &s;ea to Beth&s;aida. During this &s;hort voyage, he cautioned his di&s;ciples to beware of the doctrine of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, which he introduced under the metaphor of leaven, de&s;cribed its wide-&s;preading contagion, and pernicious influence on the minds and actions of men. The&s;e hypocrites, valued them&s;elves for their zealous attachment to a religion, which con&s;i&s;ted in the &s;crupulous ob&s;ervance of frivolous
<PB N="105" REF="029927_0108_0FE336D120C2D358">
tradition, while they neglected the immutable duties of natural religion, as well as the weightier and more important precepts of the law: but the di&s;ciples, having for|gotten to take bread with them in their voyage, thought our Lord introduced the di&s;cour&s;e of leaven, to caution them again&s;t procuring it of the Heathens, or Samari|tans; for, though their Ma&s;ter had &s;o lately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the multitude in the de&s;ert, they had forgotten his miraculous power, and &s;eemed not to be &s;en&s;ible, that he who had fed ten thou&s;and per&s;ons with five loaves, was able, at all times, to provide for their nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>HAVING cro&s;&s;ed the lake, and landed at Beth&s;aida, there was brought to our Lord a blind man, and he was earne&s;tly intreated to re&s;tore him to &s;ight. He received the petition with his u&s;ual kindne&s;s, and taking the man by the hand, he led him out of the city; then he &s;pit in his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, and a&s;ked him, if he &s;aw any thing: to which, the man replied, <HI>I &s;ee men as trees walking:</HI> which words very pro|perly expre&s;s the indi&s;tinctne&s;s of his &s;ight: JESUS then laid his hands on him a &s;econd time, and he was immediately re&s;tored to clear, di&s;tinct, and perfect &s;ight.</P>
<P>IT is proper in this place to be remarked, that the inhabitants of Beth&s;aida, had, by their ingratitude, impenitence, and unbelief, greatly provoked our great Redeemer; and it may be &s;aid of this city, as it was of another, <HI>he would not do many mighty works there, becau&s;e of their unbelief:</HI> and this, no doubt, was the rea&s;on why he would not perform this miraculous cure in the city, but led the blind man into the fields; and &s;oon after departed into the territory of Cae&s;area-Philippi.</P>
<P>BEING retired into this country, our Lord thought proper to try the faith of the apo&s;tles; not that he did it for his own information, but that it might be manife&s;t to them&s;elves that they believed in the Lord. With this view, he a&s;ked them, <HI>Whom do men &s;ay that I, the Son of man, am?</HI> In an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, the di&s;ciples replied, <HI>Some &s;ay that thou art John the Bapti&s;t; &s;ome, Elias; and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</HI> The people in general, were convinced that JESUS was a great prophet; but though they were convinced of this, they did not acknowledge him as the Me&s;&s;iah. The rea&s;on of their mi&s;take is very apparent: they expected that the Me&s;&s;iah, when he appeared, would a&s;&s;ume the honours, grandeur, and power of a temporal kingdom; but, as JESUS di&s;|claimed and declined all earthly honours, they could not receive him under that character. JESUS, therefore, gave the di&s;ciples an opportunity of declaring what their conceptions were of his per&s;on and character; and, with this view, he a&s;ked them, <HI>But whom &s;ay ye that I am?</HI> To this que&s;tion, Peter immediately replied, <HI>Thou art Chri&s;t, the Son of the living God.</HI> With a conde&s;cending &s;mile, our Lord accepted the title, and, to te&s;tify his approbation of Peter's faith, immediately replied, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed art thou, Simon Bar-jonah: for fle&s;h and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</HI> Our great Redeemer, then alluding to the name of Peter, which &s;ignifies a rock, led him, and the re&s;t of the di&s;ciples, to a view of that eternal Rock, on the faith he had before expre&s;&s;ed, and the whole church of CHRIST re&s;ts, as on a &s;ure foundation. <HI>And I &s;ay unto thee,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it.</HI></P>
<P>IT cannot, without great ab&s;urdity, be concluded, that Peter was the rock on which CHRIST declared he would build his church: weak indeed, and ea&s;ily a&s;&s;aulted and overcome by the powers of hell, would the noble fabric be, if it re&s;ted on any creature; and much more &s;o, was it &s;upported by a weak, mutable, and fallible man: it is there|fore manife&s;t, that CHRIST him&s;elf is the Rock, on which his univer&s;al church, con|taining
<PB N="106" REF="029927_0109_0FE336D2A5894C78">
the whole number of his redeemed, is erected; and this is a foundation which will &s;tand for ever: not all the powers of earth and hell, can &s;hake the immovable ba&s;is of this rock: and who&s;oever is &s;o happy as to be fixed on this foundation, need not fear the dreadful earthquake, the ru&s;hing inundation, the raging tempe&s;t, or the devouring flame: not all the rage and confu&s;ion of a tumultuous world, can hurt &s;uch a per&s;on as this; but he may &s;tand &s;ecure amid&s;t the la&s;t convul&s;ions of expiring nature, and behold, without fear, "the wrecks of matter and the cru&s;h of worlds."</P>
<P>BUT our Lord proceeded to &s;hew the favourable regard which he had for his di&s;ciples, and the gifts which he would be&s;tow upon them; and, therefore, he adds, <HI>And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and what&s;oever thou &s;halt bind on earth, &s;hall be bound in heaven: and what&s;oever thou &s;halt loo&s;e on earth, &s;hall be loo&s;ed in heaven,</HI> Matth. xvi.19. As Peter had &s;poken in behalf of him&s;elf and the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles, &s;o our Lord lays down the&s;e gifts which were common to all; for the &s;ame words, with very little variation, are applied to the whole number, in Matt, xviii.18, and in John xx.23. They cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to contain a declaration of any &s;uperiority a&s;&s;igned to Peter over the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles; for, it is evident, that, when they afterwards di&s;puted on this head, and held any contention among&s;t them&s;elves, who &s;hould be greate&s;t, they were always reproved by their Ma&s;ter: nor can we find, that the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles ever confe&s;&s;ed any &s;uch &s;uperiority, or that Peter ever claimed it.</P>
<P>THE keys of the kingdom of heaven being given to the apo&s;tles, by a very ea&s;y and beautiful figure, repre&s;ents the &s;ucce&s;s of their mini&s;try. The kingdom of heaven, in the language of the evangeli&s;t, is the kingdom of grace, or the di&s;pen&s;ation of the glorious go&s;pel: and what can be more natural, than to &s;ay, that the keys of the king|dom of heaven are given to them who open tho&s;e noble truths to the &s;ons of men. And when it is &s;aid, that what&s;oever the apo&s;tles bind on earth &s;hall be bound in heaven; it evidently relates to the divine approbation of tho&s;e regulations and re&s;trictions, which the apo&s;tles &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h in the church; for binding and loo&s;ing, are frequently u&s;ed in the talmudical language, to repre&s;ent the allowing or forbidding particular &s;enti|ments and practices: &s;o that, from the whole, we may conclude, that however our Lord approved or applauded Peter's faith and zeal, he did not, by the&s;e declarations, intend to give him any pre-eminence or authority over the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CHRIST</HI> informs his Di&s;ciples of his Sufferings and Death: He declares, that he &s;hall judge the World, and gives a De&s;cription of the La&s;t Judgment: He is transfigured in the Pre&s;ence of three of his Apo&s;tles: At the Foot of the Mountain of Transfiguration, he cures a Youth, who had a dumb and deaf Spirit: And, returning to Capernaum, pays the Roman Tribute, with a piece of Money, taken out of the Mouth of a Fi&s;h by Peter, agreeable to his Ma&s;ter's Direction.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE di&s;ciples, as they &s;till retained their expectations of a temporal kingdom, were, doubtle&s;s, highly elated with the di&s;cour&s;e of their Ma&s;ter, which they had lately heard; giving them the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and enabling them to bind and loo&s;e with &s;uch authority, were very agreeable to them: and, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that they explained the&s;e grants to mean &s;ome great temporal powers and honours they were
<PB N="107" REF="029927_0110_0FE336D42BF62298">
to be inve&s;ted with. Their divine Leader, to abate their high &s;welling conceits, and to lead them into clearer views of the nature of his kingdom, and the final i&s;&s;ue of his mini&s;try among&s;t the Jews, informed them that it was appointed in the eternal councils of his Father, that he &s;hould be rejected by the rulers of I&s;rael, per&s;ecuted with the utmo&s;t malice, followed with fal&s;e accu&s;ations, and, at la&s;t, put to death as a malefactor, with circum&s;tances of the greate&s;t cruelty and public &s;hame.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples were exceedingly alarmed at this prediction of their Ma&s;ter; he had ju&s;t before accepted the title of the Me&s;&s;iah, and declared, that he would be&s;tow high honours, peculiar privileges, and extraordinary powers on his apo&s;tles; and his now declaring, that he &s;hould be arraigned, condemned, and put to death as a malefactor, was &s;o con|trary to their expectations, that they thought it impo&s;&s;ible to be true. Peter, who was of a warmer temper than the re&s;t, heard his Ma&s;ter talk of dying at Jeru&s;alem with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, and could not forbear hinting, that he did not believe it to be true; and he proceeded to blame his Ma&s;ter, for mentioning any &s;uch thing. For this bold|ne&s;s, our Lord &s;harply rebuked him: <HI>Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me; for thou favoure&s;t not the things that be of God, but tho&s;e that be of men.</HI></P>
<P>IT was the fal&s;e notions of the nature of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom which Peter had imbibed, and his love to the world, and de&s;ires after its grandeur and glory, which in|duced him to utter that imprudent language, which brought &s;o &s;evere a rebuke from his Ma&s;ter. It was, therefore, a le&s;&s;on, which our Redeemer, at this time, thought pe|culiarly proper to inculcate, that all who would afterwards obtain that glory which be|longed to the &s;ubjects of his kingdom, mu&s;t deny them&s;elves; that is, they mu&s;t always be ready to give up every worldly plea&s;ure, every thing which tends to gratify the &s;en&s;es, and even life it&s;elf, whenever the cau&s;e of CHRIST required it. And he informed them, that who&s;oever pur&s;ued the glory and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of his kingdom, in &s;uch a way as to be likely to obtain it, mu&s;t expect to meet with trouble, vexation, di&s;appointment, affliction, and di&s;tre&s;s: for, our Lord declared, that he who would be his di&s;ciple, mu&s;t take up his cro&s;s daily, and follow him.</P>
<P>OUR Lord thus opened to his di&s;ciples the true nature of his kingdom, and let them know, that it was quite the rever&s;e of what they had expected: for, though they had undergone many afflictions, difficulties, and trials, there were greater and more &s;evere exerci&s;es of their patience and fortitude &s;till to come; the&s;e it would be in vain to at|tempt to &s;hun or evade, for they mu&s;t follow their Ma&s;ter in the foot-&s;teps of his afflic|tion, which, if they attempted to &s;hun, they would fall into greater evils; but tho&s;e who per&s;evered in the way of their duty with patience and fortitude, though they might lo&s;e their temporal lives, they would certainly gain an happy immortality: <HI>For who&s;o|ever,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>will &s;ave his life, &s;hall lo&s;e it: but who&s;ever &s;hall lo&s;e his life for my &s;ake, the &s;ame &s;hall &s;ave it. For what is a man profited, if he &s;hall gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul? Or what &s;hall a man give in exchange for his &s;oul?</HI></P>
<P>OUR great Redeemer, having explained to his attentive di&s;ciples, the u&s;age they mu&s;t expect to find from the world, and the reproach, trouble, affliction, and variety of di&s;tre&s;s which they mu&s;t expect to go through; he then thought proper to change the &s;cene, and repre&s;ented to them the grandeur, glory, dignity, and maje&s;ty in which he &s;hould appear, when tho&s;e &s;ufferings were at an end: <HI>For the &s;on of man,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;hall come in the glory of his Father; and then he &s;hall reward every man according to his works.</HI> This con&s;ideration might have been abundantly &s;ufficient to quiet their minds, and re|concile them to the various difficulties, troubles, and afflictions which lay before them.
<PB N="108" REF="029927_0111_0FE336DF85978C90">
Then their de&s;pi&s;ed Ma&s;ter will appear in greater glory and dignity than the mo&s;t pompous earthly prince; he will a&s;&s;ume the birth-right of the &s;kies, and &s;it as the &s;u|preme judge of heaven and earth: then will his enemies meet with the puni&s;hment which they have &s;o ju&s;tly de&s;erved, and his friends mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly receive their eternal reward; but tho&s;e who, through fear of the difficulties and troubles which lay before them, have de&s;erted his cau&s;e, will find them&s;elves de&s;erted, and finally rejected at that awful day; for, &s;aid our great Redeemer, <HI>Who&s;oever, therefore, &s;hall be a&s;hamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and &s;inful generation, of him al&s;o &s;hall the Son of man be a&s;ham|ed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</HI></P>
<P>AS this is the fir&s;t time which our exalted Redeemer mentioned this great event to his di&s;ciples, it may not be ami&s;s to take a &s;hort view of this grand, magnificent, awful, and mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;cene. As the Son of God is the exalted per&s;on who &s;hall judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, let us, for a moment, contemplate the glory, grandeur, and dignity in which he will appear: he him&s;elf declares, that he will appear <HI>in the glory of his Father, and with the holy angels:</HI> he will appear arrayed in the maje&s;ty of that God, who dwells in light, and who&s;e glory no mortal can approach; not the ble&s;|&s;ed inhabitants of the heavenly world, can bear the blaze of that boundle&s;s glory which &s;urrounds the eternal throne, but veil their faces in the pre&s;ence of that God, who dwells in light, and fills the heavenly regions with the boundle&s;s blaze of uncreated brightne&s;s. How &s;mall, how dim a &s;peck is the &s;un, when compared with the eternal fountain of light, or with the brightne&s;s of that God, who pours the beamy radiance from world to world, and could, with one ray of glory darted from his throne, light up a thou&s;and &s;uns.</P>
<P>IN this boundle&s;s brightne&s;s, and maje&s;tic pomp, will the Son of God appear. Ah! how unlike the de&s;pi&s;ed Galilean; how unlike the per&s;on, who groaned and bled on Calvary! Not now attended with twelve weak di&s;ciples, twelve mean, illiterate fi&s;her|men; but &s;urrounded with myriads of cele&s;tial &s;pirits, and numberle&s;s ho&s;ts of mighty angels. With what cele&s;tial pomp, with what unutterable brightne&s;s, they de&s;cend through the &s;ky, while the &s;un, overpowered with exce&s;&s;ive light, &s;hrinks and di&s;appears; and the whole bright a&s;&s;embly de&s;cends from heaven <HI>with a &s;hout, with the voice of the archangel, and the trump of God.</HI> The trumpet, with tremendous roar, re&s;ounds through the regions of the dead: the dead awake and ri&s;e; &s;ome exulting with joy at the &s;ight of their Saviour, and others terrified, confounded, and filled with inexpre&s;&s;ible horror, at the &s;ight of their judge: the great and mighty, the rich and noble, warriors, cap|tains, princes, and potentates who ruled the world, and did what they plea&s;ed among&s;t the &s;ons of men, now have lo&s;t all their honours and command, and are filled with the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, amazement, and di&s;may: they cannot bear the brightne&s;s of the Judge, they would plunge into eternal darkne&s;s, to avoid his piercing eye, and they call upon the rocks and mountains to fall on them, <HI>and hide them from the face of him that &s;itteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of his wrath is come; and who &s;hall be able to &s;tand.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER reluctant, they are forced to appear: urged by &s;trong nece&s;&s;ity, and driven by frowning angels, they crowd to the bar, and &s;tand, trembling and a&s;toni&s;hed, on the left-hand of their Judge. The elect of God, gathered by angels from the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth, are placed on the right-hand; they lift up their heads with joy, and, beholding the great Judge of heaven and earth, with exultation and tran&s;port can &s;ay, <HI>This is our God, we have waited for him; we will be glad and rejoice in him.</HI> And now the time is come, when flagrant outrageous vice &s;hall be thrown down and de&s;pi&s;ed, op|pre&s;&s;ed,

afflicted virtue &s;hall be exalted; now is the time, when the my&s;teries of Pro|vidence &s;hall be unveiled, when all the clouds and darkne&s;s, which &s;urrounded the ways of God, will be cleared away, and the wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, and goodne&s;s of divine conduct, fully vindicated, both in tho&s;e who are &s;aved, and tho&s;e who peri&s;h: now the church of CHRIST, his &s;potle&s;s bride, purcha&s;ed with his blood, &s;hall appear in all her glory and beauty, all vain hypocritical pretenders will be expo&s;ed, and every thing that offendeth, done away.</P>
<P>AN awful &s;ilence is proclaimed; the books are opened; the &s;ecrets of all hearts, and every dark deed which had been carefully concealed, are brought to light, and then the exalted King of the univer&s;e, who fits in Judgment, proceeds to pa&s;s that &s;entence, which mu&s;t &s;tand for ever. With looks of the mo&s;t kind, conde&s;cending goodne&s;s, and un&s;peakable complacency and delight, he fir&s;t beholds the happy heirs of life and glory, who had been enabled, by his grace, to believe in him for life and &s;alvation, and bring forth &s;uch fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s, as were honourable to his cau&s;e: the&s;e happy &s;ouls look up to their Judge, with &s;uch emotions as are above de&s;cription, and, with inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, hear him pronounce this heart-expanding &s;entence, <HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; for I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink; I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was &s;ick, and ye vi&s;ited me; I was in pri&s;on, and ye came unto me.</HI></P>
<P>THE redeemed of the Lord, with ineffable joy, receive the approbation of their Judge; but their meek and humble hearts will not take any prai&s;e to them&s;elves, nor a&s;cribe the happine&s;s they are going to receive to any thing done by them; and there|fore, they meekly reply, 'Lord when &s;aw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thir&s;ty, and gave thee drink? When &s;aw we thee a &s;tranger, and took the in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when &s;aw we thee &s;ick, or in pri&s;on, and came unto thee.' Our Lord approves and commends their humility, but at the &s;ame time, to let the whole a&s;&s;embled world know, how kindly he accepted of every in&s;tance of the kindne&s;s and benevolence they had &s;hewn to his people, he adds, 'Ina&s;much as ye have done it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren, ye have done it unto me.'</P>
<P>THE Judge then changes his countenance, and, with a look of indignation and ri&s;ing wrath, which pierces through the inmo&s;t &s;oul, he beholds the guilty wretches, who &s;tand trembling at his left hand: filled with con&s;cious guilt, and all the agonies of rag|ing de&s;pair, they &s;tand expecting their final doom, while the&s;e accents break from the lips of their angry Judge: 'Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat; I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me no drink; I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; &s;ick and in pri&s;on, and ye vi&s;ited me not.' The wicked, how|ever con&s;cious of guilt, not recollecting the preci&s;e acts of kindne&s;s and contempt of the Son of God, here literaly &s;pecified, are emboldened to reply. <HI>Lord, when &s;aw we thee an hungered, or athir&s;t or a &s;tranger, or naked, or &s;ick, or in pri&s;on, and did not mini&s;ter unto thee?</HI> However willing they may be to ju&s;tify them&s;elves, our Lord well knows the naughtine&s;s of their heart, and is fully acquainted with their evil deeds, and, there|fore, he confounds them for ever with this reply; 'Ina&s;much as ye did it not to one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e, ye did it not to me.'</P>
<P>THE final and eternal &s;entence thus pa&s;&s;ed, the execution immediately &s;ucceeds: a legion of mighty angels drive the black, horrid train of trembling &s;inners from the
<PB N="110" REF="029927_0113_0FE336E352ECECC8">
judgment &s;eat; and, caught in a fiery tempe&s;t, they are precipitated into their dreadful place of puni&s;hment; the gulph of eternal horror and de&s;pair &s;tretches wide its burning jaws to receive them at their fall; and they are tormented with fire and brim&s;tone, in the pre&s;ence of the holy angels, and in the pre&s;ence of the Lamb: and the &s;moke of their torment a&s;cendeth up for ever and ever.</P>
<P>MEAN while, the friends and favourites of the eternal king, are conducted to the pa|radi&s;e of God, and &s;afe lodged in the realms of eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and re&s;t: the&s;e happy realms, formed by the eternal God for the abode of his people, contain every thing which can &s;atisfy the pure de&s;ires of an immortal &s;pirit, and fill the &s;oul with holy and ever-growing delight; now every fear, every &s;orrow, and every &s;in is done away; and the happy inhabitants of this glorious place, drink full &s;treams of bli&s;s, and partake of tho&s;e joys which proceed from the throne of God, and of the Lamb: now the redeemed of the Lord, forming one va&s;t, one happy &s;ociety, dwell in that &s;plendid city, where the full glory of the eternal God is manife&s;t in that exalted Saviour, who is emphati|cally &s;tyled, 'the brightne&s;s of his Father's glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on.' Here every happy believer in the Son of God, dwells in the pre&s;ence of his Saviour; beholds this &s;upreme object of his love, face to face, and is clothed by him in the beauty and glory of immortality. But all de&s;cription fails: the human mind, in its pre&s;ent beclouded &s;tate, cannot bear the blaze of immortal glory, nor receive any ade|quate ideas of that boundle&s;s bli&s;s, which the Lord will be&s;tow on his people: <HI>For eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive what God hath prepared for tho&s;e that love him.</HI></P>
<P>AS this doctrine of CHRIST's being appointed, the univer&s;al Judge of heaven and earth, might &s;eem incredible to the di&s;ciples; e&s;pecially, as our Lord had but ju&s;t be|fore given them the humbling account of his &s;ufferings and death; he proceeded to inform them, that &s;ome who heard him &s;peak, &s;hould &s;ee &s;o much of his glory and his kingdom while they lived, as &s;hould convince them, that his declaration was true: <HI>Verily, I &s;ay unto you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>there be &s;ome &s;tanding here, which &s;hall not ta&s;te of death, till they &s;ee the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</HI> Agreeable to this prediction, the di&s;ci|ples lived to &s;ee the transfiguration of their Ma&s;ter, and to be witne&s;&s;es of his glorious re&s;urrection, and his triumphant a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven; they lived to &s;ee the de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t, and the doctrines of the go&s;pel propagated in various remote parts of the world; and &s;ome of them lived to &s;ee that awful and ample di&s;play of divine ven|geance, manife&s;ted in the de&s;truction of that unbelieving race, who were the pro|fe&s;&s;ed enemies and murderers of the Lord of life, and that wicke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> city where he was crucified.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e great events &s;ucceeded the declaration in about &s;ix days, when our great Redeemer being with the multitude in the country of Cae&s;area-Philippi, he left them in the plain, and, accompanied by Peter, James, and John, a&s;cended an ex|ceeding high mountain. In this &s;olitude, while our Lord was praying, he was tran&s;|figured; his face a&s;&s;umed a glorious radiance, and emitted a beamy brightne&s;s, not inferior to the &s;un &s;hining in its &s;trength; his garment &s;hone with a &s;nowy whitene&s;s, far beyond any thing which human art could produce, and, like the fair beams of the morning light, glowed with a &s;weet refulgence, not inferior to the brightne&s;s of his countenance. Thus, for a &s;hort time the Son of God appeared in his native glory, and the maje&s;tic brightne&s;s of his divinity &s;hone through the veil of his human nature. To heighten the &s;olemnity of the &s;cene, Mo&s;es, the great lawgiver of I&s;rael, and Elijah,

the great prophet of the Lord, and &s;upporter of the law, appeared in the beauties of immortality, and &s;hone in tho&s;e robes with which the inhabitants of the heavenly Jeru|&s;alem are adorned.</P>
<P>IT appears that the di&s;ciples, being heavy with &s;leep at the time of prayer, did not &s;ee the beginning of this glorious &s;cene; they, however, awaked in the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, to behold the place &s;hining with heavenly glory; they had lo&s;t the fir&s;t part of this bright di&s;play of our Redeemer's divinity, and of the conver&s;ation he held with the two great prophets who came down from heaven on this great occa&s;ion; but they heard &s;o much, as gave them to under&s;tand, that the&s;e glorious per&s;ons had been talk|ing of tho&s;e things which their Ma&s;ter had lately informed them of. His &s;ufferings and death, which would &s;oon be accompli&s;hed at Jeru&s;alem, though they appeared to them of &s;uch an humbling nature, and contrary to the character of the Me&s;&s;iah, they found were not unworthy the contemplation of the greate&s;t per&s;onages of the heavenly world; and though the mentioning them, had lately given &s;uch offence to Peter, he perceived that they were &s;poken of by per&s;ons of &s;uperior dignity and under&s;tanding, as highly honourable to the character of his Ma&s;ter. But the feeble nerves of the three di&s;ciples could not bear the blaze of heavenly glory; they were amazed, con|founded, and terrified, and &s;carce knew where they were, or how they ought to behave: but the forwardne&s;s of Peter's di&s;po&s;ition prompted him to &s;ay &s;omething on the occa|&s;ion, though he con&s;idered not the propriety or tendency of it: <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, one for Mo&s;es, and one for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> having beheld &s;uch glory, as never before darted on mortal &s;ight, and &s;een his Ma&s;ter a&s;&s;ume an appearance of grandeur and maje&s;ty, far beyond his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, he concluded, no doubt, that JESUS had now taken upon him his proper dignity, and that the temporal kingdom, which he had &s;o ardently de&s;ired, and impa|tiently expected, was now actually begun; e&s;pecially as Elias, according to the prophecy of Malachi the prophet, had made his appearance; he no doubt, concluded that he was come from heaven to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the rearing the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom: Peter, therefore, thought it highly nece&s;&s;ary to provide &s;ome accommodation for his Ma&s;ter, and his noble com|panions; perhaps, he intended to bring the re&s;t of the di&s;ciples, and the multitude, who were waiting below, to behold the peerle&s;s glory of their Ma&s;ter, and his augu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tants; this, he thought, would be much better, and more honourable for him, than being put to death at Jeru&s;alem, or &s;uffering tho&s;e things which had been the &s;ubject of the late heavenly conver&s;ation; the de&s;ign of which, Peter, at this time, could not comprehend: but, <HI>while he yet &s;pake, a bright cloud over&s;hadowed them: and, behold, a voice out of the cloud, which &s;aid, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed; hear ye him</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the three di&s;ciples heard the voice, which was va&s;tly different to any they had heard before, and, at the &s;ame time, that it &s;eemed &s;oft as the &s;outhern breeze, yet it was awful and maje&s;tic as the thunder's roar; impre&s;&s;ed with trembling awe, they fell with their faces to the ground, and continued in that po&s;ture, till their compa&s;&s;ionate Ma&s;ter came to them, and gently touched them, bid them ari&s;e, and not be afraid. They imme|diately looked about them, but the heavenly &s;cene was withdrawn, and no per&s;on was &s;een but their divine Ma&s;ter, in the plain and unadorned form in which he appeared before he a&s;cended the mountain.</P>
<P>OUR Lord, having continued on the &s;ummit of the mountain all night with his three di&s;ciples, he early in the morning de&s;cended to the plain, and charged them to conceal
<PB N="112" REF="029927_0115_0FE336F0340CBCD0">
what they had &s;een, till he was ri&s;en from the dead. He was well aware, that the world, and even his own di&s;ciples, were &s;trangers to his &s;piritual kingdom, and had no idea of his a&s;cending to heaven, and being highly exalted at the right hand of God: therefore, they could not comprehend the de&s;ign of his transfiguration, and it was unnece&s;&s;ary to publi&s;h it before his re&s;urrection, as it could not be de&s;cribed; and, perhaps, would not have been believed: and the pre&s;ent appearance of our Redeemer, joined with the afflictions, per&s;ecutions, &s;ufferings, and &s;orrows which lay before him, might &s;till tend to prejudice the minds of the people, and prevent them from believing any account of his exaltation and glory.</P>
<P>NOR were the di&s;ciples, at this time, able to under&s;tand the doctrine of CHRIST's re|&s;urrection; they had never learnt that the Me&s;&s;iah was to die, nor had they any con|ception of his ri&s;ing from the dead; for they were fully per&s;uaded that he was to abide for ever, and that his kingdom was to have no end. They &s;eemed very much &s;urpri&s;ed at the departure of Elias, and at their Ma&s;ter's cea&s;ing to &s;hine in the glorious manner they had &s;o lately beheld on the mountain: nor could they comprehend the meaning of the prophet Malachi, who had prophe&s;ied of the coming of Elias, which their readers of the law explained to refer to a time, prior to the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah. After long debating among&s;t them&s;elves, they concluded to apply to their Ma&s;ter, to &s;olve the diffi|culty, and therefore a&s;ked him, <HI>Why &s;ay the Scribes, that Elias mu&s;t fir&s;t come?</HI> To this inquiry, our Lord replied, that the Scribes had rightly explained the prophecy of Malachi, by declaring that Elias mu&s;t come before the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah; but, at the &s;ame time, he informed them, that this great prophet had made his appearance, and had been u&s;ed by that perver&s;e generation, in the &s;ame manner as the prophets of old had been treated by their fathers: <HI>But I &s;ay unto you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him what&s;oever they li&s;ted: likewi&s;e &s;hall al&s;o the Son of man &s;uffer of them. Then the di&s;ciples under&s;tood that he &s;pake to them of John the Bapti&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN JESUS de&s;cended to the foot of the mountain, attended by his three di&s;ciples, he &s;aw a great multitude &s;urrounding the nine, who had continued with the people while our Lord had been transfigured, and the Scribes di&s;puting with them. The people &s;eeing JESUS approach, ran to him with exultation and joy, and &s;aluted him with the warme&s;t gratitude, and the mo&s;t re&s;pectful reverence. Our Lord having joined the company, he immediately a&s;ked the Scribes, what was the &s;ubject of their debate with his di&s;ciples? to which one of the company an&s;wered, <HI>Ma&s;ter, I have brought unto thee my &s;on, which hath a dumb &s;pirit; and where&s;oever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gna&s;heth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I &s;pake unto thy di&s;ciples, that they &s;hould ca&s;t him out, but they could not.</HI></P>
<P>THIS an&s;wer &s;eems to indicate, that the Scribes had been reproaching the di&s;ciples, on account of their inability to re&s;tore the afflicted youth: and, no doubt, they rejoiced, that, at la&s;t, a devil had appeared who was too hard for them, and, perhaps, would not &s;ubmit to their Ma&s;ter. Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;omething like this had been the &s;ubject of their conver|&s;ation, is evident from our Saviour's reply: <HI>O faithle&s;s generation,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>how long &s;hall I be with you? How long &s;hall I &s;uffer you?</HI> After having &s;poken in this manner to the proud, &s;elf-conceited, &s;ceptical Scribes, our Lord turned to the father of the afflicted young man, and &s;aid, <HI>Bring thy &s;on hither.</HI> The afflicted father obeyed; but no &s;ooner was the youth brought into the pre&s;ence of the great ruler of earth and heaven, than the evil &s;pirit attacked him with double fury: <HI>the &s;pirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="029927_0116_0FE336F2A207F5B8">IT is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS could not have prevented this furious attack; but he was plea&s;ed to &s;uffer it, probably, that the minds of the &s;pectators might be the more affected with the deplorable condition of the &s;ufferer, and have the more ju&s;t and lively ideas of that wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s, which &s;hould give him relief; and, it is probable, with the &s;ame views, he a&s;ked the mournful father, how long his &s;on had been in this pitious condition? To which he replied, <HI>Of a child. And oft times it hath ca&s;t him into the fire, and into the waters to de&s;troy him: but, if thou can&s;t do any thing, have compa&s;&s;ion on us, and help us.</HI></P>
<P>IT &s;eems, that the inability of the di&s;ciples to ca&s;t out this evil &s;pirit, had greatly di&s;couraged the afflicted father: and the exqui&s;ite torture, and apparent agonies of his &s;on, and the remembrance of their long continuance, had di&s;pirited him &s;o much, that he began to fear, that this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was too &s;trong for the power of JESUS him&s;elf, as the Scribe had affirmed; which was the rea&s;on of his expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;o much he&s;itation and doubt, when he told our Lord, how long his &s;on had been afflicted. But JESUS, to make him &s;en&s;ible of his mi&s;take, as well as gently to reprove him for his unbelief, and groundle&s;s fears, &s;aid unto him, <HI>If thou can&s;t believe, all things are po&s;&s;i|ble to him that believeth.</HI> The father, affected with this declaration, and with a heart full of tenderne&s;s and joy, at the &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ibility of the relief of his &s;on, replied with tears, <HI>Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.</HI> The vehement manner in which the afflicted parent &s;poke the&s;e words, cau&s;ed the crowd to gather about him; when <HI>Je&s;us rebuked the &s;oul &s;pirit; and &s;aid unto him, Thou dumb and deaf &s;pirit, I charge thee come out of him, and enter no more into him.</HI></P>
<P>THE awful voice, at which all the devils tremble, had no &s;ooner pronounced the&s;e words, than the devil, with an hideous howling, and convul&s;ing the tormented youth in the mo&s;t frightful manner, came out; leaving the youth, in a manner, &s;en&s;ele&s;s and motionle&s;s, as one dead. Our Lord then, taking him by the hand, re&s;tored him to life, and delivered him perfectly recovered, both in body and mind, to his father.</P>
<P>THE nine di&s;ciples, who had un&s;ucce&s;sfully attempted to drive out this ob&s;tinate demon, remained mo&s;t attentively &s;ilent during this tran&s;action; doubtle&s;s they were glad to find, that this dreadful and powerful devil, was not an over-match for their Ma&s;|ter, however they were mortified to find, that he was too hard for them. They were very de&s;irous to know the rea&s;on, why they could not di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s this demon, as they had done others, but did not chu&s;e to a&s;k their Ma&s;ter in the hearing of the multitude; but when he had retired, they a&s;ked him, why they failed in their attempt to re&s;tore the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed young man? Our Lord informed them, it was becau&s;e of their unbelief, <HI>For,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>if ye have faith as a grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed, ye &s;hall &s;ay unto this mountain, re|move hence to yonder place, and it &s;hall remove; and nothing &s;hall be impo&s;&s;ible to you.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord then retired to the unfrequented parts of Galilee; and in this &s;olitary retreat, he again in&s;tructed his di&s;ciples in the nature of his kingdom, and the de&s;ign of his coming into the world; laying before them a view of his &s;ufferings, death, and &s;peedy re&s;urrection. There, doubtle&s;s, was a nece&s;&s;ity of inculcating the&s;e di&s;agreeable and unpopular truths frequently on their minds; for, though they mu&s;t remember how &s;harply Peter was reproved for oppo&s;ing the declaration of the&s;e events, yet our Lord's predictions concerning this matter, were very &s;lowly received; and the national prejudices which the di&s;ciples had &s;o &s;trongly imbibed, which repre&s;ented the grandeur, glory and perpetuity of the Me&s;&s;iah's temporal kingdom, would not permit them to be|lieve it po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould die.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="029927_0117_0FE336F427C92288">AFTER having abode a &s;hort time in the de&s;ert part of Galilee, our Lord returned to Capernaum, the place of his general abode. Soon after his arrival at that city, the tax&punc;gatherers applied to Peter, inquiring if his Ma&s;ter would pay the tribute: Peter promi&s;ed them that his Ma&s;ter would &s;atisfy their demand; but, on further con&s;idera|tion, was afraid to mention the thing to him: perhaps he thought it derogatory to the dignity of &s;o great a per&s;on to pay tribute to any potentate on earth. But, how|ever cautious Peter might be of mentioning the affair, it was no &s;ecret to his Ma&s;ter, which our Lord &s;oon appri&s;ed him of, by propo&s;ing the following que&s;tion: <HI>What thinke&s;t thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take cu&s;tom or tribute? Of their own chil|dren, or &s;trangers? Peter &s;aith unto him, Of &s;trangers. Je&s;us &s;aith unto him, Then are the children free.</HI> Peter, by this que&s;tion, was fully &s;atisfied, that our Lord knew his thoughts, and had fully penetrated the affair which was in agitation; he was al&s;o convinced, that, as the Son of God, and heir of all things, he was under no obligation to pay tribute to the greate&s;t monarch on earth: but our Lord, to avoid giving offence, conde&s;cended to &s;ubmit to the claim; and propo&s;ed to Peter the following miraculous method of rai&s;ing the money: <HI>Go thou to the &s;ea,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and ca&s;t an book, and take up the fi&s;h that fir&s;t cometh up, and when thou ha&s;t opened his mouth, thou &s;halt find a piece of money; that take, and give it unto them for me and thee.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord, by this miraculous manner of paying that tribute, which he was under no obligation to pay, teaches us, that in all common ca&s;es, we &s;hould avoid giving of|fence to the civil power; and rather &s;ubmit to a demand, which may &s;eem burden&s;ome and oppre&s;&s;ive in a &s;mall degree, than offend our brethren, or di&s;turb the tranquility of the &s;tate. And &s;ure it becomes the children of the Prince of peace to avoid all occa&s;ions of contention and di&s;cord, and rather give up &s;ome &s;mall part of their pro|perty, than give the rulers of the &s;tate any rea&s;on to complain. It may further be ob|&s;erved, that this miracle is a manife&s;t proof of the omnipre&s;ence of the Son of God; no le&s;s a per&s;on than he, who knows all things and is pre&s;ent in all places, could know that the fi&s;h had the piece of money in its mouth, while it was covered with the roll|ing &s;urges of the &s;ea; and that this &s;ame fi&s;h, &s;till holding the piece of money, would come to Peter's hook. The&s;e are mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing events, and with the re&s;t of the mi|racles wrought by our great Redeemer, blaze out like a bright con&s;tellation, adorn his royal crown, and proclaim him the great King of the univer&s;e, the &s;upreme Lord of heaven and earth.</P>

<P><HI>CHRIST</HI> reproves his Di&s;ciples for their fooli&s;h Contention about Superiority: He an&s;wereth the Petition of the Mother of Zebedec's Children, and checketh the Indignation of the other Di&s;|ciples thereat: He teacheth how to treat an offending Brother, and how oft to forgive him, by the Parable of a King, who puni&s;hed one of his Servants for refu&s;ing that Mercy to his Fellow, which he had experienced from his Lord in a larger Degree: He then goeth to Je|ru&s;alem at the Fea&s;t of Tabernacles, where he teacheth in the Temple: The Rulers &s;end Of|ficers to apprehend him, who being &s;truck with his Di&s;cour&s;e, return without him, and are rebuked by the Phari&s;ees, who chide Nicodemus for taking his part. <HI>CHRIST</HI> afterwards letteth go, uncondemned, the Woman taken in Adultery.</P>

<P>THOUGH our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had lately given his di&s;ciples an affecting account of his &s;ufferings and death; and though their minds &s;eemed to be very much ca&s;t down and di&s;pirited at the expectation of events, &s;o mournful and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in them|&s;elves, and &s;o contrary to their expectations; yet their grief &s;eems to be of no long

continuance, nor had they yet given up their favourite notion of the Me&s;&s;iah's temporal kingdom: for, not many days after, they had &s;o far forgot the predictions of their Ma&s;ter, that they were engaged in a warm di&s;pute concerning the po&s;ts of honour in that kingdom. On what grounds &s;everal of the di&s;ciples advanced their preten&s;ions to be greate&s;t, is not related by the evangeli&s;ts; but it is very plain, that tho&s;e claims did not originate from any intimations given them by their Ma&s;ter, of his de&s;ign to ad|vance any of them above the re&s;t; for he very &s;everely rebuked them for their pride and folly, and they were fearful of letting him know what &s;ubject they had been di&s;|puting about.</P>
<P>OUR Lord did not directly proceed to reprimand his di&s;ciples on account of the above conver&s;ation, but fir&s;t a&s;ked them, what they were di&s;puting about by the way? They were confounded at the que&s;tion, and, as they knew it would be in vain to at|tempt, either to evade a di&s;covery, or to conceal the truth, they feared to return an an&s;wer. JESUS, perceiving their confu&s;ion, &s;oon gave them to under&s;tand, that he well knew the &s;ubject of their debate, and that he highly di&s;approved it: having commanded their particular and earne&s;t attention to what he was going to advance, he &s;aid, <HI>if any man de&s;ires to be fir&s;t, the &s;ame &s;hall be la&s;t, and &s;ervant of all.</HI> And then, to teach them the u&s;eful le&s;&s;on of humility, he took a little child, and &s;et him in the mid&s;t of them: <HI>Verily, I &s;ay unto you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye &s;hall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Who&s;oever, therefore, &s;hall humble him&s;elf as this little child, the &s;ame is greate&s;t in the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
<P>AS our Lord, at this time, thought proper to di&s;countenance all preten&s;ions to &s;upe|riority among&s;t his di&s;ciples, it is evident, that he had given no &s;upremacy to Peter, when he declared his approbation of his declaration of faith, as before related. Had he, when he told that di&s;ciple that he gave him <HI>the keys of the kingdom of heaven,</HI> de&s;igned to exalt him above the re&s;t of the di&s;ciples: or had they under&s;tood his words in that &s;en&s;e, they could not po&s;&s;ibly have been at any lo&s;s to know who was to be the great|e&s;t; nor is it likely they would have contended about an affair which had in the pre|&s;ence of them all, been finally &s;ettled by their Ma&s;ter: neither is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, that, if our great Redeemer had given the pre-eminence to Peter, he would have blam|ed his di&s;ciples for talking about it, and not on this occa&s;ion have confirmed his former grant.</P>
<P>THE ju&s;tice of this remark is further confirmed by the an&s;wer which our great Re|deemer gave to the wife of Zebedee, when &s;he pre&s;ented a petition to him in behalf of her &s;ons; &s;he had &s;trongly imbibed the national error of the Jews, re&s;pecting the Me&s;|&s;iah's kingdom; and, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed that her &s;ons, from their near relation to our Lord, might claim a peculiar &s;hare in his favour, &s;he pre&s;ented her reque&s;t, that one might &s;it on his right hand, and the other on his left, in his kingdom. To this peti|tion, our Saviour replied, <HI>To &s;it on my right hand, and on my left hand, is not mine to give; but it &s;hall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</HI></P>
<P>THE re&s;t of the di&s;ciples having heard the reque&s;t, and remarked our Redeemer's reply, were much offended at the pride and vanity of the brothers, and could not &s;ee any rea&s;on, why they &s;hould expect &s;o peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hed a mark of favour. To put an end to all contention on &s;o weak and frivolous an account, our Lord call|ed his di&s;ciples in &s;uch a manner, as to engage and fix their attention, and &s;aid unto them, <HI>Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles, exerci&s;e lord&s;hip over them; and their great ones exerci&s;e authority upon them; but &s;o it &s;hall not be amongst you,
<PB N="116" REF="029927_0119_0FE33701B2E9DBF8">
but who&s;oever will be great amongst you, &s;hall be your mini&s;ter; and who&s;oever of you will be the chiefe&s;t, &s;hall be the &s;ervant of all.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH is the language of our great Redeemer, who is &s;ole king and lawgiver in his church; and may we not ju&s;tly conclude, that the pretences of the church of Rome to infallibility and &s;upremacy, which &s;he would have us believe have de&s;cended from the apo&s;tle Peter to the pope, as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, have no foundation in &s;cripture or rea&s;on, but are unju&s;t and arbitrary u&s;urpation, de&s;igned to advance and enrich the prie&s;thood, and impoveri&s;h, abu&s;e, and en&s;lave mankind.</P>
<P>THE exalted Saviour of mankind, having thus gently rebuked his di&s;ciples for their eager and unabating de&s;ires after worldly grandeur, John, one of the &s;ons of Zebedee, perhaps to give a turn to the conver&s;ation, informed his Ma&s;ter, that they had &s;een one ca&s;ting out the devils in his name, and had forbidden him, becau&s;e he had not joined him&s;elf to their company. To which our Lord replied, that they ought not to have forbidden him, becau&s;e no per&s;on would attempt to work miracles in his name, who did not entertain a very ju&s;t conception of his divinity. <HI>Forbid him not,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>for there is no man which &s;hall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly &s;peak evil of me.</HI></P>
<P>BY this language our Redeemer exorted them to con&s;ider, that who&s;oever did not oppo&s;e him, may be con&s;idered as his friends; and the ca&s;ting out devils in his name, would advance his reputation; and promote his intere&s;t, though the devils them&s;elves, and the per&s;ons who rejected them, might de&s;ign the contrary: he further informed them that the lea&s;t degree of friend&s;hip and re&s;pect &s;hewn to his cau&s;e, though it was no more than a cup of cold water given to his di&s;ciples, when they &s;tood in need of &s;uch a favour, was acceptable to him, and would certainly find its full reward hereafter. <HI>Who&s;oever,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;hall give you a cup of cold water in my name, becau&s;e you belong to Chri&s;t; verily, I &s;ay unto you, he &s;hall not lo&s;e his reward.</HI> At the &s;ame time, our Lord gave them to under&s;tand, that the lea&s;t di&s;couragement to his &s;ervants in their duty, would be remarked, and puni&s;hed with the greate&s;t &s;everity: <HI>And who&s;oever &s;hall offend one of the&s;e little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a mill&s;tone were hanged about his neck, and he were ca&s;t into the &s;ea.</HI></P>
<P>FROM hence our great Redeemer took occa&s;ion to remark, that it was better and more advantageous to us, to deny our&s;elves the enjoyment of tho&s;e things which are mo&s;t plea&s;ing to our &s;en&s;e, and which our corrupt affections might be as loth to part with, as with an hand, a foot, or an eye, than by any indulgence or &s;en&s;ual gratifica|tion, to give offence to the di&s;ciples of CHRIST, or prevent the &s;ucce&s;s of his go&s;pel: and, as the di&s;ciples of CHRIST were appointed to preach the glorious go&s;pel to a wick|ed world, to &s;hew all nations the &s;tupidity and folly of their idolatry, to teach the un|corrupted wor&s;hip of the true God, and the practice of every virtue, JESUS exhorted them to be particularly careful of their conduct and behaviour; for, if their lives were di&s;honourable to the cau&s;e of the go&s;pel, they would be u&s;ele&s;s and de&s;pi&s;ed, like &s;alt which had lo&s;t its favour. But among&s;t all the vices which prevail in the hearts of mankind, there is none more contrary to the nature and genius of the religion of JESUS, or more likely to prevent the u&s;efulne&s;s of the preachers of his go&s;pel, than a &s;pirit of pride; of this, therefore, our Lord particularly cautioned his di&s;ciples to be|ware; for, he a&s;&s;ured them, that the meane&s;t per&s;on is an object of the paternal care of the great Creator, and is &s;upported and defended by his particular providence; &s;uch, therefore, are not to be de&s;pi&s;ed; for our Lord declared, that their angels do always behold the face of his heavenly Father.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="029927_0120_0FE3370337D50B88">AND to &s;hew the particular notice and care which his eternal Father takes of his peo|ple, and with what tender regard he always beholds the believers in his Son, our great Redeemer proceeded in this manner, 'How think ye,' &s;aid he, 'if a man have an hun|dred &s;heep, and one of them be gone a&s;tray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and &s;eeketh that which is gone a&s;tray? And if it be, that he finds it, verily, I &s;ay unto you, he rejoiceth more of that &s;heep, than of the ninety and nine which went not a&s;tray. Even &s;o, it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of the&s;e little ones &s;hould peri&s;h.'</P>
<P>OUR Lord having declared the heavy vengeance which would certainly fall on all who injured his di&s;ciples, and oppo&s;ed the propagation of his go&s;pel; and ob&s;erved the ten|der care with which his Almighty Father beholds his people, and their certainty of pro|tection and defence; he proceeds to warn them of taking their cau&s;e into their own hands, and pur&s;uing, with ha&s;ty and unrea&s;onable re&s;entment, any who had offended them. 'If thy brother,' &s;aid he, '&s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he &s;hall hear thee, thou ha&s;t gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es, every word may be e&s;tabli&s;hed. And if he &s;hall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man, and a publican.'</P>
<P>OUR Saviour then proceeds to inform them, that the Supreme Judge of heaven and earth will intere&s;t him&s;elf in their behalf, when they are ju&s;tly offended, and the &s;entence which they pa&s;s on &s;uch offenders will be ratified in heaven: 'Verily, I &s;ay unto you,' proceeded he, 'what&s;oever ye &s;hall bind on earth, &s;hall be bound in heaven: and what|&s;oever ye &s;hall loo&s;e on earth, &s;hall be loo&s;ed in heaven.' The meaning of this is, that if the method you take with an offending brother is ble&s;&s;ed to the end you de&s;igned, and he is brought to a repentance, he is loo&s;ed from the guilt of his &s;in, and &s;tands acquitted at the bar of &s;upreme ju&s;tice: but, on the other hand, if all methods are u&s;ed in vain, and the offender &s;till continues impenitent, and per&s;i&s;ts in his evil ways, he is bound by the chains of his guilt, and cannot e&s;cape de&s;erved puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour then proceeded to lay down &s;ome con&s;iderations, which ought to encourage good men to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to convince &s;inners of the error of their ways, and bring them to &s;incere repentance, and to offer up their earne&s;t and per|&s;evering prayers to the God of all grace, for his divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;o great a work, by which only it can be effected: for our Lord informs them, that his heavenly Father would always hear their prayers, and grant their petitions, if con&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;igns of his providence, and the methods of his grace. 'Again, I &s;ay unto you,' &s;aid he, 'that if two of you &s;hall agree on earth, as touching any thing that they &s;hall a&s;k, it &s;hall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven: for where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them.'</P>
<P>PETER had carefully attended to the doctrine of forgivne&s;s of injuries, as inculcated by his Ma&s;ter; doubtle&s;s, he &s;aw the beauty and dignity of &s;uch a rule of conduct, and de&s;ired it to be further explained: 'Lord,' &s;aid he, 'how oft &s;hall my brother &s;in again&s;t me, and I forgive him, till &s;even times?' It &s;eems by this que&s;tion, that, however great and noble he apprehended this rule of conduct to be, he thought it was nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve &s;ome re&s;trictions in the practice of it; but his Ma&s;ter informed him, that it mu&s;t not be limitted to &s;even times, but carried on to &s;eventy times &s;even, if the ca&s;e re|quired it.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="029927_0121_0FE33704C25E1828">IN order to &s;hew the beauty and dignity of this excellent moral precept, and the nece&s;&s;ity of forgiving the greate&s;t injuries in every ca&s;e, where the offending per&s;on is &s;en&s;ible of his fault, and promi&s;es amendment; our Lord, by way of illu&s;tration, pro|po&s;ed the parable of two &s;ervants, debtors to one lord: 'Therefore,' &s;aid he, 'is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his &s;er|vants. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thou&s;and talents. But, for as much as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be &s;old, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. The &s;ervant, therefore, fell down, and wor&s;hiped him, &s;aying, lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. Then the lord of that &s;ervant was moved with compa&s;&s;ion, and loo&s;ed him, and forgave him the debt. But the &s;ame &s;ervant went out, and found one of his fellow-&s;ervants, which owed him an hundred pence; and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, &s;aying, pay me that thou owe&s;t. And his fellow-&s;ervant fell down at his feet, and be&s;ought him, &s;aying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And he would not: but went and ca&s;t him into pri&s;on till he &s;hould pay the debt.'</P>
<P>'So when his fellow-&s;ervants &s;aw what was done, they were &s;orry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. Then his lord, after that he had called him, &s;aid unto him, O thou wicked &s;ervant, I forgave thee all that debt, becau&s;e thou de&s;ired&s;t me: &s;houlde&s;t not thou al&s;o have had compa&s;&s;ion on thy fellow-&s;ervant, even as I had pity on thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him unto the tormentors, till he &s;hould pay all that was due unto him.'</P>
<P>BY this affecting narrative, our Lord beautifully di&s;plays the extent of divine forgiv|ne&s;s, and the obligations which the &s;ons of men, to whom God hath forgiven &s;o much, are under to forgive one another. God is the great king and &s;overeign of all creatures, to him all are accountable, as &s;ervents are to a ma&s;ter; he keeps a regi&s;ter of their actions, as a trade&s;man keeps an account of his debts, and a day will &s;urely come when they will be called to a reckoning. The &s;ervant who owed ten thou&s;and talents, repre|&s;ents every man that lives in the world: the enormous debts which men owe to their Creator, is but faintly de&s;cribed by that prodigious &s;um; for their &s;ins of thought, word, and deed, which the mo&s;t correct and regular of mankind commit, exceed all concep|tion, and may ju&s;tly be compared to the &s;tars of heaven for multitude, or the &s;and on the &s;ea &s;hore. The plea of the in&s;olvent debtor 'Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all,' is an elegant de&s;cription of the expectations of men in general, to obtain the divine forgivne&s;s, by their future good behaviour, and thinking to perform &s;uch good deeds as may make amends for their former guilt; but the lord, knowing how impo&s;&s;i|ble it was for this &s;ervant to pay this enormous &s;um, had compa&s;&s;ion on him, and freely forgave the debt. Hence, we learn the freene&s;s of divine forgivne&s;s; it is not on ac|count of any thing which has been done, or can be done by the &s;ons of men, that the great Jehovah is induced to pardon their iniquities; but his forgivn&s;s &s;lows from the rich fountain of his own infinite mercy, that mercy which he hath magnified, and fully mani|fe&s;ted to the world in the go&s;pel of his Son: and who&s;oever is made partaker of the rich ble&s;&s;ing of divine forgivne&s;s, is laid under the highe&s;t obligations to forgive his fellow-creatures, and to extend that forgivne&s;s, if required, beyond the limits pre&s;cribed by our Lord, even beyond the number of &s;eventy times &s;even: but &s;uch is the corruption and depravity of the human heart, that we are too prone to forget, or carele&s;sly overlook the mercies received, and con&s;ider not how ju&s;tly the great Judge of heaven and earth might call us to a &s;trict account for our numerous offences, while we are pur&s;uing our fellow-creatures with implacable re&s;entment; nor do we con&s;ider how much we are indebted to

the &s;upreme Lord of univer&s;al nature, while, like the unmerciful &s;ervant, we take our fellow-creature by the throat, with, 'Pay me what thou owe&s;t.' But who&s;oever duly con|&s;iders the va&s;t debt they owe to God, and are enabled to rely on his infinite mercy for for|givne&s;s; if they have a ju&s;t view of their unworthine&s;s and in&s;olvency, and are enabled to &s;eek forgivne&s;s in the way which God hath appointed, will, in a greater or le&s;s degree, be careful to cultivate a placable forgiving frame of mind; e&s;pecially when they con&s;ider tho&s;e remarkable words with which our Lord concludes this narrative: for having decla|red, that the lord delivered the cruel &s;ervant 'to the tormentors, till he &s;hould pay all that was due unto him;' he adds, '&s;o likewi&s;e &s;hall my heavenly Father do al&s;o unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not one another your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.'</P>
<P>HAVING delivered the&s;e precepts, our great Redeemer departed into Galilee, pa&s;&s;ing through the country beyond Jordan; by that means giving the Jews which inhabited that country an opportunity to hear his heavenly di&s;cour&s;es, and to receive the benefit of his all-healing power: and after having taken a tour through tho&s;e di&s;tant parts, he returned to his own city Nazareth.</P>
<P>THE fea&s;t of tabernacles now approached, when the males of the Jewi&s;h nation, capable of travelling, repaired to Jeru&s;alem, and dwelt &s;even days in the tabernacles, or booths made of boughs of trees, in commemoration of their fathers having had no other habitation during their forty years &s;ojourning in the wilderne&s;s. Some of the kin&s;men of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, being about to take a journey to the capital on this occa|&s;ion, they de&s;ired him to accompany them thither, and openly &s;hew him&s;elf to the whole nation of the Jews. They did not believe, that he was really the Me&s;&s;iah &s;o long ex|pected by their nation, and they condemned his conduct, as unnatural and ab&s;urd, from a per&s;on who made &s;uch preten&s;ions: they could not conceive what induced him to &s;pend &s;o much of his time in de&s;erts, and remote parts of the kingdom, while he a&s;&s;umed &s;o public a character as that of the Redeemer of I&s;rael. Jeru&s;alem, the &s;eat of power, the habitation of the great men of the nation, and the place of general re|&s;ort, was, in their opinion, the propere&s;t place for him to publi&s;h his doctrines, and work his miracles in: the&s;e, they thought, being exhibited in public, before the great and learned men of the nation, might have a better effect, than being performed in ob&s;cure retreats among&s;t the ignorant and illiterate. The deci&s;ion of the doctors of the law, and the great men of the nation in his favour, they thought would increa&s;e the number of his di&s;ciples, and be a means of inducing the whole nation to own him for the Me&s;&s;iah, whether he were really that great per&s;on or not: <HI>Depart hence,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>and go into Judea, that thy di&s;ciples al&s;o may &s;ee the works that thou doe&s;t: for there is no man that doeth any thing in &s;ecret, and him&s;elf &s;eeketh to be known openly. If thou do the&s;e things, &s;hew thy&s;elf to the world.</HI></P>
<P>BUT our Lord was no &s;tranger to the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem, and, therefore, he did not think proper to re&s;ide among&s;t them any longer than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: he well knew their inveterate prejudices, their ob&s;tinacy and prever&s;ene&s;s, and their prevail|ing unbelief; and was fully convinced, that they would not receive his doctrines, nor be induced, by his miracles, to believe in him, but would be more likely to u&s;e all their power to de&s;troy him, before he had fini&s;hed the work, which he a&s;&s;umed our nature to perform: for which rea&s;ons he did not choo&s;e to accompany his relations to the fea&s;t, or go in a public manner to Jeru&s;alem: <HI>My time,</HI> &s;aid our great Redeemer, to the&s;e unbelieving relations, <HI>is not yet come: but your time is always ready. The world cannot hate you: but me it hateth, becau&s;e I te&s;tify of it, that the works thereof are evil. Go ye up unto this fea&s;t: I go not up yet unto this fea&s;t: for my time is not yet full come.</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="029927_0123_0FE337119DD44E88">
This was as though he had &s;aid, it is not expedient that I &s;hould go to Jeru&s;alem before the fea&s;t begins: you may advance to the city whenever you plea&s;e, there is nothing to make you afraid; the Jews are your friends, you have never offended them, nor have you done any thing to di&s;plea&s;e them: but the purity of the doctrine I have preached among&s;t them, and the plainne&s;s and freedom of &s;peech with which I have oppo&s;ed their fooli&s;h traditions, and reproved their hypocri&s;y, and other enormous vices, have rai&s;ed their re&s;entment, and provoked their malice to the utmo&s;t height; and, therefore, as the time of my &s;uffering is not yet come, it is not proper for me to go &s;o &s;oon to Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>PERHAPS there might be another rea&s;on why our Redeemer did not choo&s;e to ac|company his relations to the fea&s;t of tabernacles at this time: the va&s;t concour&s;e of people which annually attended this &s;olemnity, would fill all the roads to the capital, and the&s;e gathering around him, and attending him to Jeru&s;alem, would have made a noi&s;e in the city, and have given fre&s;h offence to his enemies, which might have exa&s;perated them to that degree, that they might, as they had done before, have attempted his life, and their cruelty and rage might have prevented his doctrine and miracles having their proper effect: he, therefore, cho&s;e to continue in Galilee till the crowd were gone up to the the fea&s;t, when he followed, <HI>as it were in &s;ecret,</HI> neither preaching nor working miracles by the way; &s;o that no crowd followed him, nor was there any rejoicing at his approach.</P>
<P>AS JESUS did not go publicly to Jeru&s;alem, &s;o neither did he, on his arrival, repair to the temple, and there preach openly to the people. This gave ri&s;e to &s;everal di&s;|putes among&s;t the Jews concerning his character and conduct; &s;ome affirmed that he was a true prophet, and his not coming to the fea&s;t could only ari&s;e from &s;ome acci|dent, which had prevented him; others maintained that he was an impo&s;ter and de|ceiver, and though he a&s;&s;umed the &s;acred character of a prophet, he did not keep the law; nor regard the in&s;titutions which they had received from heaven.</P>
<P>BUT about the middle of the fea&s;t, JESUS appeared openly in the temple, and pub|licly taught the people, delivering his divine di&s;cour&s;es with energy, force, and &s;pirit, and &s;uch &s;trength of rea&s;oning joined with &s;uch elegance of expre&s;&s;ion, that his enemies were a&s;toni&s;hed, as they knew he had not enjoyed the benefit of a learned education. <HI>Now, about the mid&s;t of the fea&s;t, Je&s;us went up and taught. And the Jews marvelled, &s;ay|ing, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</HI> To this the exalted Saviour of mankind replied: My doctrine was not produced by human wi&s;dom; the learned men and &s;ages of this world were not my in&s;tructors; but I received it from heaven, and it is the doctrine of the great, &s;upreme, eternal Father of the univer&s;e, who&s;e me&s;&s;enger I am: <HI>My doctrine,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is not mine, but his that &s;ent me.</HI> And our Lord further ob|&s;erved, that it might be gathered from the manner of his teaching, that his doctrine was really divine; he &s;ought not the prai&s;e of man, he did not &s;tand candidate for popular applau&s;e, he did not &s;eek to advance his own intere&s;t, but the eternal intere&s;t of mankind, and the glory of the heavenly Father: <HI>He that &s;peaketh of him&s;elf,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;eeketh his own glory; but he that &s;eeketh his glory that &s;ent him, the &s;ame is true, and no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s is in him.</HI></P>
<P>SOME of the Jews pre&s;umed to call JESUS a fal&s;e prophet, becau&s;e, in the porches of the pool of Bethe&s;da, he had healed an impotent man on the Sabbath-day, which, they pretended was a violation of the law of Mo&s;es, and what a good man would not be guilty of: in an&s;wer to which, our great Redeemer told them, that however they might

<P>TO this charge the Jews replied, <HI>Thou ha&s;t a devil: Who goeth about to kill thee?</HI> To which JESUS an&s;wered to this effect, I have performed a miracle, in favour of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed poor man, on the Sabbath-day: this you think contrary to the character of a good and pious man, and wonder how I could undertake it; but I can give you an example out of your own law, in the ca&s;e of circumci&s;ion: Mo&s;es gave you that law, and you make no &s;cruple of performing the in&s;titution on the Sabbath-day: you think your|&s;elves ju&s;tified in this, becau&s;e it is a precept both of Mo&s;es and the fathers. Since, therefore, ye think your&s;elves bound to di&s;pen&s;e with the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the Sab|bath, in order to perform a ceremonial precept, can you be angry with me becau&s;e I, on the Sabbath-day, have fulfilled the mo&s;t &s;acred and immutable part of the moral law, by curing a man who was infirm in all the members of his body, and have not exerted &s;o much bodily labour as you do in the practice of the rite of circumci&s;ion: con&s;ider therefore, the nature of the thing, be not blinded by prejudice, be no longer attached to fooli&s;h traditions, or &s;uper&s;titious opinions; but make u&s;e of your rea&s;on, &s;hew your|&s;elves men, and judge impartially: <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;aid our great Redeemer, <HI>therefore gave unto you circumci&s;ion (becau&s;e it is of Mo&s;es, but not of the fathers); and ye on the Sabbath-day circumci&s;e a man. If a man on the Sabbath-day receive circumci&s;ion, that the law of Mo&s;es &s;hould not be broken; are ye angry at me, becau&s;e I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath-day? Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH the Jews could not an&s;wer this argument, they would not be convinced, but objected to JESUS's being the Me&s;&s;iah, becau&s;e they were acquainted with his parents and relations: they apprehended, that when the Me&s;&s;iah appeared, his pedigree and rela|tion&s;hip would not be known; and they founded their opinion on a pa&s;&s;age in the prophet I&s;aiah, <HI>Who &s;hall declare his generation?</HI> They were full of re&s;entment and malice, and &s;ome of them were de&s;irous that he &s;hould be apprehended; but Divine Provi|dence would not permit them to accompli&s;h their cruel purpo&s;e, becau&s;e the time of his &s;ufferings were not yet come. But though his enemies beheld hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with rancour and contempt, yet many of the people, convinced by his miracles, affected by his divine di&s;|cour&s;es, and &s;atisfied with the unan&s;werable rea&s;ons which he had advanced in &s;upport of his character, believed on him, and publicly in the temple affirmed that he was the Me&s;&s;iah. The Evangeli&s;t informs us, that <HI>many of the people believed on him, and &s;aid, When Chri&s;t cometh, will he do more miracles than the&s;e which this man hath done?</HI> John vii.31.</P>
<P>THE Scribes and Phari&s;ees beheld the attachment of the common people to the Saviour of &s;inners, with the highe&s;t indignation and contempt, and were &s;o provoked, that they could bear it no longer; and, accordingly, on the la&s;t and great day of the fea&s;t, they met in council to con&s;ider on &s;ome means to prevent his growing popularity: the re&s;ult of their deliberations, was a determination to apprehend him; and, accor|dingly, the proper officers were di&s;patched from the council to arre&s;t him, and bring him before them.

<P>NOT under&s;tanding that our Saviour alluded to his death, re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion to the right hand of God, whither no per&s;on in the body could follow him, the Jews were very much puzzled with this declaration, and could by no means under&s;tand the mean|ing of it: they could form no other conjecture concerning the meaning of the&s;e words, than that our Lord de&s;igned to leave Judea, and go among&s;t the Gentiles, to preach among&s;t their brethren who were di&s;per&s;ed in the neighbouring nations: but they were aware, that this conjecture did not an&s;wer to the latter part of our Lord's declaration: for though he &s;hould go among&s;t the Gentiles, it would not be impo&s;&s;ible for them to follow hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they, therefore, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, rea&s;oned among&s;t them&s;elves, and inquired, <HI>Whither will he go, that we &s;hall not find him?

What manner of &s;aying is this that he &s;aid, Ye &s;hall &s;eek me, and &s;hall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE our exalted Redeemer was teaching in the temple, according to the annual cu&s;tom, the water of the pool of Siloam was brought in. Part of this was drank in the temple with loud acclamations, in commemoration of the great deliverance wrought for their fathers, who were miraculou&s;ly relieved and pre&s;erved by a &s;tream which flowed from a hard dry rock, and revived the nation which was fainting with thir&s;t: the other part was poured out as a drink-offering, accompanied with their prayers to the Al|mighty, for the former and latter rain to fall in their &s;ea&s;on; which ceremony was con|cluded by the whole congregation, &s;inging this pa&s;&s;age out of the prophet I&s;aiah, <HI>With joy &s;hall ye draw water out of the wells of &s;alvation.</HI> chap. xii.3.</P>
<P>IT was the con&s;tant mode of in&s;truction which our great Redeemer pur&s;ued, to ac|commodate his di&s;cour&s;es to the particular occa&s;ion and circum&s;tances of his hearers, and to engage and fix their attention, by alluding to occurrences and objects actually in view; and, accordingly, he took this opportunity of repre&s;enting the rich ble&s;&s;ings which &s;inful creatures would receive from him under the metaphor of water: and, in allu&s;ion to the ceremony which they had &s;een performed, <HI>In the la&s;t day, that great day of the fea&s;t, Je&s;us &s;tood and cried, &s;aying, If any man thir&s;t, let him come unto me, and drink.

<P>WHILE our Lord was thus &s;peaking to the people, with a beautiful &s;implicity, and heart-affecting &s;trength and energy, &s;uch as never were joined before, the officers &s;ent from the council to apprehend him, came into the temple: before they proceeded to the execution of their mi&s;&s;ion, they &s;taid a few moments to hear his di&s;cour&s;e; to this they were excited by their curio&s;ity, but his divine eloquence overcame their re&s;ent|ment, removed their prejudices, and melted away their rage: the harmony of his pro|nunciation, the beautiful &s;implicity, and plainne&s;s, and the amazing &s;trength, energy, and clearne&s;s of his rea&s;oning, di&s;played the beauties of divine truth, and cau&s;ed them to &s;hine on the under&s;tanding with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s brightne&s;s; even his enemies who were &s;ent from the council to apprehend him, were a&s;toni&s;hed and overcome: the greatne&s;s of the &s;ubject affected their minds, and its importance filled their under&s;tandings: the warmth and tenderne&s;s with which he delivered his di&s;cour&s;es, fixed their attention and penetrated their hearts; they felt new and uncommon emotions, and overwhelmed with the greatne&s;s of their admiration, were fixed in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment; they were ab&s;olutely overcome, and could not think of executing the commi&s;&s;ion which brought

them to the temple; they blamed them&s;elves for having undertaken it, and returned to the rulers of I&s;rael without performing it.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the remor&s;ele&s;s di&s;po&s;ition of the per&s;ons who are u&s;ually &s;ent about &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s, and the nature of the &s;ubject which employed our great Redeemer's eloquence, we &s;hall have rea&s;on to join the officers in their admirations, and to acknow|ledge that our great Redeemer's elocution was &s;uperior to all prai&s;e: &s;uch &s;urely that di&s;cour&s;e mu&s;t be, which addre&s;&s;ed to others, and on a divine &s;ubject, could di&s;arm the re&s;olution of the mo&s;t determined enemy, and penetrate the rece&s;&s;es of the mo&s;t un|feeling heart.</P>
<P>NOR were the officers the only per&s;ons who were affected with this divine di&s;cour&s;e: for the &s;urrounding multitude were &s;en&s;ible of very remarkable impre&s;&s;ions, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed their wonder in various conjectures; many of them declared he mu&s;t certainly be one of the old prophets, and others, that he could be no le&s;s than the Me&s;&s;iah him|&s;elf; others, led away with the common mi&s;take, that he was born at Nazareth, a&s;ked, with &s;nearing di&s;dain, if the Me&s;&s;iah was to come out of Galilee, when the &s;cripture has ab&s;olutely declared, that he was to be born in Bethlehem, the native town of his father David. Thus we are informed, <HI>Many of the people, therefore, when they heard this &s;aying, &s;aid, Of a truth, this is the prophet: others &s;aid, this is the Chri&s;t; but &s;ome &s;aid, Shall Chri&s;t come out of Galilee? Hath not the &s;cripture &s;aid, That Chri&s;t cometh of the &s;eed of Da|vid, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was.</HI> This di&s;pute was carried to &s;uch an height, that &s;ome of them, knowing that the officers were &s;ent to apprehend our Redeemer, threatened to lay hands on him: but divine Providence would not permit them to execute their cruel de&s;ign; for though <HI>&s;ome of them would have taken him, yet no man laid hands on him.</HI></P>
<P>THE officers now returned to the council, and were a&s;ked, with warmth, why they had not brought JESUS of Nazareth, whom they were &s;ent to apprehend? They endeavoured to excu&s;e them&s;elves, by relating the manner in which they were overcome, and di&s;armed by his eloquence: <HI>No man,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>&s;pake like this man.</HI> But if they thought to &s;often the re&s;entment of the council, by declaring what a wonderful man JESUS CHRIST was, and what an heart-affecting &s;train of divine eloquence flowed from his lips, they were very much mi&s;taken: the perjudices of the rulers of I&s;rael were too de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">-rooted, and their rancour and malice too inveterate to be &s;o ea&s;ily overcome: their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ride &s;corned to &s;ub|mit to the dictates of the unpopular and unlearned, and, with indignation and &s;corn, they replied, <HI>Are ye al&s;o deceived! Have any of the rulers, or of the Phari&s;ees believed on him? But this people, who knoweth not the law, are cur&s;ed.</HI> They thought it a piece of the mo&s;t unparalleled impudence, that the common people &s;hould pre&s;ume to acknowledge JESUS to be the Me&s;&s;iah, when the great doctors of the law, the chief prie&s;ts and Phari&s;ees, and all the learned men of the nation, publicly oppo&s;ed his preaching, defamed his character, and determined to de&s;troy him.</P>
<P>BUT their pride and envy &s;oon received a &s;evere reprimand from Nicodemus, who had formerly attended on JESUS by night; and was convinced that he was the Me&s;&s;iah, though he did not openly confe&s;s him, for fear of the Jews. On this occa&s;ion he rebu|ked the pride and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency of the enemies of JESUS, by inquiring, <HI>Does our law condemn any man before he is heard.</HI> They had ju&s;t now condemned their officers for be|ing ignorant of the law, when it appeared that them&s;elves where more ignorant, by pre|tending to condemn a per&s;on before they had proved him guilty: they were acting di|rectly contrary to the fundamental principles of the law of equity, at the &s;ame time, that they boa&s;ted their &s;uperior knowledge of, and clo&s;e&s;t attachment to its precepts.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="029927_0128_0FE33722CE2A8A88">THIS &s;harp reproof of Nicodemus, &s;o highly exa&s;perated the whole council, that, with an air of indignation and contempt, they a&s;ked him, if he al&s;o was one of tho&s;e mean per|&s;ons who had joined together to &s;upport the preten&s;ions of a Galilean, though the &s;criptures had plainly declared, that Bethlehem was the place of the Me&s;&s;iah's nativity: to which they added, that, if he refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to them, he &s;hould &s;earch the &s;criptures, and he would &s;oon be convinced, that the great prophet, mentioned by Mo&s;es, was not to be born in Galilee: <HI>Art thou al&s;o of Galilee? &s;aid they. Search and look: for out of Galilee ari&s;eth no prophet.</HI></P>
<P>THE council &s;oon broke up, after making this an&s;wer to Nicodemus, and our Lord, well knowing their malicious intentions, retired to the Mount of Olives, where he &s;pent the night with his di&s;ciples; but early the next morning he returned to the temple, and taught the people.</P>
<P>THE Scribes and Phari&s;ees pur&s;ued him with unabating re&s;entment, and were deter|mined either to render him odious to the people, or an offender in the eye of the Roman governor. Accordingly, they brought before him, a woman who had been taken in the act of adultery; de&s;iring him to declare what puni&s;hment &s;he ought to &s;uffer: <HI>This woman,</HI> &s;aid they to our great Redeemer, <HI>was taken in adultery, in the very act. Now Mo&s;es in the law, commanded us, that &s;uch &s;hould be &s;toned: but what &s;aye&s;t thou?</HI> Had JESUS pre&s;umed to pardon the adultere&s;s, and inflicted no puni&s;hment on her, they would, doubtle&s;s, have repre&s;ented him as a per&s;on who contradicted the law, and favoured adultery, which would certainly have rendered him odious in the eyes of the people. On the other hand, had he ordered her to be &s;toned, it would have afforded an opportunity of accu&s;ing him to the Roman governor, as a per&s;on who &s;tirred up the peo|ple to rebellion; the Romans having, at that time, taken the power of life and death out of the hands of the Jews. But JESUS well knew their wicked intentions, and therefore made them no an&s;wer, <HI>but &s;tooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</HI> They, not &s;atisfied, &s;till continued pre&s;&s;ing him to give an an&s;wer; when, at la&s;t, JESUS, in allu&s;ion to the law, which ordered that the hands of the witne&s;&s;es, by who&s;e te&s;timony a criminal was convicted, &s;hould fir&s;t be upon him, &s;aid, <HI>He that is without &s;in among you, let him fir&s;t ca&s;t a &s;tone at her.</HI> Our Lord well knew the hearts, and the &s;ecret crimes of the&s;e furious accu&s;ers, and he delivered the&s;e words in &s;uch a man|ner, as convinced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ery per&s;on pre&s;ent, that he was acquainted with their &s;ecret lewdne&s;s and debauchery. This &s;udden rebuke, had &s;uch an effect on them, that they could not reply, but immediately departed, no doubt, fearing if they had &s;taid, JESUS would have expo&s;ed their mo&s;t &s;ecret tran&s;actions, and abominable crimes: they, therefore, dur&s;t not proceed in their accu&s;ation, but, <HI>being convicted by their own con&s;ciences, went out one by one, beginning at the elde&s;t, even unto the la&s;t: and Je&s;us was left alone, and the woman,</HI> who had been <HI>&s;tanding in the mid&s;t.</HI> JESUS had been, all the while the Jews were retiring, &s;tooping down and writing on the ground, as though he did not perceive what they were about: but now ri&s;ing up, and looking upon the woman who &s;tood alone, he a&s;ked her, if &s;he had been condemned? To which &s;he an&s;wered in the negative. Our Lord &s;aw her covered with &s;hame, and knowing her repentance was &s;incere, he looked upon her with an eye of pity and forgivne&s;s; and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her with the&s;e gracious words, <HI>Neither do I condemn thee; go and &s;in no more.</HI></P>

<P><HI>CHRIST</HI> declareth him&s;elf to be the Light of the World, and ju&s;tifieth his Doctrine again&s;t the Phari&s;ees: He promi&s;eth Freedom, through Knowledge of the Truth, to tho&s;e Jews who believed on him: Confuteth their vain Boa&s;t of being Abraham's Seed, and the Children of God: An&s;wereth their Reviling, by &s;hewing his Authority and Dignity; and, by Miracle, re&s;cueth him&s;elf from their Attempts to &s;tone him: He re&s;toreth to Sight, a Man that was born blind, who relateth to his Neighbours the Means of his Cure; and he is brought to the Phari&s;ees, who examine &s;trictly into the Fact, and are offended with his Acknowledgment of the divine Mi&s;&s;ion of the Author; they excommunicate him; he is received of <HI>JESUS,</HI> and confe&s;&s;eth him. <HI>CHRIST</HI> taxeth the Phari&s;ees with &s;piritual Blindne&s;s: He declareth him|&s;elf to be the Door, and the good Shepherd: Divers opinions concerning him. <HI>CHRIST</HI> re|proveth the fiery Zeal of James and John again&s;t the Samaritans, who would not receive him; and propo&s;eth Terms to three Per&s;ons, who offer to follow him: He &s;endeth out the &s;eventy Di&s;ciples, a &s;econd time, to work Miracles and to preach: He pronounceth a Woe again&s;t Chorazin, Beth&s;aida, and Capernaum: The &s;eventy return with joy; <HI>CHRIST</HI> &s;heweth them wherein to rejoice: He thanketh his Father for having revealed his Go&s;pel to the Simple only: He teacheth a Lawyer how to attain eternal Life; and, by the Parable of the good Samaritan, &s;heweth whom we are to con&s;ider as our Neighbour.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>JESUS having, by an amazing di&s;play of his wi&s;dom and penetration, defeated the malice, and mortified the pride of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, and they being &s;ent away a&s;hamed, under a full conviction that he knew the &s;ecrets of their hearts and lives; our Lord having, by his &s;uperior wi&s;dom, made u&s;e of their own con&s;ciences to defeat their cruel and villainous de&s;igns, he turned to the people, and with the utmo&s;t propriety declared, that he was <HI>the light of the world;</HI> that light which could penetrate through the darkne&s;s of the human heart, and di&s;cover and bring to light the dark de&s;igns and wicked devices of the &s;ons of men; that light which could pierce through the out&s;ide &s;hew of &s;anctity and holine&s;s, and di&s;cover the &s;ecret abominations of the mo&s;t proud and accompli&s;hed hypocrite; and that light which could di&s;cover the paths of darkne&s;s and error, and lead tho&s;e who are enabled to follow our Redeemer, in the road to eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and re&s;t. Hence, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour declared, 'I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, &s;hall not walk in darkne&s;s, but &s;hall have the light of life.' John viii.12.</P>
<P>SOME of the enemies of our Lord were among&s;t the people who heard this declara|tion, and they were &s;o highly provoked, that they told him, he mu&s;t be a deceiver be|cau&s;e he boa&s;ted of him&s;elf: <HI>Thou beare&s;t record of thy&s;elf,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>thy record is not true.</HI> To this, the great Saviour of &s;inners replied, that he did not call him&s;elf the light of the world, from a principle of pride and fal&s;ehood, but it was a title that ju&s;tly be|longed to him, which they would acknowledge, had they conceived true ideas of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom: but their carnal views had blinded their eyes, and corrupted, and depraved their judgments, &s;o that they did not know from what authority he had re|ceived his commi&s;&s;ion, nor whether he &s;hould return when he had executed it: <HI>Though I bear record of my&s;elf,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whi|ther I go: but ye cannot tell whence I came, and whither I go. Ye judge after the fle&s;h: I
<PB N="126" REF="029927_0130_0FE33725E4692EA8">
judge no man.</HI> Nor, added he, is there any truth or ju&s;tice in your remark, that I bear witne&s;s of my&s;elf, and have none to witne&s;s for me: for, let it be known, that my Father is with me; and joins me in what&s;oever I &s;ay or do: <HI>And yet if I judge,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that &s;ent me. It is al&s;o writ|ten in your law, that the te&s;timony of two men is true. I am one that bear witne&s;s of my&s;elf, and the Father that &s;ent me, beareth witne&s;s of me.</HI></P>
<P>THE Jews then inquired, where is thy Father, the other witne&s;s to whom thou ap|peale&s;t? To which our Lord replied, that their conduct and fooli&s;h inquiries, &s;ufficient|ly demon&s;trated, that they were &s;trangers, both to him and to his Father: for, had they known who he was, they would certainly have been at no lo&s;s to know who it was that he called his Father: had they known that he was the Me&s;&s;iah, they mu&s;t have under&s;tood that his Father was the great JEHOVAH, that all-wi&s;e and all-powerful Being, who was the great Maker, the all-wi&s;e and all-potent Pre&s;erver, the &s;upreme Governor, and King of the univer&s;e: <HI>Ye neither know me, nor my Father,</HI> &s;aid our great Redeemer; <HI>if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>THIS di&s;cour&s;e, the evangeli&s;t informs us, was held in the trea&s;ury, where the che&s;t was placed for receiving the offerings of all who came up to wor&s;hip in the temple, and mu&s;t, therefore, have been a place of great re&s;ort, being frequented by all &s;orts of people: but, notwith&s;tanding the public manner in which our Lord advanced his claim to the character of the Me&s;&s;iah, and the pride and rage of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, no man attempted to &s;eize him; Divine Providence did not permit them to put their cruel de&s;igns into execution, becau&s;e his hour, or the time of his &s;ufferings and death, was not yet come.</P>
<P>AFTER this di&s;cour&s;e was ended, JESUS repeated what he had before told them, de|claring that he &s;hould &s;hortly depart from them, and that then they &s;hould &s;eek him, and not be able to find him: <HI>I go my way,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and ye &s;hall &s;eek me, and &s;hall die in your &s;ins. Whither I go, ye cannot come.</HI> Perhaps, in the&s;e words, he might allude to the &s;tate of the Jewi&s;h nation after his death, and may be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ay, I &s;oon &s;hall depart from among&s;t you, and &s;uch mi&s;eries, and calamities, will over&s;pread the land, that you will be glad of a prophet to direct your conduct, and to pray for you: the Roman armies will &s;pread &s;uch deva&s;tation and horror over the face of your country, that you will then earne&s;tly wi&s;h for the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, in expectation of being delivered, by his power from your cruel enemy: but ye &s;hall then find your mi&s;take: ye &s;hall die in your &s;ins, and be for ever excluded the realms of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and re&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT the Jews were very far from under&s;tanding what he meant by going from them, they were &s;o fooli&s;h as to imagine, that he de&s;igned to put an end to his life, with his own hands; for they thought the only retreat where they could not find him, mu&s;t be the dark and &s;ilent chambers of the grave: <HI>Will he kill him&s;elf,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>becau&s;e he &s;aith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</HI> To this, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS replied, your ba&s;e in&s;inuation, betrays at once, the wickedne&s;s of your hearts, and the corruption and depravity of your natures: ye are from the earth, and are partakers of all the corruption and de|pravity con&s;equent on the fall of man; and from the evil pa&s;&s;ions which ari&s;e in your own wicked hearts, you form your conceptions of me; and, thinking me like your|&s;elves, conclude, that I can be capable of committing &s;o horrid a crime as &s;elf-murder: but you are mi&s;taken in me; my extraction, and my di&s;po&s;ition are very different from yours: I am not of this world; I am no partaker of the evils con&s;equent on &s;in; I have no propen&s;ity to corrupt and evil pa&s;&s;ions; my mind is not tainted with the
<PB N="127" REF="029927_0131_0FE3372D1A84A2A0">
corruption of human nature, the &s;ource of temptation, and the fountain of all evil: I came from above, and if you believe in me, you will find a remedy for tho&s;e evils which flow from the bitter fountain of the fall of man, and will be clean&s;ed from that pollution which flows from your earthly origin; but if ye &s;till continue in unbelief, <HI>ye &s;hall die in your &s;ins.</HI></P>
<P>THE Jews, in order to vindicate them&s;elves, inquired what &s;ort of a per&s;on he was, or who he pretended to be? To which our Lord replied, <HI>Even the &s;ame that I &s;aid unto you from the beginning;</HI> meaning <HI>the light of the world,</HI> which he had &s;tiled him&s;elf in the be|ginning of this di&s;cour&s;e: adding, <HI>I have many things to &s;ay and to judge of you: but he that &s;ent me is true; and I &s;pake to the world tho&s;e things which I have heard of him.</HI> However plain this di&s;cour&s;e may appear, it was not under&s;tood by the &s;tupid Jews; they did not perceive, <HI>that he &s;pake to them of the Father.</HI> But JESUS told them, that when they had crucified him, they would be convinced by the miracles attending that awful hour, his re&s;urrection from the dead, the de&s;cent of the Holy Spirit on his di&s;ciples, and the de&s;truction of the Jew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h nation, both who he was, and who the Father was, that &s;ent him: <HI>When ye have lifted up the Son of man,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>then &s;hall ye know that I am he, And that I do nothing of my&s;elf; but as my Father hath taught me, I &s;peak the&s;e things. And he that &s;ent me is with me; the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always tho&s;e things that plea&s;e him.</HI></P>
<P>AS he &s;pake the&s;e words, many of the Jews believed him to be the Me&s;&s;iah; per|haps, by his being lifted up, they did not under&s;tand his crucifixion, but his being exalted to the throne of David: but JESUS told them, if they per&s;evered in the belief of his word, they &s;hould really become his di&s;ciples, and being fully in&s;tructed in every doctrine of the go&s;pel, they &s;hould not only be freed from the &s;lavery of &s;in, but al&s;o from the ceremonial part of the law of Mo&s;es: <HI>If ye continue in my word,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>then are ye my di&s;ciples indeed; and ye &s;hall know the truth, and the truth &s;hall make you free.</HI></P>
<P>THE Jews, on hearing him declare, that they &s;hould be made free, ha&s;tily and warmly replied, <HI>We be Abraham's &s;eed, and were never in bondage to any man.</HI> This a&s;&s;ertion, if taken in a literal &s;en&s;e, was ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, the whole nation being, at that very time, in bondage to the Romans; nor were their ance&s;tors any &s;trangers to bondage and &s;la|very, having &s;everely felt the tyrannical yoke of the Egyptian, A&s;&s;yrian, and Babylon|i&s;h kings. It mu&s;t therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the expre&s;&s;ion was meant in a metapho|rical &s;en&s;e, and alluded to &s;piritual bondage: in this &s;en&s;e, it was a freedom in re&s;pect to religion which they a&s;&s;erted, and they meant, that they were the de&s;cendants of il|lu&s;trious ance&s;tors, who, in the wor&s;t of times, had pre&s;erved &s;entiments in religion and government worthy the po&s;terity of Abraham; nor had the hotte&s;t per&s;ecution of the A&s;&s;yrian kings, been able to compel them to embrace the religion of the Heathens; in re&s;pect to truth, they were never in bondage to any man, and they a&s;ked our Re|deemer, <HI>How &s;aye&s;t thou, ye &s;hall be made free?</HI></P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, JESUS replied, that they who gave them&s;elves up to a vicious cour&s;e of life, and to the gratification of their &s;en&s;ual appetites, were the wor&s;t of &s;laves, and it was highly nece&s;&s;ary for them to con&s;ider whether this character did not belong to them&s;elves: <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>who&s;oever committeth &s;in, is the &s;ervant of &s;in.</HI> And, as a &s;lave connot be a&s;&s;ured of the continuance of his ma&s;|ter's favour, nor of abiding in his hou&s;e continually, &s;o our great Redeemer ob&s;erved, that his Father might ju&s;tly, for their &s;ins, deprive them of the external privileges
<PB N="128" REF="029927_0132_0FE3373043906A20">
which they had &s;o gro&s;sly abu&s;ed: as their &s;ins had rendered them bond-&s;laves to Di|vine ju&s;tice, they might expect to fall under the &s;evere&s;t marks of his di&s;plea&s;ure, ex|cept they prevented the dreadful evils, con&s;equent on their wickedne&s;s, by believing on his Son, and receiving him, who alone was able to make them free indeed, and place them in the heavenly Jeru&s;alem. Our Lord then proceeded to inform them, that though, in a natural &s;en&s;e, they were the &s;eed of Abraham; yet, in a moral &s;en&s;e, they were the offspring of Satan, which was fully manife&s;ted by their unju&s;t, and cruel de|&s;ign to de&s;troy their great deliverer: <HI>I know,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that ye are Abraham's &s;eed; but ye &s;eek to kill me, becau&s;e my word hath no place in you. I &s;peak that which I have &s;een with my Father: and ye do that which you have &s;een with your father.</HI> To this the Jews ha&s;tily and angrily replied, <HI>Abraham is our father:</HI> but our Redeemer informed them, that it appeared from their conduct, that they were of another original: <HI>If,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye &s;eek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord having declared to the Jews, that it was manife&s;t from their deeds, and their wicked inclinations, who&s;e children they were; they, willing to ju&s;tify them&s;elves, replied with &s;ome warmth: <HI>We be not born of fornication: we have one Father, even God.</HI> By the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, the Jews did not mean a natural, but a &s;piritual lineage, and by their not being born of fornication, their being free from idolatry, which, in the language of the prophets, is repre&s;ented as fornication and adultery: they were not idolaters them&s;elves, nor born of idolatrous parents, and therefore, they &s;tyled them|&s;elves the children of God. But JESUS gave them to under&s;tand, that if they were the children of God, they would manife&s;t their relation by their love to his Son: <HI>If God were your Father,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>ye would love me: for I proceedeth forth and came from God; neither came I of my&s;elf, but he &s;ent me:</HI> but ye, continued our great Redeemer, are of your father the devil; ye appear in his likene&s;s, and continue to gratify the evil incli|nations, and diabolical pa&s;&s;ions, which ye have learnt of him, and derived from him; fal&s;ehood, pride, and cruelty, are the pa&s;&s;ions which he con&s;tantly in&s;pires, and the&s;e are abundantly manife&s;ted in your temper and conduct; he delights in murder and blood, and you are plotting again&s;t the life of the innocent; fal&s;ehood and lies are na|tural to him, and he never &s;peaketh the truth, but to put off &s;ome lie which he hath joined to it: <HI>Ye are,</HI> &s;aid the exalted Saviour of &s;inners, <HI>of your father the Devil, and the lu&s;ts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, becau&s;e their is no truth in him. When he &s;peaketh a lie, he &s;peaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it. And becau&s;e I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord then publicly challenged all his enemies, to prove him guilty of any fal&s;ehood: <HI>Which of you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>convicteth me of &s;in?</HI> Are any of you able to &s;hew that I have done any thing which renders me unworthy of belief? Can you prove that I have taught fal&s;e doctrine? Have I reproved you unju&s;tly for your actions? Have I charged you with crimes you were not guilty of? And can any of you prove me guilty of any &s;inful action, or prove any part of my conduct to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the cha|racter I have a&s;&s;umed? If none of you can do this, but mu&s;t confe&s;s that my doctrine and life are &s;uch as might be expected from a me&s;&s;enger &s;ent from God; <HI>Why do ye not believe me?</HI> But the rea&s;on is plain, you do not belong to God, ye have no intere&s;t in his favour, nor are partakers of his grace: <HI>He that is of God, heareth God's words; ye therefore hear them not, becau&s;e ye are not of God.</HI></P>
<P>THIS declaration exa&s;perated and enraged the Jews to the highe&s;t pitch, and with a mixture of di&s;dain and contempt, they replied, <HI>Say we not well, that thou art a Samaritan,
<PB N="129" REF="029927_0133_0FE33731C885F9F0">
and ha&s;t a devil?</HI> His calling the de&s;cendants of Abraham the children of the De|vil, they thought was a &s;ufficient proof, that either he mu&s;t be a profligate wretch, which they meant by calling him a Samaritan, or el&s;e mu&s;t be in&s;tigated by &s;ome evil &s;pirit. But JESUS replied, that he was not under the dominion of any evil &s;pirit, but &s;poke the words of eternal truth; he was not in league with hell, nor in alliance with the prince of darkne&s;s: on the contrary, he honoured his Father, by &s;peaking the words of truth, which he &s;ent him to deliver: <HI>I have not a devil,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>but I honour my Father, and ye do di&s;honour me, and I &s;eek not mine own glory; there is one that &s;eeketh and judgeth.</HI> Our great Redeemer, by the&s;e words, gave them to under&s;tand, that he did not court their applau&s;e, or fear their reproaches: for there was one concerned, that was able to vindicate his honour, and &s;everely puni&s;h all who &s;hould dare to attack him with unju&s;t and malignant reproaches.</P>
<P>OUR great Redeemer, having vindicated his character, proceeded to make a declara|tion, which very much &s;urpri&s;ed the Jews with whom he was conver&s;ing, <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>if a man keep my words, he &s;hall never &s;ee death.</HI> The Jews, thinking the&s;e words had reference to a natural death, cried out with an air of triumph&punc; <HI>Now we know that thou ha&s;t a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets: and thou &s;aye&s;t, if a man keep my &s;aying, he &s;hall never ta&s;te of death. Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? And the prophets are dead; whom make&s;t thou thy&s;elf?</HI> John viii.52, 53. To this our great Redeemer replied, that as they had lately objected to the te&s;timony which he bare of him&s;elf, he &s;hould not re&s;t the cau&s;e on that foundation, but refer it to his Father, whom they acknowledged to be the &s;upreme Lord of heaven and earth: but, though they pretended to wor&s;hip the true God, they were totally ignorant of him; they neither formed ju&s;t conceptions of him, nor wor&s;hipped him in the manner they ought; they were not the per&s;ons by whom he required to be wor|&s;hipped, and whom he always accepted: on the contrary, JESUS declared, that he formed ju&s;t ideas of God, and obeyed his precepts; if he was to &s;ay he did not know him, he would be a liar, like the Jews with whom he was conver&s;ing. And as to the patriarch Abraham, of whom they boa&s;ted &s;o much, he earne&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;ee the day of the Me&s;&s;iah, and had &s;o much of it revealed to him, as filled his heart with glad|ne&s;s: <HI>If I honour my&s;elf,</HI> &s;aid our great Redeemer, <HI>my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye &s;ay, he is your God, yet ye have not known him, but I know him; and if I &s;hould &s;ay, I know him not, I &s;hould be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his &s;aying. Your father Abraham rejoiced,</HI> or de&s;ired, <HI>to &s;ee my days; and he &s;aw it, and was glad.</HI></P>
<P>THE Jews under&s;tanding the&s;e words in a natural &s;en&s;e, concluded that he affirmed, that he was before Abraham, and knowing that he was under fifty years old, they con|&s;idered this declaration as ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, and highly ridiculous. They had no conception of his divine nature, though he had &s;o often told them he was the Son of God, and, of con&s;equence, exi&s;ted with the Father before the commencement of time. This gro&s;s &s;tupidity and perver&s;ene&s;s, induced our great Redeemer to a&s;&s;ert his dignity in the plaine&s;t terms; <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, before Abraham was, I am.</HI> This de|claration &s;o enraged the Jews, that they ru&s;hed upon him with the utmo&s;t violence and fury; and, as nothing le&s;s than his immediate death would &s;atisfy them, they took up &s;tones to &s;tone him: but JESUS, either rendering him&s;elf invi&s;ible, or filling the minds of his enemies with confu&s;ion, and ab&s;ence of thought, pa&s;&s;ed immediately and imper|ceptibly through the crowd, and departed out of the temple.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="029927_0134_0FE337334B7793D0">WHILE JESUS remained in Jeru&s;alem, he &s;aw in one of the &s;treets of the city, a man who had been blind from his birth: the &s;ight of &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed an object, &s;oon excited the compa&s;&s;ion of the kind and benevolent Saviour of &s;inners; the various affronts and indignities which he had &s;o lately received from the Jews, could not prevent him from the exertion of his omnipotence in favour of &s;uch objects as the&s;e, though they be|longed to that cruel, malicious, and unbelieving nation; he was not to be provoked by their crimes, &s;o far as to withhold his ble&s;&s;ings from them. Accordingly, he be|held this poor blind man, not with a &s;hort and carele&s;s view, but with a &s;teady and fixed attention; he ca&s;t on him the eyes of his divine compa&s;&s;ion, and determined to afford him unexpected relief.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples, remarking their Lord's attention to this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, helple&s;s per&s;on, and, doubtle&s;s, imagining that as he had engaged the pity of the only per&s;on who was able to help him, he would &s;oon, by divine power and goodne&s;s, be re&s;tored to &s;ight, a&s;ked their Ma&s;ter, what was the cau&s;e of his blindne&s;s: and they were the more &s;oli|citous to be &s;atisfied in this matter, as the di&s;order had commenced before his birth: they had learned from the law, that &s;in was the cau&s;e of affliction and bodily di&s;temper, and that the Lord vi&s;its the iniquities of the fathers upon their children; and there|fore, they inquired of their Ma&s;ter, who did &s;in, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? To this que&s;tion, our Lord replied, that this di&s;order was not the imme|diate con&s;equence of the man's own &s;in, nor that of his parents, but that he was born blind, that the works of God &s;hould be made manife&s;t in him.</P>
<P>BY this reply, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour has taught us, that a curious inquiry into the cau&s;e of tho&s;e afflictions and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of particular per&s;ons, which &s;eem very extraordinary, and are peculiarly affecting, and unaccountably deplorable, is impertinent and vain; and our cen&s;ure of &s;uch per&s;ons as the greate&s;t of &s;inners, and bringing down re|markable vengeance from heaven on their wickedne&s;s, is cruel and unju&s;t; the de&s;igns of the great Governor of the univer&s;e are not open to our view; he is perfectly and immutably wi&s;e; we are full of blindne&s;s and folly; he knows how to an&s;wer the ends of his own government, and accompli&s;h the de&s;igns of his grace, by the afflictions and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which he &s;ometimes permits to fall upon his own people: while the narrow|ne&s;s of our hearts, and our fooli&s;h pride and vanity, are prone to a&s;cribe tho&s;e afflic|tions to a man's own per&s;onal vices, which are for the glory of God, and intended to work out the &s;uperior good of the &s;uffering per&s;on, or &s;ome way or other to promote the real advantage of mankind.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour having declared the cau&s;e of this man's blindne&s;s, namely, that the works of God &s;hould be made manife&s;t in him, further declared, I mu&s;t work the work of him that &s;ent me, while it is day; the night cometh, when no man can work: declaring to his di&s;ciples, and all the world, his unwearied labour, and cea&s;ele&s;s atten|tion and care in the work of his Almighty Father; in this he laboured ince&s;&s;antly, both day and night, during the time of his &s;ojourning in the fle&s;h; to this only he directed his thoughts, with unwearied ardour, and unremitting diligence: this he e&s;teemed even as his meat and drink, and &s;uffered the neglect of his ordinary food, that he might fini&s;h the great work which he came into the world to accompli&s;h, and bring about the &s;alvation of lo&s;t peri&s;hing &s;inners: to accompli&s;h this he left that glory which he had with his Father in the highe&s;t heavens, came down into a world of labour and &s;or|row, and went about doing good.</P>
<P>AS it was now the Sabbath-day, and our Lord was about to perform an act of mercy and benevolence, which required &s;ome little labour, it appears, that the above declara|tion
<PB REF="029927_0135_0FE3373A7ADB6DB8">

<PB N="131" REF="029927_0136_0FE3373DB351D528">
had &s;ome reference to this, and &s;eems to intimate, that, as his time for &s;uch acts of mercy was now &s;o very &s;hort, it was not proper to defer it till the day of re&s;t was over.</P>
<P>BUT before our Saviour p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oceeded to the miracle of re&s;toring &s;ight to the man who was born blind, he took occa&s;ion to &s;peak of him&s;elf, as a per&s;on appointed to illuminate the minds of men, which lay involved in darkne&s;s, more deplorable than that which &s;o many years had beclouded the poor object before him: <HI>As long as I am in the world,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I am the light of the world.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE it may be ob&s;erved, that the miracles wrought by our great Redeemer, were not only plain proofs of his mi&s;&s;ion, and full evidences of his being the Me&s;&s;iah, but had a reference to the &s;piritual nature of his kingdom, and were emblems of the various parts of his divine character, and victorious deeds. Thus, his miraculou&s;ly feeding the multitudes with common bread, was a plain indication, that he came into the world to &s;eed the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lievers in his name with the bread of life, that all-nouri&s;hing food for the &s;oul. His re&s;toring &s;ight to the blind, was a lively emblem of the tendency of his doc|trine, and efficacy of his power, to di&s;pel the darkne&s;s of the &s;oul, and illuminate the blinded under&s;tanding of men. His healing their bodies, repre&s;ented his power to heal the &s;oul, and was an evidence of his authority to forgive &s;ins, as all bodily di&s;or|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs are the con&s;equences of &s;in; and a removal of the puni&s;hment, &s;trongly implied a power equal to the removal of the guilt. His ca&s;ting out devils, was an earne&s;t of his final victory over the prince of darkne&s;s, and his future triumph over all the powers of hell. His rai&s;ing particular per&s;ons from the dead, was the beginning of his triumph over death, and a demon&s;tration of his ability to accompli&s;h a general re&s;urrection. And finally, his curing all promi&s;cuou&s;ly, who applied to him, &s;hewed that he was the friend of &s;inners, and that none who came to him would be rejected, let their &s;ins be ever &s;o numerous, or their ca&s;e ever &s;o deplorable. Such are the &s;piritual truths which may be collected from the miracles of the Son of God; and accordingly, we find, that this exalted per&s;on him&s;elf, at, or &s;oon after the performing his miracles, while the great events were fre&s;h on the memory, often turned his di&s;cour&s;e to the &s;piritual things they repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour having declared, that he was the light of the world, <HI>he &s;pit on the ground, and made clay of the &s;pittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, and &s;aid unto him, Go wa&s;h in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, &s;ent.) He went his way therefore, and wa&s;hed, and came &s;eeing.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is no doubt but our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, could have performed this miracle with|out any external means; indeed the means he u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, were &s;o far from being likely to effect the cure, that they &s;eemed calculated to produce a contrary effect. We mu&s;t therefore conclude, that the&s;e means were de&s;igned, to direct our attention to higher my&s;teries, and &s;hew us, that it can be no other power than that which fir&s;t created man out of clay, that enlightens the dark mind of the dead &s;inner, and gives &s;piritual light to tho&s;e eyes, which are clo&s;ed by the thick darkne&s;s of guilt.</P>
<P>WHETHER the blind man, who&s;e ca&s;e we are now con&s;idering, was acquainted with the name and character of our Redeemer, the evangeli&s;ts have not informed us: but as his miracles had been publi&s;hed in Jeru&s;alem &s;o often, as well as in all the country round, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that this man, who re&s;ided at Jeru&s;alem, could be totally ignorant of them; and it &s;eems, by his ready obedience to the directions of the Son of God, though the means directed, &s;eemed to have no tendency to promote the cure, that
<PB N="132" REF="029927_0137_0FE3373F39C35E68">
he knew who it was that gave him tho&s;e directions: and we find, that he was amply rewarded for the readine&s;s of his obedience, by receiving the gift of &s;ight.</P>
<P>SO wonderful an event, could not fail of engaging the attention, and exciting the &s;urpri&s;e of all that beheld it; and tho&s;e who had often &s;een the blind man in his dark and deplorable condition, it may be expected, would be very particular in their inquiries into the means of &s;o &s;ingular, and &s;urpri&s;ing an event: it was, doubtle&s;s, the &s;ubject of general conver&s;ation: and one would have thought, it might have been the cau&s;e of general conver&s;ation; but the ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s of the Jewi&s;h nation, was not to be overcome; their unbelief and hardne&s;s of heart, would not give way to the cleare&s;t evidence. Great was the &s;urpri&s;e of the neighbours, and friends, of the re&s;tor|ed per&s;on: They which before had &s;een him, that he was blind, &s;aid, is not this he that &s;at and begged? Some &s;aid, this is he; others &s;aid, it is like him; but he &s;aid, I am he.</P>
<P>THE poor man's heart was full of gratitude and joy, and therefore, perceiving his neighbours to doubt the identity of his per&s;on, he proclaimed him&s;elf to be the very &s;ame whom they had lately &s;een begging in total darkne&s;s; I am he, thus wonderfully ble&s;&s;ed with &s;ight by the mighty power of God, &s;aid he; I am the man who was blind from my birth, whom ye have all &s;een, and many of you have relieved me in my de|plorable di&s;tre&s;s; I am he who was even, from my mothers womb, involved in pitchy darkne&s;s, but now with joy and wonder, which I cannot expre&s;s, behold the beauteous beams of day.</P>
<P>ON hearing &s;o frank and full a declaration, they were anxious to know how this great event was produced; and they ha&s;tily inquired, How were thine eyes opened? To which the man replied, a man, that is called JESUS, made clay, an anointed mine eyes, and &s;aid unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wa&s;h: and I went and wa&s;hed, and I received &s;ight. They then a&s;ked him where the per&s;on was who had performed &s;o wonderful, merciful, and beneficial a work? To which the man replied, <HI>I know not:</HI> for JESUS had retired while the man went to wa&s;h in the pool of Siloam; perhaps our Lord cho&s;e to retire, to avoid the applau&s;e of the people, which would naturally fol|low &s;o &s;tupendous a work, and which, we frequently find in the go&s;pels, he was parti|cularly careful to &s;hun.</P>
<P>THE per&s;ons who were witne&s;&s;es of this wonderful event, either out of envy again&s;t JESUS, or being de&s;irous to &s;earch the affair to the bottom, brought the man who was the &s;ubject of this miracle, before the council, as proper judges of the matter: accor|dingly, as &s;oon as he was placed before the a&s;&s;embly, the Phari&s;ees began, in a brow|beating way, to que&s;tion him how he recovered his &s;ight? However awful and terrible &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly might be to a poor beggar, the man boldly mentioned the name of JESUS, and po&s;itively declared&mdash;He put clay upon mine eyes, and I wa&s;hed, and do &s;ee. The Phari&s;ees, having heard this account of the miracle, maliciou&s;ly declared, that the per&s;on who had performed it, was a deceiver: for, if he was a prophet, he would be an ob&s;erver of the law, which he had openly violated, by working this work on the Sabbath-day. But &s;ome in the council, with a &s;pirit of greater candour and modera|tion, gave it as their opinion, that no deceiver could work &s;o great and beneficial a work; for no wicked man would have either inclination or power to perform it.</P>
<P>THE court, being thus divided in their opinion with regard to the character of JESUS, they a&s;ked the man, what he thought of the per&s;on who had re&s;tored him to fight? To which he boldly and plainly replied, <HI>He is a prophet.</HI> But the Jews, &s;till
<PB N="133" REF="029927_0138_0FE33740C12DAA90">
hoped to invalidate the miracle, and therefore in&s;inuated, that it was not true, that this man was really born blind: to come to the bottom of this matter, they &s;ent for his parents, and a&s;ked them, whether he was their &s;on, and if he really was born blind, and by what means he had received his &s;ight? To which they an&s;wered, that he was mo&s;t certainly their &s;on, and was born blind; but by what means he had received his &s;ight, or what per&s;on had conferred this great ble&s;&s;ing upon him, they could not tell: but, as their &s;on was of age to an&s;wer for him&s;elf, they referred them to him: <HI>The&s;e words &s;pake his parents, becau&s;e they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man &s;hould confe&s;s that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t, he &s;hould be put out of the Syna|gogue.</HI></P>
<P>IN the conduct of the parents of this poor man, we may behold the great evil of the fear of man, and how powerfully this &s;lavi&s;h principle acts on the mind; they well knew by what means their &s;on had received his &s;ight; and, like him, they &s;hould, with grati|tude and joy, have confe&s;&s;ed the divine hand which had wrought this wonderful work; and dared to have acknowledged this extraordinary per&s;on before all the world, whatever the con&s;equences of &s;uch conduct might have been. Let us hence learn the weakne&s;s of human nature, and never pre&s;ume too much on our own &s;trength, but implore the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Holy Spirit at all times, and not love the prai&s;e of men more than the Favour of God.</P>
<P>THE Phari&s;ees, finding all their attempts to di&s;approve or le&s;&s;en this miracle, did but tend to e&s;tabli&s;h the matter of fact, and make it &s;hine with greater lu&s;tre, proceeded to their old method of calumniating the divine author of it: <HI>They called again the man that had been born blind, and &s;aid unto him, Give God the prai&s;e: we know that this man is a &s;inner.</HI> To which the man an&s;wered, <HI>Whether he be a &s;inner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I &s;ee.</HI></P>
<P>THIS an&s;wer was not &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the proud and envious oppo&s;ers of the Son of God, but they &s;ought to confound the poor man, who had thus plainly and boldly affirmed the truth re&s;pecting a matter of fact, in which it was impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be mi&s;taken, with a multiplicity of que&s;tions, and would meanly lead a poor &s;imple beggar into all the windings of &s;ophi&s;try; and with this view a&s;ked him 'What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes?' The&s;e que&s;tions they had a&s;ked before, and received plain and po&s;itive an&s;wers to each: but they &s;eemed now to repeat them with a de&s;ign, that the man, by repeating the manner in which he received the cure, might be &s;en&s;ible that JESUS had, by effecting this miracle, violated the Sabbath, and mu&s;t, of con&s;equence, be an im|po&s;ter. Thus the enemies of our Redeemer would have per&s;uaded the per&s;on who had received the invaluable ble&s;&s;ing of &s;ight, to join with them in the judgment they formed of the great per&s;on who had been his generous benefactor: but their ob&s;tinacy and per|ver&s;ene&s;s appeared &s;o plain to him, that he boldly an&s;wered, <HI>I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? Will ye al&s;o be his di&s;ciples?</HI></P>
<P>THIS an&s;wer was received by the council with indignation, &s;corn, and contempt; for <HI>they reviled him, and &s;aid, thou art his di&s;ciple, but we are Mo&s;es's di&s;ciples. We know that God &s;pake unto Mo&s;es: as for this follow, ye know not whence he is.</HI> The poor beggar was &s;ur|pri&s;ed, that &s;o extraordinary a per&s;on, and one who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch wonderful powers, and exerted them for the good of mankind, &s;hould be unknown to the rulers of I&s;rael, <HI>Why herein is a marvellous thing,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that ye know not whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes: we know that God heareth not &s;inners; but if a man be a wor&s;hipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. Since the world began, it was not heard, that any man opened the eyes, of one that was born blind. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="029927_0139_0FE3374B9525AA70">SUCH was the plain and powerful rea&s;oning of this poor man; his inference was ju&s;t and natural, and founded on a plain matter of fact, and principles which could not be denied: they all knew, nor dur&s;t they deny, that <HI>God heareth not &s;inners</HI>: they all knew, that God had heard JESUS; the miracle which he had ju&s;t now wrought, and which could not be denied, plainly proved this; for it was a miracle which never had been performed by any man &s;ince the beginning of the world: it was far above the reach of the powers of nature, or the attainments of human art; and, therefore, its origin mu&s;t be truly divine. It therefore undeniably followed, that JESUS was not a &s;inner, but &s;ent from God, otherwi&s;e he could do nothing.</P>
<P>THE Phari&s;ees were not ignorant, that this argument was conclu&s;ive; they felt its whole force, and well knew that it could not be re&s;i&s;ted; accordingly, they did not attempt to an&s;wer it, but had recour&s;e to puni&s;hment, and abu&s;ive language: <HI>Thou wa&s;t altogether born in &s;ins, and do&s;t thou teach us,</HI> &s;aid they: th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> impudent illiterate mortal, who&s;e under&s;tanding is as dark as thy body lately was, do&s;t thou pre&s;ume to judge and determine, and di&s;&s;ent in opinion from the wi&s;e and learned! Thou, who wa&s;t born under the heavie&s;t puni&s;hment of &s;ins, do&s;t thou pretend to in&s;truct the rulers of the people, who are eminent for their knowledge of the law! Having thus vented their pride and envy, in reviling the poor man, the evangeli&s;t adds, <HI>they ca&s;t him out:</HI> that is, they pa&s;&s;ed on him the &s;entence of excommunication, which is the highe&s;t puni&s;h|ment it was in their power to inflict: but, though he was cut off from the Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue and &s;ociety, he was received into a &s;ociety, who&s;e privileges are great, and from which he could never be excluded by any unju&s;t &s;entence, by any body of men, however powerful: he was united to a &s;ociety who&s;e members are never cut off, but will unite in happine&s;s, love, joy, and glory, during a boundle&s;s eternity.</P>
<P>THAT this poor man was received among&s;t the number of the di&s;ciples of CHRIST, is manife&s;t from the conver&s;ation which &s;oon after pa&s;&s;ed between the re&s;tored per&s;on and our great Redeemer: <HI>Je&s;us heard that they had ca&s;t him out; and when he had found him, he &s;aid unto him, Do&s;t thou believe in the Son of God.</HI></P>
<P>THE man did not know how to an&s;wer this que&s;tion, till he knew who was the great per&s;on which JESUS had mentioned to him; and therefore, he inquired, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? Our great Redeemer would not keep him in &s;u&s;pence, but immediately and explicitly replied, <HI>Thou ha&s;t both &s;een him, and it is he who talketh with thee.</HI> The poor man an&s;wered, with gratitude and joy, <HI>Lord I believe; and he wor&s;hipped him.</HI> Our Lord graciou&s;ly accepted of his adoration, and glancing at the pride, and perver&s;ene&s;s of the Phari&s;ees, he &s;aid, <HI>For judgment I am come into this world, that they which &s;ee not, might &s;ee; and that they which &s;ee, might be made blind.</HI> Some of the Phari&s;ees, which were with him, heard the&s;e words, and perceiving the reference to them&s;elves, they a&s;ked, are we blind al&s;o? To which our Lord replied, If ye were blind, ye &s;hould have no &s;in: but now ye &s;ay, we &s;ee, therefore your &s;in re|maineth.</P>
<P>OUR Lord then, to &s;hew the di&s;parity between him&s;elf, and tho&s;e proud, hypocriti|cal teachers, a&s;&s;umed the character of a &s;hepherd, and di&s;played his love, tenderne&s;s, and care for his cho&s;en followers, by the &s;imilitude of the care and watchfulne&s;s of a good &s;hepherd over his flock, while &s;uch fal&s;e pretenders, and hypocritical teachers as the Phari&s;ees, might fitly be compared to a gang of thieves, who&s;e only view is to di&s;turb and de&s;troy: <HI>The thief cometh not, but for to &s;teal, and to kill, and to de&s;troy: I am come that the &s;heep might have life, and they might have it more abundantly. I am the good &s;hepherd: the good &s;hepherd giveth his life for the &s;heep.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="029927_0140_0FE3374DF1DC09C0">AND further to &s;hew the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of believing in him, and receiving his doctrine, our great Redeemer compared him&s;elf to a door; <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, I am the door of the &s;heep. All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers. He that entereth not by the door into the &s;heep-fold, but climbeth up &s;ome other way, the &s;ame is a thief, and a robber.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH the&s;e &s;imilitudes contained a very &s;evere reproof, directed to the fal&s;e teachers of I&s;rael, they did not under&s;tand the meaning of them, and the people were much divided in their &s;entiments concerning him and his teaching; &s;ome &s;aid, <HI>He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? Others &s;aid, The&s;e are not the words of one that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</HI></P>
<P>FROM the pride, envy, ob&s;tinate perver&s;ene&s;s, and implacable re&s;entment of the Pha|ri&s;ees, we &s;hould learn to contemplate the crafty in&s;inuation, and &s;ubtle endeavours of the enemies of the cro&s;s of CHRIST in the&s;e latter times: nor need we be &s;urpri&s;ed, if we find the &s;ame malicious in&s;inuations in different &s;hapes levelled again&s;t our&s;elves, if we are enabled to embrace the truths of the go&s;pel, and to confe&s;s before all men the glory, honour and dignity of him who hath opened our eyes, and brought us <HI>out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light.</HI> It is contrary to the nature of the world, or worldly minded men, to love our Lord JESUS CHRIST, or to e&s;teem tho&s;e who profe&s;s to know him, and bear witne&s;s concerning the world, that its works are evil. Let us not, there|fore, be di&s;couraged if we find the world to hate us, and load us with unju&s;t reproaches for our attachment to the cau&s;e of our great Redeemer; but, like the blind man, who&s;e ca&s;e we have been con&s;idering, let us openly and boldly profe&s;s the truth, and declare the power of God, who hath illuminated our dark minds, and led us in the paths of everla&s;ting light and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE fea&s;t of dedication now drew near, and our Lord prepared to go to Jeru&s;alem, to be pre&s;ent at the &s;olemnity. This fea&s;t was not appointed by Mo&s;es, but by that no|ble warrior, and heroic reformer, Judas Maccabeus, in commemoration of his having clean&s;ed the temple, and re&s;tored its wor&s;hip, after both had been prophaned and pol|luted by that abominable tyrant Antiochus Epiphanes.</P>
<P>BUT, though this fea&s;t was of human in&s;titution, our Lord cho&s;e to be pre&s;ent at it, although he knew that fre&s;h attempts would be made again&s;t his life; his time on earth he knew was &s;hort, his public mini&s;try was drawing to a period, and, therefore, he would not omit any opportunity of preaching to the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and doing good to the children of men; nor did he now, as he had formerly done, travel in private, but openly declared his intention of going to Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>THE road to the capital from Galilee, to which our Lord had retired after the mi|racle of re&s;toring &s;ight to the blind man, lay through Samaria. The inhabitants of this country entertained the mo&s;t inveterate hatred again&s;t all who wor&s;hipped in the temple at Jeru&s;alem: JESUS was no &s;tranger to this di&s;po&s;ition of the Samaritans, and therefore he &s;ent me&s;&s;engers before him, that they might find reception for him in one of the villages: but the Samaritans being informed, that the intention of his journey was to wor&s;hip at the temple in Jeru&s;alem, they &s;uffered their old national pre|judice to prevail &s;o far, as to induce them to refu&s;e him admittance.</P>
<P>THE me&s;&s;engers who had been &s;ent on this bu&s;ine&s;s returned, and gave an account of the inho&s;pitable treatment they had received; which &s;o exceedingly offended the di&s;ciples, that they prevailed on James and John, to propo&s;e to their Ma&s;ter the calling

down fire from heaven to de&s;troy them, pleading the example of the prophet Elijah for &s;uch precipitate and violent proceedings: <HI>Lord, wilt thou,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>that we command fire to come down from heaven, and con&s;ume them, even as Elias did?</HI></P>
<P>BUT the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, who&s;e meekne&s;s on all occa&s;ions was beyond example, re|buked them for entertaining &s;o ha&s;ty and unbecoming a re&s;entment: <HI>Ye know not,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>what manner of &s;pirit ye are of</HI>: ye are ignorant of the &s;infulne&s;s of the di&s;po&s;ition which ye have now expre&s;&s;ed, nor do ye con&s;ider the difference between the di&s;pen&s;a|tion of the law and the go&s;pel: the &s;everity of the prophet Elijah was a ju&s;t puni&s;h|ment to a wicked and cruel, as well as idolatrous king, and a people who had con&s;ent|ed to his crimes, and had for&s;aken the wor&s;hip of the God of their fathers; it was a puni&s;hment very proper for the times, and what the nature of the offence required; it was con&s;i&s;tent with the character of the prophet, and not un&s;uitable to the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation: but the go&s;pel breathed a very different &s;pirit; the de&s;ign of our Re|deemer's coming into the world, not being to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them.</P>
<P>BEHOLD here, ye de&s;pi&s;ers of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation! Ye advocates for the purity and dignity of human nature, and de&s;pi&s;ers of the cro&s;s of CHRIST! Behold here an in&s;tance of patience under an unprovoked injury, which cannot be matched among&s;t all the boa&s;ted heroes of antiquity; an in&s;tance of patience which expre&s;&s;ed infinite &s;weet|ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, worthy to be imitated by all the human race, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who call them&s;elves the di&s;ciples of CHRIST.</P>
<P>ENTERTAINMENT and reception being denied by the inho&s;pitable inhabitants of this Samaritan village, our great Redeemer, with his di&s;ciples, directed their way towards another; and as they were on the way, he was met by a &s;tranger, and acco&s;ted with this language, <HI>Lord, I will follow thee whither&s;oever thou goe&s;t.</HI> The ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, to whom the hearts of all mankind were open, well knowing that it was only the riches and honours, of the Me&s;&s;iah's expected temporal kingdom, which excited this per&s;on to make the declaration; he thought proper at fir&s;t to undeceive him: <HI>Foxes have holes,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and the birds of the air have ne&s;ts; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head;</HI> alluding to the conduct of the inho&s;pitable Samaritans, and foretelling what they mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer, who e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e, and joined the train of our great Re|deemer.</P>
<P>SOON after, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour met with one who had formerly been his di&s;ciple, and commanded him to di&s;engage him&s;elf from worldly concerns, and to join in his train; but this per&s;on excu&s;ed him&s;elf, under pretence of filial piety, and a de&s;ire to attend on, and admini&s;ter relief, to his aged parents: <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;uffer me fir&s;t to go and bury my Father:</HI> but our great Redeemer replied, <HI>Let the dead bury their dead; but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</HI> Let tho&s;e who are immer&s;ed in worldly affairs, follow the concerns of the world, but let tho&s;e who have received the great truths of the go&s;pel, and made a profe&s;&s;ion of our Redeemer's name, do every thing in their power to &s;pread the glad-tidings of &s;alvation over the whole earth.</P>
<P>A third per&s;on propo&s;ed to follow our Lord, but de&s;ired liberty to return to his hou&s;e, and take his leave of the family: but, though our Lord would not by any means di&s;|courage prudent care in the dome&s;tic affairs of life, yet he gave this per&s;on to under&s;tand, that the &s;alvation of the &s;oul was the principal concern, and required our fir&s;t, and chief regard; and we &s;hould by no means, let the concerns of time, and &s;en&s;e, have &s;uch an influence on our minds, as to make us lo&s;e &s;ight of this great object. Great is the

danger of coldne&s;s and declen&s;ion in our &s;piritual affairs; for our Lord him&s;elf declar|ed, in an&s;wer to this per&s;on's objection: 'No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.'</P>
<P>AS our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's mini&s;try was from this time till its final period, to be con|fined to Judea, and the countries beyond Jordan, it was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome me&s;&s;engers &s;hould be &s;ent to every town and village, to prepare his way: accordingly, he called his &s;eventy di&s;ciples, and gave them proper in&s;tructions concerning their behaviour, and the doctrines they were to preach. Having laid before them the particular duties of their mi&s;&s;ion, he &s;ent them into different parts of the country, and ordered them to vi&s;it tho&s;e particular cities, towns, or villages, where he intended him&s;elf to follow them, and preach the doctrine of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel to the inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on which our great Redeemer a&s;&s;igned for &s;ending the&s;e &s;eventy di&s;ciples on this important me&s;&s;age, was the &s;ame which he had before advanced for the mi&s;&s;ion of the twelve: <HI>The harve&s;t truly is great, but the labourers are few.</HI> And being never more to preach in Chorazin, Beth&s;aida, and Capernaum, the cities wherein he u&s;ually re&s;ided, and where he had &s;o often delivered his heavenly di&s;cour&s;es, and di&s;played his mira|culous power, and divine benevolence, in many wonderous works, he was naturally led to reflect on the reception which him&s;elf and his doctrines had met with, from tho&s;e wicked, impenitent cities. He was &s;en&s;ible of the terrible evils which would flow from rejecting the Son of God, and per&s;i&s;ting in the ob&s;tinacy of unbelief, notwith&s;tanding the mighty works, which they had &s;een, and all the opportunities which they had for in&s;truction and improvement; and though he was grieved for their ob&s;tinacy and per|ver&s;ene&s;s, he pronounced the following &s;entence again&s;t them: <HI>Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Beth&s;aida! For, if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented; &s;itting in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes. But it &s;hall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, at the day of judgment, than for you. And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, &s;halt be thru&s;t down to hell.</HI> To this our exalted Redeemer added, as a con&s;ideration which ought to admini&s;ter comfort, and give encouragement to his di&s;ciples: <HI>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that de&s;|pi&s;eth you, de&s;pi&s;eth me; and he that de&s;pi&s;eth me, de&s;pi&s;eth him that &s;ent me.</HI></P>
<P>THIS kind and encouraging declaration, was particularly calculated to comfort and &s;upport the di&s;ciples he was now &s;ending out, under the contempt and ill-u&s;age they would meet with in executing the duties of their mi&s;&s;ion: they could not be ignorant, that the preaching of CHRIST him&s;elf had often been un&s;ucce&s;sful, and that he had been oppo&s;ed, reviled, and de&s;pi&s;ed; and therefore, they had no rea&s;on to conclude, that they &s;hould find a welcome reception, and be received, honoured, and e&s;teemed: but it would, at the wor&s;t of times, afford them great con&s;olation to reflect, that the eternal God was on their &s;ide, and, however they might be de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected by men, they were &s;ure to be received, honoured, and e&s;teemed by their maker.</P>
<P>THE &s;eventy di&s;ciples, having received their commi&s;&s;ion, and in&s;tructions, and being by their Ma&s;ter inve&s;ted with the power of working miracles, they departed and preach|ed according to the tenor of their commi&s;&s;ion, in the cities and villages of Judea and Petrea; and after vi&s;iting &s;everal places, publi&s;hing the glad-tidings of &s;alvation, and work|ing many miracles in confirmation of the truth, they returned to their Ma&s;ter with great joy, &s;aying, <HI>Lord, even the devils are &s;ubject unto us, through thy name.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, it &s;eems rea&s;onable to conclude, that the di&s;ciples, when they &s;et out on this journey, did not know that their power extended &s;o far as to ca&s;t out

devils, and they were, no doubt, plea&s;ingly &s;urpri&s;ed, to find that the apo&s;tate &s;pirits trembled at their Ma&s;ter's name. To this our great Redeemer replied, <HI>I beheld Satan, as lightning, fall from heaven:</HI> as much as to &s;ay, you need not be a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ub|jection and di&s;may of the apo&s;tate &s;pirits, their prince is fallen, I &s;aw him fall as &s;wift as lightning from heaven: I have triumphed over him, I came down from heaven, and was manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h to de&s;troy his works, and he knows I &s;hall finally conquer him and all his legions, and put them down for ever.</P>
<P>OUR Lord then, for the further encouragement of his di&s;ciples, informed them, that he would enlarge their power, and increa&s;e their authority, not only over evil &s;pirits, but over whatever in this world, had power to hurt or annoy them: <HI>Behold,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I give unto your power to tread on &s;erpents, and &s;corpions, and over all the powers of the enemy; and nothing &s;hall by any means hurt you.</HI> At the &s;ame time, our Lord was plea&s;ed to in|form them, that the&s;e miraculous powers were the lea&s;t part of their privilege, and the con&s;equences attending them, not &s;o much to be rejoiced in, as their title to the eternal reward, which he would be&s;tow on all his faithful followers: <HI>Notwith&s;tanding,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>in this rejoice not, that the &s;pirits are &s;ubject unto you; but rather rejoice, that your names are written in the book of life.</HI></P>
<P>NOR could the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS reflect on the wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s of the divine di&s;|pen&s;ations, and the particular care and tenderne&s;s, which the &s;upreme Governor of the univer&s;e, manife&s;ts to the objects of his love, however mean and de&s;pi&s;ed they may be in the eyes of the world, without feeling extraordinary joy; &s;o that his benevolent heart overflowed with &s;treams of gratitude and prai&s;e; 'I thank thee' &s;aid he, 'O Fa|ther, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto babes: even &s;o Father; for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight.'</P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples being returned from their tour, JESUS left Samaria, and journeying into Judea, he was met on the road by a certain lawyer, who, in the language of the New Te&s;tament, is a per&s;on who&s;e employment is the expounding, and explaining the law of Mo&s;es. This per&s;on was de&s;irous to know whether the doctrine which JESUS advanced, were the &s;ame as the precepts of the law; and with this view, he a&s;ked our Redeemer what he mu&s;t do to inherit eternal life. Such was the pride of this teacher of I&s;rael, that it &s;eems by the &s;equel, that he a&s;ked this important que&s;tion, to tempt, and not to be in&s;tructed: but, though our Lord well knew the &s;ecrets of his heart, he did not an&s;wer him with &s;uch a rebuke as he de&s;erved, but in &s;uch a manner as to turn his ba&s;e de&s;ign, and &s;ophi&s;tical eva&s;ions again&s;t him&s;elf: <HI>What,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is written in the law? how reade&s;t thou?</HI> The Scribe an&s;wered, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy &s;trength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>THIS reply our Lord received with approbation, and &s;aid to the lawyer, <HI>Thou ha&s;t an|&s;wered right; this do, and thou &s;halt live;</HI> if thou art able to fulfil the&s;e great precepts of the law, thou maye&s;t claim an intere&s;t in the divine favour, on the footing of the eternal rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s; and as a right to that happine&s;s which is a&s;&s;igned to the keepers of the law: for on the&s;e two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</P>
<P>THE lawyer now perceived him&s;elf taken in his own &s;nare: his con&s;cience could not acquit him of violating the&s;e great duties; he was at a lo&s;s and confounded, and knew

not what to reply: but, yet being willing to &s;ay &s;omething to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, he in|quired, and who is my neighbour? A que&s;tion very natural to be a&s;ked, by a bigoted Jew, who&s;e narrow, &s;elfi&s;h conceptions led him to de&s;pi&s;e all who were not the children of Abraham.</P>
<P>TO correct the low littlene&s;s of &s;uch a private party &s;pirit, to open and enlarge the heart to a more generous and noble way of thinking, to &s;hew them the only founda|tion of true love, and the exten&s;ive relation which they and all mankind &s;tood in to each other, our Lord delivered the following mo&s;t beautiful and in&s;tructive parable.</P>
<P>A certain man went down from Jeru&s;alem to Jericho, and fell among&s;t thieves, which &s;tripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain prie&s;t that way; and when he &s;aw him, he pa&s;&s;ed by on the other &s;ide. And likewi&s;e a Levite, when he was at that place, came and looked on him, and pa&s;&s;ed by on the other &s;ide. But a certain Samaritan, as he journied, came where he was: and when he &s;aw him, he had compa&s;&s;ion on him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and &s;et him on his own bea&s;t, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow, when he de|parted, he took out two pence, and gave them to the ho&s;t, and &s;aid unto him, take care of him; and what&s;oever thou &s;pende&s;t more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</P>
<P>BY this well-cho&s;en, and mo&s;t elegant and affecting parable, our exalted Saviour beautifully inculcated an open and generous di&s;po&s;ition, and greatne&s;s of mind, which lays a&s;ide all &s;elfi&s;h views, and diligently exerts it&s;elf in the great work of doing good to mankind, readily relieving all objects of di&s;tre&s;s, let their national quarrels and religious di&s;|putes be what they will. No per&s;ons were more hated by the Samaritans than the Jews; for which rea&s;on, our Lord repre&s;ents a Samaritan relieving and &s;uccouring a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Jew, when a Prie&s;t and Levite, of his own nation and religion, had for&s;aken him. And this affecting parable our Lord laid down as an an&s;wer to the que&s;tion propo&s;ed by the lawyer, <HI>Who is my neighbour?</HI> and then put it to his own feelings to determine the matter: <HI>Which now of the&s;e three, thinke&s;t thou,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>was neighbour unto him that fell amongst the thieves?</HI> The ca&s;e was &s;o plain, that the lawyer could but reply, <HI>He that &s;hewed mercy on him.</HI> To which our Redeemer immediately returned, with a look which gave the lawyer to under|&s;tand that he knew he was &s;ilenced, <HI>Go and do thou likewi&s;e.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>JESUS</HI> journeying to Jeru&s;alem to be pre&s;ent at the Fea&s;t of Dedication, lodges at Bethany, and is entertained by Martha and Mary: when he arrives at Jeru&s;alem, he attendeth at the Fea&s;t, and di&s;putes with the Jews in Solomon's porch: The Fea&s;t being over, he retires beyond Jordan, and teacheth his di&s;ciples to pray: He ca&s;teth out a Devil: He dines and di&s;putes with the Phari&s;ees, whom he reprehendeth for their outward Shew of Holine&s;s, and pronounceth woes again&s;t them and the Scribes and Lawyers. <HI>CHRIST</HI> teacheth his Di&s;ciples to avoid Hypocri&s;y, and not to be fearful in publi&s;hing his Doctrine: He refu&s;eth to be a Judge in a civil Cau&s;e, and warneth the people to beware of Covetou&s;ne&s;s by the parable of a rich Man, who boa&s;ted him&s;elf in his multiplied Stores: He exhorteth his Di&s;ciples to lay up Trea&s;ure in Heaven by giving alms; and to be always ready again&s;t their Lord's coming.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER our ble&s;&s;ed Lord had effectually &s;ilenced the cavilling lawyer, he continued his journey towards Jeru&s;alem, to be pre&s;ent at the fea&s;t of dedication. In the evening he retired to Bethany, a &s;mall village about two miles from Jeru&s;alem. In this
<PB N="140" REF="029927_0145_0FE3375F0E403D38">
village dwelt Martha and Mary, two pious &s;i&s;ters, who dwelt together in the &s;ame hou&s;e with their brother Lazarus. In this little family, our great Redeemer took up his abode, and was joyfully received by the religious young man and his virtuous &s;i&s;ters. Whether any former acquaintance had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between this family and our great Re|deemer, the evangeli&s;ts have not informed us; but it &s;eems they were not unacquainted with his character, for he was kindly received and generou&s;ly entertained. JESUS, as his cu&s;tom was, wherever he went, took the opportunity of di&s;pen&s;ing his divine in&s;truc|tions, and teaching his ho&s;pitable friends tho&s;e things which concerned their everla&s;t|ing peace. Martha was de&s;irous of expre&s;&s;ing her regard to her noble gue&s;t, by pro|viding a grand entertainment; but Mary, being of a contemplative di&s;po&s;ition, was taken with his divine di&s;cour&s;es, and &s;itting at the feet of our great Redeemer, &s;he li&s;tened to his words with the mo&s;t earne&s;t and &s;teady attention: Martha, being greatly fatigued with the burthen of the &s;ervice, was offended at her &s;i&s;ter, becau&s;e &s;he did not help her, and complained to our Lord of her omi&s;&s;ion: <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>do&s;t thou not care that my &s;i&s;ter hath left me to &s;erve you alone? Bid her therefore that &s;he help me.</HI></P>
<P>BUT JESUS, by his an&s;wer to this di&s;contented &s;i&s;ter, gave her to under&s;tand, that it was more plea&s;ing to him, when per&s;ons attended on his in&s;tructions, and li&s;tened to his words, than all their endeavours to provide &s;umptuous entertainments for him&s;elf and his di&s;ciples: he was not in&s;en&s;ible of any regard which per&s;ons had for him, nor unthankful for their kindne&s;s, in what way &s;oever it was expre&s;&s;ed; but as the good of mankind was his con&s;tant endeavour and care, he always approved tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s be&s;t, which were mo&s;t conducive to that end: nor could he e&s;teem him&s;elf being fed with the food which peri&s;heth, of equal con&s;equence with his be&s;towing on others, that which endureth to everla&s;ting life: <HI>Martha, Martha,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>thou art care|ful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful: and Mary hath cho&s;en that good part, which &s;hall not be taken from her.</HI></P>
<P>FROM this little village JESUS departed to Jeru&s;alem, and attended at the fea&s;t of de|dication. Being in the temple, and &s;tanding in Solomon's porch, he was acco&s;ted by the Jews, who de&s;ired him to tell them plainly, whether he were the Me&s;&s;iah or not? Well knowing, that they did not a&s;k this que&s;tion for information, but to gain an op|portunity of accu&s;ing him to the Romans as a &s;editious per&s;on, who pretended to be the great &s;on of David, promi&s;ed by the prophets, and by this means, de&s;igning to &s;tir up the people to rebellion, and &s;eize on the kingdom; our great Redeemer told them, that they mu&s;t form a judgment of him from his actions: <HI>I told you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and ye believed not: the works I do in my Father's name, they bear witne&s;s of me. But ye believe not, becau&s;e ye are not of my &s;heep, as I &s;aid unto you.</HI> It is in vain to di&s;pute, or lay down rea&s;ons, and arguments to per&s;ons of your temper and &s;pirit; you are under the do|minion of your head&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions and wicked hearts, and your inveterate prejudices will not be overcome; you are not of the number of tho&s;e whom my Father, by his powerful grace, will bring unto me, and cau&s;e to believe in my name; the&s;e happy per|&s;ons are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the power from on high, they carefully and candidly examine the proofs I have given of my mi&s;&s;ion, and they believe in me, and receive me, with all their hearts: nor will the&s;e my followers and friends lo&s;e their rewards; for I will willingly receive them, and make them partakers of eternal life and glory: the&s;e per|&s;ons I will &s;upport and defend; I look upon them as my own, and however indu&s;trious, or a&s;&s;iduous the wicked of this world, or the powers of darkne&s;s, may be to deceive and de&s;troy them, they &s;hall never effect their purpo&s;e; for I &s;tand determined to bring them &s;afe to my heavenly kingdom, and all their enemies may rage in vain: my Father
<PB N="141" REF="029927_0146_0FE337609271B5D0">
hath given them to me: all power, both in heaven and earth, is in his hand, and his omnipotence is engaged in their defence: none is able to contend with him, to prevent the accompli&s;hment of his will, or to hurt the per&s;ons whom he defends: none is able to contend with me, or wre&s;t my people from me; for I and the great eternal Father of the univer&s;e are one: <HI>My &s;heep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. A &s;tranger they will not follow: for they know not the voice of &s;trangers. And I give unto them eternal life; they &s;hall never peri&s;h, neither &s;hall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are one.</HI></P>
<P>THESE words highly provoked the Jews, they con&s;idered them a bla&s;phemous, and were &s;o enraged, that they took up &s;tones to &s;tone the exalted Saviour of &s;inners; they thought they acted in conformity to the law, which commands, that all bla&s;phe|mers &s;hall be &s;toned; but JESUS a&s;ked them, which of the benevolent miracles he had wrought among&s;t them, de&s;erved &s;uch treatment: <HI>Many good works,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>have I &s;hewed you from my Father: for which of the&s;e works do ye &s;tone me.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, I have fed the hungry in the de&s;ert, I have re&s;tored &s;trength to the lame, I have clean&s;|ed the lepers, I have healed the &s;ick, I have ca&s;t out devils, I have rai&s;ed the dead; for which of the&s;e works are ye going to &s;tone me? Do &s;uch miracles as the&s;e admit of the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the author of them is an impo&s;ter? Can you be &s;o &s;tupid as to imagine, that the all-powerful and all-wi&s;e Governor of the world, would permit any per&s;on to perform &s;uch works: with no other intention than to deceive mankind, and to propagate fal&s;hood and error? The Jews replied, we do not &s;uppo&s;e, that thou de|&s;erve&s;t puni&s;hment for any good work which thou ha&s;t performed; puni&s;hment which we are preparing, is di&s;igned to cha&s;ti&s;e thee for thy bla&s;phemous &s;peeches; for thou though, a weak mortal like our&s;elves, arrogantly a&s;&s;ume&s;t the power and maje&s;ty of the mo&s;t High, and, by claiming the incommunicable attributes of deity, make&s;t thy&s;elf God: <HI>For a good work,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>we &s;tone thee not; but for bla&s;phemy, and becau&s;e that thou, being a man, make&s;t thy&s;elf God.</HI> JESUS replied, Has not the Scripture expre&s;sly called tho&s;e <HI>gods,</HI> and the <HI>&s;ons of God,</HI> who were commi&s;&s;ioned to govern God's people, and who by the communication of his Holy Spirit, were qualified for the important office with which they were inve&s;ted; can you, therefore, impute to that per&s;on whom the Almigh|ty hath &s;anctified, and &s;ent into the world, on the mo&s;t important bu&s;ine&s;s that ever any per&s;on was &s;ent into the world to execute, no le&s;s than the &s;alvation of lo&s;t &s;inners; can you, I &s;ay, impute bla&s;phemy to this per&s;on, for taking on him&s;elf the title of the Son of God? If my own declaration be not &s;ufficient to induce you to believe, con&s;ider the works which I have performed, and let them &s;peak for me: is it not abundantly evi|dent, that they mu&s;t be the works of the mo&s;t High, as only omnipotence could per|form them? Is it not then fully manife&s;t, that I and the eternal God are &s;o united, that whatever I &s;ay or do, is approved by him? <HI>Is it not written in your law,</HI> &s;aid our great Redeemer, <HI>I &s;aid, Ye are gods. If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the &s;cripture cannot be broken; &s;ay ye of him whom the Father hath &s;anctified, and &s;ent into the world, Thou bla&s;pheme&s;t, becau&s;e I &s;aid, I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not: but if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may know, and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.</HI></P>
<P>THIS argument, however plain and conclu&s;ive, was far from &s;atisfying the Jews; their wicked hearts were hardened again&s;t the truth, and their deep rooted prejudices were not to be overcome: &s;o that what might have convinced an hone&s;t, impartial in|quirer after truth, had no tendency but to enrage them the more; and our Lord well
<PB N="142" REF="029927_0147_0FE3376CC3845078">
knowing that it would be to no purpo&s;e to rea&s;on with &s;o ob&s;tinate and envious a race, he, either by rendering him&s;elf invi&s;ible, or ca&s;ting confu&s;ion on their minds, departed imperceptibly from among&s;t them, and &s;o e&s;caped their evil de&s;igns.</P>
<P>THE fea&s;t of dedication being over, our Redeemer departed from Jeru&s;alem, and re|tired into the country beyond Jordan, where he was received in a far different manner than he had been at Jeru&s;alem. The people in the&s;e parts had attended on the preach|ing of John the Bapti&s;t, and no doubt remembered the character he gave of the Me&s;&s;iah, who was &s;hortly to appear; and finding the predictions of the Bapti&s;t fully an&s;wered, and fulfilled in JESUS, great numbers were excited to believe.</P>
<P>How long our exalted Saviour, with his train, continued in this country, cannot be clearly determined; but we have no account of his leaving the&s;e parts till he was &s;ent for to Bethany, to rai&s;e Lazarus from the dead: perhaps, the inhabitants of this country en|joyed the un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ing of the pre&s;ence of the Son of God for a con&s;iderable time; and we are informed by the evangeli&s;ts, that while he continued in this country, he pray|ed with &s;uch fervency, that one of his di&s;ciples, who was exceedingly affected both with the matter and manner of his addre&s;s, begged he would teach them to pray. It is pro|bable this di&s;ciple was not with JESUS in the beginning of his mini&s;try, when he gave his directions to his di&s;ciples concerning their devotions: our Lord, however, gave them the &s;ame form of words as he had done before, and gave them &s;ome directions re&s;pecting their conduct, and exhorted them to con&s;tancy and fervency in their prayers: <HI>And I &s;ay unto you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>a&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find; knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you. For every one that a&s;keth receiveth: and he that &s;eeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it &s;hall be opened.</HI></P>
<P>AND, for their encouragement in the great duty of prayer, he referred to their own feelings with re&s;pect to their children, and called upon them to judge by the&s;e, of the readine&s;s of their heavenly Father, to hear and grant their petitions: 'If, &s;aid he, a &s;on &s;hall a&s;k bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a &s;tone? Or if he a&s;k a fi&s;h, will he give him a &s;erpent? Or if he &s;hall a&s;k an egg, will he offer him a &s;corpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more &s;hall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that a&s;k him?'</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e things, our great Redeemer was applied to by the friends of one who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a devil; he graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to grant the reque&s;t, and ca&s;t out the evil &s;pirit, re&s;toring the di&s;ordered per&s;on to perfect tranquility of mind: but &s;ome of the envious and unbelieving Jews were pre&s;ent, and, as the Phari&s;ees had formerly done, a&s;cribed this &s;tupendous work to the power of the devil. The evangeli&s;t informs us, that he was ca&s;ting out a devil, and it was dumb; and it came to pa&s;s, when the devil was gone out the dumb &s;pake; and the people wondered. But &s;ome of them &s;aid, 'He ca&s;teth out devils through Belzebub, the chief of the devils.'</P>
<P>HOWEVER weak and frivolous this argument may &s;eem, and however incon&s;i&s;tent and ab&s;urd it may appear to impartial judges, it had con&s;iderable influence and effect on the ignorant and illiterate, e&s;pecially on &s;uch who&s;e prejudices and intere&s;ts it favoured. The Phari&s;ees were exa&s;perated at our great Redeemer's conduct, in expo&s;ing and con|demning their fooli&s;h traditions, and they indulged a fixed and habitual hatred again&s;t him: the&s;e traditions were con&s;idered, by the learned men and teachers of the age, as the very e&s;&s;entials of religion; and by his oppo&s;ing the&s;e, and expo&s;ing them to ridicule and contempt, they concluded, that he mu&s;t be a very wicked per&s;on. They had in|&s;pired the common people with the highe&s;t veneration and reverence for the&s;e external
<PB N="143" REF="029927_0148_0FE3376E47FAA5F8">
ceremonious performances, and, therefore, it is no wonder that they were ready to join them in their re&s;entment, and oppo&s;e and per&s;ecute a per&s;on who had &s;poken lightly of things which they e&s;teemed &s;o &s;acred: the great men and leaders of the Jews, had al&s;o a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">otion, that a fal&s;e prophet had the power of working &s;igns and wonders, and received this power from, and exerted it by, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of wicked &s;pirits; and, therefore, they were very ready to believe that our Saviour was in league with hell, and performed his miracles by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the prince of darkne&s;s, with de&s;ign to &s;educe the people with lying wonders, and turn them from the wor&s;hip of the true God.</P>
<P>AND wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nduced them the more readily to embrace this opinion, was the te&s;timo|ny of the devils them&s;elves, who, when they were ca&s;t out, very frequently and with|out he&s;itation, confe&s;&s;ed that JESUS was the Son of God; which the Phari&s;ees &s;uppo&s;ed they would not have done, except it was to carry on the deception: the blinded rulers of I&s;rael, not perceiving that the devils were forced to confe&s;s the Me&s;&s;iah, and to &s;ub|mit to &s;uperior power. How ab&s;urd and ridiculous &s;oever this argument appears to the judicious and impartial, yet as it coincided with the prejudice of the Jews, it had great influence on their minds, and tended to fix them in final unbelief: and however we may be &s;urpri&s;ed that &s;uch weak rea&s;ons &s;hould have any effect, con&s;idering what multitudes were witne&s;&s;es to the many miracles which the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS performed, and con&s;idering the nature of tho&s;e miracles was &s;uch, as it is not ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e the Devil would have any hand in performing; yet experience hath abundantly convinced us, that &s;uch kind of argument<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, joined with their own prejudices, and &s;uper&s;titious opinions, had a great influence in fixing that ob&s;tinate people in their infidelity.</P>
<P>BUT though &s;ome among&s;t the multitude of &s;pectators, were content to a&s;cribe this miracle to the power of the Devil, others were not willing &s;o ha&s;tily and incon&s;ide|rately to form &s;o ba&s;e a conclu&s;ion, but de&s;ired to &s;u&s;pend their opinion till other proofs might be produced, or our Redeemer might have an opportunity to e&s;tabli&s;h his cha|racter by a different kind of evidence; and therefore, they de&s;ired him to prove him|&s;elf the Me&s;&s;iah, by given them a &s;ign from heaven. But JESUS knowing their thoughts, and being privy to the rancour, and wickedne&s;s of their hearts, refu&s;ed to grant their reque&s;t: but told them that they were a wicked race of mortals, and di&s;covered a very ob&s;tinate and perver&s;e di&s;po&s;ition, by &s;eeking a &s;ign from heaven, after &s;uch a number of miracles had been performed, as were &s;ufficient to convince any impartial and un|prejudiced mind. He therefore informed them that no &s;ign &s;hould be given them, but that of the prophet Jonas, <HI>This,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is an evil generation: they &s;eek a &s;ign; and there &s;hall no &s;ign be given it, but the &s;ign of Jonas the prophet.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN JESUS had ended his di&s;cour&s;e, one of the Phari&s;ees pre&s;ent invited him to dine with him; our Lord accepted the invitation, though probably it was not love and good-will which excited the Phari&s;ee to make it; he accompanied the inviter to his hou&s;e, and &s;at down at the table without performing the ceremony of wa&s;hing, &s;o care|fully ob&s;erved by the other gue&s;ts: an omi&s;&s;ion of this kind could not fail of &s;urpri&s;|ing the Phari&s;ee, as JESUS thereby &s;hewed an open contempt of their traditions. Our Lord, who well knew the thoughts of this bigoted, &s;elf-conceited Phari&s;ee, &s;aid unto him, you Phari&s;ees are remarkably careful to keep every thing clean which touches your food, le&s;t, by eating it, your bodies &s;hould be polluted; but you take no care to clean&s;e your minds from the pollution of wickedne&s;s. You cannot be ignorant that he who created the body, al&s;o formed and in&s;pired the &s;oul; and can you imagine that the Almighty, who approves of purity of body, becau&s;e it is the work of his hands, and becau&s;e it conduces to the health thereof, will not al&s;o in&s;i&s;t on a greater

purity of the &s;oul, which is doubtle&s;s the far noble&s;t part po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by man. In&s;tead therefore, of that &s;crupulous care and exactne&s;s in wa&s;hing your hands when you &s;it down to meat, ye &s;hould be careful to clean&s;e your hearts from all pollution, and fer|vently pray to the God of I&s;rael to purify your minds; this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nder it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;&s;ible for any external thing to defile you, and will at all times be looked upon with com|placency and delight by the God of purity. <HI>Now,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>do you Phari&s;ees <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ke clean the out&s;ide of the cup of platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedne&s;s. Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without, make that which is within al&s;o? but rather give alms of &s;uch things as ye have; and behold, all things are clean unto you.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH was the language of the Son of God, but the proud &s;elf-conceited Phari&s;ees would not hear; however clear and convincing, however mild and per&s;ua&s;ive, the rea|&s;onings of our great Redeemer were, the inveterate prejudices and rooted unbelief of the&s;e men, prevented the&s;e excellent di&s;cour&s;es from having their proper effect. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour therefore treated them with more &s;everity, and denounced again&s;t them the mo&s;t heavy woes for their hypocri&s;y, which was manife&s;t in their &s;crupulous exact|ne&s;s in the performance of the minute&s;t part of the ceremonial ob&s;ervances, contained in their traditions, while they were mo&s;t &s;candalou&s;ly carele&s;s and negligent in the weightier matters of the law: <HI>Woe unto you, Phari&s;ees! &s;aid he, for ye tithe mint and rue, and all manner of herbs, and pa&s;s over judgment, and the love of God: the&s;e ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Woe unto you, Phari&s;ees! for ye love the uppermo&s;t &s;eats in the &s;ynagogues, and greeting in the markets. Woe unto you, Scribes and Phari&s;ees, hy|pocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH this di&s;cour&s;e was principally a&s;&s;igned to affect the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, a certain lawyer, who &s;at at the table, thinking that this rebuke a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">cted per&s;ons of his pro|fe&s;&s;ion, was very much offended; but our great Redeemer, who regarded not the per&s;ons nor profe&s;&s;ions of men, plainly told him what was his real character: <HI>Woe unto you al&s;o, ye lawyers,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye your&s;elves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.</HI></P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS al&s;o blamed the conduct of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, for building the &s;epulchres of the prophets, whom their fathers had murdered; becau&s;e they did not erect the&s;e edifices &s;o much out of re&s;pect to the memory of the decea&s;ed worthies, as to exhibit the utmo&s;t o&s;tentation of piety, and make them&s;elves admired for their noble &s;en|timents; while, by their con&s;tant line of conduct, they gave rea&s;on to conclude, that they &s;ecretly entertained the &s;ame hatred to reproof, and unconquerable ob&s;tinacy and per|ver&s;ene&s;s, which excited their fathers to the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and cruel of their actions: 'Woe unto you,' &s;aid he, 'for ye build the &s;epulchre of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. Truly ye bear witne&s;s that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build them &s;epulchres. Therefore al&s;o &s;aid the wi&s;dom of God, I will &s;end them prophets and apo&s;tles, and &s;ome of them they &s;hall &s;lay and per&s;e|cute: that the blood of all the prophets, which was &s;hed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation: from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which peri&s;hed between the altar and the temple: verily, I &s;ay unto you, it &s;hall be required of this generation.' As our Redeemer well knew that this hardened and unbelieving generation, would &s;pill the blood of the Son of God, and of con&s;e|quence be guilty of the blacke&s;t, and mo&s;t impious and horrid martyrdom, which could be committed: he might ju&s;tly repre&s;ent them, as the mo&s;t black, horrid, and hateful race of murderers, as guilty in them&s;elves, as much to be abhorred, and equally de|&s;erving

peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hed vengeance, as if they had &s;hed all the innocent blood which ever had been &s;pilt in the world.</P>
<P>OUR great Redeemer, after pronouncing the&s;e woes, turned his di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t the lawyers, and condemned them for filling the minds of the people with wrong notions, ari&s;ing from forced interpretations of the &s;criptures; by which means the minds of the people were prejudiced again&s;t the go&s;pel, and prevented from receiving the truth: <HI>Woe unto you lawyers!</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye enter not in your&s;elves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER ju&s;t and rea&s;onable the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es were, the &s;everity of the rebukes con|tained in them, was highly provoking to tho&s;e Scribes and Phari&s;ees; they were con|&s;cious of being guilty of the crimes laid to their charge, but their pride could not bear the thoughts of being &s;unk in the opinion of the people, who heard the&s;e remarks; their minds were agitated with conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, but pride and envy urged them to the mo&s;t ba&s;e and de&s;picable actions; their ri&s;ing re&s;entment &s;tudied revenge, and they were &s;o mean as to urge our exalted Redeemer to di&s;cour&s;e on various &s;ubjects, with no other view than to en&s;nare him, and by that means render him obnoxious, either to the Roman government, or to the common people among&s;t the Jews, the evangeli&s;t in|forms us, that, as he &s;aid the&s;e things unto them, the Scribes and Phari&s;ees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to &s;peak of many things, laying in wait for him, and &s;eeking to catch &s;omething out of his mouth, that they might accu&s;e him.</P>
<P>OUR great Redeemer baffled all their attempts, and leaving the hou&s;e of the Phari|&s;ee, he went among&s;t the multitude, which was waiting at the door; &s;o great were the numbers, and &s;o hard did they pre&s;s to get near the exalted per&s;on of our Saviour, that they trod one upon another. The fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e he held with the multitude, after he had left the Phari&s;ee's hou&s;e, was to warn them again&s;t the pernicious poi&s;on of the Phari&s;ee's example, who appeared in di&s;gui&s;e, and pretended to be the mo&s;t &s;trict in the ob&s;ervance of the law, the mo&s;t &s;imple in their manners, and pure and &s;potle&s;s in their conver&s;ation, when, at the &s;ame time, they were privately guilty of the mo&s;t gro&s;s and &s;candalous vices: our Lord, therefore, exhorted the multitude to be very careful not to do any thing which would not bear the light, but let the whole of their behaviour be hone&s;t, open, and upright; for the time would come, when all &s;ecrets will be revealed, and all the works of darkne&s;s brought to light: 'Beware ye,' &s;aid he, 'of the leaven of the Phari&s;ees, which is hypocri&s;y. For there is nothing covered, which &s;hall not be revealed; neither hid, that &s;hall not be known. Therefore, whatever ye have &s;poken in darkne&s;s, &s;hall be heard in the light, and that which ye have &s;poken in the ear in clo&s;ets, &s;hall be proclaimed upon the hou&s;e tops.'</P>
<P>OUR Redeemer proceeded to ob&s;erve, that an open, hone&s;t cour&s;e of conduct, above hypocri&s;y, and di&s;daining all di&s;gui&s;e, would enable them to put their tru&s;t in their Maker; while the contrary conduct tended to fill the mind with that fear of man, which is &s;o prejudicial to the welfare of the &s;oul: he therefore exhorted them, not to fear the malice or power of any of the &s;ons of men; the&s;e can extend no further than the death of the body, but cannot touch the immortal &s;oul, which may bid defiance to the impotent rage of the gloomy tyrant, and never tremble at the fury of the oppre&s;&s;or: &s;uch weak and feeble creatures as men, are not to be feared, but the wrath of the eternal God ought rather to be dreaded; he is able, after he hath de&s;troyed the body, to con|fine the &s;oul in eternal torments. How happy are the per&s;ons who are under his holy protection: all things are in his power, nothing can e&s;cape his notice, nor any thing

happen without his permi&s;&s;ion: <HI>And I &s;ay unto you, my friends,</HI> &s;aid our great Redeemer, <HI>be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that, have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom ye &s;hall fear: fear him, which, after he hath killed, hath power to ca&s;t into hell; yea, I &s;ay unto you fear him. Are not five &s;parrows &s;old for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? But even the very hairs of your head are all num|bered. Fear not therefore; ye are of more value than many &s;parrows.</HI></P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS thought fit to add, that the fear of man would be a &s;nare to great numbers, and prevent them from confe&s;&s;ing the truth; but whoever were overcome by this prevailing principle, and were a&s;hamed to acknowledge our Saviour, would be finally rejected at the awful day, when he would &s;it in judgment, and own and reward all his faithful followers: and whoever were induced to &s;peak evil of the Spirit of God, the grand agent in carrying on the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom in the hearts of men, our Re|deemer informed them, &s;hould be puni&s;hed with peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hed vengeance, by a ju&s;tly provoked, &s;in avenging God: <HI>Al&s;o I &s;ay unto you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>who&s;oever &s;hall con|fe&s;s me before men, him &s;hall the Son of man al&s;o confe&s;s before the angels of God. And who|&s;oever &s;hall &s;peak a word again&s;t the Son of man, it &s;hall be forgiven him: but unto him that bla&s;phemeth again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, it &s;hall not be forgiven.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING &s;hewn the nece&s;&s;ity of boldly confe&s;&s;ing him before men, he proceeded to encourage his di&s;ciples with the promi&s;e of immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when they were brought before princes, and the great men of the earth; which divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance would deliver them from all embarra&s;&s;ment, re&s;pecting what they &s;hould an&s;wer, when they were ex|amined concerning their faith: <HI>And when they bring you unto the &s;ynagogues, and unto magi&s;trates, and powers, take ye no thought how, or what ye &s;hall an&s;wer, or what ye &s;hall &s;ay; for the Holy Gho&s;t &s;hall teach you in the &s;ame hour, what ye ought to &s;ay.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS was delivering the&s;e exhortations to his di&s;ciples, a per&s;on among&s;t the &s;urrounding multitude, begged that he would interpo&s;e his authority with his brother, in order to oblige him to divide the paternal inheritance with him; but, as this deci&s;ion properly belonged to the magi&s;trate, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who did not come into the world to &s;ettle worldly affairs, but to attend to tho&s;e things which concerned the immortal &s;oul, declined the ta&s;k, with this reply, <HI>Man, who made me a judge or a di|vider over you?</HI> He took occa&s;ion, however, from hence, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to caution his hearers again&s;t covetou&s;ne&s;s: for he ob&s;erved that neither the length nor the happine&s;s of life depended on the largene&s;s of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: 'Take heed,' &s;aid he, 'and beware of covetou&s;ne&s;s; for a man's life con&s;i&s;teth not in the abundance of the things which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth.'</P>
<P>AND to enforce this important exhortation, he placed before them, in the &s;tronge&s;t, and mo&s;t alarming point of light, an example of the bewitching influence of wealth in the parable of the rich glutton, who was &s;uddenly cut off in the mid&s;t of his projects, and became a dreadful example of the folly of ama&s;&s;ing the riches of this world, and depending on the goods of this life, without any regard to the government of God, or the intere&s;ts of the immortal &s;oul. This wretched man, forgetting his mortality, made preparations for a long and luxurious life, plea&s;ing him&s;elf with the thoughts of a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;ual enjoyments: but, alas! whil&s;t he was providing repo&s;itories for his va&s;t riches, he was arre&s;ted by the king of terrors, and hurried, without time for con&s;i|deration, into the eternal world. The parable which our great Redeemer put forth on this occa&s;ion, is contained in the&s;e words: 'The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: and he thought within him&s;elf, &s;aying, What &s;hall I do, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="147" REF="029927_0152_0FE3377B4C2256A8">
I have no room where to be&s;tow my fruits? And he &s;aid, this will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I be&s;tow all my fruits, and my goods. And I will &s;ay to my &s;oul, &s;oul, thou ha&s;t much goods laid up for many years; take thine ea&s;e, eat, drink, and be merry. But God &s;aid unto him, thou fool, this night thy &s;oul &s;hall be required of thee: then who&s;e &s;hall tho&s;e things be which thou ha&s;t provided?'</P>
<P>WHAT an awful &s;ummons was this! How unexpected, how alarming, how dreadful! The man lying on his bed, full of anxiety, care, and &s;olicitude, not to acquire wealth, but how to make room to lodge it, and how to enjoy it: doubtle&s;s he thought, that riches gave him a title to every gratification and enjoyment which the world can afford, or the &s;en&s;e and appetite of man partake of: his re&s;tle&s;s thought ranges though the wide fields of di&s;&s;ipation and plea&s;ure, and &s;uch numerous &s;cenes of imaginary delight pre&s;s on his ravi&s;hed &s;en&s;es, he knows not where to fix. In the mid&s;t of this plea&s;ing perplexity, a &s;trange me&s;&s;enger &s;trikes at his brea&s;t. Who is it that thus alarms him? It is the great king of terrors, he comes commi&s;&s;ioned to de&s;troy; the ca&s;e admits of no refu&s;al or de|lay. Is there no refuge! is there no deliverer! Call the phy&s;icians: they in&s;tantly at|tend, but with looks &s;olemn and &s;ad. What! is there no hope? So often as you have partook of my bounty, and &s;uch obligations as you are under to me. They all, with grief, declare the ca&s;e beyond their art.&mdash;Then &s;ay, how long I have to live.&mdash;The com|pa&s;s of the night concludes your earthly race.&mdash;How &s;hort the warning, and with what ha&s;ty &s;teps the dread de&s;troyer advances to &s;top my breath! But is there no way to appea&s;e him, and engage him to hold his hand? Will he not be per&s;uaded? He makes no agreement nor league with any. Will not pity excite him, or petitions move him? He knows no pity, and he hears no prayers. Will not my riches bribe him? Riches are unavailable in the hour of death; nor will mountains of gold delay the awful &s;troke one moment. But how many wretched creatures are there, who would be glad of his friendly aid to de&s;troy a loathed exi&s;tence? Why then &s;hould he attack one who had &s;uch va&s;t pro&s;pects of plea&s;ure and delight before him, and gloried in the expectation of many happy years to come? He acts according to his commi&s;&s;ion from above, and the awful &s;troke no mortal can e&s;cape or evade a moment. Then all is over! let me think who &s;hall be my heir. But rea&s;on failed; and, before that important point could be &s;ettled, the poor deluded mortal expired. And now, in&s;tead of a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;en|&s;ual delights, an awful eternity pre&s;ents it&s;elf to view, and the poor &s;oul is terrified and plunged into the depths of de&s;pair and horror, at the pro&s;pect of judgment to come. A dark night of horror in an in&s;tant overwhelms that &s;oul, which had promi&s;ed it&s;elf &s;o much ea&s;e and plea&s;ure; and, in&s;tead of eating, drinking, and making merry; in&s;tead of gay &s;cenes of di&s;&s;ipation, and a variety of &s;en&s;ual delights; eternal tortures, un&s;peak|able thir&s;t, weeping, wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth, mu&s;t be the portion of this mi&s;erable being to all eternity.</P>
<P><HI>So is he,</HI> added our great Redeemer, <HI>that layeth up trea&s;ure for him&s;elf, and is not rich to|ward God.</HI> Thus &s;hall he be taken away from all that his &s;oul de&s;ireth; thus &s;hall he be torn from all his temporal pro&s;pects and plea&s;ures; none of his beloved enjoyments &s;hall follow him; naked as he came &s;hall he depart out of the world; nor could all his riches, could he take them with him, be able to procure him the lea&s;t comfort or re&s;|pite in this world of horrors. How &s;hould this reflection awaken us from our plea&s;ing dreams of comfort and happine&s;s, in this world of mi&s;ery, this vale of tears: how &s;hould it convince us of the uncertainty of all &s;ublunary good, and the utter impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of the things of this world to &s;atisfy the &s;oul, or made us truly happy: how &s;hould
<PB N="148" REF="029927_0153_0FE3377CD1746DF8">
it alarm us, when, planning fancied &s;chemes of worldly plea&s;ure or advantage, without the lea&s;t con&s;ideration of the great Di&s;po&s;er of all events: how &s;hould it reconcile us to the di&s;po&s;al of infinite Wi&s;dom, when our portion of temporal things is &s;mall and &s;canty; and we are &s;urrounded with difficulties and troubles, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the great King of the univer&s;e, all our promi&s;es of &s;ecurity are vain and fooli&s;h; he can render all our labours abortive; and the riche&s;t and mo&s;t opulent per&s;on, when they think them&s;elves &s;ecure, and are planning &s;chemes of plea&s;ure and gratification, may, in a mo|ment, be &s;tripped of all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and torn from all their comforts; when the &s;oul, naked and defencele&s;s, and clothed in all its guilt, will enter into an awful eternity, and be brought, trembling and a&s;toni&s;hed, to the throne of its offended Maker.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, having delivered this awakening parable, proceeded to apply it to his di&s;ciples; and from hence took occa&s;ion to warn them of an over &s;olicitous care, concern, and de&s;ire after the things of this world. He rather advi&s;ed them to tru&s;t in God, who&s;e fatherly care extends it&s;elf over all his creatures: the fowls of heaven are fed by his bounty, and the lilies are clothed in brighter hues, and more glorious raiment than the greate&s;t monarch. If, therefore, argued the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, the great Governor of all things &s;o carefully provides for the inferior part of his creation; if he feeds the ra|vens and clothes the lilies; &s;urely the children of men have the highe&s;t rea&s;on to depend on his all-pre&s;erving, and all-&s;upporting goodne&s;s; e&s;pecially tho&s;e who have the well-grounded hopes, that the great Eternal Maker and &s;upporter of all things, has appointed them to happine&s;s in a future &s;tate, have little rea&s;on to doubt that he will not provide them all that is nece&s;&s;ary for their comfort and &s;upport in this: <HI>Fear not,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>little flock: for it is your Father's good plea&s;ure to give you the kingdom.</HI> At the &s;ame time, he gave his di&s;ciples another precept, particularly calculated for tho&s;e times in which the profe&s;|&s;ion of the go&s;pel expo&s;ed men to the lo&s;s of their &s;ub&s;tance: &s;ell that ye have, &s;aid he, and give alms; provide your&s;elves bags, which wax not old, a trea&s;ure in the hea|vens, that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth: for where your trea&s;ure is, there will your heart be al&s;o.</P>
<P>HAVING thus exhorted them to the di&s;engagement of their affections from the things of this world, he advi&s;ed them to be at all times ready for the di&s;charge of their duty: <HI>Let,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye your&s;elves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was &s;poken in allu&s;ion to the cu&s;toms of the ea&s;tern countries, where anciently great entertainments were made in the evening; and on the&s;e occa&s;ions, &s;ervants de|mon&s;trated their diligence, by watching, and keeping their loins girded that they might be ready to open the door on the fir&s;t knock of their ma&s;ter: nor was it uncommon for the ma&s;ter, in order to reward &s;uch a &s;ervant, to order him a repa&s;t, and &s;ometimes even to give it him with his own hand. In allu&s;ion to which cu&s;tom, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour added, 'Ble&s;&s;ed are tho&s;e &s;ervants, whom the Lord, when he cometh, &s;hall find watch|ing: verily, I &s;ay unto you, that he &s;hall gird him&s;elf, and make them to &s;it down to meat, and will come forth and &s;erve them.'</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>JESUS</HI> remarks the Ignorance and Stupidity of the Jews, in not di&s;cerning the Times; and &s;hew|eth the Danger of neglecting the Means of Reconciliation offered them: He &s;heweth, that tem|poral Calamities are no &s;ure Signs of Sinfulne&s;s, but that others &s;hould take warning by them, and repent: He delivers the Parable of the Fig-Tree, that was ordered to be cut down for being fruitle&s;s: He healeth a Woman that had been long bowed together, and putteth the hypo|critical Ruler of the Synagogue to &s;ilence. <HI>CHRIST</HI> being a&s;ked of the number of the Saved, he exhorteth to &s;trive to enter in at the &s;traight Gate: He is warned to leave the Dominions of Herod, but will not be diverted from his Cour&s;e through Fear; and lamenteth over the approaching De&s;olation of Jeru&s;alem: He healeth the Drop&s;y on the Sabbath, and ju&s;tifieth his doing &s;o: He recommendeth Humility, and Ho&s;pitality towards the Poor: And delivers the Parable of the Marriage-Supper, and of the Gue&s;ts, who making excu&s;es, were excluded, and their Rooms filled by others.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING concluded his in&s;tructions to his di&s;ciples, our Lord then addre&s;&s;ed the multitude, and remarked the prevailing infidelity of the Jewi&s;h nation, and ob|&s;erved, that the evidences of his being the Me&s;&s;iah, were clearer and &s;tronger than tho&s;e marks in the &s;ky, which denominated fair o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rainy weather to be approaching: and though the people were very accute and &s;egacious in the one, they were unaccountably blind and undi&s;cerning in the other: 'When ye &s;ee a cloud ri&s;e out of the we&s;t, &s;traight|way ye &s;ay, There cometh a &s;hower; and &s;o it is. And when ye &s;ee the &s;outh wind blow, ye &s;ay, There will be heat; and it cometh to pa&s;s. Ye hypocrites, ye can di&s;|cern the face of the &s;ky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not di&s;cern this time?'</P>
<P>BUT he proceeded to let them know, that their blindne&s;s, ob&s;tinacy, and rebellion, &s;hould be &s;everely puni&s;hed, and that he would come in as unexpected a manner, as a thief cometh in the night: he therefore exhorted them to a &s;peedy reformation, telling them that they ought to con&s;ider well what way their peace was to be expected, and di|ligently attend to tho&s;e things which would pre&s;erve them from the con&s;equences of their rebellion. 'When thou goe&s;t with thine adver&s;ary to the magi&s;trate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou maye&s;t be delivered from him; le&s;t he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer ca&s;t thee into pri&s;on: I tell thee thou &s;halt not depart thence, till thou ha&s;t paid the very la&s;t mite.'</P>
<P>SOME of his hearers thought proper to confirm this doctrine, by giving what they thought an example of it: There were pre&s;ent at that &s;ea&s;on, &s;ome that told him of the Galileans, who&s;e blood Pilate had mingled with their &s;acrifices; thinking that the&s;e per&s;ons had been guilty of &s;ome extraordinary crime for which providence had per|mitted this dreadful puni&s;hment to befal them: but our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour expre&s;sly told them, that they were much mi&s;taken in this conclu&s;ion, for this deplorable calami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y was no indication that the&s;e Galileans were greater &s;inners than their countrymen. At the &s;ame time, he exhorted them to improve &s;uch in&s;tances of calamity and mi&s;ery, as incitements to their own repentance, a&s;&s;uring them that if they neglected &s;o ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary a work, they &s;hould all peri&s;h: <HI>And Je&s;us an&s;wering, &s;aid unto them, Suppo&s;e ye that the&s;e Galileans were &s;inners above all the Galileans, becau&s;e they &s;uffered &s;uch things? I tell you, Nay: but, except you repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>HE further illu&s;trated this doctrine, by remarking, that this way of interpreting the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, would lead them to erroneous conclu&s;ions, whenever they
<PB N="150" REF="029927_0155_0FE3378AB6ECCE68">
heard of unexpected and dreadful evils falling on the &s;ons of men; and in&s;tanced the ca&s;e of the eighteen per&s;ons on whom the tower of Siloam fell, and cru&s;hed them to pieces: <HI>Or,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>tho&s;e eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and &s;lew them, think ye that they were &s;inner above all men that dwelt in Jeru&s;alem? I tell you, Nay: but, ex|cept you repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord al&s;o endeavoured to rou&s;e them to the con&s;ideration of their &s;tate, by the parable of the fig-tree, which the ma&s;ter of the vineyard, after finding it three years barren, ordered to be de&s;troyed, but at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of the dre&s;&s;er of the vine|yard, it was &s;pared one year longer: <HI>A certain man,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and &s;ought fruit thereon, and found none. Then &s;aid he unto the dre&s;&s;er of his vineyard, Behold, the&s;e three years I come &s;eeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none: cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground? And he an&s;wering, &s;aid unto him, lord, let it alone this year al&s;o, till I dig about it, and dung it: and if it bear fruit, well; and if not, then after that thou &s;halt cut it down.</HI></P>
<P>BY this parable, our Lord repre&s;ented the goodne&s;s, and forbearance of his Almighty Father, manife&s;ted towards the Jewi&s;h nation, where his Son had now been about three years, preaching the kingdom of God; and though they might be ju&s;tly de&s;troyed for their ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s, yet the awful &s;troke was delayed, and &s;pace was given them for repentance; but he gave them a &s;trong intimation, in this parable, that if they per&s;i&s;ted, they mu&s;t expect that vengeance will not always &s;leep, but, after all the divine forbearance had been abu&s;ed, would awake to their &s;udden and dreadful de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>WHEN our Lord was teaching in one of the &s;ynagogues in Perea, on the Sabbath-day, he ob&s;erved a woman, who, for the &s;pace of eighteen years, had not been able to &s;tand upright: a per&s;on labouring under &s;o dreadful a di&s;order, could not fail of excit|ing the compa&s;&s;ion of the benevolent Saviour of &s;inners, he beheld this affecting ob|ject with pity, and he removed her complaint; &s;he who came to the &s;ynagogue bowed down to the ground with an infirmity, returned to her hou&s;e upright, being by the all-powerful Son of God, re&s;tored to perfect health.</P>
<P>THIS benevolent action, which &s;urely de&s;erved the thanks of the whole congrega|tion, &s;o highly offended the ma&s;ter of the &s;ynagogue, that he openly te&s;tified his di&s;|plea&s;ure, and reproved the people, and repre&s;ented them as Sabbath-breakers, becau&s;e they came that day to be healed: <HI>There are &s;ix days,</HI> &s;aid this &s;urly, &s;elf-conceited ruler to the people, <HI>in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath-day.</HI></P>
<P>BUT our Lord &s;oon &s;ilenced this &s;elf-conceited Phari&s;ee, by ob&s;erving that he had not deviated from their own avowed practice: they made no &s;cruple of loo&s;ing their cattle, and leading them to the water on the Sabbath-day, becau&s;e the mercy of the action &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified them for performing it; and &s;urely his action of loo&s;ing, by a &s;ingle word, a woman, a rational creature, a daughter of Abraham, who had been bound by an incurable di&s;temper, the tedious &s;pace of eighteen years, was abundantly ju&s;tified: nor could this bigoted ruler have thought otherwi&s;e, had not his rea&s;on been blinded by his &s;uper&s;tition. Such was the &s;entiment of the Son of God, who an&s;wered him with this &s;evere rebuke, 'Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the Sabbath, loo&s;e his ox or his a&s;s from the &s;tall, and lead him away to watering? And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound,

lo, the&s;e eighteen years, be loo&s;ed from this bond on the Sabbath-day?' And when he had &s;aid the&s;e things, all his adver&s;aries were a&s;hamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</P>
<P>FROM this in&s;tance we may remark the evil effects of &s;uper&s;tition and a bigoted at|tachment to cu&s;toms and ceremonies, which have no foundation in rea&s;on nor the re|vealed will of God; the&s;e pernicious principles oppo&s;e the u&s;e of the faculties, root compa&s;&s;ion out of the heart, and de&s;troy the feelings of humanity.</P>
<P>OUR Lord having &s;ilenced the proud ruler of the &s;ynagogue, and received the ac|clamations and applau&s;es of the people, he reflected with plea&s;ure on the truth, rea&s;on, and divine power from above, which &s;upport his kingdom; and, on this occa&s;ion, he repeated the parables of the grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed, and the leaven, to &s;hew the future &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel, and the power and influence of his religion on the hearts and lives of men, and its rapid progre&s;s through the world, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of the great men of the earth, and the fury of the unthinking multitude.</P>
<P>OUR Lord having thus &s;own the &s;eeds of the go&s;pel in the country of Perea, he cro&s;&s;ed Jordan, and proceeded by &s;low and &s;hort &s;tages towards Jeru&s;alem, preaching the go&s;pel in every village, and publi&s;hing the glad-tidings of &s;alvation to the inhabitants of the countries he pa&s;&s;ed through.</P>
<P>WHILE he was thus pro&s;ecuting the great work of in&s;tructing mankind, one of the per&s;ons who accompanied him, inquired, 'Lord, are there few that be &s;aved.' Proba|bly the per&s;on who propo&s;ed this que&s;tion, had heard our Lord de&s;cribe the &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel, by the parables of the mu&s;tard-&s;eed, and the leaven; and had no further views of the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah, than the &s;etting up a temporal dominion. The&s;e notions were entertained by the Jews in general, and induced them to conclude, that CHRIST hereby meant no more than a temporal &s;alvation. JESUS, to convince this cu|rious inquirer, and the re&s;t of the Jews, that he had no intention to erect a &s;ecular kingdom, an&s;wered his que&s;tion in a &s;piritual manner, by which he gave the Jews to under&s;tand, that very few of them would be partakers of the honour and happine&s;s of his kingdom; and he exhorted them to u&s;e their utmo&s;t efforts to know the truth, and become members of the church, and heirs of glory, by improving the means which were afforded them; for the time would &s;oon come, he a&s;&s;ured them, when the means which they now enjoyed would be taken away, and they would perceive their &s;tate to be finally and irrevocably determined, and then, however earne&s;tly they might de&s;ire &s;uch opportunities as they now enjoyed, they &s;hould not be able to attain them: <HI>Strive,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to enter in at the &s;traight gate: for many, I &s;ay unto you, will &s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not be able. When once the Ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e is ri&s;en up, and hath &s;hut to the door, and ye begin to &s;tand without, and to knock at the door, &s;aying, Lord, Lord, open unto us, and be &s;hall an&s;wer, and &s;ay unto you, I know you not whence you are.</HI> This &s;entence our Lord informed them would be final, and not to be altered by their mo&s;t earne&s;t peti|tions and expo&s;tulations: <HI>Then,</HI> added our great Redeemer, <HI>&s;hall ye begin to &s;ay, We have eaten and drank in thy pre&s;ence, and thou ha&s;t taught in our &s;treets. But he &s;hall &s;ay, I tell you, I know you not whence you are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. There &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth, when ye &s;hall &s;ee Abraham, and I&s;aac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you your&s;elves thru&s;t out. And they &s;hall come from the Ea&s;t, and from the We&s;t, and from the North, and from the South, and &s;hall &s;it down in the kingdom of God. And behold, there are la&s;t which &s;hall be fir&s;t, and there are fir&s;t which &s;hall be la&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="029927_0157_0FE3378DDA42A800">SOON after our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had delivered the&s;e &s;entiments, &s;ome of the Phari&s;ees thinking to intimidate him, and cau&s;e him to depart out of the country, came to him and pretended that Herod had a de&s;ign again&s;t his life. It is not likely that Herod, who had &s;uffered &s;o much remor&s;e on account of his having put John the Bapti&s;t to death, &s;hould &s;o &s;oon attempt the life of one who&s;e works declared him to be a greater pro|phet; perhaps, that prince might wi&s;h JESUS to depart out of his territories, though he dur&s;t not u&s;e force again&s;t him: nor is it unlikely that the Phari&s;ees were de&s;irous of his departure out of the country, becau&s;e his di&s;cour&s;es tended to expo&s;e their hypo|cri&s;y, and le&s;&s;en them in the opinion of the people. The an&s;wer which our great Re|deemer made to this me&s;&s;age, is contained in the following words: 'Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I ca&s;t out devils, and I do cures to-day, and to-morrow, and the third day I &s;hall be perfected. Neverthele&s;s, I mu&s;t walk to-day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be, that a prophet peri&s;h out of Jeru&s;alem.'</P>
<P>HAVING returned this an&s;wer to the Phari&s;ees, and con&s;idering the treatment which the prophets had met with from the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem, and well knowing the wickedne&s;s of that unbelieving city, and their de&s;igns again&s;t his life, he pathetically lamented their ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s, and the terrible de&s;olation which would &s;oon overtake them for their &s;ins; <HI>O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>which kille&s;t the prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them that are &s;ent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children toge|ther, as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your hou&s;e is left unto you de&s;olate; and verily I &s;ay unto you, Ye &s;hall not &s;ee me, until the time come, when ye &s;hall &s;ay, Ble&s;&s;ed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>ONE of the chief of the Phari&s;ees, &s;oon after our Lord had made this pathetic ex|clamation, invited him to his hou&s;e, to take a repa&s;t: JESUS well knew, that this invitation did not proceed from hearty good-will: but, as he never &s;hunned an op|portunity of doing good, even to his mo&s;t implacable enemies, he thought fit to ac|cept it. It was the Sabbath-day, and when he had entered the Phari&s;ee's hou&s;e, a man was brought before him who was di&s;ea&s;ed with a drop&s;y. The Phari&s;ees well knew the benevolent di&s;po&s;ition of our great Redeemer, and they thought &s;o mi&s;erable an object would not fail of exciting his compa&s;&s;ion, and cau&s;e him to work a miracle on that day, which would give them the opportunity of accu&s;ing him as a prophaner of the Sabbath. JESUS, who knew the &s;ecret thoughts of their hearts, a&s;ked the Phari&s;ees, and lawyers, whether it was <HI>lawful to heal on the Sabbath-day?</HI> But they refu&s;ing to give any an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, our Lord laid his hand on the di&s;ea&s;ed per|&s;on, and immediately his body was reduced to its former dimen&s;ions, and his health and &s;trength returned. So kind, &s;o &s;alutary and benevolent, as well as wonderful an action, ought to have convinced the Phari&s;ees, that the per&s;on who wrought it, mu&s;t be en|dowed with power from on high, as no le&s;s than the mighty power of God could pro|duce &s;uch events; or if they could &s;uppo&s;e that wicked agents had the power, that is not the way in which they might be expected to exert it; but the&s;e hypocritical wretches, in&s;tead of being per&s;uaded that JESUS was &s;ent from God, and exerted his miraculous powers for the good of mankind, were labouring to turn this miracle to his di&s;advantage. But our Lord &s;oon put an end to their wicked de&s;igns, by proving, that according to their own allowed practice, he had done nothing but what was lawful: <HI>Which of you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;hall have an a&s;s, or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not &s;traight|way pull him out on the Sabbath day?</HI> Our Lord's argument &s;tood thus, If a misfortune happens to one of your bea&s;ts, you make no &s;cruple of a&s;&s;i&s;ting it on the Sabbath, though the action be attended with con&s;iderable labour: and &s;urely, I may relieve a

de&s;cendant of Abraham, when nothing more is required, than touching him with my hand. This rea&s;oning was &s;o &s;trong, forcible, and conclu&s;ive, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;o &s;imple and ea&s;y, that the mo&s;t illiterate of mankind, mu&s;t &s;ee its propriety and feel its force, and the mo&s;t prejudiced could not contradict it. This was manife&s;t from the profound &s;ilence with which the&s;e remarks of our Lord were heard, and which con|tinued after he had done &s;peaking. None of his adver&s;aries, however inveterate their malice, or hot their re&s;entment, dur&s;t at this time appear again&s;t him, for they could not an&s;wer again to the&s;e things.</P>
<P>BEFORE they &s;at down to meat, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had an opportunity of remark|ing the pride of the Phari&s;ees, which manife&s;ted it&s;elf by an anxious and eager de&s;ire to obtain the mo&s;t honourable place at the table; nor did he fail, on this occa&s;ion, to give them &s;uch a rebuke, as their ridiculous behaviour de&s;erved. To make them &s;en&s;i|ble of their folly, our Lord called upon them to con&s;ider, that pride generally expo&s;es the per&s;on to frequent mortifications, and many affronts, while an humble deportment is a &s;ure way to honour and re&s;pect: 'When thou art bidden of any man to a wed|ding,' &s;aid he, '&s;it not down in the highe&s;t room; for le&s;t a more honourable man than thou be bidden, of him; and he that bade thee and him, come and &s;ay to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with &s;hame to take the lowe&s;t room. But when thou art bidden go and &s;it down in the lowe&s;t room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may &s;ay unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then &s;halt thou have wor&s;hip in the pre&s;ence of them that &s;it at meat with thee. For who&s;oever exalteth him&s;elf &s;hall be aba&s;ed; and he that humbleth him&s;elf &s;hall be exalted.'</P>
<P>HAVING directed this di&s;cour&s;e to the Phari&s;ees in general, our Lord turned to the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, and &s;aid unto him, 'When thou make&s;t a dinner, or a &s;upper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kin&s;men, nor thy rich neighbours. But when thou make&s;t a fea&s;t, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind:' limit not thy ho&s;pitality to the rich an great, but let the poor and needy be partakers of thy bounty: and thou &s;halt be ble&s;&s;ed, added our Lord, for they cannot recompen&s;e thee; but thou &s;halt be recompen&s;ed at the re&s;urrection of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>WHILE our Lord was thus di&s;cour&s;ing, one of the Phari&s;ees, &s;eeming to be ravi&s;hed with the delightful pro&s;pect of the happine&s;s which good men will enjoy in the hea|venly world, cried out, 'Ble&s;&s;ed is he that &s;hall eat bread in the kingdom of God.' Our Lord, in an&s;wer to this, took occa&s;ion to deliver to the company at the table, the para|ble of the marriage-&s;upper: 'A certain man,' &s;aid he, 'made a great &s;upper, and bade many; and &s;ent his &s;ervant at &s;upper-time, to &s;ay to them that were bidden, Come: for all things are now ready. And they all with one con&s;ent began to make excu&s;es. The fir&s;t &s;aid unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I mu&s;t needs go and &s;ee it: I pray thee have me excu&s;ed.

And the &s;ervant &s;aid, lord, it is done as thou ha&s;t commanded, and yet there is room.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had departed from the Phari&s;ee's hou&s;e, great multitude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of people thronged about him, to hear his doctrine, and to behold his wonder|ous works: but the people in general, mi&s;took the nature of his kingdom; for it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the general expectation that he was going to e&s;tabli&s;h the Me&s;&s;iah's throne in Jeru&s;alem, and from thence to conquer all the nations in the world, and render them tributary to his power.</P>
<P>As our Lord well knew that the people followed him with &s;uch expectations, he took the fir&s;t opportunity to undeceive them, and to declare in the plaine&s;t terms, that his kingdom was not of this world, and, of con&s;equence, tho&s;e who followed him for tem|poral advantage, would be &s;ure to find them&s;elves mi&s;taken; for, on the contrary, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;ciples mu&s;t expect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> be per&s;ecuted from city to city, and hated of all men for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> name's &s;ake.

per&s;ons of infamous lives, and abandoned characters, came among&s;t the crowds which pre&s;&s;ed to hear him. The&s;e per&s;ons, con&s;cious of their unworthine&s;s, approached our great Redeemer with the highe&s;t reverence, and heard him with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful and &s;teady attention. This opportunity was readily embraced by the great Saviour of &s;inners, who, far from upbraiding them with their former wickedne&s;s, or &s;purning them from him with contempt, kindly conde&s;cended to in&s;truct them in tho&s;e things which con|cerned their everla&s;ting peace, and not only taught them in the fields, but went with them to their hou&s;es, and kindly conde&s;cended to teach them the nature of his king|dom, and lead them in the way of eternal life and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS conde&s;cending goodne&s;s in our great Redeemer, was highly offen&s;ive to the proud, &s;elf-conceited, &s;elf-righteous Phari&s;ees; they wanted to be accepted on the foot|ing of their own unworthine&s;s, and could not bear the thoughts of the infinite mercy of God, manife&s;ted to the greate&s;t of &s;inners; and, therefore, with hearts full of envious pride, they advanced it as a ground of reproach again&s;t our great Redeemer, that this man receiveth &s;inners, and eateth with them. Their pride could not bear the thought, that the&s;e per&s;ons whom they &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;hould be looked upon by our Saviour with more kindne&s;s than them&s;elves; and they thought his conde&s;cention unworthy the character of a prophet. They had no other views of divine acceptance, than &s;uch as had an immediate reference to the law; and the infinite mercy of God to &s;inners, mani|fe&s;ted in the go&s;pel of his Son, was what they could not under&s;tand; our great Re|deemer therefore, to convince them of their ignorance, to check their abominable pride and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, to di&s;play the exten&s;ive and abundant mercy of God to &s;inful man, and to vindicate his own conduct, in conver&s;ing with the meane&s;t and mo&s;t contemptible per&s;ons, propo&s;ed three parables to their con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e parables was that of the lo&s;t &s;heep, which the Divine In&s;tructor delivered in the following words: 'What man of you, having an hundred &s;heep, if he lo&s;e one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderne&s;s, and go after that which is lo&s;t, until he find it? And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his &s;houlders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, &s;aying unto them, rejoice with me; for I have found my &s;heep which was lo&s;t:' Thus, by the natural turn of the human mind, which is re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y under the morti|fication of lo&s;ing part of its property, and fixes with &s;uch eager attention on that which it has lo&s;t, that it overlooks tho&s;e valuable objects which it has in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, our great Redeemer de&s;cribes the regard which God has to his people while they wander from him in a lo&s;t, peri&s;hing condition; and by the joy which expands the human heart, when that which had long been given up for lo&s;t, is recovered; our Lord di&s;plays the kind reception which the wor&s;t of &s;inners will find, when they are made &s;en&s;ible of their evil ways, and are enabled to believe in the Son of God for life and &s;alvation. And in this elegant, well-cho&s;en parable, he further de&s;cribes the joy of the heavenly inhabi|tants, when any of the &s;heep of Chri&s;t, who have long wandered from his fold, are convinced of their de&s;perate condition, humbled under a &s;en&s;e of their unworthine&s;s and wickedne&s;s, and are enabled to return: <HI>I &s;ay unto you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that likewi&s;e joy &s;hall be in heaven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver one &s;inner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine ju&s;t per&s;ons, that need no repentance.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is no per&s;on on earth &s;o ju&s;t and holy, and who&s;e conduct hath been &s;o regu|lar, and uniformly correct, as to need no repentance; but the proud Phari&s;ees, to whom our Lord directed the&s;e parables, would fain have been e&s;teemed by the world as &s;uch per&s;ons; and the&s;e are particularly referred to in this repre&s;entation, which was in|tended
<PB N="156" REF="029927_0162_0FE3379EC037E0B0">
to di&s;play the amazing and infinite extent of divine forgivne&s;s. A &s;econd para|ble which our great Redeemer publi&s;hed with the &s;ame view, was that of the lo&s;t piece of &s;ilver: 'Either,' &s;aid the divine in&s;tructor, 'what woman having ten pieces of &s;ilver, if &s;he lo&s;e one piece, doth not light a candle, and &s;weep the hou&s;e, and &s;earch diligently till &s;he find it? and when &s;he hath found it, &s;he calleth her friends and neighbours together, &s;aying, rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I have lo&s;t: Likewi&s;e, I &s;ay unto you, there is joy in the pre&s;ence of the angels of God over one &s;inner that repenteth.'</P>
<P>THIS parable is founded on the &s;ame principles, and publi&s;hed with the &s;ame de&s;ign as the former, only the ca&s;e and circum&s;tances are varied; and our great Redeemer conde&s;cends in various forms and methods of addre&s;s to inculcate the &s;ame truth. The infinite mercy of God to &s;inners, and the kind reception they will find, when they are enabled to repent and return, is the great doctrine which runs through his go&s;pel, and this is the great de&s;ign of all his undertakings; to accompli&s;h this, to remove every difficulty which attended it, to overcome and &s;ubdue every power which oppo&s;ed it, and to publi&s;h the glad-tidings to a &s;inful world, he left the glories of the heavenly regions, he laid a&s;ide the dignity and glory of his heavenly nature, and conde&s;cended to become man; he was a partaker of the evils con&s;equent on &s;in, that &s;inful men might be deliver|ed from them; he was <HI>a man of &s;orrows and acquainted with grief,</HI> that we might be par|takers of the &s;ub&s;tantial and eternal joy; and he died that we might live. To publi&s;h this great truth, and to prevail on the world to receive it, was the whole de&s;ign of his mini&s;try; every doctrine he advanced, every miracle which he wrought, had a natural tendency to promote this benevolent de&s;ign; and this great end, in various forms of in|&s;truction, and various methods of addre&s;s, he invariably pur&s;ued during the time of his abode on earth. And that no method of addre&s;s, no form of in&s;truction, might be omitted, which would powerfully operate on the mind and prepare it for the reception of a truth, &s;o worthy of God, &s;o friendly to man, our Lord conde&s;cended to appeal to the feelings of humanity; and from the natural affection which an offended father feels for a repenting &s;on, he urged the certainty and the extent of divine forgivne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE parable which our great Redeemer propo&s;ed with this view, is the fine&s;t picture of nature; it contains all the beauties of ju&s;t de&s;cription, and particularly calculated to engage the attention and affect the heart; the evangeli&s;t Luke hath given it in the following words: <HI>A certain man had two &s;ons: And the younger of them &s;aid to his Father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after, the younger &s;on gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wa&s;ted his &s;ub&s;tance with riotous living. And when he had &s;pent all, there aro&s;e a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined him&s;elf to a citizen of that country; and he &s;ent him into his fields to feed &s;wine. And he would fain have filled his belly with the hu&s;ks that the &s;wine did eat; and no man gave unto him. And when he came to him&s;elf, he &s;aid, how many hired &s;ervants of my father's have bread enough, and to &s;pare, and I peri&s;h with hunger! I will ari&s;e and go to my father, and I will &s;ay unto him, father, I have &s;inned again&s;t heaven, and before thee, and am no more wor|thy to be called thy &s;on: make me as one of thy hired &s;ervants. And he aro&s;e, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father &s;aw him, and had compa&s;&s;ion, and ran, and fell on his neck and ki&s;&s;ed him. And the &s;on &s;aid unto him, father, I have &s;inned again&s;t heaven, and in thy &s;ight, and am no more worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be called thy &s;on. But the fa|ther &s;aid to his &s;ervants, bring forth the be&s;t robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and &s;hoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: for this my &s;on was dead, and is alive again; he was lo&s;t, and is found. And they
<PB N="157" REF="029927_0163_0FE337AC248C9140">
began to be merry. Now his elde&s;t &s;on was in the field; and as he came and drew nigh to the hou&s;e, he heard mu&s;ic and dancing. And he called one of the &s;ervants, and a&s;ked what the&s;e things meant. And he &s;aid unto him, thy brother is come: and thy father hath killed the fat|ted calf, becau&s;e he hath received him &s;afe and &s;ound. And he was angry, and would not go in; therefore came his father out, and entreated him. And he an&s;wering &s;aid to his father, Lo, the&s;e many years do I &s;erve thee, neither tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed I at any time thy commandment, and yet thou never gave&s;t me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: but as &s;oon as this thy &s;on was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou ha&s;t killed for him the fatted calf. And he &s;aid unto him, &s;on, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. It was meet that we &s;hould make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lo&s;t, and is found.</HI> Luke xv.11. to the end.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ign of this parable is manife&s;ted at fir&s;t &s;ight, and &s;tands a beautiful and un|fading memorial of the fullne&s;s, the freene&s;s, and extent of divine mercy to the greate&s;t of &s;inners; it not only declares that it is the fixed determination of heaven to forgive, and that mercy is an e&s;&s;ential attribute of deity, the brighte&s;t &s;tar in the eternal crown; but it &s;hews that this glorious di&s;po&s;ition of heaven to forgive, entirely coincides with the feelings of humanity; for the eternal God conde&s;cends to appeal to that paternal ten|derne&s;s which he hath planted in the human brea&s;t, in vindication of his own conduct in pardoning &s;inners, and in explanation of the nature and extent of his mercy.</P>
<P>IF this parable be applied to the particular ca&s;e with which it &s;tands-connected, it con|tains a reproof which the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS directed to the Phari&s;ees for their murmuring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his conde&s;cending kindne&s;s to publicans and &s;inners; and hereby they are taught that if they would re&s;emble the holy and happy inhabitants of the cele&s;tial regions, they would not murmur and complain, and look down with envious pride, and &s;ullen contempt while he conver&s;ed with tho&s;e who were noted for being habitually and pre|vailingly wicked, but would rejoice to &s;ee &s;uch per&s;ons pur&s;ue tho&s;e methods which might tend to their reformation and final &s;alvation; nor would the gladne&s;s of heart they might expre&s;s on this occa&s;ion, be any reproach to that &s;trictne&s;s and purity which they value them&s;elves upon; 'for there is joy in heaven over one &s;inner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine ju&s;t per&s;ons which need no repentance.'</P>
<P>OUR Lord having thus vindicated his own conduct, in his conde&s;cending kindne&s;s to publicans and &s;inners, by &s;hewing the va&s;t extent of divine mercy, and the plea&s;ure which the happy inhabitants of the heavenly regions, take in the pardon of the wor&s;t of &s;inners, and their re&s;toration to divine favour; he then delivered a parable to impre&s;s on the minds of his hearers the nece&s;&s;ity of attending to the concerns of futurity. This he exemplified in the ca&s;e of the unju&s;t &s;teward, who being warned by his lord to give up his &s;teward&s;hip, took &s;uch mea&s;ures as were likely to procure him a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence when he had lo&s;t his pre&s;ent employment: 'There was,' &s;aid our great Redeemer, 'a certain rich man, which had a &s;teward; and the &s;ame was accu&s;ed unto him, that he had wa&s;ted his goods. And he called him, and &s;aid unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy &s;teward&s;hip; for thou maye&s;t be no longer &s;teward. Then the &s;teward &s;aid within him&s;elf, What &s;hall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the &s;teward&s;hip; I cannot dig; to beg I am a&s;hamed. I am re&s;olved what to do, that when I am put out of the &s;teward&s;hip, they may receive me into their hou&s;es. So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and &s;aid unto the fir&s;t, how much owe&s;t thou unto my lord? And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;aid, an hundred mea&s;ures of oil. And he &s;aid unto him, take thy bill, and &s;it down quickly, and write fifty. Then &s;aid he to another, and how much owe&s;t thou? And he &s;aid, an hundred mea&s;ures of wheat. And he &s;aid
<PB N="158" REF="029927_0164_0FE337ADF479CAC8">
unto him, take thy bill, and write four&s;core. And the lord commended the unju&s;t &s;tew|ard, becau&s;e he had done wi&s;ely: for the children of this world are wi&s;er in their gene|ration, than the children of light.' The &s;cope of our Lord's argument in this pa&s;&s;age, is apparently this: as a prudent thought for futurity, and a &s;teady pur&s;uit of tho&s;e means which tend to prevent apprehended evils, though tho&s;e means may not be ap|proved as lawful in them&s;elves, are &s;ufficient to denominate a per&s;on wi&s;e: with what earne&s;t attention, and unremitting application, ought tho&s;e who have eternity in view, to pur&s;ue the precepts of heavenly wi&s;dom, and to make all le&s;&s;er events &s;ub&s;ervient to the greater end of obtaining eternal happine&s;s: 'And I &s;ay unto you,' added our great Redeemer, 'make to your&s;elves friends of the mammon of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everla&s;ting habitations.'</P>
<P>THE Phari&s;ees, who&s;e hearts were &s;et upon the things of this world, and who had but very feeble and contracted views of eternal things, derided this doctrine of our great Redeemer; but he after giving them a &s;ea&s;onable reproof, produced by a &s;trik|ing and mo&s;t remarkable parable, to &s;hew the vanity of riches, and the va&s;t impor|tance of eternal things: 'There was,' &s;aid he, 'a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared &s;umptuou&s;ly every day. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of &s;ores, and de&s;iring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his &s;ores. And it came to pa&s;s, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bo&s;om: the rich man al&s;o died, and was buried; and in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and &s;eeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bo&s;om. And he cried, and &s;aid, father Abraham, have mercy on me, and &s;end Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham &s;aid, &s;on, remember that thou, in thy life-time received&s;t thy good things, and likewi&s;e Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted and thou art tormented. And be&s;ides all this, between us and you, there is a great gulph &s;ixed: &s;o that they which would pa&s;s from hence to you cannot: neither can they pa&s;s to us, that would come from thence. Then he &s;aid, I pray thee, therefore, father, that thou woulde&s;t &s;end him to my father's hou&s;e; for I have five brethren; that he may te&s;|tify unto them, le&s;t they al&s;o come into this place of torment. Abraham &s;aith unto him, they have Mo&s;es and the prophets; let them hear them. And he &s;aid, Nay, father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. And he &s;aid unto him, If they hear not Mo&s;es and the prophets, neither will they be per|&s;uaded, though one ro&s;e from the dead.'</P>
<P>THIS parable is the mo&s;t awful and alarming, and the mo&s;t fully demon&s;trative of the immortality of the &s;oul, and it's exi&s;tence in a &s;eparate &s;tate, of any we meet with in the &s;acred volume: the imagery is &s;o beautiful and it is drawn in &s;uch lively colours, that it has rather been looked upon as an hi&s;tory than a parable in all ages of the church; many of the mo&s;t affecting, the mo&s;t awful and important le&s;&s;ons may be learned from it, and &s;uch &s;entiments are here di&s;played, as are not to be found in any other part of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, we learn the &s;hortne&s;s and uncertainty of this pre&s;ent &s;tate, and how little the attainment of va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in this world, conduces to the be&s;t intere&s;t of mankind. We have here held up to our view, a rich man, in all the grandeur, glory, and profu&s;ion of oppulence, &s;urrounded with all the honours, and partaking of all the plea&s;ures which earth can give: <HI>The rich man's wealth,</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t of men informs us, <HI>is his &s;trong city: and as an high wall in his own conceit.</HI> The rich man thinks that his

riches entitle him to every honour, and to the participation of every thing which can be enjoyed: but how is he pained to find him&s;elf mo&s;t deplorably mi&s;taken, when the mind, &s;atiated with enjoyment, and &s;urfeited with plea&s;ure, grows &s;ick of delight; amid&s;t the abundance of riches, the &s;oul &s;tarves, it finds nothing that is con&s;i&s;tent with its &s;piritual nature, and would pine for want of &s;olid enjoyment in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a whole material world.</P>
<P>BUT how &s;hort and uncertain are tho&s;e &s;ickly joys, tho&s;e &s;urfeiting plea&s;ures which the rich man is able to partake of: <HI>The rich man,</HI> we are informed, <HI>died, and was buried.</HI> The pomp and pageantry, the luxury and all the con&s;equence in the world which riches give their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, will not enable him to face the great king of terrors, Death: and as the utmo&s;t profu&s;ion of riches, cannot enable their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to face the pale tyrant with compo&s;ure, neither can they bribe him to one moment's delay: <HI>No man hath power to retain the &s;pirit in the day of death:</HI> the &s;oul, all black and horrid with guilt, trembles at the approach of the eternal world, and with va&s;t amazement and terror, &s;trives to evade the awful &s;troke, but all in vain: <HI>there is no di&s;charge in that war:</HI> the ca&s;e admits of no refu&s;al or delay: the unhappy mortal falls, and all that his riches can do, is only to carry him with prodigious pomp and &s;plendour to the grave.</P>
<P>FROM this awful and affecting parable, we likewi&s;e learn the &s;tate of the dead, and the capacity of the &s;eparated &s;oul, to receive happine&s;s or mi&s;ery before the re&s;urrection of the body; <HI>The rich man died and was buried,</HI> we are informed, and what then? Did he enter into re&s;t, or did he remain in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility until the day of re&s;urrection? Nei|ther of the&s;e; but <HI>in hell he lifted up his eyes.</HI> The unhappy mortal's plea&s;ures and &s;en&s;ual gratifications are all pa&s;t; and now, all naked, defencele&s;s, and forlorn, he falls headlong into the depths of mi&s;ery and woe: the black regions of horror and de&s;pair are now his portion: he lies in inexpre&s;&s;ible torment, and, amid&s;t the&s;e fiery regions, &s;ees nothing but what tends to increa&s;e and aggravate his woes: <HI>He lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and &s;eeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bo&s;om.</HI> The poor beggar that lay at his gate, all covered with &s;ores, died and was buried, and in the du&s;t lo&s;t all his meanne&s;s, and was equal to the riche&s;t man on earth: there is no pre-eminence in the grave; <HI>for the &s;mall and great are there, and the &s;ervant is free from his ma&s;ter.</HI> But how great the difference between the poore&s;t &s;aint and riche&s;t &s;inner; Lazarus, at his death, was car|ried by angels into Abraham's bo&s;om, while the rich man de&s;cended into hell, and lift up his eyes in torment.</P>
<P>THUS having reprimanded the Phari&s;ees, he took occa&s;ion to &s;peak of affronts and offences, de&s;cribed their evil nature, and their dreadful puni&s;hment: 'It is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, but that offence will come: but woe unto him through whom they come. It were better for him that a mill&s;tone were hanged about his neck, and he ca&s;t into the &s;ea, than that he &s;hould offend one of the&s;e little ones.</P>
<P>OUR Lord &s;pake al&s;o again&s;t a quarrel&s;ome temper in his &s;ervants, e&s;pecially in the mini&s;ters and teachers of religion, pre&s;cribed a &s;ea&s;onable and prudent reprehen&s;ion of the fault, accompanied with forgivne&s;s on the per&s;on injured, as the be&s;t means of di&s;|arming the temptations that may ari&s;e from thence: 'Take heed to your&s;elves: if thy brother tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

<P>THIS di&s;cour&s;e on forgivne&s;s, uttered at a time when the Phari&s;ees had ju&s;t upbraided him, by called him a fal&s;e teacher, &s;ufficiently proves how truly he forgave them all the

<P>HOWEVER beautiful the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es of our Saviour appear, when examined with at|tention, they &s;eem to have &s;taggered the faith of his di&s;ciples and followers; perhaps they &s;till imagined, that he would &s;hortly erect a temporal kingdom, and di&s;tribute among them the rewards they expected for their &s;ervices.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Sickne&s;s and Death of Lazarus: <HI>JESUS</HI> receives an Account thereof; and, in his Way to Bethany, he heals ten Lepers in a Village of Samaria: He arrives at Bethany, and rai&s;eth Lazarus to Life, after he had been dead four Days: Many Jews believe: The Phari&s;ees hold a Council again&s;t <HI>JESUS</HI>: Caiphas prophe&s;ieth: <HI>JESUS</HI> retireth to Ephraim, a City on the Borders of the Wilderne&s;s, where he &s;heweth the &s;piritual Nature of the Kingdom of God, foretelleth the De&s;truction of the Jewi&s;h State, and in&s;tructeth his Di&s;ciples concerning the Coming of the Son of Man. <HI>JESUS</HI> delivers the Parable of the unju&s;t Judge, and importu|nate Widow, and that of the Phari&s;ee and the Publican: He an&s;wereth the Que&s;tion of the Phari&s;ees concerning Divorces: He receiveth the little Children with Tenderne&s;s, that were brought unto him, and ble&s;&s;eth them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SHORTLY after our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had fini&s;hed the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, one of his friends, named Lazarus, fell &s;ick at Bethany, a village two miles from Jeru&s;alem, but at a great di&s;tance from the countries beyond Jordon, where JESUS was now preaching the go&s;pel. The &s;i&s;ters of Lazarus, finding his &s;ickne&s;s was of a dangerous kind, thought proper to &s;end an account of it to JESUS; being firmly pur&s;uaded, that he who had cured &s;o many &s;trangers, would readily come and give health to one whom he loved in &s;o tender a manner; <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>behold he whom thou love&s;t is &s;ick:</HI> they did not add, come down and heal him, make ha&s;te and &s;ave him from the grave; it was &s;uf|ficient for them to propo&s;e their nece&s;&s;ities to their Lord, who was both able and wil|ling to help them in their di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>WHEN Je&s;us heard that, he &s;aid, this &s;ickne&s;s is not unto death;</HI> words which were doubt|le&s;s carried to Martha and Mary, and mu&s;t &s;trangely &s;urpri&s;e them, and exerci&s;e both their's and his di&s;ciples faith; &s;ince it is probable, that before the me&s;&s;enger arrived at Bethany, Lazarus had expired. Soon after, JESUS po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured his di&s;ciples, that Lazarus was dead.</P>
<P>ST. LUKE, in the beginning of his account, tells us, that JESUS loved Martha, and her &s;i&s;ter, and Lazarus; and that after he had received the me&s;&s;age, he abode two days
<PB N="161" REF="029927_0168_0FE337BDD79356E0">
in the &s;ame place where he was. His de&s;ign in this might be to in&s;inuate, that his lingering &s;o long after the me&s;&s;age came, did not proceed from a want of concern for his friends, but happened according to the coun&s;els of his own wi&s;dom: for the length of time which Lazarus lay in the grave, put his death beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, removed every &s;u&s;picion of fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and con&s;equently afforded JESUS a fit opportunity of di&s;playing the love he bore to Lazarus, as well as his own almighty power, in his un|doubted re&s;urrection from the dead. His &s;i&s;ters, indeed, were by this means kept a while in painful anxiety, on account of their brother's life, and at la&s;t were pierced by the &s;orrow of &s;eeing him die: yet they mu&s;t &s;urely think them&s;elves abundantly recompen|&s;ed, by the evidence accruing to the go&s;pel from this a&s;toni&s;hing miracle, as well as by the inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e of joy they felt, when they again had their brother re&s;tored from the dead.</P>
<P>AT the expiration of two days, JESUS &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, <HI>Let us go into Judea again,</HI> John xi.7. His di&s;ciples were a&s;toni&s;hed at this propo&s;al, and the recollection of his late danger in that country alarmed them: <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>the Jews of late thought to &s;tone thee; and goe&s;t though thither again?</HI> Wilt thou hazard thy life among&s;t tho&s;e who de&s;ired nothing more than to find an opportunity of killing thee? <HI>Je&s;us an&s;wered, are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day he &s;tumbleth not, becau&s;e he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth the light of this world: but if a man walk in the night, he &s;tumbleth, becau&s;e there is no light in him.</HI></P>
<P>THUS he intended to inform his di&s;ciples, that they had no rea&s;on to fear, &s;eeing his day was appointed, and the light of the Almighty was in him; that he could not &s;tumble nor fall, before the night of his pa&s;&s;ion approached, but that night was coming when no man could work. JESUS having thus removed their groundle&s;s apprehen&s;ions, and &s;trengthened their faith, that he might clearly explain to them the cau&s;e of his going into Judea again, told them, <HI>Our friend Lazarus &s;leepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of &s;leep.</HI> The di&s;ciples under&s;tanding his di&s;cour&s;e in a literal &s;en&s;e, re|plied, <HI>Lord, if he &s;leep, he &s;hall do well;</HI> his di&s;temper is abated, and he in all probabili|ty is recovering. It would be, therefore, highly unrea&s;onable in us to take two days journey only to awake him out of his &s;leep. Thus they covered their fears, and hinted to their Ma&s;ter, that it would be far &s;afer to continue where they were, than to take a hazardous journey into Judea. They were, however mi&s;taken: for the evange|li&s;t informs us, that he <HI>&s;pake of his death, but they thought, that he had &s;poken of taking re&s;t in &s;leep.</HI> JESUS, therefore, to remove any doubts, &s;aid plainly to them, <HI>Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for your &s;akes, that I was not there to the intent that you might believe:</HI> I am glad for your &s;akes, that I was not in Judea before he died; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had I been there, and re&s;tored him to his health, your faith in me, as the Me&s;&s;iah, mu&s;t have wanted the great confirmation it &s;hall now receive, by your beholding me rai&s;e him thus miraculou&s;ly from the dead.</P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST having thus given his di&s;ciples a proof of his divine knowledge, and of the de&s;igns of providence in the death of Lazarus, added, <HI>Neverthele&s;s let us go unto him.</HI> Thus JESUS, who could have rai&s;ed Lazarus without opening his lips, or ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, leaves his place of retirement beyond Jordan, and takes a long Journey into Judea, where the Jews lately attempted to kill him; becau&s;e his being pre&s;ent in per&s;on, and rai&s;ing Lazarus again to life, before &s;o many witne&s;&s;es at Bethany, where he died, and was &s;o well known, would be the means of bringing the men of that, and of future ages, to believe in his doctrine, &s;o well fitted to prepare them for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to eternal life; an admirable proof, as an emblem of which, he gave them in this miracle.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="029927_0169_0FE337BF5E76A908">OUR Lord having thus declared his re&s;olution of returning into Judea, and Thomas conceiving nothing le&s;s than de&s;truction from &s;uch a journey, yet unwilling to for&s;ake his Ma&s;ter, &s;aid, <HI>Let us al&s;o go that we may die with him.</HI> Let us not for&s;ake our Ma&s;ter in this dangerous journey, but accompany him into Judea, that if the Jews, who&s;e in|veteracy we are well acquainted with, &s;hould take away his life, we may al&s;o die with him.</P>
<P>THIS journey being thus re&s;olved on, JESUS departed with his di&s;ciples, and in his way to Bethany, pa&s;&s;ed through Samaria and Galilee: 'And as he entered into a cer|tain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which &s;tood afar off: and they lifted up their voices, and &s;aid, JESUS Ma&s;ter, have mercy on us. And when he &s;aw them, he &s;aid unto them, go &s;hew your&s;elves unto the prie&s;ts. And it came to pa&s;s, that as they went, they were clean&s;ed.' Luke xvii.12. &amp;c.</P>
<P>ONE of the&s;e mi&s;erable objects, was a native of the country, who perceiving that his cure was completed, came back prai&s;ing God for the great mercy he had received; he had before kept at a di&s;tance from our Saviour, but being now &s;en&s;ible that he was entirely clean, approached his benefactor, that all might have an opportunity of be|holding the miracle, and fell on his face at his feet, thanking him in the mo&s;t humble manner, for his conde&s;cen&s;ion in healing him of &s;o terrible a di&s;ea&s;e. JESUS, in order to intimate, that tho&s;e who were enlightened with the knowledge of the truth, ought at lea&s;t, to have &s;hewn as great a &s;en&s;e of piety and gratitude as this Samaritan, a&s;ked, 'were there not ten clean&s;ed, but where are the nine? There are not found that have returned to give glory to God, &s;ave this &s;tranger.'</P>
<P>OUR Saviour and his di&s;ciples now continued their journey towards Bethany, where he was informed by &s;ome of the inhabitants of that village, that Lazarus was not only dead, as he had foretold, but had now lain in the grave four days. The afflicted &s;i&s;ters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> overwhelmed with &s;orrow: &s;o that many of the Jews from Jeru&s;alem, came to comfort them on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT appears, the news of our Lord's coming, had reached Bethany before he arrived at that village; for Martha, the &s;i&s;ter of Lazarus, being informed of his approach, went out and met him, but Mary, who was of a more &s;edate and contemplative di&s;po&s;ition, fat &s;till in the hou&s;e. No &s;ooner was &s;he come into the pre&s;ence of JESUS, than, in ex|ce&s;s of grief &s;he poured forth her complaint: <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>if thou had&s;t been here, my brother had not died.</HI> If thou had&s;t complied with the me&s;&s;age we &s;ent thee, I well know that thy intere&s;t from heaven had prevailed, my brother had been cured of his di&s;ea&s;e, and delivere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the dark chambers of death.</P>
<P>MARTHA entertained a high opinion of our Saviour's power; &s;he believed that death did not dare to approach his pre&s;ence; and con&s;equently, if JESUS had arrived at Bethany before her brother's di&s;&s;olution, he had not fallen a victim to the king of ter|rors: but imagined, that it was not in his power to heal the &s;ick, at a di&s;tance, though, at the &s;ame time, &s;he &s;eemed to have &s;ome dark and imperfect hopes, that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord would &s;till do &s;omething for her; <HI>But I know,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>that even now, what&s;oever thou wilt a&s;k of God, God, will give it thee.</HI> She thought that JESUS could obtain what|&s;oever he de&s;ired by prayer, and therefore, did not found her hopes on his power, but on the power of God, through his interce&s;&s;ion. She doubtle&s;s knew, that the great Redeemer of mankind had rai&s;ed the daughter of Jarius, and the widow's &s;on of Nain, from the dead; but &s;eems to have con&s;idered her brother's re&s;urrection as much more difficult, becau&s;e he had been longer dead.</P>

<P><PB N="163" REF="029927_0171_0FE337C4A5BFF4A8">BUT our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who was willing to encourage this imperfect faith of Martha, an&s;wered, <HI>Thy brother &s;hall ri&s;e again.</HI> As the&s;e words were delivered in an indefinite &s;en&s;e, with regard to time, Martha under&s;tood them only as an argument of con&s;ola|tion, drawn from the general re&s;urrection, and accordingly an&s;wered, <HI>I know that he &s;hall ri&s;e again at the re&s;urrection at the la&s;t day.</HI> She was firmly per&s;uaded of that important article of the Chri&s;tian faith, <HI>the re&s;urrection of the dead;</HI> at which important hour &s;he believed her brother would ri&s;e from the chambers of the du&s;t. And here &s;he &s;eems to have terminated all her hopes, not thinking that the Son of God would now call her brother from the &s;leep of death. JESUS, therefore, to in&s;truct her in this great truth, replied, <HI>I am the re&s;urrection, and the life.</HI> I am the author of the re&s;urrection, the foun|tain and giver of that life they &s;hall then receive; and therefore can, with the &s;ame ea&s;e, rai&s;e the dead now as at the la&s;t day: <HI>He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet &s;hall he live: and who&s;oever liveth and believeth in me, &s;hall never die.

<P>SHE now &s;eemed to entertain &s;ome confu&s;ed expectations of her brother's immediate re&s;urrection; and leaving JESUS in the field, ran and called her &s;i&s;ter, according to his order, being willing that both Mary and her companions &s;hould be witne&s;&s;es of this great miracle.</P>
<P>MARY accordingly, no &s;ooner heard that JESUS was come, than &s;he immediately left her Jewi&s;h comforters, who only increa&s;ed the weight of her grief, and flew to her Saviour: and the Jews, who &s;u&s;pected &s;he was going to weep over the grave of her brother, followed her to that great prophet, who was going to remove all her &s;orrows. Thus the Jews, who came from Jeru&s;alem to comfort the two mournful &s;i&s;ters, were brought to the grave of Lazarus, and made witne&s;&s;es of his re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>MARY having approached the great Redeemer of mankind, fell pro&s;trate at his &s;ect, and in a flood of tears poured out her complaint, <HI>Lord, if thou had&s;t been here, my brother had not died.</HI> No wonder the compa&s;&s;ionate JESUS was moved at &s;o affecting a &s;cene: on this &s;ide &s;tood Martha pouring forth a flood of tears; at his feet lay the affectionate Mary weeping and lamenting her dear departed brother; while the Jews, who came to comfort the afflicted &s;i&s;ters, unable to confine their grief, joined the &s;olemn mourning, and mixed their friendly tears in witne&s;s of their love for the departed Lazarus, and in te&s;timony to the ju&s;tice of the &s;i&s;ters grief, for the lo&s;s of &s;o amiable, &s;o de&s;erving a brother. JESUS could not behold the affliction of the two &s;i&s;ters and their friends, without having a &s;hare in it him&s;elf; his heart was melted at the mournful &s;cene, <HI>he groaned in &s;pirit, and was troubled.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, to keep them no longer in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, he a&s;ked them, where they had buried Lazarus; not that he was ignorant where the body of the decea&s;ed was laid: he who knew that he was dead, when &s;o far di&s;tant from him, and could rai&s;e him up by a &s;ingle word, mu&s;t know where his remains were depo&s;ited: to which they an&s;wered, <HI>Lord, come and &s;ee.</HI> The Son of God, now to prove that he was not only God, but a mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate man, and to &s;hew us that the tender affections of a human heart, when kept in due bounds; that friendly &s;orrow, when not immoderate, and directed to proper ends, is con&s;i&s;tent with the highe&s;t &s;anctity of the &s;oul, joined in the general mourning: he wept, even at the time that he was going to give the mo&s;t ample proofs of his almighty power.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="029927_0172_0FE337C8D6A06B60">THUS the Jews were convinced that he loved Lazarus exceedingly; but &s;ome of them interpreted this circum&s;tance to his di&s;advantage: for, according to their mean way of judging, they fancied that he had &s;uffered him to fall by the &s;troke of death, for no other rea&s;on in the world, but for want of power to re&s;cue him. And thinking the miracle, &s;aid to have been wrought on the blind man, at the fea&s;t of tabernacles, at lea&s;t as difficult as the curing an accute di&s;temper, they called the former in que&s;tion, becau&s;e the latter had been neglected: <HI>Could not this man,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>which opened the eyes of the blind, have cau&s;ed that even this man &s;hould not have died?</HI></P>
<P>BUT JESUS took no notice of the&s;e que&s;tions; but grieving at the hardne&s;s of their hearts, and blindne&s;s of their infidelity, groaned again within him&s;elf, as he walked to|wards the &s;epulchre of the dead. At his coming to the grave, he &s;aid, <HI>Take ye away the &s;tone.</HI> To which Martha an&s;wered, <HI>Lord, by this time he &s;tinketh; for he hath been dead four days:</HI> or, as the pa&s;&s;age may be better rendered, hath lain in the grave four days. She meant to in&s;inuate that her brother's re&s;urrection was not to be expected. But JESUS gave her a &s;olemn reproof, to teach her that there was nothing impo&s;&s;ible with God; and that the power of the Almighty is not to be circum&s;cribed within the nar|row bounds of human rea&s;on, <HI>Said I not unto thee, that, if thou woulde&s;t believe, thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;ee the glory of God?</HI></P>
<P>Martha's objections being thus obviated, &s;he with the re&s;t, waited the great event in &s;ilence; and in pur&s;uance of the command of the Son of God, took away the &s;tone from the place where the dead was laid. JESUS had, on many occa&s;ions, publicly ap|pealed to his own miracles, as the proofs of his mi&s;&s;ion, though he did not generally make a formal addre&s;s to the Father before he worked this miracle; but being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w to rai&s;e Lazarus from the dead, he prayed for his re&s;urrection, to convince the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pectators that it could not be effected, without an immediate interpo&s;ition of the divine power: 'Father,' &s;aid he, 'I thank thee, that thou ha&s;t heard me; and I knew that thou heare&s;t me always: but becau&s;e of the people which &s;tand by, I &s;aid it, that they may believe that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me: I entertained no doubt of thy empowering me to do this mi|racle, and therefore, did not pray for my own &s;ake; I well knew that thou heare&s;t me always: I prayed for the &s;ake of the people, to convince them that thou love&s;t me, ha&s;t &s;ent me, and art continually owning the work I am come to do.</P>
<P>HAVING returned thanks to his Father, for this opportunity of di&s;playing his glory, <HI>He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</HI> This loud and efficacious call of the Son of God, awakened the dead; the breathle&s;s clay was in&s;tantly re-animated&punc; and he who had lain four days in the chambers of the tomb, obeyed immediately the power|ful &s;ound: 'And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin: JESUS &s;aith unto them, loo&s;e him and let him go.' It would have been the lea&s;t part of the miracle, had JESUS, by his powerful word, unloo&s;ed the napkins wherewith Lazarus was bound; but he brought him out in the &s;ame manner he was lying, and ordered the &s;pectators to loo&s;e him, that they might be better convinced of the miracle: for, in taking off the grave-clothes, they had the fulle&s;t evidence both of his death, and re&s;urrection. As on the one hand, the manner which he was &s;wathed, mu&s;t &s;oon have killed him, had he been alive when buried; and con&s;equently demon&s;trated, beyond all exception, that Lazarus had been dead &s;everal days, before JESUS called him again to life. Be&s;ides, in &s;tripping him, the linen offered, both to their eyes and &s;mell, abundant proofs of his putrifaction; and, by that means, convinced them that he had not been in a trance, but was really dead; on the other hand, by his lively countenance appearing, when the napkin was removed,
<PB N="165" REF="029927_0173_0FE337CA5D006870">
his fre&s;h colour, and his active vigour, they who came near and handled him, mu&s;t be convinced, that he was in perfect health, and had an opportunity of proving the truth of the miracle, by the clo&s;e&s;t examination. There is &s;omething extremely beautiful in our Lord's behaviour on this occa&s;ion; he did not utter one upbraiding word, either to the doubting &s;i&s;ters, or the malicious Jews, nor did he let fall one word of triumph or exultation: <HI>Loo&s;e him, and let him go,</HI> were the only words we have recorded: he was in this, as on all other occa&s;ions, con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, a pattern of perfect humility and &s;elf-denial.</P>
<P>SUCH was the ble&s;&s;ed work wrought by the Son of God at Bethany. And in the re&s;urrection of Lazarus, thus corrupted, and thus rai&s;ed by the powerful call of JESUS, we have a &s;triking emblem, and a glorious earne&s;t of the re&s;urrection of our bodies from the grave at the la&s;t day; when the &s;ame powerful mandate, which &s;poke Lazarus again into being, &s;hall collect the &s;cattered particles of our bodies, and rai&s;e them to life.</P>
<P>SO a&s;toni&s;hing a miracle performed in the neighbourhood of Jeru&s;alem, before a mul|titude of &s;pectators, many of them his enemies, could not fail of being the common topic of conver&s;ation, and of producing different effects upon different per&s;ons. Many believed that JESUS could be no other than the great Me&s;&s;iah &s;o long promi&s;ed; while others, who &s;till expected a temporal prince, and therefore unwilling to acknowledge him for their Saviour, were filled with indignation, particularly the chief prie&s;ts and elders. But this miracle, as well as all the re&s;t he had wrought in confirmation of his mi&s;&s;ion, was too evident to be denied; and, therefore, they pretended that his whole intention was to e&s;tabli&s;h a new &s;ect in religion, which would endanger both their church and nation: <HI>Then gathered the chief prie&s;ts and the Phari&s;ees a council,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>What do we? for this man doth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him; and the Romans &s;hall come and take away both our place and nation.</HI></P>
<P>THE common people, a&s;toni&s;hed at his miracles, will, if we do not take care to pre|vent it, certainly &s;et him up for the Me&s;&s;iah; and the Romans, under pretence of a rebellion, will deprive us both of our liberty and religion. Accordingly, they came to a re&s;olution to put him to death: this re&s;olution was not, however, unanimous; for Nicodemus, Jo&s;eph of Arimathea, and other di&s;ciples of our Saviour, then members of the council, urged the inju&s;tice of what they propo&s;ed to do, from the con&s;ideration of his miracles and innocence: but Caiaphas the high prie&s;t, from a principle of human policy, told them, that the nature of government often required certain acts of inju&s;|tice, in order to procure the &s;afety of the &s;tate: <HI>Ye know nothing at all, nor con&s;ider that it is expedient for us, that one man &s;hould die for the people, and that the whole nation peri&s;h not.</HI></P>
<P>THE council now having determined to put JESUS to death, deliberated, for the future, only upon the be&s;t methods of effecting it; and, in all likelihood, agreed to i&s;&s;ue a pro|clamation, promi&s;ing a reward to any per&s;on who would deliver him into their hands. For this rea&s;on, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour did not now go up to Jeru&s;alem, though he was within two miles of it; but returned to Ephraim, a city on the borders of the wilder|ne&s;s, where he abode with his di&s;ciples, being unwilling to go too far into the coun|try, becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;over, at which he was to &s;uffer, was at hand.</P>
<P>WHILE our Lord abode in Ephraim, the Phari&s;ees a&s;ked him, when the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah was to begin. We have more than once ob&s;erved, that the Jews had very
<PB N="166" REF="029927_0174_0FE337CBE29B96B0">
grand ideas of the kingdom they expected this great Son of David would e&s;tabli&s;h, the number of his &s;ubjects, the &s;trength of his armies, and the pomp and magnifi|cence of his court. It is therefore no wonder, that they were very de&s;irous of having that empire &s;peedily erected: but our Saviour, to correct this mi&s;taken notion, told them, that the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom did not con&s;i&s;t in any external pomp of government, erected in &s;ome particular country, by the terror of arms, and de&s;olation of war; but in the &s;ubjection of the minds of men, and in rendering them conformable to the laws of the Almighty, which was to be effected by a new di&s;pen&s;ation of religion, and this di&s;pen&s;ation was already begun. It was therefore needle&s;s for them to &s;eek in this or that place for the kingdom of God, as it had been already preached among them by CHRIST and his apo&s;tles, and confirmed by innumerable miracles: <HI>The kingdom of God,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>cometh not with ob&s;ervation: neither &s;hall they &s;ay, Lo here! or, Lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you,</HI> Luke xvii.20. &amp;c.</P>
<P>SOON after &s;peaking the&s;e words to the Phari&s;ees, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his di&s;ci|ples, and, in the hearing of the people, prophe&s;ied the de&s;truction of the Jewi&s;h &s;tate: who&s;e con&s;titution, both religious and civil, was the chief difficulty that oppo&s;ed the erection of his kingdom: but becau&s;e love and compa&s;&s;ion were eminent parts of our Saviour's temper, he mentioned that dreadful cata&s;trophe in &s;uch a manner, as might tend to the reformation and profit of his hearers. He informed them, that the pre|lude to this final de&s;truction would be an univer&s;al di&s;tre&s;s; when they &s;hould pa&s;&s;ion|ately wi&s;h for the per&s;onal pre&s;ence of the Me&s;&s;iah to comfort them, but would be denied their reque&s;t: 'The days will come, when ye &s;hall de&s;ire to &s;ee one of the days of the Son of man, and ye &s;hall not &s;ee it.' He next cautioned them again&s;t de|ceivers, which in this time of affliction, would endeavour to draw the people after them, in order to &s;upport their own power: <HI>And they &s;hall &s;ay to you, &s;ee here: or, &s;ee there: go not after them, nor follow them. For as the lightening that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, &s;hineth unto the other part under heaven; &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the Son of man be in his day. But fir&s;t mu&s;t he &s;uffer many things, and be rejected of this generation:</HI></P>
<P>BUT the coming of the Son of man &s;hall be &s;udden and unexpected: he will come in his own &s;trength, and with great power; he will throw down all oppo&s;ition, de&s;troy his enemies with &s;wift de&s;truction, and e&s;tabli&s;h his religion and government in a great part of the world, as &s;uddenly as lightening darts from one part of the heaven to the other: <HI>but before the&s;e things come to pa&s;s, he mu&s;t &s;uffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.</HI></P>
<P>AND, notwith&s;tanding this &s;udden de&s;truction and calamity that was to overwhelm the Jews, he told them their &s;tupidity would be like that of the old world, at the time of the deluge, or that of Sodom before the city was de&s;troyed: <HI>And as it was in the days of Noe, &s;o &s;hall it be al&s;o in the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives; they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came and de&s;troyed them all. Likewi&s;e al&s;o as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they &s;old, they planted, they builded: but the &s;ame day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brim&s;tone from heaven, and de&s;troyed them all. Even thus &s;hall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. In that day, he which &s;hall be upon the hou&s;e-top, and his &s;tuff in the hou&s;e, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewi&s;e not return back. Remember Lot's wife.</HI></P>
<P>A better example than that of Lot's wife could not have been produced: for if any of his hearers, through an immoderate love of the world, &s;hould be prevailed on,

in order to &s;ave their goods, after they were admoni&s;hed from heaven of their danger, by the &s;igns which progno&s;ticated the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem; or if any of them, through want of faith, &s;hould think, that the calamities predicted to fall on the na|tion, would not be either &s;o great or &s;udden as he had declared, and did not u&s;e the precaution of a &s;peedy flight; they might behold in Lot's wife an example both of their &s;in, and of their puni&s;hment: he added, that tho&s;e who endeavoured to &s;ave their lives, by flying into the city, &s;hould meet the de&s;truction they were endeavouring to avoid; whereas, tho&s;e who retired into the open towns and defencele&s;s villages, &s;hould be &s;afe: 'Who&s;oever &s;hall &s;eek to &s;ave his life, &s;hall lo&s;e it; and who&s;oever lo&s;e his life &s;hall pre&s;erve it.'</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Lord, after making the&s;e predictions, &s;pake the following parable, in order to excite them to a con&s;tant per&s;everance in prayer, and not to be &s;o weary and faint in their minds, as to neglect this nece&s;&s;ary duty.</P>
<P>THERE was in a city, &s;aid our Lord, a judge, who, being governed by athei&s;tical prin|ciples, had no regard to the precepts of religion; and, being very powerful, did not regard what was &s;aid of him by man: &s;o that all his deci&s;ions were influenced merely by pa&s;&s;ion or intere&s;t. In the &s;ame city was al&s;o a widow, who having no friends to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, was ab&s;olutely unable to defend her&s;elf from injuries, or procure redre&s;s for any &s;he had received. In this deplorable &s;ituation, &s;he had recour&s;e to the unju&s;t judge, in order to obtain &s;atisfaction for &s;ome oppre&s;&s;ive wrong &s;he had lately received: but the judge was &s;o abandoned to plea&s;ure, that he refu&s;ed, for a time, to li&s;ten to her reque&s;t; he would not give him&s;elf the trouble to examine her ca&s;e, though the crying inju&s;tice pleaded &s;o powerfully for this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed widow. She was not however, intimidated by his refu|&s;al: &s;he ince&s;&s;antly importuned him, till, by repeated repre&s;entations of her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he filled his mind with &s;uch di&s;plea&s;ing ideas, that he was obliged to do her ju&s;tice, merely to free him&s;elf from her importunity: <HI>Though,</HI> &s;aid he to him&s;elf, <HI>I fear not God, nor re|gard man; yet, becau&s;e this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her; le&s;t, by her continual com|ing, &s;he weary me.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;entiment, conveyed by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord in this parable, is very beautiful: we hence learn, that the cries of the afflicted will, by being ince&s;&s;antly repeated, make an impre&s;&s;ion, even on the &s;tony hearts of wicked men, who glory in ther impiety and laugh at all the precepts of ju&s;tice, virtue, and religion; and, therefore, cannot fail of being re|garded by the benevolent Father of the univer&s;e, who will li&s;ten to the petitions of his faithful &s;ervants, and pour on them the choice&s;t of his ble&s;&s;ings. <HI>Hear,</HI> &s;aid our gracious Lord, <HI>what the unju&s;t judge &s;aith. And &s;hall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them &s;peedily.</HI> Arguments of this kind, taken from the feeble goodne&s;s, or even from the imperfec|tions of men, to illu&s;trate the &s;uperior and infinite perfections of the Almighty were often made u&s;e of by the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, and with great &s;ucce&s;s in working the convic|tion de&s;igned. It was indeed hardly po&s;&s;ible to with&s;tand &s;uch powerful appeals; they force their way directly into mens' hearts, bear down all oppo&s;ition, and make a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on mens' minds.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Lord having thus enforced the duty of prayer, in this expre&s;&s;ive para|ble, a&s;ked the following oppo&s;ite que&s;tion, <HI>Neverthele&s;s, when the Son of man cometh, &s;hall he find faith on the earth?</HI> As if he had &s;aid, notwith&s;tanding all the miracles I have wrought, and the excellent doctrines I have delivered, &s;hall I find at my &s;econd coming,
<PB N="168" REF="029927_0176_0FE337D8842D1B68">
the faith among the children of men, there is rea&s;on to expect? Will not mo&s;t of them be found to have abandoned the faith, and wantonly a&s;k, <HI>Where is the promi&s;e of his coming?</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord having delivered the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es to the Phari&s;ees, who were righteous in their own conceit, and de&s;pi&s;ed others: but as the&s;e particulars are better illu&s;trated by their oppo&s;ites, he placed the character of this &s;pecies of men, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of the humble, de&s;cribing the reception each cla&s;s met with from the Almighty, in the parable of the Phari&s;ee and publican, who went up together to the temple at the time when the &s;acrifice was offered, to direct their petitions to the God of their fathers.</P>
<P>THE Phari&s;ee, having a great opinion of his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, went far into the court of the temple, that he might be as near the place of the divine re&s;idence as po&s;&s;ible: here he offered his prayer, giving God the prai&s;e of his &s;uppo&s;ed righteou&s;|ne&s;s; and had he been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any, he would have acted properly: 'God,' &s;aid he, 'I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unju&s;t, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fa&s;t twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s.' Having thus commended him&s;elf to God, he wrapped him&s;elf up in his own righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and giving the poor publican a &s;cornful look, walked away, perhaps to tran&s;gre&s;s &s;ome of the weightier matters of the law, judgment, ju&s;tice, and truth, and to devour the hou&s;es of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed widows and helple&s;s orphans. But how different was the be|haviour of the humble publican! Impre&s;&s;ed with a deep &s;en&s;e of his own unworthine&s;s, he would not even enter the courts of the temple, but &s;tanding afar off, he &s;mote upon his brea&s;t, and in the bitterne&s;s of his &s;oul, earne&s;tly implored the mercy of omnipo|tence: 'And the publican, &s;tanding afar off, would not lift up &s;o much as his eyes unto heaven, but &s;mote upon his brea&s;t, &s;aying, God, be merciful to me a &s;inner.'</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Lord added, I tell you, however ye may judge from external appearances, and whatever preference ye may give to this haughty Phari&s;ee; I, who know and &s;ee the heart, declare unto you, that the publican retired from the temple accepted by his God, and ble&s;&s;ed with the mercy which he im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ored, while the proud Phari&s;ee was di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent parable &s;ufficiently indicates, that all the &s;ons of men &s;tand in need of mercy; both the &s;trict Phari&s;ee and the de&s;pi&s;ed publican, with the whole race of man|kind, are &s;inners; and con&s;equently all mu&s;t inplore pardon of their benevolent Creator: we mu&s;t all a&s;cend to the temple, and there pour forth our prayers before the throne of grace; for there he has promi&s;ed ever to be pre&s;ent, to grant the petitions of all who a&s;k with &s;incerity and truth.</P>
<P>THESE parables were &s;poken in the town of Ephraim; and during our Lord's con|tinuance in that city, the Phari&s;ees a&s;ked him, Whether he thought it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cau&s;e? Our Saviour had twice before declared his opinion of this particular, once in Galilee, and once in Perea: it is therefore probable, that the Phari&s;ees were not ignorant of his &s;entiments, and that they a&s;ked the que&s;tion then, to find an opportunity of increa&s;ing the people again&s;t him, well knowing that the I&s;raelites held the liberty which the law gave them of divorcing their wives as one of their chief privileges: but however that be, JESUS was far from fearing the popular re&s;entment, and accordingly declared the third time again&s;t arbitrary divorces. The Phari&s;ees then a&s;ked him why they were commanded by Mo&s;es to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? In&s;inuating, that Mo&s;es was &s;o tender of their happine&s;s, that he gave them
<PB N="169" REF="029927_0177_0FE337DA0B6ED588">
liberty of putting away their wives, when they &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> occa&s;ion. To which JESUS an&s;wered, <HI>Becau&s;e of the hardne&s;s of your hearts, Mo&s;es &s;uffered you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not &s;o:</HI> as unlimited divorces were not permitted in the &s;tate of innocence, &s;o neither &s;hall they be under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>AND I &s;ay unto you, Who&s;oever &s;hall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and &s;hall marry another, comitteth adultery: and who&s;e marrieth her which is put away, doth com|mit adultery.</HI></P>
<P>AT which deci&s;ion the di&s;ciples were greatly &s;urpri&s;ed; and though they held their peace while the Phari&s;ees were pre&s;ent, yet they did not fail to a&s;k our Lord the rea&s;on on which he founded his determination, when they were returned home: And in the hou&s;e his di&s;ciples a&s;ked him again of the &s;ame matter. And he &s;aith unto them, 'Who&s;oever &s;hall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery again&s;t her. And if a woman &s;hall put away her hu&s;band, and be married to another, &s;he committeth adultery.'</P>
<P>UNLIMITED divorces being prevalent among the Jews, gave great encouragement to family quarrels, were very de&s;tructive of happine&s;s, and hindered the education of their tender offspring; be&s;ides, it greatly tended to make their children lo&s;e that reverence for them which is due to parents, as it was hardly po&s;&s;ible for the children to avoid engaging in the quarrel. Our Saviour's prohibition, therefore, of the&s;e divorces is founded on the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons, and greatly tends to promote the welfare of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>OUR Lord having, in the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try, performed innumerable cures in different parts of the country, &s;everal per&s;ons thinking, perhaps, that his power would be as great in preventing as in removing di&s;tempers, brought their children to him, de&s;iring that he would put his hands upon them and ble&s;s them. The di&s;ciples, how|ever, mi&s;taking the intention, were angry with the per&s;ons, and rebuked them, for en|deavouring to give this trouble to their Ma&s;ter. But JESUS no &s;ooner &s;aw it, than he was greatly di&s;plea&s;ed with his di&s;ciples and ordered them not to hinder parents from bringing their chlidren to him: 'S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of &s;uch is the kingdom of God.' That is, the church militant on earth, and that triumphant in heaven, are compo&s;ed of per&s;ons who re&s;emble little children in humility and meekne&s;s. Accordingly, taking them up in his arms, he ble&s;&s;ed them with his u&s;ual benevolence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER. XXVI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CHRIST</HI> departs from Ephraim, and, in his Journey to Jeru&s;alem by the Way of Jericho, he in&s;tructeth a young Man how to attain eternal Life, and how to become perfect: He &s;heweth how hard it is for a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God; and promi&s;eth great Re|wards to his Di&s;ciples, and to all who have for&s;aken ought to follow him: He delivers the Parable of the Labourers, who were hired at different Hours to work in the Vineyard: He foretelleth his own Death, and Re&s;urrection; and putteth by the ambitious Suit of the Sons of Zebedee.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE time of our dear Lord's pa&s;&s;ion drawing near, he departed from Ephraim, and repaired by the way of Jericho, towards Jeru&s;alem: but before he arrived at Jericho, a ruler of the &s;ynagogue came running to him, and kneeling down before him,
<PB N="170" REF="029927_0178_0FE337DB90DBE330">
a&s;ked him, 'Good Ma&s;ter, what good thing &s;hall I do, that I may have eternal life? Mat. xix.16. Though this young ruler pretended to pay great honour to our dear Redeemer, yet the whole was no more than a piece of hypocri&s;y: for though he &s;tyled him good, yet he did not believe that he was &s;ent from God, as &s;ufficiently appears from his refu&s;ing to ob&s;erve the coun&s;el given him by JESUS; nor could his artful in|&s;inuations e&s;cape the piercing eye of the great Saviour of the world; he well knew his &s;ecret intentions, and beheld the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of his &s;oul; and accordingly re|buked him for his hypocritical addre&s;s, before he an&s;wered his que&s;tion: <HI>Why calle&s;t thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God.</HI> But as he had de&s;ired the advice of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who never refu&s;ed it to any of the &s;ons of men, he readily an&s;wered his que&s;tion, by telling him, that he mu&s;t ob&s;erve all the moral precepts of the law; there being a nece&s;&s;ary connection between the duties of piety towards the Almighty, and of ju&s;tice and temperance towards men, the latter of which, were much more difficult to counterfeit than the former; 'If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He &s;aith unto him, Which? JESUS &s;aid, Thou &s;halt do no murder, Thou &s;halt not commit adultery, Thou &s;halt not &s;teal, Thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. The young man &s;aith unto him, All the&s;e things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?'</P>
<P>THESE commandments were, doubtle&s;s, under&s;tood by the young ruler, in the vague &s;en&s;e put upon them by the doctors and interpreters of the law; and, therefore, the character he here gave of him&s;elf might be very ju&s;t: for, though he was far from being a per&s;on of true probity and virtue, he might have appeared, in the &s;ight of men, as a per&s;on of a very fair character: and having maintained that character, not|with&s;tanding his great riches, he certainly de&s;erved commendation; and therefore, might be loved by that benevolent per&s;on who left the bo&s;om of his Father, to redeem lo&s;t mankind: but he was, at the &s;ame time, very faulty with regard to his love of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, a &s;in which might have e&s;caped even his own ob&s;ervation, though it could not e&s;cape the all-&s;eeing eye of the Son of God. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, there|fore, willing to make him &s;en&s;ible of this &s;ecret de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the riches of this world, told him, that if he aimed at perfection, he &s;hould di&s;tribute his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions among the poor and indigent, and become his di&s;ciple: <HI>If thou wilt be perfect, go and &s;ell that thou ha&s;t, and give to the poor, and thou &s;halt have trea&s;ure in heaven: and come and follow me.</HI></P>
<P>THE young man did not expect this condition, he was a&s;toni&s;hed at it, and without making the lea&s;t reply, retired, filled with &s;orrow, being very unwilling to part with his large e&s;tates: <HI>But when the young man heard that &s;aying, he went away &s;orrowful, for he had great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>THE pernicious influence of riches over the minds of the children of men, being thus melancholy in&s;tanced, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour cautioned his di&s;ciples again&s;t fixing their minds on things of &s;uch dangerous tendency, by &s;hewing how very difficult it was for a rich man to procure an habitation in the region of eternal happine&s;s: 'Verily I &s;ay unto you, That a rich man &s;hall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again I &s;ay unto you, it is ea&s;ier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When his di&s;ciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, &s;aying, who then can be &s;aved? But JESUS beheld them, and &s;aid unto them, with men this is impo&s;&s;ible; but with God all things are po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="029927_0179_0FE337E61A87EE60">BY this it appears, that if man be not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the grace of God, it will be impo&s;&s;i|ble for him to obtain the happy rewards of the kingdom of heaven; but, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of grace, which the Almighty never refu&s;es to tho&s;e who &s;eek it with their whole heart, it is very po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>BUT the di&s;ciples of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord were far from being &s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, as they had doubtle&s;s, often reflected with plea&s;ure on the high po&s;ts they were to enjoy in their Ma&s;ter's kingdom. Peter &s;eems particularly to have been di&s;appointed; and therefore addre&s;&s;ed his Ma&s;ter in the name of the re&s;t, begging him to remember, that his apo&s;tles had actually done what the young man had refu&s;ed: they had abandoned their relations, their friends, their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and their employments, on his account: and, therefore, de&s;ired to know what reward they were to expect, for the&s;e in&s;tances of their obedience. To which JESUS replied, that they &s;hould not fail of a reward, even in this life: for immediately after his re&s;urrection, when he a&s;cended to his Father, and en|tered on his mediatorial office, they &s;hould be advanced to the honour of judging the twelve tribes of I&s;rael; that is, of ruling the church of CHRIST, which they were to plant in dif|ferent parts of the earth; <HI>Verily I &s;ay unto you, that ye which have followed me in the re|generation, when the Son of man &s;hall &s;it in the throne of his glory, ye al&s;o &s;hall &s;it upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord having given this an&s;wer to Peter, he next mentioned the rewards his other di&s;ciples &s;hould receive, both in this world, and in that which is to come: they, &s;aid he, who have for&s;aken all for my &s;ake, &s;hall be no loo&s;ers in the end; their benevolent Fa|ther, who intends to give them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the heavenly Canaan, will not fail to &s;up|port them, during their long and painful journey to that happy country, and rai&s;e them up friends who &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t them with tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries they might have expected from their relations, had they not left them for my &s;ake. Divine Providence will take care that they have every thing valuable that can be given them by their relations, or they could de&s;ire from large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: they &s;hall, indeed, be fed with the bread of &s;orrow, but this &s;hall produce joys, to which all the earthly plea&s;ures bear no proportion; and, in the end, obtain everla&s;ting life: they &s;hall leave this vale of tears, with all its pains and &s;orrows, behind them, and fly to the bo&s;om of their Almighty Father, the fountain of life and joy, where, for all the &s;ufferings they have undergone in this world, they &s;hall be infinitely rewarded.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to this, many who are by their fellow-mortals, con&s;idered as the la&s;t of mankind, becau&s;e of their &s;ufferings, &s;elf-denials, and mortifications, &s;hall be really fir&s;t, not only in point of future reward, but even with regard to pre&s;ent &s;atisfaction: <HI>But many that are fir&s;t &s;hall be la&s;t; and the la&s;t &s;hall be fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>IT &s;eems the&s;e words were &s;poken to keep the di&s;ciples humble, as, in all probability, they at fir&s;t under&s;tood the promi&s;e of their &s;itting on twelve thrones in a natural &s;en&s;e; &s;o they were ready to con&s;true every expre&s;&s;ion to a temporal kingdom, which they &s;till expected their Ma&s;ter would erect upon earth. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, therefore, to remove all thoughts they might entertain of this kind, told them, that though he had de&s;cribed the rewards they were to expect for the ready obedience they had &s;hewn to his commands, and the pains they were to take in propagating the go&s;pel among&s;t the chil|dren of men; yet the&s;e rewards were &s;piritual, and not confined to the Jews alone, but extended al&s;o to the Gentiles, who, in point of time, &s;hould excel the Jews, and uni|ver&s;ally embrace the go&s;pel before that nation was converted.</P>
<P>OUR great Redeemer illu&s;trated this doctrine with the parable of the hou&s;e-holder, who at different hours of the day, hired labourers to work in his vineyard: 'The king|dom
<PB N="172" REF="029927_0180_0FE337E79DAF7108">
of heaven, &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, is like unto a man that is an hou&s;e-holder, which went out early in the morning, to hire labourers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he &s;ent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour, and &s;aw others &s;tanding idle in the market place, and &s;aid unto them, go ye al&s;o into the vineyard, and what&s;oever is right, I will give you. And they went their way. Again he went out about the &s;ixth and ninth hour, and did likewi&s;e. And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others &s;tanding, &s;aith unto them, why &s;tand ye here all the day idle? They &s;ay unto him, becau&s;e no man hath hired us. He &s;aid unto them, Go ye al&s;o into the vineyard; and what&s;oever is right, that &s;hall ye receive. So, when even was come, the lord of the vineyard &s;aid unto his &s;teward, call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the la&s;t unto the fir&s;t. And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they re|ceived every man a penny. But when the fir&s;t came, they &s;uppo&s;ed that they &s;hould have received more; and they likewi&s;e received every man a penny. And when they had received it, they murmured again&s;t the good man of hou&s;e, &s;aying, the&s;e la&s;t have wrought but one hour, and thou ha&s;t made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. But he an&s;wered one of them, and &s;aid, Friend, I do the no wrong; did&s;t not thou agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this la&s;t, even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, becau&s;e I am good? So the la&s;t &s;hall be fir&s;t, and the fir&s;t la&s;t: for many be called, but few cho&s;en,' Matt. xx.1&mdash;16.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour delivered the parable of the hou&s;e-holder in &s;uch a manner, as, from the application he has made of it, it would not be difficult to interpret it. The di&s;|pen&s;ations of religion, which God gave to mankind in different parts of the world, are repre&s;ented by the vineyard: the Jews, who were early members of the true church, and obliged to obey the law of Mo&s;es, are the labourers which the hou&s;e-holder hired early in the morning; the Gentiles, who were converted at &s;everal times, by the various inter|po&s;itions of Providence, to the knowledge and wor&s;hip of the true God, are the labourers hired at the third, &s;ixth, and ninth hour: and the invitation given at the eleventh hour, implies the calling of the Gentiles in every country, to live piou&s;ly and virtuou&s;ly. The law of Mo&s;es was a heavy yoke; and therefore, the obedience to its precepts was very elegantly repre&s;ented, by bearing the heat and burden of the whole day: but the pro|&s;elyted Gentiles paid obedience only to &s;ome particular precepts of the law, bore but part of its weight, and were, therefore, repre&s;ented by tho&s;e who were hired, at the third, &s;ixth, and ninth hours; while tho&s;e Heathens, who regulated their conduct by the law of nature only, and e&s;teemed the works of ju&s;tice, piety, temperance and charity, as their whole duty, are beautifully repre&s;ented as labouring in the cool of the evening, only one hour.</P>
<P>THE time being come when each labourer was to receive his wages, they were all pla|ced on an equal footing; the&s;e rewards being the privileges and advantages of the go&s;pel. The Jews who had borne the grievous yoke of the Mo&s;aic ceremonies, murmured when they found the Gentiles were admitted to its privileges, without being &s;ubject to their ceremonial wor&s;hip: but we mu&s;t not urge the circum&s;tance of the reward, &s;o far as to fancy that either Jews or Gentiles merited the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel, by their having laboured faithfully in the vineyard, or having behaved well under their &s;everal di&s;pen&s;a|tions. The go&s;pel, with its ble&s;&s;ings, was be&s;towed entirely by the free grace of God, and without any thing in men to merit it; be&s;ides, it was offered promi&s;cuou&s;ly to all, whether good or bad, and was embraced by per&s;ons of all character.

<P><PB N="173" REF="029927_0181_0FE337E92B3B2B50">OUR Lord having fini&s;hed the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, he continued his journey towards Jeru&s;alem, where the chief prie&s;ts and elders, &s;oon after the re&s;urrection of Lazarus, i&s;&s;ued a pro|clamation, promi&s;ing a reward to any one who &s;hould apprehend him. In all probabi|lity, this was the rea&s;on why the di&s;ciples were a&s;toni&s;hed at the alacrity of our Lord during this journey, while they them&s;elves followed him trembling, JESUS, therefore, thought proper to repeat the prophecies concerning his &s;ufferings, in order to &s;hew his di&s;ciples that they were entirely voluntary, adding that though the Jews &s;hould put him to death, yet in&s;tead of weakening, it &s;hould increa&s;e their faith, e&s;pecially as he would ri&s;e again the third day from the dead: <HI>Behold, we go up to Jeru&s;alem; and all things that are written by the prophets, concerning the Son of man, &s;hall be accompli&s;hed: for he &s;hall be delivered to the Gentiles, and &s;hall be mocked, and &s;pitefully entreated, and &s;pitted on: and they &s;hall &s;courge him, and put him to death: and the third day he &s;hall ri&s;e again,</HI> Luke xviii.31, 32, 33.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t have given the greate&s;t encouragement to out Lord's di&s;ciples, had they un|der&s;tood and applied this prediction which was built upon the ancient prophecies, in a proper manner; but they were &s;o ignorant in the &s;criptures, that they had no idea of what he meant: <HI>And they under&s;tood none of the&s;e things: and this &s;aying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were &s;poken.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the &s;ons of Zebedee were &s;o ignorant, that they thought their Ma&s;ter, by his telling them he would ri&s;e again from the dead, meant that he would then erect his empire; and, accordingly, begged that he would confer on them the chief po&s;ts in his kingdom, which they expre&s;&s;ed, by de&s;iring to be &s;eated, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left, in allu&s;ion to his placing the twelve apo&s;tles upon twelve thrones, judging the tribes of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>EVER &s;ince our Saviour's transfiguration, the &s;ons of Zebedee had conceived very high notions of his kingdom, and po&s;&s;ibly of their own merit al&s;o, becau&s;e they had been admitted to behold that miracle; but JESUS told them, they were ignorant of the nature of the honour they reque&s;ted; and &s;ince they de&s;ired to &s;hare with him in his glory, a&s;ked them, if they were willing to &s;hare with him al&s;o in his &s;ufferings: 'Ye know not what ye a&s;k. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I &s;hall drink of, and to be baptized with the bapti&s;m that I am baptized with?' Matt. xx.22. The two di&s;ci|ples, ravi&s;hed with the pro&s;pect of the dignity they were a&s;piring after, replied with|out he&s;itation, that they were both able and willing to &s;hare any hard&s;hip their Ma&s;ter might meet with in the way to his kingdom. To which he an&s;wered, that they &s;hould certainly &s;hare with him his troubles and afflictions; but that they had a&s;ked a favour which was not his to give: 'Ye &s;hall drink, indeed, of my cup, and be baptized with the bapti&s;m that I am baptized with: but to &s;it on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it &s;hall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.'</P>
<P>THE indignation of the re&s;t of the di&s;ciples being rai&s;ed by this ambitious reque&s;t of the two brothers, they thinking them&s;elves equally de&s;erving the principal po&s;ts in the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, were highly offended at the arrogance of the &s;ons of Zebedee. JESUS, therefore, in order to re&s;tore harmony among&s;t his di&s;ciples, told them, that his kingdom was very different from tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent world; and that the greatne&s;s of his di&s;ciples did not, like that of &s;ecular princes, con&s;i&s;t in reigning over others in an ab&s;olute and de&s;potic manner: 'Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exerci&s;e domi|nion over them, and they that are great, exerci&s;e authority upon them.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>JESUS,</HI> being arrived at Jericho, giveth &s;ight to two blind men near that Place: He vi&s;iteth Zaccheus the Publican, and delivers the Parable of a Nobleman who left Money with his Servants to trade with in his Ab&s;ence: The Rulers give Orders to apprehend him: Being arrived at Bethany, Mary anointeth his Feet: Judas murmureth at the Co&s;t. <HI>CHRIST</HI> rideth into Jeru&s;alem upon an A&s;s, amid&s;t the Acclamations of the multitude, and weepeth over the City.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR Lord with his di&s;ciples, and the multitude that accompanied him, being now arrived at Jericho, in their way to Jeru&s;alem, a famous city of Pale&s;tine, and the &s;econd in the kingdom. Near this town JESUS cured two blind men, who &s;at by the road begging, and expre&s;&s;ed their belief in him, as the Me&s;&s;iah: 'And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. And, behold, two blind men &s;itting by the way &s;ide, when they heard that JESUS pa&s;&s;ed by, cried out, &s;aying, have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David. And the multitude rebuked them, becau&s;e they &s;hould hold their peace: but they cried the more, &s;aying, Have mercy on us, O Lord thou Son of David,' Matt. xx.29, 30, 31.</P>
<P>THE Son of God &s;tood &s;till at this importunate reque&s;t of the two men, and called them to him, that, by their manner of walking, &s;pectators might be convinced that they were really blind. As &s;oon as they approached him, he a&s;ked them, what they re|que&s;ted with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s? To which the beggars an&s;wered, that they might receive their &s;ight: <HI>What will ye, that I &s;hall do unto you? They &s;ay, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</HI> This reque&s;t was not made in vain: their compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour touched their eyes, and immediately they received &s;ight, and followed him, glorifying and prai&s;ing God. After conferring &s;ight on the&s;e beggars, Zaccheus, chief of the publicans, having often heard the &s;ame of our Lord's miracles, was de&s;irous of &s;eeing his per&s;on; but the lowne&s;s of his &s;tature prevented him from &s;atisfying his curio&s;ity, <HI>he ran before, and climbed up a &s;ycamore tree to &s;ee him; for he was to pa&s;s that way.</HI> As JESUS approached the place where he was, <HI>he looked up, and &s;aw him, and &s;aid unto him, Zaccheus, make ha&s;te and come down; for to-day I mu&s;t abide at thy hou&s;e.</HI> Luke xix.5.</P>
<P>AT which conde&s;cen&s;ion of our Lord, the publican expre&s;&s;ed his joy, carried him to his hou&s;e, and &s;hewed him all the marks of civility in his power. But the people when they &s;aw he was going to the hou&s;e of a publican, condemned his conduct, as not con|formable to the character of a prophet. Zaccheus &s;eems to have heard the&s;e unju&s;t reflections; and, therefore, was willing to ju&s;tify him&s;elf before JESUS and his atten|dants: 'And Zaccheus &s;tood, and &s;aid unto the Lord, Behold Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man, by fal&s;e accu&s;ation, I re&s;tore him four fold. And Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, This day is &s;alvation come to thy hou&s;e, fora&s;much as he al&s;o is a &s;on of Abraham.'</P>
<P>FURTHER to convince the people that he acted agreeable to his character, in keeping company with publicans and &s;inners, our Lord told them, that the true intention of his coming was to recover tho&s;e who had wandered from the paths of virtue, and re&s;tore them to the rightful owner: <HI>The Son of man is come to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which is lo&s;t.</HI> While JESUS continued in the hou&s;e of Zaccheus the publican, he &s;pake a parable to his followers, who &s;uppo&s;ed, at his arrival in the royal city, he would erect the long-expected

kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah: 'A certain nobleman,' &s;aid he, 'went into a far country to re|ceive for him&s;elf a kingdom, and to return. And he called his ten &s;ervants, and deliver|ed to them ten pounds, and &s;aid unto them, Occupy till I come. But his citizens hated him, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age after him, &s;aying, We will not have this man to reign over us. And it came to pa&s;s, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded the&s;e &s;ervants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. Then came the fir&s;t, &s;aying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. And he &s;aid unto him, Well, thou good &s;ervant; becau&s;e thou ha&s;t been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. And the &s;econd came, &s;aying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. And he &s;aid likewi&s;e to him, be thou al&s;o over five cities. And another came &s;aying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: for I feared thee, becau&s;e thou art an au&s;tere man: thou take&s;t up that thou laye&s;t not down, and reape&s;t that thou did&s;t not &s;ow. And he &s;aith unto him, out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked &s;ervant. Thou knewe&s;t that I was an au&s;tere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not &s;ow: wherefore then gave&s;t not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with u&s;ury? And he &s;aid unto them that &s;tood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds. (And they &s;aid unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) For I &s;ay unto you, That unto every one which hath &s;hall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath &s;hall be taken away from him. But tho&s;e mine enemies, which would not that I &s;hould reign over them, bring hither, and &s;lay them before me.'</P>
<P>WE have the characters of three &s;orts of men in this parable delineated by our ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf; namely, the true di&s;ciples of the Me&s;&s;iah, the hypocrites, and the openly prophane: and the treatment the&s;e &s;ervants met with, repre&s;ents the final &s;enten|ces that will be pa&s;&s;ed upon them by the awful Judge of the whole earth. The true di&s;|ciples &s;hall be rewarded with the honours and plea&s;ures of immortality, the hypocrites &s;tripped of all the advantages they &s;o often boa&s;ted, and loaded with eternal infamy, and the open enemies of CHRIST, in proportion to the degree of their guilt, &s;hall &s;uffer &s;evere puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH this be the general &s;en&s;e of the parable, yet it has al&s;o a particular relation to the time when it was &s;poken; and was intended to teach the di&s;ciples, that though they might imagine that the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom was &s;peedily to be erected, and they were &s;oon to partake of its happine&s;s, yet this was not to happen before the death of their Ma&s;ter; that they them&s;elves mu&s;t perform a long and laborious cour&s;e of &s;ervices, before they received their eternal reward. That after his re&s;urrection, when he had obtained the kingdom, he would return from his &s;eat of maje&s;ty, and reckon with all his &s;ervants, and reward every one according to the improvements he had made in the tru&s;t commit|ted to his care; and that he would execute, in an exemplary manner, his vengeance on tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to let him reign over them, and did all in their power to hinder the erection of his kingdom among others. After &s;peaking this parable JESUS left the hou&s;e of Zaccheus the publican, and continued his journey towards Jeru&s;alem, where he propo&s;ed to celebrate the pa&s;&s;over; and was earne&s;tly expected by the people, who came up to purify them&s;elves, and who began to doubt whether he would venture to come to the fea&s;t. This delay, however, was occa&s;ioned by the proclamation i&s;&s;ued by the chief prie&s;ts, promi&s;ing a reward to any one who would di&s;cover the place of his retirement; <HI>Now both the chief prie&s;ts and the Phari&s;ees had given a commandment, that if any knew where he were, he &s;hould &s;hew it, that they might take him.</HI> John xi.57</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="029927_0184_0FE337F62DDC0550">JESUS arrived at Bethany, &s;ix days before the pa&s;&s;over, and repaired to the hou&s;e of Lazarus, whom he had rai&s;ed from the dead: 'there they made him a &s;upper; and Mar|tha &s;erved: but Lazarus was one of them that &s;at at the table with him. Then took Mary a pound of ointment of &s;pikenard, very co&s;tly, and anointed the feet of JESUS, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the hou&s;e was filled with the odour of the ointment. Then &s;aith one of his di&s;ciples, Judas I&s;cariot, Simon's &s;on, which &s;hould betray him, Why was not this ointment &s;old for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? This he &s;aid, not that he cared for the poor; but becau&s;e he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. Then &s;aid JESUS, Let her alone: again&s;t the day of my burying hath &s;he kept this. For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.'</P>
<P>BETHANY being not above two miles from Jeru&s;alem, the news of our Lord's arrival was &s;oon &s;pread through the capital, and great numbers of the citizens came to &s;ee Laza|rus, who had been rai&s;ed from the dead, together with the great prophet who had wrought &s;o &s;tupendous a miracle; and many of them were convinced both of the re&s;ur|rection of the former, and the divinity of the latter: but the news of their conver&s;ion, together with the rea&s;on of it, being currently reported in Jeru&s;alem, the chief prie&s;ts were &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of the weight &s;o great a miracle mu&s;t have on the minds of the people; and therefore determined to put both Lazarus and JESUS to death, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>OUR dear Lord was not ignorant of what the chief prie&s;ts and elders had determined again&s;t him, but was &s;o far from declining to vi&s;it Jeru&s;alem, that he even entered it in a public manner. When they 'were come to Bethpage, unto the mount of Olives, then &s;ent JESUS two di&s;ciples, &s;aying unto them, Go into the village over again&s;t you, and &s;traightway ye &s;hall find an a&s;s tied, and a colt with her: loo&s;e them, and bring them unto me. And if any man &s;ay ought unto you, ye &s;hall &s;ay, the Lord hath need of them; and &s;traightway he will &s;end them. All this was done, that it might be fulfilled, which was &s;poken by the prophet, &s;aying, tell the daughter of Sion, behold thy king cometh un|to thee, meek, and &s;itting upon an a&s;s, and a colt the foal of an a&s;s. And the di&s;cipels went, and did as JESUS commanded them, and brought the a&s;s, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they &s;et him thereon. And a very great multitude &s;pread their garments in the way, others cut down branches from the trees, and &s;trewed them in the way. And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried &s;aying, Ho&s;anna to the Son of David: Ble&s;&s;ed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Ho&s;anna in the highe&s;t. And when he was come into Jeru&s;alem, all the city was moved &s;aying, Who is this? And the multitude &s;aid, This is JESUS, the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.' Matt. xxi.1&mdash;11.</P>
<P>THIS circum&s;tance of our Lord has given more occa&s;ion for profane wit and ridicule, than any before: we reckon an a&s;s to be a contemptible creature, and a man, e&s;pecially a man of character, riding upon an a&s;s, a ridiculous figure. The&s;e are prejedices of our own times and country. And when they, who look no further than the manners and cu&s;toms before them, examine this part of the &s;acred &s;tory by the &s;tandard of modern prejudices, they &s;ee, or think they &s;ee, &s;omething quite incon&s;i&s;tent with the gravity and dignity of the per&s;on, pretending to be the king of the Jews, when Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented, entering in triumph into Jeru&s;alem, &s;itting on an a&s;s. But however con|temptible an a&s;s, or a man riding on that creature, may be at pre&s;ent, it was not &s;o from the beginning. In many countries, and particularly in Judea, per&s;ons of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction u&s;ually rode upon a&s;&s;es. The governors of I&s;rael are de&s;cribed in
<PB N="177" REF="029927_0185_0FE30EB102FFF1C0">
the &s;ong of Deborah, as riding on white a&s;&s;es, Judg. v.10. And the thirty &s;ons of Jair, who was judge and prince over I&s;rael twenty-two years, are &s;aid to ride on thirty a&s;&s;es, ch. x.4. And another judge is recorded to have had forty &s;ons, and thirty nephews, that rode on &s;eventy a&s;s colts,&mdash;ch. xii.14.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it may be a&s;ked, that &s;uppo&s;ing it was an u&s;ual thing to ride on an a&s;s, why &s;hould this common practice be mentioned in relation to the Me&s;&s;iah, as a mark of di&s;tinction? Might not the prophet, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, as well have &s;aid, he &s;hall come walking on foot? And would he not have been as well known by one character as by the other? Be&s;ides, if we turn to the book of Zachariah, where this prophecy is to be found, we &s;hall &s;ee the per&s;on, there de&s;cribed, to be a king, a ju&s;t king, and one having &s;alvation: and what is there in this character, of riding on the foal of an a&s;s, that is pecu|liar to a king, to a ju&s;t king, and to one who was to bring &s;alvation and deliverance to his people?</P>
<P>HOWEVER difficult the&s;e que&s;tions may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear, they are ea&s;ily an&s;wered; not by con&s;idering the &s;tate and condition of kings in general, but that peculiar to a king of I&s;rael, on which is founded the propriety of this character.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall generally find, if we look into the hi&s;tory of the ri&s;e and fall of nations, that their pro&s;perity and &s;ucce&s;s were proportionable to their force and power, and to the conduct and ability of their leaders. But with the Jews, who from &s;laves in Egypt be|came a powerful people, the ca&s;e was very different. The be&s;t and greate&s;t of their kings, and he who carried their empire to its greate&s;t height, has left us another account of their affairs: <HI>The people,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>got not the land in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by their own &s;word, neither did their own arm &s;ave them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy counte|nance, becau&s;e thou had&s;t a favour unto them,</HI> P&s;alm xliv.3.</P>
<P>WE are apt to a&s;cribe the&s;e and other &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages, to the piety and devotion of the P&s;almi&s;t; to con&s;ider them only as acknowledgments of God's general providence in the affairs of the world; and hence are apt to overlook, or not &s;ufficiently con&s;ider, the hi&s;to|rical truths they contain. It is true, indeed, that all &s;ucce&s;s, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, may be a&s;cribed to God; that it is he who giveth victory unto kings; but he generally maketh u&s;e of natural means, and it is no offence to his providence that kings li&s;t their thou&s;ands of hor&s;e and foot to &s;ecure them&s;elves and their dominions. But with the Jews it was very different: they were never &s;o weak as when they made them&s;elves &s;trong; never &s;o certainly ruined as when their force was great enough to create a confidence in them|&s;elves. For God had taken the defence of I&s;rael upon him&s;elf: and, the people were &s;ure to be undone whenever they took it out of his hands, to place it in their own.</P>
<P>GOD was &s;o tender of his honour in this re&s;pect, and &s;o concerned to ju&s;tify his pro|mi&s;e to protect I&s;rael in the eyes of the world, that he would not always permit natural cau&s;es to interfere in their deliverance, le&s;t the people &s;hould grow doubtful to whom they ought to a&s;cribe their victories. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on it was, that he commanded the people to have neither hor&s;es nor chariots of war for their defence: not becau&s;e they were thought u&s;ele&s;s in war; for it is well known that they were the &s;trength of the an|cient kingdoms; but becau&s;e God him&s;elf had undertaken their defence, and he wanted neither hor&s;e nor foot to fight their battles.</P>
<P>IT is evident from the Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory, that this law was ob&s;erved for near four hun|dred years; namely, till about the middle of Solomon's reign. And when David &s;way|ed the &s;ceptre of I&s;rael, when the kingdom was carried to its utmo&s;t height, he him&s;elf
<PB N="178" REF="029927_0186_0FE337F95D4DE460">
rode on a mule, and provided no better equipage for his &s;on, on the day of his corona|tion: <HI>Cau&s;e Solomon my &s;on,</HI> &s;aid David, <HI>to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon; and let Zadock the prie&s;t and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over I&s;rael,</HI> 1 Kings i.33, 34. And when that pious prince looked back, and contemplated this &s;tate of things, he might well &s;ay, <HI>Some tru&s;t in chariots and &s;ome in hor&s;es; but we will remember the name of the Lord our God,</HI> P&s;alm xx.7.</P>
<P>BUT things quickly changed their a&s;pect in the reign of Solomon: he married the daughter of the king of Egypt, and opened a commerce between that country and his own; by which means he &s;oon acquired an immen&s;e number of hor&s;es and cha|riots; and all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors when they had it in their power, followed his example. But what did the kingdom gain by his change? They were before a rich and flouri&s;h|ing people, but after breaking this law of the Mo&s;t High, their wealth and power gra|dually declined, till at la&s;t, their habitations were laid wa&s;te, their temple and cities burnt with fire, and they them&s;elves carried captive into a &s;trange land.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it may be a&s;ked, wherein the guilt of having a country full of hor&s;es con&s;i&s;ted? There is certainly no moral crime in purcha&s;ing or keeping the&s;e creatures; but the kings of I&s;rael were exalted to the throne, on condition that they &s;hould re|nounce the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of chariots and hor&s;es, and depend upon God for &s;ucce&s;s in the day of battle.</P>
<P>THUS having con&s;idered this law and the con&s;equences that re&s;ulted from the breach of it, let us now look back to the prophecy relating to the Me&s;&s;iah: <HI>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion; &s;hout O daughter of Jeru&s;alem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is ju&s;t, and having &s;alvation; lowly, and riding upon an a&s;s, and upon a colt the foal of an a&s;s. And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the hor&s;e from Jeru&s;alem,</HI> Zach. ix.9.10.</P>
<P>THE de&s;cendants of Jacob were to be &s;aved by &s;uch a king: and what &s;ort of a king could be expected? Is it po&s;&s;ible to imagine that God would &s;end a king to &s;ave them who &s;hould be like the kings which had undone them? Is it not more rea&s;onable to think, that he would re&s;emble tho&s;e who had been deliverers of their country? Kings who feared God, and therefore feared no enemy; who, though mounted on a&s;&s;es, and colts the foals of a&s;&s;es, were able to put to flight the thou&s;ands and ten thou|&s;ands of chariots and hor&s;es that came again&s;t them.</P>
<P>THE king, foretold by the prophet, was al&s;o to be ju&s;t, meek, and lowly; but how could he have de&s;erved that character, had he appeared in the pride and pomp of war, &s;urrounded with hor&s;es and chariots, in direct oppo&s;ition to the law of God? Or, as he was to bring &s;alvation to the people, could he make u&s;e of tho&s;e means which God never had pro&s;pered, and which he declared he never would?</P>
<P>BY this it appears, that it was e&s;&s;ential to the character of a king of I&s;rael, who was to be ju&s;t and lowly, and to bring &s;alvation with him, that he &s;hould come riding on an a&s;s, and a colt the foal of an a&s;s; but if any doubt can yet remain, let the prophet him&s;elf explain it, and immediately after the de&s;cription of the promi&s;ed kings, adds, <HI>and I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the hor&s;e from Jeru&s;alem:</HI> plainly intimating, that the character given of the Me&s;&s;iah, that he &s;hould ride on an a&s;s, was in oppo&s;ition to the pride of their warlike kings, who had ruined them&s;elves and their people, by their great &s;trength in chariots and hor&s;es.</P>
<P>WE have thus undeniably &s;hewn the intention of the prophet, when he foretold that the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould ride on an a&s;s; and from hence it appears, that the enemies of

revelation have not the lea&s;t rea&s;on for turning this tran&s;action into ridicule. Was it any reproach to CHRIST to ride into Jeru&s;alem on the foal of an a&s;s, when David, the greate&s;t of his ance&s;tors, and Solomon the wi&s;e&s;t, as long as he was wi&s;e, rode in the &s;ame manner? Can the Jews object to this circum&s;tance, and yet talk of the glories of David, and the magnificence of Solomon, who in the mid&s;t of all that glory and magni|ficence did the very &s;ame thing? Or can they &s;tumble at this character of the Me&s;&s;iah, without forgetting by what princes their ance&s;tors were &s;aved, and by what undone?</P>
<P>BUT to return. The prodigious multitude that now accompanied JESUS, filled the Phari&s;ees and great men with malice and envy, becau&s;e every method they had taken to hinder the people from following JESUS, had proved ineffectual: <HI>The Phari&s;ees therefore &s;aid among them&s;elves, perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? Behold the world is gone after him.</HI> John xii.19.</P>
<P>AS our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer drew near the city of Jeru&s;alem, &s;urrounded by the rejoicing multitude, notwith&s;tanding the many affronts he had there received, he beheld the city; and with a divine genero&s;ity and benevolence, which nothing can equal, wept over it; and, in the mo&s;t pathetic manner, lamented the calamities which he fore&s;aw were coming upon it, becau&s;e its inhabitants were ignorant of the time of their vi&s;itation: 'If,' &s;aid he, 'thou had&s;t known, even that thou, at lea&s;t, in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes, for the days &s;hall come upon thee, that thine enemies &s;hall ca&s;t a trench about thee, and compa&s;s thee round, and keep thee in on every &s;ide, and &s;hall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they &s;hall not leave in thee one &s;tone upon another; becau&s;e thou knowe&s;t not the time of thy vi&s;itation.' Luke xix.42, 43, 44.</P>
<P>YE wandering mortals, behold here an example and genero&s;ity infinitely &s;uperior to any furni&s;hed by the heathen world; an example highly worthy for them to imitate and admire!</P>
<P>WHEN our Lord entered Jeru&s;alem, &s;urrounded by the multitude, the whole city was moved on account of the prodigious concour&s;e of people that accompanied him, and by their continual acclamations, JESUS rode immediately to the temple; but it being even|ing, he &s;oon left the city, to the great di&s;couragement of the people, who expected he was immediately to have taken into his hands the reins of government: <HI>And Je&s;us entered into Jeru&s;alem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the even tide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.</HI> Mark xi.11.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>EARLY the next morning our dear Lord left Bethany, to vi&s;it again the capital of Judea: and, as he pur&s;ued his journey, he &s;aw at a di&s;tance a fig-tree, which from its fulne&s;s of leaves promi&s;ed abundance of fruit. This inviting object induced him to approach it, in expectation of finding figs; for he was hungry, and the &s;ea&s;on for gathering them was not yet arrived: but, on his coming to the tree, he found it to be really barren; upon which our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;aid to it, <HI>Let no fruit grow on thee for ever,</HI> Matt. xxi.19.</P>
<P>THIS tran&s;action of our Lord, which was purely emblematical, and prefigured the &s;peedy ruin of the Jewi&s;h nation, on account of its unfruitfulne&s;s, under all the advan|tages it then enjoyed, has, by the enemies of revelation, been repre&s;ented as an action unbecoming the Redeemer of mankind: but, if they had fully con&s;idered its inten|tion, that they would have been convinced, that, like the re&s;t of his miracles, it was done with a gracious intention; namely, to awaken his countrymen from their lethargy, and prevent the total ruin of their church and nation, by repentance.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, being di&s;appointed in finding fruit on this fig-tree, pur&s;ued his journey to Jeru&s;alem; and, on his arrival, went &s;traightway to the temple, the outer court of which he found full of merchandi&s;e. A &s;ight like this, vexed his meek and righteous &s;oul: &s;o that having made a &s;mall &s;courge of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the &s;eats of them that &s;old doves, and would not &s;uffer any ve&s;&s;el to be carried through the temple: &s;aying unto them, <HI>Is it not written, my hou&s;e &s;hall be called of all nations, a hou&s;e of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is con&s;idered by St. Jerom as one of the greate&s;t of all our Saviour's miracles, and it mu&s;t be owned that the circum&s;tances are very extraordinary, that one man &s;hould undertake &s;o bold, and execute &s;o hazardous a ta&s;k; one man, without a com|mi&s;&s;ion from Cae&s;ar, without any countenance from the Jewi&s;h rulers, without any arms, either to terrify the multitude, or defend him&s;elf; that he &s;hould ca&s;t out the whole tribe of mercenary trafficers, wre&s;t from tho&s;e wor&s;hipers of wealth their darling idol, and trample under foot their great Diana; and all this without tumult or oppo&s;ition: not one of the &s;acrilegious rabble daring to move the hand or open the mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="029927_0189_0FE33806C3094090">ACCORDING to tradition, a certain bright and dazzling lu&s;tre fla&s;hed from his eyes, which the people were unable to bear, as they formerly could not behold the face of Mo&s;es, for the glory that &s;urrounded him: but as the &s;criptures take no notice of this tran&s;cendent lu&s;tre, we mu&s;t only adore the greatne&s;s of the fact, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;o improve this miracle to our &s;piritual advantage, as to &s;ecure by accepting his grace, the power of this mighty Reformer on our &s;ide, that when he &s;hall come in glory, we may be &s;afe under the &s;hadow of his almighty wings, while he takes fearful vengeance on tho&s;e who have defiled his holy temple, and made it a den of thieves; and tho&s;e who have robbed Omnipotence of his due, will then find their &s;ouls deprived of their everla&s;ting rewards in the happy man&s;ions of a ble&s;&s;ed eternity.</P>
<P>THE temple being thus cleared by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, of this avaricious tribe of dealers, the people brought unto htm the blind, the lame, and the di&s;ea&s;ed, who were all healed by the Son of God; &s;o that the very children proclaimed him to be the great Son of David, the long expected Me&s;&s;iah, when they &s;aw the many miraculous cures he per|formed.</P>
<P>THE Phari&s;ees were highly provoked at the&s;e tran&s;actions, but they feared the people, and therefore only a&s;ked him, if he heard what the children &s;aid? in&s;inuating that he ought to rebuke them, and not &s;uffer them thus to load him with the highe&s;t prai&s;es. But JESUS, in&s;tead of giving a direct an&s;wer to their que&s;tion, repeated a pa&s;&s;age out of the eighth P&s;alm: <HI>Have ye never read,</HI> &s;aid the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, <HI>out of the mouths of babes and &s;ucklings, thou ha&s;t perfected prai&s;e?</HI> Giving them to under&s;tand, that the meane&s;t of God's works are &s;o formed, as to declare the greatne&s;s of his protection; and that if the Father does not refu&s;e the prai&s;e which ari&s;es from the lea&s;t of his creatures, &s;o the Son did not di&s;dain that offered him by children. In the pre&s;ent juncture, prai&s;e was pecu|liarly acceptable, as it implied, that his miracles were &s;o exceedingly illu&s;trious, that they led the tender minds of children, illuminated only with the dawnings of rea&s;on, to acknowledge him for the Me&s;&s;iah &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired, and &s;o long expected, by all the de&s;cendants of Jacob.</P>
<P>IN the evening, our Lord with his di&s;ciples, left the city and retired to Bethany, where his benevolent miracle, in rai&s;ing Lazarus from the dead had procured him many friends, among whom he was always in &s;afety. The next morning, as they were re|turning to Jeru&s;alem, the di&s;ciples were a&s;toni&s;hed at beholding the fig-tree that had been but the morning before declared barren, <HI>dried up from the roots:</HI> they had, in all probability, forgotten what our Saviour had &s;aid to this fig-tree, till its dry and withered a&s;pect brought it again to their memory. Peter, on &s;eeing this a&s;toni&s;hing phenome|non, &s;aid unto JESUS, <HI>Ma&s;ter, behold the fig-tree which thou cur&s;ed&s;t is withered away!</HI> To which JESUS an&s;wered, that whoever had faith in the Almighty, or thoroughly be|lieved in his miracles, &s;hould be able to do much greater things than the withering of the fig-tree: 'And JESUS an&s;wering, &s;aith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I &s;ay unto you, that who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou ca&s;t into the &s;ea; and &s;hall not doubt in his heart, but &s;hall believe, that tho&s;e things which he &s;eeth &s;hall come to pa&s;s; he &s;hall have what&s;oever he &s;aith,' Mark xi.22, 23.</P>
<P>HE al&s;o added, that what&s;oever they &s;hould a&s;k by faith, they &s;hould receive; and concluded, by giving them directions concerning prayer, which was nece&s;&s;ary to in|crea&s;e the faith he mentioned: 'And when ye &s;tand praying, forgive, if ye have ought

again&s;t any: that your Father al&s;o which is in heaven, may forgive you your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven, forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.'</P>
<P>DURING our dear Redeemer's continuance in the temple, certain pro&s;elyted Greeks, who came up to wor&s;hip at Jeru&s;alem, de&s;ired to &s;ee him, having long cheri&s;hed ex|pectations of beholding the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah. Accordingly, they applied to Philip, a native of Beth&s;aida, who mentioned it to Andrew, and he told it to JESUS. Upon which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour told his di&s;ciples, that he &s;hould &s;oon be honoured with the conver&s;ion of the Gentiles: <HI>The hour is come,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that the Son of man &s;hould be glori|fied.</HI> But declared, that before this glorious event happened, he mu&s;t &s;uffer death; illu&s;trating the nece&s;&s;ity there was of his dying, by the &s;imilitude of ca&s;ting grain into the earth: <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground, and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit,</HI> John xii.24. Adding, that &s;ince it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him, their Lord and Ma&s;ter, to &s;uffer the pains of death before he a&s;cended the throne of his glory; &s;o they, as his followers, mu&s;t al&s;o expect, to be per&s;ecuted and &s;pitefully u&s;ed for his name &s;ake; but if they per&s;evered, and even re&s;olved to lo&s;e their lives in his &s;ervice, he would reward their con&s;tancy with a crown of glory. And at the &s;ame time he tacitly in&s;inuated, that the &s;trangers, if their de&s;ire of conver&s;ing with him proceeded from an expectation of obtaining temporal preferments, would find them&s;elves greatly di&s;appointed: 'If any man &s;erve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there &s;hall al&s;o my &s;ervant be: if any man &s;erve me, him will my Father honour.'</P>
<P>THUS having &s;urveyed his own &s;ufferings, and propo&s;ed them as an example to his di&s;ciples, the melancholy pro&s;pect &s;o greatly moved him, that he uttered in a very pathetic manner his grief, and addre&s;&s;ed his heavenly Father for &s;uccour in his di&s;tre&s;s: <HI>Now is my &s;oul troubled; and what &s;hall I &s;ay? Father, &s;ave me from this hour: but for this cau&s;e came I unto this hour.</HI></P>
<P>WE &s;hould learn by this example of our Lord, that prayer is the only method of ea&s;ing the mind overwhelmed with di&s;tre&s;s; but at the &s;ame time, to be always re&s;igned to the divine will: for though the weakne&s;s of human nature may &s;hrink when per|&s;ecutions or &s;ufferings of any kind appear in all their hideous forms; yet, by reflect|ing on the wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, and power of God to deliver us, we ought to &s;upport every trial, however &s;evere, with patience, as he doubtle&s;s propo&s;es &s;ome happy end by the&s;e afflictions.</P>
<P>OUR dear Redeemer, having given vent to his melancholy reflections, and made a &s;hort prayer to his heavenly Father, begged of God to demon&s;trate the truth of his mi&s;&s;ion, by &s;ome token which could not be re&s;i&s;ted: <HI>Father, glorify thy name.</HI> Nor had the great Saviour of mankind hardly uttered the&s;e words, before he was an&s;wered by an audible voice from heaven, <HI>I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</HI> The mi|racles thou ha&s;t already performed have glorified my name; and, by other miracles, to be wrought before the &s;ons of men, I will &s;till continue to glorify it.</P>
<P>THIS voice was evidently preternatural, re&s;embling thunder in loudne&s;s, but &s;uffi|ciently articulate to be under&s;tood by tho&s;e who heard our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour pray to his heavenly Father. And JESUS told his di&s;ciples, that it was not given for his &s;ake but to confirm them in their faith of his mi&s;&s;ion: <HI>This voice,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>came not becau&s;e of me, but for your &s;akes.</HI> It came to confirm what I have told you relating to my &s;ufferings, death, re&s;urrection, and the conver&s;ion of the whole Gentile world to the Chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="029927_0191_0FE3381264950550">A pro&s;pect like this, could not fail of being agreeable to that compa&s;&s;ionate Being, who came down from heaven to redeem lo&s;t and undone mankind, and of removing the melancholy thoughts that afflicted his &s;potle&s;s &s;oul: and, acccordingly, he communicated this comfortable reflection to his di&s;ciples, telling them that the time was at hand when the kingdom of Satan &s;hould be de&s;troyed, and the &s;ons of men exalted with him&s;elf into the happy regions of the heavenly Canaan: <HI>Now is the judgment of this world: now &s;hall the prince of this world be ca&s;t out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the people on hearing our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer affirm, that he was to &s;uffer death on the cro&s;s, or as he termed it, <HI>be lifted up from the earth,</HI> could not reconcile what he &s;aid with the prophecies made concerning the Me&s;&s;iah, whom they &s;uppo&s;ed was never to ta&s;te of death: <HI>We have heard,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>out of the law, that Chri&s;t abideth forever: and how &s;aye&s;t thou, The Son of man mu&s;t be lifted up?</HI> To which our ble&s;&s;ed Lord replied, that they &s;hould &s;oon be deprived of his pre&s;ence and miracles, and therefore they would do well to li&s;ten attentively to his precepts, firmly believe the doctrines he de|livered, and wi&s;ely improve them to their eternal advantage; for otherwi&s;e, they would be &s;oon overtaken with &s;piritual blindne&s;s, and rendered incapable of inheriting the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel: that while they enjoyed the benefit of his preaching and miracles, which &s;ufficiently proved the truth of his mi&s;&s;ion from the Mo&s;t High, they &s;hould believe on him, for by that means alone they could become the children of God: 'Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, le&s;t dark|ne&s;s come upon you: for he that walketh in darkne&s;s, knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;poken the&s;e words to the people, our dear Lord retired privately from Jeru&s;alem, probably to Bethany: but, notwith&s;tanding the many miracles our great Redeemer had wrought in the pre&s;ence of this perver&s;e and &s;tiff-necked people, the generality of them refu&s;ed to own him for the Me&s;&s;iah; being filled with the vain expectations of a temporal prince, who was to rule over all the kingdoms of the earth, and place his throne in Jeru&s;alem. Some, indeed, even of the rulers, believed on him, though, valuing the good opinion of men above the approbation of the Almighty, they thought it prudent to conceal their faith, le&s;t they &s;hould, like the blind man, be ex|communicated, or put out of the &s;ynagogue.</P>
<P>BUT our Redeemer being willing to cheri&s;h the lea&s;t glimmerings of faith, wherever it appeared, he &s;oon returned to Jeru&s;alem; and to in&s;pire &s;uch as believed on him with courage, he cried in the temple, <HI>He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that &s;ent me.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, the doctrine I preach to the children of men, is &s;o evi|dently from God, that he who believeth on me, believeth more properly on the Almigh|ty, who &s;ent me into the world, and by who&s;e authority alone I preach the go&s;pel: adding, he that &s;eeth the miracles I perform, &s;eeth the operations of that omnipotent power by which I act; I am the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, who&s;e beams di&s;pel the dark|ne&s;s of ignorance in which the &s;ons of men are involved, and am come to deliver all who believe on me, out of that palpable darkne&s;s. You mu&s;t not however expect, that I will at pre&s;ent execute my judgments upon tho&s;e who refu&s;e to embrace the doctrines of the go&s;pel; for I am not come to condemn and puni&s;h, but to &s;ave the world, and con&s;equently to try every gentle and winning method to reclaim the wicked from the error of their ways, and turn their feet into the paths of virtue, which lead to the happy man&s;ions of my Father's kingdom: they &s;hall not, however e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed who neglect the in&s;tructions and offers of &s;alvation now made to them; for the doctrine I
<PB N="184" REF="029927_0192_0FE30EB5AF88E260">
have preached, &s;hall bear witne&s;s again&s;t them at the awful tribunal of the la&s;t day; and as it has aggravated their &s;in, &s;o it &s;hall then heighten their puni&s;hment. I well know, that the doctrines and precepts which the Father hath commanded me to preach, are the only conditions of eternal life; and, therefore, I have promi&s;ed them with the greate&s;t faithfulne&s;s, per&s;picuity, and confidence; con&s;equently I am worthy of credit, both with regard to my mi&s;&s;ion, and the faithfulne&s;s with which I have executed the commands of the Mo&s;t High.</P>
<P>A deputation of prie&s;ts and elders was &s;ent from the &s;upreme council, while our Lord was thus preaching in the temple, to a&s;k him concerning the nature of the authority by which he acted, whether it was as prophet, prie&s;t, or king, as no other per&s;on had a right to make any alterations either in church or &s;tate; and, if he laid claim to either of tho&s;e characters, from whom he received it; But our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, in&s;tead of giving a direct an&s;wer to the que&s;tion of the Phari&s;ees, a&s;ked them another; promi&s;ing, if they re&s;olved his que&s;tion, he would al&s;o an&s;wer theirs: <HI>I al&s;o will a&s;k you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like manner will tell you by what authority I do the&s;e things. The bapti&s;m of John, whence was it? from heaven or of men?</HI> Matt. xxi.14, 25.</P>
<P>THE prie&s;ts were reduced, by this que&s;tion, to an inextricable dilemma: they con&s;i|dered, on the one hand, that if they &s;aid it was from God, it would oblige them to ac|knowledge the authority of JESUS, John having more than once publicly declared him to be the Me&s;&s;iah; and, on the other, if they peremptorily denied the authority of John, they would be in danger of being &s;toned by the people, who, in general, con&s;idered him as a prophet: they therefore thought it the mo&s;t eligible method to an&s;wer, that they could not tell from whence John's bapti&s;m was. Thus, by declining to an&s;wer the que&s;tion a&s;ked them by JESUS, they left him at liberty to decline giving the council the &s;atisfaction they had &s;ent to demand: and, at the &s;ame time, they plainly confe&s;&s;ed, that they were unable to pa&s;s any &s;entence on John the Bapti&s;t, notwith&s;tanding he claimed the character of a me&s;&s;enger from God, and they had &s;ent to examine his preten&s;ions. This was, in effect, to acknowledge, that they were incapable of judging of any prophet what&s;oever; well, therefore, might the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS &s;ay, <HI>Neither tell I you by what authori|ty I do the&s;e things.</HI> You have no right to a&s;k, &s;ince you have confe&s;&s;ed you are unable to judge; and, for that rea&s;on, I &s;hall not &s;atisfy your inquiry.</P>
<P>THIS deputation of the elders having &s;aid, that they were ignorant from whence the bapti&s;m of John was, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;harply rebuked them, conveying his reproof in the parable of the two &s;ons commanded to work in their father's vineyard; and made them condemn them&s;elves, by a&s;king their opinion of the two. <HI>A certain man,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>had two &s;ons; and he came to the fir&s;t, and &s;aid, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</HI> But this ungracious youth very roughly an&s;wered the kind command of his father, and, with|out the lea&s;t preface, or appellation of re&s;pect, an&s;wered, <HI>I will not</HI>: but, after reflecting on the impropriety and indecency of &s;uch behaviour to this kind and indulgent father, he repented of what he had done, and went to work in the vineyard. The father having met with &s;o har&s;h a reply from the former &s;on, had recour&s;e to the other, and in the &s;ame man|ner ordered him to work that day in his vineyard. This &s;on was very different from the former, and in a very dutiful manner &s;aid, <HI>I go Sir.</HI> But notwith&s;tanding this &s;eeming obedience, he delayed to do as his father de&s;ired; he did not go to work in the vineyard. The temper and behaviour of this &s;econd &s;on were exactly conformable to that of the Phari&s;ees: they gave the Almighty the mo&s;t honourable titles, and profe&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t zeal for his &s;ervice, in their prayers and prai&s;es; but at the &s;ame time refu&s;ed to do any part of the work that he enjoined them. In the character of the other &s;on, the di&s;po&s;i|tion

of the publicans and harlots is well de&s;cribed. They neither profe&s;&s;ed or promi&s;ed to do the will of their Creator; but when they came to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly, on their con|duct, and the offers of mercy which were &s;o kindly made them, they &s;ubmitted to our Sa|viour, and amended their lives in con&s;equence of their faith.</P>
<P>OUR Lord having thus fini&s;hed the parable, a&s;ked the Phari&s;ees, <HI>Whether of them twain did the will of his Father? They &s;ay unto him, the fir&s;t.</HI> They did not immediately perceive, that by this an&s;wer they condemned them&s;elves, till our Saviour made a ju&s;t application to the parable, in this &s;harp, but ju&s;t rebuke: 'Verily I &s;ay unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came unto you in the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and ye believed him not,' nor entered into your father's vineyard, though like the &s;econd &s;on, you promi&s;e in the mo&s;t fair and candid manner; <HI>but the publicans and the harlots believed him,</HI> repented of their former di&s;obedience, and entered into the vineyard.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Lord did not re&s;t &s;atisfied with &s;hewing the Phari&s;ees the heniou&s;ne&s;s of their &s;in in rejecting the Bapti&s;t, but he thought proper al&s;o to repre&s;ent the crime of the nation in rejecting all the prophets which had been &s;ent &s;ince they became a nation, and among the re&s;t, the only begotten Son of the Mo&s;t High; warning them, at the &s;ame time, of their danger, and the puni&s;hment that would inevitably en&s;ue, if they continued in their rebellion. The outward economy of religion, in which they gloried, would be taken from them; their relation to God, as his people, cancelled; and the national con&s;titution de&s;troyed: but becau&s;e the&s;e topics were extremely di&s;agreeable, he delivered them under the veil of the following parable: <HI>There was,</HI> &s;aid he <HI>a certain hou&s;eholder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a wine pre&s;s in it, and built a tower, and let it out to hu&s;bandmen, and went into a far country.</HI></P>
<P>WE frequently find in the &s;acred &s;criptures, the compari&s;on of the church to a vine|yard; but this particular parable, for the fuller conviction of the Jews, is expre&s;sly taken from the fifth chapter of the prophet I&s;aiah, with which they could not fail of being well acquainted, nor ignorant of its meaning, as the prophet at the end of it adds: <HI>The vineyard of the Lord of ho&s;ts is the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and the men of Judah his plea&s;ant plant: and he looked for judgment, but beheld oppre&s;&s;ion; for righteou&s;ne&s;s, but behold a cry.</HI> Our Saviour, therefore, continued the metaphor, telling them; <HI>That when the time of the fruit drew near, he &s;ent his &s;ervants to the hu&s;bandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. And the hu&s;bandmen took his &s;ervants, and beat one, and killed another, and &s;toned another.</HI> The Almighty &s;ent the prophets to exhort the Jews to entertain ju&s;t &s;entiments of religion, and tread the paths of virtue; but the Jews, extremely irritated at the pro|phets for the freedom they u&s;ed in reproving their &s;ins, per&s;ecuted and &s;lew them with unrelenting fury. Their wickedne&s;s, however, in killing the&s;e me&s;&s;engers, did not in|&s;tantly provoke the Almighty to pour down his vengeance upon them; he &s;ent more prophets to exhort and reclaim them, but they met with no better fate than the former. His mercy however, &s;till continued; and that no means might be left untried, he &s;ent unto them his own &s;on, who&s;e authority, being clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed by undeniable mira|cles, ought to have been acknowledged cheerfully by the&s;e wicked men: but how different was the con&s;equences? 'When the hu&s;bandmen &s;aw the &s;on, they &s;aid among them&s;elves, this is the heir; come let us kill him, and let us &s;eize on his inheritance. When the Lord, therefore, of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto tho&s;e hu&s;band|men? they &s;ay unto him. He will mi&s;erably de&s;troy tho&s;e wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other hu&s;bandmen, which &s;hall render him the fruits in their &s;ea&s;on.'</P>

But, to confirm the truth of this, our Saviour added a remarkable prophecy of him&s;elf, and of his rejection, from the 118th P&s;alm: <HI>Did ye never,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>read in the Scriptures, The &s;tone which the builders rejected, the &s;ame is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</HI></P>
<P>THE rejection of the Me&s;&s;iah by the Jews, and the reception he met with among the Gentiles, all brought to pa&s;s by the providence of God, are wonderful events: and there|fore I &s;ay unto you, the kingdom of God &s;hall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</P>
<P>THE chief prie&s;ts, perceiving the drift of our Saviour's parable, were highly incen&s;ed, and would gladly have apprehended him; but they feared the people, who acknow|ledged him as the Me&s;&s;iah while they &s;urrounded him in the temple.</P>
<P>BUT as the rulers were afraid to apprehend JESUS, he was at liberty to proceed in the offices of his mini&s;try; accordingly he delivered another parable, wherein he de&s;cribed on the one hand, the bad &s;ucce&s;s which the preaching of the go&s;pel was to meet with among&s;t the Jews; and, on the other, the cheerful reception given it among the Gen|tiles. This gracious de&s;ign of the Almighty, in giving the go&s;pel to the children of men, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour illu&s;trated by the behaviour of a certain king, who, in honour of his &s;on, made a great fea&s;t, to which he invited many gue&s;ts: The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king; which made a marriage for his &s;on. This marriage-&s;upper, or great fea&s;t, &s;ignifies the joys of heaven, which are properly compared to an elegant entertainment, on account of their exqui&s;itene&s;s and duration; and are here &s;aid to be prepared in honour of the Son of God, being be&s;towed on men as a reward for their obedience.</P>
<P>BUT before the &s;upper was ready, the &s;ervants were &s;ent forth to call the gue&s;ts to the wedding; that is, when the fulne&s;s of time approached, the Jews, as being the peculiar people of God, were fir&s;t called to the great fea&s;t of heaven by John the Bapti&s;t, and afterwards by CHRIST him&s;elf; but they refu&s;ed all the&s;e benevolent calls of mercy, and rejected the kind invitations of the go&s;pel, though pre&s;&s;ed by the preaching of the Me&s;|&s;iah, and his forerunner. After our Saviour's re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion, the apo&s;tles were &s;ent forth to inform the Jews, that the go&s;pel-covenant was e&s;tabli&s;hed; that man|&s;ions in heaven was prepared; and that nothing was wanting but their cheerful acceptance of the honour de&s;igned them: <HI>Again, he &s;ent forth other &s;ervants, &s;aying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.</HI> But the&s;e me&s;&s;engers were as un&s;ucce&s;sful as the former. The Jews undervaluing the favour offered them, mocked at the me&s;&s;age; and &s;ome of them, more rude than the re&s;t, in&s;ulted, beat and &s;lew the &s;ervants, that had been &s;ent to call them to the marriage-&s;upper of the lamb: But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth; and &s;ent forth his armies, and de&s;troyed tho&s;e murderers, and burnt up their city.

<P>THE benevolent calls of the go&s;pel being thus rejected by the Jews, the king again &s;ent forth his &s;ervants into the countries of the Gentiles, with orders to compel all that they met with to come into the marriage.

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Our Saviour an&s;wers the in&s;idious Que&s;tion of the Phari&s;ees concerning paying tribute to Cae&s;ar: He confuteth the Sadducees who que&s;tioned him touching the Re&s;urrection: He &s;heweth which are the two great Commandments of the Law: He propo&s;eth to the Phari&s;ees a Que&s;tion con|cerning him&s;elf: He exhorteth to ob&s;erve the Doctrine, but not to follow the evil Example of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees; and particularly not to imitate their ambition: He pronounceth divers Woes again&s;t the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, for their Blindne&s;s and Hypocri&s;y: and pro|po&s;eth the De&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE parable of the marriage-&s;upper incen&s;ed the Phari&s;ees in &s;uch a manner, that they immediately concerted with the Herodians or Sadducees on the mo&s;t proper method of putting our Lord to death. It is &s;ufficiently evident, that their hatred was now carried to the highe&s;t pitch; becau&s;e the mo&s;t violent enmity which had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two &s;ects, was on this occa&s;ion &s;u&s;pended, and they joined toge|ther to execute this cruel determination on the Son of God: they, however, thought it mo&s;t eligible to act very cautiou&s;ly, and endeavour if po&s;&s;ible, to catch &s;ome ha&s;ty expre&s;&s;ion from him, that they might render him odious to the people, and procure &s;omething again&s;t him, that might &s;erve as a ba&s;is for a pro&s;ecution. Accordingly, they &s;ent &s;ome of their di&s;ciples to him, with orders to &s;eign them&s;elves ju&s;t men, who maintained the greate&s;t veneration for the divine law, and dreaded nothing more than the doing any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with its precepts; and, under this &s;pecious cloak of hypocri&s;y, to beg his determination of an affair that had long lain heavy on their con|&s;ciences; namely, the paying tribute to Cae&s;ar, which they thought incon&s;i&s;tent with their zeal for religion. This que&s;tion was, it &s;eems, furiou&s;ly debated in our Saviour's time; one Judas, a native of Galilee, having in&s;pired the people with a notion, that taxes to
<PB N="188" REF="029927_0197_0FE3382135A1A510">
a foreign power were ab&s;olutely unlawful. A doctrine &s;o plea&s;ing to the worldly-minded Jews, could not fail of friends, e&s;pecially among the lower cla&s;s; and there|fore, mu&s;t have many partizans among&s;t the multitude that then &s;urrounded the Son of God. The prie&s;ts, therefore imagined, that it was not in his power to decide the point, without rendering him&s;elf obnoxious to &s;ome of the parties: if he &s;hould &s;ay it was lawful to pay the taxes they believed, that the people in who&s;e hearing the que&s;|tion was propo&s;ed, would be incen&s;ed again&s;t him, not only as a ba&s;e pretender, who, on being attacked, publicly renounced the character of the Me&s;&s;iah, which he had a&s;&s;um|ed among his friends, but al&s;o as a flatterer of princes, and a betrayer of the liberties of his country; one who taught doctrines incon&s;i&s;tent with the known privileges of the people of God: but if he &s;hould affirm, that it was unlawful to pay tribute, they de|termined to inform the governor, who they hoped, would puni&s;h him as a fomenter of &s;edition. Highly elated with their project, they accordingly came; and, after pa&s;&s;ing an encomium on the truth of his mi&s;&s;ion, his courage, and his impartiality, they pro|po&s;ed this famous que&s;tion: 'Ma&s;ter,' &s;aid they, 'we know that thou art true and care&s;t for no man; for thou regarde&s;t not the per&s;on of men, but teache&s;t the way of God in truth. Tell us therefore, what thinke&s;t thou, is it lawful to give tribute unto Cae&s;ar or not?'</P>
<P>HOWEVER, though they had artfully laid the &s;cheme, they could not deceive our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, who beheld the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of their hearts: he &s;aw their &s;ecret inten|tions; and accordingly called them hypocrites, to &s;ignify, that though they made con|&s;cience, and a regard for the divine will, their pretence for propo&s;ing this que&s;tion, he &s;aw their de&s;ign, and knew that their intention was only to en&s;nare him.</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour did not decline an&s;wering their que&s;tion, but previou&s;ly de&s;ired to &s;ee a piece of the tribute money. The piece was accordingly pro|duced, and proved to be coined by the Romans. Upon which our dear Lord an&s;wer|ed them, &s;ince this money bears the image of Cae&s;ar, it is his; and by making u&s;e of it, you acknowledge his authority: if &s;o, I leave it to your&s;elves, to judge whether tribute ought not to be paid towards the &s;upport of that government, which ye have acknowledged, which ye cannot &s;hake off, and by which your tranquility is pre&s;erved: but, at the &s;ame time that, you di&s;charge your duty to the civil magi&s;trate, you &s;hould never forget the duty you owe to you God; but remember that as you bear the image of the great, the omnipotent King, you are his &s;ubjects, and ought to pay him the tribute of your&s;elves, &s;erving him to the very utmo&s;t of your power.</P>
<P>UNDER a pretence of religion, the Phari&s;ees and their followers often ju&s;tified &s;edi|tion; but the Herodians, in order to ingratiate them&s;elves with the reigning powers, made them a compliment of their con&s;ciences, complying with whatever they enjoined, however oppo&s;ite their commands might be to the divine law. Our Lord therefore adapted his an&s;wer to them both, exhorting them in their regards to God and the ma|gi&s;trate, to give each his due; as, when their rights only are in&s;i&s;ted on, there can be no incon&s;i&s;tency between them.</P>
<P>JESUS, by &s;o unexpected an an&s;wer, confuted them on their own principles, and &s;hewed, that the rights of God, and tho&s;e of the magi&s;trate, do not in the lea&s;t interfere; becau&s;e magi&s;trates are God's deputies, and rule by his authority: this quite di&s;concerted and &s;ilenced the&s;e crafty enemies; they were a&s;toni&s;hed both at his having di&s;covered their de&s;ign, and his wi&s;dom in avoiding the &s;nare they had &s;o artfully laid for him: <HI>When they heard the&s;e words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way,</HI> Matt. xxii.22.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="029927_0198_0FE33822BA81EBA8">BUT the mi&s;carriage of this &s;cheme did not intimidate others from renewing the attack; enemies came again&s;t him from every quarter. The Sadducees, who denied the doctrine of a future &s;tate, together with the exi&s;tence of angels and &s;pirits, fir&s;t re|turned to the charge; propo&s;ing to him their &s;tronge&s;t argument again&s;t the re&s;urrection which they deduced from the law given by Mo&s;es, with regard to marriage: <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>Mo&s;es wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without chil|dren, that his brother &s;hould take his wife, and rai&s;e up &s;eed unto his brother. There were therefore, &s;even brethren; and the fir&s;t took a wife, and died without children. And the &s;econd took her to wife, and he died childle&s;s. And the third took her; and in like manner the &s;even al&s;o: and they left no children and died. La&s;t of all the woman died al&s;o. Therefore, in the re&s;urrection, who&s;e wife of them is &s;he? for &s;even had her to wife.</HI> Luke xx.28&mdash;33.</P>
<P>BUT the Sadducees, believing the &s;oul to be nothing more than a refined matter, were per&s;uaded, that if there was any future &s;tate, it mu&s;t re&s;emble the pre&s;ent; and the being in that &s;tate material and mortal, the human race could not be continued, nor the indi|viduals rendered happy without the plea&s;ures and conveniencies of marriage: and hence con&s;idered that every man's wife &s;hould be re&s;tored to him, as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the doctrine of the re&s;urrection, or a future &s;tate.</P>
<P>BUT our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;oon confuted this argument, by telling the Phari&s;ees they were ignorant of the power of God, who had created &s;pirit as well as matter, and who can render man completely happy in the enjoyment of him&s;elf. He al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the nature of the life obtained in a future &s;tate, made marriage altogether &s;uperfluous, becau&s;e in the world to come, men being &s;piritual and immortal, like the angels, there was no need of natural means to propagate or continue the kind: <HI>Ye do err,</HI> &s;aid our dear Lord, <HI>not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the re&s;urrection, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage.</HI> Matt. xxii.29. <HI>Neither can they die any more; for they are equal unto the angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the re&s;ur|rection.</HI> Luke xx.36. Hence we may ob&s;erve, that good men are called the children of the Mo&s;t High, from their inheritance at the re&s;urrection, and particularly on account of their being adorned with immortality.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;hewn their ignorance of the true nature of a future &s;tate, and the dif|ference between corporeal and &s;piritual beings, our dear Lord proceeded to &s;hew that they were al&s;o ignorant of the &s;criptures, and particularly of the writings of Mo&s;es, from whence they had drawn their objection: for he demon&s;trated, from the very law it&s;elf, the certainty of a re&s;urrection, at lea&s;t, that of ju&s;t men, and con&s;equently quite demo|li&s;hed the opinion of the Sadducees, who by believing the materiality of the &s;oul, affirmed that men were annihilated at their death, and that their opinion was founded on the writings of Mo&s;es: <HI>Now,</HI> &s;aid our Saviour, <HI>that the dead are rai&s;ed, even Mo&s;es &s;hewed at the bu&s;h, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;aac, and the God of Jacob. For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</HI> Luke xx.37, 38. As if he had &s;aid, The Almighty cannot properly be called God, unle&s;s he has his people, and be Lord of the living. Since, therefore, Mo&s;es called him the God of Abraham, the God of I&s;aac, and the God of Jacob, long after the&s;e vene|rable patriarchs were dead, the relation denoted by the word <HI>God,</HI> &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them: con&s;equently they were not annihilated as you pretend, but are &s;till in being, and continue to be the &s;ervants of the Mo&s;t High. This argument was conclu&s;ive; it ef|fectually &s;ilenced the Sadducees, and agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed the people, to &s;ee the objection, hitherto thought impregnable, totally aboli&s;hed, and the &s;ect they had long abominated, fully confuted: <HI>And when the multitude heard this, they were a&s;toni&s;hed at his doctrine.</HI> Matt. xxii.33.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="029927_0199_0FE3382444689DC8">THOUGH the Phari&s;ees had joined with the Sadducees, in order to put our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour to death, they could not fail of being plea&s;ed to &s;ee their inveterate enemies put to &s;ilence, and the famous argument they had &s;o often propo&s;ed with o&s;tentations, as unan&s;werable, fully confuted. Nor could they refrain from giving the Saviour of man|kind the prai&s;e due to his &s;uperlative wi&s;dom; for one of the Scribes de&s;ired him to give his opinion, on a que&s;tion often debated among their teachers; namely, which was the great commandment of the law. The true rea&s;on for their propo&s;ing this que&s;tion, was to try whether he was as well acquainted with the &s;acred law, and the debates that had ari&s;en on different parts of it, as he was in deriving arguments from the in&s;pired writers to de&s;troy the tenets of tho&s;e who denied a future &s;tate.</P>
<P>IN order to under&s;tand the que&s;tion propo&s;ed to our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour by the Scribe, it mu&s;t be remembered, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t learned Rabbins had declared, that the law of &s;acrifices was the great commandment; &s;ome, that it was the law of circum|ci&s;ion; and others, that the law of meats and wa&s;hings had merited that title. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, however, &s;hewed that they were all mi&s;taken: and that the great commandment of the law is the duty of piety; and particularly mentioned that com|prehen&s;ive &s;ummary of it, given by Mo&s;es, <HI>Hear, O I&s;rael; the Lord our God is one Lord; and thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy &s;trength: this is the fir&s;t and great commandment.</HI> Mark xiii.29, 30.</P>
<P>HERE I cannot help ob&s;erving, that this &s;ummary of piety begins with an emphatical a&s;&s;ertion of there being only one God, the maker of heaven and earth, and the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or of all perfection, in order to induce us to u&s;e the utmo&s;t diligence in obeying his precepts; the fir&s;t and chief of which is, to give him our hearts. The Divine Being is &s;o tran&s;cendently amiable in him&s;elf, and hath by the innumerable benefits conferred upon us, &s;uch a title to our utmo&s;t affection, that no obligation bears any proportion to that of loving him. The honour a&s;&s;igned to this precept, proves that piety is the noble&s;t act of the human mind, and that the chief ingredient in piety is love, founded on a clear and exten&s;ive view of the divine perfections, a permanent &s;en&s;e of his benefits, and a deep conviction of his being the &s;overeign good&mdash;our portion&mdash;our happine&s;s: but it is e&s;&s;ential to love, that there be a delight in contemplating the beauty of the ob|ject beloved, whether that beauty be matter of &s;en&s;ation or reflection; that we frequently, and with plea&s;ure, reflect on the benefits conferred on us by the object of our affec|tions; that we have a &s;trong de&s;ire of plea&s;ing him, great fear of doing any thing to offend him, and a &s;en&s;ible joy in thinking we are beloved in return. Hence the duties of devotion, prayer, and prai&s;e, are the mo&s;t natural and genuine exerci&s;es of the love of God: nor is this virtue &s;o much any &s;ingle affection, as the continual bent of all the affections and powers of the &s;oul; con&s;equently to love God is as much as po&s;&s;ible to direct the whole &s;oul towards him, and to exerci&s;e all its faculties on him as its chief object. Accordingly, the love of God is de&s;cribed in &s;cripture, by the &s;everal ope|rations of the mind, <HI>a following hard after God,</HI> namely, by inten&s;e contemplation; a &s;en&s;e of his perfection, gratitude for his benefits, tru&s;t in his goodne&s;s, attachment to his &s;ervice, re&s;ignation to his providence, the obeying of his commandments, admiration, hope, fear, joy, &amp;c. not becau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts in any of tho&s;e &s;ingly, but in them altoge|ther: for to content our&s;elves with partial regards to the Supreme Being, is not to be affected towards him in the manner we ought to be, and which his perfections claim. Hence the words of the precept are, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy &s;trength;</HI> that is with the joint force of all thy faculties; and therefore, no idol what&s;oever mu&s;t partake of the love and wor&s;hip that is due to him alone.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="029927_0200_0FE3382C8AEFF128">BUT the beauty and excellency of this &s;tate of mind is be&s;t &s;een in its effects&punc; for the wor&s;hip and obedience flowing from &s;uch an univer&s;al bent of the &s;oul towards God, is as much &s;uperior to the wor&s;hip and obedience ari&s;ing from partial con&s;iderations, as the brightne&s;s of the &s;un is to any picture that can be drawn of that luminary. Thus, for example, if we look upon God, only as a &s;tern law-giver, who can and will puni&s;h our rebellion, it may, indeed, force an awe and dread of him, and as much obedience to his law as we think will &s;atisfy him, but can never produce that con&s;tancy in our duty, that delight in it, and that earne&s;tne&s;s to perform it in its utmo&s;t extent, which are produced and maintained in the mind, by the &s;acred fire of divine love, or by the bent of the whole &s;oul turned towards God: a frame that con&s;titutes the highe&s;t perfection and hap|pine&s;s of the creature, and, therefore, the mo&s;t excellent that can be conceived and the mo&s;t to be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould always earne&s;tly de&s;ire to be ble&s;&s;ed with the pre&s;ence of the Mo&s;t High, our &s;ouls &s;hould pant after him, as the hart panteth after the water-brooks, and even thir&s;t for the Living God. Again, this commandment requires us to fear God; and cer|tainly we cannot love the Lord our God, unle&s;s we fear and reverence him: for as the love, &s;o the fear of God, is the &s;um of all the commandments, and indeed, the &s;ub&s;tance of all religion. If we acknowledge there is a God, it is but rea&s;onable we &s;hould fear his e&s;&s;ential greatne&s;s and glory; for you open a pa&s;&s;&s;age for a deluge of villainy and wickedne&s;s, if you take away the fear of a Deity, and that of a Supreme. Power, that can reward and puni&s;h the actions of men.</P>
<P>IT is not enough that we love and fear the Mo&s;t High, we mu&s;t al&s;o call upon the name of God in our prayers and prai&s;es; love and fear, re&s;pect the inward wor&s;hip of God in our hearts, and by this act of outward wor&s;hip, we give an expre&s;s te&s;timony that we love and fear him: prayer and prai&s;es are the tribute and homage of religion, by the one we acknowledge our dependance upon God, by the other we confe&s;s, that all our ble&s;|&s;ings and comforts are from him. Such, therefore, as neither pray to God nor prai&s;e him, cannot be &s;aid to have a God, for they acknowledged none, but are gods to them&s;elves; and as the love and fear of God are often u&s;ed in &s;cripture for his whole wor&s;hip and &s;ervice, &s;o is this calling upon his name; <HI>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that knows thee not, and upon the families that have not called upon thy name,</HI> Jer. x.25.</P>
<P>But to return&mdash;Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour having thus an&s;wered the que&s;tion put to him by the Scribe, added, that the &s;econd commandment was that which enjoined the love of our neighbour. This had, indeed, no relation to the lawyer's que&s;tion concerning the fir&s;t commandment; yet our ble&s;&s;ed Lord thought proper to &s;hew him which was the &s;e|cond, probably becau&s;e the men of his &s;ect did not acknowledge the importance and pre|cedency of love to their neighbours, or becau&s;e they were remarkably deficient in the practice of it, as JESUS him&s;elf had often found in their attempts to kill him: <HI>And the &s;econd is like unto it, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>OUR natures mu&s;t be brought to a temper that is all love and goodne&s;s, if we would become like God, who is love; and if our &s;ouls dwell in love, then we dwell in God and God in us. This principle will be al&s;o fruitful in every good work; it will make us rea|dily perform the duties of all relations in which we &s;tand: and becau&s;e love worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore it is the fulfilling of the law; for it will prompt us to a cheerful and ready performance of every office, whether of ju&s;tice or charity, that we owe to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> neighbour: all the be&s;t things we can do, if de&s;titute of this principle, will appear to be either the effect of hypocri&s;y, or done to procure the e&s;teem of men: with|out love, a narrowne&s;s of &s;oul will &s;hut us up within our&s;elves, and make all we do to
<PB N="192" REF="029927_0201_0FE3382ED99C1378">
others only as a &s;ort of merchandize, trading for our own advantage: it is love only that opens our hearts to con&s;ider other per&s;ons, and to love them on their own account, or ra|ther on account of God, who is love.</P>
<P>THOSE who po&s;&s;e&s;s the effects of this excellent temper well de&s;erve our con&s;ideration: they have a con&s;tant calm within, and are not di&s;turbed with pa&s;&s;ion, jealou&s;y, envy, or ill-nature: they ob&s;erve and rejoice in the happine&s;s of others, they are glad to &s;ee them ea&s;y, and &s;hare with them in their joy and felicity, not fretting or complaining, though they enjoy le&s;s than their neighbours. It is true, love has a very different effect; for the &s;ame temper will render many &s;o con&s;iderate of the misfortunes of others, as to &s;ym|pathize with them in their di&s;tre&s;s and be greatly affected with &s;uch objects of compa&s;&s;ion as it is not in their power to a&s;&s;i&s;t: but there is a real plea&s;ure even in this compa&s;&s;ion, as it melts us into the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s, and proves us to be men and Chri&s;tians. The good man, by the overflowings of his love, is &s;ure that he is a favourite with his Maker, becau&s;e he loves his neighbour: his &s;oul, therefore dwells at ea&s;e; there is a &s;weetne&s;s in all his thoughts and wi&s;hes: this makes him clear in his views of things; no vapours, no clouds darken him, but an inward &s;erenity reigns in his mind, and &s;uch a liveline&s;s in all his thoughts, as &s;preads a cheerfulne&s;s in his looks, and renders him grateful to all about him.</P>
<P>A con&s;tant di&s;po&s;ition for prayer, is al&s;o maintained in him who has this charitable temper: a calm mind is ea&s;ily recollected; but nothing di&s;&s;ipates the thoughts more, and renders them le&s;s fixed and attentive than pa&s;&s;ion. A charitable man, who has had occa&s;ions to forbear and forgive others, and to return good for evil, dares, with an humble a&s;&s;urance to lay claim to mercy and pardon: for though he is ready to acknowledge, he is many talents indebted to his Maker; yet being of a forgiving tem|per, he has an argument to plead for mercy and forgivne&s;s, and to conclude that <HI>much will be forgiven him becau&s;e he loveth much.</HI> There is &s;uch a likene&s;s and &s;ympathy be|tween the &s;pirit of love, and the &s;pirit of true devotion, that they have a &s;en&s;ible influ|ence upon each other, and the one will ri&s;e or fall in proportion to the other.</P>
<P>BUT to return from this digre&s;&s;ion, which we flatter our&s;elves has not been di&s;agree|able to the reader, we &s;hall go back to the Scribe who was a&s;toni&s;hed at the ju&s;tne&s;s of our Saviour's deci&s;ions, and an&s;wered, that he had determined rightly &s;ince there is but one Supreme God, whom we mu&s;t all adore; and if we love him as much as we are able, and without a rival, and our neighbour as our&s;elves, we wor&s;hip him more accept|ably than if we &s;acrifice to him all the cattle upon a thou&s;and hills. And our Lord declared, that the per&s;on who made this reflection, was not far from the kingdom of God, and highly applauded the piety and wi&s;dom of it.</P>
<P>DURING the cour&s;e of our Saviour's mini&s;try, the Phari&s;ees having propo&s;ed to him many difficult que&s;tions with an intention to prove his prophetical gifts, he now, in his turn, thought proper to make a trial of their &s;kill in the &s;acred writings. For this purpo&s;e, he a&s;ked their opinion of a difficulty concerning the Me&s;&s;iah's pedigree: <HI>What think ye of Chri&s;t? Who&s;e &s;on is he? They &s;ay unto him, the &s;on of David,</HI> Matt. xxii.42. I know, an&s;wered JESUS, you &s;ay, CHRIST is the &s;on of David; but how can you &s;upport that opinion, or render it con&s;i&s;tent with the words of David, who him&s;elf calls him Lord; and <HI>how is he his &s;on?</HI> It &s;eems, that the Jewi&s;h doctors did not imagine that their Me&s;&s;iah would be endued with any perfections greater than tho&s;e that might be enjoyed by hu|man nature; for though they called him the Son of God, they had no notion that he was God, and therefore could not pretend to &s;olve the difficulty. The latter que&s;tion
<PB N="193" REF="029927_0202_0FE338305DFF1F78">
however, might have convinced them of their error; for if the Me&s;&s;iah was only to be a &s;ecular prince as they &s;uppo&s;ed, and to rule over the men of his own time, he never could have been called <HI>Lord,</HI> by per&s;ons who died before he was born; far le&s;s would &s;o migh|ty a prince as David, who was al&s;o his progenitor, have conferred on him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itle. Since, therefore, he not only rules over the vulgar dead of former ages, but even over the kings from whom he was him&s;elf de&s;cended, and his kingdom comprehends the men of all countries and times, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come; the doctors, if they had thought accu|rately upon the &s;ubject, &s;hould have expected in their Me&s;&s;iah a king different from all other kings whatever: be&s;ides, he is to &s;it at God's right hand, <HI>till all his enemies are made his foot&s;tool.</HI> Numbers of CHRIST's enemies are &s;ubject to him in this life: and they who will not bow to him willingly, &s;hall be reduced by puni&s;hment, like the rebellious &s;ubjects of other kingdoms.</P>
<P>HE returned &s;uch clear and &s;olid an&s;wers to the en&s;naring que&s;tions of his adver&s;aries, that they gave the people an high opinion of his wi&s;dom; and &s;hewed them, how far &s;uperior he was to their mo&s;t renowned Rabbins, who&s;e argument to prove their opinions, and an&s;wers to the objections which were rai&s;ed again&s;t him, were, in general, very weak and trifling: nay, his foes them&s;elves, from the repeated proofs they had received from the prodigious depth of his under&s;tanding, were impre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch an opinion of his wi&s;dom, that they judged it impo&s;&s;ible to entangle him in his talk. Ac|cordingly, they left off attempting it, and troubled him no more with their in&s;idious que&s;tions from that day.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;ilenced his mo&s;t virulent oppo&s;ers by this means; but having mentioned the final conque&s;t and de&s;truction of his enemies, who were to be made his foot&s;tool, agreeable to the prediction of the royal P&s;almi&s;t, he turned towards his di&s;|ciples, and in the hearing of the multitude, &s;olemnly cautioned them to beware of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees; in&s;inuating thereby, who the enemies were who&s;e de&s;truction he had mentioned: <HI>The Scribes and Phari&s;ees,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;it in Mo&s;es's &s;eat: all therefore what&s;oever they bid you ob&s;erve, that ob&s;erve and do; but do not ye after their works: for they &s;ay and do not.</HI> Matt. xxiii.2, 3. While they teach the doctrines before delivered by Mo&s;es, ob&s;erve all they &s;ay, but by no means imitate their practices; for they impo&s;e many precepts on their di&s;ciples, which they never perform them&s;elves: <HI>For they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's &s;houlders; but they them&s;elves will not move them with one of their fingers. But all their works they do for to be &s;een of men.</HI> The difficult precepts they impo&s;e on others are never regarded by the&s;e hypocrites, and any good action they may happen to perform, is vitiated by the principle from whence it proceeds: they do it only with a view to popular applau&s;e, and not from a regard to God, far le&s;s from a love of goodne&s;s: they are proud and arrogant to ex|ce&s;s, as is plain from their affected gravity in their clothes, from the anxiety they di&s;|cover, le&s;t they &s;hould not obtain the principal &s;eats in the public a&s;&s;emblies, and from their affecting to be &s;aluted in the &s;treets, with the &s;ounding titles of Rabbi and Father: 'They make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermo&s;t rooms at fea&s;ts, and the chief &s;eats in the &s;ynagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.'</P>
<P>THE proper meaning of the word Rabbi is great, and it was given to tho&s;e men who had rendered them&s;elves remarkable for the extent of their learning; it is there|fore no wonder that the proud and &s;upercilious Phari&s;ees were &s;o fond of a title, which gave them great authority with their di&s;ciples, and highly complimented their under|&s;tandings.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="029927_0203_0FE33831E57FF9C0">BUT our Lord's followers were to decline this title, becau&s;e the thing &s;ignified by it belonged &s;olely to their Ma&s;ter, in whom are hid all the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and know|ledge; and becau&s;e they owed no part of their knowledge to them&s;elves, but derived it entirely from him who came down from heaven: 'But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Ma&s;ter, even CHRIST; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven,' Matt. xiii.8, 9. Life, with all its ble&s;&s;ings, comes from God, and men wholly depend upon him; all prai&s;e and thankfulne&s;s, therefore, &s;hould ultimately be referred to him; &s;o that if any one teacheth rightly, not the teacher, but the wi&s;dom of the Almighty is to be prai&s;ed, which exerts and communicates it&s;elf by him.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour were likewi&s;e enjoined not to accept of the title of ma&s;ter or leader, which the Jewi&s;h doctors al&s;o courted; becau&s;e in point of com|mi&s;&s;ion, and in&s;piration, they were all equal, neither had they any title to rule the con|&s;ciences of men, except by virtue of the in&s;piration which they had received from their Ma&s;ter, to whom alone the prerogative of infallibility belonged: <HI>Neither be ye called ma&s;ters: for one is your Ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour did not intend by this to in&s;inuate, that it was &s;inful to call men by the &s;tations they held in the world; he only intended to reprove the &s;implicity of the common people, who loaded their teachers with prai&s;es, and forgot to a&s;cribe any thing to God; and to root out of the minds of his apo&s;tles, the Phari&s;aical vanity, which decked it&s;elf with honours belonging &s;olely to the Creator of the uni|ver&s;e. Accordingly, that he might in&s;til into their hearts humility, to di&s;po&s;e them to do good offices to one another, as occa&s;ion offered, he a&s;&s;ured them, it was the only road to true greatne&s;s: for, by a&s;&s;uming what did not properly belong to them, they &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed both by God and men; whereas, they &s;hould enjoy a high degree of the divine favour, who did not di&s;dain to perform the meane&s;t offices of love to their brethren.</P>
<P>THE Scribes and Phari&s;ees were greatly incen&s;ed at the above di&s;cour&s;es; and, as they were pronounced in the hearing of many of that order, it is therefore no wonder that they watched every opportunity to de&s;troy him: but this was not a time to put their bloody de&s;igns in execution; the people &s;et too high a value on his doctrine to &s;uffer any violence to be offered to his per&s;on; and, as this was the la&s;t &s;ermon he was ever to preach in public, and as all his mild per&s;ua&s;ions had hitherto proved inef|fectual, it was nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould now u&s;e &s;ome &s;everity.</P>
<P>HE accordingly denounced in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, dreadful woes again&s;t them, not on account of the per&s;onal injuries he had received from them, but on account of their exce&s;&s;ive wickedne&s;s. They were public teachers of religion; and therefore &s;hould have u&s;ed every method in their power to recommend its precepts to the people, and to have been them&s;elves &s;hining examples of every duty it enjoined: but, on the con|trary, they abu&s;ed every mark and character of goodne&s;s for all the purpo&s;es of vil|lainy; and, under the cloak of a &s;evere and &s;anctified a&s;pect, they were malicious, im|placable, lewd, covetous, and rapacious: in a word, in&s;tead of being reformers, they were the corrupters of the people, and con&s;equently their wickedne&s;s de&s;erved the greate&s;t reproof that could be given by the great Redeemer of mankind: <HI>Woe unto you, Scribes and Phari&s;ees, hypocrites! for ye &s;hut up the kingdom of heaven again&s;t men; for ye neither go in your&s;elves, neither &s;uffer ye them that are entering to go in. Woe unto you Scribes and Phari&s;ees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' hou&s;es, and for a pretence make long prayers;

therefore ye &s;hall receive the greater damnation. Woe unto you Scribes and Phari&s;ees, hypocrites! for ye compa&s;s &s;ea and land to make one pro&s;elyte, and when he is made, ye make him two-fold more the child of hell than your&s;elves,</HI> Matt. xxiii.13, &amp;c.</P>
<P>YOU &s;hall &s;uffer puni&s;hment that will be terribly &s;evere, becau&s;e ye have given a wrong interpretation of the ancient prophecies concerning the Me&s;&s;iah, and done all that is in your power to hinder the people from repenting of their &s;ins, and believing the go&s;pel; becau&s;e you have committed the gro&s;&s;e&s;t iniquities, and under the cloak of religion, have devoured the &s;ub&s;tance of widows and orphans, hoping to hide your villanies by long prayers: bacau&s;e ye have expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t zeal imaginable in making pro&s;elytes, not with a view to render the Gentiles more wi&s;e and virtuous, but to acquire their riches, and a command over their con&s;ciences; and in&s;tead of teach|ing them the precepts of virtue and the moral duties of religion, you confine their duties to &s;uper&s;titious and ceremonial in&s;titutions, and hence they often relap&s;e into their old &s;tate of heatheni&s;m, and become more wicked than before their conver&s;ion, and con&s;equently liable to a more &s;evere &s;entence.</P>
<P>OUR Lord al&s;o mentioned, in a particular manner, their doctrine concerning oaths; and declared in oppo&s;ition to their abominable tenets, that every oath, if the matter of it be lawful, is obligatory; becau&s;e when men &s;wear by any part of the creation, it is an appeal to the Creator him&s;elf; for, in any other light, an oath of this kind is ab|&s;olutely ridiculous, the object having neither knowledge of the fact, nor power to puni&s;h the perjury: 'Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which &s;ay, who&s;oever &s;hall &s;wear by the temple, it is nothing; but who&s;oever &s;hall &s;wear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor! Ye fools and blind, whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that &s;anctifieth the gold? And, who&s;oever &s;hall &s;wear by the altar, it is nothing; but who&s;oever &s;wear|eth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty!

And who&s;o &s;hall &s;wear by heaven, &s;weareth by the throne of God, and by him that &s;itteth thereon.'</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour al&s;o upbraided them with their &s;uper&s;titious practices, in ob&s;erv|ing the minute&s;t parts of the ceremonial precepts of the law, and at the &s;ame time utterly neglecting the eternal and indi&s;pen&s;able rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s: <HI>Woe unto you, Scribes and Phari&s;ees, hypocrites! for ye pay tythe of mint, and ani&s;e and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: the&s;e ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</HI></P>
<P>THE Son of God al&s;o took notice of their hypocri&s;y; for they &s;pared no pains to appear virtuous in the eyes of the world, and maintain an external conduct that &s;hould require the prai&s;es of men; but, at the &s;ame time neglected to adorn their &s;ouls with the robe of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is the only ornament that can render them dear in the &s;ight of their Maker: Woe unto you, Scribes and Phari&s;ees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the out&s;ide of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and exce&s;s.

Clean&s;e fir&s;t thy mind, thy inward man, from evil di&s;po&s;itions and affections, and thy outward behaviour will of cour&s;e be virtu|ous and prai&s;e-worthy.</P>
<P>OUR dear Lord al&s;o animadverted upon the &s;ucce&s;s of their hypocri&s;y: they deceived the &s;imple and unthinking part of mankind, with their pretended &s;anctity, appearing like whited &s;epulchres, beautiful on the out&s;ide, while their internal parts were full of

uncleanne&s;s: 'Woe unto you, Scribes and Phari&s;ees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited &s;epulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead mens' bones, and of all uncleanne&s;s. Even &s;o ye al&s;o outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocri&s;y and iniquity.'</P>
<P>HE al&s;o cen&s;ured them for the pains they had taken in adorning the &s;epulchres of the prophets, becau&s;e they pretended a great veneration for their memory, and even condemned their fathers who killed them, &s;aying, that if they had lived in the days of their fathers, they would have oppo&s;ed &s;uch mon&s;trous wickedne&s;s, while, at the &s;ame time, all their actions abundantly proved, that they &s;till cheri&s;hed the &s;ame &s;pirit they condemned in their fathers, per&s;ecuting the me&s;&s;engers of the Mo&s;t High, particularly his only begotten Son, whom they were determined to de&s;troy: <HI>Woe unto you, Scribes and Phari&s;ees, hypocrites! becau&s;e ye build the tombs of the prophets, and gerni&s;h the &s;epulchres of the righteous, and &s;ay, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been parta|kers with them in the blood of the prophets. Wherefore ye be witne&s;&s;es unto your&s;elves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.</HI></P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour added, that the Divine Being was de&s;irous of trying every me|thod for their conver&s;ion, though all the&s;e in&s;tances of mercy were &s;lighted; and there|fore, they mu&s;t expect &s;uch terrible vengeance, as &s;hould be a &s;tanding monument of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t all the murders committed by the &s;ons of men, from the foun|dation of the world.</P>
<P>THUS having laid before them their heinous guilt and dreadful puni&s;hment; he was at the thought of the calamities which were &s;oon to fall upon them, exceedingly moved, and his brea&s;t filled with &s;en&s;ations of pity to &s;uch a degree, that unable to contain him|&s;elf, he broke forth into tears, bewailing the hard lot of the city of Jeru&s;alem; for as its inhabitants had more deeply imbrued their hands in the blood of the prophets they were to drink more deeply of the puni&s;hment due to &s;uch crimes: <HI>O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, thou that kille&s;t the prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them which are &s;ent unto thee; how often would I have ga|thered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your hou&s;e is left unto you de&s;olate.</HI></P>
<P>THIS exclamation of the benevolent Redeemer of mankind, is &s;uch as can hardly be read without a tear, and conveys a &s;trong idea of his love for that ungreatful nation. How often had the Almighty called upon them to return from their evil way, before he &s;ent his only begotten Son into the world! How often, how emphatically did the compa&s;|&s;ionate JESUS entreat them to embrace the merciful terms now offered them by the Almighty! And with what unconquerable ob&s;tinacy did they refu&s;e the benevolent offers, and re&s;i&s;t the mo&s;t winning expre&s;&s;ions of the divine love! By the word <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour meant the temple, which was from that time to be left unto them de&s;olate; the glory of the Lord, which Haggai had prophe&s;ied &s;hould fill the &s;econd hou&s;e, was now departing from it: adding, 'I &s;ay unto you, ye &s;hall not &s;ee me henceforth, till ye &s;hall &s;ay, Ble&s;&s;ed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. As if he had &s;aid, As ye have killed the prophets, and &s;toned them whom the Father hath &s;ent from the courts of heaven, and will &s;hortly put me, who am the Lord of the temple, to death; your holy hou&s;e &s;hall be left de&s;olate, and your nation totally de&s;erted by me; nor &s;hall you &s;ee me any more till the whole nation is converted to Chri&s;tianity, when all the de&s;cendants of Jacob &s;hall, with one voice, cry out, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord,</HI> as the multitude lately did.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="029927_0206_0FE3383EF20148E8">IN this manner, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS &s;tripped the Scribes and Phari&s;ees of their hypocri|tical ma&s;k. He treated them with &s;everity, becau&s;e their crimes were of the blacke&s;t dye; and hence we &s;hould learn to be really good, and not flatter our&s;elves that we can cover our crimes from that piercing eye to which nothing is concealed with the cloak of hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>AT the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, the people could not fail of being a&s;toni&s;hed, as they had always con&s;idered their teachers as the mo&s;t righteous among the &s;ons of men; nay the per&s;ons them&s;elves, again&s;t whom they were levelled, were confounded, becau&s;e their own con|&s;ciences convinced them of the truth of every thing laid to their charge. They therefore knew not what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue; and they let JESUS depart without making any attempt to &s;eize him, or inflict on him any kind of puni&s;hment, being prevented from putting their wicked purpo&s;es into practice until the work was fini&s;hed for which he was &s;ent of his Father into the world to do.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CHRIST</HI> valueth the poor Widow's two Mites above all the gifts of the Rich: He foretelleth the De|&s;truction of the Temple; &s;heweth what Signs and Calamities &s;hould go before, and what &s;hould happen at the Time of his Coming: He delivers the Parable of the ten Virgins; and of the Talents, which a King di&s;tributed among his Servants, to be improved by them: and in a third Parable, delivered at the &s;ame Time, he gives a De&s;cription of the la&s;t Judgment.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER our dear Lord had expo&s;ed the &s;ecret practices of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, he repaired with his di&s;ciples unto the court of the woman, called the trea&s;ury, from &s;everal che&s;ts being fixed to the pillars of the portico &s;urrounding the court for receiving the offerings of tho&s;e who came to wor&s;hip in the temple. While he conti|nued in this court 'He beheld how the people ca&s;t money into the trea&s;ury: and many that were rich ca&s;t in much. And there came a certain poor widow, and &s;he threw in two mites, which make a farthing. And he called unto him his di&s;ciples, and &s;aith unto them, Verily I &s;ay unto you, that this poor widow hath ca&s;t more in, than all they which have ca&s;t into the trea&s;ury; for all they did ca&s;t in of their abundance; but &s;he of her want did ca&s;t in all that &s;he had, even all her living.' Mark xii.41, 42, 43, 44.</P>
<P>THIS poor widow's offering was, in it&s;elf, very &s;mall, yet, in proportion to the goods &s;he enjoyed, it was remarkably large; for it was all &s;he had, even all her living. In order, therefore, to encourage charity, and &s;hew that it is the di&s;po&s;ition of the mind, not the magnificence of the offering, that attracted the regard of the Almighty, the Son of God applauded this poor widow, as having given more in proportion than any of the rich. Their offerings, though great in re&s;pect of her's, were but a &s;mall part of their e&s;tates, whereas, her offering was her whole &s;tock. And from this pa&s;&s;age of the go&s;pel, we &s;hould learn, that the poor, who in appearance are denied the means of doing charitable offices, are encouraged to do all they can; for how &s;mall &s;oever the gift may be, the Almighty who beholds the heart, values it, not according to what it is in it&s;elf, but according to the di&s;po&s;ition with which it is given. On the other hand, we &s;hould learn from hence, that it is not enough for the rich, that they exceed the poor in their gifts of charity, they &s;hould be&s;tow in proportion to their fortune; and they
<PB N="198" REF="029927_0207_0FE3384075B972D0">
would do well to remember, that a little given, where a little only is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, appears a much nobler offering in the &s;ight of the Almighty, and di&s;covers a more benevolent and humane temper of mind, than a greater &s;um out of the abundance of the rich.</P>
<P>OUR Lord having declared, at the conclu&s;ion of his pathetic lamentation over Jeru|&s;alem, that the temple &s;hould not any more be favoured with his pre&s;ence, till they &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:</HI> which declaration greatly &s;ur|pri&s;ed his di&s;ciples; and therefore, as he was departing from that &s;acred &s;tructure, they de&s;ired him to ob&s;erve the beauty of the building, in&s;inuating, that they thought it &s;trange he &s;hould intimate an intention of leaving it de&s;olate; that &s;o glorious a fabric, celebrated in every corner of the earth, was not to be de&s;erted ra&s;hly; and that they &s;hould think them&s;elves &s;upremely happy, when he, as the Me&s;&s;iah, and de&s;cendent of David, &s;hould take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and erect his throne in the mid&s;t of Jeru&s;alem: <HI>And as he went out of the temple, one of his di&s;ciples &s;aith unto him, Ma&s;ter, &s;ee what manner of &s;tones, and what buildings are here!</HI> The ea&s;tern wall of the temple, which fronted the Mount of Olives, whither the di&s;ciples, with their ma&s;ter, were then retiring, was built from the bottom of the valley to a prodigious height, with &s;tones of an incredible bulk, firmly compacted together, and, therefore, made a very grand appearance at a di&s;tance. This ea&s;tern wall is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the only remains of Solomon's temple, and had e&s;caped when the Chaldeans burnt it: but this building, however co&s;tly or &s;trange it appeared, our Saviour told them &s;hould be totally de&s;troyed: 'See&s;t thou', &s;aid he, 'the&s;e great buildings? There &s;hall not be left one &s;tone upon another, that &s;hall not be thrown down.' Mark xiii.2.</P>
<P>THIS venerable &s;tructure, which you behold with wonder, adorned with huge &s;tones of amazing beauty, &s;hall be razed to the very foundation. The di&s;ciples, therefore, when they heard their Ma&s;ter affirm, that not &s;o much as one of the&s;e enormous &s;tones, which had mocked the fury of of Nebuchadnezzar's army, and &s;urvived the de&s;tructive hand of time, was to be left one upon another, they perceived that the whole temple was to be demoli&s;hed, but did not &s;u&s;pect that the &s;acrifices were to be taken away, and a new religion introduced, which rendered the temple unnece&s;&s;ary. They therefore, flattered them&s;elves, that the fabric then &s;tanding, however glorious it might appear, was too &s;mall for the numerous wor&s;hippers who would frequent it, when all the nations of the world were &s;ubject to the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, and was, therefore, to be pulled down, in order to be erected on a more magnificent plan, &s;uitable to the idea they had conceived of his future empire. Filled with the&s;e plea&s;ing imaginations, they received the news with plea|&s;ure, meditating as they walked to the mountain, on the glorious things which were &s;hortly to come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as they arrived at the Mount of Olives, and their ma&s;ter had taken his &s;eat on &s;ome eminence, from whence they had a pro&s;pect of the temple and part of the city, his di&s;ciples drew near, to know when the demolition of the old &s;tructure was to happen, and what were to be the &s;igns of his coming, and of the end of the world: <HI>And as he &s;at upon the mount of Olives, the di&s;ciples came unto him privately, &s;aying, tell us when &s;hall the&s;e things be? and what &s;hall be the &s;ign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?</HI> Matt. xxiv.3.</P>
<P>IT is probable the di&s;ciples meant what &s;igns &s;hould precede the erection of that exten|&s;ive empire, over which they &s;uppo&s;ed the Me&s;&s;iah was to reign; for they &s;till expected he would govern a &s;ecular kingdom. They therefore, connected the demolition of the temple with their Ma&s;ter's coming, though they had not the lea&s;t notion that he was to
<PB N="199" REF="029927_0208_0FE3384B5B32E7E8">
de&s;troy the nation; and change from the religious wor&s;hip. They, therefore, meant by <HI>the end of the world,</HI> or, as the words &s;hould have been tran&s;lated, <HI>the end of the age,</HI> the period of the political government then executed by Heathen procurators, and con&s;ider|ed their Ma&s;ter's coming to de&s;troy the con&s;titution then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, as a very de&s;irable event: they al&s;o thought the demolition of the temple proper, as they expected a larger and more &s;uperb building would be erected in its &s;tead, in proportion to the number of the Me&s;&s;iah's &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>IT will &s;ufficiently appear, that this is the real &s;en&s;e of the di&s;ciples que&s;tion, if we con&s;ider, that they were delighted with the pro&s;pect; whereas, if they had meant by the end of the world, the final period of all things, the de&s;truction of the temple would have exhibited to them a melancholy pro&s;pect, which they could not have beheld, without a deep concern, in their pre&s;ent temper of mind.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord was careful to convince them of their mi&s;take, by tel|ling them, that he was not come to rule a &s;ecular empire, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, but to puni&s;h the Jews for their perfidy and rebellion, by de&s;troying both their temple and nation: <HI>Take heed,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that no man deceive you. For many &s;hall come in my name, &s;aying, I am Chri&s;t, and &s;hall deceiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> many.</HI> This caution was far from being unnece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, though the di&s;ciples were to &s;ee their Ma&s;ter a&s;cend into heaven, they might take occa|&s;ion from the prophecy, to think that he would appear again on earth, and, therefore, be in danger of &s;eduction by the fal&s;e Chri&s;ts that &s;hould ari&s;e: And when ye &s;hall hear of wars and rumours of wars, &s;ee that ye be not troubled; for all the&s;e things mu&s;t come to pa&s;s; but the end is not yet. Before this nation and temple are de&s;troyed, terrible wars will happen in the land: 'For nation &s;hall ri&s;e again&s;t nation, and kingdom again&s;t kingdom; and there &s;hall be famines, and pe&s;tilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.'</P>
<P>THESE things are but the beginning of a long &s;eries of calamities: which &s;hall fall upon this nation: at the &s;ame time you &s;hall meet with hot per&s;ecutions; walk, there|fore, circum&s;pectly, and arm your&s;elves both with patience and fortitude, that ye may be able to perform your duty through the whole cour&s;e of the&s;e per&s;ecutions: for you &s;hall be brought before the great men of the earth for my &s;ake: 'But when they &s;hall lead you and deliver you up, take no thought before hand what ye &s;hall &s;peak, neither do ye premeditate: but what&s;oever &s;hall be given you in that hour, that &s;peak ye; for it is not ye that &s;peak, but the Holy Gho&s;t.' Mark. xiii.11.</P>
<P>OUR Lord told them, during this time of trouble and confu&s;ion, the perfidy of man|kind &s;hall be &s;o great towards one another, <HI>that brother &s;hall betray the brother to death, and the father the &s;on; and children &s;hall ri&s;e up again&s;t their parents, and &s;hall cau&s;e them to be put to death.</HI> The unbelieving Jews and apo&s;tate Chri&s;tians, &s;hall commit &s;uch crimes, that the very idea of which, &s;hall excite horror in the mo&s;t barbarous nations. It is, therefore, no wonder that the perfidy and wickedne&s;s of &s;uch pretended Chri&s;tians, &s;hall di&s;courage many di&s;ciples and greatly hinder the propagation of the go&s;pel: but he who &s;upports his faith during the&s;e per&s;ecutions, and is not led a&s;tray by the &s;educ|tion of fal&s;e Chri&s;tians, &s;hall e&s;cape that terrible de&s;truction which will overflow the land like a deluge.</P>
<P>MY di&s;ciples &s;hall be &s;cattered by the&s;e per&s;ecutions and tribulations, and &s;hall preach the go&s;pel in all parts of the Roman empire; and then &s;hall the period you now inquire after arrive: then &s;hall the Almighty ari&s;e to vengeance, and con&s;ume, in his anger, this &s;tiff-necked generation.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="029927_0209_0FE3384CEC7512B0">AT the time when Jeru&s;alem &s;hall be &s;urrounded with armies, Pagan armies bearing in their &s;tandards the images of their gods, the <HI>abomination of de&s;olation,</HI> mentioned by the prophet Daniel; then let him who readeth the predictions of that prophet under|&s;tand, that the end of the city and &s;anctuary, together with the cea&s;ing of the &s;acrifice and oblation there predicted, is come, and, of cour&s;e, the final period of the Jewi&s;h go|vernment.</P>
<P><HI>THEN let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the mid&s;t of it depart out;</HI> Luke xxi.21. <HI>Let him which is on the the hou&s;e-top, not come down to take any thing out of his hou&s;e: neither let him which is in the field, return back to take his clothes,</HI> Matt. xxiv.17, 18. For the Almighty will now puni&s;h this nation for its &s;in: the&s;e are the days of his vengeance, when all the threatenings of the prophets, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Daniel, &s;hall be inflicted on this ob&s;tinate and rebellious people.</P>
<P>THE women who are with child, and they who have infants hanging at their brea&s;ts, &s;hall be particularly unhappy in tho&s;e days of vengeance, becau&s;e they cannot flee from the impending de&s;truction: <HI>But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter,</HI> when the bad|ne&s;s of the roads and the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, will render &s;peedy travelling very trouble|&s;ome, if not impo&s;&s;ible; <HI>neither on the Sabbath-day,</HI> when you &s;hall think it unlawful, <HI>for then &s;hall be great tribulation, &s;uch as was not &s;ince the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever &s;hall be.</HI> This is confirmed by what Jo&s;ephus tells us: for he &s;ays. 'that no le&s;s than eleven hundred thou&s;and peri&s;hed in the &s;iege.'</P>
<P>OUR dear Lord added, that except the days of tribulation &s;hould be &s;hortened, none of the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem and Judea, of whom he was then &s;peaking, &s;hould e&s;cape de|&s;truction. And accordingly Jo&s;ephus tells us, that the quarrels which raged during the &s;iege, were &s;o fierce and ob&s;tinate, both within the walls of Jeru&s;alem, and without in the neighbouring country, that the whole land was one continued &s;cene of horror and de&s;o|lation: and had the &s;iege continued much longer, the whole nation of the Jews had been totally de&s;troyed, according to our Lord's prediction: <HI>But,</HI> added our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour, <HI>for the elect's &s;ake, whom he hath cho&s;en, he hath &s;hortened the days.</HI> By the elect are meant, &s;uch of the Jews as had embraced the doctrines of the go&s;pel, and tho&s;e who were brought in with the fullne&s;s of the Gentiles particularly.</P>
<P>DURING this time of univer&s;al confu&s;ion, it was natural to think, that the expecta|tions of the whole nation would be turned towards their Me&s;&s;iah; for if he was ever to appear, it mu&s;t be then, to deliver them from impending de&s;truction. Our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour therefore cautioned his di&s;ciples not to li&s;ten to any pretences of that kind, as ma|ny fal&s;e Chri&s;ts would ari&s;e, and deceive great numbers of the people. A prediction that was fully accompli&s;hed during the terrible &s;iege of Jeru&s;alm by the Romans: for Jo&s;ephus tells us, that many aro&s;e, pretending to be the Me&s;&s;iah, boa&s;ting that they would deliver the nation from all its enemies. And the multitude, always too prone to li&s;ten to deceivers who promi&s;e temporal advantages, gave credit to tho&s;e deceivers, be|came more ob&s;tinate in their oppo&s;ition to the Romans, and thereby rendered their de&s;|truction more &s;evere and more inevitable. And what &s;till increa&s;ed the infatuation of the people, was their performing wonderful things during the war; and accordingly Jo&s;ephus calls them magicians and &s;orcerers. Hence we &s;ee the propriety of the cau|tion given by the Son of God, who foretold that, <HI>they &s;hould &s;hew great &s;igns and won|ders; in&s;omuch that, if it were po&s;&s;ible, they would deceive the very elect. But take ye heed; behold, I have foretold you all things.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="029927_0210_0FE3384E72D1B078">BUT as it was likely the partizans of the fal&s;e Chri&s;ts would pretend that the Me&s;&s;iah was concealed a while for fear of the Romans, and the weaker &s;ort of Chri&s;tians, with|out this warning, might have imagined, that Chri&s;t was actually returned, to deliver the nation in its extremity, and to puni&s;h their enemies, who now &s;o cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed them, and that he would &s;hew him&s;elf as &s;oon as it is proper, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour thought it needful to caution them again&s;t this particular: <HI>Wherefore, if they &s;hould &s;ay unto you, Behold, he is in the de&s;ert; go not forth: behold, he is in the &s;ecret chambers: believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the Ea&s;t, and &s;hineth even unto the We&s;t; &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the coming of the Son of man be.</HI> Matt. xxiv.26, 27.</P>
<P>AS lightning is &s;wift and de&s;tructive, &s;o &s;hall the coming of the Son of man be. But he will not come per&s;onally, his &s;ervants only &s;hall come, the Roman armies, who &s;hall de&s;troy this nation, as eagles devour their prey, by his command.</P>
<P>THUS having given them a particular account of the various circum&s;tances which &s;hould precede the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, he next de&s;cribed that cata&s;trophe it&s;elf, in all the pomp of language and imagery made u&s;e of by the ancient prophets, when they foretold the de&s;truction of cities and kingdoms: <HI>But in tho&s;e days, after that tribulation, the &s;un &s;hall be darkened, and the moon &s;hall not give her light, and the &s;tars of heaven &s;hall fall, and the powers that are in heaven &s;hall be &s;haken. And upon the earth di&s;tre&s;s of nations, with perplexity; the &s;ea and the waves roaring; mens' hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after tho&s;e things which are coming on the earth.</HI></P>
<P>THESE expre&s;&s;ions are figurative and lofty, and &s;ignify the decaying of all the glory, excellency, and pro&s;perity of the nation, and the introduction of univer&s;al &s;adne&s;s, mi&s;ery, and confu&s;ion. The roaring of the &s;ea, and the waves, may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as metaphorical, as the &s;igns in the &s;un, in the moon, and in the &s;tars are plainly &s;o. And by the powers of heaven are meant the whole Jewi&s;h polity, government, laws, and religion, which were the work of heaven; the&s;e, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour tells us, &s;hould be &s;haken.</P>
<P>AS the di&s;ciples, in conformity to the repeated que&s;tions of the Phari&s;ees during his mini&s;try, had a&s;ked what would be the &s;igns of his coming. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour told them, that after the tribulation of tho&s;e days, when the &s;un &s;hould be darkened, and all the enemies of the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould mourn, they &s;hould &s;ee the accompli&s;hment of what Daniel foretold, by the figurative expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven;</HI> for they &s;hould behold the &s;ignal puni&s;hments executed on the Jewi&s;h nation, by the Roman armies, &s;ent for that end by the Son of man, who &s;hall thus glo|riou&s;ly demon&s;trate the greatne&s;s of his power, and the extent of his dominion: <HI>Then &s;hall appear the &s;ign of the Son of man in heaven: and then &s;hall all the tribes of the earth mourn. And they &s;hall &s;ee the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.</HI></P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples were to con&s;ider the time of their redemption, from the oppre&s;&s;ion under which they then groaned, as near at hand when the&s;e things came to pa&s;s: and that they might be certain this prophecy would not long wait for its accompli&s;hment, he told them that the pre&s;ent generation &s;hould not all be laid in the chambers of the du&s;t, before the&s;e terrible calamities &s;hould fall upon Jeru&s;alem. Adding, that his di&s;ciples might &s;ooner expect the di&s;&s;olution of the whole frame of nature, than that one &s;ingle circum&s;tance of this prophecy &s;hould fail of its accompli&s;hment: 'Verily I &s;ay unto you, This gene|ration &s;hall not pa&s;s, till all the&s;e things be fulfilled. Heaven and earth &s;hall pa&s;s away, but my words &s;hall not pa&s;s away.'</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="029927_0211_0FE3384FFA282348">IF we take the pains to campare the prediction of our Saviour with the hi&s;tory Jo&s;e|phus wrote of the war, we cannot fail of being &s;truck with the wi&s;dom of CHRIST, and acknowledge that his prediction was truly divine. For as the Jewi&s;h nation was at this time in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tate, the event here told was altogether improbable. Be|&s;ides, the circum&s;tances of the de&s;truction are very numerous, and &s;urpri&s;ingly par|ticular; and the whole delivered without any ambiguity. It is therefore a prophecy of &s;uch a kind, as could never have been uttered by any impo&s;ter, and con&s;equently the per&s;on who delivered it, was truly divine, and acquainted with the &s;ecret coun&s;els of heaven.</P>
<P>BUT it has been demanded with &s;ome a&s;&s;urance, by the enemies to revelation, why &s;hould CHRIST order his di&s;ciples not to flee from Jeru&s;alem, till they &s;aw it encompa&s;&s;ed with the Roman army, when it would then be impo&s;&s;ible for them to make their e&s;cape? But per&s;ons, before they propo&s;e &s;uch que&s;tions, would do well to read attentively the hi&s;tory Jo&s;ephus has given us of the&s;e terrible calamities: becau&s;e they would there find a &s;olution of that difficulty. That hi&s;torian tells us, "That Ce&s;tius Gallus, &s;ur|rounded the city with his army; and at the time when he could ea&s;ily have taken the city, &s;uddenly withdrew his forces, without any apparent rea&s;on." He adds, "that as &s;oon as the &s;iege was rai&s;ed, many eminent Jews fled from it, as from a &s;inking &s;hip." In all probability, many of the&s;e were Chri&s;tians, who being warned by this prophecy of their great Ma&s;ter, &s;aved them&s;elves by flight, as he had directed. Thus we &s;ee what frivolous objections are made by the free-thinkers of our age, again&s;t the truth of the &s;acred writings, and how ea&s;ily they are an&s;wered. And I cannot help ob&s;erving, that this conduct of the Roman general, &s;o contrary to all the rules of prudence, mu&s;t have been brought to pa&s;s by the providence of God, who interpo&s;ed for the deliverance of the di&s;ciples in this manner.</P>
<P>HAVING given this de&s;cription of the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour enumerated a great variety of particulars that were to precede or accompany it, a&s;&s;uring his di&s;ciples, that it would be very unexpected, and thence urged the nece&s;&s;ity of a watch|ful vigilance, le&s;t they &s;hould be &s;urpri&s;ed, and have a &s;hare in tho&s;e terrible calamities: <HI>But as the days of Noe were, &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the coming of the Son of man be.</HI> Matt. xxiv.37. <HI>Watch ye therefore; for ye know not when the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e cometh; at even, or at mid|night, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning; le&s;t coming &s;uddenly, he find you &s;leeping.</HI> Mark xiii.35, 36.</P>
<P>AS men were to undergo, at the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, nearly the &s;ame mi&s;eries, and as the pa&s;&s;ions which its approach would rai&s;e in their minds, were &s;imilar to tho&s;e which will happen at the de&s;truction of the world, and the general judgment; it was natural for our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, on this occa&s;ion, to put his di&s;ciples in mind of that judgment, and to exhort them to the faithful di&s;charge of their duty, from the con&s;ide|ration of the &s;uddenne&s;s of his coming to call every individual to account after death: <HI>Therefore, be ye al&s;o ready; for in &s;uch an hour, as ye think not, the Son of man cometh. Who then is a faithful and wi&s;e &s;ervant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his hou&s;ehold, to give them meat in due &s;ea&s;on? Ble&s;&s;ed is that &s;ervant, whom his Lord, when he cometh, &s;hall find &s;o doing. Verily I &s;ay unto you, that he &s;hall make him ruler over all his goods.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, you who are the mini&s;ters of religion, ought to be particularly careful to di&s;|charge the important tru&s;t committed to your care: you are the &s;tewards to who&s;e care the whole hou&s;ehold of the church is committed; and you would do well to remember, that your example will have a great effect upon the minds of tho&s;e employed under you. It is your duty to be well acquainted with the &s;tores of the everla&s;ting truths, and to
<PB N="203" REF="029927_0212_0FE33859BAC10400">
under&s;tand how they may be applied to the be&s;t advantage: you &s;hould al&s;o be careful to know the characters of the different per&s;ons under your direction, that you may be able to give every one of them his portion of meat in due &s;ea&s;on: and if I find you thus employed at my coming, I will reward you with the joys of my kingdom, even as an earthly ma&s;ter be&s;tows particular marks of re&s;pect on &s;uch &s;ervants as have been re|markably faithful in any important tru&s;t. But, on the other hand, if you behave like unju&s;t &s;tewards, who, becau&s;e their Lord delayeth his coming, abu&s;e their fellow &s;ervants, and riot in exce&s;s; if you tyranize over the con&s;ciences of your brethren, neglect the duties of your function, and give your&s;elves up to &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, I will come upon you unexpectedly, and make you dreadful examples of mine anger, by the &s;evere puni&s;h|ments which I will inflict upon you: 'But if that evil &s;ervant &s;hall &s;ay in his heart, My Lord delayeth his coming; and &s;hall begin to &s;mite his fellow-&s;ervant, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the lord of that &s;ervant &s;hall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and &s;hall cut him a&s;under, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth.</P>
<P>HAVING thus mentioned the rewards and puni&s;hments of a future &s;tate, it was ea&s;y and elegant for our Lord to pa&s;s from that &s;ubject to the con&s;ideration of the general judgment, when tho&s;e rewards and puni&s;hments &s;hould be de&s;tributed in their utmo&s;t extent. This could not fail of animating his di&s;ciples to a vigorous di&s;charge of their duty; and, by the &s;triking repre&s;entation of the la&s;t judgment here given, mu&s;t greatly tend to rou&s;e the con&s;ciences of men from their lethargy, and con&s;ider, before it be too late, <HI>the things which belong to their peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THEN &s;hall the kingdom of heaven,</HI> the go&s;pel-kingdom, in the la&s;t di&s;pen&s;ation of it, when the kingdom of grace is going to be &s;wallowed up in the kingdom of glory, <HI>be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And five of them were wi&s;e, and five were fooli&s;h; they that were fooli&s;h,</HI> as a proof of their &s;tupidity, took indeed their lamps, but put no oil in their ve&s;&s;els, while the wi&s;e, as an in&s;tance of their prudence and fore&s;ight, took both their lamps and oil in their ve&s;&s;els, knowing that it was uncertain when the bridegroom would arrive, and that they might, in all probability wait long for his coming. Nor were they mi&s;taken, for the bridegroom did not come &s;o &s;oon as they expected: <HI>And while he tarried they all &s;tumbered and &s;tept, and at midnight there was a cry made, Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him. Then all tho&s;e virgins aro&s;e, and trimmed their lamps. And the fooli&s;h &s;aid unto the wi&s;e, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out. But the wi&s;e an&s;wered, &s;aying, Not &s;o, le&s;t there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that &s;ell, and buy for your&s;elves. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came: and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was &s;hut. Afterward came al&s;o the other virgins, &s;aying, Lord, Lord, open unto us. But he an&s;wered, and &s;aid, Verily I &s;ay unto you, I know you not. Watch therefore; for ye know nei|ther the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</HI></P>
<P>To under&s;tand this parable aright, we mu&s;t remember that it alludes to the cu&s;toms of marriages among the ea&s;tern people. It was u&s;ual with them for the bridegroom to bring his bride home in the evening, &s;ooner or later, as circum&s;tances might happen; and, that &s;he might be received properly at his hou&s;e, his female acquaintance, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the younger &s;ort, were invited to come and wait with lamps, till &s;ome of his re|tinue, di&s;patched before the re&s;t, informed them that he was near at hand; upon which they trimmed their lamps, went forth to welcome him and conduct him with his bride into the hou&s;e, for which they were honored as gue&s;ts at the marriage fea&s;ts, and &s;hare in the fe&s;tivities.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="029927_0213_0FE3385C4AA82640">OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour compares the candidates for the kingdom of heaven, to ten &s;uch virgins; he mentions ten, becau&s;e this was the general number appointed to wait on the bridegroom; and to the&s;e, all Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors may be likened, who taking the lamp of Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, go forth to meet the bridegroom; that is, prepare them|&s;elves as candidates for the kingdom of heaven, and de&s;ire to be admitted into the happy man&s;ions of immortality, with CHRIST, the cele&s;tial Bridegroom.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e of Chri&s;tians is repre&s;ented to us by this of the virgins, half of whom only were wi&s;e, the other half being fooli&s;h. And we mu&s;t remember, that there always was, and always will be, a mixture of good and bad in the church, till the great day of &s;eparation arrives. The weakne&s;s of the fooli&s;h is repre&s;ented by their taking no oil in their ve&s;&s;els with their lamps; that is, the fooli&s;h Chri&s;tians content them&s;elves with the bare lamp of a profe&s;&s;ion, and never think of furni&s;hing it with the oil of divine grace, the fruit of which is a life of holine&s;s. Whereas, the wi&s;e, well knowing that a lamp, without the &s;upply of oil, would be &s;peedily extingui&s;hed; that faith, without love and holine&s;s, will be of no con&s;equence, take care to &s;upply them&s;elves with a &s;ufficient quan|tity of the divine grace, and to di&s;play in their lives, the works of love and charity. While all tho&s;e virgins, though differently &s;upplied, waited the coming of the bride|groom, they all &s;lumbered and &s;lept; that is, all Chri&s;tians, both good and bad, the &s;incere and the hypocrite, all lie down together in the &s;leep of death; and, while the bridegroom delayeth his coming, &s;lumber in the chambers of the du&s;t.</P>
<P>THERE is a tradition among the Jews, that CHRIST's coming to judgment will be at midnight, which agrees with that part of the parable, <HI>at midnight there was a cry made, Go ye out to meet him.</HI> But however this be, whether he will come at midnight, or in the morning, it will be awfully &s;udden and alarming; the great cry will be heard to the ends of the earth; the trumpet &s;hall &s;ound and the mighty archangel's voice pierce even to the bowels of the earth, and the depths of the ocean: <HI>Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him.</HI> All that are in the graves mu&s;t then awake, and come forth; and all will then begin to think how they may prepare them&s;elves to find admittance to the marriage-&s;upper of the Lamb: <HI>Then all tho&s;e virgins aro&s;e, and trimmed their lamps.</HI> But the fooli&s;h &s;oon perceived their folly; their lamps were gone out, totally extin|gui&s;hed, and they had no oil to &s;upport the flame: in like manner, the hypocrite's hope &s;hall peri&s;h. But the wi&s;e were in a much happier condition; they had oil in their ve&s;&s;els &s;ufficient for them&s;elves, but none to &s;pare: for, when the fooli&s;h virgins would have procured &s;ome from them, they denied their reque&s;t, fearing there would not be enough for both.</P>
<P>WE have here a repre&s;entation of nominal and &s;incere Chri&s;tians; the former having only the bare lamp of a profe&s;&s;ion, have neglected to live agreeably to the precepts and examples of their Ma&s;ter, and have not been &s;olicitous to gain the oil of divine grace, by a con&s;tant u&s;e of the means a&s;&s;igned; tho&s;e who have been contented with a mere ne|gative righteou&s;ne&s;s, with &s;uch a ju&s;tice and hone&s;ty as heathens boa&s;ted of, to who&s;e charge no henious crimes can be laid, while, at the &s;ame time, no good can be &s;poken of, as an effect of their faith; and &s;uch will fare like the fooli&s;h virgins: while the latter, who&s;e wi&s;e conduct and zealous endeavours to &s;tock their lamps with divine oil, will, like the wi&s;e virgins, enter into the joy of their Lord.</P>
<P>THOSE that were fooli&s;h, going to purcha&s;e oil, mi&s;&s;ed the bridegroom, and behold <HI>the door was &s;hut.</HI> They at la&s;t, however, reached the gate, and with great importunity cried, <HI>Lord, Lord, open unto us.</HI> But he an&s;wered, and &s;aid, <HI>Verily, I &s;ay unto you, I know
<PB N="205" REF="029927_0214_0FE3385DCF12A098">
you not.</HI> You are &s;trangers to me; you did not attend me at my coming, and now the door is &s;hut, and entrance forever denied; depart from me all ye workers of iniquity.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, how ju&s;tly did our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour bid us all <HI>watch,</HI> that we may be found ready whenever he cometh, or commands, by the king of terrors, our attendance before his judgment-&s;eat. Let us not refu&s;e this kind invitation of being con&s;tantly prepared to meet the heavenly Bridegroom: let us fill our lamps with oil, that we may be ready to follow our great Ma&s;ter into the happy man&s;ions of the heavenly Canaan.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as this duty was of the utmo&s;t importance, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, to &s;hew us more clearly the nature and u&s;e of Chri&s;tian watchfulne&s;s to which he exhorts us at the conclu&s;ion of the parable of the ten virgins, he added another, wherein he repre&s;ented the different characters of a faithful and &s;lothful &s;ervant, and the difference of their future acceptance. This parable, like the former, is intended to &s;tir us up to a zealous pre|paration for the coming of our Lord, by diligence in the di&s;charge of our duty, and by a careful improvement of our &s;ouls in holine&s;s; and at the &s;ame time, to expo&s;e the vain pretences of hypocrites, and to demon&s;trate, that fair &s;peeches, and outward form, without the power of godline&s;s, will be of no &s;ervice in the la&s;t great day of account.</P>
<P>THE Son of man, with re&s;pect to his final coming to judge the world, may be likened unto <HI>a man travelling into a far country, who called his own &s;ervants, and delivered unto them his goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his &s;everal abilities; and &s;traightway took his journey.</HI></P>
<P>HE that had received the five talents, lo&s;t no time, but went immediately on his ma&s;ter's departure, and traded with the &s;ame, and his increa&s;e was equal to his indu&s;try and application; he made them other five talents. He that had received two talents, did the &s;ame, and had equal &s;ucce&s;s. But he that received one, very unlike the conduct of his fellow-&s;ervants, went his way, digged in the earth, and hid his Lord's money, idle, u&s;ele&s;s, unemployed, and unimproved.</P>
<P>BUT after a long time, and at an hour when they did not expect it, the Lord of tho&s;e &s;ervants returned, called them before him, and ordered them to give an account of their &s;everal tru&s;ts. Upon which, he that had received five talents, as a proof of his fidelity, produced other five talents, &s;aying, <HI>Lord, thou delivered&s;t unto me five talents: be|hold, I have gained be&s;ide them, five talents more.</HI> His Lord, highly applauding his indu&s;try and fidelity, &s;aid unto him, <HI>Well done, thou good and faithful &s;ervant; thou ha&s;t been faithful over a few things, I will make the ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</HI> In like manner al&s;o, he that had received two talents, declared he had gained two others: upon which he was honoured with the &s;ame applau&s;e, and admitted into the &s;ame joy with his fellow-&s;ervant; their ma&s;ter having regard to the indu&s;try and fidelity of his &s;ervants, not to the number of the talents only, and the greatne&s;s of their increa&s;e.</P>
<P>THEN he that had received the one talent came, and with a &s;hameful fal&s;ehood, to excu&s;e his vile indolence &s;aid, 'Lord, I knew thee, that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou ha&s;t not &s;own, and gathering where thou ha&s;t not &s;trawed: and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou ha&s;t that is thine.' This di&s;|honourable notion, which the &s;ervant entertained of his Lord, greatly aggravated his crime; and accordingly his Lord was wroth, and an&s;wered, 'Thou wicked and &s;lothful &s;ervant, thou knewe&s;t that I reap where I &s;owed not, and gathere&s;t where I have not &s;trawed: thou oughte&s;t, therefore, to have put my money to the exchangers, and then
<PB N="206" REF="029927_0215_0FE3385F5321B480">
at my coming I &s;hould have received mine own with u&s;ury. Take therefore, the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath ten talents. For unto every one that hath &s;hall be given, and he &s;hall have abundance; but from him that hath not, &s;hall be taken away, even that which he hath. And ca&s;t ye the unprofitable &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vant into outer dark|ne&s;s: there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth.</P>
<P>THIS was the parable of the talents, as delivered by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour; a parable, containing the mea&s;ures of our duty to God, and the motives that enforce it, all delivered in the plaine&s;t and &s;imple&s;t allu&s;ion: but its views are &s;o exten&s;ive and affecting, that while it in&s;tructs the meane&s;t capacity, it engages reverence and attention from the greate&s;t, and &s;trikes an impre&s;&s;ion on the mo&s;t improved under&s;tanding. We are to con|&s;ider God as our Lord and Ma&s;ter, the author and giver of every good gift, and our|&s;elves as his &s;ervants or &s;tewards, who, in various in&s;tances and mea&s;ures, have received from his goodne&s;s, &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings and abilities, as may fit us for the &s;everal &s;tations and offices of life to which his providence appoints us: but then we are to ob&s;erve, that the&s;e are committed to us as a tru&s;t or loan, for who&s;e due management we are account|able to the doner. If we faithfully acquit our&s;elves of this probationary charge, we &s;hall receive far greater in&s;tances of God's confidence and favour; but if we are remi&s;s and negligent, we mu&s;t expect to feel his re&s;entment and di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A time will come, and how near it may be, none of us can tell, when our great Ma&s;ter will demand a particular account of every talent he hath committed to our care. This time may, indeed, be at a di&s;tance, for it is uncertain when the king of terrors will receive the awful warrant to terminate our exi&s;tence here below; yet it will certainly come, and our eternal happine&s;s or mi&s;ery depends upon it; &s;o that we &s;hould have it continually in our thoughts, and engrave it, as with the point of a diamond, on the tables of our hearts. But this is not all we are to learn from this in&s;tructive parable; the Divine Author has adapted every incident of the relation, to convey &s;ome &s;piritual in|&s;truction. We hence learn, that Infinite Wi&s;dom hath intru&s;ted men with different ta|lents, and adju&s;ted them to the various purpo&s;es of human life. But though the gifts of men are unequal, none can with ju&s;tice complain, &s;ince whatever is be&s;towed, be it more or le&s;s, is a favour entirely unmerited. Each then, &s;hould be thankful, and &s;atis|fied with his portion; and in&s;tead of envying the more liberal endowments of others, apply him&s;elf to the improvement of his own. And it &s;hould be attentively ob&s;erved, that the difficulty of the ta&s;k is in proportion to the number of talents committed to each. He who had received five, was to gain other five; and he who had received two, was to account for other two. Surely then, we have no rea&s;on to complain, if our Ma&s;ter has laid on us a lighter burden, a more ea&s;y and le&s;s &s;ervice than what he has on others; e&s;pecially as our intere&s;t, in the favour of the Almighty, does not depend on the number of our talents, but on application in the management of them: &s;o that the moral de&s;ign of this parable is to engage our utmo&s;t attention, to improve &s;uch talents as our heavenly Father has thought proper to be&s;tow upon us. By the&s;e talents, are principally meant, the communications and graces of the Holy Spirit, which God be&s;tows in different mea&s;ures, <HI>dividing to every man &s;everally as he will.</HI> And &s;ubordinate to the&s;e, are all the means, opportunities, and abilities to exerci&s;e or improve the&s;e graces: all the advan|tages of &s;tation, fortune, education, and whatever may enable us to do good; for we, having received all we enjoy from God, are &s;trictly obliged to promote the wi&s;e ends for which he be&s;tows his favours. And here let us take a &s;hort and imperfect view of what God has done for us: he has given us rea&s;on and under&s;tanding, to di&s;cern good from evil, and con&s;equences of things, to collect from them proper rules of judgment
<PB N="207" REF="029927_0216_0FE33868AC79D188">
and action. Indeed, &s;ince the fall, this faculty has been much ob&s;cured; but &s;till it remains an univer&s;al gift of God to men; and though not equal to all, yet it is given to every man in &s;uch mea&s;ure, as is &s;ufficient for their direction. In the knowledge of our duty, and the pur&s;uit of our happine&s;s, God has, by the go&s;pel, &s;o graciou&s;ly &s;up|plied the defects of rea&s;on, that the meane&s;t under&s;tanding may know how to be happy: &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tances of divine grace attend every Chri&s;tian, if he will apply to God for it, as may enable him to direct his inclinations, govern his pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ubdue his corrupt affections. The&s;e talents are, in &s;ome degree, common to all men; and, by the im|provements of that grace which is conferred upon every one, all have &s;ufficient to conduct them through the &s;everal &s;tages of life, if they will u&s;e but proper diligence and application.</P>
<P>BUT regard mu&s;t be had to all the means for cultivating tho&s;e gifts of nature and grace, &s;uch as all opportunities of in&s;truction, the mini&s;try, and ordinances of religion, the reproofs and examples of good men, the occa&s;ions offered, and the abilities give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the exerci&s;e of virtue: all the&s;e are talents, or gifts of God, depo&s;ited with us, to be diligently made u&s;e of, and for which we are accountable to him. I &s;hall, therefore, proceed to &s;hew what duty is required from us, in the improvement of the&s;e talents. It is here &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e talents are improveable, or otherwi&s;e they would be of no u&s;e or value; and, indeed, we are bound by the command of God, to improve them, who has threatened to inflict &s;evere penalties if we neglect it: and, if they are not im|proved, they will not continue long with us, but be lo&s;t; the fine&s;t parts and capacities, without proper culture, will make but a mean and contemptible figure. No knowledge can be pre&s;erved without u&s;e and exerci&s;e, and the &s;ame holds with regard to moral accompli&s;hments. It requires great care and attention to form a virtuous habit, and much more to pre&s;erve it in its vigour: unle&s;s we co-operate with the goodne&s;s of God's grace, and cultivate it by u&s;e and application, its impre&s;&s;ions will gradually wear out and be lo&s;t: <HI>The Spirit of God will not always &s;trive with man.</HI> He gives us a &s;tock to manage, equal to the &s;ervice he expects from us; but if we are &s;lothful and negligent, and will not apply it to the purpo&s;es for which it was given, he will recal the u&s;ele&s;s gift: <HI>Take from him,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the talent, and give it to him that hath ten talents.</HI> Let us, therefore, diligently improve every talent committed to us, becau&s;e this will be required of us in the day of account; and, if not improved, will be immediately taken from us: what this improvement implies, and how we may di&s;charge this duty, is an inquiry of the neare&s;t concern to us. The proper improvement of all God's gifts, is the em|ploying them, &s;o as may be&s;t promote his glory: this is the end the Almighty has pro|po&s;ed in our creation, in all the powers he has endowed us with, and in all the aids of grace he has vouch&s;afed to us. Whatever other improvements we make of them, they will not profit us, nor be admitted as any proof of our fidelity in the day of reckoning: we may cultivate our under&s;tanding by learning and &s;tudy, and extend our knowledge through all the &s;ubjects of human inquiry; but if our end be only to gratify our curio|&s;ity or our vanity, we are not &s;erving God, but our&s;elves; we may increa&s;e our portion of God's outward gifts, but if we only apply them to enlarge our own conveniences, we are not making the improvements our ma&s;ter expects: we may take plea&s;ure in our knowledge and fortune, rejoice in them as our portion and in&s;truments in our pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but we mu&s;t &s;till remember, that in our reckoning with God, all the&s;e im|provements of our capacities and abilities, will be added to our account: and the only u&s;e God will admit us to &s;et in balance of our debt to him, is to employ them as means of increa&s;ing and multiplying our virtues, or as in&s;truments of exerci&s;ing them in the works of religion and piety.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="029927_0217_0FE3386A43091598">FROM this parable we may learn, that the divine ju&s;tice, in this &s;crutiny, will e&s;timate and reward every one's fidelity in proportion to the improvements and returns they have made. An account will be demanded of every talent; nor will it be &s;ufficient, that we have made &s;ome improvement, it mu&s;t be proportioned to the number and value of our gifts. Let us therefore, live and act under &s;erious habitual regard to that day, when our great Ma&s;ter &s;hall come and reckon with us; remembering that &s;uch as have been idle, and made no u&s;e of the talents given them by the Almighty, will be <HI>ca&s;t into outer darkne&s;s; there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth.</HI> A pro&s;pect &s;urely &s;ufficient to awaken &s;uch from their &s;lumber, quicken them to an immediate and vigorous applica|tion to duty; that by a double improvement of the time yet remaining, they may redeem what their indolence has lo&s;t. But far wor&s;e, and more difficult to be retrieved, is his ca&s;e, who has &s;quandered away the &s;tock it&s;elf, &s;uffered his gifts to peri&s;h for want of u&s;e; or, by abu&s;ing them to the &s;ervice of &s;in, has provoked the Almighty to take them from him.</P>
<P>HOW &s;hall the prodigal recal the fortune he has &s;pent, and appea&s;e the anger of his Judge? The terrors of the Lord may ju&s;tly terrify him; but it &s;hould not extingui&s;h his endeavours in de&s;pair: he has lo&s;t many excellent talents, but he who gave can re&s;tore. Indeed, the mo&s;t circum&s;pect per&s;on will, in the great day of account, want much to be forgiven: and mu&s;t expect his reward from the mercy of his Judge, not from the merit of his &s;ervice. Let us then do all in our power to bring forth fruits, meat for re|pentance; for though the awful day of the Lord may be at a great di&s;tance, yet the time allotted us to prepare for it, is limited by the &s;hort &s;pace of human life: the night of death cometh, when no man can work: to-day, therefore, while it is called to-day, let us be diligent in the work of the Lord, correct our errors, and fini&s;h what is im|perfect, that we may obtain his approbation, and make our calling and election &s;ure, before we go hence, and are &s;een of men no more.</P>
<P>WE have endeavoured to explain the parable of the talents after this manner, and &s;hall now return to the third parable delivered at the &s;ame time by the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, namely, that of the la&s;t judgment: <HI>When the Son of man,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;hall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then &s;hall he &s;it upon the throne of his glory: and before him &s;hall be gathered all nations: and he &s;hall &s;eparate them one from another, as a &s;hepherd divideth his &s;heep from the goats: and he &s;hall &s;et the &s;heep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</HI> Matt. xxv.31, 32, 33.</P>
<P>IT is common in the Old Te&s;tament, to compare good men to &s;heep, on account of their innocence and u&s;efulne&s;s; and wicked men to goats, for their exorbitant lu&s;ts. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, however, does not pur&s;ue the allegory further, but de&s;cribes the remaining, and indeed the greate&s;t part of this awful &s;cene, in terms perfectly &s;imple; &s;o that though the &s;en&s;e be profound, it is obvious. Here the judgment of all nations, Gentiles as well as Chri&s;tians, is exhibited; and the particulars on which the&s;e awful trials are to proceed, di&s;played by the great Judge him&s;elf. Here we learn, that we &s;hall be condemned or acquitted, accordingly as we have neglected or performed works of charity; works which flow from the great principles of faith and piety, and which the very Heathens are, by the light of nature, invited to perform. But we mu&s;t not under|&s;tand, that &s;uch works merited this favour from the Judge; not all who are acquitted at that day, &s;hall be acquitted &s;olely on account of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, the true, the only meritorious cau&s;e, as well Heathens as Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>WHO can read the following &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon the righteous, without feeling the warme&s;t love and gratitude to the great Author of all good; and what a noble motive
<PB N="209" REF="029927_0218_0FE3386BC7F6B240">
to per&s;everance in well-doing does it afford: <HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed children of my Father, in|herit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</HI> Good men, can at be&s;t, but con&s;ider their pre&s;ent &s;tate as a bani&s;hment from their native country. A &s;tate in which they are often expo&s;ed to innumerable temptations, to per&s;ecutions, to pover|ty, to reproach, to contempt. But the con&s;ideration that they are travelling towards the heavenly Jeru&s;alem, a city prepared for them, when the foundations of the world were laid, will be abundantly &s;ufficient to &s;upport their &s;pirits, and render them <HI>more than conquerors.</HI> The glory laid up for them in the man&s;ions of eternity, and which the great Judge will, at the awful day of account, confer upon them, will animate them to bear the violence of their oppre&s;&s;ors, and even defy the malice of men and devils. Nay, they will behold with contempt the flouri&s;hing pro&s;perity of the wicked, and look forward to that glorious and immortal crown which will be given them by their great Redeemer. Then &s;hall the King &s;ay unto them on the right hand, <HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed chil|dren of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink: I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was &s;ick, and ye vi&s;ited me: I was in pri&s;on, and ye came unto me.</HI> Matt xxv.34, 35, 36.</P>
<P>BEING a&s;toni&s;hed to hear the great Judge declare, that all the good offices they have ever done to their brethren in affliction, was done to him, they a&s;k with great reverence and humility, when they performed the&s;e &s;ervices? as they never &s;aw him in want, and therefore could never a&s;&s;i&s;t him: <HI>Lord, when &s;aw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thir&s;ty, and gave thee drink? When &s;aw we thee a &s;tranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when &s;aw we thee &s;ick, or in pri&s;on, and came unto thee? And the king &s;hall an&s;wer and &s;ay unto them, Verily I &s;ay unto you, ina&s;much as ye have done it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</HI> This is truly a&s;toni&s;hing! The uni|ted wi&s;dom of men and angels could never have di&s;covered a more proper method to convey an idea of the warmth and force of the divine benevolence to the &s;ons of men, or offer a more forcible motive to charity, than that the Son of God him&s;elf, &s;hould from his &s;eat of judgment, in the pre&s;ence of the whole race of mankind, and all the ho&s;ts of ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits from the courts of heaven, declare that all good offices done to the afflicted, are done to him&s;elf. During the time of his dwelling with human nature in this vale of tears, he &s;uffered un&s;peakable injuries and afflictions; and therefore he con&s;iders all the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed virtuous, as members of his body, loves them with the ut|mo&s;t tenderne&s;s, and is &s;o greatly intere&s;ted in their welfare, that he grieves when they are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and rejoices when they are happy.</P>
<P>PERHAPS in this repre&s;entation of the la&s;t judgment, it may &s;eem &s;trange that the inquiry &s;hould &s;olely turn on the performance of duties, without any regard to the com|mi&s;&s;ion of crimes. Perhaps the true rea&s;on is, that men, generally &s;peaking, con&s;ider the neglect of duties as a matter of no great con&s;equence, but dread the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes. And hence it happens, that while they keep them&s;elves free from the latter, they ea&s;ily find excu&s;es for the former. And as there is not a more pernicious error with regard to religion and morality than this, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS thought pro|per to give &s;uch an account of the judgment, as &s;hould prove the mo&s;t &s;olemn caution again&s;t it. But as the inquiry turns wholly on the performance of duties, it has been a&s;ked why the offices of charity only are mentioned, and no notice taken of the duties of piety, though the Judge him&s;elf, upon another occa&s;ion, declared the&s;e to be of more importance than the duties of charity, &s;o highly applauded in this parable? But tho&s;e who a&s;k this que&s;tion would do well to remember, that charity cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;eparate|ly: piety and its origin, faith, always producing charity; and charity, wherever it &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts, nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;uppo&s;ing piety.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="029927_0219_0FE3386D4D7B10A8">THERE is &s;uch a connection between piety and charity, as it will evidently appear, if it be rightly con&s;idered, that no man can be truly benevolent and merciful, without loving tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions: con&s;equently, he mu&s;t love benevolence in God, that is, he mu&s;t love God; for piety, or the love of God, is nothing el&s;e but the regard we cheri&s;h towards God, on account of his perfections. Piety and charity being thus e&s;&s;entially connected together, it was abundantly &s;ufficient to examine the conduct of men with regard to either of tho&s;e graces. In the parable, the inquiry is repre&s;ented as turning upon the duties of charity, perhaps, becau&s;e in this branch of goodne&s;s, there is le&s;s room for &s;elf-deceit than in the other. It is common for hypocrites, by a pretended zeal in the externals of religion to make &s;pecious pretences to extraordinary piety, and at the &s;ame time are totally deficient in charity; are covetous, unju&s;t, rapa|cious, and proud, and, con&s;equently, de&s;titute of all love for their Creator. But none can a&s;&s;ume the appearance of charity, but by feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and performing other benevolent offices to their brethren. The works of charity may indeed, in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, flow from other principles than tho&s;e of a pious and benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, as from vanity, or even views of intere&s;t; but then it &s;hould be remembered, that a common degree of hypocri&s;y will hardly en|gage men to undertake them: they are by far too weighty duties to be &s;u&s;tained by tho&s;e fal&s;e principles, and therefore are &s;eldom counterfeited. Con&s;equently, we may conclude, that the love of God, reigns in perfection wherever a genuine, exten&s;ive, and permanent charity is found.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, this parable teaches us in the plaine&s;t manner, that however loud pre|tentions we may make to piety, they will &s;tand us in no &s;tead at the awful tribunal of the Son of God, if we are deficient in works of charity. At the &s;ame time, if we con|&s;ider it in its true light, it will give us no rea&s;on to hope well of our&s;elves, if we are wanting in our duty to God; and will &s;hew us, that we &s;hould not only be charitable, but grateful; al&s;o, ju&s;t, temperate, and blamele&s;s in all our dealings with mankind, for we &s;hould remember, that the duty we owe to the Almighty is no other than what is due from all men in all circum&s;tances, and which it would be unju&s;t in us to neg|lect. It con&s;i&s;ts in di&s;po&s;itions and actions, the &s;ame in kind, but different in degree, proportionate to the perfection of the object. He who loves and admires holine&s;s, ju&s;|tice, and truth in men, cannot but love the&s;e perfections in God, that is, he mu&s;t love God: &s;o likewi&s;e, he that is truly greatful to an earthly benefactor, cannot be ungrate|ful to one from who&s;e bounty he receives all the good things he enjoys: and &s;ince in|gratitude in men is nothing more than forgetting the benefit received, and the benefac|tor who conferred the favour; how can we acquit our&s;elves from the charge of ingra|titude to God, if we forget the obligations we lie under to him, and are at no pains to return him thanks; that is, if we wholly neglect the eternal and internal exerci&s;es of devotion. Since therefore, the duty we owe to God is the fame in kind with that we owe to man, it will undeniably follow, that true morality can never exi&s;t where piety is wanting; and that a per&s;on renders him&s;elf ridiculous, who pretends to morality and is di&s;titute of piety.</P>
<P>THUS having endeavoured to &s;hew that ju&s;tice and piety cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;eparately from each other, I &s;hall now return to the remaining part of the parable, which exhibits a &s;cene, enough to terrify the mo&s;t hardened &s;inner. The awful judge him&s;elf has told us, that after he has pa&s;&s;ed the happy &s;entence on the righteous, he will pronounce the following &s;entence of condemnation upon the wicked: <HI>Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thir&s;ty, and ye game me no drink: I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me not in:
<PB N="211" REF="029927_0220_0FE33875ED013998">
naked, and ye clothed me not: &s;ick and in pri&s;on, and ye vi&s;ited me not. Then &s;hall they al&s;o an&s;wer him, &s;aying, Lord, when &s;aw we thee an hungered, or athir&s;t, or a &s;tranger, or naked, or &s;ick, or in pri&s;on, and did not mini&s;ter unto thee? Then &s;hall he an&s;wer them, &s;aying, Verily I &s;ay unto you, ina&s;much as ye did it not to one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e, ye did it not to me.</HI> Matt. xxv.41&mdash;46.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour has told us, that the fire of hell was prepared for the Devil and his angels, as well as for the wicked; and that the kingdom of heaven was prepared for the righteous. Perhaps he intended to teach us, that the original de&s;ign of omnipotence was to render man happy; not mi&s;erable: a &s;tate of con&s;ummate felicity was formed for the human race, at the time they were created: but the fire of hell was prepared for the Devil and his angels immediately after their fall. And as wicked men join with devils in their &s;in of rebellion again&s;t the Almighty, they are doomed to &s;hare with them in their puni&s;hments; a puni&s;hment of the heavie&s;t kind, a puni&s;hment of devils.</P>
<P>OUR Saviour having repre&s;ented the &s;entences that are to be pa&s;&s;ed on the righteous and the wicked, he clo&s;ed the parable in the following manner: <HI>And the&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment: but the righteous into life eternal.</HI> An expre&s;&s;ion &s;hort indeed, but awful beyond expre&s;&s;ion! And were it fully under&s;tood, it mu&s;t &s;urely make an im|pre&s;&s;ion on the mo&s;t hardened &s;inner; as it indicates, that, when the &s;entence is pa&s;&s;ed, the &s;cene is clo&s;ed forever, and everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, or life eternal, mu&s;t be the lot of every individual of the human race.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CHRIST</HI> again foretelleth his own Death: The Rulers con&s;pire again&s;t him: A Woman poureth precious Ointment upon his Head: Judas covenanteth with the Council to betray his Ma&s;ter for thirty Pieces of Silver: Peter and John &s;ent to prepare the Pa&s;&s;over: <HI>CHRIST</HI> eateth it with them, and wa&s;heth his Di&s;ciples' Feet: He comforteth them with the Promi&s;e of a heavenly Man&s;ion: He profe&s;&s;eth him&s;elf the Way, the Truth, and the Life: He foretelleth the Treachery of Judas, and pointeth him out to John by a Token.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had fini&s;hed the before-mentioned parables, he added a &s;hort account of his own death, in order to fortify the di&s;ciples again&s;t the greate&s;t trial they had yet met with; namely, the &s;ufferings of their Ma&s;ter; <HI>And it came to pa&s;s, when Je&s;us had fini&s;hed all the&s;e &s;ayings, he &s;aid unto his di&s;ciples, Ye know that after two days is the fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. Then a&s;&s;embled to|gether the chief prie&s;ts, and the &s;cribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high prie&s;t, who was called Caiaphas, and con&s;ulted that they might take Je&s;us by &s;ubtilty, and kill him. But they &s;aid, Not on the fea&s;t-day, le&s;t there be an uproar among the people.</HI> Matt. xxvi.1&mdash;5.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, with his di&s;ciples, repaired to Bethany in the evening, and entered the hou&s;e of Simon the leper, probably one who had experienced the healing efficacy of his power. But while he &s;at at meat, a woman who had al&s;o doubtle&s;s been an object of his mercy, poured a box of precious ointment upon his head. This action di&s;plea&s;ed the di&s;ciples, who knew their Ma&s;ter was not delighted with luxuries of any kind; and therefore they rebuked the woman, imagining it would have been more acceptable to the Son of God, if the ointment had been &s;old, and the money di&s;tributed
<PB N="212" REF="029927_0221_0FE33879818CE190">
among&s;t the &s;ons and daughters of poverty and affliction. But their benevolent Ma&s;ter &s;aid, that it had plea&s;ed the Divine Providence to order, that there &s;hould always be per&s;ons in nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances, that the virtuous might never want occa&s;ions for exerci&s;ing their charity; but tho&s;e who did not now te&s;tify their love to him, would never more have an opportunity of doing it, as the time of his mini&s;try was near its period, when the king of terrors &s;hould enjoy a &s;hort triumph over his body; and therefore this woman had &s;ea&s;onably anointed him for his burial. And to make them &s;en&s;ible of their folly, in blaming the woman for this her token of love to him, he a&s;&s;ured them, that her me|mory &s;hould live to the late&s;t period of time, and that &s;he &s;hould be highly celebrated for this action in every part of the world.</P>
<P>BUT Judas I&s;cariot, one of the twelve, having been more forward than the re&s;t, in condemning the woman, thought the rebuke was peculiarly directed to him. Stung with the guilt of his own con&s;cience, he ro&s;e from table, went immediately into the city, to the high-prie&s;t's palace, where he found the whole council a&s;&s;embled. His pa&s;&s;ion would not &s;uffer him to reflect on the horrid deed he was going to commit: he imme|diately promi&s;ed to betray into their hands, his Lord and Ma&s;ter, for the paltry reward of thirty pieces of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>THUS having engaged with the rulers of I&s;rael, to put into their hands, a per&s;on who had been long labouring for their &s;alvation, and had often invited them in the mo&s;t pathetic manner, to embrace the benevolent terms of the go&s;pel offered by the Al|mighty, he &s;ought an opportunity to betray him in the ab&s;ence of the multitude. Ye mon&s;ters in the human form, how could you plot &s;o dete&s;table a crime? Surely you have forgot how mercy, with her charming voice, &s;pake in all he uttered! How did benevo|lence pour her choice&s;t &s;tores in all his actions! Ye rulers of I&s;rael, did ever compa&s;&s;ion look &s;o amiably &s;oft, as in tho&s;e melting tears which &s;welled his eyes, and poured down his cheeks, to &s;often your hard and &s;tony hearts? Was it po&s;&s;ible for patience to a&s;&s;ume a form &s;o lovely, as that &s;weetly winning conduct, that endured the contradic|tion of &s;inners; which be&s;ought the guilty not to die, and entreated the ob&s;tinate to be reconciled.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tate Judus was thus bargaining with the chief prie&s;ts and elders to betray his Ma&s;ter, while the benevolent JESUS was preparing to celebrate the pa&s;&s;over before he &s;uffered, with his di&s;ciples. He was now going to fini&s;h the mighty work for which he came into the world; and therefore, would not neglect to fulfil the &s;malle&s;t part of the law of Mo&s;es. He therefore, &s;ent two of his di&s;ciples into the city, to prepare a lamp, and make it ready for eating the pa&s;&s;over; telling them that they &s;hould meet a man, bearing a pitcher of water, who would conduct them to his hou&s;e, and &s;hew them a large upper room furni&s;hed, where they were to make ready for him. He was wil|ling, in this la&s;t tran&s;action, to convince his di&s;ciples, that he knew every thing which &s;hould befal him, that his &s;ufferings were all premeditated by the Almighty; and that they were all &s;ubmitted unto voluntarily on his own account.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as night approached, JESUS left Bethany; and every thing being ready for him, at the time he entered into the city, he &s;at down at the appointed hour. But knowing that his &s;ufferings was now near, he told his di&s;ciples in the mo&s;t affectionate manner, that he had greatly longed to eat the pa&s;&s;over with them before he &s;uffered, in order to &s;hew them the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of his love. The&s;e proofs were to give them a pattern of humility and charity, by wa&s;hing their feet: in&s;tructing them in the nature of his death, as a propitiatory &s;acrifice; in&s;tituting the &s;acrament in commemoration of
<PB N="213" REF="029927_0222_0FE3387B076BCF90">
his &s;ufferings; comforting them by the tender di&s;cour&s;es recorded in John xiv, xv, xvi. in which he gave them a variety of excellent directions, together with many gra|cious promi&s;es, and recommending them to the kind protection of his heavenly Fa|ther: <HI>With de&s;ire I have de&s;ired to eat this pa&s;&s;over with you before I &s;uffer; for I &s;ay unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</HI> Luke xxii.15, 16.</P>
<P>AFTER our Lord had thus &s;poken, he aro&s;e from the table, laid a&s;ide his garments like a &s;ervant, and, with all the circum&s;tances of an humble mini&s;ter, wa&s;hed the feet of his di&s;ciples without di&s;tinction, though one of them, Judas I&s;cariot, was a mon&s;ter of im|piety, that they might at once behold a conjunction of charity and humility, of &s;elf-denial and indifference, repre&s;ented by a per&s;on glorious beyond expre&s;&s;ion, in their great Lord and Ma&s;ter. He cho&s;e to wa&s;h their feet rather than their head, that he might have an opportunity of di&s;playing a more humble po&s;ture, and a more &s;triking in&s;tance of his charity. The omnipotent Son of the Father lays every thing a&s;ide, that he may &s;erve his followers; heaven &s;toops to earth; one aby&s;s calls upon another; and the mi&s;eries of man, which were almo&s;t infinite, are exceeded by a mercy equal to the immen&s;ity of the Almighty. He deferred this ceremony, which was a cu&s;tomary civility paid to ho|nourable &s;trangers, at the beginning of their fea&s;ts, that it might be preparatory to the &s;econd, which he intended &s;hould be a fea&s;t to the whole world, when all the followers of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS &s;hould have an opportunity of feeding on his fle&s;h, and drinking his blood in a &s;piritual manner.</P>
<P>PETER mode&s;tly declined it when our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour came unto him; but his Ma&s;ter told him, that if he refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit implicitly to all his orders, he could have no part with him. On which Peter cried out, <HI>Lord, not my feet only, but al&s;o my hands and my head.</HI> But JESUS told him, that the per&s;on who had bathed him&s;elf, had no rea&s;on to wa&s;h any part of his body except his feet, which he might have dirtied by walking from the bath. In order to teach us, that per&s;ons converted do not &s;tand in need of a total change of mind, but only to clean&s;e them&s;elves from the particular &s;ins they con&s;tantly commit through infirmity; for it is abundantly evident that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;pake of a &s;piritual wa&s;hing, becau&s;e he added, <HI>ye are clean, but not all.</HI> Ye are men of virtuous and holy di&s;po&s;itions; but not all: I well know that one of you will betray me.</P>
<P>AFTER our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had fini&s;hed this menial &s;ervice, he a&s;ked his di&s;ciples if they knew the meaning of what he had done, as the action was purely emblematical? You truly, added he, &s;tyle me Ma&s;ter and Lord, for I am the Son of God, and the Sa|viour of the world: but if I, your Ma&s;ter and your Lord, have conde&s;cended to wa&s;h your feet, you &s;urely ought to perform, with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure, the humble&s;t offices of charity to one another. I have &s;et you a pattern of humility, and I recommend it to you.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY nothing can more effectually &s;hew us the nece&s;&s;ity of this heavenly tem|per of mind, than its being recommended to us by &s;o great an example: a recommenda|tion, which, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, was particularly &s;ea&s;onable; for the di&s;ciples having heard their great Ma&s;ter declare, that the kingdom of heaven was at hand, their minds were filled with ambitious thoughts. Upon which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour added, 'Ye need not be a&s;hamed to follow my example in this particular; for no &s;ervant can thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k it beneath him, to conde&s;cend to perform tho&s;e actions his Lord has done before him: and, therefore, if he knows his duty, he will be happy if he practi&s;es it.' Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour added, that though he had called them to the apo&s;tle&s;hip, and well knew the &s;ecret di&s;po&s;itions of every heart, before he cho&s;e them, they need not be &s;urpri&s;ed

that any one among them &s;hould prove a traitor, as it was done, that the &s;cripture might be fulfilled: <HI>He that eateth bread with me, hath lifted up his heel again&s;t me.</HI> John xiii.18.</P>
<P>OUR dear Lord being now to be but a &s;hort time with his di&s;ciples, he thought proper to take his farewell of them, which he did in the mo&s;t affectionate manner. The&s;e melan|choly tidings greatly troubled them. They were very unwilling to part with &s;o kind a friend, &s;o dear a ma&s;ter, &s;o wi&s;e a guide, and &s;o profitable a teacher; e&s;pecially as they thought they &s;hould be left in a forlorn condition, a poor and helple&s;s prey to the rage and hatred of a blind and malicious generation. They &s;eemed willing to die with their Lord, if that might be accepted: <HI>Why cannot I follow thee? I will lay down my life for thy &s;ake,</HI> was the language of one, and even all of them: but the thoughts of a di&s;con&s;olate &s;eparation they could not &s;upport.</P>
<P>THEIR dear Lord and Ma&s;ter &s;eeing them thus dejected, endeavoured to cheer their drooping &s;pirits: <HI>Let not your hearts be troubled.</HI> Li&s;ten attentively to what I am going to deliver for your con&s;olation: <HI>I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto my&s;elf; that where I am, there you may be al&s;o.</HI> A reviving admonition! They were one day to meet again their dear, their affectionate Ma&s;ter, in a place where they &s;hould live together to all eternity. But death makes &s;o va&s;t a di&s;tance between friends, and the di&s;ciples then knew &s;o little of a future &s;tate, that they &s;eemed to doubt whether they &s;hould ever after parting, meet their great Redeemer. They neither knew the place where he was going, nor the way that led to his kingdom. <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>we know not whither thou goe&s;t, and how can we know the way?</HI> In an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, he told them, that he was <HI>the way, the truth, and the life;</HI> as if he had &s;aid, the only way of following me to the regions of happine&s;s, is by duly ob|&s;erving my doctrines and precepts which I have delivered to you from the Almighty. He added, that by his removing to heaven, he would there intercede for them with his heavenly Father, and &s;end the Holy Gho&s;t to comfort them from thence.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, le&s;t all the&s;e arguments &s;hould not be &s;ufficient to quiet their minds, he had &s;till another, which could not fail of &s;ucce&s;s: <HI>If ye loved me,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>ye would rejoice, becau&s;e I &s;aid, I go unto the father:</HI> intimating that he would con&s;ider it as a proof of their love to him, if they cea&s;ed to mourn. They doubtle&s;s thought, that by grieving for his death, they expre&s;&s;ed their love for their Ma&s;ter; and it &s;hould &s;eem &s;trange, that our Saviour &s;hould put &s;o contrary an interpretation on their friendly &s;orrow, or require &s;o unnatural a thing of them, as to rejoice at his departure. What! (might they think) &s;hall we rejoice at &s;o amiable a friend's removal from us; or can we be glad that he retires and leaves us in this vale of mi&s;ery? No, it is impo&s;&s;ible? the human heart, on &s;o melancholy an occa&s;ion, has no di&s;po&s;ition to rejoice. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, therefore, adds this rea&s;on to &s;olve the &s;eeming paradox, becau&s;e he was going to the Father; that is, he was going to a&s;cend to the right hand of infinite power, from whence he would &s;end them all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they could de&s;ire. It mu&s;t not, however, be &s;up|po&s;ed, that our Saviour meant by the&s;e words, that his di&s;ciples &s;hould not be concerned at his death, or that they could not love him unle&s;s they expre&s;&s;ed a vi&s;ible joy on this occa&s;ion: that would, indeed, have been a hard interpretation of their grief; he well knew their grief flowed from love, and that if their love had not been &s;trong, their &s;orrow had been much le&s;s. Indeed, their Ma&s;ter was fully convinced, that love was the occa&s;ion of their &s;orrow; and, for that rea&s;on, he u&s;ed the&s;e arguments to mitigate it.</P>
<P>OUR Lord did not intend to intimate, that all &s;orrow for &s;o worthy a friend, was un|lawful, or an unbecoming expre&s;&s;ion of their love; doubtle&s;s, he was not di&s;plea&s;ed to
<PB N="215" REF="029927_0224_0FE33883E9756B28">
&s;ee his di&s;ciples &s;o tenderly affected at his removal from them: he who &s;hed tears at the grave of Lazarus, blended with &s;ighs and groans, cannot be thought to forbid them wholly at his own; he, therefore, did not chide his di&s;ciples with angry reproaches, as though they had been entirely in the wrong, but gently rea&s;oned with them by kind per&s;ua&s;ion, <HI>Let not your heart be troubled,</HI> as rather pitying than condemning their &s;orrow. Soon after JESUS had &s;poken the&s;e things, his heart was greatly troubled, to think that one of his di&s;ciples &s;hould prove his enemy: he complained of it at the table, declaring that one of them &s;hould betray him. This moving declaration greatly affected the di&s;|ciples, and they began every one of them to &s;ay to their Ma&s;ter, <HI>Lord, is it I?</HI> But JESUS giving them no deci&s;ive an&s;wer, John, the beloved di&s;ciple, who&s;e &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition and other amiable qualities, is perpetuated in the peculiar love his great Ma&s;ter bore him, and was now reclining on his bo&s;om, a&s;ked him, who among the di&s;ciples could be guilty of &s;o dete&s;table a crime? JESUS told him, that the per&s;on to whom he &s;hould give the &s;op, when he had dipped it, was he who &s;hould betray him: accordingly, as &s;oon as he had dipped the &s;op in the di&s;h, he gave it to Judas I&s;cariot, &s;aying to him at the &s;ame time, <HI>That thou doe&s;t, do quickly.</HI></P>
<P>JUDAS received the &s;op, without knowing any thing of what his Ma&s;ter had told the beloved di&s;ciple, nor did any of the di&s;ciples, except St. John, entertain the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pi|cion, that Judas was the per&s;on who would betray their Ma&s;ter. They were, indeed, &s;o deeply affected with his declaration, that one of them &s;hould betray him, that they did not remark the words of JESUS to his apo&s;tate di&s;ciple; but continued to a&s;k him, who was the per&s;on that &s;hould be guilty of &s;o unnatural a crime? Willing at la&s;t, to &s;atisfy their importunity, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS declared, that the per&s;on who dipped his hand with him in the di&s;h, &s;hould betray him. This, to the eleven, was a joyful declaration, but confounding in the highe&s;t degree, to Judas: impudent as he was, it &s;truck him &s;peechle&s;s, di&s;playing the &s;oulne&s;s of his heart, and pointing him out plainly.</P>
<P>JUDAS continued mute with confu&s;ion, while the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS declared, that his death &s;hould be brought about according to the decrees of heaven, though that would not in the lea&s;t mitigate the crime of the per&s;on who betrayed him; adding, <HI>it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</HI> Judas having now recovered him&s;elf a little, a&s;&s;erted his innocence, by a que&s;tion which implied a negation of the charge. But his Ma&s;ter po&s;itively affirming that he was the per&s;on, he was &s;oon &s;ilenced.</P>
<P>JUDAS I&s;cariot's treachery in betraying his Ma&s;ter, mu&s;t rai&s;e the a&s;toni&s;hment of every reader, who has any notion of the character of our great, our merciful Redeemer. It will not therefore, we hope, be di&s;agreeable to the reader, to explain the motives that induced him to be guilty of this atrocious crime, and con&s;ider particularly the cir|cum&s;tances that attended &s;o inhuman an action. Some are of opinion, that he was induced to commit this villainy by the re&s;entment of the rebuke given him by his Ma&s;ter, for blaming the woman who came with the precious ointment, and anointed the head of JESUS, as he &s;at at meat in the hou&s;e of Simon the leper&mdash;but though this had doubt|le&s;s its weight with the traitor: yet it could not, I think, be the only motive, becau&s;e the rebuke was given in general, to all the di&s;ciples, who had, perhaps, been equally forward with him, in cen&s;uring the woman; nor can we imagine, even if he had been rebuked alone, that &s;o mild a reproof could provoke any per&s;on, however wicked, to the horrid act of murdering his friend, much le&s;s Judas, who&s;e covetous di&s;po&s;ition, mu&s;t have di&s;po&s;ed him to bear every thing from his Ma&s;ter, from whom he expected the highe&s;t preferment when he openly declared him&s;elf the Me&s;&s;iah, and took the reins of government into his own hands. If it &s;hould be an&s;wered, that his re&s;entment was &s;o
<PB N="216" REF="029927_0225_0FE33887D8FF3B20">
great as to hinder him from exerci&s;ing his rea&s;on, I de&s;ire it may be remembered, that though he actually agreed with the chief prie&s;ts, a few hours after the rebuke was given, yet he did not commit the henious crime till two days after: be&s;ides, to impute his treachery to the &s;udden impul&s;es of a &s;trong re&s;entment, is &s;o great an alleviation of his crime, as &s;eems ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with the character given of it in the &s;cripture, where it is &s;aid to merit the heavie&s;t puni&s;hment, and repre&s;ented in the blacke&s;t colours.</P>
<P>THERE are others that think Judas betrayed his Ma&s;ter through covetou&s;ne&s;s: but if we under&s;tand by covetou&s;ne&s;s, the reward given by the prie&s;ts, this opinion is equally defective; for the &s;um was too &s;mall for the mo&s;t covetous wretch to think equivalent to the life of a friend, e&s;pecially when he expected from him the highe&s;t po&s;ts and advantages. The reader will be convinced of the force of this remark, when he re|members, that all the di&s;ciples believed the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom was in&s;tantly to be erected; and that according to the notion they entertained of it, each of them, e&s;pecially the apo&s;tles, expected, in a very &s;hort time, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e riches; be&s;ides the &s;cripture tells us, that the predominate pa&s;&s;ion of Judas was covetou&s;ne&s;s; he there|fore, could not be &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, as when ju&s;t on the point of receiving an immen&s;e reward for his &s;ervice, to exchange every thing for &s;o trifling a &s;um.</P>
<P>BUT there are others that attribute the perfidy of Judas, to his doubting whether his Ma&s;ter was the Me&s;&s;iah, and that he betrayed him in a fit of de&s;pair: but of all the &s;olu|tions, this is the wor&s;t founded; for, if Judas believed his Ma&s;ter to be an impo&s;tor, he mu&s;t have ob&s;erved &s;omething in his behaviour, which led him to form &s;uch an opinion of him, and, in that ca&s;e, he would doubtle&s;s, have mentioned it to the chief prie&s;ts and elders, when he made the contract with them, which it is plain he did not, as they would have reminded him of it, when he came back and expre&s;&s;ed his remor&s;e for what he had done. It &s;hould al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that had Judas given them any intimations of this kind, they would doubtle&s;s have urged them again&s;t our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf, in the cour&s;e of his trial, when they were at &s;o great a lo&s;s for witne&s;&s;es to &s;upport their accu&s;ations; and again&s;t the apo&s;tles afterwards, when they reproved them for &s;peaking in the name of JESUS: be&s;ides, had Judas thought his Ma&s;ter an impo&s;tor, and propo&s;ed nothing by his treachery, but the price he put upon his life, how came he to &s;ell him for &s;uch a trifle, when he well knew, that the chief prie&s;ts and rulers would have given him any &s;um, rather than not have gotten him into their hands? In fine, the &s;uppo&s;ition that Judas believed his Ma&s;ter to be an impo&s;tor, is directly confuted by the &s;olemn declaration he made to the prie&s;ts, when he declared the deepe&s;t conviction of the innocence of our great Redeemer: <HI>I have &s;inned,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>in betraying the innocent blood.</HI> And it mu&s;t be remembered, that the remor&s;e he felt for his crime, was too bitter to be endured; &s;o that he fled even to the king of terrors for relief, after he &s;aw his Ma&s;ter condemned.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, &s;ince the treachery of Judas did not proceed from any of the&s;e motives, it may be a&s;ked, what other motive can be a&s;&s;igned for his conduct? The evangeli&s;t St. John tells us, that he was of &s;o covetous a di&s;po&s;ition, as to &s;teal money out of our Lord's bag; and hence we have &s;ufficient rea&s;on to believe, that he fir&s;t followed JESUS, with a view of obtaining riches, and other temporal advantages, which he expected the Me&s;&s;iah's friends would enjoy: it likewi&s;e authori&s;es us to think, that as he had hitherto reaped none of the&s;e advantages, he might grow impatient under the delay, and the rather, as JESUS had lately di&s;couraged all ambitious views among&s;t his di&s;ciples, and neglected to embrace the opportunity of erecting his kingdom, which was offered him by the multitude who accompanied him into Jeru&s;alem with &s;houts, and crying, <HI>Ho&s;anna
<PB N="217" REF="029927_0226_0FE338895CB9BE98">
to the Son of David,</HI> His impatience, therefore becoming exce&s;&s;ive, in&s;pired him with the thought of delivering his Ma&s;ter into the hands of the council, firmly per&s;uaded, that he would then be obliged to a&s;&s;ume the dignity of the Me&s;&s;iah, and con&s;equently able to reward his followers: for, as this court was compo&s;ed of the chief prie&s;ts, elders and &s;cribes, that is, the principal per&s;ons of the &s;acredotal order, the repre&s;entatives of the great families, and the doctors of the law; the traitor did not doubt that his Ma&s;ter, when brought before &s;o augu&s;t an a&s;&s;embly, would a&s;&s;ert his preten&s;ions to the title of the Me&s;&s;iah, prove his claim to their full conviction, gain them over to his intere&s;t, and immediately enter on his regal dignity. And though he mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that the mea|&s;ures he took to compa&s;s this intention, were very offen&s;ive to his Ma&s;ter; yet he might think the &s;ucce&s;s of it would procure his pardon from &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate a Ma&s;ter, and even recommend him to favour. In the mean time, his project, however plau&s;ible it might appear to one of his turn, was far from being free from difficulty; and therefore, while he revolved it in his own mind, many things might occur to &s;tagger his re&s;olution. At length, thinking him&s;elf affronted by the rebuke of JESUS, at the time when the woman anointed the head of his Ma&s;ter, he was provoked to execute the re&s;olution he had formed of obliging him to alter his mea&s;ures. Ri&s;ing, therefore, directly from the table, he went immediately into the city, to the palace of the high prie&s;t, where he found the council a&s;&s;embled, con&s;ulting how they might take JESUS by &s;ubtilty, in the ab&s;ence of the multitude. To them he made known his intention of delivering his Ma&s;ter into their hands; and undertook, for a &s;mall &s;um of money, to conduct a band of armed men to the place where the Saviour of the world u&s;ually &s;pent the night with his di&s;ciples, where they might apprehend him without the lea&s;t danger of tumult. Thus the great deceiver of mankind tempted him to commit the horrid action, by laying hold of the various pa&s;&s;ions that now agitated the traitor's brea&s;t.</P>
<P>IT may be gathered from the nature of the contract, that the&s;e were really the mo|tives which induced Judas to betray his Ma&s;ter: <HI>What will ye give me,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and I will deliver him unto you?</HI> He did not mean that he would deliver him up to be put to death; for though the prie&s;ts had con&s;ulted among them&s;elves, how they might de&s;troy JESUS, they had not been &s;o abominably wicked as to declare their intention publicly: they only propo&s;ed to bring him to trial for a&s;&s;uming the character of the Me&s;&s;iah, and to treat him as it &s;hould appear he de&s;erved. The offer, therefore, which Judas made them of delivering him up, was in conformity to their public re&s;olutions; nor did they under&s;tand it in any other light: for, had the prie&s;ts thought that his de&s;ign in this was to get his Ma&s;ter puni&s;hed with death, they mu&s;t al&s;o have thought he believed him to be an impo&s;tor; in which ca&s;e, they would doubtle&s;s have produced him as one of their principal evidences, no per&s;on being more proper to bear witne&s;s again&s;t any criminal than his companion. Or, &s;uppo&s;ing Judas repented before the trial came on, and had withdrawn him&s;elf, the prie&s;ts might have argued with great plau&s;ibility, both in their own court, and before the governor, that for a man's di&s;ciple to require the judges to bring him to condign puni&s;hment, branded him with &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion of guilt, as was almo&s;t equal to a full proof: al&s;o, when Judas returned to them with the money, declaring that he had &s;inned in betraying the innocent blood, in&s;tead of replying, <HI>What is that to us, &s;ee thou to that?</HI> it was the mo&s;t natural thing in the world to have upbraided him with the &s;tain he had put upon his Ma&s;ter's cha|racter, by the contract they had made with him. It is true, they called the money they gave him, <HI>the price of blood;</HI> but they did not mean this in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, as they had neither hired Judas to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his Ma&s;ter, nor can they be &s;uppo&s;ed to have charged them&s;elves with the guilt of murdering him: it was only the price of blood in
<PB N="218" REF="029927_0227_0FE3388AE43D1598">
con&s;equence of its being the reward they had given to the traitor for putting it in their power to take away the life of CHRIST, under the colour and form of public ju&s;tice; nay, it may be even doubted, whether Judas a&s;ked the money, as a reward or his &s;er|vice: he covetou&s;ly, indeed, kept it, and the prie&s;ts, for that rea&s;on, called it the price of blood.</P>
<P>JUDAS, in &s;hort, knew that the rulers could not take away the life of any per&s;on what|&s;oever, the Romans having deprived them of that power; and, therefore, could have no de&s;ign of this kind in delivering him up; not to mention that it was a common opinion among the Jews, that the Me&s;&s;iah could never die, an opinion which Judas might ea&s;ily embrace, having &s;een his Ma&s;ter rai&s;e &s;everal per&s;ons, and among the re&s;t, one who had been in the grave no le&s;s than four days.</P>
<P>IT is probable that the traitor's intention in betraying his Ma&s;ter, was that mentioned above, from his hanging him&s;elf when he found him condemned, not by the governor, but by the council, who&s;e prerogative it was, to judge prophets. Had Judas propo&s;ed to take away the life of his Ma&s;ter, the &s;entence of condemnation pa&s;&s;ed upon him, in&s;tead of filling him with de&s;pair, mu&s;t have gratified him, being the accompli&s;hment of his project: whereas, this circum&s;tance is &s;hewn to have been perfectly natural, by the light wherein we have endeavoured to place his conduct.</P>
<P>HAVING been witne&s;s to the greate&s;t part of our Lord's miracles, and having experi|enced the certain truth of them, in the powers that had been conferred upon him&s;elf, Judas could never think that the council would have condemned him as an impo&s;tor, far le&s;s, as a bla&s;phemer; he knew him to be perfectly innocent, and expected that he would have wrought &s;uch miracles before the council, as &s;hould have con&s;trained them to be|lieve: therefore, when he found nothing of this kind was done, and that the prie&s;ts had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;entence of condemnation upon him, and were carrying him to the go|vernor to get it executed, he repented of his ra&s;h and covetous project, came to the chief prie&s;ts and elders, the per&s;ons to whom he had betrayed him, offered them their money again, and &s;olemnly declared the deepe&s;t conviction of his Ma&s;ter's innocence, hoping that they would have de&s;i&s;ted from the pro&s;ecution; but they were ob&s;tinate, and would not relent: upon which his remor&s;e aro&s;e to &s;uch a pitch, that, unable to &s;upport the torments of his con&s;cience, he went and hanged him&s;elf. Thus I think it probable, that the traitor's intention in delivering up his Ma&s;ter, was not to get him puni&s;hed with death, but only to lay him under a nece&s;&s;ity of proving his preten&s;ions before the grandees, whom he had hitherto &s;hunned; thinking that the whole nation would immediately have &s;ubmitted, and the di&s;ciples have been rai&s;ed forthwith to the &s;ummit of their expectations, if they had yielded.</P>
<P>BUT this account of Judas's conduct, is by no means calculated to le&s;&s;en the foulne&s;s of his crime, which was the blacke&s;t imaginable: for, even in the light above mentioned, it implied both an in&s;atiable avarice, and a wilful oppo&s;ition to the coun&s;els of Provi|dence, and rendered the actor of it a di&s;grace to human nature: but it is calculated to &s;et the credibility of the traitor's action in a proper light, and to &s;hew that he was not moved to it by any thing &s;u&s;picious in the character of his Ma&s;ter; becau&s;e, according to this view of it, his perfidy, in&s;tead of implying that he entertained &s;u&s;picions of his Ma&s;ter's integrity, plainly proved that he had the fulle&s;t conviction of his being the Me&s;&s;iah: and to &s;ay the truth, it was not po&s;&s;ible for any one intimately acquainted with our Lord, as Judas was, to judge otherwi&s;e of him; having &s;een his miracles, which were great and true beyond exception, and having experienced his power, in the ability of working miracles, which he had received from him, and, no doubt, exerci&s;ed with extraordinary plea&s;ure, together with the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles.</P>

<P>Our Saviour in&s;titutes the Sacrament of his Supper: He checketh the ambitious Strife of his Di&s;|ciples, and promi&s;eth them a Share in his Kingdom: He telleth Peter of Satan's de&s;ire to &s;ift him, but that his Faith &s;hould be &s;upported; and yet he &s;hould thrice deny him: He advi&s;eth his Di&s;ciples to provide Nece&s;&s;aries, and to arm them&s;elves again&s;t the Day of Trial: He pro|mi&s;eth them Power to do greater Works than his own, and the Grant of all that they &s;hould a&s;k in his Name: He requireth their Obedience, as a Proof of their Love, and giveth them a Promi&s;e of the Comforter, the Holy Gho&s;t.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT does not appear that our Saviour was in the lea&s;t di&s;turbed at the con&s;ideration of the treachery of Judas; for, in order to render his love to mankind more effectual, he in&s;tituted the &s;acrament of his &s;upper, to perpetuate the memory of it throughout all ages. Accordingly, as they were eating the pa&s;chal-&s;upper, <HI>Je&s;us took bread, and ble&s;&s;ed it, and brake it, and gave it to the di&s;ciples, and &s;aid, Take, eat; this is my body, which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me,</HI> ob&s;erve this rite no longer in remembrance of your deliverance from Egypt, but in remembrance of me; who by dying, for you, will bring you out of the &s;piritual bondage, a bonage far wor&s;e than the Egyptian, under which your fathers groaned, and will e&s;tabli&s;h you in the glorious liberty of the children of God: do it in remembrance of me, who, by laying down my life, will ran&s;om you from &s;in, from death, from hell, and, that you may enter immortality in triumph, will &s;et open the gates of heaven to you.</P>
<P>AFTER having given the bread to his di&s;ciples, he al&s;o took the cup and gave it to them, &s;aying, <HI>Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of the New Te&s;tament, which is &s;hed for many for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> All of you, and all of my di&s;ciples in all ages, mu&s;t drink of this cup, becau&s;e it repre&s;ents my blood &s;hed for the remi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ins of mankind; my blood, by which the new covenant between God and man is ratified: it is therefore my blood of the new covenant, &s;o that this in&s;titution exhibits to your joyful meditation, the grand ba&s;is of the hopes of the children of men, and perpetu|ates the memory of it to the end of the world. He added, <HI>I will not drink hence forth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</HI> Matt. xxvi.29.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t illu&s;trious, the mo&s;t momentous event that is po&s;&s;ible to engage the meditations of mankind, in the manife&s;tation of the Son of God: to his life and death, his re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion into glory, we are indebted for our hopes and a&s;&s;urances of pardon, for our peace, for our happine&s;s: to procure our benefit, he made the mo&s;t amazing conde&s;cen&s;ion from the dignity he enjoyed with his Father by put|ting
<PB N="220" REF="029927_0229_0FE33894ED191310">
on the veil of fle&s;h; he poured divine in&s;truction from his lips, and &s;hone forth with an all-perfect and all-lovely example: for our benefit, he &s;ubmitted to a cour&s;e of the mo&s;t cruel treatment of his bitter enemies, to the agonies of the cro&s;s and to the &s;troke of the king of terrors: for our benefit, he aro&s;e again with power and lu&s;tre, a&s;cended into the man&s;ions of eternal happine&s;s, intercedes for us with the Almighty, and holdeth the reins of government. And &s;hall the amiable, the excellent, the benifi|cial actions of this Saviour, be buried in oblivion? Forbid it gratitude, duty, intere&s;t! Forbid it, every con&s;ideration that can affect the human mind! With the greate&s;t wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s this benificient JESUS in&s;tituted a rite that &s;hould recal his love to our memories, and awake each pious pa&s;&s;ion in our brea&s;ts; a rite which, by the breaking of bread, and the pouring out of wine &s;hould repre&s;ent to us, in a &s;triking manner, that mo&s;t &s;ignal proof of the affection, both of him and his heavenly Father, when his tender frame was expo&s;ed to wounds and brui&s;es, when &s;treams of the mo&s;t precious blood i&s;&s;ued from his &s;acred veins. And the more we reflect on this in&s;tance of divine love, the more we &s;hall perceive that there was a peculiar propriety in point|ing out, by a particular ordinance, a fact of &s;uch immen&s;e importance in the &s;y&s;tem of revelation! Nay, we may even venture to a&s;&s;ert, that in &s;ome dark and corrupt ages, when the Scriptures were little known by the common people, and hardly &s;tudied by the prie&s;ts, the death of our Saviour, had not the remembrance of it been renewed by the celebration of this &s;acred ordinance, would have been almo&s;t forgotten.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould al&s;o remember, that the vanities of the world, the allurements of &s;en|&s;ual plea&s;ure, the charms of ambition, the &s;plendour of riches; in &s;hort, temptations from pre&s;ent objects of every kind, have often too fatal an influence on our temper and conduct; they have a melancholy aptitude to draw the &s;oul a&s;ide to folly, and to obliterate the impre&s;&s;ions of things divine. It was, therefore, a wi&s;e, a kind intention of our great Redeemer, by a frequent repetition of the &s;acramental fea&s;t to call back the wandering heart of man to a &s;en&s;e of his duty and obligations as a Chri&s;tian. Be&s;ides, though the religion of the immaculate JESUS is altogether gentle, generous, and beneficient; though its whole tendency is to correct the pa&s;&s;ions, &s;weeten the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> po&s;itions, and enlarge the affection of men; and though it enforces all this upon us by motives &s;urpri&s;ingly powerful and affecting; yet &s;uch is the perver&s;ene&s;s of the hu|man heart, that jealou&s;ies and contentions, envy, wrath, and malice, too often find admittance there. Was it not then an in&s;tance of our Saviour's wi&s;dom and benevo|lence, by uniting us together at the &s;acrament of his body and blood, to in&s;pire us with conde&s;cen&s;ion, compa&s;&s;ion, and love, and to urge the putting away all bitterne&s;s, anger, evil-&s;peaking, and revenge.</P>
<P>WE ought, therefore, to be very careful how we perform this duty appointed by our dying Saviour? We &s;hould, in order to receive it worthily, employ our meditation on the de&s;ign and excellency of the go&s;pel; on the noble &s;y&s;tem of doctrines and duties it contains; on the illu&s;trious, divine, and complete example of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS; on the important privileges, the valuable promi&s;es, and the ravi&s;hing pro&s;pects his revelation affords; and on the bright and convincing evidence with which it is attended. We &s;hould contemplate that e&s;&s;ential and unparelleled benevolence of the Deity, in forming the way for our redemption, on the readine&s;s manife&s;ted by the Son of God, in under|taking our cau&s;e; and on his wonderful tran&s;actions in the pro&s;ecution of this grand, this amazing work: above all, we &s;hould impre&s;s upon our &s;ouls a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the &s;pecial and immediate purpo&s;es for which this &s;acramen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was appointed, and when we actually join in communion, we &s;hould be careful that our affections be properly directed, and warmly engaged.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="029927_0230_0FE33896737AF868">TO have our hearts fixed upon the vanities, the profits, and the cares of this world, is a direct violation of the ordinance; and therefore we &s;hould be extremely careful to maintain a right temper and behaviour at that time. We &s;hould &s;tudy to ab&s;tract our thoughts as much as po&s;&s;ible, from every foreign, every terre&s;tial con&s;ideration, and to have our pa&s;&s;ion fervently employed in the &s;olemn &s;ervice. 'Retire, O my &s;oul,' each of us &s;hould &s;ay, 'from this inferior &s;cene of things, from all its plea&s;ures and all its pur&s;uits, and hold communion with the Almighty and his Son, the immaculate JESUS. Meditate upon that infinite grace of omnipotence, which contrived the amazing plan, that di&s;playeth pardon, peace, and endle&s;s happine&s;s to &s;o unde&s;erving a creature as thou art. Recollect that &s;urpri&s;ing conde&s;cen&s;ion and tenderne&s;s of thy compa&s;&s;ionate Re|deemer, which induced him to bring down from heaven, &s;alvation to the &s;ons of men. Call to mind the admirable in&s;tructions he offered, the charming pattern he exhibited, the hard labours and &s;ufferings he endured in the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try; e&s;pecially call to mind the ignominy, the reproaches, the agonies he endured when he hung upon the cro&s;s, and purcha&s;ed for thee eternal mercy. Think upon the&s;e affecting &s;ubjects, till thine heart is filled with &s;orrow for thine iniquities; till thy faith becomes lively, active, and fruitful; till thy gratitude and love are elevated to the highe&s;t pitch; till thy obedience is rendered uniform, &s;teady and complete. Ha&s;t thou, O my God, and Parent of uni|ver&s;al nature! ha&s;t thou &s;o illu&s;triou&s;ly manife&s;ted thy compa&s;&s;ion for &s;inners, as not to &s;pare thine own Son? Ha&s;t thou &s;ent the Saviour into this lower world, in order to rai&s;e the children of men to immortality, perfection, and glory? And am I now in thy pre&s;ence, on purpo&s;e to celebrate this in&s;titution, which requireth me to commemorate the death of the great Me&s;&s;iah; to declare my public acceptance of his excellent reve|lation, and my regard to my Chri&s;tian brethren? May then the remembrance of his benificence, dwell upon my mind, and upon my tongue for ever and ever! May I con|&s;ider and comply with the intention of his go&s;pel; and may the &s;entiments of kindne&s;s and charity towards my fellow-mortals, and fellow-di&s;ciples, with increa&s;ing purity, with increa&s;ing zeal, reign in my brea&s;t.'</P>
<P>WHEN we partake of this &s;acred ordinance, &s;uch are the views that &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s our &s;ouls: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut it will &s;ignify little to entertain the&s;e views at that time, unle&s;s the effects of them are apparent in our future conduct and conver&s;ation; for a tran&s;ient flow of af|fections, or &s;allies of immediate delight, were not principally intended in this in&s;titution. The ble&s;&s;ed JESUS did not ordain it as a ceremony or charm, but as a proper method of e&s;tabli&s;hing our hearts in virtuous and pious di&s;po&s;itions. Though ye have, there|fore, O Chri&s;tians, obeyed the Redeemer's command in this appointment, and found your pa&s;&s;ions greatly moved, yet this is not the whole required at your hands; it will ju&s;tly be expected, that ye &s;hould live to the honour of your divine Ma&s;ter. As you have &s;olemnly profe&s;&s;ed your faith in him, and your love towards him, the reality of your faith and love &s;hould be demon&s;trated by walking more &s;trictly in the way of his precepts, and by abounding in that heavenly character and temper, which his &s;potle&s;s example &s;o engagingly recommends: thus only will the &s;acrament become &s;ub&s;ervient to the mo&s;t beneficial purpo&s;es; thus only will it be in&s;trumental in qualifying us for &s;haring in the dignity and felicity po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by our exalted Saviour. May, therefore, all the followers of the immaculate JESUS, advance from holine&s;s to holine&s;s, till they arrive at the regions of eternal felicity, by uniting together at his &s;acred table.</P>
<P>HAVING thus in&s;tituted his la&s;t &s;upper, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour was deeply affected with his own thoughts: and after delivering the &s;acramental cup, telling them that his blood was &s;hed for them, he mentioned the treachery of Judas a &s;econd time: <HI>But, behold, the
<PB N="222" REF="029927_0231_0FE33897F81D43D0">
hand of him that betrayeth me, is with me on the table.</HI> This &s;econd declaration was made very properly after the in&s;titution of the &s;acrament, which exhibits the highe&s;t in&s;tance of our great Redeemer's love to mankind, his dying to obtain the remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins; for it abundantly proves, that the per&s;on who could deliberately be guilty of &s;uch an injury to &s;o kind a friend, mu&s;t have been a mon&s;ter, the foulne&s;s of who&s;e ingratitude, cannot be reached by the force of language. Some of the di&s;ciples, particularly &s;truck with horror at the thought of Judas's treachery, rebuked him, by a&s;king him with &s;ur|pri&s;e, how he could betray his Ma&s;ter? This accu&s;ation, Judas, no doubt, repelled, by impudently denying the fact; but con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, giving edge to the reproaches of his brethren, and to every circum&s;tance of the affair, he, thinking him&s;elf affronted, immediately left the company, exceedingly di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's &s;ufferings were now at hand: the traitor Judas was gone to the chief prie&s;ts and elders, for a band of &s;oldiers to apprehend him; but this did not di&s;compo&s;e the Redeemer of mankind; he took occa&s;ion to meditate on the glory that would accrue both to him&s;elf and to the Almighty, from tho&s;e &s;ufferings, and &s;pake of it to his di&s;ciples: <HI>Now,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is the Son of man Glorified, and God is glorified in him.</HI> He al&s;o told them, that having already done honour to his Father, by the pa&s;t actions of his life, and being about to honour him yet further by his &s;ufferings and death, which would di&s;play his perfections, particularly his infinite love to the human race, in the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing and amiable light, he was in his turn to receive honour from the Almighty; intimating that his human nature was to be exalted to the right hand of Omnipotence, and that his mi&s;&s;ion from God was to be &s;upported by irrefragable at|te&s;tation. But his di&s;ciples, imagining that he &s;pake of the glory of a temporal king|dom, their ambition was again revived, and they began to di&s;pute with as much keen|ne&s;s as ever, which of them &s;hould be the greate&s;t in that kingdom. This contention, JESUS compo&s;ed by the arguments he had formerly u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Among&s;t the Gentiles, &s;aid he, they are reckoned the greate&s;t, who have the greate&s;t power, and have exerci&s;ed it in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute manner: but your greatne&s;s &s;hall be very different from theirs; it &s;hall not con&s;i&s;t in being unlimited with regard to tyrannical power, even though it &s;hould be joined with an affection of titles, which denote qualities truly honour|able; but who&s;oever de&s;ires to be great, or chief among you, let him be &s;o by his humi|lity, and the &s;ervice he renders to the re&s;t, in imitation of me your Ma&s;ter, who&s;e great|ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in this, that I am become the &s;ervant of you: adding, as they had conti|nued with him in this temptation, he would be&s;tow upon them &s;uch a kingdom, as his Father had appointed for them. At the &s;ame time, to check their ambition, and lead them to form a ju&s;t notion of his kingdom, he told them, that he was &s;oon to leave them, and that whither he was going, they could not at that time, follow him; for which rea&s;on, in&s;tead of contending with one another, which of them &s;hould be the greate&s;t, they would do well to be united among them&s;elves, in the happy bond of love: for, by loving one another &s;incerely and fervently, they would prove them&s;elves his di&s;ciples, to the conviction of mankind, who could not be ignorant, that the di&s;tingui&s;hing part of his character was love.</P>
<P>OUR Lord called this a new commandment, not becau&s;e mutual love had never been enjoined to mankind before, but becau&s;e it was a precept of peculiar excellency: for the word <HI>new</HI> in the Hebrew language, denotes excellency and truth: and the rea|&s;on of this idiom &s;eems to have been, that novelty oftentimes has the &s;ame effect upon the mind as excellency, rendering an object acceptable, and rai&s;ing admiration: he al|&s;o called this a new commandment, becau&s;e they were to exerci&s;e it under a new re|lation,
<PB N="223" REF="029927_0232_0FE338A4F72B1F88">
according to a new mea&s;ure, and from new motives: they were to love one another in the relation of his di&s;ciples, and in that degree of love which he had &s;hewed to them; for they were to lay down their lives for the brethren. This excellent morality, however, did not make &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on Peter, as the words which JESUS had &s;poken concerning a place whither his di&s;ciples could not come: he therefore replied, by a&s;king where he was going? To which JESUS an&s;wered, <HI>Whither I go, thou can&s;t not follow me now; but thou &s;halt follow me afterwards.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to make his di&s;ciples humble, watchful, and kindly-affectionate one to|wards another, he a&s;&s;ured them, that Satan was &s;eeking to ruin them all by his tempa|tions: <HI>And the Lord &s;aid, Simon, Simon, Behold, Satan hath de&s;ired to have you, that he may &s;ift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, &s;trengthen thy brethren.</HI> Peter was greatly offended that his Ma&s;ter &s;hould have &s;ingled him out as the weake&s;t; for &s;o he interpreted his praying for him parti|cularly: and &s;uppo&s;ing that he mentioned Satan's &s;eeking to &s;ift him, as a thing which would hinder him from following his Ma&s;ter, replied, Why cannot I follow thee now? Is there any road more terrible than the dark valley of the &s;hadow of death? Yet, I am willing this moment to accompany thee through the&s;e black and gloomy &s;hades.</P>
<P>BUT JESUS knowing his weak, though &s;incere re&s;olution, an&s;wered, art thou &s;o very confident of thine own &s;trength? <HI>I tell thee, Peter, the cock &s;hall not crow this day, before that thou &s;halt thrice deny that thou knowe&s;t me,</HI> Luke xxii.34.</P>
<P>OUR dear Lord having fini&s;hed what he had to &s;ay to Peter in particular, turned him&s;elf to his other di&s;ciples, and put them in mind, how that, when they were fir&s;t &s;ent out, he directed them to rely wholly upon the Almighty for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. 'When I &s;ent you formerly,' &s;aid he, 'to preach the go&s;pel, you may remember, I ordered you to go without any provi&s;ion either for your &s;u&s;tenance or defence, a&s;&s;uring you, that though you would indeed meet with great oppo&s;ition, yet Providence would di&s;|po&s;e &s;ome men in all places to be your friends, and to furni&s;h you with all nece&s;&s;aries; and, accordingly, you found that you wanted for nothing, but were wonderfully &s;up|ported without any care or provi&s;ion of your own in the whole journey, and fini&s;hed your work with &s;ucce&s;s. But now the ca&s;e is very different; the time of that greate&s;t trial and di&s;tre&s;s, whereof I have often forewarned you, is ju&s;t at hand; and you may now make all the provi&s;ion in your power, and arm your&s;elves again&s;t it as much as you are able: the time, I &s;ay, of the greate&s;t trial and di&s;tre&s;s that ever yet befel you, is now at hand; for I am ju&s;t going to be betrayed into the hands of my inveterate enemies. I have fini&s;hed the work for which I was &s;ent into the world; and nothing now remains for me, but to undergo tho&s;e &s;ufferings which the prophets have foretold con|cerning me, and, by &s;ubmitting at la&s;t to a mo&s;t cruel and ignominious death, to complete this whole di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence.' The di&s;ciples thinking that their great Ma&s;ter meant, that they &s;hould arm them&s;elves in a literal &s;en&s;e, and endeavour to oppo&s;e the a&s;|&s;aults that would &s;hortly be made upon them by the Jews, an&s;wered, <HI>Lord here are two &s;words:</HI> but the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, who only intended to convey an idea of their approaching di&s;tre&s;s and temptations, and to arm them again&s;t the &s;urpri&s;e, replied. <HI>It is enough.</HI></P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour having thus forewarned his di&s;ciples of the great trial that was coming upon them, and commanded them to arm them&s;elves again&s;t it, proceeded to animate them to &s;u&s;tain the trial manfully, and to comfort them under the di&s;mal ap|prehen&s;ions it might cau&s;e in their minds. Be not terrified and di&s;con&s;olate, &s;aid the compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer of mankind, becau&s;e I have told you that I mu&s;t undergo

<P><PB N="225" REF="029927_0235_0FE338A98D5479C0">AS being my di&s;ciples, and in order to promote the work of the go&s;pel, what&s;oever ye &s;hall a&s;k of my Father, in my name, &s;hall certainly be granted you: that God may be greatly glorified, by the extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s and &s;preading the religion of his Son, I &s;ay, that what&s;oever ye &s;hall a&s;k, I will take care, that after my return to the Father, it &s;hall be granted you; only ye mu&s;t remember, as the nece&s;&s;ary condition upon which all depends, that ye be careful above all things, to continue &s;teadfa&s;t and immovable in your obedience to my commands: this is the only true mark ye can give of the &s;incerity of your love towards me; it is more than your grieving at my departure.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, the Father &s;hall &s;end you another advocate and comforter, even his Holy Spirit, the author and teacher of truth, who &s;hall guide and direct, a&s;&s;i&s;t and comfort you in all ca&s;es. This Spirit, the &s;en&s;ual and corrupt world cannot receive, having no know|ledge of him, nor di&s;po&s;ition to be governed by him; but ye know him, and are di&s;|po&s;ed to entertain him: he is already in you, by his &s;ecret and invi&s;ible efficacy; and &s;hall hereafter appear in you openly, by great and vi&s;ible manife&s;tations of him&s;elf. Thus, though I mu&s;t depart from you, yet I do by no means leave you comfortle&s;s: I leave with you a promi&s;e of the Holy Spirit, and I leave you in expectation al&s;o of my own return: for though, after a very little while, I &s;hall appear no more to the world; yet, as I &s;hall live again, and ye al&s;o &s;hall live with me, to you I will appear.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, when I have conquered and triumphed over death, ye &s;hall under&s;tand more fully, and it &s;hall apppear more vi&s;ible by great and manife&s;t effects, that I act, in all things, agreeable to my Father's will, and am perfectly inve&s;ted with his power; and that ye in like manner, have my power and commi&s;&s;ion communicated to you: &s;o that there is a perfect unity and community between us; only ye mu&s;t remember, that the one nece&s;&s;ary condition, on which all depends, is, that ye continue &s;teadfa&s;t and im|movable in your faith in me, and in your obedience to my commands. He, and he only, who embraces my doctrine, and obeys and practi&s;es it, &s;hall be judged to be &s;incere in his love towards me: <HI>And he that loveth me, &s;hall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manife&s;t my&s;elf to him.</HI></P>
<P>JUDAS Thaddeus here interrupted his Ma&s;ter, &s;aying, <HI>Lord, how is it that thou wilt manife&s;t thy&s;elf unto us, and not unto the world?</HI></P>
<P>TO which JESUS replied, I have already told you the rea&s;on of my acting in this manner; becau&s;e the generality of the world are not di&s;po&s;ed to obey my command|ments, the nece&s;&s;ary condition of maintaining communion with me: but ye are di&s;po&s;ed to embrace my doctrine, and to obey it; and, therefore, I manife&s;t my&s;elf to you. And whoever el&s;e will &s;o love me as to keep my commandments, him al&s;o will I and my Father love, and will maintain communion with him, and all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings &s;hall be poured down upon him, and he &s;hall be made partaker of happine&s;s and eternal life. On the contrary, whoever loves me not, that is, obeys not my commandments, &s;hall have no intercour&s;e or communion with me; neither will my Father love or honor him, or make any manife&s;tations of him&s;elf to him: for as my commandments are not my own, but the Father's commandments, therefore, whoever di&s;honours me, my Father will look upon him as di&s;honouring him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have briefly &s;poken the&s;e things unto you now, according to the &s;hortne&s;s of the time I am to continue with you, and to comfort you for the pre&s;ent, again&s;t my depar|ture. But when the comforter whom I promi&s;ed you is come, even the Holy Spirit, whom my Father &s;hall &s;end you on my account, &s;hall in&s;truct you more fully, recalling to your remembrance what you have forgotten, explaining what is yet ob&s;cure, and
<PB N="226" REF="029927_0236_0FE338B3DF2B7E00">
&s;upplying what is further nece&s;&s;ary to be taught you, and to be under&s;tood by you. In the mean time I take my leave of you, and my ble&s;&s;ing I leave with you; not formally, and after the common fa&s;hion of the world, but affectionately and &s;incerely, retaining a careful remembrance of you, and with an earne&s;t de&s;ire and intention of returning again &s;peedily to you. Wherefore, be not overmuch grieved for me and my departure, nor fearful of what may then befal your&s;elves: I go away from you, but it is with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> intention, as I have already told you, to return to you again. If you loved me with a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding affection, you would rejoice in&s;tead of grieving at my pre&s;ent departure; becau&s;e I am going to the Supreme Author of all glory and happine&s;s, even to my Father.</P>
<P>I have now told you the&s;e things before they come to pa&s;s, that when ye &s;ee them happen, your faith in me, and your expectation of the performance of all my promi&s;es, may be confirmed and &s;trengthened; the time will not allow me to &s;ay much more to you at pre&s;ent; my end draweth near; the ruler of this world, the prince of the power of darkne&s;s, is at this in&s;tant employing all his wicked in&s;truments to apprehend and de&s;troy me: not that either the power of the Devil, or the malice of man, can at all prevail over me, but becau&s;e the time of my &s;uffering, according to the appointment of Divine Wi&s;dom, is arrived; and that I may demon&s;trate to the world my love and obedience to my Father, I willingly &s;ubmit my&s;elf to be put to death by the hands of &s;inful and cruel men. Ri&s;e up, let us be going, that I may enter on my &s;ufferings. See John, chap. xiv. ver. 1, to the end.</P>
<P>THUS having &s;poken, they fini&s;hed the pa&s;&s;over with &s;inging a hymn, and went out to the Mount of Olives. The hymn which they &s;ung was probably that which the Jews call the <HI>Hallem,</HI> or great hymn, which con&s;i&s;ted of the hundred and thirteenth and five &s;ub&s;equent P&s;alms; part of which was &s;ung at the beginning of the &s;olemnity, and part at the end.</P>
<P>WHEN they arrived at the place which was to be the &s;cene of his &s;ufferings, he de&s;ired them to fortify them&s;elves by prayer, and forewarned them of the terrible effects his &s;uf|ferings would have upon them; they would make them all &s;tumble that very night, agreeable to the prophecy of Zechariah: <HI>I will &s;mile the &s;hepherd, and the &s;heep of the flock &s;hall be &s;cattered abroad.</HI> Therefore, he not only mentioned his own re&s;urrection, but told them they &s;hould &s;ee him in Galilee, after he was ri&s;en from the dead, in order to &s;trengthen their faith.</P>
<P>PETER, on our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's mentioning the offence that his di&s;ciples would take at his &s;ufferings, recollected what had been &s;aid to him in particular, before they left the hou&s;e. Grieving therefore afre&s;h, to find his Ma&s;ter entertain &s;uch thoughts of him, and being now armed with a &s;word, the vehemence of his temper urged him to boa&s;t a &s;econd time of his courageous and clo&s;e attachment to his Ma&s;ter: <HI>Though all men,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;hould be offended becau&s;e of thee, yet will I never be offended.</HI> But JESUS, knowing that confidence and &s;ecurity are great enemies to virtue, thought proper to forewarn him again&s;t his dan|ger, and told him, that the cock &s;hould not crow before he had denied him. Peter, however, &s;till continued to repeat his confidence, I will die with thee, but never deny thee. The di&s;ciples all joined with Peter in profe&s;&s;ing their fixed re&s;olution of &s;uffering death, rather than they would deny their Ma&s;ter; but the event fully confirmed the pre|dictions of our Saviour. From whence we may learn, how ignorant men are of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>OUR dear Lord, not willing to lo&s;e one &s;ingle moment of the &s;hort time of his mini&s;try that yet remained, continued to in&s;truct his di&s;ciples in the great truths he came into the
<PB N="227" REF="029927_0237_0FE338B56374ACE8">
world to explain; and from the vines, which were growing round him on the Mount of Olives, he began his excellent di&s;cour&s;e, with the parable of the vine, which we &s;hall endeavour to explain in the following manner.</P>
<P>HITHERTO, &s;aid the compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer of mankind, the Jewi&s;h church and nation have been the peculiar care of Providence; as a choice and a goodly vine, likely to bring forth much fruit, is the e&s;pecial care of the hu&s;bandmen: but from henceforth, my church, my di&s;ciples, and the profe&s;&s;ors of my religion, of what&s;oever country or nation they be, &s;hall become the people of God, and the peculiar care of Divine Pro|vidence&punc; I will be to them as the root and &s;tock of a vine, of which my Father is the hu&s;bandman and vine-dre&s;&s;er, and they are the branches.</P>
<P>AS the &s;kilful vine-dre&s;&s;er, in the management of a choice vine, cuts off all barren and &s;uperfluous branches, that they may not burden nor exhau&s;t the tree and prunes, and dre&s;&s;es the fruitful branches, that they may grow continually, and bear more fruit: &s;o in the government of my church, all u&s;ele&s;s, wicked, and incorrigible members, my Father, by his ju&s;t judgment, cuts off and de&s;troys; but tho&s;e who are &s;incerely pious and good, he, by the various and merciful di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence towards them, tries, purifies, and amends, that they may daily improve and be more and more abun|dant in all good works. Now ye, my apo&s;tles, are &s;uch members as the&s;e, being purified in heart and mind, and prepared for every good work, by your lively faith in me, and &s;incere re&s;olutions to obey my commands. Continue &s;teadfa&s;tly in this &s;tate, and then you may be &s;ure of deriving all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings from me, as the branches receive &s;ap and nouri&s;hment from the vine: but as a branch, without continuing in the vine, cannot bear any fruit, but pre&s;ently dries up and peri&s;hes; &s;o ye, unle&s;s ye continue &s;teadfa&s;t in your communion with me, by a lively faith and &s;incere obedience, &s;o as to receive grace and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, can never bring forth any good fruit of true holine&s;s and right+eou&s;ne&s;s, but will fall into vanity, &s;uper&s;tition, and wickedne&s;s, and will utterly peri&s;h at la&s;t. I &s;ay, I am, as it were, the root and &s;tock of the vine, whereof ye are the branches: he that continues to adhere to me, by con&s;tant faith in me, by imitating my example, and by obeying my commands, &s;hall bring forth much fruit, of true virtue and holine&s;s, unto everla&s;ting life; even as a branch which continues to grow in a vine, and receives &s;ap and nouri&s;hment from it: but he that does not continue his relation to me in this manner, is a fal&s;e and u&s;ele&s;s profe&s;&s;or of my religion, and &s;hall be ca&s;t out from me, and peri&s;h for ever; even as a fruitle&s;s branch is cut off from the vine, and left to whither and dry, and is at la&s;t burnt in the fire&punc; but if ye continue in me, by believing my words, and holding fa&s;t what ye believe, and obeying and practi&s;ing it, no power, or malice, either of men or of devils, &s;hall be able to hurt you, or oppo&s;e your doctrines: for though I be ab&s;ent from you in the body, yet I will hear your prayers, and my Father him&s;elf al&s;o will hear you; and what&s;oever ye &s;hall a&s;k, for the glory of the Almighty, and the propa|gation of my true religion in the world, &s;hall certainly be granted you: but, above all things, carefully remember to demon&s;trate your continuance in me, by abounding in all good works of holine&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and charity. This is the honour which my Father de&s;ires and expects from you, even as it is the glory and de&s;ire of a vine-dre&s;&s;er, that his vine &s;hould bring forth much fruit; and this is the honour that I my&s;elf expect from you, that ye &s;hould prove your&s;elves to be really and indeed my di&s;ciples, by imi|tating my example, and obeying my commands: this ye are bound to do, not only in duty, but in gratitude al&s;o; for as my Father hath loved me, &s;o have I al&s;o loved you, and ye in like manner ought to love me again, that you may continue to be loved by me: but the way to expre&s;s your love towards me, and to continue to be loved by me, is to keep my commandments; even as I, by keeping my Father's commandments, have expre&s;&s;ed my love towards him, and continue to be loved by him.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="029927_0238_0FE338B711BFE648">I have &s;poken to you the&s;e things before my departure, that the comfort ye have taken in my pre&s;ence, may be continued in my ab&s;ence, and even increa&s;ed at the coming of the Holy Spirit, as it will be upon this condition, which I have &s;o often repeated to you, that you keep my commandments: and the principal of the&s;e commandments is, that ye love one another, not after the common fa&s;hion of the world, but in &s;uch a man|ner as I have loved you; nor can you be ignorant what &s;ort of love that is, when I tell you that I am now going to lay down my life for you: this is the highe&s;t in&s;tance, in which it is po&s;&s;ible for man to expre&s;s his love towards his greate&s;t friends and benefac|tors; and this I am now going to do for you, and for all mankind: I do not con&s;ider you as my benefactors, but as my friends, upon this ea&s;y condition only, that ye keep my commandments. I might, indeed, ju&s;tly call you &s;ervants, con&s;idering the infinite di&s;tance between me and you, and the obligation ye have to obey my commandments: but I have not treated you as &s;ervants, who are not admitted into their ma&s;ter's councils, but as friends, revealing to you with all freedom and plainne&s;s, the whole will of my Father.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, I have behaved my&s;elf to you, as to the neare&s;t friends; not that you fir&s;t obliged me, or did any acts of kindne&s;s for me, but I have freely, and of my own good plea&s;ure, cho&s;en you to be my apo&s;tles, and the preachers of my go&s;pel, that you may go and declare the will of God to the world, and bring forth much and la&s;ting fruit, in the conver&s;ion of men to the knowledge of the truth, and to the profe&s;&s;ion and practice of true religion and virtue. In the performance of this work, what&s;oever ye &s;hall a&s;k of my Father in my name, it &s;hall certainly be granted you, in order to enable you to per|form it effectually, and with full &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e things which I have &s;poken unto you, concerning the greatne&s;s of my love towards you, in choo&s;ing you to be my apo&s;tles, in revealing unto you the whole will of my Father, and in laying down my life for you; I have urged and inculcated upon you this rea&s;on chiefly, as I at fir&s;t told you, that ye may learn, after my example, to <HI>love one another.</HI> The world, indeed, you mu&s;t expect, will hate and per&s;ecute you upon my account; but this you ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed or terrified at, knowing that I my|&s;elf have met with the &s;ame treatment before you.</P>
<P>BUT the rea&s;on why the generality of the world have oppo&s;ed and per&s;ecuted me, is becau&s;e my doctrine is incon&s;i&s;tent with their lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, their covetou&s;ne&s;s and unju&s;t ambition; and, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, there is no doubt but they will oppo&s;e and per&s;ecute you al&s;o. If ye were of the &s;pirit of the world, flattering men in their &s;ins, and teaching doctrines con&s;i&s;tent with their lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, the world, doubtle&s;s, would love and honour you: but &s;ince I have cho&s;en you out of the world, to reprove its vices, and to preach the nece&s;&s;ity of reformation, and of men amending their lives, if the world hate and per&s;ecute you, wonder not.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, be not &s;urpri&s;ed, when ye meet with oppo&s;ition; nor think to find better treatment in the world, than I my&s;elf have done. Remember what I have already told you, that the di&s;ciple is not above his Ma&s;ter, nor is he that is &s;ent, greater than he that &s;ent him. If men had generally and readily embraced my doctrine, you might, indeed, have had &s;ome rea&s;on to expect, that they would willingly have received yours al&s;o: but &s;ince I my&s;elf have &s;uffered great indignities and per&s;ecutions from wicked and per|ver&s;e, from ob&s;tinate and incorrigible men, only for oppo&s;ing their vices, it is highly rea&s;onable that you &s;hould expect to undergo the like treatment upon the like account: in all which &s;ufferings you will moreover have this comfortable con&s;ideration to &s;upport
<PB N="229" REF="029927_0239_0FE338B895C038D8">
you, that the ju&s;tice of your own cau&s;e, and the inju&s;tice of your per&s;ecutors, will by that very means mo&s;t evidently appear: &s;eeing ye are per&s;ecuted only for profe&s;&s;ing and preaching in my name, the doctrine of true religion and virtue; and they per&s;ecute you only, becau&s;e they know not God, and out of mere malice will not bear to be in|&s;tructed in his command. Indeed, had not I appeared to the world with all po&s;&s;ible demon&s;trations of authority and truth, teaching men, a mo&s;t holy and undeniable doc|trine, &s;ufficient to reform their manners and amend their lives, and moreover demon|&s;trating my divine commi&s;&s;ion, by &s;uch proofs as ought to &s;atisfy and convince the mo&s;t doubting and &s;u&s;picious minds; they might have had &s;ome plea and excu&s;e of igno|rance for their unbelief; but now, &s;ince all rea&s;onable evidence has been offered them, and proper methods u&s;ed for their conver&s;ion and &s;alvation, and yet they wilfully and ob&s;tinately reject the&s;e means of grace, it is plain they have no excu&s;e for their &s;in; but they oppo&s;e and per&s;ecute you only becau&s;e they will not for&s;ake their worldly lu&s;ts, and out of mere malice will not bear to be in&s;tructed in the commands of the Almighty: &s;o that they who oppo&s;e and per&s;ecute you, as they have before per&s;ecuted me, &s;hew plainly that they are haters of God, and of his mo&s;t holy commandments; which is, as I have already told you, a plain evidence of the inju&s;tice of your per&s;ecutors, and of the ju&s;tice of your own ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, if I had not done &s;uch works among&s;t them as no man ever did, they might, indeed, have had &s;ome appearance of excu&s;e for their &s;in: but now, having &s;een abun|dant proofs of my authority, and undeniable evidence of the truth, of my doctrine, and yet wilfully and ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ting to oppo&s;e it, becau&s;e incon&s;i&s;tent with their lu&s;ts; it is plain that their di&s;honouring me, is a di&s;honour done to God him&s;elf, and a direct contempt of his commands; &s;o that they are utterly inexcu&s;able. But it is no won|der, when men have given them&s;elves wholly up to be governed by worldly affections, pa&s;&s;ions, and vices, they &s;hould act contrary to all the rea&s;on and evidence in the world: for this is but the natural con&s;equence of ob&s;tinate and habitual wickedne&s;s; and hereby is only fulfilled in me, what holy Daivd long &s;ince prophetically complained of, that they hated him without a cau&s;e.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, notwith&s;tanding all the oppo&s;ition that wicked and incorrigible men will make again&s;t my doctrine, there will not be wanting powerful promoters of it, who &s;hall effectually overcome all oppo&s;ition; for the comforter, whom I &s;aid I will &s;end you from heaven, even that <HI>&s;pirit of truth,</HI> which cometh forth, and is &s;ent from the Father, &s;hall, when he cometh, with wonderful efficacy bear te&s;timony to the truth of my doctrine, and cau&s;e it to &s;pread through the world with incredible &s;ucce&s;s; nay, and ye your&s;elves al&s;o, though now &s;o weak, fearful, and doubting, &s;hall then very powerfully bear te&s;timony to the truth of all the things whereof ye have been eye-wit|ne&s;&s;es from the beginnig, having been all along pre&s;ent with me.</P>
<P>I have thus warned you beforehand, of the oppo&s;ition and per&s;ecution ye mu&s;t ex|pect to meet with in the world, that when it cometh ye may not be &s;urpri&s;ed and ter|rified &s;o as to be di&s;couraged thereby from per&s;i&s;ting in the performance of your duty. Ye mu&s;t expect particularly, that the chief prie&s;ts and rulers of the Jews, men of great hypocri&s;y and &s;uper&s;tition, zealous for their ceremonies and ritual traditions, but care|le&s;s to know and obey the will of Omnipotence in matters of great and eternal obli|gation, and invincibly prejudiced again&s;t the &s;piritual holine&s;s and purity of my doc|trine; the&s;e, I &s;ay, you mu&s;t expect will excommunicate you as apo&s;tates, and ca&s;t you out of all their &s;ocieties, as the vile&s;t of malefactors; nay, to &s;uch an ab&s;urd height of malice will their &s;uper&s;tition carry them, that they will even fancy they promote
<PB N="230" REF="029927_0240_0FE339216918DBD8">
the &s;ervice of God, and the cau&s;e of religion, when they mo&s;t barbarou&s;tly murder and de&s;troy you: but I have warned you of all this beforehand, that ye may prepare and fortify your&s;elves again&s;t it, that ye may remember I fortold it to you, and that your faith in me may thereby be &s;trengthened, when it cometh to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>INDEED, I did not tell you particularly of the&s;e things at the beginning, when you fir&s;t followed me and became my di&s;ciples, becau&s;e then I was to continue with you in per&s;on, and &s;upport you in all things by my immediate pre&s;ence: but now, being about to leave you, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint you what things are likely to come upon you after my departure, and al&s;o what comfort you may expect to &s;upport you under them, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now mention the melancholy part, namely, that I am going from you, and that great temptations will befall you in my ab&s;ence; this, indeed, ye readily apprehend, and &s;uffer your hearts to be overwhelmed with grief at the thoughts of it: but the com|fortable part of my di&s;cour&s;e, namely, that my departure is only in order to return to him that &s;ent me, and that I will &s;oon after &s;end you the Holy Spirit, and the other advantages that will thence re&s;ult to you, are neither con&s;idered nor are you &s;olicitous about them. Neverthele&s;s, if ye will li&s;ten, I will plainly tell you the truth: ye are &s;o far from having rea&s;on to be dejected at the thoughts of my departure, that on the contrary, it is really profitable and expedient for you, that I &s;hould now depart; for &s;uch is the order and di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence towards you, and the appointment of my Father's eternal and all-wi&s;e council, that before I go and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my kingdom, the comforter, which is the Holy Spirit, cannot be &s;ent unto you; but when I am departed from you, and have all power in heaven and earth committed unto me, then I will &s;end him unto you: and when he cometh he &s;hall abundantly &s;upport and comfort you under all your troubles; &s;hall powerfully plead your cau&s;e again&s;t your adver&s;aries; and &s;hall, with wonderful efficacy, cau&s;e the doctrine of the go&s;pel to &s;pread and prevail in the world again&s;t all oppo&s;ition: he &s;hall particularly, and in a mo&s;t extraordinary and convincing manner, make the world &s;en&s;ible of the greatne&s;s and heinou&s;ne&s;s of a &s;in of which they were not aware; of the righteou&s;ne&s;s and ju&s;tice of a di&s;pen&s;ation they did not under&s;tand, and of the execution of a mo&s;t re|markable judgment they did not expect. Fir&s;t, by wonderfully atte&s;ting and confirm|ing the truth of my doctrine, by the gift of tongues, and other wonderful &s;igns, he &s;hall convince the world of the greatne&s;s and heinou&s;ne&s;s of their &s;ins, in di&s;believing and rejecting me. Secondly, by demon&s;trating, that my departure out of the world, was not peri&s;hing and dying, but only a returning to my Father in order to be inve&s;ted with all power both in heaven and earth, he &s;hall convince the world of the righteou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ne&s;s and ju&s;tice of my cau&s;e, and of the excellency of that di&s;pen&s;ation which I preached and declared to mankind.

<P>MANY other things are yet hereafter to be done in relation to the &s;ettling and e&s;ta|bli&s;hing of my church, which, if it were proper, I would now acquaint you with, but ye are not yet prepared to under&s;tand and receive them. Howbeit, when the Spirit of Truth, whom I promi&s;ed you, is come, he &s;hall enlarge your under&s;tandings, remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> your prejudices, and in&s;truct you in all nece&s;&s;ary and divine truths, to enable you to go through that great work, which I have begun in per&s;on, and which I will carry o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

by your mini&s;try; for the Spirit is not to begin any new work, or to found any new doctrine of him&s;elf: but as I have taught and will teach you only in my Father's name, &s;o the Spirit &s;hall in&s;truct you only in mine and my Father's will, and in things nece&s;&s;ary to promote and carry on the &s;ame de&s;ign. Every thing that he does &s;hall be only in order to manife&s;t my glory, and e&s;tabli&s;h my religion in the world; even as every thing that I have done, has been only to manife&s;t my Father's glory, and reveal his will to mankind: for as all that I have taught is only what I received from my Father, &s;o all that the Spirit &s;hall teach you, is only what he receives from me. What|&s;oever, I &s;ay, the Spirit &s;hall teach you, is only what he receives from me; for receiv|ing from my Father, I call receiving from me, and teaching his will, is teaching mine; &s;eeing all things that the Father hath, are common to me, and all power and domi|nion is committed to me by him.</P>
<P>BE careful now to remember what matter for comfort I have given you, and &s;upport your&s;elves with it, under the approaching di&s;tre&s;s. It is now, indeed, but a very little while before I &s;hall be taken away from you; neverthele&s;s, let not this cau&s;e you to de&s;pair: for, after I am departed, it will be al&s;o but a little while before I appear to you again; ina&s;much as my being taken away from you, is not peri&s;hing, but only returning to my Father. At the&s;e la&s;t words of JESUS, the di&s;ciples were greatly di&s;|turbed and troubled, not under&s;tanding his true meaning, that in a very &s;hort time he &s;hould be taken from them by death; and that, after having overcome death by a glorious re&s;urrection, he would appear to them again before his a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven. Not under&s;tanding this, they inquired, one of another, what can he mean by telling us, that in a very little time he &s;hall be taken out of our &s;ight; and that in a very little time more, we &s;hall &s;ee him again, and this becau&s;e he goeth to the Father? The meaning of all this we cannot under&s;tand.</P>
<P>BUT JESUS ob&s;erving their perplexity, and knowing that they were de&s;irous of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king him, replied, Why are ye thus di&s;turbed and perplexed about what I told you? Is it a thing &s;o very hard to be under&s;tood, that I &s;aid, within a very little time I &s;hould be taken away from you, and that within a very little time more, I &s;hould appear to you again? Verily, verily, I tell you, I mu&s;t &s;oon depart out of this world: and when the world, who are your enemies, will rejoice and triumph over you, as if they h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d de&s;|troyed me, and wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed you; ye for your parts will be overwhelmed with grief and &s;orrow; but, within a &s;hort time, I will return to you again, and then your &s;orrow &s;hall be turned into exceeding great joy; even as a woman, when &s;he is in labour, hath great pain and &s;orrow for the pre&s;ent, but, as &s;oon &s;he is delivered forgets all her &s;ufferings, and rejoices greatly at the birth of her &s;on; &s;o ye, while ye are under the immediate apprehen&s;ion of my departure from you, and during that time of di&s;tre&s;s and temptation which &s;hall befall you in my ab&s;ence, will be full of &s;orrow and anxiety of mind; but when I ruturn to you again, then ye &s;hall rejoice with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory, and the cau&s;e of continuance of it, no power or malice of man &s;hall ever be able to take from you any more.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, though I &s;hall return to you again, and your hearts will thereupon be filled with inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, and which never &s;hall be taken from you any more; yet there will be no nece&s;&s;ity that I &s;hould then continue long with you in per&s;on, to in&s;truct you upon every occa&s;ion, as I have now done with my own mouth: for be|&s;ides that the Holy Spirit will be &s;ent to in&s;truct you in all things nece&s;&s;ary, my Fa|ther him&s;elf al&s;o will hear your petitions and be ready to grant you what&s;oever you &s;hall de&s;ire of him in my name, as being my di&s;ciples.

<P>YE &s;hall, at that time, with firm a&s;&s;urance pray to my Father in my name, for what ye want; and I need not tell you, that I will intercede with the Father on your be|half: for be&s;ides the love he has for me, and the power and authority my prayers have with him, he has moreover, of him&s;elf, a great love for you, and a ready di&s;po&s;ition to grant your prayers, becau&s;e ye are become grateful and acceptable to him, by your love towards me, which ye have &s;hewn, in embracing willingly that holy doctrine which I have revealed to you from him.</P>
<P>NOW to conclude: the &s;um of what I have told you, is briefly and plainly this: I came down from heaven from God my Father, and have lived upon earth in the &s;tate of frail and mortal man, that I might reveal to mankind the will of my heavenly Fa|ther, and the way to attain eternal life and happine&s;s: and now having fini&s;hed this great work, I am about to leave this world, and return again to my Father from whence I at fir&s;t came. The&s;e la&s;t words of JESUS, being &s;omewhat more plain and expre&s;s, than any he had before &s;poken, &s;o that now the di&s;ciples clearly perceived that the de|parture he had &s;o often mentioned, was no other than his actual going out of this world, they replied, Now, Lord thou &s;peake&s;t plainly, and without any figure; &s;o that we apprehend fully what thou means; And now that our curio&s;ity is &s;atisfied, thou ha&s;t like|wi&s;e greatly comfirmed our faith; having given us a certain token, whereby we are a&s;|&s;ured that thou knows all things, even the hearts and &s;ecret thoughts of men, &s;ince thou has an&s;wered us a que&s;tion which gave us great perplexity, and were de&s;irous to a&s;k thy opinion of, but were afraid: but now we are convinced, that thou art endued with a truly divine power and did indeed come from God. To which JESUS an&s;wered, and do you now at length firmly believe in me? Are you re&s;olved to continue &s;teadfa&s;t in this faith? Do you think your&s;elves able to per&s;evere immovably in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it? Be not confident of your own &s;trength but pray that ye may be delivered from temptation in time of di&s;tre&s;s, &s;uch as will come upon you much &s;ooner than ye expect: for I tell you, that ye will all of you within a few hours utterly for&s;ake me, and fly, in hopes to &s;ecure your&s;elves, leaving me alone; and yet I &s;hould not &s;tay alone &s;ince my Father is with me, who is more than all: I have therefore acquainted you with the&s;e things beforehand, that your minds may be furni&s;hed with &s;ufficient matter of comfort and &s;trength to bear up under all temptations, from the con&s;ideration of my having foretold both what di&s;tre&s;&s;es will befall you, and how ye &s;hall terminate your victory over all your enemies! <HI>The&s;e things I have &s;poken unto you, that in me ye might have peace.

<P>THUS having fini&s;hed his di&s;cour&s;e, JESUS lift up his eyes to heaven, and prayed, &s;aying, O Almighty Father! now the time of my &s;ufferings, for which I was &s;ent into the world, is arrived; I entreat thee &s;upport me under it, and make me triumph over death, by a

glorious re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven; that by this means the glory may re|dound to thee; and cau&s;e thy will to be believed and obeyed through all the world, to the &s;alvation of mankind; according to the full intent of that office and power with which thou did&s;t originally inve&s;t me to receive all fitly di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons into the cove|nant of &s;alvation, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t and pre&s;erve them in it unto everla&s;ting happine&s;s: the condition of this covenant is, that they firmly believe and obey thee, as the only true God, and JESUS CHRIST, as the true Me&s;&s;iah, whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent. In order to the bringing about this great de&s;ign of &s;alvation, I have declared thy will to mankind; I have publi&s;hed thy precepts, and di&s;charged the great mi&s;&s;ion entru&s;ted to me; I have preached the doctrine of repentance to &s;alvation, and have fini&s;hed the work which thou &s;ente&s;t me to do, to the glory of thy name upon earth; and now to complete the great de&s;ign, do thou, O Almighty Father! likewi&s;e glorify me with thine own &s;elf; &s;upport me under my &s;ufferings; let me prevail and triumph over death, by a glorious re&s;ur|rection, and exalt me again to the &s;ame glory in heaven which I had with thee before the creation of the univer&s;e. I have manife&s;ted thy will to my di&s;ciples, the men that thou gave&s;t me out of the world, and to all &s;uch as were fitted and di&s;po&s;ed to receive it; to &s;uch as by a pious habit, and teachable di&s;po&s;ition. were prepared to embrace whatever doctrine &s;hould appear to come from thee. To tho&s;e per&s;ons thou did&s;t in thine infinite wi&s;dom appoint, that thy truth &s;hould be made known, and not to the pre|judiced and vicious world: therefore, to them I have revealed the my&s;teries of thy kingdom, the precepts of thy go&s;pel, and the doctrine of thy &s;alvation; and this doc|trine they have willingly embraced &s;teadfa&s;tly, adhered to, and &s;incerely obeyed; as they are fully &s;atisfied and convinced, that what I taught them as from thee, was really a divine doctrine taught by thine immediate appointment and command; and that I did not preach any human invention or in&s;titution of men, but was really &s;ent by thy divine authority and commi&s;&s;ion. For the&s;e per&s;ons, therefore I now pray, that as thou ha&s;t begun the work of their &s;alvation by my preaching and revealing to them thy will, while I have been pre&s;ent with them here upon earth; &s;o al&s;o that thou woulde&s;t pre|&s;erve them when I am departed from this world, and complete the work of their &s;alva|tion by my re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven after my death. I do not pray for the unbelieving impenitent world, but for tho&s;e who have embraced that mo&s;t holy doctrine, which thou ha&s;t taught them through me by my preaching; for tho&s;e who have glorified and will glorify my name by their mini&s;try, and who con&s;equently are to be e&s;teemed as thine own, in common with me. I am now about to leave the world in order to return to thee, but the&s;e my di&s;ciples, who continue after me, I recom|mend to thy divine protection, when I am gone; endue them with powers to per&s;evere in preaching and practi&s;ing the truth, and to deliver the &s;ame holy doctrines which I have given to them, that &s;o they may remain in&s;eparably united to me, as I am to thee: &s;o long as I have been with them, in the world, I have watched over them, and kept them from falling away, both by example, preaching, and continual admoni|tion, according to the power and authority which thou did&s;t commit to me; nor has one of my apo&s;tles mi&s;carried under my care, except that per&s;idious traitor who, as the Scripture foretold, has ungratefully con&s;pired with my enemies to de&s;troy me, and will peri&s;h according to his de&s;erts. While I have continued with my di&s;ciples, I have watched over them and pre&s;erved them under mine own eye: but now, as I am going to leave the world I be&s;eech thee to keep and a&s;&s;i&s;t them by thy good Spirit; and let the expectation of their continuing under thy &s;pecial care and protection, be their comfort and &s;upport in my ab&s;ence. The world, indeed, will per&s;ecute and hate them on this account, as my doctrine is repugnant to the lu&s;ts and affections, the pa&s;&s;ions,

de&s;igns, and inclinations of worldly men; it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, that the vitious and incorrigible world will oppo&s;e and per&s;ecute them, as it has before per&s;ecuted me; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be&s;eech thee, therefore, to take them under thy particular care, to &s;upport them again&s;t the violence and oppre&s;&s;ion of an evil world: I do not de&s;ire that thou &s;houlde&s;t tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them out of the world, but pre&s;erve them in it to be in&s;truments of thy word, thy glory, and to be teachers of thy truth; nor &s;uffer them to be either de&s;troyed by the malice and violence of a perver&s;e and wicked generation, or corrupted by the evil cu&s;toms and opinions of it.</P>

Neither pray I for the&s;e my apo&s;tles only, but for all others, who &s;hall, by their preaching and practice, promote thy true religion; and being converted from the world, may, by their &s;incere endeavours, go on to reform others, convincing the world of the excellency of their religion, and con&s;equently enforcing men to acknowledge the truth and divine authority thereof: for promoting which great end, I have communicated to my apo&s;tles the &s;ame power and authority of doing mighty works for the conformation of their doctrine, and the evidence of thy truth, as thou did&s;t communicate to me; that &s;o I working in them as thou ha&s;t done in me, and thus confirming with g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat efficacy and demon&s;tration of Spirit, they may e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame doctrine which I pub|li&s;hed in per&s;on, that the world may, by this evidence, be convinced that I was really &s;ent by thee, and that my di&s;ciples act by the &s;ame divine commi&s;&s;ion as I did.</P>
<P>ALMIGHTY and Holy Father, all tho&s;e whom thou ha&s;t thus given me, who have wi&s;ely embraced my doctrine, and &s;incerely obeyed it, I de&s;ire that thou woulde&s;t make them partakers of the &s;ame happine&s;s with my&s;elf, and exalt them to behold the incom|prehen&s;ible glory wherewith thou did&s;t originally inve&s;t me in thy eternal love, before the foundation of the world.

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CHRIST's</HI> Agony and Prayer in the Garden of Gath&s;emane: Judas betrayeth <HI>JESUS</HI> with a Ki&s;s: The Officers and Soldiers, at <HI>CHRIST's</HI> Word, fall to the Ground: <HI>CHRIST</HI> healeth a Servant of the High-Prie&s;t, who&s;e Ear was cut off by Peter: His Di&s;ciples flee: He is led bound to Annas and Caiaphas.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE prayer of our great Interce&s;&s;or being ended, he, with his di&s;ciples, came down from the Mount of Olives into the field below, called Gath&s;emane, through which the brook Cedron ran, and in it, on the other &s;ide of the brook, was a garden, called the garden of Geth&s;emane. Here he de&s;ired his di&s;ciples to &s;it down, perhaps at the garden-door within, till he &s;hould retire to pray, taking with him, Peter, James, and John, tho&s;e three &s;elect di&s;ciples whom he had before cho&s;en to be witne&s;&s;es of his transfiguration, and now to be eye-witne&s;&s;es of his pa&s;&s;ion, leaving the other di&s;ciples it the garden-door, to watch the approach of Judas and his band. The &s;ufferings he was on the point of undergoing were &s;o great, that the very pro&s;pect of them terrified him, and made him expre&s;s him&s;elf in this doleful exclamation, <HI>My &s;oul is exceeding &s;orrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</HI> On this great occa&s;ion he &s;u&s;|tained tho&s;e grievous &s;orrows in his &s;oul, by which, as well as by dying on the cro&s;s, he became a &s;in-offering, and accompli&s;hed the redemption of mankind, He now with|drew from about a &s;tone's ca&s;t, and his human nature being now overburdened beyond mea&s;ure he found it nece&s;&s;ary to retire and pray, that if it was po&s;&s;ible, or con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;alvation of the world, he might be delivered from the &s;ufferings which were then lying on him: it was not the fear of dying on the cro&s;s which made him &s;peak or pray in &s;uch a manner: to &s;uppo&s;e this, would infinitly degrade his character make his &s;ufferings as terrible as po&s;&s;ible, and clothe them with all the aggravating circum|&s;tance of di&s;tre&s;s: yet the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, who&s;e human nature was &s;trengthened by being connected with the divine, could not &s;hrink at the pro&s;pect of &s;ufferings, or betray a weakne&s;s which many of his followers, who, though mere men, were &s;trangers to; having encountered more terrible deaths without the lea&s;t emotions. He addre&s;&s;es his Divine Father with a &s;igh of fervent wi&s;hes, that the cup might if po&s;&s;ible, be removed from him: in the Greek, it is, 'O that thou would&s;t remove this cup from me.' And having fir&s;t kneeled and prayed, he fell pro&s;trate on his face, accompany|ing his addre&s;s with due expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;ignation, adding immediately, <HI>Neverthele&s;s, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</HI> Having prayed, he returned to his di&s;ciples, and finding them a&s;leep, he &s;aid to Peter. <HI>Simon, &s;leepe&s;t thou? Coulde&s;t not thou watch one hour?</HI> Can&s;t thou &s;o &s;oon forget thy Ma&s;ter? Thou who &s;o lately boa&s;ted of thy courage and con&s;tancy in my &s;ervice.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, in his greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, he never lo&s;t &s;ight of that kind concern he had for his di&s;ciples: <HI>Watch ye,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>and pray, le&s;t ye enter into temptation.</HI> Neither was he on tho&s;e extraordinary occa&s;ions, in the lea&s;t moved with the offences which they had committed through frailty and human weakne&s;s: on the contrary, was always willing to make excu&s;es for them; alledging in their defence, <HI>that the &s;pirit truly was ready, but the fle&s;h was weak.</HI> It &s;eems from the&s;e particulars, that he &s;pent &s;ome con|&s;iderable time in his addre&s;&s;es, becau&s;e the di&s;ciples fell a&s;leep in his ab&s;ence, and he him&s;elf retired again to pray; for the &s;orrows of our Lord continuing to increa&s;e up|on him, affected him to &s;uch a degree, that he retired a &s;econd time, and prayed to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, &s;aying, <HI>O my Father, if this cup may not pa&s;s away from me, except I

And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, &s;trengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed more earne&s;tly; and his &s;weat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</HI> Thus did he &s;uffer un&s;peakable &s;orrows in his &s;oul, as long as the Divine wi&s;don thought proper. At length he obtained relief, being heard on account of his perfect and entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of his heavenly Father: <HI>And when he ro&s;e up from prayer, and was come to his di&s;ciples, be found them &s;leeping for &s;orrow.</HI> This circum&s;tance &s;hews how much the di&s;ciples were affected with their Ma&s;ter's &s;ufferings: the &s;en&s;ations of grief which they felt on &s;eeing his un&s;peakable di&s;tre&s;s, &s;o overpowered them, that they &s;unk into &s;leep. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour for the la&s;t time came to his di&s;ciples, and &s;eeing them a&s;leep, he &s;aid, <HI>Sleep on now, and take your re&s;t: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of &s;in|ners. Ri&s;e let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</HI></P>
<P>THE owner of the garden, it &s;eems where he now was, had been our Lord's ac|quaintance, perhaps his di&s;ciple, who believing on him, con&s;idered him&s;elf as highly honoured in JESUS's frequenting it, for the &s;ake of retirement or devotion, and, there|fore, had given him the free u&s;e of it whenever he plea&s;ed. We are told that Judas knew the place; for <HI>Je&s;us oftimes re&s;orted thither, with his di&s;ciples.</HI> The chief prie&s;ts and elders being informed by Judas, that the proper time for apprehending JESUS was now come, &s;ent a band of &s;oldiers with him, and &s;ervants carrying lanterns and torches, to &s;hew them the way; becau&s;e, though it was always full moon at the po&s;&s;over, the &s;ky might be dark with clouds, and the place wither they were going was &s;haded with trees: at the &s;ame time, a deputation of their number accompanied the band, to &s;ee that every one did his duty. Judas having thus received a band of men and officers from the chief prie&s;ts and Phari&s;ees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches, and weapons; for they were exceeding anxious to &s;ecure and get him into their hands, and the &s;oldiers having perhaps never &s;een JESUS before, found it nece&s;&s;ary that Judas &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h him, and point him out to them by &s;ome particular &s;ign. St. Luke &s;eems to &s;ay, that Judas went before them at a little di&s;tance, to prepare them for the readier execution of their office, by ki&s;&s;ing his Ma&s;ter, the token they had agreed up|on, that they might not mi&s;take him and &s;eize a wrong per&s;on: <HI>And he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Je&s;us to ki&s;s him.</HI> Nor can the account which St. John has given us, be under&s;tood on any other &s;uppo&s;ition, who &s;ays, that after Judas was come up with the &s;oldiers, JESUS went out of the garden, and a&s;ked them, who it was they were &s;eeking? To which they replied <HI>Je&s;us of Nazareth.</HI> It therefore follows, that they were at a lo&s;s to know him, which they could not have been, had they &s;een Judas ki&s;s him: the ki&s;s, therefore, mu&s;t have been given in the garden before the band came up; nor is their agreement about the &s;ign incon&s;i&s;tent with this &s;uppo&s;ition; becau&s;e that confu&s;ion which commonly attends the commi&s;&s;ion

He went before the &s;oldiers, on pretence that he would lead them to the place, and &s;hew them the man by ki&s;&s;ing him: however, to conceal his villainy from his Ma&s;ter and the di&s;ciples, he walked ha&s;tily, and without waiting for the band, went up directly and &s;aluted him; feigning, perhaps, to apprize him of his danger. But JESUS did not fail to convince him that he knew the meaning and intent of his &s;alutation, &s;aying, <HI>Betraye&s;t thou the Son of man with a ki&s;s?</HI> Judas certainly concealed his treachery &s;o well, that Peter did not &s;u&s;pect him, as it is probable, he would have &s;truck at him rather than at Malchus, the high-prie&s;t's &s;ervant, if he had.</P>
<P>OUR Lord's appointed time for &s;uffering being now come, he did not, as formerly, avoid his enemies; but, on the contrary, on their telling him they faught JESUS of Naza|reth, he replied, <HI>I am he:</HI> thereby in&s;inuating to them, that he was willing to put him&s;elf into their hands: at the &s;ame time to &s;hew them that they could not apprehend him without this own con&s;ent, he in an extraordinary manner, exerted his divine power, he made the whole band fall back, and threw them to the ground: <HI>Je&s;us, therefore, knowing all things that &s;hould come upon him, went forth, and &s;aid unto them, Whom &s;eek ye? They an&s;wered him, Je&s;us of Nazareth. Je&s;us &s;aith unto them, I am he. And Judas al&s;o, which betrayed him, &s;tood with them. As &s;oon then as he had &s;aid unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</HI> But the &s;oldiers and the Jews imagining, perhaps, that they had been thrown down by &s;ome daemon or evil &s;pirit, with whom the Jews &s;aid he was in confederacy, advanced towards him a &s;econd time: <HI>Then a&s;ked he them again, Whom &s;eek ye? And they &s;aid, Je&s;us of Nazareth. Je&s;us an&s;wered, I have told you, that I am he;</HI> expre&s;&s;ing again his willingne&s;s to fall into their hands: <HI>If therefore ye &s;eek me, let the&s;e go their way.</HI> If your bu&s;ine&s;s be with me alone, &s;uffer my di&s;ciples to pa&s;s: for the party had &s;urrounded them al&s;o.

<P>SOME of the &s;oldiers, more daring than the re&s;t, at length rudely caught JESUS, and bound him: upon which Peter drew his &s;word, and &s;mote off the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar of the high-prie&s;t's &s;ervant, who probably was &s;hewing greater forwardne&s;s than the re&s;t in this bu&s;ine&s;s: <HI>Then Simon Peter, having a &s;word, drew it, and &s;mote the high-prie&s;t's &s;ervant, and cut of his right ear; the &s;ervant's name was Malchus.</HI> The enraged apo&s;tle was on the point of &s;ingly attacking the whole band, when JESUS ordered him to &s;heath his &s;word, telling him, that his un&s;ea&s;onable and imprudent defence might prove the oc|ca&s;ion of his de&s;truction: <HI>Then &s;aid Je&s;us unto him, put up again thy &s;word into its place; for all they that take the &s;word, &s;hall peri&s;h with the &s;word.</HI> He told him likewi&s;e, that it implied both a di&s;tru&s;t of the Divine Providence, which can always employ a variety of means for the &s;afety of good men, and al&s;o his ignorance in the Scriptures: <HI>Thinke&s;t thou,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he &s;hall pre&s;ently give me more than twelve legions of angels?

<P>LEGION was a Roman military term, being the name which they gave to a body of five or &s;ix thou&s;and men: wherefore, in regard that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> band which now &s;urrounded them, was a Roman cohort, our Lord might make u&s;e of this term by way of contra&s;t, to &s;hew what an incon&s;iderable thing the cohort was, in compari&s;on of the force he

could &s;ummon to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; more than twelve legions, not of &s;oldiers, but of an|gels. He yet was tenderly inclined to prevent any bad con&s;equences, which might have flowed from Peter's ra&s;hne&s;s, by healing the &s;ervant, and adding, in his rebuke to him, a declaration of his willingne&s;s to &s;uffer: <HI>The cup which my Father has given me, &s;hall I not drink it?</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord's healing the ear of Malchus, by touching it, &s;eems to imply, that he created a new one in the place of that which was cut off; but though he performed the cure &s;ome other way, it equally demon&s;trates both his goodne&s;s and his power. No wound or di&s;temper was incurable in the hand of JESUS; neither was any injury &s;o great that he could not forgive. It &s;eems &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ing that this evident miracle did not make an impre&s;&s;ion upon the chief prie&s;ts, e&s;pecially as our Lord put them in mind, at the &s;ame time, of his other miracles; for having fir&s;t &s;aid, <HI>Suffer ye thus far; and he touched his ear, and healed him;</HI> he added, <HI>Be ye come out, as again&s;t a thief, with &s;words and &s;taves? When I was daily with you in the temple, ye &s;tretched forth no hands again&s;t me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkne&s;s.</HI> Luke xxii.51, 52, 53. They had kept at a di&s;tance during the attack, but drew near, when they under&s;tood that JESUS, was in their power; for they were proof again&s;t all conviction, being ob&s;tinately bent on putting him to death. And the di&s;ciples, when they &s;aw their Ma&s;ter in the hands of his enemies, for&s;ook him and fled, according to his prediction; notwith&s;tanding they might have followed him without any danger, as the prie&s;ts had no de&s;ign again&s;t them: <HI>Then all the di&s;ciples for&s;ook him, and fled. Then the band, and the captain and officers of the Jews, took Je&s;us, and bound him.</HI> But it was not the cord which held him; his immen&s;e charity was by far a &s;tronger band: he could, with more ea&s;e than Samp&s;on, have broken tho&s;e weak ties, and exerted his divinity in a more wonderful manner; he could have &s;tricken them all dead, with as much ea&s;e as he had before thrown them on the ground: but he patiently &s;ubmitted to this, as to every other indignity which they plea&s;ed to offer him; &s;o meek was he under the greate&s;t injuries. Having thus &s;ecu|red him, they led him away: <HI>And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth ca&s;t about his naked body; and the young man laid hold on him: and he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</HI> This, perhaps, was the proprietor of the garden; who, being awakened with the noi&s;e, came out with the linen cloth, in which he had been lying, ca&s;t around his naked body; and forgetting the dre&s;s he was in, and having a re&s;pect for JESUS, followed him.</P>
<P>HE was fir&s;t led to Annas, father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high-prie&s;t that year. Annas having him&s;elf di&s;charged the office of high-prie&s;t, was con&s;equently a per&s;on of di&s;tingui&s;hed character, which, together with his relation to the high-prie&s;t, made him worthy of the re&s;pect they now paid him: but he refu&s;ed &s;ingly to meddle in the affair; they, therefore, carried JESUS to Caiaphas him&s;elf, at who&s;e palace the chief prie&s;ts, elders, and Scribes were a&s;&s;embled, having &s;taid there all night to &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of their &s;tratagem. This Caiaphas was he that advi&s;ed the council to put JESUS to death, even admitting he was innocent, for the &s;afety of the whole Jewi&s;h nation. He was advanced to the &s;acerdotal dignity by Valerius Gratus, Pilate's predece&s;&s;or, and was dive&s;ted of it by Vitellius, governor of Syria, after he had depo&s;ed Pilate from his pro|curator&s;hip; and therefore &s;eems to have enjoyed it during the whole cour&s;e of Pilate's government.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Peter thrice denies his having any Knowledge of <HI>JESUS</HI>; but on his <HI>LORD's</HI> turning and looking on him, he repenteth.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE trial of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord in the high-prie&s;t's palace, and Peter's denying him, being co-temporary events, might be repeated by the evangelical hi&s;torians accor|ding to their plea&s;ure. The evangeli&s;ts Matthew and Mark de&s;cribe the trial fir&s;t, as it is the principal fact; but Luke after the denials of Peter. John has pre&s;erved the natural order here; for he begins with the fir&s;t denial, becau&s;e it happened immediately after Peter entered the palace, then gives the hi&s;tory of the trial as the principal fact, con|cluding with the &s;ub&s;equent denials. But though this be the natural order, we &s;hall view the denials together, previous to the trial, in order to form a better idea of them.</P>
<P>WHEN JESUS was apprehended, the apo&s;tles, in great con&s;ternation, for&s;ook him, and fled, according to the prediction concerning them: &s;ome of them, however, recovering out of the panic that had &s;eized them, followed the band at a di&s;tance, to &s;ee what the i&s;&s;ue would be. Of this number was Peter, and another di&s;ciple, whom John has men|tioned, without giving his name, and who, therefore, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been John him&s;elf. This di&s;ciple being acquainted at the high-prie&s;t's, got admittance for him&s;elf fir&s;t, and &s;oon after for Peter, who had come with him: <HI>And Simon Peter followed Je&s;us, and &s;o did another di&s;ciple: that di&s;ciple was known unto the high-prie&s;t, and went in with Je&s;us into the palace of the high-prie&s;t. But Peter &s;tood at the door without. Then went out that other di&s;ciple, and &s;pake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter. And when they had kindled a fire in the mid&s;t of the hall, and were &s;et down together, Peter &s;at down among them.</HI> The maid &s;ervant who kept the door concluding Peter to be a di&s;ciple al&s;o, followed after him to the fire, and looking earne&s;tly at him, charged him with the &s;uppo&s;ed crime: <HI>Then &s;aith the dam&s;el that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou al&s;o one of this man's di&s;ciples?</HI> This blunt attack threw Peter into &s;uch confu&s;ion, that he flatly denied his having any connection with JESUS, replying, <HI>I am not,</HI> and ad|ding, <HI>I know not, neither under&s;tand I what thou &s;aye&s;t.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, I do not un|der&s;tand there is any rea&s;on for your a&s;king me &s;uch a que&s;tion. Thus, the very apo&s;tle who had before acknowledged his Ma&s;ter to be the Me&s;&s;iah, the Son of the Living God, who was honoured with the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and had &s;o confidently boa&s;ted of fortitude, and firm attachment to him in the greate&s;t dangers, proved an arrent de&s;erter of his cau&s;e upon trial. His &s;hameful fears were altogether inexcu&s;able, as the enemy who attacked him was one of the weaker &s;ex, and the terror of the charge was, in a great mea&s;ure, taken off by the in&s;inuation made in it, that John was likewi&s;e known to be CHRIST's di&s;ciple; for, as he was known at the high-prie&s;t's, he was con&s;equently known in that character: <HI>Art thou not al&s;o one of this man's di&s;ci|ples?</HI> Art thou not one of them as well as he who is &s;itting with you? Equivocation, mental re&s;ervation, and &s;uch like ba&s;e arts, are below the dignity and courage of rea&s;onable creatures; but downright lying, and that in the pre&s;ence of John his fellow-di&s;ciple, is abominable, and can only be accounted for, by the confu&s;ion and panic which had &s;eized him on this occa&s;ion. As Peter's inward perturbation mu&s;t have appeared in his countenance and ge&s;ture, he did not choo&s;e to &s;tay long with the &s;ervants at the fire; he went out, therefore, into the porch, where he was a little con|cealed: <HI>And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew,</HI> namely, for the fir&s;t time. <HI>And

the maid &s;aw him again, and began to &s;ay to them that &s;tood by, This is one of them; and he again denied it with an oath, I know not the man:</HI> thus aggravating his former crime by that of perjury.</P>
<P>PETER having been thus attacked without doors, thought proper to return and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> with the crowd at the fire: <HI>And Simon Peter &s;tood and warmed him&s;elf.</HI> From this cir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cum&s;tance, we may conclude, that the en&s;uing was the third denial; and that Peter le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the porch where the &s;econd denial happened, and was come again into the hall: <HI>Here one of the &s;ervants of the high-prie&s;t, being his kind&s;man who&s;e ear Peter cut off, &s;aith, Did n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> I &s;ee thee in the garden with him?

Surely, thou art one of them, for thou art a Galilean, and thy &s;peech agreeth thereto; &s;o that, being pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, to give his lie the better colour, he profane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the name of God, by imprecating the bittere&s;t cur&s;es on him&s;elf, if he was telling a fal&s;ehood: perhaps, he hoped, by the&s;e acts of impiety, to convince them effectually that he was not CHRIST's di&s;ciple.</P>
<P>THIS zealous apo&s;tle thus denied his Ma&s;ter three di&s;tinct times, with oaths and a&s;&s;e|verations, totally forgetting the vehement prote&s;tations he had made a few hours before, that he would never deny him. He was permitted to fall in this manner, to teach u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> two le&s;&s;ons: fir&s;t, that whatever a per&s;on's attainments might have been formerly, if once he pa&s;&s;es the bounds of innocence, he commonly proceeds from bad to wor&s;e, one &s;in naturally draws on another; for which rea&s;on, the very lea&s;t appearances of evil are to be avoided, and the greate&s;t humility and &s;elf-diffidence maintained: in the &s;econd place, we may learn, that no &s;inner who repents, and has confidence in the goodne&s;s of God, &s;hould ever de&s;pair; for he no &s;ooner denied his Ma&s;ter the third time, than the cock crew, and awakened in him the fir&s;t conviction of his &s;in: <HI>And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembred the word of the Lord, how he had &s;aid unto him, Before the cock crow, thou &s;halt deny me thrice. And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</HI> St. Luke is the only evangeli&s;t who has pre&s;erved this beautiful circum&s;tance of CHRIST's turning and looking on Peter. The members of the council who &s;at on JESUS, were placed at the upper end of the hall; in the other, were the &s;ervants with Peter at the fire: &s;o that JESUS being probably placed on &s;ome eminence, that his judges, who were numerous, might &s;ee and hear him, could ea&s;ily look over towards Peter, and ob&s;erve him denying him, and in pa&s;&s;ionate terms, loud enough to be heard, perhaps, over all the place. The look pierced him, and, with the crowing of the cock, brought his Ma&s;ter's prediction fre&s;h into his mind. He was &s;tung with deep remor&s;e; and, being unable to contain him&s;elf, he covered his face with his garment to conceal the con|fu&s;ion he was in, and going out into the porch wept very bitterly. All this pa&s;&s;ed while the prie&s;ts examined JESUS with many taunts and revilings; and while the mo&s;t zealous of CHRIST's di&s;ciples was denying him with oaths and imprecations, the others in&s;ulted him in the mo&s;t inhuman manner. Thus a complication of injuries, in&s;ults, and indignities, was at one time heaped upon the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, the meek and mild JESUS, the &s;uffering and wonderfully patient Son of the adorable Maje&s;ty of heaven.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Trial of <HI>JESUS</HI> before the Sanhedrim, or grand Council of the Jews.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE band of &s;oldiers having &s;eized JESUS, led him to the high-prie&s;t's hou&s;e, where all the chief prie&s;ts, the Scribes, and the elders were a&s;&s;embled: <HI>And as &s;oon as it was day, the elders of the people, and the chief prie&s;ts, and the Scribes, came together, and led him into their council.</HI> Probably the trial did not begin immediately on our Lord's arri|val; for though many of the judges were at the high-prie&s;t's before him, &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tinction might be ab&s;ent, who&s;e coming, the re&s;t were, out of re&s;pect, inclined to wait for: but, as the pa&s;&s;over was at hand, they had no time to lo&s;e; &s;o that as &s;oon as the council was fully met, the trial was begun: <HI>And the high-prie&s;t a&s;ked Je&s;us of his di&s;ciples, and of his doctrine.</HI> He enquired of him what his di&s;ciples were, for what end he had gathered them, whether it was to make him&s;elf a king, and what the doctrine was which he taught them? In the&s;e que&s;tions there was a great deal of art; for as the crime laid to our Saviour's charge was, that he had &s;et up for the Me&s;&s;iah, and deluded the people, they expected he would claim that dignity in their pre&s;ence, and &s;o would, on his own confe&s;&s;ion have condemned him, without any further proce&s;s. This was unfair, as it was artful and en&s;naring: to oblige a pri&s;oner on his trial to confe&s;s what might take away his life, was a very inequitable method of proceeding; and JESUS expre&s;&s;ed his opinion thereof with very good rea&s;on, and complained of it, bidding them prove what they had laid to his charge by witne&s;&s;es: <HI>Je&s;us an&s;wered him, I &s;pake openly to the world; I ever taught in the &s;ynagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always re&s;ort; and in &s;ecret have I &s;aid nothing. Why a&s;ke&s;t thou me? A&s;k them which heard me, what I have &s;aid unto them: behold they know what I &s;aid.</HI> It was greatly to the honour of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, that all his actions were done in public, under the eye even of his enemies; becau&s;e, had he been carrying on any impo&s;ture, the lovers of good|ne&s;s and truth had thus abundant opportunities of detecting him with propriety: he therefore, in his defence, appealed to that part of his character; yet his an&s;wer was con&s;trued di&s;re&s;pectful: for, <HI>when he had thus &s;poken, one of the officers which &s;tood by, &s;truck Je&s;us with the palm of his hand, &s;aying, An&s;were&s;t thou the high-prie&s;t &s;o?</HI> To which he meekly replied with the greate&s;t &s;erenity. <HI>If I have &s;poken evil, bear witne&s;s of the evil: but if well, why &s;mite&s;t thou me?</HI> Shew me, prove before this court, wherein my crime con&s;i&s;ts, or record it in the evidence on the face of my trial; which if thou cannot, how can thou an&s;wer this inhuman treatment to a defencele&s;s pri&s;oner, &s;tanding on his trial before the world, and in open court, and &s;trike me unde&s;ervedly?</P>
<P>IN this in&s;tance JESUS became an example of his own precept; and if a man &s;mite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other al&s;o. Matt. v.39. bearing the greate&s;t injuries with an unprovoked patience, worthy of the meek Lamb of God.</P>
<P>JESUS having declined an&s;wering the que&s;tions, whereby the council expected to have drawn from him an anknowledgment of his being the Me&s;&s;iah, they proceeded to exa|mine many witne&s;&s;es to prove his having a&s;&s;umed that character; as they con&s;idered &s;uch a preten&s;ion as bla&s;phemy in his mouth, who being only a man, according to their opinion, could not, without the highe&s;t affront to the Divine Maje&s;ty, pretend to the title of the Son of God, as it belonged only to the Me&s;&s;iah.

<P>OUR Saviour, during the whole time, made no reply to the evidences that were pro|duced again&s;t him, which greatly provoked the high-prie&s;t, who, &s;uppo&s;ing that he in|tended by his &s;ilence, to put an affront on true council, ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and with great perturbation, demanded the rea&s;on for &s;o remarkable a conduct: An&s;were&s;t thou nothing, &s;aid he, what is it which the&s;e witne&s;s again&s;t thee?

<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS was not, however, intimidated by the con&s;equence attending his con|confe&s;&s;ion of the truth; for being adjured by the chief magi&s;trate, he immediately con|fe&s;&s;ed the charge, adding, ye &s;hall &s;hortly &s;ee a convincing evidence of this truth, in that wonderful and unparalleled de&s;truction which I will &s;end upon the Jewi&s;h nation; in the quick and powerful progre&s;s which the go&s;pel &s;hall make over the earth; and finally, in my glorious appearance in the clouds of heaven at the la&s;t day, the &s;ign you have &s;o often demanded in confirmation of my being &s;ent from God.</P>

<P>THE high-prie&s;t, on hearing this &s;econd a&s;&s;ertion, rent his cloths with great indignation, and &s;aid unto the council, Why need we trouble our&s;elves to &s;eek for any more witne&s;&s;es?

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>JESUS</HI> is led before Pilate: Judas relents, carries back the Money, and hangs him&s;elf: The Go|vernor refu&s;es to judge our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, declares him innocent, and &s;ends him to Herod; who, after hearing his Accu&s;ers, &s;ends him back again.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Saviour of the world, whom the whole Jewi&s;h nation had &s;o long expected, having been thus condemned by the Sanhedrim, they con&s;ulted together, and re|&s;olved to carry him before the governor, that he might likewi&s;e pa&s;s &s;entence on him. The Roman governors of Judea, generally re&s;ided at Cae&s;area; but at the great fea&s;ts they came up to Jeru&s;alem to prevent or &s;uppre&s;s tumults, and to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice: it being a cu&s;tom for the Roman governors of provinces to vi&s;it the principal towns under their juri&s;diction on this latter account. Pilate, being accordingly come to Jeru&s;alem &s;ome time before the fea&s;t, had been informed, probably by Jo&s;eph of Arimathea, of the great ferment among&s;t the rulers, and the true character of the per&s;on on who&s;e account it was rai&s;ed; for he entertained a ju&s;t notion of it: <HI>he knew that for envy they had deli|vered him.</HI> He knew the cau&s;e of their envy, was impre&s;&s;ed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> favourable opinion of JESUS, and wi&s;hed, if po&s;&s;ible, to deliver him from his vile per&s;ecutors, who &s;ought to put him to death.</P>
<P>THE Jewi&s;h council early in the morning, brought JESUS to the hall of judgment, or governor's palace. They them&s;elves, however, went not into the hall, but &s;tood with|out, le&s;t they &s;hould be rendered incapable of eating the pa&s;&s;over, by being defiled.</P>
<P>JUDAS I&s;cariot, who had delivered his Ma&s;ter into the hands of the council, finding his project turned out very different from what he expected, was filled with the deepe&s;t remor&s;e for what he had done. He &s;aw all his golden dreams of temporal honours and advantages, &s;unk at once to nothing; he &s;aw his kind, his indulgent Ma&s;ter condemned, and for&s;aken by all his followers. He &s;aw all this, and determined to make all the &s;atisfaction in his power for the crime he had committed: accordingly, he came and confe&s;&s;ed openly his &s;in before the chief prie&s;ts and elders, offered them the money they had given him to commit it, and earne&s;tly wi&s;hed he could recal the fatal tran&s;action of the preceding night. It &s;eems he thought this was the mo&s;t public te&s;timony he could po&s;&s;ibly give of his Ma&s;ter's innocence, and his own repentance: I have, &s;aid he, com|mitted a mo&s;t horrid crime, in betraying an innocent man to death. But this moving

&s;peech of Judas had no effect on the callous hearts of the Jewi&s;h rulers: they affirmed, that however they might think the pri&s;oner innocent, and for that rea&s;on had &s;inned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bringing the &s;entence of death upon his head, they were not to blame; becau&s;e th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> knew him a bla&s;phemer, who de&s;erved to die: <HI>What is that to us?</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>&s;ee th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that.</HI> Nay, they even refu&s;ed to take back the money they had given him as a re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> for performing the ba&s;e act of betraying his Ma&s;ter, who had de&s;erved from him the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of treatment.</P>

<P>WE have before remarked, that the chief prie&s;ts and elders refu&s;ed to go them&s;elve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> into the judgment-hall, le&s;t they &s;hould contract &s;ome pollutions in the hou&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Heathen, which would have rendered them unfit for eating the pa&s;&s;over.

tribunal. By this contrivance, the people might &s;tand round the tribunal in the open air, hear and &s;ee the governor when he &s;pake to them from the pavement, and ob|&s;erve the whole admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, without danger of being defiled either by him or any of his attendants.</P>
<P>THE great Redeemer of mankind was brought before this tribunal: and the prie&s;t and elders having taken their places around the pavement, the governor a&s;cended the judgment-&s;eat, and a&s;ked them what accu&s;ation they brought again&s;t the pri&s;oner? Though nothing could be more natural than for the governor to a&s;k this que&s;tion, yet the Jews thought them&s;elves highly affronted by it. They probably knew his &s;enti|ments concerning the pri&s;oner, and therefore con&s;idered his que&s;tion as intended to in&s;inuate, that they brought one to be condemned, again&s;t whom they could find no accu&s;ation. Pilate might indeed &s;peak to them in a &s;tern manner, and by that means &s;ufficiently indicate his di&s;plea&s;ure: but, however that be, the Jews haughtily an&s;wered, if he had not been a very great and extraordinary malefactor, we &s;hould not have given thee this trouble at all, much le&s;s at &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable an hour as the per&s;ent.</P>
<P>JESUS was then examined by Pilate, who finding he had not been guilty either of rebellion or &s;edition, but that he was accu&s;ed of particulars relating to the religion and cu&s;toms of the Jews, grew angry, and &s;aid, what are the&s;e things to me? Take him your&s;elves, and judge him according to your own law; plainly in&s;inuating, that in his opinion, the crime they laid to the pri&s;oner's charge was not of a capital na|ture; and that &s;uch puni&s;hments as they were permitted by Cae&s;ar to inflict, were ade|quate to any mi&s;demeanor that JESUS was charged with. But this propo&s;al of the Ro|man governor was ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed by the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts and elders, becau&s;e it con|demned their whole proceeding, and therefore they an&s;wered, We have no power to put any one to death, as this man certainly de&s;erves, who has attempted not only to make innovations in our religion, but al&s;o &s;et up him&s;elf for a king. This eagerne&s;s of the Jews to get JESUS condemned by the Roman governor, who often &s;entenced malefactors to be crucified, tended to fulfil the &s;ayings of our great Redeemer, who, during the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try, has often mentioned what kind of death he was ap|pointed to die by the pre-determination of the Omni&s;cient God.</P>
<P>AS Pilate now found it impo&s;&s;ible to prevent a tumult, unle&s;s he proceeded to try JESUS, he therefore a&s;cended again the judgment-&s;eat, and commanded his accu&s;ers to produce their charges again&s;t him. Accordingly, they accu&s;ed him of &s;editious prac|tices, affirming that he had u&s;ed every method in his power to di&s;&s;uade the people from paying taxes to Cae&s;ar, pretending that he him&s;elf was the Me&s;&s;iah, the great king of the Jews, &s;o long expected: but they brought no proof of this a&s;&s;ertion. They only in&s;inuated that they had already convicted him of this crime; which was ab&s;o|lutely fal&s;e. Pilate, however, a&s;ked him, Is it true, what the&s;e men lay to thy charge, that thou ha&s;t indeed attempted to &s;et up thy&s;elf as king of the Jews? To which JESUS replied, ha&s;t thou ever during thy &s;tay in this province, heard any thing of me, that gave thee any rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect me guilty of &s;ecret practices and &s;editious de&s;igns again&s;t the government? Or do&s;t thou found thy que&s;tion only on the pre&s;ent clamour and tumult that is rai&s;ed again&s;t me? If this be the ca&s;e, be very careful le&s;t thou be im|po&s;ed on merely by the ambiguity of a word: for, to be King of the Jews, is not to erect a temporal throne in oppo&s;ition to that of Cae&s;ar, but &s;omething very different from it; the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah is of a &s;piritual nature.</P>
<P>PILATE replied, am I a Jew? Can I tell what their expectations are, and in what &s;uper&s;titious &s;en&s;e they under&s;tand the&s;e words? The rulers and chiefs of their own

people, we are the mo&s;t proper judges of the&s;e particulars, have brought thee before me, as a riotous and &s;editious per&s;on; if this be not the truth, let me know what is, and the crime thou ha&s;t been guilty of, and what they lay to thy charge.</P>
<P>TO which JESUS an&s;wered, I have indeed a kingdom, and this kingdom I have pro|fe&s;&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h; but then it is not of this world, nor have my endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h it any tendency to cau&s;e di&s;turbances in the government: for, had that been the ca&s;e, my &s;ervants would have fought for me, and not &s;uffered me to have fallen into the hands of the Jews: but I tell thee plainly, my kingdom is wholly &s;piritual, con&s;i&s;ting only in the obedience of the wills and affections of men to the laws of God.</P>
<P>PILATE &s;aid, Thou acknowledges then in general, that thou ha&s;t pretended to be a king? To which the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS replied, In the &s;en&s;e I have told thee, I have declared, and do now declare my&s;elf to be a king: for this very end I was born, and for this pur|po&s;e I came into the world, that I &s;hould bear witne&s;s to the truth; and who&s;oever &s;in|cerely loves, and is always ready to embrace the truth, will hear my te&s;timony and be convinced by it. Pilate &s;aid, <HI>What is truth?</HI> and immediately went out to the Jews, and &s;aid unto them, I have again examined this man, but can find him guilty of no fault, which, according to the Roman law, de&s;erves to have the puni&s;hment of death in|flicted for it.</P>
<P>THOUGH the governor made this generous declaration of the innocence of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, it had no effect on the &s;uper&s;titious and bigoted Jews: they even per&s;i&s;ted in their accu&s;ations with more vehemence than before, affirming that he had attempted to rai&s;e a &s;edition in Galilee: <HI>He &s;tirred up,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>the people, beginning from Galilee to this place.</HI> JESUS, however, made no an&s;wer at all to this heavy charge: nay, he continued &s;ilent, notwith&s;tanding the governor him&s;elf expre&s;sly required him to &s;peak in his own defence. A conduct &s;o extraordinary, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, a&s;toni&s;hed Pilate exceed|ingly; for he had great rea&s;on to be per&s;uaded of the innocence of our dear Redeemer. The truth is, he was altogether ignorant of the divine council by which the whole affair was directed, and the end propo&s;ed by it.</P>
<P>MANY rea&s;ons induced the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS not to make a public defence. He came into the world purely to redeem lo&s;t and undone mankind, by offering up him&s;elf a &s;acrifice to appea&s;e the wrath of his Almighty Father: but had he pleaded with his u&s;ual force, the people had, in all probability, been induced to a&s;k his relea&s;e, and con&s;e|quently his death had been prevented: be&s;ides, the gro&s;s fal&s;ehood of the accu&s;ation, known to all the inhabitants of Galilee, rendered any reply ab&s;olutely unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE chief prie&s;ts continued, in the mean time, to accu&s;e him with great noi&s;e and tumult: and the meek and humble JESUS &s;till continuing mute, Pilate &s;pake again to him, &s;aying, Wilt thou continue to make no defence? Do&s;t thou not hear how vehe|mently the&s;e men accu&s;e thee? But Pilate recollecting what the chief prie&s;ts had &s;aid with regard to a &s;edition in Galilee, a&s;ked if JESUS came out of that country; and on being informed he did, he immediately ordered him to be carried to Herod, who then re&s;ided at Jeru&s;alem; for the governor &s;uppo&s;ed that Herod, in who&s;e dominions the &s;edition was &s;aid to have been rai&s;ed, mu&s;t be a much better judge of the affair than him&s;elf: be&s;ides, his being a Jew, rendered him more expert in the religion of his own country, and gave him greater influence over the chief prie&s;ts and elders: he therefore con&s;idered him as the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to prevail on the Jewi&s;h council to de&s;i&s;t from their cruel pro&s;ecution: but if, contrary to all human probability, he &s;hould, at their &s;olicitation, condemn JESUS, Pilate hoped to e&s;cape the guilt and infamy of putting an

In this he was however mi&s;taken: for as Herod had apo&s;tatized from the doctrine of John the Bapti&s;t, to which he was once a convert, and had even put this teacher to death, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, however liberal of his miracles to the &s;ons and daughters of affliction, would not work them to gratify the curio&s;ity of a tyrant, nor even an&s;wer one of the many que&s;tions he propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>FINDING him&s;elf thus di&s;appointed, Herod ordered our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour to be clothed with an old robe, re&s;embling in colour, tho&s;e worn by kings, and permitted his attend|ants to in&s;ult him; perhaps to provoke him to work &s;ome miracle, though it &s;hould prove of a hurtful kind. From Herod's dre&s;&s;ing him in this manner, it evidently ap|pears, that the chief prie&s;ts and elders had accu&s;ed him of nothing, but his having a&s;&s;u|med the character of the Me&s;&s;iah; for the affront put upon him was plainly in deri&s;ion of that preten&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE other head of accu&s;ation, namely, his having attempted to rai&s;e a &s;edition in Galilee, on account of the tribute paid to Cae&s;ar, they did not dare to mention, as Herod could not fail of knowing it to be a gro&s;s and malicious fal&s;ehood; and no crime worthy of death being laid to his charge, Herod &s;ent him again to Pilate. It &s;eems, that though he was di&s;plea&s;ed with the great Redeemer of mankind for refu&s;ing to work a miracle before him, yet he did not think proper to be unju&s;t to him. Perhaps he was re&s;trained by the remor&s;e he felt on account of the death of John the Bapti&s;t, and therefore de|clined bringing a greater weight upon his con&s;cience.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Pilate gives the Jews their Choice of <HI>JESUS</HI> or Barabbas to be relea&s;ed: Upon the Clamour of the common People, Barabbas is loo&s;ed, and <HI>JESUS</HI> delivered up to be crucified: He is crowned with Thorns, &s;pit on, and mocked.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Roman governors at the pa&s;&s;over, made it a cu&s;tom to court the favour of the populace, by gratifying them with the relea&s;e of any one pri&s;oner they plea&s;ed. And at this fea&s;t, there was one in pri&s;on named Barabbas, who, at the head of a num|ber of rebels, had made an in&s;urrection in the city, and committed murder during the tumult.</P>
<P>THERE being now again a great multitude of people a&s;&s;embled before the governor's palace, they began to call aloud on him to perform the annual office of mercy, cu&s;tomary at the fe&s;tival they were now celebrating. Pilate, glad of this opportunity, told them, that he was willing to grant the favour they de&s;ired; and a&s;ked them whether they would have Barabbas or JESUS relea&s;ed unto them? But without waiting for an an&s;wer, he offered to relea&s;e JESUS, knowing that the chief prie&s;ts had delivered him through envy; e&s;pecially as Herod had not found him guilty of the crimes he had been accu&s;ed of.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="029927_0262_0FE339063746F870">DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions, Pilate received a me&s;&s;age from his wife, then with him at Jeru&s;alem, and who had that morning been informed of &s;omething in a dream which gave her great unea&s;ine&s;s. Perhaps it pre&s;aged the vengeance of the Almighty pur&s;uing her hu&s;band and family, on account of the inju&s;tice he was going to commit. But whatever the dream was, it had &s;o great an effect on this Roman lady, that &s;he could not re&s;t till &s;he had &s;ent an account of it to her hu&s;band, who was then &s;itting on the tribunal in the pavement, and begged him to have no hand in the death of the righ|teous per&s;on who was then brought to his bar.</P>
<P>AS the people had not yet determined whether they would have JESUS or Barabba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> relea&s;ed to them; Pilate, therefore, when he received the me&s;&s;age from his wife, called the chief prie&s;ts and rulers together, and, in the hearing of the multitude, made a &s;peach to them, in which he gave them an account of the examination which JESUS had undergone, both at his own and Hedod's tribunal, declaring that in both courts it had turned out honourably to his character; for which rea&s;on he propo&s;ed to them, that he &s;hould be the object of the peoples' favour, and be acquitted.</P>
<P>THE intent of Pilate, in doing the prie&s;ts the honour to con&s;ult their inclinations in particular, might, in all probability, be with a de&s;ign to &s;often their &s;tony hearts, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to move them for once to pity an unhappy, and innocent man. But he was per&s;uaded, that if pity was ab&s;olutely bani&s;hed from their callous brea&s;ts, his propo&s;al would have been acceptable to the people, whom he expected would embrace the fir&s;t opportunity of declaring in his favour. Yet in this he was di&s;appointed. They cried out all at once, <HI>Away with this man, and relea&s;e unto us Barabbas.</HI></P>
<P>YE apo&s;tate mortals, a few hours ago ye li&s;tened with rapture to his heavenly di&s;|cour&s;es, beheld with tran&s;port the many &s;alutary miracles wrought by this benevolent &s;on of the Mo&s;t High, and earne&s;tly importuned him to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne and &s;ceptre of David! Now nothing will &s;atiate your infernal malice but his precious blood! But remember ye mi&s;creants, ye mon&s;ters in the human form, that this &s;ame JESUS, whom ye beheld with &s;uch contempt before the tribunal of the Roman governor; this JESUS, who&s;e blood your infernal mouths &s;o loudly reque&s;ted, &s;hall one day come in the clouds of heaven to take vengeance on his enemies! And how will you be able to bear the &s;ight of his appearance, when the very heavens them&s;elves will melt at his pre|&s;ence, "the &s;un become black as &s;ackcloth of hair," the moon be turned into blood, and the &s;tars fly from their &s;pheres? How will ye then repent of your unju&s;t demand, and call to the mountains and rocks to fall on you, and hide you from the pre&s;ence of that immaculate Lamb of God, the tremendous judge of quick and dead!</P>
<P>THE governor him&s;elf was a&s;toni&s;hed at this determination of the multitude, and re|peated his que&s;tion, for he could hardly believe what he had him&s;elf heard. But on their again declaring that they de&s;ired Barabbas might be relea&s;ed, he a&s;ked them, <HI>What he &s;hould do with Je&s;us, which is called Chri&s;t?</HI> as if he had &s;aid, you demand that Barabbas &s;hould be relea&s;ed; but what &s;hall I then do with JESUS? you cannot &s;urely de&s;ire me to crucify him, whom &s;o many of you have acknowledged as your Me&s;&s;iah? <HI>But they cried, &s;aying, crucify him, crucify him. Then Pilate &s;aid unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</HI> They were &s;o re&s;olutely determined to have him de&s;troyed, that notwith&s;tanding Pilate urged them again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd again to de&s;ire his relea&s;e, declared his innocence, and offered &s;everal times to di&s;mi&s;s him; they would not hear it, uttering their rage, &s;ometimes in hollow, di&s;tant inarticulate murmurs, and &s;ometimes in furious outcries: to &s;uch a pitch were their pa&s;&s;ions rai&s;ed by the craft and artful in&s;inuations of the prie&s;ts, and their own thir&s;t for his blood.</P>

<P>PILATE, by this act and declaration, &s;eems to have intended to make impre&s;&s;ion on the Jewi&s;h populace, by complying with the in&s;titutions of Mo&s;es, which orders, in ca&s;e of an unknown murder, the elders of the neare&s;t city to wa&s;h their hands publicly, and &s;ay, <HI>Our hands have not &s;hed this blood.</HI> And in allu&s;ion to this law, the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, <HI>I will wa&s;h mine hands in innocency.</HI> According therefore, to the Jewi&s;h rites, Pilate made the mo&s;t &s;olemn and public declaration of the innocence of our dear Redeemer, and of his re&s;olution of having no hand in his death. Perhaps he flattered him&s;elf, that by this &s;olemn appeal, he &s;hould have terrified the Jewi&s;h populace; for a per&s;on of his under|&s;tanding and education, could not but be &s;en&s;ible, that all the water in the univer&s;e was not &s;ufficient to wa&s;h away the guilt of an unrighteous &s;entence. But notwith&s;tanding the &s;olemnity of this declaration, the Jews continued inflexible&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> out, with one voice, <HI>His blood be on us and on our children.</HI> Dreadful imprecation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ocks huma|nity! An imprecation which brought on them the dreadful vengeance of Omnipotence, and is &s;till a heavy burden on that perfidious people, who are di&s;per&s;ed all over the earth!</P>
<P>PILATE, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to alter their choice, relea&s;ed unto them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. And as it was the general practice of the Romans to &s;courge tho&s;e criminals they condemned to be crucified, Pilate ordered the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS to be &s;courged before he delivered him to the &s;oldiers to be put to death. The &s;oldiers having accordingly &s;courged JESUS, and received orders to crucify him, carried him into the Praetorium, or common hall, where they added the &s;hame of di&s;grace to the bitterne&s;s of his puni&s;hment; for &s;ore as he was by rea&s;on of the &s;tripes they had given him, they dre&s;&s;ed him in a purple robe, in deri&s;ion of his being the King of the Jews. Having dre&s;&s;ed him in this robe of mock-maje&s;ty, they put a reed in his hand, in&s;tead of a &s;ceptre, and after platting a wreath of thorns, they put it on his head for a crown; forcing it down in &s;o rude a manner, that his temples were torn&punc; and his face be&s;meared with his mo&s;t precious blood. To the Son of God in this condition, the rude &s;oldiers bowed the knee, preten|ding to do it out of re&s;pect; but, at the &s;ame time gave him &s;evere blows on the head, which drove the prickles of the wreath afre&s;h into his temples, then &s;pit on him, to expre&s;s their highe&s;t contempt and di&s;dain.</P>
<P>THE office of governor, obliging Pilate to be pre&s;ent at this &s;hocking &s;cene of inhu|manity, he was ready to bur&s;t with grief. The fight of an innocent and virtuous man, treated with &s;uch &s;hocking barbarity, rai&s;ed in his brea&s;t the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ations of pity: and though he had given &s;entence that it &s;hould be as the Jews de&s;ired, and had delivered our dear Redeemer to the &s;oldiers to be crucified, he was per&s;uaded, that if he &s;hewed him to the people in that condition, they mu&s;t relent, and petition him to let him go. Filled with this thought, he re&s;olved to carry him out, and exhibit to their view, a &s;pectacle capable of &s;oftening the mo&s;t envenomed, obdurate, enraged enemy. And in order to render the impre&s;&s;ion &s;till more poignant, he went out him&s;elf, and &s;aid unto them, Though I have &s;entenced this man to die, and have &s;courged him as one that is to be crucified; yet I once more bring him before you, that I may again te&s;tify how fully I am per&s;uaded of his innocence, and that ye may yet have an opportunity of &s;aving his life, and clearing the guiltle&s;s.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner had the governor fini&s;hed his &s;peech, than JESUS appeared on the pavement, with his hair, his face, his &s;houlders all clotted with blood, and the purple robe be|daubed with &s;pittle. And that the &s;ight of JESUS in this di&s;tre&s;s might make the greater
<PB N="250" REF="029927_0267_0FE3391480F095D8">
impre&s;&s;ion on the people, Pilate, while he was coming forward, cried out, <HI>Behold the man!</HI> As if he had &s;aid, will nothing make you relent? Have you lo&s;t all the feelings of hu|manity and bowels of compa&s;&s;ion? Can you bear to &s;ee the innocent, a &s;on of Abraham, thus injured? Perhaps al&s;o, the &s;oldiers were &s;uffered to buffet JESUS again on the pave|ment before the multitude, in order to excite their pity, or at lea&s;t their pride: for though they might not pity JESUS as a per&s;on unju&s;tly condemned; yet when they &s;aw one of their countrymen in&s;ulted by Heathens, it was natural for the governor to &s;up|po&s;e, that their national pride being provoked, it would have induced them to have demanded his enlargement: but all this was to no purpo&s;e. The prie&s;ts, who&s;e rage and malice had extingui&s;hed not only the &s;entiments of ju&s;tice and feelings of pity, natural to the human heart, but al&s;o that love which countrymen bear for each other, no &s;ooner &s;aw JESUS, than they began to fear the fickle populace might relent, and therefore, laying decency a&s;ide, they led the way to the multitude, crying out with all their might, Crucify him! Crucify him! Relea&s;e not this man, but Barabbas!</P>
<P>THE governor, vexed to &s;ee the Jewi&s;h rulers thus ob&s;tinately bent on the de&s;truc|tion of a per&s;on, from whom they had nothing to fear that was dangerous, either with regard to their church or &s;tate, pa&s;&s;ionately told them, that if they would have him crucified, they mu&s;t do it them&s;elves; becau&s;e he would not &s;uffer his people to mur|der a man who was guilty of no crime. But this they all refu&s;ed, thinking it di&s;ho|nourable to receive permi&s;&s;ion to puni&s;h a per&s;on who had been more than once pub|licly declared innocent by his judge: be&s;ides they con&s;idered with them&s;elves, that the governor might afterwards have called it &s;edition, as the permi&s;&s;ion had been extorted from him. Accordingly they told him, that even though one of the things alledged again&s;t the pri&s;oner were true, he had committed &s;uch a crime in the pre&s;ence of the council it&s;elf, as by law de&s;erved the mo&s;t ignominious death, He had &s;poken bla&s;phe|my, calling him&s;elf the Son of God, a title which no mortal could a&s;&s;ume without the highe&s;t degree of guilt: <HI>We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, becau&s;e he made him&s;elf the Son of God, a divine per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>PILATE's fear was increa&s;ed when he heard that JESUS called him&s;elf the Son of God: but knowing the ob&s;tinacy of the Jews in all matters of religion, he was afraid they would make a tumult in earne&s;t; or, perhaps he was him&s;elf more afraid than ever to take away his life, becau&s;e he &s;u&s;pected it might be true. He doubtle&s;s re|membered the miracles &s;aid to have been performed by JESUS, and therefore &s;u&s;pected that he really was the Son of God: for it is well known that the religion which the go|vernor profe&s;&s;ed, directed him to acknowledge the exi&s;tence of demi-gods and heroes, or men de&s;cended from the gods: nay, the Heathens believed, that their gods them|&s;elves &s;ometimes appeared upon earth in the form of men, and conver&s;ed with them.</P>
<P>THESE kind of reflections induced Pilate to go again into the judgment-hall, and a&s;k JESUS from what father he &s;prung, and from what country he came? But our ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour gave him no an&s;wer, le&s;t the governor &s;hould rever&s;e his &s;entence, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;e to crucify him. Pilate marvelled greatly at this &s;ilence, and &s;aid unto JESUS, Why do&s;t thou refu&s;e to an&s;wer me? Thou can&s;t not be ignorant that I am inve&s;ted with ab&s;olute power, either to relea&s;e or crucify thee. To which JESUS an&s;wered, I well know that thou art Cae&s;ar's &s;ervant, and accountable to him for thy management. I forgive thee any injury, which, contrary to thy inclination, the popular fury con&s;trains thee to do unto me. Thou ha&s;t thy power <HI>from above,</HI> from the emperor: for which cau&s;e, the Jewi&s;h high prie&s;t, who hath put me into
<PB N="251" REF="029927_0268_0FE33916059A5B50">
thy hands, and by pretending that I am Cae&s;ar's enemy, forces thee to condemn me; or if thou refu&s;e&s;t, will accu&s;e thee as negligent of the emperor's intere&s;t; he is more guilty than thee: <HI>He that delivered me unto thee hath the greater &s;in, being in&s;tigated thereto by malice.</HI></P>
<P>HEARING this &s;weet and mode&s;t an&s;wer, &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion was thereby made on Pilate, that he went out to the people, and declared his intention of relea&s;ing JESUS, whether they gave their con&s;ent or not. Upon which the chief prie&s;ts and rulers of I&s;rael cried out, <HI>If thou let this man go, thou art not Cae&s;ar's friend: who&s;oever maketh him|&s;elf a king, &s;peaketh again&s;t Cae&s;ar.</HI> If thou relea&s;e&s;t the pri&s;oner, who hath &s;et him&s;elf up for a king, and endeavoured to rai&s;e a rebellion in the country, thou art unfaithful to the intere&s;t of the emperor thy ma&s;ter. This argument was weighty, and &s;hook Pilate's re&s;olution to the very ba&s;is: he was terrified at the thought of being accu&s;ed to Ti|berius, who in all affairs of goverment always &s;u&s;pected the wor&s;t, and puni&s;hed the mo&s;t minute crimes relative thereto, with death. The governor being thus con&s;trained to yield contrary to his inclination, was very angry with the prie&s;ts for &s;tirring up the people to &s;uch a pitch of madne&s;s, and determined to affront them. He therefore brough JESUS out a &s;econd time into the pavemant, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns; and, pointing to him, &s;aid, <HI>Behold your King;</HI> ridiculing the national expectation of a Me&s;&s;iah, as their deliverer.</P>
<P>STUNG to the quick, by this &s;arca&s;tical expre&s;&s;ion, they cried out, <HI>Away with him, away with him, crucify him.</HI> To which Pilate an&s;wered, with the &s;ame mocking air, <HI>Shall I cru|cify your king? The chief prie&s;ts an&s;wered, We have no king but Cae&s;ar.</HI> Thus did they publicly renounce their hope of the Me&s;&s;iah, which the whole economy of their religion had been calculated to cheri&s;h; they al&s;o publicly acknowledged their &s;ubjections to the Romans; and, con&s;equently, condemned them&s;elves, when they afterwards rebelled again&s;t the emperor Ve&s;pa&s;ian, who, with his &s;on Titus, de&s;troyed their city and temple.</P>
<P>WE may hear ob&s;erve, that the great unwillingne&s;s of the governor to pa&s;s &s;entence of death upon Je&s;us, has &s;omething in it very remarkable. For from the character of Pilate, as drawn by the Roman hi&s;torians them&s;elves, he &s;eems to have been far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any true principle of virtue. To what then could it be owing, that &s;o wicked a man &s;hould &s;o &s;teadily adhere to the cau&s;e of innocence, which he defended with uncommon bravery, and perhaps would never have abandoned it, had he not been forced by the theatenings of the chief prie&s;ts and rulers of I&s;rael? And when he did yield, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence upon our dear Redeemer, why did he &s;till declare him innocent? This can certainly be attributed to no other cau&s;e than to the &s;ecret and powerful direction of the providence of the Almighty, who intended that at the &s;ame time his &s;on was condemned and executed as a malefactor, his innocence &s;hould be made appear in the mo&s;t public manner, and by the mo&s;t authentic evidence; even that of the judge him&s;elf. It was the power of the Almighty that &s;et bounds to the inveterate malice and fury of the Jews, that would not &s;uffer them to &s;tain the innocence of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, at the &s;ame time they deprived him of his life; but &s;aid to their boi&s;terous malice, as he had before &s;aid to the foaming billows of the ocean, <HI>Hitherto &s;halt thou come, but no further, and here &s;halt thy proud waves be &s;tayed:</HI> for none can &s;tay his hand, or controul his will.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>O MY &s;oul! come and follow thy Redeemer to the la&s;t &s;cene of the mo&s;t innocent and u&s;eful cour&s;e that was ever pa&s;&s;ed on earth; follow him to Calvary's horrid emi|nenee, to Calvary's fatal cata&s;trophe; there fix thy mo&s;t con&s;tant attention on that lovely, that &s;orrowful &s;pectacle. Behold the &s;potle&s;s victim nailed to a tree, and &s;tabbed to the heart; hear him pouring out prayers for his murderers, before he poured out his &s;oul for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; &s;ee the wounds that &s;tream with forgivene&s;s, and bleed balm for a di&s;tem|pered world, O! &s;ee the ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of the Almighty, his mercy and his ven|geance; all his tremendous and gracious attributes manife&s;ted; manife&s;ted with inex|pre&s;&s;ible &s;plendour, in the mo&s;t ignominious, and yet grande&s;t of tran&s;actions that ever the world beheld!</P>
<P>AFTER &s;entence was pronounced again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, the &s;oldiers were ordered to prepare for his execution; a command which they readily obeyed, and after clothing him in his own garments, led him away to crucify him. It is not &s;aid that they took the crown of thorns from his temples; probably he died wearing it, that the title placed over his head might be the better under&s;tood by the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>THE mini&s;ters of Jewi&s;h malice we may &s;uppo&s;e, remitted none of the circum&s;tances of affliction, which were ever laid on per&s;ons condemned to be crucified. Accordingly, JESUS was obliged to walk on foot to the place of execution, bearing his cro&s;s; but the fatigue of the preceeding night &s;pent without &s;leep, the &s;ufferings he had undergone in the garden; his having been hurried from place to place, and obliged to &s;tand the whole time of his trials; the want of food, and the lo&s;s of blood he had &s;u&s;tained, and not his want of courage on this occa&s;ion made him faint under the burden of his cro&s;s. The &s;ol|diers, &s;eeing him unable to bear the weight, laid it on one Simon, a native of Cyrene, in Egypt, the father of Alexander and Rufus, well known among the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, and forced him to bear it after the great Redeemer of mankind. The &s;oldiers did not this, however, out of compa&s;&s;ion to the &s;uffering JESUS, but to prevent his dying with the fa|tigue, and by that means avoiding the puni&s;hment de&s;igned for him.</P>
<P>IN this journey to Calvary our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour was followed by an innumerable multi|tude of people, particularly of women, who lamented bitterly the &s;everity of his &s;entence, and &s;hewed all the tokens of &s;incere compa&s;&s;ion and grief. JESUS, who always felt the woes of others more than he did his own, forgetting his di&s;tre&s;s at the very time when it lay heavie&s;t upon him, turned him&s;elf about, and, with a benevolence and ten|derne&s;s truly divine, &s;aid to them, <HI>Daughters of Jeru&s;alem, weep not for me, but weep for your&s;elves and for your children.

them for the deplorable fate of your&s;elves and your children; for the calamities that will &s;oon fall on you and your offspring, are truly terrible, and call for the bittere&s;t lamenta|tion. In tho&s;e days of vengeance you will pa&s;&s;ionately wi&s;h that you had not given birth to a generation; who&s;e wickedne&s;s has rendered them the objects of the wrath of the Al|mighty to &s;uch a degree as was never before experienced in the world. Then &s;hall they wi&s;h to be cru&s;hed under the weight of enormous mountains, and concealed from their enemies in the bowels of the earth. The thoughts of the&s;e calamities afflict my &s;oul far more than the feeling of my own &s;ufferings: for if the Romans are permitted to inflict puni&s;hments on me who am innocent, how dreadful mu&s;t the vengeance be which they &s;hall inflict on a nation who&s;e &s;ins cry aloud to heaven, ha&s;tening the pace of the divine judgments, and rendering the perpetrators as proper for judgment as dry wood, is for flames of fire.</P>
<P>AT the place of execution, which was called Golgotha, or the place of a &s;kull, from the criminal bones which lay &s;cattered there, &s;ome of our Redeemer's friends offered him a &s;tupifying potion, to render him in&s;en&s;ible of the ignominy and excruciating pain of his puni&s;hment; but as &s;oon as he ta&s;ted the potion he refu&s;ed to drink it, being determined to bear his &s;ufferings, however &s;harp, not by intoxicating and &s;tupifying him&s;elf, but by the &s;trength of patience, fortitude, and faith.</P>
<P>HAVING therefore refu&s;ed the potion, the &s;oldiers began to execute their orders by &s;tripping him quite naked, and in that condition began to fa&s;ten him to his cro&s;s. But while they were piercing his hands and his feet with nails, in&s;tead of crying out with the &s;harpne&s;s of the pain, he calmly, though &s;everely prayed for them, and for all tho&s;e who had any hand in his death; be&s;eeching the Almighty to forgive them, and excu&s;ing them him&s;elf by the only circum&s;tance that could alleviate their guilt; I mean, their igno|rance. <HI>Father,</HI> &s;aid the compa&s;&s;ionate Redeemer of mankind, <HI>forgive them: for they know not what they do.</HI> This was infinite meekne&s;s and goodne&s;s, truly worthy of the only be|gotten Son of God; an example of forgivene&s;s, which, though it can never be equalled by any, &s;hould be imitated by all, when &s;uffering in a good cau&s;e.</P>
<P>BEHOLD now the appointed &s;oldiers dig the hole in which the cro&s;s was to be erected. The cro&s;s is placed in the ground, and the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us lies on the bed of &s;orrows; they nail him to it; they erect it; his nerves crack; his blood di&s;tils; he hangs upon his wounds naked, a &s;pectacle to heaven and earth. Thus was the only begotten Son of God, who came down from heaven to &s;ave the world, crucified by his own creatures; and, to render the ignominy &s;till greater, placed between two thieves: <HI>Hear, O heavens! O earth, earth hear! The Lord hath nouri&s;hed and brought up children, and they have rebelled again&s;t him;</HI> by rejecting the only Saviour, and the God of all their mercies.</P>
<P>CRIMES committed by malefactors were u&s;ually written on a white board with black, and placed over their heads on the cro&s;s. In conformity to this cu&s;tom, Pilate wrote a title in the Hebrew, Greek and Latin languages, that all foreigners as well as natives, might be able to read it, and fa&s;tened it to the cro&s;s, over the head of JESUS; and the in&s;cription was JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. But when the chief prie&s;ts and elders had read this title they were greatly di&s;plea&s;ed; becau&s;e, as it repre&s;ented the crime for which JESUS was condemned, it in&s;inuated that he had been acknowledged for the Me&s;&s;iah: be&s;ides, being placed over the head of one who was dy|ing by the mo&s;t infamous puni&s;hment, it implied that all who attempted to deliver the Jews, &s;hould peri&s;h in the &s;ame manner. The faith and hope of the nation, therefore, being thus publicly ridiculed, it is no wonder that the prie&s;ts thought them&s;elves highly

affronted; and, accordingly came to Pilate, begging that the writing might be altered; but as he had intended the affront in revenge for their forcing him to crucify JESUS, con|trary both to his judgment and inclination, he refu&s;ed to grant their reque&s;t: <HI>What I have written,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I have written;</HI> and per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution not to alter the in|&s;cription.</P>
<P>THE &s;oldiers, having nailed the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS to the cro&s;s, and erected it, divided his garments among&s;t them; but his coat, or ve&s;ture, being without &s;eam, woven from the top throughout, they agreed not to rend it, but to ca&s;t lots for it, that the prediction of the prophet concerning the death and &s;ufferings of the Me&s;&s;iah might be fulfilled: <HI>They parted my garments among&s;t them, and upon my ve&s;ture did they ca&s;t lots.</HI> A &s;ufficient indica|tion that every circum&s;tance of the death and pa&s;&s;ion of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS was long before determined in the court of heaven; and accordingly, his being crucified between two malefactors was expre&s;sly foretold, <HI>And he was numbered with the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the common people, whom the vile prie&s;ts had incen&s;ed again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, by the malicious fal&s;hoods they had &s;pread concerning him, and which they pre|tended to found on the depo&s;ition of witne&s;&s;es, &s;aw him hang in &s;o infamous a manner upon the cro&s;s, and reading the in&s;cription that was placed over his head, they expre&s;&s;ed their indignation again&s;t him by &s;arca&s;tical expre&s;&s;ions: <HI>Ah, thou,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>that d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;troy&s;t the temple, and builde&s;t it in three days &s;ave thy&s;elf, and come down from the cro&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>THE multitude were not the only per&s;ons who mocked and derided the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, while he was &s;uffering to obtain the remi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ins of all mankind. The rulers, who now imagined they had effectually de&s;troyed his preten&s;ions to the character of the Me&s;&s;iah, joined the populace in ridiculing him, and with a meanne&s;s of &s;oul which many infamous wretches would have &s;corned, mocked him, even while he was &s;truggling with the agonies of death: they &s;coffed at the miracles by which he demon&s;trated him&s;elf to be the Me&s;&s;iah, and promi&s;ed to believe in him, on condition of his proving his preten&s;ions by de&s;cending from the cro&s;s: <HI>He &s;aved others,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>him&s;elf he cannot &s;ave. If he be the King of I&s;rael, let him now come down from the cro&s;s, and we will believe him;</HI> not knowing what they &s;aid.</P>
<P>NOTHING could be more fal&s;e and hypocritical than this preten&s;ion of the &s;tiff-necked Jews; for they continued in their unbelief, notwith&s;tanding they well knew that he rai&s;ed him&s;elf from the dead; a much greater miracle than his coming down from the cro&s;s would have been, a miracle atte&s;ted by witne&s;&s;es who&s;e veracity they could not call in que&s;tion: it was told them by the &s;oldiers whom they them&s;elves placed at the &s;epulchre to watch the body, and who they were obliged to bribe largely to conceal the truth. It is therefore abundantly evident, that if the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS had de&s;cended from the cro&s;s, the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts would have continued in their infidelity; and con&s;equently that their declaration was made with no other intention than to in&s;ult the Redeemer of mankind, thinking it impo&s;&s;ible for him now to e&s;cape out of their hands. The &s;oldiers al&s;o joined in this general &s;cene of mockery, <HI>If thou be the King of the Jews</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>&s;ave thy&s;elf.</HI> If thou art the great Me&s;&s;iah expected by the Jews, de&s;cend from the cro&s;s by miracle, and deliver thy&s;elf from the&s;e excruciating torments, inflicted by thy enemies.</P>
<P>ONE of the thieves could not forbear mocking the great Lord of heaven and earth, though labouring him&s;elf under the mo&s;t racking pains, and &s;truggling with the agonies of death: but the other exerci&s;ed a mo&s;t extraordinary faith, at a time when our great Re|deemer was de&s;erted by his Father, mocked by men, and hanged upon the cro&s;s, as the mo&s;t ignominious of malefactors. This Jewi&s;h criminal &s;eems to have entertained a more

rational and exalted notion of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom than even the di&s;ciples them&s;elves; they expected nothing but a &s;ecular empire: he gave &s;trong intimations of his having an idea of CHRIST's &s;piritual dominion; for at the very time when JESUS was dying on the cro&s;s, he begged to be remembered by him when he came into his kingdom: <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>remember me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom.</HI> Nor did he make his reque&s;t in vain: the great Redeemer of mankind an&s;wered him, <HI>Verily, I &s;ay unto thee, to-day &s;halt thou be with me in Paradi&s;e:</HI> Thereby evidencing the immediate happine&s;s of the righteous after death.</P>
<P>LET us now attentively con&s;ider the hi&s;tory of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's pa&s;&s;ion, as it offers to our view events ab&s;olutely a&s;toni&s;hing: for when we remember the perfect innocence of our great Redeemer, the uncommon love he bore to the children of men, and the many kind and benevolent offices he did for the &s;ons and daughters of affliction; when we reflect on the e&s;teem in which he was held all along by the common people, how cheerfully they followed him to the remote&s;t corners of the country, nay, even into the de&s;olate retreats of the wilderne&s;s, and with what plea&s;ure they li&s;tened to his di&s;cour&s;es; when we con&s;ider the&s;e particulars, I &s;ay, we cannot help being a&s;toni&s;hed to find them at the conclu&s;ion, ru&s;hing all of a &s;udden into the oppo&s;ite extremes, and every indivi|dual as it were, combined to treat him with the mo&s;t barbarous cruelty and in&s;ult.</P>
<P>PILATE having a&s;ked the people, if they de&s;ired to have JESUS, relea&s;ed, his di&s;ciples, though they were very numerous and might have made a great appearance in his behalf, remained ab&s;olutely &s;ilent, as if they had been &s;peechle&s;s or infatuated. The Roman &s;oldiers, notwith&s;tanding their general had declared him innocent, in&s;ulted him in the mo&s;t inhuman manner; the Scribes and Phari&s;ees ridiculed him; the common people, who had received him with Ho&s;annas a few days before, wagged their heads at him as they pa&s;&s;ed by, and railed on him as a deceiver: nay, the very thief on the cro&s;s reviled him, in the mid&s;t of his &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>THOUGH this &s;udden revolution in the minds of the whole nation may &s;eem unaccounta|ble; yet if we could a&s;&s;ign a proper rea&s;on for the &s;ilence of the di&s;ciples, the principle, which influenced the re&s;t might be di&s;covered in their &s;everal &s;peeches. The followers of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS had attached them&s;elves to him, in expectation of being rai&s;ed to great wealth and power in his kingdom, which they expected would have been e&s;tabli&s;hed long before this time: but &s;eeing no appearance at all of what they had &s;o long hoped for, they permitted him to be condemned perhaps, becau&s;e they thought it would have obliged him to break the Roman yoke by &s;ome miraculous act of divine power.</P>
<P>THE &s;oldiers were angry that any one &s;hould pretend to royalty in Judea, where Cae|&s;ar had e&s;tabli&s;hed his authority: hence they in&s;ulted our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour with the title of King, and paid him, in mockery, the honours of a &s;overeign; and as for the common people, they &s;eemed to have lo&s;t their opinion of him, probably becau&s;e he had neither convinced the council, nor re&s;cued him&s;elf when they condemned him. They began, therefore, to con&s;ider the &s;tory of his pretending to de&s;troy the temple and build it in three days, as a kind of bla&s;phemy, becau&s;e it required divine power to perform &s;uch a work.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t implacable and diabolical malice irritated the prie&s;ts and Scribes again&s;t him; becau&s;e he had torn off their ma&s;ks of hypocri&s;y, and &s;hewed them to the people in their true colours. It is therefore, no wonder that they ridiculed his miracles, from whence he derived his reputation. In &s;hort, the thief al&s;o fancied that he would have delivered both him&s;elf and them, if he had been the Me&s;&s;iah; but as no &s;uch deliverance appeared, he upbraided him for making preten&s;ions to the high character he a&s;&s;umed.</P>

<P>BEHOLD the &s;un, con&s;cious of the &s;ufferings of his Maker, and as it were to hide his face from this dete&s;table action of mortals, is wrapped in the pitchy mantle of chaotic darkne&s;s! This preternatural eclip&s;e of the &s;un continued for three hours, to the great terror and a&s;toni&s;hment of the people pre&s;ent at the execution of our dear Redeemer. And &s;urely nothing could be more proper than this extraordinary alteration in the face of nature, while the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s was withdrawing his beams, not only from the promi&s;ed land, but from the whole world; for it was at once a miraculous te&s;timony given by the Almighty him&s;elf to the innocence of his Son, and a proper emblem of the depar|ture of him who was the Light of the world, at lea&s;t till his luminous rays, like the beams of the morning, &s;hone out anew with additional &s;plendour, in the mini&s;try of his apo&s;tles, after his a&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="029927_0274_0FE3392E5E58EBC0">THE darkne&s;s which now covered Judea and the neighbouring countries, beginning about noon, and continuing till JESUS expired, could not be the effect of an ordinary eclip&s;e of the &s;un. It is well known that the&s;e phaenomena can only happen at the change of the moon, whereas the Jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;over at which our dear Redeemer &s;uffered, was always celebrated at the full; be&s;ides, the total darkne&s;s of an eclip&s;e of the &s;un, never exceeds twelve or fifteen minutes, whereas this continued full three hours. No|thing, therefore, out the immediate hand of that Almighty Being which placed the &s;un in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tre of the planetary &s;y&s;tem, could have produced this a&s;toni&s;hing darkne&s;s: no|thing but Omnipotence who fir&s;t lighted this glorious luminary of heaven, could have deprived it of it's cheering rays.

Happy for you that this &s;uffering JESUS is compa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf, and even in the agonies of death, prays to his heavenly Father to avert from you the &s;troke of his ju&s;tice, thereby opening the gate of mercy even to you hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> murderers!</P>
<P>THE Heathens them&s;elves con&s;idered this preternatural eclip&s;e of the &s;un as a miracle, and one of them cried out, 'Either the world is at an end, or the God of nature &s;uffers!' And well might he u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion; for never &s;ince this planetary &s;y&s;tem was called from its primitive chaos, was known &s;uch a deprivation of light in the glorious lumina|ry of day. Indeed, when the Almighty puni&s;hed Pharaoh for refu&s;ing to let the children of I&s;rael depart out of his land, the &s;able veil of darkne&s;s was for three days drawn over Egypt: but this darkne&s;s was confined to a part of that kingdom; whereas this that happened at our Saviour's crucifixion, was univer&s;al, and not merely local.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples naturally con&s;idered the darkne&s;s, when it began, as a prelude to the deliverance of their Ma&s;ter: for though the chief prie&s;ts, elders, and people, had &s;ar|ca&s;tically de&s;ired him to de&s;cend from the accur&s;ed tree, his friends could not but be per|&s;uaded, that he who had delivered &s;o many from incurable di&s;ea&s;es, who had created limbs for the maimed, and eyes for the blind, who had given &s;peech to the dumb, and called the dead from the chambers of the du&s;t, might ea&s;ily &s;ave him&s;elf even from the cro&s;s. When, therefore, his mother, his mother's &s;i&s;ter Mary Magdalene, and the beloved di&s;|ciple ob&s;erved the veil of darkne&s;s begin to extend over the face of nature, they drew near to the foot of the cro&s;s, probably in expectation that the Son of God was going to &s;hake the frame of the univer&s;e, unloo&s;e him&s;elf from the cro&s;s, and take ample ven|geance on tho&s;e cruel and perfidious enemies who had &s;o de&s;pitefully treaed him.</P>
<P>AT this awful period, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS was in the mid&s;t of his &s;ufferings; yet when he &s;aw his mother and her companions, their grief greatly affected his tender brea&s;t, e&s;pe|cially the di&s;tre&s;s of his mother. The agonies of death, under which he was now la|bouring, could not prevent his expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t affectionate regard both for her and for them: for that &s;he might have &s;ome con&s;olation to &s;upport her under the greatne&s;s of her &s;orrows, he told her, the di&s;ciple whom he loved, would, for the &s;ake of that love, &s;up|ply his place to her after he was taken from them, even the place of a &s;on; and, there|fore, he de&s;ired her to con&s;ider him as &s;uch, and expect from him all the duties of a child: <HI>Woman</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>behold thy &s;on!</HI></P>
<P>THIS remarkable token of filial affection towards his mother, was not the only in&s;tance the dying JESUS gave of his &s;incere love for his friends and followers; the beloved di&s;|ciple had al&s;o a token of his high e&s;teem: he &s;ingled him out as the only per&s;on among his friends, to &s;upply his place with regard to his mother. Accordingly, he de&s;ired him

expre&s;sly to reverence her in the &s;ame manner as if &s;he had been his own parent: a duty which the favourite di&s;ciple gladly undertook; for he carried her with him to his hou&s;e, and maintained her from that hour to the day of her death; her hu&s;band Jo&s;eph having been dead &s;ome time before.</P>
<P>WE have now before us an evident proof, that in the mid&s;t of the heavie&s;t &s;ufferings human nature ever &s;u&s;tained, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS demon&s;trated a divine &s;trength of bene|volence; even at the time when his own di&s;tre&s;s was at the highe&s;t pitch, and nature was dre&s;&s;ed in the robe of mourning for the &s;ufferings of her great Creator: his friends had &s;o large a &s;hare of his concern, that their happine&s;s interrupted the &s;harpne&s;s of his pains, and for a &s;hort time engro&s;&s;ed his thoughts.</P>
<P>NOW the moment when JESUS &s;hould re&s;ign his &s;oul into the hands of his heavenly Father approached, and he repeated part of the twenty-&s;econd P&s;alm, uttering with a loud voice, the&s;e remarkable words, <HI>Eloi, Eloi, lama &s;abacthani?</HI> that is, <HI>My God, My God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</HI> Or, <HI>My God, My God, how long a time ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me!</HI> as the words may be rendered.</P>
<P>IT is believed by &s;ome, that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour repeated the whole P&s;alm, as it was cu&s;tomary with the Jews, in making quotations, to mention only the fir&s;t words of the P&s;alm or &s;ection which they cite. If &s;o, as this P&s;alm contains the mo&s;t remarkable par|ticulars of our Redeemer's pa&s;&s;ion, being as it were a &s;ummary of all the prophecies re|lative to that &s;ubject, by repeating it on the cro&s;s, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS &s;ignified that he was now accompli&s;hing the things that were predicted concerning the Me&s;&s;iah. And as the P&s;alm is compo&s;ed in the form of a prayer, by pronouncing it at this time, he al&s;o claimed of his Father, the performance of all the promi&s;es he had made, whether to him or to his people; the chief of which are recorded in the latter part of the P&s;alm above mentioned.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;ome of the people, who &s;tood by, heard our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour pronounce the fir&s;t words of this P&s;alm, they mi&s;under&s;tood him, probably from their not hearing him di&s;tinctly, and concluded that he called for Elias; upon which one of them filled a &s;punge with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, being de&s;irous of keeping him alive as long as po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ee whether Elias would come to take him down from the cro&s;s. But as &s;oon as JESUS had ta&s;ted the vinegar, he &s;aid, <HI>It is fini&s;hed:</HI> that is, the work of man's redemption is accompli&s;hed; that great work which the only begot|ten Son of God came into the world to perform, is fini&s;hed. In &s;peaking the&s;e words, he cried with an exceeding loud voice, and after that, he addre&s;&s;ed his Almighty Fa|ther in words which form the be&s;t pattern of recommendatory prayer at the hour of death; <HI>Father, into thy hands I commend my &s;pirit;</HI> and having uttered the&s;e words, he bowed his head, and yielded up the gho&s;t.</P>
<P>AT the very in&s;tant that the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS re&s;igned his &s;oul into the hands of his hea|venly Father, behold, the vail of the temple was miraculou&s;ly rent from the top to the bottom; probably in the pre&s;ence of the prie&s;t who burnt incen&s;e in the holy place, and who doubtle&s;s publi&s;hed the account when he came out: for our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour expired at the ninth hour, the very time of offering the evening &s;acrifice. Nor was this the only miracle that happened at the death of the great Me&s;&s;iah; no, the earth trembled from its very foundations, the flinty rocks bur&s;t a&s;&s;under, and the &s;epulchres hewn in them were opened, and many bodies of &s;aints depo&s;ited there, awaked after his re&s;urrection from the &s;leep of death, left the gloomy chambers of the tomb, went into the city of Jeru&s;alem, and appeared unto many. In all probability the&s;e &s;aints were di&s;ciples of our
<PB N="259" REF="029927_0276_0FE3393167C30808">
ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who had but lately pa&s;&s;ed through the valley of the &s;hadow of death; for when they went into the city, they were known to be &s;aints by the per&s;ons who &s;aw them, which could not well have happened if they had not been co-temporaries with them.</P>
<P>AS the rending of the veil of the temple intimated, that the entrance into the holy place, the type of heaven, was now laid open to all nations; &s;o the re&s;urrection of a number of &s;aints from the dead, demon&s;trated that the power of death and the grave was broken: the &s;ting was taken from death, and the victory wre&s;ted from the grave. In &s;hort, our dear Redeemer's conque&s;ts over the enemies of mankind, were &s;hewn to be complete, and an earne&s;t was given of the general re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>THE remarkable events which attended that awful period when JESUS gave up the gho&s;t, did not only affect the natives of Judea, but the Roman centurion, who was placed near the cro&s;s, to prevent di&s;orders of any kind, glorified the Almighty, and cried out, <HI>Truly this man was the Son of God.</HI> And all the people when they beheld heaven it&s;elf bearing witne&s;s of the truth of our great Redeemer's mi&s;&s;ion, &s;mote their brea&s;ts and returned. They had been in&s;tant with loud voices to have him crucified; but when they &s;aw the face of the creation wrapt in the gloomy mantle of darkne&s;s during his crucifixion, and found his death accompanied with an earthquake, as if na|ture had been in agony when he died, they rightly interpreted the&s;e prodegies to be &s;o many te&s;timonies from the Almighty of his innocence, and their pa&s;&s;ions which had been inflamed and exa&s;perated again&s;t him, became quite calm, or exerted in his behalf.</P>
<P>SOME were angry with them&s;elves for neglecting the opportunity the governor gave them of &s;aving his life; &s;ome were &s;tung with remor&s;e for having been active in pro|curing Pilate to condemn him, and even offering the mo&s;t bitter in&s;ults, while he laboured under the cruele&s;t of &s;ufferings; and others were deeply affected at beholding the pains he &s;uffered, which were as &s;evere as they were unde&s;erved. The&s;e various pa&s;&s;ions being vi&s;ibly painted in their countenances, afforded a melancholy &s;pectacle; the whole mul|titude returning from the cruel execution, with their eyes fixed upon the earth, pen&s;ive and &s;ilent; their hearts ready to bur&s;t with grief, groaning deeply within them&s;elves, &s;heddding floods of tears, and &s;mitting on their brea&s;ts, to te&s;tify their &s;orrow.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable that the grief they now felt for the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS was di&s;tingiu&s;hed, from their former rage again&s;t him by this remarkable particular, that their rage was entirely owing to the artful in&s;inuations of the prie&s;ts; whereas their grief was the genuine, the natural feeling of their own hearts, greatly affected with the truth and innocence of him who was the object of their commi&s;eration: and as flattery had no &s;hare in this mourning, &s;o the expre&s;&s;ions of their &s;orrow was &s;uch as became a real, an unfeigned pa&s;&s;ion. Nor was this unaffected mourning &s;hewn by only a few per&s;ons, who might have been repre&s;ented as the particular friends of the &s;uffering JESUS; no, it was the general condition of the people who had repaired to Calvary, in order to behold the crucifixion of our dear Redeemer, that when they parted after he had given up the gho&s;t, they covered the roads, and, as it were, darkened all the &s;urrounding country.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Roman Soldier thur&s;ts his &s;pear into our Saviour's Side: Jo&s;eph of Aramathea comes to Pilate, and begs of him the Body of <HI>JESUS.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY the law of Mo&s;es, it was expre&s;sly forbidden that the bodies of tho&s;e who were hanged &s;hould remain all night on the tree. In conformity to this law, and becau&s;e the Sabbath was at hand, the Jews begged the governor, that the legs of the three per&s;ons crucified might be broken, to ha&s;ten their death. To this reque&s;t Pilate readily con&s;ented; and accordingly gave the nece&s;&s;ary orders to the &s;oldiers to put it in execution: but on perceiving that JESUS was already dead, the &s;oldiers did not give them&s;elves the trouble of breaking his legs, as they had done tho&s;e of the two malefactors that were crucified with him. One of them, however, either out of wantonne&s;s or cruelty, thru&s;t a &s;pear into his &s;ide and out of the wound flowed blood and water. Some &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;pear reached his heart; but however th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be, it is certain, from the water which i&s;&s;ued from the wound, that he pierced the pericardium; and con&s;equently mu&s;t have killed him, had he not before been deprived of life.</P>
<P>IT was of the greate&s;t importance to mankind that this wound was given, for it abundantly demon&s;trated the truth of our Saviour's death, and con&s;equently prevented all objections that the enemies to our holy faith would otherwi&s;e have rai&s;ed again&s;t it. The evangeli&s;t adds, that the legs of our great Redeemer were not broken, but his &s;ide pierced, that two particular prophecies might be fulfilled: <HI>A bone of him &s;hall not be broken;</HI> and, <HI>they &s;hall look on him whom they have pierced,</HI> and be convinced of the horrid impiety of the deed, as many of them afterwards were, on the preaching of Peter.</P>
<P>THERE was a per&s;on among&s;t the di&s;ciples of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, called Jo&s;eph of Arimathea; he was equally remarkable for his birth, fortune, and office. This man, who was not to be intimidated by the malice of his countrymen, went boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of his great Ma&s;ter: he had indeed nothing to fear from the Ro|man governor, who, during the whole cour&s;e of our Saviour's trial, had &s;hewn the greate&s;t inclination to relea&s;e him; but he had rea&s;on to apprehend, that this action might draw upon him the malice of the rulers of the Jews, who had taken &s;uch great pains to get their Me&s;&s;iah crucified. The great regard, however, he had for the remains of his Ma&s;ter, made him de&s;pi&s;e the malice of the Jews, being per&s;uaded that Omnipo|tence would defend him, and cover his enemies with &s;hame and confu&s;ion: and he well knew, that if no friend procured a grant of the body, it would be ignominiou&s;ly ca&s;t out among&s;t the executed malefactors, and perhaps be expo&s;ed to many indignities.</P>
<P>THE governor was at fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed at the reque&s;t of Jo&s;eph, thinking it highly improbable that he &s;hould be dead in &s;o &s;hort a time. He had indeed given orders for the &s;oldiers to break the legs of the crucified per&s;ons; but he knew it was not uncom|mon for them to live many hours after that operation was performed: for though the pain it left mu&s;t be exqui&s;itive in the la&s;t degree, yet as the vital parts remain untouched, life would continue &s;ome time in the mi&s;erable body. Pilate therefore called the centu|rion to know the truth of what Jo&s;eph had told him; and being convinced, from the an&s;wer of that officer, that JESUS had been dead &s;ome time, he readily granted the reque&s;t.</P>

<P><PB N="261" REF="029927_0279_0FE3393E1BAA3EB0">HAVING obtained his de&s;ire, this worthy coun&s;ellor repaired to mount Calvary; and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Nicodemus, took the body down from the cro&s;s. The latter was for|merly &s;o cautious in vi&s;iting JESUS, that he came to him by night; but in paying the la&s;t duties to his Ma&s;ter, he u&s;ed no a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t to conceal his de&s;ign: he &s;hewed a courage far &s;upe|rior to that of any of the apo&s;tles; not only a&s;&s;i&s;ting Jo&s;eph in taking down the body of JESUS from the cro&s;s, but bringing with him a quantity of &s;pices nece&s;&s;ary in the burial of his Saviour. Accordingly, they wrapt the body, with the &s;pices, in fine linen, and laid it in a new &s;epulchre which Jo&s;eph had hewn out of a rock for him&s;elf. This &s;epulchre was &s;ituated in a garden near mount Calvary; but being not entirely fini&s;hed when they depo&s;ited in it the body of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, they fa&s;tened the entrance by rolling a very large &s;tone upon it.</P>
<P>WHAT a wonderful &s;pectacle was now exhibited in this memorable &s;epulchre! He who clothes him&s;elf with light, as with a garment, and walks upon the wings of the wind, was plea&s;ed to wear the habiliments of mortality, and dwell among&s;t this pro&s;trate dead! Who can repeat the wondrous truth too often! Who can dwell upon the enchanting theme too long! He who &s;its enthroned in glory, and diffu&s;es bli&s;s among&s;t all the heavenly ho&s;t, was once a pale and bloody corp&s;e, and pre&s;&s;ed the floor of this little &s;epulchre! Wonder, O heavens! and be a&s;toni&s;hed O earth!</P>
<P>IN that &s;olemn hour how great was thy triumph, O death? never did thy gloomy realms contain &s;uch a pri&s;oner before.&mdash;Pri&s;oner, did I &s;ay? No, he was more than conqueror. He aro&s;e far more mightily than Samp&s;on from a tran&s;ient &s;lumber; broke down the gates, and demoli&s;hed the &s;trong holds of tho&s;e dark dominions. And this, O mortals, is your con&s;olation and &s;ecurity! JESUS has trod the dreadful path, and &s;moothed it for your pa&s;&s;age. JESUS, &s;leeping in the chambers of the tomb, has bright|ened the di&s;mal man&s;ion, and left an inviting odour in tho&s;e beds of du&s;t. The dying JESUS is your &s;ure protection, your unque&s;tionable pa&s;&s;port through the territories of the grave. Believe in him with all your hearts, and love and obey him, and you will find him the high way to Sion: he will tran&s;mit you &s;afe to paradi&s;e. Believe in him, and you &s;hall be no lo&s;ers, but un&s;peakable gainers by your di&s;&s;olution. For hear what the oracle of heaven &s;ays on this important point: 'Who&s;o believeth in me, &s;hall never die.' Death &s;hall no longer be inflicted as a puni&s;hment, but rather vouch&s;afed as a ble&s;&s;ing. Their exit is the end of their frailty, and their entrance upon perfection: their la&s;t groan is the prelude to life, immortality, and joy.</P>
<P>THE women of Galilee, who had watched their dear Redeemer in his la&s;t moments, and accompanied his body to the &s;epulchre, ob&s;erving that the funeral rites were performed in a hurry, agreed among them&s;elves, as &s;oon as the &s;abbath was pa&s;&s;ed, to return to the &s;epulchre, and embalm the body of their great Saviour, by anointing and &s;wathing him in the manner then common among&s;t the Jews. Accordingly, they returned to the city, and purcha&s;ed the &s;pices nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e; Nicodemus having furni&s;hed only a mixture of myrrh and aloes for the above end.</P>
<P>THE chief prie&s;ts and Phari&s;ees, during the&s;e tran&s;actions, remembering that JESUS had more than once predicted his own re&s;urrection, came to the governor, and informed him of it; begging, at the &s;ame time, that a guard might be placed at the &s;epulchre, le&s;t his di&s;ciples &s;hould carry away the body, and affirm that he was ri&s;en from the dead. This happened a li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le before it was dark in the evening, called by the Evangeli&s;t the next day, becau&s;e the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ews began their day at &s;un&s;et. This reque&s;t being thought rea&s;onable by Pilate, he gave them leave to take as many &s;oldiers as they plea&s;ed out of the cohort, which at the fea&s;t came from the ca&s;tle Antonia, and kept guard in
<PB N="262" REF="029927_0280_0FE3393FA1112238">
the porticoes of the temple. For that they were not Jewi&s;h but Roman &s;oldiers, whom the prie&s;ts employed to watch the &s;epulchre, is evident from their a&s;king them of the governor: be&s;ides, when the &s;oldiers returned with the news of our Saviour's re&s;urrection, the prie&s;ts de&s;ired them to report that his di&s;ciples had &s;tolen him away while they &s;lept&punc; and to encourage them to tell that fal&s;ehood boldly, promi&s;ed that if their neglect of duty came to the governor's ears, proper methods &s;hould be u&s;ed to pacify him, and deliver them from any puni&s;hment: a promi&s;e which there was no need of making to &s;ervants under their own immediate command.</P>
<P>NOW the prie&s;ts having thus obtained a guard of Roman &s;oldiers, men, long accu&s;|tomed to military duties, and therefore mo&s;t proper for watching the body, &s;et out with them to the &s;epulchre; and to prevent the&s;e guards from combining with the di&s;ciples in carrying on any fraud, placed them at their po&s;t, and &s;ealed the &s;tone which was rolled to the door of the &s;epulchre. Thus, whil&s;t the prie&s;ts cautiou&s;ly propo&s;ed to prevent the re&s;urrection of our great Redeemer from being palmed upon the world, and doubtle&s;s intended&punc; after the third day was pa&s;t, to &s;hew his body pub|licly as an impo&s;tor, they placed the truth of this &s;tupendous miracle beyond all doubt, by furni&s;hing a number of unexceptionable witne&s;&s;es to it, who&s;e te&s;timony they them|&s;elves could not refu&s;e or gain&s;ay, and therefore attempted to &s;tifle it.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, came very early in the morning to vi&s;it the &s;epulchre, in order to embalm our Lord's body: for the performance of which they had, in concert with &s;everal other women from Galilee, brought unguents and &s;pices. But before they reached the &s;epulchre, there was a great earthquake preceding the mo&s;t memorable event that ever happened among&s;t the children of men, the re&s;urrection of the Son of God from the dead: <HI>For the angel of the Lord de&s;cended from heaven, and came and rolled back the &s;tone from the door of the &s;epul|chre, and &s;at upon it: his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as &s;now; and for fear of him the keepers did &s;hake, and became as dead men;</HI> they fled into the city, and the Saviour of the world ro&s;e from the dead.

<P>IN the mean time, Mary Magdelene and the other Mary were &s;till on their way to the &s;epulchre, together with Salome, who joined them on the road; as they pro|ceeded on their way, they con&s;ulted among&s;t them&s;elves with regard to the method of putting their intention of embalming the body of their beloved Ma&s;ter in execution; particularly with re&s;pect to the enormous &s;tone which they had &s;een placed there with the utmo&s;t difficulty two days before: <HI>Who,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all roll us away the &s;tone from the door of the &s;epulchre? for it was very great.</HI> But in the mid&s;t of their deliberation about removing this great and &s;ole ob&s;tacle to their de&s;ign (for it does not appear they knew any thing of the guard) they lift up their eyes, and perceived it was already

rolled away<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s alarmed at &s;o extraordinary and &s;o unexpected a circum&s;tance, Mary Magdalene concluded, that the &s;tone could not be rolled away without &s;ome de&s;ign; and that they who rolled it away could have no other de&s;ign, than that of removing our Lord's body: and being convinced by appearances that they had really done &s;o, &s;he ran immediately to acquaint Peter and John of what &s;he had &s;een, and what &s;he &s;u&s;pec|ted; leaving Mary and Salome there, that if the other women &s;hould arrive during her ab&s;ence, they might acquaint them with their &s;urpri&s;e at finding the &s;tone removed, and of Mary Magdalene's running to inform the apo&s;tles of the extraordinary event.</P>
<P>THE Soldiers who where terrified at &s;eeing an awful me&s;&s;enger from on high, roll away the &s;tone from the door of the &s;epulchre, and open it in quality of a &s;ervant, fled into the city, and informed the Jewi&s;h rulers of the&s;e miraculous appearances. This account was highly mortifying to the chief prie&s;ts, as it was a proof of our Saviour's re&s;urrection that could not be denied; they therefore re&s;olved to &s;tifle it immediately; and, accordingly, bribed the &s;oldiers to conceal the real fact, and to publi&s;h every where, that his di&s;ciples had &s;tolen the body out of the &s;epulchre. What! the body taken away while the &s;epulchre was guarded by Roman &s;oldiers? Yes! the di&s;ciples &s;tole the body while the &s;oldiers &s;lept. A &s;tory &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent, and which &s;o evidently carries the marks of its own confutation with it, de&s;erves no an&s;wer. The prie&s;ts them|&s;elves could not be &s;o &s;tupid as not to fore&s;ee what con&s;truction the world would put upon the relation of per&s;ons, who pretended to know and tell what was done while they were a&s;leep, and in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER Mary Magdalene was gone to inform the di&s;ciples that the &s;tone was rolled away from the mouth of the &s;epulchre, and the &s;uppo&s;ed body taken away, Mary and Salome drew near towards the &s;epulchre, and at their arrival found what they expected, the body of their beloved Ma&s;ter gone from the place where it had been de|po&s;ited by Nicodemus and Jo&s;eph of Arimathea; but at the &s;ame time beheld, to their great a&s;toni&s;hment, a beautiful young man, in &s;hining raiment, very glorious to behold, &s;itting at the right &s;ide of the &s;epulchre. Matthew tells us, that it was the angel who had rolled away the &s;tone, and frightened away the guards from the &s;epul|chre. It &s;eems he had now laid a&s;ide his terrors in which he was then arrayed, and a&s;&s;umed the form and dre&s;s of a human being, in order that the&s;e pious women, who had accompained him during the greate&s;t part of the time of his public mini&s;try, might not be terrified: but, notwith&s;tanding his beauty and benign appearance, they were greatly affrighted, and on the point of turning back when the heavenly me&s;&s;en|ger, to bani&s;h their fears, told them, in a gentle accent, that he knew their errend: <HI>Fear not,</HI> &s;aid he; <HI>for I know that ye &s;eek Je&s;us, which was crucified. He is not here; for he is ri&s;en, as he &s;aid:</HI> and then invited them to come down into the &s;epulchre, and view the place where the Son of God had lain; that is, to look on the linen clothes, and the napkin that was about his head, and which he had left behind him when he ro&s;e
<PB N="264" REF="029927_0282_0FE33A2FEAE92F08">
from the dead: for to look at the place in any other view would not have tended to confirm their faith of his being ri&s;en.</P>
<P>GREATLY encouraged by the agreeable news, as well as by the &s;weet accent with which this me&s;&s;enger from the heavenly Canaan delivered his &s;peech, the women went down into the &s;epulchre, when behold another of the angelic choir appeared. Proba|bly the one &s;at at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of JESUS had lain; the po&s;ition in which they appeared to Mary Magdalene afterwards.</P>
<P>HOWEVER they did not yet &s;eem to give credit to what was told them by the angels; and therefore the other gently chid them for &s;eeking the living among&s;t the dead, with an intention to do him an office due only to the latter, and for not believing what was told them by a me&s;&s;enger from heaven, or rather for not remembering the words which their great Ma&s;ter had him&s;elf told them with regard to his own re&s;urrection: <HI>Why &s;eek ye the living amongst the dead? He is not here, but is ri&s;en: remember how he &s;pake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, &s;aying, The &s;on of man mu&s;t be delivered into the hands of &s;inful men, and be crucified, and the third day ri&s;e again.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this, when the women had &s;atisfied their curio&s;ity by looking at the place where our Lord had lain, and where nothing was to be found but the linen cloths, the angel who fir&s;t appeared to them re&s;umed the di&s;cour&s;e, and bade them to go and tell his di&s;ciples, particularly Peter, the glad-tidings of his re&s;urrection from the dead; that he was going before them to Galilee; and that they &s;hould there have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him in per&s;on.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples, it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, were ordered to go into Galilee to meet their great and beloved Ma&s;ter, becau&s;e they were now mo&s;t of them in Jeru&s;alem, celebrating the pa&s;&s;over; and it may ea&s;ily be imagined that, on the receiving the news of the Lord's re&s;urrection, many, if not all of them, would re&s;olve to tarry in Jeru&s;alem, in expectation of meeting him: a thing which mu&s;t have proved of great detriment to them at that time of the year, when the harve&s;t was about to begin, the &s;heaf of fir&s;t fruits being always offered on the &s;econd day of the pa&s;&s;over-week. In order therefore to prevent their &s;taying &s;o long from home, the me&s;&s;age was &s;ent direc|ting them to return to Galilee, with full a&s;&s;urance, that they &s;hould there have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing their great Lord and Ma&s;ter; and by that means be happily relieved from the &s;u&s;picion of his being an impo&s;tor, which doubtle&s;s had ari&s;en in their minds, when they &s;aw him expire on the cro&s;s. Hereupon the women, highly elated with the news of their Lord's re&s;urrection, left the &s;epulchre immediately, and ran to carry the di&s;ciples the&s;e glad-tidings.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, Peter and John, having been informed by Mary Magdalene, that the &s;tone was rolled away, and the body of JESUS not to be found, were ha&s;tening to the grave, and mi&s;&s;ed the women who had &s;een this vi&s;ion of angels. The&s;e di&s;ciples being a&s;toni&s;hed at what Mary Magdalene had told them, and de&s;irous of having their doubts cleared up, made all the ha&s;te po&s;&s;ible to the &s;epulchre; and John being youn|ger than Peter, arrived at the &s;epulchre fir&s;t, but did not go in, contenting him&s;elf with &s;tooping down and &s;eeing the linen cloths lying which had been wrapped about our Saviour's body. Peter &s;oon arrived, and went into the &s;epulchre, where he &s;aw the <HI>linen cloths lie; and the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but wrapped together in a place by it&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>IT is the opinion of &s;ome, that our dear Redeemer folded up the napkin, to &s;hew the perfect calmne&s;s and compo&s;ure with which he aro&s;e, as out of a common &s;leep: but however that be, it is certain that he left the grave clothes in the &s;epulchre, to

&s;hew that his body was not &s;tolen away by his di&s;ciples, who in &s;uch a ca&s;e would not have taken time to have &s;tripped it: be&s;ides, the circum&s;tance of the grave-clothes, di&s;po&s;ed the di&s;ciples them&s;elves to believe, when the re&s;urrection was related to them; but at pre&s;ent they had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion that he was ri&s;en from the dead, as the angels had affirmed.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;atisfied them&s;elves that what Mary Magdalene had told them was really true, tho&s;e two di&s;ciples returned to their re&s;pective habitations: but Mary continued weeping at the door of the &s;epulchre: &s;he had, it &s;eems, followed Peter and John to the garden, but did not return with them, being anxious to find the body; according|ly, &s;tepping down into the &s;epulchre to examine it once more, &s;he &s;aw two angels &s;it|ting, the one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of JESUS had lain. They were now in the &s;ame po&s;ition, as when they appeared to the other women; but had rendered them&s;elves invi&s;ible while Peter and John were at the &s;epulchre, &s;eek|ing our Lord.</P>
<P>MARY, beholding the&s;e heavenly me&s;&s;engers dre&s;&s;ed in the robes of light, was great|ly terrified: but they, in the mo&s;t endearing accent, a&s;ked her, <HI>Woman, why weepe&s;t thou?</HI> To which &s;he an&s;wered, <HI>Becau&s;e they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</HI> On pronouncing the&s;e words, &s;he turned her&s;elf about, and &s;aw JESUS &s;tanding near her; but the terror &s;he was in, and the garments in which he was now dre&s;&s;ed, prevented her from knowing him for &s;ome time. JESUS repeated the &s;ame que&s;tion u&s;ed before by the angel, <HI>Woman, why weepe&s;t thou?</HI> To which Mary who now &s;uppo&s;ed him to be the gardner, an&s;wered, Sir, if his body was trouble&s;ome in the &s;epulchre, and thou ha&s;t removed him, tell me where he is depo&s;ited, and I will take him away. But our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour willing to remove her anxiety, called her by her name, with his u&s;ual tone of voice. On which &s;he immediately knew him; and falling down before him, would have embraced his knees, according to that mode&s;ty and reve|rence with which the women of the Ea&s;t &s;aluted the men, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who were their &s;uperiors in &s;tation and dignity.</P>
<P>JESUS refu&s;ed this compliment, telling her, that he was not going immediately into heaven: he was often to &s;hew him&s;elf to his di&s;ciples before he a&s;cended, &s;o that &s;he would have frequent opportunities of &s;hewing her regard to him: and at the &s;ame time, &s;aid to her, <HI>Go to my brethren, and &s;ay unto them, I a&s;cend unto my father, and your father; and to my God, and your God.</HI> Thus did the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS contemplate with a &s;ingular plea&s;ure the work of redemption he had ju&s;t fini&s;hed. The happy relation between God and man, which had been long cancelled by &s;in, was now renewed: the Almighty, who had di&s;owned them on account of their rebellion was again reconciled unto them: he was become their God and Father: they were exalted to the honourable relation of CHRIST's brethren, and the &s;ons of God; and their father loved them with an affection far exceeding that of the mo&s;t tender-hearted parent upon earth.</P>
<P>THE kindne&s;s of this me&s;&s;age &s;ent by our dear Redeemer to his di&s;ciples, will ap|pear above all prai&s;e, if we remember their late behaviour; they had every one of them for&s;aken him in his greate&s;t extremity when he was &s;courged and mocked by the Roman &s;oldiers, derided by his countrymen, and &s;pitefully entreated by all, they hid them&s;elves in &s;ome place of &s;afety, and preferred their own &s;ecurity to the deliverance of their Ma&s;ter: when he fainted under the burden of the cro&s;s, not one of them was there to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; Simon, a Cyrenian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as compelled by the Roman &s;oldiers to ea&s;e him of this pondrous burden. But notwith&s;tanding they had refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Ma&s;ter during his &s;ufferings
<PB N="266" REF="029927_0285_0FE33A3B8F1ADA10">
for the &s;ins of the world, he graciou&s;ly, he freely forgave them; he a&s;&s;ured them of their pardon, and even called them by the endearing name of brethren, notwith&s;tanding their former &s;lighting conduct.</P>
<P>WE cannot help ob&s;erving that there is &s;omething very remarkable in this part of the hi&s;tory: none of the apo&s;tles, or male di&s;ciples were honoured with the fir&s;t vi&s;ions of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngels, or with the immediate news of the re&s;urrection of the Son of God, much le&s;s with the appearance of JESUS him&s;elf. The angels in the &s;epulchre kept them&s;elves invi&s;ible all the time that Peter and John were ob&s;erving the linen cloths and &s;atisfying them&s;elves that the body of their Ma&s;ter was not there: perhaps the male di&s;ciples in general were treated with this mark of di&s;re&s;pect, both becau&s;e they had, with &s;hameful cowardice, for&s;aken their Ma&s;ter when he was betrayed into the hands of his enemies, and becau&s;e their faith was &s;o weak that they had ab&s;olutely de&s;paired of his being the Me&s;&s;iah when they &s;aw him expire on the cro&s;s: but how different was that conduct of the women! Laying a&s;ide the weakne&s;s and timidity natural to their &s;ex, they &s;hewed an uncommon magnanimity on this melancholy occa&s;ion; for in contradiction to the whole nation, who with one voice required JESUS to be crucified as a deceiver, they proclaimed his innocence by tears, cries, and lamentations, when they &s;aw him led forth to &s;uffer on mount Calvary; accompanied him to the cro&s;s, the mo&s;t infamous of all puni&s;hments; kindly waited on him in his expiring moments, giving him all the con&s;olation in their power, though at the &s;ame time the &s;ight of his &s;ufferings pierced them to the heart; and when he expired, and was carried off, they accompanied him to his grave, not de&s;|pairing, though they found he had not delivered him&s;elf, but to appearance was con|quered by death, the univer&s;al enemy of mankind. Perhaps the&s;e pious women enter|tained &s;ome faint hopes that he would &s;till revive; or, if they did not entertain expec|tations of that kind, they at lea&s;t cheri&s;hed a &s;trong degree of love for their Lord, and determined to do him all po&s;&s;ible honour.</P>
<P>IT may be ob&s;erved, a faith &s;o remarkably &s;trong, a love &s;o ardent, and a fortitude &s;o un&s;haken, could not fail of receiving di&s;tingui&s;hing tokens of the divine approbation; and they were accordingly honoured with the news of CHRIST's re&s;urrection before the male di&s;ciples had their eyes cheered with the fir&s;t &s;ight of their beloved Lord, after he aro&s;e from the chambers of the grave; &s;o that they preached the joyful tidings of his re&s;urrection to the apo&s;tles them&s;elves. But there &s;eems to have been other rea&s;ons why our great Redeemer &s;hewed him&s;elf fir&s;t to the women: the thoughts of the apo&s;tles were con&s;tantly fixed on a temporal kingdom, and they had wre&s;ted all his words into an agreement with that favourite notion; and whatever they could not con&s;true as con&s;onant to that opinion, they &s;eemed either to have di&s;believed or di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING JESUS had foretold his own &s;uffering no le&s;s than &s;even different times, the apo&s;tles were a&s;toni&s;hed above mea&s;ure when they &s;aw him expire on the cro&s;s. Immortality and terre&s;tial dominion were, according to their notion, the characteri&s;tics of the Me&s;&s;iah; for which rea&s;on, when they found that in&s;tead of e&s;tabli&s;hing him&s;elf in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the univer&s;al empire, he had neither delivered him&s;elf from an handful of enemies, nor even from death, they gave over all hopes of his being the Me&s;&s;iah: and as for his re&s;urrection, they &s;eem not to have entertained the lea&s;t notion of it; &s;o that, when the news of this great event was brought to them, they con&s;idered it as an idle tale. But not &s;o the women; they were more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to their Ma&s;ter's in&s;tructions, and con&s;equently were much better prepared for &s;eeing him after his re&s;urrection than the apo&s;tles: for though they did not expect that he would ri&s;e from the dead, yet they were not prejudiced again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="029927_0286_0FE33A3D1327F228">THE apo&s;tles, on the other hand, not only ab&s;olutely rejected the matter at fir&s;t, as a thing incredible, but even after they were acquainted with the accounts the &s;oldiers had given of this tran&s;action; nay, after they had &s;een the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS him&s;elf, &s;ome of them were &s;o unrea&s;onable as &s;till to doubt. How much rather then would their incredulity have led them to &s;u&s;pect his appearing as an illu&s;ion, had he &s;hewed him&s;elf to them! The&s;e reports led them to recollect the arguments proper for di&s;po&s;ing them to believe; particularly the prophecies that had been &s;o often delivered in their own hearing, con|cerning his re&s;urrection. Hence the angels, when they told this event to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> men, and de&s;ired them to carry the news of it to his di&s;ciples, put them in mind of the predictions JESUS him&s;elf had made, as a confirmation of it. Hence we al&s;o &s;ee the rea|&s;on why JESUS, before he made him&s;elf known to the di&s;ciples at Emmaus, prepared them for a di&s;covery, by expounding to them on the road, the &s;everal prophecies concerning the Me&s;&s;iah, contained in the Old Te&s;tament, which hitherto they had little attended to, or did not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>THE company of women, we have ob&s;erved, returned to the city, while Peter, John, and Mary Magdalene, were at the &s;epulchre. On their arrival they told as many of the di&s;ciples as they could find, that they had &s;een at the &s;epulchre a vi&s;ion of angels, who a&s;&s;ured them that JESUS was ri&s;en from the dead. This new information a&s;toni&s;hed the di&s;ciples exceedingly: and as they had before &s;ent Peter and John to examine into the truth of what Mary Magdalene had told them concerning the body's being removed out of the &s;epulchre, &s;o they now judged it highly proper to &s;end &s;ome of their number to &s;ee the angels, and learn from them the joyful tidings of that great tran&s;action of which the women had given them an account. That this was really the ca&s;e, appears from what the di&s;ciples, in their journey to Emmaus, told their great Lord and Ma&s;ter; namely they, when the women came and told them that they had &s;een a vi&s;ion of angels, certain of their number went to the &s;epulchre, and found it even as the women had &s;aid, but &s;aw not JESUS.</P>
<P>WE may venture to affirm, that this &s;econd deputation from the apo&s;tles did not go alone; for as Mary Magdalene returned with Peter and John, who went to examine the truth of her information, &s;o the women who brought an account of the vi&s;ion of angels, in all probability returned with tho&s;e who were &s;ent to be witne&s;&s;es of the truth of their report: be&s;ides curio&s;ity, they had an errand thither. The angels had expre&s;sly ordered them to tell the news to Peter in particular; for which rea&s;on, when they under&s;tood that he was gone to the &s;epulchre, it is natural to think they would return with the di&s;|ciples to &s;eek him. About the time that the di&s;ciples and women &s;et out for the &s;epulchre, Peter and John reached the city, but pa&s;&s;ing through a different &s;treet, did not meet their brethren in the way.</P>
<P>HAVING a great de&s;ire to reach the &s;epulchre, the di&s;ciples &s;oon left the women behind, and ju&s;t as they arrived, Mary Magdalene having &s;een the Lord, was coming away; but they did not meet her, becau&s;e they entered the garden at one door, while &s;he was coming out at another. When they came to the &s;epulchre, they &s;aw the angels, and received from them the news of their ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter's re&s;urrection; for St. Luke tells us, <HI>they found it even as the women had &s;aid.</HI> Highly elated with their &s;ucce&s;s, they departed and ran back to the city, with &s;uch expedition, that they gave an account of what they had &s;een in the hearing of the two di&s;ciples, before Mary Magdalene arrived. Nor will their &s;peed appear at all incredible, if we con&s;ider that the nature of the tidings the apo&s;tles had to carry gave them wings, as it were, to make their brethren partakers of their joy at this &s;urpri&s;ing event.</P>

<P>THESE pious women having tarried &s;ome time with JESUS on the road, did not arrive with the joyful tidings of their great Ma&s;ter's re&s;urrection, till &s;ome time after Peter and John; and perhaps were overtaken by Mary Magdalene on the road, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he arrived a few minutes before them.

<P>NOT long after the womens' fir&s;t return to the di&s;ciples with the news that they had &s;een a vi&s;ion of angels, who told them, that JESUS was ri&s;en from the dead, two of the brethren departed on their journey to a village called Emmaus, about two miles di&s;tant from Jeru&s;alem. The concern they were in on account of the death of their great and beloved Ma&s;ter, was &s;ufficiently vi&s;ible in their countenances; and as they pur&s;ued their journey talking with one another, and debating about the things that had lately happened among&s;t them, concerning the life and doctrine, the &s;ufferings and death of the holy JESUS, and of the report that was ju&s;t &s;pread among&s;t his di&s;ciples, of his being
<PB N="269" REF="029927_0288_0FE33A47949D7B28">
that very morning ri&s;en from the dead, JESUS him&s;elf overtook them, and joined their company.</P>
<P>APPEARING like a &s;tranger, they did not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect, that their fellow-traveller was no other than the great Redeemer of the &s;ons of men. He &s;oon entered into di&s;|cour&s;e with them, by inquiring what event had &s;o clo&s;ely engaged them in conver&s;ation, and why they appeared &s;o &s;orrowful and dejected, as if they had met with &s;ome heavy di&s;appointment or &s;ore affliction?</P>
<P>CLEOPHAS, one of the di&s;ciples, being &s;urpri&s;ed at the que&s;tion, replied, is it po&s;&s;ible, that you can be &s;o great a &s;tranger to the affairs of the world, as to have been at Jeru|&s;alem, and not have heard the &s;urpri&s;ing events that have happened there: events that have a&s;toni&s;hed the whole city, and are now the con&s;tant topic of conver&s;ation among&s;t all the inhabitants? JESUS an&s;wered, what &s;urpri&s;ing events do you mean? To which Cleophas replied, The tran&s;actions which have happened concerning JESUS of Nazareth, who appeared as a great prophet and teacher &s;ent from God; and accordingly was highly venerated among&s;t the people, for the excellency of his doctrine, and the number, benefit, and greatne&s;s of his miracles. Our chief prie&s;ts and elders, therefore, envying him as one who le&s;&s;ened their authority over the people, apprehended him, and found means to put him to death; but we firmly believed he would have proved him&s;elf the Me&s;&s;iah, or great Deliverer: and this per&s;ua&s;ion we a long time &s;upported, nor were we willing to abandon it, even when we &s;aw him put to death: but it is now three days &s;ince the&s;e things were done, and therefore begin to fear we were mi&s;taken concerning him.</P>
<P>A thing indeed happened this very morning, which extremely &s;urpri&s;es us, and we are very &s;olicitous with regard to the event. Some women who had entertained the &s;ame hopes and expectations as we, going early in the morning to pay their la&s;t duties to their Ma&s;ter, by embalming his body, returned with great ha&s;te to the city, and informed us, that they had been at the &s;epulchre, but were di&s;appointed in finding the body; and to increa&s;e our &s;urpri&s;e, they added, that they had &s;een a vi&s;ion of angels, who told them that JESUS was ri&s;en from the dead. This relation appeared at fir&s;t to us as an idle tale, altogether incredible; but two of the company going immediately after to the &s;epulchre, found every thing exactly as the women had reported; they &s;aw the angels, but heard not any thing of the body&mdash;&s;o that we are &s;till in doubt and perplexity with regard to this wonderful event, and what the end of the&s;e things will be. JESUS replied, why are ye &s;o very aver&s;e to believe all that the prophets have with one voice predicted concerning the Me&s;&s;iah? Is it not clearly, and very expre&s;sly foretold, in all the prophetic writings, that it was appointed by the council of Omnipotence for the Me&s;&s;iah to &s;uffer in this manner, and that after &s;u&s;taining the greate&s;t indignities, reproach, and contempt from the malice and perver&s;ene&s;s of mankind, and even undergoing an ignominious and cruel death, to be exalted to a glorious and eternal kingdom. After having &s;aid this, he began at the writings of Mo&s;es, and explained to them in order, all the principal pa&s;&s;ages, both in the books of that great legi&s;lator, and the writings of the other prophets, relating to his own &s;ufferings, death, and glorious re&s;urrection, as predicted of them.</P>
<P>THIS he did, with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing plainne&s;s, clearne&s;s, and &s;trength, that the two di&s;ciples, not yet &s;u&s;pecting who he was, were as much amazed to find a &s;tranger &s;o well acquainted with all that JESUS did and &s;uffered, as they at fir&s;t wondered at his appearing to be totally ignorant of the&s;e tran&s;actions. They were al&s;o a&s;toni&s;hed to hear him inter|pret and apply the Scriptures to their pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, with &s;uch readine&s;s and convincing clearne&s;s of argument, as carried with it a &s;trange and unu&s;ual authority and efficacy.
<PB N="270" REF="029927_0289_0FE33A494C2F8D78">
When therefore they came to the village whither they were going, and JESUS &s;eemed as if he would have pa&s;&s;ed on and travelled further, they de&s;irous of his company, pre&s;&s;ed him, in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, to tarry with them that night, as it was then late in the evening.</P>
<P>THE great Redeemer of mankind con&s;ented to this reque&s;t, and when they were &s;at down to &s;upper, he took bread, and gave thanks to God, and brake it, and gave it to them in the &s;ame manner he u&s;ed to do while he conver&s;ed with them upon earth, before his death. This engaged their attention, and looking &s;tedfa&s;tly on him, they perceived it was their great and beloved Ma&s;ter; but they had then no time to expre&s;s their joy and a&s;toni&s;hment to their benevolent Redeemer; for he vani&s;hed out of their &s;ight immediately.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner did they perceive that their Ma&s;ter was departed, than they &s;aid one to another, How &s;low and &s;tupid were we before, not to know him on the road while he explained to us the Scriptures, when be&s;ides the affability of his di&s;cour&s;e, and the &s;trength and clearne&s;s of his arguments, we perceived &s;uch an authority in what he &s;aid, and &s;uch a powerful efficacy attending his words, and &s;triking our hearts with affection, as we could not but have known, if we had not been remarkably &s;tupid, to have been the very &s;ame that u&s;ed to accompany his teaching, and was peculiar to our dear Ma&s;ter, who &s;pake as never man &s;poke.</P>
<P>AFTER this &s;urpri&s;ing event, they did not think proper to &s;tay any longer in Emmaus, but returned that very night to Jeru&s;alem and found the apo&s;tles, with &s;everal other di&s;ciples, di&s;cour&s;ing about the re&s;urrection of their Ma&s;ter; and on their entering the room, the di&s;ciples acco&s;ted them, &s;aying, <HI>The Lord is ri&s;en indeed, and hath appeared unto Simon.</HI></P>
<P>THE reports of the women were little credited, &s;uppo&s;ing they were occa&s;ioned more by imagination than reality; but when a per&s;on of Simon's capacity and gravity declared he had &s;een the Lord, they began to think that he was really ri&s;en from the dead. Their belief of this was greatly confirmed by the arrival of the two di&s;ciples from Emmaus, who declared to their brethren, how JESUS had appeared to them on the road and how they di&s;covered him to be their Ma&s;ter, by his breaking of bread, when he &s;at down to &s;upper with them.</P>
<P>DURING this conver&s;ation of the di&s;ciples from Emmaus, de&s;cribing the manner of the appearing of JESUS to them, and offering arguments to convince tho&s;e who doubted the truth of it, their great Ma&s;ter him&s;elf put an end to the debate, by &s;tanding in the mid&s;t of them, and &s;aid, <HI>Peace be unto you.</HI></P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples were greatly terrified at this appearance of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, &s;uppo&s;ing they had &s;een a &s;pirit; for as they had &s;ecured the doors of the hou&s;e where they were a&s;&s;embled for fear of the Jews, and JESUS having opened the locks, by his miraculous power, without the knowledge of any in the hou&s;e, it was natural for them to think that a &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tance only could enter. The circum&s;tance therefore of the doors being &s;hut, is very happily mentioned by St. John; becau&s;e it &s;ugge&s;ts a rea&s;on why the di&s;ciples took their Ma&s;ter for a &s;pirit, notwith&s;tanding many of them were convinced that he was really ri&s;en from the dead, and were that moment conver&s;ing about the event.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to di&s;pel their fears and doubts; JESUS came forward, &s;pake to them in the mo&s;t endearing accent, &s;hewed them his hands and his feet, and de&s;ired them to handle him, in order to convince them&s;elves by the united report of their different &s;en&s;es,
<PB N="271" REF="029927_0290_0FE33A4AD1112400">
that it was he him&s;elf, and no &s;pectre or apparition: <HI>Why are ye troubled,</HI> &s;aid the bene|volent Redeemer of mankind, <HI>and why do thoughts ari&s;e in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my&s;elf: handle me, and &s;ee; for a &s;pirit hath not fle&s;h and bones, as ye &s;ee me have,</HI> Luke xxiv.38, 39.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e infallible proofs, the di&s;ciples were &s;ufficiently convinced of the truth of their Lord's re&s;urrection, and they received him with rapture and exultation: but their joy and wonder had &s;o great an affect on their minds, that &s;ome of them, &s;en&s;ible of the great commotion they were in, &s;u&s;pended their belief, till they had con&s;idered the matter more calmly: JESUS therefore knowing their thoughts, called for meat, and eat with them, in order to prove more fully the truth of his re&s;urrection from the dead, and the reality of his pre&s;ence with them at this time. When JESUS had given this further occular demon|&s;tration of his having vanqui&s;hed the power of death, and opened the tremendous portals of the grave, he again repeated his &s;alutation. <HI>Peace be unto you;</HI> adding, The &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion that my Father hath given unto me, I give unto you: go ye therefore into every part of the world, and preach the go&s;pel to all the children of men. Then breathing on them, he &s;aid, <HI>receive ye the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> to direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t you in the exe|cution of your commi&s;&s;ion: who&s;oever embraces your doctrine, and &s;incerely repents, ye &s;hall remit his &s;ins, and your &s;entence of ab&s;olution &s;hall be ratified and confirmed in the courts of heaven: and who&s;oever either ob&s;tinately rejects your doctrine, di&s;obeys it, or behaves him&s;elf unworthily, after he hath embraced it, his &s;ins &s;hall not be forgiven him; but the cen&s;ure ye &s;hall pa&s;s upon him on earth, &s;hall be confirmed in heaven, to his condemnation.</P>
<P>AT this meeting of the apo&s;tles, Thomas, otherwi&s;e called Didymus, was ab&s;ent; nor did this happen without the &s;pecial direction of Providence, that the particular and ex|traordinary &s;atisfaction which was afterwards granted him, might be an abundant and unde|niable te&s;timony of the truth of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's re&s;urrection, to all &s;ucceeding ge|nerations. The re&s;t of the apo&s;tles therefore told him, that they had &s;een the Lord, and repeated to him the words he had delivered in their hearing: but Thomas replied, This event is of &s;uch great importance, that unle&s;s, to prevent all po&s;&s;ibility of deception, I &s;ee him with my own eyes, and feel him with my own hands, putting my fingers into the print of the nails whereby he was fa&s;tened to the cro&s;s, and thru&s;ting my hand into his &s;ide which the &s;oldier pierced with his &s;pear; I will not believe that he is ri&s;en from the dead in reality and truth, as ye affirm.</P>
<P>WE have now enumerated, in the mo&s;t explicit manner, the tran&s;actions of that day, on which the great Redeemer of mankind aro&s;e from the dead; a day highly to be remembered by the children of men, throughout all generations; a day, in which was fully completed and di&s;played the conceptions lodged in the brea&s;t of Infinite Wi&s;dom from all eternity; even tho&s;e thoughts of love and mercy, on which the &s;alvation of the world depended, Chri&s;tians have, therefore, the highe&s;t rea&s;on to &s;olemnize this day with gladne&s;s, each returning week, by cea&s;ing from their labour, and giving up them|&s;elves to prayer, pious meditations, and other exerci&s;es of religion. The redemption of mankind, which they weekly commemorate, affords matter of eternal thought; it is a &s;ub|ject impo&s;&s;ible to be equalled, and who&s;e lu&s;tre, neither length of time, nor frequent review|ing can either tarni&s;h or dimini&s;h: it re&s;embles the &s;un, which we behold always the &s;ame glorious and luminous object; for the benefit we celebrate is, after &s;o many ages, as fre&s;h and beautiful as ever, and will always continue the &s;ame, flouri&s;hing in the me|mories of all rea&s;onable beings through the endle&s;s revolutions of eternity. Redemp|tion is the brighte&s;t mirror in which we contemplate the goodne&s;s of the Almightty,
<PB N="272" REF="029927_0291_0FE33A4C57B127B0">
other gifts are only mites from the divine trea&s;ury; but redemption opens, we had al|mo&s;t &s;aid exhau&s;ts, all the &s;tores of grace. May it be con&s;tantly the favourite &s;ubject of our meditations, more delightful to our mu&s;ing minds, than applau&s;e to the ambitious ear! May it be the darling theme of our di&s;cour&s;es; &s;weeter to our tongues, than the droppings of the honey-comb to the ta&s;te! May it be our choice&s;t comfort, through all the changes of this mortal life, and the reviving cordial, even in the la&s;t extremities of di&s;&s;olution it&s;elf, and upon the verge of the grave!</P>
<P>AFTER our great Redeemer had been ri&s;en eight days from the dead, he &s;hewed him&s;elf again to his di&s;ciples while Thomas was with them, and upbraided that di&s;ciple for his unbelief; but knowing that it did not, like that of the Phari&s;ees, proceed from a wicked mind, but from an hone&s;t heart, and a &s;incere de&s;ire of being &s;atisfied of the truth, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf particularly to this doubting di&s;|ciple: Thomas, &s;aid he, &s;ince thou wilt not be contented to rely on the te&s;timony of others, but mu&s;t be convinced by the experience of thy own &s;en&s;es, behold the wounds in my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thru&s;t it into my &s;ide, and doubt no longer of the reality of my re&s;urrection from the tomb.</P>
<P>THE incredulous di&s;ciple immediately obeyed the kind invitation of his Ma&s;ter; and being fully &s;atisfied according to his own de&s;ire, he cried out, I am abundantly convin|ced thou art indeed my Lord, the very &s;ame that was crucified; and I acknowledge thy almighty power, in having triumphed over death, and wor&s;hip thee as my God and Saviour.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS replied, Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t both &s;een and felt me, Thomas, thou ha&s;t believed that I am really ri&s;en from the dead. Ble&s;&s;ed are they who without &s;uch evidence of the &s;en&s;es, &s;hall, upon credible te&s;timony, be willing to believe and embrace a doctrine, which tends &s;o greatly to the glory of God, and the &s;alvation of mankind.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS appeared, according to St. John, on &s;everal other occa&s;ions to his di&s;ciples after his re&s;urrection; and by many infallible proofs, not mentioned by the evangeli&s;ts, fully convinced them, that he was alive after his pa&s;&s;ion: but that tho&s;e which are mentioned, are abundantly &s;ufficient to induce men to believe that JESUS was the Son of God, the great Me&s;&s;iah &s;o often foretold by the ancient prophets; and that by means of that belief, they may obtain everla&s;ting life, in the happy regions of the heavenly Canaan, and there adore and prai&s;e him for ever.</P>
<P>JESUS having fir&s;t by the angels, and afterwards in per&s;on, ordered his di&s;ciples to repair to their re&s;pective habitations in Galilee, it is rea&s;onable to think they would leave Jeru&s;alem as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. This they accordingly did, and on their arrival at their re&s;pective places of abode, applied them&s;elves to their u&s;ual occupations; and the apo&s;tles returned to their old trade of fi&s;hing on the lake of Tiberius. Here they were toiling with their nets very early in the morning, and &s;aw JESUS &s;tanding on the &s;hore, but did not then know him to be their Ma&s;ter, as it was &s;omething dark, and they at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance from him. He, however, called to them, and a&s;ked if they had taken any fi&s;h; to which they an&s;wered, they had caught nothing: he then de&s;ired them to let down their nets on the right &s;ide of the boat, and they &s;hould not be di&s;appointed. The di&s;ciples imagining that he might be acquainted with the places proper for fi&s;hing, did as he had directed them, and enclo&s;ed in their net &s;o va&s;t a multitude of fi&s;hes, that they were not able to draw it into the boat, but were forced to drag it after them in the water towards the land.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="029927_0292_0FE33A5563F4BA28">THEY had toiled, it &s;eems, all the preceding night to no purpo&s;e; and therefore &s;uch remarkable &s;ucce&s;s could not fail of cau&s;ing various conjectures among&s;t them, with regard to a &s;tranger on the &s;hore, who had given them &s;uch happy advice. Some of the di&s;ciples declared they could not imagine who he was; but others were per&s;uaded, that this per&s;on was no other than their great and beloved Ma&s;ter, John was fully convinced of his being the Lord, and accordingly told his thoughts to Simon Peter; who making no doubt of it, girt on his fi&s;her's coat, and leaped into the &s;ea, in order to get a&s;hore &s;ooner than the boat could be brought to land, dragging after it a net full of &s;uch large fi&s;hes as were almo&s;t ready to &s;ink it.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples, when they came a&s;hore, found a fire kindled, and on it a fi&s;h broiling, and near it &s;ome bread: but neither being &s;ufficient for the company, JESUS bid them bring &s;ome of the fi&s;h they had now caught, and invited them to eat with him. Thus did the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS prove again to his di&s;ciples the reality of his re&s;urrection, not only by eating with them, but by working a miracle, like that which, at the beginning of his mini&s;try, had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon them, as di&s;po&s;ed them to be his con&s;tant followers. This was the third time that JESUS appeared publicly to a great number of his di&s;ciples in a body, be&s;ides his &s;hewing him&s;elf to particular per&s;ons, up|on &s;pecial occa&s;ions and at divers times.</P>
<P>AFTER they had eaten, JESUS reminded Peter how diligent and zealous he ought to be, in order to wipe off the &s;tain of his denying him, when he was carried before the high-prie&s;t: <HI>Simon, &s;on of Jonas,</HI> &s;aid our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour to him, art thou more zealous and affectionate in thy love towards me, than the re&s;t of my di&s;ciples? To which Peter an&s;wered, <HI>Yea, Lord; thou knowe&s;t that I love thee.</HI> He was taught mode&s;ty and diffidence by his late fall; and therefore, would not compare him&s;elf with others, but humbly appealed to his Ma&s;ter's omni&s;cience for the &s;incerity of his regard to him. JESUS an&s;wered, Expre&s;s then thy love towards me by the care of my flock committed to thy charge: <HI>Feed my Lambs, feed my &s;heep.</HI> I well know indeed, continued the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, that thou wilt continue my faithful &s;hepherd even until death: for the time will come when thou, who now girde&s;t on thy fi&s;hers' coat voluntarily, and &s;tretched&s;t out thy hands to come to me, &s;halt in thine old age be girt by others, and forced to &s;tretch out thy hands again&s;t thy will, in a very different manner, for the &s;ake of thy con|&s;tant profe&s;&s;ion of my religion</P>
<P>JESUS, by the&s;e la&s;t words, &s;ignified the manner of Peter's death, and that he &s;hould finally &s;uffer martyrdom for the glory of God, and the te&s;timony of the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion, which he had been in&s;trumental in propagating to the world.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples being now about to meet their great Lord and Ma&s;ter, according to the me&s;&s;age he had &s;ent them by the women, and having, in all probability, appointed this meeting at &s;ome former appearance, not mentioned by the evangeli&s;ts, the brethren &s;et out for the mountain in Galilee, perhaps that on which he was transfigured. Here five hundred of them were gathered together, waiting the joyful &s;ight of their great Ma&s;ter, after he had triumphed over death and the grave; &s;ome of them not having yet &s;een him after his re&s;urrection from the dead.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples did not wait long before JESUS appeared, on which they were &s;eized with rapture; and with hearts overflowing with gladne&s;s, they approached their kind, their benevolent Ma&s;ter, and wor&s;hipped him. Some few, indeed, doubted, it being a thing agreeable to nature for men to be afraid to believe what they vehemently wi&s;h, le&s;t
<PB N="274" REF="029927_0293_0FE33A572C331428">
they &s;hould indulge them&s;elves in fal&s;e joys, which vani&s;h like the morning cloud. But JESUS afterwards appeared frequently to them, and gave all of them full &s;atisfaction, and in&s;tructed them in many things relating to their preaching the go&s;pel, e&s;tabli&s;hing the church, and &s;preading it through the known world.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, either at his appearance on the mountain, or &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent appearance, not mentioned by the evangeli&s;ts, probably ordered them to return to Jeru|&s;alem, as he propo&s;ed to a&s;cend vi&s;ibly into heaven from the top of the mount of Olives.</P>

<P><HI>JESUS</HI> a&s;cends into Heaven: The principal Arguments of the Dei&s;ts again&s;t our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's Re&s;urrection con&s;idered and refuted: Reflections on the Life and Doctrine of our great Redeemer.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT twelve days before the fea&s;t of Pentecho&s;t, called in the law <HI>the fea&s;t of weeks,</HI> and nearly forty days after our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour aro&s;e from the dead, the di&s;ciples repaired to Jeru&s;alem, probably in conformity to a command given them by their great Ma&s;ter at one of his appearances; unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e they went up to that city, in order to purify and prepare them&s;elves for the &s;olemnity now approaching.</P>
<P>HOWEVER that may be, the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS made his la&s;t appearance here to his apo&s;|tles: and, after in&s;tructing them in many particulars concerning the kingdom of God, and the manner they were to behave them&s;elves in propagating the doctrine of the go&s;|pel, he put them in mind that, during his abode with them in Galilee, he had often told them, that all things written in the law, the prophets, and the P&s;alms concerning him, were to be exactly accompli&s;hed. At the &s;ame time, he opened their under&s;tandings, that is, he removed their prejudices by the operation of his &s;pirit, cleared their doubts, improved their memories, &s;trengthened their judgments, and enabled them to di&s;cern the true meaning of the Scriptures re&s;pecting his divine mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BEING thus qualified by him for receiving the truth, he again a&s;&s;ured them that both Mo&s;es and the prophets had foretold that the Me&s;&s;iah was to &s;uffer in the very manner he had &s;uffered, that he was to ri&s;e from the dead on the third day, as he had done, and that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins was to be preached in the Me&s;&s;iah's name among&s;t all nations, beginning with the Jews at Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>AFTER this, he delivered unto them their commi&s;&s;ion to preach the doctrine of re|pentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins in his name among&s;t all nations, and to te&s;tify unto the world the exact accompli&s;hment in him of all things foretold concerning the Me&s;&s;iah; and, to enable them to perform this important work, promi&s;ed to be&s;tow on them the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, which he called the promi&s;e of his Father; becau&s;e the Almighty had promi&s;ed them by his prophets in the Old Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>BEING thus fortified for the important work they were going to undertake, he led them on to the Mount of Olives as far as Bethany; where, &s;tanding on a hill above the town, he told them that he was now rai&s;ed to the government of heaven and earth; for which rea&s;on, they might go courageou&s;ly through all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every rational creature; a&s;&s;uring them&s;elves that affairs in all countries &s;hould be &s;o ordered, as to di&s;po&s;e the inhabitants for the reception of the go&s;pel; that they
<PB N="275" REF="029927_0294_0FE33A58B30EE088">
who believed, were to be admitted into his church by the rite of bapti&s;m, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t; and to be taught, in con&s;equence of their bapti&s;m, to obey all the precepts he had enjoined them: that &s;uch bapti&s;ed be|lievers &s;hould receive pardon of their &s;ins, together with eternal life in the happy man|&s;ions of his Father's kingdom; but that tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to embrace the doctrines of the go&s;pel, &s;hould be for ever excluded tho&s;e happy regions, and have their portion in the lake that burneth with fire and brim&s;tone; that while they were employed in this work, he would be with them to the end of the world, to guide them by his coun&s;el, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them by his Spirit, and to protect them by his Providence. Finally, that tho&s;e who &s;hould, through their preaching, be induced to believe, &s;hould them&s;elves work mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing miracles, by which the go&s;pel &s;hould be propagated with the greate&s;t rapidity and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>AFTER JESUS had &s;poken the&s;e things&punc; he lifted up his hands and ble&s;&s;ed them; and in the action of ble&s;&s;ing them, he was parted from them in the mid&s;t of the day, a &s;hining cloud receiving him out of their &s;ight: that is, this brilliant cloud encompa&s;|&s;ed him about, and carried him up to heaven, not &s;uddenly, but at lei&s;ure, that they might behold him departing, and &s;ee the proof of his having come down from heaven, as he had promi&s;ed them.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS a&s;cended in a cloud which was more bright and pure than the cleare&s;t lambent flame, being no other than the Shechinab, or glory of the Lord, the vi&s;ible &s;ymbol of the divine Pre&s;ence which had &s;o often appeared to the patriarchs of old, which filled the temple at its dedication, and which, in its greate&s;t &s;plendour, cannot be beheld with mortal eyes; for which rea&s;on, it is called the light inacce&s;|&s;ible in which the Almighty re&s;ides, and with which he is &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>IT was probably on this occa&s;ion that our Lord's body was changed, acquiring the glories of immortality, perhaps in the pre&s;ence of his di&s;ciples, who &s;tedfa&s;tly beheld him as he mounted from the earth. And as he a&s;cended, the flaming cloud that &s;ur|rounded him marked his pa&s;&s;age through the air, but gradually lo&s;t its magnitude in the eyes of tho&s;e who &s;tood below, till at la&s;t it vani&s;hed, together with their beloved Ma&s;ter, out of their &s;ight; for he was received up where the Divine Being manife&s;ts him&s;elf in a peculiar manner, and was &s;et down on the righthand of the Maje&s;ty on high; all power in heaven and in earth being now given him: and this univer&s;al govern|ment he will hold, till he e&s;tabli&s;hes the dominion of righteou&s;ne&s;s, when he will deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father, <HI>that God may be all in all.</HI> 1 Cor. xv.28.</P>
<P>THUS did the great Redeemer of mankind depart in a mo&s;t illu&s;trious manner, after having fini&s;hed the grand work which he left the bo&s;om of his Father to execute; a work which God him&s;elf, in the remote&s;t eternity, contemplated with plea&s;ure, which angels with joy de&s;cried as to happen, and which, through all eternity to come, &s;hall at periods the mo&s;t immen&s;ely di&s;tant from the time of its execution, be looked back upon with inexpre&s;&s;ible delight by every inhabitant of heaven; for though the minute affairs of time may vani&s;h altogether and be lo&s;t, when they are removed far back by the endle&s;s progre&s;&s;ion of duration, this object is &s;uch, that no di&s;tance, however great, can le&s;&s;en it: the kingdom of heaven is erected on the incarnation and &s;ufferings of the Son of God, the kingdom and city of the Almighty comprehending all the virtuous beings in the univer&s;e, made happy by goodne&s;s and love; and, therefore, none of them can ever forget the foundation on which their happine&s;s &s;tands e&s;tabli&s;hed: the human &s;pecies in particular, recovered by the labour of the Son of God, will view their deli|verer,
<PB N="276" REF="029927_0295_0FE33A5A39855780">
and look back on his &s;tupendous undertaking with the highe&s;t rapture, while they are fea&s;ting without interruption, on its delicious fruits: the re&s;t of the members of the city of God, will contemplate it with perpetual plea&s;ure, as the happy means of reco|vering their kindred that were lo&s;t; po&s;&s;ibly the grand confirmation of the whole ra|tional &s;y&s;tem, in &s;ubjection to him who reigned for ever, who&s;e favour is better than life it&s;elf, and at who&s;e right-hand there are plea&s;ures for evermore.</P>
<P>WE have now followed our dear Redeemer through all the tran&s;actions of his life, and enlarged on the &s;tupendous miracles of his re&s;urrection, as the whole Chri&s;tian doc|trine is founded on that glorious event. And it is abundantly evident from this hi&s;tory, that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;hewed him&s;elf to his di&s;ciples and friends only, not to the Jews in general. This circum&s;tance gave Spinoza a pretence for rai&s;ing an objection, which his di&s;ciples have con&s;idered as the &s;tronge&s;t argument again&s;t our Lord's re&s;urrection. 'If, &s;ay they, he really ro&s;e from the dead, to have &s;hewed him&s;elf to his enemies as well as to his friends, would have put the truth of his re&s;urrection beyond all doubt, than which nothing could be more nece&s;&s;ary to the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity; and therefore, the &s;uppo&s;ition of his having confined his appearances, after his re&s;urrection, to a few &s;elect friends, renders the affair extremely &s;u&s;picious and unworthy of credit.'</P>
<P>THIS argument however plau&s;ible it may appear at fir&s;t &s;ight, is de&s;titute of the lea&s;t force; becau&s;e it may be demon&s;trated, that if JESUS had &s;hewed him&s;elf to his enemies, and to all the people in general, the&s;e appearances, in&s;tead of putting the truth of his re&s;urrection beyond all doubt, would have weakened the evidence of it, at lea&s;t in after-ages; and, con&s;equently, have been of infinite prejudice to mankind&mdash;for upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had &s;hewed him&s;elf openly, one of the&s;e two things mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have happened; either his enemies, &s;ubmitting to the evidence of their &s;en&s;es, would have believed his re&s;urrection, or, re&s;i&s;ting that evidence, they would re|ject it altogether. We &s;hall begin with taking the latter into con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>ITS very evident, that tho&s;e enemies of the great Redeemer of mankind, who re&s;i&s;ted the evidence of their &s;en&s;es, or who, though really convinced, would not acknowledge their conviction, mu&s;t have ju&s;tified their di&s;belief by affirming that the per&s;on who appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d to them, as ri&s;en from the dead, was not JESUS whom the Roman governor had crucified, but an impo&s;tor who per&s;onated him. On any other foundation their infidelity would have been ridiculous and ab&s;urd; but, if the unbelieving Jews, by our Lord's appearing per&s;onally to them, would have been laid under a nece&s;&s;ity of denying the reality of his re&s;urrection, even though per&s;uaded of it in their own minds, the evidence of fact could have gained nothing by &s;uch public appearances; becau&s;e the generality of the Jews were not capable of pa&s;&s;ing a judgment upon the fal&s;ehood which CHRIST's enemies mu&s;t have made u&s;e of to &s;upport their denial of his re&s;urrection, being unacquainted with JESUS, they could not certainly tell whether he was really the per&s;on whom the Romans had crucified. His apo&s;tles, di&s;ciples, and acquaintance, who, by their long attendance on him, knew his &s;tature, &s;hape, air, voice, and manner, were the only proper per&s;ons by who&s;e determination the point in di&s;pute could be decided; con&s;equently, if our Lord had appeared to all the people, if any con&s;iderable number of his enemies had continued in their infidelity, the whole &s;tre&s;s of the evidence of his re&s;urrection mu&s;t have wre&s;ted on the evidence of the very per&s;ons who according to the plan pitched upon by Providence, bear witne&s;s to it now, and upon who&s;e te&s;timony the world has believed it: &s;o that, in&s;tead of gaining an additional evidence by the pro|po&s;ed method, of &s;hewing JESUS publicly to all the people, we &s;hould have had nothing
<PB N="277" REF="029927_0296_0FE33A63493BC118">
to tru&s;t to but the te&s;timony of his di&s;ciples, and that clogged with the incumbrance, that his re&s;urrection was denied by many to whom he appeared, and who were not convinced by the te&s;timony of their &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that in ca&s;e our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had &s;hewed him&s;elf publicly, the whole nation of the Jews mu&s;t have believed, and that future gene|rations would thus have had the fulle&s;t evidence of the truth of his re&s;urrection, beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, this will not appear to be the ca&s;e, if we con&s;ider, that the greate&s;t part of our Lord's enemies having not given them&s;elves the trouble of attending him often, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;o well acquainted with his per&s;on as to know him with certainty; for which rea&s;on, though he had &s;hewed him&s;elf to them, even their belief of his re&s;urrection mu&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, have depended on the te&s;timony of his di&s;|ciples and friends: if &s;o, it is not very probable that his appearing publicly would have had any great effect on the Jews, to per&s;uade them to embrace a crucified Me&s;&s;iah. It is far more rea&s;onable to believe, that they would have rejected the whole, and con|tinued in their infidelity, unle&s;s a divine power interpo&s;ed to remove the veil from their hearts.</P>
<P>IN order to give the argument all the force the Dei&s;ts can de&s;ire, let us further &s;up|po&s;e, that, in con&s;equence of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's appearing to all the people of the Jews, the nation in general would have been convinced of the truth of his re&s;urrection, and become his di&s;ciples; what advantage would the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity have reaped from &s;uch effects of our Lord's public appearance? Would the evidence of his re&s;ur|rection have become thereby the more unque&s;tionable? or would the modern infidels have been the better di&s;po&s;ed to believe in this crucified JESUS? By no means: for we do not find that men of this cla&s;s are at all the more ready to believe the miracles of Mo&s;es in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the Wilderne&s;s, becau&s;e the whole nation were witne&s;&s;es of them. The truth is, had our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer per&s;uaded all the people of the Jews, by appearing per&s;onally to them, the objections again&s;t his re&s;urrection would have been ten times more numerous and forcible than they are at pre&s;ent; for would not the whole have been called a &s;tate-trick, a Jewi&s;h fable, a mere political con|trivance, to patch up their broken credit, after they had &s;o long talked of a Me&s;&s;iah, who was to come at that time? Be&s;ides, we &s;hould certainly have been told, that the government being engaged in the plot, a fraud of this kind might have ea&s;ily been carried on, e&s;pecially as the people in general would eagerly fall in with it; becau&s;e it was &s;o exactly adapted to their prejudices, and becau&s;e the few who had &s;agacity enough to detect the fraud, could have no opportunity of examining into it; or, if they did ex|amine and detect the fraud, would not have dared to make any di&s;covery of it, in oppo&s;ition to the whole weight of the &s;tate: &s;o that they would let it pa&s;s quietly, without once calling it in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>THE re&s;urrection of our great Redeemer univer&s;ally believed among&s;t the Jews, and publi&s;hed to the world by the unanimous voice of the nation would, to &s;ay the truth, have been liable to an infinite number of objections, which are all effectually cut off by the method made choice of by the wi&s;dom of Providence; for as the people in ge|neral, and the rulers in particular, continued in their infidelity, the per&s;ons concerned in this &s;uppo&s;ed fraud, mu&s;t have carried it on under the greate&s;t di&s;advantages. The rea&s;on is, that in&s;tead of making many friends to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, which a fraud of this kind requires, all men were their enemies, and intere&s;ted to di&s;cover the cheat. The Jewi&s;h rulers, in particular gave all po&s;&s;ible encouragement to make the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny into
<PB N="278" REF="029927_0297_0FE33A651373DFA8">
the fact, and into all its circum&s;tances; and many doubtle&s;s, zealou&s;ly made the inquiry with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s. The apo&s;tles who preached the re&s;urrection, expo&s;ed them|&s;elves to the fierce&s;t re&s;entment of the men in power; becau&s;e the re&s;urrection of our great Redeemer ca&s;t the greate&s;t reflection upon tho&s;e who had put him to death. It &s;hould al&s;o be remembered, that if the generality of the nation had not continued in their unbelief, the apo&s;tles, who preached the re&s;urrection, would not have &s;uffered the&s;e per|&s;ecutions, which in every country were rai&s;ed again&s;t them, chiefly by the Jews; and con|&s;equently one of the &s;tronge&s;t arguments for the truth of their te&s;timony would have been wanting: whereas, by their having been per&s;ecuted to death for their preaching the re&s;ur|rection of their great Ma&s;ter, they fully demon&s;trated how &s;incerely they believed the great fact which they preached, in continual jeopardy of their lives, notwith&s;tanding the virulent malice and re&s;tle&s;s per&s;ecution of their enemies.</P>
<P>WE have thus endeavoured to an&s;wer, in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t &s;atisfactory manner, the principal objection made by the Dei&s;ts again&s;t the truth of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's re|&s;urrection; and &s;hall conclude this chapter with a few reflections on the life of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS; a life the greate&s;t and be&s;t that was ever led by man, or was ever the &s;ubject of any hi&s;tory &s;ince the univer&s;e was called from its original chaos, by the power|ful word of the Almighty&punc; which &s;pake it into being.</P>
<P>AS the human character of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS re&s;ults from the accounts given of him by the evangeli&s;ts (for they have not formally drawn it up) &s;o it is entirely different from that of all other men what&s;oever; for whereas they have &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, deeply rooted in their brea&s;ts, and are influenced by them in almo&s;t every thing they do, JESUS was &s;o entirely free from them, that the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;crutiny cannot furni&s;h one &s;ingle action in the whole cour&s;e of his life wherein he con&s;ulted his own intere&s;t only: no, he was influenced by very different motives; the pre&s;ent happine&s;s and eternal welfare of &s;inners regulated his conduct; and while others followed their re&s;pective occupations, JESUS had no other bu&s;ine&s;s than that of promoting the happine&s;s of the &s;ons of men; nor did he wait till he was &s;olicited to extend his benevolent hand to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; he went about doing good, and always accounted it more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive; re&s;embling God rather than man, in every act of his life.</P>
<P>PERSONS of the mo&s;t exalted faculties are apt to be elated with &s;ucce&s;s and applau&s;e, or dejected by cen&s;ure and di&s;appointments: but the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS was never elevated by the one, nor depre&s;&s;ed by the other; he was never more courageous than when he met with the greate&s;t oppo&s;ition and cruel treatment, nor more humble than when the &s;ons of men wor&s;hipped at his feet. He came into the world in&s;pired with the grande&s;t purpo&s;e that ever was formed, that of &s;aving from eternal perdition, not a &s;ingle nation, but the whole world; and in the execution of it, went through the longe&s;t and heavie&s;t train of labours that ever was &s;u&s;tained, with a con&s;tancy and re&s;olution, on which no di&s;advantageous impre&s;&s;ion could be made by any accident whatever: calumny, threat|enings, bad &s;ucce&s;s, with many other evils con&s;tantly attending him, &s;erved only to quicken his endeavours in this glorious enterpri&s;e, which he unweariedly pur&s;ued, even till he fini&s;hed it by his death on the cro&s;s.</P>
<P>MANKIND are prone to retaliate injuries received, and &s;eem to take a &s;atisfaction in complaining of the cruelties of tho&s;e who oppre&s;s them; whereas, the whole of CHRIST's labours breathed nothing but meekne&s;s, patience, and forgivene&s;s, even to his bittere&s;t enemies, and in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t excruciating torments. The words <HI>Father, for|give them, for they know not what they do,</HI> uttered by him when his enemies were nailing
<PB N="279" REF="029927_0298_0FE33A66980356C0">
him to the cro&s;s, fitly expre&s;s the temper which he maintained through the whole cour&s;e of his life, even when a&s;&s;aulted by the heavie&s;t provocations. The truth is, he never &s;ignified, on any occa&s;ion, the lea&s;t re&s;entment by &s;peech or action, nor indeed any emo|tion of mind whatever, except &s;uch as flowed from pity and charity; con&s;equently &s;uch only as expre&s;&s;ed the deepe&s;t concern for the welfare of mankind, to which his glorious life and &s;ufferings effectually opened the way.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t and be&s;t men have had their failings, which tarni&s;h the lu&s;tre of their virtues, and &s;hew them to have been nothing more than men. This was the ca&s;e with Noah, Abraham, Mo&s;es, Job, David, Paul, and other heroes celebrated in hi&s;tory; but it was otherwi&s;e with JESUS; he was &s;uperior to all the men that ever lived, both with regard to the purity of his manners and the perfection of his virtues: he was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, and &s;eparated from &s;inners. Whether we con&s;ider him as a teacher, or as a man, <HI>he did not &s;in, neither was guile found in his mouth.</HI> 1 Pet. ii.22. His whole life was perfectly free from &s;pot or weakne&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the &s;ame time it was remarkable for the greate&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive exerci&s;es of virtue: but never to have committed the lea&s;t &s;in in word or in deed, never to have uttered any &s;entiment that could be cen&s;ured, upon the various topics of religion and morality, which were the daily &s;ubjects of his di&s;cour&s;es, and that through the cour&s;e of a life filled with the action, and led under the ob&s;ervation of many enemies, who had always acce&s;s to conver&s;e with him, and who often came to find fault, is a pitch of perfection evidently above the reach of human nature, and, con&s;equently, he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, mu&s;t have been divine, and a mo&s;t perfect Being.</P>
<P>This adorable Per&s;on is the &s;ubject of the evangelical hi&s;tory. If the reader, by reviewing his life, doctrine, and miracles, as they are here repre&s;ented to him united in one &s;eries, has a clearer idea of the&s;e things than before, or ob&s;erves a beauty in his actions thus linked together, which taken &s;eparately, do not appear &s;o fully; if he feels him&s;elf touched by the character of JESUS in general, or with any of his &s;ermons and actions in particular, thus &s;imply delineated in writing, who&s;e principal charms are the beauties of truth; above all, if his dying &s;o generou&s;ly for men, &s;trikes him with admi|ration, or fills him with joy, in the pro&s;pect of that pardon which is hereby purcha&s;ed for the world; let him &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider with him&s;elf, what improvement he ought to make of the divine goodne&s;s, what returns of prai&s;e and gratitude due from him.</P>
<P>THE Saviour of mankind, by his death, has &s;et open the gates of immortality to all the po&s;terity of Adam; and by his word, &s;pirit, and example, graciou&s;ly offers to make them meet for the glorious rewards in the kingdom of the heavenly Canaan, and to conduct them into the inheritance of the &s;aints in light: let us, therefore, remember, that, being born under the di&s;pen&s;ation of his go&s;pel, we have, from our earlie&s;t years, enjoyed the be&s;t means of acquiring wi&s;dom, virtue, and happine&s;s, the lineaments of the image of God. We have been called to a&s;pire after an exaltation to the nature and felicity of the Almighty exhibited to mortal eyes in the man CHRIST JESUS, to fire us with the noble&s;t ambition. His go&s;pel teaches us that we are made for eternity; and that our pre&s;ent life is to our future exi&s;tence, as infancy is to manhood: but as in the former, many things are to be learned, many hard&s;hips to be endured, many habits to be ac|quired, and that by a tedious cour&s;e of exerci&s;es, which in them&s;elves though painful, and po&s;&s;ibly u&s;ele&s;s to the child, yet are nece&s;&s;ary to fit him for the bu&s;ine&s;s and enjoy|ments of manhood; &s;o while we remain in this infancy of human life, things are to be learned, hard&s;hips to be endured, and habits to be acquired by a laborious cour&s;e of di&s;cipline, which however painful, mu&s;t be under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, becau&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to fit us for

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Ob&s;ervations on the Doctrine of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour: The Excellency of the Religion he enforced and inculcated: And the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of, and Plea&s;ure re&s;ulting from, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Chri&s;tian Life.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE cannot more properly conclude our hi&s;tory of the life of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, the author and fini&s;her of our faith, nor place the great doctrines taught by the benevolent Son of the Mo&s;t High, in a more con&s;picuous light, than by removing a few prejudices which &s;ome, we fear too many, have formed again&s;t the religion of the holy JESUS, and &s;hew that his yoke is ea&s;y, and his burden is light.</P>
<P>THERE have not, perhaps, been greater enemies to the progre&s;s of religion, than tho&s;e who deleniate it in a gloomy and terrifying form; nor any guilty of a more injurious calumny again&s;t the go&s;pel, than tho&s;e who repre&s;ent its precepts as rigorous impo&s;i|tions and unnece&s;&s;ary re&s;traints. True religion is the perfection of human nature, and the foundation of uniform exalted plea&s;ure, of public order and private happi|ne&s;s. Chri&s;tianity is the mo&s;t excellent and the mo&s;t u&s;eful in&s;titution, having the pro|mi&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come; it is the voice of rea&s;on; it is al&s;o the language of Scripture; the ways of wi&s;dom <HI>are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths are peace.</HI> Prov. iii.17. And our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf a&s;&s;ures us, that his pre|cepts are ea&s;y, and the burden of his religion light and plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>THE religion which CHRIST came into this lower world to e&s;tabli&s;h, is a rational &s;er|vice, a wor&s;hip in &s;pirit and truth, a wor&s;hip worthy of the maje&s;ty of the Almighty to receive, and of the nature of man to pay. One of its important branches is natural religion&punc; reinforced by additional motives and new di&s;coveries: its po&s;itive rights are few, of plain and ea&s;y &s;ignificancy, and manife&s;tly adopted to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;en&s;e of moral obligations. The go&s;pel places religion not in ab&s;truce &s;peculation and metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtilties; not in outward &s;hew and tedious ceremony; not in &s;uper&s;titious au&s;terities and enthu&s;ia&s;tic vi&s;ion, but in purity of heart, and holine&s;s of life. The &s;um of our duty, according to our great Ma&s;ter him&s;elf, con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>love of God,</HI> and <HI>of our neighbour;</HI> according to St. Paul, in <HI>denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts;</HI> and in <HI>living &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world:</HI> according to St. James, in <HI>vi&s;iting the fatherle&s;s and widows in affliction,</HI> and in <HI>keeping our&s;elves un&s;potted from the world.</HI> This is the con&s;tant &s;train and tenor of the go&s;pel; this it inculcates mo&s;t earne&s;tly, and on this it lays the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s, as mo&s;t conducive to true and &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IF it be a&s;ked, whether the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem is only a republication of the law of na|ture, or merely a refined &s;y&s;tem of morality? We reply, No certainly; it is a great deal more. It is an act of grace, a &s;tupendous plan of Providence, de&s;igned for the reco|very of mankind from a &s;tate of degradation and ruin, to the favour of the Almighty, and to the hopes of a happy immortality through a Mediator. Under this di&s;pen&s;a|tion, true religion con&s;i&s;ts in a repentance towards God, and in faith in the Lord JESUS
<PB N="281" REF="029927_0300_0FE33A6F1E82E1F0">
CHRIST, as the per&s;on appointed by the &s;upreme authority of heaven and earth, to reconcile apo&s;tate man to his offended Creator, as a &s;acrifice for &s;in; our vital head, and governing Lord. This is the religion of Chri&s;tians; and what hard&s;hip, what ex|action is there in all this? Surely none: nay, the practice of religion is much ea&s;ier than the &s;ervitude of &s;in, which at be&s;t is the vile&s;t drudgery, and yields the wor&s;t kind of wages.</P>
<P>ALL will readily agree, that our rational powers are impaired, and the &s;oul weak|ened by &s;in; the animal pa&s;&s;ions are &s;trong and apt to oppo&s;e the dictates of rea&s;on; objects of &s;en&s;e, make powerful impre&s;&s;ions on the mind; we are in every &s;ituation, &s;urrounded with many &s;nares and temptations: in &s;uch a di&s;ordered &s;tate of things, to main|tain a cour&s;e of &s;trict piety and uncorrupted virtue, is a work of great difficulty. There are, however, many tender propen&s;ions and generous in&s;tincts interwoven with our very being, as re&s;traints from vice, and incitements to virtue. The gracious Author of nature has planted in the human brea&s;t, a quick &s;en&s;e of good and evil; a faculty which &s;trongly dictates right and wrong; and, though, by the &s;trength of appetite and warmth of pa&s;&s;ion, men are often hurried into immoral practices; yet in the beginning, e&s;pecially when there has been the advantage of a good education, it is u&s;ually with reluctance and oppo&s;ition of mind. What inward &s;truggles precede, what bitter pangs attend their &s;inful exce&s;&s;es! What guilty blu&s;hes and unea&s;y fears! What frightful pro&s;pects and pale reviews! 'Terrors are upon them, and a fire not blown con&s;umeth them.' To make a mock at &s;in, and to commit iniquity without remor&s;e, is an attain|ment that requires length of time, and much painful labour; more labour than is requi&s;ite to attain that habitual goodne&s;s which is the glory of the man, the ornament of the Chri&s;tian, his preparation for heaven, and the chief &s;ource of his happine&s;s there. The &s;oul can no more be reconciled to flagrant acts of wickedne&s;s and inju&s;tice, than the body to exce&s;s, without &s;uffering many bitter pains and cruel attacks, attacks attended with much angui&s;h and vexation of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>CONSCIENCE may indeed be &s;topped and put to &s;ilence for a while by fal&s;e principles, its &s;ecret whi&s;pers may be drowned by the noi&s;e of company, and &s;tifled by entertainments of &s;en&s;e; but this principle of con&s;cience is &s;o deeply rooted in human nature, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ame time, her voice is &s;o clear and &s;trong, that all the &s;inner's arts will be unable to lull her into a la&s;ting &s;ecurity. When the hour of calamity arrives, when &s;ickne&s;s &s;eizeth, and death approacheth the &s;inner, con&s;cience con&s;trains him to li&s;ten to her accu&s;ations, and will not &s;uffer the temples of his head to take any re&s;t: <HI>There is no peace for the wicked;</HI> the foundations of peace are &s;ubverted, they are at utter enmity with their rea&s;on, with their con&s;cience, and with the God of their mercies.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is far otherwi&s;e with true religion: con&s;cience is on her &s;ide: rea&s;on pleads for her, and intere&s;t joins in the recommendation. When religion pure and genuine forms the temper, and governs the life, con&s;cience applauds, and peace takes her re&s;i|dence in the brea&s;t: the &s;oul is in its proper &s;tate, there is order and regularity both in the faculties and actions. Con&s;cious of its own integrity, and &s;ecure of the divine approbation, the &s;oul enjoys a calmne&s;s not to be de&s;cribed: but why do I call this happy frame calmne&s;s only? It is far more than mere calmne&s;s: the air may be calm, and the day overca&s;t with thick mi&s;ts and dark clouds: the pious and virtuous mind re&s;embles a &s;erene day, enlighted and enlivened with the brighte&s;t rays of the &s;un; though all without may be clouds and darkne&s;s&punc; there is light in the heart of a pious man; he is &s;atisfied from him&s;elf, and is filled with peace and joy in believing: in the concluding &s;cene, the awful moment of di&s;&s;olution, all is peaceful and &s;erene. The immortal part quit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> its tenement of clay with the well-grounded hopes of a&s;cending to happine&s;s and glory, without mixture, and without end.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="029927_0301_0FE33A71637CBB68">THE go&s;pel enjoins no duty but what is fit and rea&s;onable: it calls upon all its pro|fe&s;&s;ors to practi&s;e reverence, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and gratitude to God; ju&s;tice, truth, and uni|ver&s;al benevolence to men; and to maintain the government of our own minds: and what has any one to &s;ubject again&s;t this? From the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t commandment of our dear Redeemer, there is not one which impartial rea&s;on can find fault with; his law is perfect; his precepts are true, and righteous altogether. Not even tho&s;e excepted, which require us to love our enemies, to deny our&s;elves, and to take up our cro&s;s. To forgive an injury is more generous and manly than to revenge it; to controul a licentious appetite than to indulge it: to &s;uffer poverty, reproach, and even death it&s;elf, in the &s;acred cau&s;e of truth and integrity, is much wi&s;er and better, than, by ba&s;e compliances, to make &s;hipwreck of faith and a good con&s;cience. Thus in a &s;torm at &s;ea, or a confla|gration on the land, a man with plea&s;ure abandons his lumber to &s;ecure his jewels: piety and virtue are the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t rea&s;onable things in the world, vice and wickedne&s;s the mo&s;t irrational, ab&s;urd, and pernicious.</P>
<P>THE infinitely wi&s;e Author of our being hath &s;o framed our natures, and placed us in &s;uch relations, that there is nothing vicious but what is injurious; nothing virtuous but what is advantageous to our pre&s;ent intere&s;t, both with re&s;pect to body and mind. Meekne&s;s and humility, patience and univer&s;al charity, are graces which give a joy unknown to tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors. The divine virtues of truth and equity are the only bands of friend&s;hip, the only &s;upports of &s;ociety. Temperance and &s;obriety are the be&s;t pre&s;ervatives of health and &s;trength; but &s;in and debauchery impair the body, con&s;ume the &s;ub&s;tance, reduce to po|verty, and form the direct path to an immature and untimely death. Now this is the chief excellency of all laws; and what will always render their burden plea&s;ant and delightful is, that they enjoin nothing unbecoming or injurious; but, on the contrary, what is pro|fitable, and of a &s;alutary nature.</P>
<P>BESIDES, to render our duty ea&s;y, we have the example as well as the commands of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS. The ma&s;ters of morality among&s;t the Heathens gave excellent rules for regulation of men's manners; but they wanted either the hone&s;ty or the courage to try their own arguments upon them&s;elves. It was a &s;trong pre&s;umption that the yoke of the &s;cribes and Phari&s;ees was grievous, when they laid heavy burdens upon men's &s;houlders, which they them&s;elves refu&s;ed to touch with one of their fingers. Not thus our great lawgiver, JESUS CHRIST the righteous; his behaviour was, in all re&s;pects, conformable to his doctrine; his devotion towards God, how &s;ublime and ardent! benevolence towards men, how great and diffu&s;ive? He was in his life an exact pattern of innocence: for he <HI>did not &s;in, neither was guile found in his mouth.</HI> In the Son of God incarnate is exhibited the brighte&s;t, the faire&s;t re&s;emblance of the Father, that earth or heaven ever beheld: an example peculiarly per&s;ua&s;ive, calculated to in&s;pire re&s;olution, and to animate us to u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeavours to imitate the divine pattern, the exam|ple of the author and fini&s;her of our faith, of him who loved us, and gave him&s;elf for us. Our profe&s;&s;ion and character as Chri&s;tians oblige us to make this example the model of our lives. Every motive of decency, gratitude and intere&s;t, con&s;trains us to tread the paths he trod before us, more e&s;pecially when we reflect that it was marked out to us by Unerring Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>LET us al&s;o remember, that our burden is ea&s;y; becau&s;e God, who knoweth whereof we are made, who con&s;idereth that we are but du&s;t, is ever ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t us. The hea|then &s;ages them&s;elves had had &s;ome notions of this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, though guided only by a glimmering lamp of rea&s;on; but what they looked upon as probable, the go&s;pel clearly and &s;trongly a&s;&s;erts. We there hear the apo&s;tle exhorting, <HI>Let us come boldly unto the
<PB N="283" REF="029927_0302_0FE33A72E92468E0">
throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in the time of need.</HI> Heb. iv.16. We there hear the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS him&s;elf arguing in this convincing manner, <HI>If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more &s;hall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that a&s;k him?</HI> Luke ix.13.</P>
<P>WE would not here be under&s;tood to mean, that the agency of the &s;pirit is irre&s;i&s;tible, and lays a nece&s;&s;itating bia&s;s on all the faculties and affections. Were this the ca&s;e, precepts and prohibitions, promi&s;es and threatenings, would &s;ignify nothing; and duty and obligation would be words without a meaning. The &s;pirit a&s;&s;i&s;teth in a manner agreeable to the frame of human nature; not controlling the free u&s;e of rea&s;on, but by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the under&s;tanding, influencing the will, and moderat|ing the affections; but though we may not be able to explain the mode of his operations, the Scriptures warrant us to a&s;&s;ert, that, when men are renewed and prepared for heaven, it is through &s;anctification of the &s;pirit, and belief of the truth. How enlivening the thought! how encouraging the motive! We are not left to &s;truggle alone with the diffi|culties which attend the practice of virtue in the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate. The merciful Father of our &s;pirits is ever near to help our infirmities, to enlighten the under&s;tanding, to &s;trengthen good re&s;olutions, and, in concurrence with our own endeavours, to make us conquerors over all oppo&s;ition. Faithful is he to his promi&s;es and will not &s;uffer the &s;incere and well di&s;po&s;ed to be tempted above what they are able to bear. What can be de&s;ired more than this? To promote the virtue and happine&s;s of his moral offspring, the Supreme Parent hath done all that is con&s;i&s;tent with the holine&s;s of his nature, and the free agency of man: if then we are not virtuous and happy, it is our own faults, and we are utterly inexcu&s;able, in refu&s;ing the grace and mercy proffered in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>LET us al&s;o remember, that the great doctrine of the go&s;pel concerning the propitious mercy of God to all the penitents through CHRIST JESUS, greatly contributes to the ea&s;e and plea&s;ure of a religious life. Let it be granted, that the hope of pardon is e&s;&s;ential to the religion of fallen creatures, and one of its fir&s;t principles; yet, con&s;idering the doubts and &s;u&s;picions which are apt to ari&s;e in a mind con&s;cious of guilt, it is undoubtedly a great and ine&s;timable favour, to be relieved in this re&s;pect by a me&s;&s;enger from Omni|potence him&s;elf. This is our happine&s;s: we are not left to depend upon con&s;equential rea&s;onings, which the bulk of manking are little u&s;ed to; but we are a&s;&s;ured, that upon our true repentance, we &s;hall, through the mediation of CHRIST, receive the full re|mi&s;&s;ion of pa&s;t &s;ins, and be re&s;tored to the &s;ame &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate and favour with our Maker, as if we had never tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his laws; here the go&s;pel triumphs: with the&s;e a&s;&s;urances it abounds; upon this head the declarations of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour and his apo&s;tles are &s;o expre&s;s and full that every one who believes them, and knows him&s;elf to be a true peni|tent, mu&s;t bani&s;h every doubt and fear, and rejoice with joy un&s;peakable: <HI>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t,</HI> Mat. xi.28. <HI>All manner of &s;in and bla&s;phemy &s;hall be forgiven unto men,</HI> ch, xii.31. <HI>Be it known unto you, men and bre|thren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins; and by him all that believe are ju&s;tified from all things, from which ye could not be ju&s;tified by the law of Mo&s;es,</HI> Acts xiii.38, 39. <HI>The blood of Je&s;us clean&s;eth from all &s;in,</HI> John i.7. What grace and favour is this! Who can dwell upon the tran&s;porting theme too long! Now our way is plain before us, and the burden we are to bear is made ea&s;y. No &s;ins are unpardonable, if repented of and for&s;aken; for it is &s;aid &s;uch &s;hall find mercy.</P>
<P>YOU who have never yet regarded religion, but pur&s;ued a cour&s;e of vice and &s;en&s;uality all your lives long, are earne&s;tly entreated to con&s;ider, that, though your conduct has been ba&s;e to the la&s;t degree, your ca&s;e is not de&s;perate, far from it: the God whom you

<P>WHAT &s;till further conduces to render the Chi&s;tian religion ea&s;y and delightful is its leading us to the perfect, eternal life of heaven. It cannot be denied but that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> draw from the light of nature &s;trong pre&s;umptions of a future &s;tate; the pre&s;ent exi&s;tence does not look like an entire &s;cene, but rather like the infancy of human nature, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> capable of arriving at a much higher degree of maturity: but whatever &s;olid foundation the doctrine of a future &s;tate may have in nature and rea&s;on, certain it is, that through the habitual neglect of reflection, and the force of irregular pa&s;&s;ions, this doctrine w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, before the coming of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, very much disfigured, and, in a great mea|&s;ure lo&s;t among&s;t the &s;ons of men, &s;ome of whom affirmed, that there was neither re&s;ur|rection, angel, or &s;pirit.</P>
<P>A future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments was a matter of mere &s;peculation and uncer|tainty in the heathen world; it was &s;ometimes hoped for, &s;ometimes doubted of, and &s;ometimes ab&s;olutely denied. The law of Mo&s;es, though of divine original, is chiefly enforced by promi&s;es of temporal ble&s;&s;ings; and, even in the writings of the prophets, a fu|ture immortality is very &s;paringly mentioned, and ob&s;curely repre&s;ented: but the doctrine of our Saviour hath <HI>brought life and immortality to light.</HI> In the go&s;pel we have a di&s;tinct account of another world, attended with many engaging circum&s;tances, about which the deci&s;ions of rea&s;on were dark and confu&s;ed. We have the te&s;timony of the Author of our religion, who was rai&s;ed from the dead, and who afterwards, in the pre&s;ence of his di&s;ciples, a&s;cended into heaven. In the New Te&s;tament it is expre&s;sly declared, that good men, <HI>when ab&s;ent from the body, are pre&s;ent with the Lord.</HI> Here we are a&s;&s;ured of the re&s;urrection of the body in a glorious form, clothed with immortal vigour, &s;uited to the active nature of the animating &s;pirit, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting its mo&s;t enlarged operations and ince&s;&s;ant progre&s;s towards perfection. Here we are a&s;&s;ured, that <HI>the righteous &s;hall go into life everla&s;ting;</HI> that they &s;hall enter into the kingdom of the heavenly Canaan, where no ignorance &s;hall cloud the under&s;tanding, no vice di&s;turb the will. In the&s;e regions of perfection, nothing but love &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;oul; nothing but gratitude employ the tongue: there the righteous &s;hall be united <HI>to an innumerable company of angels, and to the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t born:</HI> there they &s;hall &s;ee their exalted Redeemer at the right hand of Omnipotence, and &s;it down with him on his throne; t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re they &s;hall be admitted into the immediate pre&s;ence of the Supreme Fountain of life and happine&s;s, and, beholding his face, be changed into the &s;ame image from glory to glory.&mdash;Here language&mdash;here imagination fails me! It requires the genius, the knowledge, and the pen of an angel, to paint the happine&s;s, the bli&s;sful &s;cene of the new Jeru&s;alem, which human eyes cannot behold till this mortal body &s;hall be purified from its corruption and dre&s;&s;ed in the robes of immortality; <HI>Eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart</HI> to conceive the joys <HI>which God hath prepared for them that love him.</HI>&mdash;What is the Ely&s;ium of the Heathens, compared with the heaven of the Chri&s;tians? The hope, the pro&s;pect of this is &s;ufficient to reconcile us to all the difficulties that may attend our progre&s;s, &s;weeten all our labours, alleviate every grief, and &s;ilence every murmur, by impre&s;&s;ing on our minds a meek acquie&s;cence with the divine di&s;pen&s;ations in the cour&s;e of his providence.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="029927_0304_0FE33A7E60A86D88">BUT the libertine, in the gaiety of his heart, may po&s;&s;ibly enquire, why there &s;hould be any difficulties, or re&s;traint at all?

The appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> he hath planted in the human brea&s;t are to be gratified: to deny, or to re&s;train them, is ignominious bondage; but to give full &s;cope to every de&s;ire and pa&s;&s;ion of the heart, without check or controul, is true manly freedom, and only pur&s;uing the dictates of nature.</P>
<P>IN order to confute and expo&s;e this loo&s;e and carele&s;s way of rea&s;oning, let it be con|&s;idered, that the liberty of a rational creature doth not con&s;i&s;t in an entire exemption from all controul, but in following the dictates of rea&s;on as the governing principle, and in keeping the various pa&s;&s;ions in due &s;ubordination. To follow the regular motion of tho&s;e affections which the wi&s;e Creator hath implanted within us, is our duty: but as our natural de&s;ires in this &s;tate of trial are often irregular, we are bound to re&s;train their exce&s;&s;es, and not to indulge them, but in a &s;trict &s;ub&s;erviency to the integrity and peace of our minds, and to the order and happine&s;s of human &s;ociety e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world. They who allow the &s;upreme command to be u&s;urped by &s;en&s;e and brutal appetite, may promi&s;e them&s;elves liberty, but are truly and ab&s;olutely the &s;ervants of corruption: to be vicious is to be en&s;laved. We behold with pity tho&s;e mi&s;erable ob|jects that are chained in the gallies, or confined in dark pri&s;ons and loath&s;ome dungeons; but much more abject and vile is the &s;lavery of the &s;inner! No &s;lavery of the body is equal to the bondage of the mind: no chains pre&s;s &s;o clo&s;ely or gall &s;o cruelly as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etters of &s;in, which corrode the very &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;oul, fret every faculty, and de|grade men below the brute part of the creation.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t indeed confe&s;s, that there are &s;ome profligates &s;o hardened by cu&s;tom, as to be pa&s;t all feeling; and, becau&s;e in&s;en&s;ible of their bondage, boa&s;t of this in&s;en&s;ibility as a mark of their native freedom, and their happine&s;s. Vain men! they might extol, with equal propriety, the peculiar happine&s;s of an apoplexy, the profound tranquility of a lethergy, or, we may add, the ideal paradi&s;e of a fool or a mad-man.</P>
<P>WE have, in the foregoing ob&s;ervations, endeavoured to place in a plain and con&s;pi|cuous light, &s;ome of the peculiar excellencies of the Chri&s;tian religion; and from hence many u&s;eful reflections will naturally ari&s;e in the mind of every attentive reader. It is the religion of JESUS that hath removed idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition, and brought immor|tality to light, when concealed under a veil of darkne&s;s almo&s;t impenetrable. This hath &s;et the great truths of religion in a clear and con&s;picuous point of view, and propo&s;ed new and powerful motives to influence our minds, and to determine our conduct. No|thing is enjoined to be believed, but what is worthy of God; nothing to be practi&s;ed but what is friendly to man. All the doctrines of the go&s;pel are rational and con&s;i&s;tent; all its precepts are truly wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and good. The go&s;pel contains nothing grievous to an ingenious mind; it debars us from nothing but doing harm to our&s;elves or to our fellow creatures; and permits us to range any where but in the paths of danger and de|&s;truction. It only requires us to act up to the dignity of the rational nature, and to prefer to the vani&s;hing plea&s;ures of &s;in, the &s;miles of a reconciled God, and an eternal weight of glory: and is this a rigorous exaction, a heavy burden not be endured? How can &s;inful mortals harbour a thought &s;o ridiculous and unworthy?</P>
<P>CAN any man who is a real friend to the cau&s;e of virtue, and to the intere&s;t of man|kind, ever be an enemy to Chri&s;tianity if he truly under&s;tands it, and &s;eriou&s;ly reflects on its wi&s;e and u&s;eful tendency? Impo&s;&s;ible, for it conducteth us to our journey's end by the plaine&s;t and &s;ecure&s;t path, where the &s;teps are not &s;traightened, and where he that runneth &s;tumbleth not. Let us who live under this la&s;t, and mo&s;t gracious di&s;pen&s;ation

Let us &s;hew that we are Chri&s;tians in deed and in truth; not by endle&s;s di&s;putes about trifles, and the tran&s;|ports of a blind zeal, but by practi&s;ing that univer&s;al, that exalted goodne&s;s, our holy religion recommends, and by abounding in tho&s;e <HI>fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s which are by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, unto the glory and prai&s;e of God.</HI> Phil. i.11.</P>
<P>WE may clearly perceive, from what has been &s;aid, how groundle&s;s all tho&s;e prejudices are which &s;ome conceive again&s;t religion, as if it was a peevi&s;h, moro&s;e &s;cheme, burden|&s;ome to human nature, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the true enjoyment of life. Such &s;entiments are too apt to prevail in the heat of youth, when the &s;pirits are bri&s;k and lively, and the pa&s;&s;ions warm and impetuous: but it is wholly a mi&s;take, and a mi&s;take of the mo&s;t dangerous tendency. The truth is, there is no plea&s;ure like that of a good con&s;cience, no real peace but what re&s;ults from the practice of virtue; this ennobles the mind, and can alone &s;upport it under all the various and unequal &s;cenes of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of trial; this lays a &s;ure foundation of an ea&s;y, comfortable life, of a &s;erene, peaceful death, and of eternal joy and happine&s;s hereafter: whereas vice is ruinous to all our mo&s;t valu|able intere&s;ts; it &s;poils the native beauty, and &s;ubverts the order of the &s;oul; it renders us the &s;corn of man, the rejected of God, and, without timely repentance, will rob us of a happy eternity. Religion is the health, the liberty, and the happine&s;s of the &s;oul; &s;in is the di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;ervitude, and de&s;truction of it, both here and for ever.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e arguments be not &s;ufficient to convince you, let me lead you into the cham|ber of an habitual rioter, the lewd debauchee, worn out in the cau&s;e of iniquity, his bones full of the &s;ins of his youth, that from his own mouth, as he lies on his expiring bed, you may learn that the way of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is hard; and that however &s;weet &s;in may be in the commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>it biteth like a &s;erpent, and &s;tingeth like an adder.</HI> Prov. xxiii.32. This awful truth is exemplified in a very &s;trong point of view, by the late celebrated Dr. Young, in his <HI>Centaur not Fabulous,</HI> page 149&mdash;161, where he draw a mo&s;t awful picture of the la&s;t &s;cene of an abandoned profligate, who had di&s;pi&s;ed religion, and led a life of plea&s;ure and di&s;&s;ipation.

I could not) he, with a mo&s;t affectionate look, &s;aid, "Keep the&s;e tears for thy&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lf. I have undone thee.&mdash;Do&s;t thou weep for me? That's cruel. What can pain me more?"</P>
<P>"Here his friend too much affected, would have left him.</P>
<P>"No, &s;tay. Thou &s;till may'&s;t hope;&mdash;therefore hear me. How madly have I talked? How madly ha&s;t thou li&s;tened and believed? But look on my pre&s;ent &s;tate as a full an&s;wer to thee and to my&s;elf. This body is all weakne&s;s and pain; but my &s;oul, as if &s;tung up by torment, to greater &s;trength and &s;pirit, is full powerful to rea&s;on; full mighty to &s;uffer. And that which thus triumphs within the jaws of mortality, is doubtle&s;s immor|tal. And as for a Deity, nothing le&s;s than an Almighty could inflict the pains I feel."</P>
<P>"I was about to congratulate this pa&s;&s;ive, involuntary confe&s;&s;ion, in his a&s;&s;erting the two prime articles of his creed, extorted by the rack of nature: when he thus very pa&s;|&s;ionately added, "No, no! let me &s;peak on.&mdash;I have not long to &s;peak.&mdash;My much in|jured friend! my &s;oul as my body, lies, in ruins, in &s;cattered fragments of broken thought: remor&s;e for the pa&s;t throws my thoughts on the future: wor&s;e dread of the future &s;trikes it back on the pa&s;t. I turn, and turn, and find no ray.&mdash;Did&s;t thou feel half the mountain that is on me, thou would&s;t &s;truggle with the martyr for his &s;take, and ble&s;s heaven for the flames;&mdash;that is not an everla&s;ting flame; that is not an unquench|able fire."</P>
<P>"How were we &s;truck? Yet, &s;oon after &s;till more. With what an eye of di&s;traction what a face of de&s;pair he cried out, "My principles have poi&s;oned my friend; my extra|vagance has beggared my boy; my unkindne&s;s has murdered my wife! And is there another hell? Oh! thou bla&s;phemed, yet mo&s;t indulgent Lord God! Hell it&s;elf is a refuge if it hides me from thy frown.&mdash;"</P>
<P>"SOON after, his under&s;tanding failed; his terrified imagination uttered horrors not to be repeated, or ever forgotten; and before the &s;un (which I hope has &s;een few like him) aro&s;e, this gay, young, noble, ingenuous, accompli&s;hed, and mo&s;t wretched mortal, expired."</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes happens, we confe&s;s, that men who have led very wicked lives have gone out of the world, as they lived in it defying con&s;cience, and deriding a future judgment as an idle fiction: but the&s;e in&s;tances are very rare, and only prove that there are mon|&s;ters in the moral as well as in the natural world, who have &s;ported with their own deceivings, and have even dared to lift their puny and rebellious arm again&s;t Omnipotence.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="029927_0307_0FE33A82EDCEE9D8">BUT it will perhaps be &s;aid, that the &s;ons of vice and riot have plea&s;ure in &s;en&s;ual indulgences. Allowed: but it is altogether of the lower kind, empty, fleeting, and tran|&s;ient; like the crackling of thorns under a pot, &s;o is the mirth of the wicked. It makes a noi&s;e and a blaze for the pre&s;ent but &s;oon vani&s;hes away into &s;moke and vapour. On the other hand, the plea&s;ure of religion is &s;olid and la&s;ting, and will attend us through all, even the la&s;t &s;tages of life. When we have pa&s;&s;ed the levity of youth, and have lo&s;t our reli&s;h for the gay entertainments of &s;en&s;e; when old age &s;teals upon us, and bends us towards the grave, this will cleave fa&s;t to us, and give us relief. It will be &s;o far from terminating at death, that it then commences perfect, and continually improves with new additions, and ever-blooming joys.</P>
<P>IF our &s;ouls are clad in this immortal robe, we need not fear the awful &s;ummons of the king of terrors, nor regret our retiring into the chambers of the du&s;t. Our immortal part will wing its way to the arms of its Omnipotent Redeemer, and find re&s;t in the heavenly man&s;ions of the Almighty. And though our earthly part, this tabernacle of clay, return to its original du&s;t, it is only to be rai&s;ed in a more beautiful and heavenly form. If it retires into the &s;hadow of death, and vi&s;its the gloomy habitations of the grave, it is only to return from a &s;hort confinement to endle&s;s liberty: for our great Ma&s;ter will lead his redeemed from the chambers of the grave, and guide them in his &s;trength to his holy habitation: he will plant them in the mountain of his inheritance, in the place he hath prepared for them, even the &s;anctuary which his hands hath e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; and we &s;hall be with the Lord for ever and ever, to &s;erve him day and night in his temple, where the inhabitant &s;hall never &s;ay, I am &s;ick; where the wicked &s;hall cea&s;e from troubling, and where the weary &s;oul, will be for ever at re&s;t.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall here &s;ubjoin a copy of a letter, &s;ent by Publius Lentulus, governor of Judea, to the &s;enate of Rome, re&s;pecting the per&s;on and action of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour, JESUS CHRIST; which may &s;erve as a &s;trong te&s;timony and evidence in favour of the divinity of our Lord's per&s;on and doctrines again&s;t the &s;tale objections of the Dei&s;ts, as the authenticity of the ancient manu&s;cripts, from which it was tran&s;lated, is founded on the be&s;t authority. Tiberius Cae&s;ar was then emperor, and cau&s;ed the extraordinary intelli|gence, contained in this letter, to be publi&s;hed throughout all the Roman provinces. One would have thought this confirmation, i&s;&s;ued by the Roman governor, might have con|vinced the generality of the Romans, as well as Jews, concerning the divinity of our Lord's mi&s;&s;ion; but &s;uch was the univer&s;al prejudice of the people, that nothing would &s;atisfy tho&s;e who had not given credit to the words of CHRIST him&s;elf. The epi&s;tle runs as follows:</P>
<P>"THERE appeared in the&s;e our days a man of great virtue, named JESUS CHRIST, who is yet living among&s;t us, and of the Gentiles is accepted as a Prophet of Truth, but by his own di&s;ciples called the SON of GOD.

A man of &s;tature &s;omewhat tall and comely, with a very reverend countenance, &s;uch as the beholders may both <HI>love</HI> and <HI>fear:</HI> his hair is of the colour of a filbert full ripe, and plain almo&s;t down to his ears, but from his ears downward &s;omewhat curled, more orient of colour, and waving about his &s;houlders.

<DIV2 TYPE="biography">
<HEAD>THE LIFE OF ST. MATTHEW, The EVANGELIST and APOSTLE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS evangeli&s;t was al&s;o called Levi, and, though a Roman officer, was a true He|brew, and probably a Galilean. Kir&s;ten, an Arabian author, tells us, that he was born at Nazareth, a city in the tribe of Zebulon, famous for the habitation of Jo&s;eph and Mary, and the place where our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour re&s;ided the whole time of his pri|vate life. St. Matthew was the &s;on of Alpheus and Mary, &s;i&s;ter, or kin&s;woman, to the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, both originally de&s;cended from the tribe of I&s;&s;achar.</P>
<P>THE occupation of Matthew was that of a publican, or tax-gatherer to the Romans, an office dete&s;ted by the generality of the Jews. Among&s;t the Romans, indeed, it was accounted a place of power and credit, and, as &s;uch, rarely conferred on any but Ro|man knights: and T. Fl. Sabimus, father of the emperor Ve&s;pa&s;ian, was the publican of the A&s;ian provinces, an office which he di&s;charged &s;o greatly to the &s;atisfaction of the public, that they erected &s;tatues to him. The&s;e officers being &s;ent into the provinces to gather the tributes, generally employed the natives under them, as per&s;ons be&s;t &s;killed in the affairs and cu&s;toms of their own country.</P>
<P>ON two accounts, this office was odious to the Jews. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e the per&s;ons who managed it were generally covetous and great exactors; for having them&s;elves farmed the cu&s;toms of the Romans, they u&s;ed every method of oppre&s;&s;ion, in order to pay their rents to the Romans and procure an advantage to them&s;elves. Of this Zaccheus, the chief of the&s;e farmers, was very &s;en&s;ible after his conver&s;ion, when he offered to make a fourfold re&s;titution to all from whom he had taken any thing by fraud and extortion. And upon this account they became infamous, even among&s;t the Gentiles them&s;elves, who commonly mention them as public robbers, and, though members of the commu|nity, were more voracious and de&s;tructive in a city, than wild bea&s;ts in a fore&s;t. The other particular which rendered them &s;o hateful to the Jews, was the tribute they de|manded, which they con&s;idered not only as a burden, but al&s;o as an affront to their nation; for they looked upon them&s;elves as a free people, having received that privi|lege immediately from God him&s;elf; and therefore they con&s;idered this tribute as a daily and &s;tanding in&s;tance of their &s;lavery, which they dete&s;ted above every thing; and it was this that betrayed them into &s;o many rebellions again&s;t the Romans. We may add, that the&s;e publicans were obliged by their office to have frequent dealings and con|ver&s;ation with the Gentiles, which the Jews con&s;idered as an abomination; and though they were them&s;elves Jews, they rigorou&s;ly exacted the taxes of their brethren, and thereby &s;eemed to con&s;pire with the Romans to entail perpetual &s;lavery on their own countrymen.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="029927_0310_0FE33A8D62FF1B40">THE Publicans, by the&s;e practices, became univer&s;ally abhorred by the Jewi&s;h nation, &s;o that it was reckoned unlawful to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the common offices of humanity: nay, they a&s;&s;erted it was no crime to cheat and over-reach a publican, though they broke the &s;olemnity of an oath: they might not eat or drink, conver&s;e or travel with them; they were con&s;idered as common thieves and robbers, and the money received of them was not permitted to be depo&s;ited with others, con&s;idering it as gained by rapine and vio|lence; they were not admitted to give te&s;timony in any court of ju&s;tice; they were looked upon in &s;o infamous a light, that they were not only bani&s;hed from all commu|nication in matters of divine wor&s;hip, but &s;hunned in all affairs of civil &s;ociety and commerce, as the pe&s;ts of their country, as per&s;ons who&s;e conver&s;ation was infectious, and not at all better than the Heathens them&s;elves. And hence they had a common proverb among&s;t them, 'Take not a wife out of that family in which there is a publican; for they are all publicans!' that is, they are all thieves, robbers, and wicked &s;inners. And to this proverbial cu&s;tom our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour alludes, when &s;peaking of a hardened &s;inner, on whom neither private reproofs, nor the public cen&s;ures and admonitions of the church, can prevail, <HI>Let him be to thee as an Heathen man and publican;</HI> or, in other words, an incorrigible &s;inner.</P>
<P>ST. MATTHEW the evangeli&s;t was of this profe&s;&s;ion, and he &s;eems to have been more particularly employed in collecting the cu&s;toms on commodities that came by &s;ea into Galilee, and the tribute which pa&s;&s;engers were to pay who went by water: and for this purpo&s;e the office or cu&s;tom-hou&s;e &s;tood by the &s;ea &s;ide, that the officers might be always at hand: and here it was, as St. Mark intimates, that Matthew &s;at at the receipt of cu&s;|tom, where the tribute-money was collected.</P>
<P>AFTER having cured a per&s;on long afflicted with the pal&s;y, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord retired out of Capernaum, to walk by the &s;ea-&s;ide, where he taught the people that flocked after him. Here he &s;aw Matthew &s;itting in his office, and called him to follow him. The man was rich, had a large and profitable employment, was a wi&s;e and prudent per|&s;on, and doubtle&s;s under&s;tood what it would co&s;t him to comply with the call of JESUS: he was not ignorant that he mu&s;t exchange wealth for poverty, a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e for a pri&s;on, rich and powerful ma&s;ters, for a naked and de&s;pi&s;ed Saviour: but he overlooked all the&s;e con&s;iderations, left all his intere&s;t and relations, to become our Lord's di&s;ciple, and to embrace a more &s;piritual way of commerce and traffic, which might bring glory to God, and peace of con&s;cience to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is not likely that he was before wholly unacquainted with our Saviour's per&s;on or doctrine, e&s;pecially as he re&s;ided at Capernaum, where our Lord &s;o often preached, and wrought his miracles; &s;o that he mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be prepared to receive the im|pre&s;&s;ions which our Saviour's call made upon him, and to &s;hew that he was not di&s;contented at his change, he entertained both his Ma&s;ter and his di&s;ciples at his hou&s;e, calling toge|ther, his friends, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of his own profe&s;&s;ion, hoping no doubt that they might al&s;o be converted by the company and conver&s;ation of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer.</P>
<P>AS the Phari&s;ees had &s;ought all opportunities of rai&s;ing objections again&s;t the doctrine of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, &s;o they took this opportunity of &s;ugge&s;ting to his di&s;ciples, that it was highly unbecoming &s;o pure and holy a per&s;on, as their Ma&s;ter pretended him&s;elf to be, to conver&s;e &s;o familiarly with the wor&s;t of men, with publicans and &s;inners, per&s;ons in|famous to a proverb; but he pre&s;ently replied to them, that the&s;e were the &s;ick, and there|fore needed the phy&s;ician: that his company was of mo&s;t con&s;equence, where the &s;ouls of men mo&s;t required it: that God him&s;elf preferred works of mercy and charity, e&s;pecially in doing good to the &s;ouls of men, infinitely above all ritual ob&s;ervances, and that the
<PB N="291" REF="029927_0311_0FE33A8FD6AF0D78">
principal de&s;ign of his coming into the world, was not to call the righteous, or tho&s;e who like them&s;elves vainly pretended to be &s;o, but &s;inners, mode&s;t, humble, &s;elf-con|vinced &s;inners, to repentance, and to reduce them to a better &s;tate and cour&s;e of life than they had hitherto pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>ST. MATTHEW after his election to the apo&s;tle&s;hip, continued with the re&s;t till the a&s;cen&s;ion of his great and beloved Ma&s;ter, after which, for the fir&s;t eight years at lea&s;t he preached in different parts of Judea, but afterwards he left the country of Pale&s;tine to convert the Gentile world before his departure, he was entreated by the Jewi&s;h converts to write the hi&s;tory of the life and actions of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, and leave it among&s;t them as a &s;tanding monument of what he had &s;o often delivered to them in his &s;ermons. This he readily complied with, as we &s;hall more particularly mention, in giving an ac|count of the go&s;pel penned by him.</P>
<P>LEAVING Judea, he travelled into &s;everal parts, e&s;pecially Ethiopia; but the parti|cular places he vi&s;ited are not known with any certainty. Metaphra&s;tus tells us, that he fir&s;t vi&s;ited Parthia, and after planting Chri&s;tianity in tho&s;e parts, he travelled into Ethiopia; where, by his preaching and miracles, he triumphed over &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry, convinced multitudes of the error of their ways, and prevailed on them to obey the precepts of the go&s;pel: ordained them &s;piritual guides and pa&s;tors to confirm them in the faith, and bringing over others to the religion of the &s;on of God, which he had inculcated both by his doctrine and example.</P>
<P>HAVING laboured indefatigably in the vineyard of his Ma&s;ter, he afterwards &s;uffered martyrdom at a city of Ethiopia, called Naddabar; but by what kind of death, is not ab|&s;olutely known, though the general opinion is that he was &s;lain with an halbert.</P>
<P>THIS apo&s;tle was a remarkable in&s;tance of the power of religion, in bringing men to a better temper of mind. If we reflect upon his circum&s;tances while he continued a &s;tranger to the great Redeemer of mankind, we &s;hall find that the love of the world had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his heart. He had acquired a plentiful e&s;tate, was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very rich and profit|able office, &s;upported by the power and favour of the Romans, prompted by covetous inclinations, and the&s;e confirmed by long habits and cu&s;toms: but notwith&s;tanding all this, no &s;ooner did CHRIST call him, than he abandoned, without the lea&s;t &s;cruple or he&s;itation, all his riches; nay, he not only renounced his lucrative office, but ran the greate&s;t hazard of di&s;plea&s;ing the ma&s;ters who employed him, for quitting their &s;ervice, without giving them the lea&s;t notice and leaving his accounts in confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>HAD our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour appeared as a &s;ecular prince clothed with temporal power and authority, it would have been no wonder for St. Matthew to have gone over to his &s;er|vice: but when he appeared under all the circum&s;tances of meanne&s;s and di&s;grace, when he &s;eems to promi&s;e his followers nothing but mi&s;ery and &s;ufferings in this life, and to propo&s;e no other rewards than the invi&s;ible encouragements of another world, his change appears truly wonderful and &s;urpri&s;ing. It was indeed &s;o remarkable, that both Porphyry and Julian two &s;ubtle adver&s;aries of the Chri&s;tian religion, took occa&s;ion from hence to charge him either with fal&s;ehood or folly: with the former, if he did not give a true account of things; and with the latter, if his ca&s;e was fairly repre&s;ented, in &s;o ha&s;tily following the per&s;on who called him: but the&s;e detractors would have done well to have remembered, that the holy JESUS was no common per&s;on; his commands were attended with &s;omething more than common.</P>
<P>ST. JEROM is of opinion, that be&s;ides the divinty which evidently appeared in the miracles of the Lamb of God, there was a divine brightne&s;s and kind of maje&s;ty in his
<PB N="292" REF="029927_0312_0FE33A2E66AC3908">
looks, which was at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;ufficient to draw per&s;ons after him; but however that b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his miraculous powers that reflected a lu&s;tre from every quarter, and the efficacy of his doctrine accompanied with the divine grace made way for the &s;ummons &s;ent to our apo&s;tle, and enabled him to conquer all oppo&s;itions, and all the difficulties that oppo&s;ed his obeying the commands of his Saviour, when he received the powerful call.</P>
<P>A &s;till further evidence of this contempt of the world appeared in his exemplary tem|perance and ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s from all delights and plea&s;ures; nay, even from the ordinary conveniency and accommodations of it: he was &s;o far from indulging his appetite with delicate rarities, that he refu&s;ed to gratify it with lawful and ordinary provi&s;ions; his u&s;ual diet being only herbs, roots, &s;eeds, and berries: but what appeared mo&s;t remarkable in him, and which, though the lea&s;t virtue in it&s;elf, is the greate&s;t in the e&s;teem and value of a wi&s;e man, was his humility: he was mean and mode&s;t in his own opinion, always preferring others to him&s;elf: for whereas the other evangeli&s;ts, in de&s;cribing the apo&s;tles by pairs, con&s;tantly place him before St. Thomas, he mode&s;tly places him before him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE re&s;t of the evangeli&s;ts are careful to mention the honour of his apo&s;tle&s;hip, but &s;peak of his former &s;ordid, di&s;hone&s;t, and di&s;graceful cour&s;e of life, only under the name of Levi; while he him&s;elf &s;ets it down, with all its circum&s;tances, under his own proper and common name; a conduct which at once commends the prudence and candour of the apo&s;tle, and &s;ugge&s;ts to us this u&s;eful reflection. That the greate&s;t &s;inners are not excluded from divine grace; nor can any, if penitent, have ju&s;t rea&s;on to de&s;pair, when publicans and &s;inners find mercy at the throne of grace. The conduct of the other evan|geli&s;ts with regard to St. Matthew, &s;hould al&s;o teach us to u&s;e a penitent brother with the greate&s;t mode&s;ty and tenderne&s;s; it being contrary to the rules of civility, as well as the laws of religion, to upbraid and reproach a per&s;on, after his repentance, with the errors of his former life and practices.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall conclude the life of this apo&s;tle with a remark concerning his go&s;pel, which was written at the entreaty of the Jewi&s;h converts, while he abode in Pale&s;tine, but at what particular time, is uncertain; &s;ome will have it to be written eight, &s;ome fifteen, and &s;ome thirty years after our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion: it was originally written in Hebrew, but &s;oon after tran&s;lated into Greek by one of the di&s;ciples, probably by St. James the Le&s;s: but whoever the tran&s;lator was, it of no con&s;equence, becau&s;e the ver&s;ion was well known to the apo&s;tles, and approved by them; and accordingly the church has from the earlie&s;t ages received the Greek copy as authentic, and placed it in the &s;acred canon of Scripture.</P>
<P>THE Greek tran&s;lation having been entertained, the Hebrew copy was afterwards chiefly owned and u&s;ed by the Nazaraei, a middle &s;ect between Jews and Chri&s;tians; with the former, they adhered to the rites and ceremonies of the Mo&s;aic law; and with the latter, they believed in CHRIST, and embraced his religion; and hence this go&s;pel has been &s;tyled, 'The go&s;pel according to the Hebrews, and the go&s;pel of the Nazarenes.' But after a time, it was interpolated by the&s;e Chri&s;tians, who in&s;erted &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of the evangelical hi&s;tory; which they had heard from the apo&s;tles, or from tho&s;e who had familiarly conver&s;ed with them; and to the&s;e additions the ancient fathers frequently refer in their writings. The Ebonites, on the contrary, &s;truck out many pa&s;&s;ages becau&s;e they were not favourable to their tenets. A Hebrew copy of St. Matthew's go&s;pel (but whe|ther exactly the &s;ame as that written by the apo&s;tle, is uncertain) was found among&s;t the other books in the trea&s;ury of the Jews at Tiberias, by one Jo&s;eph, a Jew, who, after his conver&s;ion, was a man of great honour and e&s;teem in the reign of Con&s;tantine. St. Jerom a&s;&s;ures us that another was kept in the library at Cae&s;area in his time, and another by the Nazarenes at Berea, from whom he procured the liberty to tran&s;cribe it, and which he afterwards
<PB N="293" REF="029927_0313_0FE33A81693C9C30">
tran&s;lated both into Greek and Latin, with this remarkable ob&s;ervation, that in quoting the text of the Old Te&s;tament, the evangeli&s;t immediately follows the Hebrew, without taking notice of the Septuagint tran&s;lation. A copy of this go&s;pel was al&s;o dug up in the year 485, on opening the grave of St. Barnabas, in Cyprus, tran&s;cribed with his own hand; but the&s;e copies have long &s;ince peri&s;hed: and with regard to tho&s;e publi&s;hed &s;ince by Tile and Mun&s;ter, the barbarous and corrupt &s;tile &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate that they were not originals, but the tran&s;lation of a more ignorant and corrupt age, and there|fore de&s;ervedly rejected by the more judicious and enlightened part of mankind.</P>

MARK was generally con&s;idered by the ancients, as one of the &s;eventy di&s;ciples; and Epiphanius expre&s;sly tells us, that 'he was one of tho&s;e who, taking exception at our Lord's di&s;cour&s;e of eating his fle&s;h and drinking his blood, went back and walked no more with him.' But there appears no manner of foundation for the&s;e opinions, nor for that of Nicephorus, who will have him to be the &s;on of St. Peter's &s;i&s;ter: nay, Pepias, bi&s;hop of Hierapolis, who lived near the apo&s;tolic times, po&s;itively affirms, that he was neither a hearer nor follower of our Saviour. It is therefore mo&s;t probable, that he was converted by &s;ome of the apo&s;tles, perhaps by St. Peter, whom he con&s;tantly attended in his travels, &s;upplying the place of an amanuen&s;is and interpreter: for though, the apo&s;tles were divinely in&s;pired, and had, among&s;t other miraculous powers, the gift of tongues conferred upon them, yet the interpretation of tongues was a gift more peculiar to &s;ome than to others; and this probably was St. Mark's talent, in expounding St. Peter's di&s;cour&s;es whether by word or writing, to tho&s;e who were &s;trangers to the language in which they were delivered: but however this be, he accompanied him in his apo&s;tolical progre&s;s, preached the go&s;pel in Italy and at Rome, where, at the reque&s;t of the Chri&s;tians of tho&s;e parts, he compo&s;ed and wrote the go&s;pel, which is called after his name.</P>
<P>WE are told by Eu&s;ebius, that St. Mark was &s;ent into Egypt by St. Peter to preach the go&s;pel, and accordingly planted a church in Alexandria, the metropolis of it; and his &s;ucce&s;s was &s;o very remarkable, that he converted multitudes both of men and women, per&s;uading them not only to embrace the Chri&s;tian religion, but al&s;o a life of more than ordinary &s;trictne&s;s. That there was indeed a &s;ect in Egypt remarkably &s;trict in their di&s;|cipline is evident from Philo, who gives the following account of them.</P>
<P>'THERE is, &s;ays he, a &s;ort of per&s;ons in many parts of the world, e&s;pecially near the Maroeotick lake in Egypt, who have formed them&s;elves into religious &s;ocieties and lead a &s;trict philo&s;ophical and contemplative cour&s;e of life. When they fir&s;t enter on this manner of living, they renounce all &s;ecular intere&s;ts and employments, and leaving their e&s;tates to their relations, retire into gardens, and places devoted to &s;olitude and contem|plation. Their hou&s;es, or colleges, are not contiguous, that, being free from noi&s;e and tumult, they might the better attend to the de&s;igns of a contemplative life; nor yet removed at too great di&s;tance, that they may maintain mutual &s;ociety, and be conveniently capa|ble of helping and a&s;&s;i&s;ting one another.

Their di&s;cour&s;es are commonly my&s;tical and allegorical, &s;eeking hidden &s;en&s;es under plain words; and of &s;uch an allegorical philo&s;o|phy the books of their religion, left them by their ance&s;tors, con&s;i&s;t: the law they com|pare to an animal, the letters of it re&s;embling the body, while the &s;oul of it lies in the&s;e ab&s;tru&s;e and recondite notions, which the external veil and &s;urface of the words conceal from common under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>'WITH regard to their method of living, they take very little care of their bodies, &s;pending their whole time in perfecting their minds by precepts of wi&s;dom and religion; the day they wholly &s;pend in pious and divine meditations, in reading and expounding the law and the prophets, and the holy volumes of the ancient founders of their &s;ect, and in &s;inging P&s;alms to the honour of their Maker; ab&s;olutely temporate and ab&s;temious, neither eating nor drinking till night, the only time they think proper to refre&s;h and regale the body: and &s;ome of them out of an in&s;atiable de&s;ire of growing in know|ledge and virtue, fa&s;t many days together. Their diet is plain and &s;imple, &s;ufficient only to &s;atisfy the calls of nature, a little bread, &s;alt, and water, being their con&s;tant bill of fare. Their clothes are as mean as their food, de&s;igned only as pre&s;ent &s;ecurity again&s;t cold and nakedne&s;s. Nor is this the ca&s;e only of the men, but al&s;o of the pious and de|vout women that live among&s;t them; who religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve every &s;eventh day, and e&s;pecially the preparatory week to the great &s;olemnity, which they keep with all expre&s;&s;ions of &s;incere devotion, and al&s;o with &s;evere ab&s;tinence.'</P>
<P>EUSEBIUS affirms, that the&s;e excellent per&s;ons were Chri&s;tians, converted and brought under &s;uch admirable rules and in&s;titutions by St. Mark at his coming hither, accommo|dating all pa&s;&s;ages to the manner and di&s;cipline of the Chri&s;tians: and is followed by Epiphanius, Jerom, and others. But whoever &s;eriou&s;ly and impartially con&s;iders Philo's account, will plainly find, that he intends it of the Jews, and profe&s;&s;ors of the Mo&s;aic reli|gion, though what particular &s;ect they were, I &s;hall not pretend to determine; perhaps they were E&s;&s;enes: but however that be, it is plain they were not Chri&s;tians; for Philo &s;peaks of them as an in&s;titution of &s;ome &s;tanding; whereas, the Chri&s;tians had but very lately appeared in the world, e&s;pecially in Egypt: be&s;ides, many parts of Philo's account does not in &s;everal parts agree with the &s;tate and manners of the Chri&s;tians at that time; as that they withdrew them&s;elves from public conver&s;ation, and all the affairs of civil life, which the Chri&s;tians never did, but when forced to it by violent per&s;ecutions; for at other times, as Ju&s;tin Martyr, and Tertullian tells us, they mixed them&s;elves promi&s;|cuou&s;ly with the inhabitants of the country, dwelt in towns and cities, ploughed their lands, and followed their re&s;pective trades and callings like other men. Nor can the books which Philo tells us they had, be&s;ides tho&s;e of Mo&s;es and the prophets, be under|&s;tood of tho&s;e of the Chri&s;tians; for the writings of the evangeli&s;ts had been very lately publi&s;hed, and con&s;equently could not come under the character of ancient authors. Not to mention that &s;ome of their ceremonies were &s;uch as the Chri&s;tians of tho&s;e days were ab&s;olute &s;trangers to, not being introduced into the church till &s;ome ages after Philo wrote his account: nay, &s;ome of them were never u&s;ed by the primitive Chri&s;tians, e&s;pecially their religious dances, which Philo particularly de&s;cribes, as u&s;ed by them at their fe&s;tival &s;olemnities, e&s;pecially that remarkable one which they ob&s;erved at the end of every &s;even weeks; when their entertainment being ended, they all ro&s;e up, the men in one com|pany,
<PB N="295" REF="029927_0315_0FE3394B2DB917E8">
and the women in another, dancing with various mea&s;ures and motions, each com|pany &s;inging divine hymns and &s;ongs, and having a precentor going before each divi&s;ion, &s;inging alternately; till, in the conclu&s;ion, they joined in one common chorus, in imi|tation of the triumphant &s;ong &s;ung by Mo&s;es and the I&s;raelites, after their great deliverance at the Red Sea, from the ho&s;tile attempts of Pharaoh and his army.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e, and &s;everal other particulars that might be mentioned, it will appear, that the&s;e could not be Chri&s;tians; it is not indeed to be doubted, but that per&s;ons educated under &s;uch excellent rules and methods of life, were more than ordinarily prepared for the reception of Chri&s;tianity, and could not fail of rendering St. Mark's &s;ucce&s;s &s;ur|pri&s;ing in tho&s;e parts, and open a path for men to come in multitudes to embrace the doctrines of the go&s;pel of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>THIS apo&s;tle did not confine him&s;elf to Alexandria, and the oriental parts of Egypt, but removed we&s;tward to Lybia, pa&s;&s;ing through the countries of Marmarcia, Pentapolis, and others adjacent, where, though the people were both barbarous in their manners, and idolatrous in their wor&s;hip, yet by his preaching and miracles, he prevailed on them to embrace the tenets of the go&s;pel; nor did he leave them till he had confirmed them in the faith of his divine Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>HE returned, after his long tour, to Alexandria, where he preached with the greate&s;t freedom, ordered and di&s;po&s;ed of the affairs of the church, and wi&s;ely provided for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by con&s;tituting governors and pa&s;tors of it. But the re&s;tle&s;s enemy of the &s;ouls of men, would not &s;uffer our apo&s;tle to continue in peace and quietne&s;s: for while he was a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly labouring in the vineyard of his Ma&s;ter the idolatrous inhabitants about the time of Ea&s;ter, when they were celebrating the &s;olemnities of Serapis, tumultu|ou&s;ly entered the church, forced St. Mark, then performing divine &s;ervice, from thence, and binding his feet with cords, draged him through the &s;treets, and over the mo&s;t craggy places to the Bucelus, a precipice near the &s;ea, leaving him there in a lone&s;ome pri&s;on for that night; but his great and beloved Ma&s;ter appeared to him in a vi&s;ion, comfort|ing and encouragng his &s;oul, under the ruins of his &s;hattered body. The next morning early, the tragedy began a fre&s;h, dragging him about in the &s;ame cruel and barbarous manner, till he expired: but their malice did not end with his death, they burnt his mangled body, after they had &s;o inhumanly deprived it of life; but the Chri&s;tians, after the helli&s;h tragedy was over, gathered up his bones and a&s;hes, and decently interred them near the place where he u&s;ed to preach. His remains were afterwards, with great pomp, removed from Alexandria to Venice, where they are religiou&s;ly honoured, and he adopted as the titular &s;aint and pattern of that &s;tate and people. He &s;uffered mar|tyrdom on the 25th of April, but the year is not ab&s;olutely known; the mo&s;t probable opinion however is, that it happened about the end of Nero's reign.</P>
<P>AS to his per&s;on, St. Mark was of a middle &s;ize and &s;tature, his no&s;e long, his eye|brows turning back, his eyes graceful and amiable, his head bald, his beard thick and grey, his gait quick, and the con&s;titution of his body &s;trong and healthful.</P>
<P>THE only writing he left behind him, was his go&s;pel, written, as we have before ob|&s;erved, at the entreaty and earne&s;t de&s;ire of the converts at Rome, who not content to have heard St. Peter preach, pre&s;&s;ed St. Mark his di&s;ciple, to commit to writing, an hi&s;|torical account of what he had delivered to them, which he performed with equal faith|fulne&s;s and brevity, and being peru&s;ed and approved by St. Peter, and commanded to be publicly read in their a&s;&s;emblies. It was frequently &s;tyled St. Peter's go&s;pel, not be|cau&s;e he dictated it to St. Mark, but becau&s;e the latter compo&s;ed it from the accounts St. Peter u&s;ually delivered in his di&s;cour&s;es to the people: and this is probably the rea&s;on

<HEAD>ST. LUKE THE EVANGELIST.</HEAD>
<P>ST. LUKE was born at Antioch, the metropolis of Syria, a city celebrated for the plea&s;antne&s;s of its &s;ituation, the fertility of its &s;oil, the riches of its commerce, the wi&s;dom of its &s;enate, and the civility and politene&s;s of its inhabitants, by the pens of &s;ome of the greate&s;t orators of tho&s;e times. It was eminent for &s;chools of learning, which produced the mo&s;t renowned ma&s;ters in the arts and &s;ciences; &s;o that being born as it were, in the lap of the mu&s;es, he could not well fail of acquiring an ingenious and liberal education: but he was not contented with the learning of his own country, he travelled for improvement into &s;everal parts of Greece and Egypt, and became particularly &s;killed in phy&s;ic, which he made his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THEY who would, from this particular, infer the quality of his birth and fortune, &s;eem to forget that the healing art was, in the&s;e early times, generally practi&s;ed by &s;ervants; and hence Grotius is of opinion, that St. Luke was carried to Rome, and lived there a &s;ervant to &s;ome noble family, in quality of phy&s;ician: but after obtaining his freedom, he returned into his own country, and probably continued his profe&s;&s;ion till his death, it being &s;o highly con&s;i&s;tent with, and in many ca&s;es &s;ub&s;ervient to, the care of &s;ouls. He is al&s;o famous for his &s;kill in another art, namely, painting, and an ancient in&s;cription, was found in a vault near the church of St. Maria de Via Lata, at Rome, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the place where St. Paul dwelt, which mentions a picture of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, UNA EX vii. AB LUCA DEPICTIS, <HI>being one of the &s;even painted by St. Luke.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not certainly known when St. Luke became a Chri&s;tian, after having been a Jewi&s;h pro&s;elyte: tho&s;e who under&s;tand him in the beginning of his go&s;pel, to &s;ay that he had the facts from the reports of others, who were eye witne&s;&s;es, &s;uppo&s;e him to have been converted by St. Paul, and that he learned the hi&s;tory of his go&s;pel from the conver&s;ation of that apo&s;tle, and wrote it under his direction; and that when St. Paul, in one of his epi&s;tles, &s;ays, <HI>according to my go&s;pel,</HI> he means this of St. Luke, which he &s;tyle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>his,</HI> from the great &s;hare he had in its compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>THEY, on the other hand, who hold that he wrote his go&s;pel from his own per&s;onal knowledge, ob&s;erve, that he could not receive it from St. Paul, as an eye-witne&s;s of the matter contained in it, becau&s;e all tho&s;e matters were tran&s;acted before his conver&s;ion; and that he never &s;aw our Lord, before he appeared to him in his journey to Dama&s;cus, which was &s;ome time after he a&s;cended into heaven. Con&s;equently, when St. Paul &s;ays, <HI>according to my go&s;pel,</HI> he means no more than the go&s;pel in general which he preached; the whole preaching of the apo&s;tles, &s;tyled the go&s;pel, all having an uniform tendency to inculcate and e&s;tabli&s;h the faith and practice of the Chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P>BUT they further ob&s;erve, that it is not probable that St. Luke was converted by St. Paul, becau&s;e the latter would in that ca&s;e have &s;tyled him his &s;on, it being the con&s;tant, practice of the apo&s;tles to call all eminent converts by that appellation; but he mentions
<PB N="297" REF="029927_0317_0FE3394E3B936B48">
him by the name of <HI>Luke, the beloved phy&s;ician.</HI> They therefore &s;uppo&s;e, that he &s;tudied the law in one of the &s;chools of Jeru&s;alem, where he was converted by our Lord, and was one of the &s;eventy di&s;ciples mentioned in Scripture.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this be, St. Luke became the in&s;eparable companion of St. Paul in all his travels, and his con&s;tant fellow-labourer in the work of the mini&s;try: he followed him in all his dangers, was with him at his &s;everal arraignments at Jeru&s;alem, accompanied him in his tedious and dangerous voyage to Rome, where he &s;till attended on him, to admini&s;ter to him in his nece&s;&s;ities, and &s;upply tho&s;e mini&s;terial offices, which the apo&s;tle's confinement would not &s;uffer him to undertake; and e&s;pecially in carrying me&s;&s;ages to other churches, where he had planted the Chri&s;tian religion. This infinitely endeared him to St. Paul, who &s;eemed delighted with owning him for his fellow-labourer and in calling him the <HI>beloved phy&s;ician,</HI> and the <HI>brother who&s;e prai&s;e is in the go&s;pel,</HI> 2 Cor. viii.13.</P>
<P>IT is very probable, he did not leave St. Paul till he had fini&s;hed his cour&s;e, and received the crown of martyrdom; though &s;ome tells us, that he left St. Paul at Rome, and returned back into the Ea&s;t, travelling into Egypt and &s;everal parts of Libya, where he preached the go&s;pel, wrought miracles, converted multitudes, and con&s;tituted guides and mini&s;ters of religion; nay, that he him&s;elf undertook the epi&s;copal charge of the city of Thebais. Epiphanius tells us, that he fir&s;t preached in Dalmatia and Galatia, then in Italy and Macedonia, where he &s;pared no pains, and declined no dangers, that he might faithfully di&s;charge the tru&s;t committed to him by his great Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE time or manner of his death are not very well agreed upon by the ancients: &s;ome affirming him to die in Egypt, others in Greece, the Roman martyrology in Bythinia, and Dorothaeus at Ephe&s;us; &s;ome will have that he died a natural, and others a violent death. Indeed, neither Eu&s;ebius nor St. Jerom take any notice of it, but Gregory Nazianzen, Paulinus bi&s;hop of Nola, and &s;everal others, expre&s;sly a&s;&s;ert, that he &s;uffered martyrdom; and Nicephorus gives us this particular account of it: "That coming into Greece, he &s;ucce&s;sfully preached the go&s;pel, and bapti&s;ed many converts into the Chri&s;tian faith, till, at la&s;t, a party of infidels oppo&s;ed his doctrines: but being unable to &s;ilence him by r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;on and argument, they had recour&s;e to cruelty, dragged him from the place where he was teaching the go&s;pel, and hung him on an olive tree, in the eightieth, or according to St. Jerom, in the eighty-fourth year of his age." Kir&s;tenius thinks, he &s;uffered martyrdom at Rome &s;oon after St. Paul's fir&s;t impri&s;onment, becau&s;e he did not continue his acts of the apo&s;tles any further, which it is natural to think he would have done, had he lived any con&s;iderable time after St. Paul's departure. His body was afterwards, by the command of Con&s;tantine, or his &s;on Con&s;tantius, removed with great &s;olemnity to Con&s;tantinople, and buried in the great church, erected to the memory of the apo&s;tles, in that city.</P>
<P>HIS go&s;pel, and the acts of the apo&s;tles, were written by him for the u&s;e of the church; both which he dedicated to Theophilus, which many of the ancients &s;uppo&s;ed to be a feigned name, denoting a lover of God, a title common to all &s;incere Chri&s;tians: but others think it was a real per&s;on, becau&s;e the title of "mo&s;t excellent," is attributed to him, the u&s;ual title and form of addre&s;s in tho&s;e times to princes and great men. Pro|bably he was &s;ome magi&s;trate, whom St. Luke had converted and baptized, and to whom he dedicated the&s;e books, not only as a te&s;timony of honourable re&s;pect, but al&s;o as a means of giving him further certainty and a&s;&s;urance of tho&s;e things wherein he had in&s;tructed him, and which it was requi&s;ite he &s;hould be informed of.</P>
<P>THE principal tran&s;actions of our Lord's life are contained in his go&s;pel; and the par|ticulars omitted by him, are, in general, of le&s;s importance than tho&s;e the other evangeli&s;ts forbear to mention.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="029927_0318_0FE33959824D0CE0">THE acts of the apo&s;tles written by St Luke, were no doubt penned at Rome, about the time of St Paul's impri&s;onment there, with which he concludes his hi&s;tory.

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF ST. JOHN, The APOSTLE and EVANGELIST; commonly called the DIVINE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS beloved di&s;ciple of our Lord was a native of Galilee, the &s;on of Zebedee and Salome, one of tho&s;e devout women that con&s;tantly attended on our Lord in his mini&s;try, and brother of James the Great. Before his becoming a di&s;ciple of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, he was, in all brobability, a follower of John the Bapti&s;t, and is thought to be that other di&s;ciple, who, in the fir&s;t chapter of his go&s;pel, is &s;aid to have been pre&s;ent with Andrew when John declared JESUS, to be the <HI>Lamb of God,</HI> and thereupon to have followed him to the place of his re&s;idence.</P>
<P>THOUGH St. John was by much the younge&s;t of the apo&s;tles, he was neverthele&s;s ad|mitted into as great a &s;hare of his Ma&s;ter's confidence as any of them. He was one of tho&s;e to whom he communicated the mo&s;t private tran&s;actions of his life: one of tho&s;e whom he took with him when he rai&s;ed the daughter of Jairus from the dead; one of tho&s;e to whom he exhibited a &s;pecimen of his divinity, in his transfiguration on the mount; one of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent at his conference with Mo&s;es and Elias, and heard that voice which declared him <HI>the beloved Son of God;</HI> and one of tho&s;e who were com|panions in his &s;olitude, mo&s;t retired devotions, and bitter agonies in the garden. Thus of the three who were made the witne&s;&s;es of their Ma&s;ter's actions, which it was conve|nient to conceal, St. John con&s;tantly enjoyed the privilege of being one: nay, even of the&s;e three he &s;eems to have had, in &s;ome re&s;pects, the preference; witne&s;s his lying on his ma&s;ter's bo&s;om at the pa&s;chal &s;upper: and even when Peter was de&s;irous of knowing who was the per&s;on that &s;hould betray their Ma&s;ter, and dur&s;t not him&s;elf a&s;k the que&s;tion, he made u&s;e of St. John, to propo&s;e it to their Lord, as the per&s;on mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed in obtaining an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>OUR apo&s;tle endeavoured, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to an&s;wer the&s;e in&s;tances of particular favour, by returns of particular kindne&s;s and con&s;tancy; for though he had at fir&s;t de|&s;erted his Ma&s;ter on his apprehen&s;ion, yet he &s;oon recovered him&s;elf, and came to &s;eek his &s;aviour, confidently entered the high-prie&s;t's hall, followed our Lord through the &s;everal particulars of his trial, and at la&s;t waited on him at his execution, owning him, as well as being owned by him, in the mid&s;t of armed &s;oldiers, and in the thicke&s;t crowds of his mo&s;t inveterate enemies. Here it was that our great Redeemer committed to his care his &s;orrowful and di&s;con&s;olate mother, with his dying breath. And certainly

the holy JESUS could not have given a more honourable te&s;timony of his particular re|&s;pect and kindne&s;s to St. John, than by leaving his own mother to his tru&s;t and care, and &s;ub&s;tituting him to &s;upply that duty he him&s;elf paid her, while he re&s;ided in this vale of &s;orrow among&s;t men.</P>
<P>ST. JOHN no &s;ooner heard of our Lord's being ri&s;en from the chambers of the du&s;t, than he, in company with Peter, ha&s;tened to the &s;epulchre. There &s;eems indeed to have been a peculiar intimacy between the&s;e two di&s;ciples; it was Peter that St. John introduced into the palace of the high-prie&s;t; it was Peter to whom he gave notice of CHRIST's appearing when he came to them at the &s;ea of Tiberias, in the habit of a &s;tranger; and it was for St. John that Peter was &s;o &s;olicitou&s;ly inqui&s;itive to know what was determined concerning him when our Saviour expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;omewhat ambigu|ou&s;ly re&s;pecting that di&s;ciple.</P>
<P>AFTER the a&s;cen&s;ion of the Saviour of the world, when the apo&s;tles made a divi&s;ion of the provinces among&s;t them&s;elves, that of A&s;ia fell to the &s;hare of St. John, though he did not immediately enter upon his charge, but continued at Jeru&s;alem till the death of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, which happened about fifteen years after our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion: being relea&s;ed from the tru&s;t committed to his care by his dying Ma&s;ter, he retired into A&s;ia, and indu&s;triou&s;ly applied him&s;elf to the propagating of Chri&s;tianity, preaching where the go&s;pel had not yet been known, and confirming it where it was already planted. Many churches of note and eminence were of his founding, particularly tho&s;e of Smyrna, Perga|mus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodocea, and others; but his chief place of re&s;idence was at Ephe&s;us, where St. Paul had many years before founded a church, and con&s;tituted Timothy bi&s;hop of it. Nor can we &s;uppo&s;e that he confined his mini&s;try entirely to A&s;ia Minor; it is highly rea&s;onable to think that he preached in other parts of the Ea&s;t, pro|bably to the Parthians, his fir&s;t epi&s;tle being anciently directed to them; and the Je&s;uits a&s;&s;ure us that the inhabitants of the kingdom of Ba&s;&s;orain Indian affirm, that, according to a tradition handed down from their ance&s;tors, St. John planted the Chri&s;tian faith in their country, where the Chri&s;tians are called by his name.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;pent &s;everal years at Ephe&s;us, he was accu&s;ed to Domitian, who had begun a per&s;ecution again&s;t the Chri&s;tians as an eminent a&s;&s;erter of Athei&s;m and impiety, and a public &s;ubverter of the religion of the empire; &s;o that by his command, the procon&s;ul &s;ent him bound to Rome, where he met with the treatment that might have been expected from &s;o barbarous a prince, being thrown into a chaldron of boiling oil: but the Al|mighty, who re&s;erved him for further &s;ervices in the vineyard of his Son, re&s;trained the heat, as he did in the fiery furnace of old, and delivered him from this &s;eeming una|voidable de&s;truction. And &s;urely one would have thought that &s;o miraculous a deliverance would have been &s;ufficient to have per&s;uaded any rational man that the religion he taught was from God, and that he was protected from danger by the hand of Omnipotence; but miracles them&s;elves were not &s;ufficient to convince this cruel emperor, or abate his fury: he ordered St. John to be tran&s;ported to a di&s;con&s;olate i&s;land in the Archipelago, called Patmos, where he continued &s;everal years in&s;tructing the poor inhabitants in the knowledge of the Chri&s;tian faith; and here, about the end of Domitian's reign, he wrote his book of Revelation, exhibiting, by vi&s;ions and prophetical repre&s;entations, the &s;tate and condition of Chri&s;tianity in the future periods and ages of the church, till the final con&s;umation of all things.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of Domitian, and on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Nerva, who repealed all the odious acts of his predece&s;&s;or, and by public edicts recalled tho&s;e whom the fury of Domi|tian had bani&s;hed, St. John returned to A&s;ia and fixed his &s;eat again at Ephe&s;us; and rather, becau&s;e the people of that city had lately martyred Timothy their bi&s;hop. Here,

with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;even other bi&s;hops, he took upon him&s;elf the government of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> large dioce&s;e of A&s;ia Minor, erected oratories, and di&s;po&s;ed of the clergy in the be&s;t man|ner that the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e times would permit, &s;pending his time in an ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">|gable execution of his charge, travelling from Ea&s;t to We&s;t to in&s;truct the world in the principles of the holy religion he was &s;ent to propagate.

<P>THIS great evangeli&s;t and apo&s;tle &s;eems always to have led a &s;ingle life; though &s;ome of the ancients tell us he was a married man. With regard to his natural temper, he &s;eems to have been of an eager and re&s;olute di&s;po&s;ition, ea&s;ily inflamed, but which age had reduced to a calmer temper. He was poli&s;hed by no &s;tudy or arts of learning; but, what was wanting from human art, was abundantly &s;upplied by the excellent con&s;titution of his mind, and that fulne&s;s of divine grace with which he was adorned: his humility was admirable, &s;tudiou&s;ly concealing his own honour; for in his epi&s;tles, he never &s;tyles him&s;elf either apo&s;tle or evangeli&s;t; the title of pre&s;byter or elder, is all he a&s;&s;umes, and probably in regard to his age as much as his office, in his go&s;pel, when he &s;peaks of <HI>the di&s;ciple whom Je&s;us loved,</HI> he con&s;tantly conceals his own name, leaving the reader to di&s;cover whom he meant: love and charity he practi&s;ed him&s;elf, and affectionately pre&s;&s;ed them upon others; the great love of his Saviour towards him, &s;eems to have in&s;pired his &s;oul with a larger and more generous charity than the re&s;t. This is the great vein that runs through all his writings, e&s;pecially his epi&s;tles, where he urges it as the great and peculiar law of Chri&s;tianity, and without which all other pretences to the religion of the holy JESUS are vain and frivolous, u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant: and this was his con&s;tant practice to the very hour of his di&s;&s;olution; for when age and the decays of nature had rendered him &s;o weak that he was unable to preach to the people any longer, he was con&s;tantly led, at every public meeting, to the church of Ephe&s;us, and always repeated to them the &s;ame precept, <HI>Little children, love one another:</HI> and when his hearers wearied with the con&s;tant repetition of the &s;ame thing, a&s;ked him why he never varied his di&s;|cour&s;e, he an&s;wered, "Becau&s;e to love one another was the command of our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour, and if they did nothing more, this alone was &s;ufficient to denote who&s;e they were, and whom they &s;erved."</P>
<P>THE large&s;t mea&s;ures of his charity were, however, di&s;played in the remarkable care he took to promote the &s;alvation of the &s;ouls of men; travelling from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, in propagating the principles of that religion he was &s;ent to teach, patiently enduring every torment, &s;urmounting every difficulty, and removing every ob&s;tacle, to &s;ave the &s;ouls of the human race, free their minds from error and idolatry, and turn them from the paths of vice and debauchery. Among&s;t many other in&s;tances of this kind, Eu&s;ebius relates the following.</P>
<P>"ST. JOHN, during one of his vi&s;itations of the church at Ephe&s;us, was greatly plea&s;ed with the appearance and behaviour of a young man, whom he called to him, and, with a &s;pe|cial charge, recommended to the bi&s;hop, who undertook the tru&s;t, and promi&s;ed to di&s;charge it with the greate&s;t fidelity: accordingly, the bi&s;hop took him home with him to his hou&s;e carefully in&s;tructed him in the principles of the Chri&s;tian religion, and at la&s;t bapti&s;ed and confirmed him. After he had proceeded thus far, he thought he might a little relax the reins of di&s;cipline; but the youth made a bad u&s;e of his liberty, and being debauched by evil company, became the captain of a gang of robbers, and committed the mo&s;t horrid outrages in the adjacent countries. St. John, being informed of this at his return, &s;harply reproved the bi&s;hop, and determined to find the young man out; never con&s;ider|ing
<PB N="301" REF="029927_0322_0FE33966A6563198">
the dangers that would inevitably attend him, by venturing him&s;elf among&s;t per&s;ons of de&s;perate fortunes: accordingly, he repaired to the mountains where they u&s;ually abode, and being taken by one of the robbers placed as a watch, he de&s;ired to be carried to their captain, who, on &s;eeing St. John coming towards him, immediately fled. The apo&s;tle forgetting his age, ha&s;tened after him; but being unable to overtake him, he pa&s;&s;ionately cried out, 'Child, why do&s;t thou run from thy father, an old and defencele&s;s man? Spare me the pains of following thee, and let not terrors and de&s;pair &s;eize upon thee. Thy &s;alvation is not irrecoverable. Stay, and be convinced that CHRIST him&s;elf hath &s;ent me.' At the&s;e words, the young man &s;topped, fixed his eyes upon the earth, trembled in every part, and bur&s;t into a flood of tears. And when the aged apo&s;tle ap|proached he embraced him, and implored forgivene&s;s with &s;uch weeping and lamenta|tions, that he &s;eemed to be re-baptized, and to wa&s;h away his &s;ins with his own tears. The apo&s;tle received him with the greate&s;t kindne&s;s, a&s;&s;ured him that he had obtained pardon for his &s;ins at the hands of his great Redeemer, and returned him a true penitent and convert to the church of which he was a member.</P>
<P>OUR apo&s;tle's care for the &s;ouls of men, is further evidenced by the writings he left to po&s;terity, The fir&s;t of which in time, though placed la&s;t in the &s;acred canon, is his Apocalyp&s;e, or book of Revelation, which he wrote during his bani&s;hment at Patmos. After the preface and admonition given to the bi&s;hops of the &s;even churches in A&s;ia, it contains a prophetic view of the per&s;ecutions the faithful were to &s;uffer from the Jews, Heretics, and tyrannical princes, together with the peaceable and flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the church, till di&s;turbed by other enemies; and the happine&s;s of the church triumphant in heaven. And hence St. John is, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, a prophet, and has thereby one material addition to his titles, being not only an apo&s;tle and evangeli&s;t, but al&s;o a prophet: an honour peculiar to him&s;elf. St. Peter was an apo&s;tle, but no evangeli&s;t: St. Mark and St. Luke were evangeli&s;ts, but no apo&s;tles: St. Matthew, was an apo&s;tle and evangeli&s;t, but no prophet: but St. John was an apo&s;tle, an evangeli&s;t, and a prophet likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>HIS three epi&s;tles take place, in order of time, next to the Apocalyp&s;e; the fir&s;t of which is catholic, being calculated for all times and places, and containing the mo&s;t ex|cellent rules for the conduct of a Chri&s;tian life, pre&s;&s;ing to holine&s;s and purene&s;s of man|ners, and not to be &s;atisfied with a naked and empty profe&s;&s;ion of religion; not to be led away with the crafty in&s;inuations of &s;educers; and cautioning men again&s;t the poi&s;onous principles and practices of the Gno&s;tics. The apo&s;tle here, according to his u&s;ual mo|de&s;ty, conceals his name, it being of more con&s;equence to a wi&s;e man what is &s;aid, than he who &s;ays it. It appears from St. Augu&s;tine, that this epi&s;tle was anciently in&s;cribed to the Parthians, becau&s;e, in all probability, St. John preached the go&s;pel in Parthia. The other two epi&s;tles are but &s;hort, and directed to particular per&s;ons; the one a lady of great quality, the other to the charitable and ho&s;pitable Gaius, the kinde&s;t friend, and the mo&s;t courteous entertainer of all indigent Chri&s;tians, in tho&s;e primitive times.</P>
<P>WE are told by Eu&s;ebius and St. Jerom, that St. John, having peru&s;ed the other three go&s;pels, approved and confirmed them by his authority; but ob&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, that the&s;e evangeli&s;ts had omitted &s;everal of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's tran&s;actions, particu|larly tho&s;e which were performed before the Bapti&s;t's impri&s;onment, he wrote his go&s;pel to &s;upply what was wanting in them; and becau&s;e &s;everal Heretics were at that time &s;prung up in the church, who denied the divinity of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, he took care to guard again&s;t the&s;e here&s;ies, by proving that our great Redeemer was God from ever|la&s;ting. He largely records our Saviour's di&s;cour&s;es, but takes little notice of his mi|racles, probably becau&s;e the other evangeli&s;ts had &s;o fully and particularly written con|cerning them.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="029927_0323_0FE33968F5039C08">PREVIOUS to his undertaking the ta&s;k of writing his go&s;pel, he cau&s;ed a general fa&s;t to be kept by all the A&s;ian churches, to implore the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven on &s;o great and momentous an undertaking. When this was done, he &s;et about the work, and com|pleated it in &s;o excellent and &s;ublime a manner, that the ancients generally compared him to an eagle's &s;oaring aloft among&s;t the clouds, whither the weak eye of man was not able to follow him. "Among all the evangelical writers," &s;ays St. Ba&s;il, "none are like St. John, the &s;on of thunder, for the &s;ublimity of his &s;peech, and the height of his di&s;cour&s;es, which are beyond any man's capacity fully to reach and comprehend." "St. John, as a true &s;on of thunder," &s;ays Epiphanius, by a loftine&s;s of &s;peech peculiar to him&s;elf, "acquaints us, as it were out of the clouds and dark rece&s;&s;es of wi&s;dom, with the divine doctrine of the Son of God, the glorious Saviour of mankind."</P>
<P>THUS have we given the character of the writings of this great apo&s;tle and evangeli&s;t, who as we have hinted before, was honoured with the endearing title of being the be|loved di&s;ciple of the Son of God; and was a writer &s;o &s;ublime as to de&s;erve, by way of eminence, the character of <HI>St. John the Divine.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF ST. PAUL, The APOSTLE to the GENTILES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS eminent and laborious apo&s;tle was a native of Tar&s;us, and a de&s;cendant from the ancient &s;tock of Abraham. He was born about two years before the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, and belonged to the tribe of Benjamin, the younge&s;t &s;on of Jacob, who thus pro|phecied of him. <HI>Benjamin &s;hall raven as a wolf; in the morning he &s;hall devour the prey, and at night he &s;hall divide the &s;poil;</HI> a prophetical character which Tertullian and others will have to be accompli&s;hed in this apo&s;tle: for, in his youth, or the morning of his days, he pro&s;ecuted the churches, de&s;troying the flock of the Almighty; devouring the prey: in his declining age, or evening of his days, he became a phy&s;ician of the nations, feeding and di&s;tributing with the greate&s;t care and a&s;&s;iduity, the &s;heep of CHRIST, the great Shepherd of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>THE place of this apo&s;tle's nativity, was Tar&s;us, the metropolis of Cilica, &s;ituated about three hundred miles di&s;tant from Jeru&s;alem; it was exceedingly rich and populous, and a Roman municipium, or free corporation, inve&s;ted with the privileges of Rome by the two fir&s;t emperors, as a reward for the citizens' firm adherence to the Cae&s;ars, in the rebellion of Cra&s;&s;us. St. Paul was therefore born a Roman citizen, and he often pleads this privilege on his trials.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of Tar&s;us u&s;ually &s;ent their children into other cities for learning and improvement, e&s;pecially to Jeru&s;alem, where they were &s;o numerous, that they had a &s;ynagogue of their own, called the &s;ynagogue of the Cilic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s. To this capital our apo&s;tle was al&s;o &s;ent, and brought up at the feet of that eminent rabbi Gamalia, in the mo&s;t exact knowledge of the law of Mo&s;es: nor did he fail to profit by the in&s;tructions of that great ma&s;ter; for he &s;o diligently conformed him&s;elf to his precepts, that, with|out boa&s;ting, he a&s;&s;erts of him&s;elf, that touching the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, he was blamele&s;s, and defied even his enemies to alledge any thing to the contrary, even in his youth. He joined him&s;elf to the &s;ect of the Phari&s;ees, the mo&s;t &s;trict order of the Jewi&s;h religion; but, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ame time, the proude&s;t, and the greate&s;t enemies to CHRIST and his holy religion, as evidently appears by the character given of them by the evangeli&s;ts, and our Lord's de&s;cription of that &s;elf-righteous &s;ect.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="029927_0324_0FE3396A796B5B28">RESPECTING his double capacity, of Jewi&s;h extraction and Roman freedom, he had two names <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> the former Hebrew, and the latter Latin. It was common for the de&s;cendants of Benjamin to give the name of Saul to their children ever &s;ince the time of the fir&s;t king of I&s;rael, who was cho&s;en out of that tribe; and Paul was a name as common among&s;t the Romans. We mu&s;t al&s;o con&s;ider his trade of tent-ma|king as part of his education, it being the con&s;tant practice of the Jews, to bring up their children to &s;ome hone&s;t calling, that, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, they might provide for them&s;elves by the labour of their own hands, without becoming burthen&s;ome to the public.</P>
<P>HAVING obtained a thorough knowledge of the &s;ciences cultivated by the Jews, and being naturally of a very hot and fiery temper, Saul became a great champion for the law of Mo&s;es, and the tradition of the elders, which he con&s;idered as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eal for God. This rendered him impatient of all oppo&s;ition to the doctrine and tenets he had imbibed, and a vehement bla&s;phemer and per&s;ecutor of Chri&s;tians, who were commonly reputed the enemies and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;troyers of the Jewi&s;h economy. We mu&s;t not however con&s;ider our apo&s;tle as guilty of the pride and hypocri&s;y of the Phari&s;ees; for he declares, that he had ever been careful to act in conformity to the dictates of his con&s;cience, by which he thought him&s;elf bound to do many things contrary to the name of JESUS of Nazareth. It was therefore the prejudice of his education, and the natural warmth of his temper, that excited him to tho&s;e violent per&s;ecutions of the Chri&s;tians, for which he became &s;o famous, in the infancy of the church.</P>
<P>WE find that the fir&s;t action he engaged in, was the di&s;putation he and his countrymen had with the martyr Stephen, concerning the Me&s;&s;iah. The Chri&s;tian was too hard for them in the di&s;pute; but they were too powerful for him in their civil intere&s;ts; for being enraged at his convincing arguments, they carried him before the high-prie&s;t, who, by fal&s;e accu&s;ations condemned him to death. How far Saul was concerned in this cruel action, is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay; all we know is, that he kept the raiment of them that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ew him, and, con&s;equently, was acce&s;&s;ary to his death.</P>
<P>THE enemies of the church having thus rai&s;ed a &s;torm of per&s;ecution again&s;t it, it increa&s;ed prodigiou&s;ly, and the poor Chri&s;tians of Jeru&s;alem were mi&s;erably harra&s;&s;ed and di&s;per&s;ed. In this per&s;ecution, our apo&s;tle was principal agent, &s;earching all the ad|jacent parts for the afflicted &s;aints, beating &s;ome in the &s;ynagogue, compelling &s;ome to bla&s;pheme, confining &s;ome in pri&s;on, and procuring others to be put to death for their profe&s;&s;ion: nor could Jeru&s;alem and the adjacent parts confine his fiery zeal; he applied to the Sanhedrim, and procured a commi&s;&s;ion from that court, to extend his per&s;ecution to Dama&s;cus. How eternally in&s;atiable is the fury of a mi&s;guided zeal! how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and unwearied in its de&s;igns of cruelty? It had already &s;ufficiently harra&s;&s;ed the poor Chri&s;tians at Jeru&s;alem, but not content with that, it per&s;ecuted them to &s;trange cities; even to Dama&s;cus it&s;elf, whither many of them had fled for &s;helter, re&s;olving to being them back to Jeru&s;alem, in order to their puni&s;hment and execution there.</P>
<P>WE think it nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve here, that the Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim had not only the power of &s;eizing and &s;courging offenders again&s;t their law within the bounds of their own country, but, by the connivance and favour of the Romans, might &s;end into other countries, where there were any &s;ynagogues that acknowledged a dependence in religi|ous affairs upon the council of Jeru&s;alem, to apprehend them: and accordingly, Saul was &s;ent to Dama&s;cus, to apprehend what Chri&s;tians he could find in that city, and bring them bound to Jeru&s;alem, to be tried and puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>IT was however Saul's peculiar happine&s;s, that the Almighty de&s;igned to employ him in a work of a very different nature, and, accordingly &s;topped him in his journey: for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he

was travelling between Jeru&s;alem and Dama&s;cus, to execute the commi&s;&s;ion of the Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim, a refulgent light, far exceeding the brightne&s;s of the &s;un, darted upon him; at which both he and his companions were terribly amazed and confounded, falling toge|ther with their hor&s;es, pro&s;trate on the ground. Amid&s;t this confu&s;ion, a voice was heard in the Hebrew language, &s;aying <HI>Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?</HI> To which Saul replied, <HI>Who art thou, Lord?</HI> And was immediately an&s;wered, <HI>I am Je&s;us,</HI> of Nazareth, <HI>whom thou per&s;ecute&s;t: it is hard for thee to kick again&s;t the pricks.</HI> As if the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS had &s;aid, "All thy attempts to extirpate the faith in me, will prove abortive, and, like kicking again&s;t the &s;pikes wound and torment thy&s;elf the more."</P>
<P>BEING now &s;ufficiently convinced of his folly in acting again&s;t JESUS, whom he was now a&s;&s;ured to be the true Me&s;&s;iah, Saul a&s;ked, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</HI> On which the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS informed him of the true intention of his appearance, 'Ari&s;e, &s;aid he, and &s;tand upon thy feet; for I have appeared unto thee for this purpo&s;e, to make thee a mini&s;ter and a witne&s;s, both of the&s;e things which thou ha&s;t &s;een, and of tho&s;e things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I &s;end thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgive|ne&s;s of &s;ins, and inheritance among&s;t them which are &s;anctified by faith that is in me,' Acts xxvi.16, 17, 18. And for further in&s;truction, the immaculate JESUS referred him to one of his followers, named Ananias, commanding him to repair immediately to the city, and receive further in&s;truction from that di&s;ciple.</P>
<P>THE men who were with him heard the voice, but did not &s;ee the per&s;on who &s;pake from heaven: in all probability they were ignorant of the Hebrew language, and there|fore only heard a confu&s;ed &s;ound; for the apo&s;tle him&s;elf tells us, that they heard not the voice of him that &s;pake, that is, they did not hear it with a proper degree of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>SAUL now aro&s;e from the earth, but found him&s;elf deprived of &s;ight, the re&s;plendent brightne&s;s of the vi&s;ion being too inten&s;e for mortal eyes to behold. His companions therefore led him by the hand to the city of Dama&s;cus, where he entered the hou&s;e of Judas, and remained there three days without &s;ight, nor did he either eat or drink but &s;pent his time in prayer to the Almighty, be&s;eeching him to pardon the &s;ins of his pa&s;t life, and be gracious to him.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, in the mean time appeared in a vi&s;ion to Ananias, a very devout and religious man, highly e&s;teemed by all the inhabitants of Dama&s;cus, though he pro|fe&s;&s;ed the religion of the crucified JESUS commanding him to go into &s;uch a &s;treet of the city, and enquire in the hou&s;e of Judas, for one Saul of Tar&s;us, then offering up the mo&s;t fer|vent prayers to the throne of grace. Annias, who, was ever ready to obey the com|mands of the Mo&s;t High, &s;tartled at the name, having heard of his bloody practices at Jeru&s;alem, and what commi&s;&s;ion he was now come to execute in Dama&s;cus: he therefore &s;u&s;pected that his pretended conver&s;ion was nothing more than a &s;nare artfully laid for the Chri&s;tians. But our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;oon removed his apprehen&s;ions, by telling him that his &s;u&s;picions were entirely de&s;titute of foundation; and that he had now taken him as a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el to preach the go&s;pel both to the Jews and Gentiles, and even before the greate&s;t monarchs of the earth; acquainting him, at the &s;ame time, with the great things he &s;hould do and &s;uffer for the &s;ake of the go&s;pel, what chains and impri&s;onments, what racks and &s;courges, what hunger and thir&s;t, what &s;hipwrecks, and that, at la&s;t, he &s;hould even &s;uffer death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE fears of Ananias being thus quieted, he immediately obeyed the heavenly vi&s;ion, repaired to the hou&s;e of Judas, and laid hands upon Saul, &s;aying, "That JESUS who
<PB N="305" REF="029927_0326_0FE33975510E0B08">
appeared to thee in the way, hath &s;ent me to re&s;tore thy &s;ight, and, by the infu&s;ion of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pirit, to give thee the knowledge of tho&s;e truths which thou ha&s;t blindly and ig|norantly per&s;ecuted; but who now is willing to receive thee by bapti&s;m into his church, and make thee a member of his body."</P>
<P>THIS &s;peech was no &s;ooner pronounced, than there fell from his eyes thick films re&s;embling &s;cales, and he received his &s;ight, and after bapti&s;m conver&s;ed freely with the Chri&s;tians of Dama&s;cus. Nor did he only conver&s;e with them; he al&s;o to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the whole church, preached the go&s;pel to tho&s;e Chri&s;tians he came down with an intention to de&s;troy, boldly a&s;&s;erting, <HI>that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t, the Son of God;</HI> and proving it to the Jews with &s;uch demon&s;trative evidence, that they were confounded, and found it impo&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer him, or di&s;prove his arguments.</P>
<P>ST. Paul did not &s;tay long at Dama&s;cus after his conver&s;ion; nor did he return to Jeru&s;alem; but being commanded to preach the go&s;pel to the Gentiles, he retired into Arabia Petrae, where he received a full revelation of all the my&s;teries of Chri&s;tianity; for he him&s;elf declares, that he conver&s;ed not with fle&s;h and blood. And having preach|ed in &s;everal parts of that country &s;ome time, he returned again to Dama&s;cus, applying him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity to the great work of the mini&s;try, frequenting the &s;ynagogues there, powerfully confuting the objections commonly made by the de&s;cen|dants of Jacob again&s;t JESUS of Nazareth, and converting great numbers of Jews and Gentiles to the faith.</P>
<P>THIS apo&s;tle was indeed remarkably zealous in his preaching, and ble&s;&s;ed with a very extraordinary method of rea&s;oning, whereby he proved the fundamental points of Chri&s;tianity beyond exception. This irritated the Jews to the highe&s;t degree: and, at length, after two or three years continuance in tho&s;e parts, they found means to pre|vail on the governor of Dama&s;cus to have him put to death: but they knew it would be difficult to take him, as he had &s;o many friends in the city; they therefore kept them&s;elves a continual watch, &s;earched all the hou&s;es where they &s;uppo&s;ed he might conceal him&s;elf, and al&s;o obtained a guard from the governor to ob&s;erve the gates, in order to prevent his e&s;caping from the place.</P>
<P>HIS Chri&s;tian friends were far from de&s;erting him in this di&s;tre&s;s; they tried every method that offered to procure his e&s;cape: but finding it impo&s;&s;ible for him to pa&s;s through either of the gates of the city, they let him down from one of their hou&s;es through a window in a ba&s;ket, over the wall, by which means the cruel de&s;igns of his enemies were rendered ineffectual. St. Paul having thus e&s;caped from his malicious per&s;ecutors, repaired to Jeru&s;alem, and, on his arrival, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the church: but they knowing well the former temper and principles of this great per&s;ecutor, &s;hun|ned his company, till Barnabas brought him to Peter, who was not yet ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and to James our Lord's brother, bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem, informing them of his miracu|lous conver&s;ion, and that he had preached the go&s;pel with the greate&s;t boldne&s;s in the &s;ynagogue of Dama&s;cus; upon which they gladly received him, and entertained him fifteen days with the greate&s;t ho&s;pitality and affection.</P>
<P>HE was remarkably a&s;&s;iduous during this interval, in preaching the go&s;pel of the Son of God, and confuting the Helleni&s;tic Jews, with the greate&s;t courage and re&s;olu|tion. But &s;nares were &s;oon laid for him, as malice can as ea&s;ily cea&s;e to be, as to re|main inactive; and being warned by God in a vi&s;ion, that his te&s;timony would not be received at Jeru&s;alem, and therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to depart and preach the go&s;pel to the Gentiles. Accordingly, being conducted by the brethren to Cae&s;area

Philippi, he &s;et &s;ail for Tar&s;us, his native city; from whence he was &s;oon after broug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> by Barnabas to Antioch, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in propagating Chri&s;tianity in that city. In this employment he &s;pent one whole year, and had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the go&s;pel flouri&s;h in a very remarkable manner in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>HERE the di&s;ciples fir&s;t acquired the name of Chri&s;tians, for before they were &s;tyled Nazareens; but this appellation &s;oon prevailed all over the world, and the former wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a few ages, almo&s;t entirely laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>A terrible famine, foretold by Hygabus, happened about this time, in &s;everal parts of the Roman empire, particularly in Judea; which induced the Chri&s;tians at Antioch to compa&s;&s;ionate the mi&s;eries of their brethren at Jeru&s;alem; and, accordingly rai&s;ed con&s;iderable contributions for their relief, which they &s;ent to the capital of Judea by the hands of Barnabas and Saul who, immediately after executing their commi&s;&s;ion, returned to Antioch. But while they were performing the public exerci&s;es of religion, it was revealed to them by the Holy Gho&s;t, that they &s;hould &s;et apart Barnabas and Saul to preach the go&s;pel in other places, which was accordingly done, and they were immediately deputed for that &s;ervice by prayer, fa&s;ting, and the impo&s;ition of hands.</P>
<P>THEY fir&s;t of all vi&s;ited Seleucia, where they did not continue long, but &s;ailed for Cyprus; and at Salamis, a great city in that i&s;land, they preached in the &s;ynagogue of the Jews. From hence they removed to Paphos, the re&s;idence of Sergius Paulus, the procon&s;ul of the i&s;land, a man of great wi&s;dom and prudence, but mi&s;erably &s;e|duced by the wicked artifices of Bar-Je&s;us, a Jewi&s;h impo&s;ter, who &s;tyled him&s;elf Elymas, or the magician, vehemently oppo&s;ed the apo&s;tles, and kept the procon&s;ul from embracing the faith, as preached by them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the procon&s;ul called for the apo&s;tles, who, after &s;everely checking Ely|mas for his malicious oppo&s;ition to the truth, told him the divine vengeance was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ready to &s;eize upon him; and immediately he was deprived of his &s;ight. The ven|geance of the Almighty, in depriving him of the u&s;e of his bodily eyes, bore a remark|able analogy to the blindne&s;s of tho&s;e of his mind, which were &s;o wilfully and malici|ou&s;ly &s;hut again&s;t the light of the go&s;pel, and al&s;o endeavoured to keep others in dark|ne&s;s and ignorance. This miracle convinced the procon&s;ul of the truth of the doctrine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> taught by the apo&s;tles and made him a convert to Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>AFTER this remarkable &s;ucce&s;s in Cyprus, St. Paul repaired to Phrygia and Pamphili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and taking Titus with him in the room of Mark, who was gone to Jeru&s;alem, travel|led to Antioch, the metropolis of Pi&s;idia. Soon after their arrival, they entered the &s;ynagogue of the Jews on the Sabbath-day, and after the reading of the law, Paul being invited by the rulers of the Synagogue, delivered him&s;elf in the following manner: "Hearken, all ye de&s;cendants of Jacob, and ye that fear the Almighty, to the words of my mouth. The God of I&s;rael made choice of our fathers, and loved them, when they had no city of their own to dwell in, but were &s;trangers and &s;laves in Egypt, bringing them from thence with a mighty hand and a &s;trethed out arm; fed them in the wilderne&s;s forty years, and would not &s;uffer his anger to ri&s;e again&s;t them, though they often provoked him in the de&s;ert. On their arrival in the land he promi&s;ed their fathers, he de&s;troyed the nations that inhabited it, and placed them in that fruitful country, dividing it to them by lot, for their inheritance.</P>

death he placed David on the throne of I&s;rael, giving him this te&s;timony, 'I have found David the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e, a man after mine own heart, which &s;hall fulfil all my will. And according to his promi&s;e, the Almighty hath rai&s;ed up to the &s;ons of David a Saviour JESUS, which is CHRIST the Lord. The bapti&s;m of repentance having been preached before his coming by John: and as the forerunner executed his office, he a&s;ked his followers, <HI>Whom think ye that I am?</HI> You mu&s;t not mi&s;take me for the Me&s;&s;iah; he will &s;oon follow me, but I am not worthy to perform the meane&s;t office for him.</P>

They found indeed no fault in him, though they earne&s;tly de&s;ired Pilate that he might be crucified.</P>
<P>"EVERY thing that had been written by the prophets concerning him, being now fulfilled, they took him from the tree, and depo&s;ited his body in the chambers of the grave: but death had no power to detain him: his Almighty Father rai&s;ed him from the habitations of the dead. After which, he was &s;een during many days by his di&s;|ciples who attended him from Galilee, and who are the witne&s;&s;es, cho&s;en by Omnipo|tence, of the&s;e great and miraculous works. And we now declare unto you glad-tidings namely, That the promi&s;e made by the Almighty to our forefathers, he hath perform|ed to us their children, by rai&s;ing JESUS from the dead. The prophet David al&s;o &s;aid, <HI>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</HI> He al&s;o foretold, that he &s;hould return from the chambers of the du&s;t, and no more be &s;ubject to corruption: <HI>I will give him,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>the &s;ure mercies of David.</HI> And again, <HI>Thou &s;halt not &s;uffer thine Holy one to &s;ee corruption.</HI> Now this prophecy mu&s;t relate to the Me&s;&s;iah, for David him&s;elf, after he had &s;wayed the &s;ceptre of I&s;rael a certain time, fell a&s;leep, was depo&s;ited in the chambers of the grave, and his fle&s;h &s;aw corruption: but the great Son of David, whom the Almighty rai&s;ed from the dead, never &s;aw corruption, as it was written of him.</P>
<P>"THEREFORE, be it known unto you, men and brethren, that through this Saviour is preached unto you the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins: it is by his merits we are ju&s;tified from all things, which was impo&s;&s;ible by the law of Mo&s;es.

<P>THE apo&s;tle's &s;peech had the de&s;ired effect; for &s;everal of the Jews, who were con|vinced of the truth, de&s;ired to hear him on the next Sabbath, and the apo&s;tles per&s;uad|ed them to continue firm in the belief of the&s;e things. The en&s;uing Sabbath, almo&s;t the whole city flocked to hear the apo&s;tles; at which the Jews were filled with envy, and contradicted Paul, uttering many bla&s;phemous expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the name of JESUS of Nazareth: but their oppo&s;ition could not daunt the apo&s;tles, who boldly declared, that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had charged them to preach the go&s;pel fir&s;t to the Jews; but as they &s;o ob&s;tinately rejected it, they were now to addr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> them&s;elves to the Gentiles; who, hearing this, rejoiced exceedingly, magnifying the word of the Almighty, and many of them embraced the doctrines of the go&s;pel. This increa&s;ed the malice and fury of the Jews, who, by fal&s;e and artful in&s;inuations, prevailed on &s;ome of the more devout and honourable women to bring over their hu&s;bands to the party; by which means, Paul and Barnabas were driven out of the city. At which the apo&s;tles departed, &s;haking off the du&s;t from their feet, as a te&s;timony of their ingratitude, infidelity, and rejection of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="029927_0329_0FE3397A10AB6138">THEY went from Antioch to Iconium, the metropolis of Lycaonia, a province of the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, where they again entered into the &s;ynagogue of the Jews, notwith&s;tanding the ill-treatment they had met with from the Jews in other places; for &s;o great was their zeal for the go&s;pel, that they were not to be deterred from preaching it by ill u&s;age, however great. Therefore, according to their u&s;ual method, they began their preach|ing in the a&s;&s;embly of I&s;raelites; and the Almighty &s;o far a&s;&s;i&s;ted their endeavours, that many, both Jews and pro&s;elytes, believed. Their &s;ucce&s;s encouraged them to continue a con&s;iderable time in this city, to in&s;truct the converts, and confirm their faith by mi|racles. But, though they had gained a con&s;iderable part of the city to the faith, yet many continued in their infidelity: the old leven of Jewi&s;h malice began again to fer|ment, and the unbelieving Jews, having &s;tirred up the Gentiles again&s;t the apo&s;tles, at la&s;t prevailed on the multitude to &s;tone them: but the apo&s;tles having timely notice of their de&s;ign, fled from the city, and travelled to Ly&s;tra, where they preached the go&s;pel to the inhabitants, and tho&s;e who dwelt in the country adjacent.</P>
<P>AT Ly&s;tra, there was a man among&s;t the converts, who had been lame from his mo|ther's womb, and never had walked: and Paul, perceiving that he had faith to be &s;aved, thought proper to add the cure of his body to that of his &s;oul, knowing that it would not only be beneficial to him, but to all the re&s;t of the believers, by confirming their faith: and, that the miracle might be wrought in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous manner, be, in the mid&s;t of the congregation, &s;aid in an audible voice to the man, <HI>Stand upright on thy feet:</HI> and the words were no &s;ooner pronounced, than his &s;trength was at once re&s;tored, and he leaped up and walked, prai&s;ing God.</P>
<P>THEY who were eye-witne&s;&s;es to this miracle well knew, that it was not wrought by any human power; but having been initiated into the &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;toms of the Hea|thens, cried out, in the &s;peech of Lycoania, <HI>The Gods are come down to us in the likene&s;s of men.</HI> And accordingly they called Barnabas Jupiter, becau&s;e of his venerable gravity, and Paul Mercury, from his oloquence. Nor was it long before the whole city re&s;ounded with acclamations; &s;o that almo&s;t all the inhabitants gathered them&s;elves together, and, preceded by the prie&s;t of Jupiter, and oxen dre&s;&s;ed in garlands, they came to the hou&s;e where the apo&s;tles were, intending to do &s;acrifice to them: But as &s;oon as Barnabas and Paul under&s;tood their intentions, they were greatly affected at this &s;uper|&s;titious attempt; and rending their clothes to expre&s;s their grief and abhorrance of the action, ran to them, crying out, "Ye men of Ly&s;tra, ye are mi&s;taken in the object of your wor&s;hip; for though we have done many miracles in the name, and by the power of CHRIST, yet we are no more than men, and &s;ubject to the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions as your&s;elves, and preach unto you the glad-tidings of &s;alvation, that ye may for&s;ake the vanities of this world, and turn to the living God, who created the heaven and the earth, the &s;ea, and all the creatures they contain. This Omnipotent being &s;uffered all nations formerly to walk in their own ways, though he never left him&s;elf without a witne&s;s, doing the greate&s;t good to the children of men; it is he that &s;endeth rain from heaven, and crown|eth the year with fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, filling our hearts with joy and gladne&s;s."</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle's argument had the de&s;ired effect; and the people were at la&s;t, though with difficulty, per&s;uaded to lay a&s;ide their intended idolatrous &s;acrifice; and &s;urely no argu|ment could be more proper to affect the minds of the audience.

<P>HOWEVER, they did not long continue at Derbe, but returned to Ly&s;tra, Iconium, and Antioch of Pi&s;idia, confirming the Chri&s;tians of tho&s;e places in the faith, earne&s;tly per|&s;uading them to per&s;evere, and not be di&s;couraged with tho&s;e troubles and per&s;ecutions which they mu&s;t expect would attend the profe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel. And that the affairs of the church might be conducted with more regularity, they ordained elders and pa&s;tors, to teach, to in&s;truct, and to watch over them; and then left them to the protection of the Almighty to who&s;e care they recommended them by fa&s;ting and prayer.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tles, after leaving Antioch, pa&s;&s;ed through Pi&s;idia, and came to Pamphylia; and after preaching the go&s;pel at Perga, they went down to Attalia. Having thus fini&s;hed the circuit of their mini&s;try, they returned back to Antioch in Syria, from whence they at fir&s;t departed. Here they &s;ummoned the church, and gave them an account of their mini&s;try, the &s;ucce&s;s it had met with in the&s;e different parts, and how great a door had thus been opened for the conver&s;ion of the Heathens.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="029927_0331_0FE33982F5E126E0">DURING St. Paul's &s;tay at Antioch, that famous controver&s;y, relating to the ob&s;erva|tion of the Jewi&s;h ceremonies in the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, was &s;et on foot by certain Jewi&s;h converts, to the great di&s;turbance of the whole church. And it was determined to &s;end Paul and Barnabas to con&s;ult with the Apo&s;tles and church at Jeru&s;alem, that this affair might be &s;ettled on the mo&s;t &s;olid foundation. On their arrival at Jeru&s;alem, they fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to Peter, James, and John, the pillars of that church, by whom they were kindly entertained, and kindly admitted to the right-hand of fellow&s;hip. And perceiving by the account given them by St. Paul, that the go&s;pel of the uncircumci&s;ion was committed to him, as that of the circumci&s;ion was to Peter, they agreed that Peter &s;hould preach to the Jews, and Paul to the Gentiles. This being determined, a council was &s;ummoned, wherein Peter declared his opinion, and Paul and Barnabas acquainted them with the great things God by their mini&s;try, had done among&s;t the Gentiles. A plain evidence, that they were accepted by the Almighty, though uncircumci&s;ed, as well as the Jews with all their legal rights and privileges. Accordingly, it was unanimou&s;ly determined, that the Gentiles were not under the obligation of the law of Mo&s;es, and therefore, for their fuller &s;atisfaction in this matter, it was agreed, that &s;ome per&s;ons of their own church &s;hould be joined with Paul and Barnabas, to carry the decrees of the council to Antioch.</P>
<P>ST. PAUL and his companions, having received the decretal epi&s;tle, returned back to Antioch; and &s;oon after Peter him&s;elf came down. On reading this epi&s;tle in the church the converts conver&s;ed freely and inoffen&s;ively with the Gentiles, till &s;ome of the Jews coming thither from Jeru&s;alem, Peter withdrew his conver&s;ation, as if it had been a thing unwarrantable and unlawful. By &s;uch a &s;trange method of proceding, the minds of many were di&s;&s;atisfied, and their con&s;ciences very unea&s;y. St. Paul, with the greate&s;t concern, ob&s;erved it, and publicly rebuked Peter with that &s;harpne&s;s and &s;everity his un|warrantable practice called for on &s;uch an important occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>PAUL and Barnabas, &s;oon after this di&s;pute, re&s;olved to vi&s;it the churches they had planted among&s;t the Gentiles, and Barnabas was de&s;irous of taking with them his cou&s;in Mark: but this Paul &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, as he had left them in their former journey. This trifling di&s;pute aro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that the&s;e two great apo&s;tles and fellow-la|bourers in the go&s;pel parted a&s;under; Barnabas, taking Mark with him repaired to Cyprus his native country; and Paul, having made choice of Silas, and recommended the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his undertaking to the care of Divine Providence, &s;et forward on his intended journey.</P>
<P>ST. PAUL and Silas fir&s;t vi&s;ited the churches of Syria and Cilicia, confirming them in the faith, by their in&s;tructions and exhortations. Hence they &s;ailed to Crete, where Paul preached the go&s;pel, and con&s;tituted Titus to be the fir&s;t bi&s;hop and pa&s;tor of that i&s;land, leaving him to &s;ettle tho&s;e affairs of the church which time would not permit the apo&s;tle to &s;ettle him&s;elf. From hence Paul and Silas returned back into Cilicia, and came to Ly&s;tra, where they found Timothy, who&s;e father was a Greek but his mother a Jewi&s;h convert, and by her he had been brought up under all the advantages of a pious and re|ligious education, e&s;pecially with regard to the Holy Scriptures, which he had &s;tudied with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;iduity and &s;ucce&s;s. This per&s;on St. Paul de&s;igned for the companion of his travels, and a &s;pecial in&s;trument in the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel: but knowing that his being uncircumci&s;ed would prove a &s;tumbling block to the Jews, cau&s;ed him to be circumci&s;ed; being willing in lawful and indifferent matters, in order to &s;ave the &s;ouls of men, to conform him&s;elf to their tempers, apprehen&s;ions, and prejudices.</P>
<P>ST. PAUL and his companions now departed from Ly&s;tra, pa&s;&s;ing through Phrygia and the country of Galatia, where the apo&s;tle was entertained with the greate&s;t kindne&s;s and veneration, the people looking upon him as an angel &s;ent immediately from heaven;
<PB N="311" REF="029927_0332_0FE33984786FE810">
and being by revelation forbidden to go into A&s;ia, he was commanded by a &s;econd vi&s;ion to repair to Macedonia, to preach the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, our apo&s;tle prepared to pa&s;s from A&s;ia into Europe. Here St. Luke joined them, and became ever after the in&s;eparable companion of St. Paul, who being de&s;irous of finding the &s;peedie&s;t pa&s;&s;age into Macedonia, took &s;hip with his companions Silas, Luke and Timothy, and came to Samothracia, an i&s;land in the Aegean &s;ea, not far from Thrace; and the next day to Neapolis, a port of Macedonia. Leaving Neapolis they repaired to Philippi, the metropolis of that part of Macedonia, and Roman colony, where, for &s;ome days, they re&s;ided.</P>
<P>PAUL, according to his con&s;tant practice, preached in a Pro&s;eucha or oratory of the Jews, which &s;tood by the river &s;ide, at &s;ome di&s;tance from this city, and was much fre|quented by the devout women of their religion, who met there to pray and hear the law. To the&s;e St. Paul preached the glad-tidings of the go&s;pel; and, by the influence of the Holy Spirit, converted many, e&s;pecially a certain woman named Lydia, a Jewi&s;h pro&s;e|lyte, a &s;eller of purple in that city, but a native of Thyatira. This woman being bap|tized with her whole family, was &s;o importunate with St. Paul and his companions to abide at her hou&s;e, that they were con&s;trained to accept of her invitation.</P>
<P>WHILE the apo&s;tles re&s;ided at Philippi, they continued their daily cour&s;e of wor&s;hip|ping at the &s;ame oratory. And after &s;everal days, as they were repairing to the &s;ame place of devotion, there met them a dam&s;el who had a prophetic &s;pirit of divination, by whom her ma&s;ters acquired very great advantage. This woman followed Paul and his companions, crying out, <HI>The&s;e men are the &s;ervants of the Mo&s;t High God, which &s;hew unto us the way to &s;alvation.</HI> Paul, at fir&s;t, took no notice of her, not being willing to multiply miracles without nece&s;&s;ity: but when he &s;aw her following them &s;everal days together, he began to be troubled; and in imitation of his great Ma&s;ter, who would not &s;uffer the devil to acknowledge him, le&s;t his fal&s;e and lying tongue &s;hould prejudice the truth in the minds of men, commanded the &s;pirit, in the name of JESUS, to come out of her. The devil with reluctance obeyed, and left the dam&s;el immediately.</P>
<P>AS this miraculous cure proved a great lo&s;s to her ma&s;ters, who acquired large gains from her &s;ooth&s;aying, they were filled with malice and envy again&s;t the apo&s;tles; and, by their in&s;tigation, the multitude aro&s;e, and, &s;eizing upon Paul and his companions, hurried them before the magi&s;trates and governors of the colony; accu&s;ing them of introducing many innovations which were prejudicial to the &s;tate, and unlawful for them to comply with, as being Romans. The magi&s;trates being concerned for the tranquility of the &s;tate, and jealous of all di&s;turbances, were very forward to puni&s;h the offenders, again&s;t whom the multitude te&s;tified; and therefore commanded the officers to &s;trip them and &s;courge them &s;everely, as per&s;ons who &s;tirred up &s;editions.</P>
<P>THE &s;entence was accordingly executed; after which the apo&s;tles were committed to clo&s;e cu&s;tody, the goaler receiving more than ordinary charge to keep them &s;afely; and he accordingly thru&s;t them into the inner pri&s;on, and made their feet fa&s;t in the &s;tocks: but the mo&s;t ob&s;cure dungeon, or the pitchy mantle of the night, cannot intercept the beams of divine joy and comfort from the &s;ouls of &s;uch pious men. Their minds were all &s;erenity, and at midnight they prayed and &s;ung prai&s;es &s;o loud, that they were heard in every part of the pri&s;on: nor were their prayers offered to the throne of grace in vain; an earthquake &s;hook the foundations of the pri&s;on, opened the doors, loo&s;ed the chains, and &s;et the pri&s;oners at liberty. This convul&s;ion of nature rou&s;ed the goaler from his &s;leep; and concluding from what he &s;aw, that all his pri&s;oners were e&s;caped, was going to put a period to his life; but Paul, ob&s;erving him, ha&s;tily cried out, <HI>Do thy&s;elf no harm, for we are all here.</HI> The keeper was now as greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at the goodne&s;s of
<PB N="312" REF="029927_0333_0FE33986019BA2E8">
the apo&s;tles, as he was before terrified at the thoughts of their e&s;cape; and calling for a light, he came immediately into the pre&s;ence of the apo&s;tles, fell down at their feet, took them from the dungeon, brought them into his own hou&s;e, wa&s;hed their &s;tripes, and beg|ged of them to in&s;truct him in the knowledge of that God who was mighty to &s;ave and deliver.</P>
<P>THE goaler's reque&s;t was readily granted by St. Paul, who replied, That, if he be|lieved in JESUS CHRIST, he might be &s;aved, with his whole hou&s;e. Accordingly, the goaler, with all his family, were, after a competent in&s;truction, baptized, and received as members of the church of CHRIST. How happy a change does the doctrine of the go&s;|pel make in the minds of men! How does it &s;mooth the roughe&s;t tempers, and in&s;til the &s;weete&s;t principles of civility and good-nature into the minds of men! He who but a few moments before, tyrannized over the apo&s;tles, now treated them with the greate&s;t re&s;pect, and the highe&s;t marks of kindne&s;s he was capable of &s;hewing.</P>
<P>WHEN it was day, the magi&s;trates, either hearing what had happened, or reflecting on what they had done, as too har&s;h and unju&s;tifiable, &s;ent their &s;erjeant to the goaler with orders to di&s;charge the apo&s;tles. The goaler joyfully delivered the me&s;&s;age, and bid them depart in peace: but Paul, that he might make the magi&s;trates &s;en&s;ible what injury they had done them, and how unju&s;tly they had puni&s;hed them without examina|tion or trial, &s;ent them word, that as they had thought proper to &s;courge and impri&s;on Romans, contrary to the laws of the empire, he expected they &s;hould come them&s;elves, and make them &s;ome &s;atisfaction for the illegal treatment they had received.</P>
<P>THIS me&s;&s;age terrified the magi&s;trates, who well knew how dangerous it was to pro|voke the formidable power of the Romans, who never &s;uffered any freeman to be beaten uncondemned; they came therefore to the pri&s;on, and very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively entreated the apo&s;tles to depart without any further di&s;turbance. This &s;mall recompence for the cruel u&s;age they had received was accepted by the meek followers of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS; they left the pri&s;on, and retired to the hou&s;e of Lydia, where they comforted their brethren with an account of their deliverance, and departed; having laid the foundation of a very eminent church, as appears from St. Paul's epi&s;tle to the church at Philippi.</P>
<P>PAUL and his companions leaving this city, continued their journey towards the we&s;t, till they came to The&s;&s;alonica, the capital of Macedonia, about an hundred and twenty miles from Philippi. On their arrival at The&s;&s;alonica, Paul, according to his cu&s;tom, went into the &s;ynagogue of the Jews, and preached unto his countrymen; the ungrate|ful u&s;age he had met with in other places, not di&s;couraging him from per&s;evering in &s;o glorious a work. His doctrine however was &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the Jews, who would not allow JESUS to be the Me&s;&s;iah, becau&s;e of the ignominious death which he had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tles during their &s;tay at The&s;&s;alonica, lodged in a hou&s;e of a certain Chri&s;|tian, named Ja&s;on, who entertained them very courteou&s;ly. But the Jews would not &s;uffer the apo&s;tles to continue at re&s;t; they refu&s;ed to embrace the go&s;pel them&s;elves, and therefore envied its &s;ucce&s;s, and determined to oppo&s;e its progre&s;s; accordingly, they gathered together a great number of lewd and wicked wretches, who be&s;et the hou&s;e of Ja&s;on, intending to take Paul, and deliver him up to an incen&s;ed multitude; but in this they were di&s;appointed, Paul and Silas being removed from thence by the Chri&s;tians, and concealed in &s;ome other part of the city. Their fury however was rather exa&s;perated than le&s;&s;ened at lo&s;ing their prey; and, as they could not find the apo&s;tles of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, they determined to be revenged on Ja&s;on, who had concealed them. Accordingly they &s;eized on him and &s;ome others of the brethren, and carried them before the magi&s;|trates
<PB N="313" REF="029927_0334_0FE3398E5C8B28D0">
of the city, accu&s;ing them, as they had before done the apo&s;tles them&s;elves at Phi|lippi, of di&s;turbing the peace of the empire, and &s;etting up JESUS as a king, in degrada|tion of the emperor's dignity and authority. This accu&s;ation induced both people and magi&s;trates to be their enemies; and though Ja&s;on was only accu&s;ed of harbouring tho&s;e innovators, yet the magi&s;trate could not be prevailed upon to di&s;mi&s;s him and his com|panions, till they had given &s;ecurity for their appearance when called upon.</P>
<P>WHEN the tumult was over, the The&s;&s;alonians, who had been converted by them, &s;ent away Paul and Silas by night to Beroea, a city about fifty miles &s;outh of The&s;&s;alonica, but out of the power of their enemies. Here al&s;o Paul's great love for his countrymen the Jews, and his earne&s;t de&s;ire for their &s;alvation, excited him to preach to them in parti|cular: accordingly, he entered into their &s;ynagogue, and explained the go&s;pel unto them, proving out of the Old Te&s;tament, the truth of the doctrines he advanced. The&s;e Jews were of a more candid and ingenious temper than tho&s;e of The&s;&s;alonica; and as they heard him with great reverence and attention expound and apply the Scriptures, &s;o they &s;earched diligently, whether his proofs were proper and pertinent, and con&s;onant to the &s;en&s;e of the texts he referred to: and having found every thing to be agreeable to what Paul had advanced, many of them believed; and &s;everal Gentiles, followed their example, became obedient to the faith, among&s;t whom were &s;everal women of quality. The news of this remarkable &s;ucce&s;s was carried to The&s;&s;alonica, and greatly incen&s;ed the inveterate enemies of the go&s;pel there; who accordingly repaired to Beroea, and rai&s;ed tumults a|gain&s;t the apo&s;tles; &s;o that Paul, to avoid their fury, was forced to leave the town; but Silas and Timothy, either le&s;s known, or le&s;s envied, continued &s;till in the place.</P>
<P>LEAVING Beroea under the conduct of certain guides, it was pretended that Paul de|&s;igned to retire by &s;ea out of Greece, that his re&s;tle&s;s enemies might cea&s;e their per&s;e|cution: but the guides, according to his de&s;ire, brought him to Athens, and left him there, after receiving from him an order for Silas and Timothy to repair to him as &s;oon as they conveniently could.</P>
<P>AT this time Athens was the mo&s;t famous academy of all Greece, and abounding with philo&s;ophers illu&s;trious for their learning. Among&s;t the &s;everal &s;ects that now flouri&s;hed at Athens, the Stoics and Epicureans were the mo&s;t remarkable for their oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;tianity. The Epicureans becau&s;e they found their plea&s;ant and jovial humour, and their loo&s;e and exorbitant cour&s;e of life, &s;o greatly checked and controlled by the &s;trict and &s;evere precepts of the go&s;pel; and becau&s;e the doctrines of it &s;o plainly and po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted a Divine Providence governing the world, and which at the la&s;t day will reward or puni&s;h every man according to his works. The Stoics, on the other hand, though pre|tending to principles of great and uncommon &s;everity, and &s;uch as had the neare&s;t affinity to the doctrines of the go&s;pel, yet they found them very different in pactice. That meek and humble temper of mind, that mode&s;ty and &s;elf-denial, which the go&s;pel &s;o earne&s;tly recommends, and &s;o &s;trictly requires, were directly oppo&s;ite to the immoderate pride and ambition of that &s;ect, who were not a&s;hamed to affirm, that their &s;ages and philo&s;o|phers were not inferior to God him&s;elf in wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>DURING Paul's abode at Athens, expecting the arrival of Silas and Timothy, he walked up and down, to take a more accurate &s;urvey of the city, which he found mi&s;erably over|run with &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry. The inhabitants were remarkably religious and de|vout: they had a great number of gods, whom they adored; fal&s;e, indeed, they were, but &s;uch as they, being de&s;titute of revelation, accounted true: and &s;o very careful were they, that no deity &s;hould want due honour from them, that they had an altar in&s;cribed, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. A great variety of rea&s;ons are given for this in&s;cription: &s;ome affirm, that it was the name which the Pagans generally gave to the God of the Jews; but others think that, be&s;ides the unknown God, it included all the gods of A&s;ia, Europe, and Africa.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="029927_0335_0FE33990004630C0">THE &s;pirit of the apo&s;tle was grieved at the&s;e &s;uper&s;titious practices: he lamented to &s;ee &s;o much zeal and devotion mi&s;placed; and flattered him&s;elf, if he could but direct it to its proper object, it would be of eminent &s;ervice to the church of CHRIST. Accor|dingly, he exerted all his &s;trength for their conver&s;ion; di&s;puting on the &s;abbath-days in the &s;ynagogues of the Jews; and at other times took all opportunities of preaching to the Athenians the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah to &s;ave the world from &s;in and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle's doctrine was equally new and &s;trange to the Athenians; and though they did not per&s;ecute him as the Jews did, yet his preaching JESUS was con&s;idered by the Epicurean and Stoic philo&s;ophers as a fabulous legend; and by the more &s;ober part, as a di&s;covery of &s;ome new gods, which they had not yet placed in their temples: and though they were not unwilling to receive any new deities, yet as Areopagus, the &s;upreme court of the city, was to judge of all gods, to whom public wor&s;hip might be allowed, they brought him before tho&s;e judges, to give an account of his doctrine in their hearing.</P>
<P>BEING placed before the judges of this high a&s;&s;embly, St. Paul readily gave them an account of his doctrine, in a grave and elegant &s;peech; wherein he did not tell them they were horrible and gro&s;s idolators, le&s;t he &s;hould offend them, and thereby prevent them from li&s;tening to his rea&s;ons; but, having commended them for their religious di&s;po|&s;itions, he took occa&s;ion from the altar in&s;cribed to the unknown God, to make a proper defence of his doctrine. "I endeavour, &s;aid he, only to explain that altar to you, and manife&s;t the nature of that God whom ye ignorantly wor&s;hip; which is the God that made the world, and all things therein: and who being Lord of all, dwells not in temples made with hands, nor is to be wor&s;hipped in lifele&s;s idols. As he is the Cre|ator of all things, he cannot be confined to the workman&s;hip of man, whether temples or &s;tatues; nor &s;tands in need of &s;acrifices, &s;ince he is the fountain of life to all things. He made from one common original, the whole race of mankind, and hath wi&s;ely de|termined their dependance on him, that they might be obliged to &s;eek after him and &s;erve him. A truth perceivable in the darke&s;t &s;tate of ignorance, and acknowledged by one of your own poets. If this be the nature of God, it is &s;urely the highe&s;t ab&s;urdity to repre&s;ent him by any image or &s;imilitude. The divine patience hath been too much exerci&s;ed already with &s;uch gro&s;s abu&s;es in religion; but now expects a thorough refor|mation, having &s;ent his &s;on JESUS CHRIST to make him known to the world, and at the &s;ame time to inform them that he hath appointed a day of general judgment, when the religion of mankind &s;hall be tried by the te&s;t of the go&s;pel, before his only begotten Son, who is appointed &s;ole Judge of quick and dead, and who&s;e commi&s;&s;ion to that high office hath been ratified by the Almighty, in rai&s;ing him from the dead by his almighty power."</P>
<P>HE had no &s;ooner mentioned the re&s;urrection, than &s;ome of the philo&s;ophers mocked and derided him; others, more mode&s;t, but not &s;atisfied with the proofs he had given, gravely an&s;wered, <HI>We would hear thee again of this matter,</HI> After which Paul departed from the court; but not without &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s: for a few of his auditors believed and attended his in&s;tructions; among&s;t whom were Diony&s;ius one of the judges, and Damaris, thought by &s;ome to have been his wife. And it is generally believed that Diony&s;ius was after|wards con&s;tituted the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of Athens by this Apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>WHILE St. Paul remained at Athens, Timothy, according to the order he had received, came to him out of Macedonia, and brought an account that the Chri&s;tians at The&s;&s;alo|nica were under pro&s;ecution from their fellow citizens, ever &s;ince his departure, at which St. Paul was greatly concerned, and at fir&s;t inclined to vi&s;it them in per&s;on, to confirm them in the faith they had embraced; but being hindered by the enemies to the go&s;pel, he &s;ent Timothy to comfort them, and put them in mind of what they had at fir&s;t heard, namely, that per&s;ecution would be the con&s;tant attendant on their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="029927_0336_0FE3399186236D28">ST. PAUL left Athens on Timothy's departure, and travelled to Corinth, a very popu|lous place, and famous for its trade. Here he found Aquila, and Pri&s;cilla his wife, lately come from Italy, after having been bani&s;hed from Rome by a decree of Claudius; and they being of the &s;ame trade he him&s;elf had learned in his youth, he wrought with them, that he might not be burden&s;ome to the new converts in that city.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle after &s;ome &s;tay in Corinth, was joined by Silas and Timothy, and di&s;puted frequently in the &s;ynagogue, rea&s;oning and proving that JESUS was the true Me&s;&s;iah. This exa&s;perated the Jews to the greate&s;t degree, and what they could not conquer by argument and force of rea&s;on, they endeavoured to carry by noi&s;e and clamour, blended with bla&s;phemies and revilings; the la&s;t refuge of an impotent and baffled cau&s;e. But St. Paul, to te&s;tify his re&s;entment, &s;hook his garment, and told them, that &s;ince they were determined to pull down the vengeance of heaven upon their own heads, he was ab&s;olutely guiltle&s;s and innocent, and would henceforth addre&s;s him&s;elf to the Gentiles: accordingly he left them, and repaired to the hou&s;e of Ju&s;tus, a religious pro&s;elyte, where by his preaching and miracles, he converted great numbers to the faith; among&s;t which were Cri&s;pus the chief ruler of the &s;ynagogue, Gaius, and Stephanus, who with their families were bapti&s;ed, and admitted members of the church of CHRIST.</P>
<P>INASMUCH as the con&s;tant returns of malice and ingratitude are &s;ufficient to tire the large&s;t charity, and cool the mo&s;t generous re&s;olution; our dear Redeemer, therefore, that the apo&s;tle might not be di&s;couraged by the re&s;tle&s;s attempts and machinations of his enemies, appeared to him in a vi&s;ion, and told him, that notwith&s;tanding the bad &s;ucce&s;s he had hitherto met with, there was a large harve&s;t to be gathered in that place, that he &s;hould not be afraid of his enemies, but preach the go&s;pel boldly and faithfully, for that he him&s;elf would protect and pre&s;erve him from every danger.</P>
<P>ST. PAUL &s;eems about this time to have written his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alonians, Silas and Timothy being lately returned from thence, and delivered the me&s;&s;age for which he had &s;ent them thither. The principal de&s;ign of this epi&s;tle is, to confirm them in the belief of the Chri&s;tian religion, and excite them to per&s;evere in it, notwith&s;tanding al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the malice of their enemies, and the per&s;ecutions they mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer; and to in&s;truct them in the duties of their high vocation.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions, the malicious Jews were plotting his de&s;truction: but being for &s;ome time di&s;appointed, their malice changed into fury, and they hurried the apo&s;tle before the tribunal of Gallio, elder brother to the famous Seneca, and procon&s;ul of the province, accu&s;ing him of being an innovator in religion, and of endeavouring to intro|duce a method of wor&s;hipping God contrary to the law. Paul was ready to have made his defence; but Gallio prevented him by telling his accu&s;ers, that if he had been guilty of any inju&s;tice he would have heard their complaint and redre&s;&s;ed their grievance; but as it was nothing but a controver&s;y about words and names, he would have nothing to do with it. But the Jews continuing their clamour, he commanded his officers to drive them from the tribunal; which was accordingly done, and &s;ome of the town&s;men &s;eized upon Softhens one of the rulers of the &s;ynagogue, and beat him before the judgment-&s;eat, the procon&s;ul giving him&s;elf no concern about it. Thus were the de&s;igns of the apo&s;tle's enemies rendered abortive; and Paul continued, without any further oppo&s;ition, to preach the doctrine of the go&s;pel during a year and a half, when he left the church at Corinth, to vi&s;it others he had planted in different parts of the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>WHILE the apo&s;tle continued at Corinth he wrote his &s;econd Epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alo|nians, to &s;upply his ab&s;ence. In this Epi&s;tle he again endeavours to confirm their minds in the truth of the go&s;pel, and prevent their being &s;haken with tho&s;e troubles which the
<PB N="316" REF="029927_0337_0FE339930EBD21E0">
wicked and unbelieving Jews would be continually rai&s;ing again&s;t them. And becau&s;e &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in his former Epi&s;tle relating to the de&s;truction of the Jews had been mi&s;|under&s;tood, as if the day of the Lord was near at hand, he rectifies the&s;e mi&s;takes, and &s;hews the &s;ign that mu&s;t precede our Lord's coming to judgment in the latter days.</P>
<P>LEAVING the church at Corinth, St. Paul took &s;hip at Cenchrea, the port of Corinth, for Syria, taking with him Aquila and Pri&s;cilla; and on his arrival at Ephe&s;us, he preached a while in the &s;ynagogue of the Jews, promi&s;ing to return to them, after keep|ing the pa&s;&s;over at Jeru&s;alem. Accordingly, he again took &s;hip, and landed at Cae&s;area, and from thence travelled to Jeru&s;alem, where he kept the fea&s;t, vi&s;ited the church, and then repaired to Antioch: here he &s;tayed &s;ome time, and then traver&s;ed the countries of Gallatia and Phrygia, till he came to Ephe&s;us, confirming the new-converted Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>WHILE the apo&s;tle was taking this large circuit, Providence took care of the churches of Ephe&s;us and Corinth, by means of one Apollos, an eloquent Jew of Alexandria, and well acquainted with the law and writings of the prophets. This man coming to Ephe|&s;us, though he was only in&s;tructed in the rudiments of Chri&s;tianity, and John's bapti&s;m; yet he taught with great courage, and a mo&s;t powerful zeal. After being fully in&s;tructed in the faith by Aquila and Pri&s;cilla, he pa&s;&s;ed over into Achaia, being furni&s;hed with recommendatory letters, by the churches of Ephe&s;us and Corinth. He was of the greate&s;t &s;ervice in Achaia, in watering what Paul had planted, confirming the di&s;ciples, and powerfully convincing the Jews, that JESUS was the true Me&s;&s;iah promi&s;ed in the &s;criptures of the Old Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>LEAVING Apollos thus u&s;efully employed, St. Paul returned to Ephe&s;us, where he fixed his abode for three years, bringing with him Gaius of Derbe, Ari&s;tarchus a native of The&s;&s;alonica, Timotheus and Era&s;tus of Corinth, and Titus. The fir&s;t thing he did after his arrival was to examine certain di&s;ciples, whether they had received the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ince they believed? To which they an&s;wered, 'That the doctrine they had re|ceived, promi&s;ed nothing of that nature; nor had they ever heard that &s;uch an extraor|dinary &s;pirit had of late been be&s;towed upon the church.' This an&s;wer &s;urprized the apo&s;tle, who a&s;ked them in what name they had been bapti&s;ed; &s;ince, in the Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">an form, the name of the Holy Gho&s;t was always expre&s;&s;ed? They replied, that they had only received John's bapti&s;m; which, though it enjoined men to repent, yet mentioned nothing expre&s;sly concerning the Holy Gho&s;t, or its gifts or powers. Upon which the apo&s;tle informed them, that though John's babti&s;m commanded nothing but re|pentance, yet it tacitly implied the whole doctrine of CHRIST and the Holy Gho&s;t. When they heard this, they were bapti&s;ed according to the form pre&s;cribed by CHRIST him&s;elf, that is, in the name of the ble&s;&s;ed Trinity; and after the apo&s;tle had prayed and laid his hands upon them, they received the gifts of tongues and other miraculous powers.</P>
<P>ST. PAUL, after this, entered into the Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogues, where for the fir&s;t three months, he contende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and di&s;puted with the Jews, endeavouring with great earne&s;tne&s;s and re&s;olution to convince them of the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion. But when in&s;tead of &s;ucce&s;s he met with nothing but ob&s;tinacy and infidelity, he left the &s;ynagogue, and taking tho&s;e with him whom he had converted, in&s;tructed them and others who re&s;orted to him, in the &s;chool of one Tyrannus, a place where &s;cholars u&s;ed to be in&s;tructed. In this manner he continued to preach the go&s;pel two whole years; by which means the Jews and pro&s;elytes of the whole procon&s;ular of A&s;ia had an opportunity of hearing the glad-tidings of &s;alvation. And becau&s;e miracles are the cleare&s;t evidence of a divine commi&s;&s;ion, the Almighty was plea&s;ed to ratify the doctrine which St. Paul delivered by amazing and miraculous operations, many of which were of a peculiar and extraordinary
<PB N="317" REF="029927_0338_0FE3399A61515F88">
nature; for he did not only heal tho&s;e that come to him, but if napkins or handker|chiefs were only touched by him, and applied to the &s;ick, their di&s;ea&s;es immediately va|ni&s;hed, and the evil &s;pirits departed out of tho&s;e whom they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle about this time wrote his Epi&s;tle to the Galatians; for he had heard that &s;ince his departure, corrupt opinions had crept in among&s;t them, with regard to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving the legal rites; and that &s;everal impo&s;tors had found admittance into that church, who knew no better method of undermining the doctrine he had planted there, than by vilifying his per&s;on, &s;lighting him only as an apo&s;tle at &s;econd hand, not to be compared with Peter, James, and John, who had familiarly conver&s;ed with CHRIST in the days of his fle&s;h, and been immediately deputed by him.</P>
<P>IN this epi&s;tle he reproves them with &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary &s;everity, for their being &s;o &s;oon led out of the right way, wherein he had placed them, and &s;o ea&s;ily &s;uffered them&s;elves to be impo&s;ed upon by the crafty artifices of &s;educers. He vindicates the honour of his apo&s;tle&s;hip, and the immediate receiving his commi&s;&s;ion from CHRIST, wherein he &s;hews, that he was not inferior to the very be&s;t of his apo&s;tles. He largely refutes tho&s;e Judaical opinions that had tainted and infected them; and in the conclu&s;ion, in&s;tructs them in the rules and duties of a holy life.</P>
<P>WHILE St. Paul re&s;ided at Ephe&s;us, an accident happened which was attended with great trouble and danger. In this city was the celebrated temple of Diana, a &s;tructure &s;o magnificent for beauty, riches, and magnitude, that it was reckoned one of the &s;even wonders of the world: but what increa&s;ed its fame and reputation was an image of Diana kept there, which the idolatrous prie&s;ts per&s;uaded the people was made by Jupiter him&s;elf, and dropt down from heaven; for which rea&s;on it was held in great veneration, not only at Ephe&s;us, but throughout all A&s;ia: &s;o that people procured &s;ilver &s;hrines, or figures of this temple; of &s;uch a &s;ize as to carry in their pockets, either for curio&s;ity, or to &s;tir up their devotion. This proved the &s;ource of a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s to the &s;ilver&s;miths of Ephe&s;us, of whom one Demetrius was the chief: this man plainly per|ceiving, that Chri&s;tianity tended to the &s;ubver&s;ion of idolatry, and, con&s;equently, to the ruin of their gainful employment, called all the arti&s;ts together, and pathetically repre|&s;ented to them, "How inevitably they mu&s;t be reduced to a &s;tate of poverty, if they &s;uffered Paul to bring their temple and godde&s;s into contempt, by per&s;uading people, as he did, that they were no gods which were made by the hands of men."</P>
<P>ON hearing this &s;peech of Demetrius, the people were fired with a zeal which they could no longer contain; &s;o that they cried out with one voice, <HI>Great is Diana of the Ephe&s;ians.</HI> They &s;hould, indeed, have con&s;idered, that if their godde&s;s was able to defend her&s;elf again&s;t the doctrines preached by Paul, neither &s;he nor the temple were in danger; whereas, if Paul was able to de&s;troy their gods, it was in vain for them to re&s;i&s;t him: but intere&s;t and &s;uper&s;tition meeting in the minds of a biggotted multitude, admitted of no rea&s;on; they were all fired with zeal for their godde&s;s, and determined, if they could find Paul, to expo&s;e him to the bea&s;ts in the theatre. The whole city was filled with the tumult; and the crowd, mi&s;&s;ing Paul, laid hold on Gaius and Ari&s;tarchus, two Mace|donians of Paul's company, and hurried them into the theatre, with a de&s;ign to throw them to the wild bea&s;ts: Paul who was at pre&s;ent in a place of &s;ecurity, hearing of the danger to which his brethren were expo&s;ed, was very de&s;irous of venturing after them, in order to &s;peak in their behalf; but was at la&s;t di&s;&s;uaded from it, not only by the Chri&s;tians, but al&s;o by the Gentile governors of the theatrical games, who were his friends, and a&s;&s;ured him, that he would only endanger him&s;elf, without re&s;cuing his friends, or affording them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="029927_0339_0FE3399CC2E00DB0">THE multitude were now prodigiou&s;ly clamorous and confu&s;ed, mo&s;t of them not knowing the rea&s;on for which they were come together; and, therefore, &s;ome cried one thing, and &s;ome another. In this di&s;traction, Alexander, a Jewi&s;h convert, was &s;ingled out by the multitude, and by the in&s;tigation of the Jews was going to make his defence, in which doubtle&s;s, he would have laid the whole blame upon Paul: but the multitude perceiving him to be a Jew, and therefore &s;u&s;pecting he was one of Paul's a&s;&s;ociates, rai&s;ed another outcry for near two hours together, wherein nothing could be heard but <HI>Great is Diana of the Ephe&s;ians.</HI> This confu&s;ion brought the town-clerk, who kept the regi&s;ter of the games, into the theatre, to &s;uppre&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;o uncommon a tumult; and having with great difficulty, obtained &s;ilence, calmly and di&s;cretely told them, "That the world was &s;ufficiently acquainted with the devotion paid by the Ephe&s;ians to the great godde&s;s Diana, and the image which fell down from Jupiter; and therefore it was ab&s;olutely needle&s;s for them to publi&s;h it at that time; that if Demetrius and his fraternity had any thing to alledge again&s;t Paul and his companions, the court were open, and they might bring their accu&s;ation again&s;t them; or, if they were que&s;tioned with regard to the breach of any of their laws, the cau&s;e ought to be heard in a regular a&s;&s;embly. That they would do well to con&s;ider this, and be quiet; having already rendered them&s;elves obnoxious to the di&s;plea&s;ure of the magi&s;trates, if they did think proper to call them to an account for the tumult which they had that day occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>THE multitude, on hearing this di&s;cour&s;e, were convinced that they had acted very improperly, and therefore repaired to their re&s;pective habitations; and Gaius, Ari&s;tar|chus, and Alexander, were relea&s;ed without any hurt: but the e&s;cape of Paul was &s;o very remarkable, that he mentions it as a miraculous deliverance. <HI>We had,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the &s;entence of death in our&s;elves, that we &s;hould not tru&s;t in our&s;elves, but in God which rai&s;eth the dead, who delivered us from &s;o great a death.</HI> And in another place he tells us, <HI>he fought with bea&s;ts at Ephe&s;us;</HI> alluding, either to the de&s;ign of the enraged multitude, of throw|ing him to the wild bea&s;ts in the theatre, though their intention was not executed; or to the manners of the people, who &s;ufficiently de&s;erved the character of being &s;avage and brutal in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the words.</P>
<P>PAUL about this time, was informed of &s;ome di&s;turbances in the church of Corinth, hatched and fomented by a company of fal&s;e teachers, crept in among&s;t them, who endeavoured to draw them into parties and factions, by per&s;uading one company to be for Peter, another for Paul, and a third for Apollos; as if the principal part of religion con&s;i&s;ted in being of this or that denomination, or in a warm active zeal to depreciate and oppo&s;e whoever is not for our own narrow &s;ect. It is a very weak and &s;lender claim, when a man holds his religion by no better title than his having joined him&s;elf to &s;uch or &s;uch a &s;ect or congregation, and is remarkably zealous to promote it; to be childi&s;hly and pa&s;&s;ionately clamorous for &s;ome per&s;on's particular mode of admini&s;tration, or &s;ome particular opinion; as if religion rather con&s;i&s;ted in curious di&s;putes, or in &s;eparating from our brethren, than in righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. By the&s;e means, &s;chi&s;ms and factions broke into the Corinthian church, whereby many wild and extravagant opinions, and &s;ome of them &s;uch as tended to un|dermine the fundamenta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> articles of Chri&s;tianity, were planted, and had taken root there. To cure the&s;e di&s;tempers, St. Paul wrote his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, wherein he &s;martly reproves them for their &s;chi&s;ms and parties, conjures them to follow after peace and unity, corrects tho&s;e gro&s;s corruptions that had been introduced among&s;t them, and particularly re&s;olves tho&s;e many ca&s;es and controver&s;ies, wherein they had reque&s;ted his advice.</P>
<P>APOLLOS &s;oon after determining to go to Crete together with Zenos, St. Paul &s;ent by them his Epi&s;tle to Titus, whom he had made bi&s;hop of that i&s;land, and had left there for
<PB N="319" REF="029927_0340_0FE3399E48E62708">
propagating the go&s;pel. In this Epi&s;tle, he in&s;tructs him fully in the execution of his office, how to behave him&s;elf, and what directions he &s;hould give to others, in the &s;everal relations and ranks of men, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who were to be advanced to places of office and authority in the church, among&s;t the Gentiles.</P>
<P>THE tumult at Athens had not long &s;ub&s;ided, before Paul called the Chri&s;tians toge|ther, and took his leave of them with the mo&s;t tender expre&s;&s;ions of love and affection. He had now &s;pent almo&s;t three years at Ephe&s;us, and founded there a very con&s;iderable church, of which he had ordained Timothy the fir&s;t bi&s;hop. He fir&s;t travelled about two hundred miles northward to Troas, before he took &s;hip, expecting to meet Titus there: but mi&s;&s;ing him, he pur&s;ued his voyage to Macedonia, where on his arrival, he preached the go&s;pel in &s;everal places, even, as far as Illyricum, now called Sclavonia. During this journey, he met with many troubles and dangers, <HI>without were fightings,</HI> and <HI>within were fears:</HI> but God, who comforteth tho&s;e that are ca&s;t down, revived his &s;pirits by the arrival of Titus, who gave him a plea&s;ing account of the good effects his Epi&s;tle had produced at Corinth. This worthy bi&s;hop came thither with large contributions from that church, and from the example of tho&s;e liberal Chri&s;tians, St. Paul &s;tirred up the Macedonians to imitate their charity, intending to a&s;&s;i&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians at Jeru&s;alem, who were then in an indigent and per&s;ecuted &s;tate.</P>
<P>WHILE Titus continued in Macedonia, Paul wrote his &s;econd Epi&s;tle to Corinthians, and &s;ent it to them by Titus and Luke. In this, he endeavours to rectify what his for|mer Epi&s;tle had not effected, to vindicate his apo&s;tle&s;hip from that contempt and &s;corn, and him&s;elf from tho&s;e &s;landers and a&s;per&s;ions which the &s;educers, who found them&s;elves la&s;hed by his former letter, had ca&s;t upon him; together with &s;everal other particular ca&s;es relating to the church. About this time al&s;o, he wrote his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to Timothy, whom he had left at Ephe&s;us, wherein he gives him large directions how to carry him&s;elf in the di&s;charge of that great office and authority in the church, committed to his care; and in&s;tructs him in the particular qualifications of tho&s;e he &s;hould make choice of as bi&s;hops and mini&s;ters in the church. He likewi&s;e gives him in&s;tructions with regard to his giving orders to deacone&s;&s;es, and in&s;tructing &s;ervants; warning him at the &s;ame time again&s;t that pe&s;tilent generation of heretics and &s;educers that would ari&s;e in the church, after his departure.</P>
<P>WHILE Paul remained in Greece, he went to Corinth, where he wrote his excellent Epi&s;tle to the Romans, which he &s;ent by Phoebe, a deacone&s;s of the church of Cenchrea, near Corinth. His principle intention in this Epi&s;tle is, fully to &s;tate and determine the great controver&s;y between the Jews and Gentiles, with regard to the obligations of the rites and ceremonies of the Jewi&s;h law, and tho&s;e principal and material points of doc|trine depending upon it; namely, Chri&s;tian liberty, the u&s;e of indifferent things, and the like; and, which is the chief intention of all religion, in&s;tructs them, and pre&s;&s;es them to perform the duties of a holy and pious life, &s;uch as the Chri&s;tian doctrine natu|rally recommends and enforces.</P>
<P>BEING now determined to return into Syria, in order to convey the contributions to the brethren at Jeru&s;alem, he &s;et out on his journey; but being informed, that the Jews had formed a de&s;ign of killing and robbing him by the way, he returned back into Mace|donia, and came to Philippi, from whence he went to Troas, where he &s;tayed &s;even days: here he preached to them on the Lord's day, and continued his di&s;cour&s;e till midnight, be|ing him&s;elf to depart in the morning. The length of his di&s;cour&s;e and time of the night cau&s;ed &s;ome of his audience to be overtaken with &s;leep, and among&s;t them a young man, named Eutychus, who fell from the third &s;tory, and was taken up dead; but the apo&s;tle, by his prayer to the throne of grace, pre&s;ently re&s;tored him to life, and health.

<P>AFTER having fini&s;hed his di&s;cour&s;e, St. Paul kneeled down, and joined with them in prayer; when they all melted into tears, and, with the greate&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow, attended him to the &s;hip; grieving in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate manner for what he had tol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them, <HI>that they &s;hould &s;ee his face no more.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="029927_0342_0FE339A907357D50">DEPARTING from Myletus, Paul and his companions arrived at Coos, from whence they &s;ailed the next day to Rhodes, two i&s;lands in the Aegean &s;ea. From whence they came to Patra, the metropolis of Lycia, where they went on board another ve&s;&s;el bound for Tyre in Phoenicia. On his arrival he vi&s;ited the brethren there, and continued with them a week, and was advi&s;ed by &s;ome of them, who had the gift of prophecy, not to go up to Jeru&s;alem; but the apo&s;tle would by no means abandon his de&s;ign, or refu&s;e to &s;uffer any thing, provided he might &s;pread the go&s;pel of his Saviour. Finding all per&s;ua&s;ions were in vain, they all accompanied him to the &s;hore, where he kneeled down and prayed with them; and after embracing them with the utmo&s;t affection, he went on board, and came to Ptolemais, and the next day to Ce&s;area. Here Paul and his com|panions lodged in the hou&s;e of Philip, the Evangeli&s;t, one of the &s;even deacons &s;et apart by the apo&s;tles, and who had before converted the Samaritans. Philip had four daugh|ters, all virgins, each of whom had a prophetic &s;pirit.</P>
<P>WHILE they were in this place, Agabus, a Chri&s;tian prophet, came thither from Judea, who taking Paul's girdle, bound his own hands and feet with it; &s;ignifying by this ex|ternal &s;ymbol, that the Jews would bind Paul in that manner, and deliver him to the Gentiles. Whereupon, both his own companions and the Chri&s;tians of Ce&s;area, ear|ne&s;tly be&s;ought him, that he would not go up to Jeru&s;alem; but the apo&s;tle a&s;ked them, if they intended by the&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;&s;ua&s;ives to add more affliction to his &s;orrow? <HI>For I am ready,</HI> continued he, <HI>not only to be bound, but al&s;o to die at Jeru&s;alem, for the name of the Lord Je&s;us.</HI> When the di&s;ciples found that his re&s;olution was not to be &s;haken they importuned him no further, leaving the event to be determined according to the plea&s;ure of the Mo&s;t High. And all things being ready, Paul and his companions &s;et forwards on their journey, and were kindly and joyfully received by the Chri&s;tians at Jeru&s;alem, on their arrival.</P>
<P>PAUL and his companions, the next day after their arrival, went to the hou&s;e of St. James the apo&s;tle, where the re&s;t of the bi&s;hops and governors of the church were met together. After mutual &s;alutation, the apo&s;tle gave them a particular account of the &s;ucce&s;s with which God had ble&s;&s;ed his endeavours in propagating Chri&s;tianity among&s;t the Gentiles; for which they all joined in thank&s;giving to God; but withal told him, that he was now come to a place where there were many thou&s;ands of Jewi&s;h converts, who were all zealous for the law of Mo&s;es, and who had been informed, that he taught the Jews whom he had converted, to renounce circumci&s;ion, and the ceremo|nies of the law; that as &s;oon as the multitude heard of his arrival, they would all a&s;|&s;emble to &s;ee how he behaved him&s;elf in this matter: and therefore, to prevent di&s;turb|ance, they thought it advi&s;able for him to join him&s;elf with four per&s;ons, who were at that time to accompli&s;h a vow, and perform the u&s;ual rites and ceremonies with them, and provide &s;uch &s;acrifices for them, as the law, in that ca&s;e, required; and that as a &s;ymbol of their di&s;charging their vow, they might &s;have their heads; whereby it would appear, that the reports that were &s;pread concerning him, were fal&s;e and groundle&s;s, and that he him&s;elf &s;till ob&s;erved the rites and orders of the Mo&s;aical in&s;titutions. But, with regard to the Gentile converts, they required no &s;uch ob&s;ervances at their hands, nor expected any thing more from them in the&s;e indifferent matters, than what had been before determined in the &s;ynod formerly held at Jeru&s;alem. St. Paul, who in &s;uch ca&s;es was willing to become all things to all men, that he might gain the more, con|&s;ented to their coun&s;el; and, taking the per&s;ons with him to the temple, told the prie&s;ts that the time of a vow they had made being now expired, and having purified them&s;elves as the nature of their ca&s;e required, they were come to make the offerings which the law enjoined.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="029927_0343_0FE339AB51EC16C8">WHEN the &s;even days, which tho&s;e &s;acrifices were to be offered, were almo&s;t ended, certain Jews from A&s;ia, finding him in the temple, began to rai&s;e a tumult, and laying hold on Paul, called to their brethren the Jews to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, declaring that this was the per&s;on who every where preached doctrines detrimental to the Jewi&s;h nation, and de&s;tructive to the in&s;titutions of the law, and the purity of that &s;acred place which he had now defiled, by bringing Greeks into the temple: po&s;itively concluding, that be|cau&s;e they had &s;een Trophimus, a Gentile convert, with him in the city, that he had al&s;o brought him into the temple: &s;o apt is malice to make any &s;uppo&s;ition in order to draw from thence its own conclu&s;ion. This accu&s;ation, though ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, &s;et the whole city in an uproar, and &s;eizing on the apo&s;tle, they dragged him out of the temple, when the doors were immediately &s;hut, to prevent his returning into that holy place: nor had they failed of &s;oon putting a period to all his &s;ufferings and troubles, had n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Claudius Ly&s;ias, commander of the Roman garri&s;on, in the ca&s;tle of Antonio, arrived with a band of &s;oldiers to his re&s;cue, and &s;uppo&s;ing, from the great tumult of the Jews, that he was a more than ordinary malefactor, loaded him with a double chain, though he was as yet altogether ignorant, either of his country, or the crime he was accu&s;ed of; it being impo&s;&s;ible to obtain any &s;atisfactory an&s;wer from the multitude, who called for nothing but his death, following the &s;oldiers in &s;uch a riotous manner, that they were forced to carry the apo&s;tle in their arms, to &s;ecure him from the rage and violence of the people, who were ready to tear him in pieces.</P>
<P>WHILE they were going in this manner towards the ca&s;tle, Paul a&s;ked the governor whether he might have the liberty of &s;peaking to him; who, finding he under&s;tood the Greek language, inquired of him whether he was not an Egyptian, who, a few years before, had rai&s;ed a &s;edition in Judea, and headed a party of four thou&s;and vile and profligate wretches. To which the apo&s;tle replied, that he was a Jew of Tar&s;us, a free|man of a rich and honourable city, and therefore begged of him, that he might have leave to &s;peak unto the people. This the Roman officer readily granted, and Paul, &s;tanding near the door of the ca&s;tle, made &s;igns that they &s;hould hold their peace, and began to addre&s;s them in the Hebrew language; which engaged them to li&s;ten with more attention to the following extraordinary narrative.</P>
<P>"YE de&s;cendants of Jacob, li&s;ten to a per&s;on of your own religion, and, like your|&s;elves, a child of Abraham; born in Tar&s;us, and brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, and fully in&s;tructed in the law delivered by Mo&s;es to our forefathers, and formerly as zealous for the temple-wor&s;hip as ye are at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>"YEA, more, I per&s;ecuted unto death all who believed in JESUS, &s;eizing on all I could find both men and women, and ca&s;t them into pri&s;on. This the high-prie&s;t, and all our elders well know; for from them I received a commi&s;&s;ion, and repaired to Dama&s;cus, to bring from thence to Jeru&s;alem all the Chri&s;tians, in order to their undergoing an ex|emplary puni&s;hment. But as I was pur&s;uing my journey, to execute this commi&s;&s;ion, and being arrived near Dama&s;cus, there appeared, about mid-day, a light from heaven, &s;hining around me with great brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>"BEING terrified at &s;o awful an appearance I fell to the ground, and heard a voice &s;aying unto me, <HI>Saul, Saul why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me.</HI> To which I an&s;wered, <HI>Who art thou Lord?</HI> And the voice replied, <HI>I am Je&s;us of Nazareth, whom thou per&s;ecute&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>"MY companions, during this interval, were greatly terrified at the great light which &s;urrounded me; but they did not under&s;tand the words that were &s;poken from above.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="029927_0344_0FE339ACD7F58798">"AS &s;oon as I had recovered from the terror with which my mind was filled, on &s;eeing JESUS &s;o highly advanced above all earthly power, I an&s;wered, <HI>What &s;hall I do Lord?</HI> And he replied, <HI>Ari&s;e, and go into Dama&s;cus: and there it &s;hall be told thee of all things, which are appointed for thee to do.</HI></P>
<P>"I was immediately deprived of &s;ight by the brilliance of the glory that &s;hone around me; &s;o that my companions led me by the hand to Dama&s;cus, where one Ananias, a per|&s;on well re&s;pected by all the Jews of that city, vi&s;ited me, and &s;aid, <HI>Brother Saul, receive thy &s;ight.</HI> And in a moment my eyes were opened, and I &s;aw him &s;tanding before me.</P>
<P>"PERCEIVING that my &s;ight was re&s;tored he &s;aid to me,
<Q>The Almighty God of Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob, hath appointed thee to know his will, to &s;ee the great Me&s;|&s;iah the Holy One of God, and hear the voice of his mouth; for thou art cho&s;en to be a witne&s;s, to all the nations of the earth, of tho&s;e &s;urpri&s;ing things which thou ha&s;t &s;een and heard. Why therefore tarrie&s;t thou here any longer? <HI>Ari&s;e, and be baptized, and wa&s;h away thy &s;ins, calling on the name of the Lord.</HI></Q></P>
<P>"IN a &s;hort time after this glorious vi&s;ion, and miraculous power of the Mo&s;t High, when I was returned from Dama&s;cus to Jeru&s;alem, and offering up my prayers in the temple, I fell into a trance, and again &s;aw the great Son of David, who &s;aid unto me
<Q>Depart quickly from Jeru&s;alem; for the &s;ons of Jacob will refu&s;e to believe thy te&s;ti|mony concerning me.</Q>
And I an&s;wered,
<Q>Lord, they know how cruelly I u&s;ed thy &s;aints and followers; that I impri&s;oned and beat them in every city, and in every &s;yna|gogue. Nay, when they &s;hed the blood of thy holy martyr Stephen, I was al&s;o one of the &s;pectators; I con&s;ented to his death; I even kept the raiment of tho&s;e that &s;lew him.</Q>
But he replied,
<Q>Depart: I will &s;end thee to countries far remote; even to the Gentiles, that thou maye&s;t there &s;peak in my name and publi&s;h to them my &s;alvation.</Q></P>
<P>TILL now the Jews had li&s;tened with &s;ome attention to his &s;peech; but, on his men|tioning the commi&s;&s;ion he had received to preach the go&s;pel to the Gentiles, their fury knew no bounds; crying out, with one accord, <HI>Away with &s;uch a fellow from the earth:</HI> he is unworthy to be ranked among&s;t the race of mortals, or even to breathe the vital air. And as they thought words too weak to expre&s;s their fury, they threw off their clothes, and filled the air with du&s;t, indicating their great de&s;ire of &s;toning him to death.</P>
<P>AT this in&s;tant a captain of the guard commanded him to be brought within the ca&s;tle, and that he &s;hould be examined by &s;courging, till he confe&s;&s;ed the rea&s;on of the uncom|mon rage &s;hewn again&s;t him by the people. Accordingly, the lictor bound him, and was going to put the orders he had received into execution, when Paul a&s;ked the centu|rion that &s;tood by, whether it was lawful to &s;courge a citizen of Rome, before any &s;entence had been pa&s;&s;ed upon him? The centurion, in&s;tead of an&s;wering the que&s;tion, repaired immediately to the governor, de&s;iring him to take care how he proceeded again&s;t the pri&s;oner, becau&s;e he was a Roman.</P>
<P>ON this information, the governor him&s;elf came into the pri&s;on, and a&s;ked Paul, whether he was really a free citizen of Rome? And being told he was, he an&s;wered, that he him&s;elf procured the great privilege by a large &s;um of money; but Paul an&s;wered <HI>I was free born.</HI> On receiving this account, the governor commanded the centurion not to &s;courge him, being terrified at what he had already done; in chaining a free denizen of Rome. The next day therefore he ordered his chains to be taken off; and that he might thoroughly &s;atisfy him&s;elf of the cau&s;e of &s;o unu&s;ual a tumult the preceding day, &s;ummoned the Sanhedrim to meet, and brought down Paul before them, that they might hear his defence.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="029927_0345_0FE339AE5D509F98">BEING thus placed before the high council of the Jews, Paul told them, that in all the pa&s;&s;ages of his life, he had taken care to govern his actions by the &s;evere&s;t rules of duty and con&s;cience: <HI>Men and brethren I have lived in all good con&s;cience before God until this day.</HI> How great is the &s;ecurity of a truly good man? How &s;trong, though invi&s;ible, a &s;upport does innocence become in the greate&s;t danger! With how generous a confidence does virtue and hone&s;ty guard the brea&s;t of a true profe&s;&s;or of Chri&s;tianity! Nothing el&s;e in|deed can lay a &s;olid foundation for &s;atisfaction and tranquility. When any calamity over|takes us, religion and a good con&s;cience fill the brea&s;t with a heavenly &s;erenity, which all the little accidents of this world can neither ruffle or di&s;compo&s;e. And, accordingly, Seneca compares the mind of a wi&s;e and good man to the &s;tate of the upper region, which is always calm and &s;erene, though all around is tumult and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this expre&s;&s;ion of the apo&s;tle might tend to &s;hew the true &s;tate of his mind; the high-prie&s;t Ananias was &s;o offended at it, that he commanded tho&s;e who &s;tood next to him, to &s;trike him on the face; at which the apo&s;tle &s;martly replied, <HI>God &s;hall &s;mite thee, thou whited wall.</HI> Thou art placed on the &s;eat of judgment to determine according to the law, and commande&s;t me to be &s;mitten in direct oppo&s;ition to its precepts. On which &s;ome of the &s;pectators replied, it is not lawful to revile the high-prie&s;t of the Almighty. And Paul an&s;wered, I did not know that Ananias was appointed by God to be an high-prie&s;t; but as he is inve&s;ted with authority, it is unju&s;t to revile him, God him&s;elf having commanded, that <HI>no man &s;hould &s;peak evil of the ruler of the people.</HI> St. Paul, now perceiv|ing the council con&s;i&s;ted partly of Sadducees and partly of Phari&s;ees, cried aloud, "<HI>Men and brethren, I am a Phari&s;ee, a &s;on of a Phari&s;ee,</HI> and am now brought before this tribunal, for a&s;&s;erting the re&s;urrection from the dead." This declaration threw the whole court into confu&s;ion; the Phari&s;ees, being zealous patrons of that tenet, declared the pri&s;oner innocent, and that in all probability he had received &s;ome intimation from heaven by an an|gel, or the &s;ilent whi&s;pers of the Holy Spirit; and if &s;o, they really fought again&s;t the Omnipotence him&s;elf, by oppo&s;ing his doctrine. While the Sadducees, who denied the re&s;urrection, together with the exi&s;tence of either angel or &s;pirit, &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted that the apo&s;tle was a turbulent per&s;on, and ought to be puni&s;hed for his mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>HEREUPON the council was greatly divided, and their di&s;&s;entions increa&s;ed to that degree, that the captain feared Paul would have been pulled in pieces by them, and therefore took him from the bar, and carried him back to the ca&s;tle. But during the &s;ilence of the night, the great Redeemer of mankind, to comfort his faithful &s;ervant under all the terrors he had &s;uffered the two preceding days, appeared to him in a vi&s;ion, encouraging him to con&s;tancy and re&s;olution, a&s;&s;uring him, that as he had borne witne&s;s of him at Je|ru&s;alem, he &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding all the malice and wicked de&s;igns of his enemies, live to bear his te&s;timony even in Rome it&s;elf before the Gentiles.</P>
<P>THE Jews, who&s;e envy and malice were increa&s;ed by the dilatory proceedings, deter|mined, the next morning, to u&s;e a quicker method of putting a period to his life. In order to this, above forty of the mo&s;t turbulent entered into a &s;hocking confederacy of killing him; ratifying it by an oath, and the mo&s;t bitter execration, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had put their inhuman de&s;ign in execution: but &s;uch vile mon&s;ters would do well to remember, that a Being, from who&s;e eye nothing can be con|cealed, and who&s;e power nothing can re&s;i&s;t, is privy to all their actions, often renders their de&s;igns abortive, and will &s;urely puni&s;h them for their ba&s;e attempts. Accordingly, this de&s;ign, though probably concluded under the pitchy mantle of the night, was di&s;covered to St. Paul, by his &s;i&s;ter's &s;on, and, at the reque&s;t of the apo&s;tle, told to the governor him&s;elf, who immediately commanded two parties of hor&s;e and foot to be ready
<PB N="325" REF="029927_0346_0FE339B847D5E7B8">
by nine o'clock that night, in order to conduct St. Paul to Felix, the Roman governor of that province, to whom al&s;o he &s;ent an account of the whole proceedings of the Jews again&s;t the pri&s;oner; and, at the &s;ame time, ordered his accu&s;ers al&s;o to appear be|fore the Roman magi&s;trate: accordingly St. Paul was conducted to Antipatris, and afterwards to Ce&s;area, where the letters being delivered to Felix, the apo&s;tle was al&s;o pre&s;ented to him; and finding that he belonged to the province of Cilicia, he told him, that as &s;oon as his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cu&s;ers were come down, he would determine the affair, and commanded him to be &s;ecured in the place called Herod's Hall, till they &s;hould appear again&s;t him.</P>
<P>ANANIAS the high-prie&s;t, with &s;ome others of the Sanhedrim, came to Ce&s;area, a few days after St. Paul's arrival, accompanied by Tertullus their advocate, who, in a &s;hort, but eloquent &s;peech, adorned with all the flattering and in&s;inuating arts of oratory, began to accu&s;e the apo&s;tle, charging him with &s;edition, here&s;y, and the profanation of the temple; that they would have &s;aved him the trouble of this hearing, by judging him according to their own law, had not Ly&s;ias, the chief captain, violently taken him from them, and &s;ent both the pri&s;oner and them to Ce&s;area, by a guard of &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>THE charge of the orator again&s;t the apo&s;tle being fini&s;hed, Felix told St. Paul, that he was now at liberty to make his defence: accordingly he di&s;tinctly an&s;wered every part of the charge, in the following manner. "I an&s;wer this charge of the Jews with greater &s;atisfaction before thee, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t for many years been a judge of this nation. About twelve days &s;ince, I repaired to Jeru&s;alem, to wor&s;hip the God of Jacob: but I neither di&s;puted with any man, or endeavoured to &s;tir up the people in the &s;yna|gogues or the city; nor can they prove the charge they have brought again&s;t me at this time.</P>
<P>"HOWEVER, I readily confe&s;s, <HI>that after the way which they call here&s;y, &s;o wor&s;hip I the God of my fathers,</HI> firmly believing every part of the writings of Mo&s;es and the prophets; and, at the &s;ame time, believe as they them&s;elves al&s;o do, that the Almighty will rai&s;e at the la&s;t day, both the ju&s;t and unju&s;t from the dead; and I am careful to maintain a clear and quiet con&s;cience, both towards God and man, agreeable to this faith&punc;</P>
<P>"HAVING &s;pent &s;ome years in di&s;tant countries, I repaired to Jeru&s;alem, with the alm&punc; I had collected in other provinces, for the poor of mine own nation, and offerings for the God of Jacob. And while I was performing the duties of religion, certain A&s;iatic Jews found me in the temple, purified according to the law; but neither attended with a multitude of followers, or the lea&s;t tumultuous a&s;&s;embly. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary that the&s;e Jews &s;hould have been here, if they had any thing to alledge again&s;t me: nay, I appeal to tho&s;e of the Sanhedrim here pre&s;ent, if any thing has been laid to my charge, except the objections of the Sadducees, who violently oppo&s;ed me for a&s;&s;erting the doc|trine of the re&s;urrection from the grave at the la&s;t day."</P>
<P>HAVING thus heard both parties, Felix refu&s;ed to pa&s;s any final &s;entence, till he had more fully advi&s;ed about it, and con&s;ulted Ly&s;ias the governor of the ca&s;tle, who was the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to give an account of the &s;edition and tumult; commanding, in the mean time, that St. Paul &s;hould be kept under a guard, but at the &s;ame time enjoy the liberty of being vi&s;ited by his friends, and receive from them any office of friend&s;hip and kindne&s;s they thought proper to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>DRUSILLA, a Jewe&s;s, and daughter of the elder Herod, who was al&s;o the wife of Felix, &s;oon after this came down to him at Ce&s;area, in who&s;e pre&s;ence the governor &s;ent

In this di&s;cour&s;e, the apo&s;tle took occa&s;ion particularly to in&s;i&s;t upon the great obligation which the laws of CHRIST lay upon men to judgment and righteou&s;ne&s;s, to &s;obriety and cha&s;tity; urging, at the &s;ame time, the true and impartial account that mu&s;t be given at the judg|ment of the great day, when all men &s;hall be arraigned before the awful tribunal of Omnipotence, for the actions of their pa&s;t lives, and be eternally puni&s;hed or rewarded, according to their works done in the body.</P>
<P>THIS rea&s;oning was wi&s;ely adopted to the &s;tate and temper of Felix; but corro&s;ives are very unea&s;y to a guilty mind: men naturally hate whatever brings their &s;ins to rem|mebrance, and &s;harpens the &s;ting of a violated con&s;cience. But however di&s;agreeable the&s;e truths may be, they cannot be heard without confu&s;ion; and, accordingly, when St. Paul pathetically de&s;cribed the terrors of the la&s;t judgment, Felix trembled on his throne; and was &s;o greatly affected, that he cau&s;ed the apo&s;tle to break off abruptly, telling him that he would hear the remainder of his di&s;cour&s;e at a &s;ea&s;on more convenient than the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY Felix had &s;ufficient rea&s;on to tremble, and his con&s;cience to be &s;en&s;ibly alarmed at the&s;e reflections; for he was a man notoriou&s;ly infamous for rapine and vio|lence. Tacitus tells us, that he made his will the law of the government, practi&s;ing all manner of cruelty and inju&s;tice: his incontinence, luxury, and debauchery, was remarka|ble; nor did he &s;cruple to violate all the laws of God and man, to &s;atisfy his unruly pa&s;|&s;ions: to the&s;e qualities he added bribery and covetou&s;ne&s;s; and, therefore, often &s;ent for our apo&s;tle to di&s;cour&s;e with him, expecting he would have given him a con&s;iderable &s;um for his relea&s;e; having in all probability, heard that St. Paul had brought a large quantity of money to Jeru&s;alem: but finding no offers were made him, either by the apo&s;tle him&s;elf or his friends, he kept him pri&s;oner two years; when he him&s;elf being di&s;charged from his office by Nero, he left Paul in pri&s;on, in order to gratify the malice of the Jews, and engage them, after his departure from Judea, to &s;peak the better of his government.</P>
<P>AFTER the di&s;placing of Felix, the government of the province was conferred on Por|tius Fe&s;tus, before whom, at his fir&s;t coming to Jeru&s;alem, the high-prie&s;t and Sanhedrim preferred an indictment again&s;t Paul, de&s;iring that he might be &s;ent for up to Jeru&s;alem, in order to his trial, intending to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him by the way: but Fe&s;tus told them, that he was &s;hortly going him&s;elf to Ce&s;area; and that, if they had any complaint again&s;t Paul, they might come down thither and accu&s;e him. Accordingly, as &s;oon as he was come to Ce&s;area, he a&s;cended the tribunal, where the Jews renewed the charge they had before brought again&s;t Paul; but the apo&s;tle &s;oon cleared him&s;elf of every part of the charge, they not being able to prove any thing again&s;t him. Fe&s;tus, however, being willing to procure the favour of the Jews at his entrance on the government, a&s;ked him whether he would go up and be tried before him at Jeru&s;alem? But the apo&s;tle well knowing the con|&s;equences of &s;uch a propo&s;al, an&s;wered, "I am a Roman, and therefore ought to be judged by the Roman law; and now &s;tand before the judgment-&s;eat of Cae&s;ar. I have done nothing again&s;t the Jews, a fact thou thy&s;elf very well knowe&s;t to be true. If I have committed any thing that de&s;erves death, I am ready to die; but if not, no per&s;on hath a power to deliver me into the hands of mine enemies. <HI>I appeal unto Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>APPEALS of this nature were common among&s;t the Romans, and introduced to de|fend and &s;ecure the lives and fortunes of the people from the unju&s;t encroachment and and over-rigorous &s;everities of the magi&s;trates, whereby it was lawful in ca&s;es of oppre&s;|&s;ion

to appeal to the emperor for redre&s;s; a thing more than once &s;etteled by the function of the Valerian law, and now fully e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>KING Agrippa, who &s;ucceeded Herod in the tetrarchate of Galilee, and his &s;i&s;ter Bernice, came to Ce&s;area, &s;ome time after St. Paul had appealed to Cae&s;ar, to vi&s;it the new governor. Fe&s;tus embraced this opportunity of mentioning the ca&s;e of our apo&s;|tle to king Agrippa, together with the remarkable tumult this affair had occa&s;ioned among&s;t the Jews and the appeal he had made to Cae&s;ar. This account excited the the curio&s;ity of king Agrippa, and he was de&s;irous of hearing him&s;elf what St. Paul had to &s;ay in his own vindication. Accordingly the next day the king and his &s;i&s;ter, ac|companied with Fe&s;tus the governor, and &s;everal other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, came into the court with a pompous and &s;plendid retinue, where the pri&s;oner was brought before them. On his appearing, Fe&s;tus informed the court how greatly he had been impor|tuned by the Jews, both at Ce&s;area and Jeru&s;alem, to put the pri&s;oner to death as a malefactor; but having, on examination, found him guilty of no capital crime, and the pri&s;oner him&s;elf having appealed unto Cae&s;ar, he was determined to &s;end him to Rome; but was willing to have his cau&s;e debated before Agrippa, that he might be furni&s;hed with &s;ome material particulars to &s;end with him; it being highly ab&s;urd to &s;end thither a pri&s;oner without &s;ignifying the crimes laid to his charge.</P>
<P>AFTER Fe&s;tus had fini&s;hed his &s;peech, Agrippa told Paul, he was now at liberty to make his own defence: and &s;ilence being made, he addre&s;&s;ed his &s;peech particularly to Agrippa, in the following manner.</P>
<P>"I e&s;teem it a particular happine&s;s, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defence again&s;t the accu&s;ations of the Jews, before thee; becau&s;e thou art well accquainted with all their cu&s;toms, and the que&s;tions commonly debated among&s;t them: I therefore be|&s;eech thee to hear me patiently and impartially.</P>
<P>"THE Jews in general are well acquainted with my manner of life from my youth, the greate&s;t part of it having been &s;pent with mine own countrymen at Jeru&s;alem, They al&s;o know that I was educated under the in&s;titutions of the Phari&s;ees, the &s;trict|e&s;t &s;ect of our religion, and am now arrainged for a tenet believed by all their fathers, a tenet &s;ufficiently credible in it&s;elf, and plainly revealed in the Scripture, I mean, the re&s;urrection of the dead. Why &s;hould any mortal think it either incredible or impo&s;|&s;ible, that God &s;hould rai&s;e the dead to life?</P>
<P>"I once though my&s;elf indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to oppo&s;e the religion of JESUS of Na|zareth: nor was I &s;atisfied with impri&s;oning, and puni&s;hing with death it&s;elf, the &s;aints I found at Jeru&s;alem; I even per&s;ecuted them in &s;trange cities, whither my implacable zeal per&s;ued them having procured authority from the chief prie&s;ts and elders for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>"I departed accordingly for Dama&s;cus with a commi&s;&s;ion from the Sanhedrim; but as I was travelling towards that city, I &s;aw at mid-day, O king, a light from heaven, far exceeding the brightne&s;s of the &s;un, encompa&s;&s;ing me and my companions. On &s;eeing this awful appearance, we all fell to the earth; and I heard a voice, which &s;aid to me in the Hebrew language, <HI>Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me? It is hard for the to kick again&s;t the pricks?</HI> To which I an&s;wered, <HI>Who art thou, Lord?</HI> And he replied, <HI>I am Je&s;us, whom thou per&s;ecute&s;t:</HI> but be not terrified, ari&s;e from the earth; for I have appeared unto thee, that thou mighte&s;t be both witne&s;s of the things thou ha&s;t &s;een, and al&s;o of others which I will hereafter reveal unto thee: my power &s;hall deliver thee from

the Jews and the Gentiles, to whom now I &s;end thee to preach the go&s;pel; to withdraw the veil of darkne&s;s and ignorance, to turn them from fal&s;ehood unto truth, <HI>and from the power of &s;atan unto God.</HI></P>
<P>"HEREUPON, king Agrippa, I readily obeyed the heavenly vi&s;ion; I preached the go&s;pel fir&s;t to the inhabitants of Dama&s;cus, then to tho&s;e of Jeru&s;alem and Judea, and afterwards to the Gentiles; per&s;uading them to for&s;ake their iniquities, and turn to the living God, by &s;incere repentance.</P>
<P>"THE Jews, being exa&s;perated at the&s;e endeavours to &s;ave the &s;ouls of &s;inful mortals, caught me in the temple, and entered into a con&s;piracy to de&s;troy me; but by the help of Omnipotence, I &s;till remain a witne&s;s to all the human race, preaching nothing but what Mo&s;es and all the prophets foretold, namely, that the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould &s;uffer, be the fir&s;t that &s;hould ri&s;e from the chambers of the grave, and publi&s;h, both to the Jews and Gentiles, the glad-tidings of &s;alvation."</P>
<P>AFTER the apo&s;tle had thus pleaded for him&s;elf Fe&s;tus cried out, "Paul, thou art mad; too much &s;tudy hath deprived thee of thy rea&s;on." But Paul an&s;wered, "I am far, mo&s;t noble Fe&s;tus, from being tran&s;ported with idle and di&s;tracted ideas; the words I &s;peak are dictated by truth and &s;obriety: and I am per&s;uaded that king Agrippa him&s;elf is not ignorant of the&s;e things: for they were tran&s;acted openly before the world. I am confident, king Agrippa, that thou believe&s;t the prophets; and there|fore, mu&s;t know that all their predictions were fulfilled in CHRIST." To which Agrippa an&s;wered, "Thou ha&s;t almo&s;t per&s;uaded me to embrace the Chri&s;tian faith." And Paul, replied, "I &s;incerely wi&s;h, that not only thou, but al&s;o all that hear me, were not almo&s;t, but altogether the &s;ame as I my&s;elf, except being pri&s;oners."</P>
<P>AFTER Paul had thus &s;poken, the king and the governor, with the re&s;t of the council, withdrew to confer privately together; and finding, by the accu&s;ations brought again&s;t him, that he was not guilty by the Roman law of any capital offence, nor even of &s;uch as de&s;erved impri&s;onment, Agrippa told Fe&s;tus, that he might have been &s;et at liberty if he had not appealed unto Cae&s;ar; but an appeal being once made, the judge had no longer any power either to ab&s;olve or condemn, the cau&s;e being entirely re&s;erved to the cognizance of that &s;uperior, to whom the pri&s;oner had appealed, for his own ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>AS it was now finally determined Paul &s;hould be &s;ent to Rome, he, with &s;everal others, pri&s;oners of con&s;equence, were committed to the care of Julius, commander of a company belonging to the legion of Augu&s;tus; and was accompanied in this voyage by St. Luke, Ari&s;tarchus, Trophimus, and &s;ome others not mentioned by the &s;acred penman.</P>
<P>IN the month of September 56, or according to others, 57, they embarked on board a &s;hip of Adramyttium, and &s;ailed to Sidon, where the centurion courteou&s;ly gave the apo&s;tle leave to go on &s;hore to vi&s;it his friends, and refre&s;h him&s;elf. After a &s;hort &s;tay they &s;ailed for Cyprus, and arrived oppo&s;ite the Fair Havens, a place near Myra, a city of Lycia. Here the &s;ea&s;on being far advanced, and Paul fore&s;eeing it would be a dange|rous voyage, per&s;uaded them to put in and winter there; but the Roman centurion pre|ferring the opinion of the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, and the harbour being at the &s;ame time incommodious, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to reach Phoenice, a port of Crete, and winter there. But they &s;oon found them&s;elves di&s;appointed; for the fine &s;outherly gale, which had fa|voured them for &s;ome time, &s;uddenly changed into a &s;tormy and tempe&s;tuous wind at north-ea&s;t, which blew with &s;uch violence that the &s;hip was obliged to &s;ail before it; and to prevent her foundering, they threw overboard the principal part of her lading, to lighten the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="029927_0350_0FE339C4E69E13F0">THEY continued fourteen days in this de&s;perate and uncomfortable condition, neither &s;un nor &s;tar appearing for great part of the time. During this confu&s;ion, the apo&s;tle put them in mind how prepo&s;terou&s;ly they had acted in not li&s;tening to his advice; but, at the &s;ame time told them, that the God whom he &s;erved and wor&s;hipped, had the la&s;t night &s;ent an angel to him, with a&s;&s;urance that, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent danger, not one of their lives &s;hould be lo&s;t, though the &s;hip &s;hould be wrecked.</P>
<P>WHEN the fourteenth night arrived, the &s;ailors, upon &s;ounding, found they were near &s;ome coa&s;t; and, therefore, to avoid the rocks, thought proper to come to an anchor, till the morning might give them better information. In the mean time, the &s;eamen, how be&s;t under&s;tood the danger, were preparing to get into the boat to &s;ave them&s;elves; which Paul perceiving, told the captain, that unle&s;s they all &s;tayed in the &s;hip, not one of them could be &s;aved: whereupon the &s;oldiers cut the ropes, and let the boat fall into the &s;ea, from the &s;hip.</P>
<P>WHILE they continued at anchor, waiting for the light of the morning, St. Paul pre|vailed upon them to eat, and refre&s;h them&s;elves, having fa&s;ted a long time, a&s;&s;uring them they &s;hould all e&s;cape. When they had fini&s;hed their repa&s;t, they lightened the &s;hip of tho&s;e goods which &s;till remained on board, and endeavoured to put into a &s;mall creek they had di&s;covered at a little di&s;tance; but falling into a place where two &s;eas met, the &s;hip ran aground, the forepart remaining immovable, but the after part was demoli&s;hed by the waves: awakened with the danger they were in, the &s;oldiers were de&s;irous of killing the pri&s;oners, le&s;t any of them &s;hould make their e&s;cape: but the centurion, wil|ling to &s;ave Paul, refu&s;ed his con&s;ent, commanding that every one &s;hould &s;hift for him|&s;elf in the be&s;t method he could. Accordingly, &s;ome by &s;wimming, and others by broken pieces of the &s;hip, they all, to the number of two hundred three&s;core and &s;ixteen, got to &s;hore in &s;afety.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to St. Paul's prediction, the country on which they were ca&s;t, was an i&s;land called Melita, now Malta, &s;ituated in the Lybian &s;ea, between Syracu&s;e and Africa. Here they met with great civility from a barbarous people, and the plain acknowledg|ments of a divine ju&s;tice written on the naked and unin&s;tructed minds of men; they treated them with great humanity, entertaining them with all the nece&s;&s;ary accomoda|tions: but while St. Paul was laying a few &s;ticks on the fire, a viper enlivened by the heat, came from among&s;t the wood and fa&s;tened on his hand. On &s;eeing this, the inha|bitants of the i&s;land concluded, that he was certainly &s;ome notorious murderer, whom the divine vengeance, though it &s;uffered him to e&s;cape the &s;ea, had re&s;erved for a more public and &s;olemn execution: but when they &s;aw him &s;hake off the venemous creature into the fire, and no manner of harm en&s;ue, they changed their &s;entiments, and cried out, <HI>that he was a God:</HI> &s;o ea&s;ily are light and credulous minds tran&s;ported from one ex|treme to another, according to the difference of occurrences.</P>
<P>THE re&s;idence of Publius, the governor of the i&s;land, was not far from the place where they were &s;hipwrecked: he entertained this unfortunate company with great ho&s;pitality for three days; in acknowledgment of which St. Paul by his prayers, and the impo&s;ition of his hands, recovered his father from a fever and bloody-flux; and re&s;tored &s;everal others of the inhabitants, afflicted with different di&s;ea&s;es, to their former health and &s;trength; in con&s;equence of which, they not only &s;hewed him the greate&s;t marks of their e&s;teem, but furni&s;hed both him and his company with all the nece&s;&s;aries proper for the re&s;t of their voyage.</P>
<P>AFTER three months &s;tay in this i&s;land, the centurion with his charge went on board the Ca&s;tor and Pollux, a &s;hip of Alexandria, bound to Italy. They put in at Syracu&s;e,
<PB N="330" REF="029927_0351_0FE339C744DFAE40">
where they tarried three days, &s;ailed from thence to Regium, and &s;o to Puteoli, where they landed; and finding &s;ome Chri&s;tians there, &s;taid at their reque&s;t a week with them, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;et forward on their journey to Rome. The Chri&s;tians of this city, hearing of the apo&s;tle's coming, went to meet him as far as the Three Taverns, about thirty miles from Rome, and others as far as the Apii Forum, fifty-one miles di&s;tant from the capital: they kindly embraced each other, and the liberty he &s;aw the Chri&s;tians enjoy at Rome, great|ly tended to enliven the &s;pirits of the apo&s;tle. By the&s;e Chri&s;tians he was conducted in a kind of triumph into the city, where, at their arrival, the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners were delivered to the captain of the guard, and by him di&s;po&s;ed in the common pri&s;on; but St. Paul, probably by the interce&s;&s;ion of Julius, was permitted to re&s;ide in a private hou&s;e, with only one &s;oldier to guard him.</P>
<P>ST. PAUL arriving at Rome, he &s;ent, after he had been there three days, for the heads of the Jewi&s;h con&s;i&s;tory in that city, and related to them the cau&s;e of his coming, in the following manner: "Though I have been guilty of no violence of the laws of our religion, yet I was delivered by the Jews at Jeru&s;alem to the Roman governors, who more than once would have acquitted me as innocent of any capital offence; but by the per|ver&s;ene&s;s of my per&s;ecutors, I was obliged to appeal unto Cae&s;ar; not that I had any thing to accu&s;e my nation of: I had therefore recour&s;e to this method, merely to prove mine own innocence, and confute the allegations of my enemies."</P>
<P>A popular prejudice being thus removed he added, "That the true cau&s;e of his &s;uffer|ings was what their own religion had taught him, the belief and expectation of a future re&s;urrection." This &s;peech gained greatly on their affections, and they an&s;wered, That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y had received no advice concerning him, nor had any of the Jews that came from Judea brought any charge again&s;t him; but, at the &s;ame time, they de&s;ired to know what he had to &s;ay in &s;upport of the religion he embraced, it being every where decried both by Jew and Gentile. Accordingly, upon a day appointed, he di&s;cour&s;ed with them from morning to night concerning the religion and doctrine of the holy JESUS; proving, from the promi&s;es and predictions of the Old Te&s;tament, that he was the true Me&s;&s;iah; but his di&s;cour&s;e had different effects on different hearers, &s;ome be|ing convinced, and others per&s;i&s;ting in their infidelity; and as they were departing in &s;ome di&s;content at each other, the apo&s;tle told them, it was too plain that God had accompli&s;hed upon them the prophetical cur&s;e, of being left to their own wilful hardi|ne&s;s and impenitency to be blind at noon-day, and to run them&s;elves headlong into irrecoverable ruin. That &s;ince this was the ca&s;e, they mu&s;t expect, that he would henceforth preach to the Gentiles, who would very readily embrace the glad-tidings of the go&s;pel, which they &s;o &s;cornfully rejected.</P>
<P>DURING two whole years, Paul dwelt at Rome, in a hou&s;e he had hired for his own u&s;e; wherein he con&s;tantly employed him&s;elf in preaching and writing for the good of the church. He preached daily without interruption, and with rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">kable &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o that his impri&s;onment contributed greatly to the propagation of the go&s;pel, and ren|dered him famous even in the emperor's court, where he converted &s;everal to the faith of CHRIST.</P>
<P>BESIDES others of the apo&s;tle's converts at Rome, there was one One&s;imus, who had formerly been a &s;ervant to Philemon, a per&s;on of di&s;tinction in Colo&s;&s;e, but had run away from his ma&s;ter, and taken with him &s;ome things of value. Having rambled as far as Rome, he was now converted by St. Paul, and by him returned to his ma&s;ter, with a &s;hort recommendatory letter, earne&s;tly de&s;iring him to pardon him; and, notwith&s;tand|ing his former faults, to treat him kindly, and u&s;e him as a brother, promi&s;ing withal, that if he had wronged or owed him any thing, he him&s;elf would repay it for him.</P>

<P>THE apo&s;tle had lived three years at Ephe&s;us, preaching the go&s;pel to the numerous inhabitants of that city, and was therefore well acquainted with the &s;tate and condition of the place; &s;o that taking the opportunity of Tychicus's going thither he wrote his Epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians, wherein he endeavours to countermine the principles and practices both of the Jews and Gentiles; to confirm them in the belief and practice of the Chri&s;tian doc|trine; and to in&s;truct them fully in the great my&s;teries of the go&s;pel; that redemption and ju&s;tification by the death of CHRIST; their gratuitous election; their union with the Jews in the body, of which CHRIST is the head, and the glorious exaltation of that head above all creatures both &s;piritual and temporal; together with many excellent moral pre|cepts, both as to the general duties of religion, and the duties of their particular relations in life.</P>
<P>THOUGH St. Paul, him&s;elf had never been at Colo&s;&s;e, yet Epaphras, who was then at Rome a pri&s;oner with him, had preached the go&s;pel there with good &s;ucce&s;s; and from him might learn, that certain fal&s;e teachers had endeavoured to per&s;uade the people, that they ought not to apply to God by JESUS CHRIST, who, &s;ince his a&s;cen&s;ion, was &s;o far ex|alted above them, that angels were now become the proper mediators between God and man; and, therefore, in oppo&s;ition to this, as well as other &s;eductions of the &s;ame nature, he wrote his Epi&s;tle to the Collo&s;&s;ians; wherein he magnificently di&s;plays the Me&s;&s;iah, and all the benefits flowing from him, as being the image of his Father, the Redeemer of all mankind, the reconciler of all things to God, and the head of the church, which gives life and vigour to all its members: he commends the doctrine preached to them by Epaphras, and exhorts them not to be led away by the rea&s;onings of human phi|lo&s;ophy, by the &s;uper&s;titious practices of making differences of meats and drinks, or by a pretended humility in wor&s;hipping angels; and gives them an ab&s;tract of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny

principal duties of the Chri&s;tian life, e&s;pecially &s;uch as re&s;pect the relations between hu&s;bands and wives, parents and children, ma&s;ters and &s;ervants, and other &s;ocial and relative duties.</P>
<P>WE have no account in hi&s;tory, by what means St. Paul was delivered from his im|pri&s;onment, and di&s;charged from the accu&s;ation the Jews brought again&s;t him; but it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that not having &s;ufficient proof of what they alledged, or being in|formed that the crimes they accu&s;ed him of, were no violations of the Roman law, they dur&s;t not implead him before the emperor, and &s;o permitted him to be di&s;charged of cour&s;e: but by whatever means he procured his liberty, he wrote his Epi&s;tle to the He|brews before he left Italy, from whence he dates his &s;alutations to the Jewi&s;h churches.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the principal de&s;ign of this admirable Epi&s;tle is, to magnify CHRIST and the religion of the go&s;pel, above Mo&s;es and the Jewi&s;h econo|my, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h and confirm the converted Jews in the firm belief and pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, notwith&s;tanding the trouble and per&s;ecutions that would cer|tainly attend them. He therefore repre&s;ents our Saviour in his divine nature, as far &s;uperior to all angels, and all created being; and in his mediatorial capacity as a greater prie&s;t than Aaron, and a greater king and prie&s;t than Melchi&s;edec: he &s;hews that the ceremonies, the &s;acrifices, and the ob&s;ervances of the law could have no vir|tue in them&s;elves, but only as they were the types of JESUS CHRIST; and being now accompli&s;hed in his per&s;on, were finally and totally aboli&s;hed: he in&s;i&s;ts on the nece&s;|&s;ity of faith; and by the examples of the patriarchs, and prophets, proves that ju&s;tification can be procured no other way, than by the merits of a dying Saviour: and, la&s;tly, he min|gles many excellent precepts for the regulation of their lives; exhortations to put tru&s;t and confidence in CHRIST, in all their &s;ufferings; and &s;trict cautions again&s;t apo&s;tacy from his religion in the hotte&s;t per&s;ecutions from their enemies.</P>
<P>ST. PAUL, having thus di&s;charged his mini&s;try, both by preaching and writing in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">aly, pro&s;ecuted his long intended journey into Spain, accompanied by Timothy; and, according to the te&s;timony of &s;everal writers, cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea, and preached the go&s;pel in Britain. What &s;ucce&s;s he had in the&s;e we&s;tern parts, is not known; he how|ever continued there eight or nine months, and then returned again to the Ea&s;t, vi&s;ited Sicily, Greece, and Crete, and then repaired into Judea.</P>
<P>HOW long he continued in his native country, is unknown, no further mention being made of him, till his return to Rome, which was probably about the eighth or ninth year of Nero's reign. Here he met with Peter, and was, together with him, thrown into pri&s;on, doubtle&s;s in the general pro&s;ecution rai&s;ed again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, under pretence that they had &s;et fire to the city: but be&s;ides this general, there were particular rea&s;ons for his impri&s;onment. Some of the ancients &s;ay, he was engaged with St. Peter in detecting the impo&s;itions of Simon Magus.</P>
<P>ST. CHRYSOSTOM tells us, that Nero was highly enraged again&s;t St. Paul, for his hav|ing converted one of his favourite concubines; and the apo&s;tle, after he was thrown into pri&s;on, per&s;i&s;ting to per&s;uade that lady to continue in her cha&s;te and pious re&s;olu|tions, Nero commanded him to be put to death. How long he continued in pri&s;on, is uncertain; nor do we know whether he was &s;courged before his execution: he was however allowed the privilege of a Roman citizen, and therefore beheaded.</P>
<P>AS he was led to the place of execution, he is &s;aid to have converted three of the &s;oldiers &s;ent to guard and conduct him, and who &s;oon after became martyrs to the faith.

Being come to the place, which was the Aquae Salviae, three miles from Rome, he cheerfully, after a &s;olemn preparation, gave his neck to the fatal &s;troke; and from this vale of mi&s;ery, his &s;pirit pa&s;&s;ed to the bli&s;sful regions of immortality to the kingdom of his beloved Ma&s;ter, the great redeemer of the human race, in the propagation of who&s;e go&s;pel, he had &s;o long and faithfully laboured.</P>
<P>HIS mortal part was buried in the Via O&s;tien&s;is, about two miles from Rome; and about the year 317, Con&s;tantine the Great, at the in&s;tance of Pope Sylve&s;ter, built a &s;tately church over his grave, adorned it with an hundred marble columns and beauti|fied it with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip: but this church being thought too &s;mall for the honour of &s;o great an apo&s;tle, Valentinian, by a re&s;cript to Sau&s;tius, perfect of the city, cau&s;ed it to be taken down, and a much larger &s;tructure to be erected, which was fini&s;hed after his death by Theodo&s;ius; and further beautified, at the per&s;ua&s;ion of Leo, bi&s;hop of Rome, by the empre&s;s Placida.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to Nicephorus, St. Paul was of a low and &s;mall &s;tature, &s;omewhat &s;toop|ing; his complexion was fair, his countenance grave, his head &s;mall, his eyes &s;parkling, his no&s;e high and bending, and his hair thick and dark, but mixed with grey. His con&s;titution was weak, and often &s;ubject to di&s;tempers: but how mean &s;oever the ca|binet might be, there was a trea&s;ure within precious and valuable, as will &s;ufficiently appear, if we view the accompli&s;hments of his mind.</P>
<P>HIS judgment was clear and &s;olid, his under&s;tanding quick and his memory was &s;trong and clear; all which were greatly improved by art, and the advantages of a liberal edu|cation. The &s;chools of Tar&s;us and Jeru&s;alem had &s;harpened his di&s;cur&s;ive faculty by logic and the arts of rea&s;oning, in&s;tructed him in the in&s;titutions of philo&s;ophy, and adorned his mind with every kind of human learning. A &s;ufficient proof, that it is not unlawful to bring the &s;poils of Egypt into the &s;ervice of the &s;anctuary; and to make u&s;e of the advantages of foreign &s;tudies and human literature to divine and excellent pur|po&s;es. He &s;eems indeed to have been educated purpo&s;ely to qualify him for being the apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, to contend with and confute the grave and the wi&s;e, the acute and the &s;ubtle, the &s;age and the learned of the heathen world, and to wound them with arrows from their own quivers. He &s;eldom made u&s;e of learning and philo&s;ophy; it being more agreeable to the de&s;igns of the go&s;pel, to confound, by the plain doctrine of the cro&s;s, the wi&s;dom and learning of the world.</P>
<P>THOUGH the&s;e were great accompli&s;hments, yet they were only a &s;hadow of that divine temper of mind he enjoyed, and which di&s;covered it&s;elf through the whole cour&s;e of his life. He was humble to the lowe&s;t &s;tep of aba&s;ement and conde&s;cen&s;ion, none ever think|ing better of others, or more meanly of him&s;elf. And though when he had to deal with envious and malicious adver&s;aries, who endeavoured, by vilifying his per&s;on, to ob&s;truct his mini&s;try, he knew how to magnify his office, and to let them know that he was not inferior to the chiefe&s;t of the apo&s;tles; yet, at other times, he always declared to the world, that he con&s;idered him&s;elf as an abortive, or an untimely birth, as <HI>the lea&s;t of the apo&s;tles, not meet to be called an apo&s;tle;</HI> and, as if this were not enough, he formed a word on purpo&s;e to expre&s;s his humility, &s;tyling him&s;elf Elachi&s;toteron, <HI>le&s;s than the lea&s;t of the &s;aints;</HI> nay, <HI>the very chief of &s;inners.</HI></P>
<P>HOW freely and frequently does he confe&s;s, that, before his conver&s;ion, he was a bla&s;|phemer, a per&s;ecutor, a per&s;on that injured both God and man: though honoured with the highe&s;t grace and favour, taken up to an immediate conver&s;e with God in heaven yet he never &s;hewed the lea&s;t loftine&s;s over his brethren; he was intru&s;ted with the
<PB N="334" REF="029927_0355_0FE339D5A896B388">
greate&s;t power and authority in the church, but never affected to govern the faith of men; he only endeavoured to be an helper to their joy. How &s;tudiou&s;ly did he decline all the honours and commendations that were heaped upon him: when &s;ome in the church of Corinth magnified him, and, under the patronage of his name, began to &s;et up for a party, he &s;everely rebuked them, told them that it was CHRIST, not he that was crucified for them; that they had not been baptized in his name, nor did he remember to have baptized above three or four of them, and was heartily glad he had no oftener per|formed the ceremony, le&s;t a foundation might have been laid, from that circum&s;tance, for charging him with Judaizing.</P>
<P>ST. PAUL's temperance and &s;obriety were remarkable, for he often abridged him&s;elf of the conveniency of lawful and nece&s;&s;ary accommodations: his hungerings and thir&s;tings were frequent: by which means he reduced the extravagancy of the &s;en&s;ual appetites to a perfect &s;ubjection of the law of rea&s;on. Hence he ea&s;ily got above the world, with all its charms and frowns, and his mind was continually conver&s;ant in heaven, where his thoughts were fixed, and whither his de&s;ires always a&s;cended. What he taught to others, he practi&s;ed him&s;elf; his conver&s;ation was in heaven, and his de&s;ires were to depart, and to be with CHRIST. This world neither arre&s;ted his affection nor di&s;turbed his fears: he was neither plea&s;ed with its applau&s;es, nor terrified with its threatenings: he &s;tudied not to plea&s;e men, nor valued the cen&s;ures they pa&s;&s;ed upon him: he was not greedy of a great e&s;tate, titles of honour, or rich pre&s;ents from men; food and raiment was his bill of fare, and more than this he never cared for; accounting, that the le&s;s he was clogged with the&s;e things the lighter he &s;hould pa&s;s to heaven, e&s;pecially as he was travelling through a world over-run with trouble and per&s;ecutions. And hence it is very probable, that he always led a &s;ingle life, though &s;ome of the ancients rank him among&s;t tho&s;e apo&s;tles that were married.</P>
<P>NO le&s;s exemplary was his kindne&s;s and charity; for he had a compa&s;&s;ionate tender|ne&s;s for the poor and a quick &s;en&s;e of the wants of others. To which church &s;oever he came, it was always one of his fir&s;t cares to make provi&s;ion for the poor and to &s;tir up the bounty of the rich and wealthy; nay, he him&s;elf worked often with his own hands, not only to maintain him&s;elf, but al&s;o to help and relieve them; but his charity to the &s;ouls of men was infinitely greater, fearing no angers, refu&s;ing no labours, go|ing through good and evil report, that he might gain men over to the knowledge of the truth, bring them out of the crooked paths of vice and idolatry and place them in the &s;traight way that leadeth to life eternal: nay, &s;o in&s;atiable was his thir&s;t for the good of &s;ouls, that he affirms that he would &s;ooner him&s;elf be accur&s;ed from CHRIST, than that his countrymen &s;hould mi&s;carry. And as he was infinitely &s;olicitous to gain them over to the religion of the Son of God, &s;o he was equally careful to keep them from being &s;educed from it; ready to &s;u&s;pect every thing that might cor|rupt their minds from the &s;implicity that is in CHRIST: <HI>I am jealous over you,</HI> &s;ays he to the church of Corinth, <HI>with a Godly jealou&s;y:</HI> an affection of all others the mo&s;t active and vigilant, and which in&s;pires men with the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate care and concern for the good of tho&s;e for whom they have the highe&s;t degree of love and kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>NOR was his charity to men greater than his zeal for God, labouring with all his might to promote the honour of his ma&s;ter. How remarkable zealous was he while he continued a member of the Jewi&s;h religion, of the tradition of the father! How earne&s;t to vindicate and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ert the divinity of the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation, and to per&s;e|cute all who were of a contrary faith, even to rage and madne&s;s? And when his zeal was afterwards turned into a right channel, it ran with &s;wift current, carrying
<PB N="335" REF="029927_0356_0FE339D72EDEF660">
him out again&s;t all oppo&s;ition, to vanqui&s;h the kingdom and the powers of darkne&s;s, to beat down idolatry, and plant the world with the right apprehen&s;ions of God, and the true knowledge of religion. When at Athens he &s;aw them involved in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry, and giving the honour that was due to God alone to &s;tatues and images, this fired his zeal, and he could not but let them know the re&s;entment of his mind, and how greatly they di&s;honoured God, the great maker and pre&s;erver of the world. This zeal mu&s;t have rendered him remarkably diligent and indu&s;trious in the execution of his office, warning, reproving, entreating, per&s;uading, preaching in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on, by night and by day, by &s;ea and by land: he thought no pains too much to be taken, no dangers too great to be overcome.</P>
<P>FOR thirty-five years after his conver&s;ion he &s;eldom &s;taid long in one place, travelling from Jeru&s;alem through Arabia, A&s;ia, and Greece, to Illyricum, to Rome, and to the utmo&s;t bounds of the we&s;tern world, preaching the go&s;pel of CHRIST. Running, &s;ays St. Jerom, from ocean to ocean, like the &s;un in the heavens, of which it is &s;aid, his cir|cuit is from the one end of the heavens to the other, &s;ooner wanting ground to tread on, than a de&s;ire to propagate the faith of CHRIST. Nicephorus compares him to a bird in the air, which, in a few years flew round the world: I&s;idore, to a winged hu&s;|bandman, who flew from place to place, to cultivate the world with the mo&s;t exact rules and in&s;titutions of life. And while the other apo&s;tles confined them&s;elves, as it were, to one foot, choo&s;ing this or that particular province and place for their mini&s;try, St. Paul over-ran the whole world to its utmo&s;t bounds and corners, planting all places where he came with the divine doctrines of the go&s;pel. Nor in this cour&s;e was he tired with the dangers and difficulties he met with, the troubles and oppo&s;itions that were rai&s;ed again&s;t him: but all the&s;e &s;erved only to reflect a greater lu&s;tre on his patience; of which he was a mo&s;t eminent pattern, enduring the greate&s;t troubles and per&s;ecutions, with a pa|tience triumphant and unconquerable.</P>
<P>THIS will ea&s;ily appear if we take a &s;urvey of what trials and &s;ufferings he under|went; &s;ome part whereof are thus briefly &s;ummed up by him&s;elf: <HI>In labours abundant, in &s;tripes above mea&s;ure, in pri&s;ons frequent, in deaths oft; thrince beaten with rods, once &s;toned, thrice &s;uffered &s;hipwreck, a night and a day in the deep: in journeyings often, in perils of water, in perils by his countrymen, in perils by the Heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilder|ne&s;s, in perils in the &s;ea, in perils amongst fal&s;e brethren: in wearine&s;s, in painfulne&s;s, in watchings often, in hunger and thir&s;t; in fa&s;tings often, in cold and nakedne&s;s; and be&s;ides tho&s;e things that were without, which daily came upon him, the care of all the churches.</HI> An account, though very great, yet far &s;hort of what he endured. All which he cheerfully underwent with a &s;oul as calm and &s;erene as the morning &s;un; no malice or rage, nor fury or &s;torms, could ruffle or di&s;compo&s;e his &s;pirit: nay, they animated him to ri&s;e up with the greater eagerne&s;s and re&s;olution to perform his duty. Could all the powers of men and devils, &s;pite and oppo&s;ition, torments and threatenings, have been able to baffle him out of that religion he had embraced, he mu&s;t have de&s;erted his &s;tation: but his &s;oul was &s;teeled with a courage and re&s;olution that was impenetrable; and on which no temptation, either from hopes or fears, could make any more impre&s;&s;ion, than an arrow &s;hot again&s;t a wall of adamant.</P>
<P>HE did not want &s;olicitations both from Jews and Gentiles; and might, doubtle&s;s, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, have made his own terms, would he have been fal&s;e to his tru&s;t, and quitted that way which was then every where &s;poken again&s;t. But, alas! the&s;e things weighed little with our apo&s;tle, who <HI>counted not his life dear unto him, &s;o that he might fini&s;h his cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try which he had received of the Lord Je&s;us;</HI> and therefore, when he thought him&s;elf under the &s;entence of death, could

triumphantly &s;ay, <HI>I have fought a good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the faith.</HI> In &s;hort, he was a man in whom the divine life eminently di&s;played it&s;elf; he lived piou&s;ly and devoutly, &s;oberly and temperately, ju&s;tly and righteou&s;ly; careful <HI>always to keep a con&s;cience void of offence both towards God and man.</HI> This, he tells us, was his &s;up|port under all his &s;ufferings; this the foundation of his confidence towards God, and his firm hopes of happine&s;s in another world. <HI>This is our rejoicing the te&s;timony of our con|&s;cience, that in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity we have had our conver&s;ation in the world.</HI> In &s;hort, as the love of this great apo&s;tle to his divine Ma&s;ter knew no bounds, &s;o the beauty and energy of his writings, as well as his &s;ufferings in &s;upport of the truth he e&s;pou&s;ed and inculcated, are beyond example.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE of ST. JAMES the APOSTLE, &s;urnamed the GREAT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS apo&s;tle was a native of Galilee, born in all probability either at Capernaum or Beth&s;aida, as he was a partner with Simon Peter in the fi&s;hing trade. The epithet of Great was given him, to di&s;tingui&s;h him from another apo&s;tle of the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>HE was the &s;on of Zebedee, a fi&s;herman, who kept &s;everal &s;ervants to carry on his trade, and therefore mu&s;t have been a per&s;on of con&s;equence in his way. His mother's name was Mary, &s;urnamed Salome, the daughter of Cleophas, and &s;i&s;ter, or rather cou&s;in-german to Mary the mother of our Lord; &s;o that he had the honour of being a near relation to CHRIST him&s;elf. He was brought up to the trade of his father; a mean occupation, indeed, in the eye of the world, but no employment is mean that is hone&s;t and indu&s;trious; and it &s;hould be remembered that the Son of God him&s;elf &s;tooped &s;o low, as to become the reputed &s;on of a carpenter, and during the retirement of his private life, laboured him&s;elf at his father's trade; not merely devoting him&s;elf to contemplations, nor withdrawing from all u&s;eful &s;ociety with the world, and hiding him&s;elf in the &s;olitudes of an anchoret, but bu&s;ying him&s;elf in an active cour&s;e of life, as he continually went about doing good to the &s;ouls and bodies of mankind.</P>
<P>NOT in the lea&s;t di&s;couraged at the meanne&s;s of his father's trade, St. James applied him&s;elf to it with remarkable a&s;&s;iduity, and was exerci&s;ing his employment when the Saviour of the world pa&s;&s;ing by the &s;ea of Galilee, &s;aw him with his brother in the &s;hip, and called them both to be his di&s;ciples. Nor was the call in vain; they cheerfully complied with it, and immediately left all to follow him: they did not &s;tay to di&s;pute his commands, or &s;olicitou&s;ly inquire into the minute con&s;equences of the undertaking, the troubles and dangers that might attend this new employment; but readily delivered them&s;elves up to perform whatever &s;ervice he &s;hould call them to.</P>
<P>HE was called &s;oon after this from the &s;tation of an ordinary di&s;ciple, to the apo&s;tolical office, and even honoured with &s;ome particular favours beyond mo&s;t of the apo&s;tles, being one of the three whom our Lord made choice of, as his companion in the more intimate tran&s;actions of his life, from which the re&s;t were excluded. Thus, with Peter and his brother John, he attended his Ma&s;ter when he rai&s;ed the daughter of Jairus from the dead; he was admitted to CHRIST's glorious transfiguration on the mount, and heard the di&s;cour&s;es that pa&s;&s;ed between him and the great mini&s;ters from the courts of heaven: and when the holy JESUS was to undergo his bitter agony in the garden, as pre|paratory &s;ufferings to his pa&s;&s;ion, James was one of the three taken to be a &s;pectator of them.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="029927_0358_0FE339E01FA07368">IT is not ea&s;y to determine what rea&s;ons induced the Redeemer of mankind to ad|mit tho&s;e three apo&s;tles to peculiar acts of favour; though he doubtle&s;s did it for wi&s;e and proper ends. Whether he de&s;igned the&s;e three to be more &s;olemn and peculiar witne&s;&s;es of &s;ome remarkable tran&s;actions of his life than the other apo&s;tles; or that they would be more eminently u&s;eful and &s;erviceable in &s;ome parts of the apo&s;tolic office; or to encourage them thereby to prepare for the &s;ufferings that would attend them in the mi|ni&s;try; or whether he de&s;igned them for &s;ome more eminent kinds of matyrdom than the re&s;t of his di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>IT was not the lea&s;t in&s;tance of particular honour that our Lord conferred on the&s;e apo&s;tles, when he called them to the apo&s;tolate, that he gave them a new name and title. A thing not uncommon of old, for the Almighty often impo&s;ed new names on per&s;ons, when he intended them for &s;ome great and peculiar &s;ervices and employments; in&s;tan|ces of this we have in Abraham and Jacob. Accordingly our Lord, at the election of the&s;e three apo&s;tles, gave them new names: Simon he called <HI>Peter,</HI> or a rock, and James and John, <HI>Boanerges,</HI> or the &s;ons of thunder. What our Lord intended by their &s;urnames is much ea&s;ier to conjecture than determine; &s;ome think it was given them on account of their being pre&s;ent in the mount, when a voice came out of the cloud, &s;aying, <HI>This is my beloved &s;on,</HI> &amp;c. for when the people heared the &s;ame voice at another time, they &s;aid "It thundered." But this ob&s;ervation is in it&s;elf very incon&s;iderable, becau&s;e it was equally applicable to Peter as to them. Others think that it was given them on account of their loud and bold &s;peaking the go&s;pel to the world, fearing no threatenings, di&s;pi&s;ing all oppo&s;ition, and going on thundering in the ears of a drow&s;y and &s;leepy world; rou&s;ing and awakening the con&s;ciences of men with the earne&s;tne&s;s and vehemence of their preaching, which re&s;embled thunder, as the voice of God power|fully &s;hakes the natural world, and breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. Others think it relates to the doctrines they delivered, teaching the great my&s;teries of the go&s;pel in a more profound and loftier &s;train than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>HOW far the latter opinion might be true with regard to St. James, the &s;criptures are wholly &s;ilent; but it was certainly verified in his brother John, who&s;e go&s;pel is &s;o full of the more &s;ublime notions and my&s;teries of the go&s;pel concerning the divinity, pre|exi&s;tence, &amp;c. of CHRIST, that he is generally affirmed by the ancients to thunder ra|ther than &s;peak. Perhaps the expre&s;&s;ions may denote no more than that in general they were to be prime and eminent mini&s;ters, in this new &s;tate of things; the intro|ducing the go&s;pel or evangelical di&s;pen&s;ation, being called "a voice &s;haking the heaven and the earth," and therefore exactly corre&s;pondent to the native importance of the word, &s;ignifying an <HI>earthquake,</HI> or a vehement commotion, that like thunder, makes an alarming noi&s;e.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this be, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour doubtle&s;s by this term alluded to the furious and re&s;olute di&s;po&s;itions of the&s;e two brothers, who &s;eem to have been of a more fiery temper than the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles, of which we have this memorable in&s;tance. When our Lord was determined on his journey to Jeru&s;alem, he &s;ent &s;ome of his di&s;ciples before him to make preparation for his coming; but, on their entering a village of Samaria, were rudely rejected, from the old grudge that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Samaritans and the Jews, and becau&s;e our Saviour, by going up to Jeru&s;alem, &s;eemed to flight their place of wor&s;hip on mount Garizim.</P>
<P>THIS piece of rudene&s;s and inhumanity was &s;o highly re&s;ented by St. James and his brother John, that they came to JESUS, de&s;iring to know if he would not imitate Elias, by calling down fire from heaven to con&s;ume this barbarous, inho&s;pitable people. So

But the holy JESUS &s;oon convinced them of their mi&s;take, by telling them, that he was come to &s;ave the lives of the children of men, and not to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>WE have no account from &s;acred hi&s;tory, what became of St. James after the a&s;|cen&s;ion of his great and beloved Ma&s;ter. Sophronius tells us, that he preached to the di&s;per&s;ed Jews, that is, to tho&s;e converts who were di&s;per&s;ed after the death of Stephen. The Spani&s;h writers will have it, that after preaching the go&s;pel in &s;everal parts of Judea and Samaria, he vi&s;ited Spain, where he planted Chri&s;tianity, and appointed &s;ome &s;elect di&s;ciples to perfect what he had begun; but if we con&s;ider the &s;hortne&s;s of St. James's life, and that the apo&s;tles continued in a body at Jeru&s;alem, even after the di&s;per&s;ion of the other Chri&s;tians, we &s;hall find it difficult to allow time &s;ufficient for &s;o tedious and difficult a voyage as that was in tho&s;e early ages; and therefore it is &s;afe&s;t to confine his mini&s;try to Judea and the countries bordering upon it.</P>
<P>WE learn from profane hi&s;tory, that Herod Agrippa, &s;on of Ari&s;tobulus and grand|&s;on of Herod the Great, had been a great favourite both with the emperor Caligula and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Claudius, who conferred on his grandfather's kingdoms, and &s;ent him into Judea. Herod was noble and generous, prudent and politic, thoroughly ver&s;ed in all the arts and intrigues of a court; he knew how to oblige his enemies, and molify or avert the di&s;plea&s;ure of the emperor. He was of a courteous and affable di&s;po&s;ition; but at the &s;ame time a great zealot of the Jewi&s;h religion, and a very ac|curate ob&s;erver of the Mo&s;aic law. This prince, at his arrival in his new kingdom, though there was no &s;urer way of ingratiating him&s;elf into the favour of the populace, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by per&s;ecuting the Chri&s;tians, whom he knew the Jews dete&s;ted. Accordingly, he began a violent per&s;ecution; but the commonalty being too mean a &s;acrifice to &s;atisfy his own zeal, and favour his popular de&s;igns, he laid hands on St. James, who&s;e active temper and vigorous manner of contending for the truth and excellency of the Chri&s;tian religion, rendered him a proper victim at this time.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame zeal which animated Herod to lay hands on St. James, al&s;o prompted him to pa&s;s &s;entence of death on him immediately. As he was led to the place of exe|cution, the officer that guarded him to the tribunal, or rather his accu&s;er, having been converted by that remarkable courage and con&s;tancy &s;hewn by the apo&s;tle at the time of his trial, repented of what he had done, came and fell down at the apo&s;tle's feet, and heartily begged pardon for what he had &s;aid again&s;t him. The holy man, after recovering from the &s;urpri&s;e, tenderly embraced him. "Peace," &s;aid he, "my &s;on peace be to thee, and the pardon of the faults." Upon which the officer publicly de|clared him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, and both were beheaded at the &s;ame time. Thus fell the great apo&s;tle James, the fir&s;t protomartyr of the apo&s;tles, the fir&s;t of that number that gained the crown, taking cheerfully that cup of which he had long &s;ince told his Lord he was ready to drink.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the divine vengeance, that never &s;leeps, would not &s;uffer the death of this innocent and righteous man to pa&s;s long unrevenged; for &s;hortly after the mar|tyrdom of St. James, Herod removed to Ce&s;area, in order to make war on the neigh|bouring Tyrians and Sidonians; and while he continued in this city, he proclaimed &s;olemn fights and fe&s;tival entertainments to be held in honour of Cae&s;ar to which there flocked a prodigious confluence of the principal inhabitants of the ajacent parts. Early in the morning of the &s;econd day, he came with great &s;tate into the theatre, to make
<PB N="339" REF="029927_0360_0FE339E3EF9676F0">
as oration to the people; and being clothed in a robe curiou&s;ly wrought with &s;ilver, the beams of the &s;un were reflected from it with &s;uch lu&s;tre, that the people cried out, that it was &s;ome deity they beheld; and that he who &s;poke to them mu&s;t be &s;ome|thing above the common &s;tandard of humanity.</P>
<P>THIS impious applau&s;e Herod received without the lea&s;t token of di&s;like, or &s;en&s;e of the injury that was done by it to the Supreme Being. But a &s;udden accident changed the &s;cene, and turned their mirth and rejoicing into melancholy and mourning; for Herod looking up, &s;aw an owl perched upon a rope over his head, which he con&s;idered as the fatal mini&s;ter of his death; on which an incurable melancholy &s;eized his mind, and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torments his bowels, occa&s;ioned by tho&s;e worms St. Luke men|tions; &s;o that turning to the people, he cried out, "Behold the deity you admired, and your&s;elves evidently convinced of flattery and fal&s;ehood; &s;ee me this moment con|demned by the laws of fate to die, whom ju&s;t now you &s;tyled immortal." He was re|moved into the palace, but his pains &s;till increa&s;ed upon him; and though the people fa&s;ted, and offered prayers for his life and health, yet his accute torments prevailed, and after five days put a period to his life.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE of ST. JAMES the APOSTLE, &s;urnamed the LESS.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we enter upon the life of this apo&s;tle, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to remove &s;ome difficulties relating to his per&s;on. It has been doubted by &s;ome whether this was the &s;ame with that St. James, who was afterwards bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem, two of this name being mentioned in the &s;acred writings, namely, St. James the Great and St. James the Le&s;s, both apo&s;tles; the ancients mention a third, &s;urnamed the Ju&s;t, which they will have to be di&s;tinct from the former, and bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem; but this opinion i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> built on a &s;andy foundation; for nothing is plainer, than that St. James the apo&s;tle&punc; whom St. Paul calls <HI>our Lord's brother,</HI> and reckons with Peter and John&punc; one of the pillars of the church, was the &s;ame who pre&s;ided among the apo&s;tles, doubtle&s;s by vir|tue of his epi&s;copal office, and determined the cau&s;es in the &s;ynod of Jeru&s;alem. Nor do either Clemens, Alexandrinus, or Eu&s;ebius, mention any more than two, St. James &s;lain by Herod, and St. James the Ju&s;t, bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem, whom they expre&s;sly affirm to be the &s;ame with him who is called the brother of our Lord by St. Paul.</P>
<P>THE difficulties with regard to his per&s;on being thus removed, we &s;hall proceed to the hi&s;tory of his life. It is rea&s;onable to think that he was the &s;on of Jo&s;eph, after|wards the hu&s;band of Mary, by his fir&s;t wife, whom St. Jerom &s;tyles E&s;cha, and adds, that &s;he was the daughter of Aggi, brother to Zacharias, the father of John the Bapti&s;t&punc; hence he was reputed our Lord's brother. We find indeed &s;everal mentioned as the brethren of our Saviour, in the evangelical hi&s;tory; but in what &s;en&s;e, was greatly con|troverted by the ancients. St. Jerom, St. Chry&s;o&s;tom, and &s;ome others, will have them to have been &s;o called from their being the &s;ons of Mary, cou&s;in-german, or according to the Hebrew idiom, &s;i&s;ter to the Virgin Mary: but Eu&s;ebius, Epiphanius, and many others tell us, they were the children of Jo&s;eph by a former wife; and this &s;eems mo&s;t natural, and be&s;t agrees with what the evangeli&s;t &s;ays of them, when he enumerates the que&s;tions of the Jews: <HI>Is not this the carpenter's &s;on? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brethren, James, and Jo&s;es, and Simeon and Judas? And his &s;i&s;ters, are they not all with us? Whence then has this man the&s;e things?</HI> By which it is plain that the Jews under&s;tood the&s;e per&s;ons not to be CHRIST's kin&s;man only, but his brethren; the &s;ame carpenter's &s;ons having the &s;ame relation to him, that JESUS him&s;elf had: indeed they had more, CHRIST being only his reputed, they his natural &s;ons. Upon this account, the ble&s;&s;ed

Virgin is &s;ometimes called the mother of James and Jo&s;es; and by this name we fre|quently find her mentioned by the evangeli&s;ts in relating our Lord's crucifixion: and though &s;he was only mother-in-law to St. James, yet the evangeli&s;ts might choo&s;e to &s;tyle her &s;o, becau&s;e &s;he was commonly called his mother after the death of Jo&s;eph: perhaps &s;he her&s;elf cho&s;e that title, that the Son of God, whom as a virgin &s;he had brought into the world, might be the better concealed, and le&s;s expo&s;ed to the envious malice of the Jews. To this it may be added, that Jo&s;ephus, who was eminently &s;killed in matters of genealogy and de&s;cent, expre&s;sly &s;ays, that St. James was the brother of JESUS CHRIST. There is indeed one objection again&s;t this, namely, that he is called <HI>the &s;on of Alpheus:</HI> but this may mean no more, than either that Jo&s;eph was called by another name, a thing very common among the Jews, or that James him&s;elf was a di&s;|ciple of &s;ome particular &s;ect or &s;ynagogue called Alpheans, there being many &s;uch &s;ects about this time among&s;t the Jews.</P>
<P>THE &s;acred hi&s;tory is &s;ilent with regard to the place of his birth: the Jews in their Talmud, calls him a man of the town of Sechania: but where that place was &s;ituated is uncertain: nor is it known what his particular way or cour&s;e of life was before he was called to the apo&s;tle&s;hip: the &s;acred writers having been &s;ilent with regard to this par|ticular, mentioning nothing concerning him during the life of our Saviour.</P>
<P>ST. JAMES was honoured, after the re&s;urrection, with a particular appearance of our Lord to him, which, though pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence by the evangeli&s;ts, is recorded by St. Paul, St. Jerom, from the Hebrew go&s;pel of the Nazarenes, which contain &s;everal par|ticulars omitted by the evangelical hi&s;torians, gives the following relation of his appear|an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to this apo&s;tle. St. James had &s;olemnly &s;worn, that from the time he had drank of the cup at the in&s;titution of the &s;upper, he would eat bread no more, till he &s;aw the Lord ri&s;en from the dead; our Lord, therefore, being returned from the grave, came and appeared to him, and commanded bread to be &s;et before him, which he took, ble&s;&s;ed, and brake, and gave to St. James; &s;aying, "Eat thy bread, my brother, for the Son of man is truly ri&s;en from among&s;t them that &s;leep."</P>
<P>AFTER the re&s;urrection of our Saviour, he was cho&s;en bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem, being preferred before all the re&s;t for his near relation to CHRIST; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, we find Simeon cho&s;en to be his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or in that &s;ee, becau&s;e, after St. James, he was our Lord's next kin&s;man; a con&s;ideration that made Peter and the two &s;ons of Zebedee, though they had been peculiarly honoured by our Saviour, not to contend for this high and honourable &s;tation, but freely cho&s;e James the Ju&s;t, bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem. This dignity is indeed &s;aid by &s;ome of the ancients to have been conferred on him by CHRIST, who con&s;tituted him bi&s;hop at the time of his appearing to him: but it is &s;afe&s;t to follow the general opinion, that this dignity was conferred upon him by the apo&s;tles; though po&s;&s;ibly they might receive &s;ome intimations from our Lord concerning it.</P>
<P>ST. PAUL, when he came to Jeru&s;alem, after his conver&s;ion, applied to St. James and was by him honoured with the righthand of fellow&s;hip: and Peter &s;ent to St. James the news of his miraculous deliverance out of pri&s;on, <HI>Go,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>&s;hew the&s;e things unto James, and to the brethern;</HI> that is, to the whole church, e&s;pecially to St. James the pa&s;tor of it at that time.</P>
<P>THIS apo&s;tle was remarkable active in the &s;ynod of Jeru&s;alem, when the great cau&s;e relating to the Mo&s;aic rites was debated; for the cau&s;e being opened by Peter, and further debated by Paul and Barnabas, St. James &s;tood up to pa&s;s the final decretory &s;entence,&mdash;That the Gentile converts were not to be loaded with the Jewi&s;h yoke; a
<PB N="341" REF="029927_0362_0FE339EE6355C2D8">
few indifferent rites only being ordered to be ob&s;erved in order to produce an accom|modation between the Jews and Gentiles, u&s;hering in the expedient with this po&s;itive conclu&s;ion, "This is my &s;entence and determination:" a circum&s;tance the more con|&s;iderable, becau&s;e &s;poken at a time when Peter was in council, and produced not the lea&s;t intimation of the authority afterwards a&s;cribed to him.</P>
<P>ST. JAMES performed every part of his charge with all po&s;&s;ible care and indu&s;try, omitting no particular nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved by a diligent and faithful guide of &s;ouls; &s;trengthening the weak, in&s;tructing the ignorant, reducing the erroneous, re|proving the ob&s;tinate; and, by the con&s;tancy of his &s;ermons, conquering the &s;tubborn|ne&s;s of that perver&s;e and refractory generation he had to deal with, many of the nobler and better &s;ort being per&s;uaded to embrace the Chri&s;tian faith: but a per&s;on &s;o careful, &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in his charge, could not fail of awakening the &s;pite and malice of his enemies; a &s;ort of men of whom the apo&s;tle has given too true a character, that <HI>they plea&s;e not God, and are contrary to all men.</HI></P>
<P>THE Jews being vexed to &s;ee St. Paul had e&s;caped their hands by appealing unto Cae&s;ar, their malice became as great and in&s;atiable as hell it&s;elf, &s;o that as they could not have their revenge on St. Paul, they turned their fury again&s;t St. James; but being unable to effect their de&s;ign under the government of Fe&s;tus, they determined to attempt it under the procurator&s;hip of Albinus his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Ananus the younger, of the &s;ect of the Sadducees, being high-prie&s;t. They were however fearful that Albinus would op|po&s;e their de&s;ign, and therefore thought it the &s;ure&s;t method to di&s;patch him, if po&s;&s;ible, before the new governor arrived. In order to this, a council was &s;ummoned, and the apo&s;tle, with others, arraigned and condemned as violat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs of the law: but that the action might appear more plau&s;ible and popular, the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, ma&s;ters in the art of di&s;&s;imulation, endeavoured to in&s;nare him, that they had placed the greate&s;t confidence in him; that the whole nation, as well as they, gave him the title of a ju&s;t man, and one that was no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons; that they therefore de&s;ired he would correct the error and fal&s;e opinion the people had conceived of JESUS, whom they con|&s;idered as the Me&s;&s;iah, and take this opportunity of the univer&s;al confluence to the pa&s;|chal &s;olemnity, to &s;et them right in their opinions in this particular, and would go with them to the top of the temple, where he might be &s;een and heard by all the people.</P>
<P>TO this the apo&s;tle readily con&s;ented, and being advantageou&s;ly placed on a pinnacle of the temple, they addre&s;&s;ed him in the following manner: "Tell us O Ju&s;tus! whom we have all the rea&s;on in the world to believe, that the people are thus generally led away with the doctrine of JESUS, who was crucified; tell us, what is this in&s;titution of the crucified JESUS?" To which the apo&s;tle an&s;wered, with an audible voice: "Why do you enquire of JESUS, the Son of man? He &s;its in heaven at the right hand of the Maje&s;ty on high, and will come again in the clouds of heaven." The people below hearing this, glorified the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, and openly proclaimed, "Ho&s;anna to the Son of David."</P>
<P>HEREUPON the Scribes and Phari&s;ees perceived that they had acted fooli&s;hly; that, in&s;tead of reclaiming, they had confirmed the people in their error; and that there was no way left but to di&s;patch him immediately, in order to warn others, by his &s;ufferings, not to believe in JESUS of Nazareth: accordingly they &s;uddenly cried out, That Ju&s;tus him&s;elf was &s;educed and become an impo&s;tor; and immediately threw him from the pinnacle or which he &s;tood, into the court below; but not being killed on the &s;pot, he recovered him&s;elf &s;o far as to ri&s;e on his knees, and pray fervently to heaven for his murderers: but malice is too diabolical to be pacified with kindne&s;s, or &s;atisfied with cruelty: little portions of revenge &s;erve only to enflame it, and rou&s;e it up to greater
<PB N="342" REF="029927_0363_0FE339F0ADD590F8">
acts of cruelty. Accordingly, his enemies, vexed that they had not fully accompli&s;hed their work, they poured a &s;hower of &s;tones upon him, while he was imploring their forgivne&s;s at the throne of grace; and one of them, more merciful than the re&s;t, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er's club put an end to his mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>THIS great and good man thus fini&s;hed his cour&s;e in the ninety-&s;ixth year of his age, and about twenty-four years after our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven. His death was lamented by all good men, even by the &s;ober and ju&s;t per&s;ons among&s;t the Jews them&s;elves, as Jo&s;ephus him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es. He was buried, according to Gregory of Tours, on Mount Olivet, in a tomb he had built for him&s;elf, and in which he had bu|ried Zacharias and old Simeon. Heje&s;ippus &s;ays, he was buried in the court of the tem|ple, where he &s;uffered martyrdom, and that a monument was there erected to his me|mory: but the former &s;eems more agreeable to rea&s;on; for the Jews very rarely buried any per&s;on in the city, much le&s;s in the courts of the temple; and therefore, it is not natural to think they would permit that honour to be paid to him they &s;o lately put to death as an impo&s;tor and deceiver.</P>
<P>ST. JAMES was a man of exemplary piety and devotion, educated under the &s;tricte&s;t rules and in&s;titutions of religion, a prie&s;t of the ancient order of the Rechabites, or ra|ther as Epiphanius conjectures, according to the mo&s;t ancient order and form of prie&s;t|hood, when the &s;acerdotal office was the prerogative of the fir&s;t-born; but whether this kind of prie&s;thood was at any time ob&s;erved under the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation, we are no where told in Sacred Writ; but however that be, it is certain that he had the privilege of entering the &s;anctuary, or holy place, when he plea&s;ed, though none but prie&s;ts of the order of Aaron were permitted to enter there be&s;ides him&s;elf. Prayer was his con|&s;tant bu&s;ine&s;s and delight; he &s;eemed to live upon it, and to have continually his con|ver&s;ation in heaven; and, therefore, u&s;ed con&s;tantly to repair into the temple to pray, which he always performed kneeling, and with the greate&s;t reverence, till by his daily devotions, his knees were become hard and callous like tho&s;e of a camel. And he who has told us, that <HI>the prayer of a righteous man availeth much,</HI> found it &s;o by his own ex|perience, heaven lending a more immediate ear to his petitions; &s;o that in a time of re|markable drought, on his praying for rain, the clouds melted into fruitful &s;howers, and relived the nece&s;&s;ities of the people.</P>
<P>HIS charity towards men was not le&s;s &s;ingular than his piety towards God; he did good to all, watched over the &s;ouls of men, and &s;tudied to advance their eternal welfare; his daily errand into the temple was to pray for the happine&s;s of the people, and that God would not &s;everely reckon with them; he could forgive his mo&s;t inveterate enemies, and overcome evil with good: when thrown from the top of the temple, he made u&s;e of his late&s;t breath in &s;ending up petitions to heaven for the pardon of his murderers, "I be&s;eech thee, O Almighty Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."</P>
<P>THIS apo&s;tle was of a remarkable meek and humble temper, honouring what was excellent in others, concealing what was valuable in him&s;elf: neither the eminency of his relation to the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, nor the dignity of the place he &s;o worthily filled, could induce him to entertain lofty thoughts of him&s;elf above the re&s;t of his brethren; on the contrary, he &s;trove to conceal whatever might place him in a higher rank than the other di&s;ciples of the Lord of glory. Though he was brother to the Redeemer of mankind, he &s;tyles him&s;elf only the &s;ervant of our Lord JESUS CHRIST; not &s;o much as mentioning his being an apo&s;tle of his divine Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>HE was a per&s;on of extraordinary temperance, wholly ab&s;taining from fle&s;h, drinking neither wine nor &s;trong drink, and never u&s;ing the bath. His holy and mortified mind
<PB N="343" REF="029927_0364_0FE339F232C2A8D0">
was contented with the meane&s;t accommodations; he went bare-foot, and never wore any other than linen garments. He lived indeed after the &s;tricte&s;t rules of the Nazarite order; and as the mitre he wore on his head evinced his prie&s;thood, which was rather from Malchizedek than Aaron; &s;o his never &s;having his head, or u&s;ing any ointments, his habit and diet, and the great &s;everity of his life, &s;hewed him to belong to the Naza|rite in&s;titution, to which he was con&s;ecrated, even from his mother's womb. A man of &s;o divine a temper, that he was at once the love and wonder of his age; and from the reputation of his holy and religious life, was &s;tyled <HI>James the Ju&s;t.</HI> He was indeed the &s;afety and happine&s;s of the nation, which was reckoned to depend upon his prayers and intere&s;t with heaven, and hence he acquired the title of <HI>Oblias,</HI> or <HI>Ozliam,</HI> the <HI>defence and fortre&s;s of the people;</HI> indicating, that when he was no more, their ca&s;tles would be di&s;|mantled and their &s;trength laid level with the ground: and &s;o indeed it proved; for a few years after his death, the Roman army broke in upon them, and filled the country with blood and &s;laughter. It is indeed no wonder that the judgments of the Almighty, like a flood, &s;hould come rolling in upon a nation, when the &s;luices are plucked up, and Mo&s;es taken away that &s;tood in the gap to oppo&s;e them. In &s;hort, St. James was the de|light of all good men, and in &s;o great favour and e&s;timation with the people, that they u&s;ed to flock after him, and &s;trive who &s;hould touch, if it were only the border of his garment; his very epi&s;copal chair, as Eu&s;ebius informs us, wherein he u&s;ed to &s;it, was carefully pre&s;erved, and had a kind of veneration paid it, even in his time. He was beloved not only by his friends, but al&s;o by his enemies, and the Jews themel&s;ves men|tion St. James in their Talmud, as a per&s;on who wrought miracles in the name of JESUS his Ma&s;ter; and the wi&s;e&s;t of them con&s;idered his martyrdom as the principal cau&s;e of all tho&s;e calamities that &s;oon after flowed in upon them. Jo&s;ephus in particular reckons the death of St. James, as the action that more immediately rou&s;ed the divine vengeance, and ha&s;tened the univer&s;al ruin of that nation by the Roman armies.</P>
<P>THIS apo&s;tle wrote only one epi&s;tle, probably not long before his martyrdom, as appears from &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in it relating to the near approach of the de&s;truction of the Jews: he directed it to the Jewi&s;h converts di&s;per&s;ed up and down tho&s;e ea&s;tern countries, to com|fort them under their &s;ufferings, and confirm them again&s;t error: he &s;aw a great degene|racy of manners coming on, and that the purity of the Chri&s;tian faith began to be under|mined by the doctrines and practices of the Gno&s;tics, who, under pretence of zeal for the legal rites, generally mixed them&s;elves with the Jews: He beheld libertini&s;m flowing in apace, and the way to heaven made &s;oft and ea&s;y, men declaiming again&s;t good works as u&s;ele&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary, and a&s;&s;erting that a naked belief was &s;ufficient to &s;alvation. The&s;e doctrines the apo&s;tle oppo&s;es, pre&s;&s;es the purity, patience, charity, and all the vir|tues of a good life; and by undeniable arguments proves, that &s;uch a faith alone, which has CHRIST for its object, and works by love and holine&s;s, can ju&s;tify us before God&punc; and procure our admittance into the cele&s;tial kingdom of eternal glory.</P>

<HEAD>The LIFE of ST. PETER, the APOSTLE to the JEWS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS remarkable apo&s;tle and di&s;ciple of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour was born at Beth&s;aida, a city of Galilee, &s;ituate on the banks of the lake of Gene&s;areth, called al&s;o the &s;ea of Galilee, from its being &s;ituated in that country; and the lake of Tiberias, from that city being built on its banks: but the particular time of this great apo&s;tle's birth cannot be known; the evangeli&s;ts, and other writers among the primitive Chri&s;tians, having been &s;ilent with regard to this particular. It is, however, pretty certain, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was at lea&s;t ten years older than his Ma&s;ter; the circum&s;tances of his being married, and in a &s;ettled cour&s;e of life, when he became a follower of the great Me&s;&s;iah, and that au|thority

and re&s;pect the gravity of his per&s;on procured him among the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles, &s;ufficiently declare this conjecture to be very far from being improbable.</P>
<P>ST. PETER being a de&s;cendant of Abraham, was circumci&s;ed according to the rites of the Mo&s;aic law, and called by his parents, Simon or Simeon, a name at that time com|mon among the Jews: but after his becoming a di&s;ciple of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, the additional title of Cephas was conferred upon him by his Ma&s;ter, to denote the firmne&s;s of his faith; the word Cephas in the Syriac, the common language of the Jews at that time, &s;ignifying &s;tone or rock: and hence he is called in Greek <HI>Petros,</HI> and by us Peter, which appellation bears the &s;ame meaning.</P>
<P>THE evangeli&s;ts have al&s;o been &s;ilent with regard to the parents of St. Peter, except in telling us, that his father's name was Jonah, probably a fi&s;herman of Beth&s;aida: but what|ever was his trade, he was highly honoured by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who cho&s;e two of his &s;ons, Andrew and Peter, to be his apo&s;tles, and preachers of the glad-tidings of &s;alvation to mankind.</P>
<P>WHILE young, St. Peter was brought up to the trade of fi&s;hing on the lake of Beth|&s;aida, famous for different kinds of fi&s;h, which excelled all others in the finene&s;s of the ta&s;te. Here he clo&s;ely followed this trade: but afterwards removed to Capernaum, pro|bably on his being married, where he &s;ettled; for we find he had a hou&s;e there when our Saviour began his public mini&s;try, and there he paid tribute. Nicephorus tells us, that Helen, the mother Con&s;tantine, erected a beautiful church over the ruins of St. Peter's hou&s;e, in honour of him.</P>
<P>THE town of Capernaum was as well &s;ituated as Beth&s;aida, for the carrying on his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ade, &s;tanding at the influx of the river Jordan into the &s;ea of Galilee, and where he might, with equal advantage, reap the fruits of an hone&s;t and indu&s;trious diligence. The bu&s;ine&s;s of St. Peter was, we confe&s;s, both mean and &s;ervile: it expo&s;ed him to all the injuries of the weather, the tempe&s;tuou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;ea, and the darkne&s;s and horror of the night, and all to acquire a mean livelihood for him&s;elf and his family; but mean|ne&s;s is no exception to the Almighty; the poor, if virtuous, are as dear to heaven as the wealthy, the great and the powerful: the beggar and the monarch are equally regarded by the great Parent of the human race, with whom there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons; and who is the rewarder of all that diligently &s;eek him.</P>
<P>HERE we cannot help ob&s;erving the wi&s;e and admirable methods made u&s;e of by Divine Providence, in making choice of &s;uch mean and unlikely in&s;truments in plant|ing and propagating the Chri&s;tian religion in the world: men who w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re de&s;titute of every advantage of education, and brought up to the meane&s;t employments, were cho&s;en to confound the wi&s;e, and overturn the learning of the prudent. Such were the per&s;ons whom the Almighty &s;ent to propagate the religion of his Son; to &s;ilence the wi&s;e, the &s;cribe, and the di&s;puter of this world, and to make fooli&s;h the wi&s;dom of the earth: for though the Jews required a &s;ign, and the Greeks &s;ought after wi&s;dom; though the preaching of a crucified Saviour was a &s;candal to the former, and fooli&s;hne&s;s to the learn|ed latter; yet by this fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching God was plea&s;ed to &s;ave them that believ|ed; and, in the event, made it appear, that <HI>the fooli&s;hne&s;s of God is wi&s;er than men, and the weakne&s;s of God is &s;tronger than men;</HI> that &s;o the honour of all may redound to him|&s;elf, <HI>that no fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his pre&s;ence, but he that glorieth, &s;hould glory in the Lord,</HI> to whom alone all honour is due.</P>
<P>WE are told of what &s;ect St. Peter was before he became a follower of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is highly probable that he was a di&s;ciple of John the Bapti&s;t. We know that his brother Andrew was a follower of that preacher of repentance; and it is very
<PB N="345" REF="029927_0366_0FE339FEF0828C70">
unlikely that he, who was &s;o ready to carry his brother the early tidings of the Me&s;&s;iah, that the Son of Righteou&s;ne&s;s was already ri&s;en in the&s;e parts, &s;hould not be equally &s;olicitous to bring him under the di&s;cipline and influence of John the Bapti&s;t, the day|&s;tar which appeared to u&s;her in the appearance of the Son of God: be&s;ides, Peter's great readine&s;s and curio&s;ity at the fir&s;t news of CHRIST's appearing, to come to him and conver&s;e with him, &s;hews that his expectations had been awakened, and &s;ome glim|mering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ays of hope conveyed to him by the preaching and mini&s;try of John, who was <HI>the voice of one crying in the wilderne&s;s, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths &s;traight.</HI></P>
<P>WHETHER Peter was or was not a di&s;ciple of John the Bapti&s;t, he became acquainted with the immaculate Lamb of God in the following manner: The ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, having &s;pent thirty years in the &s;olitude of a private life, had lately been bapti&s;ed by John in Jordan, and there owned by the &s;olemn atte&s;tation of heaven to be the Son of God; whereupon he was immediately hurried into the wilderne&s;s, and there for forty days maintained a per&s;onal conte&s;t with the Devil, but having conquered this great enemy of mankind, he returned to Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was bapti&s;ing his pro|&s;elytes, and endeavouring to an&s;wer the Jews, who had &s;ent a deputation to him to enquire concerning the new Me&s;&s;iah that appeared among them. To &s;atisfy the&s;e curi|ous inquires of I&s;rael, John faithfully related every thing he knew concerning him, gave him the greate&s;t character, and &s;oon after pointed him out to his di&s;ciples; upon which two of them pre&s;ently followed the great Redeemer of mankind, one of which was Andrew, Simon's brother. They came to him towards evening, and in all proba|bility &s;tayed with him the whole night, during which time Andrew had an opportunity of informing him&s;elf, and of &s;atisfying his mo&s;t anxious &s;cruples.</P>
<P>HE did not long conceal the joyful di&s;covery he had made; for early in the morn|ing he ha&s;tened to acquaint his brother Simon that he had found the Me&s;&s;iah. It is not enough to be happy alone; religion is a communicative principle, that like the circles in the water, delights to multiply it&s;elf, and to diffu&s;e its influences all around, e&s;pecially on tho&s;e whom nature has placed neare&s;t to us. "I have (&s;aid he with rapture to his brother) found that eminent per&s;on &s;o long and &s;ignally foretold by the prophets, and whom all the devout and pious among&s;t the &s;ons of Jacob &s;o earne&s;tly expected to appear."</P>
<P>ST. PETER, who was one of tho&s;e who waited for Redemption in I&s;rael, ravi&s;hed with joyful news, and impatient of delay, pre&s;ently followed his brother to the place; and, on his arrival, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour immediately gave him a proof of his divinity, &s;aluting him at fir&s;t &s;ight by his name, and telling him both who he was, his name and kindred, and what title &s;hould &s;oon be conferred upon him by the authority of his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>WHETHER the&s;e two &s;ons of Jonah con&s;tantly attended in per&s;on from that time on the great Redeemer of mankind, and became his di&s;ciples, the &s;acred hi&s;tory does not mention. It is however probable, that they &s;tayed with him &s;ome time, till they were in|&s;tructed in the fir&s;t rudiments of his doctrine, and then, by the leave of their great and benevolent Ma&s;ter, returned to their families and to their callings; for it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS was not at this time willing to awaken the jealou&s;ly of the rulers of I&s;rael, and the &s;u&s;picion of the Romans, by a numerous retinue, and therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his di&s;ciples, among&s;t the re&s;t Andrew and Peter, who returned to their trade of fi&s;hing on the lake, where they were afterwards found by our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer.</P>
<P>OUR Lord had now more than a year entered on his public mini&s;try, going into every part of the country, to &s;eek opportunities of doing good to the children of men;
<PB N="346" REF="029927_0367_0FE33A0075CC6A48">
&s;o that by the con&s;tancy of his preaching, and the reputation of his miracles, his fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> was &s;pread throughout all Judea, and multitudes of people flocked to him from all parts to hear his doctrine, and be &s;pectators of his mighty works. And &s;urely it is no won|der that the parched and barren earth thir&s;ted for the kindly dews and &s;howers of heaven, to refre&s;h it.</P>
<P>IN order to avoid this prodigious throng of people, our great Redeemer often retired to &s;ome &s;olitary place, to indulge the privacies of contemplation: in one of the&s;e retreats on the banks of the &s;ea of Galilee, the multitude found him out, and ran to him from the city. Our Saviour, therefore to avoid the crowd, &s;tepped into a fi&s;hing-boat which lay near the &s;hore, and belonged to Simon Peter, who, together with his companions were on &s;hore drying their nets, after an un&s;ucce&s;sful night &s;pent in toil and labour. The ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, who might have commanded, was plea&s;ed to entreat Peter, who now re|turned to his boat, to thru&s;t off a little from the land, that he might in&s;truct the people, who were gathered in prodigious crowds on the borders of the lake, to hear him.</P>
<P>ST. PETER gladly complied with the reque&s;t of his Ma&s;ter, who delivered his heavenly doctrine to the people on the &s;hore. As &s;oon as he had ended his di&s;cour&s;e, he re&s;olved to &s;eal his miracles, that the people might be per&s;uaded he was a <HI>teacher come from God;</HI> accordingly, he ordered Simon to row further from the &s;hore, and ca&s;t his net into the &s;ea. To which Simon an&s;wered, that they had laboured the whole preceding night, and had taken nothing; and if they could not then &s;ucceed, there was little hopes of it now, as the day was far le&s;s proper for fi&s;hing than the night: but as his Ma&s;ter was plea&s;ed to command, he would readily obey; and, accordingly, he let down his net, when, to the a&s;toni&s;hment both of him and his companions, &s;o great a multitude of fi&s;hes were en|clo&s;ed, that they were obliged to call their partners to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>AMAZED at this miraculous draught of fi&s;hes, Simon Peter, in an extacy of admiration, blended with awe and humility, fell pro&s;trate it his Ma&s;ter's feet, acknowledging him|&s;elf a vile and &s;inful per&s;on, and thinking him&s;elf unworthy of being admitted into the pre&s;ence of a per&s;on &s;o immediately &s;ent from God: but the compa&s;&s;ionate Son of the Mo&s;t High kindly removed his fears, telling him that this miracle was wrought to confirm his faith, and to indicate to him, that the Almighty had appointed a more noble em|ployment for him, that of &s;aving the &s;ouls of the children of men. From this time Peter and his companions became the in&s;eparable and con&s;tant di&s;ciples of the great Me&s;&s;iah, living under the rules of his in&s;titutions and di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour returned &s;oon after to Capernaum with his di&s;ciples, where they found the mother-in-law of Peter dangerou&s;ly ill of a fever: but the compa&s;&s;ionate JESUS, who never omitted an opportunity of doing good to the human race, rebuked the di&s;ea&s;e, and taking her by the hand, re&s;tored her in a moment to her former health; demon&s;trating at once his power and willingne&s;s to relieve and comfort the &s;ons and daughters of affliction and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>THE adorable Redeemer, having for &s;ome time entered on his public mini&s;try, thought proper to elect &s;ome peculiar per&s;ons from among&s;t his followers, to be con&s;tant wit|ne&s;&s;es of his miracles and doctrines, and who after his departure, might be intru&s;ted with the care of building his church, and planting that religion in the world, for which he him&s;elf left the man&s;ions of heaven, and put on the veil of mortality. In order to this, he withdrew privately in the evening to a &s;olitary mountain, where he &s;pent the night in &s;olemn addre&s;&s;es to his Almighty Father, for rendering the great work he was going to undertake pro&s;perous and beneficial to mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="029927_0368_0FE33A01F9D5ADE8">THE di&s;ciples came to him early the next morning, out of whom he made choice of twelve to be his apo&s;tles, and the con&s;tant attendants on his per&s;on. The&s;e he after|wards inve&s;ted with the power of working miracles, and &s;ent them into different parts of Judea, in order to carry on with more rapidity the great work which he him&s;elf had &s;o happily begun among the people.</P>
<P>THE evangeli&s;ts in general, in their enumeration of the apo&s;tles, con&s;tantly place St. Peter fir&s;t. Indeed, the age and gravity of his per&s;on, together with his being fir&s;t called to be an apo&s;tle, particularly qualified him for being pre&s;ident of this &s;acred col|lege: but we mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e that St. Peter was inve&s;ted with any per&s;onal prerogative above his brethren; none of them ever intimated any &s;uch thing; and St. Paul &s;ays expre&s;sly, that he him&s;elf was not inferior to the very chiefe&s;t apo&s;tle; for he was not le&s;s eminent for u&s;efulne&s;s than &s;ucce&s;s in his mini&s;try.</P>
<P>THIS election had not long taken place, when the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, attended by Peter and the two &s;ons of Zebedee, followed Jairus, a ruler of the &s;ynagogue, to his hou&s;e, in order to re&s;tore his daughter, an only child, who lay on the point of death; but before their arrival, a me&s;&s;enger arrived with the news that the dam&s;el was dead, and therefore unnece&s;&s;ary for our Saviour to give him&s;elf any further trouble: but our Lord bid the ruler not di&s;pair; for, if he believed, his daughter &s;hould yet be re&s;tored to her former health: and accordingly, on his arrival he took the maid by the hand, and with the power of his word recalled her fleeting &s;pirit, which had quitted its earthly tabernacle, and re&s;tored her again to life and health, in the pre&s;ence of her a&s;toni&s;hed friends.</P>
<P>NO further account of St. Peter, in particular, occurs till the night after our Saviour's miraculou&s;ly feeding the multitude in the wilderne&s;s. JESUS had ordered his di&s;ciples to take &s;hip, and pa&s;s over to the other &s;ide, while he &s;ent the multitude away; but a vio|lent &s;torm ari&s;ing, they were in great danger of their lives, when their great Ma&s;ter came to them, walking on the &s;urface of the boi&s;terous billows, with the &s;ame ea&s;e as if it had been dry ground. At his approach, the di&s;ciples were greatly terrified, &s;uppo&s;ing they had &s;een a &s;pirit: but their compa&s;&s;ionate Ma&s;ter &s;oon di&s;pelled their fears, by telling them it was he him&s;elf, and therefore they had no rea&s;on to be terrified.</P>
<P>ST. PETER, who was always remarkable for bold re&s;olutions and precipitate zeal, de|&s;ired his Ma&s;ter to give him leave to come to him on the water; and on obtaining per|mi&s;&s;ion, he left the &s;hip, and walked on the &s;ea to meet his Saviour; but when he heard the deep roar about him, and the waves increa&s;e, he began to be afraid; and as his faith declined, his body &s;unk into the water; &s;o that, in the greate&s;t agony, he called for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to him who was able to &s;ave: nor was his cry in vain: the compa&s;&s;ionate Re|deemer of mankind &s;tretched out his hand, and again placed him on the &s;urface of the water, with this gentle reproof, <HI>O thou of little faith, wherefore did&s;t thou doubt?</HI> And no &s;ooner was the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS and his di&s;ciple entered into the &s;hip, than the winds cea&s;ed, the waves &s;ub&s;ided, and the &s;hip was at the land whither they were going. A miracle of this kind could not fail of a&s;toni&s;hing the di&s;ciples, and convincing them of the divinity of his per&s;on; accordingly, they drew near, and wor&s;hipped him with this confe&s;&s;ion, <HI>of a truth thou art the Son of God</HI></P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, the next day, entered the &s;ynagogue of Capernaum; and, from the miracle of the loaves, took occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e concerning him&s;elf, as the true manna, and the <HI>bread which came down from heaven:</HI> opening to them the more &s;ublime and &s;piritual my&s;teries, and the nece&s;&s;ary and important duties of the go&s;pel. On which, great part of the audience, who expected he was going to erect a temporal king|dom, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h the throne of David in Jeru&s;alem, offended at his repre&s;enting

his dominions as entirely &s;piritual, departed from him, and came no more to hear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;cour&s;es. JESUS, on beholding this defection, turned him&s;elf towards his di&s;ciples, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;ked them whether they al&s;o would go away? To which Peter replied, <HI>Lord, whither &s;hall we go? thou ha&s;t the words of eternal life:</HI> thy doctrine alone can in&s;truct us in the paths that lead to happine&s;s; and thou art the true Me&s;&s;iah, the great Prophet &s;o fully fore|told and &s;o long expected by our nation.</P>
<P>OUR great Redeemer being willing to hear what account his di&s;ciples would give him of the various opinions of the people, a&s;ked them what the world &s;aid concerning him? To which they replied, that &s;ome took him for John the Bapti&s;t ri&s;en from the dead; &s;ome thought him to be Elias, and others Jeremiah, or one of the old prophets. This account not &s;atisfying our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, he told them that it was no wonder that the people, who had &s;eldom &s;een him, &s;hould form various conjectures concerning him and the doctrine he preached; but as they had been con&s;tantly with him, heard his &s;ermons, and been &s;pectators of his miracles, it was natural to think they might form a truer idea of him; and, therefore, a&s;ked them what they them&s;elves thought of him? To which Peter in the name of the re&s;t, an&s;wered, <HI>Thou art Chri&s;t, Son of the living God,</HI> anointed and &s;et apart by the Mo&s;t High, to be the great King, Prie&s;t, and Prophet of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>THIS full and comprehen&s;ive declaration of Peter, &s;atisfied the enquiry of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who an&s;wered, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed art thou Simon Bar-Jonah; for fle&s;h and blood hath not re|vealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven:</HI> that is, this faith which thou ha&s;t now confe&s;&s;ed, is not human, or built upon the te&s;timony of man, but upon tho&s;e evidences and principles which I was &s;ent from God to reveal unto the world, and tho&s;e great and &s;o|lemn atte&s;tations he hath given from heaven to the truth both of my per&s;on and doctrine: therefore, <HI>I &s;ay unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it.</HI> As thy name &s;ignifies a rock, &s;o &s;halt thou prove firm, &s;olid, and immovable, in building my church, which &s;hall be &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed by thy care and diligence to that faith thou ha&s;t now profe&s;&s;ed, and all the a&s;&s;aults of men and devils &s;hall not be able to de&s;troy, by their utmo&s;t efforts.</P>
<P>AT this time the di&s;ciples had no idea that their Ma&s;ter was to &s;uffer death for the &s;ins of the world; on the contrary, they con&s;idered him as immortal, having imbibed the opinion of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, <HI>That Chri&s;t abideth forever:</HI> &s;o that when the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS told them of the &s;ufferings he mu&s;t undergo at Jeru&s;alem, what affronts and indig|nities he mu&s;t &s;uffer, and be at la&s;t put to death with all the effects of torture and di&s;grace, by a &s;entence of the Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim, St. Peter, who could not endure the thought of his Ma&s;ter's &s;uffering even the lea&s;t puni&s;hment, much le&s;s tho&s;e cruelties he had men|tioned, and at la&s;t death it&s;elf, interrupted him very un&s;ea&s;onably, and &s;aid, <HI>Be it far from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, Lord; this &s;hall not be unto thee.</HI> He con&s;idered the&s;e &s;ufferings as incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of the great Me&s;&s;iah, whom he expected would re&s;tore the &s;plendour of the throne of David his father, and reduce all the kingdoms of the earth to his obedience.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who came down from heaven to give his life a ran&s;om for the &s;ins of the world, and who valued the redemption of mankind infinitely more than his own ea&s;e and &s;afety, highly re&s;ented this &s;peech of St. Peter, and accordingly returned this &s;harp reproof, <HI>Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offence to me; thou favoure&s;t not the things of God, but tho&s;e that be of men.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e tran&s;actions, the great Redeemer of the &s;ons of men, being about to re|ceive a &s;pecimen of his future glorification, took with him three of the mo&s;t intimate of his apo&s;tles, Peter and the two &s;ons of Zebedee, and went up into a very high mountain, and while they were employed in earne&s;t addre&s;&s;es to the Almighty, he was transfigured

<P>ST. PETER and the two apo&s;tles were in the mean time fallen a&s;leep, being either weary for want of natural re&s;t; or, overpowered with the&s;e extraordinary appearances, which the frailty and weakne&s;s of their nature could not &s;upport, were fallen into a trance: but on their awaking, were &s;trangely &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee their Lord &s;urrounded with &s;o much glory, and tho&s;e two great per&s;ons conver&s;ing wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h him. They however, remained &s;ilent till tho&s;e vi&s;itants from the courts of heaven were going to depart, when Peter, in a rapture and extacy of mind, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his Ma&s;ter, declaring their infinite plea&s;ure and delight in being favoured with this glorious &s;pectacle; and de&s;ired his leave to erect three tabernacles, one for him, one for Mo&s;es, and one for Elias; but while he was &s;peaking, a bright cloud &s;uddenly over&s;haded tho&s;e two great prophets, and a voice came from it, uttering the&s;e remarkable words, <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed; hear ye him.</HI> On which the apo&s;tles were &s;eized with the utmo&s;t con&s;ter|nation, and fell upon their faces to the ground; but JESUS touching them, bid them di&s;mi&s;s their fears and look up with confidence. They immediately obeyed, but &s;aw their Ma&s;ter only; the others having vani&s;hed, together with the cloud of light they had lately beheld.</P>
<P>THIS heavenly &s;cene being ended, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour travelled through Galilee with his apo&s;tles, and at his return to Capernaum, the tax-gatherers came to Peter, and a&s;ked him, whether his Ma&s;ter was not obliged to pay tribute. To which Peter readily de|clared he did. On his entering the hou&s;e to give his Ma&s;ter an account of this demand, JESUS prevented him, by a&s;king, <HI>What thinke&s;t thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take cu&s;tom or tribute? of their own children, or of &s;trangers?</HI> To which Peter an&s;wered, not from their &s;ervants and family, but from &s;trangers. <HI>Then,</HI> replied our Lord, <HI>are the children free.</HI> I my&s;elf as being the Son of God, and you as my &s;er|vants, are free from this tax, yearly paid to God, for repairing his temple at Jeru&s;alem. But rather than give offence, by &s;eeming to de&s;pi&s;e the hou&s;e of God, and undervalue that authority which had &s;ettled this tribute, he determined to pay it, though at the expence of a miracle. Accordingly, he ordered Peter to repair to the &s;ea with a hook, and take the fir&s;t fi&s;h that offered, in who&s;e mouth he &s;hould find a piece of money. The di&s;ciple obeyed, and found the money as his Ma&s;ter had foretold, and gave to the gatherers of the tribute for his Ma&s;ter and him&s;elf, as their proportion of it.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour having entered the city of Jeru&s;alem in triumph, he repaired to Bethany; from whence he &s;ent two of his di&s;ciples, Peter and John, to make preparation for his celebrating the pa&s;&s;over before his death.</P>
<P>PREPARATION being made, the great Redeemer and his apo&s;tles entered the hou&s;e, and &s;et down at table. But their great Ma&s;ter, who often taught them by example as well as precept, aro&s;e from his &s;eat, laid a&s;ide his upper garment, took a towel, and pouring water into a ba&s;on, began to wa&s;h his di&s;ciples' feet, to teach them humility and charity by his own example. But on his coming to Peter, he would by no means admit his Ma&s;ter to perform &s;o mean and conde&s;cending an office. What! the Son of God
<PB N="350" REF="029927_0371_0FE33A109CA0A0E8">
&s;toop to wa&s;h the feet of a &s;inful mortel! A thought which &s;hocked the apo&s;tle, who &s;trenuou&s;ly declared, <HI>Thou &s;halt never wa&s;h my feet.</HI> But the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS told him, that if he wa&s;hed him not, he could have no part with him; meaning that this action was my&s;tical, and &s;ignified the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and the purifying virtue of the &s;pirit of the Mo&s;t High, to be poured upon all true Chri&s;tians. This an&s;wer &s;ufficiently removed the &s;cruples of Peter, who cried out, <HI>Lord, not my feet only, but al&s;o my hands and my head.</HI></P>
<P>THE dear Redeemer now began the in&s;titution of his &s;upper, that great and &s;olemn in&s;titution, which he re&s;olved to leave behind him, to be con&s;tantly celebrated in his church, as a &s;tanding monument and memorial of his love in dying for mankind; telling them at the &s;ame time, that he him&s;elf was now going to leave them, and that whither he went, they could not come. Peter, not well under&s;tanding what he meant, a&s;ked him whither he was going? To which our ble&s;&s;ed Lord replied, that he was going to that place, whither he could not now, but &s;hould hereafter follow him; intimating the mar|tyrdom he was to &s;uffer for his Ma&s;ter's religion. Peter an&s;wered, that he was ready to follow him, even if it required him to lay down his life. This confident pre&s;umption was not at all agreeable to the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, who told him he had promi&s;ed great things, but would be &s;o far from performing them, that before the cock crew twice, that is before three in the morning, he would deny his Ma&s;ter thrice.</P>
<P>HAVING now ended &s;upper, they &s;ung an hymn, and departed to the Mount of Olives; where JESUS again put them in mind how greatly the things he was going to &s;uffer would offend them. To which Peter replied, that <HI>though all men &s;hall be offended becau&s;e of thee, yet will I never be offended.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this they repaired to the garden of Geth&s;emane; and leaving the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles near the entrance, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, taking with him Peter, James, and John, retired into the more &s;olitary parts of the garden, to enter on the preparatory &s;cene of the great tragedy that was now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igh at hand.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS at this awful juncture laboured under the bittere&s;t agony that human nature &s;uffered, during which he prayed with the utmo&s;t fervency to his almighty Fa|ther, <HI>offering up prayers and &s;upplications, with &s;trong cryings and tears; and his &s;weat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</HI> While our great Redeemer was thus interceding with the Almighty, his three di&s;ciples were fallen a&s;leep, though he had made three &s;everal vi&s;its to them; calling to Peter, a&s;ked him, if he could not watch one hour with him? advi&s;ing them all to watch and pray, that they might not enter into temptation, adding, <HI>The &s;pirit indeed is willing, but the fle&s;h is weak.</HI></P>
<P>DURING our Lord's conver&s;ation with them, a band of &s;oldiers from the chief prie&s;ts and elders, preceeded by the traitor Judas to conduct and direct them, ru&s;hed into the garden, and &s;eized the great High-Prie&s;t of our profe&s;&s;ion. Peter, who&s;e ungovernable zeal would admit of no re&s;taint, drew his &s;word, and, without the lea&s;t order from his Ma&s;ter, &s;truck at one of the per&s;ons who &s;eemed to be remarkably bu&s;y in binding JESUS, and cut off his right ear. This wild and unwarrantable zeal was very offen&s;ive to his Ma&s;ter, who rebuked Peter, and entreated the patience of the &s;oldiers, while he healed the wound by a miracle.</P>
<P>THE fidelity of the apo&s;tles, which they had urged with &s;o much confidence, was now put to the trial. They &s;aw their Ma&s;ter in the hands of a rude and incon&s;iderate band of men; and therefore &s;hould have exerted their power to relea&s;e him, or at lea&s;t have been the companions of his &s;ufferings, and endeavoured, by every kind and endearing action, to have le&s;&s;ened his grief. But, alas! in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting or comfort|ing their Ma&s;ter, they all for&s;ook him and fled,&mdash;from innocence in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="029927_0372_0FE33A122135A5E0">HEREUPON the &s;oldiers who had bound JESUS led him away, delivered him to the chief prie&s;ts and elders, who carried him from one tribunal to another; fir&s;t to Annas, and then to Caiaphas, where the Jewe&s;h Sanhedrim were a&s;&s;embled, in order to try and condemn him to death.</P>
<P>PETER, who in the mean time had followed the other di&s;ciples in their flight, re|covered his &s;pirits, and encouraged by his companion St. John, returned to &s;eek his Ma&s;ter; and &s;eeing him leading to the high-prie&s;t's hall followed at a di&s;tance, to know the event: but on his coming to the door he was refu&s;ed admittance, till one of the di&s;ciples probably St. John, who was acquainted there, came out, and prevailed on the &s;ervant who kept the door to let him in. Peter being admitted, repaired to the fire burning in the middle of the hall, round which the officers and &s;ervants were &s;tanding; where being ob&s;erved by the maid-&s;ervant who let him in, &s;he charged him with being one of CHRIST's di&s;ciples; but Peter publickly denied the charge, declaring that he did not know him, and pre&s;ently withdrew into a porch, where he heard the cock crow: an intimation &s;eemingly &s;ufficient to have awakened his con&s;cience into a quick &s;ence of his duty, and the promi&s;e he had a few hours before made to his Ma&s;ter. But, alas! human nature when left to it&s;elf, is remarkably frail and incon&s;tant. This Peter &s;uf|ficiently experienced; for while he continued in the porch, another maid met him, and charged him with being one of the followers of JESUS of Nazareth; which Peter &s;tiffly denied, and, the better to gain belief, uttered an oath, to confirm his a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>NEARLY an hour after this, the &s;ervant of the high-prie&s;t (he who&s;e ear Peter had cut off) charged him with being a di&s;ciple of CHRIST, and that he him&s;elf had &s;een him in the garden with him; adding, that his very &s;peech proved him to be a Galilean. Peter, however, &s;till denied the fact; and to add the highe&s;t accompli&s;hment to his &s;ins, ratified it, not only by an oath, but a &s;olemn cur&s;e and execration, that he was not the per&s;on, that he knew not the man. But no &s;ooner had he uttered this denial, than the cock crew. At which his ma&s;ter turned about, and earne&s;tly looked upon him: a look that pierced him to the heart, and brought to his remembrance what his Saviour more than once foretold, that he would ba&s;ely and &s;hamefully deny him. Peter was now no longer able to contain his &s;orrow; he fled from the palace of the high-prie&s;t, and wept bitterly, pa&s;&s;ionately bewailing his folly, and the aggrevations of his &s;in; endeavouring thereby to make &s;ome reparation for his apo&s;tacy, and recover the the favour of heaven, and prevent the execution of divine ju&s;tice, by taking a &s;evere revenge upon him&s;elf for his crime.</P>
<P>ST. PETER's fall &s;hould convince us of the mi&s;erable frailty even of the be&s;t of men, and effectually &s;ubdue tho&s;e vain confidences which are apt to ri&s;e in our hearts from our own &s;uppo&s;ed &s;trength and virtue; for as this great di&s;ciple fell in &s;o &s;candalous a manner, we &s;hall hereafter care to depend upon the highe&s;t degree of knowledge, when one &s;o wi&s;e, &s;o perfectly &s;atisfied of the truth of the Chri&s;tian doctrine, was after the fulle&s;t convictions of his own con&s;cience, &s;o weak and frail as to deny and abjure his Lord who in&s;tructed and bought him, even at the price of his own blood? Who &s;hall pre&s;ume upon his be&s;t re&s;olutions, when he who declared &s;o firm a purpo&s;e of adhearing to JESUS, did within a few hours peremptorily and &s;olemnly di&s;own that very per&s;on for who&s;e &s;ake he was lately ready and di&s;po&s;ed to lay down his life.</P>
<P>FROM this example we &s;hould al&s;o remember the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the Almigh|ty, in cau&s;ing the faults and infirmities of his faints to be recorded in the Holy &s;crip|tures, and the u&s;e we ought to make of their failings and temptations. Their eminent virtues, and their as eminent repentance where they did ami&s;s, are written as a &s;ea|&s;onable
<PB N="352" REF="029927_0373_0FE33A13E375DD98">
warning, and exhibit an in&s;tance of humiliation to all future ages; by letting us &s;ee, that the mo&s;t perfect are but men, &s;ubject to blemi&s;hes and imperfections: and that the highe&s;t and pure&s;t &s;tate is no &s;ecurity from danger. This &s;hould make us very ten|der how we judge and di&s;pi&s;e our brethern; who&s;e faults, however &s;everely we may cen|&s;ure them, might probably have been our own had we been in their circum&s;tances and &s;urrounded with their temptations: for <HI>let him that thinketh he &s;tandeth, take heed le&s;t he fall.</HI> We &s;hould not then promi&s;e our&s;elves &s;afety and freedom from temptations in any circum&s;tances in life; or &s;o far pre&s;ume on our own virtue, as to think we are incapa|ble of committing the blacke&s;t crimes, &s;hould the Almighty withdraw his grace, and leave us to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>WE have no account whether St. Peter, after the denial of his Ma&s;ter, retired into &s;ome &s;olitary place to give vent to his grief and indulge his tears: or whether he fol|lowed his Saviour through the &s;everal &s;tages of his trial, and per&s;onally attended as a mourner at the funeral of his Ma&s;ter. But however that be, he &s;taid at Jeru&s;alem, or, at lea&s;t, in the neighbourhood, and probably with St. John; for when Mary Magda|lene returned from the &s;epulchre, to inform the di&s;ciples that the &s;tone was rolled away from the door, and the body not to be found, Peter and John &s;et out immediately to|wards the garden. John who was the younger arrived fir&s;t at the &s;epulchre, looked into it, but did not enter, either out of fear, or a reverence to his Saviour.</P>
<P>PETER, who&s;e zeal was greatly increa&s;ed, came &s;oon after, and re&s;olutely went into the &s;epulchre where he found the linen cloths lying together in one place, the napkin that was about his head wrapped together in another; a &s;ufficient indication that the body was not &s;tolen away: for had that been the ca&s;e &s;o much care and order would not have been ob&s;erved in di&s;po&s;ing of the linen cloths. But he did not wait long in &s;u&s;pence with regard to his great Lord and Ma&s;ter; for the &s;ame day, and probably about noon, JESUS appeared to him; perhaps in compa&s;&s;ion to his &s;orrow, in which he was overwhelmed for his late &s;hameful denial of his Ma&s;ter. And as he was the fir&s;t of the di&s;ciples who had made a &s;ignal confe&s;&s;ion of the divinity of the Me&s;&s;iah, &s;o it was rea&s;onable he &s;hould fir&s;t &s;ee him after his re&s;urerction; and, at the &s;ame time to con|vince him that the crime he had been guilty of in denying him was pardoned, and that he was come, like the good Samaritan, to pour oil into his wounded con&s;cience, and admini&s;ter comfort to his afflicted &s;oul.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tles &s;oon after prepared to obey the command of their great Ma&s;ter, of retiring into Galilee; and we find that Peter, Nathaniel, the two &s;ons of Zebedee, and two other di&s;ciples, returned to their old trade of fi&s;hing on the lake. One morning early, as they were labouring at their employment, having &s;pent the whole night to no purpo&s;e, they &s;aw on the &s;hore a grave per&s;on (perhaps in the habit of a traveller) who called to them, and a&s;ked if they had any meat? To which they an&s;wered No. Ca&s;t then, replied he, the net on the right &s;ide of the &s;hip, and ye &s;hall find. They followed his directions, and enclo&s;ed a prodigious number of large fi&s;h. A&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch remarkable &s;ucce&s;s, the di&s;ciples looked one upon another for &s;ome time, till St. John told Peter, that the per&s;on on the &s;hore, was doubtle&s;s their great Lord and Ma&s;ter, whom the winds, the &s;ea, and the inhabitants of the watery region, were &s;o ready to yield obedience to.</P>
<P>ST. PETER no &s;ooner heard the beloved di&s;ciple declare his opinion, concerning the &s;tranger, than his zeal took fire, and, notwith&s;tanding the coolne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, girt on his fi&s;her's coat, threw him&s;elf into the &s;ea, and &s;wam to &s;hore; his impatience to be with his Lord and Ma&s;ter, not &s;uffering him to &s;tay the few minutes nece&s;&s;ary to bring the &s;hip to the &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="029927_0374_0FE33A1C59896250">AS &s;oon as the di&s;ciples came on land, they found a fire kindled, and fi&s;h laid upon it, either immediately created by the power of their divine Ma&s;ter, or that came a&s;hore of its own accord, and offered it&s;elf to his hand: but notwith&s;tanding there were fi&s;h already on the fire, he ordered them to bring of tho&s;e they had now caught, and dre&s;s them for their repa&s;t, he him&s;elf eating with them; both to give them an in&s;tance of mutual love and friend&s;hip, and al&s;o to a&s;&s;ure them of the truth of his human nature, &s;ince he was ri&s;en from the dead, as they now beheld.</P>
<P>THE repa&s;t being ended, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf particularly to St. Peter, urging him to the utmo&s;t diligence in his care of &s;ouls; and becau&s;e he knew that no|thing but a &s;incere love to him&s;elf could &s;upport him under the troubles and dangers of &s;o laborious and difficult an employment, he inquired of him whether he loved him more than the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles; mildly reproving him for his over-confident re&s;olution. Peter, whom fatal experience had taught humility, mode&s;tly an&s;wered, that none knew &s;o well as him&s;elf the integrity of his affections; thou knowe&s;t the hearts of all men, nothing is hid from thee, and therefore thou knowe&s;t that I love thee. The que&s;tion was three &s;everal times repeated by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and as many times an&s;wered by the apo&s;tle: it being but ju&s;t that he, who by a threefold denial, had given &s;o much rea&s;on to que&s;tion his affection, &s;hould now, by a threefold confe&s;&s;ion, give more than common a&s;&s;urance of his &s;incere love for his Ma&s;ter; and to each of the&s;e confe&s;&s;ions, our great Redeemer added this &s;ignal trial of his affection, <HI>Feed my &s;heep.</HI></P>
<P>OUR dear Lord having thus engaged Peter to a cheerful compliance with dangers that might attend the di&s;charge of his office, particularly intimated to him the fate that would attend him; telling him, that when he was young, he girt him&s;elf, lived at his plea&s;ure, and went wherever his fancy directed him; but when he &s;hould reach the term of old age, he &s;hould &s;tretch forth his hands, and another &s;hould gird him, and bind him, and lead him, whither he had no de&s;ire to go; intimating, as the evangeli&s;ts tell us, by what death he &s;hould glorify God, and &s;eal the truth with his blood.</P>
<P>ST. PETER was not aver&s;e to drinking the bitter cup, and making his confe&s;&s;ion as public as his denial, that he might thereby te&s;tify the &s;incerity of his &s;orrow, and con|trition for his great offence. And &s;eeing John following, he a&s;ked his great Ma&s;ter what &s;hould be his fate, and whether he, who had been the object of his Ma&s;ter's love in his life-time, &s;hould not have as honourable a death as he that had denied him? To which JESUS replied, it doth not concern thee to know how I &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of events with regard to him; he &s;hall &s;ee the de&s;truction of the Jewi&s;h nation, and then go down in peace to the chambers of the du&s;t.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;oon after appeared to his di&s;ciples at Jeru&s;alem, and take his la&s;t farewell of them, who had con&s;tantly attended him during his mini&s;try among&s;t the &s;ons of men. He now led them out as far as Bethany; a &s;mall village on Mount Olivet, where he briefly told them, that they were the per&s;ons he had cho&s;en to be the witne&s;&s;es both of his death and re&s;urrection; a te&s;timony which they &s;hould publi&s;h in every part of the world: in order to which, he would, after his a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven, pour out his &s;pirit upon them in an extraordinary manner, that they might be the better enabled to &s;truggle with that violent rage and fury with which the doctrine of the go&s;pel would be oppo&s;ed by men and devils; adding, that in the mean time they &s;hould return to Jeru&s;alem, and there wait till tho&s;e miraculous powers were given from on high. This di&s;cour&s;e being fini&s;hed, he laid hands upon them, and gave them his &s;olemn benediction; during which he was taken from them, and received up unto the regions of the heavenly Canaan.</P>

The fir&s;t object that engaged their attention after their return to Jeru&s;alem, was to fill up the vacancy in their college, lately made by the unhappy fall and apo&s;tacy of Judas. In order to this they called together the church, and entered into an upper room, where Peter, as pre&s;ident of the a&s;&s;embly, propo&s;ed to them the choice of a new apo&s;tle. He put them in mind that Judas, one of the di&s;ciples of their great and beloved Ma&s;ter, being betrayed by his covetous and in&s;atiable temper, had lately fallen from the honour of his place and mini&s;try; that this was no more than what the prophet had long &s;ince foretold &s;hould come to pa&s;s; and that the care of the church which had been committed to him, &s;hould devolve upon another; that therefore it was highly nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome per&s;on who had been familiarly conver&s;ant with the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, and con&s;equently, a competent witne&s;s both of his doctrine and miracles, his death, re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion, &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted in his room, and appointed to that high office. In order to which, two candidates were propo&s;ed, Jo&s;eph, called Bar&s;abas, and Matthias, both qualified for the great and important office of the apo&s;tle&s;hip; and having prayed that the Divine Providence would immediately guide and direct their choice, they ca&s;t lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, who was accordingly admitted into the number of the twelve apo&s;tles of our Lord.</P>
<P>THIS vacancy being filled up in the apo&s;tolic college, they &s;pent their time in prayer and meditation, till the fea&s;t of Penteco&s;t; when the promi&s;e of their great Ma&s;ter in &s;ending the Holy Gho&s;t was fulfilled. The Chri&s;tian a&s;&s;embly were met as u&s;ual, to perform the public &s;ervices of their wor&s;hip, when &s;uddenly a &s;ound, like that of a mighty wind, ru&s;hed in upon them, repre&s;enting the powerful efficacy of that Divine Spirit which was now to be communicated to them; after which there appeared &s;mall flames of fire, which, in the &s;hape of cloven tongues, de&s;cended, and &s;at upon the head of each of them, to denote that their enjoyment of this gift &s;hould be con&s;tant and perpetual, and not like the prophets of old, who were in&s;pired only at &s;ome particular times and &s;ea&s;ons: upon which they were all filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, which, in an in&s;tant, enabled them to &s;peak fluently &s;everal languages they had never learned, and probably never heard till this time.</P>
<P>AS this &s;urpri&s;ing tran&s;action had different effects on the minds of the audience, &s;ome con&s;idering it as the effect of a miracle, and others to the power and &s;trength of new wine; the apo&s;tles thereupon all &s;tood up, and Peter, in the name of the re&s;t, under|took to confute this injurious calumny: he told them that this &s;candalous &s;lander pro|ceeded from the &s;pirit of malice and fal&s;ehood; that their cen&s;ure was as uncharitable as it was unju&s;t; that it was early in the morning, and therefore not a time for drinking, e&s;pecially on a day &s;et apart for devotion; that the&s;e extraordinary and miraculous effects were but the accompli&s;hment of an ancient prophecy, which the Almighty had expre&s;sly declared &s;hould be fulfilled in the times of the Me&s;&s;iah; that JESUS of Nazareth had evidently proved him&s;elf to be that great prophet, the Son of the Mo&s;t High, by many unque&s;tionable miracles, of which they them&s;elves had been eye-witne&s;&s;es; and though, by the permi&s;&s;ion of Omnipotence, who had determined by this means, to bring about the redemption of mankind, they had wickedly crucified and &s;lain him, yet God had rai&s;ed him from the dead.</P>
<P>THOUGH this was the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e that St. Peter ever made in public, it deeply af|fected the audience, and every word, like a dagger, pierced them to the heart; &s;o that they cried out, <HI>Men and Brethren, what &s;hall we do?</HI> To which Peter an&s;wered, "The
<PB N="355" REF="029927_0376_0FE33A206AE47FD0">
only way to expiate your guilt, and obtain pardon for the &s;ins you have committed, and acquire the gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, is to repent &s;incerely, and be baptized into the religion of this crucified Saviour."</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after this wonderful conver&s;ation, Peter and John going up to the tem|ple about three in the afternoon, near the conclu&s;ion of one of the &s;olemn hours of prayer, they &s;aw a poor impotent cripple near forty years of age, who had been lame from his birth, lying at the beautiful gate of the temple, and a&s;king alms of tho&s;e who entered the &s;acred edifice. This mi&s;erable object moved their compa&s;&s;ion; and Peter beholding him with attention, &s;aid, "The riches of this world, the &s;ilver and gold &s;o highly coveted by the &s;ons of men, are not in my power to be&s;tow; but I po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of re&s;toring life and health, and am ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t thee." Then taking the man by the hand, commanded him in the name of JESUS of Nazareth to ri&s;e up and walk. Immediately the nerves and &s;inews were enlarged, and the &s;everal parts of the di&s;ea&s;ed members performed their natural tran&s;actions: upon which the man accompanied them into the temple, walking, leaping, and prai&s;ing God for his cure.</P>
<P>AN event &s;o &s;trange and extraordinary, filled the minds of the people with admira|tion, and their curio&s;ity drew them round the apo&s;tles to view the men who had per|formed it. Peter, &s;eeing the multitude gathering round them took the opportunity of &s;peaking to them in the following manner: "Men and brethren, this remarkable cure &s;hould not excite your admiration of us, as if we had performed it by our own power; it was wrought in the name of JESUS of Nazareth, our crucified Ma&s;ter, by the power of that very CHRIST, that holy and ju&s;t Per&s;on, whom you your&s;elves denied, and de|livered to Pilate, nay, and preferred a murderer before him, when the governor was de&s;irous of letting him go: but though you have put him to death, yet we are wit|ne&s;&s;es that he hath rai&s;ed him again from the dead, and that he is a&s;cended into heaven, where he will remain till the great and tremendous day of general re&s;titution."</P>
<P>WHILE Peter was &s;peaking to the people in one part of the temple, John was, in all probability, doing the &s;ame in the other: and the &s;ucce&s;s plainly indicated how powerfully the preaching of the apo&s;tles was; five thou&s;and per&s;ons embracing the doctrine of the go&s;pel, and acknowledging the crucified JESUS for their Lord and Redeemer.</P>
<P>THE attention and envy of the rulers of I&s;rael could not fail of being excited at &s;uch amazing &s;ucce&s;s from the preaching of the apo&s;tles; accordingly, the prie&s;ts and Sad|ducees repaired to the Roman magi&s;trate, and intimated to him, that, in all probability, this concour&s;e of people would prove the cau&s;e of a tumult and in&s;urrection. Upon this information, the captain of the temple &s;eized on the apo&s;tles, and ca&s;t them into pri&s;on. The next day they were carried before the Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim: and being a&s;ked by what power and authority they had done this, Peter boldly an&s;wered, "Be it known unto you and to all the de&s;cendants of Jacob, that this miracle was wrought wholly in the name of JESUS of Nazareth, whom ye your&s;elves have crucified and &s;lain, and whom the Al|mighty hath rai&s;ed again from the dead. This is the &s;tone which you builders refu&s;ed, and which is become the head of the corner: nor is there any other way by which you, or any of the &s;ons of men can be &s;aved, but by this crucified Saviour, the Lord JESUS CHRIST."</P>
<P>AFTER beholding the apo&s;tles with a kind of a&s;toni&s;hment, the court remembered that they had &s;een them with JESUS of Nazareth, and therefore ordered them to with|draw, whil&s;t they debated among&s;t them&s;elves what was proper to be done: it was im|po&s;&s;ible to deny the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acle, for it was performed before all the people, and the per&s;on on whom it was wrought, no &s;tranger in Jeru&s;alem. They therefore re&s;olved to charge
<PB N="356" REF="029927_0377_0FE33A21F14B5E98">
them &s;trictly not to preach any more in the name of JESUS: accordingly, they were again called in, and acquainted with the re&s;olution of the council: to which the apo&s;tles an&s;wered, "That as they had received a commi&s;&s;ion from heaven, to declare to all na|tions what they had &s;een and heard, it was certainly their duty to obey God rather than man."</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH this was a fair appeal to the con&s;ciences of their very judges; yet the&s;e rulers of I&s;rael, in&s;tead of being &s;atisfied with it, would in all probability have proceed|ed to a greater violence, had not the peoples' veneration for the apo&s;tles checked their malice; &s;o that all they dared to do, was to enforce their menaces, and &s;uffer them to depart.</P>
<P>THIS intrepidity of the apo&s;tles had the de&s;ired effect; the church increa&s;ed exceed|ingly: and that &s;o great a company, e&s;pecially the poor and needy, might be maintained, the profe&s;&s;ors of the religion of the holy JESUS &s;old their e&s;tates, and brought the money to the apo&s;tles, that they might depo&s;it it in one common trea&s;ury, and from thence &s;up|ply the &s;everal exigences of their poor brethren.</P>
<P>WE find, however, that hypocri&s;y was not unknown among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of reli|gion, even in the&s;e primitive times. Ananias and his wife Sapphira, having embraced the doctrine of the go&s;pel, pretended to follow the free and generous &s;pirit of the&s;e times, by con&s;ecrating and devoting their e&s;tate to the honour of God, and the nece&s;&s;i|ties of the church. Accordingly, they &s;old their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and brought part of the money and laid it at the apo&s;tles' feet; hoping to deceive them, though guided by the &s;pirit of Omnipotence: but Peter, at his fir&s;t coming in, a&s;ked Ananias how he could &s;uffer Satan to fill his heart with &s;uch enormous wickedne&s;s, as to think to deceive the Holy Gho&s;t? That before it was &s;old, it was wholly in his own power; and afterwards the money entirely at his own di&s;po&s;al: &s;o that this action was capable of no other in|terpretation, than that he had not only abu&s;ed and injured man, but mocked the Almighty him&s;elf, who he mu&s;t know was privy to the mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts of his heart.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner had the apo&s;tles fini&s;hed, than Ananias, to the great terror of all that were pre&s;ent, fell down dead by a &s;troke from heaven; and not long after his wife came in, whom Peter reproved in the &s;ame manner he had done her hu&s;band, adding, that &s;he &s;hould immediately end her life in the &s;ame awful manner; upon which &s;he was &s;mitten by the hand of Omnipotence, and fell down dead; &s;haring with her hu&s;band in the pu|ni&s;hment, as &s;he had before in the heinous crime.</P>
<P>THIS remarkable in&s;tance of &s;everity, filled all the converts with fear and trembling, and prevented in a great mea&s;ure, that hypocri&s;y and di&s;&s;imulation, by which others might flatter them&s;elves to deceive the church. But &s;uch in&s;tances of &s;everity were very ex|traordinary; the power of the apo&s;tles was generally exerted in works of mercy and be|neficence towards the &s;ons and daughters of affliction: they cured all kinds of di&s;ea&s;es, and ca&s;t out devils; &s;o that they brought the &s;ick into the &s;treets, and laid them on beds and couches, that the &s;hadow, at lea&s;t of Peter as he pa&s;&s;ed by, might cover &s;ome of them&punc; well knowing, a &s;ingle touch or word from either of the apo&s;tles was &s;ufficient to remove a di&s;ea&s;e of the mo&s;t inveterate nature.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the&s;e &s;tupendous works of the apo&s;tles, and the growing numbers of the church alarmed the rulers of I&s;rael, who &s;eized the apo&s;tles and ca&s;t them into pri&s;on. Their power, however, was limited, and like the drop of a bucket to the ocean, when oppo&s;ed to the Almighty arm of the great Jehovah. The pri&s;on doors, though fa&s;tened
<PB N="357" REF="029927_0378_0FE33A2CE2345900">
with the utmo&s;t caution, opened of them&s;elves at the approach of a me&s;&s;enger from the court of heaven, who commanded the apo&s;tles to leave the dungeon, repair to the temple, and preach the glad-tidings of the go&s;pel to the people in Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>WHEN the officers returned in the morning, they found the pri&s;on doors &s;hut and guarded, but the pri&s;oners gone. This remarkable circum&s;tance greatly alarmed them, and they repaired to the council to acquaint them with what had happened. The rulers were a&s;toni&s;hed at the news; but hearing that the apo&s;tles were teaching in the temple, they &s;ent an officer to bring them, without the lea&s;t violence to their per&s;ons, before the Sanhedrim. Their orders were &s;oon obeyed, and the di&s;ciples of JESUS placed before the &s;ame court, by which their Ma&s;ter had been &s;o lately condemned.</P>
<P>BEING thus brought before the Sanhedrim, the high-prie&s;t a&s;ked the apo&s;tles how they dared to propagate a doctrine they had lately &s;o &s;trictly charged them not to preach: to which Peter, in the name of the re&s;t replied, "We certainly ought to obey God rather than man; and though you have &s;o barbarou&s;ly and contumeliou&s;ly treated the Saviour of the world, yet God hath rai&s;ed him up to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give both repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins: and of the&s;e things both we are witne&s;&s;es, together with the miraculous powers which the Holy Gho&s;t hath conferred on all Chri&s;tians."</P>
<P>AS the apo&s;tles delivered this an&s;wer with remarkable boldne&s;s, it exa&s;perated the council, and they began to con&s;ult how they might de&s;troy them: but Gamaliel, a grave and learned coun&s;ellor, after commanding the apo&s;tles to withdraw, de&s;ired them to proceed with caution in an affair of this nature; reminding them, that &s;everal per&s;ons had already rai&s;ed parties, and drawn great numbers of per&s;ons after them; but that every one of them had mi&s;carried, and all their de&s;igns were rendered abortive without the in|terpo&s;ition of that court. That they would therefore do well to let the apo&s;tles alone; for if their doctrines and de&s;igns were of human invention, they would come to nothing; but if they were of God, all their powers and policy would be of no effect.</P>
<P>THE council were &s;atisfied with this prudent and rational advice, and after commanding the apo&s;tles to be &s;courged, they &s;trictly charged them to preach no more in the name of JESUS, and &s;et them at liberty: but this charge had little effect on the di&s;ciples of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS; they returned home in triumph, rejoicing that they were thought worthy to &s;uffer in &s;o righteous a cau&s;e, and to undergo &s;hame and reproach for &s;o kind and &s;o powerful a Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>HITHERTO the church at Jeru&s;alem had been to&s;&s;ed with gentle &s;torms, but now it was overtaken by a more violent tempe&s;t, which commenced with the death of the proto-martyr Stephen, and was now carried on with greater violence; nor did it end but with the di&s;per&s;ion of the di&s;ciples, by which means, the glad-tidings of the go&s;pel, which had till then been confined to Judea, and the profe&s;&s;ors of it hid in &s;ecret places, was now preached to the Gentile world, and an ancient prophecy fulfilled, which &s;ays, <HI>Out of Zion &s;hall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Thus does the Almighty bring good out of evil, and cau&s;e the malicious intentions of the wicked to redound to his prai&s;e, in the further &s;preading of the truth.</P>
<P>THE followers of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS being thus di&s;per&s;ed, Philip, the deacon, retired to Samaria, where he preached the go&s;pel, and confirmed his doctrine by many miraculous cures, and ca&s;ting out devils. In this city was one Simon, who, by magic arts and dia|bolical &s;orceries, was beheld with admiration by the people; and &s;ome con&s;idered him as the <HI>great power of God;</HI> a name he bla&s;phemou&s;ly gave him&s;elf, pretending to be the fir&s;t and chief deity, or what every nation con&s;idered as the &s;upreme God. This wicked
<PB N="358" REF="029927_0379_0FE33B4670B48180">
mortal, hearing the &s;ermons of Philip, and beholding the miracles wrought by him, be|came a convert to the religion of JESUS, and was bapti&s;ed with the others who had em|braced Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>SEVERAL of the apo&s;tles who continued at Jeru&s;alem, were &s;oon informed of this re|markable &s;ucce&s;s of Philip's mini&s;try at Samaria, and thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end him a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Accordingly, Peter and John were deputed to this infant church, who having prayed and laid their hands on the new converts, they received the Holy Gho&s;t. Such miraculous gifts a&s;toni&s;hed the magician, and de&s;irous of obtaining the &s;ame privilege, he offered the di&s;ciples money to inve&s;t him with this power, that on whom&s;oever he laid his hands he might receive the Holy Gho&s;t; but Peter, who perceived the in&s;incerity of his heart, rejected his offer with &s;corn and dete&s;tation. "<HI>Thy money,</HI> &s;aid that great apo&s;tle, <HI>peri&s;h with thee.</HI> And as thy heart is full of hypocri&s;y and deceit, thou can&s;t have no &s;hare nor portion in &s;o great a privilege. Thou woulde&s;t do well to repent for &s;o mon&s;trous a crime, and &s;incerely apply thy&s;elf to &s;eek the Almighty, that the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee; for I perceive that thy temper and di&s;po&s;ition of mind is &s;till vicious and corrupt, and that thou art yet bound by the chains of iniquity, and in a &s;tate di&s;plea&s;ing to the Almighty, and dangerous to the welfare of thy own &s;oul."</P>
<P>THIS &s;peech of St. Peter terrified Simon, his con&s;cience flew in his face, and he prayed the apo&s;tles to make interce&s;&s;ion for him to the throne of grace, that the Almighty might pardon his &s;in, and not inflict on him tho&s;e heavy judgments they had denounced.</P>
<P>AFTER this violent &s;torm, the church enjoyed a time of calmne&s;s and &s;erenity; during which St. Peter went to vi&s;it the churches lately planted in tho&s;e parts, by the di&s;ciples whom the per&s;ecution had di&s;per&s;ed: and at his arrival at Lydda, he miracu|lou&s;ly healed Eneas, who had been afflicted with the pal&s;y, and confined to his bed eight years; but on Peter's bidding him ari&s;e in the name of JESUS, he was immediately re|&s;tored to perfect health. Nor was the &s;ucce&s;s of this miracle confined to Eneas and his family, the fame of it being blazed through all the neighbouring country, and many believed in the doctrine of the Son of God. It was even known at Joppa, a &s;ea-port town, about &s;ix miles from Lydda; and the brethren immediately &s;ent for Peter, on the fol|lowing melancholy occa&s;ion: Tibatha, who&s;e Greek name was Dorcas, a woman vene|rable for her piety and exten&s;ive charity, was newly dead, to the great lo&s;s of all man|kind who loved the paths of virtue, e&s;pecially the poor and afflicted, who were &s;up|ported by her benevolence.</P>
<P>WHEN St. Peter arrived, he found her dre&s;&s;ed for her funeral &s;olemnity, and &s;urrounded by mournful widows, who &s;hewed the coats and garments wherewith &s;he had clothed them, the monuments of her liberality: but Peter put them all out, and kneeling down, prayed with the utmo&s;t fervency; then turning to the body, he commanded her to ari&s;e, and taking her by the hand, pre&s;ented her in perfect health to her friends and others, who were a&s;&s;embled to pay their la&s;t duties to &s;o good a woman. This miracle con|firmed tho&s;e who newly embraced the go&s;pel of JESUS, and converted many more to the faith. After which, he &s;tayed a con&s;iderable time here, and lodged in the hou&s;e of Simon a Tanner, at Joppa.</P>
<P>WHILE he abode in this city, one day, when he was offering up his prayers to the Al|mighty, he found him&s;elf hungry, and called for meat; but while it was dre&s;&s;ing for him, he fell into a trance, wherein was pre&s;ented to him a large &s;heet let down from heaven, containing all &s;orts of creatures, clean and unclean; and at the &s;ame time a voice &s;aid to him, <HI>Ari&s;e Peter, kill and eat</HI>: but the apo&s;tle, as yet tenacious of the rites and in&s;ti|tutions
<PB N="359" REF="029927_0380_0FE33A998E0AA678">
of the Mo&s;aic law, an&s;wered, that his con&s;cience refu&s;ed to comply, having never eaten any thing that was common or unclean. To which the voice replied, "That it was unju&s;t to con&s;ider that as common which God had clean&s;ed." This was done thrice, after which the ve&s;&s;el was again drawn up to heaven, and the vi&s;ion di&s;appeared. By this &s;ymbolical repre&s;entation, St. Peter was given to under&s;tand, that the Almighty was now going to &s;end him on a new emba&s;&s;y, which the Spirit at the &s;ame time command|ed him to undertake. While he was &s;till wondering with him&s;elf what the event could prove, three me&s;&s;engers knocked at the gate, enquiring for him; and from them he re|ceived the following account: That Cornelius, a Roman captain of a band of Italian &s;oldiers at Ce&s;area, a per&s;on of great piety and religion, one who had been long a pro&s;e|lyte of the gate, had &s;ent for him, by an immediate command from God. Peter accom|panied with &s;ome of the brethren, went the next day with the me&s;&s;engers, and &s;oon after arrived at Ce&s;area.</P>
<P>CORNELIUS having information of his coming, had &s;ummoned his friends and kindred to Ce&s;area; and at the apo&s;tle's entering his hou&s;e, fell at his feet, a method of addre&s;s frequent in the Ea&s;tern countries; but Peter, who con&s;idered that honour as due only to the Almighty, lifted him up, and declared to the company the rea&s;on of his coming, &s;ay|ing he had lately learned, that with God there was no re&s;pect of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the apo&s;tle had ended his &s;peech, Cornelius, at his reque&s;t, related the particular rea&s;on for his &s;ending for him. "Four days ago, &s;aid this Roman officer, being conver&s;ant in the duties of fa&s;ting and prayer, an angel from the courts of heaven appeared to me, declaring that my prayers and alms were come up as a memorial before the throne of the Mo&s;t High; and at the &s;ame time, ordered me to &s;end to Jop|pa, for one Simon Peter, who lodged at the hou&s;e of a Tanner near the &s;ea-&s;ides, who would give me further information in the duties of religion. Accordingly, I made no he&s;itation to obey the Heavenly me&s;&s;enger, but &s;ent immediately for thee."</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle was at fir&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed at this relation of the centurion; but he was &s;oon convinced that God had broken down the partition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wall, and no longer maintained a peculiar kindne&s;s for the &s;ons of Jacob; that it was not the nation&punc; but the religion; not the external quality of the man, but the internal temper of the mind, that recom|mended the human race to the favour of Omnipotence: that the devout and pious, the righteous and the good man, whatever part of the earth he may inhabit, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the favourite of heaven; that God as highly re&s;pects a ju&s;t and virtuous man in the barren wa&s;tes of Scythia, as on the mountain of Sion; that the reconciling and making peace between God and man by JESUS CHRIST, was the doctrine publi&s;hed by the prophets of old; and that God had now anointed and con&s;ecrated JESUS of Nazareth with divine power, in the exerci&s;e whereof he went about doing good to the children of men.</P>
<P>AT the time that Peter was thus preaching to them, the Holy Gho&s;t fell upon the greate&s;t part of his hearers, enabling them to &s;peak &s;everal languages, and in them to magnify the great Creator of the &s;ons of men. At this the Jews, who accompanied Peter, marvelled exceedingly, to &s;ee that the gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t were poured upon the Gentiles; and Peter &s;eeing this, told the company, that he knew no rea&s;on why the&s;e per&s;ons &s;hould not be baptized, as they had received the Holy Gho&s;t as well as them; and, accordingly, he gave orders that they &s;hould be baptized; and, to confirm them in the holy faith they had embraced, he tarried &s;ome time with them.</P>
<P>HAVING thus fini&s;hed his vi&s;itation to the new-planted churches, Peter returned to Je|ru&s;alem, and was indefatigable in in&s;tructing the converts in the religion of JESUS, and
<PB N="360" REF="029927_0381_0FE33A9B15B023A8">
preaching the glad-tidings of &s;alvation to the de&s;cendants of Jacob: but he did not long continue in this plea&s;ing cour&s;e; Herod Agrippa, in order to ingratiate him&s;elf into the favour of the Jews, put St. James to death, and finding the action was highly accepta|ble to that &s;tiff-necked people, he re&s;olved to extend his cruelty to Peter, and accor|dingly ca&s;t him into pri&s;on: but the churches were ince&s;&s;ant in their prayers to God for his &s;afety; and what have mortals to fear, when guarded by the hand of Omnipo|tence! Herod was per&s;uaded he &s;hould &s;oon accompli&s;h his intentions, and &s;acrifice Peter to the in&s;atiable cruelty of the Jews.</P>
<P>THE night before the intended execution, a me&s;&s;enger from the courts of heaven vi|&s;ited the gloomy horrors of the dungeon, where he found Peter a&s;leep between his keepers. The angel rai&s;ed him up, took off his chains, ordered him to gird on his gar|ments, and follow him: Peter obeyed, and having pa&s;&s;ed through the fir&s;t and &s;econd watch, they came to the iron gate leading to the city, which opened to them of its own accord: the angel al&s;o accompanied him through one of the &s;treets, and then departed from him; on which Peter came to him&s;elf, and perceived that it was no vi&s;ion, but that his great and beloved Ma&s;ter had really &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger from above, and relea&s;ed him from pri&s;on. He therefore repaired to the hou&s;e of Mary, where the church was a&s;&s;em|bled, and offering up their prayers to the throne of grace for his &s;afety. On his knock|ing at the door, a maid who came to let him in, knowing his voice, ran back to tell them that Peter was at the door, which they at fir&s;t con&s;idered as the effect of fancy: but the dam&s;el continuing to affirm that it was really true, they concluded it was an angel, or &s;ome me&s;&s;enger &s;ent to him from the courts of heaven: but on opening the door, they were convinced of their mi&s;take, finding that it was Peter him&s;elf, who briefly told them how he was delivered, and, de&s;iring them to inform his brethren of his being &s;et at li|berty, he retired from them.</P>
<P>THE officers came in the morning from Herod to the pri&s;on, with orders to bring Peter out to the people, who were gathered together to behold his execution: but when they came to the pri&s;on, the keepers informed them, that the apo&s;tle had made his e&s;cape; which &s;o exa&s;perated Herod, that he commanded tho&s;e to be put to death who were in|tru&s;ted with the care of the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>AFTER this miraculous deliverance of St. Peter, a controver&s;y aro&s;e between the Jewi&s;h and the Gentile converts, with regard to the ob&s;ervation of the Mo&s;aic law, a di&s;|pute which gave great unea&s;ine&s;s to the minds of many per&s;ons; the Jews zealou&s;ly con|tending, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation to be circumci&s;ed, and ob&s;erve the pre|cepts of the ceremonial law as well as tho&s;e of the go&s;pel. To compo&s;e this difference, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ummon a general council of the apo&s;tles and brethren to meet at Jeru&s;alem. This was accordingly done, and the ca&s;e thoroughly debated.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t Peter &s;tood up, and declared, that God having cho&s;en him out of all the apo&s;tles to be a preacher of the Go&s;pel, not only to the Jews, but al&s;o to the Gentiles, God who was be&s;t able to judge of the hearts of men, had borne witne&s;s to them, that they were ac|cepted of him by giving them his Holy Spirit, as he had done the Jews; and, con&s;equent|ly, that there was no difference between them.</P>
<P>ST. PETER's declaration convinced the church, and it was unanimou&s;ly decreed, that no other burthen than the temporary ob&s;ervance of a few particular precepts, equally con|venient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Jew and Gentile, &s;hould be impo&s;ed on them: and the deci&s;ion drawn up into a &s;ynodical epi&s;tle, and &s;ent to the &s;everal churches, for allaying the heats and controver&s;ies which had been occa&s;ioned by this di&s;pute.</P>

<P><PB N="361" REF="029927_0383_0FE33AA630ACF7D0">PETER &s;oon after left Jeru&s;alem, and went down to Antioch; where, u&s;ing the liberty given him by the go&s;pel, he freely ate and conver&s;ed with the Gentile pro&s;elytes, con&s;idering them now as <HI>fellow-citizens with the &s;aints, and of the hou&s;ehold of God.</HI> This he had been taught by the vi&s;ion of the &s;heet let down from heaven; this had been lately decreed at Jeru&s;alem; this he had before practi&s;ed with regard to Cornelius and his family, and ju&s;tified the action to the &s;atisfaction of his accu&s;ers; and this he had freely and innocently done at Antioch, till &s;ome of the Jewi&s;h brethren coming thither, he, for fear of offending them, withdrew him&s;elf from the Gentiles, as if it had been unlawful for him to hold conver&s;ation with uncircumci&s;ed per&s;ons; notwith&s;tand|ing he knew, and was fully &s;atisfied, that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had broken down the partition-wall between the Jews and Gentiles, under the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>HAVING thus acted again&s;t the light of his own mind and judgment, Peter condemn|ed what he had approved, and de&s;troyed the &s;uper&s;tructure he had before erected; at the &s;ame time, he confirmed the Jewi&s;h zealots in their inveterate errors, filled the minds of the Gentiles with &s;cruples, and their con&s;ciences with fears. Nor was this all, the old prejudices between Jew and Gentile were revived, and the whole number of Jewi&s;h converts, following the apo&s;tle's examples, &s;eperated them&s;elves from the company of the Gentile Chri&s;tians; nay, even Barnabas him&s;elf was carried away by the torrent of unwarrantable practice that now unhappily prevailed.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle Paul was now at Antioch, and re&s;olutely oppo&s;ed St. Peter to his face; he publicly reproved him as a per&s;on worthy to be blamed for his gro&s;s prevarication. He rea&s;oned and &s;everely expo&s;tulated with him, that he who was him&s;elf a Jew, and con&s;equently under a more immediate obligation of ob&s;erving the Mo&s;aic law, &s;hould throw off the yoke him&s;elf, and at the &s;ame time endeavour to impo&s;e it on the Gen|tiles, who were never under the nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving the ceremonies of the I&s;raelites; a &s;evere, though an impartial charge.</P>
<P>THUS far we have had an infalliable guide to direct us in writing the life of this great apo&s;tle; but here the &s;acred hi&s;torian hath left us, and therefore we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the ancients for materials in the further pro&s;ecution of his hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>BEFORE this conte&s;t at Antioch, St. Peter had preached the go&s;pel in various parts of the world, enlarged the kingdom of his great Ma&s;ter, and &s;preading the glad-tidings of &s;alvation among&s;t the inhabitants of various countries; and, among&s;t the re&s;t, tho&s;e of Rome, then the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world. In that capital he is &s;aid to have continued &s;everal years, till the emperor Claudius taking advantage of &s;ome &s;editious tumults rai&s;ed by the Jews, publi&s;hed an edict, whereby they were bani&s;hed from Rome, and among&s;t the re&s;t St. Peter, who returned to Jeru&s;alem, and was pre&s;ent at the &s;ynod already mentioned; but how long he continued in the capital of Judea is uncertain; for we have no account of his tran&s;actions for many years. This however is certain, that he was not idle in the &s;ervice of his great Ma&s;ter; and Eu&s;ebius tells us, from Metaphra&s;tes, that he vi&s;ited &s;everal of the we&s;tern parts, and particularly the i&s;land of Great Britain, where he continued &s;everal years, &s;preading the glad-tidings of &s;alvation in the&s;e remote parts, and converting the &s;everal nations to the faith of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this be, whether St. Peter was or was not in England, it is certain, that towards the latter end of Nero's reign he returned to Rome, where he found the minds of the people &s;trongly bewitched, and hardened again&s;t the doctrines of the go&s;pel by the &s;orceries of Simon Magus, who, as I have already ob&s;erved, was cha&s;ti&s;ed by
<PB N="362" REF="029927_0384_0FE33AA7B67B5788">
Peter for his wickedne&s;s at Samaria. This Mon&s;ter of impiety not only oppo&s;ed the preaching of the apo&s;tles, but al&s;o did all in his power to render them and their doctrines odious to the emperor. St. Peter fore&s;eeing that the calumnies of Simon and his ad|herents would ha&s;ten his death, took the greater pains, and was &s;till more a&s;&s;iduous to confirm tho&s;e he had been any ways in&s;trumental in converting in the &s;ublime truths they had received.</P>
<P>IN order to this, the apo&s;tle &s;trongly oppo&s;ed the great deceiver of mankind; for in the la&s;t year of his life, he &s;eems to have written his two epi&s;tles to the di&s;per&s;ed Jews in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, and Bythinia; and, in an appointed encounter with Simon, di&s;covered his magical impo&s;tures, and through the power and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Almighty, brought him to an exemplary and mi&s;erable death.</P>
<P>THE account of the mi&s;erable end of this unhappy man no &s;ooner reached the empe|ror's ears, than he vowed revenge, both for the death of his favourite, and the endea|vours u&s;ed by the apo&s;tles to <HI>turn mankind from darkne&s;s unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</HI> Accordingly, he i&s;&s;ued orders for apprehending St. Peter, together with his companion St. Paul. St. Ambro&s;e tells us, that when the people perceived the dan|ger to which St. Peter was now expo&s;ed, they prayed him to quit Rome, and repair for a while to &s;ome &s;ecure retreat, that his life might be pre&s;erved for the benefit of the church. Peter, with great reluctance, yielded to their entreaties, and made his e&s;cape by night: but as he pa&s;&s;ed the gate, he was met by a per&s;on in the form of his great and beloved Ma&s;ter, and on Peter's a&s;king him, whither he was going, an&s;wered, "To Rome to be crucified the &s;econd time:" which Peter taking for a reproof of his cowardice, re|turned again into the city, was &s;oon after apprehended, and ca&s;t, together with St. Paul, into the Mamertine pri&s;on. Here they were confined eight or nine months, but &s;pent their time in the exerci&s;e of religion, e&s;pecially in preaching to the pri&s;oners, and tho&s;e who re&s;orted to them: and during this confinement, it is generally thought St. Peter wrote his &s;econd epi&s;tle to the di&s;per&s;ed Jews; wherein he endeavours to confirm them in the belief and practice of Chri&s;tianity, and to fortify them again&s;t tho&s;e poi&s;onous and pernicious principles and actions, which began to break in upon the church, then in its infancy.</P>
<P>AT length, Nero returning from Achaia, he entered Rome in triumph; and &s;oon after his arrival, re&s;olved that the apo&s;tles &s;hould fall as victims and &s;acrifices to his cruelty and revenge. While the fatal &s;troke was daily expected, the Chri&s;tians in Rome were continually offering up their prayers to heaven to protect tho&s;e two holy per&s;ons: but the Almighty was now willing to put an end to their &s;orrows; and after &s;ealing the truth they had preached with their own blood, to receive them into the regions of eternal bli&s;s and happine&s;s, and exchange their crowns of martyrdom for crowns of glory. Ac|cordingly, they were both condemned by the cruel emperor of Rome; and St. Peter having taken his farewell of the brethren, e&s;pecially St. Paul, was taken from the pri&s;on, and led to the top of the Vatican mount, near the Tiber, where he was &s;entenced to &s;ur|render up his life by crucifixion.</P>
<P>COMING to the place of execution, he begged the favour of the officers, that he might not be crucified in the common manner, but with his head downwards; affirming, that he was unworthy to &s;uffer in the &s;ame po&s;ture in which his Lord had &s;uffered before him. This reque&s;t was accordingly complied with, and the great apo&s;tle St. Peter &s;ur|rendered up his &s;oul into the hands of his great and beneficent Ma&s;ter, who came down from heaven to ran&s;om mankind from de&s;truction, and to open the gates of the heavenly Canaan to all believers.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="029927_0385_0FE33AA9601833A8">THE body of Peter being taken down from the cro&s;s, is &s;aid to have been embalmed by Mercellinus the pre&s;byter after the manner of the Jews, and then buried in the Vatican, near the Appian way, two miles from Rome. Here it remained till the time of pope Cornelius, who conveyed it to the Vatican at Rome, where it re&s;ted in an ob&s;cure place, till the reign of Con&s;tantine, who, from the great reverence he entertained for the Chri&s;tian religion, erected many churches at Rome, and rebuilt and va&s;tly enlarged the Vatican in honour of St. Peter.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider St. Peter as a man, there will &s;eem to have been a natural eagerne&s;s pre|dominant in his temper, which animated his &s;oul to the mo&s;t bold and generous under|takings: but if we con&s;ider him as a di&s;ciple of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, we &s;hall find him exemplary in the great duties of religion. To conclude: if we con&s;ider him as an apo&s;tle, as a pa&s;tor, or &s;hepherd of the &s;ouls of men, we &s;hall find him faithful and dili|gent in his office, zealou&s;ly endeavouring to in&s;truct the ignorant, reduce the erroneous, &s;trengthen the weak, confirm the &s;trong, reclaim the vicious, and turn the children of men into the paths of righteou&s;ne&s;s. He never omitted any opportunity of preaching to the people, and &s;preading the glad-tidings of the go&s;pel among&s;t the human race: and &s;o powerful were his di&s;cour&s;es, that he converted many thou|&s;ands at one time. How many painful journies and dangerous voyages did he un|dertake! With what unconquerable patience did he endure the greate&s;t trials, &s;urmount every difficulty, and remove every ob&s;tacle, that he might plant the go&s;pel of his beloved Ma&s;ter! Never refu&s;ing even to lay down his life to promote it: nor was he only a&s;&s;idu|ous to perform the&s;e duties him&s;elf; he was al&s;o careful to animate others to do the like, earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ing and per&s;uading the pa&s;tors and governors of the church to feed the flock of God, to labour freely for the good of the &s;ouls of men, and not undertake tho&s;e offices to acquire advantages to them&s;elves; be&s;eeching them to treat the flock committed to their care with lenity and gentlene&s;s, and to be them&s;elves &s;hining exam|ples of piety and religion, the &s;ure&s;t method of rendering their mini&s;try &s;ucce&s;sful: and, becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to be always pre&s;ent, to teach and warn the chil|dren of men, he endeavoured by letters to imprint in their minds the practice of what they had been taught: a method, he tells us, he was re&s;olved to pur&s;ue, as long as he continued an inhabitant of this world; thinking it meet, while he was in this taber|nacle, to &s;tir up the profe&s;&s;ors of the go&s;pel, by putting them in mind of the&s;e things; that &s;o they might be able after his decea&s;e to have them always in remembrance, and not let them &s;lip out of their minds.</P>

<HEAD>ST. JUDE, THE APOSTLE.</HEAD>
<P>ST. JUDE is mentioned by three &s;everal names in the evangelical hi&s;tory, namely, Jude or Judas, Thaddeus, and Lebbeus. The fir&s;t he had in common with the other Jews, and in honour of one of the twelve patriarchs; the other two might be added to the former, partly to di&s;tingui&s;h him from Judas the traitor, who had rendered the name odious to the Chri&s;tians, and partly as a commendation of his wi&s;dom and zeal: for Lebbeus, according to St. Jerom, &s;ignifies a man of under&s;tanding, and Thaddeus imports divine favour; and hence &s;ome of the fathers call him Zelotes, or Zealous.</P>
<P>THIS apo&s;tle was brother to St. James the Le&s;s, afterwards bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem, be|ing the &s;on of Jo&s;eph, the reputed father of CHRIST, by a former wife. It is not known when, or by what means, he became a di&s;ciple of our ble&s;&s;ed Savour, nothing being &s;aid of him, till we find him in the catalogue of the twelve apo&s;tles; nor afterwards till

CHRIST's la&s;t &s;upper, when di&s;cour&s;ing with them about his departure, and comforting them with a promi&s;e, that he would return to them again, meaning after his re&s;urrec|tion, and that the world &s;hould &s;ee him no more, though they &s;hould &s;ee him; our apo&s;tle &s;aid to his Ma&s;ter, <HI>Lord, how is it that thou wilt manife&s;t thy&s;elf unto us, and not unto the world?</HI> It &s;eems, from this que&s;tion, that St. Jude expected that the Me&s;&s;iah would e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;ecuar kingdom; and, therefore, could not reconcile the &s;olemnity and grandeur of it, with the private manife&s;tations of CHRIST to his di&s;ciples only.</P>
<P>IT is affirmed by St. Jerom, that St. Thomas &s;ent St. Jude the apo&s;tle, &s;oon after our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion, to Ede&s;&s;a, to heal Abagarus: but this is a mi&s;take, it being Thaddeus, one of the &s;eventy di&s;ciples, and not Judas Thaddeus the apo&s;tle, who was &s;ent to Abagarus.</P>
<P>WE are told by Paulinus, that the province which fell to the &s;hare of St. Jude in the apo&s;tolic divi&s;ion of the provinces, was Lybia; but he does not tell us, whether it was the Cyrenean Lybia, which is thought to have received the go&s;pel from St. Mark, or the more &s;outhern part of Africa: but however that be, in his fir&s;t &s;etting out to preach the go&s;pel, he travelled up and down Judea and Galilee; then through Samaria into Idumea, and to the cities of Arabia, and the neighbouring countries, and afterwards to Syria and Me&s;opotamia. Nicephorus adds, that he came at la&s;t to Ede&s;&s;a, where Abagarus go|verned, and where Thaddeus, one of the &s;eventy, had already &s;own the &s;eeds of the go&s;pel. Here he perfected what the other had begun; and having by his &s;ermons and miracles e&s;tabli&s;hed the religion of JESUS, he died in peace; but others &s;ay that he was &s;tain at Berytes, and honourably buried there.</P>
<P>THE writers of the Latin church are unanimous in declaring, that St. Jude travelled into Per&s;ia, where, after great &s;ucce&s;s in his apo&s;tolical mini&s;try for many years, he was at la&s;t, for his free and open reproving the &s;uper&s;titious rites and cu&s;toms of the Magi, cruelly put to death by the enemies of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>WE do not find that St. Jude left more than one epi&s;tle, which is placed the la&s;t of tho&s;e &s;even, &s;tyled catholic, in the &s;acred canon. It hath no particular in&s;cription, as the other &s;ix have, but is thought to have been primarily intended for the Chri&s;tian Jews, in their &s;everal di&s;per&s;ions, as St. Peter's epi&s;tles were. In it he tells them, "That he at fir&s;t intended to write to them in general of the common &s;alvation, and e&s;tabli&s;h and confirm them in it: but &s;eeing the doctrine of CHRIST attacked on every &s;ide by He|retics, he conceived it more nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pend his time in exhorting them to fight man|fully in defence of <HI>the faith once delivered to the &s;aints,</HI> and oppo&s;e the fal&s;e teachers who laboured &s;o indefatigably to corrupt the truth."</P>
<P>IT is generally under&s;tood, the Heretics meant in this epi&s;tle, were the Nicolatans, the Gno&s;tics, the followers of Simon Magus and others of the &s;ame kind, who&s;e morals were as corrupt as their doctrine, tru&s;ting to a faith without works, as &s;ufficient to their &s;alvation: &s;o that the &s;ubject of St. Jude's epi&s;tle is nearly the &s;ame with that of the &s;econd of St. Peter, who&s;e &s;en&s;e he generally follows, and often u&s;es the very &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions: only as the infection had &s;pread it&s;elf further, and had gotten more ground, he &s;eems to oppo&s;e tho&s;e Heretics with more zeal and &s;harpne&s;s than St. Peter had done: but becau&s;e true Chri&s;tian charity, though it be zealous, yet is without bitterne&s;s and hatred, he exhorts the Chri&s;tians to u&s;e gentle methods with tho&s;e deluded people, and to pluck them as brands out of the fire; meaning by fire, their impious principles and practices, which if continued in, would certainly con&s;ume them. He &s;eems expre&s;sly to cite St. Peter's &s;econd epi&s;tle, and to intimate plainly that mo&s;t of the apo&s;tles were dead; &s;o that his epi&s;tle &s;eems not to have been written till after Nero's reign and the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem by the Romans.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="029927_0387_0FE33AB4401410B8">THIS epi&s;tle was not at fir&s;t generally received in the church: the author indeed, like St. James, St. John, and &s;ometimes St. Paul him&s;elf, does not call him&s;elf an apo&s;tle, &s;tyling him&s;elf only <HI>the &s;ervant of Chri&s;t:</HI> but he has added what is equivalent, <HI>Jude the brother of James,</HI> a character that can belong to none but our apo&s;tle: and &s;urely the humility of a follower of JESUS &s;hould be no objection again&s;t his writings, but rather be a recommendation of them.</P>
<P>ONE great objection again&s;t this epi&s;tle, was, the apo&s;tle's mentioning the tradition of Michael the archangel contending with the Devil about the body of Mo&s;es, but he has done no more than St. Paul in nameing Jannes and Jambres; namely, alleging a &s;tory which was then current and acknowledged by the Jews, though nothing of it was in&s;erted in the &s;acred writings, &s;o that St. Jude rea&s;ons with the Jews from their own authors and conce&s;&s;ions, the more ea&s;ily to convince and confute them.</P>
<P>WE have now, we tru&s;t, obviated the difficulties that have ari&s;en concerning the epi&s;tle of St. Jude; and Eu&s;ebius tells us, that in his time mo&s;t churches read it pub|licly: it is indeed evident, that before the clo&s;e of the fourth age, it was acknowledged as canonical Scripture, in the councils of Laodicea and Carthage, by general con&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF ST. THOMAS THE APOSTLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Jews, when they travelled into foreign countries, or familiarly conver&s;ed with the Greeks and Romans, were wont to a&s;&s;ume a Latin name of the &s;ame &s;ignifi|cation, or at lea&s;t that bore &s;ome affinity with that by which they were known in their own country. Thus our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour was called CHRIST, an&s;wering to his Hebrew title <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> the anointed: Simon, who was called <HI>Caphas</HI> in Hebrew, was &s;tyled <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tros</HI> in Greek, both &s;ignifying a rock: <HI>Tabitha</HI> was called <HI>Dorcas,</HI> both &s;ignifying a goat: and thus <HI>Thomas,</HI> according to the Syriac import of his name, was called <HI>Didymus,</HI> a twin, which is the meaning of both appellations.</P>
<P>THERE is no mention in the evangelical hi&s;tory either of the country or kindred of St. Thomas: it is however certain that he was a Jew, and in all probability a Gali|lean. Metaphra&s;tes tell us, that he was de&s;cended from very mean parents, who brought him up to the trade of fi&s;hing; but at the &s;ame time, took care to give him a more u&s;eful education, in&s;tructing him in the knowledge of the Scripture, whereby he learned wi&s;ely to regulate his conduct.</P>
<P>THIS apo&s;tle was, together with the re&s;t, called to the apo&s;tle&s;hip and not long after gave an eminent in&s;tance of his being ready to undergo the mo&s;t melancholy fate that might attend him: for when the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles were di&s;&s;uading their Ma&s;ter from going into Judea at the time of Lazarus's death, becau&s;e the Jews lately endeavoured to &s;tone him, Thomas de&s;ired them not to hinder his journey thither, though it might co&s;t them all their lives: <HI>Let us go,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that we may die with him;</HI> concluding that in&s;tead of Lazarus being rai&s;ed from the dead, they &s;hould all, like him, be placed in the chambers of the du&s;t.</P>
<P>THE holy JESUS, a little before his &s;ufferings, had been &s;peaking to them of the joys of heaven, and had told them, that he was going to prepare man&s;ions for them, that they might follow him, and that they knew both the place whither he was going, and the way thither; on hearing this, our apo&s;tle replied, that they knew not whither he was going, much le&s;s the way that would lead them thither. To which our Lord

returned this &s;hort but &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, <HI>I am the way;</HI> I am the per&s;on whom the Father hath &s;ent into the world to &s;hew mankind the paths that lead to eternal life, and therefore you cannot mi&s;s the way if you follow my example, and obey my precepts.</P>
<P>THE minds of the di&s;ciples, who had &s;een their great Ma&s;ter expire on the cro&s;s, were di&s;tracted by hopes and fears concerning his re&s;urrection, about which they were not then fully &s;atisfied, which engaged him the &s;ooner to ha&s;ten his appearance, that by the &s;en&s;ible manife&s;tations of him&s;elf he might put the matter beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;pute. Accordingly, the very day on which he aro&s;e from the dead, he came into the hou&s;e where they were a&s;&s;embled, while, for fear of the Jews, the doors were clo&s;e &s;hut, and gave them &s;ufficient a&s;&s;urance, that he was ri&s;en from the dead. Thomas was not pre&s;ent at this meeting, having probably never rejoined their company &s;ince their di&s;per&s;ion in the garden, when every one's fears prompted him to con&s;ult his own &s;afety. At his return, they told him, that the Lord had appeared to them, but he ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to give credit to what they &s;aid, or to believe that it was really he, pre&s;uming it rather a &s;pectre or apparation, unle&s;s he might &s;ee the very print of the nails, and feel the wounds in his hands and &s;ide: a &s;trong piece of infide|lity! Was it any thing more than what Mo&s;es and the prophets had long &s;ince fore|told? Had not our Lord frequently declared in plain terms, that he mu&s;t ri&s;e from the dead the third day? And could they que&s;tion the po&s;&s;ibility of what he told them, when they had &s;o often &s;een him work the greate&s;t miracles.</P>
<P>THE &s;tubbornne&s;s of Thomas, on this occa&s;ion, might have betrayed him into an eter|nal infidelity; but our compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour would not take the advantage of his per|ver&s;e ob&s;tinacy; for, on that day &s;even-night he came again to them, as they were met at their &s;olemn devotions, and, calling to Thomas, bade him look upon his hands, put his fingers into the print of the nails, and thru&s;t his hand into his &s;ide, to &s;atisfy his faith by a demon&s;tration from the &s;en&s;es. Thomas was &s;oon convinced of his error and ob&s;tinacy, confe&s;&s;ing that he now acknowledged him to be his Lord and Ma&s;ter, a God omnipotent, as he was thus able to re&s;cue him&s;elf from the power of death. Our Lord an&s;wered, that it was happy for him that he believed the te&s;timony of his own &s;en&s;es; but that it was a more noble and commendable act of faith, to acquie&s;ce in a rational evidence, and to receive the doctrines and precepts of the go&s;pel upon &s;uch te&s;timonies and a&s;&s;urances as will &s;atisfy a wi&s;e and &s;ober man, though he did not him&s;elf behold them.</P>
<P>AFTER the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS had left this vale of mi&s;ery, and be&s;towed eminent gifts and miraculous powers on the apo&s;tles, St. Thomas, as well as the re&s;t, preached the go&s;pel in &s;everal parts of Judea; and, after the di&s;per&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian church in Jeru&s;alem, repaired into Parthia, the province a&s;&s;igned him for his mini&s;try. After which, as Sempronius and others inform us, he preached the go&s;pel to the Medes, Per&s;ians, Cara|manians, Hyrcanis, Bactarians, and the neighbouring nations.</P>
<P>DEPARTING from Per&s;ia he travelled into Ethiopia, preaching the glad-tidings of the Go&s;pel, healing the &s;ick, and working other miracles, to prove he had his commi&s;&s;ion from on high. And after travelling through the&s;e countries, he entered the Indian territories.</P>
<P>WE are told by Nicephorus, that he was at fir&s;t unwilling to enter the&s;e countries, fearing he &s;hould find their manners as rude and intractable as their faces were black and deformed, till encouraged by a vi&s;ion, wherein he was a&s;&s;ured of the Divine Pre&s;ence to

a&s;&s;i&s;t him. He travelled a great way into the Ea&s;tern countries, and even vi&s;ited the i&s;land Taprobane, &s;ince called Sumatra, and the country of the Brachmans, preaching every where with the greate&s;t gentlene&s;s, and u&s;ing the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive di&s;cour&s;es, not flying out into invectives again&s;t their idolatrous practices, but calmly in&s;tructing them in the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, per&s;uading them by degrees to renounce their follies, well knowing that confirmed habits mu&s;t be cured by patience and forbearance, by &s;low and gentle methods; and by the&s;e means he reclaimed the people from the gro&s;&s;e&s;t errors and &s;uper&s;titions, to an hearty belief and reception of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>THE Portegue&s;e, when they fir&s;t vi&s;ited the&s;e countries, after their di&s;covery of a pa&s;|&s;age by the Cape of Good Hope, received the following particulars, partly from ancient monuments, and partly from con&s;tant and uncontroverted traditions pre&s;erved by the Chri&s;tians in tho&s;e parts; namely, that St. Thomas came fir&s;t to Socotora, an i&s;land in the Arabian &s;ea, and thence to Cranganor, where, having converted many from the error of their ways, he travelled further into the Ea&s;t: and having &s;ucce&s;sfully preached the go&s;pel, returned back to the kingdom of Coromandel, where at Mallipur, the me|tropolis of the kingdom, not far from the mouth of the Ganges, he began to erect a place for divine wor&s;hip, till prohibited by the idolatrous prie&s;ts, as well as by Sagamo, prince of that country: but after performing &s;everal miracles, the work was &s;uffered to proceed, and Sagamo him&s;elf embraced the Chri&s;tian faith, who&s;e example was &s;oon followed by great numbers of his &s;ubjects and attendants.</P>
<P>THE Brachmans were greatly alarmed at this remarkable &s;ucce&s;s, at they plainly per|ceived that their religion would &s;oon be extirpated, unle&s;s &s;ome method could be found of putting a &s;top to the progre&s;s of Chri&s;tianity: and therefore re&s;olved to put the apo&s;tle to death. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from the city was a tomb, whither St. Thomas often retired for private devotions. Hither the Brachmans and their armed followers pur&s;ued him, and while he was intent at prayer, they fir&s;t &s;hot at him a &s;hower of darts, after which, one of the prie&s;ts ran him through with a lance. His body was taken up by his di&s;ciples, and buried in the church he had lately erected, and which was afterwards improved into a &s;tately and magnificent fabric.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to St. Chry&s;o&s;tom, St. Thomas, who at fir&s;t was the weake&s;t and mo&s;t incredulous of all the apo&s;tles, became, through CHRIST's conde&s;cen&s;ion to &s;atisfy his &s;cruples, and the power of the divine grace, the mo&s;t active and invincible of them all; travelling over mo&s;t parts of the world, and living without fear in the mid&s;t of barbarous nations, for the propagation of the Chri&s;tian faith.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF ST. ANDREW, THE APOSTLE.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the &s;acred hi&s;torians have largely de&s;cribed the tran&s;actions of St. Peter and St. Paul, yet we find they have been &s;paring in their accounts of the other apo&s;tles, giving us only now and then a few oblique &s;trokes and accidental remarks con|cerning them. Why no more of their re&s;pective actions were recorded by the penmen of the Holy Scriptures, is to us unknown: perhaps the Divine Providence thought it convenient that no further account &s;hould be given of the fir&s;t planting of Chri&s;tianity in the world, than what concerned Judea and the neighbouring countries, at lea&s;t the mo&s;t eminent places in the Roman empire, that the truth of the prophetical predictions might appear, which had foretold, That <HI>the law</HI> of the Me&s;&s;iah <HI>&s;hould come forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Be&s;ides a particular relation of the acts of &s;o many apo&s;tles, performed in &s;o many countries, mu&s;t have &s;welled the &s;acred

volumes to an enormous bulk, and con&s;equently rendered them le&s;s &s;erviceable to the u&s;e of Chri&s;tians in general.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle St. Andrew was born at Beth&s;aida, a city of Galilee, built on the banks of the lake of Genne&s;areth, and was the &s;on to John or Jonas, a fi&s;herman of that town. He was brother to Simon Peter, but whether elder or younger, is not certainly known though the generality of the ancients intimate that he was the younger: but, however that be, he was brought up to his father's trade, at which he laboured till our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour called him to be a fi&s;her of men, for which he was, by &s;ome preparatory in&s;titu|tions qualified even before the appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah, in his public character.</P>
<P>WE are told by the evangeli&s;t, John the Bapti&s;t had lately preached the doctrine of repentance; and was, by the generality of the Jews, from the impartiality of his pre|cept<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and the remarkable &s;trictne&s;s and au&s;terity of his life, held in great veneration. He trained up his pro&s;elytes under the di&s;cipline of repentance, and, by urging on them a &s;evere change and reformation of life, prepared them to entertain the doc|trine of the Me&s;&s;iah, who&s;e approach he told them was now near at hand; repre|&s;enting to them the greatne&s;s of his per&s;on, and the importance of the de&s;ign for which he came into the world.</P>
<P>BESIDES the multitudes that flocked to the Bapti&s;t's di&s;cour&s;es, he accordingly to the cu&s;tom of the Jewi&s;h ma&s;ters, had &s;ome peculiar and &s;elect di&s;ciples, who more con&s;tantly attended on his lectures, and generally waited upon his per&s;on. In the number of the&s;e followers was our apo&s;tle; who was with him beyond Jordan, when the Me&s;&s;iah, who had &s;ome time before been bapti&s;ed, came that way. Upon his approach, the Bapti&s;t pointed him out as the Me&s;&s;iah, &s;tyling him <HI>the Lamb of God,</HI> the true &s;acrifice, that was to expiate the &s;ins of the world.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the Bapti&s;t had given this character of JESUS, Andrew, and another di&s;|ciple, probably St. John, followed the Saviour of mankind to the place of his abode; from whence, after &s;ome conver&s;ation with him, Andrew departed, and having found his brother Simon, informed him that he had di&s;covered the great Me&s;&s;iah, &s;o long expected by the hou&s;e of Jacob; and, accordingly, brought him to JESUS. They did not, however, &s;tay long with their Ma&s;ter, but returned to their occupation.</P>
<P>UPWARDS of a year afterwards, JESUS pa&s;&s;ing through Galilee, found Andrew and Peter fi&s;hing on the &s;ea of Galilee, where he fully &s;atisfied them of the greatne&s;s and divinity of his per&s;on, by a miraculous draught of fi&s;hes which they took at his com|mand. He now told them, that they &s;hould enter on a different &s;eries of labours, and, in&s;tead of fi&s;h, they &s;hould by the efficacy and influence of their doctrine, catch men; commanding them to follow him, as his immediate di&s;ciples and attendants; and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y accordingly left all and followed him immediately.</P>
<P>ANDREW, together with the re&s;t, was &s;hortly after called to the office and honour of the apo&s;tolate, and made choice of to be one of CHRIST's immediate vicegerents for planting and propagating the Chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>WE learn from the &s;acred hi&s;torian, that after the a&s;cen&s;ion of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS into heaven, and the Holy Gho&s;t had de&s;cended in a vi&s;ible manner on the apo&s;tles, St An|drew was cho&s;en to preach the go&s;pel in Scythia, and the countries adjacent. He ac|cordingly departed for Jeru&s;alem, and fir&s;t travelled through Cappadocia, Galatia, and Bithynia, in&s;tructing the inhabitants in the faith of CHRIST, and continued his journey along the Euxine &s;ea into the &s;olitudes of Scythia.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="029927_0392_0FE33AC56E9143C0">ST. ANDREW afterwards arrived at Sinope, a city &s;ituated on the &s;ame &s;ea, and famous both for the birth and burial of king Mithridates: here he met with his brother Peter&punc; and &s;taid with him a con&s;iderable time at this place. The inhabitants of Sinope were mo&s;tly Jews, who partly, from a zeal for their religion, and partly from their bar|barous manner, were exa&s;perated again&s;t St. Andrew, and entered into a confederacy to burn the hou&s;e in which he lodged: but being di&s;appointed in this de&s;ign, they treated him with the mo&s;t &s;avage cruelty, throwing him on the ground, &s;tamping upon him with their feet, pulling and dragging him from place to place: &s;ome beating him with clubs, &s;ome pelting him with &s;tones, and others to &s;atisfy their brutal revenge, biting off his fle&s;h with their teeth; till apprehending they had entirely deprived him of life, they ca&s;t him out into the fields: but he miraculou&s;ly recovered, and returned publicly into the city; by which and other miracles he wrought among them, he converted many from the error of their ways, and induced them to become di&s;ciples of the Son of God.</P>
<P>AFTER departing from Sinope, he returned to Amyn&s;us, pa&s;&s;ed from thence through Trapezius, and Neocae&s;area to Sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ata, where he &s;ilenced the accute&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t philo&s;ophers of that country; and, having &s;pent &s;ome time there in preaching the glad-tidings of the go&s;pel, he returned to Jeru&s;alem: but he did not continue long in his native country, returning again to the province allotted him for the exer|ci&s;e of his mini&s;try, travelling fir&s;t into the country of the Aba&s;gi, and had great &s;ucce&s;s in the go&s;pel to the inhabitants of the city of Seba&s;tople, &s;ituated on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Euxine &s;ea, between the rivers Pha&s;is, and Ab&s;arus; from thence he removed into the country of the Zecchi, and the Bo&s;phorani; but find|ing the people remarkably barbarous and intractable, he did not &s;tay long among&s;t them, except at Cher&s;on, a large and populous city within the Bo&s;phorus, where he had great &s;ucce&s;s in his mini&s;try; and therefore continued &s;ome time with the new converts, to in&s;truct and confirm them in the faith. From this city he pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ea to Sinope, the royal &s;eat of Mithridates to encourage and confirm the churches he had planted in tho&s;e parts; and here he ordained Philologos, formerly one of St. Paul's di&s;ciples, bi&s;hop thereof.</P>
<P>ST. ANDREW, after leaving Sinope, came to Byzantium, &s;ince called Con&s;tantinople, where he in&s;tructed the inhabitants in the Chri&s;tian religion, founded a church for divine wor&s;hip, and ordained Stachys, fir&s;t bi&s;hop of that place: but being bani&s;h|ed from the city, he fled to Argyropolis, were he preached the go&s;pel for two years together with remarkable &s;ucce&s;s, converting great numbers to the Chri&s;tian faith. He next travelled over Thrace, Macedonia, The&s;&s;aly, Achaia, and Epirus, preaching the go&s;pel, propagating Chri&s;tianity, and confirming the doctrine he taught with &s;igns and miracles. At la&s;t he came to Petrea, a city of Achaia, where he gave his la&s;t and greate&s;t te&s;timony to the go&s;pel of his divine Ma&s;ter; we mean, he &s;ealed it with his blood, and received the crown of martyrdom by the follow|ing means.</P>
<P>AEGEAS, who was procon&s;ul of Achaia, came at this time to Patrea where ob|&s;erving that multitudes had abandoned the heathen religion, and embraced Chri&s;|tianity he had recour&s;e to every method both of favour and cruelty, to reduce the people to their old idolatry. The apo&s;tle, whom no difficulties or dangers could deter from performing the duties of his mini&s;try, addre&s;&s;ed the procon&s;ul, and calmly put him in mind, that being only a judge of men, he ought to revere him who was the &s;upreme and impartial Judge of all, pay him the divine honours due to his exalted Maje&s;ty, and abandon the impieties of his idolatrous wor&s;hip. The
<PB N="370" REF="029927_0393_0FE33AC6F083C108">
procon&s;ul, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;enting to the&s;e arguments of the apo&s;tle, ridiculed him as an inno|vator in religion, and a propagator of that &s;uper&s;tition, who&s;e author the Jews had put to the infamous death of the cro&s;s. On his mentioning the cro&s;s, our apo&s;tle took the opportunity of repre&s;enting to him the infinite love and kindne&s;s of our great Redeemer, who came down from heaven to purcha&s;e the &s;alvation of mankind; and to obtain it, did not di&s;dain to die upon the cro&s;s. The procon&s;ul an&s;wered, that he might hope to per&s;uade the credulous multitude of the truth of what he &s;aid; but, for his part, he would not li&s;ten to &s;uch a legentary tale: and if he did not comply with him, in doing &s;acrifice to the gods, he would cau&s;e him to &s;uffer upon that cro&s;s he had &s;o highly magnified. St. Andrew replied, that he &s;acrificed every day to God, the only true and omnipotent being, not with fumes and bloody offering, but in the &s;acrifice of the immaculate Lamb of God. This an&s;wer provoked the procon&s;ul, and he committed the apo&s;tle to pri&s;on; which &s;o exa&s;perated the people, that a mutiny would have en&s;ued, had not St. Andrew re&s;tored them, per&s;uading them to imitate the mildne&s;s and patience of the meek and humble JESUS, and not hinder him from receiving the crown of martyrdom, which he was now going to receive.</P>
<P>HE was brought again the next day before the procon&s;ul, who per&s;uaded him not fooli&s;hly to throw away his life, but pre&s;erve it, and enjoy the plea&s;ures of the world. The apo&s;tle told him, that if he would renounce his idolatries and heartily embrace the Chri&s;tian faith, he &s;hould, with him and the members who had believed in the Son of God, receive eternal happine&s;s in the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom. The procon&s;ul an&s;wered, that he him&s;elf &s;hould never embrace the religion he mentioned; and that the only rea|&s;on why he was &s;o earne&s;t with him to &s;acrifice to the gods, was that tho&s;e whom he had every where &s;educed, might, by his example, be brought back to the ancient reli|gion they had for&s;aken. To which the apo&s;tle replied, that he &s;aw it was in vain to endeavour to per&s;uade a per&s;on incapable of &s;ober councils, and hardened in his own blindne&s;s and folly; that with regard to him&s;elf, he might act as he plea&s;ed, and if he had any torment greater than another, he might heap that upon him; as the greater con&s;tancy he &s;hewed in his &s;ufferings for CHRIST, the more acceptable he &s;hould be to his Lord and Ma&s;ter. Aegeas, upon this, immediately pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence of death upon him, not being able to re&s;train his rage any longer.</P>
<P>THE Procon&s;ul fir&s;t ordered St. Andrew to be &s;courged, &s;even lictors &s;ucce&s;&s;ively whip|ping his naked body; and, &s;eeing his invincible patience and con&s;tancy, commanded him to be crucified; but to be fa&s;tened to the cro&s;s with cords in&s;tead of nails, that his death might be more lingering and tedious. As he was led to the place of execution, walking with a cheerful and compo&s;ed mind, the people cried out that a good and in|nocent man was unju&s;tly condemned to die. On his coming near the cro&s;s, he &s;aluted it in the following manner: I have long de&s;ired and expected this happy hour. The cro&s;s has been con&s;ecrated by the body of CHRIST hanging on it, and adorned with his members as with &s;o many ine&s;timable jewels: I therefore come joyfully and triumphing to it, that it may receive me as a di&s;ciple and follower of him who once hung upon it, and be the means of carrying me &s;afe to my Ma&s;ter, being the in&s;trument on which he redeemed me and all his people from everla&s;ting mi&s;ery."</P>
<P>HAVING offered up his prayers to the throne of grace, and exhorted the people to con&s;tancy and per&s;everance in the religion he had delivered to them, he was fa&s;tened to the cro&s;s, on which he hung two whole days, teaching and in&s;tructing the people. In the mean time, great intere&s;t was made to the procon&s;ul to &s;pare his life; but the apo&s;|tle earne&s;tly begged of the Almighty, that he might now depart, and &s;eal the truth of his religion with his blood. His prayers were heard, and he immediately expired on the la&s;t day of November, but in what year is not recorded by hi&s;torians.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="029927_0394_0FE33AC8750862B0">THE cro&s;s on which he &s;uffered, appears to have &s;omething peculiar in the form of it, and is commonly thought to have been a cro&s;s decu&s;&s;ate, or two pieces of timber cro&s;s|ing each other in the form of the letter X, hence u&s;ually known by the name of St. Andrew's cro&s;s; though &s;ome affirm that he &s;uffered death on an Olive-tree, and not on a cro&s;s.</P>
<P>AFTER his body was taken from the cro&s;s, it was decently and honourably intered by Maximilla, a lady of great quality and e&s;tate, and who, Nicephorus tells us, was wife to the procon&s;ul. Con&s;tantine the great afterwards removed his body to Con&s;tan|tinople, and buried it in the great church he had built to the honour of the apo&s;tles: but this &s;tructure being taken down &s;ome hundred of years after, in order to rebuild it, by Ju&s;tinian the emperor, the body of St. Andrew was found in a wooden coffin, and again depo&s;ited in the place where it was at fir&s;t intered.</P>
<P>WE have the following encomia&s;tic character of St. Andrew, from He&s;ychius, pre&s;by|ter of Jeru&s;alem, with which we &s;hall conclude this account of his life. "St. Andrew was the fir&s;t-born of the apo&s;tolic choir, the principal and fir&s;t pillar of the church, <HI>a rock before the rock,</HI> the foundation of that foundation, the fir&s;t fruits of the beginning, a caller before he was called him&s;elf; he preached that go&s;pel which was not yet re|vealed or entertained; he revealed and made known that life to his brother, which he had not yet perfectly learned him&s;elf: &s;o great trea&s;ures did that one que&s;tion bring him, <HI>Ma&s;ter, where dwelle&s;t thou?</HI> which he &s;oon perceived by the an&s;wer, <HI>Come and &s;ee.</HI> How art thou become a prophet? whence thus divinely &s;kilful? what is it that thou &s;ounde&s;t in Peter's ears. <HI>We have found him of whom Mo&s;es and the prophets did write,</HI> &amp;c. Why do&s;t thou attempt to compa&s;s him whom thou can&s;t not comprehend? how can he be found who is omnipre&s;ent? But he knew very well what he &s;aid, we have found him whom Adam lo&s;t, whom Eve injured, whom the clouds of &s;in have hidden from us, and to whom our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions had hitherto rendered us &s;trangers. Thus had St. Andrew the honour of being the fir&s;t apo&s;tle that preached the go&s;pel of the Son of God; as appears by his declaration recited above."</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW, THE APOSTLE.</HEAD>
<P>WE learn from the evangelical hi&s;tory of the election of the apo&s;tles, that St. Bartholomew was one of the twelve: becau&s;e he is but ju&s;t named, without any further notice taken of him, the generality of writers, ancient and modern, &s;uppo&s;e that he lay concealed under the name of Nathanael, one of the fir&s;t di&s;ciples that came to CHRIST. Accordingly, we may ob&s;erve, that as St. John never mentions Bartholo|mew in the number of the apo&s;tles, &s;o the other evangeli&s;ts take no notice of Nathanael, probably as being the &s;ame per&s;on under two different names: and as in St. John, Phi|lip and Nathanael are joined together in their coming to CHRIST; &s;o in the re&s;t of the evangeli&s;ts, Philip and Bartholomew are con&s;tantly put together; certainly for no other rea&s;on, than becau&s;e they were jointly called to the di&s;ciple&s;hip: but what renders this opinion &s;till more probable, is, that Nathanael is particularly mentioned among&s;t the other apo&s;tles, to whom our Lord appeared at the &s;ea of Tiberias after his re&s;urrection.</P>

was of the &s;chool of the Thalmaeans, &s;o called from their founder Thalmaei, &s;cholar to Heber, the ancient ma&s;ter of the Hebrews. Now it was u&s;ual for &s;cholars, out of a great reverence to their ma&s;ter, as fir&s;t in&s;titutor of the order, to adopt his name, as Ben-ezra, Ben-uziel, and the like: but which ever of the&s;e conjectures appears mo&s;t &s;atisfactory to the reader, either will be &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e, namely, to reconcile the difference there &s;eems to be between St. John and the other evangeli&s;ts about the name of this apo&s;tle&punc; the one calling him by his proper name, and the other by his rela|tive or paternal appellation.</P>
<P>ST. Augu&s;tine indeed &s;eemed to object, that it is not probable that our ble&s;&s;ed Savi|our, who propo&s;ed to confound the wi&s;dom of this world by the preaching of illiterate men, would choo&s;e Nathanael, a doctor of the law, to be one of his apo&s;tles: but this objection will appear to be built on a &s;andy foundation, if we con&s;ider, that the &s;ame argument is as &s;trong again&s;t Philip, of who&s;e knowledge in the law and the prophets, there is as &s;trong evidence in the hi&s;tory of the go&s;pel as for that of Nathanael; and may be urged with &s;till greater force again&s;t St. Paul, who&s;e abilities in human learning were remarkably great, and few were more complete ma&s;ters of the Jewi&s;h law, than that great apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>THIS difficulty being removed, we &s;hall proceed to the hi&s;tory of this apo&s;tle, and con&s;ider the names of Nathanael and Bartholomew as belonging to one and the &s;ame, and not to two per&s;ons.</P>
<P>AS to his de&s;cent and family, &s;ome are of opinion that he was a Syrian, and that he was de&s;cended from the Ptolemies of Egypt; probably for no other rea&s;on than the mere analogy and &s;ound of the name: but it is plain from the evangelical hi&s;tory, that he was a Galilean, St. John having expre&s;sly told us, that Nathanael was of Cana in that part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Judea. His trade and manner of life are not mentioned in Scripture, though from &s;ome circum&s;tances there is room to imagine that he was a fi&s;herman: but however that be, he was at his fir&s;t coming to CHRIST, conducted by Philip, who told him they had now found the long expected Me&s;&s;iah &s;o often foretold by Mo&s;es and the prophets, <HI>Je&s;us of Nazareth, the &s;on of Jo&s;eph.</HI> And when he objected that the Me&s;&s;iah could not be born in Nazareth, Philip de&s;ired him to come and &s;atisfy him&s;elf of the truth.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, on his approach, entertained him with this honourable cha|racter, that he was <HI>an I&s;raelite indeed,</HI> a man of true &s;implicity and dignity; and indeed his &s;implicity particularly appears in this, that when he was told of JESUS, he did not object again&s;t the meanne&s;s of his original, the low condition of his parents, or the narrowne&s;s of their fortunes, but only again&s;t the place of his birth, which, as he ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, could not be Nazareth, the Scriptures peremptorily foretelling that the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould be born at Bethlehem.</P>
<P>THIS apo&s;tle was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at our Lord's &s;alutation, wondering how he could know him at the fir&s;t &s;ight, being certain he had never before &s;een his face: but he was an&s;wered, that he had &s;een him while he was yet under the fig-tree, even before Philip called him. Convinced by this in&s;tance of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lord's divinity, he pre&s;ently made this confe&s;&s;ion, that he was now &s;ure that JESUS was the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, the Son of God, whom he had appointed to govern his church. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour told him, that if, from this in&s;tance, he could believe him to be the Me&s;&s;iah, he &s;hould have far greater arguments to confirm his faith; for that he &s;hould hereafter behold the heavens opened
<PB N="373" REF="029927_0396_0FE33AD35ADCCCF0">
to receive him, and the angels vi&s;ibly appearing to attend his triumphant entrance into the heaven of heavens.</P>
<P>AFTER the vi&s;ible de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t on the apo&s;tles, St. Bartholomew vi&s;ited different parts of the world to preach the go&s;pel, and penetrated as far as the hither In|dia. Having &s;pent a con&s;iderable time there, and in the ea&s;tern extremities of A&s;ia, he returned to the northern and we&s;tern parts: and we find him at Hierapolis in Phry|gia, labouring in concert with St. Philip, to plant Chri&s;tianity in tho&s;e parts, and to convince the blind idolaters of the evil of their ways, and direct them in the paths that lead to the regions of felicity. This enraged the bigotted magi&s;trates, and he was, together with St. Philip, de&s;igned for Martyrdom; and in order to this fa&s;tened to a cro&s;s: but a &s;udden trembling and motion of the earth convinced the idolaters that the ju&s;tice of Omnipotence would revenge their deaths; &s;o that they took him immediately down from the cro&s;s and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>ST. BARTHOLOMEW pa&s;&s;ed from hence into Lycaonia, and St. Chry&s;o&s;tom a&s;&s;ures us, that he in&s;tructed and trained up the inhabitants in the Chri&s;tian di&s;cipline. His la&s;t remove was to Adrianople in Great Armenia, a place mi&s;erably over-run with idolatry, from which he laboured to reclaim the people: but his endeavours to <HI>turn them from darkne&s;s unto light; and from the power of Satan unto God,</HI> were &s;o far from having the de&s;ired effect, that it provoked the magi&s;trates, who prevailed on the governor to put him to death, which he cheerfully underwent, &s;ealing with his blood the truth of the doctrine he had preached.</P>
<P>WE are told by &s;ome of the ancients, that he was crucified with his head downwards; and by others, that he was flayed alive. Perhaps he &s;uffered both; for Plutarch records a particular in&s;tance of Me&s;obates, the Per&s;ian eunuch, who was fir&s;t flayed alive, and then crucified; and the inhabitants of Adrianople might ea&s;ily borrow this barbarous and inhuman cruelty from the Per&s;ians, who were remarkably &s;evere in their puni&s;h|ments.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF ST. BARNABAS, THE APOSTLE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS apo&s;tle was at fir&s;t called Jo&s;es, a &s;ofter termination generally given by the Greeks to Jo&s;eph; his fellow di&s;ciples added the name of Barnabas, as &s;ignificant of &s;ome extraordinary property in him. St. Luke interprets it, <HI>the &s;on of con&s;olation,</HI> which he was ever ready to admini&s;ter to the afflicted, both by word and action; as his com|fortable di&s;cour&s;es, his &s;elling his own e&s;tate, and collecting the benevolence of others, for the relief of the poor indigent Chri&s;tians, abundantly te&s;tify. St. Jerom ob&s;erves that his name al&s;o denotes <HI>the &s;on of a prophet:</HI> and in this re&s;pect likewi&s;e it was well &s;uited to our apo&s;tle, as being eminent for his endowments and prophetic gifts.</P>
<P>ST. BARNABAS was a de&s;cendant of the tribe of Levi, of a family removed out of Judea, and &s;ettled in the i&s;le of Cyprus, where they had purcha&s;ed an e&s;tate, as the Le|vites might do out of their country. His parents finding their &s;on of a promi&s;ing geni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and di&s;po&s;ition, placed him in one of the &s;chools of Jeru&s;alem, under the tuition of Ga|maliel, and St. Paul's ma&s;ter; a circum&s;tance which, in all probability, laid the fir&s;t foundation for that intimacy which afterwards &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the&s;e two eminent &s;ervants of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="029927_0397_0FE33AD4E1326DA8">ST. BARNABAS is fir&s;t mentioned in the Holy Scripture, in record of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> great and worthy &s;ervice he did the church of CHRIST, by &s;ecuring it with the &s;ale of his pa|trimony in Cyprus, the whole price of which he laid at the apo&s;tle's feet, to be put into the common &s;tock, and di&s;po&s;ed of as they &s;hould think fit, among&s;t the indigent fol|lowers of the Holy JESUS. This worthy example was followed by tho&s;e who were ble&s;|&s;ed with the goods of fortune; none kept their plenty to them&s;elves, but turned their hou&s;es and lands into money, and devoted it to the common u&s;e of the church. St. Barnabas is indeed mentioned as &s;elling the mo&s;t valuable e&s;tate on this occa&s;ion; or being the mo&s;t forward and ready to begin a common &s;tock and &s;et others a laudable pattern of charity and benevolence to the brethern.</P>
<P>OUR apo&s;tle now became con&s;iderable in the mini&s;try and government of the church; for we find that St. Paul coming to Jeru&s;alem three years after his conver&s;ion, and not readily procuring admittance into the church, becau&s;e he had been &s;o grievous a per&s;ecuter of it, and might &s;till be &s;u&s;pected of a de&s;ign to betray it, he addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf to Barnabas as a leading man among&s;t the Chri&s;tians, and one that had per&s;onal knowledge of him. He accordingly introduced him to Peter and James and &s;atisfied them of the &s;incerity of his conver&s;ion, and in what a miraculous manner it was brought about.</P>
<P>THE agreeable news was brought to Jeru&s;alem, about four or five years after|wards that &s;everal of their body, who had been driven out of Judea by the per|&s;ecutions rai&s;ed about St. Stephen, had preached at Antioch with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that a great number, both of Jews and pro&s;elytes, embraced Chri&s;tianity, and were de&s;irous that &s;ome of the &s;uperior order would come down and confirm them. This reque&s;t was immediately granted; and Barnabas was deputed to &s;ettle this new plan|tation. Upon his arrival, he rejoiced extremely, to &s;ee what progre&s;s the go&s;pel had made among&s;t them; and earne&s;tly exhorted them to continue immoveable in their pro|fe&s;&s;ion of CHRIST JESUS. And being him&s;elf a good man, and full of the Holy Gho&s;t; and of faith, his charitable deeds accompanying his di&s;cour&s;es, and his pious life exem|plifying his &s;ound doctrine, the people were greatly influenced by him, and very large additions were made to the Chri&s;tian church: but there being too large a field for one labourer, he went to fetch Paul from Tar&s;us&punc; who came back with him to Antioch, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him a whole year in e&s;tabli&s;hing that church. Their labours pro&s;pered, their a&s;|&s;emblies were crowded, and the di&s;ciples, who before this were called among&s;t them&s;elves <HI>brethren, believers, elect,</HI> and by their enemies, <HI>Nazare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es,</HI> and <HI>Galileans,</HI> were now called Chri&s;tians fir&s;t in this city.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e apo&s;tles preached in Antioch, Agabus, a prophet, gave the church notice, that there would &s;hortly be a great famine thoughout the Roman empire; e&s;pecially in Judea. On hearing this prophecy, the Chri&s;tians of Antioch con&s;idering the num|ber and nece&s;&s;ities of their brethren at Jeru&s;alem, and how generou&s;ly the rich among&s;t them had exhau&s;ted their e&s;tates in maintaining the poor, determined to &s;end them a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the en&s;uing &s;carcity, which they rai&s;ed by contributions accor|ding to every man's abilities, and &s;ent it to the heads of the church at Jeru&s;alem, by the hands of Barnabas and Paul. This famine lay heavy on Judea, during the four years government of Ca&s;pius Fadus, and Tiberias Alexander, who, under the emperor Claudius, were pre&s;idents of that province.</P>
<P>AFTER the apo&s;tles had fulfilled their charitable emba&s;&s;y, and &s;taid &s;ome time at Jeru|&s;alem to &s;ee the good effect of it, they returned again to Antioch, bringing with them
<PB N="375" REF="029927_0398_0FE33AD6645550B8">
John, who&s;e &s;urname was Mark, the &s;on of Mary, &s;i&s;ter to Barnabas; and at who&s;e hou&s;e the di&s;ciples found both &s;ecurity for their per&s;ons, and conveniency for the &s;olem|nities of their wor&s;hip. But &s;oon after the apo&s;tles return to Antioch, an expre&s;s reve|lation was made to the church, by the mouth of one of the prophets who mini&s;tered there, that Barnabas and Paul &s;hould be &s;et apart for an extraordinary work, unto which the Holy Gho&s;t had appointed them. Upon this declaration the church &s;et apart a day for a &s;olemn mi&s;&s;ion, and after devout prayer and fa&s;ting, they laid their hands upon them, and ordained them to their office; which was to travel over certain coun|tries, and preach the go&s;pel to the Gentiles: from this joint commi&s;&s;ion, Barnabas ob|tained the name of an apo&s;tle, not only among&s;t later writers of the church, but with St. Paul him&s;elf, and with St. Luke, in the hi&s;tory of the acts of the apo&s;tles written by him.</P>
<P>BEING thus con&s;ecrated <HI>the apo&s;tles of the Gentiles,</HI> they entered upon their mini&s;try, taking with them John Mark for their mini&s;ter or deacon, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in many eccle&s;ia&s;tical offices, particularly in taking care of the poor and receiving contributions for them.</P>
<P>AFTER their departure from Antioch, the fir&s;t city they vi&s;ited was Selucia, a city of Syria, adjoining to the &s;ea; from whence they &s;ailed for the i&s;land of Cyprus, the na|tive place of St. Barnabas, and arrived at Salamis, a port formerly remarkable for its trade. Here they boldly preached the doctrines of the go&s;pel, in the &s;ynagogue of the Jews; and from thence travelled to Paphos, the capital of the i&s;land. Here their preach|ing was attended with remarkable &s;ucce&s;s; Servius Paulus, the procon&s;ul, being, among&s;t others, converted to the faith of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>HAVING quitted Cyprus, they cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to preach in Pamphyli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, were their deacon John, to the great grief of his uncle Barnabas, left them&punc; and returned to Jeru&s;alem. The apo&s;tles afterwards went to Perga, where they did not continue long, but travelled &s;eventy or eighty miles northward to Antioch in Pi&s;idia&punc; &s;o called to di&s;tingui&s;h it from Antioch in Syria, where the apo&s;tles received their ordination. Here they preached to the Jews in their &s;ynagogue; but meeting with bla&s;phemous oppo&s;ition, they told them plainly, that they thought it rea&s;onable to preach the go&s;|pel fir&s;t to them; but as they had &s;o unthankfully rejected it, they would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> make the &s;ame offers of &s;alvation to the Gentiles, according to the commandment of God, by his prophets; but the exa&s;perated Jews &s;tirred up &s;ome of the principal citizens to per|&s;ecute them, and force them to leave the city; whereupon they departed from Antioch&punc; and came to Iconium, the metropolis of Lycaonia, where they continued a con&s;iderable time, preaching in the &s;ynagogues with great &s;ucce&s;s: but, at la&s;t, the old &s;pirit of Jewi&s;h rage and malice prevailed again&s;t them, and obliged them, in order to avoid the madne&s;s of the multitude, to retire to Derbe, a city of Lycaonia.</P>
<P>THEY returned from Derbe to Ly&s;tra, Iconium, and Antioch in Pi&s;idi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <HI>con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the &s;ouls of the di&s;ciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith; and that we mu&s;t through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</HI> After a &s;hort &s;tay, they again vi&s;ited the churches of Pamphylia, Perga, and Attalia, were they took &s;hip and &s;ailed to Antioch in Syria, the place from whence they fir&s;t &s;et out. Pre&s;ently after their arrival, they called the church of this city together, and gave them an account of their travel, and of the great &s;ucce&s;s which had attended their preaching in the Gentile world.</P>
<P>THEY had not long continued in this city, before their a&s;&s;i&s;tance was required to com|po&s;e a difference in this church, occa&s;ioned by &s;ome of the Jewi&s;h converts, who
<PB N="376" REF="029927_0399_0FE33AE28A79C728">
endeavoured to per&s;uade the Gentiles that they were bound to ob&s;erve the law of Mo&s;es, as well as that of CHRIST; and be circumci&s;ed as well as baptized. Barnabas endea|voured to per&s;uade the zealots from pre&s;&s;ing &s;uch unnece&s;&s;ary ob&s;ervations; but all his endeavours proving ineffectual, he was deputed with St. Paul and others, to go to the church at Jeru&s;alem, to &s;ubmit the que&s;tion to be determined there in a full a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>DURING their &s;tay at Jeru&s;alem, Mark, in all probability, reconciled him&s;elf to his uncle Barnabas, and returned with him and St. Paul to Antioch, after they had &s;ucceed|ed in their bu&s;ine&s;s at Jeru&s;alem, and obtained a decree from the &s;ynod there, that the Gentile converts &s;hould not have circumci&s;ion and other Mo&s;aic rites impo&s;ed upon them, as they were now under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>THE minds of the Gentiles were greatly quieted and comforted by this determina|tion; neverthele&s;s it did not prevent the bigotted Jews from keeping up a &s;eparation from them; and that with &s;o much ob&s;tinacy, that when St. Peter &s;ome time after came to Antioch, he, for fear of offending them, contradicted his former practice, and late &s;peech and vote in the &s;ynod of Jeru&s;alem, by refraining from all kind of communion with the Gentiles; and Barnabas him&s;elf, though &s;o great and good a man, was induced, by the authority of his example, to commit the &s;ame error; though doubtle&s;s, on being reproved by St. Paul, they both took more courage, and walked according to that true liberty and freedom which the go&s;pel imparts.</P>
<P>AFTER this tran&s;action, Paul made a propo&s;al to Barnabas, that they &s;hould repeat their late travels among&s;t the Gentiles, and &s;ee how the churches they had planted in|crea&s;ed in their numbers, and improved in the doctrines they had taught them. Bar|nabas very readily complied with the propo&s;al, but de&s;ired they might take with them this reconciled nephew, John Mark. This Paul ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, becau&s;e in their former voyage, Mark had not &s;hewn the con&s;tancy of a faithful mini&s;ter of CHRIST, but con&s;ulted his own ea&s;e at a dangerous juncture, departed from them without leave at Pamphylia, and returned to Jeru&s;alem. Barnabas &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on taking him, and the other continuing as re&s;olute to oppo&s;e it, a &s;hort debate aro&s;e, which terminated in a rupture; whereby the&s;e two holy men, who had for &s;everal years been companions in the mini&s;try, and with united endeavours propagated the go&s;pel of the Son of God, now took different provinces. Barnabas, with his kin&s;man, failed to his own country, Cy|prus; and Paul travelled to the churches of Syria and Cilicia, taking Silas with him.</P>
<P>THE &s;acred writers give us no account of St. Barnabas, after his &s;eparation from St. Paul; nor are the eccle&s;ia&s;tical writers agreed among&s;t them&s;elves with regard to the actions of our apo&s;tle, after his &s;ailing for Cyprus: this however &s;eems to be certain, that he did not &s;pend the whole remainder of his life in that i&s;land, but vi&s;ited different parts of the world, preaching the glad-tidings of the go&s;pel, healing the &s;ick, and working other miracles among&s;t the Gentiles; and after long and painful travels, at|tended with different degrees of &s;ucce&s;s in different places, he returned to Cyprus, his native country, where he &s;uffered martyrdom in the following manner: certain Jews coming from Syria to Salamis, where Barnabas was then preaching the go&s;pel, were highly exa&s;perated at his extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s, fell upon him as he was di&s;puting in the &s;ynagogue, dragged him out, and after the mo&s;t inhuman tortures, &s;toned him to death. His kin&s;man John Mark, who was a &s;pectator of this barbarous action, privately interred his body in a cave, where it remained till the time of the emperor Zeno, in the year of CHRIST 485, when it was di&s;covered laying on his brea&s;t, with St. Matthew's go&s;pel in Hebrew, written with his own hand.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF ST. PHILIP, THE APOSTLE.</HEAD>
<P>ST. PHILIP was a native of Beth&s;aida, the city of Andrew and Peter. He had the honour of being fir&s;t called to be a di&s;ciple of the great Me&s;&s;iah, which happened in the following manner. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, &s;oon after his return from the wilder|ne&s;s, where he had been tempted by the devil, met with Andrew and his brother Peter, and after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e parted from them. The next day, as he was pa&s;&s;ing through Galilee, he found Philip, whom he pre&s;ently commanded to follow him, the con&s;tant form he made u&s;e of in calling his di&s;ciples, and tho&s;e that in&s;eparably attended him; &s;o that the prerogative of being fir&s;t called, evidently belongs to St. Philip, he being the fir&s;t of our Lord's di&s;ciples; for though Andrew and St. John were the fir&s;t that came and conver&s;ed with the Saviour of the world, yet they immediately returned to their occupation, and were not called till a whole year afterwards.</P>
<P>OUR apo&s;tle was not idle after the honour he had received of being called to attend the Saviour of the world; he immediately imparted the glad-tidings of the Me&s;&s;iah's appearance to his brother Nathanael, and conducted him to JESUS: &s;o ready is a good man to conduct others in the paths that lead to happine&s;s and peace.</P>
<P>WE have very little recorded of St. Philip by the evangeli&s;t, after his being called to the apo&s;tle&s;hip. It was, however, to him that our Saviour propo&s;ed the que&s;tion, where they &s;hould find bread &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the hunger of &s;o great a multitude? To which Philip an&s;wered, that it was not ea&s;y to procure &s;o large a quantity; not con&s;idering, that it was equally ea&s;y for Almighty power to feed double the number, when it plea&s;ed to exert it&s;elf. It was al&s;o to the &s;ame apo&s;tle, that the Gentile pro&s;elytes, who came up to wor&s;hip at Jeru&s;alem, applied, when they were de&s;irous to &s;ee the Saviour of the world: and it was with him our Lord had the di&s;cour&s;e a little before the pa&s;chal &s;up|per, when he was going about to &s;uffer.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="029927_0402_0FE33AE74BCAEBC0">WHILE the holy compa&s;&s;ionate JESUS was fortifying the minds of his di&s;ciples with proper con&s;iderations again&s;t his departure from them, and had told them, a place in the man&s;ions of the heavenly Canaan: that he was <HI>the way, truth, and the life: that no man could come to the Father but by him, and that knowing him, they both knew and had &s;een the Father:</HI> Philip, not thoroughly under&s;tanding the force of his Ma&s;ter's rea&s;onings begged of him that he would &s;hew them the Father. We can hardly &s;uppo&s;e that Phi|lip &s;hould have &s;uch gro&s;s conceptions of the Deity, as to imagine the Father inve&s;ted with a corporeal and vi&s;ible nature; but CHRIST having told them that they had &s;een him, and knowing that of old, God frequently appeared in a vi&s;ible &s;hape, he only de|&s;ired that he would manife&s;t him&s;elf to them by &s;ome &s;uch appearance. Our Lord gently reproved his ignorance, that after attending &s;o long to his in&s;tructions, he &s;hould know, that he was the image of his Father, the expre&s;s characters of his infinite wi&s;|dom, power and goodne&s;s, appearing in him; that he &s;aid and did nothing but by his Father's appointment, which, if they did not believe, his miracles were a &s;ufficient evi|dence; that &s;uch demands were therefore unnece&s;&s;ary and impertinent; and that it was an indication of great weakne&s;s in him, after three years education under his di&s;cipline and in&s;titution, to appear &s;o ignorant with regard to the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>WE are told by the ancients, that in the di&s;tribution made by the apo&s;tles of the &s;everal regions of the world, the upper A&s;ia fell to the &s;hare of St. Philip, where he ap|plied him&s;elf with an indefatigable diligence and indu&s;try, to turn the children of men from the paths of wickedne&s;s which lead to de&s;truction, to the ways that terminate in eternal felicity: and by the con&s;tancy and power of his preaching, and the efficacy of his maricles, he gained numerous converts, whom he bapti&s;ed into the Chri&s;tian faith, curing at once their bodies of infirmities and di&s;tempers, and their &s;ouls of error and idolatry, he continued with them a con&s;iderable time in &s;ettling churches, and appointing them &s;piritual guides and mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;everal years &s;ucce&s;sfully exerci&s;ed his apo&s;tolical office in all tho&s;e parts, he came at la&s;t to Hierapolis in Phrygia, a city remarkable rich and populous, but at the &s;ame time over-run with the mo&s;t enormous idolatry: among&s;t the many vain and trifling deities, to whom they paid religious adoration, was a &s;erpent or dragon, of an enor|mous magnitude which they wor&s;hipped with the mo&s;t &s;olemn reverence and devotion.</P>
<P>BEING grieved to &s;ee the people &s;o wretchedly en&s;laved by error and &s;uper&s;tition, St. Philip continually offered his addre&s;&s;es to heaven, till by his prayers, and often calling upon the name of CHRIST, he procured the death, or, at lea&s;t, the vani&s;hing of this famous and beloved &s;erpent. Having thus demoli&s;hed their deity, he demon&s;trated to them, how rediculous and unju&s;t it was for them to pay divine honours to &s;uch odious crea|tures, &s;hewed them, that God alone was to be wor&s;hipped as the great Parent of all the world, who, in the beginning made man after his glorious image, and when fallen from that innocent and happy &s;tate, &s;ent his own Son into the world to redeem him; that, in order to perform this glorious work, he died on the cro&s;s, and ro&s;e again from the dead, and at the end of the world will come again to rai&s;e all the &s;ons of men from the cham|bers of the du&s;t, and &s;entence them to everla&s;ting rewards and puni&s;hments, according to their works. This di&s;cou&s;e rou&s;ed them from their lethargy; &s;o that great numbers were a&s;hamed of their late idolatry, and embraced the doctrines of the go&s;pel with ear|ne&s;tne&s;s and &s;incerity.</P>
<P>THE great enemy of mankind, being provoked at this &s;ucce&s;s had recour&s;e to his old methods, cruelty and per&s;ecution. The magi&s;trates of the city &s;eized the apo&s;tle, and
<PB N="379" REF="029927_0403_0FE33AEEB10F4BB0">
having thrown him into pri&s;on, cau&s;ed him to be &s;everely &s;courged. When this pre|paratory cruelty was over, he was led to execution, and, being bound, was hanged again&s;t a pillar; or, according to others, crucified: but Omnipotence did not behold this &s;cene of cruelty without te&s;tifying his anger; for when this indefatigable apo&s;tle was expiring, the earth began &s;uddenly to quake, and the ground whereon the people &s;tood to &s;ink under them; but, on their con&s;idering it as a mark of the divine ven|geance, and imploring pardon for their crime, it &s;uddenly &s;topt, and returned to its former po&s;ition. The apo&s;tle being dead, his body was taken down by St. Bartholo|mew, his fellow-labourer in the go&s;pel, and Mariamne, St. Philip's &s;i&s;ter, the con&s;tant companions of his travels, and decently buried; after which they confirmed the people in the faith of CHRIST, and departed from tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>THE ancient writers unanimou&s;ly agree that he was a married man; and Clemens of Alexandria, that he had daughters, whom he di&s;po&s;ed of in marriage: but he, not care|fully di&s;tingui&s;hing between Philip the deacon, who lived at Ce&s;area, with his three vir|gin daughters, as mentioned in the acts of the apo&s;tles, has cau&s;ed &s;ome confu&s;ion among&s;t the ancient authors: nay, &s;ome have concluded, that they were one and the &s;ame per&s;on; though the one was called to the apo&s;tle&s;hip by our Lord him&s;elf, and the other only a deacon cho&s;en by the apo&s;tles at Jeru&s;alem, after the de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t upon them.</P>
<P>IT does not appear that St. Philip left any writings behind him, being fully employed in mini&s;teries more immediately u&s;eful to the happine&s;s of mankind as an apo&s;tle.</P>

<HEAD>ST. SIMON, THE APOSTLE, SURNAMED THE ZEALOT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS apo&s;tle was, as &s;ome think, one of the four brothers of our Saviour, &s;ons of Jo&s;eph by his former marriage; though the only proof of it is, that one of the&s;e was called Simon, too weak an argument to found any on, except a bare conjecture. In the catalogue of the apo&s;tles, he is &s;tyled <HI>Simon the Canaanite,</HI> whence &s;ome conjec|ture he was born in Cana of Galilee, and others will have him to have been the bride|groom mentioned by St. John, at who&s;e marriage our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour turned the water into wine: but this word has no relation to his country, or the place of his nativity, be|ing derived from the Hebrew word <HI>knah,</HI> which &s;ignifies zeal; and denote a warm and &s;prightly temper. What &s;ome of the evangeli&s;ts, therefore, call <HI>Canaanite,</HI> others rendering the Hebrew by the Greek word, &s;tyle <HI>Zealot:</HI> not from his great zeal, his ardent affection to his Ma&s;ter, and a de&s;ire of advancing his religion in the world, but from his warm active temper, and zealous forwardne&s;s in &s;ome part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cular &s;ect of reli|gion, before our Saviour called him to be a di&s;ciple.</P>
<P>THAT we may under&s;tand this the better it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that as there were &s;everal &s;ects and parties among&s;t the Jews, &s;o there was one, either a di&s;tinct &s;ect, or, at lea&s;t, a branch of the Phari&s;ees, called the &s;ect of the Zealots: they were remark|able a&s;&s;ertors of the honour of the law, and of the &s;trictne&s;s and purity of religion, a&s;&s;uming a liberty to them&s;elves of que&s;tioning notorious offenders, without &s;taying for the ordinary formalities of law; nay, they did not &s;cruple, when they thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to inflict capital puni&s;hments upon them: thus, when a bla&s;phemer cur&s;ed God by the name of an idol, the Zealot who fir&s;t met him had the liberty of killing him, without carrying him before the Sanhedrim. They con&s;idered them&s;elves as the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors of Phineas, who in defence of the honour of God, inflicted death on Zimri and Cozbi: an act which was <HI>counted unto him for righteou&s;ne&s;s unto all generations f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r

<P>WHATEVER St. Simon was before, we can have no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, but that after his conver&s;ion he was very zealous for the honour of his ma&s;ter, and con&s;idered all tho&s;e who were enemies to CHRIST, as enemies to him&s;elf, how near &s;oever they might be to him in any natural relation: and he was very exact in all the practical duties of the Chri&s;tian religion, &s;o he &s;hewed a very &s;erious and pious indignation towards tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed religion, and a faith in CHRIST, with their mouths, but di&s;honoured their &s;acred profe&s;&s;ion, by their irregular and vicious lives, as many of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians really did, and became heretics and apo&s;tates.</P>
<P>WE are told by Theodoret, that St. Simon the Zealot was of the tribe of Zebulon or Naphthali, and that by this particular he was di&s;tingui&s;hed from St. Simon, a relation of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and after St. James, bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem, who was of the tribe of Judah; but there are &s;tronger rea&s;ons to prove this difference, the authority of Eu&s;ebius, who never calls Simon bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem, an apo&s;tle, but &s;ays expre&s;sly, that the apo&s;|tolic age ended with his death, who died before Simon, bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>IT appears that St. Simon continued in communion with the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles and di&s;ciples at Jeru&s;alem; and at the fea&s;t of Penteco&s;t, received the &s;ame miraculous gift of the Holy Gho&s;t: &s;o that he was qualified with the re&s;t of his brethren for the apo&s;to|lic office, in propagating the go&s;pel of the &s;on of God; and we cannot doubt of his exerci&s;ing his gifts with the &s;ame zeal and fidelity, though in what part of the world, is uncertain, &s;ome &s;ay he went into Egypt, Cyrene, and Africa, preaching the go&s;pel to the inhabitants of tho&s;e remote and barbarous countries: and others add, that after he had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed through tho&s;e burning wa&s;tes, he took &s;hip, and vi&s;ited the frozen regions of the North, preaching the go&s;pel to the inhabitants of the we&s;tern parts, and even in Britain it&s;elf, where having converted great multitudes, and &s;u&s;tained the greate&s;t hard|&s;hips and per&s;ecutions, he was at length crucified, and buried in &s;ome part of Great Britain, but the particular &s;pot cannot be a&s;certained.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF ST. MATTHIAS THE APOSTLE.</HEAD>
<P>ST. MATTHIAS not being an apo&s;tle of the fir&s;t election, immediately called and cho&s;en by the Son of God him&s;elf, it cannot be expected that any account of him can be found in the evangelical hi&s;tory. He was one of our Lord's di&s;ciples, probably one of the &s;eventy, that had attended on him the whole time of his public mini&s;try, and after his death was elected into the apo&s;tolate, to &s;upply the place of Judas, who, after betraying his great Lord and Ma&s;ter, laid violent hands on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>AS the defection of Judas had made a vacancy in the apo&s;tolic college, the fir&s;t thing the di&s;ciples did, after their return from Mount Olivet, when their great Ma&s;ter a&s;cended to the throne of glory, was to fill up this vacancy with a proper per&s;on. Accordingly, Peter acquainted them that Judas, according to the prophetical prediction, being fallen from his mini&s;try, it was nece&s;&s;ary that another &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted in his room, and at the &s;ame time requi&s;ite, that the per&s;on elected &s;hould have been a con&s;tant attendant on the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, that he might be the better qualified for bearing witne&s;s to his life, death, re&s;urrection, a&s;cen&s;ion, and interce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="029927_0405_0FE33AF281A3E430">ST. PETER having thus addre&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly, two per&s;ons were propo&s;ed, namely, Jo&s;eph called Bar&s;abas, and Matthias, both of whom were duly qualified for that impor|tant office. The method of election was by lots, a way common both among&s;t the Jews and Gentiles for determining doubtful and difficult ca&s;es, e&s;pecially in choo&s;ing judges or magi&s;trates; and this cour&s;e &s;eems to have been taken by the apo&s;tles, becau&s;e the Holy Gho&s;t was not yet given, by who&s;e immediate dictates and in&s;pirations they were after|wards chiefly guided.</P>
<P>THAT the bu&s;ine&s;s might proceed with the greater alacrity and &s;ucce&s;s, they fir&s;t &s;o|lemnly made their addre&s;&s;es to heaven, that the omni&s;cient Being, who governed the world, and perfectly under&s;tood the tempers and di&s;po&s;itions of men, would immediately guide and direct the choice, and &s;hew them which of the two he would appoint to take that part of the apo&s;tolic charge, from which Judas had &s;o lately fallen. The prayer being ended, the lots were drawn, by which it appeared that Matthias was the per&s;on, and he was numbered among&s;t the twelve apo&s;tles accordingly.</P>
<P>SOON after this election, the promi&s;ed powers of the Holy Gho&s;t were conferred upon the apo&s;tles, to qualify them for that great and arduous employment upon which they were &s;ent, the e&s;tabli&s;hing the holy religion of the Son of God among&s;t the children of men, in various parts of the world.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t years of the mini&s;try of St. Matthias, was &s;pent in Judea, where he reaped a very con&s;iderable harve&s;t of &s;ouls, and then travelled into different parts of the world, to publi&s;h the glad-tidings of &s;alvation to people who had never yet heard of our Saviour: but the particular parts he vi&s;ited, are not certainly known. The Greeks &s;uppo&s;e, that he travelled ea&s;tward; St. Jerom, &s;ays, his principal re&s;idence was near the influx of the river Ap&s;us into the haven of Hy&s;cus in Cappadocia: but the people were remark|ably rough and uncivilized, &s;o that it is no wonder that he at la&s;t fell a victim to their ferocity; though this did not happen till after he had long indefatigably laboured in the vineyard of his great Ma&s;ter, and brought over va&s;t numbers to an acknowledgment and reception of the truth.</P>
<P>WE are not told by what kind of death this apo&s;tle left the regions of mortality, and &s;ealed the truth of the go&s;pel he had &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly preached with his blood. Dorotheus &s;ays, he fini&s;hed his cour&s;e at Seba&s;tople, and was buried their near the temple of the &s;un. An ancient martyrologi&s;t reports him to have been &s;eized by the Jews, and as a bla&s;phemer, to have been &s;toned, and then beheaded: but the Greek offices, &s;upported herein by &s;everal ancient breviaries, tell us, that he was crucified. His body is by &s;ome pretended to be now at Rome, where &s;ome relics of it are &s;hewn with great veneration; while others contend, that it is at Triers in Germany. Bollandus is of opinion, that the body of Matthias, now at Rome, is that of Matthias, who was bi&s;hop of Jeru&s;alem in the year 120, and who&s;e hi&s;tory they have confounded with that of the apo&s;tle St. Matthias; but Popi&s;h legends and traditions are in no in&s;tance to be relied on.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE VIRGIN MARY, MOTHER OF JESUS.</HEAD>
<P>WE are taught by the predictions of the prophets, that a virgin was to be the mo|ther of the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, and we are al&s;o a&s;&s;ured by the unanimous concur|rence of the evangeli&s;ts, that this virgin's name was Mary, the daughter of Joachim and Anne, of the tribe of Judah, and married to Jo&s;eph of the &s;ame tribe. The Scripture indeed tells us no more of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin's parents, than that &s;he was of the family of
<PB N="382" REF="029927_0406_0FE33AF4038B68E0">
David, and of the town of Bethlehem; not &s;o much as their names being mentioned, unle&s;s by Heli, in St. Luke's genealogy we under&s;tand Joachim the virgin's father. All that is &s;aid concerning the birth of Mary and her parents, is to be found only in &s;ome apocryphal writings; and which however are very ancient. St. John &s;ays that Mary the wife of Cleophas, who was the mother of tho&s;e which the go&s;pel &s;tyles our Lord's brethren, was the virgin's &s;i&s;ter. Mary then was of the royal race of David; &s;he was allied likewi&s;e to the family of Aaron, &s;ince Elizabeth the wife of Zacharias, and mother of John the Bapti&s;t, was the cou&s;in of Mary.</P>
<P>IN conformity to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Greek church, the Latins have for &s;ome centuries pa&s;t honoured St. Joachim as the father of St. Anne, the mother of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin; and though God hath not been plea&s;ed to acquaint us with the particulars of her birth; yet the Roman church, from a grateful &s;en&s;e of the infinite ble&s;&s;ings conveyed to us by the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, hath long celebrated her conception on the eighth of December in the We&s;t, and on the ninth in the Ea&s;t, and her nativity on the eighth of September. An anniver&s;ary fe&s;|tival of her repre&s;entation in the temple is kept likewi&s;e on the twenty-fir&s;t of Novem|ber; and it is commonly believed, that &s;he was con&s;ecrated to God at three years of age: but not to build upon uncertainties, thus much we are a&s;&s;ured by the te&s;timony of an angel, that &s;he was happy above all other women in the divine favour; that &s;he was full of grace; and that the Lord was in a peculiar manner with her.</P>
<P>WHETHER the holy virgin immediately after the annunciation, went up to the pa&s;&s;over at Jeru&s;alem [as &s;ome have imagined, this being the &s;ea&s;on of the year for it] or not, we have no account from the evangeli&s;t St. Luke: but this he a&s;&s;ures us that a little while after &s;he &s;et out for Hebron, a city in the mountains of Judah in order to vi&s;it her cou&s;in Elizabeth, to congratulate her upon her pregnancy, which &s;he had learned from the angel, at an age when &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing was not u&s;ually to be expected.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner had Mary entered the hou&s;e, and began to &s;peak, than, upon Elizabeth's hearing the voice of her cou&s;in's &s;alutation, her child, young John the Bapti&s;t, tran&s;|ported with &s;upernatural emotions of joy, leaped in her womb: where upon &s;he was filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, and being by divine in&s;piration acquainted with the my&s;tery of the incarnation, &s;he re-&s;aluted Mary, and cried out. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed art thou among&s;t women, and ble&s;&s;ed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord &s;hould come to me? For lo, as &s;oon as the voice of thy &s;alutation &s;ounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. And ble&s;&s;ed is &s;he that believed: for there &s;hall be a performance of tho&s;e things which were told her from the Lord.</HI> Then Mary, filled with acknowledg|ments and &s;upernatural light, prai&s;ed God, &s;aying, <HI>My &s;oul doth magnify the Lord, and my &s;pirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>MARY having continued here about three months, till Elizabeth was delivered as St. Ambro&s;e thinks, that &s;he might &s;ee him on who&s;e account &s;he principally made that vi&s;it, returned afterwards to her own hou&s;e at Nazareth, waiting for the time of her delivery: but when &s;he was ready to be delivered, an edict was publi&s;hed by Cae&s;ar Augu&s;tus, in the year of the world 4000, the fir&s;t of CHRIST, and the third before the vulgar Aera; which decreed, that all the &s;ubjects of the Roman empire &s;hould go to the re&s;pective cities and places; there to have their names regi&s;tered according to their families. Thus Jo&s;eph and Mary, who were both of the lineage of David, repaired to their city of Bethlehem, the original and native place of their family: but while they were in this city, the time being fulfilled in which Mary was to be delivered, &s;he brought forth her fir&s;t-born &s;on, wrapped him in &s;waddling-clothes and laid him in the manger
<PB N="383" REF="029927_0407_0FE33B005C3AE5F0">
of the &s;table, whither they had retired; for they could find no place in public inn, becau&s;e of the great concour&s;e of people that were then at Bethlehem on the &s;ame oc|ca&s;ion; or they were forced to withdraw into the &s;table of the inn, not being able to get a more convenient place for her to be delivered in.</P>
<P>THE angels made the birth of CHRIST known to the &s;hepherds, who were at this time in the fields near Bethlehem, and who came in the night to &s;ee Mary and Jo&s;eph, and the child lying in the manger, in order to pay him their tribute of adoration. Mary took notice of all the&s;e things, and laid them up in her heart. Some time after came the Magi, or wi&s;e men from the Ea&s;t, and brought to JESUS the my&s;terious pre&s;ents of gold, frankincen&s;e, and myrrh, having been directed thither by a &s;tar which led the way before them to the very hou&s;e where the babe lay. After this, being warned by an angel that appeared to them in a dream, they returned into their own country by a way different from that by which they came, without giving Herod the intelligence he wanted; which he pretended was in order to come and wor&s;hip the babe, though his real de&s;ign was to cut him off, from a jealou&s;y of his rivalling that artful monarch in his &s;overeignty over the Jews.</P>
<P>THE time of Mary's purification being now come, that is, forty days after the birth of JESUS, &s;he went to Jeru&s;alem, to pre&s;ent her &s;on in the temple; and there to offer the &s;acrifice appointed by the law, for the purification of women after child-birth. At that time there was at Jeru&s;alem an old man named Simeon, who was full of the Holy Gho&s;t; and had received a &s;ecret a&s;&s;urance, that he &s;hould not die till he had &s;een CHRIST the Lord: accordingly, he came into the temple by the impul&s;e of the Spirit of God, and taking the child JESUS in his arms, he ble&s;&s;ed the Lord; and then ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mary, &s;aid, <HI>This child is &s;ent for the rai&s;ing and falling of many in I&s;rael; and for a &s;ign which &s;hall be &s;poken again&s;t:</HI> even &s;o far as that thy own &s;oul &s;hall be pierced as with a &s;word, that the &s;ecret thoughts in the hearts of many may be di&s;|covered and laid open.</P>
<P>WHEN Jo&s;eph and Mary were preparing afterwards to return to their own country of Nazareth, the angel of the Lord appeared to Jo&s;eph in a dream, bidding him to retire into Egypt with Mary and the child, becau&s;e Herod had a de&s;ign to de&s;troy JESUS. Jo&s;eph obeyed the admonition, and continued in Egypt till after the death of Herod; when both he and Mary returned to Nazareth not daring to go to Bethlehem, becau&s;e it was in the juri&s;diction of Archelaus, the &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Herod the great who was a cruel prince.</P>
<P>NOW it being the con&s;tant practice of Jo&s;eph and Mary to go every year to Jeru&s;alem, to the fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over: and when JESUS was twelve years of age, they brought him with them to the capital. When the days of the fe&s;tival were ended, they &s;et out on their return home; but the child JESUS continued at Jeru&s;alem, without their perceiv|ing it, and, thinking that he might be with &s;ome of the company, they went on a day's journey; when not finding him among&s;t their acquaintance, they returned to Jeru&s;a|lem, &s;eeking for him: three days after, they found him in the temple, &s;itting among&s;t the doctors, hearing them, and a&s;king them que&s;tions. When they &s;aw him, they were filled with a&s;toni&s;hment; and Mary &s;aid to him, my &s;on, why ha&s;t thou &s;erved us thus? Behold thy father and my&s;elf, who have &s;ought thee in great affliction. JESUS an&s;wer|ed them, Why did you &s;eek me?

<P><PB N="384" REF="029927_0408_0FE33B01E1E58D20">THE ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, in the thirtieth year of the vulgar aera, re&s;olved to manife&s;t him|&s;elf to the world, and, therefore, went to be bapti&s;ed by St. John, from thence into the wilderne&s;s, and thence to the above-mentioned wedding, to which he, with his mother and di&s;ciples, had been invited. At this entertainment, the provi&s;ion of wine being &s;omewhat &s;canty (probably becau&s;e the friends of the married couple were but mean) CHRIST's mother told her &s;on, they had no wine, not doubting of his power to &s;upply them: to which JESUS an&s;wered in terms which had &s;ome appearance of a rebuke, <HI>Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</HI></P>
<P>SIX great &s;tone pitchers being in the room, JESUS ordered them to be filled brim|full of water; and afterwards commanded the &s;ervants to fill out and carry it to the ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t, who, on ta&s;ting it, found it to be excellent wine. This is the fir&s;t miracle JESUS wrought at the beginning of his public mini&s;try; and from hence our Lord went to Capernaum with his mother and brethren.</P>
<P>IT is true, we learn from the third chapter of St. Mark, that on a certain day in the year of CHTIST thirty-four, and vulgar aera thirty-one, that as JESUS CHRIST was teach|ing in a hou&s;e at Capernaum, &s;o great a crowd of people &s;tood about him, that neither he nor his di&s;ciples had time to take any refre&s;hment; which cau&s;ed a report to be &s;pread abroad, that he had fainted away, or fallen into a &s;woon. The virgin and the brethren or relations of JESUS came to &s;ee what had given occa&s;ion to this report; and when they could not get into the hou&s;e for the throngs of people, they cau&s;ed a me&s;&s;age to be conveyed from one to another, till it was told JESUS, "That his mother and his brethren were at the door, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with him." JESUS being accordingly in|formed of their coming, and that they waited to &s;peak with him, being at that in&s;tant engaged in the work of his mini&s;try, preaching the word of God, he made this reply, <HI>Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</HI> And looking upon tho&s;e that were round about him, he &s;aid, <HI>The&s;e are my mother and brethren;</HI> declaring, <HI>That who&s;oever did the will of his heavenly Father, the &s;ame was his mother, and &s;i&s;ter, and brother.</HI> This was what CHRIST had taught in another place, that we mu&s;t perfer God to all human rela|tions, and give the preference to his &s;ervice: but this &s;aying could not reflect upon his mother, who was among&s;t the principle of tho&s;e who did the will of his heavenly Father.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY upon Mary's approach, a woman of the company &s;aid with a loud voice, directing her words to JESUS: <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou ha&s;t &s;ucked.</HI> To which he replied, <HI>Yea, rather ble&s;&s;ed are they that hear the word of God and keep it.</HI> Not intimating hereby, that &s;he who had the honour to hear him, did not de&s;erve to be called ble&s;&s;ed throughout all generations; but that even her happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted more in doing the will of CHRIST than in giving him a human body, which was indeed not her own act, but effected by the power of God.</P>
<P>WE have no further account of the holy virgin from this time, till we find her in Jeru&s;alem at the la&s;t pa&s;&s;over our Saviour celebrated there; which was in the thirty-&s;ixth year of CHRIST, and thirty-third of the vulgar aera. In this city &s;he &s;aw all that was tran&s;acted again&s;t him, followed him to Mount Calvary, and &s;tayed at the foot of the cro&s;s during the pa&s;&s;ion of her ble&s;&s;ed Son. We cannot doubt but her &s;oul was at this time pierced through, as old Simeon had prophe&s;ied, with the mo&s;t acute pains, for the death of &s;uch a Son. Yet her con&s;tancy was remarkable: for when the apo&s;tles were all frightened away from their Ma&s;ter, &s;he, with a courage undaunted, and worthy of the mother of CHRIST, continued even in the mid&s;t of the executioners, being prepared to die with her Son, who was now become her Saviour; who being now

ready to leave the world, and &s;eeing his mother at the foot of the cro&s;s, and his beloved di&s;ciple St. John near her, he bequeathed her to him by his la&s;t will and te&s;tament, &s;ay|ing, to his mother, <HI>Woman, behold thy Son;</HI> and to his di&s;ciple, <HI>Behold thy mother.</HI> And from that hour the di&s;ciple took her home to his own hou&s;e, and provided for her.</P>
<P>SOME authors of the fifth century think the virgin Mary died and was buried at Jeru|&s;alem, or rather in her &s;epulchre at Geth&s;emane, near that city, where, to this day, it is &s;hewn in a magnificent church dedicated to her.</P>
<P>THE ancient fathers of the Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern churches, a&s;&s;erted her perpetual virginity, and St. Augu&s;tine tells us, that this is one of tho&s;e points which we ought to receive as of apo&s;tolic tradition, &s;ince the Holy Scripture gives us no more account of it, than by only remarking how fully the ble&s;&s;ed virgin was re&s;olved to &s;erve God with an entire purity. The title which hath been con&s;tantly appropriated to her in all ages, as often as &s;he is mentioned, is a good argument to confirm our belief concerning this: See Ezek. xliv.2.</P>

of the Sanhedrim, who condemned and put JESUS CHRIST to death: but when our Saviour was dead, he went boldly to Pilate, and de&s;ired the body of JESUS, in order to bury it. This he obtained; and, accordingly he buried it after an honourable man|ner, in a &s;epulchre newly made in a garden, which was upon the &s;ame Mount Calvary where JESUS had been crucified. After he had placed it there, he clo&s;ed the entrance of it with a &s;tone cut particularly for this purpo&s;e, and which exactly filled the open part.</P>

<HEAD>PHILEMON, A GENTILE CONVERT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS eminent di&s;ciple was a rich citizen of Colo&s;&s;e, and probably a native of that place. He was converted, together with his wife, to the chri&s;tian faith, by Epa|phras, a di&s;ciple of St. Paul; for St. Paul him&s;elf never preached in Colo&s;&s;e, though he wrote an epi&s;tle to the brethren there.</P>
<P>WE read, that Philemon had made a church of his hou&s;e: and all his dome&s;tics, as well as him&s;elf, were of the hou&s;ehold of faith. His charity, liberality, and compa&s;|&s;ion were a &s;ure refuge to all who were in di&s;tre&s;s: he followed the example of that great Ma&s;ter in whom he believed; and was delighted, when exerci&s;ed in works of beneficence and mercy. His name is placed on the twenty-&s;econd of November in the martyrologies.</P>

<HEAD>PRISCILLA, A JEWISH CONVERT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the times of the apo&s;tles, Pri&s;cilla was very famous in the church, and is often mentioned by the &s;acred writers before her hu&s;band Aquila. They were both Jews; but their country and births are uncertain. They were at Corinth when St. Paul came thither, and had the happine&s;s of entertaining him in their hou&s;e a very con&s;iderable time; the apo&s;tle being of the &s;ame trade with Aquila; namely, a maker of tents of leather, for the u&s;e of the army, and at which they both wrought for &s;ome time, for their livelihood.</P>
<P>ON St. Paul's leaving Corinth, both Aquila and Pri&s;cilla came with him to Ephe&s;us, where they dwelt a con&s;iderable time, and preached the go&s;pel with good &s;ucce&s;s. Their hou&s;e was &s;o well regulated, that St. Paul calls it a church; an example that &s;hould, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be followed by every one who pretends to be a follower of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, though &s;hamefully neglected by the greate&s;t part of chri&s;tians in the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>WHETHER they died in peace, or by the hands of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the progre&s;s of the chri&s;tian faith, is not known; but however this be, they laboured faithfully to ex|tend the religion of JESUS; and, therefore, have been ju&s;tly placed among&s;t the fir&s;t preachers of the go&s;pel in the apo&s;tolic age.</P>

<HEAD>APOLLOS, A JEWISH CONVERT.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancient writers give no account either of the birth or family of Apollos: all they mention is that he was a Jew of Alexandria, and came to Ephe&s;us during St. Paul's ab&s;ence, who was gone to Jeru&s;alem, to vi&s;it the other apo&s;tles and the church in that city.</P>
<P>THIS eminent per&s;on was di&s;tingui&s;hed for his eloquence, and knowledge of the Scrip|tures. He was in&s;tructed in the way of the Lord, and as he &s;poke with zeal and fer|vour, taught diligently the things relating to the kingdom of heaven, though he knew only the bapti&s;m of John.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="029927_0415_0FE33B1B6C7A2778">APOLLOS was no &s;ooner come to Ephe&s;us, than he began to &s;peak boldly in the &s;y|nagogue, and to &s;hew that JESUS was the CHRIST. Aquila and Pri&s;cilla, having heard him, took him home with them, in&s;tructed him more fully in the ways of the Almighty, and baptized him. He was very u&s;eful at Corinth, in convincing the Jews out of the Scriptures, and demon&s;trating to them that JESUS was the CHRIST. Thus he watered what Paul had planted in that city.</P>
<P>IT is allowed by all, that he was an active and powerful preacher of the go&s;pel; and that great numbers were, by his preaching, rendered obedient to the faith of CHRIST.</P>

<HEAD>TITUS, A GENTILE CONVERT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS eminent per&s;on was a Heathen by religion and birth, but converted by St. Paul, who calls him his &s;on. Titus was &s;ent by St. Paul to Corinth, upon occa|&s;ion of &s;ome di&s;putes which then divided the church. He was very well received by the Corinthians, and very much &s;atisfied with their ready compliance; but would re|ceive nothing from them, imitating thereby the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his Ma&s;ter, who &s;ought not theirs, but them.</P>
<P>HE went from Corinth to St. Paul into Macedonia, and gave him an account of the &s;tate of the Corinthian church. A little while after, the apo&s;tle de&s;ired him to return again to Corinth, to &s;et things in order again&s;t his coming. Titus readily undertook this journey, and departed immediately carrying with him St. Paul's &s;econd letter to the Corinthians.</P>
<P>TITUS was made bi&s;hop of the i&s;le of Crete, about the &s;ixty-third year of CHRIST, when St. Paul was obliged to quit this i&s;land, in order to take care of the other church<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. The following year he wrote to him to de&s;ire, that as &s;oon as he &s;hould have &s;ent Ty|chicus or Artemas to him for &s;upplying his place in Crete, Titus would come to him to Nicopolis in Macedonia, or to Nicopolis in Epirus upon the gulf of Ambracia, where the apo&s;tle intended to pa&s;s his winter. The &s;ubject of this epi&s;tle is to repre&s;ent to Titus what are the qualities that a bi&s;hop &s;hould be endued with.</P>
<P>ST. PAUL's epi&s;tle to Titus has always been acknowledged by the church. The Marcionities did not receive it, nor did the Ba&s;ilidians, and &s;ome other Heretics; but Tatian, the head of the Encratites, received it, and preferred it before all the re&s;t. It is not certainly known by whom it was &s;ent nor from what place it was written.</P>
<P>IT appears, that Titus was deputed to preach the go&s;pel in Dalmatia; and he was &s;till there in the year &s;ixty-five, when the apo&s;tle wrote his &s;econd epi&s;tle to Timothy. He died at the age of Ninety-four, and was buried in Crete. His fe&s;tival is kept by the Greeks on the 25th of Augu&s;t, and on the 4th of January by the Latin church.</P>

<HEAD>TIMOTHY, A GENTILE CONVERT.</HEAD>
<P>HE was born according to &s;ome at Ly&s;tra; or, according to others, at Derbe. His father was a Gentile, but his mother a Jewe&s;s, who&s;e name was Eunice&punc; and that of his grandmother Lais. He was a convert and di&s;ciple of St. Paul.</P>
<P>WE take notice of the&s;e particulars, becau&s;e St. Paul commends their piety, and the good education which they had given Timothy. When St. Paul came to Derbe and Ly&s;tra about the year of CHRIST fifty-one or fifty-two, the brethren gave a very advan|tageous te&s;timony of the merit and good di&s;po&s;itions of Timothy; and the apo&s;tle would have him along with him; but he circumci&s;ed him at Ly&s;tra, before he received him into his company.</P>
<P>TIMOTHY applied him&s;elf to labour with St. Paul in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the go&s;pel; and did him very important &s;ervices, through the whole cour&s;e of his preaching.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="029927_0416_0FE33B1CF7BAB170">TIMOTHY accompanied St. Paul to Macedonia, to Philippi, to The&s;&s;alonica, to Berea; and when the apo&s;tle went from Berea, he left Timothy and Silas there to confirm the converts. When he came to Athens, he &s;ent to Timothy to come thither to him; and when he was come, and had given him an account of the churches of Macedonia, St. Paul &s;ent him back to The&s;&s;alonica, from whence he afterwards returned with Silas, and came to St. Paul at Corinth. There he continued with him, and the apo&s;tle men|tions him with Silas, at the beginning of the two epi&s;tles, which he then wrote to the church at The&s;&s;alonica. In the year &s;ixty-three, when St. Paul wrote to the Hebrews, he tells them that Timothy was come out of pri&s;on; but he gives us no circum&s;tances either of the impri&s;onment of this di&s;ciple, or of his relea&s;e. In &s;ixty-four, when St. Paul returned from Rome, he left Timothy at Ephe&s;us, to take care of that church, of which he was the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop, as he is recognized by the council of Chalcedon. St. Paul wrote to Timothy from Macedonia, the fir&s;t of the two letters which are addre&s;&s;ed to him.</P>
<P>WE may &s;afely affirm, that if he did not die before the year ninety-&s;even, he mu&s;t be the angel of the church of Ephe&s;us, to whom St. John writes, Rev. ii.2&mdash;5: though the reproaches which the Holy Gho&s;t make to him, &amp;c. of having left his fir&s;t love, do not &s;eem to belong to &s;o holy a man as Timothy was.</P>

<HEAD>ST. STEPHEN, THE PROTO-MARTYR.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year fifty-three, the &s;even deacons were cho&s;en, and we find St. Stephen always placed at their head, as the chief and mo&s;t worthy; and it is generally believed, that he had been brought up at the feet of Gamaliel. However, he was remarkably zealous for the cau&s;e of religion, and full of the Holy Gho&s;t; working many wonderful mira|cles before the people, and pre&s;&s;ing them with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s to embrace the doctrines of the go&s;pel of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>THE Jews were highly provoked at the zeal of Stephen, and &s;ome of the &s;ynagogue of the freed men of Cyrenia, Alexandria, and other places, entered into di&s;pute with him; but being unable to re&s;i&s;t the wi&s;dom and &s;pirit by which he &s;pake, they &s;uborned fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him, to te&s;tify that they heard him bla&s;pheme again&s;t Mo&s;es and again&s;t God. Nor did they &s;top here: they &s;tirred up the people by their calumnies: &s;o that they dragged him before the council of the nation, or great Sanhedrim, where they produced fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him, who depo&s;ed, that they had heard him &s;peak again&s;t the temple, and again&s;t the law, and affirm that JESUS of Nazareth would de&s;troy the holy place, and aboli&s;h the law of Mo&s;es. Stephen, &s;upported by his own innocence, and an invi&s;ible Power from on high, appeared undaunted in the mid&s;t of this a&s;&s;embly, and his countenance &s;hone like that of an angel.</P>
<P>THE Jewi&s;h council were &s;o highly enraged at the &s;peech of Stephen, e&s;pecially the latter part of it, that they gna&s;hed their teeth again&s;t him: but Stephen lifting up his eyes to heaven, &s;aw the glory of God, and JESUS &s;tanding at the right hand of Omni|potence; upon which, he &s;aid to the council, <HI>I &s;ee the heavens open, and the Son of man &s;tanding at the right hand of God.</HI> This &s;o greatly provoked the Jews, that they cried out with one voice, and &s;topped their ears, as if they had heard &s;ome dreadful bla&s;phemy; and falling upon him, they dragged him out of the city, and &s;toned him to death.</P>
<P>IT is related in Scripture, that St. Stephen, while they were mangling his body with &s;tones, was praying to God for their pardon. <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>lay not this &s;in to their charge.</HI> And then calling on his dear Redeemer to receive his &s;pirit, he yielded up his &s;oul. Some pious per&s;ons who beheld the martyrdom of this good man, took care to bury his remains; and the church attended his funeral with great lamentations.</P>

<HEAD>ST. SILAS OR SYLVANUS, AN HEBREW DISCIPLE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS holy per&s;on was, according to St. Luke, a chief man among&s;t the brethren, an expre&s;&s;ion which indicates that he was one of the &s;eventy di&s;ciples: but the fir&s;t ac|count we have of him is in the tran&s;action relating to the di&s;pute between the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian converts, with regard to the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping the law of Mo&s;es, when they cho&s;e Paul, Barnabas, Judas and Silas, to go to Jeru&s;alem, to advi&s;e with the apo&s;tles concerning this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>BE that as it may, when the di&s;pute happened between Paul and Barnabas, which ter|minated in a rupture, Silas joined him&s;elf to Paul, and became his companion and a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the great work of preaching the go&s;pel to the Gentiles. They fir&s;t vi&s;ited the churches of Syria and Cilicia; from thence they pa&s;&s;ed into Lyconia, Phrygia, and Galatia; and la&s;tly, they cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea and came into Macedonia.</P>
<P>DURING their &s;tay at Philippi, they found a young woman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an unclean &s;pirit, who followed them &s;everal days, till Paul ca&s;t out the evil &s;pirit, and delivered her from &s;o dreadful a plague. This action provoked the ma&s;ters of the young woman; for &s;he acquired con&s;iderable gains by the oracles and predictions the devil pronounced by making u&s;e of her organs: they therefore &s;eized upon Paul and Silas, dragged them before the magi&s;trates, and accu&s;ed them of introducing cu&s;toms among&s;t them, contra|ry to tho&s;e of the Romans; &s;o that the magi&s;trates ordered that Paul and Silas &s;hould be &s;courged, and committed to pri&s;on: but in the night-time there was a great earth|quake, the doors of the pri&s;on opened, and the fetters of the pri&s;oners fell off without any human a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>DEPARTING from Philippi, they travelled to The&s;&s;alonica and Berea, where they preached the doctrines of the go&s;pel; and Paul continuing his journey to Athens: &s;ent Silas thither, though they did not meet till they both arrived at Corinth, where St. Paul wrote his two epi&s;tles to the The&s;&s;alonian church.</P>

<HEAD>ST. PHILIP, THE DEACON, AN HEBREW CONVERT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;uppo&s;ed that St. Philip was a native of Cae&s;area in Galilee, it being certain that his daughters lived in that city; however, he was one of the &s;even deacons cho&s;en by the apo&s;tles &s;oon after our Saviour's re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>ALL the Chri&s;tians, except the apo&s;tles, having, after the death of St. Stephen, left Jeru&s;alem, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves in &s;everal parts, St. Philip went down to preach the go&s;pel at Samaria, where he wrought many miracles, and converted great numbers to the faith; he al&s;o baptized them, but being only a deacon, could not admini&s;ter the &s;a|crament of the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P>IT is probable St. Philip was at Samaria when the angel directed him to go towards the South, to the road that leads from Jeru&s;alem to Old Gaza, an ancient city in the route to Egypt. Philip obeyed the &s;ummons of the heavenly me&s;&s;enger, and there met with an Ethiopian eunuch, belonging to Candace, queen of Ethiopia; a per&s;on who was highly e&s;teemed by his mi&s;tre&s;s, as well as intru&s;ted with the care of all her revenues, and who had been at Jeru&s;alem, to wor&s;hip the Almighty in that city.</P>
<P>WHEN the chariot of this Ethiopian appeared in the &s;ight of Philip, the angel bid him advance towards the &s;tranger: he immediately obeyed, and heard the eunuch, reading a pa&s;&s;age of the prophet I&s;aiah; upon which Philip a&s;ked him, if he under&s;tood what he was reading? And the eunuch an&s;wered, How &s;hould I under&s;tand, except &s;ome per&s;on &s;hould explain it to me; de&s;iring Philip, that he would come and &s;it down by him in the chariot. The pa&s;&s;age he read was this; <HI>He was led as a &s;heep to the &s;laughter; and as
<PB N="394" REF="029927_0418_0FE33B20C2605A48">
a lamb before his &s;hearers is dumb, &s;o he opened not his mouth.</HI> Having fini&s;hed this pa&s;&s;age, the eunuch de&s;ired to know whom the prophet intended: "Is it, &s;ays he, him&s;elf the prophet here means, or &s;ome other man." In an&s;wer to the que&s;tion propo&s;ed by the eunuch, Philip began to in&s;truct him concerning the Redeemer of the world, the man CHRIST JESUS; and afterwards baptized him, and he became a member of the church of CHRIST.</P>
<P>THE &s;acred writers are &s;ilent with regard to the actions of St. Philip, after the time of his baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch&mdash;but the Greek eccle&s;ia&s;tical writers &s;ay, that he left Pale&s;tine and travelled to Tralles, in the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, where he founded a church, of which he was both the bi&s;hop and apo&s;tle; and where, after long labouring in the vineyard of his Ma&s;ter, and working many miracles, he &s;lept in peace, and was buried in the church he had cau&s;ed to be erected.</P>
<P>HAVING now given the mo&s;t ample account po&s;&s;ible of the followers of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, the per&s;ons who &s;pread the light of the glorious go&s;pel over the whole world, removed the veil of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition drawn over the kingdoms of the earth, and taught us the method of attaining eternal happine&s;s in the courts of the new Je|ru&s;alem&mdash;may it be our highe&s;t ambition to follow their bright example, as they fol|lowed CHRIST; may we imitate their faith, piety, hope, and love: then &s;hall we pa&s;s through things temporal in &s;uch a manner, that we &s;hall finally gain the things that are eternal, and be admitted as worthy gue&s;ts at the marriage-&s;upper of the Lamb, to adore and prai&s;e him, and live and reign with him in his heavenly kingdom for ever and ever.

<HEAD>THE CHURCH AT JERUSALEM, IN JUDEA.</HEAD>
<P>IT may with &s;ome degree of truth be affirmed, that the church of Jeru&s;alem was founded by our Lord him&s;elf, as it was for &s;ome time cultivated and improved by the mini&s;try of the whole college of apo&s;tles. The bi&s;hops of it &s;ucceeded in the fol|lowing order.</P>
<P N="1">1. ST. JAMES the Le&s;s, the brother of our Lord, by him, &s;ay &s;ome, immediately con|&s;tituted bi&s;hop; but as others, more probably, by the apo&s;tles: he was thrown off the temple, and his brains beat out with a fuller's club. 2. Simeon, the &s;on of Cleophas, brother of Jo&s;eph, our Lord's reputed father he &s;at in this chair twenty-three years, and &s;uffered martyrdom in the reign of Trajan, in the one hundred and twentieth year of his age. 3. Ju&s;tus &s;ucceeded in his room, and &s;at &s;ix years. 4. Zecheus, or, as Nicepho|rus the patriarch calls him, Zacharias, four. 5. Tobias: to him, after four years, &s;uc|ceeded. 6. Benjamin, who &s;at two years. 7. John, who continued the &s;ame &s;pace. 8. Matthias, or Matthaeus, two years. 9. Philipus, one year: next came. 10. Senaca, who &s;at four years. 11. Ju&s;tus, four. 12. Levi, or Lebes, two. 13. Ephrem, or, Ep|hres, or, as Epiphanius &s;tyles him, Vaphres, two. 14. Jo&s;eph, two. 15. Judas, two. We may ob&s;erve, that mo&s;t of the&s;e bi&s;hops governed the church but a &s;hort time, following one another with a very quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; which, doubtle&s;s, was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the turbulent and unquiet humour of the Jewi&s;h nation, frequently rebelling again&s;t the Roman powers, whereby they provoked them to fall heavy upon them, and cut off all that came in their way, making no di&s;tinction between Jews and Chri&s;tians; as indeed they were all Jews, though differing in the rites of their religion: for hithereto the bi&s;hops of Jeru&s;alem had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively been of the circum&s;ion, the church there having been entirely made up of Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h converts: but Jeru&s;alem being now utterly laid wa&s;te, and the Jews di&s;per&s;ed into all other countries, the Gentiles were admitted not only into the body of that church, but even into the epi&s;copal chair.

26. Antonius, five. 27. Valens, three. 28. Dulichianus, two. 29. Narci&s;&s;us, four. He was a man of eminent piety, famous for the great miracles which he wrought; but not being able to bear the a&s;per&s;ions which &s;ome unju&s;tly ca&s;t upon him (though God finally and miraculou&s;ly vindicated his innocency) he left his church, and retired into de&s;arts and &s;olitary places. In his ab&s;ence was cho&s;en. 30. Dius, who &s;at eight years after him. 31. Germanio, four. 32. Gordius, five. In his time Narci&s;&s;us, as one from the dead, returned from his place of retirement, and was importuned by the people again to take the government of the church upon him; being highly reverenced by them, both for his &s;trict and philo&s;ophical cour&s;e of life, and the &s;ignal vengeance which God took of his accu&s;ers: and in this &s;econd admini&s;tration he continued ten years, &s;uffering martyrdom when he was near an hundred and twenty years old. To relieve the infirmities of his great age, they took in to be his colleague, 33. Alexander, formerly bi&s;hop in Cappadocia: he was an eminent confe&s;&s;or, and after having &s;at fifteen years, died in pri&s;on under the Decian per&s;ecution. 34. Mazabanes, nine years. 35. Hymenaeus, twenty-three. 36. Zabdas, ten. 37. Hermon, nine. He was as Eu&s;ebius tells us, the la&s;t bi&s;hop of this &s;ee, before that fatal per&s;ecution that raged even in his time. 38. Macarius, ordained A. D. three hundred and fifteen: he was pre&s;ent in the great Nicence council.

Polycarpus, &s;eventeen. 11. Athenodorus, four. He erected a church called Elea, afterwards much beautified and enlarged by Con&s;tantine the Great. 12. Euzoius, &s;ixteen; though Nicephorus Calli&s;tus allows but &s;ix. 13. Laurentius, eleven years and &s;ix months. 14. Alypius, thirteen. 15.

In the fir&s;t year of his bi&s;hopric, he built a church in the north part of the city, which he dedicated to the honour of Euphemia the martyr, who had &s;uffered in that place. In this oratory he &s;pent the remainder of his life, quitting his epi&s;copal chair to 20. Titus, who &s;at thirty-five years and &s;ix-months; though Nicephorus Calli&s;tus makes it thirty-&s;even years. After him came 21. Dometius, brother (as they tell us) to the emperor Probus.

<P>"THAT Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar had ordered the whole empire to be cen&s;ed or taxed," which brought our Saviour's reputed parents to Bethlehem: this is mentioned by &s;everal Roman hi&s;torians, as Tacitus, Suetonius, and Dion. "That a great light, or a new &s;tar appeared in the ea&s;t, which directed the wi&s;e men to our Saviour:" this is recorded by Chalcidius. "That Herod, the king of Pale&s;tine, &s;o often mentioned in the Roman hi&s;tory, made a great &s;laughter of innocent children," being &s;o jealous of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, that he put to death his own &s;ons on that account; this character of him is given by &s;everal hi&s;torians,
<PB N="400" REF="029927_0424_0FE33B3633C1E0C0">
and this cruel fact mentioned by Macrobius, a Heathen author, who tells it as a known thing, without any mark or doubt upon it. "That our Saviour had been in Egypt:" this, Cel&s;us, though he rai&s;es a mon&s;trous &s;tory upon it, is &s;o far from denying, that he tells us our Saviour learned the arts of magic in that country. "That Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea; that our Saviour was brought in judgment before him, and by him condemned and crucified:" this is recorded by Tacitus. "That many miraculous cures and works, out of the ordinary cour&s;e of nature, were wrought by him:" this is confe&s;&s;ed by Julian the apo&s;tate Porphyry, and Hierocles, all of them not only Pagans, but profe&s;&s;ed enemies and per&s;ecutors of Chri&s;tianity. "That our Saviour foretold &s;everal things which came to pa&s;s according to his predictions:" this was atte&s;ted by Phelegon, in his annals, as we are a&s;&s;ured by the learned Origin again&s;t Cel&s;us. "That at the time when our Saviour died, there was a miraculous darkne&s;s, and a great earthquake:" this is reckoned by the &s;ame Phelegon the Trallian, who was likewi&s;e a Pagan, and freeman to Adrian the emperor. We may here ob&s;erve, that a native of Trallian, which was not &s;ituated at &s;o great a di&s;tance from Pale&s;tine, might very probably be informed of &s;uch remarkable events as had pa&s;&s;ed among&s;t the Jews in the age immediately preceding his own times, &s;ince &s;everal of his countrymen with whom he had conver&s;ed, might have received a confu&s;ed report of our Saviour before his crucifixion, and probably lived within the &s;hake of the earthquake, and the &s;hadow of the eclip&s;e, which are recorded by this author&punc; "That CHRIST was wor&s;hipped as a God among&s;t the Chri&s;tians; that they would rather &s;uffer death than bla&s;pheme him; that they received a &s;acrament, and by it entered into a vow of ab&s;taining from &s;in and wickedne&s;s," conformable to the advice given by St. Paul; "that they had private a&s;&s;emblies of wor&s;hip, and u&s;ed to join toge|ther in hymns:" this is the account which Pliny the younger gives of Chri&s;tianity in his days, about &s;eventy years after the death of CHRIST, and which agrees in all its circum|&s;tances with the account we have in holy writ, of the fir&s;t &s;tate of Chri&s;tianity after the crucifixion of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. "That St. Peter, who&s;e miracles are many of them recorded in holy writ, did many wonderful works," is owned by Julian, the apo&s;tate, who therefore repre&s;ents him as a great magician, and one who had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a book of magical &s;ecrets left him by our Saviour. "That the devils or evil &s;pirits were &s;ubject to them," we may learn from Porphyry, who objects to Chri&s;tianity, that &s;ince JESUS had began to be wor&s;hipped, Ae&s;culapius and the re&s;t of the gods did no more con|ver&s;e with men: nay, Cel&s;us him&s;elf affirms the &s;ame thing in effect, when he &s;ays, that the power which &s;eemed to re&s;ide in Chri&s;tians proceeded from the u&s;e of certain names, and the invocation of certain daemon's ; Origin remarks on this pa&s;&s;age, that the au|thor doubtle&s;s hints at tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who put to flight evil &s;pirits and healed tho&s;e who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with them; a fact which had been often &s;een, and which he him&s;elf had &s;een, as he declares in another part of his di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t Cel&s;us. But at the &s;ame time, he a&s;&s;ures by the u&s;e of no other name but that of JESUS, to which were added &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in his hi&s;tory, but nothing like any invocation to daemons.</P>
<P>CELSUS was &s;o hard &s;et with the report of our Saviour's miracles, and the confident atte&s;tations concerning him, that though he often intimates he did not believe them to be true, yet knowing he might be &s;ilenced in &s;uch an an&s;wer, provides him&s;elf with ano|ther retreat, when beaten out of this, namely, that our Saviour was a magician. Thus he compares the feeding of &s;o many thou&s;ands, at two different time, with a few loaves and fi&s;hes, to the magical fea&s;ts of tho&s;e Egyptian impo&s;tors, who would pre&s;ent their &s;pectators with vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ry entertainments, that had in them neither &s;ub&s;tance nor reality: which, by the way, is to &s;uppo&s;e, that an hungry and fainting multitude were filled by an apparition, or &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">gthened and refre&s;hed with &s;hadows.</P>
<P>THE unconverted Heathens, who were pre&s;&s;ed by the many authorities that confirmed our Saviour's miracles, as well as the unbelieving Jews, who had actully &s;een them, were
<PB N="401" REF="029927_0425_0FE33B37B5890460">
driven to account for them after the &s;ame manner; for, to work by magic, in the Hea|then way of &s;peaking, was, in the language of the Jews, to ca&s;t out devils by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. Our Saviour, who new that unbelievers, in all ages, would put this perver&s;e interpretation on his miracles, has branded the malignity of tho&s;e men, who, contrary to the dictates of their own hearts &s;tarted &s;uch an unrea&s;onable objection, as a bla&s;phemy again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, and declared not only the guilt, but the puni&s;hment of &s;o black a crime. At the &s;ame time, he conde&s;cended to &s;hew the vanity and empti|ne&s;s of this objection again&s;t his miracles, by repre&s;enting, that they evidently tended to the de&s;truction of tho&s;e powers, to who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance the enemies of his doctrine then a&s;crib|ed them. An argument which,if duly weighed, renders the objection &s;o very frivolous and groundle&s;s that we may venture to call it even bla&s;phemy again&s;t common &s;en&s;e. It would be ab&s;urd to imagine, that evil &s;pirits would enter into a combination with our Saviour to cut off all their corre&s;pondence and intercour&s;e with mankind, and to prevent any for the future from addicting them&s;elves to tho&s;e rites and ceremonies, which had done them &s;o much honour. We &s;ee the early effect which Chri&s;tianity had on the minds of men in this particular, by that number of books which were filled with the &s;ecrets of magic, and made a &s;acrifice to Chri&s;tianity by the converts mentioned in the Acts of the apo&s;tles. We have likewi&s;e an eminent in&s;tance of the incon&s;i&s;tency of our religon with magic, in the hi&s;tory of the famous Aquila. This per&s;on, who was a kin&s;|man of the emperor Trajan, and likewi&s;e a man of great learning, notwith&s;tanding he had embraced Chri&s;tianity, could not be brought off from the &s;tudies of magic, by the repeated admonitions of his fellow Chri&s;tians; &s;o that at length they expelled him their &s;ociety, as rather choo&s;ing to lo&s;e the reputation of &s;o con&s;iderable a pro&s;elyte, than communicate with one who dealt in &s;uch dark and infernal practices. Be&s;ides, we may ob&s;erve, that all the favourers of magic were the mo&s;t profe&s;&s;ed and bitter enemies to the Chri&s;tian religion; not to mention Simon Magus and many others, we &s;hall only take notice of tho&s;e two great per&s;ecutors of Chri&s;tianity, the emperors Adrian and Julian the apo&s;tate, both of them initiated in the my&s;teries of divination, and &s;killed in all the depths of magic.&mdash;We &s;hall only add, that evil &s;pirits cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have con|cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a religion, which triumphed over them, drove them out of the places they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and dive&s;ted them of their influence on mankind; nor would we mention this particular, though it be Chri&s;tian authors, did it not appear from the authorities above cited, that this was a fact confe&s;&s;ed by Heathens them&s;elves.</P>
<P>WHEN a man is born under Chri&s;tian parents, and trained up in the profe&s;&s;ion of that religion from a child, he generally guides him&s;elf by the rules of the Chri&s;tian faith, in believing what is delivered by the evangeli&s;ts; the learned Pagans of antiquity, be|fore they became Chri&s;tians, were only guided by the common rules of hi&s;torical faith; that is they examined the nature of the evidence which was to be met with in common fame, tradition, and the writings of tho&s;e per&s;ons who related them, together with the number, concurrence, veracity, and private characters of tho&s;e per&s;ons; and being convinced up|on all accounts, that they had the &s;ame rea&s;on to believe the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, as that of any other per&s;on to which they them&s;elves were not actually eye-witne&s;&s;es, they were bound by all the rules of hi&s;torical faith, and of right rea&s;on to give credit to this hi&s;tory. This they did accordingly, and in con&s;equence of it, publi&s;hed the &s;ame truths them&s;elves, &s;uffered many afflictions, and very often death it&s;elf, in the a&s;&s;ertion of them. But while we affirm, an hi&s;torical belief of the acts of our Saviour might induce the&s;e learned Pagans to embrace his doctrine, we do not deny that there were many other motives, which conduced to it, as the excellency of his precepts, the fulfilling of pro|phecies, the miracles of his di&s;ciples, the irreproachable lives and magnanimous &s;uffer|ings of their followers, with other con&s;iderations of the &s;ame nature; but whatever other collateral arguments wrought more or le&s;s with philo&s;ophers of that age, it is
<PB N="402" REF="029927_0426_0FE33B393923CAD8">
certain that a belief in the hi&s;tory of our Saviour was one motive with every new con|vert, and that upon which all others turned, as being the very ba&s;is and foundation of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>A learned man of our nation, who examined the writings of our mo&s;t ancient fathers, refers to &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clemens of Alexandria, Origen, and Cyprian, by which he plainly &s;hews, that each of the&s;e early writers, a&s;cribed to the four evangeli&s;ts by name their re&s;pective hi&s;tories; &s;o that there is not the lea&s;t room for doubting of their belief in the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, as recorded in the go&s;pels. We &s;hall only add that three of the five fathers here mentioned, and probably four, were Pagans converted to Chri&s;tianity, as they were all of them very inqui&s;itive and deep in the knowledge of Heathen learning and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>SEVERAL of the&s;e therefore, when they had informed them&s;elves of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, and examined with unprejudiced minds the doctrines and manners of his di&s;ci|ples and followers, were &s;o &s;truck and convinced, that they profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, of the fact; notwith&s;tanding, by this profe&s;&s;ion in that juncture of time, they bid farewell to all the plea&s;ures of this life renounced all the views of ambition, engaged in an unin|terrupted cour&s;e of &s;everities, and expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the public hatred and contempt, to &s;ufferings of all kinds, and to death it&s;elf. Of this &s;ort we may reckon tho&s;e three early converts to Chri&s;tianity, who each of them was a member of a &s;enate famous for its wi&s;dom and learning. Jo&s;eph the Arimathein, was of the Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim: Diony|&s;ius, of the Athenian Areopagus; and Flavius Clemens, of the Roman &s;enate; nay at the time of his death, con&s;ul of Rome.</P>
<P>TERTULLIAN tells the Roman governors, that their corporations, councils, armies, tribes, companies, the palace, &s;enate, and courts of judicature were filled with Chri&s;|tians; as Arnobius a&s;&s;erts, that men of the fine&s;t parts and learning, oratory, gramma|rians, rhetoricians, lawyers, phy&s;icians, philo&s;ophers, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;entiments they had been once fond of, took up their re&s;t in the Chri&s;tian religion; and who can imagine, that men of this character did not thoroughly inform them&s;elves of the hi&s;tory of that per&s;on who&s;e doctrines they embraced?</P>
<P>BESIDES innumerable authors that are lo&s;t, we have the undoubted names, works, or fragments of &s;everal Pagan philo&s;ophers, which &s;hew them to have been as learned as any unconverted Heathen authors of the age in which they lived. If we look into the greate&s;t nur&s;eries of learning in tho&s;e ages of the world, we find in Athens, Diony|&s;ius, Quadratus, Ari&s;tides, and Athenagoras; and in Alexandria, Diony&s;ius, Clemans, Ammonius, and to whom we may add Origen; for though his father was a Chri&s;tian martyr, he became without all controver&s;y, the mo&s;t learned and able philo&s;opher of his age, by his education at Alexandria, in that famous &s;eminary of arts and &s;ciences.</P>
<P>HEATHENS of every age, &s;ex, and quality, born in the mo&s;t different climates, and bred up under the mo&s;t different in&s;titutions, when they &s;aw men of plain &s;en&s;e without the help of learning, armed with patience and courage, in&s;tead of wealth, pomp or power, expre&s;&s;ing in their lives tho&s;e excellent doctrines of morality, which they taught as deliver|ed to them from our Saviour, averring that they had &s;een his miracles during his life, and conver&s;ed with him after his death; when they &s;aw no &s;u&s;picion of fal&s;ehood, treachery, or worldly intere&s;t, in their behaviour and conver&s;ation, and that they &s;ubmitted to the mo&s;t ignominious and cruel deaths, rather than retract their te&s;timony, or even be &s;ilent in mat|ters which they were to publi&s;h by their Saviour's e&s;pecial command, there was no rea|&s;on to doubt of the veracity of tho&s;e facts which they related, or of the divine mi&s;&s;ion in which they were employed,</P>
<P>A few per&s;ons of an odious and de&s;pi&s;ed country, could not have filled the world with believers, had they not &s;hewn undoubted credentials from the divine Per&s;on who &s;ent them on &s;uch a me&s;&s;age. Accordingly, we are a&s;&s;ured, that they were inve&s;ted with
<PB N="403" REF="029927_0427_0FE33B44A030FF50">
the power of working miracles, which was the mo&s;t &s;hort and the mo&s;t convincing ar|gument that could be produced, and the only one that was adapted to the rea&s;on of all mankind, to the capacities of the wi&s;e and ignorant, and could overcome every cavil and every prejudice. Who would not believe that our Saviour healed the &s;ick, and rai&s;ed the dead, when it was publi&s;hed by tho&s;e who them&s;elves often did the &s;ame miracles, in their pre&s;ence, and in his name? Could any rea&s;onable per&s;on imagine, that God Almighty would arm men with &s;uch powers to authorize a lie, and e&s;tabli&s;h a religion in the world which was di&s;plea&s;ing to him, or that evil &s;pirits would lend them &s;uch an effectual a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to beat down vice and idolatry.</P>
<P>WHEN the apo&s;tles had formed many a&s;&s;emblies in &s;everal parts of the Pagan world, who gave credit to the glad-tidings of the go&s;pel, that, upon their departure, the me|mory of what they had related might not peri&s;h, they appointed out of the&s;e new con|verts, men of the be&s;t &s;en&s;e and of the mo&s;t unblemi&s;hed lives, to pre&s;ide over the&s;e &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies, and to inculcate without cea&s;ing, what they had heard from the mouths of the&s;e eye-witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bi&s;hops was quick in the three fir&s;t centuries, becau&s;e the bi&s;hop very often ended in the martyr : for when a per&s;ecution aro&s;e in any place, the fir&s;t fury of it fell upon this order of holy men, who abundantly te&s;tified by their deaths and &s;uf|ferings, that they did not undertake the&s;e offices out of any temporal views, that they were &s;incere and &s;atisfied in the belief of what they taught, and that they firmly adhered to what they had received from the apo&s;tles, as laying down their lives in the &s;ame hope, and upon the &s;ame principles. None can be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o utterly regardle&s;s of their own hap|pine&s;s, as to expire in torment, and hazard their eternity, to &s;upport any fables and inven|tions of their own, or any forgeries of their predece&s;&s;ors who had pre&s;ided in the &s;ame church, and which might have been ea&s;ily detected by the tradition of that particular church, as well as by the concurring te&s;timony of others. To this purpo&s;e, we think it is very remarkable, that there was not a &s;ingle martyr among&s;t tho&s;e many heretics, who di&s;agreed with the apo&s;tolical church, and introduced &s;everal wild and ab&s;urd notions into the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity. They dur&s;t not &s;take their pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s on their own chimerical imaginations, and did not only &s;hun per&s;ecution, but affirmed, that it was unnece&s;&s;ary for their followers to bear their religion through &s;uch fiery trials.</P>
<P>AMONGST the accounts of tho&s;e very few, out of innumerable multitudes who had em|braced Chri&s;tianity, we &s;hall &s;ingle out four per&s;ons eminent for their lives, their writings, and their &s;ufferings, that were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively cotemporaries, and bring us down as far as to the year of our Lord 254. St. John, who was the beloved di&s;ciple, and conver&s;ed the mo&s;t intimately with our Saviour, lived till A. D. 100. Polycarp, who was the di&s;ciple of St. John, and had conver&s;ed with other of the apo&s;tles and di&s;ciples of our Lord, lived till A. D. 167, though his life was &s;hortened by martyrdom. Irenaeus, who was the di&s;ci|ple of Polycarp, and had conver&s;ed with many of the immediate di&s;ciples of the apo&s;tles, lived at the lowe&s;t computation of his age, till the year 202, when he was likewi&s;e cut o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">y martyrdom: in which year the great Origen was appointed regent of the catee|heti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;chool in Alexandria, and as he was the miracle of that age, for indu&s;try, learning, and philo&s;ophy, he was looked on as the champion of Chri&s;tianity, till the year 254, when he died, he was certainly actuated by the &s;pirit of it, as appears in the whole cour&s;e of his life and writings; nay, he had undergone trials wor&s;e than death.</P>
<P>THE Chri&s;tians, who carried their religion through &s;o many general and particular per&s;ecutions, were ince&s;&s;antly comforting and &s;upporting one another with the example and hi&s;tory of our Saviour and his apo&s;tles: it was the &s;ubject not only of their &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies, but of their private vi&s;its and conver&s;ation. "Our virgins," &s;ays Tatian, who lived in the &s;econd century, "di&s;cour&s;e over their di&s;taffs on divine &s;ubjects." Indeed when religion was woven into the civil government, and flouri&s;hed under the protection of the emperors'
<PB N="404" REF="029927_0428_0FE33A9807336DF8">
men's thoughts and di&s;cour&s;es were, as they are now, full of &s;ecular affairs; but in the three fir&s;t centuries of Chri&s;tianity, men who embraced this religion, had given up all their intere&s;ts in this world, and lived in a perpetual preparation for the next, as not know|ing how &s;oon they might be called to it: &s;o that they had little el&s;e to talk of but the life and doctrines of that divine Per&s;on which was their hope, their encouragement, and their glory.</P>
<P>WE cannot imagine, that there was a &s;ingle per&s;on arrived at any degree of age or con|&s;ideration, who had not heard and repeated above a thou&s;and times in his life, all the parti|culars of our Saviour's birth, life, death, re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion; e&s;pecially if we con&s;i|der that they could not then be received as Chri&s;tians, till they had undergone &s;everal exami|nations. Per&s;ons of riper years, who flocked daily into the church during the three fir&s;t cen|turies, were obliged to pa&s;s through many repeated in&s;tructions, and give a &s;trict account of their proficiency, before they were admitted to bapti&s;m. And as for tho&s;e who were born of Chri&s;tians parents and had been baptized in their infancy, they were, with the like care, prepared and di&s;ciplined for confirmation, which they could not arrive at, till they were found upon examination to have made a &s;ufficient progre&s;s in the knowledge of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t further ob&s;erve, that there was not only in tho&s;e times this religious conver&s;ation among&s;t private Chri&s;tians, but a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence between the churches that were e&s;tabli&s;hed by the apo&s;tles or their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in the &s;everal parts of the world. If any new doctrine was &s;tated, or any fact reported of our Saviour, a &s;trict inquiry was made among&s;t the churches, e&s;pecially tho&s;e planted by the apo&s;tles them&s;elves, whether they had received any &s;uch doctrine or account of our Saviour, from the mouths of the apo&s;tles, or the tradi|tion of the Chri&s;tians&punc; who had preceded the pre&s;ent members of the churches, which were thus con&s;ulted. By this means, when any novelty was publi&s;hed, it was immediately detected and cen&s;ured.</P>
<P>ST. JOHN, who lived &s;o many years after our Saviour, was appealed to in tho&s;e emer|gencies, as the living oracle of the church; and as his oral te&s;timony la&s;ted the fir&s;t cen|tury, many have ob&s;erved, that, by a particular providence of God, &s;everal of our Sa|viour's di&s;ciples, and of the early converts of his religion, lived to a very great age&punc; that they might per&s;onally convey the truth of the go&s;pel to tho&s;e times, which were very re|mote from the fir&s;t publication of it. Of the&s;e, be&s;ides St. John we have a remarkable in&s;tance in Simeon, who was one of the &s;eventy &s;ent forth by our Saviour, to publi&s;h the go&s;pel before his crucifixion, and a near kin&s;man to our Lord.</P>
<P>THIS venerable per&s;on, who had probably heard with his own ears, our Saviour's pro|phecy of the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, pre&s;ided over the church e&s;tabli&s;hed in that ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, during the time of its memorable &s;iege, and drew his congregation out of tho&s;e dread|ful and unparalleled calamities which befell his countrymen, by following the advice our Saviour had given, when they &s;hould &s;ee Jeru&s;alem encompa&s;&s;ed with armies, and the Roman &s;tandards, or abomination of de&s;olation, &s;et up. He lived till the year of our Lord 107, when he was martyred under the emperor Trajan.</P>
<P>IRENAEUS very aptly remarks, that tho&s;e barbarous nations, who in his time were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the written go&s;pels, and had only learned the hi&s;tory of our Saviour from tho&s;e who had converted them to Chri&s;tianity before the go&s;pels were written, had among&s;t them the &s;ame accounts of our Saviour, which are to be met with in the four evange|li&s;ts; an inconte&s;table proof of the harmony and concurrence between the holy &s;cripture and the tradition of the churches in tho&s;e early times of Chri&s;tianity. Thus we &s;ee what opportunities the learned and inqui&s;itive Heathens had of informing them&s;elves of the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, during the three fir&s;t centuries, e&s;pecially as they lay nearer one than another to the fountain-head; be&s;ides which there were many uncon|troverted traditions, records of Chri&s;tianity, and particular hi&s;tories, that then threw light into the&s;e matters, but are now entirely lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="029927_0429_0FE33B47F48553E8">WE cannot omit that which appears to us a &s;tanding miracle in the three fir&s;t centuries, namely, that amazing and &s;upernatural courage or patience which was &s;hewn by innume|rable multitudes of martyrs, in tho&s;e &s;low and painful torments that were inflicted on them. We cannot conceive a man placed in the burning iron chair at Lyons, amid&s;t the in&s;ults and mockeries of a crowded amphitheatre, and &s;till keeping his &s;eat; or &s;tretched upon a grate of iron, over coals of fire, and breathing out his &s;oul among&s;t the exqui&s;ite &s;uf|ferings of &s;uch a tedious execution, rather than renounce his religion, or bla&s;pheme his Saviour. Such trials &s;eem to us above the &s;trength of human nature, and able to over|bear duty, rea&s;on, faith, conviction, nay, and the mo&s;t ab&s;olute certainty of a future &s;tate. Humanity una&s;&s;i&s;ted in an extraordinary manner, mu&s;t have &s;haken off the pre&s;ent pre&s;&s;ure, and have delivered it&s;elf out of &s;uch a dreadful di&s;tre&s;s, by any means that could have been &s;ugge&s;ted to it. We can ea&s;ily imagine, that many per&s;ons, in &s;o good a cau&s;e, might have laid down their lives at the gibbet, the &s;take, or the block: but to expire lei&s;urely among&s;t the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tortures, when they might come out of them, even by a mental re&s;ervation, or an hypocri&s;y, which was not without a po&s;&s;ibility of being followed by a repentance and forgivene&s;s, has &s;omthing in it &s;o far beyond the natural &s;trength of mor|tals, that one cannot but think there was &s;ome miraculous power to &s;upport the &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>WE find the church of Smyrna, in that admirable letter which gives an account of the death of Poycap, their beloved bi&s;hop, mentioning the cruel torments of other early mar|tyrs of Chri&s;tianity, are of opinion, that our Saviour &s;tood by them in a vi&s;ion, and per|&s;onally conver&s;ed with them, to give &s;trength and comfort during the bitterne&s;s of their long-continued agonies; and we have the &s;tory of a young man, who having &s;uffered many tortures, e&s;caped with life, and told his fellow Chri&s;tians, that the pain of them had been rendered tolerable, by the pre&s;ence of an angel who &s;tood by him, wiped off the tears and &s;weat, which ran down his face whil&s;t he lay under his &s;ufferings. We are a&s;&s;ured, at lea&s;t, that the fir&s;t martyr for Chri&s;tianity, was encouraged in his la&s;t moments, by a vi&s;ion of that divine Per&s;on, for whom he &s;ufferd, and into who&s;e pre&s;ence he was then ha&s;tening.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that the deaths and &s;ufferings of the primative Chri&s;tians had a great &s;hare in the conver&s;ion of tho&s;e learned Pagans, who lived in the ages of per&s;ecution, which with &s;ome intervals and abatements, la&s;ted near three hundred years after our Saviour. Ju&s;tin Martyr, Tertullian, Lactantius, Arnobius, and others, tell us, that this fir&s;t of all alarmed their curio&s;ity, rou&s;ed their attention, and made them &s;eriou&s;ly inqui&s;itive into the nature of that religion, which could endue the mind with &s;o much &s;trength, and overcome the fear of death, nay, rai&s;e an earne&s;t de&s;ire of it, though it appeared in all its terrors. This they found had not been affected by all the doctrines of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, whom they had thoroughly &s;tudied, and who had been labouring at this great point. The &s;ight of the&s;e dying and tormented martyrs, engaged them to &s;earch into the hi&s;tory and doctrines of him for whom they &s;uffered.&mdash;The more they &s;earched, the more they were convinced: till their conviction grew &s;o &s;trong, that they them&s;elves embraced the &s;ame truths, and either actually laid down their lives, or were always in a readine&s;s to do it, rather than depart from them.</P>
<P>THERE are predictions of our Saviour recorded by the evangeli&s;ts, which were not completed till after their deaths, and had no likelihood of being &s;o, when they were pro|nounced by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour.&mdash;Such was that wonderful notice he gave them, that they &s;hould be brought before governors and kings for his &s;ake, for a te&s;timony again&s;t them and the Gentiles, Math. x.18. with the other like prophecies, by which he fore|told that his di&s;ciples were to be per&s;ecuted.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="029927_0430_0FE33B4977603178">ORIGEN in&s;i&s;ts with great &s;trength, on that wonderful prediction of our Saviour concern|ing the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, pronounced at a time, as he ob&s;erves, when there was no likelihood nor appearance of it. This has been taken notice of and inculcated by &s;o many others, that we &s;hall refer you to what this father has &s;aid on the &s;ubject in his fir&s;t book again&s;t Cel&s;us. And as to the accompli&s;hment of this remarkable prophecy, &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that whoever reads the account given us by Jo&s;ephus, without knowing his cha|racter, and compares it with what our Saviour foretold, would think the hi&s;torian had nothing el&s;e in view but to adju&s;t the event to the prediction.</P>
<P>THE ancient Chri&s;tians were &s;o entirely per&s;uaded of the force of our Saviour's pro|phecies, and of the puni&s;hment which the Jews had drawn upon them&s;elves, and upon their children: for the treatment which the Me&s;&s;iah had received at their hands that they did not doubt but they would always remain an abandoned and di&s;per&s;ed people, and hi&s;|&s;ing and an a&s;toni&s;hment among&s;t the nations, as they are to this day. In &s;hort, that they had lo&s;t their peculiarity of being God's people, which was now transferred to the body of Chri&s;tians, and which pre&s;erved the church of CHRIST among&s;t all the conflicts, difficulties, and per&s;ecutions in which it was engaged, as it had pre&s;erved the Jewi&s;h government and oeconomy for &s;o many ages, whil&s;t it had the &s;ame truth and vital prin|ciple in it, notwith&s;tanding it was &s;o frequently in danger of being utterly aboli&s;hed and de&s;troyed. Origen, in his fourth book again&s;t Cel&s;us, mentioning their being ca&s;t out of Jeru&s;alem, to which their wor&s;hip was annexed, deprived of their temple and &s;a|crifice, their religious rites and &s;olemnities, and &s;cattered over the face of the earth, ventures to a&s;&s;ure them with a face of confidence, that they would never be re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, &s;ince they had committed that horrid crime again&s;t the Saviour of the world. This was a bold a&s;&s;ertion in the good man, who knew how this people had been &s;o wonder|fully re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in former times, when they were almo&s;t &s;wallowed up, and in the mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;tate of de&s;olation, as in their deliverance out of the Babyloni&s;h captivity, and the oppre&s;&s;ions of Antiochus Epiphanes: nay he knew that within le&s;s than an hun|dred years before his own time, the Jews had made &s;uch a powerful effort for their re|e&s;tabli&s;hment under Barchocab, in the reign of Adrian, as &s;hook the whole Roman em|pire: but he founded his opinion on a &s;ure word of prophecy, and on the puni&s;hment they had &s;o ju&s;tly incurred; and we find by a long experience of fifteen hundred years, that he was not mi&s;taken, nay, that his opinion gathers &s;trength daily, &s;ince the Jews are now at a greater di&s;tance from any probability of &s;uch a re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, than they were when Origen wrote.</P>
<P>IN the primitive times, the Chri&s;tian religion &s;hewed its full force and efficacy on the minds of men, and many examples demon&s;trated what great and generous &s;ouls it was capable of producing. It exalted and refined its pro&s;elytes to a very high degree of perfection, and &s;et them far above the plea&s;ures, and even the pains, of this life. It &s;trengthened the infirmity, and broke the fiercene&s;s of human nature. It lifted up the minds of the ignorant to the knowledge and wor&s;hip of him that made them, and in|&s;pired the vicious with a rational devotion, a &s;trict purity of heart, and an unbounded love to their fellow-creatures. In proportion as it &s;pread through the world, it &s;eem|ed to change mankind into another &s;pecies of beings. No &s;ooner was a convert initia|ted into it, but by an ea&s;y figure he became a new man, and both acted and looked upon him&s;elf as one re-generated and born a &s;econd time into another &s;tate of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>BUT we find no argument made a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the&s;e eminent Pa|gan converts, for &s;trengthening their faith in the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, than the predictions
<PB N="407" REF="029927_0431_0FE33B54460FC9D0">
relating to him in tho&s;e old prophetic writings, which were depo&s;ited among&s;t the hands of the greate&s;t enemies to Chri&s;tianity, and owned by them to have been extant many ages before his appearance. The learned Heathen converts were a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee the whole hi&s;tory of their Saviour's life publi&s;hed before he was born, and to find that the evangeli&s;ts and prophets, in their accounts of the Me&s;&s;iah, differed only in point of time, the one foretelling what &s;hould happen to him, and the other de&s;cribing tho&s;e very particulars at what had actually happened. This our Saviour him&s;elf was plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of as the &s;tronge&s;t argument of his being the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, and without it would hardly have reconciled his di&s;ciples to the ignominy of his death, as in that remarkable pa&s;&s;age which mentions his conver&s;ation with the two di&s;ciples, on the day of his re&s;urrection, St. Luke xxiv.13. to the end. Be&s;ides the Heathen converts after having travelled through all human learning, and fortified their minds with the knowledge of arts and &s;ciences, were particularly qualified to examine the&s;e prophecies with great care and impartiality, and without prejudice or propo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;o as to e&s;tabli&s;h in their minds the firm belief of the truth and excellency of the Chri&s;tian religion, beyond the lea&s;t degree of a doubt concerning it.</P>
