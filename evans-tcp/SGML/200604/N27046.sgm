<HEAD>ORATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE invisible atom, which floats in the air, has its use, and aids in balancing the universe; possibly, therefore, neither the obscurity of our situation, nor the inability of the Speaker may exclude benefit from the present hour.</P>
<P>May not this apologize for our zeal of adding a spark to the flame, which now bursts from Memphremagog to St. Mary's tide?</P>
<P>IF the birth of a hero, or legislator, be celebra|ted with gladness, the natal day of an Empire ought not to be forgotten. This day a nation was born.</P>
<P>AMERICA now gratefully reviews her past, re|joices in her present, and, with rapture, anticipates her future scenes.</P>
<P>About the year 1602 the Fathers of New Eng|land separated from the rest of mankind, and en|tered into covenant with one another.</P>
<P>GIVING up human forms and creeds, they en|gaged to honor God with a worship purely scrip|tural. Meeting with opposition from their neigh|bors, on account of their puritanic simplicity, they exiled themselves to Leyden, a City of the Netherlands.</P>
<P>DIFFICULTIES pursuing them, they resolved to cross the Atlantic, to seek an asylum in the woods of America.</P>
<P>A VESSEL is provided for a part, who prepare the way for the rest.</P>

THEY descend to the wharf. Those, who are to tarry, unite with the adventurers, and contin|ue their devotion while wind and tide permit. Never did angels view a scene, more social or tender.</P>
<P>ON the 5th of Aug. 1620, they failed; on the 9th of Nov. they descried the principal Cape of these shores; on the 25th of Dec. they began to erect the first House of New-England.</P>
<P>IN less than three months more than half were stricken by the hand of death. About 50 sur|vive. These lay the base of an empire.</P>
<P>HAVING sacrificed all, that men hold dear, for the enjoyment of rational liberty, they were jea|lous of their rights; they ever boldly remonstra|ted on the least appearance of tyranny.</P>
<P>IN 1765, in consequence of an oppressive act of the British parliament, opposition assumed a bold|er tone. The fire of freedom blazed. The flame spread through the provinces. The conflagrati|on was general.</P>
<P>THE obnoxious act was repealed. Britons were pleased, the flags of the Thames were dis|played, the streets of London illuminated, Ame|rica was glad. But in 1767 provocation was a|gain given, and again burst forth the flame of li|berty.</P>
<P>IN Committees, Conventions, and Congresses, opposition was organized.</P>
<P>ON the 19th of April 1775, we were compelled to adopt a new stile of resistance. The plains of Lexington and Concord were drenched in blood. Death-daring Putnam on the heights of Charles|ton
<PB N="5" REF="036037_0004_10083D66AAF227E8">
soon taught the veterans of Briton a lesson, never to be forgotten.</P>
<P>ON July 4th, 1776, while formidable fleets and armies darkened our coasts, INDEPENDENCE was declared.</P>
<P>AFTER a long, a bloody contest, a series of sieges, of battles, of incredible hardships, after the flight of St. Clair had opened a field for the valor of Gates on the banks of the Hudson; af|ter a Washington had terminated the marches of Cornwallis at Yorktown; in 1782 our independ|ence was acknowledged by the court of London.</P>
<P>THE God of armies carried us through the dis|mal struggle. He put the flag of triumph in our hands. Peace was proclaimed. The war-worn Veteran retired to plow the field, his courage had secured; to level the mounds, and sow the har|vest in the foot-steps of the flying foe.</P>
<P>IN a few years there was found energy to con|ceive, and wisdom to adopt the Federal Consti|tution, the boast of man and the wonder of the world. Even Jacobins have not, in general, waded so far in the mire of depravity as to slan|der this Ark of our safety. Under the adminis|tration of a Washington and an Adams we have enjoyed prosperity. Wealth has incalculably en|creased; industry prevailed; the means of mo|ral and intellectual improvement multiplied.&mdash;Long, long may they live to honor the Christian name; to bless the world with their Codlike services.</P>
<P>SHOULD any stranger in our Israel enquire, as the man of Seir did of the prophet in Judah's court, Watchman what of the night? We must

answer in the stile of cautious diffidence: Yet might we not reply? The morning cometh&mdash;is come. The morn of civil and religious freedom. Here is her permanent home. The heavenly vi|sitant dwells in our houses, in our churches, is our companion in every walk. She diffuses cheerful ease, gives energy to every exertion.</P>
<P>UNDER her genial smiles, the sails of commerce whiten every sea; labor sings, as she reaps the field, she sowed; science unfolds her mysteries; religion leads her holy train to heaven.</P>
<P>WHAT a contrast with the Hag of France, na|med Liberty and Equality. She tyrannizes over the souls and bodies of men, punishes without the form of a trial, persecutes religion, tramples on all law: She gorges four million of her own children and cries, 'Give, give:' she tears out the vitals of her enemies, and with malice more re|fined spreads moral death among her friends; She moves, and the river of Egypt is blood, the vales of Palestine a dreary desert.</P>
<P>THE time of the day is somewhat evident. The angel is pouring out the sixth vial of the divine wrath. Euphrates, or the defence of spiritual Ba|bylon, is drying up.</P>
<P>WHETHER her strength consists in her military force, in bigotry and superstition, in her prodi|gious revenues, in the ecclesiastic orders devoted to her service, she is sinking. Like the falling tem|ple of Dagon, when Sampson shook the pillars, she spreads death around.</P>
<P>PROBABLY the last drops of this vial are falling. Other events, <HI>mentioned</HI> after this vial, have taken place, or are now existing. <HI>Rev.</HI> 16&mdash;13, 14.&mdash;

"And I saw THREE <HI>unclean</HI> spirits, like frogs, come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirit of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.'</P>
<P>AT first THREE,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Though it is never wise to apply figures or prophecies too minutely, yet no sentence or word is inserted at random. The exile of <HI>Patmos</HI> saw 'THREE unclean spirits..'</P>
<P>Barruel says, "About the middle of this century, there appeared THREE men leagued against christianity, Voltaire, d'Alembert, Frederic." Again, "It was the coalition of the adepts of <HI>impiety,</HI> of the adepts of <HI>rebellion,</HI> and the adepts of <HI>anarchy,</HI> which formed the club of the jacobins. Un|der this name, common to the TIRPLE sect, we shall see the a|depts following up their TRIPLE conspiracy.</P></NOTE> or a small number of Agents are seen. They are unclean, as frogs. Bold and intruding, like those of Egypt, which entered the houses, the chambers, and the beds; they pro|ceed from the 'dragon' or satan. They have his rebellious spirit. They proceed from 'the beast' or civil power of Antichrist: from 'the false prophet,' or antichristian church. They are the spontaneous fruit of her pious frauds, her super|stition and ignorance.</P>
<P>THEY are not <HI>like,</HI> they <HI>are</HI> the spirit of devils. They work miracles or effect wonders. Their influence is inconceivably great. They go forth to the kings or governments of the earth; to those, who have the greatest influence in society. Not having power, by intrigue, by deceit, by 'skill' they engage them to fight against God, to crush his cause. In a most wonderful man|ner these things have been accomplished. Glance
<PB N="8" REF="036037_0007_10083D6D6EB03988">
an eye to Europe. These things are visible in real life.</P>
<P>AMONG the sober people of Germany, shelter|ed by the civil laws of antichrist, from the bosom of the Romish church, in the spirit of the adver|sary, such a combination springs into existance.</P>
<P>IT was reserved for Weishaupt, whose name would figure in a biography of Devils, to organ|ize a society to overturn all the governments and religions of the world: A society, which for de|pravity of design and address in execution, far exceeds any scheme of Lucifer, any plot of re|bellion conceived in the councils of hell: A socie|ty, which would indubitably place its author first in the catalogue of the damned, were he not ri|valed in impiety by d'Alembert, Frederic and Voltaire.</P>
<P>THEY taught that conjugal faithfulness, chasti|ty and all the moral virtues, were mere prejudi|ces of education; that modesty was resined vo|luptuousness; that self-murder was no crime; that the possession of property infringed on hu|man rights, that the motive justifies the means; that civil government is the only fall of man; that there is no future state&mdash;no God. These o|pinions are propagated over countries, inhabited by more than a hundred million souls.</P>
<P>THE apostles of these doctrines introduced each other into every department of the community. They sat in the reviewers chair; they guided the public taste for books; they taught in the schools; they lectured in the universities; they prescribed to the sick; they were the tutors of Princes; they hovered round the throne, and directed the scep|tre.
<PB N="9" REF="036037_0008_10083D709C815530">
To finish this climax of guilt, they ascend|ed the Pulpit, and with unhallowed lips, pervert|ed the truth, and polluted the pages of God.</P>
<P>THIS society, after extending itself through Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Italy, was formally introduced to Paris, to all France. The persevering industry, the indefatigable pains, with which they pursued their object, would have honored a better cause.</P>
<P>THEIR secret papers have been discovered, which prove there are 2660 of these lodges in the world; seventeen of which are in the United States. How many more there may be, it is not easy to conjecture. These were the mines, the explosion of which has effected a revolution, an|swerable to such a cause.</P>
<P>THESE dens of impiety vomit forth their con|tents, and in one day a million of men start up in arms to overturn altars and thrones, to destroy government and religion. Enlightened by sci|ence, assuming the name of Philosophers, they have access to the highest class of society. Poison|ing the hearts of kings and rulers of States, by art they persuade them to combine to crush the son of God, to raze his empire from its founda|tion. Atheism, immorality and brutism haunt their steps.</P>
<P>THE sabbath disappears, religion flies, man is the prey of man.</P>
<P>THEIR influence has effected "miracles." The world is amazed at their progress. "Satan, when seeking vengeance against his divine creator, would have been proud to become the pupil of
<PB N="10" REF="036037_0009_10083D72F12B3438">
this modern Spartacus." From the Dykes of Holland to the tomb of Virgil, to the pillar of Pompey, they have "gathered" numerous armies to fight with God Almighty.</P>
<P>THE battle is now raging, millions have fallen, millions will fall, till "an angel standing in the sun shall cry with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven: Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God, that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great." The blood flows and will "flow to the horses bridles." These are the mi|racles of the unclean spirits. These are the won|ders of Illuminism.</P>
<P>YET when a learned Abbe founded the alarm in 1797, and proclaimed this conspiracy against heaven and earth, Incredulity rejected the story as impossible; but, when in 1798 all places of christian worship were abolished in Paris, the na|tions of christendom were shocked.</P>
<P>HEATHEN gods had their temples, but not a single altar was consecrated to the Almighty Fa|ther or the divine Savior&mdash;Him they blasphem|ed&mdash;they swore "to crush the wretch."</P>
<P>TH<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> illuminated Reviewers and Masons, trem|bling for the honor of the craft, elaborate the forced sneer against those, who have given the most important information to mankind&mdash;<HI>it is too late.</HI> The existence of such a society is <HI>certain</HI> in the public mind. We have only to quote a passage from a respectable Mason<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. MANN.</NOTE> to silence all
<PB N="11" REF="036037_0010_10083D758D887658">
cavils. He says, "That societies, called illumi|nati, have for some years existed in Germany, and from thence have extended themselves into other parts of Europe, whose object has been to overturn arbitrary governments and even chris|tianity itself, cannot be reasonably controverted."</P>
<P>Their future sarcasms, therefore, ought to be viewed, as the flutterings of a wounded bird in its last agonies.</P>
<P>BUT again the masonic Doctor enquires, "Are Masons to be accountable for the villany and de|generacy of the illuminati? Or is their institution to be debased, because societies exist, who have assumed its denomination and have under it dis|tracted the world by their principles of impiety and disorganization?" We answer: No. Neither do we "debase" the American masons on account of the illuminati&mdash;excepting those who show such resentment on their behalf. May not char|ity, pure as the heart of masonry, suspect a con|nection between two persons, when one volun|tarily receives the blow, aimed only at the other?</P>
<P>WHEN Masons cease to hurl their darts against the historians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robison, Barruel, Morse.</NOTE> of illuminism, they will not "be accountable for their villany and degeneracy."</P>
<P>IF it be enquired again: "Watchman what of the night?" We answer, in connection with these events, a warning, a threatening, a promise, is published to the christian world.</P>
<P>THE king of kings says:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvi.&mdash;15, 10.</NOTE> "Behold I come as a thief." These astonishing evils, which have been mentioned, shall come unexpectedly, imper|ceptibly, shall not be distinguished from other vi|sitations,
<PB N="12" REF="036037_0011_10083D777A0034A0">
'till they are in great part accomplished. Decked with the name of Liberty, muffled in the trappings of philosophy, the enemy flatters to be|tray, and smiles till the fatal stab is given.</P>
<P>"BLESSED is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments" clean. As the pious houses of Egypt were blest, not visited by the unclean frogs, so blessed are they, who recognize the baleful de|signs of these children of the dragon; who abhor the disorganizing systems of the day. But those, who do not watch, who do not escape the dead|ly contagion, shall discover "the nakedness," the baseness of their hearts, and be detested by all good men.</P>
<P>PERSONS, families, communities, nations, who do not separate from this foe to human nature, shall drink the cup of her plagues. Already this prophecy or threatning begins to be fulfilled.</P>
<P>A MAN must shut his eyes, and like the adder stop his ears, not to see the shame, and hear the sighs of those, who unite with the unclean spirits, the atheists of the age. The world, the attend|ing universe must confess: "Those who partake in their sins, receive their plagues." From a lofty summit of Switzerland, glance an eye round their fertile vales. A short time since their fields were loaded with corn, their pastures white with flocks, their mountains blushing with vines, their houses the abode of every joy, their churches resounding with holy song.</P>
<P>BEHOLD the change. Their vineyards are trod|den by the foot of Desolation; property is plun|dered; smoaking towns and villages hide their towering cliffs; widows and orphans, frantic on
<PB N="13" REF="036037_0012_10083D7A03EDD818">
the hill of slaughter, call for their husbands, their fathers and their sons. "The blood of the just flows, crimes triumph, hell is let loose." These people received the Missionaries of Atheism; they listened to the whispers of their impiety; they were charmed with the prattle of their philoso|phy; they were illuminized; they were undone.</P>
<P>So the revolutionary Serpent was received into paradise, and damnation followed.</P>
<P>UNHAPPY people, humanity weeps over your fall. Had you bid defiance to the slaves of France, submitted to the expence of defending yourselves, and been faithful to your God, you might have secured your farms, your domestic delights, all the blessings of your fathers' valor; but now all, all are lost. Ye partook the sins of your Savior's foe&mdash;ye receive his miseries.</P>
<P>NEW witnesses rise. See the depressed Hol|lander groaning under his new task masters: the wretched Belgian mourning over a beggared priesthood, a ruined country.</P>
<P>TURN to Italy. All is sad and desolate. Princes and kings are fled. The palace is solitary. The cottage is in tears, or swept away in a torrent of blood. They accepted the doctrines of illumin|ism; they escape not the plagues.</P>
<P>BE warned, oh my country, to fly the fatal abyss. To put the least confidence in French promises; to hazard any thing dear on the sin|cerity of their treaties, would be, like failing to the torrid zone in a ship of ice. Their friendship, to remedy our woes, would be like the hissing lava of Vesuvius to quench the thirst of his burn|ing atmosphere.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="036037_0013_10083D7D6F257158">
AN alliance with them, like the Syroc of Italy, would waft death and ruin to our shores.</P>
<P>IF our country make a common interest with them; our government will vanish; our name be blotted from the catalogue of nations. The officer, signing the instrument, with his country falls.</P>
<P>HAD I a voice to be heard, I would say, Be warned, all ye nations of the earth. Approach not the raging, dying monster. His contagion is the sting of death.</P>
<P>IF being "drunk with the blood of the saints," if "forbidding to marry," or abolishing the or|dinance itself, if "blaspheming God," if "de|ceiving those who dwell on the earth," if "changing times and laws" constitute a charac|ter, is it not visible? Is there not a power, which "as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God?"</P>
<P>THOSE, who in imagination have demolished the throne of God, and revolutionized the uni|verse, have exalted themselves above kings, in scripture called gods. They have, as God, di|rected in the temple of God. Did the Almighty more, minutely, model the worship of Israel, than they have that of their country? Have not they changed the time, and the agents, and the doc|trines, and the object of worship? Have they not formally made gods of one another, "shewing that they <HI>are</HI> gods?"</P>
<P>MIRABEAU and Marat have received religious adoration. The people of France HAVE bowed the knee to those Demons of vice. Have they not a claim, to have it acknowledged, that they
<PB N="15" REF="036037_0014_10083D7FE0A06AC0">
as God, sit in the temple of God, 'showing them|selves that they are God?'</P>
<P>FINALLY&mdash;It is a time of day that requires cautious jealousy. Not jealousy of your Magis|trates, for you have given them your confidence, but of those who slander their administration.</P>
<P>SUSPECT not an Adams, or Washington; but those, who blaspheme their unspotted virtues. To be jealous of your Rulers would be, as if a per|son were to choose him a bride from all the beau|ties of the world, and then, instantly, without cause, be jealous of her alone. Your public cha|racters are your own CHOICE. Depending on your support, they have accepted the arduous, the difficult, the dangerous post. Unless the good sense of America be a chimera, they are doubtless the best men of the world.</P>
<P>WATCH those ungrateful souls, who murmur about taxation and oppression, the burdens of government and religion. They have fellowship with our enemies&mdash;they are traitors to God and christianity.</P>
<P>BE jealous of those, who preach about gratitude to France for her insidious favors. She help to break <HI>our</HI> CHAINS! Thank GOD, <HI>we</HI> never wore any. Where are the scars of the galling bolts? Where is the wood we hewed; the water we drew? Where the mad frenzy, shewn by the boasting slaves themselves, while changing the flax|encords of monarchical tyranny, for the iron chains of military despotism? No, my countrymen, you never were in bondage to any man. Your Parent, suspicious of your filial obedience shook a rod.&mdash;You rose, you seized, you shivered it to atoms.
<PB N="16" REF="036037_0015_10083D81C200B5E8">
Have those <HI>creatures</HI> so <HI>mighty</HI> thankful to France, ever shewn any remarkable gratitude to the poor soldier of the revolutionary war? to a Washing|ton, an Adams for their long, their useful servi|ces; for their dignified fortitude under the tem|pests of their <HI>calumnies?</HI></P>
<P>A MARBLE eye it is, that drops not the tear of grateful affection, viewing these pillars, which support the social and moral world, amid crashing temples and falling empires.</P>
<P>THE gratitude of a jacobin, like the plague, ap|pears in spots; and like the plague, it is a deadly disease. Be jealous of those, who declaim against alien and sedition laws; they probably, have a hankering for lying and rebellion themselves.</P>
<P>IN a word, let honest men, let the friends to God and humanity, spurn from their embrace every man, who trifles with his fathers' religion, the hope and salvation of the world; who alarms weak minds with the designs of government;&mdash;who discourages the most FORMIDABLE means of defence.</P>
<P>MENTIONING the means of defence I spontane|ously address the military present. It was the sword, which gave courage to <HI>declare</HI> INDEPEND|ENCE. Such is the present state of human nature, that nothing but the sword can <HI>defend</HI> our INDEPEND|ENCE. Under God, you my fellow Citizens, are our defence and our hope. To you and your bro|ther soldiers, your parents, your wives, your children, your ministers, look up for protection, for safety, for every comfort.</P>
<P>IF the American soldiery lay aside their arms, how soon, how very soon, would the blaze of
<PB N="17" REF="036037_0016_10083D857AEF91F8">
your habitations give double horror to the car|nage of the night; how soon would your religion be banished&mdash;yourselves slaves&mdash;your wives&mdash;your sisters&mdash;But, Oh forbid it heaven, forbid it, ye brave warriors of America.</P>
<P>IF your vengeance burn <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ot, the shades of a Standish, a Church, and other venerable soldiers of New-England would indignant rise and drive the blaspheming columns from the land; never would they see the tree, planted in their blood, bear fruit for the enemies of their God. Never, never while there is a crimson drop in your hearts will you suffer an armed foe to breathe your na|tive air. At a distance the tempest roars; we see the lightnings blaze, we hear the thunders roll; it may soon reach your fields, your houses; desolation follows the storm. Should your coun|try call, should martial music rouse your slum|bering swords; rise, <HI>rise,</HI> repel the ungodly foe. Cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood; let him, who hath none, sell his coat and buy one.</P>
<P>YOUR cause is the cause of God. Your enemy is the enemy of God.</P>
<P>BEFORE they threatened <HI>you,</HI> they had declared war against GOD, against <HI>the</HI> DIVINE SAVIOR.</P>
<P>IN the councils of heaven, they are already de|stroyed, and given to the fowls of the air.</P>
<P>WHAT have you to fear from such an enemy? As surely, as God, the Governor of the universe, is almighty, they shall fall.</P>
<P>THE contest is desirable. The most obstinate war with Anti-Christ is safer than peace. Peace
<PB N="18" REF="036037_0017_10083D88C7706F28">
may introduce their daring vices, their unex|ampled atheism; unexampled it is, for hell be|lieves and trembles.</P>
<P>GO, then, be the soldiers of God. Like David assaulting the giant of Gath, go in the name of the God of battles. Go and conquer; then shall there be a new song in heaven&mdash;"BABYLON is fallen&mdash;is fallen."</P>
