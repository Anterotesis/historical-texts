<HEAD>1. I di to Al myn'.</HEAD>
<L>T<HI>O All mine</HI> Earthly Joys and Friends <HI>I dy,</HI></L>
<L>To whatsoe're below the Sun doth ly;</L>
<L>To <HI>All</HI> that shadow cast, and hastes to change;</L>
<L>To <HI>All</HI> that is pursu'd within the Range</L>
<L>Of Sublunary Vain's, toss'd to and fro</L>
<L>Of sons of men that seek to th'Pit to go.</L>
<L><HI>I dy</HI> to Husband, Children, Parents dear:</L>
<L><HI>Mine</HI> they were once, I theirs; ('twixt hope and fear</L>
<L>No unmix'd Sweet I found) But now no more</L>
<L>These mine can be, as they were heretofore.</L>
<L>My Interest's translated up on High,</L>
<L>To things now mine, to which I ne're can dy.</L>
<L>Then happy Death, my welcome I'le thee give,</L>
<L>'Cause now to God and Christ I ever live.</L>

<HEAD>2. I di, not my Al.</HEAD>
<L>I <HI>Dy,</HI> 'tis true, but yet it's <HI>not</HI> my <HI>All,</HI></L>
<L>That with this dust into the Grave doth fall.</L>
<L>Life hath my Better part; which soon did post</L>
<L>By Angels Conduct, to the Heav'nly Host.</L>
<L>Life unto Life is gone, through th'Living way;</L>
<L>But that which Mortal was, makes yet some stay.</L>
<L>When Breath expir'd, my Life came flowing in;</L>
<L>My Soul reviv'd, made free from th'death of Sin,</L>
<L>New Light, new Love, new Joy me now do fill,</L>
<L>New Robes I have, new Company, new Skill</L>
<L>To sing th'new Song: Sure this is Life indeed;</L>
<L>My All's alive in dying thus to speed.</L>
<L>Naked o'th'Body, my Soul in Bliss is sheath'd</L>
<L>My Garland of ne're-dying Flow'rs is wreath'd.</L>
<L>Then nought but Dust is dead; at Life's Return</L>
<L>This also shall be quickned from its Urn:</L>
<L>My Death, my Grave, shall then for ever dy,</L>
<L>And Life shall Triumph in the Victory.</L>

<HEAD>3. Dai in my Lot.</HEAD>
<L>L ight sown is for the Righteous; its full Crop</L>
<L>Y ields Glory's Harvest, Souls fill'd up to th'top</L>
<L>D <HI>ay in my Lot</HI> is now, still calm, still bright.</L>
<L>I n leaving your dark World, I left all Night;</L>
<L>A scended where, nor Sun, nor Moon, we crave:</L>
<L>M y God, &amp; th'Lamb's the light that here we have.</L>
<L>I n his Light we see light, and light'ned stay;</L>
<L>N o light to that of th'Everlasting Day!</L>
<L>O pleasant Lines that thus are fall'n to me!</L>
<L>T o make that <HI>Day my Lot</HI> which aye shall be.</L>
