<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE three reasons for publishing what follows: The first, originates in a desire to obvi|ate those unfavourable impressions which the suggestions of ignorance and prejudice have caus|ed respecting the works which are the subject of this treatise, and to exhibit my plans to the judg|ment of sensible men, such as they <HI>really</HI> are.</P>
<P>The second, originates in a hope that in conse|quence of the success of the abovementioned de|sire, I may induce others to become adventurers in an undertaking, which in its promise of advan|tages embraces every individual in the union.</P>
<P>The third, though the least personally advan|tageous, not the least impressive on my mind, re|sults from a hope of being of some service to the country in which I live.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="033729_0005_0FF92931669E69E0">
While I am writing this preface, I think I may venture to assert, that there are not six men in the world who are perfectly acquainted with the principles upon which this undertaking has been founded; yet has it been in the mouths of thou|sands a subject of decided disapprobation, cen|sure and ridicule; many who have even disavow|ed having the smallest idea of the plan, have with a directorial assurance denounced the attempt in general as fruitless, and some have meanly dared to insinuate that I have adopted it as the vehicle of imposition on the public, and the forerunner of deception and fraud.</P>
<P>During a series of four years I have made the establishment of Salt Works in the United States, the primary object of my wishes, and every inter|vening employment (the variety of which has sometimes subjected me to the imputation of in|stability,) I have made subservient, to this one great object,&mdash;with an unshaken perseverance, fre|quently thought blameable, I have pursued it through innumerable obstacles, and under the most distressing embarrassments; and firmly con|fident of the eventual success, and the propriety of my own intentions, I <HI>will</HI> pursue it while I have life and sense, were it even possible that the diffi|culties
<PB N="9" REF="033729_0006_0FF8C665BB2F65D0">
I have already experienced from the pur|suit could be ten times trebled to oppose me.</P>
<P>In the flood tide of discouraging opinions, in the storms of insolent and insulting suggestions, I have erected my judgment and my integrity as my rock of rest. I have patiently suffered the waves to beat with violence against them in the most implicit confidence, that I shall one day or other withdraw them from the tempest perfectly honoured and uninjured. The object I am in pursuit of is great; necessity, every child is told, and truly so, is the mother of invention; (I con|fess it so of mine), and it, consequently, not un|frequently happens that where inventive minds allow the imagination free scope, the most exten|sive plans are conceived by persons the least ca|pable of executing them.</P>
<P>For the execution of my design I want money, and friends to the undertaking; if I procure them by this publication, my grand obstacle will be removed; and adventurers are hereby invited by an assurance on my part, of a conviction founded on experience, that the works will succeed at least so far as to yield such a profit as any reasonable man will be contented with.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="033729_0007_0FF92938F1684120">
If the following plan should be deemed by sen|sible men to be founded on philosophical princi|ples and reasonable prospects of success, a ques|tion will naturally occur, how so much time could have elapsed without my having placed myself in a situation to extend the works with|out the necessity of publishing to convince the world of their utility; I can only here remark, that I am unwilling to trouble the public with what does not concern them; but if any person, thinking favourably of the undertaking, should wish for further satisfaction than what is contain|ed in this publication, I shall at any time be ready to make it the subject of private communication.</P>
<P>Much might be urged on the political necessity of having such establishments within the United States, but the advantages thereof are too obvi|ous to every thinking mind to need any dilate discussion; the price of salt consequent on the difficulty of procuring it during the last war is fresh in the memory of every American, and the impossibility of its being dispensed with, is a con|sideration that should encourage such underta|kings upon terms much less favourable than those here proposed.</P>
<P>It is my wish that the undertaking, if approved of, should be forwarded by the purchase of shares
<PB N="11" REF="033729_0008_0FF9293B621203F0">
entitling the holders thereof to the delivery of an ascertained quantity of salt every year for ten years, that after the expiration of that term the claims of the purchasers should cease on the pay|ment of a stipulated sum by me, or my assigns.</P>
<P>It is my intention in order to accommodate all ranks of purchasers to issue these shares, in small portions, entitling the holders thereof to one hundred bushels per year for each; These shares will be delivered by me, at first, at 150 dollars each&mdash;100 dollars payable by the purchaser on the delivery of each share, and 50 dollars on the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="obscured" EXTENT="1 word"> delivery of the 1st 100 bushels of salt.</P>
<P>Reserving to myself the privilege at all times, in case of accidents, of remitting to the share holders, or their agents, cash at the rate of 75 per bushel for the quantity of salt due.</P>
<P>As the works progress, and the security of the shares becomes better ascertained, they will natu|rally rise in value and find their market price.</P>
<P>The number of shares issued by me or my agents at 150 dollars per share, shall not exceed two hundred. After these shall have been sold, the price of future shares will be raised as circum|stances
<PB N="12" REF="033729_0009_0FF929413A272948">
shall direct, and when fixed in price and number, public notice thereof shall be given to the original subscribers, and during a stipulated period they shall be allowed the exclusive privi|lege of purchase; after the expiration of which period the sale of the remaining shares shall be public.</P>
<P>Drawings of the works to which the following pages have reference are left at Mr. Shaw's me|dicinal warehouse Chesnut St. near the corner of 4th Street, where further explanations, if neces|sary, may be had.</P>
<P>My whole plan and intentions are now laid open to the public; if they think proper to en|courage the undertaking, I have no doubt but that in the course of a few years, the United States may be furnished with salt from their own fac|tories at as cheap, or perhaps a much cheaper rate, to every individual than that at which it is now purchased.</P>

<HEAD>SPECIFICATION of the Principles and Plan of a newly invented Machine for procuring Salt from Sea water or Salt springs, by JAMES FENNELL, citi|zen of the State of Pennsylvania.</HEAD>
<P>THE principle upon which this machine is founded, is that of producing the speediest eva|poration of the fresh particles of sea water or brine without the use of fire. This is effected through the medium of sand which operates in the three following capacities, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1st, As a retainer; by reserving when wetted with salt water a certain portion of it.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, As a destroyer of cohesion, by separating the particles of sea water.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, As an evaporator, by its natural repulsion of water, and by offering a greater quantity of surface thereof to the action of the Sun and Air.</P>
<P>This being the principle. Ten (more or less) wooden vats are constructed in a regular line, the one about a foot lower than the other, so that
<PB N="18" REF="033729_0011_0FF9294A29962DE0">
the water may empty itself with ease from the first into the second, and so on. These vats are furnished with two (or more) reservoirs, the one for the purpose of having always a quantity of salt water in readiness, of sufficient height to com|mand the whole of the works; the other, for the purpose of receiving the brine from the last vat, and keeping a supply of it in readiness for crystallization. The bottom of each vat is co|vered with sea sand, small gravel, or fine earth, about three inches deep.</P>
<P>The sand is for the purpose, of retaining in each vat when wetted a certain portion of sea water, and when raked and stirred about, of ex|posing the fresh particles thereof to evaporation; the salt remaining with the sand.</P>
<P>When, in consequence of frequent wettings and dryings, the sand becomes considerably impreg|nated with salt, the salt is extracted by washing the sand, by passing a quantity of sea water through each vat, from first to last, and raking and stir|ring up the sand and water in each as it passes, thereby making it dissolve the salt left with the sand in each, till, by repeated accumulations, it becomes in the last vat saturated with salt; when
<PB N="19" REF="033729_0012_0FF929541E644DD0">
it is drawn off into a covered reservoir, there to remain till all impurities have subsided; when, in fine weather it is drawn off, by such portions as are requisite, into a large shallow vat called a crystallizing canal, where, after being exposed a few hours it begins to crystallize, and the salt is removed at pleasure.</P>
<P>The principal always remaining the same, the number, size, and form of the vats may be vari|ed as local or other circumstances require.</P>

<HEAD>PLAN, and Description of a newly invented Machine for procuring Salt from the Sea water or Salt springs, with the Method of Working it; Observations &amp;c. by JAMES FENNELL, Citizen of the State of Pennsylvania.</HEAD>
<P>IT is necessary to premise that it would be at|tended with great difficulty, to exhibit one plan which would be suitable to all situations&mdash;local circumstances, such as inequality in the height of banks, differing positions of shores, and other causes may render requisite considerable varia|tions in the construction of the works, and the relative positions of the vats, pond, pumps, re|servoirs &amp;c. The principle, however, upon which this plan is founded, will remain the same under every variation in the mode of building. The most concise and explicit plan is therefore adopt|ed here, supposing the works to be erected on a level bank from six to twenty feet above the sur|face of the water.</P>
<P>The following description is divided into three subjects, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Explanation of the plan of the

buildings, with references to, and observations on each part thereof.</P>
<P>Method of working the Machinery.</P>
<P>And observations on the most effectual mode of regulating the work, of profiting by the ca|sual advantages of good weather, and lessening the casual disadvantages of bad weather.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="explanation of plan">
<HEAD>EXPLANATION OF THE PLAN OF THE WORKS.</HEAD>
<P>The Works consist of</P>
<P>(A) A Pond. This pond is for the purpose of receiving the sea water, at high tide, and re|taining a sufficient quantity thereof for the use of the works. By means of this pond, the works may, at the most convenient times, be supplied with the best sea water; and the natural evapora|tion therefrom during a period of fine weather, will considerably strengthen the water, and con|sequently enable the same quantity to yield more salt, than if immediately taken from the sea or river.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="033729_0015_0FF92963AA58FCF8">
(B), A pump.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Common hand pumps are exhibited in the drawing of this plan for the sake of conciseness, but it is to be understood that horse pumps are supposed to be used; at least where (as contemplated in this plan) the vats are of such a size as to re|quire a horse to rake the sand.</NOTE> This pump communicates with the pond, by means of a spout or tube; and is for the purpose of raising the water into the reservoir (C).</P>
<P>(C,) A reservoir, into which the water is rais|ed from the pond; this reservoir, being sheltered from the rains by the one above it, secures the water which has been strengthened in the pond, and being by one half nearer the pond than the other, the same force will secure double the quan|tity of water in the time requisite to raise it to the upper reservoir. And as the usual time for filling this reservoir will be on the apparent approach of rain, after the water has been strengthened by a continuance of fine weather, the nearer it can be brought to the level of the pond the better; that the necessary quantity of water may be the sooner secured; and both reservoirs being covered (though not so represented in the drawing,) the upper one may be being filled during the conti|nuance of misty or rainy weather, at which time
<PB N="23" REF="033729_0016_0FF9296897B98838">
the horse and man will have no other occupation in the works.</P>
<P>(D), A pump communicating with the lower reservoir and drawing the water therefrom into the upper reservoir (E).</P>
<P>(E), The upper reservoir of sufficient height to command the whole of the works. In this re|servoir, (which is covered,) a regular quantity of water is to be kept for the supply of the vats.</P>
<P>(F), Ten vats, about sixteen inches deep, the one lower than the other, so as to suffer the water to run off from the first to the second and so on. The bottoms of these vats are covered with sea sand about three inches deep regularly spread over them.</P>
<P>(G), A horse, and rake or fine harrow; this machine is for the purpose 1st. of stirring together the sand and water to enable the water the more effectually and speedily to dissolve the salt pre|viously left with the sand; and 2dly, after the water is drawn off, to rake the sand into little ridges, thereby exposing the greatest possible quantity of moist grains thereof to the action of
<PB N="24" REF="033729_0017_0FF9296B08D955C8">
the sun and air, and promoting the evaporation of the fresh particles of the sea water.</P>
<P>(H), A reservoir, to receive the brine satu|rated by the accumulation of saline particles du|ring the passage of the water through the vats. In this reservoir, (which has temporary covers,) the brine is left to settle and deposit its impurities, and is thence drawn off as wanted into the crystallizing canal (I).</P>
<P>(I), The crystallizing canal, (with sliding co|vers) into which the brine is let in fair weather for the purpose of extracting the salt. The brine, if perfectly saturated, being let into this canal about two inches deep on a fine warm day, will begin to crystallize in the course of a few hours and continue so to do till night, when, if the salt is wanted fine, it must be taken out; if coarse, a greater depth of brine must be admitted, and the salt suffered to crystallize unmolested for several days, care being taken every evening, and on the approach of rain, to cover the canal from the dews and bad weather.</P>
<P>(K), The warehouse, into which the salt is taken from the crystallizing canal. (L), The wharf.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="033729_0018_0FF8C63BAA033408">
The plan being drawn chiefly for the exempli|fication of the principle; it was thought necessary to exhibit it in the most simple shape; therefore, the little necessary appendages, which must be obvious to every mind, and which would only have created confusion in the drawing, have been omitted; such as, the covers to the reservoirs, the spouts, frames for the pumps, &amp;c. &amp;c. For the same reason <HI>one</HI> crystallizing canal only is in the plan, whereas it is necessary to have <HI>ten</HI> of the size of one vat, or <HI>one</HI> containing as many square feet as are contained in all the vats, that the crys|tallization may keep pace with the saturation of the water.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="method">
<PB REF="033729_0019_0FF92971AF0F9798">
<HEAD>METHOD OF WORKING THE MACHINES.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE describing the method of working the machines, I will suppose a regular succession of fine weather for several days, and afterwards observe on the consequences of rain, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Previously to the commencement of the regu|lar process, the works must be prepared in the following manner, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>The bottoms of the vats must be covered with sand about three inches deep regularly spread over them.</P>
<P>That done, the pond must be filled with water let in from the river by a sluice, which must be then stopped, and the reservoirs supplied with salt water.</P>
<P>That being done, the first vat must be supplied with water to the depth of nine inches (or there
<PB N="27" REF="033729_0020_0FF9297BD5A95960">
about) above the sand; (this quantity of water will be about sufficient to reach and wet the last; as the sand in each vat will absorb and retain about one third of its bulk of water, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> one inch). The water must then be drawn off from the first into the second, thence, into the third, and so on; the water will be found to diminish as it progresses, one inch in each vat, and by the tenth all that has reached it will be absorbed.</P>
<P>The vats being all wetted in this manner; the sand is immediately raked into ridges by the horse and machine (G), passing from one vat to the other, and is then left to dry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In fine weather the sand should be raked two or three times a-day.</NOTE>. The horse is then taken from the harrow and put to the pump, to supply the reservoirs with the quantity of wa|ter used in wetting the vats, of which the fresh particles evaporate, the sand becomes dry, and impregnated with salt.</P>
<P>This process of wetting and raking the sand, and re-supplying the reservoirs is the business of the first day. The same process must be repeated (for the sand will generally dry once in four and twenty hours) four or five days successively, after
<PB N="28" REF="033729_0021_0FF9298045C99910">
which the sand will be sufficiently impregnated with salt for the commencement of the regular work of making salt, which is as follows.</P>
<P>N. B. In describing the following process, I will, (to avoid interrupting remarks), sup|pose the weather to be regularly good, and the sand to dry once every day, and will here|after observe on contingent circumstances.</P>
<P>The first thing in the morning, the man at|taches the horse to the harrow in vat No. 1; then lets into the vat from the reservoir (E) one inch more water than on the preceding days, so that when every vat has been worked there may be one inch of water remaining in the last. The vat No. 1 being thus supplied with water, the man drives the horse up and down the vat, raking and stirring up the sand and water together, that the water may dissolve the salt left with the sand from the preceding dryings: this being accom|plished, the man removes the harrow to the se|cond vat, and draws off into that the water so strengthened with salt; here, the water, dimi|nished in quantity but increased in strength, re|ceives an additional supply of salt, by dissolving what it finds in the second vat: it is then let into the third vat, and so on, the same process
<PB N="29" REF="033729_0022_0FF929903954F0E0">
continued in each, till the water having increas|ed in strength in proportion as it diminished in quantity, what remains unabsorbed by the sand after having been admitted into the tenth vat, will have become perfectly saturated with salt, or what is commonly called brine. It is then let off into the covered reservoir (H) where having remained some time for the impurities to subside, it is drawn off into the crystallizing canal, and in the course of an hour or two the salt begins to crystallize.</P>
<P>During the intervals of leisure from the vats, the man and horse are employed in raising water for the supply of the reservoirs.</P>
<P>If the salt is wanted fine, it is taken from the crystallizing canal the first evening after crystalli|zation, and conveyed to the warehouse: if wanted coarse, the canal must be covered at night and the salt suffered to crystallize uninterruptedly for several days.</P>
<P>The above described process is continued re|gularly every fine day, and by it a regular quan|tity of salt is obtained according to the size of the vats every day during fine weather.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="033729_0023_0FF929952DA2A1E8">
One industrious man properly instructed in the management of the business, with one good horse may with ease do all the work necessary for machinery that will yield one hundred bushels of salt to the store per day on the average through|out the year. This remark will be more fully illustrated, and proved, by the following obser|vations on the most effectual mode of regulating the work.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS</HEAD>
<HEAD>On the most effectual mode of regulating the Work; of profiting by the casual advantages of fine weather, and lessening the casual disadvantages of bad wea|ther.</HEAD>
<P>It is readily admitted that the process of con|ducting works on the foregoing plan, is subject to very great irregularities from the vicissitudes to which the climate is liable; it is also admitted that the management of them should be intrust|ed only to a person perfectly acquainted with those branches of natural philosophy implicated by such an establishment; a person, capable of calculating, of reasoning, and forming an accurate judgment of those causes and events, which may co-operate with, or militate against the end con|templated.</P>
<P>A complete knowledge of the subject, can alone form the basis of a sound conduct; that complete knowledge, involves information of so various a nature, that the discussion thereof would induce a dissertation too diffuse for the purpose designed here. I shall, therefore, content myself
<PB N="32" REF="033729_0025_0FF929AA58ED31F0">
with observing on the principal circumstances to be attended to, without entering into an elaborate lecture on those branches of science requisite to turn such circumstances to the greatest advan|tage; supposing in every one concerned that in|telligence necessary for the adoption of measures advised.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE POND</HEAD>
<P>Offers itself as the first object of consideration.</P>
<P>The general intention of this pond involves two purposes.</P>
<P N="1">1st, That of having a quantity of good water always at hand for the supply of the works.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, That of profiting by every opportunity afforded by a continuance of fine weather, of suf|fering the water to strengthen therein as much as possible.</P>
<P>Any persons accustomed to make observations on the winds and weather, may judge pretty ac|curately at any time, of the kind of weather about to prevail for a few days to come. The tides at different places are heightened by different winds;
<PB N="33" REF="033729_0026_0FF929B4277E7170">
and the higher the tides in places contiguous to the sea, the stronger the water. By such calcula|tions the quantity of water to be admitted into the pond, and the times of admission are to be regulated.</P>
<P>For instance, (and in mentioning this instance, I will suppose the situation of all others the most difficult to judge in.) Imagine the works to be erected on an inlet, bay, or river, where the <HI>Easterly</HI> wind produces the highest tides. It would in that case be imprudent to admit water to the pond during the prevalence of a <HI>South</HI> or <HI>North Wester;</HI> unless water was immediately wanted, under all disadvantages, which care should be taken to prevent.</P>
<P>Again&mdash;easterly winds in this country, are ge|nerally attended with rain, and are of several days continuance. It would, therefore, be lost labour to introduce the water on the <HI>first</HI> high tide pro|duced by such winds, when the water would pro|bably be weakened by the succeeding rains. The best time, in such cases, of introducing the water would be on the first prospect of a change; easter|ly winds being generally succeeded by a north or south wester.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="033729_0027_0FF929BA9A0BEC48">
Suppose then, the water to be introduced at such a time; the quantity thereof must be deter|mined,</P>
<P N="1">1st, By the deficiency of water in the reservoirs.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, By the probability of the continuance of fine weather.</P>
<P>If the reservoirs are nearly empty, (which is not likely after a series of bad weather, though they may have become so in consequence of in|termitting rains having prevented a supply from the pond,) and there is to be expected a conti|nuance of fine weather, a larger quantity must be admitted; although even this must be regulated by the consideration of the approaching spring or neap tides.</P>
<P>After the water is admitted, the depth of which in the pond should not in general exceed six inches; it should be suffered to remain there till the next appearance of rain, (unless a portion of it be wanted for the immediate supply of the works) when, if the weather has continued fine for some days, it will have been considerably strengthened.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="033729_0028_0FF8C64D0165DD48">
It will readily occur that after a succession of fine weather, the contents of the reservoirs will be considerably lessened; of course, on the appa|rent approach of rain, <HI>after</HI> such a season, they will be capable of receiving a great supply. This is, therefore, the important time to secure in the lower reservoir as much of the strengthened wa|ter from the pond as possible. These occasions should be carefully watched; and, the power of the lower pump being calculated, proper time should be allowed for filling the lower reservoir before the rain comes on.</P>
<P>The average quantity of salt contained in sea water is one bushel in thirty.</P>
<P>Though the natural evaporation in this country is only about fifty six inches in the year; yet the evaporation during a week of fine weather will frequently exceed three inches.</P>
<P>Suppose then water which originally contained one bushel of salt in thirty, to have been admit|ted into the pond to the depth of six inches, and three inches thereof to have been evaporated du|ring a fine week; <HI>fifteen</HI> bushels of the remaining quantity of water will yield one bushel of salt. A
<PB N="36" REF="033729_0029_0FF929C098B48A08">
circumstance<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="obscured" EXTENT="1 letter"> like this will double the produce of the vats, without increasing the expense of working them.</P>
<P>These are advantages which it must be con|fessed do not occur frequently in this country; but when they <HI>do</HI> occur they are great, and if properly attended to, will considerably contri|bute to the success of such undertakings.</P>
<P>A series of fine weather for three or four weeks, may reasonably be expected three or four times every year. It is proper always to be prepared for such occasions, and when they <HI>do</HI> happen they will amply repay the trouble of preparing for them.</P>
<P>This pond has a sluice by which it empties itself into the river at low water, after rain or when oc|casion requires.</P>
<P>In winter, this pond will be still more advan|tageous, and to it a more regular attention is then necessary than in summer.</P>
<P>In the beginning of winter a severe frost fre|quently operates during the night, and a propor|tionable thaw during the day.</P>
<P>When such weather is expected, the use made of the pond should be this,</P>

Only a small depth of water should be admitted, proceeding accordingly to the supposed strength of the succeeding frost, from two or three inches, upwards.

<P>Attention to the admission of water at high tides, is not so necessary in winter as in summer; as the frost operates with greater force on the weaker water; therefore,</P>
<P>On the approach of a severe frost, it would be (generally considered) adviseable to let into the pond as much water as it will contain, which should not exceed two feet in depth, and remove the water from under the accumulating ice, only as it may be immediately wanted; as it will be|come stronger and stronger every day during the continuance of the frost.&mdash;Upon the commence|ment of the breaking up of the frost, all diligence must be applied to the securing of the strengthen|ed water in the lower reservoir, which will serve for use during the succeeding thaw while the ice is dissolving in the pond and retiring through the sluice into the river.</P>
<P>If the frost should at any time be so severe, as to leave only a small quantity of water uncongeal|ed, more must be admitted from the river, and a large hole made in the ice near the admitting sluice to suffer the fresh supply to run under it.</P>

It would greatly facilitate the security of any quantity of water strengthened by the pond in summer or winter, to have an additional reser|voir, (if circumstances would admit of it) sunk below the level of the bottom of the pond, so that on the approach of rain in summer, or thaw in winter, the strengthened water might, by a capa|cious sluice, be at once let into it. This indeed would be necessary where extensive works re|quired a large pond, as it would be difficult or at least expensive, to raise a very great body of water between the appearance of approaching rain, and its arrival, whereas, by introducing this last mentioned reservoir of sufficient capacity, the whole might be at once secured in a few minutes; nor would the raising the water therefrom, produce an additional expense to the <HI>yearly</HI> establishment, as the man and horse, or men and horses, might be employed during wet weather, (when they could do nothing at the vats), in filling the other reservoirs therefrom.</P>

<HEAD>THE RESERVOIRS.</HEAD>
<P>Respecting the Reservoirs few observations are necessary. The principal care requisite is to keep them properly supplied. Some evaporation may be expected from them, and in winter con|siderable additional advantages may be derived

from them by frost&mdash;by removing the ice formed on the surface of the water. These reservoirs being constantly covered, nothing need be ob|served on them respecting rain, from which the water contained in them is secured.</P>
<P>We now come to the vats, the principal object in the works.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE VATS.</HEAD>
<P>I have before mentioned that sand is used as the principal instrument of evaporation, and given the reasons therefor. I shall now consider its effects.</P>
<P>Water when imbibed by sand, and the sand so moistened spread regularly over a level plane and occasionally raked, will evaporate at least four times as fast as it will in a fluid state exposed to the same sun and air.</P>
<P>Sand will absorb and retain about one third of its bulk of water, and will, on the average, if pro|perly attended to, evaporate the same in four and twenty hours.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="033729_0035_0FF929E0DDFE2190">
Suppose then ten vats, of sufficient capacity to contain each, when spread regularly over its bottom, 300 bushels of sand.</P>
<P>Suppose each of these vats to absorb, and evaporate daily 100 bushels of water. Suppose each 100 bushels of water to contain 4 bushels of salt.</P>
<P>After six successive wettings and dryings the sand in each vat will contain 24 bushels of salt.</P>
<P>On the seventh day, let into vat No. 1, 1,100 bushels of salt water, containing at 4 bushels per hundred, 44 bushels of salt.

<P>It is unnecessary to pursue these calculations further; what has been done is sufficient to show the progress of saturation, and the manner in which the end contemplated is effected.</P>
<P>The process is regularly continued during fine weather, and every time the sand dries, the fame quantity of brine may be procured, and the vats will be left more and more impregnated with salt.</P>
<P>The principle advantages arising from leaving the vats strongly impregnated with salt are the following.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="033729_0041_0FF92A073B53A710">
It will sometimes happen that the sand may not be sufficiently dry, when it will be necessary on many accounts to wash the vats; less water will of course in that case be retained by the sand in each vat, and of course the greater quantity re|main in the tenth&mdash;if, therefore, there was only salt enough left with the sand to saturate <HI>one</HI> hun|dred bushels of water, 150, or 200 bushels being left to be drawn off into the reservoir, would be unfit for immediate use, and <HI>if</HI> drawn off into the reservoir would weaken the brine before contained therein, and thereby probably put a stop to the regular process of crystallization.</P>
<P>Again, on the approach of rain, the vats should always be washed, that the sand may be left fully saturated with salt water, and with a smooth sur|face; that the rain, when it falls, may remain on the surface unmixed with the sand or salt wa|ter; and on the return of fine weather quietly be drawn off through a hole in the bottom of each vat. Now, the sand being left strongly impreg|nated with salt, will always afford sufficient to sa|turate the extraordinary quantity of water used for this purpose, which, however should never be more than necessary to pass through all the vats and leave the sand a smooth, wet and compact mass; which being done, the rain will fall on the
<PB N="49" REF="033729_0042_0FF9291AD7397EE0">
sand without doing any material injury, and may be let off from each vat on the return of fine wea|ther as fresh, or very nearly so, as it fell.</P>
<P>It would be generally prudent, during the sum|mer, to wash the sand in the evening, when the weather is calm or doubtful, leaving the raking of it till the morning.</P>
<P>This answers two purposes, it leaves the sand prepared against accidental rains during the night, and the vats are the sooner ready in the morning for evaporation.</P>
<P>But, when the night is expected to be fine and evaporating, the raking should not be postponed unless the washing is postponed also.</P>
<P>During dry windy weather, and particularly when it happens during the night, when the ma|chines cannot so easily be watched, the sand should not be suffered to dry as in calm hot weather, but should be kept regularly moistened: this may be done by permitting a stream of water proportionate to the evaporation to run constant|ly from the reservoir, draining from the first vat into the second, and so on: this not only prevents
<PB N="50" REF="033729_0043_0FF92A1150A93688">
the sand from being blown away, but forwards evaporation very considerably.</P>
<P>Care must in general be taken to lose no ad|vantages of fine weather, by doing that kind of work in the middle of the day, such as wetting the sand &amp;c. during the most powerful evapora|tion, which may as well be done in the morn|ing or evening when the evaporation is less.</P>
<P>In spite, however, of the greatest care and at|tention, accidental circumstances may sometimes bring into the tenth vat, a quantity of water not fully saturated; this should by no means be ad|mitted to the reservoir (H) To provide against difficulties of this nature it would be proper to have a spout running under the vats to convey the water on such occasions back to the lower reservoir (C). This would be attended with no other disadvantage, but that of raising such a quantity of water a second time to the upper re|servoir (E).</P>
<P>It is to be observed, that all the foregoing cal|culations have been made on a supposition, that the water issues from the upper reservoir (E) containing four bushels of salt in one hundred of water, or one bushel in twenty five. The pond
<PB N="51" REF="033729_0044_0FF92A197A7DC910">
and lower reservoir being well attended to, it will never contain less, but frequently and generally more.</P>
<P>For instance. Suppose 6 inches of water to have been admitted into the pond, and during a series of fine weather <HI>three</HI> inches thereof to have been evaporated; if the water originally contain|ed one bushel of salt in <HI>thirty,</HI> it will then contain one bushel in <HI>fifteen.</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>two</HI> inches only should have been evapora|ted, it will contain one in <HI>twenty,</HI> and so on.</P>
<P>Water, so strengthened, being secured in the lower reservoir, will considerably increase the profits of the works; and as attention to the pond is attended with very little difficulty, and no expense, (circumspection being the principal requisite while the water is strengthening, and care to secure a sufficient quantity when strength|ened,) it must be owing to bad management alone, if the water, by the time it arrives in the upper reservoir, does not contain more than one bushel in twenty five on the average throughout the year.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="033729_0045_0FF92A1FD9DFEAA8">
The vats in winter are in general more pro|fitable in producing brine than in summer, but require a different process. The business then is this.</P>
<P>In the beginning of winter, on the evening pre|ceding an expected frost, after having washed the sand, and extracted all the salt possible; a quan|tity of water must be let into each vat, propor|tionate to the expected density of the frost, and there suffered to remain all night; in the morn|ing, before it begins to thaw, the strengthened water must be drawn off and returned by the spout under the vats to the lower reservoir: as it begins to thaw, the cocks leading from one vat to the other must be stopped, and the plug in the bottom of each vat opened, to let off the condensed part as it becomes fluid. All being gone the plug must be stopped if the weather is fine, the sand raked and exposed to evaporation.</P>
<P>But, as the winter advances, this daily trouble will not be requisite; for, when it ceases to thaw during the day, the water may be continued in the vats, and exposed to the frost till it is nearly saturated; when it must be drawn off; and if the frost continues, the ice removed, and a fresh quantity of water exposed for condensation; or
<PB N="53" REF="033729_0046_0FF8C65FCAE88E88">
if a thaw attended with rain is expected, the trou|ble of removing the ice may be avoided by open|ing the plug, and letting it run out as dissolved.</P>
<P>Calculation at the time of operation must de|termine the propriety of adopting either of these expedients; I shall only add that by a careful attendance to the pond, reservoirs, and vats, du|ring the winter, an immense quantity of strong salt water may be secured ready for the operation of spring, and which will treble the produce of the sand, when by the retiring of the frost it is at liberty to operate.</P>
<P>With respect to the reservoir for the brine, little is necessary to be observed. No brine should be received in it till perfectly saturated, nor with|drawn from it, till perfectly settled and clear.</P>
<P>The crystallizing canal (or canals,) should be about a foot deep, with sliding covers, which may with ease be drawn off or on as the weather re|quires. These covers should consist of light pine frames with painted canvas tightly stretched over them. The brine, when let into this canal will begin to crystallize in a few hours, in small white cubes, which will increase in size so long as they are suffered to remain undisturbed.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="033729_0047_0FF92A25AEB96148">
When the salt is to be taken out, baskets should be placed, (at regular distances), so as to drain into the canal: the man then goes into the canal and shovels the salt into these baskets, where having remained about half an hour, it becomes sufficiently dry for storing; the man then attach|es the horse to the cart, and driving along the side of the canal fills the cart with the salt, and takes it to the warehouse; having taken out as much as necessary, he slides on the covers, and leaves it till the morning, when, if the remaining fluid contains no more <HI>marine</HI> salt, it is let off, unless wanted for the purpose of making Epsom or Glauber salts, which with very little trouble it would produce in abundance.</P>
<P>I have now entered into a complete description of every part of the works, and the method of managing them; from which it must appear that after such machinery is erected, the business may be carried on at a very small expense. I have al|ready ventured to observe that one man and one horse could, without any other expence, from works sufficiently capacious, make one hundred bushels per day on the average throughout the year; and I believe it to be the fact.</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to make minute calculations on the expense of erecting such works, as the
<PB N="55" REF="033729_0048_0FF92A2B8DCDDBF8">
prices of timber, boards, labour, &amp;c. vary ac|cording to situation. Works, in any situation, where the above articles were easily procurable, which would produce 100 bushels of salt per day on the average throughout the year or 36,500 bushels per year might, I am sure, be erected for less than 15,000 dollars; and smaller or larger works in proportion.</P>

<HEAD>Miscellaneous Observations.</HEAD>
<P>MUCH expence may be saved in the erection of these works, by chusing a convenient spot for the purpose; and much may be added to the pro|duce, by adopting a situation, where the soil and air are generally dry, and not subject to fogs, mists or damp exhalations.</P>
<P>There are many situations on the banks of salt water rivers, formerly the habitation of Indians, where the upper stratum of the soil consists chief|ly of oyster and other fish shells; such a situation, if suitable in other respects, would be peculi|arly advantageous, not only from its natural warmth, but from its porosity suffering the rains as they fall to sink beyond the reach of evaporation, and leaving the surface dry, thereby preventing that saturation, or rather that approach to saturation of the air, which in calm hot weather generally succeeds heavy rains, in situations where the soil being less porous suffers the water to stagnate on its surface.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="033729_0050_0FF92A3736D03230">
Air is always in search of water, and where the soil, powerfully acted upon by the sun, yields it freely, will soon saturate itself&punc; hence that vibratory motion in the air often visible in calm hot weather, when the heated soil exhales more moisture than the stagnating air will immediately dissolve.</P>
<P>Air, though in a dead calm it may be said to have no positive motion, has yet a relative one, that is, though in a large body it may not be moving from one place to another, yet is there constantly a circulating motion of its particles within itself; like the circulation of the blood through the body of an animal though the animal itself be at rest.</P>
<P>Now suppose a large body of air <HI>positively</HI> sta|tionary over a tract of ground remaining a long time wet after heavy rains, (on which such works are erected) and yielding freely its moisture to the air; does it not necessarily follow that that air fed equally from every part of the land, must be soon saturated with water, and remain a dead, though perhaps invisible mist, having no evapo|rating power, till the whole body be driven away by a succeeding current?</P>
<P>Suppose, on the other hand, a similar body of
<PB N="58" REF="033729_0051_0FF92A41D8836018">
air to remain stationary, over a <HI>dry</HI> tract of ground, on which such works are erected, yielding only scanty exhalations; will it not naturally occur that the air will seek for food where only it can be supplied, and attacking the vats for moisture, which sand naturally repels, feed itself from them? A number of particles being fed, relative motion immediately succeeds, from two causes; increased gravity of the particles, and the changing angles of refraction of the solar rays; partial motion being obtained, a general (relative) motion will soon take place; for, the solution of water in air is similar to the solution of salt in water; im|pregnate a part, and that impregnation will soon be dispersed throughout the whole. If this hy|pothesis be just, the advantages to be derived from fixing the works on a dry soil must be very great, by forcing a large body of air in calm weather to feed itself from the moisture of the vats, when it would otherwise be saturated by the surrounding exhalations.</P>
<P>There are some places where natural ponds are formed near the water, which with a little ex|pense, may be adapted to the purpose desired in these works.</P>
<P>By chusing a situation for the vats where the
<PB N="59" REF="033729_0052_0FF8C6642B521680">
ground has a declivity of 18 or 20 feet, the ex|pense of raising the reservoir and vats may be avoided.</P>
<P>It is not <HI>very</HI> essential to have them close toge|ther; of course, the more compact works of this nature are, the better; but, if the ground would not afford a sufficient descent for the vats if close together, they may be placed at the distance ne|cessary for that advantage, and communicate with each other by means of a spout. Some little in|conveniences may occur from an adoption of this plan, but they may be easily obviated or counter|balanced by a judicious manager.</P>
<P>The bottoms of the water reservoirs, vats, and crystallizing canal, may be of pine boards, if good: The lining of the reservoir for the brine, should be made entirely of two or three inch plank well caulked and pitched: the bottom of the crystal|lizing canal should be pitched all over: this will accelerate the crystallization, and prevent the brine from soaking through the bottom.</P>
<P>The sides of the vats and crystallizing canal should be made of one plank in depth cut feather edged, the lower edge being about four inches thick, the upper, one.</P>

If the vats are built in the shape of a rectangu|lar paralellogram; care should be taken to place the sides towards the south, letting the vats ex|tend east and west; otherwise, a great part of them will be shaded from the morning and even|ing sun.</P>
<P>In planning the vats, it appears best to have them long and narrow, that the boards may be laid crossways; the breadth of the vats being de|termined by the length of the boards, to prevent waste and buttings: by having them in this man|ner, the boards when jointed may be wedged up very tight, and no caulking will be necessary. Besides, if the vats are worked by a horse, this plan obviates three great disadvantages which would otherwise occur; frequent turnings, walk|ing constantly on one board, and treading be|tween the joice.</P>
<P>I shall now dismiss the subject with a firm hope and belief that some time or other I shall have it in my power to say, "my labour has not been in vain."</P>
