<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>A Simplicity in diet, whether it be con|&s;idered with reference to the happine&s;s of individuals or the pro&s;perity of a nation, is of more con&s;equence than we are apt to imagine. In recomending &s;o important an object to the rational part of mankind, I wi&s;h it were in my power to do it in &s;uch a man|ner as would be likely to gain their attention. I am &s;en&s;ible that it is one of tho&s;e &s;ubjects in which example has infinitely more power than the mo&s;t convincing arguments or the highe&s;t charms of poetry. Gold&s;mith's DE|SERTED VILLAGE, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the&s;e two advantages in a greater degree than any other work of the kind, has not prevented villages in England from being de&s;erted. The apparent intere&s;t of the rich individuals, who
<PB REF="030023_0003_0FE3C6A8F9DC1E58">
form the ta&s;te as well as the laws in that coun|try, has been again&s;t him; and with that in|tere&s;t it has been vain to contend.</P>
<P>The vicious habits which in this little piece I endeavour to combat, &s;eem to me not &s;o dif|ficult to cure. No cla&s;s of people has any in|tere&s;t in &s;upporting them; unle&s;s it be the intere&s;t which certain families may feel in vying with each other in &s;umptuous enter|tainments. There may indeed be &s;ome in|&s;tances of depraved appetites, which no argu|ments will conquer; but the&s;e mu&s;t be rare. There are very few per&s;ons but what would always prefer a plain di&s;h for them&s;elves, and would prefer it likewi&s;e for their gue&s;ts, if there were no ri&s;k of reputation in the ca&s;e. This difficulty can only be removed by exam|ple; and the example &s;hould proceed from tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ituation enables them to take the lead in forming the manners of a nation. Per&s;ons of this de&s;cription in America, I &s;hould hope, are neither above nor below
<PB N="v" REF="030023_0004_0FE3C6AE447B2010">
the influence of truth and rea&s;on, when con|veyed in language &s;uited to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Whether the manner I have cho&s;en to ad|dre&s;s my argments to them be &s;uch as to pro|mi&s;e any &s;ucce&s;s is what I cannot decide&punc; but I certainly had hopes of doing &s;ome good, or I &s;hould not have taken the pains of putting &s;o many rhymes together&mdash;The example of dome&s;tic virtues has doubtle&s;s a great effect. I only wi&s;h to rank SIMPLICITY of DIET a|mong the virtues. In that ca&s;e I &s;hould hope it will be cheri&s;hed and more e&s;teemed by o|thers than it is at pre&s;ent.</P>

<L>THE days grow &s;hort; but tho' the fallen &s;un</L>
<L>To the glad &s;wain proclaims his day's work done,</L>
<L>Night's plea&s;ant &s;hades his various ta&s;ks prolong,</L>
<L>And yield new &s;ubjects to my various &s;ong.</L>
<L>For now, the corn-hou&s;e fill'd the harve&s;t home,</L>
<L>Th' invited neighbours to the hu&s;king come;</L>
<L>A frolic &s;cene, where work, and mirth, and play,</L>
<L>Unite their charms, to chace the hours away.</L>
<L>Where the huge heap lies centre'd in the hall,</L>
<L>The lamp &s;u&s;pended from the chearful wall,</L>
<L>Brown corn-fed nymphs, and &s;trong hard-handed beax,</L>
<L>Alternate rang'd, extend in circling rows,</L>
<L>A&s;&s;ume their &s;eats, the &s;olid ma&s;s attack;</L>
<L>The dry hu&s;ks ru&s;tle, and the corn-cobs crack;</L>
<L>The &s;ong, the laugh, alternate notes re&s;ound,</L>
<L>And the &s;weet cider trips in &s;ilence round.</L>
<L>The laws of Hu&s;king ev'ry wight can tell;</L>
<L>And &s;ure no laws he ever keeps &s;o well:</L>
<L>For each red ear a general ki&s;s he gains,</L>
<L>With each &s;mut ear he &s;muts the luckle&s;s &s;wains,</L>
<L>But when to &s;ome &s;weet maid a prize is ca&s;t,</L>
<L>Red as her lips, and taper as her wai&s;t,</L>
<L>She walks the round, and culls one favor'd bea</L>
<L>Who leaps, the lu&s;cious tribute to be&s;tow.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="030023_0018_0FE3C6EC4B90E830">Various the &s;ports, as are the wits and brains</L>
<L>Of well-plea&s;'d la&s;&s;es and contending &s;wains;</L>
<L>Till the va&s;t mound of corn is &s;wept away,</L>
<L>And he that gets the la&s;t ear, wins the day.</L>
<L>Mean-while the hou&s;e-wife urges all her care,</L>
<L>The well-earn'd fea&s;t to ha&s;ten and prepare.</L>
<L>The &s;ifted meal already wait, her hand,</L>
<L>The milk is &s;train'd, the bowls in order &s;tand,</L>
<L>The fire flames high; and, as a pool (that takes</L>
<L>The headlong &s;tream that o'er the mill-dam breaks)</L>
<L>Foams, roars and rages with ince&s;&s;ant toils,</L>
<L>So the vext cauldren rages, roars and boils.</L>
<L>Fir&s;t with clean &s;alt &s;he &s;ea&s;ons well the food,</L>
<L>Then &s;trews the flour, and thickens all the flood.</L>
<L>Long o'er the &s;immering fire &s;he lets it &s;tand;</L>
<L>To &s;tir it well demands a &s;tronger hand?</L>
<L>The hu&s;band takes his turn; and round and round</L>
<L>The ladle flies; at la&s;t the toil is crown'd;</L>
<L>When to the board the thronging hu&s;kers pour,</L>
<L>And take their &s;eats as at the corn before.</L>
<L>I leave them to their fea&s;t. There &s;till belong</L>
<L>More copious matters to my faithful &s;ong.</L>
<L>For rules there are, tho' ne'er unfolded yet,</L>
<L>Nice rules and wi&s;e, how pudding &s;hould be ate.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="030023_0019_0FE3C6EF1029B5E8">Some with mola&s;&s;es line the lu&s;cious treat,</L>
<L>And mix, like Bards, the u&s;eful with the &s;weet.</L>
<L>A whole&s;ome di&s;h, and well de&s;erving prai&s;e,</L>
<L>A great re&s;ource in tho&s;e bleak wint'ry days,</L>
<L>When the chill'd earth lies buried deep in &s;now,</L>
<L>And raging Boreas dries the &s;hivering cow.</L>
<L>Ble&s;t cow! thy prai&s;e &s;hall &s;till my notes employ,</L>
<L>Great &s;ource of health, the only &s;ource of joy;</L>
<L>Mother of Egypt's God,&mdash;but &s;ure, for me,</L>
<L>Were I to leave my God, I'd wor&s;hip thee.</L>
<L>How oft thy teats the&s;e pious hands have pre&s;t!</L>
<L>How oft thy bounties prove'd my only fea&s;t!</L>
<L>How oft I've fed thee with my fav'rite grain!</L>
<L>And roar'd like thee, to find thy children &s;lain!</L>
<L>Ye &s;wains who know her various worth to prize,</L>
<L>Ah! hou&s;e her well from Winter's angry &s;kies.</L>
<L>Potatoes, pumpkins, &s;hould her &s;adne&s;s cheer,</L>
<L>Corn from your crib, and ma&s;hes from your beer;</L>
<L>When Spring returns &s;he'll well acquit the loan,</L>
<L>And nur&s;e at once your infants and her own.</L>
<L>Milk then with pudding I &s;hould always chu&s;e</L>
<L>To this in future I confine my Mu&s;e,</L>
<L>Till &s;he in ha&s;te &s;ome farther hints unfold,</L>
<L>Well for the young, nor u&s;ele&s;s to the old.</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="030023_0020_0FE3C6F45886EE40">Fir&s;t in your bowl the milk abundant take,</L>
<L>Then drop with care along the &s;ilver lake</L>
<L>Your flakes of pudding; the&s;e at fir&s;t will hide</L>
<L>Their little bulk beneath the &s;welling tide;</L>
<L>But when their growing ma&s;s no more can &s;ink,</L>
<L>When the &s;oft i&s;land looms above the brink,</L>
<L>Then check your hand; you've got the portion due,</L>
<L>So taught our &s;ires, and what they taught is true.</L>
<L>There is a choice in &s;poons. Tho' &s;mall appear</L>
<L>The nice di&s;tinction, yet to me 'tis clear.</L>
<L>The deep bowl'd Gallic &s;poon contriv'd to &s;coop</L>
<L>In ample draughts the thin diluted &s;oup,</L>
<L>Performs not well in tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial things,</L>
<L>Who&s;e ma&s;s adhe&s;ive to the metal clings;</L>
<L>Where the &s;trong labial mu&s;cles mu&s;t embrace.</L>
<L>The gentle curve, and &s;weep the hollow &s;pace</L>
<L>With ea&s;e to enter and di&s;charge the freight,</L>
<L>A bowl le&s;s concave but &s;till more dilate,</L>
<L>Becomes the pudding be&s;t. The &s;hape, the &s;ize,</L>
<L>A &s;ecret re&s;t unknown to vulgar eyes.</L>
<L>Experienc'd feeders can alone impart</L>
<L>A rule &s;o much above the lore of art.</L>
<L>The&s;e tuneful lips, that thou&s;and &s;poons have tried,</L>
<L>With ju&s;t preci&s;ion could the point decide,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="030023_0021_0FE3C6F8EA1E6CC8">Tho' not in &s;ong; the mu&s;e but poorly &s;hines</L>
<L>In cones, and cubes, and geometric lines.</L>
<L>Yet the true form, as near as &s;he can tell,</L>
<L>Is that &s;mall &s;ection of a goo&s;e-egg-&s;hell,</L>
<L>Which in two equal portions &s;hall divide</L>
<L>The di&s;tance from the centre to the &s;ide.</L>
<L>Fear not to &s;laver; 'tis no deadly &s;in.</L>
<L>Like the free Frenchman, from your joyous chin</L>
<L>Su&s;pend the ready napkin, or, like me,</L>
<L>Poi&s;e with one hand your bowl upon your knee;</L>
<L>Ju&s;t in the zenith your wi&s;e head project,</L>
<L>Your full &s;poon, ri&s;ing in a line direct,</L>
<L>Bold as a bucket, heeds no drops that fall,</L>
<L>The wide mouth'd bowl will &s;urely catch them all.</L>
