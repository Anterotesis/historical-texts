<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE, CHARACTER, AND WRITINGS OF DR. <HI>ISAAC WATTS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE life of Dr. WATTS is more in&s;tructive from the brightne&s;s of his example than enter|taining from any variety of incidents. This de|fect is partly owing to the nature of his employ|ment; partly to a long continued infirmity of body, which obliged him to live retired from the world, and partly to a re&s;olution which he had taken not to leave behind him any memorials from which a narrative of his life might be com|piled. It was his choice that his character might
<PB N="6" REF="025154_0004_0FCE726B37230550">
appear from his <HI>printed</HI> works, and not from any private papers. His friends, to whom he com|mitted the care of publi&s;hing his books, were ex|pre&s;sly prohibited from making a collection of his letters, which might ea&s;ily have been done &s;oon after his death.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The propriety of this prohibition is evidenced by a collection of his <HI>letters</HI> publi&s;hed in 1779, with other po&s;thumous works; which, in the opinion of the Monthly Reviewers, "ought rather to have been committed to the flames than &s;ent to the pre&s;s."</P>
<P>Many of them related to a controver&s;y between him and Mr. THOMAS BRADBURY, a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter in London. Bradbury was a man of wit and &s;pleen. In his merry moments he would laugh at &s;ome of Watts's hymns; and in his &s;plenetic and zealous hours would abu&s;e his principles and call in que&s;tion his orthodoxy. Watts acknowledged the &s;prightline&s;s of his antagoni&s;t, but thought his wit vain and licentious, and called in que&s;tion his veracity It was a mere per&s;onal quarrel of no con&s;equence to the public.</P>
<BIBL>Mon. Review, 1779. p. 431.</BIBL></NOTE> The materials from which any account of his life can be compo&s;ed are there|fore few; they exhibit a vigorous mind in a weak body; a character amiable and worthy of imita|tion.</P>
<P>He was born at Southampton on the 17th of July, 1674, and was the elde&s;t of nine children. His father ISAAC WATTS, was a man of con|&s;iderable learning, and was keeper of a boarding &s;chool. His parents were eminent for religion, and were &s;ufferers for con&s;cience &s;ake in the per|&s;ecution rai&s;ed again&s;t the nonconformi&s;ts by CHARLES II.</P>
<P>The uncommon genius of their &s;on appeared early. He began to learn Latin at four years old; and made a &s;wift progre&s;s in that and the Greek language, under the care of Mr. PIN|HORNE, a clergyman of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and ma&s;ter of the free &s;chool at Southampton, to whom the gratitude of his &s;cholar afterward in|&s;cribed
<PB N="7" REF="025154_0005_0FCE723CCF7CF358">
a Latin ode. It was written at the age of twenty, and is in&s;erted among his Lyric Po|ems.</P>
<P>He was &s;oon taken notice of for the &s;pright|line&s;s of his wit, as well as for his proficiency in his &s;tudies, and a &s;ub&s;cription was propo&s;ed for his education at one of the univer&s;ities. But his inclination to take his lot with the di&s;&s;enters made him decline this offer; and in the year 1690, at the age of &s;ixteen, he was &s;ent to Lon|don for academical education, under the care of the Rev. THOMAS ROWE, to whom al&s;o, he has in&s;cribed an ode among his Lyric ver&s;es. Some Latin e&s;&s;ays, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been written as ex|erci&s;es at this academy, &s;how a degree of know|ledge both philo&s;ophical and theological, to which very few per&s;ons attain by a much longer cour&s;e of &s;tudy.</P>
<P>He was, as he hints in his mi&s;cellanies, a maker of ver&s;es from the age of fifteen to fifty, and in his youth he gave attention to Latin po|etry. His ver&s;es to his brother in the <HI>glyconic</HI> mea&s;ure, written at &s;eventeen, are remarkably ea&s;y and elegant. Some of his other odes are deformed by the <HI>Pindaric</HI> folly then prevailing, and are written with &s;uch negligence of all me|trical rules as is without example among the an|cients; but his diction, though not always ex|actly pure, has &s;uch copiou&s;ne&s;s and &s;plendor as &s;hows that he was not far from excellence.</P>
<P>His method of &s;tudy was &s;ometimes to impre&s;s the contents of books upon his memory by abridging them; at other times to write remarks in the margin and blank leaves; to &s;tate his ob|jections
<PB N="8" REF="025154_0006_0FCE726F9C86C7B8">
to what he thought exceptionable; to illu&s;trate and confirm what appeared ju&s;t, and to in&s;ert his opinion of the whole performance. This method he has recommended to &s;tudents in his book of the Improvement of the Mind.</P>
<P>Having an early impre&s;&s;ion of the truth and importance of religion on his mind, he was guarded again&s;t the follies of youth; his conduct whil&s;t at the academy, was not only &s;o inoffen|&s;ive that his tutor declared he never once had oc|ca&s;ion to reprove him; but it was &s;o exemplary as to be frequently propo&s;ed to the other &s;tudents for their imitation. Among the&s;e were JOHN HUGHES, the poet, Dr. JOSIAH HORT, after|wards archbi&s;hop of Tuam in Ireland, to whom one of his Lyric pieces is in&s;cribed, and SAMUEL SAY, a di&s;&s;enting clergyman of We&s;tmin&s;ter, who&s;e poems were publi&s;hed by DUNCOMBE.</P>
<P>In his nineteenth year (1693) he joined in com|munion with the church, of which his tutor was the worthy pa&s;tor. The next year, having fin|i&s;hed his academical cour&s;e, he returned to his father's hou&s;e at Southampton; where he &s;pent two years more in &s;tudy and devotion, preparato|ry to his entering on the work of the go&s;pel min|i&s;try, to which he was determined to devote his life; and of the importance of which he had a deep &s;en&s;e on his mind. His father treated him with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s, and had the plea|&s;ure of living to &s;ee him eminent for literature, and venerable for piety and u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>In 1696 he was invited by the learned and pi|ous Sir JOHN HARTOPP to re&s;ide in his family as a tutor to his &s;on. Here he continued four
<PB N="9" REF="025154_0007_0FCE723E8A957900">
years, and his behaviour was &s;o engaging as to win the affections of the family, and lay a found|ation for that intimate friend&s;hip which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and his pupil to the day of his death. To this gentleman he dedicated two of his Lyric odes, in one of which he recommends <HI>early ri&s;ing,</HI> as a nece&s;&s;ary means of diligence and u&s;efulne&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>"Live my dear HARTOPP, live to day,</L>
<L>Nor let the &s;un look down and &s;ay</L>
<L>Inglorious here he lies;</L>
<L>Shake off your ea&s;e and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end your name</L>
<L>To immortality and fame</L>
<L>By <HI>ev'ry</HI> hour that flies."</L></NOTE></P>
<P>Whil&s;t he a&s;&s;i&s;ted the &s;tudies of his pupil he did not neglect his own; but be&s;ides tho&s;e branches of &s;cience in which he in&s;tructed him, he diligently &s;tudied the &s;criptures in the origin|al languages, and the be&s;t commentators ancient and modern.</P>
<P>He began to preach on the day which com|pleted the twenty-fourth year of his age (1698) and in the &s;ame year he was cho&s;en a&s;&s;i&s;tant to Dr. ISAAC CHAUNCY,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He was &s;on of CHARLES CHAUNCY, Pre&s;ident of Harvard College in New-England, where he received his education, and grandfather of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> church in Bo&s;ton.</NOTE> then pa&s;tor of the di&s;|&s;enting church in Berry&s;treet, London. His public labors met with general acceptance; but were &s;oon after interrupted by a threatening ill|ne&s;s of five months continuance, which was brought on him by his clo&s;e application to &s;tudy, and his fervor in preaching. This however did not di&s;courage him from returning to his work as &s;oon as his health was re&s;tored.</P>
<P>In January 1701, he received a Call from that church to &s;ucceed Dr. Chauncy in the pa&s;toral
<PB N="10" REF="025154_0008_0FCE7271E3C89560">
office, of which he &s;ignified his acceptance on the day that King WILLIAM died. This cir|cum&s;tance is particularly noted by Dr. JEN|NINGS as an act of chri&s;tian heroi&s;m, becau&s;e of the di&s;couraging pro&s;pect which that event gave to men of his profe&s;&s;ion, and the fears with which it filled the hearts of prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters at that time, when toleration was &s;o in&s;ecurely e&s;tabli&s;hed that the exi&s;tence of it depended on mere ca&s;ualty. But he had "&s;et his hand to the plough, and would not look back." Accord|ingly he was ordained on the 18th of March, 1702.</P>
<P>The joy of his church in their happy &s;ettle|ment was &s;oon clouded by a &s;econd &s;evere illne&s;s which laid him by for &s;ometime, and from which he recovered by &s;low degrees. This made it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for his church to provide an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and Mr SAMUEL PRICE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te Dr. RICHARD PRICE, of Hackn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y.</NOTE> was cho&s;en to that &s;ervice in July 1703.</P>
<P>Though relieved in part of his public labours, his health remained very fluctuating and uncer|tain for &s;everal years; but as it returned he re|newed his diligence in fulfilling his mini&s;try. His congregation was edified by his public di&s;|cour&s;es, and by his entertaining and profitable conver&s;ation in his private vi&s;its. This was a &s;ea&s;on of the be&s;t health which he ever enjoyed, and during this time he formed a private &s;oicety of the younger per&s;ons in his congregation, to which he delivered the &s;ub&s;tance of that excellent book which he afterward publi&s;hed under the title of "A Guide to Prayer."</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="025154_0009_0FCE723FAB1E6808">That the utmo&s;t harmony and affection &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between him and his congregation appears from his own words in the dedication of the fir&s;t volume of his &s;ermons to them. "I can pro|nounce it, with the greate&s;t &s;incerity, that there is no place, nor company, nor employment, on this &s;ide heaven, which can give me &s;uch a re|li&s;h of delight, as when I &s;tand mini&s;tring holy things in the mid&s;t of you." "Your forward kindne&s;s hath always forbidden my reque&s;ts, nor do I remember that you ever gave me leave to a&s;k any think for my&s;elf at your hands, by your con&s;tant anticipation of all that I could rea&s;ona|bly de&s;ire."</P>
<P>In the pulpit, though his low &s;tature, which very little exceeded five feet, gave him no advan|tage of appearance, yet the gravity and propriety of his utterance rendered his di&s;cour&s;es &s;olemn and affecting. Dr. JOHNSON has &s;aid that he once mentioned the reputation which "mode&s;t FOSTER" had gained by his proper delivery, to his friend HAWKESWORTH, who told him that in the art of pronunciation he was far inferior to Dr. WATTS. Mr. PALMER, in his notes on John&s;on, que&s;tions the ju&s;tice of this a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Such was his flow of thought, and &s;uch the promptitude of his language, that in his advan|ced &s;tage of life, he did not pre-compo&s;e his common &s;ermons; but having adju&s;ted the heads, and &s;ketched out &s;ome particulars, he tru&s;ted for the re&s;t to his extemporaneous pow|ers.</P>
<P>He did not endeavour to a&s;&s;i&s;t his eloquence by any ge&s;ticulations; for as no corporeal actions
<PB N="12" REF="025154_0010_0FCE7272AF92F098">
have any corre&s;pondence with theological truth, he did not &s;ee how it could be enforced by them.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of weighty &s;entences, both in preaching and prayer, he gave time, by a &s;hort pau&s;e, for the proper impre&s;&s;ion. His prayers were direct addre&s;&s;es to the Deity, not in florid expre&s;&s;ions or in long and involved &s;entences, but in ea&s;y language and &s;hort periods. They comprehended every proper &s;ubject, yet with &s;uch brevity and pertinency of expre&s;&s;ion, that, at the conclu&s;ion, it was difficult to conceive what more or le&s;s could have been &s;aid on each &s;ubject.</P>
<P>He often pre&s;&s;ed on his hearers the duties of &s;obriety, ju&s;tice, and charity; but the inward and &s;piritual parts of religion, and the &s;ecret com|munion between GOD and the &s;oul, took up a much larger &s;hare of his di&s;cour&s;es. He aimed to re&s;cue the&s;e exerci&s;es from the charge of en|thu&s;ia&s;m, and to place them in &s;uch a light as might &s;how their perfect con&s;i&s;tency with rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Though exempt in almo&s;t every &s;en&s;e of the term from mental infirmity, he was the contin|ual victim of bodily weakne&s;s; his be&s;t &s;chemes and mo&s;t favourite exerci&s;es being perpetually in|terrupted by it. In the month of September, 1712, he was &s;eized with a violent fever which &s;hook his con&s;titution exceedingly, and termina|ted in &s;uch a weakne&s;s of the nerves as made him &s;ubject to the hypochondria during the remainder of his life. The agitation of his &s;pirits during this &s;ickne&s;s, the &s;tate of his mind, and the cir|cum&s;tances of his recovery, are admirably deline|ated
<PB N="13" REF="025154_0011_0FCE72414D21C548">
in a poetical e&s;&s;ay which is &s;ubjoined to the&s;e memoirs.</P>
<P>One con&s;equence of this &s;ickne&s;s was, in the opinion of Dr. Watts, a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for all the mi&s;eries which he endured. It was the means of introducing him to the family of an excellent per&s;on, Sir THOMAS ABNEY, alder|man of London, who, on a mo&s;t generous prin|ciple, invited him to his hou&s;e whil&s;t in a low and langui&s;hing &s;tate; where, for <HI>thirty-&s;ix</HI> years, he was treated with all the tenderne&s;s of fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;hip, and all the attention and re&s;pect which po|litene&s;s, aided by an ample fortune, could dictate. Sir Thomas died in about eight years after the Doctor's coming to re&s;ide in his family; but he continued with his lady and her daughters to the end of his life, and the lady died in a year after him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The la&s;t branch of this amiable family, ELIZABETH ABNEY, died at Stoke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ewington in 1782. Her character for piety, prudence and benev|olence, was worthy of one who had enjoyed the in&s;tructions and example of Dr. Watts.
<BIBL>PALMER.</BIBL></NOTE> An elegiac ode on the death of Sir Thomas is in the appendix.</P>
<P>In that delightful retirement, without any care of his own, he had every thing which could con|tribute to the enjoyment of life, and favour the pur&s;uit of his &s;tudies. He had the privilege of the country air and elegant gardens at Theobalds in Hertford&s;hire, twelve miles from London; he &s;aw company, or lived reclu&s;e, as be&s;t &s;uited his inclination, and the delicacy of his nervous &s;y&s;tem. It was not till October 1716 that he was able, in any degree, to re&s;ume his public mini&s;try; and in the mean time, his a&s;&s;i&s;tant,
<PB N="14" REF="025154_0012_0FCE72742AC89F18">
Mr. PRICE, was, at his de&s;ire and upon his re|commendation, cho&s;en by the church to be his colleague, and was ordained on the 3d of March, 1713. The inviolable friend&s;hip which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them is evidenced by a clau&s;e in the Doctor's will, in which he &s;tyles him "his faith|ful friend and companion in the labours of the mini&s;try," and leaves him a legacy "as only a &s;mall te&s;timony of his great affection for him, on account of his &s;ervices of love during the ma|ny harmonious years of their fellow&s;hip in the work of the go&s;pel."</P>
<P>From the time of his reception into the kind and ho&s;pitable family of ABNEY, his life was no otherwi&s;e diver&s;ified than by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of valu|able publications, and his attention to his mini|&s;terial functions when his health permitted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"As fa&s;t as my health increa&s;es, you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves it is de|voted to your edification. It often grieves me to think how poor, feeble and &s;hort, are my pre&s;ent labours among you; and yet what days of faintne&s;s I generally feel after &s;uch an attempt. So that I am continu|ally prevented in my de&s;ign of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive vi&s;its to you, by the want of active &s;pirits, whil&s;t I tarry in the city. And if I attempt to &s;tay but a week or ten days there, I find a &s;en&s;ible return of weakne&s;s. So that I am con&s;trained to retire to the country air, in order to recruit and maintain this little capacity of &s;ervice."

<P>In 1728, the univer&s;ities of Edinburgh and Aberdeen, in a mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, and with|out his knowledge, conferred on him the degree of Doctor in Divinity.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="025154_0013_0FCE72449B6E81B8">In the &s;pring of 1739, he had a paralytic &s;hock which &s;eized one &s;ide, and from which he &s;lowly recovered. For &s;ome time before, and always after this, his letters were dictated by him&s;elf, but written by an amanuen&s;is.</P>
<P>His la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s was rather a decay of nature, worn out with infirmity and labour, than any particular di&s;temper. His weakne&s;s increa&s;ed by degrees, and at length confined him to his chamber and his bed, where gradually &s;inking, he at la&s;t died without pain, on the 25th of No|vember, 1748, in the 75th year of his age.</P>
<P>Toward the clo&s;e of life the active and &s;pright|ly powers of his mind failed; yet his confidence in GOD, through the mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, remained un&s;haken. He was heard to &s;ay, "I ble&s;s GOD, I can lie down with comfort at night, not being &s;olicitous whether I awake in this world or another."&mdash;"I &s;hould be glad to read more, not to be more confirmed in the truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion or of its promi&s;es; for I believe them enough to venture an eternity upon them." When he was almo&s;t broken down by his infirmities, he ob&s;erved in conver|&s;ation with a friend, that "he remembered an aged mini&s;ter who u&s;ed to &s;ay that the mo&s;t learn|ed and eminent chri&s;tians, when they come to die, have only the &s;ame plain promi&s;es of the go&s;pel for their &s;upport as the common and un|learned. So, &s;aid he, I find it. The plain promi&s;es of the go&s;pel are my &s;upport, and I ble&s;s GOD that they are plain promi&s;es, that do not require much labor and pains to under&s;tand them; for I can do nothing now but look into
<PB N="16" REF="025154_0014_0FCE7275E1CA5848">
my bible for &s;ome promi&s;e to &s;upport me, and live upon that."</P>
<P>When he found his temper tending to impa|tience and ready to complain, that he could lead only a mere animal life, he would check him|&s;elf thus.&mdash;"The bu&s;ine&s;s of a chri&s;tian is to <HI>bear</HI> the will of GOD as well as to <HI>do</HI> it. If I were in health I could only be doing it; and I may bear it now. The be&s;t thing in obedience is a regard to the will of GOD; and the way to that is to get our inclinations and aver&s;ions as much as po&s;&s;ible mortified." With &s;uch a calm and peaceful mind, and with &s;uch a lively hope did this faithful &s;ervant wi&s;h for the &s;ummons, and enter into the joy of his Lord.</P>
<P>As a man, Dr. Watts was certainly a mo&s;t amiable and excellent character. Could ap|plau&s;e cheri&s;h the laurels which candor and piety have placed on his brow, they would flouri&s;h with immortal verdure. Pure and undi&s;&s;embled <HI>piety</HI> was the &s;ettled habit of his mind. Though he loved and enjoyed much retirement, yet he did not contract any thing of an affected &s;tiffne&s;s or monki&s;h au&s;terity; but on the contrary, the plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction which he found in com|munion with GOD in &s;olitude, made him the more ea&s;y and cheerful in his conver&s;e with men.</P>
<P>His <HI>humility</HI> was like a deep &s;hade to &s;et off his other virtues, and made them &s;hine with a brighter lu&s;tre. Though by his natural temper he was quick in re&s;entment, yet by his fixed habit he was gentle and inoffen&s;ive. This ac|quired habit had no &s;mall effect in forming his
<PB N="17" REF="025154_0015_0FCE7245B0721980">
&s;entiments. For he thought he could not be laid too low, as a creature or a &s;inner, that he might do honor to the perfections and grace of GOD. From this principle, in a great mea&s;ure, ro&s;e that high e&s;teem which he had for the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;o apparently calculated to exalt GOD and to humble man. Nor was his humility le&s;s con&s;picuous in his outward be|havior towards others. Hence flowed that con|de&s;cention, humanity and kindne&s;s, which could not but endear him to all who had the plea&s;ure of conver&s;ing with him, and which rendered him truly venerable in a much higher degree, than all the honors and applau&s;es which he received from the world.</P>
<P>In clo&s;e connection with the grace of humili|ty were to be &s;een his <HI>candor</HI> and <HI>charity,</HI> for which he was remarkably eminent. The love which he bore to his Saviour induced him cor|dially to embrace all whom he e&s;teemed his gen|uine di&s;ciples. No party names, no variety of &s;entiments in matters of doubtful di&s;putation, nor of practice in mode of wor&s;hip, could divide him in affection from &s;uch as he had rea&s;on to hope loved Chri&s;t in &s;incerity. He therefore main|tained a free and friendly corre&s;pondence with chri&s;tians of various parties and denominations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In one of his letters to Dr. Colman, after thanking him for his picture, he &s;ays, "I have put it in a frame that it may hang in the &s;ame rank with Dr. Increa&s;e and Dr. Cotton Mather, in the front of my &s;tudy.

Though he judged the principles of the mode|rate nonconformi&s;ts mo&s;t favorable to chri&s;tian liberty, and the rights of con&s;cience, and their forms of wor&s;hip mo&s;t agreeable to the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, yet he had a high veneration for the per&s;ons and writings of many mini&s;ters and chri&s;tians of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, as many of them had for him and his works.</P>
<P>In the delineation of his character Dr. John|&s;on has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lives of the Poets. vol. 111.</NOTE> "&s;uch was he as eve|ry chri&s;tian church would rejoice to have adopt|ed." To which he afterward &s;ubjoins. "Hap|py will be that reader who&s;e mind is di&s;po&s;ed by his ver&s;es or his pro&s;e to imitate him <HI>in all but his non-conformity,</HI> to copy his benevolence to man and his reverence to GOD."</P>
<P>This is doubtle&s;s the highe&s;t prai&s;e which it was in the power of &s;uch a man as Dr. John|&s;on to be&s;tow; being him&s;elf a pious and zealous member of the epi&s;copal communion e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in <HI>South</HI> Britain, he thought a conformity to that church e&s;&s;ential to chri&s;tian perfection. But to other good men who do not &s;ee perfec|tion thro' that medium, the non-conformity of Dr. Watts is &s;o far from being a blemi&s;h in his character, that it is really an evidence of his hero|ic virtue. Born and educated among the di&s;&s;ent|ers in a time which tried men's &s;ouls, he had early been taught to &s;uffer in the cau&s;e of truth; and he could not think le&s;s favorably of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iety and &s;incerity of his brethren for the humiliating le&s;&s;ons which they had learned in the &s;chool of per&s;ecution. Had he gone over to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
<PB N="19" REF="025154_0017_0FCE7248E365CC50">
(e&s;pecially about the time of his ordination) he would have incurred the odium, not only of &s;eeking his per&s;onal &s;afety and worldly emolument by de&s;erting his brethren in a time of danger, but of joining the party who had in their hands the power of oppre&s;&s;ing them. Such views as the&s;e his generous &s;oul abhorred; and therefore cir|cum&s;tanced as he was, a conformity to the e&s;tab|li&s;hment, in&s;tead of adding lu&s;tre to his character would have greatly detracted from it. Firm to his principles, attached to his brethren, and fear|le&s;s of per&s;onal danger; he cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer affliction with the people of GOD, than to ba&s;k in the &s;un&s;hine of courtly favor and &s;tand candi|date for eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities.</P>
<P>But his choice was not merely the re&s;ult of prejudice or attachment. He had candidly and thoroughly examined the controver&s;y, and was per&s;uaded in his own mind, that a di&s;&s;ent from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church was warrantable and &s;afe. His ideas of religious liberty were generous, and his candor toward other men exten&s;ive; but, for him&s;elf, he preferred the original &s;implicity of go&s;pel in&s;titutions to the ornaments and inven|tions of later ages. His ideas on this head can|not be better explained than in a &s;hort and elegant e&s;&s;ay publi&s;hed among his po&s;thumous works, in|titled, "The Diamond Painted," which may be &s;een in the appendix.</P>
<P>Though Dr. Watts pa&s;&s;ed his whole life in a &s;tate of celibacy, yet it is evident, from &s;everal of his poems, particularly tho&s;e on Queen Mary and Lady Sunderland, that he was far from being in|&s;en&s;ible to female charms; and from his "In|dian

The late Dr. COLMAN of Bo&s;ton, who was intimately acquainted both with Dr. Watts and Mi&s;s Singer, u&s;ed to tell this &s;tory; that after long he&s;itation and delay, Dr. Watts ventured to declare to Mi&s;s Singer his affection for her and to a&s;k her hand; to which he re|ceived an an&s;wer which mu&s;t have mortified him extremely; that &s;he had long expected his ad|dre&s;&s;es, but had on the preceding <HI>day</HI> given her con&s;ent to the &s;olicitation of Mr. ROWE.

tho&s;e who are li&s;ping their fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons to the profound inquirers into moral philo&s;ophy. He has left neither corporeal nor &s;piritual nature un|examined; he has taught the art of rea&s;oning and the &s;cience of the &s;tars. For the benefit of chil|dren he conde&s;cended to lay a&s;ide the &s;cholar, the philo&s;opher and the wit, to write little poems of devotion and &s;y&s;tems of in&s;truction adapted to their wants and capacities, from the dawn of rea&s;on through its gradations of advance in the morning of life. Every man acquainted with the common principles of human action, will look with veneration on the writer who is at one time combating LOCKE, and at another mak|ing a catechi&s;m for children in their fourth year. A voluntary de&s;cent from the dignity of &s;cience is perhaps the harde&s;t le&s;&s;on which humility can teach.</P>
<P>As his mind was capacious, his curio&s;ity ex|cur&s;ive, and his indu&s;try continual, his writings are very numerous, and his &s;ubjects various. His character, as an author, mu&s;t therefore be form|ed from the multiplicity and diver&s;ity of his at|tainments, rather than from any &s;ingle perform|ance. It would not be &s;afe to claim for him the highe&s;t rank in any &s;ingle denomination of lite|rary dignity; yet perhaps there was nothing in which he would not have excelled if he had not divided his powers to different pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>As a <HI>poet,</HI> had he been only a poet, he would have &s;tood high among authors of that cla&s;s. His judgment was exact, and he noted beauties and faults with very nice di&s;cernment. His im|agination was vigorous and active, and the &s;tores
<PB N="22" REF="025154_0020_0FCE727D2D3B4CC8">
of knowledge were large by which his imagina|tion were &s;upplied. His ear was well tuned, and his diction was elegant and copious. But his devotional poetry is (in the opinion of Dr. John|&s;on) un&s;atisfactory. The paucity of its topics en|forces perpetual repetition, and the &s;anctity of its matter rejects the ornaments of figurative diction. "It is &s;ufficient," &s;ays this critic, "that Watts hath done better than others, what no man has done well."</P>
<P>The propriety of the&s;e remarks has been con|troverted. "There is no &s;ubject," &s;ays Mr. Palmer, "who&s;e topics are &s;o various as tho&s;e which religion &s;upplies, or which are better adapted to admit of poetical images. Religion comprehends all the perfections and works of the Deity, the wonders of nature and Providence, and the greater wonders of grace and redemption; the incarnation, life, miracles, &s;ufferings, death and re&s;urrection of the Son of GOD; the awful &s;cenes of mortality, the re&s;urrection of the dead, the &s;olemnity of the future judgment and of eter|nity, as well as the &s;ublime virtues of piety and benevolence. The&s;e general &s;ubjects, with all their &s;ubordinates, &s;upply an infinite variety of topics, and admit a figurative diction. Witne&s;s the &s;ublime compo&s;ures of the &s;acred prophets, in which the loftie&s;t images and bolde&s;t figures are introduced in almo&s;t every line."</P>
<P>His poems on other &s;ubjects &s;eldom ri&s;e high|er than might have been expected from the amu&s;e|ments of a man of letters, and have different de|grees of value as they are more or le&s;s labored, or as the occa&s;ion was more or le&s;s favorable to in|vention.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="025154_0021_0FCE724C6A72B300">As he writes often without regular mea&s;ures, and too often in blank ver&s;e, the rhymes are not always &s;ufficiently corre&s;pondent. His lines are commonly &s;mooth and ea&s;y, and his thoughts re|ligiou&s;ly pure. He is at lea&s;t one of tho&s;e few poets with whom the young and unlearned may be &s;afely plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Of his <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> works, his logic as well as his geography and a&s;tronomy, have been received into the univer&s;ities both of Britain and America, and therefore need no further recommendation. If he owes any thing to LE CLERC, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered that no man who undertakes merely to methodi&s;e or illu&s;trate a &s;y&s;tem, pretends to be its author.</P>
<P>In his <HI>metaphy&s;ical</HI> di&s;qui&s;itions, it was ob&s;erv|ed by the late learned Mr. DYER, that he con|founded the idea of <HI>&s;pace</HI> with that of <HI>empty &s;pace</HI>; and did not con&s;ider that though &s;pace might be without matter, yet matter could not be without &s;pace.</P>
<P>Few books have been peru&s;ed by the judicious with greater plea&s;ure or are more u&s;eful than his "Improvement of the Mind;" of which the radical principles may indeed be found in LOCKE's "Conduct of the Under&s;tanding;" but they are &s;o expanded and ramified by Watts as to confer upon him the merit of a work in the highe&s;t de|gree u&s;eful and plea&s;ing. Whoever has the care of in&s;tructing others, may be charged with de|ficience in his duty if this book be not recom|mended.</P>
<P>In his <HI>controver&s;ial</HI> works, we cannot but ad|mire the meekne&s;s of his oppo&s;ition and the mild|ne&s;s
<PB N="24" REF="025154_0022_0FCE727EABFD6DC8">
of his cen&s;ures. It was not only in his book, but in his mind, that <HI>orthodoxy</HI> was united with <HI>charity.</HI> When he engaged in controver&s;y, it was evidently with a view to heal and recon|cile di&s;putes among chri&s;tians, rather than to make pro&s;elytes to any party: however any may differ from him in judgment, all mu&s;t allow, that he wrote on &s;uch occa&s;ions with a &s;pirit of moderation, meekne&s;s and love, which was truly exemplary. This moderation however expo&s;ed him to the &s;everity of the bigots of oppo&s;ite par|ties, who are generally di&s;po&s;ed to give no quar|ter to the man who is of no party. Of this Dr. Watts was &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible, and it was fre|quently remarked by him, that "a moderate man mu&s;t expect a box on both ears."</P>
<P>Whatever &s;ubject he took in hand was, by his ince&s;&s;ant &s;olicitude for &s;ouls, converted to theolo|gy. As piety predominated in his mind, it is diffu&s;ed over all his writings; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to read a page in his works without learning, or at lea&s;t wi&s;hing to be better.</P>
<P>His own account of his &s;ermons is this,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dedication of his 1&s;t vol. of &s;ermons to his church.</NOTE> "I have not entertained you with lectures of philo&s;|ophy in&s;tead of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; nor have I affected that ea&s;y indolence of &s;tyle, which is the cold and in&s;ipid plea&s;ure of men who pretend to politene&s;s. You know it has always been the bu&s;ine&s;s of my mini&s;try to convince and per|&s;uade your &s;ouls into practical godline&s;s, by the cleare&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons derived from the go&s;pel, and by all the mo&s;t moving methods of &s;peech of which I was capable; but &s;till in a

humble &s;ub&s;erviency to the promi&s;ed influences of the holy &s;pirit. I ever thought it my duty to pre&s;s the conviction with force on the con|&s;cience, when light was fir&s;t let into the mind. A &s;tatue hung round with moral &s;entences, or a marble pillar in&s;cribed with divine truth, may coldly preach to the under&s;tanding, whil&s;t devo|tion freezes at the heart; but the prophets and apo&s;tles were burning and &s;hining lights. They were taught by in&s;piration to make the words of truth glitter like &s;un-beams, and to operate like a two-edged &s;word. The movements of &s;acred pa&s;&s;ion may be the ridicule of an age which pre|tends to nothing but calm rea&s;oning. Life and zeal in the mini&s;try of the word may be de&s;pi&s;ed by men of lukewarm and dying religion. Fer|vency of &s;pirit in the &s;ervice of the Lord, may become the &s;coff and je&s;t of the critic and the profane; but this very life and zeal, this &s;acred fervency will remain a bright character of a chri&s;|tian preacher, till the names of PAUL and APOL|LOS peri&s;h from the church, till the bible and the heavens be no more."</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of Dr. Watts's character, as drawn by Dr. Gibbons, is this: "His truth and &s;incerity were very con&s;picuous. There was no|thing in him which could be &s;tyled art and de|&s;ign. He never di&s;covered in his behaviour or conver&s;ation any thing like a high opinion of him&s;elf, nor did he &s;hew a di&s;po&s;ition to traduce or depreciate the characters and abilities of others. In meats and drinks he was very moderate. There was nothing in him which betrayed a penurious temper. He was very rich, but it was in good
<PB N="26" REF="025154_0024_0FCE72804746D2D0">
works, for he de&s;ired not to lay up his trea&s;ure on earth, but in heaven.</P>
<P>"He never di&s;covered any thing like a furious zeal or a narrow deci&s;ive &s;pirit; but cordially em|braced all whom he e&s;teemed the genuine di&s;ci|ples of his Lord.</P>
<P>"His &s;oul, which glowed with gratitude for the favors he received, was al&s;o eminent for its friend&s;hip. He was nobly avaricious of time, and ever watchful to improve it."</P>
<P>But there was one di&s;tingui&s;hing feature in his character which both Gibbons and John&s;on have entirely pa&s;&s;ed over, and that was his love of truth, and his freedom, impartiality, diligence and hu|mility in his inquiries after it. It is indeed a character &s;eldom to be met with, though of pe|culiar importance in a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter, and therefore ought to be noticed with particular ap|probation. In Dr. Watts it was con&s;picuous in a very eminent degree.</P>
<P>"In matters of the chri&s;tian faith," &s;aith he,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;cellaneous Thoughts, No. XLIX.</NOTE> "I would make the &s;cripture my guide and en|ter into a calm conference with my&s;elf in a &s;ur|vey of the oracles of GOD, in order to a deci&s;ion of the &s;en&s;e and meaning of them, not neglecting the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of pious and learned authors, but conver&s;ing very little with the angry and &s;uper|cilious. I would with daily importunity addre&s;s the Father of Lights to &s;hine upon his own word, and to di&s;cover his own meaning. I would hum|bly implore the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and revelation to take the things of Chri&s;t, and &s;hew them to my under&s;tanding in a mo&s;t convincing light.

But if an inqui&s;itive mind overleap the bounds of faith, and give the reins to all our rea&s;onings on divine themes, in &s;o wide and open a field as that of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">les and pro|bables, it is no ea&s;y matter to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> where they will &s;top.

<P>The man who was capable of giving &s;uch ad|vice as this, for the inve&s;tigation of truth, mu&s;t him&s;elf be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;incere lover of truth, and a diligent, humble, impartial inquirer after it.

Few men have more entirely dive&s;ted them&s;elves of the prejudi|ces of education, or have di&s;covered greater im|partiality of inquiring and openne&s;s to conviction, than Dr. Watts. Though not ha&s;ty in giving up his early opinions, and very far from affecting a love of novelty in his religious &s;entiments, it may truly be &s;aid of him, that he &s;ought for truth as for hidden trea&s;ures.

<P>Dr. Watts was a firm and zealous friend to New England, and kept up a corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of our principal characters, both in the civil and clerical lines. Among the&s;e were Governors SHUTE and BELCHER, Drs. MA|THER and COLMAN, Me&s;&s;. PRINCE and FOX|CROFT, Pre&s;idents WILLIAMS, CLAP, and EDWARDS. Almo&s;t every gentleman who went from this country to England was fond of being recommended and introduced to him, and they always met with a welcome and cordial recep|tion. He frequently &s;olicited benefactions, and made donations, particularly of books, to the colleges at Cambridge and New-Haven, and to the Indian mi&s;&s;ions on our ea&s;tern and we&s;tern

borders. His memory has always been de&s;erv|edly famous and re&s;pected here. His p&s;alms and hymns, his divine &s;ongs and catechi&s;ms are high|ly in vogue, and have perhaps been more condu|cive to a&s;&s;i&s;t the devotion of chri&s;tians, and the in&s;truction of children, than any other writings, except the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>His imitation of the p&s;alms of David in the language of the New Te&s;tament, is generally al|lowed to be his capital production in poetry, though it is not particularly noticed by John&s;on, who has critici&s;ed his poems in general. Tho&s;e congregations who u&s;e it, have advantages for evangelical devotion &s;uperior to tho&s;e who adhere to the other ver&s;ions. Its local imperfections have been remedied, and its deficiences &s;upplied, in an American edition publi&s;hed by Mr. BAR|LOW, which is now coming into general u&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the p&s;alms, Dr. Watts compo&s;ed three books of <HI>hymns and &s;piritual &s;ongs,</HI> which con|tain many &s;pecimens of &s;ublime and devotional poetry, calculated for the edification of chri&s;tian &s;ocieties, and recommended by the plainne&s;s of the compo&s;ition and the &s;moothne&s;s of the ver&s;e. If in &s;ome in&s;tances they may be thought le&s;s judicious than the p&s;alms, it ought to be con&s;i|dered that mo&s;t of them were written when the author was very young, and &s;ome when he was but a &s;chool boy. It is much to be wi&s;hed that in his mature age he had corrected what was ju|venile, and what he freely acknowledged to be faulty in &s;ome of the&s;e early compo&s;ures. The late Mr. HENRY GROVE remarked to the Doc|tor, that &s;everal of his hymns laid the &s;tre&s;s of

The Doctor an&s;wered that he &s;hould be glad to do it, but it was out of his power, for he had parted with the copy, and the book&s;eller would not &s;uffer any &s;uch alteration.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that &s;o low was the author's expectation with regard to the &s;ucce&s;s of this work, that, it is &s;aid, he received no more than ten pounds &s;terling for the copy.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Palmer, p. 28.</NOTE></P>
<P>It may not be improper in this place to take notice of what has been publi&s;hed to the world by Mr. BENJAMIN WILLIAMS in the preface to his collection of p&s;alms. He repre&s;ents Dr. Watts as "a per&s;on of the mo&s;t exemplary meek|ne&s;s and humility, perfectly good natured, and of &s;uch unconfined charity, that he wi&s;hed to avoid every word and &s;yllable which was likely to give the &s;malle&s;t offence to &s;erious chri&s;tians of any denomination; and when he found in the latter part of his life, that he had not been &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|ful in this re&s;pect as he had aimed to be, he wi&s;h|ed for nothing more ardently than &s;ufficient health and time to revi&s;e both his p&s;alms and hymns, in order to render them wholly unexcep|tionable to every chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"This account, Mr. Williams ob&s;erves, was received from Dr. Watts him&s;elf a few years be|fore his death, by Dr. AMORY, and by him giv|en to one of his pupils, who communicated it to
<PB N="33" REF="025154_0031_0FCED97779E0D560">
the editor. The editor al&s;o &s;ays he had good rea&s;on to add that "the revi&s;al &s;o fervently wi&s;hed for, was undertaken and fini&s;hed, and would mo&s;t certainly have been publi&s;hed, had not the author's death unhappily prevented."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Monthly Review, 178<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. p. 170.</NOTE></P>
<P>On this Mr. Palmer remarks thus: "With|out impeaching this writer's veracity, the evi|dence of the fact is by no means &s;atisfactory. What became of the copy thus corrected? Mr. PARKER, the Doctor's amanuen&s;is, knows of no &s;uch thing, and never heard of the author's having &s;uch a de&s;ign, which appears indeed high|ly improbable. A man of Dr. Watts's know|ledge of the world could hardly expect that he &s;hould be able to make every thing in the&s;e compo|&s;ures univer&s;ally unexceptionable, as the altera|tions which would have gratified one party, would equally have offended another.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Palmer, p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">8.</NOTE></P>
<P>As the Lives of Dr. WATTS and Dr. DOD|DRIDGE are united in this publication, it may not be improper to take notice of the beginning and progre&s;s of their connexion with each other. Doddridge was about twenty-eight years young|er than Watts, and had no acquaintance with him till it was introduced in the following manner. Doddridge being a hopeful and ri&s;ing young min|i&s;ter among the di&s;&s;enters, was reque&s;ted by a Mr. BENYON, of Shrew&s;bury, to write his thoughts on the be&s;t method of conducting the preparatory &s;tu|dies of young gentlemen intended for the mini&s;try. When he had ju&s;t fini&s;hed the work, his friend died, and the treati&s;e remained in his own hands.
<PB N="34" REF="025154_0032_0FCE72895E65EBE0">
Mr. SAUNDERS, of Kettering, happening to &s;ee it in his &s;tudy, borrowed it and &s;hewed it to Dr. Watts. He was much plea&s;ed with the plan, and having made &s;ome remarks upon it, com|municated it to &s;everal of his friends. They all joined with him in &s;oliciting Doddridge to carry it into execution. This was the beginning of that famous academy in which Doddridge &s;hone with the highe&s;t lu&s;tre as a tutor, and al&s;o of an intimate friend&s;hip between him and Dr. Watts.</P>
<P>It had been for many years one of Dr. Watts's earne&s;t de&s;ires to compo&s;e a treati&s;e of practical and experimental divinity; but his growing in|firmities prevented his executing it. He there|fore &s;trongly recommended the matter to Dod|dridge as the fitte&s;t per&s;on in his acquaintance to perform it in the mo&s;t acceptable manner. It was with much reluctance that he undertook &s;uch a work among his other con&s;tant and weigh|ty concerns. But Dr. Watts's heart was &s;o much &s;et on the de&s;ign, and he urged it with &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing importunity, that Doddridge could not deny his reque&s;t, after having been honored with his friend&s;hip for &s;o many years, and re|ceiving much encouragement and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him, in &s;everal of his undertakings. When it was fini&s;hed, Dr. Watts revi&s;ed as much of it as his health would permit, and it was fir&s;t pub|li&s;hed in 1745, unter the title of "The Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Religion in the Soul," with a dedi|cation to Dr. Watts.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton's Life of Doddridge, chap. III and VII.</NOTE></P>
<P>The opinion which Dr. Watts had of Dod|dridge appears from the following letter which
<PB N="35" REF="025154_0033_0FCE725B99A51BF8">
he wrote to Mr. Longueville, mini&s;ter of the Engli&s;h church at Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>"It is a very agreeable employment to which you call me, and a very &s;en&s;ible honor you put upon me when you de&s;ire me to give you my &s;entiments of that reverend and learned writer Dr. Doddridge, to be prefixed to a tran&s;lation of any of his works into the Dutch tongue. I have well known him many years, and have enjoyed a con&s;tant intimacy and friend&s;hip with him ever &s;ince the providence of GOD called him to be a profe&s;&s;or of human &s;ciences, and a teacher of &s;a|cred theology to young men among us who are trained up for the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel. I have no need to give you a large account of his know|ledge in the &s;ciences, in which I confe&s;s him to be greatly my &s;uperior; and as to the doctrines of divinity and the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, I know not any man of greater &s;kill than him&s;elf, and hardly &s;ufficient to be his &s;econd. As he hath a mo&s;t exact acquaintance with the things of GOD and our holy religion, &s;o far as we are let into them by the light of nature and the revelations of &s;criptures, &s;o he hath a mo&s;t happy manner of teaching tho&s;e who are younger. He hath a mo&s;t &s;kilful and conde&s;cending way of in&s;truc|tion, nor is there any per&s;on of my acquaintance with whom I am more <HI>entirely agreed</HI> in all the &s;entiments of the doctrine of Chri&s;t. He is a mo&s;t hearty believer of the great articles and im|portant principles of the reformed church; a mo&s;t affectionate preacher, and pathetic writer on the practical parts of religion; and, in one word, &s;ince I am now advanced in age beyond my &s;e|ventieth

year (1745) if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were any man to whom Providence would &s;uffer me to commit a &s;econd part of my life and u&s;efulne&s;s in the church of Chri&s;t, Dr. Doddridge &s;hould be the man. If you have read that excellent performance of his, intitled, "<HI>The Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s,</HI>" &amp;c. you will be of my mind. His dedication of it to me is the only thing in the book I could hardly permit my&s;elf to approve. Be&s;ides all this, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth a &s;pirit of &s;o much charity, love, and goodne&s;s toward his fellow chri&s;tians, who may fall into &s;ome le&s;&s;er differences of opinion, as be|cometh a follower of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, his ma&s;|ter and mine. In the practical part of his la|bors and mini&s;try, he hath &s;ufficiently &s;hewn him&s;elf mo&s;t happily furni&s;hed with all proper gifts and talents, to lead per&s;ons of all ranks and ages to &s;erious piety and &s;trict religion. I e&s;teem it a con&s;iderable honor which the provi|dence of GOD hath done, when it makes u&s;e of me as an in&s;trument in his hands, to promote the u&s;efulne&s;s of this great man in any part of the world; and it is my hearty prayer, that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t may ble&s;s all his labors with mo&s;t glorious &s;ucce&s;s."</P>
<P>So high an e&s;teem had he of this valuable friend, that by his la&s;t will he left the care of his manu&s;cripts, and of republi&s;hing his printed works, to him, in conjunction with Dr. DAVID JENNINGS. Doddridge died in 1752, and the complete edition of Watts's works in &s;ix quar|to volumes, came out in 1753. Many of his works have &s;ince been reprinted &s;eparately, and it is probable that future editions of them will be called for by the pious and learned of &s;uc|ceeding ages.</P>

They recollected their hours and days of bitter|ne&s;s, and the workings of their &s;oul amid&s;t their &s;harp and grievous &s;orrows, to make the remem|brance of their &s;alvation the &s;weeter, and &s;o kin|dle the zeal of their gratitude to a higher flame. Is it a matter of blame to imitate &s;uch exam|ples? Doth not the rea&s;on hold good in our age, and to all generations? Why &s;hould a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> be any more afraid to tell the world of his af|flictions or di&s;tre&s;&s;es than a <HI>Jew?</HI> Or why &s;hould he be a&s;hamed to let them know, that amid&s;t tho&s;e &s;inkings of life and nature, <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> and the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> were his &s;upport? Amid&s;t all the vi|olence of my di&s;temper, and the tire&s;ome months of it, I thank GOD I never lo&s;t &s;ight of rea&s;on or religion, though &s;ometimes I had much ado to pre&s;erve the machine of animal nature in &s;uch order as regularly to exerci&s;e either the man or the chri&s;tian, e&s;pecially when I &s;hut my eyes to &s;eek &s;leep and repo&s;e, and had not their aid to fence again&s;t the di&s;orderly ferments of natural &s;pirits. But the&s;e conflicts are de&s;cribed in the following lines. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD for pre&s;erving and healing mercy!</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="dedication">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR grief is great and ju&s;t. It is not in the power of ver&s;e to charm it: Your com|forts mu&s;t ari&s;e from a diviner &s;pring. My re&s;i|dence in your family hath made me a witne&s;s to the lu&s;tre of Sir THOMAS ABNEY's character, and to the years of your felicity; and I bear a &s;en&s;ible &s;hare in the &s;orrows that are &s;hed on his tomb.</P>
<P>The <HI>nation</HI> mourns a good man lo&s;t from the mid&s;t of us, a public ble&s;&s;ing vani&s;h'd from the earth. The <HI>city</HI> mourns the lo&s;s of a mo&s;t ex|cellent magi&s;trate, a &s;ure friend to virtue, and a guardian to the public peace. The CHURCH of CHRIST mourns a beautiful pillar taken from the &s;upport and ornament of the temple. All the&s;e are public &s;orrows; but <HI>your lo&s;s,</HI> MADAM, carries a pain in it, that mu&s;t be unknown to all but &s;uch as knew the dome&s;tic virtues of the de|cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have the honor of your Lady&s;hip's acquaintance, can tell whence you derive your daily con&s;olations; even from that world where
<PB N="54" REF="025154_0052_0FCE72A0233F8F40">
your departed relative drinks them at the foun|tain head. O may tho&s;e &s;treams de&s;cend in full mea&s;ure hourly, and refre&s;h your&s;elf and your mourning hou&s;e!</P>
<P>But if a ver&s;e cannot give comfort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>liv|ing,</HI> yet it may do honor to the <HI>dead<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> and 'tis for this rea&s;on that your Lady&s;hip de&s;ire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a ver&s;e to attend the&s;e few memorials of Sir THOMAS ABNEY's life. His mode&s;ty hath concealed a thou&s;and things from the world which might have &s;tood as witne&s;&s;es of his piety and goodne&s;s, but he thought it &s;ufficient that his record was on high: yet your unfeigned love follows him to the grave, and would do every thing that might adorn his name and memory. Since you have called me to this piece of &s;ervice, the obli|gations that your Lady&s;hip hath laid upon me are &s;trong enough to &s;ummon up my youthful powers and talents, even when I look upon them as buried and almo&s;t forgotten.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, MADAM, there are &s;ome occurrences that can of them&s;elves rouze the mu&s;e from the deepe&s;t &s;leep. Poe&s;y is not always under the command of the will. As there have been oc|ca&s;ions heretofore when I have wi&s;hed to write, but the imagination has refu&s;ed to attend the wi&s;h; &s;o there are &s;ea&s;ons when ver&s;e comes al|mo&s;t without a call, and the will might re&s;i&s;t in vain. A few &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons have I met with in the cour&s;e of my life, and &s;ome of them have found me even in the chambers of death. When I have &s;pent days in the mid&s;t of mourning, and the whole &s;oul hath been turned to &s;orrow, the harp hath &s;ounded of its own accord, and awak|ened
<PB N="55" REF="025154_0053_0FCE72D736850418">
all the doleful &s;trings. Such was the hour when your dear and honored brother Mr. THO|MAS GUNSTON departed this life; and &s;uch is the pre&s;ent providence. Uncommon worth for|&s;aking our world, &s;trikes all the powers of na|ture with &s;entiments of honor and grief, and the hand and the heart con&s;ent to rai&s;e a monument of love and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Accept then, <HI>honored</HI> MADAM, the&s;e lines of <HI>elegy,</HI> as a &s;incere pledge of the greate&s;t venera|tion which my heart pays to the memory of Sir THOMAS ABNEY. How far &s;oever the ver&s;e may fall below the theme, yet now it mu&s;t al|ways live, &s;ince it is joined to the&s;e <HI>memoirs,</HI> and attached to a character that cannot die. And while &s;ucceeding ages &s;hall read the honors due to the decea&s;ed, let them know al&s;o the gratitude I pay to your <HI>Lady&s;hip,</HI> for the &s;ignal benefits of many years conferred on</P>

<P>HOW wide and unhappy a mi&s;take it is when chri&s;tians endeavour to adorn their <HI>pure divine wor&s;hip</HI> by the mixture of it with <HI>ceremonies</HI> of <HI>human invention.</HI> The &s;ymbolical ordinanances of the go&s;pel have a noble &s;impli|city in them: Their <HI>materials</HI> are <HI>water, bread</HI> and <HI>wine,</HI> three of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and valu|able things in human life; and their <HI>my&s;tic &s;en&s;e</HI> is plain, natural and ea&s;y. By <HI>water</HI> we are clean&s;ed when we have been defiled; &s;o by the <HI>grace</HI> of the <HI>holy Spirit</HI> we are purified from &s;in, which pollutes our &s;ouls in the &s;ight of GOD. By <HI>bread</HI> we are fed when we are hungry, and nouri&s;hed into &s;trength for &s;ervice: By <HI>wine</HI> we are refre&s;hed and revived when thir&s;ty and faint|ing; &s;o from the <HI>body of Chri&s;t</HI> which was bro|ken as an atoning &s;acrifice, and his blood which was poured out for us, we derive our &s;piritual
<PB N="74" REF="025154_0072_0FCE72B56B607248">
life and &s;trength. The application of the&s;e &s;ym|bols is mo&s;t &s;imple, and natural al&s;o: We are commanded to <HI>wa&s;h</HI> with the water, to <HI>eat</HI> the bread, and to <HI>drink</HI> the wine: mo&s;t proper re|pre&s;entations of our participation of the&s;e bene|fits.</P>
<P>Thus much of figures and emblems did the all-wi&s;e GOD think proper to appoint and con|tinue in his church, when he brake the yoke of <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> bondage, and aboli&s;hed a multitude of rites and ceremonies of his own ancient appoint|ment. How plain, how natural, how glorious, how divine are the&s;e two <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> in&s;titutions, <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> if &s;urveyed and practi&s;ed in their original &s;implicity! but they are deba&s;ed by the addition of any fanta&s;tic orna|ments.</P>
<P>What think ye of all the gaudy trappings and golden finery that is mingled with the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> wor&s;hip by the imaginations of men in the church of <HI>Rome?</HI> Are they not like &s;o many &s;pots and blemi&s;hes ca&s;t upon a fair jewel by &s;ome fooli&s;h painter? Let the colours be never &s;o &s;prightly and glowing, and the lu&s;tre of the paint never &s;o rich, yet if you place them on a dia|mond they are &s;pots and blemi&s;hes &s;till. Is not this a ju&s;t emblem to repre&s;ent all the gay airs, and rich and glittering accoutrements wherewith the church of <HI>Rome</HI> hath &s;urrounded her devo|tions and her public religion?</P>
<P>The reformers of our wor&s;hip in the <HI>church of England</HI> were much of this mind, for they boldly pa&s;s this cen&s;ure on many of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> ceremonies, that they <HI>entered into the church by

undi&s;creet devotion and zeal without knowledge: They blinded the people, and ob&s;cured the glory of God, and are worthy to be cut away and clean re|jected:</HI> That they did <HI>more confound and darken, than declare and &s;et forth Chri&s;t's benefits unto us,</HI> and reduced us again to a <HI>ceremonial law, like that of Mo&s;es,</HI> and to <HI>the bondage of figures and &s;ha|dows:</HI> This is their &s;entence and judgment con|cerning many of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> rites, in the <HI>preface</HI> to the book of <HI>common prayer.</HI> Happy had it been for <HI>Great Britain</HI> if they had thought &s;o concerning all of them, &s;ince they had all the &s;ame or a wor&s;e original, and they all tend to the &s;ame unhappy end! However, let others take their liberty of colouring all their jewels with what greens and purples and &s;carlets they plea&s;e; but for my own part I like a diamond be&s;t that has no paint upon it.</P>

<HEAD>SECOND APPENDIX. From a Life of Dr. <HI>WATTS,</HI> by <HI>SAMUEL PALMER.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>No. I. An authentic Account of Dr. <HI>WATTS's</HI> la&s;t avowed &s;entiments concerning the Doctrine of the <HI>TRINITY,</HI> the <HI>DEITY</HI> of <HI>CHRIST,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the controver&s;ies which have been agitated in the chri&s;tian church, there is &s;carcely any one that has been more con&s;tantly kept up, or conducted with greater warmth, or with a more intemperate and unchri&s;tian zeal, than that of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> or the Divinity of the Son and Spirit of GOD. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to re|late the different opinions which have been held on the&s;e &s;ubjects, or to mention the names of their authors or principal abettors.</P>
<P>It is well known to mo&s;t readers how the Trinitarian controver&s;y was revived in Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s time, both among the Clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and the Di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters, and to what height matters were carried by the con|tending parties. Some yet living well remem|ber, what it might be wi&s;hed &s;hould for ever be forgotten, the animo&s;ities which prevailed at the meetings of the London mini&s;ters at <HI>Salters Hall,</HI> on the bu&s;ine&s;s of Sub&s;cription to a Te&s;t propo&s;ed for a&s;certaining the orthodoxy of tho&s;e that belonged to that body, with re&s;pect to the&s;e points of doctrine.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="025154_0075_0FCE72B9109BF018">Many of tho&s;e who had been always under|&s;tood to believe them refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe any Te&s;t whatever, and of this number was Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> who, though he was in the main in the orthodox faith, and had written in defence of it, did not choo&s;e to &s;et his hand to any human for|mularies, which might be the occa&s;ion of in|vidious di&s;tinctions and unchri&s;tian &s;eparations among brethren.</P>
<P>In this, as well as other di&s;putable matters, the natural mildne&s;s of his temper, and his en|larged charity, which was the con&s;equence of his impartial inve&s;tigation of &s;o difficult a &s;ub|ject, led him to act the part of a moderator.</P>
<P>In his book entitled <HI>Ort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">xy and Charity united,</HI> he had a view to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">octrine among others, and in&s;erted an E&s;&s;ay to &s;hew the room there is for mutual forbearance and candor.</P>
<P>This moderation which the Doctor profe&s;&s;ed and maintained, led &s;ome party-zealots to &s;up|po&s;e that he had departed from the faith, and there were tho&s;e who &s;crupled not to call him an <HI>Arian.</HI></P>
<P>The truth of the matter was, that he no more de&s;erved this opprobrious name than tho&s;e who &s;tigmatized him with it; tho' it mu&s;t be owned, that his manner of conceiving and explaining &s;ome things relating to the Trinitarian doctrine was different from that of the generality of tho&s;e who were called orthodox.</P>
<P>In the younger part of life he &s;eemed to em|brace the doctrine as it had been commonly &s;ta|ted, and had no objection to the u&s;ual modes of expre&s;&s;ion in relation to it. But, as it was not
<PB N="78" REF="025154_0076_0FCE72BABB1FB630">
his character to take any thing upon tru&s;t, he indulged a freedom of enquiry with re&s;pect to this &s;ubject of debate, as well as every other, and the con&s;equence was, he &s;aw rea&s;on to alter his views concerning it.</P>
<P>With what &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and humility he con|ducted his enquiries, and how earne&s;tly he de|&s;ired to know the truth, appears from a piece found among his manu&s;cripts, entitled <HI>A Solemn Addre&s;s to the great and ever-ble&s;&s;ed God,</HI> &amp;c. which is printed in the fourth volume of his works, and of which we &s;hall hereafter give a copy at length.</P>
<P>It has been confidently a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome Anti-trinitarians, that the Doctor before his death was come over to their party, and that he left &s;ome papers behind him, containing a recantation of his former &s;entiments, which his executors thought it mo&s;t prudent to &s;uppre&s;s. A report of this kind was lately revived, with the men|tion of &s;ome remarkable circum&s;tances in con|firmation of it, in the <HI>Monthly Review,</HI> of which we &s;hall take &s;ome di&s;tinct notice hereafter.</P>
<P>Some zealous patrons of the mo&s;t rigid ortho|doxy, unwilling to have &s;o eminent a divine as Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> numbered among the apo&s;tates from it, have zealou&s;ly maintained &s;uch reports as the above to be mere fictions; others have allowed that he might have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf unguarded|ly, and that he had adopted &s;ome modes of &s;peech incon&s;i&s;tent with his former views on the &s;ub|ject; but have endeavoured to exculpate him by urging the decay of his faculties, through age and inten&s;e application to &s;tudy. And others
<PB N="79" REF="025154_0077_0FCE72EDABBDE810">
have allowed that he had indeed for a time given into Anti-trinitarian &s;entiments, but that before his death he was happily recovered to the right faith. As a proof of the reality of his conver|&s;ion one Mr. <HI>Toplady,</HI> in a periodical publica|tion, was ra&s;h enough to print a Hymn of the Doctors on the Deity of Chri&s;t, which he fan|cied bore the evident marks of the infirmities of age. But unhappily for this writer the&s;e were in reality the infirmities of youth: for this Hymn was actually in&s;erted in the fir&s;t edition of the <HI>Lyric Poems,</HI> and by the author him&s;elf left out of the &s;ub&s;equent ones. This circum|&s;tance Dr. <HI>Gibbons</HI> has particularly mentioned, with a &s;evere and ju&s;t cen&s;ure of Mr. <HI>Toplady,</HI> both for his temerity in publi&s;hing this hymn as the production of the author's old age, and al&s;o for his groundle&s;s a&s;&s;ertions re&s;pecting the decay of his mental faculties.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Gibbons</HI> however has taken care to avoid &s;aying any thing which might lead to a di&s;cove|ry with reference to any alteration of Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s &s;entiments about the Trinity; which occa&s;ioned &s;ome unknown writer to addre&s;s to him a letter in the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Magazine,</HI> of which it may not be ami&s;s to in&s;ert a copy, which is as fol|lows.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>REV. SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your "Memoirs" of the truly great and excellent Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> you certainly did right in attempting to rectify any mi&s;takes into which
<PB N="80" REF="025154_0078_0FCE72BDABB0F790">
the Public had been led, concerning him or his writings, by any erroneous accounts i&s;&s;ued from the pens of ignorant or evil-de&s;igning men. I was glad to find that you had &s;o well refuted the idle &s;tories which have been &s;o generally report|ed and credited concerning the Doctor's "lo&s;s of his intellects" in the latter part of his life, and "his &s;trange chimeras of fancy," which a late Biographer (you &s;ay Mr. <HI>Toplady)</HI> hath retailed much to his di&s;advantage. I was al&s;o glad that you had expo&s;ed a palpable "mi&s;take" (if not pious fraud) of the &s;ame writer re&s;pecting a po|etical piece of the Doctor's "on the Sufferings and Glory of CHRIST," as one of the late&s;t of his compo&s;ures, p. 313.</P>
<P>But I am greatly &s;urpri&s;ed to find that you have pa&s;&s;ed over in total &s;ilence a matter of far greater moment than either of the&s;e, which the &s;ame writer mentions, with equal confidence, in the very &s;ame paper; and for the &s;ake of which alone this Poem is introduced. "He tells us, "that the Doctor had fallen into erroneous no|tions with re&s;pect to the Doctrine of the Trinity &mdash;but that GOD had mercy upon him before he left the world, and recovered him to the ortho|dox faith:" and as a proof of this he produces the above Hymn, which he &s;ays, "to the be&s;t of his knowledge, had never before appeared in print, and which &s;eems, from the unfini&s;hed &s;tate in which he left it, to have been one of the la&s;t products of his poetical pen."

Thus have you left the "Sabellians" to triumph, as having the mature judgment, the dying &s;enti|ments of the learned, the pious, the impartial <HI>Watts</HI> on their &s;ide; for his later publications &s;eem mo&s;t to favour the "Sabellian" &s;cheme.</P>

The Public have a right to a&s;k you, Sir, what was

It would not be a mere matter of "curio&s;ity" to know the la&s;t &s;entiments of &s;o great and good a man as Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> with regard to the Trinity; but it would have had a very important tenden|cy to a&s;&s;i&s;t others in forming their judgment on &s;uch a capital article of Chri&s;tian faith.

<P><PB N="84" REF="025154_0082_0FCE72C3359FDC08">To this letter the good Doctor did not think proper to give any an&s;wer. Nor has he, nor any one el&s;e, refuted the a&s;&s;ertions above referred to. From hence many will be inclined to give them credit.</P>
<P>But though it is undeniable that Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> did not continue in the &s;ame views of the &s;ubject which he entertained in the early part of his life, there is no deci&s;ive evidence that he materially altered his &s;entiments concerning the Trinitarian doctrine within any &s;hort &s;pace of his death, and it is highly improbable that he &s;hould. He had for many years made this point the &s;ubject of his laborious and impartial &s;tudy, and within about two years of his di&s;&s;olution he publi&s;hed the re|&s;ult of his enquiries, from which it is &s;carcely credible that he &s;hould in &s;o &s;hort a time have greatly deviated.</P>
<P>Dr. Watts died Nov. 25, 1748. His book entitled <HI>U&s;eful and Important Que&s;tions concerning Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Son of God,</HI> is dated 1746. And the &s;ame year (mo&s;t probably towards the clo&s;e of it) he printed another work, in which he fur|ther illu&s;trates and defends his opinion concern|ing the per&s;on of Chri&s;t, entitled <HI>The Glory of Chri&s;t as God-man di&s;play'd,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering how many years the Doctor had made this &s;ubject his &s;tudy, how deliberate he was in forming his &s;entiments, and how cautious he was of publi&s;hing them to the world, it &s;eems mo&s;t natural to look for his la&s;t &s;entiments on this much di&s;puted point in the&s;e two pieces; and the rather as the book which was written again&s;t him on the <HI>Arian</HI> &s;ide by Mr. <HI>Tomkins</HI>

<P>It is certain the&s;e pieces contain the la&s;t au|thentic account of his &s;entiments, as avowed by him&s;elf, and therefore till &s;ome deci&s;ive proof be brought of a &s;ub&s;equent recantation, the view which the&s;e books give of the matter, might ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as Dr. Watts's la&s;t thoughts on the &s;ubject of the Trinity.</P>
<P>From the&s;e it is abundantly evident that he had not given into the <HI>Arian</HI> or <HI>Socinian</HI> hypo|the&s;is, for he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;trongly again&s;t both, and maintains po&s;itions incon&s;i&s;tent with either. But it mu&s;t at the &s;ame time be allowed that he evidently appears to have deviated from the mo&s;t commonly received opinions, concern|ing the Son and Spirit of God, though he main|tained the true Divinity of both, which he did upon &s;uch grounds as he thought be&s;t &s;ecured every thing e&s;&s;ential to the doctrine and mo&s;t ef|fectually obviated the objections of its oppo|nents.</P>
<P>It is true, &s;ome both among the Orthodox and the Heterodox con&s;idered him as having in the&s;e publications given up the point; the former be|cau&s;e he differed from them in his manner of explaining it, and the latter becau&s;e he admitted the force of &s;ome of their objections to it, and freely gave up what he thought untenable, and

<P>It is &s;urpri&s;ing that they who lay &s;o much &s;tre&s;s upon candour, and are &s;o &s;evere again&s;t big|otry, &s;hould them&s;elves act &s;o uncandid a part.

<P>"He has one favour to beg of his readers, and that is, that they would not examine any of the&s;e papers by the mere dictates of their own rea&s;on|ing powers, for the &s;ubject is a mere matter of divine revelation; nor that they would take the &s;entiments or &s;chemes of elder or later writers, whether Schoolmen or Fathers, or Divines of any party, for a perfect te&s;t of truth and ortho|doxy in the&s;e &s;acred &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>"Yet he freely and delightfully confe&s;&s;es the&s;e following articles borrowed from the <HI>Athana&s;ian Creed,</HI> viz.
<Q>We believe and confe&s;s the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Son of GOD is both GOD and Man; GOD of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance with the Father, a Man of the &s;ub&s;tance of his mother,

<HI>born</HI> into the world, perfect GOD and perfect Man; of a rea&s;onable &s;oul, and human fle&s;h &s;ub&s;i&s;ting <HI>together:</HI> Equal to the Father as touching his Godhead, and yet inferior to the Father, as touching his manhood: One, not by conver&s;ion of the Godhead into the fle&s;h, but by taking of the manhood into GOD, <HI>&s;o as to become one per&s;onal agent or</HI> one per&s;on: and as the rea&s;onable &s;oul and fle&s;h is one man, &s;o GOD and man are one Chri&s;t, who &s;uffered for our &s;alvation,</Q>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>"Though I freely and cheerfully acknow|ledge all this, yet I take no human writings for a te&s;t of the divinity or truth of my opinions: And I could wi&s;h all my readers would lay a&s;ide all other teachers, be&s;ides the mere writers of the holy &s;criptures, in &s;uch enquiries, where the light of the&s;e divine truths will al&s;o &s;hine bright|e&s;t, which are not to be known by the mere light of nature, but are entirely to be learned by the revelation of GOD to his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to his holy apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>"And if this practice be &s;incerely pur&s;ued, the author humbly hopes the&s;e papers may find ac|ceptance among the diligent and hone&s;t enquir|ers after truth, &s;o far at lea&s;t as to have his un|willing mi&s;takes pitied and forgiven, and his &s;incere endeavours accepted, to make known the &s;criptures to his fellow-chri&s;tians in tho&s;e import|ant articles that relate to <HI>God the Father</HI> and his <HI>Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord,</HI> which are of &s;o much importance toward our &s;alvation.</P>
<P>"Yet finally to avoid all objections and dan|gers of mi&s;take, I think it may be proper here
<PB N="90" REF="025154_0088_0FCE72C9578360F0">
to take notice, that there have been generally two ways among our <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Divines allowed to explain the <HI>Filiation</HI> or Son&s;hip of our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, in his Divine nature; the one is, the real and &s;upernatural, which is granted to be ut|terly incomprehen&s;ible, relating chiefly to the <HI>nature</HI> of the Father and the Son; the other is &s;criptural and oeconomical, relating chiefly to their <HI>characters</HI> or <HI>offices</HI> in our &s;alvation, which is more ea&s;y to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t acknowledge I incline mo&s;t to the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> becau&s;e this allows the mo&s;t perfect equa|lity, even Onene&s;s or <HI>Samene&s;s</HI> in the Godhead, whether applied to the <HI>Father</HI> or the <HI>Son,</HI> and thus it maintains the true Godhead it&s;elf to be underived and &s;elf-exi&s;tent in both; and upon this &s;uppo&s;ition I believe the &s;econd of the&s;e writers have been always e&s;teemed perfectly &s;ound and orthodox as well as the fir&s;t."</P>

<P>The Doctor's <HI>Third</HI> que&s;tion (which leads to the di&s;covery of his opinion concerning the pre-exi&s;tence of the human &s;oul of Chri&s;t) is this,
<Q>Could the Son of GOD properly enter into a Covenant with his Father, to do and &s;uffer what was nece&s;&s;ary to our redemption, with|out a human &s;oul?</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is granted (&s;ays he) that the generality of our chri&s;tian writers believe that it was only the divine nature or Godhead of Chri&s;t which had an exi&s;tence before he was conceived of the Virgin Mary, and became incarnate; yet when|&s;oever they would repre&s;ent the exceeding great love of the Father in &s;ending his Son into our world, that he might &s;uffer and die for us, and de&s;cribe the tran&s;cendent love of Chri&s;t, in coming into the world and &s;ubmitting to death for our &s;akes, they u&s;ually repre&s;ent it in &s;uch language as can never agree with his <HI>Divine nature,</HI> in any propriety of &s;peech, but only to

the pre-exi&s;tent human &s;oul of Chri&s;t, with its de&s;cent into fle&s;h and blood, and the &s;uffer|ings of this human &s;oul for us. And it is evi|dent that the &s;cripture it&s;elf leads them plain|ly to &s;uch a repre&s;entation of things&mdash;&s;o that they are led by the force of truth into &s;uch ex|pre&s;&s;ions as are hardly con&s;i&s;tent with their own profe&s;&s;ed opinions.</Q>
He here quotes &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from Mr. <HI>Flavel</HI> and others, which &s;peak of the aba&s;ement of Chri&s;t, and the hu|miliating change which he pa&s;&s;ed through, which are totally inapplicable to Godhead.</P>
<P><Q>Now if we &s;uppo&s;e (&s;ays he) the human &s;oul of Chri&s;t to have a pre-exi&s;tent &s;tate of joy and glory with the Father before the world was created, the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are great and noble, are ju&s;t and true, and have a happy propriety in them to &s;et forth the tran&s;cendent love of the Father in &s;ending his Son, and of the Son of God in coming from heaven and leaving the joys and glories of his Father's immediate pre|&s;ence, to take on him fle&s;h and blood, and &s;uf|fer &s;hame, &s;orrow, pain, angui&s;h of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, &s;harp agonies and the pangs of death. And this love is exceedingly enhanced while we con&s;ider that this human &s;oul of Chri&s;t was per&s;onally united to the divine nature, &s;o that hereby GOD him&s;elf becomes manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But on the other hand, if we &s;uppo&s;e noth|ing but the <HI>pure divine nature</HI> of Chri&s;t to exi&s;t before his incarnation, then all the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions &s;eem to have very little ju&s;tice or propriety in them: for the divine nature of Chri&s;t (how

<P><Q>There is another and a very remarkable in|&s;tance, wherein our Prote&s;tant divines, in a very ju&s;t and affecting manner repre&s;ent the COVENANT of REDEMPTION, between the Father and the Son, according to &s;cripture, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of the pre-exi&s;tence of Chri&s;t's human &s;oul: But according to the common or &s;chola&s;tic explication of the doc|trine of Per&s;ons in the Trinity, we can have no ideas under all their glorious&punc; and affection|ate repre&s;entations of this tran&s;action.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="025154_0096_0FCE72D1EEB7DAA8">
<Q>The common or &s;chola&s;tic explication of the Trinity, which has been long and univer|&s;ally received and been called orthodox, is, That GOD is but one &s;imple, infinite and eter|nal Spirit: Hence it follows, that the divine e&s;&s;ence, powers, and e&s;&s;ential properties of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in the God|head are numerically the very &s;ame. That it is the &s;ame numerical con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, under|&s;tanding, will and power, which belongs to the Father, that al&s;o belongs to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: and that the &s;acred three are di&s;tingui&s;hed only by the &s;uperadded rela|tive properties of paternity, filiation and pre|ce&s;&s;ion; but their thoughts, ideas, volitions and agencies, according to this hypothe&s;is, mu&s;t be the very &s;ame numerical thoughts, &amp;c. in all the three.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctor then proceeds to give an extract from a &s;ermon of Mr. <HI>Flavel,</HI> which he highly approves, relating to the Covenant of Redemp|tion, in which he repre&s;ents
<Q>the per&s;ons tran&s;|acting with each other; the bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;act|ed, the quality of the tran&s;action as foederal; the Father promi&s;ing to &s;upport and reward the Son, the Son promi&s;ing to obey the Fa|ther's call to &s;uffer, &amp;c. and the articles to which they agree, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q>
He further ob|&s;erves, that the author repre&s;ents this tran&s;action in a way of <HI>Dialogue,</HI> and then remarks thus:
<Q>In reading &s;uch accounts of &s;tipulations and contract between the Father and the Son, be|fore the foundation of the world, what proper conceptions can we frame, or what clear ideas
<PB N="99" REF="025154_0097_0FCE730806F4BF18">
can we po&s;&s;ibly have, while we &s;uppo&s;e nothing but Chri&s;t's <HI>divine nature</HI> tran&s;acting this af|fair with the Father, and while we believe the divine e&s;&s;ence, perfections, and powers, the under&s;tanding, will, thought, and con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of the Father and the Son, to be numeri|cally one and the &s;ame? &s;ince in the Godhead they are but one and the &s;ame infinite &s;pirit? The mere per&s;onalities, paternity and filiation, can|not con&s;ult and tran&s;act in a way of contract, propo&s;al and con&s;ent: [which can only be done by] two di&s;tinct con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;&s;es and wills.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Further, one of the&s;e beings or per&s;ons cov|enanting, &s;eems to be inferior to the other, and to be capable of receiving orders, commi&s;&s;ion, &s;upport and recompen&s;e from the other: But if only the <HI>Deity</HI> of Chri&s;t exi&s;ted, and his De|ity and the Father's have but one numerical con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and volition, one power and glo|ry, what need of orders and commi&s;&s;ions, or of promi&s;es of &s;upport and recompen&s;e? How can pure Godhead be &s;upported or recompen|&s;ed?&mdash;What po&s;&s;ible difference can we con|ceive between the love of the Father in &s;ending the Son, and the love of the Son in con&s;ent|ing&mdash;And how doth this abate our grand ideas of the di&s;tinct and conde&s;cending love of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, in his con&s;ent to this covenant, &s;ince that part of him which really &s;uffered, i. e. his inferior nature, had then no exi&s;tence?</Q></P>
<P><Q>But on the other hand, if we give our&s;elves leave to conceive of the human &s;oul of Chri&s;t in its pre-exi&s;tent &s;tate, as the <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the fir&s;t form of every creature</HI> (Col. i.15. Rev. iii.14.)

<P>The <HI>Fourth Que&s;tion</HI> which the Doctor pro|po&s;es is this:
<Q>Is the Godhead of Chri&s;t, and the Godhead of the Father, one and the &s;ame?</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or, in other words, is the Deity of Chri&s;t, or the being to whom the humanity of Chri&s;t is united, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>the Father?</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>He an&s;wers in the affirmative, and proves it by the following arguments.
<Q>(1.) If the di|vine nature of Chri&s;t be another di&s;tinct prin|ciple of &s;elf-con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and volition, another di&s;tinct &s;piritual being, or another &s;pirit, this approaches &s;o near the doctrine of another GOD, that it is very hard to di&s;tingui&s;h it. For &s;o far as our ideas of arithmetic and rea&s;on can reach, this &s;eems to be a plain truth,&mdash;If one infinite &s;pirit be <HI>one God,</HI> two or three infinite &s;pirits mu&s;t be <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three Gods.</HI> (2.)

GOD of Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, the GOD of I&s;rael, the Almighty, Jehovah, is the pro|per &s;tyle and title by which GOD the Father was known under the Old Te&s;tament, and un|der the&s;e he often appeared to the Patriarchs; yet it is agreed by all Trinitarians, that it was Je&s;us Chri&s;t that appeared to them and a&s;&s;umed the&s;e titles. (3.) Several pa&s;&s;ages of the Old Te&s;tament cited by the writers of the New Te&s;tament, and applied to Chri&s;t, do evidently refer to the great <HI>one God,</HI> the GOD of I&s;rael, whom all before the days of Chri&s;t mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e to mean <HI>God the Father of all.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e texts are properly applied to Chri&s;t, if we &s;up|po&s;e the Godhead of the Father and of Chri&s;t to be <HI>the &s;ame,</HI> and THAT THE MAN CHRIST JESUS WAS THE SHEKINAH or HABITA|TION OF THE GREAT GOD, intimately and per&s;onally united to him.

On this &s;uppo&s;ition

I do not &s;ee how the Trinitarians can &s;olve the difficulties which ari&s;e from tho&s;e &s;criptures where GOD the Father is repre&s;ented as the <HI>only true God,</HI> and under that idea di&s;tingui&s;hed from Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>John</HI> xvii.3. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> viii.6. <HI>Eph.</HI> iv.5, 6. <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xliv.6, 8.xlv.21, 22.

<P><Q>On the whole, whatever unknown di&s;tinc|tions there may be in the divine nature, to lay a foundation for GOD'S di&s;covery of him&s;elf under three per&s;onal characters, as the Father, the Word, and the Holy Gho&s;t, yet the God|head of the Father &s;eems to be the &s;ame one infinite and eternal Spirit, which under &s;ome peculiar di&s;tinction or relation, is united to the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and hereby Je&s;us becomes one with GOD, &amp;c.

<P>As the pre-exi&s;tence of Chri&s;t's &s;pirit was the grand point which the Doctor laboured to e&s;tab|li&s;h, in order to avoid the difficulties of the com|mon &s;cheme, which either makes DEITY <HI>to &s;uffer,</HI> or makes the &s;uffering Saviour a <HI>mere man,</HI> and thus coincides with Sociniani&s;m, we &s;hall here pre&s;ent the reader with a view of the Doc|tor's manner of arguing to prove this point.</P>
<P>DISC. III. &sect;. 3. He fir&s;t argues <HI>from vari|ous con&s;iderations of &s;omething inferior to Godhead a&s;cribed to Je&s;us Chri&s;t before and at his Incarna|tion.</HI> e. g. I.
<Q>Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented as his Father's me&s;&s;enger, mini&s;ter or angel, that was a di&s;tinct being from his Father, &s;ent by him to perform &s;uch actions and &s;ervices for his people, long before his Incarnation, &s;ome of which &s;eem too low for the dignity of pure Godhead.</Q></P>
<P N="2">II.
<Q>Chri&s;t when he came into this world, is &s;aid to empty and dive&s;t him&s;elf of &s;ome glory which he had before his Incarnation. Now if nothing but his divine nature exi&s;ted before this time, this could not properly empty or di|ve&s;t it&s;elf of any glory; therefore it mu&s;t be his inferior nature, or his human &s;oul which did then exi&s;t.</Q>
Under this head the Doctor con&s;iders that much di&s;puted pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Phil.</HI> ii.

5&mdash;7. which he interprets thus.
<Q>Here the apo&s;tle's de&s;ign is to &s;et Chri&s;t forth as a pat|tern of humility; and this he doth by aggrandi|zing his former circum&s;tances, and repre&s;enting how he emptied him&s;elf of them, and appeared on earth in a very mean and low e&s;tate. <HI>Who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God,</HI> i. e. his human &s;oul, be|ing in union with his Godhead, was inve&s;ted with a God-like form and glory in all former ages; thus he oftentimes appeared to the Pa|triarchs as the Angel of the Lord, and as GOD, or Jehovah, clothed with the divine <HI>Shekinah,</HI> and &s;pake and acted like GOD him&s;elf. This &s;eems to be the <HI>form of God</HI> which the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of. Nor did he <HI>think it any robbery</HI> or pre&s;umption &s;o to do, <HI>i. e.</HI> to appear and act AS GOD, &s;ince he was united to the divine na|ture, and was in that &s;en&s;e <HI>one with God.</HI> Yet <HI>he emptied him&s;elf,</HI> i. e. he dive&s;ted him&s;elf of this God-like form or appearance, this divine <HI>Shekinah,</HI> and coming into the fle&s;h he con&s;ent|ed to be made <HI>in the likene&s;s of</HI> other <HI>men</HI>; nay, he took upon him <HI>the form of a &s;ervant,</HI> in|&s;tead of <HI>the form of God.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3">III.
<Q>That very being which came down from heaven, and was &s;ent of GOD into the world, is repre&s;ented as capable of having a will different from the will of GOD the Father, and therefore it mu&s;t be inferior to Godhead: now this could be no other but the will of his human &s;oul.</Q></P>
<P N="4">IV.
<Q>Chri&s;t repre&s;ents his own coming into the world, and being &s;ent either by the Father,

in &s;uch a manner as naturally leads one to &s;up|po&s;e he had a real and proper dwelling in an|other place, and in another manner, before he came into the world, and that he then changed his place and company, and manner of life; all which &s;eems more agreeable to a human &s;pirit than to a divine per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctor then, &sect; 4. mentions various <HI>mi&s;|cellaneous arguments to prove the &s;ame doctrine,</HI> e. g.</P>
<P N="1">I.
<Q>It &s;eems needful that the &s;oul of Chri&s;t &s;hould be pre-exi&s;tent, that it might have op|portunity to give its previous actual con&s;ent to the great and painful undertaking of atonement for our &s;ins. And indeed this voluntary con|&s;ent of his to become incarnate and to &s;uffer is plainly repre&s;ented in &s;everal places of &s;crip|ture.</Q>
<HI>P&s;.</HI> xl.6, 7. <HI>Heb.</HI> x.5, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">II.
<Q>The Covenant between GOD the Father and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the redemption of mankind, is repre&s;ented in &s;cripture as being made from or before the foundation of the world. [Mu&s;t we not then &s;uppo&s;e] that both parties &s;hould be pre&s;ent, and that this &s;hould not be tran&s;acted merely within the divine e&s;|&s;ence by &s;uch per&s;onalities as have no di&s;tinct mind and will&punc; The e&s;&s;ence of GOD is general|ly agreed to be but one con&s;cious mind or &s;pi|rit. Now can one &s;ingle under&s;tanding and will make &s;uch a covenant?</Q></P>
<P N="3">III.
<Q>Chri&s;t's coming into the world is al|ways expre&s;&s;ed in &s;ome corporeal language, &s;uch as denotes his taking on him animal na|ture, or body, or fle&s;h, without the lea&s;t men|tion of taking a &s;oul.</Q></P>

<Q>It is certain, that among the learned of the Jewi&s;h nation, there was a tradition of the pre-exi&s;tence of the &s;oul of the Me&s;&s;iah.</Q></P>
<P N="5">V.
<Q>Since it plea&s;ed the Father to prepare a body for our Lord Je&s;us, by the over&s;hadowing of the Holy Gho&s;t, and by a peculiar manner of conception, that he might be the Son of GOD in a &s;uperior &s;en&s;e, with regard to his <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> &s;o it is not unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>&s;oul</HI> of Chri&s;t al&s;o, which was to be united to Godhead, &s;hould have this peculiar prerogative, to be derived immediately from GOD, before any creature was made.</Q></P>
<P N="5">&sect; 5. Contains <HI>a confirmation of this doctrine by arguments drawn from the various advantages of it.</HI> After a full illu&s;tration of the&s;e, he &s;ums them up thus:
<Q>There are many dark and dif|ficult texts of &s;cripture which have puzzled interpreters in &s;everal ages, and which have hung heavy upon the various &s;chemes that &s;up|port the doctrine of the Deity of Chri&s;t. Now &s;uppo&s;e there could be one &s;ingle clue found out, which leads us into &s;uch a &s;olution of all the&s;e difficulties, and &s;uch an interpretation of the&s;e &s;criptures, which has the following ad|vantages attending it, <HI>viz.</HI>&mdash;Which gives the mo&s;t natural and obvious and literal &s;en&s;e, &s;o that every common reader that had no pre|conceived notions or &s;chemes of thought, would readily run into at the very hearing of it:&mdash;Which puts learned men to no trouble of figures and metaphors, &s;uch as <HI>Prolep&s;es,</HI> i. e. &s;peaking of things before they are done; or <HI>Catachre&s;es,</HI> i. e. calling the eternal GOD, with|out

Such is the doctrine of the pre-exi&s;t|ence of the human &s;oul of Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>From the foregoing extracts it is &s;ufficiently evident what Dr. Watts's &s;entiments were with|in a year or two of his death. The reader, how|ever, is not to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e publications were the effect of any &s;udden or recent change in his views of the&s;e doctrines; for it is well known, that he had many years before publicly avowed &s;ome peculiarity in his manner of conceiving and of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with re&s;pect to them, &s;o as
<PB N="112" REF="025154_0110_0FCE731F29491398">
to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the cen&s;ures of the more ri|gid Trinitarians as favouring here&s;y. In his <HI>Chri&s;tian Doctrine of the Trinity,</HI> printed &s;o early as the year 1722, he di&s;covered his inclination to the <HI>Indwelling Scheme,</HI> on account of which Mr. <HI>T. Bradbury,</HI> in a letter 1725, charged him with making
<Q>the Divinity of Chri&s;t to evapo|rate into a mere attribute,</Q>
and after jeering at his profe&s;&s;ed love of truth, writes to him thus:
<Q>It is pity after you have been more than thirty years a teacher of others, you are yet to learn the fir&s;t principles of the oracles of GOD. Was Dr. <HI>Owen</HI>'s church to be taught another Je&s;us? that the Son and Spirit were only two powers in the divine nature?</Q></P>
<P>The Doctor replied with equal gentlene&s;s and firmne&s;s, telling Mr. Bradbury, among other things,
<Q>That though the Doctrine of the Tri|nity be a fir&s;t principle, he never knew that the particular mode of explaining it was &s;uch a principle al&s;o.</Q>
With re&s;pect to the charge of de&s;troying a trinity of <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> the Doctor an|&s;wers thus.
<Q>I have often freely declared, and &s;till declare, that I allow the greate&s;t di&s;tinc|tion po&s;&s;ible between the &s;acred three in the divine nature, which does not ari&s;e to three di&s;|tinct con&s;cious minds or &s;pirits. Make it as great as you will &s;hort of this, and I acquie&s;ce. But then &s;ince three di&s;tinct con&s;cious minds is the true idea of three proper literal per&s;ons, what|ever falls &s;hort of this can be but an analogic|al per&s;onality; yet if any man will call this a proper divine per&s;onality, though it is but &s;imilar to human per&s;onality, I will not con|tend about words and names.</Q></P>

In the year 1721, he pub|li&s;hed his <HI>Sermons on various Subjects,</HI> in which there is one entitled, <HI>The Scale of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; or ble&s;&s;ed Saints, ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and ble&s;&s;ed Trinity.</HI> On the review of this di&s;cour&s;e in the year 1729, he &s;aw occa&s;ion to in&s;ert the following Note, (Edition 6th, vol. i. p. 260.)</P>

There appears to me good rea&s;on to doubt, whether there can be three di&s;tinct and differ|ent principles of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, and three di&s;|tinct and different wills in the One GOD, the one infinite Spirit. I was afraid to a&s;&s;ert it in this &s;ermon heretofore, and I am more afraid to a&s;&s;ert it now. Rea&s;on and &s;cripture join to teach me, that there can be but one GOD, and this GOD is a Spirit. What di&s;|tinctions

<P>From the above note it is plain, that Dr. Watts had in &s;ome re&s;pects altered his views of the &s;ubject. But &s;ome have taken occa&s;ion from thence to propagate an idea, that he had entirely given up the orthodox &s;aith; whereas nothing more can be ju&s;tly inferred from it, than that he had &s;omewhat altered his judgment with re|&s;pect to the manner of expre&s;&s;ing and maintain|ing it. Nor does it appear that he materially changed his &s;entiments afterwards. The more he enquired into the matter, the more he was confirmed in his opinion with re&s;pect to the mo&s;t perfect &s;implicity of the divine nature, or onene&s;s of the Godhead, and the pre-exi&s;tence of the derived nature of Chri&s;t, and at different times he wrote various E&s;&s;ays on the&s;e &s;ubjects, which he at length, in the two la&s;t years of his life, revi&s;ed and put together in the two publi|cations of which we have given an account. From the&s;e, as it is plain he was not an Athana|&s;ian, it is equally &s;o that he was not either an Arian or a Socinian. It is po&s;&s;ible however, though not probable, that he might change his

&s;entiments after the publication of the above pieces.

<P><Q>That the Doctor had altered his opinion with re&s;pect to &s;ome points of what is called <HI>Orthodoxy</HI> is undeniable. This is a &s;ubject that <HI>&s;ome</HI> of his encomia&s;ts &s;hrink from with concealed mortification, and would if po&s;&s;ible con&s;ign to oblivion, as it cannot be remember|ed without bringing &s;ome reflection either on the Doctor him&s;elf, or their own darling cau&s;e. But it would be in vain to deny a fact known to <HI>many</HI> who were intere&s;ted in making it pub|lic. It was well known to Dr. Lardner, and by him communicated to the late excellent Mr. <HI>Merrival,</HI> of <HI>Exeter,</HI> from who&s;e mouth the writer of the pre&s;ent article immediately received it. Dr. Watts's papers (many of which contained the mo&s;t explicit renuncia|tion of &s;ome of his former &s;entiments with re&s;pect to the doctrine of the Trinity) were mutilated, and publi&s;hed in a very imperfect manner. Some were <HI>wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed,</HI> and it was with difficulty that Dr. Doddridge could

The conduct of &s;ome of Dr. Watts's friends in this ca&s;e was &s;o di&s;ingenuous, that it called forth very loud complaints from tho&s;e who were acquainted with the &s;ecret: and it was but a &s;hort time before Dr. Doddridge embarked for Li&s;bon that he complained to Mr. Merrival of unfair conduct both with re&s;pect to Dr. Watts and him&s;elf, to who&s;e charge, in con|junction with the late Dr. David Jennings, his papers were entru&s;ted for publication.</Q></P>
<P>There is no rea&s;on to que&s;tion the veracity of the writer of the above article, nor of the autho|rities therein mentioned, but it is ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e that reports made at &s;o great a di&s;tance of time, and which had pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal hands, might undergo &s;ome material alterations. That Dr. Watts left &s;ome MSS. behind him to be publi&s;hed by Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI> and Dr. <HI>Jennings</HI> is not denied.

whole of what the&s;e gentlemen printed, except|ing "the Solemn Addre&s;s to the Deity," which it is not denied was printed entire. Some of his papers were indeed "&s;uppre&s;&s;ed," which related to the doctrine of the Trinity, but the charge of "di&s;ingenuity" in this matter is groundle&s;s, be|cau&s;e the Doctor had by no means enjo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned his executors to publi&s;h them, but left it to their own di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The publi&s;hers of his works made no &s;ecret of their having &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the&s;e papers, but &s;ay in the Title to his <HI>Addre&s;s to the Deity,</HI> which was prefixed to them,
<Q>that it was not judged ne|ce&s;&s;ary to publi&s;h them.</Q>
There is no proof that they contained a

a gentleman of veracity who had &s;een them a&s;&s;ured the writer of this, that they appeared to him to contain nothing new, being only a further illu&s;tration of his &s;enti|ments concerning the Trinity which he had be|fore publi&s;hed to the world, and therefore it might well be thought by his executors
<Q>un|nece&s;&s;ary to publi&s;h</Q>
any thing more upon the &s;ubject. That this was the real matter of fact appears to be highly credible, and indeed unde|niable, from the piece already referred to, which

it is &s;aid "Dr. Doddridge with great difficulty re&s;cued from de&s;truction."

Mu&s;t I not know thee, the only true GOD, and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> thy Son, whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent, that I may fulfil all my re&s;pective duties towards thy|&s;elf and thy Son, in hope of eternal life?

<P>"Holy Father, thou knowe&s;t, how firmly I believe, with all my &s;oul, what&s;oever thou ha&s;t plainly written and revealed in thy word. I be|lieve Thee to be the only true GOD, the &s;u|preme of beings, &s;elf-&s;ufficient for thine own exi&s;tence, and for all thy infinite affairs and tran&s;|actions among creatures. I believe thy only Son <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to be all-&s;ufficient for the glo|rious work of mediation between GOD and man, to which thou ha&s;t appointed him. I believe he is a man, in whom dwells all the fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily. I believe he is one with GOD; he is GOD manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h; and that the man <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is &s;o clo&s;ely and in&s;eparately united with the true and eternal Godhead, as to become one per&s;on, even as the &s;oul and body make one man. I believe that this illu&s;trious per&s;on is hereby po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of divine dignity, &s;uf|ficient to make full atonement for the &s;ins of men by his &s;ufferings and death, even though they be accounted an infinite evil; and that he hath all-&s;ufficient power to rai&s;e him&s;elf from the dead, to a&s;cend to heaven, and fulfil the ble&s;&s;ed works for which thou ha&s;t exalted him, and to govern and judge the world in thine ap|pointed time.</P>
<P>"I believe al&s;o thy ble&s;&s;ed Spirit hath almigh|ty power and influence to do all thy will, to in|&s;truct men effectually in divine truths, to change the hearts of fallen mankind from &s;in to holine&s;s,

I yield my&s;elf up joyfully and thank|fully to this method of thy &s;alvation, as it is re|vealed in thy go&s;pel. But I acknowledge my darkne&s;s &s;till. I want to have this wonderful doctrine of the all-&s;ufficience of thy Son and Spirit, for the&s;e divine works made a little plainer. May not thy humble creature be permitted to know what &s;hare they can have in thy deity? Is it a vain and &s;inful curio&s;ity to de&s;ire to have this article &s;et in &s;uch a light, as may not dimini&s;h the eternal glory of the unity of the true GOD, nor of the &s;upremacy of Thee the Father of all.</P>
<P>"Had&s;t thou informed me, gracious Father, in any place of thy word, that this divine doc|trine is not to be under&s;tood by men, and yet they were required to believe, I would have &s;ub|dued all my curio&s;ity to faith, and &s;ubmitted my wandering and doubtful imaginations, as far as it was po&s;&s;ible, to the holy and wi&s;e determinations of thy word.

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read with attention the view which you have given of Dr. WATTS la&s;t &s;entiments concerning the Doctrine of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Trinity, and think you have undeniably prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat the com|mon reports of certain per&s;ons, re&s;pecting his re|nunciation of the orthodox faith, are without foundation. But I mu&s;t take the liberty to &s;ay, that in the extracts which you have given from his two la&s;t publications, you have led your readers to entertain an idea that he was entirely in what has been called of late <HI>The Indwelling-Scheme</HI>; that he did not maintain a di&s;tinction of per&s;ons in the Godhead, but conceived of GOD, as being only one per&s;on, who is called the Fa|ther, and that it was this one per&s;on who dwelt in the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in con&s;equence of which union Chri&s;t is GOD. Whereas I think you mu&s;t have found, in examining his writings, that he did not deny a three-fold di&s;tinction in Deity, and that Chri&s;t had an exi&s;tence as GOD, previ|ous to the union of the human nature to the Godhead. For my own part, though I would by no means condemn you and others, who are
<PB N="128" REF="025154_0126_0FCE73492C8B03E0">
in the Indwelling-&s;cheme, as heretics, &s;ince you mean to &s;upport the Deity of Chri&s;t; and I think your &s;entiments widely different from Ariani&s;m or Sociniani&s;m; yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s to you that I do not believe this to be the &s;cripture repre&s;ent|atio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the doctrine. And, though I am clear|ly of opinion that our orthodox writers are not to be ju&s;tified, who &s;peak of the Father, Son, and Spirit as three per&s;ons &s;o di&s;tinct from each other as to be <HI>three beings</HI> (which I cannot vin|dicate from the charge of <HI>Trithei&s;m</HI>;) yet I do apprehend that there is a three-fold di&s;tinction in Deity, which ju&s;tifies the term <HI>three per&s;ons,</HI> and that to each of the&s;e the e&s;&s;ential attributes of Deity belong. Herein I cannot but think Dr. Watts's opinion coincided with my own, &s;o that he was more orthodox than your view of his &s;entiments would lead your authors to &s;up|po&s;e.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR AND WORTHY FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you for the freedom of your re|marks, and for the opportunity which you have afforded me of expre&s;&s;ing my ideas about Dr. Watts's &s;entiments, and propo&s;ing &s;ome queries to you concerning your own.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="025154_0127_0FCE734AAB1A39B8">I firmly believe that Dr. Watts was, in the latter part of his life at lea&s;t, in the &s;entiments which, upon the mo&s;t deliberate and impartial enquiry, I have embraced, re&s;pecting the Deity of Chri&s;t, &amp;c. called <HI>the Indwelling-&s;cheme.</HI> His idea &s;eems clearly to me to have been this: That GOD is one infinite being, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all per|fections: That this one GOD is he who is often characterized as the <HI>Father.</HI> That Je&s;us Chri&s;t is another being, or per&s;on, in him&s;elf inferior to the Father and derived from him; as you and all the orthodox will allow the man Chri&s;t to be:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Watts, in his &s;ermons printed 1721, has the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions:
<Q>The Son of GOD is &s;poken of in the New Te&s;tament as a very glori|ous per&s;on, who was &s;ome way begotten of the Father, i. e. <HI>derived</HI> from GOD the Father, Vol. II. p. 452. He is con&s;tituted near to GOD by an un&s;peakable union. What joys, what unknown delights po&s;&s;e&s;s the holy &s;oul of the man Je&s;us! for he is the neare&s;t <HI>creature</HI> to the ble&s;&s;ed GOD; for he is one with Godhead.</Q>
<BIBL>Vol. I. p. 250.</BIBL></NOTE> But that he exi&s;ted with the Father before all worlds; (which you, <HI>with the</HI> SOCINIANS, <HI>deny:</HI>) And that the one GOD, the Being call|ed the <HI>Father</HI> (with reference to Chri&s;t the <HI>Son</HI>) was &s;o united to him, and &s;o dwelt in him, that he became <HI>one with God,</HI> and in con&s;equence of this union he is properly GOD, &s;o that at his in|carnation GOD <HI>was manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, he does &s;ometimes allude to the idea of &s;ome <HI>unknown di&s;tinctions</HI> in Deity; but at mo&s;t, I conceive, he only means to &s;ay, he does not know what di&s;tinctions the incomprehen|&s;ible nature of Godhead may admit of; nor do I. But I cannot find that it was any article of his <HI>faith</HI> that there <HI>are</HI> &s;uch <HI>di&s;tinctions
<PB N="130" REF="025154_0128_0FCE734C5BE6CE98">
in the Godhead</HI> as you &s;peak of; on the contrary he maintains that the per&s;on, or being, united to the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, was not a <HI>part of Deity</HI> (for &s;o I mu&s;t conceive of it if it was not the <HI>whole Godhead</HI>) or an exi&s;tence &s;eparate from the <HI>Father,</HI> but that it was the <HI>Father him&s;elf.</HI> So that I cannot think that I have given a partial repre&s;entation of his &s;entiments.</P>
<P>And now, my good friend, as I am writing to you on this &s;ubject, I will embrace the oppor|tunity which you have afforded me for enquir|ing, <HI>What is meant by that three-fold di&s;tinction in Deity</HI> which you maintain? I have put this que&s;tion to many who u&s;e this phra&s;eology, but could never get a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. When I have propo&s;ed my difficulties, I have been told
<Q>the &s;ubject is my&s;terious, and I mu&s;t not pry too inqui&s;itively into the deep things of GOD.</Q>
Now I am willing to remain ignorant of what GOD has not thought fit to reveal. But &s;urely revealed truth, may be under&s;tood, and it cannot be pre&s;umptuous to &s;earch into the meaning of it. However, the enquiry in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e is not about the divine nature it&s;elf, but about a mere human form of &s;peech in re&s;pect to it. And is there any pre&s;umption in a&s;king a fellow creature, when he u&s;es language concerning GOD, which I do not under&s;tand, <HI>What he means by it?</HI> or in &s;tating the objections I have to it? With as much propriety might I charge <HI>him</HI> with pre|&s;umption in objecting to any phra&s;eology <HI>of mine,</HI> or de&s;iring of me an explication of it. Do you expect or wi&s;h me, good Sir, to adopt any modes of &s;peech, without having ideas to them? Is
<PB N="131" REF="025154_0129_0FCE734DE467A420">
this a &s;ufficient te&s;t of a per&s;on's being orthodox? I have always thought orthodoxy to &s;ignify, not <HI>&s;peaking,</HI> but <HI>thinking right.</HI> For any thing that appears, I think the &s;ame of GOD as you do. You &s;eem to maintain the <HI>Unity of God</HI> in as ab|&s;olute a &s;en&s;e as my&s;elf, ina&s;much as you deny GOD to be <HI>three beings.</HI> Wherein then do we differ? Were you to tell me freely what ideas you have when you talk of three di&s;tinctions in Godhead, po&s;&s;ibly it might appear that you be|lieve no more than I do, or I might readily fall into your &s;entiments. But till you tell me your <HI>meaning</HI> (which &s;urely you can do if you have any) I am incapable of making a compari&s;on between your &s;entiments and my own. At pre&s;ent, the mode of expre&s;&s;ion which you adopt appears to me highly exceptionable.</P>
<P>I can form no idea of a three-fold di&s;tinction in Deity but that of <HI>three beings,</HI> or three com|ponent <HI>parts,</HI> which is equally incon&s;i&s;tent with the unity, and would imply divi&s;ibility; which I am &s;ure you would prote&s;t again&s;t. I can ea&s;ily conceive of a di&s;tinction between the <HI>attributes</HI> of GOD. But do you make the Son and Spirit to be only di&s;tinct <HI>attributes?</HI> If &s;o, with what propriety can they be repre&s;ented, and addre&s;&s;ed, as <HI>per&s;ons?</HI> or how can they &s;u&s;tain different of|fices, and perform different works? or indeed <HI>any at all?</HI> Be&s;ides, if the attributes of GOD be allowed to be per&s;onified, it will follow that there are as many per&s;ons in GOD as there are attri|butes. If the Wi&s;dom of GOD be called one per&s;on, and his Power another, his Holine&s;s may be as ju&s;tly &s;tiled a third, his Goodne&s;s a fourth,
<PB N="132" REF="025154_0130_0FCE73525E3F1290">
&amp;c. The attributes of Deity are only the pro|perties of his nature. Neither of the&s;e can be properly called GOD, or &s;poken of as <HI>equal</HI> to GOD, who is <HI>the being</HI> to whom they all belong. Moreover, GOD him&s;elf you mu&s;t allow to be a <HI>being,</HI> and GOD the <HI>Father</HI> you will admit is a <HI>per&s;on,</HI> in the proper &s;en&s;e of that term, i. e. an intelligent being: but if the Son and Spirit are only attributes of GOD, then they are not equal to him, and con&s;equently this notion is contrary to the orthodox faith.

<HEAD>No. IV. Containing an account of <HI>Dr. Watts's Manu|&s;cripts,</HI> and an Ab&s;tract of a Corre&s;pond|ence between him and the <HI>Rev. Martin Tom|kins,</HI> on the Wor&s;hip of the Holy Spirit, and on Trinitarian Doxologies.</HEAD>
<P>IN the foregoing papers it was attempted to a&s;certain what were the la&s;t &s;entiments of the pious and amiable Dr. WATTS on the &s;ubject of the Trinity. I there endeavoured to prove that, though the Doctor had in &s;ome re&s;pects altered his manner of explaining that doctrine, he had by no means given up the doctrine it&s;elf; that the reports which had been circulated, con|cerning his explicit renunciation of his former &s;entiments, in the manu&s;cripts which he had left behind him for publication, were without found|ation, and that the conduct of his executors, which had been &s;everely reprehended, in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of tho&s;e papers, was fully vindicable.</P>
<P>Since the fir&s;t publication of the preceding work, fre&s;h evidence has ari&s;en on the &s;ubject, by which my former &s;uppo&s;ition is corroborated; and it appears to be &s;o full and deci&s;ive as to de|&s;erve to be now &s;ubjoined to this work.</P>
<P>In a collection of <HI>Letters to and from Dr. Doddridge,</HI> lately publi&s;hed by the Rev. <HI>Thomas Stedman,</HI> there are &s;everal written by the late Mr. <HI>Neal,</HI> an eminent Attorney, who was one of Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s executors. In one of the&s;e let|ters, written ju&s;t after the Doctor's death, dated
<PB N="135" REF="025154_0133_0FCE7356C7C8EB80">
November 29, 1748, is the following account of his Will and his MSS.&mdash;"As I know your high e&s;teem and veneration for Dr. Watts, who has taken his la&s;t farewel of the abodes of mor|tality,&mdash;I could not in friend&s;hip avoid writing you a line to inform you, that the Doctor has made his brother Enoch and my&s;elf executors of his Will" which bears date July 23, 1746, and contains the following clau&s;e:&mdash;
<Q>And as to my manu&s;cripts of every kind, I give the &s;ame to Mr. <HI>David Jennings</HI> and Dr. <HI>Philip Doddridge,</HI> in order that they may publi&s;h &s;uch of them, as I &s;hall by any paper or memorandum &s;igni|fy my de&s;ire &s;hould be publi&s;hed; and as to the remainder, either to publi&s;h or &s;uppre&s;s as they &s;hall judge be&s;t.</Q>
Mr. Neal adds&mdash;
<Q>I que&s;tion whether there are any left which he has ordered to be publi&s;hed.</Q></P>
<P>At the beginning of January following, Mr. <HI>Jennings</HI> wrote to Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI> on the &s;ame &s;ubject.&mdash;"I have waited from day to day in hope of being able to &s;end you a catalogue of Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s manu&s;cripts&mdash;but I find Mr. <HI>Neal</HI> does not chu&s;e to meddle with them ju&s;t at pre&s;|ent.

I believe we &s;hall not have near &s;o much trouble in publi&s;hing the Doctor's manu&s;cripts as I expected, when he acquainted me with his de&s;ign of committing them in part to my care, which was three or four years ago; for &s;ince then he has publi&s;hed mo&s;t of the MSS he de|&s;igned for the pre&s;s, &s;o that, as I learn from Mr. Parker,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Watts's Amanuen&s;is.</NOTE> there is little if any thing more remain|ing

<P>Mr. <HI>Jennings</HI> (who &s;oon after this received a Doctor's Diploma) adds the following pa&s;&s;age: "If I &s;hould be engaged in drawing up the Doctor's character, I am much obliged to you for the judicious hints you have furni&s;hed me with for that purpo&s;e." Mr. <HI>Jennings</HI> (who had preached and printed a funeral &s;ermon for Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> in which he had drawn a <HI>character</HI> of him) &s;eems here to mean, writing his <HI>Life</HI>; which it appears from another letter in this col|lection he declined, for want of &s;ufficient mate|rials.

<P>From this view of the contents of Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s MSS the impartial reader might be left to judge how far the reports, of the foregoing tract, are de&s;erving of credit. It may not, however, be ami&s;s to remark (1) that none of the&s;e papers were ordered to be publi&s;hed: (2) that there is nothing in the titles of any of them from whence it appears, with certainty, that the Doctor had materially altered his &s;enti|ments &s;ince the publication of his two la&s;t pieces, which was within two years of his death. (3) It does not appear that he had written any Treati&s;e &s;ince the time that he made his Will, which was in July, 1746. It may be further ob&s;erved&mdash; (4) if the Doctor had in any of his la&s;t papers made
<Q>an explicit renunciation of his former &s;entiments concerning the Trinity, &amp;c.</Q>
with which he was de&s;irous the public might be ac|quainted after his decea&s;e, it is incredible that he &s;hould not have left an expre&s;s order that &s;uch papers &s;hould be publi&s;hed; in which ca&s;e his friends, with whom he had entru&s;ted them, would doubtle&s;s have brought them to light.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="025154_0137_0FCE735FFB73C5B8">What became of his MSS does not appear. It is much to be wi&s;hed that they had been pre|&s;erved, for the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e who might de&s;ire to in&s;pect them, though they &s;hould not have been thought worthy of publication. The attentive reader, however, who is acquainted with the Doctor's other pieces, may ea&s;ily &s;up|po&s;e, from the foregoing view of his papers, and the phra&s;eology therein u&s;ed, that they contained much the &s;ame explanations of the Deity of Chri&s;t and the Spirit, with tho&s;e given in the pieces which he him&s;elf la&s;t publi&s;hed. The &s;um of which is, that Chri&s;t is a divine per&s;on in con&s;equence of the in-dwelling of the Father, and that the holy Spirit is GOD, as being the power, or active energy of the Deity.</P>
<P>That Dr. Watts was firmly in this la&s;t &s;enti|ment, and that on this ground he a&s;cribed glory to the Spirit, with the Father and the Son, at the end of his prayers, appears abundantly evi|dent, from a private crore&s;pondence carried on between him and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Martin Tomkins</HI>; of which I will, at pre&s;ent, content my&s;elf with giving a brief account, with a few extracts.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of the above tract, Mr. <HI>Tomkins</HI> frequently refers to Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s publications, and quotes the conce&s;&s;ions which he has made&mdash; viz.
<Q>that there is in &s;cripture no expre&s;s pre|cept for addre&s;&s;ing &s;uch wor&s;hip to the Spirit, nor any example of it, and that therefore this ought not to be con&s;idered as a nece&s;&s;ary part of chri&s;tian wor&s;hip; though he thought it lawful, becau&s;e the Spirit or Power of GOD is truly divine&punc; and expedient, becau&s;e the omi&s;&s;ion of Doxologies to the Spirit would be

highly offen&s;ive to &s;erious chri&s;tians who had been accu&s;tomed to them, and injurious to their edification.</Q>
Mr. <HI>Tomkins</HI> endeavours to prove,
<Q>that addre&s;&s;es to the Spirit, in prayer or prai&s;e, are unlawful and improper, chiefly becau&s;e we have no warrant for them in the holy &s;cripture, which is our only rule of wor|&s;hip, and that no other con&s;iderations ought to influence us to the practice.</Q>
He further endeavours to prove, that,
<Q>according to Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s avowed &s;entiment concerning the Spi|rit, as not a real per&s;on, but the power of the Father, a&s;criptions of prai&s;e to the Spirit are highly unju&s;tifiable.</Q></P>

<HEAD>Dr. <HI>WATTS</HI>'s Sentiments about the Holy Spirit.</HEAD>
<P>TO repeat in brief my &s;en&s;e of this matter, it &s;tands thus. The Spirit of any being, in &s;cripture-phra&s;e, is &s;ometimes u&s;ed for being it&s;elf, or it denotes its active and operative power. So an unclean or evil &s;pirit is the de|vil, Luke vii.21. Acts xix.15. Matt. x.1. and is called the &s;pirit of an unclean devil, Luke iv.33. So the Spirit of GOD &s;ometimes means GOD him&s;elf. And further, as the &s;pir|it of a man and the &s;pirit of a bea&s;t denote, in &s;cripture language, the principle of active pow|er in man and bea&s;t, why may not the Spirit of GOD have the &s;ame &s;ignification?</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="025154_0140_0FCE73672E9F16D0">
And though GOD the Father and his Spir|it be the &s;ame one true GOD, yet they are &s;ometimes di&s;tingui&s;hed and &s;ometimes joined.

<P>The Doctor having read to Mr. <HI>Tomkins</HI> his remarks, without giving him a copy of them, Mr. <HI>Tomkins</HI> wrote a reply at length, from his memory, which makes nearly two &s;heets of pa|per, in a &s;mall hand, which I have now before me. It is dated April 21, 1738. In this let|ter Mr. <HI>Tomkins,</HI> with great freedom and clear|ne&s;s, &s;tates his objections to what the Doctor had advanced in favour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f his practice in doxologiz|ing
<PB N="143" REF="025154_0141_0FCE7368AC5A33C8">
the Spirit, and endeavours to &s;hew, that his motive for it, upon which he lays &s;o much &s;tre&s;s, (viz. the avoiding of offence to many &s;erious chri&s;tians) was in&s;ufficient, and that by his con|duct in this matter, he led them to conceive of his &s;entiments concerning the Spirit to be differ|ent from what they were, and encouraged them in wor&s;hipping the Spirit as a real per&s;on di&s;tinct from the Father.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the letter Mr. <HI>Tomkins</HI> expre&s;|&s;es his mind with freedom about Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s Doxologies in his Book of Hymns. I &s;hall quote this pa&s;&s;age for the &s;ake of gratifying the reader with the Doctor's reply, which will &s;erve to il|lu&s;trate and confirm what I had before ob&s;erved, with re&s;pect to a report of the Doctor's having left a corrected copy of his Hymn-book, de&s;ign|ed for publication.
<Q>My chief aim (&s;ays Mr. <HI>Tomkins</HI>) in all I do upon this &s;ubject is, the re&s;toring the chri&s;tian wor&s;hip to its primitive purity, and freeing it from what I cannot but look upon as an unwarrantable innovation. And for this purpo&s;e I would make bold to proceed one &s;tep farther, and a&s;k, whether you now approve of what you have &s;aid concern|ing the <HI>Gloria Patri,</HI> in your Book of Hymns; and whether, upon your pre&s;ent notion of the Spirit, you can e&s;teem &s;ome of tho&s;e Doxolo|gies you have given us there, I will not &s;ay, <HI>as &s;ome of the noble&s;t parts of chri&s;tian wor&s;hip,</HI> [the Doctor's words] but as proper chri&s;tian wor&s;hip? And if not, whether you may not think it becoming you, as a lover of truth, and as a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter, to declare as much
<PB N="144" REF="025154_0142_0FCE736A4C84DD50">
to the world; and not &s;uffer &s;uch forms of wor&s;hip to be recommended by your name and authority, to the u&s;e of the chri&s;tian church in the pre&s;ent time and in future generations?</Q></P>
<P>In the margin of this long epi&s;tle of Mr. <HI>Tom|kins,</HI> are contained Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s remarks, which are upwards of twenty. Oppo&s;ite to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his la&s;t paragraph the Doctor writes thus:
<Q>I freely an&s;wer, I wi&s;h &s;ome things were corrected. But the que&s;tion with me is this: as I wrote them in &s;incerity at that time, is it not more for the edification of chri&s;tians, and the glory of GOD, to let them &s;tand, than to ruin the u&s;efulne&s;s of the whole book, by correcting them now, and perhaps bring further and fal&s;e &s;u&s;picions on my pre&s;ent opinions? Be&s;ides, I might tell you, that of all the books I have written, that particular copy is not mine. I &s;old it for a trifle to Mr. <HI>Lawrence</HI> near thir|ty years ago, and his po&s;terity make money of it to this day, and I can &s;carce claim a right to make any alteration in the book which would injure the &s;ale of it.</Q></P>
<P>It appears that Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> communicated to Mr. <HI>Tomkins</HI> his remarks upon his letter, which produced another from him, dated, <HI>Hackney,</HI> July 5, 1738, on which there is only this one marginal note of the Doctor's.
<Q>Mr. <HI>Tomkins</HI>'s confe&s;&s;ion of my Doxology to the H. S. to be lawful, yet not nece&s;&s;ary.</Q>
In this letter, which contains nearly a &s;heet in &s;mall writing, Mr. <HI>Tomkins,</HI> though he grants that the Doxo|logy which Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> u&s;ed, was not in it&s;elf unlawful, &s;trongly objects to the propriety of it,
<PB N="145" REF="025154_0143_0FCE736BAD022010">
and to the principle on which the Doctor plead|ed for it, that of complying with the prejudices of many &s;erious people.</P>
<P><Q>I do &s;till al&s;o differ from you as to the mat|ter of offence&mdash;nor can I recollect any thing in the practice or directions of the apo&s;tles that gives the lea&s;t countenance to &s;uch a proceed|ing.</Q>
With regard to the <HI>Gloria Patri,</HI> in the Doctor's Hymns, he adds,

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>ON a review of this publication &s;o far as it re|&s;pects Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s notion of the Trinity, (which I confe&s;s it was a leading object with me to bring forward) I can ea&s;ily imagine that &s;ome in|telligent readers will be di&s;&s;atisfied, and will think his &s;cheme liable to equal objections with other &s;chemes. I do not apprehend that it is incum|bent on me to defend it, nor am I &s;anguine in my opinion that it is the true one; though I confe&s;s that in the main it appears to me at pre&s;ent to be nearer the truth than that commonly received
<PB N="147" REF="025154_0145_0FCE737119FAE100">
as orthodox, which maintains three <HI>real per&s;ons,</HI> or di&s;tinct intelligent beings, in the Godhead. If I am mi&s;taken I &s;hould be truly glad to be better informed. <HI>Errare po&s;&s;um, Haereticus e&s;&s;e nolo.</HI> As I can have no intere&s;t to &s;erve in op|po&s;ing any article of &s;ound doctrine, neither have I any plea&s;ure in di&s;&s;enting from popular opin|ions, or modes of &s;peech. I am fully per&s;uaded, however, that the mode of explication here brought to view is not &s;o e&s;&s;entially different from &s;ome others which have been u&s;ual|ly allowed to be orthodox, as &s;ome per&s;ons ima|gine. All that I here intend is to offer a few ob&s;ervations in proof of this for the &s;atisfaction of &s;erious chri&s;tians, who have imbibed an early prejudice in favour of long e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tems, and certain human modes of &s;peech, and who may be alarmed under a &s;u&s;picion (which certain per&s;ons of better information have taken pains to promote) that my de&s;ign is, to promote <HI>Soci|niani&s;m</HI> or <HI>Ariani&s;m:</HI> terms of reproach which too many (and &s;ome without under&s;tanding their meaning) are ever ready to apply to &s;uch as ven|ture to think for them&s;elves, and to adopt lan|guage different from that which human creeds have &s;tamped as &s;acred, though the mo&s;t remote from the language of the Bible. If &s;uch will be attentive in reading, and candid in judging, I hope to convince them, whether they fall in with my mode of explanation or not, that I have <HI>done nothing again&s;t the truth, but for the truth.</HI></P>
<P>According to Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>'s view of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject&mdash;
<Q>The Father, the Word, and the Holy Gho&s;t, are the one living and true GOD.</Q>
To
<PB N="148" REF="025154_0146_0FCE73731C8EF190">
this propo&s;ition I give my ready a&s;&s;ent. And whoever does &s;o, whatever be his peculiar mode of explication, I will maintain has as ju&s;t a claim to the character of ORTHODOX, as they who do it in the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> &s;en&s;e. And for any, who adopt that or any other mode of explication, to monopolize ORTHODOXY to them&s;elves, is a degree of pre&s;umption unbecoming fallible creatures, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who allow that the MODE of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in the Sacred Three is not a&s;certained in &s;cripture; and, indeed, it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the avowed Catholici&s;m of the able&s;t and be&s;t writers who are the mo&s;t partial to the general Calvini&s;tic &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the idea of PERSONAL|ITY, as applicable to the Father, Son, and Spi|rit, Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> differed from many Trinitarians, as he denied (and I think with very &s;ufficient rea&s;on)
<Q>that there are in Deity three infinite Spirits, or really di&s;tinct per&s;ons, in the com|mon &s;en&s;e of that term, each having a di&s;tinct intelligence, volition, power, &amp;c.</Q>
Think|ing &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition incon&s;i&s;tent with the pro|per UNITY of the Godhead; which is doubt|le&s;s one of the mo&s;t obvious and fundamental doctrines of revelation.</P>
<P>But it is to be remembered, that with regard to the definition of <HI>per&s;onality,</HI> Trinitarians wide|ly differ among them&s;elves. While &s;ome &s;up|po&s;e it to be REAL, others think it only MODAL, or nominal, and others &s;omewhat between both. Some of the two latter cla&s;&s;es have charged the former with <HI>Trithei&s;m</HI>; and to me it &s;eems dif|ficult to clear the <HI>doctrine</HI> from the imputation.
<PB N="149" REF="025154_0147_0FCE737408B5E778">
Nor can I conceive what Trithei&s;m is, if this hypothe&s;is does not come under the de&s;cription. To a&s;&s;ert a mere UNITY of ESSENCE or NA|TURE will not obviate the difficulty: for three divine per&s;ons, or beings, though of the &s;ame nature, or in other words&mdash;all of them EXACT|LY ALIKE, (which &s;eems to be the meaning of the term, and is the popular idea) would be as really three GODS, as three human per&s;ons of the &s;ame nature, were they in all re&s;pects alike, would be three men. Such a &s;entiment, I think, ought to be zealou&s;ly oppo&s;ed as heretical.</P>
<P>I grant, however, &s;ince they who maintain this doctrine do not &s;ee the con&s;equence, but ut|terly di&s;claim it, and profe&s;s to believe in only ONE GOD, whom they wor&s;hip as one infinite being, through one mediator; it would be un|candid and unju&s;t to pronounce them <HI>Trithei&s;is,</HI> and in my idea it would be &s;chi&s;matical, for this rea&s;on alone, to &s;eparate from their wor&s;hip and communion. Many &s;uch, whom I have known, I venerate as the excellent of the earth. And whatever peculiar modes of &s;peech they may adopt <HI>in controver&s;y,</HI> their language, and apparent ideas, when engaged in divine <HI>wor&s;hip,</HI> are &s;uch, that in uniting with them I literally comply with the apo&s;tolic injunction, Rom. xv.6. <HI>With one mind and one mouth to glorify God, even the Fath|er of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But then on the &s;ame principles I mu&s;t cen|&s;ure tho&s;e Trinitarians as violating the laws of chri&s;tian candour, who upbraid &s;uch as hold the &s;ame general doctrine, with the oppo&s;ite here&s;y, and refu&s;e to hold communion with them, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="150" REF="025154_0148_0FCE737576C531C8">
on &s;uch a controverted matter as that of <HI>per&s;onality,</HI> they expre&s;s them&s;elves differently, and chu&s;e to adhere to the &s;implicity of &s;cripture language. This is particularly unbecoming in tho&s;e who adopt the <HI>modal &s;cheme,</HI> &s;ince the dif|ference between them and the followers of <HI>Watts</HI> can be but &s;mall.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e who think per&s;onality in the God|head to be <HI>&s;omewhat between a per&s;on and a mode,</HI> if there be any rational idea included in the term, they who con&s;ider
<Q>the <HI>manife&s;t Wi&s;dom,</HI> and the <HI>Active Energy</HI> of Deity, as the WORD and the HOLY GHOST,</Q>
may with good ap|pearance of rea&s;on be admitted as coming within the &s;ame de&s;cription.&mdash;And they who talk of <HI>three di&s;tinctions</HI> in Deity, without any definition of the term, have little rea&s;on to cen&s;ure &s;uch as in fact equally maintain three di&s;tinctions, but with a determinate meaning.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e who u&s;e the common Trinitarian language in the SABELLIAN &s;en&s;e (which upon a clo&s;e enquiry I have found to be the ca&s;e with &s;ome, and have rea&s;on to think it &s;o with many) they have little rea&s;on to cry out "here&s;y" at the mode of interpretation for which I am here apologizing.</P>
<P>That it &s;hould, by any, be &s;tigmatized with the name either of SOCINIANISM or ARIAN|ISM, appears to me peculiarly uncandid and unju&s;t. The <HI>Anti-Nicene</HI> Fathers evidently adopted this hypothe&s;is. And if I under&s;tand the great reformer <HI>Calvin</HI> aright, he in like man|ner conceived of the WORD and SPIRIT of GOD as the WISDOM and POWER of Deity

PERSONIFIED. The pious Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> adopt|ed a like per&s;onification, and &s;everely reproves tho&s;e orthodox men who anathematize them that e&s;pou&s;e &s;uch a mode of explaining the Trinity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Baxter</HI>'s works, vol. ii. p. 132. Where, though he &s;ays that he "accounts the doctrine of the Trinity the &s;um and kernel of the Chri&s;tian religion, and the <HI>Athana&s;ian Creed</HI> the be&s;t explication of it," he pleads "for the notion of "three e&s;&s;ential principles," and after illu&s;trating the matter by various objects in nature, he ob&s;ervs that "the &s;cripture often calls Chri&s;t the <HI>Wi&s;dom of God,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> (<HI>Logos</HI>) is both <HI>Ratio</HI> (rea&s;on) and <HI>Oratio</HI> (&s;peech). And that &s;ome think the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> given to be|lievers means <HI>Love to God,</HI> &amp;c. He then adds the following pa&s;&s;age:
<Q>Abundance of Heretics have troubled the church with their &s;elf-devi&s;ed opinions about the Trinity, and the per&s;on and nature of Chri&s;t. And I am loth to &s;ay, how much many of the <HI>orthodox</HI> have troubled it al&s;o, with their &s;elf-conceited, mi&s;guided, uncharitable zeal, again&s;t tho&s;e whom they judged Heretics.&mdash;I would advi&s;e the reader to be none of them that &s;hall charge with here&s;y all tho&s;e who &s;ay that the three per&s;ons are <HI>Deus &s;eip&s;um intelligens. Deus a &s;cip&s;o intellectus, et Deus a &s;eip&s;o amatus</HI> (tho I am not one) nor yet tho&s;e holy men whom I have ci|ted,&mdash;and many others, who expre&s;sly &s;ay, that <HI>Potentia, Sapientia, et Amor,</HI> (Power, Wi&s;dom, and Love) are the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t.</Q></NOTE> Certain it is that <HI>Socinians</HI> reject &s;uch kind of language, and di&s;avow the notion of a Trinity in any form; not now to &s;ay any thing of the <HI>atonement,</HI> which they univer&s;ally deny, but which tho&s;e I am defending as &s;trenuou&s;ly main|tain.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Arians,</HI> properly &s;o called, if I have any idea of their &s;entiments, they con&s;ider the <HI>Logos</HI> and the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> as CREATED BEINGS; which I think, with Dr. <HI>Watts,</HI> is an error, mo&s;t manife&s;tly repugnant to &s;cripture-doctrine.</P>
<P>It is true, Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> maintained the <HI>Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> to have been a created being. But if on that account his followers are ju&s;tly char|ged with here&s;y, I know not who will be ex|empt; for I &s;uppo&s;e all will allow that Chri&s;t was properly MAN, and as &s;uch created. Some,
<PB N="152" REF="025154_0150_0FCE737BCC20C838">
indeed, maintain that he was a human PERSON, as really as any other man is &s;o; and on this ground deny that his <HI>Divinity</HI> was a <HI>real per&s;on,</HI> di&s;tinct from that of the Father (for otherwi&s;e there would be TWO PERSONS in Chri&s;t;) while others &s;trangely and arbitrarily &s;uppo&s;e (to avoid this la&s;t ab&s;urdity) that the method of Chri&s;t was merely a created NATURE. But both allow
<Q>the Deity of Chri&s;t to con&s;i&s;t in the union of the Godhead, and the manhood, in the per&s;on of <HI>Emanuel,</HI> &s;o that in him <HI>GOD was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h.</HI></Q>
This general agreement I look up|on as all that is e&s;&s;ential to true orthodoxy, and a &s;ufficient bond of union. How much farther chri&s;tian charity may &s;afely extend, it is not my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire. I will only ob&s;erve, that they who have inve&s;tigated &s;ubjects of doc|trinal controver&s;y with the greate&s;t care and im|partiality, will be the mo&s;t ready to confe&s;s, that there are difficulties on all &s;ides, where the &s;crip|ture has not explicitly decided; and will &s;ee the greate&s;t rea&s;on for diffidence of them&s;elves, and candour towards one another. The&s;e are two principal le&s;&s;ons which I have learned from the &s;tudy of more than thirty years, and the&s;e I am principally &s;olicitous to inculcate upon others. If this publication &s;hould in any degree contri|bute to an&s;wer this end, I &s;hall be thankful, even though it &s;hould expo&s;e me to the cen&s;ures of &s;ome good men to who&s;e e&s;teem I am by no means indifferent, though their charity is much more confined than my own; and whom, what|ever they may think or &s;ay of me, I will love and honour.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE, CHARACTER, AND WRITINGS OF DR. <HI>PHILIP DODDRIDGE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE family from which Dr. Doddridge de&s;cended appears to have been originally &s;ettled in Devon&s;hire. No memoirs of it, however, are capable of being traced farther back than to his great grandfather, who&s;e name was Richard, and who was an eminent merchant at Barn&s;ta|ple, in that county. Of his great grandfather we are not told whether he was a gentleman who lived upon his e&s;tate, or whether he was of any particular profe&s;&s;ion. That the family was an|cient, is evinced by its arms; and that it was of &s;ome con&s;equence, is apparent from the liberal education, and the re&s;pectable &s;ituations, of &s;uch of the members of it as have not been con&s;igned
<PB N="154" REF="025154_0152_0FCE737E97978148">
to oblivion. John Doddridge, brother of the Doctor's great grandfather, was of no &s;mall di&s;|tinction in the law; pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal em|inent &s;tages of it, in the reign of King James the Fir&s;t; received the honour of knighthood; and at length ro&s;e to be one of the Judges of the Court of King's Bench. An account of him will be given below.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This John Doddridge, one of the &s;ons of the Richard Doddridge above mentioned, was born at Barn&s;taple, in the year 1555. In 1572 he was entered of Exeter College, Oxford, where he &s;tudied four years, after which he was removed to the Middle Temple, London, where he became a great proficient in the law, and a noted coun&s;ellor. In the forty-fifth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, he was Lent Reader of that hou&s;e; and on the twentieth of January 1603-4, he was called to the degree of Serjeant at Law. At the &s;ame time he had the honour of being appointed Serjeant to Henry Prince of Wales. From this employment he was rai&s;|ed, in the &s;ucceeding year, to be Sollicitor-General to the King; though his name does not occur, under that capacity, in Mr. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at&s;on's Political Index. On the twenty-fifth of June, 1607, he was con&s;tituted his Ma|je&s;ty's Principal Serjeant at Law, and was knighted on the fifth of July following. In February 1612-13, he was created Ma&s;ter of Arts, at his chambers in Serjeants' Inn, by the Vice Chancellor, the two Proctors, and five other members of the Univer&s;ity of Oxford. This peculiar honor was conferred upon him in gratitude for the great &s;ervice he had done to the Univer&s;ity, in &s;everal law-&s;uits depending between the city of Oxford and the &s;aid Univer&s;ity. On the twenty-&s;econd of April, 1613, Sir John Doddridge was appointed one of the Judges of the Court of King's Bench, in which office he continued till his death. In this &s;tation he appears to have conducted him&s;elf with great integrity as well as ability. How|ever, in April, 1628, he and the other Judges of the court were called upon to a&s;&s;ign their rea&s;ons in the Hou&s;e of Lords, for having given judg|ment again&s;t admitting five gentlemen to bail, who had been impri&s;oned for refu&s;ing the loan which had lately been demanded by the crown. Sir Nicholas Hyde, Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, Sir John Doddridge, Mr. Ju&s;tice Jones, and Mr. Ju&s;tice Whitlocke, each of them &s;poke upon the occa&s;ion, and made the be&s;t defence which the nature of the ca&s;e would admit. If they were guilty of a mi&s;take, which cannot now rea&s;onably be doubted, they &s;eem to have been led into it in the &s;incerity of their hearts, from the high notions they entertained of regal power. Sir John Doddridge, in his &s;peech, a&s;&s;erts the purity of his own character in the following terms:
<Q>It is no more fit for a Judge to decline to give an account of his doings, than for a Chri&s;tian of his faith. GOD knoweth I have endeavoured always to keep a good con&s;cience; for a troubled one who can bear? I have now &s;at in this court fifteen years, and I &s;hould know &s;omething. Surely, if I had gone in a mill &s;o long, du&s;t would cleave to my clothes. I am old, and have one foot in the grave; therefore I will look to the better part as near as I can. But <HI>omnia habere in memoria, et in nullo errare, divinum potius e&s;t quam humanum.</HI></Q>
Sir John Doddridge de|parted this life on the thirteenth day of September, 1628, in the &s;eventy-third year of his age, and was buried in the ambulatory before the door of the library formerly called Lady Mary's Chapel, in the cathedral church of Exeter. Within that library is a very &s;umptuous monument erected to his memory, containing his figure and that of his wife, cut in alaba&s;ter, under a &s;tately arch &s;upported by marble pillars. This learned Judge, by his happy education, accompanied with excellent natural parts and un|remitted indu&s;try, became &s;o general a &s;cholar, that it was &s;aid of him, that it was difficult to determine whether he were the better Arti&s;t, Divine, civil or common Lawyer. Among his other &s;tudies, he was a great lover of antiquities, and attained to &s;uch an eminence of knowledge and &s;kill in that department of literature, that he was regarded as one of the able&s;t members of the famous Society of Antiquaries, which may be &s;aid to have begun in 1571, but which more particularly flouri&s;hed from 1590 to 1614. The following works were written by Sir John Doddridge. 1. "The Lawyer's Light, or due Direction for the Study of the Law." London, 1629, quarto. 2. "A complete Par&s;on, or a De&s;cription of Advow&s;ons and Church Livings, delivered in &s;everal Readings, in an Inn of Chancery called the New Inn." Printed 1602, 1603, 1630, quarto. 3. "The Hi&s;tory of the Ancient and Modern E&s;tate of the Principality of Wales, Duchy of Cornwall, and Earldom of Che&s;ter." 1630, quarto. 4. "The Engli&s;h Lawyer, a Treati&s;e de&s;cribing a Method for the managing of the Laws of this Land, and expre&s;&s;ing the be&s;t Qualities requi&s;ite in the Student, Practi&s;er, Judges, &amp;c." London, 1631, quarto. 5. "Opinion touching the Antiquity, Power, Order, State, Manner, Per&s;ons, and Proceedings, of the High Courts of Parliament in England." London, 1658, octavo. 6. "A Treati&s;e of particular E&s;tates." London, 1677, duodecimo. Printed at the end of the fourth edition of William Noy's Works, entitled, "The Ground and Maxims of the Law." 7. "A true Repre&s;entation of fore-pa&s;&s;ed Parliaments to the View of the pre&s;ent Times and Po&s;terity." This &s;till remains in manu&s;cript. Sir John Dod|dridge al&s;o enlarged a book called the "Magazine of Honour;" Lon|don, 1642. The &s;ame book was afterwards publi&s;hed under his name by the Title of "The Law of Nobility and Peerage;" London, 1657, 1658, octavo. In the Collection of curious Di&s;cour&s;es written by eminent An|tiquaries, are two Di&s;&s;ertations by our Judge; one of which is on the Di|men&s;ions of the Land of England, and the other on the Office and Duty of Herald<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the country.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Collection of curious Di&s;cour&s;es written by eminent Antiquaries, Vol. II. p.</HI> 432, 433. <HI>Ibid.

<P>Daniel Doddridge, the Doctor's father, was brought up to trade, and &s;ettled as an oilman, in the city of London. Being the elde&s;t &s;ur|viving branch of the family, he was heir at law to the large e&s;tate of the Judge (about two thou|&s;and pounds a year) and was often urged by his friends to pur&s;ue the recovery of it, but he cho&s;e to decline doing it, from an apprehen&s;ion of the hazard and expen&s;e that would attend the at|tempt. He had a great number of children, all of whom died young, excepting one daughter, and our author. The Doctor was the la&s;t and twentieth child of his father's marriage. His mother was the daughter of the Reverend Mr. John Bauman, of Prague in Bohemia; who, in con&s;equence of the troubles which followed the expul&s;ion of Frederic, Elector Palatine, left his native country about the year 1626. Such was his adherence to the Prote&s;tant religion, that, for the &s;ake of enjoying the free exerci&s;e of it, he quitted all his friends, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a con&s;iderable e&s;tate. He withdrew, on foot, in the habit of a pea&s;ant, carrying with him nothing but a hundred broad pieces of gold, plaited in a leathern girdle, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Bauman, the fir&s;t night after he commenced his journey, left his girdle behind him at the inn in which he lay; and not being u&s;ed to &s;uch a cincture, he did not mi&s;s it till he came to another inn the next evening. Upon this he immediately went back to his former lodgings, with the united painful apprehen&s;ion of being met by pur&s;uers, and of not having the good fortune to recover his &s;ub&s;tance. When he arrived at the inn, he enquired of the chambermaid if &s;he had &s;een a girdle which he had left in his chamber. She informed him that &s;he had &s;een it, but that, imagin|ing it to be of no value, &s;he had thrown it away, and could not recol|lect where. After having told her that he had a great value for his old belt, that it would be very u&s;eful to him in the long journey he had be|fore him, and that he would hand&s;omely reward her for finding it, &s;he &s;earched diligently, and at length found it in a hole under the &s;tairs, where the family u&s;ed to throw their worn out u&s;ele&s;s furniture. The good man received his girdle with great joy, and pur&s;ued his journey with thankfulne&s;s to Providence for the recovery. This event he often &s;poke of to his friends, as an extraordinary and &s;ea&s;onable mercy.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Orton's Memoirs of the Life, Character, and Writings of the Rever|end Philip Doddridge, D.

Having &s;pent &s;ome time at Saxe-Gotha, and in other parts of Germany, he came to Eng|land, in what year is uncertain, with ample te&s;|timonials from many of the principal German divines. Being thus &s;trongly recommended, he was made Ma&s;ter of the Free School at King|&s;ton-upon-Thames, at which place he died, leav|ing behind him one only child, the daughter be|fore mentioned, then very young.</P>
<P>Dr. Philip Doddridge was born in London, on the twenty-&s;ixth of June, 1702. So de&s;ti|tute was he, at his birth, of the &s;igns of life, that he was thrown a&s;ide as dead. One, how|ever, of the attendants, thinking that &s;he per|ceived &s;ome motion or breath in him, cheri&s;hed with &s;uch a&s;&s;iduous care the almo&s;t expiring flame of exi&s;tence, that it was happily pre&s;erved, for the benefit of the world. From his infancy young Doddridge had an infirm con&s;titution, and a thin con&s;umptive habit, which rendered both him&s;elf and his friends apprehen&s;ive that his life would be &s;hort. He frequently was accu&s;tomed therefore, e&s;pecially on the returns of his birth|day,
<PB N="159" REF="025154_0157_0FCE738A83310058">
to expre&s;s his wonder and gratitude that his years were &s;o long continued. His parents, who&s;e character was worthy of their birth and education, brought him up in the early know|ledge of religion. Before he could read, his mother taught him the hi&s;tory of the Old and New Te&s;tament, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome Dutch tiles in the chimney of the room where they u&s;ually &s;at; and accompanied her in&s;tructions with &s;uch wi&s;e and pious reflections, as made &s;trong and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions upon his heart. His fir&s;t initiation in the learned languages was under Mr. Scott, a mini&s;ter, who kept a private &s;chool in London. In 1712, when he was ten years of age, he was removed to King&s;ton-upon-Thames, and placed at the &s;chool which had been taught by his grandfather Bauman. Here he continued till 1715, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf by his piety and his diligent application to literature. On the &s;eventeenth of July, in the &s;ame year, he had the unhappine&s;s of lo&s;ing his father; and he had been deprived of his mother &s;ometime before. This circum&s;tance, of his be|ing left an orphan, excited in him very &s;erious reflections, which, however, were not wholly of a gloomy nature; for he expre&s;&s;ed a devout, and even a cheerful tru&s;t in the protection of the GOD of Mercies, the univer&s;al Parent of man|kind.</P>
<P>About the time of his father's death, Mr. Doddridge quitted King&s;ton, and was removed to a private &s;chool at St. Alban's, under the care of a worthy and learned ma&s;ter, Mr. Nathaniel Wood. At this town he had not only the ad|vantage
<PB N="160" REF="025154_0158_0FCE738D3A9471D8">
of receiving excellent in&s;truction, but was peculiarly happy in forming an acquaintance with a gentleman to whom he owed the highe&s;t obligations, and who behaved to him with the kindne&s;s of a parent. The gentleman we &s;peak of was Mr. (afterwards Dr.) Samuel Clark, the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter of the place. What rendered Mr. Clark's regard and protection particularly &s;ea&s;onable, was a calamity that befell Mr. Dod|dridge with re&s;pect to his private fortune. By the mi&s;management of the per&s;on into who&s;e hands the care of his affairs had been entru&s;ted after his father's death, he lo&s;t the whole of his &s;ub&s;tance. In this melancholy &s;ituation, he found a ready benefactor in Mr. Clark; and had not Providence rai&s;ed him up &s;uch a generous friend, he could not have proceeded in the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies.</P>
<P>During Mr. Doddridge's re&s;idence at St. Al|ban's, he began to keep a diary of his life; from which it appears how diligently he improved his time, and how anxious he was to be daily advan|cing in knowledge, piety, virtue, and u&s;efulne&s;s. As he had the chri&s;tian mini&s;try in view, be&s;ides his application to the languages, he read, every morning and evening, portions of &s;cripture, with &s;ome commentary upon them; and it was very &s;eldom indeed, that he permitted either his &s;chool bu&s;ine&s;s, or any avocations or amu&s;ements, to divert him from this cour&s;e. He recorded the &s;ub&s;tance and de&s;ign of the &s;ermons he heard, to|gether with the impre&s;&s;ions which they made upon him, and particularly noted what was mo&s;t worthy of imitation in the preacher. In the&s;e

important concerns he had the &s;ingular felicity of enjoying the direction of &s;o kind and experi|enced a friend as Mr. Clark. Under the in&s;truc|tions, and by the encouragement of the &s;ame gentleman, he was admitted to the Lord's Sup|per; and his own reflections on the occa&s;ion, pre&s;erved in his diary, amply &s;hew the &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s of his &s;pirit in that early part of life:</P>
<P>In the year 1718, Mr. Doddridge left the &s;chool at St. Alban's, and retired for a time, to his &s;i&s;ter's hou&s;e,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His &s;i&s;ter was married to Mr. John Nettleton, a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter at Ongar, in E&s;&s;ex.

Her brother always behaved to her with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s; and even while at the academy, and in his fir&s;t &s;ettlement, generou&s;ly con|tributed all that he could &s;pare out of his &s;mall &s;tock for her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Orton, ubi &s;upra, p.</HI> 4. <HI>note.</HI></NOTE></NOTE> with a view of con&s;idering his future <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">fe&s;&s;ion.

Whil&s;t he was in this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence, the Duch|e&s;s of Bedford, who had a regard for his family, hearing of his &s;ituation and character, and of his warm inclination to &s;tudy, made him an offer, that, if he cho&s;e to be educated for the church of England, and would go to either of the Univer|&s;ities, &s;he would &s;upport the expen&s;es of his edu|cation, and afterwards provide for him, if &s;he &s;hould live, till he had taken orders. This pro|po&s;al he received with the highe&s;t gratitude, but declined it in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, as he could not &s;atisfy his con&s;cience in complying with the terms of mini&s;terial conformity. In
<PB N="162" REF="025154_0160_0FCE738FB07CB840">
the di&s;tre&s;s of his mind, from an apprehen&s;ion that he &s;hould not be able to accompli&s;h what was &s;o near to his heart, he waited upon Dr. Ed|mund Calamy, a divine of great eminence among the di&s;&s;enters at that period, and entreated his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards his being brought up for the mini&s;try. But in this application he met with no encouragement. The Doctor en|deavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from his de&s;ign, and urged him to betake him&s;elf to &s;ome other pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Di&s;heartened by &s;o many ob&s;tructions and difficulties, he at length entertained thoughts of entering upon the &s;tudy of the law, in which de&s;ign he was encouraged by Mr. Hor&s;eman, a celebrated conveyancer, who recommended him to Mr. Eyre, a coun&s;ellor, from whom he re|ceived &s;uch good propo&s;als, that he was on the point of complying with them. However, pre|viou&s;ly to his final determination, he devoted one morning &s;olemnly to &s;eek to GOD for direction; and whil&s;t he was actually engaged in this pious exerci&s;e, the po&s;tman knocked at the door with a letter from Mr. Clark, containing an offer to take him under his care, if he cho&s;e the mini&s;|try upon Chri&s;tian principles. With what thankfulne&s;s he embraced the offer, will appear from his own words in his diary. <Q>This, &s;ays he,

<P>Mr. Doddridge returned to St. Alban's, in con&s;equence of Mr. Clark's propo&s;al, and con|tinued &s;ome months at the hou&s;e of that gene|rous friend, who directed him in his &s;tudies, furni&s;hed him with proper books, and laboured to cheri&s;h religious di&s;po&s;itions and views in his heart. In October, 1719, he was placed under the tuition of the Reverend John Jennings, who kept an academy at Kibworth, in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, and was a gentleman of great learning, piety, and u&s;efulne&s;s. Mr. Jennings was the author of "Two Di&s;cour&s;es on Preaching Chri&s;t, and particular and experimental Preaching," fir&s;t printed in 1723, which were &s;o much e&s;teemed that they were recommended by two Bi&s;hops at their vi&s;itations of their clergy, and tran&s;lated in|to the German language, by order of Dr. Frank, Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity at Hall, in Saxony. A &s;e|cond edition of them appeared in 1736, under the care of Mr. Jennings's brother, Dr. David Jen|nings, who was for many years an eminent min|i&s;ter and tutor in London. Mr. John Jennings publi&s;hed likewi&s;e, "A genealogical table of the Kings of England, Scotland, and France, for the &s;pace of nine hundred years." Under the tuition of this gentleman, for whom Mr. Doddridge had the highe&s;t veneration and re&s;pect, he pro&s;ecuted his &s;tudies with the greate&s;t ardour and diligence. Be&s;ides attending and &s;tudying the academi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> lectures, and reading the particular parts of the authors to whom his tutor referred his pupils
<PB N="164" REF="025154_0162_0FCE7392A8C86A18">
for the farther illu&s;tration of the &s;ubjects treated upon, he had in one half year read &s;ixty books, and about as many more afterwards in the &s;ame proportion of time. Some of the&s;e were large volumes, &s;uch as Patrick's Commentaries, Til|lot&s;on's Works, and mo&s;t of the &s;ermons that had been preached at Boyle's Lecture. All the re&s;t were learned or u&s;eful treati&s;es. Nor was it in a ha&s;ty or de&s;ultory manner that the&s;e books were read by him, but with great attention and clo&s;e &s;tudy. Several of them he abridged; and from others he made extracts, which were in|&s;erted in his common-place book; and when he found, in any of the works peru&s;ed by him, a remarkable interpretation or illu&s;tration of a text of &s;cripture, he transferred it into his interleaved Te&s;tament or Bible.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, 12&mdash;14.</NOTE></P>
<P>It was of eminent advantage to Mr. Dod|dridge, that, during the whole of his academical cour&s;e, he enjoyed the corre&s;pondence of Mr. Clark. From &s;uch of this gentleman's letters as have &s;till been pre&s;erved, it appears that his advices to his young friend, whether regarding his religious or literary improvements, were &s;ig|nally wi&s;e and judicious.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letters to and from the Rev. Philip Doddridge, D. D. p. 1&mdash;14</NOTE> It was probably in conformity with the exhortations of Mr. Clark, that Mr. Doddridge made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to in|crea&s;e his acquaintance with cla&s;&s;ical learning. The more immediate objects of his attention were the Greek writers. The&s;e he not only read with care, but wrote ob&s;ervations upon them, for the il|lu&s;tration of the authors them&s;elves, or of the &s;crip|tures;
<PB N="165" REF="025154_0163_0FCE739640E17AA8">
and he &s;elected &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as might be &s;er|viceable to him in his preparations for the pul|pit. His remarks upon Homer, in particular, were &s;o numerous, that they would make a con|&s;iderable volume.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">4.</NOTE> This part of Mr. Dod|dridge's conduct is ju&s;tly entitled to commenda|tion. By forming his ta&s;te upon the great mo|dels of antiquity, to which he added an acquaint|ance with the polite writers of his own country, he acquired an ea&s;e and elegance of &s;tile which he would not otherwi&s;e have attained. His me|rit was the greater in this re&s;pect, as few of the di&s;&s;enters had hitherto cultivated the graces of compo&s;ition, and perhaps not many of them had excelled even in the per&s;picuity and correctne&s;s of their language. It is de&s;irable that the cau&s;e of truth, piety, and virtue, &s;hould come recom|mended with every po&s;&s;ible advantage.</P>
<P>While Mr. Doddridge was thus laying up a large &s;tore of &s;olid and ornamental knowledge, he was equally intent upon cultivating the ex|cellencies of the chri&s;tian character. For this purpo&s;e he drew up &s;ome rules for the regula|tion of his temper and conduct, which he in|&s;erted in the beginning of his interleaved New Te&s;tament, that, by a frequent review of them, they might have the greater influence on the whole of his behaviour. They are very &s;trict; and perhaps more &s;trict than can ordinarily and univer&s;ally be put into practice; but the effect of them was happy on him&s;elf, and an attention to them might be &s;ignally u&s;eful to others, who

have the &s;ame views in life.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They may be &s;een in Orton's Memoirs, p. 16&mdash; 18.</NOTE> In the year 1722, Mr. Jennings removed, with his pupils, from Kibworth to Hinckley, at which place Mr. Doddridge, after having been previou&s;ly examin|ed by a committee of mini&s;ters, and received an ample te&s;timonial to his qualifications, preached his fir&s;t &s;ermon. This was on the twenty-&s;econd of July in that year. As he was but lit|tle more than twenty years of age, his friend Mr. Clark &s;eemed rather apprehen&s;ive that he had be|gun to preach too &s;oon; but he acquie&s;ced in the judgment of his tutor, grounded on the ma|turity of Mr. Doddridge's abilities.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 20. Doddridge's Letters, p. 7.</NOTE> From his fir&s;t appearance in the pulpit, he was remarkably acceptable in the places where he exerci&s;ed his talents. After continuing to pur&s;ue his &s;tudies another year, he accepted of an invitation from the congregation of Di&s;&s;enters at Kibworth. At the &s;ame time he had an application from the city of Coventry, to be A&s;&s;i&s;tant to Mr. Warren. Mr. Clark gave the preference to the la&s;t offer, for &s;everal judicious rea&s;ons; notwith&s;tanding which, Mr. Doddridge, upon mature delibera|tion, made choice of the former &s;ituation. His principal motives for &s;o doing were his youth, and the opportunity of pur&s;uing his &s;tudies with little interruption. It was in June 1723, that he &s;ettled at Kibworth. As the congregation was &s;mall, and he lived in an ob&s;cure village, he could devote almo&s;t his whole time to the farther acqui&s;ition of knowledge and learning; and this he did with indefatigable zeal. Soon after his

&s;ettlement at Kibworth, one of his fellow-pupils having condoled with him, in a letter, on his being buried alive, he returned the following &s;en|&s;ible and &s;pirited an&s;wer:

It is with pe|culiar plea&s;ure that the writer of the pre&s;ent nar|rative has tran&s;cribed this pa&s;&s;age; as he thinks that he has rea&s;on to reflect, with &s;ome degree of &s;atisfaction, that the &s;pending of a number of
<PB N="168" REF="025154_0166_0FCE739AF5C818D0">
years in retired &s;ituations may be favourable to the increa&s;e of knowledge, and the habits of &s;tudy.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Mr. Doddridge lived at Kibworth, and during the earlier years of his mini&s;try, he was very exact and careful in his preparations for the pulpit. Both his &s;ermons and expo&s;itions were the re&s;ult of deep attention and &s;tudy; and they were drawn up with exactne&s;s of method, and correctne&s;s and elegance of &s;tile. By this means he contracted a habit of delivering his &s;en|timents u&s;ually with judgment, and always with ea&s;e and freedom of language, when, afterwards, he was obliged, from the multiplicity of his du|ties and engagements, principally to have re|cour&s;e to extempore &s;peaking. Indeed, except|ing when he was called out on particular occa|&s;ions, the period I have now &s;pecified was the time in which Mr. Doddridge more e&s;pecially excelled as a preacher. When I was a &s;tudent under him, he u&s;ed frequently, on a Saturday evening, to read in the academy, the &s;ermons he had made in his younger years; and they were much admired by his pupils, as containing mo|dels for their imitation, far &s;uperior to tho&s;e which he could then have lei&s;ure to give in his u&s;ual Sunday di&s;cour&s;es. One thing which plea|&s;ed mo&s;t of us was, that the&s;e &s;ermons had le&s;s of the Calvini&s;tical dre&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion than was adopted by him after his &s;ettlement at North|ampton.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the pains which Mr. Doddridge took to acquaint him&s;elf with con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ver&s;ial and criti|cal theology, he was in the continual habit of
<PB N="169" REF="025154_0167_0FCE739FE1E74688">
reading deeply and &s;eriou&s;ly the writers of prac|tical divinity. Among the&s;e, his peculiar fa|vorites were Tillot&s;on, Howe, and Baxter;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi, &s;upra, p. 22.</NOTE> and undoubtedly they are authors from whom the clergy of every denomination may derive the riche&s;t &s;tores of private improvement and public utility. I remember to have heard him &s;peak of Barrow with great energy of commendation. Many of the divines of the latter part of the la&s;t century (among whom the Church of England claims the larger number) were incomparably excellent for the high &s;pirit of devotion, the ful|ne&s;s of &s;entiment, and the energy and copiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;tile; and the neglect of them has been of no advantage to modern times.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of Mr. Doddridge's &s;erious pur|&s;uits, he did not di&s;continue his regard to polite literature. Having been early acquainted with the French tongue, he was frequent in the peru|&s;al of the elegant writers of that nation. He thought that many of them were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of very great genius, and he applauded them as in|timately acquainted with the ancients, tho&s;e prime ma&s;ters of eloquence and poetry. Of all their dramatic poets he met with none whom he admired &s;o much as Racine. He was charm|ed with the pomp, elegance, and harmony of his language, as well as with the maje&s;ty, tenderne&s;s, and propriety of his &s;entiments. His pieces, in general, for the &s;tage, he approved, as conducted with a wonderful mixture of grandeur and &s;im|plicity, which &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h him from the dulne&s;s of &s;ome tragedians, and the bomba&s;t
<PB N="170" REF="025154_0168_0FCE73A0EC64E9F8">
of others. Another of Mr. Doddridge's favour|ite authors was Fenelon, Archbi&s;hop of Cam|bray. That writer's Reflections upon Eloquence, in particular, he looked upon as one of the mo&s;t judicious performances he had ever &s;een. Mr. Doddridge was not equally an admirer of the French &s;ermons. The&s;e he judged to be far in|ferior to tho&s;e of our Engli&s;h divines. Bourda|loue's, notwith&s;tanding the high e&s;timation they have been held in, appeared to him to be little better than empty harangues. Many of Cham|inais' he e&s;teemed to be good; but of all which he had then &s;een, he gave the preference to the di&s;cour&s;es of Mr. Superville, the Prote&s;tant di|vine at Rotterdam. "He e&s;pecially excels," &s;aid Mr. Doddridge, in a letter to an ingenious young friend,
<Q>in the beauty of his imagery, de&s;criptions, and &s;imiles, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t pathetic expo&s;tulations I ever &s;aw. In &s;hort, I believe he is perfectly to your ta&s;te: only there is one thing which will di&s;plea&s;e you as much as it did me; which is, that many of his arguments are very inconclu&s;ive, though gen|erally as good as high Calvini&s;m will bear.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters to and from the Rev.

It is certain that Mr. Doddridge was afterwards particularly plea&s;ed with Saurin's &s;ermons, and &s;trongly recommended them to his pupils. Whether he was acquainted with Ma&s;&s;illon is not recollected.</P>
<P>While Mr. Doddridge was thus &s;olicitous to enrich his mind with various knowledge, and to qualify him&s;elf for appearing with every ad|vantage in the pulpit, he was diligently atten|tive
<PB N="171" REF="025154_0169_0FCE73A36ECAD220">
to the private duties of his &s;tation. He would often leave his &s;tudy, to vi&s;it and in&s;truct the people under his care. In his manner of conver&s;ation he was careful to adapt him&s;elf to the capacities of his congregation, which con&s;i&s;t|ed chiefly of per&s;ons in the lower ranks of life. This object, likewi&s;e, he &s;eriou&s;ly regarded in his public di&s;cour&s;es, which, while they were judi|cious, and frequently elegant, were, at the &s;ame time, plain and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood. In this happy art he was probably not a little a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his intimate acquaintance with the works of the excellent Tillot&s;on, which, however they may now be neglected by a fa&s;tidious age, will al|ways de&s;erve to be mentioned with honour, as having eminently contributed to the introduction of a rational and u&s;eful method of preaching in England. How anxious our young divine was, to di&s;charge every part of his duty as a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter, whether in or out of the pulpit, with the greate&s;t fidelity and zeal, is evident from the copious extracts which Mr. Orton has given from his diary.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 13&mdash;32.</NOTE></P>
<P>In October, 1725, Mr. Doddridge removed his abode to Market-Harborough, in doing which he did not di&s;continue his relation to the people at Kibworth. He preached to them as before, excepting on &s;acrament days, when his place was &s;upplied by Mr. Some of Harborough, who had taken upon him the pa&s;toral care of the &s;mall &s;ociety at Kibworth, in conjunction with his own. This change in Mr. Doddridge's re&s;i|dence was very advantageous to him, as it gave
<PB N="172" REF="025154_0170_0FCE73A4D4D75B90">
him an opportunity of nearer conver&s;e and inti|macy with a gentleman, to whom he had been under early obligations, and who, next to Mr. Clark, was, perhaps, the be&s;t friend he had ever experienced. Mr. Some was a per&s;on of uncom|mon piety, zeal, prudence, and &s;agacity. In|deed he appears to have been the prime ornament among the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters in that part of the kingdom. For the memory of this excellent man, who died on the twenty-ninth of May, 1737, Mr. Doddridge always maintained the mo&s;t affectionate regard, which he &s;trongly te&s;ti|fied on &s;everal occa&s;ions. He publi&s;hed, in par|ticular, &s;ome years after Mr. Some's decea&s;e, a judicious tract that had been written by him on the &s;ubject of inoculation, for the purpo&s;e of re|moving the religious difficulties with which ma|ny worthy minds had been embarra&s;&s;ed, in re&s;pect to that practice. In this view the pamphlet has been of very con&s;iderable utility. I do not find that Mr. Some ever printed more than two &s;er|mons; one in the year 1729, concerning the proper "Methods to be taken by Mini&s;ters for the Revival of Religion;" and another in 1736, preached at the funeral of the Reverend Thomas Saunders of Kettering.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi, &s;upra, p. 32, 33, 34.

<P>The abilities and talents of Mr. Doddridge occa&s;ioned him to be &s;ought for by much more numerous congregations than that in which he fir&s;t &s;ettled. Even &s;o early as in the year 1723, when he had but lately fini&s;hed his academical &s;tudies, he received an invitation to undertake
<PB N="173" REF="025154_0171_0FCE73A8C90D3AF0">
the pa&s;toral charge of a large &s;ociety of di&s;&s;ent|ers in the city of London. But he thought him&s;elf unequal to &s;o great a burden. Be&s;ides this, he was di&s;couraged by the unhappy differ|ences which at that time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the non-conformi&s;t mini&s;ters of the metropolis and its neighborhood, about &s;ub&s;cribing or not &s;ub|&s;cribing to articles of faith, in the words of human device, as a te&s;t of orthodoxy. In his an&s;wer to the gentleman who tran&s;mitted the invitation to him, he di&s;played the liberality of his own mind; for after mentioning &s;ome other objections to the propo&s;al, he added as follows:
<Q>I might al&s;o have been required to &s;ub&s;cribe; which I am re&s;olved never to do. We have no di&s;putes on that matter in the&s;e parts. A neighbouring gentleman once endeavoured to introduce a &s;ub&s;cription; but it was effectual|ly overruled by Mr. Some of Harborough, Mr. Norris of Welford, and Mr. Jennings, my tutor. I &s;hall content my&s;elf here, with being a benevolent well-wi&s;her to the intere&s;ts of liberty and peace.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ton, ubi &s;upra, p. 40&punc;</NOTE></P>
<P>In 1726-7, Mr. Doddridge was recommend|ed by his friend Mr. Clark to a vacant congre|gation at Hertford; the con&s;equence of which was, that two per&s;ons were &s;ent to Kibworth, to hear him. The re&s;ult of this matter, which &s;trongly di&s;plays the ridiculou&s;ly narrow &s;pirit of &s;ome of the di&s;&s;enters at that period, is thus hu|mourou&s;ly related by Mr. Clark in one of his letters.
<Q>Not having any other opportunity, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end you without
<PB N="174" REF="025154_0172_0FCE73A9F14F3EC8">
delay by the po&s;t, to complain of your keep|ing in your place of wor&s;hip &s;uch &s;tumbling-blocks and &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;toms, as are very offen&s;ive to your chri&s;tian brethren. It is no wonder you are thought a legal preacher, when you have the ten commandments paint|ed upon the walls of your chapel. Be&s;ides, you have a clerk, it &s;eems, &s;o impertinent as to &s;ay, <HI>Amen,</HI> with an audible voice. O tem|pora! O mores! that &s;uch a rag of popery &s;hould ever be tolerated in a congregation of Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters; and, to complete all, you, the mini&s;ter, conclude your prayers with a form called the Lord's prayer. Do you know what mi&s;chief you have done? What a blot you have brought upon your&s;elf by &s;uch offen&s;ive practices? It may be, you are &s;urpri&s;ed at what this means. In a few words then, Mr. Chandler of Bedford, being on his return home at Mr. Eccles's, de&s;ired him up|on my motion to write to Hertford, to re|commend you to them in his name, as a very fit man to be their mini&s;ter. Upon this, two members of that congregation went over the other day to hear you preach. But no &s;ooner did they come into the place, but they found them&s;elves di&s;appointed; and what they heard at the clo&s;e, confirmed them &s;o much in their prejudices, that they thought it needle&s;s to &s;ay any thing of their intention to you. Go|ing to preach la&s;t Sunday at Ware, I heard all this there, and afterwards at Hertford. I can|not but pity them for their weakne&s;s; and do not know but it is happy for you not to en|counter

&s;uch odd humours.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letters to and from the Rev.

However, it ought to be re|membered, that &s;ome of the di&s;&s;enters at Hert|ford had &s;en&s;e enough to be angry that two per|&s;ons &s;hould take upon them to judge for the whole &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Mr. Doddridge, in the year 1728, received a pre&s;&s;ing invitation from one of the di&s;&s;enting congregations at Nottingham, and a few months after, from the other. There were many cir|cum&s;tances that tended to recommend both the invitations. The &s;ocieties were large and re|&s;pectable, the &s;alary con&s;iderable, the town pop|ulous and flouri&s;hing, its &s;ituation delightful, the conver&s;ation agreeable, and the pro&s;pect of u&s;efulne&s;s very exten&s;ive. Neverthele&s;s, after mature deliberation, Mr. Doddridge determined to adhere to the plan of continuing to pur&s;ue his &s;chemes of improvement in a more private re&s;idence. In this determination he did not act without con&s;ulting his wi&s;e&s;t friends, and &s;eek|ing for divine direction. In 1729, he was cho|&s;en a&s;&s;i&s;tant to Mr. Some at Harborough; the congregation at that place being de&s;irous to en|joy his labours more frequently than before: the re&s;ult of which choice was, that he preached there and at Kibworth alternately. At this time of his life, though he was but little more than twenty-&s;even years of age, the fame of his abilities and worth was &s;o much &s;pread abroad, that his &s;ettlement among them was &s;ought for
<PB N="176" REF="025154_0174_0FCE73AD1F4226C8">
by various large &s;ocieties be&s;ides tho&s;e already mentioned. But his regard to Mr. Some, his love for the people at Kibworth, and his &s;olici|tude to have greater lei&s;ure for &s;tudy than he could enjoy in a populous town and exten&s;ive connections, &s;till retained their influence in lead|ing him to decline the different propo&s;als that were made to him for a removal.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi, &s;upra. p. 39&mdash; 41.</NOTE></P>
<P>When Mr. Doddridge left the academy, Mr. Jennings, a few weeks before his death, which happened in the prime of his days, on the eighth of July, 1723, earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed his pupil to keep in view the improvement of the cour&s;e he had gone through of academical lectures, and to &s;tu|dy that cour&s;e in &s;uch a manner as to refer what occurred to him, to the compendiums his tutor had drawn up, that they might be illu&s;trated and enriched. Our young divine did not then &s;u&s;|pect what was the motive of Mr. Jennings in giving him this advice. But he afterwards was informed, that his tutor had declared it to be his opinion, that if it &s;hould plea&s;e GOD to re|move him early in life, Mr. Doddridge was the mo&s;t likely of any of his pupils to pur&s;ue the &s;chemes which he had formed; and which, in|deed, were very far from being complete, as he died about eight years after he had undertaken the conduct of a theological academy. Agreea|bly to Mr. Jennings's advice, Mr. Doddridge, during his &s;ettlement at Kibworth, reviewed his cour&s;e of lectures with care. About this time, an ingenious young gentleman, Mr. Thomas Benyon, &s;on of Dr. Samuel Benyon, a celebrated
<PB N="177" REF="025154_0175_0FCE73AE6B3AFC70">
mini&s;ter and tutor at Shrew&s;bury, who died in 1708, had entertained thoughts of reviving the &s;cheme of his father. Conver&s;ing one day with Mr. Doddridge, the di&s;cour&s;e turned upon the be&s;t method of conducting the preparatory &s;tud|ies of youth intended for the mini&s;try. In con|clu&s;ion, Mr. Benyon earne&s;tly reque&s;ted of his friend, that he would write down his &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject. Mr. Doddridge con&s;ented, and drew up his thoughts in the form of a let|ter, which grew into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;iderable volume. But when he had ju&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the work, Mr. Benyon, for who&s;e u&s;e it was de&s;igned, died, and the treati&s;e remained in the writer's own hands. Mr. Saunders of Kettering, happening to &s;ee it in his &s;tudy, de&s;ired to have the peru&s;al of it; after which he &s;hewed it to Dr. Watts, with whom Mr. Doddridge had then no per&s;onal ac|quaintance. The Doctor, who was much plea|&s;ed with the plan, made &s;ome remarks upon it, and communicated it to &s;everal of his friends, who all concurred in opinion, that the per&s;on who had drawn it up was be&s;t qualified to carry it into execution. Accordingly, application was made to him for that purpo&s;e; and Mr. Some was the gentleman principally employed in ma|naging the affair. He knew that Mr. Dod|dridge had every important and de&s;irable qualifi|cation for the in&s;truction of youth; and there|fore he not only propo&s;ed his undertaking it, but pre&s;&s;ed the matter upon him in the &s;tronge&s;t terms. Nor would he by any means allow the validity of his plea of incapacity, but urged that, &s;uppo&s;ing him le&s;s capable than his friends be|lieved,
<PB N="178" REF="025154_0176_0FCE73B2466BFF48">
he might improve his time in his retire|ment, when engaged in &s;uch a work with a few pupils, to greater advantage than without them. This was a very proper con&s;ideration: for every man who has &s;u&s;tained the character of a pre|ceptor, if he has di&s;charged his duty with a &s;uit|able degree of attention and fidelity, mu&s;t be &s;en|&s;ible that the employment has highly contributed to the accuracy and increa&s;e of his own know|ledge. Mr. Some had likewi&s;e, unknown to Mr. Doddridge, obtained from the relations of &s;ome young men, the promi&s;e of putting them under his care, by which another objection that might have ari&s;en was precluded; and Mr. Saun|ders offered his brother to be the fir&s;t pupil of the intended academy. It was with great humi|lity and diffidence that Mr. Doddridge hearken|ed to the&s;e &s;olicitations. He was deeply con|vinced of the importance and difficulty of the undertaking, and devoutly implored the direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Supreme Being. Whil&s;t he was &s;till in doubt with regard to his final de|termination, he e&s;teemed it a kind providence that the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters in the neighbour|hood had agreed to meet at Lutterworth, on the tenth of April, 1729, to &s;pend a day in humilia|tion and prayer for the revival of religion. To this a&s;&s;embly Mr. Some propo&s;ed the &s;cheme that had been concerted for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an academy at Harborough, under the care of his young friend; and it met with the entire appro|bation of the gentlemen pre&s;ent. They unani|mou&s;ly concurred in their &s;entiments of the pro|priety and u&s;efulne&s;s of the de&s;ign, and Mr.
<PB N="179" REF="025154_0177_0FCE73B3AF2E8D60">
Doddridge's qualifications for conducting it; and they promi&s;ed him all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and encour|agement that were in their power. This had great weight in forming his re&s;olution. Never|thele&s;s, before the matter was ab&s;olutely deter|mined, he thought proper to con&s;ult &s;ome of his brethren and friends at a di&s;tance, and e&s;pecially Mr. Clark; who at fir&s;t he&s;itated on the &s;ub|ject, and, on account of Mr. Doddridge's admir|able talents for the pulpit, &s;eemed rather to wi&s;h that he might have a &s;ettlement in London. However, he &s;oon approved of the &s;cheme; as did the re&s;t of the per&s;ons who&s;e advice had been &s;olicited. Mr. Doddridge con&s;ented, therefore, to the execution of a plan which, on every &s;ide, was &s;o zealou&s;ly and earne&s;tly recommended. What much encouraged him to enter upon the office of an academical tutor, was the circum|&s;tance of his retreat at Harborough; the pa&s;to|ral care of the congregation there, and at Kib|worth, being fulfilled by Mr. Some; &s;o that he had little to do as a mini&s;ter, excepting to make one &s;ermon a week, which con&s;idering the vigour and celerity of his mind, was an ea&s;y ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Mr. Doddridge having, at length, re&s;olved to comply with the wi&s;hes of his friends, he imme|diately reviewed his plans of Academical Studies, with Dr. Watts's remarks, and corre&s;ponded with that eminent divine on the &s;ubject. He read, likewi&s;e, every valuable book which he could meet with on the education of youth, and made &s;uch extracts as he thought might be con|ducive to the execution of his de&s;ign. Be&s;ides this, he wrote many letters to the mini&s;ters of
<PB N="180" REF="025154_0178_0FCE73B52B088E48">
different denominations, with whom he was ac|quainted, reque&s;ting their advice in his great un|dertaking. One gentleman whom he particu|larly con&s;ulted was the Rev. Dr. Samuel Wright, of London, who favoured him with his &s;enti|ments at large, e&s;pecially on the head of divinity lectures. Mr. Clark communicated to him va|rious tran&s;cripts from the lectures of Mr. Jones, who had been a tutor of di&s;tingui&s;hed ability and learning, at Tewk&s;bury in Gloce&s;ter&s;hire. With all the&s;e preparations, Mr. Doddridge thought it his wi&s;dom to make a trial fir&s;t in a private way, with only two or three &s;tudents, declining to receive others that offered. At Mid&s;ummer, 1729, he opened his academy. The &s;ubject of his fir&s;t lecture to his pupils was of a religious kind, &s;hewing the nature, rea&s;onablene&s;s, and ad|vantages, of their acknowledging GOD in their &s;tudies. In the &s;econd, he gave directions for their behaviour to him, to each other, to the family, and all around them; with proper mo|tives to excite their attention to a right conduct in the&s;e re&s;pects. After this he proceeded to his ordinary cour&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 41&mdash;47. Doddridge's Letter p. 19, 20.</NOTE> Thus was he led to a &s;i|tuation of life which formed the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed &s;cene of his u&s;efulne&s;s. The late Rev. Hugh Farmer, &s;o well known among the di&s;|&s;enters as a mo&s;t excellent preacher, and by the literary world in general for his exten&s;ive learning and valuable publications, was one of Mr. Dod|dridge's earlie&s;t &s;tudents.</P>
<P>Our young tutor had been employed in his preceptorial capacity but a few months, when
<PB N="181" REF="025154_0179_0FCE73B926000318">
he was directed by Providence to a &s;ituation of greater u&s;efulne&s;s as a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter. There being a vacancy in the di&s;&s;enting congregation at Ca&s;tle-Hill, in Northampton, in con&s;equence of the removal of Mr. Tingey to London, Mr. Doddridge preached occa&s;ionally to them, as did others of his brethren. In doing this, his &s;er|vices were &s;o acceptable to the people, that he was invited and &s;trongly urged by them to be|come their pa&s;tor. Some of his friends, and par|ticularly Mr. Some, advi&s;ed his continuance at Harborough. The arguments alledged by them were, that he would have more time to apply to his work as a tutor, than if he had the &s;ole care of a large &s;ociety; and that there was another mini&s;ter, who, it was thought, might well &s;up|ply the vacancy, though, perhaps, not in every re&s;pect equally to the &s;atisfaction of the congre|gation. The&s;e con&s;iderations had &s;uch weight with him, that he determined to continue in his pre&s;ent &s;tation. In pur&s;uance of this view of the ca&s;e, Mr. Some went to Northampton, to per&s;uade the people to wave their application. But when he came there, and &s;aw their zeal and affection in the affair, and heard the motives by which they acted, and the circum&s;tances in which they &s;tood, he was, as he expre&s;&s;ed it, like Saul among the prophets, and immediately wrote to Mr. Doddridge to pre&s;s his acceptance of the invitation. The &s;ame thing was &s;trong|ly urged by his friend Mr. Clark. Still, how|ever, he was aver&s;e, on many accounts, to a change in his &s;ituation. But, being de&s;irous of te&s;tifying his gratitude and regard to the congre|gation,
<PB N="182" REF="025154_0180_0FCE73BAA39F1460">
he made them a vi&s;it, on purpo&s;e to ex|plain in per&s;on his rea&s;ons for declining their propo&s;al. Whil&s;t he was on this vi&s;it, &s;everal events occurred, which &s;trongly tended to pre|vail upon him to alter his re&s;olution. One or two of them, perhaps, may be deemed, by &s;ome of tho&s;e who may read Mr. Orton's account of them, to have a tincture of enthu&s;ia&s;tic weakne&s;s; but there was an argument pre&s;ented to him, which mu&s;t be allowed to have had very great weight. Before he returned to Harborough, the young per&s;ons of the &s;ociety came to him in a body; earne&s;tly entreated his &s;ettlement among them; and promi&s;ed to &s;ubmit to all &s;uch meth|ods of in&s;truction as he &s;hould think proper. This la&s;t circum&s;tance was the con&s;ideration that turned the &s;cales for his going to Northampton, after they had long hovered in uncertainty.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth of December, 1729, Mr. Doddridge removed, with his academy, from Harborough to Northampton, and in the &s;pace of two or three weeks commenced hou&s;ekeeping. This important change in his &s;ituation was not &s;uffered to pa&s;s without his entering into a &s;evere examination of his own mind, and forming the mo&s;t pious and &s;acred re&s;olutions with re&s;pect to his conduct, both as a ma&s;ter of a family and a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel. That he might be the better prepared for the large pa&s;toral work now devolved upon him, he employed part of the time between his &s;ettlement and his ordination in reading the be&s;t treati&s;es on the qualifications and duties of the mini&s;terial office. The books particularly &s;tudied by him were Chry&s;o&s;tom on
<PB N="183" REF="025154_0181_0FCE73BBF6D790E8">
the Prie&s;thood, Bowles's Pa&s;tor Evangelicus, Burnet on the Pa&s;toral Care, and Baxter's Gildas Salvianus. He read, likewi&s;e, the lives of &s;ome pious and active mini&s;ters, among which that of the Rev. Mr. Philip Henry afforded him much in&s;truction and encouragement. Be&s;ides this, he &s;elected, from the works which he peru&s;ed, the mo&s;t important advices, reflections, and mo|tives; and made a collection of tho&s;e maxims of prudence and di&s;cretion, an attention to which he thought would be calculated to &s;ecure e&s;teem and u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>About two months after Mr. Doddridge's &s;ettlement at Northampton, he was &s;eized with a dangerous illne&s;s, which gave many painful fears to his friends, le&s;t a life of &s;uch di&s;tin|gui&s;hed excellence, and &s;uch promi&s;ing utility, &s;hould be &s;peedily cut off. But, through a merciful Providence, he recovered from the di&s;|order, and, in due time, his health was complete|ly re&s;tored. While he was yet in a very weak &s;tate, the day arrived, which had been fixed up|on for his ordination; and it was a day to him of great &s;olemnity and importance, and which ex|erci&s;ed his mo&s;t devout meditations. This event took place on the nineteenth of March, 1729-30. It is but an act of ju&s;tice to record the names of the worthy mini&s;ters who were engaged in &s;etting apart for the pa&s;toral office &s;o eminent an in&s;tru|ment of &s;ervice to the church and the world. Mr. Goodrich of Oundle began with prayer and reading the &s;criptures. Mr. Daw&s;on of Hinck|ley prayed before &s;ermon. Then Mr. Wat&s;on of Leice&s;ter preached a di&s;cour&s;e from 1 Timo|thy

iii.1. "This is a true &s;aying, if a man de|&s;ire the office of a bi&s;hop, he de&s;ireth a good work." After this, the call of the church was read by Mr. Norris of Welford; and when Mr. Doddridge had declared his acceptance of it, he delivered his confe&s;&s;ion of faith, which was followed by what is u&s;ually called the ordination prayer. The charge to Mr. Doddridge was given by Mr. Clark of St. Alban's and the exhortation to the people by Mr. Saunders of Kettering; and the whole &s;olemnity was concluded with a prayer by Mr. Mattock of Daventry.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 47&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> It is rather &s;urpri&s;ing that we do not meet with the name of Mr. Some on this occa&s;ion. Some particular incident, now not known, perhaps a &s;udden illne&s;s, might have deprived Mr. Doddridge of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;o valuable and intimate a friend. That the cau&s;e &s;hould not have been mentioned by Mr. Orton in his Memoirs, or by Mr. Doddridge in his Diary, is an omi&s;&s;ion that could &s;carcely have been ex|pected.</P>
<P>It would carry us beyond the limits that mu&s;t be a&s;&s;igned to the pre&s;ent narrative, to de&s;cribe, at large, the diligence, zeal, and fervour, with which Mr. Doddridge di&s;charged his pa&s;toral duty. This matter is fully in&s;i&s;ted upon by Mr. Orton, to whom we mu&s;t refer for a more minute detail of particulars. However, we &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon a few leading circum&s;tances. Mr. Doddridge's fir&s;t care was to know the e&s;tate of his flock; for which purpo&s;e he made diligent enquiry into the members and &s;tated hearers of which it con&s;i&s;ted, and entered in a book their

names, families, places of abode, connections and characters. By this he was better enabled to adapt his vi&s;its and advices to their re&s;pective &s;ituations, and their religious improvement. With regard to the compo&s;ition of &s;ermons, his work as a tutor, and the pa&s;toral in&s;pection of a very numerous congregation, rendered it next to im|po&s;&s;ible that his di&s;cour&s;es for the pulpit &s;hould be &s;o exact and accurate as they were in the for|mer part of his mini&s;try. "Nor was it," &s;ays Mr. Orton,
<Q>needful. Having habituated him|&s;elf, for &s;everal years, to correct compo&s;itions, having laid up &s;uch a fund of knowledge, e&s;pecially of the &s;criptures, which was daily increa&s;ing by his &s;tudies and lectures, he &s;ome|times only wrote down the heads and leading thoughts of his &s;ermons, and the principal texts of &s;cripture he de&s;igned to introduce. But he was &s;o thoroughly ma&s;ter of his &s;ub|ject, and had &s;uch a ready utterance and &s;o warm a heart, that perhaps few mini&s;ters can compo&s;e better di&s;cour&s;es than he delivered from the&s;e &s;hort hints.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi, &s;upra, p. 57, 58.</NOTE> This encomium is, I think, to be admitted with &s;ome &s;light de|gree of abatement. The &s;ermons of Dr. Dod|dridge were different, as he was differently cir|cum&s;tanced. When he had lei&s;ure to draw out his plan, and the hints of what he propo&s;ed to &s;ay, to a con&s;iderable extent, his di&s;cour&s;es were often excellent in a high degree. But, at other times, when he could but ju&s;t lay down his &s;cheme, with only a very few thoughts under it, his &s;ermons, e&s;pecially if he was not in a full

flow of &s;pirits, were le&s;s valuable. Once, dur|ing my re&s;idence with him, a number of pupils complained, through the medium of Mr. Or|ton, that, though their revered tutor's academi|cal lectures were admirable, they had not in him a &s;ufficiently correct model of pulpit compo&s;i|tion. The con&s;equence of the information was, that his &s;ermons became far &s;uperior to what they had &s;ometimes formerly been; for he was the mo&s;t candid of all men to the voice of gentle admonition. When, however, he took the lea&s;t pains, he was always per&s;picuous in his method, and natural and orderly in the ar|rangement of his &s;entiments; and hence he furni&s;hed an example, from which many of the young men educated under him deriv|ed no &s;mall benefit in their future labours. I remember a remarkable in&s;tance of his power in extemporaneous &s;peaking. Aken&s;ide the poet, who in early life was &s;ettled, for a &s;hort time, at Northampton, being vi&s;ited by &s;ome relations from Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, who were di&s;&s;ent|ers, came with them, unexpectedly, one Sunday morning, to Dr. Doddridge's meeting. The &s;ub|ject he preached upon was a common orthodox topic, for which he had &s;carcely made any pre|paration. But he rou&s;ed his faculties on the occa&s;ion, and &s;poke with &s;uch energy, variety, and eloquence, as excited my warme&s;t admira|tion, and mu&s;t have impre&s;&s;ed Dr. Aken&s;ide with a high opinion of his abilities. The ingenious poet and the learned divine were in the habits of con&s;iderable intimacy while the former re&s;ided at Northampton. A matter of controver&s;y be|tween
<PB N="187" REF="025154_0185_0FCE73C5E7D38E80">
them was, how far the ancient heathen philo&s;ophers were acquainted with, and had in|culcated, the doctrine of immortality. Aken|&s;ide contended for the honour of the philo&s;o|phers, and Doddridge for that of the chri&s;tian revelation. The &s;ubject was pur&s;ued, in expre&s;s conferences, for two or three evenings; and both the gentlemen exerted their talents, and collected their literature on the different &s;ides of the que&s;tion. Dr. Doddridge, who loved to in|form his pupils of whatever he met with which he thought would contribute to their in&s;truction and plea&s;ure, related to us, on the &s;ucceeding mornings, the arguments that had been produ|ced, and the re&s;ult of the debate.</P>
<P>Without entering into a particular detail of many things which might be &s;aid of Dr. Dod|dridge as a preacher, I cannot help taking notice that he was always warm and affectionate in the applications of his &s;ermons. His &s;entiments on this head he has thus expre&s;&s;ed:
<Q>It is indeed unworthy the character of a man and a chri&s;|tian, to endeavour to tran&s;port men's pa&s;&s;ions, while the under&s;tanding is left uninformed, and the rea&s;on unconvinced. But, &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with a proper regard to this lead|ing power of our nature, I would &s;peak and write of divine truth with a holy fervency. Nor can I imagine that it would bode well to the intere&s;t of religion to endeavour to lay all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions a&s;leep, which &s;urely GOD im|planted in our hearts to &s;erve the religions as well as the civil life, and which, after all, will probably be employed to &s;ome very excellent

or very pernicious purpo&s;es.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 61.</NOTE> This is the language of wi&s;dom. True eloquence con&s;i&s;ts in an union of the rational, the forcible and the pathetic; and to addre&s;s to the affections as well as to the rea&s;on, of mankind, is the dictate of the &s;ounde&s;t philo&s;ophy. The cold and feeble con|clu&s;ions of many di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit, are as di&s;gu&s;ting to a ju&s;t ta&s;te, as they are un|profitable with regard to religious improvement.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be omitted, that Mr. Doddridge thought it a part of mini&s;terial prudence to take public notice of remarkable providential occur|rences. He endeavoured, in his &s;ermons, to de|duce le&s;&s;ons of wi&s;dom and piety from import|ant tran&s;actions, affecting the nation, town, or any con&s;iderable number of his hearers. Nor did he neglect uncommon appearances of nature, or other events, that were the &s;ubjects of gener|al conver&s;ation; to which may be added the &s;ea|&s;ons of the year, and e&s;pecially the mercies of harve&s;t. From an attention to the&s;e different circum&s;tances, his di&s;cour&s;es were accompanied with a greater extent of variety and u&s;efulne&s;s. He was a friend to funeral &s;ermons, which, if they be not too frequently exerci&s;ed or convert|ed to the purpo&s;es of adulation, con&s;titute an in&s;tructive and an affecting part of compo&s;itions for the pulpit. In his manner of &s;peaking he had an earne&s;tne&s;s and pathos which tended great|ly to affect his hearers. By &s;ome per&s;ons his pronunciation and action were judged to be too &s;trong and vehement; but to tho&s;e who were acquainted with the vivacity of his temper, and
<PB N="189" REF="025154_0187_0FCE73CB05E5E728">
his u&s;ual mode of conver&s;ation, it appeared quite natural and unaffected.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to his conduct, as a mini&s;ter, out of the pulpit, it mu&s;t &s;uffice briefly to ob|&s;erve, that he was very exact in the exerci&s;e of chri&s;tian di&s;cipline, and in &s;eparating tho&s;e from the church who were a reproach to their religious profe&s;&s;ion; that he had a deep concern and affectionate regard for the ri&s;ing generation; and that, in the mid&s;t of his numerous duties and engagements, it was matter of &s;urpri&s;e that he could &s;pare &s;o much time, as he did, for pa&s;|toral vi&s;its. It was a grief to him to find that the children of &s;ome of his hearers, through the ignorance and poverty of their parents, had nev|er been taught to read; and therefore he per|&s;uaded his people, in 1738, to concur with him in e&s;tabli&s;hing a charity &s;chool. In this bene|volent de&s;ign he met with &s;o much encourage|ment, that a foundation was laid for in&s;tructing and clothing twenty boys, who were put under the care of a pious and &s;kilful ma&s;ter. The Doctor him&s;elf often vi&s;ited the &s;chool and ex|amined and exhorted the children; accompany|ing his exhortations with affectionate prayers for their improvement and welfare. With &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities of the mind, and with &s;uch excellent virtues of the heart, it will not be deemed &s;urpri&s;ing that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a very high degree, the e&s;teem and love of his congre|gation. In his la&s;t will he bore this te&s;timony to their character,
<Q>That he had &s;pent the mo&s;t delightful hours of his life in a&s;&s;erting the devotions of as &s;erious, as grateful, and as de|&s;erving

Neverthele&s;s, he was not without his calls for the exerci&s;e of patience. There were per&s;ons belonging to his &s;ociety who were narrow bigots, and weak enthu&s;ia&s;ts; and the&s;e &s;ometimes entruded upon him in a fooli&s;h and trouble&s;ome manner.

<P>In 1730, Mr. Doddridge entered into the matrimonial relation with Mrs. Mercy Maris, a native of Worce&s;ter, and a lady in whom he found every qualification that could render mar|riage de&s;irable. She was, indeed, a religious, pru|dent and affectionate companion. Her con&s;titution was delicate, and her health, at times precari|ous, which often gave her hu&s;band no &s;mall cau&s;e of alarm; but &s;he was happily continued to him through his whole life, and &s;urvived him a great number of years.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">9.</NOTE> Of his affection and tenderne&s;s for her much might be &s;aid, were it nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge on the &s;ubject.

<P>Mr. Doddridge, in younger life, afforded va|rious proofs of a poetical turn, mo&s;t of which are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent biographer. The excellent lines which he wrote on the motto
<PB N="192" REF="025154_0190_0FCE3832E87A59B8">
to the arms of his family, "Dum vivimus vivamus," have appeared in &s;everal publications. Dr. John&s;on's opinion of the&s;e lines was, that they con&s;tituted one of the fine&s;t epigrams in the Engli&s;h language.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bo&s;well's Journal, p. 334.</NOTE> Though they are &s;o well known, they cannot be omitted in any me|moirs of the author's life.</P>
<L>"Live, while you live," the epicure would &s;ay,</L>
<L>"And &s;eize the plea&s;ures of the pre&s;ent day."</L>
<L>"Live, while you live," the &s;acred preacher cries,</L>
<L>"And give to GOD each moment as it flies."</L>
<L>Lord, in my views let both united be;</L>
<L>I live in plea&s;ure when I live to Thee.</L>
<P>Mr. Doddridge had a talent at &s;atyrical epi|grams; an in&s;tance of which is the following, written on one of his pupils, a weak young man, who thought that he had invented a me|thod of flying to the moon.</P>
<L>And will Volatio leave this world &s;o &s;oon,</L>

<L>'Twill &s;tand, however, in &s;ome little &s;tead</L>

<P>When Mr. Doddridge removed to Northamp|ton, his academy was only in its infancy; but it &s;oon grew into great reputation, and the number of &s;tudents increa&s;ed every year. In 1734, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to have a &s;tated a&s;&s;i&s;tant, to whom he a&s;&s;igned part of the ju|nior pupils, and the &s;uperintendence of the whole of them when he happened to be ab&s;ent.
<PB N="193" REF="025154_0191_0FCE73D3AA8B53B0">
He was &s;olicitous to maintain the reputation and e&s;teem of the gentlemen who &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;u&s;|tained this character, by his own behaviour to|wards them, and the re&s;pect which he required from the &s;tudents to them;
<Q>and they thought them&s;elves happy in his friend&s;hip, and the opportunities they had, by his conver&s;e, in|&s;tructions, and example, to improve them|&s;elves, while they were a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the educa|tion of others.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra.</NOTE></Q>
In the&s;e words, which are Mr. Orton's, he &s;poke from his own experi|ence; and every one who acted in the &s;ame ca|pacity might adopt &s;imilar language. Such of them as I have been acquainted with, were very re&s;pectable for their knowledge; and in the choice of them a particular regard was paid to their &s;kill in the Greek and Latin cla&s;&s;ics, as well as to their ability for in&s;tructing the young men in certain departments of mathematical and philo&s;ophical &s;cience. Among Dr. Doddridge's a&s;&s;i&s;tants, be&s;ides Mr. Orton, may be named the late Rev. Dr. Aikin, and the Rev. Mr. James Robert&s;on, who has been for many years Profe&s;|&s;or of Oriental Literature in the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh. Dr. Aikin was afterwards, fir&s;t, cla&s;&s;ical, and then theological tutor at Warring|ton; and perhaps, as a lecturer, he was never exceeded. This is the te&s;timony that has been uniformly given of him by all who had the ad|vantage of being his pupils. What he was as a parental in&s;tructor, will be judged of from the excellent and elegant productions of his &s;on and daughter, Dr. John Aikin and Mrs. Barbauld.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="025154_0192_0FCE73D4AE7F0F98">Since Dr. Doddridge's office as a tutor was the mo&s;t important &s;tation in which he appeared, it is an e&s;&s;ential part of a life written of him, to relate, &s;omewhat minutely, how he conducted him&s;elf in that capacity. He cho&s;e to have as many pupils as po&s;&s;ible in his own family, that they might be more immediately under his own eye and government; and latterly, he had a hou&s;e large and commodious enough to contain all of them, two or three excepted. The orders of the &s;eminary were &s;uch as &s;uited &s;tudents of a certain age; being a due medium between the rigour of &s;chool di&s;cipline and an unlimited in|dulgence. It was an e&s;tabli&s;hed law, that every pupil &s;hould ri&s;e at &s;ix o'clock in the &s;ummer, and at &s;even in the winter. Each young man, in his turn, &s;u&s;tained the weekly office of moni|tor, part of who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was to call up the re&s;t every morning; and they were to appear in the public room, &s;oon after the fixed hour. Tho&s;e who did not attend were &s;ubject to a pe|cuniary penalty; but if any repeatedly indulged to a habit of &s;loth, they were obliged to prepare an additional academical exerci&s;e. The puni&s;h|ment of the monitor's neglect, which I never re|collect to have happened, was a double fine. Their tutor &s;et them an example of diligence by being almo&s;t univer&s;ally pre&s;ent with them at the&s;e early ri&s;ings. After a prayer, which &s;el|dom la&s;ted more than two or three minutes, the young gentlemen retired to their re&s;pective clo|&s;ets till the time of family wor&s;hip. That &s;er|vice was begun by the Doctor with a &s;hort pe|tition for the divine pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing. Some
<PB N="195" REF="025154_0193_0FCE73D62FFF79C0">
of the &s;tudents then read a chapter of the Old Te&s;tament from Hebrew into Engli&s;h, which he critically expounded, and practically improv|ed. After this a p&s;alm was &s;ung, and he con|cluded with a longer prayer than at the begin|ning. On Sunday mornings &s;omething entirely devotional and practical was &s;ub&s;titued in the room of the u&s;ual expo&s;ition. In the evening the wor&s;hip was conducted in the &s;ame method, with only this difference; that a chapter of the New Te&s;tament was read by the pupils from Greek into Engli&s;h, and the &s;enior &s;tudents pray|ed in rotation. The Doctor, when pre&s;ent, which was generally the ca&s;e, expounded the New Te&s;tament in the &s;ame manner as he did the Old.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> It would give me plea&s;ure, if I could &s;ay, that &s;ome of the young men never &s;lily pla|ced an Engli&s;h Bible by the &s;ide of the Hebrew one. Such of the pupils as were boarded out of the hou&s;e were obliged to attend and take their parts in the dome&s;tic devotions; and tho&s;e, whe|ther in or out of the family, who were not pre|&s;ent, were &s;ubject to a fine, or, if their ab&s;ence was frequent, to public reprehen&s;ion. By the method which Dr. Doddridge pur&s;ued, the &s;tu|dents had an opportunity of hearing him ex|pound mo&s;t of the Old Te&s;tament, and the whole of the New, more than once. The more dili|gent among them took hints of what was deliv|ered. One piece of advice given them by the Doctor was, to get the Old Te&s;tament, and Wet&s;tein's Greek Te&s;tament interleaved, in quar|to, in order to write in them the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able

remarks for the illu&s;tration of the &s;crip|tures, which either occurred in their tutor's ex|po&s;itions, or were derived from their own read|ing, conver&s;ation, and reflections.</P>
<P>Soon after breakfa&s;t, Dr. Doddridge proceed|ed to the di&s;charge of his academical duty. The &s;everal cla&s;&s;es were taken by him in their proper order, and he lectured to each of them about the &s;pace of an hour. His a&s;&s;i&s;tant was at the &s;ame time engaged in a &s;imilar manner. Rich's &s;hort|hand was one of the fir&s;t things which he ex|pected his pupils to learn, that he might be able to tran&s;cribe his own lectures, and make extracts from the books they read and con&s;ulted, with greater ea&s;e and celerity. Indeed, this was a cir|cum&s;tance from which they might derive great advantage in future life, as the experience of the pre&s;ent writer can te&s;tify. Care was taken, in the fir&s;t year of the young men's cour&s;e, that they &s;hould retain and improve that knowledge of Greek and Latin which they had acquired at &s;chool. With regard to the Hebrew language, they were either initiated into it, or, if they had learned it before, were carried on to greater im|provement. U&s;ually the attention to cla&s;&s;ical literature was extended through the &s;econd year of the cour&s;e. Of late, the di&s;&s;enting academies have exerted a far &s;uperior zeal with re&s;pect to this very important object. Whil&s;t I was one of the tutors at Hoxton, cla&s;&s;ical in&s;truction was continued at lea&s;t for three years; and at the new college, Hackney, it makes a part of the whole cour&s;e. Be&s;ides what was done in a morning, the Greek and Latin lectures, at Dr. Dod|dridge's,
<PB N="197" REF="025154_0195_0FCE73DB99B2F2F0">
were read every evening, u&s;ually by the a&s;&s;i&s;tant, though &s;ometimes by him&s;elf. If any of the pupils were deficient in the knowledge of the Greek, &s;uch of the &s;eniors as were &s;killed in that language were appointed to be their in|&s;tructors, at &s;eparate hours. Tho&s;e who cho&s;e it were taught the French tongue. The longer Dr. Doddridge lived, the more was he convin|ced of the great importance of a learned, as well as a pious education, for the chri&s;tian mini&s;try. Having found that &s;ome who came under his care were not competently acquainted with the cla&s;&s;ics, he formed a &s;cheme for a&s;&s;i&s;ting youths, of a promi&s;ing genius and a &s;erious temper, in their preparations for academical &s;tudies; and he met with good encouragement in the &s;cheme from the contributions of many of his friends. As it commenced only two years before his death, much progre&s;s could not be made in it; but a &s;imilar plan has &s;ince been adopted by Mr. Coward's tru&s;tees, with &s;ingular utility. Dr. Doddridge was not, in every in&s;tance, &s;o at|tentive to the cla&s;&s;ical preparation of the &s;tudents received into his &s;eminary, as could have been wi&s;hed. Sometimes he admitted &s;erious young men, of perhaps three or four and twenty years of age, who had had very little of that prepara|tion, and who never di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, in this re&s;pect, by their &s;ub&s;equent improvement. He thought, however, that they might be u&s;e|ful in plain country congregations; which was undoubtedly the ca&s;e.

Doctor, I believe, towards the clo&s;e of his life, was of opinion that he had gone far enough in this matter.</P>
<P>Other things which were read to the &s;tu|dents, during the fir&s;t year of their cour&s;e, were &s;y&s;tems of logic, rhetoric, geography, and meta|phy&s;ics. The logic was Dr. Watts's, which was very fully pur&s;ued. On rhetoric the lec|tures were &s;lender and imperfect, being only a &s;light enlargement of a &s;mall compendium that had been drawn up by Mr. Jennings. Geogra|phy was better taught; but of metaphy&s;ics there was only given at this time a brief epitome, as the great objects it pre&s;ents were afterwards more amply con&s;idered. Under the&s;e &s;everal heads the pupils were referred to particular pa&s;&s;ages in &s;uch authors as treated upon them. This part of the cour&s;e was accompanied with lectures on the principles of geometry and algebra, which, be&s;ides their intrin&s;ic excellence, were happily calculated to form in the young men a fixedne&s;s of attention, and a habit of rightly di&s;crimina|ting, and properly arranging their conceptions. When the&s;e branches of &s;cience were fini&s;hed, the &s;tudents were introduced to the knowledge of trigonometry, conic-&s;ections, and cele&s;tial mechanics; under which la&s;t term was included a collection of important propo&s;itions, taken chiefly from Sir I&s;aac Newton, and relating e&s;|pecially, though not &s;olely, centripetal and cen|trifugal forces. A &s;y&s;tem of natural and expe|rimental philo&s;ophy, comprehending mechan|ics, &s;tatics, hydro&s;tatics, optics, pneumatics, and a&s;tronomy, was likewi&s;e read, with refer|ences
<PB N="199" REF="025154_0197_0FCE73DE6C0666A8">
to the be&s;t authors on the&s;e &s;ubjects. Mu&s;chenbroek was made u&s;e of in my time as a text book, and afterwards Rowning. For the particular objects to which they relate, recour&s;e was had to Clarc on Fluids, and Keill's A&s;tronomy. The &s;y&s;tem of na|tural philo&s;ophy was illu&s;trated by a neat and pretty large apparatus. As the pupils pro|ceeded in their cour&s;e, &s;ome other articles were al&s;o touched upon. Mr. Orton mentions par|ticularly natural and civil hi&s;tory; but the&s;e two objects do not fall under my recollection. At mo&s;t, they were &s;carcely enough con&s;idered to de&s;erve a di&s;tinct &s;pecification. Such a view was given of the anatomy of the human body as was entitled to applau&s;e, and well calculated to in&s;pire the young men with the &s;entiments of veneration and love for the &s;upreme Artificer. In the latter years of their cour&s;e, a large &s;y&s;tem, drawn by Dr. Doddridge him&s;elf, was read of Jewi&s;h antiquities, with references to the princi|pal writers on the &s;ubject; in order to illu&s;trate numberle&s;s pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which could not otherwi&s;e be &s;o well under&s;tood. In eccle|&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory the Doctor lectured from Lampe's Epitome. On the various &s;ects and doctrines of the ancient philo&s;ophers he occa&s;ionally gave &s;ome in&s;truction from Buddaeus's Compendium; but this matter was never pur&s;ued to any con&s;i|derable extent.</P>
<P>All the&s;e branches of &s;tudy, though of no &s;mall con&s;equence, were, however, &s;ubordinate to what was the grand object of the attention of the young men, during three years of their cour&s;e&punc;
<PB N="200" REF="025154_0198_0FCE749E92B513E8">
which was Dr. Doddridge's Sy&s;tem of Divinity, in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word; including what is mo&s;t material in pneumatology and ethics. In this work were contained, in as few words as per&s;picuity would admit, the principal things which had occurred to the author's ob&s;ervation, relating to the con&s;titution and properties of the human mind, the proofs of the exi&s;tence and at|tributes of GOD, the nature of moral virtue, the various parts of it, the means &s;ub&s;ervient to it, and the &s;anctions by which its precepts, con&s;ider|ed as the natural law of the &s;upreme Being, are enforced. Under this head the arguments for a future life, deducible from the light of rea|&s;on, were particularly examined. A &s;urvey was added, of what is, and generally has been, the &s;tate of virtue in the world; whence a tran&s;ition was ea&s;y to the nece&s;&s;ity of a revelation, the en|couragement to hope for it, and the kind of evi|dence with which it might probably be attend|ed. Hence the work proceeded to the actual evidence that may be produced in favour of that revelation which is contained in the &s;criptures. The genuinene&s;s, credibility, and in&s;piration of the &s;acred books were then treated upon at large, and vindicated from the mo&s;t material objections that have been urged again&s;t them by &s;ceptical writers. This part of Dr. Doddridge's lectures was, perhaps of all others, the mo&s;t important and u&s;eful. Having laid a firm foundation in &s;o ample a &s;tatement of the evidences of chri&s;tiani|ty, he entered into a copious detail of what were, or, at lea&s;t, what appeared to him to be, the doctrines of &s;cripture. In &s;o doing, though he
<PB N="201" REF="025154_0199_0FCE73E02833B7B0">
&s;tated and maintained his own opinions, which in a con&s;iderable degree were Calvini&s;tical, he never a&s;&s;umed the character of a dogmati&s;t. He re|pre&s;ented the arguments, and referred to the au|thorities on both &s;ides. The &s;tudents were left to judge for them&s;elves; and they did judge for them&s;elves, with his perfect concurrence and ap|probation, though no doubt, it was natural for him to be plea&s;ed when their &s;entiments coin|cided with his own. Where this was not the ca&s;e, it made no alteration in his affection and kind treatment, as the writer of the pre&s;ent nar|rative can gratefully witne&s;s. What &s;eemed mo&s;t evident to Dr. Doddridge on the &s;ubjects con&s;idered by him was dige&s;ted into the form of propo&s;itions, &s;ome of which were problemati|cal; and the chief controver&s;ies relative to each head were thrown into &s;cholia. For the illu&s;|tration of all of them, a large collection was made of references, in which the &s;entiments and rea&s;onings of the principal authors on the points in que&s;tion might be &s;een in their own words. It was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the pupils to read and abridge the&s;e references in the intervals between the lectures. Dr. Doddridge's Sy&s;tem of Divin|ity was his capital work, as a tutor. Much la|bour was &s;pent by him upon it; and he was continually enriching it with his remark on any new pruductions upon the various &s;ubjects to which it extended. It was tran&s;cribed by the generality of the &s;tudents; and it may be truly ob&s;erved concerning it, that it was well calcula|ted to lead them gradually on, from the fir&s;t prin|ciples, to the mo&s;t important and difficult part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of theological knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="025154_0200_0FCE38362EE69F50">Be&s;ides Dr. Doddridge's expo&s;itions in the family, critical lectures on the New Te&s;tament were delivered once a week, which the young men were permitted and encouraged to tran&s;cribe. In the&s;e were contained his ob&s;ervations on the language, meaning, and de&s;ign of the &s;acred writings, and the interpretations and critici&s;ms of the mo&s;t eminent commentators. Many of the&s;e ob&s;ervations occur in his Family Expo&s;itor. As a &s;et of lectures, they never attained to a very full and perfect form.</P>
<P>Polite literature, if not copiou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon, was not, however, by any means neglected. No incon&s;iderable advantage was derived from the Doctor's being him&s;elf a man of ta&s;te, and a ma&s;ter of elegant compo&s;ition. Without much direct in&s;truction, the remarks which he occa|&s;ionally and frequently made on the be&s;t writers, ancient and modern, were of great utility. The &s;tudents, too, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a cla&s;&s;ical turn, cheri&s;hed in each other, by their di&s;cu&s;&s;ions and debates, the principles of di&s;cernment with re|gard to the beauties of authors, whether in pro&s;e or ver&s;e.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t year of Dr. Doddridge's cour&s;e a &s;et of lectures was given on preaching and the pa&s;toral care. The&s;e contained directions con|cerning the method to be taken by the pupils to fit them for appearing with credit in the pulpit; the character of the chief practical divines and commentators; particular rules for the compo|&s;ition, &s;tyle, arrangement, and delivery of &s;er|mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; and in&s;tructions relating to public prayer, expo&s;ition&punc; catechi&s;ing, the admini&s;tration of the
<PB N="203" REF="025154_0201_0FCE73E4A207EDE8">
&s;acraments, and vi&s;iting. To the&s;e were added many general maxims for their conver&s;ation and conduct as mini&s;ters, and a variety of prudential hints for their behaviour in the particular cir|cum&s;tances and connections in which they might be placed. A regard to truth obliges me to ob|&s;erve, that in the&s;e lectures, the Doctor carried his ideas of conde&s;cen&s;ion to the weakne&s;s, and accommodation to the prejudices, of mankind, farther than &s;ome per&s;ons will entirely approve. But in &s;o doing he acted, I doubt not, with the mo&s;t upright views, and from a &s;incere de&s;ire to be u&s;eful. His &s;entiments on this head had been early &s;tated by him in his "Free Thoughts on the mo&s;t probable Means of reviving the Di&s;|&s;enting Intere&s;t."</P>
<P><Q>While the &s;tudents, &s;ays Mr. Orton,
were pur&s;uing the&s;e important &s;tudies, &s;ome lectures were given them on civil law, the hierogly|phics and mythology of the ancients, the Eng|li&s;h hi&s;tory, particularly the hi&s;tory of non|conformity, and the principles on which a &s;ep|aration from the church of England is found|ed.</Q>
Such lectures might, I doubt not, be occa&s;ionally read; but they made no &s;tated and regular part of the academical cour&s;e. None of them, excepting tho&s;e on nonconformity, were delivered during my re&s;idence at Northampton. I &s;peak with the greater confidence on the &s;ub|ject, as I was never ab&s;ent from a &s;ingle lecture till the la&s;t month of my cour&s;e, when I was prevented from attending on two or three Mon|days, in con&s;equence of having been engaged at a di&s;tance as an occa&s;ional preacher. The health
<PB N="204" REF="025154_0202_0FCE73E6E2FE6790">
which enabled me, and the diligence that led me to maintain this con&s;tant attendance, I have rea|&s;on to reflect upon with thankfulne&s;s and plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>One day in every week was &s;et apart for pub|lic exerci&s;es; at which times the tran&s;lations and orations of the junior pupils were read and ex|amined. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the young men as had entered on the &s;tudy of pneumatology and ethics, pro|duced in their turns the&s;es on the &s;everal &s;ub|jects a&s;&s;igned them, which were mutually oppo|&s;ed and defended.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Tho&s;e, &s;ays Mr. Orton,
who had fini&s;hed ethics delivered ho|milies (as they were called, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from &s;ermons) on the natural and moral perfections of GOD, and the &s;everal branches of moral virtue.</Q>
But no &s;uch homilies, as di&s;tinct from orations and the&s;es, occur to my recollection. Indeed, I am convinced that the di&s;|tinction did not take place in my time.</NOTE> The &s;enior &s;tudents brought analy&s;es of &s;cripture, the &s;chemes of &s;ermons, and afterwards the &s;ermons them&s;elves, which they &s;ubmitted to the Doctor's examination and correction; and in this part of his work he was very exact, careful, and friendly; for he e&s;teemed his remarks on their di&s;cour&s;es more u&s;eful to the young preachers than any general rules of compo&s;ition which could be offered them by tho&s;e who were them&s;elves mo&s;t eminent in the profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was Dr. Doddridge's care, that his pupils, through the whole &s;eries of their &s;tudies, might have &s;uch a variety of lectures weekly, as, with|out di&s;tracting them, would entertain and en|gage their minds. While they were attending and &s;tudying objects of the greate&s;t importance, &s;ome of &s;maller moment, though beneficial in them&s;elves, were &s;et before them at proper inter|vals.
<PB N="205" REF="025154_0203_0FCE73E830F6D210">
It was contrived that they &s;hould have as much to read, between each lecture, as might keep them well employed; due time being al|lowed for nece&s;&s;ary relaxations, and the reading of practical writers. The habitual peru&s;al of &s;uch writers was recommended by their tutor with peculiar energy, and &s;ingular propriety; for few things can more effectually contribute to improve the under&s;tanding and mend the heart, and to fit a young man for mini&s;terial du|ty and u&s;efulne&s;s, than a large acquaintance with that mo&s;t valuable part of literature, the great body of Engli&s;h &s;ermons, and of compo&s;itions which have a &s;imilar nature and tendency. Dr. Doddridge often examined what books the &s;tu|dents read, be&s;ides tho&s;e to which they were re|ferred in their lectures, and directed them to &s;uch as were be&s;t &s;uited to their age, character, and intended profe&s;&s;ion. In this re&s;pect they were very advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, as they enjoyed the u&s;e of a valuable library, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal thou&s;and volumes. To this library, under &s;ome prudent regulations, they had acce&s;s at all times. As their tutor was &s;en&s;ible that a numerous collec|tion of books might be a &s;nare, rather than a benefit, to the &s;tudents, unle&s;s they had an ex|perienced friend to direct them in the choice of them, and in the proper period for their being peru&s;ed, he was particularly &s;olicitous that they might have &s;uitable advice on the &s;ubject. With this view, he &s;ometimes gave to his pupils lec|tures on the books in the library; going over the &s;everal &s;helves in order, and informing them of the character of each work, and its author&punc;
<PB N="206" REF="025154_0204_0FCE73E9B44A3B00">
&s;o far as he was known. His ob&s;ervations were not only in&s;tructive but plea&s;ant; being often in|termixed with anecdotes of the writers who were mentioned. It may be truly &s;aid of the lectures on the library, that they di&s;played the &s;urpri&s;ing extent of the Doctor's reading and knowledge, and that they were u&s;eful in a variety of re&s;pects. My mind &s;till retains, with advantage and plea|&s;ure, the impre&s;&s;ion of many of his remarks.</P>
<P>Dr. Doddridge's manner of lecturing was well adapted to engage the attention and love of his pupils, and to promote their diligent &s;tudy of the &s;ubjects upon which he treated. He ex|pected from them, when they a&s;&s;embled in their re&s;pective cla&s;&s;es, an account of the rea&s;onings, demon&s;trations, &s;criptures, or facts con&s;idered in the former lectures and references; and he al|lowed and encouraged them to propo&s;e any ob|jections, which might ari&s;e in their own minds, or had occurred in the authors they peru&s;ed. If, at any time, their objections were petulant or impertinent, he patiently heard and mildly an|&s;wered them; for he put on no magi&s;terial airs, but always addre&s;&s;ed them with the freedom and tenderne&s;s of a father. He frequently and warm|ly urged them not to take their &s;y&s;tem of divini|ty from any man or body of men, but from the <HI>Bible.</HI> It was the <HI>Bible</HI> that he always referred and appealed to, upon every point in que&s;tion, to which it could be &s;uppo&s;ed to give any light. The appearances of bigotry and uncharitablene&s;s were re&s;olutely checked by him; and he endea|vored to cure tho&s;e who di&s;covered any &s;ymptoms of this kind, by &s;hewing them what might be
<PB N="207" REF="025154_0205_0FCE73EB2F6865F8">
&s;aid in &s;upport of the principles they di&s;liked, and di&s;playing the great learning and excellent characters of many by whom they were e&s;pou&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was Dr. Doddridge's great aim to give his pupils ju&s;t and &s;ublime views of the chri&s;tian mini&s;try, and to lead them to direct all their &s;tudies &s;o as to increa&s;e their abilities and quali|fications for that important office. As he was de&s;irous that they &s;hould be very &s;erious preach|ers, he was particularly anxious that they might have a deep &s;en&s;e of divine things upon their own minds, and be well acquainted with the workings of the human heart with regard to eter|nal concerns; and he recommended to them, in the choice of the &s;ubjects upon which he preach|ed, and in the manner of treating them, to have an e&s;pecial view to the edification of the bulk of the people. Nor did he think this incon&s;i&s;tent with a due attention to the elegance of compo&s;i|tion. That the &s;tudents might be qualified to appear with e&s;teem and honour in the world, and pre&s;ide over politer &s;ocieties with acceptance, he endeavoured to form them to an agreeable ad|dre&s;s and behaviour. This the oeconomy and decorum of his own family was well calculated to produce. He ob&s;erved, likewi&s;e, their way of &s;peaking, in&s;tructed them in the proper man|ner of pronunciation, and labored to prevent their contracting any unnatural tone or ge&s;ture. While he delivered his cautions upon the&s;e heads, &s;uch was his humility, that he warned them not to imitate him&s;elf in an error of this kind, of which he was &s;en&s;ible, but which he could not entirely correct.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi, &s;upra, p. 76&mdash;90.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="025154_0206_0FCE73ECB8F84250">Another method taken by Dr. Doddridge, to qualify his pupils for appearing with early ad|vantage in the pulpit, mu&s;t not be forgotten. The &s;enior &s;tudents, before they began to preach, were accu&s;tomed, on the Sunday evenings, to vi&s;it the neigbouring villages, and to hold pri|vate meetings for religious wor&s;hip in &s;ome li|cen&s;ed hou&s;es. It was not uncommon for fifty or &s;ixty, or perhaps a larger number of people, to a&s;&s;emble on the&s;e occa&s;ions. Two of the young men u&s;ually went together; when a practical &s;ermon was repeated, and one of them prayed before and the other after it, with proper intervals of &s;inging. This cu&s;tom was eminent|ly u&s;eful, both in exerci&s;ing the talents of the pupils, and in preparing them to appear with greater courage and freedom when they entered upon the mini&s;try. Sometimes di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, when accompanied with timidity and ba&s;hfulne&s;s, have been greatly ob&s;cured from the want of &s;uch preparatory exerci&s;es. The cu&s;tom was otherwi&s;e in no &s;mall degree beneficial, as it tended to remove prejudices again&s;t the di&s;&s;ent|ers, and to promote the ends of &s;erious religion.</P>
<P>One proof of Dr. Doddridge's zealous con|cern for the improvement of his pupils, was, that he allowed them a free acce&s;s to him in his own &s;tudy, to a&s;k his advice with regard to any part of their cour&s;e, and to mention to him &s;uch difficulties as occurred to them either in their private reading or their lectures. In the&s;e ca&s;es he treated them with the utmo&s;t candour and tenderne&s;s, and pointed out whatever he thought would contribute to their advancement in know|ledge.
<PB N="209" REF="025154_0207_0FCE73F20A0FB2E8">
While he was thus &s;olicitous to pro|mote their intellectual acquirements, it was his main care, and what he apprehended to be mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to their u&s;efulne&s;s, that they might be pious and virtuous men. With this view the &s;tricte&s;t regard was paid to their moral charac|ters; and their behaviour, when not employed in their &s;tudies or at lecture, was watchfully in|&s;pected. Inquiry was made what hou&s;es they frequented, and what company they kept; and none of the &s;tudents were permitted to be from home after ten o'clock at night, under penalty of a con&s;iderable forfeiture. When any thing was found irregular in their conduct, or there ap|peared to be a danger of their falling into tempt|ation, the Doctor privately admoni&s;hed them in the mo&s;t &s;erious and affectionate manner. Nor was he &s;atisfied with the external decorum of their behaviour, but was anxious to perceive in them the genuine evidences of real religion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 91&mdash;96.</NOTE></P>
<P>Dr. Doddridge "often expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;h," &s;ays Mr. Orton,
<Q>that different places of edu|cation could be provided for per&s;ons intended for the mini&s;try and tho&s;e for other profe&s;&s;ions; as he thought it would be better &s;ecurity for the religious character of the former; and &s;ome indulgencies might be allowed to the others, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of rank and fortune; that were not proper for divinity &s;tudents, as few of them were likely ever to be affluent in their circum|&s;tances.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 101.</NOTE> Much as I revere the memory of my tutor, and &s;incere as the re&s;pect is which I entertain for his judgment on many points, I do

not agree with him in this opinion. Perhaps it might be delivered by him at &s;ea&s;ons of peculiar difficulty and embarra&s;&s;ment. It is certain that he did not &s;trictly accord with it in his own practice; for he took young gentlemen of for|tune into his hou&s;e to the end of his life; and during the whole of my pupilage, which was at a time when his academy was in a very flouri&s;h|ing &s;tate, I do not recollect that any of the theo|logical &s;tudents were corrupted by the others. There is no po&s;&s;ibility of forming any plan of education, with regard to which objections may not be made, and inconveniences &s;ugge&s;ted. How many di&s;&s;ertations and treati&s;es have been written concerning the que&s;tion which is mo&s;t preferable, a private or a public education, with|out having hitherto brought the world to an uniformity of &s;entiment upon the &s;ubject! Dif|ferent minds, as they are differently con&s;tituted, and as particular difficulties &s;trike them, will view matters of this kind in a diver&s;ity of lights. For my own part, all the knowledge and expe|rience which I have been able to obtain with re&s;pect to the point in debate, have convinced me that con&s;iderable advantages may, and do, ari&s;e from the connection of lay-pupils with tho&s;e who are intended for divinity.</P>
<P>So great was Dr. Doddridge's reputation as a tutor, that the number of his &s;tudents was large, being, one year with another, thirty-four; and the academy was u&s;ually on the increa&s;e. Dur|ing the twenty-two years in which he &s;u&s;tained this office, he had about two hundred young men under his care, of whom one hundred and

twenty entered upon the mini&s;try, and &s;ome who were de&s;igned for it died while under his in&s;truc|tions. Several of his pupils were from Scot|land and Holland. One per&s;on, who was in|tended for orders in the church of England, cho&s;e to &s;pend a year or two under his tuition, before he went to the Univer&s;ity. Others, who&s;e parents were of that church, were placed in the Doctor's family, and were readily allowed to attend the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip; for the con|&s;titution of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">demy was perfectly catholic. Some young divines from Scotland, who had &s;tudied and taken the u&s;ual degrees in the Uni|ver&s;ities, and who had even begun to preach, came to attend his divinity lectures, and to re|ceive his in&s;tructions, before they &s;ettled with pari&s;hes in their native country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 102, 103.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such was the manner in which Dr. Dod|dridge filled up his difficult and honourable &s;ta|tion as a tutor; and from this &s;urvey of his con|duct, which might have been extended farther, and which is in certain re&s;pects more copiou&s;ly dwelt upon by Mr. Orton, every pious and ju|dicious reader will acknowledge the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of Providence, in rai&s;ing up &s;o excel|lent a per&s;on, and preparing him for &s;o large a &s;phere of u&s;efulne&s;s.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 104.</NOTE></P>

The academy at Warrington was formed on the &s;cheme of three independent <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors,</HI> as they might ju&s;tly be entitled; and when we mention among them (not to name other re&s;pectable per|&s;ons) &s;uch men as Dr. Taylor, Dr. Aikin, Dr. Prie&s;tley, Dr. Reinhold For&s;ter, Mr. Gilbert Wakefield, and Dr. Enfield, we need not &s;ay how ably it was in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;upplied. The in&s;ti|tution at Hoxton was on the &s;ame foundation; Dr. Savage, Dr. Rees, and my&s;elf, being di&s;|tinct and un&s;ubordinate tutors in theological, mathematical, and philological departments. A &s;imilar arrangement takes place at the &s;eminary of our congregational brethren in Homerton. The new college at Hackney has gone upon the plan of a &s;till greater number of preceptors. Though the academy heretofore at Daventry, and &s;ince removed to Northampton, and that at Manche&s;ter, retain the form of one principal tu|tor, there are two &s;eparate a&s;&s;i&s;tants for the phi|lo&s;ophical and cla&s;&s;ical &s;tudies.</P>
<P>May I be permitted to offer a brief &s;ketch of theological education? A &s;olid foundation ought to be laid in a truly grammatical acquaintance with the Latin and Greek tongues; and the higher cla&s;&s;ical writers &s;hould be read, more or le&s;s, through the whole cour&s;e. Hebrew at lea&s;t, among&s;t the Oriental languages, &s;hould by no means be neglected. The different branches of mathematical literature, and of natural philo|&s;ophy, will demand a &s;erious and diligent atten|tion. Logic, metaphy&s;ics, univer&s;al grammar,
<PB N="213" REF="025154_0211_0FCE73FAD8D19F58">
rhetoric, critici&s;m, chronology, and hi&s;tory, are objects an acquaintance with which is not a lit|tle de&s;irable. With re&s;pect to general divinity, including in that term pneumatology and ethics, I cannot help thinking that Dr. Doddridge's cour&s;e of lectures, with proper additions, improve|ments, and references to more recent authors, might &s;till be made u&s;e of with eminent advan|tage. As it points out, in order, the mo&s;t im|portant objects of &s;tudy, and the writers on both &s;ides of the que&s;tions di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ng man will know where to apply for future informa|tion. Jewi&s;h antiquities and eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;to|ry need &s;carcely to be mentioned, as they cannot be forgotten. If the &s;y&s;tems of the ancient phi|lo&s;ophers &s;hould be thought to merit much re|gard during academical &s;tudies, ample materials may be collected from Dr. Enfield's late mo&s;t valuable work. A &s;eries of lectures on the divine di&s;pen&s;ations would be peculiarly u&s;eful. Such a &s;et of lectures was begun by Dr. Taylor at Warrington, but he did not live to complete the de&s;ign. His work, &s;o far as it was carried, is worthy of approbation, though the di&s;cour&s;es are &s;ometimes rather too declamatory, and per|haps not &s;ufficiently accurate and critical. They have, however, de&s;ervedly found a place in the Bi&s;hop of Landaff's Collection of Theological Tracts. Another thing of con&s;equence is a &s;e|ries of ob&s;ervations on the times and occa&s;ions on which the books, e&s;pecially of the New Te&s;ta|ment, were written, the ancient copies and ver|&s;ions, and the principal commentators. The objects I particularly allude to, are tho&s;e which
<PB N="214" REF="025154_0212_0FCE73FC709C6D70">
are particularly treated of by Michaelis, Lardner, Jones, and Campbell. In addition to all the&s;e, a &s;et of preaching lectures, more improved than tho&s;e of Dr. Doddridge, and more adapted to pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, would be an important acqui&s;ition. With the be&s;t in&s;truction, it is not to be expected that all young men &s;hould be equally accompli&s;hed. It will be &s;ufficient for many that they have a competent &s;tock of know|ledge, united with &s;erious dipo&s;itions. It is, however, very de&s;irable that &s;ome &s;hould &s;o far ri&s;e above the common rank, as to be able, in their day, to &s;upport the honour of revelation again&s;t the attacks of its enemies, and to appear as defenders of the true chri&s;tian doctrines. It would not be ami&s;s, if a few, of &s;uperior capaci|ties and literature, would, after they quit the &s;eminaries of education, &s;tudy &s;omewhat more &s;y&s;tematically than is frequently done. In that ca&s;e, the di&s;&s;enters would not be at a lo&s;s for tutors in peculiar emergencies. If I have a&s;&s;um|ed too great a liberty in &s;ugge&s;ting the&s;e hints, I hope to be forgiven; as I have written not merely from a regard to the honour and benefit of the denomination of chri&s;tians to which I more immediately belong, but with a view to the general intere&s;ts of religion and learning.</P>
<P>Since the abilities of Mr. Doddridge were &s;uch as called him &s;o early in life to the import|ant office of a theological tutor, it was natural to expect, from the &s;ame talents, that it would not be long before he appeared in the world as an author. His fir&s;t di&s;tinct publication, which was in 1730, and printed without his name,
<PB N="215" REF="025154_0213_0FCE73FDF503CAE8">
was entitled,
<Q>Free Thoughts on the mo&s;t probable Means of reviving the Di&s;&s;enting In|tere&s;t, occa&s;ioned by the late Enquiry into the Cau&s;es of its Decay.</Q>
The writer of the Enquiry was for a time &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ome lay-gentleman; but, in fact, it came from the pen of a young di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, of the name of Gough, who afterwards conformed to the church; and who, in 1750, publi&s;hed a volume of &s;ermons, which have con&s;iderable merit as ju|dicious and elegant compo&s;itions. Mr. Dod|dridge's pamphlet, wherein he materially differ|ed from Mr. Gough with regard to the point in que&s;tion, is a model of that candour and polite|ne&s;s with which remarks may be made on an|other's writings and opinions. The fir&s;t in|&s;tance in which Mr. Doddridge di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a practical divine was in 1732, when he publi&s;hed
<Q>Sermons on the Education of Children.</Q>
The&s;e were principally intended for the u&s;e of his own congregation; and they contain, in a little compa&s;s, a variety of impor|tant advices and affecting motives, tending to a&s;|&s;i&s;t and animate parents in the di&s;charge of &s;o momentous a duty. They were accompanied with a recommendatory preface by Mr. Some, and have &s;ince gone through &s;everal editions. In 1735, Mr. Doddridge's concern for the ri&s;ing generation was &s;till farther di&s;played, in "Ser|mons to young People;" being &s;even in num|ber, and which have met with equal &s;ucce&s;s in the world. A di&s;cour&s;e was printed by him in the &s;ame year entitled, "The Care of the Soul urged as the One Thing needful," This was
<PB N="216" REF="025154_0214_0FCE73FF6B2D8EF0">
followed, in 1735-6, by a Sermon on the "Ab|&s;urdity and Iniquity of Per&s;ecution for Con|&s;cience-Sake, in all its Forms and Degrees." It had been preached, I believe, on the preceding fifth of November, and, when it came from the pre&s;s, was recommended to the public, in a &s;hort preface, by Mr. Some, as the be&s;t he had ever &s;een on the &s;ubject, in &s;o narrow a compa&s;s. In all re&s;pects it is indeed an elaborate and excellent di&s;cour&s;e, di&s;playing with great energy and ele|gance the grand principles of toleration and re|ligious liberty.</P>
<P>In the year 1736 the two Colleges of the Univer&s;ity of Aberdeen, in Scotland, concurred in conferring upon Mr. Doddridge the degree of Doctor in Divinity; upon which occa&s;ion his pupils thought it a proper piece of re&s;pect to congratulate him in a body. He was gratified by their compliment, but told them, in an&s;wer to it,
<Q>that their learning, piety, and zeal, would be more to his honour, and give him a thou&s;and times more plea&s;ure, than his degree, or any other token of public e&s;teem.</Q>
In the &s;ame year he publi&s;hed
<Q>Ten Sermons on the Power and Grace of Chri&s;t,</Q>
and
<Q>the Evidences of his glorious Go&s;pel.</Q>
The three la&s;t, on the "Evidences of the Go&s;pel," were afterwards &s;ep|arately printed, at the particular reque&s;t of one of the fir&s;t dignitaries of the church of England. They contain a very judicious &s;ummary of &s;everal of the principal arguments in &s;upport of the chri&s;|tian revelation, and e&s;pecially of tho&s;e which prove the genuinene&s;s and credibility of the evan|gelical hi&s;tory. The author had the great &s;ati&s;|faction
<PB N="217" REF="025154_0215_0FCE740449A711C0">
of knowing that the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es were the means of converting to the belief of our holy re|ligion two gentlemen of liberal education and di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, who had been &s;ceptical upon this head. One of them, who had endea|voured to prejudice others again&s;t the evidences and contents of the go&s;pel, became a zealous preacher of chri&s;tianity, as well as a &s;hining or|nament to it in his life and manners.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 98, 112, 117, 118.</NOTE></P>
<P>Dr. Doddridge's next appearance from the pre&s;s was on an occa&s;ion very melancholy and affecting to him&s;elf and Mrs Doddridge. This was the lo&s;s of his elde&s;t daughter, a very amia|ble and hopeful child of nearly five years of age. The &s;ermon which he preached on this event, and which was publi&s;hed in 1736-7, is entitled, "Submi&s;&s;ion to Divine Providence on the Death of Children, recommended and enforced." It is an admirable di&s;cour&s;e, which di&s;plays in a very &s;trong and &s;triking light the united piety and ten|derne&s;s of the author's mind. Few &s;uperior in|&s;tances of pathetic eloquence are to be met with in the Engli&s;h language. In 1737 the Doctor engaged in an ordination &s;ervice at Wi&s;beach St. Peter's, in the I&s;le of Ely. The part alloted him was the &s;er|mon, which was printed under the title of "The Temper and Conduct of the primitive Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel illu&s;trated and recommended." Mr. William John&s;ton, the gentleman ordained, af|terwards removed to Harborough, and at length &s;ettled at Tunbridge-Wells, at which place he died, and where he was well known and ju&s;tly re&s;pected by many con&s;iderable per&s;ons. He
<PB N="218" REF="025154_0216_0FCE7405F5AA6F10">
was the author of a pronouncing and &s;pelling Dictionary, which appeared in 12mo, in 1764, and which was not, in &s;ome re&s;pects, without its utility. It is now, I believe, entirely &s;uper&s;eded by the far more elaborate and perfect works of Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Walker. Dr. Doddridge, in 1737-8, was called to officiate at the funeral of an old and worthy friend, the Rev. Mr. John Norris, of Welford in Northampton&s;hire, who had been thirty-eight years di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter at that place. The di&s;cour&s;e which the Doctor preached, and printed, on the occa&s;ion, is enti|tled,
<Q>Practical Reflections on the Character and Death of Enoch.</Q>
On the ninth of No|vember, 1738, a day of fa&s;ting and prayer was ob&s;erved at Wellingborough, on account of a dreadful fire which had de&s;troyed a con&s;iderable part of the town; and the &s;ermon, which was a&s;&s;igned to Dr. Doddridge, and was in part de|livered extempore, was publi&s;hed, from the be&s;t recollection he could make of it, at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of the hearers.</P>
<P>In 1739, our author gave to the public the fir&s;t volume, in quarto, of his great work,
<Q>The Family Expo&s;itor; or, a Paraphra&s;e and Ver&s;ion of the New Te&s;tament: with criti|cal Notes, and a practical Improvement of each Section.</Q>
This volume contained the former part of the Hi&s;tory of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as recorded in the four Evangeli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> di&s;|po&s;ed in the order of an harmony, and was u&s;her|ed into the world by a very numerous and hon|ourable li&s;t of &s;ub&s;cribers. The dedication, which was to her Royal Highne&s;s the Prince&s;s
<PB N="219" REF="025154_0217_0FCE7406E98662E8">
of Wales, affords one of the fine&s;t &s;pecimens which Dr. Doddridge has given of his talents in elegant compo&s;ition. If the prai&s;es &s;hould be thought &s;ufficiently copious, they are, at the &s;ame time, mixed with important hints of in|&s;truction; and nothing appears to be &s;aid but what evidently came from the heart. The &s;econd volume of the work was publi&s;hed in 1740, concluding the evangelical hi&s;tory. During the&s;e two years, the Doctor printed only one &s;ermon, which was on the
<Q>Nece&s;&s;ity of a general Reformation in order to a well grounded Hope of Succe&s;s in War;</Q>
and which had been preached by him at North|ampton, on the ninth of January, 1739-40, being the day appointed by his Maje&s;ty for public humiliation. It was dedicated to his friend Colonel Gardiner. In 1741, our author was called upon to pay a tribute of re&s;pect to the memory of a worthy di&s;&s;enting min|i&s;ter in London, the Rev. Mr. John Newman, by delivering an oration at his grave, and after|terwards committing it to the pre&s;s. Soon after, he publi&s;hed
<Q>The Scripture Doctrine of Sal|vation by Grace through Faith, illu&s;trated and improved in two Sermons, the &s;ub&s;tance of which was preached at Rowell in Northamp|ton&s;hire.</Q>
But the principal production of Dr. Doddridge, during this year, was a &s;et of "Practical Di&s;cour&s;es on Regeneration," which had been delivered on Sunday evenings, and at|tended with remarkable diligence, by many per|&s;ons of different per&s;uations, to &s;ome of whom they were eminetly u&s;eful. The character given
<PB N="220" REF="025154_0218_0FCE74086AC81A48">
of them by a foreign divine, on their being tran&s;|lated into Dutch, among other high encomiums, was, that they united orthodoxy with modera|tion, zeal with meekne&s;s, and deep, hidden wi&s;|dom with uncommon clearne&s;s; that &s;implicity &s;hone in them without coldne&s;s, elegance with|out painting, and &s;ublimity without bomba&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;upra, p. 118, 119.</NOTE></P>
<P>The publication of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es was &s;uc|ceeded by that of a &s;ingle &s;ermon, entitled,
<Q>The Evil and Danger of neglecting the Souls of Men plainly and &s;eriou&s;ly repre&s;ented.</Q>
It had been preached in October, 1741, at a meet|ing of mini&s;ters, at Kettering in Northampton|&s;hire. When publi&s;hed, which was in Febru|ary, 1741-2, it was dedicated to the a&s;&s;ociated Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, with whom the author had an interview at Denton, in the preceding &s;ummer, and to whom he had propo&s;ed a &s;cheme for the revival of religion, the heads of which are given in the dedication. The only compo|&s;ition from the pulpit which was printed by Dr. Doddridge in 1742, was a Charge, delivered in St. Ives Huntingdon&s;hire, on the twelfth of Augu&s;t, at the ordination of Mr. John Jennings, the &s;on of the Doctor's former tutor. In the latter end of the &s;ame year, our author began the publication of the &s;ole controver&s;ial work in which he could properly ever have been &s;aid to have engaged. This was occa&s;ioned by a pamphlet, entitled, "Chri&s;tianity not founded on argument," which was much &s;poken of at the time of its appearance, and which, under
<PB N="221" REF="025154_0219_0FCE740D370CDD70">
the form of a zeal for orthodoxy, contained a &s;evere attack on our holy religion. Dr. Dod|dridge's an&s;wer was compri&s;ed in three letters, the &s;econd and third of which were publi&s;hed in 1743. In the fir&s;t he &s;tated the degree of rational evidence for the divine authority of chri&s;tianity, to which an illiterate, well di&s;po&s;ed per&s;on may attain. The &s;econd was employed in endeavoring to &s;hew the rea&s;onablene&s;s of an|nexing a condemnatory &s;entence on unbelievers, as a part of the chri&s;tian revelation. In the third the doctrine of divine influences was con|&s;idered.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doddridge's Letters, p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE> The&s;e an&s;wers, which are written with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s and candour, met with a very favourable reception in the world, and the Doctor was thanked for them by &s;ome men of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and abilities. The la&s;t letter in particular was e&s;teemed by many thinking per&s;ons to contain the be&s;t illu&s;tration and the mo&s;t rational and full defence of the in|fluences of the Spirit upon the human heart, which had hitherto been publi&s;hed. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></NOTE> Dr. Doddridge's other publications in 1743 were,

His di&s;cour&s;e in re|commendation of it, which was dedicated to the Earl of Halifax, is indeed a mo&s;t excellent one, and was characteri&s;ed by Dr. Oliver, in a letter to the author, as follows:

<P>Towards the clo&s;e of the &s;ame year, Dr. Doddridge became a member of a Philo&s;ophical Society which was formed at Northampton, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal ingenious and re&s;pectable gentlemen in that town and its neighbourhood. During the cour&s;e of their meetings in 1744, he exhibited two papers, the one on the Doctrine of Pendulums, and the other on the Laws of Communication of Motion, as well in ela&s;tic as in non-ela&s;tic bodies. The mo&s;t material pro|po&s;itions relating to both were &s;et in &s;o plain and ea&s;y a light in the&s;e papers, that he was re|que&s;ted to permit tran&s;cripts of them to be de|po&s;ited among other communications of the gentlemen concerned, &s;ome of which appear to have been curious and u&s;eful.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gentleman's Magazine, vol. xvi. p. 475&mdash;477</NOTE> Our author's name occurs in the Tran&s;actions of the Royal Society.

<P>The year 1745, was di&s;tingui&s;hed in Dr. Doddridge's life by the appearance of one of the mo&s;t popular and one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful of his practical works. This was "The Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Religion in the Soul," illu&s;trated in a cour&s;e of &s;erious addre&s;&s;es, &s;uited to per&s;ons of every character and circum&s;tance, with a de|vout meditation or prayer added to each chapter.

Dr. Watts had formed a &s;imilar de&s;ign; but hav|ing been prevented from the execution of it by his growing infirmities, he recommended it to our author, as the be&s;t qualified of all his ac|quaintance for di&s;charging it in the manner that would be acceptable and beneficial to the world. It was with &s;ome reluctance that Dr. Doddridge, amid&s;t his various other weighty concerns, agreed to comply with the reque&s;t of his venerable friend; but it was urged with an importunity that he could not re&s;i&s;t; and he had afterwards the highe&s;t rea|&s;on to rejoice in his compliance. When the work was fini&s;hed, Dr. Watts revi&s;ed as much of it as his health would permit. This book was not only well received by the di&s;&s;enters, but met with an equal reception, and the warme&s;t applau&s;es, from &s;everal per&s;ons of great emi|nence for rank, learning, and piety, both clergy and laity, in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 119, 120.</NOTE> Dr. Ay&s;cough, formerly preceptor to the children of Frederic Prince of Wales, &s;peaking of it, &s;ays,

to the author,
<Q>much obliged to you for your kind pre&s;ent of the <HI>Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Reli|gion in the Soul.</HI> I read it over with plea&s;ure, and hope, not without &s;ome advantage from a book, which I truly think is calculated for very con&s;iderable u&s;efulne&s;s. The &s;erious &s;pi|rit it breathes mu&s;t be ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">table to all who retain any &s;eeds of piety; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the compa&s;s of imagination, and force of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">e&s;&s;ion, which di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves throughout the whole of the performance, &s;how that the beauties of the &s;acred writings are not de&s;pi&s;ed by all the ma&s;ters of human eloquence. This might &s;uffice for me to &s;ay concerning a book that is &s;o univer&s;ally admired by tho&s;e to who&s;e judg|ment and piety I pay the greate&s;t reverence; and all perhaps that in prudence I ought to &s;ay; if I merely con&s;ulted the pre&s;erving that credit you have hitherto been &s;o kind as to give to my under&s;tanding. But as I had ra|ther de&s;erve your friend&s;hip than gain your ap|plau&s;e, and be e&s;teemed injudicious than in|&s;incere, I will venture (&s;ince you have de&s;ired it) to &s;end a remark or two on this perform|ance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Your book propo&s;es to draw a plan of a re|ligious di&s;po&s;ition, or habit, from its fir&s;t foundation to its highe&s;t perfection in the pre|&s;ent &s;tate; and to con&s;ider it in its various &s;ta|ges and circum&s;tances, agreeably to that varie|ty which there is in the circum&s;tances and at|tainments of chri&s;tians. But is it not a ju&s;t objection to this performance, if there are many chri&s;tians who are con&s;cious to them|&s;elves
<PB N="228" REF="025154_0226_0FCE741F07A46BC0">
that the foundation of their religious temper and practice was not laid in tho&s;e prin|ciples and that view of things which you there de&s;cribe? Which I &s;uppo&s;e mu&s;t be the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who do not in a good degree embrace the Calvini&s;tical doctrines, and in &s;ome mea|&s;ure of many that do: for I am inclined to think, that different principles do not more variou&s;ly affect and influence the minds of men, than the &s;ame principles do different minds, e&s;pecially young ones, according to the firmne&s;s or weakne&s;s of the mind, or as the prevailing turn is &s;prightly or melan|choly. Con&s;idering, therefore, the &s;tate of the chri&s;tian church univer&s;ally, may it not be rea&s;onable to allow a greater variety in the me|thods, which divine wi&s;dom and mercy take, to bring &s;inful men to the love and practice of religion? You will ob&s;erve, the objection does not infer, that the method you pre&s;cribe is not the mo&s;t general, or the be&s;t adapted to be|gin and carry on the chri&s;tian life in the &s;oul of man, but whether it be the only one.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If I might venture to add another remark, it &s;hould be this: whether your rules and di|rections for promoting the chri&s;tian life do not require more time to be &s;pent in the ex|erci&s;e of devotion and in the in&s;trumental du|ties of religion, than is con&s;i&s;tent with that attention to the affairs of this life, which is nece&s;&s;ary for the generality of chri&s;tians; and whether the propo&s;ing more to be done than can (from a view of the capacities and op|portunities of chri&s;tians in general) be ex|pected
<PB N="229" REF="025154_0227_0FCE7420847CF4D0">
&s;hould be done, may not di&s;courage &s;ome not to attempt, and others not to proceed in a cour&s;e of religion? What is fit to be done by &s;ome per&s;ons, and in &s;ome &s;pecial circum|&s;tances, may not be expected from the greater number of chri&s;tians: and care &s;hould be tak|en, that the heights of piety, to which &s;ome devout &s;ouls have &s;oared, do not become mat|ter of di&s;couragement to young chri&s;tians, or tho&s;e of an ordinary rank.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is not improbable that I, who read over this book with a view and de&s;ire to di&s;cover and amend my own faults, and not to find any in that, may not have &s;ufficiently attended to &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages that may &s;how both the&s;e re|marks impertinent; or if there are not &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages in this book, I my&s;elf can point out to &s;ome in other of your pieces (particularly that on Regeneration, if my memory does not greatly fail me) which guard again&s;t both the&s;e objections in very clear and expre&s;s terms. But whatever be the fate of my remarks, when I venture to attack the accuracy of your compo|&s;itions, I have a &s;ure and tried retreat in the candour and benevolence of your di&s;po&s;ition, which conceals all the weakne&s;&s;es of your friends; and, I &s;peak it from my own repeat|ed experience, magnifies any well-intentioned attempt into an act or evidence of con&s;picuous wi&s;dom or virtue.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 364&mdash;366.</NOTE></P>

<P>Dr. Doddridge's next appearance from the pre&s;s was, likewi&s;e, in a funeral di&s;cour&s;e, which was preached at Northampton, in May, 1746, on occa&s;ion of the death of the Rev. Mr. James Shepherd. Mr. Shepherd was a worthy young mini&s;ter, not quite twenty-two years of age, who died, in con&s;equence of a &s;hort illne&s;s, &s;oon after he had fini&s;hed his academical &s;tudies, and had received an invitation to the pa&s;toral charge of a di&s;&s;enting congregation at Cogge&s;hall, in E&s;&s;ex. Nine &s;ermons, the whole which he had ever

made, were collected together, and printed in a &s;mall volume, 1748.</P>
<P>In 1747, Dr. Doddridge, agreeably to the promi&s;e he had before made, publi&s;hed "Some remarkable pa&s;&s;ages in the Life of the Hon. Col. James Gardiner;" a work which has gone thro' various editions. It was the author's de&s;ign, in this work, not merely to perform a tribute of gratitude to the memory of an invaluable friend, but of duty to GOD and his fellow-creatures; as he had a cheerful hope that the narrative would, under the divine ble&s;&s;ing, be the means of &s;preading a warm and lively &s;en&s;e of religion. Several of the Doctor's literary corre&s;pondents thought highly of the performance. "I own," &s;ays Mr. Barker,
<Q>I was not without my fears, le&s;t your love to that excellent per&s;on &s;hould have overcharged &s;ome of your pa&s;&s;ages with panegyric; and the extraordinary manner of his conver&s;ion have given &s;ome occa&s;ion to the pre&s;ent age to charge him or you with enthu|&s;ia&s;m. But in reading the book I was agree|ably &s;urpri&s;ed and exceedingly plea&s;ed; and have the &s;atisfaction to acquaint you, that your friends here are of opinion that you have per|formed what you have undertaken in a mo&s;t excellent manner, and that it is &s;uited to do a great deal of good.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letters, ubi &s;upra, p. 109, 110.</NOTE></Q> Mr. Neal, who wrote to the author before he had read the whole work, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the following terms.
<Q>The receipt of Colonel Gardiner's Life calls upon me for a particular acknowledgment. I have yet only had the plea&s;ure of reading &s;ome part
<PB N="233" REF="025154_0231_0FCE742905DFD478">
of it; and though I know you would rather &s;ee me improved by it, than hear me commend it, yet as the latter will, I hope, be no ob&s;truc|tion to the former, I mu&s;t own that, as far as I have gone, I think it is writen in a very in|&s;tructive and entertaining manner; and I was charmed with the dedication, the concluding period of which is worthy the eloquence and politene&s;s of Pliny, and the piety and energy of St. Paul. But I will &s;ay no more till I have peru&s;ed the whole piece.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 370.</NOTE></P>
<P>Perhaps it may be thought &s;omewhat remark|able, that the learned Warburton &s;hould expre&s;s the mo&s;t unqualified approbation of the whole work. "I had the favour," &s;ays this eminent writer,
<Q>of your letter, and along with it Colo|nel Gardiner's life, which I have ju&s;t read through with very great plea&s;ure. Nothing can be better or more judicious than the writing part. Many con&s;iderations made the &s;ubject of great importance and expediency. The celebration of worthy men who &s;acrificed them&s;elves for the &s;ervice of their country; the tribute paid to private friend&s;hip; the ex|ample, particularly to the &s;oldiery, of &s;o much virtue and piety, as well as courage and patri|oti&s;m; the &s;ervice done to the &s;urvivors of their families, are &s;uch important con&s;idera|tions as equally concern the writer and the public. I had a thou&s;and things to remark in it which gave me plea&s;ure. But I have room but for two or three. The di&s;tinction you &s;ettle between piety and enthu&s;ia&s;m in the 78th

Nor am I le&s;s plea&s;ed with your ob&s;ervations on the <HI>mu|tilated form of chri&s;tianity,</HI> in the 130th page: we &s;ee the terrible effects of it. The &s;ame plea&s;ure your 162d and 163d pages afforded me. Your hymns are truly pious and poetical. The note at the bottom of page 176 is fine. I entirely agree with your &s;entiments con|cerning the extraordinary circum&s;tance of the good man's conver&s;ion.

<P>The chief ob&s;ervation that Mr. Orton makes on the work is, that
<Q>the author had the plea|&s;ure to hear of &s;ome in&s;tances in which it had an&s;wered his de&s;ires and hopes; though many thought, and perhaps ju&s;tly, that he too much indulged the emotions of private friend|&s;hip and affection in the compo&s;ition.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 114.</NOTE> In the truth of this remark I entirely concur. Co|lonel Gardiner was indeed a man of a mo&s;t ex|cellent character; but that character was tinc|tured with enthu&s;ia&s;m and religious bigotry. His virtues were of the awful kind. I remem|ber well that his a&s;pect was the a&s;pect of dig|nity; but this dignity was mixed with an au|&s;terity of appearance and manner, which was not prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing to the minds of the &s;tudents belonging to the academy at Northampton.

The affection of his elde&s;t &s;on to his father, had, I know, more of fear united with it than is u&s;ually de&s;irable in a child towards a parent. Dr. Dod|dridge undoubtedly went too far, when, in his funeral &s;ermon for Colonel Gardiner, he deli|berately declared, that it was hard for him to &s;ay where, but in the book of GOD, the Colonel <HI>found his example,</HI> or where he had <HI>left his equal.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doddridge's Sermons, and religious Tracts, Vol. III. p. 62.</NOTE> The Doctor was him&s;elf a &s;uperior character.

<P>It is not my de&s;ign to enter &s;pecifically into the &s;tory of Colonel Gardiner's extraordinary conver&s;ion. That the impre&s;&s;ion made upon his mind was in a dream, is &s;ufficiently intima|ted to be the opinion of Dr. Doddridge, though the Colonel him&s;elf believed it to be a miracu|lous vi&s;ion. As a dream it may very rationally be accounted for, from the predi&s;po&s;ing circum|&s;tances. He had received a &s;trictly pious edu|cation; he had never rejected the principles, though he had departed from the practice of chri&s;tianity; he often felt the angui&s;h of his cour&s;e of life; he was alone, in the &s;olemn &s;till|ne&s;s of the night; a religious book happened to be opened by him; the dreadful crime in which he was going to engage fla&s;hed upon his con|&s;cience. Falling a&s;leep in this agitation of his &s;pirits, a dream followed, accommodated to his waking reflections. Nor was he, on this ac|count, the le&s;s indebted to the goodne&s;s of Di|vine

Providence for the happy and effectual change that was produced in his di&s;po&s;ition and conduct.

This volume is a very valuable part of Dr. Doddridge's great work; being executed with &s;ingular attention and diligence, and comprehending a large va|riety of curious and important critical remarks, together with excellent practical ob&s;ervations. In &s;everal momentous particulars he differed from Lord Barrington and Dr. Ben&s;on, and co|incided in opinion with Dr. Lardner.

<Q>You have happily

But, at the &s;ame time, he gladly embraced the opportunity of paying him a very fine compliment. "I cannot," &s;ays the Doctor,
<Q>&s;et my&s;elf to this ta&s;k, without feeling the fatigue of it &s;en|&s;ibly allayed, by the plea&s;ure with which I reflect on the firm per&s;ua&s;ion which a per&s;on of his unequalled &s;agacity mu&s;t have enter|tained of the truth of chri&s;tianity, in order to his being engaged to take &s;uch pains in illu&s;trating the &s;acred oracles. A plea&s;ure, which I doubt not every good reader will &s;hare with me; e&s;pecially as (accord|ing to the be&s;t information, whether public or private, I could ever get) his firm faith in the divine revelation di&s;covered it&s;elf in the mo&s;t genuine fruits of &s;ub&s;tantial virtue and piety; and con&s;equently gives us the ju&s;te&s;t rea&s;on to conclude, that he is now re|joicing

in the happy effects of it infinitely more than in all the applau&s;e which his phi|lo&s;ophical works have procured him; though they have commanded a fame la&s;ting as the world, the true theory of which he had di&s;co|vered, and (in &s;pite of all the vain efforts of ignorance, pride, and their offspring bigotry) have arrayed him as it were in the beams of the &s;un, and in&s;cribed his name among the con&s;tellations of heaven.</Q>
Concerning Dr. Doddridge's Di&s;&s;ertation on the In&s;piration of the Old Te&s;tament, Warburton pronounced, that it is a well rea&s;oned and judicious perform|ance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;upra, p. 20<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> Perhaps in &s;ome re&s;pects the rea&s;oning may be rather too hypothetical; but, on the whole, it is a production which abounds with important and u&s;eful ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The only &s;ermon publi&s;hed by Dr. Doddridge in 1748, was one entitled, "Chri&s;t's Invitation to thir&s;ty Souls." It had been preached nearly twenty years before at Northampton, and was now printed at the reque&s;t of a worthy member of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, to whom it had been communicated in the intimacy of friend&s;hip. Prefixed to it is a dedication, of con&s;iderable length, to the Rev. James Harvey. This cir|cum&s;tance, if I conjecture rightly, did not plea&s;e the &s;trong-minded Warburton. "I think," &s;ays he,

<P>The fir&s;t publication of Dr. Doddridge in 1749 was,
<Q>A plain and &s;erious Addre&s;s to a Ma&s;ter of a Family on the important Subject of Family Religion.</Q>

either morning or evening, with &s;uch variations as might ea&s;ily be under&s;tood by any who were able to read it. The Doctor, though a di&s;&s;ent|er, and him&s;elf excelling in the variety and co|piou&s;ne&s;s of more extemporaneous adorations, was not, we &s;ee, aver&s;e to forms of prayer on proper occa&s;ions. Indeed, he recommends them in his "Addre&s;s," the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, affection, and momentous nature of which entitle it to great attention and regard. The next appear|ance of our author from the pre&s;s was in a di&s;|cour&s;e that had been preached at Northampton on the twenty-fifth of April, 1749; being the day appointed by his Maje&s;ty for a general thank&s;giving on account of the peace concluded with France and Spain. It was entitled,
<Q>Re|flections on the Conduct of Divine Provi|dence in the Series and Conclu&s;ion of the late War,</Q>
and contains many beautiful and im|portant ob&s;ervations, adapted to the circum&s;tances of the time.</P>
<P>In 1749-50, Dr. Doddridge preached, at a meeting of mini&s;ters at Creaton in Northamp|ton&s;hire, and afterwards publi&s;hed a &s;ermon, the title of which is,
<Q>Chri&s;tian Candour and Una|nimity &s;tated, illu&s;trated, and urged.</Q>

<P>On the twentieth of Augu&s;t, 1750, Dr. Dod|dridge preached a &s;ermon at Salter's-Hall, on oc|ca&s;ion of the late alarm by the &s;econd &s;hock of an earthquake, which had happened on the eighth of March preceding. The di&s;cour&s;e being de|livered
<PB N="242" REF="025154_0240_0FCE743C2F4F6B70">
to a very large and attentive auditory, it was earne&s;tly reque&s;ted that it might be printed; and accordingly it appeared under the title of
<Q>The Guilt and Doom of Capernaum &s;eriou&s;ly recommended to the Con&s;ideration of the In|habitants of London.</Q>
Both the &s;ermon and the preface amply &s;how how &s;olicitous our au|thor was, with many other good men, to im|prove every event of Divine Providence to the be&s;t of purpo&s;es. In the December of the &s;ame year, he was called upon to pay the la&s;t tribute of re&s;pect to the memory of his friend and father, Dr. Clark. That gentleman died on the fourth of the month, and on the &s;ixteenth Dr. Dod|dridge preached his funeral &s;ermon at St. Alban's. The di&s;cour&s;e is entitled,
<Q>Meditations on the Tears of Je&s;us over the Grave of Lazarus;</Q>
and the character given of Dr. Clark is as ju&s;t as it is affectionate. It may not be improper to mention, that Dr. Clark was the author of a collection of Scripture Promi&s;es, which has been very u&s;eful to many pious chri&s;tians, and of three excellent Sermons, on the Nature and Cau&s;es of Irre&s;olution in Religion, printed in 1742. As a proof of the liberality of his mind, I &s;hall tran|&s;cribe a pa&s;&s;age from one of his letters, written in 1727, to Mr. Doddridge.
<Q>You have &s;een, I &s;uppo&s;e, what the public prints inform us of, relating to the proceedings of the General A&s;&s;embly in Scotland, again&s;t Mr. Patrick Simp&s;on. They are going to deprive that church of one of the mo&s;t valuable per&s;ons in it, becau&s;e he does not think it nece&s;&s;ary to tie him&s;elf down exactly to their Shibboleth, nor
<PB N="243" REF="025154_0241_0FCE743DA9FB0648">
oblige him&s;elf to conform to all the &s;chola&s;tic ways of &s;peaking, concerning &s;ome things, about which the &s;cripture is &s;ilent. By what I &s;aw and heard of him when in Scotland, he is a much better judge of tho&s;e matters than the greater part of tho&s;e who are to judge him. His crime is, that he is di&s;po&s;ed to think for him&s;elf; but yet he is very cautious to avoid giving offence, which I perceive is, by the bigots, interpreted cunning and di&s;&s;imulation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>One would think the experience of &s;o many ages &s;hould be &s;ufficient to make the world wi&s;er; and that tho&s;e who pretend to govern in the church &s;hould learn at la&s;t that their power might be much better exerci&s;ed, than in de&s;troying the u&s;efulne&s;s of the be&s;t men in it, merely for nice &s;peculations about unreveal|ed or di&s;putable points. Suppo&s;e a per&s;on &s;hould not &s;peak with exact propriety, con|cerning the manner of Chri&s;t's exi&s;tence, a point &s;o much above our reach, if yet he loves him, tru&s;ts in him, and &s;incerely obeys him, what harm does religion &s;uffer by it? But I need not enlarge upon this to you, who are &s;o well in&s;tructed in the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of bigotry to a &s;et of &s;peculative notions.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters to and from the Rev.

<P>I have now &s;pecified the works that were pub|li&s;hed by Dr. Doddridge during his life time, in their chronological order, which has been ne|glected by Mr. Orton, and very much confound|ed in the three volumes containing the Doctor's Sermons and religious Tracts. Such of his wri|tings as were printed after his decea&s;e will here|after
<PB N="244" REF="025154_0242_0FCE74400730D9D0">
be mentioned; and, therefore, it only re|mains at pre&s;ent to be added, that he was the author of a few &s;mall pieces which appeared in other collections. The&s;e were, &s;ome papers, when he was a young man, in "The pre&s;ent State of the Republic of Letters;" a recommen|datory Preface to a performance, entitled,
<Q>Fa|miliar Dialogues for Children;</Q>
a biographi|cal Preface to twelve Sermons, by the Rev. Thomas Steffe, a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter and former pupil, who died in early life, at Taunton in Somer&s;et&s;hire; an elaborate account, in
<Q>The Hi&s;tory of the Works of the Learned,</Q>
of the &s;econd volume of Warburton's divine Legation of Mo&s;es; and an elegant practical Paraphra&s;e of the la&s;t Words of David, according to the criti|cal interpretation of Dr. Richard Grey, of Hin|ton, Northampton&s;hire.</P>
<P>I ought to have taken notice under the pro|per year (1748) that Dr. Doddridge revi&s;ed the "Expo&s;itory Works" and other remains of Arch|bi&s;hop Leighton, and tran&s;lated his "Latin Pre|lections." The&s;e were printed together at Edin|burgh, in two volumes. Though the preparing of the&s;e volumes for the pre&s;s took up &s;ome of the Doctor's time for &s;everal months, in the in|tervals of other bu&s;ine&s;s, he was far from repent|ing of his labour. The delight and edification which he found in the writings of this extraor|dinary man, were e&s;teemed by him to be a full equivalent for his pains; &s;eparately from all the pro&s;pect of that effect which they might have upon others. He acknowledges in his preface, that he never &s;pent a quarter of an hour in re|viewing
<PB N="245" REF="025154_0243_0FCE7443AFE04190">
any of them, without feeling, amid&s;t the interruption which a critical examination of the copy would naturally give, &s;ome impre&s;&s;ions which he wi&s;hed always to retain. Indeed, he found in them &s;uch heart-affecting le&s;&s;ons of &s;implicity and humility, candour and benevo|lence, and of exalted piety, without the lea&s;t tincture of enthu&s;ia&s;m, as he thought could &s;carcely be equalled any where el&s;e, excepting in the &s;acred Oracles.*</P>
<P>Dr. Henry Miles, of Tooting, &s;peaking of Archbi&s;hop Leighton's works, &s;aid, in a letter to Dr. Doddridge,
<Q>I ble&s;s GOD I ever met with them. There is a &s;pirit in them I never met with in any human writings, nor can I read many lines in them without being affected: though you know all his works are imperfect and inaccurate.</Q>&dagger; Scotland, in the middle of the la&s;t century, produced &s;ome divines, who had imbibed, in a wonderful manner, the genu|ine &s;pirit of devotion, and the genuine &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity. The name of Scougal will occur to every one who is tolerably acquaint|ed either with the hi&s;tory of theology, or with compo&s;itions of a practical nature.</P>
<P>The journey which Dr. Doddridge took to St. Alban's for the purpo&s;e of preaching Dr. Clark's funeral &s;ermon, laid the foundation of his own death. In that journey, which, as we have &s;een before, was in December, 1750, he unhappily contracted a cold, that hung upon him during the remainder of the winter. When the &s;pring advanced, the di&s;order con&s;iderably abated; but in the &s;ummer it returned again
<PB N="246" REF="025154_0244_0FCE74452F9B1688">
with great violence. In this &s;tate of his health, he was advi&s;ed by his phy&s;icians and friends to lay a&s;ide his public work for a time, and to ap|ply him&s;elf to the u&s;e of proper medicines and exerci&s;e for the removal of his complaint. With the former part of this advice he could not be prevailed upon to comply; for, in his e&s;tima|tion, to be u&s;ele&s;s was wor&s;e than death. Whil&s;t he apprehended that there was no immediate danger, he could not be induced to decline, or even to le&s;&s;en, the various &s;acred employments in which he &s;o much delighted; and he was particularly de&s;irous to complete the fair tran|&s;cript of his Family Expo&s;itor. The nearer he approached to his di&s;&s;olution, the more plainly was ob&s;erved his continual improvement in a &s;piritual and heavenly temper. Indeed, he &s;eemed to have gotten above the world, and to be daily breathing after immortality. This di&s;|po&s;ition of his mind was ardently expre&s;&s;ed in &s;everal of his letters, and is manife&s;t from his will, which was made at this time, and is pre|faced in the following language:
<Q>Whereas it is cu&s;tomary on the&s;e occa&s;ions to begin with commending the &s;oul into the hands of GOD through Chri&s;t; I do it, not in mere form, but with &s;incerity and joy; e&s;teeming it my greate&s;t happine&s;s, that I am taught and en|couraged to do it, by that glorious go&s;pel, which, having mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly believed, I have &s;pent my life in preaching to others; and which I e&s;teem an infinitely greater trea&s;ure than all my little worldly &s;tore, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions ten thou&s;and times greater than mine.</Q>*</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="025154_0245_0FCE7446E478D290">The la&s;t time that Dr. Doddridge admini&s;ter|ed the Lord's Supper to his congregation at Northampton, was on the &s;econd of June, 1751. In the &s;ermon which he delivered previou&s;ly to the celebration of the ordinance, and which was from Hebrews xii.23, he expatiated on the illu&s;|trious and innumerable a&s;&s;embly that would meet together in the cele&s;tial world; and in the conclu&s;ion of the whole &s;ervice, he mentioned, with marks of uncommon plea&s;ure, the authori|ty of Chri&s;t over mini&s;ters and churches. He dropped, likewi&s;e, &s;ome hints of his approaching decea&s;e, and &s;poke with great tenderne&s;s and af|fection to his people on the pro&s;pect of their fi|nal &s;eparation. After this he &s;pent &s;ome weeks in London, where the hurries and fatigues he went through contributed to increa&s;e his di&s;or|der. On his return from the metropolis, which was nearly the middle of July, he determined, notwith&s;tanding the earne&s;t entreaties of his friends to the contrary, to addre&s;s his flock once more from the pulpit. The di&s;cour&s;e, which proved in fact to be his farewel &s;ermon, was from Romans xiv.8, and was well adapted, not only to the &s;tate of his congregation, but to that of his pupils, for who&s;e future improvement and welfare he was tenderly concerned.</P>
<P>The la&s;t public &s;ervice, in which Dr. Dod|dridge was ever engaged, was on the eighteenth of July, at the ordination of the Rev. Mr. Adams, at Bewdley, in Worce&s;ter&s;hire. How unfit he was at this time for taking any part in the duties of the day, was di&s;played in his pale countenance, and in his languid, trembling
<PB N="248" REF="025154_0246_0FCE744B54E39090">
voice; but he had promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and was unwilling to be ab&s;ent or unemployed on the occa&s;ion. From Bewdley he went to Shrew&s;bury, where he re&s;ided &s;everal weeks, at the hou&s;e of his friend Mr. Orton, for the convenience of air, exerci&s;e, and an entire rece&s;s from bu&s;ine&s;s and company. By this retirement he &s;eemed to be a little recruited. Whil&s;t he was at Shrew&s;bury, he received many letters from his friends, expre&s;&s;ive of their high e&s;teem and affection for him, and of their deep concern for his dangerous illne&s;s.* A very pathetic one, written by Mr. Neal, will be found in the col|lection lately publi&s;hed. Part of what he wrote is as follows:
<Q>You may be &s;ure, we are all greatly affected with the danger that threatens a life &s;o univer&s;ally de&s;irable, and to us &s;o pe|culiarly endeared: and our invaluable friend <HI>(Mr. Barker)</HI> di&s;&s;olved not only us, but great part of his numerous audience, into tears, by a kind of in&s;pired eloquence, with which he offered up &s;trong pleas and cries, for your &s;up|port and revival, to him who is able to deliver from death.&mdash;My dear friend, I be&s;eech you not to think of returning to Northampton, even though you &s;hould receive all imaginable benefit at Shrew&s;bury in the en&s;uing fortnight, till you have vi&s;ited Bri&s;tol; and in preparing for that expedition, I conceive no time &s;hould be lo&s;t, as the &s;ea&s;on for the waters, as well as of the year, is &s;o far advanced. I &s;hould tremble for your return to Northampton at pre&s;ent, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome encouraging

Speaking of the academy, Mr. Neal adds,
<Q>Mr. Clark, I am per&s;uaded, is able to do what is fully &s;ufficient, and will be very acceptable to the tru&s;tees. And I rejoice in his ability (which I do not at all di&s;tru&s;t) to keep the pupils very profitably employed for &s;ome time; though I &s;hould much rather hear the academy was all di&s;banded, than that you &s;hould read a &s;ingle lecture between this and Michaelmas.

<Q>Le&s;|&s;ingham, Neal, and Barker, are too nearly intere&s;ted in that precious life, which now appears in danger of being cut off in the mid&s;t of its days, to hear of its wa&s;te and langui&s;h|ing without great concern and fervent prayer to GOD.

<P>Dr. Doddridge was &s;o deeply affected with the friend&s;hip expre&s;&s;ed in this letter, and the divine con&s;olations which it admini&s;tered, that there was rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive that his tender frame would have &s;unk under the emotions of his gratitude and joy.</P>
<P>In autumn, his phy&s;icians judged it proper that he &s;hould make a trial of the waters of Bri&s;tol; and accordingly he went thither in the month of Augu&s;t. Upon his arrival at that place, a wor|thy clergyman of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, with whom he had only a &s;light acquaintance, enter|tained him in the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable manner and with a fraternal affection, till he could be accom|odated with &s;uitable apartments near the wells; and Dr. Maddox, Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, paid him a friendly vi&s;it, and, in very obliging terms, of|fered to convey him in his chariot, at the &s;tated times of drinking the water. Little hope of his deriving benefit from it was given him by the phy&s;icians at Bri&s;tol; and he received their report of the great hazard of his ca&s;e with a fortitude, re&s;ignation, and cheerfulne&s;s, which never for|&s;ook him to the la&s;t, in any place, or on any oc|ca&s;ion.
<PB N="254" REF="025154_0252_0FCE7457E8435F80">
Here he met with &s;everal of his friends, who were de&s;irous to do all in their power to te&s;tify their regard for him; and offers of &s;ervice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance were made to him by &s;trangers, and even by per&s;ons who had formerly conceiv|ed prejudices again&s;t him. A worthy nobleman intere&s;ted him&s;elf as kindly about the Doctor's health, as if he had long been his intimate friend. Whil&s;t Dr. Doddridge was at Bri&s;tol, he was vi&s;ited by &s;ome of the principal people of his congregation, who expre&s;&s;ed an affection for him not to be de&s;cribed, and who brought with them a&s;&s;urances of the &s;ame affection from the re&s;t of his flock, and of their ardent and repeat|ed prayers for his recovery. This new proof of their regard afforded him great &s;atisfaction and refre&s;hment. He was directed by his phy&s;icians to &s;peak and write as little as po&s;&s;ible; but he could not content him&s;elf without &s;ometimes &s;ending letters, in &s;hort-hand, to a few cho&s;en friends, expre&s;&s;ive of the excellent frame of his mind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 277&mdash;281</NOTE></P>
<P>The health of Dr. Doddridge continuing &s;till more and more to decline, he was advi&s;ed, as the la&s;t re&s;ort in &s;o threatening a di&s;order, to remove to a warmer climate for the winter. It was propo&s;ed that he &s;hould go to Li&s;bon. In deliberating upon this &s;cheme, his principal ob|jection to it was the great expen&s;e with which the execution of it would nece&s;&s;arily be attended. He doubted whether, with &s;o very precarious a hope of its being beneficial to him, he ought to pur&s;ue the de&s;ign; when his family, which, in

ca&s;e of his decea&s;e, would be but &s;lenderly provi|ded for, would be con&s;iderably injured by the voyage. "It will," &s;ays Mr. Orton,
<Q>I hope, appear to every con&s;iderate reader, a glorious circum&s;tance in the Doctor's life, that it was &s;acrificed to the generous, di&s;intere&s;ted &s;ervice of his great Ma&s;ter, and benevolence to man|kind; that, with the advantage of a genius and qualifications equal to the highe&s;t advance|ment in the e&s;tabli&s;hment, and without being chargeable with want of economy, he &s;hould find him&s;elf under the painful nece&s;&s;ity of pre|&s;erving the little remainder of his life, by an expen&s;e di&s;proportionate to the provi&s;ion made for his family, dear to him as his own life.</Q>
There happened to be at Bri&s;tol a clergyman of the church of England, who had not been previ|ou&s;ly acquainted with Dr. Doddridge, but who behaved to him in the kinde&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pect|ful manner. In conver&s;ation with this gentle|man, the Doctor unde&s;ignedly threw out a hint of the principal rea&s;on which cau&s;ed him to de|mur about the voyage. The benevolent cler|gyman immediately &s;eized the hint, and took an opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing, before a lady of con&s;iderable fortune, who was a di&s;&s;enter, his e&s;teem and re&s;pect for the Doctor, and the con|cern it gave him, that a per&s;on who did &s;o much honour to chri&s;tianity in general, and to his own den<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mination in particular, and who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s he was plea&s;ed to expre&s;s him&s;elf)

<PB N="256" REF="025154_0254_0FCE745D44D672F8">
from taking a &s;tep, on which perhaps his life depended. He added, that, in his opinion, it would be an everla&s;ting reproach upon the di&s;|&s;enters as a body, if tho&s;e who knew of his &s;itu|ation did not take &s;ome &s;peedy and vigorous mea&s;ures to remove the difficulty. No &s;ooner had this gentleman given the hint, and &s;et a hand&s;ome precedent, than it was cheerfully pur|&s;ued; and the genero&s;ity of Dr. Doddridge's ac|quaintance at Bri&s;tol and in other places, fully equalled his wants and his wi&s;hes. Mr. Neal was particularly active in the management of the affair, and had the plea&s;ure of informing the Doctor, that in&s;tead of &s;elling what our au|thor had in the funds, he &s;hould be able, through the benevolence of friends, to add &s;omething to it, after the expen&s;e of the voyage was defrayed.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Dr. Doddridge continued at Bri&s;tol, and his journey was in pro&s;pect, many other plea&s;ing circum&s;tances occurred, which tended to lighten his affliction. A &s;ervant, in particu|lar, of the family where he lodged, offered her|&s;elf to attend him to Li&s;bon on very rea&s;onable terms; a propo&s;al which was the more &s;ea&s;ona|ble and acceptable, as infirm per&s;ons, who de&s;igned the &s;ame voyage, u&s;ually found it ex|tremely difficult to procure &s;uch attendance, even by large offers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p 281&mdash;287</NOTE> Dr. Oliver was at no &s;mall pains to prepare every thing for making the journey as comfortable as po&s;&s;ible; and Mr. Warburton prevailed upon the &s;ecretary of the Po&s;t-Office to write to the captain of the packet-boat at Falmouth, to engage him to
<PB N="257" REF="025154_0255_0FCE745EB13F0288">
give Dr. Doddridge the be&s;t accommodations in his power.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letters, ubi &s;upra, p. 264.</NOTE> On the &s;eventeenth of September the Doctor left Bri&s;tol, and after a fatiguing journey of ten days, occa&s;ioned partly by the badne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on and roads, and partly by his great weakne&s;s, he arrived at Falmouth. There he was received in the kinde&s;t manner by Dr. Turner, the phy&s;ician of the place, who gen|erou&s;ly entertained him in his hou&s;e, and recom|mended him to the care of his nephew, Dr. Cantley, at Li&s;bon. During Dr. Doddridge's journey and &s;tay at Falmouth; his mo&s;t painful and threatening &s;ymptoms had been &s;u&s;pended; but, on the night before he &s;ailed, they returned with greater violence than ever. Mrs. Dod|dridge, therefore, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to pro|po&s;e, that he &s;hould either return home, or &s;tay a while longer at Falmouth. Having, however, &s;ome hope from a change of climate, he gave this &s;hort an&s;wer, "The die is ca&s;t, and I choo&s;e to go."</P>
<P>The propriety of Dr. Doddridge's voyage to Li&s;bon has by &s;ome per&s;ons been doubted; but in this undertaking he acted by the unanimous advice of the mo&s;t competent judges. At Fal|mouth much civility was &s;hewn him by &s;everal of the inhabitants of the place, to whom his friends had written for that purpo&s;e, and he parted from them with the utmo&s;t gratitude and tenderne&s;s. On Monday the thirtieth of Sep|tember he went on board the packet; and as the captain of it did not happen to go the voyage, the Doctor had the convenience of his cabin,
<PB N="258" REF="025154_0256_0FCE7460EB8DF6A0">
which was no &s;mall comfort and advantage to him in his weak condition. Upon the &s;ailing of the ve&s;&s;el, the new &s;cene which opened upon him, and the &s;oft air and fre&s;h breezes of the &s;ea, had the mo&s;t plea&s;ing effect on his &s;pirits. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">ne&s;s was &s;everely felt by Mrs. Dod|dridge and the &s;ervant; but happily he him&s;elf did not &s;uffer from it; &s;o that he needed their attendance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance le&s;s than before. He generally &s;at, the greate&s;t part of the day, in an ea&s;y chair, in the captain's cabin; and his mind was admirably &s;u&s;tained by delightful views of the heavenly world. Such &s;acred gratitude and joy appeared in his countenance, as often bro't to the remembrance of his lady the following lines in one of his hymns:
<Q><L>When Death o'er Nature &s;hall prevail,</L>
<L>And all the powers of language fail,</L>
<L>Joy through my &s;wimming eyes &s;hall break,</L>
<L>And <HI>mean</HI> the thanks I cannot &s;peak.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the Bay of Bi&s;cay the ve&s;&s;el was unhappily becalmed for &s;ome days; and the weather prov|ed &s;o inten&s;ely hot, that Dr. Doddridge's col|liquative &s;weats returned, attended with a faint|ne&s;s that threatened his &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution. Pro|vidence, however, &s;till lengthened out the feeble thread of life. When the &s;hip came to the de|&s;ired haven, and was waiting for the u&s;ual cere|monies of entrance, the finene&s;s of the day, the &s;oftne&s;s of the air, and the delightful pro&s;pects by which he was &s;urrounded, gave him a fre&s;h flow of &s;trength and &s;pirits. He &s;tayed upon
<PB N="259" REF="025154_0257_0FCE74679643A560">
deck about two hours, and derived from it &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible degree of refre&s;hment, as to rai&s;e even a flattering hope of his recovery. On Sunday the thirteenth of October he landed at Li&s;bon. The next day he wrote to his a&s;&s;i&s;tant at North|ampton, giving him a &s;hort account of his voyage, of the magnificent appearance which the city made from the &s;ea, and of what he ob&s;erved in pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treets. After mentioning his great weakne&s;s and danger, he added,
<Q>Ne|verthele&s;s, I ble&s;s GOD, the mo&s;t undi&s;turbed &s;erenity continues in my mind, and my &s;trength holds proportion to my day. I &s;till hope and tru&s;t in GOD, and joyfully acquie&s;ce in all he may do with me. When you &s;ee my dear friends of the congregation, inform them of my circum&s;tances, and a&s;&s;ure them, that I cheerfully &s;ubmit my&s;elf to GOD. If I de&s;ire life may be re&s;tored, it is chiefly that it may be employed in &s;erving Chri&s;t among them; and that I am enabled by faith to look upon death as an enemy that &s;hall be de&s;troyed; and can cheerfully leave my dear Mrs. Dod|dridge a widow in a &s;trange land, if &s;uch be the appointment of our heavenly Father.

<P>At Li&s;bon, Dr. Doddridge was kindly receiv|ed and entertained at the hou&s;e of Mr. David King, an Engli&s;h merchant, who&s;e mother was one of the Doctor's congregation, and who had now an opportunity he could never have expect|ed, but which he gladly embraced, of repaying
<PB N="260" REF="025154_0258_0FCE74691E8D3E48">
the many &s;ervices that had been done for his re|lations at Northampton. In this worthy fami|ly our author found the mo&s;t cordial friend&s;hip, and every accommodation that could tend to al|leviate his di&s;order. Here he happened to meet with Dr. Watts's Treati&s;e on the Happine&s;s of &s;eparate Spirits, which, being a work entirely coincident with his own &s;entiments, delighted him in a peculiar manner. In reading this book, Dr. Watts's Hymns, and e&s;pecially the Scrip|tures, he employed as much time as his &s;trength would admit. At Li&s;bon he found a family re|lated to Mrs. Doddridge, as well as other kind friends, who, either from a knowledge of his character, or from having received voluntary let|ters of recommendation, &s;hewed him all the ci|vility in their power, and indeed &s;eemed to &s;trive who &s;hould mo&s;t excel in di&s;playing for him an a&s;&s;iduous and tender regard. From their com|pany he derived plea&s;ure, though it was attended with the painful circum&s;tance of his not being able to conver&s;e with them as freely as he could have wi&s;hed to have done. The Rev. Mr. Wil|liam&s;on in particular, then chaplain to the Bri|ti&s;h factory, frequently vi&s;ited him, with the temper and behaviour of the gentleman, the chri&s;tian, and the divine.</P>
<P>About a week after Dr. Doddridge's arrival, by the advice of his phy&s;ician, Dr. Cantley, who attended him without receiving the u&s;ual fees, he was removed into the country, a few miles from Li&s;bon. This, however, was productive of no advantage; for the rainy &s;ea&s;on, which in that climate u&s;ually &s;ets in about the latter end
<PB N="261" REF="025154_0259_0FCE7469EC70C138">
of October, came on with &s;uch uncommon vio|lence, as not only to preclude any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from air and exerci&s;e, but to add greatly to his com|plaints. On the twenty-fourth of October he was &s;eized with a colliquative diarrhoea, which &s;oon exhau&s;ted his little &s;trength. Neverthe|le&s;s, during the &s;ucceeding night, which &s;eemed the la&s;t of rational life, he pre&s;erved the &s;ame calmne&s;s, vigour, and joy of mind, which he had felt and expre&s;&s;ed through the whole of his ill|ne&s;s. The only pain he had in the thought of dying, was the fear of that grief and di&s;tre&s;s which Mrs. Doddridge would &s;uffer from his removal. To his children, his congregation, and his friends in general, he de&s;ired to be remembered in the mo&s;t affectionate manner; nor did he forget the family where he lodged, or his own &s;ervant, in the effu&s;ions of his pious benevolence. Many devout &s;entiments and a&s;|pirations were uttered by him; but Mrs. Dod|dridge's heart was too much affected with his approaching change, to be able to recollect them di&s;tinctly. On the following day he lay in a gentle do&s;e, in which be continued till an hour before his death. At the la&s;t &s;truggle he appear|ed re&s;tle&s;s, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ched &s;everal deep &s;ighs, &s;oon after which he obtained his relea&s;e. This event took place on Saturday the twenty-&s;ixth of Octo|ber, old &s;tile, about three o'clock in the morning: and though he died in a foreign land, and in a certain &s;en&s;e among &s;trangers, his decea&s;e was embalmed with many tears. Not only the prin|cipal gentlemen of the factory, but even their &s;ervants, manife&s;ted a high &s;en&s;e of Dr. Dod|dridge's
<PB N="262" REF="025154_0260_0FCE746B6F8BDC18">
worth, and of the greatne&s;s of the public lo&s;s. A circum&s;tance which afforded much &s;a|tisfaction to Mrs. Doddridge, and her Li&s;bon friends, was, that the Doctor, in his la&s;t &s;cenes, was not mole&s;ted by the officious zeal of any of the prie&s;ts of the church of Rome. Agreeably to the de&s;ire which he had expre&s;&s;ed before his death, his body was opened, when his lungs were found in &s;o ulcerated a &s;tate, that it appear|ed &s;urpri&s;ing to the phy&s;ician that his &s;peaking and breathing had not been far more difficult and pain|ful to him than in fact they were, even to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Dr. Doddridge had frequently expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h of being buried at his meeting place at Northampton, where his children and &s;o many of his congregation and friends were depo&s;ited. However, during his illne&s;s, he &s;poke of this as a matter quite indifferent to him; and, to avoid increa&s;ing the di&s;tre&s;s of his afflicted con|&s;ort, was de&s;irous of being interred wherever he &s;hould die. It was found, upon enquiry, that the removal of the body to England would oc|ca&s;ion a very large expen&s;e, and therefore it was judged mo&s;t prudent to decline it. According|ly, his remains were conveyed to the burying-ground belonging to the Briti&s;h factory at Li&s;|bon, with as much decency and re&s;pect as cir|cum&s;tances and the place would admit. The greater part of the gentlemen of the factory at|tended his funeral; and Mr. William&s;on, on the following Sunday, preached a &s;ermon, in which he gave him a high and honourable character, founded on what he had heard from many, of his worth, and on what he had him&s;elf &s;een, dur|ing

<P>Though Dr. Doddridge's congregation had not the melancholy &s;atisfaction of having him interred at his own meeting-hou&s;e, they erected in it a hand&s;ome monument to his memory, and made a generous pre&s;ent to his widow after her return.

<SALUTE>MY DEAR CHILDREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>How &s;hall I addre&s;s you under this awful and melancholy Provi|dence! I would fain &s;ay &s;omething to comfort you. And I hope GOD will enable me to &s;ay &s;omething that may alleviate your deep di&s;tre&s;s. I went out in a firm dependence that, if Infinite Wi&s;dom was plea&s;ed to call me out to duties and trials as yet unknown, he would grant me tho&s;e &s;u|perior aids of &s;trength that would &s;upport and keep me from fainting un|der them; per&s;uaded that there was no di&s;tre&s;s or &s;orrow, into which he could lead me, under which his gracious and all-&s;ufficient arm could not &s;upport me. He has not di&s;appointed me, nor &s;uffered the heart and eyes directed to him to fail. "GOD all-&s;ufficient, and my only hope," is my motto: let it be yours. Such, indeed, have I found him; and &s;uch, I verily believe, you will find him too in this time of deep di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear children, help me to prai&s;e him! Such &s;upports, &s;uch con&s;olations, &s;uch comforts, has he granted to the meane&s;t of his crea|tures, that my mind, at times, is held in perfect a&s;toni&s;hment, and is rea|dy to bur&s;t into &s;ongs of prai&s;e under its mo&s;t exqui&s;ite di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>As to outward comforts, GOD has withheld no good thing from me, but has given me all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and all the &s;upports, that the tendere&s;t friend&s;hip was capable of affording me, and which I think my dear North|ampton friends could not have exceeded. Their prayers are not lo&s;t. I doubt not but I am reaping the benefit of them, and hope that you will do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I am returned to good Mr. King's. Be good to poor Mrs. King. It is a debt of gratitude I owe for the great obligations I am under to that worthy family here. Such a &s;olicitude of friend&s;hip was &s;urely hardly ever known as I meet with here. I have the offers of friend&s;hip more than I can employ; and it gives a real concern to many here that they cannot find out a way to &s;erve me. The&s;e are great honours conferred on the dear decea&s;ed, and great comforts to me. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how much the&s;e mercies are endeared to me, as coming in &s;uch an immediate manner from the Divine Hand. To his name be the prai&s;e and glory of all!</P>
<P>And now, my dear children, what &s;hall I &s;ay to you? Ours is no common lo&s;s. I mourn the be&s;t of hu&s;bands and of friends, removed from this world of &s;in and &s;orrow to the regions of immortal bli&s;s and light. What a glory! What a mercy is it that I am enabled with my thoughts to pur&s;ue him there! You have lo&s;t the deare&s;t and be&s;t of par|ents, the guide of your youth! and who&s;e plea&s;ure it would have been to have introduced you into life with great advantages.</P>
<P>Our lo&s;s is great indeed! But I really think the lo&s;s the public has &s;u&s;tained is &s;till greater. But GOD can never want in&s;truments to carry on his work. Yet, let us be thankful that GOD ever gave us &s;uch a friend; that he has continued him &s;o long with us. Perhaps, if we had been to have judged, we &s;hould have thought that we nor the world could never le&s;s have &s;pared him than at the pre&s;ent time. But I &s;ee the hand of Heaven, the appointment of his wi&s;e Providence, in every &s;tep of this aw|ful di&s;pen&s;ation. It is his hand that has put the bitter cup into ours. And what does he now expect from us but a meek, humble, entire &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to his will? We know this is our duty. Let us pray for tho&s;e aids of his Spirit, which can only enable us to attain it. A father of the fatherle&s;s is GOD in his holy habitation. As &s;uch may your eyes be di|rected to him! He will &s;upport you. He will comfort you. And that he may, is not only my daily, but hourly prayer.</P>
<P>We have never de&s;erved &s;o great a good as that we have lo&s;t. And let us remember, that the be&s;t re&s;pect we can pay to his memory is to en|deavour, as far as we can, to follow his example, to cultivate tho&s;e amia|ble qualities that rendered him &s;o ju&s;tly dear to us, and &s;o greatly e&s;teem|ed by the world. Particularly I would recommend this to my dear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. May I have the joy to &s;ee him acting the part worthy the relation to &s;o amiable and excellent a parent, who&s;e memory, I hope, will ever be valu|able and &s;acred to him and to us all! Under GOD, may he be a comfort to me, and a &s;upport to the family! Much depends on him. His le&s;s I think peculiarly great. But I know an all-&s;ufficient GOD can overrule it as the means of the greate&s;t good to him.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to tell you how tenderly my heart feels for you all! how much I long to be with you to comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t you. In|deed, you are the only inducements I now have left to wi&s;h for life, that I may do what little is in my power to form and guide your tender years. For this purpo&s;e I take all po&s;&s;ible care of my health. I eat, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">p, and conver&s;e at times with a tolerable degree of cheerfulne&s;s. You, my dears, as the be&s;t return you can make me, will do the &s;ame, that I may not have &s;orrow upon &s;orrow. The many kind friends you have around you&punc; I am &s;ure, will not be w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ting in giving you all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and com|fort that is in their power. My kinde&s;t &s;alutations attend them all.</P>
<P>I hope to leave this place in about fourteen or twenty days. But the &s;oone&s;t I can reach Northampton will not be in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks or two months time. May GOD be with you, and give us, tho' a mourn|ful, yet a comfortable meeting! For your &s;akes I tru&s;t my life will be &s;pared. And, I ble&s;s GOD, my mind is under no painful anxiety as to the difficulties and dangers of the voyage.</P>
<P>The winds and the waves are in his hands, to whom I re&s;ign my&s;elf, and all that is deare&s;t to me. I know I &s;hall have your prayers, and tho&s;e of my deare&s;t friends with you.</P>

In her voyage homeward, and
<PB N="265" REF="025154_0263_0FCE74722A8F5320">
upon her return to her family, &s;he was &s;trength|ened and &s;upported beyond what could have been expected. By the circum&s;tance of Dr. Dod|dridge's
<PB N="266" REF="025154_0264_0FCE7473CD3CE698">
dying abroad &s;he lo&s;t a con&s;iderable an|nuity, which he had provided for her in ca&s;e of widowhood, and to which &s;he would otherwi&s;e have been entitled. To this con&s;equence of his voyage, &s;hould he die abroad, the Doctor was totally a &s;tranger; and it was happy for him that he was never acquainted with it, &s;ince it mu&s;t have lien with weight upon his &s;pirits. The genero&s;ity of his friends was active to com|pen&s;ate for the lo&s;s which Mrs. Doddridge had &s;u&s;tained. A &s;ub&s;cription was opened for her, chiefly in London, and, in a great mea&s;ure, under the direction of Mr. Neal, who&s;e kind offices to Dr. Doddridge's family were eminent and invariable. In a &s;hort time a &s;um was rai&s;ed, which was more than equal to the forfeiture of the annuity. Be&s;ides this, Mrs. Doddridge re|ceived &s;everal other hand&s;ome pre&s;ents, which were &s;ent her as &s;ub&s;criptions to the Family Ex|po&s;itor, from per&s;ons of rank, both among the clergy and laity of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. The manner in which the&s;e benefactions were com|municated heightened their value. They were
<PB N="267" REF="025154_0265_0FCE747832E5DC88">
be&s;towed with &s;o much delicacy, and reflected &s;uch high honour on Dr. Doddridge's memory, that &s;he retained a deep impre&s;&s;ion of them to the late&s;t hour of her life. Another in&s;tance of regard that was paid her, was, that the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters in the neighbourhood of Northampton, and the pupils who had begun to preach, &s;up|plied the Doctor's congregation, during his ab|&s;ence, and for half a year after his decea&s;e, that the &s;alary might be continued to his family for that time.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 299, 300.</NOTE></P>
<P>Dr. Doddridge's funeral &s;ermon was preached by Mr. Orton, who was in every view the pro|pere&s;t per&s;on for that &s;ervice. On what day it was delivered does not appear from the copy now lying before me. The text was, 1 Cor. xv.54, and the words, "Death is &s;wallowed up in victory." In a &s;hort time the di&s;cour&s;e was publi&s;hed, and had an exten&s;ive circulation, un|der the title of "The Chri&s;tian's Triumph over Death." It has &s;ince been annexed to the three volumes of the Doctor's Sermons and religious Tracts. Mr. Orton did not enter largely into the character of his revered and beloved friend, having probably then formed the de&s;ign of wri|ting his life.</P>
<P>The mu&s;es were not &s;ilent on Dr. Doddridge's decea&s;e. A poem to his memory was publi&s;hed by a young gentleman, who, at the time of com|po&s;ing it, was a pupil at his academy. The au|thor was Mr. Henry More, who afterwards &s;et|tled in Devon&s;hire, of which county he is a na|tive, and who is now a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter at
<PB N="268" REF="025154_0266_0FCE747ABB215828">
Le&s;kard in Cornwall. By his friends he is known not only to be an ingenious poet, but a &s;ound &s;cholar, e&s;pecially in Biblical critici&s;m. The following lines will afford an agreeable &s;pe|cimen of the merit of the poem.</P>
<Q><L>Her bays each &s;cience &s;catters on thy bier;</L>
<L>Each &s;ocial virtue drops the friendly tear.</L>
<L>Beneath a mould'ring temple's awful &s;hade,</L>

<L>When the felt pul&s;e, that at her touch before</L>

<L>In foreign lands, abandon'd, and alone,</L>
<L>She heard a darling hu&s;band's parting groan:</L>
<L>No children there receiv'd his la&s;t command,</L>

<L>No &s;ad dome&s;tic bore the &s;able bier;</L>
<L>No mournful pupil pour'd the tender tear;</L>
<L>No &s;oothing friend to mini&s;ter relief,</L>

<P>Dr. Doddridge was not hand&s;ome in his per|&s;on. In &s;tature he was &s;omewhat above the mid|dle &s;ize, with a &s;toop in his &s;houlders, and he was very thin and &s;lender. But when he was engaged in conver&s;ation, or employed in the pul|pit, there was a remarkable &s;prightline&s;s and vi|vacity in his countenance and manner, which commanded a general attention.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 301.</NOTE> Mrs. Dod|dridge &s;urvived her hu&s;band nearly forty years, all which time &s;he exhibited an eminent pattern of the Chri&s;tian virtues. She departed this life at Tewke&s;bury, in Gloce&s;ter&s;hire, where &s;he had long re&s;ided. The Doctor left four children, one &s;on, and three daughters. Philip, the &s;on, was brought up to the law, and &s;ettled as an at|torney at Tewke&s;bury, where he died &s;everal years ago. The elde&s;t daughter married Mr. Humphreys, an attorney of the &s;ame place. She and her two &s;i&s;ters, who are &s;ingle, are &s;till liv|ing.</P>
<P>It was a happy circum&s;tance, that, at the time of Dr. Doddridge's illne&s;s and decea&s;e, he had for his a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the Academy Mr. Samuel Clark, the &s;on of his friend Dr. Clark. In this gentleman were united wi&s;dom, knowledge, and an uncommon equanimity and &s;teadine&s;s of tem|per. Indeed, though very young, he was well qualified to have been cho&s;en to &s;ucceed Dr.
<PB N="270" REF="025154_0268_0FCE747D829A1B70">
Doddridge in the office of principal tutor: but this his mode&s;ty would not have permitted; and, upon the whole, it was undoubtedly proper that a man of more advanced life &s;hould be appoint|ed. The per&s;on elected by Mr. Coward's tru&s;|tees, and who had been recommended by Dr. Doddridge in his will, was the Rev. Mr. (after|wards Dr.) Caleb A&s;hworth, of Daventry, to which place the academy was removed in the autumn of 1752. Dr. A&s;hworth di&s;charged the duties of the tru&s;t with great fidelity and dili|gence, and with an ability that increa&s;ed as he proceeded in his employment. Mr. Clark con|tinued as his a&s;&s;i&s;tant for &s;everal years, and, in &s;o doing, contributed, in no &s;mall degree, to the u&s;efulne&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s of the in&s;titution. Whil&s;t he was at Daventry he preached and publi&s;hed a &s;ermon on occa&s;ion of the earthquake at Li&s;bon. He afterwards &s;ettled at the Old Meeting at Bir|mingham, where he was highly and ju&s;tly re|&s;pected and e&s;teemed, not only by his own con|gregation, but by all who knew him. On Sun|day the third of December, 1769, he was un|happily killed, in the prime of his days, by a fall from his hor&s;e, as he was &s;etting out to preach in the neighbourhood. The funeral di&s;|cour&s;e for him was delivered and printed by his friend Dr. A&s;hworth, under the title of
<Q>The Regards a Chri&s;tian Congregation owe to their decea&s;ed Mini&s;ters, repre&s;ented and urged.</Q></P>
<P>Of the writings of Dr. Doddridge, which were publi&s;hed in his life-time, we have already taken notice. With regard to his grand work, the Family Expo&s;itor, three volumes were &s;till
<PB N="271" REF="025154_0269_0FCE7481F6955BB0">
to make their appearance. Happily he had fin|i&s;hed the whole of the copy, in &s;hort hand, a few &s;light notes towards the conclu&s;ion ex|cepted, and the larger part had been tran|&s;cribed for the pre&s;s. This was the ca&s;e with all the fourth volume, the preface to which had been written by our author. In 1754 that volume was publi&s;hed, containing St. Paul's Epi&s;tle to the Romans, and his fir&s;t and &s;econd Epi&s;tles to the Corinthians.
<Q>As far as I know my&s;elf,</Q>
&s;ays the Doctor,
<Q>I have no favourite hypothe&s;is to &s;erve, nor a fondne&s;s for any un&s;criptural phra&s;es; in which &s;o many have, on one &s;ide, and the other, made the very being of orthodoxy to con&s;i&s;t. I have been di&s;po&s;ed to let &s;cripture carry me along with it, wherever it naturally leads, ra|ther than re&s;olve it &s;hould follow me. In|&s;tead of labouring to e&s;tabli&s;h any human &s;y&s;|tem, which has always, I fear, a leaven of imperfection attending it; I have endea|voured to keep controver&s;y as much out of &s;ight as po&s;&s;ible, and to repre&s;ent what I veri|ly believe to be the Scripture doctrine, in as &s;imple a manner as I could, and dive&s;ted of tho&s;e particular expre&s;&s;ions, which &s;ome, who perhaps are not aver&s;e to the main doctrine it|&s;elf, are ready to ri&s;e up again&s;t.</Q>
One rule of interpretation laid down by Dr. Doddridge was, when the text and context will bear two meanings, to prefer that which gives the noble&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, and might make the pa&s;&s;age in que&s;tion mo&s;t univer&s;ally u&s;eful. Plau|&s;ible, however, as this rule may appear, there is
<PB N="272" REF="025154_0270_0FCE748697C78640">
danger, unle&s;s it be exerci&s;ed with peculiar judg|ment, of its being occa&s;ionally productive of er|ror. In fact, the bu&s;ine&s;s of a commentator on &s;cripture is to find out the &s;ingle original &s;igni|fication of the language u&s;ed by the &s;acred wri|ters, and not to indulge his imagination in giv|ing a &s;cope to words beyond what was at fir&s;t &s;pecifically intended.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1755, Mr. Or|ton publi&s;hed a Collection of Dr. Doddridge's hymns. Few of the Doctor's works have been more generally acceptable, the &s;ixth edition of them having appeared in 1788. Indeed, they are, upon the whole, well calculated to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of chri&s;tian devotion; and, being all of them founded upon particular texts of &s;cripture, cannot fail of being u&s;eful to mini&s;ters who preach on the &s;ame texts. With re&s;pect to poetical merit, if they cannot be placed in a high rank, they have enough of it for the immediate view which they were intended to an&s;wer. As the author had not &s;o good an ear as Dr. Watts, his numbers are not equally flowing and harmo|nious. It may be mentioned to his prai&s;e, that he has not indulged to the extravagancies which Dr. Watts has fallen into, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t book of his hymns. I ob&s;erve with plea&s;ure, that Dr. Doddridge has not taken a &s;ingle &s;ub|ject from the Canticles.</P>
<P>The two remaining volumes of the Family Expo&s;itor, being the fifth and &s;ixth, were pub|li&s;hed by Mr. Orton in 1756. From the edi|tor's adverti&s;ement it appears, that Dr. Dod|dridge had him&s;elf tran&s;cribed for the pre&s;s the
<PB N="273" REF="025154_0271_0FCE7487F4138B00">
paraphra&s;e, improvements, and notes, of the fourth and fifth volumes, and the paraphra&s;e and improvements of the Epi&s;tle to the He|brews, and the two fir&s;t Epi&s;tles of St. John. The notes on the&s;e three Epi&s;tles, together with the paraphra&s;e, improvements, and notes, on the remaining Epi&s;tles and the "Revelation," were carefully tran&s;cribed either by Mr. Orton him|&s;elf, or by &s;ome of the Doctor's pupils, and the tran&s;cript was compared &s;everal times with the &s;hort-hand copy. An accident which, during the author's life, happened to part of the original manu&s;cript, de&s;erves to be recorded. In June, 1750, a fire broke out in his &s;tudy, occa&s;ioned by a wax candle's being left on his writing de&s;k, and con&s;umed many of his papers, and, in parti|cular, part of one volume of the &s;hort-hand copy of the Family Expo&s;itor. The light of the fire being, however, providentially di&s;covered by an oppo&s;ite neighbour, who gave an immediate a|larm, it was &s;peedily extingui&s;hed. When the Doctor was informed of the accident, he &s;eemed mo&s;t anxious about the pre&s;ervation of this ma|nu&s;cript; and when the flames were quenched, it appeared, to his great joy and &s;urpri&s;e, that only that part of the volume which had been tran&s;cribed was de&s;troyed; that the tran&s;cript lay in another place out of danger; and that all the untran&s;cribed pages were perfectly legible, the edges of them only being &s;inged.
<Q>Being an eye-witne&s;s,</Q>
&s;ays Mr. Orton,
<Q>of the danger and deliverance, I record this account of it,&mdash;chiefly as it &s;eems to denote a particu|lar ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of Providence in pre&s;erving this work,
<PB N="274" REF="025154_0272_0FCE748A48878090">
and a favourable omen that GOD intends it for exten&s;ive and la&s;ting u&s;efulne&s;s.</Q>
Tho&s;e who may not carry their reflections &s;o far as Mr. Orton has done, will &s;ympathize with Dr. Dod|dridge in the plea&s;ure which he received in hav|ing his manu&s;cript pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>Of all our author's writings, the Family Ex|po&s;itor is the mo&s;t important and valuable. It is the work in which he took the greate&s;t pains, and on which his literary reputation principally depends. Many of his notes di&s;play a &s;agacious and judicious &s;pirit of critici&s;m, and the practi|cal reflections are of general utility. How well the work has been received by the learned and pious world, is apparent from the continued de|mand for it down to the pre&s;ent time; nor is its popularity likely to decrea&s;e. It is the &s;eventh edition which is now called for by the public; not to mention the &s;eparate impre&s;&s;ions of it that have appeared in Scotland and Ireland. In pa&s;&s;|ing a ju&s;t encomium on the Family Expo&s;itor, it will not be under&s;tood that there is any de&s;ign of a&s;&s;erting that it is a performance which is to|tally exempt from imperfections and errors. Such is not the character of the be&s;t human productions. Diver&s;ities of &s;entiment will oc|cur with regard to Dr. Doddridge's interpreta|tions of particular pa&s;&s;ages, and his critici&s;ms upon them. Perhaps likewi&s;e, in &s;ome in&s;tan|ces, his paraphra&s;es may be deemed rather too redundant. But no ob&s;ervations of this kind are incon&s;i&s;tent with allowing to the work the prai&s;e of its contributing, in a high degree, to chri&s;tian in&s;truction and improvement. The
<PB N="275" REF="025154_0273_0FCE748FACB5C918">
proper inference to be drawn from any mi&s;takes into which the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful illucidations of the &s;criptures have fallen, is, not to depreciate their general merit, but to avoid placing an un|due confidence on their authority. While we thankfully derive from them the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they are capable of affording us in our enquiries into the meaning of the &s;acred oracles, we &s;hould freely examine, and impartially judge for our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Dr. Doddridge thought it would contribute to the u&s;efulne&s;s of his expo&s;ition, to dige&s;t the hi&s;tory of the four Evangeli&s;ts into one continu|ed &s;eries, or, in other words, to throw it into the order of an harmony. If &s;uch an harmony could be effectually and deci&s;ively a&s;certained, each &s;tory and di&s;cour&s;e would be exhibited with all its concurrent circum&s;tances, as recorded by the &s;acred penmen; frequent repetitions would be prevented; and a multitude of &s;eeming oppo|&s;itions be &s;o evidently reconciled as to &s;uper&s;ede many objections. The&s;e undoubtedly are de|&s;irable objects, and the attainment of them is worthy of being &s;ought for. We are indebted to the exertions of tho&s;e gentlemen who have laboured in this field of theological literature. Where they have not &s;ufficiently &s;ucceeded in the main point, they have, by their re&s;earches, been enabled to throw a new and beautiful light on many pa&s;&s;ages of the evangelical hi&s;torians. That there is no &s;mall difficulty in the general &s;ubject, is manife&s;t from the various &s;y&s;tems that have been formed upon it by the able&s;t &s;cholars, and the mo&s;t judicious critics.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="025154_0274_0FCE7491D6140DC8">One part of Dr. Doddridge's Family Expo&s;i|tor, which mu&s;t have co&s;t him uncommon pains, was his having every where interwoven the text with the paraphra&s;e, and carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed the former from the latter by the italic charac|ter. By this method it is impo&s;&s;ible to read the paraphra&s;e without the text; and every one may immediately &s;ee, not only the particular clau&s;e to which any explication an&s;wers, but al&s;o what are the words of the original, and what merely the &s;en&s;e of the commentator. Nor was our author content with barely in&s;erting the old tran&s;lation, but gave an entire new ver&s;ion of the whole Te&s;tament, the merit and u&s;efulne&s;s of which will in many re&s;pects be acknowledged. This tran&s;lation was extracted from the para|phra&s;e, and publi&s;hed in 1765, in two volumes, 12mo. with &s;ome alterations and improvements by the editor, together with an introduction, and a number of very &s;hort notes.</P>
<P>The la&s;t work of Dr. Doddridge which was given to the public, was his
<Q>Cour&s;e of Lec|tures on the principal Subjects of Pneumatol|ogy, Ethics, and Divinity; with References to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Authors on each Sub|ject.</Q>
Of the nature and value of the&s;e lec|tures, which appeared in 1763, in one volume, quarto, I have already &s;poken. As another edi|tion may probably &s;oon be demanded, it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ugge&s;t, that it would be extremely u&s;eful to enlarge the li&s;t of references, by intro|ducing the names and productions of tho&s;e wri|ters who have treated upon the &s;everal matters in que&s;tion &s;ince the Doctor's decea&s;e. To a per|&s;on

conver&s;ant in the hi&s;tory of controver&s;ies this would be no very difficult ta&s;k; and it might, in particular, ea&s;ily be executed by any gentle|man who, as a tutor, has made u&s;e of the lec|tures as a text-book, and who con&s;equently has been in the habit of referring to &s;ucceeding au|thors.</P>
<P>If Providence had continued Dr. Doddridge's life, he would undoubtedly have endeavoured to extend his u&s;efulne&s;s by many other publica|tions. He intended to print a &s;ermon to chil|dren, and &s;ome &s;acramental meditations. A con&s;iderable progre&s;s had been made by him in a "Di&s;&s;ertation on the Jewi&s;h Pro&s;elytes," the de&s;ign of which was to defend that opinion con|cerning them, which he mentions in &s;ome of his notes upon the Acts of the Apo&s;tles. An|other work, which he had nearly completed, and in which he di&s;played his critical knowledge of the Hebrew language, was a new Tran&s;lation of the minor Prophets. Neither the Di&s;&s;ertation on the Jewi&s;h Pro&s;elytes, nor the Tran&s;lation of the minor Prophets, were thought to be left in a &s;ufficient &s;tate of perfection to be given to the world.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 107, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with regard to the la&s;t of the&s;e objects is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">&s;s to be regret|ed, as the bu&s;ine&s;s hath &s;ince been executed with &s;o much judgment and learning by the excellent Bi&s;hop Newcome.</P>
<P>Upon Dr. Doddridge's works in general it would be ea&s;y to produce a variety of encomi|ums. The applau&s;es he received were nume|rous; and what added to their value was, that they came from men by whom it was an honour

to be applauded. Nor was it by the learned among the di&s;&s;enters only that his abilities and writings were held in high e&s;timation, but by many illu&s;trious ornaments of the church of Eng|land. This is abundantly apparent from the collection of letters lately publi&s;hed. There will be found, together with the prai&s;es of a Barker, a Miles, a Neal, a Leland, and a Lard|ner, tho&s;e of a Co&s;tard, a Warburton, an Oli|ver, a Newton, a Secker, an Ay&s;cough, a Grey, a Hunt, a Gilbert We&s;t, a Maddox, a Sherlock, a Hilde&s;ley, a Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et, and a Lord Lyttelton. "I have read," &s;ays Bi&s;hop Secker,
<Q>your woks with great &s;atisfaction, and, I hope, &s;ome benefit; and both rejoice and wonder that, in the mid&s;t of your other occupations, you continue able, as I pray GOD you long may, to oblige your fellow chri&s;tians &s;o often and &s;o highly from the pre&s;s. Indeed it mu&s;t and ought to be owned in general, that the di&s;|&s;enters have done excellently of late years in the &s;ervice of chri&s;tianity; and I hope our common welfare will make us chiefly atten|tive to our common intere&s;t, and unite us in a clo&s;er alliance.</Q>
By the way, the Bi&s;hop, in the &s;ame letter, has gently and properly re|buked Dr. Doddridge for the extravagantly com|plimental &s;train of his epi&s;tles.

<P>The reception which Dr. Doddridge's writ|ings met with abroad de&s;erves to be &s;pecifically noticed. It appears that the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them have been tran&s;lated into foreign lan|guages. His Sermons on Regeneration, Salva|tion by Grace, on the Power and Grace of Chri&s;t, and his Letter on Family Prayer, have been pub|li&s;hed in the Dutch tongue. The Memoirs of Colonel Gardiner have appeared in the Dutch, French, and German languages; and the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Religion in the &s;ame languages, to which may be added the Dani&s;h. It is ob&s;erv|able, that the tran&s;lation of the la&s;t work into French was undertaken by the particular en|couragement of the late Prince and Prince&s;s of Orange, and a number of the gentry in Holland. A Prote&s;tant Prince of the empire promi&s;ed to recommend it to tho&s;e about him; and it was &s;ub&s;cribed for by many per&s;ons of quality and rich citizens in Germany and Switzerland. Some learned men undertook to tran&s;late the former volumes of the Family Expo&s;itor into German; but the publication of it was oppo&s;ed by &s;everal of the Lutheran clergy, from an apprehen&s;ion that Dr. Doddridge's interpretation of particular pa&s;&s;ages, and his reflections upon them, might not agree with their e&s;tabli&s;hed principles, or
<PB N="280" REF="025154_0278_0FCE749B732746A0">
form of church government. To remove their terrors, the per&s;ons concerned in the tran&s;lation fir&s;t publi&s;hed the Sermons on Regeneration in that language; the candour and moderation of which had &s;uch an effect in quieting the oppo&s;i|tion, that the other work was completed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 123&mdash; 124.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such was the e&s;timation in which Dr. Dod|dridge's writings have been held, and continue to be held, both at home and abroad. It does not, however, hence follow, that his mo&s;t &s;in|cere admirers will think them&s;elves obliged to concur with him in every &s;entiment and every expre&s;&s;ion. Many judicious per&s;ons have wi&s;h|ed that his devotional treati&s;es had been more accommodated to univer&s;al u&s;e, by a le&s;s Calvin|i&s;tical turn of opinion and language.
<Q>I reck|on it one unhappine&s;s,</Q>
&s;ays Mr. Jones of Welwyn,
<Q>of this excellent man (my much re&s;pected friend) that, having early imbibed the notions of &s;ome particular &s;y&s;tems, he could not di&s;lodge them out of his mind in his age of riper judgment. This hath been ob|&s;erved by others.</Q>
Mr. Jones adds, that the Doctor's parts were uncommon, his learning great, his moderation equally &s;o, and his life and conduct truly chri&s;tian.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gentleman's Magazine, vol. liii. p. 103.</NOTE> Upon the whole, whatever diver&s;ity of judgment may be formed on different points, the grand end which Dr. Doddridge had in view, and the generally u&s;eful tendency of his works, cannot be denied. In every thing which he wrote, his aim was to pro|mote the great purpo&s;es of practical religion.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="025154_0279_0FCE749D32456668">The narrative which has now been given of Dr. Doddridge's life, has di&s;played the princi|pal circum&s;tances that illu&s;trate his temper and conduct. Neverthele&s;s, I cannot di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject without entering into a general view of his character. This I am induced to do, partly as it will afford me an opportunity of mention|ing &s;ome things not hitherto noticed, and partly becau&s;e I have the felicity, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, of writing from an intimate per&s;onal knowledge; which is a &s;atisfaction that has not frequently occurred in the numerous lives I have had oc|ca&s;ion to lay before the public. The view which I &s;hall take of our author will be of his intellectual, and of his religious and moral qual|ities.</P>
<P>I do not know that genius can be a&s;cribed to Dr. Doddridge, taking that word in its highe&s;t &s;ignification, as employing either a great inven|tive faculty in &s;cience, or that boldne&s;s of ima|gination which is productive of original imagery and combinations. In a lower and more popu|lar &s;en&s;e of the term, he might be &s;aid to have been a man of genius; for he had a quick con|ception and a lively fancy. He had a compre|hen&s;ion of mind that enabled him to proceed with celerity and vigour in the acqui&s;ition of knowledge; and that activity of his mental frame, which put it into his power to learn much in a little time, was happily accompanied with an invincible re&s;olution and per&s;everance in the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ecution of his &s;tudies. In con&s;e|quence of his uncommon application, he might even with moderate abilities have laid up a large
<PB N="282" REF="025154_0280_0FCE38343B023768">
&s;tock of various learning; and therefore it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that this &s;hould be the ca&s;e with him, when it is con&s;idered that he was endued with a quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, and a remarkable &s;trength of memory. So exten&s;ive was his ac|quaintance with books, that there were few on the general &s;ubjects of literature which he had not peru&s;ed with attention; and he could retain and ea&s;ily recollect what in them was mo&s;t wor|thy to be remembered. Of ancient knowledge he had a con&s;iderable &s;tore. With regard to the learned languages, if he could not be called a profound lingui&s;t, he was &s;ufficiently ver&s;ed in them to read the mo&s;t valuable pieces of antiqui|ty with ta&s;te and plea&s;ure. This is apparent from his paraphra&s;e and notes on the New Te&s;ta|ment, in which he has frequently illu&s;trated the force and beauty of the originals with great judg|ment, and in the true &s;pirit of critici&s;m.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 105&mdash;10<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>
<P>Dr. Doddridge was well acquainted with the Greek philo&s;ophers and orators, among the la&s;t of whom he was particularly devoted to De|mo&s;thenes. To the poets of Greece he was far from being a &s;tranger; but he was not, I think, deeply conver&s;ant with its tragedians. I remem|ber, while I re&s;ided with him, his having read Pindar with much admiration. With the Latin cla&s;&s;ics he was largely acquainted. As became a divine and a theological tutor, he diligently &s;tudied the ancient fathers, e&s;pecially of the three fir&s;t centuries. He paid particular regard to the apologi&s;ts for chri&s;tianity, and was a great ma&s;ter of Origen and Eu&s;ebius. Beyond the fourth
<PB N="283" REF="025154_0281_0FCE749FE7A3B868">
century his knowledge of this &s;pecies of litera|ture did not, I believe, widely extend, though it did not wholly &s;top there. With eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory he had a large acquaintance, and civil hi&s;tory engaged no &s;mall degree of his attention. To this he applied not only to enrich his memo|ry with facts, but to make &s;uch reflections upon them, as tended either to promote his in&s;ight into human nature, to exemplify the interpo&s;i|tions of Providence, or to explain and illu&s;trate the &s;acred writings.</P>
<P>Though Dr. Doddridge's di&s;po&s;ition rather led him to cultivate the more polite than the ab|&s;tru&s;er parts of &s;cience, he was far from being a &s;tranger to mathematical and philo&s;ophical &s;tu|dies. The &s;y&s;tem of Algebra which he read to his pupils was of his own compo&s;ition. But the favourite object of his application, and that in which his principal excellency lay, was divinity, taking that word in its large&s;t &s;en&s;e. Whatever could tend to &s;trengthen the proofs of natural or revealed religion, to a&s;&s;i&s;t our conceptions of the divine Nature, or enable us more perfectly to un|der&s;tand the doctrines and di&s;coveries of &s;cripture, he thought de&s;erving of the mo&s;t attentive re|gard. To the evidences of the Jewi&s;h and chri&s;|tian revelation he had paid uncommon attention, and how complete a ma&s;ter he was of the &s;ubject is apparent from his lectures. Perhaps there were few men who had more carefully &s;tudied the different &s;y&s;tems of theology, or who could point out their &s;everal defects with greater accu|racy and judgment. While he was not one of tho&s;e who affect to treat with contempt the la|bours
<PB N="284" REF="025154_0282_0FCE74A3A4936F10">
of the wi&s;e and the learned who have gone before them, but was always ready to receive whatever light they could afford him, neverthe|le&s;s, without a &s;lavi&s;h regard to human &s;chemes, he took the &s;acred oracles for his guide, and al|ways referred to them for the proofs of the doc|trinal &s;entiments which he maintained. Upon the whole, I entirely agree with Mr. Orton, that, though others might exceed him in their acquaintance with antiquity, or their &s;kill in the languages, he was &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by few in the extent of his learning, and in the variety of u&s;eful and important knowledge of which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p 107&mdash;110.</NOTE></P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;tores of information, it was a great advantage to Dr. Doddridge that he had an uncommon facility of &s;peaking and of writ|ing. He u&s;ed to de&s;cant, in his lectures, on the &s;ubjects treated of, with &s;urpri&s;ing per&s;pi|cuity and freedom; and the &s;ame per&s;picuity and freedom attended him when he took the pen in hand. This was owing to the orderly di&s;po&s;ition in which things lay in his mind. As his own ideas on the points he had &s;tudied, were clear and di&s;tinct, &s;o his method of ar|ranging his thoughts was uncommonly ju&s;t and natural. There are, perhaps, few di&s;cour&s;es in our language which excel tho&s;e which were u&s;ually delivered by our author, either in the ac|curacy of the divi&s;ions, or the adaptation of the &s;entiments to the &s;ubject di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. According to the fa&s;hion that now prevails, he may po&s;&s;ibly be thought to have &s;ometimes laid down and recapitulated his &s;cheme in too formal a manner.
<PB N="285" REF="025154_0283_0FCE74A480FBADB0">
But if he rather exceeded in this re&s;pect, his er|ror had the advantage of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the memory, and contributing to the in&s;truction of his hearers and readers.</P>
<P>Though Dr. Doddridge's invincible per&s;ever|ance in &s;tudy has already been mentioned, I am de&s;irous of enlarging a little farther upon it. Literary diligence is a matter which I have al|ways earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to pre&s;s on every young man of liberal education with whom I have had acquaintance. When accompanied with original genius, it is the parent of all that is great and valuable in &s;cience; and where there is not much of original genius, provided there be a tolerable capacity, it is endued with the power of pro|ducing valuable attainments, and of rendering eminent &s;ervices to the learned world. Of this diligence Dr. Doddridge was a &s;triking example. The &s;malle&s;t portions of time were precious to him; and he was eager to &s;eize every moment, even while he was waiting for dinner, company, or his pupils a&s;&s;embling together, that he might make &s;ome advance in any work in which he was engaged. So &s;olicitous was he for continu|al improvement, that one of his &s;tudents gene|rally read to him when he was &s;having and dre&s;|&s;ing. This was a benefit to the pupils, as he took occa&s;ion to in&s;truct them, by remarking on their manner of reading, and pointing out the excellencies and defects, either in &s;entiment or language, of the book before them. When he was upon a journey, or on occa&s;ional vi&s;its to his friends, where he &s;pent the night, he took his papers with him, and employed at lea&s;t part of
<PB N="286" REF="025154_0284_0FCE74A6A90FEAC8">
the morning in carrying on &s;ome one or other of his important de&s;igns. From the time that he began to write his Family Expo&s;itor, &s;omething was done every day in it towards preparing it for the pre&s;s. To all this it may be added, that his employments as an author and a tutor, never ob|&s;tructed his mo&s;t abundant labours as a mini&s;ter and a pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>But what places Dr. Doddridge's diligence in a &s;till more con&s;picuous point of view, is the ex|tent of his corre&s;pondence. This alone would have been almo&s;t &s;ufficient to have employed the whole time of an ordinary per&s;on. Be&s;ides his corre&s;pondence with the parents and guardians of his pupils, he had a number of letters to write, in an&s;wer to que&s;tions of moment which were propo&s;ed to him by his brethren, and e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who had &s;tudied under him. The&s;e la&s;t naturally applied to him for advice and direction, under the various difficulties which occurred to them in their re&s;pective &s;ituations. Many were the congregations that had recour&s;e to him for mini&s;ters, or upon other accounts. His judg|ment, likewi&s;e, was frequently de&s;ired by learned men, concerning critical que&s;tions, or works which they were preparing for the pre&s;s; and his own publications gave occa&s;ion for enquiries of this nature. Several foreign gentlemen and divines, who had heard of his character, and pe|ru&s;ed his writings, &s;ought his epi&s;tolary acquaint|ance; and to corre&s;pond with them in Latin or French, was an object that demanded particular attention. It is, indeed, &s;urpri&s;ing to find how many hundred letters were received and an&s;wer-</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="025154_0285_0FCE74A85F59B220">A very honourable part of Dr. Doddridge's corre&s;pondence was that which he maintained with &s;ome of the brighte&s;t ornaments, both among the clergy and laity of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. This is apparent from the Collection of Letters lately publi&s;hed. We there &s;ee how much he was e&s;teemed, and how highly he was thought of, by the fir&s;t religious and literary characters of the age. In the collection referred to, the letters of Warburton make a di&s;tingui&s;h|ed figure, and &s;hew that great man in a new and very amiable light. They di&s;play not only his learning, but the piety, benevolence, and good|ne&s;s of his mind. The &s;everity, or rather the arrogance, with which he treated his literary an|tagoni&s;ts mu&s;t undoubtedly have afforded too ju&s;t cau&s;e for leaving an unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion of him in the e&s;timation of the world. But in private life he appears in a far more agreeable point of view. The only time I had ever the honour of being in his company, which was an hour and a half in his own &s;tudy, I found him remarkably conde&s;cending in his manner, and admirably in&s;tructive and entertaining in his con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Dr. Doddridge's corre&s;pondence was, I think, in &s;ome in&s;tances carried to an extent that might have been &s;pared; and it is now certain that his friend Mr. Neal was &s;o far of the &s;ame opinion, as to give him a gentle rebuke upon the &s;ubject.* There were people, who&s;e good intentions were &s;uperior to their wi&s;dom, and who had very lit|tle valuable to communicate, that were proud of
<PB N="288" REF="025154_0286_0FCE74A9E6EFAE90">
writing letters to him, and of receiving his an|&s;wers; and &s;uch was the ea&s;ine&s;s of his di&s;po&s;i|tion, that he was more profu&s;e in his returns to their kind affections, than convenience or even a regard to his health would admit. Sometimes he lightened his burden, by making u&s;e of the pen of his pupils, to whom he dictated his letters, while he him&s;elf went on with his Family Ex|po&s;itor, or any other work in which he was em|ployed. I was not unfrequently either his aman|uen&s;is on the&s;e occa&s;ions, or read to him while he an&s;wered his corre&s;pondents.</P>
<P>I am next to take a &s;urvey of Dr. Doddridge in his religious and moral character. And here the prime and leading feature of his &s;oul was that of devotion. This was the pervading prin|ciple of his actions, whether private or public. What Dr. John&s;on has ob&s;erved with regard to Dr. Watts, that as piety predominated in his mind, it was diffu&s;ed over his works; and that whatever he took in hand was, by his ince&s;&s;ant &s;olicitude for &s;ouls, converted to theology,* may with equal propriety be applied to Dr. Doddridge. The greate&s;t pains were taken by him to keep up an habitual &s;en&s;e of the Supreme Being; to maintain and increa&s;e the ardour of religion in his heart; and to furni&s;h him&s;elf, by devout ex|erci&s;es, for the important labours of his &s;tation. Nor was it to his &s;ecret retirements that his pie|ty was limited: it was manife&s;ted in every part of the day, and appeared in his u&s;ual intercour&s;e with men. In the little vacancies of time which occur to the bu&s;ie&s;t of mankind, he was fre|quently
<PB N="289" REF="025154_0287_0FCE74AE4F7A95E0">
lifting up his &s;oul to GOD. When he lectured on philo&s;ophy, hi&s;tory, anatomy, or other &s;ubjects not immediately theological, he would endeavour to graft &s;ome religious in&s;truc|tions upon them, that he might rai&s;e the minds of his pupils to devotion, as well as to know|ledge; and in his vi&s;its to his people the chri&s;|tian friend and mini&s;ter were united.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 260, 263.</NOTE></P>
<P>Dr. Doddridge entertained a high idea of the efficacy of prayer.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">41.</NOTE> It is a point upon which I would &s;peak with great humility and deference; but I cannot avoid thinking that, in this re&s;pect, he carried his &s;entiments &s;omewhat farther than rea&s;on and truth will warrant. Of the import|ance of prayer, as a natural and ju&s;t tribute to the Deity, as an admirable method of cheri&s;hing the virtues of the religious life, and as connect|ed with the divine approbation and favour, no one, I tru&s;t, can be more truly &s;en&s;ible than my|&s;elf. My views of the matter have lately been &s;o fully di&s;played, that they cannot be liable to any mi&s;con&s;truction.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></NOTE> But &s;till I am obliged to ob&s;erve, that Dr. Doddridge did not, in my ap|prehen&s;ion, &s;ufficiently limit his notions of the efficacy of prayer. He appeared to a&s;cribe to it &s;uch an immediate influence upon the Supreme mind, and to expect from it &s;uch interpo&s;itions, as are &s;carcely con&s;i&s;tent with the regular order of Providence, and the &s;tated cour&s;e of events in the world. If, however, he erred upon this head, he has erred with many wi&s;e and good
<PB N="290" REF="025154_0288_0FCE74B0A51C0FA0">
men who have gone before him, and by whom he has been &s;ucceeded. Perhaps Dr. Price and Dr. Ogden may be added to the number.</P>
<P>The piety of Dr. Doddridge was accompanied with the warme&s;t benevolence to his fellow crea|tures. No one could more &s;trongly feel that the love of GOD was to be united with love to man. Nor was this a principle that re&s;ted in kind wi&s;hes and pathetic feelings for the happi|ne&s;s of others, but was manife&s;ted in the mo&s;t active exertions for their welfare. No &s;cheme of doing good was ever propo&s;ed to him into which he did not enter with ardour. This was apparent from many circum&s;tances that might copiou&s;ly be enlarged upon, did it comport with my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. His Sermon for the bene|fit of the County Ho&s;pital at Northampton has been &s;poken of before; and it may here be add|ed, that he not only contributed generou&s;ly to that ho&s;pital, but &s;pent much time in ripening the de&s;ign. He often reflected, with great &s;a|tisfaction, on the pains he had taken to e&s;tabli&s;h this charity, and on the good effects which it had produced, both in relieving many objects of di&s;tre&s;s, and in promoting a &s;ocial and catholic &s;pirit among per&s;ons of different parties and per|&s;ua&s;ions. It was at his own expen&s;e that he printed and di&s;tributed his "Friendly Letter to the Private Soldiers of a Regiment of Foot." During the rebellion of 1745, he was remarka|bly zealous in the cau&s;e of his king and his country, and contributed to the rai&s;ing of a regi|ment under the command of the earl of Halifax, by his own liberality, as well as by his influence
<PB N="291" REF="025154_0289_0FCE74B1EB859230">
over others. In the ca&s;e of a poor Iri&s;hman, whom he thought to be unju&s;tly condemned for murder, he exerted him&s;elf in a very extraordina|ry manner, though without &s;ucce&s;s. But the genero&s;ity of his mind was the mo&s;t di&s;played when any &s;chemes for propagating religion, and for &s;preading the go&s;pel among tho&s;e who were &s;trangers to it, were propo&s;ed. In every thing of this kind he was always ready to take the lead, and was ardent in endeavouring to in&s;pire his friends with the &s;ame &s;pirit.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 178&mdash;181.</NOTE></P>
<P>No one could be more amiable than Dr. Dod|dridge was in his private virtues and manners. It would be needle&s;s to enlarge on the tenderne&s;s of his affections as a hu&s;band, a father, and a re|lation: nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t upon his con|duct to his pupils. If he occa&s;ionally di&s;tin|gui&s;hed any one of them by his particular fa|vour, this did not hinder his behaving to all of them with the kindne&s;s of a parent; and his regard to them was never abated, excepting from their own fault. In the character of a friend he &s;hone with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre. Of friend&s;hip he entertained a &s;ublime idea, and his heart was admirably fitted for di&s;charging all the offices, and reli&s;hing all the delights, of this endearing connection. It was the happy lot of his life to be honoured with many valuable and faithful friends; and how &s;en&s;ible he was of his felicity in this re&s;pect was di&s;played in every return of gratitude, e&s;teem, and affection,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 132.</NOTE> His deport|ment in company was &s;trikingly polite, affable, and agreeable; and in conver&s;ation he greatly ex|celled;

his di&s;cour&s;e being at once in&s;tructive and entertaining, and not unfrequently ri&s;ing to the &s;plendid.</P>
<P>The candour of Dr. Doddridge's mind rela|tive to his &s;entiments of other per&s;ons merit, was carried to the highe&s;t pitch, and indeed was &s;ometimes &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as to lead him to form a far better opinion of &s;everal of his ac|quaintance than in fact they de&s;erved. This fault was gently and plea&s;antly touched upon by Mr. Barker, in one of his letters.
<Q>But are you aware,</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q>what a creature you are? I love you beyond expre&s;&s;ion, and admire your abilities, furniture, &s;pirits, &amp;c. more than you imagine; and not a man in the world re|joices more in your u&s;efulne&s;s than I do; and yet I often make my&s;elf merry with your cha|racter and conduct. You are &s;o entirely de|voted to GOD, to truth, and holine&s;s, that it is very ea&s;y to impo&s;e upon you under the ap|pearance of any of the&s;e. And you are &s;o per|fectly made up of civility, candour, and good nature, that a pious enthu&s;ia&s;t, or a godly dunce, is welcome to your table, arms, and heart. You are &s;o good your&s;elf, that you think every body ten times better than they are; &s;ee merit in the darkne&s;s of midnight; cannot &s;ee faults without a noon-day &s;un; forgive injuries before they are confe&s;&s;ed; and confer favours as a reward for affronts.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters, ubi &s;upra, p. 139.</NOTE> With &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of mind, it is not &s;ur|pri&s;ing that Dr. Doddridge &s;hould frequently be unable to re&s;i&s;t the arts of deception: and

yet this did not proceed from a general ignorance of the world. He was well acquainted with men and with manners, and could often enter into, and di&s;criminate, with no &s;mall degree of pene|tration, the characters of mankind. But, at the &s;ame time, &s;o ardent were the feelings of his pi|ety, and &s;uch was the &s;uavity of his temper, that he could not ea&s;ily per&s;uade him&s;elf that any per&s;ons were in&s;incere, who made a profe&s;&s;ion of religion and goodne&s;s. There is a con&s;iderable difference between a &s;peculative and a practical knowledge of the world. A man may po&s;&s;e&s;s much of the former, and yet, from a certain flexibility and tenderne&s;s of mind, have little of the latter. In particular in&s;tances, he may have &s;agacity enough to &s;u&s;pect deceit, while he re|fu&s;es to indulge the &s;u&s;picion, le&s;t it &s;hould lead him to err in his judgment, and be a motive for ob&s;tructing the exertions of his benevolence. Such was the ca&s;e with Dr. Doddridge, and &s;uch, al&s;o, was the ca&s;e with George Lord Lyt|telton. They would both of them rather have cho&s;en to be mi&s;taken, than to have lo&s;t an op|portunity of contributing to the relief of real di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>In his &s;entiments of tho&s;e who differed from him in religious opinions, Dr. Doddridge exer|ci&s;ed great moderation. He never confined truth or goodne&s;s to one particular &s;ect; and he be|haved with the utmo&s;t candour to the members of the church of England. Of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of his country he always &s;poke with re&s;pect; and he never made any petulant objec|tions to its wor&s;hip or di&s;cipline, or uttered

again&s;t it any &s;evere or unkind reflections. His corre&s;pondence with various clergymen of the highe&s;t rank and merit has heretofore been no|ticed. It was deeply lamented by him, that a &s;eparation from the e&s;tabli&s;hment was, in his apprehen&s;ion, and that of many other good men, rendered &s;o nece&s;&s;ary; and he &s;incerely wi&s;hed and prayed for a greater union among Prote&s;tants. A like candid and friendly &s;pirit he endeavoured to promote among his pupils; and he did it with &s;ucce&s;s; for few of them, I believe, can be mentioned, who have not, in this re&s;pect, fol|lowed the in&s;tructions and imitated the ex|ample of their tutor.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton&punc; ubi &s;upra, p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">8 &mdash;169, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1, 164.</NOTE> With all Dr. Dod|dridge's moderation of temper, he did not in every ca&s;e meet with a &s;uitable return. Some time after he had &s;et up his academy at North|ampton, a pro&s;ecution was commenced again&s;t him in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, by the in&s;tigation of &s;everal dignitaries of the church. The &s;tep, however, was totally di&s;approved of by many other eminent members of the e&s;tabli&s;hment. Neverthele&s;s, the per&s;ons who had engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eemed determined to carry it on with vigour; and, as the laws then &s;tood, they mu&s;t have &s;ucceded in their de&s;ign, had not an application been made to King George the Se|cond, who received, from &s;ome gentlemen of rank and influence, &s;uch a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of the Doctor's loyal, peaceable, and moderate prin|ciples and character, as induced his Maje&s;ty to give an expre&s;s order for putting a &s;top to the pro&s;ecution.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="025154_0293_0FCE74BB52A19B88">That candour of mind which Dr. Doddridge exerci&s;ed towards the members of the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed church, was cultivated by him with regard to his di&s;&s;enting brethren, of different denomi|nations. He was &s;olicitous to be upon friendly terms, as far as po&s;&s;ible, with all of them; and by the generality of them he was held in high e&s;timation. If this was not the ca&s;e without exception, it will not appear &s;urpri&s;ing to tho&s;e who reflect upon the diver&s;ities of &s;entiment that are found among the di&s;&s;enters. There were a few among them who even went &s;o far as to charge him with in&s;incerity. The ac|cu&s;ation they brought again&s;t him was, that he u&s;ed &s;ome particular phra&s;es, in his writings, in a &s;en&s;e different from that in which he him&s;elf under&s;tood them, in order to plea&s;e a party. A friend having acquainted him with this charge, he an&s;wered as follows:
<Q>My con&s;cience doth not tell me that I am at all to blame on the head you mention. I write for the public (as I would al&s;o do in every private corre&s;pond|ence) as in the pre&s;ence of GOD, and in the views of his judgment. I would not pur|cha&s;e that phantom, popularity, which is oft|en owing to the very wor&s;t part of a man's character or performances, by any complian|ces beneath the dignity of a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter; an office, of which I think &s;o highly, as to be deeply &s;en&s;ible how unworthy I am to bear it. On the other hand, I do indeed de&s;ire to give as little offence as I hone&s;tly can; and I have high authorities for it: and though I am, and always declare that I am, in my judgment, great|ly

again&s;t the impo&s;ition of human phra&s;es, yet, as &s;ome can hardly be avoided on the one hand or the other, I choo&s;e to adopt and u&s;e &s;ome that are ambiguous, in what I take to be a fair &s;en&s;e, though not the only &s;en&s;e they might bear; and by declaring it, to endeavour to fix a good idea to them, rather than ab&s;olutely to declare again&s;t, or even totally to di&s;u&s;e them. Oth|ers, wider by far in their &s;entiments than I, are indulged in this, and even applauded for it: I have the misfortune (I cannot u&s;e the word more properly) to be condemned.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 221.</NOTE> Whil&s;t I have a full conviction of Dr. Doddridge's &s;in|cerity in this matter, I cannot agree with him in opinion. Offen&s;ive expre&s;&s;ions may ju&s;tly be avoided; but &s;urely, ambiguous ones &s;hould ne|ver de&s;ignedly be adopted. The language we u&s;e, in delivering our views of things, ought to be natural, clear, and capable only of one &s;ignifi|cation.</P>
<P>The charge I have mentioned again&s;t Dr. Doddridge with regard to his writings, has been extended to his preaching. By &s;ome of his enemies it was a&s;&s;erted, that he was a trim|mer in the pulpit. The fact, I am &s;atisfied, was preci&s;ely as follows. When he preached in different places, he &s;o far accommodated him&s;elf to the di&s;po&s;itions of the people before whom he di&s;cour&s;ed, as to avoid giving of|fence. If a congregation con&s;i&s;ted of per&s;ons who were of free &s;entiments in religion, his &s;ermon was entirely of a practical nature. On the other hand, in preaching before a Calvin|i&s;tical
<PB N="297" REF="025154_0295_0FCE74C49FFB4180">
&s;ociety, it was cu&s;tomary with him to choo&s;e what was called an evangelical &s;ubject. In neither ca&s;e did he deliver any thing that was contrary to his &s;incere opinion. His accu&s;ers did not &s;ufficiently recollect that he was far more devoted to what were deemed the orthodox doc|trines than they were ready to imagine; and he had an undoubted right to be believed, when he declared, as he has done in the letter before cited.
<Q>On the whole, I know a&s;&s;uredly, that I have not on any occa&s;ion belied the real &s;entiments of my heart.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 222.</NOTE> The per&s;ons who were mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to find fault with Dr. Doddridge, with re&s;pect to the point in que&s;tion, were tho&s;e who are entitled the rational di&s;&s;enters. They could not ea&s;ily per&s;uade them&s;elves that a man of &s;uch abilities, and general liberality of mind, could entertain very different opinions from their own; and they wi&s;hed to have him rank more expli|citly among them. It cannot be denied, that in one or two in&s;tances they had &s;ome rea&s;on to complain of his timidity: but, at the &s;ame time, there were many occa&s;ions on which he behav|ed with a very becoming fortitude. Once, I remember, &s;ome narrow-minded people of his congregation gave him no &s;mall trouble on ac|count of a gentleman, in communion with the church, who was a profe&s;&s;ed Arian, and who otherwi&s;e departed from the common &s;tandard of orthodoxy. This gentleman they wi&s;hed either to be excluded from the ordinance of the Lord's Supper, or to have his attendance upon it prevented. But the Doctor declared, that he
<PB N="298" REF="025154_0296_0FCE74C5B8EBB378">
would &s;acrifice his place, and even his life, ra|ther than fix any &s;uch mark of di&s;couragement upon one, who, whatever his doctrinal &s;enti|ments were, appeared to be a real chri&s;tian. When our author happened to be in company with per&s;ons of rank and fortune, he never &s;uf|fered the lea&s;t tendency to profanene&s;s or licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s to pa&s;s unnoticed; but manife&s;ted his di&s;like to them, with the freedom of the divine, accompanied with the politene&s;s of the gentle|man. A corre&s;pondent having charged him with un&s;oundne&s;s in one of his publications, his only an&s;wer was, <HI>Quod &s;crip&s;i, &s;crip&s;i</HI>;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letters to a young Clergyman, p. 103.</NOTE>
<Q>What I have written, I have written.</Q></P>
<P>How &s;incerely Dr. Doddridge dete&s;ted the want of integrity in character, was di&s;played in the following fact. One of his pupils was in the habit of making a je&s;t of what is called or|thodoxy, and of ridiculing tho&s;e who adhered to it; and this he continued to do, up to the time in which he began to preach. Then, to the no &s;mall &s;urpri&s;e of his intimate acquaintance, it was rumoured, that in the congregations where he had officiated in the neighbourhood of North|ampton, he had appeared highly Calvini&s;tical, and indeed much more &s;o than almo&s;t any other of his fellow-&s;tudents. For obvious rea&s;ons he declined ever preaching at Northampton. At length, the affair was brought before the Doctor; and both parts of the charge having been proved by deci&s;ive evidence, the young man was di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed. Being a per&s;on of &s;ome fortune, he was not involved by his di&s;grace in any pecuniary diffi|culties.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="025154_0297_0FCE74C700157818">With that impartiality which is the duty of every biographer, I have mentioned, in the cour&s;e of my narrative, the in&s;tances wherein it appear|ed to me that the character of Dr. Doddridge was &s;haded with &s;ome degree of imperfection. The &s;ame impartiality obliges me to add, that, at times, he had too oftentatious a manner of &s;peaking concerning the multiplicity of his em|ployments, engagements, and corre&s;pondences; and that he was fonder of applau&s;e, from every quarter, than was de&s;irable in one who was &s;o ju&s;tly entitled to it, where applau&s;e was an hon|our. I have often thought that in certain points he had a re&s;emblance of Cicero. He re&s;embled him in the love of fame, and in not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing what may be called the &s;ternne&s;s of fortitude. He re&s;embled him likewi&s;e in more e&s;timable qualities; in the copiou&s;ne&s;s, diffu&s;ion, and pa|thos of his eloquence; and in the &s;en&s;ibilities and tenderne&s;s of his mind, e&s;pecially as di&s;played in the lo&s;s of a daughter.</P>
<P>When all Dr. Doddridge's imperfections are collected together, they will be found to have been very trifling in compari&s;on with his excel|lencies. One or two more of his virtues I &s;hall touch upon before I conclude. Few have ex|ceeded him in the exerci&s;e of humility, both with relation to GOD and man. With re&s;pect to GOD, it was apparent in the deepe&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of concern for the defects of his improvements and his &s;ervices; and with regard to man, it was manife&s;ted in his conde&s;cen&s;ion to the meane&s;t per&s;ons, in his behaviour to his pupils, and in the patience with which he &s;ubmitted to the words
<PB N="300" REF="025154_0298_0FCE7556CE8C3A58">
of reproof. He was even highly thankful to his friends for pointing out to him what they judg|ed to be ami&s;s in his conduct. The language of humility that was u&s;ed by him, though undoubt|edly &s;incere, was &s;ometimes carried to an exce&s;s. In a letter to Dr. Wood of Norwich, he thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf:
<Q>Pity me, and pray for me, as you do, in the mid&s;t of &s;o many hurries. Oh, my poor, poor attempts of &s;ervice! They &s;hame me continually. My prayers, my &s;er|mons, my lectures, my books (in hand) my letters, all daily &s;hame me.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters to and from Dr. Doddridge, p. 307.</NOTE> Nothing can vindicate &s;uch humiliating terms from the charge of affectation but the remembrance that the let|ter was written under a peculiar depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, united with that &s;trong &s;en&s;e which Dr. Doddridge always entertained of the ardour, zeal, and diligence, with which the duties of life ought to be performed.</P>
<P>Among the Doctor's other excellencies, I might in&s;i&s;t upon the re&s;ignation, &s;erenity, and cheerfulne&s;s, with which he &s;ubmitted to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the pre&s;ent &s;tate. One of his afflic|tions, and it was an affliction that called for the exerci&s;e of his meekne&s;s and patience, was the unkind treatment which he &s;ometimes met with from tho&s;e who owed to him a far different kind of behaviour. Few men le&s;s de&s;erved to be evil &s;poken of; but to pa&s;s through the world with|out reproach is not the lot of the pure&s;t virtue. Some of his pupils were angry with him, and &s;et them&s;elves to mi&s;repre&s;ent his character, be|cau&s;e he would not recommend them to places
<PB N="301" REF="025154_0299_0FCE3840FB6A1540">
they wi&s;hed for, but for which he con&s;cientiou&s;ly judged them to be unqualified. His kind be|haviour to them in other re&s;pects did not com|pen&s;ate, in their e&s;timation, for the wound he had given to their &s;elf-opinion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orton, ubi &s;upra, p. 229</NOTE> This is a difficulty which has been experienced by others, who, from their &s;ituations among the di&s;&s;en|ters, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have any influence in recommending to vacant congregations. Dr. Doddridge was even a&s;per&s;ed in the ca&s;e of a guardian&s;hip, where he had acted with the ut|mo&s;t probity, friend&s;hip, and benevolence.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 23<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> Whatever was the ill u&s;uage to which he was expo&s;ed, he &s;u&s;tained it with mildne&s;s, and was always ready to manife&s;t a forgiving temper. Nothing could be farther from his character than a re&s;entful di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, Dr. Doddridge was not on|ly a great man, but one of the mo&s;t excellent and u&s;eful chri&s;tians, and chri&s;tian mini&s;ters, that ever exi&s;ted. The impre&s;&s;ion of his nu|merous and amiable virtues will not be effaced from my mind &s;o long as it retains any &s;en&s;e of feeling or reflection. So far will be the impre&s;&s;ion from being lo&s;t upon me, that I &s;hall always cheri&s;h it with the utmo&s;t ardour; and I e&s;teem it as no &s;mall felicity of my life, that I have been pre&s;erved to give this te&s;timony of duty, grati|tude, and affection, to the memory of my bene|factor, my tutor, my friend, and my father.</P>
