<HEAD>The EUROPEAN TRAVELLER IN AMERICA. IN THREE LETTERS TO HIS FRIEND IN LONDON.</HEAD>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE national events that have taken place &s;ince I &s;aw you, lead me to imagine, that you have not wholly forgotten what were my political &s;enti|ments, at the time when I left England. I never was enthu&s;ia&s;tic enough to imagine my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a prophetic &s;pirit. However, with re&s;pect to the i&s;&s;ue of the American war, if my arrow was ca&s;t at random, you are yet my witne&s;s, that it has not hit wide of the mark. The idea of my country's ru|in had long impre&s;&s;ed my mind. And this, when I embarked for America, made the farewell peculiarly affectionate. In whatever company or employ I was engaged, the idea of American glory was in view,
<PB N="4" REF="018944_0004_0FA90BA33A15E368">
until it was painted on my mind, even to a charm. And the moment I &s;et my foot on the &s;hore, I em|braced it for my own. And as &s;uch, the public in|tere&s;t has ever &s;ince had my pa&s;&s;ions at perfect com|mand; my joy, has ebbed and flowed, with the com|plexion of the times. Had I been a native of Ame|rica, I could not have felt a &s;tronger attachment to her welfare. Sick of the manners of my country, and European fa&s;hions at large, I thought of nothing in America, but &s;implicity of life, indu&s;try, oeconomy, and the noble&s;t patrioti&s;m. This I frankly confe&s;s was the fruit of an overheated imagination: for ex|perience has &s;ince &s;upplied the defect of rea&s;on, and taught me the mi&s;take.</P>
<P>I at fir&s;t landed at Philadelphia, where I was in|troduced to &s;uch elegance, grandeur, and opulence, as I had no idea of on this &s;ide the atlantic. But as I have had for many years a growing aver&s;ion to the city, and have long &s;ince been anticipating the plea|&s;ures of a rural life; I made no long tarry, but &s;oon retired to the interior parts of the country. As I had determined by travelling to acquaint my&s;elf with the people, of whom I had formed &s;uch an idea: I con|ceived it a natural dictate of prudence, to accompli&s;h this in the fir&s;t &s;tage of my American exi&s;tence: that being free from local prejudices, and having gained a more univer&s;al acquaintance, I might be better able to make a judicious choice with re&s;pect to a &s;ettle|ment. In pro&s;ecuting this plan my opportunity in the &s;tudy of human nature has been con&s;iderable, and I tru&s;t not wholly unimproved. Be the improvement however what it may, I will ri&s;k this the&s;is, as the re|&s;ult of a careful inquiry: that human nature is the &s;ame, in England and America. At this ob&s;ervation
<PB N="5" REF="018944_0005_0FA90BA593AD9518">
I doubt not you will &s;mile, and &s;ay the man is recover|ed of his in&s;anity. I readily confe&s;s my prejudice in favour of America run high, too high, for me to draw an impartial character. I have waited long to feel my&s;elf cool on the &s;ubject: but whether long enough, you will better judge from the &s;equel of my letters. The people of America are ho&s;pitable&mdash; they are &s;ociable&mdash;they are brave as what I conceived &mdash;they are &s;en&s;ible and di&s;cerning to admiration: which has fully convinced me, that popular gover|ments are the mo&s;t friendly to mental improvements. Freedom will rai&s;e, and bondage will &s;ink, the pow|ers of the humam mind. And the &s;ame per&s;on, in this difference of &s;ituation, will make a very different figure in the world. Witne&s;s the black and the white people in this country. The colour has not made the odds; &s;hift their &s;ituations, let the black man be ma&s;ter and the white &s;ervant, and a few gener|ations would turn the &s;cale of &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The country, as to fertility, and variety of produce, fully an&s;wers my expectation. And as to extent and &s;ettlement; it exceeds my imagination warm as it was.</P>
<P>The laws are generally good; but &s;omewhat fail in punctuality of execution. The debt contracted by the war, is not as you imagined any way formida|ble: the re&s;ources of the country, I find abundantly &s;ufficient to di&s;charge it. Nor does the union of the &s;tates, or di&s;po&s;ition of the people at large, threaten a failure. If there is any deficiency in this re&s;pect, it is for want of a &s;uitable power in Congre&s;s, to call forth the&s;e re&s;ources. The people are young and vi|gorous &mdash;their lands are liberal in the &s;upports of life and traffic&mdash;in particular they are exceedingly well
<PB N="6" REF="018944_0006_0FA90BA71930BEE8">
furni&s;hed with the materials of &s;hip-building, at which the people are &s;kilful. This branch of bu&s;ine&s;s af|fords a commodity &s;o vendible in Europe, &s;o import|ant the world over, that if vigorou&s;ly pu&s;hed, would of it&s;elf in no lengthy period of time, di&s;charge the greater part of the debt.</P>
<P>I was bred like your&s;elf in the mid&s;t of great di&s;|tinctions, where with but a glance of the eye, might be &s;een the mo&s;t &s;triking contra&s;t of wealth and pov|erty.&mdash;In America it is not &s;o; there is an equality here, which to an European would be matter of won|der.&mdash;In the country it is u&s;ual for every man to be &s;ettled on his own plantation, and he is lord of what|ever his deed covers; he knows nothing of the exor|bitant demands either of tyrant, bi&s;hop, or landlord. Notwith&s;tanding the ri&s;e of taxes, occa&s;ioned by the war, they are yet light compared with yours. They crowd not (as in England) upon the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life; but leave the indu&s;trious labourer in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both. Back from the &s;ea coa&s;t, they are generally farmers; they retire from the field at night, with an appetite created by moderate exer|ci&s;e; this gives a peculiar reli&s;h to their food and drink, which is plain and whole&s;ome, but not rich. Being &s;trangers to intemperance, idlene&s;s and luxury, and with their &s;en&s;es unimpaired by the fare of high life, they appear to take all the &s;atisfaction the world affords.</P>
<P>As I travel, I often from choice take lodging with this cla&s;s of men, and from their table of plain diet, am more plea&s;ed and refre&s;hed, than I &s;hould be at an entertainment of a lord in England. For here, tho' it be hard to give a rea&s;on, I participate with them in
<PB N="7" REF="018944_0007_0FA90BA9B3260650">
appetite and reli&s;h.&mdash;Here I behold &s;implicity of manners, without mixture of formality, and an hone&s;t hearted genero&s;ity, without the di&s;agreeable &s;how of court parade.&mdash;Here liberty appears to be more than a &s;peculative ideal thing,&mdash;it is a reality. It di&s;cov|ers it&s;elf in the behaviour and countenance of the&s;e men; their whole deportment is different from one that has been bred to fawn at a monarch's feet, or one who&s;e intere&s;t wholly depends on keeping his land|lord in humour.&mdash;I tru&s;t you will not think me fran|tick in this ob&s;ervation: for in your own &s;pecula|tions on human nature, you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved the command which the mind has over the features and deportment of the man. Does not the melancholy &s;oul wear a wrinkled brow? Does not the thief with|out &s;peaking confe&s;s his guilt? And why are not the &s;laves of lord and monarch in like manner vi&s;ible? From the intimacy and unre&s;erved freedom I have had in your company, you are &s;en&s;ible that I am no enemy to matrimonial connections. The &s;ituation, circum&s;tances and manners of my country, are what have &s;o long confined me to a celibic life. I never could feel it duty, to be in&s;trumental of introducing my own &s;pecies to that which was &s;o di&s;agreeable to my&s;elf. My &s;oul has often recoiled at the idea of be|ing father to one who &s;hould be a tenant to a lord, or a va&s;&s;al to a tyrant.&mdash;But methinks the&s;e objec|tions are removed, and I begin to feel the force of duty and inclination without oppo&s;ition. You will therefore not be &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;hould you &s;oon hear of my forming a very &s;erious acquaintance with one of the&s;e farmers daughters. For on all accounts I mu&s;t prefer their education and manner of life, which is for the mo&s;t part neat, frugal and indu&s;trious.&mdash;They
<PB N="8" REF="018944_0008_0FA90BAA0BB6BFB0">
are per&s;ons of good humour; nor has their ta&s;te ever been corrupted by the follies and fopperies of the ci|ty; though at the &s;ame time they are no &s;trangers to good breeding. I have many motives to this choice in particular. I con&s;ider the di&s;po&s;ition in a great mea&s;ure formed by early example; and the different callings that employ mankind, are not without their influence in this re&s;pect. The trader undergoes that &s;hift of fortune and &s;hift of pa&s;&s;ion to which the farmer is not expo&s;ed: hence the&s;e employments are not alike friendly to that calmne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, which is a main pillar in the &s;upport of conjugal hap|pine&s;s. Let a per&s;on be brought up in a family, where the dome&s;tic affairs are conducted in a chole|rick manner, and where pevi&s;hne&s;s in the heads, is frequently &s;een triumphant over rea&s;on: and it is a wonder if the di&s;po&s;ition does not hence receive a di&s;|agreeable tincture. And the &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be made with regard to other defects in human life: it is in this way that family vices are propagated, and handed down from parent to child and from child to grandchild, not only to their own reproach, but to the great detriment of civil &s;ociety. I am therefore governed in this matter, not &s;o much with a view to my own happine&s;s, as the good of a ri&s;ing family: where the mother as &s;he more con&s;tantly pre&s;ides, mu&s;t have a principal hand in forming the children either to virtue or vice. The mother of a family I con&s;ider as the open book, from which the child takes the le&s;&s;on of life. And of what intere&s;ting concern is it then to the&s;e tender minds, that the le&s;&s;on be good, founded on morality and &s;uited to attemper the di&s;po&s;ition, both to private happine&s;s and public u&s;efulne&s;s?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="018944_0009_0FA90BAAD69ED520">It would not be &s;trange if by this time you begin to wonder at my freedom,&mdash;indeed I am &s;urpri&s;ed at my&s;elf, e&s;pecially on a &s;ubject of this delicate nature. At fir&s;t I thought only to have &s;tarted the idea, but have been led in&s;en&s;ibly to the above ob&s;ervations. However you would readily pardon me, had you been witne&s;s to that which of late has &s;o captivated my mind. I have often with re&s;pect to the happi|ne&s;s of life, built ca&s;tles in the air: I have often al|lowed my imagination to rove uncontroled on the &s;ubject: and as often has my judgment and experi|ence da&s;hed the airy bubble, and convinced me that the whole was but an ideal thing, not capable in its nature of being reduced to practice.&mdash;Here among the farmers of America, I behold the happine&s;s of life exemplified beyond whatever rea&s;on or ob&s;ervation taught me before.</P>
<P>For &s;ome days pa&s;t, I have taken my rout farther back in the country than heretofore, which has led me into a territory as yet but thinly inhabited. Here while I am pa&s;&s;ing plains, intervals and mountains, I meet with nothing to di&s;turb my reflections. The &s;oil I ob&s;erve is exceedingly good, and in every point of view inviting to the hu&s;bandman.&mdash;Never did I feel &s;uch tenderne&s;s for the va&s;&s;als of lord and mon|arch as now,&mdash;can it be that &s;o many millions of the human race &s;hould drag out the mi&s;erable remains of life, ignorant that there is any part of the world that will better &s;upport them?&mdash;can there be &s;uch inhu|manity in the great, as to build their grandeur and &s;upport their luxury upon the toil of their fellow-mortals, when the wilds of America invite them to liberty, and where a few years indu&s;try would rai&s;e them to a &s;tate of opulence and independence?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="018944_0010_0FA90BAB82334F08">In the&s;e woods I now and then pa&s;s a log-hou&s;e, around which there are con&s;iderable improvements, proportioned no doubt to the proprietor's indu&s;try, and time of &s;ettlement. I often call and inquire in|to their welfare, and que&s;tion them in the proficiency they make on their new plantations. I came la&s;t evening to one of the&s;e habitations, it was earlier in the day than I would have wi&s;hed to put up; but fearing le&s;t night might overtake me in the wilder|ne&s;s, or le&s;t I might not find an hou&s;e that promi&s;ed &s;o good accommodation, I a&s;ked for entertainment, which was readily granted. The family &s;eemed plea&s;ed to have an opportunity of waiting on a &s;trang|er. My landlord, when he came from the field at night, di&s;covered the &s;ame good humour in his coun|tenance, &mdash;he bid me welcome to his hou&s;e, and to his table of plain diet, which was &s;oon made ready.&mdash; He informed me that it was not more than &s;ix years &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;troke was &s;truck on his farm; and he had then between fifty and &s;ixty acres cleared&mdash;kept an hand&s;ome &s;tock&mdash;rai&s;ed his own wool and flax&mdash; had always after the fir&s;t year a &s;urplu&s;age of grain&mdash; made his own meat, his own dairy and his own ap|parel. &mdash;Indeed, the oeconomy in the hou&s;e appeared to re&s;emble that without. While the father with a little child on his knee was giving me this account, the mother with the daughters were about their do|me&s;tick employment. Each one in the family filled his own place, and contentment and &s;atisfaction reigned through the whole. After family prayer, which was religiou&s;ly attended, I retired to my lodg|ing, with a di&s;po&s;ition better &s;uited to reflection than &s;leep. I fancied my&s;elf to have fallen upon a di&s;co|very, after which the &s;ages of antiquity had &s;ought in vain. And that here in the wilderne&s;s, I had found
<PB N="11" REF="018944_0011_0FA90BAC43FFAA98">
in what the greate&s;t happine&s;s of life con&s;i&s;ted. For here was religion without colour of &s;uper&s;tition&mdash;here was civil and religious liberty in perfection&mdash;here was independence, as far as the nature of human life would admit&mdash;here fulne&s;s was enjoyed in retirement &mdash;and the whole &s;hut out from the di&s;agreeable noi&s;e and bu&s;tle of the world. After we aro&s;e in the morn|ing, my landlord invited me to a walk in the field, where I &s;aw the fruits and effects of indu&s;try united with the be&s;t oeconomy. And finding him to be a very affable &s;en&s;ible man, I a&s;ked him a number of que&s;tions, among the re&s;t, whether he could give any account how far tho&s;e wilds were habitable, and whe|ther the &s;oil in general was in any mea&s;ure to be com|pared to the &s;pot on which he was &s;ettled. This que&s;tion introduced the following narration, which he gave me.&mdash;A friend of his with two others a few years before, &s;et out with a determination to pene|trate the we&s;tern wilderne&s;s, as far as prudence &s;hould direct. They travelled fifteen days for the mo&s;t part on a we&s;terly line, without di&s;covering the lea&s;t trace of any human creature. The wild bea&s;ts would often &s;tart before them, of the&s;e there was a great plenty and a great variety, among which their fire-arms contributed much to their amu&s;ement as well as &s;up|port. On the afternoon of the fifteenth day, when they had travelled not le&s;s than three hundred miles, from any inhabitants, they unexpectedly di&s;covered a large plantation under the be&s;t improvement. In the mid&s;t of this appeared a &s;tately elegant building, in Engli&s;h fa&s;hion. With joy they ha&s;tened to the gate of the high yard, which &s;urrounded this &s;eat. The porter that &s;tood centinel under&s;tood from &s;igns their de&s;ire of admittance&mdash;carried their reque&s;t, and &s;oon returned with liberty of admi&s;&s;ion. They were
<PB N="12" REF="018944_0012_0FA90BADC273CAD8">
received into the family, where they had all the marks of ho&s;pitality &s;hewn them; but were not admitted that night to &s;peak with the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e. In the morning they were invited to his apartment, in an upper loft, where, in addition to their joy, they found him to be a man of their own colour, and one who &s;poke their own language. He &s;ufficiently apo|logized for not waiting on them the evening before. The rea&s;on was, his being employed in preparing a packet for Quebec with re&s;pect to the fur trade, over which he pre&s;ided in that quarter of the world. &mdash;The hi&s;tory of the man in a few words, is this.&mdash; When a child he was bound an apprentice to a gen|tleman in Albany, with whom he lived till he was nineteen years of age; when his ma&s;ter's &s;everity growing intolerable, he privately left him, with a de|termination to &s;eek a retreat in the wilderne&s;s, beyond the &s;earch or information of his ma&s;ter. On his route he fell on this &s;mall village of the natives, with whom he a&s;&s;ociated, and with whom after a few years he was connected in marriage. This with other circum|&s;tances, procured him the confidence, &s;ervice and en|tire obedience of that people, by who&s;e labours he brought under improvement, a tract of land which almo&s;t bounded the eye. He was a man of no educa|tion, could neither read nor write, which proved a very material di&s;advantage to his trade. To remedy this defect, he &s;ent his elde&s;t &s;on to Quebec, who was there furni&s;hed with an education &s;ufficient to tran&s;|act his father's bu&s;ine&s;s, both among French and Engli&s;h. His plantation furni&s;hed his numerous family, with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life in great abun|dance: nor did his trade contribute le&s;s to its con|veniences. &mdash;That here in this remote part of the wil|derne&s;s, was enjoyed almo&s;t every thing the world
<PB N="13" REF="018944_0013_0FA90BAE8747AD90">
affords, and nothing (as he ob&s;erved) was wanting to compleat the happine&s;s of his &s;ituation; but a &s;mall circle of friends with whom he might u&s;e his native language, and &s;pend the vacant hours of life.&mdash;Af|ter the&s;e men had travelled upwards of an hundred miles further, nearly in the &s;ame direction, they re|turned with ob&s;erving, that the whole of this new ex|plored region, was an exceeding rich &s;oil, and by far the mo&s;t level and beautiful of any part of America, that had come within their knowledge.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of this conver&s;ation, I found my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;trange mixture of feelings.&mdash;My pity, gratitude, and joy ran high, &s;o as not a little to di&s;|turb that &s;teadine&s;s of mind, which if po&s;&s;ible I would di&s;cover under all occurrences of life. I could not do le&s;s than cro&s;s the atlantic in imagination, and drop a tear of pity on tho&s;e I had left behind. Many of which were ignorant that there was any &s;uch open|ing as this on the globe; or if known have yet been &s;o long confined in &s;lavery as to feel no inclination or re&s;olution to &s;hake off the chain and make the noble adventure.&mdash;I could not but have a grateful &s;en&s;e of the divine goodne&s;s, in preparing &s;uch a &s;pacious re|treat for the poor and oppre&s;&s;ed of mankind, and di&s;|covering of it in an age of the world, when it was ne|ver more needed. I could not likewi&s;e but feel a joy at the ri&s;ing glory of America. What a foundation is here for a great, la&s;ting and happy empire. In no part of the world was there ever a greater number of natural circum&s;tances, which united to promi&s;e the event; and perhaps in no part &s;o many of a moral kind. Here is no want of territory&mdash;nor is there want of matter on which to ground the be&s;t civil poli|cy. The hi&s;tory of the world is before them&mdash;the
<PB N="14" REF="018944_0014_0FA90BAF52B68700">
public virtues and vices of every nation are laid open to their view&mdash;their ri&s;e and fall, with the operating cau&s;es are carefully noticed, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of their mother country now on the decline, mu&s;t be fre&s;h in mind, and I tru&s;t will ever prove a le&s;&s;on of the mo&s;t &s;alutary in&s;truction. The&s;e among many, are &s;ome of the natural rea&s;ons that excite my joy. And with mode&s;ty may I not attempt the morali&s;t, &s;o far as to ob&s;erve, that as this is the greate&s;t quarter of the world and the la&s;t in di&s;covery, we may here ration|ally expect the la&s;t and greate&s;t works of Deity. I mean tho&s;e which are to be accompli&s;hed in the gold|en age. From &s;ome cau&s;e or other, I am irre&s;i&s;tibly inclined to believe, that this is the hemi&s;phere on which the morning of that day will fir&s;t dawn, and &s;hine back from we&s;t to ea&s;t till the light and know|ledge of the Saviour &s;hall illuminate the world. Will not this, at lea&s;t in part, be a fulfilment of his own words? that the la&s;t &s;hall be fir&s;t and the fir&s;t la&s;t. And to &s;trengthen the idea, may I not bring to view the prophetic de&s;cription of that approaching day: for is not this the wilderne&s;s and &s;olitary place that &s;hall be made glad, and the de&s;ert that &s;hall blo&s;&s;om as the ro&s;e?

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE are many things in theory which are not capable of practical proof; the&s;e as they con|tribute little to the benefit of mankind, I rank in the lower cla&s;s of literature. You doubtle&s;s remember when we were &s;choolmates, how philo&s;ophically our profe&s;&s;or would harangue upon the original particles of matter, and the &s;imples of nature. For my part I find no &s;uch &s;imples; what is there that is uncom|pounded. Univer&s;al nature is a mixture of con|trary ingredients, and to every earthly enjoyment there is a <HI>contra</HI> part annexed; one thing is &s;et over again&s;t the other that man &s;hould find nothing after him.

<P>When I fir&s;t perceived the connection I was form|ing with America, and how in&s;eperably my affection was united to her intere&s;t, I was not in&s;en&s;ible from the nature of things, to what a vici&s;&s;itude of pa&s;&s;ions I was fated. The idea at fir&s;t &s;tartled me; but I at length freely &s;ubmitted, to what my love had made irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>In my former letter I took my leave of you, as if

with Mo&s;es upon the mount, borne away with the ri&s;ing glory of America. I now &s;it down in a more humble &s;tyle; to lay before you tho&s;e threatning &s;ym|toms of a political and moral nature, which pain my heart. In the civil con&s;titution of America, each &s;tate with re&s;pect to its own internal police, holds a &s;overeignty of its own; but for mutual defence, they are organized into one great body, over which then Congre&s;s pre&s;ide, compo&s;ed of a proportionable num|ber of delegates from each &s;tate. In this body was de&s;igned to be lodged the &s;upreme authority of the nation; but being inve&s;ted with their power, at a time when tyranny had rendered the very name of power unpopular, the &s;tates fell &s;hort of the mark, and by their re&s;trictions incapacitated their ruling body, for the di&s;charge of the duty to which the very nature of their office led them. I am &s;en&s;ible that the ruler has no power but what is derived to him from the people; yet the nature of all government requires that he &s;hould have &s;o much as to rule for their good, to encourage the virtuous and puni&s;h the vicious. Congre&s;s in &s;ome things of the greate&s;t importance, have only a right to recommend to their con&s;tituent a&s;&s;emblies, what they judge intere&s;ting to the public weal; and however urgent the exigen|ces of the nation may be with regard to the&s;e, yet they mu&s;t pa&s;s the litigation of each a&s;&s;embly before Congre&s;s are empowered to act; and even then we find it may be the ca&s;e, that one of the thirteen will negative the whole. When I was fir&s;t made acquaint|ed with the powers of Congre&s;s, I was &s;en&s;ible of the defect, and equally &s;en&s;ible that &s;uch was the jealou&s;y of the people, in delegating power to their rulers, that nothing but experience could convince them of the mi&s;take. And experience has already begun

to do its office, and by the irreparable lo&s;s of an immen&s;t intere&s;t, has admini&s;tered more conviction to the po|pulace, than volumes on the &s;ubject would have done. I mean in the continental impo&s;t recommended by Congre&s;s to the &s;everal &s;tates. This was an expedi|ent for canceling the public debt, that di&s;covered great wi&s;dom and &s;ound policy. It would have done honour to the olde&s;t &s;enate on the globe: for it ea&s;es the indu&s;trious farmer and draws the revenue from the opulent; or at lea&s;t being laid upon the &s;uper|fluities of life, no one pays any part of it but of choice.</P>
<P>The &s;tates &s;oon di&s;covered their intere&s;t in this re|commendation, and adopted the plan, all except the &s;tate of Rhode-I&s;land which has negatived the whole. And there being no authority to remedy the evil; or cha&s;ti&s;e their &s;tubbornne&s;s&punc; the nation has already lo&s;t a revenue; I pre&s;ume of greater value than the &s;tate it&s;elf&punc; A few more le&s;&s;ons of &s;uch a &s;erious na|ture as this; will likely convince the people that it is not for their intere&s;t in this manner to re&s;trict the &s;upreme legi&s;lature of the nation. Congre&s;s mu&s;t have more than a name or power of recommendation, in order to act for the good of the whole. However, we may perhaps attribute this defect not &s;o much to a want of wi&s;dom as to tho&s;e inevitable prejudices to which human nature is incident. At the time when America left her parent country and forever di&s;&s;olved that tender relation which had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, it was done under the highe&s;t provocation; there was the greate&s;t affront offered to human rea&s;on and liber|ty: the Briti&s;h mini&s;try given up to a &s;pirit of infa|tuation, a&s;&s;erted a right of making laws binding them in all ca&s;es whatever; from this awful &s;pectre they
<PB N="18" REF="018944_0018_0FA90BB260EF2318">
fled; and in this perturbation of mind, they were driven by the laws of &s;elf pre&s;ervation to form a con|&s;titution of their own. It is not therefore &s;trange under the&s;e circum&s;tances, that a jealou&s;y of power &s;hould be &s;o great as to operate to their di&s;advantage. When with the greate&s;t caution we are endeavouring to &s;hun one extreme, we are almo&s;t certain to &s;trike the other, <HI>humanum e&s;t errare.</HI> Add to this the con|&s;titution of civil government has in all ages of the world been found one of the mo&s;t delicate &s;ubjects on which human wi&s;dom has ever been employed, and the prodigal delegation of power has often been attended with the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equences. That from the&s;e con&s;iderations I rather think it &s;trange, that the &s;tates have not made greater mi&s;takes in their con&s;titution than what at pre&s;ent appear. This apol|ogy for the people you will readily &s;ee re&s;ults from the nature of things, rather than from too great a pre|judice in their favour. You will not impute it to a want of candour on the &s;ubject, though I pa&s;s over many &s;maller matters that are not altogether agreea|ble, for this would introduce a prolixity not &s;uitable in a letter. Was I to give my opinion with re&s;pect to the &s;everal legi&s;latures individually, I &s;hould judge the members which compo&s;e the greater part of their a&s;&s;emblies, much too numerous; if they were le&s;&s;ened half or more, it would expedite their bu&s;ine&s;s with le&s;s expence: nor if done by the voice of the people, could it in the lea&s;t endanger their liberties. But not to enlarge here; I &s;hall take the liberty to ob&s;erve further upon the public oeconomy of the &s;tates. Per|haps never was a people under better advantage to become great and rich than the Americans, or more circum&s;tances be found any where ari&s;ing from &s;oil, climate, and &s;ituation, to render a people indepen|dent
<PB N="19" REF="018944_0019_0FA90BB2FB0F2018">
of the re&s;t of the world. However from prin|ciples of benevolence I am no enemy to commerce, when regulated by wi&s;dom and &s;ound policy. At pre&s;ent the &s;tates appear exceedingly wanting in this oeconomy; and much like the young trader, who&s;e object is to fill his &s;tore without thinking that a day of payment will ever come. The advantage, or di&s;|advantage of trade, depends on two things, the cir|cum&s;tances of a people, and the manner in which it is conducted. There may be natural and perhaps remedile&s;s cau&s;es that render a foreign trade di&s;&s;er|viceable to a people. If they are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of commodities to exchange for what they receive from other nations, and of more than what is nece&s;&s;ary for their own con&s;umption; trade in this ca&s;e will not only rob them of the &s;upports of life, but plunge them into debt. Poland is a living example in proof of this ob&s;ervation; they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;carce any trading commodity, except corn, which is one of their capital &s;upports. The lands are chiefly owned by lords, who oppre&s;s their tenants, and take from them this &s;taff of life, that by it they may feed their own luxury in trade with other nations. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances it would be happy for the Polanders if they had no trade opened with any part of the globe. It is not &s;o with the Americans, they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a variety of commodities, a con&s;iderable proportion of which may be &s;pared in foreign trade, and by exchanging them for the manufactures and produce of other nations, would be greatly to their advantage. But in national trade the exports &s;hould be made to an&s;wer the imports, otherwi&s;e it will for|ever drain a people of their ca&s;h; this will di&s;turb their internal police, and render almo&s;t every member of the community in &s;ome degree uncomfortable.
<PB N="20" REF="018944_0020_0FA90BB3C1111628">
There mu&s;t be public as well as dome&s;tic oeconomy: nor is it po&s;&s;ible for a people any more than a family, to flouri&s;h without it. At pre&s;ent the balance of trade lies exceeding heavy again&s;t the &s;tates, and it is daily increa&s;ing; the evil already operates; the people complain of the great &s;carcity of ca&s;h, but are gener|ally blind to the cau&s;e. In almo&s;t every &s;hip bound for Europe their ca&s;h is exported in large quantities, and there exchanged, at lea&s;t in part, for tho&s;e toys and &s;uperfluities of which nature has no demand, and which tend to empoveri&s;h the buyer as much as en|rich the &s;eller. It would be happy for the &s;tates, was their Congre&s;s con&s;titutionally authori&s;ed to levy a duty upon all European &s;uperfluities, that would either wholly di&s;courage the trade, or if continued &s;erve to lighten their public burden. It is indeed &s;trange that the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;tates has di&s;covered no more jealou&s;y of this bait when laid by an enemy: for the Briti&s;h nation are no more friends to America now, than when their &s;word was un&s;heathed. All their pacific pretentions are but the product of nece&s;|&s;ity; their &s;word failed of conque&s;t, and they are now trying the art of trade; and will you call it a groundle&s;s fear? &s;hould I &s;ay, that there may be more danger from this quarter, than from their arms. I mean not to in&s;inuate by this, that I am under fear|ful apprehen&s;ions le&s;t they may again obtain the ju|ri&s;diction of the &s;tates; but by plunging them deep in debt, bankruptcy will become frequent in the mercantile part of the community, and in every &s;uch in&s;tance the public is more or le&s;s injured, not only as it robs them of their ca&s;h, but as it will give Great Britain a foothold in their landed property. For when the commodities and ca&s;h of the &s;tates fail, this mu&s;t &s;ecure the creditor; on this is grounded the above
<PB N="21" REF="018944_0021_0FA90BB5C9068FE8">
ob&s;ervation, that there may be more danger from Briti&s;h trade than Briti&s;h arms: for by the latter they conquered no part of America, but by the former they may acquire much. It is ea&s;ier for us to injure another under the di&s;gui&s;e of friend&s;hip, than when there is no &s;uch artifice made u&s;e of to hide the intent. Hence the wi&s;e precaution of the Trojan prie&s;t again&s;t receiving the Grecian hor&s;e within their walls, <HI>Timeo Danaos dona ferentes.</HI> Trade naturally carries with it the pretext of friend&s;hip, though like the above mentioned hor&s;e it may be charged with death. Great-Britain is crowding in her goods of every kind upon the &s;tates, and the people blind to the fraud ap|pear equally zealous in purcha&s;ing. It would be greatly for their intere&s;t, would they look forward to the approaching evil that mu&s;t hence re&s;ult, depend more on their own manufactures, and purcha&s;e no|thing but what nece&s;&s;ity demands.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t of a people has a greater concern in their ta&s;te for living than we are apt to imagine; when this is conformed to, and governed by their circum&s;tances, it is happy, and no le&s;s pernicious when &s;uffered to run at large without any &s;uch rule. When a private per&s;on or family, live beyond their circum&s;tances, trouble will inevitably follow, and the ob&s;ervation is equally true with re&s;pect to the public. America lives too fa&s;t for a people &s;o young, who have &s;o lately pa&s;&s;ed their minority, and who&s;e op|portunity for acquiring wealth as yet, has been &s;o &s;mall. It di&s;covers a bad ta&s;te and great vanity, to think at pre&s;ent of imitating older nations in their &s;uperfluities and grandeur. Every thing of this na|ture &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed till their public debt the price of their redemption is fully di&s;charged. The com|monality
<PB N="22" REF="018944_0022_0FA90BB7502E41F8">
take the higher rank of people for the &s;tand|ard of fa&s;hion, and governed by a fal&s;e ta&s;te, they car|ry the imitation to the great detriment of their pri|vate as well as the public intere&s;t. Hence the plough boy is ruffled, and the kitchen maid in her head-dre&s;s, rivals the lady of fortune; and hence it is, that Great Britain finds &s;uch a market in America for tho&s;e gaudes and nen&s;en&s;ical &s;uperfluities, which are a moth to the world. Did this rank of people conceive the influence which their example has on the public welfare, I am &s;ure if friends to their country, they would &s;tudy the greate&s;t &s;implicity and frugali|ty of life. I readily confe&s;s the idea I had formed of America in this re&s;pect was imaginary. When I left my native country, I indulged the plea&s;urable thought of leaving all the follies and fopperies of fa&s;h|ion behind me; I fancied the American ta&s;te too noble and philo&s;ophic to be endangered by any thing in its nature &s;o perfectly empty; but to my great grief I find that the&s;e have followed, or rather gone before me into the country, where I expect to &s;pend the re&s;idue of my life. I am now travelling through the &s;tate of Connecticut on my way ea&s;tward; a few evenings pa&s;t I took lodging at a plantation about twenty miles from one of their market towns, I was told the town had lately been incorporated with city privileges. My landlord I found in ill humour, ex|pre&s;&s;ing not a little di&s;content, with regard to the difficulty of the times; it is natural for me when troubles of any kind appear, to examine into the cau&s;e; in this in&s;tance an indirect method of coming at the matter appeared the mo&s;t fea&s;ible. I therefore ob|&s;erved to him, that the country had obtained the ob|ject of their conflict, their army was now di&s;banded, in con&s;equence of which their public taxes were much
<PB N="23" REF="018944_0023_0FA90BB7F6D0DE10">
lightened: and be&s;ide his farm appeared exceeding good and well managed; and that under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances we might rationally &s;u&s;pect whether his complaints were not groundle&s;s. The good man replied, that in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ea&s;on of the war, when he had a &s;oldier to hire and equip for &s;ervice, and when public taxes were the heavie&s;t, he could with much more ea&s;e and punctuality di&s;charge his obli|gations than now. The pork, beef and grain rai&s;ed on his farm and carried to market, had annually di&s;|charged his public taxes;&mdash;he ob&s;erved that few Eu|ropean manufactures were then in the country, and &s;carce any of the &s;uperfluous kind: they were hence nece&s;&s;itated to indu&s;try within doors, and to follow the &s;tricte&s;t rules of family oeconomy. They manu|factured their own apparel, both for male and female with very little exception, and it was then decent and reputable in any company; but would now &s;carcely an&s;wer for a common dre&s;s. My landlord was par|ticular in relating to me the time and circum&s;tances that fir&s;t introduced his troubles; he had a large fa|mily of &s;ons and daughters, two of which not long after the declaration of peace made a vi&s;it to the city, &mdash;they di&s;covered plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction when they went from home, but returned with a very different countenance. The affectionate father immediately inquiring into the cau&s;e found it to be this;&mdash;the &s;on had met with an acquaintance of his in the city, who was dre&s;&s;ed in a very genteel &s;uit of broadcloth and &s;ilk;&mdash;the daughter &s;aw a lady walking the &s;treet with a new fa&s;hioned hat, ornamented with &s;ome remarkable tor&s;els, and one of the mo&s;t beauti|ful feathers &s;he ever &s;aw. They found the &s;tore where they were to be &s;old, inquired the price, which they &s;aid was exceeding low. The good man repli|ed
<PB N="24" REF="018944_0024_0FA90BB9821B5268">
to his &s;on that his dre&s;s was &s;uch as they could af|ford, it was neat, plain and manly; and that his cha|racter either as a man of &s;en&s;e, or whole&s;ome mem|ber of &s;ociety, would never &s;uffer from this quarter. And turning to his daughter he ob&s;erved, that they had a great variety of poultry on the farm&punc; among which there was a rich diver&s;ity of colours, and &s;he might pluck a feather from which &s;he plea&s;ed, would &s;he only be content. But arguments availed little&punc; the di&s;content di&s;turbed the tranquility of the hou&s;e till the articles were purcha&s;ed; the&s;e brought into the family; had the like effect upon the other children. The di&s;&s;atisfaction which the partial hand of a parent creates&punc; began to di&s;cover it&s;elf in a very &s;erious man|ner. The old gentleman now &s;eemed driven by ne|ce&s;&s;ity to go the round in the trade he had begun, and he ob&s;erved it had ever &s;ince been little &s;hort of a continued round of fa&s;hions, introduced by the new city on which they bordered. The &s;upport of fa&s;h|ion he found to be the heavie&s;t tax that he ever paid; the produce of his farm had always cleared him of the others, but in this it failed. The incomes and charges of his family he found to le&s;s and le&s;s compare, and the balance again&s;t him daily increa&s;ing. He told me that if this lo&s;s of intere&s;t had been &s;upplied with an increa&s;e of family happine&s;s, the exchange would give him no trouble; but the rever&s;e of this was in truth the ca&s;e; dome&s;tick happine&s;s had for&s;aken him; contentment the near companion of &s;implicity and frugality was no more. His family was like the ve&s;&s;el in a troubled &s;ea, to&s;&s;ed from fa&s;hion to fa&s;hion, ever reaching after new and &s;atisfied with none. He lamented this great and &s;udden corruption of ta&s;te; the difficulty of &s;temming the torrent; and that the in|tere&s;t he had acquired by hard indu&s;try, &s;hould in this manner be wa&s;ted by prodigality.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR intimate acquaintance with &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory, has doubtle&s;s led you to ob|&s;erve, that nations have their character as well as individuals: the criterion of di&s;tinction is perhaps no le&s;s vi&s;ible in the one than in the other. In na|tions we find that now and then one, will &s;tep forward of their fellow-mortals, and in the regi&s;ter of &s;ame rank high above the re&s;t. It is &s;o likewi&s;e in the great family of Empires: one will &s;ometimes take the lead of the re&s;t in power, riches and honour, yea, in every point of view that will &s;erve to characteri&s;e a nation as great. This di&s;tinction is not accidental, but ari&s;es from their moral and political virtue; or better to expre&s;s my idea, their religion in this re&s;|pect is their policy; it is the operating cau&s;e, ex|cept in tho&s;e in&s;tances where God rai&s;es up a people for a temporary &s;courge, that they may fall in their turn, when this work is accompli&s;hed. The Jewi&s;h nation exemplifies the a&s;&s;ertion: nor is the A&s;&s;yrian monarchy le&s;s in favour of the exception. The dif|ferent religions that have been embraced by differ|ent nations, is not only an evidence of human depra|vity, but it likewi&s;e di&s;covers the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome religion in every body politic. It was from this principle that the king of the ten tribes, on their re|volt from the hou&s;e of David, deified his golden calves. He was &s;en&s;ible that if the religion of Judah was adopted for theirs, in the new con&s;titution they

were forming, it would endanger his throne; and be|ing equally &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome religion was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of civil government, he e&s;tabli&s;hed that of idolatry, though again&s;t the light of con&s;cience and revelation. Civil laws without the laws of re|ligion, have little influence on the mind: it is the latter which principally gives energy to the former. The more enlightned heathen convinced of this, had their prie&s;ts who inculcated on the people the doctrine of the &s;oul's immortality, and a future &s;tate of retri|bution; they found this to be the be&s;t engine in &s;up|port of civil policy; and being either ignorant of or unfriendly to revelation, their invention from age to age was employed on the &s;ubject, as a matter in which national intere&s;t is nearly concerned. Nor did they fall in their de&s;ign&mdash;their religion, bad as it was, rendered their laws more energetic and influenc|ing on the people: hope and fear the ruling pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, were kept alive in this way; and being directed by their religion to a future world had that power over the community, that no civil laws could have had without it.&mdash;The hi&s;tory of the Roman and Grecian republics, is a living example of this truth. But we who are favoured with the go&s;pel, and live in this enlightened age of the world, have no need to em|ploy our invention on the &s;ubject&mdash;the work is done to our hand, and it is done by unerring wi&s;dom: And notwith&s;tanding the object of this religion is far more &s;ublime than the &s;upport of civil government, yet from no quarter does civil government receive &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as from this.&mdash;Indeed &s;hould we like the dei&s;tical civilian view it only in this point of light, as an engine to civil policy, all the wi&s;dom of the heathen &s;ages that has ever been employed on the &s;ubject, appears but folly. For there is no moral

This is connecting private happine&s;s with the public good; and this my friend is the religion of the Sa|viour; &mdash;there never was any artifice made u&s;e of by the wi&s;e&s;t politician, that was &s;o naturally calculated for the good of civil &s;ociety:&mdash;it is &s;o on the princi|ples of rea&s;on, were we to leave a &s;uperintending pro|vidence out of the que&s;tion.&mdash;If then &s;ome religion is nece&s;&s;ary for every body politic, and if the chri&s;tian religion (I mean as held by the prote&s;tants) is found to be the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent and &s;alutary in its tenden|cy; it is of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting concern to a people, that this be laid as a foundation &s;tone, on which to build their con&s;titution. I am far from entertaining the idea that the great end of religion is to give en|ergy to civil law: for this would be to &s;ubordinate the greater to the le&s;s. The de&s;ign of civil government is to &s;ecure the lives, liberties and properties of the &s;ubjects, and to aid and protect them while pa&s;&s;ing through this world to a better. Certainly then the legi&s;lator that makes civil government the ultimate object of religion, mu&s;t invert the order; nor, upon his own principles, does he le&s;s mi&s;take his policy when he does not frame the con&s;titution in favour and

The American &s;tates like the new mar|ried pair are &s;etting out for them&s;elves in the world; their con&s;titutions are formed and forming by their &s;everal legi&s;latures; and as it is of importance to the one, &s;o is it to the other, that they &s;et out right, and are agreed in the principles of religion: for &s;amene&s;s of religion has a natural tendency to &s;trengthen the bond of union.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed to find that &s;ome of the &s;tates in their con&s;titutions di&s;cover a &s;acred regard to religion; nor am I le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ed to find it neglected by o|thers, even where I &s;hould have lea&s;t imagined &s;uch a defect.&mdash;The &s;tates of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire have in effect &s;evered it from their con|&s;titution; their new code of laws neither &s;upport a public wor&s;hip, nor that religious profe&s;&s;ion who are ordained by heaven to wait at the altar; at lea&s;t after the pre&s;ent cla&s;s are gone off the &s;tage.&mdash;Surely they have forgotten the God to whom they &s;o lately ap|pealed in their di&s;tre&s;s; otherwi&s;e they could not in this public manner have given up his wor&s;hip, and withdrawn the civil &s;upport from that order of men appointed to &s;acred office. Such policy as this will prove de&s;tructive in whatever &s;tate it is admitted; it will gradually root out a learned and able clergy; bring public wor&s;hip not only into neglect, but con|tempt; hence immoralities of every kind will pre|vail, which like a mortal con&s;umption will prey up|on the &s;eat of politic life. I am no bigot to any par|ticular per&s;ua&s;ion, while I believe in my own, I al|low my&s;elf neither to di&s;pi&s;e or ridicule that of ano|ther. I am therefore fond of the general toleration that is given in the &s;tates to every denomination of

chri&s;tians, both upon the principle of &s;ound policy and the real &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity; for a man's mind is his kingdom, and if liberty is ever de&s;irable, it is in the choice of that religion on which we build the &s;alvation of the &s;oul. But this is altogether differ|ent from parting with religion by whole&s;ale: let the chri&s;tian wor&s;hip be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the con&s;titution, and then let every man wor&s;hip according to the dictates of his own con&s;cience: for the civil commu|nity cannot flouri&s;h without it, where this is wanting, the laws like the parts of a di&s;tempered body will cea&s;e to do their office, when di&s;&s;olution in a cour&s;e of nature mu&s;t follow. Could we therefore di&s;card the idea of a future world from the &s;ubject, it would be of great advantage to the community to &s;upport the chri&s;tian wor&s;hip: for it pre&s;erves order&mdash;begets mutual love&mdash;and tends to breathe into every &s;ub|ject tho&s;e principles of duty and morality which are of the la&s;t importance to the public weal. <HI>There is,</HI> &s;ays Solomon, <HI>that &s;cattereth and yet increa&s;eth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tend|eth to poverty.</HI> And never perhaps is this ob&s;ervation more &s;trikingly exemplified than in the ca&s;e before us, experience will &s;oon convince the abovementioned &s;tates, that they have mi&s;taken their policy and hit wide of the mark at which they aimed. However I am le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to wonder at New-Hamp&s;hire than Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts in this matter, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that the latter as it is older, larger and more opulent, &s;hould influence the former in their politics, e&s;pecial|ly when we con&s;ider them bordering on each other.

But from per&s;onal acquaint|ance, I find this happy period gone&mdash;their civil and religious order, as is always the ca&s;e, have fled toge|ther&mdash;their &s;abbaths are de&s;pi&s;ed&mdash;and that God who&s;e name I mention with reverence, is profaned in their &s;treets. I lament the apo&s;tacy, and &s;incerely pity the people rendered unhappy by their own folly. My former affection often urges me to believe, that their wi&s;dom cannot overlook the cau&s;e of this un|happine&s;s; and I &s;hould hence be induced to expect a reformation, was I not &s;en&s;ible how hard it is in this re&s;pect to recover lo&s;t ground. When vice is &s;e|cured and bound by law, it is difficult to conceive that the rulers of a people can be too watchful and &s;trict in keeping of it confined; a little relaxation of the cord may appear trifling, and is often plead for as nece&s;&s;ary, but viewed in its tendency it is a kind of high trea&s;on,&mdash;it is at lea&s;t an indirect attempt up|on the commonwealth;&mdash;in this way vice by &s;low degrees gets at helm, and the community after many painful and perilous &s;truggles is often &s;hipwrecked. I have ob&s;erved while pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;tates, that the legi&s;lative authority appear much better to fill their place than the executive. The laws are general|ly whole&s;ome, and pointed with a manly &s;pirit again&s;t whatever may threaten the good of the community: but the informing officers, and tho&s;e entru&s;ted with the execution of the laws, have for &s;uch a cour&s;e of time been lax in their duty, that the zeal which the commonwealth demands of them, has in &s;ome re&s;pects

It is much ea&s;ier to compile than to ex|ecute the law;&mdash;men therefore of the greate&s;t &s;tabi|lity, and who are lea&s;t tempted by the bait of popu|lar applau&s;e, &s;hould be entru&s;ted with the execution of the law. It is a common defect in civil policy, that too little attention is paid to the appointment of informing and executive officers; by the&s;e means whole&s;ome laws often fail of being executed; and this tends to bring both the law and legi&s;lature into contempt,&mdash;yea it enervates the whole politic &s;y&s;tem. I have often thought it better for the community to have a law, however &s;alutary in its nature, wholly re|pealed, than to &s;tand in force without execution. It will be plead I am &s;en&s;ible that it is a re&s;traint on &s;ome; but when we con&s;ider the mi&s;chief that it does to other laws, and the wound it gives to civil authority, I believe the di&s;advantage here ari&s;ing to the commu|nity, will be found to preponderate. I am likewi&s;e led to conceive, that informing and executive officers are no le&s;s criminal for their deficiency in tru&s;t, than the open violators of law, who through their neglect pa&s;s with impunity. Men who in this manner are &s;et as centinels to guard the commonwealth, are en|tru&s;ted with a charge of the mo&s;t weighty kind, their fidelity can &s;carcely be too much applauded, or their neglect too &s;everely reprobated. Is not an a&s;&s;ault up|on a &s;ingle life, a crime that ju&s;tly kindles our in|dignation again&s;t the inhuman perpetrator?

<PB N="36" REF="018944_0036_0FA90BC4FAC760E8">
the&s;e &s;peculations I have &s;pread before you, with that unre&s;erved freedom peculiar to friend&s;hip: yea I have expre&s;&s;ed to you the exerci&s;es of my heart, with all the impartiality of which I am ma&s;ter. In the leave I am now taking of my friend, you will doubtle&s;s wi&s;h to know in what part of America a letter may hereafter find me. This choice of &s;ituation, you likely remember, I re&s;erved for an after period, when I ex|pected a&s;&s;i&s;tance from an acquaintance with the whole. My purpo&s;e I confe&s;s is different from what it then was: I find it impo&s;&s;ible to take up my re&s;idence in any town through which I have pa&s;&s;ed, without too great a connection with tho&s;e things which to me fall among the di&s;agreeables of the world. The bu&s;tle and confu&s;ion which attends a city life, is to me ex|ceeding irk&s;ome; or to become a &s;lave to the fa&s;h|ions of the town, and undertake their ta&s;k of ceremo|nious flattery in which my tongue was never &s;killed, would be no le&s;s di&s;agreeable. I am therefore re&s;olv|ed on a rural life of the mo&s;t retired kind; in the we&s;tern wilds of America there is extent &s;ufficient for my retreat: here beyond the reach of fa&s;hion or cor|ruption of ta&s;te, I mean to bring up my family, which at pre&s;ent have but an ideal exi&s;tence. As tho&s;e un|located lands &s;ettle fa&s;t, I expect to travel far in or|der to execute my de&s;ign. I &s;hall take with me a &s;elect number of friends, in the collection of which I u&s;e the greate&s;t precaution: though a &s;mall, yet we propo&s;e to go in &s;ome re&s;pects an organized body; for we have an able preacher of the go&s;pel, and no le&s;s able in&s;tructer for our children, who are engaged in the adventure. Here by the leave of providence I purpo&s;e to try how far indu&s;try connected with the greate&s;t &s;implicity of habit and manners, will con|tribute to the happine&s;s of life. Since I have been
<PB N="37" REF="018944_0037_0FA90BC5C4D7A3A8">
in the country, I have paid no &s;mall attention to the art of farming; I have learned how to fell the timber, and have acquired the u&s;e of almo&s;t every in&s;trument of hu&s;bandry: I have con&s;ulted the be&s;t &s;ea&s;ons for &s;owing the &s;eed, and the &s;oil mo&s;t &s;uitable for each particular kind; and as I expect to devote my&s;elf to this agreeable employ, I hope by experience, with what little philo&s;ophy I am ma&s;ter of, to become a tolerable proficient. Should you object to my plan as di&s;covering a want of benevolence, and think me fleeing from tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary burdens, in which I ought to &s;hare in common with my fellow citizens; I have only to ob&s;erve that I am no politician, and therefore conceive of little good I could do the pub|lic, however much I might intere&s;t my&s;elf in its con|cerns. In the execution of this de&s;ign, my pro&s;pect of doing good is con&s;iderable, that in my view of the matter, benevolence is much in my favour. The force of bad example by theori&s;ing on the &s;ubject, I have conceived to be very great: but this experi|ment I expect will give the <HI>quantum,</HI> or &s;how how great it is. I have been told that a child, meerly for the &s;ake of experiment, has been brought up wholly &s;ecluded from means of knowledge, and as much as po&s;&s;ible from human &s;ociety: but this would be to brutalize and not to humanize the mind. Our view is wide from any thing of this nature; for we carry with us the be&s;t means both of human and divine knowledge: our object is to evade that corruption of ta&s;te and fa&s;hion, which di&s;tempers the politic &s;y&s;|tem and preys upon the happine&s;s of dome&s;tic life. And although we expect that human depravity will accompany the adventure, yet we hope to e&s;cape tho&s;e outward immoralities, which to the &s;hame of rational <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, prevail in town and city. A very

laudible attention to the education of youth, appears to be general through the &s;tates: but after all the good which it promi&s;es, there is this evil which at|tends it, the child is &s;o conver&s;ant with the popular ta&s;te, his eyes &s;o frequently turned on bad exam|ple&punc; that the&s;e nece&s;&s;arily become a part of his edu|cation. The latter we expect wholly to e&s;cape, while the former is carried to its highe&s;t perfection. From a family or community bred up in this manner I con|fe&s;s I have the mo&s;t rai&s;ed expectation; indeed the pro&s;pect in almo&s;t every point of view looks promi&s;|ing. I am &s;en&s;ible that there are conveniences and I may add nece&s;&s;aries of life, which our lands will not produce, to obtain which we de&s;ign to open a trade with the neare&s;t market town: but in the u&s;e of the&s;e we &s;hall be exceeding frugal, as the di&s;tance of tran&s;|portation will render them expen&s;ive. The trade is to be conducted only by tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t at|tached friends to our &s;implicity, that the idea of for|eign &s;uperfluities may forever be withheld from our children; or at lea&s;t to the time when age and the force of education &s;hall fortify them again&s;t the temp|tation. As my di&s;po&s;ition has undergone no materi|al change &s;ince I left London, you will not &s;u&s;pect this enterpri&s;e to ari&s;e from any &s;our un&s;ociable turn, which I have newly taken; for friend&s;hip and free|dom I more and more admire, at the &s;ame time am more and more convinced that this lies within the circle of a few: and that an attempt to enlarge the limits, or indulge intimacy with tho&s;e unacquainted with the delicacy of friend&s;hip, would be rather an in|let to pain than plea&s;ure. My views I am &s;ure are not ambitious; I am not &s;eeking the honour of one that is the founder of an empire; nor to have the little community which I have the honour to collect,

<P>You will &s;urely gratify me &s;o far as to &s;uffer your imagnation for a moment to accompany my retreat into the&s;e we&s;tern wilds. How happy thus to retire from the confu&s;ion of the world, and as it were by one leap to e&s;cape its greate&s;t di&s;agreeables. Here nei|ther ambition to fill the &s;eats of the great, nor fear of being di&s;placed from offices of honour and profit can di&s;turb the mind; indu&s;try the companion of virtue and happine&s;s will be our dependence.

You will not object to the di&s;tance of my retreat, if you have properly philo&s;ophi&s;ed on the matter; for the &s;pot of earth on which we &s;ettle, &s;imply con&s;idered, is no way e&s;&s;ential, the attendant properties are what mo&s;t con|tribute to the happine&s;s of life.
