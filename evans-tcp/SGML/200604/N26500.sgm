<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we explore the exten&s;ive regions of the globe, and contemplate the many plants which the benefi|cent di&s;po&s;er of all things has given as u&s;eful ornaments to the earth, and at the &s;ame time reflect that through the ig|norance or indolence of man, many of tho&s;e valuable &s;ub|jects are permitted to wither in our fields or fore&s;ts, without ever attracting the attention of tho&s;e mortals, for the alle|viation of who&s;e corporeal infirmities they were indubita|bly intended, many unplea&s;ant ideas mu&s;t naturally intrude them&s;elves on our minds&mdash;Regret is awakened in our brea&s;ts at the inactivity of our ance&s;tors, who&s;e unpardona|ble &s;loth has &s;uffered di&s;ea&s;es to exi&s;t as <HI>opprobria medicinae</HI> for the relief of which many plants inconte&s;tibly flouri&s;h, and which from inattention or &s;ome other omi&s;&s;ion equally culpable, die neglected, and an&s;wer no valuable purpo&s;e but to fertilize the &s;oil which gave them birth.</P>
<P>The free inhabitants of the United States of America, would merit additional cen&s;ure were they to evince a &s;imi|lar &s;upinene&s;s. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of pre-eminent advantages for rendering valuable acqui&s;itions to the Materia Medica, their neglect of &s;uch pur&s;uits would prove a national di&s;grace, and be con&s;idered by their po&s;terity equally criminal as the mo&s;t heinous offence again&s;t civil government.</P>
<P>Inhabiting a va&s;t extent of territory, it would be arraign|ing divine goodne&s;s, not to &s;uppo&s;e, that he has be&s;towed with a liberal hand, &s;ources of alleviation to tho&s;e mi&s;eries, which were incurred by the lo&s;s of our primeval innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="035230_0009_10017DEA0C6DDE98">It has been ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by a very learned author,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rollin's Arts and Sciences.</NOTE> that, "the &s;trength of a &s;tate is not to be computed by extent of country, but by the number of its citizens, and the utility of their labour." This &s;hould actuate us in the pur&s;uit of u&s;eful knowledge, &s;o as to render the extent of country which we inhabit more u&s;eful and more wealthy, whereby, not only our literary character as a nation, but al&s;o our li|berty and independence will be effectually e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>That there are plants diffu&s;ed all over the great conti|nent of America, endued with the mo&s;t active medical vir|tues, is incontrovertible; but to u&s;e the words of the poet,
<Q><L>Full many a flower is born to blu&s;h un&s;een,</L>
<L>And wa&s;te its &s;weetne&s;s on the de&s;ert air.</L></Q></P>
<P>The indu&s;try and wi&s;dom of man are now the only re|qui&s;ites to develope tho&s;e virtues, and render them benefi|cial to mankind.</P>
<P>To the honour of our infant republic, the &s;cience of me|dicine has been laudably promoted by the invaluable ac|qui&s;itions of the profe&s;&s;or of botany and materia medica in the univer&s;ity of Penn&s;ylvania, with a view to cultivate an in|timate acquaintance with the indigenous plants of this coun|try.&mdash;The literary fame of this gentleman is too well known to require any eulogy from my pen; he has with as much ingenuity as indu&s;try, paved the way to facilitate the future re&s;earches of men of &s;cience, and in language peculiarly plea&s;ing and de&s;criptive, has given an agreeable animation to u&s;eful facts, &s;o as to render them not only grateful to the reader, but al&s;o truly beneficial and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Were candidates for medical honours to pur&s;ue this laudable example of their preceptor, they would enrich the
<PB N="11" REF="035230_0010_10017DEC30E51318">
Materia Medica with many valuable articles; but, unfor|tunately for this branch of &s;cience, a depraved predilection for the thread worn &s;ubject of di&s;ea&s;es, tempts them to launch their bark into the dangerous &s;ea of controver&s;y, and frequently without the nece&s;&s;ary implements for the effectual execution of &s;uch an undertaking.</P>
<P>Attracted by the o&s;tentatious glare of hypothetical rea&s;oning, they frequently adopt with avidity theories the mo&s;t extravagant and fallacious, and without examining the &s;olidity of the opinions they embrace, confide entirely to the judgment of others, and with the greate&s;t temerity ri&s;que their reputation on that un&s;ub&s;tantial ba&s;is.</P>
<P>When philo&s;ophy &s;hall be e&s;teemed an indi&s;pen&s;able appendage to the medical character, then &s;hall &s;uch incon|veniences cea&s;e to exi&s;t. The &s;u&s;ceptible mind of man, enlightened by the rays of philo&s;ophy, will then di&s;&s;ipate the clouds of ignorance, and experimental enquiries &s;hall then be cheri&s;hed as the &s;ure&s;t vehicles to truth.</P>
<P>I have been prompted to adopt the &s;ubject of Nico|tiana, not from any vain idea of my ability to do ample ju&s;|tice to the medical qualities of this plant, but from an an|xious &s;olicitude to contribute my mite towards the promo|tion of one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful branches of &s;cience, and I tru&s;t that from this con&s;ideration, my experiments and opi|nions will be examined with an eye of lenity, but, at the &s;ame time, with candour and impartiality. I have to regret extremely, that a &s;erious indi&s;po&s;ition, for near two months, unfortunately precluded my entering as minutely into the analy&s;is of Tobacco, as I at fir&s;t contemplated; but I have endeavoured to atone for this deficiency, by attending par|ticularly
<PB N="12" REF="035230_0011_10017DEE66FE5490">
to its influence on the &s;y&s;tem, and al&s;o to the re|&s;pective operations of its con&s;tituent parts.</P>
<P>The exhibition of Nicotiana, as a medicine, for the mitigation of many di&s;ea&s;es to which mankind are incident, has been unfortunately but little attended to by phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>The deleterious effects with which it is endowed, and the &s;uppo&s;ed danger of exhibiting it on this account, have led medical characters to depreciate the worth of a medi|cine, who&s;e benign influence, by a judicious admini&s;tration, in eradicating certain di&s;ea&s;es, has, in many in&s;tances, been evidently confirmed.</P>
<P>It has been declared, by &s;ome &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers, to be u&s;ele&s;s, from the repeated proofs of its inefficacy in mi|tigating the violence of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, in which, many more accurate inquirers have a&s;&s;erted it proved beneficial. Others have alledged, that the baneful powers, with which it is re|plete, di&s;&s;uade from an u&s;e of it. In con&s;equence of the&s;e chimerical a&s;&s;ertions, a medicine which would prove a valua|ble acqui&s;ition to the Materia Medica, has been almo&s;t en|tirely expunged from modern practice.</P>
<P>If we were to admit &s;uch injudicious opinions to go|vern our rea&s;on, in &s;electing medical plants, how few would be the number which would engage the attention of the timid and injudicious practitioner! for in the hands of &s;uch only are powerful medicines rendered injurious, and in the hands of &s;uch al&s;o the mo&s;t lenient prove obnoxious. The invaluable aphori&s;m of Dr. Withering, therefore, merits the attention of every practitioner of medicine; he ju&s;tly ob|&s;erves, that, "poi&s;ons in &s;mall do&s;es are the be&s;t medicines, and the be&s;t medicines in too large do&s;es are poi&s;onous."</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="035230_0012_10017DEFEBC5B040">It would be as incon&s;i&s;tent to &s;tigmatize this plant with the appellation of poi&s;on, as it would be to pronounce a crum of bread noxious in its quality, becau&s;e it has in &s;ome ca&s;es entered the trachea, and occa&s;ioned in&s;tantaneous death.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ions which I have formed on the &s;ubject which con&s;titutes the &s;ub&s;equent pages of this di&s;&s;ertation have been founded on experiments, and tho&s;e experiments, though few, have been conducted with accuracy. They have been mutually the &s;ources of much mental di&s;quietude, and the diffidence I now feel in &s;ubmitting them to the &s;cru|tiny of the learned, tends con&s;iderably to augment the di&s;|agreeable emotions which, at this time, di&s;turb my tran|quility: however, I &s;hall con&s;ider my&s;elf richly compen|&s;ated for every inconvenience, &s;hould any word or thought contained in the&s;e pages prove propitious in exciting &s;ome more accurate ob&s;erver to a more minute inve&s;tigation of this copious &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>NATURAL HISTORY.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I. The natural hi&s;tory of Tobacco, and of its fir&s;t introduction as an article of luxury.</HEAD>
<P>WE have accounts, in different authors of &s;everal &s;pecies and varieties of this plant, but as an accurate de|&s;cription of them may be acquired in almo&s;t every botanical book, it would be altogether u&s;ele&s;s for me to enter into an elaborate definition of each in particular. I &s;hall therefore confine my&s;elf to that &s;pecies which is thus de&s;ignated by the great Linnaeus, "<HI>Nicotiana Tabacum:</HI> foliis lanceolato|ovatis &s;e&s;&s;ilibus decurrentibus, floribus acutis."</P>
<P>It is termed by Ca&s;par Bauhin, <HI>Nicotiana major lati|folia.</HI> According to the natural method of Linnaeus, it be|longs to the 28th order, called <HI>Luridae.</HI> Among the abori|gines of the continent of America, it was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of <HI>paetum,</HI> whil&s;t tho&s;e who inhabited the i&s;lands, called it <HI>yoli</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Encyclopedia.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>According to Sir Hans Sloane<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Hans Sloane's Natural Hi&s;tory of Jamaica.</NOTE>, its original name was <HI>picielt,</HI> but was termed <HI>tobacco</HI> by the Spaniards, from the circum&s;tance of its being brought from the i&s;land of <HI>Tobago,</HI> where it grew almo&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Tobacco was fir&s;t introduced into Europe in the year 1559 by John Nicot, lord of Villemain, who was agent
<PB N="15" REF="035230_0014_10017DF540D7B6A8">
in Portugal for the King of France, from whence he brought the plant, and pre&s;ented it to the Queen: from this circum&s;tance it was called <HI>Herba Regina,</HI> and in honor of him <HI>Nicotiana</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Theatrum Botanicum, page 711.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Lobel and others accounted this, as well as the other &s;pecies of Nicotiana, an <HI>Hyo&s;ciamus</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Theatrum Botanicum.</NOTE>, and called it <HI>Hyo&s;cia|mus luteus</HI> and <HI>dubius,</HI> in con&s;equence of which &s;ome have given it the Engli&s;h name of <HI>yellow Henbane.</HI> It is arranged by Linnaeus in his fifth cla&s;s, <HI>Pentandria Monogynia</HI> the <HI>&s;ta|mina</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of five <HI>&s;ubulated filaments,</HI> topped with ob|long <HI>antherae</HI>; the <HI>&s;tyle</HI> ri&s;es from the rudiment of the fruit &s;ingle. The flowers are large and of a beautiful red, and annexed to long and &s;lender foot-&s;talks: they are of a <HI>monopetalous tubelous</HI> form, and grow on the tops of the branches, and of the main &s;talk; the tube is longer than the cup, and the limb which &s;preads open is divided into five acute-pointed &s;egments.</P>
<P>The <HI>cap&s;ule</HI> which &s;ucceeds the flower is bivalved and bilocular, is al&s;o large, and of an oval form: it opens longitudinally, and &s;heds extremely minute &s;eeds, but very numerous.</P>
<P>The root is divided into many parts, grows very thick and long, and is furni&s;hed with an infinity of &s;mall fibres. The growth of this plant is generally from five to &s;ix feet in height, but &s;ometimes more, depending upon the &s;ea&s;on, and fecundity of the &s;oil. The &s;talk is &s;ub&s;tantial, round, very erect, and divided into branches. The leaves are large, numerous, and di&s;tributed in an alternate manner:
<PB N="16" REF="035230_0015_10017DF776D78D00">
they are of a deep green, and have petioli, or foot-&s;talks, but &s;urround the common &s;talk, in great part at their ba&s;e.</P>
<P>Tobacco is a native of America, and was fir&s;t &s;ent to Spain and different parts of Europe, for the purpo&s;e of or|namenting their gardens, but &s;o great was the demand for the dried leaves, that it at length became an article of com|merce, and is at this pre&s;ent period almo&s;t univer&s;ally re|&s;orted to as a <HI>luxury.</HI></P>
<P>The Indians formerly made u&s;e of it as a <HI>vulnerary,</HI> and a&s;cribed many virtues to it as a medicine. They entertain an idea, that tobacco was brought them down from the hea|vens by the Great Spirit, who de&s;cended for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of pre&s;enting them with this plant, in order that it might be &s;pread throughout the land for the benefit of their &s;pecies. Hence many nations of that tribe, make u&s;e of it in certain forms of their religion.&mdash;It is called by them <HI>Eche.</HI></P>
<P>Travellers a&s;&s;ert, that they often re&s;ort to the <HI>great mountain,</HI> where the angel appeared, and do homage to that &s;pot, on which their ance&s;tors fir&s;t received &s;o divine a plant.</P>
<P>It is alledged by Sir Hans Sloane,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Hans Sloane's natural hi&s;tory of Jamaica.</NOTE> "that the prie&s;ts of E&s;paniola, called <HI>Bohitis,</HI> who are medical characters as well as theologi&s;ts, make a practice of chewing and &s;moking to|bacco, until they become perfectly inebriated, and in this &s;ituation they perform many ge&s;ticulations, pretending like|wi&s;e to recount for the will of God, what they have &s;een." They feign al&s;o to perfect radical cures among many of the di&s;ea&s;ed, and &s;o prejudiced are the people in their favour, as to imagine them&s;elves perfectly relieved. The form
<PB N="17" REF="035230_0016_1001649EB1741090">
which they ob&s;erve on this occa&s;ion, as related by Sir Hans Sloane, is in the following &s;ingular manner; "when they attempt to cure, they &s;hut them&s;elves up with the &s;ick, &s;ur|round him, &s;moking him with the &s;ame; &s;uck out of his &s;houlders what they &s;ay was his di&s;ea&s;e, &s;hewing a &s;tone or bone they kept in their mouths, which the women keep as relicks, thinking they facilitate birth."</P>
<P>Thevet affirms that the women among the Aborigines of America were led away with an idea, that indulging in the u&s;e of tobacco was not only injurious to the body, but that it al&s;o prevented <HI>conception,</HI> and tended greatly to dimini&s;h the <HI>venereal appetite</HI>; in con&s;equence of which, they for|bore the u&s;e of it in any form whatever.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e attributed many virtues to this plant, and pronounced it a powerful <HI>counterpoi&s;on</HI>; hence they have given it the appellation of <HI>Herba Santa.</HI></P>
<P>Sir Richard Greenfield, on his di&s;covery of Virginia in 1585, ob&s;erved that the Indians made great u&s;e of tobac|co in clay pipes, for the pre&s;ervation of their health. Plea&s;|ed with the novelty of the circum&s;tance, he took &s;everal of the pipes with him on his return to England, which were introduced into court: others were made agreeable to their con&s;truction, and from that period the u&s;e of &s;moking &s;oon became general.</P>
<P>It was fir&s;t introduced among the Oriental nations by the Dutch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Hans Sloane.</NOTE> &s;eamen, who u&s;ed to carry pipes about them made of palm leaves, in which they &s;moked to ea&s;e their wearine&s;s, as well as &s;u&s;pend a di&s;po&s;ition for food.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="035230_0017_10017DF8FB6CB520">The Indians after having gathered their crop of to|bacco, hang it up in their hou&s;es for the purpo&s;e of curing, after this is perfected, they take four or five leaves, and wrap them up in the great leaf of a tree, in the form of a funnel; they then apply fire to the extremity, and inhale the &s;moke, which being frequently repeated, cau&s;es them to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t three or four days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is univer&s;ally acknowledged that tobacco does not impart any degree of nouri&s;hment to the body, but on the contrary tends greatly to <HI>reduce obecity</HI>; yet &s;uch is its &s;timulating quality, that it &s;upports the &s;y&s;tem for &s;everal days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, above what may be termed the <HI>hungry point.</HI> This is taken notice of by Mr. Kerr<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kerr. Lond. Med. Ob&s;er.</HI> vol. v. art. 28.</NOTE>, with re&s;pect to opium. "The ea&s;tern nations," &s;ays this author, "are &s;o well convinced, by experience, of its powers in dimini&s;hing the appetite, that in the famine which prevailed in the Ea&s;t-Indies, in the year 1770, the wretched &s;ufferers purcha&s;ed it at exhorbitant prices, to allay the cravings of hunger, and &s;mooth the approach to death."</NOTE>, without partaking of any aliment. They practi&s;e this more particularly, when they contemplate going to war, or are about to predict the termination of fu|ture important events. It is con&s;idered by them as the mo&s;t valuable offering that can be made to the beings that they wor&s;hip. They u&s;e it in all their civil and religious ceremonies. When once the &s;piral wreaths of its &s;moke a&s;cend from the feathered pipe of peace, the compact that has been ju&s;t made, is con&s;idered as &s;acred and inviolable. Likewi&s;e when they addre&s;s their Great Father, or his guardian &s;pirits, re&s;iding, as they believe, in every extraor|dinary production of nature, they make liberal offerings to them of this valuable plant, not doubting but that they are thus &s;ecured of protection<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Encyclopedia.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. A conci&s;e account of the influence of Tobacco, on living &s;y&s;|tems, illu&s;trated by a few experiments.</HEAD>
<P>That tobacco is both a powerful emetic and cathartic, when exhibited in any form whatever, is generally admit|ted: we find that all authors, who have written on its effects, have unanimou&s;ly concurred in this opinion; &s;ome have al&s;o &s;ub&s;cribed to its being efficacious in promoting the re|nal di&s;charge; but with re&s;pect to its <HI>&s;edative</HI> or <HI>&s;timula|ting</HI> effects on the living &s;y&s;tem, various opinions have hi|therto exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;agacity and experience of Doc|tor Fowler in many re&s;pects, the influence of Nicotiana on the human &s;y&s;tem, in regard to its &s;timulating quality, en|tirely e&s;caped his attention.</P>
<P>After drawing &s;everal inferences, relative to the opera|tion of this medicine, in a concluding part of his work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fowler on Drop&s;y.</NOTE>, he ob&s;erves, that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;edative quality<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A &s;imilar opinion was formerly entertained of opium; but the ingenious experiments of Doctor Crumpe, mu&s;t &s;ufficiently de|mon&s;trate, to every unprejudiced mind, the <HI>&s;timulating quality</HI> of that medicine; and that its <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed &s;edative effects,</HI> are &s;olely to be at|tributed to a &s;econdary operation, or <HI>indirect</HI> debility induced by its immen&s;e &s;timulating property, when di&s;proportioned to the <HI>excita|bility</HI> of the &s;y&s;tem.</NOTE>, and fre|quently proves laxative: on this account he &s;uppo&s;es that
<PB N="20" REF="035230_0019_10017DFD6D965578">
it may prove &s;alutary in many painful ca&s;es, where co&s;tive|ne&s;s may render opiates exceptionable.</P>
<P>That it is a laxative, I have almo&s;t uniformly ob&s;erved, but with re&s;pect to its being endued with a &s;edative quality the &s;ub&s;equent experiments will greatly invalidate.</P>
<P>It is not my intention or wi&s;h to enter into the field of controver&s;y on this head, and therefore I have attempted to define by experiments, the unequivocal operation of this plant. It is unque&s;tionably the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial ba&s;is on which we can found our arguments, and to &s;uch we mu&s;t ultimately appeal for the attainment of truth.</P>
<P>The &s;timulating effects of tobacco did not e&s;cape the di&s;cerning eye of Doctor Cullen, who&s;e opinions &s;hould ever be viewed with veneration and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>In treating of this plant, he ob&s;erves, that "the infu&s;ion of tobacco when it is carried into the blood ve&s;&s;els, has &s;ometimes &s;hewn its &s;timulating powers exerted in the kid|neys; and very lately we have had it recommended to us as a powerful diuretic of great &s;ervice in drop&s;y<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cullen's, Materia Medica, page 191.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>That tobacco promotes the <HI>renal</HI> di&s;charge, is beyond a point of controver&s;y. Every practitioner of medicine who has ever had occa&s;ion to admini&s;ter it, either in the form of infu&s;ion or &s;ub&s;tance, mu&s;t have ob&s;erved its <HI>diu|retic</HI> influence on the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="035230_0020_10017E00442FDA88">This is &s;ufficiently exemplified in the work of Doctor Fowler<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Fowler on Drop&s;y, page 72, where he ob&s;erves that out of one hundred and fifteen ca&s;es in which he admini&s;tered tobacco, in ninety-three of them it proved diuretic.</NOTE>, to whom we are greatly indebted for the &s;eries of experiments enumerated by him. He has clearly demon|&s;trated the influence of tobacco in promoting the urinary &s;ecretion, and has as per&s;picuou&s;ly evinced the utility of its exhibition in violent ca&s;es of A&s;cites, Ana&s;arca, and Dy&s;ury.</P>
<P>Without a further di&s;qui&s;ition relative to the operation of tobacco on the human &s;y&s;tem, I &s;hall proceed with enu|merating my experiments, and will leave it to the candid reader to judge how far they may merit his attention; they de&s;erve at lea&s;t the credit of being faithfully related.</P>

<P>I continued &s;moking without ce&s;&s;ation, until the twen|ty-fifth minute, when I perceived a con&s;iderable nau&s;ea at my &s;tomach, and an evident moi&s;ture on my forehead, ac|companied with repeated eructations.</P>
<P>I now vomited very profu&s;ely, and on the thirtieth minute my pul&s;e became frequent and low. Every thing appeared in a circuitous motion, and I was compelled to &s;eek relief from my pillow for a few moments, until relieved of this dizzine&s;s. On the thirty-fifth minute the vomiting was repeated, and I took a draught of cold water, which mitigated every &s;ymptom. I felt &s;o much relieved, that I got up and walked acro&s;s the room. I experienced at the fortieth minute a tremulous affection of my hands, and a giddine&s;s and pain in my head; &s;o much &s;o, that I was com|pelled to lie down again: the former of the&s;e affections continued for near two hours, but the latter was &s;omewhat abated, after being in a recumbent po&s;ture for a few mo|ments. My pul&s;e &s;till continued depre&s;&s;ed, frequent, and quick; at the &s;ixty-fifth minute my thir&s;t was urgent, my pul&s;e dimini&s;hed three, &s;till languid, and head-ach increa&s;ed. I then drank a gla&s;s of water, and in &s;eventy-five minutes, my pul&s;e was re&s;tored to its natural &s;tate, but the pain in my head &s;till continued.</P>
<P>From the preceding experiments we may infer, that the <HI>primary</HI> effects of tobacco, are to accelerate the pul&s;e,
<PB N="26" REF="035230_0025_10017E0AC73F54D8">
and elevate the &s;pirits; and that its &s;econdary operation is to depre&s;s the former, and &s;ubdue the latter: for it is to be uniformly ob&s;erved in the preceding, as well as many of the &s;ub&s;equent experiments, that, after the fir&s;t half hour had elap&s;ed, the number of pul&s;ations, in a given time, continu|ed to dimini&s;h, until reduced to, and frequently below<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This gave origin to the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed &s;edative effects</HI> of opium.

Doctor Cullen<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cullen's Materia Medica, vol. 2. page 151.</NOTE>, in &s;peaking of the <HI>commotion</HI> generated in the &s;y&s;tem, from the exhibition of narcotics, ob&s;erves, that to explain this operation, "it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome other cau&s;e than the direct &s;timulant power of the &s;ubstance applied; and it appears to be that re&s;i&s;tance and con&s;equent activity, which the ani|mal oeconomy is &s;uited to oppo&s;e to every application that has a tendency to hurt it. This power is well known in the &s;chools of phy&s;ic, under the title of the <HI>Vis Con&s;ervatrix et Medicatrix naturae</HI>; which however difficult to explain, mu&s;t, as a general law of the animal oeconomy, be admitted as a matter of fact."</P>
<P>In contemplating the &s;entiments of Doctor Cullen on this head, we mu&s;t pay homage to his great ingenuity, but at the &s;ame time, mu&s;t not allow our veneration for the abili|ties of this illu&s;trious phy&s;ician, to operate as a barrier to the admi&s;&s;ion of truth.</P>
<P>We know that the &s;y&s;tem appears perfectly tranquil when in the enjoyment of health, and that this depends up|on
<PB N="27" REF="035230_0026_10017E0D0EACCE30">
a ju&s;t ratio of <HI>excitement</HI> and <HI>excitability</HI>; but when either predominate, di&s;ea&s;e is invariably the con&s;equence. As this is admitted, would it not be more ju&s;t to &s;uppo&s;e, that this di&s;organization of the human frame, depends upon the &s;timuli applied, being <HI>di&s;proportioned</HI> to the <HI>excitability</HI> of the &s;y&s;tem?</P>
<P>Do we not &s;ee &s;imilar commotions generated in per&s;ons, on the immediate application of <HI>heat,</HI> after expo&s;ing them|&s;elves to inten&s;e <HI>cold,</HI> and thereby rendering their &s;y&s;tems extremely <HI>excitable?</HI> And may not the &s;ame be extended to <HI>narcotics,</HI> when di&s;proportioned to the <HI>excitability</HI> of the &s;y&s;tem?</P>

<P>Mo&s;t of the ancient authors who have written on this &s;ubject, avail them&s;elves of an opportunity to mention the exhilarating effects of tobacco; and Sir Hans Sloane in particular ob&s;erves, that,

author affirms, that Montezumo, or the Emperor, drank &s;everal &s;orts of liquor, richly perfumed with &s;alutiferous herbs; after his meals, he took a kind of chocolate, and &s;moked tobacco perfumed with liquid amber.

<P>We find that its indi&s;criminate u&s;e as a luxury not un|frequently proves injurious. "Its <HI>narcotic</HI> fumes," &s;ays Dr. Leake, "will &s;tupify the brain, and <HI>deaden the invi|gorating power of the nerves upon the whole bodily &s;y&s;tem.</HI> The propen&s;ity of per&s;ons to the u&s;e of this noxious plant, after being once habituated to the impre&s;&s;ion of its &s;timu|lus, is equally prevalent with that of dram-drinkers, to &s;pi|rituous

<P>As I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more particularly of its baneful influence in a &s;ub&s;equent part of this work, when treating of its noxious effects in &s;moking, &s;nuffing, and chewing, I &s;hall for the pre&s;ent &s;u&s;pend my opinions on this head.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the deleterious effects of tobacco hi|therto enumerated, its operation as a medicine frequently proves &s;alutary; this has been clearly demon&s;trated in many violent ca&s;es of ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;e, and as &s;uch it is to be held in the highe&s;t e&s;timation. Its influence on the &s;y&s;tem is immen&s;e. It is beneficial in &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es from its <HI>diuretic quality</HI>; in others as a <HI>&s;udorific,</HI> and it proves in proper do|&s;es, a <HI>gentle emetic,</HI> and a <HI>lenient purgative:</HI> hence the pro|priety of its u&s;e in many other di&s;ea&s;es. But more of this hereafter.</P>
<P>Having now enumerated its re&s;pective operations on the human &s;y&s;tem, I &s;hall proceed with relating &s;ome experi|ments which were made on living &s;y&s;tems, both internally as well as externally.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. Ob&s;ervations on the noxious effect of tobacco on the human &s;pecies, when u&s;ed in the form of &s;moking, &s;nuffing, and chewing.</HEAD>
<P>THE u&s;e of tobacco as an <HI>article of luxury,</HI> in all its noxious forms, comes now to be con&s;idered; but before entering into the particulars of each, I mu&s;t beg leave to offer a few preliminary ob&s;ervations. It is generally admit|ted that "man is an imitative animal;" to adopt, there|fore, from the example of others, what is plea&s;urable to
<PB N="33" REF="035230_0032_10017E1ABA6061B8">
our feelings, or &s;ubordinate to u&s;e, &s;hould not be deemed &s;trange: but that a <HI>rank and noxious weed,</HI> at fir&s;t loath&s;ome to the &s;en&s;e of ta&s;te, as well as prejudicial to the con&s;titu|tion, &s;hould, by habit become de&s;irable, is a circum&s;tance the mo&s;t extraordinary, affording one &s;triking in&s;tance, a|mong many, "of the folly and infatuation of the human mind, and the force, and prevalence of cu&s;tom oppo&s;ed to &s;en&s;e and nature."</P>
<P>Without entering further into an enquiry on this head, I &s;hall at once commence with &s;ome few remarks on to|bacco, when u&s;ed in the form of &s;moking.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who habituate them&s;elves to the immoderate u&s;e of this plant, &s;ooner or later, experience its noxious powers, by the many di&s;agreeable emotions excited by its influence over the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Smoking in particular, by its &s;timulating effects on the mucous follicles and &s;allavary glands, ab&s;tracts profu&s;e|ly their contents, and excites immoderate expectoration: Hence its influence in inducing <HI>dy&s;pep&s;ia</HI>; for by ab&s;tract|ing that liquid,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h's M.

It is alledged by Dr. Cullen in his materia medica,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cullen's Materia Medica, p. 189.</NOTE> that this plant evidently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a <HI>narcotic power,</HI> and through this

means, weakens the tone of the &s;tomach in &s;uch a manner as to preclude the performance of its re&s;pective functions.</P>
<P>From the preceding experiments, it has been a&s;cer|tained, that nicotiana po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;trong <HI>&s;timulant</HI> qualities, and therefore, Dr. Cullen's <HI>narcotic power,</HI> is to be explain|ed by the &s;timuly being carried too far, and thereby induc|ing <HI>indirect debility.</HI> To corroborate this po&s;ition, I will relate the following &s;ingular fact, which not long &s;ince came under my own in&s;pection.</P>
<P>A young gentleman, after being &s;omewhat intoxicated by drinking of wine, undertook for the fir&s;t time, the &s;moking of a &s;egar; after having inhaled it as long as he could with &s;afety to his mouth, he ob&s;erved that it was cu&s;|tomary for gentlemen to fling away the remaining part of the &s;egar; but, for his part, he thought it extremely incon|&s;i&s;tent, and highly improper, and, as he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, to &s;hew his oeconomy, would put it to a better u&s;e, by chew|ing, rather than part with &s;o <HI>ine&s;timable a trea&s;ure:</HI> but unfortunately for the poor youth, he had not gratified him|&s;elf long in the enjoyment of his lu&s;cious mor&s;el, before he fell pro&s;trate on his back, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of all the &s;urrounding company, until they recognized the cau&s;e of &s;o unexpected a tran&s;ition. He was conveyed to an adja|cent room, where he remained apparently lifele&s;s for a con|&s;iderable &s;pace of time, and would probably have fallen a martyr to his folly and imprudence, had not medical aid been near at hand: The attendant phy&s;ician accurately in|&s;pected his ca&s;e, and very properly ab&s;tracted twelve or four|teen ounces of blood from his arm;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor All&s;ton, of South-Carolina, informed me, that he was called to a lady, who had intentionally taken a do&s;e of laudanum, for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troying life. He ha&s;tened to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and immediately admini&s;tered a vomit, but without producing the de&s;ired effect. The do&s;e was repeated and with the &s;ame re&s;ult. He then ab&s;tracted a few ounces of blood, and vomiting immediately en&s;ued, which re&s;tored the woman to health.</NOTE> when a vomiting en|&s;ued,

attended with a profu&s;e diaphore&s;is, which happily di&s;&s;ipated every doubt of his recovery, and &s;oon re&s;tored the youth to his former &s;tate of &s;alubrity.</P>
<P>We may infer from this fact, the infinite power of ni|cotiana, when u&s;ed by tho&s;e who have never been accu&s;|tomed to its noxious effects.</P>
<P>Smoking has been alledged by &s;ome authors to have oftentimes proved advantageous in di&s;pelling contagion of almo&s;t every de&s;cription; but others have oppo&s;ed this a&s;&s;er|tion, with &s;uch valid arguments, and have produced &s;uch &s;ub&s;tantial facts in &s;upport of their opinions, that it is now almo&s;t univer&s;ally believed, that tobacco po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no &s;uch virtue.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed with &s;ome few remarks on &s;nuf|fing, another form in which the deleterious effects of Nico|tiana are evidently depicted.</P>
<P>Snuffing, like that of &s;moking, may, by many repeti|tions, be rendered perfectly &s;imple and harmle&s;s with re|&s;pect to its nau&s;eating powers at fir&s;t, &s;o that its peculiarities may at length be totally di&s;&s;ipated: tho' even this does not evade the force of its action over tho&s;e who practi&s;e its u&s;e in certain quantities, for we find that tho&s;e very per&s;ons accu&s;|tomed to the taking of &s;nuff, by exceeding the portion li|mited, are attacked with every di&s;agreeable &s;ymptom,
<PB N="36" REF="035230_0035_10017E2190D5D468">
which they &s;o evidently experienced on the fir&s;t employ|ment of it.</P>
<P>"On this &s;ubject" &s;ays Dr. Cullen, "it is to be re|marked that the power of habit is often unequal; &s;o that per&s;ons accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of tobacco, a le&s;&s;er quantity, than what they had been accu&s;tomed to, will often have &s;tronger effects than had before commonly appeared. I knew a lady who had been for more than twenty years ac|cu&s;tomed to take &s;nuff, and that at every time of day; but &s;he came at length to ob&s;erve, that &s;nuffing a good deal be|fore dinner, took away her appetite: and &s;he came at length to find, that a &s;ingle pinch, taken any time before dinner, took away almo&s;t entirely her appetite for that meal. When however, &s;he ab&s;tained entirely from &s;nuff before dinner, her appetite continued as u&s;ual; and after dinner, for the re&s;t of the day, &s;he took &s;nuff pretty freely, without any inconvenience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Culien's Materia Medica, page 187.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>This is further corroborated by an a&s;&s;ertion of Doctor Ru&s;h's<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Profe&s;&s;or Ru&s;h's M. S. Lectures.</NOTE>. "I once attended a gentleman," &s;ays the Doctor, "who had been for &s;ome time troubled with pains in his &s;tomach, attended with a diminution of appetite, and &s;ome degree of emaciation. I ob&s;erved that he frequently prac|ti&s;ed the taking of &s;nuff, to which I attributed his di&s;ea&s;e, and advi&s;ed him to &s;u&s;pend the u&s;e of it. He accordingly did &s;o, and &s;oon began to mend very fa&s;t. I was informed by him, a few weeks after, that he had gained thirty weight in fle&s;h, and was at that period, in the enjoyment of per|fect health."</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="035230_0036_100164A0381C51A0">It greatly injures the organs of &s;melling, as the infini|ty of nerves, which are diffu&s;ed throughout the mucous membrane of the no&s;e, on which depends its &s;en&s;ibility, and the acutene&s;s of our &s;melling, become con&s;iderably impair|ed by the acrimony of &s;nuff. "The u&s;e of this &s;ubtile powder, is further rendered odious by di&s;colouring the &s;kin contiguous to the no&s;e, and will taint the &s;weete&s;t breath with the rank odour of a tobacco-ca&s;k. For this rea&s;on the ladies of fa&s;hion in France, &s;eldom take &s;nuff till they are married; a very high compliment no doubt to their hu&s;bands."</P>
<P>"The only advantage," &s;ays Dr. Leake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leake on the vi&s;cera, page 69.</NOTE>, "of tak|ing &s;nuff, is that of &s;neezing, which, in &s;luggi&s;h, phlegmatic habits, will give univer&s;al concu&s;&s;ion to the body, and pro|mote a more free circulation of the blood; but of this benefit, &s;nuff-takers are deprived, from being familiar with its u&s;e."</P>
<P>Chewing, the mo&s;t odious form in which nicotiana can po&s;&s;ibly be u&s;ed, next engages our attention.</P>
<P>The con&s;tant chewing of tobacco impairs the appe|tite, in a &s;imilar manner to &s;moking, from a profu&s;e di&s;|charge of &s;aliva by expectoration<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Cullen ob&s;erves that "this practice is al&s;o the occa&s;ion of the greate&s;t wa&s;te of &s;aliva; and the effects of this in weaken|ing dige&s;tion, and perhaps from thence e&s;pecially, its noted effect of producing emaciation may appear. Cullen's Materia Medica, page 190.</NOTE>, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the body, particularly in per&s;ons of a thin habit.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="035230_0037_10017E23B40AD870">The nau&s;eous ta&s;te of the plant being more imme|diately ab&s;tracted by this proce&s;s, than either of the others hitherto mentioned, precludes its being carried &s;o far by tho&s;e who have recour&s;e to it, without con&s;iderable danger attending &s;uch a procedure. Per&s;ons, therefore, who are de&s;irous of effecting their cuds in this <HI>polite accompli&s;hment,</HI> are compelled to be extremely particular in regard to the quantity, and time of u&s;ing it, for if continued too long with a <HI>novice in this art,</HI> we find evident marks of its oc|ca&s;ioning extreme anxiety, vertigoes, &s;tupors, and di&s;orders of the &s;en&s;es. Notwith&s;tanding the greate&s;t caution of tobacco-chewers, a &s;mall portion of the &s;aliva, tinctured with this plant, will frequently in&s;inuate it&s;elf into the &s;to|mach, and thereby impair the functions of that vi&s;cus.</P>
<P>As longevity depends on a healthy &s;tate of this organ, being one of the mo&s;t important throughout the animal oeconomy, the habits of tho&s;e who addict them&s;elves to this pernicious cu&s;tom become vitiated, and con&s;equently, the number of their days are con&s;iderably &s;hortened. But, as the u&s;e of tobacco in this form, mo&s;t generally prevails among the vulgar, upon whom friendly admonitions are too frequently thrown away, I &s;hall not dwell long on the &s;ubject; well knowing the great difficulty of eradicating prejudice from ignorant minds, though a circum&s;tance much to be regretted.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. Of the prejudicial effects of the u&s;e of Tobacco on the moral faculty.</HEAD>
<P>The general demand for tobacco, as an article of luxu|ry, is owing, I am convinced, to a &s;ervile attachment for
<PB N="39" REF="035230_0038_10017E2536A3BB60">
imitation. Many cu&s;toms equally odious, have of late be|come fa&s;hionable from the &s;ame cau&s;e, and it is to be regret|ted, that men who&s;e exalted &s;ituations in life ought to have rendered them &s;uperior to &s;uch weakne&s;&s;es, have been the principle propagators of the&s;e pernicious practices. The ex|ample of &s;uch characters is, unfortunately, e&s;teemed by per|&s;ons in the more &s;ubordinate walks of life, as the &s;tandard of human perfection; hence when vicious cu&s;toms are brought into u&s;e by men of this de&s;cription, the impre&s;&s;ion which is made on illiterate minds is more durable, and the pro&s;pect of eradicating them more gloomy.</P>
<P>This plant was fir&s;t introduced into England by Sir Walter Raleigh, about the year 1585; this nobleman u&s;ed it in the form of &s;egar, and hence the de&s;picable habit of &s;moking was &s;peedily contracted by the inhabitants of that kingdom.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, our forefathers, mu&s;t have borrowed this cu&s;|tom from the aborigines of America, as we are informed, the&s;e Savages u&s;ed it long before it was introduced into the civilized world.</P>
<P>Our ance&s;tors then, have entailed one of the mo&s;t odious vices on their &s;ons and daughters; for &s;orry am I to ob&s;erve, that this plant is u&s;ed by females, as well as males.</P>
<P>Their delicate habits, it was to have been hoped, would have prevented them from the luxurious u&s;e of &s;uch a nau&s;eous weed, but fatal experience has taught us, that our expectations were merely the re&s;ults of benevolence; with exalted notions of female delicacy, blended with a natural affection for the &s;ex, we fondly anticipated, that they would
<PB N="40" REF="035230_0039_10017E2761372C80">
pre&s;erve them&s;elves aloof from &s;uch a dete&s;table cu&s;tom, and therefore expected that a &s;egar would never find ad|mittance within their ruby lips.</P>
<P>How far the&s;e expectations have been reali&s;ed, expe|rience will declare.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of this plant is not &s;olely confined to tho&s;e la|dies, who have pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of life, for in &s;uch a ca&s;e the evil would not be &s;o great, but the young and the bloom|ing al&s;o delight in inhaling the fumes of tobacco; from this &s;ource we may expect much mi&s;chief, for as habit will render this weed as e&s;&s;ential to their happine&s;s, as their daily food; &s;o al&s;o we will naturally &s;ee the ri&s;ing generation, fondly allured to a &s;imilar attachment.</P>
<P>It is granted that &s;moking, or chewing, univer&s;ally produce thir&s;t, therefore a de&s;ire for &s;trong drink is excited; and as the&s;e, when taken between meals, are generally the forerunners of intemperance and drunkenne&s;s, &s;o al&s;o is vice univer&s;ally the con&s;equence. This is proved beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, by Dr. Ru&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h's E&s;&s;ays, page 270.</NOTE> in his ob&s;ervations on the u&s;e of tobacco; he ob&s;erves its influence in pro|moting intemperance, in the following words&mdash;"One of the greate&s;t &s;ots," &s;ays the Doctor, "I ever knew, acquir|ed a love for ardent &s;pirits, by &s;wallowing cuds of tobacco, which he did, to e&s;cape detection in the u&s;e of it, for he had contracted the habit of chewing, contrary to the advice and commands of his father. He died of a drop&s;y under my care in the year 1780."</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="035230_0040_10017E2A6794C830">From this fact we &s;ee, in the mo&s;t undi&s;gui&s;ed manner, the pernicious effects of this weed, not only on the morals, but on the health, and ought we not then to endeavour to wean our&s;elves from the u&s;e of a plant, which evidently im|pairs our ability for living as rational beings, and in&s;ures for us an early grave?</P>
<P>We daily witne&s;s the horrid effects of inebriety, in our intercour&s;e with the world; a train of evils are pro|duced, which totally di&s;qualify the &s;laves of it from living in the poli&s;hed walks of &s;ociety; they become objects of pity, and contempt, by men of genius and worth, and be|ing excluded from the &s;ociety of &s;uch, they fly to the haunts of vice, and frequently end their days, in a tavern or a brothel.</P>
<P>Idlene&s;s is al&s;o generated by the u&s;e of tobacco, and though it cannot be con&s;idered &s;o immediately de&s;tructive to health and moral rectitude, as the habit of drunkenne&s;s, yet the effects are equally exten&s;ive, though &s;lower in their operation. The &s;ocial duties of life are neglected, and every thing valuable and intere&s;ting is totally di&s;regarded.

<P>The&s;e are generally the effects of a &s;ervile fondne&s;s for tobacco; and I could enumerate many more, if my time would admit, which are equally di&s;gu&s;ting in their na|ture; however, as cu&s;tom has rendered this plant &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial

I vomited four times, viz. at the 20th, 35th, 50th and 90th minutes. This vomiting was as violent, as I have ever experienc|ed from tartar emetic. During the whole time I belched a great deal.

<P>The brea&s;t of a pigeon was punctured, and the orifice filled up with &s;everal drops of the oil of tobacco. In five minutes the legs were &s;eized with an inability for motion. The brea&s;t was now its only &s;upport, and it continued in this &s;ituation, for forty minutes. It indicated great pain the whole of this time, and was &s;urpri&s;ingly convul&s;ed.

<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on the Experiments.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have already taken notice of the particular operation of tobacco, on the human &s;y&s;tem, in a preceding part of this work, I &s;hall avoid prolixity by referring to tho&s;e pages,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pages 32 and 33.</NOTE> where an accurate definition has already been offered; the inferences of which are drawn from &s;everal of the preceding experiments. I &s;hall, therefore, without further comment pa&s;s them over, and proceed to an exami|nation of the fifth experiment, where we have an opportu|nity of ob&s;erving the &s;timulating effects of tobacco, when applied externally to an irritable &s;urface.</P>
<P>In reviewing the &s;ixth experiment, we find that Ni|cotiana proves a gentle emetic, when externally applied to the body, which fact is al&s;o corroborated, by an experi|ment of my friend Mr. Dart's, already taken notice of. In ca&s;es where internal emetics may be objected to, this appli|cation may be adopted with little or no inconvenience, par|ticularly as its operation is of a very lenient nature.</P>
<P>In regard to the experiments made on the mice, it is to be ob&s;erved, that death was almo&s;t an immediate attendant on each. I di&s;&s;ected &s;everal of the&s;e animals after the ex|tinction of life, in order to &s;ee if I could trace any marks

of inflammation. In two or three that I opened, no vi&s;ible effects were produced; in others, the minute blood ve&s;&s;els throughout the inte&s;tines, were &s;omewhat florid, but perhaps this might have proceeded from &s;ome other cau&s;e. Here it may be pre&s;umed, that the <HI>exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulating quality</HI> of this plant, was di&s;proportioned to the <HI>excitability</HI> of their &s;y&s;tems, and con&s;equently death was induced, before any <HI>in|flammatory type</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly have taken place.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ru&s;h remarks that the &s;ame frequently occurred, with per|&s;ons who died &s;uddenly of the yellow fever. "It is owing," &s;ays this acute phy&s;iologi&s;t, "to a <HI>&s;udden pro&s;tration</HI> of the &s;y&s;tem, before the <HI>exi&s;tence of morbid action,</HI> without which no inflammation can take place."</NOTE></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the con&s;tituent parts of tobacco, we find, agreeable to the eleventh experiment, that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an extract con&s;i&s;ting of a gum and re&s;in, two ounces of which afforded three drachms of pure re&s;in. From the &s;e|veral experiments that I have made, the mo&s;t active proper|ty of this plant con&s;i&s;ts in the re&s;inous portion.</P>
<P>The a&s;hes obtained from the twelfth experiment, yield|ed a large portion of vegetable alkali, as is &s;ufficiently con|firmed from the te&s;ts enumerated. The fourteenth expe|riment afforded cry&s;tals of the carbonate of pot-a&s;h and common &s;alt; from the fifteenth was obtained the &s;ulphate of alumine.</P>
<P>Cry&s;tals of the oxalic acid, were procured from the &s;ixteenth experiment. The &s;eventeenth afforded a water ex|tremely pungent when applied to the tongue, and the oil which floated on its &s;urface was very acrid, when in contact with a denuded &s;urface of the body. We may perceive from
<PB N="57" REF="035230_0056_10053E1AB7D92E20">
the re&s;ults of the 18th and 19th experiments, the difference exi&s;ting between the gum and re&s;in, for both of the men on whom the&s;e experiments were performed, were of the &s;ame temperament, and occa&s;ionally practi&s;ed the chewing of to|bacco. From the twentieth experiment, which was per|formed by Mr. Lee, we &s;ee clearly manife&s;ted the immen&s;e power of the re&s;inous portion of the extract, and its virtue as a medicine, occa&s;ioning nau&s;ea, a profu&s;e per&s;piration, and at length vomiting.</P>
<P>Tobacco appears to be unequivocally a powerful dia|phoretic, and as &s;uch it has proved efficacious in a variety of di&s;ea&s;es. It is to be regretted that its exhibition is not oftener repeated; for there are te&s;timonies of its &s;alutary in|fluence in many ob&s;tinate fevers, which predominated over the mo&s;t powerful remedies which are e&s;teemed valuable for exciting a &s;peedy and profu&s;e per&s;piration.</P>
<P>The twenty-fir&s;t and twenty &s;econd experiments, vince the immen&s;e power which the di&s;tilled water po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es: phy&s;icians formerly made u&s;e of it with advantage, and I entertain not the &s;malle&s;t doubt, but that, with a proper dilution, it may now be admini&s;tered with much efficacy.</P>
<P>The twenty-third, twenty-fourth, and twenty-fifth ex|periments, clearly demon&s;trate the emetic and purgative qualities of this plant; and the twenty-&s;ixth, twenty-&s;e|venth, and twenty-eighth, again elucidate the difference ex|i&s;ting between the gum and re&s;in; for, agreeable to the&s;e ex|periments, we find that one half of the latter, operated more powerfully than twice the quantity of the former.</P>
<P>The immen&s;e acrimony of the di&s;tilled water, is evi|dently

depicked in the twenty-ninth experiment, for the &s;mall quantity of thirty drops produced convul&s;ions and death in a cat, in the &s;hort &s;pace of twelve minutes. The thirtieth, and the &s;ucceeding experiments &s;ufficiently evince the power with which the oil of tobacco is endued, occa|&s;ioning a univer&s;al tremor throughout the whole frame, and a paraly&s;is of the parts to which it was applied.</P>

<HEAD>An account of its medical virtues, in eradicating certain di&s;ea&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THE medical powers of tobacco were generally known among phy&s;icians, at an early period, who a&s;cribed many virtues to it in certain ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;es. With re&s;pect to its operation as a general evacuant, I may, from my expe|riments, and the corroborating a&s;&s;ertions of various authors, pronounce this medicine a valuable acqui&s;ition to the mate|ria medica; and that its evident operation on the &s;y&s;tem, is that of <HI>a &s;udorific</HI> an <HI>emetic,</HI> a <HI>cathartic</HI> and a <HI>diuretic.</HI> Hence the propriety of its u&s;e, in a variety of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es of a&s;cites and other drop&s;ical affections, it ap|pears to be an invaluable remedy.</P>
<P>As a diuretic, I would venture to a&s;&s;ert, that it is ex|celled by few, if any of our indigenous plants. The <HI>digi|talis purpurea,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purple Fox-glove.</NOTE> which grows luxuriantly in South-Caroli|na,
<PB N="59" REF="035230_0058_10053E1F8544B970">
has been much celebrated for its diuretic quality, by medical characters; but I have &s;een in&s;tances where the to|bacco has eradicated &s;everal violent ca&s;es of <HI>a&s;cites,</HI> where this had proved but of little effect. "Diuretics," &s;ays a much celebrated character,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See profe&s;&s;or Barton's e&s;&s;ay towards a <HI>materia medica</HI> of the United States. page 34.</NOTE> "have &s;o long been employed with benefit in the treatment of drop&s;ies, that it becomes a matter of con&s;equence, to increa&s;e the number of the medi|cines of this cla&s;s, and to learn how to exhibit, with more advantage, tho&s;e which are already known." In how great e&s;timation then &s;hould we hold that plant, which is evident|ly endowed with a power of evacuating the accumulated water by a natural di&s;charge, for the relief of a&s;cites and other drop&s;ical affections, in lieu of re&s;orting to a &s;urgical operation, which is painful and di&s;agreeable to the afflicted patient; that nicotiana po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this quality no one will pretend to deny.</P>
<P>Every practitioner of medicine, who has attentively peru&s;ed the publication of the ingenious Doctor Fowler, on the effects of Tobacco, with re&s;pect to its diuretic quality, mu&s;t candidly acknowledge its &s;alutary effects, in ca&s;es of drop&s;y and dy&s;ury. The uniform re&s;ult atten|dant on his experiments, together with the many proofs of its virtues which have come under my cognizance, clearly evince the indefinite worth of this plant, and the nece&s;&s;ity of admini&s;tering it in tho&s;e ca&s;es of drop&s;y, which &s;eem to triumph over medicines of le&s;s efficacy, although held in the greate&s;t repute.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this &s;till further, I have been informed by &s;everal per&s;ons of unque&s;tionable veracity, that a variety
<PB N="60" REF="035230_0059_10053E22C696FB30">
of the mo&s;t violent ca&s;es of drop&s;y, many of which had baffled the &s;kill of the mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians, were per|fectly eradicated by an old negro fellow. His remedy was, for a time, unknown to any but him&s;elf, until, by &s;ome accidental occurrence, it was di&s;covered to be a &s;imple decoction of tobacco, di&s;gui&s;ed with &s;ome odoriferous herb. As an additional proof of the efficacy of this plant in the various &s;pecies of drop&s;y, I &s;hall take the liberty of introducing the opinion of Dr. Cullen, when con&s;idering the effects or vomiting, in promoting ab&s;orption, and there|by relieving patients affected with drop&s;y. "Spontaneous vomiting," &s;ays the Dr. has &s;ometimes excited an ab&s;orption in hydropic parts, and thereby drawn off the waters lodged in them, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that vomiting excited by art, may have the &s;ame effect; and accordingly it has been often practi&s;ed with advantage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cullen's Fir&s;t lines Vol. II. page 407.</NOTE>." The doctor then proceeds with ob&s;erving, "that there are no means we can employ to procure a copious evacuation of &s;erous fluids, with greater certainty than the operation of purgatives, and it is upon the&s;e accounts, that purging is the evacua|tion which has been mo&s;t frequently, and perhaps with mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, employed in drop&s;y<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cullen's Practice of Phy&s;ic. Vol. II. page 408.</NOTE>." He further remarks "that the kidneys afford a natural outlet for a great part of the watery fluids, contained in the blood ve&s;&s;els; and the increa&s;ing the excretions by the kidneys<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is remarked by Dr. Sydenham when treating of diuretics in drop|&s;ical ca&s;es, "that where the waters are not to be di&s;charged by vo|miting or purging; for in&s;tance in weak con&s;titutions, and hy&s;teric &s;ubjects, they cannot be evacuated by <HI>purgatives,</HI> and much le&s;s by <HI>vomitives</HI> but are to be carried off by <HI>diuretics.</HI> Several of this kind are extolled in the writings of phy&s;icians, but the mo&s;t, if not the only efficacious ones, in my opinion, are tho&s;e prepared from <HI>lixivial &s;alts,</HI> from whatever plant the a&s;hes be obtained". Doctor Wallis ob&s;erves that the a&s;hes of tobacco, has oftentimes proved efficacious in the re|lief of drop&s;y. Wallis's Sydenham.

<PB N="61" REF="035230_0060_10053E24607E8AE0">
diuretic medicines have been always properly employed in the cure of drop&s;y. It happens however, unluckily, that none of <HI>them</HI> are of a <HI>very certain operation</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor Fowler ob&s;erves on this head, that &s;uch con&s;iderations fir&s;t induced him to make trial of a greater variety of diuretic medicines in drop&s;ical ca&s;es, than have generally been u&s;ed; in hopes of finding &s;ome one, more efficacious than the re&s;t: and he flatters him&s;elf, he may recommend, as &s;uch, the celebrated India plant commonly called Tobacco.</NOTE>". He then proceeds by announcing the utility of &s;udorifics, in many ca&s;es of drop&s;ical affections, and affirms, that they have proved &s;alutary in many in&s;tances.</P>
<P>As I have had &s;ome opportunities of witne&s;&s;ing the happy effects of tobacco, and its various operations on the &s;y&s;tem, I would beg leave to ob&s;erve that all the&s;e virtues hitherto enumerated by Doctor Cullen, appear to be, under certain circum&s;tances, concentrated in this plant; from my experience, I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, with &s;ome degree of confidence, that it has proved of ine&s;timable worth for the relief of patients afflcted with drop&s;y.</P>
<P>In reviewing what I have written on the medical pro|perties of this plant, I perceive that my limitted information has prevented me from doing ample ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject: in order, therefore, to extenuate my deficiencies, I &s;hall
<PB N="62" REF="035230_0061_10053E2736203F38">
apply to the learned pages of Doctor Fowler<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Doctor Thomas Fowler's Medical reports of the Effects of Tobacco.</NOTE> for aid, in accompli&s;hing the de&s;ign of this undertaking.</P>
<P>In this work &s;o replete with medical information, many intere&s;ting facts may be collected; and I tru&s;t that it will be found on an impa&s;&s;ioned examination of our experiments, that I have not departed from truth, nor built my opinions on conjecture.</P>
<P>Doctor Fowler ob&s;erves that a paragraph, in the third volume of Dr. Duncan's very valuable medical commen|taries, fir&s;t induced him to admini&s;ter tobacco. It was part of a letter, from Dr. Garden of Charle&s;ton South-Carolina, to Dr. Hope of Edinburgh; wherein he &s;ays&mdash;"Here we u&s;e with &s;urprizingly great efficacy, in drop&s;ical ca&s;es, the alkaline fixed &s;alt of tobacco, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Doctor Fowler remarks that a variety of operations, in different authors, have been a&s;cribed to this plant, and that he was led from this circum&s;tance to a&s;certain more particularly its virtues; being &s;olicitous of e&s;tabli&s;hing his opinions on a more &s;ub&s;tantial ba&s;is than the a&s;&s;ertions of others, he re&s;olved on entering into a minute inve&s;tigation of the &s;ubject, and con&s;equently founded the po&s;itions there &s;tated, on his own experience and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of this enquiry, has afforded him very fa|vourable ideas upon the &s;ubject, and from the number of facts enumerated by him, we may infer, that tobacco, under proper regulations, may be admini&s;tered internally, not only as a &s;afe, but as an efficacious, and valuable remedy; e&s;peci|ally
<PB N="63" REF="035230_0062_10053E28B78F1560">
as a <HI>powerful diuretic</HI> in ca&s;es of drop&s;ies and dy&s;uries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To illu&s;trate the manner of its exhibition, and al&s;o its &s;alu|ary effects in many ca&s;es, I will take the liberty of in&s;erting a few extracts from Dr. Fowler, as related by him, and which were the re|&s;ults of his own ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>It appears from many experiments, &s;ays the Doctor, that the average do&s;e for an adult &s;ufficient to produce the de&s;ired effect, will be about eighty drops of the infu&s;ion; or to &s;peak with &s;ome latitude, from &s;ixty drops to one hundred, and to be repeated twice a day.</P>
<P>The propere&s;t times for admini&s;tering the medicine, are two hours before dinner, and at bed-time; it being ob&s;erved to di&s;agree the mo&s;t with the &s;tomach, in a morning fa&s;ting. And &s;uch is the difference between morning and night, that almo&s;t every patient will require to take one fourth, and &s;ome even one third le&s;s, in the forenoon, than in the evening; in order to enable them to bear the do&s;es, with equal convenience. The infu&s;ion &s;hould always be ad|mini&s;tered in &s;ome vehicle; which may either be water, or any other &s;imple drink.</P>
<P>The common do&s;e ju&s;t mentioned, relate only to adults of an ordinary con&s;titution; for it de&s;erves particular notice, that be|tween con&s;titutions, which are very nervous and irritable, and tho&s;e which are very robu&s;t, or torpid, or long accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of tobacco, the do&s;es will admit of very great, and &s;urpri&s;ing varia|tions.</P>
<P>As an illu&s;tration of this point, I &s;hall here annex a comparative view of the do&s;es of the infu&s;ion, admini&s;tered in ninety four ca&s;es of adults; taking the medium-do&s;e of each ca&s;e, and reducing the whole into four cla&s;&s;es, according to the number of drops.</P>

<P>Seeing the diver&s;ity of do&s;es is &s;o great, I would lay it down as a rule, by way of caution, to begin with &s;ixty drops, or three fourths of the medium-do&s;e, in a ca&s;e of a delicate con&s;titution; and to in|crea&s;e the number of drops, by five, eight or ten at a time, till by their obvious effects on the &s;y&s;tem, the proper do&s;e &s;hall be a&s;cer|tained.</P>
<P>But if the patient &s;hould be a male, and the con&s;titution robu&s;t, torpid, or accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of tobacco, we may &s;afely venture to begin with eighty, ninety, or one hundred drops; and thus, with more expedition, regulate the future do&s;es according to the effects</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE decoction of tobacco, exhibited in the form of an injection, has afforded almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous relief, after other medicines had proved ineffectual. Particularly as Dr. Sydenham ob&s;erves, "when the violence of the vomit|ing do not yield to mild purgatives; for it avails not to ex|hibit a gentle cathartic, unle&s;s perhaps, the patient be ea&s;y to work upon, which &s;hould be carefully inquired into, be|cau&s;e &s;uch a medicine, being too weak to make its way through the inte&s;tinal tube, does more mi&s;chief: the vo|miting and pain being increa&s;ed by its languid and ineffec|tual motion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wallis's Sydenham, p. 277.</NOTE>" There was a violent ca&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, which came under the immediate in&s;pection of Dr. Deas, in South-Carolina; where the beneficial influence of to|bacco was very demon&s;trative. Several powerful cathar|tics were admini&s;tered without the &s;malle&s;t effect; and the di&s;order was degenerating fa&s;t into an iliac pa&s;&s;ion. Re|cour&s;e was then had, as the la&s;t re&s;ource, to a &s;trong de|coction of the dried leaves of tobacco; immediately after the exhibition of it, through the medium of the rectum, a violent commotion pervaded the whole abdominal vi&s;cera; the patient became extremely re&s;tle&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Fowler remarks, that by a proper admini&s;tration, the&s;e violent effects may be avoided. An ounce of the infu&s;ion he ob|&s;erves, will be found a medium do&s;e, in the form of an injection, for an adult of an ordinary con&s;titution; and the general rule by which he was guided, is as follows: Suppo&s;ing a common injection to have been admini&s;tered without effect, I would order one of an ounce of the infu&s;ion, agreeable to the preceding ob&s;ervation, in half a pint of milk, or common gruel, to be immediately injected. If this procured no relief, or excited no giddine&s;s, or nau&s;ea, con|tinuing for the &s;pace of thirty, forty, or &s;ixty minutes; the&s;e la&s;t effects in ob&s;tinate con&s;tipations, mo&s;t frequently preceding its lax|ative operation, then I would gradually increa&s;e the &s;trength of the future injections, till one or other of the&s;e effects &s;hould take place.</P>
<P>By this mode of proceeding, the powers of the medicines, whe|ther &s;ucce&s;sful or not, will be fully tried in the &s;pace of a few hours; a matter of &s;erious con&s;equence, where &s;u&s;pen&s;e is di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and delay dangerous.</P></NOTE>, and it was with
