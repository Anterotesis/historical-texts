<Q><BIBL>1 PETER, v.3.</BIBL>
<P>NEITHER AS BEING LORDS OVER GOD's HERITAGE, BUT BEING ENSAMPLES TO THE FLOCK.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN every nation of the world there is &s;ome notion of a &s;upreme being, and &s;ome kind of influence which this notion has on the minds of men, di&s;|po&s;ing them to fear, hope, confidence, and other affec|tions which bear the name of religion. It has al&s;o been u&s;ual, from the earlie&s;t ages, for &s;ome per&s;ons to be peculiarly devoted to the offices of religion, who have been &s;uppo&s;ed to have a more intimate know|lege of the object of wor&s;hip, than the body of the people, and in con&s;equence thereof to be more ca|pable of directing, in&s;tructing, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in things of a religious nature. In &s;ome countries the &s;y&s;tem of religion has been intimately blended with the civil con&s;titution and military e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;o that no affairs of government, or of war could be undertak|en but by the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the prie&s;thood. In others, their mini&s;try has been chiefly directed to
<PB N="6" REF="021673_0005_0FB505F60503E7B0">
the inculcating principles and opinions relating to the invi&s;ible world, compo&s;ing literary works, reciting hi&s;|torical facts, and pre&s;erving them for the information of po&s;terity, performing devotional ceremonies, edu|cating children, &s;tudying the nature of di&s;ea&s;es and medicines, attending the &s;ick, and performing the rites of &s;epulture.</P>
<P>IT is not &s;trange, that when per&s;ons of &s;agacity and experience are profe&s;&s;ionally devoted to &s;uch offices, they &s;hould thereby gain an influence over the minds of men, and induce them to repo&s;e great confidence in them, as per&s;ons &s;tanding in a near relation to invi&s;ible, &s;uperior beings. Where ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition hold their gloomy reign, it is not unu&s;ual for this order of men to be regarded as the di&s;pen&s;ers of ble&s;&s;ings and cur&s;es, holding the fates of individuals and of nations in their hands; nor is it uncommon for them to be in|toxicated with the idea of their importance, and to abu&s;e the power which they have gained over their fellow-mortals, to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of ambition, avarice and &s;en&s;uality. But as vapours in the atmo&s;phere, when they have ri&s;en to a certain height, are unable to &s;u&s;|tain them&s;elves in the &s;uperior regions; &s;o it often happens that exorbitant power falls by its own weight. When the claims of &s;piritual u&s;urpers are examined by the calm light of rea&s;on, or thwarted by the inter|e&s;ts of the rich and powerful, they are not able to &s;up|port their extravagance, but are obliged to &s;ubmit and be curtailed. Nor is it unu&s;ual for the world to pa&s;s from one extreme to the other; and from reverencing the prie&s;thood as the repre&s;entatives of divinity, to re|proach them as infernal emi&s;&s;aries, employed in &s;ub|verting
<PB N="7" REF="021673_0006_0FB505F9030C3E30">
the rights of men, and mi&s;leading them to &s;erve the mo&s;t wicked purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>EXAMPLES to elucidate the&s;e ob&s;ervations may be brought from the hi&s;tories of all nations, heathen as well as chri&s;tian, and of all times, ancient as well as modern. The pre&s;ent age does not want authors who are as lavi&s;h of their invectives again&s;t the clergy, as any of the clergy them&s;elves were of their own prai&s;es in the height of their u&s;urpations. True rea&s;on and genuine philo&s;ophy will always di&s;regard indi&s;crim|inate cen&s;ure on whole bodies and profe&s;&s;ions of men; but the enemies of religion very &s;eldom exerci&s;e that true rea&s;on or genuine philo&s;ophy of which candor is an e&s;&s;ential attribute. Too indolent to examine, too corrupt to lie open to conviction, they imbibe preju|dices and repeat invectives of which they ought to be a&s;hamed. But, while &s;uch invectives have an influ|ence on the vacant and unguarded mind, there is no &s;mall danger, that a &s;pecies of vulgar infidelity, which has its foundation in debauchery and ill manners, may weaken the bonds of &s;ociety, and introduce a laxity in morals, which even the religion of nature, as it is now under&s;tood, would utterly condemn.</P>
<P>IF the exi&s;tence of a Deity, the obligations of mo|rality, and the &s;anction of future rewards and puni&s;h|ments, be allowed to have an influence on the hap|pine&s;s of &s;ociety, there mu&s;t be an advantage ari&s;ing from the public teaching of the&s;e principles, by an order of men de&s;tined to this &s;ervice, who are inter|e&s;ted in the truths which they deliver, the precepts which they inculcate, the motives which they exhibit,
<PB N="8" REF="021673_0007_0FB505FB41EF9B00">
and the pro&s;pects which they open to view, equally with tho&s;e who hear them. Every friend to the pub|lic or private happine&s;s of mankind mu&s;t allow, that per&s;ons who are employed in &s;uch a beneficial office, who decently perform their duty, and endeavour to honour their profe&s;&s;ion by exemplifying the virtues which they recommend, are entitled to as much re&s;pect as tho&s;e who prudently conduct the affairs of govern|ment and admini&s;ter public ju&s;tice; e&s;pecially, when neither the one, nor the other, are impo&s;ed on the people, but are freely elected to their offices, by a known and regular con&s;titution; and are equally amenable to their con&s;tituents for any mi&s;behaviour in their re&s;pective offices.</P>
<P>THAT &s;uch men have an a&s;cendency over the peo|ple with whom they are connected, is a fact demon|&s;trated by experience and founded in the principles of human nature. This was well known to the wi&s;e and benevolent Author of Chri&s;tianity; and therefore, in the precepts which he has given for the conduct of his mini&s;ters, he has provided how this influence &s;hould be maintained, what purpo&s;e it &s;hould be directed to &s;erve, and how the abu&s;e of it &s;hould be prevented. As his mini&s;ters have no &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns in view, nor any &s;ecret arts by which their conduct is governed; &s;o the commands which are given for their direction are equally open to the in&s;pection of all to whom they mini&s;ter: who may learn from thence how far it is &s;afe to let their teachers gain an a&s;cendency over them, and how to guard again&s;t the abu&s;e of it. Our text contains a remarkable precept of this kind: it has a negative and a po&s;itive part; the former is intended to
<PB N="9" REF="021673_0008_0FB505FECBC3FE50">
guard again&s;t u&s;urpation; the latter, to direct the mi|ni&s;terial influence into its right channel.
<Q>Neither as being lords over God's heritage; but being en|&s;amples to the flock.</Q></P>
<P N="1">I. THE negative part of this exhortation, like many other precepts of the go&s;pel, &s;eems to have been dictated, not only by a benevolent regard to the be&s;t intere&s;t of mankind, but by the &s;pirit of prophecy; which fore&s;aw the apo&s;tacy of &s;ucceeding times, and gave the church a precious antidote, to be u&s;ed either by way of prevention or remedy. The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a caution is fully evident from the numberle&s;s in|&s;tances of u&s;urpation and dominion with which eccle|&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory abounds, as well as from the nature of power, which always needs a check. The utility of the precept is evident from the benefit which the church has received by an attention to it. It is direct|ed to mini&s;ters, to keep down the &s;pirit of domination in them; and it is open to the in&s;pection of the whole church of God, that they may u&s;e proper means to check the workings of &s;uch a &s;pirit as &s;oon as it makes it&s;elf vi&s;ible. The church is here called, God's heri|tage, in allu&s;ion to the ancient church of I&s;rael, which is &s;poken of as the Lord's inheritance. The de&s;ign of the phra&s;e is to &s;hew the property which God has in his people, and his &s;ole right of dominion over them in &s;piritual things. In this view, the language is very proper, becau&s;e the divine right of government&punc; over them being acknowledged, all influence or authority derived from that &s;ource mu&s;t be &s;ubordinate to it, and directed to the &s;ame end; con&s;equently, all other dominion mu&s;t be con&s;idered as u&s;urpation and abu&s;e.
<PB N="10" REF="021673_0009_0FB50601E5B85B58">
That influence or authority which a&s;&s;umes to be de|rived from God, for the benefit of his church, mu&s;t bear the marks of its heavenly origin. If it does not in &s;ome good mea&s;ure re&s;emble God him&s;elf, it can|not be from him, and con&s;equently is not to be &s;ub|mitted to by his people.</P>
<P>I SHALL not take up your time with reciting the opi|nions of criticks and commentators on the terms u&s;ed in the text. The que&s;tion among them &s;eems to have been, whether the lord&s;hip, here forbidden, be tem|poral power, in di&s;tinction from &s;piritual; or arbitra|ry and oppre&s;&s;ive power, in di&s;tinction from limited and gentle. Tho&s;e who are advocates for blending temporal and &s;piritual power in the clergy (or rather in the higher orders of them) &s;eem to have forgotten what our Lord &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, when they had imagined he was about &s;etting up a temporal king|dom, and were contending which of them &s;hould be the greate&s;t in it;
<Q>The princes of the Gentiles exer|ci&s;e dominion over them, and they that are great exerci&s;e authority upon them; but it &s;hall not be &s;o among you.</Q>
This prohibition affords a &s;ufficient comment on what the apo&s;tle &s;ays in the text. Peter had learned of his Lord not to a&s;pire to temporal do|minion, or to exerci&s;e authority over the lives, and e&s;tates, and worldly concerns of the people who com|po&s;e the church of God. Though once infected with this error, he had been cured of it, and was de&s;irous of guarding all &s;ucceeding mini&s;ters again&s;t it. The care of the&s;e things mu&s;t be left to civil magi&s;trates, who&s;e office it is to bear rule in temporal concerns; the bu&s;ine&s;s of eccle&s;ia&s;tical officers is confined to things
<PB N="11" REF="021673_0010_0FB5060386DDFEE0">
of a &s;piritual nature; and even here, they have no right to pre&s;cribe or define articles of faith, and modes of di&s;cipline; nor to in&s;i&s;t on a &s;trict conformity in the people to their &s;entiments; nor to cen&s;ure and ex|communicate others for differing in opinion from them; but they are to let every one &s;earch the &s;crip|ture for him&s;elf, and form his own judgment concern|ing what is truth; and they are to &s;eek for peace and edification in the exerci&s;e of mutual forbearance and charity, rather than in uniformity. However plau&s;ible &s;uch a thing may be in theory, experience has decided again&s;t it; and it is hoped that the chri&s;tian world will &s;o profit by their knowledge as never to repeat the experiment.</P>
<P>BUT, not to enlarge on this head; the negative command in the text may fairly be under&s;tood to di&s;|countenance, not only the a&s;&s;umption of civil and tem|poral authority in the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel; but all har&s;hne&s;s and &s;everity, "a lofty look and a proud heart," an overbearing, dogmati&s;ing temper, and a want of conde&s;cention to human weakne&s;s.
<Q>The &s;ervant of the Lord mu&s;t not &s;trive, but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient; in meekne&s;s in&s;tructing tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them&s;elves, if peradventure God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.</Q></P>
<P N="2">II. LET us now con&s;ider the &s;econd part of the text, which is a po&s;itive direction for the conduct of Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters, "but as en&s;amples to the flock." The an|tithe&s;is here is very &s;triking, and affords us an impor|tant remark. Not as lords; but as examples. Then, if we a&s;&s;ume power which does not belong to us, we
<PB N="12" REF="021673_0011_0FB5060702B42380">
are not examples. If we are lofty, arrogant, ambi|tious, di&s;dainful, and overbearing, we are not exam|ples to the flock. Were the flock to follow &s;uch ex|amples, they would re&s;emble bea&s;ts of prey rather than &s;heep. In&s;tead of mutual love, they would prac|ti&s;e envy, hatred, &s;trife and every evil work. When our Lord Je&s;us &s;aid that he had given us an example, he was in circum&s;tances of great humility, wa&s;hing his di&s;ciples' feet; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xii.15.</NOTE> and when he cautioned them again&s;t exerci&s;ing dominion, he put them in mind of his own example,
<Q>even as the Son of Man came not to be mini&s;tred unto, but to mini&s;ter.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xx.28.</NOTE></P>
<P>BLUSH at this, ye a&s;piring pontiffs, and imitators of a&s;piring pontiffs! ye, who affect to carry your heads above your brethren, and pretend to be more digni|fied and more holy than they! your &s;acerdotal claims have been examined, and TEKEL is written upon them. Would you enjoy a real dignity? de&s;cend to your pro|per level; imitate your Ma&s;ter; be the &s;ervants of his people; and wait for your exaltation, till you re|ceive the EUGE from his lips.</P>
<P>IT is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the language of our text is an allu&s;ion to the cu&s;tom of &s;hepherds in the oriental countries, who train their flocks to the practice of following them, and thus lead them where|ever they would have them to go. They know the voice of their &s;hepherd, they tread in his &s;teps, and they fear no danger in following him. What a lively emblem of the power of good example! The Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are beings of the &s;ame rank with the People committed to their charge: they have the &s;ame inter|e&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="021673_0012_0FB5060968417B20">
to &s;erve: they cannot mi&s;lead them without injur|ing them&s;elves; and they cannot honour them&s;elves or benefit their people more, than by going before them in a &s;teady uniform practice of the various duties which they recommend by their preaching.</P>
<P>MUCH judgment is nece&s;&s;ary to conduct that part of the mini&s;terial bu&s;ine&s;s which re&s;pects public in|&s;truction; much &s;tudy and prayer mu&s;t be u&s;ed to di&s;cover and to deliver divine truth, &s;o as to enlighten the under&s;tandings of the hearers, and impre&s;s them with an idea of its importance. As this divine truth equally concerns tho&s;e who preach as tho&s;e who hear, it is natural to enquire how far the preachers them&s;elves are affected by it. It gives plea&s;ure to an attentive audience to ob&s;erve that the &s;peaker is affected with the delivery of go&s;pel truths; but neither the judici|ous preaching of them, nor the appearance of being affected by them in public, will give complete &s;atisfac|tion to per&s;ons of di&s;cernment. There mu&s;t be evi|dence ari&s;ing from the practical influence which the&s;e truths have on their life and conduct.</P>
<P>THIS is the appointed way of judging concerning our &s;incerity; "by their fruits ye &s;hall know them;" this is the way of judging in other ca&s;es, and it is the only &s;olid foundation on which a &s;atisfactory judgment can be formed. When a per&s;on prepares for public exhibition, whether in the pulpit, at the bar, or on the &s;tage, he will endeavour to make his performance agreeable, &s;o as, at lea&s;t, to &s;upport his reputation; but no one can judge of his &s;incerity merely from this circum&s;tance; neither can &s;uch a conclu&s;ion be drawn
<PB N="14" REF="021673_0013_0FB5060AB83BB0E0">
from the appearance of being deeply affected in the public delivery; but there is in the life and behavi|our, a &s;ilent, &s;teady evidence, which is credible, becau&s;e unaffected. This evidence is the re&s;ult of principle and of habit: it is founded on a deep conviction of the nature and importance of go&s;pel truth; of its impor|tance, not only to mankind in general, but to our&s;elves in particular. The go&s;pel mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure have its genuine influence on our own hearts, before we can, with any propriety or con&s;i&s;tency, recommend it to others; and when we have begun to feel this happy influence, and to declare to others what we our&s;elves know to be true, the pur&s;uit of tho&s;e &s;acred &s;tudies will be a noble advantage to us, not only in acquiring and methodi&s;ing our &s;peculative &s;entiments, but in re|&s;training our pa&s;&s;ions, regulating our affections, direct|ing our views, and forming our true characters. We &s;hall not only grow in knowledge, but that knowledge will be reduced to practice; we &s;hall be ca&s;t into the mould of divine truth; our hearts and lives will be fa&s;hioned according to the doctrines which we preach, the duties which we inculcate, the examples which we recommend, and the pro&s;pects which we open from the word of God. Every di&s;cour&s;e, which we prepare for public delivery, will be fir&s;t preached to our&s;elves; we &s;hall feel the force of what we &s;ay; our hearts, like wax under the &s;eal, will receive the impre&s;&s;ion, and our lives will &s;hew to the world that the go&s;pel which we preach has its proper effect on our&s;elves.</P>
<P>GOD, in the cour&s;e of his providence, will train us up for farther u&s;efulne&s;s in his church, by placing us in circum&s;tances &s;imilar to the re&s;t of mankind, and
<PB N="15" REF="021673_0014_0FB5060E6FD80C00">
putting us into trials which will give occa&s;ion for the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame virtues which we recommend to others. As we are men of like pa&s;&s;ions with them, &s;o our temptations and our afflictions are of the &s;ame kind; we experience the plea&s;ures and the pains ari&s;ing from pro&s;perous and adver&s;e circum&s;tances in life: our &s;o|cial connections afford various opportunities for prac|ti&s;ing the &s;ocial duties; and our knowledge, acquired by experience, corre&s;ponding with what we gain by &s;tudy, will accompli&s;h us for eminent &s;ervice in our mini&s;terial character. It is in trials that virtue &s;hines; and when Providence affords us the&s;e trials, then our example &s;hould be &s;uch as may in&s;truct and edify our people. Then we preach with a &s;ilent, yet per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence; and &s;uch practical, exemplary preaching will leave a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the ob|&s;ervers.</P>
<P>IT may perhaps be here objected, that if the exem|plary life of a mini&s;ter be of &s;uch importance, we ought to be well a&s;&s;ured of his being really a good man, be|fore we can receive any benefit from his preaching. Nay, &s;ome may carry the matter &s;o far as to doubt the validity of ordinances admini&s;tered by one who is im|moral. In an&s;wer to this, I beg you to recollect the words of the We&s;tmin&s;ter A&s;&s;embly, in their an&s;wer to the que&s;tion,
<Q>How do the &s;acraments become effectual means of &s;alvation? Not from any virtue in them, or in him that doth admini&s;ter them, but only by the ble&s;&s;ing of Chri&s;t, and the working of his &s;pirit in tho&s;e who receive them by faith.</Q>
Mini&s;ters, even of the be&s;t characters, are but in&s;truments of di&s;pen&s;ing the word and ordinances; they are but earthen ve&s;&s;els,
<PB N="16" REF="021673_0015_0FB5061380038A40">
in which the trea&s;ure is contained; and though their good example may add a lu&s;tre to what they preach, yet their bad example can by no means prevent the efficacy of the word and ordinances to the proper &s;ub|jects of them, becau&s;e this efficacy depends on other cau&s;es. Man, whether good or bad, can &s;peak only to the outward ear, God mu&s;t &s;peak to the heart. Paul may plant and Apollos water; but God giveth the increa&s;e. The apo&s;tles were &s;ent to preach the go&s;pel, and no exception was made of Judas; though his Lord knew him to have a wicked heart. A divine power might, and probably did accompany his preach|ing, as well as that of the others, for their report, when they returned, was,
<Q>Lord, even the devils are &s;ubject to us through thy name.</Q>
Judas, though a deceit|ful per&s;on and a fal&s;e profe&s;&s;or, yet is not charged with corrupting the word or in&s;titutions of Chri&s;t. He was &s;ent out, with the others, to preach, to baptize, and to work miracles. If Chri&s;t had deemed his mini&s;tra|tions invalid, becau&s;e of the badne&s;s of his heart, he would not have &s;ent him; and this may be a&s;&s;igned as one rea&s;on why our Lord employed &s;uch a per&s;on as Judas in the mini&s;terial work, to make his people ea&s;y with re&s;pect to the efficacy of the word and ordi|nances, though admini&s;tered by a per&s;on who&s;e heart may not be right with God. The con&s;equence will indeed be dreadful to the per&s;on him&s;elf, who under|takes the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try from no better motives than Judas did; but his hypocri&s;y cannot hinder the word and ordinances from being effectual to others, if their hearts be properly di&s;po&s;ed to receive &s;piritual benefit from them.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="021673_0016_0FB50615E06FFC50">IT will not follow from hence, that any per&s;on, knowing him&s;elf to be immoral, may warrantably un|dertake the work of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter; nor that any church may call &s;uch an one to office, nor continue him in it, after his immorality is manife&s;t, if there be no &s;igns of repentance. Great charity, however, is to be u&s;ed in forming our opinion of the moral characters of mini&s;ters, as well as of other people. No man can be too &s;evere in examining him&s;elf, nor too candid in judging another. Su&s;picions and un&s;upported a&s;&s;er|tions mu&s;t have no weight: rea&s;onable evidence mu&s;t be admitted; but candor ought, at the &s;ame time, to be exerci&s;ed; and when the fruits of repentance ap|pear, charity will admit them as credible, and the of|fender will be
<Q>re&s;tored in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, con|&s;idering our&s;elves le&s;t we al&s;o be tempted.</Q></P>
<P>THE conclu&s;ion from the&s;e remarks is, that though the real goodne&s;s of a mini&s;ter's heart be not e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the validity of his admini&s;trations; yet his good example is of &s;o much importance to the &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel which he preaches, that he ought to at|tend with the utmo&s;t caution to the pre&s;ervation of his character. His duty is to watch over his heart and life, to &s;ubdue his appetites and pa&s;&s;ions,
<Q>to keep un|der his body, and bring it into &s;ubjection, le&s;t, when he has preached to others, (and perhaps done &s;ome good to them) he him&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t-away.</Q>
His good example &s;hould be uniform and unvaried: He &s;hould never lay a&s;ide his mini&s;terial character in any company, nor on any occa&s;ion.
<Q>Remember, my friend, (&s;aid the good Mr. Hervey, in a letter to a young mini&s;ter) remember, when you are in company,

<P>WILL my honoured Fathers and beloved Brethren in the go&s;pel mini&s;try indulge me in addre&s;&s;ing a few words to them on this occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>YOU are, doubtle&s;s, fully &s;en&s;ible of the va&s;t impor|tance of the duty which has now been recommended, and the many weighty con&s;iderations by which an at|tention to it may be enforced. Our &s;ituation in life is &s;ingular; mankind are continually ob&s;erving us; &s;ome with an eye of candor and re&s;pect; others of jealou&s;y and envy. Some are looking to us as examples for them&s;elves to walk by; they are plea&s;ed and edified when they &s;ee us conform to the pattern of our Ma&s;ter; and they are grieved and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed when we do other|wi&s;e. There are others who envy us the influence which we have in &s;ociety; who are jealous that we are aiming at more power than we have a right to; who love to magnify our imperfections, and rejoice when
<PB N="19" REF="021673_0018_0FB5061B86A6DD98" MS="y">
we fall. It becomes us, therefore, to be very circum|&s;pect in our conver&s;ation and behaviour. We are di|rected to
<Q>give no offence in any thing, that the min|i&s;try be not blamed.</Q>
The faults of a few often &s;erve as the foundation of reproach on the whole order; and we are all &s;uppo&s;ed to be equally guilty, though &s;ome have more art to conceal it than oth|ers. We live in the mid&s;t of a &s;coffing world; but, thanks be to God, we have always found, and &s;hall always find fellow-helpers to the truth, to keep us in countenance, and &s;peak comfortably to us. If, therefore, we have di&s;couragement on one hand, we have encouragement on the other. This has been the ca&s;e with the mini&s;ters of God in all ages. This was the ca&s;e with Chri&s;t him&s;elf, and the &s;ervant mu&s;t not think it &s;trange to be "as his ma&s;ter." To plea&s;e the humours of all men is impo&s;&s;ible, and to attempt it would be beneath the dignity of our character. Our bu&s;ine&s;s is to preach the truth, and to practi&s;e what we preach; to be examples to the flock
<Q>in word, in conver&s;ation, in &s;pirit, in faith, in purity.</Q>
Let us then be careful and guarded in all our conduct, at all times, in all places, in all companies, in private and in public. Let our behaviour be a &s;tanding confutation of the cavils of infidels <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"To a philo&s;ophic eye (&s;ays the celebrated GIBBON) the vices of the clergy are far le&s;s dangerous than their virtues."&mdash;A &s;entiment wholly unphilo&s;ophical, becau&s;e wholly void of truth&punc;</NOTE>.

<P>MEN may di&s;cover a degree of weakne&s;s in e&s;timat|ing the goodne&s;s of our doctrine by the exemplarine&s;s
<PB N="20" REF="021673_0019_0FB5061FB3EC30C8">
of our lives; but it is a weakne&s;s of which it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to cure them. Some may be able to rea&s;on &s;o ab|&s;tractedly as to &s;eparate the doctrine of the preacher from the influence it has upon him, and, like the pro|phet Elijah, may be nouri&s;hed by the heavenly food, though brought in a raven's mouth; but the genera|lity of mankind will expect that we live as we preach, and will not profit by our mini&s;try unle&s;s we profit by it our&s;elves. "Phy&s;ician, heal thy&s;elf," is an old and a popular &s;aying, and we mu&s;t conform to it. He who knows our frame, who is perfectly acquainted with our motives, and principles of action, has therefore commanded us to be examples to the flock. Our obedience to this command will prove that we are his true mini&s;ters, worthy to be entru&s;ted with the care of his people. This is the way to maintain that influence over them which will be for their edification; and this is al&s;o the way for us to obtain the joy of pre&s;enting them as a cha&s;te virgin to Chri&s;t, and to have them for the crown of our rejoicing in the day of the Lord.</P>
<P>My dear Brother, who is now about to take the charge of this flock, will permit me, while I con|gratulate him on this joyful occa&s;ion, to put him in mind of his part in the duty which has been recommended.</P>
<P>I DOUBT not, dear Sir, that you know, by your own experience, that the go&s;pel which you preach is the power of God to &s;alvation. I tru&s;t you know &s;ome|thing of its influence on your own &s;oul, and that there is laid in your mind a good foundation for this people to expect, that you will teach them, not only by your
<PB N="21" REF="021673_0020_0FB50621F34E4AE8">
preaching, but by your example, that you will care|fully &s;tudy the &s;acred oracles, to &s;ee what you are to preach, and how you are to practi&s;e; &s;o that you may, not only in the pulpit, but at home and abroad, on all days, and in all circum&s;tances, be teaching them how they &s;hould walk &s;o as to plea&s;e God.</P>
<P>WE have no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that you will ever at|tempt to lord it over God's heritage; you will neither dogmati&s;e in your preaching, nor be arbitrary in your conduct. You will preach what you believe to be the truth, and charge your hearers to judge of it by the &s;ame infallible oracles from which you derive your information. You will not puzzle them with meta|phy&s;ical &s;ubtleties, but will aim to feed them with the &s;incere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby. To in&s;i&s;t much on controverted points, may &s;erve to feed a party-&s;pirit; but is not good for the u&s;e of edi|fying. That preaching is generally the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s|ful, which is the mo&s;t &s;earching, the mo&s;t &s;piritual, the mo&s;t practical. We &s;hould aim directly at the heart; and endeavour to make men feel their concern in what we preach; and the mo&s;t effectual way to do this, is to feel it our&s;elves. The truth, when it comes from the heart, will be likely to reach the heart. Our hearers know that we are made of the &s;ame materials as them&s;elves; and when they &s;ee that we are affected and influenced by what we preach, they will conclude that there is &s;omething in it which ought to affect and influence them. This is an advantage which we have above angels. Were they employed in delivering the &s;ame truths, the church of God could not derive &s;uch a benefit from their mini&s;try; becau&s;e, being of a &s;u|perior
<PB N="22" REF="021673_0021_0FB506236FC270C0">
order in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence, it might be thought that we were exerci&s;ing our&s;elves in things too high for us, if we &s;hould attempt an imitation of them. But it may be rea&s;onably expected that if we practi&s;e what we preach, our hearers will follow our examples, as well as hearken to our in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>IT is plea&s;ing to ob&s;erve the love of this people to you, and their unanimity in their choice of you. Make the be&s;t u&s;e that is po&s;&s;ible of this happy circum&s;tance. An eminent moral writer <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Richard&s;on.</NOTE> has ob&s;erved,

will at the &s;ame time remember that he is but a Man, and therefore liable to err. If you exerci&s;e candor to|ward him, in regard to his infirmities, you may even derive an advantage from them; for you will &s;ee how readily he will attend to your friendly cautions, and &s;et you an example how to correct your own errors. You will have not only his example to influence you, but the &s;ure and infallible word to go to, wherein you will find what his example ought to be. If he con|forms to the dictates of truth, you will have a double &s;atisfaction, fir&s;t in knowing how he ought to walk; and then in ob&s;erving that he walks by the rule; and being fully &s;atisfied on both the&s;e points, you need not fear to let him gain an influence over you and your families, becau&s;e he will u&s;e it only for your edifica|tion. Your confidence will be well placed in him, and you may at all times con&s;ult with him for your &s;piri|tual benefit; you may expect that he will give you the be&s;t advice, and you may be &s;ure of an intere&s;t in his prayers. If you attend to his temporal intere&s;t, and make his life comfortable; if you keep him free from difficulty and embarra&s;&s;ment in worldly matters; he will richly repay your kindne&s;s by attending diligently to your &s;piritual concerns; by providing for your &s;ouls the be&s;t entertainment, by coun&s;elling you in your dif|ficulties, by comforting you in your afflictions, and by &s;etting you a bright example of the virtues and graces of the go&s;pel. May you and your children be happy in your connection with him; and may this connec|tion be founded on &s;uch &s;olid principles, and cement|ed by &s;uch genuine mutual love, as that it may not be di&s;&s;olved through eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="021673_0023_0FB5062AE6AC92E0">LET me now conclude with a word of advice to this whole A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>YOU are all members of particular churches and congregations, &s;ome of which are furni&s;hed with min|i&s;ters, and others perhaps are de&s;titute. Tho&s;e of you who have mini&s;ters to go before you in the practice of religion, &s;hould e&s;teem it as a mo&s;t valuable privilege. Learn to profit by their example, as well as by their preaching. Learn to treat them with kindne&s;s, to form your opinions of them with candor, and if you di&s;cover any error in them, to inform them of it privately, with meekne&s;s and love. Wherein you &s;ee that they follow Chri&s;t, let it be your care to follow them. The go&s;pel which they preach to you, is the rule by which both they and you will be judged at the la&s;t day. This rule is open for your in&s;pection, as well as theirs, and you will be greatly to blame if you neglect to &s;tudy it. Let it be your care to form your hearts and lives by this unerring &s;tandard, that when you and your mini&s;ters &s;hall be called before the bar of Chri&s;t, you may be able to meet them with joy, and that your &s;alvation may increa&s;e their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>DO any of you belong to de&s;titute congregations? you may take a hint, from what you have now heard, to direct you in your choice of a pa&s;tor. The accom|pli&s;hments of a learned education, added to natural abil|ities, are by no means to be neglected; but the good qualities of the heart are the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential; and for this rea&s;on, that a good heart is commonly a pledge of an exemplary life. Speculative opinions are in their nature liable to change. A man may not only very
<PB N="25" REF="021673_0024_0FB5063031B816A0">
innocently, but very con&s;cientiou&s;ly alter his opinions on points of &s;peculation; but if the heart be well e&s;tabli&s;hed in grace and goodne&s;s, it will never alter but by improving it&s;elf under the direction of the di|vine Spirit in the virtues of the go&s;pel; in conformity to the example of Chri&s;t, and in preparation for heaven. Such a mini&s;ter, wherever found, is a great ble&s;&s;ing. God grant that the number of them may be increa&s;ed; that all his flocks may be &s;upplied with pa&s;tors after his own heart, who &s;hall feed them with divine truth, and walk before them in holine&s;s; that we may all dwell in love and peace here, and finally come to that glorious &s;tate where our brighte&s;t hopes &s;hall terminate in complete enjoyment of the promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ings.</P>

The chri&s;tian temper, truly imbibed, con&s;trains mankind to dwell together in unity, like brethren. Under the influence of this temper, private Chri&s;tians feel them&s;elves to be members of one body, and are prompted to a mutual &s;ympathy. Each di&s;tinct church acknowledges its re|lation to its &s;i&s;ter churches, and, in all matters of im|portance, &s;eeks their approbation, advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Their re&s;pective pa&s;tors and teachers, claiming no pre-eminence one above another, and calling no man Ma&s;ter, con&s;ider each other as &s;tanding on the foot of equality in office; and as brethren, bound mutually to love and a&s;&s;i&s;t one another.

In a work &s;o great, difficult and important, he will need the &s;up|port, encouragement, and daily prayers of a kind and grateful people.

And may God Almighty pre|&s;erve his health, prolong his life, and render him a rich and la&s;ting ble&s;&s;ing to you; and finally grant that you may be his joy, and crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord Je&s;us.</P>
