<P>IT may not be ami&s;s to inform the &s;ub&s;cri|bers for the following performance, that a copy was not given at the time it was reque&s;ted, on account of its containing &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages taken from a larger work which the author has by him, unfini&s;hed. Upon farther con&s;ideration however, it is thought not improper to pre&s;ent to the Public a &s;pecimen of that work, in this incorrect manner, that a conjecture may be form|ed what &s;ucce&s;s it may meet, when the whole &s;hall make its appearance. The pa&s;&s;ages are tho&s;e that re&s;pect the affairs of America at large, and the future progre&s;s of Society. As to the other parts of the Poem which are con&s;ined to the &s;tate of education in Connecticut, although the &s;ubject may be thought too particular to be reli&s;hed beyond the limits of a Commencement Auditory, yet if they &s;hould &s;erve to turn the atten|tion of any part of the Public to the real &s;ituation of Yale College, it may ju&s;tify the publication.</P>
