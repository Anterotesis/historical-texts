<HEAD>CHAP. V. REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE.</HEAD>
<P>A NATION is &s;urely in a wretch|ed condition, when the principal object of its government is the increa&s;e of its public revenue. Such a &s;tate of things is in reality a perpetual warfare between the few individuals who govern, and the great body of the people who labour. Or, to call things by their pro|per names, and u&s;e the only language which the moral nature of the ca&s;e will ju&s;tify, the real occupation of the go|vernors is to plunder or to &s;teal, as will be&s;t an&s;wer their purpo&s;e; while the bu&s;ine&s;s of the people is to &s;ecrete their property by fraud, or to give it peaceably up, in proportion as the other party de|mands it; and then, as a con&s;equence of being driven to this nece&s;&s;ity, they &s;lacken their indu&s;try, and become mi|&s;erable through idlene&s;s; in order to avoid the mortification of labouring for tho&s;e they hate.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="026617_0004_0FD0806C4409C870">The art of con&s;tructing governments has u&s;ually been to organize the &s;tate in &s;uch a manner, as that this operation could be carried on to the be&s;t advantage for the admini&s;trators; and the art of admini&s;tring tho&s;e governments has been, &s;o to vary the means of &s;eizing upon pri|vate property, as to bring the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible quantity into the public coffers, without exciting in&s;urrections. Tho&s;e governments which are called de&s;potic, deal more in open plunder; tho&s;e that call them&s;elves free, and act under the cloak of what they teach the people to reverence as a con&s;titution, are driven to the arts of &s;tealing. The&s;e have &s;ucceed|ed better by theft than the others have by plunder; and this is the principal difference by which they can be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed. Under the&s;e <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> go|vernments the people are more indu&s;tri|ous, and create property fa&s;ter; becau&s;e they are not &s;en&s;ible in what manner and in what quantities it is taken from them. The admini&s;tration, in this ca&s;e, operates by a compound movement; one is to induce the people to work, and the other to take from them their earings.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="026617_0005_0FD0806DC20F5FD0">In this view of government, it is no wonder that it &s;hould be con&s;idered as a curious and complicated machine, too my&s;terious for vulgar contemplation, ca|pable of being moved by none but ex|perienced hands, and &s;ubject to fall in pieces by the &s;lighte&s;t attempt at inno|vation or improvement. It is no wonder that a church and an army &s;hould be deemed nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;upport; and that the double guilt of impiety and re|bellion &s;hould follow the man who offers to enter its dark &s;anctuary with the pro|fane light of rea&s;on. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing that kings and prie&s;ts &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to have derived their authority from God, &s;ince it is evidently not given them by men; that they &s;hould trace to a &s;uper|natural &s;ource claims which nature never has recognized, and which are at war with every principle of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I con&s;tantly bear in mind, that there is a re&s;pectable cla&s;s of men in every country in Europe, who, whether im|mediately intere&s;ted in the admini&s;tra|tion of the governments or not, are con|&s;cientiou&s;ly attached to the old e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
<PB N="8" REF="026617_0006_0FD0806F43E0EF68">
forms. I know not how much pain it may give them to &s;ee expo&s;ed to pub|lic view the various combinations of ini|quity which appear to me to compo&s;e the &s;y&s;tem. But I &s;hould pay a real com|pliment to their &s;en&s;ibility, in &s;uppo&s;ing that their angui&s;h can be as great on viewing the picture, as mine has been in attempting to draw it; or, that they can &s;hudder as much at the pro&s;pect of a change, as I have done in contempla|ting &s;ociety under the di&s;tortions of its pre&s;ent organization. I &s;ee the noble nature of man &s;o cruelly deba&s;ed&mdash;I &s;ee the hor&s;e and the dog in &s;o many in&s;tan|ces rai&s;ed to a rank far &s;uperior to beings whom I mu&s;t acknowledge as my fel|low-creatures, and whom my heart can|not but embrace with a fraternal af|fection which mu&s;t increa&s;e with the in|&s;ults I &s;ee them &s;uffer&mdash;I &s;ee the pride of power and of rank mounted to &s;o un|governable a height in tho&s;e whom ac|cident has called to direct the affairs of nations&mdash;I &s;ee the faculty of rea&s;on &s;o completely dormant in both their cla&s;&s;es, and morality, the indi&s;pen&s;able bond of union among men, &s;o effectually bani&s;h|ed

by the unnatural combinations, which in Europe are called Society&mdash;that I have been almo&s;t determined to relinqui&s;h the di&s;agreeable ta&s;k which I had pre|&s;cribed to my&s;elf in the fir&s;t part of this work, and, returning to my country, endeavour in the new world to forget the mi&s;eries of the old.</P>
<P>But I reflect that the contemplation of the&s;e mi&s;eries has already left an im|pre&s;&s;ion on my mind too deep to be ea|&s;ily effaced.&mdash;I am likewi&s;e convinced that all the moral evils under which we labour, may be traced without difficulty to their proper &s;ource&mdash;that the &s;pirit of inve&s;tigation, which the French ravo|lution has awakened in many parts of Europe, is &s;timulating the people to pur|&s;ue the enquiry, and will con&s;equently lead them to apply the remedy. Under this pro&s;pect, every per&s;on who but thinks he can throw the lea&s;t light upon the &s;ubject, is called upon for his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; and this duty to his fellow-crea|ture becomes more imperious, as it is increa&s;ed by the probability of &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="026617_0008_0FD080724887F5C0">In con&s;idering the &s;ubject of <HI>Revenue and Expenditure,</HI> as in other articles that I have treated, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf chiefly to the great outlines of the &s;y&s;|tem; only noticing its effect on the mo|ral habits of men; habits which mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the vital principles of &s;oci|ety, and which ought always to be kept in view as the fir&s;t object of govern|ment, both in its original con&s;titution and in every part of its admini&s;tration. I was indeed &s;en&s;ible that this &s;ubject would require more details; and that it might be u&s;eful to form an e&s;timate of the quantity of contributions nece&s;&s;ary for any given portion of mankind united in a national intere&s;t; as we might thus be convinced how &s;mall a revenue would be &s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es of a ra|tional government. But I find my&s;elf happily relieved from this part of my ta&s;k, by the appearance of the &s;econd part of the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> in which this branch of the &s;ubject is treated in that per&s;picuous manner which might be ex|pected from its author; a man whom I con&s;ider as a luminary of the age, and one of the greate&s;t benefactors of man|kind.

Neither my work, nor any other that &s;hall be written for ages to come, will &s;urely find a reader, who will not have read the <HI>Rights of Man.</HI></P>
<P>Men are gregarious in their nature; they form together in &s;ociety, not mere|ly from nece&s;&s;ity, to avoid the evils of &s;olitude, but from inclination and mu|tual attachment. They find a po&s;itive plea&s;ure in yielding a&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other, in communicating their thoughts and improving their faculties. This di&s;|po&s;ition in man is the &s;ource of morals; they have their foundation in nature, and receive their nouri&s;hment from &s;o|ciety. The different portions of this &s;o|ciety, that call them&s;elves nations, have generally e&s;tabli&s;hed the principle of &s;e|curing to the individuals who compo&s;e a nation, the exclu&s;ive enjoyment of the fruits of their own labour; re&s;erving however to the governing power the right to reclaim from time to time &s;o much of the property and labour of in|dividuals as &s;hall be deemed nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;ervice. This is the ge|neral ba&s;is on which <HI>property,</HI> public and
<PB N="12" REF="026617_0010_0FD0B924E6174438">
private, has hitherto been founded. Na|tions have proceeded no farther. Per|haps in a more improved &s;tate of &s;ociety, the time will come, when a different &s;y&s;tem may be introduced, when it &s;hall be found more congenial to the &s;o|cial nature of man to exclude the idea of &s;eparate property, and with that the numerous evils which &s;eem to be entail|ed upon it. But it is not my intention in this work to enter upon that enquiry.</P>
<P>When the feudal &s;y&s;tem, with all its ferocities, was in full operation, the &s;u|perior lord, who repre&s;ented the power of the &s;tate, granted the lands to his im|mediate va&s;&s;als, on condition of military &s;ervice. They engaged to &s;erve in the wars of the lord Paramount a certain number of days in the year, at their own expence. Thus they &s;tipulated as to the <HI>quantity</HI> of &s;ervice; but gave up the right of private judgment, as to the <HI>ob|ject of the war.</HI> This is the origin of the revenue &s;y&s;tem of modern Europe; and it began by deba&s;ing the minds of the whole community; as it hurried them into actions, of which they were not to
<PB N="13" REF="026617_0011_0FD0B926616A4A70">
enquire into the ju&s;tice or propriety. Then came the <HI>&s;ocage tenures;</HI> which were lands granted to another cla&s;s of va&s;&s;als, on condition of ploughing the lords fields and performing his hu&s;ban|dry. This was a more rational kind of &s;ervice; though by a &s;hocking pervertion of terms, it was called le&s;s honorable.</P>
<P>In proportion as war became le&s;s pro|ductive, and its profits more precarious than tho&s;e of hu&s;bandry, the tenures upon knight-&s;ervice were converted into &s;ocage-tenures; and finally it was found convenient in mo&s;t ca&s;es, e&s;pecially in England, to make a commutation of the whole in money, in certain fixed &s;ums; and this, by its &s;ub&s;equent mo|difications and extentions, has obtained the name of a land-tax. The&s;e feudal revenues of the crown, though they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ufficient for the ordinary purpo&s;es of government, were capable of being increa&s;ed on any extraordinary oc|ca&s;ion; and &s;uch extraordinary occa&s;i|ons were &s;ure to happen, as often as the government cho&s;e to draw more money from the people. It began this opera|tion

under the name of <HI>aids to the king,</HI> &s;ub&s;idia regis; and, in England (before it was found nece&s;&s;ary to work the en|gine by regular parliaments) various ex|pedients were u&s;ed to rai&s;e from differ|ent cla&s;&s;es of the community the&s;e ex|traordinary aids. In many ca&s;es the au|thority of the pope was brought in to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the king, to enable him to levy money for the court. The pope, as head of the church, received a revenue from the people of England through the Engli&s;h clergy; and the king, on cer|tain occa&s;ions, agreed with him that he &s;hould double his demand; on condi|tion that the additional &s;um to be rai&s;ed, &s;hould be divided between them&s;elves.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cunningham's Hi&s;tory of Taxes, page 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>A perpetual pretext for the&s;e addition|al impo&s;itions was always to be found in foreign wars. Edward the Fir&s;t mu&s;t &s;ubdue the Welch; a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of kings made the glory of the Briti&s;h na|tion to con&s;i&s;t in the reduction of Ire|land; others, in conquering the tomb of Chri&s;t; and others, the crown of France. But in common occurrences, where the
<PB N="15" REF="026617_0013_0FD0B929620B0AC8">
call for money could not be predicated on any national object &s;ufficiently glar|ing to excite the enthu&s;ia&s;m or rou&s;e the fears of the people, it was the policy of the king to detach &s;ome particular cla&s;&s;es of the community from the common inter|e&s;t, and to extort money from them, as from a common enemy. Thus all &s;tran|gers were heavily taxed on coming into the realm; thus Jews, with all the wealth they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, were declared to be the ab&s;olute property of the king;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In one of the laws of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or (which was repeatedly enforced long after the conque&s;t, and perhaps is not repealed to this day) the clau&s;e re&s;pect|ing the Jews is in the&s;e words: <HI>Judoei et omnia &s;ua &s;unt regis; quod in qui&s;piam detinuerit eos, vel pecunium eorum, perquirat rex, &s;i vult, tanquam &s;uum proprium.</HI></NOTE> thus, after the religion of the govern|ment was changed, the papi&s;ts and non|jurors were taxed double to the profe&s;|&s;ors of the national religion; and thus the king could take a &s;avage advantage of the misfortunes of individuals, and &s;eize their property, under the title of <HI>wrecks; waifs, trea&s;ure-trove, &s;trays, amercements</HI> and <HI>forfeitures.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e, and a va&s;t variety of other in|ventions, have been practi&s;ed by the
<PB N="16" REF="026617_0014_0FD0B92AECFFD238">
Engli&s;h government, to legalize partial robberies, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the peo|ple's money, without the trouble of a&s;k|ing for it. But all the&s;e means were in&s;ufficient to &s;upply the unlimited ex|pences of a government founded on Or|ders, Privileges, Rank and Ignorance. The mo&s;t effectual way to carry on the great bu&s;ine&s;s of revenue was found to be through the intervention of a parlia|ment; and for this purpo&s;e the farce of repre&s;entation has been acted over in this country, to much better effect than any &s;pecies of fraud or violence has been in any other.</P>
<P>It would be an in&s;ult to the under|&s;tanding of any reader at this day, to de&s;cribe to him a thing &s;o well known, as the manner in which this game is played between the different branches of the government. The &s;ecret is out; and the friends of the &s;y&s;tem, who u&s;ed to be occupied in concealing its operation, are now engaged in defending it. The drift of their defence is to change the mode of the deception; and per&s;uade the people by <HI>argument,</HI> to &s;uffer to pa&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="026617_0015_0FD0B92C84967FE0">
before their eyes in open day-light, &s;cenes which have hitherto been acted only in the dark. The curtain has fal|len from their hands; and they now de|clare that the play can go on without it. This for England, forms a new era in cabinet politics. While the &s;y&s;tem re|mains the &s;ame, the &s;cheme for carrying it on is totally new-modelled; and, like other novelties in the cour&s;e of hu|man improvement, it becomes a proper &s;ubject of our inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>I have known a juggler, who, after having for a long time excited wonder and drawn money from the multitude, by tricks which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be the effect of magic, would come forward with an engaging frankne&s;s, and declare that there was really nothing &s;uperna|tural in the art; that it was only the ef|fect of a little experience and attention to phy&s;ical cau&s;es, not beyond the ca|pacity of any one in the company; that, though he had deceived them thus far, he was now ready to undeceive them; and, for another fee, he would go through the &s;ame cour&s;e again, with the expla|nations.

This ingenuous confe&s;&s;ion re|doubled their curio&s;ity; the &s;pectators continued their attention, and renewed their contributions.</P>
<P>The government of Great-Britain, under King, Lords and Boroughs, is now defended, both in and out of parli|ament, by arguments unknown to for|mer politicians. As nearly as any words, except the right ones, can expre&s;s the full force of the&s;e arguments, they are &s;tated by their authors in the following language: "No people ever has been or ever can be capable of knowing what is for their own good, of making their own laws, or of pretending to under|&s;tand them after they are made: as the people of England, during the time of the commonwealth, imbibed a different opinion, it has been thought be&s;t, e&s;pe|cially &s;ince the la&s;t revolution, to cheri&s;h them in their error, in order to come more ea&s;ily at their money. We there|fore told them that they were free; that they, as Engli&s;hmen, ought to be free, becau&s;e their ance&s;tors were &s;o; that Engli&s;h liberty was the envy and admi|ration

of the world; that the French were their natural enemies, becau&s;e they were &s;laves; and it was nece&s;&s;ary to make a war once in &s;even years, to keep up this idea; that we are &s;orry for the increa&s;ing burthen of their taxes; but that was a circum&s;tance not to be re|garded by a free people, as they had the privilege of taxing them&s;elves, and their taxes were the price of their freedom in church and &s;tate; that, we intended to le&s;&s;en their burthens as &s;oon as the ene|mies to our religion and to our happy con&s;titution were de&s;troyed. But now, gentlemen, we &s;ee you have di&s;covered, and we are willing to acknowledge, that this was all a deception: as to liberty it is but a name; man gives it up on entering into &s;ociety, in order to enjoy the benefits of being governed; it ne|ver was nor ever will be, realized by any nation under heaven; witne&s;s the horrors of pretended liberty in France, the daily a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations and perpetual robberies which you &s;ee in Mr. Burke's book from beginning to end; witne&s;s the late infatuation of the Americans; who, already recovering their &s;en&s;es, and

We &s;hall &s;ay nothing in fu|ture of the <HI>burthen of taxes,</HI> as it has been fal&s;ly called, the phra&s;e it&s;elf has no longer any meaning; it is now clearly known that public taxes are, in them|&s;elves, a public benefit; every well-wi&s;her to his country mu&s;t wi&s;h them increa&s;e; and for that purpo&s;e he will do all in his power to multiply the oc|ca&s;ions for creating them; for it is ac|knowledged by all good &s;ubjects, that a national debt is national pro&s;perity, and that we grow rich in proportion to the money we pay out.

<P>Let any per&s;on look over the whole chaos of writings and &s;peeches that have been publi&s;hed within the la&s;t year again&s;t innovations in the government, and I believe he will &s;carcely find an argument more or le&s;s than what are here compri|zed. Now this is clearly a different ground from what has heretofore been taken in this country for the &s;upport of the old &s;y&s;tem. It u&s;ed to be thought nece&s;&s;ary to flatter and deceive; but here every thing is open and candid. Mr. Burke, in a frenzy of pa&s;&s;ion, has drawn away the veil; and ari&s;tocracy, like a decayed pro&s;titute, whom painting and patching will no longer embelli&s;h,

<P>It is hard to pronounce with certainty on the &s;ucce&s;s of a project &s;o new; but it appears to me extremely improbable that the naked deformities of de&s;poti&s;m can long be plea&s;ing to a nation &s;o en|lightened as the one to which the&s;e ar|guments are addre&s;&s;ed.

It is certain that the Cardinal de Richelieu has given them different advice.

<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, however, that in the bu&s;ine&s;s of taxation, which is nearly all the bu&s;ine&s;s of a public nature that is done by the government in England; a policy not very different from that of Richelieu, has been practi&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s. The aggregate quantity of the revenue rai&s;ed upon the people has in|deed been &s;omewhat known; but the portion paid by each individual, and the time, manner and rea&s;on of his paying it, are circum&s;tances enveloped in total darkne&s;s. To keep the &s;ubject ignorant of the&s;e things is the great &s;ecret in the modern &s;cience of finance. The money he pays to government being incorpora|ted with every thing on which he lives, all that he can know of the matter is, that whether he eats, drinks or &s;leeps,
<PB N="24" REF="026617_0022_0FD0B936E26FC3F0">
walks or rides, &s;ees the light or breathes the air&mdash;whatever he does, drains from him a tax; and this tax is to &s;upport the lux|ury of tho&s;e who tell him they are born to govern. But on which of the&s;e func|tions the tax falls the heavie&s;t&mdash;whe|ther the greate&s;t proportion lies upon his bread or his beer, his &s;hoes or his hat, his labours or his plea&s;ures, his virtues or his vices, it is impo&s;&s;ible for any man to know. As therefore he cannot di&s;|pen&s;e with the whole of his animal functions, without cea&s;ing to exi&s;t, and as this expedient is not often &s;o eligible as &s;ubmitting to the impo&s;ition, there is no danger but the tax will be collected.</P>
<P>It is difficult to de&s;cribe, perhaps im|po&s;&s;ible to conceive, the quantity of evils wrought in &s;ociety from this mode of collecting revenue by deception; or lay|ing the duty in &s;uch a manner, that the people &s;hall not be &s;en&s;ible when or how it is paid. This is extremely unlike that manly principle of mutual confidence on which men unite in &s;ociety. It is the rever&s;e of that conduct, which, ari&s;ing from the open integrity of our own hearts,
<PB N="25" REF="026617_0023_0FD0B938A208F3A0">
is the guarentee of integrity in others. It is a policy that mu&s;t have originated from two contending intere&s;ts in the nation, from a jealou&s;y of their own power in the legi&s;lative body, from a knowledge that &s;omething was wrong in them&s;elves or in the &s;y&s;tem, and from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that one or the other, or both, were unworthy of the confidence of the people by whom they were &s;up|ported.</P>
<P>I am aware that in the doctrine which I &s;hall labour to e&s;tabli&s;h on this &s;ub|ject, I &s;hall have to encounter the whole weight of opinion of modern times. Men of all parties, and of all de&s;crip|tions, both the friends, and the enemies of equal liberty, &s;eem to be agreed in one point relative to public contributions: <HI>That the tax &s;hould be &s;o far di&s;gui&s;ed, as to render the payment imperceptible at the time of paying it.</HI> This is almo&s;t the on|ly point in which the old and new &s;y&s;|tems agree, in tho&s;e countries where a change of principle has taken place; it is one of tho&s;e rare po&s;itions, on which theori&s;ts them&s;elves have formed but
<PB N="26" REF="026617_0024_0FD0B93B0B587AE0">
one opinion. It is therefore not with|out much reflection, and as great a de|gree of caution as a &s;erious advocate for truth ought ever to ob&s;erve, that I &s;hall proceed to examine a po&s;ition, which, re&s;ting on the accumulated experience of mankind, has not yet been &s;haken by enquiry.</P>
<P>I will begin by acknowledging the force of two ob&s;ervations, which go to the &s;upport of the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem as it applies to mo&s;t of the exi&s;ting govern|ments and to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety in Europe: 1. As long as public reve|nues mu&s;t remain as great as they now are, and as di&s;proportioned to the abili|ties of the people, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to di&s;gui&s;e the taxes on which they depend; otherwi&s;e they cannot be col|lected. 2. As long as the&s;e revenues are applied to the purpo&s;es to which they now are, it is impo&s;&s;ible to collect them but by fraud or violence; and violence has been found by repeated trials, e&s;pe|cially in England, not to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e &s;o well as fraud. While &s;ociety remains divided into two parties, which
<PB N="27" REF="026617_0025_0FD0B93C6E2D8880">
are con&s;titutionally oppo&s;ed to each other, it is impo&s;&s;ible but that they mu&s;t regard each other as enemies, and their conduct mu&s;t be the dictate of mutual aver&s;ion. When the people &s;ee that paying money to their governors, is pay|ing it to their enemies, they certainly never can give it with a good will; and when they know that this money &s;erves only to &s;trengthen the hands of their oppre&s;&s;ors in forging new weapons of oppre&s;&s;ion again&s;t them&s;elves, they mu&s;t feel an obligation lying upon them to withhold it, rather than to pay it. In this ca&s;e, defrauding the revenue is con|&s;idered not only as ju&s;tice to them&s;elves, but as a duty to their children. A tax under the&s;e circum&s;tances is more na|turally objectionable than the <HI>Dane-gelt,</HI> which was formerly paid in England: that contribution was made by the peo|ple, to hire a foreign enemy to leave them in peace; and it always had a tem|porary good effect. But a contribution paid to the people's enemies at home, who being few in number, mu&s;t &s;oon, if un&s;upported, fall of them&s;elves, can|not promi&s;e even a temporary benefit;
<PB N="28" REF="026617_0026_0FD0B941708CD540">
the hand of the enemy that receives it, does not &s;o much as lay down its weapon while it gra&s;ps the money. As long therefore as &s;ociety continues in its pre|&s;ent di&s;ordered condition, any arguments drawn from moral propriety mu&s;t be overpowered by the &s;trong voice of ne|ce&s;&s;ity; for rea&s;ons of nature generally fall in a conflict with rea&s;ons of &s;tate.</P>
<P>But as a new order of things begins to make its appearance, and principle is no longer to be borrowed from prece|dent, we will endeavour to di&s;cover the ground of the received doctrine relative to taxation; and enquire how far that doctrine is, in it&s;elf, an object of reform. Out of the &s;eventeen millions &s;terling which are annually paid into the ex|chequer in England, but about two mil|lions and a half are levied in direct tax|es; that is, in taxes laid in &s;uch a man|ner as to be paid directly to the fi&s;cal officers by the per&s;ons on whom the burthen falls. The&s;e are chiefly com|prehended in the taxes on lands and hou&s;es. In France, before the revolu|tion, the proportion of direct taxes was
<PB N="29" REF="026617_0027_0FD0B942EE95A0F0">
much greater. According to the &s;tate|ment of M. Necker, it was near eight millions &s;terling, out of about twenty-four millions and a half, of which the public revenue con&s;i&s;ted. This is &s;ome|thing le&s;s than a third; while the pro|portion in England is little more than a &s;eventh. The&s;e proportions are &s;uppo|&s;ed by &s;ome of the mo&s;t approved rea|&s;oners on the &s;ubject, in each country, particularly M. Necker and Sir John Sinclair, to be as high as it would be prudent to go with direct taxation. The remaining portion of the immen&s;e revenues in the&s;e two kingdoms, about &s;ixteen millions and a half for France, and fourteen and a half for England, was rai&s;ed in the former, and is &s;till rai&s;ed in the latter, by indirect taxation; by cu&s;|toms, exci&s;e, and inland duties of vari|ous kinds, called <HI>taxes on con&s;umption.</HI> The art of impo&s;ing the&s;e, &s;o as to in|&s;ure their collection, is to incorporate the &s;um to be rai&s;ed for government with the price of every thing for which men pay their money in the cour&s;e of life. It is the hook within the bait of all our plea&s;ures, of all our convenien|ces,
<PB N="30" REF="026617_0028_0FD0B9447B0957A0">
and of all our nece&s;&s;aries. The hook cannot be &s;eparated from the bait, nor the bait from our exi&s;tence. With re|gard to individuals, the que&s;tion is not, &s;hall we pay the tax? but, &s;hall we ex|i&s;t? The continuance of life is a conti|nuance of the tax; and the language of the &s;y&s;tem is, pay the debt to govern|ment, or pay the debt to nature.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid in Ethics, on the &s;ubject of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> that, &s;uppo&s;ing there is no choice of action, there can be no moral agency, and no virtue. We will not en|quire into the propriety of the &s;uppo&s;i|tion or of the con&s;equences drawn from it, as it re&s;pects our relation to the Dei|ty, and our &s;ubjection to the great laws of nature; but there can be no doubt that the rea&s;oning is ju&s;t, when applied to the laws of &s;ociety. Perhaps it is true, that, where I am prompted by the invi&s;ible de&s;tiny of nature, to do an ac|tion for the good of my fellow-creatures, this action is virtuous; but when the nece&s;&s;ity for this action ari&s;es directly from the po&s;itive laws of &s;ociety, in who&s;e favor it is to be performed&mdash;when
<PB N="31" REF="026617_0029_0FD0B945E1F1D990">
the argument derives its force from the ax held over my neck, no idea of virtue can be annexed to the action; it is merely mechanical. On this ground we may e&s;tabli&s;h a po&s;ition, which I believe will not be controverted: that the exerci&s;e of <HI>private judgment</HI> is the foundation of <HI>moral virtue;</HI> and con&s;e|quently, that all operations of govern|ment carry de&s;truction to the latter, in proportion as they deprive us of the for|mer. An arbitrary order impo&s;ed by a ma&s;ter, whether it be upon a nation or a &s;imple dome&s;tic &s;ervant, tends to de|ba&s;e the mind, and cru&s;h that native dignity which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of merit, or of &s;elf-appro|bation. And the effect that &s;uch an or|der produces on the mind is nearly the &s;ame, whether the action enforced be right or wrong.</P>
<P>The true object of the &s;ocial compact is to improve our moral faculties, as well as to &s;upply our phy&s;ical wants; and where it fails in the fir&s;t of the&s;e, it certainly will fail in the la&s;t. But where the moral purpo&s;e is attained, there can
<PB N="32" REF="026617_0030_0FD0B94764037B80">
be no fear but that the phy&s;ical one will be the in&s;eparable con&s;equence; place &s;ociety on this footing, and there will be no aid or duty that the general in|tere&s;t can require from individuals, but what every individual will under&s;tand. His duties, when fir&s;t propo&s;ed, will all be voluntary, and being clearly under|&s;tood to be founded on the good of the whole community, he will find a greater per&s;onal intere&s;t in the performance than he would in the violation. There is no po&s;ition more undeniable in my appre|hen&s;ion, than that this would always be the ca&s;e with a great majority of any people; and if we &s;uppo&s;e a &s;mall por|tion of refractory per&s;ons, who, from want of original con&s;ent, or from a &s;ub|&s;equent change of opinion, &s;hould refu&s;e to perform their duties; in this ca&s;e, the opinions of the great majority a&s;&s;ume the &s;hape of government, and procure a compliance by compul&s;ion and re&s;traint. This is the only &s;ure foundation on which we can ever build the real dignity of &s;o|ciety or the corre&s;ponding energy of go|vernment. It is e&s;tabli&s;hing the moral relations of men on the moral &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="33" REF="026617_0031_0FD0B948E1377AA0">
men; and it is this union alone that can cheri&s;h our e&s;teem or command our re&s;|pect.</P>
<P>On this plan, it is of the utmo&s;t im|portance that the wants of the &s;tate &s;hould never be di&s;gui&s;ed, and that the duty of the individual, in &s;upplying tho&s;e wants, &s;hould never be performed by deception. If the &s;tate be properly or|ganized, &s;uch di&s;gui&s;e and deception will be unnece&s;&s;ary; and if we wi&s;h to pre&s;erve it from degeneration, they will be extremely dangerous; as, by attack|ing the moral &s;en&s;e of the people, they &s;ap the foundation of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>When a company of merchants, or other private men, engage in an enter|terpri&s;e that requires contributions in money, we hear of no difficulties in rai&s;|ing the &s;tipulated &s;ums among the dif|ferent partners in the company. Eve|ry partner makes it his bu&s;ine&s;s to un|der&s;tand the nature of the concern; he expects an advantage from the enterpri&s;e, and pays his money with the &s;ame wil|lingne&s;s, as he would pay it in his pri|vate bu&s;ine&s;s. He would feel him&s;elf
<PB N="34" REF="026617_0032_0FD0B94A63B85538">
in&s;ulted, if any di&s;gui&s;e were thrown upon the &s;ubject, to cheat him into his duty. Indeed, when the enterpri&s;e has come to an end, or when there is an ap|prehen&s;ion of lo&s;s, or a &s;u&s;picion of mi&s;|management in the agents, it is natural to expect a reluctance in payment, which is only to be overcome by the arts of de|ception or the compul&s;ion of law. But this is not the ca&s;e while the company is in a pro&s;perous condition, and while its members are united by mutual confi|dence in pur&s;uit of a common intere&s;t. A nation, who&s;e government &s;hould be habitually in the hands of the whole community, would always be a compa|ny in this pro&s;perous condition; its concerns would be a perpetual and pro|mi&s;ing enterpri&s;e, in which every indi|vidual would find his intere&s;t and re|po&s;e his confidence. Per&s;onal protec|tion and public happine&s;s would be the objects aimed at in the admini&s;tration; and the&s;e would be infallibly attained, becau&s;e no human accidents could pre|vent it. There could be no &s;u&s;picion of mi&s;management in the agents, they be|ing perpetually under the controul of
<PB N="35" REF="026617_0033_0FD0B94BE1FC7468">
the whole people. Every rea&s;on, there|fore, which could induce individuals to withhold their pecuniary contributions, would be entirely removed; and the &s;ame motives which influence a man to give his attention and pay his money in his own per&s;onal concerns, would en|gage him to do the &s;ame things in the concerns of the public.</P>
<P>If the&s;e po&s;itions are not true, then have I mi&s;conceived the character of the human heart, and the real effects to be wrought on &s;ociety by a rational &s;y&s;|tem of government; but if they are ac|knowledged to be true, it ought to be an indi&s;pen&s;able maxim to aboli&s;h and avoid every ve&s;tige of indirect taxation. It mu&s;t appear evident, that to rai&s;e mo|ney from the people by any other me|thod, than by openly a&s;&s;igning to every one his portion, and then demanding that portion as a direct contribution, is unnece&s;&s;ary to the object of revenue, and de&s;tructive to the fir&s;t principles of &s;oci|ety. It has long been complained of in England (&s;o long that the complaint has almo&s;t cea&s;ed to make any impre&s;&s;ion

even on the minds of tho&s;e who repeat it) that <HI>the Exci&s;e is an odious tax.</HI> The rea&s;on on which the complaint is found|ed is what the principle of government, and of the oppo&s;ition to the government, would naturally &s;ugge&s;t; but it is not the rea&s;on which I &s;hould a&s;&s;ign. The tax is &s;aid to be odious, chiefly becau&s;e it throws a vexatious power into the hands of the revenue officers, to &s;earch the hou&s;es and in&s;pect the affairs of in|dividuals. As long as the government and the people are two oppo&s;ite parties in the &s;tate, at continual enmity with each other, it is natural that each party &s;hould wi&s;h to conceal its operations, the better to &s;ucceed in their mutual ho&s;tili|ty and defence; for &s;ecrecy is one of the weapons of war. But if the &s;tate con&s;i&s;ted of nothing more than one great &s;ociety compo&s;ed of all the people, if the government was their will, and its ob|ject their happine&s;s, the rea&s;ons for &s;e|crecy would cea&s;e, the inte&s;tine war would cea&s;e, the parties would cea&s;e.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate and the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of individuals might be &s;afely ex|po&s;ed

to all the world. An open gene|ro&s;ity of conduct, the reciprocal &s;ign and guarentee of integrity, would mark the character of every member of &s;ocie|ty, whether acting as a public agent, or as a private citizen.</P>
<P>But the great objection which ought to be made again&s;t the Exci&s;e, is the &s;ame as will apply to Cu&s;toms, Duties, and all other tricks of a &s;imilar kind, by which the money is drained from the people without their knowledge or con|&s;ent. The whole &s;y&s;tem of indirect taxation, &s;o univer&s;al in Europe, &s;o much extolled by the able&s;t financiers, as ne|ce&s;&s;ary in compo&s;ing their enormous ma&s;&s;es of extorted revenue, is wrong from its foundation, and mu&s;t be vicious in its practice. It is built on the great ari&s;tocratical principle, that men mu&s;t be governed by fraud; and it can be on|ly nece&s;&s;ary to that &s;y&s;tem of manage|ment which divides the nation into two permanent parties, the party that re|ceives and the party that pays.</P>

This rea&s;oning may likewi&s;e be thought worthy of con|&s;ideration in the United States of Ame|rica; where perhaps it may be follow|ed by the &s;ame effects. With re&s;pect to the other countries, we mu&s;t wait.

has taught them to judge with &s;e|verity on the various perver&s;ities of hu|man nature, will find many obvious ob|jections to a theory different from that on which their practice has been found|ed. If I do not anticipate all their ar|guments in form, I certainly mean to do it in &s;ub&s;tance; for I am not unap|pri&s;ed of their weight. Where the re|venue is to be rai&s;ed only for <HI>hone&s;t</HI> pur|po&s;es, and where it is to be kept within a moderate compa&s;s, &s;o that the taxes are to be no more than what a well-or|ganized community would be willing to lay upon it&s;elf, all arguments again&s;t rai&s;ing the whole by direct taxation are deducible to the&s;e two points: the <HI>im|provident</HI> temper of one cla&s;s of men, and the unrea&s;onable <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> of others, have always rendered it difficult to ob|tain from them their contributions by direct and open means. The fir&s;t of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es comprehends many of the poor labouring people in the great towns. The&s;e people are in the habit of &s;pend|ing all they can earn, if not for the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life, at lea&s;t for &s;uperfluous or vicious gratifications. They never

provide for a future want, even their own; much le&s;s would they think of providing for the wants of the &s;tate. As it is vain to a&s;k for money where it does not exi&s;t, no tax can be collected by ap|plying directly to that cla&s;s of men. It is therefore thought be&s;t to mingle the tax with their meat and drink; and, &s;ince they will &s;pend all their money for the&s;e, let a part of it go to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>To this argument &s;everal an&s;wers may be offered: <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> it is in a great mea|&s;ure owing to the inherent defects of the government, that &s;uch a cla&s;s of impro|vident men is found in any &s;ociety. That men of good intellects and &s;ound con&s;titutions &s;hould be inattentive to the means of procuring happine&s;s, is cer|tainly contrary to the analogy of nature. Indeed we overlook the cau&s;e when we go back to nature for it; there is no doubt but it is always to be found in their relative &s;ituation in the &s;ocial &s;tate. It is the want of early in&s;truction, or the want of proper objects of emulation to &s;timulate the mind to a &s;en&s;e of its own dignity, as relative to the &s;ociety in
<PB N="45" REF="026617_0043_0FD0B95BE72A61E8">
which it had to act. When the man is taught to know and feel that he never can ri&s;e above the condition of a bea&s;t of burthen, he acts at lea&s;t a con&s;i&s;tent part, perhaps even a wi&s;e part, in blunting his feelings, and beating down his mind to the level of his de&s;tination. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e that per&s;ons in general, who are found in the cla&s;s above de&s;cribed, have to go through the &s;ame proce&s;s of rea&s;oning, and then of killing their rea&s;on, in order to arrive at this condition. Such indeed mu&s;t have been the origin of the bu&s;ine&s;s in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance; but afterwards, the greater part are <HI>born</HI> in this element of apathy: they are &s;urrounded all their lives by no other examples but beings of this &s;ort; and they never have a thought or wi&s;h be|yond their pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Their on|ly object is to bani&s;h all thought and &s;tifle every wi&s;h; and whether they peri&s;h un|der the walls of an ale-hou&s;e, or in a king's &s;hip, or on the king's gallows, is to them a matter of perfect indifference.</P>

new range of &s;peculation into human nature, extending to a length which I fear would be di&s;proportionate to the li|mits a&s;&s;igned to this chapter. I cannot be &s;atisfied with the common opinions we have entertained in regard to the ef|fect that <HI>property</HI> would naturally have upon the human mind. I &s;ay <HI>naturally,</HI> not in contradi&s;tinction to the <HI>&s;ocial</HI> &s;tate, but in contradi&s;tinction to the <HI>unnatural</HI> &s;tate, in which government, founded on conque&s;t or accident, has hitherto placed mankind. A natural &s;tate of &s;ociety, or a nation organized as human rea&s;on would dictate, for the purpo&s;e of &s;up|plying the greate&s;t quantity of our phy|&s;ical wants, with the corre&s;ponding im|provement of our moral faculties, has never yet been thoroughly tried. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed therefore that the opinions we have formed of the human heart &s;tand a chance of being erroneous; as they have been forme under the di&s;|gui&s;e of impre&s;&s;ions which do not be|long to its nature. The picture of man could not have been fairly drawn while he &s;at with a veil upon his face. The&s;e

facts being premi&s;ed, if we wi&s;h to come at his genuine character, the hi&s;tory of his actions mu&s;t be received with parti|cular caution; as but little reliance can be had upon their te&s;timony. The la|byrinths of error in which he has been forced to wander, the delu&s;ive tapers with which he has been conducted, and the load of abu&s;es under which he has had to &s;truggle, mu&s;t have dimmed his under&s;tanding and deba&s;ed his moral powers, to a degree that cannot yet be accurately known. He ri&s;es into light, a&s;toni&s;hed at what he is, a&s;hamed of what he has been, and unable to conjec|ture at what he may arrive.</P>
<P>Some general traits, however, may be di&s;covered in his character, and re|cognized as the genuine &s;tamp of na|ture. Among the&s;e may be reckoned a certain de&s;ire in every individual of ob|taining the good opinion of his fellow-creatures. Some degree of di&s;tinction, at lea&s;t &s;o far as to acquire an individu|ality of character among his equals, and merit their re&s;pect and confidence, is doubtle&s;s natural to man; and whate|ver,

in a true &s;en&s;e, is natural, is, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, laudable. A man, without the artificial aid that &s;ociety gives him, has but two re&s;ources on which he can rely for obtaining this re&s;pect; the&s;e are his <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> and his <HI>moral powers.</HI> By the cultivation of one or both of the&s;e, he renders him&s;elf u&s;eful, and merits the di&s;tinction that he wi&s;hes. Property, which is called, perhaps with &s;ufficient accuracy, the creature of &s;ociety, is &s;e|cured to individuals, only for their pri|vate benefit; or at mo&s;t as a pledge of their attachment to the community, by which it is guaranteed. It is not ex|pected, on the true principles of &s;ociety, that an individual &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of any part of his own property to the benefit of the public. So much of it as the pub|lic requires in contributions, is demand|ed as a right; it belongs to the &s;tate by the nature of the &s;ocial contract, in re|turn for the guarantee of the re&s;t. It cannot be intended therefore that this &s;hould be the way in which a man &s;hould u&s;e his property, to procure to him&s;elf re&s;pect; neither is it &s;o in fact. The reliance he has upon it, for the purpo&s;e
<PB N="52" REF="026617_0050_0FD0B9656A1E97C0">
of re&s;pect, is founded on a different principle. Except &s;uch proportion as is nece&s;&s;ary in &s;upplying his per&s;onal wants, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or makes u&s;e of his property as a &s;ign, or as a &s;ub&s;titute, of per&s;onal merit. Indeed &s;o far as his property is the fruit of his own exer&s;ions, it is not an unnatural indication of abilities; and even where it has de&s;cended to him from his ance&s;tors, it is not a more unrea&s;on|able ground of pretention, than heredi|tary titles of any other de&s;cription.</P>
<P>On this principle, it is ea&s;y to trace the beginnings of a deviation from a ra|tional e&s;timate of things, in our attach|ment to property. A government which had been founded in violence, and was to be carried on for the exclu&s;ive bene|fit of a &s;mall proportion of the commu|nity, mu&s;t have been under the nece&s;&s;i|ty, at all times, of &s;upporting it&s;elf by impo&s;ition. This circum&s;tance goes at once to the di&s;couragement and di&s;gui&s;e of the <HI>moral powers</HI> of individuals; as they mu&s;t cea&s;e to be cultivated, the mo|ment they cea&s;e to be re&s;pected. As the nation, at the &s;ame time, grew more
<PB N="53" REF="026617_0051_0FD0B966E1FF9148">
numerous, and the &s;ucce&s;s of war and other great operations were found to de|pend le&s;s on <HI>bodily &s;trength,</HI> this too be|gan to lo&s;e its e&s;timation, and could no longer be relied on, as a title to re&s;pect. A natural re&s;ource therefore&punc; by which to e&s;cape from the&s;e unnatural re&s;tricti|ons, was found in a veneration for external and fallacious &s;igns of merit, appropria|ted to individuals. This was the ori|gin of all hereditary titles of honor; and it mu&s;t likewi&s;e have been the origin, at lea&s;t in a great mea&s;ure, of our exce&s;&s;ive attachment to property.</P>
<P>There is another point of view in which this theory may be placed, that will &s;how it to be &s;till more probable. In the &s;ame proportion as this ve|neration for property offered a re&s;ource to individuals, on their giving up the natural rights of cultivating their per&s;on|al talents, it al&s;o became a nece&s;&s;ary en|gine in the hands of the government. It is ea&s;y to perceive, that, in a &s;y&s;tem where every thing depends on heredita|ry rank, the per&s;on placed at the head
<PB N="54" REF="026617_0052_0FD0B968C6214E30">
ought always to be entitled to the great|e&s;t &s;hare of re&s;pect. And where &s;hould a king &s;eek for this, but in exterior pomp? Neither wi&s;dom nor &s;trength can be made hereditary, but titles and property may. It was ab&s;olutely re|qui&s;ite that tho&s;e qualities, in which the king might be rivalled or &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by his &s;ubjects, &s;hould be brought into di&s;repute; and that all mankind &s;hould fix their admiration on tho&s;e in which he could excel. Governments of this kind are &s;ure to be admini&s;tered in &s;uch a manner, that the king &s;hall always be the riche&s;t man in the nation; and they gene|rally go farther, and make other men rich in proportion to their &s;ervility to him. It is thus that the order of nature is invert|ed, and names are &s;ub&s;tituted for things. The &s;imple u&s;es of <HI>property</HI> are convert|ed into the &s;plendid magnificence of <HI>wealth.</HI> This becomes the great and almo&s;t univer&s;al object of human ambi|tion&punc; it excites the gaze and veneration of all cla&s;&s;es of men. Individuals are really not to be blamed, nor their judg|ment to be called in que&s;tion, for this manner of e&s;timating things. Exterior

pomp is, in fact, more u&s;eful to them, than per&s;onal qualifications. It indeed often takes place of all the &s;olid enjoy|ments of life; and it never can be &s;trange that it &s;hould do &s;o, as long as it pro|cures that re&s;pect, the de&s;ire of which is doubtle&s;s among the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;i|ons of our nature.

<P>Such is the pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;uch, I be|lieve, is the <HI>origin</HI> of the inordinate pa&s;|&s;ion for property, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of manners.

The idea of relying on the glare of exterior pomp, whether it be of wealth or hereditary rank, mu&s;t be regarded as what it re|ally is in fact, the effort of a weak mind to cover its own weakne&s;s.

<P>Here we mu&s;t take a review of that mode of anticipation, which is com|mon to mo&s;t of the modern govern|ments of Europe, and known by the name of the <HI>funding &s;y&s;tem.</HI> This in|vention (for &s;o the art of funding is &s;ometimes called) has received from the hands of different writers, a con&s;idera|ble degree of cen&s;ure, as well as much unqualified and injudicious prai&s;e. In|deed, when con&s;idered with reference to its wide &s;weep of attending circum|&s;tances, it pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the mind un|der a variety of a&s;pects, and forms al|together a &s;tupendous object of medita|tion; having produced effects that have far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the limits of previous cal|culation or belief. In politics and war,
<PB N="69" REF="026617_0067_0FD0B97FA1E5B818">
it has changed the face of Europe. With regard to other concerns, both of na|tions and individuals, its effects have been various, contradictory, delu&s;ive, and incapable of accurate e&s;timation. It has a&s;toni&s;hingly multiplied the force and activity of trade; but it has increa&s;|ed in an equal degree the quantity of u&s;e|le&s;s and de&s;tructive &s;peculation. It has converted commerce into a weapon of war; and it has made of that tremen|dous calamity an alluring in&s;trument of commerce. It has brought the&s;e two occupations, &s;o extremely oppo&s;ite in their nature, to a cordial coalition and mutual &s;upport; and thus by the aid of both, it facilitates every project of am|bition in the government; until it fa|miliari&s;es the public mind to a &s;erious acquie&s;cence in a paradox, which mu&s;t have excited the ridicule of any age ac|cu&s;tomed only to common calculation&mdash; That the more a nation is debilitated and exhau&s;ted, the more &s;plendid and powerful it grows. Indeed the &s;y&s;tem is replete with &s;o much apparent good, attended with its &s;olid weight of evils, that we may be thought to incur the
<PB N="70" REF="026617_0068_0FD0B98180A02800">
guilt of partiality or inattention, &s;hould we fail to qualify our cen&s;ure with &s;ome degree of approbation.</P>
<P>But the que&s;tion, Whether the &s;y&s;|tem of funding ought to be admitted in all its latitude, can be decided only by &s;triking the balance of good and evil in the effects that it mu&s;t from its nature produce. And I think, on con&s;idering the &s;ubject as relative to a free republic, the balance will be found much more on the &s;ide of the evil, than it is when applied to the old plans of government.</P>
<P>The benefits, to be derived from the &s;y&s;tem, are of two kinds:&mdash;<HI>commercial,</HI> as it facilitates the bu&s;ine&s;s of individu|als, and <HI>political,</HI> as it aids the govern|ment in the great operations of war. It is well known, or at lea&s;t it is univer|&s;ally believed, that the public debt in England, being funded on the ba&s;is of mortgaging the national revenue for its intere&s;t, has created a prodigious ma&s;s of capital in the hands of trade. By furni&s;hing men with a kind of &s;tock, which they are &s;ure of turning into mo|ney

It is in a great mea&s;ure to this circum&s;tance, that many per&s;ons (per|haps without a due con&s;ideration of cau&s;es) have attributed the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of commerce in this kingdom. In|deed, &s;ince it is found that commerce has increa&s;ed with the augmentation of tax|es, the argument in favor of unlimited funding has become &s;o &s;educing, that the paradox has ari&s;en almo&s;t to a &s;ole|ci&s;m; it is &s;aid that public in&s;olvency is public wealth, and the national debt is it&s;elf a national benefit.</P>
<P>The advantages of a <HI>political</HI> nature, which are derived from the principle of funding, con&s;i&s;t in e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch an unque&s;tionable credit, that the go|vernment can at all times borrow, with|out the means or the intention, or even the promi&s;e of payment. This credit an&s;wers all the purpo&s;e of an inexhau&s;ti|ble trea&s;ury, on which the government

may draw at any moment, and to any amount. It is ea&s;y to conceive the im|men&s;e facility thus given to the mea|&s;ures of admini&s;tration. It enables them to begin, on the &s;horte&s;t notice and with the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy, the mo&s;t expen&s;ive operations, and then to pur&s;ue them to any extent; and this without con&s;ult|ing the wi&s;hes of the nation. It pre|cludues the nece&s;&s;ity of accumulating a national trea&s;ure by previous taxation and economy; a mea&s;ure which mu&s;t always be attended with the di&s;advan|tage of lo&s;ing the u&s;e of the money, from the time it is hoarded, until it is ex|pended. It likewi&s;e avoids the nece&s;&s;i|ty of another operation no le&s;s to be dreaded by officers of government in ge|neral; I mean a &s;udden augmentation of taxes, by which the people &s;hould be called upon to &s;upport the expences of the year, within the year. A mea&s;ure which, if not &s;ometimes impo&s;&s;ible, would often be hazardous to the repu|tation of mini&s;ters, and to the &s;ucce&s;s of extraordinary enterpri&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="026617_0071_0FD0B985F3EFC6C0">Such is the general &s;ummary of the advantages derived from the Funding Sy&s;tem; and this opens to our view the train of evils with which they are con|tra&s;ted.

In the hands of an admini&s;tration, I will not &s;ay <HI>corrupt,</HI> but an admini&s;tration who&s;e intere&s;t is in any mea&s;ure differ|ent from that of the nation at large, this &s;y&s;tem is the mo&s;t dangerous in&s;trument that can be imagined; as it is an in&s;tru|ment of incalculable force, and may be always wielded without oppo&s;ition.

Thus, in the bu|&s;ine&s;s of war, which is the principal ob|ject in the Funding Sy&s;tem, it enables governments to hire men to &s;laughter each other with more than their own &s;words. They wring out of the hard earnings of future generations the means

of de&s;troying the pre&s;ent. Here is a double violence with the generation, that goes to war by the aid of funding, commits on the age that is to follow. It precludes the exi&s;tence of one part of &s;ociety, by de&s;troying tho&s;e who &s;hould have been their progenitors; and it charges the portion of po&s;terity, that e&s;capes into exi&s;tence, with the expences of killing the fellows of their ance&s;tors. And the&s;e expences they mu&s;t pay un|der the cruel di&s;advantage of being de|prived of half their natural re&s;ources, by a diminution of their natural num|bers.</P>

<P>It requires but a &s;light ob&s;ervation on the character of the times in different ages, to &s;how that the object of war, and the &s;pirit with which it is conduct|ed, have been altogether different, with|in the pre&s;ent century, from what they were in more remote periods of modern hi&s;tory. In the maratime nations of Europe, the object of war has changed from religion to commerce; from a point of honor among kings, to a point of profit among merchants, mini&s;ters and generals. The&s;e &s;ubjects have nothing in their nature &s;ufficiently animating to

rou&s;e the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a whole nation to &s;uch a degree, as to render it &s;afe for the projector of a war to apply to the people for their immediate &s;upport. Therefore, to find the means of carry|ing it on, they re&s;ort to a principle con|genial to the object of the war; and it becomes &s;upported, as it is projected, in the &s;pirit of commerce. But, as all of|fen&s;ive wars, in every po&s;&s;ible circum|&s;tance, can only be maintained by de|ceiving the people, the government in this ca&s;e recurs to a commercial decep|tion, and induces them to undertake the burthen, on condition that the weight of it be &s;hifted off to a future peri|od. Such is the origin of funding; and it has evidently ri&s;en out of the nece&s;&s;ity that governments were under, of chang|ing the principle of deception, in order to conform to the &s;pirit of the times.</P>
<P>As an engine of &s;tate, the funding &s;y&s;tem has completely taken place of religious enthu&s;ia&s;m; and mankind have been hurried on to their own de&s;truc|tion by the former, within the two la&s;t ages, with as little prudence and as

For the principle of the &s;y&s;tem is &s;uch as to prevent men from enquiring into the object of the war; as every inducement to &s;uch en|quiry is almo&s;t completely taken away, with re&s;pect to every cla&s;s of &s;ociety. One cla&s;s, by the previous operation of the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem in the increa&s;e of tax|es, are rendered &s;o wretched in their dome&s;tic condition, that they are glad to engage as &s;oldiers in any cau&s;e, for the &s;ake of the pay, &s;o pittifully &s;mall as the pay of a &s;oldier is; another cla&s;s, and one that has great influence on the public opinion, is compo&s;ed of generals, contractors, mini&s;ters and &s;ecretaries, with all their dependants, who are &s;ure to make a profitable jobb of any war, however it be conducted, and whatever be its object; another cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of idle &s;peculators in the funds, who&s;e chance

of gain increa&s;es with the jo&s;tling of public affairs, and e&s;pecially with the augmentation of the debt; while the re&s;t of the community, who cannot be rendered active by the allurements of private profit, are rendered pa&s;&s;ive by deferring the payment of the lo&s;s.</P>
<P>From the time when the predatory &s;pirit, which led the northern Barbari|ans to ravage the &s;outh of Europe, had &s;ub&s;ided, and given place to its natural offspring, in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of feudal monarchy, the hi&s;tory of this quarter of the world begins to a&s;&s;ume a con&s;i&s;tent &s;hape; and it offers it&s;elf to our con|templation, as relative to the &s;pirit of nations, under three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive a&s;pects. The&s;e are the &s;pirit of Hierarchy, the &s;pirit of Chivalry, and the &s;pirit of Com|merce. Out of the&s;e different materi|als the genius of the government has forged in&s;truments of oppre&s;&s;ion almo&s;t equally de&s;tructive. It has never failed to cloud the minds of the nation with &s;ome kind of &s;uper&s;tition, conformable to the temper of the times. In one age it is the &s;uper&s;tition of religion, in ano|ther
<PB N="79" REF="026617_0077_0FD0B98D221D6600">
the &s;uper&s;tition of honor, in another the &s;uper&s;tition of public credit.</P>
<P>The deplorable u&s;e that has been made of the la&s;t of the&s;e, during the pre&s;ent century in England, and for a much longer period in &s;ome other governments, has induced many per&s;ons to regret that the &s;pirit of commerce has ever become predominant over that of chivalry and that of the church. They &s;ee a con|tracted meanne&s;s in the one, which ill compares with the open enthu&s;ia&s;m of the other two. But, before we find fault with what &s;eems to be the order of nature in the&s;e events, we ought to con|&s;ider the effects that it has and will pro|duce, in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety and mo|rals. Chivalry and hierarchy taught us to believe that all men who did not pay homage to the &s;ame monarch, or u&s;e the &s;ame mode of wor&s;hip with our&s;elves, were our natural enemies, and ought to be extirpated. The &s;pirit of commerce has brought us acquainted with tho&s;e people; we find them to be like other men, and that they are really u&s;eful to us in &s;upplying our wants. As their
<PB N="80" REF="026617_0078_0FD0B98EA2F599A8">
exi&s;tence and their pro&s;perity are found to be advantageous to us in a commerci|al point of view, we cea&s;e to regard them as enemies; and refu&s;e to go and kill them, unle&s;s we are hired to do it. But as commerce may deal in human &s;laugh|ter as well as in other things, when ever the government will offer us more mo|ney for de&s;troying our neighbours than we can get by other bu&s;ine&s;s, we are ready to make enemies of our be&s;t friends, and to go to war, as we go to market, on a calculation of profit.</P>
<P>This is the true &s;pirit of commerce, as relative to war. But as this &s;pirit has made us better acquainted with all fo|reign nations, and with our&s;elves, it has excited a di&s;po&s;ition for enquiry into the moral relations of men, with a view to political happine&s;s. The re&s;ult of this enquiry is now beginning to appear. It has already convinced us that there can be no po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e in which one na|tion can be the <HI>natural</HI> enemy of another; and this leads us to di&s;cover the cau&s;e why they have been <HI>factitious</HI> enemies.

nation by its own government, for the private benefit of its admini&s;trators. The &s;ame &s;pirit of enquiry is now lead|ing the people to change the form of their governments, that &s;ociety may be re&s;tored to its proper foundation, the ge|neral happine&s;s of the great community of men.</P>
<P>On examining the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of prin|ciples which mark the character of the times through the&s;e different periods, it appears that, when the &s;pirit of com|merce had become predominant, the only engine of &s;tate, which could be re|lied upon to excite the people to war, was the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a national cre|dit by funding the national debts. And we &s;hould not be wide from the truth in a&s;&s;erting, that to the funding &s;y&s;tem alone the principal commercial nations of Europe are to attribute the wars of the pre&s;ent century, as well as the en|ormous debts under which they have learned to &s;truggle.</P>
<P>Such have been the effects of funding, under the old forms of government; and having a&s;certained the principles on

<P>Men of contemplative minds, as well as tho&s;e of practical knowledge, have now become &s;o generally agreed in the nece&s;&s;ity of the funding &s;y&s;tem, that, though they di&s;cern the evils to which it mu&s;t expo&s;e a nation, I fear it is one of the la&s;t of their e&s;tabli&s;hed maxims that they will be willing to &s;ub|ject to the &s;everity of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The univer&s;al opinion is that a &s;tate cannot exi&s;t without a national credit; unle&s;s it put it&s;elf to the di&s;advantage of hoard|ing up money, and keeping a trea&s;ure in re&s;erve. And this latter mea&s;ure, be&s;ides the inconvenience above-men|tioned, of lo&s;ing the u&s;e of the capital while it lies inactive, would throw into the hands of the executive government,

the &s;ame dangerous power which is en|tru&s;ted to them by the means of credit&punc; in this re&s;pect their rea&s;oning is ju&s;t; and perhaps a full trea&s;ury would be the greate&s;t evil of the two.</P>
<P>But after all, what is the advantage of a national credit? I mean, in the &s;en&s;e in which it is generally under&s;tood, the facility of rai&s;ing a capital on long annuities, by a mortgage of revenue. Shall we not find on an inve&s;tigation of this very &s;imple que&s;tion, that the ad|vantage derived from &s;uch a credit (even &s;uppo&s;ing it never to be abu&s;ed) can on|ly be applicable to the old &s;y&s;tems of government? Will it not appear that it is an advantage totally unnece&s;&s;ary to a rational and manly admini&s;tration, con|ducted by the wi&s;hes of a free and en|lightened people? I am &s;uppo&s;ing, and it is but fair to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch a people will always under&s;tand their own intere&s;t. Or, at lea&s;t, if they make a mi&s;take, it will be the mi&s;take of the nation, not of the mini&s;ters; they will never &s;uffer an enterpri&s;e to be under|taken, but what is agreeable to the ma|jority
<PB N="84" REF="026617_0082_0FD0B994C640D098">
of the active citizens. This peo|ple will never engage in any offen&s;ive war. Indeed, as &s;oon as the &s;urround|ing nations adopt the &s;ame change of government, the bu&s;ine&s;s of war will be forgotten; but in the interval, previ|ous to this event, a real republic can|not &s;tand in need of funds, as a prepa|rative for war, unle&s;s it be invaded. It is even &s;afer without funds; becau&s;e they might be a temptation to the offi|cers of government to counteract the &s;pirit of the republic. In ca&s;e &s;uch a people be really attacked by an enemy, then it is that the force of &s;ociety may be &s;een and calculated. But the calcu|lation does not turn on the cabinet-rules of royal arithmetic; the power of the republic for the purpo&s;e of defence does not depend on a national credit, in the &s;en&s;e above-mentioned, or the faci|lity of borrowing money; the govern|ment, in making up its e&s;timate of re|&s;i&s;tance, never a&s;ks, how many &s;oldi|ers have we in pay? And how many recruits can we enli&s;t or impre&s;s? But of how many men does the nation con&s;i&s;t? Armies &s;tart into being by a &s;pontane|ous

impul&s;e; every citizen feels the cau&s;e to be his own, and pre&s;ents his per&s;on or his provi&s;ions and his arms, not as an offering to a tyrannical ma&s;ter, of who&s;e intentions he would be &s;u&s;pi|cious, but as a defence of his own fa|mily and property. The enemy being repul&s;ed, whatever inequalities may be found to have ari&s;en in this emulous contribution, are liquidated and &s;ettled on a general &s;cale of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Even &s;uppo&s;ing the war to be of long continuance&punc; and to require &s;ums of money beyond the voluntary contribu|tions, and beyond the power of pru|dent taxation for the time; (which in|deed, in a wealthy and well regulated republic, would be an extraordinary thing, and I believe never would oc|cur) in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e, and the natural magnanimity which habitual freedom in&s;pires, would be a &s;ufficient guarantee for loans, at home or abroad. It is true in nature, and the truth mu&s;t prove it&s;elf beyond contradiction to the world, as &s;oon as

it &s;hall have opportunity to judge, that a great people accu&s;tomed to exerci&s;e their rights, would never violate their duties.</P>
<P>Inju&s;tice may be expected from gov|ernments founded in u&s;urpation; it is their natural character, the tenure on which they hold their authority. They never can be ju&s;t, unle&s;s they deviate from their principle. What is called their <HI>penal ju&s;tice,</HI> as well as their <HI>pecu|niary ju&s;tice,</HI> is only the fruit of their fears; and ought to be regarded only as an evidence of their con&s;titutional weakne&s;s. As every thing they do, mu&s;t be done by the force of money, it is nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h a character for mercantile punctuality, to &s;erve as a &s;ub&s;titute for the quality of ju&s;tice, which quality the nature of their exi&s;tence denies them. The re|ver&s;e of this is the ca&s;e with govern|ments founded in rea&s;on and nature, where all the people have an active in|tere&s;t. Ju&s;tice there is the fir&s;t article in the &s;ocial compact; and as neither policy nor principle can ever admit of a

deviation from this, the event is not to be expected.</P>
<P>This is the kind of national credit that is proper for a free republic. It is involved in the nature of their &s;y&s;tem, and &s;purns tho&s;e extraneous aids which artificial credits have required. I &s;hould con&s;ider it as a circum&s;tance dangerous to the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, if the new re|publics, which are to rai&s;e out of the ruins of the&s;e antiquated ma&s;&s;es of er|ror, &s;hould retain the two great princi|ples of finance, on which much of that error has been &s;upported. To rai&s;e the revenue by <HI>di&s;gui&s;ing the taxes,</HI> and to force a public credit by <HI>dint of fund|ing,</HI> have been equally nece&s;&s;ary to the ancient &s;y&s;tem; and it appears to me that they would be equally de&s;tructive to the new.</P>
<P>How the national debts that now ex|i&s;t in &s;everal countries, are to be di&s;po|&s;ed of, under a change of government, is indeed a que&s;tion of &s;erious magni|tude. Probably that of France will be nearly extingui&s;hed by the &s;ale of the national domains. That of Spain, and
