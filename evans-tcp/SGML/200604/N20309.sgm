<HEAD>A PRELIMINARY DISSERTATION. On the Circumnavigation of <HI>AFRICA</HI> by the <HI>AN|CIENTS</HI>; and its probable Con&s;equence, the Popu|lation of &s;ome Part of <HI>AMERICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t navigators, of whom we have any account, were the Phenicians, who were &s;cattered along the coa&s;ts of the Mediterranean and of the Red Sea. As early as the days of Mo&s;es, they had extended their navigation beyond the pillars of Hercules, on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa, toward the &s;outh; and as far northward as the i&s;land of Britain, whence they imported tin and lead,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Numbers, chap. xxxi, ver. 22.</NOTE> which according to the univer&s;al te&s;timony of the ancients, were not then found in any other country.</P>
<P>From the accounts given in ancient hi&s;tory of the expeditions of Se&s;o&s;tris, King of Egypt, &s;ome have been led to conclude, that he made a di&s;covery of <HI>all</HI> the coa&s;ts of Africa.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For&s;ter's Hi&s;tory of Voyages and Di&s;coveries, page 7.</NOTE> However this might be, there is no doubt that he opened, or revived a com|mercial intercour&s;e with India and Ethiopia, by way of the Red Sea. It hath al&s;o been thought that the voyages of the Phenicians and Hebrews to Ophir, in the time of Solomon, were nothing more nor le&s;s than circumnavigations of Africa.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="026637_0004_0FD0F9770A5A8EF8">But, leaving the&s;e, for the pre&s;ent, in the region of conjecture; the earlie&s;t regular account which we have, of any voyage round the continent of Af|rica, is that performed by order of Necho, King of Egypt, and recorded by Herodotus; the mo&s;t an|cient hi&s;torian, except the &s;acred writers, who&s;e works have come down to our time. His character as a hi&s;torian is, "candid in his acknowledgment of what is uncertain, and ab&s;olute when he &s;peaks of what he knows.' The date of Necho's reign is fixed by Rollin 616 years before Chri&s;t. The date of Herodotus hi&s;tory is placed by Dufre&s;noy in the third year of the 83d Olympiad, an&s;wering to 446 years before Chri&s;t. So that he mu&s;t have penned his narration of this voyage, in le&s;s than two centu|ries after it was performed. I &s;hall give his account at large, in a literal tran&s;lation, from the Geneva edition of his work, in Greek and Latin, by Stepha|nus.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. iv, chap. 42.</NOTE> In de&s;cribing the &s;everal great divi&s;ions of the earth, he &s;peaks thus:</P>
<P>"I wonder at tho&s;e who have divided and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Lybia,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lybia is the name by which the whole continent of Africa was called by the Greeks.</NOTE> A&s;ia and Europe, between which there is not a little difference. If indeed Europe agrees with the others in length, yet in breadth it does not &s;eem, to me, worthy to be compared. For, Lybia &s;hews it&s;elf to be <HI>&s;urrounded by the &s;ea,</HI> ex|cept where it joins to A&s;ia. Necos, King of the Egyptians, being the fir&s;t of tho&s;e, whom we know,

to demon&s;trate it. After he had de&s;i&s;ted from dig|ging a ditch from the Nile to the Arabian gulf (in which work above twenty thou&s;and Egyptians pe|ri&s;hed; he betook him&s;elf to rai&s;ing armies and building &s;hips, partly in the north &s;ea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the north &s;ea is meant the Mediterranean, which lies north of Egypt.</NOTE> and partly in the Arabian gulf, at the Red Sea, of which they yet &s;how &s;ome remains.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. ii, chap. 48.</NOTE>) He &s;ent certain Pheni|cians in &s;hips, commanding them, that having pa&s;&s;|ed the pillars of Hercules, they &s;hould penetrate the north &s;ea, and &s;o return to Egypt. The Pheni|cians therefore loo&s;ing from the Red Sea, went away into the &s;outhern &s;ea, and, directing their &s;hips to land, <HI>made a &s;eed time,</HI> at the end of au|tumn, that they might expect a harve&s;t, and might a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly coa&s;t Lybia. Then, having gathered the harve&s;t, they &s;ailed.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Into whatever part of Lybia &s;eamen came, they waited for harve&s;t, and when they had reaped, they loo&s;ed from the &s;hore."
<BIBL>Note of Stephanus.</BIBL></NOTE> Thus, two years being con&s;umed; in the third year, coming round the pillars of Hercules, they returned to Egypt; re|porting things which with me have no credit, but may perhaps with others, that <HI>in &s;ailing round Lybia they had the Sun on the right hand.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">i. e. They being in the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere and &s;ailing north|ward, &s;aw the Sun ri&s;e on the right hand.</NOTE> In this manner it was fir&s;t known.</P>
<P>"In the &s;econd place, the Carthaginians, have &s;aid, that a certain Sata&s;pes, &s;on of
<PB N="8" REF="026637_0006_0FD102A0A29F4FD0">
of Tea&s;pis, a man of the Achamenides did not &s;ail round Lybia, when he was &s;ent; but being deter|red by the length of the navigation and the &s;olitude of the country, returned home, having not fulfilled the labour which his mother enjoined him. For he had violated a virgin, daughter of Zopyrus, the &s;on of Megaby&s;us; and for that cau&s;e, being by Xerxes condemned to be crucified, his mother, who was &s;i&s;ter to Darius, liberated him; becau&s;e, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he would impo&s;e on him a puni&s;hment greater than the King's command. Wherefore it became nece&s;&s;ary for him to &s;ail round all Lybia, till he &s;hould come to the Arabian gulf. Xerxes con&s;enting to this, Sata&s;pes went into Egypt, and, having there taken a &s;hip and companions, &s;ailed to the pillars of Hercules. Having pa&s;&s;ed them, and having doubled the promontory of Lybia call|ed Syloes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now called Cape Bojador in the 26th degree of north lati|tude.</NOTE> he kept a &s;outhern cour&s;e. Having traver&s;ed much of the &s;ea in many months, and find|ing much more time nece&s;&s;ary, he turned about and came back to Egypt. Returning to Xerxes, he re|ported, that in vi&s;iting the remote&s;t coa&s;ts, he had &s;een &s;mall men, clothed in Phenician garments; who, at the approach of his &s;hip, fled to the moun|tains and left their villages; which he entered, and took nothing from them but cattle. He gave this rea&s;on for not having &s;ailed round Lybia, that his &s;hip could &s;ail no farther; but was &s;topped. Xer|xes did not believe him, and becau&s;e he had not
<PB N="9" REF="026637_0007_0FD102A2C07F1B10">
performed his engagement, ordered him to under|go his de&s;tined puni&s;hment."</P>
<P>To the authenticity of this circumnavigation of the African continent, the following objections have been made:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it is &s;aid that "the ve&s;&s;els which the ancients employed, were &s;o &s;mall as not to afford &s;towage for provi&s;ions, &s;ufficient to &s;ub&s;i&s;t a crew during a long voyage."</P>
<P>Secondly, "their con&s;truction was &s;uch that they could &s;eldom venture to depart far from land, and their mode of &s;teering along the coa&s;t was &s;o circuit|ous and &s;low, that we may pronounce a voyage from the Mediterranean to India, by the Cape of Good Hope, to have been an undertaking beyond their power to accompli&s;h; in &s;uch a manner as to render it in any degree &s;ub&s;ervient to commerce. To this deci&s;ion, the account pre&s;erved by Herodo|tus of a voyage performed by &s;ome Phenician &s;hips employed by the King of Egypt, can hardly be con|&s;idered as repugnant."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Robert&s;on's India, p. 175, American edition.</BIBL>
The objections taken from this learned author were not made directly again&s;t the voyage mentioned by Herodotus; but rather again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of a pa&s;&s;age to India by way of the Atlantic Ocean, and round the African continent. However, as he brings this voyage into view in the &s;ame argument, and &s;peaks of it du|biou&s;ly, it is conceived that his &s;entiments are not mi&s;repre&s;ented in the above quotations.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have cho&s;en to con&s;ider both the&s;e objections together, becau&s;e that each one helps to de&s;troy
<PB N="10" REF="026637_0008_0FD102A4C698F700">
the other. For if the ve&s;&s;els were &s;o &s;mall, as not to contain provi&s;ions for a long voyage, this was one rea&s;on for the navigators to keep their cour&s;e near the land; that they might find water, fruits, game and cattle, on the &s;hore, as well as fi&s;h, on the &s;hoals and rocks near the coa&s;t, for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. And if it was their de&s;ign to keep near the land, for the &s;ake of di&s;covery, &s;mall ve&s;&s;els were be&s;t adapted to the purpo&s;e; becau&s;e they could pa&s;s over &s;hoals, through &s;mall openings, between i&s;lands and rocks, which are generally &s;ituate near the coa&s;ts of great continents. Be&s;ides, if the ve&s;&s;els were &s;mall, they could carry but &s;mall crews, who would not require very large quantities of provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>But Herodotus has helped us to &s;olve the diffi|culty re&s;pecting provi&s;ions, in a manner perfectly agreeable to the practice of antiquity, though un|known to modern navigators. They went on &s;hore and &s;owed corn, and when it was ripe gathered the harve&s;t. This enables us to account for two circum|&s;tances attending the voyage of Necho; the length of time employed, and the &s;upply of provi&s;ion, at lea&s;t of bread, con&s;umed in it.</P>
<P>Nor was the &s;owing and reaping any lo&s;s of time; for the mon&s;oons in the Indian ocean would not permit them to proceed any fa&s;ter. A &s;hip &s;ailing from the Red Sea with the N. E. mon&s;oon, in the &s;ummer or autumn, would meet with the S. W. mon&s;oon, in the beginning of December, which mu&s;t have detained her in &s;ome of the harbours, on
<PB N="11" REF="026637_0009_0FD102A9EF3E5858">
the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa, till the next April. During this time, in that warm climate, corn might be &s;own and reaped; and any other articles, either of provi&s;ion or merchandi&s;e, might be taken on board. Then the N. E. mon&s;oon would carry her to the &s;outhern parts of Africa, into the region of variable winds. This regular cour&s;e and chang|ing of the mon&s;oons was familiarly known to the navigators of Solomon's &s;hips, and was the cau&s;e of their &s;pending three years, in the voyage to and from Ophir. "In going and returning, they changed the mon&s;oon &s;ix times, which made thirty &s;ix months. They needed no longer time to complete the voy|age, and they could not perform it in le&s;s."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bruce's travels&mdash;B. ii, chap. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is not pleaded, that the voyage of Necho was undertaken for the &s;ake of commerce; or, if the authenticity of it were e&s;tabli&s;hed, that it would prove the practicability of a voyage from the Medi|terranean to India, round the Cape of Good Hope, by the ve&s;&s;els then in u&s;e, and the nautical &s;kill then acquired. The voyage of which Herodotus &s;peaks might have been a voyage of di&s;covery; &s;uch an one as was perfectly agreeable to the genius of the people by whom it was performed, and of the prince, by who&s;e order and at who&s;e expen&s;e it was undertaken. "The progre&s;s of the Phenicians and Carthaginians, in their knowledge of the globe, was not owing entirely to the de&s;ire of extending their trade from one country to another. Com|merce was followed by its u&s;ual effects, among both

tho&s;e people. It awakened curio&s;ity, enlarged the ideas and de&s;ires of men, and incited them to bold enterpri&s;es. Voyages were undertaken, the &s;ole object of which was to "<HI>di&s;cover new countries and to explore unknown &s;eas.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's America&mdash;Vol. I, p. 11, 4th edit.</NOTE> The knowledge acquired in the&s;e voyages of di&s;covery might afterwards be &s;ub&s;ervient to commerce; and though the Pheni|cians might not think it convenient, to circumnavi|gate Africa, more than once, yet that they carried on a commercial intercour&s;e with different parts of that country, and particularly with places &s;ituate on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, in the Indian ocean, we have evi|dence from the &s;acred writings. In the reign of Solomon "the king's &s;hips with the &s;ervants of Hiram and the navy of Thar&s;hi&s;h every three years brought ivory,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. viii.18, ix.21.</NOTE> apes and peacocks, be&s;ides &s;ilver and the gold of <HI>Ophir,</HI>" which is with great rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed to be the country now called <HI>Sofala</HI> on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa, in the &s;outhern hemi&s;|phere; as the learned Bruce, in his late book of travels, has &s;atisfactorily proved.</P>
<P>The prophet Ezekiel, who was contemporary with Necho, King of Egypt, in the account which he gives of the merchandi&s;e of Tyre, enumerates &s;ev|eral commodities, which it is well known belong to Africa, "horns of ivory and ebony, and the per&s;ons of men."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezekiel, chap. xxvii, ver. 13, 15.</NOTE> We may form &s;ome idea of the &s;trength and materials of the &s;hips of the Tyrians, and of
<PB N="13" REF="026637_0011_0FD102AD0D645C28">
their &s;kill in navigation, from the following pa&s;&s;ages in his apo&s;trophe to Tyrus. "They have made all thy &s;hip-boards of fir trees of Senir; they have taken cedars of Lebanon to make ma&s;ts for thee; of the oaks of Ba&s;han have they made thine oars. Thy wi&s;e men, O Tyrus, were thy pilots. The ancients of Gebal, the wi&s;e men thereof were thy calkers. The &s;hips of Thar&s;hi&s;h did &s;ing of thee; thou wa&s;t repleni&s;hed and made very glorious in the mid&s;t of the &s;eas; thy rowers have brought thee into great waters." Though we have no particular de&s;|cription of the &s;ize or model of their &s;hips; yet they certainly had ma&s;ts, &s;ails and oars; their pilots and calkers were wi&s;e men, and they were not afraid to &s;ail in great waters, by which is proba|bly meant the Ocean, in di&s;tinction from the Medi|terranean.</P>
<P>Of the form and &s;tructure of the Grecian ve&s;&s;els we have a more particular knowledge. "They were of incon&s;iderable burden, and mo&s;tly without decks. They had only one ma&s;t, and were &s;trang|ers to the u&s;e of anchors."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's America&mdash;Vol. I, p. 15.</NOTE> But then it mu&s;t be remembered, that "the Phenicians, who in&s;tructed the Greeks in other u&s;eful arts, did not communi|cate to them that exten&s;ive knowledge of naviga|tion, which they them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 14.</NOTE> We may hence conclude that the &s;hips of the Phenicians were &s;uperior to the Grecian ve&s;&s;els; and we have no evidence from the &s;tructure of their ve&s;&s;els or their mode of &s;ailing, to warrant a doubt of the abil|ity
<PB N="14" REF="026637_0012_0FD102B11BD2DD20">
of their &s;hips or &s;eamen, to perform a voyage round the continent of Africa in three years.</P>
<P>To an European theori&s;t &s;uch a voyage may &s;eem le&s;s practicable than to an American. The Euro|peans have u&s;ually employed none but &s;hips of great burden, in their trade to India and China; but &s;ince the Americans have vi&s;ited tho&s;e countries, &s;loops of fifty or &s;ixty tons have &s;ailed round the Cape of Good Hope to China, and round Cape Horn to the northwe&s;t coa&s;t of America, and acro&s;s the north Pacific Ocean. If any doubt can yet re|main, it may be entirely removed by the recollection of a voyage performed in the year 1789, by Lieu|tenant Bligh of the Briti&s;h navy; who, being turned adrift by his mutinous crew, traver&s;ed the &s;outh Pacific Ocean, above twelve hundred leagues, in a boat of twenty three feet long, with|out a deck, in much &s;tormy weather, with &s;canty provi&s;ions; and having pa&s;&s;ed many dangerous rocks and &s;hoals, among unknown i&s;lands, arrived in forty one days at a Dutch &s;ettlement in Timor, one of the Moluccas.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the printed narrative by Lieut. Bligh.</NOTE> The objections then again&s;t the reality of Necho's voyage, from the &s;ize and &s;tructure of the Phenician ve&s;&s;els, and the want of provi&s;ion, are not &s;o formidable on examination, as at the fir&s;t appearance.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Since this di&s;&s;ertation was &s;ent to the pre&s;s I have met with the following account of an adventure which adds to the credibil|ity of the circumnavigation of Africa in &s;mall and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>In 1534 when the Portugue&s;e had e&s;tabli&s;hed a government in India; Badur King of Kambaya being at war with the great Mogul &s;ought a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Portugue&s;e and offered them the liberty of building a fort at Diu. As &s;oon as this liberty was granted and the plan of the fort was drawn, James Botello a per|&s;on &s;kilful in the affairs of India, having been in di&s;grace with John King of Portugal, and being anxious to recover the favour of that Prince re&s;olved to carry the fir&s;t news of it to him. Hav|ing obtained a copy of the plan he &s;et out from India in a bark of <HI>&s;ixteen feet and a half long, nine broad and four and a half deep;</HI> with three Portugue&s;e, two others, and his own &s;laves. He pretended that he was going to Kambaya, but when he was out at &s;ea, made known his de&s;ign to go to Li&s;bon; at which they were all a&s;toni&s;hed. Being overcome by fair words they proceeded on their way, till finding them&s;elves reduced to di&s;tre&s;s, the &s;laves agreed to kill Botello; but after killing a &s;ervant they were put to death them&s;elves. With the four who remained, Botello held on his cour&s;e, doubled the &s;outhern cape of Africa and at length arrived at Li&s;bon; where the bark was immediately <HI>burnt</HI>; that no man might &s;ee it was po&s;&s;ible to perform that voyage in &s;o &s;mall a ve&s;&s;el. The King was greatly plea&s;ed with the news, and re&s;tored Botello to his favour, without any other reward for &s;o daring an adventure.</P>

<P><PB N="15" REF="026637_0013_0FD102B3D271D128">A third objection again&s;t the credibility of this early circumnavigation is, that &s;everal writers of the greate&s;t eminence among the ancients, and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for their knowledge of geogra|phy, regarded this account rather as an amu&s;ing tale, than the hi&s;tory of a real tran&s;action; and, either entertained doubts concerning the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ailing round Africa, or ab&s;olutely denied it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's India, p. 175.</NOTE>

<P>A third rea&s;on was the opinion which the wi&s;e&s;t men among the Romans had formed, and to which they ob&s;tinately adhered, concerning the five zones, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of pa&s;&s;ing from one hemi&s;phere to the other, becau&s;e of the torrid zone lying between.

<PB N="18" REF="026637_0016_0FD102B981390CA0">
as related by Herodotus. It is this, that the Phe+nicians, in &s;ailling round Africa, "had the Sun on their right hand;" which Herodotus, with his u&s;ual mode&s;ty and candor &s;ays, "with me has no credit, though it may with others." On this the Doctor, judiciou&s;ly remarks, "The &s;cience of a&s;tronomy was in that early period &s;o imperfect, that it was by experience only, that the Phenicians could come at the knowledge of this fact; they dur&s;t not, without this, have ventured to a&s;&s;ert what would have appeared to be an improbable fiction."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> India, note 54.</NOTE> In|deed if they had not known it by experience, there is not the lea&s;t conceivable rea&s;on for their invent|ing &s;uch a report; nor even for the entrance of &s;uch an idea into their imagination. The mode&s;t doubt of Herodotus is another argument in favour of the truth and genuinene&s;s of it; for as he had no experience to guide him, and the idea was new, it was very proper for him to he&s;itate in admitting it, though he &s;howed his impartiality by in&s;erting it in his relation.</P>
<P>So much for the voyage performed by the Phe|nicians under the orders of Necho, which is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> proof produced by Herodotus, of his po&s;ition, that "Lybia is &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, except where it joins A&s;ia."</P>
<P>His <HI>&s;econd</HI> proof is not &s;o conclu&s;ive, nor is the de&s;ign of his introducing it &s;o obvious. It is the relation of a voyage undertaken by Sata&s;pes a Per|&s;ian, who&s;e puni&s;hment was commuted from cruci|fixion
<PB N="19" REF="026637_0017_0FD102BC2EEBDB28">
to &s;ailing round Lybia; which voyage he began, but returned by the &s;ame route, not having completed it. The rea&s;on which he gave for re|turning was, that "his &s;hip was &s;topped and could &s;ail no farther," which his &s;overeign did not believe, and therefore put him to death, to which he had before been condemned.</P>
<P>The only evidence which this &s;tory can afford is, that the circumnavigation of the African con|tinent was, at that time, thought practicable The mother of Sata&s;pes thought &s;o, or &s;he would not have propo&s;ed it; and Xerxes thought &s;o, or he would not have di&s;believed the &s;tory of the &s;hip being &s;topped; by which expre&s;&s;ion was meant that the &s;ea was no farther navigable, by rea&s;on of land.</P>
<P>The exact date of this voyage is not a&s;certain|ed; but as Xerxes reigned twelve years, and died in the year 473 before Chri&s;t, it could not have been much more than thirty years, preceding the time when Herodotus publi&s;hed his hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The voyage of Hanno, the Carthaginian, is thus briefly mentioned by Pliny: "In the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of Carthage, Hanno having &s;ailed round from Gades [Cadiz] to the border of Arabia, com|mitted to writing an account of his voyage; as did Himilco, who was at the &s;ame time &s;ent to di&s;cover the extreme parts of Europe."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny's Natural Hi&s;tory, lib. 2. cap. 67.</NOTE> The character of Pliny, as a hi&s;torian, is, that "he collected from all

authors, good and bad, who had written before him; and that his work is a mixture of truth and error, which it is difficult to &s;eparate." An in+&s;tance, in confirmation of this remark, occurs in this very chapter; where he &s;peaks of &s;ome mer+chants, &s;ailing from India, and thrown by a tem+pe&s;t, on the coa&s;t of Germany. He al&s;o mentions a voyage, made by Eudoxus, from the Arabian gulf to Gades; and another of Coelius Antipater, from Spain to Ethiopia.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e voyages, that of Hanno is be&s;t authen+ticated. He &s;ailed from Carthage with &s;ixty gal|lies, each carrying fifty oars, having on board thirty thou&s;and men and women, with provi&s;ions and articles of traffic. The de&s;ign of this equip|ment was to plant colonies along the we&s;tern &s;hore of Africa, which the Carthaginians, from priority of di&s;covery, and from its contiguity to their ter|ritory, con&s;idered as their own dominion. Han|no was ab&s;ent five years, on this colonizing expe|dition; but there is no <HI>certainty</HI> of his having pro|ceeded any farther &s;outhward, than the bay of Benin, in the eighth degree of north latitude. A fragment of his journal, which, at his return, he depo&s;ited in the temple of Saturn, at Carthage, is now extant; and though it has been treated as fabulous by &s;everal authors, ancient and modern, yet, its authenticity has been vindicated by M.

Eudoxus returned after the King's death, and was wrecked on the coa&s;t of Ethiopia; where he di&s;covered the prow of a &s;hip, which had &s;uffered the &s;ame fate. It was the figure of a hor&s;e; and a &s;ailor, who had been employed in European voyages, knew this to have been part of one of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, which traded on the Atlantic ocean; of which trade Gades was the principal port. This circum&s;tance amounted to a proof, that there was a pa&s;&s;age round Africa, from the Indian to the Atlan|tic ocean. The di&s;covery was of no greater im|portance to any per&s;on, than to Eudoxus him&s;elf; for, &s;ometime afterward, falling under the di&s;plea|&s;ure of Ptolemy Lathyrus, and being in danger of his life, he fled; and embarking on the Red Sea, &s;ailed round Africa and came to Gades.</P>

of him and of other Roman authors in re&s;pect to the&s;e voyages and di&s;coveries, was the doctrine of the zones; to which they inflexibly adhered, and which entirely precluded all con|viction.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the evidences which I have had opportunity to examine re&s;pecting the que&s;tion of the circumnavigation of Africa,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>For&s;ter,</HI> in his hi&s;tory of voyages and di&s;coveries (chap. i) refers to three German authors, <HI>Ge&s;ner, Schlozer</HI> and <HI>Michaelis,</HI> who have written on this &s;ubject, and ob&s;erves, that "the circum|navigation of Africa by the Phenicians and Egyptians is proved almo&s;t to a demon&s;tration."</NOTE> and, upon the whole, there appears to be this peculiarity attending the &s;ubject, that it was believed by tho&s;e who liv|ed neare&s;t to the time when the voyage of Necho is &s;aid to have been made; and, that in propor|tion to the di&s;tance of time afterward, it was doubt|ed, di&s;believed and denied; till its credibility was e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond all doubt by the Portugue&s;e ad|venturers in the fifteenth century.</P>
<P>The credibility of the Egyptian or Phenician voyages, round the continent of Africa, being ad|mitted, and the certainty of the Carthaginian voy|ages and colonies on the we&s;tern &s;hore of Africa being e&s;tabli&s;hed; we may extend our inquiry to the probability of what has been advanced by &s;ome writers, and doubted or denied by others, the popu|lation of &s;ome part of America from beyond the Atlantic.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="026637_0021_0FD102C77A20BCC0">The di&s;covery of the Canary i&s;lands by the Car+thaginians is a fact well atte&s;ted.

From this circum&s;tance, it mu&s;t appear, that they had been inhabited before the Carthaginian di&s;cov|ery.

<P>But, whether we admit the conjecture, that, be|ing thus obliged to quit the i&s;lands, they "pa&s;&s;ed over to America," or not; yet it is extremely probable, that, in &s;ome of the ancient circumnavi|gations of Africa, or in pa&s;&s;ing to and from the&s;e i&s;lands, or even in coa&s;ting the continent from the &s;traights of Gibraltar, &s;ome ve&s;&s;els might be drawn by currents or driven by tempe&s;ts, within the verge of the trade wind; "which begins not far to the &s;outhward of the &s;traights, and blows nine months of the year, on the coa&s;t of Morocco." In this ca&s;e, it would be next to impo&s;&s;ible, for tho&s;e who had met with any con&s;iderable damage in their ma&s;ts, &s;ails, or rigging, to run in any other direction, than before the wind to the we&s;tward; and this

cour&s;e mu&s;t bring them to the continent, or i&s;lands of America.</P>
<P>In confirmation of this remark, &s;everal facts have been adduced by way of proof. One is thus relat|ed by Glas;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Introduction, page 5.</NOTE> "A few years ago, a &s;mall bark laden with corn and pa&s;&s;engers, bound from Lan|cerotta to Teneriffe, met with &s;ome di&s;a&s;ter at &s;ea, by which &s;he was rendered incapable of getting to any of the Canary i&s;lands; and was obliged to run many days before the wind, till &s;he came within two days &s;ail of the coa&s;t of Caraccas, in South America; where &s;he met an Engli&s;h &s;hip, which &s;upplied the &s;urviving pa&s;&s;engers with water, and directed her to the port of La Guiara, on that coa&s;t."

<P>Another fact is taken from Gumilla<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cited by Edwards, in his hi&s;tory of the W.

Their ema|ciated appearance would have &s;ufficiently confirm|ed the truth of their &s;tory, if the papers, which they produced, had not put the matter beyond all doubt."</P>
<P>A third fact is related by Herrera, the royal Spani&s;h hi&s;torian.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Decad. i, book ii, chap. 7.</NOTE> Columbus in his &s;econd voyage to America, having di&s;covered the i&s;land of Gua|daloupe, "found a piece of timber belonging to a &s;hip, which the &s;eamen call the &s;tern po&s;t; which they much admired, not knowing which way it &s;hould come thither, unle&s;s carried by tempe&s;tuous weather, from the Canaries, or from the i&s;land Hi&s;paniola," where the Admiral's &s;hip was ca&s;t a|way in his former voyage. Ferdinand Columbus, in the life of his father,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chapter 47, in Churchill's collections, vol. ii.</NOTE> does not directly a&s;&s;ert this; but &s;peaks of their finding "an iron pan;" and endeavours to account for it, by &s;aying that the &s;tones there being of the colour of iron, a per|&s;on of an indifferent judgment might mi&s;take the one for the other." Not content with this &s;olution he goes on thus; "though it were of iron, it was not to be admired, becau&s;e the Indians of the i&s;land of Guadaloupe, being Carribbees, and making their excur&s;ions to rob, as far as Hi&s;paniola; per|haps they had that pan, of the Chri&s;tians, or of the other Indians of Hi&s;paniola; and it is po&s;&s;ible they
<PB N="27" REF="026637_0025_0FD102D48ACFFD78">
might carry the <HI>body of the &s;hip</HI> the Admiral lo&s;t, to make u&s;e of the iron; and though it were not the <HI>hulk</HI> of that &s;hip; it might be the remainder of &s;ome other wreck, carried thither by the wind and cur|rent from our parts."</P>
<P>The improbability of the Indians having carried "the <HI>body</HI> or <HI>hulk</HI> of the &s;hip, which the Admiral lo&s;t," from the northern &s;ide of Hi&s;paniola, to the ea&s;tern &s;ide of Guadaloupe, will appear from the di&s;tance; which is not le&s;s than two hundred leagues, in a direction oppo&s;ite to the con&s;tant blow|ing of the wind. Nor will Herrera's conjecture, that the &s;tern po&s;t of the Admiral's &s;hip was carried thither by a tempe&s;t, be readily admitted, by any who are acquainted with the navigation of the We&s;t Indies; for it mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed through a multi|tude of i&s;lands and rocks; and, without a miracle, could &s;carcely have come entire, from &s;o great a di&s;tance in &s;uch foul &s;eas. But the difficulty is farther increa&s;ed, by con&s;idering what Don Ferdi|nand and Herrera have both a&s;&s;erted; that when Columbus had lo&s;t his &s;hip, "he built a fort with the timber, whereof he lo&s;t no part, but made u&s;e of it all;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, chap. xxxiv. Herrera, book i, chap. 18.</NOTE> and this fort was afterward burnt by the natives. If therefore there be any truth in the &s;tory of the &s;tern po&s;t found at Guadaloupe; it mu&s;t have belonged to &s;ome other ve&s;&s;el, either foundered at &s;ea, or wrecked on the &s;hore.</P>

The &s;ame winds which brought them hith|er, continuing to blow from the ea&s;tward, would either di&s;courage them from making the attempt, or oblige them to put back if they had made it. No argument then can be drawn from hence, in favour of a mutual intercour&s;e, between this and the old continent. Tho&s;e who would prove, that America was known to the ancients, mu&s;t produce better evi|dence, than they have yet produced, if they con|tend for any other knowledge, than what was acquir|ed by ca&s;ual di&s;coverers, who never returned.</P>
<P>The opinion that America was peopled, in part, by the Phenicians, was long &s;ince maintained by Hornius; and, though rejected by many &s;ucceed|ing writers, has been lately revived by Bryan Ed|wards,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

In &s;upport of this opinion, he has produced, perhaps, as much evidence from a &s;imilarity of manners and language, as a &s;ubject of &s;uch remote antiquity can admit.</P>

<P>THE ancient inhabitants of Norway and Denmark, collectively taken, were di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of NORMANS. Their &s;ituation near the coa&s;t of the &s;ea, and the ad|vantages which that element pre&s;ented to them beyond all which they could expect, from a rough &s;oil, in a cold climate, led them at an early period to the &s;cience and practice of navigation. They built their ve&s;&s;els with the be&s;t of oak, and con&s;tructed them in &s;uch a manner as to encounter the &s;torms and bil|lows of the northern ocean. They covered them with decks and furni&s;hed them with high foreca&s;tles and &s;terns. They made u&s;e of &s;ails as well as oars, and had learned to
<PB N="48" REF="026637_0046_0FD1031626622048">
trim their &s;ails to the wind, in almo&s;t any di|rection. In the&s;e arts, of building &s;hips and of navigation, they were &s;uperior to the peo|ple bordering on the Mediterranean &s;ea, who depended chiefly on their oars, and u&s;ed &s;ails only with a fair wind.</P>
<P>About the end of the eighth and beginning of the ninth century, the Normans made them&s;elves famous by their predatory excur|&s;ions. England, Scotland, Ireland, the Ork|ney and Shetland i&s;lands, were objects of their depredations; and, in one of their piratical expeditions, (A. D. 861) they di&s;covered an i&s;land, which from its lofty mountains, cov|ered with ice and &s;now, obtained the name of <HI>Iceland.</HI> In a few years after they planted a colony there, which was continually aug|mented by migrations from the neighbouring countries. Within the &s;pace of thirty years (889) a new country, &s;ituate on the we&s;t, was di&s;covered, and from its verdure during the &s;ummer months received the name of <HI>Greenland.</HI> This was deemed &s;o import|ant an acqui&s;ition, that, under the conduct of ERIC RAUDE, or REDHEAD, a Dani&s;h chief, it was &s;oon peopled.</P>
<P>The emigrants to the&s;e new regions were &s;till inflamed with the pa&s;&s;ion for adventure

and di&s;covery. An Icelander of the name HERIOLF and his &s;on BIRON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His name is &s;pelled by different authors BIRON, BIORN, BIOERN, and B<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">EN.</NOTE> made a voyage every year to different countries, for the &s;ake of traffic. About the beginning of the elev|enth century (1001) their &s;hips were &s;eparat|ed by a &s;torm. When Biron arrived in Nor|way, he heard that his father was gone to Greenland, and he re&s;olved to follow him; but another &s;torm drove him to the <HI>&s;outhwe&s;t,</HI> where he di&s;covered a flat country, free from rocks, but covered with thick woods; and an i&s;land near the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>He made no longer &s;tay at either of the&s;e places than till the &s;torm abated; when by a northea&s;t cour&s;e he ha&s;ted to Greenland. The di&s;covery was no &s;ooner known there, than LEIF the &s;on of Eric, who, like his father, had a &s;trong de&s;ire to acquire glory by adven|tures, equipped a ve&s;&s;el, carrying twenty five men; and, taking Biron for his pilot, &s;ailed (1002) in &s;earch of the new country.</P>
<P>His cour&s;e was &s;outhwe&s;t. On the fir&s;t land which he &s;aw, he found nothing but flat rocks and ice, without any verdure. He there|fore gave it the name of <HI>Helleland,</HI> which &s;ig|nifies
<PB N="50" REF="026637_0048_0FD1031A906EF090">
rocky. Afterward he came to a level &s;hore, without any rocks, but overgrown with woods, and the &s;and was remarkably white. This he named <HI>Markland,</HI> or woody. Two days after, he &s;aw land again, and an i&s;land ly|ing before the northern coa&s;t of it. Here he fir&s;t landed; and thence &s;ailing we&s;tward, round a point of land, found a creek or river into which the &s;hip entered.</P>
<P>On the banks of this river, were bu&s;hes bearing &s;weet berries; the air was mild, the &s;oil fertile, and the river well &s;tored with fi&s;h, among which were very fine &s;almon. At the head of this river was a lake, on the &s;hore of which they re&s;olved to pa&s;s the winter, and erected huts for their accommodation. One of their company, a German named Tyrker, having &s;traggled into the woods, found <HI>grapes</HI>; from which, he told them that in his country, they made <HI>wine.</HI> From this circum&s;tance Leif, the commander of the party, called the place <HI>Winland dat gode,</HI> the good wine country.</P>
<P>An intercour&s;e being thus opened between Greenland and Winland, &s;everal voyages were made, and the new country was further ex|plored. Many i&s;lands were found near the coa&s;t, but not a human creature was &s;een till

the third &s;ummer (1004) when three boats con&s;tructed with ribs of bone, fa&s;tened with thongs or twigs and covered with &s;kins, each boat containing three men, made their appear|ance. From the diminutive &s;ize of the&s;e people the Normans denominated them <HI>Skrae|lings,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cut &s;ticks, chips&mdash;Dwarfs.</NOTE> and inhumanly killed them all but one; who e&s;caped and collected a larger num|ber of his countrymen, to make an attack on their invaders. The Normans defended their &s;hips with &s;o much &s;pirit, that the a&s;&s;ailants were obliged to retire.</P>
<P>After this, a colony of Normans went and &s;ettled at Winland, carrying on a barter trade with the Skraelings for furs; but a controver|&s;y aro&s;e in the colony, which induced &s;ome to return to Greenland. The others di&s;per&s;ed and mixed with the Skraelings.</P>
<P>In the next century (1121) Eric, Bi&s;hop of Greenland, went to Winland, with a bene|volent de&s;ign to recover and convert his coun|trymen who had degenerated into &s;avages. This prelate never returned to Greenland; nor was any thing more heard of Winland, for &s;everal centuries.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="026637_0050_0FD1031EEFEF7430">This account of the di&s;covery of Winland is taken from Pontoppidan's hi&s;tory of Nor|way, Crantz's hi&s;tory of Greenland, and a late hi&s;tory of northern voyages by Dr. John Reinhold For&s;ter. The facts are &s;aid to have been collected from "a great number of Icelandic manu&s;cripts by Thormond Thor|foeus, Adam von Bremen, Arngrim Jonas and many other writers, &s;o that it is hardly po&s;&s;i|ble to entertain the lea&s;t doubt concerning the authenticity of the relation."</P>
<P>Pontoppidan &s;ays that "they could &s;ee the &s;un full &s;ix hours in the &s;horte&s;t day;" but Crantz tells us that "the &s;un ro&s;e on the &s;hort|e&s;t day at eight of the clock," and For&s;ter that "the &s;un was eight hours above the ho|rizon," from which he concludes, that Win|land mu&s;t be found in the 49th degree of northern latitude; and from its being in a &s;outhwe&s;terly direction from Greenland, he &s;uppo&s;es that it is either a part of Newfound|land or &s;ome place on the northern coa&s;t of the gulf of St. Lawrence; but whether grapes are found in either of tho&s;e countries he cannot &s;ay. However, he &s;eems &s;o fully per&s;uaded of the facts, that he gives it as his opinion, that the Normans were, &s;trictly &s;peaking, the

fir&s;t di&s;coverers of America, nearly five centu|ries before Columbus.</P>
<P>From a careful peru&s;al of the fir&s;t accounts of Newfoundland, pre&s;erved by tho&s;e painful collectors Hakluyt and Purchas, and of other memoirs re&s;pecting that i&s;land and the coa&s;t of Labrador; and from in&s;pecting the mo&s;t approved maps of tho&s;e regions, particularly one, in the American Atlas, delineated agreea|bly to the actual &s;urveys of the late celebrated navigator Capt. James Cook, the following ob&s;ervations occur.</P>
<P>On the N. E. part of Newfoundland, which is mo&s;t directly acce&s;&s;ible from Greenland, there is a long range of coa&s;t, in which are two bays, the one called Gander Bay, and the other the Bay of Exploits. Before the mouth of the former, among many &s;maller, there lies one large i&s;land called Fogo; and before the mouth of the latter, another, called The New World. Either of the&s;e will &s;ufficiently an|&s;wer to the &s;ituation de&s;cribed in the account of Biron's &s;econd voyage. Into each of the&s;e bays, runs a river, which has its head in a lake, and both the&s;e lakes lie in the 49th de|gree of north latitude.</P>
<P>The earlie&s;t accounts of Newfoundland after its di&s;covery and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a fi&s;hery

on its coa&s;ts, have re&s;pect chiefly to the lands about Trinity and Conception bays, between the parallels of 48&deg; and 49&deg;. The&s;e lands are repre&s;ented as producing &s;trawberries, whortle|berries, ra&s;pberries, goo&s;eberries, pears, wild cherries, and hazle nuts, in very great plenty. The rivers are &s;aid to have been well &s;tored with &s;almon and trouts. The natives, who inhabited a bay lying to the northward of Trinity and came occa&s;ionally thither in their canoes, are de&s;cribed as broad brea&s;ted and upright, with black eyes, and without beards; the hair on their heads was of dif|ferent colours; &s;ome had <HI>black,</HI> &s;ome <HI>brown</HI> and others <HI>yellow.</HI> In this variety they dif|fered from the other &s;avages of North Ame|rica, who have uniformly black hair, un|le&s;s it be grown grey with age.</P>
<P>The climate is repre&s;ented as more mild in the winter than that of England; but much colder in the &s;pring, by rea&s;on of the va&s;t i&s;lands of ice which are driven into the bays or grounded on the banks.</P>
<P>On the north ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Labrador, between the latitudes of 53&deg; and 56&deg;, are ma|ny excellent harbours and i&s;lands. The &s;eas are full of cod, the rivers abound with &s;almon;
<PB N="55" REF="026637_0053_0FD1032C51E8DAA8">
and the climate is &s;aid to be more mild than in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;aid in any of the&s;e accounts of vines or grapes, excepting that &s;ome which were brought from England had thriven well. If any evidence can be drawn from a compari|&s;on between the countries of Newfoundland and New-England it may be ob&s;erved; that all the above mentioned fruits and berries are found in the northern and ea&s;tern parts of New-England as far as Nova Scotia, in the latitudes of 44&deg; and 45&deg;; and that grapes, <HI>(vitis vulpina, vitis labru&s;ca)</HI> are known to grow wherever the&s;e fruits are found.</P>
<P>Du Monts in his voyage to Acadia, in 1608, &s;peaks of grapes in &s;everal places; and they were in &s;uch plenty on the i&s;le of Orleans in lat. 47&deg; that it was fir&s;t called the i&s;land of Bacchus.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is al&s;o &s;aid that Mr. Ellis met with the vine about the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements at Hud&s;on's Bay; and compares the fruit of it to the currants of the Levant.
<BIBL><HI>Mor&s;e's Un. Geo. vol. i, p.</HI> 64.</BIBL></NOTE> Though there is no direct and po&s;|itive te&s;timony of grapes in the i&s;land of New|foundland, it is by no means to be concluded that there were none. Nor is it improbable that grapes, though once found there, might have been &s;o &s;carce, as not to merit notice, in &s;uch general de&s;criptions, as were given by the fir&s;t Engli&s;h adventurers.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="026637_0054_0FD1032EB1D47070">The di&s;tance between Greenland and New|foundland is not greater than between Iceland and Norway; and there could be no more difficulty in navigating the we&s;tern than the ea&s;tern parts of the northern Ocean, with &s;uch ve&s;&s;els as were then in u&s;e, and by &s;uch &s;ea|men as the Normans are &s;aid to have been; though they knew nothing of the magnetic needle.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, though we can come to no po&s;itive conclu&s;ion in a que&s;tion of &s;uch remote antiquity; yet there are many cir|cum&s;tances to confirm, and none to di&s;prove the relation given of the voyages of Biron.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At my reque&s;t, Governor WENTWORTH, of Nova Scotia, has employed a proper per&s;on, to make inquiry into any ve&s;tiges of this ancient colony, which <HI>may</HI> yet be &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. I am &s;orry that the re&s;ult could not be had, before the publication of this volume; but when it comes to hand, it &s;hall be communicated.</NOTE> But if it be allowed that he is entitled to the honour of having di&s;covered America before Columbus, yet this di&s;covery cannot in the lea&s;t detract from the merit of that cele|brated navigator.

not, by the a&s;toni&s;hing exertions of his genius and his per&s;evering indu&s;try, effected a di&s;|covery of this continent, in a climate more friendly to the views of commercial adven|turers.</P>
<P>Even Greenland it&s;elf, in the fifteenth century, was known to the Danes and Nor|mans only by the name of <HI>lo&s;t</HI> Greenland; and they did not recover their knowledge of it, till after the Engli&s;h had a&s;certained its exi&s;tence by their voyages to di&s;cover a N.

<P>THIS per&s;on is &s;uppo&s;ed to have di&s;cov|ered America, and brought a colony of his countrymen hither, before the di&s;covery made by Columbus. The &s;tory of his emigration from Wales is thus related by Hakluyt, who&s;e book was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in 1589; and a &s;ec|ond edition of it in 1600.</P>
<P>"The voyage of Madoc, the &s;on of Owen Gwynneth, Prince of North Wales, to the We&s;t Indies in the year 1170; taken out of the hi&s;tory of Wales lately publi&s;hed by M. David Powel Doctor of Divinitie."</P>
<P>"After the death of Owen Gwynneth, his &s;ons fell at debate who &s;hould inherit after him. For the elde&s;t &s;on born in matrimony Edward or Iorweth Drwydion was counted unmeet to govern, becau&s;e of the maime upon his face; and Howel, that took upon him all the rule, was a ba&s;e &s;on begotten of an Iri&s;h woman. Therefore David gathered all the power he could and came again&s;t Howel, and fighting with him, &s;lew him; and afterward enjoyed quietly the whole land of North

Wales, until his brother Iorweth's &s;on came to age.</P>
<P>"MADOC, another of Owen Gwynneth his &s;ons left the land in contention between his brethren and prepared certain &s;hips with men and munition, and &s;ought adventures by &s;ea, &s;ailing <HI>we&s;t,</HI> and leaving the coa&s;t of Ireland &s;o far <HI>north</HI> that he came to a land unknown, where he &s;aw many &s;trange things.</P>
<P>"This land mu&s;t needs be &s;ome part of that country of which the Spaniards affirm them&s;elves to be the fir&s;t finders, &s;ince Han|no's time. [<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words included in crotchets [] are omitted in the &s;econd edition of Hakluyt's voyages.</NOTE> For by rea&s;on and order of co&s;|mographie, this land to the which Madoc came, mu&s;t needs be &s;ome part of Nova Hi&s;|pania or Florida.] Whereupon it is manife&s;t that that country was long [before] by Brit|tains di&s;covered, afore [either] Columbus [or Americus Ve&s;putius] led any Spaniards thither.</P>
<P>"Of the voyage and return of that Madoc there be many fables feigned, as the common people do u&s;e, in di&s;tance of place and length of time, rather to augment than dimini&s;h, but <HI>&s;ure it is that there he was.</HI> And after he had returned home and declared the plea&s;ant and
<PB N="60" REF="026637_0058_0FD103386FA27158">
fruitful countries that he had &s;een <HI>without in|habitants</HI>; and upon the contrary part, for what wild and barren ground his brethren and nephews did murther one another, he prepar|ed a number of &s;hips and got with him &s;uch men and women as were de&s;irous to live in quietne&s;s; and taking leave of his friends, took his journey thitherwards again.</P>
<P>"Therefore it is to be pre&s;uppo&s;ed, that he and his people inhabited part of tho&s;e coun|tries; for it appeareth, by Francis Lopez de Gomara, that in Acuzamil, and other places, the people honoured the cro&s;s. Whereby it may be gathered, that Chri&s;tians had been there before the coming of the Spaniards. But becau&s;e this people were not many, they followed the <HI>manners</HI> of the land they came to, and u&s;ed the <HI>language</HI> they found there.</P>
<P>"This Madoc arriving in that we&s;tern country unto the which he came in the year 1170, left mo&s;t of his people there, and re|turning back for more of his own nation, ac|quaintance and friends, to inhabit that fair and large country, went thither again, with ten &s;ails, as I find noted by Gutyn Owen.

<P>In this extract from Hakluyt is contained all the original information which I have been able to find re&s;pecting the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;covery of America by the Welch. The account it&s;elf is confu&s;ed and contradictory. The country di&s;covered by Madoc is &s;aid to be "without inhabitants;" and yet the people whom he carried thither "followed the man|ners of the land, and u&s;ed the language they found there." Though the Welch emigrants lo&s;t their language, yet the author attempts to prove the truth of his &s;tory by the pre&s;erva|tion of &s;everal Welch words in the American tongues. Among the&s;e he is unfortunate in
<PB N="63" REF="026637_0061_0FD103400A7B49E0">
the choice of "<HI>penguin</HI> a bird with a <HI>white head</HI>;" all the birds of that name on the American &s;hores having black or dark brown heads, and the name <HI>penguin</HI> is &s;aid to have been originally <HI>pinguedine,</HI> from their exce&s;&s;ive fatne&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the new Encyclopedia, under the article AMERICA.</NOTE></P>
<P>Among the proofs which &s;ome late writers have adduced in &s;upport of the di&s;covery of America by Madoc is this, that a language re&s;embling the Welch was &s;poken by a tribe of Indians in North-Carolina, and that it is &s;till u&s;ed by a nation &s;ituate on &s;ome of the we&s;tern waters of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. If that part of the account pre&s;erved by Hakluyt be true, that the language was lo&s;t, it is vain to offer an argument of this kind in &s;upport of the truth of the &s;tory; but a que&s;tion may here ari&s;e, How could any report of the lo&s;s of their language have been tran&s;mitted to Europe at &s;o early a period?</P>
<P>An attempt has lately been made to a&s;cer|tain the truth of this piece of hi&s;tory by Dr. John Williams. I have not &s;een the book it&s;elf, but if the Critical Reviewers may be credited,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Critical Review for 1791, page 357.</NOTE> no new facts have been adduced.
<PB N="64" REF="026637_0062_0FD103400E1D24D8">
It is remarked by them, that "if Madoc <HI>once</HI> reached America, it is difficult to explain how he could return home, and it would be more improbable that he &s;hould arrive in America a <HI>&s;econd</HI> time; of which there is not the &s;lighte&s;t evidence." They al&s;o ob&s;erve, that "if Madoc &s;ailed we&s;tward from Wales, the currents would rather have carried him to Nova Scotia than to the &s;outhward."</P>
<P>The mentioning of Nova Scotia reminds me of &s;ome words in the native language of that country which begin with two &s;yllables re&s;embling the name of Madoc.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gyles memoirs of his Captivity in 1689.</NOTE> A &s;achem of the Penob&s;cot tribe who lived in the end of the la&s;t and in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century bore the name of <HI>Madokawando.</HI> A village on Penob&s;cot river was called <HI>Mada|wankee.</HI> One branch of the river St. John which runs into the bay of Funda is <HI>Medoc|tack</HI> and another is <HI>Medoc&s;ceneca&s;is.</HI> The ad|vocates of this opinion may avail them&s;elves as far as they can of this coincidence, but in my apprehen&s;ion it is too precarious to be the ba&s;is of any ju&s;t conclu&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>III. ZENO.</HEAD>
<P>IT is well known that the Venetians were reckoned among the mo&s;t expert and ad|venturous of the maritime nations. In that re|public, the family of ZENO or ZENI is not only very ancient, and of high rank; but celebrated for illu&s;trious achievements. Nicolo Zeno, having exhibited great valour in a war with the Genoe&s;e, conceived an ardent de&s;ire, agreeably to the genius of his nation, to trav|el; that he might, by his acquaintance with foreign nations and languages, render him&s;elf more illu&s;trious and more u&s;eful. With this view he equipped a ve&s;&s;el at his own expen&s;e, and &s;ailed through the &s;traits of Gibraltar to the northward, [A. D. 1380] with an in|tention to vi&s;it Britain and Flanders; but by a &s;torm which la&s;ted many days, he was ca&s;t away on the coa&s;t of <HI>Fri&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince of the country Zichmni (or as Purchas &s;pells it Zichmui) finding Zeno an expert &s;eaman, gave him the command of his fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of thirteen ve&s;&s;els, of which two only were rowed with oars; one was a &s;hip, and the re&s;t were &s;mall barks. With
<PB N="68" REF="026637_0066_0FD10348900F6B70">
this fleet, he made conque&s;ts and depredations in Ledovo and Ilofo and other &s;mall i&s;lands; &s;everal barks laden with fi&s;h being a part of his capture.</P>
<P>Nicolo wrote to his brother Antonio Zeno at Venice, inviting him to Fri&s;land, whither he went, and being taken into the &s;ervice of Zichmni, continued with him fourteen years. The fleet &s;ailed on an expedition to <HI>E&s;tland,</HI> where they committed great ravages; but hear|ing that the King of Norway was coming again&s;t them with a &s;uperior fleet, they departed; and were driven by a &s;torm on &s;hoals, where part of the fleet was wrecked, and the re&s;t were &s;av|ed on <HI>Gri&s;land,</HI> "a great i&s;land but not inhab|ited."</P>
<P>Zichmni then determined to attack Iceland, which belonged to the King of Norway; but finding it well fortified and defended, and his fleet being dimini&s;hed, he retired and built a fort in <HI>Bre&s;s,</HI> one of &s;even &s;mall i&s;lands, where he left Nicolo and returned to Fri&s;land.</P>
<P>In the next &s;pring Zeno, with three &s;mall barks, &s;ailed to the northward on di&s;covery, and arrived at <HI>Engroenland</HI>; where he found a mona&s;tery of Friars, and a Church dedicated to St. Thomas, &s;ituate near a volcano, and
<PB N="69" REF="026637_0067_0FD1034AB6F52720">
heated by warm &s;prings flowing from the mountain.</P>
<P>After the death of Nicolo, which happen|ed in about four years, Antonio &s;ucceeded him in the command of the fleet; and the prince Zichmni, aiming at the &s;overeignty of the &s;ea, undertoook an expedition <HI>we&s;tward,</HI> be|cau&s;e that &s;ome fi&s;hermen had di&s;covered rich and populous i&s;lands in that quarter.</P>
<P>The report of the fi&s;hermen was, that above a thou&s;and miles we&s;tward from Fri&s;land, to which di&s;tance they had been driven by a tem|pe&s;t, there was an i&s;land call <HI>E&s;totiland,</HI> which they had di&s;covered twenty &s;ix years before; that &s;ix men in one boat were driven upon the i&s;land, and being taken by the inhabitants were brought into a fair and populous city; that the King of the place &s;ent for many in|terpreters, but none was found who could under&s;tand the language of the fi&s;hermen, ex|cept one who could &s;peak Latin, and he had formerly been ca&s;t a&s;hore on the i&s;land; that on his reporting their ca&s;e to the King, he detained them five years, in which time they learned the language; that one of them vi&s;ited divers parts of the i&s;land, and reported, that it was a very rich country,
<PB N="70" REF="026637_0068_0FD1034DDD88C698">
abounding with all the commodities of the world; that it was le&s;s than Iceland, but far more fruitful, having in the middle a very high mountain, from which originated four rivers.</P>
<P>The inhabitants were de&s;cribed as very in|genious, having all mechanic arts. They had a peculiar kind of language and letters; and in the King's library were pre&s;erved Latin books, which they did not under&s;tand. They had all kinds of metals (but e&s;pecially gold, with which they mightily abounded.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This pa&s;&s;age is in Hakluyt's tran&s;lation and the abridgment by Ortelius; but Dr. For&s;ter could not find it in the Italian original <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.

They had many great fore&s;ts, which &s;upplied them with timber for the building of &s;hips, hou&s;es and fortifications. The u&s;e of the load&s;tone was not known; but the&s;e fi&s;hermen having the mariner's compa&s;s, were held in &s;o high e&s;timation, that the King &s;ent them with twelve barks to a country at the &s;outhward, called <HI>Drogio</HI>; where the mo&s;t of them were killed and devoured by cannibals; but one of them &s;aved him&s;elf by &s;howing the &s;avages a way of tak|ing
<PB N="71" REF="026637_0069_0FD1034DE384C9E8">
fi&s;h by nets, in much greater plenty than by any other mode before known among them. This fi&s;herman was in &s;o great demand with the princes of the country, that they frequently made war on each other for the &s;ake of gaining him. In this manner he pa&s;&s;|ed from one to another, till in the &s;pace of thirteen years, he had lived with twenty five different princes; to whom he communicated his "miraculous" art of fi&s;hing with nets.</P>
<P>He thus became acquainted with every part of the country, which he de&s;cribed to be &s;o exten&s;ive as to merit the name of a <HI>new world.</HI> The people were rude and ignorant of the u&s;e of clothing, though their climate was cold, and afforded bea&s;ts for the chace. In their hunting and wars they u&s;ed the bow and the lance; but they knew not the u&s;e of metal.</P>
<P>Farther to the &s;outhwe&s;t the air was &s;aid to be more temperate and the people more civil. They dwelt in cities, built temples, and wor&s;hipped idols to whom they offered human victims; and they had plenty of gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>The fi&s;herman having become fully ac|quainted with the country meditated a return. Having fled through the woods to Drogio,
<PB N="72" REF="026637_0070_0FD10350F84F3CC8">
after three years &s;ome boats arrived from E&s;|totiland in one of which he embarked for that country; and having acquired con&s;idera|ble property he fitted out a bark of his own and returned to Fri&s;land.</P>
<P>Such was the report of the fi&s;herman; up|on hearing of which Zichmni re&s;olved to equip his fleet and go in &s;earch of the new country; Antonio Zeno being the &s;econd in command. But "the preparation for the voyage to E&s;totiland was begun in an evil hour; the fi&s;herman who was to have been the pilot died three days before their depar|ture."</P>
<P>However, taking certain mariners who had &s;ailed with the fi&s;herman, Zichmni began the intended voyage. When he had &s;ailed a &s;mall di&s;tance to the we&s;tward, he was overtaken by a &s;torm which la&s;ted eight days, at the end of which they di&s;covered land, which the natives called <HI>Icaria.</HI> They were numerous and for|midable and would not permit him to come on &s;hore. From this place they &s;ailed &s;ix days to the we&s;tward with a fair wind; but a heavy gale from the &s;outhward drove them four days before it, when they di&s;covered land, in which was a volcano. The air was mild and temperate, it being the height of &s;ummer.
<PB N="73" REF="026637_0071_0FD103534717A898">
They took a great quantity of fi&s;h, of &s;ea fowl and their eggs. A party who penetrated the country as far as the foot of the volcano, found a &s;pring, from which i&s;&s;ued "a certain water, like pitch, which ran into the &s;ea." They di&s;covered &s;ome of the inhabitants who were of &s;mall &s;tature and wild; and who, at the approach of the &s;trangers, hid them&s;elves in their caves. Having found a good harbour; Zichmni intended to make a &s;ettlement; but his people oppo&s;ing it, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed part of the fleet under Zeno who returned to Fri&s;land.</P>
<P>The particulars of this narrative were fir&s;t written by Antonio Zeno, in letters to his brother Carlo, at Venice; from &s;ome fragments of which, a compilation was made by Fran|ci&s;co Marcolini, and pre&s;erved by Ramu&s;io. It was tran&s;lated by Richard Hakluyt, and printed in the third volume of the &s;econd edition of his collections, page 121, &amp;c. From it Ortelius has made an extract in his <HI>Theatrum orbis.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. For&s;ter has taken much pains to exam|ine the whole account, both geographically and hi&s;torically. The re&s;ult of his inquiry is, that Fri&s;land is one of the Orkneys; that Porland is the clu&s;ter of i&s;lands called Faro; and that E&s;tland is Shetland.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="026637_0072_0FD1035571EC9038">At fir&s;t indeed he was of opinion that "the countries de&s;cribed by the Zenos actually ex|i&s;ted at that time, but had &s;ince been &s;wal|lowed up by the &s;ea, in a great earthquake."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Northern voyages, Dublin edition, p. 200.</NOTE> This opinion he founded on the probability that all the high i&s;lands in the middle of the &s;ea are of volcanic original; as is evident with re&s;pect to Iceland and the Faro i&s;lands in the North Sea; the Azores, Teneriffe, Madeira, the Cape de Verds, St. Helena and A&s;cen&s;ion in the Atlantic; the Society I&s;lands, Otaheite, Ea&s;ter, the Marque&s;as, and other i&s;lands in the Pacific. This opinion he was induced to relinqui&s;h, partly becau&s;e "&s;o great a re|volution mu&s;t have left behind it &s;ome hi&s;to|rical ve&s;tiges or traditions;" but, principally, becau&s;e his knowledge of the Runic language &s;ugge&s;ted to him a re&s;emblance between the names mentioned by Zeno and tho&s;e which are given to &s;ome of the i&s;lands of Orkney, Shetland, Faro and the Hebrides.</P>
<P>However pre&s;umptuous it may appear to call in que&s;tion the opinion of &s;o learned and diligent an inquirer, on a &s;ubject, which his philological and geographical knowledge

mu&s;t enable him to examine with the greate&s;t preci&s;ion; yet, from the &s;earch which I have had opportunity to make, it appears probable to me that his fir&s;t opinion was right, as far as it re&s;pects Fri&s;land, and perhaps Porland. My rea&s;ons are the&s;e:</P>
<P N="1">1. Dr. For&s;ter &s;ays that Fri&s;land was "much larger than Iceland;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 181.</NOTE> and Hakluyt, in his account of Zeno's voyage, &s;peaks of it as "bigger than Ireland."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. iii, p. 122.</NOTE> Neither of the&s;e accounts can agree with the &s;uppo&s;ition of its being one of the Orkneys; for Iceland is 346 miles long and 200 wide. Ireland is 310 in length, and 184 in breadth; but Pomona, the mainland of the Orkneys, is but 22 miles long and 20 wide.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. One of the rea&s;ons which led the Doctor to give up his fir&s;t opinion, that the&s;e lands once exi&s;ted, but had di&s;appeared, was, that &s;o great a revolution mu&s;t have left &s;ome ve&s;tige behind. If no per&s;on e&s;caped to tell the news, what better ve&s;tige can there be, than the exi&s;tence of &s;hoals or rocks, in the places where the&s;e i&s;lands once were known to be? In a map prefixed to Crantz's hi&s;tory of Green|land, there is marked a very exten&s;ive &s;hoal between the latitudes of 59&deg; and 60&deg;, called "The &s;unken land of Bu&s;s." Its longitude is between Iceland and Greenland, and the author &s;peaks of it in the&s;e words, "Some are of opinion that Fri&s;land was &s;unk by an earth|quake; and that it was &s;ituate in tho&s;e parts where the &s;unken land of Bu&s;s is marked in the maps; which the &s;eamen cautiou&s;ly a|void, becau&s;e of the &s;hallow ground and tur|bulent waves."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i, p. 273.</NOTE></P>

<P>In a map of the North Seas prefixed to an anonymous account of Greenland, in Church|ill's Collection<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii, p. 378.</NOTE> we find Fri&s;land laid down in the latitude 62, between Iceland and Greenland.</P>
<P>We have then no rea&s;on to doubt the exi&s;|tence of the&s;e i&s;lands as late as the beginning of the la&s;t century; at what time they di&s;|appeared is uncertain, but that their place has &s;ince been occupied by a &s;hoal, we have al&s;o credible te&s;timony.</P>

<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons incline me to believe that Dr. For&s;ter's fir&s;t opinion was well founded, as far as it re&s;pects Fri&s;land.</P>
<P>He &s;uppo&s;es Porland to be the clu&s;ter of i&s;lands called Faro<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Northern Voyages, p. 207.</NOTE>.

The learned Doctor, who is in general very accurate, was not aware of this incon&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>In the account which Hakluyt has given of Martin Frobi&s;her's third voyage, we find that one of his &s;hips, the Bu&s;s of Bridgewater, in her return fell in with land, 50 leagues S. E. of Fri&s;land "which (it is &s;aid) was never found before" the &s;outhernmo&s;t part of which lay in latitude 57&deg;&frac12;. Along the coa&s;t of this land, which they judged to extend 25 leagues, they &s;ailed for three days.<NOTE PLACE="foot">Hakluyt, vol. iii. p. 77, 93.</NOTE> The exi&s;tence of

this land, Dr. For&s;ter &s;eems to doubt; but yet allows that "if it was then really di&s;covered it mu&s;t have &s;unk afterwards into the &s;ea, as it has never been &s;een again; or el&s;e the&s;e navigators mu&s;t have been mi&s;taken in their reckoning."</P>
<P>If &s;uch an i&s;land or clu&s;ter of i&s;lands did exi&s;t in the &s;ituation de&s;cribed by Frobi&s;her, it might be the Porland of Zeno; for the &s;outhernmo&s;t part of Fri&s;land lay in the lat|itude of 60&deg;&frac12;; the &s;outhernmo&s;t part of this land in 57&deg;&frac12; in a direction S.

W. N. W. wind W. S. W. At 4 A. M. di&s;covered a large rock a head, which for &s;ome time we took to be a &s;hip under clo&s;e reefed top&s;ail. At 7, being within two miles, &s;aw breakers under our lee, on which account wore &s;hip. There are breakers in two places bearing S. E; one a mile, the other two miles from the rock. It lies in lat. 57&deg; 38&prime;; lon|gitude We&s;t from London 13&deg; 36&prime;; and may be di&s;covered five leagues off. We &s;ounded and had 56 fathom. The rock appears to be about 100 yards in circumference and 50 feet above water. It makes like a hay &s;tack, black be|low and white on the top." The other is Nathaniel Goodwin, of Bo&s;ton, who, in his homeward pa&s;&s;age from Am&s;terdam, on the 15th of Augu&s;t 1793, &s;aw the &s;ame rock. According to his ob&s;ervation, (which however on that day was a little dubious) it lies in lat. 57&deg; 48&prime; and lon. 13&deg; 46&prime;. He pa&s;&s;ed within two miles of it to the &s;outhward and &s;aw breakers to the northward of it. Its appear|ance he de&s;cribes in the &s;ame manner with Smith.</P>
<P>From the&s;e authorities I am &s;trongly in|clined to believe that the &s;hoal denominat|ed "the &s;unken land of Bu&s;s" is either a
<PB N="83" REF="026637_0081_0FD1036A45BA0C98">
part of the ancient Fri&s;land or of &s;ome i&s;land in its neighbourhood; and that the rock and ledges &s;een by Smith and Goodwin, belonged to the clu&s;ter once called Porland. If the&s;e conclu&s;ions be admitted, there can be no &s;u&s;|picion of fiction in the &s;tory of Zeno, as far as it re&s;pects Prince Zichmni, and his expedi|tions. Shetland may then well enough agree with E&s;tland, which is de&s;cribed by Hakluyt as lying "between Fri&s;land and Norway."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. iii, p. 122.</NOTE></P>
<P>The only place which in Zeno's relation is called by the &s;ame name, by which it is now known, is Iceland; though there can be no doubt that Engroenland, or Engroveland, is the &s;ame with Greenland; where, according to Crantz, there was once a church dedicated to St. Thomas, and &s;ituate near a volcano and a hot &s;pring.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Crantz's hi&s;t. of Greenland, vol. ii, p. 26<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>But the que&s;tion is, where &s;hall we find E&s;totiland? Dr. For&s;ter is po&s;itive that "it cannot be any other country, than Winland (di&s;covered in 1001) where the Normans made a &s;ettlement." The Latin books &s;een there by the fi&s;herman, he &s;uppo&s;es to have been the library of Eric, Bi&s;hop of Greenland, who went thither in the twelfth century to
<PB N="84" REF="026637_0082_0FD1036B891E88A0">
convert his countrymen. He is al&s;o of opi|nion that this fi&s;herman had the u&s;e of the magnetic needle which began to be known in Europe about the year 1302, before the time of the Zenos. He al&s;o thinks that the country called Drogio is the &s;ame with Florida.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the old maps, particularly in San&s;on's French Atlas, the name E&s;totiland is marked on the country of Labrador; but the pompous de&s;cription of it by the fi&s;her|man, whether it be Labrador or Newfound|land, exceeds all the bounds of credibility, and abu&s;es even the licence of a traveller. The utmo&s;t extent of Zichmni's expedition, in con&s;equence of the fi&s;herman's report, could not be any farther we&s;tward than Greenland, to which his de&s;cription well agrees. The original inhabitants were &s;hort of &s;tature, half wild and lived in caverns; and between the years 1380 and 1384 they had extirpated the Normans and the monks of St. Thomas.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery of E&s;totiland mu&s;t therefore re&s;t on the report of the fi&s;herman; but the de&s;cription of it, of Drogio, and the Coun|try S. W. of Drogio mu&s;t be ranked in the fabulous hi&s;tory of America; and would pro|bably

<P>THE adventures which have been al|ready &s;poken of were more the re&s;ult of acci|dent than de&s;ign; we are now entering on one, founded in &s;cience and conducted by judg|ment; an adventure, which whether we re|gard its conception, its execution, or its con|&s;equences, will always reflect the highe&s;t hon|our on him, who projected it.</P>
<P>About the middle of the fifteenth century, when the Portugue&s;e under the conduct of Prince Henry, and afterward of King John II. were pu&s;hing their di&s;coveries along the we&s;|tern &s;hore of Africa, to find a pa&s;&s;age by the &s;outh to India; a genius aro&s;e, who&s;e memory has been pre&s;erved with veneration in the pages of hi&s;tory, as the in&s;trument of enlarging the region of &s;cience and commerce, beyond any of his predece&s;&s;ors. CHRISTOPHER CO|LUMBUS, a native of the Republic of Genoa, was born in the year 1447, and at the age of fourteen entered on a &s;eafaring life, as the proper &s;phere, in which his vigorous mind was de&s;tined to perform exploits which

<BIBL>Herrera's Hi&s;t. Amer. vol. i.</BIBL></NOTE> He was educated in the &s;ciences of Geometry and A&s;tronomy, which form the ba&s;is of navigation; and he was well ver&s;ed in Co&s;mography, Hi&s;tory and Philo&s;ophy. His active and enterpri&s;ing ge|nius, though it enabled him to comprehend the old &s;y&s;tems, yet would not &s;uffer him to re&s;t in their deci&s;ions, however &s;anctified by time or by venerable names; but determined to examine them by actual experiment, he fir&s;t vi&s;ited the &s;eas within the polar circle, and afterward tho&s;e parts of Africa, which the Portugue&s;e had di&s;covered, as far as the coa&s;t of Guinea; and by the time that he had at|tained the age of thirty &s;even, he had from his own experience received the fulle&s;t con|viction, that the opinion of the ancients re&s;pecting the torrid and frigid zones was void of any ju&s;t foundation.</P>
<P>When an old &s;y&s;tem is found erroneous in one point, it is natural to &s;u&s;pect it of farther imperfections; and when one difficulty is overcome, others appear le&s;s formidable. Such was the ca&s;e with Columbus; and his views were accelerated by an incident, which threat|ened
<PB N="88" REF="026637_0086_0FD0F971632E1E68">
to put an end to his life. During one of his voyages, the &s;hip in which he &s;ailed took fire, in an engagement with a Venetian galley, and the crew were obliged to leap into the &s;ea, to avoid peri&s;hing in the flames. In this extremity, Columbus, by the help of a floating oar, &s;wam upwards of two leagues to the coa&s;t of Portugal near Li&s;bon, and met with a welcome reception from many of his countrymen who were &s;ettled there.</P>
<P>At Li&s;bon, he married the daughter of Pere&s;trello, an old &s;eaman, who had been con|cerned in the di&s;covery of Porto Santo and Madeira; from who&s;e journals and charts, he received the highe&s;t entertainment. Pur|&s;uing his inquiries in Geography, and ob&s;erv|ing what &s;low progre&s;s the Portugue&s;e made in their attempts to find a way round Africa to India, "he began to reflect that as the Portugue&s;e travelled &s;o far &s;outhward, it were no le&s;s proper to &s;ail we&s;tward," and that it was rea&s;onable to expect to find the de&s;ired land in that direction.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t here be remembered, that India was in part known to the ancients, and that its rich and u&s;eful productions had for many centuries been conveyed into Europe, either
<PB N="89" REF="026637_0087_0FD10373D3955228">
by caravans through the de&s;arts of Syria and Arabia; or by the way of the Red Sea, through Egypt, into the Mediterranean.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robert&s;on's India. Bruce's Travels.</NOTE> This lucrative commerce had been &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly engro&s;&s;ed by the Phenicians, the Hebrews, the Egyptians, the A&s;&s;yrians, the Palmyrenes, the Arabians, the Genoe&s;e and the Venetians. The Portugue&s;e were then &s;eeking it by at|tempting the circumnavigation of Africa; and their expectation of finding it in that di|rection was grounded on ancient hi&s;torical traditions, that a voyage had been formerly made by the orders of Necho King of Egypt, from the Red Sea, round the &s;outhern part of Africa to the &s;traits of Hercules; and that the &s;ame route had been traver&s;ed by Hanno the Carthaginian, by Eudoxus the Egyptian, and others. The Portugue&s;e had con&s;umed about half a century in making va|rious attemps, and had advanced no farther, on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa, than ju&s;t to cro&s;s the Equator, when Columbus conceived his great de&s;ign of finding India in the we&s;t.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es which led him to entertain this idea are di&s;tingui&s;hed by his &s;on, the writer of his life, into the&s;e three; "natural rea&s;on,
<PB N="90" REF="026637_0088_0FD10375BAD6A328">
the authority of writers, and the te&s;timony of &s;ailors."</P>
<P>By the help of "rea&s;on," he argued in this manner: That the earth and &s;ea compo&s;ed one globe or &s;phere. This was known by ob&s;erving the &s;hadow of the earth in lunar eclip&s;es. Hence he concluded that it might be travelled over from ea&s;t to we&s;t, or from we&s;t to ea&s;t. It had been explored to the ea&s;t by &s;ome European travellers as far as Cipango, or Japan; and as far we&s;tward as the Azores or We&s;tern I&s;lands. The remaining &s;pace, though now known to be more than half, he &s;uppo&s;ed to be but one third part of the cir|cumference of the globe. If this &s;pace were an open &s;ea, he imagined it might be ea&s;ily &s;ailed over; and if there were any land extend|ing ea&s;twardly beyond the known limits of A&s;ia, he &s;uppo&s;ed that it mu&s;t be nearer to Spain by the we&s;t, than by the ea&s;t. For, it was then a received opinion that the conti|nent and i&s;lands of India extended over one third part of the circumference of the globe; that another third part was comprehended between India and the we&s;tern &s;hore of Spain; therefore it was concluded, that the ea&s;tern part of India mu&s;t be as near to Spain
<PB N="91" REF="026637_0089_0FD103781FCBA9E8">
as the we&s;tern part. This opinion though now known to be erroneous, yet being then admitted as true, made it appear to Columbus very ea&s;y and practicable to di&s;cover India in the we&s;t. He hoped al&s;o that between Spain and India, in that direction, there might be found &s;ome i&s;lands; by the help of which, as re&s;ting places in his voyage, he might the better pur&s;ue his main de&s;ign. The probabil|ity of the exi&s;tence of land in that Ocean, he argued, partly from the opinion of philo&s;o|phers, that there was more land than &s;ea on the &s;urface of the globe; and partly from the nece&s;&s;ity of a counterpoi&s;e in the we&s;t, for the immen&s;e quantity of land which was known to be in the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Another &s;ource, from which he drew his conclu&s;ion, was, "the authority of learned men," who had affirmed the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ailing from the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Spain, to the ea&s;tern bounds of India. Some of the ancient Geographers had admitted this for truth, and one of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny.</NOTE> had affirmed that forty days were &s;ufficient to perform this navigation. The&s;e authorities fell in with the theory which Columbus had formed; and having, as early as 1474, communicated his ideas in
<PB N="92" REF="026637_0090_0FD1037A8D5AC320">
writing, to Paul a learned phy&s;ician of Flo|rence, he received from him letters of that date, confirming his opinion and encouraging his de&s;ign; accompanied with a chart, in which Paul had laid down the city of Qui&s;ay (&s;up|po&s;ed to be the capital of China) but little more than two thou&s;and leagues we&s;tward from Li&s;bon, which in fact is but half the di&s;tance. Thus, by arguing from true prin|ciples, and by indulging conjectures partly well founded and partly erroneous, Columbus was led to the execution of a plan, bold in its conception, and, to his view, ea&s;ily practicable; for great minds overlook intermediate ob&s;ta|cles, which men of &s;maller views magnify into in&s;uperable difficulties.</P>
<P>The third ground on which he formed his idea was "the te&s;timony of mariners;" a cla&s;s of men who at that time, and in that imper|fect &s;tate of &s;cience, were too prone to mix fable with fact; and were often mi&s;led by appearances, which they could not &s;olve. In the &s;ea, between Madcira and the We&s;tern I&s;lands, pieces of carved wood and large joints of cane had been di&s;covered, which were &s;up|po&s;ed to be brought by we&s;terly winds. Branch|es of pine trees, a covered canoe, and two hu|man
<PB N="93" REF="026637_0091_0FD1037C8CCC1B98">
bodies of a complexion different from the Europeans and Africans had been found on the &s;hores of the&s;e i&s;lands. Some navigators had affirmed, that they had &s;een i&s;lands not more than an hundred leagues we&s;tward from the Azores. There was a tradition, that when Spain was conquered by the Moors in the eighth century, &s;even Bi&s;hops, who were exiled from their country, had built &s;even cities and churches, on an i&s;land called An|tilla; which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be not more than two hundred leagues we&s;t of the Canaries; and it was &s;aid that a Portugue&s;e &s;hip had once di&s;covered this i&s;land, but could never find it again. The&s;e &s;tories, partly true and partly fabulous, had their effect on the mind of Columbus. He believed that i&s;lands were were to be found, we&s;tward of the Azores and Canaries; though according to his theory, they were at a greater di&s;tance than any of his contemporaries had imagined. His candour led him to adopt an opinion from Pliny re&s;|pecting floating i&s;lands, by the help of which he accounted for the appearances related to him, by his marine brethren. It is not im|probable that the large i&s;lands of floating ice, driven from the Polar Seas to the &s;outhward;

Henry, till Chri&s;topher Columbus had &s;uc|ceeded in Spain. Before this could be ac|compli&s;hed, he had various ob&s;tacles to &s;ur|mount; and it was not till after &s;even years of painful &s;olicitation that he obtained his re|que&s;t.</P>
<P>The objections made to the propo&s;al of Columbus, by the mo&s;t learned men in Spain, to whom the con&s;ideration of it was referred, will give us &s;ome idea of the &s;tate of geogra|phical &s;cience at that time. One objection was, How &s;hould he know more than all the wi&s;e men and &s;kilful &s;ailors who had exi&s;ted &s;ince the creation? Another was the authori|ty of Seneca, who had doubted whether it were po&s;&s;ible to navigate the ocean at any great di&s;tance from the &s;hore; but admitting that it were navigable, they imagined, that three years would be required to perform the voyage, which Columbus propo&s;ed. A third was, that if a &s;hip &s;hould &s;ail we&s;tward on a round globe, &s;he would nece&s;&s;arily go down, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and then it would be impo&s;&s;ible to return, becau&s;e it would be like climbing up a hill, which no &s;hip could do with the &s;tronge&s;t wind. A fourth objection was grounded on a book of St. Augu&s;tine,
<PB N="98" REF="026637_0096_0FD10387515CF628">
in which he had expre&s;&s;ed his doubt of the exi&s;tence of antipodes and the po&s;&s;ibility of going from one hemi&s;phere to the other. As the writings of this Holy Father had received the &s;anction of the Church, to contradict him was deemed here&s;y.</P>
<P>For &s;uch rea&s;ons, and by &s;uch rea&s;oners, the propo&s;al of Columbus was at fir&s;t rejected; but by the influence of John Perez, a Spani&s;h Prie&s;t, and Lewis Santangel, an officer of the King's hou&s;hold, Queen I&s;abella was per&s;uad|ed to li&s;ten to his &s;olicitation, and after he had been twice repul&s;ed, to recal him to Court; when &s;he offered to pawn her jewels to defray the expen&s;e of the equipment, amount|ing to no more than 2500 crowns; which &s;um was advanced by Santangel, and the Queen's jewels were &s;aved. Thus, to the generous deci&s;ion of a female mind, we owe the di&s;covery of America.</P>
<P>The conditions &s;tipulated between Ferdi|nand and I&s;abella on the one part, and Co|lumbus on the other part, were the&s;e: "That he, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;hould hold the office of Admiral in all tho&s;e <HI>I&s;lands and Con|tinents</HI> which he &s;hould di&s;cover; that he &s;hould be Viceroy and Governor of the &s;ame&punc;

Having pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;traits of Gibraltar, he arrived at the Canaries, on the 12th of the &s;ame month; where he was detained in refitting one of the caravels, and taking in wood and water, till the 6th of September, when he &s;ailed we&s;t|ward on his voyage of di&s;covery.</P>
<P>This voyage, which now is con&s;idered as an ea&s;y and plea&s;ant run, between the latitudes
<PB N="100" REF="026637_0098_0FD104758C788910">
of 20 and 30 degrees, with a trade wind, was then the bolde&s;t attempt which had ever been made, and filled the minds of the be&s;t &s;eamen with apprehen&s;ion. They were going direct|ly from home, and from all hope of relief, if any accident &s;hould befal them. No friendly port nor human being was known to be in that direction. Every bird which flew in the air, every fi&s;h which appeared in the &s;ea, and every weed which floated on its &s;urface, was regarded with the mo&s;t minute attention, as if the fate of the voyage depended on it. A phenomenon which had never before been ob&s;erved &s;truck them with terror. The mag|netic needle appeared to vary from the pole: They began to apprehend that their compa&s;s would prove an unfaithful guide; and the trade wind, which wafted them along with its friendly wings, they feared would ob&s;truct their return.</P>
<P>To be twenty days at &s;ea, without &s;ight of land, was what the bolde&s;t mariner had never before attempted. At the expiration of that time the impatient &s;ailors began to talk of throwing their commander into the ocean, and returning home. Their murmurs reach|ed his ears; but his active mind was never at
<PB N="101" REF="026637_0099_0FD0F97D987379C8">
a lo&s;s for expedients, even in the greate&s;t ex|tremity. By &s;oothing, flattery, and artifice, by inventing rea&s;ons for every uncommon ap|pearance, by promi&s;ing rewards to the obedi|ent, and a gratuity to him who &s;hould fir&s;t di&s;|cover land, in addition to what the King had ordered; and by deceiving them in the &s;hip's reckoning, he kept them on their cour&s;e for &s;ixteen days longer. In the night of the 11th of October, he him&s;elf &s;aw a light, which &s;eemed to be on &s;hore, and in the morning of the 12th, they had the joyful &s;ight of land, which proved to be the i&s;land of Guanahana, one of the clu&s;ter called Bahamas, in the 25th degree of north latitude.</P>
<P>Thus in the &s;pace of thirty &s;ix days, and in the 45th year of his age, Columbus complet|ed a voyage which he had &s;pent twenty years in projecting and executing; a voyage which opened to the Europeans a new world; which gave a new turn to their thoughts, to their &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e and of commerce; which enlarged the empire of Spain, and &s;tamped with immortality the name of Columbus.</P>
<P>After &s;pending &s;everal months in &s;ailing from one i&s;land to another in that va&s;t archi|pelago, which, from the mi&s;takes of the age
<PB N="102" REF="026637_0100_0FD0F97F477BD520">
received the name of the We&s;t-Indies. Colum|bus returned to Spain with the two &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, (the larger having been wrecked on the i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola) leaving behind him a colony of thirty nine men, furni&s;hed with a year's provi&s;ion, and lodged in a fort which had been built of the timber &s;aved from the wreck. During his pa&s;&s;age he met with a violent tempe&s;t which threatened him with de&s;truction. In this extremity, he gave an admirable proof of his calmne&s;s and fore&s;ight. He wrote on parchment an account of his di&s;coveries, wrapped it in a piece of oiled cloth, and inclo&s;ed it in a cake of wax, which he put into a tight ca&s;k and threw into the &s;ea. Another parchment, &s;ecured in the &s;ame manner, he placed on the &s;tern, that if the &s;hip &s;hould &s;ink, the ca&s;k might float, and po&s;&s;ibly one or the other might be driven on &s;hore, or taken up at &s;ea by &s;ome future navi|gator. But this precaution proved fruitle&s;s. He arrived &s;afe in Spain, in March, 1493, and was received with the honours due to his merit.</P>
<P>The account which Columbus gave of his new di&s;coveries, the &s;pecimens of gold and other valuable productions, and the &s;ight of
<PB N="103" REF="026637_0101_0FD0F98291C8F698">
the natives which he carried from the We&s;t-Indies to Spain, were &s;o plea&s;ing that the court determined on another expedition. But fir&s;t it was nece&s;&s;ary to obtain the &s;anction of the Pope, who readily granted it; and by an imaginary line, drawn from pole to pole, at the di&s;tance of one hundred leagues we&s;tward of the Azores, he divided between the crowns of Spain and Portugal, all the new countries already di&s;covered or to be di&s;cov|ered; giving the we&s;tern part to the former, and the ea&s;tern to the latter. No provi&s;ion however was made, in ca&s;e that they &s;hould meet, and their claims &s;hould interfere on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the globe. The bull, con|taining this famous but imperfect line of de|markation, was &s;igned by Alexander VI. on the &s;econd day of May, 1493; and on the 28th of the &s;ame month, the King and Queen of Spain, by a written in&s;trument, explained and confirmed the privileges and powers which they had before granted to Columbus, making the office of Viceroy and Governor of the Indies hereditary in his family. On the 25th of September following, he &s;ailed from Cadiz, with a fleet of &s;eventeen &s;hips, great and &s;mall, well furni&s;hed with all nece&s;|&s;aries
<PB N="104" REF="026637_0102_0FD0F98578FA3268">
for the voyage; and having on board 1500 people, with hor&s;es, cattle, and imple|ments to e&s;tabli&s;h plantations.</P>
<P>On Sunday the third of November, he di&s;|covered an i&s;land, to which, in honour of the day, he gave the name of Dominica. After|ward he di&s;covered in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion other i&s;lands, which he called Marigalante, Guadaloupe, Mont&s;errat, Redonda, Antigua, St. Martin's, St. Ur&s;ula, and St. John. On the 12th of November he came to Navidad, on the North &s;ide of Hi&s;paniola, where he had built his fort, and left his colony; but he had the mortification to find, that the people were all dead, and that the fort had been de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The account given by the natives, of the lo&s;s of the colony, was, that they fell into di&s;|cord among them&s;elves, on the u&s;ual &s;ubjects of controver&s;y, women and gold; that having provoked a chief, who&s;e name was Canaubo, he came again&s;t them with a &s;uperior force, and de&s;troyed them; that &s;ome of the natives, in attempting to defend them, had been kill|ed, and others were then ill of their wounds; which, on in&s;pection, appeared to have been made with Indian weapons.</P>
<P>Columbus prudently forbore to make any critical inquiry into the matter; but ha&s;ted
<PB N="105" REF="026637_0103_0FD0F9D1CD790150">
to e&s;tabli&s;h another colony, in a more eligible &s;ituation, to the ea&s;tward; which he called I&s;abella, after his royal patrone&s;s. He had many difficulties to contend with, be&s;ides tho&s;e which unavoidably attend undertakings of &s;uch novelty and magnitude. Nature in|deed was bountiful: the &s;oil and climate pro|duced vegetation, with a rapidity to which the Spaniards had not been accu&s;tomed. From wheat &s;own at the end of January, full ears were gathered at the end of March. The &s;tones of fruit, the &s;lips of vines and the joints of &s;ugar cane &s;prouted in &s;even days, and ma|ny other &s;eeds in half the time. This was an encouraging pro&s;pect; but the &s;low ope|rations of agriculture did not meet the views of &s;anguine adventurers. The numerous fol|lowers of Columbus, &s;ome of whom were of the be&s;t families in Spain, had conceived hopes of &s;uddenly enriching them&s;elves, by the pre|cious metals of tho&s;e new regions; and were not di&s;po&s;ed, to li&s;ten to his recommendations of patience and indu&s;try, in cultivating the earth. The natives were di&s;plea&s;ed with the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of their new neighbours; who endeavoured to keep them in awe by a di&s;|play of force. The explo&s;ion of fire arms,
<PB N="106" REF="026637_0104_0FD1038B059FCDD8">
and the &s;ight of men mounted on hor&s;es, were at fir&s;t, objects of terror; but u&s;e had render|ed them le&s;s formidable. Columbus, over|burdened with care and fatigue, fell &s;ick, and at his recovery, found a mutiny among his men; which, by a due mixture of re&s;olution and lenity, he had the addre&s;s to quell. He then endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h di&s;cipline among his own people, and to employ the natives in cutting roads through the woods. Whil&s;t he was pre&s;ent, and able to attend to bu&s;ine&s;s, things went on &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly, that he thought he might &s;afely proceed on his di&s;|coveries.</P>
<P>In his former voyage he had vi&s;ited Cuba; but was uncertain whether it were an i&s;land or a part of &s;ome continent. He therefore pa&s;&s;ed over to its ea&s;tern extremity; and coa&s;t|ed its &s;outhern &s;ide, till he found him&s;elf en|tangled among a va&s;t number of &s;mall i&s;lands, which for their beauty and fertility he called the Garden of the Queen; but the dangerous rocks and &s;hoals, which &s;urrounded them, obliged him to &s;tretch farther to the &s;outh|ward; by which means, he di&s;covered the i&s;land of Jamaica; where he found water and other refre&s;hments for his men, who were
<PB N="107" REF="026637_0105_0FD1038ED131EAA0">
almo&s;t dead with famine. The hazard, fa|tigue and di&s;tre&s;s of this voyage, threw him into a lethargic di&s;order, from which he had ju&s;t recovered, when he returned to his colo|ny and found it all in confu&s;ion; from the &s;ame cau&s;es which had proved de&s;tructive to the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>In his ab&s;ence, the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Spaniards had provoked &s;everal of the chiefs; four of whom had united to de&s;troy them, and had actually commenced ho&s;tilities, in which twenty Spaniards were killed. Co|lumbus collected his people, put them into the be&s;t order, and by a judicious combination of force and &s;tratagem gained a deci&s;ive victo|ry, to which the hor&s;es and dogs did not a little contribute.</P>
<P>At his return to Hi&s;paniola, he had the plea&s;ure of meeting his brother Bartholomew, whom he had not &s;een for &s;everal years, and whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to have been dead. Bar|tholomew was a man of equal knowledge, ex|perience, bravery and prudence with him&s;elf. His patience had endured a &s;evere trial in their long &s;eparation. He had many ob&s;tacles to &s;urmount, before he could get to England and obtain acce&s;s to the King. He was at
<PB N="108" REF="026637_0106_0FD1039119641388">
Paris when he heard of the &s;ucce&s;s of his brother's fir&s;t enterprize; who had gone on the &s;econd, before Bartholomew could get to Spain. On his arrival there, and being intro|duced to the court, he was appointed to the command of three &s;hips, which were de&s;|tined to convey &s;upplies to the colony; and he arrived whil&s;t Chri&s;topher was ab&s;ent on his voyage to Cuba and Jamaica. Columbus ap|pointed his brother to command at I&s;abella, whil&s;t he went into the interior part of the i&s;land, to perfect his conque&s;t, and reduce the natives to &s;ubjection and tribute.</P>
<P>The Indians were &s;o unu&s;ed to collect gold du&s;t, in &s;uch quantities as their conquerors demanded it, that they offered to plant the immen&s;e plains of Hi&s;paniola, and pay an e|quivalent in corn. Columbus was &s;truck with the magnanimity of the propo&s;al; and in con|&s;equence, moderated the tribute. This did not &s;atisfy the avarice of his fellow adventu|rers, who found means to complain of him to the King's mini&s;ters, for his negligence in acquiring the only commodity, which they thought de&s;erved the name of riches. The Indians then de&s;i&s;ted from planting their u&s;ual quantity of corn, and attempted to &s;ub&s;i&s;t
<PB N="109" REF="026637_0107_0FD103931B165768">
chiefly on animal food. This experiment proved injurious to them&s;elves as well as to their conquerors; and it was computed, that within four years, from the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the i&s;land, one third part of its inhabitants peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>The complaints again&s;t Columbus &s;o wrought on the jealous mind of King Ferdi|nand, that John Aguado, who was &s;ent, in 1495, with &s;upplies to the colony, had or|ders to act as a &s;py on his conduct. This man behaved with &s;o little di&s;cretion, as to &s;eek matter of accu&s;ation, and give out threats again&s;t the Admiral. At the &s;ame time, the &s;hips which he commanded, being de&s;troyed by a hurricane, he had no means left to return; till Columbus, knowing that he had enemies at home and nothing to &s;upport him but his own merit, re&s;olved to go to Spain, with two caravels; him&s;elf in one, and Aguado in the other. Having appointed proper per&s;ons to command the &s;everal forts; his brother Bar|tholomew to &s;uperintend the whole, and his brother James to be next in authority; he &s;et &s;ail on the tenth of March 1496, and after a perilous and tedious voyage, in the tropical
<PB N="110" REF="026637_0108_0FD103940654CDC8">
latitudes, arrived at Cadiz on the eleventh of June.</P>
<P>His pre&s;ence at Court, with the gold and other valuable articles which he carried home, removed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the prejudices which had been excited again&s;t him. But his enemies, though &s;ilent, were not idle; and in a court, where phlegm and languor proved a clog to the &s;pirit of enterprize, they found it not difficult to ob&s;truct his views; which, notwith&s;tanding all di&s;couragements, were &s;till pointed to the di&s;covery of a way to India by the we&s;t.</P>
<P>He now demanded eight &s;hips, to carry &s;upplies to his colony, and &s;ix to go on di&s;|covery. The&s;e demands were complied with, and he began his third voyage on the thir|tieth of May 1498. He kept a cour&s;e &s;o far to the &s;outhward, that not only his men, but his provi&s;ions and water &s;uffered greatly from ex|ce&s;&s;ive heat. The fir&s;t land he made after leaving the I&s;les of Cape de Verd, was a large i&s;land which he named Trinidad, from its ap|pearance in the form of three mountains. He then pa&s;&s;ed through a narrow &s;trait and whirl|pool into the gulf of Paria; where, ob&s;erv|ing the tide to be rapid, and the water brack|i&s;h,
<PB N="111" REF="026637_0109_0FD1039819F2F1C0">
he conjectured, that the land, on the we&s;tern and &s;outhern &s;ides of the gulf, was part of a continent; and that the fre&s;h water proceeded from &s;ome great rivers.</P>
<P>The people on the coa&s;t of Paria were whiter than tho&s;e of the i&s;lands. They had about their necks plates of gold and &s;trings of pearl; which they readily exchanged for piec|es of tin and bra&s;s, and little bells; and when they were que&s;tioned whence they obtained the gold and pearls, they pointed to the we&s;t.</P>
<P>The Admiral's provi&s;ion not allowing him to &s;tay long in this place; he pa&s;&s;ed again, through that dangerous &s;trait, to which he gave the name of the Dragon's Mouth; and having &s;atisfied him&s;elf, that the land on his left was a continent, he &s;teered to the N. W; di&s;covering Margarita and &s;everal other i&s;lands in his cour&s;e; and on the thirtieth of Augu&s;t, arrived at the harbour of St. Domingo, in Hi&s;paniola; to which place his brother had removed the colony in his ab&s;ence, in con|&s;equence of a plan preconcerted between them.</P>
<P>Wearied with ince&s;&s;ant care and watching, in this dangerous voyage, he hoped now to enjoy repo&s;e; in&s;tead of which he found his colony much reduced by deaths; many of
<PB N="112" REF="026637_0110_0FD1039A4F7D3D90">
the &s;urvivors &s;ick, with a di&s;ea&s;e, the peculiar con&s;equence of their debauchery; and a large number of them in actual rebellion. They had formed them&s;elves into a body; they had gained over many of the Indians, under pre|tence of protecting them; and they had retir|ed to a di&s;tant part of the i&s;land, which prov|ed a re&s;ort for the &s;editious and di&s;contented. Their commander was Francis Roldan, who had been Chief Ju&s;tice of the colony; and their number was &s;o con&s;iderable, that Columbus could not command a force &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue them. He therefore entered into a negociation, by offering a pardon to tho&s;e who would &s;ubmit, and liberty of returning to Spain to tho&s;e who de&s;ired it. The&s;e offers, however impolitic, proved &s;ucce&s;sful. Roldan him&s;elf accepted them, and per&s;uaded others to do the &s;ame; then, being re&s;tored to his office, he tried and condemned the refractory, &s;ome of whom were put to death.</P>
<P>An account of this mutiny was &s;ent home to Spain by Columbus and another by Rol|dan. Each had their advocates at court, and the cau&s;e was heard by the King and Queen. Roldan and his men were accu&s;ed of adultery, perjury, robbery, murder, and di&s;turbing the
<PB N="113" REF="026637_0111_0FD1039CADC15160">
peace of the whole i&s;land; whil&s;t Columbus was charged with cruelty to individuals, aim|ing at independence, and engro&s;&s;ing the tribute. It was in&s;inuated, that not being a native of Spain, he had no proper re&s;pect for the noble fami|lies, who had become adventurers; and that the debts due to them could not be recovered. It was &s;ugge&s;ted, that if &s;ome remedy were not &s;peedily applied, there was danger that he would revolt, and join with &s;ome other Prince; and that to compa&s;s this de&s;ign, he had con|cealed the real wealth of the colony, and pre|vented the conver&s;ion of the Indians to the Catholic faith.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;inuations prevailed on the jea|lou&s;y of Ferdinand, and even &s;taggered the con&s;tancy of I&s;abella. They re&s;olved to ap|point a judge, who &s;hould examine facts on the &s;pot; and if he &s;hould find the Admiral guilty, to &s;uper&s;ede him. For this purpo&s;e they &s;ent Francis Bovadilla, a man of noble rank, but who&s;e poverty alone recommended him to the office. Furni&s;hed with the&s;e pow|ers, he arrived at St. Domingo, when Colum|bus was ab&s;ent; took lodgings in his hou&s;e; invited accu&s;ers to appear again&s;t him; &s;eized on his effects, and finally &s;ent him and both
<PB N="114" REF="026637_0112_0FD103A5AE6B1650">
his brothers to Spain in three different &s;hips, but all loaded with irons.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the &s;hip in which the Admiral &s;ailed had &s;o much re&s;pect for him, that, when he had got to &s;ea, he offered to take off his fetters; but Columbus nobly declared, that he would permit that honour to be done him, by none but his &s;overeign. In this hu|miliating confinement, he was delivered to Fon&s;eca, Bi&s;hop of Badajos, who had been the chief in&s;tigator of all the&s;e rigorous proceed|ings, and to whom had been committed the affairs of the Indies.</P>
<P>Not content with robbing Columbus of his liberty, this prejudiced eccle&s;ia&s;tic would have deprived him of his well earned reputation of having fir&s;t di&s;covered the new continent. With the accu&s;ations which Columbus had &s;ent home again&s;t Roldan, he had tran&s;mitted an account of the di&s;covery of the coa&s;t of Paria, which he ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed to be part of a continent. Ojeda, an active officer, who had &s;ailed with Columbus in his &s;econd voy|age, was at court when the&s;e di&s;patches arriv|ed, and &s;aw the draught of the di&s;covery, with the &s;pecimens of gold and pearls, which the Admiral had &s;ent home. Being a favourite
<PB N="115" REF="026637_0113_0FD103A5B12EAAF0">
of Fon&s;eca, he ea&s;ily obtained leave to pur&s;ue the di&s;covery. Some merchants of Seville were prevailed upon to equip four &s;hips; with which, in 1499, Ojeda followed the track of Columbus, and made land on the coa&s;t of Paria. Amerigo Ve&s;pucci, a Florentine merchant, well &s;killed in geography and navigation, accompanied Ojeda in this voyage; and by publi&s;hing the fir&s;t book and chart, de&s;cribing the new world, obtained the hon|our of having it called AMERICA. This however did not happen till after the death of Columbus. Several other adventurers fol|lowed the &s;ame track, and all &s;uppo&s;ed that the continent which they had &s;een, was part of India.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was known, that Columbus was arrived at Cadiz, (Nov. 5, 1500) in the di&s;graceful &s;ituation abovementioned, the King and Queen, a&s;hamed of the orders which they had given, commanded him to be relea&s;ed, and invited him to court, where they apologized for the mi&s;behaviour of their new Governor, and not only promi&s;ed to recal him, but to re&s;tore to the Admiral all his effects. Co|lumbus could not forget the ignominy. He pre&s;erved the fetters, hung them up in his
<PB N="116" REF="026637_0114_0FD103A5B46E16B0">
apartment, and ordered them to be buried in his grave.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of rein&s;tating him in his government according to the original contract, the King and Queen &s;ent Ovando, to Hi&s;paniola, to &s;uper&s;ede Bovadilla; and only indulged Co|lumbus in pur&s;uing his darling project, the di&s;covery of India by the we&s;t, which he &s;till hoped to accompli&s;h. He &s;ailed again from Cadiz, on the fourth of May, 1502; with four ve&s;&s;els, carrying one hundred and forty men and boys; of which number were his brother Bartholomew and his &s;on Ferdinand, the writer of his life.</P>
<P>In his pa&s;&s;age to the Caribbee i&s;lands, he found his large&s;t ve&s;&s;el, of &s;eventy tons, unfit for the &s;ervice; and therefore went to St. Do|mingo, in hope of exchanging it for a better, and to &s;eek &s;helter from a &s;torm which he &s;aw approaching. To his infinite &s;urprize and mortification, Ovando would not admit him into the port. A fleet of thirty &s;hips was then ready to &s;ail for Spain, on board of which Roldan and Bovadilla were pri&s;oners. Co|lumbus informed Ovando, of the progno&s;tics which he had ob&s;erved, which Ovando di&s;re|garded, and the fleet &s;ailed. Columbus then
<PB N="117" REF="026637_0115_0FD103ABB88880F0">
laid three of his ve&s;&s;els, under the lee of the &s;hore; and, with great difficulty, rode out the tempe&s;t. His brother put to &s;ea; and by his great naval &s;kill &s;aved the &s;hip in which he &s;ailed. Of the fleet bound to Spain, eighteen &s;hips were lo&s;t, and in them peri&s;hed Roldan and Bovadilla.</P>
<P>The enemies of Columbus gave out that he had rai&s;ed this &s;torm by the art of magic; and &s;uch was the ignorance of the age, that the &s;tory was believed: What contributed the more to its credit, was, that one of the wor&s;t &s;hips of the fleet, on board of which were all the effects which had been &s;aved from the ru|ined fortune of Columbus, was the fir&s;t which arrived in Spain. The amount of the&s;e effects was "four thou&s;and pe&s;os of gold, each of the value of eight &s;hillings." The remark which Ferdinando Columbus makes on this event, &s;o de&s;tructive to the accu&s;ers of his father, is, "I am &s;atisfied, it was the hand of GOD, who was plea&s;ed to infatuate them; that they might not hearken to good advice; for had they arrived in Spain, they had never been puni&s;hed, as their crimes de&s;erved; but rath|er favoured and preferred as being the Bi&s;hop's friends."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 88.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="026637_0116_0FD103AEF6C49588">After this &s;torm, and another which fol|lowed it, Columbus having collected his lit|tle &s;quadron, &s;ailed on di&s;covery toward the continent; and, &s;teering to the &s;outhwe&s;t, came to an i&s;land called Guanania, twelve leagues from the coa&s;t of Honduras; where he met with a large covered canoe, having on board &s;everal pieces of cotton cloth of divers colours, which the people &s;aid they had brought from the we&s;tward. The men were armed with &s;words of wood, in which &s;harp flints were &s;trongly fixed. Their provi&s;ion was maize and roots, and they u&s;ed the ber|ries of cocoa as money. When the Admiral inquired for gold, they pointed to the we&s;t, and when he a&s;ked for a &s;trait by which he might pa&s;s through the land, they pointed to the ea&s;t. From the &s;pecimens of coloured cloth, he imagined, that they had come from India; and he hoped to pa&s;s thither, by the &s;trait which they de&s;cribed. Pur&s;uing his cour&s;e to the ea&s;t and &s;outh, he was led to the gulf of Darien; and vi&s;ited &s;everal harbours among which was one which he called Porto Bello; but he found no pa&s;&s;age extending through the land. He then returned to the we&s;tward; and landed on the coa&s;t of Vera|gua;

where the beauty and fertility of the country invited him to begin a plantation, which he called Belem; but the natives, a fierce and formidable race, deprived him of the honour of fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hing a colony on the continent, by killing &s;ome of his people and obliging him to retire with the others.</P>
<P>At &s;ea, he met with tempe&s;tuous weather of long continuance; in which his &s;hips were &s;o &s;hattered, that with the utmo&s;t difficulty he kept them above water, till he ran them a&s;hore on the i&s;land of Jamaica. By his extraordinary addre&s;s, he procured from the natives two of their large&s;t canoes; in which two of his mo&s;t faithful friends, Mendez and Fie&s;co, accompanied by &s;ome of his &s;ailors and a few Indians, embarked for Hi&s;|paniola. After encountering the greate&s;t dif|ficulties, in their pa&s;&s;age, they carried tidings of his misfortune to Ovando, and &s;olicited his aid. The mercile&s;s wretch detained them eight months, without an an&s;wer; during which time, Columbus &s;uffered the &s;evere&s;t hard&s;hips, from the di&s;content of his compa|ny, and the want of provi&s;ions. By the ho&s;|pitality of the natives, he at fir&s;t received &s;uch &s;upplies, as they were able to &s;pare; but the

long continuance of the&s;e gue&s;ts had dimin|i&s;hed their &s;tore, and the in&s;olence of the mu|tineers gave a check to their friend&s;hip. In this extremity, the fertile invention of Co|lumbus &s;ugge&s;ted an expedient which proved &s;ucce&s;sful. He knew that a total eclip&s;e of the moon was at hand, which would be vi&s;i|ble in the evening. On the preceding day, he &s;ent for the principal Indians, to &s;peak with them, on a matter of the utmo&s;t importance. Being a&s;&s;embled, he directed his interpreter to tell them, that the GOD of heaven, whom he wor&s;hipped, was angry with them, for withold|ing provi&s;ion from him, and would puni&s;h them with famine and pe&s;tilence; as a tok|en of which, the moon would, in the even|ing, appear of an angry and bloody colour. Some of them received his &s;peech with ter|ror, and others with indifference; but when the moon ro&s;e, and the eclip&s;e increa&s;ed as &s;he advanced from the horizon, they came in crowds, loaded with provi&s;ion, and begged the Admiral to intercede with his GOD, for the removal of his anger. Columbus retired to his cabin; and when the eclip&s;e began to go off, he came out and told them, that he had pray|ed to his GOD, and had received this an&s;wer;
<PB N="121" REF="026637_0119_0FD103B4C429FAA0">
that if they would be good for the future, and bring him provi&s;ion as he &s;hould want, GOD would forgive them; and as a token of it, the moon would put on her u&s;ual brightne&s;s. They gave him thanks, and promi&s;ed com|pliance; and whil&s;t he remained on the i&s;land there was no more want of provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the end of eight months, Ovando &s;ent a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el to Jamaica, with a ca&s;k of wine, two flitches of bacon, and a letter of compli|ment and excu&s;e, which the officer deliver|ed; and without waiting for an an&s;wer, weighed his anchor the &s;ame evening and &s;ail|ed back to Hi&s;paniola. The men who adhered to Columbus and were with him on board the wrecks, wondered at the &s;udden departure of the ve&s;&s;el, by which they expected deliverance. Columbus, never at a lo&s;s for an eva&s;ion, told them that the caravel was too &s;mall to take the whole company, and he would not go with|out them. This fiction had the de&s;ired effect; tho&s;e who adhered to him re&s;umed their pa|tience; but the mutineers became &s;o in&s;olent that it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubdue them by force. In the conte&s;t ten of them were killed. Por|ras, their leader, was made pri&s;oner and the others e&s;caped. Bartholomew Columbus

<P>The fugitives, having lo&s;t their leader, thought it be&s;t to &s;ubmit; and on the next day &s;ent a petition to the Admiral, confe&s;&s;ing their fault, and promi&s;ing fidelity. This promi&s;e they confirmed by an oath, of which the imprecation was &s;ingular; "they re|nounced, in ca&s;e of failure, any ab&s;olution from Prie&s;t, Bi&s;hop, or Pope, at the time of their death; and all benefit from the &s;acraments of the Church; con&s;enting to be buried like heathens and infidels in the open field." The Admiral received their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, provided that Porras &s;hould continue pri&s;oner, and they would accept a commander of his appoint|ment, as long as they &s;hould remain on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>At length a ve&s;&s;el, which Mendez had been permitted to buy, with the Admiral's money, at Hi&s;paniola, came to Jamaica, and took them off. On their arrival at St. Do|mingo (Augu&s;t 13, 1504) Ovando affected great joy, and treated the Admiral with a &s;how of re&s;pect; but he liberated Porras, and threat|ened with puni&s;hment the faithful adherents of Columbus.

<P>The per&s;ecution and inju&s;tice which he &s;uffered, may be traced up to the contract, which he in&s;i&s;ted on, before he engaged in the plan of di&s;covery. That a foreigner &s;hould attain &s;o high a rank as to be Viceroy for life, and that the honour of an Admiral &s;hould be hereditary in his family, to the ex|clu&s;ion of all the nobles of Spain, was more than their pride and jealou&s;y could endure; and they con&s;tantly endeavoured to depreciate his merit; the only foundation on which his honours were erected.</P>
<P>There is a &s;tory recorded by Peter Martyr, a contemporary hi&s;torian, which exemplifies their malice, and his ingenuity in ri&s;ing &s;upe|rior to it. After the death of the Queen, the nobility affected to in&s;inuate, that his di&s;cov|eries were more the re&s;ult of accident and good fortune, than of any well concerted mea&s;ures. One day at a public dinner, Columbus having borne much in&s;ulting raillery on that head,
<PB N="126" REF="026637_0124_0FD103C005C24228">
at length called for an egg, and a&s;ked whether any of them could &s;et it upright on its little end. They all confe&s;&s;ed it to be impo&s;&s;ible. Columbus &s;triking it gently, flatted the &s;hell till it &s;tood upright on the table. The com|pany, with a di&s;dainful &s;neer, cryed out, "Any body might have done it."&mdash;"Yes (&s;aid Columbus) but none of you thought of it; &s;o I di&s;covered the Indies, and now every pilot can &s;teer the &s;ame cour&s;e. Many things appear ea&s;y when once performed, though before, they were thought impo&s;&s;ible. Remember the &s;coffs that were thrown at me, before I put my de&s;ign in execution. Then it was a dream, a chimera, a delu&s;ion; now it is what any body might have done as well as I." When this &s;tory was told to Ferdinand, he could not but admire the grandeur of that &s;pirit, which at the &s;ame time he was endeav|ouring to depre&s;s.</P>
<P>Writers of different countries have treated the character of Columbus according to their prejudices, either national or per&s;onal. It is &s;urpri&s;ing to ob&s;erve, how the&s;e prejudices have de&s;cended; and that even at the di&s;tance of three centuries, there are &s;ome, who affect to deny him the virtues for which he was con|&s;picuous,
<PB N="127" REF="026637_0125_0FD103C00892E688">
and the merit of originating a di&s;|covery, which is an honour to human rea&s;on. His humanity has been called in que&s;tion, becau&s;e he carried dogs to the We&s;t Indies, and employed them in extirpating the natives. The truth is, that in his &s;econd expedition he was accompanied by a number of gentle|men of the be&s;t families in Spain; and many more would have gone if it had been po&s;&s;ible to accommodate them. The&s;e gentlemen car|ried with them "hor&s;es, a&s;&s;es and other bea&s;ts, which were of great u&s;e in a new plantation." The conflict which Columbus had with the natives was in con&s;equence of the di&s;orderly conduct of the&s;e Spaniards; who, in his ab|&s;ence, had taken their goods, abu&s;ed their women and committed other outrages, which the Indians could not endure, and therefore made war upon them. In this war he found his colony engaged, when he returned from his voyage to Cuba; and there was no way to end it, but by pur&s;uing it with vigour. With two hundred Spaniards, of whom <HI>twen|ty</HI> were mounted on "hor&s;es followed by <HI>as many</HI> dogs," he encountered a numerous body of Indians, e&s;timated at one hundred thou&s;and, on a large plain. He divided his men into
<PB N="128" REF="026637_0126_0FD103C75F019388">
two parties, and attacked them on two &s;ides: the noi&s;e of the fire arms, &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed them, and the hor&s;es and dogs prevented them from rallying; and thus a complete victory was obtained. In this in&s;tance alone, were the dogs u&s;ed again&s;t the natives. They nat|urally followed their ma&s;ters into the field, and the hor&s;es to which they were accu&s;tom|ed; but to &s;uppo&s;e that Columbus tran&s;ported them to the We&s;t Indies, with a view to de|&s;troy the Indians, appears altogether idle, when it is con&s;idered that the number is rec|koned only at twenty. Excepting in this in&s;tance, where he was driven by nece&s;&s;ity, there is no evidence, that he made war on the natives of the We&s;t Indies; on the contrary, he endeavoured as far as po&s;&s;ible to treat them with ju&s;tice and gentlene&s;s. The &s;ame can|not be &s;aid of tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded him.</P>
<P>Attempts have al&s;o been made to detract from his merit, as an original di&s;coverer of the New World. The mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful candidate, who has been &s;et up as a rival to him, is MARTIN BEHAIM of Nuremberg in Ger|many. His claim to a prior di&s;covery has been &s;o well conte&s;ted, and the vanity of it &s;o fully expo&s;ed by the late Dr. Robert&s;on, that

<P>It is conceded that Behaim was a man of learning and enterpri&s;e; that he was contem|porary with Columbus, and was his friend; that he pur&s;ued the &s;ame &s;tudies and drew the &s;ame conclu&s;ions; that he was employed by King John II. in making di&s;coveries; and, that he met with de&s;erved honour for the im|portant &s;ervices which he rendered to the crown of Portugal.

what de&s;troys the credibility of this plau&s;ible tale, is, that Columbus had formed his theo|ry, and projected his voyage, at lea&s;t ten years before; as appears by his corre&s;pondence with Paul, a learned phy&s;ician of Florence, which bears date in 1474.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life, chap. viii.</NOTE> It is uncertain at what time Columbus fir&s;t made his application to the King of Portugal, to fit him out for a we&s;tern voyage; but it is certain that after a negociation with him on the &s;ubject, and after he had found out the &s;ecret and un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt, which had been made to anticipate a di&s;covery; he quitted that kingdom in di&s;|gu&s;t, and went into Spain, in the latter end of the year 1484. The authority of the&s;e facts is unque&s;tioned; and from them it fully appears, that a prior di&s;covery of America, by Behaim or Sanchez, made in 1484, could not have been the foundation of the enterpri&s;e of Columbus.</P>

From the chronicle of Hartman Schedl, as quoted by M. Otto, we are informed, that Behaim &s;ailed with Cam, in the&s;e voyages, which are de&s;cribed in the following terms. "The&s;e two, by the bounty of heaven, coa&s;t|ing along the &s;outhern ocean, and having

<P>M.

Then follows a particular detail of the ceremony of in&s;tallation, as performed on the 18th of Feb|ruary, 1485, and M. Otto fairly owns that this was "a reward for the di&s;covery of Con|go."
<PB N="136" REF="026637_0134_0FD103DF8EDD8AC0">
Now let us bring the detached parts of the &s;tory together.</P>
<P>Behaim was knighted on the 18th of Feb|ruary, 1485, for the di&s;covery of Congo, in which he had been employed 26 months pre|ceding; having within that time made two voyages thither, in company with Diego Cam. It will follow then that the whole of the pre|ceding years, 1484 and 1483, were taken up in the&s;e two voyages. This agrees very well with the accounts of the di&s;covery of Congo, in Robert&s;on and For&s;ter, and does not di&s;a|gree with the modern univer&s;al hi&s;tory, as far as the year 1484 is concerned; which unfor|tunately is the year a&s;&s;igned for Behaim's di&s;|covery of "that part of America called Bra&s;il, and his &s;ailing even to the &s;traits of Magel|lan."</P>
<P>The only thing in M. Otto's memoir which bears any re&s;emblance to a &s;olution of this difficulty is this. "We may &s;uppo&s;e that Behaim, engaged in an expedition to Congo, was driven by the winds to Fernam|bouc, and from thence by the currents tow|ard the coa&s;t of Guiana." But &s;uppo&s;itions without proof will avail little; and &s;uppo&s;i|tions again&s;t proof will avail nothing. The
<PB N="137" REF="026637_0135_0FD103E12A12F730">
two voyages to Congo are admitted. The cour&s;e is de&s;cribed; and the time is determin|ed; and both the&s;e are directly oppo&s;ed to the &s;uppo&s;ition of his being driven by winds and currents to America. For if he had been driven out of his cour&s;e and had &s;pent "&s;ever|al years in examining the American i&s;lands, and di&s;covering the &s;trait which bears the name of Magellan;" and if one of tho&s;e years was the year 1484, then he could not have &s;pent 26 months preceding February, 1485, in the di&s;covery of Congo; but of this we have full and &s;atisfactory evidence; the di&s;cov|ery of America therefore mu&s;t be given up.</P>
<P>There is one thing further in this memoir which de&s;erves a particular remark, and that is the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by M. Otto, for which the King of Portugal declined the propo&s;al of Columbus to &s;ail to India by the we&s;t. "The refu&s;al of John II. is a proof of the knowl|edge which that politic prince had <HI>already</HI> procured, of the exi&s;tence of a new continent, which offered him only barren lands, inhabit|ed by unconquerable &s;avages." This knowl|edge is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been derived from the di&s;coveries made by Behaim. But, not to urge again the chronological difficulty with
<PB N="138" REF="026637_0136_0FD103E4D2248BE8">
which this conjecture is embarra&s;&s;ed, I will take notice of two circum&s;tances in the life of Columbus, which militate with this idea. The fir&s;t is, that when Columbus had pro|po&s;ed a we&s;tern voyage to King John, and he declined it, "The King, by the advice of one Doctor Calzadilla, re&s;olved to &s;end a caravel privately, to attempt that which Columbus had propo&s;ed to him; becau&s;e in ca&s;e tho&s;e countries were &s;o di&s;covered, he thought him|&s;elf not obliged to be&s;tow any great reward. Having &s;peedily equipped a caravel, which was to carry &s;upplies to the i&s;lands of Cabo Verde, he &s;ent it that way which the Admiral propo&s;|ed to go. But tho&s;e whom he &s;ent wanted the knowledge, con&s;tancy and &s;pirit of the Admiral. After wandering many days upon the &s;ea, they turned back to the i&s;lands of Cabo Verde, laughing at the undertaking, and &s;aying it was <HI>impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould he any land in tho&s;e &s;eas.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, chap. xi.</NOTE></P>
<P>Afterward, "the King being &s;en&s;ible how faulty they were whom he had &s;ent with the caravel, had a mind to re&s;tore the Admiral to his favour, and de&s;ired that he &s;hould renew the di&s;cour&s;e of his enterprize; but not being
<PB N="139" REF="026637_0137_0FD103E8103229F8">
&s;o diligent to put this in execution, as the Admiral was in getting away, he lo&s;t that good opportunity; the Admiral, about the end of the year 1484, &s;tole away privately out of Portugal for fear of being &s;topped by the King." This account does not agree with the &s;uppo&s;ition of a prior di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The other circum&s;tance is an interview which Columbus had with the people of Li&s;|bon, and the King of Portugal, on his return from his fir&s;t voyage. For it &s;o happened that Columbus on his return was by &s;tre&s;s of weather obliged to take &s;helter in the port of Li&s;bon; and as &s;oon as it was known that he had come from the Indies, "the people thronged to &s;ee the natives whom he had brought and hear the news; &s;o that the cara|vel would not contain them. Some of them prai&s;ing God for &s;o great a happine&s;s; others &s;torming <HI>that they had lo&s;t the di&s;covery through their King's incredulity.</HI>"</P>
<P>When the King &s;ent for Columbus, "he was doubtful what to do; but to take off all &s;u&s;picion that he came <HI>from his conque&s;ts,</HI> he con&s;ented." At the interview, "the King offered him all that he &s;tood in need of for the &s;ervice of their Catholic Maje&s;ties, though
<PB N="140" REF="026637_0138_0FD103EBB61A8A48">
he thought, that fora&s;much <HI>as he had been a Captain in Portugal,</HI> that conque&s;t belonged to him. To which the Admiral an&s;wered, that he knew of no &s;uch agreement, and that he had &s;trictly ob&s;erved his orders, which were <HI>not to go to the mines of Portugal,</HI> [the gold coa&s;t] nor to Guinea."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life, chap. xli.</NOTE> Had John II. heard of Behaim's voyage to a we&s;tern conti|nent, would he not have claimed it by priority of di&s;covery, rather than by the commi&s;&s;ion which Columbus had formerly borne in his &s;ervice? Had &s;uch a prior di&s;covery been made, could it have been concealed from the people of Li&s;bon? And would they have been angry that their King had lo&s;t it by his in|credulity? The&s;e circum&s;tances appear to me to carry &s;ufficient evidence, that <HI>no</HI> di&s;cov|ery of America prior to that of Columbus had come to the knowledge of the King of Portugal.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the que&s;tion "Why are we &s;earching the archives of an imperial city for the cau&s;es of an event, which took place in the we&s;tern extremity of Europe?" M. Otto gives us to under&s;tand, that "from the four|teenth to the &s;ixteenth centuries, the Germans
<PB N="141" REF="026637_0139_0FD103ED50115B88">
were the be&s;t geographers, the be&s;t hi&s;torians and the mo&s;t enlightened politicians." Not to detract from the merit of the German lite|rati of tho&s;e ages, I think we may give equal credit to a learned German author of the pre|&s;ent age, Dr. John Reinhold For&s;ter; who appears to have a thorough under&s;tanding of the claims not only of his own countrymen, but of others. In his indefatigable re&s;earches into the di&s;coveries which have been made by all nations, though he has given due credit to the adventures of Behaim in Congo and Fayal, yet he has not &s;aid one word of his vi&s;iting America; which he certainly would have done, if in his opinion there had been any foundation for it.</P>

Oppo&s;ite to which we&s;tern coa&s;t is de&s;cribed the beginning of the Indies, with the i&s;lands and places whither you may go, and how far you may bend from the north pole toward the equinoctial, and for how long a time; that is, how many leagues you may &s;ail, before you come to tho&s;e places mo&s;t fruitful in all &s;orts of &s;pice, jewels and precious &s;tones.

know; you mu&s;t under&s;tand, that none but traders live or re&s;ide in all tho&s;e i&s;lands, and that there is as great number of &s;hips and &s;ea|faring people with merchandi&s;e, as in any other part of the world; particularly in a mo&s;t noble port called <HI>Zacton,</HI> where there are every year a hundred large &s;hips of pepper, loaded and unloaded, be&s;ides many other &s;hips that take in other &s;pice.</P>
<P>This country is mighty populous, and there are many provinces and kingdoms, and innu|merable cities under the dominion of a prince called the <HI>Kham,</HI> which name &s;ignifies, King of Kings; who for the mo&s;t part re&s;ides in the Province of <HI>Cathay.</HI> His predece&s;&s;ors were very de&s;irous to have commerce and be in amity with Chri&s;tians; and 200 years &s;ince, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the Pope; de&s;iring him to &s;end them many learned men and doctors to teach them our faith; but by rea&s;on of &s;ome ob&s;tacles the amba&s;&s;adors met with, they re|turned back, without coming to Rome.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there came an amba&s;&s;ador to Pope Eugenius IV. who told him the great friend|&s;hip there was between tho&s;e princes, their people, and the Chri&s;tians. I di&s;cour&s;ed with him a long while upon the &s;everal matters of

the grandeur of their royal &s;tructures, and of the greatne&s;s, length and breadth of their riv|ers. He told me many wonderful things of the multitude of towns and cities founded a|long the banks of the rivers; and that there were 200 cities upon one river only, with marble bridges over it, of a great length and breadth, and adorned with abundance of pil|lars. This country de&s;erves as well as any other to be di&s;covered; and there may not only be great profit made there, and many things of value found, but al&s;o gold, &s;ilver, all &s;orts of precious &s;tones, and &s;pices in abundance, which are not brought into our parts. And it is certain, that many wi&s;e men, philo&s;ophers, a&s;trologers, and other per&s;ons &s;killed in all arts, and very ingenious, govern that mighty province, and command their armies.</P>
<P>From Li&s;bon directly we&s;tward, there are in the chart 26 &s;paces, each of which contains 250 miles, to the mo&s;t noble and va&s;t city of <HI>Qui&s;ay,</HI> which is 100 miles in compa&s;s, that is 35 leagues; in it there are ten marble bridges.

<HEAD>V. JOHN CABOT AND SEBASTIAN CABOT.</HEAD>
<P>THE economical di&s;po&s;ition of Henry VII, King of England, induced him to pre|&s;erve tranquillity in his dominions, which greatly contributed to the increa&s;e of com|merce and manufactures; and to bring thith|er merchants from all parts of Europe. The Lombards and the Venetians were remarkably numerous; the former of whom had a &s;treet in London appropriated to them and called by their name.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For&s;ter's northern Voyages, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">6.</NOTE></P>
<P>Among the Venetians re&s;ident there at that time was JOHN CABOT, a man perfectly &s;kil|led in all the &s;ciences requi&s;ite to form an ac|compli&s;hed mariner.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Campbell's Lives of Admirals, i.336.</NOTE> He had three &s;ons, Lewis, SEBASTIAN and Sanctius,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hakluyt.

Of Se|ba&s;tian a farther account will be given.</P>
<P>The famous di&s;covery made by Columbus cau&s;ed great admiration and much di&s;cour&s;e,
<PB N="150" REF="026637_0148_0FD104091AA4CD00">
in the court of Henry, and among the merch|ants of England. To find a way to India by the we&s;t, had long been a problem with men of &s;cience as well as a de&s;ideratum in the mer|cantile intere&s;t. The way was then &s;uppo&s;ed to be opened; and the &s;pecimens of gold, which Columbus had brought home, excited the warme&s;t de&s;ire of pur&s;uing that di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Cabot, by his knowledge of the globe, &s;up|po&s;ed that a &s;horter way might be found from England to India, by the northwe&s;t. Hav|ing communicated his project to the King, it was favourably received; and on the fifth of March 1496, a commi&s;&s;ion was granted to "John Cabot, and his three &s;ons, their heirs and deputies, giving them liberty to &s;ail to all parts of ea&s;t, we&s;t, and north, under the royal banners, and en&s;igns; to di&s;cover coun|tries of the <HI>heathen,</HI> unknown to <HI>chri&s;tians</HI>; to &s;et up the King's banners there; to occupy and po&s;&s;e&s;s as his &s;ubjects, &s;uch places as they could &s;ubdue; giving them the rule and ju|ri&s;diction of the &s;ame, to be holden on condi|tion of paying to the King, as often as they &s;hould arrive at Bri&s;tol, (at which place only they were permitted to arrive) in wares and merchandi&s;e, one fifth part of all their gains;

<P>After the granting of this commi&s;&s;ion, the King gave orders for fitting out two caravels for the purpo&s;e of the di&s;covery. The&s;e were victualled at the public expen&s;e; and freight|ed by the merchants of London and Bri&s;tol, with coar&s;e cloths and other articles of traffic.

<P>Nothing more is &s;aid of John Cabot, the father; and &s;ome hi&s;torians a&s;cribe the whole of this di&s;covery to Seba&s;tian only; but at the time of this voyage he could not have been more than twenty years old; when, though he might accompany his father, yet he was too young to undertake &s;uch an expedition him|&s;elf. The voyage having produced no &s;pe|cimens of gold; and the King being engaged in a controver&s;y with Scotland, no farther encouragement was given to the &s;pirit of di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>After the King's death, Seba&s;tian Cabot was invited to Spain, and was received in a re&s;pectful manner by King Ferdinand and Queen I&s;abella. In their &s;ervice he &s;ailed on

a voyage of di&s;covery to the &s;outhern parts of the New Continent; and having vi&s;ited the coa&s;t of Bra&s;il, entered a great river to which he gave the name of Rio de la Plata. He &s;ailed up this river one hundred and twen|ty leagues; and found it divided into many branches; the &s;hores of which were inhab|ited by numerous people.</P>
<P>After this, he made other voyages, of which no particular memorials remain. He was honoured by Ferdinand, with a commi&s;&s;ion of Grand Pilot; and was one of the council of the Indies. His re&s;idence was in the city of Se|ville. His character was gentle, friendly and &s;ocial. His employment was the drawing of charts; on which he delineated all the new di&s;coveries made by him&s;elf and others.

<P>In his advanced age, he returned to Eng|land, and re&s;ided at Bri&s;tol. By the fav|our of the Duke of Somer&s;et, he was intro|duced to King Edward VI, who took great delight in his conver&s;ation, and &s;ettled on him a pen&s;ion of &pound;166. 13<HI>&s;.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> per annum for

<P>"The 27th of April, being Monday, the Right Wor&s;hipful Seba&s;tian Cabota came a|board our pinnace, at Grave&s;end; accompani|ed with divers gentlemen and gentlewomen; who, after they had viewed our pinnace, and ta&s;ted of &s;uch cheer as we could make them, went a&s;hore, giving to our mariners right lib|eral rewards.

<P>THOUGH the Engli&s;h did not pro&s;e|cute the di&s;covery made by the Cabots, nor avail them&s;elves of the only advantages which it could have afforded them; yet their neigh|bours of Brittany,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;uppo&s;ed that the i&s;land of Cape Breton took its name from the Bretons, the fi&s;hermen of Brittany.</NOTE> Normandy and Bi&s;cay wi&s;ely pur&s;ued the track of tho&s;e adventurers and took va&s;t quantities of cod on the banks of Newfoundland.</P>
<P>In 1524, John Verazzani, a Florentine, in the &s;ervice of France, ranged the coa&s;t of the new continent from Florida to Newfound|land, and gave it the name of <HI>New France.</HI> In a &s;ub&s;equent voyage he was cut to pieces and devoured by the &s;avages.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that the three great Euro|pean kingdoms Spain, England and France, made u&s;e of three Italians to conduct their di&s;|coveries: Columbus, a Genoe&s;e; Cabot, a Venetian; and Verazzani, a Florentine. This is a proof that among the Italians there were at that time per&s;ons &s;uperior in maritime knowledge to the other nations of Europe;

though the penurious &s;pirit of tho&s;e repub|lics, their mutual jealou&s;y and petty wars, made them overlook the benefits re&s;ulting from ex|ten&s;ive enterpri&s;es, and leave the va&s;t regions of the new world to be occupied by others.</P>
<P>The voyages of Verazzani having produc|ed no addition to the revenue of France; all further attempts to perfect his di&s;coveries were laid a&s;ide; but the fi&s;hery being found conducive to the commercial intere&s;t, it was at length conceived, that a plantation in the neighbourhood of the banks might be advan|tageous. This being repre&s;ented to King Francis I, by Chabot the Admiral, JAMES CARTIER<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His name is &s;ometimes written <HI>Quartier.</HI></NOTE> of St. Malo, was commi&s;&s;ioned to explore the country, with a view to find a place for a colony.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For&s;ter's northern voyages, p. 435.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the 20th of April 1534, he &s;ailed from St. Malo with two &s;hips of &s;ixty tons, and 122 men; and on the tenth of May came in &s;ight of Bonavi&s;ta, on the i&s;land of Newfoundland. But the ice which lay along the &s;hore obliged him to go &s;outhward; and he entered a har|bour to which he gave the name of St. Catha|rine;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Called in &s;ome maps <HI>Catalina.</HI></NOTE> where he waited for fair weather, and fitted his boats.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="026637_0159_0FD10421CA02DDC0">As &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on would permit he &s;ail|ed northward, and examined &s;everal harbours and i&s;lands, on the coa&s;t of Newfoundland; in one of which he found &s;uch a quantity of birds, that in half an hour, two boats were loaded with them; and after they had eaten as many as they could, five or &s;ix barrels full were &s;alted for each &s;hip. This place was called Bird I&s;land.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed Cape de Grat, the northern extremity of the land; he entered the &s;traits of Belli&s;le and vi&s;ited &s;everal harbours on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Labrador, one of which he called Cartier's Sound. The harbour is de|&s;cribed as one of the be&s;t in the world; but the land is &s;tigmatized as the place to which Cain was bani&s;hed; no vegetation being pro|duced among the rocks, but thorns and mo&s;s. Yet, bad as it was, there were inhabitants in it, who lived by catching &s;eals, and &s;eemed to be a wandering tribe.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hakluyt, vol. iii, p. 201&mdash;211.</NOTE></P>
<P>In circumnavigating the great i&s;land of New|foundland, they found the weather in gener|al cold; but when they had cro&s;&s;ed the gulf in a &s;outhwe&s;terly direction to the continent, they came into a deep bay, where the climate
<PB N="162" REF="026637_0160_0FD10424497EAA00">
was &s;o warm, that they named it Baye de Cha|leur, or the Bay of Heat. Here were &s;everal kinds of wild berries, ro&s;es and meadows of gra&s;s. In the fre&s;h waters they caught &s;al|mon in great plenty.</P>
<P>Having &s;earched in vain for a pa&s;&s;age through the bay, they quitted it, and &s;ailed along the coa&s;t, ea&s;tward, till they came to the &s;maller bay of Ga&s;p&egrave;; where they &s;ought &s;helter from a tempe&s;t, and were detained twelve days in the month of July. In this place Cartier performed the ceremony of taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for the King of France. A cro&s;s of thirty feet high was erected on a point of land. On this cro&s;s was &s;u&s;pended a &s;hield, with the arms of France and the words <HI>Vive le Roy de France.</HI> Before it, the people kneeled, un|covered; with their hands extended, and their eyes lifted toward heaven. The natives, who were pre&s;ent, beheld the ceremony at fir&s;t with &s;ilent admiration; but after a while, an old man, clad in a bear's &s;kin, made &s;igns to them that the land was his, and that they &s;hould not have it, without his leave. They then informed him by &s;igns, that the cro&s;s was intended only as a mark of direction, by which they might again find the port; and
<PB N="163" REF="026637_0161_0FD104270DF06F88">
they promi&s;ed to return the next year, and to bring iron and other commodities.</P>
<P>They thought it proper however to con|ciliate the old man's good will, by entertaining him on board the &s;hip and making him &s;ev|eral pre&s;ents; by which means, they &s;o pre|vailed on him, that he permitted Cartier to carry two of his &s;ons, young men, to France, on the &s;ecurity of a promi&s;e that he would bring them back, at his return the next &s;pring.</P>
<P>From Ga&s;p&egrave;, he &s;ailed &s;o far into the Great River, afterward called St. Lawrence, as to di&s;cover land on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide; but the weather being boi&s;terous, and the current &s;et|ting again&s;t him, he thought it be&s;t to return to Newfoundland, and then to France; where he arrived &s;afe in the harbour of St. Malo on the fifth of September.</P>
<P>The di&s;coveries made in this voyage excit|ed farther curio&s;ity; and the Vice Admiral Melleraye repre&s;ented Cartier's merits to the King, &s;o favourably, as to procure for him a more ample equipment. Three &s;hips, one of 120, one of 60 and one of 40 tons, were de&s;tined to perform another voyage, in the en&s;uing &s;pring; and &s;everal young men of di&s;|tinction
<PB N="164" REF="026637_0162_0FD104289A889E28">
entered as volunteers, to &s;eek adven|tures in the new world. When they were ready to &s;ail, the whole company, after the example of Columbus, went in proce&s;&s;ion to church, on Whit&s;unday, where the Bi&s;hop of St. Malo pronounced his ble&s;&s;ing on them. They &s;ailed on the 19th of May 1535. Meet|ing with tempe&s;tuous weather, the &s;hips were &s;eparated; and did not join again, till Cartier in the large&s;t &s;hip arrived at Bird I&s;land; where he again filled his boats with fowls, and on the 26th of July was joined by the other ve&s;|&s;els.</P>
<P>From Bird I&s;land they pur&s;ued the &s;ame cour&s;e as in the preceding &s;ummer; and hav|ing come into the gulf on the we&s;tern &s;ide of Newfoundland, gave it the name of St. Law|rence. Here they &s;aw abundance of whales. Pa&s;&s;ing between the i&s;land of A&s;&s;umption (&s;ince called Antico&s;ti) and the northern &s;hore, they &s;ailed up the great river, till they came to a branch on the northern &s;ide, which the young natives who were on board called Saguenay; the main river they told him would carry him to Hochelaga, the capital of the whole country.</P>
<P>After &s;pending &s;ome time in exploring the northern coa&s;t, to find an opening to the
<PB N="165" REF="026637_0163_0FD1042B64695D88">
northward; in the beginning of September, he &s;ailed up the river and di&s;covered &s;everal i&s;lands; one of which, from the multitude of filberts, he called Coudres; and another, from the va&s;t quantity of grapes, he named Bacchus, (now Orleans.) This i&s;land was full of inhabitants who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>When the &s;hips had come to anchor be|tween the N. W. &s;ide of the i&s;land and the main, Cartier went on &s;hore with his two young Savages. The people of the country were at fir&s;t afraid of them; but hearing the youths &s;peak to them in their own language, they became &s;ociable, and brought eels and other fi&s;h, with a quantity of Indian corn in ears, for the refre&s;hment of their new gue&s;ts; in return for which, they were pre|&s;ented with &s;uch European baubles as were plea&s;ing to them.</P>
<P>The next day, Donacona, the prince of the place, came to vi&s;it them, attended by twelve boats; but keeping ten of them at a di&s;tance, he approached with two only, containing &s;ix|teen men. In the true &s;pirit of ho&s;pitality, he made a &s;peech, accompanied with &s;ignifi|cant ge&s;tures, welcoming the French to his country and offering his &s;ervice to them. The
<PB N="166" REF="026637_0164_0FD1042D0AB5DDF8">
young &s;avages, Taignoagni and Domagaia an&s;wered him, reporting all which they had &s;een in France, at which he appeared to be plea&s;ed. Then approaching the Captain, who held out his hand, he ki&s;&s;ed it, and laid it round his own neck, in token of friend&s;hip. Cartier, on his part, entertained Donacona with bread and wine, and they parted mutu|ally plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The next day Cartier went up in his boat to find a harbour for his &s;hips; the &s;ea&s;on being &s;o far advanced that it became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure them. At the we&s;t end of the i&s;le of Bacchus, he found "a goodly and plea&s;ant &s;ound, where is a little river and haven; a|bout three fathom deep at high water." To this he gave the name of St. Croix, and de|termined there to lay up his &s;hips.</P>
<P>Near this place was a village called Stada|cona, of which Donacona was the Lord. It was environed with fore&s;t trees, &s;ome of which bore fruit; and under the trees, was a growth of wild hemp. As Cartier was returning to his &s;hips, he had another &s;pecimen of the ho&s;pitable manners of the natives. A com|pany of people, of both &s;exes, met him on the &s;hore of the little river, &s;inging and danc|ing
<PB N="167" REF="026637_0165_0FD104352087A300">
up to their knees in water. In return for their courte&s;y, he gave them knives and beads; and they continued their mu&s;ic till he was beyond hearing it.</P>
<P>When Cartier had brought his &s;hips to the harbour and &s;ecured them, he intimated his intention to pa&s;s in his boats up the river to Hochelaga. Donacona was loth to part with him; and invented &s;everal artifices to pre|vent his going thither. Among others, he contrived to dre&s;s three of his men in black and white &s;kins, with horns on their heads and their faces be&s;meared with coal, to make them re&s;emble infernal &s;pirits. They were put into a canoe and pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;hips; brandi&s;hing their horns and making an unin|telligible harrangue. Donacona, with his people, pur&s;ued and took them, on which they fell down as if dead. They were carried a&s;hore into the woods, and all the &s;avages fol|lowed them. A long di&s;cour&s;e en&s;ued, and the conclu&s;ion of the farce was, that the&s;e demons had brought news from the God of Hochelaga, that his country was &s;o full of &s;now and ice, that whoever &s;hould adventure thither would peri&s;h with the cold. The artifice afforded diver&s;ion to the French, but
<PB N="168" REF="026637_0166_0FD10436F3CE5FF8">
was too thin to deceive them. Cartier de|termined to proceed; and on the 19th of September, with his pinnace and two boats, began his voyage up the river to Hochelaga.</P>
<P>Among the woods on the margin of the river were many vines loaded with ripe grapes, than which nothing could be a more welcome &s;ight to Frenchmen, though the fruit was not &s;o delicious as they had been u&s;ed to ta&s;te in their own country. Along the banks were many huts of the natives; who made &s;igns of joy as they pa&s;&s;ed; pre&s;ented them with fi&s;h; piloted them through narrow channels; car|ried them a&s;hore on their backs, and helped them to get off their boats when aground. Some pre&s;ented their children to them, and &s;uch as were of proper age were accepted.</P>
<P>The water at that time of the year being low, their pa&s;&s;age was rendered difficult; but by the friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the natives they &s;urmounted the ob&s;tructions. On the 28th of September they pa&s;&s;ed the rapids between the i&s;lands in the upper part of the lake An|gol&ecirc;me, (now called St. Peters) and on the &s;econd of October they arrived at the i&s;land of Hochelaga; where they had been expected, and preparations were made to give them a
<PB N="169" REF="026637_0167_0FD10439861C8788">
welcome reception. About a thou&s;and per|&s;ons came to meet them, &s;inging and dancing, the men on one &s;ide, the women on the other, and the children in a di&s;tinct body. Pre&s;ents of fi&s;h and other victuals were brought, and in return were given knives, beads and other trinkets. The Frenchmen lodged the fir&s;t night in their boats, and the natives watched on the &s;hore, dancing round their fires during the whole night.</P>
<P>The next morning Cartier, with twenty five of his company, went to vi&s;it the town, and were met on the way by a per&s;on of di&s;|tinction, who bad them welcome. To him they gave two hatchets and two knives, and hung over his neck a cro&s;s which they taught him to ki&s;s. As they proceeded, they pa&s;&s;ed through groves of oak, from which the acorns were fallen and lay thick on the ground. Af|ter this they came to fields of ripe corn, &s;ome of which was gathered. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e fields was &s;ituate the town of Hochelaga.</P>
<P>It was of a round form, encompa&s;&s;ed with three lines of pali&s;ades, through which was one entrance, well &s;ecured with &s;takes and bars. On the in&s;ide was a rampart of timber, to which were a&s;cents by ladders, and heaps
<PB N="170" REF="026637_0168_0FD1043CEFAD71C0">
of &s;tones were laid in proper places for defence. In the town were about fifty long huts built with &s;takes and covered with bark. In the mid|dle of each hut was a fire, round which were lodging places, floored with bark and covered with &s;kins. In the upper part was a &s;caffold, on which they dried and pre&s;erved their corn. To prepare it for eating, they pounded it in wooden mortars, and having mixed it with wa|ter, baked it on hot &s;tones. Be&s;ides corn they had beans, &s;qua&s;hes and pumpkins. They dried their fi&s;h and pre&s;erved them in troughs. The&s;e people lived chiefly by tillage and fi&s;h|ing, and &s;eldom went far from home. Tho&s;e on the lower parts of the river were more giv|en to hunting, and con&s;idered the Lord of Hochelaga as their &s;overeign, to whom they paid tribute.</P>
<P>When the new gue&s;ts were conducted to an open &s;quare in the centre of the town; the females came to them, rubbing their hands and faces, weeping with joy at their arrival, and bringing their children to be touched by the &s;trangers. They &s;pread mats for them on the ground, whil&s;t the men &s;eated them|&s;elves in a large circle on the out&s;ide. The King was then brought in a litter, on the
<PB N="171" REF="026637_0169_0FD1043F50E37898">
&s;houlders of ten men, and placed on a mat next to the French Captain. He was about fifty years old, and had no mark of di&s;tinction but a coronet made of porcupine's quills dyed red; which he took off and gave to the Cap|tain, reque&s;ting him to rub his arms and legs which were trembling with a pal&s;y. Several per&s;ons, blind, lame, and withered with age, were al&s;o brought to be touched; as if they &s;uppo&s;ed that their new gue&s;ts were me&s;&s;eng|ers from heaven inve&s;ted with a power of healing di&s;ea&s;es. Cartier gratified them as well as he could, by laying his hands on them and repeating &s;ome devotional pa&s;&s;ages from a &s;ervice book, which he had in his pocket; ac|companying his ejaculations with &s;ignificant ge&s;tures, and lifting up his eyes to heaven. The natives attentively ob&s;erved and imitated all his motions.</P>
<P>Having performed this ceremony, he de&s;ir|ed the men, women and children to arrange them&s;elves in &s;eparate bodies. To the men he gave hatchets, to the women beads, and to the children rings. He then ordered his drums and trumpets to &s;ound, which highly plea&s;ed the company and &s;et them to dancing.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="026637_0170_0FD1044193112638">Being de&s;irous of a&s;cending the hill, under which the town was built, the natives con|ducted them to the &s;ummit; where they were entertained with a mo&s;t exten&s;ive and beauti|ful pro&s;pect of mountains, woods, i&s;lands and waters. They ob&s;erved the cour&s;e of the riv|er above, and &s;ome falls of water in it; and the natives informed them that they might &s;ail on it for three months; that it ran through two or three great lakes, beyond which was a &s;ea of fre&s;h water, to which they knew of no bounds; and that on the other &s;ide of the mountains there was another river which ran in a contrary direction to the &s;outhwe&s;t, through a country full of delicious fruits and free from &s;now and ice; that there was found &s;uch metal as the Captain's <HI>&s;ilver</HI> whi&s;tle and the haft of a dagger belonging to one of the company which was gilt with <HI>gold.</HI> Being &s;hewn &s;ome copper, they pointed to the north|ward, and &s;aid it came from Saguenay. To this hill Cartier gave the name of <HI>Montreal,</HI> which it has ever &s;ince retained.</P>
<P>The vi&s;it being fini&s;hed, the natives accom|panied the French to their boats, carrying &s;uch as were weary on their &s;houlders. They were loth to part with their gue&s;ts, and fol|lowed

them along the &s;hore of the river to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the fourth of October, Cartier and his company departed from Hochelaga. In pa&s;&s;|ing down the river, they erected a cro&s;s on the point of an i&s;land, which, with three others, lay in the mouth of a &s;hallow river, on the north &s;ide, called Fouetz. On the eleventh they arrived at the Port de St. Croix, and found that their companions had enclo&s;ed the &s;hips with a pali&s;ade and rampart, on which they had mounted cannon.</P>
<P>The next day Donacona invited them to his re&s;idence, where they were entertained with the u&s;ual fe&s;tivity and made the cu&s;tom|ary pre&s;ents. They ob&s;erved that the&s;e peo|ple u&s;ed the leaves of an herb [tobacco] which they pre&s;erved in pouches made of &s;kins and &s;moked in &s;tone pipes. It was very offen&s;ive to the French; but the natives valued it as contributing much to the pre&s;ervation of their health. Their hou&s;es appeared to be well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions. Among other things which were new to the French, they ob&s;erved the &s;calps of five men, &s;pread and dri|ed like parchment. The&s;e were taken from their enemies the Toudamani, who came from
<PB N="174" REF="026637_0172_0FD104476BCD8428">
the &s;outh, and were continually at war with them.</P>
<P>Being determined to &s;pend the winter a|mong the&s;e friendly people, they traded with them for the provi&s;ions which they could &s;pare, and the river &s;upplied them with fi&s;h till it was hard frozen.</P>
<P>In December the &s;curvy began to make its appearance among the natives, and Cartier prohibited all intercour&s;e with them; but it was not long before his own men were taken with it. It raged with uncontroled violence for above two months, and by the middle of February, out of one hundred and ten per&s;ons, fifty were &s;ick at once, and eight or ten had died.</P>
<P>In this extremity Cartier appointed a day of &s;olemn humiliation and prayer. A crucifix was placed on a tree, and as many as were able to walk went in proce&s;&s;ion, through the ice and &s;now, &s;inging the &s;even penitential p&s;alms and performing other devotional exerci&s;es. At the clo&s;e of the &s;olemnity Cartier made a vow, that "if it would plea&s;e God to permit him to return to France, he would go in pilgrim|age to our Lady of Roquemado." But it was nece&s;&s;ary to watch as well as pray. To pre|vent
<PB N="175" REF="026637_0173_0FD1044C010AC110">
the natives from knowing their weak and defencele&s;s &s;tate, he obliged all who were able, to make as much noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible with axes and hammers; and told the natives that his men were all bu&s;ily employed, and that he would not &s;uffer any of them to go from the &s;hips till their work was done. The &s;hips were fa&s;t frozen up from the middle of No|vember to the middle of March; the &s;now was four feet deep, and higher than the &s;ides of the &s;hips above the ice. The &s;everity of the winter exceeded all which they had ever experienced; the &s;curvy &s;till raged; twenty five men had fallen victims to it, and the others were &s;o weak and low in &s;pirits, that they de&s;paired of ever &s;eeing their native country.</P>
<P>In the depth of this di&s;tre&s;s and de&s;pon|dency, Cartier, who had e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e, in walking one day on the ice, met &s;ome of the natives, among whom was Domagaia, one of the young men who had been with him to France and who then re&s;ided with his coun|trymen at Stadacona. He had been &s;ick with the &s;curvy, his &s;inews had been &s;hrunk and his knees &s;wollen, his teeth loo&s;e, and his gums rotten; but he was then recovered,
<PB N="176" REF="026637_0174_0FD104511E4D81E0">
and told Cartier of a certain tree, the leaves and bark of which he had u&s;ed as a remedy. Cartier expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;h to &s;ee the tree; tel|ling him that <HI>one</HI> of his people had been affect|ed with the &s;ame di&s;order. Two women were immediately di&s;patched, who brought ten or twelve branches, and &s;howed him how to pre|pare the decoction; which was thus, "to boil the bark and the leaves; to drink of the liquor every other day; and to put the dregs on the legs of the &s;ick."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This tree was called by the natives Ameda or Haneda. Mr. Hakluyt &s;uppo&s;es it to have been the Sa&s;&s;afras; but as the leaves were u&s;ed with the bark, in the winter, it mu&s;t have been an ever|green. The dregs of the bark were al&s;o applied to the &s;ore legs of the patient. From the&s;e circum&s;tances I am inclined to think that it was the &s;pruce pine <HI>(pinus canaden&s;is)</HI> which is u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner by the Indians, and &s;uch as have learned of them. Spruce beer is well known to be a powerful anti&s;corbutic: and the bark of this and of the white pine &s;erves as a catapla&s;m for wounds and &s;ores.</NOTE></P>
<P>This remedy pre&s;ently came into u&s;e, on board the &s;hips; and its good effects were &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, that within one week they were completely healed of the &s;curvy; and &s;ome who had venereal complaints of long &s;tanding were al&s;o cured by the &s;ame means.</P>
<P>The &s;everity of winter having continued four months without intermi&s;&s;ion, at the re|turn
<PB N="177" REF="026637_0175_0FD10455424D0510">
of the &s;un, the &s;ea&s;on became milder, and in April the ice began to break up. On the third of May, Cartier took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country by erecting a cro&s;s, thirty five feet high, on which was hung a &s;hield, bear|ing the arms of France, with this in&s;cription: FRANCISCUS <HI>primus, Dei grati&acirc;,</HI> FRANCO|RUM <HI>Rex, regnat.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame day, being a day of fe&s;tivity, the two young &s;avages, Taignoagni and Domagaia, with Donacona the chief of the place, came on board the &s;hips; and were partly prevailed on and partly con&s;trained to accompany Cartier to France. A hand&s;ome pre&s;ent was made to the Family of Donacona, but it was with great reluctance that his friends parted with him; though Cartier promi&s;ed to bring him again at the end of twelve months. On the &s;ixth of May they &s;ailed from the Port of St. Croix; and having touched at St. Peter's in Newfoundland, they arrived at St. Malo in France the &s;ixth of July 1536.</P>
<P>Whether Cartier performed his vow to God, the hi&s;tory does not tell us; certain it is, however, that he did not perform his promi&s;e to his pa&s;&s;engers. The zeal for adventures of this kind began to abate. Neither gold nor
<PB N="178" REF="026637_0176_0FD104579266EC18">
&s;ilver were carried home. The advantages of the fur trade were not fully under&s;tood; and the pro&s;pect of benefit from cultivation in the &s;hort &s;ummer of that cold climate, was great|ly overbalanced, by the length and &s;everity of a Canadian winter. The natives had been &s;o often told of the nece&s;&s;ity of bapti&s;m in or|der to &s;alvation, that on their arrival in France, they were at their own reque&s;t baptized; but neither of them lived to &s;ee their native land again.</P>
<P>The report which Cartier brought home, of the fine country beyond the Lakes, had however made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of &s;ome, that, at the end of four years, another expedition was projected. Francis de la Roche, Lord of Roberval, was commi&s;|&s;ioned by the King as his Lieutenant Govern|or in Canada and Hockelaga; and Cartier was appointed his pilot, with the command of five &s;hips. When they were ready to &s;ail, Roberval had not fini&s;hed his preparations, and was therefore detained. The King's or|ders to Cartier being po&s;itive, he &s;ailed from St. Malo on the 23d of May 1540.</P>
<P>The winds were adver&s;e and the voyage te|dious. The &s;hips were &s;cattered, and did not
<PB N="179" REF="026637_0177_0FD104588924F140">
arrive at the place of their de&s;tination till the 23d of Augu&s;t; when they came to the port of St. Croix in the river of Canada.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t inquiry made by the natives was for their countrymen who had been carried away. The an&s;wer was, that Donacona was dead, and that the others had become great Lords, were married in France, and refu&s;ed to return. Neither &s;orrow nor re&s;entment were &s;hown on this occa&s;ion; but a &s;ecret jealou|&s;y, which had long been working, received &s;trength, from an an&s;wer &s;o liable to &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this voyage being imperfect, it is not po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, in what particular manner this jealou&s;y operated. Cartier made another excur&s;ion, up the river; and pitched on a place about four leagues above St. Croix to lay up three of his ve&s;&s;els for the winter. The other two he &s;ent back to France, to in|form the King of what they had done; and that Roberval had not arrived.</P>
<P>At the new harbour, which he had cho&s;en for his &s;hips, was a &s;mall river, running in a &s;erpentine cour&s;e to the &s;outh. On the ea&s;t|ern &s;ide of its entrance was a high and &s;teep cliff; on the top of which, they built a fort and called it Charleburg. Below, the &s;hips
<PB N="180" REF="026637_0178_0FD1045ACFA8E558">
were drawn up and fortified, as they had been in the former winter which he &s;pent here. Not far from the fort were &s;ome rocks containing chry&s;tals; which they denominat|ed diamonds; and on the &s;hore were picked up certain &s;pecks of a yellow &s;ub&s;tance, which their imaginations refined into gold. Iron ore was found in abundance; and a kind of black &s;late, with veins of an apparent metallic &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>In what manner they pa&s;&s;ed the winter, the defective accounts which we have do not in|form us. In the &s;pring of the following year, Cartier and his company having heard noth|ing of Roberval; and concluding that they were abandoned by their friends and expo&s;ed to peri&s;h in a climate the mo&s;t &s;evere, and a|mong people who&s;e conduct toward them, was totally changed, determined to return to France. Accordingly having &s;et &s;ail, at the breaking up of the ice, they arrived in the harbour of St. John in Newfoundland, &s;ome|time in June; where they met Roberval, who, with three &s;hips and two hundred per|&s;ons, male and female, had &s;ailed from Rochelle in April; and were on their way to e&s;tabli&s;h a colony in Canada. Cartier went on board
<PB N="181" REF="026637_0179_0FD1045E6B509B98">
Roberval's &s;hip, and &s;howed him the dia|monds and gold which he had found; but told him that the ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition of the natives had obliged him to quit the country; which however he repre&s;ented to him as ca|pable of profitable cultivation. Roberval ordered him to return to Canada; but Car|tier privately &s;ailed out of the harbour in the night and pur&s;ued his voyage to France.</P>
<P>Mortified and di&s;appointed, Roberval con|tinued &s;ome time longer at St. John's before he proceeded, and about the end of July ar|rived at the place which Cartier had quitted. There he erected a fort on a commanding eminence, and another at its foot; in which were depo&s;ited all the provi&s;ion, ammunition, artillery, implements of hu&s;bandry and other materials for the intended colony.</P>
<P>In September, two ve&s;&s;els were &s;ent back to France, to carry &s;pecimens of chry&s;tal, and fetch provi&s;ions for the next year; the &s;tores which they had brought being much reduced. By the help of the fi&s;h which they took in the river, and the game which they procured from the &s;avages; and by well hu&s;|banding their provi&s;ions, they lingered out a tedious winter, having &s;uffered much from
<PB N="182" REF="026637_0180_0FD10460874684B0">
the &s;curvy, of which about fifty of them died. In addition to this di&s;tre&s;s, Roberval exer|ci&s;ed &s;uch &s;everity in his government, that one man was hanged, &s;everal were laid in irons, and &s;ome of both &s;exes underwent the di&s;cipline of the whip.</P>
<P>In April the ice began to break up; and on the fifth of June he proceeded up the riv|er; leaving De Royeze, his Lieutenant, to command in his ab&s;ence, with orders to em|bark for France, if he &s;hould not return by the middle of July.</P>
<P>As the account of the expedition ends here, we can only remark that the colony was broken up; and no farther attempt was made by the French to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in Can|ada, till after the expiration of half a century. The la&s;t account of Roberval is that, in 1549, he &s;ailed with his brother on &s;ome voyage of di&s;covery, and never returned.</P>
<P>In this fir&s;t vi&s;it, which the natives of Can|ada received from the Europeans, we have a &s;triking in&s;tance of their primitive manners. Su&s;pecting no danger, and influenced by no fear, they embraced the &s;tranger with unaf|fected joy. Their huts were open to receive him, their fires and furs to give warmth and
<PB N="183" REF="026637_0181_0FD104650643CA50">
re&s;t to his weary limbs; their food was &s;har|ed with him or given in exchange for his tri|fles; they were ready with their &s;imple med|icines to heal his di&s;ea&s;es and his wounds; they would wade through rivers and climb rocks and mountains to guide him in his way, and they would remember and requite his kind|ne&s;s more than it de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Unhappily for them they &s;et too high a value on their new gue&s;t. Imagining him to be of a heavenly origin, they were extrava|gant and unguarded in their fir&s;t attachment, and from &s;ome &s;pecimens of his &s;uperiority, obvious to their &s;en&s;es, they expected more than ought ever to be expected from beings of the &s;ame &s;pecies. But when the mi&s;take was di&s;covered, and the &s;tranger whom they had adored, proved to be no more than human, having the &s;ame inferior de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions with them&s;elves; e&s;pecially when they found their confidence mi&s;placed and their generous friend&s;hip ill requited; then the rage of jea|lou&s;y extingui&s;hed the virtue of benevolence; and they &s;truggled to rid them&s;elves of him, as an enemy, whom they had received into their bo&s;om as a friend.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="026637_0182_0FD10467F41995E0">On the other hand, it was too common for the European adventurer, to regard the man of nature as an inferior being; and whil&s;t he availed him&s;elf of his &s;trength and experience, to abu&s;e his confidence, and repay his kindne&s;s with in&s;ult and injury; to &s;tigmatize him as a heathen and a &s;avage, and to be&s;tow on him the epithets of deceitful, treacherous, and cruel; though he him&s;elf had fir&s;t &s;et the example of the&s;e dete&s;table vices.</P>

<HEAD>VII. FERDINANDO DE SOTO.</HEAD>
<P>THE travels and tran&s;actions of this adventurer are of &s;o little importance in the hi&s;tory of America that I &s;hould not have thought them worthy of much notice; had it not been, that &s;ome gentlemen of ingenuity and learning, have had recour&s;e to the expedi|tion of this Spaniard as a means of &s;olving the que&s;tion re&s;pecting the mounds and fortifica|tions, of a regular con&s;truction, which within a few years pa&s;t have been di&s;covered in the thicke&s;t &s;hades of the American fore&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the reader wi&s;hes to &s;ee a particular inve&s;tigation of this hypothe&s;is, he may con&s;ult the American Magazine, printed at New York, for December 1787, January and February 1788, and &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent numbers; compared with the Columbian Mag|azine, printed at Philadelphia, for September and November 1788.</NOTE> Though the opinion &s;eems to have been can|didly given up by one of the writers who at|tempted to defend it; yet, as what was publi&s;h|ed on the &s;ubject may have impre&s;&s;ed &s;ome per&s;ons with an idea that the&s;e works were of European fabric, I &s;hall briefly relate the hi&s;tory of Soto's march; and the difficulties which
<PB N="186" REF="026637_0184_0FD1046BED7A5198">
attend the &s;uppo&s;ition that he was the builder of any of the&s;e fortifications.</P>
<P>After the conque&s;t of Mexico and Peru, in the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, the inextingui&s;hable thir&s;t for gold, which had &s;eized the Spani&s;h adventurers, prompted them to &s;earch for that bewitching metal wherever there could be any pro&s;pect of finding it. Three un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts had been made in Florida, by Ponce, Gomez, and Narvaez; but becau&s;e the&s;e adventurers did not penetrate the interior parts of the continent; FERDINAN|DO DE SOTO, Governour of Cuba, who had been a companion of the Pizarros in their Peruvian expedition, and had there ama&s;&s;ed much wealth, projected a march into Florida, of which country he had the title of Adelan|tado, or Pre&s;ident. He &s;ailed from the Port of Havannah May 18, 1539, with nine ve&s;&s;els, &s;ix hundred men,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Prince's Chronology it is &s;aid that Soto had 900 men, but he quotes Purchas for his authority, in who&s;e book the number is "<HI>&s;ix hundred.</HI>"</NOTE> two hundred and thirteen hor&s;es, and a heard of &s;wine, and arrived on the 30th of the &s;ame month in the bay of E&s;piri|tu Santo, on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of the penin&s;ula of Florida.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="026637_0185_0FD1046E95306488">Being a &s;oldier of fortune and determined on conque&s;t, he immediately pitched his camp and &s;ecured it. A foraging party met with a few Indians who re&s;i&s;ted them; two were killed, the others e&s;caped, and reported to their countrymen that the <HI>warriors of fire</HI> had invaded their territories; upon which the &s;maller towns were de&s;erted and the natives hid in the woods.</P>
<P>Having met with a Spaniard of the party of Narvaez, who had been wrecked on the coa&s;t, and had been twelve years a captive with the Indians, Soto made u&s;e of him as a me&s;|&s;enger to them to inquire for gold and &s;ilver; and wherever he could receive any informa|tion re&s;pecting the&s;e precious metals thither he directed his march.</P>
<P>His manner of marching was this: The hor&s;emen carried bags of corn and other pro|vi&s;ions; the footmen marched by the &s;ide of the hor&s;es, and the &s;wine were driven be|fore them. When they fir&s;t landed they had thirteen female &s;wine, which in two years in|crea&s;ed to &s;everal hundreds; the warmth of the climate being favourable to their propaga|tion, and the fore&s;ts yielding them a plenty of food.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="026637_0186_0FD10470C6602420">The fir&s;t &s;ummer and winter were &s;pent in the penin&s;ula of Florida, not far from the bay of Apalache; and in the beginning of the following &s;pring, having &s;ent back his ve&s;&s;els to Cuba for &s;upplies, and left a part of his men at the port, where he expected the &s;hips to return, he marched toward the north and ea&s;t, in &s;earch of a place called Yupaha, where he had been informed there was gold.</P>
<P>In this march he cro&s;&s;ed the river Altama|ha and probably the Ogechee, and came, as he was informed, within two days journey of the bay of St. Helena, where the Spaniards had been &s;everal years before. In all this march he &s;taid not more than a week in any one place.</P>
<P>He then &s;et his face <HI>northward,</HI> and having pa&s;&s;ed a hilly country, came to a di&s;trict called Chalaque, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the coun|try now called Cherokee, on the upper branch|es of the river Savannah. Thence he turned <HI>we&s;tward,</HI> in &s;earch of a place called Chiaha, and in this route he cro&s;&s;ed the Allegany ridge, and came to Chiaha, where his hor&s;es and men, being exce&s;&s;ively fatigued, he re&s;ted thirty days. The hor&s;es fed in a meadow, and and the people lay under the trees, the weath|er
<PB N="189" REF="026637_0187_0FD104728C15BC18">
being very hot, and the natives in peace. This was in the months of May and June. During their abode there they heard of a country called Chi&s;ca, where was copper and another metal of the &s;ame colour. This coun|try lay <HI>northward,</HI> and a party was &s;ent with Indian guides to view it. Their report was, that the mountains were impa&s;&s;able, and Soto did not attempt to proceed any farther in that direction.</P>
<P>From a careful in&s;pection of the maps in the American Atlas, I am inclined to think that the place where Soto cro&s;&s;ed the moun|tains was within the thirty fifth degree of lat|itude. In Deli&s;le's map, a village called Ca|na&s;aga, is laid down on the N. W. &s;ide of the Allegany (or as it is &s;ometimes called) the Apalachian ridge of mountains, in that lati|tude; and Chiaha is &s;aid in Soto's journal to be five days we&s;tward from Cana&s;agua.</P>
<P>To a&s;certain the &s;ituation of Chiaha we mu&s;t ob&s;erve that it is &s;aid to be &s;ubject to the Lord of Co&s;a, which is &s;ituate on an ea&s;t|ern branch of the Mobille; and Soto's &s;ick men came <HI>down</HI> the river from Chiaha in boats. This river could be none but a branch of the Mobille; and his cour&s;e was then
<PB N="190" REF="026637_0188_0FD0F97B30D622E0">
turned toward the <HI>&s;outh.</HI> In this march he pa&s;&s;ed through Alibama, Tali&s;e, Ta&s;calu&s;a, names which are &s;till known and marked on the maps, till he came to the town of Mavil|la, which the French pronounced Mouville and Mabille. It was then a walled town, but the walls were of wood. The inhabitants had conceived a di&s;gu&s;t to the Spaniards, which was augmented by an outrage commit|ted on one of their Chiefs, and finally broke out in a &s;evere conflict, in which two thou&s;and of the innocent natives were &s;lain, and many of the Spaniards killed and wounded, and the town was burnt. This was in the latter end of October.</P>
<P>It is probable that Soto intended to pa&s;s the winter in the neighbourhood of that vil|lage, if he could have kept on friendly terms with the Indians; for there he could have had a communication with Cuba. There he heard that the ve&s;&s;els which he had &s;ent to Cuba for &s;upplies were arrived at Ochus [Pen&s;acola] where he had agreed to meet them; but he kept this information &s;e|cret, becau&s;e he had not yet made any di&s;|coveries which his Spani&s;h friends would think worthy of regard. The country
<PB N="191" REF="026637_0189_0FD10476DBB80DD8">
about him was populous and ho&s;tile, and, being void of gold or &s;ilver, was not an ob|ject for him to po&s;&s;e&s;s at the ri&s;que of lo&s;ing his army, of which above an hundred had already peri&s;hed. He therefore, after &s;tay|ing twenty eight days for the recovery of his wounded, determined on a retreat.</P>
<P>In this retreat it has been &s;uppo&s;ed that he penetrated northward, beyond the Ohio. The truth is, that he began his march from Mavilla, a village near the mouth of the Mobille, on the 18th of November, and on the 17th of December arrived at Chica&ccedil;ca, an Indian village of twenty hou&s;es, where they remained till the next April.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance, the time, the nature of the country, the cour&s;e and manner of the march, and the name of the village, all con|cur to determine this winter &s;tation of Soto to be a village of the <HI>Chicke&s;aw</HI> Indians, &s;it|uate on the upper part of the Ya&s;ou, a branch of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, about eighty leagues northwe&s;tward from Mobille, and not le&s;s than one hundred and forty leagues, &s;outh|we&s;tward from the Mu&s;kingum, where the great fortifications, which gave ri&s;e to this inquiry, are found. From <HI>Chica&ccedil;a,</HI> in the
<PB N="192" REF="026637_0190_0FD10479F8FFB490">
&s;pring, he went we&s;tward, and cro&s;&s;ed a river within the thirty fourth degree of latitude, which he called Rio Grande, and which is now known to be the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.</P>
<P>On the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, af|ter rambling all &s;ummer, he &s;pent the next winter, at a place called Autiamque, where he enclo&s;ed his camp with a wall of timber, the work of three days only. Within this enclo&s;ure he lodged &s;afely during three months; and, in the &s;ucceeding &s;pring, the extreme fatigue and anxiety which he had &s;uffered, threw him into a fever, of which he died, May 21, 1542, at Guacoya. To prevent his death from being known to the Indians, his body was &s;unk in the middle of a river.</P>
<P>His Lieutenant, Louis de Mo&s;co&s;co, con|tinued to ramble on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, till the next &s;ummer; when worn with fatigue, di&s;appointment, and lo&s;s of men, he built &s;even boats, called brigantines, on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, in which, the &s;hattered remnants, con&s;i&s;ting of three hundrd and eleven, return|ed to Cuba, in September 1543.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas, vol. v. p. 1532 to 1556.</NOTE></P>
<P>The place where Soto died is &s;aid to have been on the bank of the Red river, a we&s;tern

<P>From this account, faithfully abridged from Purchas and compared with the be&s;t maps, I am fully per&s;uaded that the whole country through which Soto travelled on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi is comprehended with|in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina; and that he never went farther northward than the 35th degree of latitude, which is di&s;tant two degrees &s;outhward from any part of the Ohio. The conclu&s;ion then is, that he could not have been the builder of tho&s;e fortifica|tions, &s;till remaining in that part of the con|tinent, which lies N. W. of the Ohio. Nor indeed can any works which he erected for the &s;ecurity of his camp be &s;ub&s;i&s;ting at this time; for the be&s;t of them were made of wood, and were intended to cover his men; and protect his hor&s;es and &s;wine, only during one winter.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="026637_0192_0FD1047D4AAD8158">The works which have &s;o much excited curio&s;ity and conjecture, are far more numer|ous, exten&s;ive and durable. They are found in various and di&s;tant places, in the interior part of the continent, on both &s;ides of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; on the Ohio and its branches; on James and Potowmack rivers in Virginia; in the country of the Six Nations, and on the &s;hores of lake Erie; where they are exceed|ingly numerous.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t obvious mode of &s;olving the que&s;tion re&s;pecting them, is by inquiry of the pre&s;ent natives. But the &s;tructures are too ancient for their tradition; the olde&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men know nothing of their original. The form and materials of the&s;e works, indi|cate the exi&s;tence of a race of men &s;uperior to the pre&s;ent race, in improvement, in de&s;ign, and in that patience which mu&s;t have accom|panied the labour of erecting them.</P>
<P>Trees which have been found growing on them have been cut down, and, from indubi|table marks, are known to have been upwards of three hundred years old; nor were the&s;e the fir&s;t growth, upon them.</P>
<P>The mounds and ramparts are con&s;tructed of earth, and have acquired a firmne&s;s and &s;ol|idity,

which render it probable that they are the work of &s;ome remote age and &s;ome other people; who had different ideas of conveni|ence and were better acquainted with the arts of defence; and in fact, were much more nu|merous than the ance&s;try of tho&s;e natives, of whom we or our fathers have had any knowledge.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped that the per&s;ons who now occupy and are cultivating the lands where the&s;e &s;ingular buildings are found, will pre|&s;erve, as far as they are able, &s;ome, at lea&s;t, of the&s;e monuments of unknown ages; that as they have long re&s;i&s;ted the ravages of time, and may po&s;&s;ibly baffle the re&s;earches of the pre&s;ent generation, they may &s;ub&s;i&s;t unimpair|ed as &s;ubjects of &s;peculation to our po&s;terity.</P>

<HEAD>VIII. HUMPHREY GILBERT.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the di&s;covery of Newfound|land by the Cabots, the pa&s;&s;ion for adventure, among the Engli&s;h, met with many &s;evere checks. But whil&s;t one adventurer after a|nother was returning home from an un&s;uc|ce&s;sful voyage, intended to penetrate unknown &s;eas to China; foreigners were reaping the benefit of their partial di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>Within the fir&s;t forty years, we have no ac|count of any attempt made by the Engli&s;h to pro&s;ecute the di&s;covery of the new continent, except, that in 1536, two ve&s;&s;els containing one hundred and twenty per&s;ons, of whom thirty were gentlemen of education and cha|racter, under the conduct of "Ma&s;ter Hore of London" made a voyage to Newfound|land;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hakluyt, vol. iii. p. 130.</NOTE> but they were &s;o ill provided, and knew &s;o little of the nature of the country, that they &s;uffered the extremity of famine. For, notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e quantities of fi&s;h and fowl to be found on tho&s;e coa&s;ts; they were reduced &s;o low as to watch the ne&s;ts of birds of prey and rob them of the fi&s;h
<PB N="197" REF="026637_0195_0FD10482C6A1AD78">
which they brought to feed their young. To collect this &s;canty &s;upply, with a mixture of roots and herbs, the men di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves in the woods, until &s;everal of them were mi&s;&s;|ing. It was at fir&s;t thought that they were devoured by wild bea&s;ts; but it was found that they met with a more tragical fate; the &s;tronger having killed the weaker and fea&s;ted on their fle&s;h. In the mid&s;t of this di&s;tre&s;s, a French &s;hip arriving with a &s;upply of provi|&s;ions, they took her by force, and returned to England; leaving to the Frenchmen their own &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, and dividing the provi&s;ion be|tween them. Complaint of this act of piracy was made to King HENRY VIII: who, knowing the mi&s;eries of the unfortunate crew, in&s;tead of puni&s;hing them, paid the damage out of his own coffers.</P>
<P>Within the &s;ucceeding forty years, the Engli&s;h had begun to make &s;ome advantage by the fi&s;hery; and in 1578, the &s;tate of it is thus de&s;cribed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter of Anthony Parkhur&s;t to Richard Hakluyt, vol. iii, p. 132.</NOTE> "There are about one hun|dred &s;ail of Spaniards who come to take cod; who make it all wet, and dry it when they come home; be&s;ides twenty or thirty more, who come from Bi&s;cay to kill whales for train.

Of Portugals, there are not above fifty &s;ail, who&s;e tonnage may amount to three thou&s;and, and they make all wet. Of the French na|tion are about one hundred and fifty &s;ail; the mo&s;t of their &s;hipping is very &s;mall, not pa&s;t forty tons; among which &s;ome are great and rea&s;onably well appointed; better than the Portugals, and not &s;o well as the Spaniards; the burden of them may be about &s;even thou|&s;and.

<P>The next year [1579] Queen Elizabeth granted to Sir HUMPHREY GILBERT, a pa|tent for the di&s;covering, occupying and peop|ling of "&s;uch remote, heathen and barbarous countries as were not actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> people."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hakluyt iii.135.

preparations were made for an expedition, which promi&s;ed to be highly advantageous. But before the fleet was ready, &s;ome declined and retracted their engagements. Gilbert, with a few companions, &s;ailed; but a violent &s;torm, in which one of the &s;hips foundered, cau&s;ed him to return. This misfortune in|volved him in debt; and he had no way to &s;atisfy the demands of his creditors, but by grants of land in America. By &s;uch means, the country was not likely to be peopled, nor the conditions of his patent fulfilled. He was obliged therefore to &s;ell his e&s;tate before he could make another attempt; and, after long &s;olicitation, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome friends, he &s;et &s;ail from Plymouth with five &s;hips, carrying two hundred and &s;ixty men, on the eleventh of June 1583; and on the eleventh of July arrived off the bay of St. John, on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Newfoundland.</P>
<P>Thirty &s;ix fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els were then in the harbour, who refu&s;ed him admittance.

<P><PB N="200" REF="026637_0198_0FD10543DCC51CC0">The intention of this voyage was to take formal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land, and of the fi&s;h|ery on its banks, for the crown of England. This was done in the following manner:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hakluyt iii, 151, 165.</NOTE></P>
<P>On Monday the fifth of Augu&s;t, Admiral Gilbert had his tent pitched on &s;hore, in &s;ight of all the &s;hipping; and being attended by his own people, &s;ummoned the merchants and ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els, both Engli&s;hmen and oth|ers, to be pre&s;ent at the ceremony. When they were all a&s;&s;embled, his commi&s;&s;ion was read, and interpreted to the foreigners. Then a turf and a twig were delivered to him, which he received with a hazle wand. Immediately, proclamation was made, that by virtue of his commi&s;&s;ion from the Queen, he took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, for the crown of England, of the har|bour of St. John, and two hundred leagues every way round it.</P>
<P>He then publi&s;hed three laws, for the gov|ernment of the territory. By the fir&s;t, pub|lic wor&s;hip was e&s;tabli&s;hed according to the mode of the church of England. By the &s;ec|ond, the attempting of any thing prejudicial to her Maje&s;ty's title was declared trea&s;on, ac|cording to the laws of England. By the
<PB N="201" REF="026637_0199_0FD0F98C8ACF78A8">
third, the uttering of words, to the di&s;honour of her Maje&s;ty, was to be puni&s;hed with the lo&s;s of ears and the confi&s;cation of property.</P>
<P>The proclamation being fini&s;hed, a&s;&s;ent and obedience were &s;ignified by loud acclama|tions. A pillar was erected, bearing a plate of lead, on which the Queen's arms were en|graven; and &s;everal of the merchants took grants of land, in fee farm, on which they might cure their fi&s;h, as they had done be|fore.</P>
<P>A tax of provi&s;ion, by her Maje&s;ty's autho|rity, was levied on all the &s;hips. This tax was readily paid; be&s;ides which, the Admiral received pre&s;ents of wine, fruit, and other re|fre&s;hments, chiefly from the Portugue&s;e.</P>
<P>This formal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, taken by Sir Hum|phrey Gilbert, in con&s;equence of the di&s;cov|ery by the Cabots, is the foundation of the right and title of the crown of England to the territory of Newfoundland and to the fi&s;hery on its banks.</P>
<P>As far as the time would permit, a &s;urvey was made of the country; one principal ob|ject of which was the di&s;covery of mines and minerals. The mineralogi&s;t was a Saxon, who is characterized as "hone&s;t and religious."
<PB N="202" REF="026637_0200_0FD0F98DFA620798">
This man brought to the Admiral fir&s;t a &s;pe|cimen of iron, then a kind of ore, which, on the peril of his life, he prote&s;ted to be &s;ilver. The Admiral enjoined &s;ecrecy, and &s;ent it on board; intending to have it a&s;&s;ayed, when they &s;hould get to &s;ea.</P>
<P>The company being di&s;per&s;ed abroad, &s;ome were taken &s;ick and died; &s;ome hid them&s;elves in the woods, with an intention to go home, by the fir&s;t opportunity; and others cut one of the ve&s;&s;els out of the harbour and carried her off.</P>
<P>On the twentieth of Augu&s;t, the Admiral, having collected as many of his men as could be found, and ordered one of his ve&s;&s;els to &s;tay and take off the &s;ick, &s;et &s;ail with three &s;hips; the Delight, the Hind, and the Squir|rel. He coa&s;ted along the &s;outhern part of the i&s;land, with a view to make Cape Breton and the I&s;le of Sable; on which la&s;t, he had heard that cattle and &s;wine had been landed by the Portugue&s;e, thirty years before.</P>
<P>Being entangled among &s;hoals and involved in fogs, the Delight &s;truck on a &s;and bank and was lo&s;t. Fourteen men only &s;aved them|&s;elves in a boat; the lo&s;s of the Saxon refiner was particularly noted, and nothing farther
<PB N="203" REF="026637_0201_0FD0F99A75310CD8">
was heard of the &s;ilver ore. This misfortune determined the Admiral to return to Eng|land, without attempting to make any farther di&s;coveries, or to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any other part of America. On his pa&s;&s;age, he met with bad weather. The Squirrel frigate, in which Sir Humphrey &s;ailed, was overloaded on her deck; but he per&s;i&s;ted in taking his pa&s;&s;age in her, notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of his friends, in the Hind, who would have per|&s;uaded him to &s;ail with them. From the circum&s;tance of his returning from his fir&s;t voyage without accompli&s;hing its object, it had been reported that he was afraid of the &s;ea; had he yielded to the &s;olicitation of his friends, the &s;tigma might have been indelible.</P>
<P>When the wind abated, and the ve&s;&s;els were near enough, the Admiral was &s;een con&s;tantly &s;itting in the &s;tern with a book in his hand. On the ninth of September, he was &s;een for the la&s;t time; and was heard by the people in the Hind to &s;ay, "We are as near heaven by &s;ea as by land." In the following night, the lights of his &s;hip &s;uddenly di&s;appeared. The people in the other ve&s;&s;el kept a good look out for him, during the remainder of the voyage. On the twenty &s;econd of September,
<PB N="204" REF="026637_0202_0FD0F9C50D39A2A8">
they arrived, through much tempe&s;t and peril, at Falmouth. But nothing more was &s;een or heard of the Admiral.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t his zeal for the intere&s;t of the Crown, and the &s;ettlement of its American dominions, has been largely commended; he has been blamed for his temerity in lavi&s;hing his own and other men's fortunes in the pro&s;|ecution of his de&s;igns. This is not the only in&s;tance of a wa&s;te of property in con&s;equence of &s;anguine expectations; which, though ruin|ous to the fir&s;t adventurers, has produced &s;olid advantages to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Dr. For&s;ter has a remark on one of the in|cidents of this voyage which is worthy of re|petition and remembrance. "It is very clear (&s;ays he) in the in&s;tance of the Portugue&s;e having &s;tocked the I&s;le of Sable with dome&s;tic animals, that the di&s;coverers of the new world were men of humanity; de&s;irous of provid|ing for &s;uch unfortunate people as might hap|pen to be ca&s;t away on tho&s;e coa&s;ts. The fal&s;e policy of modern times is callous and tyrannical, exporting dogs to devour them. Are the&s;e the happy con&s;equences of the &s;o much boa&s;ted enlightened &s;tate of the pre&s;ent

<P>THE di&s;tingui&s;hed figure, which the life of Sir Walter Raleigh makes in the hi&s;|tory of England, renders unnece&s;&s;ary any oth|er account of him here, than what re&s;pects his adventures in America; and particularly in Virginia; of which colony he is acknow|ledged to have been the unfortunate founder.</P>
<P>He was half brother, by the mother's &s;ide, to Sir Humphry Gilbert, and was at the ex|pen&s;e of fitting out one of the &s;hips of his &s;quadron. Notwith&s;tanding the unhappy fate of his brother, he per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign of making a &s;ettlement in America.

<P>They took the u&s;ual route by the way of the Canaries and the We&s;t Indies; the rea&s;on of which is thus expre&s;&s;ed in the account of this voyage written by Barlow<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hakluyt, iii, 246.</NOTE>, "becau&s;e we doubted that the current of the bay of Mexico between the cape of Florida and Ha|vanna had been of greater force than we after|wards found it to be."</P>

At the fir&s;t opening, they ca&s;t an|chor (July 13) and having devoutly given thanks to GOD, for their &s;afe arrival on the coa&s;t, they went a&s;hore in their boats, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the name of Queen Eliza|beth.</P>
<P>The place where they landed was a &s;andy i&s;land, called Wococon,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This i&s;land is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of tho&s;e which lie at the mouth of Albermarle &s;ound, on the coa&s;t of North Carolina.

One of them landed; and, without any fear or pre|caution, met the Europeans and addre&s;&s;ed them in a friendly manner, in his own language. They carried him on board one of their ve&s;|&s;els; gave him a &s;hirt and &s;ome other trifles, and regaled him with meat and wine. He then returned to his canoe; and with his com|panions went a fi&s;hing.

<P>The next day, &s;everal canoes came; in which were forty or fifty people, and among them was Granganimeo, brother of Wingina King of the country; who was confined at home by the wounds, which he had received in battle, with a neighbouring Prince. The manner of his approach was fearle&s;s and re&s;|pectful. He left his boats at a di&s;tance; and came along the &s;hore, accompanied by all his people, till he was abrea&s;t of the &s;hips. Then advancing with four men only, who &s;pread a mat on the ground, he &s;at down on one end; and the four men on the other. When the Engli&s;h went on &s;hore, armed, he beckoned

None of his people &s;poke a word; and when the Engli&s;h offered them pre&s;ents, he took them all into his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; making &s;igns that they were his &s;ervants, and that all which they had, belonged to him.</P>
<P>After this interview, the natives came in great numbers and brought &s;kins, coral, and materials for dyes; but when Granganimeo was pre&s;ent, none were permitted to trade, but him&s;elf and tho&s;e who had a piece of cop|per on their heads. Nothing plea&s;ed him &s;o much as a tin plate, in which he made a hole and hung it over his brea&s;t, as a piece of defen&s;ive armour.

For the&s;e purpo&s;es, Sir Walter Raleigh had &s;ent John Withe, an ingenious painter; and Thomas Heriot, a &s;kilful mathematician, and a man of curious ob&s;ervation: both of whom

<P>The farthe&s;t di&s;covery which they made to the &s;outhward of Roanoke was Secotan, an Indian town between the rivers of Pamptico and Neus, di&s;tant eighty leagues. To the northward they went about forty leagues, to a nation called Che&s;epeags, on a &s;mall river now called Eli&s;abeth, which falls into Che&s;e|peag Bay, below Norfolk. To the we&s;tward they went up Albemarle Sound and Chowan river, about forty leagues, to a nation called Chowanogs; who&s;e King, Menatonona, amu&s;ed them with a &s;tory of a copper mine and a pearl fi&s;hery; in &s;earch of which they &s;pent much time and &s;o exhau&s;ted their provi&s;ions,
<PB N="216" REF="026637_0214_0FD104A2D5731AA8">
that they were glad to eat their dogs before they returned to Roanoke.</P>
<P>During this excur&s;ion, their friend Gran|ganimeo died; and his brother Wingina di&s;|covered his ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition toward the col|ony. The return of Mr. Lane and his party, from their excur&s;ion, gave a check to his mal|ice for a while; but he &s;ecretly laid a plot for their de&s;truction; which being betrayed to the Engli&s;h, they &s;eized all the boats on the i&s;land. This brought on a &s;kirmi&s;h, in which five or &s;ix Indians were killed, and the re&s;t fled to the woods. After much jealou&s;y and di&s;&s;imulation on both &s;ides, Wingina was drawn into a &s;nare; and with eight of his men, fell a &s;acrifice to the re&s;entment of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>In a few days after Wingina's death, Sir Francis Drake, who had been crui&s;ing again&s;t the Spaniards in the We&s;t Indies, and had received orders from the Queen to vi&s;it this colony, arrived with his fleet on the coa&s;t; and by the unanimous de&s;ire of the people, took them all off and carried them to England, where they arrived in July 1586.</P>
<P>Within a fortnight after the departure of this unfortunate colony, Sir Richard Grenville
<PB N="217" REF="026637_0215_0FD104A8E1D60878">
arrived with three &s;hips for their relief. Find|ing their habitation abandoned, and being un|able to gain any intelligence of them; he landed fifty men, on the i&s;land of Roanoke, plentifully &s;upplied with provi&s;ions for two years, and then returned to England.</P>
<P>The next year (1587) three &s;hips were &s;ent, under the command of John White, who was appointed Governor of the colony, with twelve Coun&s;ellors. To them Raleigh gave a charter of incorporation for the city of Ra|leigh, which he ordered them to build on the river Che&s;epeag, the northern extent of the di&s;covery. After narrowly e&s;caping &s;hipwreck on Cape Fear, they arrived at Hatteras, on the 22d of July, and &s;ent a party to Roanoke to look for the &s;econd colony of fifty men. They found no per&s;on living, and the bones of but one dead. The huts were &s;tanding; but were overgrown with bu&s;hes and weeds. In conver&s;ation with &s;ome of the natives, they were informed, that the colony had been de|&s;troyed by Wingina's people, in revenge of his death.</P>
<P>Mr. White endeavoured to renew a friendly intercour&s;e with tho&s;e natives; but their jea|lou&s;y rendered them implacable. He there|fore
<PB N="218" REF="026637_0216_0FD104AB694189E8">
went acro&s;s the water to the main with a party of twenty five men, and came &s;udden|ly on a company of friendly Indians, who were &s;eated round a fire, one of whom they killed before they di&s;covered the mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Two remarkable events are mentioned as happening at this time; one was the bapti&s;m of Manteo, the faithful Indian guide; the other was the birth of a female child, daugh|ter of Ananias Dare, one of the Council; which, being the fir&s;t child born in the colo|ny, was named Virginia.</P>
<P>By this time (Augu&s;t 21) the &s;hips had un|loaded their &s;tores and were preparing to re|turn to England. It was evident that a farth|er &s;upply was nece&s;&s;ary, and that &s;ome per&s;on mu&s;t go home to &s;olicit it. A di&s;pute aro&s;e in the Council on this point, and after much altercation, it was determined, that the Gov|ernor was the mo&s;t proper per&s;on, to be &s;ent on this errand. The whole colony joined in reque&s;ting him to proceed, promi&s;ing to take care of his intere&s;t in his ab&s;ence. With much reluctance he con&s;ented, on their &s;ub|&s;cribing a te&s;timonial of his unwillingne&s;s to quit the plantation. He accordingly &s;ailed on the 27th of Augu&s;t, and arrived in England
<PB N="219" REF="026637_0217_0FD104AE0E3DA910">
the following November. The nation was in a &s;tate of alarm and apprehen&s;ion on ac|count of the war with Spain, and of the in|vincible armada, which had threatened it with an inva&s;ion. Sir Walter Raleigh was one of the Queen's Council of war, as were al&s;o Sir Richard Grenville and Mr. Lane. Their time was wholly taken up with public con&s;ultations, and Governor White was o|bliged to wait, till the plan of operations a|gain&s;t the enemy could be adju&s;ted and carri|ed into execution.</P>
<P>The next &s;pring, Raleigh and Grenville, who had the command of the militia in Cornwall, and were training them for the defence of the kingdom; being &s;trongly &s;olicited by White, provided two &s;mall barks, which &s;ailed from Biddeford on the 22d of April 1588. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els had commi&s;&s;ions as &s;hips of war, and being more intent on gain to them&s;elves, than relief to the colony, went in chace of prizes, and were both driven back by &s;hips of &s;uperi|or force, to the great mortification of their patron, and the ruin of his colony.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;appointments were a &s;ource of vexation to Raleigh. He had expended forty thou&s;and pounds, of his own and other men's
<PB N="220" REF="026637_0218_0FD104B241EAAD48">
money, in pur&s;uit of his favourite object; and his gains were yet to come. He therefore made an a&s;&s;ignment of his patent (March 7, 1589) to Thomas Smith, and other merch|ants and adventurers, among whom was Gov|ernor White; with a donation of one hun|dred pounds, for the propagation of the Chri&s;|tian religon in Virginia. Being thus di&s;en|gaged from the bu&s;ine&s;s of colonization; he had full &s;cope for his martial genius, in the war with Spain.</P>
<P>His a&s;&s;ignees were not &s;o zealous in the pro|&s;ecution of their bu&s;ine&s;s. It was not till the &s;pring of 1590, that Governor White could return to his colony. Then, with three &s;hips, he &s;ailed from Plymouth, and pa&s;&s;ing through the We&s;t Indies, in que&s;t of Spani&s;h prizes, he arrived at Hatteras on the 15th of Augu&s;t. From this place they ob&s;erved a &s;moke ari&s;ing on the i&s;land of Roanoke; which gave them &s;ome hope that the colony was there &s;ub&s;i&s;ting; on their coming to the place, they found old trees and gra&s;s burning, of but no human being. On a po&s;t of one of the hou&s;es they &s;aw the word <HI>Croatan,</HI> which gave them &s;ome hope, that at the i&s;land of that name they &s;hould find their

<HEAD>X. JOHN DE FUCA.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the exi&s;tence of a we&s;tern continent was known to the maritime nations of Europe, one great object of their in|quiry was, to find, through &s;ome openings which appeared in it, a pa&s;&s;age to India and China. For this purpo&s;e &s;everal expen&s;ive and un&s;ucce&s;sful voyages were made; and ev|ery hint which could throw any light on the &s;ubject was eagerly &s;ought and attended to, by tho&s;e who con&s;idered its importance.</P>
<P>JOHN DE FUCA was a Greek, born in the i&s;land of Cephalonia in the Adriatic gulf. He had been employed in the &s;ervice of Spain, in the We&s;t Indies, as a mariner and pilot, above forty years. Having lo&s;t his fortune, amount|ing (as he &s;aid) to &s;ixty thou&s;and ducats, when the Acapulco &s;hip was taken, by Captain Cavendi&s;h an Engli&s;hman; and being di&s;ap|pointed of the recompen&s;e which he had ex|pected from the court of Spain; he returned in di&s;gu&s;t, to his native country, by the way of Italy; that he might &s;pend the evening of his life, in peace and poverty, among his friends.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="026637_0223_0FD104BB9EEF24C8">At Florence he met with John Douglas, an Engli&s;hman, and went with him to Venice. There, Douglas introduced him to Michael Lock, who had been Con&s;ul of the Turkey company at Aleppo, and was then occa&s;ional|ly re&s;ident in Venice. (A. D. 1596.)</P>
<P>In conver&s;ation with Mr. Lock, De Fuca gave him the following account of his adven|tures.</P>
<P>"That he had been &s;ent by the Viceroy of Mexico, as pilot of three &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, to di&s;|cover the &s;traits of Anian, on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of America; through which, it was conjectured that a pa&s;&s;age might be found, in|to &s;ome of the deep bays on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the continent. This voyage was fru&s;trated, by the mi&s;conduct of the commander, and the mutiny of the &s;eamen.</P>
<P>"In 1592 the Viceroy &s;ent him again, with the command of a caravel and a pinnace, on the &s;ame enterprize. Between the latitudes of 47&deg; and 48&deg; N. he di&s;covered an inlet, into which he entered and &s;ailed more than twenty days. At the entrance was a great headland, with an exceeding high pinnacle or &s;pired rock, like a pillar. Within the &s;trait, the land &s;tretched N.W. and N.E. and al&s;o E. and S.E. It was
<PB N="226" REF="026637_0224_0FD104BDF01CF4A0">
much wider within, than at the entrance, and contained many i&s;lands. The inhabitants were clad in the &s;kins of bea&s;ts. The land appear|ed to be fertile like that of New Spain, and was rich in gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;ing that he had accompli&s;hed the intention of the voyage and penetrated into the North Sea; but not being &s;trong enough, to re&s;i&s;t the force of the numerous &s;avages, who appeared on the &s;hores; he returned to Acapulco, before the expiration of the year."</P>
<P>Such was the account given by De Fuca; and Mr. Lock was &s;o impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;in|cerity of the relation and the advantages which his countrymen might derive from a know|ledge of this &s;trait; that he earne&s;tly urged him to enter into the &s;ervice of Queen Eliza|beth, and perfect the di&s;covery. He &s;ucceed|ed &s;o far, as to obtain a promi&s;e from the Greek, though &s;ixty years old; that if the Queen would furni&s;h him with one &s;hip, of forty tons, and a pinnace, he would undertake the voyage. He was the more ea&s;ily per|&s;uaded to this, by a hope that the Queen would make him &s;ome recompence for the lo&s;s of his fortune by Capt. Cavendi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="026637_0225_0FD104BF6FF54478">Mr. Lock wrote to the Lord Trea&s;urer Cecil, Sir Walter Raleigh and Mr. Hakluyt, reque&s;ting that they would forward the &s;cheme, and that one hundred pounds might be advanced to bring De Fuca to England. The &s;cheme was approved; but the money was not advanced. Lock was &s;o much en|gaged in it, that he would have &s;ent him to England at his own expen&s;e; but he was then endeavouring to recover at law, his de|mands from the Turkey company, and could not di&s;bur&s;e the money. The pilot there|fore returned to Cephalonia; and Lock kept up a corre&s;pondence with him, till 1602, when he heard of his death.</P>

On the &s;tarboard &s;ide, is a point of land terminating in a remarkably tall rock, called the pillar. Within the entrance, the pa&s;&s;age grows wider, extending to the S. E. N. and N.

<HEAD>XI. BARTHOLOMEW GOSNOLD.</HEAD>
<P>THE unfortunate i&s;&s;ue of Raleigh's at|tempt to make a &s;ettlement in America, to|gether with the war with Spain, which con|tinued for &s;everal years, gave a check to the &s;pirit of colonizing. In the beginning of the &s;eventeenth century it was revived by BAR|THOLOMEW GOSNOLD, an intrepid mariner in the we&s;t of England. At who&s;e expen&s;e he undertook his voyage, to the northern part of Virginia, does not appear; but, on the 26th of March 1602, he &s;ailed from Fal|mouth, in Cornwall, in a &s;mall bark, with thirty two men. In&s;tead of going by the way of the Canaries and the We&s;t Indies, he kept as far north as the winds would permit, and was the fir&s;t Engli&s;hman who came in a direct cour&s;e to this part of America.</P>
<P>On the 14th of May they made the land, and met with a &s;hallop of European fabric, in which were eight &s;avages, one of whom was dre&s;&s;ed in European clothes; from which they concluded that &s;ome unfortunate fi&s;her|men of Bi&s;cay or Brittany, had been wrecked on the coa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="026637_0230_0FD104CC2542AE58">The next day they had again &s;ight of land, which appeared like an i&s;land, by rea&s;on of a large &s;ound which lay between it and the main. This &s;ound they called Shole Hope. Near this cape they took a great number of cod, from which circum&s;tance they named the land <HI>Cape Cod.</HI> It is de&s;cribed as a low &s;andy &s;hore in the latitude of 42&deg;. The Cap|tain went on &s;hore and found the &s;and very deep. A young Indian, with plates of copper hanging to his ears, and a bow and arrows in his hand, came to him, and in a friendly man|ner offered his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>On the 16th, they coa&s;ted the land &s;outh|erly, and at the end of twelve leagues di&s;cov|ered a point, with breakers at a di&s;tance; and, in attempting to double it, came &s;uddenly in|to &s;hoal water. To this point of land they gave the name of Point Care; it is now call|ed Sandy Point, and forms the &s;outhea&s;tern extremity of the county of Barn&s;table, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
<P>Finding them&s;elves &s;urrounded by &s;hoals and breakers, they lay at anchor till they had examined the coa&s;t and &s;oundings in their boat; during which time &s;ome of the natives made them a vi&s;it. One of them had a plate
<PB N="233" REF="026637_0231_0FD104CE6A2F6870">
of copper over his brea&s;t, a foot in length and half a foot in breadth; the others had pend|ants of the &s;ame metal as their ears: they all had pipes and tobacco, of which they were very fond.</P>
<P>In &s;urveying the coa&s;t they di&s;covered breakers lying off a point of land, which they denominated Gilbert's Point; it is now call|ed Point Gammon, and forms the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the harbour of Hyennes.</P>
<P>On the 19th they pa&s;&s;ed the breach of Gil|bert's Point, in four and five fathoms of water, and anchored a league or more to the we&s;t|ward of it. Several hummocks and hills appeared, which at fir&s;t were taken to be i&s;lands; the&s;e were the high lands of Barn&s;ta|ble and Yarmouth.</P>
<P>To the we&s;tward of Gilbert's Point, ap|peared an opening, which Go&s;nold imagined to have a communication with the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ound which he had &s;een we&s;tward of Cape Cod; he therefore gave it the &s;ame name Shole Hope; but finding the water to be no more than three fathoms deep, at the di&s;tance of a league, he did not attempt to enter it. From this opening, the land tended to the &s;outhwe&s;t; and, in coa&s;ting it, they came to
<PB N="234" REF="026637_0232_0FD104CF47829F68">
an i&s;land to which they gave the name of <HI>Martha's Vineyard.</HI> This i&s;land is de&s;cribed as "di&s;tant eight leagues from Shole Hope, five miles in circuit, and uninhabited; full of wood, <HI>vines</HI> and berries: here they &s;aw deer and took abundance of cod."</P>
<P>From their &s;tation off this i&s;land, where they rode in eight fathoms, they &s;ailed on the 24th; and doubled the cape of another i&s;land, next to it, which they called Dover cliff: this cour&s;e brought them into a &s;ound, where they anchored for the night, and the next morning &s;ent their boat to examine another cape, which lay between them and the main, from which projected a ledge of rocks, a mile into the &s;ea, but all above water, and not dan|gerous. Having pa&s;&s;ed round them, they came to anchor again, in one of the fine&s;t &s;ounds, which they had ever &s;een; and to which they gave the name of Go&s;nold's Hope. On the northern &s;ide of it was the main; and on the &s;outhern, parallel to it, at the di&s;tance of four leagues, was a large i&s;land which they called Elizabeth, in honor of their Queen. On this i&s;land they determined to take up their abode; and pitched upon a &s;mall woody i&s;let in the middle of a fre&s;h pond, as a &s;afe
<PB N="235" REF="026637_0233_0FD104D1391C25D0">
place to build their fort. A little to the northward of this large i&s;land lay a &s;mall one half a mile in compa&s;s, and full of cedars. This they called Hill's Hap. On the op|po&s;ite northern &s;hore appeared another &s;imi|lar elevation to which they gave the name of Hap's Hill.</P>
<P>By this de&s;cription of the coa&s;t it is evident that the &s;ound into which Go&s;nold entered was Buzzard's Bay. The i&s;land which he called Martha's Vineyard, was not that which now goes by that name, but a &s;mall i&s;land, the ea&s;ternmo&s;t of tho&s;e which are known by the name of Elizabeth's i&s;lands. It is called by the Indians Nenimi&s;&s;ett; its pre&s;ent cir|cumference is about four miles, but it has doubtle&s;s been dimini&s;hed &s;ince Go&s;nold's time, by the force of the tides which &s;et into and out of the bay with great rapidity. Its natural productions and plea&s;ant &s;ituation an|&s;wer well to his de&s;cription; and deer are frequently &s;een and hunted upon it: but none were ever known to have been on the great i&s;land, now called Martha's Vineyard; which is above twenty miles in length and was always full of inhabitants. For what rea&s;on and at what time the name was tran&s;|ferred
<PB N="236" REF="026637_0234_0FD104D25AAFCD68">
from the one to the other, I have not yet learned.</P>
<P>The cliff named Dover is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ea&s;tern head of a &s;mall i&s;land which was called by the natives Onky Tonky, and is now corrupted into Uncle Timmy. The rocky ledge is called Rattle&s;nake Neck. Hill's Hap con&s;i&s;ts now of two very &s;mall i&s;lands called Wicpeckets. There is every appear|ance that the&s;e were formerly united; and there are now a few cedars on them. Hap's Hill, on the oppo&s;ite part of the main, is a &s;mall elevated i&s;land, of an oval form, near the mouth of a river which pa&s;&s;es through the towns of Wareham and Roche&s;ter. It is a con&s;picuous object to navigators.</P>
<P>The i&s;land on which Go&s;nold and his com|pany took up their abode, is now called by its Indian name Nau&s;haun, and is the property of the Honourable JAMES BOWDOIN, of Bo&s;|ton, to whom I am indebted for the&s;e remarks on Go&s;nold's journal, which is extant at large in Purchas's collections.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. v, p. 1647.</NOTE></P>
<P>Near the &s;outhwe&s;t end of Nau&s;haun is a large fre&s;h pond; &s;uch an one as an&s;wers to Go&s;nold's de&s;cription, excepting that there is

no i&s;let in the middle of it. The &s;hore is &s;andy; but what revolution may have taken place within the &s;pace of almo&s;t two centuries pa&s;t, we cannot &s;ay.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;ome of Go&s;nold's men laboured in building a fort and &s;tore hou&s;e on the &s;mall i&s;land in the pond, and a flat boat to go to it; he cro&s;&s;ed the bay in his ve&s;&s;el and di&s;covered the mouths of two rivers: one was that near which lay Hap's Hill, and the other, that, on the &s;hore of which the town of New-Bedford is now built.</P>
<P>After five days ab&s;ence, Go&s;nold returned to the i&s;land and was received by his people with great ceremony; on account of an Indian chief and fifty of his men who were there on a vi&s;it. To this chief they pre&s;ented a &s;traw hat and two knives; the hat he little regarded; but the knives were highly valued. They fea&s;ted the&s;e &s;avages with fi&s;h and mu&s;tard, and diverted them&s;elves with the effect of the mu&s;tard on their no&s;es. One of them &s;tole a target, but it was re&s;tored. They did not ap|pear to be inhabitants, but occa&s;ional vi&s;itants at the i&s;land, for the &s;ake of gathering &s;hell|fi&s;h. Four of them remained, after the others
<PB N="238" REF="026637_0236_0FD104D934630E78">
were gone, and helped the Engli&s;h to dig the roots of &s;a&s;&s;afras; with which, as well as the furs which they bought of the Indians, the ve&s;&s;el was loaded.</P>
<P>After &s;pending three weeks in preparing a &s;tore hou&s;e, when they came to divide their provi&s;ion, there was not enough to victual the &s;hip, and to &s;ub&s;i&s;t the planters till the &s;hip's return. Some jealou&s;y al&s;o aro&s;e about the intentions of tho&s;e who were going back; and after five days con&s;ultation they determin|ed to give up their de&s;ign of planting, and re|turn to England. On the eighteenth of June they &s;ailed out of the bay through the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age by which they had entered it; and on the twenty third of July they arrived at Ex|mouth, in the we&s;t of England.</P>
<P>Go&s;nold's intention was to have remained with a part of his men, and to have &s;ent Gil|bert, the &s;econd in command, to England, for farther &s;upplies; but half of &s;o &s;mall a com|pany would not have been a &s;ufficient num|ber to re&s;i&s;t the &s;avages, had they been di&s;po&s;ed to attack them.</P>
<P>After his return to England he was inde|fatigable in his endeavours to forward the &s;et|&s;ettling

<HEAD>XII. JOHN SMITH.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the early part of the life of this extraordinary man was &s;pent in foreign travels and adventures which have no refer|ence to America; yet the incidents of that period &s;o &s;trongly mark his character, and give &s;uch a tincture to his &s;ub&s;equent actions, and are withal &s;o &s;ingular in them&s;elves, that no reader (it is pre&s;umed) will cen&s;ure the in|troduction of them here as impertinent.</P>
<P>He was born at Willoughby, in Lincoln|&s;hire, in the year 1579.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This is determined by an in&s;cription annexed to his portrait on his map of New-England&mdash;"Aetat 37. Anno 1616."</P>
<P>This portrait repre&s;ents him clad <HI>in armour</HI> and under it are the&s;e ver&s;es:
<Q><L>"Such are the lines that &s;hew thy face; but tho&s;e</L>

When about thirteen years of age, he &s;old his books and &s;atchel, and his puerile trinkets, to
<PB N="241" REF="026637_0239_0FD104DF88A6A150">
rai&s;e money, with a view to convey him&s;elf privately to &s;ea; but the death of his father put a &s;top for the pre&s;ent to this attempt, and threw him into the hands of guardians, who en|deavoured to check the ardour of his genius, by confining him to a compting hou&s;e. Being put apprentice to a merchant at Lynn, at the age of fifteen, he at fir&s;t conceived hopes that his ma&s;ter would &s;end him to &s;ea in his &s;ervice, but this hope failing, he quitted his ma&s;ter, and with only ten &s;hillings in his pocket, en|tered into the train of a young nobleman who was travelling to France. At Orleans he was di&s;charged from his attendance on lord Bertie, and had money given him to return to Eng|land. With this money he vi&s;ited Paris, and proceeded to the Low Countries, where he en|li&s;ted as a &s;oldier, and learned the rudiments of war, a &s;cience peculiarly agreeable to his ardent and active genius. Meeting with a Scots gentleman abroad, he was per&s;uad-to pa&s;s into Scotland, with the promi&s;e of be|ing &s;trongly recommended to King James; but being baffled in this expectation, he re|turned to his native town, and finding no company there which &s;uited his ta&s;te, he built a booth in a wood, and betook him&s;elf
<PB N="242" REF="026637_0240_0FD104E1AAF8D2F0">
to the &s;tudy of military hi&s;tory and tactics, di|verting him&s;elf at intervals with his hor&s;e and lance; in which exerci&s;e he at length found a companion, an Italian gentleman, rider to the earl of Lincoln, who drew him from his &s;yl|van retirement to Tatter&s;al.</P>
<P>Having recovered a part of the e&s;tate which his father had left him, he put him&s;elf into a better condition than before, and &s;et off again on his travels, in the winter of the year 1596, being then only &s;eventeen years of age. His fir&s;t &s;tage was Flanders, where meeting with a Frenchman who pretended to be heir to a noble family, he, with his three attendants, prevailed upon Smith to go with them to France. In a dark night they arrived at St. Valery in Picardy, and, by the conni|vance of the &s;hip ma&s;ter, the Frenchmen were carried a&s;hore with the trunks of our young traveller, whil&s;t he was left on board till the return of the boat. In the mean time they had conveyed the baggage out of his reach, and were not to be found. A &s;ailor on board, who knew the villains, generou&s;ly undertook to conduct him to Mortaine where they lived, and &s;upplied his wants till their arrival at the place. Here he found their friends, from whom he could gain no recompence; but the
<PB N="243" REF="026637_0241_0FD104E3F4212F30">
report of his &s;ufferings induced &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction to invite him to their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Eager to pur&s;ue his travels, and not caring to receive favours which he was unable to re|quite, he left his new friends and went from port to port in &s;earch of a &s;hip of war. In one of the&s;e rambles, near Dinan, it was his chance to meet one of the villains who had robbed him. Without &s;peaking a word, they both drew; and Smith having wound|ed and di&s;armed his antagoni&s;t, obliged him to confe&s;s his guilt before a number of per|&s;ons who had a&s;&s;embled on the occa&s;ion. Sat|isfied with his victory, he retired to the &s;eat of an acquaintance, the earl of Ployer, who had been brought up in England, and having received &s;upplies from him, he travelled along the French coa&s;t to Bayonne, and from thence cro&s;&s;ed over to Mar&s;eilles; vi&s;iting and ob&s;erv|ing every thing in his way which had any reference to naval or military architecture.</P>
<P>At Mar&s;eilles he embarked for Italy, in company with a rabble of pilgrims. The &s;hip was forced by a tempe&s;t into the harbour of Toulon, and afterward was obliged by a contrary wind to anchor under the little i&s;land of St. Mary, off Nice, in Savoy. The bigotry of the pilgrims made them a&s;cribe

their ill fortune to the pre&s;ence of a heretic on board. They devoutly cur&s;ed Smith, and his Queen Elizabeth, and in a fit of pious rage threw him into the &s;ea. He &s;wam to the i&s;land, and the next day was taken on board a &s;hip of St. Malo which had al&s;o put in there for &s;helter. The ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, who was well known to his noble friend the earl of Ployer, entertained him kindly, and carried him to Alexandria in Egypt; from thence he coa&s;ted the Levant; and on his return had the high &s;atisfaction of a naval engagement with a Venetian &s;hip, which they took and rifled of her rich cargo. Smith was &s;et on &s;hore at Antibes with a box of a thou&s;and chequins, (about 2000 dollars) by the help of which he made the tour of Italy, cro&s;&s;ed the Adriatic and travelled into Stiria, to the &s;eat of Ferdinand, Archduke of Au&s;tria. Here he met with an Engli&s;h and an Iri&s;h Je&s;uit who introduced him to lord Eber&s;paught, baron Kizel and other officers of di&s;tinction, and here he found full &s;cope for his genius; for the emperor being then at war with the Turks, he entered into his army as a vol|unteer.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="026637_0243_0FD104E76A0CCD10">He had communicated to Eber&s;paught a method of conver&s;ing at a di&s;tance by &s;ignals made with torches, which being alternately &s;hown and hidden a certain number of times, de&s;ignated every letter of the alphabet. He had &s;oon after an opportunity of making the experiment. Eber&s;paught being be&s;ieged by the Turks in the &s;trong town of Olimpach, was cut off from all intelligence and hope of &s;uccour from his friends. Smith propo&s;ed his method of communication to baron Kizel, who approved it, and allowed him to put it in practice.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The method is this. Fir&s;t, three torches are &s;hown in a line equi-di&s;tant from each other, which are an&s;wered by three others in the &s;ame manner.

At the di&s;|play of the &s;ignal, Eber&s;paught knew and an|&s;wered it, and Smith conveyed to him this intelligence, "Thur&s;day night, I will charge

on the Ea&s;t; at the alarm &s;ally thou." The an&s;wer was "I will." Ju&s;t before the at|tack, by Smith's advice, a great number of fal&s;e fires were made on another quarter, which divided the attention of the enemy and gave advantage to the a&s;&s;ailants; who, be|ing a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a &s;ally from the town, killed many of the Turks, drove others into the river, and threw &s;uccours into the place, which obliged the enemy the next day to rai&s;e the &s;iege. This well conducted exploit, pro|duced to our young adventurer, the command of a company, con&s;i&s;ting of two hundred and fifty hor&s;emen in the regiment of count Mel|drick, a nobleman of Tran&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>The regiment in which he &s;erved being en|gaged in &s;everal hazardous enterprizes, Smith was foremo&s;t in all dangers and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf both by his ingenuity and by his val|our; and when Meldrick left the Imperial army, and pa&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice of his native prince, Smith followed him.</P>
<P>At the &s;iege of Regal, the Ottomans derided the &s;low approaches of the Tran&s;ylvanian army, and &s;ent a challenge, purporting that the lord Turbi&s;ha, to divert the ladies, would fight any &s;ingle Captain of the Chri&s;tian troops.
<PB N="247" REF="026637_0245_0FD104EF05F859D0">
The honour of accepting this challenge, being determined by lot, fell on Captain Smith; who, meeting his antagoni&s;t on hor&s;eback, within view of the ladies on the battlements, at the &s;ound of mu&s;ic began the encounter, and in a &s;hort time killed him, and bore away his head in triumph to his general the lord Moyzes.</P>
<P>The death of the chief &s;o irritated his friend Grualgo, that he &s;ent a particular challenge to the conqueror, who, meeting him with the &s;ame ceremonies, after a &s;mart combat, took off his head al&s;o. Smith then in his turn &s;ent a me&s;&s;age into the town, informing the ladies, that if they wi&s;hed for more diver|&s;ion, they &s;hould be welcome to his head, in ca&s;e their third Champion could take it. This challenge was accepted by Bonamolgro, who unhor&s;ed Smith and was near gaining the victory. But remounting in a critical moment, he gave the Turk a &s;troke with his faulchion which brought him to the ground, and his head was added to the number. For the&s;e &s;ingular exploits he was honoured with a military proce&s;&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix thou&s;and men, three led hor&s;es, and the Turks' heads on the points of three lances. With this ce|remony

Smith was conducted to the pavilion of his general, who, after embracing him, pre&s;ented him with a hor&s;e richly furni&s;hed, a &s;cymitar and belt worth three hundred ducats, and a commi&s;&s;ion to be major in his regiment. The prince of Tran&s;ylvania, after the capture of the place, made him a pre&s;ent of his picture &s;et in gold, and a pen&s;ion of three hundred ducats per annum, and moreover granted him a coat of arms bearing three Turks' heads in a &s;hield. The patent was admitted and recorded in the college of Heralds in England, by Sir Henry Segar, garter king at arms. Smith was always proud of this di&s;tingui&s;hing honour, and the&s;e arms are accordingly blazoned in the fronti&s;piece to his hi&s;tory, with this motto,
<Q>"Vincere e&s;t vivere."</Q></P>
<P>After this, the Tran&s;ylvanian army was de|feated by a body of Turks and Tartars near Rotenton, and many brave men were &s;lain, among whom were nine Engli&s;h and Scots officers, who, after the fa&s;hion of that day, had entered into this &s;ervice, from a religious zeal to drive the Turks out of Chri&s;tendom. Smith was wounded in this battle and lay among the dead. His habit di&s;covered him
<PB N="249" REF="026637_0247_0FD104F389772C08">
to the victors as a per&s;on of con&s;equence; they u&s;ed him well till his wounds were heal|ed, and then &s;old him to the Ba&s;ha Bogal, who &s;ent him as a pre&s;ent to his mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Tra|gabigzanda</HI> at Con&s;tantinople, accompanied with a me&s;&s;age, as full of vanity as void of truth, that he had conquered in battle a Bo|hemian nobleman, and pre&s;ented him to her as a &s;lave.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent proved more acceptable to the lady than her lord intended. She could &s;peak Italian; and Smith, in that language, not only informed her of his country and quality, but conver&s;ed with her in &s;o plea&s;ing a manner as to gain her affections. The connexion prov|ed &s;o tender, that to &s;ecure him for her&s;elf and to prevent his being ill u&s;ed or &s;old again, &s;he &s;ent him to her brother the Ba&s;ha of Nalbraitz, in the country of the Cambrian Tartars, on the borders of the &s;ea of A&s;oph. Her pre|tence was, that he &s;hould there learn the man|ners and language as well as religion of the Tartars. By the terms in which &s;he wrote to her brother, he &s;u&s;pected her de&s;ign, and re&s;olved to di&s;appoint her. Within an hour after Smith's arrival he was &s;tripped; his head and beard were &s;haven, an iron collar was
<PB N="250" REF="026637_0248_0FD104F5DEA108B0">
put about his neck; he was clothed with a coat of hair-cloth, and driven to labour among other Chri&s;tian &s;laves. He had now no hope of redemption, but from the love of his mi&s;|tre&s;s, who was at a great di&s;tance, and not like|ly to be informed of his misfortune; the hopele&s;s condition of his fellow &s;laves could not alleviate his de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>In the depth of his di&s;tre&s;s, an opportunity pre&s;ented for an e&s;cape, which to a per&s;on of a le&s;s courageous and adventrous &s;pirit would have proved an aggravation of mi&s;ery. He was employed in thre&s;hing, at a grange, in a large field about a league from the hou&s;e of his tyrant, who in his daily vi&s;its treated him with abu&s;ive language, accompanied with blows and kicks. This was more than Smith could bear, wherefore watching an opportu|nity when no other per&s;on was pre&s;ent, he lev|elled a &s;troke at him with his thre&s;hing in|&s;trument, which di&s;patched him. Then hid|ing his body in the &s;traw and &s;hutting the doors, he filled a bag with grain, mounted the Ba&s;ha's hor&s;e, and betaking him&s;elf to the de&s;art, wandered for two or three days, ig|norant of the way, and &s;o fortunate as not to meet with a &s;ingle per&s;on who might give
<PB N="251" REF="026637_0249_0FD104F84D076B30">
information of his flight. At length he came to a po&s;t erected in a cro&s;s road, by the marks on which he found the way to Mo&s;covy, and in &s;ixteen days arrived at Exapolis on the river Don; where was a Ru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on, the com|mander of which under&s;tanding that he was a Chri&s;tian, received him courteou&s;ly; took off his iron collar, and gave him letters to the other governors in that region. Thus he travelled through part of Ru&s;&s;ia and Poland, till he got back to his friends in Tran&s;ylvania; receiving pre&s;ents in his way from many per|&s;ons of di&s;tinction, among whom he particu|larly mentions a charitable lady, Callamata, being always proud of his connexion with that &s;ex, and fond of acknowledging their fav|ours. At Leip&s;ic he met with his colonel, count Meldrick, and Sigi&s;mund, prince of Tran&s;ylvania, who gave him 1500 ducats to repair his lo&s;&s;es. With this money he was enabled to travel through Germany, France, and Spain, and having vi&s;ited the kingdom of Morocco, he returned by &s;ea to England; having in his pa&s;&s;age enjoyed the plea&s;ure of another naval engagement. At his arrival in his native country he had a thou&s;and ducats in his pur&s;e, which, with the intere&s;t he had
<PB N="252" REF="026637_0250_0FD104FA6CFA9A48">
remaining in England, he devoted to &s;eek adventures and make di&s;coveries in NORTH AMERICA.</P>
<P>Bartholomew Go&s;nold having conceived a favourable idea of America, had made it his bu&s;ine&s;s, on his return to England, to &s;olicit a&s;&s;i&s;tance in pro&s;ecuting di&s;coveries. Meet|ing with Captain Smith, he readily entered into his views, the employment being exactly &s;uited to his enterprizing genius. Having en|gaged Edward Maria Wingfield, a merchant, Robert Hunt, a clergyman, and &s;everal others, they prevailed upon a number of noblemen, gentlemen, and merchants, to &s;olicit a patent from the crown, by which the adventurers to Virginia became &s;ubject to legal direction, and had the &s;upport and encouragement of a wealthy and re&s;pectable corporation; which was u&s;ually &s;tyled the South Virginia compa|ny, or the London company, in di&s;tinction from the Plymouth company, who &s;uperin|tended the affairs of North Virginia. The date of their patent was April 10, 1606, and on the 19th of the following December, three &s;hips, one of one hundred tons, another of forty, and one of twenty, fell down the river Thames for Virginia. The commander was
<PB N="253" REF="026637_0251_0FD104FB50E7F508">
Chri&s;topher Newport, an experienced mari|ner. They had on board the nece&s;&s;ary per|&s;ons and provi&s;ions for a colony; and their orders for government were &s;ealed in a box, which was not to be opened till they &s;hould arrive in Virginia.</P>
<P>The &s;hips were kept in the Downs by bad weather &s;ix weeks, and afterward had a tem|pe&s;tuous voyage. They took the old route by the Canary and Caribbee i&s;lands, and did not make the entrance of Che&s;apeak Bay till the 26th of April 1607. From the begin|ning of their embarkation, there was a jealou|&s;y and di&s;&s;ention among the company. Smith and Hunt were friends, and both were envied and &s;u&s;pected by the others. Hunt was ju|dicious and patient, his office &s;ecured him from in&s;ult. Smith was ardent and indu&s;tri|ous, courteous in his deportment, but liberal in his language. On &s;ome &s;ugge&s;tions that he intended to u&s;urp the government, and that his confederates were di&s;per&s;ed among the companies of each &s;hip, he was made a pri&s;oner from the time of their leaving the Canaries, and was under confinement when they arrived in the Che&s;apeak. When the box was opened it was found that Bartholo|mew

Go&s;nold, John Smith, Edward M. Wingfield, Chri&s;topher Newport, John Rat|cliff, John Martin, and George Kendal were named to be of the council; who were to chu&s;e a pre&s;ident from among them&s;elves for one year, and the government was ve&s;ted in them. Matters of moment were to be "examined by a jury, but determined by the major part of the council, in which the pre&s;ident had two voices." When the council was &s;worn, Wingfield was cho&s;en pre&s;ident, and a decla|ration was made of the rea&s;ons for which Smith was not admitted and &s;worn among the others.</P>
<P>Seventeen days from their arrival were &s;pent in &s;eeking a proper place for their fir&s;t planta|tion. The &s;outhern point of the bay was named Cape Henry, and the northern Cape Charles, in honour of the two &s;ons of King James. To the fir&s;t great river which they di&s;covered they gave the name of their &s;ove|reign; and the northern point of its entrance was called Point Comfort, on account of the good channel and anchorage which they found there. On the flats they took plenty of oy&s;ters, in &s;ome of which were pearls; and on the plain they found large and ripe &s;traw|berries,
<PB N="255" REF="026637_0253_0FD104FF64418650">
which afforded them a delicious re|pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Having met with five of the natives, they invited them to their town, Kecoughtan, where Hampton is now built. Here they were fea&s;ted with cakes made of Indian corn, and regaled with tobacco and a dance. In return they pre&s;ented the natives beads and other trinkets. Proceeding up the river, another company of Indians appeared in arms. Their chief, Apamatica, holding in one hand his bow and arrow, and in the other a pipe of tobacco, demanded the cau&s;e of their com|ing; they made &s;igns of peace, and were ho&s;|pitably received. On the 13th of May, they pitched upon a penin&s;ula where the &s;hips could lie in &s;ix fathom water, moored to the trees, as the place of their intended &s;ettlement. Here they were vi&s;ited by Pa&s;piha, another Indian chief, who being made acquainted with their de&s;ign, offered them as much land as they wanted, and afterward &s;ent them a deer for their entertainment. On this &s;pot they piched their tents, and gave it the name of James-town.</P>
<P>Every man was now employed either in digging and planting gardens, or making nets,
<PB N="256" REF="026637_0254_0FD1050092B3FAA8">
or in cutting and riving timber to relade the &s;hips. The pre&s;ident at fir&s;t would admit of no martial exerci&s;e, nor allow any fortifica|tions to be made excepting the boughs of trees thrown together in the form of a half moon. Captain Newport took Smith and twenty more with him to di&s;cover the head of James-river. In &s;ix days they arrived at the falls, and erect|ing a cro&s;s, as they had at Cape Henry, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country in the name of King James. In this route they vi&s;ited POWHA|TAN, the principal Indian chief, or emperor. His town con&s;i&s;ted of twelve hou&s;es plea&s;antly &s;ituate on a hill; before which were three i&s;lands, a little below the &s;pot where Rich|mond is now built. Captain Newport pre|&s;ented a hatchet to this prince, which he gratefully received, and when &s;ome of his In|dians murmured at the coming of the Eng|li&s;h among them, he &s;ilenced them by &s;aying "why &s;hould we be offended? they hurt us not, nor take any thing by force; they want only a little ground which we can ea&s;ily &s;pare." This appearance of friend&s;hip was not much relied on, when at their return to James-town, they found that the company had been &s;urpri&s;|ed at their work by a party of Indians, who
<PB N="257" REF="026637_0255_0FD105031A436F38">
had killed one and wounded &s;eventeen others. A double headed &s;hot from one of the &s;hips had cut off a bough of a tree, which falling among the Indians, terrified and di&s;per&s;ed them. This incident obliged the Pre&s;ident to alter the plan of the fort, which was now a triangular pali&s;ade with a lunette at each an|gle; and five pieces of artillery were mounted on the works, which were completed by the 15th of June. It was al&s;o found nece&s;&s;ary to exerci&s;e the men at arms, to mount guard and be vigilant, for the Indians would &s;urpri&s;e and mole&s;t &s;tragglers, whil&s;t by their &s;uperior a|gility they would e&s;cape unhurt.</P>
<P>The &s;hips being almo&s;t ready to return, it was thought proper that &s;ome deci&s;ion &s;hould be had re&s;pecting the allegations again&s;t Smith. His accu&s;ers affected commi&s;eration, and pre|tended to refer him to the cen&s;ure of the com|pany in England, rather than to expo&s;e him, to a legal pro&s;ecution which might injure his reputation or touch his life. Smith, who knew both their malice and their impotence, openly &s;corned their pretended pity and defied their re&s;entment. He had conducted him&s;elf &s;o unexceptionably in every employment which had been allotted to him, that he had
<PB N="258" REF="026637_0256_0FD1050465D67660">
rendered him&s;elf very popular; and his accu&s;|ers had by a different conduct lo&s;t the affec|tions and confidence of the people. Tho&s;e who had been &s;uborned to accu&s;e him ac|knowledged their fault, and di&s;covered the &s;e|cret arts which had been practi&s;ed again&s;t him. He demanded a trial, and the i&s;&s;ue was, that the Pre&s;ident was adjudged to pay him two hundred pounds; but when his pro|perty was &s;eized in part of this &s;atisfaction, Smith generou&s;ly turned it into the common &s;tore, for the benefit of the colony. Such an action could not but increa&s;e his popularity. Many other difficulties had ari&s;en among them, which, by the influence of Smith, and the exhortations of Hunt, their chaplain, were brought to a &s;eemingly amicable conclu|&s;ion. Smith was admitted to his &s;eat in the council, and on the next Sunday they celebrat|ed the communion. At the &s;ame time the Indians came in, and voluntarily de&s;ired peace. With the good report of the&s;e tran&s;actions Newport &s;ailed for England on the 22d of June, promi&s;ing to return in twenty weeks with fre&s;h &s;upplies.</P>
<P>The colony thus left in Virginia con&s;i&s;ted of one hundred and four per&s;ons, in very mi&s;|erable
<PB N="259" REF="026637_0257_0FD10506A9168248">
circum&s;tances, e&s;pecially on account of provi&s;ions, to which calamity their long voyage did not a little contribute, both as it con&s;umed their &s;tock, and deprived them of the opportunity of &s;owing &s;ea&s;onably in the &s;pring. Whil&s;t the &s;hips remained, they could barter with the &s;ailors for bread; but after their departure, each man's allowance was half a pint of damaged wheat, and as much barley, per day: the river, which at the flood was &s;alt, and at the ebb was muddy, afforded them their only drink; it al&s;o &s;uppli|ed them with &s;turgeon and &s;hellfi&s;h. This kind of food, with their continual labour in the heat of &s;ummer, and their frequent watch|ings by night in all weathers, having only the bare ground to lie on with but a &s;light cov|ering, produced di&s;ea&s;es among them; which by the month of September carried off fifty per&s;ons, among whom was Captain Go&s;nold. Tho&s;e who remained were divided into three watches, of whom not more than five in each were capable of duty at once. All this time the Pre&s;ident, Wingfield, who had the key of the &s;tores, monopolized the few refre&s;hments which remained, and was meditating to de|&s;ert the plantation privately in the pinnace,
<PB N="260" REF="026637_0258_0FD10508A4D415D8">
and remove to the We&s;t Indies. The&s;e things rendered him &s;o hateful to the re&s;t, that they depo&s;ed him and elected Ratcliffe in his room; they al&s;o removed Kendal from his place in the council, &s;o that by the middle of Septem|ber, three members only were left.</P>
<P>Ratcliffe, being a man of no re&s;olution nor activity, committed the management of affairs abroad to Smith, in whom his confidence was not mi&s;placed. At the &s;ame time the Indians in their neighbourhood brought in a plenti|ful &s;upply of &s;uch provi&s;ions as they had, which revived their drooping &s;pirits; and Smith &s;eeing the nece&s;&s;ity of exertion to &s;e|cure them&s;elves, and provide for the approach|ing winter, partly by his animating &s;peeches, but more by his example, &s;et them to work in mowing and binding thatch, and in build|ing and covering hou&s;es. In the&s;e exerci&s;es he bore a large &s;hare, and in a &s;hort time got a &s;ufficiency of hou&s;es to make comfortable lodgings for all the people excepting him&s;elf. This being done, and the provi&s;ions which the natives had brought in being expended, he picked a number of the be&s;t hands and em|barked in a &s;hallop which they had brought
<PB N="261" REF="026637_0259_0FD1050A478CC8F8">
from England, to &s;earch the country for a|nother &s;upply.</P>
<P>The party which accompanied Smith in this excur&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix men, well arm|ed, but ill provided with clothing and other nece&s;&s;aries. What was wanting in equipment was to be &s;upplied by re&s;olution and addre&s;s; and Smith's genius was equal to the attempt. They proceeded down the river to Kecoughtan [Hampton] where the natives, knowing the needy &s;tate of the colony, treated them with contempt, offering an ear of corn in exchange for a mu&s;ket, or a &s;word, and in like propor|tion for their &s;cant and tattered garments. Finding that courte&s;y and gentle treatment would not prevail, and that nothing was to be expected in the way of barter, and more|over provoked by their contempt, Smith order|ed his boat to be drawn on &s;hore and his men to fire at them. The affrighted natives fled to the woods, whil&s;t the party &s;earched their hou&s;es in which they found plenty of corn; but Smith did not permit his men to touch it; expecting that the Indians would return and attack them. They &s;oon appeared to the number of &s;ixty or &s;eventy, formed into a &s;quare carrying their idol OKEE, compo&s;ed
<PB N="262" REF="026637_0260_0FD1050D14F07D28">
of &s;kins, &s;tuffed with mo&s;s and adorned with chains of copper. They were armed with clubs and targets, bows and arrows, and ad|vanced, &s;inging, to the charge. The party re|ceived them with a volley of &s;hot, which brought &s;everal of them to the ground and their idol among them; the re&s;t fled again to the woods, from whence they &s;ent a depu|tation to offer peace and redeem their god. Smith, having in his hands &s;o valuable a pledge, was able to bring them to his own terms; he &s;tipulated that &s;ix of them &s;hould come unarmed, and load his boat with corn, and on this condition he would be their friend and give them hatchets, beads and copper. The&s;e &s;tipulations were faithfully performed on both &s;ides; and the Indians in addition pre&s;ented them with veni&s;on, turkies, and other birds; and continued &s;inging and danc|ing till their departure.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of this attempt encouraged him to repeat his excur&s;ions by land and wa|ter; in the cour&s;e of which he di&s;covered &s;everal branches of James-River, and particu|larly the Chickahamony, from who&s;e fertile banks he hoped to &s;upply the colony with provi&s;ion. But indu&s;try abroad will not make
<PB N="263" REF="026637_0261_0FD1050F4F3E5800">
a flouri&s;hing plantation without economy at home. What he had taken pains and ri&s;qued his life to provide, was carele&s;sly and wanton|ly expended; the traffic with the natives be|ing under no regulation, each per&s;on made his own bargain, and by out bidding each other they taught the Indians to &s;et a higher value on their commodities, and to think them&s;elves cheated when they did not all get the &s;ame prices. This bred a jealou&s;y and &s;owed the &s;eeds of a quarrel with them, which the colo|ny were in a poor condition to maintain, be|ing at variance among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The &s;hallop being again fitted for a trading voyage, whil&s;t Smith was abroad on one of his u&s;ual rambles, and the people being di&s;|contented with the indolence of Ratcliffe, their pre&s;ident, and the long &s;ickne&s;s of Mar|tin; Wingfield and Kendal, who had been di&s;placed, took advantage of Smith's ab&s;ence, and con&s;pired with &s;ome malcontents to run away with the ve&s;&s;el and go to England. Smith returned unexpectedly, and the plot was di&s;covered. To prevent its execution, recour&s;e was had to arms, and Kendal was killed. Another attempt of the &s;ame kind was made by Ratcliffe him&s;elf, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
<PB N="264" REF="026637_0262_0FD10511435F0D68">
Archer; but Smith found means to defeat this al&s;o. He determined to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, the value of which was daily ri&s;ing in his e&s;timation; not only as a &s;ource of wealth to individuals, but as a grand nation|al object; and he knew that great undertak|ings could not be accompli&s;hed without la|bour and per&s;everance.</P>
<P>As the autumn advanced, the waters were covered with innumerable wild fowl; which with the addition of corn, beans, and pump|kins, procured from the Indians, changed hunger into luxury, and abated the rage for abandoning the country. Smith had been once up the river Chickahamony, but becau&s;e he had not penetrated to its &s;ource, exceptions were taken to his conduct as too dilatory. This imputation he determined to remove. In his next voyage, he went &s;o high that he was obliged to cut the trees, which had fall|en into the river, to make his way through as far as his boat could &s;wim. He then left her in a &s;afe place, ordering his men not to quit her until his return; then taking two of them, and two Indians for guides, he proceed|ed in one of their canoes to the meadows at the river's head; and leaving his two men
<PB N="265" REF="026637_0263_0FD10512DB570218">
with the canoe, he went with his Indian guides acro&s;s the meadows. A party of 300 Indians below, had watched the motions of the boat. They fir&s;t &s;urprized the &s;traggling crew, and made one of them pri&s;oner, from whom they learned that Smith was above. They next found the two men, whom he had left with the canoe, a&s;leep by a fire, and killed them; then having di&s;covered Smith, they wounded him in the thigh with an arrow. Finding him&s;elf thus a&s;&s;aulted, and wounded, he bound one of his Indian guides with his garters to his left arm, and made u&s;e of him as a &s;hield, whil&s;t he di&s;patched three of his enemies and wounded &s;ome others. He was retreating to his canoe, when regarding his enemies, more than his foot&s;teps, he &s;udden|ly plunged with his guide into an oozy creek, and &s;tuck fa&s;t in the mud. The Indians a&s;|toni&s;hed at his bravery did not approach him, till almo&s;t dead with cold, he threw away his arms, and begged them to draw him out, which they did and led him to the fire, where his &s;lain companions were lying. This &s;ight admoni&s;hed him what he was to expect. Be|ing revived by their chafing his benumbed limbs, he called for their chief, Opechanka|now,
<PB N="266" REF="026637_0264_0FD10514B7BCFF48">
King of Pamaunkee, to whom he pre|&s;ented his ivory compa&s;s and dial. The vi|brations of the needle, and the fly under the gla&s;s, which they could &s;ee but not touch, afforded them much amu&s;ement; and Smith, having learned &s;omething of their language, partly by means of that, and partly by &s;igns, entertained them with a de&s;cription of the nature and u&s;es of the in&s;trument; and gave them &s;uch a lecture on the motions of the heavens and earth, as amazed them, and &s;u&s;|pended for a time, the execution of their pur|po&s;e. At length, curio&s;ity being &s;atiated, they fa&s;tened him to a tree, and prepared to di&s;patch him with their arrows. At this in|&s;tant, the chief holding up the compa&s;s, which he e&s;teemed as a divinity, they laid a|&s;ide their arms, and forming a military pro|ce&s;&s;ion, led him in triumph to their village Orapaxe. The order of their march was thus: they ranged them&s;elves in a &s;ingle file, the King in the mid&s;t, before him were borne the arms taken from Smith and his compan|ions; next after the King, came the pri&s;oner, held by three &s;tout &s;avages; and on each &s;ide a file of &s;ix. When they arrived at the vil|lage, the old men, women, and children, came
<PB N="267" REF="026637_0265_0FD10515DEE8F6C0">
out to receive them; after &s;ome manoeuvres, which had the appearance of regularity, they formed them&s;elves round the King and his pri&s;oner, into a circle, dancing and &s;inging, adorned with paint, furs, and feathers, bran|di&s;hing their rattles, which were made of the tails of rattle&s;nakes. After three dances, they di&s;per&s;ed, and Smith was conducted to a long hut, guarded by forty men. There he was &s;o plentifully fea&s;ted with bread and veni|&s;on, that he &s;u&s;pected their intention was to fatten and eat him. One of the Indians, to whom Smith had formerly given beads, brought him a garment of furs, to defend him from the cold. Another, who&s;e &s;on was then &s;ick and dying, attempted to kill him, but was prevented by the guard. Smith being conducted to the dying youth, told them that he had a medicine at James-town, which would cure him, if they would let him fetch it; but they had another de&s;ign, which was to &s;urprize the place, and make u&s;e of him as a guide. To induce him to perform this &s;er|vice, they promi&s;ed him his liberty, with as much land, and as many women, as would content him. Smith magnified the difficulty and danger of their attempt, from the ordnance,
<PB N="268" REF="026637_0266_0FD1051835314388">
mines and other defences of the place, which exceedingly terrified them, and to convince them of the truth of what he told them, he wrote on a leaf of his pocket book, an inven|tory of what he wanted, with &s;ome directions to the people at the fort, how to affright the me&s;&s;engers who went to deliver the letter. They returned in three days, reporting the terror, into which they had been thrown, and when they produced the things for which he had written, the whole company were a&s;ton|i&s;hed at the power of his divination by the <HI>&s;peaking leaf.</HI></P>
<P>After this they carried him through &s;everal nations, inhabiting the banks of the Potow|mack and Rapahanock, and at length brought him to Pamaunkee; where they performed a &s;trange ceremony, by which they intended to divine, whether his intentions toward them, were friendly or ho&s;tile. The manner of it was this: early in the morning a great fire was made in a long hou&s;e, and a mat &s;pread on each &s;ide, on one of which he was placed, and the guard retired. Pre&s;ently, an Indian prie&s;t, hideou&s;ly painted, and dre&s;&s;ed in furs and &s;nake &s;kins, came &s;kipping in, and after a variety of uncouth noi&s;es and ge&s;tures, drew a circle
<PB N="269" REF="026637_0267_0FD1051976DAE478">
with meal round the fire. Then came in three more in the &s;ame frightful dre&s;s, and after they had performed their dance, three others. They all &s;at oppo&s;ite to him in a line, the chief prie&s;t in the mid&s;t. After &s;inging a &s;ong, accompanied with the mu&s;ic of their rattles, the chief prie&s;t laid down five grains of corn, and after a &s;hort &s;peech three more; this was repeated till the fire was encircled. Then continuing the incantation, he laid &s;ticks between the divi&s;ions of the corn. The whole day was &s;pent in the&s;e ceremonies, with fa&s;t|ing; and at night a fea&s;t was prepared of the bea&s;t meats which they had. The &s;ame tricks were repeated the two following days. They told him that the circle of meal repre&s;ented their country, the circle of corn the &s;ea &s;hore, and the &s;ticks his country; they did not ac|quaint him, or he has not acquainted us with the re&s;ult of the operation; but he ob&s;erved that the gunpowder, which they had taken from him, was laid up among their corn, to be planted the next &s;pring.</P>
<P>After the&s;e ceremonies, they brought him to the emperor POWHATAN, who received him in royal &s;tate, clothed in a robe of racoon &s;kins, &s;eated on a kind of throne,
<PB N="270" REF="026637_0268_0FD1051B99343D70">
elevated above the floor of a large hut, in the mid&s;t of which was a fire; at each hand of the prince, &s;at two beautiful girls, his daugh|ters, and along each &s;ide of the hou&s;e, a row of his coun&s;ellors, painted and adorned with feathers and &s;hells. At Smith's entrance a great &s;hout was made. The Queen of Apa|matox, brought him water to wa&s;h his hands, and another &s;erved him with a bunch of feathers, in&s;tead of a towel. Having fea&s;ted him after their manner, a long con&s;ultation was held, which being ended, two large &s;tones were brought in, on one of which his head was laid, and clubs were lifted up to beat out his brains. At this critical moment, POCA|HONTAS, the King's favourite daughter, flew to him, took his head in her arms, and laid her own upon it. Her tender intreaties pre|vailed. The king con&s;ented that Smith &s;hould live, to make hatchets for him, and ornaments for her.</P>
<P>Two days after, Powhatan cau&s;ed him to be brought to a di&s;tant hou&s;e; where, after another threatening, he confirmed his promi&s;e, and told him he &s;hould return to the fort, and &s;end him two pieces of cannon, and a grind|&s;tone; for which he would give him the
<PB N="271" REF="026637_0269_0FD1051DFA3F4528">
country of Capahou&s;ick, and forever e&s;teem him as his &s;on. Twelve guides accompani|ed him, and he arrived at James-town, the next day. According to the &s;tipulation, two guns and a large grind&s;tone were offered them. but having in vain tried to lift them, they were content to let them remain in their place. Smith, however, had the guns loaded, and di&s;charged a volley of &s;tones, at a tree cover|ed with icicles. The report and effect con|founded them; but being pacified with a few toys, they returned, carrying pre&s;ents to Powhatan and his daughter, of &s;uch things as gave them entire &s;atisfaction. After this ad|venture, the young prince&s;s, Pocahontas, fre|quently vi&s;ited the plantation, with her attend|ants, and the refre&s;hments which &s;he brought from time to time proved the means of &s;aving many lives, which otherwi&s;e would have been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Smith's return happened at another critical juncture. The colony was divided into parties, and the malcontents, were again preparing to quit the country. His pre&s;ence a third time, defeated the project; in revenge for which they meditated to put him to death, under pretence that he had been the means of murdering the
<PB N="272" REF="026637_0270_0FD1052009170E90">
two men who went with him in the canoe; but by a proper application of valour and &s;trength, he put his accu&s;ers under confine|ment, till an opportunity pre&s;ented for &s;end|ing them as pri&s;oners to England.</P>
<P>The misfortunes and mi&s;managements of this Virginian colony, during the period here related, &s;eem to have originated partly in the tempers and qualifications of the men who were appointed to command, and partly in the nature and circum&s;tances of the adventure. There could be no choice of men for the &s;er|vice, but among tho&s;e who offered them&s;elves; and the&s;e were previou&s;ly &s;trangers to each other, as well as different in their education, qualities and habits. Some of them had been u&s;ed to the command of &s;hips, and partook of the roughne&s;s of the element on which they were bred. It is perhaps, no great compli|ment to Smith, to &s;ay that he was the be&s;t qualified of <HI>them,</HI> for command; &s;ince the event proved that none of them, who &s;urviv|ed the fir&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, had the confidence of the people in any degree. It is certain that his re&s;olution prevented the abandonment of the place the fir&s;t year; his enterprizing &s;pi|rit led to an exploration of the country, and
<PB N="273" REF="026637_0271_0FD1052184ADD0A0">
acquainted them with its many advantages; his captivity produced an intercour&s;e with the &s;avages; and the &s;upplies gained from them, chiefly by means of his addre&s;s, kept the peo|ple alive till the &s;econd arrival of the &s;hips from England. The Virginians, therefore, ju&s;tly regard him, if not as the father, yet as the &s;aviour of that infant plantation.</P>
<P>In the winter of 1607, Capt. Newport ar|rived from England in Virginia. The other &s;hip, commanded by Capt. Nel&s;on, which &s;ail|ed at the &s;ame time, was di&s;ma&s;ted on the American coa&s;t, and blown off to the We&s;t-Indies. The &s;upplies &s;ent by the company were received in Virginia with the mo&s;t cor|dial avidity; but the general licen&s;e given to the &s;ailors, to trade with the &s;avages, proved detrimental to the planters, as it rai&s;ed the prices of their commodities &s;o high, that a pound of copper would not purcha&s;e, what before could be bought for an ounce. New|port him&s;elf was not free from this &s;pirit of profu&s;ion, &s;o common to &s;eafaring men, which he manife&s;ted by &s;ending pre&s;ents of various kinds to Powhatan, intending thereby to give him an idea of the grandeur of the Engli&s;h nation. In a vi&s;it which he made to this
<PB N="274" REF="026637_0272_0FD1052608837568">
prince, under the conduct of Smith, he was received and entertained with an equal &s;how of magnificence; but in trading with the &s;avage chief, he found him&s;elf outwitted. Powhatan, in a lofty &s;train, &s;poke to him thus: "It is not agreeable to the greatne&s;s of &s;uch men as we are, to trade like common people for trifles; lay down therefore at once, all your goods, and I will give you the full value for them." Smith perceived the &s;nare, and warned Newport of it; but he, thinking to out brave the &s;avage prince, di&s;played the whole of his &s;tore. Powhatan then &s;et &s;uch a price on his corn, that not more than four bu&s;hels could be procured; and the nece&s;|&s;ary &s;upplies could not have been had, if Smith's genius, ever ready at invention, had not hit on an artifice which proved &s;ucce&s;sful. He had &s;ecreted &s;ome trifles, and among them a parcel of <HI>blue beads,</HI> which, &s;eemingly in a carele&s;s way, he glanced in the eyes of Pow|hatan. The bait caught him; and he earn|e&s;tly de&s;ired to purcha&s;e them. Smith, in his turn, rai&s;ed the value of them, extolling them as the mo&s;t precious jewels, re&s;embling the colour of the &s;ky, and proper only for the noble&s;t &s;overeigns in the univer&s;e. Powhatan's
<PB N="275" REF="026637_0273_0FD105287A0F4FD0">
imagination was all on fire; he made large offers. Smith in&s;i&s;ted on more, and at length &s;uffered him&s;elf to be per&s;uaded to take be|tween two and three hundred bu&s;hels of corn for about two pounds of blue beads, and they parted in very good humour, each one being very much plea&s;ed with his bargain. In a &s;ub&s;equent vi&s;it to Opecankanough, King of Pamaunkee, the company were entertained with the &s;ame kind of &s;plendor and a &s;imilar bargain clo&s;ed the fe&s;tivity; by which means, the blue beads grew into &s;uch e&s;timation, that none but the princes and their families were able to wear them.</P>
<P>Loaded with this acqui&s;ition, they return|ed to James-town; where an unhappy fire had con&s;umed &s;everal of their hou&s;es, with much of their provi&s;ions and furniture. Mr. Hunt, the chaplain, lo&s;t his apparel and library in this conflagration, and e&s;caped from it with only the clothes on his back. This misfor|tune was &s;everely felt; the &s;hip &s;taying in port fourteen weeks, and re&s;erving enough for the voyage home, &s;o contracted their &s;tock of provi&s;ions, that before the winter was gone, they were reduced to great extremity, and many of them died. The cau&s;e of the &s;hip's
<PB N="276" REF="026637_0274_0FD1052AEF736E30">
detention for &s;o long a time was this: In &s;earching for fre&s;h water in the neighbour|hood of James-town, they had di&s;covered in a rivulet, &s;ome particles of a yellowi&s;h i&s;ing-gla&s;s, which their &s;anguine imaginations had refined into gold du&s;t. The zeal for this pre|cious matter was &s;o &s;trong, that in digging, wa&s;hing and packing it to complete the lading of the &s;hip, all other cares were ab&s;orbed. This was a tedious interval to Capt. Smith; his judgment condemned their folly, his pa|tience was exhau&s;ted, and his pa&s;&s;ion irritated, and the only recompen&s;e which he had for this long vexation was, the plea&s;ure of &s;end|ing home Wingfield and Archer, when the &s;hip departed.</P>
<P>The other &s;hip arrived in the &s;pring, and notwith&s;tanding a long and unavoidable deten|tion in the We&s;t-Indies, brought them a com|fortable &s;upply of provi&s;ions. They took ad|vantage of the opening &s;ea&s;on, to rebuild their hou&s;es and chapel, repair the pali&s;ades, and plant corn for the en&s;uing &s;ummer, in all which works the example and authority of Smith, were of eminent &s;ervice. Every man of activity was fond of him, and tho&s;e of a contrary di&s;po&s;ition were afraid of him. It
<PB N="277" REF="026637_0275_0FD1052D2DECDDD0">
was propo&s;ed that he &s;hould go into the coun|try of the Monacans, beyond the falls of James-river, that they might have &s;ome news of the interior parts to &s;end home to the com|pany; but a fray with the Indians detained him at James-town, till the &s;hip &s;ailed for England, laden chiefly with cedar, but not without another &s;pecimen of the yellow du&s;t, of which Martin was &s;o fond, that he took charge of the packages him&s;elf and returned to England. An acce&s;&s;ion of above one hun|dred men, among whom were &s;everal gold|&s;miths and refiners, had been made to the col|ony, by the two la&s;t &s;hips, and a new mem|ber, Matthew Scrivener, was added to the council.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, and di&s;patched the &s;hip, another voyage of di&s;covery was undertaken by Capt. Smith and fourteen others. They went down the river (June 10, 1608) in an open barge, in company with the &s;hip, and having parted with her at Cape Henry, they cro&s;&s;ed the mouth of the bay, and fell in with a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands without Cape Charles, to which they gave the name of Smith's I&s;les, which they &s;till bear. Then re-entering the bay
<PB N="278" REF="026637_0276_0FD1052F57597A60">
they landed on the ea&s;tern neck, and were kindly received by Acomack, the prince of that penin&s;ula, a part of which &s;till bears his name. From thence they coa&s;ted the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the bay, and landed &s;ometimes on the main, and at other times on the low i&s;lands, of which they found many, but none fit for habitation. They proceeded up the bay to the northward and cro&s;&s;ed over to the we&s;tern &s;hore, down which they coa&s;ted to the &s;outhward, and in this route di&s;covered the mouths of the great rivers, which fall into the bay on that &s;ide. One in particular, at|tracted much of their attention, becau&s;e of a reddi&s;h earth which they found there, and from its re&s;emblance to bole-ammoniac, they gave it the name of Bolus-river, and it is &s;o named in all the early maps of the country; but in the later, it bears the Indian name Pa|tap&s;co; on the north &s;ide of which is now the flouri&s;hing town of <HI>Baltimore.</HI> They &s;ailed thirty miles up the Potowmack, with|out &s;eeing any inhabitants; but on entering a creek found them&s;elves &s;urrounded by In|dians who threatened them. Smith prepared for an encounter; but on firing a few guns, the Indians, terrified at the noi&s;e, made &s;igns
<PB N="279" REF="026637_0277_0FD10531AC32AAB0">
of peace, and exchanged ho&s;tages. One of the company was by this means carried to the habitation of their prince, and the whole were kindly u&s;ed. They learned that it was by direction of Powhatan that the Indians were in arms, and had attempted to &s;urpri&s;e them; from this circum&s;tance they were led to &s;u&s;|pect that Powhatan, had been informed of this expedition, by the di&s;contented part of the colony whom Smith had obliged to &s;tay in the country when they would have de&s;ert|ed it.</P>
<P>It was Smith's invariable cu&s;tom, when he met with the Indians, to put on a bold face, and if they appeared de&s;irous of peace to de|mand their arms, and &s;ome of their children as pledges of their &s;incerity; if they complied, he con&s;idered them as friends; if not, as ene|mies. In the cour&s;e of this voyage, he col|lected &s;ome furs, and di&s;covered &s;ome colour|ed earths, which the &s;avages u&s;ed as paints, but found nothing of the mineral kind. At the mouth of the Rappahanock, the boat grounded, and whil&s;t they were waiting for the tide, they employed them&s;elves in &s;ticking with their &s;words the fi&s;hes which were left on the flats. Smith having &s;tuck his &s;word
<PB N="280" REF="026637_0278_0FD10532DF743348">
into a &s;tingray, the fi&s;h rai&s;ed its tail, and with its &s;harp indented thorn, wounded him in the arm. The wound was extremely painful, and he pre&s;ently &s;welled to that degree, that they expected him to die, and he him&s;elf gave them orders to bury him on a neighbouring i&s;land. But the &s;urgeon, Dr. Ru&s;&s;el, having probed the wound; by the help of a certain oil, &s;o allayed the angui&s;h and &s;welling, that Smith was able to eat part of the fi&s;h for his &s;upper. From this occurrence, the place was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Stingray-Point, which it &s;till bears.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of July, they returned to James-town. Having, with the coloured earths which they had found, di&s;gui&s;ed their boat and &s;treamers, their old companions were alarmed at their approach, with the apprehen|&s;ion of an attack from the Spaniards; this was a trick of Smith's to frighten the old Pre&s;i|dent, who had rioted on the public &s;tores, and was building a hou&s;e in the woods, that he might &s;eclude him&s;elf from the &s;ickly, di&s;con|tented, quarrel&s;ome company. On Smith's arrival, they &s;ignified their de&s;ire of inve&s;ting him with the government. Ratcliffe being depo&s;ed, it fell to him of cour&s;e; and having
<PB N="281" REF="026637_0279_0FD105359538D898">
recommended Scrivener to pre&s;ide in his ab|&s;ence, he entered on another voyage of di&s;cov|ery, being determined to &s;pare no pains for a full exploration of the country.</P>
<P>From the 24th of July, to the 7th of Sep|tember, with twelve men in an open barge, he ranged the bay of Che&s;apeak, as far north|ward as the falls of Su&s;quehannah, entering all the rivers that flow into the bay, and ex|amining their &s;hores. In &s;ome places, the na|tives were friendly, and in others jealous. Their idea of the &s;trange vi&s;itors, was, that they had come "from under the world to take their world from them." Smith's con&s;tant endea|vour, was to pre&s;erve peace with them; but when he could not obtain corn in the way of traffic, he never &s;crupled to u&s;e threats, and in &s;ome ca&s;es, violence, and by one or the other method he prevailed &s;o as to bring home a load of provi&s;ions for his di&s;contented companions, who without his efforts would not have been able to live. Sickne&s;s and death were very frequent, and the late&s;t com|ers, were mo&s;t affected by the di&s;orders of the climate.</P>
<P>Smith was now e&s;tabli&s;hed in the pre&s;iden|cy, by the election of the council and the re|que&s;t
<PB N="282" REF="026637_0280_0FD105368FC78148">
of the company; but the commi&s;&s;ion gave to a majority of the council the whole power. Newport, at his third arrival, brought over two new members, and Ratcliffe having &s;till a &s;eat, though depo&s;ed from the pre&s;iden|cy, Smith was obliged in &s;ome ca&s;es to comply with their opinions, contrary to his own judgment, an in&s;tance of which will now be exhibited.</P>
<P>The Virginia company in London, de|ceived by fal&s;e reports, and mi&s;led by their own &s;anguine imaginations, had conceived an expectation not only of finding precious metals in the country, but of di&s;covering the South Sea, from the mountains at the head of James-river; and it was thought, that the journey thither, might be performed in eight or ten days. For the purpo&s;e of making this capi|tal di&s;covery, they put on board Newport's &s;hip, a barge capable of being taken to pieces, and put together again at plea&s;ure. This barge was to make a voyage to the head of the river, then to be carried in pieces acro&s;s the moun|tains, and to de&s;cend the rivers which were &s;uppo&s;ed to run we&s;tward to the South Sea. To facilitate this plan, it was nece&s;&s;ary to gain the favour of Powhatan, through who&s;e
<PB N="283" REF="026637_0281_0FD10538CCE5F4C8">
country the pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t be made; and as means of winning him, a royal pre&s;ent was brought over, con&s;i&s;ting of a ba&s;on and ewer, a bed and furniture, a chair of &s;tate, a &s;uit of &s;carlet clothes, with a cloak and a crown, all which were to be pre&s;ented to him in due form; and the crown placed on his head, with as much &s;olemnity as po&s;&s;ible. To a per&s;on who knew the country and its inhabitants &s;o well as Smith, this project appeared chimeri|cal, and the means whereby it was to be car|ried on, dangerous. With a &s;mall quantity of copper and a few beads, he could have kept Powhatan in good humour, and made an ad|vantage of it for the colony, whereas a profu|&s;ion of pre&s;ents he knew would but increa&s;e his pride and in&s;olence. The project of travel|ling over unknown mountains with men already weakened by &s;ickne&s;s, and worn out with fatigue, in a hot climate, and in the mid&s;t of enemies, who might ea&s;ily cut off their retreat, was too romantic even for his &s;anguine and adventrous &s;pirit. His opinion upon the matter cannot be expre&s;&s;ed in more pointed language, than he u&s;ed in a letter to the company. "If the quartered boat was burned to a&s;hes, <HI>one</HI> might carry her in a bag,
<PB N="284" REF="026637_0282_0FD1053A6A3C4950">
but as &s;he is, five hundred cannot, to a navi|gable place above the falls." His di&s;&s;ent however was ineffectual, and when he found that the voice of the council was for execut|ing it, he lent his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to effect as much of it as was practicable.</P>
<P>Previou&s;ly to their &s;etting out, he under|took, with four men only, to carry notice to Powhatan of the intended pre&s;ent, and invite him to come to James-town, that he might receive it there. Having travelled by land twelve miles to Werocomoco, on Pamunky (York) river, where he expected to meet Powhatan, and not finding him there, whil&s;t a me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched thirty miles for him; his daughter Pocahontas, entertained Smith and his company with a dance, which for its &s;ingularity, merits a particular de&s;|cription.</P>
<P>In an open plain, a fire being made, the gentlemen were &s;eated by it. Suddenly a noi&s;e was heard in the adjacent wood, which made them fly to their arms, and &s;eize on two or three old men, as ho&s;tages for their own &s;ecurity, imagining that they were betrayed. Upon this the young prince&s;s came running to Smith, and pa&s;&s;ionately embracing him,
<PB N="285" REF="026637_0283_0FD1053C9B489A98">
offered her&s;elf to be killed, if any harm &s;hould happen to him or his company. Her a&s;&s;ur|ances, &s;econded by all the Indians pre&s;ent, removed their fears. The noi&s;e which had alarmed them, was made by thirty girls, who were preparing for the intended ceremony. Immediately they made their appearance, with no other covering than a girdle of green leaves and their &s;kins painted, each one of a different colour. Their leader had a pair of buck's horns on her head, an otter's &s;kin as her gir|dle, and another on one arm; a bow and ar|row in the other hand, and a quiver at her back. The re&s;t of them had horns on their heads, and a wooden &s;word or &s;taff in their hands. With &s;houting and &s;inging, they formed a ring round the fire, and per|formed a circular dance for about an hour, after which they retired in the &s;ame order as they had advanced. The dance was followed by a fea&s;t, at which the &s;avage nymphs were as eager with their care&s;&s;es as with their at|tendance; and this being ended, they con|ducted the gentlemen to their lodging by the light of fire brands.</P>
<P>The next day Powhatan arrived, and Smith delivered the me&s;&s;age from his father, Newport
<PB N="286" REF="026637_0284_0FD1053F27B3BDF8">
(as he always called him) to this effect. "That he had brought him from the King of England, a royal pre&s;ent, and wi&s;hed to &s;ee him at James-town, that he might deliver it to him; promi&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in pro&s;ecut|ing his revenge again&s;t the Monacans, who&s;e country they would penetrate even to the &s;ea beyond the mountains." To which the &s;av|age prince with equal &s;ubtilty and haughti|ne&s;s, an&s;wered, "If your King has &s;ent me a pre&s;ent, I al&s;o am a King, and am on my own land. I will &s;tay here eight days. Your father mu&s;t come to me, I will not go to him, nor to your fort. As for the Monacans, I am able to revenge my&s;elf. If you have heard of &s;alt water beyond the mountains, from any of my people, they have deceived you." Then with a &s;tick he drew a plan of that region on the ground; and after many compliments the conference ended.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent being put on board the boats, was carried down James-river and up the Pa|munkee, whil&s;t Newport, with fifty men, went acro&s;s by land and met the boats, in which he pa&s;&s;ed the river, and held the propo&s;ed inter|view. All things being prepared for the ce|remony of coronation, the pre&s;ent was brought

from the boats; the ba&s;on and ewer were de|po&s;ited, the bed and chair were &s;et up, the &s;carlet &s;uit and cloak were put on, though not till Namontac (an Indian youth whom Newport had carried to England and brought back again) had a&s;&s;ured him that the&s;e habili|ments would do him no harm; but they had great difficulty in per&s;uading him to receive the crown, nor would he bend his knee, or incline his head in the lea&s;t degree. After many attempts, and with actual pre&s;&s;ing on his &s;houlders, they at la&s;t made him &s;toop a little and put it on. In&s;tantly, a &s;ignal being given, the men in the boats fired a volley, at which the monarch &s;tarted with horror, im|agining that a de&s;ign was forming to de&s;troy him in the &s;ummit of his glory; but being a&s;&s;ured that it was meant as a compliment, his fear &s;ub&s;ided, and in return for the baubles of royalty received from King James, he de&s;ired Newport to pre&s;ent him his old fur mantle and deer &s;kin &s;hoes, which in his e&s;timation were doubtle&s;s a full equivalent; &s;ince all this finery could not prevail on the wary chief to allow them guides for the di&s;covery of the in|land country, or to approve their de&s;ign of vi&s;iting it. Thus di&s;appointed they returned

to James-town, determined to proceed with|out his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Smith, who had no mind to go on &s;uch a fruitle&s;s errand, tarried at the fort with eighty invalids to relade the &s;hip, whil&s;t Newport with all the council, and one hundred and twenty of the healthie&s;t men, began their tran&s;montane tour of di&s;covery. They pro|ceeded in their boats to the falls at the head of the river; from thence they travelled up the country two days and a half, and di&s;cover|ed two towns of the Monacans, the inhabit|ants of which &s;eemed very indifferent toward them, and u&s;ed them neither well nor ill. They took one of their petty princes and led him bound to guide them. Having perform|ed this march, they grew weary and returned, taking with them in their way back certain portions of earth, in which their <HI>refiner</HI> pre|tended that he had &s;een &s;igns of &s;ilver. This was all the &s;ucce&s;s of their expedition; for the Savages had concealed their corn, and they could neither per&s;uade them to &s;ell it, nor find it to take it by force. Thus they returned to James-town, tired, di&s;appointed, hungry and &s;ick, and had the additional mortification of being laughed at by Smith for their vain at|tempt.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="026637_0287_0FD105462CBA8FC0">The Virginia company had not only a view to the di&s;covery of the South Sea, but al&s;o to e&s;tabli&s;h manufactures in their colony; and for this purpo&s;e had &s;ent over a number of work|men from Poland and Germany, who were &s;killed in the making pot a&s;hes and gla&s;s, as well as pitch and tar. Had the country been full of people, well cultivated and provided with all nece&s;&s;aries for carrying on the&s;e works, there might have been &s;ome pro&s;pect of ad|vantage; but, in a new region, the principal objects are &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and defence; the&s;e will nece&s;&s;arily occupy the fir&s;t adventurers to the exclu&s;ion of all others. However, Smith was of &s;o generous a di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;o indefatiga|ble in doing what he apprehended to be his duty, and in gratifying his employers, that as &s;oon as Newport returned from his fruitle&s;s attempt to find the South Sea, he &s;et all, who were able, to work, that he might, if po&s;&s;ible, an&s;wer the expectation of the company. Tho&s;e who were &s;killed in the manufactures, he left under the care of the council, to carry on their works; whil&s;t he took thirty of the mo&s;t ac|tive with him, about five miles down the riv|er, to cut timber, and make clapboards; this being, as he well knew, an employment the

mo&s;t certain of &s;ucce&s;s. Among the&s;e were &s;everal young gentlemen, who&s;e hands not having been u&s;ed to labour, were bli&s;tered by the axes, and this occa&s;ioned frequent expre&s;|&s;ions of impatience and profanene&s;s. To puni&s;h them, Smith cau&s;ed the number of every man's oaths to be taken down daily, and at night as many canns of water to be poured in&s;ide his &s;leeve. This di&s;cipline was no le&s;s &s;ingular than effectual; it &s;o le&s;&s;ened the number of oaths, that &s;carcely one was heard in a week, and withal it made them perfectly good humoured, and reconciled them to their labour. At his return to the fort, he found, not only that bu&s;ine&s;s had been neglected, but much provi&s;ion con&s;umed, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to undertake another expe|dition for corn. He, therefore, went up the Chickahamony with two boats and eighteen men, and finding the Indians not in a humour for trading, but rather &s;cornful and in&s;olent, he told them that he had come not &s;o much for corn, as to revenge his impri&s;onment, and the murder of his two men, &s;ome time before. Putting his crew in a po&s;ture of attack, the Indians fled, and pre&s;ently &s;ent me&s;&s;engers to treat of peace; for the obtaining which, he
<PB N="291" REF="026637_0289_0FD1054A16241B28">
made them give him an hundred bu&s;hels of corn, with a quantity of fi&s;h and fowls; and with this &s;upply he kept the colony from &s;tarving, and pre&s;erved the &s;hip's provi&s;ions for her voyage to England. At her depar|ture, &s;he carried &s;uch &s;pecimens as could be had of tar, pitch, turpentine, &s;oap a&s;hes, clap|boards, and wain&s;cot; and at Point Comfort, met with Scrivener, who had been up the Pamaunkee for corn, and had got a quantity of <HI>pocones,</HI> a red root, u&s;ed in dying; the&s;e being taken on board, Capt. Newport returned to England the third time, leaving about two hundred per&s;ons in Virginia.</P>
<P>The harve&s;t of 1608, had fallen &s;hort both among the new planters and the natives; and the colony was indebted to the inventive ge|nius and indefatigable per&s;everance of Smith, for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence during the &s;ucceeding winter. As long as the rivers were open, he kept the boats continually going among the natives, for &s;uch &s;upplies as could be obtain|ed; and he never would return empty, if any thing were to be had by any means in his power. Whil&s;t abroad on the&s;e excur&s;ions, he and his men were obliged frequently to lodge in the woods, when the ground was
<PB N="292" REF="026637_0290_0FD1054C292E6F48">
hard frozen and covered with &s;now; and their mode of accomodating them&s;elves was, fir&s;t to dig away the &s;now and make a fire; when the ground was dried and warmed, they re|moved the fire to one &s;ide, and &s;pread their mats over the warm &s;pot for their bed, u&s;ing another mat as a &s;creen from the wind; when the ground cooled, they &s;hifted the fire again; by thus continually changing their po&s;ition they kept them&s;elves tolerably warm through many cold nights; and it was ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who went on this &s;ervice and &s;ubmitted to the&s;e hard&s;hips, were robu&s;t and healthy, whil&s;t tho&s;e who &s;tayed at home were always weak and &s;ickly.</P>
<P>The &s;upplies procured by trading being in|&s;ufficient, and hunger very pre&s;&s;ing, Smith ventured on the dangerous project of &s;urpriz|ing Powhatan, and carrying off his whole &s;tock of provi&s;ions. This Indian prince, had formed a &s;imilar de&s;ign re&s;pecting Smith; and for the purpo&s;e of betraying him, had in|vited him to his &s;eat, promi&s;ing that if he would &s;end men to build him a hou&s;e, after the Engli&s;h mode, and give him &s;ome guns and &s;words, copper and beads, he would load his boat with corn. Smith &s;ent him three

Dutch carpenters, who treacherou&s;ly revealed to him the de&s;ign which Smith had formed. On his arrival with forty &s;ix men, he found the prince, &s;o much on his guard, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to execute his de&s;ign. Having &s;pent the day in conver&s;ation (in the cour&s;e of which Powhatan had in vain endeavoured to per&s;uade Smith to lay a&s;ide his arms, as being there in perfect &s;ecurity) he retired in the evening and formed a de&s;ign to &s;urprize Smith, and his people at their &s;upper; and had it not been for the affectionate friend&s;hip of Pocahontas, it would probably have been effected. This amiable girl, at the ri&s;que of her life, &s;tole from the &s;ide of her father, and pa&s;&s;ing in the dark through the woods, told Smith with tears in her eyes of the plot, and then as privately returned. When the In|dians brought in the &s;upper, Smith obliged them to ta&s;te of every di&s;h; his arms were in readine&s;s, and his men vigilant; and though there came divers &s;ets of me&s;&s;engers one after another, during the night, under pretence of friendly inquiries, they found them &s;o well prepared, that nothing was attempted, and the party returned in &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="026637_0292_0FD1055207941040">In a &s;ub&s;equent vi&s;it to Opecancanough, by whom he formerly was taken pri&s;oner, this prince put on the &s;emblance of friend&s;hip, whil&s;t his men lay in ambu&s;h with their bows and arrows. The trick being di&s;covered by one of Smith's party and communicated to him, he re&s;olutely &s;eized the King by his hair, and holding a pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t, led him trembling to the ambu&s;h, and there with a torrent of reproachful and menacing words, obliged him to order tho&s;e very people not only to lay down their arms, but to load him with provi&s;ions. After this, they made an at|tempt to murder him in his &s;leep, and to poi|&s;on him, but both failed of &s;ucce&s;s. The chief of Pa&s;piha meeting him alone in the woods, armed only with a &s;word, attempted to &s;hoot him, but he clo&s;ed with the &s;avage, and in the &s;truggle both fell into the river; where, after having narrowly e&s;caped drown|ing, Smith at la&s;t prevailed to gripe him by the throat, and would have cut off his head, but the intreaties of the poor victim prevail|ing on his humanity, he led him pri&s;oner to James-town.</P>
<P>This intrepid behaviour &s;truck a dread into the &s;avages, and they began to believe what
<PB N="295" REF="026637_0293_0FD105546A044190">
he had often told them, that, "his God would protect him again&s;t all their power, whil&s;t he kept his promi&s;e; which was to pre&s;erve peace with them as long as they &s;hould refrain from ho&s;tilities, and continue to &s;upply him with corn." An incident which occurred about the &s;ame time, confirmed their veneration for him. An Indian having &s;tolen a pi&s;tol from James-town, two brothers who were known to be his companions were &s;eiz|ed, and one was held as ho&s;tage for the other, who was to return in twelve hours with the pi&s;tol, or the pri&s;oner was to be hanged. The weather being cold, a charcoal fire was kind|led in the dungeon which was very clo&s;e, and the vapour had &s;o &s;uffocated the pri&s;oner, that on the return of his brother at the appointed time, with the pi&s;tol, he was taken out as dead. The faithful &s;avage lamented his fate in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing agony. Smith, to con|&s;ole him, promi&s;ed, if they would &s;teal no more, that he &s;hould be recovered. On the application of &s;pirits and vinegar, he &s;hewed &s;igns of life, but appeared delirious; this griev|ed the brother as much as his death. Smith undertook to cure him of this al&s;o, on the repetition of the promi&s;e to &s;teal no more.
<PB N="296" REF="026637_0294_0FD10557896F38E0">
The delirium being only the effect of the &s;pi|rits which he had &s;wallowed, was remedied by a few hours &s;leep; and being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with a pre&s;ent of copper, they went away, be|lieving and reporting that Smith was able <HI>to bring the dead to life.</HI> The effect was, that not only many &s;tolen things were recovered, and the thieves puni&s;hed, but that peace and friendly intercour&s;e were pre&s;erved, and corn brought in as long as they had any, whil&s;t Smith remained in Virginia.</P>
<P>He was equally &s;evere and re&s;olute with his own men, and finding many of them inclin|ing to be idle, and this idlene&s;s in a great mea&s;ure the cau&s;e of their frequent &s;ickne&s;&s;es and deaths, he made an order, "that he who would not work &s;hould not eat, unle&s;s he were di&s;abled, by &s;ickne&s;s; and that every one who did not gather as much food in a day as he did him&s;elf, &s;hould be bani&s;hed." A recent attempt having been made, to run away with the boats, he ordered that the next per|&s;on who &s;hould repeat this offence &s;hould be hanged. By firmne&s;s in the execution of the&s;e laws, and by the concurrent force of his own example in labouring continually, and di&s;tributing his whole &s;hare of European pro|vi&s;ions

and refre&s;hments to the &s;ick, he kept the colony in &s;uch order, that, though many of them murmured at his &s;everity, they all be|came very indu&s;trious; and withal &s;o healthy, that, of two hundred per&s;ons, there died that winter and the next &s;pring no more than &s;even. In the &s;pace of three months they had made a quantity of tar, pitch, and pot a&s;hes; had produced a &s;ample of gla&s;s; dug a well in the fort; built twenty new hou&s;es; provided nets and wiers for fi&s;hing; erected a block hou&s;e on the i&s;thmus of James-town; anoth|er on Hog I&s;land; and had begun a fortre&s;s on a commanding eminence. As the &s;pring came on, they paid &s;uch attention to hu&s;band|ry, as to have thirty or forty acres cleared and fit for planting; and a detachment had been &s;ent to the &s;outhward, to look for the long lo&s;t colony of Sir Walter Raleigh, but without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of the Virginia colony, when Captain Samuel Argal arrived on a trad|ing voyage, and brought letters from the com|pany in England, complaining of their di&s;ap|pointment, and blaming Smith as the cau&s;e of it. They had conceived an ill opinion of him, from the per&s;ons whom he had &s;ent

home, who repre&s;ented him as arbitrary and violent toward the coloni&s;ts, cruel to the &s;av|ages, and di&s;po&s;ed to traver&s;e the views of the adventurers, who expected to grow rich very &s;uddenly.</P>
<P>There was this di&s;advantage attending the bu&s;ine&s;s of colonization in North America, at that day, that the only precedents which could be had were tho&s;e of the Spaniards, who had treated the natives with extreme cruelty, and ama&s;&s;ed va&s;t &s;ums of gold and &s;ilver. Whil&s;t the Engli&s;h adventurers dete&s;ted the means by which the Spaniards had acquired their riches, they &s;till expected that the &s;ame kind of riches might be acquired by other means; it was therefore thought politic, to be gentle in de|meanor and lavi&s;h of pre&s;ents toward the na|tives, as an inducement to them to di&s;cover the riches of their country. On the&s;e princi|ples the orders of the Virginia company to their &s;ervants were framed. But experience had taught Smith, the mo&s;t di&s;cerning and faithful of all whom they had employed, that the country of Virginia would not enrich the adventurers in the time and manner which they expected; yet he was far from abandon|ing it as worthle&s;s: his aim, was thoroughly
<PB N="299" REF="026637_0297_0FD1055E27AD0738">
to explore it; and by exploring, he had di&s;cov|ered what advantages might be derived from it; to produce which, time, patience, expen&s;e and labour, were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. He had fairly repre&s;ented the&s;e ideas to his em|ployers, he had &s;pent three years in their &s;er|vice, and from his own ob&s;ervations had drawn and &s;ent them a map of the country; and he had conducted their affairs, as well as the na|ture of circum&s;tances would permit. He had had a di&s;orderly, factious, di&s;contented, di&s;ap|pointed &s;et of men, to control, by the help of a few adherents; in the face of the native lords of the &s;oil, formidable in their numbers and knowledge of the country, ver&s;ed in &s;trat|agem, tenacious of re&s;entment, and jealous of &s;trangers. To court them by pre&s;ents was to acknowledge their &s;uperiority, and inflate their pride and in&s;olence. Though &s;avages, they were men and not children. Though de&s;ti|tute of &s;cience, they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of rea&s;on, and a &s;ufficient degree of art. To know how to manage them, it was nece&s;&s;ary to be per|&s;onally acquainted with them; and it mu&s;t be obvious, that a per&s;on who had re&s;ided &s;everal years among them, and had been a pri&s;oner with them, was a much better judge of the

proper methods of treating them, than a com|pany of gentlemen at &s;everal thou&s;and miles di&s;tance, and who could know them only by report. Smith had, certainly, the intere&s;t of the plantation at heart, and by toil&s;ome expe|rience, had ju&s;t learned how to conduct it; when he found him&s;elf &s;o obnoxious to his employers, that a plan was concerted to &s;uper|&s;ede him, and rein&s;tate, with a &s;hare of autho|rity, tho&s;e whom he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The Virginia Company had applied to the King to recal their patent and grant another; in virtue of which they appointed Thomas Lord de la Warre, general; Sir Thomas Gates, lieutenant general; Sir George Somers, admiral; Sir Thomas Dale, mar&s;hal; Sir Ferdinando Wainman, general of hor&s;e; and Captain Newport, (the only one of them who had &s;een the country) vice-admiral. The ad|venturers having, by the alteration of their pa|tent, acquired a reinforcement both of dignity and property, equipped nine &s;hips; in which were embarked five hundred per&s;ons, men, wom|en and children. Gates, Somers, and Newport, had each a commi&s;&s;ion, inve&s;ting either of them who might fir&s;t arrive, with power to call in the
<PB N="301" REF="026637_0299_0FD0F9955FA48A48">
old and &s;et up the new commi&s;&s;ion. The fleet &s;ailed from England in May 1609, and by &s;ome &s;trange policy the three commanders were em|barked in one &s;hip. This &s;hip being &s;eparated from the others in a &s;torm, was wrecked on the i&s;land of Bermuda; another foundered at &s;ea; and when the remaining &s;even arrived in Virginia, two of which were commanded by Ratcliffe and Archer, they found them&s;elves de&s;titute of authority; though &s;ome of them were full enough of prejudice again&s;t Smith who was then in command. The &s;hips had been greatly &s;hattered in their pa&s;&s;age, much of their provi&s;ion was &s;poiled, many of their people were &s;ick; and the &s;ea&s;on in which they arrived was not the mo&s;t favourable to their recovery. A mutinous &s;pirit &s;oon broke out, and a &s;cene of confu&s;ion en&s;ued; the new comers would not obey Smith, becau&s;e they &s;uppo&s;ed his commi&s;&s;ion to be &s;uper&s;eded; the new commi&s;&s;ion was not arrived, and it was uncertain whether the &s;hip which carried it would ever be &s;een or heard of. Smith would gladly have withdrawn and gone back to Eng|land, but his honor was concerned in main|taining his authority till he &s;hould be regularly &s;uper&s;eded; and his &s;pirit would not &s;uffer him
<PB N="302" REF="026637_0300_0FD0F997F8CB5650">
to be trampled on by tho&s;e whom he de&s;pi&s;ed. Upon due con&s;ideration, he determined to maintain his authority as far as he was able; waiting &s;ome proper opportunity to retire. Some of the mo&s;t in&s;olent of the new comers, "he laid by the heels." With the more moderate he con&s;ulted what was be&s;t to be done; and, as a &s;eparation &s;eemed to be the be&s;t remedy, and it had been in contempla|tion to extend the &s;ettlements, &s;ome were in|duced to go up to the Falls, others to Nan&s;e|mond, and others to Point Comfort. Smith's year being almo&s;t expired, he offered to re&s;ign to Martin, who had been one of the old coun|cil, but Martin would not accept the com|mand; he, therefore, kept up the form; and, as much as he could, of the power of govern|ment; till an accident which had nearly proved fatal to his life, obliged him to return to England.</P>
<P>On his return from the new plantation at the Falls; &s;leeping by night in his boat; a bag of gun powder took fire, and burnt him in a mo&s;t terrible manner. Awaking in &s;urpri&s;e, and finding him&s;elf wrapt in flames, he leaped into the water, and was almo&s;t drowned, before his companions could recover
<PB N="303" REF="026637_0301_0FD1055FC9440E18">
him. At his return to James-town, in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition, Ratcliffe and Archer con|&s;pired to murder him in his bed; but the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, whom they employed, had not courage to fire a pi&s;tol. Smith's old &s;oldiers would have taken off their heads; but he thought it prudent to pa&s;s by the offence, and take this opportunity, as there was no &s;urgeon in the country, of returning to England. As &s;oon as his intention was known, the council appointed Mr. Percie to pre&s;ide in his room; and detained the &s;hip three weeks, till they could write letters, and frame complaints again&s;t him. He at length &s;ailed for England, about the latter end of September 1609; much regreted by his few friends, one of whom has left this character of him. "In all his proceedings he made ju&s;tice his fir&s;t guide, and experience his &s;econd; hating ba&s;ene&s;s, &s;loth, pride, and indignity, more than any dangers. He never would allow more for him&s;elf than for his &s;oldiers; and upon no danger would &s;end them where he would not lead them him&s;elf. He would never &s;ee us want what he had, or could by any means get for us. He would rather want than bor|row; or &s;tarve, than not pay. He loved action more than words; and hated covetou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="304" REF="026637_0302_0FD10561D8CA2160">
and fal&s;ehood wor&s;e than death. His adven|tures were our lives; and his lo&s;s our deaths."</P>
<P>There needs no better te&s;timony to the truth of this character, than what is related of the mi&s;erable colony after he had quitted it. Without government, without prudence, carele&s;s, indolent, and factious, they became a prey to the in&s;olence of the natives, to the di&s;ea&s;es of the climate and to famine. With|in &s;ix months, their number was reduced from five hundred to &s;ixty; and when the three commanders, who had been wrecked on Ber|muda, arrived (1610) with one hundred and fifty men in two &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, which they had built out of the ruins of their &s;hip, and the cedars which grew on the i&s;land; they found the remnant of the colony in &s;uch a forlorn condition; that without he&s;itation, they de|termined to abandon the country, and were &s;ailing down the river; when they met a boat from the Lord De la Warre, who had come with a fleet to their relief. By his per&s;ua&s;ion they re&s;umed the plantation, and to this for|tunate incident, may be a&s;cribed the full e&s;|tabli&s;hment of the colony of Virginia.</P>
<P>Such a genius as Smith's could not remain idle. He was well known in England, and
<PB N="305" REF="026637_0303_0FD10562CF4D9A40">
the report of his valour, and his &s;pirit of ad|venture, pointed him out to a number of merchants, who were engaged in the Ameri|can fi&s;hery, as a proper per&s;on to make di&s;cov|eries on the coa&s;t of North Virginia. In April 1614, he &s;ailed from London with two &s;hips, and arrived at the i&s;land of Monahigon in latitude 43&deg;&frac12;, as it was then computed, where he built &s;even boats. The de&s;ign of the voyage was to take whales, to examine a mine of gold, and another of copper, which were &s;aid to be there; and if either, or both of the&s;e &s;hould fail, to make up the cargo with fi&s;h and furs. The mines proved a fic|tion, and by long cha&s;ing the whales to no purpo&s;e, they lo&s;t the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for fi&s;hing; but whil&s;t the &s;eamen were engaged in the&s;e &s;ervices; Smith, in one of his boats, with eight men, ranged the coa&s;t, ea&s;t and we&s;t, from Penob&s;cot to Cape Cod; bartering with the natives for beaver and other furs, and making ob&s;ervations on the &s;hores, i&s;lands, harbours, and head lands, which, at his re|turn to England, he wrought into a map, and pre&s;enting it to prince Charles, (afterward the <HI>royal martyr</HI>) with a reque&s;t that he would give the country a name, it was for the fir&s;t time
<PB N="306" REF="026637_0304_0FD105657098F6B8">
called <HI>New-England.</HI> The prince al&s;o made &s;everal alterations in the names which Smith had given to particular places. For in&s;tance, he had called the name of that promontory, which forms the ea&s;tern entrance of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts bay, Tragabigzanda; after the name of the Turki&s;h lady to whom he had been formerly a &s;lave at Con&s;tantinople; and the three i&s;lands which lie off the Cape, the Turks Head, in memory of his victory over the three Turki&s;h champions, in his Tran&s;yl|vanian adventures. The former, Charles, in filial re&s;pect to his mother, called Cape Anne, which name it has ever &s;ince retained; the name of the i&s;lands has long &s;ince been lo&s;t; and another clu&s;ter to which he gave his own name, Smith's I&s;les, and which name the prince did not alter, are now, and have for more than a century been called the I&s;les of Shoals; &s;o that the mo&s;t pointed marks of his di&s;coveries on the coa&s;t of New-England, have, either by his own complai&s;ance to the &s;on of his &s;overeign, or by force of time and acci|dents become ob&s;olete. When he &s;ailed for England in one of the &s;hips, he left the other behind, to complete her lading, with orders to &s;ell the fi&s;h in Spain. The ma&s;ter, Thomas

Hunt, decoyed twenty four of the natives on board, and &s;old them in Spain for &s;laves. The memory of this ba&s;e tran&s;action was long pre&s;erved among the Americans, and &s;ucceed|ing adventurers &s;uffered on account of it.</P>
<P>At Smith's return to England he put in at Plymouth; where relating his adventures, and communicating his &s;entiments to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, he was introduced to the Plymouth Company of adventurers to North Virginia, and engaged in their &s;ervice. At London he was invited by the South Virginia company to return to their &s;ervice; but made u&s;e of his engagement with the Plymouth adventurers as an excu&s;e for declining their invitation. From this circum&s;tance it &s;eems, that they had been convinced of his former fidelity, notwith&s;tanding the letters and re|ports which they had formerly received to his di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>During his &s;tay in London, he had the very &s;ingular plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his friend Pocahontas, the daughter of Powhatan. Hav|ing been made a pri&s;oner in Virginia, &s;he was there married to Mr. John Rolfe, and by him was brought to England. She was then about twenty two years of age; her per&s;on
<PB N="308" REF="026637_0306_0FD1056929C5EC88">
was graceful, and her deportment gentle and plea&s;ing. She had been taught the Engli&s;h language and the Chri&s;tian religion, and bap|tized by the name of Rebecca. She had heard that Smith was dead, and knew nothing to the contrary, till &s;he arrived in England.</P>
<P>The fame of an Indian prince&s;s excited great curio&s;ity in London; and Smith had the ad|dre&s;s to write a hand&s;ome letter to the Queen, &s;etting forth the merits of his friend, and the eminent &s;ervices &s;he had done to him and the colony of Virginia. She was introduced by the lady De la Warre; the Queen and royal family received her with much complacency, and &s;he proved her&s;elf worthy of their notice and re&s;pect. At her fir&s;t interview with Smith &s;he called him father; and becau&s;e he did not immediately return the &s;alutation and call her child, &s;he was &s;o overcome with grief, that &s;he hid her face and would not &s;peak for &s;ometime. She was ignorant of the ridiculous affectation which reigned in the court of James; which forbad Smith a&s;&s;um|ing the title of father, to the daughter of a King; and when informed of it &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed it; pa&s;&s;ionately declaring, that &s;he loved him as a father, and had treated him as &s;uch in
<PB N="309" REF="026637_0307_0FD1056B07C66AE0">
her own country, and would be his child wherever &s;he went. The &s;ame pedantic af|fectation cau&s;ed her hu&s;band to be looked upon as an offender, for having, though a &s;ubject, invaded the my&s;terious rights of royalty in marrying above his rank. This marriage, however, proved beneficial to the colony, as her father had thereby become a friend to them, and when &s;he came to England, he &s;ent with her Uttamaccomac, one of his tru&s;ty coun&s;ellors; whom he enjoined to inquire for Smith, and tell him whether he was alive. Another order which he gave him was, to bring him the number of people in England; accordingly, on his landing at Plymouth, the obedient &s;avage began his account by cutting a notch on a long &s;tick for every per&s;on whom he &s;aw; but &s;oon grew tired of his employ|ment, and at his return told Powhatan that they exceeded the number of leaves on the trees. A third command from his prince was, to &s;ee the God of England, and the King, Queen, and Princes, of whom Smith had told him &s;o much; and when he met with Smith, he de&s;ired to be introduced to tho&s;e per&s;onages. He had before this &s;een the King, but would not believe it; becau&s;e
<PB N="310" REF="026637_0308_0FD1056D4735BBD0">
the per&s;on whom they pointed out to him had not given him any thing. "You gave Pow|hatan (&s;aid he to Smith) a white dog, but your King has given me nothing." Mr. Rolfe was preparing to return with his wife to Virginia, when &s;he was taken ill and died at Grave&s;end; leaving an infant &s;on, Thomas Rolfe, from whom are de&s;cended &s;everal fam|ilies of note in Virginia, who hold their lands by inheritance from her.</P>
<P>Smith had conceived &s;uch an idea of the value and importance of the American conti|nent, that he was fully bent on the bu&s;ine&s;s of plantation, rather than fi&s;hing and trading for furs. In this he agreed with his friend Sir Ferdinando Gorges, and the few other active members of the council of Plymouth, but it had become an unpopular theme. One colo|ny had been driven home from Sagadahock by the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on and the deaths of their leaders. Men who were fit for the bu&s;ine&s;s were not ea&s;ily to be obtained, tho&s;e who had formerly been engaged were di&s;cour|aged, and it required great &s;trength of mind as well as liberality of pur&s;e, to &s;et on foot another experiment. After much trouble in endeavouring to unite per&s;ons of oppo&s;ite in|tere&s;ts,
<PB N="311" REF="026637_0309_0FD1056E68C45B08">
and &s;timulate tho&s;e who had &s;u&s;tained former lo&s;&s;es, to new attempts, he obtained one &s;hip of two hundred tons, and another of fifty, with which he &s;ailed in 1615. Hav|ing proceeded about one hundred and twenty leagues, they were &s;eparated in a &s;torm; the &s;maller one commanded by Capt. Thomas Dermer pur&s;ued her voyage; but Smith hav|ing lo&s;t his ma&s;ts was obliged to put back under a jury ma&s;t to Plymouth. There he put his &s;tores on board a &s;mall bark of &s;ixty tons, and thirty men, of whom &s;ixteen were to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in beginning a new colony.</P>
<P>Meeting with an Engli&s;h pirate, his men would have had him &s;urrender; but though he had only four guns, and the pirate thirty &s;ix, he di&s;dained to yield. On &s;peaking with her, he found the commander and &s;ome of the crew to be his old &s;hipmates, who had run away with the &s;hip from Tunis, and were in di&s;tre&s;s for provi&s;ions; they offered to put them&s;elves under his command, but he reject|ed the propo&s;al and went on his voyage. Near the We&s;tern I&s;lands he fell in with two French pirates; his men were again thrown into a panic, and would have &s;truck, but he threatened to blow up the &s;hip, if they would
<PB N="312" REF="026637_0310_0FD10570A1937968">
not fight; and by firing a few running &s;hot, he e&s;caped them al&s;o. After this he was met by four French men of war, who had orders from their &s;overeign to &s;eize pirates. He &s;howed them his commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eal; but they prefidiou&s;ly detained him whil&s;t they &s;uffered his &s;hip to e&s;cape in the night, and return to Plymouth. They knew his enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, and were afraid of his mak|ing a &s;ettlement in New-England, &s;o near to their colony of <HI>Acadia</HI>; and they &s;u&s;|pected, or at lea&s;t pretended to &s;u&s;pect, that he was the per&s;on who hod broken up their fi&s;hery at Port Royal (which was really done by Captain Argal) the year before.</P>
<P>When their crui&s;e was fini&s;hed, they carried him to Rochelle; and notwith&s;tanding their promi&s;es to allow him a &s;hare of the prizes which they had taken whil&s;t he was with them, they kept him as a pri&s;oner on board a &s;hip at anchor. But a &s;torm ari&s;ing, which drove all the people below, he took the boat, with an half pike for an oar, thinking to make his e&s;cape in the night. The current was &s;o &s;trong that he drifted to &s;ea, and was near peri&s;hing. By the turn of the tide he got a&s;hore, on a mar&s;hy i&s;land, where &s;ome
<PB N="313" REF="026637_0311_0FD10573A2B17458">
fowlers found him in the morning almo&s;t dead with cold and hunger. He gave them his boat to carry him to Rochelle, where he learned that the &s;hip which had taken him, with one of her prizes, which was very rich, had been driven on &s;hore in that &s;torm, and lo&s;t, with her Captain and one half of the men.</P>
<P>Here he made his complaint to the judge of the Admiralty, and produced &s;uch evidence in &s;upport of his allegations, that he was treat|ed with fair words; but it does not appear that he got any recompence. He met here and at Bourdeaux with many friends, both French and Engli&s;h, and at his return to Eng|land, publi&s;hed in a &s;mall quarto, an account of his two la&s;t voyages, with the depo&s;itions of the men who were in the &s;hip when he was taken by the French. To this book he prefixed his map of New-England; and in it gave a de&s;cription of the country, with its many advantages, and the proper methods of rendering it a valuable acqui&s;ition to the Eng|li&s;h dominions. When it was printed, he went all over the we&s;t of England, giving copies of it to all per&s;ons of note; and en|deavouring to excite the nobility, gentry, and
<PB N="314" REF="026637_0312_0FD10575D9753A28">
merchants, to engage with earne&s;tne&s;s in the bu&s;ine&s;s of colonizing America. He obtained from many of them fair promi&s;es, and was complimented by the Plymouth company with the title of Admiral of New-England. But the former ill &s;ucce&s;s of &s;ome too &s;anguine ad|venturers, had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion, and a va|riety of cro&s;s incidents, baffled all his attempts.</P>
<P>However, his experience and advice were of eminent &s;ervice to others. The open frank|ne&s;s and genero&s;ity of his mind led him to give all the encouragement which he could to the bu&s;ine&s;s of fi&s;hing and planting in New-England; for which purpo&s;e, in 1622, he publi&s;hed a book, entitled, "New-England's Tryals" &s;ome extracts from which are pre&s;erv|ed by Purchas.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. v, p. 1837.</NOTE> No man rejoiced more than him&s;elf in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the colo|nies of Plymouth and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
<P>When the news of the ma&s;&s;acre of the Vir|ginian planters by the Indians, 1622, arrived in England, Smith was all on fire to go over to revenge the in&s;ult. He made an offer to the company that if they would allow him one hundred &s;oldiers and thirty &s;ailors, with the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions and equipments, he would range the country, keep the natives in
<PB N="315" REF="026637_0313_0FD105786E3DCC90">
awe, protect the planters, and make di&s;cover|ies, of the hitherto unknown parts of Ameri|ca; and for his own ri&s;que and pains would de&s;ire nothing but what he would "produce from the proper labour of the &s;avages." On this propo&s;al the company was divided, but the pu&s;illanimous and avaricious party pre|vailed; and gave him this an&s;wer, "that the charges would be be too great; that their &s;tock was reduced; that the planters ought to defend them&s;elves; but, that if he would go at his own expen&s;e, they would give him <HI>leave,</HI> provided he would give them one half of the <HI>pillage.</HI>" Such an an&s;wer could be re|ceived only with contempt.</P>
<P>When the King in 1624, in&s;tituted a com|mi&s;&s;ion for the reformation of Virginia, Smith, by de&s;ire of the commi&s;&s;ioners, gave in a re|lation of his former proceedings in the colony, and his opinion and advice re&s;pecting the proper methods of remedying the defects in government, and carrying on the plantation with a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agreeably to Smith's advice to the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, King Charles I. at his acce&s;&s;ion di&s;&s;olved the company, in 1626, and re+duced the colony under the immediate direction of the crown, ap+pointing the governor and council, and ordering all patents and proce&s;&s;es to i&s;&s;ue in his own name.</NOTE> The&s;e with ma|ny

other papers he collected and publi&s;hed, in 1627, in a thin folio, under the title of, "The General Hi&s;tory of Virginia, New-England, and the Somer I&s;les." The narrative part is made up of journals and letters of tho&s;e who were concerned with him in the plantation, intermixed with his own ob&s;ervations. His intimate friend, Mr. Purchas, had publi&s;h|ed mo&s;t of them two years before in his "Pil|grims."</P>
<P>In 1629, at the reque&s;t of Sir Robert Cot|ton, he publi&s;hed a hi&s;tory of the early part of his life, entitled, "The true Travels, Adven|tures and Ob&s;ervations of Capt. John Smith." This work is pre&s;erved intire, in the &s;econd volume of Churchill's collections, and from it, the former part of this account is compiled. In the conclu&s;ion he made &s;ome addition to the hi&s;tory of Virginia, Bermuda, New-Eng|land and the We&s;t Indies, re&s;pecting things which had come to his knowledge, after the publication of his general hi&s;tory. He &s;tated the inhabitants of Virginia in 1628 at five thou&s;and, and their cattle about the &s;ame number. Their produce was chiefly tobacco; but tho&s;e few who attended to their gardens had all &s;orts of fruit and vegetables in great
<PB N="317" REF="026637_0315_0FD1057E85AFB428">
abundance and perfection. From New-Eng|land, they received &s;alted fi&s;h; but of fre&s;h fi&s;h their own rivers produced enough, be&s;ide an infinite quantity of fowl; as their woods did of deer and other game. They had two brew hou&s;es; but they cultivated the Indian corn, in preference to the European grain. Their plantations were &s;cattered; &s;ome of their hou&s;es were pali&s;aded; but they had no fortifications nor ordnance mounted.</P>
<P>His account of New-England is, that the country had been repre&s;ented by adventurers from the we&s;t of England, as rocky, barren and de&s;olate; but that, &s;ince his account of it had been publi&s;hed, the credit of it was &s;o rai&s;ed, that forty or fifty &s;ail went thither an|nually on fi&s;hing and trading voyages. That nothing had been done to any purpo&s;e in e&s;tabli&s;hing a plantation, till "about an hun|dred Browni&s;ts went to New-Plymouth; who&s;e humorous ignorance cau&s;ed them to endure a wonderful deal of mi&s;ery, with infi|nite patience."</P>
<P>He then recapitulates the hi&s;tory of his American adventures in the following terms. "Now to conclude the travels and adven|tures of Captain Smith: How fir&s;t he plant|ed

<P>This was probably his la&s;t publication, for he lived but two years after. By a note in Jo&s;&s;elyn's voyage, it appears that he died in 1631, at London, in the fifty &s;econd year of his age.</P>
<P>It would give &s;ingular plea&s;ure to the com|piler of the&s;e memoirs, if he could learn from any credible te&s;timony, that Smith ever receiv|ed any recompence for his numerous &s;ervices and &s;ufferings. The &s;en&s;e which he had of this matter, in 1627, &s;hall be given in his own words. "I have &s;pent five years, and more than five hundred pounds, in the &s;er|vice of Virginia and New England, and in neither of them have I one foot of land, nor the very hou&s;e I built, nor the ground I dig|ged with my own hands; but I &s;ee tho&s;e countries &s;hared before me by tho&s;e who know them only by my de&s;criptions."</P>

<P>AFTER the di&s;covery of Canada, by Cartier, the French continued trading to that country for furs, and fi&s;hing on the banks of Newfoundland, Cape Breton and Acadia; where they found many excellent and conve|nient harbours, among which Can&s;eau was early di&s;tingui&s;hed as a place extremely &s;uita|ble for the fi&s;hery.

The King had them brought before him in their &s;eal &s;kin habits and long beards. He pardoned their former crimes, and made each of them a pre&s;ent of fifty crowns. When they di&s;covered the fraud of the fi&s;herman, they in&s;tituted a pro|ce&s;s again&s;t him at law, and recovered large damages; by means of which they acquired &s;o much property as to enter into the &s;ame kind of traffic.</P>

<P>The next voyager of any note was SAMUEL CHAMPLAIN, of Brouage; a man of a noble family; who, in 1603, &s;ailed up the river of Canada, as far as Cartier had gone in 1535. He made many inquiries of the natives con|cerning

patent was publi&s;hed in all the maritime towns of France; and De Monts having equipped two ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed for his new government on the &s;eventh of March, 1604; taking with him the afore&s;aid Samuel Champlain for a pilot, and Mon&s;ieur DE POUTRINCOURT who had been for a long time de&s;irous to vi&s;it America.</P>
<P>On the 6th of May, they arrived at a har|bour on the S. E. &s;ide of the penin&s;ula of Acadia where they found one of their countrymen, Ro&s;&s;ignol, trading with the Indians without licence. They &s;eized his &s;hip and cargo; leaving him only the poor con&s;olation, of giv|ing his name to the harbour where he was taken; the provi&s;ions found in his &s;hip were a &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply, and without them the en|terprize mu&s;t have been abandoned. This place is now called Liverpool.</P>
<P>From Port Ro&s;&s;ignol they coa&s;ted the pen|in&s;ula to the S. W. and having doubled Cape Sable came to anchor in the bay of St. Mary, where Aubry, a prie&s;t, going a&s;hore, was lo&s;t in the woods, and a prote&s;tant was charg|ed with having murdered him, becau&s;e they had &s;ometimes had warm di&s;putation on re|ligious &s;ubjects. They waited for him &s;ever|al

days, firing guns and &s;ounding trumpets, but in vain; the noi&s;e of the &s;ea was &s;o great that no other &s;ound could be heard. Con|cluding that he was dead, they quitted the place after &s;ixteen days; intending to examine that exten&s;ive bay on the we&s;t of the penin&s;u|la to which they gave the name of La Baye Francoi&s;e; but which is now called the Bay of Funda. The prie&s;t was afterward found alive, but almo&s;t &s;tarved to death.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;tern &s;ide of this bay they di&s;cov|ered a narrow &s;trait, into which they entered, and &s;oon found them&s;elves in a &s;pacious ba|&s;on, invironed with hills, from which de|&s;cended &s;treams of fre&s;h water; and between the hills ran a fine navigable river, which they called L'Equille. It was bordered with fertile meadows, and full of delicate fi&s;h. Poutrin|court, charmed with the beauty of the place, determined here to take his re&s;idence, and having received a grant of it from De Monts, gave it the name of Port Royal. [Anna|polis.]</P>
<P>From Port Royal, De Monts &s;ailed farther into the great bay, to vi&s;it a copper mine. It was a high rock, on a promontory, between two bays. [Menis.] The copper, though
<PB N="326" REF="026637_0324_0FD105982C865C78">
mixed with &s;tone, was very pure; re&s;embling that called Rozette copper. Among the&s;e &s;tones they found chry&s;tals and a certain &s;hin|ing &s;tone of a blue colour. Specimens of the&s;e &s;tones were &s;ent to the King.</P>
<P>In farther examining the bay they came to a great river which they called St. John's; full of i&s;lands and &s;warming with fi&s;h. Up this river they &s;ailed fifty leagues, and were extremely delighted with the va&s;t quantity of grapes which grew on its banks. By this river they imagined that a &s;horter communica|tion might be had with the Baye de Chaleur and the port of Tadou&s;ac, than by the &s;ea.</P>
<P>From the river St. John they coa&s;ted the bay, &s;outhwe&s;terly, till they came to an i&s;land in the middle of a river which Champlain had previou&s;ly explored. Finding its &s;ituation &s;afe and convenient, De Monts re&s;olved there to build a fort and pa&s;s the winter. To this i&s;land he gave the name of St. Croix;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This is a &s;tation of much importance. It has given ri&s;e to a controver&s;y, between the United States and the Briti&s;h govern|ment, which is not yet terminated. I &s;hall therefore give a de|&s;cription of this i&s;land and its &s;urrounding waters, from a tran&s;la|tion of <HI>Mark Le&s;carbot's</HI> hi&s;tory of the voyages of De Monts, in which he him&s;elf was engaged, and therefore had &s;een the place which he de&s;cribes. This tran&s;lation is to be found at large in Churchill's Collections, vol. viii, 796, and an abridgement of it in Purchas's Pilgrims, vol. v, 1619.</P>
<P>"Leaving St. John's river, they came, following the coa&s;t twenty leagues from that place, to <HI>a great river,</HI> which is proper|ly <HI>&s;ea,</HI> [i. e. &s;alt water] where they fortified them&s;elves in <HI>a lit|tle i&s;land</HI> &s;eated in the mid&s;t of this river, which the &s;aid Cham|plain had been to di&s;cover and view. And, &s;eeing it &s;trong by nature, and of ea&s;y defence and keeping; be&s;ides that the &s;ea&s;on began to &s;lide away, and therefore it was behoveful to provide of lodging, without running any farther, they re&s;olved to make their abode there.</P>
<P>"Before we &s;peak of the &s;hip's return to France, it is meet to tell you, how <HI>hard</HI> the i&s;le of St. Croix is <HI>to be found out,</HI> to them that were never there. For there are &s;o many i&s;les and great bays to go by [from St. John's] before one be at it, that I won|der how one might ever pierce &s;o far as to find it. There are <HI>three or four mountains,</HI> imminent above the others, <HI>on the &s;ides</HI>; but on the <HI>north &s;ide</HI> from whence the river runneth down, there is but <HI>a &s;harp pointed one, above two leagues di&s;tant.</HI> The woods of the main land are fair and admirable high, and well grown, as in like manner is the gra&s;s. There is right <HI>over again&s;t the i&s;land fre&s;h water brooks,</HI> very plea&s;ant and agreeable; where divers of Mon&s;. De Monts men did their bu&s;ine&s;s, and builded there, certain cabbins. As for the nature of the ground it is mo&s;t excellent, and mo&s;t abundantly fruitful. For the &s;aid Mon&s;. De Monts having cau&s;ed there &s;ome piece of ground to be tilled, and the &s;ame &s;owed with rye; he was not able to tarry for the maturity thereof to reap it; and notwith&s;tanding, the grain fallen hath grown and increa&s;ed &s;o wonderfully, that two years af|ter, we reaped and did gather of it as fair, big and weighty as in France, which the &s;oil hath brought forth without any tillage; and yet at this pre&s;ent [1609] it doth continue &s;till to multiply every year.</P>
<P>"The &s;aid i&s;land containeth &s;ome <HI>half a league in circuit,</HI> and at the end of it, on the &s;ea &s;ide, there is a mount, or <HI>&s;mall hill,</HI> which is, as it were, <HI>a little i&s;le, &s;evered from the other,</HI> where Mon&s;. De Monts his cannon were placed. There is al&s;o a little chappel, built after the &s;avage fa&s;hion. At the foot of which chappel there is &s;uch <HI>&s;tore of mu&s;cles</HI> as is wonderful, which may be gathered at low water, but they are &s;mall.</P>
<P>"Now let us prepare and hoi&s;t up &s;ails. Mon&s;. de Poutrin|court made the voyage into the&s;e parts, with &s;ome men of good &s;ort, not to winter there; but as it were to &s;eek out his &s;eat, and find out a land that might like him. Which he having done, had no need to &s;ojourne there any longer. So then, the &s;hips being ready for the return, he &s;hipped him&s;elf, and tho&s;e of his compa|ny in one of them.</P>
<P>"During the fore&s;aid navigation, Mon&s;. De Monts his people, did work about the <HI>fort;</HI> which he &s;eated <HI>at the end of the i&s;l|and,</HI> oppo&s;ite to the place where he had lodged his cannon. Which was wi&s;ely con&s;idered, to the end <HI>to command the river up and down.</HI> But there was an inconvenience; the &s;aid fort did lie toward the north, and without any &s;helter, but of the trees that were on the i&s;le &s;hore, which all about he commanded to be kept and not cut down.</P>
<P>"The mo&s;t urgent things being done, and hoary &s;nowy father being come, that is to &s;ay winter, then they were forced to keep within doors, and to live every one at his own home. During which time, our men had three &s;pecial di&s;commodities, in this i&s;l|and, want of wood, (for that which was in the &s;aid i&s;le was &s;pent in buildings) <HI>lack of fre&s;h water,</HI> and the continual watch made by night, fearing &s;ome &s;urprize from the &s;avages, that had lodged them&s;elves, at the foot of the &s;aid i&s;land, or &s;ome other enemy. For the malediction and rage of many chri&s;tians is &s;uch, that one mu&s;t take heed of them much more than of infidels. When they had need of water or wood, they were con&s;trained to cro&s;s over the river, which is <HI>thrice as broad of every &s;ide as the river of Seine.</HI>"</P>
<P>By a gentleman who re&s;ided &s;everal years in tho&s;e parts, I have been informed, that an i&s;land which an&s;wers to this de&s;cription, lies in the <HI>ea&s;tern</HI> part of the bay of Pa&s;&s;amaquoddy; and there the river St. Croix was &s;uppo&s;ed to be, by the commi&s;&s;ioners who ne|gociated the peace in 1783, who had Mitchel's map before them; but, in a map of the coa&s;t of New England and Nova Scotia, pub|li&s;hed in London, 1787, by Robert Sayer, and &s;aid to be drawn by Capt. Holland, the river St. Croix is laid down at the <HI>we&s;tern</HI> part of the bay; the breadth of which is about &s;ix or &s;even leagues.</P></NOTE> be|cau&s;e
<PB N="327" REF="026637_0325_0FD1059A20F03C58">
that two leagues higher there were brooks which "came cro&s;s-wi&s;e to fall with|in this large branch of the &s;ea."</P>
<P>The winter proved &s;evere, and the people &s;uffered &s;o much by the &s;curvy, that thir|ty &s;ix of them died; the remaining forty, who were all &s;ick, lingered till the &s;pring (1605) when they recovered by means of the fre&s;h vegetation. The remedy which Cartier had found in Canada was here unknown.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="026637_0326_0FD1059BD5B13130">As &s;oon as his men were recovered, De Monts re&s;olved to &s;eek a comfortable &s;tation in a warmer climate. Having victualled and armed his pinnace he &s;ailed along the coa&s;t to Norombega, a name which had been given by &s;ome European adventurers to the bay of Penob&s;cot; from thence he &s;ailed to Kenne|bec, Ca&s;co, Saco, and finally came to Male|barre, as Cape Cod was then called by the
<PB N="329" REF="026637_0327_0FD1059D88577F80">
French. In &s;ome of the places which he had pa&s;&s;ed, the land was inviting; and par|ticular notice was taken of the grapes; but the &s;avages appeared numerous, unfriendly and thievi&s;h: De Monts' company being &s;mall, he preferred &s;afety to plea&s;ure, and returned fir&s;t to St. Croix, and then to Port Royal; where he found Dupont, in a &s;hip from France, with fre&s;h &s;upplies and a reinforcement of
<PB N="330" REF="026637_0328_0FD105A028C6A8E0">
forty men. The &s;tores which had been de|po&s;ited at St. Croix were removed acro&s;s the bay, but the buildings were left &s;tanding. New hou&s;es were erected at the mouth of the river, which runs into the ba&s;on of Port Royal; there the &s;tores and people were lodged; and De Monts having put his affairs in as good order as po&s;&s;ible, in the month of September embarked for France; leaving Dupont as his lieutenant, with Champlain, and Champdore to perfect the &s;ettlement, and explore the country.</P>
<P>During the next winter they were plentifully &s;upplied by the &s;avages with veni&s;on, and a great trade was carried on for furs. Nothing is &s;aid of the &s;curvy; but they had &s;hort al|lowance of bread; not by rea&s;on of any &s;carc|ity of corn but becau&s;e they had no other mill to grind it than the hand mill, which re|quired
<PB N="331" REF="026637_0329_0FD105A1CA1FDF88">
hard and continual labour. The &s;av|ages were &s;o aver&s;e to this exerci&s;e, that they preferred hunger to the ta&s;k of grinding corn, though they were offered half of it in pay|ment. Six men only died in the cour&s;e of this winter.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of 1606, Dupont attempted to find what De Monts had mi&s;&s;ed, in the preceding year, a more &s;outherly &s;ettlement. His bark was twice forced back with adver&s;e winds; and the third time was driven on rocks and bilged at the mouth of the port. The men and &s;tores were &s;aved; but the ve&s;|&s;el was lo&s;t. The&s;e fruitle&s;s attempts proved very di&s;couraging; but Dupont employed his people, in building a bark and &s;hallop; that they might employ them&s;elves in vi&s;iting the ports, whither their countrymen re&s;ort to dry their fi&s;h, till new &s;upplies &s;hould arrive.</P>
<P>De Monts and Poutrincourt were at that time in France, preparing, amid&s;t every di&s;|couragement, for another voyage. On the thir|teenth of May, they &s;ailed from Rochelle, in a &s;hip of one hundred and fifty tons; and on the 27th of July arrived at Port Royal, in the ab&s;ence of Dupont, who had left two men only to guard the fort. In a few days
<PB N="332" REF="026637_0330_0FD105A40A1A8C40">
he arrived, having met with one of their boats which they had left at Can&s;eau, and great was the joy on both &s;ides at their meeting.</P>
<P>Poutrincourt now began his plantation; and having cleared a &s;pot of ground, within fifteen days he &s;owed European corn and &s;ev|eral &s;orts of garden vegetables. But notwith|&s;tanding all the beauty and fertility of Port Royal, De Monts had &s;till a de&s;ire to find a better place at the &s;outhward. He therefore prevailed on Poutrincourt to make an|other voyage to Cape Malebarre; and &s;o earn|e&s;t was he to have this matter accompli&s;hed, that he would not wait till the next &s;pring, but prepared a bark to go to the the &s;outh|ward as &s;oon as the &s;hip was ready to &s;ail.</P>
<P>On the 28th of Augu&s;t, the &s;hip and the bark both &s;ailed from Port Royal. In the &s;hip De Monts and Dupont returned to France; whil&s;t Poutrincourt, Champlain, Champdore and others cro&s;&s;ed the bay to St. Croix, and thence &s;ailed along the coa&s;t; touching at many harbours in their way till they arrived in &s;ight of the Cape, the object of their voyage. Being entangled among the &s;hoals, their rudder was broken and they were obliged to come to anchor, at the di&s;tance of
<PB N="333" REF="026637_0331_0FD105A50D36F328">
three leagues from the land. The boat was then &s;ent a&s;hore to find a harbour of fre&s;h water; which by the information of one of the natives was accompli&s;hed. Fifteen days were &s;pent in this place; during which time, a cro&s;s was erected, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion taken, for the King of France; as De Monts had done two years before at Kenebeck. When the bark was repaired and ready to &s;ail, Poutrin|court took a walk into the country, whil&s;t his people were baking bread. In his ab&s;ence &s;ome of the natives vi&s;ited his people and &s;tole a hatchet. Two guns were fired at them, and they fled. In his return he &s;aw &s;everal parties of the &s;avages, male and female, carry|ing away their children and their corn; and hiding them&s;elves, as he and his com|pany pa&s;&s;ed. He was alarmed at this &s;trange appearance; but much more &s;o, when early the next morning a &s;hower of ar|rows came flying among his people, two of whom were killed and &s;everal others wounded. The &s;avages having taken their revenge, fled; and it was in vain to pur&s;ue them. The dead were buried at the foot of the cro&s;s; and whil&s;t the funeral &s;ervice was performing, the &s;avages were dancing and yelling in mock
<PB N="334" REF="026637_0332_0FD105A68DCF5EB0">
concert, at a convenient di&s;tance, but within hearing. When the French retired on board their bark, the &s;avages took down the cro&s;s, dug up the bodies and &s;tripped them of their grave clothes, which they carried off in tri|umph.</P>
<P>This unhappy quarrel gave Poutrincourt a bad idea of the natives. He attempted to pa&s;s farther round the cape; but was prevent|ed by contrary winds; and forced back to the &s;ame harbour, where the &s;avages offering to trade, &s;ix or &s;even of them were &s;eized and put to death.</P>
<P>The next day another attempt was made to &s;ail farther; but the wind came again&s;t them. At the di&s;tance of &s;ix or &s;even leagues they di&s;covered an i&s;land; but the wind would not permit them to approach it; they therefore gave it the name of Douteu&s;e, or Doubtful. This was probably either Nantucket or Ca|pawock, now called Martha's Vineyard; and if &s;o, the conte&s;t with the Indians was on the &s;outh &s;hore of Cape Cod; where are &s;everal harbours and &s;treams of fre&s;h water. To the harbour where he lay, he gave the name of Port Fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="026637_0333_0FD105A982EB8B18">It was now late in the &s;ea&s;on and no pro&s;|pect appeared of obtaining any better place for a &s;ettlement; be&s;ides, he had two wound|ed men who&s;e lives were in danger. He therefore determined to return, which he did by the &s;horte&s;t and mo&s;t direct cour&s;e; and after a perilous voyage, in which the rudder was again broken, and the bark narrowly e&s;|caped &s;hipwreck, he arrived at Port Royal on the 14th of November.</P>
<P>The manner in which they &s;pent the third winter was &s;ocial and fe&s;tive. At the princi|pal table, to which fifteen per&s;ons belonged, an order was e&s;tabli&s;hed, by the name of <HI>L'ordre de bon temps.</HI> Every one took his turn to be caterer and &s;teward, for one day, during which he wore the collar of the order and a napkin, and carried a &s;taff. After &s;upper he re&s;igned his accoutrements, with the ceremony of drinking a cup of wine, to the next in &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion. The advantage of this in&s;titution was, that each one was emulous to be prepared for his day; by previou&s;ly hunting or fi&s;hing, or purcha&s;ing fi&s;h and game of the natives, who con&s;tantly re&s;ided among them, and were ex|tremely plea&s;ed with their manners.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="026637_0334_0FD105ADABDABEE0">Four only died in this winter; and it is re|marked that the&s;e were "&s;luggi&s;h and fretful." The winter was mild and fair. On a Sunday in the middle of January, after divine &s;ervice, they "&s;ported and had mu&s;ic on the river;" and in the &s;ame month they went two leagues, to &s;ee their corn field, and dined cheerfully in the &s;un&s;hine.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t opening of the &s;pring (1607) they began to prepare gardens; the produce of which was extremely grateful; as were al|&s;o the numberle&s;s fi&s;h which came into the river. They al&s;o erected a water mill, which not only &s;aved them much hard labour, at the hand mill; but gave them more time for fi&s;h|ing. The fi&s;h which they took were called herrings and pilchards; of which they pickled &s;everal hog&s;heads to be &s;ent home to France.</P>
<P>In April they began to build two barks, in which they might vi&s;it the ports, frequented by the fi&s;hermen, and learn &s;ome news from their mother country, as well as get &s;upplies for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Having no pitch to pay the &s;eams, they were obliged to cut pine trees and burn them in kilns, by which means they obtained a &s;ufficiency.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="026637_0335_0FD105AFF5132498">On A&s;cen&s;ion day, a ve&s;&s;el arrived from France, de&s;tined to bring &s;upplies; a large &s;hare of which, the crew had ungenerou&s;ly con&s;umed in their voyage. The letters brought by this ve&s;&s;el informed them that the company of Merchants, a&s;&s;ociated with De Monts, was dicouraged; and that their &s;hip was to be employed in the fi&s;hery at Can&s;eau. The rea&s;on of this proceeding was, that con|trary to the King's edict, the Hollanders had intruded them&s;elves into the fur trade, in the river of Canada; having been conducted by a treacherous Frenchman; in con&s;equence of which, the King had revoked the exclu&s;ive privilege which he had given to De Monts for ten years. The avarice of the&s;e Holland|ers was &s;o great, that they had opened the graves of the dead, and taken the beaver&s;kins in which the corp&s;es had been buried. This outrage was &s;o highly re&s;ented by the &s;avages at Can&s;eau, that they killed the per&s;on, who had &s;hown the places where the dead were laid. This news was extremely unwelcome, as it portended the de&s;truction of the colony.</P>
<P>Poutrincourt however was &s;o well plea&s;ed with his &s;ituation, that he determined to re|turn
<PB N="338" REF="026637_0336_0FD105B2552884E8">
to it, though none but his own family &s;hould accompany him. He was very de&s;ir|ous to &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of his attempt at agricul|ture, and therefore detained the ve&s;&s;el, as long as he could; and employed his bark in &s;mall voyages, about the bay, to trade for furs, and gather &s;pecimens of iron and copper to be tran&s;ported to France. When they were all ready to &s;ail, he tarried eleven days longer than the others, that he might carry home the fir&s;t fruits of his harve&s;t. Leaving the buildings, and part of the provi&s;ion with the &s;tanding corn, as a pre&s;ent to the friendly na|tives, he finally &s;ailed from Port Royal, on the 11th of Augu&s;t, and joined the other ve&s;|&s;els at Can&s;eau; from which place, they proceeded to France, where they arrived in the latter end of September.</P>
<P>Specimens of the wheat, rye, barley, and oats were &s;hown to the King; which, with other productions of the country, animal and mineral, were &s;o highly acceptable, that he re|newed and confirmed to De Monts the privi|lege of trading for beavers; that he might have it in his power to e&s;tabli&s;h a colony. In con&s;equence of which, the next &s;pring &s;ev|eral families were &s;ent to renew the plantation,

who found that the &s;avages had gathered &s;ev|en barrels of the corn which had been left &s;tanding; and had re&s;erved one for their friends whom they expected to return.</P>
<P>The revocation of the exclu&s;ive patent given to De Monts, was founded on com|plaints, made by the ma&s;ters of fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els, that the branch of commerce in which they were engaged would be ruined. When this patent was re&s;tored, it was limited to one year; and on this condition, that he &s;hould make an e&s;tabli&s;hment in the river St. Law|rence. De Monts therefore quitted his connexion with Acadia, and the compa|ny of Merchants, with whom he had been connected, fitted out two &s;hips for the port of Tadou&s;ac, in 1608. The fur trade was of very con&s;iderable value, and the com|pany made great profits; but De Monts find|ing their intere&s;ts hurt by his connexion with them, withdrew from the a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>Poutrincourt re&s;olving to pro&s;ecute his plantation at Port Royal, the grant of which had been confirmed, to him by the King, &s;ent Biencourt, his &s;on, to France, (1608) for a &s;upply of men and provi&s;ions. One condition of the grant was, that attempts &s;hould be made
<PB N="340" REF="026637_0338_0FD105B75D9C0C30">
convert the natives to the Catholic faith, it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to engage the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tics. The fir&s;t who embrac|ed the propo&s;al were the Je&s;uits, by who&s;e zealous exertions a contribution was &s;oon made for the purpo&s;e; and two of their order, Biard and Ma&s;&s;e, embarked for the new plantation. It was not long before a controver&s;y aro&s;e be|tween them and the proprietor, who &s;aid "it was his part to <HI>rule</HI> them them on earth, and theirs only to <HI>guide</HI> him to heaven."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas v. 1808.</NOTE> After his departure for France, his &s;on Biencourt, di&s;daining to be controled by tho&s;e whom he had invited to re&s;ide with him, threatened them with corporal puni&s;hment, in return for their &s;piritual anathemas. It became nece&s;|&s;ary then that they &s;hould &s;eparate. The Je|&s;uits removed to mount De&s;art, where they planted gardens and entered on the bu&s;ine&s;s of their mi&s;&s;ion, which they continued till 1613 or 1614; when Sir Samuel Argal from Vir|ginia broke up the French &s;ettlements in Acadia. In the encounter one of the&s;e Je&s;uits was killed and the other was made pri&s;oner. Of the other Frenchmen, &s;ome di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves in the woods and mixed with the

&s;avages; &s;ome went to the river St. Law|rence and &s;trengthened the &s;ettlement which Champlain had made there; and others re|turned to France.</P>
<P>Two advantages were expected to re&s;ult from e&s;tabli&s;hing a colony in the river St. Lawrence: One was, an exten&s;ion of the fur trade, and another was the hope of penetrating we&s;tward, though the lakes, to the Pacific Ocean, and finding a nearer communication with China. One of the ve&s;&s;els &s;ent by the company of merchants, in 1608, to that river, was commanded by Champlain. In his form|er voyage he had marked the &s;trait above the I&s;le of Orleans, as a proper &s;ituation for a fort; becau&s;e the river was there contracted in its breadth, and the northern &s;hore was high and commanding. He arrived there in the begin|ning of July, and immediately began to clear the woods, to build hou&s;es, and prepare fields and gardens. Here he &s;pent the winter, and his company &s;uffered much by the &s;curvy. The remedy which Cartier had u&s;ed, was not to be found, or the &s;avages knew nothing of it. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that the former inhabitants had been extirpated, and a new people held po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas v, 1642.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="026637_0340_0FD105BF09DFFC10">In the &s;pring of 1609, Champlain, with two other Frenchmen and a party of the natives, went up the river now called Sorel and enter|ed the lakes, which lie toward the &s;outh, and communicate with the country of the Iroquois. To the large&s;t of the&s;e lakes Champlain gave his own name, which it has ever &s;ince retain|ed. On the &s;hore of another, which he called Lake Sacrament, now Lake George, they were di&s;covered by a company of the Iroquois, with whom they had a &s;kirmi&s;h. Champlain killed two of them with his mu&s;quet. The &s;calps of fifty were taken and brought to Quebeck in triumph.</P>
<P>In the autumn, Champlain went to France, leaving Capt Pierre to command; and in 1610 he returned to Quebeck, to perfect the colony, of which he may con&s;idered as the founder.</P>
<P>After the death of Henry IV, he ob|tained of the Queen Regent, a commi&s;|&s;ion as Lieutenant of New-France, with very exten&s;ive powers. This commi&s;&s;ion was confirmed by Lewis XIII; and Champlain was continued in the Government of Canada.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="026637_0341_0FD105C3A65147C8">The religious controver&s;ies, which prevail|ed in France, augmented the number of colo|ni&s;ts. A &s;ettlement was made at Trois Rivieres, and a bri&s;k trade was carried on at Tadou&s;ac. In 1626, Quebeck began to a&s;&s;ume the face of a city, and the fortre&s;s was rebuilt with &s;tone; but the people were divided in their religious principles and the Hugonot party prevailed.</P>
<P>In this divided &s;tate, (1629) the colony was attacked by an armament from England under the conduct of Sir David Kirk. He &s;ailed up the river St. Lawrence and appeared before Quebeck, which was then &s;o mi&s;erably &s;upplied, that they had but &s;even ounces of bread to a man for a day. A &s;quadron from France, with provi&s;ion for their relief, entered the river; but, after &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, were tak|en by the Engli&s;h. This di&s;appointment in|crea&s;ed the di&s;tre&s;s of the colony and obliged Champlain to capitulate. He was carried to France in an Engli&s;h &s;hip; and there found the minds of the people divided, with regard to Canada; &s;ome thinking it not worth regain|ing, as it had co&s;t the government va&s;t &s;ums, without bringing any return; others deeming

the fi&s;hery and fur trade to be great national objects, e&s;pecially as they proved to be a nur|&s;ery for &s;eamen. The&s;e &s;entiments, &s;upported by the &s;olicitation of Champlain, prevailed; and by the treaty of St. Germain's, in 1632, Canada, Acadia and Cape Breton were re&s;tor|ed to France.</P>
<P>The next year Champlain re&s;umed his gov|ernment, and the company of New France were re&s;tored to their former rights and pri|vileges. A large recruit of inhabitants, with a competent &s;upply of Je&s;uits, arrived from France; and with &s;ome difficulty a mi&s;&s;ion was e&s;tabli&s;hed among the Hurons; and a &s;em|inary of the order was begun at Quebeck. In the mid&s;t of this pro&s;perity Champlain died, in the month of December, 1635; and was &s;ucceeded the next year by De Montmagny.</P>
<P>Champlain is characterized as a man of good &s;en&s;e, &s;trong penetration and upright views; volatile, active, enterprizing, firm and valiant. He aided the Hurons in their wars with the Iroquois, and per&s;onally engaged in their battles; in one of which he was wound|ed.

in the navy of their mi&s;tre&s;s. When the peace, which her &s;ucce&s;&s;or, James I, made in 1604, put an end to their hopes of honor and fortune by military enterprizes, Sir Ferdinando was appointed Governor of Plymouth, in Devon&s;hire. This circum|&s;tance, by which the &s;pirit of adventure might &s;eem to have been repre&s;&s;ed, proved the occa|&s;ion of its breaking out with fre&s;h ardour, though in a pacific and mercantile form, con|nected with the rage for foreign di&s;coveries, which after &s;ome interruption, had again &s;eiz|ed the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>Lord Arundel, of Wardour, had employed a Captain Weymouth in &s;earch of a north|we&s;t pa&s;&s;age to India. This navigator having mi&s;taken his cour&s;e, fell in with a river on the coa&s;t of America, which, by his de&s;cription, mu&s;t have been either Kenebeck, or Penob|&s;cot. From thence he brought to England, five of the natives, and arrived in the month of July, 1605, in the harbour of Plymouth, where Gorges commanded, who immediately took three of them into his family. Their names were Manida, Sketwarroes and Ta&s;|quantum; they were all of one language, though not of the &s;ame tribe. This accident
<PB N="348" REF="026637_0346_0FD105CE13810AC0">
proved the occa&s;ion, under God's providence, of preparing the way for a more perfect di&s;|covery than had yet been made of this part of North-America.</P>
<P>Having gained the affections of the&s;e &s;ava|ges by kind treatment, he found them very docile and intelligent; and from them he learned by inquiry, many particulars concern|ing their country, its rivers, harbours, i&s;lands, fi&s;h and other animals; the numbers, di&s;po|&s;ition, manners and cu&s;toms of the natives; their government, alliances, enemies, force and methods of war. The re&s;ult of the&s;e in|quiries &s;erved to feed a &s;anguine hope of in|dulging his genius and advancing his for|tune by a more thorough di&s;covery of the country.</P>
<P>His chief a&s;&s;ociate in this plan of di&s;covery, was Sir John Popham, Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the King's Bench, who, by his acquaintance with divers noblemen, and by their intere&s;t at court, obtained from King James a patent for making &s;ettlements in America, which was now divided into two di&s;tricts, and called North and South Virginia. The latter of the&s;e di&s;tricts was put under the care of cer|tain noblemen, knights, and gentlemen, who
<PB N="349" REF="026637_0347_0FD105D0256666E0">
were &s;tyled the London Company; the former under the direction of others in Bri&s;tol, Exe|ter and Plymouth, who were called the Ply|mouth Company, becau&s;e their meetings were u&s;ually held there.</P>
<P>By the joint efforts of this company, of which Popham and Gorges were two of the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing members; a &s;hip, command|ed by Henry Chalong, was fitted out, and &s;ailed in Augu&s;t, 1606, for the di&s;covery of the country, from which the &s;avages had been brought, and two of them were put on board. The orders given to the ma&s;ter, were to keep in as high a latitude as Cape Breton, till he &s;hould di&s;cover the main land, and then to range the coa&s;t &s;outhward, till he &s;hould find the place from which the natives had been taken. In&s;tead of ob&s;erving the&s;e orders, the Captain falling &s;ick on the pa&s;&s;age, made a &s;outhern cour&s;e, and fir&s;t arrived at the i&s;land of Porto Rico, where he tarried &s;ome time for the recovery of his health; from thence coming northwardly, he fell in with a Span|i&s;h fleet from the Havannah, by whom the &s;hip was &s;eized and carried to Spain.</P>

<P>It was determined to &s;end over a large num|ber of people &s;ufficient to begin a colony. For this purpo&s;e George Popham was appointed pre&s;ident; Raleigh Gilbert, admiral; Ed|ward Harlon, ma&s;ter of ordnance; Robert Davis, &s;erjeant major; Elis Be&s;t, mar&s;hal; Mr. Seaman, &s;ecretary; James Davis, com|mander of the fort; Gome Carew, &s;earcher.

They &s;ailed from Plymouth in two &s;hips (May 31, 1607) and having fallen in with the i&s;land of Monahigon (Augu&s;t 11,) landed at the mouth of Sagada|hock, or Kenebeck river, on a penin&s;ula, where they erected a &s;tore hou&s;e, and having fortified it as well as their circum&s;tances would admit, gave it the name of Fort St. George.</P>

<P>The Pre&s;ident having received &s;everal invi|tations, was preparing to comply with their reque&s;t, and had advanced &s;ome leagues on his way, but contrary winds, and bad weather, obliged him to return, to the great grief of the &s;achems, who were to have attended him.

advanced before their arrival to begin planting for that year, if there had been ground prepar|ed for tillage. They had to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the provi&s;ions which they had brought from England, and the fi&s;h and game which the country afforded. The &s;everity of an Ame|rican winter was new to them; and though it was ob&s;erved, that the &s;ame winter was un|commonly &s;evere in England, yet that cir|cum&s;tance being unknown, could not allevi|ate their di&s;tre&s;s. By &s;ome accident, their &s;tore hou&s;e took fire, and was con&s;umed, with the greater part of their provi&s;ions, in the middle of the winter; and in the &s;pring (1608) they had the additional misfortune to lo&s;e their Pre&s;ident, Captain Popham, by death. The &s;hip, which their friends in England had by their united exertions &s;ent over with &s;upplies, arrived a few days after, with the melancholy news of the death of Sir John Popham, which happened while &s;he lay waiting for a wind at Plymouth. The command of the colony now devolved on Gilbert, but the next &s;hip brought an ac|count of the death of his brother Sir John Gilbert, which obliged him to return to Eng|land, to take care of the e&s;tate to which he
<PB N="353" REF="026637_0351_0FD105D718E87ED0">
&s;ucceeded. The&s;e repeated misfortunes and di&s;appointments, operating with the di&s;gu&s;t which the new coloni&s;ts had taken to the climate and &s;oil, determined them to quit the place. Accordingly, having embarked with their Pre&s;ident, they returned to England, carrying with them, as the fruit of their la|bour, a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, which they had built during their re&s;idence here, and thus the fir&s;t colony, which was attempted in New Eng|land, began and ended in one year.</P>
<P>The country was now branded as intolera|bly cold, and the body of the adventurers re|linqui&s;hed the de&s;ign. Sir Francis Popham, indeed, employed a &s;hip for &s;ome &s;ucceeding years in the fi&s;hing and fur trade; but he, at length, became content with his lo&s;&s;es, and none of this company but Sir Ferdinando Gorges, had the re&s;olution to &s;urmount all di&s;couragements. Though he &s;incerely lament|ed the lo&s;s of his worthy friend, the Chief Ju&s;|tice, who had zealou&s;ly joined with him, in the&s;e hitherto fruitle&s;s, but expen&s;ive labours, yet, "as to the coldne&s;s of the clime (he &s;ays) he had too much experience in the world, to be frighted with &s;uch a bla&s;t, as knowing many great kingdoms and large territories

<P>Such per&s;evering ardor in the face of &s;o ma|ny di&s;couragements, mu&s;t be allowed to di&s;|cover a mind formed for enterprize, and fully per&s;uaded of the practicability of the under|taking.</P>
<P>When he found that he could not be &s;ec|onded in his attempts for a thorough di&s;cov|ery of the country, by others, he determined to carry it on by him&s;elf; and for this pur|po&s;e he purcha&s;ed a &s;hip, and engaged with a ma&s;ter and crew to go to the coa&s;t of New England for the purpo&s;e of fi&s;hing and traffic, the only inducement which &s;eafaring people could have to undertake &s;uch a voyage. On board this &s;hip he put RICHARD VINES, and &s;everal others of his own &s;ervants in whom he placed the fulle&s;t confidence and whom he hired at a great expen&s;e to &s;tay in the country, over the winter, and pur&s;ue the di&s;covery of it. The&s;e per&s;ons having left the &s;hip's com|pany to follow their u&s;ual occupation on the coa&s;t, travelled into the land, and meeting

with the &s;avages, who had before returned to America, by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance became acquainted with &s;uch particulars as Gorges wi&s;hed to know.</P>
<P>Mr. Vines and his companions were received by the Indians with great ho&s;pitality, though their re&s;idence among them was rendered haz|ardous; both by a war which raged among them, and by a pe&s;tilence which accompanied or &s;ucceeded it.</P>
<P>This war and pe&s;tilence are frequently &s;poken of by the hi&s;torians of New England, as remarkable events, in the cour&s;e of Provi|dence, which prepared the way for the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of an European colony. Concern|ing the war, we know nothing more than this; that it was begun by the Tarratenes, a nation who re&s;ided ea&s;tward of Penob&s;cot. The&s;e formidable people &s;urprized the Ba&s;ha|ba, or chief &s;achem, at his head quarters, and de&s;troyed him with all his family; upon which all the other &s;achems who were &s;ubor|dinate to him, quarrelled among them&s;elves for the &s;overeignty: and in the&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions many of them as well as of their unhappy people peri&s;hed.

The extent of this pe&s;tilence was between Penob&s;cot in the ea&s;t, and Narragan&s;et in the we&s;t. The&s;e two tribes e&s;caped, whil&s;t the intermediate peo|ple were wa&s;ted and de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The information which Vines obtained for Sir Ferdinando, though &s;atisfactory, in one view, produced no real advantage proportion|ate to the expen&s;e. Whil&s;t he was deliberat|ing by what means he &s;hould farther pro&s;e|cute his plan of colonization, Capt. Henry Harley, who had been one of the unfortunate adventurers to Sagadahock, came to him,
<PB N="357" REF="026637_0355_0FD105E02FFA3618">
bringing a native of the I&s;land Capawock, now called Martha's Vineyard, who had been treacherou&s;ly taken from his own country by one of the fi&s;hing &s;hips and &s;hown in London as a &s;ight. Gorges received this &s;avage, who&s;e name was Epenow, with great plea|&s;ure: and about the &s;ame time recovered A&s;|&s;acumet, one of tho&s;e who had been &s;ent in the unfortunate voyage of Captain Chalong. The&s;e two Indians at fir&s;t, &s;carcely under&s;tood each other; but, when they had grown better acquainted, A&s;&s;acumet informed his old ma&s;ter of what he had learned from Epenow con|cerning his country. This artful fellow had invented a &s;tory of a <HI>mine of gold</HI> in his native i&s;land which he &s;uppo&s;ed would induce &s;ome adventurer to employ him as a pilot, by which means he hoped to get home, and he was not di&s;appointed in his expectation.</P>
<P>Gorges had engaged the Earl of Southamp|ton, then commander of the I&s;le of Wight, to advance one hundred pounds, and Capt. Hob&s;on another hundred, and al&s;o to go on the di&s;covery. With this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, Harley &s;ailed in June 1614, carrying with him &s;everal land &s;oldiers and the two before mentioned Indians, with a third named Wanap&eacute;, who
<PB N="358" REF="026637_0356_0FD105E2D6324810">
had been &s;ent to Gorges from the I&s;le of Wight. On the arrival of the &s;hip, &s;he was &s;oon piloted to the i&s;land of Capawock, and to the harbour where Epenow was to perform his promi&s;e. The principal inhabitants of the place, with &s;ome of his own kin&s;men, came on board, with whom he held a conference and contrived his e&s;cape. They departed, promi&s;ing to return the next day with furs for traffick. Epenow had pretended that if it were known, that he had di&s;covered the &s;e|crets of his country, his life would be in danger, but the company were careful to watch him; and to prevent his e&s;cape, had dre&s;&s;ed him in long clothes, which could ea&s;i|ly be laid hold of, if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion. His friends appeared the next morning in twenty canoes, and lying at a di&s;tance, the Captain called to them to come on board, which they declining, Epenow was ordered to renew the invitation. He, mounting the foreca&s;tle, hailed them as he was directed, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant, though one held him by the coat, yet being &s;trong and heavy, he jump|ed into the water. His countrymen then ad|vanced to receive him, and &s;ent a &s;hower of arrows into the &s;hip, which &s;o di&s;concerted

<P>The Plymouth company were much di&s;|couraged by the ill &s;ucce&s;s of this adventure; but the &s;pirit of emulation between them and the London company proved very &s;erviceable to the cau&s;e in which they were jointly en|gaged. For the&s;e having &s;ent our four &s;hips under the command of Michael Cooper, to South Virginia, [January, 1615] and Captain John Smith, who had been employed by that company, having returned to England, and engaged with the company at Plymouth, their hopes revived. Sir Ferdinando Gorges, in concert with Dr. Sutliffe, Dean of Exeter, and &s;everal others, equipped two ve&s;&s;els, one of two hundred, the other of 50 tons, on board of which (be&s;ides the compliment of &s;eamen) were &s;ixteen men who were de&s;tined to begin a colony in New England. [March, 1615] When they had &s;ailed one hundred and twen|ty leagues, the large &s;hip lo&s;t her ma&s;ts, and &s;prung a leak; which obliged them to put back under jury ma&s;ts to Plymouth. From
<PB N="360" REF="026637_0358_0FD105E84B4D2870">
thence Smith &s;ailed again [June 24] in a bark of &s;ixty tons, carrying the &s;ame &s;ixteen men; but on this &s;econd voyage, was taken by four French men of war, and carried to France. The ve&s;&s;el of fifty tons, which had been &s;eparated from him, pur&s;ued her voyage, and returned in &s;afety; but the main de&s;ign of the voyage, which was to effect a &s;ettlement, was fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year (October) Sir Richard Haw|kins, by authority of the Plymouth company, of which he was Pre&s;ident for that year, vi&s;it|ed the coa&s;t of New England, to try what &s;ervices he could do them in &s;earching the country, and its commodities; but on his ar|rival, finding the natives engaged in war, he pa&s;&s;ed along the coa&s;t to Virginia, and from thence returned to England, by the way of Spain, where he di&s;po&s;ed of the fi&s;h, which he had taken in the voyage.</P>
<P>After this, &s;hips were &s;ent every &s;ea&s;on by the London and Plymouth Companies on voyages of profit; their fi&s;h and furs came to a good market in Europe, but all the attempts which were made to colonize North Virginia, by &s;ome unfore&s;een accidents failed of &s;ucce&s;s. Gorges, however, had his mind &s;till invariably
<PB N="361" REF="026637_0359_0FD105ED23BFCF48">
bent on his original plan, and every incident which &s;eemed to favour his views, was eager|ly improved for that purpo&s;e. Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of the journals and letters of the &s;everal voyagers, and of all the information which could be had, and being always at hand, to attend the meetings of the Company, he con|trived to keep alive their hopes, and was the prime mover in all their tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>About this time Captain Thomas Dermer, who had been employed in the American fi&s;hery, and had entered fully into the &s;ame views; offered his &s;ervice to a&s;&s;i&s;t in pro&s;ecut|ing the di&s;covery of the country. He was at Newfoundland, and Gorges prevailed on the company, to &s;end Captain Edward Ro|craft, in a &s;hip, to New England, with ord|ers to wait there till he &s;hould be joined by Dermer. Rocraft, on his arrival, met with a French interloper, which he &s;eized, and then &s;ailed with his prize to South Virginia. In the mean time Dermer went to England, and having conferred with Gorges and the com|pany, on the intended di&s;covery, went out in a &s;hip, which Gorges him&s;elf owned; hoping to meet with Rocraft, but was much perplex|ed at not finding him.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="026637_0360_0FD105F0B39BC2F0">Having ranged and examined every part of the coa&s;t, and made many u&s;eful ob&s;ervations, which he tran&s;mitted to Gorges, he &s;haped his cour&s;e for Virginia,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid that he was the fir&s;t who pa&s;&s;ed the whole extent of Long I&s;land Sound, and di&s;covered that it was not connected with the continent. This was in 1619.</NOTE> where Rocraft had been killed in a quarrel, and his bark &s;unk. Dermer being thus di&s;appointed of his con|&s;ort, and of his expected &s;upplies, returned to the northward. At the i&s;land of Capawock, he met with Epenow, who knowing him to be employed by Gorges, and &s;u&s;pecting that his errand was to bring him back to England, con&s;pired with his countrymen, to &s;eize him and his companions, &s;everal of whom were killed in the fray: Dermer de|fended him&s;elf with his &s;word, and e&s;caped, though not without fourteen wounds, which obliged him to go again to Virginia, where he died. The lo&s;s of this worthy man, was the mo&s;t di&s;couraging circum&s;tance which Gorges had met with, and as he him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, "made him almo&s;t re&s;olve never to intermed|dle again in any of the&s;e cour&s;es." But he had in fact &s;o deeply engaged in them, and had &s;o many per&s;ons engaged with him, that he could not retreat with honour, whil&s;t any
<PB N="363" REF="026637_0361_0FD105F3A4345F20">
hope of &s;ucce&s;s remained. Soon after this, a pro&s;pect began to open from a quarter, where it was lea&s;t expected.</P>
<P>The patent of 1606, which divided Virgin|ia into two colonies, expre&s;sly provided that neither company &s;hould begin any plantation within one hundred miles of the other. By this interdiction the middle region of North America was neglected, and a bait was laid to attract the attention of foreigners.</P>
<P>The adventurers to South Virginia had pro|hibited all who were not free of their compa|ny from planting or trading within their lim|its; the northern company had made no &s;uch regulation; by this means it happened that the South Virginia &s;hips could fi&s;h on the northern coa&s;t, whil&s;t the other company were excluded from all privileges in the &s;outh|ern parts. The South Virginians had al&s;o made other regulations in the management of their bu&s;ine&s;s, which the northern company were de&s;irous to intimate. They thought the mo&s;t effectual way to do this, was to procure an exclu&s;ive patent. With this view, Gorges, ever active to promote the intere&s;t which he had e&s;pou&s;ed, &s;olicited of the crown a new charter, which, by the intere&s;t of his friends in
<PB N="364" REF="026637_0362_0FD105F64D0B2450">
court, was after &s;ome delay obtained. By this in&s;trument forty noblemen, knights and gentlemen, were incorporated by the &s;tyle of "the council e&s;tabli&s;hed at Plymouth, in the county of Devon, for the planting, ruling and governing of New England in America." The date of the charter was November 3, 1620. The territory &s;ubject to their juri&s;diction was from the 40th to the 48th degree of north latitude, and from &s;ea to &s;ea. This charter is the foundation of all the grants which were made of the country of New England.</P>
<P>Before this divi&s;ion was made, a number of families, who were &s;tyled <HI>Puritans,</HI> on ac|count of their &s;eeking a farther reformation of the Church of England, which they could not obtain, and who had retired into Holland to avoid the &s;everity of the penal laws again&s;t di&s;&s;enters, meditated a removal to America. The Dutch were fond of retaining them as their &s;ubjects, and made them large offers, if they would &s;ettle in &s;ome of their tran&s;marine territories; but they cho&s;e rather to re&s;ide in the dominions of their native prince, if they could have liberty of con&s;cience. They had, by their agents, negociated with the South Virginia company, and obtained a permi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="365" REF="026637_0363_0FD105F905FCAF30">
to tran&s;port them&s;elves to America within their limits; but as to the liberty of con|&s;cience, though they could obtain no indul|gence from the crown under hand and &s;eal, yet it was declared, that "the King would connive at them, provided they behaved peaceably." As this was all the favour which the &s;pirit of the times would allow, they de|termined to ca&s;t them&s;elves on the care of Divine Providence and venture to America. After &s;everal di&s;a&s;ters, they arrived at Cape Cod in the 42d degree of north latitude, a place remote from the object of their intention, which was Hud&s;on's river. The Dutch had their eye on that place and bribed their pilot not to carry them thither. It was late in the &s;ea&s;on when they arrived; their permi&s;&s;ion from the Virginia company was of no u&s;e here; and having neither authority nor form of government, they were obliged for the &s;ake of order, before they di&s;embarked, to form them&s;elves into a body politic, by a written in&s;trument. This was the beginning of the colony of New-Plymouth; and this event happened (Nov. 11, 1620) a few days after King James had &s;igned the patent for incor|porating the council, The&s;e circum&s;tances
<PB N="366" REF="026637_0364_0FD105FB72D09738">
&s;erved the intere&s;t of both, though then wholly unknown to each other. The coun|cil, being informed of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a colony within their limits, were fond of tak|ing them into their protection, and the colony were equally de&s;irous of receiving that pro|tection as far as to obtain a grant of territory. An agent being di&s;patched by the colony to England, Sir F. Gorges intere&s;ted him&s;elf in the affair, and a grant was accordingly made (1623) to John Peirce, in tru&s;t for the colony. This was their fir&s;t patent; they afterwards (1629) had another made to William Bradford and his a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>One end which the council had in view, was, to prevent the acce&s;s of unauthorized ad|venturers to the coa&s;t of New-England. The crews of their &s;hips, in their intercour&s;e with the natives, being far from any e&s;tabli&s;hed government, were guilty of great licentiou&s;|ne&s;s. Be&s;ides drunkenne&s;s, and debauchery, &s;ome flagrant enormities had been committed, which not only injured the reputation of Eu|ropeans, but encouraged the natives to acts of ho&s;tility. To remedy the&s;e evils, the coun|cil thought proper to appoint an officer to ex|erci&s;e government on the coa&s;t. The fir&s;t
<PB N="367" REF="026637_0365_0FD105FDC0837070">
per&s;on who was &s;ent in this character, was Capt. Francis We&s;t; who finding the fi&s;her|men too licentious and robu&s;t to be control|ed by him, &s;oon gave up this ineffectual com|mand. They next appointed Capt. Robert Gorges, a &s;on of Sir Ferdinando. He was like his father, of an active and enterprizing genius, and had newly returned from the Ve|netian war. He obtained of the council a patent for a tract of land on the northea&s;tern &s;ide of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, containing thirty miles in length and ten in breadth, and by the influence of his father, and of his kin&s;man Lord Edward Gorges, he was di&s;patched with a commi&s;&s;ion to be "<HI>Lieutenant General and Governour of New England.</HI>" They appointed for his council the afore&s;aid We&s;t, with Chri&s;|topher Levet, and the Governour of New Ply|mouth for the time being. Gorges came to Plymouth in 1623, publi&s;hed his commi&s;&s;ion, and made &s;ome efforts to execute it. He brought over with him as a Chaplain, Willi|am Morrell, an Epi&s;copal clergyman. This was the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a <HI>General Government</HI> in New England, and Morrel was to have a &s;uperintendence in ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical, as Gorges had in civil affairs; but
<PB N="368" REF="026637_0366_0FD106005EE0F3F8">
he made no u&s;e of his commi&s;&s;ion at Ply|mouth; and only mentioned it in his conver|&s;ation about the time of his departure.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This Morrell appears to have been a diligent inquirer into the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of the country, its natural productions and advantages, the manners, cu&s;toms, and government of the natives; the re&s;ult of his ob&s;ervations he wrought into a poem which he printed both in Latin and Engli&s;h. The Latin is by no means de&s;titute of cla&s;&s;ical merit, of which the following lines may &s;erve as an evidence.</P>
<Q><L>"E&s;t locus occiduo procul hinc &s;patio&s;us in orbe</L>

<P>The de&s;cription it&s;elf is ju&s;t and animated, and the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation (con&s;idering the date of it) is very tolerable.

<PB N="369" REF="026637_0367_0FD1060259278788">
&s;upplies which he expected to have received having failed. This failure was owing to one of tho&s;e cro&s;s accidents which continually be|fel the Council of Plymouth. Though the erection of this board was really beneficial to the nation, and gave a proper direction to the &s;pirit of colonizing, yet they had to &s;truggle with the oppo&s;ing intere&s;ts of various &s;orts of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The company of South Virginia, and in|deed the mercantile intere&s;t in general, find|ing them&s;elves excluded from the privilege of fi&s;hing and traffic, complained of this in&s;titu|tion as a monopoly. The commons of Eng|land were growing jealous of the royal pre|rogative; and wi&s;hing to re&s;train it; the grant|ing charters of incorporation with exclu&s;ive advantages of commerce was deemed a u&s;ur|pation on the rights of the people. Com|plaints were fir&s;t made to the King in coun|cil; but no di&s;po&s;ition appeared there to countenance them. It happened however, that a parliament was called for &s;ome other purpo|&s;es (February 1624) in which Sir Edward Cook was cho&s;en &s;peaker of the commons. He was well known as an advocate for the liberties of the people, and an enemy to pro|jectors.
<PB N="370" REF="026637_0368_0FD10604E9110BD8">
The King was at fir&s;t in a good hu|mour with his parliament and advantage was taken of a demand for &s;ub&s;idies to bring in a bill again&s;t monopolies.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e being re&s;olved into a committee, Sir Ferdinando Gorges was called to the bar, where the &s;peaker informed him, that the patent granted to the council of Plymouth was complained of as a grievance; that under colour of planting a colony, they were pur&s;u|ing private gains: that though they re&s;pect|ed him as a per&s;on of worth and honour, yet the public intere&s;t was to be regarded before all per&s;onal con&s;iderations; and therefore they re|quired that the patent be delivered to the hou&s;e. Gorges an&s;wered, that he was but one of the company, inferior in rank and abilities, to many others; that he had no power to de|liver it, without their con&s;ent, neither in fact, was it in his cu&s;tody. Being a&s;ked where it was, he &s;aid, it was for aught he knew, &s;till remaining in the crown-office, where it had been left for the amendment of &s;ome errors. As to the general charge he an&s;wered; that he knew not how it could be a public <HI>griev|ance</HI>; &s;ince it had been undertaken for the advancement of religion, the enlargement of
<PB N="371" REF="026637_0369_0FD10607ABFF1F60">
the bounds of the nation, the increa&s;e of trade, and the employment of many thou&s;ands of people; that it could not be a <HI>monopoly</HI>; for though a few only were intere&s;ted in the bu|&s;ine&s;s, it was becau&s;e many could not be in|duced to adventure where their lo&s;&s;es at fir&s;t were &s;ure, and their gains uncertain; and, indeed, &s;o much lo&s;s had been &s;u&s;tained that mo&s;t of the adventurers them&s;elves were weary; that as to the profit ari&s;ing from the fi&s;hery it was never intended to be con|verted to private u&s;e, as might appear by the offers which they had made to all the maritime cities in the We&s;t of England; that the grant of exclu&s;ive privileges made by the crown, was intended to regulate and &s;ettle plantations, by the profits ari&s;ing from the trade, and was in effect no more than many gentlemen and lords of manors in England enjoyed without offence. He added, that he was glad of an opportunity for &s;uch a parliamen|tary inquiry, and if they would take upon them&s;elves the bu&s;ine&s;s of colonization, he and his a&s;&s;ociates would be their humble &s;er|vants as far as lay in their power, without any retro&s;pect to the va&s;t expen&s;e which they had already incurred in di&s;covering and taking po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="372" REF="026637_0370_0FD10609750593F0">
of the country, and bringing matters to their then pre&s;ent &s;ituation. He al&s;o de&s;ired, that if any thing further was to be inquired into, it might be given him in detail; with liberty of an&s;wering by his council.</P>
<P>A committee was appointed to examine the patent and make objections; which were deli|vered to Gorges; accompanied with a decla|ration from the &s;peaker that he ought to look upon this as a favour. Gorges having acknow|ledged the favour, employed council to draw up an&s;wers to the objections. His council were Mr. (afterwards Lord) Finch, and Mr. Caltrup, afterwards attorney general to the court of wards. Though in cau&s;es where the crown and parliament are concerned as parties, council are often afraid of wading deeper than they can &s;afely return; yet Gorges was &s;atisfied with the conduct of his council, who fully an&s;wered the objections, both in point of <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI>; the&s;e an&s;wers being read, the hou&s;e a&s;ked what further he had to &s;ay, upon which he added &s;ome ob&s;ervations in point of <HI>Policy,</HI> to the following effect:</P>
<P>That the adventurers had been at great co&s;t and pains to enlarge the King's dominions; to employ many &s;eamen, handicraftsmen, and
<PB N="373" REF="026637_0371_0FD1060BECE5A700">
labourers; to &s;ettle a flouri&s;hing plantation, and advance religion in tho&s;e &s;avage countries; matters of the highe&s;t con&s;equence to the nation, and far exceeding all the advantage which could be expected from a &s;imple cour&s;e of fi&s;hing, which mu&s;t &s;oon have been given over; for that &s;o valuable a country, could not long remain unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed either by the French, Spaniards, or Dutch; &s;o that if the plantations were to be given up, the fi&s;hery mu&s;t inevitably be lo&s;t, and the honour, as well as intere&s;t of the nation, greatly &s;uffer; that the mi&s;chief already done by the per&s;ons who were foremo&s;t in their complaints was intolerable; for, in their di&s;orderly intercour&s;e with the &s;avages, they had been guilty of the greate&s;t exce&s;&s;es of debauchery and knavery, and in addition to all the&s;e immoralities, they had furni&s;hed them with arms and ammuni|tion; by which they were enabled to de&s;|troy the peaceable fi&s;hermen, and had become formidable enemies to the planters.</P>
<P>He further added, that he had, in zeal for the intere&s;t of his country, deeply engaged his own e&s;tate, and &s;ent one of his &s;ons to the American coa&s;t, be&s;ides encouraging many of his friends to go thither; this he hoped would
<PB N="374" REF="026637_0372_0FD1060D35E4B508">
be an apology for his earne&s;tne&s;s in this plea, as if he had &s;hewn le&s;s warmth it might have been con&s;trued into negligence and in|gratitude.</P>
<P>The&s;e pleas however earne&s;t and rational, were to no purpo&s;e. The parliament pre|&s;ented to the King the grievances of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the patent for New-England was the fir&s;t on the li&s;t. Gorges, however, had taken care that the King &s;hould be previou&s;ly acquainted with the objections and an&s;wers; and James was &s;o jealous of his prerogative, that though he gave his a&s;&s;ent to a declara|tory act again&s;t monopolies in general, yet he would not recal the patent. However, in deference to the voice of the nation, the coun|cil thought fit to &s;u&s;pend their operations. This proved for a while, di&s;couraging to the &s;pirit of adventure and occa&s;ioned the recalling Robert Gorges from his govern|ment.</P>
<P>But the parliament having proceeded with more freedom and boldne&s;s in their com|plaints, than &s;uited the feelings of James, he di&s;&s;olved them in ha&s;te, before they could proceed to mea&s;ures for remedying the di&s;or|ders in church and &s;tate, which had been the
<PB N="375" REF="026637_0373_0FD1060F8F4A3710">
&s;ubject of complaint; and &s;ome of the more liberal &s;peakers were committed to pri&s;on. This &s;erved to damp the &s;pirit of reformation, and prepared the way for another colony of emi|grants to New-England.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, the French amba&s;|&s;ador put in a claim in behalf of his court to the&s;e territories, to which Gorges was &s;ummoned to an&s;wer before the King and council, which he did in &s;o ample and con|vincing a manner, that the claim was for that time &s;ilenced. Gorges then, in the name of the Council of Plymouth, complained of the Dutch, as intruders on the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions in America, by making a &s;ettlement on Hud&s;on's river. To this, the States made an|&s;wer, that if any &s;uch things had been done, it was without their order, as they had only erected a company for the We&s;t Indies. This an&s;wer, made the council re&s;olve to pro&s;ecute their bu&s;ine&s;s and remove the&s;e intruders.</P>
<P>Hitherto Gorges appears in the light of a zealous, indefatigable and un&s;ucce&s;s|ful adventurer; but neither his labours, expen&s;e, nor ill &s;ucce&s;s were yet come to a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="026637_0374_0FD10611AFEF02E8">To entertain a ju&s;t view of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, we mu&s;t con&s;ider him both as a mem|ber of the Council of Plymouth, pur&s;uing the general intere&s;t of American plantations; and at the &s;ame time as an adventurer, undertak|ing a &s;ettlement of his own, in a particular part of the territory which was &s;ubject to the juri&s;diction of the council. Having formed an intimacy with Capt. John Ma&s;on, Governour of Port&s;mouth, in the county of Hants, who was al&s;o a member of the council; and hav|ing (1622) jointly with him procured from the council, a grant of a large extent of coun|try, which they called <HI>Laconia,</HI> extending from the river Merrimack to Sagadahock, and from the ocean to the lakes and river of Canada, they indulged &s;anguine expectation of &s;ucce&s;s. From the accounts given of the country by &s;ome romantic travellers, they had conceived an idea of it as a kind of terre&s;trial paradi&s;e, not merely <HI>capable</HI> of producing all the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life but as already richly furni&s;hed by the bountiful hand of nature. The air was &s;aid to be pure and &s;alubrious; the country plea&s;ant and delightful, full of goodly fore&s;ts, fair vallies, and fertile plains; abounding in vines, che&s;nuts, walnuts, and

Some years after, another &s;ettlement was made on the river of Agamenticus, by Francis Norton, whom Gorges &s;ent over with a num|ber of other people, having procured for them a patent of 12,000 acres on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, and 12,000 more on the we&s;t

Norton was a Lieu|tenant Colonel, and had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to that rank from a common &s;oldier, by his own merit. In this company were &s;everal artific|ers, who were employed in building &s;aw mills, and they were &s;upplied with cattle and other nece&s;&s;aries for the bu&s;ine&s;s of getting lumber.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time (viz. 1623) a &s;ettle|ment was begun at the river Pi&s;cataqua, by Captain Ma&s;on, and &s;everal other merchants, among whom Gorges had a &s;hare. The prin|cipal de&s;ign of the&s;e &s;ettlements was, to e&s;tab|li&s;h a permanent fi&s;hery, to make &s;alt, to trade with the natives, and to prepare lumber for exportation. Agriculture was but a &s;econdary object, though in it&s;elf the true &s;ource of all opulence and all &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>The&s;e attempts proved very expen&s;ive and yielded no adequate returns. The a&s;&s;ociates were di&s;couraged, and dropped off one after another, till none but Gorges and Ma&s;on re|mained. Much patience was nece&s;&s;ary, but in this ca&s;e it could be grounded only on en|thu&s;ia&s;m. It was not po&s;&s;ible in the nature of things that their intere&s;t &s;hould be advanc|ed

by the manner in which they conducted their bu&s;ine&s;s. Their coloni&s;ts came over either as tenants or as hired &s;ervants. The produce of the plantation could not pay their wages, and they &s;oon became their own ma&s;|ters. The charge of making a &s;ettlement in &s;uch a wilderne&s;s was more than the value of the lands when the improvements were made: over&s;eers were appointed, but they could not hold the tenants under command; nor prevent their changing places on every di&s;content: The proprietors them&s;elves never came in per&s;on to &s;uperintend their intere&s;ts, and no regular government was e&s;tabli&s;hed to puni&s;h offenders or pre&s;erve order. For the&s;e rea&s;ons though Gorges and Ma&s;on expended from fir&s;t to la&s;t more than <HI>twenty thou&s;and pounds</HI> each, yet they only opened the way for others to follow, and the money was lo&s;t to them and their po&s;terity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;tory of New-Hamp&s;hire, vol. i.

<P>Whil&s;t their private intere&s;t was thus &s;ink|ing in America, the reputation of the coun|cil of which were members lay under &s;uch di&s;advantage in England as tended to endanger their political exi&s;tence. As they had been incorporated for the purpo&s;e, not merely of
<PB N="380" REF="026637_0378_0FD1061B3206E280">
granting lands, but of making actual planta|tions in America, they were fond of encou|raging all attempts, from whatever quarter, which might realize their views and ex|pectations.</P>
<P>The eccle&s;ia&s;tical government at this time allowed no liberty to &s;crupulous con&s;ciences; for which rea&s;on many who had hitherto been peaceable members of the national church, and wi&s;hed to continue &s;uch, finding that no indulgence could be granted, turned their thoughts toward America where &s;ome of their brethren had already made a &s;ettlement. They fir&s;t purcha&s;ed of the council of Plymouth a large territory, and afterward obtained of the crown a charter, by which they were con&s;ti|tuted a body politic within the realm. In June 1630 they brought their charter to America, and began the colony of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</HI> This proved an effectual &s;ettlement, and the rea|&s;ons which rendered it &s;o were the the zeal and ardour which animated their exertions; the wealth which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which they converted into materials for a new plantation; but principally the <HI>pre&s;ence</HI> of the adventurers them&s;elves, on the &s;pot, where their fortunes were to be expended and their zeal exerted.
<PB N="381" REF="026637_0379_0FD1061CD472F858">
The difference between a man's doing bu&s;ine&s;s by him&s;elf, and by his &s;ub&s;titutes, was never more fairly exemplified than in the conduct of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts planters, compared with that of Sir Ferdinando Gorges: what the one had been labouring for, above twenty years without any &s;ucce&s;s, was realized by the others in two or three years; in five, they were &s;o far advanced as to be able to &s;end out a colo|ny from them&s;elves to begin another at Con|necticut; and in le&s;s than ten, they founded an Univer&s;ity which has ever &s;ince produc|ed an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;erviceable men in church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>The great number of people who flocked to this new plantation, rai&s;ed an alarm in Eng|land. As they had manife&s;ted their di&s;con|tent with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, it it was &s;u&s;pected that they aimed at <HI>independence,</HI> and would throw off their allegiance to the crown. This jealou&s;y was &s;o &s;trong, that a royal order was made to re&s;train any from coming hither who &s;hould not fir&s;t take the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy, and obtain a licence for their removal.</P>
<P>To refute this jealous cavil again&s;t the planters of New-England, we need only to ob|&s;erve,
<PB N="382" REF="026637_0380_0FD1061F56834A58">
that at the time when they began their &s;ettlement, and for many years after, the lands which they occupied were objects of envy both to the Dutch and French. The Dutch claimed from Hud&s;on, as far as Connecticut river, where they had erected a trading hou&s;e. The French claimed all the lands of New England; and the Governour of Port Royal, when he wrote to Governour Winthrop, direct|ed his letters to him as <HI>Governour of the Engli&s;h at Bo&s;ton in Acadia.</HI> Had the New England planters thrown off their &s;ubjection to the crown of England they mu&s;t have become a prey to one or the other of the&s;e rival powers. Of this they were well aware, and if they had entertained any idea of independency, which they certainly did not <HI>(nor did their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors till driven to it by Britain her&s;elf)</HI> it would have been the mo&s;t impolitic thing in the world to have avowed it, in the pre&s;ence of neighbours with whom they did not wi&s;h to be connected.</P>
<P>This jealou&s;y, however groundle&s;s, had an influence on the public councils of the nation, as well as on the &s;entiments of individuals, and contributed to increa&s;e the prejudice which had been formed again&s;t all who were con|cerned

in the colonization of New England. The merchants &s;till con&s;idered the Council of Plymouth, as monopolizing a lucrative branch of trade. The South Virginia company, di&s;|reli&s;hed their exclu&s;ive charter, and &s;pared no pains to get it revoked. The popular party in the commons regarded them as &s;upporters of the prerogative, and under the royal influ|ence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This manife&s;tly appears from the grant which they were o|bliged to make to Sir William Alexander, of the country of Nova Scotia, by virtue of a me&s;&s;age from the King, which they con&s;ider|ed as a command. This grant was confirmed to him by the King, and he &s;old it to the French.</NOTE> The high church party were incen&s;|ed again&s;t them as enemies of prelacy, becau&s;e they had favoured the &s;ettlement of the Puri|tans within their territory: and the King him|&s;elf &s;u&s;pected that the colonies in New Eng|land had too much liberty to con&s;i&s;t with his notions of government. Gorges was looked upon as the author of all the mi&s;chief; and being publicly called upon, declared, "that though he had earne&s;tly &s;ought the intere&s;t of the plantations, yet he could not an&s;wer for the evils which had happened by them." It was extremely mortifying to him to find that after all his exertions and expen&s;es in the &s;er|vice of the nation, he had become a very un|popular character, and had enemies on all &s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="026637_0382_0FD1062197A71978">To remedy the&s;e difficulties, he projected the re&s;ignation of the charter to the crown; and the divi&s;ion of the territory into twelve lord&s;hips, to be united under one General Gov|ernour. As the charter of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;tood in the way of this project, he, in conjunction with Ma&s;on, petitioned the crown for a revo|cation of it. This brought on him the ill will of tho&s;e coloni&s;ts al&s;o, who from that time regarded him and Ma&s;on as their enemies. Before the council &s;urrendered their charter, they made grants to &s;ome of their own mem|bers, of twelve di&s;tricts, from Maryland to St. Croix, among which the di&s;trict from Pi&s;cata|qua to Sagadahock, extending one hundred and twenty miles northward into the country, was a&s;&s;igned to Gorges. In June 1635, the coun|cil re&s;igned their charter, and petitioned the King and the lords of the privy council for a confirmation of the &s;everal proprietary grants, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a general government. Sir Ferdinando Gorges, then three &s;core years of age, was the per&s;on nominated to be the General Governor. About this time, Ma&s;on, one of the principal actors in this affair, was removed by death: and a &s;hip, which was in|tended for the &s;ervice of the new government,

fell and broke in launching. A <HI>quo warranto</HI> was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts charter, but the proceedings upon it were delayed, and never completed. An order of the King in council, was al&s;o i&s;&s;ued in 1637, for the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of the general government, and Gor|ges was therein appointed Governour; but the troubles in Scotland and England, at this time grew very &s;erious and put a check to the bu&s;i|ne&s;s. Soon after, Archbi&s;hop Laud and &s;ome other lords of council, who were zealous in the affair, lo&s;t their authority, and the whole project came to nothing.</P>
<P>Gorges however, obtained of the crown in 1639, a confirmation of his own grant, which was &s;tyled the <HI>Province of Maine,</HI> and of which he was made Lord Palatine with the &s;ame powers and privileges as the bi&s;hop of Durham in the County Palatine of Durham. In virtue of the&s;e powers, he con&s;tituted a government within his &s;aid province, and in|corporated the plantation at Agamenticus in|to a city, by the name of <HI>Gorgeana,</HI> of which his cou&s;in, Thomas Gorges, was Mayor, who re&s;ided there about two years, and then return|ed to England. The council for the admin|i&s;tration of government were Sir Thomas

Jo&s;&s;elyn, Knight, Richard Vines, (Steward) Francis Champernoon (a nephew to Gorges,) Henry Jo&s;&s;elyn, Richard Boniton, William Hooke, and Edward Godfrey.</P>
<P>The plan which he formed for the govern|ment of his province was this: It was to be divided into eight counties, and the&s;e into &s;ixteen hundreds, the hundreds were to be &s;ubdivided into pari&s;hes and tythings, as the people &s;hould increa&s;e. In the ab&s;ence of the proprietor a lieutenant was to pre&s;ide. A chancellor was con&s;tituted for the deci&s;ion of civil cau&s;es; a trea&s;urer to receive the revenue, a mar&s;hal for managing the militia, and a mar&s;hal's court, for criminal matters; an ad|miral, and admiral's court, for maritime cau&s;es; a ma&s;ter of ordnance and a &s;ecretary. The&s;e officers were to be a &s;tanding council. Eight deputies were to be elected, one from each county, by the inhabitants, to &s;it in the &s;ame council; and all matters of moment were to be determined by the lieutenant with advice of the majority. This council were to ap|point ju&s;tices, to give licences for the &s;ale of lands <HI>&s;ubject to a rent of four pence or &s;ix pence per acre.</HI> When any law was to be enacted or repealed, or public money to be rai&s;ed,
<PB N="387" REF="026637_0385_0FD0F9924FBD6758">
they were to call on the counties to elect each two deputies, "to join with the council in the performance of the &s;ervice;" but nothing is &s;aid of their voting as a &s;eparate hou&s;e. One lieutenant and eight ju&s;tices were allowed to each county; two head con&s;tables to every hundred; one con&s;table and four tythingmen to every pari&s;h; and in conformity to the in|&s;titutions of King Alfred, each tythingman was to give an account of the demeanor of the families within his tything, to the con&s;table of the pari&s;h, who was to render the &s;ame to the head con&s;tables of the hundred, and they to the lieutenant and ju&s;tices of the county; who were to take cognizance of all mi&s;demean|ors; and from them an appeal might be made to the proprietor's lieutenant and council.</P>
<P>Forms of government, and plans of &s;ettle|ment, are much more ea&s;ily drawn on paper, than carried into execution. Few people could be induced to become tenants in the neighbourhood of &s;uch a colony as Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, where <HI>all were freeholders.</HI> No provi|&s;ion was made for public in&s;titutions; &s;chools were unknown, and they had no mini&s;ters, till in pity to their deplorable &s;tate, two went thither from Bo&s;ton on a voluntary mi&s;&s;ion,

and were well received by them. The city of Gorgeana, though a lofty name, was in fact but an incon&s;iderable village; and there were only a few hou&s;es in &s;ome of the be&s;t places for navigation. The people were without order and morals, and it was &s;aid of &s;ome of them, that "they had as many &s;hares in a <HI>woman,</HI> as they had in a fi&s;hing boat."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hutchin&s;on's Collection of Papers, p. 424.</NOTE> Gor|ges him&s;elf complained of the prodigality of his &s;ervants, and had very little confidence in his own &s;ons, for who&s;e aggrandizement he had been labouring to e&s;tabli&s;h a foundation. He had indeed erected &s;aw mills and corn mills, and had received &s;ome acknowledgment in the way of rents, but lamented, that he had not reaped the "happy &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e who are <HI>their own</HI> &s;tewards, and the di&s;po&s;ers of <HI>their own</HI> affairs."</P>
<P>How long Gorges continued in his office as Governour of Plymouth, does not appear from any materials within my reach. In 1625, he commanded a &s;hip of war in a &s;quad|ron under the Duke of Buckingham, which was &s;ent to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France, under pre|tence of being employed again&s;t the Genoe&s;e.

de&s;tined to a&s;&s;i&s;t Louis again&s;t his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects at Rochelle, as &s;oon as they were ar|rived at Dieppe, and found that they had been deceived, Gorges was the fir&s;t to break his orders and return with his &s;hip to England. The others followed his example, and their zeal for the Prote&s;tant religion was much ap|plauded.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume.</NOTE></P>
<P>When the civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions in England broke out into a war, Gorges took the royal &s;ide; and, though then far advanced in years, engaged per&s;onally in the &s;ervice of the crown. He was in Prince Rupert's army at the &s;iege of Bri&s;tol in 1643; and when that city was re|taken in 1645 by the parliament's forces, he was plundered and impri&s;oned.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;&s;elyn &s;ays that he was <HI>&s;everal times</HI> plundered and impri|&s;oned. p. 197.</NOTE> His politi|cal principles rendered him obnoxious to the ruling powers, and when it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to appear before the commi&s;&s;ioners for foreign plantations, he was &s;everely frowned upon, and con&s;equently di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>The time of his death is uncertain; he is &s;poken of in the records of the Province of Maine <HI>as dead</HI> in June 1647. Upon his de|cea&s;e, his e&s;tate fell to his elde&s;t &s;on, John

Gorges, who, whether di&s;couraged by his father's ill &s;ucce&s;s, or incapacitated by the &s;everity of the times, took no care of the prov|ince, nor do we find any thing memorable concerning him. Mo&s;t of the commi&s;&s;ioners who had been appointed to govern the prov|ince de&s;erted it; and the remaining inhabit|ants in 1649, were obliged to combine for their own &s;ecurity. In 1651, they petitioned the Council of State that they might be con|&s;idered as part of the commonwealth of Eng|land. The next year, upon the reque&s;t of a great part of the inhabitants, the colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts took them under their protec|tion, being &s;uppo&s;ed to be within the limits of their charter; &s;ome oppo&s;ition was made to this &s;tep; but the majority &s;ubmitted or acquie&s;ced; and con&s;idering the difficulties of the times, and the un&s;ettled &s;tate of affairs in England, this was the be&s;t expedient for their &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>On the death of John Gorges, the proprie|ty de&s;cended to his &s;on Ferdinando Gorges, of We&s;tmin&s;ter, who &s;eems to have been a man of information and activity. He printed a de&s;cription of New England in 1658, to which he annexed a narrative written by his grand|father;
<PB N="391" REF="026637_0389_0FD10633847C4508">
from which this account is chiefly compiled; but another piece which in &s;ome editions is tacked to the&s;e, entitled "Wonder working Providences," was unfairly a&s;cribed to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, though written by a Mr. John&s;on of Woburn in New England.</P>
<P>On the re&s;toration of King Charles II. Gorges petitioned the crown, complaining of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts colony for u&s;urping the government of Maine, and extending their boundary lines. In 1664, commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ent to America, who finding the people in the Province of Maine divided in their opin|ions with re&s;pect to matters of government, appointed ju&s;tices in the King's name to gov|ern them; and about the &s;ame time the pro|prietor nominated thirteen commi&s;&s;ioners and prepared a &s;et of in&s;tructions which were en|tered on the records of the province. But upon the departure of the royal commi&s;&s;ion|ers the colony re&s;umed its juri&s;diction over them. The&s;e two &s;ources of government kept alive two parties, each of whom were always ready to complain of the other and ju&s;tify them&s;elves.</P>
<P>An inquiry into the conduct of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts had been in&s;tituted in England, and the
<PB N="392" REF="026637_0390_0FD1063600947000">
colony was ordered to &s;end over agents to an|&s;wer the complaints of Gorges, and Ma&s;on, the proprietor of New Hamp&s;hire, who had joint|ly propo&s;ed to &s;ell their property to the crown to make a government for the Duke of Mon|mouth. This propo&s;al not being accepted, the colony them&s;elves took the hint, and thought the mo&s;t effectual way of &s;ilencing the complaint would be, to make a purcha&s;e. The circum&s;tances of the Province of Maine were &s;uch as to favour their views. The In|dians had invaded it, mo&s;t of the &s;ettlements were de&s;troyed or de&s;erted, and the whole country was in trouble; the colony had af|forded them all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which was in their power, and they had no help from any other quarter. In the height of this calamity John U&s;her, E&s;q. was employed to negociate with Mr. Gorges for the purcha&s;e of the whole territory, which was effected in the year 1677. The &s;um of <HI>twelve hundred and fifty pounds</HI> &s;terling was paid for it, and it has ever &s;ince been a part of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.

<P><PB N="397" REF="026637_0395_0FD1064BBB718780">The highe&s;t latitude which he made in this voyage was 71&deg; 46&prime;; where he found the &s;ea in the neighbourhood of Nova Zembla &s;o fill|ed with ice, and covered with fogs, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s the &s;trait of Waygats to the ea&s;tward. He therefore tacked and &s;teered we&s;terly, toward Greenland; intending to fall in with Bu&s;s I&s;land, which had been &s;een by one of Frobi&s;her's &s;hips in 1578; but when he came into the latitude where it was laid down, he could not find it.</P>
<P>He then &s;teered &s;outhwe&s;terly; pa&s;&s;ed the banks of Newfoundland among the French &s;hips which were fi&s;hing, without &s;peaking with any of them; and &s;ailed along the coa&s;t of America. In this route he di&s;covered Cape Cod and landed there; then pur&s;ued his cour&s;e to the &s;outh and we&s;t; making remarks on the &s;oundings and currents, till he came to the entrance of Che&s;apeak bay. Here he plied off and on for &s;everal days, and then turned again to the northward.</P>
<P>In his return along the coa&s;t, on the 28th of Augu&s;t he di&s;covered the great bay, now called Delaware, in the latitude of 39&deg; 5&prime;. In this bay he examined the &s;oundings and
<PB N="398" REF="026637_0396_0FD1064E4BB9ADB0">
currents, and the appearance of the land; but did not go on &s;hore.</P>
<P>From this bay, pa&s;&s;ing along a low mar&s;hy coa&s;t &s;kirted with broken i&s;lands, on the 2d of September he &s;aw high hills to the northward; which I &s;uppo&s;e were the Nev|er&s;inks in New Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P>On the 4th of September, he came to an|chor in "a very good harbour" in the latitude 40&deg; 30&prime;, which is the bay within Sandy Hook. On the 6th, the boat was &s;ent to &s;urvey what appeared to be the mouth of a river, di&s;tant four leagues. This was the &s;treet called the Narrows, between Long I&s;land and Staten I&s;land; here was a good depth of water; and within was a large opening, and a narrow river, to the we&s;t; the channel between Ber|gen Neck and Staten I&s;land. As the boat was returning, it was attacked by &s;ome of the natives, in two canoes. One man, John Colman, was killed; he was buried on a point of land, which, from that circum&s;tance, was called Colman's point. It is probably Sandy Hook, within which the &s;hip lay.</P>
<P>On the 11th, they &s;ailed through the Nar|rows, and found a "good harbour &s;ecure from all winds." The next day, they turned again&s;t
<PB N="399" REF="026637_0397_0FD10650EC18B628">
a N. W. wind, into the mouth of the river, which bears Hud&s;on's name; and came to anchor two leagues within it. On the&s;e two days, they were vi&s;ited by the natives, who brought corn, beans, oy&s;ters and tobacco. They had pipes of copper, in which they &s;moked; and earthen pots, in which they dre&s;&s;ed their meat. Hud&s;on would not &s;uffer them to &s;tay on board by night.</P>
<P>From the 12th to the 19th of September, he &s;ailed up the river; which he found about a mile wide and of a good depth, abounding with fi&s;h, among which were "great &s;tore of &s;almons." As he advanced, the land on both &s;ides was high, till it became very mountain|ous. This "high land had many points, the channel was narrow, and there were many eddy winds."</P>
<P>From a careful enumeration of the com|puted di&s;tances, in each day's run, as &s;et down in the journal, it appears that Hud&s;on &s;ailed fifty three leagues. To this di&s;tance, the river was navigable, for the &s;hip; the boat went up eight or ten leagues farther; but found the bottom irregular, and the depth not more than &s;even feet. It is evident therefore that
<PB N="400" REF="026637_0398_0FD106B5217A34A8">
he penetrated this river, as far as where the city of Albany now &s;tands.</P>
<P>The farther he went up the river, the more friendly and ho&s;pitable the natives appeared. They gave him &s;kins in exchange for knives and other trifles. But as he came down, be|low the mountains, the &s;avages were thievi&s;h and trouble&s;ome, which occa&s;ioned frequent quarrels, in which eight or nine of them were killed. The land on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the river near its mouth, was called <HI>Manahata.</HI></P>
<P>On the 4th of October he came out of the river; and without anchoring in the bay, &s;tood out to &s;ea; and &s;teering directly for Europe, on the 7th of November arrived "in the range of Dartmouth in Devon&s;hire." Here the journal ends.</P>
<P>The di&s;coveries made by Hud&s;on, in this remarkable voyage, were of great mercantile con&s;equence to his employers. It has been &s;aid, that he "&s;old the country, or rather his right to it, to the Dutch."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith's hi&s;tory of New York, p. 14. Carey's edition.</NOTE> This however is que&s;tionable. The &s;overeigns of England and France laid equal claim to the country, and it is a matter which requires &s;ome di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, whether the Hollanders were, at that time, &s;o

They had, for &s;ome time before, ca&s;t an eye on the fur trade; and had even bribed &s;ome Frenchmen, to admit them into the traffic at Acadia and St. Lawrence. The di&s;covery of Hud&s;on's river, gave them at once, an entrance of above fifty leagues into the heart of the American continent; in a &s;itua|tion, where the be&s;t furs could be procured without any interruption from either the French or the Engli&s;h. The place indeed lay within the claim of both the&s;e nations: Acadia extended from the latitude of 40&deg; to 48&deg;; and Virginia from 34&deg; to 45&deg;; but the French had made &s;everal fruitle&s;s attempts to pa&s;s &s;outhward of Cape Cod; and had but ju&s;t begun their plantations at Acadia and St. Lawrence. The Engli&s;h had made &s;ome ef|forts to e&s;tabli&s;h colonies in Virginia, one of

which was &s;truggling for exi&s;tence, and others had failed, both in the &s;outhern and northern divi&s;ion. Be&s;ides, King James, by a &s;troke of policy <HI>peculiar to him&s;elf,</HI> in dividing Virginia, between the North and South Companies, had <HI>interlocked</HI> each patent with the other; and at the &s;ame time <HI>interdicted</HI> the patentees from planting within one hundred miles of each other.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 41, 42.

<P>But whether it can, at this time, be deter|mined or not, by what means the Holland|ers acquired a title to the country; certain it is, that they under&s;tood and pur&s;ued the ad|vantage which this di&s;covery opened to them. Within four years, a fort and trading hou&s;e were erected on the &s;pot where Albany is now built; and another fort on the S. W. point of the i&s;land, where the city of New-York
<PB N="403" REF="026637_0401_0FD0F9A51FD9C348">
now &s;tands; by a company of Merchants, who had procured from the States General a patent for an exclu&s;ive trade to Hud&s;on's river.</P>
<P>The tran&s;actions between Hud&s;on and his Dutch employers are not &s;tated in the ac|counts of his voyages. Dr. For&s;ter &s;ays that he offered to undertake another voyage in their &s;ervice, but that they declined it, upon which he returned to England; and again entered into the &s;ervice of the Company, who had before employed him.</P>
<P>The former attempts for a northern pa&s;&s;age having been made in very high latitudes, it was now determined, to &s;eek for one, by pa&s;&s;ing to the we&s;tward of Greenland, and examining the inlets of the American continent. For this purpo&s;e a &s;hip was fitted out, and the command was given to Hud&s;on; but, unhap|pily, the Company in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould take with him as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, one Colburne, a very very able and experienced &s;eaman. Their great confidence in Colburne's &s;kill excited Hud&s;on's envy; and after the &s;hip had fallen down the river, he put him on board a pink, bound up to London, with a letter to the owners, containing the rea&s;ons of his con|duct;
<PB N="404" REF="026637_0402_0FD106536B291280">
and then proceeded on his voyage. [April 22, 1610.] This ra&s;h &s;tep gave the crew an example of di&s;obedience, which was &s;o &s;everely retaliated on him&s;elf, as to prove the cau&s;e of his ruin.</P>
<P>He went round the north of Scotland, through the Orkney and Faro i&s;lands, and on the 11th of May made the ea&s;tern part of Iceland. Sailing along its &s;outhern &s;hore, in &s;ight of the volcanic mountain Hecla, he put into a harbour in the we&s;tern part of the i&s;land; where he met with a friendly reception from the inhabitants; but found great di&s;&s;en&s;ions among his crew, which he could not appea&s;e without much difficulty.</P>
<P>Having doubled the &s;outhern promontory of Greenland, he &s;teered N. W. for the Ameri|can continent. In this pa&s;&s;age he was &s;o en|tangled with floating ice, that he almo&s;t de&s;pair|ed of getting clear. But at length, with much labour and peril, he forced his way through the &s;trait and into the bay which bear his name. The farther he advanced, the greater were the murmurings among his men. He removed his mate and boat&s;wain and put others into their places. This di&s;cipline not only rendered him more unpopular; but inflamed the di&s;placed officers with bitter re&s;entment again&s;t him.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="026637_0403_0FD10655788E4198">The whole &s;ummer having been &s;pent, in examining the ea&s;tern and &s;outhern extremities of the deep and exten&s;ive bay, which he had di&s;covered; in October it was too late to re|turn; the di&s;covery was yet incomplete, and he was loth to leave it. He had taken but half a year's provi&s;ion from England. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to hu&s;band what was left, and procure more by hunting; which was done in great plenty, by rea&s;on of the numer|ous flights of fowl, which &s;ucceeded each other through the winter.</P>
<P>In November the &s;hip was frozen up. Soon after the gunner died, and a controver&s;y took place about dividing his clothes. Hud&s;on was partial to Henry Green, a young man of a debauched character, whom he had taken on board; and who&s;e name was not on the &s;hip's books. This young man ungenerou&s;ly took part with the di&s;contented, and lo&s;t Hud&s;on's favour.</P>
<P>They had to &s;truggle with a &s;evere winter, and bad accommodations, which produced &s;corbutic and rheumatic complaints. The&s;e were relieved by a decoction of the buds of a tree filled with a bal&s;amic juice; the liquor was drank, and the buds applied to the &s;welled joints. This is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the <HI>Populus bal&s;amifera.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="026637_0404_0FD1065A74367098">When the &s;pring came on, the birds di&s;ap|peared, and their provi&s;ions fell &s;hort. To &s;till the clamour among the di&s;contented, Hud&s;on injudiciou&s;ly divided the remaining &s;tores, into equal &s;hares, and gave each man his portion; which &s;ome devoured at once and others pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>The &s;hip being afloat, he began to &s;ail to|ward the N. W. to pur&s;ue the object of his voyage; when, (June 21, 1611) a con&s;pira|cy which had been &s;ometime in fermentation, broke out into open mutiny. The di&s;placed mate and boat&s;wain, accompanied by the in|famous Green and others, ro&s;e and took com|mand of the &s;hip. They put Hud&s;on, his &s;on, the carpenter, the mathematician, and five others, mo&s;t of whom were &s;ick and lame, into the &s;hallop; with a &s;mall quantity of meal, one gun and ammunition, two or three &s;pears and an iron pot; and then with the mo&s;t &s;avage inhumanity turned them adrift. This is the la&s;t account of Hud&s;on. Wheth|er he, with his unhappy companions, peri&s;hed by the &s;ea, by famine, or by the &s;avages, is unknown.</P>
<P>The con&s;pirators put the &s;hip about to the ea&s;tward and ha&s;ted to get out of the bay. Near Cape Digges, they met with &s;even canoes of the &s;avages, by whom they were attacked.
<PB N="407" REF="026637_0405_0FD1065C9BEBC038">
The perfidious Green was killed, and three others wounded, of whom two died in a few days. The mi&s;erable remnant, pur&s;ued their cour&s;e homeward, and &s;uffered much by fam|ine; but at length arrived in Ireland, and from thence got to England.</P>
<P>This account of the unfortunate end of Hud&s;on and the return of the &s;hip, is taken from a narrative written by Abacuc Pricket,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Purchas, iv, 597.</NOTE> whom the mutineers pre&s;erved, in hope that by his connexion with Sir Dudley Digges, one of the owners, they &s;hould obtain their pardon.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing circum&s;tance in this horrid act of cruelty, is the oath, by which the con&s;pirators bound them&s;elves to execute their plot; the form of it is pre&s;erved by Pricket, and is in the&s;e words.</P>
<P>"You &s;hall &s;wear truth, to GOD, your Prince and Country; you &s;hall do nothing but to the Glory of GOD, and the good of the action in hand, and harm to no man." It is to be hoped, that the ab&s;urdity, hypoc|ri&s;y, and bla&s;phemy of this tran&s;action will ever be unparalleled in the hi&s;tory of human depravity!</P>

<P>THE author is &s;o much indebted to HAKLUYT and PURCHAS, that he thinks it but ju&s;t to give &s;ome account of them and their writings.</P>
<P>RICHARD HAKLUYT, Prebendary of We&s;tmin&s;ter, was born in Hereford&s;hire, 1553. He early turned his attention to geo|graphy, and read lectures in that &s;cience at Oxford, where he was educated, and where he introduced maps and globes, into the pub|lic &s;chools. In 1582 he publi&s;hed a &s;mall collection of voyages and di&s;coveries; and going two years after as chaplain to Sir Ed|ward Stafford amba&s;&s;ador to France, he there met with and publi&s;hed a M. S. entitled, <HI>The Notable Hi&s;tory of Florida, by Laudon|nierre and other Adventurers.</HI> He returned to England in 1588, when he applied him&s;elf to collect, tran&s;late and dige&s;t all the voyages, journals and letters that he could procure, which he publi&s;hed fir&s;t in one volume, 1589, to which he afterward added two others, and reprinted the fir&s;t in 1599, and 1600. He was a man of indefatigable diligence and great integrity; much in favour with Queen Elizabeth's mini&s;try, and largely conver&s;ant

with &s;eamen. He died in 1616, and his ma|nu&s;cripts fell into the hands of Mr. Purchas.</P>
<P>[Wood and Northouck.]</P>
<P>A complete &s;et of Hakluyt's Voyages is in the library of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Hi&s;torical Society.</P>
<P>SAMUEL PURCHAS was born at Thack|&s;tead in E&s;&s;ex, 1577, and educated at Cam|bridge. He was fir&s;t vicar of Ea&s;twood in E&s;&s;ex, then rector of St. Martin's London. He publi&s;hed a folio volume entitled, <HI>Purchas his Pilgrimage, or Relations of the World and the Religions ob&s;erved, in all Ages and Places,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>third</HI> edition of it, is dated 1617. When Mr. Hakluyt's papers fell into his hands he compiled four other volumes, which were printed 1625; they are entitled, <HI>Purchas his Pilgrims.</HI> Part i, ii, iii, iv. The whole makes a &s;et of five volumes. They con&s;i&s;t of journals, letters, narratives, tran&s;lations and abridgements, comprehending all the travels and di&s;coveries made in all parts of the world, and are, with Hakluyt's work, the large&s;t and mo&s;t authentic collection of the kind, extant for that time. By the publi&s;hing of this vol|uminous work, Purchas brought him&s;elf into
