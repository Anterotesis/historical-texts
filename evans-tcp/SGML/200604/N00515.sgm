<P>THE Sermon here presented unto you, was Delivered in your Audience; by that unworthy Instrument, who did formerly spend some years among you, in the work of the <HI>Ministry,</HI> though attended with manifold <HI>sinful failings</HI> and infirmities, for which I do <HI>implore,</HI> the Pardoning <HI>Mercy</HI> of God in Jesus Christ, and <HI>in|treat</HI> from you the <HI>Covering</HI> of Love. As this was prepared, for that Particular Occasion, when it was delivered amongst you; so the <HI>Publication</HI> of it, is to be Particularly recommended to your service.</P>
<P>My hearts <HI>desire,</HI> and Continual <HI>Prayer,</HI> to God for you ALL is; that you may be <HI>saved</HI> in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ, and accordingly that all means He is using with you, by <HI>Mercies</HI> &amp; <HI>Afflictions, Ordinances</HI> and <HI>Providences,</HI> may be Sanctifyed, to the building you up in G<HI>race</HI> and <HI>Holyness,</HI> and preparing you for the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of Glory. We are told by the <HI>Apostle,</HI> Acts 14. 22: <HI>That through many Tribulations, we must enter into the Kingdom of God.</HI> Now since (besides your share in the Common <HI>Calamities,</HI> under the burden whereof, this poor people are <HI>groaning</HI> at this time the Righteous and Holy God, hath been pleased
<PB REF="000643_0006_0FA961C68E7CEC60">
to <HI>permit</HI> a sore and grievous affliction <HI>to befall you</HI> such as can hardly be said to be <HI>Common</HI> to men <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> By giving liberty to <HI>SATAN;</HI> to range and rage amongst you, to the <HI>Torturing</HI> the Bodies, and <HI>Distracting</HI> the Minds, of some of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>sheep</HI> and <HI>Lambs,</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ. And (which is yet more <HI>astonishing</HI>) he who is <HI>THE ACCU|SER</HI> of the <HI>Bretheren,</HI> endeavours to <HI>introduce</HI> as Criminal, some of the <HI>visible</HI> Subjects of Christ's <HI>Kingdom,</HI> by whose sober and godly Conversation in times past, we could draw no other <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> than that they were real members of His <HI>Mystical</HI> Body, representing them, as the <HI>Instruments</HI> of his malice, against their Friends and Neighbours.</P>
<P>I thought meet thus to give you the best <HI>assistance</HI> I could, to help you <HI>out</HI> of your dis|tresses. And since <HI>the wayes of the Lord,</HI> in his <HI>Permissive,</HI> as well as <HI>Effective</HI> Providence, <HI>are unsearchable and his doings past finding out.</HI> And <HI>Pious</HI> souls, are at a loss, what will be the <HI>Is|sue</HI> of these things.

<HEAD>TO THE Reader.</HEAD>
<P>AMongst all the great and sore Afflicti|ons, with which the Soveraign and Holy God, hath visited this his Poor People; there is none more full of <HI>amazing</HI> Considerations, and <HI>Distressing</HI> Influences, than that of his Permitting Satan, to Range and Rage in the midst of us, by his direful Opera|tions <HI>Afflicting</HI> some in a most fearful and un|usual manner, and accordingly <HI>accusing</HI> others, as the Instruments of his malice, in those Dia|bolical Tortures; And how much <HI>further</HI> it may proceed, or <HI>longer</HI> it shall continue, is only known to him, Who <HI>giveth no Account of his Mat|ters,</HI> to any of the Children of men.</P>
<P>I being Occasionally at S<HI>alem</HI>-Village, upon a visit when this Affliction was newly; come upon them, was desired to Preach among them; and this <HI>D</HI>iscourse (for the substance of it) was then Delivered. The Copy whereof being desired, by some Friends here, who were wil|ling to Contribute towards the publication of it; Not knowing but that God which gives S<HI>eed to the Sower, and Bread to the Eater.</HI> Who
<PB REF="000643_0009_0FA961C8CB814C18">
<HI>chuseth the things that are not</HI> as if they were; ha|ving pleased to make it acceptable to the Hearers, might also vouchsafe to make it profi|table to the Readers. I have yielded to their desire, that it might be thus exposed to publick view. Which also I have, much the rather done, that I may (the best I can at so great a distance as the other <HI>England</HI>) make humble tender of most dutiful Observances, to my Ho|noured Father (if yet on this side the Man|sions of Eternal Rest) as a Pepper-corn ac|knowledgment, of all his unrequiteable <HI>Care, Cast,</HI> and <HI>Pains,</HI> in my Education; Entreat|ing his Acceptance, of what I hope I may truly say, the Lord hath <HI>brought unto me,</HI> that his Soul may <HI>Bless the before he dyes:</HI> And that I may obtain the continuance of those servent Prayers, and affectionate benedictions, in the Name of God; which I have throughout my whole life been under the refreshing influences of; but more especially, since I was called to the Ministry; as appears by a Letter directed to me, at <HI>Martha's Vineyard,</HI> Dated <HI>January</HI> 20 1676. wherein he bespeaks me, and God for me, in such Expressions as these. <Q>And will the Lord Remember for me his Glorious Name; A God hearing Prayer; and make my heart rejoyce even mine, in a Son whose Eyes the Lord hath opened, and whose heart as <HI>Japhets</HI> he hath perswaded and enlarged,
<PB REF="000643_0010_0FA961C98D25EFB0">
to serve him in that work, whereunto Parents had designed him; and for which they begged him as a loan. And hath the Lord allured you: and brought you into a wilderness, to speak comfortably unto you; and give you <HI>Vineyards from thence,</HI> And will the Lord Indeed, Zach 10, 9. Take of my seed, and sow among the Gentiles, to remember him in far countries <HI>that they may live with their Children, and turn again.</HI> Gen 49: 18. <HI>I wait for by salvation O Lord.</HI> And Praise waits in silence, from my soul in, Zion, when he shall further evidence his Return to you in mercy, and your Return to him in Covenanted Duty. Now the good Lord; who hath pleased to put you into his service, put a Rich anointing of his Spirit upon you, Make you <HI>Wisehearted, skilful, Faithful, Painful,</HI> and <HI>Successful</HI> in the service of his Ta|bernacle; and set many a Pearl in your Crown, in Conversion of Sinners, and Edification of Con|verts. The Lord T<HI>he Angel of the Covenant, that Redeems my soul from all evil,</HI> Bless you, and lay the Foundations of a Family for you in Righ|teousness: so building up my house in yours, and yours in wholly a <HI>Right seed,</HI> that may be accounted to him for a <HI>generation,</HI> that he may build up his own in both. (that so you and yours may do worthily in <HI>Ephratha,</HI> and Famous|ly in <HI>Israel.</HI> Now to him <HI>that is able to keep you from falling, and to Build you up, and give

you an Inheritance, among them that are Sanctified.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I Commend you with Incessant Prayers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> With the same fervour of Holy Zeal and Af|fection, he exprest himself by Letters to Mr. <HI>Thomas Mayhew,</HI> late Governour of <HI>Martha's</HI> Vineyard; that good old <HI>Simeon,</HI> who about Ten Years ago, had his <HI>Nunc dimittis,</HI> into the Mansions of <HI>E</HI>verlasting <HI>Peace;</HI> particularly upon the Receipt of <HI>L</HI>etters, from the Mini|sters of <HI>Boston</HI> concerning me. Thus his Letter begins. <Q>I understand by Letters from my Son, that the Lord hath lengthened out your life, to a good old age, and Crowned your grey Head with a Gracious Heart, found in the way of Righteousness, which I longed to hear, and rejoyce much at the hearing of; as good News from a far Country; But much more, in those Concomitant Letters, from several Ministers, whose Praise is in the <HI>G</HI>ospel; Re|commending my Son <HI>Deodat</HI> with their con|current Testimonies, of his walking in the Truth, with his Yoke-fellow, in all Godly Conversation, as Heirs of the Grace of Life, for which my heart rejoyceth in the Lord, as seeing the Priat of the Fingers, as a Return of Prayer upon it. Blessed be the God of <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> into whose Living Arms, his Dying Mother (within a few weeks after his birth,) by the hand of Faith presented him, and by Prayer Dedicated him
<PB REF="000643_0012_0FA961CB0F012408">
to his Service in the Gospel.</Q> And Oh! that these pious Wishes, and fervent prayers, may be heard and answered by the Lord accordingly.</P>
<P>However the serious Consideration, of such a solemne Designation of me, by both my Parents, to the service of God in the Ministry; Secon|ded by my Fathers proportionable endeavours, in my Education (both in Schoole and Colledge learneing) hath engaged my heart and soul, to attend thereunto, if so the will of the Lord be. And whereas by my Fathers being silenced, and his Estate much weakened, I was hindred of some Academical Preferments, and after-Six Yeares Standing at Colledg, necessitated to make digression to secular affaires; yet I found from time to time, the Soveraigne Providence of God, in a continued series, disappointing, and frown|ing upon me: so that I trust, the Lord hath been by his Grace and Spirit, carrying on a good work in my Soul, thereby the better to fit me, for future service to him and his People in my generation. Under the influence of these considerations, I have still reserved my self at li|berty, from worldly entanglements any further then duty bound me, to prevent <HI>Infidel-Negligence</HI> of my Family. I <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 8. And I do seri|ously declare; that whatsoever hath hindred, my whole and sole, devoting my <HI>Time, Strength,</HI> and <HI>All,</HI> to the service of God in the Ministry; hath
<PB REF="000643_0013_0FA961CE190CA8A0">
been for many years, and still is, my burthen and not my choice.</P>
<P>Although the Unkindnesses, and Reflections, hard Travails and difficulties; I have met with, in that service, had long ere now, Totally discouraged me, had not the Lord by the assistance of his grace, strongly inclined me thereunto. Out of design to glorify God therein, and not for any secular advantages accruing thereby. And I do further profess, that I do earnestly desire, by divine assistance to Do all, and Be all, unto the Glory of God; declaring, that whatsoever either in word or deed, I have been overtaken by, tending to the dishonour of God, or the grief of any sincere souls, I do desire, and will endeavour, by the assistance of his Grace and Spirit to reform it; though ne|ver so <HI>pleasing</HI> to the Flesh, or agreeable to Natu|ral Constitution, and be humbly thankful, to such as shall give me notice thereof. Or did I know and duty I allowed my self in the neglect of, I would by the help of the same grace, come up to the practice of it, tho' never so <HI>contrary</HI> to Flesh and Blood. And wherein I have at any time, given just offence, to the meanest of those that fear the Lord, I do heartily beg their <HI>Pitty</HI> and <HI>Prayers,</HI> that the God of all grace, would pardon and heal, what is past for his names sake. strengthning my soul, in all holy resolutions, and endeavours, to walk more <HI>Circumspectly</HI> for the future, <HI>Redeeming the time,</HI> or trading with it, to my Spiritual and
<PB REF="000643_0014_0FA961CF47234D10">
Eternal advantage; in all things <HI>Adorning the Doctrine, of God my Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>And although, in thus obliging my soul to God, I do labour under many sinful frailties and Infirmities yet the sincerity of my heart in the maine, is now before the Omniscient God, and will be revealed, when Jesus Christ shall Judge the secrets of all hearts, at his appearance and his Kingdom. I commit these things to the Readers Consideration, and the Ensuing discourse to his Perusal: Earnestly intreating, the incessant Prayers, of all my <HI>Relations, Friends</HI> and <HI>Readers,</HI> that the Lord would please to assist me, by his Holy Spirit to <HI>Do</HI> or <HI>Suffer,</HI> whatsoever he shall call me unto, in my passage through this vail o teares: To the Glory of his Great Name, and the good of others, that so I may, in the Day of ac|count, inherit that <HI>Blessedness,</HI> which shall be the everlasting portion, of <HI>that servant whom his Lord when he cometh, shall find so doing.</HI> Who am</P>

<P>IT seemed good to the Great and Glorious God, the Infinite and Eternal <HI>ELOHIM</HI> in the beginning, to Create the <HI>Heavens</HI> and the <HI>Earth;</HI> and together <HI>with</HI> and <HI>in</HI> the Third Heavens, a numberless
<PB N="2" REF="000643_0016_0FA961D0592364F0">
number of glorious <HI>Angels;</HI> that were Ordained to <HI>do</HI> his Pleasure, and <HI>obey</HI> his Commands. To these he appointed (as a <HI>tryal</HI> of their obe|dience) a <HI>Ministration</HI> in this lower world, for the good of the Children of Men, and especi|ally of the <HI>Heirs of Salvation.</HI> But a number of these <HI>Intelligent Spirits,</HI> being unwilling (as some Learned conceive) to yield their Service to man, of so much an inferiour nature to themselves being made of Earth: They Rebelled against the Will of their Soveraign Lord and Creator; For which their <HI>borrid</HI> Transgression, they were by the Righteous Judgment of God; thrust down from that Glorious Place, which was once Ap|pointed to be <HI>their own Habitation,</HI> into the Lake of Eternal Perdition, there to be <HI>Reserved in Chains of Darkness, to the Judgment of the Great Day.</HI> Jude 6. SATAN himself <HI>then,</HI> and all his accursed Legions being Fallen into a miserable and irrecoverable Estate, are filled with Envy <HI>at</HI> and Malice <HI>against,</HI> all Mankind; and do set themselves by all ways and means, to work their Ruine and Destruction for ever: Opposing to the utmost, all <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Things,</HI> Appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ, as Means or Instru|ments of their Comfort here, or Salvation here|after. Hence when <HI>Joshua</HI> (the <HI>Type</HI> of JESUS) stood to Minister, as <HI>High Priest</HI> before the Lord, to make Atonemement for the People of his Covenant; SATAN stands at his Right-hand,
<PB N="3" REF="000643_0017_0FA961D10FBBF828">
to <HI>withstand</HI> and <HI>oppose</HI> him in his Ministrati|on: which the Blessed Jesus (the <HI>Antitype</HI> of <HI>Joshua</HI>) taking notice of, he doth according to his Soveraign and Irresistible Power and Au|thority Command Deliverances to his Chosen Ones, by Stilling the <HI>Clamour</HI> and Suppressing the <HI>Power</HI> and Malice of SATAN, their <HI>Grand</HI> Adversary and <HI>Implacable</HI> Opposer, as in the Words now before us; <HI>And the LORD said unto SATAN, the LORD Rebuke thee, O SA|TAN,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THESE Words are part of the Prophecy of <HI>Zechariah,</HI> whose Name by Interpre|tation, signifies the <HI>Remembrance</HI> or <HI>Memory of the Lord,</HI> and his <HI>Title</HI> agrees to the very <HI>Na|ture</HI> of this Prophecy; which was to put them in mind, what GOD had done <HI>for</HI> them, in delivering them from <HI>Captivity,</HI> and what they had done <HI>against</HI> him by <HI>Iniquity;</HI> that so they might be awakened unto Reformation of what was amiss. He was the <HI>Second Prophet,</HI> that came from the Lord to the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> after their Return from the Babylonish Cap|tivity. He was Contemporary and Colleague with <HI>Haggai,</HI> beginning to Prophecy but two Months after him, and backing what the o|ther had said, more briefly, with more full and mysterious Testimonies; especially as to the Coming of the Messiah, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He Warns

them of the <HI>Amazing Revolutions,</HI> were coming upon them, in the Destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the <HI>Second Temple</HI> by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and Foretells the <HI>Rejection of the Jews,</HI> for their Sins, and especially, for Rejecting of the MESSIAH, who was to be Porn among them according to the Flesh. The Prophecy con|tains then, <HI>Exhortations</HI> to true Repentance, dispersed throughout the Prophecy: <HI>Predictions</HI> of many Blessings and Mercies to the Faith|ful, relating to the Times of the Gospel, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> The <HI>Coming</HI> of the LORD JESUS, the <HI>Calling</HI> of the Gentiles, and the Protection of his Church to the end of the World, notwithstan|ding all the <HI>Rage</HI> and <HI>Fury</HI> of his and their Enemies; together with severe <HI>Comminations</HI> a|gainst the Enemies of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and against the <HI>Impenitent</HI> among themselves; Intermingling <HI>Encouragements</HI> to <HI>Joshua,</HI> and all Leaders, both in <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Sacred</HI> Order, to be Faithful in the <HI>Discharge</HI> of Duty incumbent on them in all respects as the matter might require. These are the principal matters in the whole Pro|phecy.</P>
<P>In this Chapter, we have an account of <HI>Zechariahs Fourth Vision,</HI> concerning the <HI>Resto|ration</HI> and Establishment of the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> and Temple-Worship; and the <HI>Comforts</HI> Redound|ing to the <HI>Church</HI> from those Administrations;

Typically by <HI>Joshua</HI> the <HI>Brand,</HI> Spiritually and Mystically by JESUS the <HI>Branch.</HI></P>
<P>Particularly, First we have the <HI>Conflict</HI> of the A<HI>ngel</HI> of the Lord, that is <HI>Christ,</HI> against SATAN on behalf of <HI>Joshua,</HI> whom, the <HI>Mischievous</HI> (yet seemingly <HI>zealous) Devil,</HI> (transforming into an <HI>Angel of light</HI>) objected against, and <HI>despised,</HI> by reason of his <HI>filthy garments; verse,</HI> 2, 3.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>SATAN</HI> being rebuked for his ma|lice, the <HI>cause</HI> of his objection is removed, by take|ing away the <HI>filthy garments,</HI> and giveing him <HI>change of raiment; verse</HI> 4. And in order to his <HI>New inauguration,</HI> or Enstailment in the Priest|hood, there is bestowed on him, those ornaments which might Represent him, <HI>full of Splendour,</HI> and fitly qualified for that Office, <HI>verse.</HI> 5.</P>
<P>Upon his Installment, the <HI>Angel of the Lord</HI> gives him a renewed Charge, in a <HI>Solemn Pro|testation</HI> of the Continuance of his Office, and that he would be with him, and assist him in all Administrations, that were according to his own Institution, <HI>verse</HI> 6, 7.</P>

<P>Here then, In the first Verse, We have the Representation of <HI>Joshua</HI> the High-Priest, or <HI>Great Priest,</HI> as the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> who was so by Descent, <HI>a great Officer</HI> in the Church, how|ever mean he was in his Garb, and being a Publick Person, <HI>Represented</HI> the whole Church, And as he C<HI>onducted</HI> the People out of <HI>Ba|bylon,</HI> and <HI>Rebuilt</HI> the Temple, was a <HI>Type of Christ,</HI> both in his <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Office.</HI> (2) We have the <HI>posture</HI> of this <HI>Joshua; standing</HI> be|fore the Angel of the Lord, the Angel of the Covenant, as he is elsewhere called. Now <HI>Joshua</HI> is brought in <HI>Standing</HI> (1) as a <HI>Ser|vant,</HI> to show Inferiority as sitting, denotes Dignity, and Superiority; As a <HI>Servant</HI> de|riving Authority, in his Office; from his Lord; As a <HI>Servant</HI> manifesting all <HI>Readiness,</HI> and <HI>Re|verence</HI> in Obedience. As a <HI>Servant,</HI> to be by his Lord <HI>directed,</HI> as also under his Eye, for <HI>Support</HI> and <HI>Protection.</HI> Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. Standing, as a <HI>guilty Person;</HI> As one <HI>unworthy</HI> to be imployed, in such <HI>Eminent</HI> service; And as a <HI>Publique Person,</HI> had much to <HI>answer</HI> for the sins of the People, as well as his own.</P>
<P N="3">3. Here is the <HI>Opposition Joshua</HI> met with, And SATAN <HI>the Adversary;</HI> whose malice appears,

<P N="4">4. We have the <HI>Posture,</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> of SATAN in <HI>Opposing,</HI> and <HI>accusing</HI> of Joshua; <HI>standing at his Right Hand</HI> the <HI>Right Hand</HI> is the place of the ac|cuser that being.</P>

<P N="1">1. The <HI>Person speaking,</HI> the LORD, that is <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> set forth by a Title of Glorious Soveraignty and Power, the LORD-REDEEM|ER, and Restorer of Mercy, to His Covenant People.

<P>In a word, what was foretold concerning <HI>Ishmael,</HI> is in the most <HI>absolute sense</HI> true of him, Gen. 16. 12 <HI>His Hand is against every Man, and every Mans Hand is</HI> (or should be) <HI>against him.</HI> Such an <HI>Universal</HI> and <HI>Implacable</HI> Adversary and Enemy is this S<HI>atan.</HI> But to Instance briefly in the <HI>Objects</HI> of his Enmity</P>
<P N="1">1. First He is <HI>Gods Enemy.</HI> He sets himself a|gainst the <HI>Infinite</HI> and <HI>Eternal GOD,</HI> All <HI>Satans</HI> designes and Operations; do strike and level, at the very being of <HI>God;</HI> he would dethrone and Un-God him, if it were possible. He <HI>fell</HI> from Gods favour at first, by <HI>rebellion,</HI> and hence by his <HI>righteous Judgement,</HI> was doomed to continue, under the power of <HI>irreconcilable enmity,</HI> against him for ever. He is an Enemy to all the <HI>Divine Attri|butes,</HI> and most glorious <HI>Persons</HI> in all their holy designs and operations. To all the Divine Attri|butes, <HI>Negative, Positive, Relative,</HI> and Endea|vours by Blasphemous denying them to Eclipse the glory of them; he was a lyar <HI>in</HI> and <HI>from</HI> the beginning, against the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Holyness</HI> of GOD; Gen. 3. 1. <HI>Yea hath</HI> GOD <HI>said</HI> &amp;c. He puts them, upon scrupling the truth of the threatning and in the <HI>fourth verse;</HI> down right denies it, <HI>ye shall not surely by</HI> &amp;c. Herein also he reflected upon the <HI>Holyness</HI> of God,
<PB N="12" REF="000643_0026_0FA961D949658C50">
by which he was engaged in that threatning, to advance his own glory; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> The glory of his justice, by punishing mans transgression with Dy|ing <HI>the Death</HI> as is denounced, Gen. 2. 17. <HI>Thou shalt surely dy,</HI> or dy the Death.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Unclean lying satan,</HI> set himself against these <HI>Essential,</HI> and <HI>Inseperable</HI> Attributes, of the <HI>Blessed</HI> God: and in the same manner, doth he <HI>Eclipse</HI> the rest, so far as he is permitted to do it.

Man,</HI> and the more, because he was <HI>Made Flesh,</HI> and shewed such Favour to Mankind, as to <HI>Tabernacle</HI> among them; <HI>John</HI> 1. 14.

<P>Particularly here; First, <HI>He is the Enemy of the SOULS of men.</HI> And indeed, this is that he drives at, in all his <HI>designs,</HI> and <HI>operations,</HI> and to catch devour and destroy SOULS; Hence when he draws <HI>wretched mortals,</HI> to Contract with him; He bargains with them, that after the time of his <HI>service</HI> to them, he will have their Souls, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> Intending to Torment them for ever.</P>
<P>He is a S<HI>pirit,</HI> and hence strikes at the <HI>Spiritual</HI> part the most <HI>Excellent</HI> (Constituent) part of man. Primarily disturbing, and Interrupting, the <HI>Animal</HI> and <HI>Vital</HI> Spirits, he maliciously <HI>O|perates</HI> upon, the more <HI>Common Powers</HI> of the Soul, by strange and frightful <HI>Representations</HI> to the Fancy, or Imagination, and by violent, <HI>Tor|tures</HI> of the body, often threatning to extinguish life; as hath been observed, in those that are afflicted amongst us.

wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him, and be foameth, and gnasheth with his Teeth,</HI> &amp;c, Now although <HI>Actual Possessions,</HI> were most frequent and observable, while our SAVIOUR was on the Earth, and it seems to be so much permitted in that time, that the <HI>Eternal Power</HI> and GODHEAD, of the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> might appear, in the subduing <HI>Satan,</HI> and Sup|pressing his Tyranny, over the <HI>Souls</HI> and <HI>Bo|dies</HI> of the Children of Men: Yet there are certainly some <HI>Lower</HI> Operations of <HI>Satan,</HI> (whereof there are <HI>sundry Examples</HI> among us) which the Bodies of Men and Women, are liable unto.

him, with the utmost degree of <HI>Malignity</HI> and <HI>Loathsomeness,</HI> that natural causes, under the influence of <HI>Diabolical Malice,</HI> could pro|duce; and we may rationally conceive that never any man, had <HI>that Disease</HI> or those <HI>Boiles</HI> (as <HI>Job</HI> had them) who out-lived the Tormenting Pains, and Malignity thereof.

A <HI>Red</HI> Dragon; and he is set forth, pou|ting, out his Malice against her, in a fearful manner, <HI>by a Flood out of his mouth,</HI> verse 15. And here we may note two things.</P>
<P>First, <HI>That the more solemnly, and Person or People are Devoted to God, and thence do shine with Lustre of Holiness, both of Heart and Life, the more vehemently doth he oppose, malign, and Persecute them.</HI> That which makes him so <HI>ma|licious</HI> against the Children of GOD, is his <HI>ac|cursed Contrariety,</HI> to the Image of GOD that is on <HI>them,</HI> and the Principle of Holiness that is <HI>in them.</HI> So that the more <HI>Beauty of Holi|ness,</HI> they hold forth in their Conversation, the more violently, and outragiously doth he <HI>Op|pose</HI> them: A special Instance of this, we have in <HI>Job,</HI> concerning whom the Searcher of Hearts, did (before his afflictions) give this Te|stimony, that <HI>he feared God, and eschewed evil,</HI> Job 1. 8. Upon the notice whereof, <HI>Satan</HI> set him|self against him, to interrupt him <HI>in,</HI> and divert him <HI>from,</HI> that <HI>Sincerity</HI> and <HI>Universallity</HI> of Obe|dience, by obtaining permission to bring <HI>Crosses</HI> and <HI>Afflictions</HI> upon him, in his <HI>Estate</HI> and <HI>Chil|dren chap.</HI> And finding him to be <HI>constant</HI> in his Resolution, to Serve GOD Uprightly, accor|ding to the Testimnoy of GOD himself, <HI>chap.</HI> 2, 3.

his Designs, he did <HI>Transform himself into an An|gel of Light,</HI> as the Apostle saith, <HI>2 Cor.</HI> 11. 14. <HI>(i. e.)</HI> pretend to as much Holiness in outward appearance, as the best; hence when <HI>the Sons of</HI> GOD, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>Angles,</HI> the Eldest Sons of GOD by Creation, came, to <HI>present themselves before the Lord, (i. e.)</HI> to pay their <HI>Homage unto,</HI> and to receive the <HI>Commands</HI> of their Soveraign LORD, <HI>Satan came also among them, Job.</HI> 1. 6.

<P>Secondly, <HI>That the more eminent Service, or Office any person is employed IN, or called to the discharge OF, for the glory of GGD, and the good of his Church, the more violently doth</HI> Satan <HI>resist, with|stand or oppose him.</HI></P>

<P>Secondly <HI>Rebukeing</HI> imports, putting to <HI>shame,</HI> in

sense of <HI>weakness</HI> in argueing, or disputeing; <HI>Jude;</HI> 9.&mdash;<HI>brought not raileing accusation;</HI> but made the <HI>Grand Railer.</HI> ashamed by saying the <HI>LORD Rebuke thee,</HI> or confound thee in thy Ar|gument.</P>
<P><HI>A</HI>nd (Thirdly) it imports <HI>Checking and put|ting to silence.</HI> Luk. 19. 39. <HI>Master Rebuke thy Disciples (i. e.)</HI> put them to silence, Thus it be|longs to the Soveraignty, of the blessed Jehovah, One God in Three Persons with authority to <HI>Re|buke Satan,</HI> to <HI>Shame</HI> him in his accusations, and to <HI>Silence</HI> his clamours, against the servants of God. And that will appear, if we consider three things,</P>
<P>(First) <HI>The Great God the Eternal Jehovah, did at first Create him by his Power,</HI> He made him in a Glorious state of <HI>Happiness,</HI> and perfect|ion of <HI>Holyness,</HI> in the beginning of time; when the innumerable company of Angels were made in and with the highest heavens, <HI>to do his pleasure</HI> Ps. 103. 20. 21. And although, the Apostate Angels, that fell by rebellion <HI>are reserved in Chains</HI> &amp;c. Jude ver. 6. Yet our Saviour tells the De|vil Math. 4. 10. Thou shalt worship the Lord <HI>thy God</HI> &amp;c. Therein not only testifying his own Son like subjection to God his Father, and steadfast, resolution, to exalt his glory, against all manner of temptations, but also thereby, put|ting
<PB N="33" REF="000643_0047_0FA961EEDD912338">
Satan in mind, that even He &amp; all other crea|tures, are bound to worship GOD, their Soveraign <HI>L</HI>ord and Maker and thence that the Devil ought to worship the Lord Jesus who was Truly and Es|sentially God his Creator. For surely he is even the Devils God by Creation, in which he was made a <HI>glorious Angel,</HI> but he made himself by transgression an <HI>horrible</HI> Devil.</P>
<P>(Secondly) The Soveraign Power, of the Great God to rebuke Satan, appears, <HI>In that he doth manage and over-rule, all his motions and Operations, to serve his own most Holy Ends, and to advance his own glory in the winding up.</HI> Angelical natures are ve|ry <HI>active,</HI> and as the <HI>blessed Angels,</HI> are very dili|gent in serving, and glorifying, GOD, and mini|string <HI>for the good of the heirs of salvation,</HI> Hebr. 1. 14. So the <HI>cursed Devils,</HI> are full of subtile con|trivance, malicious designs, and Diabolical opera|tions, for the dishonour of GOD, the ruine of Mankind, and injuring the Heirs of Promise, to the uttermost of their Permission and A|bility.</P>
<P>But what the wise man saith, wisely and truely concerning the <HI>Devices</HI> of man, is every way true of the <HI>Designs</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> Prov: 19: 21. <HI>There are many devices in a mans heart, but the Counsel of the Lord it shall stand, (i. e.)</HI> totally to <HI>defeat</HI> the accomplishment of them,
<PB N="34" REF="000643_0048_0FA961EF6598ADF8">
or to <HI>over-rule</HI> the issues, effects and consequen|ces of them to his own Glory. Thus the GREAT GOD, doth many times out-do <HI>Satans Politicks,</HI> and over-shootes him in his own how, making that which he designed, as meanes to <HI>Prevent</HI> the good of the Church, appear to be a most proper medium to <HI>pro|mote</HI> the benefit thereof, according to his <HI>Blessed will</HI> and Counsel, who can say concerning his own <HI>most Holy</HI> Design; and be as good as his word, in despight of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Divels,</HI> Isa. 46: 10. <HI>My counsel shall stand, And I will do all my pleasure.</HI> This will appear, if we consi|der the <HI>pernicious</HI> designs, and <HI>malicious</HI> methods of <HI>Satan,</HI> in order to the Crucifixion of Our LORD JESUS, and the end he aimed at in his being cut off; and how in a stupendious manner; all was over-ruled, to accomplish <HI>Gods Eternal Purposes,</HI> in the Salvation of this Elect.</P>
<P>(Briefly then, The <HI>Devil finding nothing in him</HI>) (as our Saviour saith, John. 14. 30.) On which to fix any temptation, whereby he might stain him in his Holyness; or pervert him from his Obedience; but was totally overcome, and rou|ted, in a Single conflict, with the <HI>Captaion of our Salvation,</HI> Math: 4: 1, to, 11.

<P><PB N="40" REF="000643_0054_0FA961F842ED2158">
To Explaine this Proposition, we may consider the Arguments used in the Text, to <HI>Re|press</HI> Satan's importunity and <HI>Magnify</HI> God's Mercy, which are Twofold,</P>
<P>First; <HI>God's Free-Love, set on them from Eter|nity, in</HI> that expression, T<HI>he LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Secondly <HI>HIS particular favour, in delivering Joshua and them, from the Babylonish Captivity.</HI> Is not this a Brand pluckt out of the Fire? Of each of these a few words.</P>
<P>First; <HI>God free love from Eternity, placed on his Covenant people.</HI> The Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem &amp;c. <HI>God</HI> at the first, chose the seed of <HI>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,</HI> to be a people to himself, above all the nations of the earth, Psal. 105. 6. And <HI>avouched</HI> them to be <HI>His peculiar people,</HI> Deut. 26. 16. He chose the land of <HI>Judea,</HI> to be the place of their abode, and there he chose the City <HI>Je|rusalem,</HI> or the <HI>vision</HI> of <HI>peace,</HI> as the name signi|fies, in which his people might enjoy <HI>peace</HI> and quietness; after their <HI>travels, toils</HI> and <HI>troubles</HI> in the wilderness, where the <HI>Thrones of Judgment</HI> were established, Psal. 122. 5. Where also the <HI>Temple</HI> was builded, &amp; the <HI>Worship</HI> and <HI>Ordinances</HI> of GOD, Celebrated, and the tokens of Gods presence were placed. So that audience, and acceptance of prayers; might be expected, when offered <HI>towards this City and House,</HI> I Kings 8. 44. Hence by a <HI>Metonymis</HI> of the <HI>City,</HI> put for

the inhabitants, it notes the people of Jerusalem, and by a <HI>Senecdoche</HI> of the part for the whole, implies that whole people which was in Cove|nant with GOD in those days, which did also figuratively represent, the Evangelical Church, the Heavenly Jerusalem, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12. 22. Now Choo|sing is an act of freedom and Liberty in God; and a Testimony of Love and Mercy, to such as are chosen; By which he is inclined to help them in Misery.</P>
<P>Secondly HIS particular favour, in delivering <HI>Joshua</HI> and them, from the Babylonish Captivity <HI>is not this a brand</HI> &amp;c. Where GOD hath begun to shew special favour, he will compleat it, in op|position to <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>Hell.</HI> As he said so the Lords people find it, <HI>God is not a man that he should lye,</HI> Numbers 23. 19. (<HI>i. e.</HI>) as to his <HI>promise,</HI> nor that he should fail in his <HI>Providence,</HI> to car|ry on those works, in which he hath made such blessed beginnings, <HI>is not this a brand pluckt out</HI> &amp;c.

perfect what concerns them, and will not <HI>forsake the works of his own hands, because his mercies endure for ever,</HI> Psal. 138. 8. The force of a gument then, for clearing the Proposition lyes in these two assertions.</P>
<P>First, GOD in choosing <HI>of</HI> and covenanting <HI>with</HI> a Person or People, doth engage all his <HI>Glorious Attributes,</HI> for their good as the mat|ter doth require. When he Declareth he will be their GOD, all his <HI>Sufficiency</HI> and <HI>Efficien|cy,</HI> is for them, (<HI>i. e.</HI>) to the utmost of what he hath Engaged by Covenant: hence his <HI>Ne|gative, Positive,</HI> and <HI>Relative</HI> Attributes, do Recommend his as a proper Object of Faith, for <HI>Present help</HI> to his People in <HI>time of Trouble,</HI> Psal. 46. 1. So that humble <HI>Reminding</HI> him of his Covenant, doth in its own Nature <HI>prevail</HI> with him to exert His <HI>Wisdom, Power, Good|ness, Truth</HI> and <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> &amp;c. in a propor|tionable degree, to <HI>Relieve the Distressed,</HI> as their occasion doth or may require: For <HI>He Remembered his Covenant, and Repented according to the multitude of his Mercies,</HI> Psal. 106.45.</P>
<P>Secondly, Where GOD <HI>hath given some Ex|perience of his</HI> Mercy, <HI>it is to be used as argu|ment to prevail with Him, for what we may fur|ther stand in need of.</HI> Thus in the Text, <HI>Je|shua</HI> is as a brand pluckt out of the Fire, and therefore may <HI>depend</HI> on it, to be Established in the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> and owned accordingly. Thus
<PB N="43" REF="000643_0057_0FA961FA62928660">
then the scope of the Proposition is cleared up, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> When God hath taken a person or people into Covenant, and shewed them spe|cial Favour, <HI>The Gates of Hell</HI> (as our Saviour saith, Mat. 16. 18.) <HI>shall never prevail against them.</HI> Lastly,</P>

<P><HI>The Great GOD, doth manage all his Designs of Mercy to his People, under the Gospel Dispensati|on, in and through the Mediator,</HI> The very <HI>Te|nure</HI> of the Gospel Covenant, is such; and the Termes thereof, are so <HI>Methodized,</HI> as to introduce a necessity of depending on a <HI>Me|diator.</HI> The whole Transaction of the <HI>Gospel Covenant,</HI> betwixt the GREAT GOD, and Fallen Man, is by the <HI>Mediator;</HI> hence it is on better Termes, than the Covenant of Works, H<HI>eb.</HI> 8. 6.

<P>First, JESUS CHRIST <HI>is appointed, according to the method of the Covenant of Grace, to be the Only Mediator betwixt God and Man,</HI> I <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 5. <HI>For there is ONE GOD, and ONE MEDI|ATOR, betwixt GOD and Man, the Man Christ-Jesus.</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="000643_0058_0FA961FB0BD4F228">
And He is, the <HI>Mediator of the New Covenant,</HI> Heb. 12. 24. To his <HI>Mediatorial Of|fice,</HI> is to be referred; His <HI>Intercession</HI> with GOD <HI>the</HI> FATHER, for all Good to his Elect; which he <HI>ever Liveth</HI> to Discharge, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.25. By <HI>Him</HI> our Prayers <HI>Ascend</HI> to GOD, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. 14. By <HI>Him</HI> all Answers of Grace from GOD <HI>Descend</HI> to us. Hence he promiseth, <HI>Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father is my Name, he will give it,</HI> Joh. 16. 23.</P>
<P>Secondly, In the Management of this Of|fice, He is invested with <HI>Kingly Power.</HI> He is a KING for <HI>Dignity,</HI> Psal. 2.6. A KING for <HI>Authority</HI> of Government: KING OF KINGS <HI>and</HI> LORD OF LORDS, <HI>Rev.</HI> 19. 16. <HI>A King for Judgment,</HI> All Judgment is <HI>Committed</HI> unto Him, <HI>John</HI> 5. 22. And it shall finally be <HI>Ma|naged</HI> by him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25. 34. &amp; 41.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>It is one special Administration of</HI> CHRISTS Mediatorial Kingdom, to <HI>Oppose, Suppress,</HI> and <HI>Destroy, the Kingdom and Power of</HI> Satan, <HI>that Grand Enemy of the Souls, and Salvation of men.</HI> Betwixt CHRISTS Kingdom, and <HI>Satans</HI> Kingdom, there is a direct <HI>Con|trariety</HI> and Opposition: Now <HI>Contraries</HI> do mutually endeavour to <HI>Overcome</HI> each other, and bring them to nought.

<P>But I must not conclude this particular, without testifying against some other practises amongst us Condemned by the <HI>Rule</HI> of God, and <HI>writings</HI> of learned and judicious men as yielding to, and tampring <HI>with</HI> the Divel, <ABBR>Viz</ABBR> the <HI>sive</HI> and scys|sers; the Bible and Key; The white of an Egge in a Glass; The horse-shooe nailed on the thresh|old; A stone hung over the Rack in a stable: with many more: which I would not make known to any, that are ignorant of them; be|cause they are no better then <HI>Conjurations,</HI> and if in the use of them <HI>Discoveryes</HI> are made; or Effects produced, to the gratifying their sinful Curiosity in any degree, it must be from the <HI>Devil,</HI> and not from GOD; who never instituted any such ways, by and in which, to discover <HI>secret</HI> things or <HI>future</HI> Events to the Children of Men.

<P>First, there is Comfort for you, in that ye are <HI>the visible Covenant People</HI> of GOD.

<P N="2">2.
