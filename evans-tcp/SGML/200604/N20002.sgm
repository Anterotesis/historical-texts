<HEAD>ON AGRICULTURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE numerous volumes which have al|ready been publi&s;hed on <HI>agriculture,</HI> by authors of the greate&s;t abilities and expe|rience, render it in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a kind of pre&s;umption to attempt making public any further ob&s;ervations and experiments.&mdash;But when I reflect that <HI>agriculture</HI> is not reduced to a regular &s;y&s;tem (e&s;pecially in this coun|try) or arrived at that degree of perfection which other arts, manufactures, and &s;ciences have attained;&mdash;and as it is univer&s;ally ac|knowledged, that every per&s;on who contri|butes, or endeavours to contribute to the

public good, de&s;erves applau&s;e; I tru&s;t that &s;uch ob&s;ervations and improvements as tend to promote the public welfare, will be deem|ed worthy of &s;ome attention.</P>
<P>Activity and inclination, induced me to make practical agriculture and improvements in hu&s;bandry, my amu&s;ement and principal &s;tudy: and having &s;tudied mo&s;t authors in that &s;cience, and their experiments and maxims laid down, enables my proving which are mo&s;t advantageous; and as I entertain the opi|nion that every member of &s;ociety ought to communicate what he has di&s;covered, induces me to publi&s;h the pre&s;ent treati&s;e, which I have endeavoured to write in &s;uch plain language as may &s;uit the meane&s;t capacity. The multi|plicity of improvements that are now making in arts, &s;ciences, mechanics and manufac|tures in this country, &s;hould animate the farmer to be no le&s;s attentive to agriculture; which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and welfare of mankind, in this and every other country.&mdash;The mo&s;t illu&s;trious heroes, philo|&s;ophers and poets among the ancients, &s;tudi|ed to encourage, improve, and even practi|&s;ed agriculture. The mo&s;t noble Roman con&s;uls and dictators, were taken from the plough. The &s;enators of that once flouri&s;hing people, and the mo&s;t learned men of all ages,
<PB N="13" REF="026198_0021_0FD0346247745340">
made agriculture their chief &s;tudy and em|ployment; e&s;teeming it to be the original and genuine &s;ource of the &s;trength, wealth and pro&s;perity of every nation.</P>
<P>The noble and mo&s;t learned and ingenious men of the pre&s;ent age, animated with the public welfare, have conde&s;cended not only to &s;tudy and practi&s;e agriculture, but likewi&s;e to encourage and promote this noble&s;t of arts with indefatigable zeal. It is to &s;uch men of under&s;tanding and liberal &s;entiments, the pub|lic are indebted for the very great improve|ments made in agriculture and all other arts.</P>
<P>Every man who&s;e natural abilities have been cultivated by education, &s;hould certain|ly &s;tudy the improvement of &s;uch arts and &s;ciences, as tend to promote the public wel|fare.</P>
<P>Man was not born merely to eat, drink, &s;leep, or to &s;pend his time in hunting, &s;hoot|ing, gaming, idlene&s;s, di&s;&s;ipation, and &s;en&s;ual gratifications; but to be indu&s;trious and u&s;e|ful to &s;ociety; and ought to leave &s;ome re|cord of his actions as a te&s;timonical of his en|deavours, at lea&s;t to be u&s;eful to the pre&s;ent and future generations.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="026198_0022_0FCF58B042281FC0">Men pur&s;ue different objects as their incli|nations and fancies lead them; but of all the arts, agriculture, when properly conducted, is one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful, profitable, plea&s;ing, rational and healthful amu&s;ements in life.</P>
<P>The agriculturi&s;t, while riding or walking round his farm, fully enjoys the &s;weet refre&s;h|ing breeze, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of his health; and while he attends to his bu|&s;ine&s;s, may entertain him&s;elf with rural &s;ports, every field and experiment pre&s;ent new ob|jects to his view; plea&s;ing re&s;earches into the works of providence: &s;uch as the differ|ent forms and growth of plants and grain: analizing the great diver&s;ity of &s;oils and ma|nures, that he may thereby a&s;certain their properties, and be be&s;t enabled to de&s;troy the particles injurious to vegetation, and enrich the ground.</P>
<P>The practice of hu&s;bandry requires pre|cept, reflection and &s;tudy. Agriculture can|not be benefitted by theory alone; but when theory is united with repeated experiments and facts, agriculture, as all other arts, may be reduced to a regular &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The operation of manures on different &s;oils, may be accounted from their known
<PB N="15" REF="026198_0023_0FD03463D9FA3138">
properties, a&s;certained by repeated experi|ments.</P>
<P>Hence, every agriculturi&s;t ought to &s;tudy and know the qualities of different &s;oils, as well as manures, that they may be properly applied to each other. This &s;cience I deem to be one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful of all human arts: is &s;imilar to a phy&s;ician's knowing the cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;es, the properties of medicines, and their mo&s;t effectual applications.</P>
<P>The practice of agriculture is in general confined, either to per&s;ons who have not had a &s;ufficient education to enable them to keep regular accounts, or who are inattentive and do not choo&s;e to take that trouble; without which, it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the profits and lo&s;s thereon&mdash;hence they cannot po&s;&s;i|bly attain the truth.</P>
<P>The farmer &s;hould be very particular in keeping regular accounts; if he cannot keep the produce of each field &s;eparate, he will find but very little trouble to cut two &s;quare per|ches of the be&s;t, and the &s;ame quantity of the wor&s;t part of his crop, which carried into the barn and thre&s;hed out, will employ but little time; if he will proportion the amount of the perches &s;o cut, to 160, (which
<PB N="16" REF="026198_0024_0FCF58B2015045F0">
an acre contains) the produce per acre of &s;uch field may be ea&s;ily a&s;certained, and &s;hould be immediately minuted in his book; he will be &s;oon convinced of the utility of keeping regular accounts; he will thereby be be&s;t in&s;tructed whether two or three plow|ings or more, if manured with lime, a&s;hes, dung, or compo&s;ts, when applied, with the quantity per acre; the time of &s;owing, and the cour&s;e of crops preceding, are the mo&s;t advantageous.</P>
<P>Should the amount of &s;o &s;mall a quantity as four perches of land be difficult to calcu|late by mea&s;ure, it may be ea&s;ily weighed, and proportioned according to the weight of a bu&s;hel of the &s;ame produce: the&s;e calculati|ons may be expeditiou&s;ly made when the hurry of the day is over, or in wet weather, when other bu&s;ine&s;s does not interfere. By minuting and regi&s;tering &s;uch accounts in a regular manner, they can be referred to at any future period: the agriculturali&s;t will thereby be enabled to avoid the wrong, and to pur&s;ue the be&s;t and mo&s;t advantageous method. Such a plan will &s;oon become ha|bitual, amu&s;ing, in&s;tructive and profitable.</P>
<P>Enabled from my own experience, the re|gular accounts I have kept of each &s;eparate
<PB N="17" REF="026198_0025_0FD03465C725AA88">
field, and ob&s;ervations made on the mode of other farmers cultivation; I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that many real lo&s;&s;es are &s;u&s;tained by improper management: &s;uch for in&s;tance, not plowing &s;o deep as the nature of the &s;oil will admit, or not allowing a &s;ufficient num|ber of plowings and harrowings to pulverize and clear the land of weeds; the application of raw dung, unmixed with earth immedi|ately for the crop, harbouring and nouri&s;hing in&s;ects and weeds, which greatly injure and often de&s;troy the crops of grain, not introdu|cing a meliorating, but an improper &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of impoveri&s;hing crops.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t authors on agriculture have been too complex and ambiguous; but the accounts of my experiments in this treati&s;e, will &s;uffici|ently elucidate the forms I have made u&s;e of, which I deem to be the mo&s;t &s;imple, ea&s;y, and be&s;t adapted to the meane&s;t capacity.</P>
<P>Farmers may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great natural abilities, and knowledge in the common mode of their ance&s;tors; but every farmer is not a &s;cholar, mechanic, chemi&s;t, or philo|&s;opher. Their knowledge, and the methods they pur&s;ue in general, extend no further than that of their predece&s;&s;ors, or the cu&s;tom of the country where they re&s;ide. Any di&s;|coveries

made by them are re&s;erved to them|&s;elves, and them&s;elves only benefited by it; but men of ingenious and liberal di&s;po&s;itions, no &s;ooner make di&s;coveries, than they are communicated to the public.</P>
<P>Experiments can be of little u&s;e when ex|tended no further than for our own private in&s;truction; and rea&s;oning without experi|ments avail but little in the practical arts; theory without practice, is &s;imilar to a &s;ha|dow without &s;ub&s;tance; but when rea&s;oning is founded on &s;cience combined with experi|ments minutely attended to, it is from thence only the ingenious arti&s;t or agriculturi&s;t is en|abled to draw &s;uch conclu&s;ions as are of real utility.</P>
<P>The great and general ambition of farm|ers is to occupy large farms; the more they po&s;&s;e&s;s, the greater con&s;equence they think them&s;elves of; but one acre of land, properly managed, will produce more than four, by improper cultivation.</P>
<P>Were farmers to occupy no more ground than they could cultivate in a ma&s;terly man|ner, there would not be that general com|plaint of &s;canty crops, or of the land being worn out; for there is no land of any &s;ort
<PB N="19" REF="026198_0027_0FD0346D0592D970">
whatever, (which has a &s;ufficient depth of mould for plowing) but what may be ren|dered fertile by prudent cultivation, and the application of proper manures; and in proportion to their different degrees of na|tural richne&s;s, be managed in &s;uch manner as to produce luxuriant and profitable crops of &s;ome &s;pecies of vegetables: and that by bad conduct good &s;oils oftentimes produce but very &s;canty crops; when the blame is too fre|quently imputed to their natural poverty. Hence, for in&s;tance, in the brewing of beer, or the baking of bread, the materials may be of the very be&s;t quality, yet, from the want of care and proper management, both are &s;poiled, or greatly injured; &s;o it is with land.</P>
<P>The wearing out of land is occa&s;ioned by a continual cropping, taking off the crops, and giving it no return or re&s;t, which &s;hould be given by &s;owing in rotation &s;uculent gra&s;|&s;es or pul&s;e&mdash;&s;uch as clover, timothy, lu|cern, &s;aintfoin, trefoil, tears, vetches, peas and beans, to recover that etherial &s;pirit of the world, which is lo&s;t by improper manage|ment.</P>
<P>For this globe of the earth that affords unto us the &s;ub&s;tance not only of our&s;elves,

The &s;pirit is that which ince&s;&s;antly admini&s;ters to every animal its generation, life, growth and motion; to every vegetable its original and vegetation. It is a vehicle that carries with it the &s;ulphu|rious and &s;aline parts, whereof the matter, &s;ub&s;tance, or body of all vegetables and ani|mals are formed and compo&s;ed.&mdash;It is the operator or workman that tran&s;mutes by its active heat, the &s;ulphurious and &s;aline parts of the earth or water into that variety of objects we daily behold or enjoy.

<P>Providence mo&s;t wonderfully a&s;&s;i&s;ts the indu&s;try of man, by cele&s;tial and atmo&s;|pherical influences, which greatly tend to enrich the earth, and to promote vegetation.</P>
<P>As the qualities of all &s;oils vary con&s;idera|bly, every agriculturi&s;t ought to make him|&s;elf well acquainted with the nature of his land, as al&s;o the property of manures; a ju|dicious

<P>After you have burnt up your eight loads of dry clay, the heat which is within, will be &s;o great, as that it will fire any thing, and then you may lay on the clay green as it is dug out of the pit, being always watchful to keep a new addition of it; laying on one af|ter another; but not too fa&s;t, lea&s;t you &s;mo|ther the fire, and put it out: this you may enlarge and &s;pread out at the feet, as the heap &s;wells; and if occa&s;ion be, there may be &s;tages of boards laid, on which the men may &s;tand who place the &s;pits of clay.

<P>As the learned and ingenious Dr. Hunter, of York, in Great-Britain, fir&s;t made tho&s;e im|portant and intere&s;ting di&s;coveries, relative to the putrid and noxious particles of the air being con&s;umed by the vegetable creation, and which were publi&s;hed in the year 1769, and 1770, I will beg leave to pre&s;ent the rea|der with &s;uch extracts as are nece&s;&s;ary for my pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"It is plea&s;ing to ob&s;erve how the di&s;&s;olu|tion of one body is nece&s;&s;ary for the life and increa&s;e of another. All nature is in moti|on. In con&s;equence of the putrid fermenta|tion

which is every where carried on, a quantity of vegetable nutriment a&s;cends into the atmo&s;phere&mdash;&s;ummer &s;howers return much of it again; but part falls into the &s;ea and is lo&s;t: to this we may add the animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances con&s;umed on board of &s;hips, all of which are buried in the ocean. The indu&s;try of man re&s;tores them to the earth; and we may pre&s;ume that the fi&s;h ta|ken out of the &s;ea, leaves a ballance in favour of mankind. Thus Providence with the mo&s;t con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, keeps up the nece&s;&s;ary rotation of things."</P>
<P>"Hitherto I have con&s;idered plants as nou|ri&s;hed by their roots. I &s;hall now take a view of them as nouri&s;hed by their leaves. An at|tention to this part of the vegetable &s;y&s;tem, is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the rational farmer. Vegetables that have a &s;ucculent leaf, &s;uch as vetches, peas, beans, and buckwheat, draw a great part of their nouri&s;hment from the air, and on that account, impoveri&s;h the &s;oil le&s;s than wheat, cats, barley or rye, the leaves of which are of a firmer texture. Rape and hemp are oil-bearing plants, con&s;equently im|poveri&s;hers of the &s;oils; but the former le&s;s &s;o than the latter, owing to the great &s;ucculen|cy of its leaf. The leaves of all kinds of grain are &s;ucculent for a time; during which period
<PB N="71" REF="026198_0079_0FD034E6DCE11CB8">
the plants take little from the earth; but as &s;oon as the ear begins to be formed, they lo&s;e their &s;oftne&s;s, and dimini&s;h in their at|tractive power. The radical fibres are then more vigorou&s;ly employed in extracting the oily particles of the earth, for the nouri&s;hment of the &s;eed. Such I apprehend is the cour&s;e of nature."</P>
<P>"In order that we may have a di&s;tinct view of the motion of the &s;ap, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to reflect that the root, &s;tem, branches and leaves are con&s;tructed in the &s;ame man|ner. Sallows, willows, vines, and mo&s;t &s;hrubs, will grow in an inverted &s;tate, with their tops downwards in the earth. Dr. Bradly de&s;cribes the manner of inverting a young cherry tree, the roots of which will put forth leaves, and the branches become roots. Hence it is obvious that the nutritive matter may be conveyed as well by the leaves as the roots, their va&s;cular &s;tructure being the very &s;ame.</P>
<P>"Air is to be found in every portion of earth: and as it always contains a &s;olution of the volatile parts of animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, we &s;hould be careful to keep our &s;tiff &s;oils as open as po&s;&s;ible to its influence. It pa&s;&s;es both in its active and fixed &s;tate,

into the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the root, and mixing with the juices of the plant, circu|lates through every part. Dr. Hales, in his &s;tatical experiments on the vine, di&s;covered it a&s;cending with the &s;ap in the bleeding &s;ea|&s;on."</P>
<P>In the year 1773, the ingenious and inde|fatigable Dr. Prie&s;tly, pre&s;ented to the royal &s;ociety, his experiments on the different kinds of air, which clearly proves that putrid air ari&s;ing from dunghills, and that the per|&s;piration of animals, are not only ab&s;orbed by vegetables, but al&s;o add to their increa&s;e. As tho&s;e experiments are of too intere&s;ting a nature to be pa&s;&s;ed over unnoticed, for the benefit of tho&s;e who have not had an oppor|tunity of &s;eeing the original, I &s;hall here tran&s;cribe part, referring the curious to the learned Doctor's publication.</P>
<P>"When air has been fre&s;hly and &s;trongly tainted with putrefaction, &s;o as to &s;mell thro' the water, &s;priggs of mint have pre&s;ently di|ed, upon being put into it, their leaves turn|ing black; but if they do not die pre&s;ently, they thrive in a mo&s;t &s;urprizing manner.</P>
<P>"In no other circum&s;tances have I ever &s;een vegetation &s;o vigourous as in this kind of
<PB N="73" REF="026198_0081_0FD034EA36C78388">
air, which is immediately fatal to animal life. Though the&s;e plants have been croud|ed in jars filled with this air, every leaf has been full of life; fre&s;h &s;hoots have branched out in various directions, and have grown much fa&s;ter than other &s;imilar plants, grow|ing in the &s;ame expo&s;ure in common air. This ob&s;ervation led me to conclude, that plants in&s;tead of affecting the air in the &s;ame manner with animal re&s;piration, rever&s;e the effects of breathing, and tend to keep the atmo&s;phere &s;weet and whole&s;ome, when it is become noxious, in con&s;equence of animals either living and breathing, or dying and pu|trefying in it.</P>
<P>"In order to a&s;certain this, I took a quan|tity of air, made thoroughly noxious by mice breathing and dying in it, and divided it into two parts; one of which I put into a phial immer&s;ed in water; and to the other (which was contained in a gla&s;s jar &s;tanding in wa|ter) I put a &s;prig of mint. This was about the beginning of Augu&s;t, 1771, and after eight or nine days, I found that a mou&s;e liv|ed perfectly well in that part of the air, in which the &s;prig of mint had grown, but died, the moment it was put into the other part of the &s;ame original quantity of air, and which I had kept in the very &s;ame expo&s;ure, but

<HEAD>On the <HI>IMPROVEMENT</HI> of <HI>WET LANDS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t and principal improvement of wet land is draining, without which, the greate&s;t quantity of the be&s;t manure will prove inef|fectual. Coar&s;e gra&s;s, ru&s;hes, hor&s;e-mints, and other noxious weeds, are the general productions of lands overcharged with moi|&s;ture, proceeding from the water being re|tained by a &s;tiff impervious clay, or from cold hungry &s;prings, which are frequently loaded with minerals and acids; and from want of proper drains, the &s;tagnated waters corrupt the natural nouri&s;hment, &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;|&s;ary for producing &s;weet herbage; but when the cau&s;e is removed, the effects will cea&s;e. Tho&s;e luxurious, noxious weeds being de|prived of their nouri&s;hment, of cour&s;e die, and &s;weet whole&s;ome herbage naturally &s;uc|ceed, without manure.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="026198_0083_0FD034F771496E80">The greate&s;t attention &s;hould be paid to the &s;ituation and declivity of the ground; the ditches at the lowe&s;t part of the land &s;hould be fir&s;t opened of a &s;ufficient depth and &s;ize, (according to the nature of the &s;oil) at lea&s;t three feet perpendicularly deep, two feet wide at the bottom, and four feet wide at the top, gradually increa&s;ing from the bot|tom to the &s;urface; which &s;lope will prevent the &s;ides from falling in with rain or fro&s;ts. The mould thrown from this ditch or drain will make a bank on one &s;ide, on the top, a dwarf hedge may be made with &s;ome bru&s;h-wood at a very trifling expence, that will be &s;uperior to a po&s;t and rail fence&mdash;lands by that means may be put into &s;mall lots, which will be of great advantage to the farmer. Di|rections for making the hedge, I &s;hall give hereafter&mdash;&s;ee hedging.</P>
<P>Small or leading drains &s;hould be made (according to their declivity) from twenty to twenty four inches deep, nine inches wide at bottom, and from fifteen to eighteen inches broad on the &s;urface; extending through the mo&s;t hollow, and from the lowe&s;t to the high|e&s;t parts of the land. The&s;e branches or &s;mall|er drains &s;hould be from twenty to forty or fif|ty feet apart (in proportion to the &s;prings and wetne&s;s of the &s;oil) cut acro&s;s the ground, with
<PB N="76" REF="026198_0084_0FD034FA37B52F48">
a hanging level, &s;ufficient to convey the water into the large drains.</P>
<P>If &s;tones can be conveniently got, they are the mo&s;t effectual for this purpo&s;e: when the work is properly executed it will la&s;t for ever. The be&s;t method I have experienced is, to place flat &s;tones &s;tanding on the bottom as perpendicular as the &s;ides of the drains will admit, with other flat &s;tones on the oppo|&s;ite &s;ide, placed with the top part to re&s;t again&s;t the upright &s;tones, in the form of
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
&s;hould this cavity be in&s;ufficient for the current of water, another flat &s;tone may be placed in a rever&s;ed form, as
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
by which there will be a double vacuum, fully &s;ufficient for the greate&s;t current; the remainder of the drains, when in arable lands, may be filled up with &s;tones, to within about eight inches of the &s;urface, covered with &s;traw or &s;talks of any &s;ort, to prevent the earth from falling between the &s;tones, and filled up with the mould that came out of the drain; the remainder may be &s;cattered over the land.</P>
<P>In draining pa&s;ture lands, the turf is care|fully laid a&s;ide, the drains filled with &s;tones to within four or five inches of the &s;urface; and the gra&s;s part of the turf is placed there|on,
<PB N="77" REF="026198_0085_0FD034FB1E33EB18">
which &s;aves the trouble of laying &s;traw, and as effectually prevents the earth from fal|ling between the &s;tones into the drains.</P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>CLEARING LAND</HI> from <HI>TREES, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The next improvement is, the clearing of lands from the &s;tumps and roots of trees, grubbs, thorns, briers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>When lands are encumbered by any of tho&s;e before mentioned, it is impo&s;&s;ible to plow land as it ought to be&mdash;when land is only &s;cratched, and the&s;e rubbi&s;h receiving part of the nutritive food, good crops can|not be expected.</P>
<P>Timber and pollard trees are injurious to arable and pa&s;ture grounds; they ob&s;truct the free circulation of the air and the effects of the &s;un. The leaves, particularly of a&s;h, render the gra&s;s, whereon they fall, coar&s;e and &s;our; which, when eaten by cows, affect their milk with a &s;trong di&s;agreeable ta&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="026198_0086_0FCF58DB09FC7CF0">Trees attract, and their &s;hade and roots retain moi&s;ture and acidity in the &s;oil; their wide extended fibrous roots, particularly of a&s;h and hickory &s;trike horizontally, near the &s;urface, to a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance; they greatly impoveri&s;h pa&s;ture grounds, and im|pede the plow in arable land.</P>
<P>The roots of trees grow in proportion to their trunks and branches; therefore, no more than two or three &s;hould be left in a field for cattle to rub again&s;t, and for &s;hade.</P>
<P>When trees are planted, or permitted to re|main for timber or for firing, the northern and ea&s;tern &s;ides of fields, and irregular corners, are the mo&s;t proper &s;ituations; where they afford &s;helter, and &s;erve as a &s;creen again&s;t cold winds, and do not ob&s;truct the influences of the &s;un and air.</P>
<P>When lands are cleared from &s;uperfluous trees, &amp;c. attention &s;hould be paid to the &s;ur|face and condition of the ground&mdash;where ants inhabit, their hills &s;hould be pared off as before directed, carried to the middle of the field, and there mixed with the a&s;hes made from the rubbi&s;h wood, &amp;c. and lime, when

<PB N="80" REF="026198_0088_0FD0350089E39DC0">
give a de&s;cripion of the different ploughs u&s;ed in &s;everal counties in England.</P>
<P>The plough mo&s;t u&s;ed in Middle&s;ex, Hert|ford, Berk&s;hire, Bedford&s;hire, &amp;c. is the two wheeled plough&mdash;as I have not &s;een one of them in this country, I &s;hall give a de&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>The two principal parts of this plough, are the head and the tail; the plough head contains the two wheels and their axis, or &s;pindle pa&s;&s;|ing through a box, and turning round in it, and in the wheels; there are fixed perpendi|cularly in this box two crow &s;taves, as they are called, which are flat and narrow boards, each having on it two rows of holes, whereby to rai&s;e or &s;ink the beam of the plough, by pinning up or down the pillow, to increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the depth of the furrow.</P>
<P>Behind are a pair of gallows, through which the crow-&s;taves pa&s;s at the top by mor|ti&s;es, into which they are pinned, and to the&s;e are fa&s;tened what they call the wilds, which are rings and crooks of iron by which the whole plough is drawn in the working.</P>
<P>From the box to the centre of the beam, there is carried an iron chain, con&s;i&s;ting of
<PB N="81" REF="026198_0089_0FCF58DD2B0D4938">
four, five or more long links, and called the tow-chain: this fa&s;tens the plough-tail to the plough-head.</P>
<P>It is fixed to an iron collar, fa&s;tened in the beam at one end, and at the other pa&s;&s;es through a hole in the middle of the box, and is pinned in with a wooden pin.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame iron collar to which the tow-chain is fixed, there is al&s;o another chain fa&s;tened, called the bridle-chain: this runs above the beam, as the tow-chain does below it, and is compo&s;ed of &s;maller and more numerous links.</P>
<P>At the upper end, as the tow-chain enters the box of the plough there is a perpendicular &s;tick, carried up parallel with the left crow-&s;taff, and pretty near it, and fa&s;tened to it by a withe, or rope, or by the end of the bridle-chain it&s;elf, when that is long enough. This &s;take is al&s;o fa&s;tened in its lower part, under the gallows, to the &s;ame crow-&s;taff, by another withe or piece of rope.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e are the parts of which the head part of the plough is compo&s;ed. The plough-tail con&s;i&s;ts of the beam carried from the
<PB N="82" REF="026198_0090_0FD035075971A818">
head to the very extremity, and &s;erving as the &s;upport and ba&s;e of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>A little below the collar to which the tow-chain and bridle-chain are fa&s;tened, this beam is pierced with a large hole, which lets through the coulter: this is long and nar|row, terminating in an edge, and reaching ju&s;t to the &s;hare; and it is fixed immovea|ble in its place by a wedge, which is driven into the hole of the beam with it: the of|fice of this coulter is to cut the earth as it is thrown up by the &s;hare.</P>
<P>Behind the&s;e, the &s;ame beam is pierced with two more holes, one very near its end: the&s;e give pa&s;&s;age to two ablong pieces, called the fore-&s;heat and hinder-&s;heat, by which the plough-&s;hare is &s;upported in its place.</P>
<P>To the top of the hinder-&s;heat there is fa|&s;tened a &s;hort handle by a wooden pin.</P>
<P>Parallel to the hinder-&s;heat, there runs up a piece of wood of much the &s;ame form, called the drock; and to this is fa&s;tened another horizontal piece, called the ground-wri&s;t; the&s;e are all on the right hand &s;ide of the plough, and parallel with the fore-&s;heat.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="026198_0091_0FCF58DE00B5EA50">There runs another piece of much the &s;ame form with it, on the right hand; and the bottom of this is the earth-board. The long handle of this, which reaches as far as that of the &s;heat, is fa&s;tened to the drock, by a pin, the other end of which goes into the beam.</P>
<P>Near the lower end of the fore-&s;heat, there are two flat pieces of iron, which pa&s;s from the two &s;ides of it up to the beam; and be|ing let through, are fa&s;tened to the upper part by &s;crews and pins.&mdash;The&s;e keep the &s;heat in its place.</P>
<P>The &s;tructure of the four-coultered plough, is different, in &s;ome re&s;pects to this, though in general founded on it. Its beam is ten feet long, whereas that of the common plough is but eight. The beam is &s;traight in the common plough; but in this it is arched in one fourth part of its length, near the plough-head.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of three feet four inches from the end of the beam at the plough-tail, the fir&s;t coulter, or that next the &s;hare, is let through; and at thirteen inches from this, a &s;econd coulter is let through; a third at the &s;ame di&s;tance from that; and finally,
<PB N="84" REF="026198_0092_0FD03516EB7CD3E8">
the fourth at the &s;ame di&s;tance from the third, that is thirteen inches.</P>
<P>The crookedne&s;s of the upper part of the beam in this plough is contrived to avoid the two great length of the three foremo&s;t coul|ters, which would be too much, if the beam was &s;traight all the way; and they would be apt to bend and be di&s;placed, unle&s;s they were va&s;tly heavy and clum&s;y. A&s;h is the be&s;t wood to make the beam of, it being &s;uffici|ently &s;trong and yet light.</P>
<P>The &s;heat in this plough is to be &s;even inch|es broad. The fixing of the &s;hare in this, as well as in the common plough, is the nice&s;t part, and requires the utmo&s;t art of the ma|ker; for the well going of the plough wholly depends upon the placing this. Suppo&s;ing the axis of the beam, and the left &s;ide of the &s;hare, to be horizontal, they mu&s;t never be &s;et paral|lel to each other; for if they are, the tail of the &s;hare, bearing again&s;t the trench as much as the point, would cau&s;e the point to incline to the right hand, and it would be carried out of the ground into the furrow.</P>
<P>If the point of the &s;hare &s;hould be &s;et &s;o, that its &s;ide &s;hould make an angle on the right &s;ide of the axis of the beam, this incon|venience
<PB N="85" REF="026198_0093_0FD03519ED206DE0">
would be much greater; and if its point &s;hould incline much to the left, and make too large an angle on that &s;ide with the axis of the beam, the plough would run quite to the left hand; and, if the holder, to pre|vent its running quite out of the ground, turns the upper part of this plough toward the left hand, the pin of the &s;hare will ri&s;e up and cut the furrow diagonally, leaving it half unplowed.</P>
<P>To avoid this, and &s;everal inconveniences, the &s;traight &s;ide of the &s;hare mu&s;t make an angle upon the left &s;ide of the beam; but that mu&s;t be &s;o very acute a one, that the tail of the &s;hare may only pre&s;s again&s;t the &s;ide of the trench than the point does.</P>
<P>The great thing to be taken care of, is the placing the four coulters: for on this the &s;ucce&s;s of the whole depends. The&s;e mu&s;t be &s;o &s;et that the four planes, as the plough moves forward, may be all parallel to each other, or very nearly &s;o; for if any one of them &s;hould be very much inclined to, or &s;hould recede much from either of the other, then they would not enter the ground toge|ther.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="026198_0094_0FD0351A9CD5B6C0">In order to the placing them thus, the beam mu&s;t be carefully pierced in a proper manner. The &s;econd coulter-hole mu&s;t be two inches and an half more on the right hand than the fir&s;t: the third mu&s;t be as much to the right of the &s;econd; and the fourth the &s;ame mea&s;ure to the right hand of the third: and this two inches and an half mu&s;t be care|fully mea&s;ured from the centre of one hole to the centre of the other. Each of the&s;e holes is a morti&s;e of an inch and quarter wide, and is three inches and an half long at the top, and three inches at the bottom. The two oppo&s;ite &s;ides of this hole are paral|lel to the top and bottom, but the back is oblique, and determines the obliquity of the &s;tanding of the coulter, which is wedged tight up to the poll.</P>
<P>The coulter is two feet eight inches long, before it is worn; the handle takes up &s;ixteen inches of this length, and is allowed thus long that the coulter may be driven down as the point wears away.</P>
<P>The &s;ingle wheel plough u&s;ed in E&s;&s;ex, Suf|folk, Norfolk, &amp;c. is a fine light plough cal|culated for two hor&s;es. The wheel is fixed to the beam by a piece of iron with holes in it, whereby it may be &s;et near or off, deep and
<PB N="87" REF="026198_0095_0FCF58E337DC1838">
&s;hallow. It has an iron earth-board made rounding, which turns the turf better than any other plough.</P>
<P>The &s;ingle wheel plough u&s;ed in Surry, Kent, Su&s;&s;ex, Hamp&s;hire, &amp;c. is a clum&s;y heavy plough, very wide in the breech, con|&s;equently the draught of it mu&s;t be very hard.</P>
<P>The &s;wing plough u&s;ed in Worce&s;ter&s;hire, Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, Warwick&s;hire, Northamp|ton&s;hire, &amp;c. is much the &s;ame as that u&s;ed in this country.</P>
<P>The hoe ploughs are two, one of them is that u&s;ed in E&s;&s;ex, &amp;c. only light, as it is often worked with one hor&s;e, to plow be|tween the rows of grain.&mdash;This is to go one bought, taking the mould away next the roots of the grain and throwing it up in a ridge in the middle of the alley.</P>
<P>The other plough has a &s;hare with a &s;in on each &s;ide; it has two earth-boards, they are equal on both &s;ides, and made to let out to any weadth, or contracted in:&mdash;This plough is for going right in the middle of the alley between the grain, which throws up the mould equally up to the grain on both &s;ides,
<PB N="88" REF="026198_0096_0FD0351C1CD7A2F0">
and does as much work in half a bought as the other does in a whole one.</P>
<P>It is evident that earth often digged, and &s;kreened in a garden, produces the be&s;t til|lage; &s;o is it the principal rea&s;on that plow|ing and harrowing of land makes it the mo&s;t fruitful; for by this means the &s;pirit of the earth, or the Sal. Terroe is collected, as al&s;o that of the air, dews, and rain; when &s;everal vegetable &s;alts are put into a condition to act, by the finene&s;s of the earth, which are the life and nouri&s;hment of all things that grow therein; and for the want of the&s;e two qua|lifications, many crops have been lo&s;t. So that upon the due knowledge of plowing and the right practice thereof, depends chiefly the right benefit of farming. A light earth is ca|pacitated to receive the nitrous dews and ce|le&s;tial influences, which coagulate and fix on the &s;ame; when a heavy &s;our earth mi&s;&s;es, and goes without the benefit.</P>
<P>And therefore I &s;hall endeavour to &s;upply in &s;ome mea&s;ure, I believe I may &s;ay, what mo&s;t authors have been hitherto chiefly wan|ting in; and the chief rea&s;on for their omi&s;|&s;ion, I pre&s;ume, is, their not being acquainted with the practical part of plowing, although
<PB N="89" REF="026198_0097_0FD0351E63B99588">
it is certainly the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary branch of farming.</P>
<P>When the &s;oil has been well loo&s;ened by deep repeated plowings and harrowings, its particles are minutely divided, and the roots of plants have liberty to &s;pread freely. Hence are enabled to acquire &s;uch nouri&s;hment, as could not po&s;&s;ible be obtained when con|fined between large impenetrable clods of earth.</P>
<P>Strong clayey ground cannot be too often plowed, and expo&s;ed to the &s;un aad fro&s;t. Gravels, &s;ands, and &s;uch light grounds, are much &s;ooner brought into a tilth; therefore le&s;s plowings will do. All grounds &s;hould be plowed as deep as the &s;taple will allow: therefore the two hor&s;e farmers &s;eldom cul|tivate the land as it &s;hould be, becau&s;e their &s;trength renders them uncapable of doing this work to the purpo&s;e, &s;o that the roots of large weeds are left, which &s;hoot up with the grain and gra&s;s, whereby is the occa&s;ion of great part of the crop being lo&s;t; for if only a poke root will &s;et four hor&s;es, what chance has a pair with &s;trong roots? It is therefore a farmer's intere&s;t to keep a hor&s;e extraordi|nary.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="026198_0098_0FD03311D2153A08">When land is plowed well, and the weeds killed, then is there greater room for manures and dre&s;&s;ings, which in weedy grounds help to multiply and enlarge their product, and often is the cau&s;e of &s;uch weeds &s;poiling the crop.</P>

<HEAD>PLOWING OF FALLOWS, OR FALLOWING,</HEAD>
<P>Is preparing the land by plowing and ma|nuring, recovering that &s;pirit lo&s;t in tillage; or &s;weetening, and de&s;troying tho&s;e particles hurtful to vegetation. Experience enables me to &s;ay, that &s;ummer fallows are unne|ce&s;&s;ary on lands that can be brought into pro|per tillage for fallow crops.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t attentive ob&s;ervations and expe|riments, have in&s;tructed me, that when pa|&s;tures are intended to be broken up, the lat|ter part of September, or beginning of Octo|ber, is the mo&s;t advantageous &s;ea&s;on. At that time vegetation begins to decline, con&s;e|quently the produce of the land is but of lit|tle value, till the &s;ucceeding &s;pring.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="026198_0099_0FD03312DA77ECB8">The ground, as &s;oon as broken up, &s;hould be rolled with a heavy roller; the &s;ward by that means, will be &s;o clo&s;ed that the heat and moi&s;ture will cau&s;e a &s;peedy fermentation, and rot the &s;ward more in October and No|vember, than it would in the four following months. It &s;hould be harrowed, that the earth may be loo&s;ened, and prepared to re|ceive the benefits of the air, rain, and fro&s;t.</P>
<P>The latter end of November, or the begin|ning of December, it &s;hould be obliquely plowed as deep as the &s;taple will admit. By this mode, the baulks that were made at the fir&s;t plowing will be corrected.</P>
<P>The land being thus left in its rough &s;tate, will be expo&s;ed to the winter fro&s;t, which will penetrate the hard clods, and by its expan|&s;ive force, greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t in pulverizing the &s;oil.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the weather will permit in the &s;pring, it mu&s;t be well worked with heavy harrows, by which the clods will be greatly, if not totally reduced; and by being thus divided, will receive farther benefit from the influences of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="026198_0100_0FD03315E5022EA0">In the month of March, or April, accord|ing to the &s;ea&s;on or climate, the land &s;hould be again rolled, to break the remaining clods; which being pre&s;&s;ed into the ground, mu&s;t be loo&s;ened and pulverized by harrow|ing. In this &s;tate the earth &s;hould remain for &s;ix or &s;even days, to receive further be|nefit from the atmo&s;phere. Then plow for the crop.</P>
<P>After the land has been prepared in this manner, I have &s;own peas in drills at four feet di&s;tance&mdash;have given them two plow|ings with the hoe-ploughs, the produce per acre was &s;eventy-five bu&s;hels, which I &s;old for 5s. 6d. &s;terling.

<P>This method of cultivation fully proves the great advantage of good tillage. The ad|vantages ari&s;ing from drilling in of grain are great, compared to the broad ca&s;t.&mdash;By the drill, the &s;eed is depo&s;ited at &s;uch a certain re|guired regular di&s;tance and depth in the ground, as to meet with moi&s;ture. Every &s;eed will &s;oon vegetate, and even in the drie&s;t &s;ea|&s;on will produce one extraordinary crop, from five to twenty bu&s;hels per acre, more than by the common mode. The &s;eed, by drilling is al&s;o &s;ecured from birds. The intervals ad|mit being hoed and cleaned from weeds, while the ground is preparing for a &s;ucceed|ing crop, be&s;ides by hoeing, the ground is &s;o pulverized as readily to imbibe the dews and rains, keeps the pores open, &s;o that in the dri|e&s;t &s;ea&s;ons plants are kept in a moi&s;t &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD>FALLOWING OF LAND THAT IS UNDER TILLAGE.</HEAD>
<P>In order to illu&s;trate the &s;uperior advanta|ges accruing from good management, tho|rough
<PB N="94" REF="026198_0102_0FCF585ACA3DDF38">
tillage, and changing of crops, to improper management, and the erroneous &s;avings of labour and expence, I &s;hall revert to other of my experiments to prove the mo&s;t beneficial method of culture.</P>
<P>After a field had produced its regular ro|tation of crops, I fallow plowed it, that is, as &s;oon as harve&s;t was done, I plowed in the &s;tubble and layed it up in one bout ridges, and let it lay in that rough &s;tate, till the fol|lowing &s;pring; as &s;oon as the weather would permit, gave it a good harrowing, which made the &s;eeds of the weeds vegetate. In May obliquely plowed it; the latter end of June, gave it another good harrowing, then hauled on the manure, and &s;pread it and plowed it in, and &s;owed turnip-&s;eed, broad ca&s;t, every day what was plowed.</P>
<P>The &s;eed was &s;teeped in fi&s;h oil for twelve hours, which hinders the fly from hurting the plant, (In New-England, the beginning of July is the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for &s;owing; in the middle &s;tates, about the middle of the month; and to the &s;outhward, the latter end.)</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the plants were pretty large, before they bottled, I had them hoed, all the &s;upurfluous ones cut up, and left at
<PB N="95" REF="026198_0103_0FCF5869584B0A38">
about fifteen inches apart. In October I gave them another hoeing: the two hoeings co&s;t me 10s. per acre. The latter part of November they were at their full growth, &s;o large, that they covered partly all the ground.</P>
<P>This field contained ten acres, which I penned, and fed off with &s;heep. I bought fifty weathers for 45l. and thirty ewes, with lamb, for 18l. The turnips were &s;ufficient for fattening the weathers, and cupples, ex|clu&s;ive of feeding &s;ixty &s;tore &s;heep, that fol|lowed tho&s;e that were fattening, and eat up their leavings. The weathers I &s;old to the butcher for 112l. 10s. and the cupples for 57l. and the feed of the &s;tore &s;heep, I reckoned to be worth 9l. &s;o that the profit of this fallow crop was 110l. 10s. which is 11l. 1s. per acre, exclu&s;ive of a good dre&s;&s;ing from their ma|nure, for a &s;ucceeding crop.</P>
<P>The following &s;pring, I gave this field two plowings, the fir&s;t as &s;hallow as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;econd obliquely deeper, which turned up the &s;heeps dung. I then harrowed it as flat as po&s;&s;ible, to lay it even fit for mowing. I then &s;owed it with &s;pring barley, pretty thick in the drills, at a foot di&s;tance in the rows, which took &s;ix pecks to the acre, and
<PB N="96" REF="026198_0104_0FD03320187CD450">
&s;owed, broad ca&s;t, at the rate of &s;ix pounds of clover, and four pounds of trefoil &s;eed per acre, and harrowed it in at once with light harrows.</P>
<P>This method of &s;owing the gra&s;s &s;eeds with the grain, hindered me from hoeing of the barley; but its filling up the intermedi|ate &s;paces, prevented the weeds from grow|ing.</P>
<P>This barley tillered amazingly, at harve&s;t the &s;paces were filled up, the &s;traw was &s;o &s;trong, that it was with difficulty I could get it mowed; the ears were remarkably long, from fifteen to twenty grains on a &s;ide, and very full and plump.</P>
<P>I had it put in a bay of a barn by it&s;elf, had it thre&s;hed; the produce was 675 bu&s;hels, which I &s;old for 3s. 3d. per bu&s;hel, which is 109l. 13s. 9d. or 10l. 19s. 4d. &frac12; per acre pro|fit; for the clover and trefoil growing up with the barley, made the &s;traw fine fodder, &s;uperior to bad hay, therefore more than paid all expences.</P>
<P>What gra&s;s growed after harve&s;t, I left the winter to keep the roots warm. In the &s;ucceeding &s;pring, early, I &s;owed a&s;hes all
<PB N="97" REF="026198_0105_0FD033222861B138">
over the field on the gra&s;s, and rolled it. I had two fine crops of hay, which I &s;tacked by it&s;elf: the fir&s;t cutting was upwards of eighteen tons, the &s;econd about twelve tons; &s;o that the produce was three tons per acre, which that year was worth 5l. per ton.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the la&s;t crop of hay was off, I gave it one deep plowing, and &s;owed red Lammas wheat in drills, at one foot di&s;tance, one bu&s;hel of &s;eed to the acre. The begin|ning of May following, I had it hoed with a running hoe (of which I &s;hall give a de|&s;cription hereafter) and had the weeds pulled out of the rows, which together co&s;t me 5s. per acre.</P>
<P>At harve&s;t there was not a weed to be &s;een, and the ears of the wheat were &s;o full and heavy, that they hanged downwards. I had it reaped, and hou&s;ed by it&s;elf, and thre&s;hed; the produce 565 bu&s;hels, which is 56 bu|&s;hels and an half per acre, which I &s;old for 7s. per bu&s;hel, is 19l. 15s. 6d. per acre; from which deduct the expences of once plowing, 8s. &s;eed 8s. drilling in the grain 4s. hoeing 5s. reaping 10s. hou&s;eing 6s. thre&s;hing and carrying to market 15s. the whole amount|ing

to 2l. 16s. deducted from 19l. 15s. 6d. leaves a profit of 16l. 19s. 6d. per acre.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as harve&s;t was done, I plowed in the wheat &s;tubble, and let it lay in a rough &s;tate the winter. In the &s;pring early I har|rowed it, and gave it a deep plowing, and &s;owed, broad ca&s;t, twenty bu&s;hels of the white Poland oats, and harrowed them in. In May had them weeded by four boys, who were a week, which co&s;t me 12s. Had them cut at harve&s;t, and put by them&s;elves and thre&s;hed; the produce was 640 bu&s;hels, which I &s;old for 3s. per bu&s;hel, is 96l. or 64 bu&s;hels per acre, is 9l. 12s. from which deduct the expences of once plowing, 8s. two bu&s;hels of &s;eed, 6s. &s;owing and harrow|ing, 3s. weeding, 12s. mowing, 4s. hou&s;e|ing, 6s. thre&s;hing and carrying to market, 12s. the whole amounting to 2l. 11s. de|ducted from 9l. 12s. leaves a profit of 7l. 1s per acre.</P>
<P>The land having gone under its regular cour&s;e, is ready to begin with fallowing and manuring again, which will continualy keep the land improving, in&s;tead of impoveri&s;h|ing; and as it is five years going through its regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the land under tillage, &s;hould be divided into five parts&mdash;for in|&s;tance,
<PB N="99" REF="026198_0107_0FD03327DDBD9238">
we will &s;uppo&s;e a plantation to be 50 acres, or 500; if 50 acres, there will be 10 fallowed every year, 10 under gra&s;s, and 10 under barley, 10 under wheat, and 10 un|der oats; if 500, there will be 100 acres under each.</P>
<P>I am fully convinced, that 50 acres of land properly managed, will produce more than 500 badly conducted. The profits of the 10 acres, if you examine the above ac|counts, you will find brought upwards of 120l. a year, clear profit. If 50 acres were conducted in the &s;ame manner, the profits would be 600l. a year.</P>
<P>I think that tho&s;e ob&s;ervations evidently confirm, that &s;avings of manure and labour, in hu&s;bandry, produce poverty; and that lands are too frequently brought into di&s;re|pute, from the want of proper management. I am well convinced, that there is no land (that can be plowed) let it be of what &s;ort or nature it will, but may be made to pro|duce a profitable crop, either of grain or gra&s;s (if the proper &s;ort was adapted to the &s;oil) and that it would be much more advan|tageous to cultivate one hundred acres, in a
<PB N="100" REF="026198_0108_0FD033295A77B9F0">
complete manner, than two hundred acres, in a &s;lovenly and imperfect manner.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that Providence never intended tilled land &s;hould remain uncrop|ped; becau&s;e weeds will naturally grow on the poore&s;t, as well as better &s;oils; and oc|cupy land, which, with judicious manage|ment, may be advantageou&s;ly cultivated, by meliorating hoed crops; and tho&s;e vacancies in the fields where grain has been &s;own too thin, or de&s;troyed by birds or in&s;ects, are generally filled with weeds, which impove|ri&s;h the &s;oil more than grain. Hence fallows are unnece&s;&s;ary, where fallow crops can be introduced.</P>
<P>I have made numerous experiments on fal|low crops, which if I was to in&s;ert the whole, would &s;well this treati&s;e far beyond its limits; and as they might tend more to perplex than to convey u&s;eful knowledge, I will only &s;e|lect the mo&s;t u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Curious re&s;earches into the works of Pro|vidence, will inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e, why &s;ome crops improve lands more than others: let this enquiry be our pre&s;ent attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="026198_0109_0FD0332AD9F6B2B0">Beans, peas, potatoes, tares, vetches, clo|ver, lucern, &s;aint-foin, burner, trefoil, and every other vegetable and gra&s;s that produce a &s;ucculent leaf, imbibe much nouri&s;hment from the atmo&s;phere; their &s;hade prevents the &s;olar rays exhaling the moi&s;ture from their roots, which are numerous.</P>
<P>Hor&s;e beans are a very good fallow crop, but will not grow on all lands; a &s;trong loam or clay are mo&s;t &s;uitable: &s;ands and gravels are contrary to their nature. On a &s;oil that &s;uits them, their tap roots will grow from twelve to eighteen inches, or more, perpendicularly deep. Their numerous fibres, or laternal roots, will extend them&s;elves ho|rizontally in a well loo&s;ened &s;oil, as long as their roots and their &s;ize will be in propor|tion. Con&s;equently the increa&s;e of produce, will al&s;o be in proportion to the roots and fibres.</P>
<P>I have particularly ob&s;erved in dry &s;um|mers, that the greater the di&s;tance between, and the thinner the beans grew in the rows, the more they were blighted; but when thick they were not much affected. This convin|ced me, that there was not a &s;ufficient &s;hade to prevent the &s;un from exhaling more moi|&s;ture from the roots, than what is returned
<PB N="102" REF="026198_0110_0FD0333404719E78">
by dews. In order to remedy this, where the beans grew thin, I have given them deep and frequent hoeings, which had the de&s;ired effect; for the ground being kept open, the dews ea&s;ily penetrated to the roots.</P>
<P>The blight is occa&s;ioned by the plants be|ing deprived of nouri&s;hment, that for want of a proper &s;upply of juices, they become &s;ickly, the circulation being &s;topped in the leaves and extreme parts of their &s;talks. Hence the per&s;piration is converted into a &s;weet mucilage, which harbours the black in&s;ect called the Dolphin Fly, but vulgarly termed the Blight.</P>
<P>As beans are a profitable crop, as well as great benefit to the land, and will grow on &s;tiff lands in the drie&s;t &s;ummers, ob&s;erving the cautions above. I will give directi|ons for their cultivation. They may follow any grain; and to prepare the land for them, plow in the &s;tubble after harve&s;t; a month after, harrow it well, and late in the fall give it another plowing, as deep as po&s;&s;ible, cro&s;s|ways, in one-bout ridges. In the winter, haul on the manure, and as &s;oon as the wea|ther will permit, in the &s;pring, &s;pread the
<PB N="103" REF="026198_0111_0FD0333ADC46E058">
manure, and plow it in, and &s;et or &s;ow your beans as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If you have a drill, &s;ow them at a foot di&s;tance between the rows, and at three in|ches in the rows. If you have no drill, &s;train a line, and &s;et them with dibbers, at the &s;ame di&s;tance about three inches deep in the ground. It will take four bu&s;hels of &s;eed to the acre. As &s;oon as they are up three or four inches high, they &s;hould be hoed, and as &s;oon as they begin blo&s;&s;oming, &s;hould be hoed again and moulded up.</P>
<P>By this method I have had 90 bu&s;hels on an acre, which I have &s;old at 5s. the bu&s;hel, and an excellent crop of wheat the following year. They are the be&s;t feed for hor&s;es, and hogs, far exceeding any other grain for fat|tening.</P>
<P>The next fallow crop that ranks on my li&s;t is peas; their effects as a meliorating crop are great; their &s;hade prevents the &s;olar rays exal|ing the moi&s;ture from their roots. In a well pulverized &s;oil, the roots of peas will extend horizontally from twelve to eighteen inches; for the clo&s;er the peas are planted in the drills, the more they thrive and enrich the land: and in&s;tead of robbing each other of their
<PB N="104" REF="026198_0112_0FD0333FDE7FA9B8">
food, they become combined into a formida|ble body&mdash;Therefore, by &s;upporting each other, they are better enabled (than when &s;ingle or few in number), to force their pa&s;&s;age through the earth in &s;earch of food.</P>
<P>The more numerous are the plants of peas, the thicker is the &s;hade, and the more is the moi&s;ture retained in the ground. Hence they cau&s;e a putrid fermentation which ferti|lizes the &s;oil.</P>
<P>Early hoeing kills weeds, prevents their growth, &s;o as to be &s;oon &s;tifled by the drilled peas; it al&s;o loo&s;ens the &s;oil, and admits the extention of the roots; and as they are ge|nerally cut early, time permits to give the bet|ter tillage for wheat. They will grow in all &s;oils; but in a &s;tiff fertile ground, they yield the greate&s;t crops.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal &s;orts of field peas; but the mo&s;t u&s;eful are the Marlborough, maple, horn-grey, blue poplar and Dutch admi|rals. The Marlborough and maple, are large peas; the former is &s;peckled, and the latter of a hazle color; the horn-grey, and blue, are &s;mall peas; the former of a grey color, the latter of a blue. The poplar, and Dutch
<PB N="105" REF="026198_0113_0FCF58615EEDD0F0">
admiral, are white peas; the former &s;mall, and the latter large.</P>
<P>Of all pul&s;es that are &s;own or propagated, peas claim the pre-eminence, not only for their general u&s;e, both by &s;ea and land, for man and hor&s;e, but al&s;o for the diver&s;ity of their kinds &s;uited to different &s;oils. The large &s;ort require a rich moi&s;t earth, and the &s;mall will grow on &s;ands and gravels. If the crop is &s;ufficient to &s;hade its roots, once or twice hoeing will be &s;ufficient; but if not, and the &s;ummer &s;hould be a dry one, they will re|quire frequent hoeings to prevent the dol|phin fly from taking of them.</P>
<P>The land &s;hould be prepared in the &s;ame manner as I have directed for beans; the &s;mall &s;ort are hardie&s;t, therefore may be &s;own early in the &s;pring; the others &s;hould be &s;own &s;ome time in April at furthe&s;t; the large &s;orts of peas &s;hould be &s;own in drills, one to every inch and half, and three feet between. The &s;mall &s;orts &s;hould be one inch apart in the drills, and two feet between; four bu&s;hels of &s;eed is the quantity for an acre. I have had 90 bu&s;hels on an acre, which I have &s;old for 5s. per bu&s;hel, and have had a very great crop of wheat the following year.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="026198_0114_0FD03341ABB22840">The next fallow crop on my li&s;t is potatoes, which are generally &s;uppo&s;ed to impoveri&s;h land.

<P>Although the ground was dug about a foot deep, the plants and fibres did not grow perpendicularly, but horizontally acro&s;s the rows, &s;o far and &s;o high as the loo&s;ened or hoed earth extended.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="026198_0116_0FD0334859363558">Hence it evidently appears, that the &s;oil be|ing continually moved by the growth of the potatoes and hoeings, its particles are &s;o mi|nutely divided, as to permit the free admi&s;|&s;ion for the atmo&s;pherical influences, which fertilize the land, and renders the &s;ucceeding crops more productive after a fallow crop; for the &s;oil being more pulverized, the roots of the &s;ucceeding plants can the ea&s;ier range in &s;earch of food; which, in proportion to the nouri&s;hment they acquire, fills the grain, and makes it weigh heavier, than when its roots are confined; and is the mo&s;t certain proof, that good tillage is one of the greate&s;t &s;ecrets in agriculture.</P>
<P>I am convinced from the many experi|ments I have made, that on good loamy or &s;tiff &s;oils, wheat may alternately &s;ucceed ei|ther beans, peas, potatoes, or any other me|liorating hoed crops for any number of years, provided the &s;tubble is immediately, or &s;oon after harve&s;t, plowed as deep as the &s;tratum will admit, into one bout ridges, by which the &s;oil will be kept dry and expo&s;ed to the fro&s;ts, that will pulverize it. This mode, with the addition of proper manure, once in about four years, will keep the land in excellent order, and improve it. I have experienced,
<PB N="109" REF="026198_0117_0FD03349D68F2D50">
that one plowing in the fall, is of more benefit, than two plowings in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>As manures cannot always be procured in &s;ufficient quantities to dre&s;s all the land the farmer would wi&s;h, I will put him in a way, from my own experience, which, with a few &s;hillings, and a little labour, he may dre&s;s an acre of land, or as many as he plea&s;|es.</P>
<P>In &s;ands and gravels, buck-wheat plowed in while green, is a good dre&s;&s;ing. The land &s;hould be plowed in the fall, and laid up in ridges as before directed, to bring the land into a fine tilth, harrowed and plowed in the &s;pring, and the beginning of May &s;hould be &s;own with a bu&s;hel and an half of buck-wheat, and harrowed in, in July. When in full bloom it &s;hould be well rolled and plowed in, in broad lands. When this is done, there will &s;ome appear above ground, between the furrows, that the plow did not cover. This mu&s;t be &s;truck down with an iron in&s;trument, like a paddle, or paring-&s;ho|vel, and let it lie in that &s;tate for a month.</P>
<P>In this time it will &s;moak, &s;o as to be &s;een a great way, like a dung-hill; and as it is a green dre&s;&s;ing will quickly rot in the ground.
<PB N="110" REF="026198_0118_0FD03354E9CB3FD0">
The next thing is to harrow it; then plow and &s;ow wheat in broad lands; if you have a good crop of buck-wheat, it will be a good dre&s;&s;ing for three years.</P>
<P>This great improver of land is &s;uch a friend to the farmer, that if its value was more generally known, this method would be more practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>When the crop of wheat is off, you may plow in the &s;tubble and &s;ow winter barley, and the &s;ucceeding year oats, and after that a turnip fallow, to clear it well from weeds.</P>
<P>Clover plowed in, is a good green dre&s;&s;|ing. You may mow the fir&s;t crop; and if you have a good &s;econd crop, do not be afraid of plowing it in, as it will fully repay you in your crop of wheat. It &s;hould be rolled and plowed in, the &s;ame as the buck-wheat. After it has lain &s;ome time to rot, you may harrow in your wheat; for it &s;hould not be plowed again, as directed for the buck-wheat.</P>
<P>I had near my hou&s;e a &s;mall field which contained three acres and a quarter, two acres of it were &s;aintfoin, and the remainder
<PB N="111" REF="026198_0119_0FD0335A8CCA71D0">
acre and a quarter was lucern. The&s;e gra&s;&s;es &s;erved eight hor&s;es (which was in continual work) for green meat; during the &s;ummer, it was cut and brought to the &s;table, a &s;mall patch every day, and by the time they had gone over the field, where they had fir&s;t be|gan was ready for cutting again.</P>
<P>In about ten years the lucern began to wear out; that is, the twich and weeds had got the better of it; therefore in the fall of the year, I had that acre and quarter plowed up; it was &s;o tough and matted with the twich gra&s;s and weeds, that the furrows were &s;olid from one end to the other. I had it tore to pieces with heavy harrows, and with rakes had the rubbi&s;h collected together in heaps, got &s;ome dry bru&s;h wood and put it under the heaps and &s;et it on fire; &s;pread the a&s;hes and gave it another plowing, and laid it up in one bout ridges.</P>
<P>In the following &s;pring harrowed it well, and raked the &s;tuff together and burnt it, and &s;pread the a&s;hes as before, and gave it ano|ther plowing; the latter end of May, harrow|ed and plowed it again. By this time it was as fine as a garden. The beginning of July plowed it and &s;owed it with tur|nips; had a very great crop, which paid
<PB N="112" REF="026198_0120_0FD0335BCDA729B8">
me upwards of 20l. by feeding it with &s;heep. In the following &s;pring, &s;owed &s;pring barley, and lucern, each at 12 inches apart in the rows, that is, a row of lucern, between every row of barley, and a row of barley between every row of lucern; &s;o that there was 6 in|ches between the barley, and lucern. At harve&s;t I had upwards of 80 bu&s;hels of bar|ley cut off the acre and quarter, and a very promi&s;ing crop of lucern left, and &s;o clean not a weed to be &s;een; in the following &s;pring had it hoed, cut it the latter end of May, had a ton and half of hay. As &s;oon as the hay was off, had it hoed; the latter end of July cut again, had about a ton of hay; had it hoed as before, in October cut it again, had upwards of half a ton of hay.</P>
<P>This method I pur&s;ued, and the crops in|crea&s;ed every year. The following year I had about a ton more, and the third year when I reckoned it had come to maturity, I had upwards of five tons. This proves as I &s;aid before, that good tillage is the grand &s;e|cret of agriculture, and the crops will am|ply pay the hu&s;bandman for his labour.</P>

<HEAD>OF PLOWING AND HARROWING.</HEAD>
<P>Plowing is the action of breaking up, open|ing, and pulverizing the &s;oil, that the roots and tender fibres of plants may be enabled to ex|tend them&s;elves in que&s;t of food.</P>
<P>When the &s;oil has been well loo&s;ened by deep repeated plowings and harrowings, its particles are minutely divided, and the roots of plants have liberty to &s;pread freely. Hence they are enabled to acquire &s;uch nouri&s;hment as could not po&s;&s;ibly be obtained, when con|fined between large impenetrable clods of earth.</P>
<P>Thorough plowing, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;upplies the want of manure, by keeping the earth in a loo&s;e &s;tate, ready for the re|ception of atmo&s;pherical influences.</P>
<P>Duhamel &s;ays, "It is much more profita|ble to increa&s;e the fruitfulne&s;s of land by tillage than by dung:</P>
<P N="1">"1&s;t. Becau&s;e only a certain quantity of dung can often times be had, the produce of 20 acres being &s;carcely &s;ufficient to dung one;
<PB N="114" REF="026198_0122_0FCF586710D8AEE0">
whereas the particles of the earth may be divided and &s;ub-divided, ad infinitum. The benefit that can be procured from dungs is therefore limited; whereas no bounds can be &s;et to the advantages which ari&s;e from tillage</P>
<P N="2">"2d. Mo&s;t plants that are reared in dung, have not the fine flavour of tho&s;e that grow in a good &s;oil, which has not been dunged. Greens and fruits are &s;eldom &s;o good in the neighborhood of great cities, where dung abounds, as in country gardens, where it cannot be &s;o lavi&s;hly be&s;towed. But no|thing is more &s;triking, than the difference between wine produced by a vine that has not been dunged at all, and that which is made from a vine that has been greatly dunged.</P>
<P N="3">"3d. Dung, which according to Mr. Tull, acts by fermentation, cau&s;es indeed an inter|nal divi&s;ion of the particles, which may be of great u&s;e; but the plough not only di|vides the particles, but changes the &s;ituation, by turning the earth up&s;ide down. The part which was expo&s;ed to the influence of the air and dew, takes the place of another part which is removed from underneath to the &s;urface, and the earth that is turned up is penetrated by the rain and dew, and by the rays of the &s;un; all which greatly conduce to render it fertile.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="115" REF="026198_0123_0FD0336C0A8976C8">"4th. Dung harbours in&s;ects, which af|terwards feed upon the plants and &s;poil them. It is well known, that when lands are dung|ed in which trees are planted, their roots are in great danger of being hurt by in&s;ects; and this is one of the chief rea&s;ons why flo|ri&s;ts bani&s;h dung from their gardens.</P>
<P N="5">"5th. It is true, that dung is equally be|neficial to light and &s;tiff grounds; but the &s;ame may be &s;aid of tillage.</P>
<P>"Too &s;trong land is that of which the parts are &s;o clo&s;e, that roots cannot penetrate them without great difficulty.</P>
<P>"Now, if roots cannot extend them&s;elves freely in the earth, they cannot draw from it the food of plants, which, for want of that food, will droop and langui&s;h. But when tho&s;e lands &s;hall have been divided by tillage, when their particles &s;hall have been &s;o &s;epa|rated, that roots are at liberty to extend them|&s;elves, and traver&s;e all tho&s;e &s;mall &s;paces, they will be able to &s;upply the plants with their nece&s;&s;ary food, and they will thrive apace."</P>
<P>Tillage is equally beneficial to light lands; but for a contrary rea&s;on. The fault of the&s;e
<PB N="116" REF="026198_0124_0FD03373765E9440">
lands is their having too great &s;paces between their particles; and as mo&s;t of tho&s;e &s;paces have no communication one with another, the roots traver&s;ing the great cavities, with|out touching the particles of the earth, draw con&s;equently no nouri&s;hment from it. But when the particles have been broken by re|peated plowings, the le&s;&s;er intervals are mul|tiplied at the expence of the greater: the roots have liberty to extend them&s;elves, and they glide in, as it were between the particles, meeting with a certain re&s;i&s;tance which is nece&s;&s;ary to their taking in the nutritive juice which the earth contains.</P>
<P>Mr. Evelyn, quoting Sir. Hugh Platt, &s;ays, "That if you take a certain quantity of even the mo&s;t barren earth, you can find, reduce it to a fine powder, and expo&s;e it for a year to the vici&s;&s;itudes and changes of the &s;ea&s;on, and influences of the heavens, it will acquire &s;uch a generous and ma&s;culine pregnancy, within that period, as to be able to receive an exotic plant from the farthe&s;t Indies, and to cau&s;e all vegetables to pro&s;per in the mo&s;t exalted degree, and to bear their fruit as kindly with us, as they do in their natural climates."</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="026198_0125_0FD033772DF025A8">We are to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e exotics to have their due degrees of heat and moi&s;ture given them. To what &s;hall we a&s;cribe this great fertility? To the great divi&s;ion of the par|ticles of the earth, and the multiplication of their &s;urfaces.</P>
<P>"By this toil (viz. pulverizing the earth,) adds he, "it is found that &s;oil may be &s;o al|tered from its former nature, as to render the har&s;h, and mo&s;t uncivil clay, ob&s;equeous to the hu&s;bandman, and to bring forth roots and plants, which otherwi&s;e require the lighte&s;t and hollowe&s;t mould.</P>
<P>"But what proves how beneficial plowing is in &s;trong lands to facilitate the pa&s;&s;ages of the water, of the rays of the &s;un, and of the roots of plants, is, that their fertility is &s;ome|times increa&s;ed by mixing them with &s;and in|&s;tead of dung.</P>
<P>"Sand it&s;elf affords no nouri&s;hment, but by preventing the particles from returning, it produces the de&s;ired good effects. It does not appear, that light grounds require quite &s;o many plowings. It might even be feared, lea&s;t by frequent turnings of &s;uch lands, and expo&s;ing their parts to the &s;un, they might be exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="026198_0126_0FD0337824941708">"But though the &s;un robs the earth of its moi&s;ture, yet few of the particles fit for the nouri&s;hment of plants are exhau&s;ted with it; and experience &s;hows, that light lands are bettered by being plowed; either becau&s;e the breaking and &s;tiring of their particles renders them fitter to receive the moi&s;ture of rain and dew, to profit by the influencees of the air, and be penetrated by the rays of the &s;un; or that the internal pores are better fitted for the ex|ten&s;ion of roots; or again, becau&s;e frequent plowings de&s;troys weeds, which are more apt to grow in light grounds than in &s;trong, e&s;pecially when they are dunged.</P>
<P>"To prove by an experiment, what we have ju&s;t advanced, with re&s;pect to light &s;oils: let one half of a field be indifferently plowed, and the other half be plowed extremely well. Some time after, and in dry weather, let the whole field be cro&s;s-plowed. The land of that half the field which was thoroughly plow|ed, will be of a darker colour than that of the other half, which was but &s;lightly plowed. This &s;hews the benefit the land has received by plowing.</P>
<P>Some think to &s;upply the want of plowing, by harrowing their land greatly after it has
<PB N="119" REF="026198_0127_0FD0337AEE15BAC0">
been &s;own; but this way of &s;cratching the earth is of little &s;ervice; and, when it is moi&s;t, the hor&s;es poach and damage it con&s;i|derably."</P>
<P>In the year 1759, Mr. Delu gave five plowings to a wheat field, which had not been dunged; and at harve&s;t, had taller and finer grain there than any the neighboring grounds produced, which had been dunged and culti|vated in the u&s;ual way.</P>
<P>I knew a farmer, who had not &s;ufficient quantity of dung to cover more than half his fallow, which he &s;owed with wheat; the other half he intended for &s;pring barley, but was advi&s;ed (rather than leave the ground uncropped) to give two extraordinary plow|ings, and &s;ow that al&s;o with wheat, which he did; and reaped a greater crop of better grain off the undunged than the dunged land.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the advantage re&s;ulting from tho|rough pulverizing the land is &s;o great, parti|cularly when plants are growing, that in &s;ome places it has been found fully to repay the expences, even of hoeing between grain &s;own broad ca&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>FERTILIZING STEEPS.</HEAD>
<P>As I have made numerous experiments with &s;teeps; to recapitulate the whole, might tend to bewilder the imagination. There|fore as I have found the following to be the mo&s;t fertilizing, and effectual to prevent blights and &s;mut, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to them only.</P>
<P>Take one peck and an half of fre&s;h and dry wood a&s;hes, and one peck of un&s;lacked lime, which put into a tub that will contain about 40 gallons of water, then add as much water as will &s;lack the lime, and render the mixture (which &s;hould be well incorporated) into the con&s;i&s;tence of &s;tiff morter; in this &s;tate it &s;hould remain ten or twelve hours; afterwards add as much water as will reduce the mortar to a pulp, by &s;tirring; then fill the tub with water, which mu&s;t be &s;tirred for two or three days; then draw off the clear lye into a proper ve&s;&s;el for &s;teeping the grain, and gradually put the grain into it, &s;kimming off the light grain that &s;wims.</P>
<P>After it has &s;teeped &s;ix hours, let it be ta|ken
<PB N="121" REF="026198_0129_0FD0337D5BA020D8">
out, and immediately &s;pread on a clean floor to dry, when it will be &s;ufficiently pre|pared for drilling or &s;owing. The lye will retain its full virtue, and the &s;ame may be repeatedly u&s;ed.</P>
<P>On examining the grains of wheat and barley through a micro&s;cope, I have frequent|ly ob&s;erved the animalcules which appeared like &s;mall quantities of black powder on the flat or hollow part, or on the downy and ger|minating end of the grain.</P>
<P>In order to di&s;cover what effect the &s;teep lye would have on in&s;ects, I procured two common red worms, alike in &s;ize and &s;trength, one was put into a gla&s;s of &s;pring water, the other into a gla&s;s of the lye; the la&s;t imme|diately appeared to be in great agonies, and died within forty minutes. The worm that was put into the &s;pring water, was alive and active at the expiration of three weeks.</P>
<P>From this experiment I conclude, that as the lye operated &s;o violently on an amphi|bious in&s;ect, animalcules, that are not am|phibious, mu&s;t naturally be de&s;troyed in a much &s;horter time. And in every experi|ment, I have found this lye to an&s;wer fully
<PB N="122" REF="026198_0130_0FD03380C64A0BE0">
my expectations as a fetilizer, killing the animalcule and preventing blights and &s;mut.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add one more, by u&s;ing of which, I have had amazing large crops:</P>
<P>Take half a bu&s;hel of the grain you intend &s;owing, put it to five pails-full of water, and boil it in a copper till the grain bur&s;ts, and the water thereby becomes impregnated with the e&s;&s;ential &s;alt of &s;uch grain; &s;train the liquor, (you may give the grain to the poultry, that there may be no wa&s;te,) while the liquor is hot put three pounds of nitre, or refined &s;alt pe|tre, that it may di&s;&s;olve, and add four or five pails-full of water which drains from the dung hill, or &s;tale urine of any &s;ort. And in this prepared liquor &s;teep the grain twelve hours.</P>
<P>Let the liquor be four inches above the grain in the fat or tub, as the grain will &s;well and imbibe it. This liquor mu&s;t be warm when the grain is put in, and &s;top all as clo&s;e as you can, for that cau&s;es the &s;alts to be put in motion. Imbibe the grain in the morning, and in the evening take it out, and &s;pread it on a clean floor to dry, and by morning it will be fit to &s;ow. The liquor that is left, will &s;erve again, with the additi|on
<PB N="123" REF="026198_0131_0FCF5867AE2270A8">
of 3 lbs. of nitre, and when you have done with it, it is admirable to &s;prinkle over a garden.</P>
<P>The excellency of this receipt, is obvious in &s;everal ca&s;es. 1&s;t. It &s;aves &s;eed. 2d. It in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upplies the defect of full dre&s;&s;ing the land, by the &s;eed being full of riches when &s;own. 3d. It produces a greater quantity than ordinary; la&s;tly, by this &s;teep|ing, the grain will make its way out of the ground, if drought &s;hould &s;ucceed, which of|ten is the ca&s;e in &s;pring grain, to lay a long time before it vegetates. From this receipt, I have had from thirty to forty ears from one root.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent mode of cultivation in this country, is very imperfect and erroneous. I &s;hall fir&s;t ob&s;erve the meadows, which, in general, are &s;wamps, bogs, or other parts where &s;tagnated waters lay, which kills the natural gra&s;s and &s;weet herbage, and forces up in its room a &s;our coar&s;e gra&s;s full of tu&s;|&s;ucks, that has no nouri&s;hment in it, either for creature or bea&s;t. If that &s;ort of land was properly drained, according to the di|rections before given, that noxious gra&s;s would die of it&s;elf, and &s;weet herbage grow in its room. The watered meadows, like|wi&s;e,
<PB N="124" REF="026198_0132_0FD033877198D6A0">
produce a &s;our wa&s;hy hay, that has in it very little nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>I will maintain that there is more nouri&s;h|ment in one ton of good upland hay, than there is in three tons of that &s;ort.</P>
<P>Every farmer might choo&s;e &s;ome of his upland for natural gra&s;s, and as for foreign gra&s;&s;es, they might be adapted to the dif|ferent &s;oils. The poore&s;t land will bring good crops of &s;ome of them, of which I &s;hall treat hereafter. See foreign gra&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Secondly, on arable land. The farmers in general, in this country &s;eem to have &s;tudied the cultivation of no grain but maize or Indian corn: the culture of that they appear to un|der&s;tand well. It &s;uits the Indians, as they have &s;uch a plenty of land, but being of a roving di&s;po&s;ition they are not longer in a place than ju&s;t to have two or three crops, and then remove to another &s;pot. That cultivati|on may &s;uit &s;ome of the farmers here, as well as the Indians (from whom they learned) as long as they can do like them; that is when they have wore out their land, to remove to another place; but when this country increa&s;|es
<PB N="125" REF="026198_0133_0FD03390238304C8">
in population, and gets thicker inhabited, the ca&s;e will be altered.</P>
<P>There is no grain &s;o great an impoveri&s;her of land as Indian corn; yet I have &s;een it planted on land that would have brought an excellent crop of wheat; and if they had two &s;ucceeding crops of wheat, it would not have impoveri&s;hed the land &s;o much as one of corn.</P>
<P>Wheat in general follows the corn, &s;own among it as it &s;tands: and &s;o on alternately, till the land is worn out. By this method, there is &s;eldom above two or three good crops at fir&s;t; every &s;ucceeding crop dwindles, which on the contrary, were they to follow the dictates of rea&s;on, in changing the crops from impoveri&s;hing to a meliorating, proper plowing, manuring, &amp;c. they would &s;oon find the benefit.</P>
<P>By peru&s;ing this treati&s;e with proper at|tention, every thing that is nece&s;&s;ary may be known: but as there are &s;everal ob&s;tinate and conceited people, &s;ome very ignorant men that I have di&s;cour&s;ed with&mdash;who have told me, they know as much of farming as any

one&mdash;&s;uch people I do not expect will give them&s;elves that trouble.</P>
<P>For a new and advantageous mode of cul|ture, I refer the reader to my experiments on fallows and fallow crops, wherein is proved by occular demon&s;trations, the advan|tages accruing by proper pulverizing the earth, changing of crops, and letting grain and gra&s;&s;es grow in rotation, which will con|tinually keep the land in &s;ufficient heart to &s;upport its crops.</P>

<P>The cone or bearded, is hardy, and will &s;tand the inclemency of the weather, better than either, neither is the fly &s;o apt to take it; be&s;ides the long beard protects it from the mildews; but the flour is har&s;h and coar&s;e; therefore that &s;ort of wheat &s;ells &s;ix pence in a bu&s;hel, cheaper than the other. The &s;pring or Siberian is very u&s;eful, as there is more time to prepare the land, that it may be &s;own after the winter fallow; there is one caution I beg leave to notice, that the grain of &s;pring or Si|berian wheat, is much more liable to drop out of the ears than the winter wheat. Hence, it &s;hould be particularly attended to, and cut before it is too ripe.</P>
<P>When wheat is planted or &s;own early in the fall, le&s;s &s;eed is required to the acre, than when planted late; becau&s;e le&s;s of it will die; and poor land &s;hould always be allowed more &s;eed than rich, becau&s;e a greater number of the plants will peri&s;h on this land than the other. The lea&s;t quantity
<PB N="128" REF="026198_0136_0FD03392BA2DC898">
of &s;eed is nece&s;&s;ary for rich land, that is &s;own early; for, in this ca&s;e, very few of the &s;eeds will fail to produce a plant that will live and flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>The un&s;kilful hu&s;bandman con&s;iders none of the&s;e things: he goes by a general rule; at all &s;ea&s;ons, and on all &s;orts of lands, the quantity is the &s;ame &s;own.</P>
<P>Another thing to be con&s;idered, is, that &s;ome wheat of the &s;ame &s;pecies has its grains twice as large as others: in this ca&s;e, a bu|&s;hel, containing but half the number of grains that it does in &s;maller grained wheat, one bu|&s;hel of the &s;mall grained will go as far as two bu&s;hels of the large; it is not the mea&s;ure of the &s;eeds, but the number of the grains be|ing the thing to be con&s;idered in regard to the &s;owing.</P>
<P>It is a very natural thing to &s;uppo&s;e, that a large grained wheat will produce larger and finer plants, and larger grain than a &s;mall grained one; but my experiments have prov|ed that there is nothing in this; for the &s;mall|e&s;t grained wheat has produced full as large plants as the large&s;t, and tho&s;e with as great
<PB N="129" REF="026198_0137_0FD03393DA176D98">
ears and as large &s;eeds; but the young plants appeared &s;maller and poorer.</P>
<P>Wheat is the propere&s;t grain of any to fol|low clover, lucern, &s;aintfoin, or any other gra&s;&s;es: becau&s;e it will be&s;t bear with &s;our tilth, to harrow it in after one plowing.</P>
<P>The be&s;t method for tho&s;e who keep &s;heep is to plow about half an acre at a time; &s;ow that, and pen the &s;heep on it; then plow half an acre more and do the like, and &s;o on till the field is done. The larger the fold the better, for the field will be &s;ooner fini&s;hed; and by that means the &s;heep will be gone from thence before the wheat is much up.&mdash;This dre&s;&s;ing with the fold has &s;everal conveniencies; it not only enriches the land, but treads the grain in, and &s;o pre&s;erves it from dying, makes it &s;tand fa&s;t again&s;t the winds, and keeps it from &s;pewing out in the winter.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on for &s;owing winter wheat, is in the fall in moi&s;t weather, from the middle of Augu&s;t to the middle of October; the quantity of &s;eed is from three pecks to a bu|&s;hel and half per acre. The &s;pring wheat &s;hould be &s;own in the &s;pring, as &s;oon as the &s;ea|&s;on

will permit; from a bu&s;hel to a bu&s;hel and half per acre.</P>
<P>The imperfections of the old or common method of cultivation appearing to me very erroneous, cau&s;ed me to make many different experiments on wheat, as well as other dif|ferent grain, to endeavour to find out a re|medy, and if po&s;&s;ible to adopt &s;ome new or better method of culture: by ob&s;ervations and clo&s;e attention, I &s;oon &s;ucceeded. I fixed together with a pole three harrows, which, when mea&s;ured I found would cover the breadth of nine feet.</P>
<P>I accordingly had my fields formed into eight feet ridges, the three harrows complete|ly covered the&s;e ridges; and in&s;tead of the hor&s;es treading the pulverized land, four hor|&s;es were parted, two walked in the furrows each &s;ide of the ridge, by which the &s;oil was properly harrowed without being trod or har|dened, and the ground made &s;ufficiently fine. The repeated trials I have made of this new mode of culture, has &s;ufficiently confirmed me of its utility.</P>
<P>One recent experiment will, I pre&s;ume, as well as one hundred, illu&s;trate its &s;uperior ad|vantages.&mdash;

A field of four acres which had a crop of potatoes, which I could not get out of the ground before the middle of Novem|ber; therefore the land could not be got into proper order before the beginning of Decem|ber, as it was in an excellent tilth, curio&s;ity induced me to &s;ow it, even &s;o late in the &s;ea|&s;on with cone or bearded wheat; for which purpo&s;e my drill machine was u&s;ed on part of the field; which was planted with a propor|tion of three pecks to an acre, the rows at one foot apart, on ridges eight feet broad; but &s;uch an exce&s;&s;ive fall of rain commen|ced, as &s;oon reduced the &s;oil to a mere quag|mire, the hor&s;es &s;unk up to their knees in the ridges. Hence the drill could not be any more worked.</P>
<P>This part of the field being drilled, and no pro&s;pect of more favourable weather at &s;o late a period of the &s;ea&s;on, my &s;ervants and my&s;elf (attending the operation of the ma|chine) were thorougly wetted. The weather being rather warm, my people continued in the field, &s;owed the remainder with a bu&s;hel and half per acre, and even in &s;uch a wet &s;tate harrowed in the &s;eed with three harrows co|vering the ridges, two hor&s;es walking in each furrow. And that I might be further con|vinced of the di&s;advantages attending the
<PB N="132" REF="026198_0140_0FCF58750DE37F08">
hor&s;es treading on the ground, I had two ridges harrowed by the hor&s;es walking there|on.</P>
<P>The beginning of May, I had the drilled wheat hoed, which co&s;t me four &s;hillings per acre; the other part of the field was weeded, at an expence of five &s;hillings per acre; and during the whole time of its grow|ing, the drilled wheat, vi&s;&s;ibly appeared &s;u|perior, in every re&s;pect, to the broad ca&s;t; the &s;traw was in &s;ize &s;imilar to reeds, many mea&s;ured &s;ix feet in length, and the ears con|tained from ninety to one hundred and twen|ty grains.</P>
<P>The beginning of September, I had three perches each, of the drilled, the broad ca&s;t by the new mode of culture, and the broad|ca&s;t &s;own in the common way, carefully cut, carried into the granary, and there thre&s;hed; and altho' &s;uch a number of inconveniences attending it, &s;uch as bad weather for &s;owing, the late &s;ea&s;on, the birds, in&s;tigated by hun|ger, at that &s;ea&s;on, pick up a great deal of the grain, will even &s;cratch off the &s;now and get at the milky grain, which they feed on; under all tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters the produce was as follows: the drilled, four pecks and half a pint; or per acre, fifty-three bu&s;hels and
<PB N="133" REF="026198_0141_0FCF587A4B063078">
three pecks. The broad ca&s;t, new mode, three pecks and ten pints; or, per acre forty-eight bu&s;hels, one peck and five pints. The broad ca&s;t, old mode, two pecks and &s;ix pints; or, per acre, thirty-one bu&s;hels, two pecks and ten pints.</P>
<P>This comparative view, clearly illu&s;trates the di&s;advantages attending hor&s;es walking on the grain, after it is &s;owed; which old mode produced near &s;eventeen bu&s;hels per acre le&s;s, than by the new method of the hor&s;es walking in the furrows; and although the drill worked to every di&s;advantage, in what might be partly called mortar, with only depo&s;iting half the &s;eed, and at twelve inches di&s;tance between the rows; yet it produced five bu&s;hels one peck, and eleven pints more than the new broad ca&s;t mode, and twenty-two bu&s;hels &s;ix pints more than the common old broad ca&s;t mode: which plainly &s;hews the &s;uperiority of the drill hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>There is not any part of hu&s;bandry which requires the farmer's attention, more than that of keeping his land clean from weeds; and yet there are few who trouble them&s;elves about it, or who under&s;tand the proper me|thod of doing it. Few of them know tho&s;e weeds which are annual, &s;o as to di&s;tingui&s;h
<PB N="134" REF="026198_0142_0FD03399E1231010">
them from tho&s;e that are perennial; and, without this knowledge it will be much more difficult for a per&s;on to clean his land, let his indu&s;try be ever &s;o great: for annual &s;eeds may &s;oon be de&s;troyed, if taken in time; whereas, if they are neglected, their &s;eeds will &s;oon ripen, and &s;catter; after which it will require three times the labour and ex|pence to get rid of them, as would have been &s;ufficient at the beginning; and then the crop would have had no bad neighbours to rob it of its nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another great advantage in keeping grain clear of weeds, which is,&mdash;it is not &s;o liable to blight or take the &s;mut, as when it is full of weeds, as I have frequent|ly ob&s;erved; for cleanline&s;s is as e&s;&s;ential to the well doing and growth of vegetables, as in animals&mdash;And the changing of &s;eed annu|ally is al&s;o as nece&s;&s;ary as the change of air is to all &s;orts of animals: for where this has been carefully practi&s;ed, there has rarely hap|pened any &s;mutty grain on the farm.</P>
<P>When wheat is not &s;own after gra&s;&s;es (which is the be&s;t method,) the land &s;hould be fallowed and dre&s;t; the method is to plow it into narrow ridges, in the fall, and let it lay in that rough &s;tate all winter. In the
<PB N="135" REF="026198_0143_0FD0339C53071800">
&s;pring, as &s;oon as the weather will permit, harrow it down, and as &s;oon as the weeds be|gin to vegetate, plow it again; then harrow it and give it another plowing before you &s;ow; for the more it is plowed and harrowed, the better will be the crop, and the fewer weeds will be produced.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a very ab&s;urd method in common practice with the farmers, which is the carrying of their dre&s;&s;ing and &s;preading it on the land in the &s;ummer; where it lies expo&s;ed till the &s;un has dried out all the goodne&s;s of it, before it is plowed into the ground, &s;o that the dre&s;&s;ing is of little value or u&s;e; the dung &s;hould never be laid on the land fa&s;ter than it can be plowed in; for one load of dung &s;o managed, is better than three in their u&s;ual method.</P>
<P>As wheat remains in the ground a longer time than mo&s;t other &s;orts of grain, it requires a greater &s;tock of nouri&s;hment, to lengthen and fill the ears; therefore if the dre&s;&s;ing is exau&s;ted in winter, the grain will have but &s;hort ears, and tho&s;e but lean, nor will the grain afford much flour: &s;o that it frequent|ly happens, that a light dre&s;&s;ing of foot or a&s;hes in the &s;pring, at the time when the
<PB N="136" REF="026198_0144_0FD0339D9F862508">
wheat is beginning to &s;talk, proves of great &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Deep plowing, where the &s;taple of the ground is deep enough to admit of it, will al|&s;o be of great &s;ervice to the wheat or any other grain; for the &s;mall fibres of the roots, which are the mouths that &s;upply the nou|ri&s;hment, extend them&s;elves very deep into the ground: I have traced many of them up|wards of three feet, and do believe they &s;pread much farther where the ground is light; therefore it is of great advantage to the crop to have the ground loo&s;ened and &s;tirred to a proper depth.</P>

<HEAD>BARLEY,</HEAD>
<P>If cultivated in a proper manner, is a very beneficial crop even equal to wheat.

To encourage the growth of this grain, will be a benefit to the nation at large.</P>
<P>Barley is a grain that delights in a fine tilth and rich &s;oil, and will do as well with a bu&s;hel and an half of &s;eed on &s;uch land, as well as two bu&s;hels and an half on a rough and &s;our &s;oil.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="026198_0146_0FD033A22B66D318">The land for winter barley &s;hould be mana|ged the &s;ame as for wheat; potatoes prepare the land &s;uitable for it, or fallow and dre&s;s it with a compo&s;t manure, which is equal to &s;table dung.</P>
<P>Spring barley makes the be&s;t malt, if the grain is but large and plump, which if you give it proper cultivation, you may have it &s;o in the drie&s;t &s;ummers. It thrives be&s;t after a fallow crop of turnips; but if your land is good, in a fine tilth, and drill it, you will be &s;ure to have a great crop of fine bar|ley.</P>
<P>To make the ground ready for barley after wheat, pre&s;ently after harve&s;t plow in the wheat &s;tubble, in four-throughed lands; ear|ly in the &s;pring harrow it, and bought it up; let it lay a little, then bought it down; har|row it and plow it into broad lands, and &s;ow it with barley; I have taken this method on a loam&punc; and it proved a tilth as fine as a garden.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle clu&s;ter of barley growing in a field planted with peas attracted my attention. The numerous &s;talks appeared to be the pro|duce of &s;everal grains, but when pulled out of the ground, I clearly perceived they were only the produce of a &s;ingle grain, which had
<PB N="139" REF="026198_0147_0FD033A7C8687B28">
been dropped by accident; curio&s;ity induced me to count the number of ears, which were twenty-eight, containing in the whole three-hundred and thirty grains. Such an amazing increa&s;e, a&s;toni&s;hed and made me reflect, if one grain produced upwards of three hundred, how came it that farmers could procure no more, and be well &s;atisfied in obtaining a crop from thirty to forty bu&s;hels per acre from two or three bu&s;hels of &s;eed on good land? The greate&s;t of &s;uch product, is only twenty for one, and of cour&s;e le&s;s by three hundred for one, than the produce of the &s;ingle grain.</P>
<P>Being fully convinced that the old mode of cultivation was very erroneous, I determined to endeavor to find out where the errors lay. I had a bu&s;hel of barley mea&s;ured, it weighed fifty-two pounds and a quarter, and accord|ing to the grains in 1 oz. the whole bu&s;hel contained five hundred and fifteen thou&s;and grains.</P>
<P>I next had a bu&s;hel of wheat mea&s;ured, it weighed &s;ixty-two pounds, and contained five hundred and &s;ixteen thou&s;and grains. A bu&s;hel of poplar peas weighed &s;ixty-four pounds, contained one hundred and &s;even thou&s;and peas. A bu&s;hel of hor&s;e beans weighed &s;ixty-four pounds, contained thirty-five
<PB N="140" REF="026198_0148_0FD033AA8F7D87C8">
thou&s;and beans. A bu&s;hel of the Poland oats weighed thirty-two pounds, containing one million two hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and grains. The&s;e were all large &s;ized grains; therefore the &s;maller ones mu&s;t contain a con|&s;iderable quantity of more grains in the bu&s;hel.</P>
<P>Having thus far proceeded, I next reflec|ted, that admitting every grain &s;owed, was to vegetate, and produce no more than forty for one, the produce of two bu&s;hels of barley &s;eed, ought to be eighty bu&s;hels per acre.&mdash; Therefore I was fully determined as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, particularly to inve&s;tigate the future growth of grain. Opportunity did not per|mit my making any experiments till the fol|lowing &s;pring, when I had beds dug eight feet three inches long, and two feet wide, which occupies a &s;pace of one &s;ixteenth part of a &s;quare perch.</P>
<P>I thought it nece&s;&s;ary for my future con|duct and experiments in agriculture, to re|duce the weight of the bu&s;hel of barley, being fifty-two pounds and a quarter, into drachms, that I might the better be enabled to propor|tion to an acre, the quantity of &s;eed mo&s;t advantageous for drilling, and &s;owing broad ca&s;t; accordingly found that fifty-two pounds and a quarter, contained thirteen thou&s;and
<PB N="141" REF="026198_0149_0FD033ABD8D67988">
three hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix drachms. Then reduced an acre into &s;ixteenths of a perch being two thou&s;and five hundred and &s;ixty; and dividing the drachms (thirteen thou&s;and three hundred, and &s;eventy-&s;ix, the contents of the bu&s;hel,) by the number of &s;ixteens, (being two thou&s;and five hundred and &s;ixty in an acre) found the quotient to be 5 2560/157<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> part of a drachm.</P>

<P>The roots of the thick &s;own, as well as that drilled at &s;ix inches, were &s;o matted or combined together, as to keep the &s;oil more hollow, and had extended them&s;elves farther than any of the others; and I pre&s;ume, that the thickne&s;s of their &s;hade prevented the moi&s;ture being exhaled, which cau&s;ed a kind of con&s;tant fermentation in the &s;oil. Hence, the ground appeared more hollow, moi&s;ter, and blacker, than between the drills at greater di&s;tances.</P>

<HEAD>OATS,</HEAD>
<P>Are a profitable and nece&s;&s;ary grain, and are principally recommended for hor&s;es, and commended for that u&s;e above all others, being of an opening nature.

If &s;own broad|ca&s;t, they mu&s;t be harrowed the &s;ame way as the furrows lie, if a lay, or but a very little acro&s;s, for fear of turning the turf; but upon an etch, as &s;oon as the land is plowed on an edge, &s;ow and harrow it in at once, and harrow it five or &s;ix times over, ob&s;erving to harrow once or twice acro&s;s, which breaks the clods, and covers the &s;eed better than harrowing all one way, they are in general &s;own after one plowing. Three bu&s;hels of &s;eed is the quantity for an acre. If they are

drilled, &s;ix inches between the rows is the be&s;t di&s;tance, and two bu&s;hels to an acre at lea&s;t, as oats will not tiller and &s;pread like other grain; they are ripe when the &s;talk turns yellow, the grain feels hard, and the hu&s;k begins to open and &s;hew the &s;eed. After they are cut, they &s;hould lie for the dew and rain to plump them, and make them thre&s;h well: and, if weedy, to dry the weeds; but if there happens much rain, they mu&s;t be got in as &s;oon as dry, otherwi&s;e the oats will &s;oon fall out of the hu&s;ks, and great part of the crop be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>This black oat is a hardy grain, and will bear a great deal of wet and cold. There is no land too rich, or too poor, too hot nor too cold for them.</P>
<P>The red oat is mo&s;t common in northern countries; it is a &s;ort of naked oat, and is ve|ry proper for making oat-meal, becau&s;e the kernel thre&s;hes out of the hull without car|rying it to the mill or drying of it. This oat is cultivated in the &s;ame manner as bar|ley.</P>
<P>The white oat is commonly &s;own on an etch, after wheat, rye or barley. The be&s;t method to prepare the land is, to plow in

<P>I have made &s;everal experiments in order to find the mo&s;t advantageous method of planting it. The following has exceeded all others.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="026198_0158_0FCF588B8B9341C0">I prepared my land by plowing it up in the fall of the year, in &s;ingle boughts; in the &s;pring I harrowed it down as &s;mooth as po&s;|&s;ible, and plowed it; then I harrowed it again, and marked out the furrows at eight feet di|&s;tance: in the&s;e furrows, I dropped the &s;eed &s;ingle, at about the di&s;tance of every foot&mdash; my cart loaded with manure from my com|po&s;t heap, followed in the alley between, and covered the &s;eed in the two furrows, about three or four inches thick, with the manure. This was done almo&s;t as expeditiou&s;ly as in the common way, covering it with mould by the hoe.</P>
<P>By this method, the plants came &s;oon up, and flouri&s;hed very vigorou&s;ly. When the plants were about &s;ix inches high, I plowed between, taking the mould from the plants, and throwed it up in a ridge in the middle of the alley; and with a hand hoe cut up the weeds and &s;uperfluous plants. If they are left at two feet di&s;tance in the rows they will be thick enough. The &s;tirring of the mould &s;o near the plants, makes them thrive and grow &s;urpri&s;ingly.</P>
<P>The next plowing, I took the mould from the middle, and throwed it up to the plants. Every time of plowing, I u&s;ed the hand hoe
<PB N="151" REF="026198_0159_0FD033C8674859C8">
to &s;tir the ground between the plants, and de&s;troy the weeds. The third plowing I did as the fir&s;t, throwing up the mould in the middle of the alley. This is of more u&s;e than a per&s;on would imagine; for it admits the influences of the air and nitrous dews to penetrate to the roots.</P>
<P>The fourth plowing, (which was the la&s;t) I managed as the &s;econd, by throwing up the mould to the &s;talks of corn.&mdash;If this la&s;t plowing could be &s;o contrived, as to be done early in the morning, before the &s;un has ex|aled the dew, it would bury tho&s;e riches in the ground which would afford a double nou|ri&s;hment.

<P>Clover gra&s;s hath been the name a great while, both for the great improvement it brings by its prodigious burthen, as al&s;o for its excellent &s;weetne&s;s both in gra&s;s and hay, and the riches with which it impreg|nates the ground, by the &s;talk and roots; the former by receiving the nitrous dews, which de&s;cend by them to the roots and ground about them; the latter al&s;o affords a &s;ort of dre&s;&s;ing to the ground after it is plowed up; and above all, &s;aves that expence which ma|ny are at yearly for weeding their ground,
<PB N="154" REF="026198_0162_0FCF5881140ABCC0">
which is by this gra&s;s entirely got under; and al&s;o the damage prevented that the grain ge|nerally &s;u&s;tains by the weeds growing among&s;t it: &s;o that it may be depended on, nothing better clears the ground of trumpery and weeds than a good crop of clover, as I have often experienced. It enriches and is of great &s;ervice to &s;tiff foils, either clay or loam by its deep and lateral roots opening and hollowing the ground, and will in that &s;ort of land, if it is in good heart, bring a ve|ry great crop; but in &s;ands or gravels, if a dry &s;ea&s;on, the crop will be very &s;hort, as it will burn.</P>
<P>The land for &s;owing this on, as well as all other &s;own gra&s;&s;es, &s;hould be made very fine, that is brought into a fine tilth, otherwi&s;e above half the &s;eed will be wa&s;ted. Fallow crops are be&s;t to prepare the land; turnips, potatoes and peas, I have found to be the be&s;t, and I have had better crops by &s;owing it by it&s;elf in Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>If it is &s;own with grain, &s;pring grain is the be&s;t; after the grain is up, &s;ow the clover &s;eed and roll it in, for that method new moulds the grain, and makes it grow amazingly, and then there is no danger of the clover

getting a head, and damaging the grain as is often the ca&s;e in wet &s;prings.</P>
<P>If you &s;ow it among your winter grain, it mu&s;t be &s;own in the &s;pring, and bu&s;h harrow it in; this method moulds the grain and co|vers the &s;eed.&mdash;The land in the &s;pring is often &s;ettled and baked hard, therefore there can|not be &s;o good a chance of having &s;o good a crop of gra&s;s with winter grain as with &s;pring. In the choice of this &s;eed, that which is of a bright yellow, with a good quantity of the purple and brown coloured, &s;eed among&s;t it; for that &s;hows the ripene&s;s of the &s;eed; when the white and light yellow coloured, is that which has not come to its full maturity, or not ripe. When it is thorough ripe, and well got in, the &s;eed will be good for five or &s;ix years. The quantity of good &s;eed to be &s;own per acre, is from &s;ix to ten pounds, ac|cording to the finene&s;s and richne&s;s of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>In May, or the beginning of June, this gra&s;s will be fit to cut, and there &s;hould be great care taken in making of it; for it will require a great deal more labour and time to dry than common gra&s;s, and will &s;hrink into le&s;s compa&s;s; but, if it be not too rank, it will make extraordinary rich food for cattle.
<PB N="156" REF="026198_0164_0FCF58835D155FA0">
The time for cutting it is when it begins to flower; for if it &s;tands much longer, the lower parts of the &s;tems will begin to dry, where|by it will make a le&s;s quantity of hay, and that not &s;o well flavoured.</P>
<P>I have cut three crops of this gra&s;s &s;ome years; but the be&s;t way is to cut it once in the &s;pring, and feed it the remaining part of the year, whereby the land will be enriched, and the plants will grow much &s;tronger.</P>
<P>One acre of this gra&s;s (if a good crop,) will feed as many cattle as three or four of com|mon gra&s;s; but great care mu&s;t be taken of the cattle when they are fir&s;t put into it, le&s;t it hoves and bur&s;ts them: to prevent which the be&s;t method is, before they are turned in to eat it, let them fill their bellies with &s;ome other food, and at fir&s;t turn them in only for a few hours, and &s;tint them as to quantity; and this by degrees, letting them fir&s;t be in the middle of the day, when there is no moi&s;ture on the gra&s;s, and &s;o every day, &s;uffering them to remain a longer time, until they are fully &s;ea&s;oned to it: but great care &s;hould be taken never to turn them into this food in wet wea|ther; or, if they have been for &s;ome time accu&s;tomed to this food, it will be proper to turn them out at night in wet weather, and
<PB N="157" REF="026198_0165_0FD033D81ABF0008">
let them have hay or &s;traw, which will pre|vent the ill con&s;equences of this food.</P>
<P>The be&s;t method of making clover hay, I have found to be thus:&mdash;after it is mowed, put it up with the fork or rake in little &s;epa|rate parcels, about the bigne&s;s of a bu&s;hel, then turn it bottom upwards &s;everal times, till it is made; &s;o that you never &s;eparate it till it be carted home; by this means the leaf and flower is kept on, which otherwi&s;e would be mo&s;tly lo&s;t, which is the be&s;t part of the hay.</P>
<P>If clover is kept for &s;eed, and it is a fa|vourable &s;ea&s;on, you may have two crops; but in general there is but one crop &s;aved, and that is the &s;econd, as it grows more even and has le&s;s weeds in it than the fir&s;t. When it is kept for &s;eed, it mu&s;t &s;tand till the heads are very brown, and full ripe, which may be known by rubbing them between your hands. I have had from two crops of &s;eed in one &s;ea|&s;on, upwards of &s;ix bu&s;hels on an acre, and from one crop near four bu&s;hels. It is a &s;eed that is hard to get out by thre&s;hing, therefore the &s;pring is the be&s;t time for this work when
<PB N="158" REF="026198_0166_0FD033E02B142AF0">
the drying winds blow, which &s;hould be let into the barn as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I have made experiments to know the pro|fits of a clover crop; the fir&s;t was as follows: Six acres of clover I cut, and fed cattle in racks, from the latter end of April, to the latter end of October following, which main|tained ten oxen, thirteen cows, three hor&s;es, and twenty-&s;ix hogs; which after the rate of 2s. per week for each kine and hor&s;e, and 4d. per week for each hog, which came to 3l. 1s. 6d. 1-2, or 80l. for twenty-&s;ix weeks. The &s;ummer profit then of each acre was 13l. 6s. 8d. be&s;ides the latter-math.</P>
<P>The next experiment was on four acres of clover, which I let go to &s;eed. At twice mowing I had twelve tons of hay and twen|ty four bu&s;hels and a half of &s;eed. The hay was not near &s;o good as if it had been cut green, therefore I allowed it to be worth on|ly 2l. per ton. The clover &s;eed I &s;old for 50s. per bu&s;hel, &s;o that the amount of the produce of the four acres was 85l. 5s. or 21l. 6s. 3d. per acre. When a clover lay is plow|ed up, if the land is not rich or in good heart, it is an excellent method to plow in the la&s;t crop, and you may depend on having a good

<P>Lands naturally kind for grain, and unkind for common gra&s;s, are undoubtedly kind for trefoil; and though it be much impover|i&s;hed by long &s;owing, that it will bear grain no longer, it will bring a crop of this gra&s;s. Experience convinces me that it will grow in any &s;oil: even rocky, hilly, or gravelly ground, of a very &s;mall value, may be impro|ved by this gra&s;s; but if the land be a clay, and it lays wet, it mu&s;t be drained and made as dry as you can.</P>
<P>That the pa&s;ture is as good and better on trefoil than clover, for cattle, and e&s;pecially cows; for it will not only cau&s;e them to give more milk in quantity, but better in quality, and al&s;o makes butter and chee&s;e of a delicate

yellow colour. The hay thereof is nouri&s;hing and makes oxen and other cattle as fat as any other hay, if it be made in good &s;ea&s;on, that is, whil&s;t it is full of yellow blo&s;&s;oms, and not over dry (for it is &s;oon made.) It does not loo&s;e its colour, or &s;hrink in making, as clover gra&s;s does; but is much finer, green|er, and in all points better than clover is. It is particularly good for fattening of ewes and lambs, and free from breeding rottenne&s;s, which other pa&s;tures are apt to do. And as clover makes &s;ick and kills many cattle, this is free from any &s;uch danger; the cattle are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of it, that where they are &s;own to|gether, they will not touch the clover, till they have eat the trefoil bare.</P>
<P>Trefoil will endure much longer than clo|ver, if it &s;tands not for &s;eed; for that is de|&s;tructive to the root; becau&s;e being cut in the heat of &s;ummer, the heat draws out the &s;ap which &s;hould nouri&s;h it.</P>
<P>The crop is not &s;o bulky as clover, but the many good qualities enumerated as above, makes it a beneficial crop.

upon an acre of land will depend wholly on the goodne&s;s of it; for there is &s;ome &s;eed, of which not one in ten will &s;trike; whereas, in good &s;eed, not one in twenty will fail. The method of knowing the goodne&s;s, is by &s;ow|ing a certain number of the &s;eeds, and &s;eeing how many plants are produced by them. If it is above two years old, it will not grow. The external &s;igns of the &s;eeds being good, are, that the hu&s;k is of a bright colour rather of a purple, and the kernel plump, of a light grey or blue colour. If the kernel be cut acro&s;s, and appear greeni&s;h and fre&s;h, it is a certain &s;ign it is good. If be of a yellowi&s;h colour, and friable, and looks thin and pitted, it is a bad &s;ign. The quantity of &s;eed allow|ed to the acre in the drill way, is much le&s;s than by &s;owing broad-ca&s;t. A bu&s;hel of &s;eed to an acre of land, is 20 &s;eeds to eack &s;quare foot of land if &s;own broad-ca&s;t, which would be &s;ufficient; but there mu&s;t be an allowance made for ca&s;ualties.</P>
<P>The quantity of good &s;eed I have found by experience is, for &s;owing broad-ca&s;t, two bu&s;hels, and for drilling, one bu&s;hel. And as the &s;aintfoin does not cover all the ground the fir&s;t year, which &s;paces are generally oc|cupied by weeds; to remedy this, when I have &s;own it broad ca&s;t, I have &s;own four or
<PB N="165" REF="026198_0173_0FD033F6DF9BC048">
five pounds of clover &s;eed with it to the acre, which has an&s;wered a very good purpo&s;e, as I have then had a crop the fir&s;t year.</P>
<P>The Saintfoin is but a &s;low grower at fir&s;t, the &s;econd year perhaps will not exceed a clo|ver crop, but afterwards it increa&s;es every year, for &s;ix or &s;even years before it comes to its full perfection; and as that increa&s;es, the clover goes off, and makes room for it.</P>
<P>This valuable plant will keep in perfecti|on for twenty years, if you only give it a &s;light top dre&s;&s;ing with &s;oot or a&s;hes, once in four or five years. The fir&s;t &s;ummer, nor early the next &s;pring, it &s;hould not be fed, becau&s;e it will be apt to bleed it&s;elf to death: for the &s;weetne&s;s of it is &s;uch, that it will en|tice cattle to bite into the knot in the ground and &s;poil it; but afterwards, when it has ga|thered &s;trength, the be&s;t method will be to mow the fir&s;t crop, and feed it after, which is excellent for cows and &s;heep.</P>
<P>This plant, as well as trefoil, will not thrive in a wet moi&s;t &s;oil; and as &s;aintfoin thrives be&s;t on high grounds, it is a great ad|vantage in the article of making it into hay, as it has greatly more advantage of the &s;un, and le&s;s to fear of mi&s;chief from wet, than
<PB N="166" REF="026198_0174_0FCF588D09164B40">
gra&s;s which grows in low grounds.&mdash;On the high grounds, the wind will dry more in an hour, than it will in meadows that lie low, in a whole day; and often the crops of &s;aint|foin make a very good hay in the &s;ame &s;ea|&s;ons in which all the gra&s;s hay is &s;poiled. The &s;un on the high grounds has al&s;o a more be|nign influence, and &s;ends off the dew there, two hours earlier in the morning, and holds it up as much longer in the evening; by the&s;e advantages, the &s;aintfoin has more time to dry, and is made with half the expence of common hay.</P>
<P>Saintfoin for hay, &s;hould be cut when it is half blo&s;&s;omed, and managed the &s;ame, as before directed for clover. If &s;aved for &s;eed, it mu&s;t be the fir&s;t cutting. You may know when it is ripe by the &s;eeds coming out ea&s;ily in your hand; dry it in the field, and thre&s;h it there on a cloth, as it will &s;hed, and you will loo&s;e great part of the &s;eed if you carry it to the barn. The &s;traw will be as good as hay for hor&s;es; and the hay, when it has been well got in, my hor&s;es that have worked hard, have been kept on it alone without any grain, have been &s;o fond of it that they have refu&s;ed beans and oats mixed with chaff in the common way for it.

<HEAD>LUCERNE,</HEAD>
<P>Is the &s;ame plant which the ancients were &s;o fond of, under the name of Medica, and in the culture of which they be&s;towed &s;uch great care and pains. Its leaves grow three at a joint, like tho&s;e of the clover; its flow|ers are blue, and its pods of a &s;crew like &s;hape, containing &s;eeds like tho&s;e of the red clover, but longer, and more kidney &s;haped, and the colour all yellow. The &s;talks grow erect, and, after mowing, they immediately grow up again from the parts where they were cut off. The roots are longer than the &s;aintfoin, and are not &s;ingle, but &s;ome times they run perpendicularly, in three or four places from the crown.</P>
<P>It is the only plant in the world, who&s;e hay is equal to the &s;aintfoin for the fattening

of cattle; but its virtues in that re&s;pect are very great. It is the &s;weete&s;t gra&s;s in the world, but mu&s;t be given to cattle with cau|tion, and in &s;mall quantities, otherwi&s;e they will &s;well, and incur di&s;ea&s;es from it.</P>
<P>Though the common methods of hu&s;band|ry will not rai&s;e lucerne to any great advan|tage, yet the drilling and the hor&s;e-hoe hu&s;|bandry will rai&s;e it, annually increa&s;ing in value to the owner, and make one of the mo&s;t profitable articles of his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;oil to plant it on, mu&s;t be either a hot gravel, or a very rich and dry land, that has not an under &s;tratum of clay, and is not too near &s;prings of water. The natural poorne&s;s of gravel or &s;and, may be made up by dung, and the benefit of the hoe, and the natural richne&s;s of the other lands, being increa&s;|ed by howing and clean&s;ing from gra&s;s, the lucerne will thrive with le&s;s heat; for what is wanted in one of tho&s;e qualities, mu&s;t be made up in the other.</P>
<P>The be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for planting of it is early in the &s;pring, the earlier the better; for then there is always moi&s;ture enough in the earth to make it grow, and not &s;o much heat as would dry up its tender roots, and kill it

<P>The planting it in autumn, in &s;ome cli|mates, might do; but here the winters are too cold, which would kill great part of the tender plants, and greatly &s;tunt and injure tho&s;e it does not kill. The number of the lu|cerne plants &s;hould be le&s;s than tho&s;e of &s;aint|foin, to an acre, becau&s;e they grow much larger in this way of management, and each occupies a greater &s;pace of ground, and pro|duces a larger quantity of hay.</P>
<P>The quick growth of this plant, requires that it &s;hould have large &s;upplies of nouri&s;h|ment, and good room to grow in; and it is better in all things of this kind to err in &s;etting the plants too far di&s;tant, than in &s;etting them too near.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t fatal di&s;ea&s;es incident to lucern, are &s;tarving and &s;mothering; for this rea&s;on, good cultivation is nece&s;&s;ary to it, and the of|ten turning the earth with the hoe all about it. By this means, a plant, that in the com|mon way of &s;owing, would not have been more than eight or nine inches high, will be four or five feet, and will &s;pread every way,

But lucern &s;own in drills &s;o near, will in a few years, meet in the rows, which will hinder the mould be|ing &s;tirred, when it will &s;tarve for want of nouri&s;hment, and thereby wear out.</P>
<P>Lucern is of much quicker growth than &s;aintfoin, or any other gra&s;s. I have cut it four times in a &s;ea&s;on; whereas the others are &s;eldom cut above twice.</P>

<P>In the vales, their way of cleaning wheat and other grains, is very different from theirs in the hills; the former following their anci|ent way of wind-fanning it; the latter, by throwing it, which is done with as much ex|pedition and with fewer hands.</P>
<P>Their hedging in the low countries varies much from that of the high lands; in the low countries they cut half the &s;ide of the hedge for fuel, and leave the other half for fence: but in the hilly countries they plai&s;h all that is left, and make a &s;ort of a wall-hedge, about four feet high from the ground, which makes an excellent fence, far exceeding the other.</P>
<P>In the vales, their wheat and beans are larger bodied than tho&s;e on the hills, by rea|&s;on of their excellent, &s;trong black &s;oils; but their barley and oats are not &s;o good, becau&s;e their ground is &s;o rank as runs them mo&s;tly into &s;traw, and le&s;s into grain, that often lays them flat to the ground, by the greatne&s;s of their bulk, and then it is generally lean, poor grain.</P>

<HEAD>FEEDING AND FATTENING SHEEP ON TURNIPS.</HEAD>
<P>Feeding &s;heep with turnips is of great ad|vantage to the farmer, as they &s;oon fatten on them, and their dung is of great &s;ervice to the land; and it would likewi&s;e be a national be|nefit, if it was made a common practi&s;e of, as in Great-Britain; for by this method there might be a hundred &s;heep kept on a &s;mall plantation, where now they have not above ten.</P>
<P>The meat that is fatted with turnips, is &s;u|perior in flavour to that fattened on the be&s;t meadows; and by the increa&s;e of the &s;tock, our wool would be &s;ufficient for our manu|factories, which at pre&s;ent the greate&s;t part we are obliged to import.</P>
<P>In Great-Britain, they reckon turnips the ba&s;is of agriculture: therefore if a farmer there keeps no &s;heep, they predict his de&s;ti|ny.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="026198_0195_0FCF58AA451E3228">There is &s;ome difficulty at fir&s;t to make &s;heep that has not been u&s;ed to them, eat them; they will &s;ometimes fa&s;t two or three days; but after they have ta&s;ted them, they devour them voraciou&s;ly&mdash;the young lambe fall to at once.</P>
<P>To turn a flock of &s;heep at large into a field of turnips, would be very di&s;advantageous, for they would de&s;troy as many in a fortnight as would keep them the whole winter.</P>
<P>There are three other ways of feeding them on this food, all of which have their &s;e|veral advantages. The fir&s;t way is to divide the land by hurdles, (a de&s;cription of which I &s;hall give hereafter) and allow the weathers, ewes and lambs you intend to fatten, to come upon &s;uch a portion only at a time, as they can eat in one day, and &s;o advance the hur|dles further into the ground daily, till all be eaten. They will eat the tops, and &s;coop out the middle of the turnip; what is left, the bottoms and out &s;ides, &s;hould be picked up with an iron crook, and given to your &s;tore &s;heep, which may follow tho&s;e you are fattening, and they will eat all clean up.</P>
<P>The &s;econd way is by enclo&s;ing the &s;heep in hurdles as before; but to pull up the tur|nips
<PB N="188" REF="026198_0196_0FD0342CD8DB1920">
you &s;uppo&s;e the &s;heep can eat in one day, and &s;o on till all be eaten.</P>
<P>The third manner is to pull up the turnips, and remove them in a cart or waggon to &s;ome other place, &s;preading them on a fre&s;h place every day; by this method the &s;heep will eat them up clean, both roots and leaves. The great advantage of this method is when there is land not far off that wants dung more than that where the turnips grow, which perhaps is al&s;o too wet for the &s;heep in winter. The expence of hurdles, and the trouble of mov|ing them, is &s;aved in this ca&s;e, which will counterbalance at lea&s;t the expence of pul|ling and carting the turnips.</P>
<P>There is one caution nece&s;&s;ary, that is, to hou&s;e or bury a quantity of turnips, in ca&s;e it &s;hould happen to be a &s;evere winter, that your &s;tock may not &s;uffer. I have frequent|ly ob&s;erved, when the &s;now has been a foot high, that the &s;heep have &s;craped off the &s;now, and found the turnips.</P>

<HEAD>For making the hurdles, and placing of them; with the benefit received by the &s;heep's dung and urine.</HEAD>
<P>The hurdles are made of thin light poles, &s;plit in two, any wood will do that will rend ea&s;y; the common length of the hurdle is eight feet; it is made like a gate, with five bars or &s;lotes. There are two ends morti&s;ed, that the ends of the bars, or &s;lotes go into: the feet of tho&s;e ends are eighteen inches long, cut peaked or &s;harp to go into the ground: then there is a flat piece that is nailed to the bars right in the middle horizontally, and two other flat pieces which are al&s;o nailed to the bars, in a &s;loping manner as ties; they go from the feet on each &s;ide up to the top of that piece nailed in the middle, which keeps the hurdle from rakeing. The height of the hurdle is four feet; if they are made of light &s;tuff, a man can carry four of them. For placing of them, there are holes made in the ground with a &s;harp iron crow, for receiving the feet of the hurdle, which is drove down with a wood-maul, and the ends are fa&s;tened together with withes: for fifty &s;heep, place
<PB N="190" REF="026198_0198_0FD02C9EAC4311E8">
five hurdles on every &s;ide, &s;o that forty feet &s;quare will be &s;o taken in, and &s;o in propor|tion according to the flock. A man, when he has been u&s;ed to this work, will re|move one of the&s;e pens in an hour.</P>
<P>There are many other benefits received by folding of &s;heep exclu&s;ive of feeding off the turnips. In many parts of England they fold upon their wheat. Every day they plow for wheat, they &s;ow broad-ca&s;t and har|row it in. Their flock every night is brought from the pa&s;ture and folded on it: the &s;heep tread the ground down firm that it does not &s;pew out in the winter, and their manure makes it grow vigorou&s;ly, that they have ge|nerally great crops.</P>
<P>Sheeps dung is one of the be&s;t manures I know of. It &s;ucceeds upon all &s;orts of lands; but as it is not &s;o conveniently collected as the dung of larger animals, it is commonly conveyed to the land it is intended for, by folding the &s;heep upon it. The urine as well as the dung, is thus given to the land, and is of great advantage.</P>
<P>In Flanders, they make many thou&s;and loads of manure annually from their &s;heep: they cover the bottom of the folds con&s;idera|bly
<PB N="191" REF="026198_0199_0FD02CA2ED6B1EF8">
deep with &s;ome light and &s;pungy earth, and when this has received the dung and urine of the animals for &s;even or eight days, they remove it and lay fre&s;h in its place: the earth thus impregnated, becomes an excel|lent improvement to land, and they rai&s;e large crops by means of it, in places where very little could be expected without it. I have my&s;elf had contrivances &s;omething like it, which was covering the bottoms of the folds deep with &s;and, and changing it once a week; which I found was an excellent dre&s;&s;ing for my clayey lands; both the &s;and and this peculiar kind of dung being appro|priated things for it.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>MANGEL WURZEL;</HI> or, <HI>ROOT OF SCARCITY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This root is a native of Germany, from whence it took its name Mangel Wurzel, or root of &s;carcity. Its cultivation in that coun|try is great, for the u&s;e of all &s;orts of cattle, as
<PB N="192" REF="026198_0200_0FCF580854368B98">
well as for culinary u&s;es. It was introduced into France, and from thence to England by that ingenious horticulturi&s;t, John Coakley Lett&s;om, who&s;e laudable endeavours to en|courage the growth of &s;o valuable a root, did not meet with that encouragement it de&s;erv|ed, as it interfered with the profits and inte|re&s;ts of &s;ome oppulent gardeners, who would at any time &s;acrifice the public good to their own private emolument.</P>
<P>What makes this plant more valuable is, that every part of it is edible and &s;alutary; and be&s;ides allowing nutritious fodder for cat|tle, affords a &s;upply for the table both in &s;um|mer and winter. The leaves exceed &s;pinach, and the roots tho&s;e of par&s;nips. The &s;talks and ribs of the large leaves, dive&s;ted of the leafy part, and peeled, eat like a&s;paragus; or may be u&s;ed in &s;oups, which they greatly im|prove. The leaves tied up in a bag or net, with &s;lices of meat interlaid and boiled, make a di&s;h both plea&s;ant and &s;alutary; or with plumbs, dam&s;ons, &s;liced apples, quinces, &amp;c. afford a diet that is highly e&s;teemed by ma|ny.</P>
<P>This root ought not to be put into the cla&s;s with turnips, or carrots, although by its ex|ternal appearance, and its &s;eed, it very much
<PB N="193" REF="026198_0201_0FD02CA4132D2630">
re&s;embles the beet root; it is &s;uperior to it in every re&s;pect, and appears to form a di&s;tinct &s;pecies. Its culture is &s;o ea&s;y, its advanta|ges &s;o numerous, and it will an&s;wer &s;o com|pletely the purpo&s;es of any other fodder, that it &s;eems to me to de&s;erve to be adopted every where, and to have the preference even in the be&s;t years, over all other roots with which bea&s;ts are nouri&s;hed. It will grow in all climates and &s;oils. Tho&s;e lands that are moi&s;t and light are mo&s;t &s;uitable. If in hard and clayey grounds, it is prevented from ma|king its way far into the earth, it will extend it&s;elf horizontally, and will produce above the &s;urface that which the nature of the &s;oil hinders from being produced beneath it.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t valuable root is not affected by the vici&s;&s;itudes of the &s;ea&s;ons, and has no de|&s;tructive enemy; the in&s;ects and vermin which make ravages on all other kinds of ve|getables, neither touch nor injure it. It is not attacked by bla&s;ting or mildew, and the greate&s;t drought does not affect its vegetation; it does not injure the &s;oil that nouri&s;hes it; but prepares it to receive, before the winter, the grain and other &s;eeds that are intended to be depo&s;ited in it.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="026198_0202_0FD02CA57AC3F200">The time of &s;owing the &s;eed is in April or the beginning of May; let the land be well prepared by plowing, and manured, and made light; &s;teep the &s;eeds in water twenty-four hours; lay the line upon the field, and plant the &s;eeds at eighteen inches apart every way; you may &s;et them with a &s;tick, but they mu&s;t not be buried above one inch deep. Af|ter ten or twelve days, it will be up, and eve|ry grain will have from two to four roots growing together. As &s;oon as the&s;e &s;mall roots &s;hew their fourth leaf, the feeble&s;t of them mu&s;t be carefully plucked off, and the fine&s;t and mo&s;t vigorous root only left.</P>
<P>In a little time the growth of the roots thus &s;elected will be a&s;toni&s;hing; not one will fail.</P>
<P>As the roots naturally grow a little above the ground, notice tho&s;e which do not &s;o appear, and bare them by removing the earth from around their top; they mu&s;t be hoed and kept clean from weeds.</P>
<P>In July, when the outward leaves are be|come about a foot long, the fir&s;t crop of leaves is to be gathered, breaking them off round and near the root. For this purpo&s;e, the thumb &s;hould be placed within, and at the

origin of the leaves, in order to &s;trip them off, clo&s;e to their in&s;ertion into the &s;tem. Tho&s;e leaves only &s;hould be gathered which bend towards the earth, and care &s;hould always be taken to leave tho&s;e of the heart of the plant: they will thereby be reproduced, and grow more quickly.</P>
<P>Immediately after this fir&s;t crop, the ground &s;hould be &s;tirred. It is from this moment that the roots begin to grow large, and to in|crea&s;e in an a&s;toni&s;hing manner. In good land the leaves may be plucked off every fort|night or three weeks.</P>
<P>The commencement of &s;harp fro&s;ts deter|mines the time of the crops of the&s;e roots: a fine day mu&s;t be cho&s;en for gathering them in, as it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be got in dry. I have had the roots average &s;even pounds each on an acre. Which produce was fourteen tuns and an half per acre, and the leaves I reckoned weighed as much, which was twenty-nine tun of excellent food for cattle, from one acre of land.</P>
<P>In order to cau&s;e the&s;e roots and leaves to be eaten by all kinds of cattle, it is nece&s;&s;ary to cut them in &s;mall pieces, after having well wa&s;hed and clean&s;ed the roots. I employed
<PB N="196" REF="026198_0204_0FCF583A883A4320">

This operation was performed in a trough made for that purpo&s;e. A man may in one hour's time cut into &s;mall pieces a quantity of roots, &s;ufficient for the nouri&s;h|ment of twelve oxen for a day. Before the roots are ca&s;t into the trough, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;plit them, and cut them into quarters.</P>
<P>For horned cattle prepared in this manner, the&s;e roots, or leaves may be given, without any mixture; but if you want to hu&s;band the roots, you may mix one quarter of chaff with it cut from the hay of trefoil, lucern, &s;aintfoin, or clover.</P>
<P>For hor&s;es during the &s;ummer, they may be fed with the leaves chopped, and mixed half with chopped hay, the &s;ame as before mentioned, and in the winter with the roots and hay cut in the &s;ame manner.</P>

<P>The principal u&s;e of hops is well known to con&s;i&s;t in pre&s;erving beer from growing &s;our, and to make it keep a long time. Hops boiled in the wort al&s;o makes the beer whole|&s;omer and more grateful to the ta&s;te, as they communicate to it a diuretic virtue, to purge the blood, and is good for the jaundice and hypochondriac affections. And as it is ex|pected that beer will be the common and ge|neral drink of this country, I would advi&s;e tho&s;e who are in a capacity, to make plan|tations as &s;oon as they can.</P>
<P>There are four &s;orts of hops, the wild gar|lic hop, the long and &s;quare garlic hop, the
<PB N="198" REF="026198_0206_0FCF580D8216B2D0">
oval hop, and the long white hop: the two former are not worth propagating; the lat|ter is more fertile and beautiful.</P>
<P>Any &s;oil, except &s;tony, rocky, and &s;tiff clay will &s;uit them; the be&s;t however, is that which is light, deep, and rich, and the bet|ter for &s;and being mixed with it: a black garden mould is excellent. An open &s;ituati|on to the &s;outh-ea&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t points agree be&s;t with hops, if they are defended with trees planted on the ea&s;t, north and we&s;t &s;ides the better. The &s;ets may be planted in the fall or early in the &s;pring, either in October, March or the beginning of April: as the &s;ea&s;on and climate &s;uits. The di&s;tance of the hills in dry hot ground may be &s;ix feet; but in moi&s;t and rich ground eight feet.</P>
<P>The large&s;t &s;ets are to be cho&s;en from &s;e|ven to ten inches long, with three or four joints each. The&s;e are to be &s;et in holes about fourteen inches over, and at each cor|ner of the hole and a fifth in the middle, rai&s;|ing the earth two or three inches about, leaving two or three joints above the ground.</P>
<P>If the ground be poor, or &s;tiff, &s;ome good mould, or a compo&s;t of manure and earth
<PB N="199" REF="026198_0207_0FD02CAC3553C390">
mu&s;t be laid in the holes, and it is a great expence and trouble in watering of them, that may be &s;aved by putting in the bottom of the hole &s;ome hor&s;e litter or &s;traw, and covering it with mould in the &s;hape of a ba&s;on. In the &s;ummer keep all weeds, between clear with the hoe, and about June twi&s;t them to|gether, and let them lie, that they may not bear the fir&s;t year, by which means the plants will be much &s;tronger. To make good &s;uch lo&s;t time, you may plant the inter&s;paces with garden beans.</P>
<P>In November, either dig or plow tho&s;e in|ter&s;paces, and give the land a dre&s;&s;ing of rot|ten dung, cutting the hop vines down to the earth, covering them with fat mould. In March, the &s;econd year, if the weather will permit, open the hills and cut away all the new &s;uckers, then pole them with twelve feet poles; the third year they are in full perfec|tion, and will la&s;t about twenty years; one pole will do for the fir&s;t year you pole them, but afterwards they mu&s;t have three poles to a hill, twenty feet long; but do not pole till the &s;hoots are ten inches high, making fir&s;t a hole with an iron crow to put the poles in, that mu&s;t be cut three &s;quare at their ends.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="026198_0208_0FD02CADA0C071F8">When the vines are about three feet, and all are not taken to the poles, guide the re&s;t to them, and tie them with withered ru&s;hes or yarn to the empty poles, and at a proper di&s;tance therefrom, but not &s;o clo&s;e tied as to hinder their climbing; two or three &s;trings are &s;ufficient for a pole. The poles are to lean outwards, particularly towards the &s;outh, to receive the &s;un's beams; it being ob&s;erv|ed, that a leaning pole will bear more hops than an upright one.</P>
<P>About mid-&s;ummer, when the hop begins to branch out, &s;uch as have not got up to the tops of the poles, &s;hould have their heads nipt off, or el&s;e diverted from the pole, in order to branch the better, for the increa&s;e of the hop. They blow in July, and are ripe in Augu&s;t: their ripene&s;s is known by their fragrancy, change of colour, by being ea&s;ily pulled, and by the browni&s;h colour of the &s;eed.</P>
<P>Hops &s;hould be gathered when &s;omewhat browni&s;h, and that without delay. In order to this, make a frame with four &s;hort poles or &s;ticks, laid on four forks driven into the ground, to contain a hair cloth, or blanket tacked round it about the edges. On this de|vice, the poles with the hops may be laid,
<PB N="201" REF="026198_0209_0FCF580F0FFB52E8">
and at each &s;ide the pickers may &s;tand and pick the hops into it. When the blanket or hair-cloth is full, untack and carry it away, and place it, when emptied, into the &s;ame frame again; and this frame may be remov|ed to &s;ome new place of the garden.</P>
<P>Hops &s;hould not be gathered when wet; but if dew or rain be on them, &s;hake the poles, and they will dry the &s;ooner. As fa&s;t as the hops are picked, they mu&s;t be dried. The general expeditious way of drying hops, is by the kiln, which extracts their humidity in a little time; but then &s;uch violence is not &s;o natural as the heat of the &s;un, that is the be&s;t of all other ways, where conveniency will allow; for the &s;pirituous parts of this plant are &s;o nice, that it cannot endure any violent heat without prejudice to its fine virtues, that are of a friendly, opening quality, when its aromatick, &s;ubtle &s;pirits are thus mo&s;tly kept in.</P>
<P>If they are kiln dried, the common one in a hair-cloth is not &s;o proper as one made of a bed of flat ledges, an inch thick, and two or three inches broad, &s;awn and laid acro&s;s each other, chequer ways, the flat way, about three inches di&s;tant; the ledges &s;o entered, are put into another, that the floor may be even and

&s;mooth: this bed may re&s;t on two or three joi&s;ts, &s;et edgeways; then covered with large double tin plates &s;oldered together at each joint, and order the ledges &s;o, before they are laid, that the joints of the tin may always lie over the middle of a ledge: then fit boards about the edges of the kiln, to keep up the hops, only let one &s;ide be to remove for &s;hoving off the hops. They may be very &s;afely turned on this tin bed, and with a &s;mall expence of fuel; be&s;ides, any manner of fu|el will &s;erve for this purpo&s;e, the &s;moke not pa&s;&s;ing through the hops, but conveyances made for it, at the &s;everal corners of the kiln.</P>
<P>After hops have lain a month to cool and toughen, in order to bag them, there is a round or &s;quare hole made in an upper floor, big enough for a man to turn him&s;elf in; then tack a hoop about the mouth of the bag fa&s;t with pack thread, &s;o as to bear the weight of the hops and the man that treads them; that done, let the bag down through the hole; the hoop above will keep it from &s;liding quite through. Fir&s;t tie a handful of hops at each lower corner, with pack thread, to &s;erve as a ta&s;&s;el, for conveniently moving the bag; then go into the bag, and tread the hops on every &s;ide, another &s;till ca&s;ting in the hops as fa&s;t as you require, till it be full; when it is well trodden and full, let the bag down by

unripping the hoop, and clo&s;e the mouth of the bag, filling the two upper corners as you did the lower. This bag, if well packed and dryed will keep &s;everal years in a dry place; only care mu&s;t be taken that the mice do not make their ne&s;ts in the hops.</P>
<P>The profits of a hop-garden per acre, if the blight and fly does not take them, is from thirty to fifty pounds.</P>

<HEAD>How to manage the <HI>KITCHEN</HI> and FLOWER GARDEN.</HEAD>
<P>Some ingenious men have hinted to me that they would wi&s;h me to give a botanical de&s;cription of herbaceous plants and flowers in the Linnaean &s;y&s;tem, (which I conceive my&s;elf fully capable) and &s;hould have been happy if I could have obliged my curious patrons; but it would have &s;welled my work far beyond its limits; and when I con&s;ider that my treati&s;e is chiefly intended for the farmer, who has not time to &s;tudy &s;o labo|rious a &s;cience, which is not like an unactive and &s;edentary &s;cience, like geometry or hi|&s;tory that may be acquired by a reclu&s;e and &s;olitary application, within the narrow pre|cincts
<PB N="204" REF="026198_0212_0FD0320DECF61DD8">
of a clo&s;et; or, like chemi&s;try, anato|my, and a&s;tronomy, requiring only &s;uch ope|rations as may be performed without a great deal of exerci&s;e, toil and fatigue.</P>
<P>The botani&s;t mu&s;t wander over mountains and vallies, range the gloomy fore&s;ts and wil|derne&s;s, climb the &s;teepe&s;t rocks, and expo&s;e his life to the brinks of hideous precipices, in que&s;t of knowledge.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore confine my&s;elf at pre&s;ent, to the cultivation and management of the mo&s;t u&s;eful vegetables for the table, and herbs for the hou&s;e, with the&s;e flowers that will re|quire the lea&s;t trouble.</P>
<P>To the curious in botany, I recommend the peru&s;al of &s;ome of the be&s;t authors on that &s;cience, which are Boerhaave, Grew, Bradley, Miller, Dillenius, Linnaeus, and Sir Hans Sloane.</P>
<P>Mr. Humphry Mar&s;hall has given a very good de&s;cription in the Linnaean &s;y&s;tem of fore&s;t trees, and &s;hrubs, natives of this country, and promi&s;ed in the introduction to his work, that if the work then publi&s;hed, met with the encouragement of the public, he would al&s;o treat on our native herbaceous
<PB N="205" REF="026198_0213_0FCF5812C9A04F48">
plants. By his &s;ilence I fear his work did not meet with that encouragement it de&s;erv|ed. I hope I &s;hall never find this country &s;tigmatized for not giving encouragement to merit, and genius.</P>
<P>I have only to &s;ay (like Mar&s;hall) if this pre&s;ent work meets with encouragement, in my next edition, I &s;hall add many u&s;eful and intere&s;ting &s;ubjects, particularly in agricul|ture, horticulture and botany.</P>
<P>The introduction of many foreign &s;hrubs and plants into this county, will be of parti|cular benefit. The diver&s;ity of climate and &s;oil here, will &s;uit any of them. The vine, the almond and fig-tree will grow as well here, and be as productive as in France, Por|tugal or Spain; only give them proper culti|tivation. So will liquorice, rhubarb, madder, and many other foreign u&s;eful &s;hrubs and plants.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to give directions for managing the kitchen and flower garden, but &s;hall not treat this &s;ubject as mo&s;t authors have on that &s;cience, beginning the calendar January and &s;o on; for the &s;ea&s;ons are dif|ferent in this country in the different &s;tates. My intention is chiefly intended for the bene|fit

of the farmer: therefore &s;hall begin with the proper &s;ea&s;ons for &s;owing the &s;eeds, and &s;econdly, how to tran&s;plant and manage them.</P>
<P>It is fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the ground to receive the &s;eeds and plants, which is be&s;t done by digging it up in the fall of the year, and laying it up in ridges, which is done by trenching; this meliorates the earth, and then it requires but little labour to make it fit for &s;owing, and planting, which is done by throw|ing the ridges into the trenches and levelling of it; this will enable you to take the fir&s;t opportunity in the &s;pring, whereby you will be able to get early crops, be&s;ides having your ground mellow, which will make the &s;eeds vegetate in half the time.</P>
<P>To the Southward they have the advan|tage over the colder parts, as many of their &s;eeds may be &s;own in the fall of the year as they will &s;tand the winter, &s;uch as cabbage, colliflower, &s;pinach, onions, lettuce, endive, radi&s;hes, peas, beans, &amp;c. but where the fro&s;t is &s;evere, the&s;e mu&s;t be &s;own early in the &s;pring.</P>

And as &s;ome of tho&s;e plants require particular management, I &s;hall here give proper directions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, a&s;paragus, is a fine vegetable. In making plantations of the&s;e plants, one great article to be con&s;idered, is, to make choice of a proper &s;oil; choo&s;e the be&s;t the garden af|fords; it mu&s;t not be wet, nor too &s;trong or &s;tubborn, but &s;uch as is moderately light and pliable, &s;o as it will readily fall to pieces in digging and raking, and in a &s;ituation that en|joys the full &s;un.</P>
<P>The ground where you intend to make a&s;paragus beds, &s;hould be regularly trench|ed, and a large quantity of good rotten dung buried equally in each trench, at lea&s;t twelve or fifteen inches below the &s;urface of the dug ground. The ground being dug and laid le|vel, divide it into beds four feet and an half wide, with alleys two feet wide between bed and bed; four rows of a&s;paragus are to be planted in each bed, and ten or twelve inches di&s;tance to be allowed between plant and plant in the row, and let the out&s;ide rows of
<PB N="113" REF="026198_0221_0FCF5818E9557B60">
each bed be nine inches from the edge; the latter end of March or in April, as the &s;ea&s;on is, is the time for planting.</P>
<P>The following is the method: &s;train your lines lengthways the beds, nine inches from the edge, and then with a &s;pade cut out a &s;mall trench clo&s;e to the line, about &s;ix inch|es deep, making that &s;ide next the line near|ly upright; and when one trench is opened, plant that before you open another, placing the plants the di&s;tance of ten or twelve inch|es in the row.</P>
<P>In planting the&s;e plants, ob&s;erve they mu&s;t not be placed flat in the bottom of the trench, but nearly upright again&s;t the back of the trench or drill, that the crown of the plants may &s;tand upright, and two or three inches below the &s;urface of the ground, and let them be placed all at an equal depth, &s;preading their roots &s;omewhat regular, again&s;t the back of the trench, and at the &s;ame time drawing a little earth up again&s;t them with the hand as you place them, ju&s;t to fix the plants in their due po&s;ition, till the row is planted, then when one row is thus planted, immediately with a rake, draw the earth into the drill over the plants, and then proceed to open another drill or trench as before directed,
<PB N="214" REF="026198_0222_0FD0322445A3E0D0">
plant it in the &s;ame manner, and cover in the plants as before, and &s;o on till the whole is planted. When they are all planted, let the &s;urface of the beds be raked &s;mooth, and clear them from &s;tones. At each cor|ner of the bed, let a firm &s;take be driven in the ground, to &s;erve as a mark for the al|leys.</P>
<P>The a&s;paragus being planted, the next care is, when the plants come up, which will be in a month, to keep them clean from weeds, which mu&s;t be well attended to during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Let it next be ob&s;erved, that it will be three years from the time of planting, before the a&s;paragus plants produce buds large enough for u&s;e; though &s;ometimes a few of the lar|ge&s;t buds may be cut the &s;econd &s;pring after planting; but I &s;hould advi&s;e to let it be the third year, before you make a general cut|ting.</P>
<P>A plantation of a&s;paragus, if the beds are properly dre&s;&s;ed every year, as I &s;hall hereaf|ter direct, will continue to produce good buds for ten or twelve years.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="026198_0223_0FCF582105D5D5E0">The &s;eeds for the&s;e plants may be &s;own in the &s;pring of the year in rich mould at five or &s;ix inches apart, and it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv|ed they are not to exceed two years old before they are planted as before directed.</P>
<P>The manner of dre&s;&s;ing the a&s;paragus beds is as follows: in October, cut down the &s;talks clo&s;e to the &s;urface of the beds; carry them immediately off the ground; then with a &s;harp hoe cut up all the weeds, and draw them off the beds into the alleys. This done, &s;tretch the line, and with a &s;pade mark out the alleys from about eighteen inches to two feet wide, according to the width they were fir&s;t made. Then dig the alleys one &s;pade deep, and &s;pread the earth evenly over the beds; and as you advance in digging, let the weeds which were raked off the beds into the alleys, be digged into the bottom, and cover them a proper depth with earth; but when the beds are old they will need an augment of old rotten dung once in two or three years; this is the time to do it, but the manure or dung mu&s;t be applied before the alleys are digged, or the beds landed up.</P>
<P>Every &s;pring the a&s;paragus beds mu&s;t be dre&s;&s;ed and forked, which is done by &s;lightly digging them with a three pronged fork; this
<PB N="216" REF="026198_0224_0FD0322821DD1140">
work &s;hould be done very early in the &s;pring, before the buds &s;hoot out. The beds be|ing forked, they mu&s;t be immediately raked even.</P>
<P>For artichokes, the land mu&s;t be good and well dre&s;&s;ed with dung. The &s;lips or &s;uckers &s;lipped off from the old plants are the proper|e&s;t &s;ets to plant. There are two &s;orts, the large globe artichoke, and the French or green oval; but the former is greatly preferable, the heads being con&s;iderably larger, and the eat|able parts more thick and fle&s;hy. They &s;hould be planted in an open &s;ituation; plant the &s;ets with a dibble in rows a yard a&s;under, and not le&s;s than two feet, nor more than a yard di&s;tant from one another in the row. Give them &s;ome water immediately after they are planted, to &s;ettle the earth about the plants.</P>
<P>The above plantation, if kept clear from weeds, and now and then watered in dry weather and in the beginning of the &s;ummer, will not fail to produce good artichokes the following autumn.</P>
<P>A plantation of artichokes will continue to produce good heads &s;ix years, and &s;ometimes longer; but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that if requi|red
<PB N="217" REF="026198_0225_0FD0322D001BCD30">
to have a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e fruits for four or five months in the &s;ummer, &s;hould make a new plantation every &s;pring; for the old &s;tocks which have been planted a year or two or more, produce heads in June and July; and tho&s;e planted now, pro|duce heads in Augu&s;t, September, and Oc|tober.</P>

<P>Be careful to procure &s;ome good &s;ets, that is, to pick a quantity of the be&s;t kind of po|tatoes perfectly &s;ound, and of a tolerable large &s;ize: the&s;e are to be prepared for plant|ing by cutting each root into two, three, or more pieces, minding&punc; particularly that each piece be furni&s;hed with at lea&s;t one or two eyes, which is &s;ufficient.

The rea&s;on for cut|ting the grafts &s;o &s;oon, is, becau&s;e the buds will now begin to &s;well fa&s;t; and if the grafts were not to be cut off in proper time, the buds would be too far advanced, and the grafts would by that means, not take kindly with the &s;tock, or, at lea&s;t, not &s;hoot &s;o free|ly.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to the methods of graft|ing, it will fir&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary to mention what &s;tocks are proper to graft the different kinds of fruit upon; for in&s;tance, apples &s;hould be grafted upon &s;tocks rai&s;ed from the kernels of the &s;ame kinds of fruit, i. e. any kinds of ap|ples; for the grafts or buds of the&s;e trees will not take well upon any other &s;tocks.</P>
<P>The time for &s;owing the kernels of any &s;orts of apples or wild crabs, is either in No|vember or March; but if not &s;own till March, they mu&s;t be kept in &s;and till that time. The&s;e are to be &s;own in beds three feet and a half wide, ob&s;erving to &s;ow them mode|rately
<PB N="221" REF="026198_0229_0FD0323A4E8FA558">
thick, and cover them about an inch at lea&s;t with earth. The plants will come up in five or &s;ix weeks, if &s;own in the &s;pring; and in the autumn or &s;pring following, &s;ome of the large&s;t plants &s;hould be drawn out and planted in nur&s;ery beds; and in the &s;econd or third year after, they will be in order to ground graft on; but tho&s;e that are for head grafting you may let &s;tand four or five years.</P>
<P>Pears are generally grafted or budded upon &s;tocks rai&s;ed al&s;o from kernels of any of their own kinds of fruits; likewi&s;e upon quince &s;tocks, which do very well. Sometimes they are grafted upon white thorn &s;tocks; but this is not commonly practi&s;ed, as the&s;e &s;tocks have an ill effect on &s;everal &s;orts of their fruit: the &s;ea&s;on for &s;owing the kernels of the pears and quinces to rai&s;e &s;tocks, the tran&s;planting, and time of grafting, is the &s;ame as mention|ed before for apples.</P>
<P>Cherries are propagated by grafting or budding them upon &s;tocks, rai&s;ed from the &s;tones of the common black or red cherry, or upon &s;tocks rai&s;ed from the &s;tones of any other kind of the&s;e fruit; but the two fir&s;t are mo&s;t e&s;teemed for that purpo&s;e, becau&s;e they generally &s;hoot much freer than any
<PB N="222" REF="026198_0230_0FCF582379AAAE18">
other. The &s;ea&s;on for &s;owing the cherry-&s;tones, and the management in every re&s;pect, is the &s;ame as before mentioned for apples and pears.</P>
<P>Plumbs are al&s;o grafted or budded upon plumb &s;tocks; that is, &s;tocks rai&s;ed by &s;owing the &s;tones of any of the common &s;orts of the &s;ame fruit; al&s;o rai&s;ed occa&s;ionally by &s;uck|ers, &s;ent up from the roots of any kinds of plumb-trees. The time for &s;owing the &s;tones to rai&s;e the &s;tocks, and the management in every re&s;pect, is the &s;ame as the fruits before mentioned.</P>
<P>Thus ob&s;erve as before, let the &s;tocks for grafting, both of fruit trees and others, be always of the &s;ame family or genus as that of the re&s;pective trees which are to be graft|ed.</P>
<P>Note, &s;tocks rai&s;ed from &s;eed, being mo&s;tly of a &s;tronger growth, are commonly called free &s;tocks.</P>

<HEAD>General <HI>OBSERVATIONS</HI> for performing the <HI>WORK.</HI></HEAD>
<P>There are &s;everal methods of grafting, but I &s;hall only take notice of four, which are practi&s;ed with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, &s;uch as whip-grafting, cleft-grafting, crown-grafting, and grafting by approach or in-arching.</P>
<P>Previous to grafting, you mu&s;t be provid|ed with a proper grafting knife; a quantity of &s;trong ba&s;s-&s;trings for bandages, to tie the &s;tocks and grafts firmly together; and &s;ome well wrought clay, to clay them round over the tying, to &s;ecure them from the air and wet.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve that the &s;tocks intended to be graf|ted, mu&s;t previous to the in&s;ertion of the graft, be headed down; which, if intended for ground grafting, mu&s;t be headed pretty low within five or &s;ix inches of the ground; but if for head grafting, they may be headed at four, five or &s;ix feet. If ground grafted, you mu&s;t train up one &s;trong &s;hoot from the graft for a &s;tem, till it is five or &s;ix feet high, then
<PB N="224" REF="026198_0232_0FD032459EAEA510">
topped or cut off at that height, to cau&s;e it to throw out branches to form the head.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST. WHIP-GRAFTING.</HEAD>
<P>This kind of grafting is practi&s;ed with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s upon &s;mall &s;tocks, from about a quarter or one third of an inch to half an inch, or near an inch in diameter: but com|monly prefer &s;mall &s;tocks of about half an inch or near equal in &s;ize with the graft; and the method of performing this work is this, have your cions or grafts, &amp;c. ready; then be|gin by cutting off the head of the &s;tock at a convenient height, according to the above rules; this done, fix upon a &s;mooth part of the &s;tock, where headed off, and there pare off the rind with a little of the wood, in a &s;omewhat &s;loping manner upwards, about an inch, or near an inch and half in length; then, having the cions cut into lengths of four or five eyes each, prepare one to fit the &s;tock as above, by cutting it al&s;o a little &s;lo|ping, &s;o as to exactly fit the cut part of the &s;tock, as if cut from the &s;ame place, that the rinds of both may join in every part; then cut a &s;lit or tongue about half an inch in length upwards in the cion, and cut a &s;lit
<PB N="225" REF="026198_0233_0FD0324A4B1641C0">
the &s;ame length downwards, in the &s;tock to receive the &s;aid tongue; in that manner fix the graft in the &s;tock, taking care that the &s;ap or rind of both may meet, or join as ex|act as po&s;&s;ible in every part.</P>
<P>Having thus fixed the graft, let it be im|mediately tied with a &s;tring of &s;oft ba&s;s, bringing it in a neat manner &s;everal times round the graft and &s;tocks, taking care to pre&s;erve the graft in its due po&s;ition; and let the bandage be neatly tied, and immediately cover the place with &s;ome grafting clay, ob|&s;erving to bring the clay near an inch above the top of the &s;tock, and a little lower than the bottom part of the graft, leaving a due thickne&s;s on every &s;ide of the graft, and &s;tock, making it a roundi&s;h oval form, and take care to clo&s;e it well in every part, that no wet, wind, or &s;un can enter, to prevent which, is the whole intention of the clay; for without that precaution, the operation would prove fruitle&s;s; and in this manner proceed with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In performing the operation of whip-graf|ting, &s;ome grafters fir&s;t cut and prepare the cion, and then cut and fit the &s;tocks to that; but it is not material which, provided it be
<PB N="226" REF="026198_0234_0FD0324F1F35E9F8">
done in an exact and &s;omewhat expeditious manner.</P>
<P>Next it mu&s;t be noted, that the grafts mu&s;t be now and then examined, to &s;ee if the clay any where falls off, or cracks; if it does, it mu&s;t be renewed with fre&s;h clay. By the la&s;t week in May, or fir&s;t week in June, the grafts and &s;tocks will be well united, and then take off the clay, and loo&s;en the bandages.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SECOND. CLEFT-GRAFTING.</HEAD>
<P>The next general method of grafting is, that by clefting the &s;tock, commonly called cleft or &s;lit-grafting, becau&s;e the &s;tock is cleft, and the graft put into the cleft part; and is performed in the following manner:</P>
<P>The proper &s;ized &s;tocks on which this kind of grafting is performed, are gene|rally about an inch, or an inch and an half, and even two inches, or more, in dia|meter. Fir&s;t, with a &s;trong knife, or &s;mall &s;aw, cut off the head of your &s;tock, and pare it very &s;mooth; this done, fix upon a &s;mooth part of the &s;tock, ju&s;t below where headed, to place your graft, and on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide to
<PB N="227" REF="026198_0235_0FD03253B7DF8EF0">
that, cut away part of the &s;tock, about an inch and an half, in a &s;loping manner upwards, &s;o as the crown of the &s;tock may not be more than about half an inch broad. This done, prepare your graft or cion, which is done in this manner: ob&s;erve to cut your grafts into due lengths, leaving four or five eyes to each; then take your &s;harpe&s;t knife, and pare away the bark and &s;ome of the wood, at the lower end of the graft, in a &s;looping man|ner, about an inch and an half, or near two inches in length; and then cut the other &s;ide in the &s;ame form, making it to have a wedge-like &s;hape; but let one &s;ide of it, which is to be placed outwards in the &s;tocks, be left near double the thickne&s;s of the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>The graft being prepared, take your &s;trong knife, and place it on the middle of the &s;tock, cro&s;s-ways the top of the &s;loped part, and with your mallet &s;trike your knife to the &s;tock, ob&s;erving to cleave it no farther than what is nece&s;&s;ary to admit the graft readily; then place the grafting chi&s;&s;el, or &s;ome in&s;tru|ment a little way into the cleft at the &s;loped part of the &s;tock, to keep it open for the re|ception of the graft, which then directly in|troduce into the cleft on the uncut or upright &s;ide of the &s;tock at the back of the &s;lope, in|&s;erting
<PB N="228" REF="026198_0236_0FD0325633135910">
it with great exactne&s;s, as far as it is cut, with the thicke&s;t edge outwards, and &s;o that the rind may meet exactly every way with the rind of the &s;tock.</P>
<P>The graft being placed, then remove the grafting chi&s;&s;el, taking care not to di&s;place the graft; this done, let it be tied and well clayed in the manner as before directed, in the work of whip or tongue-grafting; or, if in this cleft-grafting, you choo&s;e to put in two grafts, it may be performed on large &s;tocks, and which mu&s;t be twice cleft, and the clefts mu&s;t not be acro&s;s, but parallel to each other, and &s;o fix the grafts in the &s;tock, ob&s;erving to bind, and clay them as before. This kind of grafting may likewi&s;e be per|formed on the branches of trees that already bear fruit, if you de&s;ire to change the &s;orts.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THIRD. CROWN-GRAFTING.</HEAD>
<P>This way of grafting is commonly practi&s;ed upon &s;uch &s;tocks as are too large and &s;tub|born to cleave, and is often perfomed upon the branches of apple and large pear trees, &amp;c. that already bear fruit, when it is in|tended to change the &s;orts, or to renew the tree with fre&s;h bearing wood.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="026198_0237_0FCF5827C3757F80">The manner of doing this &s;ort of grafting is as follows: fir&s;t to cut off the head of the tree or &s;tock level, or of any parti|cular branch of a tree which you intend to graft, and pare the top perfectly &s;mooth, then prepare your grafts, which is done by cutting one &s;ide flat and a little &s;loping about two inches in length, making a kind of &s;houlder at the top of the cut, to re&s;t on the head of the &s;tock; and pare off only a little of the bark towards each edge of the other &s;ide of the graft; then rai&s;e the bark of the &s;tock, fir&s;t by &s;litting it downwards, and then having a &s;mall wedge of hard wood, or rather iron, one &s;ide of it formed &s;omewhat round|i&s;h, the other flat; let this in&s;trument be dri|ven down gently between the bark and wood of the &s;tock or branch, the flat &s;ide towards the wood, driving it far enough to make room for the graft; then drawing out the wedge, &s;lip down the graft, placing the cut or &s;loped &s;ide towards the wood, thru&s;ting it down as far as cut, re&s;ting the &s;houlder thereof upon the top of the &s;tock; and in this manner you may put four, five, or &s;ix grafts, or as many as may &s;eem convenient, upon each &s;tock or branch, and bind them round with &s;trong ba&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="026198_0238_0FD03257826F4E68">When the grafts are all thus fixed, you mu&s;t then immediately apply a good quanti|ty of well wrought clay; bringing it clo&s;e about the &s;talk and grafts, ob&s;erving to rai&s;e it at lea&s;t an inch above the top of the &s;tock, in a rounding manner, &s;o as to throw the wet quickly off, and prevent its lodging or getting into the work, which would ruin all.</P>
<P>The&s;e trees which are grafted this way, will take and &s;hoot very free; but there is, for the fir&s;t year or two after grafting, an incon|venience attending them, and that is the grafts being liable to be blown out of the &s;tock by violent winds; but this may be remedied by tying two or three &s;ticks to the body of the &s;tock, or branch, that is grafted, and the grafts tied to the &s;ticks.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>FOURTH. GRAFTING</HI> by <HI>APPROACH,</HI> Or, <HI>IN-ARCHING.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Another way of grafting occa&s;ionally prac|ti&s;ed, is generally called in-arching, or grafting by approach; but is not near &s;o commonly, practi&s;ed as the three ways beforementioned, and was chiefly invented for &s;uch trees, as
<PB N="231" REF="026198_0239_0FD03259BB02FAB8">
are not ea&s;ily propagated by any other me|thod.</P>
<P>The method of performing the operation is this: when it is intended to propagate any kind of trees or &s;hrubs by this manner of grafting, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the &s;tock you would graft upon, and the tree from which you would take the graft, mu&s;t &s;tand &s;o near, or can be placed &s;o near, that the bo|dy of the branch you would in-arch, can, as it grows, be brought to approach and join readily to a convenient part of the body of the &s;tock; for the graft is not to be &s;eparated from the mother plant, till &s;ome months af|ter performing the operation; nor is the head of the &s;tock to be cut off till that time, except you cannot otherwi&s;e conveniently fix the graft.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, either having the &s;tocks and the trees de&s;igned to in-arch from, growing on the &s;ame ground near together, or in pots, or that you want to in-arch &s;ome branches of trees, &amp;c. and that the &s;aid branches are three, four, or five feet or more from the &s;urface of the ground, and &s;uppo&s;e the &s;talks you would graft upon to be in pots; in that ca&s;e there mu&s;t be a kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">light &s;tage erected, clo&s;e to, and as high as the branches of the tree:
<PB N="232" REF="026198_0240_0FD0325C60FD3C78">
upon this &s;tage the pots which contain the &s;talks mu&s;t be placed.</P>
<P>Thus far ob&s;erved, then, in either ca&s;e, proceed to the work, take one of the branches you de&s;ire to in-arch, and bring the body of the &s;aid branch to touch that of the &s;tock at &s;uch a convenient height, where the &s;tock and graft is nearly of a &s;ize, and mark the parts where the graft and &s;tock will mo&s;t rea|dily join together; then in that part of the branch pare away the bark and part of the wood, about three inches in length, and in the &s;ame manner let the rind and wood be pared off that &s;ide of the &s;tock where the branch is to be joined, the &s;ame length and breadth, &s;o that both the cut parts may exact|ly join rind to rind; then cut a &s;lit or thin tongue upwards in the branch, and make a &s;lit of the &s;ame length to receive it down|wards in the &s;tock; then let them be joined, placing the branch with the top upright, &s;lip|ping the tongue of the graft into the &s;lit made in the &s;tock: and &s;ee that the cut parts join in an exact manner, and let them be imme|diately tied together with &s;ome ba&s;s, and af|terwards cover over the place with a due quantity of well wrought clay, very well clo|&s;ed, that no air nor wet can penetrate.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="026198_0241_0FCF582C460FC9D0">After this, let a &s;tout &s;take be driven into the ground, and that part of the &s;tock and graft mu&s;t be fa&s;tened to it, which prevents the graft from being di&s;placed by the wind. Remember that the &s;tock and graft are to re|main in that po&s;ition for at lea&s;t fifteen or &s;ixteen weeks, when they will be well united. The graft is then to be &s;eparated from the mother plant; being careful to do this with a perfect &s;harp knife, cutting off the branch with a &s;lope downwards to the &s;tock; and if not done in grafting, the head of the &s;tock to be cut clo&s;e to the graft. The old clay and ban|dage are at this time to be taken off: and at the &s;ame time it will be advi&s;eable to tie them again gently, and al&s;o to put &s;ome fre&s;h clay which will be of great &s;ervice, and let them re|main &s;o for a month or five weeks.</P>
<P>By this kind of grafting, you may rai&s;e al|mo&s;t any kind of tree or &s;hrub; as is often practi&s;ed by way of curio&s;ity, to ingraft a fruit bearing branch of a fruit-tree upon one of the common &s;tocks of the re&s;pective &s;orts; by which means, there is rai&s;ed a new tree, bear|ing fruit in a few months: this is &s;ometimes practi&s;ed upon orange-trees, &amp;c. by grafting fruit branches on &s;tocks rai&s;ed to a proper &s;ize, from the kernels of the fruit.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="026198_0242_0FD03261714090F8">Note, in this method of grafting, the &s;tocks may occa&s;ionally be both in the full ground or in pots, the latter is nece&s;&s;ary where the branches of the trees you would in-arch are not near enough the ground, or for orange and other green-hou&s;e trees and &s;hrubs; but as for &s;uch trees and &s;hrubs as grow in the common ground, and who&s;e branches are fa|vorably &s;ituated for that work, there may be &s;tocks placed either in pots, or planted in the ground near the &s;aid trees, &amp;c. or it may be performed on &s;tocks or trees that grow acci|dentally near.</P>

<HEAD>BUDDING OR INOCULATING.</HEAD>
<P>The proper time for budding or inocula|ting, is from the latter end of June to the beginning of Augu&s;t; fir&s;t begin on &s;tone fruit, the early kinds, &s;uch as apricots, peaches, and nectarines; cloudy weather be&s;t &s;uits this work; but if no &s;uch weather happens, it will then be mo&s;t proper to do it principally in a morning or evening.</P>
<P>The proper &s;tocks on which to bud the above kinds of fruit-trees, are principally tho&s;e of the plumb, rai&s;ed from the &s;tones of the fruit; and when two or three years old,
<PB N="235" REF="026198_0243_0FD0326361598960">
are of a proper &s;ize to bud upon; or the&s;e &s;tocks may be al&s;o rai&s;ed from the &s;uckers of plumb-trees.</P>
<P>It will be of particular &s;ervice in this coun|try to bud the peach on plumb-&s;tocks, as it will make the peach trees la&s;ting; for the worm that de&s;troys the peach-tree rai&s;ed from the &s;tone of that fruit in a few years, will not hurt that rai&s;ed on the plumb-&s;tock. &mdash;The buds mu&s;t be in&s;erted one in a &s;tock at about &s;ix inches from the ground, if the tree is intended to be a dwarf; but for a large &s;tandard, the budding may be perform|ed at the height of three, four, five or &s;ix feet.</P>
<P>Cherries are to be budded principally up|on cherry &s;tocks, which mu&s;t be al&s;o rai&s;ed by &s;owing the &s;tones; and all &s;orts of plumbs &s;hould be budded on plumb &s;tocks; pears may be budded on pear &s;tocks; and the&s;e mu&s;t be rai&s;ed by &s;owing the kernels. Oran|ges and lemons mu&s;t be budded on &s;tocks rai&s;|ed from the kernels of the &s;ame fruit. Ro&s;es, je&s;&s;amines, myrtles, and any other curious &s;hrubs, may be inoculated; the curious &s;orts budded on the common ones of the &s;ame &s;pecies;</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="026198_0244_0FD0326912D5AF90">Budding may al&s;o be performed upon trees that bear fruit. What is meant by this, is where there are trees, that produce fruit not of the approved kinds; &s;uch trees may be budded with the &s;orts de&s;ired; and the bud|ding is to be performed upon &s;trong &s;hoots of the &s;ame &s;ummer's growth. Several buds may be put into every &s;uch tree, by which means the tree will be &s;oon covered with the de&s;ired kinds, and in two or three years af|ter budding they will begin to bear.</P>
<P>The manner of performing the work of budding or inoculating is this: in the fir&s;t place, be provided with a &s;harp pen-knife, with a flat ivory haft. The haft &s;hould be &s;omewhat taper, and quite thin at the end; which knife and haft is to be u&s;ed as hereaf|ter directed; and al&s;o provide &s;ome new ba&s;s mat, for bandages; and let this, before you u&s;e it, be &s;oaked in water. In the next place, you are to provide a parcel of cuttings of the re&s;pective trees from which you intend to take the buds: the&s;e cuttings mu&s;t be &s;hoots of the &s;ame &s;ummer's growth, and mu&s;t be cut from trees as are in health, bear well, and &s;hoot freely, minding to choo&s;e &s;uch &s;hoots as have &s;trength, and are free in their growth, but not luxuriant.</P>

Then get one of your cuttings, or &s;hoots, and take off the bud in this manner: you are to begin toward the lower, or bigge&s;t end of the &s;hoot; and in the fir&s;t place, cut off all the leaves, but ob&s;erving to leave part of the foot &s;talk of each remaining; then, about an inch be|low the lower bud or eye, make a cro&s;s cut in the &s;hoot, almo&s;t half way through, with the knive &s;lanting upwards, and with a clean cut, bring it out about half an inch above the eye or bud, detaching the bud with part of the bark and wood thereto: then immedi|ately let that part of the wood which was taken off with the bud, be &s;eparated from the bark, in which is contained the bud; and this is readily done with your knife, placing the point of it between the bark and wood at one end, and &s;o pull off the woody part, which will readily part from the bark; then quickly examine the in&s;ide, to &s;ee if the eye of the bud be left; for if there appears a &s;mall

<P>Having thus fixed the bud, let the &s;talk in that part be immediately bound round with a &s;tring of new ba&s;s mat, beginning a little be|low the cut, and proceeding upwards, draw|ing it clo&s;ely round to the top of the &s;lit; but be &s;ure to mi&s;s the eye of the bud, bringing the tying clo&s;e to it below and above, only ju&s;t leaving the eye of the bud open; and this fini&s;hes the work for the pre&s;ent.</P>

therefore let the bandages of tho&s;e that have taken, be loo&s;ened; and this is done in order to give free cour&s;e to the &s;ap, that the bud ac|cording as it &s;wells, may not be pinched; for were the bandages &s;uffered to remain as fir&s;t tied, they would pinch the buds and &s;poil them. To prevent this, it would be mo&s;t ad|vi&s;eable to loo&s;en them all in about three weeks, or, at farthe&s;t, a month after budding, which concludes the work till the March fol|lowing, as, until which time, the bud remains dormant, then &s;hoots forth with vigor.</P>
<P>At the time, i. e. the beginning of March, you are to cut off the heads of the &s;tocks; ob&s;erving to cut them off about a hand's breadth above the in&s;ertion of the bud; and this part of the &s;tock left above the bud is to remain till the next &s;pring, and will &s;erve to tie the &s;hoot to, which the bud makes the fir&s;t &s;ummer: for the buds never begin to &s;hoot till the &s;pring after budding.

<P>The fruit trees which were grafted and budded a year ago, &s;hould have their &s;hoots, which were produced the la&s;t &s;ummer, &s;hort|ened, that they may &s;end forth lateral &s;hoots,

<P>Having dwelt very fully on the proper me|thods of propagating all the &s;orts of fruit trees as is nece&s;&s;ary for the farmer, which by pro|per attention, every one, even of the meane&s;t capacity, may plant nur&s;eries of young trees of their own, and bring them to that perfec|tion fit for planting out in the field, which will &s;ave them that money; for the nur&s;ery will be of no expence, and attended with very little trouble.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome very ignorant men, who rai&s;e tho&s;e trees which they &s;ell to the farmer. The&s;e men make you believe there is &s;ome great art in propagating the&s;e &s;pecies, when at the &s;ame time nothing can be more plain and ea&s;y. The plants for the &s;tocks to graft on, may be picked up in your orchards, fields, or gardens, which if taken up at the proper &s;ea&s;on (&s;pring and fall) and planted at fifteen or eighteen inches apart in the rows, and five

feet between the rows, which will admit of its being plowed between to keep them clear from weeds. By this method there may be collected in a &s;hort time, a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;tocks, fit for grafting or budding. Ob|&s;erve when tho&s;e young plants are planted, let them be well watered.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew the great advan|tages accruing to the farmer by planting fruit trees in the field: it furni&s;hes him with a good beverage for common u&s;e; and likewi&s;e if he choo&s;es to di&s;til his cider, it will make a good whole&s;ome &s;pirit; and what the far|mer has to &s;pare, will always fetch him ready money.</P>

<P>The proper time for planting them out, is, from the beginning of October, till the begin|ning of May, in mild open weather; they &s;hould not be planted too near or clo&s;e toge|ther, two pole or perch is the neare&s;t di&s;tance, but if they were planted three perch apart eve|ry way it would be much better, as they would

not be &s;o apt to blight, neither would they hurt the grain or gra&s;s that grow underneath.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t give directions for planting tho&s;e fields that are under the plow; and &s;e|condly, tho&s;e fields that are under gra&s;s, or has a &s;ward.</P>
<P>The method of planting fruit trees in the plowed fields is to open a wide hole for every tree about a &s;pade deep, at the proper di&s;tan|ces you intend planting of them, and loo&s;en the bottom well; then prune the roots of the trees; that is, cut off brui&s;ed or broken roots, and trim the ends a little of all, the very long &s;traggling roots in general; and prune out ir|regular &s;hoots of the head: then place the tree in the hole, put &s;ome good mould to the roots and cover them about four inches, then get &s;ome long dung that is moi&s;t, or wet &s;traw and fill up the hole with it, then throw &s;ome good mould over the dung or &s;traw, which rai&s;e in form of a hill, and make a trench round the tree at the di&s;tance of about eigh|teen inches from the &s;tem of the tree, to re|ceive, and retain the wet; which will &s;ave the trouble of watering in dry weather.</P>
<P>To &s;upport the new planted fruit-trees from the violence of the winds, let &s;takes be drove down in tho&s;e trenches, and fa&s;tened
<PB N="243" REF="026198_0251_0FD0327F1C376B50">
atop to the &s;tem of the tree, with &s;traw bands, as they are &s;oft and will hinder the tree from chafing.</P>
<P>The method of planting fruit trees in tho&s;e fields under gra&s;s, or turf, &s;hould be done in the following manner; pare as thin a turf off as po&s;&s;ible, then take up all the mould even to the clay, gravel, or &s;and; this done, put the turf at the bottom of the hole, the gra&s;s down|wards, &s;pread a little good mould on the &s;ame, on which plant the tree as before directed: Then with a &s;pade fir&s;t give a circular cut a|bout the ba&s;on-heap of mould; then &s;ix or eight inches back from that, give another cir|cular cut, and turn up all the turf, letting it lie with the gra&s;s part downwards, &s;lopeways, and joining the &s;aid ba&s;on-heap; by this, there will be a round gutter, which at all times is ready to receive and make a lodge|ment of all rains that &s;hall fall, and will &s;uf|ficiently &s;upply the fibrous roots with moi|&s;ture as they gradually proceed from the ma|&s;ter-roots.</P>
<P>The dung or &s;traw being placed between the two moulds, becomes a watering pot to the root, and by the help of the uper mould,

laid in a ba&s;on form, &s;helters and &s;hades the &s;ame, both from the &s;un and air's too violent influences.</P>
<P>There is another method which I have tried with &s;ucce&s;s; I had a field that was 40 poles or perches &s;quare, all round this field next to the fence I planted with apple trees, at the di&s;tance of two perch a&s;under, and twenty feet from the fence, &s;o that I had eighty trees in one row, in the form of a &s;quare. The middle of the field was plowed in general, and &s;owed with grain, the border all round for forty feet was laid down with gra&s;s, &s;o that the trees &s;tood in the middle of the gra&s;s plat. The&s;e trees bore abundantly; the cau&s;e of which I imagine was by their having a free circulation of the air; and I had great crops of grain in the middle of the field, from its not being &s;had|ed too much, and by the trees fending off the cold winds.</P>

<P>I would wi&s;h to introduce the drinking of beer in this country, for the common drink; knowing by experience that it is the mo&s;t whole&s;ome beveradge made u&s;e of; therefore recommend it to private families, to brew their own beer.</P>
<P>The high price beer is &s;old at by the brew|ers, may deter &s;ome from undertaking it: thinking it may be very expen&s;ive; but I &s;hall here lay down the expence, which will &s;atisfy them to the contrary.</P>
<P>If the farmers were to let their men have good beer, or ale, at hay and harve&s;t time,
<PB REF="026198_0255_0FD03285E3352B18">
to drink in&s;tead of cider and &s;pirits, they would be able to go through double the la|bour, with half the fatigue to them&s;elves. In order to prepare for the breewing of beer, the uten&s;ils mu&s;t fir&s;t be procured, and fixed. For tho&s;e that can afford it, and would wi&s;h to have a handy and complete brewhou&s;e, I will give them a &s;ketch of one, with the pro|per uten&s;ils on a plan fit for family u&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the brew-hou&s;e &s;hould be erected on the northern &s;ide of your buildings, for &s;hade and coolne&s;s; the ground plan &s;hould be twenty feet, by fifteen feet; three &s;ides out of the four &s;hould be open, e&s;pecially of the upper part, to let in the free circulation of air: the&s;e o|pen &s;ides &s;hould have brackets &s;lanting down|wards, to fix or nail battons on about three or four inches wide, to keep out the wet. The copper, which at lea&s;t &s;hould hold forty gallons, &s;hould be fixed at the clo&s;e end, with a chimney to go through the roof. This copper &s;hould have a bra&s;s cock, and the cop|per &s;hould be &s;et pretty high. The ma&s;h ton &s;hould hold double the quantity of the copper, in order to hold the malt, as well as the water; this ton &s;hould be circular, and large&s;t at the bottom, and &s;hould be &s;o placed that the water from the copper may run through a &s;hute into the top of the ma&s;h ton.
<PB N="248" REF="026198_0256_0FD0328C07914D38">
And underneath this ma&s;h ton, there mu&s;t be placed an underback, made in the &s;ame form of the ma&s;h ton, but need not hold more than the copper, then there mu&s;t be two coolers made &s;quare and &s;hallow, not above &s;ix inches deep, and placed one above the other; the top of the highe&s;t mu&s;t not be higher than the top of the copper, and each of them mu&s;t hold as much as the copper, and underneath, or near the coolers, mu&s;t be fix|ed a working ton, of the &s;ame form of the ma&s;h ton, and the &s;ame &s;ize; there &s;hould be a fal&s;e bottom to the ma&s;h ton, and a cock fixt below the fal&s;e bottom, to let the wort out into the underback; and in this under|back &s;hould be fixed a pump, to pump up the wort, back into the copper; then there is wanting a ma&s;hing oar, pails, bowl, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The proce&s;s of brewing is as follows: a quantity of water being boiled in your cop|per, is emptied into the ma&s;h tub; and as &s;oon as the vapour is &s;pent, the malt is pour|ed upon it; but it mu&s;t not be &s;tirred till the malt has &s;ettled gradually, and the liquor, on

<P>Ob&s;erve, that as &s;oon as the &s;econd cop|per of boiling water is emptied into the ma&s;h tub, then the fir&s;t wort mixed with hops mu&s;t be returned into the copper and boiled an hour for &s;trong beer, if to be drank new; an hour, and an half if to be kept &s;ome time; al|ways taking care to make the wort boil rea|&s;onably fa&s;t; for if it &s;immers long, it will wa&s;te more and ferment wor&s;e.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t wort or &s;trong beer when boiled enough is put into the upper cooler, and from that let into the lower one. If it is in the &s;ummer, it mu&s;t be drawn off very cool into the working ton, but if it is in the winter,
<PB N="250" REF="026198_0258_0FD032908345F788">
it mu&s;t be blood warm when you &s;et it to work. The &s;econd wort is for table beer and common drink, which is let into the under|back, from that to the copper, &amp;c. the &s;ame as the &s;trong beer; the &s;ame hops, with only a few fre&s;h ones will do for it.</P>
<P>When the wort is cool enough for the fat, a little yea&s;t is mixed with a &s;ufficient quan|tity of warm wort to make it ferment in the hand bowl, and this fermentation is put in|to the working tub, and when it has rai&s;ed a thick yea&s;t or &s;cum upon the wort in the fat, it &s;hould be mixed again with the hand-bo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">l.

After which the ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t be &s;topped clo&s;e, and not opened till fit to drink.</P>
<P>Soft water is the be&s;t for brewing: rain wa|ter exceeds all others; therefore, if it could be &s;o contrived to have a back, what the brew|ers call a liquor back, on the top of the brew-hou&s;e, and the rain water conveyed to it by gutters from all parts of your hou&s;e, you might &s;ave a &s;ufficient &s;tock; which might be let into the copper by a pipe with a cock at the end, which would &s;ave a great deal of la|bour.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="026198_0259_0FD032934D0538B0">The beer may be brewed to what &s;trength you plea&s;e.

<P>The quantity of hops to be u&s;ed is accord|ing to their quality, and the time you would wi&s;h to keep it.

<P>There are many who cannot afford to build a brew-hou&s;e, or to buy the uten&s;ils as be|forementioned; therefore I will endeavour to put them in a method to do it at a &s;mall expence.

<HEAD>To make <HI>CIDER</HI> keep, and be much &s;tronger than common.</HEAD>
<P>It is of great importance in making cider to have the fruit thoroughly ripe. The jui|ces of unripe fruit, retain their har&s;h, &s;our &s;tate in &s;pite of all endeavours, and never acquire that racy, mellow flavour, which the &s;un only can be&s;tow. It &s;hould therefore be the fir&s;t care of every one concerned in ma|king cider, to let his apples hang on the trees, till they arrive at their full maturity.</P>
<P>When your apples are fit for gathering (which &s;hould always be done by hand) it is e&s;&s;ential to choo&s;e dry weather for that pur|po&s;e; for water is a bad ingredient in all vi|nous liquors: one general rule for all fruits is to pre&s;s their juice for fermenting, when
<PB N="253" REF="026198_0261_0FD03299A38CE808">
the fruit is in the greate&s;t perfection for eat|ing.</P>
<P>Apples that have lain any time in heaps to &s;weat, are generally covered with a clam|my moi&s;ture; this &s;hould be wiped off, for it is a watry juice, which would impoveri&s;h the cider; the rotten parts of the apples &s;hould all be cut out, for they communicate to the cider a putrid ta&s;te.</P>
<P>In breaking of the apples, that engine is be&s;t, which lea&s;t brui&s;es the &s;kin, pulp, and kernels of the apple; becau&s;e from an immo|derate breaking of them in &s;ome kinds of ap|ples, there proceeds &s;uch an au&s;terity and bit|terne&s;s, as the cider never can be cured of. In pre&s;&s;ing of them, they &s;hould not be pre&s;|&s;ed too near, and the pulp &s;hould be wrap|ped up in clean hair cloths, in&s;tead of the common cu&s;tom of this country, inclo&s;ing it with bands of &s;traw, which &s;traw, when it has heated in the mow or &s;tack, gives the cider a bad flavour. And in order to avoid a great deal of trouble, and to perform the work more effectually, by dive&s;ting the new made cider of what pummice and other impurities which remain; after &s;training it through a hair &s;ieve, on its coming from the pre&s;s, it is
<PB N="254" REF="026198_0262_0FCF583903692B40">
nece&s;&s;ary to be provided with a large open vat, which will contain a whole making, or as much as can be pre&s;&s;ed in one day. Af|ter the cider has remained in this vat a day, or &s;ome times le&s;s, according to the ripene&s;s of the fruit, of which it has been made, and the &s;tate of the weather, you will find ri&s;e to the top, the pummice or gro&s;&s;er parts of the pulp, &amp;c. of the apples; and in a day or two more, at mo&s;t, grow very thick; and when little white bubbles or fermentations of the bigne&s;s of the top of your finger, break through it, then pre&s;ently draw it off through a cock or faucet hole, within three inches of the bottom, that the lees may not be drawn off, but quietly remain behind.</P>
<P>If the cider is not immediately drawn off, on the fir&s;t appearance of the&s;e white fer|mentations, all the head, which is then be|come a thick cru&s;t, will &s;ink to the bottom; &s;o that, if this cri&s;is, which happens but once of the fir&s;t &s;eparation of the cider from its lees is neglected, the opportunity of making &s;weet cider will be lo&s;t and irrecoverable.</P>
<P>On drawing off the cider from the vat, it mu&s;t be tunned into clo&s;e ca&s;ks well &s;cented, and a match burnt in them before the cider is put in.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="026198_0263_0FD0329DD982E628">To have cider perfectly &s;weet, after it is tunned into clo&s;e casks, you are again care|fully to watch and ob&s;erve its &s;tate, and when you find white bubbles or fermentations as afore&s;aid, at the bung-hole, immediately rack it off again into another clean and well &s;cent|ted ca&s;k; after which mo&s;t probable, it will be March before it ferments again, when it mu&s;t be racked off as before: and to hinder its fermenting again, put a handful in each barrel, of powdered loam or clay, and to &s;trengthen and make it keep, put a quart of apple brandy into each barrel; and every ca&s;k mu&s;t be filled up to the bung, and clo&s;ely bunged down.</P>

<HEAD><HI>FOR MAKING</HI> and <HI>PLAISHING</HI> of HEDGES.</HEAD>
<P>This manner of fencing will be found a cheap and excellent method, and if properly made will excel a po&s;t and rail fence, for no &s;ort of cattle can go through it, neither will they attempt to leap over it. On many plan|tations they have not wood enough to make po&s;ts and rails for fencing, therefore are at a great expence in purcha&s;ing of them. There are very few plantations but has &s;ufficent for hedging; and tho&s;e that have not, may in a little time rai&s;e enough, by &s;owing acorns, the haw, or beech, or planting of alder, wil|low, poplar, &amp;c. where the hedge, or hedge row is intended; for the large&s;t wood that is required, need not be above four or five inches in circumference.</P>
<P>The method of making this hedge or fence is as follows: fir&s;t dig a trench or ditch, three feet wide at top, which &s;hould be dug down in a &s;loping manner, till it comes to two feet
<PB N="262" REF="026198_0270_0FD032A8DDC8BD98">
at bottom, and the ditch &s;hould be two feet deep, where the ground will admit of its be|ing dug &s;o deep. There &s;hould be three or four layers of turf laid upon one another on the top of the edge of the trench, on that &s;ide you intend to make the hedge, and the mould that is dug out of the ditch &s;hould be thrown up on the turf, to make a bank for the hedge; the turf that is placed on the edge grows, and the roots of the turf extend them|&s;elves into the bank, which prevents the fro&s;t in the winter from making it &s;carf in.</P>
<P>On the top of this bank, nine or ten inches from the edge, the hedge is made; fir&s;t cut the &s;takes five feet long, of any &s;ort of wood, from two inches and a half, to five inches in circumference. If the &s;takes exceed five feet in length that will not &s;ignify, as the tops may be cut off to their proper length after the hedge is fini&s;hed. The bottom of tho&s;e &s;takes &s;hould be cut &s;harp in a three &s;quare manner. They &s;hould then be drove in the bank with a maul about eighteen inches deep and not to exceed two feet apart between them; if they are put in a &s;traight line, they will look the better.</P>
<P>Then cut the eithers, which &s;hould be out of your longe&s;t and &s;traite&s;t poles, and pretty
<PB N="263" REF="026198_0271_0FD032AB62BA7CD8">
&s;tout, but not &s;o &s;tout as the &s;takes; the&s;e eithers are for putting on the top in a wick|er manner, to keep the bru&s;h in tight that is put between the &s;takes.</P>
<P>In cutting out the&s;e &s;takes, and eithers, you will cut a good deal of bru&s;h, which will all do for filling up; you mu&s;t cut &s;ome more &s;mall bru&s;h, to have a &s;ufficient quantity. This bru&s;h &s;hould be twin|ed in between the &s;takes in a wicker manner as well as the eithers, that is before one &s;take, and behind the next, and &s;o on, and it &s;hould be pre&s;&s;ed down tight. All the live wood that is growing near the hedge, and can be lain down and trained to it, &s;hould be cut about half off, and laid down in the hedge among the bru&s;h in a wicker manner as be|fore directed; and if there is any vines, twine them in the &s;ame manner: all tho&s;e will make fre&s;h &s;hoots, and grow up in the hedge, and &s;trengthen and make it more la&s;ting.</P>
<P>This hedge will la&s;t &s;ix years, and by that time your wood where you cut, will be grown up again, and will &s;erve to make a new fence. The ditch on the &s;ide of the fence, may be made to &s;erve two purpo&s;es; for where the land is wet, and wants draining, it will &s;erve for that purpo&s;e, and carry off the wa|ter.</P>

<HEAD>How to manage and fatten Cows, Oxen, Sheep, Hogs, Calves, and Lambs.</HEAD>
<P>Fir&s;t cows, and oxen. Cows very much vary, not only in their make and &s;hape, but al&s;o in their bags or udders, which the buyer &s;hould have a particular regard to: &s;ome have their leathers thick and fle&s;hy, others thin and lainge. The thick leathered one will often &s;eem big, and give but little milk, and that very hard to be got, when, a thinner one &s;hall give much more, and be ea&s;ily milked; therefore when a per&s;on is ma&s;ter of a right cow, it concerns him to keep her on; cows if well kept, will pay on an average about &s;ix pounds a year. In the winter, when you cant get gra&s;s for your cows, give them tur|nips, potatoes, grains, or malt du&s;t; all of which are great breeders of milk; the malt du&s;t mu&s;t be prepared as follows: to one cow put two quarts in a tub, pouring boiling water on it, and &s;o three times a day.</P>
<P>A cow in a middling ca&s;e, that is fed with &s;traw in the winter, need not have hay above a month before &s;he calves, for that &s;he will give more milk than if &s;he had it longer; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="265" REF="026198_0273_0FD032B4F93F0780">
the fatter the cow, the le&s;s the milk; and yet, if too poor, it is dangerous, lea&s;t &s;he falls in calving; a heifer will &s;pring about three months before &s;he calves, but a &s;even years old cow only three weeks; as &s;oon as &s;he has calved, throw a handful of &s;alt on each &s;ide of the calf, which the cow will &s;wal|low, by licking of it; this will cau&s;e her to glean &s;peedily.</P>
<P>When a cow is bulled, as &s;oon as it can be done, when &s;he comes home, throw a pail of cold water on her udder behind, and keep her up from any other that night, becau&s;e &s;he will be apt to ride them, and &s;o mi&s;s her bul|ling.</P>
<P>If you would fat a cow that has calved in the &s;pring-time, dry her the beginning of Augu&s;t, and then &s;he will get fat with the af|ter-pa&s;ture. Bullocks turned in to the pa&s;|ture at the &s;ame time may be fatted. Cows and bullocks may be fatted in the winter in &s;talls with turnips and oil cake; they &s;hould be both chopped &s;mall. Let them have as many turnips as they will eat, and two quarts of the oil cake twice a day; they &s;hould have a little good hay now and then to brouze on.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="026198_0274_0FD032B60FE53AA8">Sheep, are a cattle that are kept at the lea&s;t expence of any to the farmer, and will thrive upon almo&s;t any ground, and for this rea&s;on they ought to be prefered before the larger cattle. The be&s;t &s;ort of &s;heep for fine wool are tho&s;e bred on high dry ground. The mar&s;hes or low lands breed larger &s;heep, but their wool is not &s;o good.</P>
<P>The farmer &s;hould always buy his &s;heep from a wor&s;e land than his own; they &s;hould be big boned, and have a long grea&s;y wool, curling clo&s;e and well. Tho&s;e &s;heep always breed the fine&s;t wool, and are al&s;o the mo&s;t approved of by the butcher, or &s;ale in the market.</P>
<P>For the choice of &s;heep to breed, the ram mu&s;t be young, and his &s;kin of the &s;ame co|lour with his wool, for the lambs will be of the &s;ame colour with his &s;kin. He &s;hould have a large long body, a broad forehead, round and well ri&s;ing, large eyes and &s;traight and &s;hort nor&s;trils.</P>
<P>The polled &s;heep, that is tho&s;e that have no horns are found to be the be&s;t breeders. The ewe &s;hould have a broad back, a large bending neck, &s;mall, but &s;hort, clean and nim|ble legs, and a thick deep wool covering her
<PB N="267" REF="026198_0275_0FD032C107C90EA8">
all over. To know whether they be &s;ound or not examine the wool, that none of it be want|ing, and &s;ee that the gums be red, the teeth white and even, and the bri&s;ket &s;kin red, the wool firm, the breath &s;weet, and the feet not hot. Two years old is the be&s;t time for begin|ning to breed, and the fir&s;t lambs &s;hould not be kept too long to weaken them by &s;uckling; but be &s;old as &s;oon as conveniently may be. They will breed advantageou&s;ly till they are &s;even years old.</P>
<P>To know the age of a &s;heep, look in his mouth the &s;ame as in a hor&s;e's; when he is one &s;hear, he has two broad teeth before; when it is two &s;hear it will have four; when three, &s;ix; when four, eight; after this their mouth begins to break.</P>
<P>As to the time of putting the rams to the ews, the farmer mu&s;t con&s;ider at what time of the &s;pring his gra&s;s will be fit to maintain them and their lambs, and whether he has tur|nips to do it till the gra&s;s comes; for very of|ten both the ewes and lambs are de&s;troyed by the want of food. Many thou&s;ands of lambs and many ewes are lo&s;t &s;ome winters in this country from the &s;ame cau&s;e. If the lambs are only &s;tunted in their growth by it, it is an accident that they never recover. Num|bers
<PB N="268" REF="026198_0276_0FD032C1E0034C18">
in my travels la&s;t winter and &s;pring com|plained to me of their lo&s;ing their lambs dai|ly. They &s;aid the ewe would not take to the lamb, or let it &s;uck, and that they never knew any thing like it. The rea&s;on was obvious to me; the ewe was &s;tarved, therefore had no milk for her lamb, which was the rea&s;on of her running from it, and taking no notice of her young.</P>
<P>The ewe goes twenty weeks with lamb, and according to this it is ea&s;y to calculate the proper time you would have them to yean in.</P>
<P>Ewes that are big &s;hould be kept but bare, for it is very dangerous to them to be fat at the time of their bringing forth their young. They &s;hould be well fed indeed, like cows, a fortnight before hand, to put them in heart.</P>
<P>The method of fattening &s;heep and lambs on turnips you will find by turning back to the account given of the turnip and penning of &s;heep. I have only to add that there &s;hould be racks and mangers placed in the field that may be ea&s;ily moved; in the racks there &s;hould be &s;ome good upland hay, and in the man|ger
<PB N="269" REF="026198_0277_0FD032D12B1A4D40">
&s;ome grain. The tare or vetch is the be&s;t.</P>
<P>There is another method of fattening lambs, which is done in the hou&s;e, therefore it is called hou&s;e lamb; it is more delicate than that fatted in the field; which makes it fetch a greater price. This is done by &s;uck|ling; the ewes are brought into the hou&s;e to them twice a day, perhaps two or three for each lamb, that they may have their bellies full: they are fa&s;tened by their head, that they cannot run from the lambs.</P>
<P>Sheep, as well as bullocks and cows, &s;hould frequently have &s;alt given them, which purifies the blood and keeps them in health.</P>
<P>Hogs are one of the mo&s;t increa&s;ing and profitable &s;pecies of animals that can be kept on a farm, therefore de&s;erve the hu&s;band-man's particular attention. From experience I have found that &s;wine prefer &s;aintfoin and lucerne, to clover; tho&s;e gra&s;&s;es will fatten them with a &s;mall quantity of corn, peas, or beans. Potatoes boiled in an iron pan, mix|ed with a &s;mall quantity of Indian, pea, or bean meal, is a good fatner for them. Peas makes the meat of &s;wine &s;weeter and firmer
<PB N="270" REF="026198_0278_0FD032D696EBA148">
than any other diet whatever. Pumpkins with a &s;mall quantity of corn or grain, will likewi&s;e fatten them.</P>
<P>When they are fattening in pens, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary twice or thrice a week to add about three table &s;poons full of &s;alt, to half a bu&s;hel pail full of food, which a&s;&s;i&s;ts dige&s;tion, con|&s;olidates their food, and increa&s;es their appe|tites. About once a week, I have mixed two &s;poons full of madder, which prevents ob|&s;tructions, and on &s;ome other day in the week I give an equal quantity of flowers of &s;alt pe|tre and &s;ulphur well pounded and mixed; which purifies and cools the blood; which entirely prevents the meazles, keeps the &s;wine extremely healthy, and fattens them more expeditiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Calves may be made very fat by the fol|lowing method: The fir&s;t week they &s;hould not have their fill; but afterwards as much as they will &s;uck; at three weeks or a month they &s;hould &s;uck two cows; when they are five or &s;ix weeks old, they &s;hould have three cows to &s;uck.</P>
<P>The calf &s;hould be kept in a clo&s;e pen, &s;heltered at much as po&s;&s;ible from the cold and the light, and have &s;ome clean wheat|en
<PB N="271" REF="026198_0279_0FD032DC5D6256C0">
&s;traw every day to lay down on, &s;hould have &s;ome powdered chalk, with &s;ome whea|ten flour in a trough, and &s;ome large pieces of chalk hung up for the calves to lick at plea&s;ure, in order to whiten their fle&s;h, make them &s;uck, and keep them from being laxa|tive; and if then they &s;hould &s;cour, (which hinders their fattening) give them four oun|ces of bole armonic, powdered and mixed with milk, through a horn.</P>
<P>Give them now and then &s;ome black pep|per mixed with urine, to cau&s;e a drought, that they may &s;uck the more, and with bleeding them often, helps to fatten them the &s;ooner. Bleed them when a month old; at &s;ix weeks do the &s;ame again; and &s;o every week after you keep them, it whitens their fle&s;h, and makes them fatter with le&s;s milk. I have had calves by the&s;e means at &s;even weeks old has weighed better than three hundred weight; which I have &s;old to the butcher for 7l. 15s. &s;terling.</P>
<P>There are two ways of breeding calves that are intended to be reared: the one is to let the calf run with its dam all the year round: this is the method in the cheap breeding coun|tries, and is generally allowed to make the be&s;t cattle.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="026198_0280_0FD032DDAA462C90">The other way is to take them from the dam after they have &s;ucked about a fortnight, they are then to be taught to drink fleet milk which is to be made but ju&s;t warm for them, it being very dangerous to give it them too hot.</P>
<P>The be&s;t time for weaning of calves is from January to May; they &s;hould have milk for twelve weeks after, and a fortnight before that is left off, water &s;hould be mixed with the milk in larger and larger quantities. When the calf has fed on milk about a month, little whi&s;ps of hay &s;hould be placed all about him in cleft &s;ticks to induce him to eat.</P>
<P>The latter end of April or beginning of May, they &s;hould be turned out to gra&s;s only for a few days; they &s;hould be taken in for the night, and have milk and water given them; the &s;ame may be al&s;o given them in a pail &s;ometimes in the field, till they are able to feed them&s;elves, that they do not regard it. The gra&s;s they are turn|ed into mu&s;t not be too rank, but &s;hort and &s;weet, that they may like it and yet get it with &s;ome labour.</P>
<P>Calves &s;hould be always weaned at gra&s;s, for if it be done with hay and water, they
<PB N="273" REF="026198_0281_0FD032DF4BCC66A8">
often grow big bellied on it, and are apt to rot. When tho&s;e among the males are &s;e|lected which are to be kept as bulls, the re&s;t &s;hould be gelded for oxen: the &s;ooner the better, twenty days old is a very good time.</P>

<P>The colts produced from the&s;e &s;hould not be u&s;ed as &s;tallions, for they will degenerate, and the race will &s;oon become exactly the &s;ame as this country breed. If a barb is not to be had, an Engli&s;h or Spani&s;h Hor&s;e is to be cho&s;en.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t backing of a hor&s;e is a thing of great con&s;equence, as his value afterwards very much depends on it. After a colt has been exerci&s;ed &s;ome time morning and even|ing, and becomes &s;omewhat obedient, he is to be taken to &s;ome plowed lands, the light|er the better; he mu&s;t be made to trot over the&s;e in the hand, by that means to tire him and abate his wantonne&s;s. When this is done, care mu&s;t be taken that all the tack|ling be good and firm, and every thing in its due and proper place; then a per&s;on is to hold his head, and another to mount him, but this mu&s;t not be done &s;uddenly, or at a jerk, but very gradually and &s;lowly, by &s;eve|ral half-ri&s;ings and heavings. If he bears this patiently, the per&s;on is to &s;eat him&s;elf firmly on his back; but, if he be trouble&s;ome and
<PB N="277" REF="026198_0285_0FD032EE9E6E7F30">
not tamed enough, the per&s;on is to forbear the attempt to mount, and he is to be trot|ted hard in the hand over the &s;ame plowed lands again, till he is willing to receive the rider quietly on his back. When this is done, the per&s;on who is on his back mu&s;t che|ri&s;h him, and the man who has his head mu&s;t lead him a few paces forward; then he is to be cheri&s;hed again.</P>
<P>The feet are to be fitted well in the &s;tirrups and the toes turned out; afterwards the ri|der is to &s;hrink and move him&s;elf in the &s;ad|dle, and the per&s;on who holds his head is to withdraw his hand a little further from the mouth.</P>
<P>As the rider moves his toes forward, the holder mu&s;t move him forward with the rein, till he is made to apprehend the rider's moti|on of body and foot, which mu&s;t always go together, and with &s;pirit, and will go for|ward without the other's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;tay upon the re&s;traint of the rider's hands. When this is accompli&s;hed let him be cheri&s;hed and have gra&s;s and bread to eat; and then let the rider mount and alight &s;everal times, cheri&s;h|ing him between each time; and thus he is to be managed till he will go on or &s;tand &s;till, at plea&s;ure.

<HEAD>FATTENING OF HORSES.</HEAD>
<P>The being able to do this &s;peedily requires &s;ome art, and indeed is one of the greate&s;t niceties of the whole management of that creature.</P>
<P>There is many methods; but the following may be mo&s;t depended on: Take elecampane, cimmon &s;eed, tamari&s;k, and ani&s;eed, of each two ounces, common ground&s;el one handful. Boil all the&s;e very well, with two hands full of garlic &s;craped and cleaned, in a gallon of good beer; &s;train the liquor well off, and give the hor&s;e a quart of it every morning made hot;
<PB N="279" REF="026198_0287_0FD032F9C0365628">
keep him warm after it. After he has taken this for four or five mornings, he may be turned out to gra&s;s, or kept in the hou&s;e as the &s;ea|&s;on will permit; but whenever provender is given him, a quantity of a powder is to be prepared of equal parts of cummin &s;eeds and elecampane, and give him half an ounce of it every time, &s;prinkling it in by degrees, as he eats, that he may not nau&s;eate the whole.</P>
<P>If this method does not &s;ucceed in a &s;hort time, then take two &s;poons full of diapente; brew it in a pint of &s;weet wine, and give it the hor&s;e for three mornings. This will take off any inward &s;ickne&s;s, and make the other things take effect. After this, feed him with good provender three times a day: that is, af|ter his watering in the morning, after his wa|tering in the evening, and at nine o'clock at night. If he does not eat the provender well and freely, it mu&s;t be changed for &s;ome other kind.</P>
<P>If all this does not &s;ucceed, let the hor&s;e be blooded; and then take half a bu&s;hel of coar&s;e barley meal, put it into a pail full of water, and &s;tir the whole together very well, then let it &s;ettle by &s;tanding. Pour off the clear liquor into another ve&s;&s;el, and let him drink it for his common drink, and eat the
<PB N="280" REF="026198_0288_0FCF584B05E95228">
remainder which falls to the bottom of the pail.</P>
<P>If he refu&s;e to eat this alone, there may be &s;ome bran mixed among it. This &s;hould be given him three times a day, morning, noon, and night. If he does not rightly take to the meal with the bran, &s;ome oats mu&s;t be mix|ed with it, and this will readily bring him to feed on it; but which ever way is u&s;ed, they mu&s;t be by degrees dimini&s;hed in quantity, till at length he is brought to eat the meal alone; for that is the thing that mu&s;t fatten him up.</P>
<P>Care mu&s;t be taken that the barley be fre&s;h ground, for it quickly grows &s;our; and when this has once been the ca&s;e with one parcel, no art will ever bring the hor&s;e to touch it afterwards. Scarce any hor&s;e but will be fattened by keeping him to this diet about twenty days. Barley cools and purges the creature; but the greate&s;t efficacy, as to the fattening him, lies in the water, which by this management takes up all the rich part of the barley into it&s;elf.</P>
<P>When the hor&s;e grows lu&s;ty on this diet, it mu&s;t be taken from him by degrees; giv|ing
<PB N="281" REF="026198_0289_0FCF584D1FA07B38">
him at fir&s;t oats at once, and barley meal twice a day; and then oats twice, and the barley meal once, till he is perfectly weaned from it. In the mean time he mu&s;t have good hay, and he mu&s;t not be rid, only it will be proper to walk him gently about an hour or two in the heat of the day.</P>
<P>If it be found that the hor&s;e wants a good &s;mart purging during the time of his continu|ing on the barley diet, the be&s;t time to give it him is after the fir&s;t eight days, and the following is a very proper &s;ort of phy&s;ic: take of the fine&s;t aloes one ounce, agaric in pow|der half an ounce, and powder of florentine orris one ounce. Let all the&s;e be mixed to|gether, and put into a quart of milk warm from the cow. This will work very bri&s;kly, and after it is over, the u&s;ual diet is to be con|tinued. Give him a pint of lin&s;eed, or half a pint of lin&s;eed oil mixed with his feed now and then, which will keep him clear from the botts, as well as the more &s;peedily fatten him.</P>

<P>This is known from his teeth, hoof, coat, tail, and ears. The fir&s;t year he has only

&s;mall grinders and gatherers, of a brighti&s;h co|lour, which are called foal's teeth. The &s;e|cond year he changes his four foremo&s;t teeth, viz. two above, and two below, and they ap|pear browner and bigger than the re&s;t. The third year he changes the teeth next the&s;e, leaving no apparent foal's teeth before, but two above and two below on each &s;ide, which are all bright and &s;mall. The fourth year he changes the teeth next the&s;e, and leaves no more foal's teeth before, but one above and one below on each &s;ide. The fifth year his foremo&s;t teeth are all changed, and the tu&s;hes on each &s;ide are complete; and tho&s;e which &s;ucceed the la&s;t foal's teeth are hollow, with a &s;mall black &s;peck in the middle, which is called the mark in a hor&s;e's mouth, and continues till he is eight years old. The &s;ixth year there ap|pears new tu&s;hes, near which is vi&s;ible &s;ome young fle&s;h, at the bottom of the tu&s;h; the tu&s;hes being white, &s;mall, &s;hort and &s;harp. The &s;eventh year his teeth are at their full growth, and the mark in his mouth appears very plain. At eight, all his teeth are full, plain, and &s;mooth, and the black mark but ju&s;t di&s;cernable; the tu&s;hes looking more yellow than ordinary. The ninth, his fore|mo&s;t teeth &s;hew longer, broader, yellower, and fouler than before, the mark quite di&s;ap|pearing,
<PB N="283" REF="026198_0291_0FD0330284F19448">
and the tu&s;hes blunti&s;h. At ten, no holes are felt on the in&s;ide of the upper tu&s;hes, which till then are ea&s;ily felt. At eleven, his teeth are very long, yellow, black, and foul, and &s;tand directly oppo&s;ite each other. At twelve, the teeth of his upper jaw hang over tho&s;e of his under. At thirteen, his tu&s;hes are worn almo&s;t clo&s;e to his chaps if he has been much ridden; otherwi&s;e they will be long, black and foul.</P>
<P>With regard to the hoof: if it be &s;mooth, moi&s;t, hollow, and well &s;ounding, it is a &s;ign of youth; but if, on the contrary, it be rugged and as it were covered with &s;eams one above another, and withal, dry, foul and cru&s;ty, it is a &s;ign of old age. If a joint about the &s;tern of the tail, near the but|tock be felt to &s;tick out more than the re&s;t by the bigne&s;s of a nut, you may conclude him under ten, but if the joints are all &s;mooth, he may be fifteen. If the eyes are round, full, and, as it were &s;tarting from his head, having no pits over them, but &s;mooth and even with his temples, and free from wrinkles, both under and above, it is a certain mark of his youth.</P>

<P>ANTICOR is a dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, pro|ceeding from a fulne&s;s or inflammation of the blood, occa&s;ioned by high feeding, without exerci&s;e, or by over hard riding.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="026198_0293_0FD0330AD1B9F2D8">In this di&s;ea&s;e the corrupt and inflamed blood rai&s;es a &s;welling in the middle of the brea&s;t, ju&s;t again&s;t the heart. Upon the fir&s;t appearance of the &s;welling, a large quantity of blood &s;hould be taken from the palate veins, or, if they lie hid, from both &s;ides of the neck. Then give to drink diapente with beer, adding thereto one ounce of &s;ugar can|dy, and half an ounce of treacle. Anoint the &s;welling every day with a mixture of ba|&s;ilicon and hogs lard; and when the &s;well|ing is &s;oft, let out the pus or matter, wa&s;hing it with copperas water; then heal the &s;ore in the common manner.</P>
<P>BOTTS are a &s;pecies of worms which in|fe&s;t hor&s;es more in this country, than any other. They have large heads and little tails, and generally breed in the &s;traight gut, near, the fundament: which if not de&s;troyed, are the death of the creature.</P>
<P>To prevent their breeding, give your hor&s;es in the &s;pring and fall, one ounce of powder|ed antimony and three ounces of the flour of brim&s;tone, which will not only prevent the botts breeding, but al&s;o purify their blood. And at times make a decoction of &s;pice wood: that is, cut the &s;pice wood &s;mall, and boil it in water, and the decoction or liquor
<PB N="286" REF="026198_0294_0FCF584EC6C8B5A8">
mixed with the hor&s;e's feed, and now and then a pint of flax-&s;eed. By this method, your creatures will always be kept healthy, and free from botts.</P>
<P>If the botts &s;hould have got ahead, and are trouble&s;ome to the hor&s;e, (which may be known by his unea&s;ine&s;s and fri&s;king of his tail) get one ounce of the be&s;t indigo, and divide it into two do&s;es; when powdered, give him one in the morning and the other in the evening: or, get a handful of the leaves of tobacco, and chop them &s;mall, and give it him in his feed.</P>
<P>The FARCIN proceeds from different cau|&s;es; as from feeding on unwhole&s;ome hay, corn, or grain; from too high feeding, with|out &s;uitable exerci&s;e; from over hard riding attended with &s;udden heats and colds; or from infection from another hor&s;e. It is a kind of venom or corruption of the blood, that appears in form of knots or cords along the veins, and by ulcers; the&s;e la&s;t are cured with a red hot iron; and the former by bleeding, purging and proper exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>The be&s;t preparation for the Farcin is, to &s;teep the regulus of antimony in beer, with a little of the &s;pice called the grains of para|radi&s;e,
<PB N="287" REF="026198_0295_0FCF58528A20AAA8">
and a little &s;ugar; of which give a hor&s;e about half a pint at a time, three times a day, with a day or two's intermi&s;&s;ion be|tween each day.</P>
<P>The GLANDERS con&s;i&s;ts in a running of corrupt matter from the no&s;e, being fir&s;t white, then yellow, green, and la&s;tly black, when at its utmo&s;t malignity. It procceeds from various cau&s;es; from infection, a di&s;or|der in the lungs, &s;pleen, liver and brain, and in its la&s;t &s;tage from the &s;pine, and hence it is called the mourning of the chine.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;tage of this di&s;ea&s;e it may be ea&s;ily cured, as its chief &s;eat is in a little, &s;oft, &s;pongy fle&s;h which is ea&s;ily dilated by the lea&s;t influx of blood. In the la&s;t &s;tages there is no cure.</P>
<P>GRAVELLING is a di&s;order which tra|velling hor&s;es are liable to; when little gravel &s;tones get in between the hoof and the &s;hoe, they &s;ettle to the quick, and fret and fe&s;ter the part. It is cured by pulling off the &s;hoe, picking out the gravel, and drawing the place to the quick, then &s;topping up the foot with hor&s;e-grea&s;e and hot turpen|tine.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="026198_0296_0FD0330C72F9CA18">GALLING is very trouble&s;ome to the hor&s;e and rider on a journey, and the be&s;t hor&s;es are mo&s;t &s;ubject to it; &s;o that it con|cerns every traveller that goes long journies to prevent it, which may be done if the &s;ad|dle fits well, and take a hind's or deer's &s;kin, well furni&s;hed with hair, and fit it neatly be|neath the pannel of the &s;addle, &s;o that the hai|ry &s;ide may be next to the hor&s;e; this does not harden by &s;weat, but keeps the hor&s;e from galling. This is al&s;o a method that &s;hould never be omitted with hor&s;es that are newly cured of &s;uch a hurt, as it will prevent their falling into it again.</P>
<P>It is always proper to take off the &s;addle as &s;oon as the hor&s;e is brought in, and if in hot weather, to wa&s;h his back with cold wa|ter, and examine whether the back be at all pre&s;&s;ed, or pinched in any part: and it will be well to examine it an hour after, to &s;ee what effect the &s;tanding has had; for often the part hurt will not &s;hew it at fir&s;t, but will &s;well violently afterwards. In this ca&s;e, where the &s;kin is not fretted, but a &s;welling comes on, a bag of coar&s;e cloth &s;hould be fil|led with hor&s;e-dung, and tied on the &s;wel|ling, which will not only prevent it from growing wor&s;e, but will take it quite down; or rub the &s;welling with good brandy, laying
<PB N="289" REF="026198_0297_0FCF585105535B88">
on a paper &s;oaked in it. If the &s;kin be bro|ken, a mixture of red wine and &s;allad oil, is a good remedy.</P>
<P>The HAW is a gri&s;tle growing between the nether eye-lid and the eye, which, if not timely extirpated, will put the eye entirely out. It owes its origin to tough phlegmatic humours, which falling from the head, and uniting together, form, at la&s;t, this infirmity.</P>
<P>The method of cure is as follows: The creature is to be held fa&s;t by the head, and a needle with a &s;trong thread, is to be thru&s;t through the upper eye-lid, and tied to his mane. Then the needle with a long thread, mu&s;t be thru&s;t through the haw, and the &s;kin cut round it with a &s;harp knife: the haw is plucked out by means of the thread; after which the eye mu&s;t be clean&s;ed from the blood, and wa&s;hed with beer, with &s;alt di&s;|&s;olved in it.</P>
<P>The hoof of a hor&s;e is liable to many infir|mities, &s;uch as ca&s;ting of the hoof, hoof-bound, hoof-loo&s;end, hoof-&s;welled, and brittle-hoof|ed.</P>
<P>Ca&s;ting of the hoof, is when the whole cof|fin of the hoof becomes loo&s;ened, and falls off
<PB N="290" REF="026198_0298_0FCF5DB8504471A8">
from the bone. This ari&s;es from &s;ome prick, &s;tub, foundering, &s;urbating, &amp;c. that cau&s;es an impo&s;thumation in the foot, whereby the hoof, and &s;ometimes the coffin-bone, being &s;pungy, falls off in large pieces.</P>
<P>Hoof-bound is the &s;hrinking in of the hoof a-top and at the heel, which makes the &s;kin grow over it. It is cau&s;ed by keeping a hor&s;e too dry in the &s;table, &s;traight-&s;hoeing, or &s;ome unnatural heat after foundering.</P>
<P>Hoof-loo&s;ened, is a dividing of the horn of a hor&s;e's hoof from the fle&s;h, at the &s;etting on of the coronet. If the part|ing be round about the coronet, it comes by foundering; if in part, then by a prick, quit|ter-bone, gravelling, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Hoof-&s;welled, is an infirmity that befals young hor&s;es, when over ridden, or wrought hard, which makes the hoof &s;well, by rea&s;on of the blood falling down and &s;et|tling there; which, if not &s;peedily removed, begets a wet &s;pavin.</P>
<P>The brittle-hoof comes &s;ometimes natural|ly, and &s;ometimes artificially. When it comes naturally, it is generally hereditary, the &s;ire or dam having had the &s;ame com|plaint.
<PB N="291" REF="026198_0299_0FCF5DB98C71BEC8">
When it comes on accidentally, it is &s;ometimes owing to a di&s;temper falling down into the feet; and &s;ometimes to the creature's being much foundered. The hoof, in this di&s;tember, is &s;o friable and rotten, as it were, that it cracks and flakes off on eve|ry &s;light occa&s;ion. The cure in the&s;e &s;everal di&s;orders is as follows: take bees wax, refined turpentine, &s;uet, and hogs lard, of each four ounces; &s;allad oil a quarter of a pint, and of dog's grea&s;e, half a pound; let the whole be melted together and &s;trained through a piece of canva&s;s into a gallipot. The hoof is to be thoroughly anointed with this every day, morning and evening, e&s;pecially at the root; and, if there are any large cracks, they mu&s;t be filled up at every dre&s;&s;ing, with a mixture of equal parts of cows-dung and hogs lard.</P>
<P>The LAMPERS is a &s;welling in a hor&s;e's palate, that hinders the creature from feed|ing, and makes him let his oats or corn fall half chewed out of his mouth. It ari&s;es from abundance of blood re&s;orting to the fir&s;t fur|row of the mouth, and from heat, &amp;c. The cure is by burning it with a red hot iron, and afterwards anointing the place with olive oil.</P>

The other two on the in&s;ide of the hoof under the joint. The two former is called the ox and dry &s;pa|vin, and the two latter is called the bloody or wet &s;pavin, and the bone &s;pavin. The ox &s;pavin is a callous tumor hard as a bone, and very painful. The dry &s;pavin is more ea&s;ily perceived by the hor&s;es rai&s;ing one of his hind legs, with a twich, higher than the other. The blood &s;pavin is a &s;oft tumor which grows through a hor&s;e's hoof, and is u&s;ually full of blood. The bone &s;pavin is a cru&s;ty &s;ub|&s;tance growing on the in&s;ide of the hoof un|der the joint. The ox and dry &s;pavin is oc|ca&s;ioned by a kick or &s;ome hurt, and the blood and bone &s;pavin, by &s;ome infirmity in the hoof. The method of cure is by bli&s;tering the part, and if that does not cure it, firing is the only re&s;ource left.</P>

The wind galls that are &s;ituated near the &s;inews, are much the mo&s;t painful of all, and &s;oone&s;t make the hor&s;e lame. The ge|neral cau&s;e of wind-galls is extreme work, or violent exerci&s;e in very hot weather, and tho&s;e hor&s;es which have long joints are mo&s;t &s;ubject to wind-galls.</P>
<P>The method of cure is to open the &s;well|ing about the length of a bean, and to pre&s;s out the jelly: when this is done, apply a mixture of the oil of bays and the white of an egg, covering it with tow. Another me|thod is, after the jelly is all &s;queezed out, to wrap round the part a woolen cloth, then applying a hot iron; this is to be rubbed over till all the moi&s;ture is carried away; it is then to be daubed all over with pitch, ma&s;tick, and re&s;in boiled together, laying tow in plen|ty over all.</P>
<P>The roweling of hor&s;es is a method of cure frequently had recour&s;e to in inward

&s;trains, as well as tho&s;e about the &s;houlders and hips, as al&s;o for hard &s;wellings not ea&s;ily to be re&s;olved. I &s;hall therefore give proper directions for rowelling. The operation is thus: a little &s;lit being made through the &s;kin, about a hand's breadth below the part aggrieved, big enough to put a turkey's quill in. The &s;kin is rai&s;ed from the fle&s;h, the end of the quill put in, and the &s;kin blown from the fle&s;h upwards, and all over the &s;houlder. Then the hole being &s;topped with the finger, the place blown is beaten with a &s;mall &s;tick, and the wind &s;pread with the hand all over, then let go. This done, hor&s;e hair, or red &s;ar&s;enet, half the thickne&s;s of the little finger, is put in a roweling needle, &s;even or eight inches long; the needle is put into the hole, and drawn through again &s;ix or &s;even inches higher; then the needle is drawn out, and the two ends of the rowel tied together, anointing it every day, as well as before the putting it in, with fre&s;h butter and hogs grea&s;e and drawing it backwards and forwards in the &s;kin, to make the putrid matter di&s;charge it&s;elf more plentifully.</P>
<P>Hor&s;e balls is a cordial medicine, admini|&s;tered in the form of balls, of great virtue for feeding and &s;trengthening &s;ound, as well as healing and rai&s;ing un&s;ound hor&s;es&mdash;the pre|paration

<P>For a cow that &s;trains in calving, when her calf haulm, udder, or bag will come down and &s;well, as much as a blown bladder.

feet; then let a woman anoint her hand with hogs lard, and work the calf's haulm from the bladder, that the water may have a pa&s;|&s;age, give her warm bedding, warm drinks, and warm cloths.</P>
<P>For a cow that cannot glean&mdash;Take ger|mander and pennyoyal, a large handful of each, half an ounce of ginger, and one drachm of &s;affron, boiled in three pints of beer; &s;train it, and when cooled, give it her to drink.</P>
<P>For a cow that pi&s;&s;es blood&mdash;Take oak, &s;have off the outer bark, and boil it in &s;pring water till it be red; al&s;o comfrey, &s;hepherd's pur&s;e, plantain, &s;age, green hemp or nettles, of each a good handful, and boil them with the bark; &s;train it, and put a handful of &s;alt in|to the water; al&s;o, &s;ome allum, bole armoniac and chalk. If the bea&s;t is weak, give only a quart luke-warm; but if &s;trong, more; once given often &s;erves, but twice will &s;urely cure.</P>
<P>For the black or red water in cows; a di&s;|temper next to the pi&s;&s;ing of blood&mdash;Take a piece of iron, heat it hot in the fire, and put it into two quarts of milk; after let the milk cool, and give it the bea&s;t blood warm, and it

will bind up the bloody i&s;&s;ue, after two or three times giving.</P>
<P>For the blain in cows&mdash;When fir&s;t taken, they will &s;tare, and foam with their tongues out of their mouths; then immediately prick her in the no&s;e, or bleed her in the neck, which will keep her alive twenty-four hours; then take a handful of &s;alt in about a pint of water, and give it her, then directly ram a whole egg down her throat. Sometimes they have it behind, under their tail, when a bli|&s;ter will appear; this is cured by running a hand down her fundament clo&s;e fingered, and brought wide out; which breaks the blain within; if not di&s;covered pre&s;ently, it kills them in half an hour &s;ometimes.</P>
<P>To cure &s;wellings, or &s;narled bags of cows. &mdash;Take rue, and adder's-tongue, &s;tamp them together, and &s;queeze out the juice; this mix with a pound of fre&s;h-butter from the churn, without &s;alt, and make it into an ointment; of which anoint the part affected.</P>
<P>The rot in &s;heep is the greate&s;t misfortune belonging to them. It is cau&s;ed by too much moi&s;ture, by water and &s;nows, which by their weight and di&s;&s;olution, mix and wa&s;h the gra&s;s in with the earth, and &s;o cau&s;e a froth
<PB N="300" REF="026198_0308_0FCF575D52889D18">
or &s;cum, which the &s;heep, through hunger and novelty, greedily devour, to their de&s;truc|tion; it is al&s;o occa&s;ioned, in the &s;pring or &s;ummer, by a putrefaction in the air or gra&s;s, e&s;pecially in the valleys and mar&s;hes, and is known, oftentimes by the cobwebs on the ground, and hedges, which hold a wet, or moi&s;ture, and are of a poi&s;onous nature. The&s;e cau&s;e a corruption in the blood, which breed plai&s;es in the liver and head: this plai&s;e is a live worm, about the breadth of one's finger-nail, and feeds and preys on the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>I have opened &s;heep that have died with the rot, and found the liver all con&s;umed by the&s;e worms.</P>
<P>I had a weather &s;heep took with a giddi|ne&s;s, which increa&s;ed &s;o that it could not &s;tand: I immediately knocked off that horn that lay next the ground, and there appeared a &s;mall bladder, like that of a fi&s;h, which I took out, and put a little wool in the place, dipped in tar, and &s;ewed it up, and the &s;heep did well afterwards.</P>
<P>Rotten &s;heep will, in the beginning of the rot, fatten &s;ooner than &s;ound ones; and the way to know if they are &s;ound, is to feel the
<PB N="301" REF="026198_0309_0FCF5DCA02C7D678">
cod of the weather, and between the legs of the ewe; if they are moi&s;t and wet they are &s;ound: but if there is a dry wax or &s;curf, they are rotten. Al&s;o if the innermo&s;t part of the eye has &s;treaks of red, it is a &s;ign of &s;oundne&s;s. Al&s;o if the gums are red, they are &s;ound; for the gums and mouth of a rot|ten &s;heep are always white.</P>
<P>When the cau&s;e of di&s;tempers are known, remedies are more ea&s;ily pre&s;cribed. I have before &s;hewn that the cau&s;e of the rot is oc|ca&s;ioned by too much moi&s;ture, and their devouring tho&s;e cobwebs that appear early in the morning.</P>
<P>If the &s;heep was not turned into tho&s;e pla|ces till nine or ten o'clock, the &s;un by that time will have exaled or dried up this moi|&s;ture which contains this poi&s;onous quality, &s;o that the &s;heep will not receive any injury; and as a preventative, give them frequently &s;ome good hay, oats, or other grain, and &s;alt two or three times a week. If you find the rot has begun, remove them if you can con|veniently to &s;ome high dry ground, that will often knit and recover them.</P>
<P>To prevent and cure a rotten &s;heep, that is not too far gone.&mdash;Take bay &s;alt, and &s;tamp
<PB N="302" REF="026198_0310_0FCF5DCC899B80D0">
it well, and after the &s;heep has fed a day or two on clean, dry oats, put &s;ome of it among them, and after that a greater quantity, till &s;uch time as they di&s;like it; then give them clean oats a day or two, and, after that, &s;erve them with the &s;alt as before: this cour&s;e being followed, until their eyes have recovered their natural colour, they will be perfectly cu|red.</P>
<P>Another receipt which I &s;eldom found to fail, is the regulus of antimony &s;old at the chymi&s;ts or apothecaries. This regulus of antimony is a univer&s;al remedy for mo&s;t di&s;|&s;ea&s;es in men and bea&s;ts; it is a chemical pre|paration, made with crude antimony, nitre, and tartar, and &s;hould be corrected with &s;pice and &s;ugar. I have before mentioned it for the cure of the farcin or farcy in hor&s;es. Take this regulus of antimony, and &s;teep it in beer, with a little of the &s;pice called grains of paradi&s;e, and a little &s;ugar; give it two or three times, with a day or two's intermi&s;&s;ion between each time. To a &s;heep, about two or three ounces at a time. This mu&s;t be done in time, before the liver is too much knotted, and that may be partly known, by killing one, by which a judgment may be made of the re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="026198_0311_0FCF576065274AA0">Another receipt to prevent the rot in &s;heep. Take a peck of malt and ma&s;h it, the &s;ame as you brew it into beer, and make about ten gallons of liquor: then boil in this liquor, a good quantity of herbs, &s;uch as &s;hepherds-pur&s;e, comfrey, &s;age, plantain, penny-royal, wormwood and bloodwort, of each a good quantity, and boil them in the &s;aid liquor very well; then &s;train them and put a little yea&s;t therein; and after that put a peck of &s;alt, and tun, and put it up in a ve&s;&s;el. Then give it your &s;heep in the &s;pring or fall in wet weather; &s;even or eight &s;poonfuls apiece once every week. If the weather is dry, you need not give it them &s;o often. If you give them now and then a lick of tar mixed with herb-de-grace chopped, it will clean&s;e the bowels of much corruption, and be healthful to the blood.</P>
<P>For the &s;kit or loo&s;ne&s;s in &s;heep&mdash;Take &s;alt, allum and chalk, and give it in &s;mall drink or water, and it will knit and help them pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>By frequently &s;eeing my &s;heep in the pen collect together in a circular manner, with their heads or no&s;es clo&s;e to one another, made me make ob&s;ervations to know what could be the rea&s;on. I have &s;een large flies about the heads
<PB N="304" REF="026198_0312_0FCF5DCE88C197A8">
of the &s;heep, and their attention or directi|on &s;eemed to be at the no&s;e of the &s;heep, which was the cau&s;e of the &s;heep huddling &s;o clo&s;e together to prevent them. This fe|male fly, when &s;he has been impregnated by the male, knows that the no&s;e of a &s;heep is the only place for her to depo&s;it her eggs, in order to their coming to good. The fron|tal &s;inu&s;es above the no&s;e in &s;heep are the places where the&s;e worms live and attain their full growth. The&s;e &s;inu&s;es are always full of a &s;oft white matter, which furni&s;hes the&s;e worms with a proper nouri&s;hment, and are &s;ufficiently large for their habitation; and when they have here acquired their de|&s;tined growth, and come to the &s;tate in which they are fit to undergo their changes for the fly-&s;tate, they leave their old habitation, and falling to the earth, bury them&s;elves there; when the&s;e are hatched into flies.</P>
<P>The head of a &s;heep makes a good di&s;h: but the&s;e live worms found in the head, (which is mi&s;taken by many for maggots) has brought that part of the &s;heep into di&s;repute. I hap|pily found a remedy which prevented the fly from laying her eggs; which was mixing flour of brim&s;tone with &s;alt, and giving it fre|quently to the &s;heep to lick. The fumes of the brim&s;tone a&s;cending into that part of the
<PB N="305" REF="026198_0313_0FCF5DD001360B18">
head made it noxious to the fly. My &s;heep afterwards fattened much &s;ooner; for the worms plagued them much by tickling the part, which might be &s;een by the &s;heeps un|ea&s;ine&s;s, and frequently &s;haking their heads.</P>
<P>To cure the &s;cab or itch, all maggots, and worm in the claw. Let the &s;heep blood in the eye veins. Take tar and hogs lard of each a like quantity, mix them well together with &s;ome flour of brim&s;tone and the juice of cherville; bring it to a &s;alve, and with the &s;ame (after you have bared, clean&s;ed, and made all the &s;ore places raw) anoint all the griev|ed places.</P>
<P>To cure broken bones, or bones out of joint. After you have placed the member right (which you may do by the example of the &s;ound member) bathe the grieved place well with butter and beer; then make a &s;ear-cloth of patch-grea&s;e and yellow wax, and warm|ing it very hot, lap it about the member, and if need require, &s;plinter it; and in ca&s;e the member be broken, renew it not till fifteen days be pa&s;t, otherwi&s;e once in three days.</P>
<P>To cure griefs in the mouth, and loo&s;ene&s;s of teeth. Let the &s;heep blood in the gums, then take of earth, &s;age, and &s;alt of each an equal

I have frequently &s;old them for more than what I have bought a fre&s;h one for, as they have been fat and fit for the butcher; you will find it will be to your advantage to have no bulls.</P>
<P>For one hundred cows, you mu&s;t erect two &s;heds ri&s;ing &s;ufficiently in the middle to carry off the water; the height in the middle may be twelve feet, and the &s;ides &s;even feet, and the breadth thirty feet; each of the &s;heds &s;hould be one hundred and twenty-five feet long; and under the highe&s;t part, directly in the middle, mu&s;t be a partition, which will &s;upport the ridge of the roof; on either &s;ide of the partition, let there be fixed a rack like tho&s;e in &s;tables, which is to run the whole length of the &s;hed, and mu&s;t be pla|ced as high as a cow can reach her fodder from.

<HEAD>VINEYARD.</HEAD>
<P>The be&s;t &s;ituation for a vine-yard is on the declivity of a hill lying to the South: and the &s;oil mo&s;t &s;uitable, is the hotte&s;t gravel, &s;and, or dry rocky ground, provided it be well wa|tered and &s;haded. To mend a &s;oil that wants tho&s;e qualities, it is good to throw in the rubbi&s;h of old buildings, well mixed with twice as much earth, and &s;ifted about the roots of the vines. The vines mo&s;t &s;uitable for the midling or colder climates are the white Mu&s;cadine, the Burgundy, the Claret, the Par&s;ly, the Mu&s;cadine, the white and red Frontigniac, and the Arbois, or French &s;weet water grapes. The &s;outhern climates will produce all the re&s;t as well as tho&s;e.</P>
<P>The vine is propagated by &s;lips, layers, or cuttings. If you propagate them by cuttings, let &s;uch be cho&s;en as are &s;trong, and well ri|pened &s;hoots, of the la&s;t year's growth, and &s;hould be cut in the fall of the year, from an old vine, ju&s;t below the place where they were produced, taking a knot of the two years

wood, which &s;hould be pruned &s;mooth. The upper part of the &s;hoot mu&s;t be cut off, &s;o as to leave the cutting about &s;ixteen inches long. If for exportation the lower parts of the&s;e cuttings mu&s;t be put in mould in a tub and &s;hould be kept in &s;ome part of the &s;hip till their arrival where the air could be ad|mitted to them. If cut for a new plantation, in the &s;ame place the&s;e cuttings are to be plac|ed, with their lower part in the ground in a dry place, laying &s;ome litter about their roots to prevent them from drying. In this place they &s;hould remain to the begin|ning of April, which is the time to plant them. They are then to be taken up and wiped clean, and their lower parts to &s;tand in water &s;ix or eight hours. Then having prepared your ground to receive them. They are to be planted in lines running North and South, five or &s;ix feet a part; only two vines in each hole. You mu&s;t have &s;pare ones in your nur&s;ery, to make good them that mi&s;s; tho&s;e you have planted mu&s;t be kept clean from weeds. The fall following, if the cuttings have produced &s;trong &s;hoots, they &s;hould be pruned down to two eyes. In the &s;pring following the ground is carefully to be dug up about the &s;hoots, and the &s;talks to be earthed up to the fir&s;t eye. During the &s;um|mer all the lateral &s;hoots mu&s;t be rubbed off

as they appear, and only the two from the two eyes, which were left mu&s;t be encourag|ed; the&s;e as they grow, mu&s;t be &s;upported, with &s;takes and laths in the manner of an e&s;palier; and in the middle of July the&s;e mu&s;t be &s;hortened by nipping off their tops, and this will greatly &s;trengthen the &s;hoots. In the following fall the&s;e &s;hould be pruned, leaving them each three eyes, if they are &s;trong, but if they are weakly, only two. The next &s;ummer there will be two &s;hoots from each &s;hoot of la&s;t year's wood; but if there &s;hould be two from one eye, which is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, then the weaker is to be rubbed off. At mid&s;umer the ends of the &s;hoots are to be picked off, as before; all the weak lateral &s;hoots, are to be di&s;placed, as in the preceding &s;ummer; and the whole management is to be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>If, notwith&s;tanding due pruning, they do not &s;eem inclinable to bear large bunches, the ground mu&s;t be helped with a dre&s;&s;ing from the compo&s;t heap, with an equal quan|tity of drift or other &s;and. Thus managed, a vineyard in five or &s;ix years will produce a good &s;tore of grapes.</P>
<P>A vine-yard at Bath, in Great-Britain, containing about &s;ix acres of ground, planted

with white mu&s;cadine and black clu&s;ter grapes, by &s;uch management as before men|tioned, has produced or yielded &s;ixty hog&s;|heads of wine at a vintage; as good wine, and as fine flavored as any ever import|ed.</P>
<P>As to the management of grown vines, it is to be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e rarely produce any bearing &s;hoots, from wood that is more than a year old, the great care mu&s;t therefore be, always to have plenty of this wood in every part of the tree.</P>
<P>The bearing &s;hoots for the following year, &s;hould be left at the pruning with four eyes each. The under one of the&s;e does not bear, and con&s;equently there are only three which do. Many leave more eyes on the &s;hoots, that they may have the more fruit, which is the con&s;equence; but then the fruit is much poorer; and this is &s;o well known in the wine countries, that there are laws to direct, that no more than &s;uch a number of eyes are to be left on each &s;hoot, for the grapes would el&s;e be of a poor juice, and de&s;troy the repu|tation of the wine.</P>
<P>Each of the three eyes left, will produce two or three branches; &s;o that each &s;hoot
<PB N="319" REF="026198_0327_0FCF5DE141AEA230">
will produce &s;ix of nine bunches, which is as much as it can bring to any perfec|tion.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;hoots mu&s;t be laid in at about eighteen inches a&s;under on the e&s;palier; for if they are clo&s;er, when the &s;ide &s;hoots are produced, there will be no room to train them in again&s;t the e&s;palier: and the largene&s;s of the leaves of the vine, requires al&s;o that the &s;hoots &s;hould be at a proportionable di|&s;tance.</P>
<P>The be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for pruning vines is in October. The cut is always to be made ju&s;t above the eye, and &s;loped backwards from it, that if it bleed, the juice may not run upon the bud; and where there is an opportunity of cutting down &s;ome young &s;hoots to two eyes, to produce vigorous &s;hoots for the next year's bearing, it &s;hould always be done.</P>
<P>In May, when the vines are &s;hooting, they &s;hould be looked over, and all the &s;hoots from the old wood rubbed off, and al&s;o the weak|er, whenever there are two produced from one eye.&mdash;During the month of May, the branches mu&s;t be fa&s;tened to the e&s;pali|ers, with withes or ba&s;s, as they &s;hoot; and to|wards the latter end of the month, the ends

of the bearing branches &s;hould be nipped off, which will greatly &s;trengthen the fruit. Tho&s;e, however, which are to bear the next year, &s;hould not be topped before the begin|ning of July.</P>

<HEAD>WINE.</HEAD>
<P>The difference of flavour, ta&s;te, colour, and body, in wines, is as much owing to the different manner and time of pre&s;&s;ing, ga|thering, &amp;c. the grape, as to any difference of the grape it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In Hungary, whence tockay and &s;ome of the riche&s;t and highe&s;t flavored wines come, they are extremely curious in the&s;e re&s;pects. For their prime and mo&s;t delicate wines, the grape is &s;uffered to continue upon the vine, till it is half dried by the heat of the &s;un; and if the &s;un's heat &s;hould not prove &s;ufficient, they are dried by the gentle heat of a furnace, and then picked one by one from the &s;talks. The juice of this grape, when pre&s;&s;ed out, is of a fine flavour, and &s;weet as &s;ugar; this, after due fermentation, is kept for a year, and then racked from the lees, when it proves a
<PB N="321" REF="026198_0329_0FCF5DE444A73D08">
generous, oily, rich wine, and is &s;old at a ve|ry high rate.</P>
<P>The Hungarians prepare a &s;econd &s;ort of wine, by collecting together the better kind of grapes, carefully picking the grapes from the &s;talks, and then pre&s;&s;ing out the juice.&mdash; This is extremely &s;weet, and is made richer by infu&s;ing in it after it has fermented &s;ome days a &s;ufficient quantity of half-dried grapes. This wine is very &s;weet, oily, and of a grate|ful ta&s;te, and retains the&s;e qualities for a long time. There is a third &s;ort made from the pure juice of the &s;ame kind of grape, without any addition. This is a more bri&s;k and live|ly wine, and far le&s;s &s;weet.</P>
<P>They likewi&s;e prepare a fourth &s;ort, from grapes of different goodne&s;s mixed together; this, though not &s;o generous, is neverthele&s;s an excellent wine.&mdash;The&s;e Hungarian wines are remarkable for pre&s;erving their &s;weetne&s;s, and for the delicacy of their ta&s;te, and &s;mell; they likewi&s;e do not grow ea&s;ily vapid, and may be kept in perfection for ma|ny years.</P>

<P>Rai&s;ins are the fruit of the vine &s;uffered to remain on the tree till perfectly ripened, and then dried, either in the &s;un, or by the addi|tional heat of the oven.

<P>The difference between rai&s;ins dried in the &s;un, and tho&s;e dried in ovens, is very con&s;i|derable and obvious. The former are &s;weet and plea&s;ant, the others have a whiti&s;hne&s;s, and a latent acidity, with the &s;weetne&s;s that renders them much le&s;s agreeable.</P>
<P>The rai&s;ins of the &s;un, and what is called jar rai&s;ins, from their being imported in ear|then jars, are all of the former kind.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="026198_0331_0FCF5DE5C41516F8">The common rai&s;ins are the fruit of &s;eve|ral &s;pecies of grape, which are better or wor&s;e, according as they have been more or le&s;s carefully cured, by drying them in ovens.</P>

<HEAD>FIGS.</HEAD>
<P>The fig-tree, ficas vulgaris, or ficus &s;ativa, in botany, is one of the cryptogamia of Li|naes, and the abores flore fructuque aggrega|to of Ray. The&s;e trees are propagated from the &s;eeds: the method is to &s;ow the &s;eeds in the nur&s;ery at one foot di&s;tance in the rows, and four feet between. When planted out, if in warm countries, they are planted as &s;tandards; but in colder climates, they are
<PB N="324" REF="026198_0332_0FCF5DE91E4102A8">
generally planted again&s;t walls or e&s;paliers. Its flowers are contained within the very fruit it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The e&s;paliers will be be&s;t for the middling and colder parts of this country; but to the &s;outhward, &s;tandards.</P>
<P>In Germany, although &s;o cold a climate, they are cultivated to a great advantage. Their method is, in the fall of the year to untie the fig-tree from the e&s;palier and lay them down, covering them from the fro&s;t with &s;traw or litter, which prevents their &s;hoots from being injured by the fro&s;t; and this covering is taken away gradually in the &s;pring, and not wholly removed, until all the danger of fro&s;t is over; by which manage|ment they generally have a very great crop of figs.</P>
<P>In Italy and the other warm countries, the fir&s;t crop of figs is little regarded, being few in number; for it is the &s;econd crop of figs, which are produced from the &s;hoots of the &s;ame year, which is the principal crop there.</P>
<P>It is &s;ingular that the wounding of the fruit of the fig by in&s;ects is a great means of its ripening well. In &s;ome of the i&s;lands of
<PB N="325" REF="026198_0333_0FCF5DEB4870C440">
the Levant, they collect the fruit of the wild fig in June or July, at which time the worms, produced in them by the eggs of in|&s;ects, begin to change into flies. They hang the&s;e fruits on the branches of the dome&s;tic fig-tree; and the flies, as they come out of them, naturally &s;ettle upon the growing figs about them, making punctures or wounds in the fruit, which cau&s;es them to ripen in much greater numbers and perfection than they otherwi&s;e would. But the&s;e figs are baked, before they are packed up for u&s;e, in order to de&s;troy the eggs depo&s;ited in them by the flies, which would otherwi&s;e hatch into worms and &s;poil them. The be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for pruning of fig-trees is in autumn, becau&s;e, at that time the branches are not &s;o full of &s;ap; &s;o they wiil not bleed &s;o much, as when they are pru|ned in the &s;pring, and, at this &s;ea&s;on the bran|ches &s;hould be dive&s;ted of all the atumnal figs; and, the &s;ooner this is done when the leaves begin to fall off, the better will the young &s;hoots re&s;i&s;t the cold of the winter.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons &s;o cold and moi&s;t that the young &s;hoots of the fig-tree will not harden, but are &s;oft and full of juice; when this happens, there is little hopes of a crop of figs the &s;ucceeding year; for the fir&s;t fro&s;t in the fall will kill the upper part of the&s;e &s;hoots for a con&s;iderable length downwards: when|ever
<PB N="326" REF="026198_0334_0FCF5DEC90540DC0">
this happens it is the be&s;t way to cut off all the decayed parts of the &s;hoots, which will prevent the infection, from de&s;troying all the lower part of the branches; and by this me|thod I have &s;een a moderate crop of figs put out from the lower part of the &s;hoots, where if the &s;hoots had not been injured, there would have been no fruit produced; becau&s;e it is chiefly from the four or five uppermo&s;t joints of the &s;hoots that the fruit comes out; and it is for this rea&s;on, that as many of the &s;hort lateral branches &s;hould be pre&s;erved as po&s;&s;ible: tho&s;e being the mo&s;t productive of fruit; for where the long &s;traight &s;hoots are fa&s;tened up, there will be no fruit, but at their extremities; &s;o that all the lower parts of the trees will be naked, if there is not a particu|lar regard had to &s;upply young &s;hoots in eve|ry part of the tree.</P>
<P>The trees which are laid down from the e&s;pa|liers, &s;hould not be fa&s;tened up again, till the beginning of April, for the rea&s;ons before gi|ven: during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on the&s;e trees will require no pruning, but the branches are often blown down by winds; therefore, when|ever this happens, they &s;hould immediately be fa&s;tened up again, otherwi&s;e they will be in danger of breaking; for the leaves of the&s;e trees being very large and &s;tiff, the wind has
<PB N="327" REF="026198_0335_0FCF576DC1B11EE8">
great power on them: &s;o that where the bran|ches are not well &s;ecured, they are frequently torn down</P>
<P>Tho&s;e trees which are planted again&s;t e&s;|paliers, may be protected from the injury of fro&s;t in the &s;pring, by placing reeds on each &s;ide of the e&s;palier, which may be taken down every day, and put up again at night; but this need not be practi&s;ed in warm weather, but only at &s;uch times as there are cold winds, and fro&s;ty mornings; and, although there is &s;ome trouble and expence attending this management, yet the plentiful crops of figs, which may be this way obtained, will &s;uffici|ently recompence for both.</P>
<P>The be&s;t way of making this covering is, to fa&s;ten the reeds with rope yarn, in &s;uch a manner, as that it may be rolled up like a mat, &s;o that the whole may be with facility be put up, or taken down; and if the&s;e reeds are carefully rolled up, after the &s;ea&s;on for u&s;ing them is over, and put up in a dry place, they will la&s;t &s;everal years.</P>
<P>There is another method, by fa&s;tening as many of the branches together as can be conveniently brought into a bundle, and winding &s;ome hay or &s;traw bands round
<PB N="328" REF="026198_0336_0FCF5774C36C7ED0">
them, which in the &s;pring may be gradually taken off, &s;o as not to expo&s;e the &s;hoots all at once to the open air; and if there is &s;ome &s;uch light covering, laid round the &s;tems, and upon the &s;urface of the ground, about their roots, it will more effectually &s;ecure them from the dangers of fro&s;t; but when this is practi&s;ed, great care &s;hould be taken, that no mice, or rats, harbour in this covering; for the&s;e will eat off the bark from their &s;hoots, and kill them.</P>
<P>The fig is cured in much the &s;ame man|ner as the grape into rai&s;ins. They mu&s;t fir&s;t be dried in the &s;un, and then put in the oven, to kill the in&s;ect, that breeds in them.</P>

only in the warmer countries, as Spain, and particularly Barbary, flowering in the &s;pring, and the fruit is ripe in Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>Almonds are chiefly of two kinds, &s;weet and bitter.&mdash;The &s;pecies are: 1. Amygdalus &s;ativa, fructu majore. C. B. P. the common large almond. 2. Amygdalus dulcis, putamine mollion. C. B.

<P>They are propagated by inoculating a bud of the&s;e trees into a plumb, almond, or peach &s;tock, in the month of July. (The manner of this operation you will find under the article Inoculating, page 236.) The next &s;pring, when the bud &s;hoots, you may train them up either for &s;tandards, or &s;uffer them to grow for half &s;tandards; though the be&s;t me|thod is to bud them to the height the &s;tems are intended to be; and the &s;econd year, af|ter budding, they may be removed to the places where they are to remain.</P>
<P>The be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for tran&s;planting of them (if for dry ground) is in October, as &s;oon as the leaves begin to decay: but for a wet &s;oil, March or beginning of April is much prefer|able; and ob&s;erve always to bud upon plumb

A great deal of it is adulte|rated with a mixture of &s;and and other filth. If it is good it will be firm but not tough, hard, and when broke, of a fine, &s;hining &s;urface, &s;uch as perfectly melts in the mouth, and does not ta&s;te of burning, nor leaves any har&s;h or gritty particles between the teeth.</P>
<P>The cultivation of this plant is as follows: &mdash;The ground de&s;igned for it mu&s;t be well dug and dunged the year before, that the dung may be thoroughly rotted in it&punc; and ju&s;t before it is planted the earth is to be dug three &s;pades deep, and laid very light. The plants to be &s;et mu&s;t be taken from the &s;ides or heads of the old roots, and each mu&s;t have a very good bud or eye, or otherwi&s;e they are &s;ubject to mi&s;carry; they &s;hould al&s;o be about ten inches long, and perfectly &s;ound.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on for planting them is as early in the &s;pring as the weather will admit, and this mu&s;t be done in the following manner: the rows mu&s;t be marked by a line drawn acro&s;s

the bed at two feet di&s;tance; and the plants mu&s;t be &s;et in the&s;e rows, by making a hole of their full depth and &s;omething more, and the eye of the root may be an inch below the &s;urface; they mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;et two feet di|&s;tance from each other in the rows. When this is done, the ground may be &s;own over with onions or turnips, which not rooting deep, will do the liquorice roots no injury for the fir&s;t year.</P>
<P>In the fall, when the &s;talks of the liquorice are dead, a little very rotten dung &s;hould be &s;pread over the &s;urface of the ground. Three years after the time of planting, the liquorice will be fit to take up for u&s;e; and this &s;hould be done ju&s;t when the &s;talks are dead off: for, if taken up &s;ooner, the roots are very apt to &s;hrink greatly in their weight.&mdash;There is one nece&s;&s;ary caution, that is, the ground mu&s;t be kept hoed, and free from weeds.</P>
<P>The manner of preparing the juice in Spain is this: they take up the roots in the month of July, they clean them perfectly as &s;oon as taken out of the earth, and then hang them up in the air till nearly dry; after this they cut them into thin &s;lices, and boil them in water till the decoction is very &s;trong; they then pre&s;s it hard out to obtain all the juice

They &s;et this de|coction by to &s;ettle a little, and when it has depo&s;ited its coar&s;e&s;t parts, they pour it off into ve&s;&s;els, in which they evaporate it over a fire &s;trong at fir&s;t, but milder afterwards, till it becomes of the con&s;i&s;tence of a thick extract; they then let the fire go out, and, when the extract is &s;o cool that they can han|dle it, they take out large parcels at a time, and working them well in the hands, they roll them out into long cylindric ma&s;&s;es, which they cut out into &s;uch lengths as they plea&s;e, rolling them over a parcel of half dri|ed bay leaves, which pick up enough of them for a covering, which are in that condition laid in the &s;un till perfectly dried; there is great nicety required, at the end of the eva|poration to get the extract to a proper con|&s;i&s;tence without letting it burn.</P>

<HEAD>MADDER.</HEAD>
<P>Madder is a &s;mall red root u&s;ed in medi|cine and dying.&mdash;The plant which produ|ces the madder root is of the number of the tetrandia monogynia of Lynnaeus, and one of the herbae &s;tillatae of Mr. Ray.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="026198_0342_0FCF5DF66C35AC38">It grows to two feet high, its &s;talks are &s;quare and rough; its leaves are oblong and narrow, and &s;tand four in a joint in the man|ner of a &s;tar. Its flowers grows in clu&s;ters at the upper parts of the &s;talks, are very &s;mall and of a pale yellowi&s;h green colour; the&s;e are followed by a fruit con&s;i&s;ting of two &s;eeds. It has been de&s;cribed by all the botanical writers under the names of rubia &s;tava, and rubia tinctorum.</P>
<P>Madder is cultivated in va&s;t quantitities in &s;everal parts of Holland; the Dutch &s;upply all Europe with it, and make a va&s;t advan|tage of the trade in it; it is very wonderful no other nation has attempted the cultivating of it, as it would &s;ucceed in almo&s;t any coun|try, particularly in this, and much ground might be employed in this way, to ten times the advantage it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>A flat loamy &s;oil &s;uits it be&s;t.&mdash;The me|thod of cultivating this u&s;eful plant, as prac|ti&s;ed by the Dutch, is as follows: In the fall of the year, they plow the land where they intend to plant madder in the &s;pring, and lay it in high ridges, that the fro&s;t may mel|low it.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="026198_0343_0FCF5DF7C1D544D0">In march they harrow it down and plow it again; and at this &s;ea&s;on they work it ve|ry deep, laying it up in ridges eighteen inch|es a&s;under, and about a foot high; then about the beginning of April, when the madder will begin to &s;hoot out of the ground, they open the earth about their old roots, and take off all the &s;ide &s;hoots, which extend them&s;elves ho|rizontal, ju&s;t under the &s;urface of the ground, pre&s;erving as much root to them as po&s;|ble; the&s;e they tran&s;plant immediately up|on the tops of the new ridges, at about a foot apart, ob&s;erving always to do this, when there are &s;ome &s;howers, becau&s;e then the plants will take root in a few days, and will require no water.</P>
<P>When the plants are growing, they care|fully keep the ground hoed, to prevent the weeds from coming up between them; for if they are &s;mothered with weeds, e&s;pecially when young, it will either de&s;troy or weaken them &s;o much, that they &s;eldom do well after. In the&s;e ridges they let the plants remain two &s;ea&s;ons, during which time they keep the ground very clean; and in the fall, when the tops of the plants are decayed, they take up the roots and dry them for &s;ale.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="026198_0344_0FCF5772DF69EA78">The experiments I have made on the cul|ture of madder in England, convinces me there is no nece&s;&s;ity for planting it on ridges, except the land is very wet, as is the ca&s;e in general in Holland, where their land is often floated in winter. In dry land the be&s;t me|thod is to plow between the ridges, therefore &s;hould be planted at a greater di&s;tance, than is practi&s;ed by the Dutch. The rows &s;hould be four feet between, and the plants eighteen inches a&s;under in the rows, as they extend them&s;elves pretty far under ground; for where they are planted too near, their roots will not have room to grow. For I find, that if all the horizontal roots are de&s;troyed from time to time, as they are produced, it will cau&s;e the large downright roots to be much bigger, in which the goodne&s;s of this com|modity chiefly con&s;i&s;ts; for, if the upper roots are &s;uffered to remain, they will draw off the principal nouri&s;hment from the down|right roots, as I have experienced; for I plan|ted a few roots upon the &s;ame &s;oil, and &s;itu|ation, which were of equal &s;trength, and rooted equally as well: half of the&s;e I hoed round, and cut off the horizontal roots, and the other half I permitted the horizontal roots to remain on; and when I took them all up, tho&s;e which I had hoed about, and kept clear from horizontal roots, were almo&s;t as large
<PB N="337" REF="026198_0345_0FCF5DFA03EE0EC8">
again as the other, and the roots were double the weight; which plainly proves the nece&s;|&s;ity of cutting off tho&s;e &s;uperfluous roots, &s;o that where this plant is cultivated in quanti|ty, it will be an excellent method to u&s;e the hoe-plow I have before de&s;cribed: for with this in&s;trument a large quantity of ground may be kept clean at a &s;mall expence: and as this will &s;tir the ground much deeper than a common hoe, it will cut the &s;uperficial roots and thereby improve the principal roots.</P>
<P>The crop of madder &s;hould be &s;hifted into fre&s;h land; for the ground which has had but one crop, will not be fit to receive ano|ther in le&s;s than four years; during which time, any other annual crop may be cultivated on the land.</P>
<P>The manner in Holland, of drying and preparing the&s;e roots for u&s;e, is as follows. They pare off the out&s;ide rind of the roots, which is dried by it&s;elf, and is called mull madder. Then they pare off another fle&s;hy part of the root, which is made into another madder, and is called number O: but the in|&s;ide or heart of the root, is called crop mad|der. The fir&s;t &s;ort is worth about twenty &s;hillings per hundred weight, the &s;econd &s;ort
<PB N="338" REF="026198_0346_0FCF5DFBBADB71A0">
about forty &s;hillings, and the third &s;ort five pounds. This method I believe they do not now practice: but the whole is dried and ground together, which an&s;wers the dyers purpo&s;e full as well.</P>
<P>The&s;e roots mu&s;t be dried on a kiln, be|fore they are ground to powder. What is for medicinal u&s;e, comes in the whole root, which is only dryed, without any prepa|ration.</P>
<P>By my experiments which I made, I ima|gine that one acre of good madder when fit to take up for u&s;e, will be worth upwards of one hundred pounds. So that it will well pay for any method of culture; but if per|formed by the plow, will be no great expence, the principal charge being, in the fir&s;t pre|paring of the land, and the planting.</P>

It is of a tolerable &s;mooth and even &s;urface, and externally of a faint yellow colour, with a large admixture of brown; it is moderately heavy, but not hard: when fre&s;h cut, it is found to be of a mar|bled and variegated appearance; its colours are a pale, but bright yellow, and a faint red|di&s;h; the yellow is the ground colour, and the red is di&s;po&s;ed in &s;hort irregular veins, much in the manner of the darker colour in the common nutmeg.</P>
<P>It is of a &s;omewhat lax and &s;pongy texture; it has an agreeable, and &s;omewhat aromatic &s;mell, and a bitteri&s;h, a&s;tringent, and &s;ubacid ta&s;te.</P>

It flowers in June, and ripens the &s;eed in July and Augu&s;t. It is produced in great plenty on the confines of China and Tartary, and in many parts of Tartary it&s;elf: the mountains of Tibet abound with it, and a very con&s;iderable part of what is &s;ent to Europe and America grows there. This plant will grow be&s;t in high, dry, warm land; it will &s;tand the &s;evere&s;t colds unhurt.</P>

<P><PB N="341" REF="026198_0349_0FCF5782020B8B58">The Chine&s;e are very careful in their man|ner of drying it; they take up the root only in winter, or early in the &s;pring before the leaves begin to appear; they then cut it into &s;mall pieces as they think proper&punc; and lay it on a table in a &s;hady place, turning it once or twice a day, for two or three days; after this they &s;tring the pieces on a cord at a di|&s;tance from one another, and then hang them up in a &s;hady place, where they may dry lei|&s;urely. It is by this management the rhu|barb is rendered &s;o firm and &s;olid as we find it; for, if it were hung up to dry at once in a warm airy place, it would become light and &s;pongy; likewi&s;e if the roots were to be taken up in &s;ummer, they would be light and of lit|tle value, and would not have the reddi&s;h marbling: which is one of the greate&s;t cha|racters of its goodne&s;s.</P>

<P>The crocus, or plant which produces it, is one of the triandria monogynia of Lynnaeus, and one of the herbae bulbo&s;a radice praedi|tae of Mr. Ray.

<P>The land where it is intended to be culti|vated, &s;hould be in an open, level country, the &s;oil not poor, nor a very &s;tiff clay, but a temperate dry mould, of a hazle colour, or of a loamy nature. The ground being made choice of, about the latter end of March, or beginning of April (according to the &s;ea&s;on) it mu&s;t be carefully plowed, the furrows be|ing drawn much clo&s;er together, and deeper, if the &s;oil will allow it, than is done for any &s;ort of grain.&mdash;About five weeeks after, or during any time in the month of May, lay between twenty and thirty loads of &s;hort rotten dung, or manure from the compo&s;t heap upon each acre; and having &s;pread it with great care, plow it in as before. About mid&s;ummer, plow a third time, and between every &s;ixteen feet and half, or pole in breadth, leave a broad furrow or trench, which &s;erves both as a boundary to the &s;everal parcels, and to throw the weeds in at the proper &s;ea|&s;on.</P>
<P>The next general part of the culture of &s;a|fron, is planting or &s;etting the roots: the be&s;t in&s;trument to be u&s;ed for which is a narrow &s;pade, commonly termed a &s;pit-&s;hovel. The
<PB N="347" REF="026198_0355_0FCF5E0543CD09A8">
time for planting is in July, a little &s;ooner or later, according as the weather an&s;wers. The method is this: one man with his &s;pit-&s;hovel rai&s;es between three or four inches of earth, and throws it before him, about &s;ix or more inches: two per&s;ons, (women or boys will do) following with heads, place them in the farthe&s;t edge of the trench he makes, at four inches di&s;tance from each other, or thereabouts. As &s;oon as the dig|ger or &s;pitter has gone once the breadth of the ridge, he is to begin again at the other &s;ide, and digging, as before, covers the root la&s;t &s;et, and makes the &s;ame room for the &s;etters to place a new row, at the &s;ame di|&s;tance from the fir&s;t, as they are from one another. Thus they are to go on till a whole ridge is planted; and the only nicety, in digging is, to leave &s;ome part of the fir&s;t &s;tra|tum of earth untouched, to lie under the roots, and, in &s;etting, to place the roots directly upon their bottom. There &s;hould be &s;ome regard had to the &s;ize of the roots, placing the large&s;t at a greater di&s;tance than the &s;mal|ler ones.</P>
<P>The&s;e roots are to continue in the ground three years; the fir&s;t year the crop will be the lea&s;t. About the mid&s;ummer after the third crop is gathered, the roots mu&s;t all be
<PB N="348" REF="026198_0356_0FCF5E0864501CB0">
taken up, and tran&s;planted into fre&s;h ground, prepared as before mentioned.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t expeditious method is to plow them up with a &s;mall plow that has a narrow earth-board: and people to follow and ga|ther the heads as they are turned up. They are next to be carried to the hou&s;e in &s;acks, and there cleaned: this labour con&s;i&s;ts in cleaning the roots thoroughly from earth, &s;eparating the young &s;uckers or bulbs from the old ones, and from the remains of old roots, old involucra and excre&s;cences; and thus they become fit to be planted in new ground immediately, or to be kept for &s;ome time without danger of &s;poiling. One acre when broke up, will have a &s;ufficient quan|tity of roots to plant four. The young roots or bulbs mu&s;t be planted by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The quantity of roots to be planted on an acre is generally about 128 bu&s;hels, which ac|cording to the di&s;tances left between them, as before a&s;&s;igned, and &s;uppo&s;ing all to be an inch in diameter one with another, ought to amount to 392,040 in number.</P>
<P>From the time that the roots are planted, till about the beginning of September, there is no more labour about them; but as they

then begin to &s;pire, and are ready to &s;how them&s;elves above ground (which is known by digging a few out of the earth) the ground mu&s;t be carefully pared with a &s;harp hoe. The running hoe before de&s;cribed, will be be&s;t, and the weeds, &amp;c. raked into the fur|rows, otherwi&s;e they would hinder the growth of the plants. In &s;ometime after, the &s;affron flowers will appear, which are gather|ed as well before as after they are full blown, and the mo&s;t proper time for this is early in the morning, when the whole flowers are to be gathered, and thrown handful by handful into a ba&s;ket; having then carried home all you have got, immediately &s;pread them up|on a large table, and fall to picking out the filamenta &s;tylis, or chives and together with them a pretty long proportion of the &s;tylus it&s;elf, or &s;tring to which they are joined; the re&s;t of the flower may be thrown away as u&s;e|le&s;s. The next morning return into the field again, whether it be wet or dry weather, and &s;o on daily, till the whole crop be gathered.</P>
<P>The chives being all picked out of the flowers, the next labour about them is to dry them on the kiln. The kiln may be built on a thick plank (that it may be removed from place to place) &s;upported by four &s;hort legs, the out&s;ide of eight pieces of wood, about

inches thick, in form of a quadrangular frame: about twelve inches &s;quare at the bottom, on the in&s;ide, and twenty inches a top; which is likewi&s;e equal to the perpendicular height of it. On the fore&s;ide mu&s;t be a hole about eight &s;quare, and four inches above the plank, through which the fire is to be put in. Over all the re&s;t lay laths pretty thick, clo&s;e to one another and nailed to the frame already mentioned; and then mu&s;t be plai&s;tered over on both &s;ides, as al&s;o the planks at bottom very thick to &s;erve for an hearth. Over the mouth or wide&s;t part, put an hair-cloth, network, or iron wire, fixed to the &s;ides of the kiln; and likewi&s;e to two rollers, or movea|ble pieces of wood, which mu&s;t be turned by wedges or &s;crews, in order to &s;tretch them.</P>
<P>The kiln is to be placed in a light part of the hou&s;e; and you are to begin by laying five or &s;ix &s;heets of white paper on the hair cloth or net work, &amp;c. upon which you mu&s;t &s;pread the wet &s;affron, betweeen two and three inches thick; this is to be covered with other &s;heets of paper, and over the&s;e lay a coar&s;e blanket five or &s;ix times doubled; or in&s;tead thereof a canvas pillow filled with &s;traw; and, after the fire has been lighted
<PB N="351" REF="026198_0359_0FCF577D875895B0">
for &s;ome time, the whole is covered with a board, having a large weight on it.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t you mu&s;t give it a pretty &s;trong heat, to make the chives &s;weat, but mu&s;t be careful you do not &s;corch them, for that will &s;poil all that is in the kiln. When it has been thus dried about an hour, take off the board, blanket and upper papers, and take the &s;af|fron off from that which lies next it; rai&s;ing at the &s;ame time, the edges of the cake with a knife; then, laying on the paper again, &s;lide in another board between the hair cloth, &amp;c. and under papers, and turn both papers and &s;affron up&s;ide down; afterwards cover|ing them, as above.</P>
<P>The &s;ame heat is to be continued for an hour longer; then look at the cake again, free it from the paper, and turn it; then co|ver it, and lay on the weight as before. If nothing happens ami&s;s, during the&s;e two fir&s;t hours, the danger will be over, for there is nothing more to do, but to keep a gentle fire, and to turn the cakes every half hour, till thoroughly dry; for the doing of which as it ought, there are required full twenty four hours.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="026198_0360_0FCF5E0B5C5422E0">The fire may be made of any kind of fuel, but that which &s;mokes the lea&s;t is be&s;t; and charcoal, for that rea&s;on, is preferred to any other.</P>
<P>In England, &s;affron is cultivated in large fields, and is no where rai&s;ed with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s. Their crops frequently paying them &s;ixty pounds per acre. What is con|&s;umed here comes chiefly from England. Which by the proper cultivation they give it, is allowed to be greatly &s;uperior to any other. It is a root that will grow and thrive in any climate and almo&s;t any &s;oil; why then, when the cultivation is properly known, may not a &s;ufficient quantity be rai&s;ed here for our own con&s;umption, if not for exportation.</P>
<P>The&s;e roots or bulbs are very cheap in England: how ea&s;ily they might be import|ed by the &s;pring &s;hips; when they would arrive in proper time for cultivation.</P>

<HEAD>IPECACUANHA.</HEAD>
<P>There are two kinds of ipecacuanha, di&s;|tingui&s;hed by their colour, and brought from different places but both po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ame
<PB N="353" REF="026198_0361_0FCF5E0CE08EBF50">
virtues, though in a different degree; the one of the&s;e is grey, and is brought from Peru; the other is brown, and brought from the Bra&s;ils. The grey or Peruvian ipecacuanha, is a &s;mall and irregular contorted and twi&s;ted root; it is of the thickne&s;s of a &s;mall goo&s;e-quill, and is brought here in pieces of one, two, three, or more inches in length; but the&s;e never &s;traight, but variou&s;ly turned, and wreathed in &s;everal directions. It is of a rough &s;urface, and that in a very particular manner, being rai&s;ed into a &s;ort of annular ridges, at &s;mall di&s;tances from each other, running quite round the root, and ri&s;ing con&s;iderable about the re&s;t of its &s;urface. It is of a den&s;e and firm texture, con&s;iderable hard, though not tough, but breaking on at|tempting to bend it: it is moderately heavy, and does not cut ea&s;ily through with a knife; it is of a du&s;ky greyi&s;h colour, on the &s;urface, and when broken, appears of a clearer and paler grey, and di&s;covers a tough and firm nerve, occupying its centre, and always run|ning its whole length; this nerve or fibre is very &s;mall and &s;lender, of a &s;omewhat pa|ler colour than the re&s;t, and is with much more difficulty reduced to powder; it is le&s;s re&s;inous, and of le&s;s virtue than the cortical part: the whole root is of a very peculiar &s;mell, &s;omewhat pungent, but not di&s;agree|able
<PB N="354" REF="026198_0362_0FCF5780E82D1860">
in ta&s;te: it is acrid, and &s;omewhat bit|teri&s;h, and upon the whole very di&s;agree|able.</P>
<P>The brown or Bra&s;ilian ipecacuanha, is a root much re&s;embling the former in all its characters, but it is, if any thing, more twi&s;t|ed and convoluted: its annual ridges are higher rai&s;ed than in that, and it is a &s;maller as well as &s;horter root; very few pieces of it much exceeding a crow-quill in thickne&s;s, or an inch and an half in length; it is of a deep du&s;ky brown, or blacki&s;h, on the out&s;ide, and white, when broken: it is le&s;s acrid, and has more of the bitter to the ta&s;te than the grey kind, and has le&s;s &s;mell.</P>
<P>Ipecacuanha, though one of the mo&s;t valu|able drugs the materia medica affords us, was not only unknown to the ancients, but even to the modern world, till the middle of la&s;t century. Pi&s;o and Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">grave were the fir&s;t who brought it from South America to Eu|rope; it was celebrated at that time as a cure for di&s;enteries, and got into u&s;e for a few years, but again &s;unk into oblivion, and it was many years before it got into the repu|tation it now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="026198_0363_0FCF5E0E4D14B970">The French were the fir&s;t people in Eu|rope who attempted to introduce it, and they &s;ucceeded very ill with it at fir&s;t, which was owing to their giving it in too large do&s;es. Helvetius, was the man who fir&s;t gave it &s;uc|ce&s;sfully among them, and the French king &s;oon after purcha&s;ed the &s;ecret of him at a large price, and communicated it to the world.</P>
<P>The plant which produces them is of the number of the herboe bacciferae or berry bearing plants of Mr. Ray Plukenet and Morri&s;on have called it a perclymenum, and Linnaeus has named it ouragoga. It ri&s;es to &s;ix, eight, or ten inches high, &s;ometimes to more than a foot; the &s;talks are tender and weak, and have no leaves except near the top, where there &s;tand three or four, &s;eldom more than five; and above the&s;e grow a few mona|petalous flowers, divided into five &s;egments at the edges, which are &s;ucceeded by as ma|ny roundi&s;h umbilicated berries, each con|taining three hard &s;eeds. The root naturally extends to a great length, creeping horizontal|ly under the &s;urface of the ground; the &s;talk &s;eldom &s;tands erect, and the leaves are ob|long, &s;welling in the middle, and &s;mall at both ends; they are about two inches long, and an inch and an half nearly in breadth,
<PB N="356" REF="026198_0364_0FCF5E0FE44E9228">
&s;ometimes larger; they are rough to the touch, and &s;omewhat paler on the under &s;ide than on the upper.</P>
<P>The method of propagating it, is from the &s;eed, which mu&s;t be &s;own in a light rich earth, and when two years old, tran&s;planted into rows at &s;ix inches apart, and four feet between the rows, to admit of the hoe plow to keep them clean from weeds.</P>
<P>The time for planting of them is in the fall of the year. And the &s;econd fall after they are planted, as well as every &s;ucceeeding fall, they are to be dug between with a &s;harp &s;pade cutting off the horizontal roots, which are to be gathered up, cleaned and dried, which will be the true ipecacuanha &s;old in the &s;hops.</P>

<HEAD>OPIUM.</HEAD>
<P>Opium, in pharmacy is an in&s;pi&s;&s;ated juice, partly of the re&s;inous, and partly of the gum|my kind. It is brought to us in cakes or ma&s;&s;es, u&s;ually of a roundi&s;h figure, flatted and covered with poppy leaves. The&s;e are of uncertain &s;izes u&s;ually about an inch thick,
<PB N="357" REF="026198_0365_0FCF5E120A5DA408">
and their weight from eight ounces to a pound.</P>
<P>Opium is very heavy, of a den&s;e texture, not perfectly dry, but more or le&s;s &s;oft, and, commonly, ea&s;ily receiving an impre&s;&s;ion from the finger; it is tough and hard to break, its colour a browni&s;h yellow, &s;o very dark and du&s;ky that in the ma&s;s at fir&s;t &s;ight it appears black, and of a faint, dead, un|plea&s;ant &s;mell, bitter to the ta&s;te, and very a|crid. It is inflammable, yet in great part &s;olu|ble in water: it comes from Natolia, from Egypt, and from the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>The plant which affords opium is one of the polyandria monogynia of Linnaeus, and one of the herbae flore tetrapetalo anomalo of Ray; and is de&s;cribed by all the botanical writers under the name of the white garden poppy, the papaver horten&s;e &s;emine albo, pa|paver &s;ativum dio&s;coridis, and papaver album plinii.</P>
<P>The fields of A&s;ia Minor are in many pla|ces &s;own with the white poppy as ours are with corn. When the heads grow towards maturity, but are yet &s;oft, green, and full of juice, they make inci&s;&s;ions in them with an in&s;trument, which is a kind of a knife with
<PB N="358" REF="026198_0366_0FCF5E1388FF2578">
five edges; this being &s;truck into the head, makes five long cuts in it, from which the opium flows, and is the next day &s;craped off with an edgele&s;s knife, and is put up in a ve&s;&s;el, fa&s;tened to the girdle for that pur|po&s;e; at the time the opium is collected, the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the poppy head is wounded by the &s;ame in&s;trument u&s;ed at fir&s;t, and the opium is collected next day in the &s;ame man|ner.</P>
<P>They di&s;tingui&s;h the produce of the fir&s;t wounds from tho&s;e of the &s;econd, and with great rea&s;on, the fir&s;t being greatly &s;uperior to the &s;econd. They call the fir&s;t flowing of the heads gobaar; it has much more vir|tue than the re&s;t, and is &s;old at a much grea|ter price: Its colour is at fir&s;t white, but af|terwards yellowi&s;h; and when long kept, of a du&s;ky brown. The opium produced from the &s;econd wounds is darker coloured, and approaches to blackne&s;s; it has a weaker &s;mell and ta&s;te than the former; after this they make a third, by brui&s;ing their heads and ex|pre&s;&s;ing their juice; but this la&s;t is reckoned but of little value.</P>
<P>After they have collected the opium, they moi&s;ten it with a &s;mall quantity of water, or of honey, and work it a long time upon a
<PB N="359" REF="026198_0367_0FCF578502932248">
flat, hard &s;mooth board, with a thick and &s;trong in&s;trument of the &s;ame wood, till it becomes of the con&s;i&s;tence of pitch: Finally, they work it up with their hands, and form it into cakes, or rolls, for &s;ale.</P>
<P>Opium being now &s;o generally u&s;ed in medicine, mu&s;t cau&s;e a great demand for it: Of cour&s;e it mu&s;t fetch a good price, there|fore it will be an object worthy the agricultu|ri&s;t's attention.</P>
<P>The poppy is propagated from the &s;eed; one hundred heads will produce &s;eed enough to &s;ow an acre; the cultivation of it is exced|ingly ea&s;y, as it will grow in almo&s;t any &s;oil or climate; and I am of opinion if the heads were collected together when they are full of juice, (ju&s;t before they come into flower) and the juice pre&s;&s;ed out and managed as before de&s;cribed, that the opium would be as good as that collected from the inci&s;ions, as it would contain the &s;ame virtues.</P>
<P>This method will &s;ave a great deal of trou|ble and expence.</P>
<P>Prepared opium or laudanum, is a tinc|ture of opium made by di&s;&s;olving the opium
<PB N="360" REF="026198_0368_0FCF579F4AA12D18">
in &s;pirits of wine, &s;ome other &s;pirits, or water having different ingedients added to it, ac|cording to the u&s;e it is intended for.</P>
