<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is one of the Heavenly Counsels of Aged <HI>Paul</HI> to Young <HI>Timothy,</HI> which reacheth to all Ministers and Christians in all Ages.</P>
<P>[1 Tim. 4. 7.] <HI>Exercise thy self unto Godliness.</HI> Now that is done by a frequent practice of those Duties, which have a Tendency to the promoting of the Power of <HI>Godliness,</HI> in our selves and o|thers; and which through the Blessing of God, will not fail to attain that End: amongst which there are none more useful than <HI>Meditation, self-Examinations</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Prayer:</HI> These are not on|ly Enjoyned by the <HI>Word,</HI> but Confirmed by the <HI>Experience</HI> of all the Saints, bearing witness to this great Truth, that there is no maintaining the Life and Power of <HI>Godliness</HI> without a diligent practice and frequent Exercise of the fore-named Holy Duties; and therefore any Contribution of help towards any of these, and in particular that of <HI>Meditation,</HI> deserveth a thankful acceptance from all the People of God.</P>
<P>The Object of <HI>Meditation [God revealing him|self in his Work and Works</HI>] is of a large Extent; the particularizing of some of the <HI>Works</HI> of God in <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Providence,</HI> considered
<PB REF="000656_0006_0FA9A3C676CFC4D0">
with the adjunct of <HI>Time</HI> wherein they do Exist, and Expressing what the Word says of those <HI>Works</HI> in their <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Seasons,</HI> is of singular use to fix the Volatile and Voluble Mind of Man un|to profitable <HI>Meditations</HI> with Application to our|selves: as a Godly Man once said, <HI>Shew me any Creature, and I will sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w thee God.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Works</HI> of God in their general Nature, and special kinds, and the proper Subject of Na|tural Philosophy; for <HI>for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Ars bene Naturan|di; Natura est res nata <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">: Principium est Materiale &amp; Formale; i. e.</HI> the Material and For|mal Causes do constitute the Nature, and make up the <HI>Essence</HI> of every Creature of God in it self considered: but the same Creatures &amp; Works considered in relation to the Supream Efficient and Final Cause, as they are from <HI>God</HI> as their <HI>First Cause,</HI> and for <HI>God&punc;</HI> as their <HI>Lust End,</HI> so they belong to <HI>Theology,</HI> and so the Holy Scripture doth abundantly treat of them, shewing Gods Ef|ficiency running through, and influencing all <HI>S</HI>e|cond and Subordinate Causes, and entring into every Essect: and then the same Efficiency pre|serving the Being and Power of Working in all the Creatures, &amp; directing all their Motions thorough all &amp; above all their next Inferior <HI>Ends,</HI> to God him|self as the last End of all; Hence every Creature hath its Existence and Operations, as it is <HI>Ens a primo ad Primum;</HI> and thus the Holy Scriptures do every where proclaim God as the <HI>First</HI> and the <HI>Last, Isa.</HI> 44. 1. <HI>Rev.</HI> 1. in relation to all the Creatures; for <HI>of him, and through him, and to him
<PB REF="000656_0007_0FA9A3C733FE2288">
are all things, unto whom be Glory for ever,</HI> Amen. Rom. 11. 36.</P>
<P>It is further observable, the Scripture doth not only treat of the Works of God themselves, but of the Circumstance of <HI>Time;</HI> not meerly as <HI>Time</HI> is <HI>Fluxus Nunc,</HI> or <HI>duratio rerum,</HI> but as its under a Divine Predetermination of the <HI>Seasons</HI> of Time wherein every Creature doth Exist, and every Event shall come to pass; and therefore it informs us, Acts 17. 26. That, <HI>God hath determined the Times appointed before,</HI> and that, Eccles. 3. 1. <HI>To e|very thing there is a Season, and a time to every pur|pose under Heaven;</HI> and the Psalmist speaking to God, says, Psal. 74. 16,17. <HI>Thou hast made the Summer and the Winter, the Day is thine and the night also is thine:</HI> and <HI>Moses</HI> the Man of God tells us that <HI>Seed time, and Harvest, Summer and Winter, and Day and Night shall not cease,</HI> until the end of the World, <HI>Gen.</HI> 8. <HI>last.</HI> In all which Expressions we are to understand, the Works of God that are done, and the Events of Providence that come to pass in the <HI>Appointed Times and Seasons of the Year;</HI> as now, In the <HI>Winter-time,</HI> Job 37. 6,7. <HI>God seals up the hand of every man, that all men may know his Work.</HI> In the <HI>Spring</HI> time he <HI>Renews the Face of the Earth,</HI> Psal. 104. 30. and revives all the Creatures. In the <HI>Summer</HI> time he <HI>Cloaths</HI> the Earth in its best Array, and gives the <HI>Fruitful Sea|sons; Mat.</HI> 6. 30. Acts 14. 17. and then in the <HI>Au|tumn</HI> he <HI>Crowns</HI> the Year <HI>with his Goodness,</HI> Psal. 65. 11. and brings in the <HI>Joy of the Harvest,</HI> Isa. 9. 3. Nay the Psalmist further informs us, that
<PB REF="000656_0008_0FA9A3C7F04573D0">
<HI>Day unto Day uttereth Speech, and Night unto Night sheweth Knowledge,</HI> Psal. 19. 2. implying the various passages of Providence in every day and night of all the Seasons of the Year, are such as give Instru|ction to us in the Knowledg of that God who Made all, and Rules all, and will Judge us all at the Last Day, when all the Works of Creation &amp; Providence shall come to an end, &amp; when <HI>Time</HI> (that was Concreated with them) <HI>shall be no more:</HI> then God himself shall be <HI>all in all,</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 28. World without End.</P>
<P>Now in all the forementioned respects, this pre|sent pious and ingenious Treatise doth recommend it self to every Intelligent Reader, as a singular &amp; seasonable help to Improve the time of the Win|ter Season in such an Exercise of <HI>Godliness,</HI> as di|recteth us how to observe the <HI>Works</HI> of God there|in, &amp; to acknowledge God in them, &amp; by compa|ring the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> of God together to have suitable (either sett or occasional) <HI>Meditations</HI> on the Wisdom &amp; Power, the Greatness &amp; Goodness of God, and this with Application to our selves, and our own Duties, so as to raise our hearts and affections to the Fear and Love &amp; Service of that God, who is God <HI>over all blessed for evermore.</HI> Up|on which Ground I cannot forbear wishing that the Reverend <HI>Author</HI> of this, would do the like in relation to the other three Seasons of the Year; being assured that the Holy Scriptures are as rich in furnishing Materials for Spiritual Meditations on the W<HI>orks of God</HI> proper to the <HI>Spring,</HI> the <HI>Summer</HI> and the <HI>Autumn,</HI> as well as to the <HI>Winter|time.</HI></P>

<HI>A</HI>nd truly, I cannot but give thanks to God, and Congratulate our <HI>New-England,</HI> that He hath Raised up such a Learned, Pious, and Ingenuous Person amongst the Ministers of our Third Gene|ration, and hath poured out his Spirit upon him, and hath Enabled him not only to an Exemplary Diligence in the Work of the Ministry both pub|lickly and privately amongst his <HI>Own People</HI> with great Success; but also to Write so many Useful <HI>Treatises</HI> on several Subjects, relating to the great Concernments of the Souls of all men, and of the State of Religion amongst us at this day; which I doubt not but they have been, are and will be acceptable and profitable to the good people of this Generation, and those that shall succeed.</P>
<P>Finally, my hearts desire and Prayer to God is; that he would graciously preserve the Life and Health of this his Laborious and Faithful Servant, and give him to be <HI>Strong in the Grace that is in Christ Jesus,</HI> and Enable him to Write many more such Useful Treatises as he hath done alrea|dy, for the Glory of God and good of the Souls of men, and that the Blessing of Heaven may go along with this present Work, and make it Effectual to attain the good Ends thereof.</P>

<HEAD>THE Introduction</HEAD>
<P>IT is the Description, which <HI>Martinius</HI> in that Noble and <HI>L</HI>earned piece of <HI>Geography,</HI> which he calls <HI>Atlas Chinensis,</HI> gives con|cerning the Air in that part of the Eastern World, <HI>Majus in hac Provincia Frigus est, quam illius poscat Polt Altitudo:</HI> Says he, <HI>The Cold in</HI> China, <HI>is greater than the Elevation of the</HI> Pole <HI>there would seem to allow: for the Country lies in little more than Forty Degrees of</HI> Latitude, <HI>and yet for four Months together in the Year, the Ri|vers there are so Frozen, that the</HI> Ice <HI>will bear the passage not only of Men, but of Horses and Coaches too, upon it. Yea, and the Ships are so shut up in their Harbours, that unto the beginning of</HI> March, <HI>there is hardly any stirring out; and there is more</HI> Froze <HI>in one day than there can be</HI> Thaw'd <HI>in many.</HI> I almost Thought that I read the Description of our <HI>Winters</HI> in this part of our Western World, in those words of the Geo|grapher: for tho' the <HI>Latitude</HI> of the princi|pal Town in this Province be but <HI>Forty Two Degrees, Twenty Seven Minutes,</HI> yet our Cold is by many Degrees more Fierce and Hard, how|ever more clear, pleasant and wholsome than

that of many places that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y beyond <HI>Fifty:</HI> and when it shall be told unto Strangers, that we have had <HI>Frosts</HI> both in <HI>June</HI> and in <HI>August,</HI> they will also conclude, That our <HI>Winters</HI> must needs be as <HI>Long,</HI> as they are <HI>Cold.</HI> Now, the pinches of such a <HI>New-English B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nter,</HI> Awakened me to Consider, How so <HI>Cold</HI> and so <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> a Time of Diversion from very much of our other Business, might be best Employ'd for the Glory of that God, who <HI>Made both the Summer and the Winter?</HI> As, 'Twas the manner of an Ingenious Person, when in the Morning there was a prospect of a <HI>Fair Day,</HI> to say, <HI>'Tis pitty such a Fair Day should be Lost:</HI> so, The most of our <HI>Winter</HI> Days are <HI>Fair</HI> ones: not such Dirty, Slappy, Lowring Things, as fill the <HI>Winters,</HI> in some other Lands; and methoughts, 'Twas <HI>pitty</HI> any of them should be <HI>Lost,</HI> as too many of them are. I am sufficiently dissatisfyed at the ordinary Definition, which the Schools have given of the <HI>Cold, A Quality that Congregates Things both a like, and an unlike Nature.</HI> Yet I have been far more dissatisfy'd, at the too usual way of spending our <HI>Dayes,</HI> when the <HI>Cold</HI> almost con|sines us from our Christian <HI>Congregations.</HI> But, what seem'd the best way of Redeeming these <HI>Dayes?</HI> Truly, I was willing to T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y, not only whether there could not be found many pious <HI>Works</HI> to be attended with a singular convenience in the <HI>Winter,</HI> but also, whether the Accidents of the <HI>Winter</HI> it self, might not afford something to Assist us, and Quicken us, in those <HI>Works.</HI> There are certain <HI>Plants,</HI> which keep <HI>Green,</HI> all the <HI>Win|ter

Long;</HI> and thought I, why should not I endea|vour that the Exercises of Devotion, might so do, both in my self and others, who desire to be, <HI>As Green Olive-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rees in the House of our God?</HI> The <HI>Winter</HI> has been sometimes called, <HI>Hyems Iners,</HI> the <HI>Sluggish</HI> Winter; but, I would contribute what I can, that it may be, <HI>Hyems Sancta,</HI> the <HI>Pious</HI> Winter, the <HI>Holy</HI> Winter, the <HI>Useful</HI> Winter; a <HI>Winter</HI> devoted unto the <HI>Works</HI> of the God of Heaven. To <HI>Sleep</HI> all <HI>Winter,</HI> more befits a <HI>Bear,</HI> than a <HI>Man,</HI> and much more than a <HI>Saint.</HI> It is very certain, That there is more <HI>Time</HI> contained in a <HI>Natural Day</HI> of the <HI>Winter,</HI> than there is in a <HI>Natural Day</HI> of the <HI>Summer:</HI> for, the Sun in its Annual Motion from the West unto the East, thro' the <HI>Zodiac,</HI> passes equal Arches in unequal Times: the <HI>Winter</HI> Half Year of the Suns passing from <HI>Libra</HI> to <HI>Aries</HI> is but an Hundred and Seven|ty Eight Days, whereas the <HI>Summer</HI> Half Year of his passing from <HI>Aries</HI> to <HI>Libra,</HI> is no less than Hundred and Eighty Seven Days: the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Nine Days more in passing through the Semi-E|cliptick of the <HI>Summer,</HI> than he is thro' that of the <HI>Winter;</HI> and accordingly an Hour upon the <HI>Sun-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> when the Sun is inclining to the <HI>Winter|Tropick,</HI> is longer than an Hour upon the Dial, when he is advancing near the <HI>Summer Tropick.</HI> Hereupon, I could not but make that Reflection, <HI>If there be more, tho' it scarce be sensibly more, Time in a Day now, than at other Times in the Year, why should I do less work for God, for Christ, for His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> now, than at other Times?</HI> and as an effect of
<PB REF="000656_0013_0FA9A3CBB46D0158">
that Reflection, Behold, Reader, some of my WINTER-MEDITATIONS.</P>
<P>'Tis, as I remember, <HI>Polydore Virgil</HI> who relates, that when <HI>Math<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">dis</HI> was, during the Depth of Winter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, in <HI>Oxford,</HI> She arrayed her self and her followers all in white, the colour of the <HI>Snow</HI> upon the Ground, and by the Ad|vantage of that Colour escaped thro' the Besie|gers unto a place of Safety. That which I desire, is, a free passage for the <HI>Truths,</HI> and the <HI>Ways,</HI> and the <HI>Works</HI> of God, into the minds of my Neighbours; and I have therefore taken the Ad|vantage of putting a <HI>Winter Complexion</HI> upon them; I have Clothed them in the Colours of the <HI>Winter.</HI> And in this ESSAY, I have after a sort Moralized the Fable of <HI>Antiphanes,</HI> That there is in a certain <HI>Scythian</HI> Region such a <HI>Frost,</HI> that the <HI>Words</HI> uttered in the <HI>Winter</HI> there Con|gele so as to be not heard until the <HI>Summer</HI> fol|lowing shall dissolve them: for 'twas at <HI>Boston-Lecture,</HI> in the Month of <HI>December</HI> last, that the Heads of these <HI>Winter-Meditations,</HI> were first <HI>Preached;</HI> and it is now in the Month of <HI>November</HI> following that they are <HI>Printed,</HI> on the same De|signs of <HI>Religion,</HI> that gave them their Original.</P>
<P>When the Excellent <HI>Barthelinus,</HI> published his Book, <HI>De Usu Nivis,</HI> it was accompany'd with an Epigram, something to this purpose,
<Q><L><HI>Libros Authoris, quieun&abque; recenset et Annos,</HI></L>

'Tis possible, that now I am Composing my Book about, <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Winter,</HI> I may find my self obliged to confess unto the World, as a Great <HI>Fault,</HI> what was indeed counted <HI>None</HI> at all in that incomparable Person! I <HI>do</HI> confess, That I have written too many <HI>Book<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> for one of my small Attainments; and I would say to my Reader, whom I now suppose by the <HI>Fire side,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this of any <HI>Book</HI> of mine, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> man from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them|selves with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that <HI>Book</HI> of God.

'Tis true, There is a Froward Generation in every place, whose <HI>Ca|lumnies</HI> must Persecute all that Serve the Publick; and I have had the Experience of both my <HI>Fathers</HI> as well as my own, to convince me, that this place has of those <HI>Froward</HI>s in it.

<P>THat most Laborious and most Imi|table Minister of the Gospel, the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> after he had been Travelling on the Designs of the Gospel all the <HI>Summer</HI> long, had some affairs of the Gospel to ma|nage in the <HI>Winter</HI> too. Speaking about a City of <HI>Thrace,</HI> he said, in Tit. 3. 12. <HI>I have determined there to winter:</HI> and accordingly in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the Apostles, we find this famous <HI>Doctor of the Gentiles</HI> once abode three <HI>months in Greece,</HI> after he had <HI>gi|ven much Exhortation</HI> to the People as he went a|long.

Christ, and of His Gospel, was not in the <HI>Three Months of the Winter,</HI> to be laid aside.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Us,</HI> we are now getting into our <HI>Win|ter-Quarters,</HI> and we ought not only to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> our Cares about <HI>Religion, &amp; Salvation</HI> and all the Works of&punc; the <HI>Gospel,</HI> all the <HI>Winter</HI> long; but there are some singular Lessons of the Gospel to be in these W<HI>inter Months</HI> inculcated and entertai|ned. Indeed, there is not <HI>One-Day</HI> in the Year, whereon we should not be, <HI>In the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear of the Lord all the Day long;</HI> but there are diverse <HI>Months</HI> in the Year, wherein the <HI>Fear of God</HI> is to single out some special wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s of Exercise:</P>
<P>That there are Special Duties of Christianity, belonging to the <HI>winter,</HI> is intimated, in the words now Read unto us; and it is also intimated, <HI>what</HI> those Christian Duties are. Tis Pitty that the <HI>winter</HI> should advance any further upon us, before we have had some discourse of these <HI>D</HI>uties: To be minding one another of these things, would be more Significant, and more Profitable, than our impertinent expence of time, in telling one another <HI>That it is very Cold.</HI></P>
<P>Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that your Devotions here in this <HI>winter-season,</HI> put you upon some Trial of your <HI>P</HI>atience. But I have an occasion here to tell you; <HI>You have heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Patience of</HI> JOB. <HI>He</HI> was a Person of Quality, who dwelt in <HI>Arabia the Desart,</HI> and yet that <HI>Arabia</HI> could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut be <HI>the Happy</HI> while it enjoyed the Presence of such a Ruler.

from great Wealth and Health into Miseries that have made a <HI>Proverb,</HI> all Ages have since heard, with wonderment. In these his Miseries, he was visited by some of his <HI>Comfortable Neighbours,</HI> who yet proved but <HI>Miserable Comforters.</HI> Among these Visitants there were <HI>Three</HI> more Aged <HI>Men of God,</HI> which Venerable Saints, all took their Turns, in dealing with him, about his Condition before the Lord; but at length it came to the Turn of a <HI>Fourth,</HI> who tho' he were a Younger Person, yet stood something longer than the rest in the Dis|putation.</P>
<P>This <HI>Elihu,</HI> for <HI>That</HI> was his Name, is in our Context&punc; proving, That as there is a most Inscru|table and Unblemished <HI>Wisdom,</HI> in all the Works of God, so in the Afflictions which the Lord had now sent upon <HI>Job,</HI> there was nothing to be at all complained of. Whatever is done by our Great God, either <HI>in</HI> the Great World, or <HI>to</HI> the Little World, we have cause to say, <HI>He hath done ALL Things</HI> W<HI>ELL:</HI> and there is no Work of God, whereof, all Circumstances considered, we have not cause to own, <HI>His Work is perfect.</HI> No|thing in the World could be more <HI>Arrogant</HI> than the Speech uttered by the King of <HI>Arrag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, That be could have contrived a better shaped World;</HI> nor more worthy to be Rebuked with such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">urning Thunderbolts as the <HI>Spanish</HI> Annals tell us, brought that haughty Monarch unto Repentance.

to be seen, have a Remark most particularly here set upon them.</P>
<P>In our Text, First, We have some <HI>Accidents</HI> of the <HI>Winter. He saith to the Snow, Be thou on the Earth; Likewise to the Small Rain, and is the Great Rain of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is Strength.</HI> In the <HI>Winter,</HI> we have plenty of <HI>Snow</HI> and <HI>Rain;</HI> and those No|table Productions of the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reus Kingdom,</HI> as they come from the <HI>Word,</HI> so they shew forth the <HI>Strength</HI> of our God. Not only such <HI>Snows</HI> as those that fall upon <HI>Caucasus,</HI> whereof such is the Quantity, that <HI>Strabo</HI> tells us, whole Re|giments of Men have perished, therein over|whelmed: but the ordinary <HI>Snows</HI> of every <HI>Winter;</HI> Not only such <HI>Rains</HI> as these that fall near <HI>Mexico,</HI> whereof <HI>Johnston</HI> reports, that sometimes the <HI>Drops</HI> are so big and fierce as to kill the very people with their fury; but the ordinary <HI>Rains</HI> of every <HI>Winter;</HI> these have much of God, appearing in them. And one thing therein done by our God, is this:</P>
<P>[<HI>He seals up the Hand of every man</HI>] That is, By h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d Weather he binds up their Hands, from doing any Work abroad. But indeed, there are more than those who work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with their <HI>Hands,</HI> that feel these Obstructions of the <HI>Winter.</HI> Wherefore the French Version, so carrys it, <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s fait que chacun se Renferme;</HI> that is, <HI>Then he makes every man shut himself up;</HI> and it is very Expressive.</P>
<P>There is an Impious Interpretation that some have made of these words; as if being, <HI>In ma|nu

Omnium Hominum signa posuit,</HI> they countenan|ced, <HI>Chir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mancy;</HI> a foolish and absurd Science, which pretends from the <HI>Lines</HI> in our <HI>Hands,</HI> to read the <HI>Fates</HI> of our <HI>Lives.</HI> As for that curious Vanity, I shall say but thus much of it; The <HI>Lines</HI> in our Hands, are mostly formed, by the Accidental <HI>Uses</HI> and <HI>Motions</HI> of our Hands; and may accordingly, by the like means be altered. <HI>Opinions</HI> about our future Circumstances and Con|tingencies, cannot be drawn to any purpose from these Lines, unless they be done meerly by <HI>Im|pulse;</HI> and the <HI>Impulse,</HI> which has often darted many true <HI>Predictions</HI> into the Minds of Ungodly <HI>Fortune tellers,</HI> when they have been poring on the <HI>Hands</HI> of others, is ordinarily from some of the <HI>Demons,</HI> who are <HI>at Hand</HI> always to Encourage such Impieties; and of the <HI>Predictions</HI> which the <HI>Demons</HI> have thus perhaps Litt upon, but as proba|ble <HI>Conjectures,</HI> they immediately Employ all their Interest, which in <HI>This world</HI> is very great, for the Accomplishment. Of the Divine Vengeance, leaving such wretched <HI>Fortune tellers</HI> unto the more than ordinary power of the <HI>Devil,</HI> we have in our own Land, lately seen most horrid Instances. A|way then, with all such <HI>Diabolical Communions!</HI> Let us with a Christian Resignation, wait upon God, in a willing and a wholsome Igno|rance of, <HI>The Secret Things which belong unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But then, Secondly, we have some <HI>Employments</HI> for the <HI>Winter.</HI> Men are <HI>Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">d,</HI> from their work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hen the W<HI>inter</HI> comes. But what? Have they

<HI>no work</HI> then to mind? Yes; <HI>All men</HI> are then to <HI>know his work.</HI> To <HI>Know</HI> that work, is, according to the Import and Fulness of the Hebrew Phrase to <HI>Learn</HI> the work, to <HI>Love</HI> the work, to <HI>Do</HI> the Work.

<P>Well; There is an Important CASE, where|with I would hence take occasion to give you some WINTER-ENTERTAINMENTS. It is The CASE.</P>
<P><HI>What Special</HI> Works <HI>for the Glory of God, may and should be Attended by the Children of Men, when by the hard weather of the</HI> Winter, <HI>He shuts them up, or Hinders them from their Ordinary Busi|nesses?</HI></P>
<P>They are not only <HI>Commoda,</HI> or Profitable Things, but also <HI>Accommoda,</HI> or Seasonable Things which are to be Preached among you. Our W<HI>in|ter</HI> is our <HI>Liesure,</HI> and as it will be a <HI>Profitable,</HI> so 'tis but a <HI>Seasonable</HI> Undertaking, to Lay before you, <HI>How the Liesure of the</HI> W<HI>inter may be most Im|proved for the Glory of God.</HI></P>
<P>Now, without any further Preface, First, that we may speak more <HI>Negatively,</HI> it is to be assert|ed, That the <HI>Liesure</HI> of the W<HI>inter</HI> must not be <HI>Abused,</HI> as if it were a <HI>Liesure to work Abominations,</HI> or as if it were a <HI>Liesure</HI> for any Superstitious or Prohibited <HI>Sensualities.</HI> 'Tis not in the Slothful and

Frothy Diversions of B<HI>ad</HI> C<HI>ompany,</HI> nor in things which will <HI>wrong our Souls,</HI> that our W<HI>inter</HI> is to be Sweeled away.

<P>There was one W<HI>inter Month</HI> in the Year which was call'd <HI>Mensis Genialis,</HI> or the Frolick some and Voluptuous <HI>Month,</HI> among the Ancient Pagans; it was the Month of DECEMBER wherein the Heathen had their <HI>Saturnalian</HI> Jolli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ies.

None of them will observe the Lords-Day, Lest they should be Christians; and shall not we then, by observing their Festivalls, fear lest we be made Ethnicks!</HI> Nor will I enter into any dis|pute, Whether the Birth of Our Lord were in <HI>De|cember;</HI> tho' they that are versed in Antiquity, do understand how divided the Ancients were about it; and how late, yea, how many Hundreds of Years, it was e're the <HI>December Festival</HI> could obtain: and how much more probability there is, that it rather fell out, about the time of the <HI>Feast of Ta|bernacles,</HI> about the conclusion of <HI>September,</HI> or the beginning of <HI>October.</HI> But I will venture to say thus much, That it is well if the World be mend|ed, since the famous and pious <HI>Bishop</HI> made his Complaint <HI>That men dishonour the Lord Jesus Christ more in the Twelve Days of</HI> CHRISTMAS, <HI>than in all the Twelve Months of the Year beside.</HI> And I will venture to say this more, That when the <HI>Corinthians</HI> pray'd the Apostle, to answer that Question, <HI>Whether they might so be with, as to do like, the</HI> P<HI>agans in those Idolatrous Festivities:</HI> He plainly told them, <HI>No!</HI> Deterring of them, with the Example of <HI>Israel</HI> in the Wilderness, who would keep a <HI>Feast</HI> in Honour of the true God, but yet follow'd the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who in Comme|moration of <HI>Joseph,</HI> saving them from Death by Expounding a Dream of <HI>Kine,</HI> had a sort of <HI>Ox-Worship</HI> among them: It is said, <HI>The</HI> P<HI>eople sat down to Eat and Drink, and Rose up to play;</HI> and all the World has heard, what the <HI>Reckening</HI> was!</P>

of <HI>Eating</HI> and of <HI>Drinking,</HI> do deserve a Caution, why should not the <HI>Mispence</HI> of the Winter in GAMING, do so too? Especially the Games of <HI>pure Lot,</HI> whereof thus much at least may be men|tained, <HI>That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t is best for all Christians to abstain from them.</HI> Altho' moderate Recreations in the <HI>Winter,</HI> are more than a little H<HI>ealthful</HI> and <HI>Use|ful,</HI> yet there are some Recreations too much used in the <HI>Winter,</HI> which in Truth are never conveni|ent; such are the Games of CARDS, &amp; DICE, and those which have nothing but CHANCE to manage them. A <HI>Lot</HI> is a solemn Appeal unto the God of Heaven; and hence to <HI>play</HI> with it, seems to break the Third Commandment in the Laws of our God. <HI>Lus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ry Lots</HI> are by Great and Grave Divines Esteemed Unlawful, on the same Score that, as our worthy <HI>Morton,</HI> in his Rebuke to the <HI>Gaming Humour</HI> well Expresses it, <HI>It would be an Abomination unto any Christian, to see a</HI> Pulpit, <HI>a</HI> Communion-Table, <HI>a</HI> Font, <HI>Exposed on a Stage, or the Gestures of Worship Aped by</HI> Players.

When the Roman Empire became <HI>Christian,</HI> severe Edicts were made against these <HI>Games;</HI> and what <HI>Christians</HI> are we then that

practise them. Our Protestant Reformers have branded these Games with an Infamous Character; yea, <HI>Tully</HI> the Orator himself, could produce it, as a Reproach unto some Ill men, that they were given to these Games. For which cause He that will follow, <HI>Whatsoever Things are of Good Report,</HI> will not meddle with such Infamous Things as these. In every <HI>Indenture</HI> for an Apprentice these words are usual, <HI>At Cards, Dice, or any other Un|lawful and Prohibited Games, he shall not Play.</HI> And shall we that are by <HI>Covenant,</HI> the Bound Servants of the Lord Jesus Christ, offer to Play at <HI>Games,</HI> that have been so Stigmatized?

<P>And if men may Sin by Some <HI>sorts of Gaming</HI> in the <HI>Winter,</HI> mayn't they do it in some kinds of READING too? Not only Books of Debauch|ing <HI>Jests</HI> and <HI>Songs,</HI> are very unworthy to be

our WINTER-ENTERTAINMENTS, but the most of <HI>Romances</HI> too will then but create a <HI>Wast of Time,</HI> to be Repented of. And here also, that I may not Impose my own Opinion, I shall give you the Judgment of two Writers, whom the World have not accounted Inconsiderable. The One is, The Author of, <HI>The whole Duty of Man;</HI> who Dehorting of Young Women from the Rea|ding of <HI>Romances,</HI> has these words, <HI>'Tis very dif|ficult to Imagine what vast mischief is done to the World by the false Notions and Images of things, par|ticularly of Love and Honour, those Nobler Concerns of Humane Life, represented in those Mirrours.</HI> The other is, the Incomparable Dr. <HI>Tuch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ey;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> likewise disswading of young Students from the Reading of <HI>Romances,</HI> has these words, <HI>Make this Trial, whether when you have been Greedy in Reading such Books, you have thereby any great mind to Read the Bible. I am sure that when you have been Read|ing That, you will have as little Delight is Reading them, as</HI> Paul <HI>had in the Thorn in his Flesh, when he had been before caught up to</HI> P<HI>aradise.</HI></P>
<P>All that I shall add, is, That when the Rules of <HI>Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Godliness</HI> are Trans|gressed, Men instead of <HI>Knowing</HI> the W<HI>orks</HI> of God, are <HI>Doing</HI> the <HI>Works</HI> of Gods Great Enemy; And I am sure, The <HI>Winter</HI> is not a <HI>Liesure,</HI> for such Odious <HI>Works.</HI></P>
<P>But then, <HI>Secondly;</HI> we may speak more POSI|TIVELY; and it is to be now affirmed, That the <HI>Liesure</HI> of the <HI>Winter</HI> is to be Employ'd, in such Things, as may be called, A WISE RE|DEEMING

<P N="2">II. The Great God requires our <HI>Contemplation</HI> to observe ALL HIS WORKS, and the <HI>Liesure</HI> of the <HI>Winter</HI> should very much go to that <HI>Contemplation.</HI> We should now <HI>Know the Work of God,</HI> and Study as far as we can, every one of <HI>His Works.</HI> There has been that Invitation unto us, in Psal. 46. 8. <HI>Come, Behold the Works of the Lord, what Desolasions He hath made in the Earth.</HI> Truly, there are in every <HI>Winter,</HI> many <HI>Desolations</HI> made upon the product of the <HI>Earth;</HI> but we should then B<HI>ehold All,</HI> as well as <HI>Those works of God.</HI> We

<P>First, There is an Humble Acknowledgment of God, wherewith we are to <HI>behold</HI> his works of CREATION, and the <HI>winter</HI> may be our liesure for it. The Psalmist having mentioned the <HI>Eve|ning,</HI> when men lay by their labour, he presently adds, in <HI>Psal</HI> 104. 24. <HI>O Lord how manifold are thy Works! in wisdom hast Then made them all.</HI> As if <HI>then</HI> were a liesure for such a meditation! Truly thus in the <HI>winter,</HI> when we throw up our other Labour; we should then, <HI>Behold these manifold works of God.</HI> We should not in the <HI>winter</HI> become such Recluses as to forget that we are, <HI>The Citizens of the world;</HI> but then take a Range about the <HI>works</HI> of our God in the World.

It is a most Glorious Varie|ty of Objects, which we have to <HI>behold</HI> on this lit|tle <HI>Terraqueous Globe,</HI> We are at present <HI>sojourners.</HI>

<P>Secondly. There is a profound <HI>Adoration</HI> of God, wherewith we are to <HI>Behold</HI> His Works of REDEMPTION; and for this likewise we have the <HI>Liesure</HI> of the <HI>Winter.</HI> When our Lord was undergoing some of His Last <HI>Agonies,</HI> for the <HI>Re|demption</HI> of Lost Man, 'tis said in Joh. 19. 18. <HI>They made a Fire of Coals, for it was Cold, and they warmed themselves.</HI> Accordingly, when we have a <HI>cold Winter</HI> upon us, Let us <HI>Warm</HI> our Souls, by thinking on what our Lord Endured in the latter end of the <HI>Winter</HI> for us. When we are in our <HI>Warm Houses,</HI> O Behold, that <HI>Hot Love</HI> of our Lord unto our Souls, which tho' He Lay in a <HI>Winter night</HI> groveling on the <HI>cold</HI> Ground, yet made Him <HI>Sweat,</HI> yea, to Sweat Clotters or Globules of <HI>Blood,</HI> more terrible to Behold, than those <HI>Bloody Sweats,</HI> which <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> tells us, besel the people of the East, when their <HI>Serpents</HI> had bitten them. When we are in our <HI>Warm Garments,</HI> O then Behold the <HI>Heat</HI> of our Lords <HI>Love,</HI> wherein He Hung <HI>Naked</HI> on the Cross, in the <HI>Cold Air,</HI> for Six Hours together of a <HI>Winter-Day.</HI> The Unfathomable Mysteries of <HI>Redemption</HI> are the <HI>Raptures</HI> of the <HI>Angels,</HI> all the Year about; it is said of those <HI>Cherubims</HI> conver|sant about the <HI>Mercy-Seat,</HI> in 1 pet. 1. 12. <HI>These Things they Desire to Look into.</HI> Let us make the same Things our Study, especially in that part of

the Year, the <HI>Winter,</HI> when we have most of Liesure for the Study. We find in Eccl. 11. 7. <HI>Truly the Light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the Eyes to behold the Sun.</HI> Tho in our Winter we have less <HI>Light</HI> than at other Times, yet we may then have more Time to <HI>Behold the Sun of Righte|ousness;</HI> and How <HI>pleasant</HI> a Task should we E|steem it! Let us now take a Time to Behold the Matchless <HI>Glories</HI> of our Lord Redeemer; and hear that Call of God, <HI>Behold, the Lamb of God!</HI> There is a bright Constellation of <HI>Miracles</HI> that Unite in our Blessed Mediator, and glitter won|derfully; Let us now, Behold those Miracles of <HI>God manifest in the Flesh,</HI> and of that <HI>Child Born to us, that Son given to us,</HI> who is the <HI>Everlasting Fa|ther,</HI> that <HI>Man</HI> who is the <HI>Mighty God,</HI> and whose Name is therefore <HI>Wonderful.</HI> But now also let us take a Time to Behold the Glorious <HI>Methods</HI> of our Salvation by this Lord Redeemer. Behold the most admirable Contrivance of our Salvation, in the <HI>New-Covenant!</HI> It is <HI>wonderful,</HI> that God should <HI>so Love the World as to give His only Begotten Son, that whosoever Believeth in Him should not perish, but have Everlasting Life.</HI> It is <HI>wonderful,</HI> that the <HI>Only Begotten Son of God should ever take on Him the Form of a Servant, that we might become the Children of God.</HI> It is <HI>wonderful,</HI> that <HI>He who knew no Sin, should be made Sin for us, that we might be made the the Righteousness of God in Him.</HI> The Wayes of the Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> in <HI>Applying</HI> the <HI>Redemption</HI> thus obtained for us, are yet further WONDERFUL. The MYSTICAL BODY of our Lord Jesus

Christ, with regard unto the manner and effect, of our being brought into an <HI>Union</HI> with Him we are told, <HI>It is fearfully and wonderfully made.</HI> Well, we should now, Behold these <HI>Winders,</HI> and continue to do so, till we have no more <HI>Winter,</HI> yea, till we have no more <HI>Spirit</HI> Left.</P>
<P>Thirdly, There is an Hearty Admiration of God, wherewith we are to <HI>behold</HI> this works of PROVIDENCE; and for this also we have the <HI>Liesure</HI> of the <HI>winter.</HI> It is noted concerning the <HI>Wheels of Providence,</HI> in Ezek. 10. 12. <HI>The wheels were full of Eyes.</HI> When the <HI>winter comes about,</HI> in the <HI>wheel</HI> on the year, we should have our <HI>eyes open,</HI> and be <HI>full of eyes,</HI> to behold the motion of those wondrous <HI>wheels.</HI> The Governed of the World is maintained in the <HI>winter,</HI> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as all the rest of the year about; but we have in the Winter, more of Liesure, to behold the Spotless and Exact Administration of that <HI>Government.</HI> We behold ma|ny storms in the Winter; but it is then also a time to behold the <HI>Power</HI> and; <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, in managing all the <HI>Storms</HI> wherewithal the world is Ruffled, and causing them all to be sub|servient unto his own Designs and Interests. It is said in Psal. 107.43. <HI>Who so is wise, and will ob|serve these things, even they shall understand the Loving kindness of the Lord.</HI> There are Illustrious Dispen|sations, wherein the Almighty God acts as a <HI>Re|warder</HI> unto the children of men; and we shall be <HI>very well Rewarded</HI> for all the Confinements of the <HI>Winter,</HI> if we take our Liesure now to ac|quaint
<PB N="24" REF="000656_0039_0FA9A3DFF23633C8">
our selves with such Dispensations: Our <HI>Confinement</HI> will become our <HI>Liberty!</HI> There are the Dispensations, of the Most High towards His <HI>People;</HI> His Protecting them, His Directing them, His Increasing them. When the Church of God, was Represented unto <HI>Moses,</HI> as a <HI>Burning Bush,</HI> it is said, <HI>He drew near to Behold the Sight.</HI> And when we are by our <HI>Fire-side</HI> in the Winter, we may have Liberty to Behold that <HI>Burning Bush.</HI> There are also the Dispensations of the Most High, towards His <HI>Enemies;</HI> His Confounding of them, His Destroying of them. The Winter was hardly out, when <HI>Israel Beheld the Great Work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians:</HI> And we may <HI>then</HI> also Behold, how terribly <HI>Egyptians</HI> are punished by the Hand of God. When our Lord had been Talking with His Disciples, about those performances of <HI>Providence,</HI> wherein the Scriptures had Received their Accomplishment, they could say, in Luk. 24.32. <HI>Did not our Hearts then Burn within us?</HI> Why, when we are e'en ready to <HI>Freeze</HI> with the Vapours of the Winter, the Dis|ciples of our Lord should then be Talking toge|ther, about His Doings in the World; The <HI>News</HI> of Great Occurrents are then to be Enquired af|ter, not as by <HI>Athenians,</HI> having only an Itch of Novelty to prompt those Enquiries, but as by <HI>Dis|ciples</HI> inquisitive after the <HI>Fulfilments of the Scriptures.</HI> and after the Illustrations of the Divine <HI>Attributes,</HI> in those <HI>Fulfilments.</HI> Thus are we to Talk till our <HI>Hearts Burn</HI> within us. And hence also, <HI>Church-History</HI> is a very suitable Study for the <HI>Winter;</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="000656_0040_0FA9A3E0B18D8818">
<HI>Martyrologies,</HI> and the Lives of Eminent Per|sons, and the Stories of Eminent <HI>Reformations,</HI> Difficulties, and Deliverances attending the Church of God, are now very fitly Studied.</P>
<P>Finally. As it was said, in Job 37. 14. <HI>Stand still, and Consider the Wondrous works of God:</HI> When the <HI>Winter</HI> comes, we can't <HI>Go out</HI> as at other times; Well, since we must <HI>Sit still,</HI> now let us more than ever, <HI>Consider the Wondrous Works of God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. In the very CONSTITUTION OF THE WINTER it self. There are very sensible <HI>Works</HI> of God, and our God requires <HI>us</HI> to be very sensible of those Notable <HI>Works.</HI> Almighty God now <HI>Seals</HI> up our <HI>Hands,</HI> that we may <HI>Know His Work.</HI> What <HI>Work?</HI> Why, that very <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Sealing</HI> up our <HI>Hands;</HI> and that <HI>Work</HI> of sending <HI>Snow,</HI> and <HI>Rain,</HI> and <HI>Winter</HI> upon the <HI>Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Well then, when the <HI>Winter</HI> comes, we must Acknowledge that it is from <HI>God.</HI> It is as we read, Psal. 147.17. <HI>Gods Cold,</HI> and for that cause we may not call it <HI>Cruel Cold;</HI> at least it must be a cruel <HI>Catechresis,</HI> by which we call it so? nothing done by God, should be Esteemed <HI>Cruel.</HI> Even so, 'tis <HI>Gods Winter,</HI> the Almighty God is to be Reverenced as the Orderer of it all.</P>
<P>Is the <HI>Winter</HI> now Rolled about? Then <HI>Know,</HI> That God is the MAKER of the <HI>Winter.</HI> 'Tis Enqulred, in Job. 38.28,29. <HI>Hath the Rain a Father? Out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> came the Ice? and the
<PB N="26" REF="000656_0041_0FA9A3E170FBF290">
Hoary Frost of Heaven, who hath Gendred it?</HI> So, when the <HI>Winter</HI> is upon us, we may Enquire, whence <HI>comes this Cold,</HI> and <HI>snow, and Rain, and all the rest?</HI> But we see them all fall from <HI>Heaven;</HI> &amp; unto the God of Heaven should we ascribe the making of all. As the Winter is of Gods <HI>Promise;</HI> Whe|ther the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> World had any proper <HI>win|ter</HI> or no, yet the Lord presently after the Flood, engaged concerning our present World, <HI>Summer &amp; Winter shall not cease:</HI> Thus, the <HI>Winter</HI> is of Gods <HI>Making</HI> too. The Numberless Number of <HI>Saline Particles,</HI> from whence at least some circumstances of the <HI>Winter</HI> do arise, do all of them say, <HI>Tis the Lord that has made us, and not we ourselves.</HI> There seems to be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> store of <HI>Corpuscles</HI> a little akin to <HI>Nitre,</HI> exhaled from the Terrestrial Globe, and ro|ving about in sundry parts of the <HI>Atmosphere</HI> (of the Figure which <HI>Philoponus</HI> tells us, <HI>Democritus</HI> as|sign'd unto Frigorific Atoms) and these may not a little contribute unto many things that we feel in our cold. But still, who made them all? And thus, not only those mighty Rands of <HI>Ice</HI> (that <HI>Magnum Duramen Aquarum,</HI> as <HI>Lucretius</HI> Calleth it,) Encountred by such, Navigators as <HI>Janus Munckius,</HI> who saw these Icy-Islands floating Twenty Fathom above Water; or as <HI>Baffin,</HI> who round some above Water, between two &amp; three Hundred foot High; or those that sometimes occur in the River of <HI>Ca|nada,</HI> where Icy-Islands have been seen, computed Fourscore Leagues in Length; but every little Ice-Cycle is the Workmanship of God.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="000656_0042_0FA9A3E2334C04E0">
Again, <HI>Know,</HI> That God is the SENDER of the <HI>Winter.</HI> 'Tis affirmed, in Job 37.9.10. <HI>Cold comes out of the North; by the Breath of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rest is given, and the Breadth of the Waters is straitned.</HI> When a <HI>Northern Winter</HI> is nipping of us, 'tis from an Edict of God, giving order for such a Season. It is <HI>God that sends Rain</HI> (and the Rest) <HI>upon the Earth.</HI> The <HI>Winterish Winds</HI> blow our <HI>Winter</HI> about our Ears; yea, but it is the <HI>Breath</HI> of God, that is the <HI>First Mover</HI> of all. There is much Dispute, what is the <HI>Primum Frigidum;</HI> whe|ther <HI>Air,</HI> or <HI>Water,</HI> or <HI>Earth,</HI> or <HI>Nitre,</HI> or what? And some will Dispute whether there be any such <HI>Thing</HI> at all, or no. For if the <HI>Coldness</HI> of any thing signifie no more, than its not having its Insensible Parts agitated so much as those of our <HI>Sensories</HI> by which we judge of <HI>Tactile Quali|ties;</HI> then to make a thing become <HI>cold,</HI> there needs no more than that the Sun or Fire, or some other Agent, that more vehemently Agitated its parts before, do now cease to do it. But he Cold a <HI>positive</HI> Quality, (which I encline to think) or a <HI>privative,</HI> still 'tis the Breath of God that gives Rise unto it. What the <HI>Centurion</HI> said about the Servants under His Command, <HI>I say to one, Come, and he comes;</HI> thus the <HI>Winter;</HI> 'tis our Great So|veraign who says to it, <HI>Come;</HI> and so the <HI>Winter comes.</HI></P>
<P>Once more, <HI>Knew,</HI> That God is the RULER of the <HI>Winter.</HI> This is intimated in Psal. 74.17. <HI>Thou hast set all the Borders of the Earth, thou hast made Summer and Winter.</HI> So, It is God, Who sets
<PB N="28" REF="000656_0043_0FA9A3E2F0A994A0">
<HI>Borders</HI> to the <HI>Winter</HI> upon the <HI>Earth.</HI> It is <HI>God</HI> who says to the <HI>Winter, Keep off till such a Month.</HI> It is <HI>God,</HI> who says to the <HI>Winter, Go off at such a Month.</HI> The <HI>Unlimitable Holy One of Israel,</HI> is He that <HI>Limits our Winter</HI> for us.

<P>Let me add, The Obedience of the <HI>winter</HI> un|to our God, should be considered by us, to shame our <HI>Disobedience.</HI> If God say to the <HI>Snow,</HI> and the <HI>Rain,</HI> and the Like, <HI>Be thou upon the Earth,</HI> straightway they are so. What Wretches then are we, that when this God shall say to us, <HI>Be thou upon thy Knees, or, Let thy Heart be in Heaven,</HI> we slight what He faith!

<P>We may be Thankful, that the <HI>Winter</HI> it self is not so <HI>Hard,</HI> either as it might be, if God should make it so, or as it is now in some other Lands, yea, or as it has been heretofore among our selves. The Psalmist saw cause to say, in Psal.147.17. Who <HI>can stand before His Cold?</HI> If God should carry on the <HI>Cold</HI> unto a little further Ex|tremity upon us, there could be no <HI>Standing</HI> be+fore it. Or, if the <HI>Cold</HI> which in its Extremity carries usually but <HI>Three Days</HI> among us, were Extended for <HI>Three Months,</HI> instead of any <HI>Stand|ing,</HI> there could be no <HI>Living</HI> for us.

It is not <HI>pleasing</HI> to God, that we should be really C<HI>ruel</HI> to our selves. <HI>Gods Com|mands</HI> do not commonly oblige us to overthrow the Health of our <HI>own Bodies.</HI> We cannot be <HI>Righteous</HI> at all, except we <HI>Deny</HI> our selves; but when we come to <HI>Destroy</HI> our selves, by Excesses in the <HI>Manner of Doing,</HI> what must be <HI>Done,</HI> tho

<P>This I am sure of; that all our <HI>Accommodations</HI> all the <HI>winter</HI> long, will be very much the <HI>Sweeter,</HI> if not also the <HI>Surer,</HI> unto us, for our having first Liberally Imparted a S<HI>hare</HI> unto out Honest Neigh|bours, that were altogether Destitute of such <HI>Ac|commodations.</HI> We read, <HI>in a certain place,</HI> concer|ning, <HI>The Treasures of Snow.</HI> One of the Ancients does expound those <HI>Treasures</HI> to be, <HI>Worldly Riches</HI> which the next Shower of Calamity will wash a|way, like a <HI>Snow-Drift,</HI> and leave only some <HI>dirt,</HI> behind in the owners heart.

<P>It would be a sad thing, if we should in the <HI>winter</HI> be driven out of our Habitations. Our Lord has allow'd us to deprecate very heartily, <HI>A flight from our Houses in the winter:</HI> and for the same cause, <HI>A fire on our houses in the winter,</HI> deserves as warm a Deprecation.

Turn this, O <HI>my</HI> S<HI>oul,</HI> into an useful Meditation. There is a Necessity of my Rising out of my <HI>Bed,</HI> the Bed of S<HI>ecurity,</HI> which I am under the pow|er of; and to <HI>Live</HI> unto Christ, and <HI>walk in the Light.</HI> In order hereunto, I must <HI>put on</HI> my Soul, the <HI>Garments,</HI> which are to be had from the Lord Jesus.

I am also taught, That when men are C<HI>onvinced</HI> of their miserable Condition, they will rather Endeavour to Ease and Comfort and Cherish themselves, by something in <HI>Themselves,</HI> than put on the S<HI>piritu|al Garments,</HI> which the Lord Jesus Christ has pro|vided for them.
