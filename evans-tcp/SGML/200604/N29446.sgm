<P>_WHereas the Holy God, who out of his tender mercy and bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion hath pre&s;erved this People, and the&s;e Churches from the Malice and Rage of their Enemies, and of tho&s;e that devi|&s;ed Mi&s;chief again&s;t them, and thereby be&s;poken his own prai&s;e in that to this day we remain a People, that out of his very Faithfulne&s;s, doth con|tinue to afflict us, as with the remainder of the Heathen, yet in Ho&s;tility with us, &s;o al&s;o with that &s;ore Di&s;temper of the <HI>Small Pox</HI> (daily increa&s;ing in our prin|cipal Towns, and &s;everely threatning us in this winter &s;ea&s;on) and thereby late|ly bereaving us of that mo&s;t eminently Learned, Pious and Faithful Servant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t Mr. <HI>Thomas Shepard</HI> Pa&s;tor to the Church of Chri&s;t in <HI>Charl&s;town</HI>; the continuance of our Me&s;&s;engers in <HI>England,</HI> and their Negotiation therein; and the di&s;&s;ettlement of the <HI>Colledge</HI> contrary to our hopes and expectation: one al&s;o cau&s;e of our &s;erious application to God, be&s;ides the con&s;ideration of that little advantage the body of the Lords People in this Wilderne&s;s have obtained by the late pa&s;&s;ed Woes and Mi&s;eries he hath brought upon us; thereby fru&s;trate|ing his declared intention of &s;uch Affliction, <HI>viz.</HI> to Humble us, and Prove us, and do us good in the latter end: The joint con&s;ideration of the&s;e things have moved the COUNCIL to &s;et apart the one and twentieth of <HI>February</HI> next, to be kept as a day of &s;olemn Humiliation and Prayer unto God, and invocation of his Holy Name, if po&s;&s;ible we may meet him in the way of his Judgement, and obtain reconciliation with him; the &s;ettlement of our remaining troubles at home, right under&s;tanding and favour with the Kings Maje&s;ty, and the turning of our hearts unto God, and to each other, that the Lord may yet vouch&s;afe his pre&s;ence with us:</P>
<P><HI>And do therefore Inhibit all Servile Labour on that Day, and commend it to all Churches, Ministers and People throughout this Juri&s;diction, &s;olemnly and &s;eriou&s;ly to keep the &s;ame accordingly.</HI></P>
