<P>I <HI>Beseech You, Bretheren, by the Mercies of God,</HI> that you now give your Serious Attention, unto the <HI>Returns</HI> which you are to make for those <HI>Mercies,</HI> declared in</P>
<BIBL>ROM. XII. 1.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>I beseech you therefore, Brethren, by the Mercies of God, that yee present your Bodies, a Living Sa|crifice, Holy, Acceptable unto God: Your Rea|sonable Service.</HI></Q>
<P>As <HI>Reasonable</HI> a Thing certainly, as ever was proposed, in the World!</P>
<P><HI>Christians,</HI> I have set before you, a pas|sage of Sacred Scripture, worthy to be <HI>Written,</HI> as once the whole <HI>New Testament</HI> where|of this is a part, was upon the Walls of a Ger|man Monastery, <HI>In Letters of Gold;</HI> Yea, to be <HI>Written</HI> on the <HI>Fleshly Tables</HI> of our <HI>Hearts</HI> for ever.</P>
<P>We find this passage, in an Epistle Directed unto the <HI>Apostolical</HI> Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and an Epistle, which insisting on that Great Article of <HI>Justification</HI> only by Faith in the Obedience of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is the main Thing
<PB N="4" REF="000752_0004_0FAA51B36CD4CE80">
denyed by the present Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> and on the Conversion of the <HI>Israelitish Nation,</HI> which is to be <HI>Consequent</HI> on, and perhaps a little <HI>Effect|ed</HI> by, the Destruction to come shortly on the present Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> in those, as well as in other Notable Things, it mentions matters, wherein the <HI>Apostatical</HI> Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> is in a peculiar manner concerned.</P>
<P>But <HI>we</HI> also are concerned in these Things; and <HI>this Day,</HI> Eminently concerned in the Text now to be considered.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrinal</HI> part of this Epistle, being dis|patched in the first Eleven Chapters, the <HI>Practical,</HI> is comprized in the Five last; And this part, begins with a most Universal, &amp; most Com|prehensive <HI>Exhortation.</HI> Wherein we may note,</P>
<P>First, The <HI>Matter</HI> of the Advice. This is, That we do make our <HI>Bodies,</HI> which by a <HI>Sy|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">doche,</HI> implies our whole <HI>Selves,</HI> our <HI>Souls,</HI> our <HI>Names,</HI> our <HI>Friends,</HI> our <HI>Estates,</HI> and all our In|terests, a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> unto God: which is done, in short, by Devoting them unto the Service of that God.</P>
<P>Next, The <HI>Manner</HI> of pressing it. This is, with, A Compellation, <HI>Brethren:</HI> An Obtestation, <HI>I beseech you;</HI> And a very weighty Argument, <HI>By the Mercies of God;</HI> that is to say, The <HI>Mercies</HI> of God lay upon us, a very powerful Ob|ligation hereun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o.</P>
<P>But we have not yet given the Text so par|ticular an <HI>Illustra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">,</HI> as it seems to call for
<PB N="5" REF="000752_0005_0FAA51B429D6B950">
Know then, That according to the Stricter No|tion of a <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> its more general Distinction, is into <HI>Propitiatory,</HI> or <HI>Eucharistical</HI> Now Christi|anity in that Notion admits but <HI>One,</HI> and this of the <HI>former sort;</HI> by which <HI>One,</HI> even <HI>that of Himself,</HI> our Lord <HI>hath forever perfected them that are Sanctified:</HI> He is a <HI>Poor Priest,</HI> who dreams of any other. We our selves, or any Things that we do, in <HI>Religion,</HI> are capable of being <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> only by way of <HI>Analogy,</HI> &amp; that chiefly to the latter sort; <HI>So,</HI> we <HI>offer up Spiri|tual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</HI> A <HI>Sacrifice</HI> here signifies no more, than a <HI>Thing Devoted unto God.</HI> But what are we thus to <HI>Devote?</HI> Our <HI>Bodies.</HI> Hereby we are to un|derstand our <HI>whole Selves:</HI> but it is Expressed by, <HI>Your Bodies,</HI> for Distinction sake: the <HI>Bodies</HI> of <HI>Beasts</HI> were heretofore Offered, and now we are to Offer up <HI>Our own.</HI> This is called, a <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Sacrifice,</HI> because the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of old was to be brought <HI>Alive</HI> unto the Lord; the <HI>Isra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> might not themselves <HI>Eat</HI> a thing <HI>Dead</HI> of it self, much less might they bring such a Thing to the <HI>Living God.</HI> And yet the Victim was to be <HI>Slain,</HI> in <HI>Sacrificing;</HI> which is here opposed, by an Intimation, that when we <HI>Sacrifice</HI> our <HI>Bodies</HI> to the Lord, they yet continue to <HI>Live</HI> Our <HI>Lives</HI> will not be at all <HI>Impaired,</HI> by the commanded <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of our Bodies, no, they will be <HI>Improved</HI> by a wonderful <HI>Sac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">dness</HI> added thereunto. Our <HI>Bodies</HI> are to be an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Sacrifice:</HI> And yet the <HI>Bodily Life</HI> also is herein

but alluded unto: 'tis a further, an Higher, a Nobler <HI>Living,</HI> a <HI>Living</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, that is here called for. <HI>Holy,</HI> is annex|ed without any Tautology; for though it be in our word, <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> it is not in the Greek word, <GAP DESC="foreign">. And besides, the Real <HI>Holiness</HI> or the Rectitude of Mind, and Walk, which attends our <HI>Sacrificing</HI> of our selves unto God, is here pointed at. What is <HI>Holiness</HI> but a <HI>Devotion</HI> of our selves unto the Lord Jesus Christ? This will be <HI>Acceptable.</HI> Indeed our <HI>Sacrifice</HI> becomes not <HI>Acceptable By</HI> this; and yet, it is <HI>not</HI> Acceptable <HI>without</HI> it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> We have been told, that all our Sacrifices, are <HI>Acceptable to God, by</HI> Jesus <HI>Christ.</HI> How|ever, <HI>Holiness,</HI> in the Nature of the Thing it self, is <HI>Well pleasing</HI> unto God. And, In all this there is a <HI>Reasonable Service;</HI> This intimates the <HI>Transcendency</HI> of the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> required; they are not <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uits</HI> but <HI>Men,</HI> that are to be a <HI>Sacrifice;</HI> and the Highest <HI>Acts of Reason</HI> too, are to be the Ingredients of the <HI>Sacrifice;</HI> and the <HI>Right</HI> of God hereunto is also signified; there is no|thing so <HI>Reasonable,</HI> as that we should Offer our selves unto Him. 'Tis to be done with a <HI>Presentation;</HI> we are to set our selves before God, as they did <HI>Sistere ad Altare,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> destined <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> making them <HI>Stand</HI> ready there for Immolation. The Result of all is,</P>
<P><HI>That the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of God unto us, Very Strongly obligeth us to</HI> Devote <HI>our selves unto the</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>of God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000752_0007_0FAA51B5D442B0F8">
There are Two <HI>Prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">sitions</HI> which we are here to Listen unto.</P>
<P N="1">1. The First and Great <HI>Obedience,</HI> and the Summ and Substance of that <HI>Obedience,</HI> which we owe unto God, is the <HI>Devotion</HI> of our selves unto the Service of the Lord Jesus Christ. That we should <HI>Serve</HI> the God that made us, <HI>This</HI> is the Grand <HI>End</HI> for which we are made by God: Of mankind, it is by the Eternal Ma|ker said, <HI>This people have I formed for my self, they shall show forth my praise.</HI> But it is the <HI>Son</HI> of God, who is that <HI>Word</HI> of God, of whom we are told, in Col. 1. 16. <HI>All things were Cre|ated by Him, and for Him.</HI> And the <HI>Son</HI> of God, who is also the <HI>Son</HI> of Man, <HI>He</HI> is that, <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> of God, and that <HI>Lord</HI> of All concerning whom 'tis the <HI>Will</HI> of God, expressed, in Joh: 5 23. <HI>That all men should Honour the Son, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they Honour the Father.</HI> The <HI>Dues</HI> which belong to God from us, the Lord <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> our <HI>Immanuel,</HI> and our <HI>God manifest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Flesh,</HI> is the more immediate Receiver of them. <HI>He</HI> hath a <HI>Right</HI> unto us not only as He hath <HI>Made</HI> us, but as He hath <HI>Bought</HI> us too; &amp; as we are directed, in Eph. 5. 20. <HI>To give thanks unto God, and the Father, in the Name of our Lord</HI> Jesus Christ; thus, our <HI>Service</HI> is then most agre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ably and effectually yielded unto <HI>God,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we distinctly put the <HI>Name</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST upon all, as being a <HI>Service</HI>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ded for <HI>Him</HI> immediately. All the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God
<PB N="8" REF="000752_0008_0FAA51B68E76E568">
unto us, comes thro' the Hand of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, the <HI>God man,</HI> and the Medi|ator between <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man.</HI> Hence, tho' it were an Impiety, to Exclude the Consideration of God the <HI>Father,</HI> or of God the <HI>Spirit,</HI> in that <HI>Service</HI> which we are to render unto God for His <HI>Mercy,</HI> yet we then render it after the most <HI>Christian manner,</HI> when we carry the Lord JESUS CHRIST in our Thoughts, as the next Object of it. Wherefore, in the Meditations which I am to give you, I shall study still to insert the <HI>Name</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as calling for that <HI>Service,</HI> which is to be done in the whole of our <HI>Obedience</HI> unto God. And this I do the rather, because of a boiling An|tipathy in my Soul, against the <HI>Paganism</HI> of those Traitors unto the King of Heaven, who tho' they call themselves <HI>Divines,</HI> yet would have their Sermons and Writings valued, for the same cause that Blessed <HI>Austin</HI> undervalued the Books of their Brother <HI>Cicero, Quia Nom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Christi non est i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i;</HI> the <HI>Name</HI> of the Lord JE|SUS CHRIST is not there. Nor indeed, would we be so profane, as to reckon it a <HI>Battology,</HI> or a <HI>Superfluity,</HI> in the <HI>Fourteen E|pistles of Paul,</HI> that this dearest Name occurrs four <HI>hundred and fifty Times</HI> therein, and no less than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Times</HI> in the <HI>Ten First Verses</HI> to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI></P>
<P>The Thing which I assert is, That the <HI>Obe|dience</HI> to God, which His Innumerable &amp; Unparallellable
<PB N="9" REF="000752_0009_0FAA51B72B67B990">
<HI>Mercies</HI> unto us, do call for, is, That we <HI>Devote</HI> our selves unto the <HI>Service</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST; who <HI>to this End both Died and Rose, that He might be the LORD of all.</HI> To <HI>Serve</HI> the Lord JESUS CHRIST, what is that? Briefly, 'Tis to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> of His Infinite <HI>Excellencies,</HI> and bring others to join with us in making of such <HI>Acknowledgments.</HI> It is to bear our <HI>Testi|monies</HI> unto the <HI>Truths</HI> and unto the <HI>Wayes</HI> of he Lord JESUS CHRIST, and Conform our selves unto His <HI>Will.</HI> Now to <HI>Devote</HI> our selves hereunto, is our <HI>Acceptable Sacrifice;</HI> For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e are assured, <HI>He that Serveth Christ, is Ac|ceptable to God.</HI> And we are thus to proceed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n our doing of it.</P>
<P>First, We are to be convinced and satisfied of this; That the <HI>Service</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is the most <HI>Reasonable Service.</HI> The lord JESUS CHRIST, is the <HI>True God,</HI> the <HI>Great God,</HI> the <HI>Mighty God,</HI> and <HI>GOD over all, Blessed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r ever.</HI> The Lord JESUS CHRIST, is He, whom all the <HI>Angels</HI> adore, as the <HI>Lord of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">osts,</HI> the Creator and Preserver of the World; and the most High, <HI>Possessor of Heaven and Earth.</HI> The Lord JESUS CHRIST is He, to whom we are beholden for all the <HI>Good</HI> Things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat ever we do enjoy. HE particularly, tho' He were <HI>Equal with God,</HI> nevertheless <HI>Took on Him the Form of a Servant,</HI> for our Good. Upon the view of all this, we are to pro|nounce
<PB N="10" REF="000752_0010_0FAA51B92DDFAED0">
it infinitely <HI>Reasonable,</HI> that we should for ever be the <HI>Devoted Servants</HI> of such a Lord. But the Benefits of <HI>Redemption</HI> which we have by our Lord JESUS CHRIST, are to have a very particular consideration, among the <HI>Reasons</HI> of our <HI>Serving</HI> Him. If we Serve Him not, we <HI>Deny the Lord that Bought un.</HI></P>
<P>We are hereupon to <HI>Dislike,</HI> and <HI>Renounce</HI> every <HI>Service</HI> inconsistent with that of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. The proposals which those Hellish <HI>Taskmasters,</HI> the FLESH, the WORLD and the DEVIL, make unto us, we should Reject with all possible Abhorrence; and be al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ogether impatient of the <HI>Drudgeries,</HI> which we undergo, while we are under their Di|rection.</P>
<P>We are herewithal to <HI>Resolve</HI> that the <HI>Ser|vice</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, shall with His Assistences, be our Everlasting Employ|ment. It is not a <HI>Cold Assent,</HI> but a <HI>Full purpos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Heart,</HI> with which we are to <HI>Cleave unto the Lord.</HI> And with a Resolution to undergo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>Self denial</HI> therein called for, we must be able to say, <HI>Lord, I have inclined my Heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> perform thy Statutes alwayes, even unto the End.</HI></P>
<P>We are herein to give the full consent of our Souls unto the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> wherein <HI>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bonds</HI> to the <HI>Service</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST are to be Signed by us. In the <HI>Co|venant of Grace,</HI> it is demanded of us, whether we are willing that the Lord JESUS CHRIST
<PB N="11" REF="000752_0011_0FAA51BA791D79A8">
should Enstate us in the <HI>Favour</HI> of God, by the vertue of His <HI>Obedience</HI> and <HI>Intercession,</HI> and by His Gracious Influences Enable us, as persons <HI>United</HI> unto Himself, to <HI>Glorify</HI> God for ever, and by His own Divine Methods, both <HI>Instruct</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and <HI>Incline</HI> us, to come at that Final Blessed|ness? And whether we are willing to Express our <HI>Thankfulness</HI> unto Him, for Delivering us from Spiritual and Eternal Miseries, by sincere Endeavours to <HI>Serve</HI> Him in <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Righ|teousness</HI> all our Dayes? We are now to give up our selves unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, by declaring our most Hearty <HI>Consent</HI> unto this <HI>COVENANT,</HI> in all the Terms of it. Our <HI>Baptismal Vow</HI> is thus to be Renewed, by our Professing in the most early years of our <HI>Youth</HI> and <HI>Choice,</HI> That we do for ever approve of the <HI>Dedication</HI> to the <HI>Service</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, which was visibly passed up|on us in our Infancy.</P>
<P>And finally, We are now to Study, how to Improve our <HI>All,</HI> for the <HI>Service</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST; that He may have Reve|nues of Glory out of <HI>All.</HI> Having said with <HI>Joshua, I will Serve the Lord,</HI> we are to say unto our Lord JESUS CHRIST, as one once more improperly did unto another King, <HI>I am thine, my Lord, O King, and all that I have.</HI> It was required, in 1 Cor. 6. 20. <HI>Glorify God in your Bodies, and in your Spirits, which are His.</HI> Yea, It was required, in 1 Cor. 10. 30 <HI>Whether ye
