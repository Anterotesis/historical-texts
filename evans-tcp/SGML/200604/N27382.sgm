<P>SEC. I. BE <HI>it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Con|gress assembled,</HI> That the following rules and regula|tions be adopted and put in force, for the government of the navy of the United States.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 1. The commanders of all ships and vessels belonging to the United States, are strictly re|quired to shew in themselves a good example, of ho|nor and virtue to their officers and men, and to be ve|ry vigilant in inspecting the behaviour of all such as are under them, and to discountenance and suppress, all dissolute, immoral, and disorderly practices, and also such as are contrary to the rules of discipline and obedience, and to correct those who are guilty of the same, according to the usage of the sea service.</P>
<P N="2">2. The commanders of the ships of the United States, having on board chaplains, are to take care, that di|vine service be performed twice a day, and a sermon preached on Sundays, unless bad weather, or other ex|traordinary accidents prevent.</P>
<P N="3">3. Any person who shall be guilty of profane swear|ing, or of drunkenness, if a seaman or marine, shall be
<PB N="4" REF="036496_0003_1009E619992A46A8">
put in irons until sober, and then slogged if the cap|tain shall think proper&mdash;but if an officer, he shall for|feit two days pay, or incur such punishment as a court martial shall impose, and as the nature and de|gree of the offence shall deserve.</P>
<P N="4">4. No commander, for any one offence, shall inflict any punishment upon a seaman or marine beyond twelve lashes upon his bare back with a cat of nine tails, and no other cat shall be made use of on board any ship of war, or other vessel belonging to the United States&mdash;if the fault shall deserve a greater punishment, he is to apply to the Secretary of the Navy, the com|mander in chief of the navy, or the commander of a squadron, in order to the trying of him by a court martial; and in the mean time he may put him under confinement.</P>
<P N="5">5. The commander is never by his own authority to discharge a commission or warrant officer, nor to pu|nish or strike him, but he may suspend or confine him, and when he comes in the way of the Secretary of the Navy, the commander in chief of the navy, or the commander of a squadron, may apply for holding a court martial.</P>
<P N="6">6. The officer who commands by accident in the captain or commander's absence (unless he be absent for a time by leave) shall not order any correction but confinement, and upon the captain's return on board, he shall then give an account of his reasons for so do|ing.</P>
<P N="7">7. The captain is to cause the articles of war to be hung up in some public place of the ship, and read to the ship's company once a month.</P>
<P N="8">8. Whenever a captain shall enter or inlist a seaman, he shall take care to enter on his books, the time and terms of his entering, in order to his being justly paid.</P>
<P N="9">9. The captain shall, before he sails, make return to the Secretary of the Navy, a complete list of all his officers and men, with the time and terms of their en|tering, and during his cruise or station, shall keep a
<PB N="5" REF="036496_0004_1009E61B3326E110">
true account of the desertion or death of any of them, and of the entering of others, and after the expiration of the time for which they were entered, and before any of them are paid off, he shall make return of a complete list of the same, including those who shall remain on board his ship.</P>
<P N="10">10. The men shall, at their request, be furnished with slops that are necessary, by order of the captain, and the amount delivered to each man, shall be regu|larly returned by the purser, so that the same be stopt out of his pay.</P>
<P N="11">11. All officers not having commissions or warrants, (or appointed commission or warrant officers for the time being) are termed petty, or inferior officers.</P>
<P N="12">12. Whenever any inferior officer, seaman, or other person, be turned over into the ship of a commander other than the one with whom he entered, he is not to be rated on the ship's books, in a worse quality, or lower degree or station, than he served in the ship he was removed from; and for the guide of the captain, he is to demand from the commander of the ship from which such person or persons were turned over, a list, under his hand, of his or their names, and the quali|ty in which he or they served.</P>
<P N="13">13. Any officer, seaman or others, entitled to wages or prize money, may have the same paid to his assignee, provided the assignment be attested by the captain and the purser; but the captain or commander of every vessel in the service of the United States, is to discou|rage his crew from selling any part of their wages or prize money, and never to attest the letter of attor|ney until he is satisfied that the same is not granted in consideration of money given for the purchase of wages, or shares of prize money.</P>
<P N="14">14. When any officer or other person dies, the cap|tain is forthwith to have his name entered on the books of the ship, in order to the wages being forth|with paid to his executors or administrators.</P>

<P N="17">17. It is left to the discretion of commanders of squa|drons, to shorten the allowance of provisions accor|ding to the exigence of the service, taking care that the men be punctually paid for the same&mdash;the like power is given to captains of ships acting singly, where it is deemed necessary, and if there should be a want of pork, the captain is to order three pounds of beef to be issued in lieu of two pounds of pork.</P>
<P N="18">18. If any ships of the United States shall happen to come into port in want of provisions, the warrant of the commander of the squadron, or a captain where there is no commander of a squadron present, shall be sufficient to procure the supply of the quanti|ty wanted, from the agent, or navy agent at such port.</P>
<P N="19">19. The captains are frequently to cause to be ins|pected the condition of the provision, and if the bread proves damp, to have it aired upon the quar|ter deck, and other convenient places, and in case of the pickle being leaked out of the flesh casks, he is to have new pickle made and put therein, after such casks are repaired.</P>
