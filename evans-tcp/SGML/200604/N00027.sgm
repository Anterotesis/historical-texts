<P>WHen that grand-Heretick <HI>Swenck setld,</HI> who in eighteen yeares had published fifty scripts, (such as they were) sometime troubled <HI>Luther.</HI> with his papers, which he sent unto him for an answer: his returne was quick, saying to the messenger, the Deuil was the author of them: the Lord rebuke thee O Satan! <HI>Quod-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ult-deus</HI> whilest he desired <HI>Au|gustine</HI> to publish a tract of al the heresies which infested the church in those dayes, discerned the undertaking to be too immense &amp; great: this <HI>Calvin</HI> also perceiving being about to write against the Libertines, presently determined omitting the rest of their wild &amp; endlesse heterodoxies) to addresse himselfe unto the enumerati|on, &amp; refutation, of some of their principall, &amp; portentous tenets. <HI>Luthers</HI> answer may seems too short: <HI>Augustines</HI> taske is acknow|ledged too long, <HI>Calvins</HI> example in this brief treatise I shall in part (God assisting) endeavour to follow.</P>

<P>The distinction of the <HI>persons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> subsistences,</HI> is manifest from the relative properties of <HI>begetting,</HI> being <HI>begotten, and proceeding,</HI> Psal. 2. 7.

<P>A personal act is God necessarily, relatively and in an Incommuni|cable manner, acting within or upon himselfe.

<P>The distinction of the Persons further appeares, from the <HI>order,</HI> of their operations upon the creature; held forth in their mission, or sending, the second Person is sent from the Father Iohn. 8. 42. <HI>Iesus said unto them, if God were your father, yee would love mee, for I proceeded forth &amp; came from God: neither came I of my selfe, but he sent, mee.</HI> The Holy-Ghost is sent from the Father &amp; the Son: <HI>whom the Father will send John.</HI> 14. 26. <HI>whom I will send John.</HI> 15. 26.

Secondly, a designation of the Person distinguished by this relative property unto some work concerning the creature to be perform|ed in time.

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is true, that the times here spoken of, are the times <HI>after those dayes Jer:</HI> 3. 33. <HI>Heb</HI> 8. 11. <ABBR><HI>viz:</HI></ABBR> the times, after the dayes of the <HI>Mosaical administration,</HI> of the Covenant of Grace: which expired fully, at the Passion of Christ, so, that the times here spoken of, are the times of the Gospel-dispensation of the Cove|nant of Grace: beginning at the abrogation of the <HI>Mosaical-dis|pensation,</HI> and continuing, untill time shall be no more.</P>
<P>But what more disconsonant from, or what more contradict|ory to Scripture, then to teach, that throughout all the time of the Gospel-dispensation, there is no need of the ministry of man? wee appeal to the examples of the <HI>Apistles, Evangelists, Ordinary Office-labourers</HI> in the word &amp; doctrine, and Gospel-churches recorded in sacred writt; as also to the institution of the Gospel-ministry, by <HI>Pastors and Teachers,</HI> for the calling of the Elect a|mongst all Nations, <HI>for the perfecting of the saints, untill we come unto a perfect man;</HI> i.e. untill the perfection, of the Mystical body of Christ.</P>

with the elect <HI>Israel,</HI> in the time of the Gospel. As also, the second covenant (other respect of its preheminence omitted, not so nextly pertinent to the present discussion) preferred before the first, upon the account of the betterness of the discriminating promise.</P>
<P><HI>They</HI> i. e. the national Israel <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eake the covenant although</HI> God <HI>was an husband unto them.</HI> But as concerning the elect Israel under the better covenant <HI>I will put my la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in their inward parts and write it in their hearts, I will be their</HI> God <HI>and they shall be my people, saith the LORD.</HI> which is in effect the same with <HI>Isay</HI> 54 13&punc; <HI>Iohn</HI> 6. 45. <HI>And they shall be all taught of GOD&punc;</HI> i.e. They shall not be onely taught of man, as others in externall covenant onely are. These words [T <HI> hey shall be all taught of GOD</HI>] are not to be interpreted <HI>exclusively so as to exclude the teaching of man:</HI> but <HI>exten|sively,</HI> so <HI>as to include the teaching also of God:</HI> witness the cloud of Scripture-instances of all those under the Gospel-dispensation, who were taught of God: but how? by not without the teaching of man. Further the promise undertakes for such a writing of the Law in their hearts such a teaching of God, as that they shall not finally apostate from the Covenant: Jer: 32. 40. <HI>But I will put my Fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</HI></P>
<P>The Subject spoken of, are such persons, which are actually the people of God, such in whose hearts the Law is written. <HI>The knowledg of God,</HI> is taken either for that knowledg of him, which is essential to effectual vocation, or for the knowledg of edifica|tion. Taking knowledg in the former notion, of <HI>writing the Law in the heart</HI> indelebly: this being a property of the Covenant of grace, the sense naturally flowes; <ABBR><HI>viz:</HI></ABBR> that after coversion once wrought, there shall be no need, to speak unto such, to know the Lord: namely with a knowledg essential to vocation, as if they were ignorant thereof, for this were in effect to deny, a characte|ristical priviledg of the Covenant, and to affirm falling from grace Regeneration is not iterable, they who are once converted, need not to be converted from the state of nature to the state of grace a second time. This seemeth to be the genuine sense of the place.</P>
<P>If we take knowledg in the latter notion, <ABBR><HI>viz:</HI></ABBR> for <HI>the know|ledg of edification;</HI> then the interpretation proceeds comparatively, thus: comparing the <HI>Gospel-Israel,</HI> having the law written in their hearts, being also under a clearer dispensation, &amp; under the promise of an efficacious, &amp; copious influence of the Spirit: with the

<P>The <HI>day dawning,</HI> and <HI>the day-starr appearing:</HI> denotes either the saving light of the Spirit, making our attention unto the Scrip|ture from time to time effectual, during the season of our depen|dance hereupon, throughout this life: or that day-light of the vision of glory: both which senses in conclusion issue in one. But, it cannot be understood of the regenerating-light of the Spirit; because the Apostle speakes to those who are believers, still to at|tend upon the Scripture.</P>
<P>The patticle [<HI>untill</HI>] (any other acception not pertinent to the matter under consideration omitted) either noteth a certain time, before which such a thing is to be, which was not before: or after which such a thing is not to be, which was before. <HI>The Scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a Law-giver from between his feet, untill Shiloh come.</HI> Gen: 49. 10. But here it denoteth not any certain time in this life, after which we are not to attend upon the word written. For then, that certain time notified by the <HI>day dawning</HI> and <HI>the day-starr appearing:</HI> must either relate to Christs comming in the flesh, or to the beginning of the Gospel-dispensation, or to the effectual revelation of Christ in vocation, or to some other terme, that may rationally and scripturally be instanced in: but it cannot relate unto the first, because it is not <HI>an appearance in the flesh,</HI> but an <HI>appearance in the heart,</HI> that is here expresly spoken of: and <HI>the day-starr arise in your HEARTS.</HI> Neither indeed, can it relate either unto the first or any other of the termes, or limits mentioned: because <HI>Peter</HI> writes unto such, still to <HI>attend upon the word of Prophecie,</HI> who were regenerate; who were believers: <HI>have|ing obteined like precious faith with himself, Cap:</HI> 1.

follow, that this exhortation of the Apostle had then been as much after its time, as that <HI>terme</HI> of a believers attention unto the <HI>word of prophecy,</HI> be it either the incarnation, Gospel-dispensation, or regeneration of those; whom he puts upon this duty, was before t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s time. The Gospel (whether any of it were now written or not) was promulged by Christ &amp; his Apostles, and therefore was ob|liging.

<P>While the Church <HI>is in a darke place,</HI> the light of the Scripture is to be attended unto: hence the written word is here compared <HI>unto a light that shineth in a darke place&punc;</HI> now wee know, that there is much darkness, and obscurity in the hearts of all the Children of light, in this life. 1 <HI>Corin:</HI> 13. 9.</P>

<P>This notion agreeth not only with the analogie of faith, but also according to the mind of the Apostles commone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">action ex|hortatory, seemeth more readily to flow. The scope of <HI>Peter,</HI> is to confirm the hearts of the <HI>twelve tribes scattered abroad,</HI> con|cerning the trueth of the Gospel: this he doth by two arguments, The first taken from the testimony of the Apostles <HI>verse</HI> 15 16,17.

<P>If with some Orthodox Interpreters, wee understand by a <HI>dark place,</HI> the time of the Church under the old Testament: compared with the night, wherein candles are lighted: and by the <HI>day-dawning,</HI> the time of the Gospel day-light, wherein the Sun shin|eth; the new Testament expounding the old, and thereby giving a greater light.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="000056_0020_0F9F1CEFE73F4590">
Yet still we are to keep in mind, that as the New Testament giveth light unto the Old, so the Old Testament giveth light unto the New: they give light mutually one unto another.

<P>False Teachers, and false Prophets are signal; <HI>i.e,</HI> they are signes, that the time is come, when God will inflict vindicative spi|ritual-justice, upon the <HI>non-receivers of the Trueth on the love of it.</HI> They are executioners of spiritual-justice, punishing the <HI>non-recep|tion of the truth:</HI> with deception by their lyes.

<P><HI>I am come in my Fathers name, and ye receive me not: if ano|ther shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</HI> John 5.43.

<P>That this tremendous dispensation, may have the deeper impression upon our hearts: we find the Vindictive hand of God upon the contempt of the Gospel, mentioned thrice in one chapter: and that also, sometime as a forerunner of the destruction of a nation. <HI>Mat:</HI> 24. 5. <HI>For many shall come in my name, saying I am Christ.</HI> False teachers shall come, and lest any should think their comming notwithstanding, happily they shall not prevail: it is added, <HI>and shall deceive many.</HI> Again, verse 11. <HI>Many false pro|phets shall arise.</HI> Forget not again what followeth, <HI>and shall deceive many.</HI> So verse 24. <HI>For there shall arise false Christs, and false Prophets, and shall shew great signes &amp; wonders: insomuch; that if it were possible, they should deceive the very Elect.</HI> Hereunto (if with some learned interpreters, we understand by the <HI>end</HI> mention|ed <HI>Mat.</HI> 24. that famous period &amp; destruction of the Nation of the Jewes) we may not unaptly annex that of the Apostle 1 <HI>John</HI> 2. 18 in the judgment of some as attesting unto <HI>Mat.</HI> 25. 3,6,33,34.

<P>Sinning against the Gospel, is very sinfull. The Gospel is a con|stitution or effect <HI>tempered of the Grace of God, and the blood of Christ</HI> ingredients, neither of which are to be found in the Law. So much as the Gospel excelleth the Law, so much is <HI>sinning against the Gospel</HI> aggravated compared with <HI>sinning against the Law</HI> Sin|ning against the Gospel is yet heightned by circumstances: that it is given to us after the transgression of the Law. Given to some transgressors, and not unto others. Of them to whom it is given, dispensed with greater light to some, then to others. What Nation gloryed in these priviledges above our own, our selves being witnesses? From the kind of sinning; If the non-recep|tion of the trueth in the love of it, exposeth unto this vindictive deception, according to what dreadfull degree shall they be count|ed obnoxious, who persevere in scandals under the light? <HI>Count it pleasure to riot in the day time,</HI> yea fear not to <HI>commit that abomination in Israel, of turning the grace of God into wantonness.</HI> From the doctrine of free grace, drawing a licence to sin, to take their fill o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lust: and that without the guilt of sin, without the con|science of sin, yea with a pretended conscience of obedience. In a word, <HI>to feast the old man unto the highest, with the blood of Jesus,</HI> and compleat <HI>the mystery of iniquity, by the mystery of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>As the non-reception of the trueth of the Gospel, is a fearfull sin, so the fruit thereof is a fearfull evill.

<P>Practically: so; Order is according to some, not ineptly said to be of the foundation: in that it is requisite, in the way of means for the preservation of what is fundamentall.</P>
<P>For the making good the first &amp; maine article of the charge; the clearenes of the trueth, of the heads instanced in, as the four parts thereof (their fundamentality, with the contrariety of the doctrine-impleaded thereunto being manifest) is necessary.

That the visible-politicall-Churches, Church-Officers Church-worship &amp; administrations, are Gospel-institutions, appointed by Christ, to continue to the end of the world.</P>

Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tnias</HI> sub|stituted in the place of <HI>Judas,</HI> is elected by Lot, which was a di|vine vote. <HI>Acts</HI> 1. 26. <HI>Paul</HI> hath a vision of Christ, and heareth a voice from heaven. <HI>Acts</HI> 26. 16. 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 15.8. 2. <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itude and amplitude of the power of the Keyes, i.e.</HI> all Church-power in all Churches. <HI>John</HI> 21.21. <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.19. <HI>Mark</HI> 16.15. 3. <HI>Infalli|ble assistance</HI> in their administration, when called thereunto. 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.20,21. 4. <HI>Power to work Miracles,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 12.12.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prophets</HI> were called immediately by the Spirit: their work was to <HI>interpret dark Scriptures,</HI> by a special gift, without study. <HI>Acts</HI> 13.1. <HI>&amp;</HI> 15.32. 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 14. 24. <HI>Prediction of things to come, Acts</HI> 11. 27,28. <HI>&amp;</HI> 21.11. <HI>Joel</HI> 2 28. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.9. <HI>Luke</HI> 2.36 <HI>Acts</HI> 21.9. <HI>Evangelists</HI> were extraordinary Ministers called by the Apostles, as ordinary Ministers are by the Church. Such were <HI>Timothy &amp; Titus.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quest.</HI></NOTE> Touching the querie, <HI>whether we have any Scripture warrant to expect persons immediately sent of God in these dayes.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answ.</NOTE> <HI>We have no promise of any such ministry in our times. The last dayes Acts</HI> 2.17. are by some senced, as relating to the last dayes of the Jewes immediately preceding the dreadfull &amp; famous de|struction of that Nation. (According to them) called <HI>he great &amp; terrible day of the Lord.</HI> Thus <HI>James</HI> chapt.5.3. speaking of
<PB N="35" REF="000056_0036_0F9F1D0229C5CD48">
the wealthy Jewes saith, that they have <HI>treasured up their wealth as s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e against the last dayes i.e.</HI> against those times of destruction when their wealth should but do them a mischief, making them out as prizes &amp; preyes for the enemy. But this interpretation is left to free disquisition.</P>
<P>The Apostles seem not so to have expected any succession of Apostles. Hence in their life time, they appointed <HI>Elders in every Church, Acts</HI> 14. 23. And left behind them, a prescribed form, as a directory of the Churches, concerning persons to be called by man into the Ministry successively, in the ages to come. 1 <HI>Tim:</HI> 3 <HI>Titus</HI> 1.</P>
<P>But though we have no promise of any such ministry, yet in the Scripture we have frequent prediction &amp; caution of pretenders to <HI>immediate mission, of deceivers, false Apostles, false Prophets, false Teachers, Speakers of lyes in the name of the Lord:</HI> with <HI>Command</HI> and directions <HI>to try them,</HI> not by their own <HI>profession,</HI> for that is no great thing, if <HI>the ministers of Satan transform themselves into the ministers of Righteousness.</HI> 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 11. 15. Nor so much by their <HI>Conversation,</HI> (for the trueth were not true if such <HI>ravening Wolves did not come in sheeps cloathing:</HI>) as by their <HI>doctrine,</HI> by which fruit they are in an especial manner to be known <HI>Mat.</HI> 7. 16. <HI>Iohn</HI> 2 Epist. 9,10. Yea, and upon just tryal, so farr ought we to bee from being moved by them, in point of our faith, as confident|ly to pronounce them <HI>Ana<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hama's.</HI> But though <HI>we or an Angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you, then that yee have received, let him be accursed.</HI> As we said before, so say I now again, <HI>if any man preach any other Gospel unto you, then that yee have received, let him be accursed. Seeptick,</HI> &amp; all others, are h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ce beseeched to consider what unmovednes and firmnes in fundamentalls Christ looks for, especially from those who would acquit themselves as Church-mem|bers, in reference to such deceivers.</P>
<P>Though we have no Scripture warrant to expect <HI>immediate missions,</HI> and have both frequent and solemn cautions concerning the rising of false pretenders thereunto, yet it being also a trueth, that <HI>the holy One of Israel,</HI> hath not limited himself herein. When any arise with the gifts prementioned, and with the fruits both of doctrine &amp; life conformable to the Scripture, they are according|ly to be received in the Lord.</P>

errour of his Conscience, and (himself being witness) from his ignorance, which is of sin and Satan, but not of God.</P>
<P>The object subjected to the Coercive power of the Magistrate, must be some Act of the outward man. Tis not <HI>matter of judge|ment,</HI> but <HI>matter of fact,</HI> which Civil-power dealeth with. Hence so far is it from being a truth, that the magistrate proceeding accord|ing to Rule, either punisheth or troubleth any for their Conscience as that it neither doth nor can concern him, to meddle with the errour of their Conscience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lex non Ju|dicar de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> as such, be it heresye; or whatsoever. Whilst a-man keepeth his heterodoxy to himself, he is doubtlesse out of the reach of the Magistrate in that respect&punc;</P>
<P>Conscience, properly so called, error of Conscience or heresy, heresy uttered &amp; retracted, heresy uttered &amp; not retracted but quiet,(called heresy alone) &amp; heresy Turbulent are all distinct, &amp; of distinct con|sideration. <HI>Heresy, schimse, and sedition, differ.</HI> Though usually it falls out otherwise, yet a man may be an heretick, who is neither dogmatist, schismatick, or seditious: neither teaching his errours as truthes, nor causing irregular separation from Church-Co~munion, nor sowing seeds of discord, or mutiny in the Common-wealth.</P>
<P>By <HI>Quiet heresy,</HI> or heresy alone; understand heresy although uttered and not retracted, yet without endeavour either directly or indirectly tending to induce others to receive their errours: As also; without disturbance of publick order, either ecclesiast color Civil. This; divers godly-learned do not only exempt from the number of Capitals, but also seeme Cautious, if not silent, concerning subjecting it to any Corporal punishment.</P>
<P>By <HI>Heresy Turbulent,</HI> understand heresy both uncured and incorrigible; <HI>i e.</HI> in Coniunct on either with, <HI>Teaching lyes in the name of the Lord.</HI> Or with disturbance of publick-order, whether Ecclesiastical or Civil. This is not only heretical, but also pestilen|tial, and here is a season, wherein it is the duety of the Civil-Ma|gistrate, to put forth his Coercive power, as the matter shall require in the defence of Religion, Order, Church &amp; common-wealth.</P>
<P>So farr is our doctrine from asserting subjection of the Con|science, to the Coercive power of the Magistrate: as that we look at it as irrational, to extend his power unto the error of Conscience as such. We subject not the bare proposal &amp; owning of heresie is cured: as obnoxious unto Civil authority. We affirm not that it belongs to the Magistrate to inflict any punishment for quiet

heresie. We affirm not quiet heresie to fall within the necessary object of Magistratical Cognisance, but leave it unto free disquisi|tion. We know that it belongeth not unto the Magistrate to compel any man to be a believer, nor to punish any for not being a believer. But we believe it belongs to him (in case) to punish a Blasphemer, or turbulent hereticks, who seeth not a wide diffe|rence between these?</P>
<P>Wee through grace abhorre prejudicing the liberty of Consci|ence in the least measure, and account such report of us to be a slan|der. And through the same grace; Wee both dread, and beare witness against, liberty of heresy, liberty to Blaspheme the Blessed Trinity, the Person and Office of Christ, the holy-Scripture, the tabernacle of God, and those that dwell in heaven. Howsoever fallaciously transformed into, &amp; mis-represented under the plausible vizard of liberty of conscience falsly so called. We say Religion is to be perswaded with Scripture-reasons, not Civil weapons: with Arguments, not with punishments. But Blasphemies immediate and heresies carried on with an high hand, and persisted in, are to be suppressed with weapons &amp; punishments; where reasons, &amp; arguments cannot prevail.</P>

<P>We subject not any to Civil or Corporal punishment for he|resie, if <HI>quiet and alone.</HI> We do not inflict any Church-censure in case of heresie, without doctrinal conviction on the Churches part and contumacy on the delinquents part, foregoing.</P>
<P>In case of <HI>Heresie incorrigible,</HI> in conjunction with endea|vours to seduce others thereunto, and tending to disturbing of Publick-order, we accknowledg it to be the pious wisdom of the Magistrate, to proceed gradually, and where gentler meanes may rationally be looked at as effectual, there to abstain from the use of any severer remedie.</P>
<P>And according to this method, hath been the gradual pro|ceeding of the Magistrate here, with those (hitherto incorrigible) <HI>Quakers,</HI> who from England have unreasonably and insolently

<P>At last, upon experience of their bold contempt of these infe|rior restraints, &amp; that after their being sent away againe, &amp; again, they continue to returne, yet again and again: to the seducing of diverse, the disturbance, vexation, &amp; hazard of the whole Colonie: The Court finding the Law passed, to be an insufficient fence against, these persons, proceeded to a Sentence of Banishment.</P>
<P>Their restraint before the Law published, was but restraint in the Prison, until an opportunity of shipping them away. They who after the Law was published, would that notwithstanding break-in upon us from England, or other forraign parts, by Ro de-Island, after their correction received, and discharging their dues, might return again to the Island, if they pleased. The wolfe which ventures over the wide Sea, out of a ravening desire to prey upon the sheep, when landed, discovered &amp; taken, hath no cause to com|plain, though for the security of the flock, he be penned up, with that door opening unto the fold fast shot: but having another door purposely left open, whereby he may depart at his pleasure, either returning from whence he came, or otherwise quitting the place.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Sentence of Banishment</HI> as Circumstanced, by an Impar|tial and equal eye, may be looked upon as an Act which the court was forced unto <HI>So defendend,</HI> in defence of Religion, themselves, the Churches, and this poor State and People from Ruine: which the principles of confusion, daylie and studiously disseminated by them, threatned to bring all unto, if not seasonably prevented. <HI>Exile from a wildernes,</HI> from a place of exile; though voluntarie, from a place; confinement whereunto would indeed justly be counted exile, is <HI>an easie exile.</HI></P>

That a malefactor (especially such who <HI>chooseth sin rather then suffering</HI>) pleadeth for impunity, why should it seem strange? But to attempt the repre|senting of the application of the remedy of iniquity, as iniquity. Antichristianism, persecution, is indeed a device: and that as emp|ty of reason, as full of transgression, A piece of the sophistry of the Prince of darkness, to charm that sword into a perpetual scabbard by a fallacie, the dexterous &amp; vigorous use wherof, puts away the evill committed from, and for the time to come, prevents the com|mitting of evill in <HI>Israel.</HI> But Christians, especially Church-mem|bers, <HI>should not be ignorant of his devices.</HI> 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 2. 11.</P>

<P>The <HI>question is not concerning God's Power, but concerning his Will.</HI> God can preserve his Truth immediatly without any external meanes but his pleasure is ordinarily to doe it mediately. Hence he sur|rounded the Arke according to divine Institution, with a double sence, both Ecclesiastical and Civil. God can also save man im|mediately, from evils committed against the second Table, but hee ordinarily effects it by the helpe of the magistrate. The injurie done unto the trueth, hurteth man whose welfare depends upon the imbracing of it. It hurts not God, nor the Trueth in it self, but only in the estimation of man. As Satan is permitted to raise up men to be offendors, so Christ raiseth up men to be defenders thereof: to manifest that through Grace, the Trueth hath even amongst men as great lovers, as it hath haters.</P>
<P>When there was no Christian Magistrate, God watched over the cause of Religion in an extraordinary man~er. The continuance of the gift of miracle, together with the then recent &amp; fresh memo|ry therof, conducing nor a little for that end. But extraordinarie gifts ceasing, and the Christian Magistrate succeeding, God now ex|pects the Civil power, in an ordinary way of Providence to be sub|servient therunto. God can bring up his sons &amp; daughters with|out making any use of Civil power: but it hath pleased him to <HI>appoint Kings to be nursing Fathers, and Queens to be nursing Mothers unto them.</HI> They are but ill nurses, who seing the danger of those

<P><HI>Lysander's</HI> counsel of old was, when the lions skin will not hold out, to piece it with a fox skinne. Why should it seeme strange, that men speaking doctrines of devils, and lies in hypocrisie, having their <HI>Conscience scared with an hot iron,</HI> and therefore <HI>past feeling</HI> of spiritual weapons, object (may that serve their turn) against obnoxiousnes to Civill weapons, of which they remain only sensible, that so priviledged with impunity, they may proceed in their madness without all restraint. That ancient stratagem of de|stroyers (otherwise often frustrated in their attempts) to open their way unto their flock, by endeavouring the removal of the keepers is famously notable from <HI>Demosthenes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s recital of the folly of the sheep sometimes delivering up the doggs that kept them, at the motion of the wolves.

<P>That God makes use of Civil power, consequently of man: is not from his need of him, but his favour to him. Not from de|fect of power, but abundance of Goodness.

<P>Albeit; as the Heterodoxie of the Sectaries pre-mentioned in the last Centurie, was universal, corrupting the whole body of Religion: so also Quakerism (as to the substa~ce therof) their geniune offspring, be in like manner a total heresie, yet both because the former is legible in many Authors, and the latter obvious from the penns and tongues of the present Dogmatists, and because the scope of this discourse is chiefely practical, the Reader may soon perceive w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y (other errors omitted) the principal heads of their doctrine, are herein onely considered.</P>
