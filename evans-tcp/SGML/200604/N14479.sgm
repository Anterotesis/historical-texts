<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a new publication appears, &s;ome prefatory account of the rea&s;ons which led to it, and the manner in which it has been conducted, is generally expected.</P>
<P>The compiler of this hi&s;tory was early impel|led by his natural curio&s;ity to enquire into the original &s;ettlement, progre&s;s, and improvement of the country which gave him birth. When he took up his re&s;idence in New-Hamp&s;hire his en|quiries were more particularly directed to that part of it. Having met with &s;ome valuable ma|nu&s;cripts which were but little known, he began to extract and methodize the principal things in them; and this employment was (to &s;peak in the &s;tyle of a celebrated modern author) his "hobby hor&s;e."</P>
<P>The work, crude as it was, being communicated to &s;ome gentlemen, to who&s;e judgment he paid much deference, he was per&s;uaded and encouraged to go on with his collection, until the thing be|came generally known, and a publication could not decently be refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>He owns him&s;elf particularly obliged to the public officers both in this and the neighbouring &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, under the former as well as the pre&s;ent con&s;titutions, for their obliging at|tention in favouring him with the u&s;e of the pub|lic records or extracts from them. He is under
<PB N="iv" REF="018344_0004_0FA5D5E00D687308">
equal obligation to a number of private gentlemen, who have either admitted him to their own col|lections of original papers or procured &s;uch for him. In the cour&s;e of his enquiry he has fre|quently had rea&s;on to lament the lo&s;s of many valuable materials by fire and other accidents: But what has pained him more &s;everely is the in|attention of &s;ome per&s;ons in who&s;e hands original papers have been depo&s;ited, and who have &s;uffer|ed them to be wa&s;ted and de&s;troyed as things of no value The very great utility of a public re|po&s;itory for &s;uch papers under proper regulations, has appeared to him in the &s;tronge&s;t light, and he is per&s;uaded that it is an object worthy the atten|tion of an enlightened legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>The late accurate and indefatigable Mr. PRINCE of Bo&s;ton, (under who&s;e mini&s;try the author was educated and who&s;e memory he &s;hall always re|vere began &s;uch a collection in his youth and continued it for above fifty years. By his will he left it to the care of the Old South Church, of which he was pa&s;tor, and it was depo&s;ited with a library of ancient books in an apartment of their meeting-hou&s;e. To this collection, the public are obliged for &s;ome material hints in the pre|&s;ent work, the author having had frequent acce&s;s to that library before the commencement of the late war. But the u&s;e which the Briti&s;h troops in 1775 made of that elegant building having proved fatal to this noble collection of manu&s;cripts; the friends of &s;cience and of America mu&s;t de|plore the irretrievable lo&s;s. Had we &s;uffered it by the hands of SARACENS, the grief had been le&s;s poignant!</P>
<P>Hi&s;torians have mentioned the affairs of New-Hamp&s;hire only in a loo&s;e and general manner.
<PB N="v" REF="018344_0005_0FA5D5E32DE2A4A0">
Neale and Douglas, though frequently erroneous, have given &s;ome hints, which by the help of ori|ginal records and other manu&s;cripts, have in this work been carefully and largely pur&s;ued. Hutch|in&s;on has &s;aid many things which the others have omitted; his knowledge of the antiquities of the country was exten&s;ive and accurate, and the pub|lic are much obliged by the publication of his hi&s;tory; but he knew more than he thought pro|per to relate. The few publications concerning New-Hamp&s;hire are fugitive pieces dictated by party or intere&s;t. No regular hi&s;torical deduc|tion has ever appeared. The late Mr. FITCH of Port&s;mouth made a beginning of this &s;ort about the year 1728: From his papers &s;ome things have been collected which have not been met with el&s;e|where. The authorities from which information is derived are carefully noted in the margin. Where no written te&s;timonies could be obtained, recour&s;e has been had to the mo&s;t authentic tra|dition, &s;elected and compared with a &s;crupulous attention, and with proper allowance for the im|perfection of human memory. After all, the critical reader will doubtle&s;s find &s;ome cha&s;ms which in &s;uch a work it would be improper to fill by the help of imagination and conjecture.</P>
<P>The author makes no merit of his regard to truth. To have di&s;gui&s;ed or mi&s;repre&s;ented facts would have been abu&s;ing the reader. No per&s;on can take more plea&s;ure in detecting mi&s;takes than the author in correcting them if he &s;hould have opportunity. In tracing the progre&s;s of contro|ver&s;y it is impo&s;&s;ible not to take a &s;ide, though we are ever &s;o remote from any per&s;onal intere&s;t in it: Cen&s;ure or applau&s;e will naturally follow the opinion we adopt. If the reader &s;hould hap|pen
<PB N="vi" REF="018344_0006_0FA5D5E454374330">
to entertain different feelings from the writer, he has an equal right to indulge them; but not at the expence of candor.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;onian controver&s;y lay &s;o directly in the way that it could not be avoided. The rancour &s;hewn on both &s;ides in the early &s;tages of it has now &s;ub&s;ided. The pre&s;ent &s;ettlement is &s;o ma|terially connected with the general peace and wel|fare of the people, that no wi&s;e man or friend to the country can at this day wi&s;h to overthrow it.</P>
<P>Mr. HUBBARD, Dr. MATHER and Mr. PEN|HALLOW have publi&s;hed narratives of the &s;everal Indian wars: The&s;e have been compared with the public records, with ancient manu&s;cripts, with CHARLEVOIX's hi&s;tory of New-France, and with the verbal traditions of the immediate &s;ufferers or their de&s;cendants. The particular incidents of the&s;e wars may be tedious to &s;trangers, but will be read with avidity by the po&s;terity of tho&s;e who&s;e misfortunes and bravery were &s;o con&s;picu|ous. As the character of a people mu&s;t be col|lected from &s;uch a minute &s;eries, it would have been improper to have been le&s;s particular.</P>
<P>The writer has had it in view not barely to re|late facts, but to delineate the characters, the pa&s;|&s;ions, the intere&s;ts and tempers of the per&s;ons who are the &s;ubjects of his narration, and to de&s;cribe the mo&s;t &s;triking features of the times in which they lived. How far he has &s;ucceeded, or where|in he is defective, mu&s;t be left to the judgment of <HI>every candid reader,</HI> to which this work is mo&s;t re&s;pectfully &s;ubmitted.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is happy for America that its di&s;co|very and &s;ettlement by the Europeans happened at a time, when they were emerging from a long period of ignorance and darkne&s;s. The di&s;covery of the mag|netic needle, the invention of printing, the revival of literature and the reforma|tion of religion, had cau&s;ed a va&s;t alterati|on in their views, and taught them the true u&s;e of their rational and active pow|ers. To this concurrence of favourable cau&s;es we are indebted for the preci&s;ion with which we are able to fix the begin|ning of this great American empire: An advantage of which the hi&s;torians of other countries almo&s;t univer&s;ally are de&s;titute; their fir&s;t aeras being either di&s;gui&s;ed by
<PB N="2" REF="018344_0010_0FA5D5E75C357F20">
fiction and romance, or involved in impe|netrable ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Mankind do not ea&s;ily relinqui&s;h anci|ent and e&s;tabli&s;hed prejudices, or adopt new &s;y&s;tems of conduct, without &s;ome powerful attractive. The pro&s;pect of im|men&s;e wealth, from the mines of Mexico and Peru, fired the Spaniards to a rapid conque&s;t of tho&s;e regions and the de&s;truc|tion of their numerous inhabitants; but the northern continent, pre&s;enting no &s;uch glittering charms, was neglected by the European princes for more than a century after its di&s;covery.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1496.</NOTE> No effectual care was taken to &s;ecure to them&s;elves the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of &s;o exten&s;ive a territory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> or the ad|vantage of a friendly traffic with its na|tives, or of the fi&s;hery on its coa&s;ts; till private adventurers at a va&s;t expence, with infinite hazard and per&s;evering zeal, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed &s;ettlements for them&s;elves, and thereby enlarged the dominions of their &s;overeigns.</P>
<P>Of the voyagers who vi&s;ited the nor|thern coa&s;t of America, for the &s;ake of its furs and fi&s;h, one of the mo&s;t remarkable was Captain John Smith;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1614.</NOTE> who ranged the &s;hore from Penob&s;cot to Cape Cod, and in this route di&s;covered the river Pa&s;cataqua; which he found to be a &s;afe harbour with
<PB N="3" REF="018344_0011_0FA5D5E8128E03E8">
a rocky &s;hore. He returned to England in one of his &s;hips, and there publi&s;hed a de&s;cription of the country, with a map of the &s;ea-coa&s;t, which he pre&s;ented to Prince Charles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smith's Voyage.</NOTE> who gave it the name of NEW-ENGLAND. The other &s;hip he left be|hind under the care of Thomas Hunt, who decoyed about twenty of the natives on board and &s;old them for &s;laves at Ma|laga. This perfidious action excited a vi|olent jealou&s;y in the natives, and bitter|ly enraged them again&s;t &s;ucceeding ad|venturers. Two of tho&s;e &s;avages having found their way back as far as Newfound|land, then under the government of Cap|tain John Ma&s;on, were re&s;tored to their native country by his friendly interpo&s;i|tion, and reported the &s;trong di&s;approba|tion, which the Engli&s;h in general enter|tained of the mi&s;chievous plot by which they had been carried off. By this means, together with the prudent endeavours of Captain Thomas Dermer, and afterward of the Plymouth &s;ettlers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's printed Narrative of the trou|bles with the Indi|ans, p. 3.</NOTE> tranquillity was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed between the Indians and the adventurers, which was tolerably pre&s;erv|ed for many years. However fond we may have been of accu&s;ing the Indians of treachery and infidelity, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed that the example was fir&s;t &s;et them
<PB N="4" REF="018344_0012_0FA5D5E8E8782B20">
by the Europeans. Had we always treat|ed them with that ju&s;tice and humanity which our religion inculcates, and our true intere&s;t at all times required, we might have lived in as much harmony with them, as with any other people on the globe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1620.</NOTE>The importance of the country now began to appear greater than before, and &s;ome mea&s;ures were taken to promote its &s;ettlement. A patent had been granted by King James in 1606, limiting the do|minion of Virginia, from the thirty-fourth, to the forty-fourth degree of northern la|titude; which extent of territory had been divided into two parts, called North and South Virginia. The latter was a&s;&s;igned to certain noblemen, knights and gentle|men of London, the former to others in Bri&s;tol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gorge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s Narrative.</NOTE> Exeter and Plymouth. Tho&s;e who were intere&s;ted in the northern colony, finding that the patent did not &s;ecure them from the intru&s;ions of others, petitioned for an enlargement and confirmation of their privileges. After &s;ome time, the king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> by his &s;ole authority, con&s;tituted a council, con&s;i&s;ting of forty noblemen, knights and gentlemen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

They were a corporati|on with perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by election of the majority; and their territories ex|tended from the fortieth to the forty-eighth degree of northern latitude.

<PB N="6" REF="018344_0014_0FA5D5EC92116590">
&s;ome of which are not yet ended.</P>
<P>Two of the mo&s;t active members of this council were Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Captain John Ma&s;on. Gorges had been an officer in the navy of Queen Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hume.</NOTE> intimately connected with Sir Walter Ra|leigh, of who&s;e adventurous &s;pirit he had a large &s;hare. After the peace which King James made in 1604, he was appointed governor of the fort and i&s;land of Ply|mouth in Devon&s;hire. While he re&s;ided there, Captain Weymouth, who had been employed by Lord Arundel in &s;earch of a northwe&s;t pa&s;&s;age, but had fallen &s;hort of his cour&s;e and put in at Pemaquid, brought from thence into the harbour of Plymouth, five natives of America, three of whom were eagerly &s;eized by Gorges, and re|tained in his &s;ervice for three years. Find|ing them of a tractable and communicative di&s;po&s;ition, and having won their affecti|ons by gentle treatment, he learned from them many particulars concerning their country, its rivers, harbours, i&s;lands, fi&s;h|eries and other products; and the num|bers, force, di&s;po&s;ition and government of the natives; and from this information he conceived &s;anguine hopes of indulging his genius, and making his fortune, by a tho|rough

di&s;covery of the country. For this purpo&s;e he, in conjunction with others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gorges's Narrative.</NOTE> ventured &s;everal &s;hips, whereof &s;ome met with peculiar misfortunes; and others brought home accounts, which, though di&s;couraging to &s;ome of his a&s;&s;ociates, made him determine upon farther attempts, wherein his re&s;olution and per&s;everance were more con&s;picuous than any &s;olid gain. The&s;e tran&s;actions were previous to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the council; in &s;oliciting which, Gorges was &s;o extremely active, that he was appointed their pre&s;ident, and had a principal &s;hare in all their tran&s;ac|tions. Ma&s;on was a merchant of London, but became a &s;ea-officer, and, after the peace, governor of Newfoundland, where he acquired a knowledge of America, which led him, on his return to England, into a clo&s;e attachment to tho&s;e who were en|gaged in its di&s;covery; and upon &s;ome vacancy in the council, he was elected a member and became their &s;ecretary; be|ing al&s;o governor of Port&s;mouth in Hamp|&s;hire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1621.</NOTE> He procured a grant from the coun|cil, of all the land from the river Naum|keag, [now Salem] round Cape Anne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> to the river Merrimack; and up each of tho&s;e rivers to the farthe&s;t head thereof; then to cro&s;s over from the head of the one

<P>Troubles at Dover. Settlements of Exeter and Hampton. Ruin of Ma&s;on's intere&s;t. Story of Underhill. Combinations at Port&s;mouth and Dover. Union of New-Hamp&s;hire with Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE the lower plantation on the river Pa&s;cataqua lay under di&s;|couragement by the death of its principal patron, the upper &s;ettlement, though car|ried on with more &s;ucce&s;s, had peculiar difficulties to &s;truggle with. Two thirds of this patent belonged to &s;ome merchants of Bri&s;tol, the other third to &s;ome of Shrew&s;bury; and there was an agreement that the divi&s;ion &s;hould be made by indif|ferent men. Captain Wiggen who was &s;ent over to &s;uperintend their affairs, af|ter about one year's re&s;idence in the coun|try made a voyage to England, to pro|cure more ample means for carrying on the plantation. In the mean time tho&s;e of Bri&s;tol had &s;old their intere&s;t to the lords Say and Broke, George Willys and William Whiting, who continued Wig|gen in the agency, and procured a con&s;i|derable number of families in the We&s;t of England, &s;ome of whom were of good

e&s;tates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1633.</NOTE> and "of &s;ome account for religi|on,"<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Dover Re|cords.</NOTE>
to come over and increa&s;e the co|lony. It appears from ancient records that Wiggen had a power of granting lands to the &s;ettlers; but, as trade was their principal object, they took up &s;mall lots, intending to build a compact town on Dover Neck, which lies between two branches of the river, and is a fine, dry, and healthy &s;ituation; &s;o high as to com|mand all the neighbouring &s;hores, and af|ford a very exten&s;ive and delightful pro|&s;pect. On the mo&s;t inviting part of this eminence they built a meeting-hou&s;e, which was afterward &s;urrounded with an en|trenchment and flankarts, the remains of which are &s;till vi&s;ible. Wiggen al&s;o brought over William Leverich, a worthy and able puritan mini&s;ter; but his allowance from the adventurers proving too &s;mall for his &s;upport in a new country, where all the nece&s;&s;aries of life were &s;carce and dear, he was obliged to remove to the &s;outhward; and &s;ettled at Sandwich in the colony of Plymouth. This proved an unhappy event to the people, who, being left de|&s;titute of regular in&s;truction, were expo&s;ed to the intru&s;ions of artful impo&s;tors.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e was one Burdet.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1634.</NOTE> He had been a mini&s;ter at Yarmouth in Eng|land;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's MS Hi&s;t.</NOTE> but either really or pretendedly tak|ing

offence at the extravagancies of the bi&s;hops and &s;piritual courts, came over to New-England, and joined with the church in Salem, who employed him for a year or two as a preacher, being a good &s;cho|lar and plau&s;ible in his behaviour. But, di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;trictne&s;s of their di&s;|cipline,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1636.</NOTE> he removed to Dover; and con|tinued for &s;ome time in good e&s;teem with the people as a preacher; until by artful in&s;inuations he rai&s;ed &s;uch a jealou&s;y in their minds again&s;t Wiggen their gover|nor, that they deprived him of his office, and elected Burdet in his place.</P>
<P>During his re&s;idence here, he carried on a corre&s;pondence with Archbi&s;hop Laud to the di&s;advantage of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts colony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1637.</NOTE> repre&s;enting them as hypocritical and di&s;affected, and that under pretence of greater purity and di&s;cipline in matters of religion, they were aiming at indepen|dent &s;overeignty; it being accounted per|jury and trea&s;on by their general court, to &s;peak of appeals to the king. The pre|late thanked him for his zeal in the king's &s;ervice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1638.</NOTE> and a&s;&s;ured him that care &s;hould be taken to redre&s;s tho&s;e di&s;orders when lei&s;ure from their other concerns would permit. This letter of the arch|bi&s;hop was intercepted, and &s;hewn to the governor of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Burdet's vil|lainy
<PB N="35" REF="018344_0043_0FA5D60C6D05FC58">
was con&s;idered as the more atrocious, becau&s;e he had been admitted a freeman of their corporation, and had taken the oath of fidelity. A copy of his own letter was afterward found in his clo&s;et.</P>
<P>About this time, the Antinomian con|trover&s;y at Bo&s;ton having occa&s;ioned the bani&s;hment of the principal per&s;ons of that &s;ect, &s;everal of them retired to this &s;ettle|ment, being without the juri&s;diction of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. When this was known, Governor Winthrop wrote to Wiggen, Burdet and others of this plantation, <Q>that as there had hitherto been a good corre|&s;pondence between them it would be much re&s;ented if they &s;hould receive the exiles; and intimating the intention of the general court to &s;urvey the utmo&s;t limits of their patent, and make u&s;e of them.</Q>
To this Burdet returned a &s;cornful an&s;wer, refu&s;ing to give the go|vernor his title. The governor thought of citing him to court to an&s;wer for his contempt; but was di&s;&s;uaded from it by Dudley, the deputy-governor, who judg|ed it imprudent to exa&s;perate him, le&s;t he &s;hould avenge him&s;elf by farther accu&s;ing them to their enemies in England.

an high degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m, he made a capital figure in the controver&s;y; being one of the &s;ub&s;cribers to a petition in which the court was cen&s;ured, with an indecent &s;everity, for their proceedings again&s;t Whelewright. For this offence he was disfranchi&s;ed. He then made a voyage to England;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 15th, 1637.</NOTE> and upon his return petitioned the court for three hundred acres of land which had been promi&s;ed him for his former &s;ervices, intending to remove after Whele|wright.

On this occa&s;ion the court thought proper to que&s;tion him concerning an offen&s;ive expre&s;&s;ion, which he had uttered on board the &s;hip in which he came from England, <Q>that the go|vernment at Bo&s;ton were as zealous as the &s;cribes and Phari&s;ees, and as Paul before his conver&s;ion.</Q>
He denied the charge, and it was proved to his face by a woman who was pa&s;&s;enger with him, and whom he had endeavoured to &s;educe to his opinions. He wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> al&s;o que&s;tioned for what he had &s;aid to her concerning the manner of his receiv|ing

a&s;&s;urance, which was, <Q>that having long lain under a &s;pirit of bondage, he could get no a&s;&s;urance; till at length as he was taking a pipe of tobacco, the &s;pirit &s;et home upon him an ab&s;olute promi&s;e of free grace, with &s;uch a&s;&s;urance and joy that he had never &s;ince doubt|ed of his good e&s;tate, neither &s;hould he, whatever &s;ins he might fall into.</Q>
This he would neither own nor deny; but ob|jected to the &s;ufficiency of a &s;ingle te&s;ti|mony. The court committed him for abu&s;ing them with a pretended retraction, and the next day pa&s;&s;ed the &s;entence of bani&s;hment upon him. Being allowed the liberty of attending public wor&s;hip, his enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal brake out in a &s;peech in which he endeavoured to prove <Q>that as the Lord was plea&s;ed to convert Saul while he was per&s;ecuting, &s;o he might manife&s;t him&s;elf to him while making a moderate u&s;e of the good creature to|bacco; profe&s;&s;ing withal that he knew not wherein he had de&s;erved the cen|&s;ure of the court.</Q>
The elders reprov|ed him for this incon&s;iderate &s;peech; and Mr. Cotton told him, <Q>that though God often laid a man under a &s;pirit of bon|dage while walking in &s;in, as was the ca&s;e with Paul, yet he never &s;ent a &s;pi|rit

The &s;ame week he was privately dealt with on &s;u&s;|picion of adultery, which he di&s;regarded; and therefore on the next &s;abbath was que&s;tioned for it before the church; but the evidence not being &s;ufficient to con|vict him, the church could only admoni&s;h him.</P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal, being fini&s;hed, he removed out of their juri&s;diction; and after a while came to Dover, where he procured the place of governor in the room of Burdet. Gover|nor Winthrop hearing of this, wrote to Hilton and others of this plantation, in|forming them of his character. Under|hill intercepted the letter, and returned a bitter an&s;wer to Mr. Cotton; and wrote another letter full of reproaches again&s;t the governor to a gentleman of his family, while he addre&s;&s;ed the governor him&s;elf in a fawning ob&s;equious &s;train, begging an obliteration of former mi&s;carriages, and a bearing with human infirmities. The&s;e letters were all &s;ent back to Hilton; but too late to prevent his advancement.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="018344_0052_0FA5D6151DE69E08"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1639.</NOTE>Being &s;ettled in his government, he pro|cured a church to be gathered at Dover who cho&s;e Han&s;erd Knollys for their mi|ni&s;ter. He had come over from Eng|land the year before; but being an Ana|bapti&s;t of the Antinomian ca&s;t, was not well received in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and came here while Burdet was in office, who for|bad his preaching; but Underhill, agree|ing better with him, prevailed to have him cho&s;en their mini&s;ter. To ingratiate him|&s;elf with his new patron, Knollys wrote in his favour to the church in Bo&s;ton; &s;tyling him "The right wor&s;hipful their honoured governor." Notwith&s;tanding which they cited him again to appear be|fore them; the court granting him &s;afe conduct. At the &s;ame time complaint was made to the chief inhabitants on the river, of the breach of friend&s;hip in ad|vancing Underhill after his rejection; and a copy of Knollys's letter was returned, wherein he had written that <Q>Underhill was an in&s;trument of God for their ruin,</Q>
and it was enquired whether that letter was written by the de&s;ire or con&s;ent of the people. The principal per|&s;ons of Port&s;mouth and Dover di&s;claimed his mi&s;carriages, and expre&s;&s;ed their rea|dine&s;s to call him to account when a pro|per

By his in&s;tigation Knollys had al|&s;o written to his friends in England, a ca|lumnious letter again&s;t the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts planters, repre&s;enting them as more arbi|trary than the high-commi&s;&s;ion court, and that there was no real religion in the coun|try. A copy of this letter being &s;ent from England to Governor Winthrop, Knollys was &s;o a&s;hamed at the di&s;covery, that ob|taining a licence, he went to Bo&s;ton; and at the public lecture before the governor, magi&s;trates, mini&s;ters and the congregation, made confe&s;&s;ion of his fault, and wrote a retraction to his friends in England, which he left with the governor to be &s;ent to them.</P>
<P>Underhill was &s;o affected with his friend's humiliation, and the di&s;affection of the peo|ple of Pi&s;cataqua to him, that he re&s;olved to retrieve his character in the &s;ame way. Having obtained &s;afe conduct, he went to Bo&s;ton, and in the &s;ame public manner ac|knowledged his adultery, his di&s;re&s;pect to the government and the ju&s;tice of their proceedings again&s;t him: But his confe&s;|&s;ion was mixed with &s;o many excu&s;es and extenuations that it gave no &s;atisfaction; and the evidence of his &s;candalous deport|ment

being now undeniable, the church pa&s;&s;ed the &s;entence of excommunication, to which he &s;eemed to &s;ubmit, and appear|ed much dejected while he remained there.</P>
<P>Upon his return, to plea&s;e &s;ome di&s;af|fected per&s;ons at the mouth of the river, he &s;ent thirteen armed men to Exeter to re&s;cue out of the officer's hand one Fi&s;h, who had been taken into cu&s;tody for &s;peaking again&s;t the king. The people of Dover forbad his coming into their court till they had con&s;idered his crimes and he promi&s;ed to re&s;ign his place if they &s;hould di&s;approve his conduct; but hear|ing that they were determined to remove him, he ru&s;hed into court in a pa&s;&s;ion, took his &s;eat, ordered one of the magi|&s;trates to pri&s;on for &s;aying that he would not &s;it with an adulterer, and refu&s;ed to receive his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, when they voted it.

<PB N="47" REF="018344_0055_0FA5D61810723098">
came to Dover; and being a preach|er of good talents, eclip&s;ed Knollys, and rai&s;|ed a party who determined to remove him. He therefore gave way to the popular pre|judice, and &s;uffered Larkham to take his place; who &s;oon di&s;covered his licentious principles by receiving into the church per&s;ons of immoral characters, and a&s;&s;um|ing, like Burdet, the civil as well as ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical authority. The better &s;ort of the people were di&s;plea&s;ed and re&s;tored Knollys to his office who excommunicated Larkham. This bred a riot in which Lark|ham laid hands on Knollys, taking away his hat on pretence that he had not paid for it; but he was civil enough afterward to return it. Some of the magi&s;trates joined with Larkham, and forming a court, &s;ummoned Underhill, who was of Knollys's party to appear before them, and an&s;wer to a new crime which they had to alledge again&s;t him. Underhill collected his adherents; Knollys was armed with a pi&s;tol, and another had a bible mounted on an halbert for an en|&s;ign. In this ridiculous parade they marched again&s;t Larkham and his party, who prudently declined a combat, and &s;ent down the river to Williams the go|vernor, at Port&s;mouth, for a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

He came up in a boat with an armed party, be&s;et Knollys's hou&s;e where Under|hill was, guarded it night and day till a court was &s;ummoned, and then, Williams &s;itting as judge, Underhill and his company were found guilty of a riot, and after be|ing fined, were bani&s;hed the plantation. The new crime which Larkham's party alledged again&s;t Underhill was that he had been &s;ecretly endeavouring to per|&s;uade the inhabitants to offer them&s;elves to the government of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, who&s;e favor he was de&s;irous to purcha&s;e, by the&s;e means, as he knew that their view was to extend their juri&s;diction as far as they imagined their limits reached, when|ever they &s;hould find a favourable oppor|tunity. The &s;ame policy led him with his party to &s;end a petition to Bo&s;ton, praying for the interpo&s;ition of the govern|ment in their ca&s;e: In con&s;equence of which the governor and a&s;&s;i&s;tants com|mi&s;&s;ioned Simon Brad&s;treet, E&s;q. with the famous Hugh Peters, then mini&s;ter of Salem, and Timothy Dalton of Hampton, to enquire into the matter, and effect a reconciliation, or certify the &s;tate of things to them. The&s;e gentlemen travelled on foot to Dover, and finding both &s;ides in fault, brought the matter to this i&s;&s;ue,

<P>In the heat of the&s;e di&s;putes, a di&s;covery was made of Knollys's failure in point of cha&s;tity. He acknowledged his crime before the church; but they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him and he returned to England, where he &s;uffered by the &s;everity of the long parliament in 1644;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neal's Hi&s;t.

<P>Four di&s;tinct governments (including one at Kittery on the north &s;ide of the river) were now formed on the &s;everal branches of Pa&s;cataqua.

The di&s;tractions in England at this time had cut off all hope of the royal attention, and the people of the &s;everal &s;ettlements were too much divided in their opinions to form any general plan of government which could afford a pro&s;pect of perma|nent utility. The more con&s;iderate per&s;ons among them, therefore thought it be&s;t to treat with Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts about taking them under their protection.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AN union having been formed between the &s;ettlements on Pa&s;cataqua and the colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, their hi&s;tory for the &s;ucceeding forty years is in a great mea&s;ure the &s;ame. It is not my intention to write the tran&s;actions of the whole co|lony during that period; but, as many of the people in New-Hamp&s;hire had the &s;ame principles, views and intere&s;ts with the other people of New-England, I &s;hall make &s;ome ob&s;ervations thereon, and in|ter&s;per&s;e &s;uch hi&s;torical facts as may illu|&s;trate the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the preceding century the holy &s;crip|tures, which had long lain hid in the rub|bi&s;h of mona&s;tic libraries, were brought to public view by the happy invention of printing; and as darkne&s;s vani&s;hes before the ri&s;ing &s;un, &s;o the light of divine truth
<PB N="61" REF="018344_0069_0FA5D624DB8EDEE0">
began to di&s;&s;ipate tho&s;e errors and &s;uper|&s;titions in which Europe had long been involved. At the &s;ame time a remarkable concurrence of circum&s;tances gave peculi|ar advantage to the bold attempt of Luther, to rou&s;e Germany from her inglorious &s;ubjection to the Roman Pontiff, and ef|fectuate a reformation, which &s;oon &s;pread into the neighbouring countries. But &s;o intimately were the political intere&s;ts of kingdoms and &s;tates blended with religious prejudices, that the work, though happily begun, was greatly blemi&s;hed and im|peded.</P>
<P>Henry the VIIIth of England took ad|vantage of this amazing revolution in the minds of men, to throw off the papal yoke, and a&s;&s;ert his native claim to independence. But &s;o dazzling was the idea of power, and the example of the fir&s;t chri&s;tian princes, who had exerci&s;ed a &s;uperintendency in &s;pirituals, as well as temporals, that he transferred to him&s;elf that &s;piritual power which had been u&s;urped and exerci&s;ed by the bi&s;hops of Rome, and &s;at up him&s;elf as &s;upreme head on earth of the church of England; commanding both clergy and laity in his dominions to &s;wear allegiance to him in this newly a&s;&s;umed character.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="018344_0070_0FA5D625A88B7C70">This claim was kept up by his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or Edward the Sixth, in who&s;e reign the reformation gained much ground; and a &s;ervice-book was publi&s;hed by royal au|thority as the &s;tandard of wor&s;hip and di&s;|cipline for his &s;ubjects. This excellent prince was taken out of the world in his youth; and his &s;i&s;ter Mary, who then came to the throne, re&s;tored the &s;upremacy to the pope, and rai&s;ed &s;uch fiery per&s;ecu|tion again&s;t the reformers, that many of them fled into Germany and the Nether|lands; where they departed from that uniformity which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, and became divided in their &s;en|timents and practice re&s;pecting eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal affairs: the native effect of that ju&s;t liberty of con&s;cience which they enjoyed abroad, pur&s;uing their own enquiries ac|cording to their re&s;pective mea&s;ures of light; uninfluenced by &s;ecular power, or the hope of acquiring dignities in a nati|onal e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The acce&s;&s;ion of Elizabeth in&s;pired them with new hopes; and they returned home, re&s;olving to attempt the reformation of the church of England, agreeably to the re|&s;pective opinions which they had embrac|ed in their exile. But they &s;oon found that the queen, who had been educated in
<PB N="63" REF="018344_0071_0FA5D62654D81AF8">
the &s;ame manner with her brother Ed|ward, was fond of the e&s;tabli&s;hment made in his reign, and was &s;trongly prejudiced in favor of pomp and ceremony in religi|ous wor&s;hip. She a&s;&s;erted her &s;upremacy in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute terms, and erected an high-commi&s;&s;ion court with juri&s;diction in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. Uniformity being rigorou&s;ly enjoined and no abatement or allowance made for tender con&s;ciences (though it was conceded that the ceremo|nies were indifferent) a &s;eparation from the e&s;tabli&s;hment took place. Tho&s;e who were de&s;irous of a farther reformation from the Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;titions, and of a more pure and perfect form of religion were deno|minated <HI>Puritans;</HI> who&s;e principles, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of the other re|formers who were in favor with the queen, are thus repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>"The queen and court-reformers held, 1. That every prince had the &s;ole autho|rity to correct all abu&s;es of doctrine and wor&s;hip within his own territories.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Hi&s;t. Puritans, vol. I p. 95.98 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> 2. That the church of Rome was a true church though corrupt in &s;ome points of doctrine and government; that all her mini&s;trati|ons were valid, and that the pope was a true bi&s;hop of Rome though not of the univer&s;al church. 3. That the &s;criptures
<PB N="64" REF="018344_0072_0FA5D62744F08E90">
were a perfect rule of faith, but not a &s;tandard of di&s;cipline; and that it was left to the di&s;cretion of the chri&s;tian magi&s;trate, to accommodate the government of the church to the policy of the &s;tate. 4. That the practice of the primitive church for the fir&s;t four or five centuries was a proper &s;tandard of church government and di&s;ci|pline; and in &s;ome re&s;pects better than that of the apo&s;tles, which was only ac|commodated to the infant &s;tate of the church, while it was under per&s;ecution; whereas the other was &s;uited to the gran|deur of a national e&s;tabli&s;hment. 5. That things indifferent in their own nature as rites, ceremonies, and habits, might be &s;ettled, determined and made nece&s;&s;ary by the command of the civil magi&s;trate, and that in &s;uch ca&s;es it was the duty of the &s;ubject to ob&s;erve them."</P>
<P>"On the other hand, the puritans, 1. Di&s;owned all foreign juri&s;diction over the church, but could not admit of that exten|&s;ive power which the crown claimed by the &s;upremacy. However, they took the oath, with the queen's explication, as only re&s;toring her maje&s;ty to the ancient and natural rights of &s;overeign princes over their &s;ubjects. 2. They held the pope to be antichri&s;t, the church of Rome a fal&s;e
<PB N="65" REF="018344_0073_0FA5D628D2076EC8">
church, and all her mini&s;trations &s;uper&s;ti|tious and idolatrous. 3. That the &s;crip|tures were a &s;tandard of di&s;cipline as well as doctrine, and if there was need of a di&s;|cretionary power, it was ve&s;ted not in the magi&s;trate but in the officers of the church. 4. That the form of government ordained by the apo&s;tles was ari&s;tocratical, and de|&s;igned as a pattern to the church in after ages, not to be departed from in its main principles. 5. That tho&s;e things which Chri&s;t hath left indifferent ought not to be made nece&s;&s;ary; and that &s;uch rites and ceremonies as had been abu&s;ed to ido|latry and &s;uper&s;tition, and had a manife&s;t tendency to lead men back thereto, were no longer indifferent but unlawful."</P>
<P>"Both parties agreed too well in a&s;&s;ert|ing the nece&s;&s;ity of uniformity in public wor&s;hip, and of u&s;ing the &s;word of the magi&s;trate for the &s;upport and defence of their re&s;pective principles; which they made an ill u&s;e of in their turns, whenever they could gra&s;p it in their hands. The &s;tandard of uniformity according to the bi&s;hops, was the queen's &s;upremacy and the laws of the land; according to the puritans, the decrees of national and pro|vincial &s;ynods, allowed and enforced by the civil magi&s;trate. Neither party were
<PB N="66" REF="018344_0074_0FA5D62957CE44D0">
for admitting that liberty of con&s;cience and freedom of profe&s;&s;ion which is every man's right, &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the peace of civil government. Upon this fatal rock of <HI>uniformity,</HI> was the peace of the church of England &s;plit."</P>
<P>It is melancholy to ob&s;erve what mi&s;|chiefs were cau&s;ed by the want of a ju&s;t di&s;|tinction between civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, and by that ab&s;urd zeal for uniform|ity, which kept the nation in a long fer|ment, and at length bur&s;t out into a blaze, the fury of which was never thoroughly quelled till the happy genius of the revoluti|on gave birth to a free and equitable <HI>tolerati|on,</HI> whereby every man was re&s;tored to the natural right of judging and acting for him&s;elf in matters of religion. All the celebrated wi&s;dom of Elizabeth's govern|ment could not devi&s;e an expedient &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sful. Though her reign was long and pro&s;perous, yet it was much &s;tained with oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty toward many of her be&s;t &s;ubjects; who, wearied with ineffec|tual applications, waited the acce&s;&s;ion of James, from whom they expected more favour, becau&s;e he had been educated in the pre&s;byterian church of Scotland, and profe&s;&s;ed an high veneration for that e&s;ta|bli&s;hment. But they &s;oon found that he
<PB N="67" REF="018344_0075_0FA5D62C45E3B890">
had changed his religious principles with his climate, and that nothing was to be ex|pected from a prince of &s;o ba&s;e a character, but in&s;ult and contempt.</P>
<P>In the beginning of his reign a great number of the puritans removed into Hol|land, where they formed churches upon their own principles. But not reli&s;hing the manners of the Dutch, after twelve years they projected a removal to America, and laid the foundation of the colony of Plymouth. The &s;pirit of uniformity &s;till prevailing in England, and being carried to the greate&s;t extent in the reign of Charles the Fir&s;t by that furious bigot Archbi&s;hop Laud; many of the le&s;s &s;crupulous, but con&s;cientious members of the church of England, who had hitherto remained in her communion, &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of re&s;t or liberty in their native country, follow|ed their brethren to America, and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed the colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, from which proceeded that of Connecticut.</P>
<P>By &s;uch men, influenced by &s;uch motives, were the principal &s;ettlements in New-England effected. The fortitude and per&s;everance which they exhibited therein will always render their memory dear to their po&s;terity. To prepare for their enterprize, they had to &s;ell their
<PB N="68" REF="018344_0076_0FA5D62C67AA53D0">
e&s;tates, &s;ome of which were large and valu|able, and turn them into materials for a new plantation, with the nature of which they had no acquaintance, and of which they could derive no knowledge from the expe|rience of others. After traver&s;ing a wide ocean they found them&s;elves in a country full of woods, to &s;ubdue which required immen&s;e labour and patience; at a va&s;t di&s;tance from any civilized people; in the neighbourhood of none but ignorant and barbarous &s;avages; and in a climate, where a winter much more &s;evere than they had been accu&s;tomed to, reigns for a third part of the year. Their &s;tock of provi&s;ions falling &s;hort, they had the dreadful apprehen&s;ion of peri&s;hing by famine, one half of their number dying before the fir&s;t year was completed; the ocean on one &s;ide &s;eparated them from their friends, and the wilderne&s;s on the other, pre&s;ented nothing but &s;cenes of hor|ror, which it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to conceive of before they endured them.</P>
<P>But under all the&s;e difficulties, they maintained a &s;teady and pious re&s;olution; depending on the providence of the &s;upreme ruler, and never repenting the bu&s;ine&s;s on which they had come into this wilderne&s;s. As purity in divine admini&s;trations was the

To be out of the reach of pre|latic tyranny, and at full liberty to pur|&s;ue their own enquiries, and wor&s;hip God according to their con&s;ciences, (which had been denied them in their own country) was e&s;teemed the greate&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;weetened every bitter cup which they were obliged to drink.

<Q>Brethren (&s;aid he) we are now quickly to part from one another, and whether I may ever live to &s;ee your face on earth any more, the God of heaven only knows; but whether the Lord hath appointed that or no, I charge you be|fore God and his ble&s;&s;ed angels that you follow me no further than you have &s;een me follow the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

receive it, as ever you were to receive any truth by my mini&s;try; for I am verily per&s;uaded, I am very confident, the Lord has more truth yet to break forth out of his holy word. For my part, I cannot &s;ufficiently bewail the con|dition of the reformed churches, who are come to a period in religion, and will go at pre&s;ent no farther than the in&s;tru|ments of their reformation. The Lu|therans cannot be drawn to go beyond what Luther &s;aw; whatever part of his will our good God has revealed to Cal|vin, they will rather die than embrace it. And the Calvini&s;ts you &s;ee &s;tick fa&s;t where they were left by that great man of God, who yet &s;aw not all things. This is a mi&s;ery much to be lamented; for though they were burning and &s;hining lights in their times, yet they penetrated not in|to the whole coun&s;el of God; but were they now living, would be as willing to embrace farther light, as that which they at fir&s;t received.

This article (like divers o|thers in that work) is curiou&s;ly and artful|ly drawn up, &s;o that there is an appearance of liberty and tenderne&s;s but none in reali|ty: For although the magi&s;trate was not to re&s;train any good works, yet <HI>he</HI> was to be the judge of the good or evil of the works to be re&s;trained; and what &s;ecurity could churches have that they &s;hould not be re&s;trained in the performance of what <HI>they</HI> judged to be good works? They might indeed think them&s;elves &s;afe, while their rulers were &s;o zealous for the purity of the churches of which them&s;elves were mem|bers, and while their mini&s;ters were con|&s;ulted in all eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs; but if the civil powers had acted without &s;uch con|&s;ultation, or if the mini&s;ters had been in|duced to yield to the opinion of the ma|gi&s;trates, when contrary to the intere&s;t of the churches, what then would have be|come of religious liberty?</P>
<P>The idea of liberty in matters of religi|on was in that day &s;trangely under&s;tood, and my&s;teriou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed. The venera|ble Higgin&s;on of Salem in his &s;ermon on the day of the election 1663, &s;peaks thus; 
<Q><PB N="83" REF="018344_0091_0FA5D639ECD3EFD8">The go&s;pel of Chri&s;t hath a right para|mount all rights in the world; it hath a divine and &s;upreme right to be receiv|ed in every nation, and the knee of ma|gi&s;tracy is to bow at the name of Je&s;us. This right carries liberty along with it, for all &s;uch as profe&s;s the go&s;pel, to walk according to the faith and order of the go&s;pel. That which is contrary to the go&s;pel hath no right, and therefore &s;hould have no liberty.</Q>
Here the que&s;tion ari&s;es, Who is to be the judge of what is agreeable or contrary to the go&s;pel? If the magi&s;trate, then there is only a liberty to believe and practi&s;e what the magi&s;trate thinks right.

This is the great Diana of the libertines of this age. But remember that as long as you have liberty to walk in the faith and order of the go&s;pel, and may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty, you have as much liberty of con&s;cience as Paul de|&s;ired under any government.</Q>
Here the que&s;tion recurs, Would Paul have &s;ub|mitted to walk according to the opinion which the magi&s;trate might entertain of

the faith and order of the go&s;pel? But this was all the freedom allowed by the &s;pirit of the&s;e times. Liberty of con&s;cience and toleration were offen&s;ive terms, and they who u&s;ed them were &s;uppo&s;ed to be the enemies of religion and government. <Q>I look upon toleration (&s;ays the &s;ame au|thor) as the fir&s;t-born of all abominati|ons; if it &s;hould be born and brought forth among us, you may call it Gad, and give the &s;ame rea&s;on that Leah did for the name of her &s;on, <HI>Behold a troop cometh,</HI> a troop of all manner of abo|minations.</Q>

<P>The champion of the&s;e &s;entiments was Cotton, who though eminently meek, placid and charitable, yet was &s;trongly tinctured with the prevailing opinion, That the magi&s;trate had a c&ouml;ercive power again&s;t heretics. The bani&s;hment of Ro|ger Williams, mini&s;ter of Salem, occa&s;ion|ed a vehement controver&s;y on this point. Williams having written in favour of li|berty of con&s;cience, and &s;tyled the oppo&s;ite principle "the bloody tenet;" was an|&s;wered by Cotton, who publi&s;hed a treati&s;e in 1647 with this &s;trange title, <Q>The bloody tenet wa&s;hed, and made white in the blood of the Lamb.</Q>
In this work he labours to prove the lawfulne&s;s of the magi&s;trate's u&s;ing the civil &s;word to extir|pate heretics, from the commands given to the Jews to put to death bla&s;phemers and idolaters. To the objection, that per|&s;ecution &s;erves to make men hypocrites, he &s;ays, <Q>better tolerate hypocrites and tares than briars and thorns. In &s;uch ca&s;es the civil &s;word doth not &s;o much attend the conver&s;ion of &s;educers, as the preventing the &s;eduction of hone&s;t minds
<PB N="86" REF="018344_0094_0FA5D64072F14A50">
by their means.</Q>
He allows indeed that <Q>the magi&s;trate ought not to draw the &s;word again&s;t &s;educers till he have u&s;ed all good means for their conviction: But if after their continuance in ob&s;ti|nate rebellion again&s;t the light, he &s;hall &s;till walk toward them in &s;oft and gentle commi&s;eration, his &s;oftne&s;s and gentle|ne&s;s is exce&s;&s;ive large to foxes and wolves; but his bowels are mi&s;erably &s;traitned and hardned again&s;t the poor &s;heep and lambs of Chri&s;t. Nor is it fru&s;trating the end of Chri&s;t's coming, which was to &s;ave &s;ouls, but a direct ad|vancing it, to de&s;troy, if need be, the bodies of tho&s;e wolves, who &s;eek to de|&s;troy the &s;ouls of tho&s;e for whom Chri&s;t died.</Q>
In pur&s;uing his argument he re&s;ines &s;o far as to deny that any man is to be per&s;ecuted on account of con&s;cience <Q>till being convinced in his con&s;cience of his wickedne&s;s, he do &s;tand out therein, not only again&s;t the truth, but again&s;t the light of his own con&s;cience, that &s;o it may appear he is not per&s;ecuted for cau&s;e of con&s;cience, but puni&s;hed for &s;inning again&s;t his own con&s;cience.</Q>
To which he adds, <Q>&s;ometimes it may be an aggravation of &s;in both in judgment and practice that a man committeth it in
<PB N="87" REF="018344_0095_0FA5D64098FF71D0">
con&s;cience.</Q>
After having &s;aid that <Q>it was toleration which made the world antichri&s;tian,</Q>
he concludes his book with this &s;ingular ejaculation, <Q>the Lord keep us from being bewitched with the whore's cup, le&s;t while we &s;eem to reject her with open face of profe&s;&s;ion, we bring her in by a back door of tolerati|on; and &s;o come to drink deeply of the cup of the Lord's wrath, and be filled with her plagues.</Q></P>
<P>But the &s;trange&s;t language that ever was u&s;ed on this or perhaps on any other &s;ubject, is to be found in a book printed in 1645 by the humourous Ward of Ip|&s;wich entitled "the Simple Cobler of A|gawam."
<Q>My heart (&s;ays he) hath naturally dete&s;ted four things; the &s;tand|ing of the Apocrypha in the bible: foreigners dwelling in my country, to croud out native &s;ubjects into the cor|ners of the ea&s;t: alchymized coins: toleration of divers religions or of one religion in &s;egregant &s;hapes. He that willingly a&s;&s;ents to the la&s;t, if he ex|amines his heart by day-light, his con|&s;cience will tell him, he is either an athei&s;t, or an heretic, or an hypocrite, or at be&s;t a captive to &s;ome lu&s;t. Poly|piety is the greate&s;t impiety in the

Mo&s;heim's Eccl. Hi&s;t. vol. 3. p. 261.</P>
<P>"It were indeed ardently to be wi&s;hed, that the LUTHERANS had treated with more mildne&s;s and charity tho&s;e who differed from them in religious opinions. But they had unhappily imbib|ed a &s;pirit of per&s;ecution in their early education. This was too much the &s;pirit of the times, and it was even a leading maxim with our ance&s;tors [this author was a Lutheran] that it was both lawful and expedient to u&s;e &s;everity and force again&s;t tho&s;e whom they looked upon as hereties. <HI>This maxim was derived from ROME;</HI> and even tho&s;e who &s;eparated from that church did not find it ea&s;y to throw off all of a &s;udden that de&s;potic and uncharitable &s;pirit, that had &s;o long been the main &s;pring of its government and the general characteri&s;tic of it members.

<P>"Michael Servetus, a Spani&s;h phy&s;ician, publi&s;hed &s;even books in which he attacked the &s;entiments adopted by far the greate&s;t part of the chri&s;tian church, in relation to the divine nature and a trinity of per&s;ons in the Godhead.

<P>In the reign of Edward the &s;ixth of England, anno 1549, "A woman called Joan Bocher, or Joan of Kent, was accu&s;ed of here|tical pravity.

A &s;chola&s;tic nicety, not capable of doing much mi&s;chief! but there was a nece&s;&s;ity for delivering the woman to the flames for maintaining it. The young king though in &s;uch tender years, had more &s;en&s;e than all his coun&s;ellors and preceptors; and he long refu&s;ed to &s;ign the warrant for her exe|cution. CRANMER, with his &s;uperior learning, was employed to per&s;uade him to compliance, and he &s;aid, that the prince, being God's deputy, ought to repre&s;s impieties again&s;t God, in like man|ner as the king's deputies were bound to puni&s;h offenders again&s;t the king's per&s;on. He al&s;o argued from the practice of the Jewi&s;h church in &s;toning bla&s;phemers. Edward overcome by importunity more than rea&s;on at la&s;t &s;ubmitted, and told Cranmer with tears in his eyes, that if any wrong was done, the guilt &s;hould lie entire|ly on his head. The primate was &s;truck with &s;urprize; but after making a new effort to reclaim the woman and finding her ob&s;ti|nate, he at la&s;t committed her to the flames.

<P>It ought al&s;o to be remembered, that at the &s;ame time that the Quakers &s;uffered in New-England, penal laws again&s;t them were made and rigorou&s;ly executed in England; and though none of them &s;uffered capital executions, yet they were thrown into pri&s;on and treated with other marks of cruelty, which in &s;ome in&s;tances proved the means of their death. And though the lenity of King Charles the IId in putting a &s;top to capital executions here has been much celebrated, yet in his letter to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts government the next year, wherein he requires liberty for the church of Eng|land among them, he adds, <Q>Wee cannot be under&s;tood hereby to direct, or wi&s;h that any indulgence &s;hould be graunted to Quakers, who&s;e principles, being incon&s;i&s;tent with any kind of government, Wee have found it nece&s;&s;ary with the advi&s;e of our parliament here to make a &s;harp law again&s;t them, and are well content you doe the like there.</Q>

The latitude of this place was ob|&s;erved to be 43 degrees 40 minutes and 12 &s;econds, to which three miles being added, made the line of the patent, accord|ing to their con&s;truction, fall within the lake, in the latitude of 43 degrees 43 mi|nutes and 12 &s;econds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1653.</NOTE> Two experienced &s;hip-ma&s;ters, Jonas Clarke and Samuel Andrews, were then di&s;patched to the ea&s;t|ern coa&s;t, who found the &s;ame degrees, minutes, and &s;econds, on the northern point of an i&s;land in Ca&s;co Bay, called the Upper Clapboard I&s;land. An ea&s;t and we&s;tline, drawn through the&s;e points from the Atlantic to the South &s;ea, was there|fore &s;uppo&s;ed to be the northern boundary of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts patent, within which the whole claim of Ma&s;on, and the great|er part of that of Gorges were compre|hended. When this grand point was de|termined, the court were of opinion, that <Q>&s;ome lands at Newichwannock, with the

and they ordered <Q>a quantity of land propor|tionable to his di&s;bur&s;ements, with the privilege of the river, to be laid out to his heirs.</Q>
The agent made no attempt to recover any other part of the e&s;tate; but having tarried long enough in the country to ob&s;erve the temper of the go|vernment, and the management u&s;ed in the determination of his &s;uit, he returned; and the e&s;tate was given up for lo&s;t unle&s;s the government of England &s;hould inter|po&s;e.</P>
<P>During the commonwealth, and the protectorate of Cromwell, there could be no hope of relief, as the family had always been attached to the royal cau&s;e, and the colony &s;tood high in the favor of the par|liament and of Cromwell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1660.</NOTE> But the re&s;to|ration of King Charles the &s;econd encou|raged Tufton, who now took the &s;irname of Ma&s;on, to look up to the throne for fa|vor and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. For though the plan of colonization adopted by his grandfather was in it&s;elf chimerical, and proved fruit|le&s;s, yet he had expended a large e&s;tate in
<PB N="105" REF="018344_0113_0FA5D4BA94323E08">
the pro&s;ecution of it, which mu&s;t have been wholly lo&s;t to his heirs, unle&s;s they could recover the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Ame|rican territories. Full of this idea, Ma&s;on petitioned the king; &s;etting forth <Q>the en|croachment of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts colony upon his lands, their making grants and giving titles to the inhabitants, and there|by di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him and keeping him out of his right.</Q>
The king referred the petition to his attorney-general Sir Geof|fry Palmer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 8. MS in Su. Cour. files.</NOTE> who reported that <Q>Robert Ma&s;on, grand&s;on and heir to Capt. John Ma&s;on, had a good and legal title to the province of New-Hamp&s;hire.</Q>
Nothing farther was done at this time, nor was the matter mentioned in the letter which the king &s;oon after &s;ent to the colony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1662.</NOTE> though &s;ome offen&s;ive things in their conduct were therein reprehended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch.

<P>This commi&s;&s;ion was highly di&s;reli&s;hed by the colony, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the rights and privileges which they enjoyed by their charter, and which the king had &s;acredly promi&s;ed to confirm.

They took the affidavit of Henry Jocelyn concerning the agree|ment

between Governor Cradock and Captain Ma&s;on, that the river &s;hould be the boundary of their re&s;pective patents. They made no determination of this con|trover&s;y in their report to the king; but having called together the inhabitants of Port&s;mouth, Sir Robert Carre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;s. Rec. Octo. 10.</NOTE> in the name of the re&s;t, told them that <Q>they would relea&s;e them from the government of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts who&s;e juri&s;diction &s;hould come no farther than the bound-hou&s;e.</Q>
They then proceeded to appoint ju&s;tices of the peace and other officers, with power to act according to the laws of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. Collection pap. 488.</NOTE> and &s;uch laws of their own as were not repugnant thereto, until the king's plea|&s;ure &s;hould be farther known.</P>
<P>There had always been a party here who were di&s;&s;affected to the government of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. One of the mo&s;t active a|mong them was Abraham Corbett of Port&s;|mouth, who, &s;ince the arrival of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners at Bo&s;ton, and probably by authority derived from them, had taken upon him to i&s;&s;ue warrants in the king's name on &s;everal occa&s;ions, which was con|&s;trued a high mi&s;demeanor, as he had never been commi&s;&s;ioned by the authority of the colony. Being called to account by the general court, he was admoni&s;hed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;&s;a. Rec.</NOTE> fined
<PB N="108" REF="018344_0116_0FA5D4BCD8BC0800">
five pounds, and committed till the &s;en|tence was performed. Irritated by this &s;everity, he was the fitter in&s;trument for the purpo&s;e of the commi&s;&s;ioners, who em|ployed him to frame a petition to the king in the name of the four towns, complain|ing of the u&s;urpation of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts over them, and praying to be relea&s;ed from their tyranny. Corbett, in a &s;ecret manner, procured &s;everal per&s;ons both in Port&s;|mouth and Dover to &s;ub&s;cribe this petition, but the mo&s;t of tho&s;e to whom he offered it refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ible part of the inhabitants now &s;aw with much concern that they were in danger of being reduced to the &s;ame un|happy &s;tate which they had been in before their union with the colony. Awed by the &s;upercilious behaviour of the commi&s;|&s;ioners, they knew not at fir&s;t how to act; for to oppo&s;e the king's authority was con|&s;trued trea&s;on, and it was &s;aid that Sir Robert Carre had threatened a poor old man with death for no other crime than forbidding his grandchild to open a door to them. But when the rumour was &s;pread that a petition was drawn, and that Corbett was procuring &s;ub&s;cribers, the people, no longer able to bear the abu&s;e, earne&s;tly applied to the general court, praying 
<Q><PB N="109" REF="018344_0117_0FA5D4BDAA7FF970">that in &s;ome orderly way they might have an opportunity to clear them&s;elves of &s;o great and unju&s;t a&s;per&s;ions, as were by this petition, drawn in their name, ca&s;t upon the government under which they were &s;ettled; and al&s;o to manife&s;t their &s;en&s;e of &s;uch perfidious actions, le&s;t by their &s;ilence it &s;hould be concluded they were of the &s;ame mind with tho&s;e who framed the petition.</Q>
In con&s;e|quence of this petition, the court commi&s;|&s;ioned Thomas Danforth, Eleazar Lu&s;her, and Major General Leverett to enquire in|to the matter, and &s;ettle the peace in the&s;e places according to their be&s;t di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen came to Port&s;mouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October 9.</NOTE> and having a&s;&s;embled the inhabitants, and publi&s;hed their commi&s;&s;ion, they told them that they were informed of a petition &s;ub|&s;cribed in behalf of that and the neigh|bouring towns, complaining of the go|vernment; and de&s;ired them if they had any ju&s;t grievances to let them be known, and report &s;hould be immediately made to the general court. The next day they a&s;&s;embled the people of Dover and made the &s;ame challenge. Both towns re&s;pec|tively prote&s;ted again&s;t the petition, and profe&s;&s;ed full &s;atisfaction with the govern|ment, which they &s;ignified in addre&s;&s;es to
<PB N="110" REF="018344_0118_0FA5D4C04EE6E930">
the court. Dudley, the mini&s;ter of Exe|ter, certified under his hand to the com|mittee, that the people of that town had no concern directly nor indirectly with the obnoxious petition. They received al&s;o full &s;atisfaction with regard to Hampton; a certificate of which might have been ob|tained, if they had thought it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>They then proceeded to &s;ummon Cor|bett before them for &s;editious behaviour; but he eluded the &s;earch that was made for him, and they were obliged to leave a warrant with an officer to cite him to the court at Bo&s;ton. The commi&s;&s;ioners had now gone over into the province of Maine, from whence Sir Robert Carre in their name &s;ent a &s;evere reprimand to this com|mittee, forbidding them to proceed again&s;t &s;uch per&s;ons as had &s;ub&s;cribed the petition, and inclo&s;ing a copy of a letter which the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners had written to the go|vernor and council on the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The committee returned and reported their proceedings to the court, and about the &s;ame time the commi&s;&s;ioners came from their ea&s;tern tour to Bo&s;ton; where the court de&s;ired a conference with them, but received &s;uch an an&s;wer from Sir Ro|bert Carre as determined them not to re|peat their reque&s;t. A warrant was then
<PB N="111" REF="018344_0119_0FA5D4C1DBC55060">
i&s;&s;ued by the &s;ecretary, in the name of the whole court, to apprehend Corbett and bring him before the governor and ma|gi&s;trates, <Q>to an&s;wer for his tumultuous and &s;editious practices again&s;t the go|vernment.</Q>
The next &s;pring he was &s;eized and brought before them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1666.</NOTE> and af|ter a full hearing was adjudged guilty of &s;edition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 23.</NOTE> and exciting others to di&s;content with the government and laws, and of keeping a di&s;orderly hou&s;e of entertain|ment, for which crimes he was &s;entenced to give a bond of one hundred pounds with &s;ecurity for his peaceable behaviour and obedience to the laws; he was prohi|bited retailing liquors; di&s;abled from bear|ing any office in the town or common|wealth, during the plea&s;ure of the court; and obliged to pay a fine of twenty pounds and five pounds for the co&s;ts of his pro&s;e|cution.</P>
<P>This &s;everity in vindication of their charter-rights they thought fit to temper with &s;omething that had the appearance of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the royal commands. The king's plea&s;ure had been &s;ignified to the commi&s;&s;ioners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. Collect. pap. 419.</NOTE> that the harbours &s;hould be fortified. This in&s;truction came to hand while they were at Pa&s;cataqua, and they immediately i&s;&s;ued warrants to the
<PB N="112" REF="018344_0120_0FA5D4C2BA73DA18">
four towns, requiring them to meet at a time and place appointed to receive his maje&s;ty's orders. One of the&s;e warrants was &s;ent by expre&s;s to Bo&s;ton, from whence two officers were di&s;patched by the governor and council to forbid the towns on their peril to meet, or obey the commands of the commi&s;&s;ioners. But by their own authority they ordered a com|mittee to look out the mo&s;t convenient place for a fortification, upon who&s;e report <Q>the neck of land on the ea&s;tward of the Great I&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;&s;a Rec.</NOTE> where a &s;mall fort had been already built, was &s;eque&s;tered for the purpo&s;e, taking in the Great Rock, and from thence all the ea&s;terly part of the &s;aid i&s;land.</Q>
The court of a&s;&s;ociates being impowered to hear and determine the claims of tho&s;e who pretended any title to this land; a claim was entered by George Walton, but rejected; and the ap|propriation confirmed. The cu&s;toms and impo&s;ts on goods imported into the har|bour were applied to the maintenance of the fort, and the trained bands of Great-I&s;land and Kittery-Point were di&s;charged from all other duty to attend the &s;ervice of it, under Richard Cutts, e&s;q. who was appointed captain.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="018344_0121_0FA5D4C2DFE1ED20">The people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts have, both in former and latter times, been charged with di&s;loyalty to the king in their con|duct toward the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, and their di&s;regard of authority derived from the &s;ame &s;ource with their charter. To ac|count for their conduct on this occa&s;ion, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the ideas they had of their political connexion with the parent &s;tate. They had been forced from thence by per|&s;ecution: they came at their own charges into a wilderne&s;s, claimed indeed by the crown of England; but really in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its native lords; from whom they had purcha&s;ed the &s;oil and &s;overeignty, which gave them a title, con&s;idered in a moral view, &s;uperior to the grant of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y euro|pean prince. For convenience only, they had &s;olicited and accepted a patent from the crown, which in their opinion con&s;tituted the only bond of union between them and their prince, by which the nature and ex|tent of their allegiance to him was to be determined. This patent they regarded as a &s;olemn compact, wherein the king had granted them undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;oil, and power of government within certain limits; on condition that they &s;hould &s;ettle the country, chri&s;|tianize the natives, yield a fifth of all gold

and &s;ilver mines to the crown, and make no laws repugnant to tho&s;e of England. They had, on their part, &s;acredly perform|ed the&s;e conditions; and therefore con|cluded that the grant of title, property and dominion which the crown had made to them was irrevocable. And although they acknowledged them&s;elves &s;ubjects of the reigning prince, and owned a dependence on the royal authority; yet they under|&s;tood it to be only through the medium of their charter.</P>
<P>The appointment of commi&s;&s;ioners who were to act within the &s;ame limits, inde|pendently of this authority, and to receive appeals from it; who&s;e rule of conduct was no e&s;tabli&s;hed law, but their own "good and &s;ound di&s;cretion," was regard|ed as a dangerous &s;tretch of royal power, militating with and &s;uper&s;eding their char|ter. If the royal authority was de&s;tined to flow through the patent, it could not regularly be turned into another channel: if they were to be governed by laws made and executed by officers of their own choo&s;ing, they could not at the &s;ame time be governed by the "di&s;cretion" of men in who&s;e appointment they had no voice, and over whom they had no control.

<P>Remarks on the temper and manners of the Indians. The fir&s;t general war with them called Philip's war.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT the time of the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the river Pa&s;cataqua by Captain Smith, it was found that the native inha|bitants of the&s;e parts differed not in lan|guage, manners, nor government, from their ea&s;tern or we&s;tern neighbours. Though they were divided into &s;everal tribes, each of which had a di&s;tinct &s;achem, yet they all owned &s;ubjection to a &s;overeign prince, called Ba&s;haba,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smith's Voyage.</NOTE> who&s;e re&s;idence was &s;ome|where about Pemaquid. It was &s;oon after found that the Tarratenes, who lived far|ther ea&s;tward, had invaded his country, &s;urprized and &s;lain him, and all the people in his neighbourhood, and carried off his women, leaving no traces of his authority. Upon which the &s;ubordinate &s;achems, hav|ing no head to unite them, and each one &s;triving for the pre-eminence, made war among them&s;elves; whereby many of their people, and much of their provi&s;ion were de&s;troyed. When Sir Richard Haw|kins vi&s;ited the coa&s;t in 1615,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gorges's N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rat. p. 17.54.</NOTE> this war was

at its height; and to this &s;ucceeded a pe|&s;tilence, which carried them off in &s;uch numbers that the living were not able to bury the dead;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince's Annals. 1617.</NOTE> but their bones remained at the places of their habitations for &s;everal years. During this pe&s;tilence, Richard Vines and &s;everal others, whom Sir Fer|dinando Gorges had hired, at a great ex|pence, to tarry in the country through the winter, lived among them and lodged in their cabbins, without receiving the lea&s;t injury in their health,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gorges, p. 12.</NOTE>
<Q>not &s;o much as feeling their heads to ach the whole time.</Q>
By &s;uch &s;ingular means did di|vine providence prepare the way for the peaceable entrance of the Europeans into this land.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t &s;ettlements were made, the remains of two tribes had their habi|tations on the &s;everal branches of the river Pa&s;cataqua; one of their &s;achems lived at the falls of Squam&s;cot, and the other at tho&s;e of Newichwannock; their head quar|ters being generally &s;eated in places con|venient for fi&s;hing. Both the&s;e, together with &s;everal inland tribes, who re&s;ided at Pantucket and Winnipi&s;eogee, acknow|ledged &s;ubjection to Pa&s;&s;aconaway the great &s;agamore of Pannukog, or (as it is com|monly pronounced) Pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cook.

They believed that it was in his power to make water burn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. Hi&s;t. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t.

<P>An Engli&s;h gentleman who had been much conver&s;ant among the Indians was invited, in 1660, to a great dance and fea&s;t; on which occa&s;ion the elderly men, in &s;ongs or &s;peeches recite their hi&s;tories, and deli|ver their &s;entiments, and advice, to the younger. At this &s;olemnity Pa&s;&s;aconaway, being grown old, made his farewell &s;peech to his children and people; in which, as a dying man, he warned them to take heed how they quarrelled with their Engli&s;h neighbours; for though they might do them &s;ome damage, yet it would prove the means of their own de&s;truction. He told them that he had been a bitter enemy to the Engli&s;h, and by the arts of &s;orcery had tried his utmo&s;t to hinder

This caution perhaps often repeated, had &s;uch an effect, that upon the breaking out of the Indian war fifteen years afterward, Wonolan&s;et,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's printed Narrative. p. 9.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1.</NOTE> his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, withdrew him&s;elf and his people into &s;ome remote place, that they might not be drawn into the quarrel.</P>
<P>While the Briti&s;h nations had been di&s;|tracted with internal convul&s;ions, and had endured the horrors of a civil war, pro|duced by the &s;ame cau&s;es which forced the planters of New-England to quit the land of their nativity; this wilderne&s;s had been to them a quiet habitation. They had &s;truggled with many hard&s;hips; but pro|vidence had &s;miled upon their undertak|ing, their &s;ettlements were extended and their churches multiplied. There had been no remarkable quarrel with the &s;avages, except the &s;hort war with the Pequods, who dwelt in the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of Con|necticut: They being totally &s;ubdued in 1637, the dread and terror of the Engli&s;h kept the other nations quiet for near forty years. During which time the New-England colonies being confederated for their mutual defence, and for maintaining the public peace, took great pains to pro|pagate the go&s;pel among the natives, and

bring them to a civilized way of living, which, with re&s;pect to &s;ome, proved ef|fectual; others refu&s;ed to receive the mi&s;|&s;ionaries, and remained ob&s;tinately preju|diced again&s;t the Engli&s;h. Yet the object of their hatred was at the &s;ame time the object of their fear; which led them to forbear acts of ho&s;tility, and to pre&s;erve an outward &s;hew of friend&s;hip, to their mutual intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Our hi&s;torians have generally repre&s;ent|ed the Indians in a mo&s;t odious light, e&s;pecially when recounting the effects of their ferocity. Dogs, caitiffs, mi&s;creants and hell-hounds, are the polite&s;t names which have been given them by &s;ome wri|ters, who &s;eem to be in a pa&s;&s;ion at the mentioning their cruelties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's Narrative and Mather's Magnalia.</NOTE> and at other times &s;peak of them with contempt. What|ever indulgence may be allowed to tho&s;e who wrote in times when the mind was vexed with their recent depredations and inhumanities, it ill becomes us to cheri&s;h an inveterate hatred of the unhappy na|tives. Religion teaches us a better tem|per, and providence has now put an end to the controver&s;y, by their almo&s;t total extirpation. We &s;hould therefore proceed with calmne&s;s in recollecting their pa&s;t in|juries, and forming our judgment of their character.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="018344_0133_0FA5D4CE15793528">It mu&s;t be acknowledged that human depravity appeared in the&s;e unhappy crea|tures in a mo&s;t &s;hocking view.

Yet, bad as they were, it will be difficult to find them guilty of any crime which cannot be pa|ralleled among civilized nations.</P>
<P>They are always de&s;cribed as remarka|bly <HI>cruel;</HI> and it cannot be denied that this di&s;po&s;ition indulged to the greate&s;t ex|ce&s;s, &s;trongly marks their character.

But is it not as dreadful to read of an unhappy wretch, &s;ewed up in a &s;ack full of &s;erpents and thrown into the &s;ea, or broiled in a red hot iron chair; or mangled by lions and tygers after having &s;pent his &s;trength to combat them for the di|ver&s;ion

<P>Notwith&s;tanding this general opinion, it may admit of &s;ome doubt, whether a &s;ingle &s;achem, who&s;e authority was limit|ed, could have &s;uch an exten&s;ive influence over tribes &s;o remote and unconnected with him as the ea&s;tern Indians; much more improbable is it, that tho&s;e in Virginia &s;hould have joined in the confederacy, as it hath been intimated.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's Narrative, p. 12.</NOTE> The Indians ne|ver travelled to any greater di&s;tance than their hunting required; and &s;o ignorant were they of the geography of their coun|try,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neal's Hi&s;t.

in time, e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves and extirpate the Indians, &s;o he thought that the mak|ing war upon them would only ha&s;ten the de&s;truction of his own people. It was al|ways a very common, and &s;ometimes a ju&s;t excu&s;e with the Indians, when charg|ed with breach of faith, that the old men were not able to re&s;train the younger from &s;ignalizing their valour, and gratifying their revenge, though they di&s;approved their ra&s;hne&s;s. This want of re&s;traint was owing to the weakne&s;s of their govern|ment; their &s;achems having but the &s;ha|dow of magi&s;tratical authority.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Bri&s;tol &s;hew a parti|cular &s;pot where Philip received the news of the fir&s;t Engli&s;hmen that were killed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Callendar's Century Sermon, p. 73.</NOTE> with &s;o much &s;orrow as to cau&s;e him to weep; a few days before which he had re&s;cued one who had been taken by his Indians, and privately &s;ent him home. Whatever credit may be given to this ac|count, &s;o different from the current opi|nion, it mu&s;t be owned, that in &s;uch a &s;ea|&s;on of general confu&s;ion as the fir&s;t war occa&s;ioned, fear and jealou&s;y might create many &s;u&s;picions, which would &s;oon be formed into reports of a general confede|racy, through Philip's contrivance; and it is to be noted that the principal hi&s;tories

of this war, [Increa&s;e Mather's and Hub|bard's] were printed in 1676 and 1677, when the &s;trange&s;t reports were ea&s;ily cre|dited, and the people were ready to be|lieve every thing that was bad of &s;o formi|dable a neighbour as Philip.

<P>There dwelled near the river Saco a &s;a|chem named Squando, a noted enthu&s;ia&s;t, a leader in the devotions of their religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard, p. 29.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1.</NOTE> and one that pretended to a familiar inter|cour&s;e with the invi&s;ible world.

His &s;quaw pa&s;&s;ing along the river in a canoe, with her infant child, was met by &s;ome rude &s;ailors, who having heard that the Indian children could &s;wim as naturally as the young of the brutal kind, in a thought|le&s;s and unguarded humour over&s;et the canoe.

<P>The fir&s;t alarm of the war in Plymouth colony &s;pread great con&s;ternation among the di&s;tant Indians, and held them a while in &s;u&s;pence what part to act; for there had been a long external friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them and the Engli&s;h, and they were afraid of provoking &s;o powerful neighbours. But the &s;eeds of jealou&s;y and hatred had been &s;o effectually &s;own, that the crafty and revengeful, and tho&s;e who were ambitious of doing &s;ome exploits, &s;oon found means to urge them on to an open rupture; &s;o that within twenty days after Philip had begun the war at the &s;outhward, the flame broke out in the mo&s;t northea&s;terly part of the country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard, p. 13.</NOTE> at the di&s;tance of two hundred miles.</P>

The men were at &s;uch a di&s;tance from their fellows that they could make no &s;ignal to them without danger of a di&s;covery; two of them, therefore, crept along &s;ilently, near to the hou&s;e, from whence they &s;ud|denly ru&s;hed upon tho&s;e two Indians, who were bu&s;y at the fire, and knocked them down with the butts of their guns; the other three took the alarm and e&s;caped.</P>

The only way was to de&s;ert their ha|bitations, and retire together within the larger and more convenient hou&s;es, which they fortified with a timber wall and flank|arts, placing a centry-box on the roof. Thus the labour of the field was exchang|ed for the duty of the garri&s;on, and they who had long lived in peace and &s;ecurity were upon their guard night and day, &s;ub|ject to continual alarms, and the mo&s;t fear|ful apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh of October was ob&s;erved as a day of fa&s;ting and prayer; and on the &s;ixteenth the enemy made an a&s;&s;ault upon the inhabitants at Salmon falls, in Berwick.

The gallant behaviour of Plai&s;ted, though fatal to him&s;elf and his &s;ons, had this good effect, that the enemy retreated to the woods; and the next day Captain Fro&s;t came up with a party from Sturgeon creek, and peaceably buried the dead:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard, p. 24.</NOTE> But be|fore the month had expired a mill was burned there, and an a&s;&s;ault made on Fro&s;t's garri&s;on, who though he had only three boys with him, kept up a con&s;tant fire, and called aloud as if he were commanding a body of men, to march here and fire there: the &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded, and the hou&s;e was &s;aved. The enemy then proceeded down the river, killing and plundering as they

<P>The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts government being fully employed in defending the &s;outhern and we&s;tern parts, could not &s;ea&s;onably &s;end &s;uccours to the ea&s;tward. Major General Deni&s;on, who commanded the mi|litia of the colony, had ordered the majors who commanded the regiments on this &s;ide of the country, to draw out a &s;ufficient number of men to reduce the enemy, by attacking them at their retreat to their head-quarters at O&s;&s;apy and Pigwacket. But the winter &s;etting in early and fiercely, and the men being unprovided with rack|ets to travel on the &s;now, which by the tenth of December was four feet deep in
<PB N="140" REF="018344_0148_0FA5D4DD140DA2F0">
the woods, it was impo&s;&s;ible to execute the de&s;ign. This peculiar &s;everity of the &s;ea|&s;on however proved favourable. The In|dians were pinched with famine, and hav|ing lo&s;t by their own confe&s;&s;ion about ninety of their number, partly by the war, and partly for want of food, they were re|duced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uing for peace. With this view they came to Major Wal|dron, expre&s;&s;ing great &s;orrow for what had been done, and promi&s;ing to be quiet and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive. By his mediation a peace was concluded with the whole body of ea&s;tern Indians, which continued till the next Au|gu&s;t; and might have continued longer, if the inhabitants of the ea&s;tern parts had not been too intent on private gain, and of a di&s;po&s;ition too ungovernable to be a barrier again&s;t an enemy &s;o irritable and vindictive. The re&s;toration of the captives made the peace more plea&s;ant: A return from the dead could not be more welcome than a deliverance from Indian captivity.</P>
<P>The war at the &s;outhward, though re|newed in the &s;pring,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1676.</NOTE> drew toward a clo&s;e.

the war, now fearing a total extirpation, endeavoured to conceal them&s;elves among their brethren of Penacook who had not joined in the war, and with tho&s;e of O&s;&s;apy and Pigwacket who had made peace. But they could not &s;o di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves or their behaviour as to e&s;cape the di&s;cern|ment of tho&s;e who had been conver&s;ant with Indians. Several of them were taken at different times and delivered up to pub|lic execution. Three of them, Simon, Andrew and Peter, who had been concern|ed in killing Thomas Kimbal of Bradford, and captivating his family, did, within &s;ix weeks voluntarily re&s;tore the woman and five children. It being doubted whether this act of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was a &s;ufficient atone|ment for the murder, they were commit|ted to Dover pri&s;on till their ca&s;e could be con&s;idered. Fearing that this confinement was a prelude to farther puni&s;hment, they broke out of pri&s;on, and going to the ea&s;t|ward, joined with the Indians of Kenne|beck and Amori&s;cogin in tho&s;e depreda|tions which they renewed on the inhabi|tants of tho&s;e parts, in Augu&s;t, and were afterward active in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the people at Pa&s;cataqua.</P>
<P>This renewal of ho&s;tilities occa&s;ioned the &s;ending of two companies to the ea&s;tward
<PB N="142" REF="018344_0150_0FA5D4DEA2F134A8">
under Captain Jo&s;eph Syll, and Captain William Hawthorne. In the cour&s;e of their march they came to Cocheclio, on the &s;ixth of September, where four hun|dred mixed Indians were met at the hou&s;e of Major Waldron, with whom they had made the peace, and whom they con&s;ider|ed as their friend and father. The two captains would have fallen upon them at once, having it in their orders to &s;eize all Indians, who had been concerned in the war. The major di&s;&s;uaded them from that purpo&s;e, and contrived the following &s;tra|tagem. He propo&s;ed to the Indians, to have a training the next day, and a &s;ham fight after the Engli&s;h mode; and &s;um|moning his own men, with tho&s;e under Captain Fro&s;t of Kittery, they, in conjunc|tion with the two companies, formed one party, and the Indians another. Having diverted them a while in this manner, and cau&s;ed the Indians to fire the fir&s;t volley; by a peculiar dexterity, the whole body of them (except two or three) were &s;ur|rounded, before they could form a &s;u&s;pi|cion of what was intended. They were immediately &s;eized and di&s;armed, without the lo&s;s of a man on either &s;ide. A &s;epa|ration was then made: Wonolan&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, with the Penacook Indians, and others who
<PB N="143" REF="018344_0151_0FA5D4E119ECA860">

<P>This action was highly applauded by the general voice of the colony; as it gave them opportunity to deal with their ene|mies in a judicial way, as rebels, and, as they imagined, to extirpate tho&s;e trouble|&s;ome neighbours. The remaining Indi|ans, however, looked upon the conduct of Major Waldron as a breach of faith; ina&s;|much as they had taken tho&s;e fugitive In|dians under their protection, and had made peace with him, which had been &s;trictly ob&s;erved with regard to him and his neighbours, though it had been broken el&s;ewhere. The Indians had no idea of the &s;ame government being extended very far, and thought they might make peace in one place, and war in another, without any imputation of infidelity; but a breach of ho&s;pitality and friend&s;hip, as they deem|ed
<PB N="144" REF="018344_0152_0FA5D4E1E5E9E308">
this to be, merited, according to their principles, a &s;evere revenge, and was never to be forgotten or forgiven. The major's &s;ituation on this occa&s;ion was indeed ex|tremely critical; and he could not have acted either way without blame. It is &s;aid that his own judgment was again&s;t any forcible mea&s;ure, as he knew that many of tho&s;e Indians were true friends to the colony; and that in ca&s;e of failure he &s;hould expo&s;e the country to their re|&s;entment; but had he not a&s;&s;i&s;ted the forces in the execution of their commi&s;&s;ion, (which was to &s;eize all Indians who had been con|cerned with Philip in the war) he mu&s;t have fallen under cen&s;ure, and been deemed acce&s;&s;ary, by his neglect, to the mi&s;chiefs which might afterward have been perpe|trated by them. In this dilemma he finally determined to comply with the orders and expectations of government; imagining that he &s;hould be able to &s;atisfy tho&s;e of the Indians whom he intended to di&s;mi&s;s, and that the others would be removed out of the way of doing any further mi&s;|chief; but he had no &s;u&s;picion that he was laying a &s;nare for his own life. It was unhappy for him, that he was obliged in deference to the laws of his country, and the orders of government, to give offence
<PB N="145" REF="018344_0153_0FA5D4E2A3E12670">
to a people who, having no public judica|tories and penal laws among them&s;elves, were unable to di&s;tingui&s;h between a legal puni&s;hment and private malice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The above account of the &s;eizure of the Indians is given from the mo&s;t authentic and credible tradition that could be obtained within the la&s;t &s;ixteen years, from the po&s;terity of tho&s;e per&s;ons who were concerned in the affair.

<P>Two days after this &s;urpri&s;al the forces proceeded on their route to the ea&s;tward, being joined with &s;ome of Waldron's and Fro&s;t's men; and taking with them Blind Will, a &s;agamore of the Indians who lived about Cochecho, and eight of his people for pilots. The ea&s;tern &s;ettlements were all either de&s;troyed or de&s;erted, and no enemy was to be &s;een; &s;o that the expe|dition proved fruitle&s;s, and the companies returned to Pa&s;cataqua.</P>
<P>It was then thought advi&s;eable, that they &s;hould march up toward the O&s;&s;apy ponds; where the Indians had a &s;trong fort of timber fourteen feet high, with flankarts; which they had a few years before hired &s;ome Engli&s;h carpenters to build for them, as a defence again&s;t the Mohawks, of whom they were always afraid. It was thought that if the Indians could be &s;urprized on their fir&s;t return to their head-quarters, at
<PB N="146" REF="018344_0154_0FA5D4E3140E23D8">
the beginning of winter, &s;ome con&s;iderable advantage might be gained again&s;t them; or if they had not arrived there, that the provi&s;ions, which they had laid in for their winter &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, might be de&s;troyed. Accordingly, the companies being well provided for a march at that &s;ea&s;on, &s;et off on the fir&s;t of November; and after tra|velling four days through a rugged, moun|tainous wilderne&s;s, and cro&s;&s;ing &s;everal rivers, they arrived at the &s;pot; but found the fort and adjacent places entirely de|&s;erted, and &s;aw not an Indian in all the way. Thinking it needle&s;s for the whole body to go further, the weather being &s;e|vere, and the &s;now deep, a &s;elect party was detached eighteen or twenty miles above; who di&s;covered nothing but frozen ponds, and &s;nowy mountains; and &s;uppo&s;ing the Indians had taken up their winter quarters nearer the &s;ea, they returned to Newich|wannock, within nine days from their fir&s;t departure.</P>
<P>They had been prompted to undertake this expedition by the fal&s;e accounts brought by Mogg, an Indian of Penob&s;cot, who had come in to Pa&s;cataqua, with a propo&s;al of peace; and had reported that an hundred Indians were a&s;&s;embled at O&s;&s;apy. This Indian brought with him two men of
<PB N="147" REF="018344_0155_0FA5D4E3E97937D0">
Port&s;mouth, Fryer and Kendal, who had been taken on board a ve&s;&s;el at the ea&s;t|ward; he was deputed by the Penob&s;cot tribe to con&s;ent to articles of pacification; and being &s;ent to Bo&s;ton, a treaty was drawn and &s;ub&s;cribed by the governor and magi&s;trates on the one part, and by Mogg on the other; in which it was &s;tipulated, that if the Indians of the other tribes did not agree to this tran&s;action, and cea&s;e ho|&s;tilities, they &s;hould be deemed and treat|ed as enemies by both parties. This treaty was &s;igned on the &s;ixth of November; Mogg pledging his life for the fulfilment of it. Accordingly, ve&s;&s;els being &s;ent to Penob&s;cot, the peace was ratified by Mado|kawando the &s;achem, and two captives were re&s;tored. But Mogg, being incau|tiou&s;ly permitted to go to a neighbouring tribe, on pretence of per&s;uading them to deliver their captives, though he promi&s;ed to return in three days, was &s;een no more. It was at fir&s;t thought that he had been &s;acrificed by his countrymen, as he pre|tended to fear when he left the ve&s;&s;els;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1677.</NOTE> but a captive who e&s;caped in January gave a different account of him; that he boa&s;t|ed of having deceived the Engli&s;h, and laughed at their kind entertainment of him. There was al&s;o a de&s;ign talked of among
<PB N="148" REF="018344_0156_0FA5D4E49E01EE38">
them to break the peace in the &s;pring, and join with the other Indians at the ea&s;tward in ruining the fi&s;hery. About the &s;ame time it was di&s;covered that &s;ome of the Narrhagan&s;et Indians were &s;cattered in the ea&s;tern parts; three of them having been decoyed by &s;ome of the Cochecho Indians into their wigwams, and &s;calped, were known by the cut of their hair. This rai&s;ed a fear in the minds of the people, that more of them might have found their way to the ea&s;tward, and would pro&s;ecute their revenge again&s;t them.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances it was &s;u&s;pec|ted, that the truce would be but of &s;hort continuance. The treachery of Mogg, who was &s;urety for the performance of the treaty, was deemed a full ju&s;tification of the renewal of ho&s;tilities; and the &s;tate of things was, by &s;ome gentlemen of Pa&s;|cataqua, repre&s;ented to be &s;o dangerous, that the government determined upon a winter expedition. Two hundred men, including &s;ixty Natick Indians, were en|li&s;ted and equipped, and &s;ailed from Bo&s;ton the fir&s;t week in February, under the com|mand of Major Waldron; a day of prayer having been previou&s;ly appointed for the &s;ucce&s;s of the enterprize.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="018344_0157_0FA5D4E55F321968">At Ca&s;co the major had a fruitle&s;s con|ference, and a &s;light &s;kirmi&s;h with a few Indians, of whom &s;ome were killed and wounded. At Kennebeck he built a fort, and left a garri&s;on of forty men, under the command of Captain Sylvanus Davis. At Pemaquid he had a conference with a com|pany of Indians, who promi&s;ed to deliver their captives on the payment of a ran&s;om: Part of it being paid, three captives were delivered, and it was agreed that the con|ference &s;hould be renewed in the after|noon, and all arms be laid a&s;ide. Some &s;u&s;picion of their infidelity had ari&s;en, and when the major went a&s;hore in the after|noon with five men, and the remainder of the ran&s;om, he di&s;covered the point of a lance hid under a board, which he drew out and advanced with it toward them; charging them with treachery in conceal|ing their arms &s;o near. They attempted to take it from him by force; but he threatened them with in&s;tant death, and waved his cap for a &s;ignal to the ve&s;&s;els. While the re&s;t were coming on &s;hore, the major with his five men &s;ecured the goods: Some of the Indians &s;natching up a bun|dle of guns which they had hid, ran away: Captain Fro&s;t, who was one of the five, &s;eized an Indian, who was well known to
<PB N="150" REF="018344_0158_0FA5D4E612C52530">
be a rogue, and with Lieutenant Nutter, carried him on board. The major &s;earch|ing about found three guns, with which he armed his remaining three men; and the re&s;t being come on &s;hore by this time, they pur&s;ued the Indians, killed &s;everal of them before they could recover their ca|noes, and after they had pu&s;hed off, &s;unk one with five men, who were drowned; and took four pri&s;oners, with about a thou|&s;and pounds of dried beef, and &s;ome other plunder. The whole number of the In|dians was twenty-five.</P>
<P>Whether the ca&s;ual di&s;covery of their arms, which they had agreed to lay a&s;ide, was &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify this &s;everity, may be doubted; &s;ince, if their intentions had really been ho&s;tile, they had a fine oppor|tunity of ambu&s;hing or &s;eizing the major and his five attendants, who came a&s;hore unarmed; and it is not likely that they would have waited for the re&s;t to come a&s;hore before they opened the plot. Po&s;&s;i|bly, this &s;udden &s;u&s;picion might be ground|le&s;s, and might inflame the prejudice again&s;t the major, which had been already excited by the &s;eizure of their friends at Cochecho &s;ome time before.</P>
<P>On the return of the forces, they found &s;ome wheat, guns, anchors and boards at

They killed two Indians on Arrow&s;ick I&s;land, who, with one of the pri&s;oners taken at Pemaquid, and &s;hot on board, made the number of Indians killed in this expedition thirteen.

<P>There being no pro&s;pect of peace at the ea&s;tward, it became nece&s;&s;ary to maintain great circum&s;pection and re&s;olution, and to make u&s;e of every po&s;&s;ible advantage again&s;t the enemy. A long and invete|rate animo&s;ity had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Mohawks and the ea&s;tern Indians, the original of which is not mentioned, and perhaps was not known by any of our hi&s;torians; nor can the olde&s;t men among the Mohawks at this day give any account of it. The&s;e Indians were in a &s;tate of friend&s;hip with their Engli&s;h neighbours; and being a fierce and formidable race of men, their name carried terror wherever

it was known. It was now thought, that if they could be induced to pro&s;ecute their ancient quarrel with the ea&s;tern Indians, the latter might be awed into peace, or incapacitated for any farther mi&s;chief. The propriety of this mea&s;ure became a &s;ubject of debate; &s;ome que&s;tioning the lawfulne&s;s of making u&s;e of their help, "as they were heathen;" but it was urged in reply, that Abraham had entered into a confederacy with the Amorites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gene&s;is, ch. 14.</NOTE> among whom he dwelled, and made u&s;e of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in recovering his kin&s;man Lot from the hands of their common enemy. With this argument the objectors were &s;atisfied; and the two me&s;&s;engers, Major Pynchon of Springfield, and Richards of Hartford were di&s;patched to the country of the Mohawks; who treated them with great civility, expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t bitter hatred again&s;t the ea&s;tern enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's MS Hi&s;to|ry.</NOTE> and promi&s;ed to pur&s;ue the quarrel to the ut|mo&s;t of their power.</P>
<P>Accordingly &s;ome parties of them came down the country about the middle of March, and the fir&s;t alarm was given at Amu&s;keeg falls; where the &s;on of Wono|lan&s;et being hunting, di&s;covered fifteen Indians on the other &s;ide, who called to him in a language which he did not un|der&s;tand;

grew jealous of their &s;incerity, and ima|gined, not without very plau&s;ible ground, that the Mohawks had been per&s;uaded or hired to engage in the war, on purpo&s;e to de&s;troy them; &s;ince they never actually exerci&s;ed their fury upon tho&s;e Indians who were in ho&s;tility with the Engli&s;h, but only upon tho&s;e who were in friend|&s;hip with them; and this only in &s;uch a degree as to irritate, rather than to weak|en or di&s;tre&s;s them.

<P>It was a matter of great enquiry and &s;peculation how the Indians were &s;upplied with arms and ammunition to carry on this war.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hubbard's printed Narrative, p. 82.</NOTE> The Dutch at New-York were too near the Mohawks for the ea&s;tern In|dians to adventure thither.

It was therefore &s;uppo&s;ed that the Indians had long premeditated the war, and laid in a &s;tock beforehand. There had for|merly been &s;evere penalties exacted by the government, on the &s;elling of arms and ammunition to the Indians; but ever
<PB N="160" REF="018344_0168_0FA5D4F1B2927CC8">
&s;ince 1657, licences had been granted to particular per&s;ons to &s;upply them occa&s;ion|ally for the purpo&s;e of hunting, on pay|ing an acknowledgment to the public trea|&s;ury. This indulgence, having been much abu&s;ed by &s;ome of the ea&s;tern traders, who, far from the &s;eat of government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ran|dolph's Narrative in Hutch. col. papers, p. 492.</NOTE> were im|patient of the re&s;traint of law, was &s;up|po&s;ed to be the &s;ource of the mi&s;chief. But it was afterward di&s;covered that the Baron de St. Ca&s;tine, a reduced French of|ficer, who had married a daughter of Ma|dokawando, and kept a trading hou&s;e at Penob&s;cot, where he con&s;idered him&s;elf as independent, being out of the limits of any e&s;tabli&s;hed government, was the per&s;on from whom they had their &s;upplies; which needed not to be very great as they always hu&s;banded their ammunition with much care,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid, p. 562.</NOTE> and never expended it but when they were certain of doing execution.</P>
<P>The whole burden and expence of this war, on the part of the colonies, were borne by them&s;elves. It was indeed thought &s;trange by their friends in England, and re&s;ented by tho&s;e in power, that they made no ap|plication to the king for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It was intimated to them by Lord Angle&s;ey <Q>that his maje&s;ty was ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with &s;hips,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. p. 309.</NOTE> troops, ammunition or money, if

and their &s;ilence was con&s;trued to their di&s;advantage, as if they were proud, and ob&s;tinate, and de|&s;ired to be con&s;idered as an independent &s;tate. They had indeed no inclination to a&s;k favours from thence; being well aware of the con&s;equence of laying them&s;elves under obligations to tho&s;e who had been &s;eeking to undermine their e&s;tabli&s;hment; and remembering how they had been ne|glected in the late Dutch wars, when they &s;tood in much greater need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance: The king had then &s;ent ammunition to New-York, but had &s;ent word to New-England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. col. pap. p. 506.</NOTE>
<Q>that they mu&s;t &s;hift for them|&s;elves and make the be&s;t defence they could.</Q>
It was therefore highly injuri|ous to blame them for not making ap|plication for help. But if they had not been &s;o ill treated, they could not be charg|ed with di&s;re&s;pect, &s;ince they really did not need foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Ships of war and regular troops mu&s;t have been altogether u&s;ele&s;s; and no one that knew the nature of an Indian war could be &s;erious in pro|po&s;ing to &s;end them. Ammunition and money were nece&s;&s;ary, but as they had long enjoyed a free trade, and had coined the bullion which they imported, there was no &s;carcity of money, nor of any &s;tores
<PB N="162" REF="018344_0170_0FA5D4F4070D2530">
which money could purcha&s;e. The me|thod of fighting with Indians could be learned only from them&s;elves: After a little experience, few men in &s;cattered parties were of more &s;ervice than the large&s;t and be&s;t equipped armies which Europe could have afforded. It ought ever to be remembered for the honor of New-Eng|land, that as their fir&s;t &s;ettlement, &s;o their pre&s;ervation, increa&s;e, and defence, even in their weake&s;t infancy were not owing to any foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but under God, to their own magnanimity and per&s;eve|rance.</P>
<P>Our grave&s;t hi&s;torians have recorded many omens, predictions, and other alarm|ing circum&s;tances, during this and the Pe|quod war, which in a more philo&s;ophical and le&s;s credulous age would not be wor|thy of notice. When men's minds were rendered gloomy by the horrors of a &s;ur|rounding wilderne&s;s, and the continual apprehen&s;ion of danger from its &s;avage in|habitants; when they were ignorant of the cau&s;es of many of the common ap|pearances in nature, and were di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;olve every unu&s;ual appearance into pro|digy and miracle, it is not to be wonder|ed that they &s;hould imagine they heard the noi&s;e of drums and guns in the air,

and &s;aw flaming &s;words and &s;pears in the heavens, and &s;hould even interpret eclip&s;es as ominous. Some old Indians had inti|mated their apprehen&s;ions concerning the increa&s;e of the Engli&s;h, and the diminu|tion of their own people, which any rati|onal ob&s;erver in a cour&s;e of forty or fifty years might ea&s;ily have foretold, without the lea&s;t pretence to a &s;pirit of prophecy; yet the&s;e &s;ayings were recollected, and re|corded, as &s;o many predictions by force of a &s;upernatural impul&s;e on their minds, and many per&s;ons of the greate&s;t di&s;tinction were di&s;po&s;ed to credit them as &s;uch.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1675.</NOTE>WHILE the country was labouring under the perplexity and di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;ing from the war, mea&s;ures were taking in England to increa&s;e their difficulties and divide their attention. The &s;cheme of &s;elling the provinces of New-Hamp&s;hire and Maine to the crown being laid a&s;ide, Ma&s;on again petitioned the king for the re&s;toration of his property; and the king referred the matter to his attorney general Sir William Jones, and his &s;olicitor general Sir Francis Winnington, who reported that <Q>John Ma&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 17.</NOTE> e&s;q. grandfather to the pe|titioner, by virtue of &s;everal grants from the council of New-England under their common &s;eal was in&s;tated in fee in &s;un|dry great tracts of land in New-England, by the name of New-Hamp&s;hire;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Copy in Superior Court files.</NOTE> and that the petitioner being heir at law to the &s;aid John had a good and legal title

to &s;aid lands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1676.</NOTE></Q>
Whereupon a letter was di&s;patched to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts colony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 10.</NOTE> requiring them to &s;end over agents with|in &s;ix months, fully impowered to an&s;wer the complaints, which Ma&s;on and the heirs of Gorges had made, of their u&s;urping juri&s;diction over the territories claimed by them; and to receive the royal determi|nation in that matter. Copies of the com|plaints were inclo&s;ed; and Edward Ran|dolph, a kin&s;man of Ma&s;on, a man of great addre&s;s and penetration, re&s;olute and in|defatigable in bu&s;ine&s;s, was charged with the letters, and directed by the Lords of Trade to make enquiry into the &s;tate of the country. When he arrived,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 10.</NOTE> he waited on Governor Leverett, who read the king's letter with the petitions of Ma&s;on and Gorges in council, Randolph being pre|&s;ent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. col. pap. p. 504.</NOTE> who could obtain no other an&s;wer than that "they would con&s;ider it."</P>
<P>He then came into New-Hamp&s;hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> and as he pa&s;&s;ed along, freely declared the bu&s;ine&s;s on which he was come, and pub|licly read a letter which Ma&s;on had &s;ent to the inhabitants. Some of them he found ready to complain of the government, and de&s;irous of a change; but the body of the people were highly enraged again&s;t him; and the inhabitants of Dover in public

town-meeting <Q>prote&s;ted again&s;t the claim of Ma&s;on; declared that they had bon&acirc;+fide purcha&s;ed their lands of the Indians; recognized their &s;ubjection to the go|vernment of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, under whom they had lived long and happily, and by whom they were now a&s;&s;i&s;ted in defend|ing their e&s;tates and families again&s;t the &s;avage enemy.</Q>
They appointed Major Waldron <Q>to petition the king in their behalf, that he would interpo&s;e his royal authority and afford them his wonted favor; that they might not be di&s;turb|ed by Ma&s;on, or any other per&s;on, but continue peaceably in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their rights under the government of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dover Re|cords.</NOTE></Q>
A &s;imilar petition was &s;ent by the inhabitants of Port&s;mouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Port&s;mou. Records, Sept. 1.</NOTE> who ap|pointed John Cutts and Richard Martyn, e&s;qrs. Captains Daniel and Stileman to draught and forward it.</P>
<P>When Randolph returned to Bo&s;ton, he had a &s;evere reproof from the governor, for publi&s;hing his errand, and endeavour|ing to rai&s;e di&s;content among the people. To which he made no other an&s;wer than that <Q>if he had done ami&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. col. pap. p. 510.</NOTE> they might complain to the king.</Q></P>
<P>After about &s;ix weeks &s;lay, he went back to England and reported to the king, that <Q><PB N="167" REF="018344_0175_0FA5D4F771FEF340">he had found the whole country com|plaining of the u&s;urpation of the magi|&s;trates of Bo&s;ton; earne&s;tly hoping and expecting that his maje&s;ty would not permit them any longer to be oppre&s;&s;ed; but would give them relief according to the promi&s;es of the commi&s;&s;ioners in 1665.</Q>
With the &s;ame bitterne&s;s of temper, and in the &s;ame &s;train of mi&s;re|pre&s;entation, he inveighed again&s;t the go|vernment in a long report to the Lords of Trade; which farther inflamed the pre|judice that had long been conceived again&s;t the colony, and prepared the way for the &s;eparation which was meditated.</P>
<P>After his departure, a &s;pecial council being &s;ummoned, at which the elders of the churches were pre&s;ent, the que&s;tion was propo&s;ed to them <Q>whether the be&s;t way of making an&s;wer to the complaints of Gorges and Ma&s;on about the extent of their patent, be by &s;ending agents, or by writing only?</Q>
To which they an&s;wered, <Q>That it was mo&s;t expedient to &s;end agents, to an&s;wer by way of in|formation, provided they were in&s;truct|ed with much care and caution to nego|ciate the affair with &s;afety to the coun|try, and loyalty to his maje&s;ty, in the pre&s;ervation of their patent liberties.</Q>

<P>The form of government de&s;cribed in this commi&s;&s;ion con&s;idered ab&s;tractedly from the immediate intentions, characters, and connexions of the per&s;ons concerned, appears to be of as &s;imple a kind as the nature of a &s;ubordinate government and the liberty of the &s;ubject can admit. The
<PB N="173" REF="018344_0181_0FA5D4FF2D595060">
people, who are the natural and original &s;ource of power, had a repre&s;entation in a body cho&s;en by them&s;elves; and the king was repre&s;ented by a pre&s;ident and coun|cil of his own appointment; each had the right of in&s;tructing their repre&s;entative, and the king had the &s;uperior prerogative of di&s;annulling the acts of the whole at his plea&s;ure. The principal blemi&s;h in the commi&s;&s;ion was the right claimed by the king of di&s;continuing the repre&s;entation of the people, whenever he &s;hould find it inconvenient, after he had &s;olemnly en|gaged to continue this privilege. The clau&s;e, indeed, is artfully worded, and might be con&s;trued to imply more or le&s;s at plea&s;ure. Herein Charles was con&s;i&s;t|ent with him&s;elf, parliaments being his aver&s;ion. However, there was in this plan as much of the &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution as there could be any founda|tion for in &s;uch a colony; for here was no third branch to form a balance between the king or his repre&s;entative, and the peo|ple. The in&s;titution of an hou&s;e of peers in Britain was the re&s;ult of the feudal &s;y&s;|tem: the barons being lords of the &s;oil and enjoying a &s;overeignty within their own territories and over their own va&s;&s;als; the con&s;titution was formed by the union

of the&s;e di&s;tinct e&s;tates under one common &s;overeign. But there was nothing &s;imilar to this in New-England. The &s;ettlements began here by an equal divi&s;ion of pro|perty among independent freemen. Lord|&s;hip and v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;alage were held in abhorrence. The yeomanry were the proprietors of the &s;oil and the natural defenders of their own rights and property; and they knew no &s;uperior but the king. A council, whether appointed by him or cho&s;en by the people could not form a di&s;tinct body, becau&s;e they could not be independent. Had &s;uch a &s;imple form of colony government been more generally adopted, and per&s;evering|ly adhered to, and admini&s;tered only by the mo&s;t delicate hands, it might have &s;erved better than any other, to perpetuate the dependence of the colonies on the Bri|ti&s;h crown.</P>

They would gladly have declined acting in their new capacity; but con&s;idering the temper of the government in England, the una|voidable nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to the change, and the danger (upon their refu&s;al) of others being appointed who would be inimical to the country, they agreed to qualify them&s;elves, determining to do what good, and keep off what harm they were able.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Rec.</NOTE> They therefore publi&s;hed the commi&s;&s;ion, and took the oaths on the twenty &s;econd day of January, which was beyond the utmo&s;t time limited in the commi&s;&s;ion.

The pre&s;ident and council with the a&s;&s;embly were a &s;upreme court of judicature, with a jury when de&s;ired by the parties; and three inferior courts were con&s;tituted at Dover, Hampton and Port&s;mouth.

and with the &s;ame &s;pirit, as before the &s;e|paration. A jealous watch was kept over their rights and privileges, and every en|croachment upon them was with&s;tood to the utmo&s;t. The duties and re&s;trictions e&s;tabli&s;hed by the acts of trade and navi|gation were univer&s;ally di&s;gu&s;tful, and the more &s;o as Randolph was appointed col|lector, &s;urveyor and &s;earcher of the cu&s;toms throughout New-England. In the exe|cution of his commi&s;&s;ion he &s;eized a ketch belonging to Port&s;mouth, but bound from Maryland to Ireland, which had put into this port for a few days. The ma&s;ter Mark Hunking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 23.</NOTE> brought an action again&s;t him at a &s;pecial court before the pre&s;ident and council, and recovered damages and co&s;ts to the amount of thirteen pounds.

He was &s;entenced to pay a fine of ten pounds, and &s;tand committed till it was paid. But though Randolph's authority was denied, yet they made an order of their own for the ob&s;ervation of the acts of trade, and appointed officers of their own to &s;ee them executed. They had been long under the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts government, and learned their political principles from them; and as they had been u&s;ed to think that all royal authority flowed in the channel of the charter, &s;o they now thought that no authority derived from the crown could be regularly exerci&s;ed in the province but through their commi&s;&s;ion. In this they rea&s;oned agreeably not only to their former principles, but to their fundamental law, to which they &s;teadily adhered, though they had no rea&s;on to think it would be

<P>In the latter end of the year Ma&s;on ar|rived from England with a mandamus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 30.</NOTE> re|quiring the council to admit him to a feat at the board,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1681.</NOTE> which was accordingly done.

His agents, or &s;tew|ards as they were called, had rendered them&s;elves obnoxious by demanding rents of &s;everal per&s;ons and threatening to &s;ell their hou&s;es for payment. The&s;e proceed|ings rai&s;ed a general unea&s;ine&s;s; and pe|titions were &s;ent from each town, as well as from divers individuals, to the council

for protection; who taking up the matter judicially publi&s;hed an order prohibiting Ma&s;on or his agents at their peril to re|peat &s;uch irregular proceedings, and de|claring their intention to tran&s;mit the grievances and complaints of the people to the king. Upon this, Ma&s;on would no longer &s;it in council, though de&s;ired, nor appear when &s;ent for; when they threat|ened to deal with him as an offender, he threatened to appeal to the king, and pub|li&s;hed a &s;ummons to the pre&s;ident and &s;e|veral members of the council, and others to appear before his maje&s;ty in three months.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1682.</NOTE>EXPERIENCE having now con|vinced Ma&s;on, that the government which he had procured to be erected, was not likely to be admini&s;tered in a manner favourable to his views, he made it his bu&s;ine&s;s, on his return to England, to &s;o|licit a change; in con&s;equence of which it was determined to commi&s;&s;ion Edward Cranfield, e&s;q. lieutenant-governor and commander in chief of New-Hamp&s;hire. By a deed enrolled in the court of chan|cery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 25,</NOTE> Ma&s;on &s;urrendered to the king one fifth part of the quit-rents, which had or &s;hould become due: The&s;e with the fines and forfeitures which had accrued to the crown &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the pro|vince, and which &s;hould afterward ari&s;e, were appropriated to the &s;upport of the
<PB N="189" REF="018344_0197_0FA5D50F6741C630">
governor. But this being deemed too precarious a foundation, Ma&s;on by ano|ther deed mortgaged the whole province to Cranfield, for twenty-one years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MSS in the files.</NOTE> as &s;e|curity for the payment of one hundred and fifty pounds per annum, for the &s;pace of &s;even years. On this encouragement Cranfield relinqui&s;hed a profitable office at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fitch's MS.</NOTE> with the view of bettering his fortune here.</P>
<P>By the commi&s;&s;ion, which bears date the ninth of May, the governor was im|powered to call, adjourn, prorogue and di&s;&s;olve general courts; to have a nega|tive voice in all acts of government; to &s;u&s;pend any of the council when he &s;hould &s;ee ju&s;t cau&s;e (and every coun&s;ellor &s;o &s;u|&s;pended was declared incapable of being elected into the general a&s;&s;embly;) to ap|point a deputy-governor, judges, ju&s;tices, and other officers, by his &s;ole authority; and to execute the powers of vice-admiral. The ca&s;e of Ma&s;on was recited nearly in the &s;ame words as in the former commi&s;|&s;ion, and the &s;ame directions were given to the governor to reconcile differences, or &s;end ca&s;es fairly &s;tated to the king in council, for his deci&s;ion. The coun&s;ellors named in this commi&s;&s;ion were Ma&s;on, who is &s;tyled proprietor, Waldron, Daniel,
<PB N="190" REF="018344_0198_0FA5D51018ADBBD8">
Vaughan, Martyn, Gilman, Stileman and Clements: The&s;e were of the former council, and to them were added Walter Barefoote and Richard Chamberlayne.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Records.</NOTE>Cranfield arrived and publi&s;hed his com|mi&s;&s;ion on the fourth of October, and within &s;ix days Waldron and Martyn were &s;u&s;pended from the council, on certain ar|ticles exhibited again&s;t them by Ma&s;on. This early &s;pecimen of the exerci&s;e of power mu&s;t have been intended as a pub|lic affront to them, in revenge for their former &s;pirited conduct; otherwi&s;e their names might have been left out of the commi&s;&s;ion when it was drawn.</P>
<P>The people now plainly &s;aw the dan|gerous de&s;igns formed again&s;t them. The negative voice of a governor, his right of &s;u&s;pending coun&s;ellors, and appointing officers, by his own authority, were wholly unprecedented in New-England; and they had the &s;ingular mortification to &s;ee the crown not only appointing two branches of their legi&s;lature, but claiming a nega|tive on the election of their repre&s;entatives, in a particular ca&s;e, which might &s;ome|times be e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to their own &s;ecurity. They well knew that the &s;ole de&s;ign of the&s;e novel and extraordinary powers was to facilitate the entry of the
<PB N="191" REF="018344_0199_0FA5D510DAD91BA0">
claimant on the lands which &s;ome of them held by virtue of grants from the &s;ame authority, and which had all been fairly purcha&s;ed of the Indians; a right which they believed to be of more validity than any other. Having by their own labour and expence &s;ubdued a rough wilderne&s;s, defended their families and e&s;tates again&s;t the &s;avage enemy, without the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from the claimant, and held po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion for above fifty years; they now thought it hard and cruel, that when they had ju&s;t recovered from the horrors of a bloody war, they &s;hould have their liberty abridged, and their property demanded, to &s;atisfy a claim which was at be&s;t di&s;putable, and in their opinion groundle&s;s. On the other hand it was deemed unju&s;t, that grants made under the royal authority &s;hould be di&s;regarded; and that &s;o great a &s;um as had been expended by the ance&s;|tor of the claimant, to promote the &s;ettle|ment of the country, &s;hould be entirely lo&s;t to him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;on's Will.</NOTE> e&s;pecially as he had foregone &s;ome ju&s;t claims on the e&s;tate as a condi|tion of inheritance. Had the inhabitants by any fraudulent means impeded the de|&s;igns of the original grantee, or embezzled his intere&s;t, there might have been a ju&s;t demand for damages; but the un&s;ucce&s;s|fulne&s;s

<P>An a&s;&s;embly, being &s;ummoned, met on the fourteenth of November; with who&s;e concurrence a new body of laws was enacted, in &s;ome re&s;pects different from the former; the fundamental law being omitted and an alteration made in the appointment of jurors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Laws.</NOTE> which was now ordered to be done by the &s;heriff, after the cu&s;tom in England.</P>

<P>This appearance of good humour was but &s;hort-lived;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1683.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 20.</NOTE> for at the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;embly, the governor and council having tendered them a bill for the &s;up|port of government, which they did not approve, and they having offered him &s;e|veral bills which he &s;aid were contrary to law, he di&s;&s;olved them; having previou&s;ly &s;u&s;pended Stileman from the council and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from the command of the fort, for &s;uffering a ve&s;&s;el under &s;eizure to go out of the harbour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Rec.</NOTE> Barefoote was made captain of the fort in his room.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;olution of the A&s;&s;embly, a thing before unknown, aggravated the popular di&s;content, and kindled the re&s;entment of &s;ome ra&s;h per&s;ons in Hampton and Exe|ter; who, headed by Edward Gove, a member of the di&s;&s;olved a&s;&s;embly, declar|ed by &s;ound of trumpet for <Q>liberty and reformation.</Q>
There had been a town meeting at Hampton, when a new clerk was cho&s;en and their records &s;ecured. Gove went from town to town proclaiming what had been done at Hampton, carrying his
<PB N="194" REF="018344_0202_0FA5D3E768024770">
arms, declaring that the governor was a traitor and had exceeded his commi&s;&s;ion, and that he would not lay down his arms till matters were &s;et right, and endeavour|ing to excite the principal men in the pro|vince to join in a confederacy to overturn the government. His project appeared to them &s;o wild and dangerous, that they not only di&s;approved it, but informed a|gain&s;t him and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in apprehending him. Hearing of their de&s;ign, he collect|ed his company, and appeared in arms; but on the per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;ome of his friends he &s;urrendered. A &s;pecial court was im|mediately commi&s;&s;ioned for his trial, of which Major Waldron &s;at as judge, with William Vaughan and Thomas Daniel a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The grand jury pre&s;ented a bill in which Edward Gove, John Gove, his &s;on, and William Hely, of Hampton; Jo&s;eph, John and Robert Wadleigh, three brothers, Thomas Rawlins, Mark Baker and John Sleeper, of Exeter, were charg|ed with high-trea&s;on. Gove, who behav|ed with great in&s;olence before the court, and pretended to ju&s;tify what he had done, was convicted and received &s;entence of death in the u&s;ual hideous form;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 1.</NOTE> and his e&s;tate was &s;eized,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of Special Courts.</NOTE> as forfeited to the crown. The others were convicted of being ac|complices,
<PB N="195" REF="018344_0203_0FA5D3E8C7690C88">
and re&s;pited. The king's plea&s;ure being &s;ignified to the governor that he &s;hould pardon &s;uch as he judged objects of mercy; they were all &s;et at li|berty but Gove, who was &s;ent to England, and impri&s;oned in the tower of London about three years. On his repeated peti|tions to the king, and by the intere&s;t of Randolph with the Earl of Clarendon, then lord chamberlain, he obtained his pardon and returned home in 1686, with an order to the then pre&s;ident and council of New-England to re&s;tore his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Gove in his petitions to the king plead|ed "a di&s;temper of mind" as the cau&s;e of tho&s;e actions for which he was pro&s;ecuted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gove's Papers.</NOTE> He al&s;o &s;peaks in &s;ome of his private let|ters of a drinking match at his hou&s;e, and that he had not &s;lept for twelve days and nights, about that time. When the&s;e things are con&s;idered, it is not hard to ac|count for his conduct. From a letter which he wrote to the court while in pri|&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS in files.</NOTE> one would &s;uppo&s;e him to have been di&s;ordered in his mind. His puni&s;hment was by much too &s;evere, and his trial was hurried on too fa&s;t, it being only &s;ix days after the commi&s;&s;ion of his crime. Had he been indicted only for a riot there would have been no difficulty in the proof, nor

hard&s;hip in inflicting the legal penalty. Waldron, it is &s;aid, &s;hed tears when pro|nouncing the &s;entence of death upon him.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth of February the go|vernor, by adverti&s;ement, called upon the inhabitants to take out lea&s;es from Ma&s;on within one month, otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t, pur&s;uant to his in&s;tructions, certify the re|fu&s;al to the king, that Ma&s;on might be di&s;charged of his obligation to grant them. Upon this &s;ummons and within the time &s;et, Major Waldron, John Wingett and Thomas Roberts, three of the principal landholders in Dover, waited on the go|vernor to know his plea&s;ure, who directed them to agree with Ma&s;on. They then retired into another room where Ma&s;on was, and propo&s;ed to refer the matter to the governor, that he might according to his commi&s;&s;ion, &s;tate the matter to the king for his deci&s;ion. This propo&s;al Ma|&s;on rejected, &s;aying that unle&s;s they would own his title, he would have nothing to do with them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weare's MS.</NOTE> While they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cour&s;e the governor came in and de&s;ired them to depart.</P>
<P>This piece of conduct is difficult to be accounted for, it being directly in the face of the commi&s;&s;ion. Had the method there|in pre&s;cribed, and by the&s;e men propo&s;ed,
<PB N="197" REF="018344_0205_0FA5D3EA174BD630">
been adopted, it was natural to expect that the king, who had all along favoured Ma&s;on's preten&s;ions, would have deter|mined the ca&s;e as much to his wi&s;h as upon an appeal from a judicial court; be&s;ides, he had now the faire&s;t opportunity to have it decided in the &s;horte&s;t way, to which his antagoni&s;ts mu&s;t have &s;ubmitted, it being their own propo&s;al. His refu&s;al to accede to it was a capital mi&s;take, as it left both him and Cranfield expo&s;ed to the charge of di&s;obedience. But it afforded a powerful plea in behalf of the people; who&s;e confidence in the royal ju&s;tice would have induced them to comply with the di|rections in the commi&s;&s;ion. It being now impo&s;&s;ible to have the controver&s;y thus decided they determined to hearken to none of his propo&s;als. As he generally met with oppo&s;ition and contradiction he was induced to utter many ra&s;h &s;ayings in all companies. He threatened to &s;eize the principal e&s;tates, beggar their owners, and provoke them to rebellion by bring|ing a frigate into the harbour and procur|ing &s;oldiers to be quartered on the inhabi|tants.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weare's MS.</NOTE> The&s;e threats were &s;o far from in|timidating the people that they &s;erved the more firmly to unite them in their de|termination not to &s;ubmit; and each par|ty
<PB N="198" REF="018344_0206_0FA5D3EB18CC57C8">
was now warm in their oppo&s;ition and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The governor on &s;ome fre&s;h pretence &s;u&s;pended Waldron, Martyn and Gilman from the council. The deaths of Daniels and Clements made two other vacancies. Vaughan held his &s;eat the longe&s;t, but was at length thru&s;t out for his non-com|pliance with &s;ome arbitrary mea&s;ures. So that the governor had it in his power to mo|del the council to his mind, which he did by appointing at various times Nathanael Fry|er, Robert Eliot, John Hinckes, James Sherlock, Francis Champernoon and Ed|ward Randolph, e&s;quires. The judicial courts were al&s;o filled with officers proper for the intended bu&s;ine&s;s. Barefoote, the deputy governor, was judge; Ma&s;on was chancellor; Chamberlayne was clerk and prothonotary; Randolph was attorney ge|neral,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Rec.</NOTE> and Sherlock provo&s;t mar&s;hal and &s;heriff. Some who had always been di&s;af|fected to the country, and others who had been awed by threats or flattered by promi&s;es took lea&s;es from Ma&s;on; and the&s;e &s;erved for under &s;heriffs, jurors, evidences, and other nece&s;&s;ary per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Things being thus prepared, Ma&s;on be|gan his law-&s;uits by a writ again&s;t Major Waldron, (who had always di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="199" REF="018344_0207_0FA5D3EC96691368">
him&s;elf in oppo&s;ition to his claim) for holding lands and felling timber to the amount of four thou&s;and pounds. The major appeared in court, and challenged every one of the jury as intere&s;ted per|&s;ons, &s;ome of them having taken lea&s;es of Ma&s;on, and all of them living upon the lands which he claimed. The judge then cau&s;ed the oath of voire dire to be admini|&s;tered to each juror, purporting <Q>that he was not concerned in the lands in que|&s;tion, and that he &s;hould neither gain nor lo&s;e by the cau&s;e.</Q>
Upon which the major &s;aid aloud to the people pre&s;ent, <Q>That his was a leading ca&s;e, and that if he were ca&s;t they mu&s;t all become te|nants to Ma&s;on; and that all per&s;ons in the province being intere&s;ted, none of them could legally be of the jury.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS in the files.</NOTE></Q>
The ca&s;e however went on; but he made no defence, a&s;&s;erted no title, and gave no evi|dence on his part. Judgment was given again&s;t him and at the next court of &s;e&s;&s;i|ons he was fined five pounds for <Q>muti|nous and &s;editious words.</Q></P>
<P>Suits were then in&s;tituted again&s;t all the principal landholders in the province, who, following Waldron's example, never made any defence. Some, chiefly of Hampton, gave in writing their rea&s;ons for not join|ing
<PB N="200" REF="018344_0208_0FA5D3ED16BF7C80">
i&s;&s;ue; which were, the refu&s;al of Ma|&s;on to comply with the directions in the commi&s;&s;ion; the impropriety of a jury's determining what the king had expre&s;sly re&s;erved to him&s;elf; and the incompetency of the jury, they being all intere&s;ted per|&s;ons, one of whom had &s;aid that <Q>he would &s;pend his e&s;tate to make Ma&s;on's right good.</Q>
The&s;e rea&s;ons were irri|tating rather than convincing to the court. The jury never he&s;itated in their verdicts. From &s;even to twelve cau&s;es were di&s;patch|ed in a day, and the co&s;ts were multiplied from five to twenty pounds. Executions were i&s;&s;ued, of which two or three only were levied; but Ma&s;on could neither keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the premi&s;es nor di&s;po&s;e of them by &s;ale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MSS in files, and Weare's MSS.</NOTE> &s;o that the owners &s;till enjoy|ed them. Several threatened to appeal to the king but Major Vaughan alone made the experiment.</P>
<P>A &s;uit was al&s;o commenced again&s;t Martyn who had been trea&s;urer, for the fines and forfeitures received by him, during the former admini&s;tration; and judgment was recovered for &s;eventy one pounds with co&s;ts. Martyn petitioned Ma&s;on as chancellor, &s;etting forth that he had received and di&s;po&s;ed of the mo|ney according to the orders of the late pre|&s;ident and council, and praying that the
<PB N="201" REF="018344_0209_0FA5D3EDE17D6510">
whole burden might not lie upon him. A decree was then i&s;&s;ued for the other &s;urviving members of the late council, and the heirs of tho&s;e who were dead, to bear their proportion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">MSS in files.</NOTE> This decree was afterward rever&s;ed by the king in council.</P>
<P>Cranfield with his council had now a&s;|&s;umed the whole legi&s;lative power. They prohibited ve&s;&s;els from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts to enter the port, becau&s;e the acts of trade were not ob&s;erved in that colony: They fixed the dimen&s;ions of merchantable lum|ber; altered the value of &s;ilver money, which had always pa&s;&s;ed by weight at &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence per ounce; and ordered that dollars &s;hould be receiv|ed at &s;ix &s;hillings each, which was then a great hard&s;hip; as many of them were greatly deficient in weight: They al&s;o changed the bounds of town&s;hips; e&s;ta|bli&s;hed fees of office; made regulations for the package of fi&s;h, and ordered the con&s;tables to forbear collecting any town or pari&s;h taxes till the province tax was paid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Rec.</NOTE> and the accounts &s;ettled with the trea&s;urer.</P>
<P>The public grievances having become in&s;upportable, the people were driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of making a vigorous &s;tand for their liberties. The only regular way
<PB N="202" REF="018344_0210_0FA5D3EEA827D0D0">
was by complaint to the king. Having privately communicated their &s;entiments to each other, and rai&s;ed money by &s;ub|&s;cription, they appointed Nathaniel Weare, e&s;q. of Hampton their agent; and the four towns having drawn and &s;ub&s;cribed di&s;tinct petitions of the &s;ame tenor, Weare pri|vately withdrew to Bo&s;ton from whence he &s;ailed for England. Major Vaughan who accompanied him to Bo&s;ton, and was appointed to procure depo&s;itions to &s;end after him, was upon his return to Port&s;|mouth, brought to an examination, treated with great in&s;olence and required to find &s;ureties for his good behaviour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MSS in Files.</NOTE> which, having broken no law, he refu&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this refu&s;al he is countenanced by the example of the great Selden, and other members of parliament who were impri&s;oned by order of Charles I. in 1629. <BIBL>Maca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ay's Hi&s;t.

<P>But Moody was marked as an object of peculiar vengeance. He had for &s;ome time rendered him&s;elf obnoxious by the freedom and plainne&s;s of his pulpit di&s;|cour&s;es, and his &s;trictne&s;s in admini&s;tering the di&s;cipline of the church; one in&s;tance of which merits particular notice. Ran|dolph having &s;eized a ve&s;&s;el, &s;he was in the night carried out of the harbour. The owner, who was a member of the church, &s;wore that he knew nothing of it; but upon trial there appeared &s;trong &s;u&s;picions that he had perjured him&s;elf. He found means to make up the matter with the governor and collector; but Moody, be|ing concerned for the purity of his church, reque&s;ted of the governor copies of the evidence, that the offender might be called to account in the way of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;|cipline. Cranfield &s;ternly refu&s;ed, &s;aying

The penal laws again&s;t nonconformi&s;ts were at this time executing with great rigour in England; and Cranfield, ambitious to ape his royal ma&s;ter, determined to play off the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical artillery here, the direction of which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be deputed to him with his other powers. He had attempt|ed to impo&s;e upon the people the ob&s;er|vation of the thirtieth of January as a fa&s;t, and re&s;train them from manual la|bour at Chri&s;tma&s;s; but his capital &s;troke was to i&s;&s;ue an order in council <Q>that af|ter the fir&s;t of January, the mini&s;ters &s;hould admit all per&s;ons of &s;uitable years and not vicious, to the Lord's &s;upper,

<P>Upon a calm review of this pro&s;ecution, one can hardly tell which is mo&s;t dete&s;ta|ble, the vindictive temper which gave it birth; or the profanene&s;s and hypocri&s;y with which it was conducted. The pre|tended zeal of the pro&s;ecutors was totally incon&s;i&s;tent with a due regard to tho&s;e laws, and the principles of that church, for which they made them&s;elves &s;uch con|temptible champions. For it had been long before this time, a received opinion in the church of England, that the vali|dity of all the &s;acramental admini&s;trations depends on authority derived from the apo&s;tles, by <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> ordination, in an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and one of the &s;tatutes on which the pro&s;ecution was

grounded enacts, <Q>that no per&s;on &s;hall pre&s;ume to con&s;ecrate and admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stat. 13 &amp; 14 Car. II.</NOTE> before he be ordained a prie&s;t by epi&s;copal ordination, on pain of forfeiting for every offence one hun|dred pounds.</Q>
The mini&s;ters then in the province, being de&s;titute of the grand pre-requi&s;ite, were incapable by the act, of doing what was &s;o peremptorily requir|ed of them; and had they complied with the governor's order, mu&s;t have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the penalty, if he had plea&s;|ed to exact it from them. But the extend|ing the&s;e penalties to the king's Ameri|can &s;ubjects, who had fled hither from the rod of prelatic tyranny, was a mo&s;t unwarrantable &s;tretch of power; &s;ince the la&s;t of the&s;e acts, and the only one which had been made &s;ince the &s;ettlement of the colonies, was expre&s;sly re&s;tricted in its ope|ration, to <Q>the realm of England, domi|nion of Wales, and town of Berwick upon Tweed.</Q></P>
<P>Di&s;appointed in all his &s;chemes for rai&s;|ing money by an a&s;&s;embly, Cranfield next ventured on the project of taxing the peo|ple without their con&s;ent. The pretext for this was a clau&s;e in the commi&s;&s;ion, impowering him, with the council, <Q>to continue &s;uch taxes as had been former|ly
<PB N="212" REF="018344_0220_0FA5D3F96D25A1E8">
levied, until a general a&s;&s;embly could be called.</Q>
This had been done, with|out offence, at the beginning both of this and the former admini&s;tration, when the change of government rendered it nece&s;|&s;ary. But the council, though too much devoted to him, were not ea&s;ily per&s;uad|ed into the mea&s;ure at this time; till fear at length accompli&s;hed what rea&s;on could not approve: for, letters being received from the ea&s;tward, informing of the di&s;|covery of a plot among the Indians, who were in&s;tigated by Ca&s;tine the Frenchman to renew the war early in the &s;pring,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 14.</NOTE> the council were &s;ummoned in ha&s;te, and pre|&s;ently agreed to the governor's propo&s;al, for continuing &s;uch taxes as had been for|merly laid, which he told them was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the immediate defence and &s;e|curity of the province. This affair, how|ever, was kept &s;ecret for the pre&s;ent; and the people were fir&s;t to be convinced of the governor's paternal care and kindne&s;s in taking the nece&s;&s;ary precautions for their &s;afety.<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 13.</NOTE> It was ordered that the meeting-hou&s;es in each town &s;hould be fortified, and bye garri&s;ons were e&s;tabli&s;hed in con|venient places: Supplies of ammunition were ordered to be provided: Circular letters were di&s;patched to the governors

of the neighbouring colonies, informing them of the danger; and, to crown the whole, Cranfield him&s;elf, at the reque&s;t of the council, undertook a tour to New-York to &s;olicit the governor, Dongan, for a number of the Mohawks to come down and de&s;troy the ea&s;tern Indians;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Records.</NOTE> promi&s;ing to pay them for their &s;ervices out of the money which was thus to be rai&s;ed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vaughan's Journal.</NOTE></P>
<P>At his return from this excur&s;ion, he found him&s;elf under &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ment in his favourite views, from a letter of the lords of trade, which directed him to make u&s;e of an a&s;&s;embly, in rai&s;ing money on the people. He could not, therefore, avoid calling one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 27.</NOTE> though he immediately di&s;|&s;olved it, becau&s;e &s;everal of the members were tho&s;e whom he had formerly order|ed to be made con&s;tables. At the &s;ame time, in his letters to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, he repre&s;ented the a&s;&s;embly as per&s;ons of &s;uch a mutinous and rebellious di&s;po&s;ition, that it was not &s;afe to let them convene; that they had never given any thing to|ward the &s;upport of government; that he was obliged to rai&s;e money without them; and that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;erve his maje&s;ty's intere&s;t without a &s;hip of war to enforce his orders; and finally he de|&s;ired leave to go to the We&s;t-Indies for the

<P>But however di&s;affected to the governor and his creatures, they were always ready to te&s;tify their obedience to the royal or|ders; an in&s;tance of which occurred at this time. The &s;eas of America and the We&s;t-Indies being much infe&s;ted with pirates, the king &s;ent of orders to all the go|vernors and colony a&s;&s;emblies, directing acts to be made for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of pi|racy and robbery on the high &s;eas.

<P>The tax-bills were fir&s;t put into the hands of the newly made con&s;tables; who &s;oon returned them, informing the gover|nor that the people were &s;o aver&s;e from the method, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to collect the money. The provo&s;t, Thomas Thur|ton, was then commanded to do it, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his deputies and the con|&s;tables.

The people &s;till refu&s;ing com|pliance, their cattle and goods were taken by di&s;treint and &s;old by auction: Tho&s;e who would neither pay nor di&s;cover their goods to the officers, were apprehended and impri&s;oned; and &s;ome of the con&s;ta|bles, who refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;uffered the &s;ame fate. The more con&s;iderate of the people were di&s;po&s;ed to bear the&s;e grievances, though highly irritating, till they could know the re&s;ult of their applications to the king. But in a country where the love of liberty had ever been the ruling pa&s;&s;ion, it could not be expected but that &s;ome forward &s;pirits would break the re&s;traints of prudence, and take a &s;ummary method to put a &s;top to their oppre&s;&s;ions. Several per&s;ons had declared that they would &s;ooner part with their lives, than &s;uffer di&s;treints; and a&s;&s;ociations were formed for mutual &s;upport.

him for other men's lands, &s;o that they were engaged by their intere&s;t to &s;et up Ma&s;on's title: That Ma&s;on had &s;ued forty per&s;ons, and ca&s;t all; and that the governor's interpo&s;al to &s;tate the ca&s;es, as by his commi&s;&s;ion he was directed, had been refu&s;ed though de&s;ired; and that the defendants pleas grounded on the laws of England were rejected: That they could not reconcile the verdict with the attachment, nor the execution with the verdict, nor their practice under co|lour of the execution with either; that the verdict found the lands &s;ued for ac|cording to the royal commi&s;&s;ion and in|&s;tructions, and that commi&s;&s;ion only gave power to &s;tate the ca&s;e if Ma&s;on and the people could not agree; but the execu|tion took land and all: That the charge of every action was about &s;ix pounds, though nothing was done in court, but reading the commi&s;&s;ion and &s;ome blank grants without hand or &s;eal; and the&s;e were not read for one ca&s;e in ten: That court charges were exacted in money, which many had not; who though they tendered cattle, were committed to pri|&s;on for non-payment: That mini&s;ters, contrary to his maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ion, which granted liberty of con&s;cience to all

prote&s;tants, had their dues withheld from them, even tho&s;e that were due before Cranfield came, and were threatened with &s;ix months impri&s;onment for not admi|ni&s;tering the &s;acrament according to the liturgy: That though the general a&s;&s;em|bly agreed that Spani&s;h money &s;hould pa&s;s by weight, the governor and council ordered pieces of eight to pa&s;s for &s;ix &s;hil|lings, though under weight: That men were commonly compelled to enter into bonds of great penalty, to appear and an|&s;wer to what &s;hould be objected again&s;t them, when no crime was alledged: That they had few laws but tho&s;e made by the governor and council, when his commi&s;&s;ion directed the general a&s;&s;embly to make laws: That the courts were kept in a remote corner of the province; and the &s;heriff was a &s;tranger and had no vi&s;ible e&s;tate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weare's MSS.</NOTE> and &s;o was not re&s;pon&s;i|ble for failures.</Q></P>
<P>Upon this complaint, an hearing was had before the lords of trade on Tue&s;day the tenth of March; and their lord&s;hips reported to the king, on three articles on|ly of the complaint viz.
<Q>That Cranfield had not pur&s;ued his in&s;tructions with re|gard to Ma&s;on's controver&s;y; but in&s;tead thereof had cau&s;ed courts to be held and
<PB N="221" REF="018344_0229_0FA5D4069C24B640">
titles to be decided, with exorbitant co&s;ts; and that he had exceeded his power in regulating the value of coins.</Q>
This re|port was accepted, and the king's plea&s;ure therein &s;ignified to him. At the &s;ame time, his reque&s;t for ab&s;ence being grant|ed, he, on receipt of the letters, privately embarked on board a ve&s;&s;el for Jamaica;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neal's Hi&s;t. &amp; Fitch's MS.</NOTE> and from thence went to England, where he obtained the collector&s;hip of Barbadoes. At his departure, Barefoote the deputy-governor took the chair; which he held till he was &s;uper&s;eded by Dudley's com|mi&s;&s;ion, as pre&s;ident of New-England.</P>
<P>Cranfield's ill conduct mu&s;t be a&s;cribed in a great mea&s;ure to his di&s;appointment of the gains which he expected to acquire, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Ma&s;on's title; which could be his only inducement to ac|cept of the government. This di&s;appoint|ment inflaming his temper, naturally vin|dictive and imperious, urged him to ac|tions not only illegal, but cruel and un|manly. A ruler never degrades his cha|racter more than when he perverts public ju&s;tice to gratify per&s;onal re&s;entment; he &s;hould puni&s;h none but the enemies of the laws, and di&s;turbers of the peace of the community over which he pre&s;ides.

or policy, for the &s;everity exerci&s;ed in the pro&s;ecution of Moody, candour would oblige us to make &s;ome allowance for hu|man frailty. His ordering the members of the a&s;&s;embly to be made con&s;tables, was a mode of revenge di&s;graceful to the cha|racter of the &s;upreme magi&s;trate. From the &s;ame ba&s;e di&s;po&s;ition, he is &s;aid to have employed &s;pies and pimps,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neal, vol. 2. p. 39.</NOTE> to find matter of accu&s;ation again&s;t people in their clubs, and private di&s;cour&s;e. And his deceit was equal to his malice; for, being at Bo&s;ton when the charter of that colony was call|ed in que&s;tion, and the people were &s;oli|citous to ward off the danger; he advi&s;ed them to make a private offer of two thou|&s;and guineas to the king, promi&s;ing to re|pre&s;ent them in a favourable light; but when they, not &s;u&s;pecting his intention, fol|lowed his advice, and &s;hewed him the let|ter which they had wrote to their agents for that purpo&s;e, he treacherou&s;ly repre&s;ented them as "di&s;loyal rogues;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. vol. 1. pag. 337.</NOTE>" and made them appear &s;o ridiculous that their agents were a&s;hamed to be &s;een at court. How|ever, when he had quitted the country, and had time for reflection, he grew a|&s;hamed of his mi&s;conduct, and while he was collector at Barbadoes, made a point of treating the ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fitch's MS.</NOTE> and other

<P>Nothing el&s;e occured during Barefoote's &s;hort admini&s;tration, except a treaty of friend&s;hip, between the Indians of Pena|cook and Saco, on the one part; and the people of New-Hamp&s;hire and Maine on the other. The foundation of this treaty &s;eems to have been laid in Cranfield's pro|ject of bringing down the Mohawks on the ea&s;tern Indians; which had once before proved a pernicious mea&s;ure; as they made no di&s;tinction between tho&s;e tribes which were at peace with the Engli&s;h, and tho&s;e which were at war.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The admini&s;tration of Dudley as pre&s;ident, and Andro&s;&s;e as governor of New-Eng|land. Ma&s;on's farther attempt. His di&s;appointment and death. Revolution. Sale to Allen. His commi&s;&s;ion for the government.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN an arbitrary government is determined to infringe the liber|ty of the people, it is ea&s;y to find preten|ces to &s;upport the mo&s;t unrighteous claims. King Charles the &s;econd in the lat|ter part of his reign was making large &s;trides toward de&s;poti&s;m. Charters, which ob&s;tructed his pernicious views, were by a perver&s;ion of the law decreed forfeited. The city of London, and mo&s;t of the cor|porations in England, either &s;uffered the execution of the&s;e &s;entences, or tamely &s;urrendered their franchi&s;es to the all-gra&s;ping hand of power. It could not be expected that in this general wreck of privileges the colonies of New-England could e&s;cape. The people of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts had long been viewed with a jealous eye.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. col. pap. p. 377.</NOTE> Though the king had repeatedly a&s;&s;ured them of his protection, and &s;o|lemnly
<PB N="229" REF="018344_0237_0FA5D411D5E20148">
confirmed their charter privileges; yet their &s;pirit and principles were &s;o to|tally di&s;&s;onant to the corrupt views of the court, that intriguing men found ea&s;y ac|ce&s;s to the royal ear, with complaints again&s;t them. Of the&s;e the mo&s;t invete|rate and indefatigable was Randolph,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutch. vol. 1. p. 329.</NOTE> who made no le&s;s than eight voyages in nine years acro&s;s the Atlantic, on this mi&s;chie|vous bu&s;ine&s;s. They were accu&s;ed of ex|tending their juri&s;diction beyond the bounds of their patent; of invading the prerogative by coining money; of not al|lowing appeals to the king from their courts; and, of ob&s;tru&s;ting the execution of the navigation and trade laws. By the king's command agents were &s;ent over to an&s;wer to the&s;e complaints. They found the prejudice again&s;t the colony &s;o &s;trong, that it was in vain to with&s;tand it; and &s;olicited in&s;tructions whether to &s;ubmit to the king's plea&s;ure, or to let the proceed|ings again&s;t them be i&s;&s;ued in form of law. A &s;olemn con&s;ultation being held, at which the clergy a&s;&s;i&s;ted, it was determined
<Q>to die by the hands of others rather than by their own.</Q>
Upon notice of this, the agents quitted England;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1683.</NOTE> and Ran|dolph, as the angel of death &s;oon followed them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> bringing a writ of quo warranto
<PB N="230" REF="018344_0238_0FA5D413A9533558">
from the king's bench; but the &s;cire facias which i&s;&s;ued from the chancery did not arrive till the time fixed for their appear|ance was elap&s;ed: This however was deemed too trivial an error to &s;top the proceedings; judgment was entered again&s;t them, and the charter declared forfeited.</P>
<P>The king died before a new form of government was &s;ettled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1685.</NOTE> but there could be no hope of favour from his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who inherited the arbitrary principles of his brother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 6.</NOTE> and was publickly known to be a bigoted papi&s;t.</P>
<P>The intended alteration in the govern|ment was introduced in the &s;ame gradual manner as it had been in New-Hamp&s;hire. A commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued, in which Jo&s;eph Dudley, e&s;quire, was appointed pre&s;ident of his maje&s;ty's territory and dominion of New-England; William Stoughton de|puty pre&s;ident; Simon Brad&s;treet, Robert Ma&s;on, John Fitz Winthrop, John Pyn|chon, Peter Bulkley, Edward Randolph, Wait Winthrop, Richard Warton, John U&s;her, Nathaniel Salton&s;tall, Bartho|lomew Gedney, Jonathan Tyng, Dud|ley Brad&s;treet, John Hinckes, and Ed|ward Tyng, coun&s;ellors. Their juri&s;|diction extended over Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, New-Hamp&s;hire, Maine and the Narrhagan|&s;et or King's province. The&s;e gentle|men
<PB N="231" REF="018344_0239_0FA5D4141CB7F1A8">
were mo&s;tly natives of the country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1686.</NOTE> &s;ome of them had been magi&s;trates, and one of them governor under the charter. No hou&s;e of deputies was mentioned in the commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The new form of government took place on the twenty fifth day of May; and on the tenth of June an order of council was i&s;&s;ued for &s;ettling the country courts, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;uch members of the council as re&s;ided in each county, and any others of them who might be pre&s;ent; with &s;uch ju&s;tices as were commi&s;&s;ioned for the pur|po&s;e. The&s;e courts had the power of try|ing and i&s;&s;uing all civil cau&s;es, and all criminal matters under life or limb; from them an appeal was allowed to a &s;uperior court held three times in the year at Bo&s;ton, for the whole territory; and from thence appeals, in certain ca&s;es, might be had to the king in council. Juries were pricked by the mar&s;hal and one ju&s;tice of each country, in a li&s;t given them by the &s;elect|men of the towns. A probate court was held at Bo&s;ton, by the pre&s;ident, and
<Q>in the other provinces and remote counties</Q>
by a judge and clerk appointed by the pre&s;ident. The territory was divided into four counties, viz. Suffolk, Middle&s;ex, E&s;&s;ex and Hamp&s;hire; and three provin|ces, viz. New-Hamp&s;hire, Maine, and
<PB N="232" REF="018344_0240_0FA5D414DADD4220">
King's province. By another order of the &s;ame date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed or|ders in the files.</NOTE> town-taxes could not be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but by allowance of two ju&s;tices; and the members of the council were exempted from paying any part thereof.</P>
<P>Things were conducted with tolerable decency, and the innovations were render|ed as little grievous as po&s;&s;ible; that the people might be induced more readily to &s;ubmit to the long meditated introduction of a governor-general.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 30.</NOTE>In December following, Sir Edmund Andro&s;&s;e who had been governor of New-York, arrived at Bo&s;ton with a commi&s;&s;ion, appointing him captain-general and go|vernor in chief of the territory and domi|nion of New-England, in which the co|lony of Plymouth was now included. By this commi&s;&s;ion, the governor with his council, five of whom were a quorum, were impowered to make &s;uch laws, im|po&s;e &s;uch taxes, and apply them to &s;uch purpo&s;es as they &s;hould think proper. They were al&s;o empowered to grant lands on &s;uch terms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Copy of the Commi&s;&s;i|on.</NOTE> and &s;ubject to &s;uch quit|rents, as &s;hould be appointed by the king. Inve&s;ted with &s;uch powers, the&s;e men were capable of the mo&s;t extravagant actions. Though Andro&s;&s;e, like his ma&s;ter, began his admini&s;tration with the faire&s;t profe&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="233" REF="018344_0241_0FA5D4159D06E880">
yet like him, he &s;oon violated them, and proved him&s;elf a fit in&s;trument for ac|compli&s;hing the mo&s;t execrable de&s;igns. Tho&s;e of his council who were backward in aiding his rapacious intentions were neglected. Seven being &s;ufficient for a full board, he &s;elected &s;uch only as were devoted to him, and with their concurrence did what he plea&s;ed. Randolph and Ma|&s;on were at fir&s;t among his confidents;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. vol. 1. p. 344.

Let it &s;uffice to ob|&s;erve, that the pre&s;s was re&s;trained; liber|ty of con&s;cience infringed; exorbitant fees and taxes demanded, without the voice or con&s;ent of the people, who had no privi|lege of repre&s;entation. The charter being vacated, it was pretended that all titles to land were annulled; and as to Indian deeds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolution in N. Eng. ju&s;tified, p. 21.</NOTE> Andro&s;&s;e declared them no better than "the &s;cratch of a bear's paw." Land|holders were obliged to take out patents for their e&s;tates which they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed forty or fifty years; for the&s;e patents ex|travagant fees were exacted, and tho&s;e who
<PB N="234" REF="018344_0242_0FA5D41657442958">
would not &s;ubmit to this impo&s;ition had writs of intru&s;ion brought again&s;t them, and their land patented to others. To hinder the people from con&s;ulting about the redre&s;s of their grievances, town-meetings were prohibited, except one in the month of May for the choice of town officers; and to prevent complaints being carried to England, no per&s;on was permit|ted to go out of the country without ex|pre&s;s leave from the governor. But not|with&s;tanding all the vigilance of the go|vernor, his emi&s;&s;aries and his guards, the re&s;olute and indefatigable Increa&s;e Mather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I. Mather's life, p. 107.</NOTE> mini&s;ter of the &s;econd church in Bo&s;ton, and pre&s;ident of the college, got on board a &s;hip and &s;ailed for England, with com|plaints in the name of the people again&s;t the governor, which he delivered with his own hand to the king; but finding no hope of redre&s;s, he waited the event of the revolution which was then expected.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1688.</NOTE>When the people groaned under &s;o many real grievances, it is no wonder that their fears and jealou&s;ies &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome that were imaginary.

At the &s;ame time, the large &s;trides that King James the &s;econd was making toward the e&s;tabli&s;hment of popery and de&s;poti&s;m, rai&s;ed the mo&s;t terrible apprehen&s;ions; &s;o that the report of the landing of the Prince of Orange in England was received here with the greate&s;t joy. Andro&s;&s;e was &s;o alarmed at the news; that he impri&s;oned the man who brought a copy of the prince's declaration, and publi&s;hed a proclamation commanding all per&s;ons to be in readine&s;s to oppo&s;e "any inva&s;ion from Holland," which met with as much di&s;regard as one he had i&s;&s;ued before, appointing a day of thank&s;giving for the birth of a Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>The people had now borne the&s;e inno|vations and impo&s;itions for about three years: Their patience was worn out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689.</NOTE> and their native love of freedom kindled at the pro&s;pect of deliverance. The news of a complete revolution in England had not reached them; yet &s;o &s;anguine were their expectations, &s;o eager were they to prove that they were animated by the &s;ame &s;pirit with their brethren at home, that upon the rumour of an intended ma&s;&s;acre in the town of Bo&s;ton by the governor's guards, they were wrought up to a degree of fury.

On the morning of the eighteenth of April the town was in arms, and the country flocking in to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The go|vernor, and tho&s;e who had fled with him to the fort, were &s;eized and committed to pri&s;on. The gentlemen who had been magi&s;trates under the charter, with Brad|&s;treet, the late governor, at their head, a&s;&s;umed the name of a council of &s;afety, and kept up a form of government, in the exigency of affairs, till orders arrived from England; when Andro&s;&s;e and his accom|plices were &s;ent home as pri&s;oners of &s;tate, to be di&s;po&s;ed of according to the king's plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The people of New-Hamp&s;hire had their &s;hare of &s;ufferings under this rapacious admini&s;tration; and Ma&s;on him&s;elf did not e&s;cape.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The war with the French and Indians, commonly called King William's war.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was the misfortune of this country to have enemies of different kinds to con|tend with at the &s;ame time. While the changes above related were taking place in their government, a fre&s;h war broke out on their frontiers, which, though a&s;|cribed to divers cau&s;es, was really kindled by the ra&s;hne&s;s of the &s;ame per&s;ons who were making havock of their liberties.</P>
<P>The lands from Penob&s;cot to Nova-Sco|tia had been ceded to the French, by the treaty of Breda,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. coll. pap. p. 548.</NOTE> in exchange for the i&s;land of St. Chri&s;topher. On the&s;e lands the Baron de St. Ca&s;tine had for many years re&s;ided, and carried on a large trade with the Indians; with whom he was intimate|ly connected; having &s;everal of their wo|men, be&s;ide a daughter of the &s;achem Madokawando, for his wives. The lands which had been granted by the crown of England to the duke of York (now King James the &s;econd) interfered with Ca&s;tine's plantation, as the duke claimed to the ri|ver St. Croix. A fort had been built by
<PB N="243" REF="018344_0251_0FA5D42194C9A7C0">
his order at Pemaquid, and a garri&s;on &s;ta|tioned there to prevent any intru&s;ion on his property. In 1686 a &s;hip belonging to Pa&s;cataqua landed &s;ome wines at Penob|&s;cot, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be within the French territory. Palmer and We&s;t, the duke's agents at Pemaquid went and &s;eized the wines; but by the influence of the French amba&s;&s;ador in England an order was ob|tained for the re&s;toration of them. Here|upon a new line was run which took Ca&s;|tine's plantation into the duke's territory. In the &s;pring of 1688,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1688.</NOTE> Andro&s;&s;e went in the Ro&s;e frigate, and plundered Ca&s;tine's hou&s;e and fort; leaving only the orna|ments of his chapel to con&s;ole him for the lo&s;s of his arms and goods.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. coll. pap. p. 562.</NOTE> This ba&s;e ac|tion provoked Ca&s;tine to excite the Indi|ans to a new war, pretences for which were not wanting on their part. They complained that the tribute of corn which had been promi&s;ed by the treaty of 1678, had been withheld; that the fi&s;hery of the river Saco had been ob&s;tructed by &s;eines; that their &s;tanding corn had been devour|ed by cattle belonging to the Engli&s;h; that their lands at Pemaquid had been patent|ed without their con&s;ent; and that they had been fraudulently dealt with in trade. Some of the&s;e complaints were doubtle&s;s
<PB N="244" REF="018344_0252_0FA5D422AF0B55C0">
well grounded; but none of them were ever enquired into or redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>They began to make repri&s;als at North Yarmouth by killing cattle. Ju&s;tice Black|man ordered &s;ixteen of them to be &s;eized and kept under guard at Falmouth; but others continued to rob and captivate the inhabitants. Andro&s;&s;e, who pretended to treat the Indians with mildne&s;s, command|ed tho&s;e whom Blackman had &s;eized to be &s;et at liberty. But this mildne&s;s had not the de&s;ired effect; the Indians kept their pri&s;oners, and murdered &s;ome of them in their barbarous frolicks. Andro&s;&s;e then changed his mea&s;ures, and thought to frighten them, with an army of &s;even hun|dred men, which he led into their coun|try in the month of November. The rigor of the &s;ea&s;on proved fatal to &s;ome of his men; but he never &s;aw an Indian in his whole march. The enemy were quiet during the winter.</P>

Some of tho&s;e In|dians, who were then &s;eized and &s;old into &s;lavery abroad, had found their way home, and could not re&s;t till they had revenge. Accordingly a confederacy being formed between the tribes of Penacook and Pig|wacket, and the &s;trange Indians (as they were called) who were incorporated with them, it was determined to &s;urpri&s;e the major and his neighbours, among whom they had all this time been peaceably con|ver&s;ant.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="018344_0254_0FA5D427AEF6C808">In that part of the town of Dover which lies about the fir&s;t falls in the river Co|checho, were five garri&s;oned hou&s;es; three on the North &s;ide, viz. Waldron's, Otis's and Heard's; and two on the &s;outh &s;ide, viz. Peter Coffin's and his &s;on's. The&s;e hou&s;es were &s;urrounded with timber-walls, the gates of which, as well as the hou&s;e doors, were &s;ecured with bolts and bars. The neighbouring families retired to the&s;e hou&s;es by night; but by an unaccountable negligence, no watch was kept. The In|dians who were daily pa&s;&s;ing through the town vi&s;iting and trading with the inha|bitants, as u&s;ual in time of peace, viewed their &s;ituation with an attentive eye. Some hints of a mi&s;chievous de&s;ign had been given out by their &s;quaws; but in &s;uch dark and ambiguous terms that no one could comprehend their meaning. Some of the people were unea&s;y; but Waldron who, from a long cour&s;e of experience, was in|timately acquainted with the Indians, and on other occa&s;ions had been ready enough to &s;u&s;pect them, was now &s;o thoroughly &s;ecure&punc; that when &s;ome of the people hint|ed their fears to him, he merrily bad them to go and plant their pumpkins, &s;aying that he would tell them when the Indians would break out. The very even|ing

before the mi&s;chief was done, being told by a young man that the town was full of Indians and the people were much concerned; he an&s;wered that he knew the Indians very well and there was no danger.</P>
<P>The plan which the Indians had pre-concerted was, that two &s;quaws &s;hould go to each of the garri&s;oned hou&s;es in the evening, and a&s;k leave to lodge by the fire; that in the night when the people were a&s;leep they &s;hould open the doors and gates, and give the &s;ignal by a whi&s;tle; upon which the &s;trange Indians, who were to be within hearing, &s;hould ru&s;h in, and take their long meditated revenge. This plan being ripe for execution, on the evening of Thur&s;day the twenty &s;eventh of June, two &s;quaws applied to each of the garri&s;ons for lodging, as they frequent|ly did in time of peace. They were ad|mitted into all but the younger Coffin's, and the people, at their reque&s;t, &s;hewed them how to open the doors, in ca&s;e they &s;hould have occa&s;ion to go out in the night. Me&s;andowit, one of their chiefs, went to Waldron's garri&s;on, and was kindly enter|tained, as he had often been before. The &s;quaws told the major, that a number of Indians were coming to trade with him the next day, and Me&s;andowit while at

&s;upper, with his u&s;ual familiarity, &s;aid,
<Q>Brother Waldron, what would you do if the &s;trange Indians &s;hould come?</Q>
The major carele&s;sly an&s;wered, that he could a&s;&s;emble an hundred men, by lifting up his finger. In this un&s;u&s;pecting confidence the family retired to re&s;t.</P>
<P>When all was quiet, the gates were o|pened and the &s;ignal given. The Indians entered, &s;et a guard at the door, and ru&s;h|ed into the major's apartment, which was an inner room. Awakened by the noi&s;e, he jumped out of bed, and though now advanced in life to the age of eighty years, he retained &s;o much vigour as to drive them with his &s;word, through two or three doors; but as he was returning for his other arms, they came behind him, &s;tun|ned him with an hatchet, drew him into his hall, and &s;eating him in an elbow chair on a long table in&s;ultingly a&s;ked him, "Who &s;hall judge Indians now?" They then obliged the people in the hou&s;e to get them &s;ome victuals; and when they had done eating, they cut the major acro&s;s the brea&s;t and belly with knives, each one with a &s;troke, &s;aying,
<Q>I cro&s;s out my ac|count.</Q>
They then cut off his no&s;e and ears, forcing them into his mouth; and when &s;pent with the lo&s;s of blood, he was

falling down from the table, one of them held his own &s;word under him, which put an end to his mi&s;ery. They al&s;o killed his &s;on in law Abraham Lee; but took his daughter Lee with &s;everal others, and having pillaged the hou&s;e, left it on fire. Otis's garri&s;on, which was next to the major's, met with the &s;ame fate; he was killed, with &s;everal others, and his wife and child were captivated. Heard's was &s;aved by the barking of a dog ju&s;t as the Indians were entering: Elder Wentworth, who was awakened by the noi&s;e pu&s;hed them out, and falling on his back, &s;et his feet again&s;t the gate and held it till he had alarmed the people; two balls were fired through it, but both mi&s;&s;ed him. Coffin's hou&s;e was &s;urprized, but as the Indians had no particular enmity to him, they &s;pared his life, and the lives of his family, and contented them&s;elves with pillaging the hou&s;e. Finding a bag of money, they made him throw it by handfuls on the floor, while they amu&s;ed them&s;elves in &s;crambling for it. They then went to the hou&s;e of his &s;on who would not admit the &s;quaws in the evening, and &s;ummoned him to &s;urrender, promi&s;ing him quarter: He declined their offer and determined to de|fend his hou&s;e, till they brought out his

father and threatened to kill him before his eyes: Filial affection then overcame his re&s;olution, and he &s;urrendered. They put both families together into a de&s;erted hou&s;e, intending to re&s;erve them for pri|&s;oners; but while the Indians were bu&s;y in plundering, they all e&s;caped.</P>
<P>Twenty three people were killed in this &s;urpri&s;al, and twenty nine were captivat|ed; five or &s;ix hou&s;es, with the mills, were burned; and &s;o expeditious were the Indians in the execution of their plot, that before the people could be collected from the other parts of the town to oppo&s;e them, they fled with their pri&s;oners and booty. As they pa&s;&s;ed by Heard's garri&s;on in their retreat, they fired upon it; but the people being prepared and re&s;olved to defend it, and the enemy being in ha&s;te, it was pre|&s;erved. The pre&s;ervation of its owner was more remarkable.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Heard, with her three &s;ons and a daughter, and &s;ome others, were re|turning in the night from Port&s;mouth. They pa&s;&s;ed up the river in their boat un|perceived by the Indians, who were then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;es; but &s;u&s;pecting danger by the noi&s;e which they heard, after they had landed they betook them|&s;elves to Waldron's garri&s;on, where

they &s;aw lights, which they imagined were &s;et up for direction to tho&s;e who might be &s;eeking a refuge. They knocked and begged earne&s;tly for admi&s;|&s;ion; but no an&s;wer being given, a young man of the company climbed up the wall, and &s;aw, to his inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urprize, an Indian &s;tanding in the door of the hou&s;e, with his gun. The woman was &s;o over|come with the fright that &s;he was unable to fly; but begged her children to &s;hift for them&s;elves; and they with heavy hearts, left her. When &s;he had a little recovered &s;he crawled into &s;ome bu&s;hes, and lay there till day-light. She then perceived an Indian coming toward her with a pi&s;tol in his hand; he looked at her and went away: returning, he looked at her again; and &s;he a&s;ked him what he would have; he made no an&s;wer, but ran yelling to the hou&s;e, and &s;he &s;aw him no more. She kept her place till the hou&s;e was burned, and the Indians were gone; and then re|turning home, found her own hou&s;e &s;afe. Her pre&s;ervation in the&s;e dangerous cir|cum&s;tances was the more remarkable, if (as it is &s;uppo&s;ed) it was an in&s;tance of ju&s;tice and gratitude in the Indians. For at the time when the four hundred were &s;eized in 1676, a young Indian e&s;caped

This Indian was one of the party who &s;urprized the place, and &s;he was well known to the mo&s;t of them.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, after the mi&s;chief was done, a letter from Secretary Addington, written by order of the government, di|rected to Major Waldron, giving him no|tice of the intention of the Indians to &s;ur|prize him under pretence of trade, fell in|to the hands of his &s;on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;&s;.

<P>The pri&s;oners taken at this time were mo&s;tly carried to Canada, and &s;old to the French; and the&s;e, &s;o far as I can learn, were the fir&s;t that ever were carried thither<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>One of the&s;e pri&s;oners was Sarah Gerri&s;h, a remarkably fine child of &s;even years old, and grand-daughter of Major Waldron, in who&s;e hou&s;e the lodged that fatal night. Some circum&s;tances attending her captivity are truly affecting. When &s;he was awaken|ed by the noi&s;e of the Indians in the hou&s;e, &s;he crept into ano|ther bed and hid her&s;elf under the clothes to e&s;cape their &s;earch. She remained in their hands till the next winter, and was &s;old from one to another &s;everal times. An Indian girl once pu&s;hed her into a river; but, catching by the bu&s;hes, &s;he e&s;caped drown|ing, yet dur&s;t not tell how &s;he came to be wet. Once &s;he was &s;o weary with travelling that &s;he did not awake in the morning till the Indians were gone, and then found her&s;elf alone in the woods, covered with &s;now, and without any food; having found their tracks &s;he went crying after them till they heard her and took her with them. At another time they kindled a great fire, and the young Indians told her &s;he was to be roa&s;ted. She bur&s;t into tears, threw her arms round her ma&s;ter's neck, and begged him to &s;ave her, which he promi&s;ed to do if &s;he would behave well. Being arrived in Canada, &s;he was bought by the Intendant's lady, who treated her courteou&s;ly, and &s;ent her to a nunnery for education. But when Sir William Phips was at Quebec &s;he was exchanged, and returned to her friends, with whom &s;he lived till &s;he was &s;ix|teen years old.</P>
<P>The wife of Richard Otis was taken at the &s;ame time, with an infant daughter of three months old. The French prie&s;ts took this child under their care, baptized her by the name of Chri&s;tina, and educated her in the Romi&s;h religion. She pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in a nunnery, but declined taking the veil, and was married to a Frenchman, by whom &s;he had two children. But her de&s;ire to &s;ee New-England was &s;o &s;trong, that upon an exchange of pri&s;oners in 1714, being then a widow, &s;he left both her children, who were not permitted to come with her, and returned home, where &s;he abjured the Romi&s;h faith. M. Siguenot, her former confe&s;&s;or, wrote her a flattering letter, warning her of her danger, inviting her to return to the bo&s;om of the catholic church, and repeating many gro&s;s calumnies which had formerly been vented again&s;t Lu|ther and the other reformers. This letter being &s;hewn to Gover|nor Burnet, he wrote her a &s;en&s;ible and ma&s;terly an&s;wer, refuting the arguments, and detecting the fal&s;ehoods it contained: Both the&s;e letters were printed. She was married afterward to Capt. Thomas Baker, who had been taken at Deerfield in 1704, and lived in Dover, where &s;he was born, till the year 1773.</P>
<P>Mr. John Emer&s;on, by declining to lodge at Major Waldron's on the fatal night, though &s;trongly urged, met with an happy e&s;cape. He was afterward a mini&s;ter at New-Ca&s;tle and Port&s;|mouth.</P>

<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of vigorous mea&s;ures was now &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, that parties were imme|diately di&s;patched, one under Captain Noyes to Penacook, where they de&s;troyed the corn, but the Indians e&s;caped; another from Pa&s;cataqua, under Captain Wincal, to Winnipi&s;eogee, whither the Indians had retired, as John Church, who had been ta|ken at Cochecho and e&s;caped from them, reported: One or two Indians were killed there, and their corn cut down.

<P>Nothing was more welcome to the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed inhabitants of the frontiers than the approach of winter, as they then expected a re&s;pite from their &s;ufferings.

This action which happened at an unu&s;ual time of the year, in the month of February, alarmed the whole country; and the ea&s;tern &s;ettlements were ordered to be on their guard.

<P>Oy&s;ter river is a &s;tream which runs into the we&s;tern branch of Pa&s;cataqua; the &s;ettlements were on both &s;ides of it, and the hou&s;es chiefly near the wa|ter. Here were twelve garri&s;oned hou&s;es &s;ufficient for the defence of the inhabitants, but apprehending no danger, &s;ome fami|lies remained at their own unfortified hou&s;es, and tho&s;e who were in the garri|&s;ons were but indifferently provided for defence &s;ome being even de&s;titute of pow|der. The enemy approached the place un|di&s;covered, and halted near the falls on Tue&s;day evening, the &s;eventeenth of July. Here they formed into two divi&s;ions, one of which was to go on each &s;ide of the river and plant them&s;elves in ambu&s;h, in &s;mall parties, near every hou&s;e, &s;o as to be ready for the attack at the ri&s;ing of the &s;un; the fir&s;t gun to be the &s;ignal. John Dean, who&s;e hou&s;e &s;tood by the &s;aw-mill at the falls, intending to go from home very early, aro&s;e before the dawn of day, and was &s;hot as he came out of his door. This firing, in part, di&s;concerted their plan; &s;everal parties who had &s;ome di&s;tance to go, had not then arrived at their &s;tations; the people in general were immediately
<PB N="271" REF="018344_0279_0FA5D4412E61E6C0">
alarmed, &s;ome of them had time to make their e&s;cape, and others to prepare for their defence. The &s;ignal being given, the attack began in all parts where the enemy was ready.</P>
<P>Of the twelve garri&s;oned hou&s;es five were de&s;troyed, viz. Adams's, Drew's, Edgerly's, Medar's and Beard's. They entered Adams's without re&s;i&s;tance, where they killed fourteen per&s;ons; one of them, being a woman with child, they ripped open. The grave is &s;till to be &s;een in which they were all buried. Drew &s;ur|rendered his garri&s;on on the promi&s;e of &s;ecurity, but was murdered when he fell into their hands; one of his children, a boy of nine years old, was made to run through a lane of Indians as a mark for them to throw their hatchets at, till they had di&s;patched him. Edgerly's was eva|cuated; the people took to their boat, and one of them was mortally wounded before they got out of reach of the enemy's &s;hot. Beard's and Medar's were al&s;o evacuated and the people e&s;caped.</P>
<P>The defencele&s;s hou&s;es were nearly all &s;et on fire, the inhabitants being either killed or taken in them, or el&s;e in endea|vouring to fly to the garri&s;ons. Some e&s;caped by hiding in the bu&s;hes and other

&s;ecret places. Thomas Edgerly, by con|cealing him&s;elf in his cellar, pre&s;erved his hou&s;e, though twice &s;et on fire. The hou&s;e of John Bu&s;s, the mini&s;ter, was de|&s;troyed with a valuable library. He was ab&s;ent, his wife and family fled to the woods and e&s;caped. The wife of John Dean, at whom the fir&s;t gun was fired was taken with her daughter, and carried about two miles up the river, where they were left under the care of an old Indian while the others returned to their bloody work. The Indian complained of a pain in his head, and a&s;ked the woman what would be a proper remedy: &s;he an&s;wered, Occapee, which is the Indian word for rum, of which &s;he knew he had taken a bottle from her hou&s;e. The remedy being agreeable, he took a large do&s;e and fell a&s;leep; and &s;he took that opportunity to make her e&s;cape, with her child, into the woods, and kept concealed till they were gone.</P>
<P>The other &s;even garri&s;ons, viz. Burn|ham's, Bickford's, Smith's, Bunker's, Davis's, Jones's and Woodman's were re|&s;olutely and &s;ucce&s;sfully defended. At Burnham's the gate was left open: The Indians, ten in number, who were ap|pointed to &s;urprize it, were a&s;leep under
<PB N="273" REF="018344_0281_0FA5D442E2FA6C08">
the bank of the river, at the time that the alarm was given. A man within, who had been kept awake by the tooth-ach, hearing the fir&s;t gun, rou&s;ed the people and &s;ecured the gate, ju&s;t as the Indians who were awakened by the &s;ame noi&s;e were entering. Finding them&s;elves di&s;|appointed, they ran to Pitman's, a defence|le&s;s hou&s;e, and forced the door at the mo|ment that he had bur&s;t a way through that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the hou&s;e which was next to the garri&s;on, to which he with his family, taking advantage of the &s;hade of &s;ome trees, it being moonlight, happily e&s;caped. Still defeated, they attacked the hou&s;e of John Davis, which after &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance he &s;urrendered on terms; but the terms were violated, and the whole family either killed or made captives. Thomas Bick|ford pre&s;erved his hou&s;e in a &s;ingular manner. It was &s;ituated near the river, and &s;urrounded with a pali&s;ade. Being alarmed before the enemy had reached the hou&s;e, he &s;ent off his family in a boat, and then &s;hutting his gate, betook him&s;elf alone to the defence of his fortre&s;s. De&s;pi&s;ing alike the promi&s;es and threats by which the Indians would have per&s;uaded him to &s;urrender, he kept up a con&s;tant fire at them, changing his dre&s;s as often as he

could, &s;hewing him&s;elf with a different cap, hat or coat, and &s;ometimes without either, and giving directions aloud as if he had a number of men with him. Finding their attempt vain, the enemy withdrew, and left him &s;ole ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e which he had defended with &s;uch admirable addre&s;s. Smith's, Bunker's, and Davis's garri&s;ons, being &s;ea&s;onably appriz|ed of the danger, were re&s;olutely defended, one Indian was &s;uppo&s;ed to be killed and another wounded by a &s;hot from Davis's Jones's garri&s;on was be&s;et before day; Capt. Jones hearing his dogs bark, and imagin|ing wolves might be near, went out to &s;ecure &s;ome &s;wine and returned unmole&s;ted. He then went up into the flankart and &s;at on the wall. Di&s;cerning the fla&s;h of a gun, he dropped backward; the ball entered the place from whence he had withdrawn his legs. The enemy from behind a rock kept firing on the hou&s;e for &s;ome time and then quitted it. During the&s;e tran&s;|actions the French prie&s;t took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the meeting-hou&s;e, and employed him&s;elf in writing on the pulpit with chalk; but the hou&s;e received no damage.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e parties of the enemy who were on the &s;outh &s;ide of the river having com|pleted their de&s;tructive work, collected in

a field adjoining to Burnham's garri&s;on, where they in&s;ultingly &s;hewed their pri|&s;oners, and derided the people, thinking them&s;elves out of reach of their &s;hot. A young man from the centry-box fired at one who was making &s;ome indecent &s;igns of defiance, and wounded him in the heel: Him they placed on a hor&s;e and carried away. Both divi&s;ions then met at the falls, where they had parted the evening before, and proceeded together to Capt. Wood|man's garri&s;on. The ground being un|even, they approached without danger, and from behind a hill kept up a long and &s;evere fire at the hats and caps which the people within held up on &s;ticks above the walls, without any other damage than galling the roof of the hou&s;e. At length, apprehending it was time for the people in the neighbouring &s;ettlements to be col|lected in pur&s;uit of them, they finally withdrew; having killed and captivated between ninety and an hundred per&s;ons, and burned about twenty hou&s;es, of which five were garri&s;ons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix with his u&s;ual parade boa&s;ts of their having killed two hundred and thirty people, and burned fifty or &s;ixty hou&s;es.

Waldron and his wife with their infant &s;on (afterward &s;ecretary) had almo&s;t &s;har|ed the &s;ame fate; they were taking boat to go and dine with this lady, when they were &s;topped by the arrival of &s;ome friends at their hou&s;e; while at dinner they were informed of her death.

<P>There is no mention of any more mi&s;|chief by the Indians within this province till the next year, when,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1695.</NOTE> in the month of July, two men were killed at Exeter.

On the twenty-&s;ixth of June an attack was made at Port&s;mouth plain, about two miles from the town. The enemy came from York-nubble to Sandy-beach in canoes, which they hid there among the bu&s;hes near the &s;hore. Some &s;u&s;picion was formed the day before by rea&s;on of the cattle running out of the
<PB N="278" REF="018344_0286_0FA5D44AE0C55FB0">
woods at Little-harbour; but fal&s;e alarms were frequent and this was not much re|garded. Early in the morning the attack was made on five hou&s;es at once; fourteen per&s;ons were killed on the &s;pot, one was &s;calped and left for dead, but recovered, and four were taken. The enemy having plundered the hou&s;es of what they could carry, &s;et them on fire, and made a pre|cipitate retreat through the great &s;wamp. A company of militia under Captain Shackford and Lieutenant Libbey pur&s;ued, and di&s;covered them cooking their break|fa&s;t, at a place ever &s;ince called Breakfa&s;t-hill. The Indians were on the farther &s;ide, having placed their captives between them|&s;elves and the top of the hill, that in ca&s;e of an attack they might fir&s;t receive the fire. The lieutenant urged to go round the hill, and come upon them below to cut off their retreat; but the captain fear|ing that in that ca&s;e they would, accord|ing to their cu&s;tom, kill the pri&s;oners, ru&s;hed upon them from the top of the hill, by which means they retook the captives and plunder, but the Indians, rolling down the hill, e&s;caped into the &s;wamp and got to their canoes. Another party, under another commander, was then &s;ent out in &s;hallops to intercept them as they &s;hould

It being a calm night the Indians were heard as they ad|vanced; but the captain, unhappily giving the word before they had come within gun-&s;hot, they tacked about to the &s;outh|ward, and going round the I&s;les of Shoals, by the favour of their light canoes e&s;caped. The watch-word was Crambo, which the captain ever after bore as an appendage to his title<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The account of this tran&s;action I had from the late Judge Parker, who had taken pains to pre&s;erve it.

<P>The next year on the tenth of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1697.</NOTE> the town of Exeter was remarkably pre|&s;erved from de&s;truction. A body of the enemy had placed them&s;elves near the town, intending to make an a&s;&s;ault in the morning of the next day. A number of women and children contrary to the advice of their friends went into the fields, with|out a guard, to gather &s;trawberries. When

they were gone &s;ome per&s;ons, to frighten them, fired an alarm; which quickly &s;pread through the town, and brought the people together in arms. The Indians &s;uppo&s;ing that they were di&s;covered, and quickened by fear, after killing one, wounding ano|ther, and taking a child, made a ha&s;ty re|treat and were &s;een no more there.

<P>The &s;ame year an inva&s;ion of the coun|try was projected by the French. A fleet was to &s;ail from France to Newfoundland and thence to Penob&s;cot, where being join|ed by an army from Canada, an attempt was to be made on Bo&s;ton, and the &s;ea|coa&s;t ravaged from thence to Pa&s;cataqua. The plan was too exten&s;ive and compli|cated to be executed in one &s;ummer. The fleet came no further than Newfoundland, when the advanced &s;ea&s;on, and &s;cantine&s;s of provi&s;ions obliged them to give over the de&s;ign. The people of New-England were apprized of the danger, and made the be&s;t preparations in their power. They &s;trengthened their fortifications on the coa&s;t, and rai&s;ed a body of men to de|fend

the frontiers again&s;t the Indians who were expected to c&ocirc;operate with the French. Some mi&s;chief was done by lurking parties at the ea&s;tward; but New-Hamp&s;hire was unmole&s;ted by them during the remainder of this, and the whole of the following year.</P>
<P>After the peace of Ry&s;wick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1698.</NOTE> Count Frontenac informed the Indians that he could not any longer &s;upport them in a war with the Engli&s;h, with whom his na|tion was now at peace. He therefore ad|vi&s;ed them to bury the hatchet and re&s;tore their captives. Having &s;uffered much by famine, and being divided in their opini|ons about pro&s;ecuting the war, after a long time they were brought to a treaty at Ca&s;co;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1699.</NOTE> where they ratified their former engagements;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Januar. 7.</NOTE> acknowledged &s;ubjection to the crown of England; lamented their former perfidy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mag. lib 7. p. 94.</NOTE> and promi&s;ed future peace and good behaviour in &s;uch terms as the commi&s;&s;ioners dictated, and with as much &s;incerity as could be expected. At the &s;ame time they re&s;tored tho&s;e captives who were able to travel from the places of their detention to Ca&s;co in that unfavourable &s;ea&s;on of the year; giving a&s;&s;urance for the return of the others in the &s;pring; but many of the younger &s;ort, both males and

females, were detained; who, mingling with the Indians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hutchin. vol. 2. p. 110.</NOTE> contributed to a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of enemies in future wars again&s;t their own country.</P>
<P>A general view of an Indian war will give a ju&s;t idea of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing times, and be a proper clo&s;e to this narration.</P>
<P>The Indians were &s;eldom or never &s;een before they did execution. They appear|ed not in the open field, nor gave proofs of a truly ma&s;culine courage; but did their exploits by &s;urprize, chiefly in the morn|ing, keeping them&s;elves hid behind logs and bu&s;hes, near the paths in the woods, or the fences contiguous to the doors of hou&s;es; and their lurking holes could be known only by the report of their guns, which was indeed but feeble, as they were &s;paring of ammunition, and as near as po&s;&s;ible to their object before they fired. They rarely a&s;&s;aulted an hou&s;e unle&s;s they knew there would be but little re&s;i&s;tance, and it has been afterward known that they have lain in ambu&s;h for days together, watching the motions of the people at their work, without daring to di&s;cover them&s;elves. One of their chiefs who had got a woman's riding-hood among his plunder would put it on, in an evening, and walk into the &s;treets of Port&s;mouth,
<PB N="283" REF="018344_0291_0FA5D44ED2CE83A0">
looking into the windows of hou&s;es and li&s;tening to the conver&s;ation of the people.</P>
<P>Their cruelty was chiefly exerci&s;ed upon children, and &s;uch aged, infirm, or cor|pulent per&s;ons as could not bear the hard|&s;hips of a journey through the wilderne&s;s. If they took a woman far advanced in pregnancy their knives were plunged into her b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wels. An infant when it became trouble&s;ome had its brains da&s;hed out a|gain&s;t the next tree or &s;tone. Sometimes to torment the wretched mother, they would whip and beat the child till almo&s;t dead, or hold it under water till its breath was ju&s;t gone, and then throw it to her to comfort and quiet it. If the mother could not readily &s;till its weeping, the hatchet was buried in its &s;kull. A captive weari|ed with his burden laid on his &s;houlders was often &s;ent to re&s;t the &s;ame way. If any one proved refractory, or was known to have been in&s;trumental of the death of an Indian, or related to one who had been &s;o, he was tortured with a lingering puni&s;h|ment, generally at the &s;take, while the other captives were in&s;ulted with the &s;ight of his mi&s;eries. Sometimes a fire would be kindled and a threatening given out again&s;t one or more, though there was no intention of &s;acrificing them, only to make
<PB N="284" REF="018344_0292_0FA5D45241E37988">
&s;port of their terrors. The young Indi|ans often &s;ignalized their cruelty in treat|ing captives inhumanly out of &s;ight of the elder, and when inquiry was made into the matter, the in&s;ulted captive mu&s;t either be &s;ilent or put the be&s;t face on it, to pre|vent wor&s;e treatment for the future. If a captive appeared &s;ad and dejected he was &s;ure to meet with in&s;ult; but if he could &s;ing and dance and laugh with his ma&s;ters, he was care&s;&s;ed as a brother.

<P>Famine was a common attendant on the&s;e doleful captivities; the Indians when they caught any game devoured it all at one &s;itting, and then girding them&s;elves round the wai&s;t, travelled without &s;u&s;te|nance till chance threw more in their way. The captives, unu&s;ed to &s;uch canine re|pa&s;ts and ab&s;tinences, could not &s;upport the &s;urfeit of the one nor the craving of the other. A change of ma&s;ters, though it &s;ometimes proved a relief from mi&s;ery, yet rendered the pro&s;pect of a return to their home more di&s;tant. If an Indian had lo&s;t a relative, a pri&s;oner bought for a gun, a hatchet, or a few &s;kins, mu&s;t &s;upply the place of the decea&s;ed, and be the father brother, or &s;on of the purcha&s;er; and tho&s;e

</ARGUMENT>
<P>JOHN U&s;her, E&s;quire, was a native of Bo&s;ton, and by profe&s;&s;ion a &s;tatione. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an hand&s;ome fortune, and &s;u&s;tained a fair character in trade. He had been employed by the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts government, when in England, to nego|ciate the purcha&s;e of the province of Maine, from the heirs of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, and had thereby got a ta&s;te for &s;peculating in landed intere&s;t. He was one of the partners in the million purcha&s;e, and had &s;anguine expectations of gain from that quarter. He had rendered him&s;elf unpo|pular among his coutrymen, by accepting the office of trea&s;urer, under Sir Edmund Andro&s;&s;e, and joining with apparent zeal in the mea&s;ures of that admini&s;tration, and he continued a friendly connexion with that party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">U&s;her's papers.</NOTE> after they were di&s;placed.</P>
<P>Though not illnatured, but rather of an open and generous di&s;po&s;ition, yet he
<PB N="289" REF="018344_0297_0FA5D45918EDAEF0">
wanted tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which he might have acquired by a learned and polite education. He was but little of the &s;tate&s;|man, and le&s;s of the courtier. In&s;tead of an engaging affability he affected a &s;everi|ty in his deportment, was loud in conver|&s;ation, and &s;tern in command. Fond of pre&s;iding in government, he frequently journied into the province, (though his re&s;idence was at Bo&s;ton, where he carried on his bu&s;ine&s;s as u&s;ual,) and often &s;um|moned the council when he had little or nothing to lay before them. He gave or|ders, and found fault like one who felt him&s;elf independent, and was determined to be obeyed. He had an high idea of his authority and the dignity of his com|mi&s;&s;ion, and when oppo&s;ed and in&s;ulted, as he &s;ometimes was, he treated the of|fenders with a &s;everity which he would not relax till he had brought them to &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. His public &s;peeches were al|ways incorrect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Province files.</NOTE> and &s;ometimes coar&s;e and reproachful.</P>
<P>He &s;eems, however, to have taken as much care for the intere&s;t and pre&s;ervation of the province as one in his circum&s;tan|ces could have done. He began his ad|mini&s;tration in the height of a war which greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and impoveri&s;hed the

The rea&s;on why the commonalty of the people do not agree is becau&s;e 3 or 4 of the great landed men di&s;&s;uade them from it. The people have petitioned the king to be an|nexed to Bo&s;ton government, but it will not be for the proprie|tor's intere&s;t to admit of that unle&s;s the king &s;ends a general governor over all.</Q></NOTE>. The people perceived the&s;e views, and were aware of the danger. The tran&s;fer of the title from Ma&s;on to Allen was only a change of names: They expected a repetition of the &s;ame difficul|ties under a new claimant. After the op|po&s;ition they had hitherto made, it could not be thought &s;trange that men who&s;e pul&s;e beat high for freedom, &s;hould refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to va&s;&s;alage; nor, while they were on one &s;ide defending their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions again&s;t a &s;avage enemy, could it be ex|pected, that on the other, they &s;hould tamely &s;uffer the intru&s;ion of a landlord. U&s;her's intere&s;t was united with theirs in providing for the defence of the country, and contending with the enemy; but when the propriety of the &s;oil was in que&s;|tion, they &s;tood on oppo&s;ite &s;ides; and as both the&s;e controver&s;ies were carried on at the &s;ame time, the conduct of the peo|ple toward him varied according to the

They had petitioned to be re-annexed to them, at the time of the revolution; and they were always very fond of applying to them for help in their difficulties, that it might appear how un|able they were to &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone. They knew al&s;o that the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts people were as aver&s;e as them&s;elves from Allen's claim, which extended to a great part of their lands, and was particularly noticed in their new charter.</P>

Captain John Pickering, a man of a rough and adventurous &s;pirit, and a lawyer, had gone with a company of armed men to the hou&s;e of Chamberlayne, the late &s;ecre|tary and clerk, and demanded the records and files which were in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Chamberlayne refu&s;ed to deliver them without &s;ome legal warrant or &s;ecurity; but Pickering took them by force, and conveyed them over the river to Kittery. Pickering was &s;ummoned before the go|vernor, threatened and impri&s;oned, but for &s;ometime would neither deliver the books, nor di&s;cover the place of their conceal|ment, unle&s;s by order of the a&s;&s;embly and to &s;ome per&s;on by them appointed to re|ceive them.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1693.</NOTE>Another favourite point with U&s;her was to have the boundary between New-Hamp&s;hire and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts a&s;certained: There were rea&s;ons which induced &s;ome of the people to fall in with this de&s;ire. The general idea was, that New-Hamp&s;hire began at the end of three miles north of the river Merrimack; which imaginary line was al&s;o the boundary of the adjoin|ing town&s;hips on each &s;ide. The people
<PB N="293" REF="018344_0301_0FA5D28E2B8576D8">
who lived, and owned lands near the&s;e li|mits, pretended to belong to either pro|vince, as be&s;t &s;uited their conveniency; which cau&s;ed a difficulty in the collecting taxes, and cutting timber. The town of Hampton was &s;en&s;ibly affected with the&s;e difficulties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1695.</NOTE> and petitioned the council that the line might be run.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Octob. 12.</NOTE> The council ap|pointed a committee of Hampton men to do it, and gave notice to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts of their intention;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. files.</NOTE> de&s;iring them to join in the affair. They di&s;liked it and declin|ed to act.

<P>The only attempt made to extend the &s;ettlement of the lands during the&s;e times, was that in the &s;pring of the year 1694, while there was a truce with the Indians. U&s;her granted a charter for the town&s;hip of King&s;ton to about twenty petitioners from Hampton. They were &s;oon di&s;|couraged by the dangers and difficulties of the &s;ucceeding ho&s;tilities, and many of them returned home within two years. After the war they re&s;umed their enter|prize;
<PB N="294" REF="018344_0302_0FA5D28EDB8F30E8">
but it was not till the year 1725, that they were able to obtain the &s;ettlement of a mini&s;ter. No other alterations took place in the old towns, except the &s;epara|tion of Great I&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1693.</NOTE> Little Harbour, and Sandy Beach, from Port&s;mouth, and their erection into a town by the name of New-ca&s;tle; together with the annexation of that part of Squam&s;cot patent which now bears the name of Stretham, to Exeter, it having before been connected with Hampton.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. files.</NOTE></P>
<P>The lieutenant-governor was very for|ward in the&s;e tran&s;actions, thinking them circum&s;tances favourable to his views, and being willing to recommend him&s;elf to the people by &s;econding their wi&s;hes &s;o far as was con&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;t he meaned to &s;erve. The people, however, regarded the &s;ettling and dividing of town&s;hips, and the running of lines, only as matters of general convenience, and continued to be di&s;gu&s;ted with his admini&s;tration. His re|peated calls upon them for money were an&s;wered by repeated pleas of poverty, and reque&s;ts for a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the neigh|bouring province. U&s;her u&s;ed all his in|fluence with that government to obtain a &s;upply of men to garri&s;on the frontiers; and when they wanted provi&s;ions for the

<P>For the two or three fir&s;t years of his admini&s;tration the public charges were provided for as they had been before, by an exci&s;e on wines and other &s;pirituous liquors, and an impo&s;t on merchandize. The&s;e duties being laid only from year to year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1695.</NOTE> U&s;her vehemently urged upon the a&s;&s;embly a renewal of the act, and an ex|ten&s;ion of the duty to articles of export;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 7 &amp; 9.</NOTE> and that a part of the money &s;o rai&s;ed might be applied to the &s;upport of govern|ment. The an&s;wer he obtained was, that
<Q>con&s;idering the expo&s;ed &s;tate of the pro|vince, they were obliged to apply all the money they could rai&s;e to their defence; and therefore they were not capable of doing any thing for the &s;upport of go|vernment, though they were &s;en&s;ible his honour had been at con&s;iderable ex|pence: They begged that he would join with the council in repre&s;enting to the king the poverty and danger of the pro|vince, that &s;uch methods might be taken for their &s;upport and pre&s;ervation as to the royal wi&s;dom &s;hould &s;eem meet.</Q>
Being further pre&s;&s;ed upon the &s;ubject,

The prin|cipal de&s;ign of this me&s;&s;age was to make their court to the earl, and get the &s;tart of U&s;her or any of his friends who might prepo&s;&s;e&s;s him with an opinion to their di&s;advantage. But if this &s;hould have hap|pened, Plai&s;ted was directed

and he was furni&s;hed with a letter of credit to defray his expences. This me&s;&s;age, which &s;hews the contrivers to be no mean politicians, had the de&s;ired effect.</P>

<P>The &s;ame day Coffin and Weare mov|ed a que&s;tion in council, whether U&s;her was one of that body. He a&s;&s;erted his privilege, and obtained a major vote. They then entered their di&s;&s;ent, and de|&s;ired a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. The governor forbad their departure.

pacific and conde&s;cending di&s;po&s;ition. The &s;ame ill temper continued during the remainder of this &s;hort admini&s;tration. The old coun&s;ellors, excepting Fryar, re|fu&s;ed to &s;it. Samp&s;on Sheaffe and Peter Weare made up the quorum. Sheaffe was al&s;o &s;ecretary, Smith trea&s;urer, and William Ardell &s;heriff.

<P>In the &s;pring the earl of Bellomont &s;et out for his ea&s;tern governments. The council voted an addre&s;s, and &s;ent a com|mittee, of which U&s;her was one, to pre|&s;ent it to him at Bo&s;ton; and preparations were made for his reception in New-Hamp|&s;hire;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 31.</NOTE> where he at length came and pub|li&s;hed his commi&s;&s;ion to the great joy of the people, who now &s;aw at the head of the government a nobleman of di&s;tingui&s;h|ed figure and polite manners, a firm friend to the revolution, a favourite of King Wil|liam, and one who had no intere&s;t in op|pre&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<P>During the controver&s;y with Allen, Par|tridge had withdrawn; but upon this change he took his &s;eat as lieutenant-go|vernor,
<PB N="305" REF="018344_0313_0FA5D29C5A91B260">
and the di&s;placed coun&s;ellors were again called to the board. A petiti|on was pre&s;ented again&s;t the judges of the &s;uperior court, and a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued for ju&s;tices of the peace and con&s;ta|bles only to continue in office, whereby the judges commi&s;&s;ions determined. Rich|ard Jo&s;e was made &s;heriff in the room of Ardell, and Charles Story &s;ecretary in the room of Sheaffe.</P>
<P>The government was now modelled in favour of the people, and they rejoiced in the change, as they apprehended the way was opened for an effectual &s;ettlement of their long continued difficulties and di&s;|putes. Both parties laid their complaints before the governor, who wi&s;ely avoided cen&s;uring either, and advi&s;ed to a revival of the courts of ju&s;tice, in which the main controver&s;y might be legally decided. This was agreed to, and the nece&s;&s;ary acts be|ing pa&s;&s;ed by an a&s;&s;embly, (who al&s;o pre|&s;ented the earl with five hundred pounds which he obtained the king's leave to ac|cept) after about eighteen days &s;tay he quitted the province, leaving Partridge, now quietly &s;eated in the chair, to appoint the judges of the re&s;pective courts. Hinckes was made chief ju&s;tice of the &s;uperior court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Council Records.</NOTE> with Peter Co&s;&s;in, John Gerri&s;h and John

<P>One principal object of the earl's atten|tion was to fortify the harbour, and pro|vide for the defence of the country in ca&s;e of another war. He had recommended to the a&s;&s;embly in his &s;peech the building a &s;trong fort on Great I&s;land, and after|ward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1700.</NOTE> in his letters, a&s;&s;ured them that if they would provide materials, he would endeavour to prevail on the king to be at the expence of erecting it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 6.</NOTE> Col.

To invalidate the evidence of the title produced on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, it was pleaded, That the alledged grant from the council of Plymouth to Ma&s;on in 1629, was not &s;igned; that livery and &s;eizin were not endor&s;ed on it as on other of their grants, and as was then the legal form; nor was it ever enrolled according to &s;tatute: That the &s;ale of part of the &s;ame lands in 1628 to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts company, by an in&s;trument &s;igned and executed according to law, renders this &s;ub&s;equent grant &s;u&s;picious; and that his pretending to procure another grant of part of the &s;ame lands in 1635, was an argu|ment that he him&s;elf could not rely on the preceding one, nor was it credible that the &s;ame council &s;hould grant the &s;ame lands twice, and to the &s;ame per&s;on: That the alledged grant in 1635 was equally de|fective; and that he mu&s;t relinqui&s;h one or the other, it being contrary to the rea|&s;on and u&s;age of law to rely on two &s;eve|ral

titles at once. It was urged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1703.</NOTE> That Waldron's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was grounded on a deed from the native lords of the &s;oil, with whom his father had endeavoured to cultivate a friendly connexion; that he had taken up his land with their con&s;ent, when the country was a wilderne&s;s; had cultivated it, had defended it in war at a great expence, and at the hazard of his life, which he finally lo&s;t in the attempt; that the Indian deed was legally executed in the pre&s;ence of the factors and agents of the company of Laconia, of which Ma|&s;on was one; that this was done with the toleration of the council of Plymouth, and in pur&s;uance of the great ends of their incorporation, which were to cultivate the lands, to people the country and chri&s;tian|ize the natives, for the honour and intere&s;t of the crown and the trade of England, all which ends had been pur&s;ued and at|tained by the appellee and his ance&s;tor. It was al&s;o alledged, that the writ again&s;t Major Waldron in 1683 was for
"lands and tenements,"
of which the quantity, &s;ituation and bounds were not de&s;cribed, for want of which no legal judgment could be given; that no execution had ever been levied, nor was the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or ever di&s;turbed or amoved by rea&s;on thereof; and that

the copies produced were not atte&s;ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1707.</NOTE> no book of records being to be found.

<P>As to the motion for a &s;pecial verdict, it was &s;aid that a jury could not find one, if they had no doubt of the law or fact, for the rea&s;on of a &s;pecial verdict is a doubt either in point of law or evidence; nor was it con&s;i&s;tent with the privileges of Engli&s;h|men that a jury &s;hould be <HI>compelled</HI> to find &s;pecially. In addition to the&s;e pleas it was further alledged, that by the &s;tatute law no action of ejectment can be main|tained except the plaintiff, or tho&s;e under whom he claims, have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion within twenty years; and if they have

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The war with the French and Indians, called Queen Anne's war. Conclu&s;ion of Dudley's and U&s;her's admini&s;tration.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE peace which followed the treaty of Ry&s;wick was but of &s;hort duration, for the &s;eeds of war were ready &s;own both in Europe and America. Louis had proclaim|ed the pretender king of England, and his Governor Villebon had orders to extend his province of Acadia to the river Kennebeck, though the Engli&s;h court under&s;tood St. Croix to be the boundary between their territories and tho&s;e of the French The fi&s;hery was interrupted by French men of war, and by the orders of Villebon, who &s;uffered no Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els to fi&s;h on the banks of Nova-Scotia. A French mi&s;&s;ion was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and a chapel erected at Norridgwog, on the upper part of Kenne|beck, which &s;erved to extend the influence of the French among the Indians. The governor of Canada, a&s;&s;uming the cha|racter of their father and protector, in|&s;tigated them to prevent the &s;ettlement of the Engli&s;h to the ea&s;t of Kennebeck, and found &s;ome among them ready to li&s;ten

to his advice. The people in tho&s;e parts were apprehen&s;ive of danger and meditat|ing a removal, and tho&s;e who had enter|tained thoughts of &s;ettling there were re|&s;trained.</P>
<P>Things were in this po&s;ture when Dud|ley entered on his government. He had particular orders from England to rebuild the fort at Pemaquid; but could not pre|vail on the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts a&s;&s;embly to bear the expence of it. However he determin|ed on a vi&s;it to the ea&s;tern country, and having notified his intention to the Indians, took with him a number of gentlemen of both his provinces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hutchin&s;on has mi&s;placed this tran&s;action by a year.</NOTE>, and held a conference at Ca&s;co with delegates from the tribes of Norridgwog,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1703.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="marg">June 20.</NOTE> Penob&s;cot, Pigwacket, Pena|cook and Amari&s;coggin; who a&s;&s;ured him that
<Q>as high as the &s;un was above the earth, &s;o far di&s;tant was their de&s;ign of making the lea&s;t breach of the peace.</Q>
They pre|&s;ented him a belt of wampum in token of their &s;incerity, and both parties went to two heaps of &s;tones which had formerly been pitched and called the <HI>Two Brothers,</HI> where the friend&s;hip was further ratified by the addition of other &s;tones. They al|&s;o declared, that although the French emi&s;|&s;aries among them had been endeavouring
<PB N="331" REF="018344_0339_0FA5D2BC9E8BA808">
to break the union, yet it was

Notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e fair appearances, it was ob&s;erved that when the Indians fired a &s;alute their guns were charged with &s;hot; and it was &s;u&s;pected that they had then formed a de|&s;ign to &s;eize the governor and his atten|dants, if a party which they expected from Canada, and which arrived two or three days after, had come in proper &s;ea&s;on to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

<P>The next week (Augu&s;t 17) a party of thirty Indians under Captain Tom killed five people at Hampton village; among whom was a widow Mu&s;&s;y, a noted &s;peak|er among the friends, and much lamented by them; they, al&s;o plundered two hou&s;es; but the people being alarmed, and pur&s;u|ing them, they fled.</P>

<P>The next &s;ummer was chiefly &s;pent in negotiating an exchange of pri&s;oners; and Dudley had the addre&s;s to protract the ne|gotiation, under pretence of con&s;ulting with the other governments about a neu|trality propo&s;ed by the governor of Cana|da, by which means the frontiers in ge|neral were kept tolerably quiet, although the enemy appeared once or twice in the town of Kittery.

<P>During this truce, the inhabitants of King&s;ton who had left the place, were en|couraged to petition for leave to return to their lands; which the court granted on condition that they &s;hould build a fort in the center of the town, lay out a par&s;on|age

<P>The governor of Canada had encourag|ed the Indians who inhabited the borders of New-England to remove to Canada, where being incorporated with the tribe of St. Francis, they have ever &s;ince re|mained. By this policy they became more firmly attached to the intere&s;t of the French, and were more ea&s;ily di&s;patched on their bloody bu&s;ine&s;s to the frontiers of New-England, with which they were well ac|quainted. Dudley, who was generally apprized of their movements, and kept a vigilant eye upon them, apprehended a rup|ture in the winter; and gave orders for a cir|cular &s;couting march, once a month, round the head of the towns from King&s;ton to Sal|mon falls;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1706.</NOTE> but the enemy did not appear till April; when a &s;mall party of them attacked the hou&s;e of John Drew at Oy&s;ter river, where they killed eight and wound|ed two. The garri&s;on was near, but not a man in it: the women, however, &s;eeing nothing but death before them, fired an alarm, and then putting on hats, and loo&s;ening their hair that they might ap|pear like men, they fired &s;o bri&s;kly that the enemy, apprehending the people were
<PB N="339" REF="018344_0347_0FA5D2C7E38D97D0">
alarmed, fled without burning or even plundering the hou&s;e which they had at|tacked. John Wheeler, meeting this par|ty and mi&s;taking them for friendly Indians, unhappily fell into their hands and was killed with his wife and two children. Four of his &s;ons took refuge in a cave by the bank of the Little Bay, and though pur&s;ued by the Indians e&s;caped unhurt.</P>
<P>In July Colonel Schuyler from Albany gave notice to Dudley that two hundred and &s;eventy of the enemy were on their march toward Pa&s;cataqua, of which he im|mediately informed the people, and or|dered them to clo&s;e garri&s;on, and one half of the militia to be ready at a minute's warning. The fir&s;t appearance of this body of the enemy was at Dun&s;table; from whence they proceeded to Ame&s;bury and King&s;ton, where they killed &s;ome cat|tle. Hilton with &s;ixty four men march|ed from Exeter; but was obliged to re|turn without meeting the enemy. The rea&s;on he gave to the council for return|ing &s;o &s;oon was the want of provi&s;ion, there being none in readine&s;s at the gar|ri&s;ons, notwith&s;tanding a law lately enact|ed, enjoining it on every town to have &s;tores ready and depo&s;ited in the hands of their captains. For the &s;ame rea&s;on he had
<PB N="340" REF="018344_0348_0FA5D2C89F23CD40">
been obliged to di&s;continue a &s;mall &s;cout which he had for &s;ome time kept up. Hilton was &s;o brave and active an officer that the enemy had marked him for de|&s;truction; and for this purpo&s;e a party of them kept lurking about his hou&s;e, where they ob&s;erved ten men to go out one morn|ing with their &s;cythes, and lay a&s;ide their arms to mow; they then crept between the men and their guns, and &s;uddenly ru&s;hing on them, killed four, wounded one, and took three; two only of the whole number e&s;caped. They mi&s;&s;ed the major for this time, and two of their pri&s;oners e&s;caped; but &s;uffered much in their re|turn, having nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on for three weeks but lily roots and the rinds of trees. After this they killed William Pearl and took Nathaniel Tibbets at Dover.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t 10.</NOTE> It was ob&s;erved during this war that the ene|my did more damage in &s;mall bodies than in larger, and by &s;cattering along the frontiers kept the people in continual ap|prehen&s;ion and alarm; and &s;o very few of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fell into our hands, that in comput|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> the expence of the war it was judged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> every Indian killed or taken co&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ntry a thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>In the following winter Hilton made another excur&s;ion to the ea&s;tward, and a

&s;hallop was &s;ent to Ca&s;co with &s;tores and provi&s;ions for his party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1707.</NOTE> con&s;i&s;ting of two hundred and twenty men. The winter being mild, and the weather un&s;ettled, pre|vented their marching &s;o far as they in|tended: cold dry weather and deep &s;now being mo&s;t favourable to winter expediti|ons. However they came on an Indian track near Black Point, and pur&s;uing it, killed four, and took a &s;quaw who con|ducted them to a party of eighteen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 21.</NOTE> whom they &s;urprized as they lay a&s;leep on a neck of land at break of day, and of whom they killed &s;eventeen and took the other. This was matter of triumph con&s;idering the dif|ficulty of finding their haunts. It was remarked that on the very morning that this affair happened it was reported, with but little variation from the truth, at Port&s;|mouth though at the di&s;tance of &s;ixty miles.</P>
<P>When Church went to Nova-Scotia he very earne&s;tly &s;olicited leave to make an attempt on Port Royal; but Dudley would not con&s;ent, and the rea&s;on he gave was, that he had written to the mini&s;try in England and expected orders and naval help to reduce the place. His enemies however a&s;&s;igned another rea&s;on for his refu&s;al; which was that a clande&s;tine trade was carried on by his connivance, and to his

To wipe off the&s;e a&s;per&s;ions he now determined to make an attack in earne&s;t on Port Royal, even though no a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould come from England. It was intended that an armament &s;hould be &s;ent to America, and the commander was appointed; but the &s;tate of affairs in Europe prevented their coming.</P>
<P>Early in the &s;pring the governor appli|ed to the a&s;&s;emblies of both his provinces, and to the colonies of Rhode I&s;land and Connecticut, reque&s;ting them to rai&s;e one thou&s;and men for the expedition.

<Q>general orders were given at Port Royal for every man to make the be&s;t of his way home.</Q>
The governor, highly chagrined and very angry, &s;ent orders from Bo&s;ton that if any more ve&s;&s;els arrived the men &s;hould not be permitted to come on &s;hore "on pain of death." After a while he ordered Che&s;ley's com|pany to be collected and reimbarked, offering a pardon to tho&s;e who voluntari|ly returned, the re&s;t to be &s;everely puni&s;hed. By the latter end of July they got on board,
<PB N="344" REF="018344_0352_0FA5D2CC576B7FA8">
and with the re&s;t of the army, returned to the place of action. At the landing, an ambu&s;cade of Indians from among the &s;edge on the top of a &s;ea-wall, greatly an|noyed the troops. Major Walton and Captain Che&s;ley, being then on &s;hore with the New-Hamp&s;hire companies, pu&s;hed their men up the beach, flanked the ene|my, and after an ob&s;tinate &s;truggle put them to flight.

in view was a de&s;ire of wiping off the di&s;|grace of a former year by an attempt, not on Port Royal, but on Canada it&s;elf. For this purpo&s;e &s;olicitations had been made in England by Francis Nichol&s;on, E&s;q. who had been lieutenant-governor of Vir|ginia, and Captain Samuel Vetch a trader to Nova-Scotia, who was well acquainted with the French &s;ettlements there, and made a full repre&s;entation of the &s;tate of things in America to the Briti&s;h mini&s;try.

The people of New-Hamp&s;hire were &s;o much exhau&s;ted, and their men had been &s;o ill paid before, that it was with great difficulty, and not without the di&s;&s;olution of one a&s;&s;embly and the calling of another, that they could rai&s;e money to levy one hundred men and procure two tran&s;ports for conveying them. After the utmo&s;t exertions had been made by the &s;e|veral governments, and Nichol&s;on with part of the troops had marched to Wood

creek, and the re&s;t with the tran&s;ports had lain at Nanta&s;ket three months wait|ing for a fleet, news arrived that the ar|mament promi&s;ed from England was di|verted to another quarter. Upon which the commander of the frigates on the Bo&s;|ton &s;tation refu&s;ed to convoy the troops, the whole army was di&s;banded, and the expence the colonies had been at was fruit|le&s;s. A congre&s;s of governors and dele|gates from the a&s;&s;emblies met in the fall at Rhode-I&s;land, who recommended the &s;ending home agents to a&s;&s;i&s;t Colonel Ni|chol&s;on in repre&s;enting the &s;tate of the country, and &s;oliciting an expedition again&s;t Canada the next &s;pring.

<P>While this expedition was in hand, and before the appointment of the command|ers, New-Hamp&s;hire &s;u&s;tained an heavy lo&s;s in the death of Col. Winthrop Hilton. This worthy officer being concerned in the ma&s;ting bu&s;ine&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 22.</NOTE> and having &s;everal large trees felled about fourteen miles from home, went out with a party to peel the bark that the wood might not be injured by worms. While engaged in this bu&s;ine&s;s they were ambu&s;hed by a party of Indians, who at the fir&s;t fire killed Hilton with two more, and took two; the re&s;t being terri|fied, and their guns being wet, made no oppo&s;ition, but e&s;caped. The next day one hundred men marched in pur&s;uit but di&s;covered only the mangled bodies of the dead. The enemy in their barbarous tri|umph had &s;truck their hatchets into the colonel's brains, and left a lance in his heart. He was a gentleman

and was buried with the honours due to his rank and character.</P>
<P>Flu&s;hed with this &s;ucce&s;s, they in&s;olent|ly appeared in the open road at Exeter, and took four children who were at their play. They al&s;o took John Wedgwood, and killed John Magoon near his brother's barn, a place which for three days he had vi&s;ited with a melancholy apprehen&s;ion ari&s;ing from a dream that he &s;hould there be murdered.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day that Hilton was killed, a company of Indians who had pretended friend&s;hip, who the year before had been peaceably conver&s;ant with the inhabitants of King&s;ton, and &s;eemed to be thir&s;ting after the blood of the enemy, came into the town, and ambu&s;hing the road, killed Samuel Win&s;low and Samuel Huntoon; they al&s;o took Philip Huntoon and Jacob Gilman, and carried them to Canada;<NOTE PLACE="marg">MS Letter of Ward Clark to Prince.</NOTE> where, after &s;ome time, they purcha&s;ed their own redemption by building a &s;aw|mill for the governor after the Engli&s;h mode.</P>
<P>The la&s;t that fell this &s;ummer was Ja|cob Garland, who was killed at Cochecho on his return from the public wor&s;hip. As the winter approached, Colonel Walton with one hundred and &s;eventy men traver&s;|ed the ea&s;tern &s;hores, which the Indians
<PB N="352" REF="018344_0360_0FA5D2D7730CE8A0">
u&s;ually vi&s;ited at this &s;ea&s;on for the pur|po&s;e of gathering clams. On an I&s;land where the party was encamped, &s;everal Indians decoyed by their &s;moke, and mi&s;|taking them for &s;ome of their own tribe, came among them and were made pri&s;o|ners. One of them was a &s;achem of Nor|ridgwog, active, bold and &s;ullen; when he found him&s;elf in the hands of ene|mies he would an&s;wer none of their que&s;ti|ons, and laughed with &s;corn at their threatening him with death. His wife, be|ing an eye witne&s;s of the execution of the threatening, was &s;o intimidated as to make the di&s;coveries which the captors had in vain de&s;ired of the &s;achem; in con&s;e|quence of which three were taken at the place of which &s;he informed, and two more at Saco river, where al&s;o five were killed. This &s;ucce&s;s, incon&s;iderable as it may ap|pear, kept up the &s;pirits of the people, and added to the lo&s;s of the enemy who were daily dimini&s;hing by &s;ickne&s;s and famine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1711.</NOTE>In the &s;pring they renewed their ra|vages on the frontiers in &s;mall parties. Thomas Downs, John Church, and three more were killed at Cochecho; and on a &s;abbath day &s;everal of the people there fell into an ambu&s;h as they were returning from public wor&s;hip. John Horn was wound|ed,

and Humphry Fo&s;s was taken; but, by the determined bravery of Lieutenant Heard, he was recovered out of the hands of the enemy. Walton with two compa|nies marched to the ponds about the fi&s;h|ing &s;ea&s;on; but the Indians had withdrawn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penhallow p. 60.</NOTE> and nothing was to be &s;een but their de|&s;erted wigwams.</P>
<P>After the reduction of Port Royal Ni|chol&s;on went to England to &s;olicit an ex|pedition again&s;t Canada. The tory mini|&s;try of Queen Anne, to the &s;urprize of all the whigs in England and America, fell in with the propo&s;al; and on the eighth of June Nichol&s;on came to Bo&s;ton with orders for the northern colonies to get ready their quotas of men and provi&s;ion by the arrival of the fleet and army from Europe; which happened within &s;ixteen days; and while the &s;everal governors were holding a con&s;ultation on the &s;ubject of their orders. A compliance with them in &s;o &s;hort a time was impo&s;&s;ible; yet eve|ry thing that could be done was done; the nature of the &s;ervice con&s;piring with the wi&s;hes of the people, made the go|vernments exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t. New-Hamp&s;hire rai&s;ed one hundred men, which was more than they could well &s;pare; one half of the militia being con|tinually

employed in guarding the fron|tiers. They al&s;o voted them &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for one hundred and twenty &s;ix days, be|&s;ides providing for them on &s;hore before their embarkation. Two tran&s;ports were taken up at eight &s;hillings per month per ton; and artillery &s;tores were i&s;&s;ued from the fort. The colony forces formed two regiments under the command of Vetch and Walton. The army which came from England were &s;even veteran regiments of the Duke of Marlborough's army, and a battalion of marines, under the command of Brigadier-General Hill, which, joined with the New-England troops made a bo|dy of about &s;ix thou&s;and five hundred men, provided with a fine train of artillery. The fleet con&s;i&s;ted of fifteen &s;hips of war from eighty to thirty-&s;ix guns, with forty tran&s;ports and &s;ix &s;tore&s;hips under the com|mand of Admiral Walker.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penhallow p. 64.

<PB N="355" REF="018344_0363_0FA5D2DA295C9B98">
&s;ucce&s;s which had been entertained by the nation and the colonies were all blamed in one fatal night. For, the fleet having ad|vanced ten leagues into the river St. Law|rence, in the night of the twenty third of Augu&s;t, the weather being thick and dark, eight tran&s;ports were wrecked on Egg-I&s;land near the north &s;hore, and one thou|&s;and people peri&s;hed; among whom there was but one man who belonged to New-England. The next day the fleet put back, and were eight days beating down the ri|ver again&s;t an ea&s;terly wind which would in two days have carried them to Quebec. After rendezvou&s;ing at Spani&s;h river in the i&s;land of Cape Breton, and holding a fruitle&s;s con&s;ultation about annoying the French at Placentia, the expedition was broken up: the fleet returned to England, and the New-England troops to their homes. Loud complaints and heavy charges were made on this occa&s;ion; the ignorance of the pilots; the ob&s;tinacy of the admi|ral; the detention of the fleet at Bo&s;ton; its late arrival there; the want of &s;ea&s;on|able orders;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dummer's defence &amp; letter to a noble lord.</NOTE> and the &s;ecret intentions of the mini&s;try, were all &s;ubjects of bitter al|tercation: but the mi&s;carriage was never regularly enquired into,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Octob. 9.</NOTE> and the voyage was finally &s;ettled by the blowing up of

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1712.</NOTE>The failure of this expedition encou|raged the Indians to harra&s;s the frontiers as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on would permit.

A &s;couting party who went up the river Merrimack had the good for|tune to &s;urprize and kill eight Indians and recover a con&s;iderable quantity of plunder, without the lo&s;s of a man. The frontiers were well guarded; one half of the mili|tia did duty at the garri&s;ons and were ready to march at a minute's warning; a &s;cout of forty men kept ranging on the heads of the towns, and the like care was taken by &s;ea, &s;py-boats being employed in coa&s;ting from Cape Neddock to the Great Boar's-head. Notwith&s;tanding this vigilance, &s;mall parties of the enemy were frequently &s;een.

two children of John Waldron were tak|en, and for want of time to &s;calp them, their heads were cut off.

<P>In autumn the news of the peace of Utrecht arrived in America; and on the 29th of October the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms was proclaimed at Port&s;mouth. The Indians being informed of this event came in with a flag of truce to Captain Moody at Ca&s;co, and de&s;ired a treaty; which the governor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1713.</NOTE> with the council of each province, held at Port&s;mouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 11.</NOTE> where the chiefs and deputies of the &s;everal belli|gerent tribes, by a formal writing under hand and &s;eal, acknowledged their perfidy, promi&s;ed fidelity, renewed their allegiance, &s;ubmitted to the laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penhallow p. 72, 80.</NOTE> and begged the queen's pardon for their former mi&s;car|riages. The frequent repetition of &s;uch engagements and as frequent violations of them, had by this time much abated the &s;en&s;e of obligation on the one part, and of confidence on the other.

<P>During the whole of this long war, U&s;her behaved as a faithful &s;ervant of the crown; frequently coming into the province by Dudley's direction, and &s;ometimes re&s;id|ing in it &s;everal months, enquiring into the &s;tate of the frontiers and garri&s;ons, vi|&s;iting them in per&s;on, con&s;ulting with the officers of militia about the proper me|thods of defence and protection, and of|fering his &s;ervice on all occa&s;ions: Yet his au&s;tere and ungracious manners, and the intere&s;t he had in Allen's claim, effec|tually prevented him from acquiring that popularity which he &s;eems to have de&s;erv|ed. He was &s;olicitous to &s;upport the dig|nity of his commi&s;&s;ion; but could never prevail with the a&s;&s;embly to &s;ettle a &s;alary upon him.

<P>Dudley had the good fortune to be more popular.

One of the&s;e ad|dre&s;&s;es was in one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ix, and another in one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;even, in both which they re|pre&s;ent him as a "prudent, careful and faith|ful governor," and &s;ay they

<P>RIGHT honourable, right wor&s;hippful and the re&s;t, my humble &s;ervis rembred. Your letter dated the 5th of December and Mr. Ares letter the third of April I received the &s;eventh of June. The detaining of the former letter hath put you to a great charge in the plantation. For my care and paines I have not thought it much although I have had very little encouradgement from you and here. I do not doubt of your good will unto mee. For your fi&s;hing, you complain of Mr. Gibbes: A Londoner is not for fi&s;hing, neither is there any amity betwixt the We&s;t cuntrimen and them. Bri&s;to or Barn&s;table is very convenient for your fi&s;hing &s;hipes. It is not enough to &s;it out &s;hipes to fi&s;h but they mu&s;t be &s;ure (God wil) to be at their fi&s;hing place the beginning of February and not to come to the land when other men have half their viage.</P>

For my &s;ettlement at Sanders-Point and the further good you in|tend me I humbly thank you I &s;hall do the be&s;t I can to be grateful. I have taken into my handes all the trade goods that remains of John Raymon's and Mr. Vaughan's and will with what convenience I may put them of. <HI>You complain of

Bounded as followeth, viz. Port&s;mouth runes from the harbor's mouth by the &s;ea &s;ide to the entrance of a little river between two hed lands which we have given the names of the Little Bore's-hed, and the Grete Bore's-hed, and from the mouth of that little river to go on a &s;trait line to the afore&s;aid creeke which we have named Weelewrights creeke and from thens down the river to the harbor's mouth where it began. And North-ham is the bounds of all the land of Hilton's Point &s;ide. And the other land from the little river between the two Boores-Heds to run by the &s;ea till it meets with the line between the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and you, and &s;o to run from the &s;ea by &s;aid Ma&s;&s;athu&s;etts line into the woods eight miles and from thence atwart the woods to meete with Port&s;mouth line neere Wheleright's creeke and that tracte of land to be called <HI>Hampton.</HI> So that their is foure towns named as you de&s;ired but Exeter is not within the bounds of your pattents. But the grete dificulty is the agreement about the dividing line between the pattent of the twenty thou&s;and acres belonging to the com|pany of Laconyah and the pattent of Bluddy poynt the river running &s;o intrycate, and Bluddy poynt pattent bounds from thence to Squam&s;cutt falls to run three miles into the woods from the water &s;ide.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR wor&s;hip have done well in &s;etting forward your plantacon, and for your milles they will prove benefici|al unto you, by God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I would you had taken this coor&s;e &s;ooner, for the marchants I &s;hall be very cant you &s;e how I deale with any of them while I live. But God's will be done. I and the world doth judge that I could not in the&s;e my dayes have &s;pent my time for noethinge. For their &s;ending trade and &s;upport I de&s;ire it not. I have &s;upported but now &s;onke under my burthen, the more I thinke on this, the more is my griefe.</P>
<P>I have received the hog&s;d. of mault that you &s;ent me, give|ing you humble thanks for the &s;ame. The &s;ervants that were with me are di&s;charged and payd their wages for the yeare pa&s;t and I have delivered unto Mr. Wannerton 43lb. of beaver to pay tho&s;e that were with him for the year pa&s;t. For the pay|ing of the &s;ervants there old wages or the dividing of the goods I expect a general letter, if not, then to heare further from your wor&s;hippe. Your carpenters are with me and I will further them the be&s;t I can. Capt. Neale appoynted me two of your goats to keepe, at his departinge, I prai&s;e God they are 4. Of the goods that Mr. Bright left I onely reed. of Capt. Neale 4 bu&s;hells of mault and at &s;everal times 8 gallons of &s;acke, and from Mr. Wannerton 7 bu&s;hells and 1 peck of mault, 5 lb. and &frac12; of &s;ugar and 3 pr. of children &s;tockings and 97 lb of beefe which was of an old cow that Mr. Wannerton killed, being doubtfull that &s;he would not live over the winter. For the&s;e I will pay Mr. Jocelin for you.</P>
<P><HI>I percieve you have a great mynd to the lakes, and I as great a will to a&s;&s;i&s;t you. If I had</HI> 2 <HI>hor&s;es and</HI> 3 <HI>men with me I would by God's helpe &s;oon re&s;olve you of the &s;ituation of it, but not to live there my&s;elfe.</HI></P>
<P>The Pide-Cow arrived the 8th of Julie, the 13th day &s;he ca&s;t anchor &s;ome halfe a mile from the falls, the 18th day the &s;hippe unladen, the 10th fell downe the river, the 22d day the carpen|ters began about the mill, the 5th of Augu&s;t the <HI>iron &s;toane</HI> taken in the &s;hippe. There is of 3 &s;orts, on &s;ort that the myne doth ca&s;t fourth as the tree doth gum, which is &s;ent in a rundit. On of the other &s;ortes we take to be very rich, there is great &s;tore of it. For the other I know not; but may it plea&s;e you to take notice of the waight and mea&s;ure of every &s;ort, be|fore it goeth into the furnace and what the &s;tone of &s;uch weight
<PB N="xiv" REF="018344_0383_0FA5D2E9AB1D27B8">
and mea&s;ure will yeeld in iron. This that 'e take to be the be&s;t &s;tone is one mile to the &s;outhward of the great hou&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great hou&s;e &s;tood oppo&s;ite to the hou&s;e of Mr. Temple Knight.</NOTE>, it is &s;ome 200 rodd in length 6 foote wide, the depth we know not, for want of tools for that purpo&s;e we tooke onely the &s;urface of the mine.</P>
<P>I have paled in a piece of ground and planted it. If it plea&s;e God to &s;end us a drie time I hope there will be 8 or 10 quarters of corne. You have heare at the great hou&s;e 9 cowes, 1 bull, 4 calves of the la&s;t yeare and 9 of this yeare; they prove very well, farre better than ever was expected, they are as good as your ordinary cattel in England, and the goats prove &s;ome of them very well both for milk and breed. If you did &s;end a &s;hippe for the We&s;tern I&s;lands of &s;ix &s;core tunne or thereabouts for cowes and goates it would be profitable for you. A &s;tocke of iron worke to be put away with your boardes from the mill will be good, nayles, &s;pikes, lockes, hinges, iron works for boats and pinaces, twine canvis, needles and cordage, pitch and tarre, graples, ankers, and nece&s;&s;arys for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Sr, I have written unto Mr. John Round to repair unto your wor&s;hip; he is a &s;ilver &s;mith by his trade but hath &s;pent much time and means about iron, may it plea&s;e you to &s;end for him, he dwelleth in Mogul &s;treet, if you are acquainted with any finer or mettle man enquire of him and as you &s;ee cau&s;e &s;end for him, he is well &s;eene in all mineralls; if you deale with him he will give you a good light for your proceedings.</P>
<P>The 6th of Augu&s;t, the &s;hippe ready to &s;et &s;ayle for Saco to load cloave bords and pipe &s;taves. A good hu&s;band with his wife to tend the cattle and to make butter and chee&s;e will be profitable, for maides they are &s;oone gone in this country.

hee was commi&s;&s;ionated as an agent of the corporacon of Bo&s;ton in New-England, but that now he had noe authority to appeare or act on their behalf.</P>
<P>Upon producing of divers letters pattents and examinacon of witne&s;&s;es, wee finde, that Capt. Jno. Ma&s;on, grandfather to Robert Ma&s;on one of the peticoners, and Edward Godfrey another of the peticoners, by virtue of &s;everal letters pattents under the great &s;eale of England granted unto them and others by your maje&s;ties late royal father, by them&s;elves and their a&s;&s;ignes have been in actual and quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal tracts, par&s;ells and divi&s;ions of land in New-England, as in and by the &s;aid letters patents is particularly expre&s;&s;ed, and that the &s;aid Capt. Jno. Ma&s;on and the &s;aid Edward Godfrey did expend and lay out con&s;iderable &s;ums of money in &s;ettling plantacons and collonys there; That the &s;aid Edward Godfrey has lived there for five and twenty yeares, having undergone and di&s;|charged the office of governor of the province of Mayne with much reputacon of integrity and ju&s;tice, endeavouring the re|gulacon and government of tho&s;e partes where he lives accord|ing to the known and &s;ettled lawes of this kingdome; That notwith&s;tanding, the &s;aid Edward Godfrey has not only been turned out of his &s;aid place of governor, butt has been utter|ly outed and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his lands and e&s;tate in that country, which the inhabitants of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts have forcibly &s;eized and &s;till doe detayne the &s;ame from him; That it appears as well by te&s;timony of witne&s;&s;es as by a coppy of the letters pat|tents that they were not to act any thing repugnant to the lawes of England, nor to extend their bounds and limits of the &s;aid corporacon farther than three miles northward of Merrymacke river, and as a memorial and evidence thereof, the governor of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts did &s;ett up an hou&s;e about thirty yeares &s;ince, which is called <HI>the bound hou&s;e,</HI> and is knowne by that name to this day, and with this divi&s;ion and a&s;&s;ignment or lort of land the inhabitants and pattentees of the &s;aid corporacon of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts re&s;ted content for the &s;pace of &s;ixteen years together, until about the year 1652 they did enlarge and &s;tretch their line about three&s;core miles be|yond their known and &s;ettled bounds afore&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d; and have thereby not only invaded and incroached upon the plantacons and inheritances of the petitioners and other your maje&s;ties &s;ubjects, but by menaces and armed forces compelled them to &s;ubmitt to their u&s;urped and arbitrary government which they have declared to be independent of this your maje&s;ties crowne of England, and not &s;ubordinate thereunto.</P>

<P>But the &s;aid councell of New-England made it plainley to appear to his maje&s;ty that they were ignorant of the whole matter and that they had noe &s;hare in the evills committed and wholly di&s;claimed the &s;ame, and the &s;aid councell finding they had not &s;ufficient means to give redre&s;s and rectify what was bro't to ruine, they humbly referred to his maje&s;ty to doe therein as he plea&s;ed and thereupon the &s;aid councell of New-England re&s;olved to re&s;ign, and did actually re&s;igne the great charter of New-England into his maje&s;ty's royal handes, &s;eeing there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for his maje&s;ty to take the management of that country to him&s;elf, it being become a bu|&s;ine&s;s of high con&s;equence and only to be remedied by his &s;o|vereign power, all which appears by the declaration of the councell of New-England dated the 25th of April, 1635, to|gether with the act of &s;urrender of the great charter of New-England dated the 7th day of June, the &s;ame year</P>

<HEAD>XIV. A brief declaration of the right and claim of the governour and company of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay in New-England, to the lands now in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but pretended to by Mr. Gorge and Mr. Ma&s;on, together with an an&s;wer to their &s;everal pleas and complaints in their petitions exhibited: Humbly pre&s;ented and &s;ubmitted by the &s;aid governour and compa|ny to the king's mo&s;t excellent maje&s;ty, as their defence.</HEAD>
<P>IN the yeare of our Lord 1628, in the third yeare of his late maje&s;ty Charles the fir&s;t, of happy memory, &s;everal loyal and piou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed gentlemen obtained of the great council of New-England, a grant of a certain tract of land lying in New-England, de&s;cribed and bounded as therein expre&s;&s;ed; which was in all re&s;pects fairly and openly procured and with &s;o good an intent of propagating the go&s;pel among the natives, and to advance the honour and dignity of his late maje&s;ty, of happy memory, that they were bold to &s;upplicate his &s;aid ma|je&s;ty to &s;uperadd his royal confirmation thereto, which ac|cordingly in an ample royal charter was pa&s;&s;ed and remains under the broad &s;eal of England, March the 4th 1629, in the fourth year of his maje&s;ties reign, with further additions and enlargements well becoming &s;o royal a maje&s;ty, and &s;uitable for the encouragement of &s;o hazardous and chargeable an ad|venture. In pur&s;uance whereof many of the &s;aid patentees and other adventurers tran&s;ported them&s;elves and e&s;tates and &s;ettled
<PB N="xxiii" REF="018344_0392_0FA5D2F5ADDEB4D0">
in the mo&s;t known and accommodable parts of tho&s;e lands con|tained in the &s;aid charter, neither time, e&s;tate, nor power &s;uf|fering them &s;peedily to &s;urvey the ju&s;t extent of their limits. Not many years different in time &s;everal others al&s;o of his ma|je&s;ty's &s;ubjects obtained other grants, and made &s;everal &s;ettle|ments in the more northern and ea&s;terne parts of the country, with whom for &s;everal years we had neighbourly corre&s;pond|ence, being as they &s;uppo&s;ed without the limits of our patent, among&s;t whom the pre&s;ent claimers and petitioners were. The&s;e grants partly by rea&s;on of the &s;mallne&s;s of &s;ome of them, and partly by rea&s;on of darke involv'd and dubious expre&s;&s;ion of their limits, brought the inhabitants under many inta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|ments and di&s;&s;atisfactions among them&s;elves, which there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no &s;ettled authority to be applied to, being de&s;erted and for|&s;aken of all &s;uch as by virtue of &s;aid grants did claim juri&s;dic|tion over them and had made a &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s e&s;&s;ay for the &s;ettle|ment of government among them proved of &s;ome continuance, unto the great di&s;quiet and di&s;turbance of tho&s;e his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects that were peaceable and well di&s;po&s;ed among&s;t them; to remedy which inconvenience they betook them&s;elves to the way of combinations for government, but by experience found it ineffectual. In this time ignorance of the northerly running of Merrimack river hindred our actual claim and extention of government, yet at length being more fully &s;ettled, and hav|ing obtained further acquaintance and corre&s;pondency with the Indians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the uppermo&s;t parts of that rivre en|couraging an adventure, as al&s;o frequent &s;ollicitations from the mo&s;t con&s;iderable inhabitants of tho&s;e ea&s;tern parts earne&s;tly de&s;iring us to make proofe of and a&s;certain our intere&s;t, we imployed the mo&s;t approved arti&s;ts that could be obtained, who upon their &s;olemn oaths made returns, That upon their certain ob&s;ervation our northern patent line did extend &s;o far north as to take in all tho&s;e towns and places which we now po&s;&s;e&s;s; which when the inhabitants as well as our &s;elves were &s;atisfied in (urged al&s;o with the nece&s;&s;ity of government a|mong&s;t them) they peaceably and voluntarily &s;ubmitted to the government of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, (viz.) Dover, Squam&s;cot and Port&s;mouth anno 1641, Kittery, York and Wells anno 1652 and 1653, from which times until the year 1662, when there was a &s;mall interruption by a letter of Mr. Gorge, and after|wards in the year 1665, (when his maje&s;tyes commi&s;&s;ioners, Colonel Nichols and others came over) the inhabitants of tho&s;e parts lived well &s;atisfied and uninterrupted under the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets government. But then the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners neither
<PB N="xxiv" REF="018344_0393_0FA5D2F6A8FA8250">
regarding the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets ju&s;t right nor the claims of Mr. Gorge and Mr. Ma&s;on, &s;ettled a new forme of government there, but this hardly outlived their departure, the people im|patient of innovations, and well experienced and &s;atisfied in their former &s;ettlement, quickly and quietly returned to order again and &s;o continue unto this time. This is in a few words the true &s;tate of the matter; for the further illu&s;tration where|of and ju&s;tification of our proceedings therein and vindication of our &s;elves from the reproachful imputation of u&s;urping au|thority over his maje&s;ties &s;ubjects in the ea&s;terne parts pretend|ed to, with other &s;candals ca&s;t upon us by the petitioners, we humbly pre&s;ent the following pleas by way of demon&s;tration, and argue that our exten&s;ion of government to tho&s;e ea&s;tern parts claimed is agreeable to our indubitable patent right; our patent according to the expre&s;s terme therein contained with|out any ambiguity or colour of other interpretation, lyes <HI>be|tween two ea&s;t and we&s;t paralel lines drawn from the mo&s;t &s;outh|erly part of Charles river and the mo&s;t northerly part of Merri|mack, with three miles advantage upon each,</HI> which upon the ob&s;ervation of men of approved and undoubted truth upon oath, are found di&s;tant one degree and forty nine minutes north la|titude, being to extend in full latitude and breadth from &s;ea to &s;ea (ut in terminis) and therefore cannot be bounded by many hundreds or infinite numbers of lines, as the river of Merri|mack maketh bends or angles in two hundred miles pa&s;&s;age from Winipe&s;ioke lake to the mouth thereof, which to ima|gine, as it is irrational &s;o would it involve us and any borderer into &s;o many inextricable di&s;putes as are by no wayes to be admitted by a prince &s;eeking his &s;ubjects peace. Be&s;ides were &s;uch a con&s;truction allowable (which with uttermo&s;t &s;treining is) yet all favourable interpretation is to be offered the paten|tees by the gracious expre&s;&s;ion of the charter. Now accord|ing to the afore mentioned ob&s;ervation (&s;o confirmed) all tho&s;e ea&s;tern plantations challenged by our opponents (ut &s;upra) are comprehended within our northerly line. We deny not but the arti&s;ts of their &s;elves, and if any que&s;tion thence ari&s;e we feare not to &s;ubmit to tryal to the mo&s;t exact and rigorous te&s;t that may be. The invincible &s;trength of this our fir&s;t plea may further appear by the con&s;ideration of the frivolous and in&s;ig|nificant allegations of the petitioners in oppo&s;ition thereunto, viz. 1&s;t. The nonextention of our line or a&s;&s;ertion of our right to tho&s;e ea&s;tern parts for &s;ome years, ignorance as our ca&s;e was circum&s;tanced debarring no man of his ju&s;t right, neither can it rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed that the exact &s;urvey of &s;o large a

<P N="2">2dly. The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion-hou&s;e in Hampton, of &s;o little &s;ignifi|cation and &s;o long &s;ince di&s;u&s;ed, that Mr. Ma&s;on hath forgot the name thereof and calleth it Bound-hou&s;e, erected to give the world to know that we claimed con&s;iderably to the north|ward of our then habitations upon the bay, though we did not know the uttermo&s;t extent of our right, our fathers not being &s;o ignorant of the law of the realme to which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y did apper|tain as to &s;uppo&s;e the taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of part did debar them of the remainder but the contrary; and we challenge Mr. Ma|&s;on or any on his behalfe, promi&s;ing our records &s;hall be open to the mo&s;t &s;crutinous &s;earch to prove it, either called or intend|ed according to his abu&s;e thereof.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. That notorious fal&s;hood of &s;tretching our right to near four hundred miles north and &s;outh more then formerly we were &s;atisfied with, our whole breadth being but one hun|dred and nine mile, which is not much more then a quarter part of what he would have the world believe our new claime and (as he would in&s;inuate) u&s;urped territory doth contain, ari&s;ing (we would charitably believe) partly from ignorance of the coa&s;ting of the country, Mr. Ma&s;on accounting by the &s;ea-&s;ide, and we &s;uppo&s;e coa&s;ting in the mea&s;ure of every har|bour and cove to make up that calculation, which lies much of it due ea&s;t and not to the north, but we fear malevolently &s;ugge&s;ted (as many other things as of little credit) to intro|duce into his maje&s;tie his royal brea&s;t a beliefe that we are un|rea&s;onable in our pretentions, and &s;o unworthy of his maje&s;ties favour, which we hope &s;uch unlawful endeavours will never be &s;o pro&s;perous as to obtain. What may be further added to this our fir&s;t plea, may be &s;upplied from the rea&s;ons formerly pre&s;ented. We urge &s;econdly, The invalidity of tho&s;e grants pretended to by the petitioners, which are of two &s;orts; 1&s;t. Such as beare date after ours, which we &s;ee no rea&s;on to feare any interruption from. Secondly, Such as are pretended to bear date before ours, again&s;t which we object that they are
<PB N="xxvi" REF="018344_0395_0FA5D2F8AD1B2650">
not authentick, wanting a &s;ufficient number of grantors to make them &s;o, none of them as we pre&s;ume will appeare upon tryal having above &s;ix hands and &s;eals annexed to them, the &s;aid council of New-England con&s;i&s;ting of forty, and his ma|je&s;tys grant to them expre&s;sly requiring (as we are informed) &s;even at the lea&s;t to &s;igne to make any valid act; and indeed Mr. Ma&s;on's own often unwearied renewal of his grants in 1621, &s;ixteen hundred twenty two, &s;ixteen hundred twenty nine and 1635, (as he &s;aith) tacitly confe&s;&s;eth the &s;ame invalidity, in the former puting him to charge for the latter, till at la&s;t he fell into &s;uch a trade of obtaining grants that his la&s;t and mo&s;t con|&s;iderable was &s;ix years after the grant of our charter from his maje&s;ty, and but three dayes before the &s;aid council's declara|tion of their ab&s;olute re&s;olution to re&s;ign, and but a few days before their actual &s;urrender, as he a&s;&s;erts; which of what va|lue and con&s;ideration it is from the &s;aid council's circum&s;tanced under a nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;ignation of their great charter, procur|ed rather by the clamour of &s;uch ill affected per&s;ons as the pre|&s;ent complaint than by any true accompt of di&s;&s;ettlement or ill management here, is not difficult to judge. Hence it appears, fir&s;t, how little rea&s;on Mr. Ma&s;on hath to brand us with fraud or &s;urreptitiou&s;ne&s;s in obtaining our charter; which hath mo&s;t &s;hew of fraud and &s;urreptitious procuration, a &s;ufficient num|ber of tho&s;e honble per&s;ons &s;ub&s;cribing ours and fewer his pre|tended antidated grants, is ea&s;ie to determine. In which a&s;|&s;ertion is to be ob&s;erved the high reflection ca&s;t upon the mem|bers of his late maje&s;ty and mini&s;ters of &s;tate, groundle&s;sly rendring the council's &s;eal, yea the great &s;eal of England, ex|po&s;ed to fraud and deceitful clande&s;tine practices; yea upon his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, in&s;inuating him&s;elfe better acquainted with matters of &s;tate then he who allows and confirmes our grant as authentick by his gracious letter of &s;ixteen hundred &s;ixty two, which intolerable boldne&s;s how unbecoming (not to &s;ay more) in a &s;ubject, it is not ea&s;ie for us to &s;ay. To all which we may add Sr Ferdinando Gorges application to the authority here to interpo&s;e in his affair, which he, being one of the great council, would have been far from acknowledging, had Mr. Ma&s;on's allegations been founded upon truth.</P>
<P>Secondly, That articles of charge depending upon &s;uch il|legal and po&s;t dated grants cannot take place again&s;t us were their di&s;bur&s;e as great as it is affirmed, which by eye witne&s;&s;es upon the place and &s;til living, are proved comparitively very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. We affirme that the whole management of the affair
<PB N="xxvii" REF="018344_0396_0FA5D2F96925F750">
re&s;pecting our government of tho&s;e ea&s;tern parts was in an or|derly and peaceable way, and not without the reiterated and earne&s;t &s;ollicitation of mo&s;t of the people there inhabiting, &s;uf|ficiently appearing by their &s;everal petitions; and we chal|lenge Mr. Gorge and Mr. Ma&s;on by any living evidence or re|cord to &s;hew any &s;igne of a forceable entrance: Some maji&s;trates upon the clearing of our right to them and acceptance of the tender of them&s;elves to us, being &s;ent thither without any o|ther force than each of them a &s;ervant to attend them. Indeed &s;ome years after Capt. Boniton for mutinous carriage was &s;eiz|ed and brought to ju&s;tice; concerning which and many other ca&s;es many inhabitants yet living and eye wittne&s;&s;es can give the mo&s;t impartial evidences.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. We offer to con&s;ideration that the de&s;erted and un|govern'd &s;tate of the people of tho&s;e places had we not had that patent right &s;o clearly evinced, might warrant our actions; e&s;pecially con&s;idering the obligation upon us to &s;ecure his ma|je&s;ty's honour and maintain the publick peace, &s;o hazarded by the total want of government among&s;t them. Our fir&s;t exer|ci&s;e of juri&s;diction being in the year 1641, eight year after Capt. Neale, agent for Mr. Ma&s;on, had wholy de&s;erted the improvement of land and the government of the country, which indeed he never u&s;ed but one year, for in the year 1630 he fir&s;t came over, and in the year 1634 he quitted the place; and in the interim neglected the &s;ame in making a voyage for Eng|land, the &s;hort time of his tarriance not admitting of &s;ettle|ment of government or improvement. We may hereto &s;ubjoin that Mr. Jo&s;eph Ma&s;on, agent for Mrs. Ann Ma&s;on, when here and all things were fre&s;h in memory, made no demand contrary to what is affirmed, but petitioned our ju&s;tice again&s;t his debtors there and el&s;ewhere, and that Sr Ferdinando Gorges his grant being &s;o mean and uncertainly bounded that he knew not well how to find much le&s;s to improve to con&s;i|derable advantage, by his letter bearing date&mdash;doth devolve the whole charge and care of his pretended province upon the authority here e&s;tabli&s;hed. La&s;tly, That the exer|ci&s;e of juri&s;diction in tho&s;e ea&s;tern parts hath been and is his maje&s;ty's honour, the people's great benefit, and our charge without profit, which had it not been, the ruine of tho&s;e parts would have unavoidably en&s;ued in the want of all government, and their &s;eizure by the French, who ever waited a fit oppor|tunity for the &s;ame.

<P>WHEREAS the right honourable the lords of the com|mittee for trade and plantations, did in pur&s;uance of an order of the 7th of February la&s;t make report to the board, of the matters in controver&s;y between the corporation of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay in New-England, and Mr. Ma&s;on and Mr. Gorges touching the right of &s;oil and government, claimed by the &s;aid parties in certain lands there, by virtue of &s;everal grants from his maje&s;ty's royal father and grandfather as fol|loweth, in the&s;e words.</P>
<P><PB N="xxix" REF="018344_0398_0FA5D2FADC2926F8">
May it plea&s;e your maje&s;ty,</P>
<P>Having received your maje&s;ty's order in council of the 7th of February la&s;t pa&s;t, whereby we are directed to enter into the examination of the bounds and limits which the corpora|tion of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay in N. E. on the one hand, and Mr. Ma&s;on and Mr. Gorges on the other, do pretend by their &s;everal grants and patents to have been a&s;&s;igned unto them, as al&s;o to examine the patents and charters which are in&s;i&s;ted on by either &s;ide, in order to find out and &s;ettle how far the rights of &s;oil and government do belong unto any of them. In con|&s;ideration whereof the lords chief ju&s;tices of your maje&s;ty's courts of king's bench and common pleas were appointed to give us their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we did on the 5th of April la&s;t toge|ther with the &s;aid lords chief ju&s;tices meet in obedience to your maje&s;ty's commands, and having heard both parties by their council learned in the law, we did recommend unto their lord|&s;hips to receive a &s;tate of the claims made by both parties, and to return their opinions upon the whole matter unto us, which their lord&s;hips have accordingly performed in the words fol|lowing:</P>
<P>In obedience to your lord&s;hips order we appointed a day for the hearing of all parties, and con&s;idering the matters referred, having received from them &s;uch papers of their ca&s;es as they were plea&s;ed to deliver; at which time all parties appearing, the re&s;pondents did di&s;claim title to the lands claimed by the petitioners, and it appeared to us that the &s;aid lands are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal other per&s;ons not before us, whereupon we thought not fit to examine any claims to the &s;aid lands, it be|ing (in our opinion) improper to judge of any title of land without hearing of the ter-tenants or &s;ome other per&s;ons on their behalf; and if there be any cour&s;e of ju&s;tice upon the place having juri&s;diction, we e&s;teem it mo&s;t proper to direct the parties to have recour&s;e thither for the deci&s;ion of any que&s;tion of property until it &s;hall appear that there is ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t the courts of ju&s;tice there for inju&s;tice or grievance.</P>
<P>We did in the pre&s;ence of &s;aid parties examine their &s;everal claims to the government, and the petitioners having waved the pretence of a grant of government from the council of Plymouth, wherein they were convinced by their own council that no &s;uch power or juri&s;diction could be transferred or a&s;|&s;igned by any colour of law; the que&s;tion was reduced to the province of Maine, whereto the petitioner Gorges made his title by a grant from king Charles the fir&s;t, in the 15th year
<PB N="xxx" REF="018344_0399_0FA5D181C1440538">
of his reign, made to Sir Ferd. Gorges and his heirs of the province of Maine and the government thereof. In an&s;wer to this the re&s;pondents alledged that long before, viz. in quarto Carol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mi, the government was granted to them, and pro|duced copies of letters patents wherein it is recited that the council of Plymouth having granted to certain per&s;ons a ter|ritory thus de&s;cribed, viz.
<Q>all that part of New-England in America which lies and extends between a great river that is commonly called Monomack alias Merrimack, and a cer|tain other river there called Charles river, being in the bot|tom of a certain bay there called the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, and al&s;o all and &s;ingular the lands and hereditaments what&s;oever lying and being within the &s;pace of three Engli&s;h miles on the &s;outh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;aid Charles river, or any or every part thereof; and al&s;o all and &s;ingular the lands and hereditaments what&s;oever lying and being within the &s;pace of three Eng|li&s;h miles to the &s;outhermo&s;t part of the &s;aid bay called Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay; and all tho&s;e lands and hereditaments what&s;oever which [<HI>lie</HI>] within the &s;pace of three Engli&s;h miles to the northward of the &s;aid river called Monomack alias Merrimack or the northward of any and every part thereof; and all lands and hereditaments what&s;oever lying within the limits afore&s;aid, north and &s;outh in latitude and breadth, and in length and longitude of and within all the breadth afore&s;aid throughout the main lands there, from the Atlantic and We&s;tern &s;ea and ocean on the ea&s;t part to the South &s;ea on the we&s;t.</Q>
By the &s;aid letters patents the king confirmed that grant, made them a corporation, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them power to make laws for the governing of the lands and the people therein. To which it was replied that the patent of 4^o Caroli primi is invalid, (1) Becau&s;e there was a precedent grant, 18^o Jacobi, of the &s;ame thing then in being, which patent was &s;urrendered afterwards and before the date of the other, 15^o Car. primi. (2) The grant of the government can extend no farther than the owner&s;hip of the &s;oil, the bound|aries of which as recited in that patent wholly excludes the province of Maine, which lies northward more than three miles beyond the river Merrimack.</P>
<P>We having con&s;idered the&s;e matters do humbly conceive as to the fir&s;t matter, that the patent of 4^o Caroli 1^m^i is good notwith&s;tanding the grant made in the 18^o Jac: for it appear|ed to us by the recital in the patent 4^o Caroli 1^m^i that the council of Plymouth had granted away all their intere&s;t in the lands the year before, and it mu&s;t be pre&s;umed they then de|&s;erted
<PB N="xxxi" REF="018344_0400_0FA5D183ED1BA738">
the government; whereupon it was lawful and nece&s;&s;ary for the king to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;uitable frame of government, ac|cording to his royal wi&s;dom, which was done by that patent, 4^o Caroli 1^m^i making the adventurers a corporation upon the place. As to the &s;econd matter it &s;eems to us to be very clear that the grant of the government 4^o Caroli 1^m^i extends no farther than the boundaries expre&s;&s;ed in the patent, and tho&s;e boundaries cannot be con&s;trued to extend further north|wards along the river Merrimack than three Engli&s;h miles, for the north and &s;outh bounds of the lands granted &s;o far as the river extends are to follow the cour&s;e of the rivers which make the breadth of the grant, the words de&s;cribing the length to comprehend all the lands from the Atlantic ocean to the South &s;ea of and in all the breadth afore&s;aid, do not warrant the over reaching tho&s;e bounds by imaginary lines or bounds, other expo&s;ition would (in our humble opinion) be unrea&s;onable and again&s;t the intere&s;t of the grant. The words "of and in all the breadth afore&s;aid" &s;hew that the breadth was not intended an imaginary line of breadth, laid upon the broade&s;t part but the breadth re&s;pecting the continuance of the boundaries by the river as far as the rivers go, but when the known boun|dary of breadth determines it mu&s;t be carried on by imaginary lines to the South &s;ea. And if the province of Maine lies more northerly than three Engli&s;h miles from the river Merrimack, the patent of 4^o Caroli 1^m^i gives no right to govern there, and thereupon the patent of the &s;ame 15^o Car. 1^m^i to the petitioner Gorges will be valid. So that upon the whole matter we are hum|bly of opinion as to the power of government, that the re&s;pond|ents, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, by their patent of 4^o martis 4^o Caroli 1^m^i have &s;uch right of government as is granted them by the &s;ame patent within the boundaries of their lands expre&s;&s;ed therein, according to &s;uch de&s;cription and expo&s;iti|on as we have thereof made as afore&s;aid, and the petitioner Sir Ferdinando Gorges his heirs and a&s;&s;igns by the patent 3d April, have &s;uch right of government as is granted them by the &s;ame patent within [<HI>the territory</HI>] called the province of Maine according to the boundaries of the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame patent.</P>

<HEAD>No. XX. An&s;wer to the claim made by Mr. Ma&s;on to the hou&s;es and lands of New-Hamp&s;hire. [In Mr. Weare's hand writing, but without date or &s;ignature.]</HEAD>
<P>IT does not legally appear that Mr. Ma&s;on can lay any ju&s;t claime to any of the lands in New-Hamp&s;hire, for what right he pretends is either derived from Capt. Jno. Ma&s;on, (whom he &s;ays was his grandfather) or from his maje&s;ty's com|mi&s;&s;ion: But pre&s;ume from neither of the&s;e has he any right. Not from Capt. Jno. Ma&s;on; for, (1) It does not legally ap|pear that ever he had any right to the province of New-Hamp|&s;hire. It is true there is a copy of a pattent or deed from the councell of Plymouth, which he brings over without atte&s;tati|on of publique notary or any other authority. Be&s;ides in &s;aid coppy there is not the lea&s;t intimation of any hand or &s;eale to the originall, and there is two men that &s;wears this is a true coppy of the originall, which plainly demon&s;trates that the originall is but a blanck; the truth whereof we are the more confirmed in, becau&s;e it is not rational to imagine that Mr. Ma&s;on would come from England to pro&s;ecute a right and not bring with him what he had to make good his claime; but having nothing but blanck coppies, he could bring no better than he had, which cannot be looked upon as authen|tique in any court.</P>
<P N="2">(2) If it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed that ever Capt. Jno. Ma&s;on had a right by pattent, yet it does not appear how Robert Tufton Ma&s;on (as the plantiffe calls him&s;elf) derives a title from him either as his heir, executor or admini&s;trator, or by deed of gift; all that we can hear in court is that the plantife calls him&s;elf Capt. Ma&s;on's heir.</P>
<P N="3">(3) If the plantiffe or his ance&s;tors ever had a title to the lands he claims by pattent from the councill of Plymouth, yet they have lo&s;t it by non u&s;e, for they never attended the ends of granting patents by king James, of ble&s;&s;ed memory, in his hyne&s;s pattent to the great councell of Plymouth, which was the peopling of the land, inlargeing the king's dominions,
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="018344_0407_0FA5D18C17E0D2D0">
propagating the go&s;pel, conver&s;ion of the heathen the native proprietors, &amp;c. Now the plantife nor ance&s;tors never planted this province nor expended any thing upon it to the uphold|ing of it in peace nor war, but the pre&s;ent inhabitants did ei|ther by them&s;elves or predece&s;&s;ors, purcha&s;e their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions from the natives, and by their permi&s;&s;ion did &s;it down upon the land and manured, to the va&s;t expence of above 50 years time in hard labor, and expending upon it their whole e&s;tate. And in the late Indian war did defend it again&s;t the enimy to the lo&s;s of many of their lives and con&s;iderable part of their e&s;tates, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Mr. Ma&s;on who now claimes not only what poor people have purcha&s;ed and laboured hard upon, but al&s;o conquered or relived from cruell attempts of the barbarous heathen, and we conceave we were under no ob|ligation to run &s;uch adventures to make our&s;elves &s;laves to Mr. Ma&s;on.</P>
<P N="4">(4) It does not appear that there was a quorum of the great councell of Plymouth to the making of Capt. Ma&s;on's deed ac|cording to the pattent granted to the great councell of Ply|mouth, which renders his claime unvalide, if ever any thing in that kind was done, which we que&s;tion.</P>
<P>From what is &s;aid we humbly conceave Mr. Ma&s;on has no right from Capt. Jno. Ma&s;on.</P>
<P>And that his maje&s;tie's commi&s;&s;ion does neither give nor con|firme any title to the lands claimed, we prove:</P>
<P N="1">(1) We humbly conceave that his royal maje&s;ty who is &s;o prudent a prince and &s;o &s;olicitus for the peace of his &s;ubjects, would not have left that matter doubtfull to his &s;ubjects of this province but rather have told us that he had given all the lands to Mr. Ma&s;on, but there is nothing of gift to him in the com|mi&s;&s;ion and <HI>if his maje&s;ty had</HI> (which we cannot believe he would) we &s;hould crave the benefit of the &s;tatute in the 17^o of Charles the fir&s;t, which &s;ays, No king and councell can alienate lands but by due cour&s;e of law. But wee were never yet heard, and when it comes to legal tryal wee pre&s;ume the law of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions will confirm our lands to us, &s;eeing we have had peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion 50 yeares.</P>
<P N="2">(2) If his maje&s;ty had given the lands in the province to Mr. Ma&s;on, what can be under&s;tood by that clau&s;e in the commi&s;|&s;ion
<Q>That in ca&s;e the inhabitants &s;hall refu&s;e to agree with Mr. Ma&s;on, then the governor &s;hall interpo&s;e and reconcile all dif|ferences if he can, but if he cannot then to &s;end the ca&s;e, fairely &s;tated to England that his maje&s;ty and privy councell might determine according to right;</Q>
which wee humbly conceave
<PB N="xxxix" REF="018344_0408_0FA5D18FEAC38A50">
puts a barr to any legal proceedings until his maje&s;ty's mind be further known therein. The inhabitants have offered their rea&s;ons to the governor according to commi&s;&s;ion, which he will not admit of, only did take of one, viz. Capt. Stileman, and promi&s;ed to &s;end them to England, but we can hear of no an&s;wer and much fear his neglect.</P>
<P N="3">(3) His maje&s;ty in his commi&s;&s;ion &s;ays,
<Q>To prevent un|rea&s;onable demands that may be made by Mr. Ma&s;on for the right he claimes,</Q>
which claime may prove good or bad when it comes to tryall. We under&s;tand to claime and to have are different things.</P>
<P N="4">(4) His maje&s;ty intimates in his royal commi&s;&s;ion by what title Mr. Ma&s;on does claime, viz. by a grant to his ance&s;tors,
<Q>who improved and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the province with great expence, until mole&s;ted and finally driven out;</Q>
but this province can|not be concluded to be the place he claims until he make the&s;e circum&s;tances appear, which we are &s;ure he never can doe.</P>
<P>Now Mr. Ma&s;on not producing any original deed for any of the lands of this province, nor authentique copies, the inha|bitants cannot make any compliance with him both becau&s;e we &s;ee no right he ever had, or believing if ever any was he hath mortgadged it already in England, and &s;o alienated what right he had.</P>
<P>Although upon the former grounds we have good plea again&s;t Mr. Ma&s;on's claime, yet we did not &s;ee cau&s;e to join i&s;&s;ue, not only becau&s;e judges and jurors were not qualified according to law, all of them being pickt for e&s;pou&s;ing Mr. Ma&s;on's inte|re&s;t by the governor's order, who has a mortgadge for 21 yeares from Mr. Ma&s;on for all the lands in the province. But al&s;o becau&s;e wee was willing to attend the methods pre&s;cribed by his maje&s;ty in his royal commi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Honor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to your comand that I &s;hould render a rea&s;on why I refu&s;e to pay quit-rent unto Robert Ma&s;on, e&s;q. (as he titles him&s;elf) for my hou&s;e and lands, and take deeds from him for the confirming of the &s;ame, I an&s;wer as followeth:</P>
<P N="1"><PB REF="018344_0409_0FA5D1914E7C86D0">1&s;tly. Becau&s;e my &s;aid land I bought and paid for. The title unto which is &s;ucce&s;&s;ively derived unto me from tho&s;e that have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, without any claime for at lea&s;t the&s;e 50 yeares, upon which I have built at my own charge without any in|terruption, and am in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof as my owne. As to what is &s;aid in the comi&s;&s;ion concerning Mr. Ma&s;on's pro|prieters, with all due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his maje&s;ty, I conceive it imploys rather his claime than a po&s;itive determination of his title.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. I humbly conceive that being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what I have bought and built upon, it re&s;ts upon the claimer to make out his title (if he have any by law), begging the favour of an Engli&s;h &s;ubject therein, that it may be fir&s;t tryed upon the place, according to the &s;tatute law and the opinion of his ma|je&s;ty's judges in England, and this before I am liable to pay quit-rent and take deeds of confirmation from him.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Should Mr. Ma&s;on obtaine his demands, my&s;elf and the re&s;t of the inhabitants would be undone forever, for then all his granted to him which hee calls commons being out of fence, which yet hath been bounded out by the &s;everal towns and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them for the&s;e 50 yeares, and improved for the maintainance of their cattle both winter and &s;ummer, and for timber and fire wood, without which there is no liveing for us, it being impo&s;&s;ible for us to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon that which in the commi&s;&s;ion is called gardens, orchards, if he may have the di&s;po&s;al of the re&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The &s;aid Ma&s;on &s;peaks of many thou&s;ands of pounds expended upon the place, which with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion cannot be made out, and if it could, what then have the poor planters ex|pended in &s;o many yeares labour &s;ince their fir&s;t &s;itting downe upon it, when they found it an howling wilderne&s;s and <HI>vacuum domicilium,</HI> be&s;ides a great expence of blood and e&s;tate to de|fend it in the late Indian warr, nor can they to this day make both ends meet by all their labour and frugality, and therefore mu&s;t needs &s;ink under the exaction of &s;uch a propriator.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The land which Mr. Ma&s;on claimes as propriator is the land on which &s;uch va&s;t expence hath been laid out by his grandfather Captain John Ma&s;on, for the peopling of it and the land from whence his &s;aid grandfathers &s;ervants were vio|lently driven out, or expeled by the inhabitants of the Ma&s;&s;athu|&s;ets, but upon this land there was no &s;uch expence laid out by his grandfather Captain John Ma&s;on for the end afore&s;aid, nor is this the land from whence any &s;ervants of his &s;aid grand|father were &s;o expelled, and therefore we that are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
<PB N="xli" REF="018344_0410_0FA5D192C97B17F0">
this land are not concerned in his claime, hee hath mi&s;taken his province and may endeavour to find it &s;ome other where, for here is no &s;uch place.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. If Mr. Ma&s;on had a patent here, why did he not take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the day thereof. If hee were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion why did he not keep it &s;till: None ever drove him out as he informs, had hee been once &s;ettled he might to this day have kept it as the re&s;t of the inhabitants have done without the lea&s;t molli&s;ta|tion, but I am humbly of opinion that if he the &s;aid Ma&s;on or any of his ayres came hither, they only came as many &s;hips did to Newfoundland and to this countrey to make a fi&s;hing voyadge or beaver trade, and that being at an end departed and left their room to the next taker.</P>
<P>This is the &s;umme of what I have at pre&s;ent to an&s;wer, hum|bly reque&s;ting of your honour the &s;tating of the ca&s;e, with your opinion thereupon to his maje&s;ty as the commi&s;&s;ion directs; and when his maje&s;ty &s;hall in his wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice &s;ee meet to order an hearing of the matter in his courts of judicature upon the place before a jury of unintere&s;ted and indifferent per&s;ons which may be had out of the neighbouring province, (and po&s;&s;ibly Mr. Ma&s;on may think not attainable in this pro|vince wherein all per&s;ons are concerned,) as he hath been plea&s;ed to doe by that part of Mr. Ma&s;on's claime, which lyes under his maje&s;ty's government of the Ma&s;&s;athu&s;ets, I hope to be able upon the&s;e and other grounds &s;o far to make out my title as to be held unblameable before God and man, for not comply|ing with his demands.

<P>BY &s;everal advices we have received of a &s;udden ri&s;ing in|tended by the Indians in the&s;e ea&s;tern parts to fall upon the Engli&s;h, we judged it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary without delay to provide for the &s;afety and pre&s;ervation of his maje&s;ty's &s;ub|jects inhabiting this province, and to give releef (if need be) to our neighbouring colonies. We have therefore upon con|&s;ideration of the be&s;t means for the &s;ecuring of the&s;e provinces concluded it very nece&s;&s;ary to entertain a number of &s;outhern Indians for &s;ouldiers, who are be&s;t acquainted with the man|ner of the&s;e Indians &s;kulking fight; and this being <HI>a work of piety and charity</HI> for preventing the effu&s;ion of chri&s;tian blood: And knowing that your honor has an influence upon the &s;ou|thern Indians our honourable governor was willing to take the trouble upon him&s;elf of a journey to New-York to treat with your honor for &s;ending of &s;uch a number of Mahiquas, or o|ther Indians, as may be convenient to a&s;&s;i&s;t in this &s;ervice, and to make &s;uch capitulations and agreement as to his honor &s;hall &s;eem rea&s;onable.

<P>THESE &s;erves to give covert to the inclo&s;ed which ware unhappily mi&s;laid, and &s;o brought to Port&s;mouth in&s;ted of beinge carried by you to London though on the other hand you carried many papers for London which oughte to have been at Port&s;mouth. There ware &s;everall papers in the bondle which ware very impertinente unto your bu&s;ine&s;s, and the tran&s;portinge of them very prejudicyall to &s;om here, your e&s;pe|cyall care aboute them is expected, yet may be &s;afely returned with you if not tran&s;mitted by you before your returne. Wee are now a doeinge aboute geti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge eviden&s;es &s;worne, which you &s;hall have a further account by the fir&s;te, tho' retarded much by havinge no copies of them as wee expected. Sin&s;e your de|parture much ado have been made, many execucyons extended, viz. upon Mrs Cutt, Daniele, my&s;elf, Mr. Fletcher, Moody, Hunkins, Earle, Pickeringes, Booth, &amp;c. I went to pri&s;on

but was redeemed with money, &s;everall dores ware broken open by Matthews the mar&s;hall's deputy, che&s;tes al&s;o and trunks and carried out of the hou&s;es till redeemed with money. John Partridge and Wm Cotten are in pri&s;on and have been &s;undry daies. No pay (as fi&s;h, &s;heep, hor&s;es, &amp;c.) would be taken for their executyons, &s;o there bodyes ware levied upon and there they lye. Our meni&s;ter for refu&s;inge to admene&s;ter the &s;acra|ment to the gouernor is bound over to the quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions to &s;it to morro, the i&s;shew wee know not but &s;ix months impri|&s;onment thretned.

<P N="5">5th. Quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions are come, and there Capt. Barefoote, Mr. Fryer, Coffin, Greene, Roby, Edgerly, were ju&s;tices, Raines was attorny. It was brought in as a plea of the crowne. Mr. Moody pleaded his not beinge ordained, havinge no main|tenan&s;e according to &s;tatute and therefore not obliged to that worke which the &s;tatute required. Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;tatutes were not made for the&s;e pla&s;es, the knowne end of there removal hither beinge that they might enjoye liberty in the&s;e forrin plantatyones which the&s;e could not have by vertew of the &s;ta|tutes at home, and ware allowed to have here, e&s;pecyally our comityon grantinge liberty of contyen&s;e. The&s;e things ware pleded, but to no purpo&s;e, after a &s;horte pleding and that not withoute many interoptyones and &s;miles by the pragmatticke, bu&s;ey impertenente atturny, he was comited to the mar&s;hall, (viz. Longe Matthews) and held in cu&s;tody that night tho' permitted to lodge at Capt. Stileman's. The ju&s;ti&s;es debated a littell, foure of them entered there de&s;ente, viz. Mr. Fryer, Greene, Roby, Edgerly, but Capt. Barefoote and Coffin ware for his condemnatyon. Judgment of the ca&s;e, every man's was entered by the &s;ecretary over night, but being deferred till nexte morninge informatyon was given to &s;omebody who came in and thretned and hectored after &s;uch a rate that Green and Roby al&s;o con&s;ented as you &s;ee by the inclo&s;ed, and hee was comited to pri&s;on. Petyon was by him made to the courte, and afterward to the governor, that hee might &s;tep up at nighte to his famely and &s;ettle matters there, and that he mighte not

ther attempt here, but with what conveniente expedytyon will be don what is needful and nece&s;&s;ary. Mr. Martin was &s;ued at the courte in two actyones, one by Mr. Ma&s;on for fines &amp; forfetures collected and received by him as trea&s;urer from &s;e|venty nine to eighty two, and another actyon by the governor for fines, &amp;c. from April eighty two. He is ca&s;te in both ac|tyones to the valew of about &s;eventy pounds, although hee pleded that what hee received was di&s;po&s;ed by order of the au|thority which made him trea&s;urer, and had as good comityon from his mage&s;tie as that was in beinge, neither did it legally appeare that ether Mr. Ma&s;&s;on or the governor have anny righte to fines and forfetures, the kinge appointinge all publicke mo|ny to be di&s;po&s;ed or improved for the &s;upporte of the govern|ment; however it is but a&s;ke and have, there demands in any ca&s;e have the force of an executyon.</P>
<P N="10">10th. The &s;abbath is come but no prechinge at the Banke, nor anny allowed to com to us; we had noone but the fameley with us, the pore people wantinge for lake of bred. Motyones have bin made that Mr. Moody may goe up and prech on the Lord's daye, tho' hee com downe to pri&s;&s;on at night, or that naibor mini&s;ters might be permitted to com and prech, or that the people might com downe to the pri&s;&s;on and here as many as could, but nothing will doe; an unparraleled example among&s;t chri&s;tians to have a mene&s;ter putt oute and no other way found to &s;upply his pla&s;e by one menes or other. Mr. Frier was &s;e|verely thretned for refu&s;einge to &s;ub&s;cribe Mr. Moody's comit|ment, but hath obtained fairely a di&s;mityon from all publike offices. Ju&s;tis Edgerly al&s;o cai&s;hered, and bound over to the quarter &s;e&s;&s;iones. It is &s;aid that ju&s;tis Greene is much afflicted for what hee has done, but Roby not. Peter Coffin can &s;car&s;e &s;how his hed in anny company<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Moody in the church records remarks thus on his judges:
<Q>Not long after Green repented and made his acknowledgment to the pa&s;tor who frankly forgave him. Robie was excommunicated out of Hamp|ton church for a common drunkard and died excommunicate, and was by his friends thrown into a hole near his hou&s;e for fear of an arre&s;t of his carca&s;e. Barefoote fell into a langui&s;hing di&s;temper whereof he died. Coffin was taken by the Indians, [at Cochecho 1689] his hou&s;e and mill burnt, him&s;elf not being &s;lain but di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; the Lord give him repentance, though no &s;igns of it have yet appeared.</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="14">14th. Nu&s;e came from the fourte at Ca&s;co that there was greate danger of the Indyanes ri&s;inge, which hath occatyoned a meetinge of the coun&s;eil and &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e, but here no more &s;in&s;e and hope it may vani&s;h.</P>

<P N="24">24th. This &s;abboth our wives, children and &s;ervants came downe and &s;pente the daye with us in our chamber, and wee yet here nothing &s;aid again&s;te it.</P>
<P N="25">25th. The mar&s;hall goes and levies upon John the Greeke's &s;heep and cattle for the executyon, for which hee had laine a|boute three weekes in pri&s;&s;on, and then came and ordered him to goe about his bu&s;ne&s;&s;e, 15 &s;heepe, &s;undry lambes, and two haifers &s;ezed for &s;ix pounds od mony. This day all&s;o Mr. Jaf|fery havinge had &s;undery warninges the weeke before to clere his hou&s;e beca&s;e Mr. Ma&s;&s;on would com and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, wente never the les to the Banke upon bu&s;nes; mene while came Mr. Ma&s;on with the mar&s;hall and turned all his &s;ervants out of dores, &s;et another locke on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore, and at night when his &s;ervants came home wett they would not &s;uffer them to com in, but there lodged Matthews and Thurton all nighte.

<P>One word more aboute my bu&s;nes. I am under impri&s;on|ment aboute Thurton's bu&s;ne&s;s, being &s;eized by the mar&s;hall and comited when in pri&s;&s;on before for not giveing bond for the good behavior, tho' nothinge charged upon me any more than before, which you well know. I know nothing but they intend to keep mee here endle&s;sly; it's &s;aide I mu&s;te paye one hundred pounds for &s;trikeinge one of the king's officers and mu&s;te have my name returned into the exchequer and mu&s;te lye in pri&s;&s;on till the mony be paid and I am di&s;charged from the exchequer. The de&s;igne you may e&s;ely &s;ee is to ruine mee, and how vaine my ples will be you maye e&s;ely gue&s;&s;e. Tho' I have manny thinges to &s;aie, viz. that Thurton was ether no officer or at le&s;te not knowne to be &s;o, however not &s;worne, nor did I &s;trike him in the hyewaye as hee &s;weares, nor is there anny proofe but his own &s;ingle te&s;timony, which how far it a|vailes in &s;uch a ca&s;e would be con&s;idered; it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s al&s;o worthy of inquire whether ever that law was intended for us, here beinge no cu&s;toms to be gathered, no exchequer to be applyed to, and therefore how the&s;e methods can be ob&s;erved is not intel|legable. You may e&s;ely imagen how things will be if I am for&s;ed to complye with there humors. Pray con&s;ult, con&s;ider, and &s;ee if &s;omethinge may not be done to putt a &s;top to &s;uch arbetrary pro&s;eedings, a triall on the pla&s;e by indifferente un|con&s;erned judges and jurors if at le&s;te there can anny &s;uch be found hoo will not be for&s;ed into what &s;ome will have done, but I &s;hall not need to in&s;truct you; there you have better coun&s;ell then I can give you, and of your fedelyty to inquire and remitte by the fir&s;te what is needful on this account I doute not.</P>
<P>I have given you but a ta&s;te, wee that &s;ee it know more then can po&s;&s;ibly bee under&s;tood by tho&s;e that only here; in a word&punc; <HI>&s;uch is the haith of there heat and raidge that there is no livinge for us longe in this condityon.</HI> Butt wee hope God will bee &s;eene in the mounte.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have in&s;erted what &s;ell oute after the de&s;olvinge of the rebellyous a&s;&s;embly, there was di&s;cour&s;e of con&s;tables, and in&s;ted of the freemen's chu&s;inge as formerly they tooke a &s;horte and cheper cour&s;e, and at the quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions con&s;tables were cho&s;en and to begin with Mr. Speker, he has the honner to be con&s;table for Port&s;mouth, Capt.

Foul&s;ham at Exeter. Whether Mr. Speker &s;hall &s;erve or fine is not yet determined. And now I am &s;pekinge of the general a&s;&s;embly, mu&s;te hinte what was formerly forgotten, vz. that they convened on the Mondaye and the choice of the &s;peker (there ould one) in words hily approved and hee complemented alamode. Then a bill was &s;ente them downe (of which if I can get it being now in pri&s;&s;on &s;hall inclo&s;e a copia) which they talked a littel of and then brake up for the nighte and went up to the Banke to lodge (the tide &s;erving very well to goe and com), the reporte of which hily di&s;gu&s;ted, and the next morn|ing the an&s;wer to the bill vehemently urged, which was in fine a negative. Hereopon in a grete raidge telling them they had bin up to con&s;ult with Moody an uter enemy to church and coman welth with much of like nature, hee di&s;&s;olved them, which was don on the Tue&s;day, after which he came up to the Banke and gave order for a &s;acrament on the next Lord's daye as you have herd and &s;in&s;e the a&s;&s;embly men pricked for con|&s;tables.</P>

<P N="28">28th. Sin&s;e Mr. Jaffery was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, Raines offered him for five &s;hillings per annum quit-rent to Mr. Ma&s;on, hee &s;hould have his hou&s;e againe, provided hee would owne him proprietor, but hee refu&s;inge it is &s;aid hee &s;hall never have it againe. The talke is that his hou&s;e mu&s;te be court-hou&s;e and pri&s;&s;on booth, and &s;tandinge &s;o nere the governor it is judged &s;utable for booth tho&s;e ends, that hee may have the &s;horter journey to courte and the pri&s;oners may bee alwaies under his eye.</P>
<P N="29">29th. John the Greeke havinge laine &s;om weekes in pri&s;&s;on upon executyon, his goods haveinge bin levied upon (as above), was by Raines locked oute of the pri&s;&s;on and bidden to be gon, but hee would not, keepes his quarters &s;till with the other two.

<P>March 5. It is &s;aid that they are goinge this daye to Ma|jor Waldrone's to &s;erve him as they have done Mr. Jafferey, and it's given out that the re&s;te will be treted in like manner; the courte was adjourned ye&s;terdaye to the nexte month pbably that they mighte levey the executyons that are in Banke be|fore they cutt oute anny more worke. Ju&s;tis Green &s;eems &s;omethinge troubled for &s;endinge the mene&s;ter to pri&s;&s;on, and &s;aith hee will never doe &s;uch a thinge againe, but Peter Coffin &s;aith it is a nine dayes worder and will &s;oone be forgotten, but others thinke otherwi&s;e.

<P>In my la&s;te I &s;ente you a letter to SIR JOSIAH CHILD my ma&s;ter, of which al&s;o you have another copia herewith. My de&s;igne is that you carry the letter your&s;elfe, waite on him while he reades it, and if he will ple&s;e to here you (as I hope hee maye) that you amplyfie matters, informe him what fur|ther intelligens you have and attende his directyon, if God move his hearte to doe oughte for us.

<P N="6">6th. Matthews and Thurton hunted for Mr. Jafferey, &s;erched in Mrs. Cutt's hou&s;e, wente into every room above and below &s;taires, &s;erched under her bed where &s;he lay &s;ike in it but found him not.

<P>The governor tould Mr. Jaffery's negro hee mighte goe from his ma&s;ter, hee would clere him under hand and &s;ele, &s;o the fello no more attends his ma&s;ter's con&s;ernes.</P>

<P>I am credible informed and you maye beleeve it, that the governor did in the open coun&s;ell ye&s;terdaye &s;aye and &s;ware dredfully, that hee would put the provinces into the grete&s;te confu&s;ion and di&s;tractyon hee could po&s;&s;ible and then goe away and leve them &s;oe, and then the devell take them all. Hee al&s;o then &s;aid that Mr. Ma&s;&s;on &s;aid hee would drive them into a &s;econd rebellyon, but him&s;elfe would doe it before; and I wonder he has not, &s;uch actings are the redy way, but God hath kepte us hether to and I hope he will doe &s;o &s;till. Hee al&s;o &s;aid and &s;wore that anny per&s;on that &s;hould have any man|ner of conver&s;e with us or any of our mind, he would counte them his utter enemies and carry toward them as &s;uch.</P>

<P>This daye Raines beinge not willinge to give up a warrante that he had executed duringe the &s;horte time of beinge &s;heriffe, was &s;ent for by the governor, and not apperinge, the gover|nor came to his chamber and did bete him dredfully, and bad the mar&s;hall carry the rouge to gaile.

Hooke's and got him to give warrants to the con&s;tables on the other &s;ide to &s;erch all hou&s;es for Mr. Jaffery and bring him over, but they found him not, nor is he yet found, tho proclamatyon was made at Wells courte for his &s;e&s;ure, tho' not yet done.</P>

<DATE>May 84.</DATE>
[<HI>Subjoined to the foregoing letter.</HI>]</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AT a &s;e&s;&s;iones held the 6th May, 1684, I was denied coun|&s;ell, and to have witne&s;&s;es &s;worne. Mr. Waldron, Captain Stileman and Captain Fro&s;te were pre&s;ented.</P>
<P N="10">10th. The governor was with me in pri&s;on. Mr. Cham|berlin, Mr. Hinkes and Mr. Sherloake with him.</P>
<P>The governor proffered mee (that whereas I was fined by the ju&s;tices in Thurton's ca&s;e, that I might thinke they had not done mee rite) that if I would pro&s;ecute it (giveing &s;ecurety &s;o to doe,) in the king's bench at We&s;tmin&s;ter, the exchequer, or before kinge and coun&s;ell, I &s;hould; though by his comi|tyon hee could not do it. My an&s;er was, unles I could have &s;ecurety given mee that in ca&s;e I &s;hould recover, I might have my charge and damidge made mee good, it would be of no benefit to mee. He &s;aid there was no re&s;on for that, beca&s;e it was for the kinge; though it was his beca&s;e Mr. Ma&s;on had
<PB N="lxiv" REF="018344_0432_0FA5D1A5AA9E1C48">
re&s;ind up to the kinge all fines and forfitures and the kinge had given it to him. But he &s;aid if I would depo&s;ite a valu|able &s;om hee would doe the like and would give bond, and have it tried as above&s;aid. My an&s;wer was I thoughte the forty pounds was eno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and that I expected executyon would com oute at the time, and &s;hould endevour by the time to provide enofe for it, but withal tould the governor it was at his liberty to remit it if he plea&s;ed by vertue of his comityon.</P>
<P>All &s;o for my beinge in pri&s;on for not giveing bond for my good behaviour, when the &s;e&s;&s;iones came I was not broughte to my triall for that, but remanded to pri&s;&s;on again.</P>
<P>At ditto time the governor tould mee hee had put me in pri&s;&s;on on that account, and hee would abide by it till I would give two hundred pound bound. My an&s;er was I had rather ly in pri&s;&s;on then give bond to tempt &s;uch a fello as Thurton, (or &s;uch others) that had &s;worne again&s;te me alredy, and fal&s;ly, and judged it might be no &s;cruple to him to doe the like again. And withal tould him that if his honner ple&s;ed to let mee oute of pri&s;on, I would ingaidge my&s;elfe by bond to live oute of the provines, though that would be very detrementall to my con|&s;erns and by that I hoped he would have no thoughts of my mi&s;behaveinge my&s;elfe, that would be detrementall to the kinges governmente here or him&s;elf. Not that I &s;crupled give|inge bond for my good behaviour, though not accu&s;ed for anny thinge but for layeinge a temptatyon to &s;om ba&s;e minded per&s;on or per&s;ons to for&s;ware them&s;elves, as one had done be|fore in another ca&s;e relateinge to me.</P>
<P>May 12th. Was informed that whereas Thurton had a comityon to be pri&s;&s;on keeper, (and withal had vapored and &s;aid the pri&s;&s;on was to good for Vaughan, and the roome that hee had &s;ited up did intend to kepe it him&s;elfe and that V. &s;hould take his quarters where he would a&s;&s;igne it, and that the pri&s;oners &s;hould not be waited on as Abbot had done, for he would keep them loaked up, only com morninge and even|inge) lo&s;te his poaket booke wherein was his comityon and &s;undry papors of con&s;ernment.</P>

<P>ACcordinge to your command and order to me, bearinge date the 2d in&s;tant, I have to the utmo&s;t of my power ob&s;erved every particular. Upon our arrival there on Friday night they were all very courteous to us, and in the morninge my orders were read which was very kindly received by them, and the rea&s;ons why they de&s;erted the places where they u&s;u|ally abode among the Engli&s;h was,</P>
<P N="1">1. That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our Indians came from fort Albany to the fort at Pennicooke and informed them that all the Mohawkes did de|clare they would kill all Indians from Uncas at mount Hope to the ea&s;tward as far as Pegyp&s;cut.</P>
<P N="2">2. The rea&s;on of Natombamat, &s;agamore of Saco, departed his place was, becau&s;e the &s;ame news was brought there as him&s;elf declared upon reading my orders at Pennicooke.</P>
<P N="3">3. Natombamat, &s;agamore of Saco, is gone to carry the In|dians downe to the &s;ame place where they were before depart|ed from us, on Sunday morninge, and de&s;ired Capt. Hooke to meet him at Saco five days after.</P>
<P N="4">4. Both &s;agamores of Pennicook, viz. Wannilan&s;et and Me|&s;andowit, the latter of which is come downe, did then declare they had no intention of war, neither indeed are they in any po&s;ture for war, beinge about 24 men be&s;ides &s;quaws and papo&s;es.</P>
<P N="5">5. A&s;king the rea&s;on why they did not come among the Engli&s;h as formerly, they an&s;wered they thought if the Mo|hawkes came and fought them and they &s;hould fly for &s;uccour to the Engli&s;h, that then the Mohawkes would kill all the Engli&s;h for harboring them.</P>

<P>That while we were thus defending our&s;elves and families, again&s;t the common enemy of the repo&s;e of all your maje&s;ty's Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in the plantations abroad as well as in Europe, we were pur&s;ued by the challenge of Mr. Allen for the lands and &s;oil under our feet, which we have this &s;ixty years defend|ed with our lives and e&s;tates, as well as the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our good neighbours of your maje&s;ty's colony of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, your maje&s;ty of your royal and princely regard to us has di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> challenge, which will forever encourage us to our utmo&s;t power to defend this your maje&s;ty's province, &s;ince we may now hope to leave our children in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, with an entire dependance upon your maje&s;ty and your royal &s;ucce&s;&s;ors without the danger of any further unju&s;t challenge from tho&s;e per&s;ons that have &s;o long di&s;turbed us with their claims.</P>
<P>And whereas your maje&s;ty out of a gracious regard to this and other your provinces in the&s;e parts of America, was plea&s;ed to form a de&s;ign again&s;t the French &s;ettlements at Canada and Nova-Scotia the la&s;t &s;ummer, but a more important &s;ervice in Europe requiring your maje&s;ty's forces which were intended hither, whereby that de&s;ign is laid a&s;ide for the pre&s;ent; we mo&s;t humbly pray your maje&s;ty that it may con&s;i&s;t with your royal plea&s;ure to revive the &s;aid de&s;ign, and that the expediti|on lately intended may be pro&s;ecuted &s;ea&s;onably the next &s;pring; and that your maje&s;ty's arms in America may have a glorious &s;ucce&s;s as in Europe, to the utter confu&s;ion of your enemies, and la&s;ting repo&s;e of all your maje&s;ty's good &s;ubjects inhabiting this continent.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxxiv" REF="018344_0452_0FA5D1B9E440DA70">We mo&s;t humbly render our everla&s;ting prai&s;es to Almighty God for your maje&s;ty's mo&s;t glorious &s;ucce&s;&s;es again&s;t the tyran|ny and u&s;urpation of the French king and heartily pray for your maje&s;ty's long life and happy reign and the continnuance of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, for the benefit of your maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects of Great Britain, of all your maje&s;ty's dominions and plantations, and of all Europe who have had the un&s;peakable benefit of your maje&s;ty's unparalleled reign.</P>
