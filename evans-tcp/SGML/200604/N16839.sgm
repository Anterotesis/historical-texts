<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE thir&s;t for Novelty is unextingui&s;hable. The human mind is of &s;uch exqui&s;ite &s;u&s;ceptibility, as to be in&s;atiable to variety; hence it is the good peo|ple of this town have more than once di&s;covered their avidity to gratify this pa&s;&s;ion or affection by in&s;tantly &s;natching up new&s;papers, magazines, and even <HI>farces.</HI> Some people may perhaps attribute this eagerne&s;s in pur&s;uit of literary entertainment to a <HI>love of &s;candal.</HI> With what greater degree of truth, might this be im|puted to a de&s;ire of &s;omething <HI>new!</HI>&mdash;I have the charity to &s;uppo&s;e this may be one of the cau&s;es which prompt the publick to buy new publications, not to &s;ay any thing of encouraging the Art of Printing&mdash;the boa&s;t of Americans&mdash;the palladium of liberty&mdash;and the cream of the Con&s;titution. Sorry I am to add that this eager &s;olicitude in a generous publick has oftentimes been ill requited; it has been requited with a farcical repre&s;entation of a few heterogeneous incidents, thrown together with <HI>injudicious ha&s;te,</HI> and prompted &s;olely by the lucre of gain&mdash;a few private anecdotes have been in&s;erted in the&s;e pages, but without in&s;truction, without even amu&s;ement for their aim, they have obtained, for the rea&s;on above cited, a temporary reception; but not de&s;erving a repo&s;itory in the library of Curio&s;ity, or even in the memory of Slander, they have &s;ilently rolled down

the &s;tream of time into the dull lake of oblivion. The dramatick &s;tyle is univer&s;ally allowed to be a u&s;eful channel for conveying in&s;truction to all cla&s;&s;es of citi|zens&mdash;and though a <HI>new play</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily loo&s;e a great part of its effect, becau&s;e the <HI>advantage of action</HI>
is &s;hut out, yet a candid mind will doubtle&s;s and nev|erthele&s;s <HI>receive the &s;eed into good ground</HI>; the <HI>good humour</HI> of the reader mu&s;t therefore &s;upply the <HI>comick humour</HI> of an actor. Whence it appears that a <HI>Farci|cal Opera</HI> pre&s;ented to the American &s;tates at this junc|ture, mu&s;t be a very <HI>u&s;eful work.</HI> The following <HI>work,</HI> therefore, is now offered to the candour, and for the amu&s;ement and edification of the credulous publick. A publick whom I call <HI>credulous</HI> becau&s;e they have generally purcha&s;ed books of this kind before they took the trouble to examine them. If then they have been cheated by the empty &s;ound of a title, the que&s;tion is, <HI>How ought a Farce to be written.</HI> I can an&s;wer the que&s;tion in no better way than by encouraging the reader diligently to peru&s;e, what he now &s;eeth before him. In a more e&s;pecial manner will his good nature be awakened, when he finds that the conver&s;ation of the parties tends to &s;ome general point, that the <HI>unities</HI> of the Drama are not altogether violated, and that a PLOT is pur&s;ued and brought about, all which mu&s;t provoke his patience to read the&s;e fifty pages clean through.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>FATHER.</SPEAKER>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At the Comick Opera I have &s;ometimes &s;een action alone excite the highe&s;t applau&s;e, independent of either the poetry or the mu&s;ick. I &s;aw a Duo performed by an old man and a young woman, &s;uppo&s;ed to be his daughter, in &s;uch an humourous manner, as drew an uni|ver&s;al <HI>enchore</HI> from the &s;pectators. The merit of the mu&s;ical part of the compo&s;ition, I was told, was but very moderate, and as for &s;enti|ment you &s;hall judge.</P>
<P>The father informs his daughter, in a &s;ong, that he has found an excellent match for her; who, be&s;ides being rich, and very prudent, and not too young, was over and above a particular friend of his own, and, in per&s;on and di&s;po&s;ition, much &s;uch a man as him&s;elf; he con|cludes, by telling her, that the ceremony will be performed next day. She thanks him, in the gaye&s;t air po&s;&s;ible, for his obliging intentions, adding, that &s;he &s;hould have been glad to have &s;hewn her implicit obe|dience to his commands, provided there had been any chance of the man's being to her ta&s;te; but as, from the account he had given, there could be none, &s;he declares &s;he will not marry him next day, and adds, with a <HI>very long</HI> quaver, that if &s;he were to live to <HI>eternity,</HI> &s;he &s;hould continue of the &s;ame opinion. The father, in a violent rage, tells her, that in&s;tead of tomorrow, the marriage &s;hould take place that very day; to which &s;he replies, Non; he rejoins, Si; &s;he, Non, non; he, Si, &s;i; the daughter, Non, non, non; the father, Si, &s;i, &s;i; and &s;o the &s;inging continues for five or &s;ix minutes. You perceive there is noth|ing marvelou&s;ly witty in this; and for a daughter to be of a different opinion from her father, in the choice of a hu&s;band, is not a very new dramatick incident. Well, I told you the Duo was encored&mdash;they im|mediately performed it a &s;econd time, and with more humour than the fir&s;t. The whole hou&s;e vociferated for it again; and it was &s;ung a third time, in a manner equally plea&s;ant, and yet perfectly different from any of the former two.</P>
<P>I thought the hou&s;e would have been brought down about our ears, &s;o extravagant were the te&s;timonies of approbation.</P>
<P>The two actors were obliged to appear again, and &s;ing this Duo a fourth time; which they executed in a &s;tyle &s;o new, &s;o natural, and &s;o exqui&s;itely droll, that the audience now thought there had been &s;ome|thing deficient in all their former performances, and that they had hit on the true comick only this la&s;t time.</P>
<P>Some people began to call for it again; but the old man, now quite exhau&s;ted, begged for mercy; on which the point was given up. I never had any idea that &s;uch &s;trong comick powers could have been di&s;played in &s;inging a &s;ong.&mdash;MOORE'S ITALY, vol. i. page 222, &amp;c.</P></NOTE> Dear daughter, &s;ince wedlock's the bal&s;am of life,</L>
