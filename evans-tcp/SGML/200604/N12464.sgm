<P>LET not the word <HI>&s;cripture,</HI> in the title page, prevent that general attention to the&s;e di&s;|cour&s;es which they might otherwi&s;e receive. I know it is natural for us to be cautious in looking into any thing that borders on religion, le&s;t we &s;hould meet with &s;ome &s;ly in&s;inuation <HI>like a bayon|et-point to dart upon the con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, in the very <HI>patibulo,</HI> or entrance, I am careful to a&s;&s;ure my countrymen, that the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es are what they pretend to be, <HI>of a na|ture chiefly political.</HI></P>
<P>They were written at different times, &s;ince the opening of the la&s;t campaign in Penn&s;ylvania, and were intended for the military. The three fir&s;t were delivered on &s;ome occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>If they &s;hall now more generally &s;erve the great cau&s;e in which we are engaged, it will be an am|ple recompence for the time &s;pent in tran&s;cribing them for publication</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IT is very u&s;ual in any lan|guage, when we mean to draw a character to the high|e&s;t point, to compare it with one already known, and con|fe&s;&s;edly eminent in virtue, or in vice. This is the ground, of the expre&s;&s;ion in this place, woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain&mdash;</P>
<P>Cain, we know, was a bloody-minded man. The fiercene&s;s of his nature, did very early &s;hew it&s;elf, in great vehemency of pa&s;&s;ion, and in the &s;ullen gloom of a re&s;erved countenance. He was very wroth, and his countenance was fallen. No wonder, for he was indeed a very bloody man. He &s;hed the fir&s;t blood that ever crim&s;oned the earth. He bathed his hands in a brother's blood. The&s;e two circum&s;tances of his guilt, place him fir&s;t, in the line of murderers. He is &s;o infamou&s;|ly
<PB N="6" REF="015748_0006_0F9A26EBE9392190">
famous, that when we mean to &s;ay of any one, that he is fierce and &s;avage to a high degree, we may &s;trike off his character at once, by &s;aying, he hath gone in the way of Cain.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not detain you, with a longer introduc|tion, but proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">I. What it is to go in the way of Cain.</P>
<P N="2">II. Who are they, who have mo&s;t eminently, gone in the way of Cain.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, conclude with &s;omething in the &s;pirit of the&s;e words&mdash;Woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain.</P>
<P N="1">I. What it is to go in the way of Cain. It is to give indulgence, in the lea&s;t unlawful mea&s;ure, to the anger and re&s;entment of the brea&s;t; for who|&s;o hateth his brother, is a murderer. The evil principles of envy, malice, and ambition, like &s;o many younger Cains, lurk within the brea&s;t, and wait only for an opportunity to &s;hew them&s;elves in ac|tion. The evil principles of envy, and ambition, lead to murder; for they &s;eek to end in the death of tho&s;e, who &s;tand in the way of the propo&s;ed ri&s;e, and &s;trike not readily to their &s;uperior greatne&s;s. Hence it is, that the tyrant makes war upon his own, or the neighbouring nation, be|cau&s;e they refu&s;e to live precariou&s;ly by his boun|ty, and to hold their property, liberty, and life, intirely at his di&s;po&s;al. It is the nature of the wicked heart of man, to de&s;ire ab&s;olute dominion. Let a wicked man be made a magi&s;trate, and he will de&s;ire to be &s;upreme in office; and if &s;upreme by the appointment of his countrymen, he will a&s;pire to unre&s;trained authority; and in order to acquire de&s;potic rule, he will not he&s;itate to &s;hed the blood of kin&s;men, friends and fellow-citizens. This is to go in the way of Cain&mdash;To &s;hed blood like him, and to take the &s;ame character up|on the earth&mdash;But I am to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="015748_0007_0F9A26ED34897E50">II. Who are they who have mo&s;t eminently gone in the way of Cain. I need not tell you, that &s;uch is the degeneracy of human nature, that we all, &s;ome time or other, have gone lengths in the way of Cain. The rich man hates him that is richer than him&s;elf, becau&s;e he is unwilling that any one &s;hould be equal or &s;uperior to him, in the &s;ame line of eminence. The learned for the &s;ame rea&s;on, hates him that is more learned &s;till, and the candidate for office, hates the brother candidate. A temper of this ca&s;t, is not &s;o rare, as men unattentive to them&s;elves and to others, may &s;uppo&s;e it. What man is there among us, who is not con&s;cious to him&s;elf, of having too much indulged the pa&s;&s;ion of re&s;entment again&s;t a brother, from &s;ome im|proper cau&s;e and principle? What man is there among us who has not found in him&s;elf a &s;enti|ment of &s;ome revenge again&s;t a brother, becau&s;e he had not &s;ubmitted to him in a di&s;pute in con|ver&s;ation, or in a competition for a magi&s;tracy, or place of public tru&s;t and appointment of &s;ome kind or other? Every man has his ambition, and in the fru&s;tration of this particular hope, by the competition of a rival, he is vulnerable. The lady envies dre&s;s, precedency, and degrees of honour in the &s;phere peculiar to her&s;elf. The gentleman is troubled at the mention of &s;uperior fame, in wealth, wit, learning, or honour in &s;ome other way. Envy, malice, hatred and revenge may be found in &s;ome degree, at &s;ome time or other, in al|mo&s;t every brea&s;t. We have therefore all proceed|ed frequently too much, in the way of Cain.&mdash; But,</P>
<P>Who are they who have mo&s;t eminently gone, in the way of Cain? From the day that Cain &s;lew Abel, to the pre&s;ent hour, there have been many, who have gone in the &s;ame path of blood, concern|ing whom hi&s;tory is &s;ilent. One half the wick|edne&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="015748_0008_0F9A26ED697DFE78">
mankind is buried in oblivion. From the day of Cain to the deluge, we have particularly, the name but of one man, who &s;hed human blood. Lamech, by his own confe&s;&s;ion, &s;lew a man to his wounding, and a young man to his hurt; and with &s;uch circum&s;tance of aggravation, that in his own judgment, he had de&s;erved a puni&s;hment &s;eventy-fold greater than the puni&s;hment of Cain. In this long period we have the name but of Lamech on record, though, no doubt, there were many more who &s;hed the blood of man. The earth at this time was filled with violence&mdash;with contention, with havock, with war and blood-&s;hed in every place. Many an unju&s;t tyrant &s;ought dominion, and obtained it by the death of thou&s;ands. Such was the &s;cene of things before the flood: But by and by, the &s;acred hi&s;tory, more and more unfolds it|&s;elf, and we begin to &s;ee many, very many, to take the character of Cain upon the earth. Nimrod fir&s;t began to be a mighty one; that is, as we may con|jecture, one who fir&s;t at the head of a &s;mall band made him&s;elf famous, but &s;hortly dared to u&s;urp dominion over others, that were not willing to al|low it. But as we have nothing more explicit con|cerning him, I pa&s;s him by, and come down to a more remarkable per&s;onage, even Pharoah king of Egypt, who went with ha&s;ty &s;teps, and to a great length in the way of Cain. I might &s;ay a great deal of this bloody man, and &s;et in high colours, the complexion of his crime, who to the &s;lavery of the father, added the infant &s;on's death. But I leave this in&s;tance in my view, and likewi&s;e all that hap|pened to the cho&s;en people, under the tyrants, that made war upon them, after their &s;ettlement in the promi&s;ed land. I leave behind me the cruelty of many of their own kings, and in particular the bloody tragedy of Ahab, who took the life of Na|both, for the &s;ake of the poor man's vineyard,
<PB N="5" REF="015748_0009_0F9A26EE2BAF1EE8">
upon which he had fixed his covetous de&s;ire. I leave behind me the inroad of the Syrians, and all that the Chaldean monarch did, when he tran&s;planted the ten tribes from their own land, to a di&s;tant coun|try. I come down to profane hi&s;tory, and there I likewi&s;e leave behind me, all that is told us of the mighty captains and conquerers of ancient time&mdash; the Alexanders&mdash;the Cae&s;ars&mdash;the Jengi&s;chans&mdash;the Tamarlanes. I leave behind me, all that is related of the Hun, the Vandal, or the Goth, and all the cruel, per&s;ecuting, bloody princes, and people in more modern times, when Europe floated as one &s;ea of blood. I pa&s;s them by, and ha&s;ten on, for I have an object of greater wickedne&s;s in view&mdash;an object of &s;uch accompli&s;hed fraud, perfidy, and murder, that every one heretofore mentioned, is lo&s;t and di&s;appears. I mean him of England&mdash;the fierce, cruel, unrelenting, and bloody king of Britain. What has this tyrant done? What has he not done?</P>
<P>He meditated with him&s;elf in cold blood, and be|fore he had the lea&s;t foundation of re&s;entment, the en&s;laving of this ri&s;ing country. He could view with|out a tear, &amp; without one check of con&s;cience, this early land, bound in the chains of &s;ervitude, which he forged for it. This was the pro&s;pect, which he had painted to his own imagination. It was this which he endeavoured to accompli&s;h, by the in&s;i|duous, and as he hoped in&s;en&s;ible gradation of a &s;low approach, in bribery, and flattering promi&s;es to vain per&s;ons, and then by di&s;tant acts of parlia|ment, that did not &s;eem immediately to involve the lo&s;s of freedom, but did by &s;ure &s;teps lead to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Tho&s;e that are mo&s;t &s;kilful in the art of po<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">on|ing, make u&s;e of a &s;low bane, which wa&s;tes the &s;y&s;|tem gradually, and is not di&s;cernable in its opera|tion, from a natural di&s;ea&s;e. Such was the fir&s;t attempt of the king of Britain. But when it failed him to accompli&s;h our de&s;truction by this,
<PB N="10" REF="015748_0010_0F9A26EEE95D9D68">
which might be called a &s;ap, with what compo|&s;ure did did he determine with him&s;elf, to drench with &s;laughter, and imbrue the continent in blood. With what continued and unbroken ob&s;tinacy, hath he per&s;evered in the de&s;ign. Let the &s;treets of Bo&s;ton, and the bloody fifth of March, be wit|ne&s;s of his cruelty, when &s;everal lovely and unre|&s;i&s;ting youths fell by the hands of the bloody Pre&s;ton, who acted the &s;avage plea&s;ure, of his &s;till more &s;avage ma&s;ter. Let the &s;treets that were wet with this blood, and drank it not, for the blood ran down upon the &s;tones.&mdash;Let the &s;treets that were wet, and ran down with this blood, &s;peak loud of it, and cry to heaven for a day of vengeance. Let the town of Bo&s;ton be witne&s;s to their cruel|ty.&mdash;The town of Bo&s;ton with the cries of infants, and the groans of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mothers, detained from their relatives and hu&s;bands, by the perfidy of Gage, in violation of his plighted faith. Let the heights of Bo&s;ton, naked of the &s;i&s;ter town, which &s;tood upon them, be witne&s;s of the cruelty of Bri|tain. Let the&s;e call to mind, and &s;hew the graves of the brave men, who fell fighting gallantly, for the noble cau&s;e of freedom. Let the&s;e be witne&s;s to the tyranny, and at the &s;ame time, &s;ome part of the puni&s;hment of Britain; for the heroes &s;aw them&s;elves revenged, and &s;lept not in death, untill fifteen hundred of the foe, lay vanqui&s;hed on the &s;oil. Let the heights of Canada, and the environs of Quebec, call to mind, and publi&s;h the bloody ve&s;tiges of tyran|ny, in that unhappy country. Like the heights of Gilboa, let them be ever recollected, for there the blood of a Montgomery flowed upon the plain. Like the blood of Abel, it &s;hall cry from the ho&s;tile ground, and God &s;hall require it of the George of England, as he required the like blood of Cain, &s;ay|ing, where is my Montgomery, who once drew his &s;word in thy defence, before the&s;e very walls&mdash;who
<PB N="11" REF="015748_0011_0F9A26EFAA8B1148">
continued faithful, until the hand of tyranny was &s;tretched to de&s;troy? From the heights of Canada, to the di&s;tant barrier of Fort Sullivan, let the in|termediate &s;tates, give in remembrance, to remote&s;t times, what they have &s;uffered, from the He&s;&s;ian ravi&s;her, and from the inroad of the cruel Engli&s;h|man, wa&s;ting their plantations. Let the Jer&s;ey &s;tate be witne&s;s to their ve&s;tiges. Let the blood of Ha&s;ler, on the plain of Princeton, cry aloud to God for a day of retribution. Let the fourteen wounds of Mercer, with the bayonet-point, on the &s;ame vic|torious eminence, open their dumb mouths afre&s;h, and cry aloud for ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But omitting tho&s;e who fell in the field of battle, let the unhappy pri&s;oners of the &s;tates declare what they have &s;uffered from the tyrant.&mdash;Let the pri&s;on|ers of Fort Wa&s;hington, relate the hunger, cold, and every &s;hape of mi&s;ery to which they were con&s;igned. Sick, emaciated, dying, let them tell, if by their la&s;t breath, they can give &s;ome faint account of it, How for many days they ta&s;ted not food, until &s;harp famine began to prey upon their vitals, and de&s;troy the love of life.&mdash;How for many months they were detained, in the wintry and inclement &s;ea&s;on of the year, comfortle&s;s, in cold rooms, and without fire, until the blood of the body lo&s;t its motion in the veins. Let them tell the quality and pernicious ta&s;te, of that unwhole&s;ome food, which was &s;erved to them, and intended for their death. This let tho&s;e who &s;uffered &s;peak; but we can te&s;tify, what was the appearance and lamentable &s;tate, of the meagre, faint and heart-dejected few, who for a time &s;urvived the u&s;age, and at length to &s;ave &s;ome pretence of an exchange, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the fangs of &s;uch barbarity. We &s;aw them&mdash; oh &s;pectacle of horror and commi&s;eration! the legs &s;wollen, and from the ancle to the knee, of an equal &s;hape&mdash;the belly contracted to the ribs&mdash;the
<PB N="12" REF="015748_0012_0F9A26F06B861ED0">
eye &s;unk, and hid within the head&mdash;the vi&s;age nar|row&mdash;the cheeks fallen to the bone&mdash;the voice &s;hrill, feeble, and not to be di&s;tinctly heard&mdash;the dre&s;s ragged and &s;carcely hanging on the body. A&s;k one of the&s;e, what became of his companion, whom we &s;ee not? He died the fir&s;t week partly with hunger and partly with the cold. He recom|mended his wife, and infant children, to God, and his death to be revenged by his country. What became of another whom we &s;ee not? He died the &s;econd week on board the &s;hips, by the badne&s;s, and, as we &s;uppo&s;e, poi&s;on of the food, which was &s;erved to us. He hoped that the God of heaven and the freemen of his country would call the tyrant to account for this. What became of another known to us, but whom we &s;ee not now among&s;t you? He died the third, the fourth, the fifth, or the &s;ixth week of our captivity. He, with twenty more, was found dead, one morning, among&s;t our feet. They had peri&s;hed with cold, being without covering in the night. Many, very many peri&s;hed every day. The carriage for the dead, came, eve|ry morning, to the door. From twenty-five or twenty-&s;even hundred, we are now reduced to twelve, and of the twelve hundred that were &s;uf|fered to depart, not perhaps one hundred worn out with &s;ickne&s;s, which cold and famine had pro|duced, are now alive.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, great has been the cruelty of this infernal tyrant; but to add to this, let the pri&s;oners taken by his pyrates on the &s;ea, be witne&s;s of his horrid depredation. Let the pri&s;oners &s;ent by him to India, and the burning i&s;lands of the ea&s;t, be witne&s;s of his inhumanity. There hath he purpo|&s;ed to &s;end&mdash;There hath he &s;ent our brethren and our fellow-&s;oldiers in the common cau&s;e. There hath he &s;ent them, di&s;tant far, and hopele&s;s from their native land, to antichri&s;tian &s;ettlements and pagan|i&s;h
<PB N="13" REF="015748_0013_0F9A26F12A2F7810">
domains. There hath he &s;ent our countrymen, beyond tho&s;e &s;ettlements, and &s;olitary &s;treams, at which the captive Hebrew &s;at, and hung his harp upon the willow-tree; for mu&s;ic &s;uited not in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s. There many a poor American may &s;it this day, forlorn, and deeply melancholy, in a di&s;tant clime. There may they &s;it, far on the Cape of Comorin, or on the Malabar or Coromandel &s;hore, looking we&s;tward o'er the main, to the &s;et|ting &s;un, where their native country lies. There may they &s;it and look in vain; for the tyrant hath &s;entenced them, though fairly pri&s;oners in war, to this unpitied &s;tate. This hath he done, and this hath he purpo&s;ed to do, while we have treated tho&s;e of the enemy, who by the chance of war, have fallen into our hands, with every exerci&s;e of tenderne&s;s, compa&s;&s;ion, and humanity. This we have done, but as for them, they have gone in the way of Cain.</P>
<P>This hath come more immediately in later in|&s;tances before our eyes. Their &s;ad cruelties are now tran&s;acted on our own plains. They have landed&mdash;they have travelled through a part of the adjacent country&mdash;they have burned dwelling-hou&s;es&mdash;they have de&s;troyed provi&s;ion and the means of life&mdash;they have tortured for money, tho&s;e whom they &s;u&s;pected of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it&mdash;they have driven the peaceful inhabitants from their places of abode&mdash;they have violated the cha&s;tity of women who fell into their hands&mdash;they are bend|ing on and breathing &s;laughter to the whole &s;tate. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI></NOTE> They meditate de&s;truction, at the ri&s;k of their own lives. It is their determination to de|&s;troy or to peri&s;h. Rather than &s;uffer us to live, they will cea&s;e to live them&s;elves. Can any thing be more diabolical &mdash; more &s;trongly marked infer|nal&mdash;more in the &s;pirit of the fir&s;t-born Cain?</P>
<P>I conclude, with &s;omething in the &s;pirit of the
<PB N="14" REF="015748_0014_0F9A26F1EBA581F8">
words; woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain. In the language of a &s;oldier, too often and very iniquitou&s;ly u&s;ed, it might be &s;aid damn them; but &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion is not to be com|mended. Let our re&s;entment be levelled again&s;t their practice, and let our execution be &s;tayed on their bodies, but let us &s;pare the &s;oul. Let us wi&s;h them &s;piritual happine&s;s; but let every thought and exerci&s;e of mind draw forth it &s;elf again&s;t their conduct. Let us endeavour to conceive with &s;trength the ba&s;ene&s;s of their crime; and let us &s;peak to others what we have conceived, &s;o that we may fix the dete&s;tation of it beyond a po&s;&s;ibili|ty to be era&s;ed This is laudable, for a ju&s;t and ho|ne&s;t indignation again&s;t any vice or evil practice, is an evidence of virtue. This is nece&s;&s;ary, for we are too apt to lo&s;e our hatred of evil, from a fami|liarity and acquaintance with it. Hence it is that they who are once en&s;laved, do very &s;eldom exert them&s;elves, to &s;hake off the bondage. It is in this as it is &s;aid to be in the charm of a &s;erpent&mdash;We fall in love with that which ought to be the object of our hate, as it is the in&s;trument of our de&s;truc|tion. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to beget, increa&s;e, and keep alive an aver&s;ion from it&mdash;To inkindle our re&s;entment, not by cur&s;es and indecent lan|guage, but by &s;en&s;ible remon&s;trances to our &s;elves and with each other. Let it be woven in our daily conver&s;ation; woe unto them for they have intend|ed to en&s;lave us&mdash;They have intended to &s;ubjugate us to their empire&mdash;To make us hewers of wood, and drawers of water, and in every ba&s;e employ|ment, va&s;&s;als to their de&s;potic power. By this they have intended to prevent the growth of every art and &s;cience in this country; for without freedom, learning &s;hall decay and no art can flouri&s;h.

<Q><P>&mdash;And ran greedily after the error of Balaam, for reward.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ONE remarkable character, recorded in the &s;a|cred hi&s;tory, is that of Cain, who thro' envy of the accepted &s;acrifice, &s;hed his brother's blood. Another, not a whit behind him, in malignity of di&s;po&s;ition, is Balaam, the &s;on of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. If it may be &s;aid of the fierce tyrant and his bloody &s;oldiery, that they have gone in the way of Cain; with no le&s;s proprie|ty, it may be &s;aid of a certain cla&s;s among&s;t our|&s;elves, that they have ran greedily after the error of Balaam, for reward.</P>
<P>This will abundantly appear, if we con&s;ider in a few words,</P>
<P N="1">1. What was the error of Balaam.</P>
<P N="2">2. Who are they who have ran mo&s;t greedily, according to the &s;ame error.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, what is the reward, which they have in view, as the ground of this pernicious conduct.</P>
<P N="1">1. What was the error of Balaam? In order to illu&s;trate this, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay a little of
<PB N="18" REF="015748_0018_0F9A26F4EBD3F880">
his birth, education, character and &s;tory. We have rea&s;on to believe he was of the family of Shem; for he was of Aram &s;o called, as is mo&s;t probable, from Aram, the &s;on of Shem, who fir&s;t &s;ettled in that country. If &s;o, he was collaterally related to the I&s;raelites; for the&s;e, by Abraham, the patriarch, were de&s;cended from Arphaxad, who was likewi&s;e the &s;on of Shem. Uz was the elde&s;t &s;on of Aram, and gave name to a di&s;trict of country, wa&s;hed by the Euphrates, and bordering upon Aram. Job liv|ed in the land of Uz, and was probably of his po&s;|terity. Job and Balaam, therefore, may have been related in &s;ome degrees of con&s;anguinity. They lived, it is probable, nearly about the &s;ame period; for Mo&s;es, a few years before this time, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have written the book of Job. The country of Midian, where Mo&s;es kept the flock of Jethro, is not &s;o far di&s;tant from the land of Uz, where Job lived, but that he might be well acquainted with the &s;ufferings of this good man, which for the &s;up|port of the Hebrews in affliction, he may have drawn up in dramatic narrative, as we now have it in the &s;acred canon.</P>
<P>Be the&s;e particulars as they may, with re&s;pect to the family of Balaam, the matter is more certain relative to his education. He was brought up, no doubt, in the knowledge of the true God; for the church was continued in the family of Shem; and though from him it &s;pread it&s;elf principally in the line of Abraham, yet the other branches were not left wholly de&s;titute of &s;aving light. Job had the kowledge of the true God, and the ceremonies of his wor&s;hip pure and unmixed with the &s;uper&s;tition of the neighbouring nations. He was acquainted with the &s;acred hi&s;tory, by tradition, as is mo&s;t pro|bable, from Adam, Seth, Noah and the other aged fathers of antiquity. This appears from that ex|pre&s;&s;ion: "If I have hid my iniquity in my bo&s;om,
<PB N="19" REF="015748_0019_0F9A26F5A97A7C08">
or covered my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion like Adam." Balaam, who, as we have &s;aid, was co-temporary with Job, enjoyed the &s;ame opportunities of information, handed down in the &s;ame family. The knowledge of the true God was not yet wholly lo&s;t in that ea&s;tern country. It was not wholly lo&s;t, many ages after, at the coming of our Saviour; for it was from Me&s;opotamia, a di&s;trict bordering to this, and touch|ing the Euphrates, that the wi&s;e men came, who had &s;een his &s;tar in the ea&s;t&mdash;The very &s;tar of which Ba|laam had prophe&s;ied, as about to ari&s;e out of Juda. This &s;tar was prefigurative of the Me&s;&s;iah; and it argues &s;ome knowledge of Chri&s;t about to come, that the&s;e men paid attention to it.</P>
<P>With regard to the particular character of this &s;o celebrated and extraordinary per&s;on, there is a great variety of judgments and conjectures. Some &s;uppo&s;e him to have been a necromancer, and that by his &s;kill in magic he was able to do wonders. They think it probable that he had &s;ome &s;maller devil, or familiar &s;pirit, to wait upon him, and ac|quaint him with contingencies; &s;o that it was no great difficulty for him, to progno&s;ticate the fate and i&s;&s;ue of any undertaking. I am of opinion that were it even &s;o, that he had formed an intimacy with the devil, yet it would have availed him very little towards the knowledge of a future circum|&s;tance; for I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that &s;atan cannot &s;ee an inch before his no&s;e into futurity, more than other people. It is therefore to me un|doubtedly e&s;tabli&s;hed, that Balaam was a prophet of the true God, and had his in&s;piration from the &s;ource that knoweth time, and chance, and all things. Yet I do not mean to &s;ay that he was a good and pious per&s;on. The contrary, is for him&s;elf, unhappy man! but too plainly evident; for though his language was &s;ometimes that of orthodox religion, yet his conduct was, in many
<PB N="20" REF="015748_0020_0F9A26F66A234310">
places, very much its oppo&s;ite. The&s;e words are very good, and &s;avour of devotion. "I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord to do le&s;s or more;" yet it is evident from the particulars of his &s;tory, that it was not becau&s;e the love and fear of God re&s;trained him, but becau&s;e in this ca&s;e he was de|nied the gift and &s;pirit of prophe&s;y.</P>
<P>His &s;tory is as follows. The fame of one &s;o emi|nent and &s;ingular in the world, had penetrated to the neighbouring countries. He had, in &s;eve|ral in&s;tances foretold the good or bad about to come to individuals, and &s;o was thought of by the multitude, as one who mu&s;t have had &s;ome hand in the good or bad which had befallen agreeable to his prediction. The notion of a &s;pell, a charm, or a enchantment, is of very early origin. The king of Moab had heard of him and of his power in this capacity; and as he was at that time ex|ceedingly unea&s;y by rea&s;on of the I&s;raeliti&s;h na|tion, which in their journey through the wilder|ne&s;s, had encamped upon his border, he ca&s;ts about for &s;ome expedient to &s;upport him&s;elf again&s;t them. He bethinks him of the prophet who was &s;aid to have &s;ome admirable power upon the e&s;tates of men, and on the human mind and body. He &s;ends a deputation of his wi&s;e&s;t princes, in company with the &s;enators of Midian. The emba&s;&s;y was flatter|ing, and the me&s;&s;age not le&s;s &s;o, for &s;ays the prince "I wot that he whom thou ble&s;&s;ed&s;t, is ble&s;&s;ed; and he whom thou cur&s;ed&s;t, is cur&s;ed." Yet notwith|&s;tanding this in&s;inuating language, and the promi&s;e of a rich reward, the prophet is obliged to confe&s;s that they &s;olicit him in vain; for that it was not in his power to do them any &s;ervice. An emba&s;&s;y more honourable, waits on him a &s;econd time. His an|&s;wer is of equal import; but withal he bids them &s;tay with him that night; and in the morning he &s;hould more di&s;tinctly know, what he could do for
<PB N="21" REF="015748_0021_0F9A26F729CC93A8">
them. No doubt, he was very earne&s;t in his &s;up|plication, that it might be granted him, to do the king this favour. The hope of the preferment, and reward in hard money, for he would take no other, was a great incentive to his importunity. We may believe, he prayed by his bed-&s;ide, more heartily, this evening, for the gold, than he had prayed, at any other time, for grace. "If the men come to call thee, ri&s;e up and go with them." The ha&s;ty prophet catches at the appearance of permi&s;&s;ion; and does not wait, agreeable to the divine command, until the men had come to call him. He is up betimes, and has his a&s;s &s;addled at the door, and is ready to &s;et out upon his journey, probably before the &s;trangers had got out of bed. It was on account of this &s;uch ha&s;te and forward|ne&s;s to go, that the anger of the Lord was &s;o greatly kindled; and the a&s;s opening her mouth miraculou&s;ly in the way, forbade his madne&s;s. I do not mean to give you circum&s;tancially the whole particulars of this incident. It will be equally unnece&s;&s;ary to dwell upon the rite and ceremony of his offering &s;acrifice, which, it is po&s;&s;ible, had &s;omething magi|cal and necromantic in it; for it is &s;aid on one occa|&s;ion, that he went not to &s;eek enchantments, as at other times; that is to offer &s;acrifice, with &s;even altars, and &s;even victims on every altar; or with other rites which he had u&s;ed before. Let it be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that he &s;eems to have had &s;ome hope, by this means to prevail with God to put a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> his mouth, again&s;t this peo|ple; for it is el&s;ewhere &s;aid, "I would not hear|ken to Balaam."</P>
<P>What this wicked per&s;on could not do, as a pro|phet commi&s;&s;ioned by God, he endeavours to ac|compli&s;h by human artifice and &s;tratagem. He gives advice. The Jewi&s;h people, by the courte&s;y and arts of Midianiti&s;h women, are drawn in to &s;in. For this, as it was &s;agaciou&s;ly expected by Ba|laam,
<PB N="22" REF="015748_0022_0F9A26F7EB7F21C0">
who had obtained &s;ome knowledge of their law; the wrath of God came upon them, and there fell in one day, twenty and four thou&s;and. After Balaam had offered &s;acrifice, it appears that he returned to his home. From thence, it is evi|dent that he came again, with a view, mo&s;t pro|bably, to give farther coun&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for in the &s;laughter of the Midianites, he is found a|mong them, and cut to pieces by the &s;word.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee what was the error of Balaam. It was covetou&s;ne&s;s. It was the ba&s;e&s;t avarice. For the &s;ake of a &s;mall increa&s;e of wealth, by the favour of a heathen prince, he was di&s;po&s;ed in his heart, to pronounce a cur&s;e on the people whom God had peculiarly cho&s;en&mdash;a people who had done him no injury, and with whom he had no quarrel&mdash;a people of the &s;ame origin, and of the &s;ame religion with him&s;elf. He was di&s;po&s;ed in his heart to pro|nounce a cur&s;e on this people, though he knew them to have lately &s;uffered from &s;evere&s;t bon|dage; and to have waded through a thou&s;and difficulties, in emerging from this bondage. They had braved the threats of Pharaoh. They had encountered the &s;olitude and famine of the de&s;ert. They had penetrated through the wilderne&s;s. They had waged war with &s;avage kings. They had overcome them; and were now advancing on, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that country, which was ori|ginally their right, and which God had laid out for their inheritance. He was di&s;po&s;ed in his heart, to pronounce a cur&s;e on this people; and if he did not actually, pronounce it, it was becau&s;e God pre|vented him, and turned his cur&s;e into a ble&s;&s;ing. He is forced to cry out, in the language of pro|phetic vi&s;ion, "Surely there is no enchantment again&s;t Jacob; nor is there any divination again&s;t I&s;rael"&mdash;Again&s;t I&s;rael, who&s;e camp was then in view; and who&s;e tents were &s;pread along the val|lies.
<PB N="23" REF="015748_0023_0F9A26F8AB834C28">
This was the error of Balaam. I come to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">II. Who are they who have ran mo&s;t greedily, after or according to the &s;ame error. I might &s;hew that all are naturally too much of &s;uch un|godly di&s;po&s;ition. I might prove it plain, that many who call them&s;elves prote&s;tants and good whigs, are greatly Balaamites at heart. They con|&s;ult their own vain appetite for wealth and honour, more than the will of the mo&s;t high, and the ge|neral good of men. How el&s;e is it, that we hear of &s;o much &s;quabbling for election among competi|tors for tru&s;t and office? How el&s;e is it, that many who have been advanced to honour, civil and mili|tary, do &s;ometimes threaten re&s;ignation, from a chagrin, becau&s;e of inattention to their judgment; or from a pique and jealou&s;y of rank and place. This might be ground of declamation; but I mean in this di&s;cour&s;e to point out tho&s;e who have been mo&s;t greedily the followers of Balaam. Dull as I am, like the a&s;s that &s;poke out in the way, I would, forbid the madne&s;s of this people.</P>
<P>It will not be po&s;&s;ible to recount every in&s;tance of &s;uch abandoned wickedne&s;s, from &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory. It may &s;uffice to &s;elect one more remarkable from &s;cripture, and &s;o come down to recent characters, well known and amply di&s;tin|gui&s;hed among our&s;elves. You will recollect the &s;tory of the Edomite, who drew his &s;word again&s;t the prie&s;ts of Nob, to gratify the malice of the angry Saul. It is probable he apprehended them to be a vile &s;et of Pre&s;byterians. Be this as it will, he drew his &s;word again&s;t them; and from the &s;ame motive with that which operated on Balaam.&mdash;A de&s;ire of favour and reward from a ba&s;e prince. He dared to wage war with heaven, in order to obtain the favour of an earthly ma&s;ter. He ran in the error of Balaam.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="015748_0024_0F9A26F96B91B790">From the &s;tory of the Edomite, let me call your attention to a certain cla&s;s of men, among&s;t our|&s;elves, who have ran greedily, after or according to the &s;ame error. This people have been long known by the name of Tories&mdash;A name originally applied in Ireland, to robbers on the high-way&mdash; afterwards to the pa&s;&s;ive-obedient and non-re&s;i&s;|tant men in England, who had taken part with the &s;econd Charles. For as the robber on the high-way takes a pur&s;e from the unwary and unarmed tra|veller; &s;o the abettors of the tyrant endeavoured to rob the nation of its liberty, a more invaluable ble&s;&s;ing. The lo&s;s of liberty includes the lo&s;s of property, nay a right to life it&s;elf, and all that is dear to the human heart. Such villains were there|fore properly enough denominated Tories. The writers of the pa&s;t age have given us amply an account of them; but what need we con&s;ult writ|ers for what they have &s;aid upon the &s;ubject, &s;ince there are &s;uch originals among&s;t our&s;elves; and we have it in our power to draw from real life the portrait of many ba&s;e per&s;ons, who have acted in the &s;ame abandoned character. Let us en|deavour to review their conduct.</P>
<P>At the commencement of the di&s;pute between Great Britain and the colonies, they made u&s;e of every art to irritate the minds of Engli&s;hmen a|gain&s;t us. They repre&s;ented us as a trouble&s;ome and re&s;tle&s;s people, who were continually hara&s;&s;ing government with our rebellious councils and ca|bals&mdash;As a rich and luxurious people, that were in the mean time unwilling to contribute our propor|tion, to the &s;upport of government. When the de|claration had been made, and the tax was laid upon us, which gave ri&s;e to the fir&s;t remon&s;trances, they endeavoured, by every art and &s;oft &s;urmi&s;e, to &s;ooth us into a lethargic indolence. The lenity, the mildne&s;s, the good intentions of the king were
<PB N="25" REF="015748_0025_0F9A26FA2956B7C8">
at one time the &s;ubject of their declamation. At another time we had them perpetually harangue|ing on the military &s;trength and re&s;i&s;tle&s;s empire of Great Britain. To oppo&s;e her arms was chime|rical; for in the end we mu&s;t be forced to &s;ubmit. Our only way, was to petition very humbly, and by no means to iritate his Maje&s;ty, by &s;eeming to put our&s;elves in the lea&s;t po&s;ture of defence. When every petition had been rejected with di&s;dain, and re&s;i&s;tance was determined, what arts did they not make u&s;e of to divide our Councils and determina|tions? It was a Pre&s;byterian quarrel, and by no means that of the whole continent. The inhabi|tants of Bo&s;ton, doubtle&s;s, had it now in contem|plation to give them&s;elves a king, and commence the tyrants of America. Should they unhappily ac|compli&s;h this, the hanging of the Quakers mu&s;t en|&s;ue, and the unre&s;erved de&s;truction of every other denomination of the people called Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>When language of this nature became &s;u&s;picious, and was noted as a mark of Toryi&s;m, a new cant of villainy and non&s;en&s;e was of nece&s;&s;ity adopted. We might unite&mdash;we might wage war&mdash;but by no means think of independence. A mea&s;ure of this nature would be madne&s;s; for &s;uch were the re|&s;ources of Great-Britain, that &s;he mu&s;t devour us, at lea&s;t in one &s;hort campaign. Ba&s;e and &s;hallow headed men! not to &s;ee that the very rea&s;on urg|ed again&s;t independence, was of equal weight a|gain&s;t our lifting arms at all. If we had not a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, why did we make re&s;i&s;tance? And if in our fir&s;t re&s;i&s;tance we had a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, how &s;hould a &s;tate of independent em|pire take that pro&s;pect from us?</P>
<P>When the declaration of an independent go|vernment, through ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, had taken place; it gave to many, &s;ome plau&s;ible pretence of receding from the a&s;&s;ociation of their country|men.

Many half-way gentlemen, who had endea|voured to &s;teer a middle cour&s;e, took hold of this occa&s;ion, to retire; and plead it in excu&s;e for that enmity again&s;t the common mea&s;ures, which they had hitherto entertained in their hearts, but thought not proper to declare. We thank them for it. We had been heretofore perplexed with them in our committees and a&s;&s;emblies, pretend|ing friend&s;hip; and under this ma&s;k &s;tabbing the be&s;t intere&s;ts of their country.

At another time the paper currency in circulation was &s;o great, and of con&s;equence the debt of the empire &s;o immen&s;e, that we could not hope, at any future period, to be delivered from it. Such ba&s;e calumnies, and &s;uch vain fears were in|du&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread by tho&s;e, who in the mean time, were retained in the capacity of &s;pies to our un|natural and cruel enemies. What was there &s;aid among&s;t us which was not told to the Briti&s;h foe? What was there done which was not communicated to them? From within our very walls they have held a corre&s;pondence with the forces of the ty|rant. They have given them intelligence of our preparations to oppo&s;e them. They have &s;ugge&s;ted them advice, how, and where to invade us. They have been guides to our unnatural foes, in their inroad through the country. They have joined with them in the plunder of the inhabitans. They have

enli&s;ted under the &s;tandard of the tyrant, and have drawn the &s;word again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Thus invariably, from the fir&s;t of our di&s;tre&s;s, by &s;ecret fraud, or open violence, they have endea|voured our de&s;tructon.

<P>Their ance&s;tors, equally with ours, had experi|enced the fierce rage of tyranny, under the Stew|art family, on the throne of England. They had fled from the tyranny of Britain, to &s;eek for &s;helter in the woods, and more ho&s;pitable de&s;erts of Ame|rica. Here, we their offspring, had been born, and brought up together. Here, we had lived friend|ly, and &s;ociably, many years, in the &s;ame town, in the &s;ame village, or by the banks of the &s;ame native river. Their property with ours was equally invaded by the tyrant. The circum&s;tances of our &s;uffering made the cau&s;e common. This, one would have hoped, might have &s;oftened them to &s;ome warm thought

of &s;incere affection. There is a certain tenderne&s;s of the &s;pirit in di&s;tre&s;s, which melts the &s;oul of fel|low-&s;ufferers to &s;ympathy, and expels the lea&s;t idea of envy, or re&s;entment, from the brea&s;t. The great|e&s;t enemies on board a ve&s;&s;el, and peri&s;hing from land, would cea&s;e from variance, and be friendly to each other. The wilde&s;t Indian, in the woods of North-America, attacked by the common enemy, would league him&s;elf, and give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his brothers. The fierce&s;t bea&s;t familiarized with a playful puppy, that tru&s;ts it&s;elf to his &s;ociety, would not devour, or prey upon it. But the&s;e men have out-&s;avaged the Indian, and out-tygered the fierce&s;t bea&s;t that roams upon the mountain. They have forgot the fathers of which we are de|&s;cended. They remember not the town, or village, in which we drew our breath together. They call not to mind the &s;chool at which we had our com|mon education. They have thrown a&s;ide the ten|der name of country. They have rejected the idea of kin&s;men and acquaintance. They have bid de|fiance to the laws of God, and to all that is held &s;acred among&s;t men. They have cur&s;ed the cau&s;e in which we are engaged. They have cur&s;ed the mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary for our &s;afety. They have ran in the error of Balaam. They have ran, for the &s;ame hope of a ba&s;e reward. I am to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3">III. What is the reward which they have in view, as the ground of this pernicious conduct? The favour of the tyrant, is, undoubtedly, the object which plays upon their fancy. They promi&s;e to them&s;elves great felicity, in the glad&s;ome rays of his royal countenance. In his proclamations from his generals, and in his &s;peeches from the throne, he will vouch&s;afe them the heart-chearing appel|ation of my loyal &s;ubjects. When the war is end|ed, and each has acted faithfully his part, he will &s;end for them, and hold them out his hand to
<PB N="29" REF="015748_0029_0F9A26FDAC7AB030">
ki&s;s, at St. James's, in Old England. He will give &s;ome of them commi&s;&s;ions, and admit them to the honour of &s;erving him, in &s;ome capacity about the park, or in the palace yard. One more eminent among the re&s;t, he may con&s;titute his butler; and another, he may graciou&s;ly advance to the office of chief baker. Tho&s;e of them, whom he cannot &s;tow away in this manner, he will provide for, in Ame|rica. He will give them po&s;ts in government. He will reward them for their villainy, with a number of the be&s;t hou&s;es, in &s;ome of our chief cities. He &s;hall &s;atisfy their cravings, with two or three of the forfeited plantations. Some of the more active and leading men among&s;t them, he will pre&s;ent, with ten or fifteen thou&s;and acres; and con&s;titute them lords of &s;ome little manour, on the banks of the Delaware or Schuylkil. He will create them dukes, and earls, and baronets. He will promote them to very great honour, and he will do what&s;o|ever they &s;hall &s;ay unto him. This is what they have in view, as the ground of their pernicious conduct. Avarice, not con&s;cience, is at the bottom of their work. Avarice hath corroded, and eat out the &s;oul of every tory. The &s;oul of each is become degenerate, and, for every good purpo&s;e, u&s;ele&s;s. It is like a &s;word ru&s;ted in the &s;cabbard, and can|not be drawn forth to any thing generous or no|ble. It is like the worm in the grave, and feeds upon the marrow bones of men.</P>
<P>If then, to be a tory is &s;o wicked and dete&s;table a character, let us be careful to avoid that which has the lea&s;t appearance, or re&s;emblance of it. Who is there among us di&s;po&s;ed to hold back, when properly called upon to draw his &s;word in our defence? That man is a tory, though not in the &s;ame degree with him who draws the &s;word again&s;t us. Non-re&s;i&s;tance to the tyrant, is a &s;pecies of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. Who is there among us, who by unnece&s;&s;ary

he&s;itation to comply with the injunctions of the le|gi&s;lature of his &s;tate, weakens the hands of govern|ment, and hinders the cour&s;e of public order? That man is a tory though he know it not, and may not confe&s;s it. Who is there among us, who by a bu&s;y competition at election, con&s;ults his own vain am|bition, and obtains by flattery, and fair &s;peeches, that place to which a per&s;on better qualified, might have been otherwi&s;e appointed? That man is a tory, and ought to be ranked with them. Who is there among us, who by envious and ill-grounded &s;tories, again&s;t tho&s;e in office, endeavours to ob&s;truct the proper cour&s;e and &s;ucce&s;s of the common mea|&s;ures? That man hath &s;omething of the tory in him.</P>
<P>If there is any man among us, who claims the reputation of a true whig, let him cultivate &s;uch general philanthropy, and benevolence of &s;pirit, that he &s;hall ea&s;ily prefer the good of the whole, to his particular honour and preferment. That Spartan was a true whig, who having &s;tood candi|date at an election, and finding him&s;elf out-voted by three hundred of his fellow citizens, came home contentedly; and told his little family, with plea|&s;ure, that he was glad to find, there were three hundred men in Sparta, better than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But in the la&s;t place; if toryi&s;m is &s;o much to be dreaded, and &s;o much to be abhorred, let us &s;train every nerve to di&s;appoint its purpo&s;es, and eradi|cate it from the continent.

<P>THESE words con&s;titute the la&s;t branch of the &s;entence, in which, to the characters already mentioned, is added that of Core, who is equally reprobated in his memory, and handed down as a warning to &s;ucceeding times. With a reference to him, it is &s;aid, proverbially, of men vicious in their lives, and unhappy in their end, that they have peri&s;hed in the gain&s;aying of Core.</P>
<P>That I may apply this to the purpo&s;e, which I have in view, I &s;hall con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">I. What was the gain&s;aying of Core.</P>
<P N="2">II. Who are they, who&s;e language, and proceed|ing, hath been in the &s;ame &s;tile and character.</P>
<P N="3">III. What ground we have to hope, that they &s;hall likewi&s;e peri&s;h in it.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="33" REF="015748_0033_0F9A2700EBBAF628">I. What was the gain&s;aying of Core. In the He|brew language, the name is written Korah; but our tran&s;lators, in this place, have elegantly changed the initial letter; and have given the word an Engli&s;h termination, &s;o that we read it Core. The &s;tory of this wicked and unhappy man, you will recollect, from the &s;acred book; for he was at the head of that abandoned company, who ro&s;e in oppo&s;ition, to the line of order e&s;tabli&s;hed, in the &s;acerdotal office. Aaron, at this time, was the high prie&s;t; and Mo&s;es, in the capacity of chief judge, was ve&s;ted with the civil government. Mo&s;es was him&s;elf of the tribe of Levi, and Aaron's younger brother; and &s;o doubly qualify'd as the &s;econd prie&s;t; and as the chief judge of the Jewi&s;h nation. The prie&s;tly office was by hereditary and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive right, in his father's family; but his au|thority in the civil line, was of God's &s;upreme and immediate appointment. Hence we &s;ee the na|ture of the crime of Core. It was an oppo&s;ition to the will of God, in the per&s;ons of tho&s;e who had been con&s;tituted by him. Envy was at the bottom of the wickedne&s;s of Cain, and avarice was the ruling motive with the &s;on of Beor; but the ambi|tion of a vain heart, &s;eems to have actuated Core. For being him&s;elf of the tribe of Levi, though by a younger brother, he had &s;ome preten&s;ions to the prie&s;thood; or at lea&s;t &s;uch influence among the people, as flattered him with the hope of ea&s;ily ob|taining an equal &s;hare in the admini&s;tration of af|fairs. With this delu&s;ive object in his view, we find him at the head of the above-mentioned con|&s;piracy, addre&s;&s;ing the&s;e words to Mo&s;es and to Aaron. "Ye take too much upon you, &s;eeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them. Wherefore then lift ye up your&s;elves above the congregation of the Lord!" At the&s;e words Mo&s;es falls upon his face; and after|wards,
<PB N="34" REF="015748_0034_0F9A2701A9647B38">
with unexampled moderation, makes reply to this malicious language. He takes it not upon him, to a&s;&s;ert his long e&s;tabli&s;hed authority, confirmed by &s;o many miracles, and countenanced by the pre|&s;ence of the divine Shekinah, in the tabernacle. He rather meekly refers it to God, from whom he had derived his authority, to annul, or to authen|ticate, and &s;o decide between them. He appoints to-morrow for the day of tryal. "And it &s;hall be that he whom the Lord &s;hall choo&s;e, he &s;hall be ho|ly; you take too much upon you, ye &s;ons of Levi." After this, at different times, Mo&s;es &s;eems again to have &s;poken to them; and this in the &s;ofte&s;t and mo&s;t tender language. "Hear, I pray you, ye &s;ons of Levi, &s;eemeth it but a &s;mall thing unto you, that the God of I&s;rael hath &s;eparated you, from the congregation, to bring you near to him&s;elf, to do the &s;ervice of the tabernacle, and to &s;tand before the congregation, to mini&s;ter unto them? He hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren, the &s;ons of Levi with thee; and &s;eek ye the prie&s;t|hood al&s;o? For which cau&s;e thou and all thy com|pany are gathered together again&s;t the Lord, and what is Aaron that ye murmur again&s;t him."</P>
<P>The&s;e words having had no effect upon their minds; he &s;ends for them, as it would &s;eem, to his own tent; and there would willingly have talked the matter over, and have heard their grievances in private. For knowing the judgement about to fall on them, from God, he was compa&s;&s;ionately &s;orry for them, and de&s;irous by every method in his power, to prevent them bringing matters to a tryal which mu&s;t be &s;o fatal to them&s;elves. "Mo|&s;es &s;ent to call Dathan and Abiram, the &s;ons of Eli|ab, who &s;aid we will not come up." It is therefore no wonder, that we find, Mo&s;es, though perhaps for the fir&s;t time, on his own account, was ve|ry wroth, and &s;aid unto the Lord, "Re&s;pect not
<PB N="35" REF="015748_0035_0F9A27026B80BBE8">
thou their offering; I have not taken an a&s;s from them; neither have I hurt one of them."</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee what was the ob&s;tinacy of the&s;e ambitious men. The word u&s;ed in our text, might have been tran&s;lated ob&s;tinacy. It is el&s;ewhere, if I remember properly, rendered contradiction. Chri&s;t is &s;aid to have endured &s;uch contradiction of &s;inners&mdash;that is ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s of di&s;|po&s;ition. They had, no doubt, promi&s;ed them&s;elves a place of greater tru&s;t in government; and it was with this delu&s;ive object in their view, that they rejected all intreaty, and would li&s;ten to no ac|commodation. I am to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">II. Who are they, who&s;e language and proceed|ing, hath been in the &s;ame &s;tate and character. That the worthies may be introduced with proper ceremony, I a&s;k your patience to premi&s;e a few particulars. In the Jewi&s;h theocracy, the legi&s;lature was commi&s;&s;ioned by God; and the evidence or &s;eal of his commi&s;&s;ion, was the &s;pirit of prophecy, or the power of working miracles. In other nations where God has not vouch&s;afed &s;uch immediate in|terpo&s;ition, the con&s;ent of the governed, is that which gives to any one, a right to empire and au|thority. Thus the choice and approbation of the people comes in the room of the divine appoint|ment, or, in other words, is expre&s;&s;ive of it. This may be the foundation of that very common max|im&mdash;The voice of the people, is the voice of God. Now let it be ob&s;erved, that by this authority, I mean the general voice of a free people, fit per|&s;ons had been cho&s;en and appointed to enact laws, and regulate an empire in America. To this empire we owe obedience, and profe&s;s &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The coun|cil of this empire, the continental Congre&s;s takes the place of Mo&s;es, in the Jewi&s;h legi&s;lature. Tho&s;e, therefore, who attempt to &s;ubvert &s;uch con&s;titution and appointment, and this in order that they them|&s;elves
<PB N="36" REF="015748_0036_0F9A270329F26740">
may have the rule over us, which is the aim of our Briti&s;h enemies, act in the &s;ame line of con|duct, with Core and his a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>It will be evident, if you give me leave to a&s;k&mdash; what lawful ground have they on which to build authority? A divine commi&s;&s;ion they have not, for otherwi&s;e, what prophe&s;y of theirs hath been accompli&s;hed, or what miracle hath been performed by them? Our con&s;ent they cannot plead; for we reject their government, and hate it, as we ought to hate &s;in, which is the bane of human nature, and the poi&s;on of the &s;oul. The claim of the&s;e men is groundle&s;s; yet they have per&s;i&s;ted in the pro|&s;ecution of it with very great ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>On the contrary our conduct with re&s;pect to them, has been that of mildne&s;s and the &s;ofte&s;t moderation. Our congre&s;s, in the manner of the Jewi&s;h legi&s;lature, have rea&s;oned and expo&s;tulated with them. Seemeth it to you a &s;mall thing, gent|lemen, that we have been willing to acknowledge the king of Great-Britain, the arbiter of peace and war, and with the &s;ame authority over us, in other ca&s;es, as is con&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;titution of a free &s;ociety.&mdash;That we have &s;o long &s;ubmitted peaceably to &s;uch re&s;trictions, in the article of com|merce, as throws the balance of our trade &s;o greatly in your favour.&mdash;That we have propo&s;ed to contribute hand&s;omely towards the &s;upport of go|vernment, provided you repeal the inequitable acts of parliament, and give us peace and liberty? Seemeth this to you a &s;mall thing, but &s;eek ye our freedom al&s;o? This was our language to the king of Britain, in our petitions and remon&s;tronces pre|&s;ented to him: When the&s;e had been rejected with di&s;dain, we earne&s;tly de&s;ired to talk the matter over with him, by &s;ome commi&s;&s;ioners appointed for that purpo&s;e. The an&s;wer was, we will not come over.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="015748_0037_0F9A2703EB895ED8">In the cloudy li&s;t of Core's unhappy followers, I mu&s;t place another cla&s;s of men&mdash;The tories. I am not untaught to know, that every tyrant is a tory, and every tory is a tyrant; but I u&s;e the word as in conver&s;ation it is u&s;ed, to &s;ignify tho&s;e a|mong&s;t our&s;elves, who are our enemies. Perhaps it might be well to leave the word entirely to the&s;e, and for the future when we mean to &s;peak both of the Briti&s;h and American pa&s;&s;ive-obedient and non-re&s;i&s;tant loyali&s;ts, to denominate them Corites.</P>
<P>The language of the tory, with relation to the mea&s;ures of their countrymen, and more e&s;pecially the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an independent empire, hath a great re&s;emblance to the language of Core's au|dacious company. Mo&s;es had &s;aid, "Seemeth it to you a &s;mall thing that the God of heaven hath &s;et you up &s;o high already, in the honourable &s;er|vice of the tabernacle, and &s;eek ye the prie&s;t-hood al&s;o? The&s;e were hone&s;t words and intended to recover in their minds, &s;ome &s;en&s;e of gratitude to God, for the honour he had already put upon them; but ob&s;erve with what ungenerous affectation of &s;evere wit and irony, do they, villainou&s;ly make reply. Yes Mo&s;es; there is a piece of conduct ve|ry &s;mall, we readily allow; but apprehend, that if you take a little time to think upon it, you will find it with your&s;elf; not with us. "It is a &s;mall thing, that thou ha&s;t brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wil|derne&s;s, except thou make thy&s;elf altogether a prince over us. Moreover thou ha&s;t not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, and given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Wilt thou put out the eyes of the&s;e men? The &s;train of this language, is the very &s;train and dialect of toryi&s;m. Is it not enough ye patriotic whigs, that you have &s;o gloriou&s;ly deprived us of ea&s;e, quiet,
<PB N="38" REF="015748_0038_0F9A2704A95EE970">
and abundant plenty, which had poured in upon us, in connection with the mother country; but mu&s;t we be obliged to &s;ubmit al&s;o to your tyran|nic government? Moreover, this independency &s;o late &s;et up, hath not &s;uch milk and honey flow|ing with it, as you had made us to conceive. Is it not enough that you have cau&s;ed us, in our man|ner of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, to be unhappy at the pre&s;ent time; but will ye altogether take our life away?</P>
<P>Mo&s;es, who was a very meek man, and much re|&s;embling our general Wa&s;hington, as I conceive it, was very wroth at the words of Core. May not I who am far behind them both, in patience, take the liberty to wax a little wroth, at the language of &s;uch unmanly and provoking tory. What you villain&mdash;do you call that &s;tate which we have quit|ted, a &s;tate of happine&s;s? Do you call &s;ubjection milk, and va&s;&s;alage honey? Do you prefer garlic and cucumbers to manna? Do you ignobly, and un|&s;piritedly chu&s;e the &s;lavery, and dome&s;tic &s;ervi|tude of Britain, before the &s;weets of liberty, even at the pre&s;ent time, without &s;alt? Doth it not en|ter to your mind, that we are yet but in the wil|derne&s;s; and if our quails are not &s;o highly &s;ea|&s;oned, yet we may &s;olace our&s;elves, that we are free, and that by and by, it &s;hall be better with us? Do you not perceive that we are bending brightly to Canaan? Do you not pay attention to the &s;pies who have &s;een the land, and have brought a good account of it? Every one that hath a &s;oul in him, hath &s;een the happine&s;s of a &s;tate of independence, and hath brought a good account of it. Are you the only one that cannot look beyond the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to a more bli&s;sful period? Are you the only one that cannot at any time, amid&s;t our pre&s;ent &s;uffering, with brilliant fancy, and imagination, anticipate
<PB N="39" REF="015748_0039_0F9A2705F57618A0">
tho&s;e ages of renown and plenty when fleets &s;hall vi&s;it us from every coa&s;t of Europe? Are you the only one &s;ingularly blind, that cannot contemplate, and hail your&s;elf in congratulation, to tho&s;e days of &s;weet &s;erenity, and far-extended commerce, when navies from America &s;hall cro&s;s the wide Atlantic and pacific oceans, and bring the &s;ilks of every country, and the fruits of every i&s;land, at fir&s;t mar|ket, to our own &s;hores?</P>
<P>The&s;e days are not far off, though many a to|ry &s;hould not live to &s;ee it. The murmuring of the I&s;raelites, was death to many of them; and it were matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, if &s;peedy execution did not overtake the con&s;tantly-complaining tory of America, and cut him off from tho&s;e the nobler Calebs of our day, who &s;teadily pur&s;ue the land in view, and &s;o &s;hall be admitted to it. I &s;hall not give any farther vent to my re&s;entment, or take up longer time, in expo&s;tulation, with the tory; but go on to &s;ay what ground we have to hope, that as the tory and the tyrant&mdash;under one name the Corite, hath ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in his gain&s;ay|ing; &s;o he &s;hall likewi&s;e peri&s;h in it. The fate of the tyrant, and the tory, is the &s;ame. Like the &s;nakes in the fabled head of Ti&s;iphone, they are &s;o entwi&s;ted, and entwined together, that one &s;troke &s;hall be de&s;truction to them both. If Britain fails in her attempt upon us, the hope and vain ambi|tion of the tory, is likewi&s;e bla&s;ted with her. That Britain &s;hall be di&s;appointed in her aim to &s;ubjugate the continent, I argue from the following principles.</P>
<P N="1">1. The inju&s;tice of her cau&s;e. I admit it as a truth declared in the word of God, and ju&s;tified by experience; that the wicked does not always, in this life, meet with the retribution due to his ini|quity. There is another &s;tate, in which, as indi|viduals,
<PB N="40" REF="015748_0040_0F9A27062ECE7BA0">
we &s;hall again exi&s;t, and be accountable. But this is not the ca&s;e, with regard to bodies po|litic, of whom it &s;hall no more be heard, as the French, the Spani&s;h, or the Engli&s;h nation. It mu&s;t be therefore in this life, that every people &s;hall be judged, and &s;uffer accordingly, the demerit of that wickedne&s;s, which as a nation they have perpe|trated. Be&s;ides; an individual in &s;ociety, may have redre&s;s by common laws of government; but in a conte&s;t between nations, the appeal is made to God; and his it then becomes, to &s;ettle the a|ward of ju&s;tice. In the pre&s;ent conte&s;t with Great-Britain, the appeal hath been made religiou&s;ly to God. It hath been made to him, with tears, with fa&s;ting, and with &s;upplication. We have therefore ground to hope that he will &s;ignally appear for our deliverance. To this I add,</P>
<P N="2">2. The u&s;ual cour&s;e of providence in ca&s;es of this nature. If we revolve the hi&s;tory of man|kind, we &s;hall &s;carcely meet with any in&s;tance of a young and ri&s;ing empire given up to be de&s;troy|ed, by an old and decayed nation. The rever&s;e is u&s;ually the ca&s;e, in the ri&s;e, and fall of every &s;tate. A young and growing people, with great &s;implicity of life, and manners, are attacked by &s;ome haughty and ambitious neighbour. They &s;uffer much, at fir&s;t, from the inva&s;ion; but at length repel the inroad, and make repri&s;als on the enemy. The A&s;&s;yrian empire ro&s;e by &s;uch de|grees, and flouri&s;hed in the world, till making war upon the Per&s;ian, it was cut to pieces by it. The Per&s;ian empire had likewi&s;e its progre&s;&s;ion, and advance to eminence; but fell at length be|fore the Macedonian, and the &s;tates of Greece, whom in their infancy, it had invaded. The Gre|cian empire fell before the Roman. The Roman had its round of greatne&s;s; and in its turn, gave
<PB N="41" REF="015748_0041_0F9A2706E964D510">
way to a number of the &s;maller, and &s;urrounding nations, to whom, it had been many years a terror.</P>
<P>I might &s;hew a &s;imilar cour&s;e, and revolution, in the empire of the Saracens, which hath been overthrown by that of Turcoman. I might &s;hew it to be the circle, in the &s;maller &s;tates of Europe, &s;ince the age of Charlemagne. The fate of Bur|gundy is a &s;triking and particular in&s;tance. This dukedom, which was once &s;o opulent, and power|ful, hath become, by an unju&s;t attack upon the Switzers, &s;o ruined and entirely bankrupt, that we hear no longer of it, but as a province of the French monarchy. Such hath been the cour&s;e of provi|dence in bringing forth, and putting down the empires of the world. Who then can rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e it probable, that North-America, a young and ri&s;ing people, is &s;o near her exit as to wealth and happine&s;s, while Britain that hath already lived a life of empire, &s;hould &s;till &s;urvive and be immor|tal? That it cannot be, I argue,</P>
<P N="3">3. The great unnatural impropriety, that &s;tates already pa&s;t the age of infancy, and va&s;tly larger in extent of territory, &s;hould &s;till depend upon a realm, which once they called their own, and be directed by her. If we ca&s;t our eye upon the works of God around us, we &s;hall ob&s;erve a cer|tain fitne&s;s and proportion illu&s;trative of that which equally hath a place in all the ways of providence, in the direction of the affairs of men. What &s;atellite is larger than its planet? What branch of any tree is larger than the tree? Or is there any bird that doth not leave her youg when they are taught to fly as &s;wiftly as her&s;elf? It is not natural that &s;tates, with &s;uch extent of territory, and which in a few years, at the u&s;ual rate of population, mu&s;t be &s;u|perior to Great-Britain in the number of inhabi|tants, &s;hould &s;till continue &s;ubject to an i&s;land,
<PB N="42" REF="015748_0042_0F9A2707AA154120">
which in the map of the world is but a &s;pot, &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed in the Geography. It is not natural, that &s;tates, in full maturity of growth compared with infancy, &s;hould &s;till continue in &s;ub|jection to an empire, whom, &s;ome two hundred years ago, they called their parent. That it can|not be, I mention,</P>
<P N="4">4. The great improbability, in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of things, that Britain &s;hould be able to reduce us. It would be a miracle in the common rea&s;on, and nature of events, if a country, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, and of no greater compa&s;s than Great Britain, could &s;end a body of troops, able to cope with and &s;ubdue the &s;tanding army, and militia of this continent. It is true, we read in hi&s;tory, of very powerful kingdoms &s;ubdued by a band of robbers, that came upon them like an inundation; but we mu&s;t take notice of a circum&s;tance in our ca&s;e com|pleaty different. The&s;e men were not only more warlike than the people whom they had invaded; but they had migrated from their own country, with the whole &s;trength and numbers of their nation. This was the conduct of the Normans who &s;ubdued England. Now unle&s;s the tyrant of Great-Britain, &s;hould in like manner evacuate his own territory, and find &s;hips to carry him, three thou|&s;and miles, with his eight or ten millions, acro&s;s the ocean, he could not hope to effectuate his pur|po&s;e. Nay he mu&s;t find ve&s;&s;els to tran&s;port them all at the &s;ame time; otherwi&s;e the fir&s;t freight would be wa&s;ted and de&s;troyed, before he could bring the re&s;t to reinforce them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides in the ca&s;e of antient, or of more mo|dern conquerors of kingdoms, it is to be ob&s;erved; that the nation, overpowered by them, had been divided and at variance among&s;t them&s;elves; &s;o that they could not bring their whole &s;trength to act again&s;t the tyrant who invaded them. The ty|rant
<PB N="43" REF="015748_0043_0F9A2708697BFEC0">
on the other hand, by taking part with one or the other of the parties, and making u&s;e of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, at length obtained an ea&s;y conque&s;t over both. This was the ca&s;e in the Ea&s;t-India &s;ettle|ments, where the natives effeminate, unwarlike, undi&s;ciplined, and what is more, at variance a|mong&s;t them&s;elves, became an ea&s;y prey to the ra|pacious Engli&s;hman. Not &s;o the &s;tates of North-America, which are harmoniou&s;ly confederated, and &s;hall &s;tand or fall together. To this may be added,</P>
<P N="5">5. The growing &s;trength and power of full re|&s;i&s;tance from America. The heroes that we loo&s;e in battle, are every day replaced, in thrice the num|ber, by young and ri&s;ing &s;oldiers, that come &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively to manhood. Our numbers, after all our battles, are now undoubtedly &s;uperior to what we reckoned at the beginning of the conte&s;t. We have at a moderate computation, thirty thou&s;and in their &s;eventeenth year, at this particular time, upon the continent, that &s;hall the next campaign be fit for action. The &s;laughter mu&s;t be great in|deed, if the whole, or even half of them, the next campaign &s;hall fall in battle. Yet if one half &s;hould fall, a new recruit, the following year, of more than thirty thou&s;and, &s;hall add them&s;elves, to tho&s;e remaining; and thus, our numbers, which encrea&s;e continually, &s;hall make our oppo&s;ition cer|tain, and at la&s;t victorious.</P>
<P>The &s;trength of our re&s;i&s;tance is encrea&s;ed far|ther, in the love of military duty, and improved &s;kill in mea&s;ures of defence again&s;t the foe, or in attack upon them. The pre&s;ent war was not by any means a thing of choice. We engaged in it with reluctance. We were dragged to it. Nothing but the &s;trong law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, could have per&s;uaded men to leave the quiet &s;cenes of agricul|ture, for the noi&s;e and danger of the camp. No|thing but the dire nece&s;&s;ity of a re&s;i&s;tance, could
<PB N="44" REF="015748_0044_0F9A27092ACF8C88">
have made them willing to exchange the plow, and pruning hook, for the mu&s;ket and the &s;word. We were without the love, and without the &s;kill of war.</P>
<P>In the love of war we are &s;ufficiently advanced. It is happy, &s;ince we mu&s;t fight the tyrant, that we love to fight him. Our &s;oldiers are enamoured of marches, and what by others may be called fatigue. They pant ardently for con&s;tant and &s;evere encounter with the enemy. The complaint with us, by and by, &s;hall be, what it was with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, in the la&s;t war in Europe. It was not that he wanted &s;oldiers, but that he want|ed farmers; for all ranks and cla&s;&s;es, of his peo|ple were &s;o &s;mitten with a love of military life, and enterprize, that there were not &s;ufficient left at home to cultivate the ground.</P>
<P>In the &s;kill of war we have greatly and rapidly improved. I do not think I &s;hall be chargeable with giving cau&s;e of ju&s;t offence to any public military character, by &s;aying, that we have now &s;ubalterns in our army, more capable of office and command, than many of our generals at the commencement of this debate. What in&s;tances of genius, and what &s;pecimens of military &s;cience, may we not expect in future actions? I am per&s;uaded, that if the war continues but a few years longer, America &s;hall be the &s;chool of valour and experi|ence; and voluntiers of highe&s;t rank and fortune, &s;hall flock from every court and &s;tate of Europe, as many have already done, to &s;erve among&s;t us. The&s;e arguments are nervous; and I brace them with another quite as good, which is,</P>
<P N="6">6. The growing hatred and re&s;entment, every day conceived again&s;t the tyrant. The name of Engli&s;hmen will &s;hortly be as much abhorred by us, as was that of the Genoe&s;e among the Cor&s;icans, when, according to the account of Bo&s;well, mothers &s;tilled with this, the children on the brea&s;t, and
<PB N="45" REF="015748_0045_0F9A2709EB67A608">
&s;aid proverbially, there comes a Genoe&s;e. I will give you to the Genoe&s;e. This circum&s;tance, is as a wall of iron, to their inroad. Men will do much before they yield obedience to tho&s;e whom they hate extremely. More violent pre&s;&s;ure, &s;hould the tyrant be in a capacity to bring it on us, will give ri&s;e to more violent exertion: And &s;hould it come to a deci&s;ive point, upon the very border of defeat and &s;ubjugation; the &s;pirit of re&s;entment kin|dled in us, would naturally produce &s;uch efforts of de&s;pair, as could not be re&s;i&s;ted by him. I clo&s;e the&s;e arguments with one, which may be taken a po&s;teriore, as the Schools would &s;ay, that is,</P>
<P N="7">7. From a &s;urvey of the face of mea&s;ures which have had place, on either &s;ide, in this illu&s;trious conte&s;t. A good Phy&s;ician, well acquainted with the &s;y&s;tem of the human body, can tell the &s;ymp|toms of di&s;order, or the &s;tate of health, by feeling gently on the pul&s;e of any patient; but every one can judge with &s;ome degree of certainty, by look|ing on the countenance, and there examining the bloom, or palene&s;s of complexion, as &s;igns of health, or &s;ickne&s;s. Ju&s;t &s;o it is exceeding obvious, and to be read as written very legibly in the conduct of the tyrant, that he &s;hall be un&s;ucce&s;sful; and, at the &s;ame time, in characters as plain, in that of the Americans, that they are to be victorious. The tyrant has made u&s;e of every wicked art to bring about his purpo&s;e. Con&s;cious of his weakne&s;s, of him&s;elf, to cope with us, he has invited &s;laves, and &s;avages, to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In the per&s;on of the Ge|neral who fir&s;t &s;u&s;tained our oppo&s;ition, he is chargeable with di&s;ingenuity, and breach of pro|mi&s;e, relative to the blockade of Bo&s;ton. In the per&s;on of him, at the head of the campaign, again&s;t us; he has been guilty of a mean re&s;erve, in &s;et|ling the cartel, for the exchange of pri&s;oners. He has treated with inhunanity, the pri&s;oners fallen
<PB N="46" REF="015748_0046_0F9A270AAB6D3000">
into his hands, He has mangled the wounded, and refu&s;ed quarter on the field of battle. He has acted ba&s;ely, in &s;o many ca&s;es, that men hereafter reading the tran&s;actions of this period, &s;hall na|turally exclaim, before they hear the con&s;equence&mdash; this man does not de&s;erve to be &s;ucce&s;sful. On the other hand, the conduct of the Americans, has been &s;o fair, &s;o gentlemanly, that it is to me a pre&s;age of the happine&s;s intended for them; and men in future ages reading their behaviour in this illu&s;tri|ous conte&s;t, when they &s;hall hear the truth in pro|mi&s;es, the candour in negotiation, the fortitude in &s;uffering, and di&s;a&s;trous ca&s;es; the valour, and he|roic ardour in the day of battle; and to ca&s;t a glory on the re&s;t, the treatment of the wounded, and the pri&s;oners, they mu&s;t declare, before they come to the re&s;ult, and clo&s;e of it; the&s;e men de|&s;erve to be victorious. And why de&s;erve to be victorious; but that God hath given them hone&s;ty, and in the truth, and wi&s;dom of their mea&s;ures, hath laid the foundation of that policy, and em|pire, which he is about to e&s;tabli&s;h on this conti|nent. You will ob&s;erve in nature, and in every u&s;eful work of art, a certain corre&s;pondency be|tween the parts, &s;o that the cau&s;e &s;hall have a like|ne&s;s to the effect, and from the ground work of a building, you may gue&s;s the &s;uper&s;tructue. Thus from the earlier parts of any enterprize, may be obtained, &s;ome di&s;tant apprehen&s;ion of that event which is to be the con&s;equence. The confederacy of the&s;e united &s;tates has been &s;o &s;in|gular&mdash;The wi&s;dom of their mea&s;ures &s;o remark|able, as gives a proper bottom to a mighty empire. But on the contrary, the tyrant has been deceived in every information. He has acted mo&s;t impolitic in many ca&s;es. His wi&s;dom has been turned to fooli&s;hne&s;s. His councils have been &s;o broken, &s;o jarring, and disjointed, that it &s;eems to be of God,
<PB N="47" REF="015748_0047_0F9A270B69FA5A68">
to baffle his unrighteous undertaking. To this purpo&s;e is the &s;entence&mdash;<HI>whom God means to ruin, he fir&s;t &s;trikes with madne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I come to clo&s;e the &s;ubject, by ob&s;erving; that as Great-Britain &s;hall be di&s;appointed in her mea&s;ures; tho&s;e unhappy things in human &s;hape, denominated tories, are of all men mo&s;t mi&s;erable. They cannot hope to ta&s;te that happine&s;s, which they have &s;o &s;anguinely expected. They mu&s;t give up the build|ings in the city, and the plea&s;ant &s;eats upon the ri|ver bank, which fancy had &s;o generou&s;ly laid out for them. They mu&s;t forego their native country, which they have de&s;erted and &s;o ba&s;ely labour|ed to de&s;troy. That the King of England &s;hall &s;end for them, and reward their villainy, with royal bounty and munificence is not &s;o very clear; but it is mo&s;t certain that they &s;hall be &s;ent to make a tryal, and wait upon him for it. There &s;hall they wander and walk about with other hungry depen|dents, and &s;hadows con&s;equent on the&s;e, until he &s;hall graciou&s;ly be plea&s;ed to take notice of them. They &s;hall wait long and at la&s;t be di&s;appointed; for I venture to affirm, that the king of England apprehends that they have already, had a &s;ufficient recompence, in the very honour of having &s;erved him. It is the nature of a wicked man, who is, or thinks him&s;elf &s;uperior, to believe that men his fellow creatures, have been born for his amu&s;e|ment. This, I am per&s;uaded, is the &s;entiment of every tyrant, and particularly of the Maje&s;ty of Britain, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e unhappy beings, who &s;ub&s;erve him in his dirty work, now carrying on in America. The u&s;e of power is intoxicating; and the very &s;ervitude that is offered to a ba&s;e prince, will cau&s;e him to expect the continuance of &s;ubjec|tion. At fir&s;t he will look upon attachment as a favour. At length he will expect it as a duty&mdash;a duty not to be recompenced in any other way, than
<PB N="48" REF="015748_0048_0F9A270C2A3FF2D0">
in the plea&s;ure, and mighty honour which he &s;up|po&s;es them to have had, in performing it. For this rea&s;on, the&s;e men who labour, by a mighty kind of faith, for the un&s;een realities of George's favour, are not about to find any certain &s;ub&s;tance, to an&s;wer the deluded expectation. Verily I &s;ay unto you tories, you &s;hall lo&s;e your reward. You may go home to England, and have a gracious &s;ight of his Maje&s;ty's royal countenance, but this will &s;carcely &s;lake your appetite, or, unle&s;s you have clothes upon your back, keep your bodies warm. You may go to England, and walk about as pil|grims on the earth, but you &s;hall be buffeted by &s;atan, and contemned by every cla&s;s of men. You may go home to England, and walk about as pil|grims on the earth, while you live; but when you die, I am for having it written on your tombs,</P>

<HEAD>THE AGENCY OF HEAVEN, IN THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>And there was war in heaven.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Rev. xii, 7.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words have not a reference to the war imagined to be in heaven, when the devil fir&s;t &s;inned and fell from the light above&mdash;ima|gined, I &s;ay, becau&s;e we cannot tell whether God permitted him to levy war, for a while, in a du|bious conte&s;t, with the holy angels; or whether he hurled him at once, by his own almighty power, to the lake of hell. Nor have the&s;e words a reference to any war waged &s;ince in the higher world; for heaven is a place of love; and as no contention, or ho&s;tile debate, can ari&s;e among&s;t the inhabitants now confirmed and &s;ecure in bli&s;s; &s;o no kind of violence can have entrance to it, from any other quarter. The meaning therefore is not that angel combated with angel, on the plain of heaven; but that heaven was engaged in a war.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="015748_0050_0F9A270E4FBDDC88">The devil is con&s;tantly exciting &s;ome tyrannic mon&s;ter, to make war upon the world, and take away the rights and priviledges of &s;ociety. God is ever ready to re&s;i&s;t him; and this, in the common mea&s;ures of his providence; or by the agency of ho|ly and cele&s;tial &s;pirits, that execute his orders.</P>
<P>From this it follows, that at any time, when a war is commenced again&s;t the cau&s;e of truth upon the earth, there is likewi&s;e a war in heaven, or hea|ven is engaged in a war. In this &s;en&s;e it is &s;aid, in the words con&s;equent on tho&s;e I have cho&s;en, "Michael and his angels fought again&s;t the dra|gon; and the dragon fought, and his angels."</P>
<P>I &s;hall not undertake to &s;ay, who was the tyrant, whom Saint John principally intended. It may have been a certain of the Roman Cae&s;ars; Nero, or Caligula, or Domitian. The&s;e were &s;tirred up by the devil, to begin a war upon the earth, a|gain&s;t the rights and privileges of the church of God. The&s;e came all to an untimely end, and evi|denced by their fate, that providence beheld their villainy, and fought again&s;t them.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible Saint John may have had his eye, upon a later period. The pre&s;ent time and the George of England may be that which is pointed out in this place of &s;cripture. Be this as it will, the con&s;truction is applicable to the tyrant; for wicked men every where are the &s;oldiery of &s;atan. They &s;upport the cau&s;e, and range them&s;elves be|neath the &s;tandard of the devil; but the troops of God are embodied, and war in heaven, is levied to oppo&s;e them. I &s;hall &s;o apply it at the pre&s;ent time, and &s;hew,</P>
<P N="1">I. That in our conte&s;t with the tyrant, hell hath been again&s;t us.</P>
<P N="2">II. That heaven hath taken an active part, and waged war for us.</P>
<P N="1">1. In our conte&s;t with the tyrant hell hath been again&s;t us. It is evident,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="51" REF="015748_0051_0F9A270E696C9188">1. From the nature of the cau&s;e, the &s;ucce&s;s of which mu&s;t be agreeable to &s;atan. What would the arch fiend wi&s;h more, than to behold de&s;poti&s;m in America? What would he wi&s;h more than to be|hold one man with &s;uch rule, and authority, that with a word, he could take away the life of the brave&s;t &s;ubject&mdash;That without a jury of his peers, he could &s;entence him to death, and &s;hed his blood upon the &s;caffold&mdash;That without re&s;traint of law, he could take away the property of any, and &s;pend it on his favourites, and debauchees, &s;ent out from home, to rule, with arbitrary &s;way, upon the conti|nent. What would he wi&s;h more than to behold, in con&s;equence of this, the labour of the hu&s;band|man checked, in the annual tillage of the ground&mdash; the country wa&s;te&mdash;every plain de&s;olate? For who could have heart to cultivate the ground, or build a man&s;ion hou&s;e to hold it, only at the precarious plea&s;ure of &s;ome Ba&s;haw, or vice-roy of the tyrant? How laughable would it be to the grim prince of darkne&s;s, to behold &s;cience, which hath bloomed &s;o &s;weetly in the&s;e infant &s;tates, to langui&s;h and de|cay! This I aver to be the con&s;equent on tyranny.</P>
<P>Tyranny is de&s;tructive to religion al&s;o. The &s;ove|reign in his ab&s;olute, and unre&s;i&s;ted empire, may forbid this or that denomination, to wor&s;hip God, according to the dictates of their con&s;ciences. Good and upright men may &s;truggle hard again&s;t it&mdash;may &s;eal the truth with blood; but the greater part &s;hall &s;hroud them&s;elves, in the religion of the &s;tate, becau&s;e of the offices, and honours which at|tend it. The con&s;equence is &s;piritual death, and the face of mi&s;ery every where. Ignorance, and &s;uper&s;tition follow de&s;poti&s;m. Satan is old enough, and &s;ufficiently &s;agacious, to attend to this. He &s;ees it every day, in India, in Turky, and in &s;ome parts of Europe; and as he traver&s;es the globe, he wi&s;hes to behold it in America. Can we then doubt
<PB N="52" REF="015748_0052_0F9A270F294AC918">
but that in our conte&s;t with the tyrant he is, heart and hand, again&s;t us? It is evident from the nature of the cau&s;e, and</P>
<P N="2">2. From the manner in which the tyrant hath endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h it. He hath made u&s;e of fraud in negotiation with us. He hath brought a mercenary army, from the heart of Europe, to de|&s;troy us. He hath excited Indian &s;avages, to murder us in cold blood. He hath made war, with a re|mor&s;ele&s;s rage; refu&s;ing quarter, on the field of battle. He hath fami&s;hed our pri&s;oners, in his goals; or &s;entenced them to other climes, at a di&s;|tance from the light of God's revealed truth. He hath burned towns. He hath wa&s;ted &s;ettlements. He hath in&s;iduou&s;ly offered terms of peace, with a view to effect by artifice, what he could not do, by open force, and fair ho&s;tility. When we con&s;ider the&s;e things, can we doubt; but that as the cau&s;e hath been fabricated in the &s;hop of &s;atan; &s;o it hath been carried on, in a manner agreeable to his &s;ug|ge&s;tions? Can we doubt, but that &s;atan hath been bu&s;y with our enemies? He hath, undoubtedly, been bu&s;y. He hath been pre&s;ent at the council board. He hath been an aid upon the field of bat|tle. He hath brought many evil &s;pirits to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. The troops of hell hath been again&s;t us.</P>
<P N="2">II. Heaven hath taken an active part, and waged war for us. It is con&s;picuous,</P>
<P N="1">1. From our union which was &s;o early, and &s;o univer&s;al. God only, who has the hearts of all men in his hand, could have brought about &s;uch con&s;ent and full agreement in the cau&s;e, among&s;t a people of different origin, and occupations, and cu&s;toms, and manners, and religion. The de&s;cendants of the Scot, the Iri&s;h, the Engli&s;h and the German, have all embarked on the &s;ame bottom. The la|bourer, the hu&s;bandman, the merchant, the me|chanic, have under&s;tood and equally re&s;ented the
<PB N="53" REF="015748_0053_0F9A270FE95D4778">
mea&s;ures of Great-Britain. The pre&s;byterian, the independant, the anabapti&s;t, and the churchman, have made the cau&s;e common. The inhabitant of cold New-Hamp&s;hire, and of burning Georgia, felt alike the patriotic &s;pirit. The polite Virginian, and &s;everer morali&s;t of Penn&s;ylvania, were equally the &s;ubjects of this noble pa&s;&s;ion. The obedience paid to the re&s;olves of congre&s;s by every one of the&s;e, was &s;o regular, and &s;o &s;teady, as to excite the wonder of our enemies. What prince, or any legi&s;lator in the world, has ever found an equal pliancy, in the minds of &s;ubjects, to his laws, as was di&s;covered in the attention of this people, to the committees, and conventions of their re&s;pective colonies? The hand of God is vi&s;ible in this &s;o &s;in|gular a circum&s;tance. It is equally apparent,</P>
<P N="2">2. In the wi&s;dom of our councils. A more ve|nerable body of men never &s;at upon the earth than the fir&s;t congre&s;s. Their writings were truly wor|thy of &s;o great a cau&s;e. If any man feels him&s;elf to flag in his patriotic principles, let him take up the letters, and remon&s;trances &s;ent to Britain&mdash;let him read the addre&s;s to Canada&mdash;to Ireland&mdash;to the Americans, and the declaration, and appeal to foreign powers; and I defy him, if he has the lea&s;t &s;park of virtue in his brea&s;t, not to feel a noble, a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s, and almo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardour for his country. The &s;pirit of God, which taught the workmen at the building of the temple, and gave them uncommon &s;kill, was pre&s;ent with the&s;e men. The &s;pirit of God, which brightly kindles, the clear &s;park of genius in the &s;oul, and gives a fine degree of under&s;tanding, doubtle&s;s, aided them in the&s;e productions. The ble&s;&s;ed God directed them to prudent words, and to wi&s;e and u&s;eful mea|&s;ures. Heaven hath taken an active part in our behalf; and this illu&s;triou&s;ly appears,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="54" REF="015748_0054_0F9A2710AB7073F0">3. From the great, and almo&s;t unhoped for &s;uc|ce&s;s with which our cau&s;e has been attended. We took up arms with trembling apprehen&s;ions of the mighty difficulties we were obliged to encounter. We &s;aw behind us &s;lavery, and before us, the mo&s;t trying &s;cenes of fortitude&punc; and &s;uffering. As every virtuous and generous mind would do, we fled from &s;lavery, though we know not, but the con&s;e|quences was death. We had not arms&mdash;we had not amunition&mdash;we had not many officers of good ex|perience&mdash;we had not &s;oldiers trained and di&s;ci|plined for battle&mdash;we had not any thing, but the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, and the goodne&s;s of almighty providence, to &s;upport our &s;inking &s;pirits. Glory to God, who hath befriended us&mdash;hath given us arms, and ammunition, and many officers of good experience, and &s;oldiers trained and di&s;ci|plined, for battle&mdash;hath made our arms &s;ucce&s;sful&mdash; illu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ucce&s;sful in many places.</P>
<P>Heaven hath made our cau&s;e her own, and this appears.</P>
<P N="4">4. From the manner of our &s;ucce&s;s in general, and deliverance in &s;ome particular ca&s;es. At the commencement of the war, our greate&s;t fears ori|ginated, from the navy of Great-Britain. We did not entertain the lea&s;t idea of &s;aving the &s;malle&s;t boat or ve&s;&s;el, from her depredation. We appre|hended her &s;o fully the mi&s;tre&s;s of the ocean, that not one bay or creek, or inlet could be found, which was not under her in&s;pection; yet we &s;ee, our merchantmen have brought, from every port of Europe, a great &s;upply of what we wanted. Our privateers have &s;coured the ocean, and in the very channel, on the coa&s;t of England, have captured &s;uch prizes as more than makes amends for all the lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;tained. Our &s;hips of force, of which we had not one at the beginning, have brave|ly fought the tyrant; and often proved victorious.
<PB N="55" REF="015748_0055_0F9A27116B674078">
This is a noble and exhau&s;tle&s;s fund of evidence that God him&s;elf hath been our Admiral.</P>
<P>In our operations on the continent, we had ex|pected little from the militia &s;oldiery; yet the&s;e have had a &s;hare not incon&s;iderable in &s;ome the mo&s;t important actions. The militia fought at Lexington, they fought at Bunker-hill engagement. The&s;e little victories were kindly granted them, by providence, as nece&s;&s;ary at the fir&s;t, to lift their hope, and &s;atisfy the mind of every one, that Americans were not irre&s;olute, and Britons, however veteran in experience, were not invul|nerable. The militia fought in Carolina, and quelled the Tory in&s;urrection. They fought in the Virginia &s;tate. They fought in Jer&s;ey. They fought with Harkemer. They fought with Stark. They fought with the illu&s;trious Gates. They acted nobly in every battle, and encounter, from the we&s;tward of the Hud&s;on, to the heights of Sara|toga.</P>
<P>Nor le&s;s remarkable was our deliverance, in &s;ome particular ca&s;es. A gracious providence hath not permitted us to be &s;ucce&s;sful in any one parti|cular place, more than was con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety, and general intere&s;t of our whole exertions. We made the greate&s;t &s;laughter, but lo&s;t the ground at Bunker-Hill engagement, and this becau&s;e it did not &s;uit us to retain it. Had we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the heights, the Briti&s;h mu&s;t have left the city of Bo&s;|ton, and &s;ailed for New-York or Philadelphia, where we had not been &s;o well prepared to receive them; but flatterd vainly with the &s;mall advantage of the ground, they &s;till continued to attempt this province. The &s;ummer and &s;ucceeding winter was, in con&s;equence of this, exhau&s;ted fruitle&s;sly; and before they could approach us to the we&s;tward, we al&s;o were in readine&s;s to bid them welcome.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="015748_0056_0F9A27122A9BD258">Our cau&s;e was at the lowe&s;t ebb, when Howe had travelled through the Jer&s;ies, and appeared upon the Delaware; yet even then, we ro&s;e upon the wings of conque&s;t; and from an almo&s;t hopele&s;s &s;ituation, became the talk and panegiric of the world. Our foe them&s;elves could not but own the merit of our general, tho&s;e of them e&s;pecially, who had the &s;oul to under&s;tand what prai&s;e was due to patience, fortitude, and &s;kill and valour in the brea&s;t of heroes.</P>
<P>Our ca&s;e was gloomy, when Burgoine had pa&s;&s;ed Ticonderoga, and penetrated deeply through the northern provinces. In this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed quarter we had expected nothing but defeat and deva&s;tation. Our eye of hope was fixed chiefly on the &s;ucce&s;s of the campaign in Penn&s;ylvania. But on the contrary our principal &s;ucce&s;s has been obtained again&s;t the nor|thern forces of the tyrant. In this department we have been remarkably victorious; and it would &s;eem that God permitted the rude foe to come thus far, in order that at length his gracious providence might have an ampler field of triumph, in deliver|ing him to ignominy and defeat among&s;t us.</P>
<P>With this I mention what at fir&s;t may &s;eem unhap|pine&s;s; that is the inroad of the foe through Penn|&s;ylvania and the Jer&s;ies. But is it not compleatly evident, that thus it was the will of God to make us ta&s;te &s;o much of gall and wormwood, in the cup of tyranny pre&s;ented to us, that afterwards we &s;hould not ea&s;ily forget it; or even half-way tories, be tempted to de&s;ire a &s;econd draught of &s;uch ma|lignant poi&s;on?</P>
<P>Thus in the manner of our &s;ucce&s;s in general, and deliverance in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, the hand of God is vi&s;ible. We have &s;ucceeded where we had not hope to &s;ucceed. We have been delivered when we looked not for deliverance. Our aid hath come from whence we had not much expected it. We have
<PB N="57" REF="015748_0057_0F9A2712EB604368">
been favoured in a manner, and on occa&s;ions truly &s;ingular. Are we not then &s;en&s;ible that heaven is active for us? I argue la&s;tly,</P>
<P>The company of good and pious men, who have mo&s;t eminently &s;truggled with us. Take a view of tho&s;e among&s;t our&s;elves, who are again&s;t us, and count the debauchees, and rakes, and co|vetous, and de&s;igning, and &s;elf-intere&s;ted men, and you will find them to compo&s;e a greater part of that collection. On the other hand, &s;et down the hone&s;t, the &s;en&s;ible, and &s;erious of your neigh|bours, and extend your computation, to the good and virtuous of the country round you; and how few, if any of the&s;e, will you will find again&s;t our mea&s;ures? nay are not the mo&s;t religious, and mo&s;t pious per&s;ons, the warme&s;t advocates for op|po&s;ition and re&s;i&s;tance? How many &s;weet and holy prayers, are every day put up, by good and worthy men of all denominations? Our company in this debate is heavenly; and heaven I am per&s;uaded, doth patronize, and will finally &s;ucceed it.</P>
<P>Heaven knows nothing of neutrality. The &s;ound of &s;uch indifferance, was never heard in heaven. Every angel, every &s;eraph feels in our behalf. They know not the &s;ecret will of God, and &s;o are anxi|ous for the great event. Doubtle&s;s it is plea&s;ing to any one of the&s;e, when he is ordered to take his flight to earth, and there direct the cour&s;e of &s;uch a victory, in favour of the brave American. For providence is but the agency of God, either by his own interpo&s;ition, or by the mini&s;try of powers, and principalities, that &s;tand before him. Angels are his mini&s;tring &s;pirits, and they delight to execute his orders among&s;t men, or through the bounds of the un&s;een creation. Much &s;weet a&s;&s;i&s;tance have we had from the&s;e &s;ince the beginning of the con|te&s;t. There is not one tory, to be found among&s;t the order of the &s;eraphim. There is not one cold

phlegmatic &s;pirit, that can bear to be a neutral. Heaven is active for us, and her inhabitants, through all their &s;hining ranks and orders.</P>
<P>Let me now improve the &s;ubject,</P>
<P N="1">1. You &s;ee from hence, that we are to give God the glory. The arm of fle&s;h is weak, and in it&s;elf contemptible. It is God that &s;teels the heart, and gives a re&s;olution to engage in trials. It is God that crowns our efforts with &s;ucce&s;s. Let the cau&s;e in which we are engaged prai&s;e God. Let the councils by which it hath been pleaded prai&s;e God. Let the patriots he hath rai&s;ed to &s;upport it, prai&s;e God. Let the &s;ucce&s;s which hath attended it, prai&s;e God. Let the day of Lexington and the dawn of our renown, prai&s;e him. Let the death of War|ren and the Bunker-Hill engagement, prai&s;e him. Let our approach through Canada, and the death of a Montgomery, prai&s;e him. It was God who rai&s;ed the&s;e gallant men, and filled their bo&s;oms with the &s;acred glow of freedom. It was God who bade them die, and give them immortal to their country.</P>
<P>Think, my brethren on Fort Sullivan, and lift your &s;ouls to God. Think on the Carolina&mdash;and the Virginia victories. Think on the thou&s;and that we &s;tormed at Trenton. Think on victorious Princetown, and be a&s;hamed of your ingratitude. Think on the Brun&s;wick Ambu&s;cades. Think on the &s;ouls who fought at Brandywine. Think on the well-conducted charge at Germantown. Think on Fort Mercer, and the &s;hore of Delaware. Think on Fort-Miflin &s;o gallantly defended. Think, O think, on the&s;e my countrymen, and let your hearts be warmed with a holy fervour.</P>
<P>Think on the noble death of Harkemer. Think on victorious Stark, and the &s;ucce&s;s at Bennington. Think on illu&s;trious Warner, who &s;hared with him in the glory. Think on the garri&s;on at Fort Montgomery&mdash;a fort retained and quitted with im|mortal

honour. Think on the field&mdash;the field of Stillwater. Think on the heights&mdash;the fair capitu|lated heights of Saratoga. Think on Burgoyne. Think on his proclamation&mdash;what &s;ound, what tri|umph&mdash;what defeat, what ignominy. 'Tis God that rai&s;es up the humble, but lays the lofty low before him. Let every pul&s;e that beats throughout our veins, let every breath that draws the air this day, be &s;acred to his glory. He is God, and there is not another. He is great, and there is none be|&s;ides him.</P>
<P>From the &s;ubject, and the thoughts &s;ugge&s;ted on it you have</P>
<P N="2">2. Foundation of encouragement. Our cau&s;e is yet upon the balance. Our &s;words are yet un|&s;heathed. Our hands are &s;till upon the hilts of them. Much hath been done. Much yet remains to do. Be not di&s;mayed. Remember your &s;upport. Hath France declared war; or is it out of doubt, that Spain hath taken an active part in our behalf? Of this, I am not certain, nor &s;trictly able to in|form you; but this I &s;ay, that God is for us, and heaven hath taken an active part. The court of heaven hath long determined it, nor was there one di&s;&s;enting voice among them. Michael &s;ays 'tis war, and younger angels &s;ay, 'tis war&mdash;with Bri|tain.</P>
<P>Are the officers of France called home, to take their places in her armies? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The above di&s;cour&s;e was drawn up and delivered on thn</HI> 18<HI>th of December,</HI> 1777, <HI>in Queen-Ann's county, Maryland; at which time there was a report that France had declared war, and that in con&s;equence of this, her officers who &s;erve in America were ordered home to take the command of their re&s;pective regiments and divi&s;ions.</HI></NOTE> 'Tis &s;aid they are; but what is that to us, my countrymen.

but &s;till inferior to the bright and the &s;hining cap|tains of the ho&s;t of heaven. The officers of France have &s;een the wars in Germany, in Poland, and in Ru&s;&s;ia. The captains of the ho&s;t of God have &s;een the war, and combat with the dragon&mdash;have &s;een the wars before the flood, and &s;ince in every age and country. The&s;e have come down to help us, and the&s;e &s;hall be continued with us. Had we our eye-&s;ight, we &s;hould &s;ee, that they that be with us, are more than they that be again&s;t us. Had we our eye-&s;ight we &s;hould behold chariots of fire, and winged &s;teeds encompa&s;&s;ing our mountains. We are afraid perhaps that Britain will recruit from the European continent, and &s;end in thou&s;ands to augment her forces. Let us be confident that God is for us, and the armies of the univer&s;e, are not &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t his providence. The &s;ubject,</P>
<P>La&s;tly; &s;ugge&s;ts to us a motive to repentance. It &s;eems to me our cau&s;e &s;hall pro&s;per, and be final|ly &s;ucce&s;sful; yet cloudy days of &s;uffering may be in re&s;erve before us. I do not by any means ex|pect a &s;udden i&s;&s;ue to the conte&s;t. Before it is concluded, many a mother &s;hall have lo&s;t her &s;on and many a wife her hu&s;band. Let every indivi|dual lay this matter for him&s;elf to heart. If we are delivered from our enemy, yet many wicked per&s;ons, like the unbelieving lord, that that was trodden under foot, at the gate of Samaria, &s;hall not live to &s;ee it. What &s;hall it profit any man, if we gain our liberty, and a&s;&s;ert our indepen|dance, if in the mean time, he &s;hall have lo&s;t the eternal liberty, and freedom of his own &s;oul? What will it profit him, if he e&s;cape the taxation of Great-Britain; but in the mean time, mu&s;t lie down in &s;orrow, and pay the debt, due to God's ju&s;tice in the flame of hell. In time of war, or in time of peace, there is no &s;afety but in Chri&s;t. Ha&s;te therefore, and give no re&s;t to your eyes, nor

<HEAD>THE BLASPHEMY OF GASCONADE AND SELF-DEPENDENCE IN A CERTAIN GENERAL.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>And there was given unto him a mouth, &s;peaking great things and bla&s;phemies.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Rev. xiii, 5.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I DO not mean to enter into the controver&s;y, whether it is the Pope, that originally is inten|ded by the&s;e words, or &s;ome other noble worthy of an equal mouth. I mean to &s;ay, that they are ap|plicable to a certain general, with whom we have tried our &s;words a while; and that is the celebra|ted John Burgoyne E&s;quire, lieutenant-general, in North-America, with many other de&s;ignatory titles, which it were tedious to recapitulate or mention. This general hath &s;poken great things, and bla&s;|phemies.</P>
<P N="1">I. Great things. It is &s;aid that a certain old gentleman, of whom many things are fabled, u&s;u|ally comes upon the earth, e&s;pecially about even|ing-time,
<PB N="63" REF="015748_0063_0F9A27176A011CE0">
in the &s;hape of a common man; but on di&s;covery of his cloven foot, takes departure in a flame of fire. The general, hath no re&s;emblance, in this particular, to &s;atan; for he came among&s;t us in a flame of fire, but went away like a common man.</P>
<P>He made his fir&s;t appearance on the conti|nent, in a &s;ky-rocket, and fire-work de&s;cription of the day of Charles-Town, and the Bunker-hill en|gagement. Pyramids of flame, and the roar of cannon, mu&s;ketry and mortars, &s;ounded and blazed through the paragraphs. I have &s;een poems on the <HI>la&s;t</HI> conflagration that were nothing to it. The heart of every Whig was made to tremble, for certainly a man that thought and &s;poke &s;o loftily, mu&s;t be capable of doing very lofty actions.</P>
<P>We do not hear much more of him, except in his letter to general Lee, until at the opening of the la&s;t campaign, when with about eleven thou|&s;and men, and half a dozen Indian nations, at his heels, he landed from the lakes of Canada.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of an earth-quake is &s;aid to be a co|lumn of conden&s;ed air, pent up in the bowels of the earth, and &s;uddenly rarified by a hill of &s;ulphur, nitre, or hot materials, of &s;ome kind or other, &s;ub|terraneou&s;ly on fire. In this ca&s;e the column ha&s;|tily expands, and not finding an immediate pa&s;|&s;age, opens to it&s;elf a vent, with great noi&s;e and concu&s;&s;ion of the continent. This may &s;erve to il|lu&s;trate the pa&s;&s;ion and behaviour of the general, who had for a long time conceived a mo&s;t fierce indignation again&s;t the inhabitants of North-Ame|rica. His wrath was pent up in his brea&s;t, and &s;trugg|led to expre&s;s it&s;elf. He wanted elbow-room. We need not wonder, therefore, that on meeting with &s;ome &s;mall advantage, like a bed of nitrous par|ticles, to inflame his ire, he bur&s;t forth, all at once, in the &s;ound of a proclamation.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="015748_0064_0F9A2718293AA448">The cu&s;tom of a proclamation from a warrior, is of very antient date. The champion of Gath was the fir&s;t who brought it into practice. We read that he came forth and proclaimed to the ho&s;t of I&s;rael. <HI>Give me a man that we may fight together.</HI> O, I love fighting mightily. Do, turn out &s;ome active, bri&s;k fellow, that we may have a knock at one another.</P>
<P>David, a young militia &s;oldier, that had never been in action, takes him at his word, and comes out again&s;t him. The Phili&s;tine thought it an af|front to be matched with a boy, and tru&s;ting to his great &s;tature, and his long experience in the &s;ervice, di&s;dains the &s;tripling rebel, and <HI>cur&s;ed him by his gods.</HI> As they approached to the combat, the giant opens wide his mighty mouth, in a &s;econd proclamation&mdash;<HI>come to me, and I will give thy fle&s;h unto the fowls of the air, and to the bea&s;ts of the field.</HI></P>
<P>I am of opinion that Goliah, notwith&s;tanding his challenge to the ho&s;t of I&s;rael, was, as all bullies are, a coward at the bottom; and that his great vaunt of words, previous to the conte&s;t, was inten|ded to intimidate, and, if po&s;&s;ible, prevent the young &s;oldier from coming on the ground at all. He could not, con&s;i&s;tent with the reputation of his prowe&s;s, decline the propo&s;ed duel; but it was his hope that he &s;hould be able to prevent it, by high looks, big words, and &s;ome parade at a di&s;tance. <HI>True valour, like true wi&s;dom, talks little.</HI></P>
<P>The proclamation of Burgoyne was not much un|like the proclamation of the &s;on of Gath. O ye &s;aints and rebels of New-England, wherefore are ye come out again&s;t me with pitch-forks, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burgoyne had written a play, called</HI> The blockade of Bo&s;ton, <HI>in which the New-Englandmen were repre|&s;ented as coming out to battle, with pitch-forks, and ru&s;ty, mu&s;kets on their &s;houlders.</HI></NOTE> and with

But if &s;o, leave your prayers, and your fa&s;tings, and come along, that I may &s;calp your heads, and toma-hac your carca&s;es. <HI>I have but to give &s;tretch to the Indian forces under my command and they amount to thou&s;ands.</HI></P>
<P>The one proclamation is very much a copy of the other; yet I am not certain that the Briti&s;h general had this monument of jewi&s;h hi&s;tory in view, be|cau&s;e I am not certain that Burgoyne reads the &s;cripture. There is indeed no nece&s;&s;ity to &s;uppo&s;e that he had it in his view, in order to account for the re&s;emblance; for the &s;ame &s;pirit, however di&s;|tant in place or period, will always beget the &s;ame manner, and produce the &s;ame language.</P>
<P>It is more probable our gallant general, took the idea of &s;triking terror by a proclamation, from the behaviour of Achilles, at the &s;iege of Troy, as it is told us by Homer, in the eighteenth book of his Iliad. The Trojans, with Hector at their head, contending for the body of Patroclus, pre&s;s upon the Greeks to the very limits of their camp. In this critical conjuncture, Achilles is prevailed on by Minerva, to &s;hew him&s;elf at the head of the en|trenchments, and endeavour to &s;top the fury of the Trojans by a proclamation. Accordingly he mounts the parapet, and bawls out very bri&s;kly, &s;o that the ho&s;tile army are &s;hocked by the clamour and driven back from the battle.</P>
<Q><L>Forth march'd the chief, and di&s;tant from the crowd,</L>
<L>High on the rampart rai&s;ed his voice aloud,</L>
<L>So high his brazen voice the hero rear'd,</L>
<L>Ho&s;ts dropped their arms&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>As the Scotch-man &s;aid, when he &s;aw a rope-dancer on the &s;tage, it is a noble thing to be a

&s;cholar. Burgoyne loves poetry, and doubtle&s;s had admired this circum&s;tance in the conduct of the great &s;on of Pelus. He was willing to adopt and put forth in the modern ta&s;te, &s;omething in the &s;ame &s;tile and manner.</P>
<P>A thing of this &s;ort is very pardonable, for we are all u&s;ually one half of what we are, by imita|tion: nay it is commendable, for a &s;tudy to equal, or excel fine models, is placed by the antient cri|tics among&s;t the &s;ources of good writing; and may it not be &s;o likewi&s;e in the &s;ublime of character and conduct? The great Don-Quixotte made him&s;elf &s;till more great, by a con&s;tant and careful peru&s;al of the hi&s;tories of green, black &amp; grey-coloured knights, and by a magnanimous and &s;teady re&s;olution to emulate their warlike glory and atchievements.</P>
<P>Burgoyne is not more a poet than hi&s;torian. Is it not then po&s;&s;ible, that he may have had the ex|ample of the great Pyrrhus in his eye as we have it related by Polibyus? This prince was not le&s;s daring in an enterprize, than crafty in device and &s;tratagem. When he had invaded Italy, and lay with his troops above Tarentum, he thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make tryal of the patrioti&s;m of the Ro|mans, and of their fortitude, before he adventured far into their country. For this purpo&s;e he invites Fabricius, the con&s;ul, to a conference, in &s;ome &s;uch manner, as Lord Howe, on Staten-I&s;land, the other year, invited three members of the continental con|gre&s;s. By &s;mooth &s;peeches without any meaning, and by the offer of a &s;um of money, he endeavours to engage Fabricius, to act incon&s;i&s;tently with the true intere&s;t of the common-wealth. Having failed in the attempt, and finding that Roman patrioti&s;m was not to be corrupted, he next determines an ex|periment upon their fortitude.</P>
<P>He provides an old re&s;ty elephant, and had it placed behind a curtain, ju&s;t by Fabricius, with its
<PB N="67" REF="015748_0067_0F9A271A6952BC40">
probo&s;&s;cis over him, where he &s;at in conver&s;ation. All at once a &s;tout able-bodied &s;erjeant pricks it with the end of his halbert. The bea&s;t &s;uitably alarmed and opening its mouth in a loud proclamation, is exceeding terrible. The animal was &s;trange and unu&s;ual to the Roman; but di&s;covering no &s;ign of fear or perturbation, he &s;at &s;till, and continued his di&s;cour&s;e with this reflection: <HI>Thy bea&s;t, O Pyrr|hus, hath moved me to day as little as thy gold did ye&s;|terday.</HI> The king ob&s;erving &s;uch dignity and &s;trength of &s;oul in this people, gave over his attempt upon their country, and tran&s;ported his troops back to Epirus.</P>
<P>Burgoyne to a certain length hath imitated Pyrr|hus. He had not been able to procure an elephant; for though &s;ome large bones found upon the banks of the Ohio, do indicate that there may have been of this creature in America, yet none are to be found at the pre&s;ent time.&mdash;He had not been able to procure an elephant, to make the tryal in a true cla&s;&s;ic way; but he does what he can do, and thinks it not ami&s;s to make a little noi&s;e him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth he roared very hideou&s;ly. His fir&s;t roar was on Ticonderoga hill, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The proclamation was given at Ticonderoga.</HI></NOTE> &s;tamping with his foot, and the &s;econd roar was on the margin of Lake-George, about ten miles nearer to us. His roaring waxed loud, and &s;hrill, and terrible. As he came down through the woods of Skeen&s;borough, it was audible to a very great di&s;tance. It was his intention to roar on to Albany; but a giant of the name of Gates, with a parcel of New-England men, came out again&s;t him and caught him by the beard, and &s;mote him, &s;o that his proclamatory voice &s;hall not be heard any more, in the woods of North-America.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid, that Burgoyne, in the man|ner of the great Quixotte, had built up him&s;elf,
<PB N="68" REF="015748_0068_0F9A271B8FEB8408">
on the &s;y&s;tem of the early battle-men. He had not read &s;o fully as that celebrated Spaniard, the hi&s;tory of the renowned Amadis de Gaul, Don Belli|anis of Greece, or the Seven Champions of Chri&s;|tendom; but he had &s;tudied, what was equally im|proving, the exploits of Mahoment the &s;econd, and of Tamarlane who put Bajazet in an iron cage, and made u&s;e of him as a block to a&s;&s;i&s;t him when at any time he &s;hould chu&s;e to mount his hor&s;e. He had made him&s;elf acquainted with the great killing times, at &s;everal periods, on the border of the Greek and Roman empires, &s;o that if the hero of Cervantes had it in his power to boa&s;t a &s;upe|rior knowledge in the laws of chivalry and knight|hood, yet the Briti&s;h general was con&s;iderably be|fore him in the &s;kill of Cae&s;ar-hood and Alexander-&s;hip. That you may know what I mean, it mu&s;t be told you, that it is the humour of the&s;e great combatants, to cut and carve furiou&s;ly about them, and to rage and rave like angry lions, or like mad tygers, until they have &s;lain half the world of in|habitants; and then to &s;it down, and be as tame as a dog that has ju&s;t chewed a bone, or as a young ox that licks his lips after &s;alt.</P>
<P>The above may &s;erve as a key to the famous &s;peech of Burgoyne, before he left England, pro|mi&s;ing to <HI>temper his puni&s;hment to the Americans with humanity.</HI> It may &s;erve to explain that de|claration al&s;o, that he would <HI>dance with the ladies, and coax the men to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion;</HI> for you mu&s;t be told, if you know it not already, that it is the humour of your well bred &s;laughter-men, to be highly complai|&s;ant, gentle and humane, to a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed lady, the very next hour after they have cut the throat of a fond hu&s;band, or an only &s;on, or beloved brother. Of this you have an in&s;tance in the behaviour of the Macedonian, to the wife and mother of Darius, whom a few hours before, he had unju&s;tly &s;lain,
<PB N="69" REF="015748_0069_0F9A275D2B461830">
and ba&s;ely deprived of his kingdom.&mdash;It was &s;omething of this nature which Burgoyne would have us under&s;tand by the <HI>honour of a &s;oldier,</HI> of which he &s;peaks in his proclamation. For though he had let loo&s;e, or as he him&s;elf terms it, <HI>given &s;tretch</HI> to the Indian forces under his command, to murder the infant, and the young &s;oldier, and the mother, and the virgin, on her bridal day; yet this did not hinder, but that when he came to Albany victorious, he might &s;hew him&s;elf a generous con|queror, by wiping away the tears of the mourning family, as Alexander wiped away the tears of Sta|tira.</P>
<P>There is another &s;pecies of writing not le&s;s fami|liar to the general, and that is the French and Eng|li&s;h tragedy. Hence it is that he hath drawn many of tho&s;e noble flights of fancy, conceived in very lofty language, which appear in his &s;peeches and epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence. The &s;entence which may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of many others, &s;ays to this purpo&s;e; <HI>I would not be ju&s;tly chargeable with &s;uch pro|ceeding, no, not for North-America, had &s;he the wealth of worlds, in her bowels, and a paradi&s;e upon her &s;urface.</HI></P>
<P>It is thought by &s;ome young gentlemen to whom I have the honour to be known, that Burgoyne hath in this &s;entence caught &s;omething of the true &s;pirit and &s;ublime of the antient authors. The ta&s;te of the&s;e young gentlemen is accurate and good; for I defy you to impo&s;e upon them a ham of bacon, for a &s;ea-turtle, or a di&s;h of turnips, for a bowl of eg|nog. The only objection that any man can offer to their judgement, is, that, <HI>his non erat locus</HI>&mdash;The&s;e words are not in their proper place, and do not &s;o well &s;uit a letter upon bu&s;ine&s;s, as a &s;peech of An|thony to Cleopatra, or of Herod the great, to his Mariamne.</P>
<P>The General in many places, &s;hines out in &s;uch high-winged and &s;ilver-tongued words. It is his
<PB N="70" REF="015748_0070_0F9A275DEBF518F8">
happine&s;s to have &s;o rich a vein of tragic fancy, and high flight of dramatic thought, that on occa|&s;ions very common, he can get upon his bu&s;kins, and talk&mdash;<HI>rotundo ore</HI>&mdash;with a &s;welling mouth.</P>
<P>When, therefore, we &s;um up the evidence, and con&s;ider that the general hath a mo&s;t intimate ac|quaintance with all Homer's heroes; that he hath at his fingers ends, all the great examples of the an|tient hi&s;tory; that to this he hath added a full and univer&s;al reading of the be&s;t Engli&s;h plays, and particularly that of the two rival queens, writ by the immortal <HI>Lee</HI>&mdash;when to clo&s;e and compleat the whole, we take it into view that he hath drawn copiou&s;ly of rich &s;tile and &s;entiment, from this &s;ource, or rather the&s;e &s;ources; need we wonder that when he came upon this we&s;tern continent, a new world, and a new &s;tage opening to his view, he hath &s;poken great things.</P>
<P N="2">II. Bla&s;phemies. Here I mean to be &s;erious. The word bla&s;phemy is of Greek original, and is made up of two words, one of which is&mdash;to wound, and the other is&mdash;the reputation. According to its etymology, it is what is wounding to the reputation. It is the Greek word for calumny, and an&s;wers to one we have borrowed from the latin&mdash;defa|mation. I have not any author by me to e&s;tabli&s;h it; yet I make no doubt, but that at fir&s;t it was u&s;ed to &s;ignify a &s;lander again&s;t the character of men, as well as again&s;t the providence of God. After a little time, in the manner of many words, it lo&s;t a part of its original application; and by it we now under&s;tand what is &s;aid in derogation of the divine Maje&s;ty of heaven, either in the per&s;ons of the Trinity, his attributes, or providence This is the &s;trict and higher &s;en&s;e; yet, no doubt, a word may be occa&s;ionally and by con&s;truction bla&s;|phemous. The man that declares to the world, that he will do this or that, and at the &s;ame time
<PB N="71" REF="015748_0071_0F9A275EAA4A9578">
pays no attention to the permi&s;&s;ion of divine pro|vidence, makes a near approach to that which is called bla&s;phemy. It ought to be our language, that if God will, we &s;hall do &s;o. What, &s;o to &s;peak can be more wounding to his reputation in who&s;e hands our breath is, and who&s;e are all our ways, than not to acknowledge him, when we engage in any matter, or not to give him thanks, when, with his help, we have been enabled to perform it? It is trea&s;on to the monarchy of heaven. It is bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>Let us apply this to the proclamation of which we have &s;aid &s;ome things laughingly. Omitting the invective and fal&s;hood contained in it; even the &s;oul of a tory mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that with regard to God, it is daringly impious and profane. Except in one &s;light phra&s;e, he pays not the lea&s;t attention to the almighty providence, who rules and governs all things: and even this &s;light phra&s;e is crouded down, and di&s;appears in the boa&s;t and ranting of the other periods. Self-dependent, and balanced on his &s;trength, he &s;eems to look down with &s;corn, on all the ca&s;ualties of circum&s;tance and time.</P>
<P>"At the head of troops in the full powers of health, di&s;cipline and valour, determined to &s;trike where nece&s;&s;ary, and anxious to &s;pare where po&s;&s;i|ble, I invite and exhort all per&s;ons, in all places, where the progre&s;s of this army &s;hall point&mdash;<HI>And by the ble&s;&s;ing of God I will extend it far.</HI>" The la&s;t words of this &s;entence make the phra&s;e to which I have a reference as that &s;eeming to hold forth &s;omething rational, and pious. Yet if you examine its po&s;ition, and the manner of its flow in the &s;en|tence, you will find that it is not &s;o much an ac|knowledgment of the &s;uperintendency of God, as an oath that verily in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition, he will do what he had propo&s;ed. It differs little from the common declaration of a &s;oldier &s;wear|ing by the almighty, that in &s;pite of fortune he
<PB N="72" REF="015748_0072_0F9A275F69C9A5A8">
will do it. The be&s;t that we can &s;ay of it, is, that when he meant to pray, he naturally fell into the idiom of an oath. Such is the force of habit, on the human mind, and &s;o hard is it to &s;peak in a language different from that to which we have been long accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>But if he meant it even &s;erious, it has &s;omething in its nature bla&s;phemous; for if it is wounding to the character of God, the great di&s;po&s;er of events, to deny his kind and good providence, &s;urely it is &s;o likewi&s;e, to a&s;k his countenance and aid, in a cour&s;e of action diametrically oppo&s;ite to ju&s;tice and to truth. What?&mdash; &s;hall it be your de|&s;ign to &s;trip, rob, and cut the throats of men and mankind, and &s;hall you in the mean time a&s;k the ble&s;&s;ing of God in the execution of it? It is an in&s;ult upon heaven. It is bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>I remark farther on the proclamation; that it &s;eems to adopt the &s;tile of the &s;acred book, and &s;peaks of tho&s;e called rebels as the &s;cripture &s;peaks of reprobated men after death. The Briti&s;h army are <HI>the me&s;&s;engers of ju&s;tice and of wrath;</HI> and tho&s;e which &s;hall be &s;o unhappy as to fall into their hands <HI>are the wilful outca&s;ts.</HI> This is arrogancy to a high degree, for it is more than falls to the &s;hare of man to apply to him&s;elf or claim.</P>
<P>Such was the language of the general with regard to what he had in view to do. Not le&s;s exce&s;&s;ive was it in the account of what he had already done. Of this, his letter to lord George Germaine, on the reduction of Ticonderoga, may be &s;elected as an evidence. It is pompous in idea, and conceived in very lofty terms. Were one to read it over, it would naturally extend his mouth as if he had been u&s;ed to pronounce the high heroic &s;cenes of &s;ome &s;welling tragedy. When you hear him de&s;cribe the mount, who&s;e top, and gradual a&s;cent was co|vered with artillery: when you con&s;ider the ob|&s;tructions
<PB N="73" REF="015748_0073_0F9A276029A0A1A8">
of the booms and &s;unken piers through which he made his way: when you li&s;ten to the great addre&s;s of his officers and men in &s;caling, and climbing over the&s;e, you would &s;uppo&s;e that each of them was at lea&s;t a Themi&s;tocles, and that the general him&s;elf had done more than Alex|ander did, when he took by &s;torm the city of the Ty|rians, having fir&s;t in &s;pite of winds and a thou&s;and &s;torms, built a mole in the &s;ea to join the i&s;land to the continent. A ga&s;conade of this nature be|comes irreligious, when it is not accompanied with the lea&s;t idea of gratitude to God for that wherein he had &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>Taking the&s;e things into view, we may ea&s;ily ac|count for the ignominious exit of Burgoyne. It is to be re&s;olved not &s;o much into our &s;kill and bra|very, as into the providence of God, which he had &s;lighted and de&s;pi&s;ed. He had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the only po&s;t of con&s;equence, where he had ex|pected oppo&s;ition. He had hung on the rear of our broken army, and had taken camp-equipage and pri&s;oners. He had penetrated through a great depth of country, and the road to victory was now &s;mooth before him. At this very in&s;tant he is de|&s;erted of his wonted prudence. It behoved him to have marched on, with his whole army &s;olidly, and to have given no time to the troops before him, to re-a&s;&s;emble, or to rally. His great &s;trength lay in continnuing &s;elf-collected and impenetrable to our &s;maller bodies. But how providentially for us, do we find him &s;ending out his army by detach|ments! Hence it was that in the very triumph of &s;ucce&s;s, like an eagle that hath &s;tooped for a lamb, and mounted to the clouds, he was wounded with an arrow, and brought down again. Pride and &s;elf-confidence was the effect of his &s;ucce&s;s, and it became the cau&s;e of his future lo&s;&s;es, and his la&s;t cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="015748_0074_0F9A276192ED0FF0">From what we have &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, may there not ari&s;e &s;ome pertinent reflections? It is the duty and intere&s;t of every man, who a&s;pires to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a happy &s;ucce&s;s, in that to which he puts his hand, that he acknowledge God, and have an eye to his Almighty providence. <HI>God re|&s;i&s;teth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</HI> Let me &s;ee a man go forth in any enterprize, confiding in his own &s;kill, re&s;olution, or diligence, and paying no attention to the great di&s;po&s;er of events, and I think I &s;hall pretty generally be right, if I ven|ture to fore-tell to him that he &s;hall not pro&s;per in it. God is repre&s;ented in the &s;acred book as jea|lous of his glory. He will not fail to a&s;&s;ert his &s;o|vereignty over tho&s;e who deny it, and by a proud vaunt and boa&s;ting of their own great &s;trength and prowe&s;s, do virtually preclude the nece&s;&s;ity of the divine interpo&s;ition and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>We are told in the antient hi&s;tories, of &s;ome great and fortunate commander, who&s;e name I cannot now recollect, that in recounting his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, he ad|ded frequently, at the end of each relation, <HI>and in this fortune had no &s;hare,</HI> after which it is remark|able, that he never once more &s;ucceeded in any un|dertaking.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;yrian monarch is an in&s;tance of the &s;ame nature. Under God he had done very great things. He had over-run half the world with his arms. He had built Babylon for the domicilium of his em|pire. The temple of Belus, in magnitude and height, equalled the large&s;t of the pyramids of Egypt. His gardens hanging in the air, and groves planted on a level with the clouds, were a &s;ight new and admirable to the eye of man. His palace for its architecture far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed any thing that had ever been in the world before this period. In this palace it is &s;aid he walked, and, it was mo&s;t pro|bably, in &s;ome lofty &s;tory of it whence he could
<PB N="75" REF="015748_0075_0F9A2761AC8C9250">
have a view of the whole city, as it lay beneath him. His vain heart &s;welling with its pride, he breaks forth in a &s;train of &s;elf-applau&s;e and arro|gance, not to be endured by the God of heaven. <HI>Is not this great Babylon that I have built for the hou&s;e of my kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my maje&s;ty?</HI> And while the word was in his mouth, a voice fell from heaven, and no doubt it came with an awful &s;hock to his &s;oul, <HI>O king, to thee is it &s;poken; the kingdom is departed from thee.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;aying is as good as it is old, and as expre&s;|&s;ive as it is &s;imple, that <HI>pride goes before a fall.</HI> It is the hi&s;tory of many men, that they have flouri&s;hed and continued to a&s;cend in the world for a time; but by and by have experienced a rever&s;e of for|tune, and were again da&s;hed down. It is the hi&s;to|ry of many people, that they have endured pover|ty, and pain, and at length &s;urmounted the&s;e; but that now, almo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed in plenty and in ea&s;e, they have become viciou&s;ly &s;ecure, and are &s;truck from the happine&s;s which they had in view.

<P>It is for this rea&s;on that I look upon the pre&s;ent to be the mo&s;t critical point of time, that has yet revolved to America. We &s;et out very weak, and we were &s;ure of the providence of God, becau&s;e we were &s;ure that we needed it. We were beaten very low, and we de&s;paired not, becau&s;e there were many in&s;tances of tho&s;e who had emerged from the deepe&s;t &s;ituation of trouble and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>I have &s;aid that the pre&s;ent time is a <HI>cri&s;is</HI> to A|merica. We are in that &s;ituation where a rever&s;e of fortune doth u&s;ually take place. We have ex|perienced for &s;ome time pa&s;t a high flow and full gale of continued &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The latter end of the la&s;t campaign was <HI>critical</HI> to the Briti&s;h arms in America. They had reduced fort Wa&s;hington, and travelled through the Jer&s;ies.
<PB N="78" REF="015748_0078_0F9A2763E9F614A8">
They had obliged us with a few troops to retire on this &s;ide the Delaware. What now remained but the full ta&s;te of triumph, and the fruits of victory? They had reached a &s;ummit, and this was the <HI>cri|&s;is.</HI> From the eminence attained, they now began to decline down the hill. This is no more than what is u&s;ual to tho&s;e, who, flattered by &s;ucce&s;s, look upon their work as already done.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent time is a <HI>cri&s;is</HI> to America. We have vanqui&s;hed Burgoyne. We have reached a ve|ry great eminence. Let us &s;o behave, that provi|dence, may not in ju&s;tice and in puni&s;hment fix it down as the &s;ummit to which we &s;hall attain. Let not &s;ecurity take the place of prudence. We have yet a great height of mountain to a&s;cend. It would be the be&s;t policy of general Howe and the devil, if they knew it, to give way, and make as if they were beaten altogether, &s;o that by and by they might return again, and taking us unguarded, deal a &s;everer blow. On the other hand, it is our be&s;t policy to be upon our guard, and notwith&s;tanding our late &s;ucce&s;s and victory, not to tempt provi|dence by a remi&s;&s;ion of our vigilance and care&mdash;not to offend the great arbiter of cau&s;es, by giving way to vain glory and a boa&s;ting &s;pirit, while our deli|verance is yet incompleat, and it remains to be decided, whether we &s;hall live freemen, or be made &s;laves.</P>

<HEAD>THE GREAT WRATH OF THE TYRANT, AND THE CAUSE OF IT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>Having great wrath, becau&s;e he knoweth that he hath but a &s;hort time.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Rev. xii, 12.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words are characteri&s;tic of the devil, who, in the late age of the world, and ju&s;t before the <HI>millenium,</HI> is about to act with redoubled fury, knowing, that in a &s;hort time, he &s;hall be &s;hut up in the dark abode of hell, not to vex or di&s;turb the human race any more. It is the ca&s;e not only with the devil, but with all who in any &s;hape re&s;emble him, that they vent them&s;elves the more outragiou&s;ly, in proportion as the time is &s;hort in which they have any hope of opportunity to exerci&s;e their vengeance. It is the ca&s;e particu|larly with the tyrant of Great-Britain, who at this time hath made war upon us&mdash;He hath had great wrath; and it is becau&s;e he knoweth that he hath but a &s;hort time&punc;</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="80" REF="015748_0080_0F9A27656B77C308">1. He hath had great wrath. It is u&s;ual in lan|guage when a man is angry, for him&s;elf as well as others to &s;ay that he is mad. He is mad with rage&mdash;you have made me mad and the like. Nor is there &s;o great an impropriety in the&s;e words as may at fir&s;t be imagined; for according to the an|tient, <HI>anger is a &s;hort madne&s;s.</HI> Pa&s;&s;ion of any kind and more e&s;pecially that of anger, di&s;turbs or pre|vents any exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, &s;o that the &s;ubject of it, in the wildne&s;s of his looks, the impetuo&s;ity of words, and the extravagance of action, &s;hall differ little from a madman. In the &s;ally of re&s;entment he &s;hall take the way to gratify it which is not on|ly mo&s;t ineffectual to hurt the per&s;on with whom he is offended, but is mo&s;t deadly and de&s;tructive to him&s;elf. An eager thir&s;t of revenge will prompt a man to engage in a duel with a more &s;kilful ad|ver&s;ary, and to ri&s;k his life with but half a chance, forthe pre&s;ervation of it. At the &s;ame time, the blind and incon&s;iderate fury of his rage, will per|fectly de&s;troy that &s;mall &s;hare of &s;kill and prudence which he may have had, and render him an ea&s;y prey to the more cool and deliberate combatant.</P>
<P>We &s;aw this remarkably in the direction of the war waged by the tyrant. He was principally en|raged with the four New-England provinces&punc; and therefore was di&s;po&s;ed to make the&s;e the fir&s;t ex|amples of his vengeance. Prompted by his pa&s;&s;ion, this quarter of the confederate colonies he attack|ed fir&s;t, contrary to the well e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim&mdash; <HI>Seek the weak &s;ide of an enemy.</HI> Had he brought his fir&s;t ten thou&s;and men up the Bay of Che&s;apeak, and made his inroad on the then unarmed, undi&s;ciplin|ed, and defencele&s;s Penn&s;ylvanians, he might have effectuated &s;omething. But &s;o inveterate was his rage again&s;t the people of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay province in particular, that the&s;e he mu&s;t attack fir&s;t, though he well knew, that of all the Ameri|cans,
<PB N="81" REF="015748_0081_0F9A27662BB6F2D0">
they were the be&s;t prepared to receive him. This province, which at that time might be ac|accounted the citadel, he continued with unavail|ing a&s;&s;iduity to batter, until the other parts of the empire were put into a po&s;ture of defence, and rendered equally impregnable to his a&s;&s;ault. Thus it may be &s;aid that the tyrant hath been mad with rage&mdash;that his anger hath over&s;hot his wit, and that from a de&s;ire in&s;tantly to &s;atiate his ma|lice, he hath lo&s;t the opportunity to &s;atiate it at all.</P>
<P>The madne&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ion was equally ob&s;erv|able in many other parts of his behaviour. His bu|&s;ine&s;s was to rob, and it was his wi&s;dom to have at|tempted it, like a man of honour, &s;o that many might give up their pur&s;e with &s;ome degree of rea|dine&s;s, taken with the gallant look of the high|way-man, and the politene&s;s of the manner in which it was demanded. "Gentlemen, he might have &s;aid, I am in want of money, and you mu&s;t pardon me if I take the freedom to reque&s;t a little. You &s;ee my arms, and my capacity to force it from you; neverthele&s;s I &s;corn any ungentlemanly and unfair advantage Equip your&s;elves, and come out and fight with me, and my retinue, in even play and fair ho&s;tility. I &s;corn the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the He&s;|&s;ian offered me from Germany&mdash;the Negro, or the Indian, to &s;hed the blood of Chri&s;tians. If I cannot conquer you my&s;elf, I will di&s;dain to take your money. Ladies in the coach be ea&s;y and compo&s;e your&s;elves. I make not war upon the fairer &s;ex. It is your hu&s;bands with whom I am to combat."</P>
<P>Very contrary to this was the behaviour of the tyrant. By his grim threats, cruel outrage, and ba&s;e barbarity, he at once di&s;covered him&s;elf to be a ruffian and a villain. The pa&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul was too dark and gloomy to admit the appearance of &s;o much gallantry and &s;prightline&s;s, but which, if
<PB N="82" REF="015748_0082_0F9A2766E9D4BD80">
exerci&s;ed, would have been the only mo&s;t effectual way to have gained his purpo&s;e, and prevented that declaration of independence and &s;eparation from his empire, which, in con&s;equence of his brutality, hath taken place upon the continent.</P>
<P>It is evident from the bad policy of all his man|ners, that the tyrant hath been mad; and to what can we attribute this, &s;o naturally as to the &s;trength of his re&s;entment, which hurried him impetuou&s;ly to gratify it, without attention to the rules of pru|dence, or the maxims of experience. He hath been mad with rage. Like a madman he hath been impolitic, but at the &s;ame time violent. His rage hath been exerted without &s;kill, but at the &s;ame time with great &s;trength and great cruelty. He hath had great wrath.</P>
<P>I need not write, nor de&s;cribe it to you. It is writ in blood. You may ca&s;t up your eye, and read it on every height from Bunker's-hill to fort Sullivan&mdash;on the heights of Abraham&mdash;on the heights of Danbury&mdash;on the heights of the Hud&s;on-river&mdash; on the heights of Raritan&mdash;on the heights of Dela|ware&mdash;on the heights of Schuylkill&mdash;on the heights of Brandywine.</P>
<P>Some time ago we read &s;ad appearances of blood|&s;hed, in the fiery vapours &s;pread upon the north. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aurora borealis.</HI></NOTE> Ah! my countrymen, you may read it much better, not in the firmament, but upon the earth. The He&s;&s;ian hath writ in blood&mdash;the Indian hath writ in blood&mdash;the Briti&s;h &s;oldiery hath writ in blood. Here lies a Warren&mdash;here lies a Mont|gomery&mdash;here lies a Mercer&mdash;a Ha&s;let&mdash;a Wor&s;ter&mdash;a Harkemer&mdash;a Na&s;h&mdash;a Wither|&s;poon. The wrath of the tyrant, in blood-red cha|racters hath been writ by every one of the&s;e. He hath had great wrath, and</P>
<P N="2">II. It is becau&s;e he knoweth that he hath but a &s;hort time. The tyrant very early had &s;o much
<PB N="83" REF="015748_0083_0F9A2767AB7029B8">
glimmering of light upon his mind, as to &s;ee what was very ea&s;y to be &s;een, that the&s;e colonies could not be very long a member of his empire. It was therefore his policy, he apprehended, to make the be&s;t u&s;e of them, while he had them in his power. For this purpo&s;e he laid the &s;tamp-act upon them, in order to enrich him&s;elf, and at the &s;ame time keep them low, and at a greater di&s;tance from that period, when con&s;cious of their own importance, they might be di&s;po&s;ed to throw off all &s;ubjection to his authority. In the impo&s;ition of this tax he found a greater &s;pirit of re&s;i&s;tance than he had ex|pected, and therefore thought it prudent to repeal it for the pre&s;ent. Sen&s;ible that he had aimed a mo&s;t unfriendly &s;tab at the vitals of our liberty, he did not think it po&s;&s;ible that we could in any future time forgive him. Thus he was enraged again&s;t us, be|cau&s;e he was per&s;uaded that we mu&s;t be enraged again&s;t him. So true it is that <HI>he who injures never can forgive.</HI> His fancy and imagination whirled in a perpetual fit of jealou&s;y. He felt within him&s;elf, that he had intended the greate&s;t injury, and there|fore ju&s;tly thought, that the people again&s;t whom it was intended mu&s;t have conceived an an&s;werable indignation. He was convinced that it was our true and be&s;t intere&s;t, to break off all connection with him; and therefore judged that we mu&s;t be di&s;|po&s;ed to take the fir&s;t opportunity to do it. <HI>A &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence is wor&s;e than a &s;tate of di&s;appointment.</HI> His eager and unquiet &s;pirit prompted him, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to make the experiment, and to &s;ee whe|ther the Americans had really tho&s;e de&s;igns of &s;e|paration, which his own evil and foreboding fears had given him to believe they began to entertain. He openly a&s;&s;erts the claim of binding them <HI>in all ca&s;es what&s;oever,</HI> and thus immediately brings about that e&s;tabli&s;hment of an independent empire in Ameri|ca,
<PB N="84" REF="015748_0084_0F9A27686A793EC8">
which otherwi&s;e might have &s;lept in embryo, for two or three ages.</P>
<P>When the claim was denied, and the attempt to enforce it was re&s;i&s;ted, he waxed very wroth, but was not yet come to the height of rage and de&s;|peration. He had &s;till &s;ome fluctuating hope that he &s;hould be able to reduce us for the pre&s;ent, and hold us &s;ome longer time in &s;ubjection. At the commencement of the debate he was plea&s;ant in his manner, and talked much of clemency. It was &s;ome time before he u&s;ed the word&mdash;<HI>rebels.</HI> His deluded and mi&s;taken &s;ubjects was the term. Dur|ing the blockade of Bo&s;ton he confined our pri&s;o|ners to dungeons, and to jail, but did not put them to death by famine, and the &s;upply of vitiated food. He &s;hed our blood in the Bunker-hill engage|ment; but we do not hear that he butchered the wounded, or refu&s;ed quarter to any &s;upplicating for their life. He &s;et fire to Charles-town, but this was rather to &s;kreen his own cowardice behind the &s;moke, than with a de&s;ign to de&s;olate the country. In proportion as he became le&s;s &s;anguine in his hope of reducing us, he became more outrageous, and barbarous in his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>It was not until his departure from Virginia, that he &s;et fire to the town of Norfolk. It was not un|til his retreat from the White Plains, that he be|gan to burn dwelling hou&s;es, and lay wa&s;te our &s;ettlements. It was not until he had ingloriou&s;ly withdrawn from this tract of country, and retired back into New-York, that he began to &s;hew the ci|vilized world &s;omething to a&s;toni&s;h them, in the u&s;age of the unhappy pri&s;oners of Fort-Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>It was not until his inroad through the Jer&s;ies that he let fully flip the hounds that followed him, to lap, and fea&s;t luxuriou&s;ly upon the blood of men. It was not until this time that he mangled the wounded on the field of battle, and &s;tabed unpitiedly the &s;ol|dier
<PB N="85" REF="015748_0085_0F9A2769D70CC1C0">
&s;upplicating for his life. It was not until his departure from this &s;tate, that he &s;o wantonly every where began to burn and de&s;troy the buildings and edifices of the country through which he made his rout.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t campaign he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all that he had done before. In the retreat of Clinton from the neighbourhood of Albany, he con&s;umed every fine building on each &s;ide of the Hud&s;on river. He laid in ruins the beautiful and plea&s;ant &s;treets of E&s;opus or King&s;ton. He burned many other &s;mal|ler villages, and marked every ve&s;tige of his pro|gre&s;s with wa&s;te and de&s;olation.</P>
<P>In the inroad of Burgoyne he &s;tirred up the &s;avages to come down upon us, and with more inhumanity than u&s;ual even to him&s;elf, he en|couraged them by a reward to &s;calp and murder the inhabitants in their places of abode. He ordered our pri&s;oners, under the very eye of the Briti&s;h troops, to be gnawed upon by the&s;e <HI>dogs of hell.</HI> He murderou&s;ly &s;ent them in among&s;t the trembling captives, and in the manner of the Canibals of South-America, cau&s;ed them to chu&s;e out the fatte&s;t, that they might put their knives in him, and fea&s;t upon his limbs with a hor|rid appetite <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the depo&s;ition of Doctor Young Love.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In his progre&s;s through the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylva|nia, we have heard the cry of the ravi&s;hed virgin, and the murdered &s;oldier, and have &s;een every horrid act perpetrated that can di&s;grace the memo|ry of wicked and apo&s;tate men. The &s;oft-expo&s;|tulating &s;ouls that want bread in the jails of Phi|ladelphia, recal the memory of fort Wa&s;hington, and lodge a new complaint in the ear of the God of heaven, and in the ears of their countrymen.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="015748_0086_0F9A2769EF426768">I expect that next campaign, if the tyrant is able to effect an inroad, he will vent his fury with a &s;till more di&s;pairing vengeance. <HI>We may gue&s;s his lo&s;s of hope by his increa&s;e of wrath.</HI> When his rage is come to the very height, &s;o that no gleam of hu|manity remains to temperate his actions, we may conclude that it is over with him and the day of our deliverance draweth nigh. Thus, that hour is the darke&s;t which precedes the break of day, and February, which is the la&s;t month, is the colde&s;t and mo&s;t &s;tormy of the wintry year.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that it is probable the tyrant will act, in the next campaign, with a &s;till more di&s;pairing vengeance. When I ruminate upon it, I do not &s;ee that he has any thing to add, to the gloomy cata|logue of his former cruelties. It is true he might a&s;&s;a&s;inate and endeavour to &s;atisfy his malice by the private death of &s;ome of our greate&s;t &s;tate&s;men, and brave&s;t heroes; but this is what he hath al|ready plotted, and endeavoured to accompli&s;h. The dark &s;cene of hell laid again&s;t our general, on York-I&s;land, is an evidence of this; And the late attempt made again&s;t the great FRANKLIN at the court of France, &s;ets it beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of doubt. It would &s;eem therefore that nothing bar|barous or cruel of a new nature remains for him to perpetrate. If &s;o, may we not hope that he has run his round, and that &s;hortly his opportunity of &s;hewing him&s;elf barbarous and cruel to Americans, &s;hall be made to cea&s;e?</P>
<P>It is indeed devoutly to be wi&s;hed; for much pain and &s;ore calamity is yet upon us; and many poor families driven from their places of abode, &s;uffer in the conte&s;t. Well might it have been &s;aid with a reference to this war, as in the words of the &s;crip|ture immediately preceeding tho&s;e prefixed to this di&s;cour&s;e. <HI>Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and the &s;ea, for the devil is come down unto you.</HI> The devil is

indeed come down in the &s;ervice of the tyrant. We have felt his fury on the <HI>land</HI> We have felt it on the <HI>&s;ea.</HI> Many of our poor &s;ailors, taken by him, hath he forced to act again&s;t the cau&s;e in which we are engaged and to do reluctantly that which the principle of con&s;cience di&s;approves. Many of them hath he &s;hut down in the dark holds of ve&s;&s;els to lament the lo&s;t light and the hope of day. Many of them hath he &s;ent away to the &s;corched i&s;les, where &s;lavery takes place, and where hot fevers &s;oon fix a limit to the life of man.</P>
<P>The time of war is the devil's time. War is not friendly to religion.&mdash;It is not friendly to the &s;ci|ences. Animo&s;ity and blood&s;hed is unfavourable to all that is good and u&s;eful on the earth. I tru&s;t we &s;hall &s;oon be delivered from the nece&s;&s;ity of wading in it.</P>
<P>The reign of the tyrant is the reign of &s;atan. I tru&s;t that a &s;hort &s;pace of time &s;hall fix the limit to them both. War and fierce debate &s;hall &s;hew them&s;elves no more. Tranquility and days of happine&s;s &s;hall again be ours. The hu&s;bandman now de&s;titute of habitation, &s;hall return to his dwelling-hou&s;e. The tear &s;hall be wiped from the eye of the fair virgin, driven from the city, where &s;he had been delicately bred. The pri&s;oner &s;hall be lifted from the jail, and have his name placed with tho&s;e who have &s;uffered for their country. The &s;oldier &s;hall retire from the danger of the camp, and the wooden leg and the grey hairs of valour &s;hall be honourable. Hi&s;torians &s;hall hear from him the tale of that which he did in battle. They &s;hall dip their pens in the lu&s;tre of his fame, and give immortality to what they write.</P>
<P>Be cheared, O my country, for thy garden-bow|ers, and thy walls &s;hall be built again. Thy meads &s;hall be decked with gra&s;s, and the grain &s;hall be heavy on thy fields. The villages &s;hall ri&s;e from

their rubbi&s;h and their &s;moke, and new towns &s;hall &s;mile along thy &s;treams.</P>
<P>Commerce &s;hall extend her wings, and come from every &s;hore. It will be plea&s;ant to &s;ee a new <HI>Ex|change</HI> in every fair metropolis upon our coa&s;t. It will be plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve every nation in their proper dre&s;s about to barter their commodities upon our wharfs&mdash;The native of Bencoolen, of Su|matra, of Borneo, and the Malayan, with his pearl fi&s;hed from the bottom of the &s;ea&mdash;The Turk with his Turban on his head&mdash;the Venetian&mdash; the Genoe&s;e&mdash;the Frenchman&mdash;the Dane&mdash;the Por|tugue&s;e&mdash;the Dutchman, and the Engli&s;hman him|&s;elf taught the arts of peace.</P>
<P>Science &s;hall be planted in our country, and many &s;eminaries &s;hall again &s;hew their heads. Like fair lights, and pyramids of fire, they &s;hall &s;hoot up in every &s;tate. The mu&s;es every where &s;hall &s;trew the land with flowers; and &s;lumbering bards &s;hall yet awake, to &s;ing of nature, and the prai&s;e of men.</P>
<P>Religion &s;hall again come down and live upon the earth. Free exerci&s;e of con&s;cience &s;hall be allow|ed every where. Bigotry&mdash;vile bigotry that &s;prings from ignorance, &s;hall fly away. Truth, pure truth &s;hall di&s;pel the fog and vapour of the mind. The light of knowledge, like the light of day &s;hall kindle heat in the pious &s;oul. Days, happy days are yet before us.</P>
<P>The devil, in equal mea&s;ure with the tyrant, hath had great wrath, and it is <HI>becau&s;e he knoweth that he hath but a &s;hort time.</HI> He hath been let loo&s;e for a while, but after he hath taken a turn or two more, he &s;hall be &s;hut down in the lake of hell. He &s;hall carry with him bla&s;phemy, and oaths, and profane &s;wearing&punc; We &s;hall have fair weather at the clearing up of this &s;torm.</P>
<P>Let the&s;e bright ages ha&s;ten on, and to God, with whom all time, and &s;ituation, and event is in&s;crutably laid up, be the glory. Amen.</P>
