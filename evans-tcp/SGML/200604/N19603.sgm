<P>I CAN no longer with&s;tand the importunity of my Maria, but will ha&s;ten to improve every opportunity in gratifying your repeated &s;olicitations.</P>
<P>You urge me, my dear, to return to the earlie&s;t period of my life, and to draw the picture from my fir&s;t recollection of events. The juvenile parts of life, Maria, are &s;el|dom marked with any great variety, al|though your Caroline's has been uncom|monly inter&s;per&s;ed with gloomy &s;cenes.</P>
<P>Being left in infancy, an orphan, I was committed to the care of an aunt, for whom, when rea&s;on began to dawn upon my mind, I felt no great attachment. My uncle, who was a &s;ea Captain, was &s;eldom at home; I had therefore but lit|tle opportunity to experience his affec|tions. My aunt, however, treated me with more attention, previous to her hav|ing a child, than afterwards. I now began
<PB N="6" REF="025584_0005_0FCE03B9D4D84208">
to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting her behaviour to me; but being naturally re|&s;erved, kept them to my&s;elf. I was &s;ome|times indulged in vi&s;iting an uncle and aunt, who, being without children, were de&s;irous I &s;hould re&s;ide with them; but the aunt with whom I was, would never con&s;ent.</P>
<P>From the birth of my cou&s;in, I found her &s;everity greatly increa&s;ed towards me. My feelings were &s;en&s;ibly injured by her treatment, but I knew of no redre&s;s, and dreaded her re&s;entment. I was therefore the more a&s;&s;iduous in my endeavours to plea&s;e, but to no effect. Upon a cur&s;ory acquaintance, &s;he was e&s;teemed as &s;en&s;ible and well bred; this was a thin veil, which a more intimate knowledge of her ea&s;ily drew a&s;ide. Shall I define her &s;en&s;e, Maria? It did not con&s;i&s;t in a pure and elevated under&s;tanding, which leads to &s;olid arguments and rea&s;onable conclu&s;ions: No, my dear; &s;he cheerfully relinqui&s;hed the dull road of &s;yllogi&s;tic di&s;putation, to the peevi&s;h &s;cholar and &s;our reclu&s;e, conceiving the &s;tudy of the ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ciences, as &s;he &s;tiled logical rea&s;oning, qualifications re|qui&s;ite
<PB N="7" REF="025584_0006_0FCE03BB1CF38F60">
only for the collegian and divine. With the&s;e ideas, her conver&s;ation was ever a &s;cene of illiberal contradictions.</P>
<P>It is common, however, for weak minds to have an exalted opinion of their own abilities; thus it was with my aunt; and to the mo&s;t con&s;ummate ignorance was added an overbearing di&s;po&s;ition. Young as I was, my feelings were &s;en&s;ibly injured by her conduct to my uncle, for whom &s;he ever experienced a violent pang of love or hatred; at times hanging around his neck and pouring forth a profu&s;ion of fond expre&s;&s;ions, then relap&s;ing into abu&s;e and ill treatment; extremely irritable and uncertain in her feelings and di&s;po&s;i|tion. My &s;ituation was peculiarly diffi|cult, and the example &s;et before me prejudi|cial to my happine&s;s; but in this &s;tate I re|mained until I was ten years old, when we received the melancholy news of my uncle's being drowned at &s;ea. This painful intel|ligence affected my aunt, as trouble invari|ably will per&s;ons of her ungovernable di&s;|po&s;ition, and &s;he was thrown into a mo|mentary &s;tate of di&s;traction. But the idea of being left &s;ole executrix to a hand&s;ome
<PB N="8" REF="025584_0007_0FCE03BC9ADA1988">
fortune, &s;oon mitigated her di&s;tre&s;s and ab|&s;orbed the pearly tear from the cheek of ex|ternal woe. Money, Maria, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a balmy power; it can even heal the wounds of the heart. My uncle and aunt Franklin thinking this a good opportunity to gain the con&s;ent of my aunt Noble, &s;olicited the indulgence of having me with them; but my &s;ervices were too nece&s;&s;ary for her to comply with their reque&s;t. Shortly after my uncle Noble's death, his brother lo&s;t his wife.</P>
<P>Colonel Noble was a very different man from his brother: Ambitious beyond what his &s;ituation in life could po&s;&s;ibly lead him to expect; vain of his imagined per&s;onal beauty, and extremely ignorant. My aunt, as &s;oon as decency would permit, began to di&s;play her charms, and made every advance which art could &s;ugge&s;t to gain his atten|tion. Her conduct expo&s;ed her to the ridicule of her acquaintance; for the fir&s;t advances to come from our &s;ex is, you know, my dear, derogatory to the deli|cacy of the female mind. Suffice it to &s;ay, by an unwearied a&s;&s;iduity and great gene|ro&s;ity to him and his family (for Colonel
<PB N="9" REF="025584_0008_0FCE03BFCF2BE558">
Noble's circum&s;tances were at this period embarra&s;&s;ed) &s;he &s;ucceeded in her favour|ite wi&s;h of becoming his wife; or, as &s;he in her refined &s;en&s;ibility termed it, "re|newed her fir&s;t marriage." As all the bale|ful qualities of ignorance were a&s;&s;imilated in this connection, the honey moon was &s;hort. The Colonel, by his fir&s;t wife, had three children, who &s;oon became the cau&s;e of contention. My aunt, by her entire ig|norance of mankind, and a want of one of the principal cardinal virtues, <HI>prudence,</HI> fooli&s;hly threw the fortune of her child, for whom &s;he was guardian, into the hands of her new hu&s;band, who&s;e embarra&s;&s;ed cir|cum&s;tances induced him to apply the prop|erty to family u&s;e; nor would his haughty di&s;po&s;ition permit him to render any ac|count of the monies received. This created daily di&s;putes. A prudent woman would have guarded again&s;t tho&s;e difficulties by appointing a new guardian, previous to her &s;econd marriage. His conduct enraged my aunt, and her &s;everity to his children increa&s;ed. Their contentions rendered me very unhappy, and finally threw me into a languid &s;tate. While thus indi&s;po&s;|ed,
<PB N="10" REF="025584_0009_0FCE03C127894AC8">
I repeatedly &s;olicited to &s;ee my uncle F. who was a phy&s;ician. He was at length &s;ent for; when he came, he was &s;urpri&s;ed at finding me &s;o unwell, and ob&s;erving my health required very great attention, in&s;i&s;t|ed upon my being removed to his hou&s;e, that he might have me under his immediate care. Thus was I relieved from that &s;cene of wretchedne&s;s in which the family of my aunt was continually involved. The fami|ly in which I was now placed were happy in them&s;elves, and a&s;&s;iduous to communi|cate happine&s;s to your Caroline. An ea&s;y mind, united with their inexpre&s;&s;ible kind|ne&s;s, &s;oon re&s;tored me to health. Hitherto my education had been cruelly neglected; this led them to pay a particular attention to my improvement, and they &s;hortly implanted in my brea&s;t a de&s;ire of knowledge. Ma&s;t|ers were liberally provided, and I was in|&s;tructed in all the branches of polite educa|tion. Re&s;pect to my aunt Noble required I &s;hould &s;ometimes vi&s;it her unhappy fami|ly; but as the&s;e vi&s;its were only to comply with a nece&s;&s;ary attention, I went but &s;el|dom. My de&s;ire of improvement daily in|crea&s;ed; and my clo&s;e attention to the dif|ferent
<PB N="11" REF="025584_0010_0FCE03C29A89B380">
branches of my education, gained the affection of my uncle and aunt Franklin, who were equally &s;olicitous to evince their attachment to their little orphan. But, Maria, death, envious of my felicity, in an unexpected moment, deprived me of my beloved aunt. This circum&s;tance &s;o di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed my uncle that he neglected his bu|&s;ine&s;s; nor could my clo&s;e&s;t attention re|&s;tore him to his former tranquillity. I had the misfortune to &s;ee him langui&s;h two years, when he fell a &s;acrifice to that &s;in|cere affection, which had ever de&s;ignated him an indulgent hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Thus was a connection, fraught with fe|licity to them&s;elves and friends, cut off in the zenith of dome&s;tic enjoyment: Nor could the eligible &s;ituation, in which this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing event placed me, &s;ooth my afflic|tion; it preyed upon my mind and injur|ed my health. Being left joint heir with my cou&s;in, then &s;tationed at Fort Pitt, I felt the nece&s;&s;ity of giving him the painful information of his uncle's death, and tak|ing &s;ome &s;teps for my future &s;ituation in life. The property left me was in the funds; the intere&s;t of which, while I re|mained

This made it nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould re&s;olve on &s;ome place where to remove. Thus, my dear, have I run through the juvenile parts of my life, which you will &s;ee have not been free from real &s;orrow to your friend,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Philadelphia.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BY the death of my uncle and aunt, I was left, my dear Maria, at an age the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be protected, expo&s;ed to the attack of every &s;educer. This reflec|tion the more readily induced me to return to the hou&s;e of Colonel Noble, thinking that as I now had it in my power to pay for my board, I &s;hould be le&s;s &s;ubject to their di&s;putes. I accordingly told my aunt, that as I wi&s;hed not to be interrupted by her family, if &s;he would accommodate me with a chamber to my&s;elf, I would board with her for a few months. To this &s;he cheerfully agreed; and I, from pre&s;ent ne|ce&s;&s;ity, returned to the place I mo&s;t de|te&s;ted in my heart.</P>
<P>My uncle Franklin, at his death, had left me the liberty of &s;electing from a valuable collection of books, tho&s;e which &s;uited my ta&s;te; from the peru&s;al of the&s;e I anticipat|ed &s;uperior gratification. In this I was di&s;|appointed. My aunt, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a com|municative
<PB N="14" REF="025584_0013_0FCE03C7D9ED0A08">
and repining di&s;po&s;ition, con|tinually intruded upon my retired mo|ments, embittering them with a con&s;tant repetition of her wretchedne&s;s; and I &s;oon repented of my folly in returning to her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Their quarrels ran high, and &s;everal days would frequently elap&s;e without their &s;peaking to each other: Nor did &s;he ever attempt to &s;ooth the pa&s;&s;ions of the Colonel; but irritated him in the mo&s;t abu&s;ive and imprudent manner. Thus tho&s;e breaches, which might have been healed by a &s;oft and conde&s;cending di&s;po&s;ition, were increa&s;ed until they became incurable wounds.</P>
<P>Her re&s;entment was not confined to the Colonel, but extended its &s;everity to his children. For her own child, all the feelings of a parental bo&s;om vegetated in luxuriance: If in the lea&s;t indi&s;po&s;ed, eve|ry luxury which the city afforded was pro|vided for her. Happy had it been, were &s;he di&s;po&s;ed to treat his former children with an equal degree of tenderne&s;s; &s;he might then have derived greater plea&s;ure from her connection.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="025584_0014_0FCE03CA35034DE8">In my ab&s;ence &s;he had made an addition to her family. The woman, Maria, who cannot re&s;olve fully to do the duty of a parent, certainly &s;hould not undertake the charge of children, who mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily look to her for in&s;truction and advice. It is requi&s;ite that &s;he conceals even the &s;ha|dow of a preference; for a partiality, once di&s;covered, le&s;&s;ens the confidence and af|fection of her hu&s;band, renders her di&s;re|&s;pected by the children, and depreciates her in the eyes of her dome&s;tics.</P>
<P>Another &s;ource of contention was her ex|treme attachment to cards; &s;he however per&s;i&s;ted in the indulgence of this pro|pen&s;ity. In playing for amu&s;ement only, there can be no real injury; but when the happine&s;s of our lives is &s;u&s;pended upon it, what inference can be drawn from our con|duct which is not derogatory to the under|&s;tanding of rational beings? This exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s for play, was very di&s;agreeable to the Colonel. A prudent woman would cheerfully have relinqui&s;hed &s;o trifling a gratification for the &s;ecurity of her dome&s;|tic happine&s;s, but his inclination &s;he &s;el|dom con&s;ulted: And &s;o infatuated was this
<PB N="16" REF="025584_0015_0FCE03CBA05E7408">
unhappy woman, that notwith&s;tanding his aver&s;ion, &s;he early <HI>in&s;tructed</HI> her children in the various games; and the younge&s;t, be|fore &s;ix years old, was a con&s;iderable profi|cient at cards. As &s;oon as the tea things were removed, loo, her favourite game, was introduced.</P>
<P>"From the inhuman treatment of her hu&s;band, her health (&s;he &s;aid) was greatly injured; amu&s;ement was nece&s;&s;ary for her." This mode of pa&s;&s;ing time was however totally repugnant to my wi&s;hes, yet I mu&s;t acquie&s;ce, or be thought to derogate from that politene&s;s and attention, nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved to an aunt.</P>
<P>Unfortunate at play, the company were frequently thrown into confu&s;ion by her re&s;entment; for &s;he &s;eldom aro&s;e from the table without con&s;iderable lo&s;s. This was an aggravation to my uncle, who, having no lucrative employment, made it nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould curtail his expen&s;es; though an ill-judged ambition and pride, the natural growth of ignorance, led him to &s;upport an external appearance, at the expen&s;e of many nece&s;&s;aries, for which his family &s;uffered.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="025584_0016_0FCE03CD1C6D9A68">My aunt had a &s;mall income of &s;ix|ty pounds per annum, &s;ettled upon her by a relation, to continue during her life, and then to devolve to her fir&s;t child. This but partially &s;upplied her with pock|et-money, for being what the world &s;tyles generous; but what your Caroline denom|inates prodigal; it was in&s;ufficient to &s;up|port her in tho&s;e extravagances to which &s;he had been, for a long time, habituated; and not feeling a di&s;po&s;ition to confine her|&s;elf within the limits of her income, while &s;he had the property of her decea&s;ed hu&s;|band in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;he had mo&s;tly ex|hau&s;ted it. The whole of the di&s;&s;ipated property was charged to the extravagance of the Colonel: This excited frequent di&s;|putes, and at length induced her to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures which produced &s;erious con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>Going privately to the judge, &s;he repre|&s;ented her &s;ituation, gave up her guard|ian&s;hip, urging the nece&s;&s;ity of a new guardian, being appointed, who &s;hould do immediate ju&s;tice to her child. Agreeably to her wi&s;hes, the Colonel was &s;ummoned to appear, and obliged to render a &s;tate|ment
<PB N="18" REF="025584_0017_0FCE03D0013A3968">
of the accounts, which proved him to be con&s;iderably deficient. But, as it was ever &s;uppo&s;ed, my aunt had &s;quander|ed a very great part.</P>
<P>The reduced &s;ituation of my uncle, put it out of his power to refund what had un|avoidably been applied to family u&s;e; and, di&s;gu&s;ted with the conduct of his wife, their hou&s;e became a continued &s;cene of jarrings, reflections, and di&s;putes. It was certainly proper that the child's property &s;hould be &s;ecured even at the hazard of a &s;eparation from her hu&s;band; but the&s;e difficulties &s;he ought to have fore&s;een.</P>
<P>The Colonel being deprived of the prop|erty of his ward, his next re&s;ource, for the &s;upport of his family, was from time to time, to di&s;po&s;e of &s;ome valuable piece of furniture. This added to my aunt's unea&s;i|ne&s;s&mdash;her complaints were ince&s;&s;ant. She con&s;idered the whole city as her friends, and without re&s;erve proclaimed abroad her do|me&s;tic troubles. The mo&s;t entire &s;tranger, as well as the particular friend, were alike entru&s;ted with her family circum&s;tances. Her hu&s;band &s;he repre&s;ented as a villain and a cheat; and by this unpardonable conduct,
<PB N="19" REF="025584_0018_0FCDE9DB16C0EF98">
&s;o injured his character with his fellow cit|izens, as to occa&s;ion a total lo&s;s of credit.</P>
<P>Thus unhappily was I &s;ituated for &s;everal months, when I re&s;olved to quit the city, and &s;eek, in the bo&s;om of a more retired life, that peace of which I was now depriv|ed.</P>
<P>I had written to my cou&s;in at Fort Pitt, and &s;o far adju&s;ted my own affairs, as to be able to di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf in the method mo&s;t agreeable to my wi&s;hes. I therefore took an early opportunity to acquaint my aunt with my intention, urg|ing it as nece&s;&s;ary to my health, that I &s;hould pa&s;s the approaching &s;ea&s;on in the country. In a few weeks, an eligible &s;itu|ation offering, I quitted, with avidity, this dwelling of murmur and complaint, re|plete with the mo&s;t &s;anguine ideas of future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Scarce had I &s;ipped from this &s;cene of promi&s;ed plea&s;ure, one plea&s;ing draught, before I was interrupted with her peace-de&s;troying letters, filled with her determi|nation of leaving her barbarous hu&s;|band; and, expre&s;&s;ive of her inclina|tion, to be accommodated with her niece.
<PB N="20" REF="025584_0019_0FCE03D0DD8966C0">
The&s;e letters, Maria, I never noticed, and in a few weeks became &s;o inured to her complaints, that I began to feel le&s;s affect|ed by them.</P>
<P>The human mind, my dear, in length of time, can become habituated to any &s;cene with which it is &s;urrounded. Thus the mo&s;t humane di&s;po&s;ition, by being conver|&s;ant with &s;ufferings which at fir&s;t made na|ture recoil, often delights in tho&s;e very things that, but a &s;hort time before, were &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to it. This ob&s;ervation demon&s;trates the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping the young mind remote from every &s;pecies of cruelty.</P>
<P>Perplexed, as I had been, with the imprudencies of my aunt, I rea&s;oned with my&s;elf upon the impropriety of ad|mitting her complaints to de&s;troy my promi&s;ed happine&s;s. Becau&s;e &s;he was cal|culated to be wretched, why &s;hould it cloud the dawn of my plea&s;ure? I &s;incerely re|gretted her &s;ituation; but re&s;olved that a mind which reveled in affliction, &s;hould not render me unju&s;t to my&s;elf. It is dif|ficult, Maria, to conquer our feelings; but
<PB N="21" REF="025584_0020_0FCE03D26170F190">
by the aid of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy, we may learn to &s;uppre&s;s an undue anxiety.</P>
<P>Viewing the unhappy &s;ituation of my aunt through its ju&s;t medium, I &s;hortly be|gan to con&s;ider her &s;ufferings as brought upon her&s;elf, by mo&s;t imprudent conduct, and therefore re&s;olved to check my feelings. Believing, that although the Deity has im|planted the delicate &s;en&s;ations of &s;ympathy deeply within our brea&s;ts, it is by no means his intention we &s;hould become mi&s;erable, when it is not in our power to remove the &s;uf|ferings of the wretched object. No, my dear, it is wi&s;ely ordered, as all human beings have their own misfortunes to &s;upport, they &s;hall not be capable of retaining the &s;ame acute &s;en&s;ations for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, as they experienced at fir&s;t &s;ight, and previous to their having offered &s;uch relief as their abil|ities would admit.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ing thought of having render|ed a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of mi&s;ery to a fellow mortal, is fragrant to the tender mind: Having done this, we return to our own particular concerns. Di&s;appoint|ment and misfortunes await us in the jour|ney of life. No &s;ituation, however eleva|ted,

<L>What are they? The mo&s;t happy (&s;trange to &s;ay!)</L>
<L>Convince me mo&s;t of human mi&s;ery."</L>
<P>The&s;e reflections it was my &s;tudy to &s;trengthen: The indulgence rendered me tranquil.</P>
<P>The village to which I had retired was upon the road to New-York; in it were &s;everal genteel families, &s;o that I was at no lo&s;s for &s;ociety, when di&s;po&s;ed to amu&s;e my&s;elf abroad. In the friendly circle, Maria, where conver&s;ation is enlighten|ed by the ob&s;ervations of our &s;uperi|ours in wi&s;dom and experience, much in|&s;truction may be derived: It unbends the mind, gives it a new reli&s;h for retirement, &s;oftens the manners and harmonizes the thoughts.</P>
<P>The young ladies who belong to Prince|ton, a great part of their time, re&s;ided in Philadelphia or New-York, for the benefit of their education, which deprived me of the opportunity of cultivating a friend&s;hip with tho&s;e of my own age. This circum&s;tance at fir&s;t was an alloy to my
<PB N="23" REF="025584_0022_0FCE03D6DBCC1E90">
&s;atisfaction; for we naturally &s;eek our a&s;|&s;ociates from among tho&s;e of our particu|lar &s;tanding in life. Here we expect to find corre&s;pondent inclinations, and from an agreement in di&s;po&s;itions, a friend&s;hip is gradually cemented, which &s;trengthens with advancing years; and, in the decline of life, is frequently productive of much real enjoyment.</P>
<P>Attached, however, to retirement, and never at a lo&s;s for amu&s;ement when I could obtain an entertaining book, I bani&s;hed this di&s;papointment.</P>
<P>The college being near, introduced many young gentlemen to my acquaint|ance. I was &s;eldom without a gallant, and had not been long in Princeton before I enli&s;ted &s;everal of the &s;tudents to the &s;tandard of love; or, perhaps, to &s;peak with more propriety, they were charmed with my fortune, which was now greatly increa&s;ed by the unfortunate circum&s;tance of my cou&s;in's &s;uppo&s;ed death; my uncle in this ca&s;e having left me &s;ole heir.</P>
<P>The painful intelligence of Major Wil|ly's defeat, while it threw a general gloom upon the citizens at large, doubly affected the
<PB N="24" REF="025584_0023_0FCE03D85C725170">
promi&s;ed happine&s;s of your Caroline, as it deprived me of the protection and advice of a much e&s;teemed friend. My cou&s;in being left in a &s;ituation &s;imilar to Major Willys, it was doubtful whether he was really dead, or had fallen into the hands of the Savages. Until &s;ome information could be obtained, we believed he had fal|len a &s;acrifice. No reflections, my dear Maria, could mitigate this &s;evere affliction. The idea that he might po&s;&s;ibly be a pri&s;|oner with the Indians, di&s;turbed my plea&s;|ures, and cruelly tortured my every enjoy|ment.</P>
<P>Followed with the clo&s;e&s;t attention from the &s;tudents, many &s;u&s;picions were excited in my brea&s;t, that my fortune was the mag|net which &s;o powerfully attracted their notice.</P>
<P>The influence of riches is great. Young and old pay adoration at the &s;hrine of wealth, but your Caroline has had &s;uffi|cient warning to guard her heart.&mdash;Matri|mony, Maria, is a &s;erious engagement.</P>

<P>TEASED, perplexed, &s;olicited by a group of fortune hunters, I can have no mo|ments my own. Poor Caroline, how does your money involve you in new difficulties! but I am fixed: To matrimony I will not be confined. A hu&s;band, what a name! is not my aunt a le&s;&s;on? I will leave the dull road of married life to fools. Thus thought your friend; but, Maria, thoughts change.</P>
<P>Walking was a recreation in which I u&s;ually indulged twice a day when the weather would permit. I had for &s;ome time accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to &s;troll into a de|lightful &s;pot, to which accident at fir&s;t led me. Here I was entertained by the little &s;ong&s;ters who charmed me with their mel|ody, and &s;hed a &s;uperior plea&s;ure upon my &s;oul. This I believed calculated for the habitation of &s;ome &s;ylvan deity. In it I generally pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal hours before break|fa&s;t, peru&s;ing &s;ome favourite author. While
<PB N="26" REF="025584_0025_0FCE03DCE3154AF0">
I remained in this retirement, I forgot the di&s;appointments which had veiled my im|agined felicity; I became lo&s;t in inexpre&s;&s;i|ble happine&s;s. The boughs of the friendly trees by nature formed a &s;hade around me; the&s;e were decorated with a variety of &s;pon|taneous vines, which entwined them&s;elves in various directions, and while they de|lighted the eye, wa&s;ted fragrance to the &s;mell. Upon the &s;tumps of a couple of de|cayed trees I had placed a board which &s;erved me as a &s;eat; every thing around encouraged contemplation.</P>
<P>One morning as I entered the bowry, I was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a miniature picture lying upon the bench; for I had flattered my&s;elf this delightful place was free from intruders. The picture I &s;eized with eagerne&s;s, viewed it and was enrap|tured: Oh! exclaimed I, is this the por|trait of a human being? Sincerely do I wi&s;h his heart!&mdash;Fear now di&s;turbed my reflec|tions. I was unea&s;y lea&s;t I &s;hould meet the owner in this place of &s;olitude, and aro&s;e to retire, but ca&s;ting my eyes around, ob|&s;erving the &s;ame peace and &s;erenity yet reigned in every &s;hrub, I ventured to de|lay

<P>Thunder&s;truck at the demand, I &s;at he&s;itating what to do, when I &s;uddenly heard a ru&s;tling among the bu&s;hes, and looking towards the noi&s;e, di&s;covered a young gentleman coming up to me. I was much alarmed. He ob&s;erved my a&s;toni&s;h|ment, and &s;tepping gracefully to me, &s;eized my hand: "My charming girl," &s;aid he, "your fears are groundle&s;s, give me leave to &s;eat you. The incident that has cau&s;|ed me to obtrude upon your retirement, which I have long ob&s;erved plea&s;ing to you, when you thought your&s;elf &s;e|cluded
<PB N="28" REF="025584_0027_0FCE03E13479B358">
from all ob&s;ervation, has been un|fortunate to me: Yes, Caroline, I am neither ignorant of your name, charac|ter or &s;ituation. The lines you wrote upon this bench were read by a young lady to whom I have long been engaged; for the lo&s;s of the picture &s;he is indeed incon&s;ola|ble; I mu&s;t therefore reque&s;t you will re|&s;tore it to me." I pau&s;ed. "You flatter me," &s;aid he, "by the reluctance with which you relinqui&s;h it." It was, indeed, Maria, a reque&s;t hard to reconcile with the feelings of my heart. The charming youth continued, "with rapture would I improve the pre&s;ent opportunity, to offer a heart devoted to you alone; but friends and parental wi&s;hes have long &s;ince deprived me of the choice:" Then falling on his knees, he drew out of his pocket a locket elegantly &s;et in gold. It repre&s;ented in hair-work, Hope, leaning upon her u&s;ual emblem, the anchor, and pointing with her other hand to a fountain, out of which two doves were drinking; on the back of it was in&s;cribed "<HI>To friend&s;hip.</HI>" "This is my own performance," &s;aid he, "will you honour me by your acceptance of it?" It
<PB N="29" REF="025584_0028_0FCE03E261EA4FE0">
was in&s;ufficient to purcha&s;e the picture then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but how could I re|fu&s;e his reque&s;t. I made no reply: He was &s;till kneeling, urging my acceptance. While in this attitude, who &s;hould appear, through a di&s;tant row of trees, but the en|viable, the happy Eliza! I was too well informed of her di&s;po&s;ition, not to tremble at her approach.</P>
<P>Upon my fir&s;t arrival at Princeton, I had been particularly cautioned not to form any connexion with this young lady, being the only child of parents who had ruined her in her education; and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing a naturally revengeful and jealous di&s;|po&s;ition, &s;he had made her&s;elf di&s;agreeable to all her acquaintance. Clarimont was &s;urpri&s;ed; he aro&s;e in much confu&s;ion, and walking towards her, &s;eized her hand, &s;aying, "I was pleading for the return of the picture upon which you are plea&s;ed to &s;et &s;o high a value." Until this moment I was ignorant who&s;e property I had in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and dreading her revengeful tem|per, ha&s;tened to her, pre&s;enting the pic|ture, I wi&s;h not to detain this, &s;aid I, but am happy in re&s;toring the valuable

trea&s;ure. Her countenance was &s;uffu&s;ed with re&s;entment: &s;he appeared to di&s;pute the &s;incerity of my expre&s;&s;ions. I imme|diately retired, re&s;olving never to revi&s;it a place which had been once &s;o plea&s;ing to me, lea&s;t it &s;hould appear with a de|&s;ign to meet Clarimont, and become fatal to either of us by the dreaded di&s;po&s;ition of Eliza. Having no wi&s;h to interrupt the romantic lovers, I re&s;olved to &s;eek &s;ome new &s;pot which &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, compen|&s;ate the lo&s;s of that to which I had been &s;o partial.</P>
<P>Ri&s;ing very early one morning I cro&s;&s;ed &s;ome adjacent fields, and pa&s;&s;ing towards a wood which promi&s;ed to &s;upply my wi&s;hes, &s;carce had I entered among the trees, when I was alarmed by a voice which appeared to be in very great di&s;tre&s;s. I &s;topped&mdash; nor can language expre&s;s my a&s;toni&s;hment. Remote from every object, my only re|&s;ource was to return to the road. With trembling &s;teps I gained a &s;ecret path; but had not proceeded far, before the report of of a pi&s;tol gave fre&s;h agitation to my di&s;|turbed mind. Almo&s;t di&s;tracted with fright, I had &s;carce &s;trength to gain the
<PB N="31" REF="025584_0030_0FCE03E6E2229DF0">
road, when I &s;eated my&s;elf, to recover, if po&s;&s;ible, my a&s;toni&s;hed &s;en&s;es. I had been here but a few minutes, before an amazing du&s;t aro&s;e in columns at a little di&s;tance. This was occa&s;ioned by a detachment of new levies marching to the We&s;tern Country. As they ap|proached, every fearful idea of a female mind ru&s;hing into view, your Caroline fainted. When I came to my&s;elf, I found I was in the arms of an officer, who by ev|ery tender and polite attention, endeavour|ed to calm my mind. He urged to know what had thus affected me. I was unable to reply, and could expre&s;s no more than <HI>the pi&s;tol&mdash;the woods</HI>&mdash;pointing in con&s;tern|ation to the &s;pot. A party was in&s;tantly detached to &s;earch for the cau&s;e of my di&s;|tre&s;s, who &s;oon, returned with the account of having found a young man weltering in his blood, lifele&s;s upon the ground. By this time I had &s;o far recovered as to be able to walk; and &s;upporting my&s;elf upon the arm of the officer, &s;oon reached my lodg|ings.</P>
<P>This event cau&s;ed a general alarm thro'|out the village, and in a few hours the
<PB N="32" REF="025584_0031_0FCE03E81D11B620">
painful intelligence reached me, that Clarimont, the lover of Eliza, had fal|len by his own hands. The agitation of my mind prevented that attention to my benefactor which his politene&s;s mer|ited. I did not permit him to leave me without a promi&s;e of calling upon me, &s;hould an opportunity pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>At this period, little did I expect, this incident would de&s;troy my future happine&s;s. Providence has wi&s;ely con|cealed tho&s;e events which are de&s;tined to overtake us in the walks of life&punc; I had not been in company with the unfor|tunate youth, &s;ince the morning we met in the arbour, having been particularly cau|tious not to fall in his way. To what induc|ed him to take this &s;tep I was a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>A jury was &s;ummoned, who having &s;at upon the body, brought in their verdict <HI>in&s;ane.</HI> The connexions of Eliza now took charge of the corp&s;e. They prepared to perform the la&s;t office to the decea&s;ed; as Clarimont belonged to Virginia, and had been &s;ent to this village for his educa|tion. A few days after his interment, I received the following billet from Eliza:

<P>How have you involved me in wretch|edne&s;s by encouraging the private addre&s;&s;es of a man long engaged to another. Pre|tend not to vindicate your&s;elf. I have been a witne&s;s of your treachery. Remember your confu&s;ion when we unexpectedly met in the arbour. I then di&s;covered the &s;ent|iments of your heart.</P>
<P>Blinded by attachment for Clarimont, I would not &s;uffer an idea of his duplicity to impre&s;s my mind until the night previous to the &s;uicide, when I accidentally di&s;cov|ered your hated picture hanging around his neck. This memento of his ba&s;ene&s;s I tore from him: It is now in my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, where it &s;hall for ever remain an in|dubitable evidence of your treachery and deceit; and you may be a&s;&s;ured the ven|geance of Eliza &s;hall ever follow Caroline.</P>
<P>My picture! Maria&mdash;heaven only knows how Clarimont obtained it. He was indeed attached to his pencil, and po&s;|&s;ibly might have taken my likene&s;s, as I had been &s;itting in the arbour. I was, however, innocent, and addre&s;&s;ed the fol|lowing reply:

<P>This affair having put a period to my enjoyments in this place, I was urged by my friends to ab&s;ent my&s;elf for &s;ome time from the immediate eye of Eliza, who had become &s;trongly prejudiced again&s;t me, and frequently expre&s;&s;ed her implacable re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Unea&s;y at continuing in the neighbour|hood of Eliza, while &s;he remained thus bitter again&s;t me, and having been repeat|edly &s;olicited to vi&s;it New-York, I took a &s;eat in the &s;tage to that city. Upon my arrival I was received with every mark of friend&s;hip by Lucretia Barton, a young lady for whom I had early imbibed a par|ticular e&s;teem. She was the only child of Mr. Thomas Barton, a re&s;pectable merch|ant
<PB N="35" REF="025584_0034_0FCE03EE1D96B118">
in New-York; and having been deprived of her mother in infancy, had pa&s;&s;ed much of her time at a boarding &s;chool in Phila|delphia, where our friend&s;hip commenced. By the &s;prightly &s;ociety of this dear girl, the gloom which involved my mind, grad|ually di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P>From the ob&s;ervations I had made re|&s;pecting the unhappy conduct of my aunt, I had long e&s;tabli&s;hed it a maxim of pru|dence, and a dictate of rea&s;on, to make as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible the various incidents which occur in the journey of life. To Clari|mont, I confe&s;s, I was partial: In his happine&s;s was my heart intere&s;ted; but the &s;u&s;picions which were excited in the brea&s;t of Eliza were as oppo&s;ed to my in|nocence as they were de&s;tructive of my peace.</P>
<P>The parties in which I was frequently engaged tended to era&s;e from recollection the dull &s;cenes of Princeton. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ureable events often ab&s;orbs the mind, and we forget, when &s;urrounded with di&s;&s;ipation and amu&s;ement, the pain|ful circum&s;tances which had previou&s;ly in|vaded

our happine&s;s: Thus is human ex|i&s;tence rendered more tolerable.</P>
<P>During my vi&s;it in this city I received &s;everal letters from my repining aunt: The&s;e afforded Lucretia and my&s;elf much amu&s;ement. They informed me &s;he had left her inhuman hu&s;band, and taken a &s;mall hou&s;e at Trenton, where &s;he anticipa|ted the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing me and my friend. Lucretia, plea&s;ed with the invitation, con|&s;ented to accompany me. We according|ly engaged a &s;eat in the &s;tage, and were &s;afely landed at the door of my aunt No|ble, who, ever attached to company, gave us a warm reception. Civility and cu&s;tom obliged us to enquire after her health. One enquiry, Maria, was a &s;ufficient opening for the relation of all her mental and bod|ily &s;ufferings. She &s;eized the hand of Lu|cretia and began the unintere&s;ting recital. When &s;he came to the de&s;cription of her di&s;orders, it was indeed difficult to refrain from &s;miling. "A numbne&s;s of the brain, an extreme pre&s;&s;ure upon the eyes, and a con&s;tant irritation of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, I apprehend in&s;anity mu&s;t finally en|&s;ue." Conver&s;ing upon this &s;ubject brought

on all her <HI>&s;pa&s;ms, contractions,</HI> &amp;c. The doctor was called; he entered the room: his &s;addle bags containing his &s;pecific med|icine, variou&s;ly modified, hung upon his arm. This valuable compo&s;ition, Maria, in the opinion of this &s;on of E&s;culapius, was a <HI>&s;ummum bonum</HI>; it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the virtues of the <HI>materia medica.</HI> Said Lu|cretia, a&s;ide, will it cure a weak head? We handed him a chair; he &s;eated him&s;elf by my aunt, and with great tenderne&s;s, &s;olicited her to be compo&s;ed. "I am afraid of convul&s;ions, doctor." "Don't be alarm|ed, madam," he replied; "it is the extreme ten&s;ion upon &s;ome of the fine ve&s;&s;els which produces this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing taught|ne&s;s; you want &s;ome invigorating applica|tion; nothing is a greater &s;timulus than camphire; a few drops of this valuable drug, will &s;hortly relieve you; the virtues of this incomparable gum, madam, are un|known to the city doctors. It may be u&s;ed to inexpre&s;&s;ible advantage in every di&s;or|der, to which we are incident. In fevers its efficacy cannot be denied by its peculiar diaphoretic quality; it rapidly throws off ob&s;tructions; it &s;urpri&s;ingly heals the in|flammation

of the bowels and &s;tomach in con&s;umptive habits, and brings on the ne|ce&s;&s;ary expectoration for the relief of the lungs; it forcibly expels all internal im|pediments, acting upon the nerves as opium upon the &s;en&s;es; lulls their agitation, and renders the patient tranquil and compo&s;ed. Nor is it le&s;s beneficial in all external ap|plications; even mortifications may be &s;topt by its peculiar power." During his animadver&s;ions upon the efficacy of cam|phire, he &s;everal times repeated the do&s;e, which was admini&s;tered in a cordial. My aunt began to be in better &s;pirits. The doctor, after having often reminded us of the ignorance of the city phy&s;icians, withdrew.</P>
<P>This was a diverting &s;cene. I fear, Maria, as you are unacquainted with this aunt of mine, you will begin to think me de&s;titute of tho&s;e tender &s;en&s;ations which beautify humanity. If the&s;e are your ideas you derogate from your friend, who&s;e &s;oul is alive to &s;ympathy, and in who&s;e eye frequently &s;parkles the con|genial tear. My aunt is not without my pity; but the troubles &s;he experiences are brought upon her by a weak mind, which
<PB N="39" REF="025584_0038_0FCE03F4DBD778D0">
&s;he never has taken pains to correct, and an entire ignorance of human nature. The&s;e &s;ources alone would be &s;ufficient to involve her in continual difficulties, had not an ungovernable temper &s;ealed her mi&s;ery. Philo&s;ophers &s;ay, all the virtues are in conjunction; is this the ca&s;e, my aunt Noble is &s;trikingly deficient; &s;ince prudence, which is fir&s;t upon the li&s;t, nev|er had the mo&s;t remote connexion with any part of her conduct. The moral vir|tues only execute what prudence pre&s;cribes.</P>
<P>Had &s;he taken the &s;teps previous to her late marriage which &s;he has &s;ince been com|pelled to adopt, tho&s;e great cau&s;es of her unhappine&s;s had been impeded. Nor could this precaution in any degree evince a want of confidence in Mr. Noble; &s;he would then have experienced a &s;atisfaction in her own reflections which would have rendered her inexpre&s;&s;ibly happy.</P>
<P>Nothing is more luxuriant to a thinking mind than &s;elf approbation: It is a &s;un which di&s;pels the clouds of &s;olicitude and anxiety. Homer tells us of an herb which the ancients called <HI>Nepenthe</HI>; that being made an ingredient in their fea&s;ts, bani&s;hed

&s;orrow from their minds. I wi&s;h we could obtain this valuable plant for my aunt: It would be a plea&s;ing &s;ub&s;titute for cards; for, as u&s;ual, the tea tray is no &s;ooner removed, than the apparatus for play is introduced.</P>
<P>We had been here but a few days, when Lucretia began to complain that nervous company di&s;agreed with her ta&s;te. Few hours could be agreeable under my aunt's roof. She ever corroded the plea&s;ures of the table with a recital of her ill treatment and indi&s;po&s;ition: Her uncommon dif|ficulties were the theme of conver&s;ation; her family troubles the topic at all times and places. If checked for indulging a gloomy di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he declared her di&s;tre&s;s involuntary and unavoidable. Every plea&s;|ing idea for&s;ook her. Her hours were de|voted to tears, and the mo&s;t bitter invectives again&s;t her cruel hu&s;band.</P>

<P>IN addition to the failings I have already de&s;cribed, my aunt Noble po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the painful faculty of anticipating di&s;tre&s;&s;ing events; &s;o that we were not only entertain|tained with her per&s;onal difficulties, but amu&s;ed with &s;ome dreadful misfortune which was continually about to befal her darling children. The gloomy premoni|tions of her mind deprived us of all enjoy|ment. We certainly have no occa&s;ion to &s;eek the evils of life, they will ever obtrude them&s;elves upon us. To add to her afflic|tion, &s;he was continually tormented with dreams which foreboded &s;ome &s;ad event, yet &s;he never acknowledged to have &s;lept. Why madam, &s;aid I, will you not wait until the trouble comes, it is &s;urely &s;ufficient to feel it when it has overtaken you; by indulging this di&s;po&s;ition, you &s;uffer in imagination what may never become real, and thus accumulate di&s;tre&s;s. It is the duty of rational beings to exert the powers
<PB N="42" REF="025584_0041_0FCE03FA201C3AE8">
of the mind, and to render them&s;elves as comfortable and happy as the mutability of human life will admit. But my aunt was as great a &s;tranger to ethics as to the cardi|nal virtues. Tired with a continued repe|tition of grievances and complaints, I dread|ed her company. The&s;e, however, would have affected me but little, had &s;he not in|truded upon me, when I retired to my chamber, and thus di&s;turbed my moments of reflection.</P>
<P>Mr. Addi&s;on ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, "That we &s;hould not trouble our friends with rela|tions which mu&s;t oblige them to real or feigned affliction. Cares, di&s;tre&s;&s;es, di&s;ea&s;es, unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, and di&s;likes of our own, are by no means to be obtruded upon them. We &s;hould not bring them little &s;orrows, which do not belong to them. Fortune gives us di&s;appointments &s;ufficient; nature is at|tended with infirmities enough, without our adding to the unhappy &s;ide of our ac|count by &s;pleen or ill humour."</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician of my aunt was invaria|bly called, three or four times a week, to re|new his pre&s;criptions of camphire, which he admini&s;tered in various ways; &s;ometimes
<PB N="43" REF="025584_0042_0FCE03FD4590A308">
in powder to "brace the debility of her delicate frame;" at others in drops, "to dif|fu&s;e it&s;elf into the little ve&s;&s;els and cau&s;e a proper animation of the parts. The head, madam, abounds with an infinite number of fine ve&s;&s;els, &s;ome of which are too crowd|ed with blood, while others are flabby and want to be wound up: Taking plentifully of the&s;e, and keeping your&s;elf compo&s;ed, will &s;oon relieve you. Camphire is exce&s;|&s;ively diffu&s;ive, invigorating and pungent."</P>
<P>There were no circum&s;tances which oc|curred while we were at this village, more replete with diver&s;ion to Lucretia and my|&s;elf than the doctor's vi&s;its. In the city they are &s;hort; but a country phy&s;ician brings in his &s;addle-bags, takes off his great-coat and hat, and is &s;eated for an hour or two: It is a fortunate circum&s;tance their demands are not in proportion to the length of their vi&s;its. I do not pretend to &s;ay all my aunt's di&s;orders were imaginary, but am confident an attention to exerci&s;e and diet, would make her life much more comforta|ble. I can &s;carcely believe the complaints of tho&s;e, who pay no attention to the regu|lation of their lives; but at the expen&s;e of
<PB N="44" REF="025584_0043_0FCE03FE9A58B488">
health, that greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing mortals can en|joy, gratify their mo&s;t vitiated appetites; it is unrea&s;onable to expect that a delicate and infirm habit &s;hould not &s;everely &s;uffer from &s;uch indulgences; the&s;e imprudences mu&s;t render futile the attentions of the phy&s;ician, and defeat the applications of the mo&s;t learned practitioner.</P>
<P>Lucretia wi&s;hes to vi&s;it Philadelphia: She is unea&s;y le&s;t &s;he &s;hould become con|taminated, and frequently ob&s;erves, there is no advantage to be derived from pa&s;&s;ing our time with tho&s;e gloomy minds which revel in affliction, and who&s;e mo&s;t luxuri|ous repa&s;t appears to be the bitter of life.</P>
<P>Did not the circle of our own acquaint|ance pre&s;ent to knowledge &s;imilar characters with that of my aunt Noble, it would be difficult to realize their exi&s;tence. That be|ings endowed with the powers of rational reflection, who are at liberty to dwell upon any &s;ubject, &s;hould &s;elect from that variety which might employ their thoughts, di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing premonitions, and indulge the an|ticipation of troubles which may never ex|i&s;t, evinces an unpardonable vacancy of mind which mu&s;t &s;tigmatize their folly, and
<PB N="45" REF="025584_0044_0FCE04001DEF19E8">
render them contemptible and little in the opinion of tho&s;e who are &s;o unfortunate as to have any intercour&s;e with them. It cannot therefore &s;urpri&s;e you that Lucre|tia is de&s;irous to leave this place. For my own part, I am &s;ick of hearing a worn out &s;tory related to every new face which appears. Di&s;gu&s;ted with her company, I confine my&s;elf to my chamber; even here, as before ob&s;erved, I am interrupted: It is impo&s;&s;ible to indulge my own ideas. She is di&s;plea&s;ed that I thus &s;eclude my&s;elf. "It is evident I &s;light her &s;ociety." She complains much to Lucretia. "Her niece, &s;he believes, will turn her brain with reading. For her part &s;he cannot imagine what bu&s;ine&s;s women have with books, unle&s;s it is now and then an entertaining novel. She never knew one who after all her &s;tudy ever became a Locke or a Newton. There are certain do|me&s;tic employments for females beyond which they have no right to deviate. Science belongs not to them: Let them &s;tudy to grace a table, become conver&s;ant in dome&s;tic concerns, and their minds are &s;ufficiently improved. But Caroline, to be &s;ure, mu&s;t be turning over the leaves of

&s;ome old hi&s;tory. How &s;he can amu&s;e her|&s;elf with &s;uch dry narrations I cannot tell."</P>
<P>That &s;uch remarks &s;hould fall from a woman, who has no idea of the real enjoy|ment which is derived from &s;o rational an indulgence, is by no means &s;urpri&s;ing. Could &s;he reli&s;h this mode of pa&s;&s;ing her lei&s;ure moments, the vacuum &s;he now ex|periences, would vani&s;h; a country life would then be more con&s;onant with her feelings.</P>
<P>If, with the "mind's eye," &s;he had a ta&s;te to travel through di&s;tant kingdoms and take a retro&s;pective view of pa&s;t events, &s;he might nouri&s;h that fondne&s;s for variety, &s;o pre|dominant with human nature, and in the indulgence of this di&s;po&s;ition be happy. Sincerely do I wi&s;h her &s;ingular in the&s;e degrading &s;entiments; then &s;hould we &s;hine more con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>The divine Creator has made no differ|ence between the &s;ouls of the &s;exes, but giv|en to each, &s;imilar powers of improvement. Education alone con&s;titutes the &s;uperi|ority. It hath hitherto been our mi&s;fortune to be greatly neglected, while &s;chools and colleges have been in&s;tituted, and every po&s;|&s;ible

Early are they in&s;tructed in &s;uch &s;tudies as will be mo&s;t beneficial to them; and from infancy habitu|ated to arrange their ideas, their whole time is devoted to reflection. Can it be wondered that they who have made it the bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives, to become ma&s;ters of rea&s;oning, &s;hould excel us who have been deprived of tho&s;e advantages. All the education thought nece&s;&s;ary for our &s;ex until within a few years, has been &s;imple reading and writing. Thus neglected we mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a&s;toni&s;hing geniu&s;es to ri&s;e &s;uperior to the impediments with which we have been &s;urrounded; yet we &s;ometimes meet with tho&s;e who have &s;trength to &s;oar above the&s;e difficulties and reflect a lu&s;tre upon female abilities.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of education, there appears to be a very great error. Intro|ducing young ladies upon the &s;tage to &s;peak in public, tends to give them a con|fidence which does not belong to a female; and &s;o far from encouraging tho&s;e feelings nature has implanted, lulls them into a dangerous apathy, and by repetition, de|&s;troys that ea&s;y, natural delicacy which &s;hould ever adorn their characters.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="025584_0047_0FCE04061B4D6CF8">A certain degree of a&s;&s;urance is nece&s;&s;ary for the gentlemen; but a lady is mo&s;t plea&s;ingly de&s;ignated by a mode&s;t re&s;erve. It is the mo&s;t attractive charm &s;he can po&s;|&s;e&s;s. True mode&s;ty avoids the eye of pub|lic admiration. Nature has connected in our compo&s;ition &s;uch a keenne&s;s of &s;en&s;i|bility, that we are pained when expo&s;ed to public ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>A young lady, early accu&s;tomed to gen|teel company, will ever acquire &s;ufficient confidence for private life. It is nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;truct tho&s;e only who are de&s;igned for the theatre, to &s;peak before crouded audi|ences.</P>

<P>ATTACHED to riding on hor&s;e|back, Lucretia and my&s;elf make frequent excur&s;ions. In one of the&s;e rambles, in which by nece&s;&s;ity we were unattended, for a country life &s;eldom affords gallants, an incident took place which determined us in future to be more cautious. Yet &s;uch is the con&s;truction of the human mind, that fear mu&s;t be &s;trongly impre&s;t not to wear off by time. In&s;tead of riding in the morning as had been our u&s;ual practice, we concluded to go in the afternoon, wi&s;hing to take a road, which in the morning, was rendered di&s;agreeable by giving us the &s;un in our faces. The day was inviting, we were plea&s;ed with the pro&s;pect around, and unmindful of our di&s;tance from home. En|gaged in conver&s;ation, the &s;un had &s;et before we had any idea of its retiring. An improving companion is an in&s;tructing thief, which in&s;en&s;ibly &s;teals away the hours. It was, however, prudent for us to ha&s;ten
<PB N="50" REF="025584_0049_0FCE0409E0162C20">
into the main road, where we naturally &s;uppo&s;ed our&s;elves more &s;ecure. Ju&s;t as we had entered the po&s;t road, we were fa|miliarly addre&s;&s;ed by a per&s;on on hor&s;e-back, who appeared di&s;po&s;ed to accompany us. He begged to know how far we were going. We a&s;&s;ured him we were but a &s;hort di&s;tance from home and under no ap|prehen&s;ions. Notwith&s;tanding this, he in|&s;i&s;ted upon accompanying us. We had gone but a little way before we made an addition to our party. A per&s;on who ap|peared well acquainted with our gallant rode up, and addre&s;&s;ed him in a &s;tyle which alarmed us. Being upon the great road we flattered our&s;elves we &s;hould &s;oon meet with &s;ome traveller who would relieve us. Lucretia and my&s;elf rode as near as po&s;&s;ible to each other. Our bo&s;oms beat with anx|iety. Our gallants &s;oon &s;eparated, and rode one upon each &s;ide of us. Thus confined between them, judge of our feel|ings. Ju&s;t as we came to a retired path they propo&s;ed our turning into it; and finding we would not con&s;ent, they &s;eized, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, the bridles of both our hor&s;es, and with an oath declared we &s;hould
<PB N="51" REF="025584_0050_0FCE040B5A93FC50">
do as they &s;aid. I &s;hudder when I recol|lect the providential means of our e&s;cape. At this moment, encouraged by the &s;ound of hor&s;es' feet we &s;creamed for help. The villains were alarmed, and letting go their hold, rode off with precipitation. We were immediately overtaken by a gentle|man on his journey to New-York. He inquired the cau&s;e of our fears; very politely attended us to the door of my aunt, and would now have taken leave, but we urged him to alight; and under&s;tanding he intended putting up at the next inn, in&s;i&s;ted on his taking a bed, which he accepted. Before he left us he impre&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of our being attended by &s;ome gentleman in our future excur&s;ions, and promi&s;ed to call upon us on his return from New-York, if we had left Trenton, to gratify us with a vi&s;it in Philadelphia. This incident fre&s;h in our minds made us cautious of ven|turing abroad; it was &s;everal weeks before we dared to lo&s;e &s;ight of the hou&s;e.</P>

<P>A FEW days after I wrote you la&s;t, as Lucretia and my&s;elf were &s;trolling upon the banks of a little &s;tream, which meander|ed at the foot of a hill but a &s;hort di&s;tance from the hou&s;e of my aunt, we were alarmed by voices which appeared to be di&s;tant; the water only conveying the &s;ound. This, it is probable, would not have produced any unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations in our minds, but for the incident before related. The danger we had lately e&s;caped ru&s;hed full upon us; and without delay we turned towards the path, re&s;olved to reach the road as quick as po&s;&s;ible. This we &s;carce had time to effect, when looking behind, we ob&s;erved a per&s;on in the habit of a woman gaining fa&s;t upon us. The oddity of her dre&s;s and the peculiarity of her appearance in&s;tantly made us &s;u&s;pect it to be a man. Su&s;picion gave wings to our feet and we &s;oon fell in with &s;ome hone&s;t farmers, under who&s;e e&s;cort we once more &s;afely entered
<PB N="53" REF="025584_0052_0FCE040FDC6BF0A0">
our own doors. It was now judged pru|dent we &s;hould immediately leave Trenton, as &s;everal circum&s;tances corroborated to convince us a plan was forming again&s;t me by Eliza. We accordingly took &s;eats in the &s;tage for Philadelphia.</P>
<P>It was with plea&s;ure we quitted Trenton, not becau&s;e the charms of a rural life had lo&s;t their reli&s;h: No, Maria; &s;ecluded from the bu&s;y &s;cenes of the metropolis, we are free from many cares which extend a fever|i&s;h anxiety, while &s;urrounded with di&s;&s;ipa|tion, which too often de&s;troys reflection and embitters life. But it is painful to be con|fined to one di&s;tre&s;&s;ing theme. Human life is &s;ufficiently crowded with per&s;onal troubles: To &s;upport them with fortitude, &s;hould be the endeavour of every rational mind.</P>
<P>Encompa&s;&s;ed by innumerable cares and anxieties, it was never intended we &s;hould take any further &s;hare in the troubles of tho&s;e around, than was &s;ufficient, if in our power to relieve their di&s;tre&s;s. It certainly would be a great addition to the mi&s;eries of life, &s;hould we &s;uffer our&s;elves to be made wretched by every de&s;ponding gloomy di&s;|po&s;ition,
<PB N="54" REF="025584_0053_0FCE041177CD2BE8">
our pity is indeed excited, we la|ment their weakne&s;s, and urge the nece&s;&s;ity of fortitude. Such is the natural imbecility of the human mind, it confines us to the im|mediate &s;cenes in which we are engaged; and as new objects pre&s;ent, the pa&s;t is in a degree era&s;ed from recollection. This in|deed is wi&s;ely ordered.</P>
<P>In this city we have taken lodgings at a widow Lea&s;on's. She is polite and agreea|ble; but as no one is without their particular characteri&s;tic, we cannot expect our land|lady to be an exception. Mrs. Lea&s;on has one child, ble&s;&s;ed with good natural abili|ties, and educated by a le&s;s indulgent parent, &s;he might have &s;hone in a dome&s;tic charac|ter; but when the idea is in&s;tilled in the youthful mind, that it is to be indulged in all its wi&s;hes, let the di&s;po&s;ition be ever &s;o plea&s;ing, the &s;oil is contaminated, and in|&s;tead of producing a grateful vegetation, is over-run with a &s;pontaneous exuberance of pride, which choaks every fragrant &s;prout.</P>
<P>Laura by this too indulgent mother, is even prevented from taking the nece&s;&s;ary exerci&s;e which the con&s;titution requires. It would be natural to &s;uppo&s;e, from the line
<PB N="55" REF="025584_0054_0FCE0413F485E470">
of life which Providence has allotted Mrs. Lea&s;on, &s;he would have habituated her daughter to early attentions in the family. Nothing can better qualify a young lady, who expects one day to become the mi&s;tre&s;s of a family, than a proper re&s;pect to the economy and regulations in dome&s;tic con|cerns. I believe it to be a duty parents owe their children, early to in&s;truct them in &s;uch &s;cenes as will be nece&s;&s;ary to future happine&s;s; and let my fortune be ever &s;o independent, I am re&s;olved, &s;hould I ever commence the mother, early to accu&s;tom my daughters daily to devote a few hours to dome&s;tic matters; this will never render them le&s;s re&s;pected abroad.</P>
<P>Do not mi&s;take me. I have no wi&s;h to confine female education to dome&s;tic du|ties. No, Maria; the greate&s;t &s;ource of our happine&s;s is an enlightened mind. It is a cau&s;e of regret that more attention is not paid to our education. If the mind is a barren wa&s;te, of what avail are the beauties of the mo&s;t lovely face, the elegance of the mo&s;t enchanting &s;hape, the grace of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed per&s;on; the impercepti|ble hand of time will deprive them of eve|ry
<PB N="56" REF="025584_0055_0FCE04151C7BEA78">
external charm, and eclip&s;e the lu&s;tre of the mo&s;t penetrating eye. But the mind, that immortal part, can never fade. If properly cultivated, it will unfold new beauties, and by a continual progre&s;s in virtue and happine&s;s, be finally prepared for &s;uperior enjoyments above; while a trifling di&s;&s;ipated di&s;po&s;ition can never be attuned to tho&s;e delightful employ|ments which engage &s;o many departed &s;aints in heaven.</P>
<P>Laura is fond of reading, and by having free acce&s;s to the city library, is in a &s;itua|tion to indulge &s;o laudable an attachment; but like too many of her &s;ex, &s;he neglects tho&s;e writings which would be beneficial and in&s;tructive, and with avidity &s;eizes every romantic volume; thus her ta&s;te be|comes poi&s;oned. I wi&s;h not too &s;everely to condemn this kind of writing, but only to impre&s;s the idea that the choice &s;hould be directed by judgment. "The &s;tyle in which they are frequently dre&s;&s;ed capti|vates the mind, and conveys poi&s;on to the youthful fancy; although their influence is imperceptible, it is not the le&s;s &s;ure. The pa&s;&s;ions too often become inflamed, and
<PB N="57" REF="025584_0056_0FCE04169ABE2548">
by a repetition of love adventures, the pure ideas become injured, and we feel a &s;ecret wi&s;h to imitate &s;cenes with which we are thus delighted. They have ruined the minds of many, by in&s;tilling into them principlies of duplicity and intrigue, and thus prepared them for &s;imilar violations of morality and virtue."</P>
<P>I have repeatedly expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urpri&s;e at Laura's ta&s;te. She in return is as much a&s;toni&s;hed that any can be plea&s;ed with the dry, in&s;ipid page of hi&s;tory. Are you fond of love adventures, I replied, you will of|ten meet with them in hi&s;tory. An illicit love occa&s;ioned the de&s;truction of the fine&s;t city in A&s;ia. It cau&s;ed Anthony to for|&s;ake Octavia, and revel in the arms of the celebrated Cleopatra.</P>
<P>By this delightful &s;tudy you will be taught the fatal effects of jealou&s;y and am|bition. At one period you will &s;ee the world involved in the greate&s;t ignorance and barbari&s;m; at another, ri&s;ing by civil|ization and refinement, decorated in all the charms of politene&s;s and learning: But it is impo&s;&s;ible to gain her attention.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="025584_0057_0FCE04196714B708">Mrs. Lea&s;on's error, in her daughter's education, is greatly to be lamented. Hab|its contracted in early life are often unal|terable: Great care is therefore requi&s;ite that none &s;hould be formed but &s;uch as will e&s;tabli&s;h virtuous and &s;olid &s;atisfaction: Then would our days dawn amid&s;t the &s;miles of an approving con&s;cience, and clo&s;e with &s;uperlative plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A &s;triking trait in the character of our landlady is a &s;ympathy of &s;oul: She is ev|er ready to mitigate the &s;ufferings of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and the congenial tear, which is infinitely more valuable than the diadem of Cae&s;ar, often trembles in her eye and di&s;|covers the gentlene&s;s of her heart: This ca&s;ts a veil over many of her failings, while others are too unpardonable to be over|looked&punc;</P>
<P>Her &s;trong propen&s;ity to di&s;cover the &s;ecrets of tho&s;e families in which &s;he vi&s;its, certainly evinces a little mind: To this is added a great fondne&s;s for match-making. Several matches formed by her have prov|ed unhappy: This is not &s;urpri&s;ing. Con|nexions, which re&s;ult from motives of convenience or intere&s;t, either terminate in
<PB N="59" REF="025584_0058_0FCE041A78CE34B0">
wretchedne&s;s, or are embittered with many real evils.</P>
<P>Marriages, formed upon the idea of pro|tection or fortune, although the corruption of the pre&s;ent age may &s;tyle them marriages of rea&s;on, in my view, are but legal pro&s;ti|tutions: Nor can any happine&s;s be expected but from equality of years, &s;imilarity of ta&s;te and mutual e&s;teem; the&s;e indeed promi&s;e a la&s;ting &s;atisfaction. Lucretia and my&s;elf have had &s;everal hu&s;bands pro|po&s;ed for us, but we are re&s;olved to choo&s;e for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Laura is &s;o di&s;obliging to the gentlemen who board with her mamma, that &s;he has gained their general di&s;e&s;teem. She has e&s;tabli&s;hed it as a maxim, if &s;he obliges them by doing any little thing, they will learn to expect it. Upon this princi|ple &s;he is determined not to indulge them; and flinging back her head with an air, &s;ays, "It is not her place, and to be &s;ure &s;he &s;hall not do it." A poor conduct for a child to adopt, who&s;e mother is de|pendant.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lea&s;on has been a long while en|deavoring to unite Laura and one of her
<PB N="60" REF="025584_0059_0FCE041BEBE8CC88">
boarders, but is not likely to &s;ucceed. Sincerely do I wi&s;h the nece&s;&s;ity of econo|my in dome&s;tic concerns may yet be im|pre&s;t upon the mind of Laura. Few Amer|ican fortunes can &s;upport a woman who is above the calls of her family. Servants, however faithful, &s;eldom con&s;ider the in|tere&s;ts of their employers with that atten|tion they would their own; but if unob|&s;erved, often bring affluence to poverty. The care of the mi&s;tre&s;s is therefore nece&s;|&s;ary to prevent prodigality and ruin.</P>

<P>AT tho&s;e moments, my dear Ma|ria, when the recollection of pa&s;t events would de&s;troy pre&s;ent plea&s;ures, I have re|cour&s;e to the con&s;olatory language of your friendly letters. The&s;e are replete with a balm which ever &s;ooths the &s;everity of my &s;ufferings; nor is there a more plea&s;ing reflection ari&s;ing in the bo&s;om of Caro|line, than that Maria is her friend. Let me &s;olicit the continuance of your allevia|ting letters.</P>
<P>By a few lines, ju&s;t received from my aunt, I am informed of an attempt of &s;ome per&s;ons to enter her hou&s;e. Fortunately &s;he was at this period afflicted with &s;ome of her nervous complaints, which deprived her of &s;leep, and hearing them as they came into the yard, &s;he called the &s;ervants, by which circum&s;tance they were alarmed and made off. The next morning &s;he received the following billet.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="025584_0061_0FCE041FB0A09008">"Madam,</P>
<P>"There is a plan again&s;t your niece, which, if &s;he continues in Trenton, with|out doubt will be put in execution. I am not at liberty to make my&s;elf known, but &s;olicit the young lady to be upon her guard."</P>
<P>This information will prevent the grati|fication of many innocent amu&s;ements even in this city; for if Eliza is yet determined to follow me with her re&s;entment, &s;he can certainly find tho&s;e in this metropolis cal|culated for the execution of her plans.</P>
<P>The gentleman to whom we were in|debted for our &s;afety at Trenton, has call|ed upon us, and if I am not deceived, he di&s;covers a partiality for Lucretia. Mrs. Lea&s;on is acquainted with him, and has given us his character, embelli&s;hing it with many a fanciful relation. His attention appears plea&s;ing to my friend. Mi&s;s Lea|&s;on's behaviour has occa&s;ioned her mamma the lo&s;s of &s;ome of her be&s;t boarders. Up|on our good landlady's account, I &s;incerely regret it; though &s;he alone is to blame for not in&s;tilling into the mind of her daughter, early principles of propriety.
<PB N="63" REF="025584_0062_0FCE042307687430">
The fir&s;t ideas impre&s;t upon the youthful fancy, lay the foundation for their future reputation in life: It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary the gentle hand of in&s;truction &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t the expanding judgment. Laura is not without her good qualities; but the&s;e are di&s;coloured by the medium through which they pa&s;s. From the cradle, habituated to indulgence, &s;he cannot &s;upport the mo&s;t trivial di&s;appointment. This di&s;po&s;ition is of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to render her wretched; for di&s;appointments will intrude upon us, notwith&s;tanding our whole attention is en|gaged to repel them; and no &s;ooner do we appear on the theatre of life, than we are involved in anxieties.</P>
<P>My aunt, I am told, is endeavouring to obtain the influence of her friends, to pre|pare the way for her return to a hu&s;band, whom &s;he has publicly declared &s;he de&s;|pi&s;ed. Well acquainted with her capri|cious temper, I am not &s;urpri&s;ed at the incon&s;i&s;tency of her conduct. Such a di&s;|po&s;ition is the prolific parent of mi&s;ery, in private and &s;ocial life. The &s;chemes, which, but a few weeks &s;ince, &s;he pur&s;ued with the greate&s;t avidity, are now the cau&s;e of her

regret, as they tend to le&s;&s;en her own im|portance.</P>
<P>By her rigorous mea&s;ures, my uncle has been obliged to quit the elegant man|&s;ion in which he had long re&s;ided, and to occupy one in every re&s;pect inferior. Not|with&s;tanding his reduced circum&s;tances, his haughty &s;pirit will not &s;uffer him to re|turn to a trade in which he had been edu|cated, and from which a very reputable living might be derived. He prefers pa&s;&s;|ing upon the world as a gentleman with a thou&s;and wants and an empty pocket, rather than re&s;ume the character of a mechanic, which, he fears would exclude him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the &s;ociety of tho&s;e great men into which he has lately been introduced. How fal&s;e this ambition. In nothing do we &s;ooner di&s;cover our ignorance and folly, than in the want of a di&s;po&s;ition <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> con|form to our allotments in life. A laudable ambition is nece&s;&s;ary to carry us with re|putation through this world; but it is high|ly requi&s;ite to draw a line, and to di&s;card that which re&s;ults from a vain mind.</P>
<P>Such a connexion as my aunt's, makes me tremble at the di&s;tant idea of a change in

my &s;ituation. Real happy marriages are rare, when money and beauty are the governing motives, but I am re&s;olved not to purcha&s;e a hu&s;band with gold.

<P>IT is our intention &s;hortly to leave this city. From every circum&s;tance I ex|pect a union will &s;oon take place between Lucretia and Mr. Wilkins; Mr. Barton having given him permi&s;&s;ion to attend us to New-York. This gentleman is not a na|tive of Philadelphia, but for &s;everal years pa&s;t has tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s here in the ne|gotiating line; and having been &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;peculation, he has lately connected him&s;elf with a gentleman in Virginia. His character is, I believe, unexceptionable. Lucretia has frequently conver&s;ed with me upon the &s;ubject. She acknowledges her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but is re&s;olved, in a matter of &s;uch importance, to govern her&s;elf by the advice of her father who can only be &s;olicit|ous for her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>There are few females, Maria, who in the different &s;pheres in which they move, more con&s;picuou&s;ly irradiate and adorn their characters than this dear girl. She
<PB N="67" REF="025584_0066_0FCE0429C7069198">
was deprived of her mother at an age when &s;he mo&s;t needed her affectionate in&s;truc|tions, to &s;uppre&s;s the &s;pontaneous foibles of youth. Her father, ab&s;orbed in the happi|ne&s;s of an only child, exerted him&s;elf to im|pre&s;s her mind with &s;entiments which &s;hould make her happy; and after &s;he had completed her &s;chool education, made her the companion of his lei&s;ure hours. Pa&s;&s;ionately attached to her mother, he reli&s;hed no amu&s;ements in which Lucretia did not partake; but while he determined to render her the accompli&s;hed companion, he was al&s;o convinced, that it was a nece&s;&s;a|ry part of female education to be conver|&s;ant in dome&s;tic concerns; he therefore urged her attention to the family, in which &s;he cheerfully engaged. If &s;he &s;hone in the circles of refined &s;entiment, and was acquainted with the etiquette of the gay world, &s;he al&s;o practi&s;ed, in the bo&s;om of dome&s;tic duties, virtues which endeared her to every part of the family.</P>
<P>Through every action of her life is dif|fu&s;ed the &s;un&s;hine of tranquillity, but the partial pen of Caroline can never add a plume to the character of Lucretia. Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="68" REF="025584_0067_0FCE042BD2EB75C8">
of a di&s;po&s;ition and qualifications to render a de&s;erving man happy, I &s;incere|ly wi&s;h that &s;he may never form a connex|ion which &s;hall mar the enjoyment of her &s;ucceeding days.</P>
<P>There are many families in this place to whom I am attached. It is difficult, how|ever, to form a real friend&s;hip. A true friend is an acqui&s;ition &s;eldom to be obtained. Few are to be found calculated for the of|fices of friendly and &s;ocial intercour&s;e. When I reflect on my unprotected &s;itua|tion, I am not without my gloomy mo|ments; but Lucretia exerts her&s;elf to di&s;|pel them. Mrs. Lea&s;on frequently diverts us with her matches; &s;he claims the hon|our of having formed the intended connex|ion of our friends. Our landlady is by no means deficient in under&s;tanding, al|though a want of prudence runs parallel in her conduct. Connexions, big with importance to our future happine&s;s, &s;hould ever be the re&s;ult of unbia&s;&s;ed pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. For my own part I will never become a pro&s;tituted votary at Hymen's &s;hrine; love alone &s;hall cement the gentle bandage.</P>

I am much plea&s;ed with him; he is graceful and po|lite: His vi&s;it was &s;hort; but if I am not mi&s;taken, he is &s;entimental and accompli&s;h|ed. His countenance is expre&s;&s;ive; his eyes beam with under&s;tanding and gli&s;ten with &s;en&s;ibility. I have tried to check my pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, calling upon the guards of my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> heart, to be cautious and not to admit an unde&s;erving gue&s;t.

<P>IN my la&s;t letter I forgot to mention the name of my charming Captain. Ex|cu&s;e this neglect, and give me leave to in|troduce Capt. Evremont, to your particu|lar friend&s;hip. I am convinced Maria will give him a corner of her heart, from the attachment &s;he has long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for her Caroline. I &s;hould be doubly happy per&s;onally to pre&s;ent him to my friend, that from an acquaintance with him &s;he might &s;et a ju&s;t value upon his accompli&s;hments and virtues; but can only anticipate this event at a future period. His bu&s;ine&s;s with the Secretary at War has detained him in this city much longer than he ex|pected; and I have the plea&s;ure to a&s;&s;ure my dear Maria, that his brea&s;t beats conge|nial to the fonde&s;t wi&s;hes of Caroline's heart. Yes, my friend, we have re&s;olved one day to form a near and plea&s;ing con|nexion. Flattering as my pre&s;ent prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions are, they have opened upon me
<PB N="72" REF="025584_0071_0FCE043259B5B210">
new anxieties and cares. It is truly unfor|tunate he &s;hould, at this cri&s;is, be obliged to accept a commi&s;&s;ion, for I under&s;tand ne|ce&s;&s;ity, rather than an attachment to the mode of life, has urged him to the &s;tep. This gentleman is a native of Bo&s;ton, and was early placed by his parents with a re&s;|pectable merchant in that place. Soon af|ter the difficulties between Great-Britain and America commenced, that capital be|came a Briti&s;h garri&s;on. Trade was ne|ce&s;&s;arily laid a&s;ide. Thus at an important period was be deprived of his pro&s;pects of bu&s;ine&s;s in future life. Here he &s;uffered in the general calamity, and with a number of his fellow citizens was under the nece&s;|&s;ity of entering the army, where he contin|ued until the clo&s;e of the war. Upon the war breaking out with the Indians, he again accepted a commi&s;&s;ion merely for a &s;up|port. Being however engaged, it will not do for him to retreat, until the pre&s;ent campaign is decided. The honour of a &s;oldier, you know, is held dearer than his life. May the American army be the pe|culiar care of Providence, and the godde&s;s of health diffu&s;e her &s;miles upon them.

<P>YOU complain of my &s;ilence; and add, three po&s;ts have arrived without a line from your friend. The omi&s;&s;ion is by no means con&s;onant with the dictates of my heart. Such indeed has been my in|cumbered &s;ituation, that it has been out of my power to gratify my mo&s;t favourite in|clination. But you have no right to doubt my friend&s;hip. No; that heaven-born &s;park has long been kindling in my brea&s;t its extatic blaze. I thank you for the plea&s;ing retro&s;pect of our infant friend&s;hip. Tho&s;e days, indeed, were inexpre&s;&s;ibly hap|py which were illumed with your &s;ociety. The tender bud expanded under your in|vigorating influence, and received a &s;olid ba&s;is for its eternal exi&s;tence. Yes, my dear, it is not a meteor dancing in the ju|venile fancy, but a creative &s;un, which animates every dormant virtue, and beau|tifies every unfolding plant. Every mo|ment &s;ince my arrival in New-York, has
<PB N="75" REF="025584_0074_0FCE04379C2BBF08">
been devoted to Lucretia; and we are &s;till bu&s;y in preparing for the intended union. Mr. Barton, previous to our arrival, had written to his corre&s;pondent in Philadel|phia, and obtained &s;atisfactory informa|tion re&s;pecting Mr. Wilkins, and has been plea&s;ed to give his approbation to an early day for the celebration of the nuptials. Mr. Wilkins's bu&s;ine&s;s calling him to Vir|ginia, where he propo&s;es to &s;ettle at a place called Havre-de-Grace, I have promi&s;ed to accompany them. Having no partic|ular attachment to Philadelphia, I think it probable I &s;hall tarry with them a con|&s;iderable time. This, I flatter my&s;elf will not always be the ca&s;e; I begin to think it be&s;t to have &s;ome one to provide for and protect me. Old age will come, and the epithet of old maid is, you know, a &s;tigma, the appellation of which I will, if po&s;&s;ible, avoid.</P>
<P>I received a letter from Capt. Evremont, dated Fort-Pitt. He regrets his pre&s;ent engagements with the army, but flatters him&s;elf the troops rai&s;ing by Congre&s;s, will in one campaign, put a period to the war. Sincerely do I wi&s;h this may not prove an
<PB N="76" REF="025584_0075_0FCE043AD6086180">
illu&s;ive hope; but I fear they will be de|ceived. We have long habituated our|&s;elves to con&s;ider the Indians as an in&s;ignif|icant enemy, who are to be &s;ilenced by toys; it is now, however, policy to view them as a formidable body. Mr. Evre|mont adds, "it is generally believed the de|predations which the frontiers have expe|rienced for years pa&s;t, have been in&s;tigated by the garri&s;on at Detroit:" If &s;o, it is high|ly probable they will afford them every nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply. Fortunately my reflec|tions are taken off from the&s;e painful ideas, by my pre&s;ent avocations. I have receiv|ed a letter from my aunt Noble, complain|ing of our taking the rout to New-York, through Burlington, Bordentown, and Amboy, and in&s;i&s;ting on our making her hou&s;e, in our way back to Philadelphia. The rea&s;ons for pur&s;uing this road were not to avoid a repetition of her grievances, but that we might have an opportunity of &s;eeing this part of the country; having gratified our curio&s;ity, we intend to in|dulge her with a flying vi&s;it. She men|tions &s;ome new circum&s;tances relative to Eliza, and &s;olicits me to be upon my guard.
<PB N="77" REF="025584_0076_0FCE043C1ECAEF40">
I flatter my&s;elf my journey to Havre-de-Grace will prove my &s;ecurity. At that di&s;|tance, I &s;hall con&s;ider my&s;elf free from her per&s;ecutions. I am called down &s;tairs, and mu&s;t, for the pre&s;ent, lay a&s;ide my pen&mdash;</P>
<P>When I entered the parlour I &s;aw a gen|teel young man &s;itting with Lucretia, who bowing her head as I cro&s;&s;ed to a chair, &s;aid, "This, Sir, is the lady for whom you were inquiring." He aro&s;e, and addre&s;&s;ing me, ob&s;erved, his brother, Capt. Evremont, when in Philadelphia a few weeks &s;ince, by letter, had reque&s;ted him, as he pa&s;&s;ed through New-York, on his way to the We&s;t|ward, to call upon his intended &s;i&s;ter: I therefore, Mi&s;s, agreeably to his wi&s;hes, introduce my&s;elf to you. I a&s;&s;ured him of the &s;atisfaction his vi&s;it afforded, and made every inquiry after his connexions, which politene&s;s dictated. His vi&s;it was &s;hort. Lucretia invited him to dine the next day; but pleading a previous engagement, we were deprived of his company. He begged I would heighten his reception at Fort-Pitt, by honouring him with the charge of a letter, &s;aying he &s;hould call upon me the next evening for my commands, as he ex|pected
<PB N="78" REF="025584_0077_0FCE043D9C4CA8D0">
to leave the city immediately. Capt. Evremont had mentioned his broth|er's being &s;oon expected with recruits, and obtained my promi&s;e of writing by him. Plea&s;ed with &s;o favourable an opportunity, I entru&s;ted him with a lengthy letter, re|plete with encomiums upon my intended brother. I &s;incerely regretted his &s;hort &s;tay in New-York, as it deprived me of the happine&s;s of being fully acquainted with his merits. But a &s;oldier, my dear, is not the ma&s;ter of his time; nor can he impede the flying moments. I directed him to Mrs. Lea&s;on's, as a good boarding hou&s;e, while he tarried in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>How does the heaving &s;igh &s;well my agitated bo&s;om, at the anticipation of the dangers which await my friends: Yet, amid&s;t my di&s;tre&s;&s;ing thoughts, a beam of hope darts its animating rays, and gives me infinite &s;upport.</P>
<P>I have written you a lengthy letter; accept it as a token of my friend&s;hip; and may virtue, that fair daughter of heaven, de&s;cend and illume our path through the wilderne&s;s of life, and &s;weetening the re|flections of expiring moments, accompany us to the bright region of uninterrupted bli&s;s.</P>

<P>LUCRETIA, the amiable, the charming Lucretia, has now entered the li&s;t of matrons. The indi&s;&s;oluble knot is tied. The wedding was private; but we have yet to receive the congratulations of a numerous acquaintance.</P>
<P>Our levee is crouded, and I am obliged to obtrude upon tho&s;e hours, u&s;ually de|voted to Morpheus, or deprive my&s;elf of the gratification of writing to my dear Maria, who&s;e happine&s;s is ever interwoven with Caroline's. This &s;aid matrimony is a &s;e|rious thing; it makes me thoughtful. But I fancy I am more di&s;po&s;ed to be &s;erious, from the unhappy connexion of my aunt. It may, however, teach me an important le&s;&s;on; a le&s;&s;on, upon which the happine&s;s of my future life depends, never to connect my&s;elf with a man, who&s;e ignorance di&s;|qualifies him for an agreeable companion. The mo&s;t ignorant are, in general, the mo&s;t
<PB N="80" REF="025584_0079_0FCDE9D7645B1D18">
tenacious; and po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch high ideas of their imaginary excellencies, that they can|not allow any merit to their friends. A hand&s;ome, face, an engaging per&s;on, will be additionally plea&s;ing to my ta&s;te; but I flatter my&s;elf, they will never fa&s;cinate my judgment; nor the more captivating allurements of riches, infatuate my mind.</P>
<P>Virtues, emitted in the calm walks of &s;ocial life, render plea&s;ant the hours of re|tirement, and are alone calculated to in&s;ure dome&s;tic happine&s;s. Wi&s;dom is the lumi|nary of the mind; and, by her enlivening powers, di&s;&s;ipates tho&s;e painful &s;en&s;ations, which are &s;pontaneous, in the bo&s;om of ig|norance. Ignorance is the fruitful parent of every ungenerous principle.</P>
<P>To be connected with a man of inferior under&s;tanding to my own, would excite reflections which would imbitter life. Yet how many of tho&s;e matches do we daily &s;ee. Strange that we &s;hould be thus de|ceived. It is &s;aid the little urchin is blind, and this is all the apology that can be made for us. We frequently, however, purcha&s;e our &s;ight by a fatal &s;acrifice. Pray heaven,
<PB N="81" REF="025584_0080_0FCE04439C098D20">
it may never be the lot of Caroline, or her friend, to be thus wretchedly united.</P>
<P>Mr. Wilkins is &s;en&s;ible, genteel, and accompli&s;hed. I am not &s;killed in phi&s;iog|nomy, but fear he is avaricious and impet|uous. If &s;o, it mu&s;t ca&s;t a &s;able cloud over their dome&s;tic plea&s;ures; for the di&s;po&s;i|tion of Lucretia, is nobly generous. Ed|ucated in the &s;un&s;hine of fortune, &s;he has been enabled to indulge the emanations of a heart, replete with humanity. She has ever &s;ought objects of di&s;tre&s;s, and alleviated &s;uch as were &s;uffering with cheerle&s;s pover|ty. This di&s;po&s;ition is &s;o &s;eldom implant|ed in the bo&s;om of affluence, that its &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion would give me pain. The pru|dence of Lucretia, will ever dictate an ac|quie&s;cence with the will of her hu&s;band, and &s;he will readily relinqui&s;h many little dec|orations, which might be added to her own per&s;on, privately to gratify her god-like propen&s;ity. I will not anticipate, what may never take place: This will be mo|nopolizing a double portion of trouble. Away with this bane to happine&s;s. Let us take the incidents as they ari&s;e&punc; and, by confining our ideas within the dictates of

rea&s;on, we &s;hall at lea&s;t en&s;ure pre&s;ent peace.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, I was for &s;ome time edu|cated by a per&s;on, who&s;e peculiar plea&s;ure it was to colour, with the mo&s;t gloomy &s;hades, every expected event. This occa|&s;ioned an early aver&s;ion in my mind to anticipation.</P>
<P>Many u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons are to be learnt from ob&s;ervation, and great is the danger of contracting bad habits. Had not my judgement been directed by my decea&s;ed uncle and aunt, there is no doubt but I &s;hould have imbibed that di&s;po&s;ition, &s;o in|jurious to the enjoyment of life. At the early period in which I was placed under the protection of my aunt Noble, my rea|&s;on was not &s;ufficiently expanded, to decide for my&s;elf. Tho&s;e youth, who are within the limits of enlightened in&s;truction, re|ceive inexpre&s;&s;ible advantages. Thus the friendly hints of my uncle and aunt Frank|lin, led me to reflect upon many foibles, and armed me again&s;t the rock, upon which my aunt Noble's dome&s;tic happine&s;s &s;plit. I have long &s;ince been convinced of the folly of con&s;idering the world at large as

Relating dome&s;tic difficulties abroad, is in|con&s;i&s;tent with the rules of &s;ocial happine&s;s, and repugnant to every principle of polite|ne&s;s.

<P>I have not dwelt thus upon the &s;ubject, becau&s;e I think you need the le&s;&s;on; but as the ob&s;ervations naturally occurred, I felt no wi&s;h to re&s;train them.</P>

<P>HAVING pa&s;&s;ed through the u&s;ual ceremonies of receiving the congratulatory vi&s;its of our acquaintances, we ha&s;tened to this city, where we mu&s;t again &s;ubmit to that ridiculous parade, cu&s;tom has e&s;tab|li&s;hed upon the&s;e occa&s;ions. In my view, nothing is &s;o fooli&s;h as the &s;itting our&s;elves up for a &s;how, and becoming an object of animadver&s;ion. It is a ceremony I am re|&s;olved to di&s;pen&s;e with, however oppo&s;ed to the ideas of the world; for I can never con&s;ent to a form &s;o contrary to my feel|ings, &s;o derogatory to my judgement. To comply with it, requires more fortitude and patience than has fallen to my &s;hare. Our ta&s;k, however, will not be &s;o &s;evere as at New-York. Morning vi&s;its will be &s;hort, and we have no time to devote to afternoon company. This circum&s;tance will al&s;o relieve Mr. Wilkins.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lea&s;on received us with great po|litene&s;s. I have made inquiries of her,
<PB N="85" REF="025584_0084_0FCE044BED960F28">
re&s;pecting my intended brother, as I rec|ommended him to her hou&s;e for lodgings, but can obtain no information of him. It is probable he fell in with company upon the road, who introduced him el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Several weeks have elap&s;ed, &s;ince I heard from Capt. Evremont. His &s;ilence is uncommon; and gives me great anxiety; nor can tho&s;e amu&s;ements to which I have long been partial, or the joyful event of Lucretia's union, obliterate my fears. I am much indi&s;po&s;ed. There is an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;ympathy between the mind and body; they are mutually affect|ed. Hope is the anodyne of life, a balm to the afflicted, and an animating meteor, which di&s;&s;ipates the dew of di&s;appointment; but fear, by depre&s;&s;ing the &s;pirits, brings on di&s;ea&s;e, which often terminates life. I love to get by my&s;elf. Reflection is plea&s;|ing. To drop a tear upon the recollection of my friends, is a luxury to my &s;oul. Friend&s;hip, true friend&s;hip, is a child of heaven.</P>
<P>Agreeably to promi&s;e, we made Trenton in our way to this city, and found my aunt, as u&s;ual, complaining. Our vi&s;it was

&s;hort; Lucretia politely gave her an invi|tation to vi&s;it her at Havre-de-Grace. An invitation I doubt not but &s;he will accept; &s;ome premonition will tell her the journey will be of &s;ervice, and point out a thou&s;and chimerical advantages. Civility is fre|quently a tyrant, which compels us to do many things contrary to our wi&s;hes. You mu&s;t excu&s;e the &s;hortne&s;s of this letter.

<P>THE gloom which pervaded my mind when I la&s;t addre&s;&s;ed you, has &s;ub|&s;ided. I have been gratified with a letter from Capt. Evremont. It had laid in the war office more than a week. He does not mention his brother. I &s;u&s;pect there is &s;ome deception in this affair.</P>
<P>My aunt has repeatedly a&s;&s;ured me, no mea&s;ures were unpur&s;ued by Eliza to ob|tain my letters, and that through this chan|nel, &s;he becomes acquainted with my pri|vate intentions.</P>
<P>I am gaining &s;trength, and hope, I &s;hall &s;oon be able to attend Lucretia home: She has been particularly attentive to me in my indi&s;po&s;ition. By her per&s;ua&s;ions I con&s;ented to call in a phy&s;ician, who has had the impudence to &s;tyle my di&s;order <HI>nervous.</HI> A pretty cu&s;tom of the faculty, to cla&s;s tho&s;e complaints, which they have not &s;ufficient abilities to remove, under this denomination! By placing the di&s;ea&s;e

upon tho&s;e delicate organs, they conclude, &s;hould their applications be un&s;ucce&s;sful, their patients cannot cen&s;ure their judg|ment, and they will thereby elude reflec|tion.</P>
<P>There is not, in creation, an epithet more wounding to my feelings. To be <HI>nervous,</HI> is generally to be a <HI>fool</HI>; a <HI>plague</HI> to our&s;elves and a <HI>torment</HI> to our friends. Could I po&s;&s;ibly think my&s;elf &s;o devoid of &s;tability, &s;o de&s;titute of philo&s;ophy, &s;o depraved in my mind, I would in&s;tant|ly &s;eek &s;ome unfrequented rece&s;s, where mortal eye &s;hould never reach me.</P>
<P>The &s;agacious doctor had no &s;ooner de|termined my di&s;ea&s;e, than my re&s;entment was excited. I immediately di&s;carded his pre&s;criptions, and refu&s;ed his farther attend|ance. If that is the ca&s;e, &s;aid I, away with phy&s;icians; medicines are debilitating, re&s;olution &s;hall be my cure; I will never be cheated of the plea&s;ures of life, by ner|vous di&s;orders. Since this determination, my amendment has been rapid. Profit by the le&s;&s;on, Maria, and be a&s;&s;ured, re&s;olu|tion is the &s;tronge&s;t antidote that can po&s;&s;i|bly be admini&s;tered, in nervous attacks.</P>

<P>Unfortunately for Mrs. Lea&s;on, Laura is ab&s;ent from home, con&s;equently a dou|ble attention devolves upon her. Could you &s;ee this ta&s;ty widow, who&s;e grey hairs, denote her advanced years, decorated in all the gaiety of youth, I am &s;ure your &s;entiments would accord with mine. Nothing expre&s;&s;es a want of judgment, more, than not complying with a dre&s;s &s;uited to declining life. The gaieties of youth, &s;hould certainly be laid a&s;ide, as

<P>Good &s;en&s;e will ever di&s;cover it&s;elf throughout our conduct, but in nothing more con&s;picuou&s;ly than this. I have frequently &s;een the picture of a very aged lady, &s;eated at her toilet, who by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of her dre&s;&s;ing maid (from who&s;e countenance a &s;triking le&s;&s;on might be de|duced) is decorating her&s;elf in all the fine|ry of a young lady, ju&s;t entering upon the theatre of life.

I wi&s;h to purcha&s;e it for Mrs. Lea&s;on, and am re|&s;olved, if I can ever obtain it, to pre&s;ent it to her. Such characters di&s;cover minds as unimproved as the de&s;arts of Lybia. Old age is indeed a de&s;olating period, if the illuminating beams of wi&s;dom have not dawned upon the mind; but if &s;he irradi|ates the under&s;tanding, we can view the clo&s;e of life with re&s;ignation.

<P>WE arrived here the 20th in&s;tant. The journey has been of infinite &s;ervice to my health. I am extremely plea&s;ed with this town. It is &s;ituated upon a mo&s;t delightful river, and appears de&s;igned, by Nature, for trade.</P>
<P>Mr. Wilkins's hou&s;e is peculiarly plea&s;|ant, as it commands an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect. The furniture has not arrived. We are at pre&s;ent in the family of Mrs. Gardner; I will introduce them to my Maria. This la|dy has been &s;ome years a widow, left with three daughters and two &s;ons; the two elde&s;t girls are the epitome of their mother. It may be expected, that children, educat|ed by the &s;ame parent, &s;hould imbibe &s;imilar &s;entiments and habits.</P>
<P>But this family demon&s;trates, that na|ture, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by art, frequently implants principles in the youthful brea&s;t, far &s;upe|rior to the mo&s;t refined &s;tudy.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="025584_0092_0FCE0457DAC875E8">Mrs. G. is a woman of great ambition, with a high opinion of her own abilities, &s;he prides her&s;elf upon the &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;pecta|bility of her character, boa&s;ts much of her dome&s;tic economy, a&s;&s;umes a large &s;hare of merit from the richne&s;s of her clothing, exerts her&s;elf to be thought a learned wom|an, and aims to monopolize re&s;pect from the idea of keeping the be&s;t company in the place.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the ju&s;t traits in the character of my landlady and her elde&s;t daughters.</P>
<P>Educated in &s;uch &s;entiments, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that dre&s;&s;ing and vi&s;iting, are the favourite employments of the young ladies, who are particularly remarked for being in the &s;treets. Fond of being &s;een, they inquire from &s;hop to &s;hop, for articles they have no intention to pur|cha&s;e. But &s;hopping is a charming amu&s;e|ment; it gives them an opportunity to &s;hew them&s;elves abroad. They de&s;pi&s;e every thing "wulgar," and their friends are the "mo&s;t affable&s;t," and the "mo&s;t agreea|ble&s;t" in the world.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gardner and her daughter's lo|quacity might be overlooked, if every ex|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="94" REF="025584_0093_0FCE045A27C88A30">
was not tortured by an ignorance of their own language.</P>
<P>Had you been at table a few days &s;ince, you would have been diverted; it was diffi|cult to refrain from laughing. Having dined, Mrs. Gardner filled her gla&s;s, and pa&s;&s;ing the wine, reque&s;ted the company to drink "a good hu&s;band to <HI>orphan</HI> wid|ows." I he&s;itated; for had my life de|pended, I could not imagine what &s;enti|ment &s;he meant to convey. I however repeated the toa&s;t. Anxious to avoid laugh|ing, and in ha&s;te to di&s;pen&s;e with the wine, I choaked my&s;elf, and was obliged to leave the room; glad indeed of an oppor|tunity to retire. Lucretia improved the moment, and followed me up chamber, where we had high diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Fanny, the younge&s;t daughter, is a very different character. Delicate in her beha|viour, enlightened in her under&s;tanding, &s;he &s;peaks with propriety, determines with judgment, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a peculiar &s;oftne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, which, like the gentle lu&s;tre of the evening &s;tar, beams in her expre&s;&s;ive eye. The&s;e &s;ecure her the partiality of the boarders; and her attention to their little
<PB N="95" REF="025584_0094_0FCE045B9AB8F140">
wants, enhances her in their e&s;teem. Her mind indeed, is an a&s;&s;emblage of virtues. I am not fond of adopting new friends, but there is in this dear girl, &s;omething &s;o en|gaging, &s;o congenial with my feelings, that I am re&s;olved to endear my&s;elf to her, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to become nece&s;&s;ary to her happi|ne&s;s. She appears to po&s;&s;e&s;s a natural vi|vacity, which is at pre&s;ent clouded, by &s;ome unhappy event. If this is the ca&s;e, time, and a&s;&s;iduity, &s;hall di&s;cover it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gardner's elde&s;t &s;on is a man of fortune; it is, therefore, unnece&s;&s;ary to add a man of friends. Although encircled by the fa&s;cinating &s;miles of this plea&s;ing deity, he claims no preten&s;ions to happine&s;s. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an anxious, par&s;imonious di&s;po&s;i|tion, he is deprived of tho&s;e tranquil &s;en&s;a|tions which produce gratitude. Never having &s;ipped of di&s;appointment's bitter cup, his heart is callous to the tears of &s;or|row. Ab&s;orbed in the pur&s;uit of wealth, many &s;ocial virtues lie dormant. Perplex|ed, lea&s;t his plans in bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould prove un&s;ucce&s;sful, he cannot reli&s;h pre&s;ent ble&s;&s;|ings, and from an unhappy temper contin|ually &s;uffers imaginary difficulties. Rich|es

rather augment than le&s;&s;en his anxiety. He is a &s;tranger to that real enjoyment, which tho&s;e experience, who&s;e bo&s;oms are melio|rated by humanity, and irradiated with be|nevolence. Contentment, that maid of heavenly origin, ab&s;conds his mental re|gion, and takes her re&s;idence in the more &s;erene heart. When we &s;ee tho&s;e who have been nur&s;ed in the indulgent lap of fortune, deprived of tempers to enjoy her gifts, con|&s;tantly agitated and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, we certainly cannot envy their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. It will en|force the ob&s;ervation that money alone is in&s;ufficient to &s;ecure peace.</P>
<P>Mr. Gardner is unmarried, and free from every incumbrance; he wants only a mind to enjoy the abundance which Prov|idence has poured upon him.</P>
<P>His brother is married, and has a large family dependant on him. There is a de|pre&s;&s;ion in his countenance which excites the tendere&s;t feelings of my heart. He is, I believe, a child of &s;orrow. Having in|dulged my&s;elf in repeated conver&s;ations with him, I am deceived if he does not po&s;&s;e&s;s a good under&s;tanding, a &s;incere &s;oul, and a feeling mind. Every new in|terview

<P>SINCE I la&s;t addre&s;&s;ed my dear Maria, I have had an opportunity of be|coming more acquainted with the unfortu|nate Mr. Gardner. Fanny entered my chamber this morning, and reque&s;ted me to favour her with &s;ome entertaining books. There was a number upon my table: I de&s;ired her to &s;elect &s;uch as would be plea&s;ing to her. Engaged in reading, &s;he had reached the door; when looking up and &s;eeing but a &s;mall pamphlet in her hand, I a&s;ked her, if there were none con|&s;onant with her ta&s;te? Her heart was full; the pearly tear gli&s;tened in her eyes: She could not articulate. Fanny, continued I, what di&s;tre&s;&s;es you? Believe me your friend; unbo&s;om your affliction. She in|clined to retire. I aro&s;e, took her hand, and led her to a chair; &s;he laid the book upon the table; I glanced my eyes upon it, and found it a play, entitled, "The
<PB N="99" REF="025584_0098_0FCE046333BB6880">
Brothers." Curio&s;ity was excited; my attachment for her increa&s;ed; I experienc|ed all that inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;ympathy, which is united with tho&s;e &s;weet &s;en&s;ations of a feeling mind, and was &s;ilent for &s;ome min|utes, that &s;he might give vent to the effu|&s;ions of her grief. Tears having afforded a momentary relief, I re&s;umed my &s;olicita|tions, a&s;&s;uring her of my prepo&s;e&s;&s;ions; ob&s;erving, I had noticed an anxiety upon her countenance, the cau&s;e of which, if po&s;&s;ible, it was my wi&s;h to remove. She replied, "I thank you for your friend&s;hip; nor can I refu&s;e your reque&s;t. The title of that book, forced upon me many di&s;a|greeable ideas, by reminding me of the &s;it|uation of my brothers; the younge&s;t of whom has experienced a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mis|fortunes. Long initiated in the &s;chool of &s;evere di&s;appointment, with the mo&s;t eco|nomical attention, and clo&s;e&s;t indu&s;try, he finds it difficult to &s;upport his family; yet his de&s;titute circum&s;tances make no im|pre&s;&s;ion upon the heart of Charles, who, by great &s;ucce&s;s, has accumulated immen&s;e property. Intoxicated by the inebriating bowl of pro&s;perity, he lives only for him|&s;elf.</P>

Encourage the friendly delu&s;ion: It will a&s;&s;i&s;t you in conquering tho&s;e reflections &s;o prejudicial to you. She was now called.</P>
<P>The great contra&s;t in this family fre|quently engaged my reflection. It is in|deed happy for &s;ociety that characters, &s;imilar to Mr. Gardner's, are not more frequent. How much more amiable the man, who &s;tudies to communicate happi|ne&s;s, who&s;e brea&s;t beats with humanity, and who li&s;tens to the voice of &s;orrow, with a di&s;po&s;ition to mitigate human mi&s;ery. The remembrance of &s;uch is truly grateful to the children of affliction.</P>

appears detached from dome&s;tic plea&s;ures. We have but little of his compa|ny; his fondne&s;s for variety, renders home di&s;ta&s;teful to him. The a&s;&s;iduity and at|tention of the lover, is &s;uper&s;eded by un|pardonable neglect. The woman who a &s;hort time &s;ince engro&s;&s;ed every plea&s;urea|ble idea, he now views without emotion; and, I &s;ometimes think, returns to, with re|gret. Bu&s;ine&s;s engages his daily attention, and the tavern his lei&s;ure hours; but Mr. Wilkins is not an unfa&s;hionable hu&s;band. In this era of politene&s;s, to &s;ee a man at|tached to his wife, denotes a weakne&s;s, which renders him an object of contempt. Love at pre&s;ent is a pa&s;&s;ion but little un|der&s;tood. The gentlemen ab&s;orbed in &s;ome &s;triking attachment, generally believe them&s;elves caught in the alluring &s;nare, and re&s;olve to obtain the object of their &s;uppo|&s;ed affection. Their favourite wi&s;h accom|pli&s;hed, they frequently di&s;cover their mi&s;|take, too late to retrieve the error, and thus become wretched for life. Happy marriages would be more frequent, were the fir&s;t impul&s;e to ari&s;e, from the percep|tion

<P>Love is the offspring of a vigorous fan|cy: It is born of youth, and if nur&s;ed with care, will, in the calm &s;un&s;hine of declining life, meliorate into the &s;ublime&s;t friend&s;hip. Having been matured by reciprocal confi|dence and mutual e&s;teem, it &s;oftens the winter of old age. The plea&s;ing emana|tions, which re&s;ult from &s;o refined a &s;ource, are unknown to tho&s;e, who&s;e minds have been enervated by di&s;&s;ipation, and poi&s;on|ed by vice. He only, who&s;e happine&s;s is centered in a de&s;erving family, can realize the bli&s;s.</P>
<P>I have received &s;everal letters from Capt. Evremont, dated Fort Pitt. The la&s;t mentions the arrival of his brother, but does not acknowledge the receipt of the letter I wrote by him. I am flattered with the pro&s;pect of &s;eeing him, as he expects to vi&s;it Philadelphia, with di&s;patches to the War Office. Exceedingly I regret his en|gagements in the military line, and &s;incerely wi&s;h he could retire from the &s;cene of war, with honour; but this is impo&s;&s;ible. My heart is his faithful attendant. By the

<P>A letter from my aunt is ju&s;t hand|ed me. She complains of her &s;itua|tion, declares it impracticable to &s;up|port her&s;elf, upon the &s;mall &s;tipend &s;he annually receives, and re&s;olves to attempt a reconciliation with her hu&s;band. The rapid increa&s;e of her indi&s;po&s;ition makes her anxious to be with tho&s;e "who&s;e du|ty it is to provide, and attend upon her. But &s;ome ob&s;tacles are previou&s;ly to be re|moved. The children mu&s;t be bani&s;hed from home; &s;he did not marry them and is determined never to live with them. It is the duty of a man, to make every &s;acri|fice to the happine&s;s of his wife." This novel method of rea&s;oning, &s;he has adopt|ed, is mortifying to my feelings. I cannot believe a man mu&s;t di&s;card all affection for his children, to gratify an unrea&s;onable woman. Should &s;he obtain her wi&s;hes, and be received upon the terms propo&s;ed, with a di&s;po&s;ition naturally ira&s;cible, a reconciliation will but little affect her hap|pine&s;s. She urges me to addre&s;s my uncle
<PB N="107" REF="025584_0106_0FCE0471B99CFA48">
upon the &s;ubject of her return; but I am decidedly re&s;olved to have no hand in the affair.</P>
<P>Her annual income is amply compe|tent to a genteel &s;upport, would &s;he ex|erci&s;e economy, and learn the di&s;tinction between a prodigal, and a liberal mind; but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an extravagant inclination, &s;he is led into a thou&s;and unnece&s;&s;ary expen&s;es.</P>
<P>I find &s;ome of Clarimont's relations are in this place. They are people in genteel life: I wi&s;h exceedingly to be acquainted with them, that I may remove from their minds, prejudices imbibed again&s;t me.</P>
<P>The unfortunate &s;ituation of Mrs. Gar|dner's younge&s;t &s;on, excites in my brea&s;t, many painful emotions. The advantages of a large fortune, are incon&s;iderable, ex|clu&s;ive of the power it gives, of imparting happine&s;s to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. A mind right|ly affected by the bounty of heaven, will never feel happier, than when engaged in le&s;&s;ening the wants of de&s;erving poverty.</P>
<P>I am grateful to Providence, that I have it in my power, to afford &s;ome &s;mall relief, to the family of Mr. Gardner. From re|peated conver&s;ations with Fanny, I find his mind delicate and &s;u&s;ceptible. To con|fer
<PB N="108" REF="025584_0107_0FCE0472E38ACCF8">
favours upon &s;uch, is painful as well as plea&s;ing. A trifle given by the truly hu|mane and benevolent, will afford infinite|ly more &s;atisfaction to the feeling mind, than a thou&s;and times its value, pre&s;ented by the hand of indelicacy, or the air of re|luctance. Such favours I have often &s;een, and my heart has bled, for the unhappy dependant. I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, few know how to confer obligations. The children of adver&s;ity &s;urely have &s;ufficient to bear, without the addition of unfeeling favours. I was &s;ome time at a lo&s;s how to pre&s;ent the trifle I intended to be&s;tow; but finally adopted the idea of addre&s;&s;ing a let|ter to him, with a bank bill enclo&s;ed, which I &s;ent to the po&s;t-office: This, I flatter my&s;elf, will relieve him from his pre&s;ent difficulties. Through Fanny, I &s;hall be ac|quainted with his nece&s;&s;ities; and when I hear from my agent in Philadelphia, it will be in my power further to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>There is a report circulating in this place, that my cou&s;in, who was left heir with me, to my uncle's e&s;tate, is a pri&s;oner with the Indians; and not killed as was &s;uppo&s;ed, at the defeat of Major Willis. The &s;tory

<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible, Maria, to ac|quaint our&s;elves with either the foibles or virtues of mankind, unle&s;s we follow them to private life. In public, deception en|robes their actions. A wi&s;h to &s;ecure the good opinion of the world, induces them to conceal their imperfections, and they often e&s;tabli&s;h a fal&s;e reputation. But when retired from the eye of cen&s;ure and critici&s;m, caution lies dormant, and the actions are &s;haded by natural vices, or il|lumed with enviable virtues.</P>
<P>I am hourly convinced of the ju&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, notwith&s;tanding the exertions of Lucretia, to conceal the fretful, penurious <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of Mr. Wilkins. His <HI>circum&s;tances</HI> cannot occa&s;ion him to be par&s;i|monious, or ill-natured; for his fortune is ea&s;y, and his pro&s;pects flattering. Yet in his family he is contracted: He lives with|out
<PB N="111" REF="025584_0110_0FCE04789765B348">
company; not from a wi&s;h to be alone. The &s;ocial principles are &s;trongly interwov|en in his heart, and he has it amply in his power, to gratify a di&s;po&s;ition &s;o conge|nial to human nature. But he &s;eeks plea&s;ures abroad. Dome&s;tic life, to him is dive&s;ted of charms; yet Lucretia is uni|formly the &s;ame engaging woman; and with a voice, &s;oftened by &s;incere affection, &s;he ever meets him with a &s;weetne&s;s pecu|liar to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I ye&s;terday went unexpectedly into her chamber, and found her in tears. A|larmed at a circum&s;tance &s;o uncommon, my curio&s;ity was excited. Shall there, &s;aid I, be any incident in the life of Lu|cretia, with which &s;he will not acquaint Caroline? The chry&s;tal drop trembled in her eye; &s;he was &s;ilent. Going to her, I &s;eized her hand, and putting it to my lips, the pearly tear bedewed the &s;weet impre&s;&s;ion; "until you evince your confidence I mu&s;t be wretched; wherein have I forfeited your friend&s;hip?" Her eyes were fixed upon me; and beaming with an additional expre&s;&s;ion, &s;he replied, "Your friendly endeavours to extenuate my &s;uf|ferings,
<PB N="112" REF="025584_0111_0FCE04799B255B28">
add a &s;weet ingredient to this mo|mentary indulgence. But there are, my dear, many occurrences which take place, intere&s;ting only to our&s;elves. It would, therefore, be cruel to impart them to friends, only to allay their plea&s;ures. Upon this principle, you will excu&s;e my &s;ilence."</P>
<P>There can be no circum&s;tance, I ob&s;erv|ed, in the life of Lucretia, which does not deeply intere&s;t my heart. Your &s;ilence is too di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. "I have no cau&s;e," &s;he continued, "to di&s;tru&s;t a confidence, long de&s;ervedly placed in the bo&s;om of Caroline; but you mu&s;t pardon my refu&s;ing to render you unhappy. Remember I am now a wife. The little &s;ecrets once intru&s;ted to you, as they concerned no one but my|&s;elf, I was at liberty to divulge; but it is now my duty to be &s;ilent: Nor are you unacquainted with my &s;entiments. And as I cannot deviate from principles &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, you will require no further apology for my refu&s;al."</P>
<P>Convinced her happine&s;s was interrupt|ed by the behaviour of Mr. Wilkins, I could no longer urge her to a conduct we
<PB N="113" REF="025584_0112_0FCE047CCC85B040">
had &s;o often reprobated in my aunt Noble; and commending her re&s;olution, left the chamber.</P>
<P>It is &s;eldom, per&s;ons of &s;imilar inclina|tions become united. Should it be the will of the Deity to connect me with a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;entiments e&s;&s;entially oppo&s;ed to mine, may I copy from Lucretia. In early life I have been turned a&s;ide from the flowery path of gaiety and indulgence, by the invidious temper of Eliza; but I will not take the painful retro&s;pect. Im|agination is the mi&s;tre&s;s of happine&s;s. I will flatter my&s;elf, &s;ucceeding days will &s;mile upon me, and by encouraging the fond idea, enjoy my pre&s;ent ble&s;&s;ings: Among the&s;e, I cla&s;s Maria's friend&s;hip; this ever affords me inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>MANY phantoms of happine&s;s, have danced upon my imagination, which have vani&s;hed before enjoyed; and al|though I exert my&s;elf, to extenuate the evils of life, I find it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ecure my plea&s;ures. Some new incident over|takes me, which bla&s;ts my ideal &s;ecurity, and involves me in unfore&s;een difficulties.</P>
<P>A few evenings &s;ince, hurt by &s;ome re|flections Mr. Wilkins ca&s;t upon Lucretia, I retired to my chamber. The weather was extremely warm, my window open, and the curtain down. Inclined to indulge the &s;en&s;ations I then experienced, I left the room without a light, and had &s;et &s;ome minutes regretting his unhappy irritability, when my attention was called to the &s;ound of my name in the &s;treet; and cautiou&s;ly removing the curtain, I &s;aw two per&s;ons, at a little di&s;tance from the gate, engaged in conver&s;ation; but notwith&s;tanding my clo&s;e&s;t attention, I heard only interrupted

&s;entences. "By your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the plan cannot fail of &s;ucce&s;s," was &s;ufficient to ex|cite my fears, and hurrying down &s;tairs, I intended to &s;end the girl to di&s;cover who they were, but not finding her, the thought immediately occurred, that &s;he was engag|ing again&s;t me. I ha&s;tened into the parlour, and ob&s;erving Lucretia had been in tears, made no mention of the affair, until the next day, when I communicated it to her and Mr. Wilkins: They &s;trongly impre&s;|&s;ed caution upon me. This circum&s;tance at pre&s;ent is enrobed in my&s;tery.</P>
<P>I am unwilling to believe Eliza &s;till in|tends to pur&s;ue me. Her di&s;po&s;ition will deprive me of the little happine&s;s allotted to human life.

<P>IN my la&s;t, I mentioned my over|hearing part of a conver&s;ation, as I &s;uppo&s;|ed, between the maid and a &s;tranger at the gate, which excited painful &s;u&s;picions in my mind; the&s;e were not without founda|tion.</P>
<P>Mr. Wilkins being obliged to go to Bal|timore upon bu&s;ine&s;s, Mrs. Wilkins and my&s;elf, in his ab&s;ence, made a vi&s;it to a Mrs. Drayton, who lives &s;ome di&s;tance from us, where we pa&s;&s;ed the evening. In return|ing home, we were under the nece&s;&s;ity of cro&s;&s;ing a lone&s;ome place, called Long-Acre. There being only one gentleman with us; many di&s;agreeable ideas loitered upon my mind, from the recollection of there having been &s;everal robberies lately committed upon this &s;pot. The evening was clear and &s;erene. The pen&s;ive moon had early retired from the &s;pangled hemi&s;|phere, and was journeying in &s;ome other clime. The way through this place was
<PB N="118" REF="025584_0117_0FCE0486DA1ED038">
&s;o narrow, it was impo&s;&s;ible we could walk together. Politene&s;s dictating I &s;hould re&s;ign our gallant to Lucretia, I cautiou&s;ly went a little before. Soon ob&s;erving two per&s;ons coming towards me, I walked &s;low|ly, for Mrs. Wilkins and Mr. Lee to over|take me, fancying my&s;elf &s;ecure with them immediately behind.</P>
<P>A gentleman now came up, and calling me by name, begged I would accept his arm. I thanked him, and declined; a&s;&s;ur|ing him, he had the advantage of me. He replied, "I have frequently had the hon|our of being in your company at Mrs. Gardner's, and am &s;orry you have &s;o &s;oon forgot a fellow boarder." I begged his pardon, urging the evening as an apology for my inattention, and accepted his offer. Nor was I a little gratified in having addi|tional company. We &s;oon reached the corner of a &s;treet, which he recommended me to take, as being much nearer to Mrs. Wilkins's. Infatuation had lulled my ap|prehen&s;ions. I complied with his reque&s;t. Nor did my fears return, until I had pa&s;&s;|ed a con&s;iderable way in this road: It then occurred to me I was deceived. I was
<PB N="119" REF="025584_0118_0FCE0487E6260978">
now in a remote, unfrequented &s;pot, hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed no hou&s;e &s;ince we turned the corner. I at this moment recollected that the per&s;on, who was with my deceiver, parted from him, ju&s;t before he came up with me, and I already believed my&s;elf in the power of a woman, who&s;e re&s;entment I dreaded, yet dared not di&s;cover my fears. Every &s;tep I went forward, I believed ha&s;t|ened my misfortune; but I could not re|turn.</P>
<P>Having recour&s;e to deception, I pur|po&s;ely turned my ancle, pretending the &s;everity of pain prevented my walking, and &s;etting down by the &s;ide of a fence, un|buckled my &s;hoe, and feigned great di&s;tre&s;s. In this &s;ituation I remained near half an hour, when the di&s;tant &s;ound of a carriage, encouraged the hope of relief. On com|ing oppo&s;ite to me, it &s;topped, and my gallant was called by a whi&s;tle. The cer|tainty of my fate, occa&s;ioned an agitation which almo&s;t deprived me of &s;en&s;es. I &s;creamed as they rai&s;ed me up to hurry me into the coach. At this in&s;tant Mr. Lee arrived to my deliverance. The villains precipitately retreated. I called for Lu|cretia.
<PB N="120" REF="025584_0119_0FCE04897380E7F0">
Convey me to my friend, &s;aid I. Mr. Lee endeavoured to compo&s;e me, a&s;|&s;uring me I was &s;afe; and that Mrs. Wil|kins, upon mi&s;&s;ing me, had &s;topped at the hou&s;e of a doctor May, where &s;he remain|ed waiting for me. My impatience to meet her, hurried me beyond my &s;trength, and when I reached the doctor's, I was for a con&s;iderable time &s;en&s;ele&s;s, one fainting fit rapidly &s;ucceeding another. The applications of my friends finally compo&s;ed my &s;pirits, and recovering, I found Lucretia &s;itting at my &s;ide, &s;upporting my head up|on her &s;houlder. "I have been an equal &s;harer with you, my dear," &s;aid &s;he, "What have I not anticipated! Language is in|adequate to the feelings of my heart; but Caroline is again re&s;tored."</P>
<P>The doctor and Mr. Lee, paid us every po&s;&s;ible attention. They urged us to tar|ry till morning; but we in&s;i&s;ting upon going home, they procured a carriage and accompanied us. When we reached the door of Mrs. Wilkins, the clock &s;truck one; the girl who came to the door appear|ed alarmed. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with our adventure, and alive to apprehen&s;ions, we could not
<PB N="121" REF="025584_0120_0FCE048BA90DDB70">
&s;upport the idea of being left without a pro|tector; and having no man in the hou&s;e, &s;olicited Mr. Lee to take a bed. The doc|tor took his leave, promi&s;ing to call upon us the next day. This incident deprived us of &s;leep. My heart was filled with grati|tude, for my repeated e&s;capes; and the tear of &s;en&s;ibility, which moi&s;tened the cheek of Lucretia, gave me new proof of her friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>In the morning, agreeably to promi&s;e, Doctor May called upon us. You can better judge, than I expre&s;s, my a&s;toni&s;h|ment, when upon his entering the room, I di&s;covered the countenance of a man, who&s;e character has been the mo&s;t aban|doned. I recoiled at the remembrance of his vices. The&s;e were &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon my mind, from his having been too &s;ucce&s;sful in the ruin of a particular friend in Philadelphia. To elude the re&s;entment of her friends he ab&s;conded; and changing his name, putting on a wig, and wearing a large patch over one eve, practiced phy|&s;ic, as I afterwards found, in this place. But at this moment it was nece&s;&s;ary to com|mand my feelings. His vi&s;it was painful;
<PB N="122" REF="025584_0121_0FCE048D69483108">
I re&s;olved, however, not ha&s;tily to expo&s;e his character; but to inform my&s;elf if he was re&s;pected at Havre-de-Grace, hoping he had become a good member of &s;ociety. Upon que&s;tioning Fanny, I found he was yet thought a very great libertine, and &s;hunned by the virtuous of the fair &s;ex. I now believed it my duty to caution Mrs. Wilkins, and urged her giving orders to the &s;ervant, &s;hould he call again, to tell him we were out.</P>
<P>The &s;tory now circulated abroad; and our friends, advi&s;ed to adverti&s;ing a re|ward for the di&s;covery of the villains; but expecting Mr. Wilkins in a few days, we concluded to wait his return, and govern our&s;elves by his advice. I cannot recal my pre&s;ervation to mind, without bedew|ing the altar of gratitude with tears; and my heart continually expands in ejacula|tions to heaven. May the watchful eye of Providence, &s;till pre&s;erve me, and render futile the plans of the enraged Eliza.</P>

<P>MY &s;ituation is truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. A favourite child of wretchedne&s;s, with the additional affliction of having involved my dear, my loved Lucretia. How &s;hall I &s;upport the painful idea, or be &s;ufficient|ly compo&s;ed to recite the unhappy &s;tory. The balm prepared by the lenient hand of friend&s;hip, is inadequate to the de&s;ign; and even virtue's angel form, cannot &s;hield me from poignant &s;ufferings. To be the cau&s;e of rendering Lucretia unhappy, is a reflection I cannot &s;u&s;tain. The return of Mr. Wilkins, which in anticipation afford|ed &s;uperiour plea&s;ure, like all the enjoy|ments of human life was &s;oon allayed. A momentary gratification was &s;ucceeded by a di&s;tre&s;s, which enfeebles de&s;cription. The &s;atisfaction which beamed from our countenances upon his fir&s;t arrival, was &s;oon di&s;pelled by pen&s;ive care, and de&s;troy|ed by gloomy anxiety. His inquiries af|ter our health in his ab&s;ence, naturally led
<PB N="124" REF="025584_0123_0FCE04901BF43060">
us to relate the incident, which had inter|rupted our plea&s;ures. No &s;ooner was he acquainted with the circum&s;tances, than an alarming change of countenance cloud|ed his brow. The &s;mile of tranquillity re|tired; an unu&s;ual au&s;terity governed every feature of his face. Whence this tran&s;i|tion proceeded, I was at a lo&s;s to deter|mine. Thinking him fatigued, and per|haps un&s;ucce&s;sful in bu&s;ine&s;s, I retired early to bed, hoping in the morning to find him in better &s;pirits. The next day the &s;ame unplea&s;ant look, increa&s;ed my apprehen&s;ions. At breakfa&s;t, he was &s;ilent. I ob&s;erved Lucretia frequently ca&s;t her eyes upon him, which in&s;tantly gli&s;tened with tears. My heart caught the conta|gion; but knowing his unplea&s;ant temper, I concluded &s;ome trivial circum&s;tance had &s;oured his mind, and having made it a rule not to notice his re&s;entments, I a&s;ked no que&s;tions. As &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was over he took his hat and walked out. Mrs. Wilkins appearing uncommonly depre&s;&s;ed, I reque&s;ted &s;he would relieve my mind by evolving the cau&s;e of her anxiety. At this reque&s;t &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears,
<PB N="125" REF="025584_0124_0FCE049373988AB8">
which for &s;ome minutes prevented a reply. At length having overcome, in a degree, the pang of unutterable wretchedne&s;s, by an exertion, &s;he replied, "Jealou&s;y, that bane to dome&s;tic plea&s;ure, has taken po&s;t at every avenue of Mr. Wilkins's heart. Our innocent but unfortunate vi&s;it to Mrs. Drayton, has ca&s;t a veil over pre&s;ent en|joyments, and unle&s;s &s;oon removed, may terminate in mo&s;t de&s;tructive con&s;equen|ces. I have u&s;ed every argument in my power, to calm his mind; but the&s;e are devoid of efficacy, while the eye of rea&s;on is blinded by pa&s;&s;ion. The relation you gave him of your e&s;cape, he &s;ays, is a cor|roborating proof of guilt. To be indebt|ed to &s;uch characters as Doctor May, and Mr. Lee, is at once to be criminal. Nev|er was confidence in a wife &s;o betrayed; never a woman &s;o deceitful. To be at the hou&s;e of &s;o di&s;&s;olute a character, and gallanted by &s;uch debauched rakes, and from a feigned fear, detaining one to pa&s;s the night, evinces a guilt which can never be pardoned. The &s;tory re&s;pecting Caro|line is premeditated; he will not be de|ceived. Little did he think, the letter he

received at Baltimore had &s;uch good foun|dation." The letter! I exclaimed. I re|gret that your plea&s;ures &s;hould be in|terrupted by any plans again&s;t me. Had I known this circum&s;tance, previous to Mr. Wilkins's going out, he &s;hould not have left us, until, if po&s;&s;ible, I had re|moved from his mind, ideas &s;o de&s;tructive to your peace; be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall exert my&s;elf to &s;ooth his pre&s;ent &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>With the mo&s;t &s;olicitous impatience, we waited his return to dinner. An hour after his u&s;ual time had elap&s;ed, we &s;ent to the &s;tore. Mr. Wilkins was not to be found. The day was tedious; Lucretia and my&s;elf were pen&s;ile, between hope and fear. We doubted not, however, that evening would re&s;tore him to our wi&s;hes. In this we were alike deceived. Di&s;tant from friends in who&s;e advice we could con|fide, we knew not what &s;teps to adopt. I could not prevail upon Mrs. Wilkins to go to bed. A contrariety of &s;en&s;ations employed our minds; and a train of &s;ub|&s;equent misfortunes, pre&s;ented to view. Every approaching &s;tep flattered a mo|mentary hope. Tho&s;e alone who are ac|quainted

with &s;imilar &s;orrows, could in any degree realize our di&s;tre&s;s. In this truly wretched &s;ituation, we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal days.</P>
<P>Lucretia, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;ingular benevolence and &s;weetne&s;s of mind, was little &s;hort of di&s;tracted. We could get no information of Mr. Wilkins. A week having elap&s;ed in fruitle&s;s inquiries, I ad|vi&s;ed her to addre&s;s her papa, acquainting him with the unhappy event; but her agi|tation was too great; &s;he could not com|po&s;e her&s;elf, and reque&s;ted I would under|take the painful ta&s;k. I accordingly for|warded him a circum&s;tantial account. Never did I &s;o e&s;&s;entially experience the want of your pre&s;ence, as at this moment. The thick clouds of adver&s;ity &s;u&s;pend every ray of plea&s;ure, but that which re|&s;ults from an approving con&s;cience, and the alleviating &s;ociety of Fanny.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport my|&s;elf, deprived of Maria, under my pre&s;ent afflictions, if I was not ble&s;t with this dear girl. Dejection is &s;trongly depictured upon the countenance of Lucretia, and her mind is wandering; grief preys upon her.</P>

<P>OH! my friend, (for by that &s;acred name I will fondly &s;alute Maria,) could I take you by the hand and lead you to the chamber of Lucretia, the &s;cene would excite your tendere&s;t pity, and your heart bleed for her di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Confined to her bed; her intervals of rea&s;on tran&s;ient; her countenance wild and gha&s;tly. The &s;ight is too affecting: But &s;uch is my friend, and &s;uch the object which calls my whole attention. Fanny has been with me &s;everal days, and prom|i&s;es not to leave me.</P>
<P>I was &s;itting one evening upon the bed|&s;ide of Lucretia, wiping the dewy cheek, and endeavouring to arou&s;e her de&s;pond|ency, when the doctor and his pupil enter|ed the chamber. He inquired her &s;itua|tion; and, leaving &s;ome new pre&s;criptions, withdrew. As Fanny was in the room, I followed him, wi&s;hing to know his mind with regard to Mrs. Wilkins, being greatly
<PB N="130" REF="025584_0129_0FCE049C1C1D76C8">
alarmed at his unexpected vi&s;it, as he had been with her in the afternoon. Ob&s;erving my anxiety, the good old gentleman at once a&s;&s;ured me, "His vi&s;it was not from any apprehen&s;ions of immediate danger; for &s;o long as a fever could be retarded, there was great encouragement:" And taking me by the hand, "It was to you my vi&s;it was intended. An accidental di&s;covery alarms me for your &s;afety. Your recent adventure has been a general &s;ubject of conver&s;ation. Since I was with you, in the cour&s;e of my vi&s;its, entering cautiou&s;|ly the hou&s;e of a patient, who lies extremely ill, I overheard the &s;ervants intimate, the per|&s;on Mrs. Wilkins has in her &s;ervice, is not of the &s;ex her habit denotes, but a man, placed in that capacity, the more effectually to complete your ruin; and that he ad|dre&s;&s;ed a letter to Mr. Wilkins, while at Baltimore, giving &s;uch accounts, as, coin|ciding with your &s;tory, excited that jeal|ou&s;y, which occa&s;ioned him to ab&s;cond. I therefore propo&s;e, that this young gentle|man, under the pretence of Mrs. Wilkins's danger, tarry with you to night, and in the
<PB N="131" REF="025584_0130_0FCE049E5D19CC70">
morning that you remove to &s;ome place bet|ter calculated for your &s;afety and happine&s;s."</P>
<P>Ca&s;t into the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment by the unexpected intelligence, the little fortitude I had flattered my&s;elf I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, was long incapable of compo&s;ing my mind; nor could I articulate my thanks for his friend|&s;hip. The doctor now promi&s;ed to &s;ee me early in the morning, and to afford me every po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and reque&s;t|ing Mr. Gilet not to leave the hou&s;e until he came, took his leave. How indefatiga|ble is Eliza in re&s;entment; and by what unexpected events, does the Deity di&s;clo&s;e the combinations of the wicked.</P>
<P>Fanny, unea&s;y at my unu&s;ual ab&s;ence from Lucretia, came &s;oftly down &s;tairs and entered the parlour unperceived by me, as I &s;at leaning my arm upon the table, hold|ing my handkerchief at my eyes; &s;he came towards me, and gra&s;ping my hand, with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of &s;olicitude, "Caroline," &s;aid &s;he, "let me &s;hare in your affliction; impart your di&s;tre&s;s; acquaint me what new circum&s;tance allays your hap|pine&s;s." I could not &s;peak. Mr. Gilet &s;tepping to the door, pu&s;hed it too, and
<PB N="132" REF="025584_0131_0FCE04A004700838">
returning to her, &s;aid, "A &s;u&s;picion oc|ca&s;ions the pre&s;ent thoughtfulne&s;s of your friend." "It mu&s;t," replied &s;he, "be a well grounded &s;u&s;picion, thus to overcome her fortitude." He then related the circum|&s;tance.</P>
<P>Duty to the di&s;tracted Lucretia, called for my re&s;olution, and I &s;tudied to con|quer the exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations of my brea&s;t; but my reflections were doubly painful, from the in&s;upportable idea of being the innocent cau&s;e of her &s;ufferings. Fanny prevailed upon me to di&s;&s;ipate my tears; and re&s;uming as compo&s;ed a countenance, as I po&s;&s;ibly could, I returned to Lucretia. The anodyne &s;he had taken having produc|ed a &s;leep, &s;he did not notice our entering the chamber. The night was tedious. The hours &s;eemed uncommonly retarded; I was impatient for the return of day; &s;leep was a &s;tranger, and my heart familiar with &s;orrow. Early in the morning, the doctor was with us, and advi&s;ed my &s;end|ing for the partner of Mr. Wilkins; re|&s;igning to his care, the keys, &amp;c. and go|ing him&s;elf to Mrs. Gardiner's, engaged a room for Lucretia. He then &s;ent his car|riage

We at fir&s;t found it difficult to prevail upon her to get up and be dre&s;&s;ed; but fortu|nately in her greate&s;t paroxi&s;ms of dejec|tion, I had not lo&s;t my influence; and &s;he finally &s;ubmitted to my per&s;ua&s;ions.

<P>IN this my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, how do I wi&s;h your much loved &s;ociety, to beguile my grief. Fanny, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of feelings which render her valuable to the children of misfortune, is unwearied in her endeavours to alleviate my mi&s;ery. The &s;oft voice of her friend&s;hip, excites many grateful reflections, in the woe-fraught mind of real &s;orrow: She unites with me her attention in re&s;toring tran|quillity to the di&s;tracted brea&s;t of my dear Lucretia.</P>
<P>My &s;o &s;uddenly quitting the hou&s;e of Mr. Wilkins, prevented the execution of any plans, which the malice of our ene|mies had &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t us. Worlds would not have prevailed upon me, to have remained there, after the information I had received. To think we were calling upon a man! and a man by intere&s;t an enemy to my peace, I recoil at the idea.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="025584_0134_0FCE04A5A0FC0FB0">Since we have been at Mrs. Gardner's, Lucretia has, at intervals, been a little more compo&s;ed. She once a&s;ked me, why I removed her from her own hou&s;e? I replied, to cheer her &s;pirits. "You are kind, Caroline," &s;aid &s;he, "but that is impo&s;&s;ible; my &s;ituation is wor&s;e than death. To &s;uf|fer innocently is indeed hard." This is the mo&s;t connected conver&s;ation I have had with her, &s;ince the week after the unhap|py event took place.</P>
<P>By the next po&s;t, I expect to hear from New-York. In this period of my afflic|tion, fail not to pray for the &s;upport of your friend. The &s;ource of my &s;ufferings is uncommon; and new plans of de&s;truc|tion yet await me. To &s;uffer thus in a &s;tate of &s;eeming bani&s;hment, racks my health, and &s;hatters my re&s;olution. But the tears I &s;hed are not barbed with guilt. This con&s;olation enables me to attend my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed friend. When I con&s;ider how much our characters, and happine&s;s, is in the power of tho&s;e around us, I &s;hudder at every &s;tep I take.

<PB N="136" REF="025584_0135_0FCE04A6C63464E8">
in general, great vivacity, we are led into many little errors, which although they cannot be called errors of the heart, too frequently &s;hade our virtues; nor will the plea of youth, be &s;ufficient to ward off the &s;tigma of imprudence. When I con&s;ider our critical &s;ituation, and the many deli|cate points upon which our reputation is e&s;tabli&s;hed, I tremble for the honour of my &s;ex.</P>
<P>My mind has been filled with conjec|tures, re&s;pecting the deception impo&s;ed upon us, by the &s;ervant Mrs. Wilkins had hired. Is this by the artifice of Eliza? How much &s;hould I dread her re&s;entment! I am indeed alive to fear. Can there, Maria, be a female, &s;o devoid of every requi&s;ite, to render her attractive? I he&s;i|tate, to believe there is &s;uch a character! Yet what di&s;agreeable truths, does our in|crea&s;ing knowledge of human nature un|fold upon us. It is too frequently the ca&s;e, that characters, to a cur&s;ory ob&s;erver, en|dowed with all the virtues requi&s;ite for &s;o|cial happine&s;s, upon an intimate or clo&s;e examination, lo&s;e tho&s;e &s;triking traits, and a&s;&s;ume a contrary appearance, from
<PB N="137" REF="025584_0136_0FCE04A8DE0F6F40">
the varied &s;ituations in which they are placed. How oppo&s;ite is the ra&s;h, impru|dent conduct of Mr. Wilkins, to that calm reflection, that &s;eeming fortitude and pru|dence, which at my fir&s;t acquaintance with him, I believed marked his character. The&s;e were only the &s;hadow of tho&s;e vir|tues, the real po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which con&s;titutes the happine&s;s of man. Had Mr. Wilkins nur&s;ed the&s;e virtues, they would not have abandoned his brea&s;t, at the fir&s;t throb of jealou&s;y, nor have &s;uffered the baleful breath of &s;lander to force him from a de|&s;erving wife, before he had determined up|on a ju&s;t cau&s;e of impeachment. Jealou&s;y is a characteri&s;tic of ignorance. When it becomes an inhabitant of the heart, it turns out rea&s;on, affection is bani&s;hed, and every tender &s;en&s;ation lies dormant. Yes my dear, even love, that &s;un of the dome&s;tic &s;oul, is clouded with the black &s;hades of &s;u&s;picion. If po&s;&s;ible, I mu&s;t era&s;e, the killing recollection of Lucretia's &s;ufferings. Thanks be to heaven, &s;he is at this moment a little compo&s;ed. I will endeavour to amu&s;e her.</P>

Frequently would Mr. Barton &s;eize her hand, and pre&s;|&s;ing it to his lips, exclaim, "Give me but one &s;weet word of con&s;olation&mdash;how bitter my cup of affliction!"</P>
<P>A few hours after the letter Mr. Barton had wrote Mr. Wilkins, was &s;ent on, by ex|pre&s;s, I found a great alteration had tak|en place in Lucretia.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="025584_0144_0FCE04B73048A820">It being near the u&s;ual time her phy&s;i|cian attended her, I waited with the utmo&s;t impatience, nor dared to communicate my fears to her father.</P>
<P>The doctor &s;oon entered the chamber&mdash; I watched his looks, I dreaded the deci&s;ion. But the anxiety of a &s;incere attachment, ea&s;ily leads us from one extreme to anoth|er, and I flattered my&s;elf, from an expre&s;|&s;ion he dropt, I had anticipated the wor&s;t. This feeble dawn of hope, was only the plea&s;ing offspring of the moment, which was &s;oon de&s;troyed, and gave birth to feel|ings inexpre&s;&s;ibly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. Approach|ing the bed I had ju&s;t left, to make room for the doctor, I begged him by no means to deceive me, in regard to the &s;ituation of my friend. "Every pro&s;pect," &s;aid he, "of recovery is lo&s;t, and death, that friend to human wretchedne&s;s, will &s;oon &s;eal her mi&s;ery." At this moment, Mr. Barton en|tered the chamber, having been in an ad|joining room, to obtain, if po&s;&s;ible, a little &s;leep; the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing words vibrated up|on his ears, as he opened the door; he flew to the bed, and &s;eizing the cold hand of the expiring Lucretia, declared, "By all the

agonies which now torture my lovely daugh|ter, by the poignant &s;ufferings of a parent's brea&s;t, I &s;wear, never to &s;uppre&s;s my re&s;ent|ment, until this arm &s;hall &s;acrifice the villain who has thus undone me." Then he&s;itating, he turned to the doctor, "Why," &s;aid he, "am I deprived of every hope?" The mournful voice of an afflicted father, at this in&s;tant rai&s;ed the languid eye of his lovely daughter; and giving him an ex|pre&s;&s;ive look, "My &s;ufferings," &s;aid &s;he, "are nearly clo&s;ed. Caroline, I entreat you, atte&s;t my innocence. My father too! are you a witne&s;s of the &s;cene? My loved, my much loved parent, believe your daughter what &s;he ever was; believe her innocent. I have only one wi&s;h ungratifi|ed." "What is that, my darling child?" &s;aid Mr. Barton, "I am all impatience; pray tell your anxious parent?" "To make Mr. Wilkins &s;en&s;ible of the purity of my mind, of the rectitude of my actions, to &s;eal his reconciliation, with the warm ki&s;s of forgivene&s;s, and quit the world re|&s;igned." She was now exhau&s;ted. Her father pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his lips&mdash;at the in&s;tant &s;he expired; li&s;ping in broken ac|cents,
<PB N="147" REF="025584_0146_0FCE04BADD3470C0">
"Oh my father, your ble&s;&s;ing, I know, attends me. Let your parental re|gards, protect Caroline."</P>
<P>At this gloomy cri&s;is, every turbulent emotion of de&s;pair, di&s;tracted Mr. Barton's mind. "Inhuman Wilkins," &s;aid he, "re|venge &s;hall be mine. With what pangs have you imbittered my life!" At times he &s;tood motionle&s;s, with eyes rivetted up|on the breathle&s;s body. The doctor en|deavoured to prevail upon him, to with|draw. "And will you," &s;aid he, "tear me from all I hold dear? She is my child, my only child; you &s;hall not take me from her."</P>
<P>Mr. Barton remained in the chamber near three hours. Finding him unwilling to leave it, I attempted to retire. "And will you quit a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed parent?" &s;aid he, "Remember you are my adopted daughter. Lucretia bade me love you." Earne&s;tly as I wi&s;hed to withdraw, and much as I need|ed the con&s;oling language of friend&s;hip to a&s;&s;uage my &s;ufferings, my duty compelled me to afford every attention, to the incon|&s;olable Mr. Barton. But all I urged, yielded him no relief.</P>

<P>SUCH an ebon &s;hade ob&s;cures my happine&s;s, and &s;o great is the vacuum in my heart, that I am at a lo&s;s how to ad|dre&s;s my dear Maria. To part with our friends, how &s;evere the ta&s;k! Language how feeble, when u&s;ed to expre&s;s acute &s;en&s;ations! But you need not the repeti|tion of my exigencies to attune your brea&s;t to pity. The dew of friend&s;hip frequent|ly moi&s;tens your cheek, on the recollection of my &s;ufferings&punc; I thank you for this plea&s;ing characteri&s;tic of humanity; let it not in&s;en&s;ibly deprive you of your plea&s;|ures.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to calm Mr. Barton. Bereft of Lucretia&mdash;deprived of his all, he refu&s;es to be comforted. Having never experienced the meliorating influence of that religion, which exhilarates the chri&s;|tian, and enables him to &s;u&s;tain afflictions; he is without that comfort, which can only be derived from its ble&s;&s;ed truths.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="025584_0149_0FCE04C01C2F0AC8">Mr. Wilkins's arrival, I anticipate with the mo&s;t lively di&s;tre&s;s. The &s;tyle in which Mr. Barton addre&s;&s;ed him, was not con&s;o|nant to my feelings. Human nature is more frequently brought to a &s;en&s;e of its errors, by the mild voice of per&s;ua&s;ion, than the har&s;h language of re&s;entment. I fear Mr. Barton will never be &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed, to treat him with propriety. I cannot prevail upon him to eat, or &s;leep. His con&s;tant cry is, "Bring me that mon|&s;ter Wilkins; that &s;candal to humanity." I dread each di&s;tant &s;tep, lea&s;t it &s;hould prove the me&s;&s;enger of his arrival. Twice, &s;ince ye&s;terday, he has locked him&s;elf in the chamber of Lucretia; and for more than an hour refu&s;ed me admittance. My whole attention is confined to him.</P>
<P>The brow of your friend, long contract|ed with &s;orrow, is now marked with inex|pre&s;&s;ible dejection. Since I wrote you ye&s;terday, &s;uch additional di&s;tre&s;&s;es have enveloped me, as even the warm imagina|tion of Maria, cannot paint.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t time &s;ince Lucretia's death, I had prevailed upon Mr. Barton, to throw
<PB N="151" REF="025584_0150_0FCE04C31EA7C740">
him&s;elf upon the bed, in hopes a little &s;leep would better enable him to pay the la&s;t re&s;pects to the memory of his unfor|tunate daughter, who was in the afternoon to be entombed. A melancholy &s;tillne&s;s, encouraged my gloemy reflections. I was feeding upon the remembrance of Lucre|tia's &s;ufferings, when a &s;udden noi&s;e arou&s;|ed me from my reverie. My foreboding heart, in&s;tantly &s;ugge&s;ted the fatal truth. So great was my agitation, it deprived me of my &s;trength. I had not power to ri&s;e from my &s;eat. In a few minutes, I heard the voice of Mr. Wilkins upon the &s;tairs. "In&s;upportable is my &s;ituation!" &s;aid he, "Arrived too late? Lucretia gone!" At the &s;ound of this much loved name, Mr. Barton &s;tarted from the bed, and flying to the door, uttered, as he went out, "Vengeance &s;hall be mine!" I faint|ed. When I came to my&s;elf, I was on the bed; Fanny was bathing my temples; Mrs. Gardner and the girls were in the room; I inquired for Mr. Barton; they replied, he was in the next chamber; I re|que&s;ted, he might be called; they evaded a compliance. Su&s;picious of new diffi|culties,
<PB N="152" REF="025584_0151_0FCE04C4FB4CB5B8">
I aro&s;e, and going towards the door, was prevented, by Fanny, from opening it. "Stop, my dear," &s;aid &s;he, "Mr. Barton will be with you in a few minutes." I will not be detained, &s;aid I, and pre&s;&s;ing by her, hurried down &s;tairs; and entering the parlour, found Mr. Bar|ton reclining in an arm chair. He took no notice of me. Going up to him, and &s;eizing his hand, I entreat you, &s;aid I, to let me know the wor&s;t. Where is Mr. Wil|kins? This name arou&s;ed him. "The villain, the mon&s;ter," replied he, "who, in a fit of jealou&s;y, murdered my only child, is now, I hope, no more. Think not an injured parent could forgive his cruelty. When I heard his voice, I &s;eiz|ed the pi&s;tol, previou&s;ly loaded and con|cealed in my bo&s;om; and as he was enter|ing the chamber, which contains the &s;acred remains of my departed angel, I &s;hot him through the head; and locking the door, ordered the hated object from my &s;ight" The tears of affliction, now mingled with tho&s;e of fear, rolling plentifully from my eyes, deprived me of expre&s;&s;ion. Mrs. Gardner coming into the room, I left her

with Mr. Barton; and going unexpected|ly to Fanny, found her ab&s;orbed in trou|ble. My dear, &s;aid I, Mr. Barton tells me he has &s;hot Mr. Wilkins through the head. Is he really dead? "No," replied &s;he, "the ball having entered his right &s;houl|der is thought to have taken a very dan|gerous direction; but he yet lives." Is he &s;en&s;ible? &s;aid I. I will ha&s;ten to him; let a &s;ervant be di&s;patched to know. Scarce had I done &s;peaking, before Mrs. Gardner called us. We ha&s;tened to her. Mr. Barton was in a fit. With great dif|ficulty they got him up &s;tairs. The doctor was &s;ent for. The fits rapidly increa&s;ed and I was prevented from attending the funeral of Lucretia. Judge my feelings, when the &s;olemn knell vibrated upon my ears, which hurried from my view, forev|er, the &s;incere friend of my youth, at the moment her affectionate father was groan|ing with &s;evere pain. Anxious to con|vince Mr. Wilkins of the innocence of his wife, I was impatient to be with him, that I might improve the fir&s;t interval of his rea|&s;on; but duty detained me with Mr. Bar|ton.

<P>Mr. Barton's fits have &s;ub&s;ided &mdash;they have left him extremely weak&mdash;he &s;ays but little&mdash;when he &s;peaks, it is of Lu|cretia. I &s;ent this morning to inquire af|ter Mr. Wilkins&mdash;the &s;ervant brought word, he was &s;en&s;ele&s;s. Jealou&s;y, thou bane to human happine&s;s, thou de&s;troyer of all my plea&s;ures! How ha&s;t thou &s;ub|verted every fancied gratification! Had it not been for this fatal pa&s;&s;ion, Eliza would not have pur&s;ued me with her re&s;entment, nor Lucretia and Mr. Wilkins been thus wretched.</P>
<P>Fanny tells me it is generally believed, the &s;ervant Mrs. Wilkins had in her hou&s;e, was a man who had formerly lived with Eliza's parents; I &s;u&s;pect the letter Mr. Wilkins received at Baltimore, was from him. That it was a man we had engaged in our &s;ervice, &s;everal circum&s;tances tend to prove; but none more, than his imme|diate flight. Many &s;tories circulating in

this place detrimental to our characters, upon being traced, we find originated with him; yet, fal&s;e as they are, it will be diffi|cult to remove prejudices. There are &s;ome ideas, which, if once entertained of a cha|racter, are ever after believed. This ob|&s;ervation is too generally true, as it regards female reputation. A &s;triking trait of hu|man depravity! But a chain of unfortu|nate events has ha&s;tened our ruin. Our vi&s;it to Mrs. Drayton has been attended with extreme di&s;tre&s;s. Repeating the un|fortunate &s;tory to Mr. Wilkins, from its being connected with tho&s;e loo&s;e characters to whom we were indebted, gave us an ap|pearance of guilt. Let us deduce a moral from the misfortune, and from hence learn, not ra&s;hly to condemn; for although ap|pearances may be&s;peak guilt, full confidence is not always to be placed upon them. Appearances can &s;eldom be the &s;tandard of determining the truth, while deception conceals the motives from which we act. I am called to Mr. Barton.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING my wi&s;h to &s;ubmit to the di&s;pen&s;ations of Prov|idence, with &s;uch rapidity do unfor|tunate circum&s;tances crowd&punc; upon me, that I am frequently ready to relin|qui&s;h every cheri&s;hed idea of re&s;ignation. Affliction has a penetrating power, it &s;earch|es the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the heart, and ev|ery revolving day u&s;hers upon me new di&s;|tre&s;s.</P>
<P>This morning I was &s;uddenly awakened by the nur&s;e at my bed-&s;ide. For heaven's &s;ake, &s;aid I, what now awaits me&mdash;is Mr. Barton wor&s;e? "Mr. Barton, Madam," re|plied &s;he, "is dead." Shocked at this &s;udden information, I &s;prang out of bed, and &s;lip|ping on my clothes, ran into his chamber; the nur&s;e followed. "I went to him," &s;aid &s;he, "to inquire if he wi&s;hed for any thing to take; he appearing to be a&s;leep, and ea&s;ier than I had before ob&s;erved him, I

put my ear, near his mouth, and after li&s;t|ening &s;ome minutes, could not perceive that he drew his breath; alarmed at this, I laid my hand upon his forehead, which in&s;tantly convinced me he was dead." Pray nur&s;e, &s;aid I, call Mrs. Gardner; and flinging my&s;elf into a chair, received a mo|mentary relief from a friendly flood of tears. The family were &s;oon with me. Unmind|ful of my &s;ituation, I &s;till &s;at weeping, even after all the boarders had a&s;&s;embled in the room. In the moments of keen afflic|tion, etiquette and propriety are frequently forgot. Mrs. Gardner and the girls were al&s;o &s;urpri&s;ed, they were as inattentive as my&s;elf; in &s;hort, the mo&s;t painful confu|&s;ion prevailed, when two young gentle|men, who had, I believe, ju&s;t entered the chamber, came to me, and entreated me to retire; remaining with the object, they &s;aid, would only irritate my feelings, and a&s;&s;uring me they would pay every po&s;&s;ible attention to my friend, directed the nur&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in returning to my chamber, and by a hint to the other gentleman, got them down &s;tairs, that I might have an op|portunity to pa&s;s. When I entered my
<PB N="160" REF="025584_0159_0FCE04D457AE06E8">
room, I threw my&s;elf upon the bed, and gave fre&s;h vent to my tears. In a few min|utes Fanny came into my chamber, with a bowl of tea, which &s;he urged me to drink.</P>
<P>Capt. Clark and Capt. Green, &s;he &s;aid, had &s;ent for the doctor, and begged I would command their &s;ervices. After complying with her reque&s;t, &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in dre&s;&s;ing. The doctor now arrived, and I found, by Mrs. Gardner, had pronounced Mr. Bar|ton's death occa&s;ioned by poi&s;on. Upon examining the body, it was extremely &s;welled; and their moving it, &s;oon made him an object unfit for &s;ight. The doctor thinking he might bur&s;t in a few hours, ad|vi&s;ed to his being immediately put into the coffin.</P>
<P>At this dreadful cri&s;is, my rea&s;on &s;eem|ed dormant. I was incapable of doing my duty; and had it not been for tho&s;e young gentlemen to whom I am peculiarly in|debted, though entirely unknown, I &s;hould have been ignorant of every &s;tep nece&s;&s;ary for me to pur&s;ue upon the oc|ca&s;ion, and &s;till more deeply involved Mr. Barton's character in di&s;grace, by adding &s;uicide to murder. It had been given out
<PB N="161" REF="025584_0160_0FCE04D51AB2A7E0">
by the family, that Mr. Barton had made his e&s;cape immediately upon firing at Mr. Wilkins; and this report concealed him from the hands of ju&s;tice. The circum|&s;tances of his death, it was likewi&s;e nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;ecrete. His having been danger|ou&s;ly ill, favoured the idea of a natural di&s;&s;olution. After they had removed him into his coffin, a bottle of ar&s;enic was found under his pillow, which confirmed the &s;u&s;picion. Fanny, like a guardian an|gel, never leaves me. Capt. Clark, &s;he &s;ays, ordered every thing belonging to Mr. Barton, to be locked up, and has taken care of the keys, until I &s;hall be able to at|tend to them.

How does the Deity rai&s;e up new friends, when he deprives us of the &s;upport of tho&s;e with which we had been favoured!</P>
<P>Capt. Clark, although a &s;tranger to me, evinces &s;o much &s;incerity, that I can do no le&s;s than accept his friendly offers. Perhaps you may think me ignorant of the deception of the human heart; but I have &s;uffered too &s;everely, not to have learnt a

<P>THE di&s;tance which &s;eparates me from Maria, and my connexions, has been an additional affliction to me.

<P>SO long have I been accu&s;tomed to hope and fear, it is difficult to dive&s;t my&s;elf of anxiety and care. I &s;till feel, as if &s;ome object demanded my particular attention. I walk to the chamber of Lu|cretia, and enter the door, before I recol|lect &s;he is gone, beyond the reach of my friend&s;hip. Di&s;po&s;ed to indulge my mel|ancholy &s;en&s;ations, I retire to my own apartment; but the a&s;&s;iduity of Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> ever prevents me from gratifying a di&s;po|&s;ition &s;o injurious to my health. She, in a language dictated by an exalted friend&s;hip, prevails upon me to join the family below, who unitedly exert them&s;elves to di&s;pel my gloom. Tho&s;e two gentlemen I have previou&s;ly mentioned, appear de&s;irous to amu&s;e me: They are, I find, officers in the &s;econd United States regiment, and profe&s;s a &s;trong friend&s;hip for each other. Capt. Clark reque&s;ts me to view his friend,
<PB N="168" REF="025584_0167_0FCE04E1DDF8AF08">
"As my friend and brother. He has, Madam," continued he, "ta&s;ted of the cup of misfortune; but his mind is &s;upe|rior to every di&s;honourable idea, and you will ever find him ready to advi&s;e and pro|tect your character and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>This naturally led me to make &s;ome in|quiries re&s;pecting him. "I am gratified," &s;aid, Captain Clark, "at your inclination, to become acquainted with his hi&s;tory. His parents re&s;ide at Halifax, and are people of intere&s;t and character. At the commence|ment of the conte&s;t, between Great Britain and America, a &s;pirit of liberty thrilled in his brea&s;t: He viewed the mea&s;ures pur&s;u|ed again&s;t the Colonies, as tending to de|prive them of their privileges; and relin|qui&s;hing every fond attachment, quitted his native country, that he might rai&s;e his war|like arm, in defence of injured freedom; and taking pa&s;&s;age for Nantucket, from thence he proceeded, by land, to the army, then &s;tationed near Bo&s;ton. His &s;tory gained him the confidence of the general officers, and he &s;hortly received a commi&s;|&s;ion in the army, where he &s;erved to uni|ver&s;al &s;atisfaction, till the clo&s;e of the war.
<PB N="169" REF="025584_0168_0FCE04E4DE971DA0">
By his conduct, he gained the approba|tion of his &s;uperior officers, and the uni|form character of a brave man. His ab|&s;enting him&s;elf from the government under which he lived, and accepting a commi&s;&s;ion from the Americans, enraged his connex|ions, and they totally di&s;carded him. Thrown out of all employment, and de|prived of every expectation from his friends, he was left, at the clo&s;e of the war, with many of his brother officers, de&s;tinate of a &s;upport; and has nece&s;&s;arily expe|rienced great difficulties. The &s;acrifices he made in behalf of the&s;e States at fir&s;t procured him a commi&s;&s;ion; and his inva|riable bravery and coolne&s;s, now call him from private life, again to encounter the dangers of the field; and we are mutually engaged in enli&s;ting troops for the We&s;t|ward."</P>
<P>This little hi&s;tory excited my particular attention. I began to be intere&s;ted in his future fortune; for I freely acknowledge I was not &s;o much plea&s;ed with his per&s;on or addre&s;s, as I was with Captain Clark. Certain prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions ever attend a fir&s;t interview, and we frequently &s;uffer our|&s;elves

to be prejudiced only from appear|ance. Such determinations are, however, incon&s;i&s;tent with our better judgment. Many virtues lie concealed from cur&s;ory ob&s;ervation, which, on intimacy, plea&s;ingly expand to view. Be&s;ides, there are a thou&s;and little incidents which tend to bias the mind, and the female is &s;oon partial to the attention of a plea&s;ing character.</P>

<P>A FEW days &s;ince, I gave you a little hi&s;tory of my friend, Captain Green, and I make no doubt, but the heart of Maria, which is uniformly intere&s;ted for the &s;ons of affliction, experienced a pang, &s;imilar with my own.</P>
<P>If I was plea&s;ed with the attention of Captain Clark, at the moment of intro|duction, I am now doubly attached to him. With the mo&s;t brotherly affec|tion, he anticipates my wi&s;hes, and aims to ward off every painful circum|&s;tance; he has devoted him&s;elf to my &s;er|vice, and di&s;charged all the bills occa&s;ion|ed by Mr. Barton's and Lucretia's &s;ickne&s;s.

<P><PB N="175" REF="025584_0174_0FCE04EFA767FB70">Looking over the pocket book of Mr. Barton, I &s;aw a letter directed to me, which, upon opening, I found contained a will, by the date di&s;covered to have been written the day after Lucretia's death; in which, after bequeathing me a thou&s;and pounds, he divides the re&s;idue of his e&s;tate between his only &s;i&s;ter, a widow in the State of New-York, and her children; leaving the clothes he had with him, his watch, &amp;c. &amp;c. at my di&s;po&s;al.

<P>He has appointed two particular friends in New-York, his executors. I gave the will into the hands of Captain Clark; who, after having it proved and regi&s;tered here, enclo&s;ed and forwarded it, by the po&s;t, to New-York.

<P>FOR &s;everal days, having ob&s;erv|ed a great depre&s;&s;ion upon the counte|nance of Fanny, I re&s;olved, the fir&s;t fa|vourable moment, to acquaint my&s;elf with the cau&s;e. Ye&s;terday morning mi&s;&s;ing her from breakfa&s;t, I inquired of her mamma the rea&s;on: She informed me, her health had been very indifferent for &s;ome time; and that la&s;t night &s;he had experienced an ill turn. As &s;oon as I had breakfa&s;ted, I left the table, and going &s;oftly up &s;tairs, cau|tiou&s;ly opened the chamber door, and found her awake. Having made a few inquiries, I told her my apprehen&s;ions, and begged to know if any new circum&s;tance had taken place to interrupt her happine&s;s. If there has, &s;aid I, you mu&s;t not keep me ignorant. "How benetrating is the eve of Caroline,"

replied &s;he, "that I cannot conceal the &s;ecret &s;entiments of my heart. It is the nece&s;&s;ities of Frederick, which render me thus wretched. Deprived of a hand&s;ome property by the ca&s;ualties of trade, he finds it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport a helple&s;s family, without becoming more deeply involved in difficulties.</P>
<P>"A few weeks &s;ince, he received from an unknown hand, a &s;um &s;ufficient to have di&s;charged his little debts. This unfortu|nately was handed him when Charles was pre&s;ent. Frederick had long owed him a &s;mall debt, and his inflexible par&s;imony, would not &s;uffer him to &s;ee a brother thus providentially relieved. He in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould pay him a great part of what he had received, or he would immediately at|tach his furniture for the debt, and Fred|erick was obliged to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>Humanity, that emblem of an exalted mind, how foreign from a heart character|ized by the mo&s;t &s;ordid avarice! His &s;toic|al indifference to a &s;uffering brother, de|bilitates my health; my plea&s;ures &s;icken, and my eyes are filled with the briny dew of &s;orrow."</P>

If we abound in riches, we are placed above an experimental knowledge of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ities which are in&s;eparable to a &s;tate of poverty, and too often become inattentive ob&s;ervers of human mi&s;ery.

"No," he replied, "I did not."

<P>ALTHOUGH we had ab&s;olutely engaged &s;eats in the &s;tage, and Captain Green had taken leave of us the day before, it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to commence our journey. This di&s;appointment was trifling, compared with the anxiety I experienced for my friend.</P>

<P>For Captain Peters to pledge his <HI>honour that no injury was intended,</HI> and then to pro&s;ti|tute this &s;acred pledge, was an unpardon|able, ignominious deception, far beneath the dignity of a brave and noble mind.

<P>CAPTAIN Clark is yet confined to the hou&s;e. I exert my&s;elf to amu&s;e him; but this is difficult. The gentle|men are early familiarized to bu&s;ine&s;s and amu&s;ement, which call their attention abroad; &s;hort confinements are, to them, almo&s;t in&s;upportable; and a little &s;ickne&s;s, with all their bravery and courage, fre|quently renders them peevi&s;h and impa|tient; while our &s;ex, inured to &s;cenes more tranquil and retired, are le&s;s liable to repine at indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;evere blows my friend has received, his eyes are not de|prived of their u&s;ual lu&s;tre. The&s;e yet &s;peak, in the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive manner, the manly and noble &s;entiments of his &s;oul. I wi&s;h not to pre&s;ent him to you, as a regu|lar beauty, or an elegant form. The&s;e, I am

convinced, will never operate upon your mind; but I will introduce you to a man, who&s;e per&s;on and conduct, has long de&s;ig|nated the &s;oldier; who&s;e bo&s;om glows with genero&s;ity, &s;en&s;ibility, ambition, courage, and honour. In his heart are united &s;ent|iments and feelings which dignify the hu|man mind; qualifications, which will re|commend him to Maria.</P>
<P>For &s;everal days I was greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed, lea&s;t a duel &s;hould terminate the un|happy affair; but ye&s;terday it was &s;ettled through the interpo&s;ition of friends.</P>
<P>The doctor having given it as his opin|ion, that Captain Clark may &s;afely proceed to Philadelphia, I know of no circum&s;tance which can prevent our journey. I am truly impatient to quit a place, where I have experienced &s;o much real &s;orrow. My life has been immer&s;ed in afflictions; but I will endeavour to bani&s;h every corroding idea. Vain cares, and anticipated &s;orrows, &s;hall never prevent the enjoyment of vir|tuous reflections. Plea&s;ure and pain are blended in the events of life; and by the alternate operations of hope and fear, we are prevented from &s;inking into apathy and

<P>WE &s;hould have left this the la&s;t &s;tage, had not Fanny's anxiety for her un|fortunate brother yet detained us.</P>
<P>Agreeably to my promi&s;e, the day pre|vious to our intended departure, I pre&s;ented her the &s;um &s;he had a&s;&s;ured me was &s;uffi|cient for his pre&s;ent relief. This &s;he went in the evening to give him, when &s;he found the family in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. His creditors impatient for the di&s;charge of their debts, had that day made &s;everal attachments; and as Fanny opened the door to enter the hou&s;e, an officer availed him&s;elf of the opportunity to execute another writ: This execution deprived them of every nece&s;&s;ary article. Fanny immediately di&s;patched a me&s;&s;age to her brother, in hopes, by bringing him to wit|ne&s;s his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he might be induced to
<PB N="194" REF="025584_0193_0FCE05105A25F458">
a&s;&s;i&s;t him; but when he came, he ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed the mo&s;t trivial relief. She now took Mrs. Gardner a&s;ide, and pre|&s;ented the bills received from me. Thus being enabled to &s;atisfy pre&s;ent calls, he &s;aved his little remaining furniture, depriv|ed of which, his family could not have continued together. Fanny, overcome by this circum&s;tance, reque&s;ted I would relin|qui&s;h the idea of her accompanying me. To this I could not con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Captain Clark has intere&s;ted him&s;elf in behalf of this child of adver&s;ity; and, in the mo&s;t pathetic language, endeavoured to excite feelings in the brea&s;t of Charles; but without effect. What a heart mu&s;t he po&s;&s;e&s;s, thus to &s;uffer a de&s;erving brother, deprived of health and property, to want even the nece&s;&s;aries of life! Unpardona|ble man! The Deity may not always &s;mile upon your pro&s;perity. Intoxicated with your pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s, you think your&s;elf far beyond the reach of fortune's frown; but remember, you may &s;ink from the pin|icle of affluence, from the mo&s;t elevated &s;ummit of wealth, to the dreary vale of misfortune. And although you are ba&s;k|ing
<PB N="195" REF="025584_0194_0FCE0512DECD19F0">
in the indulgence of all your wi&s;hes, the &s;cene may &s;uddenly change, and pov|erty, with its concomitant mi&s;eries, await you; you may yet drink in full draughts, the gall of di&s;appointment, and largely &s;hare in &s;imilar misfortunes with your af|flicted brother.</P>
<P>Mr. Gardner determines, if he can make &s;ufficient intere&s;t, to obtain a com|mi&s;&s;ion in the army; and to relinqui&s;h all idea of remaining with his family.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution he reluctantly pur&s;ues. His attachment to a family, unable to pro|vide for it&s;elf, renders it painful. Captain Clark has promi&s;ed him his influence; and as Mr. Gardner held a commi&s;&s;ion in the late army, flatters him&s;elf he &s;hall &s;ucceed. Whatever the reflections of his brother may be, with re&s;pect to his unfeeling con|duct, the time, I doubt not, will arrive, when he will retire to the family of his own thoughts, replete with the mo&s;t poig|nant &s;en&s;ations, for having added to the complicated di&s;tre&s;s of a de&s;erving brother.</P>
<P>May the journey of our lives, my dear Maria, be rendered plea&s;ant by the &s;un|&s;hine of pro&s;perity; and while we drink
<PB N="196" REF="025584_0195_0FCDE9EB24946910">

<P>WE have at length arrived in this city. Mrs. Lea&s;on received us with painful, as well as plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations. She had previou&s;ly been acquainted with my affecting &s;tory; and, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;ympathetic heart, &s;hared in my affliction.</P>
<P>Sympathy, my dear, is a plea&s;ing &s;en|timent, implanted in the human brea&s;t, which induces us, if we cannot mitigate, to become momentarily intere&s;ted in the misfortunes of our friends.</P>
<P>Laura welcomed us with a degree of politene&s;s, which, had it been unconnected with a haughty air, would have been ac|ceptable. When I was la&s;t in Philadel|phia, &s;he was ab&s;ent from home. Her countenance is plea&s;ing, but the airs &s;he a&s;&s;umes, are incompatible to her &s;ituation in life. Strongly attached to plea&s;ure and
<PB N="198" REF="025584_0197_0FCE05159A5A9118">
amu&s;ement, rational indulgences cloy her ta&s;te. Di&s;&s;ipation is dangerous: It vi|tiates the mind, and attaches it to a round of amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>The troops in this city have received orders to march in a few days. The &s;pir|its of my friend appear depre&s;&s;ed. He flatters him&s;elf that the formidable ap|pearance of the army will deter the In|dians. Many things concur to excite di&s;|agreeable ideas in my mind. It is my &s;in|cere prayer, that the all-wi&s;e Director of the univer&s;e, may take them into his pecu|liar charge.</P>
<P>Since my arrival, I have received a let|ter from Captain Evremont. He com|plains much of a &s;ilence, I am &s;ure, I have not ob&s;erved; my letters mu&s;t cer|tainly be impeded. There is no gratifica|tion we experience in the ab&s;ence of our friends, &s;uperiour to the plea&s;ure of re|ceiving their letters. It is a delightful &s;ub&s;titute for the lo&s;s of their &s;ociety. Captain Evremont writes me, he is &s;ta|tioned at an advanced po&s;t, a mile di&s;tant from Fort-Pitt. He expre&s;&s;es great impa|tience for the arrival of the troops&punc; but
<PB N="199" REF="025584_0198_0FCE05188D0E3960">
writes, with the mo&s;t &s;anguine enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Captain Clark has, I find, many friends in this city, who are partial to his merits. This is plea&s;ing to me. To have our choice in any point, approved by men of &s;en&s;e, is ever a flattering circum&s;tance, and obliterates from a female mind, every ray of unea&s;ine&s;s, le&s;t her too tender &s;u&s;|ceptibility, had pourtrayed excellencies, which exi&s;ted no where, but in her par|tial imagination. Some of your relations are plea&s;ed to patronize him: They have united their influence with his, in behalf of Mr. Gardner, and have a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. I regret the &s;ad alternative, which obliges him to quit his family for a life &s;o aver&s;e to his wi&s;hes, and which &s;ome &s;mall a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his brother might pre|vent. Surely the Deity has traced the outlines of our duty upon our hearts, which a certain inexpre&s;&s;ible con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s points out to us; yet we frequently &s;tifle feelings &s;o honourary to our natures. Being in ha&s;te, can only add the a&s;&s;uranc|es of my friend&s;hip.</P>

<P>MRS. Lea&s;on tells me, &s;he has received a letter from my aunt Noble, re|que&s;ting to be accommodated at her hou&s;e a few weeks, as &s;he wi&s;hes to make a vi&s;it to Philadelphia: She at fir&s;t he&s;itated a re|ply; but finding me &s;ilent, and that her &s;tay would be &s;hort, &s;he has con&s;ented. Thus I am &s;till to be troubled with the repetition of a &s;tory, long &s;ince hateful. I can bear it with tolerable fortitude in a letter; but to be taken by the hand, and compelled to hear a di&s;ta&s;teful tale, deprives me of all my philo&s;ophy. I am half a mind to fly to the arms of my friend, in who&s;e &s;ociety I am confident I &s;hould re|ceive new gratifications, and who&s;e friend|&s;hip would give me a hearty welcome.</P>
<P>Fanny is much plea&s;ed with this city. It is &s;aid to be one of the mo&s;t beautiful
<PB N="201" REF="025584_0200_0FCE051AD99FEFC0">
America can boa&s;t; but perhaps you may think I carry my ideas of variety rather too far, when I &s;ay, there is a little too much &s;amene&s;s for my ta&s;te. I acknowledge it is uncommon for one, who &s;tyles her&s;elf a citizen, to be impartial; for the place of our birth, generally claims our warme&s;t attachment.</P>
<P>We made a party, a few days &s;ince, to the Falls of Schuylkill, to give Fanny an opportunity of &s;eeing &s;ome of the delight|ful &s;eats. I &s;incerely hope, the journey, and attention to her health, will be of &s;er|vice to her. I am impatient to introduce this dear girl to Maria: She is indeed one of tho&s;e rare plants, &s;eldom to be found in the wilderne&s;s of life. There is an inno|cent expre&s;&s;ion in her countenance, which cannot, like the fading flower of beauty, be dive&s;ted of its charms.</P>
<P>Captain Clark will &s;oon leave us. How many incidents occur to de&s;troy our happi|ne&s;s! The &s;weet &s;en&s;ibility which gives us the true reli&s;h of our joys, frequently in|crea&s;es our weight of &s;uffering. The grat|ification we derive from the &s;ociety of con|genial minds, occa&s;ions the mo&s;t &s;evere re|gret,

It is &s;o &s;eldom we find tho&s;e, who are &s;u&s;ceptible of real friend&s;hip, who are incapable of deception, and who unit|edly po&s;&s;e&s;s the qualifications requi&s;ite for a friend, that &s;uch a prize cannot be &s;uffi|ciently e&s;timated. I know it is the com|mon idea of the world, that "Friend&s;hip with women is &s;i&s;ter to love." But while I would pay a due re&s;pect to their general principles and ob&s;ervations, I mu&s;t take the liberty to deviate from them, when their &s;entiments are incompatible with my own experience. I already di&s;cover your conclu&s;ion, and that you are cla&s;&s;ing Caro|line as a Platonic di&s;ciple: It will not, however, denote her character; although I cannot imagine, as much as the world laugh at this philo&s;opher's ideas of love and friend&s;hip, why we may not e&s;teem an en|lightened mind, without feeling for the per&s;on, that degree of affection which de|nates a peculiar, unde&s;cribable attachment. It is indeed &s;eldom the ca&s;e, that real men|tal abilities are the foundation of a fir&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; external beauty, an accom|pli&s;hed behaviour, or the more captivating

Think not I intend a general reflection, when I add, the art of &s;peaking trifles agreeably, too often proves a de&s;tructive poi&s;on, which terminates the happine&s;s of female life. Daily ob&s;erva|tion demon&s;trates the truth. Nor is an agreeable addre&s;s more likely to deceive our &s;ex, than tho&s;e who claim the boa&s;ted &s;uperiority of prudence, penetration and wi&s;dom. We frequently &s;ee the merchant deceived by his ill placed confidence, and his family involved in complicated wretch|edne&s;s. As I have written a long let|ter, I now feel di&s;po&s;ed to conclude, &mdash;I hear Captain Clark's &s;tep below. Don't be jealous, my dear; my time is equally divided between you; and Maria may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of a liberal portion.</P>

<P>I FEEL di&s;po&s;ed to be dull. My friend marched ye&s;terday for the We&s;tward. My aunt came to town a week before he left us. She has adopted a new plan, by which &s;he means to accompli&s;h a recon|cilement with her hu&s;band. Confining her&s;elf to her chamber, &s;he gives out &s;he is extremely ill, and is continually endeavour|ing to prepare our minds for her approaching death. It is, &s;he &s;ays, impo&s;&s;ible for her to continue long among us; nor can &s;he be ea&s;y to quit the world without being previou&s;ly reconciled to her hu&s;band. To die among &s;trangers, to be buried from a &s;trange hou&s;e, are ideas &s;he cannot &s;up|port. Repeatedly have I been &s;ummoned to her bed-&s;ide to take her la&s;t adieu, and as often commi&s;&s;ioned to tell my uncle his unpardonable conduct had given a cruel

Upon my refu&s;al, &s;he has &s;ent for her favourite, from his family, through whom, it is probable, &s;he will accompli&s;h her purpo&s;e.

<P>MY uncle has, at length, been prevailed upon to vi&s;it his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed wife, who was confined to her bed. She has ef|fected her purpo&s;e.

on being thus relieved; yet I fancy you are a little &s;urpri&s;ed at its taking place &s;o &s;oon; but an artful, determined mind can often get through apparent impo&s;&s;ibil|ities. It would be fortunate for my aunt, was &s;he re&s;olved to be happy; but I be|lieve if &s;he has any reflections, they are replete with di&s;content and wretchedne&s;s. She may perhaps experience a temporary gratification, but this will be &s;hort; new contentions will ari&s;e; and tempers, natu|rally ungovernable, cannot ea&s;ily be re|&s;trained at &s;o advanced a period of life.

<P>In the mo&s;t happy connexions&mdash;in the be&s;t regulated families, many things take place, which &s;hould be cautiou&s;ly conceal|ed from the eye of the world; and the woman who would expo&s;e the faults of her own family, mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a di&s;po&s;ition which &s;hould be &s;everely reprobated.</P>

<P>I AM &s;eriou&s;ly concerned for my friends at the We&s;tward. Parties are daily leaving this city, to join the troops already there. A winter's campaign is alarming. For Fanny's &s;ake, I &s;hall be glad when her brother has left us. The poor girl, is &s;carce able to &s;upport the thought of his leaving her. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a di&s;po&s;ition too tender for her own happine&s;s; and, I veri|ly believe, it occa&s;ions all her ill health.</P>
<P>Laura's haughty behaviour, in &s;everal late in&s;tances, has determined me to pa&s;s a few weeks in the country. Having been from infancy, taught to value her&s;elf upon a pretty face and a genteel per&s;on, &s;he thinks her&s;elf entitled to (unmerited) re&s;|pect from all the boarders; and behaves as if external beauty was an ample com|pen&s;ation for the want of internal merit.
<PB N="214" REF="025584_0213_0FCE053266675450">
She con&s;iders a conde&s;cending di&s;po&s;ition as only nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e who are de&s;titute of the attractive charms of a hand&s;ome face, and believes the &s;tudy of the belles-lettres, only calculated for &s;uch as have no preten&s;ions to beauty. She cannot re|alize, that an accompli&s;hed mind will ren|der happine&s;s durable, when the bloom of youth &s;hall fade, and the tran&s;itory flower &s;hall have wa&s;ted its &s;weets. Nor does &s;he cultivate ideas which will render plea&s;ant the la&s;t &s;tage of exi&s;tence. That &s;tage, when the debilitated mind will look back to its trifling gratifications, with the mo&s;t &s;evere regret; when the want of better reflections, will obtrude the idea of her pa&s;t life, upon her imbittered thoughts. But Fanny is a plea&s;ing con|tra&s;t. She has caught from the refulgent beams of wi&s;dom, rays, which will adorn her character, and will render her, at every period of life, an entertaining, agreeable companion. Her heart expands for the unfortunate. "For each one's woes, &s;he has a tear."</P>
<P>I am interrupted; but believe me, my dear, the friend&s;hip of Maria, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a peculiar power of di&s;pelling the gloomy cares of</P>

<P>YOUR cou&s;in has arrived&mdash;he is &s;o altered by an uniform, I did not know him; but when he handed me a letter, which he &s;aid was from Maria, I recogniz|ed his countenance, and introduced him to Mrs. Lea&s;on, Laura and Fanny; to the la&s;t, as my particular friend. I view|ed him, my dear, with all tho&s;e plea&s;ing ideas, which re&s;ult from the con&s;ideration he is your cou&s;in.&mdash;I am &s;orry you think me too &s;evere upon my own &s;ex. You are deceived in your conclu&s;ions. The ob&s;ervations I made, as you advance in life, you will find to be ju&s;t. I meant not to deviate from the &s;tricte&s;t principles of philanthropy or good humour; and the traits I have drawn, are perfectly con&s;o|nant to many characters. If Maria is at pre&s;ent more happy in her companions and
<PB N="216" REF="025584_0215_0FCE0535F0573E80">
friends, I heartily rejoice; but give me leave to remind you, that a knowledge of hu|man nature, can only be learnt by expe|rience; and that in&s;incerity and deception too often characterize mankind.</P>
<P>I ye&s;terday received an invitation to pa&s;s the afternoon and evening with my aunt Noble. Fanny was too depre&s;&s;ed with the pro&s;pect of parting with her broth|er to give us her company. The natural vivacity of her di&s;po&s;ition, withers at the recollection of his misfortunes. The idea of his &s;ufferings, &s;harpens the arrows of her affliction.</P>
<P>I went early to Colonel Noble's, that I might have an opportunity to conver&s;e a little with my aunt. Upon entering the doors, &s;everal new pieces of furniture, caught my attention. My aunt is not without her ambition, any more than the Colonel. I found her alone; congratu|lated her upon her return, and hoped &s;he enjoyed all that happine&s;s &s;he had imagin|ed. "While my property la&s;ts," &s;aid &s;he, "it may do, but the little I have, will never provide for a family. At pre&s;ent, there is not an article brought into the
<PB N="217" REF="025584_0216_0FCE053758F04700">
hou&s;e, but at my expen&s;e." We were now interrupted by company; for &s;he had given large invitations to her acquaintance for the celebration of this plea&s;ing event. Tea and cards preceded an elegant &s;up|per, prepared by this fooli&s;h woman, who&s;e circum&s;tances rather call for the &s;tricte&s;t economy, than allow of the &s;malle&s;t profu&s;ion. For my own part, I know no minor, who &s;tands more in need of a guardian, than my aunt Noble. A prodigal di&s;po&s;ition, is far from evincing a liberal mind; in any &s;ituation of life, it is to be avoided. The indulgence of it hurries us into a thou&s;and evtravagancies, which will finally be de&s;tructive to our happine&s;s. Her di&s;po&s;ition, united with the Colonel's, who&s;e predominant pa&s;&s;ions are &s;how and parade, would &s;oon exhau&s;t an exten&s;ive fortune. My uncle is not, however, &s;ingular in his fal&s;e ideas of greatne&s;s. There are many who will not deny them&s;elves the &s;uperfluities of life, although the butcher and trade&s;man, are continually dunning at the door.</P>
<P>I left my aunt's, di&s;gu&s;ted at her impru|dent
<PB N="218" REF="025584_0217_0FCE0539E7358578">
conduct, and much di&s;plea&s;ed at that violent fondne&s;s they expre&s;s for each other. It is unnatural to believe &s;uch cruel &s;tabs, and recent wounds, have not cankered the mind. But if they po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch heaven-born tempers as totally to for|get the pa&s;t, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, prudence would dictate to them to conceal the vio|lence of their affections. To &s;ee a couple continually fondling and ki&s;&s;ing in compa|ny, is di&s;gu&s;ting, and cau&s;es in my brea&s;t &s;u&s;picions of their conjugal felicity; not that I would di&s;courage that plea&s;ing, af|fectionate attention, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the happy pair.</P>
<P>Mr. Lee yet continues in Philadelphia. Being with him, excites contending pa&s;|&s;ions. While the &s;prouts of gratitude &s;hoot forth with luxuriance, memory awakens the painful remembrance of Lu|cretia's &s;ufferings. Mrs. Lea&s;on tells me, he has been &s;ome years married to a young lady in Bri&s;tol, whom he now di&s;owns as his wife. I &s;hall endeavour to inform my|&s;elf of this circum&s;tance, when I vi&s;it that place. I am impatient to enjoy a &s;hort time the plea&s;ures of &s;olitude. My

<P>CAPTAIN Gardner with his par|ty left this city ye&s;terday. Your cou&s;in expects to &s;tay with us but a few days. He has introduced a particular friend of his to our acquaintance&mdash;a General Hill. This gentleman is, I find, married. I pity his good lady. The army will do better for &s;ingle, than married men. Was I a wife, I &s;hould never con&s;ent to my hu&s;|band's commencing &s;oldier.</P>
<P>I am not a little jealous Capt. Bel|mour has an attachment for Fanny. Mrs. Lea&s;on has propo&s;ed &s;everal matches for this dear girl. One young gentleman &s;he repre&s;ents as deeply in love with her; and ye&s;terday &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;ked me if I thought &s;he could not be prevailed upon to receive his addre&s;&s;es? Not by my interce&s;&s;ion,

replied I, and ha&s;tily left the room. This good lady grows more attached to dre&s;s. Her hair is craped and curled in the high|e&s;t ta&s;te. Could I procure a London doll, marked with the wrinkles of old age, I would dre&s;s it by my landlady, as a pattern to your mamma. This attachment to dre&s;s, frequently places her in a ridiculous light. It injures the reputation of the &s;ex, by enforcing the idea of our vanity, and e&s;tabli&s;hing the illnatured ob&s;ervations of the world, depreciates us with men of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I am deceived, if Laura does not envy Fanny the attentions of Mr. Belmour. Your cou&s;in is indeed, hand&s;ome; but a uniform, my dear, is a great addition. It is truly an attractive magnet with the <HI>fe|male</HI> eye.</P>
<P>Fanny has received a letter from her mamma, which mentions, that a number of Captain Gardner's friends, had opened a &s;ub&s;cription, for the relief of her &s;i&s;ter, who they wi&s;hed to place in &s;ome little bu|&s;ine&s;s, which &s;hould enable her to provide for her&s;elf and children.

He knows not the luxury which re&s;ults from having le&s;&s;ened human wretchedne&s;s. Philanthropy and benevolence are not the characteri&s;tics of his heart. But &s;ympathetic minds, enjoy plea&s;ures with which the&s;e &s;ordid beings are unacquainted. They pa&s;s through life with the &s;weet reflection, of having relieved the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and at the clo&s;e of exi&s;tence, derive a &s;ource of &s;atisfaction from the grateful recollection. I am flat|tered with the idea of your pa&s;&s;ing the approaching winter in this city; and am &s;orry you po&s;tpone coming &s;o long. Urge your mamma to &s;et an earlier day.

<P>AGREEABLY to the promi&s;e in my la&s;t, I have forwarded the hi&s;tory of Mrs. Little. It &s;hall be clothed in her own expre&s;&s;ions&mdash;receive it as I had it from her.</P>
<P>"An unfortunate connexion, has de|&s;troyed my fond ideas of happine&s;s. At the age of &s;eventeen, I was, after a court|&s;hip of two years, united with a Mr. Lit|tle, then twenty-two. He was a foreigner, who had re&s;ided &s;ome years among us. My parents and friends unanimou&s;ly ap|proved the match, and my juvenile fancy planned many happy &s;cenes.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="025584_0228_0FCDE9F9116AC938">"Being an only daughter, my wi&s;hes were ever &s;uper&s;eded by the attentions of my doating parents, and I flattered my&s;elf long to enjoy the pre&s;ent current of unal|layed felicity. But the morning which ri&s;es with the cleare&s;t hemi&s;phere, is often ob&s;cured by a &s;tormy &s;ky. An unexpected circum&s;tance &s;oon pre&s;ented, which oblig|ed Mr. Little to cro&s;s the &s;eas. The voy|age was &s;hort. I had no idea of a &s;epara|tion, for more than a few months. With impatience I waited the period of his ex|pected arrival&mdash;I chid the dilatory hours&mdash;Time appeared to pau&s;e&mdash;I enjoyed no plea&s;ures&mdash;I &s;hared in no amu&s;ements; the anticipation of his return, engro&s;&s;ed my whole attention. At length, the ve&s;|&s;el in which he &s;ailed, arrive. My broth|er ha&s;tened to meet him. In imagina|tion, I was rai&s;ed to the &s;ummit of happi|ne&s;s. I believed uninterrupted plea&s;ures, would crown &s;ucceeding days. But the chilling fro&s;t of di&s;appointment, bla&s;ted my vi&s;ionary joys. Mr. Little was left be|hind. Not a &s;ingle line did I receive from him, nor could any information be obtained of him; he having left the i&s;land from which
<PB N="5" REF="025584_0229_0FCE054973FF2840">
the ve&s;&s;el came. Notwith&s;tanding this, little did my un&s;u&s;pecting heart, forebode his villainous intentions. Educated in re|tired life, I was unacquainted with the de|ceptions of the <HI>beau monde.</HI> Never having been accu&s;tomed to di&s;appointments, it was at fir&s;t a le&s;&s;on difficult to learn.</P>
<P>"In this &s;ituation, I pa&s;&s;ed four years; when my father received a letter from a friend in South-Carolina, acquainting him, Mr. Little lived in Charle&s;ton, with a woman to whom, it was reported, he was married. The contents of this letter, I ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to credit. For more than two years, I re&s;olved not to li&s;ten to the calumniating breath of the world; when the arrival of a particular friend from Carolina, opened my deluded eyes. Fortunately I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great re&s;olution. Yet, having to combat with a warm attach|ment, and all the pains of neglected affec|tion, I was attacked with a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ill|ne&s;s, which confined me &s;ome months to my chamber. During this time, I had many intervals of hope that Mr. Little might yet return, repenting his pa&s;t conduct; till at length; having hackneyed every plea, which
<PB N="6" REF="025584_0230_0FCE054AFAC79F68">
affection, duty, and benevolence could &s;ugge&s;t, I determined to rea&s;on my&s;elf in|to a di&s;po&s;ition, to relinqui&s;h him forever. This was a trying undertaking; but his conduct rendered it nece&s;&s;ary. I now re|que&s;ted his name might never again, be mentioned to me, that, if po&s;&s;ible, I might obliterate him from remembrance. Ble&s;t with indulgent parents, who have &s;tudied to make me happy, I have been enabled to abide by my re&s;olution; or probably, be|fore this, I &s;hould have ended my days.</P>
<P>"Accu&s;tomed to a country life, I have devoted much time to reading: This at|tachment is &s;trengthened by affliction. Thus have I given you a detail of my un|happy &s;ituation. That I have given up every idea, of a man who had thus tran&s;|ferred his affections; who had forfeited the grateful title of my protector and friend, who had proved him&s;elf my &s;educer; my greate&s;t enemy, will not, I feel a&s;&s;ured, prejudice your mind again&s;t me. For, be|lieve me, my heart &s;hed its deare&s;t drops; and had not fortitude &s;hielded me with the helmet of per&s;everance, I &s;hould have relap&s;ed into former unbelief, But by

her influence, and the con&s;ideration of having done my duty, I ri&s;e &s;uperior to my fate. I make no animadver&s;ions upon the conduct of Mr. Little, not doubting, although I have &s;uffered thus &s;everely, you are more acquainted with the villainy of the world than my&s;elf."</P>
<P>What a hi&s;tory is the above. It veils my plea&s;urable ideas: It unfolds to view a conduct, which, for the honour of human nature, I could wi&s;h, concealed. But how frequently do our &s;ex become wretched, by the deep laid plans of wick|ed minds! When &s;uch in&s;tances &s;hade the characters of youth, they mu&s;t tend to de|&s;troy our confidence in a &s;ex de&s;igned, by heaven, for our protection. And while they awaken our &s;u&s;picions, &s;hould im|pre&s;s us with a caution, nece&s;&s;ary to guard our reputation and honour, from the con|cealed plans of the ba&s;e libertine, who de|lights in the mo&s;t villainous &s;eductions, and who frequently &s;elects the mo&s;t virtu|ous of our &s;ex for de&s;truction. Di&s;gui&s;ing his &s;entiments by virtuous intentions, he &s;ecures the affections of the object he aims to ruin; and having bla&s;ted the un&s;ullied

<P>BEING upon a vi&s;it, a few days &s;ince, to Mrs. Little, I took the opportu|nity of making &s;ome inquiries concerning Mr. Lee; ob&s;erving, various reports were circulating in Philadelphia. Upon my a&s;king if he really had a wife in that place, &s;he begged leave to introduce me to her aunt Watts, who could gratify my curio&s;i|ty re&s;pecting her cou&s;in. Having no idea I was among the friends of this unfortu|nate woman; I felt di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, le&s;t I had, unintentionally, injured their feelings; and made many apologies for my unguard|ed conduct. I had awakened the remem|brance of many painful circum&s;tances; and a &s;ilence of &s;ome minutes followed my imprudence. The thrilling tear, having relieved the acutene&s;s of fir&s;t emotions, Mrs. Watts reque&s;ted to know "If I had

any acquaintance with Mr. Lee?" I told her I had boarded, &s;ome time, in the hou&s;e with him. "You &s;hall then," &s;aid &s;he, "be informed, the true circum&s;tances of my dear Harriot's &s;eduction.</P>
<P>"My niece was left in infancy, an or|phan. In humanity to her tender years, I took her under my protection. It was not in my power to educate her in gay life, but I neglected not to in&s;til virtuous principles upon her mind; and &s;he re|ceived the common in&s;tructions of a coun|try &s;chool. The e&s;tate of her father being rendered in&s;olvent, &s;he depended entirely upon her character for a &s;ettlement in life. Her con&s;titution was &s;lender, and inade|quate to the common offices of a country living.

with her, and we believed his intentions honourable. Unfortunately for the dear girl, &s;he now lo&s;t her uncle. Soon after this, Mr. Lee propo&s;ed marriage, and with my con&s;ent, a day was fixed for the wedding.</P>
<P>"A few days after the la&s;t publication had taken place, he urged her to accompany him to Philadelphia. As I wi&s;hed her to purcha&s;e a few articles for her&s;elf, I joined in his reque&s;t, little thinking I was acceding to her ruin. He had not rode far, when he propo&s;ed they &s;hould be married <HI>before they returned</HI> from Philadelphia. Harriot, knowing of no ob&s;tacles, agreed to the wi&s;hes of Mr. Lee; and, in the evening, the cere|mony was, as &s;he believed, performed. Upon their return, he introduced her to me as his wife; nor did I once &s;u&s;pect the fraud.</P>
<P>"Mr. Lee's bu&s;ine&s;s calling him to Phi|ladelphia, and Harriot's health rendering it nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould re&s;ide in the coun|try, &s;he never left me; and from this time, for three years, he uniformly vi&s;ited her &s;everal times a week. But he now began
<PB N="12" REF="025584_0236_0FCE0556D83599F0">
to neglect her, and abroad denied the mar|riage; and to avoid our inquiries, finally left Philadelphia for Maryland. I fre|quently addre&s;&s;ed him by letter, but receiv|ed no reply. At length I wrote to a friend in Philadelphia for the character of Mr. Lee, who, affected with my &s;tory, made me a vi&s;it, and revealed his villainous decep|tions; a&s;&s;uring me, that the ceremony was performed by an abandoned rake, dre&s;&s;ed for that purpo&s;e: That the hou&s;e to which he carried Harriot, was kept by a woman of ill fame; and that the company, to which &s;he was introduced, were the mo&s;t profligate of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>"Knowing the tenderne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;i|tion, I thought it be&s;t to draw her off from him by degrees, and took every opportuni|ty to in&s;inuate, that &s;he would never &s;ee him again; but &s;he could not be per&s;uaded to entertain ideas incompatible with his hon|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"></P>
<P>"Two years after this, as &s;he was &s;itting at her window, &s;he &s;aw him pa&s;s in the &s;tage &mdash;upon which &s;he fainted. Upon her recov|ery &s;he ob&s;erved that &s;he mu&s;t now relin|qui&s;h every idea &s;he had entertained of Mr.

<P>YESTERDAY a billet was handed me from Mrs. Watts, reque&s;ting to &s;ee me. I ha&s;tened to comply with the invitation. When I reached the hou&s;e, I &s;ent my name to her. She hurried down &s;tairs, apologized for the liberty &s;he had taken, and ob&s;erving it was the wi&s;h of her niece to &s;ee an acquaintance of Mr. Lee's, and viewing it as one of her la&s;t reque&s;ts, &s;he cho&s;e to gratify her. I a&s;&s;ured her it would be plea&s;ing to me to afford any &s;at|isfaction to her or Harriot. "The unfor|tunate girl," &s;aid &s;he, "can remain but a few hours&mdash;every &s;ymptom of di&s;&s;olving nature fa&s;t approaches; but I will go and acquaint her, you are below."</P>
<P>In a few minutes &s;he returned, and I followed her to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing chamber.
<PB N="16" REF="025584_0240_0FCE055F23151C10">
Upon her opening the door, every object filled me with horror. The &s;hutters were clo&s;ed. At the &s;ight of the emaciated, heart-broken afflicted girl, bol&s;tered up in her bed, my re&s;olution left me, and I was &s;eized with a faintne&s;s. I had recour&s;e to my &s;melling bottle; and &s;eating my&s;elf at her &s;ide, &s;he appeared to be dozing. "Harriot," &s;aid her aunt, "this is Mi&s;s Francis, whom you wi&s;hed to &s;ee." Look|ing at me with an eye, which was &s;unk deep in its &s;ocket, and extending her hand with a feeble voice &s;he could ju&s;t articulate, "The goodne&s;s of your heart will excu&s;e my inclination. I wi&s;hed to &s;ee you, that you might acquaint Mr. Lee with what I &s;hall intru&s;t to you; that you, who was a &s;tranger to me in former life, &s;hould witne&s;s my dying words; and that in the&s;e all-important moments, I de|clare him to be <HI>my hu&s;band.</HI> Tell him from me, the time will come, when that &s;ilent monitor, con&s;cience, will be true to its tru&s;t.

be deprived of their charms; and though the grave will have buried my &s;ufferings, he will con&s;ider him&s;elf as the di&s;turber of my peace, the de&s;troyer of my health, and the &s;hortner of my days; but not the cor|rupter of my heart. Though I have been rendered wretched by his villainy, my in|nocence is un&s;ullied." Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for breath, &s;he was &s;ome time unable to pro|ceed. When a little recovered, &s;he con|tinued, "Painful recollections do not im|bitter the clo&s;e of my days; and well would it be for my &s;educer, if his retro|&s;pections were alike plea&s;ing; but happi|ne&s;s is too &s;trongly cemented with virtue to be his companion.

<P>Her di&s;order would not &s;uffer her to &s;ay more. I &s;at &s;ome time by her &s;ide; it growing late, I was induced to retire; and promi&s;ing to &s;ee her in the morning, I took my leave of the affecting &s;cene. Early the

<P>I HAVE again returned to the noi&s;y city. Fanny is much better. Her phy&s;ician advi&s;ed to opening a vein. This has been twice repeated within a few days.</P>

<P>I ALMOST regret the day which gave me birth; as I &s;eem de&s;tined to make wretched every family in which I re&s;ide.</P>
<P>Since my la&s;t, by Major Holmes, a circum|&s;tance truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing has taken place. In that, I acquainted you of my promi&s;e to attend Mrs. Lea&s;on and Laura to the theatre. Judge, Maria, my feelings, when I found my&s;elf in the adjoining box to Eliza. By her expre&s;&s;ive countenance, I was convinced &s;he noticed me; and from what I had experienced, doubted not her imagination was engaged, inventing new &s;chemes again&s;t me. Upon each wri&s;t, I per|ceived a bracelet; and by a light which was near her, di&s;covered that one was the picture of the unfortunate Clarimont; the other, a repre&s;entation of that rural retreat
<PB N="22" REF="025584_0246_0FCE056C22398920">
which proved the introduction to all my misfortunes. <HI>Philoclea</HI> was the tragedy performed this evening. It was a play to which I was partial; but having &s;everely experienced the vindictive di&s;po&s;ition of this unhappy woman, I could not dive&s;t my&s;elf of many fears, which forced them|&s;elves upon me, and ob&s;cured the whole en|tertainment. The letter, which I informed you I had received from a per&s;on unknown, &s;hould have prevented my imprudence in thus venturing into a croud. I wi&s;hed to tell Mrs. Lea&s;on my di&s;covery, but was too clo&s;ely watched by Eliza. When the play was over, I begged Laura not to be in ha&s;te. Mr. Hart, the gentleman who had e&s;corted us thither, waited upon Mrs. Lea&s;on and my&s;elf to the carriage, and a gentleman who &s;at in the &s;ame box with us, reque&s;ted the honour of attending Laura; who, fond of attention, and un|&s;u&s;picious of any plans again&s;t me, accept|ed his offer: The crowd &s;oon &s;eparated us. We waited at the door a con&s;iderable time for her, until her mamma, think|ing &s;he had taken another carriage, de&s;ired
<PB N="23" REF="025584_0247_0FCE056D5B00D780">
our driver to ha&s;ten home; but different ideas ru&s;hed upon my mind; ideas I dar|ed not avow. When we reached the hou&s;e, Laura had not arrived. Mrs. Lea&s;on go|ing up &s;tairs to undre&s;s, I took the oppor|tunity to tell Mr. Hart my fears; who in|&s;tantly walked out in &s;earch of her. Fan|ny, previous to our return, had retired to bed. When Mrs. Lea&s;on came down, finding her daughter yet ab&s;ent, &s;he began to be alarmed. The other boarders &s;oon came in; Mrs. Lea&s;on acquainting them with the circum&s;tance, they immediately agreed to take different routs, and enjoin it upon the city watch to patrol the &s;treets, and &s;top all per&s;ons pa&s;&s;ing through the night. I was now left to afford all the con&s;olation, and to encourage all the hopes an imagination inexpre&s;&s;ibly agitated could &s;ugge&s;t. A degree of delirium &s;eized her unhappy mother. The &s;luices of maternal grief were opened, and &s;orrow, like a pe&s;ti|lential exhalation, corrupted every plea&s;|ure. In this di&s;tre&s;s we counted the &s;ilent hours of night, and when the day beamed its rays upon us, the gentlemen returned,
<PB N="24" REF="025584_0248_0FCE05704C617AB8">
but un&s;ucce&s;sful. At this period, every pro&s;pect of Laura's recovery was ob&s;cured.</P>
<P>It was now nece&s;&s;ary to communicate the painful information to Fanny. This, if po&s;&s;ible, I would have avoided; for misfor|tunes are doubly barbed, when directed at the bo&s;om of &s;en&s;ibility and &s;ympathy; and the&s;e were among the darling virtues which &s;hone con&s;picuous in the bo&s;om of my friend.</P>
<P>This dear girl, di&s;covering the &s;ituation of my mind, commanded her own &s;en&s;a|tions. Her di&s;po&s;ition is indeed uncom|monly &s;erene. The mild virtues of philo|&s;ophy are implanted in her brea&s;t.</P>
<P>The gentlemen having refre&s;hed them|&s;elves, renewed their &s;earch. Mrs. Lea&s;on's mind, like barren winter, pre&s;ented nought but dreary pro&s;pects. Were I to attempt a de&s;cription of my &s;ufferings, through th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> day, it would fall infinitely &s;hort of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">|ality.</P>
<P>In the evening it was agreed, by a num|ber of Laura's friends, to form &s;everal par|ties, and watch certain &s;u&s;picious hou&s;es, without the limits of the city, concluding
<PB N="25" REF="025584_0249_0FCE0571DF414C08">
it probable &s;he might have been carried to one of the&s;e for the pre&s;ent. They accord|ingly, at an early hour, took their appointed po&s;ts.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lea&s;on had refu&s;ed every nouri&s;h|ment, and was now &s;o exhau&s;ted, that we no &s;ooner recovered her from one fainting-fit, than &s;he relap&s;ed into another. Cloth|ed in the &s;able livery of affliction, neither Fanny nor my&s;elf could afford her con&s;o|lation. Between the hours of eleven and twelve a carriage &s;topped at the door. I flew to the head of the &s;tairs to inform my&s;elf if any intelligence was obtained of Laura, when I heard Mr. Hart de&s;ire the &s;ervant to tell Mrs. Lea&s;on, Mi&s;s Laura would &s;oon be at home. Eager to give the plea&s;ing news, I was returning to the cham|ber, but a &s;udden fainting-fit deprived me of my &s;en&s;es, and I fell upon the floor. Fanny, alarmed at the noi&s;e, ran into the entry to di&s;cover the cau&s;e, and calling &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, had me conveyed into the parlour. When I recovered, I ob&s;erved Laura in a chair near me. The friends, who had &s;hared with us in the &s;orrows of
<PB N="26" REF="025584_0250_0FCE057358035E90">
the day, were engaged in comforting her and re&s;toring me; while Fanny, having re|turned to Mrs. Lea&s;on, was a&s;&s;uring her of her daughter's &s;afety.</P>

<P>THE meeting between Laura and her mamma, was a real picture of affec|tion and gratitude. It was an inexpre&s;&s;ibly plea&s;ing event, in which words were u&s;e|le&s;s. In this in&s;tance the &s;ilent, but com|prehen&s;ive language of the eye, the en|dearing demon&s;trations of reciprocal joy, evinced in their conduct, declared their real feelings, better than the mo&s;t &s;tudied ex|pre&s;&s;ions. I was impatient to become ac|quainted with her &s;tory; but the confu&s;ion of the family prevented my wi&s;hes until the next day, when Mr. Hart gave me the circum&s;tances of her recovery as follows: "Being concealed within view of the hou&s;e, to which we imagined &s;he might have been carried, we remained without any di&s;covery until after ten, when a carriage
<PB N="28" REF="025584_0252_0FCE05771B67D2C8">
&s;topped at the door. We now walked up to it; and ju&s;t as they had forced Laura out of the door of the hou&s;e, a pi&s;tol I had in my hand, accidentally went off, at which the hor&s;es took fright; and tho&s;e who had hold of her, in&s;tantly fled; while my&s;elf and party, ran to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It was for &s;ome time, impo&s;&s;ible to convince her that &s;he was under the protection of her friends; nor has &s;he given us any account of her being carried away." Thus far gratified, I was obliged to wait, until Lau|ra was &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed to acquaint us with the manner of her being carried off. When &s;he a&s;&s;ured her mamma, &s;he was hurried through the croud, and handed into a carriage, by a gentleman who &s;at in the box with us, who accompanied her to the place from which &s;he was re&s;cued by Mr. Hart. Here &s;he was confined to a chamber, and attended by a woman, from whom &s;he learnt, that &s;he was to be removed further into the country the next night; and mu&s;t take her final leave of Philadel|phia. She repeatedly a&s;ked, why &s;he was thus torn from all her friends? but could obtain no an&s;wer. In the evening &s;he was
<PB N="29" REF="025584_0253_0FCE05789B1B6460">
told a coach was come to take her from this place, and &s;he was immediately hurri|ed down &s;tairs to the door from whence, as above related, &s;he was re&s;cued by Mr. Hart.</P>
<P>This affair has given a fre&s;h &s;tab to my enjoyments. It deprive me of the &s;atis|faction I flattered my&s;elf to have received from the &s;ociety of my friends. I feel a la&s;&s;itude I cannot de&s;cribe. The anxiety of Mrs. Lea&s;on and Laura has produc|ed fevers, which at pre&s;ent run high. It will require &s;ome time for them to recover their health. I am de&s;tined to the &s;evere&s;t trials&mdash;continually involving my friends in affliction. The idea &s;aps every promi&s;ed plea&s;ure; and I find their anticipation a chimera. May your friend|&s;hip animate my heart&mdash;be to Caroline a Mentor, who, recalling her wandering thoughts, &s;hall remind her, that although philo&s;ophy directs us to fortitude, religion is the only &s;upport in the &s;torms of life.</P>

<P>MRS. Lea&s;on and Laura are better.</P>
<P>This recent affair, has determined me never again to venture in public. I am at times di&s;po&s;ed to retire to &s;ome un|frequented &s;pot, and by a&s;&s;uming a differ|ent habit and name, endeavour to live un|di&s;turbed in ob&s;curity. Fanny is urgent for me to take the advice of my friends, with re&s;pect to &s;ecuring Eliza. But I have no proof again&s;t her, unle&s;s the letter to me, after Clarimont's death, will be accept|ed as &s;uch. I intend, however, to write to Captain Evremont for his advice. My pre&s;ent &s;ituation is critical. I have no friends in Philadelphia, who&s;e duty it is to protect me; and fear is viewed as the child
<PB N="31" REF="025584_0255_0FCE057CA11BA1B8">
of guilt. But why &s;hould all my happi|ne&s;s be &s;acrificed to the jealous di&s;po&s;ition of a di&s;appointed woman, who is certainly the &s;ource of my misfortunes?</P>
<P>A letter is this moment handed me from Captain Evremont. It contains the cer|tain accounts of my cou&s;in's having fallen a victim to &s;avage ferocity, in&s;tead of his being killed at the defeat of Major Wil|lys. This intelligence he has received &s;everal ways. Yattacheu, a friendly In|dian, who has been &s;everal days at Fort-Pitt, has given the mo&s;t direct information, of his being burnt by &s;low fires, near the Miami villages. This &s;tory is corroborat|ed by a pri&s;oner lately returned to camp, who was taken in the &s;ame defeat; but for|tunately obtained his ran&s;om, through the interpo&s;ition of a gentleman trading among them, who formerly lived in the &s;ame town with him.</P>
<P>What hope do I encourage, which is not de&s;troyed by the breath of di&s;appoint|ment? Every object recals the tortured body to my view; my heart is warped

with the mo&s;t tenebrous ideas, and mi&s;|fortune awaits me upon every &s;ide. Our friends &s;trongly attach us to life. To part with them is painful&mdash;but to part with them, by the aggravated tortures of &s;avage invention, is an in&s;upportable reflection. May I not, in this ca&s;e, &s;ay, "Memory thou &s;ting!" Providence has prepared a double portion of affliction for your friend. Frequently doth the big drop, bur&s;t from my eye. But I will watch every murmur|ing thought.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame conveyance is handed me a letter from Captain Clark; a copy of which I &s;hall enclo&s;e to you; not becau&s;e it contains any particular information, but the &s;tyle in which it is dictated, I am &s;en&s;i|ble, will be grateful to my friend.

<P>The deranged &s;tate of the army &s;ince my arrival at Fort-Pitt, has alone prevent|ed me from commencing a corre&s;pondence &s;o flattering to my vanity; and by which I &s;hall receive the communications of a &s;en&s;i|bility, tempered by judgment, matured by ob&s;ervation, and heightened by the en|dearing information of the welfare of many friends, I e&s;teem in Philadelphia. Captain Evremont had almo&s;t di&s;couraged me from writing, by reading me a paragraph in one of your letters, wherein you expre&s;s a great degree of diffidence in regard to addre&s;&s;ing me, and beg him to intercede for you.</P>
<P>I have frequently been favoured with the peru&s;al of detached parts of your let|ters to him, and think my friend Caroline mu&s;t be <HI>unpardonably diffident</HI> of her own
<PB N="34" REF="025584_0258_0FCE05831FE34CB0">
abilities, or &s;uppo&s;e me mo&s;t <HI>con&s;ummately</HI> vain of mine; to expre&s;s a wi&s;h, that I &s;hould overlook faults, if any exi&s;t, beyond my comprehen&s;ion; and which I am not &s;ufficiently acquainted with language to critici&s;e.</P>
<P>You ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, in your la&s;t letter to the Captain, "That many a man who wears the uniform and cockade, cannot reconcile the idea of parting with his friends, and commencing citizen of the world." I confe&s;s there are &s;ituations in life, more grateful to my feelings, and in which I could be happier. I am, howev|er, ble&s;t with a di&s;po&s;ition for a military life, which will ever lead my inclination to a parallel with my duty. Your remarks al&s;o, re&s;pecting the uniform and cockade, are unhappily too true. The female mind <HI>delighted</HI> by <HI>appearances,</HI> too often betrays the heart into error, mi&s;ery and ruin. "<HI>Encircled as we are with friends, who&s;e ideas and wi&s;hes are corre&s;pondent with our own, you fancy no circum&s;tance can allay our happine&s;s. "In their &s;ociety,"</HI> you add, "<HI>no</HI> plebeian <HI>principles intrude; but every</HI> lord <HI>may exerci&s;e his full authority, and receive his

wonted &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. A fine &s;chool for de&s;pot|i&s;m!</HI>" Your ideas are erroneous. For my&s;elf, I am indeed &s;en&s;ibly impre&s;&s;ed with the very honourable &s;tation in which I am placed, I <HI>feel</HI> like a <HI>&s;oldier,</HI> but I <HI>feel</HI> like his <HI>friend.</HI> "<HI>De&s;poti&s;m</HI>" will never be a boding feature in my character, although there are "<HI>Plebeians</HI>" who&s;e <HI>principles</HI> are not con&s;onant to mine, and who&s;e ideas are too contemptible for my approbation.</P>
<P>Several Indians have been admitted to private conference with the General, and the &s;uperior officers to a knowledge of their bu&s;ine&s;s to which my rank does not entitle me.</P>
<P>It is thought by the army that we &s;hall leave this place as &s;oon as the expected troops arrive. Tell Fanny her brother came into camp ye&s;terday, in good health, and de|&s;ires to be remembered to you both.</P>
<P>That my friends &s;hould be thus particu|lar in the a&s;&s;urances of their e&s;teem, flatters me much: They may be a&s;&s;ured, that my heart mo&s;t <HI>&s;en&s;ibly</HI> accords with my wi&s;hes for their happine&s;s. Tender them, in return, my warme&s;t acknowledg|ments.</P>

<P>MANY things concur to render me unhappy. The expo&s;ed &s;ituation of my friends at the We&s;tward&mdash;Being my&s;elf without a protector, Fanny's ill health, and the melancholy certainty of my cou&s;in's tortures, are alone ample cau&s;es of anxiety and pain. Our happine&s;s through life, Maria, is unavoidably connected with that of our friends. Captain Clark's letter, ex|pre&s;&s;es &s;uch unmerited encomiums, that I have regretted &s;ending it to you. But you mu&s;t remember, my dear, it is a tenet of the gentlemen, that they cannot render them&s;elves agreeable to our &s;ex, unle&s;s they &s;acrifice their &s;incerity at the &s;hrine of flat|tery. This is indeed the le&s;&s;on they have received, from that celebrated courtier, Lord Che&s;terfield, according to who&s;e

ideas, no "<HI>Compliment is too gro&s;s for the fe|male ear.</HI>" Although his lord&s;hip, in this ob&s;ervation, confined the gratefulne&s;s of flattery to the "<HI>Female ear,</HI>" he was him|&s;elf convinced, it was a language plea&s;ing to human nature, and &s;trictly ob&s;erved it, upon all occa&s;ions. It would, however, be a plea&s;ing idea, if this &s;entiment was not, in connexion with others, ruinous to the morals of &s;ociety. When I read his letters, I regret, a book &s;o fatal to the hap|pine&s;s of the community, &s;o replete with poi&s;on to the youthful mind, &s;hould ever have been publi&s;hed. In youth the imag|ination is warm, the pa&s;&s;ions &s;trong, and without incitement, they are prone to err. Lord Che&s;terfield's accompli&s;hments, if a character practi&s;ed in deception, and edu|cated in intrigue, can be &s;tyled <HI>accompli&s;hed,</HI> could never be &s;ub&s;tituted for tho&s;e virtues, in which he was mo&s;t &s;trikingly deficient. His in&s;tructing his &s;on in the arts of &s;e|duction and adultery, is an error which can never be approved, by the mo&s;t licen|tious and depraved.</P>

<P>CAPTAIN Clark's letter di&s;cov|ers a depre&s;&s;ion which gives me pain; but he is not the only friend compelled to pur|&s;ue a mode of life, derogatory to his wi&s;h|es. The unfortunate Mr. Gardner, has al&s;o been obliged to relinqui&s;h the &s;ociety of a beloved wife; to tear him&s;elf from the engaging prattle of his infant children; to quit a home, which might have been rendered peaceful and happy, had the brea&s;t of his brother, been filled with that &s;ympathy, which is an ornament to hu|manity. But there are my&s;teries in Provi|dence, which human wi&s;dom cannot re|veal; and we frequently &s;ee one brother loaded with a redundance of fortune's gifts, devoid of a &s;oul to relieve another, equally de&s;erving, who experiences the mo&s;t di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing wants.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="025584_0265_0FCE0590A3475388">The mi&s;er, what a &s;ordid worm! Full of anxiety, he pur&s;ues his &s;peculations; he eats the bread of carefulne&s;s; he &s;mothers every &s;park of benevolence; his character is &s;haded by inhumanity; and his name becomes odious, even to his friends.</P>
<P>I have received a morning's vi&s;it from my aunt Noble. She had been &s;hopping, and has purcha&s;ed a variety of finery. While &s;he has a copper left, it will be im|po&s;&s;ible for her to re&s;train her prodigal di&s;|po&s;ition. I inquired if my uncle was likely to get bu&s;ine&s;s? She replied, there was no pro&s;pect of it at pre&s;ent, and that &s;he &s;oon expected to want the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Strange woman&punc; thought I, that with &s;uch ideas can be thus indi&s;creet. She acquainted me with a &s;ecret, which &s;he determines to keep inviolate; but I will pledge my word, if &s;he &s;hould, it will be the fir&s;t that ever &s;he kept in her life. Nay, could I trace her to the hou&s;es &s;he has vi&s;ited this morning, I dare a&s;&s;ert, I &s;hould find it already communicated to every family.</P>

<P>This great &s;ecret was told before Mrs. Lea&s;on, Laura and Fanny. Her vi&s;it was &s;hort, con&s;equently the more agreeable to her niece. She had to call at &s;everal places; and if by accident &s;he &s;hould fall into com|pany with intire &s;trangers to her, or her &s;ituation, I would forfeit half I po&s;&s;e&s;s in the world, if &s;he did not acquaint them with all her grievances.</P>
<P>I find my aunt's tears of irritability are yet at command. The weakne&s;s of her conduct has created her many enemies: She has made her&s;elf the deri&s;ion of the city. Many who wi&s;h her well, in ju&s;tice to them&s;elves, are obliged to withdraw from her &s;ociety: For however mankind are di&s;po&s;ed to befriend the unfortunate, they are &s;oon wearied with a recital of com|plaints; and the le&s;s we proclaim our cares and troubles abroad, the more we &s;hall be

The journey of life is &s;hort&mdash;and it is folly to mar pre&s;ent enjoyment, by a rehear&s;al of evils, or to pur&s;ue objects as nece&s;&s;ary to our happine&s;s, which lie far beyond our reach; and which, if we have the good fortune to attain, &s;till leave us far di&s;tant from felicity.

<P>It is frequently the ca&s;e, that the very periods, which we were &s;o impatient &s;hould arrive, reach us without the power to &s;atisfy, or we &s;oon become &s;atiated with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

<P>I HAVE the plea&s;ure to congrat|ulate my dear Maria, upon the arrival of her brother, from the We&s;t-Indies. Mo&s;t feelingly do I wi&s;h to add, the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of his health; but although he en|joys a greater &s;hare, than when he left Philadelphia, he is yet an invalid. Mrs. Lea&s;on and Laura are &s;o far recovered as to be below. Fanny is at pre&s;ent better; but I fear the di&s;order will finally &s;ettle upon her&mdash;&s;uch repeated attacks mu&s;t e&s;|&s;entially weaken her con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I la&s;t week, made one of a large party to your aunt. She is indeed, an <HI>amiable, &s;en&s;ible,</HI> and <HI>accompli&s;hed woman.</HI> Having ever been accu&s;tomed to the &s;tyle in which &s;he now lives, &s;he is free from tho&s;e &s;uper|cilious airs, which many of our <HI>pre&s;ent gen|try
<PB N="46" REF="025584_0270_0FCE0598FA4D2008">
a&s;&s;ume.</HI> In her family is the &s;tricte&s;t regularity. Liberality is here &s;een without profu&s;ion&mdash;Grandeur without o&s;tentation.</P>
<P>Mr. P. is a man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of talents, which would reflect &s;uperior honour upon him, if he would con&s;ent to fill the <HI>vacancy</HI> in <HI>government,</HI> to which he has been <HI>appoint|ed</HI>; but having declined the <HI>repeated wi&s;hes</HI> of his country, it is his determination to clo&s;e his days in private life. He is indeed ju&s;tly e&s;teemed for the &s;olidity of his un|der&s;tanding, his unblemi&s;hed integrity, and the virtues of his heart.</P>
<P>Here I was introduced to a Mrs. Wil|liams, a lady, with who&s;e character I have long been acquainted, and I have no doubt but public fame has al&s;o given it to Maria; but lea&s;t you &s;hould in this re&s;pect be <HI>&s;in|gularly</HI> ignorant, I will acquaint you. She is originally from New-England; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;triking levity of di&s;po&s;ition, which, with an exce&s;&s;ive vanity, leads her to a conduct that renders her di&s;re&s;pected. For &s;everal years pa&s;t, &s;he has been con|ver&s;ant with the etiquette of the polite world, and lives in a &s;tyle, few Americans
<PB N="47" REF="025584_0271_0FCE059A584E80F0">
will attempt to imitate. Her whole &s;tudy is, to &s;urpa&s;s the gay circle in which, like the gaudy butterfly, &s;he flutters, to di&s;play her variegated colours, and peculiar rich|ne&s;s of apparel.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation &s;he ob&s;erv|ed, "It gave her great plea&s;ure to antici|pate the time, when a proper di&s;tinction would be paid to the characters of the rich and elevated; for the pre&s;ent equality was horribly mortifying. It is now im|po&s;&s;ible to obtain any article of dre&s;s which is not immediately copied by the vulgar. A few weeks &s;ince I ordered my milliner to make a hat in the newe&s;t and mo&s;t ele|gant ta&s;te. Agreeably to my directions it was &s;uperbly decorated, and I thought the price it co&s;t would prevent imitation; but the &s;econd time I wore it. I was mortified to find Mrs. B. with one exactly re&s;embling it; and going home, I committed my own to the flames."</P>
<P>This <HI>noble</HI> lady is united with a man, who, by the mo&s;t fortuitous events, has gained an elevated office, and the moment|ary breath of popularity. But although
<PB N="48" REF="025584_0272_0FCE059CB64FC730">
&s;he at pre&s;ent ba&s;ks in the indulgence of her con&s;ummate arrogance; yet high as her hu&s;band has been rai&s;ed to honour, and bountifully as his country has provided for him, the provi&s;ion will fall infinitely &s;hort of the calls of a woman who has no bounds to her extravagance.</P>
<P>From the ob&s;ervations I made upon her conduct, during the afternoon and evening, I am convinced, this motto may be affixed to her arms, "<HI>a &s;hort life and a merry one.</HI>" She has forgot the times that are pa&s;t, when the occupation of her hu&s;band placed her in a &s;phere of life, far different from that in which &s;he now moves; &s;he is al&s;o un|mindful, that, by the voice of the people, he came into political exi&s;tence; and that the &s;ame voice can deprive him of his hon|ours, and return him to that ma&s;s of "<HI>Vul|gar Citizens</HI>" from which he &s;prang. Her conduct is cen&s;ured, even by her friends; but fancying her&s;elf beyond the reach of envy, &s;he "<HI>Bids defiance to the low a&s;per&s;ions of plebeian calumny,</HI>" and pur&s;ues her fav|ourite plea&s;ures. Mr. Williams, bewilder|ed with her ideas of greatne&s;s, which &s;he
<PB N="49" REF="025584_0273_0FCE059E19D6BF00">
lineally inherits, appears equally intoxi|cated.</P>
<P>In this uncertain tide of her pro&s;perity, it would &s;urely be friendly, to remind her &s;he may fall, and again commence the wife of a <HI>plebeian.</HI> But I believe &s;he con|&s;iders reflection, as too laborious an em|ployment for a fa&s;hionable mind. Convinc|ed that you will excu&s;e my deviating from my own &s;tory, I &s;hall ever feel at liberty to communicate &s;uch as occur to me; and while they tend to unfold the vanity of the human heart, I flatter my&s;elf they will not be unacceptable to Maria.</P>

<P>A FEW days &s;ince, Fanny re|ceived a letter from her &s;i&s;ter Gardner, ac|quainting her with the late &s;everity of her brother: Who no &s;ooner &s;aw this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed woman, placed by her friends in a &s;itua|tion, which they flattered them&s;elves, would enable her to &s;upply the calls of an infant family, than he made a pre&s;&s;ing de|mand, for what his brother owed him, and has finally obliged her to give him her obligation, to pay him weekly, a certain proportion, until both principal and inter|e&s;t &s;hall be di&s;charged. And having late|ly come into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e &s;he now occupies, he has greatly added to her rent, and requires indubitable bond&s;men for her punctual payment of it. La Bru|yer's ob&s;ervation, when &s;peaking of char|acters &s;imilar to Mr. Gardner, is certain|ly
<PB N="51" REF="025584_0275_0FCE05A22AF2BC58">
verified. "They are neither," &s;ays he, "fit for friends, citizens, nor chri&s;tians. If you admit them any merit, it is becau&s;e they have money."</P>
<P>The unfeeling mind, is unacquainted with tho&s;e &s;ublime emotions, which digni|fy the benevolent heart. Your brother, who&s;e brea&s;t yields to every tender call of humanity, was pre&s;ent when Fanny open|ed the letter. He watched her counte|nance, di&s;covered her unea&s;ine&s;s, and urg|ed to be acquainted with the cau&s;e. In vain did &s;he attempt to conceal her &s;orrow; his curio&s;ity was not to be evaded; and &s;ubmitting to his entreaties, &s;he gave me the letter, and left the room. I hand|ed it to him. No &s;ooner was he ac|quainted with the contents, than he ad|dre&s;&s;ed a letter to Mrs. Gardner, in which he enclo&s;ed the mortgage of a hou&s;e in Havre-de-Grace, begging her acceptance of it; with permi&s;&s;ion to draw upon him, for the &s;um nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;charge Mr. Gardner's debt. An act of genero&s;ity this, which doubly endears him to my heart. Ble&s;t with a fortune which enables
<PB N="52" REF="025584_0276_0FCE05A35E0CFE40">
him to indulge his philanthropic wi&s;hes, he is indefatigable in pur&s;uit of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed objects. And con&s;idering him&s;elf re&s;pon|&s;ible to the Deity, for the property he has be&s;towed upon him, he believes it his duty to le&s;&s;en the wants of the afflicted. I am convinced it is a grateful reflection to your mind, that tho&s;e virtues, for which your decea&s;ed <HI>father</HI> was &s;o ju&s;tly revered, are tran&s;mitted to his <HI>only &s;on</HI>; and that in the brother, the parent yet lives.</P>
<P>Left early in life an heir to &s;uch immen&s;e property, great was the danger which en|compa&s;&s;ed him; but ble&s;t with a religious education, he was armed again&s;t the in|citements of the world; and viewing vir|tue as the only road to happine&s;s, he di&s;|regarded the vanities of life. Free from the o&s;tentation of youth, he holds exter|nal pomp as u&s;ele&s;s; making it his endeav|our to alleviate human &s;orrow; his health will not permit his per&s;onal attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, but the mercantile connexion he formed immediately after his father's death, renders his attendance unnece&s;&s;ary. His lib|erality to the Univer&s;ity at Rhode-I&s;land, of which he is a <HI>member,</HI> united with his
<PB N="53" REF="025584_0277_0FCE05A4D98900A8">
many public and private acts of charity, render him con&s;picuou&s;ly beloved. Uni|form in his di&s;po&s;ition to do good, he vi&s;|its the humble dwelling of poverty, and privately affords his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; while num|bers are relieved by his benificence, who know not, from whence the bounty flows.</P>
<P>How different is the di&s;po&s;ition of Mr. Belmour, from the general characteri&s;tic of the world, who are &s;eldom affected with a di&s;tant view of misfortunes.

<P>BY a letter received by the po&s;t this evening, from Capt. Evremont, I find, he had drawn twenty days provi&s;ion, and was to leave Pitt&s;burg, for Fort-Wa&s;hing|ton the fifth of September. This fort is three hundred miles from the place where my letter was dated. What an extent of country already &s;eparates us! and what innumerable difficulties mu&s;t the army en|counter, before they return to the wi&s;hes of their friends! Convinced that you will in|dulge me in my moralizing reflections, I &s;hall not apologize for tho&s;e &s;entiments which may flow from my pen, for I cannot avoid being thoughtful upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.

<P>FANNY lately received a letter from her mamma, by a Mr. Gibbins, whom &s;he wi&s;hed Mrs. Lea&s;on to accommodate with lodgings; but the hou&s;e was then &s;o full of boarders, it was not in her power to entertain him. This gentleman is nearly &s;ixty years old, and a widower with a large fortune; he has, however, been our con|&s;tant vi&s;itor; and I &s;incerely believe our landlady flattered her&s;elf &s;he had made a conque&s;t; for the whole artillery of her charms have been arranged upon the occa|&s;ion. The barber has been employed to new model her head, and has &s;upplied her with a fal&s;e dre&s;s, which partially conceals the emblem of her age. But a few evenings &s;ince, he made a declaration, by which &s;he di&s;covered it was his intention to per&s;uade &s;ome pretty girl to make him happy: This
<PB N="58" REF="025584_0282_0FCE05ADDC4E0860">
has induced her to relinqui&s;h her fir&s;t in|tention, and to adopt every &s;tratagem, that Laura may become the happy being.</P>
<P>Mr. Gibbins may have been hand&s;ome twenty or thirty years back, though at pre&s;ent no ve&s;tige of beauty remains; and he is one of the mo&s;t illiterate beings I ever heard attempt to &s;peak. But why do I mention the&s;e. <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>age</HI> are not to be con&s;idered, when contra&s;ted with a <HI>for|tune</HI> and <HI>carriage.</HI> This gentleman differs, in many re&s;pects, from his &s;ex: For a lady to have rude health is &s;o <HI>vulgar</HI> he cannot abide it. "There is a certain &s;omething to be expre&s;&s;ed to a &s;ick wife which &s;uits the &s;oftne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition; it gives an affectionate hu&s;band an opportunity to &s;how his regards." A very pretty affection truly, that cannot be evinced, unle&s;s the beloved object is langui&s;hing in a con&s;ump|tion, or tortured with pain!</P>
<P>Mrs. Lea&s;on readily falls in with all his ideas. Her daughter is quite an invalid. She propo&s;es, her making a vi&s;it to Pot&s;|grove: The ride would be of &s;ervice to her health. This is artfully done before
<PB N="59" REF="025584_0283_0FCE05AF59BBA580">
Mr. Gibbins. He begs not to be deprived of Mi&s;s Laura's company. Mrs. Lea&s;on is now highly gratified. She then makes an objection to her going with any of the young boarders; and &s;he cannot po&s;&s;ibly accompany her. Mr. Gibbins reque&s;ts the honour to attend her, and a&s;&s;ures her mam|ma, his chariot and him&s;elf are equally at Mi&s;s Laura's command. I &s;u&s;pect this will end in a connexion; but I am not, I a&s;&s;ure you, envious of Laura's pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>Fanny, your brother and my&s;elf, fre|quently pa&s;s an hour with your aunt P. I never quit her company without regret. More real plea&s;ure re&s;ults from her con|ver&s;ation, than from all the circles of the city. I am delighted with her family government. Heaven has ble&s;t her with a number of children, who, from the cradle, are taught to obey. Indeed every part of her hou&s;e appears to be directed by a me|chanical hand, which moves the whole &s;y&s;|tem in perfect uni&s;on. Mr. P. has added to his family &s;everal little orphans, who being left de&s;titute of property or friends, induced this benevolent man to take them
<PB N="60" REF="025584_0284_0FCE05B21C8EA758">
into his hou&s;e, the&s;e receive the &s;ame ed|ucation with his own children. He de|rives an inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure from the in|dulgence of his beneficent mind. While the &s;elfi&s;h heart, wa&s;tes its days, without ever wiping the tear of affliction from the furrowed cheek of poverty, few partake of the philanthropy of a P. or a Belmour. Was the world more generally governed by their principles, we &s;hould experience a happine&s;s unknown to the pre&s;ent age. We &s;hould not then find one brother com|pelled to go into di&s;tant, and hazardous countries, where he mu&s;t experience in|numerable hard&s;hips, while another con|tinued at home, counting his property, and oppre&s;&s;ing the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>MY aunt was with me a few days &s;ince. "<HI>A new blow,</HI>" &s;he &s;ays, "<HI>is &s;truck at her dome&s;tic peace.</HI>" My uncle has been reflecting upon her for &s;ome of her late imprudencies, and &s;he, as u&s;ual, I &s;up|po&s;e, returned a double &s;hare of invective. She re&s;olves not to continue with him; but is undetermined what &s;teps to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>The connexion between Mr. Gibbins and Laura goes on rapidly. I have taken the liberty to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations to Mrs. Lea&s;on, re&s;pecting the age of her daughter's gallant.

<P>In this in&s;tance, I am &s;ure, money mu&s;t make good great deficiencies. But Mrs. Lea&s;on and Laura are not &s;ingular in their ideas. Strange infatuation! that for the pro&s;pect of wealth, they give up every plea&s;ing expectation of connubial happi|ne&s;s. What can a young lady flatter her|&s;elf, who, in the bloom of youth, is con|nected with a man in the la&s;t &s;tage of life, that is either &s;atiated with the follies and amu&s;ements through which he has pa&s;&s;ed, or who is unable, by the decrepitude of age, to enjoy the gay &s;cenes in which the heart of his wife con&s;tantly partakes. A uniformity of ta&s;te, is an e&s;&s;ential requi|&s;ite to dome&s;tic happine&s;s; and this can never be found in &s;o &s;triking a contra&s;t of years. Would Laura and her mamma, anticipate what mu&s;t take place a &s;hort pe|riod hence, when the concomitant di&s;ea&s;es of advanced life, &s;hall reduce her intended hu&s;band to a &s;econd childhood, they mu&s;t,

<P>MRS. Lea&s;on is truly an artful woman. Her fine&s;&s;e alone will obtain a hu&s;band for Laura. The old gentleman pays her the clo&s;e&s;t attention. She begs that I will not &s;ay any thing to di&s;courage her daughter. I am perfectly &s;ick of his com|pany; although, when he is pre&s;ent, I can|not help &s;miling. The hor&s;es and &s;ervants are already changed; they had neither <HI>&s;orc|ibility</HI> nor <HI>faculty</HI> &s;ufficient for her ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure which the anticipation of this connexion affords Mrs. Lea&s;on, cannot be expre&s;&s;ed. She has long been endeav|ouring to make a match between her daugh|ter and a certain young gentleman in this city, who has been &s;ome time her gallant; but notwith&s;tanding every opportunity &s;he had given him to encourage an infant par|tiality,

<P>Upon the arrival of Mr. Gibbins, Mr. Hill was &s;lighted, as he does not make &s;o great a &s;how. His virtues and good qual|ities are ob&s;cured; real accompli&s;hments are neglected, for imaginary ones. For my own part I have endeavoured to di&s;|cover one plea&s;ing trait in the character of Laura's lover, but have not &s;ucceeded. He may be &s;tyled one of tho&s;e beings, which the world denominates harmle&s;s and in|offen&s;ive; terms, which in my view, de&s;ignate the mo&s;t contemptible character.

<P>WHEN will my fonde&s;t wi&s;hes be gratified? The period I fear is remote. Yet my heart continually a&s;pires after the &s;ociety of my friends. By this time they are in the center of a de&s;art, on all &s;ides liable to be attacked by the bea&s;t of prey, hourly expo&s;ed to the more voracious inhabitants, and continually in danger of that inex|pre&s;&s;ible cruelty, which marks the &s;avage tribes. To enjoyment I am a &s;tranger; but it is unfriendly to increa&s;e the anxiety of Maria. The &s;ame Providence which protects us, in the retired, and le&s;s expo&s;|ed walks of life, can al&s;o &s;creen them in the field of battle. Into the hands of an unerring power we mu&s;t commit them, and may he who &s;ways the &s;ceptre of univer&s;al nature be their con&s;tant protector.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="025584_0291_0FCE05BCDE0A4EC0">A &s;trange affair has taken place in this city. You remember the &s;tory of Henri|etta Carele&s;s, who was &s;uddenly mi&s;&s;ing, and was long &s;ince, &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead. Her friends la&s;t week received a letter from her, which gives the following account.</P>
<P>"Having for &s;ome time, encouraged an attachment to a certain French gentleman, who had re&s;ided &s;everal years in Philadel|phia, &s;he re&s;olved to follow him to his native country; and under&s;tanding that a French family, who &s;ailed &s;oon after him, wi&s;hed a per&s;on to attend them upon their pa&s;&s;age, and take the care of their children; having &s;uitably clothed her&s;elf for the purpo&s;e, &s;he made application to them, and engag|ed in their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>"Soon after their arrival in France, Mon&s;ieur De Lot made a vi&s;it to the fami|ly in which &s;he was, to congratulate them upon their return. Having been intimate with this gentleman in America, &s;he feared he might recal her countenance; but be|ing engaged in accompli&s;hing a piece of needle work for the lady with whom &s;he lived, &s;he endeavoured to command her
<PB N="68" REF="025584_0292_0FCE05BE5F47EB58">
feelings; and learning by their conver&s;a|tion, that he accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to walk &s;ome time after dinner, in the celebrated gardens of Mr. M. an American gentle|man, &s;he re&s;olved the next day to deco|rate her&s;elf in a particular dre&s;s, which had been much admired by him, while in Philadelphia, and to walk in the gardens, about the time &s;he expected he would ap|pear there. She had not been long amu&s;|ing her&s;elf in this delightful &s;pot, before &s;he &s;aw him enter, and &s;oon found &s;he had caught his attention.</P>
<P>"Having followed her &s;ome way, he ha&s;t|ened his &s;tep; and overtaking her, expre&s;|&s;ed great joy from the unexpected meeting, welcomed her to Paris, and begged to know what had brought her from home? She replied, the circum&s;tances of her voyage were &s;ingular, and at pre&s;ent could not be divulged. "You will, however," &s;aid he, "permit me to vi&s;it you, and attend you in public!" She a&s;&s;ured him it was not in her power, at pre&s;ent, to gratify a wi&s;h, in which her heart &s;o largely &s;hared. "You mu&s;t indulge me," &s;aid he, "in vi&s;iting
<PB N="69" REF="025584_0293_0FCE05C1A3BDE700">
you." She a&s;&s;ured him, that could not yet be granted. "Your &s;tory mu&s;t indeed be &s;ingular," &s;aid he, "which induces you thus to &s;eclude your&s;elf from the &s;oci|ety of one, who has long felt his heart glow, with a partiality he cannot conquer. Nothing, my adored Henrietta," continu|ed he, "but an engagement I had, previ|ous to my vi&s;iting America, bound my&s;elf by every tie of honour, to fulfil, would have torn me from you. Con&s;ider me as your protector. Since my return, I feel my&s;elf le&s;s obliged to pur&s;ue an object, who&s;e conduct in my ab&s;ence, has render|ed her di&s;gu&s;tful to me. The three years I pa&s;&s;ed in America, have changed my opin|ion with re&s;pect to the education of my own country women. I have entirely lo&s;t my attachment to that volatile conduct, which in my view borders upon a criminal levity; and I am re&s;olved to obtain an American wife. This declaration determ|ined her to keep inviolate her &s;tory; and as &s;he could not &s;ee him, while &s;he remain|ed in her pre&s;ent capacity at Madam &mdash;'s, &s;he begged he would excu&s;e her being &s;een

by him for a few days; and in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould not attend her from the place where they then were. She did not, how|ever, leave him, without a promi&s;e of meet|ing him in the &s;ame garden in a few days. Being repeatedly &s;een together, various conjectures were excited; and in a &s;hort time it was known, that the American girl who lived with Madam &mdash;, was the per&s;on who met Mon&s;ieur De Lot. The lady with whom &s;he lived, unfortu|nately was connected in the family with which this gentleman had long expected a union; &s;he therefore thought it be&s;t to quit her hou&s;e, and retire to private, but reputable lodgings, where &s;he frequently received the vi&s;its of her lover. Thus they pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal months; when the day was fixed for the wedding, and the next week, &s;he was to have been introduced to his connexions; but having taken his leave of Henrietta one night, later than u&s;ual, &s;he never &s;aw nor heard of him more. Notwith&s;tanding the indefatigable exertions of his friends to recover him, and having pa&s;&s;ed a year in fruitle&s;s inquiries,
<PB N="71" REF="025584_0295_0FCE05C45ABD5258">
&s;he finally re&s;olved to retire to a mona&s;tery, where &s;he has taken the veil, and deter|mines to end her days in a voluntary exile, as bu&s;y life is without enchantments to her. Her brother is preparing to &s;ail in the pack|et for France; if po&s;&s;ible, to prevail upon her to return to the embraces of her im|patient parents.

As my pre&s;ent &s;ituation may prevent my writing more than a few lines at a time, my letter may bear more the appearance of a jour|nal than an epi&s;tle. I &s;hall, however, avail my&s;elf of every opportunity, to give you &s;ome account of our &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I left Pitt&s;burg on Monday, Septem|ber the fifth, in company with three other boats commanded by Captain Evremont, Captain Gardner, and Lieutenant G. Nothing material occurred on our pa&s;&s;age to Mu&s;kingum, except my di&s;covering, by an excellent gla&s;s I had in the boat, men on &s;hore, about two miles a-head, filing off through the bu&s;hes, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, to attack us. We prepared to receive them, and kept our lads at their arms, until we arrived at Mu&s;kingum, which was the &s;ev|enth of September. We paid the compli|ment of the drum, and received a &s;alute from the block-hou&s;e here. At this place
<PB N="75" REF="025584_0299_0FCE05CC996C4918">
I met many of my old acquaintance, who were happy to &s;ee me. I was delighted with the &s;ituation of Marietta, but think the "<HI>Campus Martius,</HI>" derives its princi|pal excellency from its &s;trength again&s;t an Indian, rather than a military enemy. We took our leave of this in a few hours, accompanied by a number of gentlemen who were bound to Belle Pre, and who were &s;o polite as to attend us twenty-five miles beyond that place. I think they paid dear for their gratification, as they had to row back again&s;t a current, which now runs about four and a half knots an hour.</P>
<P>When we came oppo&s;ite the French &s;ettlement of Galliopolis, I was &s;o &s;ick, that I was obliged to &s;end a letter a&s;hore to Captain G. to apologize for my not vi&s;|iting him with my brother officers. The ninth, a large bear &s;wam acro&s;s the river. One of my men jumped into a canoe, but bruin reached the &s;hore before him, and made off. This was the fir&s;t large &s;pecies of game I have &s;een, during my march to Pitt&s;burg, or &s;ail thus far down the river,

except one fawn. The tenth, landed at the famous &s;ettlement of Lime&s;tone. To &s;ay I was di&s;appointed, would give but a &s;mall idea of the place, or my feelings. It is true, the land about it is luxuriantly fertile, and the town is happily &s;ituated; but the hou&s;es, for &s;o old a &s;ettlement, are contemptibly mean and badly built. Mo&s;t of the people are poor and lazy, and the &s;treets abominably filthy and dirty; owing to their hog&s;ties being contiguous to them; and from lazine&s;s, or &s;ome rea&s;on incom|prehen&s;ible to me, their &s;uffering the filth and excrements to run into the &s;treets. Lime&s;tone is &s;ixty miles from Fort-Wa&s;h|ton.</P>
<P>The next place we landed at, was a &s;ettlement called Little Miami. It is in|deed a beautiful &s;ituation, and the peo|ple appear contented and indu&s;trious. Having reached Fort-Wa&s;hington, waited upon General St. Clair. The twelfth, dined with General Harmer; were order|ed to hold our&s;elves in readine&s;s to march at the &s;horte&s;t notice. Thur&s;day, September the fifteenth, ordered to march

Forded two deep creeks during the march; halted at Mill-Creek, ten miles from Fort-Wa&s;h|ington; the road &s;o very muddy our bag|gage could not keep up with us; of con&s;e|quence we were obliged to lay in the woods on a wet piece of ground, without a blanket or great coat, with only thin nankeen over|alls, and a linen jacket.

About twelve at night, a large tree, fell upon two of the &s;oldiers, one of whom died in a &s;hort time; the other was badly wounded.

now &s;ent to reconnoitre, and make a new road into the old one, which was di&s;cov|ered three miles from where we were. Our baggage now came up, and we got &s;omething to eat and drink; it being the fir&s;t time &s;ince the day before. "It is tight times with us, I a&s;&s;ure you."</P>
<P>The &s;eventeenth reached the great Mi|ami. The eighteenth, General St. Clair arrived from Fort-Wa&s;hington. The nine|teenth, &s;everal large rattle-&s;nakes were kill|ed by our men in camp.</P>
<P>I cannot account for the mode in which duty is generally done in this camp; for I conceive it <HI>ab&s;olutely unmilitary:</HI> But as older officers than my&s;elf have done the &s;ame tournament in the game, I acquie&s;ce, though I think it a ridiculous mode; but hope the &s;tyle will be altered, when we move towards the enemy, who, we are in|formed, are fifteen hundred &s;trong, and are determined to give us battle. So be it: Although I am &s;orry our force is not &s;o re&s;pectable in point of &s;trength as num|bers. This day, immediately upon com|ing off my duty, I was ordered to make
<PB N="79" REF="025584_0303_0FCE05D3591DCB58">
out a mu&s;ter-roll, and an in&s;pection-return, again&s;t to-morrow!</P>
<P>Con&s;ideration is one of the fir&s;t prop|erties in my e&s;timation of a good General; but to put an officer upon duty, and, as &s;oon as he comes off, to expect three days bu&s;ine&s;s, with clo&s;e application&punc; to be per|formed in one, is a refinement beyond my comprehen&s;ion! However, what can be, &s;hall be done.</P>
<P>Major H. returned ye&s;terday from Fort-Wa&s;hington, but with &s;mall encour|agement, as to our baggage being forward|ed. This is again&s;t me, as all my &s;tores were left there, and the difficulty of hav|ing them &s;ent to me, naturally increa&s;es with my di&s;tance from them; however, it is nothing uncommon to &s;oldiers, and I mu&s;t and will be contented. This afternoon my boy returned to me from the ho&s;pital at Fort-Wa&s;hington. Poor boy! the &s;cenes are &s;o novel, and, as he conceives, hard, that it affects his &s;pirits, and makes him unhappy. He little thinks what fa|tigues and dangers are yet to come! In|deed, my friend, I anticipate a winter's

campaign, in a country inhabited only by wild bea&s;ts, or the &s;till more ferocious bipeds of the fore&s;t, without baggage, and I very much fear, in a manner without provi&s;ions; as it is clear to my under&s;tand|ing, that the fro&s;t will de&s;troy the herbage of the country, which is the &s;ole depend|ence, at pre&s;ent, of our bat-hor&s;es and cattle! This anticipation, with the re|flection of having no other coverings in our <HI>be&s;t</HI> &s;ituation, but our tents, in the middle of winter; and that when on pic|quet, we &s;hall be allowed no fire, however &s;tormy or cold it may be, I confe&s;s af|fords me but little &s;atisfaction in the con|templation.</P>
<P>The continual rains in this country mu&s;t render it very unhealthy. We have but few dry nights. My tent, bed and clothes are always wet. Frequently do we be&s;tow a <HI>benediction</HI> upon the contractors, for the thinne&s;s of our tents; the backs and doors of which are made of the coar&s;e&s;t oznabrigs, through which it rains as thro' a &s;ieve; thus is the country cheated, and the &s;oldier impo&s;ed upon.</P>

<P>THE tribute of my dear Maria, and her god-mother's benevolence, are duly received. Accept my thanks in be|half of Mrs. Gardner. I &s;hall, by an early opportunity, tran&s;mit this token of your &s;ympathy to her; and feel a&s;&s;ured, it will be received with a grateful heart. By letters lately from her, we learn, that by the &s;everity of Mr. Gardner, &s;everal re|&s;pectable planters in the neighbourhood of Havre-de-Grace, have been reduced to very great di&s;tre&s;s. The &s;ituation of one of the&s;e unfortunate per&s;ons, is indeed afflicting.</P>
<P>Mr. Gardner had long expre&s;&s;ed a particular friend&s;hip for a Mr. Hen&s;haw; he availed him&s;elf of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, and hired of him a &s;um of money, for which
<PB N="83" REF="025584_0307_0FCE05DB4CDA4C68">
he gave a mortgage of his plantation as a &s;ecurity. This property, united with the &s;tock he previou&s;ly owned, enabled him to commence a large &s;peculator; but finally proving unfortunate, and being followed with repeated bad contracts, he found him|&s;elf thou&s;ands wor&s;e than nothing. Mr. Gardner had loaned him the money upon an extravagant intere&s;t, but had given him his honour that he would never di&s;tre&s;s either him or his family for it; nor never &s;uffer them to be turned off from their e&s;tate. But the&s;e promi&s;es were made to a man in affluence, and were never meant to be extended beyond the period of pro&s;|perity. Notwith&s;tanding Mr. Hen&s;haw had received but one half the value of his place, which has &s;ince been appri&s;ed by indifferent people; the other half was &s;hortly &s;wallowed up by the u&s;urious in|tere&s;t which Mr. Gardner demanded; and this unfortunate man, who has an aged father and mother, be&s;ides an exten&s;ive family dependant upon him, is thrown up|on the bounty of his neighbours for a pre&s;|ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This, my dear Maria, is
<PB N="84" REF="025584_0308_0FCE05DC8A3D6DF0">
one among the unnumbered in&s;tances of his barbarity. An amiable, a happy family are at this moment experiencing his inex|orable cruelty; his &s;urpri&s;ing par&s;imony and u&s;ury; and while they view him as the great cau&s;e of their di&s;tre&s;s, are loading him with their &s;evere&s;t reproaches. But though the heart of a Gardner is hardened, and his ears deaf to their di&s;tre&s;s, yet he who reigns above, and views with a ju&s;t abhorrence, his inhuman conduct, will fi|nally &s;hower down his vengeance upon the perpetrator of &s;o cruel a deed. Then will he, who now <HI>thrives</HI> by <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and who views the di&s;tre&s;s of a <HI>brother</HI> and a <HI>friend,</HI> with a heart hardened by a love of wealth, experience that &s;evere remor&s;e of con&s;ci|ence, which he has kindled by a rapacious mind. Then will the anger of an offended Deity roll upon him, and in his moments of angui&s;h he will regret the calamities he has brought upon others. It is the voice of heaven which denounceth woe unto them who heap up wealth in abundance, grinding the face of the poor, con&s;idering not the &s;weat of their brow; but who are rejoicing alone in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>

<P>A FEW evenings &s;ince, the &s;er|vant acquainted me that a per&s;on at the door wi&s;hed to &s;peak with me. I aro&s;e from my chair, and was pa&s;&s;ing into the entry, when Mrs. Lea&s;on bid the boy de|&s;ire them to walk into the parlour and de|liver their me&s;&s;age; but not having any idea of danger, I endeavoured to pa&s;s her; when &s;he caught my hand, and led me back into the room. The boy &s;oon returned with a card, which gave me an invitation to pa&s;s the next evening with your aunt P. Without he&s;itation I returned my compli|ments, and a&s;&s;urances of attending her. When your brother came home, I told him my engagement, and claimed the hon|our of his company. The next day prov|ed &s;tormy; but not inclining to be depriv|ed
<PB N="86" REF="025584_0310_0FCE05E072AD4440">
of &s;ociety to which I am &s;trongly attach|ed, your brother procured a carriage and attended me to his aunt's. From the par|ticular invitation I had received, I expect|ed to find a &s;elect party a&s;&s;embled; but upon my entering the room, di&s;covered we were unexpected, though welcome vi&s;itors. This induced me to apologize for being out &s;o di&s;agreeable an evening; and I a&s;|&s;ured her, my partiality to her company, as well as real politene&s;s, which obliged me to fulfil particular engagements, had alone induced my pre&s;ent vi&s;it. "It is tru|ly," replied &s;he, "an agreeable di&s;appoint|ment, for I anticipated pa&s;&s;ing this even|ing alone, as Mr. P. left the city ye&s;|terday, and will not return this week; I &s;hall therefore claim you as my companion until he arrives. I now began to &s;u&s;pect the card a deception; and taking out my pocket-book, handed it to her, reque&s;ting to know if that was her invitation. She a&s;&s;ured me it was not. This confirmed my imagination, and has again filled me with fears. Watched by &s;o inflexible an enemy as Eliza, my conduct, mu&s;t indeed

be guarded; &s;o great is her art, I cannot develope her in a &s;ingle in&s;tance; although it is evident, &s;he leaves no &s;tratagem une&s;|&s;ayed to complete my de&s;truction. Tho&s;e reflections, however, which re&s;ult from a recognition of my conduct, greatly con|tribute to my happine&s;s. To the&s;e I re|tire with a &s;atisfaction, of which I can never be deprived by the &s;evere&s;t per&s;ecu|tion; they will contribute to my &s;upport. An invariable attachment to virtue, and a &s;trict adherence to duty, will, notwith|&s;tanding the misfortunes we meet, facili|tate the journey of life. Self-approbation, greatly contributes to our enjoyment; nor can we be deprived of a tranquil and hap|py mind, while we reverence the dictates of con&s;cience. <HI>Do as thou would be done unto,</HI> is a precept which &s;hould early be impre&s;&s;|ed upon the heart; and they, who&s;e actions coincide with this copy will en&s;ure a per|manent reward. While I continued at Mrs. P's. a billet was handed me from my aunt Noble, which was written, as &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;es, <HI>from her bed of &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s.</HI> This begged my immediate attendance up|on

her: But being convinced it was noth|ing more than a return of her old di&s;order, I felt no inclination to hurry my&s;elf; and accordingly deferred my vi&s;it until the af|ternoon; when going to the hou&s;e, I found her below, and at her favourite amu&s;ement, cards. This was, however, a matter of no &s;urpri&s;e to me, for I had fre|quently known her while at Trenton, to keep her bed, &s;end for her mini&s;ter and doctor, and in le&s;s than an hour after they had left her, come down &s;tairs, apparently in her u&s;ual health, and devote the whole day to the card-table. She pleads in ex|cu&s;e for this indulgence, her indi&s;po&s;ition and difficulties; and to &s;mooth the brow of a gloomy imagination, plunges deep in|to error; nor does &s;he ever enjoy her&s;elf but in cea&s;ing to be rea&s;onable; for &s;uch tho&s;e &s;urely are, who can never be happy but when thus employed. The Deity has, undoubtedly&punc; de&s;igned us mutually to contribute to the happine&s;s of each other; and the love of &s;ociety is &s;trongly imprint|ed upon our hearts. It is a tie, which properly enjoyed, leads to the mo&s;t refined

plea&s;ures. By this &s;ocial intercour&s;e, our ideas become enlarged, the torch of know|ledge is lighted, and we derive a gratifica|tion, &s;uperior to every idle amu&s;ement. But that mind mu&s;t indeed be peculiarly vacant, which can never be at ea&s;e, unle&s;s engaged in &s;cenes of di&s;&s;ipation; we re|quire &s;ome moments for reflection which we cannot enjoy in a round of company.</P>

<P>THE anxiety I experience for my friends, prevents me from partaking in that current of happine&s;s, which is now overflowing the ambitious imagination of Mrs. Lea&s;on and Laura, from the antici|pated connexion with Mr. Gibbins. Yet notwith&s;tanding my painful &s;en&s;ations, I am obliged to decorate my expre&s;&s;ions in the livery of gaiety, to di&s;&s;emble my feel|ings however difficult the undertaking. Deception in this re&s;pect, is a double duty which I owe to the friend&s;hip and health of Fanny; but it is impo&s;&s;ible always to conceal my feelings, and &s;he frequently di&s;covers the unea&s;ine&s;s of my heart. Her &s;olicitous friend&s;hip, adds a jewel to her virtues, and reflects redoubled lu&s;tre upon her actions. I keep, as far as po&s;&s;ible, ev|ery painful event from her knowledge, and

There being an e&s;tabli&s;h|ed po&s;t, from this place to Pitt&s;burg, we often have an opportunity of hearing from our friends, though &s;everal weeks have elap&s;ed &s;ince we received any information. This cau&s;es the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ideas to haunt my imagination. Forgive me, Maria, if I indulge a gloomy propen&s;ity.

<P>This city is full of mirth and di&s;&s;ipation, yet I cannot become intere&s;ted in the plea&s;|ures which encircle me. Fatal premoni|tions deprive me of even the comforts of hope; but I will not trouble you with the gloom of my heart.</P>

<P>YOUR la&s;t letter, while it evinces your friend&s;hip, I confe&s;s gives me pain, by the di&s;covery of your anxiety. You mu&s;t not &s;uffer the &s;ituation of a &s;oldier to impede your happine&s;s. Captain Green, upon his return from Fort-Wa&s;hington, told me he had given our letters to a di&s;patch which left that &s;ort for Pitt&s;burg; from thence they will be immediately forwarded to Philadelphia, by my friend Mr. T. I wi&s;h this letter could picture to you a more agreeable pro&s;pect than my la&s;t; but my anticipation in that, re&s;pecting the pea vine, our principal dependence for the &s;upport of our hor&s;es, &amp;c. and all the herbage of the country, except long &s;our gra&s;s, and decayed leaves, is now cut off: The hor&s;es are enfeebled and die daily; we had only a few bags of flour on hand for the &s;upport of the whole army, until the arrival of the brigade of &s;ixty hor&s;es, with which Captain S. came; and they only brought
<PB N="94" REF="025584_0318_0FCE05EDA0164B60">
three days provi&s;ion. On the road they met a brigade of hor&s;es, which left us three days ago; but the badne&s;s of the road rend|ered &s;till wor&s;e by the heavy rains, had worn the hor&s;es down, and di&s;couraged the pack-hor&s;e ma&s;ters, who, Captain S. in|forms, &s;wear they will not return!</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation in a few days will be critically di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, if Mr. D's agents have no other dependence for the tran&s;portation of provi&s;ion to us than the pre&s;ent &s;et of hor&s;es belonging to the army. Heaven knows the poor creatures cannot bear but little, if any burden; and a few days or weeks, will fini&s;h the campaign with mo&s;t of them.</P>
<P>The Indians have taken fifty-&s;ix hor&s;es from Ludlow-Station, the night be|fore la&s;t. This place is between Fort-Wa&s;hington and our camp. It &s;eems to be their adopted policy to capture our hor&s;es; and is, beyond a doubt, the mo&s;t effectual mode of preventing the expedi|tion again&s;t the Miami towns, as our army cannot move without hor&s;es to tran&s;port their nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions and &s;tores.

<P>SINCE I wrote the above, we have marched, cutting the road as we went, &s;ome days more, others le&s;s, undergoing cold, fatigue, and hunger; for our ratios are now reduced, until a further &s;upply &s;hall arrive.

<P>MY la&s;t letter from the We&s;t|ward, if po&s;&s;ible, has added to my depre&s;|&s;ion. Calyp&s;o, you know, was incon&s;olable for the lo&s;s of Uly&s;&s;es, and all the beauties around her only heightened her di&s;tre&s;s. Thus it is with Caroline. Fanny, although po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a greater command of her feel|ings than my&s;elf, &s;uffers inexpre&s;&s;ibly by her fears. I have at pre&s;ent, little reli&s;h for &s;ociety; but my wi&s;h to amu&s;e my drooping friend, forces me from home.</P>
<P>A few days &s;ince, we fell in company with &s;everal of tho&s;e very polite young gentlemen, who rather than give others the trouble to talk, engro&s;s the conver&s;ation them&s;elves. I dare &s;ay you frequently meet with tho&s;e coxcombs, whom nature has rendered vain, by be&s;towing upon
<PB N="98" REF="025584_0322_0FCE05F4575DFAB8">
them a likely face. Intoxicated by their per&s;onal charms, they view, with contempt, the &s;entimental and improved companion. The&s;e &s;imple pretty fellows, are, in their own opinions, accompli&s;hed characters. Having acquired a few compliments, and plundered the dictionary for the mo&s;t la|boured expre&s;&s;ions, they arrange them into unintelligible &s;entences, to which they affix a few oaths, as an additional elo|quence to their di&s;cour&s;e, imagining them|&s;elves equal to the mo&s;t celebrated philo&s;o|phers; they &s;oar into the ethereal &s;pace for their expre&s;&s;ions, and leave a common under&s;tanding, at a lo&s;s for their ideas.</P>
<P>I &s;oon took my leave of this company. The cheerful fire &s;ide of Mrs. Lea&s;on, is far preferable to the conver&s;ation of &s;uch triflers. Vi&s;iting is de&s;igned as a relaxation to the mind; and we &s;eek entertainment abroad, that we may indulge tho&s;e &s;ocial feelings, inherent in our nature. Agreea|ble &s;ociety mutually improves the under|&s;tanding; but the vague prattle of the cox|comb, can never enlarge the ideas. Vani|ty is &s;aid to be peculiar to our &s;ex. Is not

Vanity is invariably the companion of an empty mind; and an intercour&s;e with the world certainly exhibits as many vacant heads in one &s;ex as in the other; nor is beauty le&s;s de&s;tructive to the under&s;tanding of the gentlemen, than of the ladies.</P>

<P>WILL you believe me, Maria, the bearer of your la&s;t letter, Mr. Trevers, pretends to a violent pa&s;&s;ion for your friend. Let not this information impre&s;s you with an idea of my being vain. I am &s;en&s;ible we often mi&s;take attention for love; but if the mo&s;t langui&s;hing expre&s;&s;ion of the eye, the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate language of the tongue, and the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous conduct, denote affection, the youth feels the pang. It &s;eems, Maria, you have been &s;aying many civil things of your friend, and he ac|knowledges he meets me preattached. Why did you not al&s;o tell him of my engage|ments? but even this, I apprehend, would not have di&s;couraged him; for I find he is &s;o much in love with him&s;elf, that he will not ea&s;ily be brought to believe, any can be indifferent to his charms.</P>

Notwith&s;tanding he has knocked his head again&s;t the walls of a college, and taken the <HI>tour</HI> of the <HI>States,</HI> he has not acquired &s;ufficient under&s;tanding to render him&s;elf agreeable; nor would all his property, for he tells me he is "Heir to a great e&s;tate," compen&s;ate for the vacuum in his brain.

<P>AN accident, ye&s;terday, brought me into the company of Eliza. I had en|gaged to accompany a little party to a tea-hou&s;e, &s;even miles from town. When we alighted we were told the hou&s;e was croud|ed; but that a party who had dined there, were preparing to return; and that this room &s;hould be re&s;erved for us, if we would for the pre&s;ent &s;tep into a &s;mall one adjoining it. This room was a pa&s;&s;age to that in which the company was. We had not been long &s;eated, before &s;everal gentle|men and ladies pa&s;&s;ed through it, who be|ing acquainted with our party, in&s;i&s;ted we &s;hould join them. To this they cheerfully agreed. Our addition to their &s;ociety giving them new &s;pirits, they propo&s;ed to pa&s;s the evening and have a dance. I had been with this company but a &s;hort time,
<PB N="104" REF="025584_0328_0FCE05FC55DE7708">
before Eliza, with two other ladies, entered the room. I re&s;olved, however, not to render the evening painful to my friends; but, as they had made the excur&s;ion for plea&s;ure, to &s;uppre&s;s feelings which invol|untarily occur, when I con&s;ider her as the cau&s;e of my wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the party in which I was, I felt &s;e|cure from her malice, whatever the dic|tates of her heart might &s;ugge&s;t. Mu&s;ic was accordingly procured, and your friend, Mr. Trevers, &s;olicited me to engage my&s;elf as his partner for the evening; but having uniformly di&s;couraged his attachment to me, I refu&s;ed to comply with his reque&s;t, by pleading a previous engagement. Un|fortunately he obtained Eliza for his part|ner, and was placed the next couple to me. This gave him frequent opportunities of di&s;covering his gallantry, which induced him to &s;ay many &s;oft things to your friend. The&s;e I would fain have con&s;ider|ed as unmeaning &s;entences often repeated to us without de&s;ign to make impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind; but &s;o much did I engage his attention, that he was deficient in his

politene&s;s to Eliza, and frequently repeated to her the pa&s;&s;ion he experienced for me.</P>
<P>Mr. Helen, the gentleman with whom I had the happine&s;s to dance, was in his per&s;on elegant, in his manners accompli&s;h|ed, while virtue appeared to elevate his mind and invigorate his imagination; and the evening pa&s;&s;ed in the indulgence of that innocent gaiety which delineates the features of youth. I could not, however, feel that tranquillity I &s;hould have expe|rienced had Eliza been ab&s;ent. Fanny's health did not permit her attending us: Her indi&s;po&s;ition deprives her of many gratifications; but &s;he &s;hines in the hours of &s;ickne&s;s, and has a di&s;po&s;ition &s;weetly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the will of heaven. When Hygeia &s;hall for&s;ake my cheek, and the pal|lid me&s;&s;enger of incurable di&s;ea&s;e denounce the irrevocable decree, may I feel that re|&s;ignation which is &s;o &s;triking in my friend.</P>

<P>IT is in vain. I find I cannot get rid of my love-&s;ick Damon; he is the mo&s;t per&s;evering lad I ever knew. I imagine he flatters him&s;elf, that if he could obtain my hand, my heart would &s;oon follow; but love mu&s;t be free. The affections cannot be forced.

<P>IN the bo&s;om of friend&s;hip I &s;eek that con&s;olation the world cannot be|&s;tow. How full the mea&s;ure of my wretch|edne&s;s!&mdash;Read the following:&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<P>From this moment I relinqui&s;h the flattering idea of a connexion, which, in imagination, has produced &s;uch &s;cenes of future happine&s;s. Your duplicity evinces you unworthy my affection; and although it is hard to dive&s;t my&s;elf of feelings I have long encouraged, I am re&s;olved to take the final leave of an object unworthy of my heart. In this determination, I feel the &s;truggle of a &s;incere affection. I re|luctantly pur&s;ue a conduct, which nothing but the indubitable proof of your deceit, could induce me to adopt. My very par|ticular friend, Mr. L. who was lately upon a party with you, and witne&s;&s;ed your be|haviour,
<PB N="111" REF="025584_0335_0FCE06098209E960">
and the attention you then receiv|ed from your rival lovers, has given me the information. Had it not come from him, I &s;hould have &s;u&s;pected the truth; I &s;hould not have believed you capable of trifling with a man, who has thus uniformly de|mon&s;trated his attachment. I will not, however, look back to fancied felicity, to encounter my pre&s;ent feelings; it is nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;uppre&s;s every recollection of the pa&s;t. You have long &s;ince been convinced, that it was not a mere &s;entiment of tender|ne&s;s which actuated my bo&s;om, but an affec|tion refined and elevated by that &s;how of vir|tue which I flattered my&s;elf you really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed; and which my partiality prevented me from di&s;covering was, the vague drapery of an unworthy mind. From this moment I will endeavour to bani&s;h from my heart, forever, the loved image of Caroline. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> will take a final adieu of an object which I fal&s;ely, hoped to call my own&punc; I will for|get tho&s;e &s;weet ideas unmingled with a vicious pa&s;&s;ion, and if po&s;&s;ible, ri&s;e &s;upe|rior to my pre&s;ent depre&s;&s;ion; yet I can|not clo&s;e my letter, without repeating my

<P>I HAVE received a letter of con|dolence from your cou&s;in. It is tender and &s;ympathetic. He ob&s;erves, there are no reflections to imbitter the recollection of Captain Evremont, as he died like a &s;ol|dier, and was, he flatters him&s;elf, in&s;tant|ly tran&s;lated to the realms of bli&s;s. It af|fords peculiar &s;atisfaction, that he was not left upon the field of battle to encounter the la&s;t pangs of di&s;&s;olution, with the ad|ditional &s;ufferings of &s;avage torture, but that he received a &s;udden tran&s;lation from earth to heaven. The&s;e reflections pre|vent many di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ideas, which would re&s;ult from an apprehen&s;ion of his having been left without a friend, expo&s;ed to in|&s;ult, cruelty and di&s;tre&s;s. Yet my bo&s;om labours with its weight of &s;orrow.</P>

<P>CONVINCED that Maria will be a participant with me, and that the plaintive voice of unfeigned &s;orrow, will deeply in|tere&s;t your heart, I have frequent recour&s;e to my pen. It is a luxury thus to un|bo&s;om my affliction.</P>
<P>What adver&s;e &s;torms await me! What unnumbered accidents mar our felicity! Tho&s;e &s;weet moments which ble&s;t me with the &s;ociety of my friend and lover, are gone forever; they cannot be recalled: But al|though the vital &s;park has cea&s;ed to ani|mate his decaying body, and his limbs are now &s;tiffened by the hand of death, I look, with plea&s;ing expectation, to that period, when our kindred &s;ouls &s;hall meet in the region of uninterrupted felicity, to renew our friend&s;hip, and never part. Oh, bal|my

hope! what a &s;weet ingredient art thou in the cup of life! Your cou&s;in's letter to Fanny mentions, that Captain Green, hav|ing di&s;covered the mo&s;t undaunted brave|ry, received a wound in his hip, which rendered him unable to &s;tand; and as no attention was paid to the wounded veterans, he was left, when the army retreated, with many unfortunate de&s;erving men, &s;itting upon the way-&s;ide, encouraging them in their retreat.</P>
<P>My friend, Captain Clark, notwith|&s;tanding he had been engaged through the whole battle, in the early part of which he received a wound in his ancle, was &s;hame|fully left to cover the retreat of the flying army. Having tied his handkerchief over the wound, he returned five miles from the &s;pot upon which the engagement com|menced, when, grown faint with lo&s;s of blood, he begged his men to ha&s;ten on with|out him, and as he mu&s;t die, in&s;i&s;ted they &s;hould not expo&s;e their lives upon his ac|count; but at this in&s;tant a hor&s;e was ob|tained, and as his friend was a&s;&s;i&s;ting him to mount it, a ball, commi&s;&s;ioned by heav|en,

<P>RECEIVE, my dear Maria, my &s;incere and grateful acknowledgments, for that warm participation, you &s;o feelingly expre&s;s, in your la&s;t letter, for my&s;elf and Fanny. The pre&s;ent painful event, has indeed involved us in real afflictions.</P>
<P>Though the lo&s;s of friends is ever pain|ful to the feeling and &s;ympathetic, there are circum&s;tances which mitigate the&s;e una|voidable afflictions, and certainly it is no incon&s;iderable one, to be allowed, by heav|en, to contribute, though but in the &s;mall|e&s;t degree, to the comfort of their depart|ing moments, to receive their la&s;t injunc|tions, and to pay the re&s;pect due to their memory. But the&s;e plea&s;ing, painful grat|ifications are denied upon the pre&s;ent af|fecting occa&s;ion, and the bodies thus dear
<PB N="132" REF="025584_0356_0FCE062E18AB9CE0">
to the recollection of congenial friends, are not only fallen a &s;acrifice in a di&s;tant country, but have become the plunder of the &s;avage tribes, from whom we cannot expect le&s;s than barbarity and abu&s;e. Could I &s;elect the melancholy remains of tho&s;e departed heroes, and depo&s;it them in one friendly vault, then would I indulge the luxury which would re&s;ult from moi&s;tening the &s;acred &s;od, and guarding it again&s;t the rude feet of di&s;re&s;pectful intruders. But, alas! every friendly office is denied; and were it not for the fragrant reflection, which alone perfumes the gloomy mind, that the &s;oul, that &s;uperiour and immortal part, is fled, far beyond the former confines of its &s;oli|tary pri&s;on, and is beyond the reach of mortal re&s;entment, we &s;hould be encircled with an impenetrable night, and pierced with &s;uch additional arrows, as would convey incurable poi&s;ons, contaminate ev|ery enjoyment, and canker every &s;ocial plea&s;ure. But this idea, illumes the men|tal hemi&s;phere; it le&s;&s;ens the affliction.</P>
<P>There is, indeed, an additional &s;atisfac|tion, that although by a lively fancy we
<PB N="133" REF="025584_0357_0FCE062F978D1D20">
can picture their di&s;tre&s;s, yet the truth, if corre&s;ponding with tho&s;e piercing images of our afflicted mind, is, with us, a matter of uncertainty; and the real &s;ufferings which they have undergone, are concealed from our view.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly do I feel the pre&s;ent &s;troke. Yes, Maria, it will not look to you, who have &s;o often heard my &s;enti|ments of my friends while living, as afflic|tion decorated in the language of unmean|ing flattery, but as the genuine &s;prouts of a real regard, which have grown &s;ponta|neous in the warm bo&s;om of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Since the fir&s;t moment of my acquaint|ance with Captain Evremont, I have ac|knowledged my&s;elf his friend. My par|tiality may po&s;&s;ibly magnify his merits; but I am confident I give him no more than his due, when I &s;ay, few po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed minds better formed, or &s;entiments more &s;trictly con&s;onant with integrity, bravery, and honour. In private life, he was par|ticularly di&s;tingui&s;hed, by tho&s;e virtues which form the ba&s;is of a real friend; and as his ideas were delicate and refined, I
<PB N="134" REF="025584_0358_0FCE0631D7120950">
was ever happy to receive his approbation of my &s;entiments, valuing it as the evidence of their worth. As a &s;oldier, I can add no encomiums: Public fame echoes from every quarter his prai&s;e; and the monu|ments, upon which will be enrolled the names of many brave and valiant, will evince to future ages, the obligations of their country, and the general regret, which the unhappy event produced.</P>
<P>Fanny's indi&s;po&s;ition has increa&s;ed, &s;ince the unfortunate accounts of the we&s;tern army: May heaven give her &s;trength to &s;u&s;tain the pre&s;ent affliction; for without the interpo&s;ition of an over-ruling Provi|dence, many &s;urviving friends mu&s;t &s;ink beneath this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing event.</P>

<P>NEXT Tue&s;day is appointed for the celebration of Laura's nuptials. My mind is too much pervaded with di&s;|quietude, to &s;hare with Mrs. Lea&s;on and her daughter, upon this plea&s;ing event. Not only the lo&s;s of my friends has ca&s;t a veil over my enjoyments, but the &s;ituation of Fanny's health, gives an additional dejection to my &s;pirits&mdash;my heart, indeed, is in&s;en&s;ible to the plea&s;ing vibrations of mirth. Attuned to &s;orrow, it cannot feel the joy of the family: But I am not un|mindful of the ble&s;&s;ings I yet experience. No, my dear, ingratitude &s;hall not intrude upon me, for if it is the blacke&s;t crime, which can di&s;colour human actions, its ma|lignity mu&s;t be infinitely augmented, when indulged again&s;t heaven&punc; What are the

The friends of tho&s;e unfortunate men who were wounded in the fir&s;t of the battle, and left to cover the retreat of the army, will long retain a lively recollection of the error: Nor will the mo&s;t plentiful draughts of Lethe, obliterate the deed.

<P>LAURA left this city &s;ome days &s;ince. The confu&s;ion in which the family have been involved, by the wed|ding, preparations, &amp;c. has kept me three weeks a pri&s;oner to my room. I am be|come quite an invalid.</P>
<P>Mr. Helen's attention attaches me to him. He in&s;i&s;ts I &s;hall have the ad|vice of a phy&s;ician. But medicine will not heal a bleeding heart. Time only can re&s;tore tranquillity. While in the pre&s;ent aby&s;s of affliction, I am not to be amu&s;ed by delu&s;ive images of future happine&s;s. I am ab&s;orbed in the contemplation of my lo&s;s&mdash;a lo&s;s aggravated by the unhappy cir|cum&s;tances which preceded it. Yet I will not &s;eclude my&s;elf from the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety and friend&s;hip. Here ardent, and

&s;u&s;ceptible hearts, derive a &s;atisfaction which cannot be defined. In the pre&s;ence of our friends, the tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub&s;ide; the care-worn mind is lulled by the &s;weetening intercour&s;e. It enjoys a momentary repo&s;e; and while it is amu&s;ed with the adventures of youth, it is taught experience by the le&s;&s;ons of age. In the friendly circle, the attention is diverted from tho&s;e turbulent &s;cenes of folly, which too often engage the mind; and a placid tranquillity favourable to the gentle virtues, &s;ecure our mo&s;t refined enjoyments. It is not our duty to indulge a de&s;ponding tem|per. Submi&s;&s;ion &s;hould ever mark the chri&s;tian character. Yet it is hard to relin|qui&s;h the objects upon which we had placed our pro&s;pects of future happine&s;s. The unfortunate Mrs. Gardner, has been de|prived of her rea&s;on, from the fir&s;t moment the fatal information of her hu&s;bands death reached her; and her friends fear the del|irium rather increa&s;es than &s;ub&s;ides. This mu&s;t be an additional affliction to her un|happy family.</P>

<P>MR. Helen has been ab&s;ent a week; and I will acknowledge to Maria, that I feel the lo&s;s of his &s;ociety. Habit|uated to his condoling language, I am ev|en &s;en&s;ible of impatient moments. That &s;incerity he evinces for me, that benevolent, friendly, and affectionate attention he has ob&s;erved to my happine&s;s, in&s;en&s;ibly at|taches me to him. I am charmed with his unaffected manners. Alive to the gentle emotions, the tender &s;entiments of human|ity, his mind a&s;pires with every laudable principle, and his &s;oul is exalted by a &s;u|periour worth. How does my friend&s;hip, for him, &s;often my &s;en&s;ibility! It is this which actuates my mind. Without the plea&s;ures, which are derived from friend&s;hip,

<P>Your friend, Mr. Trevers, continues to vi&s;it me. I &s;incerely wi&s;h his mind more enlightened, his manners more plea&s;ing. He intends &s;oon to leave us; and has urg|ed me to accompany him to Long I&s;land.

<P>YOUR cou&s;in came upon us by &s;urpri&s;e, although we had expected him &s;everal days. I wrote him a few lines la&s;t week and mentioned the &s;ituation of Fan|ny, reque&s;ting him, upon his arrival here, to acquaint me with it, previous to his calling at Mrs. Lea&s;on's, that I might pre|pare my friend for an interview, which I apprehended would &s;en&s;ibly affect her; but this letter did not reach camp before he had left it, and unfortunately he met Fan|ny in the entry as &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing to the carriage, which was in waiting at the door. I &s;hall not pretend to de&s;cribe their &s;en&s;a|tions. There are certain &s;cenes, which mu&s;t be felt to be realized; among the&s;e is the plea&s;ure of embracing the object of our fonde&s;t wi&s;hes, after a painful &s;eparation,

and tho&s;e only who experience a pure affec|tion, who exi&s;t but in the felicity of each other, can realize the rapturous moment. True love is not an illu&s;ion of the mind; it is a pa&s;&s;ion which, by brightening the pro&s;pect of human life, increa&s;eth the hap|pine&s;s of its votaries. The bo&s;om of my friend was agitated with joy and &s;orrow. The return of her lover from a dangerous excur&s;ion, recalled the lo&s;s of an affection|ate brother, and their meeting was &s;ilently expre&s;&s;ive of a &s;incere affection. Mr. Bel|mour had entertained no idea of the ill &s;tate of Fanny's health; and the langour, which indi&s;po&s;ition had &s;pread over her countenance, impre&s;&s;ed him with a thought|fulne&s;s which he could not bani&s;h. Hard did he &s;truggle to conceal the ri&s;ing tear. Tho&s;e who could have been indifferent to &s;o affecting a meeting, mu&s;t be without claim to tenderne&s;s. I regret that your health obliges you to defer your vi&s;it, having long embo&s;omed the darling expectation of &s;ee|ing you in Philadelphia.

<P>YOU think the heart of Caroline in danger; and that, under the idea of friend&s;hip, &s;he is encouraging affection. I doubted not a pang of jealou&s;y would &s;eize you, when you read my late acknow|ledgment. "It may," you &s;ay, "po&s;&s;ibly be, that I may find a lover, where I ex|pected only a friend." However lively this anticipation, I cannot con&s;ent to de|prive my&s;elf of an agreeable companion, nor have I the vanity to believe that Mr. Helen has the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of a connex|ion with me. His attentions ari&s;e from that amiable goodne&s;s of &s;oul, which uni|formly adorns his actions. Con&s;idering me as an unprotected woman, he kindly &s;teps forward, as a brother, to advi&s;e me; but be a&s;&s;ured, it is only friend&s;hip which actuates him. That he is my friend, I

have every rea&s;on to believe; I am flatter|ed with his partiality; I am grateful for it; I thank you, however, for your caution, and will endeavour to keep a watchful eye upon my heart. I am al&s;o aware of the &s;entiments of the world, who immediate|ly &s;tyle attention, court&s;hip; nor am I ig|norant with what avidity, fancied connex|ions are circulated abroad. You &s;ay, "From the character I have given you of Mr. Helen, you acknowledge there is lit|tle danger that he will exerci&s;e any advan|tage from the di&s;covery of my partiality; although it is po&s;&s;ible he means to gain my affection, previous to a declaration of his attachment." Be a&s;&s;ured, Maria, I &s;hall never di&s;cover the &s;entiments of my heart, in a way which &s;hall lincen&s;e him to a&s;&s;ume upon it; nor do I think him capable of pur&s;uing a conduct &s;o replete with vanity, &s;o degrading to the honour of my &s;ex.

<P>Fanny is now &s;leeping by me. I flatter my&s;elf &s;he re&s;ts more &s;erenely than &s;he has for &s;ome time pa&s;t. Her cough is ob&s;tinate; nor are her other &s;ymptoms le&s;s alarming.

When I con|&s;ider the critical &s;ituation of Fanny, who, I fear, will &s;oon be taken from me, I can &s;carcely &s;upport the reflection. To &s;ee tho&s;e who are in the bloom of youth, &s;natch|ed from the enjoyments of life, and con|&s;igned, by the cruel &s;poiler, to the untime|ly grave, is peculiarly affecting; yet the&s;e in&s;tances frequently occur, and we daily &s;ee the ravages which relentle&s;s death makes among us&mdash;"Breaking the thread of an elegant affection," and di&s;uniting the near|e&s;t friends; but I pray heaven long to avert the blow, and yet to &s;pare the friend and the companion of my heart: If, how|ever,

<P>My affection to your cou&s;in, is enhanc|ed by his attention to my declining friend. He has brought with him the pocket-book, journal, and &s;word of the late Captain Gardner; the&s;e he has delivered to my care. I &s;hall forward them by the fir&s;t pri|vate conveyance, to his amiable widow.</P>
<P>The watchman now proclaims the mid|night hour, and nature, which is ea&s;ily exhau&s;ted, begins to want repo&s;e; I will, therefore, wi&s;h you a good night, and in|dulge her ju&s;t demands. But while my &s;en&s;es are confined in &s;leep, may my dreaming fancy be &s;imilar to Maria's.</P>

<P>THE unju&s;t a&s;per&s;ions which have been ca&s;t upon the character of Gene|ral Hill, have greatly added to the affliction of your cou&s;in. It is, however, his re&s;o|lution at the ri&s;k of his commi&s;&s;ion to vin|dicate the reputation of that brave de&s;erv|ing officer. Since his arrival, he has ad|dre&s;&s;ed a letter to the unfortunate widow, in which he offers to produce indi&s;putable evidence, to prove the conduct of her de|cea&s;ed hu&s;band uncen&s;urable. His con|duct mu&s;t be replete with the mo&s;t grateful &s;en&s;ations to an afflicted widow, &s;ufficiently involved in di&s;tre&s;s by the lo&s;s of an affec|tionate hu&s;band, without the additional tortures of unmerited reflections.

young an officer to di&s;pute the official ac|counts of his General; but &s;hould he be arre&s;ted, and, which is too often the ca&s;e, finally made a &s;acrifice to men in power, as he is not dependent upon his commi&s;|&s;ion for his exi&s;tence, I feel a&s;&s;ured, that &s;pirit of independence, which now marks the inve&s;tigation, will be his &s;upport.</P>
<P>The late defeat of the we&s;tern army, bears a &s;triking analogy to that at Ticon|deroga, in 1777; nor was the rapid flight of the army at that place, le&s;s de&s;tructive, nor the fate of General Hill di&s;&s;imilar to that of the brave Colonel F. who was left, alike un&s;upported, while his com|mander fled &s;ix miles from the &s;cene of action!

A &s;ingle error in the life of a great man, has frequently de&s;troyed the monument of his fame. A uniform attention to ju&s;tice, is the only foundation that can render him &s;ecure.

<P>He is impatient to become a married man. Much &s;hall I pity the lady with whom he is connected. If &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;entiments &s;imilar to my own, &s;he mu&s;t indeed be wretched.

But &s;uch there are, who are mo&s;t gratifi|ed, when &s;eparated from each other. A lady, educated in a vortex of amu&s;ement, has little idea of any happine&s;s, but that which re&s;ults from a round of di&s;&s;ipation. Her mind is employed in new plans of dec|orating her per&s;on; and when connected with a man of corre&s;pondent ta&s;te, they form a fa&s;hionable pair.

other. They pur&s;ue &s;eparate gratifications; &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ing an hour at home together; and if they chance to meet in company, are civil to each other: But this, &s;he does not regret.</P>
<P>Such a woman is be&s;t calculated for your friend, Mr. Trevers; but happier they, who pa&s;s through life, enjoying the &s;uperiour ble&s;&s;ings of a &s;incere attachment. May this happine&s;s be the lot of Maria and</P>

<P>SINCE I la&s;t addre&s;&s;ed my friend, a &s;trange incident has taken place. I have already acquainted you that Mr. King being &s;oon to &s;ail for England, had hurried the propo&s;ed connexion. The evening had arrived, the company a&s;&s;em|bled, the mini&s;ter every in&s;tant expected, when a loud knocking at the door, was &s;uppo&s;ed to announce his arrival; but this proved a letter to Mr. King; and the bear|er reque&s;ted to &s;ee him in private. Soon after, Mrs. Lea&s;on was called out of the room. Here unfolded a &s;cene, to which all de&s;cription is inadequate; and of &s;uch a nature, that it could not be communicat|ed to the di&s;appointed company. A me&s;|&s;enger was, however, in&s;tantly di&s;patched, to acquaint the clergyman that the wedding
<PB N="186" REF="025584_0410_0FCE068CA3A18D30">was deferred; and the company were told, by a particular friend, that for certain rea|&s;ons, which could not then be divulged, the wedding was po&s;tponed. Various con|jectures aro&s;e, in the brea&s;ts of all who were pre&s;ent, but none could &s;olve the real cau&s;e. For &s;everal days, I was my&s;elf a &s;tranger to the true circum&s;tances, until, by re|peated importunities, I prevailed upon Mrs. Lea&s;on to entru&s;t me with the &s;ecret, when &s;he gave into my hand the following letter:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MR. James King, the young gentle|man I take the liberty to introduce to you, is the natural &s;on of our mutual friend the late Captain John Lea&s;on, who, for many years, &s;ailed from Philadelphia in the Lon|don trade. His father upon his arrival here, &s;oon after his birth, appropriated the intere&s;t of a certain &s;um for his &s;upport and education, and appointed me the guardian of this youth. Plea&s;ed with his natural abilities and manly &s;entiments, I have paid particular attention to my tru&s;t; and as he inclined to the mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s, I took
<PB N="187" REF="025584_0411_0FCDE9F3E8D71BD0">
him into my counting-hou&s;e, and &s;ince he has been of age, into partner&s;hip with me. He has been taught to con&s;ider him&s;elf an orphan, and has ever been called King; but knowing your attachment to his de|cea&s;ed father, I thought fit to communicate a &s;ecret to you, which I never before di&s;|clo&s;ed to any per&s;on. He is on a vi&s;it to Philadelphia, and, if he finds it agreeable, intends to e&s;tabli&s;h a hou&s;e in that city; but his &s;tay will be &s;hort, as matters of con|&s;equence render it indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould be in London in June. If he can po&s;&s;ibly find lei&s;ure to vi&s;it you, I have enjoined it upon him, and any atten|tion &s;hewn to him will be gratefully ac|knowledged by your friend and humble &s;ervant, &amp;c.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This letter, it appears, upon his arrival, he forwarded to Connecticut, and upon the receipt of it, the gentleman to whom it was written, &s;ent a pre&s;&s;ing invitation for Mr. King to pay him a vi&s;it; to this polite and friendly reque&s;t, he re|turned for an&s;wer, that a multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the plea&s;ing connexion which he was about to form with a widow

Lea&s;on, together with his being obliged to return immediately to England, put it out of his power. Upon the receipt of this, his friend was alarmed, and im|mediately wrote by expre&s;s, to prevent the marriage; in which letter he enclo&s;ed the above. The timely moment of their arri|val was, indeed, a happy circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lea&s;on is much affected at the event. The attachment &s;he felt for Mr. King when &s;he con&s;idered him as her hu&s;|band, mu&s;t be very different from that fil|ial affection &s;he mu&s;t now experience. Mr. King was born two years before the mar|riage of Mrs. Lea&s;on. This, with the af|fection which &s;he retains for her decea&s;ed hu&s;band, &s;trongly attaches her to his &s;on. However the above &s;tory may re&s;emble fic|tion or romance, be a&s;&s;ured it has made too deep an impre&s;&s;ion upon my heart, ea&s;ily to be effaced.</P>

<P>FANNY and my&s;elf, coming from church on Sunday la&s;t, were addre&s;&s;ed by a young gentleman to whom I was a &s;tran|ger; but in &s;uch a familiar way, that I was &s;oon convinced he was an old acquaintance of her's. He gallanted us home. When we reached Mrs. Lea&s;on's, with an air of indifference, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed upon him the com|pliment of walking in. This invitation he readily accepted. She now introduced him to Mrs. Lea&s;on and my&s;elf. I found, by her unu&s;ual re&s;erve, that he was not agreeable to my friend. From his conver|&s;ation I di&s;covered he had been ab&s;ent three years; and had but ju&s;t returned to Amer|ica. In the evening, Mrs. Lea&s;on wi&s;hing me to vi&s;it a particular friend, propo&s;ed my going with her. To this I agreed,
<PB N="190" REF="025584_0414_0FCE069359898578">
and we left them, promi&s;ing to return in a &s;hort time. But the hours, in agreeable company, pa&s;s with great rapidity; and we had lengthened our vi&s;it far beyond our intention, before we were aware of the time we had been from home. Yet upon our return we found Mr. A&s;hely with Fan|ny. Immediately upon my entering the room, I di&s;covered his agitation. I had a &s;trong propen&s;ity to be acquainted with the hi&s;tory of this young gentleman, and as &s;oon as he withdrew, applied to my friend for the circum&s;tances of their fir&s;t acquaintance.</P>
<P>"Mr. A&s;hely," &s;aid &s;he, "belongs to Maryland; but was educated with an un|cle in Havre-de-Grace, and has, for many years, fooli&s;hly encouraged a partiality for me. This I have invariably a&s;&s;ured him I cannot return. His friends, alarmed by the con&s;equences of my ob&s;tinate refu&s;al, have repeatedly intere&s;ted them&s;elves in his behalf. My own connexions were for &s;ome time de&s;irous that I &s;hould encourage his attentions; but my heart has uniform|ly di&s;avowed every favourable &s;entiment
<PB N="191" REF="025584_0415_0FCE0695DB8CDF28">
for him; and I have con&s;tantly declared it impo&s;&s;ible ever to be his; yet he has per|&s;i&s;ted to encourage his unhappy attachment &mdash;I have been wretched by his per&s;ecu|tions. At length his friends, convinced I could not be brought to con&s;ider him as a lover, cea&s;ed their importunity, and ad|vi&s;ed him to avoid my company. I al&s;o a&s;&s;ured him, unle&s;s he could re&s;olve never to mention a &s;ubject &s;o painful to me, it was my determination to &s;eclude my&s;elf from his &s;ociety, and never to &s;ee him more; but if he would vi&s;it the family as a tran&s;ient acquaintance, he might rely up|on my treating him with every civility; and that on this footing alone, he mu&s;t in future expect to meet me. After this he became negligent of his bu&s;ine&s;s, which increa&s;ed the unea&s;ine&s;s of his friends: They urged him to take a voyage to India; and his uncle made him &s;uch propo&s;als as induced him to accede to their wi&s;hes. From this voyage he has ju&s;t returned, and accidentally has di&s;covered my being in this city; he has already renewed the declara|tion of his pa&s;&s;ion; I mu&s;t therefore deny

my&s;elf to him; and if unfortunately I &s;hould fall into his company, I mu&s;t en|treat you never to leave me alone with him."</P>
<P>It is unhappy for Mr. A&s;hely that he can|not give up a woman who entertains not a partial &s;entiment for him. I regret that he has di&s;covered her being in Philadelphia, and &s;hall exert my&s;elf to prevent every in|terview between them.

<P>IT appears to be the determination of Mr. A&s;hely, at all events to obtain the hand of Fanny. He has been &s;everal times with me, &s;oliciting my influence with her; and a&s;&s;ures me his whole happine&s;s depends upon it. This accompli&s;hed, he thinks nothing could impede the plea&s;ures of fu|ture life. I have endeavoured to impre&s;s upon him the nece&s;&s;ity of his relinqui&s;hing the idea, as &s;he is ab&s;olutely engaged to another; and that this alone, would be a bar to every pro&s;pect of a union with him. "Ab&s;olutely engaged to another," &s;aid he, "where is the enviable man?" I replied, gone to vi&s;it his friends. "If this is to prevent my further application, know, Madam, that I &s;hall not &s;o ea&s;ily relin|qui&s;h the object of my warme&s;t affection.
<PB N="194" REF="025584_0418_0FCE069AE40B6AC0">
Life, without Fanny, is in&s;upportable. Werter could not exi&s;t when Charlotte was beyond his reach. I will have one more interview with her&mdash;beg her to grant this la&s;t reque&s;t," Fanny, &s;aid I, has been many months deprived of health; I wi&s;h rather to relieve her mind from every un|ea&s;y thought, than add to her anxiety by an application which mu&s;t be painful to her. Nothing favourable can re&s;ult from the interview.</P>
<P>He walked the room in great agitation; and pre&s;ently &s;eating him&s;elf at the table, wrote a few lines which he de&s;ired me to give her. Unwilling he &s;hould think that I influenced her, I rung the bell for the &s;ervant, and &s;ent her up &s;tairs with the bil|let. To this &s;he returned for an&s;wer, that he was well acquainted with the &s;entiments from which &s;he had never deviated, and mu&s;t be excu&s;ed complying with his re|que&s;t.</P>
<P>He now came towards the fire, and tak|ing from his pocket the Sorrows of Werter, he turned to a page where this &s;ophi&s;tical rea&s;oner, fallaciou&s;ly argues in favour of

&s;uicide; and reading it exclaimed, "My &s;entiments, oh Werter! are &s;trictly con&s;o|nant with thine. Life without the object of my wi&s;hes, would be a void." You cannot, &s;aid I, ju&s;tify a conduct &s;o repre|hen&s;ible as Werter's. A conduct, which uniformly demon&s;trated a weak, and wick|ed mind. Con&s;ider that Charlotte was a wife; con&s;equently he could have no ex|pectation of honourably obtaining the object of his wi&s;hes. Was it not his duty to cru&s;h every idea of a criminal attach|ment? In&s;tead of which, he glories in the wicked indulgence of an impious pa&s;&s;ion, and ever &s;tands ready to commit the mo&s;t atrocious deeds. He impo&s;es no re&s;traint upon his inclination, but deducing his ar|guments from the mo&s;t ab&s;urd cau&s;es, he endeavours to ju&s;tify a conduct fatally er|roneous. Trace his extravagant beha|viour, and it will evidently appear, that ca|price, pride, and pa&s;&s;ion, are the prin|ciples which govern his actions. By no means, Mr. A&s;hely, &s;aid I, encourage the ideas of that writer. It is expo&s;ing your&s;elf to the immediate precipice of de|&s;truction.
<PB N="196" REF="025584_0420_0FCE069F1BB36A58">
"Make him," &s;aid he, "what you plea&s;e; &s;ophi&s;tical, fallacious, vile; upon his arguments I am willing to de|pend for my future happine&s;s." When he had &s;aid this, he was greatly agitated, and left the room. Believe me, at this mo|ment every &s;entiment of my heart beat for the unhappy &s;ituation of the deceived youth.</P>

<P>Mrs. Lea&s;on has received a late letter from Laura, which mentions, that Mr. Gibbins has entirely lo&s;t the u&s;e of his limbs.

She has had a tolerable night, &s;aid I, but I have not yet mentioned your wi&s;hes to her.

&s;ugge&s;tions of de&s;pair. At the fatal hour, Mr. A&s;hely returned to know the deter|mination of Fanny. I was &s;itting in the chamber with my friend, when the girl came to acquaint her that he was below. She reque&s;ted that he might be a&s;ked up &s;tairs into the drawing-room; where, in expectation of company, a fire had been kindled, and went her&s;elf immediately in|to it. I had a book in my hand, and in vain endeavoured to read; being &s;eized with a univer&s;al horror. In a few minutes the report of a pi&s;tol, like a &s;evere &s;hock of electricity, deprived me of my &s;trength; the firing was in&s;tantly repeated; Mrs. Lea&s;on and the family were alarmed; and running up &s;tairs, opened the door of the drawing room, when a &s;pectacle pre&s;ent|ed, which reality only can give a ju&s;t idea of. For &s;ome time, every exertion I made to ri&s;e was in vain. The general, the pierc|ing &s;cream, which immediately &s;ucceeded the opening of the drawing-room door, con|vinced me Mr. A&s;hely had committed the act of &s;uicide; but I had no idea, that he had al&s;o taken away the life of my friend.

She was leaning back in an arm chair; the blood profu&s;ely poured from her wound; nothing can ever efface the im|pre&s;&s;ions the horrid &s;ight has made upon my mind.

I repeatedly men|tioned to Mrs. Lea&s;on, the &s;atisfaction which I flattered my&s;elf would re&s;ult from my vi&s;it to Philadelphia. In the cour&s;e of the evening I experienced many painful &s;en&s;ations at their long &s;tay; the&s;e in|crea&s;ed
<PB N="224" REF="025584_0448_0FCE06C66634E240">
with the advancing hours; yet I endeavoured to &s;ooth my apprehen&s;ions, by forming &s;ome unavoidable delay. Mrs. Lea&s;on di&s;covering my anxiety, u&s;ed every argument to quiet my fears, and kindly endeavoured to conceal her own unea&s;ine&s;s; but convinced that Caroline's impatience to meet me, exclu&s;ive of every other con|&s;ideration, would have ha&s;tened her early return, had not &s;ome unhappy circum&s;tance impeded her wi&s;hes, it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to di&s;pel my anxiety: I therefore re|tired to my chamber, with feelings con|tra&s;ted to tho&s;e I had annexed with my arrival in this place. Here I continued till pa&s;t eleven, when a carriage &s;topped at the door. I in&s;tantly hurried down &s;tairs&mdash; The voice of my brother was grateful to my ears. I ran to meet him, inquiring for Caroline. He took me by the hand, and led me into the parlour&mdash;Where is my friend? &s;aid I. He evaded a reply. I ca&s;t my eyes upon Maryann&mdash;di&s;tre&s;s was vi&s;ible in her countenance. I ob&s;erved her turn a&s;ide, as if to conceal her tears. Mrs. Lea&s;on begged to know what had
<PB N="225" REF="025584_0449_0FCE06C7D7F4B0C0">
detained Mr. Helen and Caroline&mdash;I &s;ec|onded her &s;olicitation. "An accident has prevented them from accompanying us," replied my brother; and pa&s;&s;ing into the kitchen, Mrs. Lea&s;on followed. I became more alarmed, and went immediately after them. He was &s;itting by the table, and Mrs. Lea&s;on was untying a handkerchief, which was bound round his head, that &s;he might dre&s;s his wound. I now di&s;covered blood upon his face. Mr. Hervey, &s;aid I, it is impo&s;&s;ible for the reality to be wor&s;e than my fears; keep me not thus in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, let me know what has befallen Car|oline and your&s;elf. "Be not di&s;tre&s;&s;ed," &s;aid he, and drawing a chair near him, he reque&s;ted me to &s;it down. He now in|formed me, that in con&s;equence of the letter which &s;he had received from Mr. He|len, Maryann and him&s;elf had agreed to accompany her a few miles out of town, in expectation of meeting him; and &s;topping at a public hou&s;e, they called for tea; con|cluding, by the time it was ready, Mr. Helen would be with them; but, hav|ing waited until dark, he propo&s;ed their re|turning
<PB N="226" REF="025584_0450_0FCE06CA6C5A4368">
to town. Caroline became very unhappy; &s;he took her letter from her pocket, and repeatedly read it over; &s;he &s;crutinized the hand writing&mdash;compared it with others &s;he had received from Mr. He|len, and believed it to be his; nor would &s;he con&s;ent to leave the inn, until nine o'clock. At this late hour they &s;at off for home; but had not proceeded far upon the road, before they were attacked by two men; one of whom, &s;eizing the bridle of the hor&s;es, fired at the driver, &s;hot him in the &s;ide, and obliged him to come from his &s;eat; the other went up to the &s;ide of the carriage upon which my brother was, and pre&s;enting a pi&s;tol at him, a&s;&s;ured him not a moment was to be delayed; that their de&s;ign was not again&s;t his life, but he mu&s;t immediately relinqui&s;h the lady who was with him. Caroline was &s;itting oppo&s;ite to him, and &s;eeing his danger, gave the arm of the villain a &s;udden pu&s;h, upon which the pi&s;tol in&s;tantly went off, and &s;lightly wounded my brother in the head. Maryann had fainted at the fir&s;t of the at|tack, and had fallen upon the floor of the
<PB N="227" REF="025584_0451_0FCDE9FE4653B0A0">
coach, where &s;he remained during the whole &s;cene. The villain who had wound|ed the driver, led the hor&s;es to a tree, where he made them fa&s;t, and joined his accom|plice. My brother was without any kind of weapon. In vain were his wi&s;hes to protect my friend&mdash;&s;he was torn from him. His attention was now called to Maryann, whom he rai&s;ed up, and acquainted her with what had pa&s;&s;ed. After this, he made a &s;earch for the driver, whom he found too much weakened, with the bleeding of his wound, to re&s;ume his &s;eat; they therefore took him into the carriage, and Mr. Her|vey drove home him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Since this unhappy event, every po&s;&s;ible &s;tep has been pur&s;ued to di&s;cover the wretch|ed Caroline&mdash;but exertion has hitherto been ineffectual. It is generally believed that the re&s;entful mind of Eliza, has plan|ned this unheard of revenge; although it has been given out for &s;everal weeks, that &s;he has &s;ailed for Europe.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not fail to tran&s;mit you every cir|cum&s;tance which takes place, re&s;pecting the di&s;covery of Caroline; and flatter my&s;elf her &s;ituation cannot long be concealed.</P>

<P>IT it &s;everal weeks &s;ince you re|ceived my la&s;t. Nothing has yet occurred re&s;pecting the di&s;covery of Caroline. Mr. Helen's friends, ye&s;terday received a letter from a phy&s;ician who re&s;ides at a village a few miles from this city, informing them that he lies dangerou&s;ly ill; and reque&s;ting them, without delay, to ha&s;ten to him. They &s;et off this morning&mdash;my brother accompanied them. I am very &s;olicitous for his return.</P>
<P>Several letters directed to Caroline, which have reached Philadelphia &s;ince the misfortune that has befallen her, we have been induced to open. They were from

<P>THE ta&s;k how painful! I have to communicate to you, my dear Harriot, the dreadful, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing certainty of my Caroline's fate! All hopes of recovering my friend, are now de&s;troyed&mdash;my con&s;o|lation fled&mdash;what keen &s;en&s;ations accompa|ny the di&s;tracting thought! Every exertion I make to &s;uppre&s;s my grief, &s;wells my bo|&s;om with in&s;upportable angui&s;h. But I will exert my&s;elf to relate the circum&s;tanc|es as I received them from Mr. Hervey, who left Mr. Helen la&s;t evening.</P>
<P>It appears, that being detained upon the road, he put up at a public hou&s;e in the village, where he yet remains; and be|ing
<PB N="231" REF="025584_0455_0FCE06DB71488038">
intimate with a couple of young gen|tlemen who are &s;tudying with the phy&s;ician in that town, he called upon them, and was introduced into their room. He had not long been with them, before he under|&s;tood they were that evening to di&s;&s;ect the body of a young lady who had died with an uncommon di&s;order, and they were anx|ious to di&s;cover the &s;ource of her com|plaints; but her friends having refu&s;ed their opening her, they had privately tak|en her up, and gave him an invitation to &s;tay with them during the operation. This he accepted. The &s;ubject was &s;oon brought out of the clo&s;et, and the &s;heet in which it was concealed untied. Mr. Helen, upon &s;eeing the face, di&s;covered the countenance of Caroline. A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> an event &s;o totally unex|pected, the &s;eat of rea&s;on in&s;tantly became vacant; his eyes fla&s;hed with the di&s;trac|tion of his mind; he flew to the body, rai&s;ed it from the floor, pre&s;&s;ed it to his bo&s;om, and exhibited the mo&s;t frantic ago|nies of de&s;pair&mdash;continually repeating the name of Caroline. His friends were final|ly obliged to force him from it, and con|fine
<PB N="232" REF="025584_0456_0FCE06DDC0AFCFD0">
him, le&s;t in his violent fit of di&s;trac|tion, he &s;hould commit &s;ome outrage. Hav|ing made him &s;ecure, they returned to the &s;ubject, and &s;oon di&s;covered, that the body, in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was not the one they wi&s;hed to obtain. They had marked the grave, and were certain they had taken it from the &s;pot where their patient had been buried; yet the conduct of Mr. Helen ap|peared very my&s;terious. Acquainted with his engagements to Caroline, and recol|lecting her being forced from the carriage, with the di&s;covery of their mi&s;take, they &s;u&s;pected the cau&s;e of Mr. Helen's afflic|tion; and in this they were confirm|ed, by his con&s;tant repetition of Caroline's name. A violent fever &s;oon &s;eized him, and an expre&s;s was, the next morning, di&s;|patched for his friends, who have no ex|pectation of his recovery.</P>
<P>Upon opening the grave the next day, the coffin from which my dear Caroline had been taken, was found; and upon remov|ing this, the one that contained the &s;ub|ject, the&s;e young gentlemen were in pur&s;uit of, was di&s;covered. It is believed the body of
<PB N="233" REF="025584_0457_0FCE06DF1A39FD40">
my friend was intentionally concealed here, to prevent any &s;u&s;picions, that might ari&s;e upon the appearance of a new grave, which could not be accounted for. No marks of violence were found upon her body, and it is thought that &s;he fell a &s;acrifice to her di&s;|tre&s;s, and died with a broken heart. Altho' we cannot trace the immediate authors of her death, we do not he&s;itate on whom to fix as the &s;ource of this calamity. The invariable per&s;ecutions which this unhap|py girl has experienced from Eliza, will li|cen&s;e every conjecture. Her unre&s;trained jealou&s;y, has been productive of the mo&s;t complicated di&s;tre&s;s, to an innocent, amia|ble woman. Her artful and revengeful mind, has been continually creating &s;ome malignant de&s;ign again&s;t her, in which &s;he has finally been too &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>How dangerous &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition!&mdash;how prejudicial to the plea&s;ures of &s;ocial life! My pre&s;ent feelings are a&s;&s;ociated with the &s;weet remembrance of Caroline's virtues. To do ju&s;tice to the&s;e I am inadequate; but I will endeavour to copy from her plea&s;ing example, that my memory may be alike grateful to my friends.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="025584_0458_0FCE06E099836328">That her unfortunate &s;tory may enforce a &s;triking le&s;&s;on, and early teach us to &s;up|pre&s;s every unhappy pa&s;&s;ion, is the wi&s;h of your affectionate &s;i&s;ter,</P>
