<ARGUMENT>
<P>Original State of the Fore&s;t.&mdash;The Adven|tures of <HI>WALTER PIPEWEED</HI> and <HI>CE|CILIUS PETERSON.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO perform the promi&s;e which I made to you before I began my journey, I will give you &s;uch an account of this, once fore&s;t, but now cultivated and plea&s;|ant country, as I can collect from my con|ver&s;ation with its inhabitants, and from the peru&s;al of their old family papers,
<PB N="12" REF="030051_0011_0FE415B106E7E220">
which they have kindly permitted me to look into for my entertainment. By the&s;e means I have acquainted my&s;elf with the &s;tory of their fir&s;t planting, con&s;equent improvements, and pre&s;ent &s;tate; the re|cital of which will occupy the hours which I &s;hall be able to &s;pare from bu&s;ine&s;s, com|pany and &s;leep, during my re&s;idence among them.</P>
<P>IN reading the character of <HI>John Bull,</HI> which was committed to paper &s;ome years ago by one who knew him well, you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that though "he was in the main an hone&s;t, plain dealing fellow, yet he was choleric and incon&s;tant, and very apt to <HI>quarrel with his be&s;t friends.</HI>" This ob&s;ervation you will find fully verified in the cour&s;e of the narrative; and as the opinions and manners of &s;uperiors have a very great influence in forming the char|acter of inferiors, you need not be &s;ur|pri&s;ed if you find a family likene&s;s pre|vailing among the per&s;ons who&s;e hi&s;tory I
<PB N="13" REF="030051_0012_0FE415B4D4A22678">
am about to recite, mo&s;t of whom were formerly re&s;idents in Mr. Bull's hou&s;e, or apprentices in his &s;hop.</P>
<P>THERE was among the appendages to John's e&s;tate, a pretty large tract of land, which had been neglected by his ance&s;tors, and which he never cared much about, ex|cepting that now and then &s;ome of his family went thither a hunting, and brought home veni&s;on and furs. Indeed this was, as far as I can find, the be&s;t pretence that John had to call the land his; for he had no legal title to it. It was then a very woody country, in &s;ome parts rocky and hil|ly, in other parts level; well watered with brooks and ponds, and the whole of it bor|dered on a large lake, in which were plenty of fi&s;h, &s;ome of which were often &s;erved up at John's table, on fa&s;t days.</P>
<P>THE &s;tories told by one and another of the&s;e adventurers, had made a deep impre&s;|&s;ion on the mind of <HI>Walter Pipeweed,</HI> one
<PB N="14" REF="030051_0013_0FE415B69B9AF4A0">
of John's dome&s;tics, a fellow of a roving and projecting di&s;po&s;ition, and who had learned the art of &s;urveying. Walter hav|ing frequently li&s;tened to their chat, began to think within him&s;elf, "If the&s;e fellows make &s;o many pence by their excur&s;ions to this wild &s;pot, what might not I gain by &s;it|ting down upon it? There is plenty of game and fi&s;h at hand, for a pre&s;ent &s;upply; plenty of nuts and acorns to fatten pigs, and with &s;ome &s;mall labour I may be able to rai&s;e corn and feed poultry, which will fetch me a good price at market.&mdash;I can carry bi&s;ket enough in my pockets to keep me alive till my fir&s;t crop comes in, and my dog can live upon the offals of the game that I &s;hall kill.&mdash;Be&s;ides, who knows what trea&s;ures the land it&s;elf may contain&mdash;per|haps &s;ome <HI>rich mines!</HI>&mdash;then I am made for this world&mdash;I &s;hall be as rich as <HI>Lord Strut!</HI></P>
<P>FULL of this dream, Walter applied to his ma&s;ter one day for a lea&s;e of part of
<PB N="15" REF="030051_0014_0FE415B89063D8B8">
<HI>the fore&s;t,</HI> as it was called. Bull at fir&s;t laughed at the propo&s;al, and put him off; but Walter followed it up &s;o clo&s;e, and told what advantages might be gained by &s;ettling there, and promi&s;ed, if he &s;hould &s;ucceed, to turn all his trade into his ma&s;|ter's hand, and give him the refu&s;al of whatever he might bring to market, and withal &s;hewed him &s;ome drafts, which he had made with chalk, from the reports of the hunt&s;men, that Bull began to think of the matter in good earne&s;t, and con&s;ult|ed his lawyer upon the &s;ubject, who, after due con&s;ideration of the premi&s;es, and &s;trok|ing his band, advi&s;ed him as follows. "Why yes, Mr. Bull, I don't &s;ee why you ought not to look about you as well as your neigh|bours. You know that old <HI>Lord Peter</HI> lays claim to the whole country, and has a&s;&s;um|ed to parcel it out among his devotees. He has given all the we&s;tern part of it, where this fore&s;t lies, to <HI>Lord Strut,</HI> and he has a large manor adjoining to your fore&s;t, which, they &s;ay, yields him a fine rent, and
<PB N="16" REF="030051_0015_0FE415BA370F4E70">
who knows but this may bring you in as much, or more?&mdash;Then there is <HI>Lewis,</HI> the cudgel player, and <HI>Nicholas Frog,</HI> the dra|per, who have, perhaps, (I &s;ay <HI>perhaps,</HI> Mr. Bull, becau&s;e there may be a little doubt on both &s;ides, and in that ca&s;e, you know Sir, it would not become gentlemen of our cloth to &s;peak po&s;itively) as good a claim as your Honor to this land; but then it is a maxim, you know, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is elev|en points of the law, and if you once get your foot upon it, they cannot ou&s;t you without a proce&s;s, and your Honor knows that your pur&s;e is as long as theirs, and you are as able to &s;tand a &s;uit with them as they are with you. I therefore advi&s;e you to hu|mour your man Walter, and give him a lea&s;e, and a pretty large one&mdash;you may find more advantages in it than you are aware of&mdash;but lea&s;e it, lea&s;e it, at any rate." Upon this he was ordered to make out a lea&s;e; and Walter being thus inve&s;ted with as good authority as could be obtained, fill|ed his pockets with bread and chee&s;e, took
<PB N="17" REF="030051_0016_0FE415BD53EBD698">
his gun, powder-fla&s;k, and &s;hot of various kinds, with a parcel of fi&s;hing-lines and hooks, his &s;urveying in&s;truments, and a bag of corn on his &s;houlders, and off he trotted to his new paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>IT was &s;ome time before he could fix upon a &s;pot to his liking, and he at fir&s;t met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition from the bears and wolves, and was greatly expo&s;ed to the weather, before he could build him a hut; once or twice the &s;avage animals had almo&s;t devoured him, but being made of good &s;tuff, he &s;tood his ground, cleared a little &s;pot, put his &s;eed into the earth, and lived as well as &s;uch adventurers can expect, poorly e|nough at fir&s;t, but &s;upported, as all new planters are, by the hope of better times. After a while he began to thrive, and his ma&s;ter Bull recommended a <HI>wife,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The charter of Virginia.</NOTE> whom he married, and by whom he had a number of children. Having found a new &s;ort of grain in the fore&s;t, and a certain plant of a narcotic quality, he cultivated both, and
<PB N="18" REF="030051_0017_0FE415BF8B6D27D8">
having procured a number of <HI>black cattle,</HI> he went on pretty gaily in the planting way, and brought his narcotic weed into great repute, by &s;ending a pre&s;ent of a quantity of it to his old ma&s;ter, who grew exce&s;&s;ive|ly fond of it, and kept calling for more, till he got the whole trade of it into his own hands, and &s;old it out of his own ware|hou&s;e to Lewis, Frog, and all the other trade&s;men around him. In return, he &s;up|plied Walter with cloths and &s;tuffs for his family, and uten&s;ils for his hu&s;bandry; and as a reward for being the fir&s;t, who had courage to make a &s;ettlement in his fore&s;t, he dignified his plantation with the name of the <HI>ancient dominion.</HI> Be&s;ide this mark of re&s;pect, and in token of his high e&s;teem of him as a cu&s;tomer, as well as for certain other rea&s;ons, he made it a practice, every year, to pre&s;ent him with a waggon load of <HI>Ordure,</HI> the &s;weepings of his back yard, the &s;crapings of his dog kennel, and contents of his own water clo&s;et. This was a mark of politene&s;s which John valued him&s;elf
<PB N="19" REF="030051_0018_0FE415C18099E670">
much upon. "It may &s;eem odd (&s;aid he one day to a friend) that I make &s;uch a kind of compliment as this to my good cu&s;tom|er; but if you con&s;ider it aright, you will find it a piece of refined policy; for by this means I get rid of a deal of tra&s;h and rub|bi&s;h that is nece&s;&s;arily made in &s;uch a fam|ily as mine; I get a cur&s;ed &s;tink removed from under my no&s;e, and my good friend has the advantage of it upon his farm, to manure his grounds, and make them pro|duce more plentifully that precious weed in which we all &s;o much delight." Walter was often &s;een, on the arrival of Bull's waggon, to clap his handkerchief to his no&s;e; but as he knew his old ma&s;ter was an odd &s;ort of a fellow, and it was his in|tere&s;t to keep in with him, he generally turned off the compliment with a laugh, &s;aying, good-naturedly enough, "Let him laugh that wins," without explaining his meaning, though it might admit of a <HI>double entendre;</HI> then calling &s;ome of his &s;ervants, he ordered them to &s;hovel out the dung,
<PB N="20" REF="030051_0019_0FE4159075D382B0">
and make his black cattle mix theirs with it. When &s;pread over the land, the air took out mo&s;t of the &s;cent, and the &s;alts were of &s;ome advantage to the &s;oil.</P>
<P>AFTER Walter Pipeweed had got his af|fairs into tolerable order, he was vi&s;ited in his retirement by <HI>Cecilius Peter&s;on,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Baltimore, who fir&s;t &s;ettled Maryland, was a Papi&s;t; his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors abjured Popery, and conform|ed to the Church of England.</NOTE> anoth|er of Bull's apprentices, who had taken a fancy to the &s;ame kind of life, from a di&s;|gu&s;t to &s;ome things that had happened in the family. He had not been long with Walter before he found it would not do for him to remain there. Peter&s;on was &s;uppo|&s;ed to be a natural &s;on of old <HI>Lord Peter,</HI> after whom he was nick-named. He had the &s;ame affected airs, and a tincture of the high-flying notions of his reputed father. The&s;e made him rather di&s;gu&s;tful to Wal|ter, who had learned his manners of Mr. Bull's mother, when &s;he was in her &s;ober
<PB N="21" REF="030051_0020_0FE415C60219DB68">
&s;en&s;es, and between her and Lord Peter there had been a long variance. When Peter&s;on perceived that his company was not de&s;ired, he had &s;o much good &s;en&s;e as to leave Walter's plantation, and, paddling acro&s;s a creek, &s;eated him&s;elf on a point of land that ran out into the lake. Of this he obtained a lea&s;e of his old ma&s;ter, and went to work in the &s;ame manner as Walter had done, who, liking his company be&s;t at a di&s;|tance, was willing to &s;upply him with bread and meat till he could &s;cramble for him&s;elf. Here he took to hu&s;bandry rai&s;ing corn and the narcotic weed, and buying up <HI>black cat|tle,</HI> and after a while turned his produce into his old ma&s;ter's ware-hou&s;e, and received from him the annual compliment of a wag|gon load of dung, excepting that when there had not been &s;o much as u&s;ual made, he and Walter were to &s;hare a load between them.</P>
<P>TO ingratiate him&s;elf &s;till farther with his old ma&s;ter, he accepted of a girl out of his family for a wife, (for John was always
<PB N="22" REF="030051_0021_0FE415C7EACB5280">
fond of his tenants marrying for fear of their doing wor&s;e) he took as little notice as po&s;&s;ible of his reputed father, and drop|ping, or di&s;owning his nick-name of Peter|&s;on, he a&s;&s;umed that of <HI>Marygold,</HI> which old Madam Bull under&s;tood as a compli|ment to one of her daughters. He al&s;o made his court to the old lady by kneeling down and ki&s;&s;ing the golden fringe of her embroidered petticoat, as was the fa&s;hion of that day. This ceremony, though a trifle in it&s;elf, helped much to recommend him to Mr. Bull, who was a very dutiful &s;on, and took his mother's advice in mo&s;t parts of his bu&s;ine&s;s. In &s;hort, Cecilius was too much of a politician to &s;uppo&s;e that filial affection ought to &s;tand in the way of a man's intere&s;t, and in this he judged as ma|ny other men would have done in the &s;ame circum&s;tances.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ABOUT the time in which the&s;e fir&s;t attempts were making, and the fame of them had rai&s;ed much jealou&s;y among &s;ome, and much expectation among others, there happened a &s;ad quarrel in <HI>John Bull</HI>'s family. His mother, poor woman, had been &s;eized with hy&s;teric fits, which cau&s;ed her at times to be delirious and full of all &s;orts of whims. She had taken it into her head that every one of the family mu&s;t hold
<PB N="24" REF="030051_0023_0FE415CB89F725C0">
knife and fork and &s;poon exactly alike; that they mu&s;t all wa&s;h their hands and face preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner; that they mu&s;t &s;it, &s;tand, walk, kneel, bow, &s;pit, blow their no&s;es, and perform every other ani|mal function by the exact rule of <HI>uniformity,</HI> which &s;he had drawn up with her own hand, and from which they were not al|lowed to vary one hair's breadth. If any one of the family complained of a lame an|cle or &s;tiff knee, or had the crick in his neck, or happened to cut his finger, or was any other way &s;o di&s;abled as not to perform his duty to a tittle, &s;he was &s;o far from making the lea&s;t allowance, that &s;he would frown, and &s;cold, and rave like a bedlamite; and John was &s;uch an obedient &s;on to his moth|er, that he would lend her his hand to box their cars, or his foot to kick their back|&s;ides, for not complying with her humours. This way of proceeding rai&s;ed an uproar in the family; for though mo&s;t of them com|plied, either through affection for the old lady, or through fear, or &s;ome other motive,
<PB N="25" REF="030051_0024_0FE415CFAD7659F8">
yet others looked &s;our, and grumbled; &s;ome would openly find fault and attempt to remon&s;trate, but they were an&s;wered with a kick or a thump, or a cat-o'nine-tails, or &s;hut up in a dark garret till they promi&s;ed a compliance. Such was the logic of the family in tho&s;e days!</P>
<P>AMONG the number of the di&s;affected, was <HI>Peregrine Pickle,</HI> a pretty clever &s;ort of a fellow about his bu&s;ine&s;s, but a great lov|er of &s;our crout, and of an humour that would not bear contradiction. However, as he knew it would be fruitle&s;s to enter into a downright quarrel, and yet could not live there in peace; he had &s;o much pru|dence as to quit the hou&s;e, which he did by getting out of the window in the night. Not liking to be out of employment, he went to the hou&s;e of <HI>Nicholas Frog,</HI> his ma&s;ter's old friend and rival, told him the &s;tory of his &s;ufferings, and got leave to em|ploy him&s;elf in one of his work&s;hops till the &s;torm &s;hould be over. After he had been here a while, he thought Nick's family were
<PB N="26" REF="030051_0025_0FE415D15A606D18">
as much too loo&s;e in their manners as Bull's were too &s;trict; and having heard a ru|mour of the Fore&s;t, to which Nick had &s;ome kind of claim, he packed up his little all, and hired one of Nick's &s;ervants who had been there a hunting, to pilot him to that part of the Fore&s;t to which Nick laid claim. But Frog had laid an anchor to windward of him; for as Pickle had &s;aid nothing to him about a lea&s;e, he &s;uppo&s;ed that when Peregrine had got into the For|e&s;t he would take a lea&s;e of his old ma&s;ter Bull, which would &s;trengthen his title, and weaken his own; he therefore bribed the pilot to &s;hew Peregrine to a barren part of the Fore&s;t, in&s;tead of that fertile place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hud&s;on's River.</NOTE> to which he had already &s;ent his &s;urveyors, and of which he was contriving to get po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. Accordingly the pilot having con|ducted Pickle to a &s;andy point which runs into the lake,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cape Cod.</NOTE> it being the du&s;k of the even|ing,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The month of December.</NOTE> bade him good night, and walked off. Peregrine, who was fatigued with his
<PB N="27" REF="030051_0026_0FE415D307174EC0">
march, laid down and went to &s;leep, but waking in the morning, &s;aw him&s;elf alone in a very dreary &s;ituation, where he could get nothing to live upon but clams, and a few acorns which the &s;quirrels had left. In this piteous plight, the poor fellow folded his arms, and walking along the &s;andy beach, fell into &s;uch a &s;oliloquy as this. "So much for travelling! Abu&s;ed by Bull, cheat|ed by Frog, what am I at la&s;t come to? Here I am alone, no creatures but bears, and wolves, and &s;uch vermin around me! Nothing in the &s;hape of an human being that I know of, nearer than Pipeweed's plan|tation, and with him I cannot agree; he is &s;o devoted to old Dame Bull that he and I cannot live together any more than I could with the old woman. But, why &s;hould I de&s;pair? That is unmanly; there is at lea&s;t a <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of my living here, and if I am di&s;appointed in my worldly pro&s;pects, it is but right, for I profe&s;&s;ed not to have any. My wi&s;h was to have my own way without di&s;turbance or contradic|tion, and &s;urely I can here enjoy my liber|ty.
<PB N="28" REF="030051_0027_0FE415D4FB48A2C0">
I have nobody here to cur&s;e me, or kick me, or cheat me. If I have only clams to eat, I can cook them my own way, and &s;ay as long a grace over them as I plea&s;e. I can &s;it or &s;tand, or kneel, or u&s;e any other po&s;ture at my devotions, without any cro&s;s old woman to growl at me, or any hector|ing bully to cuff me for it. So that if I have lo&s;t in one way I have gained in anoth|er. I had better therefore reconcile my&s;elf to my &s;ituation, and make the be&s;t of a bad market. But company is good! A propos! I will write to &s;ome of my fellow-appren|tices; I know they were as di&s;contented as my&s;elf in old Bull's family, though they did not care to &s;peak their minds as plainly as I did. I'll tell them how much happi|ne&s;s I enjoy here in my &s;olitude. I'll point out to them the charms of liberty, and coax them to follow me into the wilderne&s;s; and by and by, when we get all together, we &s;hall make a brave hand of it." Full of this re&s;olution, he &s;at down on a wind-fall|en tree, and pulling out his inkhorn and pa|per; wrote a letter to <HI>John Codline, Hum|phry
<PB N="29" REF="030051_0028_0FE415D8AE1C17A8">
Plough&s;hare,</HI> and <HI>Roger Carrier,</HI> three of his fellow-apprentices, informing them of the extreme happine&s;s he enjoyed in hav|ing liberty to eat his &s;canty meals in his own way, and to lay his &s;welled ancles and &s;tiff knee in whatever po&s;ture was mo&s;t ea&s;y to him; conjuring them by their former friend&s;hip, to come to join him in carry|ing on the good work &s;o happily begun, &amp;c. &amp;c. As &s;oon as he had fini&s;hed the letter, (which had deeply engaged his atten|tion) a hunt&s;man happened to come along in que&s;t of game. This was a lucky cir|cum&s;tance indeed, for Peregrine had not once thought of a conveyance for his let|ter; it proved al&s;o favourable to him in another view, for the hunt&s;man taking pity on his forlorn &s;ituation, &s;pared him &s;ome powder and &s;hot, and a few bi&s;cuit which he happened to have in his pocket; &s;o tak|ing charge of the letter, he delivered it as it was directed.</P>
<P>THIS letter arrived in good &s;ea&s;on, for old Madam had grown much wor&s;e &s;ince
<PB N="30" REF="030051_0029_0FE415DAA5F8B400">
Pickle had left the family; her vapours had increa&s;ed, and her longings and aver|&s;ions were much &s;tronger. She had a &s;trange lurch for embroidered petticoats and high waving plumes; her Chri&s;tmas pies mu&s;t have double the quantity of &s;pice that was u&s;ual; the &s;ervants mu&s;t make three bows where they formerly made but one, and they mu&s;t never come into her pre&s;ence without having curled and powdered their hair in the pink of the mode, for &s;he had an aver&s;ion to every thing plain, and a &s;trong reli&s;h for every thing gaudy. Be|&s;ides, &s;he had an high-mettled chaplain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Archbi&s;hop Laud.</NOTE> who was con&s;tantly at her elbow, and &s;aid prayers night and morning in a brocaded cope with a gilded mitre on his head; and he exacted &s;o many bows and &s;crapes of ev|ery one in the family, that it would have puzzled a French dancing-ma&s;ter to have kept pace with him. Nor would he per|form the &s;ervice at all, unle&s;s a verger &s;tood by him all the while with a yard-wand in his hand; and if any &s;ervant or apprentice
<PB N="31" REF="030051_0030_0FE415DC9A504460">
mi&s;&s;ed one bow or &s;crape, or made it at the wrong time, or dared to look off his book, or &s;aid Amen in the wrong place, rap went the &s;tick over his head and ears or knuckles. It was in vain to appeal from the chaplain or the old Dame to their ma&s;ter, for he was &s;o obedient a &s;on that he &s;uffered them to govern him as they plea&s;ed; nay, though broad hints were given that the chaplain was an emi&s;&s;ary of lord Peter, and was tak|ing advantage of the old lady's hy&s;terics to bring the whole family into his intere&s;t, John gave no heed to any of the&s;e in&s;inuations.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the letter of Peregrine Pickle arrived, the apprentices, to whom it was directed, held a con&s;ultation what they &s;hould do. They were heartily tired of the conduct of the chaplain; they lament|ed the old lady's ill health, and wi&s;hed for a cure; but there was at pre&s;ent no hope of it, and they concluded that it was be&s;t to follow Pickle's advice, and retire with him into the Fore&s;t. Though they were infected with the &s;pirit of adventure, yet
<PB N="32" REF="030051_0031_0FE415DE46CCA960">
they were a &s;et of wary fellows, and knew they could not with &s;afety venture thither unle&s;s they had a lea&s;e of the land. Hap|pily, however, for them, Bull had a little while before that put the affairs of the For|e&s;t into the hands of a gentleman of the law,<NOTE PLACE="foot">The Council of Plymouth in Devon&s;hire.</NOTE> with orders to &s;ee that the matter was properly managed, &s;o as to yield him &s;ome certain profit. To this &s;age they ap|plied, and for the proper fees, which they clubbed for between them, they obtained a lea&s;e, under hand and &s;eal; wherein, for "&s;undry cau&s;es him thereunto moving, the &s;aid Bull did grant and convey unto John Codline and his a&s;&s;ociates, &s;o many acres of his Fore&s;t, bounded &s;o and &s;o, and which they were to have, hold, and enjoy for ever and ever, yielding and paying &s;o and &s;o, and &s;o forth." When this grand point was gained by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the lawyer and <HI>his clerks,</HI> who knew how to manage bu&s;i|ne&s;s, the adventurers &s;old all their &s;uper|fluities to the pawn-brokers, and got to|gether what things they &s;uppo&s;ed they

&s;hould want, and leaving behind them a note on the compter,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter written on board the Arabella, after the embarkation of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;ettlers.</NOTE> to tell their ma&s;ter where they were bound, and what were their de&s;igns; they &s;et off all together and got &s;afe into a part of the Fore&s;t adjoining to Pickle, who, hearing of their arrival, took his oaken &s;taff in his hand, and hob|bled along as fa&s;t as his lame legs could carry him to &s;ee them, and a joyful meet|ing indeed they had. Having laid their heads together, it was agreed that Codline &s;hould &s;end for a girl whom he had court|ed,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts charter.</NOTE> and marry her, and that he &s;hould be con&s;idered as the lord of the manor, that Pickle &s;hould have a lea&s;e of that part which he had pitched upon, and that Plough&s;hare and Carrier &s;hould for the pre&s;ent be con|&s;idered as members of Codline's family. John had taken a great fancy to fi&s;hing, and thought he could wholly or chiefly &s;ub|&s;i&s;t by it; but Humphry had a mind for a farm; &s;o after a while they parted in
<PB N="34" REF="030051_0033_0FE4166362139648">
friend&s;hip. Humphry, with a pack on his back and a &s;pade in his hand, travelled a|cro&s;s the Fore&s;t till he found a wide mead|ow with a large brook<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Connecticut River.</NOTE> running through it, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be within John's grant, and intended &s;till to con&s;ider him&s;elf as a di&s;tant member of the family. But as it fell out otherwi&s;e, he was obliged to get a new lea&s;e, to which Mr. Frog made &s;ome objections, but they were over-ruled; and &s;oon after another old fellow &s;ervant, THE|OPHILUS WHEAT-EAR, came and &s;at down by him. They being &s;o much alike in their views and di&s;po&s;itions, agreed to live to|gether as intimates, though in two families, which they did till Wheat-ear's death, when Plough&s;hare became his &s;ole heir, and the e&s;tate has ever &s;ince been his. This Hum|phry was always a very indu&s;trious, frugal, &s;aving hu&s;band; and his wife, though a formal &s;trait-laced &s;ort of a body, yet al|ways minded her &s;pinning and knitting, and took excellent care of her dairy. She al|ways cloathed her children in home&s;pun gar|ments,
<PB N="35" REF="030051_0034_0FE415E4613C4148">
and &s;carcely ever &s;pent a farthing for outlandi&s;h trinkets. The family and all its concerns were under very exact reg|ulations: not one of them was &s;uffered to peep out of doors after the &s;un was &s;et. It was never allowed to brew on Saturday, le&s;t the beer &s;hould break the Fourth Com|mandment by working on Sunday: and once, it is &s;aid, the &s;tallion was impounded a whole week for holding <HI>crim. con.</HI> with the mare while the Old gentleman was at his devotions. Bating the&s;e peculiarities, (and every body has &s;ome) Humphry was a very good &s;ort of a man, a kind neighbour, very thriving, and made a re&s;pectable fig|ure. Though he lived a retired life, and did not much follow the fa&s;hions, yet he rai&s;ed a good e&s;tate, and brought up a large family. His children and grand-children have penetrated the interior parts of the country, and &s;eated them&s;elves on the be&s;t &s;oil, which they know how to di&s;tingui&s;h at fir&s;t &s;ight, and to cultivate to the great|e&s;t advantage.

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER Plough&s;hare's departure, John Codline with his family kept on their fi&s;hing and planting, and &s;ometimes went a hunting, &s;o that they made out to get a tolerable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. John's family grew, and he &s;ettled his &s;ons as fa&s;t as they be|came of age, to live by them&s;elves; and
<PB N="37" REF="030051_0036_0FE415E806999728">
when any of his old acquaintance came to &s;ee him, he bade them welcome, and was their very good friend, <HI>as long as they contin|ued to be of his mind,</HI> and no longer; for he was a very pragmatical &s;ort of a fellow, and loved to have his own way in every thing. This was the cau&s;e of a quarrel between him and <HI>Roger Carrier,</HI> for it hap|pened that Roger had taken a fancy to dip his head into water,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anabapti&s;ts.</NOTE> as the mo&s;t effectual way of wa&s;hing his face, and thought it could not be made &s;o clean in any other way. John, who u&s;ed the common way of taking water in his hand, to wa&s;h his face, was di&s;plea&s;ed with Roger's innovation, and remon&s;trated again&s;t it. The remon|&s;trance had no other effect, than to fix Roger's opinion more firmly; and as a far|ther improvement on his new plan, he pretended that no per&s;on ought to have his face wa&s;hed till he was capable of doing it him&s;elf, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his parents. John was out of patience with this addition, and plumply told him, that
<PB N="38" REF="030051_0037_0FE415EC45881788">
if he did not reform his principles and practice, he would fine him, or flog him, or kick him out of doors. The&s;e threats put Roger on inventing other odd and whim&s;ical opinions. He took offence at the letter X, and would have had it ex|punged from the alphabet, becau&s;e it was the &s;hape of a cro&s;s, and had a tendency to introduce Popery.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Roger Williams's zeal again&s;t the &s;ign of the cro&s;s.</NOTE> He would not do his duty at a military mu&s;ter, becau&s;e there was an X in the colours. After a while he began to &s;cruple the lawfulne&s;s of bear|ing arms, and killing wild bea&s;ts. But, poor fellow! the wor&s;t of all was, that being &s;eized with a &s;haking pal&s;y,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Quakers.</NOTE> which affected every limb and joint of him, his &s;peech was &s;o altered that he was unable to pronounce certain letters and &s;yllables as he had been u&s;ed to do. The&s;e oddities and defects rendered him more and more di&s;agreeable to his old friend, who, how|ever, kept his temper as well as he could, till one day, as John was &s;aying a long
<PB N="39" REF="030051_0038_0FE415EDEEA46630">
grace over his meat, Roger kept his hat on the whole time. As &s;oon as the ceremony was over, John took up a ca&s;e-knife from the table, and gave Roger a blow on the ear with the broad &s;ide of it, then with a ri&s;ing &s;troke turned off his hat. Roger &s;aid nothing, but taking up his hat put it on again; at which John broke out into &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ionate &s;peech as this&mdash;"You impudent &s;coundrel! is it come to this? Have I not borne with your whims and fidgets the&s;e many years, and yet they grow upon you? Have I not talked with you time after time, and proved to you as plain as the no&s;e in your face that your no|tions are wrong? Have I not ordered you to leave them off, and warned you of the con&s;equence, and yet you have gone on from bad to wor&s;e? You began with dip|ping your head into water, and would have all the family do the &s;ame, pretending there was no other way of wa&s;hing the face. You would have had the children go dirty all their days, under pretence that they were not able to wa&s;h their own faces,
<PB N="40" REF="030051_0039_0FE415EFE28D8520">
and &s;o they mu&s;t have been as filthy as the pigs till they were grown up Then you would talk your own balderda&s;h lin|go, <HI>thee and thou, and nan for&s;ooth</HI>&mdash;and now you mu&s;t keep your hat on when I am at my devotions, and I &s;uppo&s;e would be glad to have the whole family do the &s;ame! There is no bearing with you any longer&mdash;&s;o now, hear me, I give you fair warning, if you don't mend your manners, and retract your errors, and promi&s;e refor|mation, I'll kick you out of the hou&s;e. I'll have no &s;uch refractory fellows here: I came into this fore&s;t for <HI>reformation,</HI> and reformation I <HI>will</HI> have."</P>
<P>"FRIEND John (&s;aid Roger) do&s;t not thou remember when thou and I lived to|gether in friend Bull's family, how hard thou did&s;t think it to be compelled to look on thy book all the time that the hooded chaplain was reading the prayers, and how many knocks and thumps thou and I had for offering to u&s;e our liberty, which we thought we had a right to? Did&s;t thou

not come hitherunto for the &s;ake of enjoy|ing thy liberty, and did not I come to en|joy mine? Wherefore then do&s;t thou a&s;|&s;ume to deprive me of the right which thou claime&s;t for thy&s;elf?"</P>
<P>"DON'T tell me (an&s;wered John) of right and of liberty&mdash;you have as much liberty as any man ought to have. You have liberty to do right, and no man ought to have liberty to do wrong."</P>

<P>"WHO is to be judge? (&s;aid John) why <HI>the book</HI> is to be judge; and I have proved by the book over and over again that you are wrong, and therefore you are wrong, and you have no liberty to do any thing but what is right."</P>

<P>AT this John was &s;o enraged that he gave him a &s;mart kick on the po&s;teriors, and bade him be gone out of his hou&s;e, and off his lands, and called after him to tell him, that if ever he &s;hould catch him there again he would knock his brains out. Roger, having experienced the logic of the foot, applied to the &s;eat of honour, walked off, with as much <HI>meekne&s;s</HI> as hu|man

nature is capable of, on &s;uch occa|&s;ions; and having travelled as far as he &s;uppo&s;ed to be out of the limits of John's lea&s;e, laid him&s;elf down by the &s;ide of a clear rivulet, which &s;lowed down a hill; here he compo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;leep, and on his awaking found &s;everal bears about him, but none offered him any in&s;ult. Upon which he &s;aid, and minuted it down in his pocket-book, "Surely the bea&s;ts of the wilderne&s;s are in friend&s;hip with me, and this is de&s;igned by <HI>Providence</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The town of Providence was built by emigrants from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, of whom Roger Williams was head.</NOTE> as my re&s;t|ing place; here, therefore, will I pitch my tabernacle, and here &s;hall I dwell more in peace, though &s;urrounded by bears and wolves, than when in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e whom I counted my brethren."</P>
<P>On this &s;pot he built an hut, and having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, made a vi&s;it to his old ma&s;|ter Bull, who gave him a lea&s;e of the place, with an i&s;land or two in an adjoining cove

of the great lake, and recommended to him a wife, by whom he had a few chil|dren; but his plantation was chiefly in|crea&s;ed by the flocking of &s;trangers to him; for he was a very ho&s;pitable man, and made it a rule in his family not to refu&s;e any who &s;hould come, whether lame or blind, &s;hort or tall, whether they had two eyes or one, whether they &s;quinted, or &s;tammered, or limped, or had any other natural defect or impediment; it was another rule that all &s;hould bear with the infirmities of their neighbours, and help them as they were able. Once, as I was pa&s;&s;ing through Roger's plantation, I &s;aw one man carrying another on his &s;houlders, which, at fir&s;t, I thought a very odd &s;ight; upon coming up to them, I perceived that the lower one was blind, and the upper one was lame, &s;o as they had but one pair of eyes and one pair of legs between them, the lame man availed him&s;elf of the blind man's legs, and he of the other's eyes, and both went along very well together. I remember al&s;o, that as I pa&s;&s;ed along, the fences were in
<PB N="45" REF="030051_0044_0FE415FAC6936920">
&s;ome places made of very crooked, knotty rails; but the crooks and knots were made to &s;ay into each other &s;o cleverly, that the fences were as tight as if they had been made of &s;tuff &s;awed ever &s;o even; a circum|&s;tance which convinced me that very crook|ed things might be put together, to advan|tage, if proper pains were taken.</P>
<P>WHEN John Codline had &s;ettled the controver&s;y with Roger, by kicking him out of doors, he began to look about him to &s;ee what his neighbours were doing. Having found a young fellow on his north-ea&s;tern limits, who had come thither with|out his knowledge or permi&s;&s;ion, he took it into his head to &s;urvey the extent of his grounds. The words of his lea&s;e were rather ambiguous, and by virtue thereof, he thought it convenient to extend his claims over the lands on which <HI>Robert Lumber</HI> (for that was the name of the young fellow) had &s;ettled. It &s;eems that Bob had been &s;ent by &s;ome of John Bull's family to erect a fi&s;hing &s;tage on the borders of
<PB N="46" REF="030051_0045_0FE415FF9BDE1050">
the lake, and the lawyer who had the care of the fore&s;t not being acquainted &s;o much as he ought to have been with the &s;ituation of the lands, or having no knowledge of the art of &s;urveying, had made out a lea&s;e which lapped over Codline's; &s;o that each of them had a claim upon the &s;ame land. In &s;ome circum&s;tances this might have been deemed unfortunate, but as it happened it proved lucky for poor Bob. His employers had left him in the lurch, and he would have &s;tarved to death if John had not taken him under his wing and &s;ent him provi&s;ions to keep him alive. He al&s;o lent him a hand to clear up the bu&s;hes, and furni&s;hed him with materials to build a &s;aw-mill. This &s;et Bob on his own legs, and he proved a &s;turdy faithful fellow. He was of great &s;ervice to John in killing bears and wolves that infe&s;ted his plantation; and when he him&s;elf was in danger, John lent him pow|der, &s;hot, and flints, and &s;ent hands to help him; and in &s;o doing he &s;erved him&s;elf as well as his neighbour, which was no breach of morality. Thus they lived pretty peace|ably
<PB N="47" REF="030051_0046_0FE41601464F95D8">
together, till after a while Bob's old owners found the land was grown good for &s;omething, and then (without paying John for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in making it &s;o) appealed to Mr. Bull, <HI>and got it away,</HI> and took a large &s;lice of John's land into the bargain.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ettling the line between Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New Hamp&s;hire.</NOTE> This was a matter which &s;tuck in John's throat a great while, and if I am rightly in|formed he has hardly &s;wallowed it yet. He did not think him&s;elf fairly dealt by, though he had all Peregrine Pickle's land put into a new lea&s;e which Bull gave him. To be &s;hort, John Codline and John Bull never heartily loved one another; they were in their temper and di&s;po&s;ition too much alike; each was eternally jealous of the other; and this jealou&s;y was kept alive by a variety of incidents which it would be too tedious to enumerate. One of them, however, was of &s;o &s;ingular a nature that I think it de&s;erves to be remembered. It was this. Lewis had erected a fi&s;hing

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t letter I had got a little too forward in my &s;tory, in point of time; but as I write by piecemeal, and often in a hurry, you mu&s;t excu&s;e chronological in|accuracy. I now go back to tell you, that between the lands occupied by Marygold, and tho&s;e on which Plough&s;hare had made
<PB N="50" REF="030051_0049_0FE4160974319E38">
his &s;ettlement, was a large tract of wa&s;te, where none of Mr. Bull's family had ever been; but the report of the plantations which one and another of them had made, drew the attention of Bull's neighbours. Among the&s;e, <HI>Nicholas Frog</HI> was not an idle &s;pectator. He was as &s;ly a fellow as you will meet with in a &s;ummer's day, always attentive to his intere&s;t, and never let &s;lip an opportunity to promote it. Ob&s;erving that Mr. Bull was rather carele&s;s of the Fore&s;t, and tru&s;ted his lawyers and &s;ervants&punc; with the management of it, and knowing there was a large &s;lice of it unoccupied, he clande&s;tinely &s;ent out &s;ome &s;urveyors in the di&s;gui&s;e of hunters, to make a de&s;crip|tion of the country, and report to him at their return. Another good neighbour, <HI>Gu&s;tavus</HI> the ironmonger, was gaping after it, and gave out word among his journey|men, that if any of them would adventure thither and &s;et up their trade, he would uphold them in their preten&s;ions, and lend them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power. Accord|ingly one of them, by the name of <HI>Ca&s;imir,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="030051_0050_0FE4165FACEED690">
ventured to make a beginning on the &s;hore of a navigable creek;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Delaware.</NOTE> but did not care to penetrate far into the country, on account of the wolves and bears, which were very numerous thereabout. As &s;oon as Frog heard of this, he picked a quarrel with Gu&s;tavus, and in&s;i&s;ted that the land was his, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e he had already &s;ent &s;urveyors thither. It happened, how|ever, that the place which Frog's people had pitched upon was at the mouth of an|other creek,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hud&s;on's river.</NOTE> at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; where they had built a hut, on a point of land, and farther up the creek had erected a kind of lodge or hunting hou&s;e,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Albany.</NOTE> for the convenience of collecting game. On this plantation Frog had placed <HI>Peter Stiver,</HI> a one-legged fellow, as his over&s;eer. As &s;oon as Peter heard of the quarrel between his ma&s;ter and Gu&s;tavus, he thought the quicke&s;t way of ending it was the be&s;t; and therefore, without waiting for orders or ceremony, he went and commanded Ca&s;imir off the ground; and with one of
<PB N="52" REF="030051_0051_0FE4160B62F2C318">
his crutches beat his hou&s;e to pieces about his ears. The poor fellow &s;tared at this rough treatment; but was glad to e&s;cape with whole bones, and humbly reque&s;ted leave to remain there with his tools, prom|i&s;ing to follow his bu&s;ine&s;s quietly, and become an obedient &s;ervant to Mr. Frog. Upon the&s;e conditions he was permitted to remain, and the whole tract was reputed Frog's property.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e things were doing, John Bull was confined to his hou&s;e with a vio|lent fever and delirium, which ended in the hypochondria,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The civil wars in England.</NOTE> and his imagination was the &s;eat of every wild freak and &s;trange vagary. One while he fancied him&s;elf an ab&s;olute monarch; then, a pre&s;byterian clergyman; then a general of hor&s;e; then a lord protector: His noddle was filled with a jumble of polemic divinity, political di&s;putes, and military arrangements, and it was not till after much blood-letting, bli&s;tering, vomiting, purging, cold-bathing,
<PB N="53" REF="030051_0052_0FE4160D10625218">
and hor&s;e-trotting, that he began to mend. Under this &s;evere but whole&s;ome regimen, he at length grew cool and came to him|&s;elf, but found on his recovery that his af|fairs had gone behind hand during his &s;ickne&s;s. Be&s;ide the lo&s;s of bu&s;ine&s;s, he had phy&s;icians' and apothecaries' bills to pay, and tho&s;e who had attended upon him as nur&s;es, watchers, porters, &amp;c. all expected wages or douceurs, and were con|tinually haunting him with, "How does your honor do? I am glad to &s;ee your honor &s;o well as to be abroad." They were continually putting them&s;elves in his way; and if they did not directly <HI>dun</HI> him for payment, their looks were &s;o &s;ignificant that a man of le&s;s penetration could ea&s;ily have gue&s;&s;ed what was their meaning.</P>
<P>BULL was &s;omewhat perplexed how to an&s;wer all their demands and expectations. He was too far behind hand to be able to &s;atisfy them, and withal too generous to let them remain unpaid. At length he hit on this expedient: "The&s;e fellows, &s;aid
<PB N="54" REF="030051_0053_0FE4160F0B746F20">
he to him&s;elf, have &s;erved me well, and may be of u&s;e to me again. There is yet a con&s;iderable part of my fore&s;t unoccupied. I'll offer to lea&s;e them tracts of land which <HI>co&s;t me nothing,</HI> and if they will accept them at a low rent, they may prove u&s;eful &s;er|vants, and I &s;hall be a gainer as well as they." Having come to this re&s;olution, he began to inquire into the affairs of his for|e&s;t, and found that his neighbours had in|truded upon his claim. Lewis had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at one end;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Canada, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the French.</NOTE> Lord Strut at the other;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Florida, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards.</NOTE> Nicholas Frog in the middle,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">New Am&s;terdam and the New Netherlands, by the Dutch.</NOTE> and his own tenants had heen quarrelling with their new neighbours, as well as among them&s;elves. "Hey-day! &s;ays John, this will never do; I mu&s;t keep a good look out upon the&s;e dogs, or they will get the advantage of me." Away he goes to Frog, and begun to complain of the ill treatment which he had received. Frog, who had
<PB N="55" REF="030051_0054_0FE41612E2F3B160">
no mind either to quarrel, or to cry <HI>peccavi,</HI> like a &s;ly, eva&s;ive whore-&s;on as he was, &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders, di&s;owned what his &s;ervants had done, and &s;aid, "he &s;up|po&s;ed they only meant to kill game, and did not intend to hold po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion." Bull was not to be put off &s;o; his blood was up, and he determined to treat Frog's &s;er|vants as they had treated Ca&s;imir. So, calling a tru&s;ty old &s;tud out of his compting hou&s;e, "Here Bob,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Robert Carr's expedition again&s;t New Am|&s;terdam, now New York.</NOTE> &s;aid he, take one of my hunters with a pair of blood-hounds, and go to that part of the fore&s;t where Pe|ter Stiver has encroached, give him fair warning; tell him the land is mine, and I will have it; if he gives up at once, treat him well, and tell him I'll give him leave to remain there; but if he offers to make any re&s;i&s;tance, or he&s;itates about an an&s;wer, &s;et your dogs at him and drive him off; kill his cattle, and &s;et his hou&s;e on fire: Never fear, I'll bear you out in it." Away goes Bob, and delivered his me&s;&s;age.
<PB N="56" REF="030051_0055_0FE41614D98BBFC8">
Peter at fir&s;t thought it a matter of amu&s;e|ment, and began to divert him&s;elf with it; but as &s;oon as the dogs opened upon him, he found his mi&s;take, and rather than run the ri&s;k of being driven off, he quietly &s;ub|mitted to the conditions propo&s;ed. "Hang it, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, what care I who is my landlord? Gain is my object; I have already been at great expen&s;e, and have a pro&s;pect of getting an e&s;tate. To remove will ruin me; I'll therefore &s;tay here, and make money under Bull, or Frog, or any other ma&s;ter that will let me &s;tay."</P>
<P>IN a &s;ub&s;equent quarrel which happened between Bull and Frog, the latter &s;eized upon this plantation again, and Peter re|cognized his old ma&s;ter; but upon a com|promi&s;e it was given up to Bull in exchange for a tract of &s;wamp<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Surrinam.</NOTE> which lay far to the &s;outhward. Peter continued on the ground through all the&s;e changes, and followed his bu&s;ine&s;s with great diligence, collecting game and pelts, and vending them &s;ome|times
<PB N="57" REF="030051_0056_0FE4161687CB4510">
to Mr. Bull, and &s;ometimes to Mr. Frog. However, Bull thought it be&s;t, that in token of &s;ubjection, he &s;hould change his name; to which he con&s;ented, and partly to plea&s;e his new ma&s;ter, and partly to retain the remembrance of his old one, he dropped the name of <HI>Stiver,</HI> and a&s;|&s;umed the name of <HI>Bullfrog.</HI></P>
<P>THE whole tract which was thus gotten from Frog, was thought too large for one plantation, and therefore Mr. Bull, in pur|&s;uance of the plan which he had formed, ap|propriated the rents of the plantation, on which Bullfrog was &s;eated, to his brother,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Duke of York.</NOTE> and the other was lea&s;ed to two of his &s;er|vants, CART-RUT and BARE-CLAY, and &s;ome time after another tract was &s;et off to WIL|LIAM BROADBRIM, who&s;e father had been an a&s;&s;iduous rat-catcher in Bull's family; but more of this hereafter.</P>
<P>CART-RUT and <HI>Bare-clay</HI> agreed to divide their land into two farms, which they call|ed
<PB N="58" REF="030051_0057_0FE4161877F6A130">
the ea&s;t and we&s;t farms; but when they came to run the divi&s;ion line, their com|pa&s;&s;es differed &s;o much that they could not fix the boundary. This was one cau&s;e of di&s;&s;ention. Another was the different hu|mours and di&s;po&s;itions of their families. Tho&s;e on the ea&s;t farm were brought up under Mr. Bull's &s;i&s;ter PEG, and as it is well known that &s;he and her brother had long been at variance, &s;o their dome&s;tics had got tinctured with the notions and prej|udices of their re&s;pective families. The family on the we&s;t farm was made up of per&s;ons who were &s;ubject to the epidemic ague or &s;haking pal&s;y;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Quakers.</NOTE> with &s;ome &s;trag|glers from Bullfrog's and Ca&s;imir's families. From this diver&s;ity of con&s;titutions and hu|mours aro&s;e bickerings and quarrels, a di&s;|inclination to work and &s;ubmit to family government. The&s;e di&s;orders continued a long while, and bu&s;ine&s;s went on very &s;low|ly, till at length the heads of both families agreed to give up their &s;eparate lea&s;es, and take a new one of the whole, and let Mr.
<PB N="59" REF="030051_0058_0FE4161C21CE30A8">
Bull appoint an over&s;eer. By the&s;e means peace was re&s;tored, and the new over&s;eer, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a de&s;cendant of a natural &s;on of JULIUS CAESAR, gave the name of his ance&s;tor to the farm, which has ever &s;ince been called CAESAREA.</P>
<P>THERE was another portion of the for|e&s;t, which lay &s;outhward of Walter Pipe|weed's plantation, and which no per&s;on had yet taken up, though &s;ome had made attempts and had been driven off by the numberle&s;s mu&s;quetoes and &s;and-flies, which abound in tho&s;e places. Mr. Bull was &s;till de&s;irous to reward his friends in the <HI>cheape&s;t manner,</HI> and at the &s;ame time to keep his neighbours from encroaching upon him, and &s;ecure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fore&s;t to him&s;elf. In pur&s;uance of his plan, and to make &s;hort work of it at once, he lea&s;ed the whole of this &s;outhern extremity to CHARLES INDIGO, who was expre&s;sly order|ed to take under his care and into his fami|ly all per&s;ons who had attended Mr. Bull, in his late &s;ickne&s;s, in quality of nur&s;es,
<PB N="60" REF="030051_0059_0FE4161E30378568">
druggi&s;ts, apothecaries, laundre&s;&s;es, uphol|&s;ters, porters, watchers, &amp;c. &amp;c. By this order Charles found him&s;elf at once &s;ur|rounded by a large body of retainers of various ranks and qualities, and, being a &s;peculator him&s;elf, he employed a &s;pecula|tive man, Mr. <HI>Padlock,</HI> who had written a large treati&s;e upon <HI>Ideas,</HI> to draw up &s;ome rules, for the management of &s;uch a fami|ly, intending when he &s;hould build an hou&s;e, to pa&s;te it up in the parlour, as a di|rectory to his wife. Accordingly Mr. Pad|lock went to work, and with an exqui&s;ite mixture of political and metaphy&s;ical knowl|edge, di&s;tingui&s;hed between the hall, the par|lour, the dre&s;&s;ing-room, the gallery, the mu|&s;ic-room, the bed-chambers, the chapel, the kitchen, the water-clo&s;et, &amp;c. &s;hewing what was to be done in each, and the prop|er &s;ubordination of one to the other, all which would have been of excellent &s;ervice in a palace, and among people who had got to a high degree of refinement, but was ill &s;uited to the circum&s;tances of new adven|turers
<PB N="61" REF="030051_0060_0FE4161FDC2EA920">
in a fore&s;t. They rather needed to be in&s;tructed in the method of felling trees, draining &s;wamps, digging clams, guard|ing again&s;t mu&s;quetoes, killing wolves and bears, and erecting huts to keep off the weather. To the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary affairs they were obliged to attend, and Mr. Padlock's fine &s;pun rules were laid by and little thought of.</P>
<P>CHARLES had pitched upon a &s;andy point, between two brooks, for his man&s;ion hou&s;e, and had made a &s;mall beginning, when his repo&s;e was di&s;turbed by one AU|GUSTINE, a lubberly fellow, who had taken a lea&s;e of Lord Strut, and lived farther &s;outhward. This Strut was the large&s;t landholder in the country, and was never &s;atisfied with adding field to field. He had already got much mere than he could man|age, and had greatly impoveri&s;hed his home&s;tead by attending to his extra territo|ries. His tenants were infected with the &s;ame land fever, and wi&s;hed to have no neighbours within &s;ight or call. With this
<PB N="62" REF="030051_0061_0FE41621D39C2058">
envious di&s;po&s;ition, Augu&s;tine collected a rabble of lou&s;y fellows, and was coming to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s Charles, thinking him too weak to make a defence; but Charles was a lad of too much <HI>&s;punk</HI> to be brow-beaten. He armed all his people with &s;ome weapon or other, and advanced till he came with|in &s;ight of the place where Augu&s;tine was, who, on &s;eeing him, took wit in his anger, and went back, without attempting any mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>ANOTHER difficulty which Charles ex|pected to encounter was from the wild bea&s;ts; but luckily for him, the&s;e creatures got into a quarrel among them&s;elves, and fought with each other till they had thin|ned their numbers con&s;iderably, &s;o that Charles and his companions could venture into the woods, where they caught &s;ome few and tamed them, as was the u&s;ual prac|tice among all Mr. Bull's tenants at that day. Of this practice a more particular ac|count &s;hall be given in my next letter.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>BULL</HI>'s Project of taming wild Animals. &mdash;Its Execution by his Tenants.&mdash;Their dif|ferent Notions and Conduct in this Matter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU mu&s;t have remarked in your acquaintance with the life and character of Mr. John Bull, that he is very whim&s;ical, and as po&s;itive as whim&s;ical. Among oth|er advantages which he expected from the &s;ettlement of his Fore&s;t, one was, that the wild animals, whom nature had made fero|cious and untractable in the highe&s;t degree, would be rendered tame and &s;erviceable, by receiving in&s;truction and education from the nurturing hand of humanity. He had con|ceived a notion that every creature has certain
<PB N="64" REF="030051_0063_0FE41628806593E8">
latent principles and qualities which form a foundation for improvement; and he thought it a great piece of inju&s;tice that the&s;e qualities &s;hould be &s;uffered to remain uncultivated: he had a mind that experi|ments &s;hould be attempted to di&s;cover how far this kind of cultivation was practicable, and what u&s;e could be made of the animal powers under the direction and control of rational government. Full of this idea, he came to a re&s;olution, that it &s;hould be the duty of every one of his tenants to catch wild bea&s;ts of various &s;orts, and di&s;cipline them &s;o as to find out their &s;everal proper|ties and capacities, and u&s;e them accord|ingly; and this kind of &s;ervice was men|tioned in their re&s;pective lea&s;es as one con|dition of the grants.</P>
<P>SOME of the tenants, particularly Pere|grine Pickle, John Codline, and Humphry Plough&s;hare, entered zealou&s;ly into the mea&s;|ure from principle. They had, during Mr. Bull's &s;ickne&s;s and delirium, before &s;poken of, formed an a&s;&s;ociation for their mutual

&s;afety.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The united colonies of New England, 1643.</NOTE> The object of their union was two fold: fir&s;t, to endeavour by all fair means to tame and di&s;cipline the wild bea&s;ts; and &s;econdly, in ca&s;e of their prov|ing refractory, to defend them&s;elves again&s;t their attacks. The other tenants did &s;ome|thing in the &s;ame way; &s;ome from one principle, and &s;ome from another. Peter Bullfrog, who was as cunning as any of them, made u&s;e of tho&s;e which he had tamed, as his caterers, to provide game for his table, of which the feathers and furs &s;erved him as articles of traffic, and brought him in a profitable return.</P>
<P>THE principal con&s;ideration (&s;etting a&s;ide intere&s;t) which induced the more zealous of the Fore&s;ters to enter into this bu&s;ine&s;s, was an idea that the&s;e animals were a de|generated part of the human &s;pecies, and might be re&s;tored to their proper rank and order, if due pains were taken. The grounds of this opinion were the&s;e: Among the traditions of the ancient Druids there was
<PB N="66" REF="030051_0065_0FE4162C213CCDE8">
a &s;tory, that out of <HI>twelve</HI> families which inhabited a certain di&s;trict by them&s;elves, <HI>ten</HI> had been lo&s;t, and no account could be given of them; and, where, &s;aid they, is it more likely to find them than in this fore&s;t, in the &s;hape of &s;ome other creatures? e&s;pe|cially, if the doctrine of TRANSMIGRATION, which the Druids held, be true. Another tradition was, that one of Mr. Bull's great-great-uncles, by the name of <HI>Madok,</HI> had many years ago di&s;appeared, and the la&s;t account which had been received of him was, that he had been &s;een going towards this fore&s;t; hence it was concluded that his de&s;cendants mu&s;t be found here. In con|firmation of this argument, it was alleged, that the &s;ounds which &s;ome of the&s;e crea|tures made in their howlings, re&s;embled the language &s;poken in that day: nay, &s;ome were po&s;itive that they had heard them pro|nounce the word <HI>Madokawando</HI>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name of a Sachem, at Penob&s;cot.</NOTE> and one hunter roundly &s;wore that he had &s;een in the den of a bear, an old <HI>book</HI> which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be a <HI>Bible</HI> written in the Celtic
<PB N="67" REF="030051_0066_0FE41631B9819A78">
language, and this book they concluded mu&s;t have been left there by <HI>Madok,</HI> who could read and &s;peak no other language. Another very material circum&s;tance was the di&s;covery of a rock by the &s;ide of a brook,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The celebrated rock at Dighton, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</NOTE> in&s;cribed with &s;ome characters which bore no re&s;emblance to any kind of writing, ancient or modern; the conclu&s;ion from hence was, that it mu&s;t be of the re|mote&s;t antiquity: this rock was deemed an unaccountable curio&s;ity, till a certain virtu|o&s;o took it into his noddle, fir&s;t to imagine, and then to become extremely po&s;itive that the characters were <HI>Punic</HI>; and finally this in&s;cription was tran&s;lated, and affirmed to be nothing le&s;s than a treaty of alliance and commerce between the <HI>Phenicians</HI> and the fir&s;t inhabitants of this fore&s;t. From all the&s;e premi&s;es it was inferred, with &s;ome plau&s;ibility, and more po&s;itivene&s;s, that one &s;pecies at lea&s;t of the &s;avage animals was de&s;cended from <HI>Madok,</HI> and that the others were the po&s;terity of the long lo&s;t <HI>ten</HI> fam|ilies, who were well known to have had a
<PB N="68" REF="030051_0067_0FE4163364BE0D38">
commercial connexion with the <HI>Phenicians,</HI> and that the&s;e probably found out their haunt, and followed them for the &s;ake of their former friend&s;hip.&mdash;What happy light do modern di&s;coveries and conjectures throw on the dark pages of antiquity.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e principles, as well as from motives of humanity and of intere&s;t, &s;ome of the Fore&s;ters entered with zeal on the con&s;ideration and practice of the be&s;t meth|ods to fulfil this condition of their grants, the di&s;ciplining of the &s;avage animals, and they certainly de&s;erve prai&s;e for their hone&s;t endeavours; but, others who pretended to the &s;ame zeal, it is to be lamented, made u&s;e of this pretence to cover their vanity or their avarice. Had none but gentle means been u&s;ed, it is probable more good might, on the whole, have been produced; but as it often happens that many a good project has been ruined for want of pru|dence in the execution, &s;o it fared with this; for while the new comers were bu&s;y in putting up their huts, and preparing the
<PB N="69" REF="030051_0068_0FE416355A85EEA8">
land for cultivation, both of which were nece&s;&s;ary before they could attend to any other bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ome of the &s;avage tribe would be a little impertinent, either by peeping into the huts, or breaking up a ne&s;t where the poultry were hatching, or carrying off a chick or a go&s;ling. The&s;e impertinencies bred frequent quarrels, and the poor creatures were &s;ometimes driven off with bloody no&s;es, or obliged to hop on three legs, or even laid &s;prawling and &s;lyly covered with earth, no &s;ervice or ceremony being &s;aid over the carca&s;s, and no other epitaph, than "Poh, they are nothing but brutes, and where's the harm of killing them!" or in rhyme thus:</P>
<L>"Tit for tat, tit for tat,</L>
<L>"He &s;tole my chick, and I broke his back."</L>
<P>WHATEVER plau&s;ible excu&s;es might have been made for the&s;e proceedings, they &s;erv|ed to render the creatures jealous of their new neighbours; but in&s;tead of abating their appetite for mi&s;chief, it &s;harpened their invention to take more &s;ly methods of
<PB N="70" REF="030051_0069_0FE416615B2A50B0">
accompli&s;hing it. The more wary of them kept aloof in the day time, and would not be enticed by the arts which were u&s;ed to draw them in; however, they were &s;ome|times pinched for food, and the new inhab|itants u&s;ed to throw cru&s;ts of bread, hand|fuls of corn, and other eatables, in their way, which allured them by degrees to familiarity. After a while it was found that nothing &s;ucceeded &s;o well as <HI>mola&s;&s;es.</HI> It was therefore thought a capital manoeu|vre to drop a train of it on the ground, which the creatures would follow, licking it, till they had in&s;en&s;ibly got up to the doors of the hou&s;es, where if any body held a bowl or a plate be&s;meared with the liquor, they would come and put their no&s;es into it, and then you might pat them on the back and &s;ides, or &s;troke them, &s;ay|ing, "Poor Bruin, poor I&s;grim, poor Rey|nard, poor Pu&s;s," and the like, and they would &s;uffer them&s;elves to be handled and fondled till they dropped a&s;leep. When they awaked, they would make a moan and wag their tails, as if they were a&s;king for
<PB N="71" REF="030051_0070_0FE4163705FA3E30">
more, and if it was denied them, they would retire to the woods in di&s;gu&s;t, till the &s;cent of the mola&s;&s;es operating on their depraved appetites, invited them to return where it was to be had. This was, upon repeated trial, found to be the mo&s;t effect|ual way of taming them, as they might be taught to imitate any kind of tricks and ge&s;tures, if a di&s;h of mola&s;&s;es was held out as a reward.</P>
<P>THE Fore&s;ters knew that they could not ingratiate them&s;elves better with their old ma&s;ter Bull, than by humouring his itch for projects. They therefore took care to rai&s;e reports and write letters from time to time concerning the wonderful &s;ucce&s;s which they had met with in civilizing the &s;avage animals. Bull was greatly plea&s;ed with the&s;e reports, and made a practice of &s;ending pre&s;ents of trinkets to be di&s;tributed among them; &s;uch as collars, ear-rings, and no&s;e-jewels. Several times &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;tately and be&s;t in&s;tructed of them were carried to his hou&s;e for a &s;how, where
<PB N="72" REF="030051_0071_0FE4163ACEBDA2C8">
he had them dre&s;&s;ed up in &s;carlet and gold trappings, and led through all his apart|ments for the entertainment of his family, and fea&s;ted with every nick-nack which his cook and confectioner could procure. He was &s;o fond of being thought their patron and protector, that he u&s;ually &s;poke of them as his <HI>red children,</HI> from the colour of their hides. It is not many years &s;ince one of them, after being led through &s;everal fam|ilies and plantations of the tenants, was carried by a certain <HI>witty cur,</HI> to Mr. Bull's own hou&s;e, dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of a <HI>clergy|man,</HI> having been previou&s;ly taught to lift his paws and roll his eyes, as if in the act of devotion. This trick was &s;o well carried on, that the managers of it picked up a large pocket full of pence, by exhibiting him for a raree &s;how, and the money was applied toward building a <HI>menagerie,</HI> to which bea&s;ts of all kinds might be brought and tamed. This project, like many &s;uch whims, has made more noi&s;e than profit; for mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be tamed and dome&s;ticated, after they had been &s;ent back
<PB N="73" REF="030051_0072_0FE4163C784F1D88">
to their native woods, with a view to their being in&s;trumental in taming their fellow &s;avages, have returned to their former fe|rocious habits, and &s;ome of them have proved greater rogues than ever, and have done more mi&s;chief than they could other|wi&s;e have been capable of.</P>
<P>MR. Bull him&s;elf was once &s;o full of the project, that he got his chaplain and &s;ome others to form them&s;elves into a club; the profe&s;&s;ed object of which was, to <HI>propagate knowledge</HI> among the&s;e &s;avage creatures. After &s;ome trials, which did not an&s;wer ex|pectation, old Madam Bull conceived that the money which was collected might as well be expended in teaching Mr. Bull's own tenants them&s;elves a little better man|ners; for &s;ome of them were rather awk|ward and &s;lovenly in their deportment, while others were decent and devout <HI>in their own way.</HI> Madam, as we have before ob&s;erved, was a great zealot in the cau&s;e of <HI>uniformity,</HI> and had a va&s;t influence over her &s;on, by virtue of which, the attention of
<PB N="74" REF="030051_0073_0FE4163E2890DB70">
the club was principally directed to the promoting of this grand object. Accord|ingly, every one of the tenants was furni&s;h|ed with a Bible and a Prayer Book, a clean napkin, ba&s;on, platter, and chalice, with a few devotional tracts, and &s;ome young ad|venturers who had been educated in the family, were recommended as chaplains; who had al&s;o by-orders to keep a look out toward the &s;avage animals, when they &s;hould fall in their way.</P>
<P>THE chaplains were tolerably well receiv|ed in mo&s;t of the families; but &s;ome, par|ticularly Codline and Plough&s;hare, who gloried in being able to &s;ay their prayers <HI>without book,</HI> always looked &s;our upon them, and would frequently &s;ay to them, "Go, take care of the &s;avage objects of your mi&s;|&s;ion, and don't come here to teach us, till you have learned better your&s;elves." The chaplains in di&s;gu&s;t, and perhaps in revenge, (for they were but men of like pa&s;&s;ions) would pout and &s;well and call <HI>&s;chi&s;matic</HI> and other canonical nick-names, of which there
<PB N="75" REF="030051_0074_0FE4164032015C70">
is extant a large vocabulary, and would fre|quently write letters, much to the di&s;ad|vantage of their opponents. It is not many years &s;ince they, with the club which &s;ent them, were pretty &s;everely handled by one of Codline's own chaplains,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. M&mdash;y&mdash;w.</NOTE> and it is &s;up|po&s;ed that they have ever &s;ince been more mode&s;t; certain it is, that they are now on better terms with their neighbours than formerly; this may, in part, be owing to Mr. Bull's de&s;erting them and refu&s;ing to pay them for their &s;ervices ever &s;ince the time that he began to quarrel with his ten|ants. On that occa&s;ion &s;ome of them re|moved their quarters; others kept their old places, and have got along as well as they could without the help which they formerly received.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Adventures of <HI>CHARLES INDIGO</HI> and <HI>PETER PITCH.</HI>&mdash;Character of <HI>WILLIAM BROAD|BRIM.</HI> &mdash;His Projects, Principles, and a Specimen of his Harangues.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ob&s;erved in a former let|ter, that the lea&s;e which Mr. Bull gave to Charles Indigo, obliged him to receive into his family all &s;uch per&s;ons as had been at|tendants on Mr. Bull during his &s;ickne&s;s, and for whom he had no other means of providing. This general indulgence pro|cured to Charles the reputation of a very friendly, ho&s;pitable per&s;on, and induced great numbers of other people of various characters, views, and intere&s;ts, to &s;eek an
<PB N="77" REF="030051_0076_0FE4164548078AC0">
a&s;ylum within his limits. About this time Mr. Lewis had grown &s;ick and peevi&s;h, and had &s;everely cudgelled &s;ome of his appren|tices, becau&s;e they did not make their P's and Q's exactly to his mind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Revocation of the edict of Nantz, by Lewis XIV. 168<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> The poor fellows, to prevent wor&s;e treatment, fled from his hou&s;e, and took refuge with Mr. Bull, who treated them civilly, and recom|mended them to the Fore&s;t, where they di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves in the &s;everal families of his tenants, and a large party of them took up their abode with Charles, to whom they proved an indu&s;trious, profitable ac|qui&s;ition, though &s;ome of the family looked a little &s;ourly upon them.</P>
<P>THIS facility of admitting &s;trangers pro|duced an effect which had almo&s;t proved fatal to the reputation of the family; for a number of <HI>highwaymen</HI> al&s;o &s;ought &s;helter there, and by means of their gold and &s;ilver, which they had in plenty, made friends in the hou&s;e, and were admitted by night
<PB N="78" REF="030051_0077_0FE4164738359E30">
at a back door. After a while they grew more bold, and came in the day time, un|der the di&s;gui&s;e of pedlars, with packs on their &s;houlders. One of them actually took his &s;tand behind a corner of one of the fences, from whence he &s;allied out on travellers; this corner obtained, from that circum&s;tance, the name of <HI>Cape Fear;</HI> and as the fir&s;t names of places are not ea&s;ily got rid of, it retains the name to this day, and perhaps will ever retain it. Here the ra&s;cal intended to have built him&s;elf a lodge, and taken up his quarters for life; but the matter was now grown &s;o public, that Charles, for the honour of his family, or|dered all &s;tragglers to be &s;eized, and this fellow in particular, after a &s;evere &s;trug|gle, was apprehended and brought to ju&s;|tice.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame &s;pot was afterward taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of by PETER PITCH, a poor fellow who got his living as he did his name, from collecting the re&s;mous juice of the numerous pines which grew thereabout.
<PB N="79" REF="030051_0078_0FE41648E3370B90">
He had to work hard and fare hard, and go a great way for his victuals and clothes; but after he had lived alone for &s;ome time, he picked up one or two acquaintances of his own &s;tamp, and they formed a family, which was at fir&s;t rather di&s;orderly. Far|ther di&s;covery of the lands, and the advan|tage of the water carriage, induced &s;ome other people to &s;it down by him, and in proce&s;s of time he became &s;o re&s;pectable as to be noticed by Mr. Bull, who, though he never gave him a lea&s;e in form, yet let him have cloth and haberda&s;hery upon credit, and took his pitch in payment as fa&s;t as he could collect it. This kept him in a dependent &s;tate, and &s;ubjected him to impo&s;itions from Bull's clerks and journey|men. About five and twenty years ago, Bull &s;ent him a taylor to <HI>try on</HI> a new coat,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In&s;urrections in North Carolina, 1771.</NOTE> which was &s;o &s;trait that it &s;plit in &s;everal places, and never could be altered &s;o as to fit him; but he was obliged to wear it, rather than quarrel with his patron. This &s;ame taylor was remarkable for <HI>cabbaging,</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="030051_0079_0FE4164BD4E90700">
as Peter Bullfrog and Humphry Plough|&s;hare have &s;ince had large experience.</P>
<P>TO fini&s;h what relates to Charles Indigo, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that the land on which he began his plantation, was in general &s;o wet and miry, that it was unfavourable to the production of wheat, and it was for &s;ome time doubtful whether he would be able to rai&s;e his own bread. Chance at length effected what labour and ingenuity could not: a bird of pa&s;&s;age having dropped &s;ome kernels of rice in his dung, it was found to thrive exceedingly well; from whence the hint was taken, and rice became the &s;tandard grain of the plantation. By the cultivation of this, and of a weed which was u&s;eful to the dyers, he grew rich, and made a &s;ightly figure among his neighbours in point of dre&s;s and equipage; though his countenance is rather &s;allow, and he is &s;ubject to frequent returns of the inter|mittent fever.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="030051_0080_0FE4164E06BB1D30">BY the exten&s;ive lea&s;e given to Indigo and his a&s;&s;ociates, mo&s;t of Mr. Bull's de|pendants and attendants were provided for, and their &s;ervices recompen&s;ed with a &s;hew of genero&s;ity on his part, and of &s;atisfac|tion on theirs. I have before ju&s;t hinted at a grant made to WILLIAM BROADBRIM, of which I &s;hall now give a more particu|lar account.</P>
<P>HIS father had been an old &s;ervant of Mr. Bull, and had been employed in the very laborious and nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of catching and killing rats. In this employ|ment he was &s;o very dexterous and &s;uc|ce&s;sful, that he recommended him&s;elf high|ly to his ma&s;ter, who not only allowed him large wages, but promi&s;ed him farther recompen&s;e. During Mr. Bull's &s;ickne&s;s, the care and diligence of this faithful &s;er|vant had been unremitted, and his merits were thereby increa&s;ed, &s;o that Mr. Bull, on his recovery, found him&s;elf deeply in|debted to him, and he &s;till continued his &s;ervices&punc; till, worn out with age and in|firmity,
<PB N="82" REF="030051_0081_0FE4165000A1B288">
he died and had an honourable funeral.</P>
<P>HIS &s;on William then became his heir, and &s;olicited for payment of the arrears due to his father, which Mr. Bull, accord|ing to the maxim he had laid down for him&s;elf, and urged by the nece&s;&s;ity of the occa&s;ion, propo&s;ed to di&s;charge by a lea&s;e of part of the Fore&s;t. This happened to fall in, exactly, with William's views, which were of a &s;ingular nature.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time a nervous di&s;order ap|peared in Bull's family, which went by the name of the <HI>&s;haking pal&s;y.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quakeri&s;m.</NOTE> We &s;hall not pretend to trace the cau&s;es of it, as the origin of &s;uch things is often ob&s;cure and impenetrable; but the effects were, a trembling of the nerves, a &s;tiffne&s;s in the neck and &s;houlders, and a he&s;itancy in the &s;peech, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the patients to incline the head, or pronounce certain words and &s;yllables, &s;uch as Sir,

Madam, your Honor, my Lord, &amp;c. nor could one of them rai&s;e his hand to take off his hat, or hold it on the book when an oath was to be admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>MR. Bull's choleric temper mi&s;inter|preted this natural infirmity into a &s;ullen di&s;re&s;pect. When he found a change in the behaviour of the&s;e dome&s;tics; that in|&s;tead of bowing to him they &s;tood upright as a may-pole, and in&s;tead of Sir, and your Honor, they could utter nothing but <HI>Friend,</HI> he grew angry, and made a pretty free u&s;e of his fi&s;t; and when he found that they could not be cured by &s;uch means, he thru&s;t &s;ome of them into a dark clo&s;et, and &s;hut them up till they &s;hould, as he termed it, "learn better manners;" and it is &s;uppo&s;|ed he would have carried his re&s;entment much further, but for this circum&s;tance: William Broadbrim, who had him&s;elf &s;trong &s;ymptoms of the di&s;order, whi&s;pered to Mr. Bull, that if he would give him time to ripen a project, which he had conceived, he would rid him of all trouble with the&s;e
<PB N="84" REF="030051_0083_0FE41651A7EFADB8">
people. William had a plodding genius, and the &s;cheme with which his head was pregnant at this time, was nothing more or le&s;s than to make a &s;ettlement in the fore&s;t, and take all the&s;e people with him. Bull, who was glad to get rid of them, and of the debt which he owed to William, readily fell in with the project; and a grant was made out under hand and &s;eal, where|in William Broadbrim, and his heirs, were inve&s;ted with the right of &s;oil, and all oth|er privileges of proprietor&s;hip, in a certain part of the fore&s;t, between the plantation of Marygold and that of Cart-rut and Bare-clay, being in the neighbourhood of the &s;pot where Ca&s;imir had rebuilt his hut, and lived in an ambiguous &s;ituation, not know|ing who was his landlord. With him Wil|liam made a peaceable compromi&s;e, &s;aying, "Friend, I will do thee no violence, there is room enough for us both." Ca&s;imir was glad of &s;o good a neighbour, and he had rea&s;on to be, for he throve more rapidly af|ter this than before.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="030051_0084_0FE41655935DB7C8">WILLIAM pitched upon a level piece of ground, where two large brooks met, for the &s;ituation of his man&s;ion hou&s;e, and went to work to draw up rules for the gov|ernment of his family. One of which was, that no per&s;on &s;hould be refu&s;ed admittance into it, or di&s;turbed in it, or ca&s;t out of it, on account of any natural infirmity. Anoth|er was, that no arms nor ammunition &s;hould ever be made u&s;e of, on any pretence what|ever. The fir&s;t of the&s;e rules gained Wil|liam great reputation among all &s;en&s;ible men; the latter was a notion which candor would lead us to &s;uppo&s;e proceeded from a love of peace, and the exerci&s;e of good will toward his fellow-creatures; though &s;ome were &s;o ill-natured as to imagine that it was an effect of the di&s;order in his nerves.</P>
<P>WHEN any of William's neighbours, who were of a different way of thinking, &s;pake to him of the impolicy of this rule, and a&s;k|ed him how he expected to defend him&s;elf and his family again&s;t the wild bea&s;ts, if they &s;hould attack him; William, who was

fond of harangue, would an&s;wer thus&mdash; "There is in all creatures a certain in|&s;tinct, which di&s;po&s;eth them to peace. This in&s;tinct is &s;o &s;trong and fixed, that upon it, as upon a foundation, may be erected a complete &s;y&s;tem of love and concord, which all the powers of anarchy &s;hall not be able to overthrow. To cultivate and improve this in&s;tinct, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of every wi&s;e man, and he may rea&s;onably expect that an example of this kind, if &s;teadily and regu|larly adhered to, will have a very exten&s;ive and beneficial influence, on all &s;orts of creatures; even the wild bea&s;ts of the for|e&s;t will become tame as lambs, and birds of prey harmle&s;s as doves. Do&s;t thou not &s;ee, friend, what influence my example has already had on tho&s;e creatures which are deemed &s;avage? I go into their dens with &s;afety, and they enter my habitation without fear. When they are hungry I feed them, when they are thir&s;ty I give them drink, and they in return bear my burdens, and do &s;uch other kind offices as they are capa|ble of, end I require of them. I have even

tamed &s;ome of them &s;o far, that they have &s;old me the land on which they live, and have acknowledged the bargain by a mark made with their toe-nails on parchment. They are certainly &s;ome of the be&s;t natured creatures in the world; their native in&s;tinct leads them to love and peace, and &s;ociabil|ity; and as long as I &s;et them a good exam|ple, I have no doubt they will follow it. When &s;uch is my opinion and expectation, why &s;hould I be anxious about what may, and I tru&s;t never will happen? Why &s;hould I put my&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence again&s;t tho&s;e who may never attack me? or, why &s;hould I, by the appearance of jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t on my part, offend tho&s;e who now put confidence in me? No, no, I will not &s;up|po&s;e that they will ever hurt me. I will not &s;uffer the <HI>carnal weapon</HI> to be &s;een in my hou&s;e, nor &s;hall one of my family ever learn the dete&s;table practice of pulling the <HI>trigger.</HI> I leave the in&s;truments of de&s;truction to the off&s;pring of Cain and the &s;eed of the &s;erpent; whil&s;t I meekly imitate the gen|tlene&s;s

<P>WITH &s;uch harangues William would frequently entertain him&s;elf and his friends, and he was &s;o &s;anguine in his benevolent project, that in&s;tead of having his own name, as was u&s;ual, written over his door, he had the words BROTHERLY LOVE, tran&s;lated in|to the Greek language, &PHgr;&Igr;&Lgr;&Agr;&Dgr;&Egr;&Lgr;&PHgr;&Igr;&Agr;, and in&s;cribed in golden characters, as a &s;tand|ing invitation to per&s;ons of all nations and characters, to come and take &s;helter under his roof.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE general invitation which Wil|liam Broadbrim had given to all per&s;ons who were de&s;titute of a home, to come and take &s;helter under his roof, and the gentle, humane treatment which tho&s;e who accepted the invitation met with, &s;pread his fame abroad, and brought him much company. His family was &s;ometimes com|pared
<PB N="90" REF="030051_0089_0FE4168B4C36DC90">
to the Ark of Noah, becau&s;e there was &s;carcely any kind of being, of what|ever &s;hape, &s;ize, complexion, di&s;po&s;ition, or language, but what might be found there. He had al&s;o the art to keep them pretty well employed. Indu&s;try, frugality, and temperance, were the leading princi|ples of his family; and their thriving was in a ratio compounded of the&s;e three forces. Nothing was wanting to make them as happy a family as any in the world, but a di&s;po&s;ition <HI>among them&s;elves,</HI> to live in peace. Unluckily, this de&s;irable ble&s;&s;ing, on ac|count of the variety of their humours and intere&s;ts, was &s;eldom found among them. Ambition, jealou&s;y, avarice, and party &s;pirit, had frequent out-breakings, and were with difficulty quelled. It is needle&s;s to enter into a very particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the grounds or effects of the&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions: family quarrels are not very entertaining either at home or abroad, unle&s;s to &s;uch as delight in &s;candal. But there was one cau&s;e of di&s;&s;en&s;ion which it would be im|proper not to notice, becau&s;e I have already
<PB N="91" REF="030051_0090_0FE3F1AC2957ADE0">
hinted at the principle from which it pro|ceeded. William's aver&s;ion to fire-arms was &s;o &s;trong, that he would not &s;uffer any of his family to mole&s;t the wild inhabitants of the fore&s;t, though they were ever &s;o mi&s;chievous. While the family was &s;mall, the &s;avage animals who lived in the neigh|bourhood, being well fed, were tolerably tame and civil, but when the increa&s;ed number of the family had penetrated far|ther into the fore&s;t, the haunts of the na|tives were di&s;turbed, and the &s;traggling labourers were &s;ometimes &s;urpri&s;ed, and having nothing to defend them&s;elves with, fell a &s;acrifice to &s;avage re&s;entment. Re|mon&s;trances were pre&s;ented to Mr. Broad|brim one after another, but he always in|&s;i&s;ted on it that the &s;ufferer mu&s;t have been the aggre&s;&s;or, and that "they who take the &s;word, mu&s;t expect to peri&s;h by the &s;word." At length the dead corp&s;e of one of the labourers, mangled and torn in a dreadful manner, was brought and laid at the door of William's parlour,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State hou&s;e, 1755.</NOTE> with a label affixed

to the brea&s;t, on which were written the&s;e words, "Thou thy&s;elf mu&s;t be accounted my murderer, becau&s;e thou did&s;t deny me the means of defence." At &s;ight of this horrid &s;pectacle, Broadbrim turned pale! the eye of his mind looked inward! Nature began to plead her own cau&s;e within him! he gave way in &s;ome degree to her opera|tions, though contrary to his pre-conceived opinion, and with a trembling hand &s;igned a permi&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e to u&s;e the <HI>carnal weapon,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Militia act.</NOTE> who could do it without &s;cruple; and when they a&s;ked him for money to buy guns, powder and ball, he gave them a certain &s;um to provide <HI>the nece&s;&s;aries of life,</HI> leaving them to put their own con|&s;truction on the words. By degrees his &s;queami&s;hne&s;s decrea&s;ed, and though it is imagined he has &s;till &s;ome remainder of it, yet nece&s;&s;ity has &s;o often overcome it, that there is not much &s;aid on the &s;ubject, un|le&s;s it be very privately and among <HI>friends.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="030051_0092_0FE41668B0269960">DURING the time of which we have been &s;peaking, Mr. John Bull had undergone another &s;ickne&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Revolution, 1688.</NOTE> not &s;o long nor &s;o violent as the former, but much more beneficial in its effects. His new phy&s;icians had admin|i&s;tered medicines which compo&s;ed his nerves; he ate, drank, and &s;lept more regu|larly; and he was advi&s;ed to marry again, for his former wife had died of a con&s;ump|tion a little before this &s;ickne&s;s came on. By the&s;e means his vigour was renewed, but &s;till his whim&s;ical di&s;po&s;ition remained, and broke out on &s;everal occa&s;ions. When he viewed his exten&s;ive fore&s;t, now planted and thriving, under the hone&s;t hand of in|du&s;try, he thought within him&s;elf that &s;till greater advantages might be derived from that territory. There was yet a part of it un&s;ettled between the plantation of Charles Indigo, and the dominions of Lord Strut; and Bull thought it a pity to let &s;o much remain a wilderne&s;s. The other plantations had been made by di&s;contented &s;ervants and needy adventurers, who, &s;truggling

with hard&s;hips, by a &s;teady per&s;everance had &s;urmounted many difficulties, and obtained a comfortable living. "Now, &s;aid Bull, if the&s;e fellows have done &s;o well, and got &s;o far aforehand, without having any capital of their own to begin with, what cannot be done by the force of my great capital? If they have performed &s;uch wonders, what greater wonders may be brought into view by my own exertions, with all the advantages which it is in my power to command? To it, boys; I vow I'll have a farm of my own that &s;hall beat you all!"&mdash;Having hit upon this project, his brains immediately became pregnant with ideas; but according to the rule which he had lately pre&s;cribed to him|&s;elf, he communicated the matter to his wife. This good lady was not free from an ambitious turn of mind. She was ex|tremely fond of having it thought that &s;he had great influence over her hu&s;band, and would &s;ometimes gratify his humour at the expen&s;e of her own judgment, rather than not keep up this idea. His expectations from his new project were very &s;anguine.
<PB N="95" REF="030051_0094_0FE4166C54FCD550">
The land on which he had ca&s;t his eye was enough for a large farm; it had a &s;outhern expo&s;ure; it was warm, rich and fertile in &s;ome parts, and in others boggy or &s;andy. He had conver&s;ed with &s;ome foreigners, who told him that it was proper for the cultivation of wine and &s;ilk, and he imagin|ed that if he could but add the&s;e articles to the li&s;t of his own productions, there would be a great &s;aving in the family. Mrs. Bull too was plea&s;ed with the idea of having her &s;ilk gowns and ribbands of her own growth, and with the expectation of having the vaults filled with wine, made on her own plantation; for the&s;e and other good rea|&s;ons, her thereunto moving, Madam gave her con&s;ent to the project. The per&s;on appointed to carry it into execution was <HI>George Tru&s;ty,</HI> a &s;en&s;ible well bred merchant, but one who had only &s;peculated in the &s;cience of agriculture, and knew nothing of it by experience. Having collected a number of poor people who were out of employment, he &s;ent them to the &s;pot, with &s;trict orders to work &s;ix days in &s;even,
<PB N="96" REF="030051_0095_0FE4167036BB1008">
to keep their tools free from ru&s;t, and their fire-arms in readine&s;s for their defence. Whatever they &s;hould earn was to be <HI>their own</HI> as long as they lived, and after their death their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were to de&s;cend to their <HI>&s;ons,</HI> and in default of male i&s;&s;ue to revert to the original grantor. They were not allowed to u&s;e black cattle in the la|bour of the field; and were expre&s;sly for|bidden to drink grog. Their bu&s;ine&s;s was to cultivate vines and mulberry trees, and to manufacture wine and &s;ilk. Upon this project another was grafted by the very &s;agacious <HI>Doctor Squintum,</HI> who cho&s;e this new plantation as the mo&s;t convenient &s;pot in the world for a charity &s;chool, where <HI>Orphans</HI> might receive the be&s;t education, and be fitted to be the pillars of church and State.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the &s;ums which Bull &s;o freely lavi&s;hed out of his bags for the &s;upport of the vine and mulberry plant|ations; and notwith&s;tanding the collections which Squintum made among his numer|ous
<PB N="97" REF="030051_0096_0FE41671E5589F88">
devotees, the&s;e projects were either &s;o impracticable in them&s;elves, or &s;o ill con|ducted in the execution, that neither of them an&s;wered the expectations of the pro|jectors. For want of black cattle, the &s;oil could not be properly tilled; and for want of grog, the labourers fainted at their work; the right of inheritance being limited to the male line, women and girls were not fond of living there, and the men could not well live without them; land, cattle, women and grog, were to be had el&s;ewhere, and who would be confined to &s;uch a place? The land, too, was claimed by Lord Strut, who &s;ent them writs of ejectment. As to the charity &s;chool, it was on trial found that the co&s;t was more than the profit, and the building, which had &s;wallowed up thou|&s;ands of charity money, was finally con&s;u|med by fire. Poor George Tru&s;ty was di&s;couraged, and begged Mr. Bull to take the plantation into his own hands; how|ever, Bull continued to &s;upply him with ca&s;h, and he kept on making attempts. Alterations were made in the terms of &s;et|tlement,
<PB N="98" REF="030051_0097_0FE41673E03CCAD8">
the re&s;trictions were removed, cat|tle and grog were allowed, Lord Strut was ou&s;ted, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion held; the &s;wamps were drained; rice and indigo were culti|vated in&s;tead of &s;ilk and wine; and upon the whole, con&s;iderable improvements were made, though at &s;uch a va&s;t expen&s;e, that Mr. Bull never &s;aw any adequate returns.</P>
<P>THE ill &s;ucce&s;s of this adventure did not deter him from another project. He was extremely fond of <HI>Trout,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cod fi&s;hery.</NOTE> and thought if he could have them regularly catched and brought to his table, he &s;hould exceed all his neighbours in delicate living; and now and then be able to &s;end a me&s;s to his par|ticular friends. Lord Peter's family, too, he thought, would be glad to buy them, as they were very u&s;eful in the long lents, and frequent meagre days ob&s;erved by them. There was a part of the fore&s;t on the north-ea&s;t quarter, which was very con|veniently &s;ituated for this employment. It had been occupied by ALEXANDER SCOTUS,
<PB N="99" REF="030051_0098_0FE416758D100E20">
a purblind fellow, who had &s;traggled thither no one could tell how; and it was matter of doubt whether he derived his right from Bull, or Lewis; for both of them laid claim to the land, and their claims had not been fairly decided in law. To make &s;ure of the matter, Mr. Bull, by advice of his wife, &s;ent a waggon to bring off the family of Scotus, whom he di&s;tributed among the other families of his tenants; and in their room &s;ent thither<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1749.</NOTE> a parcel of naked, half &s;tarved people, who could live no where el&s;e, and &s;upported them for &s;everal years with provi&s;ions, furni&s;hed them with &s;kiffs, lines, hooks and other implements to carry on the fi&s;hery; but every trout which they catched, co&s;t him ten times as much as if he had bought it in the common market; nor could he, after all, get half of what he wanted for his own con&s;umption. His trout fi&s;hery, and his mulberry plantation, rendered him the laughing &s;tock of his neighbours, nor could he ever gain even the intere&s;t of the money which he had laid
<PB N="100" REF="030051_0099_0FE41678780F1EB8">
out upon them; while the fore&s;ters who had &s;ettled at their own expen&s;e, grew rich and became re&s;pectable. He had indeed the benefit of their trade, which kept his journeymen at work, and obliged him to enlarge their number; for the fore&s;ters had a re&s;pect for their old ma&s;ter and landlord, and when they had any thing to &s;ell, they always let him have the refu&s;al of it, and bought all their goods of him. But though he called him&s;elf their father, and his wife their mother, yet he began to abate of his parental affection for them; and rather looked on them with a jealous eye, as if they were aiming to deprive him of his claim, and &s;et up for independence. Had he been contented with the profits of their trade, as was certainly his intere&s;t, they might have remained his tenants to this day; but ambition, avarice, jealou&s;y and choler, inflamed by bad coun&s;ellors, have wrought &s;uch a &s;eparation, that it is thought Mr. Bull will go mourning all the remainder of his days, and his grey hairs will be brought down with &s;orrow to the grave.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my former letters I have endeav|oured to trace the &s;everal &s;teps by which the fore&s;t became cultivated and peopled. Mr. Bull had no le&s;s than fourteen tenants who held under him, and were &s;ettled on lands which he claimed as his own, and which he had granted to them in &s;eparate parcels. Their names, were as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>Alexander Scotus,</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>IT was ob&s;erved that of all the adventu|rers, tho&s;e generally were the <HI>lea&s;t thriving,</HI> who received <HI>mo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> from their old ma&s;ter. I cannot tell whether it was ow|ing to their being employed in bu&s;ine&s;s to which they had not &s;erved a regular ap|prentice&s;hip, or to a natural indolence, and a di&s;po&s;ition to continue hangers-on where they had got a good hold; for it mu&s;t be noted, that Mr. Bull was very generous to &s;ome per&s;ons, and on &s;ome occa&s;ions where it &s;uited his fancy; and this di&s;po&s;ition in him was &s;o prevalent, that they who ken|ned him, and would humour his whims, could work him out of any thing which they had a mind to.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, tho&s;e adventurers who came into the fore&s;t on their own ac|count, and had no a&s;&s;i&s;tance at all from their old ma&s;ter, nor any thing to help
<PB N="103" REF="030051_0102_0FE4167E1FE07DF0">
them&s;elves with, but their four limbs and five &s;en&s;es, proved to be the mo&s;t indu&s;tri|ous and thriving, and after a while told up a good e&s;tate. They all &s;eemed to have an affection for Mr. Bull, and it was generally believed to be &s;incere. His hou&s;e was u&s;ually &s;poken of by them as their <HI>home.</HI> His ware-hou&s;e was the centre of their traffic; and he had the addre&s;s to engro&s;s the profits of their labour, and draw their earnings into his own fob. To &s;ome of them he would now and then make a pre&s;|ent, to others he would lend a pack of his hounds, when he was out of the humour of hunting; but they were generally u&s;ele&s;s to them for the purpo&s;e of &s;couring the woods; tho&s;e who could afford it, kept dogs of their own, who were better trained to the game, and could better &s;cent the fore&s;t, being native curs, and not &s;o &s;pruce and delicate a breed as Bull's grey-hounds.</P>
<P>IT has been before ob&s;erved, that each end of the fore&s;t was occupied by Bull's rivals. His old neighbour Lewis had got
<PB N="104" REF="030051_0103_0FE41681DE6353D0">
the north end, and Lord Strut the &s;outh. Bull's tenants had &s;eated them&s;elves chief|ly on or near the &s;hore of the lake, and had not extended very far back, becau&s;e of the bea&s;ts of prey; but Lewis, like a cunning old fox, had formed a &s;cheme to get footing in the interior parts of the country, and prevent the&s;e planters from penetrating be|yond the limits which he intended to a&s;&s;ign them. His emi&s;&s;aries had been &s;ent &s;lily into the di&s;tant parts of the fore&s;t, under pretence of taming the&s;e bea&s;ts of prey; but in fact they had halved the matter with them, and had them&s;elves become as &s;avage as the bea&s;ts had become tame. They would run, leap and climb with them, and crawl into their dens, imparting to them a lick of <HI>mola&s;&s;es</HI> out of their calaba&s;h, and teaching them to &s;cratch with their paws the &s;ign of a cro&s;s. They had built &s;everal hunting lodges on the mo&s;t convenient pa&s;&s;|es of the brooks and ponds, and though thus &s;cattered in the wood, were all united un|der one over&s;eer, called ONONTIO, who
<PB N="105" REF="030051_0104_0FE416838C67CBE8">
lived in the man&s;ion-hou&s;e of St. Lewis's Hall.</P>
<P>IT was matter of wonder among Bull's tenants, for &s;ome time, what could be the rea&s;on that the wild bea&s;ts had grown more &s;urly and &s;nappi&s;h of late than formerly; but after a while, &s;ome hunters made a di&s;|covery of the new lodges, which the emi&s;|&s;aries of Onontio had erected, and the de|&s;ign of them being apparent, a general alarm was rai&s;ed in the plantations. On the fir&s;t news, Walter Pipeweed &s;ent his grand&s;on <HI>George,</HI> a &s;mart, active, lively youth, acro&s;s the hills, with his compliments to the in|truders, de&s;iring them to move off, and threatening them with a writ, in ca&s;e of non-compliance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1753.</NOTE> This mode&s;t warning being ineffectual, it was thought that if an <HI>Union</HI> could be formed among the tenants, they might make a &s;tand again&s;t the&s;e en|croachments. A meeting was held at <HI>Or|ange Hall,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Albany, 1754.</NOTE> but no efficient plan could be hit on, without a previous application to
<PB N="106" REF="030051_0105_0FE416858488CFF8">
their landlord, who hearing of this meeting, conceived a jealou&s;y with regard to this <HI>union</HI> which &s;eemed to be their object, and thought it was better to retain the manage|ment of the matter in his own hands, and keep them divided among them&s;elves, but united in their dependence on him. He therefore &s;ent them word that "he had a very great affection for them, and would take care of <HI>their</HI> intere&s;t, which was al&s;o <HI>his own</HI>; that he would not &s;uffer Lewis to &s;et his half tamed wild bea&s;ts upon them, nor eject them from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, but that he would immediately take advice of his council, learned in the law, conjuring them by the affection which they profe&s;&s;ed to bear towards him, to be aiding and a&s;|&s;i&s;ting in all ways in their power, towards bringing the controver&s;y to an i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>AT this time, the &s;teward, to whom Mr. Bull entru&s;ted the care of his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ine&s;s, was not a per&s;on of that di&s;cernment and expe|dition which the exigency of affairs requi|red. He had committed divers blunders in

his accounts, and it was &s;u&s;pected that he was a defaulter in more re&s;pects than one. It cannot, therefore, be expected, that in conducting a controver&s;y of this magnitude, he &s;hould exactly hit on the right methods, nor employ the be&s;t council which could be had. The fir&s;t &s;tep taken was to &s;end <HI>Broadoak</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Braddock, 1755.</NOTE> the bailiff, with a writ of intru|&s;ion, which he was ordered to &s;erve <HI>volens nolens,</HI> upon one of the me&s;&s;uages or hunt|ing-&s;eats of Lewis. This bailiff, proceed|ing ra&s;hly and again&s;t the be&s;t advice into the fore&s;t, not a &s;tep of which he was ac|quainted with, found his progre&s;s impeded in a way wholly unexpected. For Onontio had taken care to place a number of his half tamed wild-cats and wolverenes on the boughs of trees, which hung over the path, and as &s;oon as the bailiff came within reach, having fir&s;t wetted their tails with their own urine, they whi&s;ked it into his eyes till they blinded him.

In every action Bull recovered judgment, and got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. When Lord Strut came in to the aid of Lew|is, Bull ca&s;t him al&s;o, and took away his ma|nor of Augu&s;tine, which, with the whole tract of land, where Onontio pre&s;ided, was annexed to his e&s;tate. The agents who had been employed in this arduous &s;ervice, were not only well paid for doing their duty, but, with the &s;teward who employed them, were honoured according to the an|cient

<P>WHENEVER Bull's &s;teward called upon the fore&s;ters for their quotas of aid towards carrying on this heavy law-&s;uit, they always readily afforded it; and &s;ome of them were really almo&s;t exhau&s;ted by the efforts which they made, to do <HI>more</HI> than their &s;hare. The &s;teward was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of their merit, that on due con&s;ultation with Mr. Bull's wife, and her taking him in the right mood, he was prevailed upon to reimbur&s;e the ex|tra expen&s;e to them, and mutual compla|cency reigned between the landlord and tenants all the time this &s;teward remained in office.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Mr. <HI>BULL</HI> gets into Debt, and by the Advice of his new Wife and her gambling Companions, begins a Quarrel with his Tenants.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO trace with preci&s;ion all the cau&s;es, great and &s;mall, which operated to the di&s;memberment of John Bull's e&s;tate, would be no ea&s;y ta&s;k; &s;ome of them per|haps, were <HI>&s;ecret,</HI> but of &s;uch as were open to ob&s;ervation, we &s;hall endeavour to &s;ketch out the principal.</P>
<P>IT is well known that he was of a chol|eric habit, and that tho&s;e who were ac|quainted with his humor and pa&s;&s;ions, could manage and impo&s;e upon him at their plea&s;ure. Had he been let alone to
<PB N="112" REF="030051_0111_0FE4169473320C70">
pur&s;ue his own bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> his plain, natural good &s;en&s;e, and genero&s;ity of mind, would have kept him clear of many diffi|culties; but he had his advi&s;ers, his hang|ers-on, his levee-hunters, his toad-eaters, and &s;ycophants, forever about him, who, like a parcel of blood-&s;uckers, could never have enough to glut their voracity.</P>
<P>WHEN the fore&s;t was fir&s;t occupied by the tenants, Bull had a wife who minded her own dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s, and did not concern her&s;elf with his landed intere&s;t. The lea&s;es and grants were made out in <HI>his</HI> name, and he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the owner or proprietor; but the lady whom he had married after his &s;econd &s;ickne&s;s, was very a&s;&s;uming, and in&s;i&s;ted on having <HI>her</HI> hand in the management of <HI>all</HI> his affairs. She vi&s;ited the compting-hou&s;e, and made the clerks &s;hew her their books; &s;he overhauled the &s;teward's accounts, and in&s;pected his corre&s;pondence; &s;he not only looked after the rents and incomes of the fore&s;t, but even intruded into the hou&s;ehold
<PB N="113" REF="030051_0112_0FE416961F939A58">
concerns of the tenants, and affected to call her&s;elf <HI>their mother,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he had taken &s;ome care of one or two of them in their fir&s;t &s;etting out, although mo&s;t of them &s;carcely ever had &s;een her face, or had any acquaintance with her, but by hear&s;ay.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, al&s;o, that this wo|man had engaged Mr. Bull in &s;ome expen|&s;ive law-&s;uits and &s;peculations, which had got him deeply into <HI>debt,</HI> and he was obli|ged to hire money of u&s;urers to carry her &s;chemes into execution. Had &s;he, at the &s;ame time, introduced that frugality and economy into the family, which her duty ought to have prompted her to, this debt might have been kept down; but the &s;warm of harpies which were continually about her, and the cour&s;e of gambling which was carried on under her conni|vance and direction, &s;wallowed up all the profits of the trade, and incomes of the land; while the luxury and di&s;&s;ipation of the family increa&s;ed, in proportion as the
<PB N="114" REF="030051_0113_0FE41698183D46C8">
means of di&s;charging the debt decrea&s;ed. In &s;hort, Mr. Bull was reduced to that humiliating condition, which, by whatever fa&s;hionable name it may now go, was formerly called <HI>petticoat government.</HI></P>
<P>DURING the law-&s;uit with Lewis and Lord Strut,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">War of 1756.</NOTE> concerning the fore&s;t, there had been a great intercour&s;e with the ten|ants. Many of Bull's &s;ervants and retain|ers, who were employed as bailiffs and at|tornies, and their deputies, had been very conver&s;ant with them, and were entertained at their hou&s;es, where they always found whole&s;ome victuals, jolly fire &s;ides, and warm beds. They took much notice of every thing that pa&s;&s;ed, a&s;ked many que&s;|tions, and made many remarks on the good|ne&s;s of the land, the plea&s;ant &s;ituation of the hou&s;es, the clean and thriving condition of the children, who were always ready to wait on them, to clean their boots, hold their &s;tirrups, open and &s;hut the gates for them, and the like little nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervices,
<PB N="115" REF="030051_0114_0FE4169A11E281A8">
as well bred children in the country are wont. The remarks which the&s;e per&s;ons made, when they got home, favored rather of envy, than of gratitude or affection. Some of them would &s;ay: "Tho&s;e fellows live too well in the fore&s;t; they thrive too fa&s;t; the place is too good for them; they ought to know who is their ma&s;ter; they can afford to pay more rent; they ought to pay for the help they have had; if it had not been for Ma&s;ter Bull, and the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance which he has lent them, they would have been turned out of doors; and now they are to reap the benefit of his exertions, while he, poor man, is to pay the co&s;t."</P>
<P>THERE were not wanting &s;ome, in the families of the Fore&s;ters them&s;elves, who had the meanne&s;s to crouch to the&s;e fel|lows, and &s;upplicate their favour and inte|re&s;t with Mr. Bull, to recommend them to &s;ome po&s;ts of profit, as under-&s;tewards, col|lectors of rent, clerks of receipts, and the like petty offices. The&s;e beggarly curs would repeat the &s;ame language, and hold
<PB N="116" REF="030051_0115_0FE4169E02C2D538">
corre&s;pondence with the bailiffs, attornies, &amp;c. after they had got home. Whenever any trifling quarrel happened in the families of the tenants, they would magnify it, and fill their letters with complaints of the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the people, and plead for a tighter hand to be held over them.</P>
<P>SUGH &s;peeches as the&s;e were frequently made, and &s;uch letters read, in the hearing of Mr. Bull's wife and &s;teward. Their language grew by degrees to be the current language of the family, and Bull him&s;elf li&s;tened to it. His choler ro&s;e upon the occa&s;ion, and when his hangers-on ob&s;erved it, they plied him with &s;tronger do&s;es, till his jealou&s;y and hatred were excited, and a complete revolution in his temper, with regard to his tenants, took place, agreeably to the mo&s;t &s;anguine and malevolent wi&s;hes of his and their enemies.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t effect of this change was, that his clerks were ordered to charge not only the prices of the goods, which the tenants
<PB N="117" REF="030051_0116_0FE4169FABACEC68">
&s;hould purcha&s;e, but to make them pay for the <HI>paper</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stamp act, 1765.</NOTE> on which their bills of parcels and notes of hand were written, and that at a very exorbitant rate. This was &s;o in|tolerable an abu&s;e, and withal &s;o mean, pit|iful and beggarly an expedient to pick their pockets, that they held a meeting among them&s;elves, and re&s;olved not to buy any more of his goods, as long as this impo&s;i|tion la&s;ted; and by way of contempt, they hanged and burned the effigies of the &s;tew|ard, and other per&s;ons who were &s;u&s;pected of having advi&s;ed to the&s;e new mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>THE re&s;entment &s;hewn by the tenants on this occa&s;ion was quite unexpected. The &s;ecret favourers, and real authors of the mi&s;chief, began to be afraid that they had gone too far for the fir&s;t attempt. Bull's journeymen were in an uproar about it, le&s;t, by the failure of his trade, they &s;hould be out of bread; and to &s;horten the &s;tory, he was obliged to give up the point of making them pay for the paper; though
<PB N="118" REF="030051_0117_0FE416A1A6093E60">
<HI>Madam</HI> had the &s;ingular mode&s;ty to make a declaration, that it was a mere matter of <HI>expediency,</HI> and that &s;he had power and right "to bind them in all ca&s;es what&s;oever," notwith&s;tanding Mr. Bull's <HI>mo&s;t gracious</HI> conce&s;&s;ion at that time.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Repeal of the &s;tamp act, and declaratory act, 1766.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS was con&s;idered by the tenants as a mo&s;t impudent and barefaced a&s;&s;umption; for whatever rights Mr. Bull might pretend to have as their old ma&s;ter and landlord, yet they never had any idea of a <HI>mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> over them; and though they very com|plai&s;antly returned him their thanks for his pre&s;ent goodne&s;s, yet as they &s;u&s;pected that there was more mi&s;chief hatching, they began to inquire more narrowly than ever into his right and title to the land on which they lived. They looked over old parchments and memorandums, con&s;ulted council learned in the law, and after due deliberation, they were fully convinced, that <HI>their own</HI> title was at lea&s;t as good as <HI>his,</HI> and that they had a right to refu&s;e him any
<PB N="119" REF="030051_0118_0FE416A3525972E0">
rent or acknowledgment, if it were prudent for them to exerci&s;e it.</P>
<P>MR. Bull's jealou&s;y was now increa&s;ed with regard to their intentions, and his &s;cribbling retainers frequently accu&s;ed them of ingratitude and di&s;obedience, and a long premeditated de&s;ign to &s;et up for <HI>independ|ence;</HI> a thing which they had not yet thought of, and probably never would, if this abu&s;ive treatment had not put it into their heads.</P>
<P>BUT though by tho&s;e means they were led into an inquiry, and a train of thinking, which were quite new to them; yet as old habits are not ea&s;ily broken, and their affec|tion for their ma&s;ter was very &s;trong, they endeavoured, with a candour which did them honour, to tran&s;fer the blame from him to his wife and &s;teward, to who&s;e machina|tions they knew he was a dupe. The&s;e bad coun&s;ellors &s;oon renewed their attempts in another &s;hape, by rai&s;ing the rent, and put|ting an advanced price upon the goods; and
<PB N="120" REF="030051_0119_0FE416A7818CDDA8">
by means of additional clerks, packers, por|ters, watchmen, draymen, &amp;c. who were continually in waiting, and to all of whom fees were to be paid, the trade laboured under great embarra&s;&s;ments, and &s;ome of the fore&s;ters were quite di&s;couraged, others were vexed and impatient, while &s;ome of the better tempered of them, endeavoured to per&s;uade the re&s;t to keep up the commu|nication as long as they could. They were loth to quarrel with their old ma&s;ter, and yet could not pocket the affronts and abu&s;es to which they were daily expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>DURING this &s;ullen interval, many letters pa&s;&s;ed, many books and precedents were examined, and much ink was &s;hed, in a controver&s;y, which, however incapable of a <HI>deci&s;ion</HI> in this way, might have been <HI>com|promi&s;ed,</HI> if Mr. Bull's fir&s;t thoughts had been as good as his &s;econd; but he was &s;o completely under management, as not to &s;ee his true intere&s;t. It was a common &s;aying among his neighbours, "John Bull's wit comes afterward;" and in fact it did
<PB N="121" REF="030051_0120_0FE416A93297EB68">
not come, in this ca&s;e, till too late, for when a cau&s;e once gets into the law, there are &s;o many quirks, eva&s;ions, demurs, and procra&s;tinations, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to make a retreat, till one or both of the parties have &s;everely &s;marted for their temerity.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SUPPOSE you are by this time impatient for the &s;tory of the law-&s;uit; how it began, and how it was carried on and ended. I will give it to you as briefly as &s;o long and intricate a matter will bear to be told; and I am apprehen&s;ive you will think that Mr. Bull was &s;o ill a politician, or &s;o badly advi&s;ed, as actually to pick a quarrel with his be&s;t cu&s;tomers. But facts will &s;peak for them&s;elves. Know then, that by the advice of his dear wife, and
<PB N="123" REF="030051_0122_0FE416AD273B7CD0">
her gambling junto, Mr. Bull was prevailed upon to &s;end a dozen pounds of tea to each of his tenants, <HI>as a pre&s;ent,</HI> in token of his extreme good will to them, and becau&s;e he knew that they loved it; and at the &s;ame time to order his clerks to charge <HI>three pence</HI> for the paper and pack-thread in which each pound of this exhilerating weed was wrapped. This trifling &s;um he expected would be paid on demand, in ac|knowledgment of their good will to him as their kind and generous landlord, who had protected and defended them again&s;t all oppo&s;ers, and would &s;till continue to pro|tect and defend them as his beloved chil|dren, and obedient humble &s;ervants.</P>
<P>THE knowledge of his intention hap|pened to come to them &s;ooner than the pre&s;ent, and they began to argue thus among them&s;elves&mdash;"Ha! how comes this? What is freer than a gift? If Mr. Bull really intends the tea as a pre&s;ent, why does he exact three pence? Had he offered it to us as an article of merchandi&s;e,
<PB N="124" REF="030051_0123_0FE416B10C038FC0">
as u&s;ual, we might have taken it if we had liked the price, or left it if we had not; but this is a new way of trading to which we have not been accu&s;tomed. There is a de&s;ign in this. If we receive this pre&s;ent and pay the trifling acknowledgment of three pence, by and by we &s;hall have a pre&s;|ent with &s;ix pence annexed, and another with a &s;hilling, and &s;o on. If we once e&s;tabli&s;h a precedent, there is no knowing where to &s;top, and by the&s;e pre&s;ents we may be gulled out of all our loo&s;e corns, and afterwards our real e&s;tates may be de|manded! No, it is better to prevent an evil than to cure it. We will have none of your pre&s;ents, Mr. Bull, if this is to be the con&s;equence. We have paid our debts well&mdash;you have had the <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> benefit of our trade, and have become rich by it, and now in your old age you are grown trick|i&s;h. It is time for us to be on our guard and keep a &s;harp look out; for if a man does not take care of him&s;elf, who can he expect will take care of him?" Fortified with the&s;e arguments, they waited for the
<PB N="125" REF="030051_0124_0FE416B2B3D954A8">
approach of the me&s;&s;engers, who were on the road with the pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>ONE of them came to Charles Indigo's hou&s;e, and with Mr. Bull's compliments begged his acceptance of a package of tea. "Throw it into that cellar, &s;aid Charles, and let it lie there till I have con&s;idered of the matter."</P>
<P>ANOTHER came to William Broadbrim &mdash;but as the way to William's man&s;ion was through a long, crooked, miry lane, he had ordered the porter to &s;top him, and give him liberty to return without deliver|ing his me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>PETER BULLFROG did the &s;ame; but &s;ome part of the tea being &s;muggled into the hou&s;e, as &s;oon as Peter knew it, he threw it into the gutter.</P>
<P>JOHN CODLINE had the greate&s;t difficulty about Mr. Bull's pre&s;ent. He would glad|ly have &s;ent back the me&s;&s;enger, but un|luckily
<PB N="126" REF="030051_0125_0FE416B4AB6FF6F0">
for him, the gate which led to his hou&s;e was held fa&s;t by Bull's <HI>Under Stew|ard,</HI> who con&s;tantly watched and attended there, to ob&s;erve who went in and out, which &s;ervice he was more particularly fond of, becau&s;e he expected a douceur for open|ing and &s;hutting the gate. Having admit|ted the me&s;&s;enger and received his <HI>penny,</HI> he &s;tiffly refu&s;ed to let him out again without having delivered the pre&s;ent. The <HI>fee</HI> was tendered, but this could not prevail; the family were unea&s;y, they were loth to af|front Mr. Bull, and yet determined not to receive his pre&s;ent. They could not ac|count for the conduct of the under &s;teward on any other principle than this, that he ex|pected to get a &s;hare of the <HI>three pence,</HI> and of all other profits ari&s;ing from future pre&s;|ents; and was afraid he &s;hould lo&s;e it if he let the me&s;&s;enger return. The family was called together in the chapel, where they held a long con&s;ultation, &s;ent &s;everal me&s;&s;a|ges to the under &s;teward, who held fa&s;t the gate, and finally refu&s;ed to open it. They were driven at length to an extremity, and
<PB N="127" REF="030051_0126_0FE416B6A1FF8590">
threw the tea into the vault, where it peri&s;h|ed, at the &s;ame time prote&s;ting that the whole blame ought to be charged on the under &s;teward, as they had no intention of injuring Mr. Bull if they could have avoid|ed it.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as this was known in Mr. Bull's family, his wife fell into a violent hy&s;teric fit, and in her raving phrenzy denounced all the vengeance which it was in her pow|er to execute, on the&s;e refractory, ungrate|ful tenants, who would not accept a pre&s;|ent when it was &s;o freely offered to them. But when &s;he came a little to her&s;elf, &s;he was per&s;uaded by her gambling companions not to attempt any thing again&s;t the whole body of the tenants, le&s;t they &s;hould be driven by nece&s;&s;ity to form an union a|mong them&s;elves, which might defeat the plan; &s;he therefore <HI>propo&s;ed</HI> to Mr. Bull to &s;ingle out <HI>one</HI> of the mo&s;t refractory of them, and &s;hew his re&s;entment in a partic|ular manner to <HI>him,</HI> hoping that the others would be intimidated and let him &s;uffer
<PB N="128" REF="030051_0127_0FE416BAA9FD4098">
alone, and be glad to get off &s;o well them|&s;elves. The per&s;on &s;ingled out for the ob|ject of re&s;entment was John Codline, and the mode of re&s;entment was as ridiculous as it was malicious, for it was nothing more nor le&s;s than to &s;end a bailiff, with a pack of blood-hounds, to &s;tand before the great gate that led to the <HI>front</HI> of his hou&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bo&s;ton Port Act, 1774.</NOTE> This, it was thought, would &s;trengthen the authority of the under &s;teward who had the key of the gate, and would reduce the fam|ily to this dilemma, either to receive no company and carry on no bu&s;ine&s;s, or el&s;e to &s;ubmit to Mr. Bull's new mode of trading.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for this particular mode of revenge was, that Mr. Bull, as lord of the manor, claimed a kind of &s;ove|reign right to the high way. He had for a long time exacted an acknowledgment from all pa&s;&s;engers; whenever they hap|pened to meet any of his hor&s;es or carriages on the road, whether he was there him&s;elf or not, they were obliged to <HI>dou&s;e</HI> the hat,
<PB N="129" REF="030051_0128_0FE4174835B16C20">
or they might be &s;ure of receiving a &s;troke of the whip, if not of being run down by his &s;ervants, who had &s;pecial orders not to let any omi&s;&s;ion of this nature pa&s;s unpun|i&s;hed.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this manoeuvre on the part of Mr. Bull, every per&s;on who had any bu&s;ine&s;s to do with John Codline was &s;topped in the road, and ordered to go back, or pa&s;s by, like the Prie&s;t and Levite, on the other &s;ide. However, tho&s;e who had a mind to &s;ee him, found means to climb over the fence, or to go up a narrow lane, which, by the help of a &s;tile and a foot path, led them to Codline's back door.</P>
<P>THIS &s;pecies of puni&s;hment expo&s;ed Mr. Bull to the ridicule of all his neighbours. It al&s;o proved quite ineffectual to the pur|po&s;e for which he de&s;igned it. In&s;tead of hindering company from coming to Cod|line's hou&s;e, it brought more; and he re|ceived many letters from tho&s;e who could not come in per&s;on. But, what was of
<PB N="130" REF="030051_0129_0FE416BC5501EA18">
more &s;ervice to him than letters or vi&s;its was this, that many who were indebted to him came and made payment, and tho&s;e who had at various times received favours from him when they were in di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ent him pre&s;ents, and encouraged him to keep up a good heart, promi&s;ing to &s;tand by him to the la&s;t extremity, if he &s;hould be redu|ced to it.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved, that one advantage which Mrs. Bull expected would ari&s;e from this &s;pecimen of her <HI>refined</HI> policy was, that it would di&s;unite the tenants, and frighten &s;ome or perhaps all the others into a com|pliance with the new mode of traffic. This expectation was grounded on one of the fables of E&s;op, which relates, that a fox who had been caught in a trap, and di&s;en|gaged him&s;elf by the lo&s;s of his tail, when|ever he appeared among the foxes, was the object of their ridicule; upon which, he endeavoured to per&s;uade them that he had been travelling to learn fa&s;hions, and that the newe&s;t fa&s;hion was for foxes to cut off
<PB N="131" REF="030051_0130_0FE416BE4C9D7E00">
their tails as a u&s;ele&s;s and burden&s;ome ap|pendage, and boa&s;ted how much more light and nimble he had become &s;ince he had parted with that incumbrance; to which an old fox replied, that if he would do ju&s;|tice to his argument, he ought to produce the <HI>&s;hears</HI> with which he had cut off his tail, for the conviction of his brethren.</P>
<P>THIS fable, and the moral couched un|der it, rai&s;ed a great deal of vain expecta|tion and triumph in the family of Mr. Bull; but the fore&s;ters had another of their own making, which was a match for it. A man meeting a &s;erpent in the field, &s;truck at him with a &s;tick, and there being but one in his view he thought to kill him immediately; but the &s;nake &s;et up &s;uch a hi&s;s as brought a dozen more out of their holes, who attack|ed the proud murderer in front, rear, and flank, and obliged him to take to his heels for &s;afety. This fable was &s;o much admired among the fore&s;ters at that time, that they had an engraving made on all their me&s;&s;age cards, of a wounded &s;erpent, with this motto, <HI>Join or die.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Quarrel begins in earne&s;t and is carried into the Law.&mdash;Conduct of the Managers on both Sides.&mdash;The fir&s;t Verdict in favour of the Fore&s;ters given at Saratoga Hall.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE in&s;ult which the fore&s;ters &s;up|po&s;ed to be put on them by the ob&s;truction of the road, as mentioned in my la&s;t, cau&s;|ed a &s;erious alarm, and induced them to call a meeting of the heads of the &s;everal families to con&s;ult for their own &s;afety. The re&s;ult of this meeting was to endeav|our, by all peaceable means in their power, to effect an accommodation; but if that &s;hould fail, to prepare, in the be&s;t manner they could, to a&s;&s;ert and maintain their rights, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and properties.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="030051_0132_0FE416C436042BB8">IN pro&s;ecution of the former part of their plan, they wrote letters to Mr. Bull, and to &s;everal members of his family; and with re&s;pect to the latter part, they came to a re&s;olution to buy nothing more of him till he &s;hould change his mode of conduct, and treat them as he had formerly done.</P>
<P>IN the letters which they wrote on this occa&s;ion, though they profe&s;&s;ed a great deal of re&s;pect and affection for the old gentleman him&s;elf; they <HI>omitted</HI> to &s;end their compliments to his wife. This was more than Madam could bear. She there|fore, after con&s;ulting with her gambling companions, determined upon the two fol|lowing points; fir&s;t, that no an&s;wer at all &s;hould be given to the letter; and &s;econdly, that an action at law &s;hould be entered, and the tenants ejected from their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions. She would not however have come to this latter determination, if &s;he had not been a&s;&s;ured by per&s;ons who pretended thoroughly to under&s;tand their family &s;e|crets, that the fore&s;ters <HI>would not dare to
<PB N="134" REF="030051_0133_0FE416C5E5242208">
defend their title in law</HI>; but on the fir&s;t appearance of a legal proce&s;s, would &s;ub|mit to any terms of accommodation which her lady&s;hip might think proper to impo&s;e. Full of this idea, &s;he roundly &s;wore that &s;he would &s;ee them <HI>pro&s;trate at her feet,</HI> be|fore &s;he would make up the matter with them on any terms whatever.</P>
<P>INFLUENCED by her pa&s;&s;ions, Mr. Bull's choler ro&s;e to the highe&s;t pitch. As lord of the manor, he placed bailiffs and blood|hounds in the high way, and denied all pa&s;&s;age to any per&s;ons without his licen&s;e. He then called upon all the coun&s;ellors and attornies to whom he had given a re|taining fee, and who were very numerous, to exert all their learning and eloquence in maintaining his cau&s;e, promi&s;ing them not only a regular payment of their fees, but a generous allowance for di&s;bur&s;ements and incidental charges, to be paid at &s;ight by a draught on his banker; and when the cau&s;e &s;hould be gained, that each one
<PB N="135" REF="030051_0134_0FE416C7E04C0D18">
&s;hould be entitled to a plantation in the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>THESE &s;agacious gentlemen, (many of whom were of Madam's own junto) find|ing that they had a fat client, contrived to <HI>hu&s;band the job,</HI> and &s;pin out the cau&s;e <HI>&s;ecundum artem.</HI> They were old profi|cients in the &s;cience, and knew very well how to take double receipts of their &s;ta|tioners, bailiffs, me&s;&s;engers, and other re|tainers, <HI>i. e.</HI> one receipt for the exact &s;um paid, and another for <HI>double</HI> the &s;ame &s;um; the&s;e latter were always produced as vouch|ers in the &s;ettlement of accounts, and in the glorious uncertainty of the law were admitted under the name of <HI>duplicates.</HI> It would divert you to &s;ee the numberle&s;s <HI>items</HI> which they crowded into their bills of co&s;t, and the various pleas and pre|tences which were formed for demurring and continuing the cau&s;e from one &s;e&s;&s;ion to another; while they were feeding their client with the hope that in every <HI>next</HI> &s;e&s;&s;ion it would be decided.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="030051_0135_0FE416C98CC83B68">ON the other hand, the fore&s;ters finding that Mr. Bull had retained &s;o many learned coun&s;ellors, &s;erjeants and barri&s;ters in his &s;ervice, and that he had by far the longe&s;t pur&s;e, were obliged to u&s;e the greate&s;t economy in conducting their defence. On looking round to &s;ee who was the mo&s;t prudent, the mo&s;t deliberate, and the mo&s;t determined among them, and to whom they might with &s;afety commit their cau&s;e, they unanimou&s;ly pitched upon <HI>Walter Pipeweed</HI>'s grand&s;on <HI>George</HI>; who, being elected their chief attorney, mode&s;tly ac|cepted the office on this generous condition, that they &s;hould not in&s;i&s;t on his receiving any fee or reward, becau&s;e he conceived that in &s;erving them he was doing no more than his duty. This in&s;tance of magna|nimity was interpreted by them as a &s;ure omen of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>GEORGE was a man of good under&s;tand|ing and true &s;punk; he had made con&s;id|erable progre&s;s in the &s;tudy of the law for his own amu&s;ement, and had practi&s;ed at
<PB N="137" REF="030051_0136_0FE416CD8B50E190">
the bar in the defence of his own family claims again&s;t the encroachments of Lewis. His abilities were of &s;uch a nature as to ri&s;e and &s;hine with the opportunities which called them into action. This was al&s;o the ca&s;e with divers other per&s;ons in the families of the fore&s;ters; who would, per|haps, never have thought of engaging in the &s;tudy of the law, had not this contro|ver&s;y been agitated; but would have re|mained in the &s;tate which is thus elegantly de&s;cribed by the poet.</P>

<L>Full many a flower is born to blu&s;h un&s;een,</L>
<L>And wa&s;te its &s;weetne&s;s on the de&s;art air."</L>
<P>THIS circum&s;tance was predicted in the hearing of Mr. Bull's wife, by a very learn|ed and hone&s;t gentleman, who would have di&s;&s;uaded her from giving her hu&s;band &s;uch bad advice as to plunge him&s;elf into that deep ditch, the law, out of which there is no coming till the la&s;t farthing be paid.

match, in point of numbers at lea&s;t, for the whole ho&s;t of Mr. Bull's attornies.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t action was brought again&s;t John Codline, who was deemed the mo&s;t &s;urly and refractory of the whole number. It was thought if he could be ca&s;t, the others would of cour&s;e &s;ubmit. In this way of proceeding, Mr. Bull acted like that &s;pecies of dog which bears his name, and which is known to attack his enemy by the head.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;e was learnedly argued at the Court of <HI>Bunker hall,</HI> and the arguments in favour of the fore&s;ters made a very un|expected
<PB N="140" REF="030051_0139_0FE416D32075DC38">
and very deep impre&s;&s;ion on the managers for Mr. Bull. They found it a much more &s;erious affair than they had imagined, and thought it be&s;t to &s;top &s;hort and have the ca&s;e <HI>hung up,</HI> that they might con&s;ult their books over again, and pre|pare them&s;elves by better authorities and allegations at the next hearing. After a long time they contrived to <HI>&s;hift their ground,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">March, 1776.</NOTE> and let John alone. They advi&s;ed Mr. Bull to &s;end for &s;ome lawyers out of Germany, who had been more u&s;ed to this kind of pleading, and to lay an attachment on the e&s;tate of Peter Bullfrog&punc; and the farm called Cae&s;area; where they expected to gain &s;ome greater advantage, partly becau&s;e the tenancy was different, being founded on courte&s;y and not on lea&s;e, and partly becau&s;e of the di&s;&s;entions which they heard were &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the&s;e families. In this interval al&s;o Madam Bull's re&s;entment was rai&s;ed &s;o high, that &s;he &s;wore point blank that not one of the&s;e refractory &s;coun|drels &s;hould enter her hu&s;band's doors, nor
<PB N="141" REF="030051_0140_0FE416D70D211198">
have the lea&s;t connexion with him, but that &s;he would drive them off from the land, and re-people the fore&s;t with another &s;et of men.</P>
<P>WHEN they had heard of this re&s;olution, the heads of all the families in one of their con&s;ultations, came to a determination to publi&s;h an adverti&s;ement, &s;etting forth the various abu&s;es and grievances which they had &s;uffered from Mr. Bull, his wife, and her junto; and declaring that they looked upon the country as <HI>their own,</HI> and them|&s;elves free from any obligations to him, and at liberty to look out for other markets, and invite other merchants to form connex|ions with them. This tran&s;action was &s;o important an era in the controver&s;y, that the <HI>fourth of July,</HI> the day on which the adverti&s;ement was dated, has ever &s;ince been celebrated as a day of fe&s;tivity. The morning of that anniver&s;ary is u&s;hered in with a firing of guns and fluttering of pi|geons. At noon you may hear &s;ome young lad &s;pouting a declamation in favour of free
<PB N="142" REF="030051_0141_0FE416D8B5CC6A48">
trade; which is generally followed by a bowl of punch and a rump of beef, and the day is concluded with a &s;ong and a dance.</P>
<P>IN the progre&s;s of the action, &s;everal points of law were argued at different times with much &s;kill and learning. On one of the&s;e occa&s;ions George was reduced to a dilemma, and his opponents thought him ab&s;olutely &s;ilenced; but &s;uddenly rec|ollecting him&s;elf, he ro&s;e &s;uperior to them,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trenton, 1776.</NOTE> and compelled them again to move for a continuance. Thus the cau&s;e was kept &s;u&s;pended till the <HI>third year</HI> was almo&s;t clo&s;ed. At length a vaunting braggadocio of a barri&s;ter on Mr. Bull's &s;ide, who thought to carry all before him, was &s;o completely an&s;wered and confuted in an ob&s;tinate argument, that a verdict was giv|en at <HI>Saratoga hall</HI> in favour of tho&s;e plan|tations, which had been &s;ued for in the northern part of the manor. This verdict relieved the fore&s;ters in &s;ome degree, and it
<PB N="143" REF="030051_0142_0FE416DAAC679590">
was hoped would prove a good precedent for the deci&s;ion of the other &s;uits which were meditating again&s;t their brethren in the &s;outhern part.</P>
<P>THE unfortunate barri&s;ter was &s;everely reflected on by Mr. Bull's wife, for not do|ing his duty; and he was obliged to ju&s;|tify him&s;elf by producing his in&s;tructions, and by telling a number of &s;erious truths re&s;pecting the fore&s;t and the fore&s;ters, which Mrs. Bull had often heard before but would not believe. The relation of the&s;e truths was &s;o very offen&s;ive that &s;he influ|enced her hu&s;band never more to employ him; and as he could get no other bu&s;i|ne&s;s in the law, he afterward employed him&s;elf in writing plays and romances, in which he was more &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU may well &s;uppo&s;e that a three years law-&s;uit was a very expen&s;ive undertaking on both &s;ides; and you will wonder how the fore&s;ters, circum&s;tanced as they were, could &s;truggle with &s;uch an antagoni&s;t; e&s;pecially when the high way was &s;o ob&s;tructed that they could not car|ry their provi&s;ions to market to procure them ca&s;h. The truth is, that though they were
<PB N="145" REF="030051_0144_0FE416E0D25CAB18">
&s;erved <HI>gratis</HI> by their prime coun&s;ellor, yet they were obliged to give promi&s;&s;ory notes to the attornies, &s;criveners, bailiffs, and me&s;|&s;engers, whom they employed under him; but as the pro&s;pect of payment was di&s;tant, the notes pa&s;&s;ed at a di&s;count, and the only remedy in their power was to i&s;&s;ue <HI>more,</HI> which in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening increa&s;ed the dif|ficulty.</P>
<P>THEY had early fore&s;een this difficulty, and applied privately to Mr. Lewis, Mr. Frog, and Lord Strut, to borrow money on intere&s;t. The&s;e old curmudgeons, though each of them looked with an envi|ous eye on Mr. Bull, and &s;ecretly wi&s;hed he might lo&s;e the cau&s;e, yet were induced by various con&s;iderations to evade the que&s;|tion propo&s;ed to them by the fore&s;ters. "We mu&s;t, &s;aid they, keep up appearances with our old neighbour; we have accounts open with him, as well as claims upon &s;ome portions of land, to which our title is no better than his; we may draw our&s;elves in|to a &s;crape, and &s;et our own tenants a bad

example, for who knows but the &s;ame ar|guments may avail with them to refu&s;e their rents to us? Be&s;ides, how do we know whether the&s;e fellows will ever be able to pay? They offer to mortgage the manor to us, but the title is yet in di&s;pute, and how do we know whether it be their's or Mr. Bull's?" The&s;e were the &s;ecret rea&s;ons which induced them to evade a di|rect an&s;wer to the me&s;&s;engers; and, like true courtiers, "To &s;queeze their hands, and beg them come to|morrow."</P>
<P>BUT as &s;oon as the verdict was given at <HI>Saratoga hall,</HI> they began to change their mind, and wi&s;hed not only to make them debtors, but even to enter into contracts to a large amount.</P>
<P>MR. Lewis was the fir&s;t to make advan|ces, and meeting the me&s;&s;engers one day on 'change, he acco&s;ted them thus: "Your &s;ervant, gentlemen&mdash;I congratulate you on your &s;ucce&s;s; you are welcome to my hou&s;e,
<PB N="147" REF="030051_0146_0FE416E4759FE3D8">
and ware-hou&s;e, and table. I will lend you a few livres to help you to fini&s;h the con|trover&s;y; and if Mr. Frog will advance a few &s;tivers, I will give him my bond for &s;e|curity. Be&s;ides, I will con&s;ent that my own coun&s;ellors, barri&s;ters, and attornies, whom I have retained, &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t you at the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, and I will &s;ee if I cannot open the high way, that you may bring your pro|duce to market. When you &s;ee Lord Strut, give my compliments to him, and tell him what I have promi&s;ed, and I dare &s;ay he will, out of friend&s;hip to <HI>me,</HI> and for the &s;ake of our old <HI>family compact,</HI> give you &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for look ye, gentlemen, I will be hone&s;t with you, I mean to promote <HI>my own</HI> intere&s;t by &s;erving you, and I am &s;ure he has the &s;ame meaning.</P>
<P>THIS change in the &s;entiments and lan|guage of Mr. Lewis, was immediately made known to Mr. Bull, by means of &s;ome run|ning footmen, who frequently carried news from one hou&s;e to the other. Con&s;ternation &s;eized the whole family, and Mrs. Bull her|&s;elf

<P>AS &s;oon as this conference was ended, &s;he wrote a billet in a very complai&s;ant &s;tyle, but in a hand &s;carcely legible,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1778.</NOTE> and was in &s;uch a hurry to &s;end it, that &s;he could not wait for one of the clerks to copy it, pre|&s;enting Mr. and Mrs. Bull's compliments to the gentlemen tenants, informing them that it was not intended to trouble them any farther for the payment of paper and pack-thread, which had been the occa&s;ion of the controver&s;y; but to &s;ettle all mat|ters by a reference, and that &s;uitable per|&s;ons &s;hould &s;oon be deputed to confer with them, or any of them on the premi&s;es. This billet was hurried away by an expre&s;s, and actually arrived before the fore&s;ters had heard of Mr. Lewis's intended kindne&s;s to them. But they received it with con|tempt,
<PB N="151" REF="030051_0150_0FE416EDD7CEDD28">
and gave no other an&s;wer to it than this, "Let Mr. Bull withdraw his action and clear the road, and we will talk with <HI>him;</HI> but as to <HI>his wife,</HI> we will have noth|ing to do with <HI>her.</HI>"</P>
<P>AFTER they had given this an&s;wer, word was brought them of the good will of Mr. Lewis, which was received with the great|e&s;t joy imaginable. He was accounted the fine&s;t gentleman in the whole country, and all the &s;tories which they had heard of him, through the medium of Bull's family, were &s;et down as lies. He was regarded as the protector of the injured, the helper of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and the friend of the rights of mankind.</P>
<P>WHILE the prai&s;es of Lewis were thus echoed from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, the deputies of Madam Bull arrived. They were in|&s;tructed by her lady&s;hip to enter into free conver&s;ation with the fore&s;ters, or any of them, publickly or privately; to tell them that they were greatly deceived if they took
<PB N="152" REF="030051_0151_0FE416EF85CF4A18">
Mr. Lewis for their friend; that he was an arch, &s;ly, deceitful fellow, and that no tru&s;t ought to be put in him; that Mr. and Mrs. Bull were very amicably di&s;po&s;ed toward them, and willing to forget and forgive all that was pa&s;t, to renew the former intercour&s;e, to take off all the charges and burdens which had been com|plained of; to help them to pay the debt which they had incurred by the law-&s;uit; and as the greate&s;t proof imaginable of Mrs. Bull's particular favour to them, &s;he would admit any of them to vi&s;it her in her own drawing-room, and give them a &s;eat at her card-table. As a token of her &s;incerity in the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, &s;he &s;ent &s;everal pre&s;ents to their wives and daughters, and gave the deputies a large pur&s;e of money, to be di&s;tributed <HI>privately</HI> among the mo&s;t influential per&s;ons in the &s;everal families.</P>
<P>THE deputies had &s;carcely alighted, be|fore they &s;ent their footman to the door of the hou&s;e where the heads of the families were a&s;&s;embled, with a me&s;&s;age of compli|ments
<PB N="153" REF="030051_0152_0FE416F3623FF1C0">
to announce their arrival, and a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion to make a friendly vi&s;it. The porter refu&s;ed entrance to the footman, and he returned, without having delivered his me&s;&s;age. The deputies then wrote the purport of their errand, and &s;ent it to the porter, who delivered it, and the following an&s;wer was returned&mdash;
<LETTER>
<P>"GENTLEMEN, we cannot hear any invectives again&s;t our good friend Mr. Lewis. If your ma&s;ter is in earne&s;t, tell him that he mu&s;t withdraw his action and clear the road. This is all from your humble &s;ervant,</P>

<P>DISAPPOINTED and chagrined, but not wholly di&s;couraged, the deputies attempted privately to get into &s;ome of the hou&s;es; but they were refu&s;ed entrance. They wrote letters and threw them in at the windows, or put them into the key-holes, but all to no purpo&s;e. The firmne&s;s and

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTHING could exceed the rage into which Mrs. Bull was thrown by this di&s;appointment. "O the&s;e cur&s;ed, &s;tub|born, ungrateful, di&s;obedient wretches, to refu&s;e all my invitations, and &s;purn at my offers of friend&s;hip and reconciliation!
<PB N="156" REF="030051_0155_0FE416F739FE5FE0">
What, not admit my deputies into their hou|&s;es! Did ever any woman &s;uffer &s;uch di&s;|grace? Well, faith, I will be revenged, and they &s;hall feel the power of my vengeance. I will pro&s;ecute them, to the utmo&s;t extrem|ity of the law; ay, and beyond law too, for I will &s;et their hou&s;es on fire over their heads, and drive them off the land! And as to that deceitful dog of a Lewis, I will rai&s;e &s;uch a hornet's ne&s;t about his ears, that he &s;hall repent his bargain! If Lord Strut attempts to help him, I'll lay an at|tachment upon his riche&s;t farms. And as for Nic Frog, if he lends them money, I will break up his ware-hou&s;e, and fell all his goods by auction. I will &s;atiate my vengeance on the whole pack of them, and if I fall my&s;elf among the general wreck, I &s;hall have the glory of dying like Sam&s;on in the ruin of my enemies."</P>
<P>THE rage which Mrs. Bull indulged on this occa&s;ion, and the noi&s;e which &s;he made in her raving fits, rai&s;ed a great alarm in the family, and as hy&s;terics are &s;aid to be
<PB N="157" REF="030051_0156_0FE416F9365A1000">
catching, &s;o the di&s;temper &s;pread into the two next families, viz. into tho&s;e of &s;i&s;ter Peg and brother Patrick. The former imagined that it was Mr. Bull's intention to call in Lord Peter to his aid, becau&s;e he had been of late &s;omewhat complai&s;ant to tho&s;e of his natural children, who re&s;ided in the family; and the latter expected that he &s;hould be treated in the &s;ame manner as the fore&s;ters, becau&s;e he had complained of &s;ome re&s;traints and impo&s;itions from his brother John Bull, in re&s;pect to his trade and bu&s;ine&s;s, which was that of a linen-draper. Old jealou&s;ies and grudges were revived on this occa&s;ion, and the whole neighbourhood was in confu&s;ion. The dogs in Peg's family kept a con&s;tant howl|ing and barking, and were an&s;wered by tho&s;e of Mr. Bull. Several of them actu|ally ran mad,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prote&s;tant a&s;&s;ociation, 1779 and 1780.</NOTE> and Bull was obliged to place guards at his doors and gates, who attacked the curs with clubs, and killed &s;ev|eral on the &s;pot. In the mid&s;t of this hurly burly, his hou&s;e was &s;et on fire, and was
<PB N="158" REF="030051_0157_0FE416FCD34891B8">
actually &s;een blazing in thirty-&s;ix places at once;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord G. Gordon's mob.</NOTE> the fire even penetrated Madam's drawing-room, and her card party were obliged to hand buckets and pump the en|gine; and it was not without the greate&s;t exertions that the whole man&s;ion was &s;aved from utter de&s;truction.</P>
<P>A DIFFICULTY al&s;o aro&s;e from another quarter, where it was little expected. The mea&s;ure which Mr. Bull had adopted of &s;topping the high way, and &s;earching all carriages, provoked all the neighbours, who thought it a great infringement of their common rights; but as he was a per&s;on of &s;o much wealth and power, they were afraid openly to conte&s;t that point with him. At length an elderly widow lady, of large property, with whom he had al|ways lived on friendly terms, and who gen|erally went by the name of Madam <HI>Kate,</HI> took the liberty to tell him, that &s;he could no longer &s;uffer her neighbours and her&s;elf to be &s;o impo&s;ed upon; that the high way
<PB N="159" REF="030051_0158_0FE416FE79E41D38">
was common to all; that he had no right to &s;top pa&s;&s;engers and examine them, but that every body ought to go about their lawful bu&s;ine&s;s without let or hindrance, and that &s;he was determined to form a combination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Armed neutrality formed by the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, &amp;c.</NOTE> with Mr. Frog, Mr. Lewis, Lord Strut, and all the other neighbours, to remove the incumbrances which Mr. Bull had thrown in the way, and clear the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>THIS combination extended to other ob|jects, be&s;ides clearing the high way. They were all di&s;po&s;ed to help the fore&s;ters again&s;t Mr. Bull, though in different ways. Lewis had already lent them money and feed law|yers to plead for them. Lord Strut, though rich in landed intere&s;t, yet generally antici|pated his revenues, (or as the vulgar phra&s;e is, ate the calf in the cow's belly) he there|fore had no money to &s;pare; but to oblige his friend Lewis, he laid an attachment on a &s;outherly corner of the fore&s;t, which for+merly
<PB N="160" REF="030051_0159_0FE41700728D0658">
belonged to him, and which from the numerous flowers with which it a|bounds, had got the name of <HI>Terra Florida.</HI> At the &s;ame time he attached one of Mr. Bull's favourite hunting-&s;eats,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gibraltar.</NOTE> which com|manded an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect, and was &s;it|uate extremely convenient for hunting, fowling, and fi&s;hing. It had formerly be|longed to Strut, but he had fooli&s;hly lo&s;t it by &s;taking it in a game of <HI>whil&s;t,</HI> which he played with Mr. Bull. It was a doubt in law whether real e&s;tate could be held by &s;uch tenure, but Bull had <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> and that you know is eleven points of the law. At any rate, it would oblige Bull to defend; and that would co&s;t him money, and divert &s;ome at lea&s;t of his lawyers from the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>A SECRET corre&s;pondence had for &s;ome time been carried on between the fore&s;ters and Mr. Frog, for a loan of ca&s;h, and a mercantile contract. Bull had &s;u&s;pected it, but could not prove it, till one night,
<PB N="161" REF="030051_0160_0FE41702208F9628">
his myrmidons caught a me&s;&s;enger from the fore&s;t and &s;earched his pockets,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capture of Mr. Laurens.</NOTE> in which were found certain letters and other papers, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to full evidence.</P>
<P>UPON this occa&s;ion an adverti&s;ement was publi&s;hed, according to fa&s;hion, ju&s;tifying the mea&s;ures about to be taken, and deplo|ring the evils which were connected with them. However &s;mall a &s;hare of credit the&s;e publications obtain, it is generally as much as they de&s;erve.</P>
<P>TO make &s;hort work with Frog, Mr. Bull got a &s;earch-warrant, and &s;ent a bailiff to his riche&s;t ware-hou&s;e,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">St. Eu&s;tatius.</NOTE> who entered it, <HI>per fas aut nefas,</HI> tumbled over the mer|chandi&s;e, under pretence of &s;earching for &s;tolen goods; and having taken away as many as he plea&s;ed, by a writ of <HI>venditioni exponas,</HI> he put them up at auction, and it is &s;aid, made a fortune by this job. Mr.
<PB N="162" REF="030051_0161_0FE41706594613D8">
Lewis was &s;o exa&s;perated at the outrage thus committed on his friend Frog, that by a writ of <HI>&s;cire facias,</HI> he laid claim to the ware-hou&s;e and its contents, and brought in Bull for damages.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Mr. Bull now found him&s;elf &s;ou&s;ed over head and ears in that deep ditch, the law. Like I&s;hmael of old, his hand was again&s;t every man, and every man's hand again&s;t him. Look which way &s;oever he would, he found enemies, and his own family were continually buzzing in his ears, that he would bring his affairs to ruin.</P>
<P>BY the a&s;&s;i&s;tance derived from the loans which they had negociated with Lewis and Frog, and the additional coun&s;ellors and attornies which Lewis employed for them, the fore&s;ters pur&s;ued the controver&s;y with as much vigour as the forms, delays and uncertainty of the law would permit. No le&s;s than four years longer were con&s;umed in this expen&s;ive quarrel, and Mr. Bull's
<PB N="163" REF="030051_0162_0FE41708062D7778">
numerous retinue of lawyers were employ|ing them&s;elves in the various chicanery and tergiver&s;ations of their profe&s;&s;ion, all the while fattening on the profits of the &s;uit; whil&s;t his debt was growing at &s;uch a rate, that he was at his wit's end to keep the intere&s;t from accumulating as well as the principal. At length, by a capital manoeu|vre of Pipeweed's grand&s;on George, aided by the coun&s;ellors of Lewis, the cau&s;e was brought to a hearing at <HI>York</HI> court, and the arguments were of &s;uch efficacy, that a <HI>&s;econd verdict</HI> was given in favour of the fore&s;ters, with large damages. This ver|dict came &s;o near to a final deci&s;ion, that all Mr. Bull's friends were convinced he could no longer maintain an action again&s;t the fore&s;ters; and &s;ome tru&s;ty old &s;ervants ventured to whi&s;per in Madam's ear that it was high time to end the controver&s;y, for that it could not po&s;&s;ibly be carried any farther, without bringing the family and the trade to total ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="030051_0163_0FE4170A0082C878">"LOOK ye, Madam, (&s;aid they) how all the &s;chemes which you have laid, have been uniformly defeated; you have pro|fe&s;&s;ed to know the family <HI>&s;ecrets</HI> of the&s;e fore&s;ters; but tho&s;e fellows who pretended to give you this information have deceived you. In fact, they have no &s;uch &s;ecrets as your lady&s;hip imagines. What has been <HI>openly</HI> told you all along, is the truth, and you ought long ago to have believed it. Now the conviction has forced it&s;elf upon you, and you can no longer with&s;tand it. The fore&s;ters have been defending their title in the law, and they have made it ap|pear &s;o plainly, that no jury in the world will ever give a verdict again&s;t them.

<P>WHEN Mr. Bull had taken the matter into con&s;ideration, he thought it be&s;t to wait the i&s;&s;ue of the &s;uit with Lord Strut about the hunting-&s;eat, for he was loth to lo&s;e that; and happily for him, when that cau&s;e came to trial, it was argued &s;o forcibly by his lawyers, that Strut was obliged to give it up. As &s;oon as Bull heard of that, he cried out, "Now is the moment of victory &mdash;now is the time for peace." So calling one of his clerks, "Here, &s;ays he, go and &s;ettle the matter with the fore&s;ters, or their deputies, on the be&s;t terms that you can."

This quit-claim being properly engro&s;&s;ed, he with a trembling hand and aching heart &s;ub&s;cribed it, while Madam, &s;tanding behind him, could not help &s;hedding a tear at the &s;ight of a tran&s;action to which &s;he would never have con&s;ented but from dire nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS loth to break the thread of my narration in my former letters, and you know that we prattling folks love to tell our &s;tories in our own way, which we are under great advantage to do when we are writing letters. But I will now go back to tell you &s;omething of the manner in which the fore&s;ters managed their dome&s;tic affairs during the controver&s;y with Mr. Bull, and for &s;ome time after it was clo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="030051_0169_0FE41719A52B55C8">WHEN they had broken their connex|ion with him, it was uncertain what con|nexions they might form abroad, but it was judged expedient for them to be united a|mong them&s;elves, that no one family &s;hould connect it&s;elf in trade with any merchant or factor, without the con&s;ent of the others. In &s;hort, it became nece&s;&s;ary for them to enter into a partner&s;hip for their mutual intere&s;t and convenience. To do this was a nice point, and required much delicacy. It was to them a new &s;ubject, and they had an untrodden path before them. After much con&s;ultation and inquiry, their inge|nuity &s;ugge&s;ted to them the idea of an original &s;ocial compact. "Why &s;hould we (&s;aid they) look abroad for precedents, when we have enough among our&s;elves? See the <HI>beavers</HI> in our own brooks and meadows, how they work in complete partner&s;hip, each family has its own cell, and a number of cells are placed in one pond. They carry on their operations with peace and unanimity, without even the appearance of a <HI>ma&s;ter.</HI> Here is a perfect republic, a
<PB N="171" REF="030051_0170_0FE4171B615274E0">
complete equality, a &s;triking example of order without &s;ubordination, of liberty without jealou&s;y, of indu&s;try without coer|cion, of economy without par&s;imony, of &s;agacity without overbearing influence. Every one knows his own bu&s;ine&s;s and does it, their labour goes on with regular|ity and decency; their united efforts &s;erve the common cau&s;e, and the intere&s;t of every one is involved in that of the whole. Let us go and do likewi&s;e." The hint took, and a plan of CONFEDERATION, as it was called, was drawn up on principles of the pure&s;t equality; each family retaining the entire control of its own dome&s;tic concerns, without any interference of the others, and agreeing to contribute <HI>voluntarily</HI> its pro|portion of labour and money to &s;upport the common intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS was, in theory, a very pretty de|vice, exactly &s;uited to a &s;et of people who thought them&s;elves completely virtuous. But as it often happens that great ingenuity exi&s;ts without much judgment or policy,
<PB N="172" REF="030051_0171_0FE4171D5DB37460">
&s;o it proved here. The&s;e fore&s;ters did not con&s;ider that their intellects were not, like tho&s;e of the beavers, confined to a few par|ticular objects; that they were not, like the beavers, void of pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices, void of ambition, jealou&s;y, avarice and &s;elf-intere&s;t. With all the infirmities of hu|manity, they were expecting to e&s;tabli&s;h a community on a plan &s;imilar to that in which no &s;uch deformities can po&s;&s;ibly find admittance.</P>
<P>THOUGH for a while, and during the period of the law-&s;uit, when common dan|ger impelled them to keep them&s;elves clo&s;e together, this plan an&s;wered the end better than none; yet <HI>in fact</HI> the notion of <HI>inde|pendence</HI> had &s;o intoxicated their minds, that having ca&s;t off their dependence on Mr. Bull, they thought them&s;elves inde|pendent of all the world be&s;ide. When they had got entirely clear of the contro|ver&s;y with him, they were in the condition of a young heir ju&s;t come of age, who feels proud of his freedom, and thinks he

has a right to act without control. Each family felt its own importance, and expect|ed a degree of re&s;pect from the others, in proportion to its numbers, its property, its exertions, its <HI>antiquity,</HI> and other trifling con&s;iderations, which ought never to have had any place in a partner&s;hip of complete equality; and in con&s;equence of this in|toxicating idea of independence, each fam|ily claimed the right of giving or withhold|ing its con&s;ent to what was propo&s;ed by any or all of the others.</P>
<P>IN the club room, among a number of ingenious devices, there was a clock, of a mo&s;t curious and intricate con&s;truction, by which all the common concerns of the part|ner&s;hip were to be regulated. It had <HI>one</HI> bell, on which <HI>thirteen</HI> di&s;tinct hammers &s;truck the hours. Each hammer was moved by independent wheels and weights, each &s;et of wheels and weights was inclo&s;ed in a &s;eparate ca&s;e, the key of which was kept, not as it ought to have been, by the per&s;on who repre&s;ented the family at club, but in
<PB N="174" REF="030051_0173_0FE41722CEB434B8">
each man&s;ion hou&s;e; and every family claimed a right either to keep the key at home or &s;end it to club, when and by whom they plea&s;ed. Now as this clock, like all other automatons, needed frequently to be wound up, to be oiled and cleaned, a very nice and particular adju&s;tment of circum|&s;tances was nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the regu|larity of its motions, and make the ham|mers perform their functions with propri|ety. Sometimes one or two of the ham|mers would be out of order, and when it came to the turn of one to &s;trike it would be &s;ilent; then there mu&s;t be a running or &s;ending home for the key, and the hou&s;es being at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, much time was &s;pent in waiting. Sometimes&punc; the me&s;&s;enger arrived at an un&s;ea&s;onable hour, when the family was a&s;leep, or abroad in the fields, and it would take up a con&s;ider|able time to collect them, and lay the ca&s;e before them, that they might deliberate and determine whether the key &s;hould be &s;ent or not; and before this could be done, the clock would get more out of order.
<PB N="175" REF="030051_0174_0FE417248B4DE008">
By this means, the club was frequently perplexed; they knew neither the hour of the day, nor the day of the month; they could not date their letters, nor adju&s;t their books, nor do bu&s;ine&s;s with any regularity.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, there was another inconve|nience. For though they had a &s;trong-box, yet it was filled with nothing but bills of parcels, and accounts pre&s;ented for pay|ment, contracts of loans, and indentures for &s;ervices. No money could be had from any of the families, but by their own vol|untary con&s;ent; and to gain this con&s;ent there was great difficulty. Some had ad|vanced what they &s;uppo&s;ed to be more than their proportion; others had paid le&s;s. The former would give no more, till the latter had made up their quotas, and there was no authority which could call any one to account, or make him do his duty. Their whole e&s;tates were mortgaged for the money which they had borrowed of Mr. Lewis and Mr. Frog; and yet they could carry on no bu&s;ine&s;s in partner&s;hip.
<PB N="176" REF="030051_0175_0FE4172688A82FC0">
In fact they had formed &s;uch an unheard of kind of partner&s;hip, that though they could run them&s;elves in debt, yet they could not oblige one another to rai&s;e any money to di&s;charge their debts.</P>
<P>EACH family, however, carried on a &s;ep|arate trade, and they contrived to under&s;ell each other, both at home and at market. Each family al&s;o had a &s;eparate debt, which &s;ome were providing means to di&s;charge, and others neglected. In one or two of the families they went to loggerheads among them&s;elves. John Codline's family was, for &s;everal days, a &s;cene of confu&s;ion and di&s;order; nothing was &s;een or heard, but cur&s;ing and calling names, kicking &s;hins and pulling no&s;es. John at fir&s;t tried to &s;ilence them by gentle means, but finding the&s;e ineffectual, he at length drew his hanger, and &s;wore he would cut off the ears of the fir&s;t that &s;hould dare to make any more noi&s;e. This threatening drove two or three turbulent fellows out of doors, after which the hou&s;e was tolerably quiet.
<PB N="177" REF="030051_0176_0FE4172831FB9BC8">
Something of the &s;ame kind happened in Robert Lumber's family, but he made &s;o good a u&s;e of his fi&s;t as quelled the di&s;turb|ance at once.</P>
<P>IN the family of Roger Carrier there &s;eemed to be a predominant lurch for knavery, for he publickly adverti&s;ed that he was ready to pay his debts by notes of hand, &s;ubject to a di&s;count, the amount of which was indefinite, becau&s;e continually increa&s;ing; and that whoever did not take his pay, when thus offered, might go with|out. The other families were alarmed at his conduct; but had no power to oblige him to deal hone&s;tly, and he carried his roguery &s;o far, as to bid them all defiance.</P>
<P>IN this &s;tate of debility and di&s;traction, it became nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult on &s;ome mea&s;ures for a better plan of union. They began to be convinced that they were not <HI>beavers,</HI> nor capable of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;ociety as had been adopted from them. Something more energetic was

wanted to compel the lazy, to check the knavi&s;h, to direct the indu&s;trious, and to keep the hone&s;t from being impo&s;ed up|on. It had been often in contemplation to amend the mode of partner&s;hip; but now the di&s;orders in &s;ome of the families be|came &s;o alarming, that though they had been quelled for the pre&s;ent, it was un|certain whether they would not break out again, e&s;pecially as one whole family &s;eem|ed determined openly to patronize roguery.

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not in my power to give you a particular detail of the whole proceedings of the meeting, which was held to reform the plan of partner&s;hip, in the manner of your parliamentary journali&s;ts, who make &s;peeches for the members, perhaps better than &s;ome of them make for them&s;elves; but I will endeavour to give you a &s;ummary
<PB N="180" REF="030051_0179_0FE4172FBA57D250">
of the principles on which they pro|ceeded.</P>
<P>THE profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of the meeting was to reform and amend the plan; but in fact when they came to examine it, they found them&s;elves obliged to pa&s;s the &s;ame &s;entence on it that was once delivered con|cerning the famous poet Alexander Pope, who&s;e u&s;ual ejaculation was <HI>God mend me!</HI> "Mend you," &s;aid a hackney coachman, (looking with contempt on his dwarfi&s;h form and hump back) "it would not be half &s;o much trouble to make a new one."</P>
<P>A NEW one was accordingly entered up|on, and the fundamental principle of it was, not to &s;uppo&s;e men as good as they ought to be, but to take them as they are. "It is true" &s;aid they, "that all men are natu|rally free and equal; it is a very good idea, and ought to be under&s;tood in every con|tract and partner&s;hip which can be formed; it may &s;erve as a check upon ambition and other human pa&s;&s;ions, and put people in mind that they may &s;ome time or other be
<PB N="181" REF="030051_0180_0FE4173164F37518">
called to account by their equals. But it is as true that this equality is de&s;troyed by a thou&s;and cau&s;es which exi&s;t in nature and in &s;ociety. It is true that all bea&s;ts, birds, and fi&s;hes are naturally free and equal in &s;ome re&s;pects, but yet we find them unequal in other re&s;pects, and one becomes the prey of another. There is, and always will be, a &s;uperiority and an inferiority, in &s;pite of all the &s;y&s;tems of metaphy&s;ics that ever exi&s;ted. How can you prevent one man from being &s;tronger, or wi&s;er, or richer than another? and will not the &s;trong overcome the weak? will not the cunning circumvent the fooli&s;h? and will not the borrower become &s;ervant to the lender? Is not this noble, free and independent crea|ture man, nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubject to lords of his own &s;pecies in every &s;tage of his exi&s;t|ence? When a child, is he not under the command of his parents? Send him to &s;chool, place him out as an apprentice, put him on board a &s;hip, enrol him in a compa|ny of militia, mu&s;t he not be &s;ubject to a ma&s;ter? Place him in any kind of &s;ociety
<PB N="182" REF="030051_0181_0FE417357155AB50">
whatever, and he has wants to be &s;upplied, and pa&s;&s;ions to be &s;ubdued; his active pow|ers need to be directed, and his extravagan|ces to be controlled, and if he will not do it him&s;elf, &s;omebody mu&s;t do it for him. Self government is indeed the mo&s;t perfect form of government in the world; but if men will not govern them&s;elves, they mu&s;t have &s;ome governors appointed over them, who will keep them in order, and make them do their duty. Now if there is in fact &s;uch an inequality exi&s;ting among us, why &s;hould we act as if no &s;uch thing exi&s;ted? We have tried the <HI>beaver</HI> &s;cheme of partner|&s;hip long enough, and find it will not do. Let us then adopt the practice of another kind of indu&s;trious animals which we have among us&mdash;Let us imitate the <HI>bees,</HI> who are governed by one &s;upreme head, and, under that direction, conduct their whole econo|my with perfect order and regularity."</P>
<P>ON this principle they drew up an entire new plan, in which there was one chief &s;teward, who was to manage their united
<PB N="183" REF="030051_0182_0FE417371E1DCB08">
intere&s;t, and be re&s;pon&s;ible to the whole for his conduct. He was to have a kind of council to advi&s;e and direct him, and &s;ev|eral inferior officers to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, as there might be occa&s;ion; and a certain contribu|tion was to be levied on the trade, or on the e&s;tates of the whole, which was to make a common &s;tock for the &s;upport of the common intere&s;t; and they were to erect a tribunal among them&s;elves, which &s;hould decide and determine all differences. If nine of the families &s;hould agree to this plan, it was to take place; and the others might or might not adopt it; but if any one &s;hould finally refu&s;e, or if any &s;hould adopt it and afterward fall from it, he was to be looked upon as an outca&s;t, and no per&s;on was to have any connexion with him.</P>
<P>THE meeting having continued a long time, every body became extremely anxious to know what they were about; the doors were kept &s;hut, and no per&s;on whatever was let into the &s;ecret till the whole was
<PB N="184" REF="030051_0183_0FE41738CCCDF828">
completed. A copy was then &s;ent to each family, for them to con&s;ider at their lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>THOUGH curio&s;ity was now gratified, yet anxiety was not relaxed. The new plan of partner&s;hip went by the name of <HI>the fiddle;</HI> tho&s;e who were in favour of it call|ed them&s;elves <HI>fiddlers,</HI> and tho&s;e who oppo|&s;ed it were &s;tyled <HI>antifiddlers.</HI> The former &s;aid it was the be&s;t plan that human wi&s;|dom had ever contrived. The latter imag|ined it "pregnant with mi&s;chief." The former compared it to a &s;trong fence about a rich field of wheat. The latter com|pared it to the whale that &s;wallowed up Jonah.</P>
<P>IN each family a con&s;ultation was held on the que&s;tion, Whether it &s;hould be adopted or not? and liberty was given for every one to &s;peak his mind with the ut|mo&s;t freedom. The objections, an&s;wers, replies, rejoinders, and rebutters, which were produced on this occa&s;ion, would make a curious collection, and form an im|portant
<PB N="185" REF="030051_0184_0FE4173AC66ADA50">
page in the hi&s;tory of man. The <HI>fiddlers</HI> were extremely fond of having it examined, becau&s;e they &s;aid it was like a rich piece of plate, which the more it be rubbed &s;hines the brighter. The <HI>antifiddlers</HI> &s;aid it was like a worm-eaten bottom of a &s;hip, the defects of which would more evi|dently appear, the more it was ripped to pieces; they were therefore for rejecting it at once, without any examination at all.</P>
<P>WHEN they were urged to point out its defects, they would &s;ay, "It is dangerous to put &s;o much power into the hands of any man, or &s;et of men, le&s;t they &s;hould abu&s;e it. Our liberty and property will be &s;afe whil&s;t we keep them our&s;elves, but when we have once parted with them, we may never be able to get them back again."</P>
<P>IF the plan was compared to a <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> then the objection would be made again&s;t build|ing it too high, le&s;t the wind &s;hould blow it down. How &s;hall we guard it again&s;t fire? how &s;hall we &s;ecure it again&s;t rob|bers?
<PB N="186" REF="030051_0185_0FE4173EF29C7B60">
and how &s;hall we keep out rats and mice?</P>
<P>IF it was likened to a <HI>&s;hip,</HI> then it would be a&s;ked, how &s;hall we guard it again&s;t leak|ing? how &s;hall we prevent it from run|ning on the rocks and quick&s;ands?</P>
<P>SOMETIMES it would be compared to a <HI>clock,</HI> then the que&s;tion was, how &s;hall we &s;ecure the pendulum, the wheels and the bal|ance from ru&s;t? who &s;hall keep the key, and who &s;hall we tru&s;t to wind it up?</P>
<P>SOMETIMES it was repre&s;ented by a <HI>pur&s;e,</HI> and then it was &s;aid to be dangerous to let any one hold the &s;trings. Money is a tempting object, and the be&s;t men are lia|ble to be corrupted.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, the whole of the arguments again&s;t it might be &s;ummed up in one word &mdash;JEALOUSY; which is well known to be the highe&s;t degree of republican virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="030051_0186_0FE41740A10EA580">TO &s;hew the futility of the&s;e arguments, it was ob&s;erved by the oppo&s;ite party, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to put it into any man's power to do you good, without at the &s;ame time putting it into his power to do you hurt. If you tru&s;t a barber to &s;have your beard, you put it into his power to cut your throat. If you tru&s;t a baker to make your bread, or a cook to dre&s;s your meat, you put it into the power of each to poi&s;on you; nay, if you venture to lie in the &s;ame bed with your wife, you put it into her power to choak you when you are a&s;leep. Shall we therefore let our beards grow till they are long enough to put into our pock|ets, becau&s;e we are afraid of the barber? &s;hall we &s;tarve our&s;elves becau&s;e the baker and the cook <HI>may</HI> poi&s;on us? and &s;hall we be afraid to go to bed with our wives? Fie, fie, gentlemen, do not indulge &s;uch whims: Be careful in the choice of your barbers, your bakers, your cooks, and your wives; pay them well, and treat them well, and make it their <HI>intere&s;t</HI> to treat you well, and you need not fear them.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="030051_0187_0FE41742A7806188">AFTER much debate and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, &s;ome of the families adopted it without excep|tion, but in others, the oppo&s;ition was &s;o &s;trong that it could not be made to pa&s;s, but by the help of certain <HI>amendments,</HI> which were propo&s;ed; and of the&s;e amend|ments every family which thought proper to make any, made as many as they plea&s;ed. The new plan with its appendage of amend|ments, cut &s;uch a grote&s;que figure, that a certain wag in one of the families, like Jotham the &s;on of Gideon, ridiculed it in the following fable.</P>
<P>"A CERTAIN man hired a taylor to make him a pair of <HI>&s;mall clothes;</HI> the taylor mea&s;|ured him and made the garment. When he had brought it home, the man turned and twi&s;ted and viewed it on all &s;ides; it is too &s;mall here, &s;aid he, and wants to be let out; it is too big here, and wants to be taken in; I am afraid there will be a hole here, and you mu&s;t put on a patch; this button is not &s;trong enough, you mu&s;t &s;et on another. He was going on in this
<PB N="189" REF="030051_0188_0FE417445522CFF8">
manner, when his wife overhearing him, &s;aid, have you put on the &s;mall clothes, my dear? No, &s;aid he. How then, replied &s;he, can you po&s;&s;ibly tell whether they will fit you or not? If I had made &s;uch objec|tions to a gown or a pair of &s;tays before I had put them on, how would you have laughed at my <HI>female</HI> wi&s;dom? The man took his wife's advice, and &s;aved the taylor a deal of trouble."</P>
<P>IN like manner, the new plan of part|ner&s;hip was <HI>tried on,</HI> and was found to fit very well. The amendments were thrown by, for future con&s;ideration; &s;ome of them have been &s;ince adopted, but they are &s;o few and &s;o trifling, as to make no e&s;&s;ential difference.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as a &s;ufficient number of the families had adopted the plan, they began to &s;et it in operation; and unanimou&s;ly cho&s;e for their High Steward and manager, GEORGE, the grand&s;on of Walter Pipeweed. He had &s;erved them &s;o faithfully and gen|erou&s;ly
<PB N="190" REF="030051_0189_0FE4176E2E782DE0">
in conducting the law-&s;uit again&s;t Mr. Bull, that no per&s;on was higher in their confidence. As he would take no reward for his former &s;ervices; &s;o he began this new bu&s;ine&s;s with a declaration of the &s;ame kind, and a prote&s;tation that nothing could have induced him to quit the &s;weets of retirement for the toils of public bu&s;i|ne&s;s, but a di&s;po&s;ition to oblige his numer|ous friends who had united their &s;uffrages in his favour. Every one who knows him is fully convinced of the &s;incerity of his declarations, and he has perhaps as large a &s;hare of the e&s;teem and affection of the people in the&s;e families, as any per&s;on ever could expect from a cour&s;e of faithful and friendly offices.</P>
<P>BESIDES him there is an under &s;teward, a council of advice, a chief clerk, a ca&s;hier, and a ma&s;ter of the hounds. The under &s;teward is a per&s;on of a grave deportment, much reading and &s;trict integrity; he has written a large and valuable treati&s;e on family government, and was largely con|cerned
<PB N="191" REF="030051_0190_0FE4176C36C64EF0">
in effecting the compromi&s;e with Mr. Bull. The council of advice are cho|&s;en from the &s;everal families, and con&s;i&s;t of per&s;ons of the be&s;t education, abilities, and popularity. The chief clerk has the care of the mo&s;t important papers, and the ca&s;hier keeps the key of the &s;trong-box, which <HI>now</HI> has &s;omething in it be&s;ides pa|per. By his advice the debts of the com|pany are put into a fair way of being paid, though &s;ome grumbling &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among tho&s;e who were obliged to &s;ell their notes at a di&s;count. The ma&s;ter of the hounds is an officer, who it was at fir&s;t thought would have very little bu&s;ine&s;s; but as the wild bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t have of late grown very trouble&s;ome, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that he will have his hands full. There is too much of a lurch for hunting among many of the fore&s;ters; and &s;ome have not been a&s;hamed to expre&s;s their wi&s;hes that the whole race of wild creatures was exterminated from the face of the earth. There are others who &s;till continue of the mind, that the&s;e animals are a degenerated part of the <HI>human</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="030051_0191_0FE41773093FB0E8">
&s;pecies, and might yet be recovered if prop|per methods were u&s;ed to tame them; but it is greatly feared, that while the rage for hunting continues, all &s;uch benevolent projects will fail in the execution.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome late hunting matches, the&s;e wild animals di&s;covered &s;o much art and cour|age, that &s;everal of the hunters were laid to &s;leep in the bed of honour; and the re&s;t were obliged to take to their heels, that they might "live to hunt another day." Some per&s;ons are of the mind that it is not be&s;t to &s;eek the&s;e bea&s;ts in their dens, but rather to guard the fields and take care of the poultry at home. Others are for pur|&s;uing them to the thicke&s;t &s;hades of the fore&s;t, and this &s;eems at pre&s;ent to be the prevailing opinion. What the &s;ucce&s;s of it will be, time mu&s;t determine.</P>
<P>SINCE the new partner&s;hip has been e&s;+tabli&s;hed, hu&s;bandry and trade have been carried on bri&s;kly; the hou&s;es are full of good things, and the children are well clad
<PB N="193" REF="030051_0192_0FE41774B4200E20">
and healthy; but there is one inconveni|ence which u&s;ually attends a full hou&s;e, and that is, that <HI>rats</HI> are very numerous, and a <HI>new &s;pecies</HI> of them have lately found their way thither. Some of them are very fat and &s;leek, and are not afraid to appear in open day light; though it is &s;uppo&s;ed they burrow under ground, and have &s;ub|terraneous communications from hou&s;e to hou&s;e. This is an inconvenience again&s;t which no remedy has yet been found; though &s;ome people, from their apparent <HI>voracity,</HI> are of the mind that they will ei|ther prey upon one another, or el&s;e eat till they bur&s;t.</P>
<P>I HAD almo&s;t forgot to tell you that two new families have lately been added to the number of partners. One is that of <HI>Ethan Greenwood,</HI> a &s;tout, lu&s;ty fellow, born in the family of Robert Lumber, but married in|to that of Peter Bullfrog, from whom, after a long di&s;pute, he has got a good tract of land, which originally belonged to his own father, but was &s;urreptitiou&s;ly taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="194" REF="030051_0193_0FE41776643610B8">
of by his father-in-law. The other is <HI>Hunter Longknife</HI>; he was bred in the family of Walter Pipeweed, and has a large &s;hare of his &s;pirit of adventure. Having taken up his re&s;idence in the out&s;kirts of the fore&s;t, he has had many a &s;cuffle with the wild bea&s;ts, who are extremely fond of his green corn and young chickens, when|ever they can get a ta&s;te of them.</P>

northern part, together with &s;ome hunting-&s;eats which he <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> to give up to the fore&s;ters. The chief produce of this north|ern territory is the furs, which are brought to his ware-hou&s;e and wrought up by his trade&s;men. Notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s of his title to the lands of the fore&s;ters, they have not wholly for&s;aken him as a trader. He keeps his fulling-mills at work, and &s;upplies them with cloths of various kinds, but they feel them&s;elves at liberty either to purcha&s;e of him or his neighbours, or to manufacture for them&s;elves. He is rather more complai&s;ant to them in his own &s;hop, than his factors are in &s;ome of his di&s;tant ware-hou&s;es, where they are not allowed to carry their produce to market, nor to re|ceive coffee, cotton, and &s;ugar, as formerly. However, they have found out other places where they can buy the&s;e commodities without a&s;king his permi&s;&s;ion. And as for that capital article TEA, which was the occa&s;ion of beginning the controver&s;y, they now fetch it directly from the original ware-hou&s;e of old <HI>Cang-hi,</HI> where it is man|ufactured.
<PB N="197" REF="030051_0196_0FE4177E63156260">
They purcha&s;e their &s;ilks and mu&s;lins of the fir&s;t makers and dealers, and get their wines directly from the vineyards.</P>
<P>I HAVE before told you that Mr. Bull formerly u&s;ed to &s;end the <HI>ordure</HI> made in his family to enrich the plantations of the fore&s;ters; but &s;ince his quarrel with them, he has been &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s how to di&s;po&s;e of it. At fir&s;t he threw it into the gutter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Convicts employed in lighters on the Thames.</NOTE> before his door. But there was &s;uch a large quantity of it, and the &s;tench which it cau&s;ed was &s;o offen&s;ive, that this expedient would not an&s;wer the end. He then thought of &s;ending it to a place where &s;ome of his family had been employed in <HI>botanizing,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Botany Bay, in New Holland.</NOTE> in hope that by adding to the fertility of the &s;oil, they would find more encouragement to pro&s;ecute their inquiries, and that he &s;hould in time receive &s;ome rent or recompen&s;e. This &s;cheme, like &s;ome others, the product of his fruitful brain, has been hitherto attended with more co&s;t
<PB N="198" REF="030051_0197_0FE3F1A522945B20">
than profit; yet it is &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in, and great expectations are &s;till indulged.</P>
<P>AS to his dome&s;tic affairs, his <HI>wife</HI> &s;till rules him according to her u&s;ual maxims, and keeps up her gaming club, where &s;he wins and lo&s;es alternately; but between the &s;hop and the drawing-room, there is enough gained to pay the intere&s;t of his debt, though it is not imagined he will ever be able to pay the principal. This, like a mill&s;tone about his neck, mu&s;t finally &s;ink him.</P>
<P>YOU may po&s;&s;ibly be curious to know what is become of his <HI>mother,</HI> whom I have formerly mentioned to you as having had &s;ome &s;way in his family. The truth is, that &s;ince he married his pre&s;ent wife, the old lady found her influence decrea&s;ing and retired to her chamber, where &s;he has been for many years confined, and is now whol|ly bed-rid. Mr. and Mrs. Bull, indeed treat the old lady with much decency, and &s;uffer none to intrude upon her, but &s;uch
<PB N="199" REF="030051_0198_0FE417820C2BDC28">
company as &s;he is fond of. Old Madam has all the infirmities of age about her. She will not &s;uffer her&s;elf to be touched nor turned in her bed; nor the room to be aired, nor her linen &s;hifted. She keeps her window-&s;hutters clo&s;ed, and will not admit the lea&s;t ray of light in her apart|ment, but what proceeds from her own candle, which having been once dipped in con&s;ecrated water, is &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s all the virtues of an everla&s;ting taper.</P>
<P>NOW I have &s;poken of Madam's taper, perhaps you will be amu&s;ed with &s;ome ac|count of it. It is a wax candle of a com|mon &s;ize, &s;et in an old-fa&s;hioned &s;ilver can|dle&s;tick richly embo&s;&s;ed and gilt; but the ru&s;t and du&s;t of it are &s;o &s;acred, that it is never permitted to be &s;coured. The tradi|tion is, that this candle&s;tick formerly be|longed to St. Peter, and the candle fir&s;t placed in it, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been light|ed at the SUN, and by a my&s;terious kind of <HI>uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> has been kept burn|ing ever &s;ince. By the light of this taper,
<PB N="200" REF="030051_0199_0FE417869B3725D8">
old Madam reads her bible and books of devotion, which always lie on a table by her bed-&s;ide.</P>
<P>SOME per&s;ons of an incredulous turn of mind, have pretended to call in que&s;tion this my&s;tery; but it is &s;till held &s;acred by the old lady, and by mo&s;t of Mr. Bull's own family. There are &s;ome even among the fore&s;ters of the &s;ame opinion; and &s;uch is the liberality in the&s;e families, that no one is mole&s;ted in the indulgence of any inno|cent whim, which does not affect the peace of the families, nor the intere&s;t of the part|ner&s;hip. It was not long after the re-e&s;tab|li&s;hment of harmony between them and Mr. Bull, that the&s;e per&s;ons &s;ent two can|dles in one lantern, and one in another, to be lighted at this venerable taper, and dipt in the con&s;ecrated water. Two of them were actually lighted in old Madam Bull's pre&s;ence, and to her great &s;atisfaction. The third was lighted at a taper &s;uppo&s;ed to be derived from the &s;ame original, but "hid under a bu&s;hel" in one of &s;i&s;ter Peg's out|hou&s;es,
<PB N="201" REF="030051_0200_0FE417884DB06500">
it not being permitted to burn pub|lickly in her family, where the only candles allowed, are of the manufacture of Geneva.</P>
<P>THERE has been as long a controver&s;y between different opinioni&s;ts on this &s;ub|ject, as between the &s;ectaries in Liliput, about breaking the egg at the big or little end. But it is ea&s;y enough to accommo|date the matter by granting that St. Peter's candle, as well as tho&s;e from Geneva, were originally lighted at the SUN; that the &s;ame &s;ource of light is open to all; and that it is of no con&s;equence of what materials tapers are made, nor in what kind of can|dle&s;ticks they are placed, nor by who&s;e hands they are lighted, provided they <HI>give &s;o clear a light as to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of vi&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>IT remains only that I give you &s;ome account of Mr. Lewis. The adventures in his family have been very &s;ingular. I formerly told you that he feed lawyers to plead the cau&s;e of the fore&s;ters. The&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="030051_0201_0FE41789F5C70B48">
&s;ubtile practitioners &s;oon found that the &s;ame arguments which they were obliged to u&s;e in favour of the fore&s;ters, would apply with equal propriety to the ca&s;e of Mr. Lewis's own family. He had long been a widower, and the family was gov|erned by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of kept mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> only their plea&s;ures and the enriching of their own relations and depend|ants. The tenants were abu&s;ed, the man|&s;ion hou&s;e was dirty and out of repair, and though the rents were paid into the hands of the &s;teward, yet much oppre&s;&s;ion and embezzlement, and little economy, were the con&s;tant topics of complaint.</P>
<P>AFTER the alteration, produced by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lewis's lawyers in the fore&s;t, they began to think it was high time to do &s;omething of the &s;ame kind at home. The only peaceable remedy which they could imagine, was to per&s;uade Mr. Lewis to marry a reputable woman, who would be agreeable to the family. After much argument he was at length brought to &s;ee
<PB N="203" REF="030051_0202_0FE4178C045B14F0">
the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e; and, to prevent a law-&s;uit, with which they threatened him, he con&s;ented to take the wife which they recommended. She is a lady of good &s;en&s;e and polite manners, and treats him with the greate&s;t deference and propriety. She has had the man&s;ion thoroughly repaired, the floors and windows cleaned, and the walls whitewa&s;hed, and is not afraid to let her inmo&s;t apartments be vi&s;ited by the &s;un and air. The building is now commo|dious, whole&s;ome and plea&s;ant, and the dirty dog-kennel,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ba&s;tile, 1789.</NOTE> which &s;tood near the door, is demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>IT is &s;u&s;pected by &s;ome that Lewis &s;till has a hankering after his old connexions, but he profe&s;&s;es love to his new wife in the &s;tronge&s;t terms imaginable. His ca&s;t off mi&s;tre&s;s has had the audacity to in&s;ult the newly married lady, and tell her that &s;he has no bu&s;ine&s;s to occupy <HI>her</HI> apartments; that all Mr. Lewis's profe&s;&s;ions are in&s;incere, and that <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his heart. If

the&s;e ladies &s;hould go to pulling caps, Mr. Lewis will be in a critical &s;ituation, as in|deed every man is when two women are contending for him. It is &s;aid that &s;ome of the neighbouring gentlemen, who prefer concubinage to matrimony, have taken the part of the late mi&s;tre&s;s, and in&s;i&s;t on her re&s;toration to bed and board; but how this matter will terminate, can be decided only by futurity.</P>
<P>HE has al&s;o been very unfortunate in &s;ome of his di&s;tant plantations and facto|ries. His black cattle have caught the horn di&s;temper; &s;ome of his farm hou&s;es have been burnt, and it is thought that &s;everal years will intervene before his affairs will be &s;et to rights.</P>
<P>THUS, my friend, I have endeavoured to fulfil my promi&s;e by giving you &s;uch an account as I have been able to procure of the fore&s;ters and their connexions. I a&s;&s;ure you I am extremely delighted with the country and its improvements, which ex|ceed

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING a&s;&s;ured that my former let|ters have afforded &s;ome entertainment to you and your friends, I &s;hall with plea&s;|ure re&s;ume my pen agreeable to your re|que&s;t, and continue my account of the For|e&s;ters and their connexions.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="030051_0206_0FE41795A478E618">MY la&s;t gave you the late&s;t information which could then be had, relative to the families of Mr. Bull and Mr. Lewis; and it is proper for me to begin where I left off, becau&s;e the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e two eternal rivals have had &s;ome influence, and I fear will always have too much on the &s;en|timents and tran&s;actions of my favourite fore&s;ters. For, notwith&s;tanding all that dignity and independence of character which really exi&s;t among them, and which ought to prevail over every inferior princi|ple, yet there are per&s;ons in all the&s;e fam|ilies, who, from local and commercial at|tachments, or from natural and political connexions, are &s;trongly inclined to imitate the manners and adopt the principles of one or the other of tho&s;e ancient rivals.</P>
<P>I HAVE told you, that there was a &s;u&s;pi|cion of a hankering which Lewis indulged toward his ca&s;t off mi&s;tre&s;s; and that the neighbouring gentlemen favoured the in|trigue. This &s;u&s;picion has been &s;adly ver|ified, and a long and bitter controver&s;y has
<PB N="208" REF="030051_0207_0FE417989042E720">
en&s;ued between Lewis and the new wife who had been impo&s;ed on him. Her jeal|ou&s;y was rai&s;ed to a mon&s;trous pitch, and the proofs of his infidelity became &s;o fla|grant, that nothing would &s;atisfy her but a divorce, not barely <HI>&agrave; men&s;a et thoro</HI> but <HI>&agrave; v&igrave;nculo matrimonii.</HI> After a long and &s;ol|emn hearing, the &s;entence was pronounced in due form, and approved by the major part of the family; who, in con&s;equence, turned him out of doors. The minor part, who adhered to him, were &s;o roughly hand|led by the majority, that &s;uch of them as could, were glad to e&s;cape, leaving the re&s;t maimed and wounded on the floors; which were &s;o &s;tained with blood, that they look|ed as if the famous Doctor Sangrado<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Adventures of Gil Blas.</NOTE>, and all his imps had been fully employed in their favourite operation.</P>
<P>SUCH was the noi&s;e and uproar on this occa&s;ion, that all the neighbours, and e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e who favoured Lewis's intrigue&punc; were alarmed. Mr. Bull, who&s;e choler
<PB N="209" REF="030051_0208_0FE4179A8D8A04C8">
you know is very ea&s;ily rai&s;ed, took this opportunity to &s;wear the peace again&s;t the whole family of which Lewis was lately at the head. Not content with this, which might have pa&s;&s;ed merely for a defen&s;ive mea&s;ure, he entered a complaint to the grand jury, and had a bill found again&s;t them "for riotous, routous and di&s;orderly behaviour," and determined to pro&s;ecute them with the utmo&s;t rigour of the law. For, &s;aid he, within him&s;elf, "If the&s;e fellows are &s;uffered to go on at this rate, they will &s;et a fine example to their neighbours, and turn every thing up&s;ide down. If the conduct of ma&s;ters does not happen to hit the humours of &s;er|vants, we &s;hall all be turned out of doors as well as Lewis. Poor devil! I once hated him as heartily as any body; but now he is in di&s;tre&s;s, I pity him, and can &s;ay as Ahab did to Benhadad, <HI>he is my brother.</HI> If &s;uch principles and conduct &s;hould pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed, no ma&s;ter can be &s;ure of his property, or power; all family govern|ment is at an end, and a &s;trong-box is no
<PB N="210" REF="030051_0209_0FE4179C86464AF0">
&s;ecurity. It is evidently my duty to be&s;tir my&s;elf; and be&s;ides, what a fine oppor|tunity is now pre&s;ented to revenge the conduct of this officious family, who meddled in my controver&s;y with the for|e&s;ters! Now I will pay them double and round."</P>
<P>TO carry this re&s;olve into execution, he entered into articles of agreement with Lord Strut and Nicholas Frog to &s;tand by him; and gave large fees to the mo&s;t able pleaders, particularly to <HI>Ferdinand, Frederic</HI> and <HI>Leopold,</HI> who profe&s;&s;ed to have an inter|e&s;t of their own in &s;upporting his cau&s;e. The&s;e crafty brethren of the long robe, after making a formal parade of their elo|quence at the bar, contrived by various pretences and &s;tratagems, well known in their profe&s;&s;ion, to &s;pin out the cau&s;e, and require additional &s;ums of money; which Mr. Bull generou&s;ly, and even profu&s;ely advanced. For it is a &s;ettled maxim with him, never to &s;poil any piece of work for fear of expen&s;e. This being well known
<PB N="211" REF="030051_0210_0FE4179E2DAE0BC8">
to tho&s;e whom he employs, they are never in a hurry to fini&s;h a job; and why &s;hould they, when they have &s;o able and ready a pay-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>WHAT became of Mr. Lewis after his divorce and expul&s;ion, is uncertain. A let|ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Manife&s;to of Louis XVIII.</NOTE> has appeared, pretending to have been written by him, which &s;peaks in &s;trong terms of the ill treatment he has received, and contains a &s;trange compound of &s;ever|ity and lenity toward the family. Some are &s;till of opinion that he may be re&s;tored; but it is generally thought that he will not be able very &s;oon to &s;how his <HI>head</HI> again among his old neighbours.</P>
<P>THE changes which took place in the family after his expul&s;ion, were numerous and rapid. The new wife did not long pre&s;erve her dignity, but was frequently tou&s;led and tumbled by the rude hand of every frolick&s;ome fellow in the hou&s;e. The name of Lewis was expunged from
<PB N="212" REF="030051_0211_0FE417A2AB6D0120">
the &s;ign-board, and in its place was &s;ub&s;ti|tuted the name of &s;ome remote ance&s;tors of the family who were called <HI>The Franks,</HI> and by this firm the hou&s;e is now known. Various devices were propo&s;ed for a new coat of arms; one was a wheel within a wheel, with the word <HI>Jacobina</HI> for a motto. Another was a bloody <HI>robe</HI> mounted on a <HI>&s;pear,</HI> with the motto, <HI>in terrorem.</HI> But it &s;eems to be at length determined, that <HI>three</HI> plain &s;tripes of white, red and blue, &s;hall be the device, with the motto <HI>une et indivi&s;ible.</HI> Had there been but one colour, the motto would have been more intelli|gible.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all their inte&s;tine divi&s;ions, and their daily and nightly broils among them&s;elves; yet the Franks have had the addre&s;s to &s;how a bold face to their adver&s;aries, and to defend their cau&s;e in the law with a re&s;olution truly honourable. Their re&s;ources are &s;uppo&s;ed to be con&s;id|erable. Tho&s;e who quitted the family were not permitted to carry off their clothes and
<PB N="213" REF="030051_0212_0FE417A4577DF638">
trunks, &s;ome of which contained a valuable booty. The old family plate and jewels, and the ornaments of the devotional clo&s;et, have been &s;old at auction. The real e&s;tate is in effect mortgaged, by promi&s;&s;ory notes, i&s;&s;ued on its credit, which, though they have greatly depreciated in the market, by rea&s;on of forgeries carried on in Mr. Bull's family, and by his connivance, yet will probably be redeemed at &s;ome rate of di&s;|count at pre&s;ent unknown.</P>
<P>THE Franks have al&s;o found means to &s;ilence Mr. Bull's mo&s;t powerful pleaders, notwith&s;tanding the large fees they received from him. They have even detached Ni|cholas Frog from his connexions with Bull, and taken him into partner&s;hip with them|&s;elves; though it is whi&s;pered that Nicholas is not over and above plea&s;ed with the new mode of <HI>fraternization,</HI> as it hath brought him into a law-&s;uit with Bull, who at once laid attachments on all his &s;ilks and &s;pices. Lord Strut has al&s;o di&s;engaged him&s;elf from the concern; Bull grins hor|ribly
<PB N="214" REF="030051_0213_0FE417A64CDAC968">
at him for his in&s;incerity, and threat|ens to &s;ieze all his plate and bullion, (of which he has an immen&s;e quantity) to make good the damage.</P>
<P>HAVING introduced the word <HI>fraterniza|tion,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you that this is one &s;peci|men, and there are many others, of that liberty which the Franks have a&s;&s;umed, of coining words. It has been the practice of the family for a long time, and they have been flattered by the frequent adop|tion and u&s;e of their new words in oth|er families, who always regarded them as the mo&s;t polite and plau&s;ible, if not the mo&s;t deeply learned in the whole neighbour|hood. When words have a real and defi|nite meaning, it is of no con&s;equence who is the original coiner of them, nor by whom they are brought into u&s;e; but every one is fond of the productions of his own brain, and every one has a right to claim and en|joy the honour (if there is any) belonging to &s;uch productions. Never was a word better adapted to any particular purpo&s;e
<PB N="215" REF="030051_0214_0FE417A7F47F58A8">
than this. To <HI>fraternize,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of the Franks, is to <HI>make brethren;</HI> to coax, or bribe, or compel, or u&s;e means of any kind whatever with other people to <HI>make</HI> them brethren.</P>
<P>AFTER the divorce and expul&s;ion of Mr. Lewis, the majority, who a&s;&s;umed to gov|ern the family, were &s;o intoxicated with the idea of the liberty which they enjoyed in being free from their ma&s;ter, in tou&s;ling and handling their mi&s;tre&s;s, in picking the locks and &s;earching the trunks of the de|&s;erters, and breaking up the old family hordes, that they began to think this was a kind of liberty which all families had a right to enjoy as well as them&s;elves. They came therefore to a re&s;olution, to endea|vour as far as in them lay, to extend the ble&s;&s;ings of this liberty to their neigh|bours, beginning with the neare&s;t. They made offers of &s;ervice, either &s;ecretly or openly, to bring on revolutions among them, or as they metaphorically expre&s;&s;ed it, "to plant the tree of liberty in their
<PB N="216" REF="030051_0215_0FE417AC6691E6C0">
gardens." This was what they meant by <HI>fraternization.</HI> All who favoured their ideas in other men's families were called <HI>democrats,</HI> and tho&s;e who were not fond of the fraternizing plan were termed <HI>ari&s;to|crats,</HI> words al&s;o of their own coining. To &s;how their contempt of all titular di&s;tinc|tions, they di&s;u&s;ed the appellations of Sir, Mon&s;ieur, your Honor, and the like, and &s;ub&s;tituted the name of <HI>citizen,</HI> which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be equally applicable to all. But to expre&s;s their own mo&s;t <HI>mode&s;t</HI> opinion of them&s;elves, in the lowe&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible terms, they affected the name of <HI>Sans-culotte,</HI> which in plain Engli&s;h &s;ignifies <HI>bare</HI>-****; a word, before this time ap|plied only to tho&s;e mo&s;t contemptible of the &s;pecies who were too lazy to earn enough to buy a pair of &s;mall-clothes. To &s;uch ridiculous lengths will people go, when they &s;uffer their enthu&s;ia&s;tic imagination to get the better of their judgment! But the wi&s;e&s;t have their foibles; and, who is there that cannot recollect, in the cour&s;e of his life, &s;ome in&s;tances of indi&s;cretion?</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="030051_0216_0FE417AE4AE67760">I SHOULD not have detained your atten|tion &s;o long to this article, had there not been a very ab&s;urd attempt made to extend the plan of fraternization to the Fore&s;ters; who were already the elder brethren of the Franks, both in principle and conduct, and heartily wi&s;hed well to their cau&s;e&mdash;But of this you &s;hall hear more in my next.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE already given you &s;ome idea of the fraternizing &s;cheme of the Franks; I &s;hall now inform you of the means by which they attempted to intro|duce it among the fore&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="030051_0220_0FE417B71A5EB798">MANY of the Franks had been in the fore&s;t, and had vi&s;ited the plantations and families there, not only during the law-&s;uit with Bull, but after the di&s;pute had been terminated. They had kept journals and made remarks on manners, economy, hu&s;|bandry, manufactures, literature, and other things worthy of notice. After they had effected the expul&s;ion of their ma&s;ter, the&s;e travellers were very fond of introducing the &s;ame family economy which they had ob&s;erved among the Fore&s;ters, and of ex|tending the ble&s;&s;ings of fraternity to them, by drawing them into the controver&s;y in which they were engaged. "Why &s;hould not the&s;e fore&s;ters (&s;aid they) bear a part of our burden, as we did of their's. We involved our&s;elves in their quarrel with Bull, and helped them to terminate it in their favour. One good turn de&s;erves another; and it is now time for them to enter into our controver&s;y, and help us in the &s;ame way."</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="030051_0221_0FE417B8C52F7BF0">TO execute this plan, they di&s;patched a plau&s;ible, prattling, in&s;inuating petit-maitre, by the name of TENEG, who had been em|ployed in fraternizing the family of CAL|VINO, a famous di&s;tiller of gin,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gin is an abbreviation of Geneva</NOTE> and had there been very &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>ARTIFICES of the &s;ame kind will not &s;ucceed on all &s;orts of per&s;ons; but a vari|ation mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, according to the variety of humours, intere&s;ts and prejudi|ces. The fore&s;ters were well known to be a wary and di&s;cerning, as well as in|genious kind of people, and fond of novel|ties. To hit their ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and there|by influence or deceive their judgment, Te|neg was furni&s;hed with a ba&s;ket of birds' eggs, of a new &s;pecies, which had recently appeared in the gardens of the Franks. Of the&s;e birds, I cannot give you the name and de&s;cription, nor do I know whether they are included in any of the cla&s;&s;es found by naturali&s;ts; but to &s;peak in the vulgar phra&s;e they are known, in &s;ome places, by
<PB N="223" REF="030051_0222_0FE417BABB40A7C8">
the name of <HI>war-hawks</HI>; rather improperly, I think, becau&s;e the hawk though a fero|cious is yet a &s;ilent bird; whereas the&s;e are &s;o very noi&s;y that they &s;eem to belong to the pettrel tribe, and have been not improp|erly called <HI>Mother Carey's Chickens,</HI> from their re&s;emblance to a bird of that name, which is well known to chirp and whi&s;tle at the approach and during the height of a &s;torm.</P>
<P>THESE birds have &s;ome peculiarities, which mu&s;t be con&s;idered as characteri&s;tic of the &s;pecies. One is, that they vary their note according to the in&s;truction of their keepers; in this re&s;pect they re&s;emble the magpye and the mock-bird. Their u&s;ual &s;ound, when not under any particular direc|tion, is a dull monotony, an eternal repeti|tion of <HI>jaco, jaco, jaco;</HI> but they have been taught to &s;ound other words which terminate with a vowel, or a liquid con&s;onant; &s;uch as, <HI>war, war, war;&mdash;whi&s;ky, whi&s;ky, whi&s;ky, &mdash;ja, ja, ja,</HI> &amp;c. If they chance to hear the whetting of a knife, or the &s;napping of a
<PB N="224" REF="030051_0223_0FE417BEF7145398">
trigger, or any noi&s;e which &s;eems to be a preparation for mi&s;chief, they will readily imitate it, and the &s;ound will catch from one to another like a feu-de-joye. It is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee how ea&s;ily they can be trained and di&s;ciplined. Teneg, with a bird-call, which he carried in his mouth, could bring them by dozens to light on his head and &s;houlders, and even dive into his pocket, to pick the grains which he carried there to feed them. He could make them flutter about him in all directions, and imi|tate any noi&s;e which he was plea&s;ed to make. It is &s;aid, that he has imparted this &s;ecret to &s;ome choice &s;pirits, his a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>ANOTHER peculiarity of the&s;e birds is, that they &s;eem to have an aver&s;ion to &s;ome particular days, and a predilection for oth|ers. On the twenty-&s;econd of February they are &s;carcely ever &s;een on the wing, and are remarkably &s;ilent; but on the tenth of Augu&s;t, and the twenty-&s;econd of September, they appear in great numbers, and are heard to whi&s;tle through the
<PB N="225" REF="030051_0224_0FE417C0A39F79F0">
whole day. The cau&s;e of this peculiarity is one of the &s;ecrets of nature, which, it is hoped, the learned will in time be able to penetrate. The vulgar &s;uppo&s;ition is, that their hilarity in the months of Augu&s;t and September is owing to the great quantity of the &s;eeds of water-melons, which are then to be found, and of which they are &s;aid to be remarkably fond. But this is altogether a vague conjecture, and unwor|thy of a philo&s;ophic mind.</P>
<P>YOU will now be ready to a&s;k, how were the&s;e eggs to be hatched? and what u&s;e could be made of the birds if they &s;hould be hatched? To the fir&s;t, I an&s;wer&mdash;Teneg was well informed that there were certain <HI>old hens</HI> in the fore&s;t, who would readily perform the office of incubation. To the &s;econd&mdash;By a due management of the birds, and principally by the force of their notes, it was expected that they would excite in the fore&s;ters, and their children, the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition to mi&s;chief, with which them|&s;elves
<PB N="226" REF="030051_0225_0FE417C29A4042B8">
were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and thus prepare the way for a complete <HI>fraternization.</HI></P>
<P>TENEG arrived fir&s;t in the plantation of Charles Indigo; where he placed &s;ome of his eggs under an old hen, and &s;cattered the &s;eeds of a particular &s;pecies of grain, on which the chickens were to &s;ub&s;i&s;t till they could pick for them&s;elves. So prolif|ic was the brooding warmth of the old hen, that the eggs were &s;oon hatched, and the chicks began their natural cry, <HI>jaco, jaco, jaco;</HI> but were &s;oon taught the note <HI>war, war, war.</HI> The effect was &s;o &s;urprizing, that &s;everal of Mr. Indigo's dome&s;tics im|mediately roared out the war-whoop, equip|ped them&s;elves in the habit of highway|men, and took to the road, with a view to rob any of Mr. Bull's family, or plunder any of his waggons, which they might chance to meet in an unguarded and de|fencele&s;s &s;tate.</P>
<P>TENEG was &s;o &s;lu&s;hed with this &s;ucce&s;s, that he ha&s;ted to the other plantations, di&s;|tributing
<PB N="227" REF="030051_0226_0FE417C445FA8868">
the eggs with his own hands, or &s;ending them by tru&s;ty me&s;&s;engers, who were well acquainted with the ne&s;ts of the old hens. A brood was &s;oon hatched in each of the plantations, who began their cackling as &s;oon as they were out of the &s;hell. The effect was not &s;o great in all parts, as it was in Indigo's plantation; for though the mu&s;ic excited &s;everal per&s;ons to kick up a war-dance, and become knights of the highway; yet the number was far greater who &s;aw through the artifice, and combined to defeat it. Still, however, the noi&s;e of the chickens was continued, and the highwaymen became &s;o impudent, that when Mr. Bull heard what was doing, he began to &s;well with choler again&s;t the for|e&s;ters. "Cur&s;e the&s;e fellows, (&s;aid he) do they intend to aid the Franks again&s;t me? I'll begin with them betimes. The high|way is mine; I'll &s;eize their waggons, and ruin their <HI>carrying trade;</HI> and if they have a mind for another law-&s;uit, I am their match." Accordingly, as lord of the manor, he &s;ent out his hunt&s;men
<PB N="228" REF="030051_0227_0FE417C8A3B6FD78">
and hounds, &s;eized &s;everal of their wag|gons and drove them into inclo&s;ures, where they might be &s;ecured till a court-manor could be holden for <HI>adjudication</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t con&s;iderate among the fore&s;t|ers were greatly incen&s;ed, on account of the plots thus formed again&s;t them. Though they re&s;pected the family of the Franks, and rejoiced at their emancipation from the old ab&s;urd &s;y&s;tem of family govern|ment, under which they had long groaned; though they made no &s;cruple publickly to own them as friends and brethren; yet they could not approve all the whims and innovations, which had crept into the fam|ily; nor did they reli&s;h the plan of frater|nization, as the Franks intended to carry it on. They hated the cackling of the chick|ens, and wi&s;hed they had peri&s;hed in the &s;hell: but they were loth to quarrel with the whole family for the folly and vanity of their &s;ervant; e&s;pecially as tho&s;e who had the principal hand in &s;ending him were in di&s;grace, and another &s;et had got the di|rection
<PB N="229" REF="030051_0228_0FE4180D9FB7BC58">
of the hou&s;e. They had at the &s;ame time a high re&s;entment again&s;t Bull for &s;eizing their waggons, but thought the be&s;t way of getting them back again was by remon&s;trance and per&s;ua&s;ion. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, a con&s;ultation was held by the council of advice, at which pre&s;ided their tru&s;ty High Steward, GEORGE, the grand&s;on of Walter Pipeweed, than whom there is not, perhaps, a man who carries more wi&s;dom in his head, more goodne&s;s in his heart, or more vigour in his nerves. George has had enough of law-&s;uits; and though he will &s;uffer no man to wrong him with impunity, yet he had rather compro|mi&s;e difficulties than inflame them by op|po&s;ition. The re&s;ult of the con&s;ultation was, that a letter be written to the Franks, in a very friendly &s;tyle, complaining of Teneg, and reque&s;ting that a better man might be &s;ent in his place; that a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger be &s;ent to Bull, to demand &s;ati&s;|faction for the damage they had &s;u&s;tained from his hunt&s;men; at the &s;ame time di&s;|claiming the conduct of the highwaymen;
<PB N="230" REF="030051_0229_0FE417CA5046BB98">
and declaring that they did not intend to meddle with the quarrel between Mr. Bull and the Franks; but to be in friend&s;hip with both, and trade with both as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner was this determination known, than tho&s;e who had the direction of the chickens, &s;et them on rai&s;ing a terrible cry, of <HI>war, war, war&mdash;ja, ja, ja.</HI> This was very trouble&s;ome and provoking; but it was thought mo&s;t prudent to bear with their impertinent vociferation for a while, in hope that they would &s;oon quit the plantations. For as they had come in all at once, it was not known but that they were birds of pa&s;&s;age, and might di&s;appear at the &s;ea&s;on of migration; but even if they &s;hould continue, there was an expec|tation that means might be found to tame and &s;ilence them, and perhaps render them in &s;ome degree u&s;eful.</P>
<P>AN experiment of this kind was actually made. A flock of the&s;e chickens, under the direction of a mi&s;chievous old hen,
<PB N="231" REF="030051_0230_0FE417CC4B96BC60">
once got into a field of William Broadbrim, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of his plantation, and &s;et up a cry of <HI>whi&s;ky, whi&s;ky, whi&s;ky.</HI> The noi&s;e was &s;o very loud, and their number was &s;o large, that it was feared they would devour the crop, then almo&s;t ripe for the &s;ickle. A company of archers was there|fore &s;ent out, with orders to try the effect of &s;ome particular &s;ounds, before they &s;hould di&s;charge their arrows. They crept along, making &s;everal kinds of noi&s;e, to no pur|po&s;e, till they had got very near, when they &s;et up a loud cry of <HI>Wa&s;h, Wa&s;h, Wa&s;h,</HI> which entirely drowned the noi&s;e of <HI>whi&s;ky,</HI> and was &s;o formidable to the chickens, that they &s;lew away with precipitation, and be|came remarkably &s;ilent. They have not only made no more di&s;turbance in that quarter, but &s;ome of them have &s;ince been ob&s;erved hovering about the barn-yards, and mixing with the common poultry.</P>
<P>THE letter &s;ent to the Franks was well received, and produced the de&s;ired effect. Teneg was di&s;qualified and &s;uper&s;eded;
<PB N="232" REF="030051_0231_0FE417CDF40BEDC8">
but he did not think it proper to return, le&s;t he &s;hould lo&s;e his ears. He has &s;ince married a girl of the family of Peter Bull|frog, and taken up his abode in the fore&s;t; and, &s;uch is the good-natured policy of the&s;e people, that he is permitted to re&s;ide among them, and to enjoy what he has earned, without any inquiry how he came by it; provided that he pays his taxes and lives peaceably.</P>
<P>THE me&s;&s;enger who went to Mr. Bull, was a long time in con&s;ultation with his clerk, before all matters could be adju&s;ted to mutual &s;atisfaction. The re&s;ult, howev|er, was a tolerable compromi&s;e; in which Bull engaged to give up the hunting-&s;eats which he had &s;o long withheld, on condi|tion that the <HI>whole</HI> body of the fore&s;ters &s;hould become bound to pay the balance of an old account, due to him from the <HI>&s;outhern</HI> planters. He al&s;o promi&s;ed to let the di&s;|puted limits be adju&s;ted by a committee; to expedite the manor-courts, in which the tre&s;pa&s;&s;es &s;hould be fairly tried; and to
<PB N="233" REF="030051_0232_0FE417D1A15468E0">
pay damages if awarded. Other matters which had been in di&s;pute were adju&s;ted; but one clau&s;e was in&s;erted, which prohib|ited them from trading at his &s;ugar ware|hou&s;e, unle&s;s they &s;hould carry their pro|duce in waggons of no larger &s;ize than a wheelbarrow&punc; This article was &s;o &s;ingular and ridiculous, that the council of fore&s;ters rejected it. The other parts of the agree|ment met the approbation of twenty out of thirty, which made the in&s;trument valid, and it was &s;igned, &s;ealed, publi&s;hed and declared in due form.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as this tran&s;action was known, and even before the in&s;trument was execu|ted, tho&s;e choice &s;pirits whom Teneg had in&s;tructed, as afore&s;aid, in the u&s;e of the bird-call, &s;et all the chickens a crying <HI>ja, ja, ja&mdash;treaty, treaty, treaty.</HI> The &s;ound rang through the fore&s;t, and was reverber|ated from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and from tree to tree, in &s;uch a &s;urprizing manner, that no other noi&s;e could, for a while, be heard. Some very &s;ober people were actually deaf|ened;
<PB N="234" REF="030051_0233_0FE417D3A0C21FA8">
others were vexed with the clamour. But con&s;idering from what cau&s;e it pro|ceeded, they determined to let the chickens cry till they were weary; and then calmly and coolly to examine the rea&s;ons which influenced their keepers thus to &s;et them a cackling. This examination has been done in a very ma&s;terly manner; and the peo|ple in general are pretty well &s;atisfied with the compromi&s;e. They &s;ee, that though it is not altogether to their wi&s;hes, yet it is the be&s;t bargain that could be made. They &s;ee that it has prevented a long law-&s;uit, the i&s;&s;ue of which mu&s;t have been uncer|tain; and they had rather enjoy the ble&s;|&s;ings of cultivation and of &s;ending their pro|duce to market, than &s;pend their money in paying council, attornies, &s;olicitors, &s;criven|ers and bailiffs; of which kind of drudgery they have already done enough to make the pre&s;ent generation &s;ick of &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE remained one effort more, which the di&s;ciples of Teneg were determined to
<PB N="235" REF="030051_0234_0FE417D59B2416F0">
make, to prevent the agreement from being carried into effect. It was nece&s;&s;ary that a &s;um of money &s;hould be allowed for travel|ing charges, clerks' fees, and other incident|al expen&s;es. When this matter came to be debated in the council of advice, a flock of the chickens, who had been trained for the purpo&s;e, flew into the hall, perched on the table and chairs, and began to cackle with a new note in addition to their former vociferations. <HI>Papers, papers, papers.</HI> Two of them had the impudence to alight on the &s;houlders of the High Steward, as he &s;at mu&s;ing in his elbow-chair, and, putting their bills into his ears to &s;quall this har&s;h note. GEORGE bore it a while calmly, and continued his contemplations; till, at length, with his deep-grum voice, and with a determined air and manner, he pronounc|ed the mono&s;yllable <HI>No,</HI> &s;o forcibly, that the cackling cea&s;ed, and the chickens re|tired to their managers, for farther in&s;truc|tion. Their invention was ready, and &s;ome pains were taken to teach them the &s;ame mono&s;yllable <HI>No,</HI> with the addition of the
<PB N="236" REF="030051_0235_0FE417D7486A3878">
word <HI>&s;upply.</HI> This was the mo&s;t difficult ta&s;k which had yet been attempted; and it took them &s;o long to learn it, that the neighbours, who ob&s;erved what was going on, had time to <HI>blow the horn,</HI> to call the people together, and put an end to the in|&s;ults of this noi&s;y brood. At the &s;ound of the horn, the chickens were frightened; &s;ome to &s;ave their necks from being wrung, flew off in various directions; others hid them&s;elves and remained &s;ilent; till the council had fini&s;hed their deliberation, and voted the money. The only ill con&s;equence of this di&s;turbance, was a little delay in the execution of the agreement, which all good men had the candour to impute to the true cau&s;e.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the appearance of good will on the part of Mr. Bull, there are many who think he &s;till looks with an envious eye on the Fore&s;ters, and is jealous of their enterprizing &s;pirit, and of their exten&s;ive and growing commerce. Their agents and factors are &s;een in all
<PB N="237" REF="030051_0236_0FE417DB50B7C130">
tho&s;e ware-hou&s;es, from which he had been u&s;ed to fetch commodities by whole&s;ale, and di&s;po&s;e of them by retail at very ad|vanced prices. There is no place to which they cannot find as ready acce&s;s as him&s;elf, and where they cannot trade on equal terms. It is not long &s;ince he &s;ent a very pompous me&s;&s;enger to old Cang-hi, the tea manufacturer, with his compliments, re|que&s;ting that he might have &s;ome <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> advantages in trade, at his ware-hou&s;e; and to ingratiate him&s;elf the better, this me&s;&s;en|ger carried a number of valuable pre&s;ents, which, it was thought would be highly ac|ceptable. The old gentleman received the me&s;&s;enger, and &s;ome of the pre&s;ents, with his u&s;ual politene&s;s; but ob&s;erving the &s;upercilious air of the me&s;&s;enger, he quick|ly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with this &s;ententious re|ply. "My ance&s;tors have taught wi&s;dom to their de&s;cendants. Their pictures and their maxims are delineated in this book, which I pre&s;ent to thy ma&s;ter. Tell him there is no friend&s;hip in trade. My doors are open to all cu&s;tomers, and every man is wel|come for his money."</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="030051_0237_0FE417DCF915F3E0">WHEN the Fore&s;ters heard of this &s;aga|cious reply, they could not help laughing in their &s;leeves, at the mortification which old Bull mu&s;t have received from it.</P>
<P>YOU will wi&s;h to know on what terms the&s;e people are with the wild bea&s;ts on their we&s;tern border. Since I wrote to you concerning them, a &s;trong hunting party has been &s;ent out, who have driven them from their old haunts, and have erect|ed lodges in the mo&s;t convenient places, where future hunt&s;men may re&s;ide. But as the creatures appear to be le&s;s formida|ble, and their ferocity is evidently in the <HI>wane,</HI> it has been thought be&s;t to entice them to peace, and admit them to familiar|ity. The old practice is revived of &s;etting mola&s;&s;es for them to lick, and furni&s;hing them with collars and no&s;e-jewels. But above all, a line has been drawn, beyond which no per&s;on is permitted to make any plantation. This precaution is one of the be&s;t which could be invented, and it is hoped will have &s;o good an effect, as to keep the neighbours out of fear of being devoured.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="030051_0238_0FE417DEF1F2DD80">BESIDES the compromi&s;e with Bull, the Fore&s;ters have concluded an agreement with two of the Arabian rovers, Muley<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Morocco.</NOTE> and Ha&s;&s;an,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Algiers.</NOTE> which &s;tipulates that they may go about their bu&s;ine&s;s without mole&s;|tation, on the payment of a certain &s;um down, and an annual acknowledgment be|&s;ides.

<P>AN advantageous agreement has al&s;o been made between the Fore&s;ters and Lord Strut, adju&s;ting the limits of his fore&s;t and theirs, and opening a road between them, which is to be free to both parties. Mr. Bull has quietly and honourably given up the hunting-&s;eats, according to the agree|ment, and the Fore&s;ters are in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. This will enable them to extend their plantations and cultivate

their country to the greate&s;t advantage. They are continually making improvements by bridges and canals; and if they &s;hould continue at peace among them&s;elves, unin|fluenced by the quarrels, and untainted by the di&s;&s;ipation and folly of their neighbours, they will be as happy a &s;et of people as any on the globe.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of my former Letters I told you of a new &s;pecies of <HI>rats,</HI> which had appeared in the fore&s;t. I am &s;orry to &s;ay that they not only remain, but are very numerous and mi&s;chievous. They are &s;o &s;ly and eva&s;ive, that they elude all the arts of common rat-catchers; and at the &s;ame time are &s;o bold and impu|dent as to make their appearance in open day-light, in the hou&s;es, roads and fields. Not long &s;ince, a large number of them were &s;een in the dining-room of <HI>George Tru&s;ty;</HI> fir&s;t &s;itting under the table, and catching eve|ry crumb which fell; then leaping on the table, whil&s;t the family were at dinner, and &s;natching the meat out of their plates. George profe&s;&s;ed great indignation at this degree of impudence, and &s;wore that he would permit no &s;uch thing in his hou&s;e; but &s;ome people are &s;o uncharitable as to &s;uppo&s;e this to be only a fi|ne&s;&s;e, and that he &s;ecretly favours them, for &s;ome oc|cult purpo&s;es. Should this imagination prove to be well founded, it is thought that his name will be changed; and that in&s;tead of being called <HI>Tru&s;ty,</HI> he will have a name as long as tho&s;e u&s;ed in Oliver Crom|well's time; <HI>Better known than tru&s;ted.</HI></P>
