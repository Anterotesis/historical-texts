<P>I Have Endeavour'd to the utmo&s;t of my power to perform what was de&s;ired of me, in order to the publick Peace and Safety; and I do not know that any thing hath been omitted which might tend to the pre&s;ervation of them, &s;ince the Admini&s;tration of Affairs was put into my hands. It now lyes upon you to lay the Foundations of a firm Security for your RELIGION, your LAWS, and your LIBERTIES.</P>
<P>I do not doubt, but that by &s;uch a full &amp; free Repre&s;entative of the Nation, as now is met, the Ends of my Declaration will be attained: and &s;ince it hath plea&s;ed GOD, hitherto to ble&s;s my good Intentions with &s;o great Succe&s;s, I tru&s;t in HIM that He will compleat his own Work, by &s;ending a Spirit of peace and Union to Influence your COUNCILS. that no Interruption may be given to an Happy and La&s;ting Settlement. The Dangerous Condition of the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in <HI>Ireland,</HI> require|ing a Large and Speedy Succour, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Things abroad, oblige me to tell you, That next to the Danger of un&s;ea&s;onable Divi|&s;ions among your &s;elves, nothing can be &s;o fatal as too great Delay in your Con&s;ultations. The States by whom I have been enabled to Re&s;cue this Nation, may &s;uddenly feel the ill Effects of it, by being too long deprived of the &s;ervice of their Troops which are now here, and of your early A&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t a powerful Enemy who hath Declared Warr again&s;t them. And as <HI>England</HI> is by Treaty already engaged to help them upon any &s;uch Exigencies, &s;o I am confident that their cheerful Concurrence to pre&s;erve this Kingdom, with &s;o much Hazzard to them&s;elves, will meet with all the Returns of Friend&s;hip, and A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, which may be expected from you as Prote&s;tants and <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> whenever their Occa&s;ions &s;hall require it.</P>
