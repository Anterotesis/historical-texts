<HEAD>An EULOGIUM, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is the high reward of tho&s;e who have ri&s;ked their lives in a <HI>ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary war,</HI> that their names are &s;weet in the mouths of men, and every age &s;hall know their actions. I am happy in having it in my power, before a polite a&s;&s;embly, to expre&s;s what I think of tho&s;e who have ri&s;ked their lives in the <HI>war of America.</HI> I know my abilities ri&s;e not to a level with &s;o great a &s;ubject, but I love the memory of the men, and it is my hope that the affection which I feel, will be to me in&s;tead of genius, and give me warm words to advance their prai&s;es.</P>
<P>I CONCEIVE it as the <HI>fir&s;t honour</HI> of the&s;e men, that before they engaged in the war, they &s;aw it to be <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> They were not the va&s;&s;als of a proud

chieftain, rou&s;ing them, in barbarous times, by the blind impul&s;e of attachment to his family, or engaging them to e&s;pou&s;e his quarrel, by the mu&s;ic and enter|tainments of his ball. They were them&s;elves the chieftains of their own cau&s;e, highly in&s;tructed in the nature of it, and, from the be&s;t principles of patrioti&s;m, re&s;olute to defend it. They had heard the declaration of the court and parliament of Great-Britain, claiming the authority of binding them in <HI>all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</HI> They had examined this claim, and found it to be, as to its foundation, groundle&s;s, as to its nature, tyranni|cal, and as to its con&s;equences, ruinous to the peace and happine&s;s of both countries. On this clear appre|hen&s;ion and decided judgment of the cau&s;e, a&s;certain|ed by their own rea&s;on, and collected from the be&s;t writers, it was the noble purpo&s;e of their minds to &s;tand forth in its defence.</P>
<P>THESE brave men were not &s;oldiers by profe&s;&s;ion, bred to arms, and from a habit of military life attach|ed to it. They were the mechanics of the city, the merchants of the counting-hou&s;e, the youths engaged in literary &s;tudies, and the hu&s;bandmen the peaceful cultivators of the &s;oil. Happy in the &s;ociability and conver&s;ation of the town, the &s;implicity and innocence of the country village, the philo&s;ophic ea&s;e of acade|mic lei&s;ure, and the &s;weets of rural life, they wi&s;h|ed not a change of the&s;e &s;cenes of plea&s;ure, for the dangers and calamities of war. It was the pure love of virtue and of freedom, burning bright within their minds, that alone could engage them to embark in the bold and perilous undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="016213_0006_0F9BCE598D128AD8">THESE brave men were not unacquainted with the circum&s;tances of their &s;ituation, and their unprepared &s;tate for war. Not a bayonet was anvilled out, not a fire-arm manufactured, and &s;carcely a charge for a fire-arm was in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. No redoubt was ca&s;t up to &s;ecure the city, no fort was erected to re&s;i&s;t inva|&s;ion, no gun mounted on the deck of any ve&s;&s;el, and no ve&s;&s;el launched upon the &s;tream of any river.</P>
<P>THE power of Britain, on the other hand, was well known, and by the lightning of her orators, in a thou|&s;and writings and harangues, had been thrown, in full force, upon their minds. They were taught to believe her (what indeed &s;he was) old in arts and in arms, and enriched with the &s;poils of a thou&s;and victories deriv|ed from the ancient captains and the heroes of her i&s;le. Embraced by the ocean as her favourite, her commerce was exten&s;ive, and &s;he &s;ent out her &s;hips of war to every &s;ea. Her thunder was heard in the Ea&s;t-Indies and the We&s;t, and no fort or battery on the &s;hore had been proof to her a&s;&s;ault. Abounding in men, her armies were in full force, her fleets were compleatly manned, her di&s;cipline was regular, and the &s;pirit of her enterprize by &s;ea and land, had, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, in|&s;ured her &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>THE idea of re&s;i&s;tance to the power of Britain was indeed great; but the mighty &s;oul of the patriot drank it in, and, like the eagle on the &s;ummit of the moun|tain, collected magnanimity from the very pro&s;pect of the height to which he meant to &s;oar. Like the &s;teed, who &s;wallows the di&s;tant ground with his fiercene&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book of Job.</NOTE>,
<PB N="10" REF="016213_0007_0F9BCE59A0A744A8">
he attempted the career, and poured him&s;elf upon the race.</P>
<P>THE patriot quits his &s;hop, his farm, his office, and his counting-hou&s;e, and with every hope and every anxious thought prepares him&s;elf for war. The mate|rials of gun-powder are extracted from the earth; the bayonet is anvilled out; the fire arm is manufactured in the &s;hop; the manual exerci&s;e is taught; the com|pany is formed in battalion; the battalion is in&s;tructed to manoeuvre on the field; the brigade is drawn forth; and the &s;tandard of defiance is planted on the &s;oil.</P>
<P>SHALL I mention the circum&s;tances of the day when the &s;word was drawn, and the fir&s;t blood was &s;hed; and &s;hall I trace the progre&s;s of the war in the cour&s;e of five campaigns: The war of the enemy, which, like the ocean whence it came, rolled its angry waves and beat upon our coa&s;ts, now ebbing and retiring to it|&s;elf; and now &s;welling, with a refluent tide, the &s;everal bays that open to receive the rivers of America: The war of the American, which, like the bold and &s;teady winds that pa&s;s his mountains, met and tempe&s;ted the ocean, who&s;e waves were &s;een to roll, and break, and da&s;h upon the &s;hore. Or &s;hall I drop the figure, and relate, in &s;imple language, in what manner it has been fought from Canada to Georgia, and from Geor|gia to Canada; from the ocean to the mountain, and from the mountain to the ocean.</P>
<P>THE narration would require the &s;pace of an intire day: I can mention but the &s;um of things; and only tell you that the inroad of the foe has been &s;u&s;tained upon
<PB N="11" REF="016213_0008_0F9BCE5A58918D00">
the plain, and the forward and impetuous bands have been driven over the di&s;daining ground which they had mea&s;ured in advance. The hill has been defended, and the rallying and repul&s;ed, and repul&s;ed and rallying foe, has been taught to under&s;tand that the valour of Ame|rica was worthy of the cau&s;e which her freemen had e&s;pou&s;ed. The wilderne&s;s has been penetrated, and the current of the river has been &s;temmed, and the ridge of hills has been &s;urmounted in the march. The north|ern plains have been rendered ho&s;tile to the Briton, and the proud city, thought impregnable, was &s;carcely &s;afe, when, by the combined fury of the two advancing bands, &s;he was made to &s;hake beneath the &s;torm of winter and of war. The &s;outhern plains have been rendered ho&s;tile to the Briton, and the in&s;urrection has been quelled, and the i&s;land and the fort has been defended. The mid-land plains have been rendered ho&s;tile to the Bri|ton, and here it has been fought, foot to foot, and point to point, in &s;kirmi&s;hes, and night-&s;urprizes, and in pitched battles, with alternate hope, and dubious &s;ucce&s;s for many hours. The enemy, beaten in one &s;tate has retired to a &s;econd, and beaten in the &s;econd he has returned to the fir&s;t; and beaten in every &s;tate he has &s;ought the water, and like a &s;ea mon&s;ter roll|ing to his native element, the deep, has wa&s;hed his wounds in the brine of ocean: Ri&s;ing from the ocean he has &s;ought the land, and advanced with a &s;low and &s;u&s;picious &s;tep upon the ho&s;tile territory. War has again ari&s;en, and it has been fought from &s;pring to autumn, and from autumn to the &s;pring, through the heats of &s;ummer, and the inclemencies of winter, with
<PB N="12" REF="016213_0009_0F9BCE5B0EC36758">
the mo&s;t unabated ardour, and un&s;haken per&s;everance. What tract of country has not been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with the ve&s;tiges of war? What ground has not been cut with trenches? What hill has not been covered with re|doubts? What plain has not been made the &s;cene of the engagement? What &s;oil of the whole earth has not been &s;owed with ball?</P>
<P>GREAT, in the mean time, have been the labours of the &s;oldier marching to receive the enemy in every &s;tate. De&s;i&s;ting from the march for a &s;hort night, he has &s;lept without tent or covering, expo&s;|ed to &s;ummer winds and autumnal dews; or in the &s;ol&s;titial month, he has built his hut, without nail or hammer, and, on the bleak hill, has outwatched the cold &s;tars, centinels of the winter &s;ky.</P>
<P>THESE have been the toils of the heroes of our army: But tho&s;e brave &s;ouls whom we this day more parti|cularly celebrate, have added more than toils re&s;ulting from the calamities of life, even life it&s;elf. They have withdrawn from the embraces of their friends; quit|ted every fond hope of eminence in life, an idea very dear and flattering to the minds of men; they have bid farewel to the &s;un and moon, and the &s;weet changes of the varied year; they have ru&s;hed to war, and have fallen in the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>THESE of them have fallen in the long and labori|ous march, worn out with the toils of the protrac|ted and &s;evere campaign. The&s;e have fallen by the fever of the camp, amid&s;t the unavailing tears of their companions. The&s;e have fallen by the &s;low approach of wa&s;ting hunger, when, for many days, it has been
<PB N="13" REF="016213_0010_0F9BCE5BD0D89B58">
heard in the pri&s;on-&s;hip <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, "There is no bread." The&s;e of them have fallen by wounds not at once mortal. The&s;e have fallen when advancing on the enemy, they have received the bayonet in their brea&s;t; or high in hope, and anxious of victory <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thucydides.</NOTE>, they have in&s;tantly dropt, by the cannon or the mu&s;ket ball.</P>
<P>FOR what cau&s;e did the&s;e brave men &s;acrifice their lives? For that cau&s;e which, in all ages, has engaged the hopes, the wi&s;hes, and endeavours of the be&s;t men, <HI>the cau&s;e of Liberty.</HI> LIBERTY! thou art indeed va|luable; the &s;ource of all that is good and great upon the earth! For thee, the wi&s;e and the brave of every age have contended. For thee, the patriot of America has drawn his &s;word, and has fought, and has fallen.</P>
<P>WHAT was in our power we have done with regard to the bodies of the&s;e men: we have paid them mi|litary honours: we have placed them in their native earth; and it is with veneration that we yet view their tombs upon the furzy glade, or on the di&s;tant hill. A&s;k me not the names of the&s;e. The mu&s;es &s;hall tell you of them, and the bards &s;hall woo <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plato.</NOTE> them to their &s;ongs. The ver&s;e which &s;hall be &s;o happy as to embrace the name of one of the&s;e &s;hall be immortal. The names of the&s;e &s;hall be read with the names of Pelopidas, Epa|minondas, and the worthies of the world. Po&s;terity &s;hall quote them for parallels, and for example. When they mean to dre&s;s the hero with the faire&s;t prai&s;e, they &s;hall &s;ay he was gallant and di&s;tingui&s;hed in his early fall, as Warren; he was virtuous, and prudent, and intrepid, as Montgomery; he was young, and
<PB N="14" REF="016213_0011_0F9BCE5C8FFA8BB0">
faithful, and generous, as Macpher&s;on; he fell in the bold and re&s;olute advance, like Ha&s;let and like Mercer; he &s;aw the honour which his valour had ac|quired, and fainted in the arms of victory, like Har|kimer; having gallantly repul&s;ed the foe, he fell co|vered with wounds, in his old age, like Woo&s;ter.</P>
<P>The names of the&s;e brave men &s;hall be read; and the earth &s;hall be happy, where their bodies are depo|&s;ited. Happy hills of Bo&s;ton, where the God of arms gave uncommon valour to the patriot. Here the mu&s;es &s;hall ob&s;erve the night, and hymn heroic acts, and trim their lighted lamps to the dawn of morning. The little babbling My&s;tic brook, &s;hall hear the me|lody, and, &s;tealing with a &s;ilver foot, &s;hall tell it to the ocean. Happy hills within pro&s;pect of New-York, where the enemy, rejoicing in his early &s;trength, ad|ventured and fought, and where, detracting the en|gagement, he fled, with precipitation to his &s;hips: On the&s;e hills the tomb of the hero is beheld, and fancy walking round covers it with wild and romantic &s;hades. Happy grounds in the neighbourhood of Phi|ladelphia, where the foreigner &s;hall enquire the field of battle, and the citizen &s;hall &s;ay with con&s;cious pride, as if the honour was his own, this is the tomb of Wither&s;poon; that is the ground where the noble Na&s;h fell, Happy plains wa&s;hed by the A&s;hley and the Cooper, and before the walls of Charle&s;town, where the brave Lincoln now turns away the fury of the enemy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Virgil.</NOTE>: Here has the hero fallen, or rather he has ri&s;en to eternal honour, and his birth-place &s;hall be immortal. His fame, like a ve&s;tal lamp, is lighted up:
<PB N="15" REF="016213_0012_0F9BCE5E1FE4DF08">
It &s;hall burn, with the world for its temple; and the fair a&s;&s;emblies of the earth &s;hall trim it with their prai&s;e.</P>
<P>I WILL felicitate America through all her plains, and on all her bending rivers: Rivers over whom did the &s;hade of &s;ilence brood, and, rolling down, you had it not to tell of feats of valour to the li&s;tening groves. The Kennebec could not tell of an adventrous band which had &s;temmed his current, and from the cataract and the ridge of hills, had advanced beyond his &s;ource. The great St. Lawrence could not tell of naval bat|tles which had been fought upon his lakes, or of engagements near his tide; but moved &s;ilent, though maje&s;tical, along the antient Huron, and Algonquin plains. The Hud&s;on could convey no account from the heights where the valiant Gates was &s;ucce&s;sful: heights where though the tombs of the enemy are chiefly &s;een, yet becau&s;e they were brave, I will admit you to renown, and clothe you with my prai&s;es <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Longinus.</NOTE>: Even there &s;hall the foot of bards wander, and the mu&s;es &s;hall delight to dwell. The Delaware, noble river, that rolls by the&s;e walls <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Philadelphia</NOTE>, could relate of no fort de|fended on his i&s;land, or fort defended on his bank: The fort of Red-bank, where Donop, advancing, fell with three hundred of his followers, and on the eighth day, expiring with his wounds, penitentially exclaim|ed,
<Q>I fall a victim to my own ambition, and the avarice of my prince, but deeply &s;en&s;ible of the kind treatment I have received from my enemy!</Q>
For this penitential &s;igh, and the ju&s;t tribute of thy prai&s;e, O Donop, I will mix thee with the fame of heroes, and on thy memory drop a tear.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="016213_0013_0F9BCE5ECE3BF778">BUT why drop a tear? I will lift my eye to fairer pro&s;pects, the woods, and the plains, and the rivers of America. Smile, O woods! exult, O plains! and be not in&s;en&s;ible, O rivers! of the fame to which you are advanced. When, O rivers! you roll your waters to the ocean, tell her that &s;he wake not the heroes who &s;leep upon your banks; chide her, that &s;he roll her billows &s;oftly to the &s;hores. Nay, chide her not; for &s;he her&s;elf has become partial to our &s;hores: The ocean has beheld the timber cut from the mountain, the ve&s;&s;el ri&s;ing on the &s;tocks, launched upon the &s;tream, and maintaining an equal combat, on the Bri|ti&s;h &s;eas, with the &s;hip of &s;uperior force. The ocean has beheld the valour of our noble captains: when they have fallen, &s;he has embraced their bodies, and has borne them to the ri&s;ing &s;prings and the green caves concealed beneath her &s;urface. Ocean! thou did&s;t embrace the body of the gallant Weeks, the intrepid Mugford, the adventrous Campbel: Ocean! thou did&s;t embrace the body of the noble Biddle. Why &s;hould the heroes be di&s;turbed with &s;torms? Ocean! let thy flow be calm over them: Soothe them on thy coral beds, and ki&s;s them with thy waves.</P>
<P>The waves of ocean, and the native earth, &s;hall em|brace the bodies of entombed heroes; but the prai&s;e of men &s;hall embrace their fame. The prai&s;e of France &s;hall embrace the fame of the heroes of America; for having early hailed the <HI>ri&s;ing &s;tars</HI> of the&s;e &s;tates, &s;he will love tho&s;e, who on the&s;e &s;hores, fir&s;t ob&s;erved their cour&s;e. The prai&s;e of America, with reciprocal affection, &s;hall embrace the fame of France; for having early hailed the
<PB N="17" REF="016213_0014_0F9BCE5F8F206020">
virtue of her chiefs, who, with the &s;peed and the plea&s;ant breath of the vernal gales over the Atlantic wave, ru&s;hed to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he has loved them; and when they have fallen, &s;he has placed their bodies with her own heroes, and their fame in the we&s;tern heavens, that it may remain to tell to future hu&s;band|men what we owe to the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Bourbon. France! with the laurels acquired on our &s;oil, thou ha&s;t planted &s;prigs of the cypre&s;s: But let it not re|pent thee to have &s;hed thy blood in the noble cau&s;e of America. In this thou ha&s;t become <HI>Protector of the rights of mankind</HI>; and the fame of Louis XVI. is lighted up for immortality.

<P>HAVING paid that re&s;pect to the memory of the&s;e men, which the annual return of this day demanded, it remains that we &s;oothe the griefs of tho&s;e who have been deprived of a father, bereaved of a &s;on, or who have lo&s;t a brother, a hu&s;band, or a lover in the con|te&s;t. Fathers, who&s;e heroic &s;ons have offered up their lives in the debate; it is yours to recollect, that their lives were given them for the &s;ervice of their country.

the Florentine, who from the plea&s;ing relation which he writ of his voyages, &s;ub&s;equent to the di&s;covery of Columbus, was fortunate to give his name to this continent: Cabot, who coa&s;ted North-America from the bay of Mexico to the cold &s;eas, where the icy mountains roll; Raleigh, who fir&s;t hailed the native of Guiana, and the native at the mouth of the Roanoque: You, mighty &s;ouls! &s;hall behold the ri&s;ing glory of the <HI>new world,</HI> which you had di&s;covered: You &s;hall hail the independence of the States, and &s;hall read the names of tho&s;e who have a&s;&s;i&s;ted to e&s;tabli&s;h them.</P>
<P>THE names of the&s;e &s;hall be read with equal admi|ration by the early &s;ettlers of America: Men pious, and virtuous, and &s;imple in their mode of life; who hating tyranny, and loving liberty civil and religious; quitted&punc; their native i&s;land, adventured on the ocean, penetrated to the&s;e &s;hores, and cho&s;e a re&s;idence at once the boundary and the object of their emigrati|on: Men patient and laborious, who with indu&s;try cut the tree from the mountain, &s;wept the fore&s;t from the &s;oil, erected habitations, and changed the wilder|ne&s;s to fields of pa&s;ture and to cultivated vallies: A re|&s;olute and bold band of brothers, who rou&s;ed the &s;er|pent in the brake, the indian, and the wild bea&s;t, and fought again&s;t the warrior of Europe, rendered ho&s;tile becau&s;e of their connection with Britain, once fondly called the Mother-Country: An unwearied, a vigilant, a decea&s;ed, but immortal race of men, who, as hewn pillars at the bottom of the building, have &s;upported the &s;trength and dignity and riches, and gradually-ri&s;ing renown of America.

<P>SONS, who&s;e heroic fathers have early left you, and, in the conflict of the war, have mixed with departed heroes; be congratulated on the fair inheritance of fame which you are entitled to po&s;&s;e&s;s.

<P>SISTERS of the youth who has fallen in the conte&s;t with the tyrant: He was yours in his early bloom, and in his more advanced years; he was yours in the evening walk; at the morning hour; in the &s;everal hours of unclouded happine&s;s: He was yours while he could be yours con&s;i&s;tent with the will of heaven, that he &s;hould be ranked with the heroes of his coun|try. Si&s;ters! weep not the youth as the &s;i&s;ters wept Phaeton on the banks of Eridanus: He al&s;o was ad|ventrous, and mounted, a&s;piringly, a glorious car; but no foul ambition entered to his mind; and no devious error marked his way. Serene and unmoved from his cour&s;e, he illumined the tract through which he rode; and though his orb is &s;et, it is but to new-dre&s;s his beams <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Milton.</NOTE>, and to flame with fre&s;h-&s;pangled lu&s;tre in the forehead <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Milton.</NOTE> of a brighter &s;ky.</P>

<P>VIRGINS, whom in a few revolving moons the Hy|meneal chain was to bind; but the youth who had long &s;ighed for you, and thought to de&s;erve you by his valour, has ru&s;hed to the war, and has fallen in the battle: Virgins!
