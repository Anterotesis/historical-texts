<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON OUR <HI>POLITICAL</HI> and <HI>COMMERCIAL</HI> connections with FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>TO judge on the&s;e important &s;ubjects, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the peculiar &s;ituation of the United States, <HI>as connected with the European powers.</HI></P>
<P>AS a <HI>commercial</HI> country, it is our intere&s;t to form a friendly intercour&s;e with &s;uch nations as are di&s;po&s;ed to promote the great objects of trade on the principles of <HI>reciprocity.</HI> To effect this purpo&s;e, we &s;hould examine the <HI>conduct</HI> and <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of the &s;everal powers; and when con|vinced of their friend&s;hip, we ought to grant fa|vors, and confer privileges, with the &s;ame degree of liberality, as they appear inclined to act to|wards us. It is a good maxim in politics, <HI>to do to others, as they do towards us;</HI> and in order to prevent a continuance of injuries, it is incum|bent on us to check them by a vigorous and timely <HI>retaliation.</HI> By pur&s;uing a con&s;tant cour&s;e of <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> operations again&s;t &s;uch nations as wantonly endeavor to di&s;tre&s;s our trade, we &s;hall &s;peedily convince them of our increa&s;ing &s;trength, and teach them the folly of commencing a com|mercial war with us.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations being premi&s;ed, the que&s;|tion is, what nation &s;eems mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to form connections with the United States, found|ed on the broad ba&s;is of mutual advantages?
<PB N="4" REF="026015_0003_0FCFDCFF877DFFD0">
What European power holds out the mo&s;t favorable terms, to promote and enlarge our commerce? Which among them di&s;plays a gen|erous cordiality towards our <HI>government</HI> and <HI>citi|zens;</HI> or by legi&s;lative acts, &s;hows a di&s;po&s;ition to <HI>harmonize</HI> and <HI>equalize</HI> the trade and intercour&s;e of both countries? Can Americans be at a lo&s;s to announce the nation, thus di&s;po&s;ed to overtures of friend&s;hip? Among the combined powers at war again&s;t France, can one among them, with propriety receive the appellation of friends, as to their proceedings towards us? Which among them has ever come forward with commercial propo&s;itions, worthy our acceptance? Notwith|&s;tanding we have ru&s;hed precipitately into the Briti&s;h trade, and incon&s;iderately lavi&s;hed among her merchants and manufacturers, the principle part of every profitable branch of our commerce, yet we find that this nation, far from returning even decent <HI>attention</HI> to the numerous benefits they derive from the connection, treat us with the mo&s;t <HI>&s;tudied in&s;olence,</HI> and are ever planning mea&s;ures to embarra&s;s us in every port we enter. Since their conte&s;t with France, have they not pre&s;umed to prohibit our carrying the produce of America to that country, even as a <HI>neutral na|tion?</HI> Our ve&s;&s;els and property are now become the &s;port of their privateers; and the American flag, can &s;carcely be unfurled on the ocean with|out being treated by them with indecency, and expo&s;ed to in&s;ults.</P>
<P>THE <HI>coolne&s;s</HI> and <HI>indifference</HI> which many &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to &s;how towards France, are difficult to account for, as it re&s;pects both our political and
<PB N="5" REF="026015_0004_0FCFDD0184BE5B00">
commercial intere&s;t. As a young nation, is it not of the utmo&s;t importance, that we &s;ecure the <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> and <HI>confidence</HI> of France? That we do not create a <HI>jealou&s;y,</HI> and thereby excite her re|&s;entment? If &s;he appears di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, and wi&s;hes to be&s;tow every commercial benefit upon us, ought we to treat her favors with cold|ne&s;s, or appear backward in acknowledging her benevolence and partiality?</P>
<P>THERE appears a di&s;po&s;ition among <HI>&s;ome,</HI> to prefer a connection with Britain, rather than with France. It is evident that this is the aim and de&s;ign of certain individuals, <HI>however they may wi&s;h to conceal it.</HI> But no man who is a friend to, or who under&s;tands the <HI>political</HI> and <HI>commercial</HI> welfare of the&s;e &s;tates, can &s;eriou&s;ly de&s;ire it. Should Britain &s;ucceed again&s;t France, can we ever expect to reap any advantage from the acqui&s;ition? Should they re&s;tore the monar|chy, is there any one benefit to accrue to us in con&s;equence of it? Will the American com|merce thrive by the mea&s;ure, or will there be le&s;s impo&s;itions practi&s;ed on our trade? Will the Briti&s;h mini&s;try be more cordial to our welfare? Will the legi&s;lature of the nation become more favorable in their plans; or will their acts be le&s;s injurious in their operation? In &s;hort, not one advantage can we propo&s;e to our&s;elves from their &s;ucce&s;s; but on the contrary, every misfor|tune would await us. If the Briti&s;h are now &s;o in&s;olent, amid their pre&s;ent complicated di&s;tre&s;|&s;es, what may we not expect, &s;hould they effect their nefarious purpo&s;es of &s;ubjugating France? The idea is too di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to anticipate.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="026015_0005_0FCFDD02588ACA88">BUT let us rever&s;e the &s;cene, and inquire, what may we not expect, &s;hould France &s;ucceed? The friend&s;hip of this nation has ever been con&s;picu|ous. During our war with Britain, we experi|enced the &s;alutary effects of her favorable di&s;po|&s;ition. Since the peace, her exertions have not cea&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t our trade, and cement our alliance. There has ever appeared a noble genero&s;ity in all their proceedings&punc; to encourage the American connection; de&s;pi&s;ing the paltry re&s;entments that appeared to influence the Briti&s;h nation, they have treated the Americans with a liberality worthy the character of a magnanimous people. Since their conte&s;t with the European powers, they have come forward with a philanthropy and independence that mu&s;t a&s;toni&s;h their enemies, and rivet the affections of their allies. They &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to give the United States all the advantages of the war; and for that purpo&s;e have pa&s;&s;ed decrees to grant the mo&s;t ample en|couragement to our commerce in every part of their dominions. They have placed us on the broade&s;t ba&s;is of <HI>neutrality, by admitting the pro|perty of all nations to be carried in American bot|toms, free from capture.</HI></P>
<P>THE importance of the French nation, in the &s;cale of Europe, is a weighty con&s;ideration, why we ought to inculcate an harmony with them. Many per&s;ons talk of France, as they would &s;peak of Nootka-Sound, Botany-Bay, or the Miami Villages; as if it was a country <HI>ju&s;t di&s;covered,</HI> and of but little note in the political calendar. But it ri&s;es in weight and dignity when it is con&s;idered, as one of the mo&s;t power|ful,
<PB N="7" REF="026015_0006_0FCFDD0D90E4B500">
mo&s;t numerous, and mo&s;t opulent nations in Europe. Its <HI>power</HI> is immen&s;e, when we reflect on the magnitude of their pre&s;ent conte&s;t. Is there a nation that could contend for &s;o long a period with the combined powers of Europe? That could command &s;uch re&s;ources; maintain &s;uch armies; equip &s;uch navies, and defend them&s;elves without the <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> of a &s;ingle ally, again&s;t the combination of &s;uch numerous ad|ver&s;aries?&mdash;When we con&s;ider France thus <HI>&s;tand|ing alone,</HI> in this arduous and ob&s;tinate conflict, the magnanimity, re&s;olution and formidablene&s;s of the nation, &s;tand unparalleled.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;trength</HI> of the nation is inconceivable, as it re&s;pects the <HI>number</HI> of its citizens.&mdash;Is it a &s;mall matter for America to conciliate the affec|tions of twenty-&s;ix millions of people?&mdash;Shall we by our <HI>coldne&s;s</HI> and <HI>lukewarmne&s;s,</HI> hazard the advantages to be obtained from a nation &s;o re&s;pectable, as to its population?&mdash;Is it <HI>policy</HI> in us to forfeit every benefit to be acquired from an alliance &s;o reputable? Or &s;hall we overlook eve|ry flattering con&s;ideration merely to pay our de|voirs to the tottering, crumbling nation of Bri|tain?&mdash;When we reflect on the probable advan|tages that will ari&s;e to our commerce, in con&s;e|quence of retaining the friend&s;hip of France, it mu&s;t appear the highe&s;t folly not to cement our union. Should we by our pu&s;illanimous con|duct excite their jealou&s;y, or forfeit their confi|dence they might be led to retaliate with &s;ome pointed re&s;entment on our conduct; and &s;hould they pur&s;ue a &s;imilar &s;y&s;tem with Britain, we &s;hould be placed in a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="026015_0007_0FCFDD0FED8E0C60">THE <HI>re&s;ources</HI> of the French nation is another matter worthy of ob&s;ervation, and mu&s;t impre&s;s every per&s;on with an exalted idea of its power and riches. Though they &s;tand alone again&s;t the combined armies of Europe, they are enabled without any foreign loans, to rai&s;e funds &s;uffici|ent for all other purpo&s;es.&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible to con|ceive of a nation more re&s;pectable in this point of view?&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding their demands are &s;o immediate and enormous, we find they are all an&s;wered with the utmo&s;t readine&s;s, and not a murmur is heard, either in the National Con|vention, or among the people, of the burden of their taxes.&mdash;While the other powers are con|vul&s;ed for want of re&s;ources&punc; France abounds with every pecuniary &s;upply, nece&s;&s;ary for the mo&s;t exten&s;ive enterprizes. When we con&s;ider the <HI>wealth</HI> of France, in compari&s;on with their enemies, how va&s;tly &s;uperior do they ri&s;e in our e&s;timation?</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, they have already bankrupted Europe; and as for England, they have &s;haken her to the centre, without even firing a gun within her territory, merely by the <HI>echo</HI> of their cannon from the &s;hores of Holland.</P>
<P>IT is deragatory to France, to draw any com|pari&s;on between them and England: Can the latter di&s;play &s;uch an army, or equip &s;uch a na|vy, upon any emergency; more particularly, had they to contend with one quarter of the force combined again&s;t the former? On the contrary, the propo&s;ition of a loan, has &s;pread &s;uch an univer&s;al in&s;olven&s;y, throughout the Briti&s;h na|tion, as to throw a great part of her merchants
<PB N="9" REF="026015_0008_0FCFDD115BD6BD50">
and manufacturers within the &s;tatute of bank|ruptcy, and reduced her mini&s;ter to the pitiful &s;tate of an in&s;ignificant pawn-broker.</P>
<P>THESE are the ideas that ought to operate on the minds of Americans, when reflecting on our connection with France.&mdash;The pu&s;illanimity we &s;o often ob&s;erve held up in our papers, may an|&s;wer the purpo&s;es of Briti&s;h &s;ycophants, and others, who&s;e intere&s;t wholly depends on the re|venue ari&s;ing from our <HI>de&s;tructive importations</HI> from England; but the people of America, who act and rea&s;on on the grand &s;cale of public happine&s;s, cannot but view the friend&s;hip of France, as it concerns both our political and common intere&s;t, as an object of the highe&s;t magnitude.</P>
<P>FROM the foregoing ob&s;ervations, it is not meant that we &s;hould wantonly plunge our&s;elves into a war with the Briti&s;h, or become a party in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t (unle&s;s <HI>France</HI> reque&s;ts it) but thus much is meant and a&s;&s;erted, that <HI>our Nati|onal Honor</HI> demands of us to &s;upport our <HI>National Flag; protect the property of our citizens,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;s the FORTS within our own territory, which, by treaty we are entitled to&mdash;more e&s;pe|cially, when it is con&s;idered, that the "<HI>&s;trong arm of the Union,</HI>" has been exerted to quell a few tribes of Indians, and more money has been ex|pended in the&s;e di&s;graceful expeditions, than would <HI>build</HI> and <HI>equip</HI> a NAVY &s;ufficient to pro|tect our commerce, and defend our flag again&s;t every indignity.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that this ignominious Indi|an war, has ever been <HI>vindicated</HI> in tho&s;e papers
<PB N="10" REF="026015_0009_0FCFDD1334B028C0">
that are now &s;o zealous to injure the cau&s;e of France, and <HI>palliate the conduct of Britain.</HI>&mdash;Mil|lions of dollars can be expended in di&s;graceful contracts, for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troying the villa|ges of our innocent natives; but when the per|fidy and in&s;olence of Britain, is brought into view, then for&s;ooth the <HI>poverty</HI> of the &s;tates is plead, and their <HI>&s;trength</HI> is reduced to the forlorn condition of '<HI>twelve revenue cutters.</HI>'</P>
<P>TO conclude, the predilection for Briti&s;h poli|tics among many leading characters; the influence of the&s;e &s;entiments, which is every day prevailing within particular circles, together with the pro&s;|pects of numerous fictitious actions being &s;oon commenced by refugees again&s;t every &s;tate in the Union, are circum&s;tances truly alarming, and re|quire a &s;trict watch on the conduct of Britain and her &s;atellites.&mdash;Provided they can effect their purpo&s;es by <HI>per&s;onal influence; drain the trea&s;ury</HI> of every &s;tate by con&s;tant demands from TORIES,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Who are probably &s;upported in their claims by the Briti&s;h nation, to create divi&s;ions, and to refund what they have already paid to the&s;e per&s;ons.</HI></NOTE> <HI>hold our Frontiers,</HI> and <HI>di&s;affect towards us the only friendly power in Europe,</HI> the&s;e, our enemies, anticipate the period when the United States of America will become SUPPLIANTS to their cle|mency.

<HEAD>EXTRACTS FROM A SPEECH, MADE BY MAXIMILIEN ROBERTSPIERRE, IN THE NATIONAL CONVENTION, ON THE TENTH OF
<DATE>MAY, 1793</DATE>.</HEAD>
<P>MAN is born to enjoy happine&s;s and liber|ty, yet every where he is mi&s;erable and en&s;laved. Governments are in&s;tituted for the pre&s;ervation of his rights, and to perfection his faculties, yet every where governmenrs degrade and oppre&s;s him. The time is come which is to re&s;tore him to the &s;tate he was intended for; the progre&s;s of information has prepared a great revo|lution, and to you it belongs to accelerate it. To fulfil your duty in this re&s;pect, you are to prac|tice exactly the contrary of what has hitherto been done. Hitherto the art of governing has been the art of de&s;poiling and en&s;laving the ma|jority, to the advantage of a few; and legi&s;lation the art of reducing tho&s;e crimes to a regular &s;y&s;|tem. Kings, ari&s;tocrats have played their parts admirably well: to you it belongs now to do your duty, and to render men happy and free by the means of whole&s;ome laws.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="026015_0011_0FCFDD16094B3DF0">TO give to government energy &s;ufficient, that citizens may ever re&s;pect the right of their fel|low-citizens, and to prevent government from encroaching on tho&s;e rights. This is my opi|nion, the double problem that legi&s;lators have to &s;olve.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t appears to me ea&s;y; the other one might be tempted to con&s;ider as in&s;olvable, if a cur&s;ory view only is taken of pre&s;ent and pa&s;t events, without examining their cau&s;e. Read hi&s;tory and you will every where &s;ee rulers op|pre&s;&s;ing citizens; governments &s;wallowing up &s;overeignty. Tyrents &s;peaking of &s;edition, the people complain of tyranny, when the people dare to complain, which is when exce&s;&s;ive op|pre&s;&s;ion re&s;tores their energy and independence. Would heaven, they could always pre&s;erve the&s;e; but the reign of the people is of a day; that of tyrants &s;tains the hi&s;tory of ages.</P>
<P>I HAVE heard much &s;aid of the anarchy &s;ince the revolution of July 14th, 1789, and e&s;pecially &s;ince that of the 10th of Augu&s;t, 1792.&mdash;But in my opinion it is not anarchy that is the malady of the political body, but de&s;poti&s;m and ari&s;to|cracy. I am of opinion, whatever may be &s;aid to the contrary, that it is only from that apocha, which is &s;o much abu&s;ed, that we have had a beginning of laws and government, notwith|&s;tanding &s;ome di&s;turbances, which are nothing more than convul&s;ions of expiring royalty, and the la&s;t &s;truggle of a faithle&s;s government again&s;t equality.</P>
<P>POLITICAL evils never are occa&s;ioned by the people, but are cau&s;ed by the government.&mdash;
<PB N="13" REF="026015_0012_0FCFDD17AC806138">
How could it be otherwi&s;e? The people are in|tere&s;ted in the public good; the man in office has a private intere&s;t.</P>
<P>IF I choo&s;e to &s;toop to an&s;wer ab&s;urd preju|dices, I would &s;ay, that power and opulence are the parents of vice; that poverty, mediocrity and indu&s;try, are the &s;upporters of virtue; that the weak only a&s;k for the protection of mild laws; that the pa&s;&s;ions of the powerful tend to rai&s;e them above ju&s;t laws, or to produce tyran|nical laws.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT is in&s;tituted to cau&s;e the gene|ral will to be obeyed; but men who govern, have a will of their own, and every will tends to make it&s;elf obeyed. If they employ to this ef|fect the public force, with which they are armed, the government becomes a &s;courge. Agree then, that the fir&s;t object of every con&s;titution ought to be to defend public liberty again&s;t the en|croachments of the government.</P>
<P>IT is this principal object that legi&s;lators have forgotten&mdash;they have all &s;tudied to give govern|ments energy; none of them thought of bring|ing it back to its original intention. They have taken infinite precautions again&s;t in&s;urrections of the people; but have at the &s;ame time encou|raged all in their power the revolt of their dele|gates. I have already given the rea&s;on of this. Ambition, violence and perfidy, have legi&s;lated for the world. They have even en&s;laved human rea&s;on, by fir&s;t deba&s;ing it, and have rendered that rea&s;on, thus perverted, the in&s;trument of man's mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="026015_0013_0FCFDD1A226D33B0">DESPOTISM produced the corruption of man|ners; and the corruption of manners &s;upported de&s;poti&s;m. In this &s;tate of things, the conte&s;t is, who &s;hall &s;ell his &s;oul to the &s;tronge&s;t, to lega|lize inju&s;tice and deify tyranny.</P>
<P>OBSERVE even tho&s;e among legi&s;lators, whom the progre&s;s of political information appears to have impre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome principles&mdash;ob&s;erve whether they have not perverted their talents to elude them, when they cla&s;hed with their per|&s;onal intere&s;t. Ob&s;erve whether they have done any thing more than vary the forms of de&s;poti&s;m, and determine the nice &s;hades of ari&s;tocracy. They have pompou&s;ly proclaimed the &s;overeign|ty of the people, and have en&s;laved them; at the time they acknowledged magi&s;trates as the &s;er|vants of the people, they have treated them as their ma&s;ters and idols. All have agreed in &s;uppo&s;ing the people mad and factious, and public functi|onaries ab&s;olutely wi&s;e and virtuous. Without &s;eeking for examples of this among foreign na|tions, we can find &s;ome very &s;triking in the bo|&s;om of our own revolution, and even in the con|duct of the legi&s;lators, our predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>SEE with what ba&s;ene&s;s they burnt the incen&s;e of adulation, at the altar of royalty; with what impudence they preached up confidence in the public functionaries, whom they knew to be perfidious; with what violence they defamed the people; with what barbarity they abu&s;ed them. And yet &s;ee on which &s;ide the civic vir|tues weighed; the generous &s;acrifices of indi|gence; the &s;hameful averice of wealth; recol|lect the heroic conduct of the private &s;oldiers&mdash;
<PB N="15" REF="026015_0014_0FCFDD1B618A3E20">
the ba&s;e trea&s;ons of their officers; the invincible courage; the magnanimous patience of the people &mdash;the vile egoti&s;m; the odious perfidy, of &s;o many of the public functionaries.</P>
<P>BUT do not let us be &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ight of &s;o much inju&s;tice, when we con&s;ider the nation has ju&s;t emerged from a &s;tate of the deepe&s;t cor|ruption; how could a great portion of our re|pre&s;entatives be expected to &s;hew re&s;pect for hu|manity; to love equality, and believe in virtue.</P>
<P>UNFORTUNATE that we were! We were at|tempting to erect a temple to liberty, with hands yet galled with the chains of de&s;poti&s;m. What was our former education, but a continual le&s;&s;on of &s;elf-love and vanity? What were our cu&s;toms, and what we called our laws, but a code of non-&s;en&s;e and ba&s;ene&s;s, in which men were cla&s;&s;ed in a whim&s;ical gradation, and more or le&s;s de&s;pi&s;ed, according to a multiplicity of fanta&s;tical di&s;|tinctions?</P>
<P>TO de&s;pi&s;e and be de&s;pi&s;ed; to creep to the &s;eat of power; &s;laves and tyrants by turns&mdash;one moment kneeling before a ma&s;ter, the next tramp|ling under feet the people: &s;uch was our fate; &s;uch was our ambition, of almo&s;t all of us; whether well born, lawyers or financiers; whe|ther councellors, or belonging to the army. Is it to be wondered at, that &s;o many conceited merchants; &s;o many vain cits held in &s;overeign contempt the cla&s;s of arti&s;ans, when they in their turn were treated in the &s;ame manner by the no|bility? Oh what a noble pride! Oh! the won|derful education! And yet it is for this that the happine&s;s of the world is checked! For this

the bo&s;om of our country is torn by traitors! For this the &s;avage &s;atellites of the de&s;pots of Europe have de&s;troyed our crops; burnt our cities; ma&s;&s;acreed our women and children. The blood of 300 thou&s;and Frenchmen has been &s;hed, and perhaps an equal number are yet to peri&s;h; that the plain farmer &s;hould not hold a &s;eat in the &s;enate with the rich dealer in grain; that the arti&s;an &s;hould not have a vote in the a&s;|&s;emblies of the people, as well as the illu&s;trious merchant or the pre&s;uming lawyer; and that the poor, but intelligent and virtuous citizen be not allowed to appear as becomes a man in the pre&s;ence of the wealthy and profligate fool.</P>
<P>INFATUATED men, you who cry out for ma&s;|ters, that you may have no equals; do you be|lieve then that the tyrants will agree to realize the dreams of your pre&s;umptuous vanity and ba&s;e cupidity? Do you believe that the people, after having conquered for liberty, and &s;hed their blood in the defence of their country, when you repo&s;ed in the arms of indulgence and luxury, or con&s;pired again&s;t them, will &s;uffer you to en|&s;lave them? No&mdash;if you re&s;pect neither huma|nity, ju&s;tice nor honor, at lea&s;t &s;tudy your inter|e&s;t as far as it re&s;pects your trea&s;ures, which have no other enemy than the exce&s;s of human mi&s;e|ry, which you &s;o imprudently aggravate.&mdash;But what rea&s;oning can weigh with proud &s;laves? The voice of truth thundering in a depraved heart, re&s;embles tho&s;e &s;ounds which are heard in funeral vaults without awakening the dead.</P>
<P>YOU then, to whom liberty and your country is dear, undertake alone the ta&s;k of &s;aving the

public weal, and &s;ince the moment when its darke&s;t dangers appear to call for your whole at|tention, is when an attempt is made to rai&s;e the edifice of the con&s;titution with improper ha&s;te, found it at lea&s;t upon the eternal ba&s;is of truth. E&s;tabli&s;h as a fir&s;t principle, <HI>that the people are good; their delegates corruptible; that it is in the virtue and the &s;overeignty of the people that a pre|&s;ervative again&s;t the vices and de&s;poti&s;m of govern|ment is to be found.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the principle I have endeavored to e&s;ta|bli&s;h, let us now draw &s;ome con&s;equences u&s;eful in practice, which may form a &s;olid ba&s;is for a free con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE corruption of governments flows from exce&s;s of powers, and their independence of the &s;overeign: Find a remedy for this two-fold abu&s;e.</P>
<P>FIRST le&s;&s;en the influence of magi&s;trates.&mdash; Hitherto politicians, who have appeared to make &s;ome efforts, le&s;s to defend liberty, than modify tyranny, have only been able ro &s;ugge&s;t two modes of effecting this&mdash;the balance of powers, and tribunes for the people.</P>
<P>AS to the balance of powers, we may have been the dupes of that illu&s;ion, at a time when fa&s;hion appeared to require of us to give a mark of applau&s;e grateful to our neighbours, at a time when our own degradation left us to admire all foreign in&s;titutions with any thing like a &s;ha|dow of liberty to recommend them. But with little reflection, it is ea&s;y to perceive, that that balance mu&s;t be either a chimera or a &s;courge; that it &s;uppo&s;es the government a total nullity, did it not nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion a league between
<PB N="18" REF="026015_0017_0FCFDD24177708C8">
the rival powers again&s;t the people; for it mu&s;t ea&s;ily be perceived, that they will rather agree among them&s;elves, than call in the &s;overeign to judge in his own cau&s;e. Witne&s;s England, where the gold and power of the monarch al|ways inclines the &s;cale on one &s;ide, where the op|po&s;ition party appears to &s;olicit a reform in the national repre&s;entation only to retard it, in con|cert with the majority, which they &s;eem combat|ing; a &s;pecies of government mon&s;trous, where the &s;ocial virtues are only to be found in appear|ance; where the phantom of liberty excludes the reality; where law &s;anctifies de&s;poti&s;m, and the rights of the people are the objects of open traffic; where corruption is even di&s;engaged from the &s;hackles of mode&s;ty. And what are to us the contrivances that balance a tyrannic au|thority! It is tyranny it&s;elf that mu&s;t be extir|pated. It is not during the differences of their ma&s;ters only, that the people wi&s;h to breath a few moments; it is in their own &s;trength they &s;hould repo&s;e for the &s;ecurity of their rights; for the &s;ame rea&s;on I am not in favor of tribunes; hi&s;tory has not taught me to re&s;pect them.</P>
<P>I WILL tru&s;t &s;o great an intere&s;t (that of the people) with no one man&mdash;they are all weak and corruptible. Protection from tribunes, pre&s;up|po&s;es the people &s;laves. I do not like to &s;ee the Romen people retiring to the holy mount, and thence a&s;king for protectors from a de&s;potic &s;e|nate or in&s;olent patricians; I wi&s;h them to re|main in Rome, and thence to drive all tyrants. I hate as much as I hate tho&s;e patricians them|&s;elves, and I de&s;pi&s;e much more, the ambitious
<PB N="19" REF="026015_0018_0FCFDD259F90DF20">
tribunes, tho&s;e vile proxies for the people, who &s;ell to the wealthy of Rome, their &s;peeches and their &s;ilence, and who only defended their rights now and then, better to bargain when they come to barter them for gold. There is but one tri|bune of the people that I can acknowledge&mdash;the people them&s;elves; it is to each &s;ection of the French Republic, that I wi&s;h to confide the power of tribune; and it will be ea&s;y to orga|nize them in &s;uch a manner as to free them from the &s;torms of ab&s;olute democracy, and the perfi|dious calm of repre&s;entative de&s;poti&s;m. But before we think of placing barriers to protect ci|vil liberty again&s;t the overflowings of the power of magi&s;trates, let us fir&s;t define the ju&s;t limits of that power.</P>
<P>A FIRST rule to attain this end is, to fix &s;hort periods from one election to another, applying this principle in an inver&s;e ratio to the quantum of power entru&s;ted.</P>
<P N="2">2d. ESTABLISH, that no one &s;hall hold more offices than one at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P N="3">3d. THAT the powers be divided. It is bet|ter to multiply public officers, than tru&s;t to a few, a formidable power; let legi&s;lation and execu|tion be totally &s;eparated.</P>
<P>LET the various departments in the execution be entru&s;ted to different hands, and to as many hands as the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s will allow.</P>
<P>ONE of the great faults of the pre&s;ent organi|zation is, the too great extent of each of the mi|ni&s;terial departments, in which are collected va|rious branches of admini&s;tration very di&s;tinct in their nature.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="026015_0019_0FCFDD28769AC280">PUBLIC opinion ought to be the guide of men in public life, and public men &s;hould not attempt to guide or form public opinion.</P>
<P>I SHALL be a&s;ked, perhaps, how, with &s;uch &s;evere re&s;traints upon public functionaries, I can &s;ecure obedience to the laws and government? I an&s;wer, that thereby I &s;trengthen that &s;ecurity; by tho&s;e very precautions I give to the laws and government the influence I take from the vices of men who govern and make laws.</P>
<P>THE re&s;pect which a public functionary in&s;pires, depends much more upon the re&s;pect he &s;hews for the laws, than on the power he u&s;urps&mdash;and the power of the laws lies much le&s;s in the mili|tary force ready to enfore them, than on their agreeing with the principles of ju&s;tice and the general will. When the law has for ba&s;is the in|tere&s;t of the people, it will have the people for &s;upport, and its energy will re&s;t upon the energy of the whole community, of which it is the work.</P>
<P>THE general will and public force have the &s;ame origin; the public force is to the political body, what the arm is to the human body, exe|cuting what the will commands, and repelling every thing that menaces the head and heart.</P>
<P>WHEN the public force &s;econds the general will, the country is free and quiet; when they differ, the country is either en&s;laved or its tran|quillity di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>THE public force contradicts the general will in two in&s;tances; either when the law is not an expre&s;&s;ion of the general will, or when the ma|gi&s;trate employs it to violate the law. Such was the horrid anarchy that tyrants have ever e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
<PB N="21" REF="026015_0020_0FCFDD2AE161DA48">
under the name of tranquillity, good or|der, legi&s;lation and government. All their arts con&s;i&s;ts in in&s;ulating and oppre&s;&s;ing each citizen with the public force; to render them all &s;laves to their caprice, which they dignify by the name of law. Legi&s;lators enact ju&s;t laws&mdash;magi&s;|trates cau&s;e them to be punctually executed, and you will give to the world a new &s;pectacle, that of a great people, free and virtuous.</P>

<P>THE age of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy has at length arrived, and begins to illuminate the world! While that veil of darkne&s;s, which &s;pread it&s;elf over all nations, was faithfully pre&s;erved by the <HI>pious</HI> alliance of CHURCH and &s;tate, the earth wore a wretched a&s;pect, and humanity wept for the mi&s;eries of man. But when en|lightened men began to examine the cau&s;e of hu|man wretchedne&s;s, and by their efforts had pe|netrated the &s;ecret corruption of royal courts, the pillars of de&s;poti&s;m were &s;haken to the founda|tion. King-craft and prie&s;t-craft, tho&s;e mighty enemies to rea&s;on and liberty, were &s;truck with death by the genius of 1776. For &s;eventween years they have been decaying under the influ|ence of a mortal wound, and now in the la&s;t &s;tage of their exi&s;tence, like a drowning man catching at a &s;traw, one more de&s;perate effort is making to pre&s;erve them from inevitable de&s;truction. But they are &s;ummoned with a mighty voice to the dark abodes of oblivion, "to which I wi&s;h them a &s;peedy and unob&s;tructed pa&s;&s;age," never more to rai&s;e again to &s;catter mi&s;chief among de|luded nations.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="026015_0022_0FCFDD2DEE4EC450">IN this view of the &s;ubject, and con&s;idering the con&s;equences, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to admire the manly firmne&s;s which dictated the declara|tion of American Independence. Tho&s;e bold patriots de&s;erve, and will undoubtedly obtain the thanks and applau&s;e of all po&s;terity. How much is it to be lamented, that any who&s;e names we &s;ee affixed to that great in&s;trument, &s;hould at this day afford good ground of &s;u&s;picion, that their politi|cal principles are directed to the total de&s;truction of LIBERTY and EQUALITY. But the ge|nious of liberty is rou&s;ing from &s;lumber, and will eventually emancipate the world. Beware, ye American ari&s;tocrats! your principles and ef|forts are leading you to a precipice, from which the ju&s;t re&s;entment and indignation of an injured people will hurl you into eternal infamy. Civil and religious oppre&s;&s;ion will not gain much ground in the American world, though attempts are making to effectuate both. If the cau&s;e of France, which is the great cau&s;e of human na|ture, &s;hould &s;ucceed, then farewell kings, ari&s;to|crats, and the long catalogue of clerical impo&s;i|tions&mdash;impo&s;itions which have robbed man of his greate&s;t dignity, and clo&s;ed every avenue of independent reflection. Indeed, had it not been that the clergy gained a complete a&s;cendency over the minds of men, the civil oppre&s;&s;ions of the world would long &s;ince have tumbled into ruin. But living on the &s;poils of the people, it was ea&s;y for the&s;e impo&s;tors to preach up the beauty and excellency of humiliating poverty, that they them&s;elves might riot upon the luxu|ries of the earth. And thus while they degraded

the human character and fea&s;ted on the iniqui|tous profits, they aided the already too potent arm of the civil tyrant, and prepared every living creature for the complete&s;t &s;lavery.</P>
<P>HOW lamentable is it, that religion, which ought to unite all hearts, &s;hould &s;o often be made u&s;e of as a cloak for the commi&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t crimes, and by tho&s;e very men too, who have &s;o often impo&s;ed them&s;elves upon the world as per&s;ons of &s;uperior &s;anctity and virtue. I do not mean to in&s;inuate in this place that there are not virtuous and upright individuals among this body of men; but, take them as a body, they have done infinite mi&s;chief, and many of them merit the cur&s;es of the pre&s;ent and all fu|ture ages. In ju&s;tice, however, to the American clergy, it ought to be ob&s;erved, that in effecting our revolution, many of them by their precepts and example afforded great &s;ervice, and were truly valuable members of the community. I wi&s;h it could be &s;aid at this day, that none of them a&s;&s;umed the my&s;terious carriage and ima|ginary dignity of an European bi&s;hop.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In the &s;tate of Connecticut, they are thought generally to have deviated from the revolutionary principles of</HI> 1776.

pro&s;pect. The empire of rea&s;on will &s;oon &s;weep from off the earth this bundle of non&s;en&s;e and oppre&s;&s;ion, and permanently fix the attention of the human mind upon a point e&s;&s;ential to its dig|nity and happine&s;s. Already have the two re|volutions of America and France awakened in the intellectual world a new energy of thought, and turned the pur&s;uit of man upon &s;cientific principle into the path of liberal di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Previous to the&s;e great events&mdash;events unparel|leled in the hi&s;tory of ages, every pur&s;uit of man was tinctured with the de&s;poti&s;m of <HI>church</HI> and <HI>&s;tate.</HI> Scarcely a &s;ingle art or &s;cience could be independently inve&s;tigated without fear and trembling; at lea&s;t it was fir&s;t to be enquired how the proof of any propo&s;ition would affect the power and influence of tho&s;e two <HI>holy</HI> &s;i&s;ters, who &s;ubjugated the earth in perpetual bondage. The rights, dignities, and e&s;&s;ential privileges of the human race, were buried in the gulph of roy|al and clerical avarice and deception. But the&s;e days of fanatici&s;m and oppre&s;&s;ion are vani&s;hing away, and the philo&s;ophy of the human mind is making deep re&s;earches, to develope the nature of tho&s;e principles, which will afford a perma|nent hope to the wretched in every part of the world.</P>
<P>THE cries of millions of innocent &s;ufferers are calling aloud upon rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy to come forth to their aid, and lead them with a powerful hand to the land of light and joy. And it is a matter of unu&s;ual con&s;olation, that the two great events, previou&s;ly mentioned, have
<PB N="26" REF="026015_0025_0FCFDD33D9798BA0">
&s;o far contributed to &s;timulate reflecting men to inve&s;tigate the principles of nature, as leads to a hope, that a la&s;ting &s;ource of felicity may be e&s;tabli&s;hed for the great family of mankind. Not much longer &s;hall &s;uper&s;titious impo&s;tors <HI>decimate</HI> the fruits of man's indu&s;try: but the principles of government, religion, literature, and morals, &s;hall receive that candid and impar|tial di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, which the nature and importance of the &s;everal &s;ubjects require. Already great improvements have been made, and though ma|ny are in dread of innovations, yet I conceive no good ground of apprehen&s;ion has been &s;hewn on the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THE philo&s;ophy of this age, teaches the mo&s;t pure and unadulterated morality; and &s;tripping religion of its my&s;teries and external trappings, will pre&s;ent it to the view of the human mind in more beautiful and attractive charms: &s;o that in every point of view, the&s;e great political events will &s;erve to ameliorate the condition of the human race.</P>

<HEAD>ORATION, BY CITIZEN BRACKENRIDGE, On the Celebration of the Anniver&s;ary of Indepen|dence. [Pitt&s;burgh,
<DATE>July 4, 1793.</DATE>]</HEAD>
<P>THE celebration of the day, introduces the idea of the principle that gave it birth: Was it the wi&s;dom of the king of Great-Britain, who &s;aw the growing greatne&s;s of the province, that they were now of age to act for them&s;elves, and bade them be independent? No&mdash;The wi&s;|dom of the parliament of Great-Britain, that &s;eeing the inconvenience or impo&s;&s;ibility of our being repre&s;ented in the legi&s;lature, and &s;en&s;ible of the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of being bound by laws without being repre&s;ented, &s;aw the expediency of a &s;eparation from them, and &s;aid to us, Be independent and become an allied power? No&mdash; Nothing of all this. The king and parliament of Great-Britain, were of opinion, that without repre&s;entation, we were bound by their laws, and though de&s;cendants of their i&s;le, had no right to freedom in a great fore&s;t.</P>
<P>WHENCE then our independence? It was the offspring of the under&s;tanding and the virtue of the people of America them&s;elves. The elo|quent advi&s;ed; the brave fought, and we &s;uc|ceeded. The day on which we a&s;&s;umed our rights, became a fe&s;tival; and every future year &s;hall remember it with ardent exertion.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="026015_0027_0FCFDD3DDFDB7CB0">THE celebration of the day, introduces the idea of the effect of it beyond the &s;phere of the&s;e &s;tates. The light kindled here has been reflect|ed to France, and a new order of things has ari|&s;en. Shall we blame the intemperance of the exertions? Was there ever enthu&s;ia&s;m without intemperance? and was there ever a great effect without enthu&s;ia&s;m? Thy principles, O! Li|berty, are not violent or cruel: but in the de&s;pe|ration of thy efforts again&s;t tyranny, is it not al|ways po&s;&s;ible to keep within the limit of the vengeance, nece&s;&s;ary to defence? Do we accu&s;e the air, or the ba&s;tile of the mountain, when the rock is bur&s;t, and the town engulphed? The air of it&s;elf is mild, and &s;carcely wafts a feather from its place: But re&s;trained and impri&s;oned, the yielding and placid element becomes indignant, and tears the globe before it. Do we accu&s;e the hurricane, when the mariner is to&s;&s;ed with the tempe&s;t, and is an incidental &s;ufferer in the &s;torm? The naturali&s;t does not. He tells you that the equilibrium of the atmo&s;phere has been di&s;turb|ed, and if man has &s;uffered more than the de|merit of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions it is in a &s;truggle of nature to re&s;tore her&s;elf.</P>
<P>IS it the duty of the&s;e &s;tates to a&s;&s;i&s;t France? That we are bound by treaty, and how far, I will not &s;ay; becau&s;e it is not nece&s;&s;ary. We are bound by a higher principle, if our a&s;&s;i&s;tance could avail; the great law of humanity.</P>
<P>WE might, it is true, alledge the &s;tipulations of a treaty, and the <HI>guarantee of her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to France.</HI> But all the world would know, and we ought to avow it, that it is the cau&s;e of republi|cani&s;m
<PB N="29" REF="026015_0028_0FCFDD3F22882DF0">
which would induce our efforts. The tyrant of Great-Britain alledged the &s;tipulations of a treaty relative to the opening of the Schaldt and waiting for no requi&s;ition on the part of Holland to ob&s;erve the guarentee. But all the world knew, and he might have avowed it, that it was not the opening of the Scheldt, but the attack upon monarchy, that prompted his inter|po&s;ition. Shall kings combine, and &s;hall repub|lics not unite? We have united. The heart of America feels the cau&s;e of France; &s;he takes a part in all her councils; approves her wi&s;dom; blames her exce&s;&s;es; &s;he is moved, impelled, elevated and depre&s;&s;ed; with all the changes of her good and bad fortune; &s;he feels the &s;ame fu|ry in her veins; &s;he is to&s;&s;ed and &s;haken with all the variety of hopes and fears, attending her &s;ituation: Why not? Can we be indifferent? Is not our fate interlaced with hers? For, O France! if thy republic peri&s;h, where is the ho|nor due to ours? From whom re&s;pect to our flag upon the &s;eas? Not from France re&s;tored to a monarch, and indignant at the&s;e very feel|ings which are now our glory: Not from the de&s;pots that are again&s;t her: The&s;e will ea&s;ily re|collect that the cau&s;e of their evils took their ri&s;e here.</P>
<P>CAN we a&s;&s;i&s;t France by arming in her favor? I will not &s;ay that we can. But could we, and &s;hould France &s;ay, United States, your neutra|lity is not &s;ufficient; we expect the junction of your arms with mine; your heroes on the &s;oil, and your privateers on the ocean, to di&s;tre&s;s the foes; who is there would not &s;ay, It &s;hall be &s;o;
<PB N="30" REF="026015_0029_0FCFDD40A1EB3658">
you &s;hall have them; our citizens &s;hall arm; they &s;hall attack; our oaks &s;hall de&s;cend from the mountains; our ve&s;&s;els be launched upon the &s;tream, and the voice of our war, however weak, &s;hall be heard with yours!</P>
<P>IF we our our&s;elves &s;hould judge that our arms could a&s;&s;i&s;t France, even though the gener|rous republic required it not, yet who would he|&s;itate to interfere, not only at the ri&s;k of proper|ty, but life it&s;elf? Is it illu&s;ion; or do I hear France &s;ay? My daughter America! I know the dutifulne&s;s of thy heart towards me; and that thou art di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew it, by taking part in this war. But I wi&s;h thee not to provoke ho&s;tilities for my &s;ake. If I peri&s;h, I peri&s;h; but let not a mother draw in a haple&s;s child, to &s;uffer with her&s;elf: Is it illu&s;ion; or do I hear America reply? I do, and it is in the language of the Moabite&s;s Ruth, to her mother-in-law, the Jewi&s;h Naomi, "Intreat me not to leave thee, or return from following thee; for whither thou goe&s;t, I will go; and where thou lodge&s;t, I will lodge; thy people &s;hall be my people, and thy God my God; where thou die&s;t, I will die, and there will I be buried. God do &s;o to me, and more al&s;o, if aught but death &s;hall part thee and me."</P>
<P>BUT whether we a&s;&s;i&s;t or not, thy cau&s;e, O! France, will be triumphant. Did the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a &s;mall Roman people, repel their invaders, until Rome became the protectre&s;s of nations? Did the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a few Greeks, repel the millions of A&s;ia, and afterwards overrun her kingdoms? Did the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the Saracens,
<PB N="31" REF="026015_0030_0FCFDD4470E98BA0">
in a few years &s;pread to Spain on the one hand, and the Indus on the other? Did the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a few mad Cru&s;aders, bur&s;t upon the Saracen, and e&s;tabli&s;h the kingdom of Jeru&s;alem in the centre of his empire? And &s;hall the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a brave people, more numerous than the early Ro|man republic, the Greeks under Alexander; the Saracens of Arabia, or the Cru&s;aders of Europe, be &s;ubdued by all that are again&s;t them? The weight will but conden&s;e re&s;i&s;tance, and as the materials of explo&s;ion in the ordonance acquire a &s;pring by confinement, &s;o in proportion to the attack of this people, will their voice be terrible, their blow ir|re&s;i&s;table.</P>
<P>FRANCE will be independent al&s;o, and cele|brate her anniver&s;aries; and in doing &s;o will re|collect that our independence had preceded hers and made the example.&mdash;The anniver&s;ary of the independence of Amarica will be a great epocha of Liberty throughout the world. Proceed we then to celebrate the day; advance to the fe&s;tive board; pour out liberations to &s;entiments of li|berty, and let the loud mouthed artillery be heard on the hill!</P>
