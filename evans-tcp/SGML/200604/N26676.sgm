<HEAD>APOLOGY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader is requested to note the following facts, and to make his own deductions from them, with all the candor with which he is possessed.</P>
<P>HE will recollect that the subjoined performance, was undertaken only a fortnight previous to the day upon which it was delivered&mdash;that, of this short interval, the Author was obliged to be absent more than a week, on a journey to Boston, and, that much of the remaining part of his time was taken up in his business, which at that period peculiarly demanded his attention.</P>
<P>SUCH were the circumstances which attended the writing of the following Oration&mdash;and such the facts that plead emphatically for the candor and benevolence of the reader.</P>
<P>As it was written with reluctance, though at the request of the Mi|litia officers and a number of other respectable Citizens of this town, so with diffidence are their wishes complied with, in submitting to them a copy for publication.</P>

<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>UPON ordinary occasions, where the Speaker is to address a variety of characters, to the greater part of whom, perhaps, he is unknown&mdash;where many listen, but to criticise, and criticise, but to condemn, it might not be unnecessary for him to solicit the candour of his audi|ence, by a long exordium.</P>
<P>BUT, upon an occasion like the present&mdash;the anniversary of a day which has given birth to an extensive empire, and secured the freedom, happiness, and independence of mil|lions of inhabitants&mdash;when every heart is dilated with joy, and every feeling tuned to delight; it might discover a want of charity to doubt your candour, and a want of confidence to suspect your generosity.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of detaining you then, my Friends and Fel|low Citizens, by making any apology for my want of ei|ther time or ability to do justice to the occasion, that now animates every American bosom, I shall offer a few observations that naturally arise, when contemplating so vast and glorious an event, as that which we are now cele|brating&mdash;an event, which has at once arrested the progress of tyranny and usurpation&mdash;humbled a haughty and impe|rious power, and placed America in a conspicuous and ex|alted station among the nations of the earth.</P>
<P>SUCH is the event, that has distinguished this day above every other, and consecrated it a JUBILEE throughout con|federated America.</P>
<P>NOT, like the poor, deluded <HI>Sansculottes</HI> of degenerated France, are we assembled to mock heaven by our mirth&mdash;not like them, are we come together, to chaunt Paeans to a few unprincipled demagogues, each of whose little finger
<PB N="6" REF="035485_0005_1004DC9F4952AC48">
is thicker, and heavier laden with oppression, than the loins of their good king, whom they have cruelly murdered&mdash;not like them, are we keeping a festival, instituted by the nation, to perpetuate the most savage barbarities&mdash;the butcheries and assassinations of the greatest and wisest cha|racters of our country:&mdash;But like rational and sober citi|zens, who know how justly to estimate their privileges, and who feel grateful for the blessings they enjoy, we have now turned aside from our ordinary labours to do homage to liberty, in her real character; and to confirm our allegiance to a government, planned by wisdom, and administered by virtue, talents and integrity.</P>
<P>THAT man was formed for society, is a truth deeply impressed upon every heart. Such is the imbecility of his nature, and such the variety of wants with which he is surrounded, that without the aid of his fellow creatures, existence would soon become insupportable.</P>
<P>FROM a commerce of benefits, it is, says Seneca, that life is rendered easy and pleasant, and, hence it is, we are enabled to defend ourselves against any sudden insult or at|tack. Nature, which has denied to man that strength, and those weapons of defence, with which she has supplied other animals, has liberally compensated for her parsimony in this respect, by endowing him with reason and sociabil|ity, whereby he, who alone, could make no resistance, becomes master of the whole. It is this same union which supplies him with remedies in his diseases, assistance in his old age, and comfort in his pains and anxieties&mdash;it is this, which enables him, as it were, to bid defiance to the frowns of fortune. Abolish society, and the union of mankind is destroyed and human happiness annihilated.</P>
<P>SOCIETY being necessary for the welfare and happiness of man; so government and subordination are necessary for the preservation and well being of society. This is a truth sufficiently attested by the experience and practice of every preceding age, from the earliest period of the world down to the present day. Such is the diversity of tastes, dispositions, and talents, of which man is possessed&mdash;so strong is his propensity to deviate from the strict rules of rectitude and virtue; and so powerful is that love of self,
<PB N="7" REF="035485_0006_1004DCA0F85C3130">
which is implanted in every bosom, and which too often inclines its possessor to seek his own interest, though in op|position to the good of the whole; that, without some social compact, formed for the general welfare, without sacrifi|cing to the community some of the less rights and privi|leges, that those which are of more importance may be enjoyed with the greater freedom and security, mankind would soon become a heterogeneous mass, fluctuating in their principles and conduct just as their caprice, their inte|rest, or their passions might chance to dictate.</P>
<P>THAT "all men are born free and equal," is a maxim more frequently repeated than understood&mdash;a maxim well calculated to tickle the ears of the populace, and to gain proselytes to the modern schemes of innovation in Religion and Politics. Though in a limited point of view, "Liber|ty and Equality" may justly be considered as the natural in|heritance of all men; yet when made use of without any qualification or restriction&mdash;when perverted to the vilest purposes&mdash;to the subversion of all Government, order and happiness, then it is they become the inheritance of none but fools or madmen.</P>
<P>THERE are certain rules prescribed by Heaven, against which, no one, though in a state of nature, has the liberty of infringing; and Nature has, in no instance, distributed her favors with so equal a hand as to place all upon a per|fect level. To some she has given five talents, to some two, and to others but one. It is absurd then to suppose, that, by Liberty, is meant the privilege for every one to do that which is right in his own eyes, though it should operate to the detriment and hurt of others; or that by equality, should be understood, that all have an equal right and equal ability to hold the balance of justice, or to wield the scep|tre of Government.</P>
<P>THOSE facinating sounds then, which of late, "have set the whole world in an uproar," and, by which most of the Governments of Europe are in danger of being annihilat|ed&mdash;The magic of whose sound, has raised many an igno|rant and unprincipled wretch from the kennels of France, to bask in the sunshine of power, or to fatten on the spoils of those innocent victims, whom they have inhumanly sa|crificed
<PB N="8" REF="035485_0007_1004DCA313E790D8">
to their capacity, can mean, in reality, nothing more than the liberty which all naturally possess, of exercising their own reason, and following the dictates of their con|sciences, so long as they are careful not to invade the rights of others&mdash;of choosing their own form of Govern|ment; and of possessing an equal claim to its protection, and an equal right (so far as their merit is equal) either by themselves or their representatives to a share in its admin|istration.</P>
<P>BUT, as every thing of human invention, is stamped with imperfection, so a perfect form of Government can never be expected. That Government, which then approaches the nearest to perfection&mdash;which is the best calculated to secure its citizens in the enjoyment of their persons and properties, rights and privileges&mdash;which holds out the greatest encouragement for virtue and talents, and impos|es the severest checks upon vice and irregularity, is to be preferred above every other, and no doubt will be main|tained, though a host of modern Philosophers and French disorganizers should wear out their longs in declaring a|gainst it.</P>
<P>THAT the American Government embraces every possi|ble object for the benefit of the people, is proclaimed to us in the most emphatical language. As "every tree is known by its fruit," so the wisdom and excellence of our Federal Constitution is seen, both in the general prosperity of the Nation, and in the security and happiness of individuals&mdash;in the vast influx of respectable foreigners, who have fled from the galling yoke of oppression in other countries, and in the rapid increases of its natural citizens&mdash;in the encouragement that is given both to the liberal and me|chanic arts, and in the scrupulous care that is manifested to guarantee to the citizens the liberty of conscience, of speech and of the press, so essential to the security of free|dom.</P>
<P>BUT, that we may taste the blessings that surround us with a keener relish and feel more forcibly the obligations we are under of publicly testifying our gratitude for the many great and signal advantages we have derived from our emancipation from British tyranny, and the establish|ment
<PB N="9" REF="035485_0008_1004DCA7E422A7F8">
of American Independence, let us cast our eyes across the Atlantic, and see to what a wretched and deplora|ble situation some of the nations of Europe are reduced.</P>
<P>BEHOLD Holland, that once commercial and flourishing Republic, by the industry of whole citizens almost a mira|cle was wrought, in converting "the sea into dry land"&mdash;behold is now <HI>squeezed</HI> almost to suffocation by the <HI>loving embraces</HI> and "fraternal hugs" of their <HI>generous protec|tors</HI> the French! See their Commerce annihilated&mdash;their Cities depopulated&mdash;their Government abolished&mdash;their Arts neglected and their Country inundated. Not only is a part of it literally overwhelmed by the waters busting through their long-neglected dikes, which labor and indus|try had raised to oppose and keep out this destructive ele|ment;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is well known that a great portion of the territory of the united Ne|therlands, is what the inhabitants have gained from the sea by means of dikes, which they have raised, and, for many years, supported at vast la|bour and expence. These, like all their public works, having been wholly neglected since the country has been overrun and impoverished by the French, have at length become so much out of repair, as in ma|ny places, to give away and let the water in upon the inhabitants to the destruction of much property, a number of towns and villages, and ma|ny of their lives.</NOTE> but by hordes of French soldiers and French task|masters, who like the locusts of Egypt, have "darkened all the land, and devoured every green thing, and all the fruit" that had been accumulated by the toil and hard labor of many preceding years.</P>
<P>VIEW Imperial Hamburgh, the only monument of the <HI>sparing mercy</HI> of the "generous Nation," servilely coun|ting out its wealth to purchase an exemption from French fraternity and benevolence!</P>
<P>BEHOLD Spain crouching to the <HI>five headed monster</HI> and meanly eyeing its hand in all her operations, lest she should incur its hot displeasure, and be subjugated to its galling yoke! Behold also her subjects groaning under the oppres|sion of their own Government, and impoverished by its ex|actions.</P>
<P>SEE Germany and Switzerland devastated&mdash;the Kings of Naples and Sardinia driven from their territories, while their subjects, whom they could no longer protect, are
<PB N="10" REF="035485_0009_1004DCA969CEB688">
butchered &amp; plundered. See all the states of Italy revolution|ized, &amp; Rome its capital, the once famed mistress of the world, humbled &amp; debased: To complete the horrid picture; turn your eyes to <HI>regenerated</HI> France, the nursery of every crime, and the author of the most of these evils that now agitate the world: Behold a people boasting of their emancipation from slavery, and proclaiming to the world the sweets of liberty, while a few unprincipled and ambitious wretches are riding upon their necks and subjecting them to the worst of tyranny. The most unjust and oppressive mea|sure is adopted and made to go down with the multitude, barely by prefacing it with this apology&mdash;"imperious cir|cumstances require it, and the Directory wills it."</P>
<P>VIEW their military conscriptions, which are arbitrarily enforced to fill up the deserted and broken columns of their armies! Behold sons, husbands and fathers, inhumanly torn from their homes, their families and friends, to do <HI>journey|work</HI> for the "King of Terrors"&mdash;compelled to wear out their lives in acquiring new conquests for the aggrandize|ment of those in power! Look into their Military Tribu|nals and Courts of Justice, and see what bribery and cor|ruption is daily practiced there! See the lives and proper|ty of the citizens converted into sources of speculation by those who are bound to protect them in the enjoyment of their rights! Listen to the declaimers in their National Assemblies, and hear the blasphemies that are there utter|ed against, not only every Government that has not been revolutionized by the force of their arms, or the influ|ence of their "diplomatic skill;" but against all religion and morality, which are the foundation and support of ci|vil society.</P>
<P>AND, the more thoroughly to effect their pernicious schemes, see them abolishing the Sabbath, that day of rest, which all are commanded to keep holy; and boldly, and impiously declaring to the world that they will not have, even a God, to reign over them!</P>
<P>SUCH is the wretched picture which an imperfect sur|vey of some of the nations of Europe has exhibited, and such the character of that people, who are practising eve|ry art, and straining every nerve, to add this country to the number of their conquests.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="035485_0010_1004DCAC09E0BB78">
AND shall Americans&mdash;"the sons of Liberty" tamely bow their necks to a foreign yoke? shall they, like Esau, barter away their <HI>birth right for a mess of portage?</HI> or, like the unsuspecting lamb, servilely "lick the hand that's raised to shed its blood?"</P>
<P>BECAUSE from selfish motives&mdash;for the sake of weaken|ing and dismembering a rival power, France once conde|scended to assist us, must the stock of our gratitude never be exhausted? Must we passively sit still and see our pro|perty piratically taken from us&mdash;our commerce interrupt|ed&mdash;our citizens plundered, abused and imprisoned; and the whole nation insulted in the persons of our late En|voys, and the chief Magistrate of the union?</P>
<P>FORBID it Honour&mdash;forbid it Justice&mdash;forbid it the Shades of all those worthy Heroes, who gave their lives as the purchase of our Liberty and Independence.</P>
<P>As France was friendly, we loved her&mdash;As she was gen|erous, we rewarded her;&mdash;but as she is treacherous, let us spurn her from our bosoms as a viper, that is endeavour|ing to insinuate her poison throughout our whole political and moral system.</P>
<P>HAVE we not heard her proclaim to the world that we are a divided people? Have we not heard her boast her "diplomatic skill" to sever us from the government of our choice, which concentres in it all the wisdom and experi|ence of ages? Have we not heard her threaten to ravage our coasts, and plunder and burn our sea ports from Georgia to Newhampshire, should we offer to vindicate our rights, or lift a hand against the "terrible Republic." Have not our ears been insulted by a demand of tribute for the pur|pose of assisting them to carry on their wicked and ambi|tious schemes, together with a "small Douceur for the pockets of the Directory?"</P>
<P>ALL this our ears have heard&mdash;All this our eyes have be|held! Where then is the spirit of '75, which blazed forth with such universal ardour, when Britain sought to "drag|goon" us into slavery? Where is that love of freedom, which induced the DECLARATION of INDEPENDENCE, when our country was young and inexperienced, both in the art of Government and of War? At a time too, when
<PB N="12" REF="035485_0011_1004DCAEC618B310">
she was destitute of resources, and when a powerful, vete|ran army, stood ready with unsheathed swords, to glut its rage upon those who should dare oppose the measures of the then mother country? Was not this the language, which, at that time, was echoed through every village and hamlet in the United States&mdash;"it is better to die freemen, than to live slaves."</P>
<P>AND have Americans soon become surfeited with the po|litical blessing that Heaven has so liberally showered up|on them? Has the short term of three and twenty years, given them an aversion to freedom, and made them weary of the task of governing themselves, that they would now confide this sacred privilege to the hands of foreigners and strangers?</P>
<P>THANK Heaven the situation of our country has not yet become so desperate! Thank Heaven the American Character has not yet sunk to so low a pitch of infamy and degradation: No&mdash;The same sacred and God-like spirit, which glowed in the bosoms of our Ancestors, and inspir|ed them with the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of flying from the persecutions of King James to this then inhospitable clime, and the same attachment to Liberty and Independence, which impelled their descendants to resist the arbitrary measures of George the III when his Parliament arrogated to itself the "right <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> the colonies in all cases whatsoever," still warms the heart and actuates the conduct of every real American.</P>
<P>THE long suffering of our Country being exhausted in consequence of repeated insults, and accumulated aggres|sions&mdash;her patience having been construed into weakness and her generosity into cowardice, she has at length assum|ed an attitude, which is applauded by the world, and which has given a tone to the wavering and doubtful councils of some of the Cabinets of Europe. After frequent and vain attempts at Negociation, for an accommodation of our difficulties&mdash;after seeing the proffered Olive branch repeatedly rejected, and rejected too with scorn and con|tempt, she has stretched forth her arm, and in a dignified and decisive tone, has declared to her once acknowledged sister &amp; ally, that, "thus far shall thou go <HI>in thy piracies,</HI> &amp; no
<PB N="13" REF="035485_0012_1004DCB275F819E0">
further, and here shall thy <HI>insults</HI> and thy <HI>perfidy</HI> be stay|ed"</P>
<P>INSTEAD of paying the tribute that has been insolently demanded in the current coin of France&mdash;<ABBR>viz.</ABBR>&mdash;Specious promises, Dutch Rescripts, or French Assignats; our Government, with the promtitude of an honest and an a|ble D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">b or, has wisely determined to make the disburse|ment in a more weighty and powerful MEDIUM, COINED FOR THE PURPOSE IN THE FOUNDARIES OF THE UNI|TED STATES; a specimen of which has not long since, been forwarded to them by the hands of the gallant TRUXTON, who has returned to his country with ample testimonials of his having faithfully executed his mission, by bringing with him the avouchers of <HI>its</HI> reception, written in <HI>French Blood</HI> Such alone is the tribute which Americans will condescend to pay as the purchase money of this national Independence&mdash;such is the tribute with which a WASHINGTON will welcome those to our shores whom the Directory may appoint to come forward with the demand.</P>
<P>WHO is there among us then, who knows the origin of our nation? who is there acquainted with the wisdom and excellence of our federal constitution? who is there that has experienced the benefit and protection of our laws, who does not rejoice that he is an American? Who is there that does not feel his heart warmed with gratitude and benevolence, at the return of this natal day of our political happiness? Who is there possessed of such a con|tracted disposition, who would grudgingly cast his <HI>mite</HI> in|to the treasury of his country, whenever the exigencies of the nation require pecuniary contributions? Who is there that would reluctantly come forward to support so good a government, or to defend so happy a land.</P>
<P>ALAS! with pain we are compelled to acknowledge that the American soil has produced some worthless characters, whose conduct has merited the odium and contempt of ev|ery lover of his country.</P>
<P>As venomous insects and noxious weeds are warmed into
<PB N="14" REF="035485_0013_1004DCB5197BAA98">
being by the vivifying rays of the sun, so a number of unprincipled and detestable paracides, have been nourished into life, by the mild influence of the American govern|ment.</P>
<P>THESE are they, who are found "standing in the mar|ket places, and in the corners of streets" preaching up French politics, and French perfidy; and declaiming a|gainst every wise and efficient measure that has been adopted by Congress for national defence. These are they, who, not long since, kindled the flame of sedition and erected the standard of rebellion in some of the wes|tern counties of Pennsylvania. These are they who voted the late inflammatory and disgraceful resolutions of Ken|tucky and Virginia, for the purpose of alienating the affec|tions of the people, from the federal government. These are they who leave no art&mdash;no measure unattempted to stir up a tempest sufficiently powerful to overwhelm the na|tion, that they may have an opportunity to enrich them|selves upon the plunder of the wreck.</P>
<P>BUT from such characters American citizens have but little to apprehend, so song as the channels of information are kept open in every corner of the United States, and the people are attentive to their elections: especially since the guardianship and protection of our country, more particularly upon all sudden emergencies, is wisely confi|ded to a national militia, formed from the great body of its enlightened and most respectable citizens.</P>
<P>To you then, Fellow Citizens, in arms, and to your worthy brethren, your country will turn her anxious eyes whenever her rights or her territories are invaded. To you is committed the ark of her political safety, and upon your voice depends either the destruction or the salvation of your country. May you duly consider the importance of the trust confided to your care, and cheerfully rally a|round your government whenever its safety shall be en|dangered, either by foreign foes or domestic traitors. And from the same pure and ethereal spirit of patriotism, which has hitherto distinguished our nation, may we all be indu|ced,
<PB N="15" REF="035485_0014_1004DCB6A21140A0">
in the language of a much celebrated, modern song, to lift up our hands to heaven, and swear,
<Q><L><HI>That ne'er shall the sons of Columbia be slaves,</HI></L>
<L><HI>While the earth bears a plant or the sea roll's its waves.</HI></L></Q></P>
