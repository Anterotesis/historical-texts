<HEAD><HI>EUGENIUS</HI> AND <HI>SELIMA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A GENTLEMAN of fortune in this metropolis, (whom it will not be improper to di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of Moro&s;us) &s;ent his only &s;on, Euge|nius, to the Univer&s;ity;&mdash;there to fini&s;h his &s;tudies under the care of a tutor.</P>
<P>The fortune and engaging carriage of this young gentleman rendered him an agreeable gue&s;t to all the polite &amp; gay a&s;&s;emblies of the place, &amp; his &s;pright|line&s;s and vivacity a welcome vi&s;itor of the hou&s;es of the more private per&s;ons of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Being one night at a card party at Mrs. R&mdash;'s, he was introduced to Mrs. C&mdash;, and her beautiful daughter Selima. Eugenius was &s;truck at fir&s;t &s;ight with the charms of this young lady, and felt a plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation in contemplating her perfections. Mrs. R&mdash;, ob&s;erving his embarra&s;&s;ment, took him by the hand, and pre&s;ented him to the lady and her daughter. "I introduce to you," &s;aid &s;he, ad|dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to the latter, "a young gentleman who has long wi&s;hed for the plea&s;ure of being in your company." "Madam," &s;aid he, bowing and emboldened by what Mrs. R&mdash; had &s;aid, "'tis not alone to be in your company that I de&s;ire; I beg leave to be permitted to increa&s;e the number of your admirers." He now pau&s;ed, but perceiv|ing the ladies had left them together, he was re&s;um|ing his di&s;cour&s;e, when &s;he interrupted him. "You confound me, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "as I am &s;en&s;ible I am unworthy &s;uch flattering compliments." Here Mrs. R&mdash; and her friend entered, and the di&s;|cour&s;e turning on different &s;ubjects, till the compa|ny encrea&s;ed, they &s;at down to cards, leaving Euge|nius ab&s;orbed in thought.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="033700_0003_0FF8FB24A299BE08" MS="y">Love now began to make powerful inroads in his heart, Selima &s;at oppo&s;ite him during the evening, and the more he beheld her the more his pa&s;&s;ion augmentened; but he feared his addre&s;&s;es were fruitle&s;s, as &s;he did not once deign him a tender look. Love, however, had, in reality made as powerful and rapid a progre&s;s in her heart as in his, though mode&s;ty taught her to di&s;gui&s;e it.</P>
<P>The evening pa&s;&s;ed principally at cards&mdash;Euge|nius indeed found nothing to cro&s;s his de&s;ires, yet it is con&s;equent to love to be attended with inqui|etude;&mdash;he longed for another opportunity of &s;peak|ing to her; but at that time it was impracticable, as &s;he and her mother withdrew at a very early hour. Before he departed, he paid his compliments to Mrs. R&mdash;, who a&s;ked him how he had liked his evening's entertainment. He replied, he was perfectly happy in the &s;ociety of &s;uch agreeable per&s;ons, and hoped for the renewing of that plea|&s;ure the next evening.</P>
<P>Eugenius waited with impatience the expected moment which &s;hould again bring him into the pre&s;ence of the dear object of his affections, in which interview he re&s;olved to come to an expla|nation;&mdash;but imagine his di&s;appointment when the time arrived, and he was informed, indi&s;po&s;ition prevented, her mother, and which nece&s;&s;arily hin|dered her being there. His conjecture was imme|diately, that it was merely an excu&s;e, and their ab|&s;ence was purpo&s;ely calculated to deter his further pur&s;uit. The idea was &s;ufficient to make him un|happy, and he now began to ruminate upon the ab|&s;urdity of his mi&s;take in having regarded the di&s;|tant re&s;pect &s;he had &s;hewn him, as a mark of affec|tion, which was, he now thought in reality only the &s;imple effects of politene&s;s. He left Mrs. R&mdash;'s that evening with le&s;s &s;atisfaction, as may natu|rally
<PB N="4" REF="033700_0004_0FF8FB189FDB5988">
be &s;uppo&s;ed, than he had done the proceeding.</P>
<P>After having pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;tle&s;s night, next morn|ing he paid a vi&s;it to Mrs. R&mdash;: that lady right|ly judged the cau&s;e to which &s;he was indebted for the honour of this his early vi&s;it, and to remove his &s;u&s;picions, a&s;&s;ured him he had been deprived of Mrs. C&mdash; and her daughter's company, &s;olely by the indi&s;po&s;ition of the former. Luckily, during their conver&s;ation, the ladies entered. After they had paid their congratulations to Mrs. C&mdash;, on her re&s;toration to health, and other u&s;ual compli|ments had pa&s;&s;ed, Mrs. R&mdash; took the mother by the hand and withdrew into another room in order to give Eugenius an opportunity of di&s;covering his &s;entiments to Selima: nor did he fail of making u&s;e of the pre&s;ent advantageous moment. "Madam," &s;aid he, taking her tenderly by the hand, "this is the fir&s;t time I have had the plea&s;ure of being alone with you; permit me, now I enjoy that opportuni|ty, to inform you the impre&s;&s;ion your charms made on me the fir&s;t time I had the honour of &s;eeing you, and believe me, my dear Selima, that if ever pa&s;|&s;ion was fervent and true, mine is &s;o;&mdash;and, knew you the unhappine&s;s I endured the &s;hort time I was deprived of your company, it would be &s;ufficient to give you a clear proof of the truth of what I have &s;aid, and of the &s;incerity of my affection.&mdash; Such, my dear Selima is the declimation of my heart; I &s;corn deceit;&mdash;&s;peak then, my lovely girl, determine with a &s;mile, my happine&s;s; or fix with a frown my eternal mi&s;ery." "Ah &s;ir," returned &s;he, "could I think what you have &s;aid to be true, and that it is I who have cau&s;ed the tender unhap|pine&s;s in you, you fain would have me believe; I &s;hould reflect on it with plea&s;ure; but &s;hould I li&s;|ten to your pur&s;ua&s;ive words, I fear I &s;hould be drawn to imbibe a tenderne&s;s which might hereaf|ter
<PB N="5" REF="033700_0005_0FF8FB37378AC3E8">
prove difficult to bani&s;h. Yet this, in ju&s;tice I mu&s;t &s;ay, among the fine &s;peeches I have had &s;aid to me on this &s;ubject, yours &s;eem to wear mo&s;t the ap|pearance of &s;imple &s;incerity. I &s;hould hope, &s;ir, that what I have already &s;aid, will be &s;ufficient to make known to you my &s;entiments on what you have ju&s;t now &s;aid."</P>
<P>The happine&s;s which the&s;e few words of Selima conferred on Eugenius, can only be conceived by tho&s;e who have been in a &s;imilar &s;ituation. But her mother and Mrs. R&mdash;, now entering, no fur|ther di&s;cour&s;e pa&s;&s;ed. It may be &s;uppo&s;ed he was ea&s;ily prevailed on to &s;tay dinner; and in the evening more company coming, they &s;at down to quadrille. He had again an opportunity of conver&s;ing with Selima, &s;he having declined playing. "Is it po&s;|&s;ible, Selima," &s;aid he, "that &s;uch a re&s;erved in|difference &s;hould be thought a recompence worthy the love you mu&s;t be convinced I entertain for you. I fear &s;ome more happy rival occa&s;ions this behav|iour to me; be engenious and ea&s;y my troubled &s;oul, for it were death to continue in that torment|ing &s;ituation, which your treatment has reduced me." "You are mi&s;taken, &s;ir, I a&s;&s;ure you," replied &s;he, "and in&s;en&s;ible of the feelings my heart but too freely indulges in your behalf;&mdash;your behaviour charms me, and I confe&s;s, what mode&s;ty ought to have obliged me to conceal, that your tenderne&s;s has affected me much; but whil&s;t you are thus earne&s;t|ly &s;oliciting to know what my &s;entiments are to|wards you; permit me to require you to return me the &s;incere&s;t proof of your regard by endeavouring to make your parent &amp; mine approve of it, and then you will find I &s;hall not be aver&s;e to your wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>She uttered this with the mo&s;t enchanting &s;weet|ne&s;s and innocent &s;implicity. He promi&s;ed to ac|quaint his father immediately; and they &s;pent the
<PB N="6" REF="033700_0006_0FF8C23B34B47268">
remainder of the evening in a&s;&s;uring each other of a mutual tenderne&s;s and affection; and when the company &s;eparated, he departed perfectly &s;atisfied with the a&s;&s;urances &s;he had given him of her love, and not doubting but his father would con&s;ent to their union, as he could have no rea&s;onable objec|tions to her per&s;on, nor to her fortune, &s;ince it was equal if not &s;uperior to his own.</P>
<P>The vi&s;ible happine&s;s in his countenance was quickly perceived by his tutor, who enquired the rea&s;on. Eugenius thinking he might be of &s;ervice to him in interceding with his father did not he&s;itate to tell him the cau&s;e, nor did he conceal in the lea&s;t the purport of his la&s;t conver&s;ation with Selima. "Sir," &s;aid his tutor, "you have, I fear, engaged in an affair that will be the cau&s;e of la&s;ting unhap|pine&s;s to you, and that amiable young lady. Not that love it&s;elf is to be condemned; no! far from it; it is the &s;ure&s;t mark of a great and noble &s;oul; but you &s;hould not indulge your&s;elf in it too precipi|tately&mdash;for, continued he, no one can tell but that your father may have fixed on a lady for your wife, and, neverthele&s;s whatever we may think, parents know, or at lea&s;t ought to know better what is to the advantage of their children, than they them&s;elves. Your father gave me particular orders not to &s;uffer you to make any engagement without his know|ledge; and &s;hould I fulfil my tru&s;t, did I not give him the earlie&s;t account of this tran&s;action? which, excu&s;e me if I &s;ay I know it will be contrary to his inclination."</P>
<P>His tutor was right, and when he found all his advice was to no purpo&s;e, he de&s;i&s;ted, and immedi|ately wrote to Moro&s;us, to acquaint him of the con|nection his &s;on had formed; advi&s;ing to &s;end for him home, ab&s;ence might cure him of this pa&s;&s;ion, and re&s;tore him to his &s;ences.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="033700_0007_0FF8FB47993DAF68">In a few days Eugenius received a letter from his father, containing an order to return home; this was &s;ufficient to render him unhappy; the idea of leaving Selima was death; but his father's com|mands were ab&s;olute, and mu&s;t be obeyed. The &s;ame evening he went to take his farewell of his be|loved Selima; they parted with tears, after having &s;worn fidelity to each other. Mrs. R&mdash; &s;ympa|thi&s;ed in their unhappine&s;s, by giving them all the con&s;olation friendly advice could afford. Eugenius begged her to permit him to write to her from Lon|don, to acknowledge the obligations he had already experienced; of which he &s;hould always retain the mo&s;t lively &s;en&s;e of gratitude. She readily granted his reque&s;t, and it was a con&s;olation to him that by this means he could enjoy the plea&s;ure of hearing &s;ome news of his dear Selima.</P>
<P>When Eugenius arrived in London, his father's cool behaviour hurt him not a little. The morning after his arrival, his father &s;ent for him into his clo&s;et; he obeyed his command and went trembling, but fully re&s;olved to di&s;cover his &s;entiments. On his entrance, Moro&s;us addre&s;&s;ed him thus: "Sir," &s;aid he, "pray how have you employed your time &s;ince you left home." The youth in&s;tantly, and without any re&s;erve confe&s;&s;ed his love for Selima, and in the tendere&s;t expre&s;&s;ions and per&s;ua&s;ive elo|quence exaggerated her merit and beauty&mdash;nor did he forget to mention her ample fortune, be&s;eeching him at the &s;ame time not to di&s;approve his pa&s;&s;ion by a denial of their union. "I am &s;urpri&s;ed, (re|plied the father) you &s;hould have formed &s;uch an at|tachment without my con&s;ent, and more &s;o at your boldne&s;s in avowing it. But, young man, continu|ed he, remember, I command you to think no more of this ridiculous pa&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s you would incur my utter di&s;plea&s;ure, and oblige me to a &s;everity I
<PB N="8" REF="033700_0008_0FF8FB57C9BA5370">
willingly would avoid." In vain he remon&s;trated he had plighted his honor in the mo&s;t &s;acred oaths to marry her. Moro&s;us broke from him, and would hear no more.</P>
<P>His tutor, who was acce&s;&s;ary to what had pa&s;&s;ed, came to give him all the comfort in his power, but he was incapable of receiving any.&mdash;He abandoned him&s;elf to di&s;pair, &amp; would &s;carcely receive nouri&s;h|ment for &s;everal days; nor could all the remon&s;tran|ces of his tutor bring him out of his chamber.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t opportunity he could take, without be|ing ob&s;erved, he wrote to Mrs. R&mdash;, informing her how aver&s;e his father was to his marriage and begging her to acquaint Selima of his eternal con|&s;tancy to her, and if po&s;&s;ible to &s;end him &s;ome in|telligence concerning her.</P>
<P>Having thus unburthened his mind, he now felt more happy than he had done &s;ome time. He be|gan to eat his meals with cheerfulne&s;s, hoping &s;oon to receive an an&s;wer to his letter, which arrived in a few days wherein &s;he condoled with him on the unhappy &s;ituation to which he was reduced by his father's barbarity; and telling him that Selima could not re&s;tain a tear on reading his letter; but that young lady had con&s;idered it as improper to &s;hew it her mother, left, piqued by his father's refu&s;al, and influenced by pride, &s;he might be induced to u&s;e her daughter in the &s;ame manner&mdash;but what plea&s;ed him above all, was the following po&s;t&s;cript in Selima's own hand:
<LETTER>
<P>I partake in the unea&s;ine&s;s your father's cruel behavior has occa&s;ioned; but if my love can afford any con&s;olation, you po&s;&s;e&s;s it:&mdash;Make your&s;elf as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible, and be a&s;&s;ured my affection &s;hall only cea&s;e with death.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>"Adieu: Remember "SELIMA."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The&s;e few lines operated like an elixer on his di&s;|tracted
<PB N="9" REF="033700_0009_0FF8FB6360C32560">
mind, and re&s;tored him to his wonted tran|quility. The family judged from the cheerfulne&s;s of his countenance, that he had got the better of this fooli&s;h pa&s;&s;ion, as they called it.&mdash;His father and tutor were al&s;o inclined to believe the &s;ame; and their &s;u&s;picions being lulled a&s;leep, he carried on his corre&s;pondence with Mrs. R&mdash; and Selima for &s;ome time, without interruption, till at length an incident happened which gave ri&s;e to a di&s;covery, which involved the ill-fated Eugenius in fre&s;h trou|bles, and reduced him, if po&s;&s;ible, to a more pitiable &s;ituation than before.</P>
<P>Moro&s;us unfortunately ob&s;erved a &s;ervant deliver his &s;on a letter, and though he imagined it was con|cerning his amour he took no notice of it at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time after, he &s;ent the tutor to Eugenius, in order to di&s;cover if po&s;&s;ible the pre&s;ent &s;tate of his mind concerning Selima, who artfully in&s;inuated he was glad to find he had forgotten that young lady: But Eugenius, with more &s;incerity than pru|dence, an&s;wered, "No, &s;ir, I have not forgotten her, and though I may appear tranquil in this long and cruel ab&s;ence from her, yet her lovely image is too deeply engraven on my heart ever to be era&s;ed, either by time or misfortune." "So much the wor&s;e, (replied the tutor) I pity you; for your fa|ther this moment &s;ent me to tell you, he intends di&s;|po&s;ing of you in marriage, as al&s;o to prepare you for that event, and you know his di&s;po&s;ition will not brook a denial." "Impo&s;&s;ible, (cried Eugenius) by obeying my father, I forfeit my honor&mdash;What then can I do."</P>
<P>His father had in reality no intentions to marry him, but tried this experiment to &s;ee if it were po&s;&s;ible to make him forget Selima; and finding this fail, he had recour&s;e to other expedients, which proved equally ineffectual. He &s;ent for the &s;ervant
<PB N="10" REF="033700_0010_0FF8FB7172E119C8">
he had &s;een give him the letter, who by threats and per&s;ua&s;ions di&s;covered the corre&s;pondence that had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between his &s;on and Selima. However, Moro&s;us ordered for the future to bring him all the letters that came for his &s;on: And what was his a&s;|toni&s;hment when he found, in the fir&s;t letter he in|tercepted, to what length the young lovers had gone; but he did not fail an&s;wering this him&s;elf, and ac|cordingly informed Mrs. R&mdash; that he was deter|mined to marry his &s;on to a lady he had fixed upon, and begged her, in order to wean his affections from Selima, to write him word &s;he was on the point of marriage.</P>
<P>Mrs. R&mdash;, knowing the rank of Moro&s;us, complied with his reque&s;t; and the next letter Eu|genius received, brought him the di&s;agreeable news of a &s;uppo&s;ed match that was on foot between Selima and a gentleman of her parent's choice, whom the former had con&s;ented to marry.</P>
<P>His father expecting this news would drive him to the extremity of de&s;eperation, ordered the tutor to be pre&s;ent when he knew the letter would arrive; and the precaution was very wi&s;ely taken, for, without doubt, had he been alone he would put a period to his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>He raved with the madne&s;s of a man bereft of his &s;en&s;es, and his father coming in at the di&s;turbance, relaxing his former &s;everity of look, endeavored by gentlene&s;s to bring him to rea&s;on, pretending ignor|ance of the cau&s;e from whence this &s;udden phrenzy proceeded. "Leave me, (cried the afflicted Eugeni|us) to my fate; a&s;k me not whence my &s;orrow ari&s;es; as well you know you your&s;elf have cau&s;ed it, by refu&s;ing to give your con&s;ent to my union with Selima, who, alas! is now in&s;upportable; deprive me of it, O barbarous father, at once&punc;"</P>
<P>He uttered the&s;e words with &s;uch vehemence, that
<PB N="11" REF="033700_0011_0FF8FB7F33F404B0">
his father feared this affair would end in &s;ome di&s;|mal cata&s;trophe. He therefore thought it nece&s;&s;ary not to leave him to him&s;elf, till he had endeavored by every argument in his power to convince him how de&s;picable it was for a man of &s;pirit and under|&s;tanding to be &s;ubdued by &s;uch a weakne&s;s. In the interval, when rea&s;on triumphed over madne&s;s, he &s;eemed to comply with his father's advice, as he thought that would be the only and &s;ure&s;t means to gain more liberty and obtain an opportunity of go|ing to Oxford, to &s;atiate his revenge upon his &s;up|po&s;ed happy rival, and puni&s;h the perfidy of Selima. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o credulous was he, that though the letter was &s;ufficient to give him &s;ufficient proof of his mi&s;tre&s;s's infidelity, yet he imputed it to her parents having heard of the difficulties his father had made to their union, and that they in revenge had forced their daughter to marry, contrary to her inclination, for he &s;till thought Selima incapable of deceit.</P>
<P>Fortune &s;eemed to favour the unfortunate Eugenius; for a few weeks after, his father was obliged to go to Oxford on Bu&s;ine&s;s of importance. This gave him an opportunity to carry his intended project into execution. His father was not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picious of his &s;on, but imagined that by the indifference he feigned, he had forgot every thing relating to Selima, &s;o accordingly took him with him.</P>
<P>Eugenius, however, went as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after his arrival in the country to Mrs. R&mdash;'s, who was much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him. At his earne&s;t &s;olicitation to be informed who the happy rival was, that Selima had preferred to him, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he confe&s;&s;ed the deceit that had been put upon him at his father's reque&s;t. This intelligence brought a compo&s;ure to his troubled mind, which for a long time it had been unacquainted with; he now with eagerne&s;s demanded, if Selima lived where &s;he did formerly? and was told &s;he did not; that &s;he had been ill &s;ome time, and that her di&s;order was now grown to &s;uch a height, that her life was de&s;paired off. This was a new cau&s;e of unhappine&s;s; but he determined to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>Mrs. R&mdash;, who &s;aw her every day, promi&s;ed to acquaint her mo|ther of his arrival, and to beg the favor that he might be permitted to &s;ee this young Lady. But after the deceit he had already experi|enced, he paid no regard to promi&s;es, but endeavored to find out an expedient to introduce him&s;elf. Altho' he was fearful his pre&s;ence might occa&s;ion an emotion that might increa&s;e her illne&s;s, yet he could not help thinking it would have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> her plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="033700_0012_0FF8C20C470CCF40">Flu&s;hed with the&s;e hopes he made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to find out the phy&s;ician that attended, who happened fortunately to be one who had vi&s;ited him&punc; in a fit of illne&s;s a few years back; and making him&s;elf known, begged the favor of him: <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">et him accompany him in the next vi&s;it he &s;hould make to Selima. The phy&s;ician complied, and he accompanied him that evening to Mrs. C&mdash;'s.</P>
<P>Eugenius not being per&s;onally known to any of the dome&s;tics, gain|ed admittance as a friend of the phy&s;ician. When he entered Selima's chamber, he &s;aw her mother kneeling by the bed-&s;ide drowned in tears. In de&s;pite of his efforts to the contrary, he could not help &s;hedding tears of latent tenderne&s;s on beholding this melancholy &s;cene; which plainly di&s;covered the intere&s;ting part he bore in her di&s;order. As &s;he was rai&s;ed up to receive &s;ome nouri&s;hment, he beheld her face, once the glowing &s;eat of florid health and yield bloom, all wan and covered with deadly palene&s;s.

<P>Unhappy youth! this was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> much, his fortitude could not with|&s;tand it; he remained &s;en&s;eless for &s;ome time.

His grief threw him into a fever, which alas! terminated his life, and he died a melan|choly victim to de&s;pair.</P>
