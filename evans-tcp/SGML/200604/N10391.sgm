<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following Poem, or as perhaps it may be better &s;tyled Poetical Ora|tion, may &s;eem to have been rather unhappy in the choice of his &s;ubject, which being a good deal hi&s;torical, did not admit of much poetic dre&s;s or ornament, nor gave much &s;cope to fan|cy or imagination to exert it&s;elf, that in which the great &s;trength of a poet lies. With re&s;pect to this he would beg leave to ob&s;erve, that the &s;ubject was cho&s;en perhaps happily enough, as the foundation of an Exerci&s;e in an in&s;titution under the patronage of gentlemen di&s;tingui&s;hed as friends to Revelation, and on an occa&s;ion when the greater number of them were convened.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place it may be objected, that an imitation of the poet Milton may be traced through the whole of the performance, though the Author has not been able to attain to any thing
<PB REF="013172_0003_0F910421577762A0">
of the &s;pirit of that immortal bard. To this he has only to reply, that an imitation of great originals is placed by Longinus among the &s;ources of good writing. He therefore con|ceives him&s;elf free from cen&s;ure on account of any imitation of the poet Milton, which may be &s;een in his performance, though he is &s;en&s;ible of his unhappine&s;s in not having been able to at|tain to any degree of his excellent &s;pirit. This however is a misfortune common to him with many hone&s;t writers, and for which he throws him&s;elf on the candour of the Public.</P>

<P>This in&s;titution, though of few years &s;tanding has ri&s;en to con&s;iderable eminence, and is &s;till carried on with a &s;pirit, which does honour to the Province. It is &s;ituated in a part of the Colo|ny very di&s;tant from the Seminaries of reputation to the North|ward, and near the Bay of Che&s;apeak into which many rivers emp|ty them&s;elves from Maryland and Virginia on the We&s;tern &s;hore and afford an ea&s;y communication. It was very much wanted and is of real &s;ervice to the advancement of virtue and &s;cience in that part of America.</P>
<P>It may not perhaps be impertinent to give &s;ome view of the ge|neral plan upon which this School is conducted. A board of Tru&s;tees co&s;i&s;ting of 15 Gentlemen of the fir&s;t reputation in the county, convene once every three months, or oftener if nece&s;&s;a|ry, in order to in&s;pect the &s;ituation and regulate the affairs of the &s;chool. A &s;teward is cho&s;en by them who lays in provi&s;ions of the be&s;t kind and at the lowe&s;t rates, for which he brings in his bill at the expiration of a year: This with the wages of the &s;ervants and principal Cook is equally a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on the &s;tudents. From the great plenty and cheapne&s;s of provi&s;ions in this &s;ettlement, and the oeconomy of the Tru&s;tees in managing the School, the expen|ces of education &s;eldom amount to more than &pound; 18 per annum&mdash;Board &pound; 13&mdash;Tuition &pound; 5.</P>
<P>The plan of education is the &s;ame with that pur&s;ued in other &s;chools of character, and therefore needs not be mentioned. With re&s;pect to the internal regulation it may &s;uffice to ob&s;erve, that the Bell rings for prayers generally at &s;unri&s;e; for &s;tudy at the inter|val of half an hour. The remaining part of the day is divided between &s;tudy and vacation. In the evening the bell rings for prayers, after which the &s;tudents retire to their chambers.</P>
<P>The &s;chool is placed in a genteel neighbourhood, having in view the dwellings of &s;everal Gentlemen of con&s;iderable property, who are con&s;tantly attentive to its wants, and ready to do the &s;tudents every good office in their power.</P>
<P>It may now be a&s;ked why &s;o particular in the account of this in&s;titution, and what has it to do with an exerci&s;e delivered at Na&s;&s;au-Hall in the province of New-Jer&s;ey? The author has prin|cipally this to reply, that on re&s;iding &s;ome time in the county of Somer&s;et, he became acquainted with the merit of the &s;chool, and thought him&s;elf under an obligation as a wellwi&s;her to mankind, to recommend it to the Public.</P></NOTE>.</L>
