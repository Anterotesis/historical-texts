<P><HI>THe Gentleman concern|ed in this Paper being assured, That he is not the only One that needs these Instructions, and that the Benefit he reaps by them, would not be the less by their being Publick, has so far befriended the World as to Expose them to the View of

all: But it being the peculiar Fate of Letters, to be at the Dispose of those to whom they are sent, This has not, perhaps, those Advantages and Accessions which would have been given it, had the Inditer been the Publisher: Yet as it is, all kind of</HI> Readers <HI>will be enter|tainted, from the</HI> Usefulness <HI>of the</HI> Subject, <HI>The</HI> Variety <HI>of the</HI> Matter, <HI>The</HI> Freedom <HI>that is taken, and the</HI> Conciseness <HI>of the</HI> Suggestions, <HI>which will further oblige them to measure the</HI> Words, <HI>not by their Num|ber, but Weight. If this be perused by Men that live up to the Advices proposed,. They cannot but be Confirmed and Gratified, to find themselves

so luckily Transcribed And if This falls into the Hands of</HI> Novices, <HI>(and such are all once, if Experience must make men Wise) this little</HI> Vade Mecum <HI>shall suddenly Enrich them with a</HI> Treasure <HI>of</HI> Ob|servations, <HI>which they may hourly imploy, and continue to do so, even while they live: Nay, all must be Gainers here, when they find the</HI> good Chri|stian <HI>reconciled to the</HI> good Companion, <HI>and the</HI> Scholar <HI>Taught to be a</HI> Gentleman.</P>
<P><HI>It hath been observed, That Elaborate studied Discourses have not been so Contributive to Wisdom, as the Memories and private Remarks of Emi|nent

and Conversing Persons. And it is to be wished, That they would communicate their Experiences a little more, and that some would insist on this Subject so minutely, as to de|scend to the Particulars of</HI> Behaviour, <HI>that befits men in their several Qualities and Professions, This would be a greater Kindness to all Societies than that which is intended them from the Experiments and modern Improvements that are now the Boasts and Triumphs of some</HI> Vertuosi's.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have been infi|nitely advantaged by your Education in the University, which will have a perpetual good Effect upon you, and give you <HI>Lustre</HI> in the Eyes of the World: But that you may be further <HI>Useful</HI> and <HI>Accept|able</HI> to Mankind, you must <HI>pare off</HI> something you have contracted there, and <HI>add</HI> also to your own Stores from <HI>Observation</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="000745_0008_0FAA5286EAA4DAD8">
a way of Learning as far be|yond that by <HI>Precept,</HI> as the Knowledge of a Traveller exceeds that which is gotten by the Map.</P>
<P>An <HI>Ackademick Life</HI> is an <HI>Horizon</HI> between two Worlds, for men enter upon it Chil|dren, and as such they must judge and act, though with Difference according to their own Pregnancy, the Ingenuity of their Teachers, and the manner of their being taught; and when they pass from thence, they launch into a <HI>New World,</HI> their <HI>P</HI>assions at high Water, and full of them|selves, as Young Men are wont to be, and such as are dipt in unusual Learning,
<PB N="3" REF="000745_0009_0FAA528955F14388">
and if they go on so, they are lost: Besides that, there is a Husk and Shell that grows up with the Learning they acquired, which they must throw away, caused, perchance, by the Childish|ness of their State, or Forma|lities of the Place, or the Ruggedness of Retirement, the not considering of which hath made many a great Scholar unserviceable to the World.</P>
<P>To propound many Rules for the manage of your self, were to refer you back to the Book again, and there is even a <HI>Native Discretion</HI> that some are endowed with, which defends them from
<PB N="4" REF="000745_0010_0FAA528AAAC0AFD8">
<HI>gross Absurdities</HI> in Conver|sation, though there be none but may be helped by some Admonitions.</P>
<P>I suppose you understand the nature of <HI>Habits</HI> and <HI>Pas|sions:</HI> I suppose you likewise what I know you to be, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> To be <HI>Advisable, Observant</HI> and of a <HI>sedate Temper;</HI> Therefore you will be suffi|ciently instructed with a few Intimations: For he that reflects upon himself, and considers his Passions, and accommodates himself to the World, cannot need many Directions. I suppose you also to be <HI>principl'd</HI> with <HI>Re|ligion</HI> and <HI>Morality,</HI> which is to be valued before any
<PB N="5" REF="000745_0011_0FAA528B6C8114E8">
<HI>Learning,</HI> and is an ease and pleasure to the Mind, and always secures a firm Repu|tation, let the World be never so Wicked. No man ever gains a Reverence for his <HI>Vice,</HI> but <HI>Virtue</HI> commands it. <HI>Vi|cious Men</HI> indeed have been <HI>Popular,</HI> but never for being so, but for their <HI>Virtues</HI> annexed: They administer their Imployments <HI>well</HI> and <HI>wisely,</HI> They are <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>obliging,</HI> They are free and <HI>magnanimous,</HI> They are <HI>faith|ful</HI> and <HI>couragious.</HI> It is al|ways some <HI>brave Thing</HI> that recommends them to the good Opinion of the World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Advices</HI> I here lay down are rather <HI>Negative</HI> than
<PB N="6" REF="000745_0012_0FAA528C63F8DCC0">
<HI>Positive;</HI> For though I can|not direct you where you are to fail throughout your whole Course, yet I may safely shew you where you must not split your self.</P>
<P>And the first <HI>Rock</HI> I dis|cover, on which Young Scho|lars shipwrack themselves, is <HI>vaunting</HI> of the <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Places</HI> concerned in their Edu|cation. I therefore advise you to be sparing in your Commendations of your Uni|versity, Colledge, Tutor, or the Doctor you most there admire; for either all is taken for granted, or you only be|tray your Affection and Par|tialty, or you impose your Judgment for a Standard to
<PB N="7" REF="000745_0013_0FAA528CF17D1140">
others: You discover what you think, not what they are. An early kindness may make you as blind as an unjust Pre|judice, and others will smile to see you confident of that which it may be, they know they can confute. This holds in all kinds of Commendations, which should be modest and moderate, Not <HI>Unseasonable,</HI> not <HI>Unsuitable,</HI> not <HI>Hyperbo|lical;</HI> for an Excess here creates Envy to the <HI>P</HI>erson extoll'd, and is a virtual De|traction from others you con|verse with, and your own Understanding is measured by it. Nay, it is a presumption in some to commend at all; <HI>for he that praises another, would
<PB N="8" REF="000745_0014_0FAA528DB7F750F8">
have him valued upon his own Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore it is a Disparage|ment to be commended by a Fool, except he concurs with the Vogue, or speaks from the Mouth of another; you must indeed, when you speak of mens Persons (which with|out provocation should never be) represent them candidly and fairly, and you are bound to give your Friend his due Elogy, when his Fame is con|cerned, or you are required to do it, or may do him a kind|ness in it. But remember, that when you give a Person a particular Character, it re|ceives its estimate from your
<PB N="9" REF="000745_0015_0FAA528E808DD498">
Wisdom, be Temperate there|fore as well as Just.</P>
<P>When you come into Com|pany, be not forward to show your <HI>Proficiency,</HI> nor impose your <HI>Academical Discourses,</HI> nor glitter affectedly in <HI>Terms of Art,</HI> which is a <HI>vanity</HI> indesent to Young Men that have Confidence, and hear of Tem|per. Nor on the other hand must you be <HI>morose</HI> or <HI>difficult</HI> to give an Account of your self to <HI>Inquisitive</HI> or <HI>Learned Men;</HI> let your Answers be <HI>direct</HI> and <HI>concise.</HI> It is both your <HI>Wisdom</HI> and your <HI>Kind|ness</HI> to come to the point at first, only in Conferences or Debates, speak not all you have to say at once, in an
<PB N="10" REF="000745_0016_0FAA528F52EE4870">
<HI>entire Harangue,</HI> but suffer your self to be broached by degrees, and keep an Argument for reserve. What you say at first may perhaps give Satisfaction, however you gain Respite for Recollection; and when all is out at last you will be thought to have more in store.</P>
<P>And because the <HI>Mouth</HI> is the Fountain of our <HI>Weal</HI> or <HI>Wo,</HI> and it is the greatest In|stance of <HI>P</HI>rudence to rule that little Member, the <HI>Tongue,</HI> and he indeed is <HI>a Perfect Man that offends not in a word;</HI> for all our Follies and Passions are let out that way. There are many things to be observed in the managing of Discourse, I only say in general, That you
<PB N="11" REF="000745_0017_0FAA528FE8600770">
must not speak with <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Violence,</HI> nor with <HI>Reflection</HI> upon mens <HI>Persons,</HI> nor with <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Self-praise.</HI> No Man therefore should be his own <HI>Historian,</HI> that is, Talk of his own <HI>Feats,</HI> his <HI>Travels,</HI> his <HI>Conferences</HI> with <HI>great Men; &amp;c</HI> nor boast of his <HI>Descent</HI> and <HI>Alliance,</HI> nor recount his <HI>Treasure,</HI> or the manage of his <HI>Estate,</HI> all which wearies out the greatest <HI>P</HI>atience, and <HI>without a Provocation</HI> expresses an intollerable <HI>Vanity</HI> and im|plyes a believing that others are <HI>affected</HI> and <HI>concerned</HI> in these things as much as him|self. The like weakness is in talking of ones <HI>Trade</HI> or <HI>Pro|fession</HI> to those that neither
<PB N="12" REF="000745_0018_0FAA5290AFB539F0">
<HI>mind</HI> nor <HI>understand it.</HI> In|deed, if the Company be all of one piece, their debating any thing that relates to all, may be <HI>Useful;</HI> but it is imperti|nent in mixt Company to be|tray your <HI>Skill</HI> or <HI>Inclination.</HI> In like manner, he is not to be brook't, that over a <HI>Glass of Wine</HI> will turn <HI>States-man</HI> or <HI>Divine,</HI> perplex good Fellows with <HI>Intreagues of Government, Cases of Conscience, or School Controversies.</HI> which are <HI>too serious</HI> and <HI>too sacred</HI> to be the Subjects of <HI>Common Talk.</HI> Let no Mans <HI>Vice</HI> be your <HI>Theam,</HI> nor your Friends, because you love him; not your Enemy's, because he is so, and in you it will be expounded <HI>P</HI>artiality
<PB N="13" REF="000745_0019_0FAA529167D8D228">
and Revenge; not of any other, because you are certainly unconcerned in him, and may possibly be mistaken of him.</P>
<P>Let not the <HI>Lapses</HI> or <HI>ridi|culous Accidents</HI> or <HI>Behaviours</HI> of Men in <HI>Drink,</HI> or in <HI>Love</HI> be taken Notice of after, or upbraided to them in jest or earnest; for no man loves to have his <HI>Folly</HI> remembred, nor to have the consequence of <HI>Wine</HI> or <HI>Passion</HI> imputed to him; and he cannot but like you worse, if he finds they have left an Impression upon you. <HI>Every Mans Fault should be every Mans Secret,</HI> as he sins doubly that publishes his own shame, for he adds scandal to the sin, so does every Man in|crease
<PB N="14" REF="000745_0020_0FAA529227F11900">
the Scandal that is the propogator of it.</P>
<P>When you <HI>carve out Dis|course</HI> for others, let your Choice be rather of <HI>Things</HI> than of <HI>Persons</HI> of <HI>Historical matters,</HI> rather than the <HI>present Age,</HI> of things <HI>distant</HI> &amp; <HI>remote,</HI> rather than at <HI>Home,</HI> and of your <HI>Neighbours;</HI> and do not, after all these Restrictions, fear want of Discourse; for there is no|thing in the World but you may speak of it <HI>Usefully</HI> or <HI>Pleasantly. Everything</HI> (says <HI>Herbert) is big with jest, and has Wit in it,</HI> if you can find it out.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Behaviour,</HI> that is certainly best, which best ex|presses the <HI>Sincerity</HI> of your
<PB N="15" REF="000745_0021_0FAA529490169760">
heart. I think this Rule fails not, that that kind of Conver|sation that lets men into your Soul, to see the goodness of your Nature, and Integrity of your Mind is most accept|able; for be assured, every man loves another for his <HI>Honesty;</HI> To this every <HI>Knave</HI> pretends, and with the <HI>show</HI> of this he deceives; nay, the sensual love of bad men is founded upon this. Nothing loves a Body but for a Soul, nor a Soul, but for such a <HI>Dis|position</HI> as answers to that Idea of goodness which is in the Mind.</P>
<P>This is that, that reconciles you to some men at the <HI>first congress;</HI> for usually you <HI>read</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="000745_0022_0FAA52956C77CA00">
mens Souls in their faces, if they be young &amp; uncorrupted, and you forever decline some Countenances which seem to declare, that some <HI>Vice</HI> or <HI>Pas|sion</HI> has the predominacy; and though sometimes you are deceived yet you persist in your pre-possession till the <HI>behaviour</HI> doth signally confute what the Countenance did threaten.</P>
<P>This makes a <HI>starcht formal Behaviour</HI> Odious, because it is forced, and unnatural, and assum'd as a <HI>disguise</HI> and suf|fers not the Soul to shine clear|ly and freely through the out|ward Actions.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then, your Actions must discover you to be your <HI>own Master;</HI> for he is a miser|able
<PB N="17" REF="000745_0023_0FAA5296AAE47FD0">
Slave that is under the Tyranny of his Passions: And that Fountain teeming pair, <HI>Lust</HI> and <HI>Rage</HI> must especially be subdued.</P>
<P>That of <HI>Love</HI> (to give it the milder Name) so far as it is <HI>vitious,</HI> I take to be seated principally in the <HI>Fancy,</HI> and there you must apply your Cure; for I ascribe its <HI>vehe|mence</HI> not so much to the <HI>Con|stitution</HI> as to the <HI>pampering</HI> the <HI>Body,</HI> and mens letting <HI>loose</HI> their <HI>Eyes, Tongues</HI> and <HI>Imaginations</HI> upon amorous Incentives, and not keeping a sence and awe of <HI>Religion</HI> upon them. For if you live in an Age and Place where <HI>Shame</HI> and <HI>civil Penalties</HI> have no
<PB N="18" REF="000745_0024_0FAA52978D299160">
force, you must have recourse to <HI>Religous means,</HI> and the <HI>Grace of God</HI> for Restraint. <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">st</HI> is more <HI>distinctly forbidden</HI> by our <HI>Christianity,</HI> than any other thing; therefore it ought more sacredly to be avoided.</P>
<P>If you grow <HI>Troublesom</HI> to your self, in Gods name make use of that <HI>honourable Remedy</HI> he has provided; and in the intrim, if you can allay your Fancy, and keep your Incli|nations <HI>undetermined,</HI> I think a <HI>promisen us</HI> Conversation is the safest; for many that have lived in the Shade and Retire|ment, when they came abroad were ruined by <HI>doting</HI> on the <HI>first Thing</HI> they met with. And
<PB N="19" REF="000745_0025_0FAA529840BA7278">
this is oft the effect of Distance and Caution.</P>
<P>The other spring of Mis|chief is <HI>Anger,</HI> which usually flames out from an <HI>unnamed Pride</HI> and <HI>want of Manners,</HI> and many other untollerable In|firmities, so that there is no living in the world without <HI>quenching it,</HI> for it will render you both <HI>Troublesom</HI> and <HI>Ridi|culous,</HI> and you shall be avoid|ed by all, like a Beast of Prey. The <HI>Stoicks</HI> pretend to be successful Eradicators of this <HI>Passion,</HI> and their Books may be usefully read for <HI>Taming it.</HI> But themselves have retained many ill humors behind, which are worse than a <HI>transient Rage,</HI> and are most abhorrent from
<PB N="20" REF="000745_0026_0FAA52991D5070B8">
all Society, as <HI>Moroseness, Fa|stidious Contempt of others, Pee|vishness Caption, Scurrility, Willfulness, &amp;c.</HI> Which issue from some <HI>Tempers</HI> and some <HI>Principles</HI> which men are apt to suck in, to feed their natu|ral Dispositions with; where|as the World is not to be en|tertained with Frowns and dark Looks. Be as severe <HI>ad intra</HI> as you will, but be wholly complaisant <HI>ad extra,</HI> and let not your strictness to your self make you censorious and Uneasie to others; thus many mortified men have been very <HI>Unruly,</HI> to the great scan|dal of what they professed.</P>
<P>Avoid therefore going to <HI>Law</HI> at your first setting out,
<PB N="21" REF="000745_0027_0FAA5299AC3C2C48">
for that will teach you to be <HI>litigious</HI> before your temper is well fixed, and will contract an <HI>habit of wrangling</HI> with your Neighbours, and at last delight in it, like a <HI>Sophister,</HI> with ar|guing in the Schools: You may observe many who have entered upon <HI>entangled Estates</HI> to become Vexatious, and have quite lost the <HI>Debonariness of</HI> their Dispositions.</P>
<P>Be always <HI>mild</HI> and <HI>easie</HI> to those that are about you, your <HI>Relations</HI> &amp; <HI>Servants,</HI> not only for their fakes, but your own. If you be displeased at every Piccodillo, you will become <HI>habitually Froward,</HI> which you cannot put off when you ap|pear abroad. And remember
<PB N="22" REF="000745_0028_0FAA529A6754C578">
that if you be <HI>easie top your self,</HI> you will so to every Body else, and you will be <HI>Wellcome</HI> every where.</P>
<P>This produces <HI>Comity</HI> and <HI>Affability,</HI> which is a great Or|nament of <HI>Behaviour;</HI> This argues you are <HI>well within,</HI> and that you are a <HI>Lover of Mankind.</HI> It is a Mixture made up of <HI>Civilities</HI> and <HI>Freedom,</HI> suited to the Condition of the Person you converse with, a quality as to <HI>Modes</HI> and <HI>Circumstances,</HI> we fetch from beyond the Seas; for the meer <HI>English-man</HI> is supposed to be <HI>defective</HI> in it; as being <HI>Rough</HI> in <HI>Address,</HI> not easily acquainted, and <HI>blunt</HI> even when he obliges; though I think it not worth

the Charge the <HI>Gentleman</HI> is at, that travels for it; Nay, I am sorry for the poor <HI>R</HI>eturns many make, that import hither the <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Carriage,</HI> and <HI>As|surance</HI> of the <HI>French,</HI> therewith quitting their own staple na|tive Commodities of much greater Value, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>Sin|cerity</HI> and <HI>Generosity</HI> of the <HI>English Disposition.</HI> None is more <HI>melted</HI> with a <HI>Civility</HI> than an <HI>English-man,</HI> but he loves not you should be <HI>verbose</HI> &amp; <HI>ceremonious</HI> in it; take heed therefore of <HI>over-acting</HI> your <HI>Civilities</HI> to men <HI>unconcerned</HI> in you, that must conclude you <HI>impertinent</HI> or <HI>designing. Free|dom</HI> is likewise acceptable, and a great advantage to a Con|verser.

We commonly make make it the <HI>effect</HI> of <HI>Familarity,</HI> but it should be the <HI>cause</HI> of it; but <HI>Prudence</HI> must bound it and apply it. Be free when you <HI>speak,</HI> when you <HI>give,</HI> when you spend, &amp; when you allow your <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Company</HI> to your Friends, let nothing of <HI>Confine|ment, Formality</HI> or <HI>Difficulty</HI> be discerned. If you can do a kindness, do it at <HI>first,</HI> That is a double Obligation, and evidences that it was in your heart befor&eacute; it was suggested to you. The Return of Thanks will be but cold, if the obliged finds, that <HI>Impor|tunity, Necessity</HI> Or <HI>after Reason|ings</HI> did extort it from you.</P>
<P>If you would have an

Interest where you live, there must be legible (in all your Actions) <HI>Justice</HI> in your dea|lings between man and man, this is the <HI>cheapest</HI> &amp; the <HI>greatest Policy,</HI> and this alone will se|cure your Reputation with the <HI>Populo.</HI> And to this purpose I only advise <HI>Two Things.</HI></P>

B</HI>e punctual even in small matters, as meeting a Friend, restoring a Book, returning a Paper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for failing in <HI>little th&igrave;ngs</HI> will bring you to fail in <HI>great,</HI> and always render you

<HI>Suspected,</HI> and you shall never be confided in, even when you mean most heartily.</P>

If you would eat in quiet, never run <HI>i</HI>n debt for what you <HI>daily consume:</HI> He that is <HI>necessitated</HI> to this, is the proper Object of an <HI>Alms.</HI> When you <HI>borrow,</HI> chuse rather a rich Creditor, and a great Debt, than many trifling Debts dispersed among poor People; a poor mans little Debt makes the greatest noise.

<P><HI>Prudence</HI> must be discernable in your Actions, as well as <HI>Justice,</HI> and that will appear in nothing more than in the <HI>Choice</HI> of <HI>Confidents</HI> and <HI>Depen|dents;</HI> Your most diffusive love to Mankind cannot be extend|ed very far, for the verge of your Knowledge is not, and need not be great: Out of <HI>Ac|quaintance</HI> you chuse <HI>Familiars,</HI> &amp; out of these you pick <HI>Friends,</HI> but you must not expect them to be such as are described in Books, and talked of by Philo|sophers, that's a <HI>Romantick thing</HI> only to be found in <HI>Utopia</HI> or

Never tell any man you have a Secret, but dare not tell it; you should either go further, or not have gone so far; and press no man <HI>Vehe|mently</HI> to keep concealed what you have committed to him; for that implyes you <HI>suspect</HI> what you have done, and that you <HI>diffide</HI> in his Prudence: It discovers your value of Things, and provokes him to <HI>Incontinence</HI> &amp; breach of Trust; for there is an Itch in Man|kind to be greedy of those Fruits that are most zealously forbidden; and some <HI>P</HI>rohibi|tions do even excite desire.</P>
