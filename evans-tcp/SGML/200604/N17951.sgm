<P>IN the compilation of this volume, it has been the editor's object, while he provided an elegant fund of rational and innocent entertainment, to fix upon &s;uch pieces of poetry as have a tendency to enlarge the under&s;tanding, and re&s;ine the heart. He only hopes for the public approbation in proportion as he has &s;ucceeded in this. He has carefully guarded again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch productions as might</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM. POPE.</HEAD>
<L>'TIS hard to &s;ay, if greater want of &s;kill</L>
<L>Appear in writing, or in judging ill:</L>
<L>But, of the two, le&s;s dang'rous is th'offence,</L>
<L>To tire our patience, than mi&s;lead our &s;en&s;e.</L>
<L>Some few in that, but numbers err in this;</L>
<L>Ten cen&s;ure wrong, for one who writes ami&s;s.</L>
<L>A fool might once him&s;elf alone expo&s;e;</L>
<L>Now one in ver&s;e makes many more in pro&s;e.</L>
<L>'Tis with our judgments, as our watches, none</L>
<L>Go ju&s;t alike, yet each believes his own.</L>
<L>In poets, as true genius is but rare,</L>
<L>True ta&s;te as &s;eldom is the critic's &s;hare;</L>
<L>Both mu&s;t alike from heav'n derive their light,</L>
<L>The&s;e born to judge, as well as tho&s;e to write.</L>
<L>Let &s;uch teach others, who them&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">el,</L>
<L>And cen&s;ure freely, who have written <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</L>
<L>Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true;</L>
<L>But are not critics to their judgment too?</L>
<L>Yet, if we look more clo&s;ely, we &s;hall find</L>
<L>Mo&s;t have the &s;eeds of judgment in their mind:</L>
<L>Nature affords at lea&s;t a glimm'ring light;</L>
<L>The lines, tho' touch'd but faintly, are drawn right.</L>

<L>Remote from man, with God he pa&s;s'd his days,</L>

<L>That vice &s;hould triumph, virtue vice obey;</L>
<L>This &s;prung &s;ome doubts of Providence &s;way:</L>

<L>THE American world, as our hi&s;tories &s;ay,</L>

<L>But peopled by beings whom white men dete&s;t,</L>
<L>The &s;ons of the Tartars that came from the we&s;t.</L>

<L>No learned phy&s;icians vile no&s;trums conceal'd&mdash;</L>

<L>No care to perplex, and no luxury &s;een</L>

<L>Some bow'd to the moon, and &s;ome wor&s;hipp'd the &s;un,</L>
<L>And the king and the captain were center'd in one;</L>

<L>Twelve years after this, &s;ome &s;cores of di&s;&s;enters</L>
<L>To the northernmo&s;t di&s;trict, came &s;eeking adventures;</L>
<L>Outdone by the bi&s;hops, tho&s;e great faggot fighters,</L>
<L>They left them to hell with their ca&s;&s;ocks and mitres.</L>
<L>Thus bani&s;h'd forever, and leaving the &s;od,</L>
<L>The fir&s;t land they &s;aw was the pitch of Cape Cod,</L>
<L>Where, fami&s;h'd with hunger, and quaking with cold,</L>
<L>They plann'd their new Plymouth&mdash;&s;o call'd from the old.</L>
<L>They were, without doubt, a delightful collection;&mdash;</L>
<L>Some came to be rid of a Stuart's direction;</L>
<L>Some &s;ail'd with a view to dominion and riches,</L>
<L>Some to pray without book, and a few to hang witches;</L>
<L>Some came, on the Indians to &s;hed a new light,</L>
<L>Convinc'd, long before, that their own mu&s;t be right,</L>
<L>And that all, who had died in the centuries pa&s;t,</L>
<L>On the devil's lee &s;hore were eternally ca&s;t.</L>
<L>The&s;e exiles were ca&s;t in a whim&s;ical mould,</L>
<L>And were aw'd by their prie&s;ts, like the Hebrews of old;</L>
<L>Di&s;claim'd all pretences to je&s;ting and laughter,</L>
<L>And &s;igh'd their lives through to be happy hereafter.</L>
<L>On a crown immaterial their hearts were intent,</L>
<L>They look'd towards Zion, wherever they went,</L>
<L>Did all things in hope of a future reward,</L>
<L>And worry'd mankind&mdash;for the &s;ake of the Lord.</L>
<L>With rigour exce&s;&s;ive they &s;trengthen'd their reign,</L>
<L>Their laws were conceiv'd in the ill-natur'd &s;train;</L>
<L>With my&s;tical meanings the &s;aint was perplext,</L>
<L>And the fle&s;h and the devil were &s;lain by a text.</L>
<L>The body was &s;courg'd, for the good of the &s;oul,</L>
<L>All folly di&s;courag'd by peevi&s;h controul,</L>
<L>A knot on the head was the &s;ign of no grace,</L>
<L>And the pope and his comrade were pictur'd in lace.</L>
<L>A &s;tove in their churches, or pews lin'd with green,</L>
<L>Were horrid to think of, much more to be &s;een.</L>
<L><PB N="241" REF="023246_0248_0FBEEEF184563AC0">Their bodies were warm'd with the linings of love,</L>

<L>This day was the mournfulle&s;t day in the week:</L>
<L>Except on religion, none ventur'd to &s;peak:</L>
<L>This day was the day to examine their lives,</L>

<L>This beautiful &s;y&s;tem of nature below</L>
<L>They neither con&s;ider'd, nor wanted to know,</L>

<L>The downfall of &s;in, and the reign of the ju&s;t.</L>
