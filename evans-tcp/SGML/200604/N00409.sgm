<HEAD>AN ABRIDGMENT Of the English Military DISCIPLINE.</HEAD>
<P>WHen a Regiment or several Companies are Commanded to draw out, It is necessary that the Major and Adjutant (or at least the Adjutant) be there to give each Company its due Post. The eldest on the Right, the second on the Left, so till the youngest come into the Center. And all Companies (and Bodies of Men) are to draw up at first at the same Order they March at, both in Bank and File, the single Companies
<PB N="4" REF="000508_0003_0FA6A7A03B6BB350">
observing to leave room for the Sargeants and Drums to stand on the Right and Left of each Company.</P>
<P>Before you form your Battalion, remember alwayes to draw out the odd Men from every Company, forming a Rank in opposition at fifty paces distance from the Head of each Company, thereby to have no broken Files, which is much the better and quicker way to compleat your Files, than after your Battali|ons are formed.</P>
<P>When your Companies are thus disposed, the most ready way to form a Battalion, is by these words of Command.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Have a care to form the Battalion.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Musketiers to the Right and Left outwards.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Pikes to the Right and Left inwards,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>March, <HI>interchanging Ground.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>When Pikes and Musketiers interchange Ground, the first Rank of Pikes pass before the first Rank of Musketiers. And it is al|wayes to be observed, that (after any Com|mand for moving) no Man stir before the Word of Command, <HI>March</HI> be given, thereby to make them all move together.</P>
<P>When they have thus changed Ground, they are not to Face to their Leaders till the Word
<PB N="5" REF="000508_0004_0FA6A7A131BE8EE0">
of command be so given. At which time they are then in Battalia, but at close Order in File. And now it is to be observed that the Officers are no more limited to their par|ticular Companies, but are all concerned in the whole. He that Commands, is to see how many Sargeants there are present, and dispose of them in this following manner, <HI>viz.</HI> if a Battalion consist of eight or ten Companies, or more; and the Companies have each two Sargeants, and three Corporals, (who are de|signed to do Sargeants Duty) it is necessary to place two on each Rank to the right and left, and the rest in the Rear; but if the num|ber of Sargeants be fewer, then there can be but one to each Rank, on the Right and Left: the remainder alwayes to be in the Rear, ma|king a Rank parallel to the Souldiers at three Paces distance frow the last Rank.</P>
<P>The Sargeants being placed in this manner: the Drums are to be disposed of, one half on the right, and the other on the left, ranging directly with the first Rank of the Souldiers, unless there be many Drums, and the Ground streight; And then they are to be formed in|to two Ranks, on the Right and Left, to range with the two first Ranks of the Souldiers;
<PB N="6" REF="000508_0005_0FA6A7A1C1F5E848">
And they are alwayes to have their Drums slung, unless Commanded to the contrary.</P>
<P>The Hoboys to be on the right of the Drums, which are on the Right of the Batta|lion, ranged in the same Rank with them.</P>
<P>The Commission-Officers are to take their Posts at the head of the Battalion as the Co|lours are drawn. But the more particular placing of the Officers will be directed here|after.</P>
<P>Now it is to be observed, that tho' the Files are still at their close Order, the Ranks are to have their Distance of Twelve large Feet, which the Sargeants are to be very diligent and active to see kept very even.</P>
<P>The Officer in Chief is to place himself be|fore the centre of the Pikes, about forty pa|ces from them, the better to observe what is done, And that he may be more easily under|stood by the whole Body, He is to be on Horse|back.</P>
<P>The Words of Command are to be given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">urely, that the Soldiers may have time to perform the Exercise without confusion. And above all, <HI>Silence</HI> is to be kept very strictly. And the first Word of Command before you begin the Exercise, is, <HI>Silence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000508_0006_0FA6A7A27B9A1650">
When every thing is thus disposed, The next Word of Command is,</P>
<P><HI>Files, Open to the Right (or to the Left) to your Order.</HI> March.</P>
<P>At which Word every individual man turns to the Hand named, and after a little pause, the Sargeants on the Flank lead the Ranks (which are then Files) directly, forward, as slow as possible, by the least Steps they can make, with their Halberts Advanced, the Iron upwards; observing alwayes for a Rule, To mind the Front, that is, if they move to the Right, every man is to observe his Left hand man. And if they move to the Left, his Right hand man.</P>
<P>As soon as the last man but one of the first Rank stirs his Foot, they are to be command|ed all to <HI>Halt.</HI> And no man is to stir after that Word.</P>
<P>In this manner of opening of Files, no man is to stir till his Leader be four foot from him; And then to move and keep at that distance, which will make them three foot distance from each other, when Faced to the Proper Front.</P>
<P>As soon as they are Commanded to <HI>Halt,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="000508_0007_0FA6A7A33A0EB390">
The next Word of Command is,</P>
<P><HI>To your Leader.</HI></P>
<P>The Captains and Lieutenants are to carry their Pikes Comported alwayes when they move to the Right or Left, and the Colours to be Advanced. The Sargeants are to be ve|ry mindful to keep the Ranks even, and at twelve large feet distance, and the Files at three. And for the better keeping Files streight (after they are Opened to their Or|der) every man is to look to his Right and Left hand man, and to see that he has an equal distance from both, especially the File-leaders, by whom all the rest are governed.</P>
<P>The next thing is to Draw the Officers from the Front of the Battalion to the Rere, which is done by these Words of Command.</P>
<P><HI>Have a Care of the Exercise.</HI></P>
<P>At which Word of Command, the Muske|tiers are to pull off their right hand Gloves, and put them under their Girdles.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000508_0008_0FA6A7A3F8A24A80">
<HI>Officers take your Posts of Exercise in the Rere. March.</HI></P>
<P>Which is to be done by the Officers Fa|cing to the Right about, The Captains March|ing at a good round pace in one Rank, and the Lieutenants and Colours in another, Two paces behind the Captains, who as well as the Lieutenants are to carry their Pikes Ad|vanced.</P>
<P>When they are come into the Rere, the Lieutenants &amp; Ensigns are to be in one Rank, Eight paces from the Sargeants, and the Lieu|tenants and Ensigns Eight. The Captains being from the last Rank of Soldiers Thirteen paces, and the Lieutenants and Colours Ele|ven.</P>
<P>At the same Word of Command or Signal for the Officers to take their Posts of Exercise in the Rere, Six Sergeants of those that are Posted in the Rere are to March through the Intervals of the Files into the Front and Post themselves Forty six paces from the First Rank of Souldiers, that is, Six paces advanced before the Commander in Chief, where they are to Range themselves so as to make a parallel Line with the Battalion, and to keep the Front clear and undisturbed. And at the same word of Command, the Pikemen are to joyn their Left hands to their Pikes even with their Shoulders.</P>

After the front rank stands up, they are to be commanded to pre|sent and Fire, and after that to Recover their Arms, the Pikemen at the fame word of Com|mand being to Recover their Pikes. The front rank which fired last and all the rest that have not Primed and Loaded their Arms, are to do it (or in Exercise to make the motion of it) as they March, and are afterwards to Shoulder. The Granadiers are to be Ordered as is before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tioned.</HI></P>
<P>The reason why the Pikes do not <HI>Charge</HI> when the Musketiers <HI>Present,</HI> but continue Ported, is, That the Musketiers in firing may not shatter the ends of them with their Shot, but when the Musketiers have fired, if there be occasion, the Pikes may be made to <HI>Charge</HI> from their <HI>Port</HI> in the twinkling of an Eye.</P>

<P>THE Major General for the day, haveing with him such of the Guards of Horse as shall be thought fit, and ordered by the General for the Security of the Camp, is to March before the Army that he may have time to view the ground and to Settle the Camp, not far from Water if it may be with convenience, Which being done, He is to order the Quarter-Master|General to Set out the Ground to the Majors of the Brigades, who thereupon Set it out to the Adjutants of each Regiment, who divide it for each Troop or Company. The Major General in the mean while is to Ride about the Camp to Post the Main-guards as he finds best for the Safety of the Army, and is to order the Quar|ter Master General what ground or Village he shall take up for the Kings Quarters, as also some commodious place for the Park of Artil|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ary, and another for the Bread-Carts which is commonly near the Center of the Army with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Hospital.</P>
<P>When every thing hath been done as above mentioned, and the Camp all Marked out, Then the Major General is to send an <HI>Ald de Camp</HI> to give Notice to the General that all is ready. And at the Entring into the Camp the Major General is to meet the General to give him a full account of every particular, The Adjutants Ge|neral

of Horse and Foot attending always on the General that they may be ready to Execute his Orders, and make Detachments without delay.</P>
<P>It is the usual Practice to Camp an Army in two Lines, The Second distant from the First Three hundred Paces; That is, From the Head of the first Line to the Head of the Second, whereof One hundred and twenty are for the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|camping of the First Line, so that there remains One hundred and eighty Paces for the distance between the last Tents of the first Line and the Head of the Second. And if the Army Encamp with a Reserve, Then the same distance is to be observed by them.</P>
<P>The Horse are to be Posted on the Wings, and the Foot in the Middle in such a manner that the Lines of the Camp look towards the Ene|my and be Covered behind by a River, Brook, of March, if it may be with Convenience.</P>
<P>Every Squadron consisting in Three Troops, &amp; fifty men each Troop, must be allowed fifty paces. And every Battalion consisting of sixteen Companies and fifty men in each Company, must have One hundred paces allowed for their Encamping.</P>
<P>All Troops or Companies of Horse of Foot consisting but of fifty men are to be Encamped on one Row of Baraques or Hutts; But when Troops or Companies consist of more men, there must be two Files of Baraques or Hutts.</P>
<P>It is to be observed that in each Squadron or Battalion, The Colonels Company be always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|on

the Right or Left, And there make their Row of Hutts. Behind them must be left a space for the Street. Then the Second Company make their Row of Hutts, near to which the Third makes theirs, leaving the space of two Foot onely between their Hutts, which is called the By Street. And the same thing is to be observed by the Horse.</P>
<P>The Hutts of the Foot always open towards the Street, the Baraques of the Cavalry always to|wards the Horse Heads.</P>
<P>The Hutts of the Quarter-Master and Sar|geants are always to be at the Head of the Troop|ers and Soldiers, And the Officers Tents behind.</P>
<P>The Camp of the first Brigade of the Army is on the right hand of the first line, That of the se|cond on the Left, the Third is Posted on the right of the Second Line, the Fourth on the Left, and the rest in the Center according to their Seniority. This is to be observed among the Horse as well as Foot.</P>
<P>The Dragoons are never to be Encamped in the Body of the Army, but have their Camp at the Head or on the Wings on that side where the grea|test danger is, serving always as an Out-guard for the Army.</P>
<P>Every Regiment is to have a Guard at the Head of their Camp, and the Major General for the day, takes care to place the great Guard in a pro|per place and distance from the <HI>Army</HI> towards the Enemy, choosing for that Effect a place where all

<P>When an Army Encamps near an Enemy, and there be no River to divide them, the General of|tentimes Entrenches his Camp, and makes his men pass the night under Arms.</P>
<P>The Colonel, or Officer of Horse who Mounts the Guard, is to send off an Out-Guard, or Ad|vance-guard consisting of twenty four Troopers, Commanded by a Lieutenant, whom he Posts where he sees most convenient in a place from whence the Countrey about may be easily discove|red;</P>
<P>The Duty of him who commands the great Guard, is to let no person whatsoever pass without an Order, to look every where about, and to send Notice to the General whenever he discovers any Troop or Forces.</P>
<P>It is to be observed, that the measure of ground beforementioned, is meant only for En|camping of an Army, for if it were to be Ranged in Battle in case of Service, the distances between the Battalions or Squadrons are to be greater than in a Camp. It must be endeavoured as much as may be, that the second <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ne be equal to the first, keeping the same distance upon the Right and Left.</P>

<P>Advancing against the Enemy in Battel out of Musket-shot, the Captains and other Officers at the head of the Battalion are all to March in a Line with their pikes in their hands two good paces before the men, and are often to look behind them, because other|wise they may insensibly get too much before the body, and the Soldiers by following to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> fast, fall into Disorder, whereof great care is to be taken in marching against an Enemy.</P>
<P>When the Musketiers come within Shot, &amp; march ready with their Muskets guarded, the ranks should be closed forwards to Swords point; the Distance of Files is to be preserved, as hath been said already.</P>
<P>In a Battel, the Captains and other Officers are to march in a Line; but coming within Shot of the Enemy, and the Musketiers mar|ching ready Cockt and Guarded, when the first rank is commanded to kneel, the whole

line of Captains and other Officers is to Re|tire each of them into the Intervals of his Files next behind his Post, yet so that they may look to the right and left of the Battali|on.</P>
<P>The Offier commanding the Rere, is to ob|serve that the Battalion keep marching, to cause the Soldiers to close forwards easily with|out noise or confusion. His chief care is, to command the pikes to march always even with the wings of Shot; for it often happens that in marching any considerable time in Battel, the Wings advance, and form a half Moon, so that the pikes in the middle being extreamly pressed upon, the Battalion falls into confusion; but provided the motion of the pikes be equal with the Right and Left, the Battalion cannot be disordered in its March. Above all, care must be taken to preserve the distance in rank and File, according to what has been said already.</P>

<HEAD>Of Garrisons and Guards.</HEAD>
<P>THe Officers usually placed in a Garrison, are a Governour, a Lieutenant Governour, a Ma|jor, Aid-Major, and Captains of the Gates.</P>
<P>It is the Governours part to have a continual care of the preservation of the Place intrusted to him. His Office is to appoint the Guards, Rounds, and Patrols, to give the word every evening, visit the Posts, keep the Officers and and Soldiers to their Duty, charge them to be diligent, and to send out frequent Parties as well to learn News of the Ene|my, as to raise contributions from the Neighbour|ing Countrey.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant Governour, or Officer in chief commands in the place and Government in absence of the Governour, with the same Authority.</P>
<P>The Major sees the Guards mounted, the Rounds and Posts assigned, he regulates the Centinels, goes
<PB N="154" REF="000508_0153_0FA6A839F9654878">
every evening to receive the word from the Go|vernour, and gives it about upon the place of Arms, to the Quartermasters and Sargeants of the Garri|son. He goes his Round Major, visits the Corps of Guards, and sees that all the Soldiers Arms are fixt and in good order; he causes necessary Ammu|nition to be distributed among them, orders the Gates to be opened and shut, and gives the Gover|nour an exact account of all that passes in the place</P>
<P>The Aid Majors are more or less in number, ac|cording to the greatness of Places; They go the Rounds with the Major by turns, and the Duty of their Places differs nothing at all from his, they being as Assistants to him.</P>
<P>The Care of the Captains of the Gates is to go Evening and Morning to the Governours House, to receive the keys of the Gates, that they may o|pen and shut them.</P>
<P>There is usually in every Garrison (especially a Frontier Town) a Commissary of Artillery, a Store-keeper who keeps account of all the Ammu|nition, and distributes it according to the Gover|nours, order, a certain number of Gunners, where|of there is always to be one on the Guard at the Batteries, a Commissary of Provisions who hath the charge of the Corn, Flower, and all that may serve font be Sustenance of a Garrison.</P>
<P>The Officers who are in a Garrison, owe all O|bedience and Respect to the Governour or Com|mander in chief, and they cannot be absent for a|ny reason soever, without a permission from him
<PB N="155" REF="000508_0154_0FA6A83AB8E43D50">
in Writing or from the Person that commands there in his absence.</P>
<P>In Garrison, some men are to be placed at the Gates, whose care is only to observe Strangers that come in and go out, and according to the com|paring the Memorials which they and all the Inn|keepers of the Town are to bring every evening to the Major; it is known how many Strangers are every night in the place, what they are, and where they Lodge.</P>
<P>The hour of mounting the Guard is different in Garrisons, according to the inclination of the Go|varnours; in some places it is done at the break of day, because at the time when the Gates are open|ed (which is the usual hour of Surprizes). Two Thirds of the Garrison are in Arms; others mount it at ten of the Clock in the Forenoon, or towards the Evening; but the most usual time is at two of the Clock in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>Whilst the Drums beat for the Guard, the Sarge|ants or Corporals are to go to the Major's House, who makes them cast Lots for the Posts &amp; Rounds and writes them down in a Register kept for that purpose.</P>
<P>Having done so, they return to their Companies or Squadrons, who gather together before the Cap|tains Quarters, and if they do not mount by whole Companies, but by Detached men (which is the most practicable way of doing Duty) the Sarge|ants Lead them in good order, Drams beating as far as the place of Arms, to that part where the

<P><HI>When all the Detachments are Drawn up on the place of Arms formed ready for the Guards, the Major or Aid-major makes the Officers draw Lots for the Posts and Rounds, beginning by the Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ains, and ending at the Sargeants.</HI></P>
<P>At the places which are weakest, and where <HI>there</HI> is greatest danger, there ought to be a stronger Guard commanded by a Captain, with a Sub-Lieu|tenant or Ensign, and two or three Sargeants.</P>
<P>The Guards being Set, and the Officces having taken their posts, the Major begins to make the Guard of the place of Arms (or the main guard) march off, then those of the Gates and Bastions: and lastly, those that are without.</P>
<P><HI>Whilst the Guard is mounting, the Officers of the Guard that is to be Relieved, put their Soldiers in Arms and draw from the Guard, that they may leave the Place to the Guard that is to Relieve them, and Post themselves over against them, every Officer standing in his Post at the Head of them.</HI></P>
<P>The Officers of the Guard that is Relieved De|livers to them whatever orders there are, the Cor|porals do the like to their Comrades, they charge them with the Furniture of the Corps of Guard, and inform them of the number of Sentinels that are to be set, as well by night as by day, and of what they have to do extraordinary.</P>

<P>When a Stranger on Horseback or Foot, offers to come into the Town, the Out-Sentinels are to stop him, then to call the Corporal, who gives no|tice of it to the Officer, and the Officer send one or two Musketiers with him to the Governours House.</P>

<P>After the Gates are shut, one half of the Guard is to be drawn upon the Rampart to pass the night in the Corps of Guard of the Curtains or Bastions. The Corporals send some Soldiers for Firing and Candle, and the Sargeants go to the place of Arms to receive the Word, which is no sooner given but the Sargeants of the Guard carry the Word to their Officers and give it about among the Corporals who command the Sentinels to suffer no body after that time to pass upon the Ramparts without com|manding them to Stand, and giving Notice of it to the Corps of Guard.</P>
<P>The <HI>Taptoe</HI> or Retreat is beaten either at Nine or Ten, as the Governour directs.</P>

<P>All Governours or Commanders in chief ought to have a Sentinel at their Door, and as often as they pass by any Corps of Guard the Officers are obliged to draw out their Soldiers before the guard in a rank without Arms and stand at their Head.</P>
<P>I<HI>f the Governour or Commander of a Place be a Lieu|tenant General, he is to have a Guard at his door con|sisting of a Lieutenant, Sargeant and thirty men who are to be under Arms as well as the other Corps of Guard every time he passes, but the Drums are not to Beat the March.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If the Commander of a Place be a General, he is to have a Guard of fifty men commanded by a Captain, a Lieutenant, a Sub-Lieutenant or an Ensign and two Sargeants, and all Corps of Guard are obliged to be un|der Arms when he passes, and the Drums to beat the March.</HI></P>
<P>When any Prince of the Blood, or General of an Army passes through a Garrison, the Governour furnishes them with a Foot-guard; and at their Entry and Departure Salute them with Cannon.</P>

<P>T<HI>He Officers are to take gneat care that their Soldiers keep themselves cleanly and handsome in their clothes, as well as their Arms in good Order. It being as much the Duty of an Officer to see that a Soldiers clothes, and shoes and stockins be as they ought to be, as their Arms and especially upon Mounting of Guards or coming upon Duty, they are to see that they have every thing in order.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Captains of Foot, Lieutenants and Ensignes are to wear their Gorgets whenever they are up|on Duty, or appear in Arms with their Com|panies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tis very necessary for all captains and Commanders of Companies to practise their Muske|tiers to Exercise Pikes, and their Pikemen Muskets: As also to practise their men to shoot at a Mark, which is extream useful.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tis too be observed that in Marching a Batta|lion
<PB N="164" REF="000508_0163_0FA6A842F95B6D08">
in three Divisions, the Distances between the Divisions be neither too great nor too little, The best Rule for which is the judgment of the Officers to keep just so much Distance between the Divisi|ons as is necessary to Wheel a Division to make good the Front as if you were to draw up on a sudden.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In marching by Subdivisions also the same me|thod is best for the Distances between every Di|vision.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No Sentinel or Soldier under Arms is to bow or to pull off his Hat.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is likewise to be observed, that when the Pikes or Muskets of a Body of men are all Order|ed, and that they be to Shoulder their Muskets and Advance their Pikes, the Musketiers to be Commanded to Poise and Shoulder their Muskets before the Pikes are to Advance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When Officers are at any time to be Divided and Posted, It is to be done by the Odd and e|ven as the most easie war.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Upon Detachments or Parties all Officers of Horse are to command according to the Dates of their Commissions, and all Officers of Foot accord|ing to the Ranks of their Regi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nts. and not ac|cording to their Commissions, but the Lieutenants and Ensigns of the same Regiment upon such De|tachments or Parties are to command among them|selves
<PB N="165" REF="000508_0164_0FA6A843B8DB05F0">
according to their Commissions and not the Rank of their Companies</HI></P>
<P><HI>In Marching off any Parade or Place where men are drawn up, the Pikes are to continue advanced till they have marched clear of the place of Arms, the like is to be observed when a Body of men are to draw up, or that they march before any Person that comes to view them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No Soldiers are to march with any Coats on their arms or sticks in their hands, or any thing to incumber them.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of Councels of War, or Courts Martial.</HEAD>
<P>I<HI>N an Army the Councel of War is always to meet at at the Generals Quarters or Tent, and none are cal|led to it but the Lieutenant Generals, the Major Gene|ral, the Brigadiers, and the Colonels or Commanders of Bodies when the matters concern their Regiments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Private Councels of War or Courts Martial in a Garrison are either held at the Governours House, at the main guard, or where the Governour orders. In a Camp, at the Colonels Tent, who causes Notice to be given to the Captains to be present.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When all are met, the Governour or Colonel, or he who is to sit as President, takes his place at the head of the Table, the Captains sit about according to their Seni|ority (that is to say) the first Captain on the right hand of him that presides, the second on the left, and so of the rest. And the Town Major or the aid major or Quarter Master of the Regiment, who in the absence of the Judge-advocate discharges his Offices is to sit in his Place at the lower end of the Table.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="000508_0165_0FA6A844DE1779D8">
The Lieutenants, Sub-Lieutenants and En-Ensigns have right to enter into the Room where the Council of War (or Marshal) is held, But they are to stand at the Cap|tains backs with their Hatts off, and have no Vote.</P>
<P>If the Councel be called to Deliberate on some matter of consequence, the President having opened it to the Court, Asks their O|pinions,</P>
<P>The youngest Officer gives his Opinion first, and the rest in order till it come to the President, who speaks last. The Opinions of every one being set down in Writing, the Result is drawn conformable to the Plurality of Votes which is Signed by the President only.</P>
<P>If the Councel of War, or Court Martial be held to judge a Criminal, the President and Cap|tains having taken their places, and the Prisoner be|ing brought before them, and the informations read the President interrogates the prisoner about the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">cts whereof he is accused, and having heard his Defence, and the proof made or alledged against him, he is ordered to withdraw, being remitted to the Care of the Martial or Jaylor. Then every one Judges according to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Conscience and the Ordinances or Articles of War; the Sentence is framed according to the Plurality of Votes, and the Criminal being brought in again, the Sentence is
<PB N="167" REF="000508_0166_0FA6A8476F323EB0">
pronounced to him in the Name of the Councel of War, or Court Martial.</P>
<P>When a Criminal is condemned to any Punish|ment, the Provost Martial causes the Sentence to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> put in execution, and if it be a publick puinishment the Regiment ought to be drawn together to see it, that thereby the Soldiers may be deterred from of|fending. Before a Soldier be punished foy any infamous Crime, he is to be publickly degraded from his Arms and his Coats stript over his ears.</P>
<P><HI>A Councel of Warr or Court Martial is to consist of Seven at least with the President, when so many Offi|cers can be brought together: and if it so happen that there be not Captains enough to make up that number, the inferiour Officers may be called in.</HI></P>
