<HEAD>ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>EVER happy in obeying the requests of my fellow citizens, and inspired with the gen|eral joy on this glorious anniversary, I hope to be indulged with candour in stepping aside from the duties of my profession, and assuming the attitude of a public speaker; tho conscious of my own unworthiness to ascend this sacred rostrum.</P>
<P>IT has been the laudable practice of all na|tions, to commemorate important national events: And there is an affecting propriety in keeping this joyful festival&mdash;<HI>the birth-day of Liberty</HI>&mdash;the SAB|BATH of Freedom!&mdash;It brings to our minds the
<PB N="8" REF="033672_0005_0FF7C6EA4EA4AC28">
exploits of our fathers and brethren; raises from the dead the honoured shades of those who bled in the <HI>sacred cause,</HI> all decorated with immortal laurel, and exalts our affectionate gratitude to the ONE SUPREME, who granted this infant country his holy protection through a red-sea of blood and carnage&mdash;a wilderness of intestine machinations, to this blessed Canaan of national dignity and glory.</P>
<P>THIS completes the twenty second year since the assembled wisdom of these then colonies, dared assume a rank among the nations, and solemnly appealed to the God of justice, to support them in their struggle to defend the Rights of Man: He heard their prayer, and was pleased to crown their exertions with the most abundant success.</P>
<P>NEVER was a time when there was a greater propriety in calling to mind the price of liberty, than at the present eventful crisis! Let us then turn back the pages of memory to '75. See the chains formed by a foreign nation, ready to shackle every free-born American: The plains of Lexington, and the bloody heights of Charles|town, call us to remember the gloomy hour! The
<PB N="9" REF="033672_0006_0FF7C6DEAD92EE60">
pale ghost of WARREN rises to our view and de|clares in more than mortal accents, I BLED FOR YOU! Venerable PRESCOTT looks from his peace|ful grave, and calls us to our duty! MONTGOM|ERY'S bones, and M'PHERSON'S blood, from dis|tant Quebec, tell us to beware of foreign chains. The long list of heroes who bled in New-York, White-plains and Saratoga, conjure us by the price of their sacred lives, to remember their death with gratitude. But here let us pause&mdash;for from this period is dated the source of our present danger.</P>
<P>WHEN France beheld with astonishment a whole army fall a sacrifice to American bravery, she, for the first time, dared to aid the cause of the oppressed. Her breast on fire with hatred to England&mdash;a hatred which had been fed by eternal wars and bloodshed; she thought this her time to be revenged on her mortal foe: the alliance was formed, and Britain was humbled. But how?&mdash;Brave GREEN, were there any French|men with you at Guilford and Eutaw springs? No&mdash;all were freemen: 'tis true they were at York Town, but only looked on to see their ene|mies conquered to their hand. But allowing them ever so much credit, were they not as
<PB N="10" REF="033672_0007_0FF78391C9EE09B8">
much interested as we? and had we ever the smallest fraction from them which we have not honourably repaid even before the time stipulated by contract? Why then do we hear long <HI>fallal</HI> of American ingratitude?&mdash;Heaven was our friend, and was pleased in mercy to bring about a peace founded on the most advantageous principles to this country; and to Heaven let clouds of grateful incense rise!</P>
<P>NEVER 'till the forming the treaty of 1783 did the truth shew itself, and French policy, or rather perfidy appear. Our ADAMS, our JAY, and the manes of the venerable FRANKLIN, can testify that the French minister insisted upon the independence of the States not being laid as the basis of the treaty; and that our plenipotentiaries should relinquish all claim to some of the most im|portant sources of national wealth&mdash;the fishery for one! Did this look like that disinterested friend|ship which her emissaries in this country have harped upon as a reason why we should give up to France our all, and become her tributaries?</P>
<P>FROM the first formation of the French mon|archy it has been necessary for the neighbouring
<PB N="11" REF="033672_0008_0FF7C722151D2E90">
States to league together to prevent her overbear|ing power from destroying the balance of Europe, and becoming like ancient Rome, the tyrant of the world. Her LEWISES, her HENRY'S and all the long catalogue of <HI>grand monarques,</HI> from CHAR|LEMAGNE to LEWIS XVIth. have kept in view, but never been able to effect any other purpose than by perpetual wars to impoverish the kingdom and lesson the liberty of the subject, 'till the immense weight of debt, and unbounded luxury of a profli|gate Court, precipitated her into a revolution, and down tumbled the hereditary throne with all its grim apendages of racks and bastiles, to the ground!&mdash;Here America shouted from the heart, <HI>long live the Republic of France!</HI></P>
<P>SCARCELY a man on this side the water then dreamed that from the ashes of the ancient monar|chy, could arise a Phoenix which should pursue the same diabolical policy. But what do facts say? See her banishing from her territory every one who retains a single wish of justice towards her allies. Oh! FAYETTE, too valuable a sacrifice at this black shrine! And lest honesty or virtue should again shew themselves in any form, see her spurn|ing from her every vestige of the sacred religion
<PB N="12" REF="033672_0009_0FF7C72589825380">
of Heaven, and tyrannizing with a high hand over the neighboring States, whom, by the most solemn acts of national faith, she had promised to protect. Such have been her amazing exertions in the vile project of universal domination, that the only barrier now left, is the powerful English marine, which has hitherto confined her to the continent, and fire and devastation from over|spreading the world.</P>
<P>Now, to convince every mind unprejudiced with party heat or secret gold, that France has formed the same horrid designs against this happy asylum of true liberty, let us only look at what she has done.&mdash;<HI>Divide and govern,</HI> has uniformly been her maxim: She first ferments cabals and parties, to weaken the power she intends to attack; then sends her bloody myrmidons to aid the faction, and thus carries her point: witness Hol|land, Spain, Venice, and in fact every nation which has yet felt her horrid chains!</P>
<P>LET us look at home. When peace with her charming train, revisited these smiling realms, America found herself encumbered with a serious debt, with no other method to lessen it but direct
<PB N="13" REF="033672_0010_0FF7C727E31287E8">
taxation: The compact which held the States together, went no farther than recommendation without any coercive power to oblige the different States to pay their equal proportion of the public demand. Public danger no longer operated as a stimulus. Uneasiness was the immediate conse|quence, which in some places ran into high handed insurrection. Heaven had by this time furnished us with a great number of worthies, who to a sincere love of their country, added profound wis|dom and knowledge in the great science of civil government. They saw the necessity of a more energetic band of union between the States; and brought about a Convention for the great purpose of forming a national Constitution. Accordingly the May of 1787, saw assembled at Philadelphia, all the greatest abilities of this extensive continent.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON, who, like himself, for he has no equal on the page of history, four years before had peaceably resigned the command of the army, and retired with his <HI>forest</HI> of laurels and the blessings of his countrymen, to his farm at Mount Vernon, was called to the head of this au|gust assembly; and, pardon me in saying, the
<PB N="14" REF="033672_0011_0FF7C729C757E200">
Great GOD of order and peace Himself, conde|scended to direct the momentous business. The result was a Constitution, justly esteemed, the won|der of the world.</P>
<P>BUT here an interesting scene is opened to the view of all united America. The sublime task was complete, but it remained to be ratified by the separate States; and strange to tell, in ten of the fourteen it met with the most formidable oppo|sition. Whether this opposition was in any wise indebted to French influence, I will not pretend to decide: But when we reflect that the most violent opposers of the Constitution have shewn themselves the warm partizans of France, ever since, have we not good reason to suspect that she had her wily serpents concealed even at that early period? Notwithstanding all endeavors to the contrary, the glorious fabric was supported, by the whole fourteen pillars; and Heaven grant it may be coeval with the everlasting hills.</P>
<P>WEALTH soon began now to flow into our country, and every tide has since brought us the rich productions of every climate; and the conse|quence
<PB N="15" REF="033672_0012_0FF7C72B5CA41F70">
of this great national compact has been a rise of respectability and increase of resource be|yond the most sanguine calculations.&mdash;The great WASHINGTON, who by the unanimous voice of his grateful countrymen, had been called to the presidential chair, foresaw that in the bloody con|flict in Europe, both parties would be anxious to draw us in for a partner in the war, wisely de|termined to observe the most impartial neutrality; though not till we had come forward, acknowl|edged the republic of France, and received her ambassador.</P>
<P>THE British government, yet sore at her dis|appointment respecting these States, had never fulfilled the treaty, and now began to prey upon our commerce. This was the very wish of France; thinking that the same vindictive policy, which, on similar occasions, had ever disgraced the Cabi|nets of Europe, would be followed by us, left no art unpractised to blow up the flame, and drive us into a situation where we had nothing to gain, but on the other hand every thing to loose. But our government, with a superior wisdom and pru|dence, had recourse to peaceful negociation; settled all differences in an amicable way, and our
<PB N="16" REF="033672_0013_0FF7C72E38D2A568">
envoy returned with a commercial treaty more honorable and advantageous than England was ever known to grant to any nation on earth.</P>
<P>BEFORE this, France, by her infamous emis|aries, had established a strong party in these States, which now howled from St. Croix to the Missi|sippi. All those who had opposed the Federal Constitution joined the vile clamour and the disaf|fected Editors of news-papers poured forth tor|rents of abuse against WASHINGTON and the gov|ernment.</P>
<P>GENET, the French ambassador, some time before this, did not scruple openly to insult our government in the most infamous manner, upon his first arrival; and instructed to convert us to the vile purposes of France, he organised the op|position into clubs, upon the plan of the French jacobin societies. who now assumed the titles of THE PEOPLE&mdash;EXCLUSIVE PATRIOTS&mdash;and a train of arrogant epithets, too conceited to enumerate; and false and imposing as they were arrogant and conceited. But GENET'S conduct could not be suffered, and the PRESIDENT obtained his recal: but instead of returning to France, he had the
<PB N="17" REF="033672_0014_0FF7C731B1A04CC8">
address to connect himself with a conspicuous fam|ily in New-York, where from a public minister, he sank into a private declaimer against the gov|ernment, to carry into farther execution the plans he had laid while in office. Was this part of the design of his mission?&mdash;<HI>"We are adebts at intrigue,"</HI> say the French of themselves. If it was so, how far below contempt are such base means to injure a people whose greatest error was then a too generous attachment to France and her infatua|ted leaders.</P>
<P>NEXT came FAUCHET. Just the same plans are pursued: Bribery and corruption&mdash;declama|tions to the people against their elective govern|ment&mdash;extending the old policy of <HI>divide and rule,</HI> by every practicable mean. Jacobins grow more and more insolent; and had it not been for the British treaty which arrested their vile career, and put honest men upon thinking, God alone knows where the horrid drama would have closed.&mdash;At length, full freighted with <HI>precious confessions,</HI> and Jacobin adulation, home he went, and ADET reigned in his stead. He just the same, but in|structed to be more circumspect, went on to lecture his dear disorganizing brethren, till almost every
<PB N="18" REF="033672_0015_0FF7C6DC245D8E18">
scoundrel through the Union had learnt the horrid lesson to blaspheme the christian religion, and condemn the American administration, without distinction of persons or measures.</P>
<P>EVERY arrival from France announced some shocking act of cruelty&mdash;some unheard of scene of savage brutality!&mdash;Yet France is right&mdash;hund|dreds of innocent women and children murdered in an hour&mdash;all right, all good&mdash;all just as it ought to be: But on the other hand, the most important and beneficial acts of our own govern|ment must of consequence be loaded with all the execration which calumny and slander with their forked tongues can utter.</P>
<P>OUR commerce is now attacked by a herd of pirates! Yet our immaculate clubists pronounce all right; and what is worse, they acted the same part towards France, which the tories did towards England, previous to the late war: made them believe that nothing was wanting but a few threats to frighten us into a compliance with any demand which their insatiable avarice might prompt them to make.&mdash;<HI>"The terrible Republic!</HI>&mdash;the negroes will be all armed and sent to ravage
<PB N="19" REF="033672_0016_0FF7C73339624AD8">
the States from one end to the other!" with a thousand other bugbears, were in constant circula|tion from their presses, those sinks of falshood and abuse!</P>
<P>AT this critical moment came on our election of PRESIDENT; and what rendered it a complete touch-stone, General WASHINGTON in a letter to the whole of his great family of America, had re|signed his pretensions to a new choice, and the two candidates were of opposite parties. Here again we see France, in her base insidious way, using every method to mislead that independent spirit which ever ought to direct our elections of supreme magistrate. It was said, if ADAMS is chosen our allies will be offended, and resent the inattention to their wishes!&mdash;What business, in the name of liberty, has any foreign nation to have any wishes, or influence, or care about our internal policy?&mdash;The very thought brings a glow of resentment into every independent bosom, and crimsons every cheek with honest indignation!&mdash;We felt it. The election was happily closed, and ADAMS, the dignified philosopher&mdash;the firm, unshaken patriot the great experienced civilian&mdash;the hearty chris|stian&mdash;ADAMS, is our PRESIDENT; and all true
<PB N="20" REF="033672_0017_0FF7C6E38049BEE8">
friends to their country may justly glory in his open, dignified, decided administration.</P>
<P>FRENCH depredations increased:&mdash;their cruis|ers, regardless of the solemn stipulations of na|tional compacts, seize our property with a high hand! Our government sends over Envoys with the olive branch:&mdash;let us try peaceful negocia|tion, said the PRESIDENT; but what has been the consequence? In the first place&mdash;vile temporising, under the wing of the very Directory!&mdash;unpardon|able delays&mdash;"give us a bribe&mdash;we cannot re|ceive you without a bribe!&mdash;money&mdash;money&mdash;money, must open the door to peaceful negociation!&mdash;You give the Indians money&mdash;you give the bar|barians money&mdash;why not us?"&mdash;Is this the most refined, the most polished nation in Europe!&mdash;Is it France who says this to her only ally, from whom she has already robbed fifteen millions? Oh how fallen!&mdash;ill fated land, to bear on thy bosom a government capable of such baseness! and that too in the midst of the most splendid triumphs!!!</P>
<P>FINALLY an answer is demanded. The French minister, TALLEYRAND, is ordered to give it:&mdash;But how pitiful&mdash;how evasive&mdash;how childish!
<PB N="21" REF="033672_0018_0FF7C6E110ECC768">
&mdash;Americans, it was only meant for an imposition upon your populace! something for your Auroras&mdash;your Chronicles&mdash;your secret enemies&mdash;your jacobin clubs, to clamour and prate about, yet to cajole you, if possible to your destruction! This too was translated in France, and sent to GENET and the printers of inflamatory papers so as to be sure to make the first impression: But this will do good, for it proves beyond a doubt that there has ever been a party under French influence, to divide that they may ruin us.</P>
<P>LET us look for a moment to the consequence of such influence and division in the old world.&mdash;What could be more flattering than the manner in which the Venetian ambassador was received by the Directory? and what could more strongly express absolute assurance of protection and friend|ship, than their answer at an open public audience?&mdash;The next news we hear Venice is robbed of every dollar&mdash;of every moveable, even to her an|cient Museum, and then vilely sold to the emperor.</P>
<P>SWITZERLAND now rises all bloody to our view!=She too had listened to the same vile flat|teries, and slept in fatal security till she heard the
<PB N="22" REF="033672_0019_0FF7C6E8C7D29810">
thunder of French cannon at her very gates, when she awoke only to see her great and good men butchered! her people slain by thousands! her fertile fields laid waste! her cities plundered! and her liberty and independence swept away in the dreadful deluge, and sunk to rise no more!</P>
<P>MY friends, you here see a picture of French faith and fraternity, in their true light, though but saintly drawn.</P>
<P>OUR PRESIDENT now stands firm at his post:&mdash;arm, arm, he commands!&mdash;arm, arm, we echo from Georgia to Maine. We will not be duped! We hear the shrieks of matrons and old men butchered&mdash;of virgins ravished&mdash;of infants dashed against the wall!&mdash;We wrested from the jaws of the British Lion our invaded rights: and we are ready to defend them from the talons of the Gallic Vultures!&mdash;Let us stand up as one man, rally round our head, and declare to France and all the world, that we will never barter our well|organized Government for their despotic confu|sion&mdash;our trial by jury, for their secret daggers or open guillotines&mdash;our holy sabbath and heavenly religion, for their sceptic decade and hellish
<PB N="23" REF="033672_0020_0FF7C734C5739970">
atheism!&mdash;We appeal to that GOD they have defyed&mdash;and may He, in infinite mercy, strengthen our resolution and take us under his holy pro|tection.</P>
