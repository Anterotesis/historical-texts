<P><HI>WHereas the</HI> Lawes <HI>Publi&s;hed by the</HI> Honoured General Court, <HI>Lib.</HI> 1. <HI>Pag.</HI> 76. <HI>Sect.</HI> 3. Do Require all Townes from time to time to di&s;po&s;e of Single Per&s;ons and inmates within their Towns to Service, or otherwi&s;e. And in <HI>Pag.</HI> 16. <HI>Tit. Children and Youth,</HI> It is Required of the Select men, That they &s;ee that all Children and Youth under family Government, be taught to Read perfectly the Engli&s;h Tongue, have knowledge of the Capital Lawes, and be taught &s;ome Orthodox Catechi&s;me, and that they be brought up to &s;ome hone&s;t imployment profitable to them&s;elves and the Common Wealth, and in ca&s;e of neglect on the part of the family Governours, after Admonition given them, the &s;aid Select men are Required with the help of two Magi&s;trates, or next Court of that Shire, to take &s;uch Children or Apprentices from them, and place them forth with &s;uch as will look more &s;trictly to them.</P>
<P><HI>The neglect whereof, as by &s;ad experience from Court to Court aboundantly appeares, doth occa&s;ion much Sin and prophanes to encrea&s;e among us; to the di&s;hon|our of God, and the en&s;nareing of many Children and &s;ervants, by the di&s;&s;olute lives and practices of &s;uch as do live from under family Government, and is a great di&s;|couragement to tho&s;e family Governours who con&s;cientiou&s;ly endeavour to bring up their youth in all Chri&s;tian nurture as the Lawes of God and this Common Wealth doth require.</HI></P>
<P>THe&s;e are therefore in his <HI>Maje&s;ties Name</HI> to Require you to acquaint the Select men of your Town, that the Court doth expect and will Re|quire that the &s;aid Lawes be accordingly attended, the prevolency of the former neglect notwith&s;tanding. And you are al&s;o required to take a li&s;t of the names of all tho&s;e young per&s;ons within the bounds of your Town, who do live from under family Government, <HI>viz.</HI> do not &s;erve their Parents, or Ma&s;ters, as Children, Apprentices, hired Servants, or journey men, ought to do, and u&s;ually did in our Native Country; being &s;ubject to their Commands and Di&s;cipline: and the &s;ame you are to Returne to the next Court</P>
