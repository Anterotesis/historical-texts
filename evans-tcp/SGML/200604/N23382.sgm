<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the contempt in which you are held by Mr. Burke, and men like Mr. Burke, yet, as the following publication is calculated principally for your u&s;e and enter|tainment, I think it proper to dedicate it to you. Indeed, I &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e gentlemen, who, with their ari&s;tocracy of power, titles, wealth, places, pen&s;ions, &amp;c. conceive that they po&s;&s;e&s;s al&s;o an ari&s;tocracy of under&s;tanding, and that you were born only for their u&s;e, will not deign to ca&s;t their eyes on &s;o vulgar a performance. For the&s;e <HI>great</HI> men I write not; but if I can afford <HI>you</HI> any amu&s;ement or any in&s;truction, I &s;hall have accompli&s;hed my end.</P>
<P>It may be objected to the title of this pamphlet, that <HI>Tom Paine</HI> is no <HI>Je&s;ter</HI>&mdash;that his works con|tain <HI>&s;erious truths: but you,</HI> I am certain, will allow, that they contain <HI>many good things;</HI> and even his enemies (both tho&s;e formerly in power, and tho&s;e received into power and favour, for their oppo&s;ition to his doctrines, even Mr. Burke him&s;elf) mu&s;t confe&s;s, that they contain <HI>&s;mart things;</HI> for if the&s;e <HI>gentlemen-placemen</HI> had not <HI>&s;marted</HI> under them, we &s;hould not have &s;een the long li&s;t of pro&s;ecutions which have taken place again&s;t Mr. Paine and the book&s;ellers who &s;old his works. In &s;ome of the&s;e pro&s;ecutions the juries have found the books to be libels, and in others, the juries have found them not to be libels. This is what is called, in that equitable place, We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, the <HI>glorious uncertainty of the law.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="030952_0003_0FE9FD20B192D778">In the following &s;heets I have endeavoured to keep clear of any thing that may be the cau&s;e of my being honoured with the attention of that valuable officer of the <HI>Crown,</HI> the King's Attorney-General: but in the&s;e days, when lawyers a&s;&s;ert that truth is a libel our friend Tom Paine ob|&s;erves, that to &s;ay truth is a libel is a libel on truth), even this innocent performance may, by the rulers of the land, be con&s;idered as libellous, e&s;pecially as it is avowedly publi&s;hed for your u&s;e, and not for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who call them&s;elves learned men or great men.

<HEAD>JESTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A DROLL blunder was made in the Daily Adverti&s;er, in the month of May la&s;t. It &s;tated, that a bill was brought into parliament, to &s;ecure the rights of <HI>potentates,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>patentees.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The following notice was, for many months, adverti&s;ed on a board, at the Surry end of We&s;t|min&s;ter Bridge:&mdash;"<HI>Rubbi&s;h may be &s;hot by the di|rection of Thomas Paine.</HI>" It has been lately taken down, at the reque&s;t, it is &s;aid, of a <HI>Lord of the Bedchamber.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A gentleman (an enemy to <HI>anarchi&s;ts</HI>) lately ordered a gla&s;s of brandy in a coffee hou&s;e, adding, "Take care there is none of your damned <HI>French</HI> &s;tuff in it."&mdash;The waiter replied, "<HI>Genuine Bri|ti&s;h, Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you.</HI>"</P>
<P N="4">4. It was ob&s;erved, &s;ome time ago, in a mine&s;|terial new&s;paper, that 5000 Hanoverians were on their march, to <HI>increa&s;e</HI> the number of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> troops quartered at Tournay.</P>
<P N="5">5. When Lord Howe, in the month of Augu&s;t la&s;t, made the be&s;t of his way into port after he had <HI>got &s;ight</HI> of the French fleet, one of his officers,
<PB N="6" REF="030952_0005_0FE9FD2702715208">
not remarkably correct in his orthography, wrote to a corre&s;pondent, that he expected they would &s;oon go to SEE again.</P>
<P N="6">6. A workman, lately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his em|ployment at Manche&s;ter, was told at the &s;ame time, that the war was not the cau&s;e of his mis|fortune. "Now, to me (&s;ays the man bluffly) the ca&s;e appears directly contrary;&mdash;are we not at this moment employed in <HI>&s;hooting our cu&s;tom|ers?</HI>"</P>
<P N="7">7. Some wags in Dublin lately gave informa|tion to a magi&s;trate, that a Mr. Scanlon had three <HI>mortars</HI> in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The magi&s;trate, attended by a party of dragoons, &s;urrounded the hou&s;e, and demanded the <HI>mortars</HI> to be delivered to him in the name of the King. Mr. Scanlon, who is a re&s;pectable apothecary, immediately produced them, adding, that as they were u&s;ele&s;s without the <HI>pe&s;tles,</HI> the&s;e were al&s;o at his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P N="8">8. At a late Kent a&s;&s;izes, an action was brought for &s;lander, in which an attorney was plaintiff, and an hone&s;t farmer defendant. The action was brought to recover damages, for calling the at|torney a <HI>rogue</HI> and a <HI>thief.</HI> The verdict of the ju|ry was, that <HI>as the plaintiff was an attorney, the action did not lie.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. Soon after Mr. Dundas's late marriage, a per&s;on ob&s;erved that he wondered that gentleman held &s;o many offices, for that he imagined it would be enough for him to do the <HI>duties</HI> of the <HI>home department.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. An Iri&s;h officer had the misfortune to be dreadfully wounded in one of the battles in Ame|rica la&s;t war. As he lay on the ground, an un|fortunate &s;oldier, who was near him, and was al|lo &s;everely wounded, made a terrible howling; when the officer exclaimed, "<HI>Damn your eyes,
<PB N="7" REF="030952_0006_0FE9FD290497CBE8">
what do you make &s;uch a noi&s;e for? Do you think there is nobody killed but your&s;elf?</HI>"</P>
<P N="11">11. The Fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty, out of compliment to his talents, is commonly called in the office the <HI>late</HI> Lord Chatham.</P>
<P N="12">12. In an old church hi&s;tory, we meet with the following curious article: "The church of Witham Friary is a &s;mall &s;tructure &s;upported by a <HI>nave.</HI>"</P>
<P N="13">13. His Grace of Richmond being a&s;ked, why he ordered a captain's guard to mount in the kitch|en? replied, that he wi&s;hed to accu&s;tom the cap|tains of militia to <HI>&s;tand fire.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. Some time ago a gentleman in Devon&s;hire thought he could not give a greater proof of his loyalty, than by employing a number of per&s;ons to burn Tom Paine in effigy. At the conclu&s;ion, one of the fellows waited on him, to know if there was any other <HI>gemman</HI> among his friends, whom he would wi&s;h to have burned, as they were ready to do it for the &s;ame quantity of beer.</P>
<P N="15">15. A royal publican in Saint George's fields adverti&s;es his hou&s;e by the title of <HI>the Prince&s;s Royal's Tap.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. During the riots in 1780, &s;everal per&s;ons, in order to &s;ave their hou&s;es, wrote on their doors '<HI>no popery.</HI>' Grimaldi, the dancer, to avoid all mi&s;takes, wrote on his, '<HI>no religion.</HI>'</P>
<P N="17">17. One of Mr. Reeves's men was lately ha|ranguing the people, in a barn in the country, on the ble&s;&s;ings of our con&s;titution, our paucity of taxes, &amp;c. When an a&s;s, who had borne many <HI>heavy burdens,</HI> in the mid&s;t of the oration, put his head in at the window and began a braying. The company &s;eeming divided in their attention be|tween the two orators, a wag ob&s;erved, <HI>only one at a time, if you plea&s;e, gentlemen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>HISTORICAL REMARKS, ANECDOTES, OBSERVATIONS, BON MOTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P N="18">18. The oath of allegiance (&s;ays Algernon Sid|ney) binds no private man to more than the law directs; and has no influence upon the whole bo|dy of the nation. Many princes are known to their &s;ubjects only by the injuries, lo&s;&s;es, and mi&s;|chiefs they bring upon them. Rebellion it&s;elf is neither good nor bad more than any other war; but is ju&s;t or unju&s;t, according to the manner of it.</P>
<P N="19">19. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;tretches that have been lately made as to libels, it is hardly credible, but it is certainly true, that a man was lately ar|re&s;ted in Dublin as a libeller, for &s;hewing a print of Mr. Paine to &s;ome people around him.</P>
<P N="20">20. Dragonetti, in his Treati&s;e on Virtues and Rewards, has a paragraph worthy of being re|corded in every country in the world:&mdash;"The &s;cience (&s;ays he) of the politician con&s;i&s;ts in fixing the true point of happine&s;s and freedom: Tho&s;e men would de&s;erve the gratitude of ages who &s;hould di&s;cover a mode of government that con|tained the greate&s;t &s;um of individual happine&s;s, with the lea&s;t national expen&s;e."</P>
<P N="21">21. "Put a country right (&s;ays Mr. Paine), and it will &s;oon put goverment right."</P>
<P N="22">22. "For a nation to be free (&s;ay the French) it is &s;ufficient that &s;he wills it."</P>
<P N="23"><PB N="9" REF="030952_0008_0FE9FD359D9CC7B0">23. Almo&s;t immediately after Dr. John&s;on's tract, entitled <HI>Taxation no Tyranny,</HI> appeared in America, it was an&s;wered by one, called <HI>Re&s;i&s;|tance no Rebellion.</HI></P>
<P N="24">24. The fir&s;t time that Mr. Pitt went to Cam|bridge after his election for the univer&s;ity, all the <HI>&s;ophs</HI> were (as might be expected) gaping for <HI>lawn &s;leeves,</HI> and the other good things in the gift of their repre&s;entative. Dr. Paley preached before the young mini&s;ter, from the following text; <HI>There is a lad here, which hath five borley loaves and two &s;mall fi&s;hes, but what are they among &s;o many?</HI></P>
<P N="25">25. Tom Paine &s;ays, truth hath this advantage over prejudice, that truth cannot be unlearned.</P>
<P N="26">26. The late Mr. Flood, once talking of the Iri&s;h pen&s;ion li&s;t, &s;aid, it might be compared to <HI>death,</HI> for it was the <HI>wages of &s;in.</HI></P>
<P N="27">27. <HI>Parliamentary Reform.</HI>&mdash;On this &s;ubject it was mentioned that a noble lord had got the rever|&s;ion of a borough, at the end of twenty years. A great lord, who was pre&s;ent pertinently a&s;ked, "<HI>What any borough would be worth twenty years hence?</HI>"</P>
<P N="28">28. Soon after the capture of the Spani&s;h re|gi&s;ter &s;hip, a recruiting &s;erjeant of marines at Man|che&s;ter, after expatiating on the number of <HI>gal|leons,</HI> that were taken, informed his audience, that be&s;ides the king's bounty, every two men &s;hould be provided with a <HI>large</HI> che&s;t, having a &s;trong partition to hold their <HI>prize money.</HI></P>
<P N="29">29. A print&s;eller in Dublin, lately had the au|dacity to expo&s;e for &s;ale, a print of the &mdash;, with the following lines from Pope's Homer underneath:</P>
<L>"Cur&s;t is the man, and void of law and right,</L>
<L>"Unworthy property, unworthy light,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="030952_0009_0FE9FD926B700A78">"Unfit for public rule or private care,</L>
<L>"That wretch, that mon&s;ter, who delights in war:</L>
<L>"Who&s;e lu&s;t is murder, and who&s;e horrid joy,</L>
<L>"To tear his country, and his kind de&s;troy."</L>
<P N="30">30. Henry the Seventh, on his death-bed &s;aid, "I have left my &s;ubjects a legacy: I have left them, <HI>peace,</HI> the be&s;t legacy a prince can leave his people." <HI>Some kings</HI> might parody this &s;peech, u&s;ing the word <HI>debt</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>peace,</HI> and &s;ub&s;ti|tuting <HI>wor&s;t</HI> for <HI>be&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="31">31. It is an ob&s;ervation of a French author, that there is no example of an Engli&s;h mini&s;ter who began a war, continuing in office till its con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="32">32. The ob&s;ervation of Mr. Paine, that Eng|land has no con&s;titution, is not new. Something very like it is contained in the following pa&s;&s;age from the <HI>courtly</HI> Hume's Hi&s;tory of England. "Tho&s;e (&s;ays he) who, from a pretended re&s;pect to antiquity, appeal, at every turn, to an original plan of the con&s;titution, only cover their turbulent &s;pirit, and their private ambition, under the ap|pearance of venerable forms; and whatever period, they pitch on for their model, they may &s;till be carried back to a more di&s;tant period, where they will find the mea&s;ures of power entirely different, and where every circum&s;tance, by rea&s;on of the greater barbarity of the times, will &s;till appear le&s;s worthy of imitation. Above all, a civilized na|tion, like the Engli&s;h, ought to be cautious in ap|pealing to the practice of their ance&s;tors, or re|garding the maxims of uncultivated ages as certain rules for her pre&s;ent conduct. An acquaintance with the ancient periods of their goverment is chiefly u&s;eful by in&s;tructing them to cheri&s;h their pre&s;ent con&s;titution, from a compari&s;on or con|tra&s;t with the condition of the&s;e pre&s;ent times.
<PB N="11" REF="030952_0010_0FE9FD9662D04310">
And it is al&s;o curious, by &s;hewing them the re|mote, and commonly faint and disfigured origi|nals, of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed and mo&s;t noble in&s;ti|tutions: and by in&s;tructing them in the great mixture of accident, which commonly concurs with a &s;mall ingredient of wi&s;dom and fore&s;ight, in erecting the complicated fabric of the mo&s;t per|fect government."</P>
<P N="33">33. When the Duke of Clarence mentioned, in the Hou&s;e of Lords in the cour&s;e of the debate on the Slave Trade, that the condition of the &s;laves in the We&s;t Indies was preferable to that of the poor people in Great Britain; it was ob&s;erved, that it would be a humane action in his Highne&s;s, to bring a bill into parliament, to make the con|dition of the poor in this country as good as that of the African &s;laves.</P>
<P N="34">34. A man mu&s;t &s;erve a &s;even years appren|tice&s;hip to be a <HI>&s;hoe-maker;</HI> but all our peers, and a great proportion of our commoners, are born <HI>legi&s;lators.</HI> Nor is this all; if the &s;hoe-maker, after all his &s;tudy does not make &s;hoes to plea&s;e his cu&s;tomers, they will not employ him; but we are obliged to receive all the <HI>manufactures</HI> of the other profe&s;&s;ion above mentioned, be they good or bad.</P>
<P N="35">35. Tho&s;e who hold up to admiration the con|&s;titution of this country, on account of the trial by <HI>jury,</HI> &s;urely do not mean a <HI>&s;pecial jury.</HI></P>
<P N="36">36. <HI>Compari&s;ons of drunkenne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;A man is &s;aid to be <HI>as drunk as an owl,</HI> when he cannot &s;ee&mdash;<HI>as drunk as a &s;ow,</HI> when he wallows in the dirt&mdash;<HI>as drunk as a beggar,</HI> when he is very impudent&mdash;<HI>as drunk as the devil,</HI> when he is inclined to mi&s;chief &mdash;and <HI>as drunk as a lord,</HI> when <HI>he is every thing that is bad.</HI></P>
<P N="37">37. A &s;ucce&s;sful re&s;i&s;tance (&s;ays Mr. Wilkes) is a revolution, not a rebellion. Rebellion indeed, appears on the back of a flying enemy; but Revo|lution
<PB N="12" REF="030952_0011_0FE9FD9A315E6998">
flames or the brea&s;t plate of the victorious warrior.</P>
<P N="38">38. The following equally wi&s;e and loyal re&s;o|lutions, were publi&s;hed in the new&s;papers: &mdash;

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>"Petty France, new York-Street, We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"At a meeting of the inhabitants of the above place, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed to change the name of the &s;treet from <HI>Petty-France,</HI> to <HI>York-&s;treet,</HI> to perpetuate to po&s;terity the dete&s;tation, we, the &s;aid inhabitants, have to <HI>French</HI> princi|ples, politics, and all things that bear an affinity with the di&s;ordered &s;y&s;tem, at pre&s;ent prevailing with that deluded people.</P>
<P>"And we, the &s;aid inhabitants, do agree to call it <HI>York-&s;treet</HI> to commemorate the gallantry of <HI>his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of York,</HI> who &s;o nobly &s;teps forward to defeat the ho&s;tile de&s;igns of a people, who&s;e dangerous and de&s;tructive in|novations, have reduced millions to beggary, and threatened the liberties of this happy country.</P>
<P>"Therefore the public in general, and our friends and connexions in particular, are re|que&s;ted to ob&s;erve, that the &s;aid &s;treet, lately called <HI>Petty-France,</HI> is, by the inhabitants at large, chang'd to <HI>York-&s;treet</HI>; and it is earne&s;tly de&s;ired of every per&s;on, having occa&s;ion to &s;end or write to their friends re&s;iding there (as likewi&s;e the po&s;tmen) will recollect the alteration, and direct, or deliver accordingly.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P N="39">39. A per&s;on pre&s;ent at the above meeting, ob|&s;erved, that it would be better to call it <HI>Fetter|lane.</HI></P>
<P N="40">40. A gentleman being told, that Mr. Dundas
<PB N="13" REF="030952_0012_0FE9FD9BEB7CA508">
had received the freedom of a certain Scotch burgh in a little gold box&mdash;ob&s;erved, that their freedom might be contained in a very little box indeed.</P>
<P N="41">41. Commi&s;&s;ary Wat&s;on fidgets about &s;o at the me&s;s-rooms, and makes &s;uch a thumping noi&s;e with his wooden-leg, that the young officers have given him the nick-name of <HI>dot and go on.</HI></P>
<P N="42">42. The following curious article appeared in a Trea&s;ury new&s;paper, in the month of May la&s;t. &mdash;"In the late engagement, En&s;ign Hamilton, of the 3d regiment, had a very narrow e&s;cape&mdash;a cannon ball was making directly for his head, but a &s;erjeant, who was near him, &s;eeing it, held up his hand, and altered the direction &s;o much, that it only went through Mr. Hamilton's hat!!!</P>
<P N="43">43. During the <HI>Coalition Mini&s;try,</HI> when the late Lord North held the office of one of the prin|cipal Secretaries of State, as he was one day going to his office, in a&s;cending the long &s;tair that leads to it, he was obliged, being a heavy man, to re&s;t him&s;elf at the fir&s;t floor, oppo&s;ite the door leading into the trea&s;ury; at la&s;t he proceeded, ob&s;erving very feelingly, "<HI>Well, I &s;ee that a man may go farther and fare wor&s;e.</HI>"</P>
<P N="44">44. <HI>Seneca</HI> was a Heathen: Hear his ob&s;erva|tion on war&mdash;"<HI>Homo &s;acre res homo, jam per lu|&s;um et jocum occiditur.</HI>"&mdash;"Man, that &s;acred creature man, is &s;ent to death as a matter of plea|&s;ure and diver&s;ion."</P>
<P N="45">45. Notwith&s;tanding the many &s;evere examples made in our courts of ju&s;tice, of per&s;ons, for &s;peaking &s;editiou&s;ly, a man had the audacity to a&s;|&s;ert, in a public coffee room, that <HI>two and two made four.</HI></P>
<P N="46">46. A <HI>Friend to the Con&s;titution</HI> was preaching up the advantages of ari&s;tocracy, and &s;tating the ju&s;tice, that a general or an admiral for his <HI>merits</HI> in conquering the enemies of his <HI>King,</HI>

<P N="47">47. In the time of Mr. Wilkes's patrioti&s;m, he ob&s;erved, in a &s;peech to parliament, that, "The Hou&s;e of Commons meet like a con&s;ul|tation of phy&s;icians where every one's bu&s;ine&s;s is to apply to his own advantage, and not to con|&s;ider the condition of his mi&s;erable patient."</P>
<P N="48">48. On Mr. Pitt being condemned for taking his relations into the cabinet to prevent a <HI>divi&s;ion,</HI> a wag ob&s;erved, that an improvement on this &s;cheme would be, to take all the offices into his own hands, as there would be &s;till le&s;s apprehen|&s;ion of his <HI>dividing again&s;t him&s;elf.</HI></P>

At the quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions held at Cambridge, July 18, 1793, John Cook, a baker, was tried for uttering the following &s;editious words: "I will always have a calf's head for dinner, on the anniver&s;ary of the <HI>martyrdom,</HI> &s;o long as I have money to buy one; King George's head would look well &s;erved up in a di&s;h, there would be cut and come again; and what a wonderful di&s;covery there would be when you came to the brains! Damn the monarchy, I want none; I wi&s;h to &s;ee all the churches down, and the roads mended with them, and the King's chapel made a &s;table of." He was found guilty; and &s;entenced to be im|pri&s;oned three months, to pay a fine of 40<HI>s.</HI> and to find &s;ureties for &s;ix years, him&s;elf in 100<HI>l.</HI> and two &s;ureties in 50<HI>l.</HI> each</P>
<P N="50">50. If the Scotch Judges, in&s;tead of fourteen years tran&s;portation, had adjudged Mr. Muir to be hanged, &s;uch a &s;entence would not have been without precedents in their court: &mdash;</P>
<P>In the year 1600, <HI>Archibald Cornwall</HI> was in|dicted
<PB N="15" REF="030952_0014_0FE9FDA614E75950">
for ignominiou&s;ly di&s;honouring and defa|ming his Maje&s;ty, in making a portrait of him, and laying it upon the po&s;ts of the gibbet, pre&s;&s;ing to fix the &s;ame thereupon."</P>
<P>The Jury "convict Archibald Cornwall of the <HI>trea&s;onable</HI> &s;etting of his Maje&s;ty's portrait to the po&s;ts of the gibbet, and putting of the &s;ame to be hung forth on a nail infixed on the &s;ame gibbet."</P>
<P>The Court decreed him "to forfeit life, lands and goods; and to be taken to the &s;aid gibbet, whereupon he pre&s;&s;ed to hang his Maje&s;ty's por|trait, and there to be hanged until he be dead, and to hang thereupon for the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, with a paper on his forehead, con|taining the vile crime committed by him."</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year <HI>Francis Tenant</HI> was indicted for writing and de&s;per&s;ing &s;landerous letters, re|proachful to the king, his progenitors and coun|cil, and the Jury having found him guilty,</P>
<P>A <HI>royal warrant</HI> was produced by the Lord Ad|vocate, commanding the Court to pronounce the following &s;entence: &mdash;"That the pri&s;oner be ta|ken to the cro&s;s of Edinburgh, and his tongue cut out at the root; that a paper be fixed on his brow, denoting him to be the author of <HI>wild and &s;editious pa&s;quinades;</HI> and that he be then taken to a gal|lows, and hanged till he be dead."</P>
<P>But as the king (James I.) affected clemency, a <HI>&s;econd royal warrant</HI> was produced, in which his Maje&s;ty was <HI>graciou&s;ly</HI> plea&s;ed to declare, that he was content that the pri&s;oner <HI>would only be hanged;</HI> which &s;entence was accordingly pro|nounced and executed.</P>
<P>In 1615 <HI>John Fleming</HI> was hanged for uttering the following words: &mdash;"<HI>Fiend nor the King die or the morn</HI> (no matter if the King die by to mor|row) <HI>that he die of the falling &s;ickne&s;s.</HI>"</P>
<P>In 1618 <HI>Thomas Ro&s;s</HI> or <HI>Rois</HI> was condemned
<PB N="16" REF="030952_0015_0FE9FDA7D6212170">
to have fir&s;t his head &s;truck off, and then his hand and head affixed to different gates in Edinburgh, for having, at Oxford, publi&s;hed a devili&s;h, &s;can|dalous, and &s;editious writing, containing reflex|ions <HI>on his own countrymen;</HI> a&s;&s;erting that they &s;hould all be put from court, excepting his Ma|je&s;ty (James I.) and his children and a few others, and upbraiding the Engli&s;h for &s;uffering them&s;elves to be abu&s;ed by &s;uch a multitude of the off-&s;cour|ing of the people."</P>
<P N="51">51. The following fable, a gro&s;s <HI>libel</HI> upon that <HI>be&s;t</HI> of all po&s;&s;ible goverments, called <HI>Monarchy,</HI> is taken from the ninth chapter of the Book of Judges: &mdash;</P>
<P>"The trees met together to choo&s;e a king; but all the trees of worth declined the office. The olive would not quit the care of its oil, the fig|tree of its figs, the vine of its wine, nor the other trees of their fruit. Thus di&s;appointed, they ap|plied to the <HI>bramble,</HI> as being good for nothing. and becau&s;e it bore thorns and could do mi&s;chief, The bramble, far from declining the honour of reigning over the re&s;t of the trees, &s;howed it&s;elf of the true blood royal, 'every inch a king,' by the following <HI>mo&s;t gracions &s;peech:</HI>&mdash;
<Q>If, in truth, (&s;aid <HI>its</HI> maje&s;ty), you anoint me king, then come and put your tru&s;t in my &s;hadow; if not, the fire &s;hall come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.</Q>"</P>
<P N="52">52. The following might al&s;o be con&s;idered as a libel, at this particular juncture, if it were not extracted from the <HI>Holy Bible:</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>1 <HI>Samuel, chap.</HI> 8.&mdash;"And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that a&s;ked of him a king.</P>
<P>"And he &s;aid, this will be the manner of the king that &s;hall reign over you: he &s;hall take your &s;ons, and appoint them for him&s;elf, for his chariot,
<PB N="17" REF="030952_0016_0FE9FDACA5E28450">
and to be his hor&s;emen; and &s;ome &s;hall run before his chariots.</P>
<P>"And he will appoint him captains over thou|&s;ands, and captains over fifties; and will &s;et them to ear his ground, and to reap his harve&s;t, and to make his in&s;truments of war and in&s;truments of his chariots.</P>
<P>"And he will take your daughters to be con|fectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.</P>
<P>"And he will take your fields, and your vine|yards, and your olive yards, <HI>even the be&s;t of them,</HI> and give them to his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>"And he will take the tenth of your &s;eed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers and &s;er|vants.</P>
<P>"And he will take your men-&s;ervants, and your maid-&s;ervants, and your goodlie&s;t young men, and your a&s;&s;es, and put them to his work.</P>
<P>"And he will take the tenth of your &s;heep; and ye &s;hall be his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>"And ye &s;hall cry out in that day, becau&s;e of your king, which ye &s;hall have cho&s;en you; and the Lord will not hear you that day.</P>
<P N="53">53. Soon after the in&s;titution of the Royal So|ciety, King Charles II. &s;ent as a que&s;tion to them for their di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, "What was the rea&s;on why a dead fi&s;h was &s;o much heavier than a living one?" Many wi&s;e treati&s;es were accordingly written, by the members of this learned body, to point out the phy&s;ical rea&s;ons for this difference. At la&s;t, after the point had undergone a complete di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, it occurred to them to try the fact, when they di&s;|covered, to their no &s;mall mortification, that they were laughed at by the witty King, the living fi&s;h and the dead one being exactly the &s;ame weight.</P>
<P N="54">54. Tho&s;e who find fault with our con&s;titution, certainly do not believe the two following max|ims:
<PB N="18" REF="030952_0017_0FE9FDB0B43F59D8">
I. "That the king <HI>can do</HI> no wrong, and II. That the act of law <HI>never doth</HI> wrong."</P>
<P N="55">55. A gentleman haranguing on the perfection of our law, and that it was equally open to the poor and the rich, was an&s;wered by another, "So is the London Tavern."</P>
<P N="56">56. Dean Swift ob&s;erves, "that con&s;idering how many <HI>hopeful princes</HI> we have had, it is per|fectly a&s;toni&s;hing, that we &s;hould have had &s;o few <HI>tolerable kings.</HI>"</P>
<P N="57">57. A man was lately tried at Aberdeen for ob|&s;tructing a revenue officer; it unfortunately came out on the trial, that the pri&s;oner had been <HI>guilty</HI> of planting <HI>the Tree of Liberty,</HI> where no tree had ever grown before, and where Liberty was not in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tate. The con&s;equence was, a judgment, that he &s;hould be publicly whipped, and bani&s;hed the kingdom for fourteen years.</P>
<P N="58">58. A royal &s;hoe-maker in Bri&s;tol lately adver|ti&s;ed, that he had the honour to be an <HI>alarmi&s;t,</HI> and reque&s;ted the cu&s;tom of all his Maje&s;ty's <HI>loyal Subjects;</HI> as he was re&s;olved not to make &s;hoes for a <HI>republican.</HI></P>
<P N="59">59. A gentleman once ob&s;erved, that if he was obliged to accept a title, it would be that of <HI>knighthood,</HI> as the infamy of it would not de&s;cend on his family.</P>
<P N="60">60. A country gentleman, on hearing that &s;e|veral per&s;ons were puni&s;hed for &s;elling the <HI>Rights of Man,</HI> prote&s;&s;ed, that he thought no puni&s;hment too great for tho&s;e, who dared to SELL <HI>the Rights of Man.</HI></P>
<P N="61">61. There is no <HI>bayonet</HI> &s;o long as to reach <HI>opi|nion.</HI></P>
<P N="62">62. A modern writer &s;ay, "I &s;hall never be|lieve that men were born for &s;lavery, until I &s;ee <HI>kings</HI> produced with <HI>combs</HI> on their heads, like <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;trut and crow; and <HI>men</HI> with <HI>bunches</HI>

<P N="63">63. A countryman was lately &s;een loitering all the forenoon about Somer&s;et Place; a gentle|man a&s;ked him his bu&s;ine&s;s; he &s;aid he had come up from York&s;hire on purpo&s;e to &s;ee Mr. Dun|das; that he him&s;elf, with great labour, gained &pound;. 50 a year, and he was de&s;irous to &s;ee a man, who, from his merits and labour, got from the nation above &pound;. 30,000 a year. The gentleman told him, that Mr. Dundas had, for a week pa&s;t, been amu&s;ing him&s;elf at his country &s;eat at Wim|bleton; but, &s;ays he, if you wi&s;h to &s;ee a man who gets a great deal more, and does &s;till le&s;s than Mr. Dundas, go to St. James's, and you will &s;ee the King. The York&s;hireman an&s;wered, "The King is more than a man: he is God's vicegerent it is our duty to give him a million a-year, and it is his Maje&s;ty's duty to receive it."</P>
<P N="64">64. Mr. Forbes, in the Iri&s;h Hou&s;e of Com|mons, ob&s;erved, in &s;peaking of the ab&s;entees, that he &s;hould have little objection to them as <HI>birds of pa&s;&s;age,</HI> if they did not prove to be <HI>birds of prey.</HI></P>
<P N="65">65. It was ob&s;erved by Mr. Courtney, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, that "the Devil was fir&s;t Ma&s;ter General of the Ordnance."</P>
<P N="66">66. We are apt to &s;peak of the happine&s;s of liv|ing under a mild government, as if it were like the happine&s;s of living under an indulgent climate: and when we thank God for it, we rank it with the ble&s;&s;ings of the air and of the &s;oil; whereas, we ought to thank God for the wi&s;dom and virtue of living under a good government: for a good government is the fir&s;t of national duties.</P>

<P N="7">VII. It is the &s;ame crime to murder the king, or to plunge the country in a civil war, as to coin a &s;ix-pence. To plunge the country in an unne|ce&s;&s;ary foreign war is no crime whatever.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. It is equally capital to &s;et fire to a hay|rick, and to burn a populous town.</P>
