<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>AT a period like the present, we should discover a degree of ungrateful stupidity, not to notice an event, so important as the birth day of our national existence. Standing as I do, young and untaught in the Jurisprudence of nations, it will not be expected that I should entertain you with an elabo|rate political harrangue, or that I should trace, with precision and accuracy, the causes of the rise and downfall of <HI>States</HI> and <HI>Empires.</HI> It shall be my en|deavour, however, to point you to those events that are taking place in the political and moral world, in which, as a nation, we are immediately or more remotely interested.</P>
<P>THE history of the discovery and first settlement of this country is, I presume, familiar to most of you. You need not be told that the heavy hand of oppres|sion drove our virtuous ancestors from the land that gave them birth, that the noble spirit of enterprise
<PB N="4" REF="035966_0004_1007F6C76945D778">
and the glorious love of <HI>Liberty,</HI> stimulated them to build towns and cities in the Wilderness of America. Our revolutionary war, and the causes that operated to set it in motion, are still fresh in the minds of many now present, who have witnessed the manly, arduous, and bloody conflict. The beneficial and glorious effects of that happy event, are now felt and acknowl|edged by every grade in society, from the extremity of Newhampshire, to the remotest boundary of Georgia.</P>
<P>THAT event was succeeded by another, equally important to our respectability as a nation, and our existence as a government, the adoption of the <HI>Fede|ral Constitution,</HI> a system most happily calculated to the genius of our country, secured equally against the encroachments of Despotism on the one hand, and Anarchy on the other; a system which has received the plaudits and admiration of the political sages throughout the world. Under the mild, wise, and virtuous administration of this government, we have experienced perhaps, a greater share of peace and prosperity, than was ever the lot of any other people. Our citizens, enured to habits of industry and econo|my, neither vicious, nor extravagant, have acquired to themselves ease and affluence; unaccustomed to the pomp and parade of European greatness, they have enjoyed the <HI>blessings of their liberty,</HI> and the <HI>sweets of their labour.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="035966_0005_1007F6CA6A0562A0">
But are there not causes in operation, which are ultimately intended to bring about a new order of things, and wrest from us these invaluable privileges? Is there not an extensive combination of <HI>artful, design|ing,</HI> and <HI>unprincipled characters,</HI> even in our own coun|try, who, with their <HI>associates</HI> in different parts of Europe, are conspiring and devising every possible mean, to overthrow the Federal Government, and introduce the same system of terror and confusion, of profligacy and vice, which for more than five years past has ravaged and depopulated no inconsid|erable part of the European World.</P>
<P>FRANCE, noted for her ambition, perfidy, insidu|ousness and intrigue, has, ever since the close of our revolution, manifested a design upon our Independ|ence, with an evident intention to annex us to her own dominions; this, notwithstanding her "Diplo|matic Skill," has been discovered in a great variety of instances. Her first effort was made at concluding the Treaty of <HI>Peace,</HI> and about the same time her influence was first discovered to be operating upon, and biassing certain of our public characters; and to the dishonor of America, one of our own citizens, a man, who then stood high in the confidence of the people, was so far duped as to consent to the terms of a treaty, which, if ratified as was proposed, would have obliged us to look to <HI>France,</HI> as the guarantees of our independence, and the <HI>protectors</HI> of our politi|cal

privileges; which would have embarrassed our commerce, abridged the limits of our territory, and eventually subjugated us to that country. But the penetration and integrity of <HI>Jay</HI> and <HI>Adams</HI> were found sufficient to baffle the policy of the French Court, and the duplicity of the unprincipled <HI>Franklin.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>These facts are stated very minutely in the letter of the Secretary of State, which accompanied the President's message to both Houses of Congress, on the 19th of January, 1797, and which was published throughout the United States. They are also particularly detailed in letters from our Commissioners in Paris, in the years 1782 and 1783, and from members of Congress at the time when the points with France, and the general treaty of peace were in discussion, and from the original correspondence of French Agents, and other authentic documents. These last mentioned papers are principally copied at large by the Rev. Dr. MORSE, in the Appendix to his Thanksgiving Sermon, in November, 1798.</P>
<P>From these papers it is very clear, that Dr. FRANKLIN was strongly implicated in French affairs, that he was generally in opinion with the French minister, count de Vergenes, and con|trary to the determination of Mr. JAY, wished to begin the ne|gociation with Mr. OSWALD, the British minister, under his first commission, which did not recognize our Independence, but con|sidered us in the degrading situation of Colonies, that he (Dr. FRANKLIN) frequently urged the instructions, to be governed by the advice of the court of France in the negociation, alledging that it was their duty to be guided by such advice; the opinion and the advice of that court as declared by VERGENES, was, "That our Commissioners should treat with Mr. OSWALD under the first commission, alledging that it was such as we might have expected, that it was sufficient, and that our Independence might be secured by treaty."&mdash;The court of France were opposed to us as to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, the boundaries, the Mississippi, and the Refugees, and used every means in their power, to deprive us of the three former, and saddle us with the latter; and gave it frequently as their opinion, (through their minister) that the claims of the British, for compensation to the Tories were just and politic, and that we ought to accede to them. It finally appears that "Dr. FRANKLIN was so much in the French interest, at that time, that he was not consulted on those points which it was necessary to conceal from the count de Vergenes." The reader who still has doubts of French intrigue, and the extent of French influence, is requested to turn to the aforementioned documents, and read for himself.</P></NOTE></P>

Here we discover the nature and design of their con|nection and alliance with us: Here, also, is shewn the extent of their claim upon us for gratitude, that "National Gratitude," which the Partizans of France in this country have so repeatedly and exultingly mentioned, to justify their conduct in advocating the cause of the enemies to Government and Religion, to Order and Morality throughout the Universe. 'Tis true that they assisted us; the immediate bene|fit of their aid has never been denied; we contracted for <HI>their</HI> assistance, and we have given them the com|pensation stipulated; they have no pecuniary demands, and why are they intitled to our gratitude? 'Tis clearly established that their motives were not only to harrass and weaken their powerful, inveterate, and mortal enemies, the British; but to unite, insepara|bly, our interest with theirs, to strengthen and aggran|dize themselves; and they are not the less to be de|tested by us, although by our vigilance, under the smiles of the ARRYTER of EVENTS, we have as yet escaped the vortex, and thwarted their policy. Their friendship to us, has been the <HI>friendship of Joab,</HI> and their <HI>embraces the kiss of Judas.</HI></P>

FROM that time to the present they have studiously pursued the same measures; their diplomatic charac|ters amongst us, have been agents, clothed with in|structions, proper to accomplish this great object. The history of their different proceedings is a com|plication of the most unparalleled insolence, and the most barefaced intrigue, in support of which their official communications furnish the most undeniable testimony. They have even dared to engage in rebellion and insurrection against the laws of our country, and to treat with the most pointed indignity, the virtuous administrators of our Government; they have not hesitated to "appeal to the people" in language calculated to catch the popular ear, inflame the passions, and stir up groundless jealousies and dis|contents; they have had recourse to misrepresentation and falsehood, to bribery and corruption; and they have but too well succeeded in creating divisions and animosities amongst us, in revolutionizing and de|moralizing a party in our country which have at times made an alarming appearance.</P>
<P>When our government began to rouse, to speak in the manly tone of Independence, these ministers were recalled; and with apparent indignity, and over|bearing haughtiness, they announced the cessation of their public functions, and departed, leaving behind them the bitterest imprecations, and threatening us with the vengeance of the "Terrible Republic."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="035966_0009_1007F6D357C47CE8">
IMMEDIATELY subsequent to this, their astonishing successes in blood and carnage, in assassination and robberies, gave a new edge to their audacity, and pushed them on more furiously than ever in their mad career of plunder. Our overtures for negocia|tion were spurned at, the Olive Branch was rejected, and our Envoys, men of the highest respectability, and most unimpeachable integrity, were <HI>trifled with, insulted,</HI> and even denied an audience with the <HI>impe|rious Directory;</HI> and without offering to indemnify us for the most unjustifiable depredations, they demand|ed a loan, a heavy tribute, as the preliminary requisite to an examination of the existing controversy, boast|ing of our division, their party in this country, and menacing us with the deplorable condition of Venice and Switzerland.</P>
<P>OUR government in this situation, has conducted with that magnanimity, and adopted those measures which will do them <HI>infinite honor,</HI> so long as the rights of nations, and rational liberty shall be respected in the world. To oppose a barrier to the career of a nation, who had virtually waged war with all civil and religious establishments, who had murdered their king, massacred their most virtuous citizens, and de|stroyed their government; who had overturned their altars, slain their priests, burned the oracles of sacred truth, and amidst the acclamations of deluded thou|sands denied the existence of a God; who had, with
<PB N="10" REF="035966_0010_1007F6D85C7C1570">
a rapidity unequalled in the history of nations, spread devastation and misery wherever they had turned their victorious arms, marking their way with the most unheard of barbarity, and the most cruel and wanton abuse: I say, to oppose a sufficient barrier to this wide spreading torrent of desolation, was the her|culian task of the American Counsels. No sooner were the preparatory measures of defence brought forward, than this <HI>same party,</HI> these emissaries of Talleyrand, made their appearance, rallied round the <HI>standard of faction,</HI> and more vigilant than a centinel upon his post, most vehemently opposed every step which declared our indignation at the treatment of France, which was designed to protect our com|merce from the avaricious grasp of these <HI>rapacious monsters,</HI> and defend our country from the threatened invasion. But these pitiful minions of the <HI>"Five headed Monster,"</HI> these incendiary tools of the "apos|tate Bishop," although taught in the school of Jef|ferson, although aided by the cunning, intrigue, and sophistry of Gallatin, and supported by the delusive eloquence of Nicholas and Livingston, were not able to dupe the steady friends of our government, and frustrate the policy of the ILLUSTRIOUS ADAMS; a man, whose name needs not the aid of panegyric, whose merit, abilities, integrity, and firmness language cannot exalt. Notwithstanding this opposition, war|like measures were adopted, and a naval system was
<PB N="11" REF="035966_0011_1007F6DAF32473F8">
established, which already makes a formidable appear|ance: More than three hundred armed ships are now floating to protect us from the <HI>Pirates</HI> of the Sea; by their exertions a new spring is given to commerce, and business is invigorated; already does the Ameri|can flag vie with the mistress of the Ocean; and the GALLANT TRUXTON, whose heroic and spirited conduct has stamped his name with valor, and en|twined his brow with laurels, has entered the list with the <HI>Pride of Europe,</HI> the IMMORTAL NELSON.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON, too, the tried VETERAN, who stands unrivalled on the list of same, who never stretch|ed forth his arm without doing a valiant deed, who never lifted his sword but to protect and defend the injured rights of human nature, whose presence is a <HI>shield,</HI> and whose name is a <HI>helmet,</HI> He has thrown off the habiliments of domestic life, laid aside the implements of agriculture, clad himself with the <HI>apparatus of war,</HI> and left the tranquil walks of <HI>Mount Vernon,</HI>&mdash;and for what? Not to gain to himself new honors, not to enrich his coffers; but to render a service to that country which he loves as his own, and for which he has spent the flower of his strength, and the vigor of his abilities. Our system of defence, and the dissolu|tion of our treaties with France, has added new lustre to the American character, in the view of all Europe, and given us an elevated situation in the scale of
<PB N="12" REF="035966_0012_1007F6DCC452EB18">
nations; has evinced to the world that we are not a weak and pusillanimous people; but that we are de|termined to maintain our Independence, and support the Government of our own choice, without being guided by the dictates, awed by the threats, or influ|enced by the interference of any foreign power. We ought to know, and to feel that we are Americans, and as such we ought to be united; united, not only to repel an <HI>invading foe</HI> from abroad, but to extirpate the designing and traiterous enemy from our coun|sels, from the bosom of our country; united, not only to support the administration of that government, which protects our lives, secures our property, and guarantees to us our rights; but to encourage that <HI>religion</HI> and <HI>morality,</HI> which gives a zest to all our en|joyments, sweetens life, ameliorates affliction, and brightens futurity.</P>
<P>IT has been the vain boast of America, that she was an assylum for the oppressed from all parts of the world; this has invited not only those who were disaffected with their own government, <HI>traiterous rebels,</HI> the enthusiastic advocates for civil and religious innovations; but fugitives from justice, and abandon|ed villains, to fly to our shores. We have re|ceived them, with extended arms, given them our confidence, and elevated them to the seats of legislation: And it is a fact, that almost every foreigner
<PB N="13" REF="035966_0013_1007F6DF7249E6C0">
thus noticed, has been uniformly and violently oppos|ed to the administration, embarrassed our national concerns, disgraced our councils, and dishonored our country. To <HI>these,</HI> and their mercenary adherents, may we look for the great source of our disunion, and political dissentions; they have been incessantly sowing the seeds of discord, haranguing the mob, talking of liberty and equality, the rights of man, and the reign of reason, which, reduced to practice upon <HI>their</HI> scheme, is <HI>anarchy</HI> and <HI>licentiousness, immorality</HI> and <HI>deism.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are characters, which, if encouraged, which, if suffered to proceed, will prove more deadly enemies, more hostile to the peace and existence of our Gov|ernment, than the spears and bayonets of all the world besides. Their conduct has a direct tendency to sap the foundation of a Republican Government, and mar the very pillars of Liberty: They aim a deadly blow at virtue and religion, and laugh at the idea of moral obligation, without the support and restraints of which, they know that our government is an easy prey. To destroy this great tie of civil society, is the grand object of that new species of philosophy, which is making such astonishing strides through the world, defacing and destroying the beauties of antiquity; which has made its way into our own country, and is zealously disseminated amongst us by the man who disgraces the second <HI>office</HI> in the <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="035966_0014_1007F6E331A240C8">
THESE are the principles which gave rise to the French revolution, and all the horrid scenes of mur|der and debauchery which have been exhibited in that "devoted country:" These are the principles which actuated the tyrants of that nation, to send forth their armed banditti, commissioned to destroy the peace and existence of all the flourishing Republics in Eu|rope; which have laid desolate the most beautiful towns in Germany; Villages, where the rude insults of the lawless debauchee, the hand of the rober, and the midnight assassin, were never known before; <HI>these</HI> are the principles which have hurried them, with more savage ferocity, into every place where the blessings of liberty, and the practice of virtue, had made the people happy and respectable; and <HI>these</HI> are the principles, the progress of which, we devoutly hope, that God in his infinite mercy is about to arrest. From the ever memorable naval victory at the mouth of the Nile, we may date the commencement of the retrograde career of this revolutionary phrenzy, this "Indivisible Republic." The order of things is now changing, French laurels are withering, and those steps which they formerly made with inpious triumph and wanton sacrilege, they are now measuring back, with slaughter and confussion, with bloodshed and despair.</P>
<P>With us, too, the spirit of party is subsiding, the scales are falling from our eyes, the clouds are dissi|pating,
<PB N="15" REF="035966_0015_1007F6E4C25C2040">
and the prospect brightens. The great body of the people are united to oppose the influence of this vain philosophy, and the fatal effects of these per|nicious principles: United, may I not say, to support the dignity of our national character, by purging our government, in all its departments, of these <HI>foreign miscreants,</HI> and <HI>their abetters;</HI> and united also, to repair to the <HI>Standard of our Country,</HI> and, under the <HI>Eagle of America,</HI> pledge our lives to defend it. If I do not mistake in this, we may indulge the idea, the hope, the assurance, that, under the guardian pro|tection of HIM who has been the GOD of our armies and our counsels, we shall still be a FREE, FLOURISH|ING, HAPPY, and INDEPENDENT NATION.</P>
