<P>IN recounting the numerous ble&s;&s;ings which have ari&s;en to mankind from the di&s;covery of America, the mind dwells with particular plea&s;ure and grati|tude upon tho&s;e Characters, from who&s;e hands the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings have immediately flowed. That change in the political face of Europe, that liberality of &s;entiment, that enlargement of commercial, milita|ry and philo&s;ophical knowledge, which contra&s;t the pre&s;ent with the fifteenth century, are but &s;o many con&s;equences of this great event; an event whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> laid open all parts of the earth to the range of the

liberal mind. The illu&s;trious line of your royal Ance&s;tors have been con&s;picuous in &s;eizing tho&s;e advantages and diffu&s;ing their happy effects. The great Father of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon will be held in the highe&s;t veneration, till his favourite political &s;y&s;tem &s;hall be realized among the nations of Eu|rope, and extended to all mankind. But it was left to his more glorious De&s;cendant, to accelerate the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, by di&s;regarding the tempo|rary intere&s;ts and local policies of other Monarchs, reaching the hand of beneficence to another hem|i&s;phere, and rai&s;ing an infant empire, in a few years, to a degree of importance, which &s;everal ages were &s;carcely thought &s;ufficient to produce.</P>
<P>THIS is the &s;ublime of humanity, to feel for fu|ture ages and di&s;tant nations; to act tho&s;e things, as a Monarch, which another can only contemplate as a Philo&s;opher, or image in the flights of poetry. America acknowledges her obligations to the Guar|dian of her rights; mankind, who &s;urvey your con|duct, and po&s;terity, for whom you act, will &s;ee that the tribute of gratitude is paid.</P>
<P>IF to patronize the Arts can add to the prai&s;e of the&s;e more glorious actions, your Maje&s;ty's fame in this re&s;pect will be ever &s;acred; as there are none, who can feel the &s;ubject &s;o &s;trongly as tho&s;e who

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY circum&s;tance relating to the di&s;covery and &s;ettlement of America, is an intere&s;ting object of enquiry. Yet it is pre&s;umed, from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of literature in this country, that many per&s;ons, who might be entertained with an American production of this kind, are but &s;lightly acquainted with the life and character of that great man, who&s;e extraordinary genius led him to the di&s;covery of the continent, and who&s;e &s;ingular &s;ufferings ought to excite the indigna|tion of the world.</P>
<P>THE Spani&s;h hi&s;torians, who treat of the di&s;covery and &s;ettlement of South-America, are very little known in the United States; and Doctor Robert&s;on's hi&s;to|ry of that country, which, as is u&s;ual in the works of that judicious writer, contains all that is valuable on the &s;ubject, is not yet reprinted in America, and therefore cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the hands of American readers in general: and perhaps no other writer in the Engli&s;h language has given a &s;ufficient account of the life of Columbus to enable them to un|der&s;tand many of the nece&s;&s;ary allu&s;ions in the fol|lowing Poem.</P>
<P>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS was born in the repub|lic of Genoa about the year 1447; at a time when the navigation of Europe was &s;carcely extended be|yond the limits of the Mediterranean. The mari|ner's compa&s;s had been invented and in common u&s;e for more than a century; yet with the help of this
<PB N="viii" REF="020220_0006_0FAE44DA6C008E90">
&s;ure guide, prompted by the mo&s;t ardent &s;pirit of di&s;covery, and encouraged by the patronage of prin|ces, the mariners of tho&s;e days rarely ventured from the &s;ight of land. They acquired great applau&s;e by &s;ailing along the coa&s;t of Africa and di&s;covering &s;ome of the neighbouring i&s;lands; and after pu&s;hing their re&s;earches with the greate&s;t indu&s;try and per&s;everance for more than half a century, the Portugue&s;e, who were the mo&s;t fortunate and enterpri&s;ing, extended their di&s;coveries &s;outhward no farther than the equator.</P>
<P>THE rich commodities of the Ea&s;t had for &s;everal ages been brought into Europe by the way of the Red Sea and the Mediterranean; and it had now become the object of the Portugue&s;e to find a pa&s;&s;age to In|dia, by &s;ailing round the &s;outhern extremity of Africa and then taking an ea&s;tern cour&s;e. This great object engaged the general attention of mankind, and drew into the Portugue&s;e &s;ervice adventurers from every maritime nation in Europe. Every year added to their experience in navigation and &s;eemed to promi&s;e a reward to their indu&s;try. The pro&s;pect however of arriving at the Indies was extremely di&s;tant; fifty years per&s;everance in the &s;ame track, had brought them only to the equator, and it was probable that as many more would elap&s;e before they could accompli&s;h their pur|po&s;e. But Columbus, by an uncommon exertion of genius, formed a de&s;ign no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hing to the age in which he lived, than beneficial to po&s;terity. This de&s;ign was to &s;ail to India by taking a we&s;tern direc|tion. By the accounts of travellers who had vi&s;ited India, that country &s;eemed almo&s;t without limits on the ea&s;t; and by attending to the &s;pherical figure of the earth, Columbus drew this conclu&s;ion, that the At|lantic ocean mu&s;t be bounded on the we&s;t either by India it&s;elf, or by &s;ome great continent not far di&s;tant from it.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="020220_0007_0FAE44DB28427520">THIS extraordinary man, who was now about twen|ty-&s;even years of age, appears to have united in his character every trait, and to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every tal|lant, requi&s;ite to form and execute the greate&s;t enter|prizes. He was early educated in all the u&s;eful &s;ci|ences that were taught in that day. He had made great proficiency in geography, a&s;tronomy and draw|ing, as they were nece&s;&s;ary to his favourite pur&s;uit of navigation. He had now been a number of years in the &s;ervice of the Portugue&s;e, and had acquired all the experience that their voyages and di&s;coveries could afford. His courage and per&s;everance had been put to the &s;evere&s;t te&s;t, and the exerci&s;e of every amiable and heroic virtue rendered him univer&s;ally known and re&s;pected. He had married a Portugue&s;e lady by whom he had two &s;ons&punc; Diego and Fardinand; the younger of whom is the hi&s;torian of his life.</P>
<P>SUCH was the &s;ituation of Columbus, when he form|ed and thoroughly dige&s;ted a plan, which, in its op|eration and con&s;equences, unfolded to the view of mankind one half of the globe, diffu&s;ed wealth and dignity over the other, and extended commerce and civilization through the whole&punc; To corroborate the theory which he had formed of the exi&s;tence of a we&s;|tern continent, his de&s;cerning mind, which always knew the application of every circum&s;tance that fell in his way&punc; had ob&s;erved &s;everal facts which by others would have pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed. In his voyages to the African i&s;lands he had found, floating a&s;hore after a long we&s;tern &s;torm, pieces of wood carved in a curi|ous manner, canes of a &s;ize unknown in that quarter of the world, and human bodies with very &s;ingular features. Fully confirmed in the opinion that a con|&s;iderable portion of the earth was &s;till undi&s;covered, his genius was too vigorous and per&s;evering to &s;uffer an idea of this importance to re&s;t merely in &s;pecula|tion,
<PB N="x" REF="020220_0008_0FAE44DCA8770240">
as it had done in the minds of Plato and Seneca, who appear to have had conjectures of a &s;imilar na|ture. He determined therefore to bring his favourite theory to the te&s;t of actual experiment. But an ob|ject of that magnitude required the patronage of a Prince; and a de&s;ign &s;o extraordinary met with all the ob&s;tructions, delays and di&s;appointments, which an age of &s;uper&s;tition could invent, and which per&s;onal jealou&s;y and malice could magnify and encourage. Happily for mankind, in this in&s;tance, a genius, ca|pable of devi&s;ing the greate&s;t undertakings, a&s;&s;ociat|ed in it&s;elf a degree of patience and enterprize, mo|de&s;ty and confidence, which rendered him &s;uperior, not only to the&s;e misfortunes, but to all the future ca|lamities of his life. Prompted by the mo&s;t ardent enthu&s;ia&s;m to be the di&s;coverer of new continents, and fully &s;en&s;ible of the advantages that would re&s;ult to mankind from &s;uch di&s;coveries, he had the mortifica|tion to wa&s;te away eighteen years of his life, after his &s;y&s;tem was well e&s;tabli&s;hed in his own mind, before he could obtain the means of executing his de&s;igns. The greate&s;t part of this period was &s;pent in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive and fruitle&s;s &s;olicitations, at Genoa, Portugal and Spain. As a duty to his native country, he made his fir&s;t propo&s;al to the Senate of Genoa; where it was &s;oon rejected. Con&s;cious of the truth of his theory, and of his own abilities to execute his de&s;ign, he re|tired without dejection from a body of men who were incapable of forming any ju&s;t ideas upon the &s;ubject; and applied with fre&s;h confidence to John the &s;econd, King of Portugal, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as the great patron of navigation, and in who&s;e &s;ervice Columbus had acquired a reputation which entitled him and his project to general confidence and appro|bation. But here he &s;uffered an in&s;ult much greater than a direct refu&s;al. After referring the examina|tion of his &s;cheme to the council who had the direc|tion
<PB N="xi" REF="020220_0009_0FAE44DED562D2B0">
of naval affairs, and drawing from him his gen|eral ideas of the length of the voyage and the cour&s;e he meant to take, that great monarch had the mean|ne&s;s to con&s;pire with this council to rob Columbus of the glory and advantage he expected to derive from his undertaking. While Columbus was amu&s;ed with this negotiation, in hopes of having his &s;cheme adopt|ed and patronized, a ve&s;&s;el was &s;ecretly di&s;patched, by order of the king, to make the intended di&s;covery. Want of &s;kill and per&s;everance in the pilot rendered the plot un&s;ucce&s;sful; and Columbus, on di&s;covering the treachery, retired with an ingenuous indignation from a court capable of &s;uch duplicity.</P>
<P>HAVING now performed what was due to the coun|try that gave him birth and to the one that had a|dopted him as a &s;ubject, he was at liberty to court the patronage of any prince who &s;hould have the wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice to accept his propo&s;als. He had com|municated his ideas to his brother Bartholomew, whom he &s;ent to England to negotiate with Henry &s;eventh; at the &s;ame time that he went him&s;elf into Spain to apply in per&s;on to Fardinand and I&s;abella, who go|verned the united kingdoms of Aragon and Ca&s;tile. The circum&s;tances of his brother's application in Eng|land, which appears to have been un&s;ucce&s;sful, is not to my purpo&s;e to relate; and the limits pre&s;cribed to this introduction will prevent the detail of all the par|ticulars relating to his own negociation in Spain. In this negociation Columbus &s;pent eight years, in the various agitations of &s;u&s;pence, expectation and di&s;ap|pointment; till, at length his &s;cheme was adopted by I&s;abella, who undertook, as Queen of Ca&s;tile, to de|&s;troy the expences of the exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dition; and declared her&s;elf, ever after, the friend and patron of the hero who projected it.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="020220_0010_0FAE44DEE9A0E7F8">COLUMBUS, who, during all his ill &s;ucce&s;s in the ne|gotiation, never abated any thing of the honours and emo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ments which he expected to acquire in the ex|pedition, obtained from Fardinand and I&s;abella a full &s;tipulation of every article contained in his fir&s;t pro|po&s;als. He was con&s;tituted high Admiral and Vice|roy of all the Seas, I&s;lands and Continents which he &s;hould di&s;cover; with power to receive one tenth of the profits ari&s;ing from their productions and com|merce. The&s;e offices and emoluments were to be heredita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y in his family.</P>
<P>THESE articles being adju&s;ted, the preparations for the voyage were brought forward with rapidity; but they were by no means adequate to the importance of the expedition. Three &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, &s;carcely &s;uffici|ent in &s;ize to be employed in the coa&s;ting bu&s;ine&s;s, were appointed to traver&s;e the va&s;t Atlantic; and to encounter the &s;torms and currents that might be ex|pected in &s;o lengthy a voyage, through di&s;tant and un|known &s;eas. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els, as might be expected in the infancy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avigation, were ill con&s;tructed, in a poor condition, and manned by &s;eamen unaccu&s;tomed to di&s;tant voyages. But the tedious length of time which Columbus had &s;pent in &s;olicitation and &s;u&s;|pence, and the pro&s;pect of being able &s;oon, to obtain the object of his wi&s;hes, induced him to overlook what he could not ea&s;ily remedy, and led him to di&s;|regard tho&s;e circum&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ances which would have intimid|ated any other mind. He accordingly equiped his &s;mall &s;quadron with as much expedition as po&s;&s;ible, manned with ninety men and victualled for one year. With the&s;e, on the 3d of Augu&s;t 1492, amid&s;t a va&s;t croud of anxious &s;pectators, he &s;et &s;ail on an enter|prize, which, if we con&s;ider th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ill condition of his &s;hips, the inexperience of his &s;ailors, the length and

uncertainty of his voyage, and the con&s;equences that flowed from it, was the mo&s;t daring and important that ever was undertaken. He touched at &s;ome of the Portugue&s;e &s;ettlements in the Canary I&s;les; where, although he had had but a few days run, he found his ve&s;&s;els needed refitting. He &s;oon made the nece&s;&s;ary repairs, and took his departure from the we&s;termo&s;t I&s;lands that had hitherto been di&s;covered. Here he left the former track of navigation and &s;teered his cour&s;e due we&s;t.</P>
<P>NOT many days after he had been at &s;ea, he began to experience a new &s;cene of difficulty. The &s;ailors now began to contemplate the dangers and uncertain i&s;&s;ue of a voyage, the nature and length of which was left entirely open to conjecture. Be&s;ides the fickle|ne&s;s and timidity natural to men unaccu&s;tomed to the di&s;cipline of a &s;eafaring life, &s;everal circum&s;tances contributed to in&s;pire an ob&s;tinate and mutinous di&s;po|&s;ition, which required the mo&s;t con&s;ummate art as well as fortitude in the admiral to controul. Having been three weeks at &s;ea, and experienced the uniform cour&s;e of the trade winds, which always blow in a we&s;t|ern direction, they contended that, &s;hould they con|tinue the &s;ame cour&s;e for a longer period, the &s;ame winds would never permit them to return to Spain. The magnetic needle began to vary its direction. This being the fir&s;t time that phenomenon was ever di&s;covered, it was viewed by the &s;ailors with a&s;toni&s;h|ment, and con&s;idered as an indication that nature it|&s;elf had changed her cour&s;e, and that Providence was determined to puni&s;h their audacity, in venturing &s;o far beyond the ordinary bounds of man. They declared that the commands of their &s;overeign had been fully obeyed, in their proceeding &s;o many days in the &s;ame direction, and &s;o far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the attempts of all for|mer

navigators, in que&s;t of new di&s;coveries. Every talent, requi&s;ite for governing, &s;oothing and temper|ing the pa&s;&s;ions of men, is con&s;picuous in the conduct of Columbus on this occa&s;ion. The dignity and af|fability of his manners, his &s;urpri&s;ing knowledge and experience in naval affairs, his unwearied and minute attention to the duties of his command gave him a complete a&s;cendant over the minds of his men, and in&s;pired that degree of confidence which would have maintained his authority in almo&s;t any po&s;&s;ible cir|cum&s;tances. But here, from the nature of the under|taking, every man had lei&s;ure to feed his imagination with all the gloomine&s;s and uncertainty of the pro&s;|pect. They found, every day, that the &s;ame &s;teady gales carried them with great rapidity from their na|tive country, and indeed from all countries of which they had any knowledge. Notwith&s;tanding all the variety of management with which Columbus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to their pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ometimes by &s;oothing them with the progno&s;tics of di&s;covering land, &s;ometimes by flattering their ambition and fea&s;ting their avarice with the glory and wealth they would acquire from di&s;covering tho&s;e rich countries beyond the Atlantic, and &s;ometimes by threatening them with the di&s;plea|&s;ure of their &s;overeign, &s;hould their timidity and di&s;|obedience defeat &s;o great an object, their unea&s;ine&s;s &s;till increa&s;ed. From &s;ecret whi&s;perings, it aro&s;e to o|pen mutiny and dangerous con&s;piracy. At length they determined to rid them&s;elves of the remon&s;tran|ces of Columbus, by throwing him into the &s;ea. The infection &s;pread from &s;hip to &s;hip, and involved Offi|cers as well as common &s;ailors. They finally lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of &s;ubordination, and addre&s;&s;ed their command|er in an in&s;olent manner, demanding to be conducted immediately back to Spain; or, they a&s;&s;ured him, they would &s;eek their own &s;afety by taking away his life.
<PB N="xv" REF="020220_0013_0FAE44E5A7756508">
Columbus, who&s;e &s;agacity and penetration had di&s;|covered every &s;ymptom of the di&s;order, was prepared for this la&s;t &s;tage of it, and was &s;ufficiently apprized of the danger that awaited him. He found it vain to con|tend with pa&s;&s;ions he could no longer controul. He therefore propo&s;ed that they &s;hould obey his orders for three days longer; and, &s;hould they not di&s;cover land in that time, he would then direct his cour&s;e for Spain. They complied with his propo&s;al; and, hap|pily for mankind, in three days they di&s;covered Land. This was a &s;mall I&s;land, to which Columbus gave the name of San Salvador. Their fir&s;t interview with the natives was a &s;cene of amu&s;ement and compa&s;&s;ion on the one part, and of a&s;toni&s;hment and adoration on the other. The natives were entirely naked, &s;im|ple and timorous, and they viewed the Spaniards as a &s;uperior order of beings, de&s;cended from the Sun, which, in that I&s;land and in mo&s;t parts of America, was wor&s;hiped as a Deity. By this it was ea&s;y for Colum|bus to perceive the line of conduct proper to be ob|&s;erved toward that &s;imple and inoffen&s;iv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> people. Had his companions and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, of the Spani&s;h na|tion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the wi&s;dom and humanity of that great di&s;coverer, the benevolent mind would feel no &s;en&s;a|tions, of regret, in contemplating the exten&s;ive advan|tages ari&s;ing to mankind from the di&s;covery of A|merica.</P>
<P>IN this voyage, Columbus di&s;covered the I&s;lands of Cuba and Hi&s;paniola; on the latter of which, he erect|ed a &s;mall fort, and having left a garri&s;on of thirty|eight men, under the command of an Officer by the name of Arada, he &s;et &s;ail for Spain. Returning a|cro&s;s the Atlantic, he was overtaken by a violent &s;torm, which la&s;ted &s;everal days and increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, as baffled all his naval &s;kill and threatened
<PB N="xvi" REF="020220_0014_0FAE44E7892F8448">
immediate de&s;truction. In this &s;ituation, when all were in a &s;tate of de&s;pair, and it was expected that ev|ery &s;ea would &s;wallow up the crazy ve&s;&s;el, he manife&s;t|ed a &s;erenity and pre&s;ence of mind, perhaps never e|qualled in ca&s;es of like extremity. He wrote a &s;hort account of his voyage and of the di&s;coveries he had made, wrapped it in an oiled cloth, enclo&s;ed it in a cake of wax, put it into an empty ca&s;k and threw it o|verboard; in hopes that &s;ome accident might pre|&s;erve a depo&s;it of &s;o much importance to the world.</P>
<P>THE &s;torm however abated, and he at length ar|rived in Spain; after having been driven by &s;tre&s;s of weather into the Port of Li&s;bon, where he had oppor|tunity in an interview with the King of Portugal, to prove the truth of his &s;y&s;tem by arguments more con|vincing than tho&s;e he had before advanced, in the character of an humble and un&s;ucce&s;sful &s;uitor. He was received every where in Spain with Royal hon|ours, his family was ennobled, and his former &s;tipula|tion re&s;pecting his offices and emoluments was ratifi|ed in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, by Fardinand and I&s;a|bella; while all Europe re&s;ounded his prai&s;es and re|ciprocated their joy and congratulations on the di&s;cov|ery of a new world.</P>
<P>THE immediate con&s;equence of this was a &s;econd voyage; in which Columbus took charge of a &s;quad|ron of &s;eventeen Ships of con&s;iderable burthen. Vo|lunteers of all ranks and conditions &s;olicited to be employed in this expedition. He carried over fif|teen hundred per&s;ons, together with all the nece&s;&s;a|ries for e&s;tabli&s;hing a Colony and extending his di&s;|coveries. In this voyage he explored mo&s;t of the We&s;t-India I&s;lands; but, on his arrival at Hi&s;paniola, he found the garri&s;on he had left there had been total|ly
<PB N="xvii" REF="020220_0015_0FAE44E8235EDAF8">
de&s;troyed by the natives, and the fort demoli&s;hed. He however proceeded in the planting of his colo|ny; and, by his prudent and humane conduct towards the natives, he effectually e&s;tabli&s;hed the Spani&s;h au|thority in that I&s;land. But while he was thus laying the foundation of their future grandeur in South A|merica, &s;ome di&s;contented per&s;ons, who had returned from the colony to Spain, together with his former enemies in that Kingdom, con&s;pired to accompli&s;h his ruin.</P>
<P>THEY repre&s;ented his conduct in &s;uch a light at court, as to create unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;tru&s;t in the jeal|ous mind of Fardinand, and made it nece&s;&s;ary for Co|lumbus again to return to Spain, in order to counter|act their machinations, and to obtain &s;uch farther &s;up|plies as were nece&s;&s;ary to his great political and be|nevolent purpo&s;es. On his arriving at court, and &s;tating with his u&s;ual dignity and confidence the whole hi&s;tory of his tran&s;actions abroad, every thing wore a favourable appearance. He was received with u&s;ual honours, and again &s;olicited to take charge of another &s;quadron, to carry out farther &s;upplies, to pur&s;ue his di&s;coveries, and in every re&s;pect to u&s;e his di&s;cretion in extending the Spani&s;h Empire in the new World. In this third voyage he di&s;covered the Con|tinent of America at the mouth of the river Oronoque. He rectified many di&s;orders in his government of Hi|&s;paniola which had happened in his ab&s;ence; and ev|ery thing was going on in a pro&s;perous train, when an event was announced to him, which completed his own ruin, and gave a fatal turn to the Spani&s;h policy and conduct in America. This was the arrival of Francis de Bovadilla, with a commi&s;&s;ion to &s;upercede Columbus in his government; and with power to ar|raign him as a criminal, and to judge of his former admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="020220_0016_0FAE44E8B3138BD8">IT &s;eems that by this time the enemies of Columbus, de&s;pairing to complete his overthrow by groundle&s;s in&s;inuations of mal-conduct, had taken the more ef|fectual method of exciting the jealou&s;y of their Sove|reigns. From the promi&s;ing &s;amples of Gold and oth|er valuable commodities brought from America, they took occa&s;ion to repre&s;ent to the King and Queen, that the prodigious wealth and extent of the countries he had di&s;covered would &s;oon throw &s;uch power into the hands of the Viceroy, that he would trample on the Royal Authority and bid defiance to the Spani&s;h pow|er. The&s;e arguments were well calculated for the cold and &s;u&s;picious temper of Fardinand, and they mu&s;t have had &s;ome effect upon the mind of I&s;abella. The con&s;equence was the appointment of Bavadilla, who had been the inveterate enemy of Columbus, to take the government from his hands. This fir&s;t tyrant of the Spani&s;h nation in America began his admini|&s;tration by ordering Columbus to be put in chains on board a &s;hip, and &s;ending him pri&s;oner to Spain. By relaxing all di&s;cipline he introduced di&s;order and licen|ciou&s;ne&s;s throughout the colony. He &s;ubjected the unhappy natives to a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;ervitude, and ap|portioned them out in large numbers among his adhe|rents. Under this &s;evere treatment peri&s;hed in a &s;hort time many thou&s;ands of tho&s;e innocent people.</P>
<P>COLUMBUS was carried in his fetters to the Spani&s;h court, where the King and Queen either feigned or felt a &s;ufficient regret at the conduct of Bovadilla to|wards this illu&s;trious pri&s;oner. He was not only re|lea&s;ed from confinement, but treated with all imagin|able re&s;pect. But, although the king endeavoured to expiate the offence by cen&s;uring and recalling Bova|dilla, yet we may judge of his &s;incerity from his ap|pointing Nicholas de Ovando, another bitter enemy of Columbus, to &s;ucceed in the government, and from
<PB N="xix" REF="020220_0017_0FAE44E97052C9E0">
his ever after refu&s;ing to rein&s;tate Columbus, or to ful|fil any of the conditions on which the di&s;coveries were undertaken. After two years &s;olicitation for this or &s;ome other employment, he at length obtained a &s;quadron of four &s;mall ve&s;&s;els to attempt new di&s;cove|ries. He now &s;et out, with the ardour and enthu&s;ia&s;m of a young adventurer, in que&s;t of what was always his favourite object, a pa&s;&s;age into the South Sea, by which he might &s;ail to India. He touched at Hi&s;pan|iola, where Ovando, the governor, refu&s;ed him admit|tance on &s;hore even to take &s;helter during a hurricane, the progno&s;tics of which his experience had taught him to di&s;cern. By putting into a &s;mall creek, he rode out the &s;torm, and then bore away for the conti|nent. Several months, in the mo&s;t boi&s;terous &s;ea&s;on of the year, he &s;pent in exploring the coa&s;t round the gulph of Mexico, in hopes of finding the intended navigation to India. At length he was &s;hipwrecked, and driven a&s;hore on the I&s;land of Jamaica.</P>
<P>HIS cup of calamities &s;eemed now completely full. He was ca&s;t upon an i&s;land of &s;avages, without pro|vi&s;ions, without any ve&s;&s;el, and thirty leagues from any Spani&s;h &s;ettlement. But the greate&s;t providen|tial misfortunes are capable of being imbittered by the in&s;ults of our fellow creatures. A few of his hardy companions generou&s;ly offered, in two Indian canoes, to attempt a voyage to Hi&s;paniola, in hopes of obtaining a ve&s;&s;el for the relief of the unhappy crew. After &s;uffering every extremity of danger and hard&s;hip, they arrived at the Spani&s;h colony in ten days. Ovando, through per&s;onal malice and jeal|ou&s;y of Columbus, after having detained the&s;e me&s;|&s;engers eight months, di&s;patched a ve&s;&s;el to Jamaica, in order to &s;py out the condition of Columbus and his crew; with po&s;itive in&s;tructions to the Captain not to afford them any relief. This order was punctually executed. The Captain approached the
<PB N="xx" REF="020220_0018_0FAE44EA4A983C08">
&s;hore, delivered a letter of empty compliment from Ovando to the Admiral, received his an&s;wer and re|turned. About four months afterwards a ve&s;&s;el came to their relief; and Columbus, worn out with fatigues and broken with misfortunes, returned for the la&s;t time to Spain. Here a new di&s;tre&s;s awaited him, which he con&s;idered as one of the greate&s;t he had &s;uf|fered, in his whole life. This was the death of Queen I&s;abella, his la&s;t and greate&s;t friend.</P>
<P>HE did not &s;uddenly abandon him&s;elf to de&s;pair. He called upon the gratitude and ju&s;tice of the King; and, in terms of dignity, demanded the fulfilment of his former contract. Notwith&s;tanding his age and infirmities, he even &s;olicited to be farther employed in extending the career of di&s;covery, without a pro&s;|pect of any other reward but the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing good to mankind. But Fardinand, col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ungrateful and timid, dared not to comply with a &s;ingle propo|&s;al of this kind, le&s;t he &s;hould encrea&s;e his own obli|gations to a man, who&s;e &s;ervices he thought it danger|ous to reward. He therefore delayed and avoided any deci&s;ion on the&s;e &s;ubjects, in hopes that the declining health of Columbus would &s;oon rid the court of the remon&s;trances of a man, who&s;e extraordinary merit was, in their opinion, a &s;ufficient occa&s;ion of de&s;troy|ing him. In this they were not di&s;appointed. Co|lumbus langui&s;hed a &s;hort time, and gladly re&s;igned a life, which had been worn out in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices perhaps that were ever rendered, by any hu|man character, to an ungrateful world.</P>
<P>SOMETIME in this gloomy interval, before his death, the Vi&s;ion is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been pre&s;ented to him; in order to &s;atisfy his benevolent mind, by unfolding to him the importance of his di&s;coveries, in their ex|ten&s;ive influence upon the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of mankind, in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="xxi" REF="020220_0019_0FAE44EAFA0E7128">THE Author has indulged a &s;mall anachroni&s;m in the opening of the Poem, for the &s;ake of grouping the misfortunes of the hero; as the time of his actu|al impri&s;onment was previous to his la&s;t voyage and to the death of I&s;abella.</P>
<P>THE Author, at fir&s;t, formed an idea of attempting a regular Epic Poem, on the di&s;covery of America. But on examining the nature of that event, he found that the mo&s;t brilliant &s;ubjects incident to &s;uch a plan would ari&s;e from the con&s;equences of the di&s;covery, and mu&s;t be repre&s;ented in vi&s;ion. Indeed to have made it a patriotic Poem, by extending the &s;ubject to the &s;ettlement and revolutions of North America and their probable effect upon the future progre&s;s of &s;oci|ety at large, would have protracted the vi&s;ion to &s;uch a degree as to render it di&s;proportionate to the re&s;t of the work. To avoid an ab&s;urdity of this kind, which he &s;uppo&s;ed the critics would not pardon, he rejected the idea of a regular Epic form, and has con|fined his plan to the train of events which might be re|pre&s;ented to the hero in vi&s;ion. This form he con|&s;iders as the be&s;t that the nature of the &s;ubject would admit; and the regularity of the parts will appear by ob&s;erving, that there is a &s;ingle poetical de&s;ign con|&s;tantly kept in view, which is to gratify and &s;ooth the de&s;ponding mind of the hero: It being the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible reward of his &s;ervices, and the only one that his &s;it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion would permit him to enjoy, to convince him that his labours had not been be&s;towed in vain, and that he was the author of &s;uch exten&s;ive happine&s;s to the human race.</P>

<L>To ble&s;s the nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>From the traditions of Capac and Oella, mentioned by the Spani&s;h hi&s;torians, they appear to have been very great and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed characters. About three centuries previous to the di&s;cov|ery of that country by the Spaniards, the natives of Peru were as rude &s;avages as any in America. They had no fixed habitations, no ideas of permanent property; they wandered naked like the bea&s;ts, and, like them, depended on the events of each day for a precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. At this period, Manco Capac and his wife Mama Oella appeared on a &s;mall i&s;land in the lake Titiaca; near which the city of Cu&s;co was afterwards erected. The&s;e per&s;ons, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a belief of their divinity, in the minds of the peo|ple, were clothed in white garments of cotton; and declared them|&s;elves de&s;cended from the Sun, who was their father and the God of that country. They affirmed that he was offended at their cruel and perpetual wars, their barbarous modes of wor&s;hip, and their neglecting to make the be&s;t u&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ings he was con&s;tantly be&s;towing, in fertilizing the earth and producing vegetation; that he pitied their wretched &s;tate, and had &s;ent his own children to in|&s;truct them, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a number of wi&s;e regulations, by which they might be rendered happy.</P>
<P>By &s;ome extraordinary method of per&s;ua&s;ion, the&s;e per&s;ons drew together a number of the &s;avage tribes, laid the foundations of the city of Cu&s;co, and e&s;tabli&s;hed what was called the kingdom of the Sun, or the Peruvian empire. In the reign of Manco Capac, the dominion was extended about eight leagues from the city; and at the end of three centuries, it was e&s;tabli&s;hed fifteen hundred miles on the coa&s;t of the Pacific ocean; and from that ocean to the mountains of the Andes. During this period, through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of twelve monarchs, the original con&s;titution, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the fir&s;t Inca, remained unaltered; and was at la&s;t overturned by an acci|dent, which no human wi&s;dom could fore&s;ee or prevent.</P>
<P>For a more particular di&s;qui&s;ition on the character and in&s;titu|tions of this great Legi&s;lator, the Reader is referred to a di&s;&s;ertation prefixed to the third Book.</P>
<P>Mama Oella is &s;aid to have invented many of the dome&s;tic arts, particularly that of making garments of cotton and other vegetable &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>In the pa&s;&s;age preceding this reference, I have alluded to mo&s;t of the traditions, relating to the manner of their introducing them|&s;elves, and e&s;tabli&s;hing their dominion. In the remainder of the &s;econd, and through the whole of the third Book, I have given what may be &s;uppo&s;ed a probable narrative of their real origin and con|duct. I have thrown the epi&s;ode into an epic form, and given it &s;o con&s;iderable a place in the Poem, for the purpo&s;e of exhibiting <HI>in action</HI> the characters, manners and &s;entiments of the different tribes of &s;avages, that inhabit the mountains of South-America.</P>
<P>In reviewing this part of my &s;ubject, I have to lament, that &s;o extraordinary and meritorious a Poem, as the Araucana of don Alon&s;o de Ercilla, of the &s;ixteenth century, has never yet appeared in our language. The account given of that work by Voltaire ex|cited my curio&s;ity at an early day; as I conceived the manners and characters of the mountain &s;avages of Chile, as de&s;cribed by that heroic Spaniard, mu&s;t have opened a new field of Poetry, rich with uncommon ornaments.</P>
<P>That elegant and conci&s;e &s;ketch of it lately given to the pub|lic by Mr. Hayley, has come into my hands, &s;ince I have been writing the&s;e notes, and but a few days previous to the Poem's being put to the pre&s;s. Yet it gives me rea&s;on to hope, with every friend of literature, that the whole of that great work will ere long be pre&s;ented to the Engli&s;h Reader by the &s;ame hand.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ually pre&s;umed, that every Author mu&s;t have read all that have gone before him, at lea&s;t on &s;ubjects &s;imilar to what he at|tempts; yet the Lu&s;iad of Camoens, a Poem of great merit on the expedition of Gama, I had &s;ought for in vain in different parts of America, and even &s;ent to Europe without being able to obtain it; till, a few days &s;ince, it came to hand in the maje&s;tic and &s;pirited tran&s;lation of Mr. Mickle. The exten&s;ive and &s;ublime objects opened to our view in a work which celebrates the di&s;covery of one part of the globe, may well be thought worthy the contemplation of a writer, who endeavours to trace the con&s;equences of a &s;imilar event in another. Of this I was before &s;en&s;ible; but the&s;e are not the only di&s;advantages that an Author, in a new country, and in moderate circum&s;tances, mu&s;t have to encounter.</P></NOTE> and reform mankind.</L>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE GENIUS AND INSTITUTIONS OF MANCO CAPAC.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the original inhabitants of A|merica in general de&s;erve to be cla&s;&s;ed among the mo&s;t unimproved &s;avages that have ever been di&s;co|vered; yet the Mexican and Peruvian governments exhibit remarkable in&s;tances of order and regularity. In the difference of national character between the&s;e two empires, we may di&s;cern the influence of political &s;y&s;tems on the human mind; and infer the import|ance of the ta&s;k which a legi&s;lator undertakes, in at|tempting to reduce a barbarous people under the con|troul of government and laws. The Mexican con|&s;titution was formed to render its &s;ubjects brave and powerful; but, while it &s;ucceeded in this object, it tended to remove them farther from the real ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety, than they were, while in the rude&s;t &s;tate of nature. The hi&s;tory of the world affords no in&s;tance of men who&s;e manners were equally ferocious, and who&s;e &s;uper&s;tition was more bloody and unrelenting. On the contrary, the e&s;tabli&s;hments of Manco Capac carry the marks of a mo&s;t benevolent and pacific &s;y&s;tem; they tended to humanize the world and ren|der his people happy; while his ideas of the Deity were &s;o perfect, as to bear a compari&s;on with the en|lightened doctrines of Socrates or Plato.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed characters in hi&s;tory, who have been con&s;idered as legi&s;lators among bar|barous
<PB N="78" REF="020220_0074_0FAE453489E35B58">
nations, are Mo&s;es, Lycurgus, Solon, Numa, Mahomet and Peter of Ru&s;&s;ia. Of the&s;e, only the two former and the two latter appear really to de&s;erve that character. Solon and Numa po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not the means nor the opportunity of &s;hewing their talents in the bu&s;ine&s;s of original legi&s;lation. Athens and Rome were con&s;iderably advanced in civilization, before the&s;e characters aro&s;e. The mo&s;t they could do was to correct and amend con&s;titutions already formed. So|lon, in particular, may be con&s;idered as a wi&s;e politi|cian; but by no means as the founder of a nation. The Athenians were too far advanced in &s;ociety to admit any radical alteration in their form of govern|ment; if indeed any form can be &s;aid to exi&s;t, where every thing is left to the controul of a capricious multitude. The in&s;titutions of Numa were more ef|fective and durable; his religious ceremonies were, for many ages, the mo&s;t powerful check upon the li|centious and turbulent Romans. By inculcating a remarkable reverence for the Gods, and making it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult the Au&s;pices, when any thing im|portant was to be tran&s;acted, he rendered the popular &s;uper&s;tition &s;ub&s;ervient to the views of policy, and gave the &s;enate a &s;teady check upon the extravagance of the plebeans. But the con&s;titutions of Rome and Athens, however the &s;ubject of &s;o much injudicious applau&s;e, were never fixed upon any permanent prin|ciples; though the wi&s;dom of &s;ome of their rulers, and the &s;pirit of liberty that in&s;pired the people, ju&s;tly demand our admiration.</P>
<P>EACH of the other legi&s;lators above mentioned de|&s;erves a particular con&s;ideration; as acting in &s;tations &s;omewhat &s;imilar to that of the Peruvian lawgiver. Three objects are to be attended to, by the legi&s;lator of a barbarous people. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that his &s;y&s;tem be &s;uch as is capable of reducing the greate&s;t number of men under one juri&s;diction. <HI>Secondly,</HI> that it apply to &s;uch
<PB N="79" REF="020220_0075_0FAE453521D164F8">
principles in human nature for its &s;upport, as are uni|ver&s;al and permanent; in order to en&s;ure the duration of the government. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> that it admit of im|provements corre&s;pondent to any advancement in knowledge or variation of circum&s;tances, that may happen to its &s;ubjects; without endangering the prin|ciple of government, by &s;uch innovations. So far therefore as the &s;y&s;tems of tho&s;e legi&s;lators agree with the&s;e fundamental principles, they are worthy of re&s;|pect; and &s;o far as they deviate, they may be con&s;i|dered as defective and imperfect.</P>
<P>TO begin with Mo&s;es and Lycurgus; it is nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t place to ob&s;erve, that, in order to judge of the merit of any in&s;titutions, we mu&s;t take into view the peculiar character of the people for whom they were framed. For want of this attention, many of the laws of Mo&s;es have been ridiculed by ignorant &s;cep|tics, and many e&s;tabli&s;hments of Lycurgus cen&s;ured by as ignorant politicians. The Jews, who were led by Mo&s;es out of Egypt, were not only uncivilized, but, having ju&s;t ri&s;en to independence from a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, they united the manners of &s;ervants and &s;avages; and their national character is a compo&s;ition of &s;ervility and contumacy, ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition, filthine&s;s and cruelty. Of their cruelty as a people we need no other proof than the account of their avengers of blood, and the readine&s;s with which the whole con|gregation turned executioners and &s;toned to death the devoted offenders. The Lepro&s;y, a di&s;ea&s;e now whol|ly unknown, was undoubtedly produced by their to|tal want of cleanline&s;s, continued for &s;ucce&s;&s;ive genera|tions. In this view the frequent ablutions, the pecu|liar modes of trial, and many other in&s;titutions may be wholly vindicated from ridicule, and proved to be not only wi&s;e, but even nece&s;&s;ary regulations.</P>
<P>THE Spartan lawgiver has been equally cen&s;ured
<PB N="80" REF="020220_0076_0FAE4538567AF588">
for the toleration of theft and adultery. Among that race of Barbarians, the&s;e crimes were too general to admit of total prevention or univer&s;al puni&s;hment. By ve&s;ting all property in the community, in&s;tead of encou|raging theft, he removed the po&s;&s;ibility of the crime; and, in a nation where licentiou&s;ne&s;s was generally in|dulged, it was a great &s;tep towards introducing a purity of manners, to puni&s;h adultery in all ca&s;es, wherein the crime was not committed by the free con&s;ent of all parties injured or intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>THOSE con&s;titutions of government are be&s;t calcu|lated for immediate energy and duration, which are interwoven with &s;ome religious &s;y&s;tem. The legi&s;la|tor, who appears in the character of an in&s;pired per&s;on, renders his political in&s;titutions &s;acred, and intere&s;ts the con&s;cience as well as the judgement in their &s;up|port. The Jewi&s;h lawgiver had this advantage over the Spartan. He appeared not in the character of a mere earthly governor, but as an interpreter of the divine will. By injoining a religious ob&s;ervance of certain rites, he formed his people to habitual obedi|ence; by directing their cruelty again&s;t the breakers of the laws, he at lea&s;t mitigated the rancour of private hatred; by forbidding u&s;ury, and directing that real property &s;hould return to the original families in the year of Jubilee, he prevented too great an inequality of property; and by &s;electing a particular tribe, to be the guardians and interpreters of religion, he prevent|ed its my&s;teries from being the &s;ubject of profane and vulgar inve&s;tigation. To &s;ecure the permanency of his in&s;titutions, he prohibited any intercour&s;e with foreigners, by &s;evere re&s;trictions&punc; and formed his peo|ple to habits and a character di&s;agreeable to other na|tions; by which means any foreign intercour&s;e was prevented, from the mutual hatred of both parties.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e in&s;titutions the laws of Lycurgus bear a
<PB N="81" REF="020220_0077_0FAE45394895E810">
mo&s;t &s;triking re&s;emblance. The features of his con|&s;titution were &s;evere and forbidding; it was however calculated to in&s;pire the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic love of li|berty and martial honour. In no country was the patriotic pa&s;&s;ion more energetic than in Sparta; no laws ever excluded the idea of &s;eparate property in an equal degree, or in&s;pired a more thorough contempt for the manners of other nations. The utter prohibi|tion of money, commerce and almo&s;t every thing de|&s;irable to effeminate nations, entirely excluded fo|reigners from Sparta; and, while it in&s;pired the people with contempt for others, it rendered them agreeable to each other. By the&s;e means, Lycurgus rendered the nation powerful and warlike; and to in&s;ure the duration of his government he endeavoured to intere&s;t the con&s;ciences of his people, by the aid of oracles, and the oath he is &s;aid to have exacted from them, to obey his laws till his return; when he went into a volun|tary and perpetual exile.</P>
<P>FROM this view of the Jewi&s;h and Spartan in&s;titu|tions, applied to the principles above &s;tated, they ap|pear, in the two fir&s;t articles, con&s;iderably imperfect, and in the la&s;t, totally defective. Neither of them was calculated to bring any con&s;iderable territory or number of men under one juri&s;diction; from this cir|cum&s;tance alone, they could not be rendered perma|nent, as they mu&s;t be con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to their more powerful neighbours. But the third object of legi&s;|lation, that of providing for the future progre&s;s of &s;o|ciety, which, as it regards the happine&s;s of mankind, is the mo&s;t important of the three, was in both in&s;tan|ces entirely neglected. The&s;e &s;y&s;tems appear to have been formed with an expre&s;s de&s;ign to prevent all fu|ture improvement in knowledge, or enlargement of the human mind; and to fix tho&s;e nations forever in a &s;tate of ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition and barbari&s;m. To
<PB N="82" REF="020220_0078_0FAE4539AB6F1848">
vindicate the Spartan from an imputation of weakne&s;s or inattention in this particular, it may be urged that he was &s;urrounded by nations more powerful than his own; it was therefore impo&s;&s;ible for him to com|mence an e&s;tabli&s;hment upon any other plan. And Mo&s;es mu&s;t be vindicated upon this idea, that the di|vine moral law, which was de&s;igned, at a future peri|od, to regulate and harmonize the whole human race, mu&s;t be pre&s;erved in that nation, which was to give birth to the Saviour of mankind. If we allow him to have had a prophetic knowledge of the&s;e events, his in&s;titutions may be pronounced unexceptionable in every part.</P>
<P>THE in&s;titutions of Mahomet, are next to be con|&s;idered. The fir&s;t object of legi&s;lation appears to have been better under&s;tood by the Arabian Prophet, than by either of the preceding &s;ages; his juri&s;dic|tion was capable of being enlarged to any extent of territory, and governing any number of nations, that might be &s;ubjugated by his powerful and enthu&s;ia&s;tic armies; and to obtain this object his &s;y&s;tem of reli|gion was admirably calculated. Like Mo&s;es, he con|vinced his people that he acted as the vicegerent of Heaven; but with this capital advantage, adapting his religion to the natural feelings and propen&s;ities of mankind, he multiplied his followers, by the allure|ments of plea&s;ure and the promi&s;e of a &s;en&s;ual para|di&s;e. The&s;e circum&s;tances were likewi&s;e &s;ure to ren|der his con&s;titution permanent. His religious &s;y&s;tem was &s;o ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, &s;o &s;plendid and &s;o invit|ing, there could be no danger that the people would lo&s;e &s;ight of its principles, and no nece&s;&s;ity of future prophets, to explain the doctrines, or reform the na|tion. To the&s;e advantages if we add the exact and rigid military di&s;cipline, the &s;plendor and &s;acredne&s;s of the monarch, and that total ignorance of the people, which &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem will produce and perpetuate, the
<PB N="83" REF="020220_0079_0FAE453A69DC2408">
e&s;tabli&s;hment mu&s;t be evidently well calculated for extent and duration. But the la&s;t and mo&s;t import|ant end of government, that of mental improvement and &s;ocial happine&s;s, was deplorably lo&s;t in the in&s;ti|tution. And there was probably more learning and real genius in Arabia, in the days of this extraordina|ry character, than can now be found in all the Turk|i&s;h dominions.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the enterpri&s;ing genius of the Ru&s;&s;ian monarch appears to have been wholly bent on the arts of civilization, and the improvement of &s;ociety among his &s;ubjects. Happy in a legal title to a throne which already commanded a prodigious extent of country, he found that the fir&s;t object of govern|ment was already &s;ecured; and by applying him&s;elf with great &s;agacity and per&s;everance, to the third ob|ject, he was &s;ure that the &s;econd would be a nece&s;&s;ary and invariable con&s;equence. He effected his purpo|&s;es, important as they were, merely by the introduc|tion of the arts, and the encouragement of politer manners. The greatne&s;s of his genius appears not &s;o much in his in&s;titutions, which he copied from other nations, as in the extraordinary mea&s;ures he followed to introduce them, the judgement he &s;howed in &s;elect|ing and adapting them to the genius of his &s;ubjects, and his &s;urpri&s;ing a&s;&s;iduity and &s;ucce&s;s, by which he rai&s;ed a &s;avage people to a dignified rank among Eu|ropean nations. All his plans were formed to encou|rage the future progre&s;s of &s;ociety; and their dura|tion was en&s;ured by their obvious value and import|ance. His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have followed his political mea|&s;ures, with great attention to the &s;ame objects; and the pre&s;ent reigning empre&s;s has rendered her&s;elf not unworthy of &s;o high and honourable a de&s;cent.</P>

that of the Peruvian Lawgiver. It is probable that the &s;avages of Peru, before the time of Capac, among other objects of adoration, paid homage to the Sun. By availing him&s;elf of this popular &s;entiment, he ap|peared, like Mo&s;es and Mahomet, in the character of a divine legi&s;lator, endowed with &s;upernatural pow|ers. After impre&s;&s;ing the&s;e ideas &s;trongly on the minds of the people, drawing together a number of the tribes and rendering them &s;ub&s;ervient to his be|nevolent purpo&s;es, he applied him&s;elf to forming the outlines of a plan of policy, capable of founding and regulating an exten&s;ive empire; wi&s;ely calculated for perpetual duration; and expre&s;sly de&s;igned to im|prove the knowledge, peace and happine&s;s of a con&s;i|derable portion of mankind. In the apportionment of the lands, and the a&s;&s;ignment of real property, he invented a mode &s;omewhat re&s;embling the Feudal Sy&s;tem of Europe: yet this &s;y&s;tem was wi&s;ely check|ed in its operation, by a law &s;imilar to that of Mo&s;es, which regulated landed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the year of Ju|bilee. He divided the lands into three parts; the fir&s;t was con&s;ecrated to the u&s;es of religion, the &s;e|cond &s;et apart for the Inca and his family, to enable him to defray the expences of government and to ap|pear in the &s;tyle of a monarch, the third, and much the large&s;t portion, was allotted to the people; and this allotment was repeated every year, and varied ac|cording to the number and exigencies of each family.</P>
<P>AS the Incan family appeared in the character of Divinities, it was nece&s;&s;ary that a &s;ubordination of ranks &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed; in order to render the di&s;tinction between the monarch and his people more perceptible. With this view he created a band of Nobles, who were di&s;tingui&s;hed by per&s;onal and here|ditary honours. The&s;e were united to the monarch by the &s;tronge&s;t ties of intere&s;t; in peace they acted as Judges, and &s;uperintended the police of the empire,
<PB N="85" REF="020220_0081_0FAE453BE619E418">
in war they commanded in the armies. The next order of men were the re&s;pectable pea&s;antry of the country, who compo&s;ed the principal &s;trength of the nation. Below the&s;e was a cla&s;s of men, who were the &s;ervants of the public; who cultivated the public lands. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no property, and their only &s;ecurity depended on their regular indu&s;try and peace|able demeanour. Above all the&s;e orders, were the Inca and his family. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ab|&s;olute and uncontroulable power; his mandates were regarded as the word of Heaven, and the double guilt of impiety and rebellion attended on di&s;obedience. To impre&s;s the utmo&s;t veneration for the Incan family, it was a fundamental prin|ciple, that the royal blood &s;hould never be contami|nated by any foreign alliance. The my&s;teries of re|ligion were pre&s;erved &s;acred by the high prie&s;t of the royal family, under the controul of the king; and celebrated with rites, capaple of making the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the multitude. The annual di&s;tribu|tion of the lands, while it provided for the varying circum&s;tances of each family, &s;trengthened the bands of &s;ociety, by preventing the different orders from in|terfering with each other; the pea&s;ants could not vie with their &s;uperiors, and the Nobles could not be &s;ubjected by misfortune to a &s;ubordinate &s;tation. A con&s;tant habit of indu&s;try was inculcated upon all ranks by the &s;urprizing force of example and emula|tion. The cultivation of the &s;oil, which in mo&s;t other countries is con&s;idered as one of the lowe&s;t employ|ments, was here regarded as a divine art. Having had no idea of it before, and being taught it by the children of their God, the people viewed it as a &s;acred privilege, and con&s;idered it as an honour, to imitate and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Sun in opening the bo&s;om of the earth and producing vegetation. That the government might be able to exerci&s;e the endearing acts of be|nevolence, the produce of the public lands was re|&s;erved
<PB N="86" REF="020220_0082_0FAE453EF92092A0">
in magazines, to &s;upply the wants of the un|fortunate, as a depo&s;it for the people in times of gen|eral &s;carcity, and as a re&s;ource in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>THESE are the outlines of a government, the mo&s;t &s;imple and energetic conceivable, and capable of re|ducing the greate&s;t number of men under one juri&s;|diction; at the &s;ame time, accommodating its principle of action to every &s;tate of &s;ociety, and every &s;tage of improvement, by a &s;ingular and happy application to the pa&s;&s;ions of the human mind, it encouraged the ad|vancement of knowledge, without being endangered by &s;ucce&s;s. That &s;uch a government has a fair chance for perpetual duration is evident from this con&s;ideration, that a band of Nobles are ever the firm &s;upporters of regal authority; unle&s;s the monarch is &s;o limited in his power, that the Nobles de&s;pi&s;e his in|fluence. This could not be the ca&s;e in Peru; the Nobles were ju&s;tly proud of their elevated &s;tation, though they could have no ambition to controul the Inca. They were &s;en&s;ible that their intere&s;t was con|nected with that of the monarch; and, &s;uppo&s;ing the influence of religion to be out of the que&s;tion, they would not attempt to de&s;troy an in&s;titution on which their happine&s;s depended. A check equally effective was, by the con&s;titution of human nature, impo&s;ed on the Inca. Elevated above the competition and rival|&s;hip which corrode and torment the bo&s;oms of the great, he could have no ambition to gratify and no motive to induce him to an improper exerci&s;e of arbi|trary power.</P>
<P>IN the traits of character which di&s;tingui&s;h this in&s;titution, we may di&s;cern all the great &s;trokes of each of the legi&s;lators above mentioned. The pre|ten&s;ions of Capac to divine authority were as artfully contrived and as effectual in their con&s;equences, as tho&s;e of Mahomet; his exploding the wor&s;hip of evil
<PB N="87" REF="020220_0083_0FAE4540516AA610">
beings and objects of terror, forbidding human &s;acri|fices, inculcating more rational ideas of the Deity, and accommodating the rites of wor&s;hip to a God of ju&s;tice and benevolence, produced a greater change in the national character of his people, than any of the laws of Mo&s;es: Like Peter, he provided for the fu|ture improvement of &s;ociety; while his actions were never mea&s;ured upon the &s;mall and contracted &s;cale, which limited the genius of Lycurgus.</P>
<P>THUS far we find the political &s;y&s;tem of Capac at lea&s;t equal to tho&s;e of the mo&s;t celebrated ancient or modern lawgivers. But in one particular his charac|ter is placed beyond all compari&s;on; I mean for his religious in&s;titutions, and the ju&s;t ideas he had formed, by the unenlightened efforts of human wi&s;dom, of the nature and attributes of the Deity.</P>
<P>AND here I &s;hall premi&s;e, that idolatrous nations have never been guilty of tho&s;e glaring ab&s;urdities with which they are u&s;ually charged by the chri&s;tian world. The Per&s;ian or Peruvian, when he directed his adoration to the Sun, con&s;idered it as the place of re&s;idence for the unknown Deity, whom he wor|&s;hipped, and who communicated from thence the ble&s;&s;ings of light, warmth and vegetation; the Greek, who bowed at the &s;tatue of Jupiter, &s;uppo&s;ed it ani|mated with the pre&s;ence of his God; the Egyptian Apis, I&s;is and Orus, the calf, the leek and the onion, though the theme of univer&s;al ridicule to other nations, were, in their fir&s;t con&s;ecration, like the Jewi&s;h Cheru|bim, &s;ymbolical repre&s;entations of the nature and attri|butes of their Deities. No man ever erected a &s;tock or a &s;tone for a real object of wor&s;hip; but all igno|rant nations have paid their adoration before the &s;ym|bol of the Deity, in &s;ome &s;hape or other, and directed their homage to the place of his &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;idence. Even among enlightened nations, we find many traces
<PB N="88" REF="020220_0084_0FAE45418FC13BD0">
of the &s;ame ideas; the Papi&s;t bows to the Picture and the Crucifix; and the Methodi&s;t rolls up his eyes in prayer to the Sky. Perhaps una&s;&s;i&s;ted wi&s;dom can ri&s;e no higher; and the rea&s;on why idol wor&s;hip was forbid|den in the divine law, was not becau&s;e of the erroneous ideas of the original in&s;titutors, but becau&s;e the views of the vulgar, in proce&s;s of time, are apt to &s;top &s;hort at the intermediate object, and to lo&s;e &s;ight of the orig|inal invi&s;ible E&s;&s;ence. But the great crime of idola|trous nations con&s;i&s;ted in their a&s;cribing to the Deity the pa&s;&s;ions and attributes of the Devil, and in the horrid and murtherous rites of their wor&s;hip. Man|kind are more inclined to con&s;ider the Deity as a God of vengeance than a God of mercy. Even among chri&s;tians mo&s;t per&s;ons a&s;cribe afflictions to the hand of Heaven and pro&s;perity to their own merit and prudence. This principle operates in its full effect among &s;avages. They u&s;ually form no idea of a gen|eral &s;uperintending Providence; they con&s;ider not the Deity as the author of their beings, the Creator of the world and the di&s;pen&s;er of the happine&s;s they en|joy; they di&s;cern him not in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature, in the &s;un&s;hine and in the &s;hower, the productions of the earth and the ble&s;&s;ing of &s;ociety; they find a Dei|ty only in the &s;torm, the earthquake and the whirl|wind; or a&s;cribe to him the evils of pe&s;tilence and fa|mine; they con&s;ider him as interpo&s;ing in wrath to change the cour&s;e of nature, and exerci&s;ing the attri|butes of rage and revenge. They adore him with rites &s;uited to the&s;e attributes, with horror, with pe|nance and with &s;acrifice; they imagine him plea&s;ed with the &s;everity of their mortifications&punc; with the ob|lations of blood and the cries of human victims; and hope to compound for greater judgements, by volun|tary &s;ufferings and horrid &s;acrifices, &s;uited to the re|li&s;h of his ta&s;te.</P>
<P>PERHAPS no &s;ingle criterion can be given, which
<PB N="89" REF="020220_0085_0FAE45421429AEA0">
will determine more accurately the &s;tate of &s;ociety in any age or nation, than their general ideas concern|ing the nature and attributes of the Deity. In the mo&s;t enlightened periods of antiquity, only a very few of their wi&s;e&s;t Philo&s;ophers, a Socrates, a Tully, or a Confucius, ever formed a ju&s;t idea on the &s;ubject, or de&s;cribed the Deity as a God of purity, ju&s;tice and be|nevolence. Can any thing then be more a&s;toni&s;hing than to view a &s;avage native of the &s;outhern wilds of America, ri&s;ing in an age, void of every trace of learn|ing or refinement, and acquiring by the mere efforts of rea&s;on, a &s;ublime and rational idea of the Parent of the univer&s;e!</P>
<P>HE taught the nation to con&s;ider him as the God of order and regularity, a&s;cribing to his influence the rotation of the &s;ea&s;ons, the productions of the earth and the ble&s;&s;ings of health; e&s;pecially attributing to his in&s;piration the wi&s;dom of their laws and that hap|py con&s;titution, which was the delight and veneration of the people.</P>
<P>THESE humane ideas of religion had a &s;en&s;ible ope|ration upon the manners of the nation. They never began an offen&s;ive war with their &s;avage neighbours; and, whenever their country was invaded, they made war, not to extirpate, but to civilize. The conquered tribes and tho&s;e taken captive were adopted into the nation; and, by blending with the conquerors, forgot their former rage and ferocity.</P>
<P>A SYSTEM &s;o ju&s;t and benevolent, as might be ex|pected, was attended with &s;ucce&s;s. In about three hundred years, the dominions of the Incas had ex|tended fifteen hundred miles in length, and had in|troduced peace and pro&s;perity through the whole re|gion.
<PB N="90" REF="020220_0086_0FAE4542A97B0C90">
The arts of &s;ociety had been carried to a con|&s;iderable degree of improvement, and the authority of the Incan race univer&s;ally acknowledged; when an e|vent happened, that di&s;turbed the tranquility of the empire. Huana Capac, the twelfth monarch, had reduced the powerful kingdom of Quito, and annexed it to his empire. To conciliate the affections of his new &s;ubjects, he married a daughter of the ancient king of Quito. Thus, by violating a fundamental law of the Incas, he left at his death a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne. Atabalipa, the &s;on of Huana by the heire&s;s of Quito, being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the principal force of the Peruvian armies, which was left at that place on the death of his father, gave battle to his brother Hua&s;car, who was the elder &s;on of Huana by a lawful wife, and legal heir to the crown. After a long and de&s;tructive civil war, the former was victori|ous; and thus was that flouri&s;hing and happy king|dom left a prey to civil di&s;&s;entions, and to the few &s;oldiers of Pizarro, who happened at that juncture to make a di&s;cent upon their coa&s;t. Thus he effected an ea&s;y conque&s;t and an utter de&s;truction of that unfor|tunate people. It is however extremely obvious, that this deplorable event is not to be charged on Capac, as the con&s;equence of any defect in his in&s;titution. It is impo&s;&s;ible that any original legi&s;lator &s;hould effectu|ally guard again&s;t the folly of a futute &s;overeign. Capac had not only removed every temptation that could induce a wi&s;e prince to wi&s;h for a change in the con&s;titution, but had connected the ruin of his author|ity with the change; for he, who di&s;regards any part of in&s;titutions deemed &s;acred, teaches his people to con&s;ider the whole as an impo&s;ture. Had he made a law ordaining that the Peruvians &s;hould be ab&s;olved from their allegiance to a prince, who &s;hould violate the laws; it would evidently have implied po&s;&s;ible er|ror and imperfection in tho&s;e per&s;ons whom the people
<PB N="91" REF="020220_0087_0FAE45439B27BC88">
were ordered to regard as Divinities: the reverence due to characters who made &s;uch high preten&s;ions, would have been weakened; and, in&s;tead of rendering the con&s;titution perfect, &s;uch a law would have been its greate&s;t defect. Be&s;ides, it is probable the rupture might have been healed, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ettled, with as little difficulty as frequently happens with partial revolutions in other kingdoms; had not the de|&s;cent of the Spaniards prevented. And this event to a man in that age and country, was totally beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of human fore&s;ight. But viewing the con|currence of the&s;e fatal accidents, which reduced this flouri&s;hing empire to a level with many other ruined and departed kingdoms, it only proves that no human &s;y&s;tem has the privilege to be perfect.</P>
<P>ON the whole, it is evident, that the &s;y&s;tem of Ca|pac is the mo&s;t &s;urprizing exertion of human genius to be found in the hi&s;tory of mankind. When we con&s;ider him as an individual emerging from the mid&s;t of a barbarous people, having &s;een no po&s;&s;ible exam|ple of the operation of laws in any country, originat|ing a plan of religion and policy never equalled by the &s;ages of antiquity, civilizing an exten&s;ive empire, and rendering religion and government &s;ub&s;ervient to the general happine&s;s of mankind, there is no danger that we grow too warm in his prai&s;e, or pronounce too high an eulogium on his character. Had &s;uch a ge|nius appeared in Greece or Rome, he had been the &s;ubject of univer&s;al admiration; had he ari&s;en in the favourite land of Turkey, his prai&s;es had filled a thou&s;and pages in the diffu&s;ive writings of Voltaire.</P>

<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Since fini&s;hing the Poem (the whole of which, except a &s;mall part of the &s;eventh Book, was written previous to the conclu&s;ion of the late war) the Author is happy to find that his general ideas, re&s;|pecting the future progre&s;s and final perfection of human &s;ociety, are &s;upported by tho&s;e of &s;o re&s;pectable a Character as Dr. Price. In his Ob&s;ervations on the Importance of the American Revolution, he remarks,
<Q>That Rea&s;on, as well as Tradition and Revelation, lead us to expect that a more improved and happy &s;tate of hu|man affairs will take place before the final con&s;ummation of all things. The world has been hitherto gradually improving; light and knowledge have been gaining ground, and human life at pre&s;ent, compared with what it <HI>once</HI> was, is much the &s;ame that a youth approaching to manhood is, compared with an in|fant.</Q></P>
<P>It has long been the opinion of the Author, that &s;uch a &s;tate of peace and happine&s;s as is foretold in &s;cripture and commonly called the millennial period, may be rationally expected to be introduced without a miracle. <HI>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> ni&s;i dignus vindice nodus,</HI> is a maxim, as u&s;eful to a Chri&s;tian Philo&s;opher as to a Heathen Poet. Although, from the hi&s;tory of mankind, it appears, that the pro|gre&s;s of improvement has be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ow and often interrupted, yet it gives plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve the cau&s;es of the&s;e interruptions, and to di&s;cern the end they were de&s;igned in the cour&s;e of Providence to an&s;wer, in accelerating the &s;ame events, which they &s;eemed for a|while to retard. The &s;tate of the arts among the ancients, viewed with reference to the event under con&s;ideration, was faulty or ra|ther unfortunate in two particulars; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> in their comparative e&s;|timation; and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> in their not flouri&s;hing in more than one nation at a time. The&s;e circum&s;tances were highly favourable to the exertions of individual genius, and may be a&s;&s;igned both as cau&s;es of the univer&s;al de&s;truction of the arts by the Gothic conque&s;t, and as rea&s;ons why we &s;hould not greatly lament that de&s;truction. From the &s;ituation of mankind in the days of ancient literature, it was natural that tho&s;e arts which depend on the imagination, &s;uch as Architecture, Statuary, Painting, Eloquence and Poetry, &s;hould claim the highe&s;t rank in the e&s;timation of a people. In &s;everal, and perhaps all of the&s;e, the ancients remain unrivaled. But the&s;e are not the arts which tend greatly to the general improve|ment of mankind. The man, who in tho&s;e days could have a&s;cer|tained the true figure of the earth, would have rendered more &s;er|vice to the world, than he that could originate a heaven and fill it with all the Gods of Homer; and had the expences of the Egyptian pyramids been employed in furni&s;hing fleets of di&s;covery, to be &s;ent out of the Mediterranian, the civilized world would probably never have been ov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rrun by Barbarians. But the &s;ciences of Ge|ography, Navigation and Commerce, with all their con&s;equential improvements in natural philo&s;ophy and humanity, could not, from the nature of things, be objects of great encouragement or enter|prize among the ancients. They therefore turned their attention to the cultivation of arts more &s;triking to the &s;en&s;es; &s;uch as re|quire the &s;tronge&s;t exertion of the human genius, and would be en|titled to the highe&s;t rank in any age of univer&s;al refinement. As the&s;e arts were adapted to gratify the vanity of a prince, to fire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ambition of a hero, or to gain a point in a popular a&s;&s;embly&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were carried to a degree of perfection, which prevented their being reli&s;hed or under&s;tood by barbarians. The literature of the world therefore de&s;cended with the line of conque&s;t from one nation to another, till the whole was &s;wallowed up in the Roman Empire. There its tendency was to in&s;pire a contempt for nations le&s;s civil|ized, and to induce the Romans to con&s;ider all mankind as the objects of their in&s;ult, and all countries as the &s;cenes of their mili|tary parade. The&s;e circum&s;tances, through a cour&s;e of ages, pre|pared and finally opened a &s;cene of wretchedne&s;s, at which the hu|man mind has been taught to &s;hudder, but it was wi&s;ely calculated to reduce mankind to a &s;ituation, capable of commencing regular and exten&s;ive improvements. And, however novel the &s;entiment may appear, yet the Author will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that, as to the pro&s;|pect of univer&s;al civilization, mankind were in a much more eligi|ble &s;ituation in the time of Charlemagne than they were in the days of Augu&s;tus. The final de&s;truction of the Roman empire left the nations of Europe in circum&s;tances &s;imilar to each other; and their con&s;equent rival&s;hip prevented any di&s;proportionate refinement from appearing in any particular region. The &s;eeds of govern|ment, firmly rooted in the principles of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, laid the foundation of that balance of Power, which di&s;courages the Cae&s;ars and Alexanders of mankind from attempting the conque&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>It &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, that the arrangement of events in civilizing the world &s;hould be in the following order. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> all parts of it mu&s;t be con&s;iderably peopled; <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> the different nations mu&s;t be known to each other; and <HI>thirdly,</HI> their imaginary wants mu&s;t be increa&s;ed, in order to in&s;pire a pa&s;&s;ion for commerce. The fir&s;t of the&s;e objects, was probably not accompli&s;hed till a late period. The &s;econd, for three centuries pa&s;t, has been greatly accelerated, but is now very far from being completely obtained. The third is al|ways a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the two former. The &s;pirit of commerce is happily calculated by the Author of wi&s;dom to open an amicable intercour&s;e between all countries, to &s;often the horrors of war, to enlarge the field of &s;cience and &s;peculation, and to a&s;&s;i|milate the manners, feelings and languages of all nations. This leading principle, in its remoter con&s;equences, will produce a thou|&s;and advantages in favour of government and legi&s;lation, give Pa|trioti&s;m the air of Philanthropy, induce all men to regard each oth|er as brethren and friends, eradicate all kinds of literary, religious and political &s;uper&s;tition, prepare the minds of all mankind for the rational reception of moral and religious truth, and finally evince that &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of Providence, as appears in the unfolding of the&s;e events, is the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;y&s;tem to produce the happine&s;s of creatures. I conceive it is no objection to this plan, that the pro|gre&s;s has hitherto been &s;low; when we con&s;ider the va&s;t magnitude of the object, the ob&s;tructions to be removed, and the great length of time that will probably be taken to accompli&s;h it. To re&s;ume the compari&s;on of Doctor Price, perhaps the world can hardly be &s;aid as yet to be "approaching to manhood"; probably we are rather ri&s;ing out of infancy; we have not yet been able to wander over the whole hou&s;e and ob&s;erve upon the furniture. It is po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome con&s;iderable revolutions are yet to happen, before the progre&s;s will be entirely free from embarra&s;ments. But the gener|al &s;y&s;tem appears &s;o rational and complete, that it furni&s;hes a new &s;ource of &s;atisfaction, in contemplating the apparent di&s;pen&s;ations of Heaven.</P>
<P>The author fir&s;t ventured upon the&s;e ideas, in the cour&s;e of the Poem, with all the timidity of youth; determining not to ri&s;k a &s;e|rious illu&s;tration of the &s;entiment in pro&s;e. But finding that a theo|ry &s;o plea&s;ing to him&s;elf has not been unnoticed by others, he feels a greater confidence in the &s;ubject, and hopes the importance of it will apologize to the reader for &s;o lengthy a note.</P></NOTE>And one wide intere&s;t &s;ways the peaceful race.</L>
