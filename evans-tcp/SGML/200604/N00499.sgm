<P>A<HI>Ltho' the Great</HI> Austin, <HI>once entred it among his Aged and Humble</HI> Retra|ctations, <HI>That in a Dedication of a Book, unto one, whom be yet Esteem|ed,</HI> A Good Man, <HI>he had spoken more Honou|rably of that Person, than be deserved; I am abundantly satisfy'd, That I shall never have cause to</HI> Retract <HI>my Dedicating of this Little Book unto you, as unto a Person,</HI> Most Exem|plarily desirous to serve Your Country, and as Exemplarily Self-denying in the doing of that Service. <HI>The World surely must be now convinced, That we were not at all deceived in our Expectations, when we publickly Saluted You some years ago, As,</HI> One Rais'd by God, for such a Time as This! <HI>And your People would now be the most Ungrateful of Men, if they should not acknowledge, That your Indefatigable

Endeavours to Do us Good, have more than a Little oblig'd us, to Thank you, to Value you, to Honour you, and to</HI> Pray <HI>for you. But as you have often expressed your Esteem for the</HI> Pray|ers <HI>of such men as now Rejoyce under your Pro|tection; so the</HI> Sermons <HI>uttered among them, have had a singular Acceptance with you. 'Tis upon this encouragement, that I now ask</HI> Your Excellency, <HI>to Accept of a Sermon, which de|scribes,</HI> An Excellent Spirit; <HI>a</HI> Spirit <HI>no less Needful than Useful in all sorts of men; but es|pecially in those who on the score of any prefer|ments do</HI> Excel <HI>other men; even, that</HI> Spirit, <HI>whereof whoever shall be destitute, may have this Lamentation made upon them,</HI> Does not the Excellency which is in them, Go away?

<P>SIR,</P>
<P><HI>The Charming</HI> Examples <HI>of such an</HI> Excellent Spirit, <HI>are plentifully exhibited in those</HI> Judges <HI>wherewith our God favoured his</HI> Israel, <HI>of old. But having recommended</HI> Them, <HI>as the Cheef and Best Subjects for your pious</HI> Emulation, <HI>it will not be amiss, if I also set before</HI> Your Ex|cellency, <HI>the instance of a Noble Roman as truly admirable. T'was the Renowned</HI> Fabius Max|imus; <HI>Who being advanc'd unto the Highest Of|fice and Command in the Common-Wealth, did through a zeal for his Country, overcome the grea|test affronts that any person of quality could have received.</HI> Minutius <HI>the master of the horse, &amp; the

<HEAD>GOOD MEN Described. In a Sermon, Directed unto the GOVERNOUR, of NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL><HI>PROV. XVII. XXVII.</HI></BIBL>
<Q><HI>A Man of Understanding, is of an EXCEL|LENT SPIRIT.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was a Sharp, and yet a Just, Rebuke which the Rash and Wild Zeal of Our Lords own Disciples, once brought upon Them, in <HI>Luc.</HI> 9. 55. <HI>Yee know not what manner of Spirit yee are of.</HI> As 'tis not easy for a man to pass a Judgement upon his own <HI>Picture,</HI> So for a man to know his own <HI>Spirit,</HI> is a thing no less <HI>Difficult,</HI> than it is <HI>Uncommon</HI> in the world. Men may Dream that they have, no less a thing, than <HI>The Powerful or Glorious Spirit of Elias</HI> in them, when indeed, those <HI>Evil Spirits,</HI> which filled and acted the <HI>Swine</HI> of old, have possession of them. It is the <HI>Spirit</HI> of man, whereof he that <HI>Formed</HI> it, hath said, <HI>It is Deceitful above all things, who can
<PB N="2" REF="000623_0008_0FA95ED4C07821E8">
know it?</HI> And therefore that Counsil of Hea|ven, <HI>Try the Spirits,</HI> is of a very wonderful importance to us all; Especially with refer|ence unto <HI>Our own.</HI> But if that be a Questi|on which would puzzle the most among us, <HI>What Spirit are you of?</HI> There is another Question, which is not altogether so intricate, so perplexed; Namely, <HI>What Spirit we should be of?</HI> It is a Question, whereto we have an Answer, in the Text now Read unto us. We are told in <HI>Prov.</HI> 12. 26. <HI>The Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour.</HI> And our Text showes, Wherein? tis in the <HI>Spirit</HI> of him.</P>
<P>If the very <HI>Title</HI> of the <HI>Proverbs</HI> in our Bibles, did not intimate, that they were <HI>Ex|cellent Sentences,</HI> yet the <HI>Author,</HI> the <HI>Pen-Man,</HI> the <HI>Matter,</HI> and the <HI>Te<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ure,</HI> would all con|spire to declare their being so. It is then an <HI>Excellent Sentence</HI> which now lies before us; and an <HI>Excellent Spirit</HI> is the thing recommen|ded in it. We are told in I <HI>King.</HI> 10 24. <HI>All the earth sought unto</HI> Solomon, <HI>to hear his wise|dom, which God had put into his Heart.</HI> But be|hold, something of that <HI>Wisdome</HI> now seeks unto a Little <HI>Part of the earth</HI> within these walls this day, that we would attend unto it.</P>
<P>Wee have here a description of a <HI>Wise Man,</HI> which the only <HI>Wise GOD put into the Heart,</HI> of One that was himself such a Man. To be too Sollicitous and Inquisitive after the Aspect,
<PB N="3" REF="000623_0009_0FA95ED4D41D3350">
which these words may bear unto the Con|text, will be to forget the Independency of the Sacred <HI>Proverbs,</HI> which rather ly toge|ther like an heap of <HI>Unstrung Pearls,</HI> in the Book of our GOD. Nevertheless, tis plain that <HI>Solomon</HI> is here commending the <HI>Taciturnity,</HI> which Wise Men usually have a kindness for; and we have this, assigned as the <HI>Reason</HI> of the <HI>Silence,</HI> that is affected by such Men as those; Particularly, when they receive great provocations from their Injurious Neighbours, and are punished, even for their <HI>Justice,</HI> or <HI>Strucken</HI> for their <HI>Equity;</HI> How come they to be <HI>Sparing of their words!</HI> Why, they are of an <HI>Excellent Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>But referring all those Observations, which may be made upon the <HI>Circumstances</HI> of this Text, unto the place most proper for them, I shall, with Gods Help, Address my Self to Answer this most important CASE. <HI>What is that</HI> EXCELLENT SPIRIT, <HI>which a Good man desires, &amp; studies to be a|dorned with!</HI></P>
<P>Divines of some Note, have still wished for Sermons, whose <HI>Motto's</HI> might be, <HI>Many Truth's, and not many words.</HI> It would be disagreeable to the Composure of the <HI>Pro|verbs</HI> from whence my Text is taken, and my <HI>Context</HI> would give me a very particular
<PB N="4" REF="000623_0010_0FA95ED5B40D9790">
Check if I should not Croud what is to be said upon this <HI>Case,</HI> into as <HI>Little Room</HI> as ever I can. To Discourse Closely then,</P>
<P>By the <HI>Spirit,</HI> is meant the <HI>Soul;</HI> Or, that Spiritual and Rational <HI>Substance,</HI> whereto our <HI>Body</HI> is to be Vitally United, as a <HI>Man|sion</HI> and an <HI>Engine</HI> for it. By the <HI>Excellency</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> is meant some <HI>Ornament</HI> upon the Soul, which may be grateful unto the most High God, and graceful in the Eyes of all Reasonable men. We are therefore to Enquire, What are those <HI>Ornaments,</HI> with which a Good man would have his own <HI>Soul</HI> Accomplished?</P>
<P>Know then,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> An <HI>Excellent Spirit</HI> is an E<HI>xtraordinary Spirit;</HI> and such would a Good man have his own <HI>Spirit</HI> arise to be. We Look upon <HI>Rarity</HI> and <HI>Excellency</HI> to be AEquivalent Why, a <HI>Good</HI> man will always be a <HI>Rare</HI> man, as long as almost the whole <HI>World Lies in Wickedness;</HI> But he will further aspire after those <HI>Rare</HI> Attainments, which even many a <HI>Good</HI> man do's not arrive unto. No, he would in all that is Vertuous and Laudable be, <HI>An Extraordinary man.</HI> There is a Com|mendable <HI>Singularity</HI> Endeavoured by such a man; and he will not be <HI>Bark'd</HI> out of it, by such Flouts and Scoffs, as they some times assaulted the Great <HI>Luther</HI> with, <HI>Tune
<PB N="5" REF="000623_0011_0FA95ED659248600">
Solns Sapis?</HI> Is there no Wit, no Sense a|mong Mankind, but what <HI>you</HI> have mono|polized? A Good man, will not oblige himself unto the Common measures of <HI>Ini|quity.</HI> There are <HI>Ordinary Vices,</HI> which, be sure, a Good man will not comply withal; he ha's not a <HI>Spirit</HI> that will permit him, <HI>To follow a multitude in the Doing of evil:</HI> if he dwell in a <HI>Sodom,</HI> hell be a <HI>Lot</HI> for all. When the whole Congregation had been Sinning against God, said the Lord in Num. 14.24. <HI>My Servant Caleb, he had another Spi|rit, and hath followed me fully.</HI> Tis that <HI>other Spirit,</HI> that is an <HI>Excellent Spirit.</HI> Suppose, a Whole Country, yea, a whole Nation, be distempered with Formality, Debauchery, and Enmity against the <HI>Right wayes of the Lord,</HI> a Good man will be of <HI>Another Spirit;</HI> although like E<HI>lias</HI> he be put upon Com|plaining, <HI>I am left alone!</HI> If a whole peo|ple decline and back-slide from God, and let the <HI>World</HI> eat up all their <HI>Zeal for the House of the Lord;</HI> Yet a Good man will be of <HI>Another Spirit;</HI> hee'l be another <HI>Noah</HI> for his Uprightness, though there be a <HI>Deluge</HI> of Profaneness, overwhelming of all his Neigh|bourhood. He is one bound for Heaven; and thinks he, <HI>To heaven Il'e go, though I should not have one man alive, to bear me Company.</HI> But there are <HI>Ordinary Vertues</HI> too, with
<PB N="6" REF="000623_0012_0FA95ED71C27EE78">
which a Good man will not be Satisfy'd; he will ingenuously confess himself to be, <HI>The least of Saints;</HI> but he will diligently La|bour to be one of the <HI>Highest Form;</HI> to be <HI>Ultimus Bonorum,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ill not serve his turn; he ha's a <HI>Spirit</HI> suited by that Advice of the Apostle, <HI>Seek that ye may Excel.</HI> Said our Lord, in Math.5.47. <HI>What do you more than others?</HI> Tis a Spirit for <HI>Doing more than o|thers,</HI> that is the <HI>Excellent Spirit.</HI> To Live Soberly, and Honestly, Doing no body any Harm, and to keep up a Round of Duties from Sabbath to Lecture, and from Lecture to Sabbath, here is what <HI>others,</HI> that are none of the worst, use to do; but a Good man is for <HI>Doing more than others.</HI> He is for Doing <HI>Nobler things</HI> than they do; and for doing the same things which they do, upon far <HI>Nobler ends.</HI> As for <HI>Natural</HI> Actions; his Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, and Recreation; tis not meerly because he is <HI>Hungry, Thirsty, Weary,</HI> and his <HI>Appetites</HI> call for it; this is what <HI>others do;</HI> No, but it is, that so he may be Supported and Refreshed in the work of God. As for <HI>Civil Actions;</HI> his Trading, Ploughing, Working, and Visitati|on; it is not barely to accommodate him|self with <HI>Worldly Advantages;</HI> that is what <HI>others do;</HI> No, but it is to Glorify God in the station wherein God has placed him.
<PB N="7" REF="000623_0013_0FA95ED7CBAE0550">
And then, in his <HI>Religious Actions,</HI> a Good man, would have more <HI>Piety</HI> and more <HI>Cha|rity,</HI> than other men. <HI>Others</HI> have some <HI>Faith;</HI> but he would have such an one as <HI>Abraham</HI> had; others have some <HI>Love;</HI> but he would have such an one as <HI>David</HI> had. Others have some <HI>Repentance,</HI> but he would have such an one as <HI>Peter</HI> had. <HI>Others</HI> do something for God; but he would be able to say with <HI>Paul, I have Laboured more abun|dantly than they all!</HI> Of Good men, tis said, in Isa. 40.31. <HI>They shall mount up with Wings as</HI> E<HI>agles.</HI> Truly, A Good man is for <HI>High|Flights</HI> in Religion; he would fain Soar a|bove the <HI>middle Region;</HI> Yea, he would, if it might be, come to move with and like the very <HI>Angels</HI> themselves, who you know, are called E<HI>xcellent Spirits.</HI> He hopes he shall one Day come to be, <HI>As the Angels;</HI> and therefore he would now be of such an <HI>An|gelical Spirit,</HI> that the very <HI>Angels</HI> themselves may take Delight in attending on him. As for that Creeping Frame of some, who would gladly know the <HI>Minimum quod Sic,</HI> or, just how much Religion will set a man within the Gates of Heaven, that they may there make a Stop and Stand; I think, tis Incom|patible to a Godly man.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II. Holiness</HI> is <HI>Excellence;</HI> and that is
<PB N="8" REF="000623_0014_0FA95ED9CE4A1C90">
it with which a good man would have a <HI>Spi|rit</HI> most gloriously Replenished. We are told in Psal. 16. 3. <HI>The Saints that are in the Earth, are the</HI> E<HI>xcellent.</HI> The Spirit of a SAINT is an E<HI>xcellent Spirit.</HI> I know not whether he be most of a <HI>Bruit</HI> or a <HI>Devil;</HI> 'tis <HI>one</HI> of them; that shall make a <HI>Scoff</HI> at being a <HI>Saint;</HI> tho' that be a wickedness that has been committed, by some that would be called <HI>Christians.</HI> But a Good Man, is very desirous to be, A <HI>Saint on</HI> E<HI>arth,</HI> &amp; one of the, <HI>Holy Brethren,</HI> Indeed the Inclination of many, is too agreeable to the Popish <HI>Canonization:</HI> which acknow|ledges no <HI>Saints,</HI> but what are already in the Heaven of the Blessed. We do but humour <HI>that,</HI> when we do say, <HI>Saint Mat|thew,</HI> and won't as well say, <HI>Saint Abra|ham.</HI> But we do more grosly follow it, when we are for no <HI>Saintship,</HI> till we are dead and gone, and we are, <HI>Like Sheep laid in the Grave.</HI> Whereas, A good man is for being, <HI>A Saint on</HI> E<HI>arth;</HI> inasmuch as he believes, 'tis that, <HI>Without which, No man shall see the Lord.</HI> But <HI>Holiness;</HI> What is that? It is in short, <HI>A Consecration to the Service and Glory of the Great God. God</HI> Holiness is His Advancing of Himself a|lone, and his Agreeing with none but such as concur with him in doing so. And
<PB N="9" REF="000623_0015_0FA95EDC143AA278">
thus <HI>our</HI> Holiness, lies in our Advancing the Honour of God, and making all that we <HI>are,</HI> and all that we <HI>have,</HI> and all that we <HI>do,</HI> subservient thereunto. New a good man, would be such a <HI>Saint,</HI> as thus to have, <HI>Holiness unto the Lord,</HI> written upon all that he is concerned in; he does like those worthy <HI>Macedonians,</HI> of whom we read, <HI>They gave themselves unto the Lord;</HI> and then he subscribes himself, as in <HI>Psal.</HI> 119. 38. <HI>Lord, I am thy Servant, Devoted unto thy Fear.</HI> A Spirit of <HI>Respect unto God,</HI> has touched him; and being a Needle touched with such a Loadstone, he would always have none but <HI>God-ward Vergencies</HI> of Soul. A good man, would be an E<HI>noch,</HI> that is to say, <HI>A Dedicated man;</HI> and he would, <HI>Walk with God,</HI> by a Continual <HI>De|dication</HI> of every thing within his Reach, un|to that Great END of, <HI>Showing forth the Praises of God.</HI> We are Commanded, in I Cor.6. 20. <HI>Glorify God in your Bodies, and in your Spirits, which are His.</HI> The <HI>Spirit</HI> of a Good man says, <HI>Amen</HI> to this! We are Commanded, in I Cor.10.31. <HI>Whether ye Eat, or Drink, or whatever ye do, Do all to the Glory of God.</HI> The <HI>Spirit</HI> of a Good man, cryes out, <HI>Lord, Let me do so!</HI> He is a man that would set a part every thing for <HI>God;</HI> and Subordinate every thing about
<PB N="10" REF="000623_0016_0FA95EDCF4A5E3D8">
him, unto the Interests of the Lord. If the <HI>Flesh</HI> and the <HI>World,</HI> and the <HI>Divel,</HI> tempt him, to do any thing that may be for the Dishonour of God, he would make <HI>Jo|sephs</HI> Refusal, <HI>How shall I do this wickedness, and sin against God?</HI> But here is not all; he ha's a <HI>Spirit</HI> for more than this. What <HI>Ahab</HI> so sneakingly and absurdly, said unto <HI>Benhadad,</HI> in I King.20. 4 <HI>I am thine, my Lord, and all that I have; That</HI> would a Good man very Holily speak unto the God that made him; <HI>Let my all be the Lords.</HI> When he looks upon the <HI>Powers</HI> of his <HI>Mind,</HI> he says, <HI>O that this Understanding, this Co|gitation, this Conscience, and this Memory, might alwayes be at Work for God;</HI> and, <HI>O that this Will, and these Affections, might alwayes be closing with God my Saviour.</HI> When he Looks upon the <HI>Members</HI> of his <HI>Body,</HI> he says, <HI>O that all my Senses might Operate for God alone; and, O that this Tongue might speak for God, and these Hands Acts for God, and these Feet carry me where God is to be serv|ed.</HI> Yea, As we read, in Psal.30. Tit. about, <HI>The Dedication of the House of David;</HI> even so, a Good man, would have no <HI>Comfort,</HI> by which Gods <HI>Glory</HI> should not be promo|ted. His <HI>House,</HI> His <HI>Cash,</HI> His Lands, His Goods, His Friends, and all His Capacities, he Wishes, <HI>O that my God might have the
<PB N="11" REF="000623_0017_0FA95EDD157B5FD8">
more Acknowledgments for my having such things as these!</HI> And therefore also, he sometimes does ask himself, like <HI>David</HI> of old: he does more particularly ask himself, <HI>O what is there that I may do for the Dear Name of my God?</HI> This note is the <HI>Spirit of Holiness</HI> in a good man; and whatever O|pinion the Debauched and Vitiated Souls of unrenewed <HI>Sinners,</HI> may have concern|ing it, if all the <HI>Angels</HI> that are now Invisi|bly present here, had it referred unto them, I am sure they would all say, <HI>This is an excel|lent Spirit!</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> A good man would be of an <HI>Active</HI> and an <HI>Useful</HI> Spirit, and that is an <HI>Excellent</HI> One. What we render, <HI>Excellent</HI> here, may be rendred <HI>Precious.</HI> A good man would be such a <HI>Jewel</HI> to his Neighbours, as that they should all fare the better for him; he would give them cause to say concerning him, while he lives, <HI>He is a precious man;</HI> and when he Dyes, <HI>There's one gone that will he miss'd!</HI> It was said concerning one that was an Active and an Useful Instru|ment for the good of His People, in 2 <HI>Sam</HI> 18. 3. <HI>Thou art worth ten thousand of us.</HI> Why, a good man would make himself of <HI>much Use</HI> to as many Thousands of his Neighbours, as he can; and if this will
<PB N="12" REF="000623_0018_0FA95EDDE7189B20">
make him of <HI>More Worth</HI> than many thou|sands of them, he will be so. It is noted of a <HI>Sheep,</HI> that every thing about it, is of some good use or other. A good man is a <HI>Sheep</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, the <HI>She|pherd of Israel;</HI> and he would have some good <HI>Use</HI> made of whatever God has given him. Indeed, this is the proper Distincti|on and Character of a <HI>Good Man,</HI> as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 7. oppos'd unto a <HI>Righteous</HI> one; 'tis a Man, who, <HI>Does Good.</HI> A good man will be an Excellent Husband and Steward of the <HI>Talents,</HI> which God has bestow'd upon him; and put 'em all to an <HI>Excellent Use.</HI> He would fain be, as it was noted of the Blessed <HI>Bradford;</HI> E<HI>ither with Tongue, or Pen, or Purse, always doing of Good.</HI> Per|haps he seldome comes into any Company but he thinks with himself, <HI>What useful thing shall I Say or Do, before we part?</HI> There are several <HI>Relations,</HI> which the God of Hea|ven has placed him in; and he would so discharge those <HI>Relations,</HI> that all about him should Bless God for ever for him; he would procure <HI>those Praises</HI> to make Heaven ring every day on his behalf, <HI>Bles|sed be God for such a Magistrate, for such a Minister, for such a Father, such a Master, such an Husband, or such a Son!</HI> All his <HI>Gifts,</HI> and all his <HI>Graces,</HI> and all his <HI>Capacities</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="000623_0019_0FA95EE05FF5F9F0">
he would so lay out, that the Church of God, may have the Advantage of them. And, if you can but evidently lay before him, <HI>An opportunity to be Serviceable,</HI> you need not use many Motives to make him take it: no, thinks he, <HI>My Opportunities are my Treasures!</HI> His <HI>Riches,</HI> if God have sent him any, how does he Employ a good por|tion of them? It was said, <HI>If Riches In|crease, set not your Hearts upon them;</HI> instead of <HI>That,</HI> he <HI>sets his Heart</HI> upon Contriving what <HI>Good</HI> he shall do with what he has? 'Tis said in <HI>Isa.</HI> 32. 8. <HI>He does Devise Libe|ral Things.</HI> He sets himself to <HI>Devise</HI> how he may support sacred and civil Order, how he may set the poor to work, how he may feed the Hungry, clothe the Naked, Re|lieve the Sick, Comfort and Requite his Pa|rents, and make the Heart of the Aged, the Widow, and the Orphan, Sing for Joy. And hence also, He is a man of a <HI>Publick</HI> S<HI>pirit.</HI> He is not all for <HI>Himself,</HI> but he earns that Epitaph to be inscrib'd upon his Grave at last, <HI>Here lies a Good Common|Wealths Man!</HI> and while he lives he is con|cern'd for the whole <HI>Vessel,</HI> as well as his own <HI>Cabin;</HI> especially when an Horrible Storm does Threaten all. When that Ex|cellent Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> the Ancestor of our present Soveraign, had from
<PB N="14" REF="000623_0020_0FA95EE332F1BF80">
a Treacherous and Murderous Papist re|ceived such a mortal wound, that he saw he had but one Breath to draw in the World, he cry'd out, <HI>O my God, have mercy on my Soul, and on my poor people!</HI> His <HI>poor People!</HI> had half of his last Breath. Truly, so, a Good Man would let his <HI>poor People,</HI> have more than <HI>Half</HI> of all that he has, when it <HI>must</HI> and <HI>can</HI> be afforded unto them. Be sure, he will not grumble at e|very penny that goes to defray, the <HI>Publick Charges,</HI> while he can throw away whole Pounds on his own <HI>private Pleasures.</HI> Nor will he needlesly and angrily Decline to Serve the <HI>Publick,</HI> when he has a clear Call unto it. Tho' a sense of <HI>Inability</HI> may make him very backward in accepting of an <HI>Office;</HI> yet if he be <HI>Able</HI> he will be <HI>Willing</HI> to do his best. It is true, every <HI>Publick Servant</HI> must carry two <HI>Handkerchiefs</HI> about him, one to wipe off <HI>Sweat,</HI> of Travail, another to wipe off the <HI>Spit</HI> of Reproach, but a Good Man, has his <HI>Handkerchief</HI> al|ways at hand. It is possible, that the <HI>Poor People,</HI> have been shamefully <HI>Ungrateful</HI> to him, for what he has already done; but their being <HI>Ungrateful</HI> shall not make him <HI>Unuseful;</HI> he Looks for his Rewards, not in the <HI>Acclamations</HI> of a fickle and froward people, but in the Great Gods, <HI>Well done

Good and Faithful Servant!</HI> he can pass by their Little Follies, and still spend his Time and Strength, and Estate for them; even, <HI>To do them good against their Wills;</HI> as every one must, that will do them <HI>good</HI> at all. In <HI>Serviceableness,</HI> He is, <HI>Like the Lion, which turneth not away for any.</HI> It is required in Gal.6. 10. <HI>As we have opportunity, let us do Good unto all men.</HI> And that which the Good Man says upon it, is, <HI>Lord, give me opportunities, and an heart with my opportuni|ties.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> A Good Man would have an <HI>Excel|lent Breath,</HI> and that is both a symptom and an Instance of an <HI>Excellent Spirit.</HI> By <HI>Spi|rit</HI> here, <HI>Breath</HI> may be one thing intended; as 'tis in some other places. Now a man, of an <HI>Excellent Breath,</HI> imports much as a man of an E<HI>xcellent Speech.</HI> And therefore 'tis added in our Context here, H<HI>e that hath Knowledge, spareth his words.</HI> We read in <HI>Prov.</HI> 17.7. concerning, E<HI>xcellent</HI> S<HI>peech.</HI> Why, such would a good man, have his own S<HI>peech</HI> to be. He says, with the Wise Man, <HI>I will speak of</HI> E<HI>xcellent Things;</HI> and it is in <HI>excellent strains,</HI> too, that he would speak. It is an observable Antithesis, in <HI>Prov.</HI> 10. 20. <HI>The Tongue of the Just is as choice silver; but the heart of the wicked is little worth.</HI> Thus, here; inasmuch as a
<PB N="16" REF="000623_0022_0FA95EE4902A13A8">
good man has an E<HI>xcellent</HI> S<HI>pirit,</HI> or an <HI>heart of some worth within him,</HI> the Tongue or Speech of such a man, will deserve a <HI>price,</HI> beyond that of the finest <HI>silver,</HI> to be set upon it; yea, the Name of <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> or, a <HI>Golden Mouth'd</HI> Person, belongs unto him. A good man would speak <HI>Honestly,</HI> whenever he speaks. It may be said of him, <HI>He puts away Lying, and</HI> S<HI>peaketh the TRUTH with his NEIGHBOUR.</HI> He is for a perfect Harmony both between <HI>Words and Things</HI> and between T<HI>houghts</HI> and <HI>Words.</HI> Perhaps he do's not speak <HI>all</HI> he Thinks, yet he would ever speak <HI>as</HI> he Thinks. A Good Man would speak <HI>Usefully</HI> too, when ever he speaks. It may be said of him, <HI>No rotten communication proceeds out of his mouth, but such as is good for the use of e|difying.</HI> He is not for such discourse, as may infect the manners of the Hearers; but he is for discoursing, partly on matters of <HI>Perso|nal Business,</HI> and partly on subjects of <HI>General Concernment;</HI> as on the <HI>Truths</HI> of God; or on his <HI>Works,</HI> both in <HI>Creation</HI> and in <HI>Provi|dence.</HI> Once more, A Good Man would also speak <HI>Solidly,</HI> when ever he speaks. He will not foam out his own <HI>Wrath;</HI> nor fly out like a <HI>Nabal,</HI> with reviling language; nor, if they vex him, will he bawl, and fume, like <HI>Saul,</HI> who in his fury, would call
<PB N="17" REF="000623_0023_0FA95EE64583BE40">
his own Son, <HI>The Son of a Whore.</HI> Hee will not sound out his own <HI>Praise</HI> neither; nor will he bragg of what has Enriched him, or Enobled him; no if he must mention any thing that might set off himself, He covers it with such a style as <HI>John</HI> used of old, <HI>There was a Certain Disciple.</HI> Much less will he utter any <HI>Filthiness</HI> whatsoever. All Baw|dy and Obscene talk, is Banished from his lips; nor will he let the Loathesome Steam and Stench of an <HI>Open Sepulchre</HI> come thro' his Throat, by his descanting upon those things, whereof the Apostle saies, <HI>Tis a shame to speak of them.</HI> Finally, A Good Man would speak <HI>Deliberately,</HI> when ever he speaks. He would neither speak <HI>Too soon;</HI> because words can't bee E<HI>aten.</HI> And he considers, <HI>The heart of the Righteous studies to answer; But the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.</HI> Nor would he speak <HI>Too much;</HI> because when the Chest is always o|pen, tis taken for granted, there is little that's valuable there. And he considers, <HI>In the multitude of words, there wants not sin.</HI> What shall I say more; A Good Man would speak so, as becomes one that remembred, what the Scripture saies, <HI>The Lord hearkened and heard!</HI> It is reported by <HI>Tertullian,</HI> that the Feasts among the Faithful in the <HI>P</HI>rimitive Times, were seasoned with very Savoury
<PB N="18" REF="000623_0024_0FA95EE6F12D5330">
Communications; and he gives this as the cause of it; <HI>Ita fabulantur, ut qui sciant Dominum andire.</HI> Thus let a good man be where he will; suppose at the table, yea, or in the <HI>Tavern,</HI> he would speak, what he would be willing to find in the <HI>Book of Gods Remem|branee.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> If a man could get his <HI>Natural Hu|mour</HI> to be S<HI>anctify'd,</HI> there would be an E<HI>xcellent</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI> in him; and this is an Hap|piness which a good man would be very ambitious of. It was the Blessing, in I Thes. 5. 23. <HI>May your whole spirit and soul and body, be preserved Blameless.</HI> There are who judge, that by S<HI>pirit,</HI> here, is meant our <HI>Humour</HI> or our <HI>Temper,</HI> which is that <HI>Air</HI> of our Complexion that results from some circumstances of the <HI>Union</HI> between our S<HI>oul,</HI> and our <HI>Body.</HI> If a man be of a Generous, Affable, Candid <HI>Humour,</HI> we say, <HI>He is a man of such a</HI> S<HI>pirit;</HI> and it were indeed that E<HI>xcellent</HI> S<HI>pirit,</HI> which a good man would fain work himself unto. Every man, is born with some S<HI>pirit,</HI> which we call the <HI>Genius</HI> of the man; and a good man would gladly have his <HI>Humour,</HI> his <HI>Temper,</HI> his <HI>Genius,</HI> cured of all that may be distastful in it. He would therefore <HI>Learn,</HI> what his own <HI>humour</HI> is, which in|deed is not very commonly or <HI>easily
<PB N="19" REF="000623_0025_0FA95EE79EE0A5D8">
Learn't.</HI> We shall not be many <HI>Weeks,</HI> with scarce any man alive, but we shall give a shrow'd guess, <HI>What humour be is of?</HI> Whereas we are many <HI>Years</HI> before we take an exact view of our own. But I say, A good man, would be throughly acquainted with his own <HI>humour;</HI> and then, he would both <HI>Limit</HI> it, and <HI>Apply</HI> it so, as that it may serve him like S<HI>ails</HI> to a Ship, or like <HI>Wings</HI> to a Bird, in the Glorifying of God. One good man, is like <HI>Abraham,</HI> of a free, noble, spending H<HI>umour.</HI> He would now take advantage from this, to supply and nourish the Dis|tressed Members of the Lord Jesus. Ano|ther good man, is like S<HI>ampson,</HI> of a merry, chearful, pleasant <HI>Humour.</HI> From this would he take advantage to be much in Thanks|givings unto God, and in the Joy of the Lord. Here you shall see a good man like E<HI>lijah,</HI> of a Cholerick <HI>Humour.</HI> Now from thence he would take occasion to tes|tify against the Sins of the place, with more warmth and zeal, than is in other men. There you shall see a good man, like <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> of a Melancholly <HI>Humour.</HI> Now he'l turn this, into the channel of Mourning over his own Sins, and the Suf|ferings of his Neighbours. A good man is sometimes like <HI>Peter,</HI> of a Forward <HI>Humour.</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="000623_0026_0FA95EE86190A6C0">
From hence he'l be ready to undertake any Testimony that must be born for the truths and ways of God. Sometimes a Good Man is like <HI>John,</HI> of a very loving <HI>Humour.</HI> Then hee'l set himself to Enkindle Charity, and Extinguish all Contention, in those that are about him. One while, a Good Man, is like <HI>Moses,</HI> of a more Composed <HI>Humour.</HI> And then he will keep up an even walk with God, Let the winds blow from what Point of the Compass they will upon him. O|therwiles, a Good Man is like <HI>Heman,</HI> of a Suspicious <HI>Humour.</HI> And then he will ever suspect lest a Lying Divel, or a False-Heart, be putting some Cheat upon him. Perhaps the Good Man is like <HI>David,</HI> of a Courage|ous <HI>Humour.</HI> He will then be, <HI>Valiant for the Truth upon Earth.</HI> Or perhaps he is like <HI>Barak,</HI> of a Cowardly <HI>Humour.</HI> He will then by <HI>Fear of Death</HI> be driven to the utmost preparation for it. I was going to touch upon a <HI>Revengeful</HI> Humour, and a <HI>Penurious</HI> Humour; but, I may inform the people of such Humours, that I can't re|member any Good Man in all the Bible, of them. So that I only add,&mdash;A Good Man would reduce his Humour to, <HI>The law of Christ,</HI> and then hee'l be of an <HI>Excellent Spi|rit.</HI> A Man will be most <HI>Excellent</HI> that way that his own <HI>Spirit,</HI> or <HI>Humour</HI> goes.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="21" REF="000623_0027_0FA95EEC8989B238">
<HI>VI.</HI> An Intimate <HI>communion</HI> with the <HI>unseen &amp; future world,</HI> would make an <HI>excellent-spirit,</HI> and a good man would pursue that com|munion. It was confess'd concerning <HI>Daniel</HI> in <HI>Dan.</HI> 5.12. <HI>An</HI> E<HI>xcellent</HI> S<HI>pirit was found in him.</HI> And, I pray, what was the Spirit of a <HI>Daniel?</HI> why, it was a Spirit so <HI>Refined</HI> by <HI>Mortification</HI> of all Sensual inclinations, and by assiduous, <HI>Meditations</HI> on Scripture, and <HI>Supplications</HI> to Heaven, that the <HI>Spiritual World</HI> became very familiar with him. I say then, A Good Man would have his own <HI>Spirit</HI> wound up unto an <HI>Unison,</HI> with that part of the <HI>Spiritual World,</HI> which now dwells in God. There is a blessed <HI>World of Spirits</HI> at this day, in the Celestial Regions; but a Good Man thinks with himself. <HI>O! what are they now a doing in the Spiritual World! How are they Dis|pos'd, How are they Employ'd, in that Excellent World!</HI> And as far as this present, Sinful, Dying State will allow of it, he accordingly conforms himself thereunto. He therefore would be most exquisitely Purify'd from the Feculencies of <HI>Pride, Malice, Envy, Selfishness, Uncleanness,</HI> and all that may be offensive to the Holy Spirit of God; and He comes hence to be of so fine a S<HI>pirit,</HI> that he ha's now &amp; then those <HI>Touches</HI> upon him, whereof I may say,<HI>They are unutterable things;</HI> &amp; a Stranger cannot intermeddle in them. Such an <HI>exalt|ed</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="000623_0028_0FA95EED99EADB70">
Spirit, is an E<HI>xcellent</HI> Spirit. But there was one thing in the Spirit of <HI>Daniel,</HI> which calls for a little further Illustration with us. An Angel said unto him, in Dan.9 23. <HI>Thou art greatly Beloved.</HI> It seems, the Angel counted him one of an E<HI>xcellent Spirit.</HI> But it may be rendred, <HI>Thou art a man of Desires;</HI> which a very great Interpreter, says, 'tis to be taken <HI>Actively.</HI> He was a man that had many D<HI>esires</HI> in his Holy Soul, after the <HI>Messiah,</HI> after the <HI>Coming</HI> of the Messiah, and after the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of his Coming. He consulted the Sacred <HI>Prophecies</HI> very much, with <HI>Desires</HI> to understand wherea|bouts the <HI>Church</HI> of God was in the <HI>Line</HI> of Time; and by much <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fast|ing,</HI> he prepared himself accordingly. Here was a thing that rendred him, <HI>A man of Desires,</HI> among the very Angels of God. Thus, if a man would soberly <HI>Bend</HI> himself (which the Apostle tells us, the very <HI>Angels</HI> themselves <HI>Desire</HI> to do!) to <HI>Look</HI> into the <HI>Characters</HI> and <HI>Approaches</HI> of the Coming of our Lord; and instead of any Unscrip|tural and Ill Computed Conclusions about the precise <HI>Time</HI> of it, if the man would now vigorously prosecute such <HI>Frames</HI> and such <HI>Works,</HI> as we should wish our Lord at His Coming would find us in; it would make the man to be of an <HI>Excellent Spirit.</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="000623_0029_0FA95EEE59140758">
There is a wonderful <HI>Charm,</HI> in modest, humble, well-regulated Studies upon the K<HI>ingdom</HI> of our Lord, which is to <HI>Come,</HI> When <HI>His Will shall be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven;</HI> they give a man a certain pre|libation of the <HI>Glory</HI> that shall be in that Kingdom; and they <HI>Transfigure</HI> him till he become, <HI>An Excellent Man.</HI> A little before the <HI>First</HI> Coming of our Lord, there were some that like <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Anna,</HI> had cast up <HI>Daniels</HI> weeks, and finding that they could not be far from the Time of our Lords Coming, they were daily fitting themselves for the Appearance of the <HI>Consolation of Is|rael.</HI> Now these were the <HI>Excellent Spirits</HI> of those Dayes; and the like Dispositions now, towards the <HI>Second</HI> Coming of our Lord, would render men the E<HI>xcellent</HI> Ones of ours. When <HI>Ezekiel</HI> had in a Vision once accurately Look'd upon, <HI>The Son of Man,</HI> from that very Time, the Name of, <HI>Son of</HI> M<HI>an,</HI> came to be put upon himself. This I say, Let us be duly concerned about the Coming of the <HI>Son of Man,</HI> and that <HI>Son of Man,</HI> will gloriously impart unto us, of His own <HI>Excellent Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> The man who Reckons his own <HI>Soul,</HI> an <HI>Excellent Being,</HI> is like to have an <HI>Excellent Spirit;</HI> and a Good Man, will
<PB N="24" REF="000623_0030_0FA95EEF1A857590">
make such a Reckoning. Of a wicked man, 'tis said in Prov. 15. 32. <HI>He despises his own Soul.</HI> But a good man, altho' he do with much <HI>Abasement</HI> of <HI>Soul,</HI> bewayl that <HI>Abasement</HI> of <HI>Soul,</HI> which by Sin, is come upon him; yet he counts his own Soul to be a most <HI>Excellent Being.</HI> When he weighs the State of his Never-dying Soul, it weighs down the whole world be|sides, in his Resentments of it. A Great King was once advised every day, to think on that Word of the Lord Jesus, in Matth. 16. 26. <HI>What is a man profited, if he Gain the whole World, and Loose his own Soul? or, what shall be give in</HI> E<HI>xchange for his Soul?</HI> Why, a good man has that word ever now and then sounding in his Ears, <HI>Ten worlds are not so much worth, as that Soul of thine!</HI> Those two words, A CHRIST and, A SOUL, make a mighty Noise in the Ears of such a man. He looks upon his own Soul, and then he thinks, <HI>This poor Soul, or, such a Soul as this, the whole inferiour World, cannot show an Abler or Nobler Thing?</HI> He again looks upon his own Soul, and thinks. <HI>The Almighty Son of God Himself, counted not his own Blood, a price too big, to lay down for the Ransome of such a Soul?</HI> He looks once more upon his own Soul, and thinks, <HI>The best Angel in Heaven, would gladly be a Guar|dian
<PB N="25" REF="000623_0031_0FA95EEFD97F2538">
to assist the Deliverances of such a Soul!</HI> He goes on to look upon his own Soul, &amp; think, <HI>Here is a Soul, as poor as it is, every cor|ner of Heaven would ring with Joy, at the Conversion of such a Soul. It is a Soul made for Eternity; the bright Mansions of heaven, were built on purpose, for such a Soul to be for ever in them.</HI> And when a good man thus thinks on the <HI>Excellency</HI> of his own Soul, oh! how loth is he to sell that <HI>Soul,</HI> for a <HI>Song! I</HI>ndeed, ungodly men do make most woful <HI>Bargains</HI> about their Souls; insomuch that their Souls may complain, as did the Saviour of Souls, in Zech. 11. 13. <HI>A goodly Price was I valued at of them!</HI> If the Devil tender them a little bit of Money, or Fro|lick, they'l sell their <HI>Souls</HI> unto him, by <HI>Re|bellions like the Sin of Witchcraft.</HI> Whereas, if the Devil offer unto a good man, all the <HI>Pleasures</HI> and <HI>Profits</HI> and <HI>Honours</HI> of the World, he will not sin for the sake thereof, and <HI>wrong his own Soul.</HI> No, he says to the Devil, <HI>Thy offers perish with thee; my Soul is too excellent a thing for thee to have it so.</HI> But instead hereof, a good man thinks no pains, no prayers, no cares too much for the <HI>Sal|vation</HI> of his own Soul. Indeed <HI>Judas</HI> be|grutch'd what was Religiously Expended; saying in Mat.26.8. <HI>To what purpose is this wast?</HI> But when a good man reflects upon all the
<PB N="26" REF="000623_0032_0FA95EF08DB2CA48">
<HI>Self-denial,</HI> and all the <HI>Diligence,</HI> and all the Exercises of <HI>Piery</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> which are for the health of a Soul; he do's not say, <HI>To what purpose is this wast?</HI> No, he owns, <HI>An Excellent Soul, is worth all that can be done for it.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. There is a reading of my Text, which is to this purpose, <HI>A man of Under|standing is of a Cool Spirit;</HI> and indeed a <HI>Cool Spirit,</HI> is an <HI>Excellent Spirit.</HI> So then, a Good Man would have a <HI>Spirit</HI> free from those <HI>Heats,</HI> which may distemper it. Particularly, A Good Man would have a <HI>Cool Spirit</HI> un|der <HI>Afflictions</HI> from the hand of God. He would have no Rage of <HI>Spirit,</HI> at any of those Losses, or Crosses, which may befall him; No, there are these two things, which he takes always for Granted. One is that in I Sam. 3 18. <HI>It is the Lord.</HI> Another is that in Gen. 50 20. <HI>God meant it unto Good.</HI> This makes him resolve, <HI>Il take anything well at the hands of my God!</HI> He would with a marvellous <HI>Patience,</HI> of Spirit, bear any of those disasters, that may come upon him, as being perswaded, <HI>That God therein punishes him, far less than his iniquities have deserved;</HI> and <HI>That God chastens him for his profit.</HI> Moreover, A Good Man, would have a <HI>Cool Spirit</HI> under <HI>Injuries</HI> from the hand of Man also. He would mentain a Calm of
<PB N="27" REF="000623_0033_0FA95EF18A0F5528">
<HI>Spirit,</HI> altho' he should be never so much af|fronted and abused; and he would be ready to overlook the most provoking passages. He would follow that pattern, in <HI>I Pet.</HI> 2.21. <HI>Christ, who when he was Reviled, Reviled not again, when He suffered, He Threatned not.</HI> He would obey that precept in <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 17, 19. <HI>Recompence no man evil for evil; Avenge not your selves, but rather give place to wrath.</HI> He would have such a <HI>Spirit</HI> as there was in <HI>Moses; Moses</HI> was Pastor and Leader of a great congregation, wherein some or other were almost every day basely murmuring at him; yet was he always <HI>Preaching</HI> to them, <HI>Praying</HI> for them, and Standing in their <HI>Gap;</HI> with small or no Regret at their unwor|thiness. He would have such a <HI>Spirit,</HI> as there was in <HI>Calvin; Calvin</HI> had bin by <HI>Luther</HI> un|handsomely Reflected on; But, <HI>Well,</HI> said this Brave man, <HI>Though</HI> Luther <HI>should call me a Devil, yet I will call him an Eminent Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> What a Spirit was that Expressed by Famous Mr. <HI>Dod?</HI> A furious Blade being Enraged at his faithful Ministry, barbarously gave him a Blow, that struck Two of his Teeth out. He spat out his Teeth with his Blood, into his Hand; and only said, <HI>Here, you have knock'd out a Couple of my Teeth without any cause; but on condition I might help forward
<PB N="28" REF="000623_0034_0FA95EF32A06AAC0">
the Salvation of your Soul, I would permit you to dash out all the rest.</HI> A Good man would gladly be of such a Spirit; and have that, <HI>Meek and Quiet Spirit,</HI> whereof the Apostle tells us, <HI>In the sight of God, it is of great price.</HI> Be sure, The <HI>Spirit</HI> that is <HI>Contentious,</HI> is not <HI>Excellent,</HI> albeit, <HI>only by Pride</HI> (which is an affectation of <HI>Excellence) comes Contention. Fire</HI> will soonest Catch in the roofs of Thatch't, Low-built, Little Cottages. The Highest Regions are sedate; there are no storms to ruffle them. <HI>Excellent Spirits,</HI> like the Angels, are willing to go <HI>Down</HI> as well as <HI>Up,</HI> the Ladder of Heaven; and they will not Justle one another. This is an <HI>Excellent Spirit;</HI> I appeal to every <HI>Conscience,</HI> whether it be not so. But, in Gods Name, can you stand before the <HI>Glass?</HI> who of us can find such a <HI>Spirit</HI> in our selves? I have only this further to say upon it. As they said, in Judg.18 9. <HI>Arise, for we have seen the Land; behold, it is very Good; and are ye still? Be not slothful to go and Inter and pos|sess the Land.</HI> So <HI>I</HI> say, Arise, you have seen the Linea|ments of a <HI>Spirit;</HI> behold, it is an <HI>Excellent Spirit;</HI> and are ye still? <HI>Be not slothful;</HI> but use all sit means for the obtaining of such a Spirit. If you ask, <HI>What shall are do?</HI> I only Leave this one Lesson with you. <HI>Cry mightily for the Spirit of God.</HI> It was said of <HI>Barnabas</HI> He was <HI>ful of the Holy Ghost;</HI> and it is further noted, He was a <HI>good man;</HI> or one of <HI>an excellent Spirit.</HI> O <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> what you can then, that you may be <HI>ful of the Holy Ghost;</HI> you will not be without an <HI>Excellent Spirit,</HI> if you have in you the <HI>Spirit of the Holy God;</HI> that Spirit is an <HI>excellent</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and <HI>excellent</HI> are all the <HI>Fruits</HI> of that Spirit.

<P><HI>THere is now to be</HI> Seen <HI>by you, a Sermon which was</HI> Heard, <HI>at a Time whereof the Inhabitants of this Province may say, as the Romans once did upon another Occasion,</HI> They had not seen a Greater Day. <HI>But if upon this Little Sermon, as upon another</HI> Pharez, <HI>it should be demanded,</HI> How hast thou broken forth? <HI>it must be answered, That the further Publication of this Discourse, is the effect of the</HI> Desires, <HI>&amp;</HI> Com|mands, <HI>which your House have given</HI> me. <HI>And I would indeed-with an Abased Soul, adore the Free|Grace of God, that any thing of</HI> mine, <HI>should be ei|ther Serviceable or Acceptable to his Dear People; without being Discouraged by the</HI> Frequency <HI>of my being driven thus unto published Labours; inasmuch as 'tis promised among the Blessings of Heaven,</HI> The <HI>L</HI>ord thy God, will make thee plenteous in every Work of thy Hand: <HI>but I would also speak as did the Venerable</HI> Baxter, <HI>when some Comforted him in his Dying Hours with the Remembrance of what Good had been done, by his Preaching and Writing for the Church of God,</HI> Alas, I was but a Pen in <HI>G</HI>ods Hand; and what praise can be due to a Pen?</P>
<P><HI>As for the Meditations now put into your Hands, I have only this Favour to beg of my Country, That they would not imagine me to undertake the</HI> Theme, <HI>of a</HI> Comparison <HI>between the priviledges which we</HI> had <HI>in our</HI> former, <HI>and the priviledges which we</HI>

have <HI>in our present Settlements;</HI> That <HI>is a Subject forreign to the province of a Preacher; and perhaps many of those which handle it,</HI> Enquire not wisely of this matter. <HI>Only thus much I profess to Design;</HI> I <HI>would fain have all this people sensible, That God has most Graciously inclined their Majesties to do those things for us, which lay us under greater Obli|gations of Gratitude, both to</HI> Him <HI>and</HI> Them, <HI>than any other of the English Dominions.

<HEAD>Good Things Propounded in a Sermon, TO The GOVERNOUR and General Court, of the Massachusetts-Bay NEW-ENGLAND. June 9. 1692.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>II Chron. XII. XII.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Also in</HI> Judah <HI>Things went well.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT ha's been sometimes Remark'd, That the <HI>Bible</HI> is unto the <HI>Church,</HI> what the <HI>Firmament</HI> is unto the <HI>World;</HI> the God of Heaven ha's Gloriously <HI>Ex|panded</HI> these Heavenly Oracles over us, and in this <HI>Expanse</HI> we have those things that are, <HI>To give light upon the earth.</HI> The Steers-Men, of this poor shattered, sinking <HI>Bark,</HI> are in a <HI>General Assembly</HI> this day Convened and there is a Bright Star in the <HI>Firmament</HI> of the <HI>Bible,</HI> which I would humbly recom|mend unto their <HI>Observation:</HI> Tis the Text now read unto us, whereof I may with good Reason say, <HI>Yee shall do well if ye take heed thereunto, as unto a light that shines in a dark place.</HI> Nor is it unworthy to be <HI>CONSYDERED</HI> with a particular Attention by our selves in such a <HI>DarkTime</HI> as has been upon us. There is,

<HI>Prophecy,</HI> as well as <HI>History,</HI> in those Records, which the Scriptures give us of Transacti|ons that happened between Two and Three Thousand years agoe; they Foretel what <HI>Effects</HI> will still follow upon what <HI>Causes;</HI> being written for the <HI>Admonition,</HI> even of <HI>Us upon whom the ends of the World are come.</HI> It is no less the Sollicitous <HI>Enquiry</HI> of <HI>all</HI> men.

Now to be satisfy'd about that matter, I invite you to Look upon a passage that happened <HI>so Long ago; Also in</HI> Judah, <HI>things went well.</HI></P>
<P>In our Context, We find that the People of God, had been Labouring under <HI>Oppres|sions</HI> and <HI>Confusions,</HI> which rendred them very miserable; they had cast off the <HI>Ser|vice</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and for this they were punish|ed with a <HI>Slavery</HI> to <HI>men;</HI> a Cruel <HI>Shishak</HI> had got them under the Yokes of his Arbi|trary Government. The merciful God was pleased, at length, to <HI>Recover</HI> them out of the miseries with which they had been harassed; and <HI>Establish</HI> them with Settle|ments not altogether unlike those which they had formerly enjoy'd; in which hap|py Restoration, that Eminent Man of God, the Prophet <HI>Shemajah,</HI> was more than ordi|narily Instrumental.</P>

My Text in general Terms, does give us an Account of the Circumstances which attended the Restoration of the Jews out of their Calamities. There was first, a Seri|ous <HI>Humiliation,</HI> on mans part; there was then a Gracious, <HI>Reconciliation</HI> on Gods part; and upon this it follows, <HI>Things went well;</HI> or as it may be rendred, <HI>There were good Things among them.</HI> As there were the <HI>Good Things,</HI> which produced <HI>Good Terms</HI> between God and Them; the <HI>Good Things</HI> of Repentance, of Obedience, of Reformation; so there were the <HI>Good Things</HI> which were the effects of such <HI>Good Terms</HI> as those; namely, the <HI>Good Things,</HI> of Prosperity. <HI>Good Times</HI> are imply'd in the <HI>Good Things,</HI> that were now among the peo|ple of God. <HI>Things went well;</HI> the meaning is, They had not Needy, Hungry, Bloody, <HI>Strangers</HI> any more to Lord it over them; There were no <HI>Shishaks</HI> to squeez hard Quitrents from them for what they had before possess'd as their <HI>Free-holds</HI> Time out of mind; As to their <HI>Sacred</HI> Concerns, there was none to give them Disturbance in the <HI>Worship</HI> of God; As to their <HI>Civil</HI> Con|cerns, there was now no <HI>Law,</HI> and no <HI>Tax,</HI> imposed upon them, except what their own Acts concurr'd unto. <HI>Things went well,</HI> when the <HI>Times</HI> grew both <HI>Morally,</HI> and <HI>Peaceably</HI> Better than they were before.</P>

The Text thus paraphrased, will cast into our Hands, a very important CASE; <HI>When do Things Go Well among a People?</HI></P>
<P>Or, What are those <HI>Good Things,</HI> which would make <HI>Any,</HI> and, if you please, OUR SELVES, Particularly, an Hap|py People?</P>
<P>In the Handling of this Case, there is,</P>
<P>FIRST, One General Assertion, which we may advance, as Preliminary to our more Particular Thoughts, that are to fol|low. 'Tis This;</P>
<P><HI>Good Men</HI> are <HI>Good Things</HI> among any People; and Things will <HI>go well</HI> with a People, when <HI>Good Men</HI> abound among them. <HI>Good Men</HI> have much of God with them; 'tis to <HI>Them,</HI> that the God of Heaven says, <HI>I am with thee;</HI> so that if we have ma|ny such <HI>Men of God</HI> among us, the <HI>God of those men,</HI> will therein vouchsafe His own Presence unto us; now, the presence of God carryes all sorts of Blessings with it. He says, <HI>Wo to them, if I depart from them;</HI> and we may say, <HI>It will be well with us, if God be with us;</HI> now, God our <HI>Father,</HI> will be where many of His <HI>Children</HI> are. It was said concerning a Sinful Nation, in Isai.6.13.

<HI>The Holy seed, shall be the substance thereof;</HI> that is, the S<HI>tock</HI> or T<HI>runk</HI> of it. As the strength of a tree, is in the stock or trunk of it; so the <HI>strength</HI> of a people do's ly in a Number of <HI>Holy</HI> men among them; <HI>Holy Men,</HI> that have wholly Dedicated themselves unto the Service and Glory of God: <HI>Holy men</HI> that are afraid of defiling themselves with any Breaches of piety, or charity in their conver|sation: <HI>Holy men,</HI> to whom the character of <HI>Barnabas</HI> belongs, T<HI>hey are good men and full of faith and full of the Holy Ghost;</HI> of such men I may say, T<HI>hey are the chariots of a people,</HI> &amp; <HI>the Horsemen thereof,</HI> we should be well-guarded, if there were good store of such good men among us. <HI>Good men</HI> are <HI>Gap-men,</HI> to keep off the Judgments of Heaven, from the people, which they belong unto. It is recorded of a good <HI>Moses,</HI> in <HI>Psal.</HI> 106. 23. <HI>He stood be|fore the Lord, in the Breach, to turn away His wrath, Lest he should destroy them.

Secondly.

Now to the making of such as deserve to be called MEN, 'tis well known that Learn|ed S<HI>chools</HI> are altogether Necessary! And hence, among the people of God, even when Immediate and Extraordinary <HI>Inspi|rations,</HI> were more granted than in our Dayes, yet <HI>Schools of the Prophets,</HI> were in request; and the Great <HI>Samuel</HI> himself was President of a <HI>Colledge.</HI> The Jews tell us, that the <HI>Hill pertaining to Phinehas,</HI> whereof there is mention in the last Words of <HI>Jo|shua's</HI> History, had a <HI>Colledge</HI> upon it, which <HI>Phinehas</HI> himself, was the Rector of. Thus when we read in I Sam. 10. 5. About, <HI>The Hill of God, where was a Station of the Phi|listines;</HI> the Jews inform us, there was a Colledge of young Prophets upon that Hill; which the Barbarous <HI>Philistines</HI> them|selves, did not care to Demolish, because of the <HI>Divine Studies,</HI> which were followed in that Academy.

This was the practice of the pious <HI>Hebrews;</HI> and I might add, that the profane <HI>Pagans</HI> themselves had so much Discretion too, as to see, that S<HI>chools</HI> were needful to make Things <HI>Go well</HI> among them. It would insinuate some undue Suspicion of you, if I should enlarge on this point; but, how importunately is it now to be desired, That the like S<HI>chools</HI> may be supported among our selves!

What is the first cause, why things do not <HI>go well</HI> in our dayes? Tis intimated in 2 Tim. 3. 1. 2. <HI>In the Last days perillous times shall come:</HI> Why so? First, <HI>Because men shall be lovers of their own</HI> S<HI>elves.</HI> That is, men shall so <HI>Love Themselves,</HI> as to love no body else. But when there is a plentiful sett of men, that are sincerely de|sirous to <HI>Know</HI> what they may D<HI>o,</HI> and to <HI>Do</HI> what they shall <HI>Know,</HI> for the service of the Publick; Such men will do much to make things <HI>go well</HI> where they come. They that have a single Eye at, <HI>The good of many,</HI> in such things as they propose and pursue; They with whom the old Heathenish ver|tue, <HI>Pietas in Patriam,</HI> is become a Christian Grace; and they whose chief Mark is not, T<HI>hey seek their own things,</HI> will cause Things to <HI>go well</HI> indeed!

But this I know, That the way for a people to escape falling in that Horrendous <HI>Earthquake,</HI> which is now be|gun upon the Nations, is to obtain the fa|vour of, CHRIST WITH US; <HI>Then</HI> may we sing, <HI>We will not fear, tho the earth be removed and the mountains be carried into the midst of the Sea.</HI> And this I know; That the way for us to have, CHRIST WITH US, in this Overturning <HI>Earthquake,</HI> is to have and own as much as we can, the Ordinances of an Evangelical <HI>Church-State</HI> among us; <HI>Those</HI> Evangelical Things are the <HI>Things that cannot be shaken.</HI></P>

Those Churches of <HI>Piedmont</HI> which are, as it were the <HI>Root</HI> of all the Protestant Chur|ches being thus <HI>Revived,</HI> it marvellously Confirms the conjecture, so often published among you, That the last Persecution be|ing over, we are got into those Dreadful E<HI>arthquakes,</HI> with which the <HI>Resurrection of our Lords Witnesses,</HI> is to be accompanyed.
