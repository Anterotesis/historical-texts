My designe at present is only to Commend a few things to the</HI> serious and Christian Consideration <HI>of the</HI> Antisynodalian Brethren. <HI>Brethren</HI> I <HI>was once of your perswasion, and thence can with the more</HI> Love and Compassion <HI>speak unto you. What the Arguments were which caused me to be of</HI> another mind, <HI>is not here a place to relate, but it shall be done</HI> (if God permit) <HI>elsewhere. For the present, let it su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fice to be said, that</HI> Study and Prayer, and much Affliction <HI>hath brought me to be of</HI> another be|lief, <HI>then once I was of touching the</HI> Controverted Questions. <HI>And unto you that are still of the</HI> Antisynodalian perswasion, <HI>I would in the</HI> bowels and love of Christ <HI>say these few things.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Consider that it is possible that you may be mistaken in your Apprehensions. <HI>Many things might be mentioned to you, which ought to Cause an</HI> humble jealousy <HI>in you, least so it should be.

<Q>There is a notable Expression of <HI>Basil</HI> cited in an Epi|stle of <HI>Luther</HI> to the Ministers of <HI>Nor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mberg,</HI> who were at vari|variance

Thus, He.</P>

For the most part, when</HI> godly learned men miss of the Truth, <HI>it is in points which eith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r they have not at all, or not</HI> throughly <HI>and</HI> Impartially <HI>studied, when as the</HI> Leaders <HI>in the</HI> Synod mentioned, <HI>had most</HI> industriously, <HI>and not without</HI> prayers <HI>and</HI> Tears <HI>laboured to know the will of the Lord, con|ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ning these Affairs of his</HI> house, <HI>and</HI> Kingdome. <HI>Nor is it to be fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gotten,</HI> how the Lord did in his Providence signally own that As|sembly. <HI>For at the Time of their</HI> second Sessions <HI>there was a</HI> sore <HI>and</HI> threatning d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ought <HI>on the Land, whereupon that</HI> Synod <HI>set a day apart to seek the Lord by</HI> Fasting <HI>and</HI> Prayer, <HI>and</HI> Immediately <HI>upon those Prayers did</HI> the Lord give Rain from Heaven, <HI>whereby he did from Heaven own both hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Servants, and the work which they were about. And therein likewise we may observe a</HI> divine Confutation <HI>of those Spirits, who impute our</HI> droughts, blastings, <HI>&amp;c. to that</HI> Assembly, <HI>or to the</HI> Doctrine <HI>by them asserted and propugned. Remember also that there have been very</HI> worthy men (<HI>amongst whom I who am Con|scious to my self, that I am</HI> the chief of Sinners, <HI>am no way worthy to be mentioned) who were against such</HI> Inlargement of Baptisme <HI>as the</HI> Sy|nod <HI>pleads for, yet upon</HI> second and wisest thoughts (<GAP DESC="foreign">) <HI>have seen Cause to change their opinion. This is true concerning some now at</HI> rest with Christ, <HI>and sundry</HI> (amongst whom as I said I reckon not my self) yet surviving. <HI>Yea, it is true concerning some</HI> Judicious <HI>of the</HI> Congregational way <HI>in</HI> England <HI>as well as in</HI> New-England. <HI>It is a good Observation which I remember</HI> Mr. <HI>Cotton hath in his Letter to</HI> Mr. <HI>Williams.

<Q>should (<HI>say they</HI>) the Church education of your Children be by the want of your hearty Concurrence rendred either infeasable or ineffectual, should they live as Lambs in a large Pasture for want of your Agreement to own them of the Flock; we beseech you Consider how uncomfortable the Accompt hereof will be another day.</Q>
<HI>Truly when I think, (and I often think of it)</HI> seriously and sadly with my self, <HI>that in a Plantation of Religion (for such</HI> New-England <HI>was) the Generality of the Inhabitants should be in the Condition of</HI> Infidels, <HI>that the</HI> Posterity of a People professing God|liness, yea, of the most eminent Professors in the whole World, should in our Age be as <HI>Infidels</HI> even not so much as within the <HI>Compass</HI> of the <HI>visible Church,</HI> or have <HI>the Livery and Character belonging to Chri|stians upon them,</HI> whereby such are distinguished from the <HI>Infidel and Pagan World,</HI> what it ha's to others I know not, but to me it ha's a <HI>most formidable appearance,</HI> Remember also that the light ha's been forth, in which respect, <HI>Now for you to oppose the Truth, after that</HI> Convincing Testimonies <HI>have been given to it by the</HI> Lords Servants, <HI>will be farr more dangerous and provoking to the Lord, then in former Times amongst us,</HI> when these things had not been so fully enquired into, as of late <HI>through the good hand of Divine Providence</HI> it ha's been. <HI>A third word which I would say is, study well the point of In|fant Baptisme. Acquaint your selves with the Scripture proofs for that Ordinance,</HI> I must acknowledge that that ha's been no small Con|firmation to me. <HI>This I find that there is hardly an Argument produ|ced against such Inlargement, as is by the Synod asserted, but what the</HI> Antipaedo-Baptists <HI>make use of to serve their turn.</HI> Also that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Arguments which do demonstrate <HI>Paedo-Baptisme in general,</HI> do (for the most part) prove that Baptisme ought to be Administred in the <HI>Latitude</HI> which the <HI>Synod</HI> pleads for. <HI>The last word which I shall say is this, use all means of Gods appointing, that you may come to under|stand the Truth in this matter.</HI> There have been some to my know|ledge (and because I know there have been some, I am apt to think there may be many more then I know of) <HI>that have exclaimed much against the</HI> Synod Book, <HI>as if it were an Apostacy and Impurity,</HI> &amp;c. That yet upon Examination have Confessed, that they never read

the Book, much less have they read other things written in <HI>defence</HI> thereof; and how farr then have they been from reading these things, <HI>with Prayers and Tears, and Humiliations before the Lord, oh! if Brethren would prove all things, and pray uncessantly over what they do, and add deep Hum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">liations to their Prayers, and depend upon Christ for light,</HI> we might hope that God would either discover his Truth to them, in the very things they are searching after, or in some other matters better for them to know, and in the mean Time help them to carry it with <HI>that Christian moderation that becometh Saints,</HI> Prov. 23, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 5.

<P>As for the Reasons which have induced me to this <HI>ensuing Collection,</HI> besides those <HI>general motives</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Introduction,</HI> the spe|cial Considerations which haue prevailed with me were, First, that I might please God in <HI>obeying the fifth Commandment by vindicating the honour of my Fathers.</HI> (2 <HI>dly.</HI>) in that a special Advantage ha's been put into my hands for this undertaking, by Reason of my Ac|quaintance with the <HI>Manuscripts</HI> of both my Fathers, (I mean my Father <HI>Cotton,</HI> and my Father <HI>Mather</HI>) from whence these <HI>Testimo|nies</HI> are for the most part produced.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To our Reverend and Beloved Brethren the Elders with the rest of the Church of <HI>Dorchester.</HI> Grace and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Iesus Christ our Saviour.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The Case of Conscience which you propounded to our Conside|ration, [to wit, whether a Grand-Father being a member of a Chri|stian Church, might claim Baptism to his Grand-Child, whose next Parents be not received into Church Covenant] ha's been delibe|rately treated of in our Church Assembled together publickly in the name of Christ. And <HI>upon due and serious discourse about the point, it seemed good unto us all with one accord,</HI> and agreeable (as we believe) to the word of the Lord, that the Grand-Father may lawfully claim that priviledge to his Grand-child in such a Case, yet with these two Cautions. First, that the Grand-child baptiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by right of the Grand-fathers Covenant, be Committed to the Grand fathers edu|cation; for as God in the Covenant of Grace undertaketh to be a God unto the Believer and his seed, so by the Rule of Relatives, the Tenour of the Covenant requireth that the Believer, do undertake that himself and his Seed do give up themselves to become the peo|ple of the Lord, which he canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> undertake, in behalf of his Seed, unless they be committed to his education&punc; 2. This other Caution also we conceive to be requisite, that the Parents of the Child, do
<PB N="3" REF="000208_0010_0FA31646C63EFFC0">
not thereby take oc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">asion to neglect the due and seasonable prepara|tion of themselves for entrance into Covenant with God and his Church: these Cautions premised and observed, the Baptisme of the Grand-child by right of his Grand-fathers Covenant, we believe to be warranted from the nature and tenour of the Covenant of Grace by this Reason, where there is a Stipulation of the Covenant on Gods part, and restipulation of the Covenant on mans part, there may be an obsignation of the Covenant on both parts, or in plainer words, where there is an offer of the Covenant on Gods part, and a receiving and undertaking of the Covenant on mans part, there may be a sealing of it on both parts? But here is an offer of the Covenant on Gods part, <HI>Gen. 17.7.</HI> where God says, that he will be a God to <HI>Abraham,</HI> that is, to the Believer and his Seed, and by Seed is not there meant the next Seed only, but Seeds Seed also to many Generations, <HI>Isai. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">9.21.</HI> And here is likewise a receiving and undertaking of the Covenant on mans part, seeing the Grand-father receiveth the Covenant by his faith, and by the profession of his faith, and by his desire of the Seal of the Covenant to strengthen his faith, and he unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">keth also the keeping of the Covenant, in bringing up his Grand-child as much as in him lies to live and walk as himself does, as one of Gods people, according to the Tenour of the Covenant, from whence the Conclusion evidently followeth, that therefore Baptisme may there be Administred to Seal up the Cove|nant, where the Grand-father receives the Covenant, &amp; undertakes to bring up his Grand-child in the faith and obedience of the Covenant.</P>
<P>Against this Argument it was objected by some what the Apostle writes, <HI>1 Cor. 7.14.</HI> where if both the husband and the wife, who are the next Parents of the Child be unbelieving, the Child is pro|nounced unclean, and therefore uncapable of the holy Covenant, and of the holy Seal of it, whereto it was answered that the word in the Text translated <HI>unbelieving</HI> is in the Original <HI>Infidel.</HI> Now <HI>there is a difference between an Infidel and a Carnal Christian, as then was amongst the Iews a difference between an Heathen and a Carnal Israelite.</HI> Though the Child be unclean where both the Parents are Pagans and Infidels, yet <HI>we may not account such Parents for Pa|gans and Infidels, who are themselves baptized, and profess their belief of the Fundamental Articles of the Christian Faith, and live without notorious Scandalous Crime, though they give not clear evidence of their regenerate estate,</HI> nor are convinced of the necessity of Church Covenant. After this Answer given, there was no farther reply
<PB N="4" REF="000208_0011_0FA3164785A95B28">
against the point in hand, but on the contrary, some of the Brethren expressing their Consents with Addition of other Reasons, and all of them by their silence, <HI>we do therefore profess it to be the judgement of our Church,</HI> and as we believ agreeable to the word of God (such Cautions being observed as hath been mentioned) <HI>that the Grand-Father a member of the Church, may claim the priviledge of Baptisme to his Grand-Child, though his next Seed the Parents of the Child be not received themselves into Church Covenant.</HI> Wherein nevertheless we desire, so to be understood, not as presuming to judge others, who happily may be of different opinion in this point, or to direct you, who are by the grace of God given to you, able to direct your selves and us also in the Lord, but as willing in meekness of wisdome to search out the truth of God with you, and in brotherly Love to satisfy your request and demand touching this Question.</P>
<P>Now the God of truth and peace Lead you into all truth, and go on to build up his holy Kingdome in the midst of you in the graci|ous Administration of all his holy Ordinances amongst you in the Lord Jesus, In whom we rest.</P>

<P>Now this is a great Testimony, for if <HI>Anno 1634.</HI> which was amongst the Primitive Times of these Churches, if then a Grand Fa|ther, such Cautions being observed, as have been mentioned, being a member of a Church might claim the Priviledge of Baptisme to his grand Child, though his next Seed the Immediate Parents of the Child be not received themselves into full Communion, if then also it were true, that there is a difference between an Infidel and a Carnal Christian as then was amongst the Jews, a difference between an Hea|then and a Carnal Israelite, and that we may not account such Parents for Pagans and Infidels, and so not their Children for unclean, who are themselves baptized, and profess their belief of the Fundamental Arti|cles of the Christian Faith, and live without notorious scanda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s crime, though they give not clear Evidence of their Regenerate Estate, if this were true doctrine, <HI>Anno</HI> 1634.

<Q>If the godly members of a Congregation formerly Subject to Episcopacy, repenting of their sinful subordinati|on thereto shall be studious of Reformation, and shall solemnly Cove|nant to endeavour the same, and shall choose their former godly Mi|nisters, into the Pastors &amp; Teachers office, it is not necessary they should take the ignorant or Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al members of the Parish into the fellowship of this renewed Election of their Ministers, and yet it is not impro|bable, but the Ministers may perform some Ministerial acts to them, as not only to preach the word to them, but (happily) also to baptize their Children. For such members are like the Church members, with us baptized in their Infancy, yet not received to the Lords Sup|per, when they come to Age, nor admitted to fellowship of voting in Admissions, Elections, Censures, till they come to profess their faith, and repentance, and lay hold of the Covenant of their Parents before the Church.

<P>Likevise in another Letter, which is extant, under Mr. <HI>Cottons</HI> own hand writing, to one who thus objected, Carnal children are not fit to renew their Covenant, whilst they are unfit to partake in the Seal of the Covenant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He replies in these words,
<Q>Though they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e not fit to make such profession of visible faith, as to admit them to the Lords Table, yet they may make profession full enough to receive them to Baptisme, or to the same esta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e <HI>Ishmael</HI> stood in after Cir|cumcission.</Q></P>
<P>And to one who complained of being in the dark about the truth asserted in Mr. <HI>Cottons</HI> printed Book concerning the Baptisme of In|fants, and that amongst other made this Objection,
<Q>when (said that Scrupler) a child comes to know that his Parents are no visible Saints, but appear to be contrary both in Life and Doctrine, and the children had only words and water poured on them, how came these persons to have right to it, the Parents having no visible faith to act in that Ordinance, and their children likewise being uncapable, to hold forth the acts of faith before men. He thus Answereth, <HI>Iero|boam and his wife were neither of them visibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Saints,</HI> in your Sense, but appeared to be contrary both in <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Doctrine,</HI> yet the <HI>Cir|cumcision</HI> of their <HI>Son</HI> was not in vain to him, <HI>1 Kings 14.13.</HI> In this <HI>Case</HI> when the faith of the Parents is wanting, and yet they still live within the <HI>Pale</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> though the <HI>Church</HI> be <HI>Corrupt,</HI> and the <HI>Parents</HI> also, yet here the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eech</HI> of the <HI>Apostle</HI> takes place, what though some believed not, <HI>shall their unbelief make the faith of God of none effect, God forbid,</HI> Rom. 3.<HI>3,</HI> 4. now the <HI>Faithfulness</HI> of <HI>God</HI> who <HI>keepeth Covenant and mercy to thousands,</HI> supplies the de|fect of the <HI>Faith</HI> of the <HI>next Parents,</HI> and <HI>maketh good his Covenant</HI> to the <HI>Children</HI> in respect of the <HI>Faith</HI> of their <HI>former Ancestors</HI> in <HI>Elder Ages.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But against this some may object a passage in Mr. <HI>Cottons Book of the way of the Churches, pag. 81.</HI> where it is said, <HI>where neither of the Parents can claim right to the Lords Supper, their Infants cannot claim right to Baptisme,</HI> therefore it may seem, that Mr. <HI>Cottons Iudgement</HI> was not as hath been now declared. Unto this, let the <HI>judicious Reader attentively</HI> hear the Answer, which is, (1.) In that very Book of Mr. <HI>Cot|tons,</HI> there are sundry passages which plead for an <HI>Enlargement</HI> of <HI>Bap|Baptisme,</HI>

<P N="2">2 <HI>dly.</HI> That Book of the way was printed from an <HI>imperfect Copy,</HI> in which respect it is not to be wondred at, if there be therein some pas|sages <HI>contradictory</HI> to Mr. <HI>Cottons known Iudgement. (3.)</HI> Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> himself was much troubled when he saw that Book come forth, and was desirous that the Reader should understand that his Judgement i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> such things, wherein the <HI>Book of the way</HI> is <HI>discrepant</HI> from that of the <HI>Keyes,</HI> should be sought for, not in the <HI>Book of the way,</HI> but in that of the <HI>Keys.</HI> And that no one may think that these things are <HI>Imaginary,</HI> or <HI>conjectural</HI> only, let us hear Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> speaking in his own words in his <HI>printed defence</HI> against the <HI>Imputations</HI> of Mr. <HI>Cawdrey</HI> written not long before his death, and Published by <HI>Doctor Owen,</HI> In which Book <HI>pag. 36.37, 38, 39.</HI>
<Q>The truth is (saith Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI>) that ma|ny years ago I was seriously moved by some of our <HI>Brethren</HI> and <HI>Fellow Elders</HI> here to draw up an <HI>Historical narration</HI> of our <HI>Church way,</HI> together with some <HI>familiar Grounds</HI> of the same briefly. In short time as God helped, I dispatched it, which when our <HI>Brethren</HI> had perused it; I saw they did not close with it, yet a <HI>Brother</HI> going fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>England,</HI> got some where, a Copy of it, and presented it to some of the <HI>Congregational way</HI> there, and I afterwards heard, neither did they close with it, and in particular not with that passage which is here recited&mdash; which since appeareth more openly, by the <HI>Aste|risk</HI> put upon that passage, and upon sundry other in the Book, but before I saw that, and had only heard, that they did not fully ac|cord, I hoped that it had met with a <HI>timely Suppression,</HI> rather then an <HI>Impression,</HI> for I heard no more of it, for two or three years after, mean while perceiving that one main point of <HI>dissatisfaction,</HI> was the <HI>Authority</HI> gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n to the <HI>Fraternity,</HI> I consiered more <HI>se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iously</HI> and <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|stinctly</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the whole power of the <HI>Keys,</HI> and expressed my <HI>apprehen|sion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> in that treatise of the <HI>Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> which our <HI>Brethren</HI> here did well ac|cept, and so did the <HI>Brethren</HI> of like Judgement in <HI>England,</HI> and some of them were pleased to attest it, with the <HI>Preface</HI> that is now <HI>Extant</HI> before it&punc;&mdash;This was sundry years after the <HI>Trea|tise</HI> of the <HI>way</HI> had been finished, and carryed to <HI>England,</HI> and as I ho|ped suppressed, but it seemeth some <HI>Brother</HI> there- caused his Copy, which was indeed <HI>abrupt</HI> in the <HI>Entrance,</HI> and imperfect&punc; otherwise

to be published in print, which when I saw, it troubled me not a lit|tle, as knowing that the <HI>discrepant Expressions</HI> in the one, and in the other, might trouble Friends, and give Advantages to Adversaries. I suffered both to stand as they did, especially, seeing I could not help it, the <HI>Book of the way</HI> being published without my Consent, and both the <HI>way</HI> and the <HI>Keys</HI> past my revoking, so that if the Replier find some discrepancy in one of these Books from the other, Let him know that the Doctrine of the <HI>way,</HI> in such few points, wherein it differs from the <HI>Keys,</HI> was not mine, when the <HI>Keys</HI> was publi|shed, much less when the <HI>way</HI> was published, which was many years after, though it had been penned many years before.</Q></P>
<P>Thus much may suffice for the clearing of Mr. <HI>Cottons Iudgement, concerning the Subject of Baptisme.</HI> In the same year, and in the same Vessel, with Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> came into this Country that famous Mr. <HI>Thomas Hooker</HI> late Pastor of the Church in <HI>Hartford</HI> upon <HI>Conne|cticot.</HI> Now that in Mr. <HI>Hookers Iudgement,</HI> the Children concerning whom the Question is, have a continued standing, and membership in the visible Church (upon which hinge the Controversy about the <HI>En|largement</HI> of the <HI>Subject of Baptisme</HI> turns) is evident from a passage in his most Judicious and <HI>accurate Survey of Church Discipline,</HI> in which Book
<Q><HI>pag. 48.</HI> are these words, in some Cases&punc; (saith Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI>) an Implicit Covenant, may be fully Sufficient, as Suppose a whole Congregation should consist of such, who were Children to the Parents now d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceased, who were C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nfederate, their children were true members, according to the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es of the Gospel by pro|fessing of their Fathers Covenant, though they should not make any <HI>personal</HI> and <HI>vocal Expression</HI> of their <HI>Engagement,</HI> as the Fathers did.</Q>
Also he lays it down for a <HI>Maxim</HI> that <HI>faederati sunt baptizandi</HI> pro|ving by several Arguments that Confederates are the <HI>proper Subject</HI> of <HI>Baptisme,</HI> see in the same Book, <HI>pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t 3. pag. 11.12.</HI> Now if they that are Confederate, and members of the visible Church, have a right to Baptisme, and if also the Children in Question are <HI>Confederate,</HI> and members of the <HI>visible Church,</HI> both which are affirmed by Mr. <HI>Hook|er,</HI> it must needs be that in his Judgement, the <HI>Children</HI> in Question have right to Baptisme.</P>
<P>At the same Time, and in the same Vessel with Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> and Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oker,</HI> there came the godly, learned, Mr. <HI>Samuel Stone,</HI> late Teacher of the Church in <HI>Hartford,</HI> concerning whom, what his Judge|ment was, touching the now agitated Controversies, is known from his practice in the last years of his Life. And that his Judgement was
<PB REF="000208_0016_0FA3164C0587CD50">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uitable to that practice many years before his decease, appears from a Letter of his written to the Reverend Mr. <HI>Mather of Dorchester,</HI> and bearing date <HI>Iune 6. 1650.</HI> In which Letter he thus expresseth him|self.
<Q>I <HI>Conceive,</HI> (saith Mr. <HI>Stone</HI>) that Children of <HI>Church mem|bers</HI> have right to <HI>Church membership</HI> by virtue of their <HI>Fathers Co|venant,</HI> it being granted that they are in <HI>Abrahams Covenant,</HI> they have <HI>Membership by Birth,</HI> Gal. 2.15. (2 <HI>dly.) God is their God,</HI> Gen. 17.7. (3 <HI>dly.) They are Branches,</HI> Rom. 11. (4.) they are <HI>Subjects of Christs visible Kingdome,</HI> Ezek. 37.25.</Q>
Hence,</P>
<P N="1"><Q>1. If they be presented to a Church, and Claim their Interest, they cannot be denyed, according to the Rules of the Gospel:</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. Hence there hath been a sinful neglect in <HI>New-England</HI> of such Children who have either not been presented, or not Received, when they have claimed their right. I spake with Mr. <HI>Warham,</HI> and we question not the right of Children, but we Conceive it would be Comfortable to have some Concurrence, which is that we have waited for a Long Time. And I think unless there may be some Conference of Elders this year in the <HI>Bay</HI> about it, that we may see some Reason to the Contrary, our Churches will Adventure to practice according to their Judgement, <HI>i. e.</HI> take in all such Chil|dren as members, <HI>I</HI> much desire that there may be some meeting of the Elders this year, that these things may be Considered and setled in the Churches, according to the mind of Christ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
These things do sufficiently manifest what was the Judgement of Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Stone,</HI> who all three (as was Intimated) Came in|to <HI>New-England</HI> in the same Vessel, <HI>Anno 1633.</HI> And they may justly be reckoned amongst <HI>the first three</HI> of <HI>New-Englands Worthies.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1635. God brought into this Country three more of our <HI>Worthies</HI>: Another <HI>Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irate</HI> not unlike the former, <HI>viz. Mr. Ma|ther, Mr. Norton</HI> and <HI>Mr. Shepard,</HI> whose Judgement touching the Question before us, that it did Concur with the Doctrine of the late Sy|nod, will appear from the Sequel.</P>
<P>As for Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> late Teacher of the Church in <HI>Dorchester,</HI> what the Apprehensions of that <HI>Reverend man</HI> of God were Concerning the <HI>present Controversie</HI> in his Latter Time is well known. The <HI>Anci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nts</HI> had an opinion that the <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>dying words</HI> of worthy men were <HI>Oraculous,</HI> because the Soul near its <HI>transmigra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion</HI> groweth more Divine. Be that Notion as it is, yet the <HI>dying Counsel</HI> of that blessed man to his Son, is of <HI>weighty Consideration.</HI> And that Mr. <HI>Ma|ther</HI> did not take up his perswasion concerning the <HI>Enlargement</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="000208_0017_0FA3164CC537A5C8">
<HI>Baptisme,</HI> in his last years only, but that he was of the same Judge|ment four and twenty years and more, before his decease, is evident from some <HI>Manuscripts</HI> of his left written with his own hand. For that <HI>Roverend Author</HI> did in the year 1645, prepare for the Press an <HI>elabo|rate discourse</HI> which he entituleth, <HI>A plea for the Churches of Christ in</HI> New-England, and in the second part of that discourse, which con|tains <HI>positive grounds from Scripture and Reason for the Iustification of the way of the Churches of Christ in</HI> New-England, there is this Question propounded.</P>
<P><Q>Quest. When those that were baptized in Infancy by the Cove|nant of their Parents being come to Age, are not yet found fit to be re|ceived to the Lords Table, although they be married and have Chil|dren, whether are those their Children to be baptized or no. The Answer is in these words, I propound to Consideration this Reason for the <HI>Affirmative, viz.</HI> That the Children of such Parents ought to be baptized: the Reason is, the Parents as they were born in the Covenant, so they still continue therein, being neither cast out, nor deserving so to be, and if so, why should not their Children be bapti|zed, for if the Parents be in Covenant, are not the Children so like|wis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">? Is not the Tenour of the Covenant, I <HI>will be a God to thee and to thy Seed</HI>? Is not the Text plain? <HI>Act.</HI> 2.39. <HI>the promise is to you and to your Children.</HI> And if these Children be in the Covenant, why should they no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be admitted to the Seal of the Covenant, Sith they are partakers of that, which is one main ground, why other In|fants are admitted thereto? doth it not seem unreasonable that these Infants being partakers of the ground of Baptisme as well as others, that nevertheless others should be admitted and these be refused? If other Infants were admitted to Baptisme upon some ground, whereof these were not partakers, then there might be Reason to make a diffe|rence between these Infants and others, but if the ground &amp; Reason of admitting others, be Common to these as well as to others, it seems then to be Reasonable, that these as well as others should share in the priviledge.

<Q>for my part my thoughts have been this long Time, that our Churches in general do fall short in their practice of that which the Rule requires in this particular, which I think ought to be thus, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Children of <HI>Church members</HI> submitting themselves to the <HI>Discipline of Christ in the Church,</HI> by an act of their own, when they are grown up to mens and womens Estate, ought to be <HI>watched</HI> over as other <HI>members,</HI> and to have their Infants baptized, but themselves not to be received to the <HI>Lords Table,</HI> nor to <HI>voting</HI> in the <HI>Church,</HI> till by the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">festa|tion of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> they shall approve themselves to be fit for the same. But we have not yet thus practiced, but are now Considering of the matter, and of sending to other Churches for ad|vice. Help us I pray you with your prayers that we may have grace to discern, and do the Lords mind and will herein.</Q>
So that in the year <HI>1651.</HI> it bad for a long Time been the Judgement of this <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er,</HI> that some have right to <HI>Baptisme</HI> for their Children, that yet have not

right to the <HI>Lords Supper</HI> for themselves. But against this <HI>Testimony</HI> some may object a passage in Mr. <HI>Mathers</HI> printed Catechisme, <HI>pag. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1.</HI> This holy man was sensible that some did take Advantage from an Expression therein, to impute unto him a <HI>change</HI> of <HI>Iudgement,</HI> touching this Question, which had it been so indeed, <HI>Ad meliora transire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ullus pud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> it is no dishonour to any man to change for the better, but concerning this Question, that <HI>Reverend man</HI> altered not, but was all along of the same Apprehension, wherefore knowing in his own heart that he was of the very same Judgement, when that <HI>Ca|techisme</HI> was written, as in his last years he was of, he therefore left a <HI>Manuscript</HI> in his Study to clear himself from such an Imputation, which for his Vindication, we shall therefore here Insert and publish&punc; The words are as follow.</P>
<Q><P>This Question who ought to be baptized being thus Answered in a <HI>Ca+techisme,</HI> viz. men of years when once they are converted to the <HI>Faith,</HI> and joyned to the <HI>Church,</HI> and such Infants whose Parents, both, or one of them are so <HI>Converted</HI> and <HI>joyned</HI>: The Question therefore now is, whether this Answer if sound and true, do infer that the Children of Persons <HI>Converted</HI> and joyned to the <HI>Church</HI> being now <HI>Adult,</HI> and having Children, may not be so qualified, as to have these their Children Baptized a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore they who are now the Pa|rents, be fit for the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> or if he that Answered the Questi|on in the Catechisme as above, do think they may, doth not this in|fer a change in that mans Apprehension, from what it formerly was?</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> It seems not at all to infer any such change</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Because these Apprehensions are no way contrary to one another, nor at all Inconsistent</HI>: For if a man say, that the Children last men|tioned may be baptized, this does not at all infer, that men of years converted to the <HI>Faith,</HI> and Joyned to the <HI>Church,</HI> may not be bap|tized, nor that such Infants may not be baptized, whose Parents, one, or both, are so Converted and joyned, Nor if a man Answer that such as the Catechisme speaks of may be baptized, does this infer, that those others may not, there is no Colour sure, no just ground for such Consequence, no more then if one should say, that such as are become Believers by hearing the Word preached are to be bap|tized, (which is a very Truth, <HI>Act. 2.41</HI> and <HI>8.12, 37.</HI> and <HI>18 8.</HI>) it could thence be proved, that no Infants are to be baptized, as not be|ing become Believers, at least not by that means of hearing, preaching, this would in no sort follow from the other, as if one should say, that such as do the will of God upon Earth shall enter into Heaven, &amp; that
<PB N="13" REF="000208_0020_0FA3164F059E3798">
such as <HI>feed Christ when hungry, cloath him being naked</HI>; shall be saved in Heaven, which are very true, <HI>Matth. 7.21.</HI> and <HI>25 34,</HI> &amp;c. doth this prove that <HI>Little Infants,</HI> and the <HI>Thief</HI> upon the <HI>Cross</HI> must not be saved, because the one through <HI>Imbecillity</HI> of Age, and the other through want of opportunity, did not perform the things mentioned, it doth not prove it at all, but that Salvation in Heaven may be the Portion of these as well as of the others; even so though such as the Catechisme speaks of, are to be baptized, it doth not thence follow, but that the Ordinance may be dispensed, to the In|fants of such members Children as are mentioned, and though it be dispensed to such, this is no denyal but that such as the late Cate|chisme speaks of, may be baptized, so that here is no Contradiction between the things Alledged, but that both may be true and con|sist together.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> If the words in the Catechisme had any <HI>Exclusive parti|cle</HI> in them, there had been some more ground or Colour for the Inference; as if the words had been thus, <HI>only</HI> these, or <HI>none</HI> but these are to be baptized? but any such <HI>Exclusive</HI> or <HI>Negative par|ticle</HI> there is none, and therefore the Collection or Inference from them which is made is groundless.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> The Author of the aforesaid Catechisme which was printed in the year <HI>1650.</HI> had sundry Times before in the years <HI>1646. 1648. 1649.</HI> publickly delivered his Judgement, both by word of mouth, and by writing that such Children of Church members might have their Infants baptized, though themselves were not yet received to the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> and so divers Times again in the years follow|ing. And therefore it is not probable, that what is expressed in the said <HI>Catechisme</HI> should be intended by him to have such a meaning as is quite Contrary to what himself had publickly Delivered both before, and after, and that at sundry Times, and in several wayes.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>ly. Other Authors of much worth for holiness and Learning, who never meant to deny Baptisme to such Children of Church members as are spoken of,</HI> yet in Answer to that Question, who ought to be baptiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d? or to whom is Baptisme to be administred, have expressed themselves in Terms, not far unlike to those in the aforesaid Catechisme, Mr. <HI>Balls</HI> words are these, who ought to be baptized?

<P N="5">5 <HI>ly.</HI> If the Parents spoken of may notwithstanding their <HI>unfitness</HI> for that <HI>Ordinance</HI> of the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> yet be truly said to be <HI>Con|verted to the Faith,</HI> and <HI>joyned to the Church,</HI> then the appearance of Contradiction is at an end. Now for the one of these <HI>Qualifications,</HI> viz. That they be <HI>Converted to the Faith,</HI> if <HI>Faith</HI> be taken as it of|ten is for the <HI>Doctrine of Faith,</HI> as <HI>Act. 6.7.

And does not this imply some <HI>beginning of Faith</HI>? Can persons have all these <HI>Qualifications,</HI> and yet for all this be <HI>utterly destitute</HI> of <HI>the grace of Faith</HI>? It seems not suitable to <HI>Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity</HI> to judge so. And in as much as men have neither <HI>Faith,</HI> nor any thing that good is by Nature, therefore they that have it may be said to be <HI>converted to it,</HI> and so the <HI>Parents,</HI> the <HI>baptizing</HI> of whose Children is in Question, are not without the one of the <HI>Qualifications</HI> mentioned in the Catechisme, <HI>viz.</HI> of being <HI>Converted to the Faith.</HI> And for the other, <HI>viz.</HI> of being joyned to the Church, this cannot be denyed touching these Parents, for as much, as by means of the Covenant, which takes in Parents and Children, they have been either born in the Church, or taken in, in

their Infancy, and so they were joyned to the Church, If so, they continue still, being neither Cast out, nor deserving so to be, and therefore their Infants are the Children of Parents joyned to the Church. And lest it should be said, that though they were in the Church in their Infancy and <HI>minority,</HI> yet now being <HI>Adult,</HI> they fall out, or go out by their own <HI>default,</HI> in neglecting the duty per|taining to the <HI>Adult,</HI> therefore for the preventing of this, it is here said, that they solemnly owned the Covenant before the Church, and therein give up themselves and their Children to the Lord, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that here is a personal and publick act of their own, in respect of the Covenant, and giving up themselves and their Children to the Lord, by their own act, with a Subjection of themselves to the <HI>Go|vernment of Christ</HI> in his Church, whereby it appears that as these Parents were in the Church in their <HI>minority,</HI> and were never since Cast out, so neither are they fallen out by their own neglect; But do manifest their Continuance in the Church, and in the Covenant by their own personal act. And so the other <HI>Qualification</HI> of Pa|rents, whose Children are to be <HI>baptized,</HI> which the Catechisme mentioned, is found in the Parents spoken of, <HI>viz.</HI> that they are persons joyned to the Church, and therefore he that affirms tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> these may have their Children <HI>baptized,</HI> does not Contradict the fore-mentioned Catechisme at all, nor is there any thing in the Catechisme against the baptizing of these Children.</P></Q>
<P>This which ha's been expressed, may be suffieient for the vindication of that <HI>Reverend</HI> and <HI>Honoured person.</HI></P>
<P>We proceed rherefore to Mr. <HI>Nortons Iudgement</HI> concerning the present Controversy, and that the Apprehensions of that <HI>Iudicious</HI> and <HI>Eagle eyed Seer</HI> did Concur with those Servants of the Lord, which have been mentioned, is apparent, both from what himself did often publickly teach, not only in <HI>Boston,</HI> but in <HI>Ipswich</HI>; and from a Script composed <HI>Anno 1654.</HI> by that learned hand, which because it is <HI>a|cute, clear,</HI> and <HI>distinct,</HI> (according to the wonted manner of that <HI>great Author</HI>) and because it was never yet published, we shall therefore here Insert it: It is that which follows.</P>

<P>Quest. <HI>Whether the Children of Parents in Church Covenant are Church members and ought to be baptized.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Children of Parents in Church Covenant are Church members, and ought to be baptized. This Answer stands upon the proof of these five propositions.</P>

<P N="5">5. <HI>This distinct membership gives them a proper right unto Baptisme, so as they are baptized by their own right, and not by the right of their Parents.</HI></P>
<P>Proposition. I.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Children are capable of Confederating in a publick person</HI>:</P>
<P>A publick person is when some one of a Society doth by the Law in such an Act stand for the whole Society. So he that is but one person <HI>Physically,</HI> is <HI>Politically</HI> as many persons as the Law makes him, Since Religion and Reason both allow and require <HI>human<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Laws</HI> to create such publick persons for the good of the Community, much more may we see Cause, why they may be constituted, by the divine Law of him, whose <HI>Sole Prerogative</HI> it is, that he may do whatsoever he pleaseth.</P>

<HI>Children under the Gospel Confederate in their Parents,</HI> because to the Children of Parents in Covenant, that promise <HI>Gen. 17 7.</HI> doth belong, <HI>Acts 2.39.</HI> because they are holy, <HI>1 Cor. 7.14.</HI> which Holiness cannot be understood to be any but external Holi|ness, nor can that external be reasonably interpreted of any but Church holiness suitable to the like phrase, <HI>Rom. 11.16.</HI> &mdash; Be|cause Children are baptized, which Baptisme is the Gospel Circum|cision, <HI>Col. 2.11, 12.</HI> therefore in Church Covenant, but Covenant they do not in their proper persons, therefore in their publick per|sons, <HI>viz&punc;</HI> their Parents.</P>

<P>Proposition IV.</P>
<P>This distinct membership gives them a proper right unto Bap|tisme, so as they are not baptized by the right of their Parents, but by their own right. (1.) Such as their membership is, such is their right unto Baptisme. But their membership as hath been already proved

Members are to be considered either in respect of their Communion, or in respect of their membership. In respect of their Communion they may be said to be compleat or incompleat; be|cause Communion receives more or less, and may be enjoyed either in whole or in part, But if members be considered, in respect of membership which is the present Query, then they cannot be said to be compleat, or incompleat, because membership being a Rela|tion doth not receive more or less, as a little member is as truly a member as the greatest, the hand of a Child is truly a hand, and member of the whole as the hand of a man.</P>

Though <HI>Adam</HI> Confederated in his own person. <HI>i. e.</HI> although it be the person of <HI>Adam</HI> that Confederated, yet <HI>Adam</HI> himself Confederated not as a single person, but as a publick person, so as though <HI>Adam</HI> and the Parents of Children <HI>Confederate</HI> Imme|diately, <HI>i. e.</HI> in their own persons, yet do they not confederate as single persons.

The validity of membership depends not upon the In|strument or medium to wit, the Parents standing as a publick per|son in the Act of Confederation, but upon the Institution of God in Christ, the value and virtue of the effect here cannot depend, upon the medium (which is it self also an Arbitrary Effect) but upon the supream and Independent Cause, The membership of a male Child Confederating mediately, <HI>i. e.</HI> in the publick person of the Mother, excelleth the memb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rship of the Mother Confederating Immediate|ly in her own person, because the Mother though she be a Church member, yet is not capable of being a member constituent of the Church (for only Brethren constitute a Church, in that they alone

The Cause why a member is not admitted to such and such Communion, is not any defect in membership, but some defect con|cerning the qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lification of the member. The mother notwithstand|ing her membership is inferiour to the membership of her male Child, (she being as was said before <HI>a member</HI> of the Church, but not a <HI>member Constituent</HI> of a Church) is admitted to the Supper, yet the Child is not. A man or woman Adult&punc; Confederating in their own persons immediately upon some offence possibly falling out or discovered between their Admission and intended Baptisme, may not be baptized, where as a Child Confederated in his publick p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r|son is to be baptized.</P>

<P>I was glad at the receipt of your Letters, but I am sorry to hear of such breaches in Churches, and no way nor means found out and ap|plyed for healing, which I fear with you does strengthen the <HI>Pres|byterian Objection</HI> against our <HI>Congregational way,</HI> when the writings of some for our defence, and our practice agree not in that particular. I think with you that man to be much blessed, whom God should make helpful in those things; though as he ha's but little encourage|ment to attempt it, so can he expect less thanks from man who pos|sibly may have erred, but loth to be judged so to have done.&mdash;Touch|ing your own Exercises you are not alone in them, the power of the El|ders in preparing matters of offence and other things for the Church, has been much questioned by some, But me-thinks that which Mr <HI>Hook|er</HI> ha's written in the Case (Survey <HI>pt. 3d. pag. 33.</HI>) should satisfy those who are not of a <HI>Contentious Spirit,</HI> I had Conference with him about this matter, in his life time. And the Summe of what he hath now written, he then expressed and told me withal, that if a Case should be presented to the Church, in any other way by the Brethren he would refuse to act in it, unless the Church would first dispute the point which he would offer, but act against his Judgement he would not, It's true that the Rule requires to tell the Church in due order by the Officers, as he that Commands one to goe into his house, intends that he should go in by the door.</P>

(pag. 183.184.)</HI> which because they were amongst <HI>the last words</HI> of so holy a man, cannot without great sin be <HI>despised</HI> or <HI>disregarded.</HI> Also we might have mentioned the Judge|ment of <HI>Reverend</HI> Mr. <HI>Norris</HI>; which that it did Concur with what hath been expressed, is to be seen from the <HI>Records</HI> of the Church in <HI>Salem,</HI> viz. in their <HI>Records</HI> of the 24<HI>th.</HI> of the <HI>first Moneth</HI>: And of the <HI>9th.</HI> of the <HI>fifth Moneth</HI> and <HI>sixth Moneth, Anno 1654.</HI> Likewise we might have produced the Judgement of Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> sometimes the <HI>faithful Pastor</HI> of the Church in <HI>Watertown,</HI> but the Reader is for that referred to the Preface in the <HI>Synod Book.</HI></P>
<P>Also that some <HI>godly</HI> and <HI>Iudicious</HI> of the <HI>Congregational way</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> are for a <HI>greater Latitude</HI> in the point of Baptisme, then our <HI>dissenting Antisynodalian Brethren</HI> do acknowledge, is manifest from what <HI>sundry Learned men</HI> of that <HI>way</HI> have long since published. For Doctor <HI>Owen</HI> in his review of <HI>Schisme, pag 134</HI> thus expresses himself,
<Q>I am so far from confining Baptisme <HI>subjectively</HI> to a <HI>particu|lar Congregation,</HI> that I do not believe that any m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mber of a <HI>particular Church</HI> was ever <HI>regularly baptized</HI>; baptisme precedes <HI>Admission</HI> in|to <HI>Church membership</HI> as to a <HI>particular Church,</HI> the Subject of it is <HI>professing Believers</HI> and their Seed, as such, they have right unto it, whether they be joyned to any <HI>particular Church,</HI> or no, suitable to this Judgement ha's been my <HI>Constant</HI> and <HI>uninterrupted practice.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Likewise Doctor <HI>Nathaniel Homes</HI> in his defence of <HI>Infant Baptisme</HI> against Mr. <HI>Tombs,</HI> ha's these words, <HI>(pag. 193.)</HI>
<Q>for baptizing of Believers Infants, several Churches of us do hold, that we may bap|tize them, though neither of their Parents be of our <HI>particular Chur|ches.</HI> Baptisme as we conceive being an <HI>Admission</HI> into the <HI>univer|sal visible Church,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
And again, (<HI>pag. 217.</HI>) Mr. <HI>Tombs</HI> having made this Objection,
<Q>that the baptizing of Infants ha's occasioned an unnecessary dispute about baptizing the Infants of believing Parents, that are not members of <HI>gathered Churches.</HI> I never (saith Doctor <HI>Homes</HI>) perceived the world troubled with this dispute, divers Chur|ches without dispute can practice the baptizing of such, &amp;c.</Q>
Thus he. See also in the same Book, <HI>207, 208, 215.</HI> with his Epistle to the Reader. And the Collector of these Testimonies hath lately received Letters from <HI>su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dry eminent Divines</HI> of the <HI>Congregational way</HI> in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> declaring that the <HI>Iu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gement</HI> of the <HI>Elders</HI> with them is generally

according to what hath been now expressed. By these things there|fore, which have been thus far expressed, it is very manifest that the doctrine of the late Synod concerning the Subject of Baptisme is no A|postacy from the <HI>first Principles of</HI> New-England, <HI>nor yet any declension from the Congregational way.</HI> It remaineth that we proceed to the other Question about <HI>Communion and Consocia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of Churches.</HI> Now concerning that, it is less needful to produce <HI>many Testimonies,</HI> that there in the Synod <HI>Introduceth</HI> not any <HI>Innovation.</HI> For some that dissent|ed from the Answer to the first Question about Baptisme, yet in this last concurred yea, there was an <HI>unanimous and universal Assent</HI> to the An|swer given to this second Question, as the Author of the <HI>Antisynodalia Americana</HI> does acknowledge, where (<HI>pag. 12.</HI>) it is said <HI>in the second Question we do fully agree with the rest of the Synod, in all the Propositions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid down about it together with the Proofs thereof,</HI> we shall therefore amongst our <HI>New English Worthies,</HI> only mention the Judgement of Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> concerning this Question, which what it is may be seen larg|ly expressed in his Book of the <HI>Keyes, pag. 54,</HI> &amp;c. And there are those that will remember, that when that eminent Minister of Christ Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> was ordained Pastor of the Church in <HI>Cambridg,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> giving in the Name of the Messengers of Churches, <HI>the right hand of Fellowship,</HI> seriously advised him to endeavour (And that faithful man was ever mindful of that solemn Advice) that that Ordinance of <HI>Conso|ciation of Churches</HI> might be duly practised, greatly bewailing the de|fect of these Churches, as to that particular, yea, Mr. <HI>Cotton<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> heart was much upon this thing, in his latter time; foreseeing that without it, these Churches and the <HI>Congregational way</HI> could not stand; He did therefore not long before his decease, draw up some <HI>Propositions</HI> which are expressive of the way and manner of this <HI>Consociation</HI> pleaded for, which because they are (as being written by his hand, they cannot but be) of great weight and worth, we shall therefore here insert and pub|lish them.</P>

<P>Although the Apostles of Christ were <HI>Independent</HI> on each other, and had equally the <HI>highest Power Ecclesiastical under Christ,</HI> and were led with <HI>Infallible Assistance</HI> of the Spirit in the exercise there|of, yet <HI>Paul</HI> with <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> went up to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> (and that by <HI>Revelation</HI>) not only to Confer and Consult with the Apo|stles about his doctrine, (lest he had, or should <HI>run in vain,</HI> Gal 2.1, 2.) but also Consociated or made Agreement with them by mutual giving <HI>the right hand of Fellowship,</HI> to dispose the Course of their Ministry and Provision for the poor, that so they might procure the more free and effectual passage of the fruit of the Gospel, and the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k of their Ministry, and therefore it may seem much rather, not only lawful, but also very profitable and needful for ordinary Elders, (and Churches though equal in Power) wanting that <HI>Infallible Assi|stance</HI> of the Spirit to Confer, and Consult, and Consociate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> agree together about all such weighty matters, in which Counsel and Con|currence of Judgment may be requisite to prevent and heal errors and offences, to avoid Sus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ition of prejudice, and partiality, and so to expedite the free passage of the Gospel in the hands of them all.</P>

<P>Out of Question, <HI>the Lord Iesus, the head, King and Compassionate high Priest and Saviour of his body the Church, hath as great a Love and care of the purity, Peace and Edif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cation of whole Churches,</HI> as of particular Saints as is evident by those <HI>Epistles sent to the Churches of</HI> Corinth, Galatia, <HI>and the seven Churches of</HI> Asia, to heal the publick Errors, dissentions, and other Corruptions found in them, and there|fore certainly he hath appointed and sanctified some sufficient means to preserve their purity and peace, to heal and help the evils and distempers of whole Churches, as well as of particular Believers. Now then since Apostles and other extraordinary Officers are ceased, (that had power in all Churches, and only Love remaineth) what other Ecclesiastical help is there left without infringing the power of particular Churches, but the Exercise of brotherly Love, mutual watchfulness, Brotherly Care, and Counsel? which Elders and Chur|ches ought therefore to practice towards each other in this way of Brotherly Communion and Assistance on all just occasions.</P>

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>Proposition V.</HEAD>
<P>Upon these and other Scripture grounds and Examples, and for the ends above said, it is very meet and requisite, (according to our present practice) that when any Company of Christians intend to unite themselves into the Fellowship of a Church, or being in a Church state to elect and ordain any Elders over them, that in due time they signify their intentions to the Neighbouring Churches, walking in the order of the Gospel, if such may be had, desiring their presence, Assistance, and <HI>right hand of Fellowship,</HI> that as a Church is a City <HI>set upon a Hill,</HI> so the Acts thereof may not be as <HI>a Light put under a Bushel,</HI> but may so shine forth to all other Churches, behold|ing and approving their orderly proceedings, as they may the more readily give them <HI>the right hand of Fellowship,</HI> and walk with more freedom of Spirit in Brotherly Love and Communion with them in the Lord.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have deliberately read over Mr. <HI>D^s. Essay</HI> and Epistle to the Reader, which I now return to you with thanks for the <HI>Loan</HI> of it, If I should say, I see not matter of Conviction in it, his Answer is al|ready given me, (<HI>pag. 35&punc;</HI>)
<Q>If men shut their eyes, when the light is held out to them, they may truly say they see not,</Q> or in <HI>pag. 6.</HI><Q> they that Enquire of God with an <HI>Idol in their hearts,</HI> shall be <HI>paenally</HI> an|swered by being left to their own Counsels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> we had need Labour to approve our selves to God, when we meet with such <HI>sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rp Censures</HI> from men.
But the <HI>R. A.</HI> can hardly expect, we should find Conviction here, seeing he builds all upon this distinction of <HI>Immediate</HI> and <HI>medi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te membership,</HI> which with the <HI>Consectaries</HI> He deduceth from it, is the <HI>pror<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp; puppis</HI> of his whole discourse: and for the proof of the distinction himself, in (<HI>pag. 34, 35.</HI>) refers the Reader to his <HI>former Essays</HI>; nei|ther have I observed much more in this writing, toward the proof of it, then we have had before. And therefore if we did not see it (as by him ex|plained and Improved) to be evident before, it is not strange, if we do not see it now. If it must be imputed to our <HI>blindness</HI> (yea, <HI>wilful</HI> and <HI>paenal blindnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>) that we see it not, we must be Content, to bear it as we may. Also when he affirms over and over (<HI>pag. 75, 83, 92, 103, 131, 145, 152.</HI>) that we our selves Confess the Parents in Question have not Faith, or are not <HI>visible Believers,</HI> the Contrary whereunto we have plainly asserted. And how many times over does he say it, [we call them <HI>meer members.</HI>] which we have disclaimed, and do not so call them but, [members not in <HI>full Communion</HI>] yea, he sayes, (<HI>in pag. 49.</HI>) we grant that the persons in Question, are not to be accounted <HI>Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch members,</HI> &amp;c. How should we receive Conviction from such dis|courses? If his meaning be by so often reflecting on [our <HI>meer members</HI> as he calls them] to deny that distinction of members into [such as are in <HI>full Communion,</HI> and such as are not in <HI>full Communion</HI>] that would seem strange, for how can that be denyed by any <HI>Paedobaptists,</HI> and he seems to approve it in <HI>pag. 35.</HI> yea, he seems sometimes to grant, that some when <HI>Adult</HI> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Continue in the Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch and Covenant, who yet are not admitted to <HI>full Communion, pag. 76.99,</HI> yet he calls for a Rule for two such sorts of <HI>Adult members, pag. 73.</HI> But I shall not en|enter

into discourse of <HI>particulars,</HI> nor am I fit to be an Answerer, it is easie to observe a <HI>greater sharpness</HI> in his Expressions to me then else where in this Book. I hope I shall Consider as I am able, what I find in this, or other discourses, about the matter in Controversy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if I be convinced of Error, I shall not be ashamed to own it, but if there be no way to Issue the <HI>Controversy</HI> but by such <HI>voluminous writings,</HI> and if every passage be not spoken to, he counts himself neglected, or unan|swered; And that which he hath before said stands still firm and good, (as to that purpose he speaks in this Book above twenty times) I have little hope to see an Issue of it, nor can I see any likely way for an Issue, unless we can meet, (either in way of <HI>Synod</HI> or <HI>Colioquie</HI>) and with <HI>freedom</HI> and <HI>Candor verbally</HI> and <HI>fully</HI> discourse the matter, and agree to some <HI>orderly Conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">usion. As for the Substance of the Cause, where|in we have engaged, I am daily more and more Confirmed, that it is the Cause of Truth, and of Christ, and that wherein not a little of the Interest of Christs Kingdome, and of the Souls of men is laid up.</HI> I have heard you intimate, as if there were failings in the manner of Calling, and the managing of the <HI>late Synod,</HI> and you speak of your <HI>expunging</HI> some pas|sages in what passed the Press, which would have discovered the naked|ness of the contrary minded, (though I suppose if they had been print|ed, they would have discovered more the nakedness of the Author, or Authors, then of the Subjects of those Expressions and Informations.) And I once had an Intimation, as if some had gathered up a <HI>Narrative</HI> of matters that would shame us much, if it should be published. To all which I would say, I do not know of any such great matter, that can be objected, <HI>or of ought Considerable,</HI> that would seem strange [if things be rightly represented] among men of Infirmity as we all are.

provoked unto Anger.</HI> And how farr those few in the Ministry that have appeared in opposition may have been accessary thereunto, I had rather they would seriously Consider between the Lord and their own Souls, then I go about to determine. We have been reflected upon by some as seeking our selves, and driving on I know not what design, and I cannot readily Imagine, what <HI>Self Interest</HI> or <HI>Self End</HI> we here should be led by in this matter. Sure I am for my own part, <HI>that I prejudice my self much, as to name, Interest, Ease,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>For my appearing in this Cause.</HI> Neither was I so insensible, as not to feel it from the first. I know my self to be a <HI>poor, vile, sinful Creature,</HI> and can with some feel|ing say, <HI>chief of Sinners, and least of Saints, but in this particular mat|ter</HI> I <HI>have often said, I wish my Brethren could see through me, for I know not any design or desire I have in it, in all the world, but only that the will of God might be done among us, his Kingdome be advanced, these Chur|ches setled on right Bases, and flourish in the wayes of Truth, Purity and Peace,</HI> and that the good of the Souls of men might be promoted both in this, and <HI>after Generations.</HI></P>
<P>I am sorry to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hnd thus many Lines about the <HI>Circumstantials</HI> of the Cause; the prejudices that are thence taken up against it, have drawn me thus farr. But touching the matter it self, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hath been in debate between us (which I had rather be discoursing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">) you may please to Consider at Leisure which of these three Propositions you would deny.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The whole visible Church under the New Testament is to be baptized-</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If a man be once in the Church (whether admitted at Age or in In|fancy) nothing less then Censurable evil can put him out.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If the Parent be in the visible Church his Infant Child is so also&punc;</HI></P>
<P>The first is proved by the Arguments for the <HI>Synods first Proposition,</HI> the second is plain from the <HI>Current</HI> of <HI>Scripture,</HI> and Confirmed under the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> (besides other Reasons) from the Carriage of Christ and his Apostles towards the Jewes, who came into the Church by a <HI>memb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rship</HI> received in <HI>Infancy.</HI> The third must be owned by all, but <HI>Antipaedo Baptists.</HI> The Frame of the Covenant, <HI>Gen, 17.</HI> inferrs it, and Mr. <HI>D. imprinted Essay, pag. 23.</HI> grants that the Promise of the Covenant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not stop at the <HI>Infant Child. These three things are all of them the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ctrine of all our great Divines, as well as of the Scrip|tures.</HI></P>
<P>It is to me a Confirmation to observe <HI>de facto,</HI> that in the way of <HI>suc|cessive baptizing</HI> the Children of all that had a standing in the <HI>visible Church</HI> (though with too much <HI>Laxeness</HI> and <HI>Corruption</HI> for want of
<PB N="5" REF="000208_0052_0FA316678FB88558">
Discipline) the Lord hath continued <HI>Religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> among <HI>Christian People</HI> from Age to Age, whereas the like Continuance and Preservation of true Religion could not have been hoped for, nor propable in the Con|trary way.</P>
<P>It was never heard of in the world from <HI>Abraham</HI> to this day [since God appointed an <HI>entering Sign,</HI> or such <HI>a Livery to be worn by his peo|ple to distinguish them from the world</HI>] that a people did Continue for any length of Time to be Religious, who were either all, or the greater part of them <HI>uncircumcised</HI> or <HI>unbaptized.</HI></P>
<P>The laying aside of <HI>Circumcision</HI> among the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dianites,</HI> for that they did betimes lay it aside, may be plainly gathered from <HI>Exod.</HI> 4. <HI>24, 25, 26.</HI> was quickly followed with the utter Loss of all true Religion a|mong them, and other of the Posterity of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Keturah.</HI></P>
<P>I know the bare having of Baptisme does not alwayes keep true Re|ligion but sure it is, that the want of it will quickly lose Religion among a people To say that a people may be Religious well enough without Baptisme, would be to reflect upon the wisdom of Christ, in appoint|ing such an <HI>external Sign</HI> of <HI>Christianity,</HI> which surely was no needless thing; It is easie to see that in the way your self and some others go, <HI>the bigger half of the people in this Country will in a little Time be unbapti|zed,</HI> Mr. <HI>D.</HI> sayes in his <HI>Essay, pag. 55.</HI> that our <HI>meer members</HI> as he calls them, will soon be a farr greater number then his <HI>Sheep</HI> and <HI>Lambs, i. e.</HI> then his <HI>Immediate</HI> and <HI>mediate members,</HI> both of them, and all the Generations of these <HI>meer members</HI> [as he calls them] he would have unbaptized, now I leave it to Consideration, how <HI>subversive to Re|ligion this will soon be, as also how absurd a thing that a Christian pro|fessing people, yea, eminently professing, and of a more reformed temper then ordinarily the world both known.</HI> [As through grace the body of peo|ple of this Country, yea, and of our members not in <HI>full Communion</HI> yet are] <HI>should so soon be the body of them unbaptized, as if they were not a Christian, but an Heathen People.</HI> Let me add this farther Conside|ration, all <HI>Disciples</HI> or <HI>[Acts 11.26.] Christians</HI> are by Christ enjoyn|ed to be baptized, <HI>Math. 28.19 Acts 11.26.</HI> states it upon these peo|ple that are called [named or counted] Christians, I know there are that arrogate to themselves the Name of Christians who are <HI>manifest Anti-Christians, as Papists, Athiests,</HI> &amp;c. these may be excluded, but those who [<HI>in regard both of their belief and practice</HI>] do justly and right|ly retain the Reputation of Christians, as they that are described in our fifth Proposition, and the <HI>Generality</HI> of the People in this Country can&punc; not be denyed to do, surely <HI>Christs Injunction</HI> doth include them.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000208_0053_0FA31667C698D7C0"><HI>We may observe that Congregational men in</HI> England <HI>are not without thoughts and studies for enlargement of Baptisme.</HI> Doctor <HI>Owen</HI> in his late Catechisme, is plainly with us in the main Substance of the Cause, <HI>viz.</HI> the baptizing of those we plead for, though it seems he would have them baptized in another Notion. For when as in Question 38 he makes the proper Subject of Baptisme to <HI>be professing Believers and their Infant Seed, it is p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain he intends Baptisme to many, who</HI> (according to his <HI>Platform</HI>) are not in <HI>full Communion,</HI> or may not come to the <HI>Lords Table,</HI> nay, <HI>are not</HI> (with him) <HI>so much as joyned members</HI> of <HI>a par|ticular or instituted Church,</HI> but are only professors of the Faith, Com|pare Question <HI>19.39, 47&punc; 49.</HI> And I suppose, there are Expressions to that purpose in other writings of his, which I have not now by me. The same thing may be Contained under the Expression at the meeting of the <HI>Savoy</HI> in their <HI>Confession of Faith, Chap. 29. Thes. 4. [the Infants of one or both believing Parents are to be baptized,]</HI> using therein the words of the <HI>Assemblies Confession,</HI> and we know in how large a Sense they take the word [<HI>believing</HI>] when as they say in <HI>Chap 26. Thes 2.</HI> The whole body of men throughout the world, pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">essing the Faith of the Gospel, and obedience unto God by Christ, according unto it, not destroying their own Profession by any errors, everting the <HI>Foundation,</HI> or <HI>unholiness</HI> of Conversation, are, and may be called the <HI>visible Catho|lick Church of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>How plain is it, that <HI>the persons whose Children we would have bapti|zed are professing Believers according to Doctor Owens Expressions,</HI> be|lieving Parents in the Assemblies Sense, and such Professors o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Faith of the Gospel, and of obedience to God, as do not otherwise destroy that Profession, all which (say the <HI>Savoy meeting</HI>) are of the <HI>visible Ca|tholick Church of Christ.</HI> And I suppose, <HI>they would not have any part of Christs visible Church left unbaptized.</HI> 'Tis true they say, this <HI>visible Catholick Church of Christ</HI> as such, is not intrusted with the <HI>Administra|tion</HI> of any Ordinance, but they may mean, as many do expressly hold, that <HI>the person A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ministring Baptisme must be an Officer in a particu|lar Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h, though the Subjects baptiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d may be of the Catholick Church.</HI> How ever such <HI>Catholick Professors</HI> as they here describe, are qualified for Baptisme, If taking hold of the Covenant in a particular Church be (in their mind) further needful, ours do that.</P>
