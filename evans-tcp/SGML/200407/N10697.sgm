<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN times of public calamity, it is the duty of a good citizen <HI>to consider.</HI> If his opportunities or advantages, for knowledge and reflection, are greater than those of mankind in general, his whole duty will remain undischarged, while he confines his thoughts to the compass of his own mind. But if <HI>danger</HI> is added to the <HI>calamity</HI> of the times, he who shall communicate his sentiments on public affairs with decency and <HI>frankness,</HI> merits attenti|on and indulgence, if he may not aspire to appro|bation and praise.</P>
<P>Whoever attends to the tenor and design of the late act of the British Parliament for the BLOCKADE OF this HARBOUR, and duly considers the extensive confusion and distress this measure must inevitably produce; whoever shall reflect upon the justice; po|licy and humanity of legislators, who could delibe|rately give their sanction to such a proceedure&mdash;must be satisfied, that the man, who shall OPENLY <HI>dare to expose their conduct,</HI> hazards fatal consequences.&mdash;Legislators, who could condemn a whole town un|heard, nay uncited to answer; who could involve thousands in ruin and misery, without suggestion of any crime <HI>by them</HI> committed; and who could so construct their law, as that enormous pains and pe|nalties
<PB N="4" REF="013561_0005_0F90FEFA1FA0C570">
would <HI>inevitably</HI> ensue, NOTWITHSTAND|ING THE MOST PERFECT OBEDIENCE TO IT'S IN|JUNCTIONS; I say, that legislators, thus <HI>formed as</HI> MEN, thus principled as STATESMEN, would un|doubtedly imagine the attainder and death of a private individual, for his public animadversions, a less extraordinary act of power. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since this treatise was advertised in the public papers, as be|ing in the press, the author hath received, from the British Coffee-House, an anonymous Let<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ter, in which he is represented as being "in eminent hazard of THE LOSS OF LIFE <HI>and confiscation of estate:</HI>" It is said, that <Q>I shall very probably get into the hands of a <HI>power,</HI> from which no power I can call to will be able to deliver me.</Q>&mdash;There is (says the writer) <Q>but one expe|dient left to save me:</Q>&mdash;<Q>Employ, for GOD's sake, those rare talents, with which (faith the artful flatterer) he hath blessed you, in convincing THE PEOPLE that they have <HI>nothing to do, but to</HI> SUBMIT, and make their peace WITH GOVERNMENT:&mdash;You may, (continues be) by this means probably make your peace, and ward off the punishment that hangs over your head. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> possible, THAT GOVERNMENT may still continue IT'S GREAT LENITY, and overlook your offences.</Q> The Reader is left to his own Reflections.</NOTE> But all exerti|ons of duty have their hazard:&mdash;if dread of Par|liamentary extravagance is to deter from public energies, <HI>the safety of the common wealth will soon be despaired of;</HI> and when once a sentiment of that kind prevails, the excesses of present enormities so rapidly increase, that strides, at first appearance, ex|orbitant, will soon be found&mdash;but <HI>the beginning of evils.</HI> We therefore consider it as a just observa|tion, that the weight and velocity of public op|pressions are ever in a ratio proportionate to private despondency and public despair.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="013561_0006_0F90FEFAE42B4318">He who shall go about to treat of important and <HI>perilous</HI> concerns, and conceals himself behind the curtain of a feigned signature, gives an advantage to his adversaries; who will not fail to stigmatize his thoughts, as the notions of an unknown writer, afraid or ashamed to avow his sentiments; and hence they are deemed unworthy of notice and re|futation. Therefore I give to the world both my sentiments and name upon the present occasion, and shall hear with patience him, who will decent|ly refute what is advanced, and shall submit with temper to that correction and chastisement which my errors deserve.</P>
<P>The act now under consideration opens with a recital, that <Q>dangerous <HI>commotions and insurrections</HI> have been fomented and raised in Boston&mdash;by di|vers ill-affected persons, to the subversion of his Majesty's Government, and to the utter destruc|tion of the public peace, and good order of the said town; in which commotions and insur|rections certain valuable cargoes of Teas, be|ing <HI>the property of the East-India Company,</HI> and on board certain vessels lying within the bay or harbour of Boston, were seized and destroyed: and in the present condition of said town and harbour, the commerce of his Majesty's subjects cannot be safely carried on there, nor the customs payable to his Majesty be duly collected.</Q></P>
<P>Two questions naturally arise out of this pream|ble: The first, whether <HI>the facts</HI> set forth are <HI>true;</HI> and Secondly, whether <HI>upon a supposition of their truth,</HI> they are a sufficient foundation for the subsequent parts of the statute, or will warrant the disabilities, forfeitures, pains and penalties, enacted and inflict|ed on the subject?&mdash;Both inquiries seem intimately to concern the honour and justice of the British le|gislature.
<PB N="6" REF="013561_0007_0F90FEFBCD75C918">
And however unimportant the judg|ment of Americans may now appear to that august body&mdash;yet surely the judgment of Europe and fu|ture ages is not unworthy their high consideration. Removed from the eye of royalty, the piety of a So|vereign may cease to pity miseries it doth not behold; remote from the cries of public justice and the efforts of popular despair, Lords and Commons may re|main unaffected, for a season, with American con|vulsions; yet justice and humanity must soon ex|cite those operations in America and Europe, which hereafter will move even the senate of Britain. True knowledge and real virtue perhaps was never more diffused than on this northern continent; re|fined humanity ('tis boasted) was never more pre|dominant than in Europe at this day:&mdash;Can it be supposed, that this virtue will be discordant and inactive; that this knowledge will omit to unfold public wrongs, or that such humanity will cease to interpose?</P>
<P>That commotions were in Boston; that East|India tea was destroyed, are facts not controverted. But that such commotions were natural to be ex|pected; that they were such as <HI>statesmen</HI> must have <HI>foreseen</HI> and A FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY, who fore|saw, would prevent, rather than punish, is equal|ly true. The sentiments of all Americans relative to the Tea act are no secret, their fervor in the COMMON CAUSE equally known; and their probable intemperance in consequence of the arrival of In|dia teas, it required no profound skill in men and politics to predict. Nay the British papers were full, and the senate echoed, with the predictions similar to those which are now fulfilled. It was not difficult for <HI>Englishmen in Britain</HI> to tell how
<PB N="7" REF="013561_0008_0F90FEFD0BD1E100">
<HI>Englishmen in America</HI> would conduct on such occa|sions. What shall we then say? Shall we impute to those, who are dignified as "the wisest and most august" the barbarous projection&mdash;deliberately to ensnare, that they might superlatively punish? The calm deliberation of premeditated malice seems ra|ther more characteristick of a <HI>private</HI> bosom, than a <HI>public body.</HI> But Governor Hutchinson (the repre|sentative of his Majesty in this Province) when treating upon an act of <HI>the Massachusetts Government imposing</HI> a tax or <HI>duty</HI> upon goods of the inhabitants of <HI>other colonies,</HI> hath assured us, that <Q>in all ages and countries, by <HI>bodies</HI> and <HI>communities of men</HI> such deeds have been done as most of the individuals of which such communities consisted, acting se|parately, would have been <HI>ashamed of.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Vol. Mass. Hist. page 156.</NOTE> An ob|servation that his Excellency might have imbibed, from that prince of historians, Dr. Robertson. <Q>To abandon <HI>usurped power,</HI> to renounce <HI>lucrative</HI> er|ror, are sacrifices, which the virtue of <HI>individuals,</HI> has, on some occasions, offered to TRUTH; but from ANY SOCIETY <HI>of men,</HI> no such effort can be expected. <HI>The corruptions of society,</HI> recommended by common utility, and justified by universal practice, are viewed by it's members, <HI>without shame or horror;</HI> and reformation <HI>never</HI> proceeds from themselves, but is <HI>always</HI> FORCED upon them by some FOREIGN hand.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hist. Scotland, 1 Vol. page 167.</NOTE> <Q>Caesar, Le|pidus and Antony, says Plutarch, shew, that no beast is more <HI>savage</HI> than man, when possessed of <HI>power equal to his passion.</HI></Q> If the sentiments of Dr. Robertson are just, have we not cause to fear from <HI>very powerful</HI> states and legislators an equal ferocity?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="013561_0009_0F90FEFFE63FEE60">And it is an observation of the illustrious Lord Clarendon, that it is the nature of man, rather to commit two errors, than retract one. When eleva|ted characters commit a <HI>second</HI> error, it carries the air of an intended discovery, how little they feel for the <HI>first,</HI> how much they despise <HI>the people,</HI> how much they are above shame, fear and amendment. But to heighten cruelty by wantonness, to render it more pungent by insult, are such exorbitances, as seldom disgrace the records of mankind. But whenever such instances occur, they strikingly ve|rify that eternal truth recorded in the House of Lords&mdash;<Q>it is much easier to restrain <HI>liberty</HI> from run|ning <HI>into licenciousness</HI> than POWER from swelling into <HI>tyranny and oppression.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Vol. Lord's Prot. Edit. 1767. p. 141. Anno 1736.</NOTE> Can it add dignity to this noble sentiment, or weight to this important truth, to say, that among the illustrious personages who subscribed it with their hands and transmitted it to posterity, we find a "Chesterfield" and "Cob|bam", a "Strafford" and a "Bathurst" a "Haver|sham" and "Gower"?</P>
<P>But to return. Are popular commotions pecu|liar to Boston? Hath not every maritime town in England been repeatedly affected by them? Are they not incident to every commercial and popular city?&mdash;whence, then, is it, that BOSTON is devoted to such unexampled treatment? But it may be said, Boston, <HI>as a town,</HI> hath aided, abeted, and participated in these tumults. Where is the evidence of it? I presume the King, Lords and Com|mons of Great-Britain had none; for they do not <HI>suggest it:</HI> I presume they did not believe it, be|cause they have not <HI>intimated it.</HI> And had they
<PB N="9" REF="013561_0010_0F90FF0108D565F8">
been furnished with such evidence, had they be|lieved the fact, surely it is an imputation unworthy of their dignity, to say, that they would not have given <HI>that matter</HI> in <HI>the preamble</HI> of the statute, as the ground of their extraordinary proceedure. <HI>But the records of Boston, and known facts prove that the inha|bitants discountenanced</HI> and <HI>disavowed all riot</HI> and disor|der. I am thus warranted in saying, that the <HI>mere occur|rences</HI> expressed in the act, is that matter which the British legislature have judged worthy the most un|parallelled penal severities. Whether <HI>this judgment</HI> be <HI>right,</HI> is a subject interesting to a citizen of the town to enquire; it is a subject on which <HI>a man</HI> will speak feelingly; on which AN ENGLISHMAN <HI>will</HI> speak <HI>freely</HI> and <HI>openly.</HI></P>
<P>Previous to further observations, it may be neces|sary to say, that the town of Boston had as <HI>a town cautiously</HI> and <HI>wisely</HI> conducted, not only without tumult, but with studied regard to established law. This the rolls of the town verify, and a hundred witnesses can confirm.</P>
<P>At the last town-meeting relative to the East|India tea and it's consignees, it was largely debated, whether it should be an instruction to the commit|tee, who were appointed to wait on those Gentle|men, <HI>to insist</HI> on their <HI>preremptory</HI> answer;&mdash;Whe|ther <HI>they would send back the Tea:</HI> and after long debate on the question, it passed by a very large majority in the <HI>negative.</HI> And the great|est enemy of the country cannot point out any one step of <HI>the Town of Boston,</HI> in the progress of this matter, that was tumultuous, disorderly and against law. This also is an additional reason, why we must conclude that the <HI>mere temporary events which
<PB N="10" REF="013561_0011_0F90FF0287178188">
took place in Boston,</HI> without any <HI>illegal</HI> proceedure of the town, in the matter of the tea, is in the judgment of the British senate an adequate foun|dation for the last act received from that powerful body.</P>
<P>The first enacting clause of the statute now in view, annihilates all commercial transactions within two certain points of the harbour of Boston, upon pain of the FORFEITURE of <Q>goods, wares and merchandize, and of boat, lighter, ship, vessel, or other bottom;&mdash;and of the guns, ammunition, tackle, furniture and stores, in or belonging to the same:</Q> <Q>and of any barge, hoy, lighter, wherry, or boat into which any goods &amp;c. are laden,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The next paragraph, <Q>in case any wharfinger, &amp;c. or any of their servants shall take up or land, or knowingly <HI>suffer</HI> to be taken up or landed, or shall ship off, or <HI>suffer</HI> to be water-born, at or from any of their said wharves, &amp;c. goods &amp;c.</Q> enacts a FORFEITURE and LOSS of such <Q><HI>goods</HI> &amp;c. and TREBLE the value thereof, to be computed, at the <HI>highest</HI> price of such sort of goods, &amp;c. toge|ther with the vessels and boats, and all the hor|ses, cattle, and carriages, whatsoever made use of in the shipping, unshipping, landing, remo|ving, carriage, or conveyance of any of the afore|said goods.</Q> &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P>The next clause provides, <Q>that if any ship &amp;<HI>c.</HI> shall be moored or lie at anchor, or be seen hover|ing within said bay, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> or within one league from the said bay, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> it shall and may be lawful for any Admiral, or <HI>commissioned</HI> officer of his Majesty's fleet or ships of war, or for ANY OFFI|CER
<PB N="11" REF="013561_0012_0F90FF032656CDD8">
OF HIS MAJESTY'S CUSTOMS, to <HI>compel</HI> such ship or vessel to depart to SOME OTHER port or harbour, or to SUCH STATION AS THE SAID OF|FICER SHALL APPOINT and to use SUCH FORCE for that purpose as shall be found necessary: And if such ship or vessel shall not depart ac|cordingly, WITHIN SIX HOURS <HI>after notice</HI> for that purpose given by <HI>such person</HI> as aforesaid, <HI>such ship or vessel, together with all the goods laden on board thereon, and all the guns, ammunition, tackle and furniture shall be forfeited and lost,</HI> WHETHER BULK SHALL HAVE BEEN BROKEN OR NOT.</Q></P>
<P>Let us here pause for a moment;&mdash;let us give time for one single reflection; let us give space for one pulse of the veins&mdash;one emotion of the heart. And who can think, but those exalted characters and that generous prince, stiled THE FATHER OF all HIS PEOPLE&mdash;who united to this terrible act had many reflections, many feelings of humanity, while they were solemnly consigning thousands&mdash;if not millions&mdash;to ruin, misery and desperation?</P>
<P>The persons in whom this authority is vested, are not confined to the ports or harbours <HI>on this continent:</HI> the vessel and cargo may be ordered to what harbour, port or station of the whole world, <HI>the officer</HI> pleases&mdash;if he appoint a <HI>continental</HI> station, 'tis grace and favour;&mdash;and what may be the price of that purchase, who can tell! what scope for ma|lice and ill-will; for pride and haughtiness; for avarice and power to wanton and insult, till the one is satiated and the other wearied!</P>
<P>Who are the persons to whom such unbounded, such enormous power is entrusted? Power is
<PB N="12" REF="013561_0013_0F90FF03EDC39768">
known to be intoxicating in it's nature, and in pro|portion to it's extent, is ever prone to wantoness: power and authority, says Plutarch, awaken every passion, and discover every <HI>latent</HI> vice:&mdash;what a co|gent temptation is here placed to insnare the most virtuous? But if there be one depraved passion in the bosom, as power gives scope and opportunity, how soon will it be called forth into licentious ex|ercise? Shall I be thought going too far; shall I trespass upon the bounds of truth and decency, if I say, that SOME of his Majesty's <HI>commissioned</HI> officers, in his fleet, or ships of war; SOME officers of his <HI>cus|toms</HI> are <HI>not altogether</HI> worthy of such high confidence and trust? Are there not <HI>inferior commissioned officers</HI> in the King's ships; are there not <HI>many</HI> of the LOW|ER officers of the customs, who have neither strength of understanding or integrity of heart to weild such a mighty power? Nay, may not I add, that SOME FEW (into whose hands peradventure the estate of <HI>a good</HI> subject and <HI>opulent</HI> merchant may chance to fall) are destitute of all sense, <HI>mental</HI> and <HI>humane?</HI> While contemplating this subject,&mdash;while the mind is active, and heart warm&mdash;how apt are we to for|get, that the illustrious Houses, who gave their sanction to this astonishing law, are dignified as learned and venerable;&mdash;and the Prince that gave his <HI>fiat,</HI> denominated&mdash;"THE WISEST AND BEST OF KINGS"?</P>
<P>Deelining an entrance upon matters heretofore discussed by abler heads, I have omitted all obser|vation on the <HI>right</HI> and <HI>policy</HI> of the claims and laws of Great-Britain over the colonies; upon the same principle, I waive entering that copious field which is presented, by that part of the present act, which provides for the recovery of all forfeitures and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the courts of admiralty&mdash;whose extended
<PB N="13" REF="013561_0014_0F90FF04A2677EC0">
jurisdiction hath been matter of very great grievance, heart-burnings and complaint; whose judges hold their commissions <HI>by the tenure of will and pleasure;</HI> and whose large salaries are a most powerful incentive to the desire of&mdash;<HI>well-pleasing</HI> ALL <HI>on whom they depend.</HI></P>
<P>Another passage in this statute makes <HI>utterly void</HI> ALL CONTRACTS, <Q>for consigning, shipping, or carrying any goods, &amp;c. <HI>to</HI> or <HI>from</HI> the har|bour of Boston, <HI>which</HI> HAVE BEEN <HI>made</HI> or entered into, or which shall be made or entered into, so long as the act continues in force, rela|ting to any ship which shall arrive at said town or harbour after the first day of June.</Q></P>
<P>Jurisprudents and the sages of the law for cen|turies have taught, that <HI>retrospective</HI> or <HI>post facto</HI> sta|tutes, were not only militant with the principles of found morals, but those also of political wisdom. But the Parliament, who by the bold figure of com|mon lawers, are stiled <HI>omnipotent,</HI> here <HI>enforces</HI> a different doctrine. The english colonist, replete with loyalty to his sovereign; the descendant from Britain, animated by love for a mother-country, represses the excursions of his understanding and passions: but the subject or native of another state will feel no such restraint. <HI>He</HI> has <HI>contracted</HI> to send his merchandize to this port, expects his returns in the commodities of the country&mdash;in compliance with his obligations, his treasures are moving with hazard upon the ocean, with hopes warm for gain. The ship (in which peradven|ture he hath risqued his life as well as fortune) after many a toil and jeopardy, reaches the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> port. But how are his hopes baffled&mdash;how will be
<PB N="14" REF="013561_0015_0F90FF0665EC2CF8">
rage and exclaim? vast hath been his expences to prepare for his adventure, and equally great his expectations from the Boston merchant. What guilt hath he contracted, what crime hath <HI>he</HI> com|mitted, that <HI>he also</HI> should be involved in the ca|lamitous consequences of this unexampled statute? Bouyed up for a moment, perhaps, with a vain expectation, that he may have a remedy on his <HI>contract against the merchant here;</HI>&mdash;how will this supposed foreigner sink with a ten-fold despondency, how will <HI>be</HI> rise again with adequate indignation, when he discovers all remedy gone;&mdash;his contract declared <HI>by the law, "utterly void,</HI> to ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES WHATSOEVER?"&mdash;Here again, love for a <HI>parent-</HI>country, love for a <HI>parent-</HI>king checks the current of reason, and restrains the career of passion.</P>
<P>Having taken this view, before we proceed fur|ther, it is natural once more to ask, whence arose this extraordinary stride of legislation; what is it, that <HI>the town</HI> of Boston hath done? what new and unheard of crime have the inhabitants committed to justify enacting of such disabilities, forfei|tures, pains and penalties? punishments that descend <HI>indiscriminately on all</HI> ought to have the sanction of <HI>unerring wisdom, and almighty power,</HI> or it will be questioned, if not opposed:&mdash;The present ven|geance falls <HI>indiscriminately</HI> on the <HI>acknowledged inno|cent,</HI> as well as the <HI>supposed guilty.</HI> Surely the evil is of a very malignant and terrible nature that can require such an extraordinary remedy. Admit for a moment, that the inhabitants of Boston were charged as high criminals; the highest criminals are not punishable, till arraigned before disinterested
<PB N="15" REF="013561_0016_0F90FF06E11A6168">
judges, heard in defence, and found guilty of the charge. But so far from all this, a whole people are accused, prosecuted by they know not <HI>whom;</HI> tried they know not <HI>when;</HI> proved guilty they know not <HI>how;</HI> and sentenced in a mode, which for number of calamities, extent and duration of severity, exceeds the annals of past ages, and we presume, in pity to mankind, will not mark any future AEra in the story of the world.</P>
<P>What will be the <HI>real</HI> consequences of this asto|nishing measure, and what those <HI>intended and expec|ted by</HI> the <HI>planners</HI> of it are very <HI>different</HI> considera|tions. A MACHIAVEL may plan, and his schemes prove abortive; and ALVA may be sent to execute, and his army be defeated. The circle of the arts and sciences, like the ball of empire, hath held a <HI>western</HI> course. From Chaldea and Egypt to Greece and Rome, soon after in Italy, and thence to the <HI>western</HI> provinces of Europe. Chaldea and Egypt had their Magi, their law-givers and heroes, when Greece and Rome swarmed with petty feu|datories and barbarians; Greece and Rome flouri|shed in literature, when Gaul, Germany, and Britain were uncivilized, rude and ignorant.

<P>There are other parts of the act now before us, which merit notice: particularly that, relative to the prosecution of suits in the ordinary courts of law, "for any thing done in pursuance of the act"; by which the defendant is enable <Q>to plead the general issue, and give the act, and the general matter, in evidence</Q>: whereupon it follows, that "if it <HI>shall appear</HI> so to have been done, the jury SHALL find for the defendant"; who, by an after clause, is to "recover <HI>treble</HI> costs".

The nobles thus, driven to desperate resolutions by the Cardinal's military movements, at a personal interview were warm and intemperate.

<P>A large army and revenue are not easily and at once forced upon a free people. By flow de|grees and plausible pretences, as we have seen in England, the end is accomplished.

<P>Yet <HI>in full peace</HI> without any just apprehensions of insurrections at home or invasions from abroad, it was the mischievous policy of the English mini|stry, in 1717, to procure an allowance of near dou|ble the forces to what had ever before been esta|blished by the sanction of parliament in times of public tranquillity.

<P><Q>Randolph, who, the people of New England said, went up and down seeking to devour them,</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hutch: hist. p. 319.</NOTE> was the next active emisary against the province. <Q>He was incessant and <HI>open</HI> in endeavour|ing the alteration of the constitution.</Q> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ib. 335,6</NOTE> In his open enmity, he appears far less odious; than those who have been equally inimical and equally indefatigable to the <HI>same purpose,</HI> with more cowardice, dissimulation, and

hypocrisy. Eight voyages were made across the Atlantic in the course of nine years by this invete|rate spirit, with hostile intentions to the govern|ment. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hutch: hist. 329.</NOTE> Nor will it be surprising to find him thus expose his life upon the ocean, when such services acquired "new powers". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. 329.</NOTE> Have we not seen in our own day, a similar policy adopted, and the same object operating as a motive to the like execrable conduct? Such has been the strange, tho' unhappily consistent, conduct of our mother-coun|try, that she has laid temptations and given rewards and stipends to those who have slandered and be|trayed her own children. Incited probably by the same motive. Cranfield rose up as in league with Randolph, and "infaniously represented the co|lony as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">gties and rebells." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. 337.</NOTE></P>
<P>Libels and conspiracies of this nature called for the interposition of authority: express laws were enacted for the prevention of like treasonable practices for the future and death being deemed the proper punishment for an enemy to his country, traitors to the constitution were to suffer that pen|alty. Thus a <Q><HI>conspiracy</HI> to invade the common|wealth, or <HI>any treacherous attempt to alter and sub|vert fundamentally the frame of policy and govern|ment was made a capital offence.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">ib 442. See p. 295, 336.</NOTE> Did our laws now contain a like provision, public conspirators and elevated parricides would tremble for their heads, who do not shudder at the enormity of their crimes. There are characters in society to devoid of virtue and endued with ferocity, that nothing

but sanguinary laws can restrain their wickedness. Even the distress and cries of their <HI>native</HI> country excite no compassion: reverence for fathers and affection for children cause no reluctance at mea|sures which stain the glorious lineage of their ancestors with infamy, and blast their spreading progeny with oppression.&mdash;that emanation from the Deity which creates them intelligents, seems to cease it's operation, and the tremendous idea of a GOD and futurity, excites neither repentance or reformation.</P>
<P>Thus may countrymen, from the days of Gardi|ner and Moreton, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hutch: hist. 31,2. Anno 1632.</NOTE> Gorges and Mason, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. 51. Anno 1636.</NOTE> Ran|dolph and Cranfield <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. 337. And Collect of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> papers, &amp;c. p. 477. &amp;c.</NOTE> down to the present day, the inhabitants of this Northern region have constantly been in danger and troubles from foes open and secret, abroad and in their bosom. Our freedom has been the object of envy, and <HI>to make void the charter of our Liberties</HI> the work and labor of an undimin|ished race of villains. One cabal having failed of success, new conspirators have rose, and what the first, could not make "void", the next "humbly desired to revoke." <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ib. 31. 2. 5.</NOTE> To this purpose one falshood after another hath been fabricated and spread abroad with equal turpitude and equal effrontery. That minute detail which would present actors now on the stage is the province of HISTORY:&mdash;She, inexora|bly severe towards the eminently guilty, will deline|ate their characters with the point of a diamond:&mdash;and <HI>thus blazoned in the face of day,</HI> the abhorrence and execrations of mankind will consign them to an infamous immortality.

So great has been the credulity of the British Court, from the beginning, or such hath been the activity of false brethren, that no tale inimical to the Northern Colonies, however false or absurd, but what hath found credit with administration, and operated to the prejudice of the Country. Thus it was told, and believed in England, that we were not in earnest in the expedition against Canada at the beginning of this century, and that the country did <HI>every thing in its power to defeat the success of it, and that the misfortune of that attempt ought to be wholly attributed to the northern colonies.</HI> While nothing could be more obvious, than that New-England had exhausted her <HI>youngest</HI> blood and all her treasures in the undertaking; and that every motive of self-preservation, happiness and safety must have ope|rated to excite these provinces to the most spirited and persevering measures against Canada. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Jer. Dummers Letter to a Noble Lord Edit. 1712. p. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 13 &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>The people who are attacked by bad men have a testimony of their merit, as the constitution which is invaded by powerful men, hath an evi|dence of it's value. The path of our duty needs no minute delineation:&mdash;it lies level to the eye. Let us apply then, like men sensible of it's impor|tance and determined on it's fulfillment. The in|roads upon our public liberty call for reparation: The wrongs we have sustained call for&mdash;justice. That reparation and that justice may yet be ob|tained by union, spirit and firmness. But to di|vide and conquer was the maxim of the Devil in the garden of Eden&mdash;and to disunite and inslave hath been the principle of all <HI>his</HI> votaries from that

period to the present. The crimes of the guilty are to them the cords of association, and dread of punishment, the indissoluble bond of union. The combinations, of publick robbers ought, therefore, to cement patriots and heroes: and as <HI>the former</HI> plot, and conspire to undermine and destroy the common-wealth, <HI>the latter</HI> ought to form a com|pact for opposition&mdash;a band of vengeance.</P>
<P>What insidious arts, and what deteitable practi|ces have been used to deceive, disunite and enslave the good people of this Continent? The mystical appellations of loyalty and allegiance, the venera|ble names of government and good order, and the sacred ones of piety and public virtue have been alternately prostituted to that abominable purpose. All the windings and guises, subterfuges and doublings, of which the human soul is susceptible, have been displayed on the occasion. But secrets which were thought impenetrable are no longer hid; characters deeply disguised are openly re|vealed: the discovery of gross impostors hath gen|erally pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ceeded, but a short time, their utter extir|pation.</P>
<P>Be not again, my country men, <Q>EASILY <HI>capti|vated with the appearances</HI> ONLY <HI>of wisdom and piety&mdash;professions</HI> of a regard to liberty and of a strong attachment to the publick interest.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hutch: hist. 1 vol. p. 53.</NOTE> Your fathers have been explicitly charged with this folly by one of their posterity. Avoid this and all <HI>similar errors.</HI> Be cautious against the deception of ap|pearances. <HI>By their fruits ye shall know them,</HI> was the saying of ONE who perfectly knew the hu|man heart. Judge of affairs which concern <HI>social</HI> happiness <HI>by facts:</HI>&mdash;Judge of man <HI>by his deeds.</HI> For it is very certain, that pious zeal <HI>for days and times,</HI> for
<PB N="80" REF="013561_0081_0F90FF4658822798.">
mint and cummin hath, often, been pretended by those who were infidels at bottom; and it is as cer|tain, that <HI>attachment to the dignity of Government, and the King's service,</HI> hath often flowed from the mouths of men who harboured the darkest ma|chinations against <HI>the true end of the former,</HI> and were destitute of every right principle of loyalty <HI>to the latter.</HI> Hence then, care and circumspection are necessary branches of political duty. And as <Q>it is <HI>much easier</HI> to restrain liberty from run|ning into licentiousness, than power from swell|ing into tyranny and oppression,</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 vol. Lords Prot. p. 141. Anno 1736.</NOTE> so much more caution and resistance are required against the over-bearing of rulers, than the extravagance of the people.</P>
<P>To give no more authority to any order of state and to place no greater public confidence in any man, than is necessary for the general wellfare, may be considered by the people as an important point of policy. But though craft and hypocrisy are prevalent, yet piety and virtue have a real existence: duplicity and political imposture abound, yet bene|volence and public spirit are not altogether banished the world. As wolves will appear in sheep's-cloath|ing, so superlative knaves and parricides will assume the vesture of the man of virtue and patriotism.</P>
<P>These things are permitted BY PROVIDENCE, no doubt, for wise and good reasons. Man was cre|ated a rational, and was designed for an active be|ing. His faculties of intelligence and force were given him for use. When the wolf, therefore, is found devouring the flock, no hierarchy forbids a seisure of the victim for sacrifice; so also, when
<PB N="81" REF="013561_0082_0F90FF472635A590">
dignified impostors are caught destroying those, whom their arts deceived and their stations destined them to protect,&mdash;the sabre of justice flashes right|eousness at the stroke of execution.</P>
<P>Yet be not amused, my Countrymen!&mdash;the ex|tirpation of bondage, and the reestablishment of freedom are not of easy acquisition. The worst passions of the human heart, and the most subtle pro|jects of the human mind are leagued against you; and principalities and power have acceded to the combination. Trials and conflicts you must, there|fore, endure;&mdash;hazards and jeopardies&mdash;of life and fortune&mdash;will attend the struggle. Such is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of all noble exertions for public liberty and social happiness.&mdash;Enter not the lists without thought and consideration, left you arm with timidity and com|bat with irresolution. Having engaged in the con|flict, let nothing discourage your vigour, or re|pel your perseverance:&mdash;Remember, that submissi|on to the yoke of bondage is the worst that can befall a people after the most fierce and unsuccessful resistance. What can the misfortune of vanquish|ment take away, which despotism and rapine would spare? It had been <HI>easy</HI> (said the great law-giver Solon to the Athenians,) <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plut: Life of Solon.</NOTE> to repress <HI>the advances</HI> of tyranny, and prevent it's establishment, <HI>but now it is established and grown to some height</HI> it would be MORE GLORIOUS <HI>to demolish it.</HI> But nothing glori|ous is accomplished, nothing great is attained, no|thing valuable is secured without magnanimity of mind and <HI>devotion of heart to the service.</HI>&mdash;BRUTUS|LIKE, therefore, dedicate yourselves at this day to to the service of your Country; and henceforth live A LIFE OF LIBERTY AND GLORY.&mdash;<Q>On the

<P>Inspired with public virtue, touched with the wrongs and indignant at the insults offered his Country, the high-spirited Cassius exhibits an he|roic example:&mdash;"Resolved as we are", (replied the hero to his friend) <Q>resolved as we are, let us march against the enemy, for <HI>tho' we should not conquer, we have nothing to fear</HI></Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plut.
