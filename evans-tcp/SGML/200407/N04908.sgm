<P>LIBERTY and Property, the Love of our Country, Truth and Disinterestedness, are most unhappily be|come only meer Sounds and Words of Course, and now seldom mean more than our common compli|mentary <HI>Cant,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>&mdash;Your most humble Servant, I am exceeding glad, or exceeding sorry for you, &amp;C.&mdash;in which Lip <HI>Service</HI> there is perhaps seldom one Word of Truth and Sin|cerity. And as most People love to be in the <HI>Fashion,</HI> and seeing it is now very <HI>unfashionable</HI> to be guilty of speaking the Truth (especially where <HI>Interest</HI> is concerned) and conforming our <HI>Acti|ons thereunto;</HI> so now there are many among us, who from some secret Self Love disguise the Truth, and basely act now, as did <HI>Pilot</HI> of old, who asked by Way of Jest, "<HI>What</HI> is Truth? and immediately fled from an Answer: And altho' the Truth may not with Propriety be spoken at all Times, yet <HI>there is the fit Time</HI> when it should be spoken; and then it is <HI>criminal</HI> to with-hold one's Peace; and as Truth is Light which dispels Darkness, so when Clouds and Darkness surround us, and im|minent Danger hangeth over our Heads, then how good is it to have Truth break out upon us in a Flood of Day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we may be indulg'd the Expression)&mdash;Darkness was perhaps never more thick and gloomy than at this Day.

And as Party, Interest, the insatiable Love of Money, are ever the most violent Enemies to Truth, Liberty, and the universal Love of one's Country; so wherever these are pre|dominant and daily grow more powerful, they do forever en|deavour to the utmost of their Skill and Strength, right or wrong, to warp and bend every Thing, however unjust, unsociable and selfish, to say in, fix and strengthen <HI>that Side, or Party they are of,</HI> however opposite, detrimental, and pernicious it may prove in its Consequences, to the whole Community, to their Country, either row, or hereafter: And the greater and more powerful the Party, and the greater the <HI>Interest</HI> to uphold and carry it on, consequently the greater must be the real <HI>Damage</HI> done to all those against <HI>whom</HI> any such S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tt and Party of Men improve their Interest, and exert their Power.</P>
<P>Now, if these general <HI>Observations</HI> are true; it will we believe be readily granted that there is a great Deal of Reason, for e|very honest Man, at this critical Conjuncture of our Affairs of this Province, when Things are, we fear, <HI>ripening for our final Destruction and Overthrow,</HI> to stand up unterrified and unseduced, for the <HI>real Interest,</HI> Liberties and Properties of his Fellow-Ci|tizens, and for his dear Children, and his dearer Country.

<P>Experience has dearly and wofully taught us all, That <HI>nothing in the World will so powerfully set the Tongue, the Pen, the Wit, and Heart of most Men so earnestly, so vigorously to Work as IN|TEREST, either real or imaginary.</HI> This it was perhaps that sat the judicious Author to work to write and publish to the World that Piece in a late <HI>Independent Advertiser,</HI> No. 13. Mar. 28. wherein the good Author out of pure Zeal for Virtue and ar|dent Love to his Country, has dictated and prescribed the <HI>only Scheme</HI> (as he says) that can possibly have any direct and good Tendency to implant in us the moral Duties and Virtues; and really make us, a wise, pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ent, industrious, honest, yea a pros|perous and compleatly HAPPY PEOPLE&mdash;<Q>All which (accord|ing to this prodigious Genius) will be immediately consequent

<P>If this will hold good with Regard to the <HI>Political Hive,</HI> see|ing this is pretty much <HI>our</HI> impoverished Case, who are now so drained of our robust and able-bodied Labourers, the Conse|quence must be, that <HI>all our Difficulties don't necessarily arise meerly on Account of the great Emission of Paper Money.</HI> And in Case the <HI>Paper Money had not been made,</HI> by the publick Currency of which, we carried on the great Expedition against our potent and common Enemies, and happily (through divine Goodness) succeeded, we perhaps should have been in much <HI>worse Cir|cumstances.</HI></P>
<P>And, notwithstanding the mighty Bustle and Clamour, that has been by some cunning and selfish Men industriously raised and aggravated, about <HI>the Badness of the Money,</HI> yet we are ex|perimentally taught <HI>to know,</HI> that if the <HI>Articles of Life</HI> had been, or were now <HI>very plenty,</HI> they must, and would be <HI>cheap;</HI> and be sold very low <HI>even</HI> for our despised <HI>Paper-Money!</HI> This is also true with Regard to the Money itself, which even the M&mdash;themselves every Day are fully demonstrating to every one that hath Eyes to see, and Ears to hear; or else why are they so greedy after it, hoarding of it up to make it scarce, in Order to <HI>make it to them as good as so much SILVER.</HI> First they con|demn'd it, and <HI>them that</HI> made it, and jumpt a 100 <HI>per cent</HI> in the <HI>Principal,</HI> for every Article they parted with for it; altho' they were for the <HI>Expedition it self;</HI> then settled their Books and Accounts, fixt them at <HI>Silver</HI> from 26 <HI>s.</HI> 8. <HI>d.</HI> to about 30 <HI>s.</HI> per
