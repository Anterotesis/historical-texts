<P>A Man of Piety and Ingenuity, as well as of consi|derable Reading, having read Mr. <HI>Stennet,</HI> and some other of the <HI>Antipaedobaptist</HI> Authors, was brought under great Difficulty and Confusion of Mind, with Respect to the Validity of his Baptism; which gave Occasion to the following Conference between his Mi|nister and him.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good-morrow Neighbour: I am heartily glad to see you. I have for some Time wanted an Op|portunity of Conversation with you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Neighbour.</SPEAKER>
<P>I conclude, Sir, that I know the Reason of your Desire of Conversation with me, having heard something of it before; I am now come on Purpose to give you an Opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min. </SPEAKER>
<P>I am informed that you are inclined to the Errors of the <HI>Antipaedohaptists;</HI> that you are upon the Point of joining their Party; and of being dipt by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure, if I know my own Heart, I am not inclined to embrace any Error; nor should I have the least Disposition to join the <HI>Baptists,</HI> could I be con|vinced, that they are in an Error.&mdash;But if you'll allow me to deal freely with you, I must tell you, that the Case at present appears to me in a quite contrary Light. I am afraid I have hitherto been bred up in Error, have never yet complied with our blessed Saviour's Institution, but remain <HI>unbaptized</HI> to this Day; and you can't wonder that this Thought is productive of very great Anxiety of Mind.</P>

<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider, I entreat you, that it is not a small Matter to renounce your <HI>Baptism,</HI> whereby you were in your Infancy dedicated to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; to renounce all the other Ordinances of the Gospel, as the Ministry of the Word, and the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which you have been so frequent|ly favoured with; as you will practically do, if you act up to the Principles which you now espouse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir, is my doubting of the Validity of my <HI>Infant Baptism,</HI> a renouncing of it? And how is it a renouncing the other Gospel Ordinances which I have enjoy'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were in your early Infancy, in the most solemn Manner dedicated to the sacred Trinity; you either acknowledge your self devoted to God by that solemn Transaction, and under the Bonds of that Cove|nant, which you were then brought into, or you do not: If you do acknowledge this, you can have no just Concern about any other <HI>Baptism,</HI> being already devoted to God, and brought into Covenant with him by that holy Ordi|nance. If you do not acknowledge this, you renounce your <HI>Baptism,</HI> you vacate the Covenant between God and you, by disowning that Relation to the glorious God, which you were brought into by <HI>Baptism.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Thought is new to me; I shall endea|vour to consider it, and I hope it will have its proper Weight with me: But if this Reasoning be allowed to be just, I don't see how my seeking <HI>Baptism</HI> in the Method proposed, is a renouncing the other Ordinances of the Gospel, such as the Ministry of the Word, and the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; since I acknow|ledge these to have been regularly administred, tho' I suppose my <HI>Infant Baptism</HI> to be a Nullity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are <HI>unbaptized,</HI> you are as to your external and visible Relation, <HI>a Stranger to the Covenants

of Promise;</HI> and this is not your Case only, but (upon the Principles you espouse) it is also the Case of those of us, who have been the Dispensers of the Mysteries of the Gospel to you; upon your Principles it therefore follows, that we of the Ministry being <HI>unbaptized,</HI> are not in Covenant with God, are not so much as visible Christians, and consequently cannot be Ministers before we are Members of the Christian Church: And how then can we have any Right to administer sacred Ordinances?&mdash;And as for you, what Right can you have to com|memorate that Relation to Christ which you have never sustain'd, to seal that Covenant wherein you have no Gospel Interest? as you must do, if you partake of the Lord's Supper, whilst unbaptized.&mdash;That in whatever View you consider this Case, it will appear, that all the publick Ordinances of the Gospel you have been privileged with, and been a Partaker of, are just so much a Nullity as your <HI>Baptism,</HI>&amp; by rejecting, that, you reject them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have (I trust) experienced so much comfor|table Communion &amp; Fellowship with God, in the Ministry of the Word, and in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, that I dare not renounce them; and were I convinced of the Truth of what you have offered, and which I don't at present know how to answer, it would throw me into very great Confusion, but would not free me from my pre|sent Difficulties, with Respect to the Subjects and Mode of <HI>Baptism.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I shall be capable to offer you full Mat|ter of Satisfaction upon those Points, before our Con|versation ends; but it cannot be improper to put you in Mind, that the whole Church of Christ for many Cen|turies together, practised Infant Baptism; that you your self was baptized in your Infancy, and were brought up in the Enjoyment of Gospel Ordinances, dispensed by <HI>one</HI> who was likewise baptized in Infancy; and there|fore
<PB N="6" REF="005759_0005_0000000000000000">
greatly concerns you, to consider what Con|tempt you cast upon the great Head of the Church, to suppose that he has for so long a Time, wholly deserted all the Churches upon Earth, &amp; left them without a Ministry, without Ordinances, and therefore without the instituted Means of Life and Salvation.&mdash;It concerns you also, seriously to consider, how uncharitably you offend against all the Generation of God's Children, to represent the whole Church for so many hundreds of Years, and very much the greatest Part of it at present, to be in a State of Heathenism, without any Hope of Salvation, but from the uncovenanted Mercies of God.&mdash;It concerns you to consider, what Indignity you offer to the blessed Spirit, by practically denying all his divine Influences in and by his Ordinances, whereby he has so eminently acknow|ledged those Institutions, and improved them for the Conversion and Edification of such Multitudes of precious Souls.&mdash;It likewise concerns you, solemnly to consider, how you may expect that God will resent your Renun|ciation of your <HI>Covenant Relation</HI> to him, and of all the publick Ordinances of Salvation, which you have Cause with so much Thankfulness to acknowledge and improve.&mdash;And I will only add, that it concerns you also seriously to consider, how it can be, that the blessed Saviour has fulfilled his Promise, that he would be with his Mini|sters in the Administration of <HI>Baptism</HI> to the End of the World: Or how it is possible there should be any <HI>Baptism</HI> at all in the World at this Time, either among the <HI>Paedobaptists</HI> or <HI>Antipaedobaptists,</HI> upon the Principles which you espouse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am pretty much surprized by the former of those Consequences which you have represented; I confess, I don't know how to evade or answer them; but the last appears not only new, but without any manner of Foundation.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="005759_0006_0000000000000000">
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! Let us consider that Case something particularly, and see whether that Consequence won't force it self upon you.&mdash;Don't you acknowledge that <HI>Infant Baptism</HI> did universally obtain in the Church, even from the Apostles Times?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! by no Means! Could that be prov'd, the Controversy would be quickly brought to an End.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>At what Time do you suppose <HI>Infant Baptism</HI> did first universally obtain in the Church?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't pretend to be read in Church History; but the Authors whom I have read upon this Subject, don't suppose this to have happen'd earlier than between three or four hundred Years after Christ's Nativity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had you read the Authors on the other Side of the Question, you would have found undoubted Evidence from the ancient Fathers, that <HI>Infant Bap|tism</HI> constantly obtain'd in the truly primitive Church; but I need not insist upon this; let it be supposed to be as late as your Authors imagine, before this Practice of baptizing Infants universally obtain'd; you must upon that Supposition allow, that there was more than eleven hundred Years, in which the whole Christian Church came into the united and constant Practice of baptizing Infants; you can't pretend that this Practice was called in Question, or made Matter of Debate in the Church, till the Madmen of <HI>Munster,</HI> who were the Scandal of the Reformation, set themselves against this Practice as well as against the other Ordinances of the Gospel.&mdash;You must therefore allow, that from the fourth Century to the sixteenth, is more then eleven hundred Years;&mdash;Now during this long Period, what became of our blessed Saviour's Promise, to be with his Ministers <HI>always,</HI> in the Administration of this Ordinance?&mdash;I now demand of you an Answer (if any can be given) to this Question; Was our blessed Lord with his Ministers in the
<PB N="8" REF="005759_0007_0000000000000000">
Administration of <HI>Baptism</HI> during this Period, or was he not? If you answer in the Affirmative, you acknow|ledge <HI>Infant Baptism</HI> to be his own Institution; if you answer in the Negative, you call his Veracity and Faithfulness into Question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not prepared to answer your Question; there appears a Difficulty in it, that I don't at present see how to get over; but however this Case be, I can't imagine how you draw your Consequence from hence, that there can be no <HI>Baptism</HI> now in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think an unbaptized Person can be qualified for the sacred Ministry, or be fit to administer <HI>Baptism</HI> to others?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I believe not; it seems necessary that they should be at least visible Christians themselves, before they can have either Right or Authority to act in the Name of Christ, in bringing others into his Family, vesting them with his Name and Livery, and introducing them into a Covenant-Relation to Christ, and into the Character and Privileges of his Disciples.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! How came the Madmen of <HI>Munster;</HI> how came the first <HI>Antipaedobaptists</HI>in <HI>England,</HI> by their <HI>Baptism?</HI> Had these any other <HI>Baptism</HI> than what they received in their Infancy? If not, (as it is certain they had not) it must follow, that either <HI>Infant Baptism</HI> is the Ordinance of Christ, or they could not have a Right to administer that Ordinance to others, which they had not received themselves; the Administration therefore (ac|cording to your own Principles) must be a Nullity in the Beginning, and consequently must continue a Nullity ever since.&mdash;The <HI>Baptism</HI> you pretend to, was (upon these Principles) first administred in <HI>England,</HI> by un|baptized Persons; by such as were not so much as visible Christians themselves; by such who could therefore have no Claim to the Gospel Ministry, nor any Right to ad|minister
<PB N="9" REF="005759_0008_0000000000000000">
sacred Ordinances; and consequently, the whole Succession of your Ministry from that Time, must re|main unbaptized Persons, and there can therefore be no <HI>Baptism</HI> among you, any more than among us, until there be a new Commission from Heaven to renew and restore this Ordinance, which is at present lost out of the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>There were doubtless some <HI>adult Baptisms</HI> in the Church in the Period you speak of, tho' <HI>Infant Baptism</HI> generally prevailed, as there are now amongst most of the Churches of your Persuasion; and therefore <HI>Baptism</HI> was not quite lost out of the World, as you express it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were that so, by whom were these adult Persons baptized? Was it not by such as were themselves baptized in Infancy?&mdash;And how therefore will this help your Case, unless you can prove a continued Suc|cession of <HI>adult Baptisms?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have heard, that the ancient <HI>Wal|denses</HI> were in the constant Practice of <HI>adult Baptism</HI> on|ly; and if so, it will wholly obviate all your Reasonings upon this Head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a mere Imagination, without any Foundation that I know of, &amp; is accordingly to be rejected as a groundless Figment; but were that allow'd to be true, how would that help the Case, with Respect to the English <HI>Antipaedobaptists?</HI> Did they descend from the ancient <HI>Waldenses?</HI> Did the first of this Profession receive their <HI>Baptisms</HI> from them? If not, (were this chimerical Imagination allowed to be Fact, yet) this new Sect must have been begun in <HI>England</HI> by unbaptized Persons, and consequently the whole Succession of their Churches must remain unbaptized till this Day, as I have shewn you before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, all this Conversation serves but to en|crease my Perplexity, and to throw new Difficulties in my Way; but in no wise relieves my Mind and Con|science
<PB N="10" REF="005759_0009_0000000000000000">
from the Distress I was under before;&mdash;this does not shew me a divine Institution for <HI>Infant Baptism.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt, you ha'n't well attended to the Evi|dence I have now set before you:&mdash;I have shewn you, that our blessed Saviour has promised to be with his Ministers in the Administration of Baptism, <HI>always, even to the End of the World.</HI> Mat. xxviii. 19, 20.&mdash;He is faithful, that gave us this promise, and it has certainly been fulfilled; but it has not been fulfilled in the constant Con|tinuance of <HI>adult Baptism,</HI> and therefore <HI>Infant Baptism</HI> must necessarily be his own Institution, in the Admini|stration of which, and of which only, he has always afforded his divine Presence with his Ministers, according to his graicous, Promise.&mdash;You dare not suppose the Promise violated, and therefore you must suppose <HI>Infant Baptism</HI> to be Christ's own Institution. I have besides shewn you, that <HI>Infant Baptism</HI> having obtain'd for so ma|ny Centuries in the whole Church or Christ, it must be the Ordinance of Christ, or there can be no <HI>Baptism</HI> in the World; and therefore you can gain Nothing by going over to the Party you have newly chosen, for <HI>Baptism,</HI> since they themselves are all (upon your Principles) un|baptized as well as we.&mdash;This appears to me sufficient for your Satisfaction, if there could be no other Argument offered for your Conviction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Reasoning does indeed perplex me, but it does not afford me such Satisfaction, as a plain Scripture Institution of <HI>Infant Baptism</HI> would do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you consider the Covenant of Grace, which was made with <HI>Abraham,</HI> and with all his Seed, both after the Flesh and after the Spirit; and by God's express Command to be sealed to Infants, you will there find a sufficient Scripture Institution for <HI>Infant Baptism;</HI>&mdash;you will find this Covenant in <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. 2, 4, 7, 10, 12. <HI>And I will make my Covenant between me and thee.&mdash;As 
<PB N="11" REF="005759_0010_0000000000000000">
for me, behold my Covenant is with thee; and thou shalt be a Father of many Nations,&mdash;And I will establish my Cove|nant between me and thee; and thy Seed after thee in their Generations, for an everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto thee and thy Seed after thee.&mdash;This is my Covenant which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy Seed after thee, every Man Child among you shall be circumised.&mdash;He that is eight Days old shall be circumcised among you.</HI> Here we are taught as plainly as Words can teach us, that this Cove|nant was made with <HI>Abraham,</HI> as he was the <HI>Father of many Nations,</HI> the Father of the Gentiles as well as Jews; that this Covenant was a Covenant of Grace, an <HI>Everlast|ing</HI> Covenant, a Covenant whereby the Lord is a God to <HI>Abraham</HI> and all his Seed after him; and that this Cove|nant was to be sealed to <HI>Infants,</HI> in their early Infancy, upon the eighth Day, which was as soon as any Creature was to be esteemed clean, after its Birth, and fit (by the Levitical Institution) to be offered to to the Lord. <HI>Exod.</HI> xxii. 30. <HI>Lev.</HI> xxii. 27. From all which it undoubtedly follows, that this Covenant was made with us, as the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> as well as with the Jews; he was the Father of the Believers in our Nation, as well as in theirs; and therefore the Obligations of it still remain upon us, to dedicate our Infants to the Lord, by sealing this Cove|nant to 'em as soon as possible.&mdash;This Argument was accordingly used by the Apostle with the first Christian Converts, as a Reason for their being baptized. <HI>Repent and be baptized every one of you: for the Promise is unto you and to your Children; and to all that are afar off, even to as many as the Lord our God shall call.</HI> Acts ii. 38, 39. The Promise was undoubtedly the Covenant made with <HI>Abra|ham;</HI> this Promise or Covenant was urged as a Reason why they ought to be baptized; this Covenant of Promise was also made with their Children, and was likewise at Reason why they ought to be baptized; this Covenant
<PB N="12" REF="005759_0011_0000000000000000">
of Promise was likewise made with the Gentiles, withthem that were then afar off, even with as many of them as the Lord our God shall ever call into a Church State; and is therefore a like Reason, why the Gentiles and their Children, when called into a Church State, should be also baptized.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Argument is (I confess) set in a stronger Light than I have before consider'd it; and yet I have sundry Objections against it, which I know not how to resolve; these I shall take Liberty distinctly to propose, that it may be seen whether any just Answer-can be given to them.&mdash;My first Objection is, that this Promise made with <HI>Abraham,</HI> seems to be no more than a Promise of Temporal Mercies; &amp; particularly of his inheriting the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> as an everlasting Possession to himself and his Seed after him; as appears from <HI>ver</HI>8 of that Chapter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>That this Covenant was a Covenant of Grace, and contained special spiritual Mercies in it, is abundantly evident from the Tenor of the Covenant it self.&mdash;It consists of two general Articles, which include all spi|ritual Blessings in them; the first is expressed in <HI>ver. 4. Behold my Covenant is with thee; and thou shalt be a Father of many Nations:</HI> The second is expressed in <HI>ver. 7. And I will establish my Covenant between me and thee; and thy Seed after thee in their Generations, for an everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy Seed after thee.</HI> Was the Promise of Christ's descending from <HI>Abraham's</HI> Loins; Was the Promise of the Gentile Nations being bro't into the Faith of Christ, &amp; thereby becoming the Seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> after the Spirit, no more than a Promise of Temporal Mercies? And yet this, you must allow, was immediately intended by the first Article of this Cove|nant.&mdash;Was the Promise that God would be <HI>Abraham's</HI> God, and the God of his Seed after him for ever (ac|cording to the second Article of this Covenant) no more 
<PB N="13" REF="005759_0012_0000000000000000">
than a Promise of Temporal Mercies? Are not all spiritual &amp; everlasting Blessings of every Kind, contained in this Promise? And does not the Apostle, with Refe|rence to this very Covenant, strongly assure us, that <HI>the Promise that he should be the Heir of the World</HI> (or the Father of many Nations) <HI>was not to</HI> Abraham <HI>or to his Seed thro' the Law: but thro' the Righteousness of Faith?</HI> Rom. iv. 13. And does he not also further instruct us, that <HI>to Abraham and his Seed were the Promises made. He faith not, and to Seeds, as of many: but as of one; and to thy Seed which is Christ.&mdash;And if we be in Christ, then are we Abraham's Seed; and Heirs according to the Pro|mise?</HI> Gal. iii. 16, 29. Does he not, when alluding to this very Covenant, likewise teach us, that the <HI>Blessing of Abraham is come unto the Gentiles thro' Jesus Christ, that we might receive the Promise of the Spirit thro' Faith.</HI> Ibid. ver. 14. And that <HI>we, as Isaac was, are the Children of the Promise.</HI> Gal. iv. 28. I hope by this Time you are convinced, that this Covenant contains in it something more than Temporal Mercies; and that it was truly the Covenant of Grace made with <HI>Abraham,</HI> on Behalf of himself and both his natural and spiritual Seed, both Jews and Gentiles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not expect such Evidence upon this Point, but yet Part of my Difficulty remains; you have not answered my Objection, that this Covenant was a Promise of the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> to <HI>Abraham</HI> and his Posterity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have fully answered it, by shewing you, that it was a Promise of Christ and Salvation by him; that it was a Promise made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and to all the believing <HI>Gentiles</HI> in him; and, in a Word, that it was the Covenant of Grace, that Covenant by which alone we can have any grounded Hope of Salvation: How then could it be a Promise of the Land of the <HI>Canaan</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="005759_0013_0000000000000000">
only? Is not this the most trifling Pretence in the World? Were not the Promises of this Covenant made to all <HI>Abraham's</HI> Seed, both natural and spiritual? And are the believing Gentiles Heirs of the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> according to this Promise?&mdash;Nay, were all his natural Seed Heirs of the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> by Vertue of this Promise, when not a fourth Part of them (none but the Posterity of his Grandson <HI>Jacob</HI>) ever possess'd it?&mdash;Was there no more imply'd in God's being a God to <HI>Abraham</HI> and to his Seed after him, than that they should inherit the Land of <HI>Canaan?</HI> One would think that no Man could seriously talk at this Rate.&mdash;Evident it is, that the Promise of the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was no Part of this Covenant; it was but an additional Article of divine Favour annexed to it: If <HI>Canaan,</HI> as here promised, be considered as typical of our heavenly Inheritance; yet a greater than <HI>Canaan</HI> is here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another Difficulty before me is, that if this Covenant be allow'd to be the Covenant of Grace, I can't see how it can be prov'd, that <HI>Circumcision</HI> was a Seal of that Covenant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>It can be prov'd from the express Words of the Apostle,<HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 11. <HI>And he received the Sign of Circum|cision, a Seal of the Righteousness of the Faith, which he had yet being uncircumcised.</HI>&mdash;It being the Sum of the Co|venant of Grace, that we are to be justified and saved by the Righteousness of Faith, where the Righteousness of Faith is sealed, the Covenant of Grace is sealed; this Text of the Apostle is therefore express &amp; full to the Purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This does (I acknowledge) seem to be full and plain Evidence, that <HI>Circumcision</HI> was a Seal of the Co|venant of Grace; But what is this to <HI>Baptism?</HI> If God has ordered the Covenant of Grace to be sealed to <HI>Abra|ham's</HI> Infant Seed by <HI>Circumcision,</HI> how does it appear, that he has required it to be sealed to our Infant Seed by <HI>Baptism?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="005759_0014_0000000000000000">
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>This also is evident, by most easy and natural Deductions from the Word of God, as well as by a just Consideration of the Nature and Reason of the Case. The Apostle teaches us, <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 27, 29. <HI>That as many as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.&mdash;And if we be Christ's, then are we Abraham's Seed, and Heirs accord|ing to the Promise.</HI> Now, how can our putting on Christ by <HI>Baptism</HI> make us <HI>Abraham's</HI> Seed, and Heirs accord|ing to this Promise and Covenant made with him, if <HI>Baptism</HI> be not now a Seal of that Covenant? I think you can't pretend to shew any other Way, in which this can possibly be; and if <HI>Baptism</HI> be now a Seal of that Covenant, it must be administred to such, unto whom that Covenant requires its Seal to be administred; that is, it must be administred to Infants in their early Infan|cy.&mdash;And if we consider the Text before cited, the same Consequence will necessarily follow.<HI>Repent and be baptized every one of you.&mdash;For the Promise is unto you and to your Children; and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</HI> Acts ii. 38, 39. That the Promise here mentioned, refer'd to the Covenant made with <HI>Abraham,</HI> is certain from this Consideration, that the Covenant with <HI>Abraham,</HI> and that only, was a Promise both to his natural Seed, and to those who were then <HI>afar off;</HI> that is, to those Gentile Nations, who shall be called into a Church State. It therefore follows, that if this Promise gives a Claim to <HI>Baptism,</HI> (as the ci|ted Text assures us that it does) then all are to be bap|tized who are the Subjects of this Promise; these, the quoted Text assures us, were adult Professors, and their Children; and these, the original Covenant or Promise assures us, were Infants in their early Infancy.&mdash;<HI>Can any Man then forbid Water, that these should not be baptized,</HI> who have received the Covenant of Promise as well as we?&mdash;And furthermore, what I would especially infer
<PB N="16" REF="005759_0015_0000000000000000">
from this Text is, that the Covenant of Promise made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> could not give a Claim to <HI>Baptism,</HI> and make it a Duty to be baptized, (as the Text teaches us that it does) if <HI>Baptism</HI> were not a Seal of that Covenant.&mdash;What Sense can possibly be made of the Apostle's Rea|soning, (<HI>Be baptized; for the Promise is unto you and your Children</HI>) if <HI>Baptism</HI> were not a Seal of that Promise? Consider you and see if you can find any other Reason than this only, why <HI>Baptism</HI> is enjoined on Account of our Interest in that Promise; if you can make no Sense of the Text in any other View of it, you must allow this to be its natural and necessary Meaning. This then is the Sum of the Matter: <HI>Circumcision</HI> is a Token or Seal of the Covenant of Grace. (<HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. 11. <HI>And it shall be a Token of the Covenant betwixt me and you)</HI> And it is al|lowed on all Hands, that <HI>Baptism</HI> is a Token or Seal of the Covenant of Grace; it therefore follows, that since this Ordinance is administred to the very self-same Ends that the other was, it should also be administred to the same Subjects.</P>

<P>I cannot, I confess, be fully satisfied with this Reasoning, since there appears this great Difference in the Case; <HI>Circumcision</HI> was by God's express Institution to be administred to Infants, but there is no such Insti|tution with Respect to <HI>Baptism;</HI> methinks our Lord Je|sus Christ would have given us some plain Direction in this Matter, if he had design'd <HI>infant Baptism</HI> as a stand|ing Ordinance in his Church.</P>

<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am now proving to you, that the very same Institution which requires <HI>Circumcision</HI> to be administred to Infants, requires <HI>Baptism</HI> to be also administred to In|fants, in that each of these Ordinances were appointed as a Seal of the very self-same Covenant, and there|fore there needed no new Declaration with respect to the Subjects of this Seal; this was sufficiently provid|ed
<PB N="17" REF="005759_0016_0000000000000000">
for by the original Institution.&mdash;To exemplify this to you, in a familiar Light: you hold your Lands by Patent made to your Grandfather, in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Second, and sealed with a red Seal; now should King <HI>George</HI> call in all the Patents granted in that Reign, to receive a new Confirmation, by annexing his great Seal to them in white Wax, would there be any Occa|sion for a written Declaration, that this Seal confirmed the Lands to you, and to your Children and Heirs, when that is express contain'd in the very Body of the origi|nal Patent, which is nothing altered, but has only received a new Confirmation by the Seal annexed to it? The Ap|plication of this to the present Case is most easy and fa|miliar: The Patent sealed by <HI>Baptism</HI> is (so to speak) the very same Parchment that was given to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and therefore necessarily contains all the same Privileges and Benefits, and makes these over to the same Subjects; there is nothing altered, but the Seal only; that was a red, this is a white Seal.&mdash;What Necessity can there there|fore be of an express Declaration, that this Covenant under the Gospel Dispensation should be sealed to Infants, when it is already so fully provided for, by the original Patent? I entreat you. however, to remember, that I don't speak this by Way of Concession, that there is no Direc|tion in the New-Testament for the baptizing Infants: I have shewn you the contrary already, and may have fur|ther Occasion to illustrate that Point; but what I have now offered, is to convince you, that were this really so, we have a sufficient Institution of <HI>Infant Baptism,</HI> from the <HI>Abrahamitical</HI> Covenant.</P>

<P>The <HI>Circumcision</HI> of Infants was indeed requir|ed by the Covenant made with <HI>Abraham;</HI> why is it not then continued now, if we are under the same Cove|nant? How comes <HI>Baptism</HI> to take Place of it, and to be administred by virtue of that Covenant which requir|ed <HI>Circumcision?</HI></P>

<P>Circumcision was a bloody Rite, and as such, was typical of the Blood of the great Sacrifice; and of Consequence must be abrogated upon its Completion in the Antitype: There could be no Propriety in continu|ing the Use of a sacred Sign of Christ's Blood hereafter to be shed, when his Blood had been shed already.&mdash;Our blessed Lord has therefore instituted another Seal of this Covenant, proper to commemorate our Redemption by his Blood; and to represent to us the cleansing Efficacy of that Blood, by which we have been redeem'd.&mdash;By the former Seal of this Covenant, the faithful were led to look to a Saviour to come and save them by his Blood; by the present Seal of this Covenant, the faithful are di|rected to look to that Saviour who is already come, and has redeem'd them with his Blood; and to look to that Blood as what alone will cleanse them from all Sin.</P>
<P>Thus I have fully prov'd to you, that the Covenant made with <HI>Abraham</HI> was the Covenant of Grace; that it was made with him and with both his natural and spi|ritual Seed; that the Obligations of this Covenant ex|tend to the believing Gentiles, as well as to the Jews; and that one of the Obligations of this Covenant was, that it should be sealed to <HI>Infants</HI> in their early Infancy: Does it not therefore necessarily follow, tho' the Seal be changed, that it may be adapted to the present Dispensation, that yet we are by the Tenor of that Co|venant obliged to have it sealed by the new, as well as by the old Seal, to <HI>Infants</HI> in their early Infancy? Does it not necessarily follow, since an Interest in the Promise of this Covenant gives a Right to <HI>Baptism</HI>(as appears from <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 38, 39.) that our Children who have an Interest in the Promise of this Covenant (as is strongly asserted in the same Text) have thereby an un|doubted Right to <HI>Baptism?</HI>&mdash;Does it not necessarily follow, since <HI>the Blessing of Abraham is come on the
<PB N="19" REF="005759_0018_0000000000000000">
Gentiles thro' Jesus Christ, that we might receive the Promise of the Spirit thro' Faith</HI> (Gal. iii. 14.) that sealing the Covenant to our Infant Seed, which was one of the great Blessings of <HI>Abraham,</HI> is also come on the Gentiles by Jesus Christ; and that since we receive the Promise thro' Faith, that <HI>God would be the God of Abraham and his Seed,</HI> we also should seal that Promise to our Infant Seed, as <HI>Abraham</HI> did?</P>

<P>There is (I confess) much more Appearance of Evidence in this Case than I have ever before consi|der'd; but yet I seem to want (methinks) some more satisfying Evidence, that Children under the present Dis|pensation are in the same Manner Partakers of the ex|ternal Blessings of the Covenant, as they were among the Jews.</P>

I4. <HI>Suffer little Children, and forbid them not to come unto me: for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI>&mdash;How, and which Way should we bring our little Children to Christ, but in the Way of his Ordinances? If they belong to the Kingdom of Heaven (whether we understand by it the Kingdom of Grace, or the Kingdom of Glory) they must have a Right to the Privileges of that King|dom, and a Claim to have their Title sealed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> by Baptism.&mdash;So likewise, Mat. xviii. 6. <HI>And whoso shall offend one of these little Ones which believe in me, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> better for him that a Millstone were hanged about his Neck, and that he were drowned in the Depths of the Sea.</HI> That this little One here refer'd to, was in an Infant State, appears, not only because he is here called a <HI>little Child,</HI> ver.2. but also, because we are assured in <HI>Mark</HI> ix.36. (where we have a Narrative of the same Thing) that our Saviour <HI>took him in his Arms.</HI> Now then, if such little Children are reputed by him who is <HI>the Author and Finisher of our Faith,</HI> to be Believers in him, we see here a full Anticipation of the common Objection
<PB N="21" REF="005759_0020_0000000000000000">
against the <HI>Baptism of Infants,</HI> and a Justification of their Claim to the Seal of the Righteousness of Faith, as well as a strong Declaration of the awful Danger of offending these little Ones, by denying them the Covenant|Privileges, to which they have a righteous Claim.&mdash;We have in like Manner the same thing repre|sented to us, I<HI>Cor.</HI> vii. 14. <HI>&mdash;Else were your Children unclean; but now are they holy.</HI> If either of the Parents be a Believer, the Children are reputed <HI>holy,</HI> that is, they have a <HI>Covenant Holiness,</HI> and have therefore a Claim to Covenant Privileges; such Children are <HI>holy,</HI> as God's ancient <HI>Israel</HI> are so often called an <HI>holy People;</HI> they are <HI>holy</HI> by Virtue of their Covenant Relation to God, and must therefore have a Right to have that Covenant sealed to them in <HI>Baptism.</HI>&mdash;I may add to this, that as the Commission to the sacred Ministry, <HI>Mat.</HI> xxviii. 19. enjoin'd the baptizing of <HI>all Nations,</HI> whereof Infants are a very great part; it also enjoin'd the baptizing Infants as a Part of the Nations they were to <HI>disciple</HI> and <HI>baptize;</HI> and it's plain, that the Apostles thus under|stood our Saviour's Meaning, and accordingly baptized <HI>Lydia and her Household, the Taylor and all his,</HI> Acts xvi. 15, 33. And the <HI>Household of Stephanus,</HI> 1 Cor. i. 16.&mdash;To add but one Text more, which must be allowed to be decisive in the present Case: We are assured, <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. from 17 to 25, that the Gentile Churches are <HI>grassed</HI> into the Jewish Stock, are <HI>Branches</HI> growing from the <HI>Root</HI> of that <HI>Olive-Tree,</HI> and partake of the <HI>Root and Fatness of it;</HI> and that the Jews, when converted to the Christian Faith, will be again <HI>grassed into their own Olive Tree.</HI> From whence it is most evident, that since the believing Gentiles are grassed into all the Privileges and spiritual Blessings of the Jewish Church, they cannot be cut off from that great Blessing and Privilege of having the Covenant sealed to their Infant Seed; and since
<PB N="22" REF="005759_0021_0000000000000000">
the Jews are again to be grassed into their own Olive|Tree, their Children will, as formerly, be Partakers of the Fatness of it, and have the Covenant sealed to them. The Olive-Tree remains the same that it was before; the Gospel Dispensation manures and cultivates it, and makes it flourish more gloriously, but by no Means deprives it of any of its former Fatness.&mdash;Thus I have shewn you the bright Fulfilment of that ancient Prophecy in <HI>Jer.</HI> xxx. 9, 20. That under the Gospel Dispensation, when the Church <HI>shall serve the Lord their God, and Da|vid their King, whom be would raise up unto them,&mdash;their Children also should be as aforetime.</HI></P>

<P>You have acknowledged, that under the legal Dispensation, it was a great Privilege for Infants to en|joy the Seal of the Covenant; I have demanded of you, and must still demand of you an Account, how they came to lose this Privilege? The Infants of God's professing People once had this Privilege, and it may either be prov'd, that they are some Way depriv'd of it, or it must be allow'd, that they still enjoy it.&mdash;Here then the Cause might rest, till you can bring some rational and scriptural Evidence, that the coming of Christ, and the Dispensa|tion of the Gospel, has cut off these Branches from the Olive-Tree: but that I might fully satisfy you, I have prov'd to you, that Infants are not cut off from this precious Privilege; that the Covenant Promise is still made, and therefore still to be sealed to our Children; that little Ones do believe in Christ; do belong to the Kingdom of Heaven; have a Covenant Holiness; are a Part of the Nations whom Ministers are required to baptize; do belong to the same Olive-Tree now, as un|der the legal Dispensation, and should partake of all the
<PB N="23" REF="005759_0022_0000000000000000">
Fatness of it; and are as <HI>aforetime;</HI> and should there|fore be suffered to come to Christ, partake of the Seal of the Covenant, and enjoy all the Privileges of the former Dispensation.&mdash;It therefore concerns you to take Heed that you don't <HI>offend these little Ones</HI> (by denying them these Privileges, which they have never forfeited) <HI>it were better for you, that a Millstone were hang'd about your Neck, and that you were drown'd in the Depths of the Sea.&mdash;Take Heed that you don't despise one of these little Ones,</HI> (by treat|ing them as unmeet or unqualified for a Covenant Rela|tion) <HI>for I say unto you, that in Heaven their Angels do al|ways behold the Face of my Father which is in Heaven, Mat.</HI> xviii. 10.</P>

<P>Here's a Lexicon; here are several Criticks upon the Greek Language; read, and see if they don't every one agree, that the Word signifies to <HI>Disciple,</HI> or <HI>constitute Learners,</HI> and not to teach: The Words ought therefore to be read, <HI>Go disciple all Nations, baptizing them;</HI> and it is accordingly rendred in the Margin of our English Bibles, <HI>make Disciples or Christians of all Na|tions.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>They may be made Disciples (or admitted into Christ's School, which is the same Thing) by <HI>Baptism;</HI> and so this Commission should be understood, as requir|ing the Ministers of the Gospel to make all Nations Dis|ciples, by baptizing them; and none, either Adult or Infants, are to be consider'd as visible Disciples of Christ, till they are baptized. <HI>Baptism</HI> is the Ordinance by which every one is to be entred into the School of Christ, and <HI>constituted a Learner</HI> of him.</P>

<P>Well, this can be done; you may find an In|stance full to the Purpose in <HI>Acts</HI> xv. 10. <HI>Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a Yoke upon the Neck of the Dis|ciples, which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear?</HI> The Yoke referred to was <HI>Circumcision,</HI> this was laid up|on the Neck of Infants at eight Days old; such Infants therefore are the Persons here called <HI>Disciples:</HI> and such Infants were then made <HI>Disciples</HI> by <HI>Circumcision,</HI> but now by <HI>Baptism.</HI> If there were some <HI>adult</HI> Persons in
<PB N="25" REF="005759_0024_0000000000000000">
the then-present State of Things, upon whose Neck the Jewish Teachers would have laid the Yoke of <HI>Circumci|sion;</HI> yet you must own, that at least the greatest Part of those Disciples, upon whom they would have imposed this Yoke, were young Children.&mdash;But what need have we to enquire, whether the English Word <HI>Disciple</HI> is ex|pressly apply'd to Infants, when the Thing signified by it so often occurs in Scripture? Every Text of Scripture, which represents young Children as belonging to God, and to be <HI>his Sons and Daughters, and his Children</HI> (as the Children of his Covenant People are stiled, <HI>Ezek.</HI> xvi 20, 21.) declare them to be <HI>Disciples;</HI> for this repre|sents God's special Propriety in them, as belonging to God's School, under Obligation to learn of him, which is the true Notion of a <HI>Disciple.</HI>&mdash;Every Text of Scrip|ture which obliges us to take Care, that <HI>our Children which have not known any Thing, may hear, and learn to fear the Lord</HI> (as <HI>Deut.</HI> xxxi. 13.) <HI>To train up our Chil|dren in the Way they should go</HI> (as <HI>Prov.</HI> xxii. 6.) And to <HI>bring up our Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord</HI> (as<HI>Eph.</HI> vi. 4.) obliges us to constitute them <HI>Lear|ners,</HI> or which is expresly the same Thing, to make them <HI>Disciples</HI> of Christ.&mdash;In a Word, <HI>Learners</HI> and <HI>Disciples</HI> are synonymous Terms, of the very same Significancy: and therefore, since the youngest <HI>Infants</HI> may be put into Christ's School, to be <HI>Learners</HI> of him, they may be made his <HI>Disciples,</HI> according to the Tenor of the Commission before consider'd.</P>

<P>I am satisfied upon that Point; but I have a|nother Difficulty before me, that I do not yet know how to get clear of; and that is, how it's possible that Infants who know nothing of Christ, can be Believers in him; Faith seems to be consider'd in the New-Tes|tament as a Pre-requisite to <HI>Baptism,</HI> and <HI>Baptism</HI> to be a Seal of our Faith in Christ; and how then can Infants be meet Subjects of it?</P>

<P>Don't you know, that this Argument could have been urg'd with the same Force against <HI>Circumcision,</HI> as it now can against <HI>Baptism?</HI> The Apostle assures us, <HI>that Circumcision</HI> was a <HI>Seal of the Righteousness of Faith,</HI> Rom. iv. 11.

and be renewed and sanctified by the blessed Spirit, since they must otherwise all be in a State of Guilt &amp; Condem|nation.

I think, you dare not pretend, that the <HI>Females</HI> of <HI>Abraham's</HI> Posterity were not in <HI>Covenant</HI> with God: and it is certain, that you cannot pretend, this Covenant was sealed to the <HI>Females</HI> any other Way, than by the <HI>Circumcision</HI> of the <HI>Males.</HI> But tho' <HI>Females</HI> were not capable Subjects of that typical Seal of the Covenant, the Case is altered under the present Dispensa|tion: and the Apostle tells us, <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 27, 28, 29. that as <HI>many as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ:</HI> And that none of the <HI>Distinctions</HI> of the ancient Dispensa|tion now remain; <HI>There is neither Jew nor Greek,</HI> the one in Covenant, and the other not; <HI>There is neither Male nor Female,</HI> the one personally to receive the Seal of the Covenant, and the other not: <HI>For ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abra|ham's Seed, and Heirs according to the Promise.</HI> The Cove|nant has been sealed according to the Nature of the respective Dispensations. According to the legal and typical Dispensation, it was sealed to the Seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> after the Flesh, while the <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Gentile</HI> Nations were excluded; it was sealed to <HI>all</HI> his Seed, in the Persons of the <HI>Males</HI> only, who alone were capable Subjects of that bloody typical Rite. But now under the Gospel-Dispen|sation, this middle Wall of Partition is broken down, and none of these legal Distinctions remain. <HI>As many as are baptized into Christ,</HI> whether they be <HI>Jew or Greek, Bond or Free, Male or Female, are all one in Christ Jesus,</HI> all <HI>Abraham's Seed,</HI> all <HI>Heirs according to the Promise,</HI> according to that Promise which was made <HI>to us and to our Children.</HI></P>

<P>You have fully removed this Difficulty also; and yet I must entreat you to bear with me while I pro|pose one Objection more.&mdash;There are some who suppose the <HI>Promise</HI> mention'd <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 39. (which you have several Times taken Notice of) instead of being as you suppose the <HI>Promise</HI> made to <HI>Abraham,</HI> is the <HI>Promise</HI> of that Effusion of the Spirit predicted by <HI>Joel,</HI> and apply'd to that extraordinary Descent of the Holy Ghost, with his miraculous Gifts upon the Day of <HI>Pentecost:</HI> this <HI>Pro|mise</HI> you know, is mention'd by the Apostle in the 16th Verse of that Chapter; and why should be not refer to the same <HI>Promise</HI> in the 39th Verse, which he had been speaking of but a little before?</P>

<SP>

<P>Do you seriously think, that those miraculous Gifts predicted by <HI>Joel,</HI> are the Matter of that <HI>Promise</HI> which gives a Claim to <HI>Baptism?</HI> If so, none have a Right to <HI>Baptism,</HI> but they who have the Gift of <HI>Prophecy,</HI> who see <HI>Visions,</HI> and <HI>dream Dreams.</HI>&mdash;Do you seriously think, that this <HI>Promise</HI> of miraclous Gifts was made to all the Christian <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>their Children,</HI> and to <HI>all</HI> that are <HI>afar off,</HI> to all the <HI>Gentiles</HI> whom <HI>the Lord our God shall call</HI> into a Church-State? Or has that <HI>Promise</HI> ever been fulfilled to them? The mere Mention of such trifling Supposals is a sufficient Refutation of 'em.&mdash;I have al|ready shewn you, that there is no other <HI>Promise</HI> made both to <HI>Jews &amp; Gentiles,</HI> which can give a Right to <HI>Baptism,</HI> but only the <HI>Promise</HI> which was made to <HI>Abraham.</HI>&mdash;This <HI>Promise</HI> was of such vast Importance, so well known and so much consider'd, that when mention'd by the Apostles, it is emphatically called <HI>The Promise,</HI> without any special Declaration, what <HI>Promise</HI> is meant; this very frequently occurs in the New-Testament, with respect to the <HI>promise</HI> made to <HI>Abraham;</HI> but I ha'n't observ'd it ever to occur with Relation to any other <HI>Promise</HI> whatsoever.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already shewn you, that by a divine per|petual Institution the Covenant of Grace is to be <HI>Sealed to Believers,</HI> and to their <HI>Infant Seed.</HI>&mdash;It therefore lies at your Door to prove, that the coming of our blessed Saviour, and the more excellent Dispensation of the Gospel, has cut off <HI>Infants</HI> from this most precious and valuable Pri|vilege; and that the Gospel is a <HI>less glorious</HI> Dispensa|tion with Respect to <HI>Infants,</HI> than the former Dispensa|tion was; that instead of bringing them any new Advan|tages, it has depriv'd them of those which they formerly enjoy'd.&mdash;This, I think, you won't attempt to prove, and therefore you must allow, that their perpetual Right to have the Covenant of Grace sealed to'em, still remains, by Force of the original Institu|tion, and is by no Means vacated.&mdash;You require express New-TestamentProof, that <HI>Infants</HI> are to be <HI>baptized;</HI> and I require of you express New-Testament Proof, that <HI>Women</HI> should partake of the <HI>Lord's Supper:</HI> prove the latter by what Arguments you please, and I will prove the former by the same.&mdash;Are <HI>Women</HI> in Covenant? So are the <HI>Infants</HI> of believing Parents.&mdash;Are <HI>Women Believ|ers?</HI> So are some <HI>Infants.</HI>&mdash;Are <HI>Women</HI> Disciples of Christ?

<P>I hope, this may be easily done: Can you find any Thing like an Institution for <HI>Dipping</HI> or <HI>Plunging,</HI> in the New-Testament?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, the original <HI>Commission,</HI> which requires the Ministers of the Gospel to <HI>batize,</HI> requires them to <HI>dip;</HI> it being the natural Signification of the Greek Word, <HI>Baptize,</HI> to dip, to plunge, or overwhelm with Water.</P>

<P>There can be nothing more chimerical, than this Pretence. I have never seen one single <HI>Lexicographer</HI> or <HI>Critick</HI> upon the Greek Language, but what agrees, that tho' the Word <HI>Baptize</HI> sometimes signifies to<HI>dip,</HI> yet it also naturally signifies to <HI>wash;</HI> and that <HI>Washing</HI> (in any Mode whatsoever) is the native Signification of the Word <HI>Baptismos.</HI>&mdash;Here are <HI>Scapula, Stephanus, Schrivelius, Passor, Martin, and Leigh,</HI> (the Books you but now look'd into upon the other verbal Debate) search them, and see if they don't every one of 'em justi|fy my Explication of the Words <HI>Baptizo</HI> and <HI>Baptismos.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>The directest Method to be ascertained of the true Meaning of these Words, is, to consider how they are used in the <HI>New-Testament;</HI> the inspired Writers certainly knew in what Sense the Words were used by our blessed Lord, and in what Sense they themselves un|derstood them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neigh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This seems indeed to be the surest and most satisfying Method of Enquiry into this Matter: you'll therefore oblige me, by giving me a just View of the Use of these Words in the New-Testament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would take too much Time to enumerate all the Places where these Words occur; or to make par|ticular Remarks upon such Passages as I shall enumerate: I shall only propose some brief <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ints, which will be suf|ficient to clear this Case beyond any just Matter of Doubt or Objection.&mdash;The Descent of the Holy Ghost in cloven Tongues like Fire upon the <HI>Apostles</HI> and Com|pany, and upon <HI>Cornelius</HI> and Company, was called <HI>bap|tizing,</HI> Acts. i.5. and Chap. xi. 16. You can't pretend that here was the least Allusion to or Resemblance of <HI>Dipping,</HI> or <HI>Plunging,</HI> in this Use of the Word.&mdash;Our blessed Saviour's Persecution and Crucifixion is called <HI>the Baptism he was baptized withal,</HI> Mark x. 38, 39. I think, you will readily allow, that being buffetted, spit upon, and lifted up upon the Cross, bears no Resem|blance, nor can have any Allusion to <HI>Dipping, or Plung|ing.</HI>&mdash;It is said of the <HI>Pharisees and all the Jews,</HI> that <HI>when they come from the Market, except they wash</HI> (Bap|tisontal) <HI>they eat not. And many other Things there be,
<PB N="33" REF="005759_0032_0000000000000000">
which they have received to hold, as the washing</HI> (Baptis|mous) <HI>of Cups, and Pots, brazen Vessels, and of Tables</HI> (or BEDS, as the original Word properly signifies, and ought to be translated.) I think, this is an unexceptionable Instance of these Words signifying <HI>Washing,</HI> without <HI>Dip|ping</HI> or <HI>Plunging:</HI> for you yourself can hardly suppose, that they <HI>dipt</HI> themselves under Water every Time they came from the Market, or that they <HI>dipt</HI> their BEDS every Time they sat or lay upon them. We are told, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 1, 2. that <HI>all the Fathers were under the Cloud, and were all baptized unto</HI> Moses <HI>in the Cloud.</HI> I think, I need not seriously undertake to convince you, that the Fathers were not <HI>dipt</HI> in the Cloud; but that the Rain from the Cloud bore a much greater Resemblance to <HI>Sprinkling</HI> or <HI>Affusion,</HI> than to <HI>Dipping.</HI>&mdash;I shall only add, that the Apostle speaking of the ceremonial Dispensati|on, tells us, that it <HI>flood only in Meats and Drinks, and diverse Washings</HI> (Baptismous) <HI>and carnal Ordinances,</HI> Heb. ix. 10. The Principal of these <HI>Washings</HI> (or <HI>Baptisms</HI>) of which the ceremonial Dispensation consisted, the Apostle exemplifies to us in the 13th Verse, to be the <HI>Blood of Bulls, and of Goats, and the Ashes of an Heifer sprinkling the Unclean.</HI> Here therefore the Word cannot, with any Appearance of Modesty, be explain'd in your Fa|vour. From all this it therefore necessarily follows, that the Words <HI>Baptise</HI> and <HI>Baptism,</HI> do not from their Sig|nification make <HI>Dipping,</HI> or <HI>Plunging,</HI> the necessary Mode of administring the Ordinance.</P>
<P>But now let us turn the Tables, and see if you can find any one Place in the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> where these Words necessarily carry <HI>Dipping, or Plunging,</HI> in their Signification: If you can't (as I am confident you can't) find one Instance of this kind, you have Reason to be for ever silent upon that Head.</P>

<P>I must acknowledge my very great Ignorance, if the Matter be as you represent it: I have with very careful Application look'd into this Case, and could ne|ver yet find one Single Instance of that Mode of admi|nistring the Ordinance, in all the <HI>New-Testament.</HI>&mdash;There are, I confess, some Passages in our <HI>English</HI> Tran|slation of the Bible, which have that Appearance: But if you will look into the original <HI>Greek,</HI> you will find, that none of those Texts will necessarily Prove, that any one Person was baptized by <HI>dipping,</HI> either by <HI>John Bap|tist,</HI> our blessed <HI>Saviour,</HI> or his <HI>Apostles.</HI>&mdash;But then on the contrary, there are a Variety of Instances of the ad|ministring this Ordinance, which give us sufficient Evi|dence, that <HI>Dipping</HI> was not, could not be, the Mode of Administration.</P>

<P>As to the first of these Instances, there is no more in the Original, than that our Saviour <HI>went up straightway</HI> (apo) <HI>FROM the Water.</HI> I think you will allow, that the Greek Preposition <HI>(Apo)</HI> always naturally signifies FROM, but never OUT OF: and therefore that Instance can stand you in no Stead.</P>

<PB N="36" REF="005759_0035_0000000000000000">
(iii) there rendered <HI>into,</HI> naturally signifies <HI>unto,</HI> and is commonly so used in the New-Testament. Thus, <HI>Matth.</HI> xv. 24. UNTO <HI>the lost Sheep.</HI> Joh. xiii. 1.

In all which and many other Places, the Preposition is used in the Sense I plead for, and cannot with any Modesty be ren|dered INTO. I might add one Instance more, which I am sure you must acknowledge to be altogether un|exceptionable: it is in <HI>John</HI> xx. 45. <HI>And the other Disciple did out-run Peter, and came first</HI> TO <HI>the Sepulchre</HI> (eis to mnemion) <HI>yet went he not in.</HI>&mdash;I hope, by this Time you are satisfied, that there is no Evidence from this Text, that the <HI>Eunuch</HI> was baptized by <HI>Dipping.</HI></P>

<P>The Greek Preposition <HI>(EK)</HI> here rendered <HI>out of,</HI> properly signifies <HI>from;</HI> as might be illustrated to you by innumerable Instances.

<P>What Reason can be assigned for such express Mention in the cited Texts, of <HI>going to the Water,</HI> and <HI>coming from the Water,</HI> at the Administration of <HI>Baptism,</HI> if the Ordinance was not administred by <HI>Dipping?</HI></P>

<P>It is remarkable, that there is no mention of going to, or coming from the Water, when the Ordinance

<P>The Apostle tells us, <HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 4. <HI>That we are buried with Christ by Baptism into Death.</HI>&mdash;Now what Resemblance is there in <HI>Baptism</HI> to a <HI>Burial,</HI> unless it be administred by <HI>Dipping?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are also taught in the foregoing Verse, that we are <HI>baptized into Christ's Death:</HI> Now what Resemblance is there in Baptism to Christ's dying upon the Cross, if we are baptized by <HI>Dipping?</HI> Was there any Thing like <HI>Dipping,</HI> in our Saviour's Crucifixion?&mdash;If we consider the Words cited by you, what is it, that Baptism (upon your Acceptation of the Words) must resemble, according to the <HI>Letter</HI> of that Text? Is it not Christ's being <HI>buied into Death?</HI> This (if any such Resemblance be designed) is plainly the Thing to be imitated, according to the express Words of that Text. And was Christ indeed literally <HI>buried into Death?</HI> Was his Burial the Cause of his Death? Or would you have such a Manner of Death resembled in <HI>Baptism,</HI> by drowning Men when you baptize them? Could the Apostle, by the Words before us, design to communicate any such Idea as this? No certainly!&mdash;It is most evident, that this Text has no Reference at all to the Imitation, either of Christ's Death or Burial, or to any particular Mode of administring that Ordinance but the plain manifest Scope of the Words is, to shew us our Obligation by <HI>Baptism,</HI> unto a Conformity to the Death and Resurrection of Christ, by <HI>dying unto Sin,</HI> and <HI>rising again unto Newness of Life.</HI>&mdash;And the same Answer will serve for the parallel Text, <HI>Col.</HI> ii. 12.</P>

<P>I must acknowledge, that you have indeed answered my Objections; &amp; sufficiently prov'd, that we cannot certainly conclude from the Instances cited by me, that <HI>Baptism</HI> was administred by <HI>Dipping</HI> or <HI>Plunging.</HI>

<P>Either you or I are in a great Mistake in this Matter.&mdash;We read, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 41. That there were <HI>three Thousand</HI> baptized at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in one Day (most cer|tainly towards the close of the Day) and was there any Probability (I had almost said, Possibility) that they should all be <HI>baptized</HI> by <HI>Dipping</HI> in so short a Time? Or is it probable, that they could so suddenly find Water sufficient in that City, for the <HI>Dipping</HI> of such a Multitude; espe|cially, while they were yet so firmly attached to the Ceremonial Institution, which made it unlawful for two Persons to be <HI>dipt</HI> in the same Vessel of Water?&mdash;The Narrative of <HI>Paul's Baptism</HI> makes it appear to be administred in his <HI>Bed-Room,</HI> where he had lain three Days blind, without Meat &amp; Drink; but upon <HI>Ananias's</HI> speaking to him <HI>received sight forthwith,</HI> and <HI>arose, and was Baptized.</HI> Acts ix. 9, 18.&mdash;The Words of the Text seem plainly to contradict the <HI>dipping</HI> of <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his Houshold. <HI>Acts</HI> x. 47 <HI>Can any Man forbid Water, that these should not be baptized?</HI> Certainly the Apostle did not speak of <HI>forbidding</HI> the Water to run in the River, or to remain in any other Receptacle or Reservoir of Water: and therefore must speak of bringing Water for their <HI>Baptism;</HI> the Words must in any other Sense be altogether unintelligible.&mdash;The <HI>Taylor</HI> and his Houshold were <HI>baptized</HI> in the dead of the <HI>Night,</HI> in the same Hour of his Conviction by the Earthquake: and therefore there was no Probability (nor indeed Possibility) of their going to any Depth of Water, for that Purpose. <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. 33. <HI>And he took them the same Hour of the Night, and washed their Stripes; and was baptized, be and all his, straightway.&mdash;</HI> These Instances are sufficient to convince
<PB N="39" REF="005759_0038_0000000000000000">
any unprejudiced Person, that the Ordinance was not ad|ministred by <HI>Dipping,</HI> in the Apostolick Times.</P>

<P>As <HI>Dipping</HI> was the Mode of the <HI>greatest Pu|rification</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> in that typical Dispensation, does it not make it look probable, that the <HI>same</HI> Mode would be continued in that Ordinance, which is to re|present our <HI>Purification</HI> by the Blood of Christ, and by the Influences of the blessed Spirit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Min.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Query is founded upon a great Mistake. <HI>For the Blood of Bulls, and of Goats, and the Ashes of an Heifer</HI> (or the Water of Purification) SPRINKLING <HI>the Unclean,</HI> was the greatest Purification among the Jews. <HI>Lev.</HI> xvi. 14, 16. <HI>Numb.</HI> xix. 2, 17. <HI>Heb.</HI> ix. 13. Ac|cordingly our Cleansing by the Blood of Christ, and by the Influences of the blessed Spirit, are frequently repre|sented by <HI>Sprinkling,</HI> but never by <HI>Dipping.</HI> Thus, 1 Pet. i. 2. <HI>Thro' Sanctification of the Spirit unto Obedience, and</HI> SPRINKLING <HI>of the Blood of Jesus Christ.</HI> Heb. xii. 24. <HI>And to the Blood of</HI> SPRINKLING, <HI>that speaketh bet|ter Things than that of</HI> Abel. Ezek. xxxvi. 25. <HI>I will</HI> SPRINKLE <HI>clean Water upon you; and ye shall be clean.</HI> So likewise, <HI>Isa.</HI> lii. 15. <HI>So shall he</HI> SPRINKLE <HI>many Nations.</HI>&mdash;In like Manner the Influences of the Spirit are represented by <HI>Affusion.</HI> Prov. i. 23. <HI>I will</HI> POUR <HI>my Spirit unto you.</HI> See also <HI>Isa.</HI> xiiv. 3. <HI>Joel</HI> ii. 28, 29. <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 17, 18.&mdash;I may therefore Justly retort your Ar|gument. Since <HI>Sprinkling</HI> was the <HI>greatest Purification</HI> amongst the Jews, and the Blood of Christ and the In|fluences of the Holy Spirit are frequently represented by <HI>Sprinkling,</HI> and by <HI>Affusion,</HI> but never by <HI>Dipping;</HI> it is a natural and just Conclusion, that our Mode of admini|string the Ordinance of <HI>Baptism</HI> is a more lively Emblem of what is signified and represented by it, than <HI>Dipping</HI> or <HI>Plunging</HI> can be supposed: and therefore that <HI>ours</HI> is the most <HI>proper</HI> Mode of Administration.</P>
