<P>ALthough in the Popish Sense we m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y allow no sin to be Venial; (<HI>For the wages of every sin is death</HI>) yet there are doubtless degrees in sin, some are in their nature &amp; circumstances more peculiarly aggravated, and expose to a much sorer Con|demnation: Among which may be reckoned those which are not only violations of positive Precepts, but of the very dictates and law of na|ture; in such sins there is both a contempt of the Divine Authority, and a great deal of vio|lence offered to Conscience, which would re|strain from the commission of them, and is a plain dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nstration of prevailing Atheism of the heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd mighty power and love of sin in it, to over bear the light they have; but that such sins should be committed under the clear light of the Gospel, shews men to be wholly without excuse&punc; It therefore is, and ought to

That in such days there should be found so many sad instances of these horrid and unna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ural sins of Murther and Un|cleanness; but especially of this latter, that there is ground to fear, that it hath been one of the things for which God hath so long had a con|troversie wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the Land: As for what is obvious to men of this nature, we have reason to hope, that the Land is free from the guilt of it, by the vigilance and fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hfulness of those to whom God hath committed the Sword of Justice; but there are many things of this nature secret, which the method of God in his Judgments seems directly to point at. It is noted among the procuring cau|ses of <HI>Israels</HI> miseries, 2 <HI>King</HI> 17.9.

Deut. 13.11. <HI>All Israel shall hear and fear, and do no more presumptuously,</HI> on which account it seems very sutable to accompany such sad in|stances with solemn warnings, that those who are under the like guilt, may be awakened, and others may be awed; and it is especially need|ful, that persons be put in remembrance of the dreadful consequence of these things in the world to come; in comparison of which, the greatest shame, and severe penalties here, are as nothing; and as the Judgment of God is more severe, so it is more certai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he hath positively declared, Heb. 13.4. <HI>Whoremongers and adulterers God will Iudge</HI>; these works of darkness may escape the notice, so the Judgment of men, but there will be no escaping the Judgment of God; there is no darkness or shadow of death where the workers of Iniquity may hide themselves; the eye of God follows men into their darkest recesses, and he will surely have a day to bring to light the hidden things of darkness.

these Ends, it is that many of the Hear+ers of the following sollid and seasonable Warn|ing delivered just before the Execution of a person convicted of these horrid sins of Mur|ther and Adultery, have desired the publication of it; to which the Author hath consented, being desirous to further the right Improvement of such a sad Example, to deter others from the like abominations. As for the person Exe|cuted for these sins, she is an awful instance of the infatuating, hardening and stupifying power of this bruitish Sin of Uncleanness, her love to, &amp; frequent practice of it, having occasio|ned her stifling many convictions, &amp; contracted a fearful stupidity and sottishness upon her, near the approaches of death.

To conclude therefore, let me perswade all to consider, the heinous nature, and dreadful effects of these sins; the Apo|stle gives a particular account hereof, 1 Cor. 6.9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Its a sin against a mans own body, it is a defiling of that which should be the temple of God; it is a Sin loathsome in it self, and makes those who are guilty of it, loathsome to God, and to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n too, when it is discovered; it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sin that is ordinarily the punishment of other

That persons would more carefully avoid the inducements to this Sin which are too common: Such are, over costly, light ga|rish Attire, impudent and immodest cartia|ges, filthy communications, idleness, intempe|rance, by which the body is inflamed, and modesty banished; the command that for|bids the acts of Uncleanness, forbids also the occasions and tendencies to it; and unless there be a tenderness and watchfulness to avoid these, there will be little hopes, that gross pollutions will be avoided. Thus com|mending the following Warnings to the Blessing of God, and to the serious consi|deration of the Rising Generation.</P>

<P>SInners promise themselves a great deal of pleasure, satisfaction and delight in the ways of Disobedience, to the holy Com|mands of God; but the destinations and appointments of God to them are far otherwise.

<P>Hell Torments will be the portion of all Im|penitent and Unclean Persons. I have singled but these two, rather then the rest; because God in his Providence, calls me to bear testimony a|gainst these, and to warn one in a peculiar man|ner convicted of both these, and under a just <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">entence of Death, speedily to repent, and get <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pardon in the blood of Christ.</P>
<P>Uncleanness and Murder are Sins that God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unisheth not only in this life, but in the world to come; when the natural life of these shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xpired, and that by Divine Appointment, worse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orrows then ever they endured here, shall seiz <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pon, and apprehend them; the sufferings of wrath here, and loss of life, by divine vengeance, will not expiate, guiltiness; but divine wrath will pursue and abide on the guilty in the other world: One Death will lead to another; the First Death makes way for the Second. God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on't punish the Guilty only with Damnation, but Everlasting Damnation: Sinners dying un|der the guilt of these sins, shall not only be Damned, but everlastingly Damned.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>How doth it appear, that God will punish them that dye under the guilt of these sins, with E|verlasting Damnation?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. From Scripture Threatnings and Commi|nations.
<PB N="14" REF="000902_0012_0FAC9C2BA4966CB0">
God is not a man that he should lye, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ither the Son of man that he should repent; hath he said, and shall he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? God that said of old, that he would Chastize, as their Congregation had heard, God who is truth, and cannot lye, who after he had threatned his impenitent people in ancient times for their A|postacy, warned them against flattering them|selves with hopes of impunity, by saying, the Lord have spoken it; this God hath in his Word threatned thus to deal with Unclean Sinners, &amp; commanded them not to deceive themselves with hopes of a less punishment. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.9, 10. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.6. these Exclusions from the King|dom of Heaven, comprehend in them positive punishments, even the punishment of Eternal Damnation. If Sinners hearing the curses and threatnings of Gods Word, embolden themselves with promising themselves happiness, they will find themselves in the issue, separated to all evil. <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.19, 20. <HI>For heaven and earth shall sooner pass away, than one jot or tittle of Gods word fail of its accomplishment.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Because these are Transgressors of the Ho|ly Law of God, and Damnation is one to them on this account. <HI>Rom</HI> 6.23. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.13. <HI>Every Sin is a transgression of the Holy Law of God</HI>; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s therefore a meet and a reasonable thing that they should have their due: Hell and Damna|tion
<PB N="15" REF="000902_0013_0FAC9C2C8ED29DE0">
are as really due to them, and deserved by them in this their last end, as ever wages were to a man, at the end of his days work. God is neglected &amp; slighted, his holy Law trampled upon, for a little present carnal satisfaction; so that the Justice of God is concerned thus to deal with them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because these their sins are of a scarlet and crimson dye, aggravated iniquities filling up the measure of other sins; not barely transgressions and violations of a holy Law of God, but brea|ches of his Law, with such aggravations, that ripen for Damnation.</P>
<P N="1">1. Uncleanness is an aggravated iniquity, fil|ling up the measure of other sins. <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.18&punc; this appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. In that it is a sin that God leaves the ab|horred of his Soul, and reprobates to a wallow|ing and continuing in <HI>Eccles.</HI> 7.26. <HI>Prov.</HI> 22.14. A Sin that he leaves them to, that he never in|tends good to; these are left of God, to go the way to Hell; and not escaping these sins, they may not think to escape damnation. <HI>Prov.</HI> 7.27. <HI>Prov.</HI> 5.5. these expressions that the abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein, plainly intimates, that many previous and foregoing sinful courses, have provoked God to jealousie and hot displea|sure; and that he will leave them to this sin, to prepare them for a day of Vengeance.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Sin that takes away the heart from God,
<PB N="16" REF="000902_0014_0FAC9C2E70250320">
and that which is good. <HI>Hos.</HI> 4.11. It alienates and estrangeth the heart from God, and the ho|ly Commandment; it causeth sinners to disre|gard and slight promises and threatnings; it takes away the heart from thinking, and medi|tating of God, and his Word, from delighting in God and his Commandments, from contri|ving and studying how to please God, and obey his voice; so that they will not hearken to his voice, they will none of him; when the heart is thus taken off from God, and that which is good, the measure of sin will be filled up apace. <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.17.</P>
<P N="3">3. In that they are addicted and accustomed to this Sin, are hardened persons, and seldome truly repent. <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.19. <HI>Prov.</HI> 7.13.23. the Scrip|ture speaks of these, as the most impudent and sham<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">less sinners; yea, as thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that refuse to be ashamed; many of these past feeling. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.18, 19. Now when any are hardened from Gods fear, they will fall into mischief, and the heart of these will be set in them to do evil.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Sin that hath ruined and made desolate Nations and Lands, guilty of it: It drowned the Old World; it brought down Fire and Brimstone on <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> Gen. 19.13. <HI>Sodom</HI> had many other sins, as Pride, Idleness &amp; Gluttony; but this sin of Uncleanness made it a desolation; and a sin that eternally ruins and undoes the Soul. <HI>Prov.</HI> 6.32.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="17" REF="000902_0015_0FAC9C2EA4480E30">2. Murder is an aggravated Sin, filling up the measure of other sins; other sins treasure up wrath against the day of wrath: This sin ripens for cutting down, finisheth the transgression, and brings forth death: this appears, in</P>
<P N="1">1. That the cry of this sin, pierceth the very heavens, and brings down the Curse of God. <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.10, 11. he sinned in his wrath against his Brother; he finished that sin, in the murder of him. God admonished and warned him, for his passionateness, and angryness, but when he had committed this sin, saith God, <HI>Thou art cursed from the earth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Inasmuch as usually they are hardened a|gainst Gods fear, and contemners of God, that are thus guilty. <HI>Gen.</HI> 4 9 he doth not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all down and cry out against himself, for his own guilti|ness, but as though it were a light thing to break with God, he adds sin to sin; he lies, to hide his murder, and takes up God disdainfully, <HI>Am I my Brothers Keeper</HI>? A Parent, a Master, a Prince, would account such language from a Child, Servant or Subject, unallowable sawci|ness and contempt. He speaks as though it was an affront to put such a question to him: and therefore after God denounced a Curse on him, he doth not bewail the greatness of his sin, he doth not relent&punc; or manifest sorrow that he had sinned against God, as he had done; only saith, <HI>My punishment is greater than I can bear</HI>; and in|stead

This Sin of Uncleanness is one great cause why the Land mourns this day, and is a sin for which many will despairngly mourn at last, unless they spee|dily repent.

<P N="1">1. Or God may justly suffer you to be pu|nished in the same way that you abuse others. <HI>Iob</HI> 30.10.

Or, it's to be feared, that if once you yield, that you will hold on in such wayes till Death overtake you&punc; Sinners are stupified, that are left to these wayes of Sin: You have heard that few are recovered by unfeigned repen|tance. <HI>Stollen waters are so sweet and pleasant to ignorant carnal men, who know not that the dead are there, and that her guests are in the depths of hell; that they oftimes go on, till a dart strike thro' their liver,</HI> Prov. 7.23. the young man had so much conscience left him, that he wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld not yield, till with much fair speaking he was solli|cited, and then he goes on till death; these are oftimes so far besotted by their lusts, that re|proofs will be slighted by them. <HI>Hos.</HI> 4&punc;4.</P>

Unless men come to see and know the plague of their own hearts, they will be partial and feigned in their repentance: They that dont turn with their whole hearts, will fall back again, when a sui|table Temptation and Occasion is offered and pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ted.</P>
<P N="3">3. Beware that you dont flatter your selves as though you had repented before you have; repentance is not a saying before God with tears, that you are sorry for your transgressions: many turn, but not to the most High.</P>
<P N="4">4. See that Christ as a Sanctifier and Justifier be sought after by you, in respect of the guilt you lie under: you had need improve Christ as a Justifier, and as an Advocate. Oh! then go to Christ as to him who only can Justify, acquit, and absolve you from the guilt of Sin. 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 2.1, 2. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 1.29. From the consideration of the Power and Dominion of Sin: you have need of Christ as your only Sanctifier. Your Pray|ers, Reformations, Tears, won't Justifie you: Christ must be a Satisfyer for you, or Gods Justice can't be Satisfyed. And you have no way to get power against corruption, but by going to Christ as your Sanctification: Your Vows, Promises, Resolutions, Fastings, won't mortifie and kill any one sin in you; 'tis Christ
<PB N="38" REF="000902_0036_0FAC9C50634E0660">
must subdue your Sin in you, and for you.</P>
<P N="5">5. Improve present influences from the Spirit of God to draw you to Christ. Unless God by his Spirit draw you, you will never come to the Son: the Number of your Sins won't make you go to Christ; the Greatness of your Sins won't make you go to Christ: natural desires of hap|piness, and escaping Wrath &amp; Hell, won't bring you to Christ; these may cause you to play the Hypocrite, but they won't bring you to Christ: times of common Calamity &amp; Judgment won't drive you to Christ: thoughts and apprehensi|ons of Deaths drawing near and just at hand, ready to arrest you, won't prevail with you to go to Christ. You that delay and put off your repentance when God is striving with you, take heed, you can't convert your selves when you will, without Gods Spirit. Look upon this poor object before your eyes, and then consi|der whether any, or all the forementioned things, will make you fly to Christ. Improve the Spirit while it is at work on your Souls.</P>
<P N="6">6. Beware that you don't hearken to vain words and reasonings, tending to the lessening of your guiltiness, and your danger of Gods wrath and Judgment. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.6. Oh! <HI>know that for these things cometh the wrath of God upon the Children of disobedience.</HI> And since the Apostle hath cautioned thus, as to this sin; I would par|ticularly warn you, to take heed that you don't
<PB N="39" REF="000902_0037_0FAC9C51286625D8">
by vain reasonings prevent your speedy repen|ting, and turning to God: And shall in a few particulars shew you the Vanity of such reason|ings, as have a tendency to extenuate, and lessen your sin and danger, that you may not hearken to them, and deceive your own Souls.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some are ready to reason away apprehen|sions of Divine anger, because 'tis so long since they were guilty of them; if they had com|mitted these sins to day, yesterday, or but a few weeks ago; they should be afraid, and concern|ed to get them pardoned: but its so long since, that they have almost forgotten them; and if God had been much provoked he would not have born with them thus long.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Consider.</HI> God remembers them all, as though committed but yesterday: they are seal|ed up among his hid treasures. God said, <HI>Psal.</HI> 50. <HI>That he can set them in order before the sinners eyes.</HI> God won't only punish for a few of your latter sins only, but for all: If they were com|mitted when you were Young, he han't for|got them, for he sayes, <HI>He will bring you into Iudgment,</HI> for all your Youthful sins. <HI>Eccle.</HI> 11.9. They that have gone to God aright, have gone for the pardon of former sins; sins of Youth, as well as latter transgressions.</P>
<P N="2">2 God punisheth some men a long time after they have committed their sins. 'Tis true <HI>be|cause Sentence against an evil work is not speedily
<PB N="40" REF="000902_0038_0FAC9C51E1A9D7F8">
executed, that the hearts of the Sons of men are set in them to do evil</HI>; its no argument that you shall escape punishment, because God hath not yet punished you. Though God did not destroy the people in the Wilderness presently, but bore with their evil manners for forty years, yet he wasted that Generation. Hear what God sayes, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32.32. God waited on, and warned his people for twenty three years by his Prophet, and yet after all he destroyed them in his anger. <HI>Ier.</HI> 25.3, 7. <HI>Iude</HI> verse 5. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.9.</P>
<P N="3">3. It may be you have been under a Judicial process ever since. Sinners are sometimes stu|pid and don't observe the Strokes of God upon them; hear how unobservant they were that had been for so long a time under a course of Judgment. <HI>Ier.</HI> 44.19. compared with 20&mdash;24. The Judgments of God are sometimes more Spi|ritual, and so more undiscerned; God layes his plagues on some mens Souls, when he layes them on other mens bodies; <HI>He sends leanness into some mens Souls,</HI> when he sends leanness on others Estates. Han't God let you alone and poured upon you a Spirit of deep sleep? given you eyes, that you should not see, nor perceive, nor be converted to this day? To be left of God to go on stupidly in impenitency, is a very great testimony of Divine Wrath. Soul plagues are the forest plagues.</P>
<P N="4">4. The longer ago your sins were committed,
<PB N="41" REF="000902_0039_0FAC9C52A2EFB9C0">
the more hazardous your unconcernedness about repenting of them, &amp; getting a Pardon of them&punc; God wont be patient alwayes, though he is sometimes long suffering: if he waites on Sin|ners till they bring forth briers and thornes, he would have them know, <HI>they are nigh to Cursing.</HI> Yea, such as are impenitent after much long suffering, may fear that <HI>they are Vessels fitted to destruction. Rom.</HI> 9.22. God sayes, <HI>I come three years looking for fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t, and find none, cut it down why cumbereth it the ground.</HI> Luk. 13.7. <HI>ult.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Some are ready to argue that their sins are but little; if they had been left to gross acts of Fornication or Adultery, they acknowledge they should have had need to have hastened to Chrst for a pardon; but they were only guilty of some wanton dalliances, therefore they don't think God is very angry with them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Though some sins comparatively consider|ed are little, yet no sins absolutely considered are little and small, because against an Infinite God, and Violations and Transgressions of his holy Laws, and Commands.</P>
<P N="2">2. Such little sins, if your Consciences were awakened and enlightned would fill you with great perplexity, and distress: As long as the commandment did not come, with Convictions of its exactness, and spirituality on <HI>Pauls</HI> Con|science, he was <HI>alive</HI> and could do well enough; but when such an exposition, as Christ put upon
<PB N="42" REF="000902_0040_0FAC9C5362907AF0">
the Commandment came, <HI>sin revived, and he dyed</HI>; he was slain, and could justifie himself no longer.</P>
<P N="3">3. God finds stubbornness &amp; rebellion which are as that Sin of Witchraft, where Sinners can see only humane frailty and sins of Infirmity. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15.23. <HI>Saul</HI> saith, he had obeyed, then he had a good end in varying from the com|mand, or the people are to blame, but God tells him of rebellion and stubbornness which were to him as Witchcraft and Idolatry: God tells him that he had in so doing rejected the Word of the Lord. Christ tells us, <HI>he that looks upon a Woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her in his heart.</HI> Hear what account God makes of that which you call a look, a cast of the eye, a little thing. <HI>Isa.</HI> 3.16, 17.</P>
<P N="4">4. The more madness to break with God, and expose your Souls to Hell Torment for these things, that had but a little of pleasure to entice. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 13.19.</P>
<P N="5">5. Little Sins make way for greater. One Sin allowed, stupifies and makes way for great ones; the greatest Sinner began with that which you call little. <HI>Eve</HI> first saw that the tree was good: <HI>Cain</HI> was first wroth with <HI>Abel,</HI> and then slew him.</P>
<P N="3">3. Some are arguing thus; God is long-suf|fering and patient; no hazzard of present dan|ger. <HI>Eccles.</HI> 11.8. If God strike Sinners dead
<PB N="43" REF="000902_0041_0FAC9C542321D5E0">
presently, they should be afraid to put off Re+pentance; but God waits and forbears; he waited long on the Old World, on <HI>Sodom,</HI> on many wicked men of old; they don't doubt but God will yet wait on them, they see no appearance of wrath as yet: to this, Consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. Is not this to despise the riches of Gods Grace and Patience, <HI>to the treasuring up wrath a|gainst the day of wrath,</HI> Rom. 2.4, 5. can't you be content without a treasure of wrath? that you can find in your heart thus to delay Re|pentance.</P>
<P N="2">2. God did not exercise any patience towards the Fallen Angels, and he is under no obligati|on to exercise any towards you. <HI>Iude</HI> 6. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.5. What reason can you give why God should wait any longer on you? can you do him more Services? God is very arbitrary in his waiting, longer or shorter on Sinners.</P>
<P N="3">3. God doth not ordinarily wait so long on Gospel Sinners. <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.28 no Sinners ripen sooner for cutting down in vengeance than Gospel Sinners. God makes very quick work with some. <HI>Acts</HI> 13.46. how quick and sudden was God with <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira</HI>?</P>
<P N="4">4. God threatens to make quick work with them that harden themselves in Sins, in hopes of long-suffering. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 12.27, 28. So that you have no security in putting off repentance; its very hazzardous.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="44" REF="000902_0042_0FAC9C54E220B5A8">4. Some will reason thus with themselves. God is very gracious and merciful, and pardons great Sins, and Sinners. God pardoned <HI>Manas|seh,</HI> and <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> and other great Sin|ners: If God had not proclaimed his Name to be gracious and merciful, <HI>slow to anger, &amp; forgiving Iniquity, Transgression and Sin,</HI> they should be afraid of delaying repentance; but inasmuch as God is so very merciful, they hope it will be no ve|ry hard thing to perswade him to pardon after|wards. To this consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That he is a just and righteous God too, and pardons no Sinners but such as are penitent; it's true, God gives great Sinners encouragement to turn to him; and upon their repentance, <HI>he will forgive their iniquities, yea multiply to pardon</HI>; but remember he is a just God too; when he proclaims his Name with so much encourage|ment to repenting Sinners, he subjoyns that he will not at all acquit the guilty. <HI>Nahum.</HI> 1.3. as merciful as God is, he will not shew mercy and grace to the wronging and injuring of his Justice.</P>
<P N="2">2. You take a course to be shut out of all mercy, and to have God appear shutting up all bowels, and pitty from you. <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.19. Such reasonings are to be abominated. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.1. sure|ly you turn the grace of God to wantonness; when you improve it to encourage you on in ways of sin and rebellion.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="45" REF="000902_0043_0FAC9C55A66CFD88">5. Some plead for themselves, that they are weak and ignorant; God hath not given them muck knowledge as others; wherefore their sin is not so provoking to God, as the sins of them that have more knowledge; they hope God will pity their weakness, and not be so very se|vere with them.</P>
<P N="1">1. One sin won't excuse you for another; a gracious act presently after a sinful one, will not excuse you before God; surely the pleading of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat which is a sin, will be no security for a sin. It's true, the more any sin against knowledge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he more aggravated is their sin; but ignorance is no defence against Gods anger; especially in such as you that have had your Education in <HI>New-England,</HI> under the plain convincing preaching of the Gospel. You must of necessity have re|fused to attend to the Word preached, that re|main ignorant, as to the plain principles of Re|ligion; you must have set at nought Gods Counsels, and closed and shut your own eyes. What excuse will it be for you? if you are willingly ignorant; you did not see, because you shut your eyes, and would not.</P>
<P N="2">2. You know that such and such courses that you allow you selves in, are sins; and so your sins are not from weakness, but wilfulness. You know that Whoredom is a sin; that prophaning Gods Sabbaths is a sin, that Unbelief is a sin. You can't plead ignorance here.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="46" REF="000902_0044_0FAC9C5661BB0668">3. God hath declared that your ignorance &amp; weakness shall be no expiation of his wrath? <HI>Isa.</HI> 27.11. <HI>Hos.</HI> 4.6.</P>
<P N="6">6. You say, you don't make such a profession of Godliness as some others do; if you made a very great profession, and did such things, you are ready to think, God would be very angry; you do therefore condemn lesser evils in Church members, and admire how they can be so in|sensible.</P>
<P N="1">1. Sin will damn them that don't make a profession, as well as others. God will damn Heathen for their Impenitency, as well as Pro|fessors.</P>
<P N="2">2. You do so far make a profession, that your sin will be aggravated. You pray in your Families, come and joyn in prayer, and hearing the Word of God. You do many things, tho' not all commanded Duties; you profess so high, that your sin will cast you down as low as Hell, if you repent not.</P>
<P N="3">3. By these things you incapacitate your selves from making a suitable profession. Will saying that you lived in sins and wickedness, that rendered you unfit for respecting all Gods Commandments, prevent <HI>your being beaten with many stripes? Luk.</HI> 12.47.</P>
<P N="7">7. Some will say, that its not in their power to change their own hearts, and withstand temp|tation: If they had sinned after such a sort, &amp;
<PB N="47" REF="000902_0045_0FAC9C572207BF08">
had a power to have resisted temptations; they think God would have been very severe, but they can't change their own hearts.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because you can't do that which is not your work, and what you can't, won't you do what is your duty, and what you can? though you can't change your hearts, you can reform your life. Many that have no principle of grace, reform their lives.</P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis in your power not to run your selves into temptations, as you often do; you may as well on an evening, go into your Closet, and confess your sin, as go into bad company, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad places.</P>
<P N="3">3. 'Tis your sin and madness then to pro|voke God not to help you. Can't you repent of your selves? and will you run away from God, who only can? Will you sin away his help from you? He bids you turn, and he will pour out his Spirit: if you turn from him, and will not cherish the motions of his Spirit, you take a course to dye in your sins.</P>
<P N="8">8. 'Tis your grief and sorrow that you do sin. If you were not affected and sinned with|out remorse, you conclude, God would say, <HI>shall not my Soul be avenged on such a Sinner</HI>? But you are sorry, you confess your sins with tears; you can say you are grieved at heart for your sins, you hope God will not be so exact with you.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="48" REF="000902_0046_0FAC9C57F9FCCD88">1. Some are grieved and sorrowful, but 'tis for the shame and punishment of their sins: they acted as though they had no shame in them, when their sins were hid from man, but when men know of them, they grieve and are sorrow|ful. Shame and fear of punishment, not the Violation of Gods law is the moving cause of some men and womens grief and sorrow.</P>
<P N="2">2. Your grief and sorrow won't quench hell fire, nor wash away the stain of sin. If you cry night and day, and weep never so much; yea, you cover the Altar in this sense with tears, God won't regard: these are not the blood of Christ, <HI>which only cleanseth from iniquity.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Your sorrow and grief are but flattery &amp; dissimulation, so long as you take no heed to reform. You read of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> that they appeared to men to be sorrowful: yea of those whose <HI>Fasts God abhorred,</HI> though they made a very plausible show of sorrow, because they did not reform sayes God, <HI>Will you call this a fast? and an acceptable day to the Lord?</HI> Isa. 58&punc;3&mdash;8.</P>
<P N="9">9. You say, you were sollicited, drawn in, and over perswaded by others to these sins; if you had enticed others, you had been very much to blame; but for your part you had no intention, not a thought in your heart to do such wickedness; but others would give you no quiet till you make one with them, and so you impute it to your being good natured
<PB N="49" REF="000902_0047_0FAC9C58A2515EB0">
and willing to gratifie others, rather than to the enmity of your heart against God.</P>
<P N="1">1. Could they that enticed you, do as much for you, or against you, as God could? Surely if you use this reasoning to be looked upon to be good natured persons, you lay your selves o|pen to a just Censure for folly: Who that is wise will despise God, to please man?</P>
<P N="2">2. If you are so good natured, why don't you yield to God in his beseechings and entrea|ties? you are stubborn, wilful and stout enough here: How earnestly hath God invited you to come to him? he hath not failed in giving you suitable and proper encouragements; God hath stood long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntreating, many years called with all earnestness, &amp; sent by many to perswade you.</P>
<P N="3">3. Others could not make you yield, if Sin within did not entice you, to a giving a consent. <HI>Iam.</HI> 1.14. the Devil himself han't a power to make you yield; it may be you say, the Scrip|ture seems to carry it in the favour of the young man, spoken of, in <HI>Prov.</HI> 7.21. <HI>that she forced him.</HI> To that I say; you would do well to con|sider, that the Scripture relates it, as preparing him for such wickedness, and how fully he yielded; 'tis said, <HI>he was one void of understanding,</HI> one that had refused Christ as his Prophet, that would not come to him for <HI>Eye salve,</HI> and that he was out of his place, and idling away his time, seeking occasions of Sin; <HI>he was passing
<PB N="50" REF="000902_0048_0FAC9C5961B1E678">
through the Street, near her corner, and he went the way to her house</HI>; and then that he goes after her straightway, or suddenly as it may be rendred; she did not pull and drag him along, not forcibly drive him; but he comes after, not make a stand, a stop, or turn back; but goes after her straightway, and perseveres in the Sin.</P>
<P N="4">4. That God doth strike dead even such as these. <HI>Prov</HI> 7.23. God don't only take Venge|ance on them that entice, but on them that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re enticed. God gives you no reason by his deal|ings with such, to hope that you may escape unpunished.</P>
<P N="10">10. You say the days are such days of A|postacy, and the times so degenerate, that you should be a meer laughing stock if you did not sin; you are ready <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o say, that you have found, that the end of such mirth is heaviness: Con|science hath galled, accused &amp; condemned you for them; but if you did decline wanton ex|pressions and gestures, you should make your selves a prey; others would censure you as sil|ly creatures, not fit for Society; if others would reform, you would be glad to reform; but as things are circumstanced, you are afraid to re|form.</P>
<P N="1">1. Better Sinners laugh at you here, than God laugh at you for ever. <HI>God will be ashamed of them that are ashamed of Him, before an Adulterous
<PB N="51" REF="000902_0049_0FAC9C5A21D96F90">
and Wicked Generation: God will have them in Derision: Yea, he will laugh at their Cala|mity, and mock when their fear cometh as deso|lation</HI>; that on such pretences <HI>set at nought his Counsel. Prov.</HI> 1.26. You are afraid sinners will laugh at you, and count you a silly Creature: you take a direct course to be a fool for ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. Others have kept from Sin under greater Temptations. <HI>Moses, Ioseph, Lot, Daniel,</HI> and the three Children.</P>
<P N="3">3. It would be no damage but a benefit to get rid of such Company, whose favour you think to lose The Psalmist says, <HI>Depart from me you wicked men, I will keep the commands of my God. Moses counted the reproach of Christ greater riches than all the pleasures and treasures of Egypt.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. It may be your Conversion might be an occasion, not only of the Reformation, but sound Conversion of many others. It may be your being so concerned for Christ, may cause them to say, <HI>O thou fairest among women! Whither is thy beloved gone, that we may go and seek him with you? Cant.</HI> 6.1. It may be you may make them ashamed, that falsly accuse your good Conver|sation: you are not sure you shall be reproach|ed by any.</P>
<P N="5">5. Your Conversion to God will rejoyce ma|ny. God, Christ, your Godly Relations, and Ministers, will be glad and rejoyce. <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.32. 2 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 4. &amp; 3 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 3.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="52" REF="000902_0050_0FAC9C5AE142C928">11. You say you are not convinced that such and such things are Sins, you see no great harm in them; God prospers you in such wayes, if you really thought them to be sins, you would reform: You have heard such Unclean words and gestures reproved in the Pulpit, but you are not of the Ministers mind&punc; you have known others that have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led from such things, have been Afflicted, and you have been Pros|pered.</P>
<P N="1">1. You don't bring your deeds to the light to know what they are, that it may be made manifest what they are; you might have been Convinced. Your refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to try your actions, renders it suspicious that you have a Secret jea|lousy they are naught; you would not willing|ly know them to be sins <HI>Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> 3.20.</P>
<P N="2">2. You have often from the Ministry been warned of such courses, and have heard them condemned from Scripture arguments; your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aying, you are not of the Ministers mind, who cites Scripture for what he layes down, whilst you refuse to search with the <HI>Bereans,</HI> whether the things be so or no, will be no plea for you.</P>
<P N="3">3. Your own consciences have accused you for these things, when you have looke upon Death to be near; when you are well, your love to your l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sts, puts a new darkness upon your judgments, that were before corrupted by the fall.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="53" REF="000902_0051_0FAC9C5BA161CAA8">4. Outward Prosperity is no argument that your ways are good.

<P N="12">12. You say your Sins are Secret from the eyes of the world, and you were never left a|bove once to be actually and grosly Unclean. If you had been an open sinner, one addicted to wayes of Filthiness, you think God would be very angry: but you sinned but once, you hope God will over look that, and pass it by.</P>
<P N="1">1. God that is to be your Judge sees in Se|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et, and will Damn for Secret Sins: Secret Sins will Damn you as well as open. Christ denounced woes against <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> for Secret sins. <HI>God will bring every Secret thing into Iudgment. Eccl.</HI> 12.14.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Adam</HI> by one act of disobedience was shut out of Paradise: the Angels thrust out of Hea|ven.</P>
<P N="3">3. One act of these Sins may fill up the mea|sure of other sins. <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira</HI> they fill'd up the measure of sin in <HI>Lying</HI>: one of these sins don't go alone; many other sins pre|pare and make way for them.</P>

<P N="2">2. It may be God may come upon you with a sudden destruction, that you may never come on a Sick-bed. Who can tell what a morrow may produce! When you think Death farthest off, and promise your selves years, God may say, <HI>Fools, this night shall your Souls be required.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. You say you saw religious and good men do such things, and therefore you appre|hend no great harm in them, surely they would never have done such things, if there had been so much provocation, and therefore so much hazzard in them.</P>
<P N="1">1. It may be they were only Hypocrites that you saw act so: So was <HI>Iudas,</HI> so was <HI>Demas,</HI> so the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> that were had in such Ve|neration for their Sanctitie.</P>
<P N="2">2. You are to follow none only wherein they follow Christ. Good men are not the rule you are to walk by. Consider how the Prophet was punished that was deluded, upon a Pro|phets suggesting to him, that an Angel had so spoken to him. 1 <HI>King.</HI> 13.13.</P>

Decree bring forth. You have stood before an Earthly Tribunal, and are found guilty; How will you stand before the Tribunal of Christ? to answer for all your sins? your day of Grace is almost gone, and within a few hours, you will either be in Heaven or Hell. Oh! now turn to God, or you will never. I would offer some things to your consideration, for your convicti|on of guiltiness, and need you have to get your peace made with God. You are by nature, a Child of Wrath, and guilty of <HI>Adams</HI> Sin; you brought a guilty, defiled Soul into the world with you: <HI>You were shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did your Mother conceive you.</HI> You have long re|fused and slighted Jesus Christ, and would none of him as your Prophet, your Priest, and your King, and so are under a Sentence of Death, from the Gospel, as well as the Law; by your unbelief you have sealed down the Wrath of God upon your own Soul; you have fallen al|so into great Land-polluting moral evils, Lying, Stealing, Adultery, and Murder. You would not hearken to the voice of your eminently pi|ous Father in law, warning of you. You have accustomed your self to these ways of sin, tho' you Lived under the convincing preaching of the Gospel. You closed your eyes, and would not see, tho' for many years you Lived under an eminently Soul-searching Ministry; &amp; you have given up your self to these sins in the day
<PB N="57" REF="000902_0055_0FAC9C5EA231D860">
that God was pleading his Controversie, and hedging up your ways with thorns; in the day of the Lords anger, you have sinned more and more: when God had driven you out of one Plantation, into another, by the Enemy; when God had taken away your first Husband by Death, and suffered your second to be carried into Captivity; when he was in bondage, you were wantonly doting on your Lovers; yea though you could not look out at your door, but the Garrison and Souldiers before your eyes proclaimed it to be a day of Gods anger; your sin is very great, in your violating your Marri|age Covenant. You have relapsed after God filled your Soul with horror for these abomina|tions, and turned again as a <HI>Sow that was wash|ed, to her wallowing in the mire</HI>&punc; You refused to be prevented from Murder, by covering your Adultery with lying, though so solemnly admo|nished and cautioned. You have unnaturally murdered the fruit of your own body, &amp; what in you lay its Soul; have abused patience and long suffering exercised towards you of God; multiplying lying, and hardening your heart, &amp; have not feared God, being under a righteous Condemnation, and Sentence of Death; but to this day continued in lying. You have slighted the Word of God, quenched the Spirit of God, refused Christ; and have by these things filled up the measure of your sins; so that you must Dye, that the Land be not guilty: None may
<PB N="58" REF="000902_0056_0FAC9C5F68628810">
stay you from death, and suffer you to live; least the Land be greatly polluted. And you are now Enjoying your last Opportunity in Gods House; you that have idled, slept away, yea whored away part of so many Sabbaths and Lectures, shall have no more. You that have disregarded Gods Counsels, how righteously might God say? <HI>I will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear comes..</HI> Yet he sayes after all these things, <HI>turn,</HI> Jer. 3.7&punc; For the life of your body, your case is hopeless. Your sin is so heinous, that your life can't be saved with|out injustice. Well then, since you can't live guiltless, labour to die penitent; &amp; since your Body can't be saved alive, endeavour that your Soul may be saved alive in death; there is yet a possibility that your Soul may be saved. See <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.20, 22, 23, 24. Jesus Christ the essential wisdom, calls after such an one as you, to come to him; though you have been long sinning, lov'd, and delighted in sinning; yea, tho' you have hated knowledge, you are called upon, &amp; encouraged to come. God in Christ is shewing how ready he is to show you <HI>mercy</HI> upon your repentance, and to help you in your repentance, he offers you the best help, and help suitable. Oh then come away to Jesus Christ now; lest upon your refusal, the after verses be made good against your Soul.</P>
<P><HI>Direction.</HI> Come away to Christ now upon
<PB N="59" REF="000902_0057_0FAC9C602120BA68">
the call and encouragement of the Gospel. Stay away no longer: Don't think your Prayers, good promise&punc; and others praying for you, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave you. But hasten away to Christ: <HI>There is no other Name given, whereby you can be saved. Act.</HI> 4.12. And no other way of being saved by Christ, <HI>than by coming to him, or believing on him.</HI> You are called this day in an Ordinance of Christ to come for Reconciliation. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19. Christ came to save guilty sinners: <HI>Its a faithful saying and worthy of your acceptation, that Christ came into the World to save Sinners, chief of Sinners.</HI> The greatest sinners have been justified in this way. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.11. So <HI>Manasseh</HI> that shed much inno|cent blood.</P>
<P><HI>Consider,</HI> for your encouragement, that Christ fully accepts of them that ran far from him, that refused to come as long as they could re|tain any hopes of being saved in any other way, upon their coming to him. <HI>Luke</HI> 15. God won't upbraid you upon your coming. <HI>Iam.</HI> 1.5. Yea, <HI>he that comes unto me I will in no wise cast out</HI>; though he have been a great and an old Sinner, though he have sinned away many Convictions, yet if he come he shall have mercy. Christ Jesus calls you to come; not to sell you pardon, but give you Grace. <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.29. <HI>I will give you rest.</HI> Christ aimes at your pre|sent gain, and not at his own: and therefore if you have no money, yet you may have the mercy you want. <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.1.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="000902_0058_0FAC9C60E1EAA1E8"><HI>Consider.</HI> 1. That Christ don't call you to come to him to be Punished, but Pardoned. Christ in the Gospel comes to you to save you, calls you to come to him, to be pardoned. Its true, if you refuse the calls of Christ in this life, he will call you in the next life to be punished, and condemned. Oh! Christ calls you, and you need not be afraid to come to him now; for he doth not call you to come to be punished for sins already committed; but that he may pardon and forgive them, blot o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the hand-writing of Ordinances that was a|gainst you. May you have a free and full par|don of so many and great sins upon coming? then delay no longer.</P>
<P N="2">2. Jesus Christ calls you to come, not to pass a Sentence of Death upon you; but to take it off from you: There will be no Condemnation against your Soul, when once you are gotten into Christ. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1. yea, Christ says, such shall not enter into Condemnation; <HI>for they are passed from death to life</HI>; there is a sentence of death gone out against you in the Law, &amp; 'tis a holy and righteous sentence too; now the Gospel offers no mercy, to the repealing and taking off this Sentence of Condemnation with|out coming to Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. Christ calls you to come to him, not to shut you up in the Prison of Hell, but to set you at liberty. Oh! Christ would bring you
<PB N="61" REF="000902_0059_0FAC9C61A7B880B8">
out of the pit, wherein is no water; for Christ received a Commission from the Father to pro|claim liberty, <HI>and the opening of the prison doors, to them that are shut up,</HI> Isa&punc; 61.1, 2. the prison and dungeon of Hell is the place you will assu|redly be shut up in, if you stay away from Christ; <HI>but the Son will set you at liberty,</HI> if you come to him; who don't chuse liberty and en|largement before prisons and dungeons?</P>
<P N="4">4. Christ calls you not to feed you with the bread and water of Affliction, but to feast you. <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.20. <HI>Luk</HI> 15.23. Here's bread, <HI>which if you eat of you shall never hunger</HI>: Is not bread to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he hungry Soul desireable? Why should you stay away, when you are ready to perish with hunger? Christ Jesus will feast you, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you come to him. Christ hath Spiritual delicacies to en|tertain you withal.</P>
<P N="5">5. Jesus Christ don't call you to cloath you with Raggs, and bring you to shame and dis|grace, but to cloath you with his righteousness. Christ won't take away any thing that is good and desireable, and worth keeping&punc; but to give you Grace and Glory: Nor to speak angrily, but to speak comfortably to you; not to put you to drudgery, and ignominious service for ever; but to stand before him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> do him Ser|vice, in Praising and Glorifying his Name. See what you are counsel'd to come to Christ for. <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.18.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="62" REF="000902_0060_0FAC9C626246B820">1. Come to him for that which he came in|to the World for, to be your Sanctifier; to have Sin taken away; that he would give you repen|tance. <HI>Christ is Exalted at the right hand of the Father, to give repentance unto Israel, and remission of sins. God hath sent him to bless his people in turning them from their iniquities.</HI> His Name is <HI>IESUS,</HI> and he will Save them that come unto him from their sins. You want Christ for this, how can you else think of going into the holy Heavens? <HI>Nothing that defiles enters there: Without Holiness you can't see God.</HI> Oh! then let that be upon your Soul, to have Christ for Sanctification.</P>
<P N="2">2. Come to him as a poor guilty, polluted Creature: come therefore self Condemned: They that come because they have made so many Prayers, and have gotten something good, are not like to be accepted. Remember the poor <HI>Publican, that went down to his house justify|ed; he was one that smites upon his breast, the Lord be merciful to me a Sinner</HI>; he don't say, be mer|ciful to me, who was once a great Sinner, but I have reformed my life&punc; I have made many an affectionate prayer, I have taken a great deal of pains; but he comes as <HI>guilty,</HI> sayes not a word to justify himself. So the <HI>Prodigal,</HI> when he comes home, he comes judging &amp; condemn|ning himself for what he had done, that he was so guilty, that God might now justly put him by, he does not say, I did displease, but I

have now done something to turn away thine anger, and to procure thy favour. See what he sayes. <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.18, 19, 21. And yet see what wellcome he met with. <HI>Verse</HI> 22. And don't you think to go because you have sorrowed, mourn|ed, and kept from Sinful courses. See how <HI>David</HI> went to God. <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.3, 4.</P>
<P N="3">3. Come as a helpless, shiftless, lost Crea|ture. Oh! Consider <HI>that in him the Fatherless findeth Mercy:</HI> As one that must have all from Christ. Oh! go to him as one that is lost, and knows not what to do of your self. <HI>Christ came to seek and save the lost.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Justifie God in all his comminations, threat|nings and curses against sin, and sinners&punc; So did <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 51.4.</P>
<P N="5">5. Come to him from the encouragements of the Gospel, from what encouragements Christ gives you in his Word; not because you have gotten a heart to hate sin, love God; or because you are not quite so bad as you have been.</P>
<P N="6">6 Come to him to be Saved from the wick|edness of your heart. Oh that you may be Sa|ved from the unbelief, hypocrisie, worldliness, hardness and carnality of your heart. So did <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 51.1. <HI>Create in me a clean heart.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Come to him with a desire to be put into his Service, to do work for him; so did the Prodigal; <HI>make me as one of thy hired Servants.</HI> You will say, what work can I do? that am

just going out of the world. Oh consider, that you may Serve Christ, in making confession of you sin, warning of others, justifying God; oh come away, consider that Christ will call to you from off the Mercy Seat no more after a few hours; if you refuse now, how will you dare to make your appearance before the Throne of Justice? If you are afraid to come to Christ so affectionately calling you to come to him, where he is Sitting on his Throne of Mercy, &amp; holding forth the Scepter of Divine Grace? Oh! Come; behold now, even now, is yet an accepted time. Come, and give your self to Jesus Christ. Oh! Lift up your heart to God, to draw you, to turn you; and we will lift up our hearts and desires to God with you, and for you, that he would draw and turn you.</P>
