<P>_I AM fully persuaded, that I cannot furnish my Friends and Countrymen with a more agreeable Entertainment, than in acquainting them with what w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s done by the Merchants in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> who tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de to <HI>Maryland</HI> and <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI> whilst I stayed there, for the Relief of our most deplorable Trade.

tho' those Endeavours were attended with some Dif|ficulties, which were chiefly occasioned by the Dif|fidence they had in one another; (for which they all complained there was too much Reason, from the Experience of their former Meetings, when the Measures then concerted, and Agreements made, were continually broke thro', whereby those who intented honestly to keep them were the Sufferers, and the Trangressors not only run away with the present Ad|vantage there, but also with the Applause and En|couragement from hence) Yet, as this seemed to be the chief Objection, it was at length removed, by re|presenting to them the Necessity they were under, to make one more Experiment, in hopes that Agreements would now be better kept than they have been here|tofore; or that such Persons who would not come into, or bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k Measures, after they had agreed to them, would certainly be here distinguished, and thereby occasion them to suffer in their Interest: But above all, by the assiduous Endeavours of Mr. <HI>Iohn Falconar,</HI> who seconded my Attempt very vigorously, and took true Pains to get them together, which was at length effected; and, upon the Seventh Day of <HI>March</HI> last, I had the Pleasure to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> present with all the Gentlemen in our Trade&punc; (excepting Two or Thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that were either out of Town&punc; or out of Order) When the first Thing agreed upon, was, a Resolution to have regular &amp; constant Meetings once every Month; after That was concluded, They came to a Resolution to continue the former Charge of 3 Pence <HI>per</HI> Hogshead, and to have all Arrears of that Charge duly collected, which had been for some Time neglected and omitted.

to put my Thoughts in Writing, which I now offer to the Committee, for their Correction, Approbation or Re|jection; which Last shall not at all displease me. I aim at nothing but the Good of the Trade in general, in which every Man's particular Good is included: Therefore, if the End aimed at be but obtained, I shall be very Thankful to any Gentleman, for communicating his Thoughts, tho' never so different from mine: So with|out farther Apology will come to my Matter.</HI></P>
<P>IT is well known to us all, that the chief Cause of the Depression of the Trade, is from the great Ascendant the <HI>French</HI> Agent has got over us, which Ascendant is very natural; For, he being but One, and so very considerable a Buyer, must have a great Advantage over so many Sellers, acting with|out any manner of Consultation, or Agreement a|mong our selves: Whereas, did we act in Concert, we might make our selves equal to him, and so keep up Tobacco at a living Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, which is all I aim at. I am by no Means for running up Tobacco to an extravagant Price, or any other Way discouraging the <HI>French</HI> Trade, which is a valuable Consumption, and ought to be encouraged; but then it ought to be upon such Terms as the Planters and Others con|cern'd, may live by their Labour; which of late Years we know they have not done, &amp; all along with the <HI>French</HI> Agents&punc; who, every one of them, in their turns, have been (properly speaking) Sellers as well as Bavers: It has not been what Price we pleas'd, but They that have set the Price, and we could not help our selves, which has been of the worse Con|sequence, because all other Buyers govern them|selves by what Price the <HI>French</HI> Agent gives; so that the good or ill Fortune of the Trade, depends altoge|ther upon what Measures we take with the <HI>French.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">de of <HI>Fran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> is in a Company, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> what Price they please upon what they sell
<PB N="7" REF="003017_0006_0FEFA0691E3CE3F8">
to their own People, or rather have a fixed Price, from which they do not vary, let them buy Tobac|co here never so cheap; and as they constantly em|ploy but one Agent at one Time, I think we might fall into a Method, so to incorporate our selves, as to treat as one Man with that Agent, for fixing the Price for such a Time as may be thought convenient; and so from Time to Time, to rise or fall the Price as the Circumstances of the Trade may require; which I wish to be done with all Civility, by Way of Contract, with the <HI>French</HI> Agent, by a Committee of the Trade specially appointed for that Purpose, at a General Meeting: And when the Time contracted for, is expired, or near expiring, then the same (or a new Committee) may be appointed, after Consulta|tion in the General Meeting, to renew the old, or make a new Contract, according to what shall be agreed upon by a Majority in the General Meeting. I cannot but think the <HI>French</HI> Agent, would willing|ly come into such a Method, as it would make Things easy to him; and being done by Treaty with him|self, will not look like Compulsion: As the Price will then be fixed and known, every Body will far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> alike, and the <HI>French</HI> Gentleman will then have no|thing to do, but please himself with the Quality of the Tobacco.</P>
<P>THIS Agreement I think ought only to be for <HI>Iames River</HI> Tobacco, which is almost only proper for the <HI>French</HI> Market, and such Part of <HI>Maryland</HI> Tobacco as is likewise proper for the <HI>French</HI> Market.</P>
<P>AS for all other Sorts of <HI>Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ko</HI> Tobacco, I think the Price cannot be fixed other, than that I think some certain Price ought to be fix'd for a cer|tain Time; within which Time, no Tobacco, even the worst of Scrubs, should be sold under that Price: Not that I suppose we may obtain such a Price for ordinary Scrubs; but I think it will be the Interest
<PB N="8" REF="003017_0007_0FEFA0409ADF97C8">
of the Trade to have a Price fixed, below which, no Tobacco shall be sold, without Consent of a General Meeting.</P>
<P>I do not think it reasonable to attempt debarring the <HI>French</HI> Agent from Buying whole Ships Loads, or any Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cel of Tobacco, not proper for the <HI>French</HI> Trade&punc; in that he ought to have his Liberty equal with other Buyers.</P>
<P>BUT I think 'twill absolutely be our Interest to Sort our Tobacco; and what is specially proper for the <HI>French</HI> Consumption, not to sell that under the Price contracted for with the <HI>French</HI> Agent: If he will buy other Sortments, the Price must be govern'd by what other Buyers will give; only remembring to sell no Tobacco unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Price fix'd for Scrubs.</P>
<P>HAVING now spoke my Mind, as to what is pro|per to be done respecting the <HI>French,</HI> shall come to what immediately respects our selves, as a Society; in which I am in some Measure prevented by the good Harmony that appeared at last General Meet+ing, in which Meeting a Foundation was laid for (I hope) a good Understanding in Future, by a|greeing upon Four Fundamentals, to a regular Socie|ty, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. THAT there shall be a General Meeting of all the Trade, once in every Month, therein to con|sult upon what may concern the Trade. I am glad so commendable a Method is revived, and shall be heartily glad it may never more be discontinued: The only Seeing and Conversing with one another, may be of Advantage; but more Benefits may be ex|pected from the collective Body of the Trade, will they agree upon some certain Rules to proceed by.</P>
<P>ONE of the Chief, I think to be, That all Matters in Debate, be decided by a Majority of Voices; without that, we shall be a mere <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lish</HI> Diet, which seldom e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds but in Confusion: A b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re Majority may be thought too strict, but I am content so a Majority
<PB N="9" REF="003017_0008_0FEFA0712D148AE8">
do but decide how the Majority be limited, whether to two Thirds, or three Quarters of the Whole; and sure if so great a Part sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld be of one Mind, the re|maining Third or Quarter, will acquiesce, so far as passively, to comply with what shall be determined.</P>
<P>BUT if some particular Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bers will not agree, neither actively nor passively, or after Agreement shall break thro' Engagements. I would not have that disolve the General Agreement, but that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Majority may still keep together, true to their En|gagements one to another: If that could be ac|complished, I am of Opinion the Refractory would in Time see their Error, and find it their Interest to join themselves to the Body; for, in Time, the Ma|jority will certainly gain the Victory, and govern the Trade.</P>
<P>BUT if some Particulars, for private Interest, or Humour, will not come into Society, or break A|greements after made, I think the Majority should, in Justice to themselves and their Employers, ac|quaint the Gentlemen of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland</HI> what they have done, and intended to do, for Ad|vancement of the Trade; but that they are obstructed by such and such, (mentioning the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts,) and de|siring their Assistance to prevail with such Persons to join with the Generality: Our Principals are so sensible what they have suffered by our Disagree|ment, that I make no doubt they will find out better Methods than we can, to make us Unanimous. As I would have This one of the Preliminaries of our Set|tlement, as well as carrying by Majority of Voices, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> can&punc; in reason, be offended; because, if the Committee be of Opinion to report to the Ge|nerality these Two Particulars to be a proper Foun|dation of Society, and the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be agreed to by the Generality, then it will be a Law of every Body's making; and so no Person ought to find Fault with what they themselves have assented to.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="003017_0009_0FEFA082B82B45C0">II. THE second Thing agreed to at last Meeting, was, The Continuing Three Pence <HI>per</HI> Hogshead on all Tobacco, which I very much approve of&punc; with|out such a Fund we shall not be able to defend our selves against many Incroachments, or Hardships, that may be offered (as in Times past) to be afresh put upon the Trade: That Duty has been a Means of uniting us so, as to ward off Foreign Evils that af|fected us only in common with our Fellow Subjects; but henceforward I hope a Part of that Duty will be employed so, as to ward off Evils immediately relating to our selves, by begetting a friendly Acquaintance and Society, towards which, Monthly Meetings will very much conduce.</P>
<P>AND therefore I propose Two or Three Gui|neas be appropriated to defray the Charge of each Monthly Meeting: And, supposing so much may not be actually spent at each Meeting, I wish all the Savings may be kept distinct by it self; and when it amounts to a Sum sufficient, may be bestowed upon a Dinner, once or twice a Year, for the whole Trade. What I am at by this, is to beget a good Friendship and Harmony among the Merchants; which Eating together, does more often produce among Mankind, than bare Drinking.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE third Thing agreed at last Meeting, was, Continuing our Treasurer, Alderman <HI>Perry,</HI> than whom I think we cannot have a better.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE Fourth was Confirming the former Ma|nagers, and filling up the Number to Twelve in all. This I think is a very good Part towards a regular Society, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they are a Controul upon the Treasurer, for all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> expended, and are a sort of Guardians for the Trade, to watch against all Foreign Attacks.</P>
<P>BUT, in my Opinion, they may be made still more useful, were they appointed to take the imme|diate Care of the Trade into their Thoughts: And, for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, to have fix'd Meeting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> every Fortnight,
<PB N="11" REF="003017_0010_0FEF962201890930">
between the Monthly Meeting, and so make Report to the General Meeting, and their Expences to be allowed&punc; so that the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me do not exceed one Gui|nea each Meeting, or Twelve Guineas <HI>per Annum</HI>; and the Savings to be expended once or twice a Year in a Dinner for the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nagers. I am the more for Eating as well as Drinking, in our Society, in hopes Conversation may unite us in Affection as well as in Interest, and then our Work will be easy.</P>
<P>BUT, I am of Opinion, there is one Thing still wanting to cement us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rer together, and without which I am afraid we shall grow cool and negligent, as in Times past: What I mean, is a proper Person for a Secretary, one that should be a common Ser|v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to the Trade&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd have a S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lary for so doing, paid out of the Publick Stock. I think we cannot employ our Money better, and such a Person m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve full Employment; for I would have him attend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et|ings of the Trade, take Minutes, &amp; keep the Records in good Method, he might collect the Three Pence <HI>per</HI> Hogshead, and pay it to the Treasurer; and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny other Things m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y fall under his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, some of them occuring to my present Thoughts I shall mention, <HI>vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></P>
<P>I think he should keep an exact Account of all Tobacco imported into <HI>London,</HI> and also of all Ex|ports or Sales that (at a View) we may at any Time know what Tobacco is at Market.</P>
<P>THE like I think we should have from all the Out-Ports in <HI>Grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-Britain,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich may be obtained by settling a Correspondent in every Port, to trans|mit Accounts thereof (by Post) to our Secretary, and he to record them in Books for that Purpose, to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> before the Managers at their Meetings.</P>
<P>I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> also wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld be mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h for our Government, had we a Regist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r kept of all Ships bound to <HI>Vir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> with the Time of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Departure from all the Out-Ports, as well as <HI>London,</HI> which may be transmitted to our Secretary.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003017_0011_0FEF9FF5B365DE10">BY knowing what Tobacco there is upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and at any Time, and the Number and Burthen of Ships gone out for the ensuing Year, we shall be enabled the better to judge what Measures to take in respect to the Price.</P>
<P>WE might also settle a good Correspondency with the Merchants in the Out-Ports, by communi|cating Thoughts and Advice, by Letters directed to each Port, prepared by our Secretary, and Signed by some of the Managers, or by their Direction, only by the Secretary, who must keep Copies of them&punc; and all Letters from the Out-Ports, to be directed to the Secretary, to be by him communicated to the Ma|nagers.</P>
<P>I think we should, as a Body, settle a Correspon|dency with our Principals. I know not how it is in <HI>Virginia,</HI> but in <HI>Maryland</HI> I am told there are settled Clubs in every County, where they talk over Affairs. With these Clubs, I think would be our mutual In|terest to communicate Councils. I make no doubt what Advice they should have from us, as a Body, would have a great Weight to remedie many Evils we have long complained of, which only lies in Their Power to cure; as, mending the Quality, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">essening the Quantity of Tobacco, giving the Ships better Disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tch, and better Freight too; which I am hopeful they would not begrudge, when they saw us so much in Earnest to adv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce Tobacco, and put the Trade upon such a Foot as they may live comfortably by their Labour. I make no doubt when they feel the good Effects of our Agreement, they will think it unreasonable we should be so gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Sufferers by our Ship<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we have been of lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Years, which put nothing in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> it has taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of ours, and chiefly by the unaccountable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> extra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt Charge in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">: The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> been many Ways to their Detriment as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as our<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the Tobacco spoilt by

It is a melancholly Consideration, how much Money has been lost to <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Ma|ryland,</HI> by the low Price of Tobacco for some Years past; which, in a great Measure is owing to our Disagreement.</P>
<P>I am not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> many Objections may be made to what I now propose&punc; As, That the <HI>French</HI> will be out of Humour, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd so go to the Out Ports for Tobacco, which will give those Ports the Opportu|nity of cleaning their Hands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> burthened with a Lord upon our Hands; I know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> prove so: Even allowing that, I think we should try the Expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.

Gentlemen of the Out-Ports find such a Demand come upon them, they will know how to make use of it; and the more, that their To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acco is mostly their own Property.</P>
<P>BUT, on the other Side, we know the <HI>French</HI> cannot supply themselves at the Out-Ports with the Quantity they want; nor in Quality equal to To|bacco at <HI>London.</HI> But should they drain the Out-Ports, I fancy that would be an Advantage to us, we shall in that Case have the <HI>Dutch</HI> Market all to our selves&punc; which may more than make us Amends. But as I do not propose ever to run Tobacco up to very high Prices, I cannot see what should induce the <HI>French</HI> to desert <HI>London</HI>; No, not for a Time. They can be served so well no where else.</P>
<P>BUT to provide against the worst (expecting a Stop may happen for a Time, and may be inconve|nient to some of our Number to keep their Tobacco look'd up so long,) I think 'twill be the publick In|terest to supply any such Person with what Sums of Money may be absolutely necessary for them; which may be done without any Charge or Hazard to the Body of the Trade, who I would have be the Len|ders, upon Security of the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bacco; the Borrowers to pay the Interest: Which Money may be raised by a voluntary Subscription among the Trade, and deposited in one, two, or three Hands, as shall be agreed upon&punc; to be lent out in their Joynt Names to the Borrower, upon giving them Security upon their Tobacco, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e as shall be agreed be|tween the Lenders and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

<P>AT present I call not to mind farther, than that I think 'twill be very much for the Good of the Trade, that every Body refrain from sending Tobacco to <HI>Holland</HI> for Sale, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>Dutch</HI> come here for it. There is a great Difference between us that are Im|porters upon other People's Accounts, sending To|bacco to <HI>Holland,</HI> and such as buy it here to make their Money of it again: Such if they have (as they will have) the Market in their own Power, if we forbear sending, will be careful how they part with their Tobacco without Profit, the End of Trade.</P>
<P>THOUGH I was not forward in last General Meeting, to declare my Sentiments, yet now (to this Committee,) I have been very frank and open, submitting all to your Correction&punc; and wishing e|very Gentleman will as freely declare his Mind, that out of the Whole something may be digested, to be reported to the General Meeting, as necessary to be come into, for advancing the Trade, which is only what I have at Heart.</P>

<P>FOR the orderly conducting our Meetings, in every one of them, I think there should be a Chair|man; and as there are Twelve Managers appointed, one of them may be the President in the Monthly Meetings; and so, by Rotation, may go thro' all the Managers in a Year.</P>
<P>AND as I propose the Managers to have a Meet|ing between such Monthly Meeting, which I will call the Two Weeks Meeting&punc; He that was Chair|man of the last Monthly Meeting, to be Chairman of the next Two Weeks Meeting following that.</P>
<P>TO keep us together, I propose that every Mer|chant, at his Signing the Articles, deposit with the Treasurer, Three Pounds for the Use of the Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly Meeting. And that each of the Managers, at the same Time, deposit in the Hands of one of their own Number, to be chosen by Majority among them|selves. Thirty Shillings for the Use of their Meeting.</P>
<P>AS the First <HI>Thur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">day</HI> in every Month is already ap|pointed for the Monthly Meetings, so I would have the Hour of the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y also appointed; and every Per|son's Name that appears at each and every of those Meetings, be minuted down in the Book by the Se|cretary, those that c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me before the Hour, first, and under their Names a full Black Line to be drawn; and below th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery Man's N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me that comes into the Room <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fter the Hour appointed.</P>

<P>THESE Resolutions are (I believe) agreed upon by every Merchant in the Trade; whereby the Reader will see, that they are under good Re|gulations, for orderly and frequent Meetings; and I've very great Hopes, that those Meetings will be attended with very g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, tho' there was little more done when I left <HI>London,</HI> than appears by the foregoing Resolutions, unless it was the Set|tling a Salary of Forty Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> on Mr. <HI>Iohn Walkely,</HI> their Clerk, to be paid him out of the Publick Stock: And a positive Resolution and Agreement among them, that not any Tobacco, even the worst of Scrubs, should be Sold under Two Pence Half Penny per Pound.

of <HI>May</HI> following, Mr. <HI>Samuel Hyde,</HI> gave me a Project, that he had form'd to lay before that Meet|ing, which he apprehended would be very much for the good of the Trade, if it should be agreed to, which Project is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>THAT the Managers or any Five of them, be appointed to view every Loading of Tobacco, as soon as Landed, and before Sold.</P>
<P>THAT they sort the Tobacco according to its Nature as above described, <HI>viz.</HI> Three Sorts Colour and Dry Tobacco, Three Sorts Leaf, and and the very worst of all.</P>
<P>THAT the Manag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> report in Writing, the Quantity and Quality of each Ships Loading.</P>
<P>THAT the Merchant or Importer, be oblig'd to make good to the Proprietors of the Tobacco, the Price settled, and as much more as the To|bacco Sells for.</P>
<P>THAT the Tobacco now on hand, be view'd, sorted and valued by the Managers; and a Report thereof made to the next general Meeting.</P></Q>
<P>THESE Proposals were accordingly l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e the whole Body of the Trade, on the Second of <HI>May</HI>&punc; And by a Letter of that Day's Date from Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI> to me, which I received in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owns,</HI> he says,
<Q>That my Proposal, as it stands in Blank, was received and referred to the Consideration of the Managers, with less Opposition than I expected, tho' a great many Objections were raised, which
<PB N="29" REF="003017_0028_0FEFA091CD64D158">
I am sure I can answer. And therefore I desired the Gentlemen to take Copies, and hope they will gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e their Opinions in Writing. As we proceed, you shall be advised by the first Opportunity.</Q></P>
<P>THUS far are the Words of the aforesaid Letter; by which it appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, that this Project was referred to the Managers Consideration, to report their Opinion of it to the next General Meeting. I heartily wish Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, or something like it, may be agreed upon; it being, in my Opinion, the most effectual Method that can be thought of, to oblige every Body to keep Agreements, or to discover those that break thro' them: For, if this Method be agreed on, I know it is intended to send to the Collector or Naval Officer of e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery District, to be by him communicated to the Publick, an Account of the Value fix'd by the Trade on each sort of Tobacco; under which V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lue those Sorts must not be sold; and also the Mark and Num|bers of every Ship's Loading; with a particular Ac|count how the Managers that were the Viewers, have sorted it&punc; by which Means every one will see what Sortment his Tobacco is in; and will know that such a Sortment must not be sold under such a certain Price; whereby it will be easy to discover whether each Man's Correspondent complies with that Agree|ment, or not. This would therefore be full as effec|tual a Way to discover whether Agreements were kept or not, and who the Transgressors are, in case of their breaking Measures; as That which was proposed in Mr. <HI>Fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onar</HI>'s Representation, and the Committee's Report of jointly writing and informing us, who broke Measures, or would not come into A|greements; which was rejected by the Body of the Trade: And without one of these Methods, I fear it will be very difficult for us to make a just Disco|very who they are that transgress: For, by what I have seen and heard amongst them, of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">laming and censuring each other for breaking Measures in
<PB N="30" REF="003017_0029_0FEFA01726EA6318">

<P N="3"><PB N="31" REF="003017_0030_0FEFA0115506DBB8">III. THAT they sort the Tobacco, according to its Natures as abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e described, <HI>viz.</HI> Three Sorts Colour and Dry Tobacco; Three Sorts Leaf, and the worst of all.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THAT the Managers report in Writing, the Quantity and Quality of each Ship's Lading.</P>
<P N="5">V. THAT the Merchant, or Importer, be o|bliged to make good to the Proprietors of the To|bacco, the Price settled, and as much more as the Tobacco sells for.</P>
<P N="6">VI. THAT the old Tobacco now on Hand, be viewed, sorted, and valued, by the Managers; and a Report thereof made to the next General Meeting.</P>
<P>HAVING now put down the Scheme; my O|pinion upon the Whole as it stands, is, that it will be impr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ble, and in Part is unnecessary.</P>
<P>FOR the Impracticability, I need only mention, what a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">borious Work it will be, to view, sort, and v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lue, all the <HI>Oroon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ko</HI> Tobacco imported into the Port of <HI>Lond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n.</HI> I cannot think the Managers will undert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke such a Task.</P>
<P>FOR, to come up to the Strictness of this Scheme, they must t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke the Marks and Numbers of every Sortment by it self, with the Price annexed.</P>
<P>ELSE, How sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll we know whether the Possessor of the Tobacco, does not sell under the Prices fixed: or, if for more than the Price fixed, whether the Proprietor has that made Good to him.</P>
<P>TO know that, I can see no other W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, than that the Viewers should take a particular Account of e|very S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtment, and those Accounts be recorded in Books for that Purpose, which will require at least One Clerk to keep those Accounts.</P>
<P>FOR, to comply with this Scheme, the Sellers ought also to gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in particular Accounts of all To|bacco, when sold, that by comparing their Accounts with the Managers Report, we may see if Argee|ments be kept to.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="003017_0031_0FEFA037CF3AD1A8">THIS, if there were no other Objection, I think will be enough to deter the Managers from under|taking such a Task, unless they will be content to neglect their own private Affairs.</P>
<P>But were They to be content, I am afraid the other Merchants will not be willing to Submit all the To|bacco they have, come to the View and Directions of any Number of their own Body, for Reasons that need not be here mentioned.</P>
<P>NOT to say any thing of the Hinderance, such a Method will be to Business, at a Time of brisk Demand, when supposing the Seller may have very good Offers, yet must stand still, until he can get Five of the Managers together, which will be no easy Matter to do; besides the Time that will be lost in Sorting, Viewing and Valuing the Tobacco, and taking the Marks and Numbers; for without taking them, I can|not see how this Scheme can be complied with, to answer the End aimed at.</P>
<P>WERE this Method to be come into, I think it should not be the Manager, nor any of the Mer|chants that should be the Viewers, but Men specially appointed for that Work.</P>
<P>BUT where to find Men in all respects well qualified, I profess I know not. Such Viewers ought to be Men of nice Judgment in Tobacco, to put it into the sundry Sortments, and be able to carry in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ye or Mind the different Qualities, so as to make the like Sortments at one Merchant's House, correspond with those at another Merchant's House; without doing of which, to Exactness, we shall not be upon an Equality, and some will be oppressed, while others get their Hands clear; and the more so, should such Viewers act with Partiality, or be corrupted by pri|vate Interest.</P>
<P>THESE are some of my Reasons against this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king it in the Gross: But some Parts there|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f, I think may and ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t in Practice.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="003017_0032_0FEFA07C5190C7C8">WHAT Part I think needless, is the Bright and Colour'd dry Tobacco, the Value of such Sortments being so various according to the several Degrees of Colour, it will be no easy Matter to ascertain the Price, that depending upon the Fancy of the Buyer; so that instead of Three, there had need be more than Thirteen Sortments made of such Tobacco.</P>
<P>BUT in my Opinion, it is not That Sort of To|bacco that does us the Mischief, because for Colours we have many Buyers, and sundry Markets; so that if one Market will not answer, another may, and if one Buyer will not give a Price, another will; so that in that Case, it is more the Sellers Fault, than the Buyers, that the Price is run down.</P>
<P>IF this be granted, and I think it can hardly be denied, it will be easy to fix from whence the Evil we l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bour under proceeds.</P>
<P>IN my Opinion, it proceeds altogether from the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">afy Sortments, for which in a Manner, we have but one Buyer. I need only appeal to our own dear-bought Experience, for the Truth of this.</P>
<P>WE very well know, the Price of all other sorts of Tobacco has risen and fell, in Proportion to what Price was giv'n for Tobacco by the <HI>French</HI>; that has govern'd the Market, and no doubt will do the like for the Future, or at least as long as those Sortments are in Demand, (almost only) for <HI>France:</HI> 'Tis true, were Leaf in Demand at other Markets, the Case would be altered; but as it is chiefly <HI>France</HI> that consumes that Sort, if the Trade of that Kingdom continues as now it is, in a Company, and that Company con|tinues to employ but one Agent, to buy all the To|bacco they have from <HI>London,</HI> it must be what To|bacco that Agent buys, that will for ever govern the Market, as in Times past it has done, and it is very natural it should be so.</P>

<PB N="36" REF="003017_0035_0FEFA02AA0126F18">
bound in Duty to offer my Thoughts&punc; I wish every Other would as freely declare their Minds.</P>
<P>THE first and most natural Way, and what I chiefly wish may take Effect, or at least may be Es|sayed, is, that the <HI>French</HI> Agent, and we, may come to a fair Treaty. He is so reasonable a Man, that were he made rightly sensible of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd we aim at, I cannot but think, so far from being of|fended, he would think it reasonable every Body con|cerned should live by their Labour, and come into an Agreement with us, that would make both him|self and us easy.</P>
<P>THEREFORE I earnestly wish this Way be tried; and in the most genteel Way we can think of: If that should, as I am hopeful it may, take Effect, all other Methods will be needless to mention.</P>
<P>IF we do come to such a Treaty, I shall men|tion some Things proper to be thought of in such an Agreement, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. THAT the Price to be agreed for, be only for those Three Sorts of Leaf he sends to <HI>France,</HI> which he usually marks ABC; we all know what Sortments they are.</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT the Agreement be for One whole Year, and no more.</P>
<P N="3">III. THAT the Price be either upon all Three Sortments in an Average,</P>
<P N="4">IV. Or Three Prices, according to the Three dif|ferent Qualities.</P>
<P>THE last I think is the most equitable Way, as it gives most Encouragement to the Planters to take Pains in handling their Tob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cco.</P>
<P>BUT in this I own there is a Difficulty&punc; for al|though at the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ale they make three Sorts ABC, and so do in the Samples, when they look upon them at our Houses:</P>
<P>YET before bought&punc; what we call A, they call B, and so B a C; and by that Means, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Buying,
<PB N="37" REF="003017_0036_0FEFA03A05AD3388">
make very few A's, though at Weighing off, I know they are not so nice.</P>
<P>TO prevent all Disputes about the different Qua|lities, I think we had better, to the <HI>French,</HI> make but Two Sortments of Leaf: For such as they call A's, will bear no Proportion to B and C, hardly Five such Hogsheads coming in an Hundred.</P>
<P>SO that were we to make Three Sortments, ABC, in equal Quantity, and let the middle Price be the Avarage Price <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or the Whole, I doubt that would be very difficult, if not impossible; the Seller and Buyer will so differ about the Quality.</P>
<P>TO preve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t such Disputes, I can think of no bet|ter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, than to put the Tobacco into Three Sort|ments, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>THE very best superfine Leaf, which will be but a few, into the first A&punc; all the other Leaf to be very good, but inferiour to the A's, to be the Second Sortment, (or rather the First Sortment to the <HI>French</HI>) called B.</P>
<P>THE Third, (or as I would have it,) the Se|cond Sort, to be called C, and to consist of good Tobacco, proper for the <HI>French</HI> Use.</P>
<P>I would have a greater Disproportion made in the Price, between A and B, than between B and C; which two last Sortments, may be made pretty near in Number and Quantity to one another; always allowing the Advantage to the Buyer.</P>
<P>WHATEVER Agreement shall be made with the <HI>French,</HI> I propose may be only for B and C, and then whether the Price be made upon both Sorts together, or each separate, will break no Squares.</P>
<P>AS for Instance, Should the B's be put at Three Pence Farthing, and the C's at Two Pence Three Farthings&punc; the Average Price will be Three Pence; which I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s as low as the Planters can live by&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="003017_0037_0FEFA079C21B7D60">IF those be the Prices fixed for the B's and C's&punc; I think the A's should not be under Four Pence at least.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to this Division&punc; if the B's and C's should be unequ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l; by putting some of the A's to them&punc; may make them equal.</P>
<P>BUT I should like better to have each Sortment sold by it self, 'twould be a great Encouragement to the Planters; then such as took Pains with their Tobacco, would reap the Benefit thereof: Whereas now they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omplain we make hardly any Difference between Good and Bad.</P>
<P>THUS much I thought proper to hint, in case we should come to an Agreement with the <HI>French</HI> Agent.</P>
<P>BUT if he will not come t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an Undert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king with us, I think we are bound by Duty, and Interest, to think of other Methods&punc;</P>
<P>NO doubt, Methods may be found out&punc; for we know the <HI>French</HI> want and must have our Tobacco, as much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we want their Money.</P>
<P>THEREFORE the only Dispute will be, which of us will have most Patience. I m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke no doubt the <HI>French</HI> will endeavour to tire us out.

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> IF after Tryal, we find the <HI>French</HI> Agent, will not come into reasonable Measures with us, but that we must be Obliged to stand it out with him, I think we ought in Justice to our selves, to acquaint the Merchants of the Out-Ports, with what we have been doing, and what we aim to do f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r the Good of the Trade. I make no doubt they will gladly come into the like Measures with us. In short I think it will be our Interest to settle a Correspondency with the Out-Ports, as hinted in my Representation given into this Meeting the 13<HI>th</HI> of <HI>March</HI> last.</P>

<P>THEREFORE, if your People have any Regard to their own Welfare, now is the Time for 'em to help themselves, we have done much more than ever I expected would have been done by us of our selves, without their Help. Indeed I thought the good Work now begun, must of necessity have commenced on your side; but as Things are, we have much shortned your Work; nevertheless a good deal remains for you to do; what that is, I need not mention to thee, I know thou hast it much at Heart. I need only wish the People may be so wise, to come into what thou intendest to propose; they never had such an Op|portunity, and I am afraid never will again, if now neglected; the best Time to strike, is when the Iron is hot; we are now stirring, and in a Ferment, if we be suffer'd to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, I much fear shall never be sured up to such a Temper again, at least not in Haste.

<P>THIS is plain, and needs no further Comment than to acquaint the Reader, that the Assistance here hinted at, is no more than some such Letter from all Parts of the Country, as is already sign'd by great Numbers, and sent from some Places. His last Letter of the 15th of <HI>May,</HI> which cover'd his Ob|jections to Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de</HI>'s Proposals before recited, has what follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<PB N="49" REF="003017_0048_0FEFA0333A42C3B0">
That Gentleman will prevail upon some of us to break the Agreement: My self was tempted that Way Yesterday; and Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts given, That if I would give Way, I should find my Account in it.

I make no Doubt the <HI>French</HI> will refrain Buying as long as they can; but very long they cannot: I wish our People may but have Patience until they are forced to Buy; in that Case we shall gain the Victory: That I should not despair of, were we all Unanimous; but That I doubt: And the more, for that I perceive a great Alteration in some, for wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of thy Presence: That Restraint seems now to be taken off.</P>
<P>THOU'LT see by the inclos'd Objections to <HI>Samuel Hyde</HI>'s Proposals, that I have express'd my self with all the Earnestness I well can; I can but do my Part; I wish every Body were of the same Mind; but we are too many to do Good: Were we fewer, would be much easier to agree.</P></Q>

Tobacco, since what came to them was chiefly their own; which is so good a Reason, that I think there is no Room to doubt their Sincerity. So that I conclude, they have already in all the Out Ports of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> form'd themselves into Societies, un|der some such Regulations as the Merchants in <HI>Lon|don</HI> have done, and consequently that That Difficulty is removed.</P>
<P>I have now plainly and sincerely published what is come to my Knowledge of this Affair, without any Remarks of my own; which I could not have for|bore, were I not sensible that these Things alone, would make this Piece longer than I could wish it: But, as the Sense in all the foregoing Recitals, is clearly express'd, there is the less Necessity to re|peat, or put it in other Words. Yet, I hope, the <HI>Rea|der</HI> will excuse me, if I do Justice to those Gentlemen that have distinguished themselves by their assiduous Endeavours for our Interest; who those are, I hope will evidently appear by the foregoing Narration: And I can further testify, That Mr. <HI>Falconar,</HI> parti|cularly, has taken true Pains to promote what he conceived would be for our Advantage:&mdash; And Mr. <HI>Hyde</HI>'s Scheme, for the same End, manifestly evinces his Earnestness to help forward so good a Work, and I hope all the other Gentlemen mean the same Thing, tho' they had not made it so much their Business; I can only say that they appeared to do so whilst I was with them.</P>
<P>I should here conclude; but I believe it will be ob|serv'd how solicit us Mr. <HI>Falconar</HI> is, that the Peo|ple of this Country may have some Regard to what I shall Propose to them, which he apprehends would be much to their Advantage; so that I conclude, some Proposal fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m me will be expected: To com|ply therefore in some Manner with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xpectation, I shall only say, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irst Thing I had to Pro|pose&punc; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d indeed the only Thing that can be done

by the Country, without the Assistance of the Le|gislature,) was no more than Writing some su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Letter to the Merchants from all Parts of the Country as is already so Universally approv'd, and sign'd in all Places, where it has yet been offer'd: What ap|pears to me to be further necessary, and may be worthy of our Legislature's Consideration, is chiefly contain'd in Mr. <HI>Falconar</HI>'s Letters before recited, in Relation to the fixing a certain Time for the Ship|ping off our Tobacco: The many Advantages and Conveniences that would attend such a Thing, are there so amply explain'd, that I need not add any Thing further to enforce them. And as lessening the Quantity, and mending the Quality of our Tobacco, is what every Body is already satisfy'd would be for the Universal Good&punc; and as I have formerly, and several other Gentlemen since, proposed such Me|thods as appear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to us most Necessary, and Equita|table for attaining that End, I Question not there|fore, but our Legislature, will take the Whole under their Consideration, and do therein what is best for the Country. But as the Evil we labour under, proceeds very much from the Discord a|mongst the Merchants, to whom we Consign our To|bacco, which they themselves allow, I would there|fore particularly recommend it to the Consideration of our Legislature, Whether some effectual Means may not be found to oblige 'em to a strict and steady Union. What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to me to be necessary for that Purpose is, to restrain every Master of Ship, from taking any Tobacco on Board, under severe Penal|ties, until he produces an authentick Certificate, that his Owner has bound himself in a Bond, under what Penalty the Legislature shall think convenient, to Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> for Instance, or some other principal M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Community, to abide by, and conform himself to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> shall be agreed on, by such a Majority <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Number, as they have

already agreed, shall determine all Debates amongst them: And that their Masters be likewise impowered and so secured by his Principal, That each and every one of them may also enter into Bonds to the Coun|try here, That his Owner shall punctually and faithfully comply with his Bond, for that Purpose pass'd in <HI>London,</HI> before he be permitted to take To|bacco on Board. If it be objected to this, That it will be a Hardship on the <HI>London</HI> Merchants to be so restrain'd, whilst the Out Ports have their Liberty: I answer, That the Out Ports must also be under the same Restraint; that is, That they, and their Ma|sters, be likewise bound in the same Manner, to abide by such Agreements as they have or will come into, in their respective Ports. For, as I inform'd the <HI>Read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r,</HI> It's not to be questioned, but that they have form'd themselves into Societies by this Time, as well as the <HI>London</HI> Merchants; if not, some such Method as this, will oblige them so to do. After all, by this Method, we do not lay them, or the <HI>London</HI> Merchants, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er any Restraint: We only use Means to oblige them punctually to comply with what they have, or shall restrain them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es to: So that it can be no Hardship upon any of them to be bound to abide by the Determination of Two Thirds of their own Number, who will not surely lay them|selves, and the other Gentlemen of the Trade, under such Diffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulties as cannot be complied with; or if by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xperience they find, that what they had agreed upon in any of their Meetings, was like to be I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">con|venient to the Trade in general, there is no doubt but that at the next Meeting&punc; they would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it. So that upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, I hope it will not appear unreasonable to oblige them to stand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to what they themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ree to&punc; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> more.

conform themselves to it. I wish any Thing of this Kind, may be found, upon due Consideration, to be practicable: If so, I am possitive it would effectually convince them, that we are in Earnest, and oblige them to keep their Agreements; which would alone (as some of those Gentlemen are of Opinion) be at least Forty Thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> in this Pro|vince's Way: It is certainly worth trying, to save so much Money to the Country.</P>
<P>I now conclude, with assuring my Country-Men, That if further Particulars relating to this Affair come to me, which I think may be useful, I shall in the same Manner communicate them to the Pub|lick; and shall only add, That if in any Thing I have been able to do herein, either in <HI>London</HI> or here, I have rendered any Service to my Country, I shall think my Time well employ'd; if not, I shall still enjoy that Peace of Mind, which always attends an honest Man, who is conscious of having used his utmost Endeavours in so l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">udable a Cause as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Good of his Country; which was the sincere In|tention of,</P>
