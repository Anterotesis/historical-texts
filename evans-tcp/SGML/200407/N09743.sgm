<L>Now thro' the veil of ancient days review</L>
<L>The period fam'd when first Columbus touch'd</L>
<L>The shore so long unknown, thro' various toils,</L>
<L>Famine and death, the hero made his way,</L>

<L>Fam'd Amazonia's stream with dead! Or why,</L>
<L>Once more revive the story old in fame,</L>
<L>Of Atabilipa by thirst of gold</L>
<L>Depriv'd of life: which not Peru's rich ore,</L>
<L>Nor Mexico's vast mines cou'd then redeem.</L>

<L>High in renown th' intreprid hero stands,</L>
<L>From Europes shores advent'ring first to try</L>
<L>New seas, new oceans, unexplor'd by man.</L>
<L>Fam'd Cabot too may claim our noblest song,</L>
<L>Who from th' Atlantic surge descry'd these shores,</L>
<L>As on he coasted from the Mexic bay</L>
<L>To Acady and piny Labradore.</L>
<L>Nor less than him the muse would celebrate</L>
<L>Bold Hudson stemming to the pole, thro' seas</L>
<L>Vex'd with continual storms, thro' the cold straits,</L>
<L>Where Europe and America oppose</L>
<L>Their shores contiguous, and the northern sea</L>
<L>Confin'd, indignant, swells and roars between.</L>
<L>With these be number'd in the list of fame</L>
<L>Illustrious Raleigh, hapless in his fate:</L>
<L>Forgive me Raleigh, if an infant muse</L>
<L>Borrows thy name to grace her humble strain;</L>
<L>By many nobler are thy virtues sung;</L>
<L>Envy no more shall throw them in the shade;</L>
<L>They pour new lustre on Britannia's isle.</L>
<L>Thou too, advent'rous on th' Atlantic main,</L>
<L>Burst thro' its storms and fair Virginia hail'd.</L>
<L>The simple natives saw thy canvas flow,</L>
<L>And gaz'd aloof upon the shady shore:</L>
<L>For in her woods America contain'd,</L>
<L>From times remote, a savage race of men.</L>
<L>How shall we know their origin, how tell,</L>
<L>From whence or where the Indian tribes arose?</L>

<L>And long has this defy'd the sages skill</L>
<L>T' investigate: Tradition seems to hide</L>
<L>The mighty secret from each mortal eye,</L>
<L>How first these various nations South and North</L>
<L>Possest these shores, or from what countries came.</L>
<L>Whether they sprang from some premoeval head</L>
<L>In their own lands, like Adam in the East;</L>
<L>Yet this the sacred oracles deny,</L>
<L>And reason too reclaims against the thought.</L>
<L>For when the gen'ral deluge drown'd the world,</L>
<L>Where could their tribes have found security?</L>
<L>Where find their fate but in the ghastly deep?</L>
<L>Unless, as others dream, some chosen few</L>
<L>High on the Andes 'scap'd the gen'ral death,</L>
<L>High on the Andes wrapt in endless snow,</L>
<L>Where winter in his wildest fury reigns.</L>
<L>But here Philosophers oppose the scheme,</L>
<L>The earth, say they, nor hills nor mountains knew</L>
<L>E'er yet the universal flood prevail'd:</L>
<L>But when the mighty waters rose aloft</L>
<L>Rous'd by the winds, they shook their solid case</L>
<L>And in convulsions tore the drowned world!</L>
<L>'Till by the winds assuag'd they quickly fell</L>
<L>And all their ragged bed exposed to view.</L>
<L>Perhaps far wand'ring towards the northren pole,</L>
<L>The straits of Zembla and the Frozen Zone,</L>
<L>And where the eastern Greenland almost joins</L>
<L>America's north point, the hardy tribes</L>
<L>Of banish'd Jews, Siberians, Tartars wild</L>
<L>Came over icy mountains, or on floats</L>
<L>First reach'd these coasts hid from the world beside.</L>
<L>And yet another argument more strange</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="012398_0007_0F8972ED72CD3BD8">Reserv'd for men of deeper thought and late</L>

<L>Your sophistry Acasto makes me smile;</L>
<L>The roving mind of man delights to dwell</L>
<L>On hidden things, merely because they're hid;</L>
<L>He thinks his knowledge ne'er can reach too high</L>
<L>And boldly pierces nature's inmost haunts</L>
<L>But for uncertainties; your broken isles,</L>
<L>You northern Tartars, and your wand'ring Jews.</L>
<L>Hear what the voice of history proclaims.</L>
<L>The Carthaginians, e'er the Roman yoke</L>
<L>Broke their proud spirits and enslav'd them too,</L>
<L>For navigation were renown'd as much</L>
<L>As haughty Tyre with all her hundred fleets;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="012398_0008_0F8972EE356ECD70">Full many a league their vent'rous seamen sail'd</L>

<L>Of Africa, and to Canary isles</L>
<L>By them call'd fortunate, so Flaceus sings,</L>
<L>Because eternal spring there crowns the fields,</L>
<L>And fruits delicious bloom throughout the year.</L>
<L>From voyaging here this inference I draw,</L>
<L>Perhaps some barque with all her num'rous crew</L>
<L>Caught by the eastern trade wind hurry'd on</L>
<L>Before th' steady blast to Brazil's shore,</L>
<L>New Amazonia and the coasts more south.</L>
<L>Here standing and unable to return,</L>
<L>For ever from their native skies estrang'd,</L>
<L>Doubtless they made the unknown land their own,</L>
<L>And in the course of many rolling years</L>
<L>A num'rous progeny from these arose,</L>
<L>And spread throughout the coasts; those whom we call</L>
<L>Brazilians, Mexicans, Peruvians rich,</L>
<L>Th' tribes of Chili, Patagon and those</L>
<L>Who till the shores of Amazon's long stream.</L>
<L>When first the pow'rs of Europe here attain'd</L>
<L>Vast empires, kingdoms, cities, palaces</L>

<L>Such disquisition leads the puzzled mind</L>

<P><Q>The author of this excellent work was educated in the uni|versity of Edinburgh. The observations delivered in it are the result of extensive and successful practice. His remarks upon the diseases of children are rendered particularly valuable, from his having had the care of a Foundling hospital, for many years in England, where he had frequent opportunites of seeing the bene|ficial effects of those rules he lays down, for the management of children both in sickness and health. Upon the whole, we cannot help adding, that while the author has treated of all his subjects in so familiar a style, that he is intelligible to persons unacquainted with the most common terms in medicine; yet he has in all parts of his work, adhered so closely to the present approved system of physic, that the ablest physicians may read him with advantage.</Q></P>
