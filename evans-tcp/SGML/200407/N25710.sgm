<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by <HI>T.W. Fitzgerald, Esq.</HI>&mdash;Spoken by Mr. <HI>Macready.</HI></BYLINE>
<L>WHEN invalids possess both faith and wealth,</L>
<L>They'll find a nostrum to restore their health;</L>
<L>A <HI>panacea</HI> advertis'd to cure</L>
<L>Each ill the human body can endure.</L>
<L>But our bold Author claims a nobler art,</L>
<L>And advertises to relieve&mdash;the heart</L>
<L>So many patients he expects to see,</L>
<L>That I'm appointed as his deputy.</L>
<L>Now, then, your mental maladies explain,</L>
<L>And I'll remove or mitigate the pain.</L>
<L>Does love or jealousy your peace molest,</L>
<L>Revenge inflame, ambition gnaw your breast?</L>
<L>For jealousy, a sovereign balm behold,&mdash;</L>
<L>The husband's certain cure, a pill of gold;</L>
<L>This dose, administer'd with prudent care,</L>
<L>Dispels at once the frailties of the fair;</L>
<L>Deprives the proctor of his <HI>crim.-con.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee,</L>
<L>And tunes the chord that jar'd to harmony.</L>
<L>Sould love torment some Romeo's heated brain,</L>
<L>Or agonize a Iuliet's breast with pain,</L>
<L>Let them my po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent remedy apply,&mdash;</L>
<L>The maid shall cease to pine, the youth to sigh:</L>
<L>Gold shall restore each drooping lover's health,</L>
<L>And passion find a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">stitute in wealth.</L>
<L>But let not ill-tim'd ridicule degrade</L>
<L>What Heav'n, when well applied, a blessing made,</L>
<L>To foster merit, wheresoever found,</L>
<L>And with improvement cheer a country round;</L>
<L>To feed the hungry, and to clothe the poor,</L>
<L>And send the beggar happy from the door;</L>
<L>To mitigate the horrors of despair,</L>
<L>And make the family of want our care;</L>
<L>To succour genius, drooping in distress,</L>
<L>Making the business of our lives to bless.</L>
<L>When the rich man can such employment find,</L>
<L>We wish his purse as ample as his mind.</L>
<L>For one poor patient I've an anxious fear;</L>
<L>And you must be his kind physicians here.</L>
<L>Our Author has to-night so much at stake,</L>
<L>He finds his throbbing heart inclin'd to ache!</L>
<L>But should his Play a lib'ral audience please,</L>
<L>Your warm applause will set his heart at ease.</L>
