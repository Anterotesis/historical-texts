<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and Fellow-Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the present alarming situation of America in general, and the town of Boston in particular; as well as the utter abhorrence which you lately expressed at the conduct of Messrs. USTICKS, for supplying the army under General GAGE, who is now carrying on the siege of Boston, with implements of war, &amp;c. and, notwithstanding that this matter had been previously and earnestly recommended to your most serious attention by the General Committee; yet, are there men to be found, who are base enough, for lucrative considerations, to continue supplying the troops with necessaries, for effecting the immediate destruction of our brethren and fellow-subjects in Boston, who are now suffering the most unjust and cruel hardships in the common cause of America, which, if accomplished, will finally overtake the inhabitants of all the colonies. The consideration of which, induced a number of the Freemen, Freeholders, Merchants, and others, to meet at the house of the Widow VAN DE WATER, in order to devise the most prudent and efficacious means for averting the impending ruin, that such a conduct must inevitably involve us in, and that to the eternal reproach of the community.</P>
<P>Accordingly a Committee was appointed to wait on those persons, to dissuade them from acting so base and unnatural a part; but, to our inexpressible grief, they were found to be so infatuated with the hopes of gain, that no impression could be made on their minds, of the cruelty, or injustice of their conduct. It was therefore thought by the Meeting, absolutely necessary, once more, in the present posture of affairs, to collect the sense of the city and county, on the propriety of furnishing the troops with hay, straw, &amp;c. as well as boards and plank; the former of which will enable the General (as indeed without it, he cannot) more effectually to take the field, and the latter to make platforms for the artillery, &amp;c. And, as there are now two transports sent here for those articles, as well as others, no doubt.&mdash;And as <HI>Ralph Thurman</HI> and <HI>Robert Harding</HI> have been employed to furnish the aforesaid articles, it is earnestly requested that the Freemen, Freeholders, and other inhabitants of the city and county will meet at VI o'clock on next Saturday evening, at the LIBERTY-POLE, in order to signify their sense on the present occasion; as those persons both persist in supplying the army with every necessary, in their way.</P>
