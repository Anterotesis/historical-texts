Estate they were Glorious Creatures <HI>Sons of God, and Morning Stars.</HI> How great must that Evil be, which can turn an Angel into a Devil? Sin has done this, and that as to millions of them. There are more Devils then there are men in in the World; since there is no man, but there are Devils to Tempt him unto sin; and we read in the Gospel of thousands of Devils possessing one miserable man. It is Sin that has made so many Devils. Man was a glorious Creature before he was a Sinner. The most glorious Crea|ture that ever was made, next to the An|gels. Psal. 8.5. <HI>thou hast made him a little lower than the Angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour</HI>; but Sin has made him the worst Creature on the Earth. It has made him to be worse, nay, to be more irrational than the beasts that perish. How often are Sinners charged with act|ing more unreasonably than the beasts do. Isa. 1.3. <HI>The Ox knows his Owner, and the Ass his Masters Crib, but Israel doth not know, my people doth not understand.</HI> Alas! they were worse then bruits, who will pay some acknowledgment to their Fee|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er.

is poysonful and hurtful to him; yet thus irrational are men. Altho' they are told, and cannot but know that Sin is deadly poyson, and that if they commit such Sins, their Souls must dy for it; for all that they will venture. Sin has made men to be thus unreasonable. Nor is there a|ny Creature on earth an enemy to God, but only man, and Sin has made him so. It is Sin that has made this World to be an <HI>Evil</HI> World. Gal. 1.4. <HI>This present evil world.</HI> Had it not been for Sin, this World had never been an Evil One. It has brought a Curse and Misery on the <HI>Creation,</HI> so that the whole Creation sighs under it, and groans to be delivered from that corruption, bondage, vanity and mi|sery which the sin of men has caused it to become subject unto. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.22. There had never been any other Evil, if it had not been for Sin. No man would ever have known by an experience of it, what Evil meant. Hence the forbidden Tree was called <HI>the Tree of knowledge of good and evil.</HI> Gen. 2.17.

mixture of good in them, but Sin hath not so; Nor is it possible ever to make it good; Nor has it in its own nature a|ny tendency unto good. It is not the cause of any good. It is true, that Sin may through the wisdom power and goodness of God, ordering and over-ru|ling all things, be an occasion of good. This we see in <HI>Onesimus,</HI> who was gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of theft, and ran away from his Master, and was Committed to Prison, where the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> became the Instrument of his Conversion. <HI>Philem.</HI> 10. A great sin may be an occasion of the Conversion, and so of the Salvation of a Sinner, but not the cause of it. A corrupt Tree can not bring forth good fruit.

Nor does any thing but what is bitter, come out of this Fount<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n. If we compare Sin with other Evils, we shall see that it is worse than any of them all. It is a grea|ter evil than any Affliction. A man had beetter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> many Afflictions than one sin. Affliction tho' evil has some good in it, but so has not Sin. <HI>David</HI> said, <HI>it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

He does <HI>chasten them for their pro|fit</HI> Heb. 12 10. Therefore they may bless God for sending Afflictions on them. It is reported concerning that Holy man, Mr. <HI>Dod,</HI> that when a very bitter Afflicti|on befel him, <HI>Well</HI> (said he) <HI>I will go into my Study and bless God for this Afflicti|on, for I am perswaded that He intends to do me good by it.</HI> But a man may not say, I thank God I was left, to commit such a sin. The Lord has promised that He will in faithfulness afflict his Children; He will hedge up their way with Thorns, to prevent them from sinning. In the Covenant of Grace there is a promise of Physick as well as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Food: Afflictions are Physick for the Soul; but the Lord has not promised that He will leave his Ser|vants to fall into great sins, although He has promised that if they do so, He will recover them out of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

them, then when under sore Afflictions and Temptations. When they walk through the midst of the Valley of the shadow of death He is with them. <HI>Psal.</HI> 23.4. But Sin will cause God to depart. A Prophet said, <HI>The Lord is wtth you, whilst you are with him,</HI> but <HI>if you forsake Him, He will forsake you.</HI> 2 Chron. 15.2. When <HI>Israel</HI> Sinned, the Lord withdrew from them, and told them that if they did not put away the accursed thing, He would be with them no more. <HI>Iosh.</HI> 7.12. <HI>Sampson</HI> found this to be true by woful experience, although He was not at first sensible of it. Judg. 16.20. <HI>He wist not that the Lord was departed from him.</HI> It was because he had Sinned, that the Lord departed from him. When the case is so with a man, that he must either suffer or sin, if he is wise, he will chuse to suffer any thing rather then sin. <HI>Moses</HI> did like a Wise man, when he <HI>chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of Sin.</HI> Heb. 11.25. For the greatest Affliction has not so much evil in it as the least Sin. Death is a more formidable evil than Affliction: But Sin is far more evil then Death it self. <HI>Solo|mon</HI> found it to be <HI>more bitter than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI>

Eccles. 7.26. And so shall every Sinner find it to be, either by bitter Repentance for it, or else by being punished for it, when Repentance will be too late. <HI>Men ought to resist unto blood striving against sin.</HI> Heb. 12.4. They ought rather to loose their blood, to part with their lives, then to Sin against God, Thousands of Saints have chosen Death rather than Sin. It is said of the Primitive Martyrs, <HI>they Loved not their lives unto death.</HI> Rev. 12.11. They might have lived much longer if they would have Sinned to save their Lives; but they chose rather to dy than to sin: Some of the Blessed Martyrs chose to be tortured to death, rather than to commit a seemingly little sin. Ecclesiastical Sto|ry informs of one that had his life offered to him on condition that he would con|tribute but so much as one half penny to encourage the Building of an Idolatrous Temple; but he chose rather to dy by most Exquisite Torments. And the Scrip|ture speaks of them who were <HI>tortured not accepting deliverance.</HI> Heb. 11.35. When that bloody Tyrant <HI>Antiochus</HI> told those Martyrs he would spare their lives if they would but eat one mouthful of Swines <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they chose rather to be tortured to

death, than to transgress the Law of God, although it were but in a Ceremony. Sin is a greater evil than Hell it self. Yea, there is more evil in one sin, then in all the Everlasting Burnings of the bottomless pit. The Holy God has made Hell to punish Sinners. <HI>He has ordained Tophet of old, He has made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and much wood, the breath of the Lord like a stream of brimstone does kin|dle it.</HI> Isa. 30.33. But God is not the Au|thor of Sin. He is the punisher of it, has made a strict Law against it; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> never was or can be the Author of it.

Will. Every Sin is a violation of that Law which is expressive of the Holy Will of God. It is indeed a despising of the Law. Lev. 26.15. <HI>If ye shall despise my Statutes.</HI> Sinners cast away the Law of the Lord of Hosts, and despise the Word of the Holy One of <HI>Israel.</HI> Isa. 5.24. A Sinner is a practical Blasphemer; he saith of the Law of God, that it is no good Law; that it is a Law not worth the re|garding. Neh. 9.26. <HI>They cast the Law be|hind their backs,</HI> as a man casts a thing that he despiseth, behind his back. A Sinner <HI>Iudgeth the Law.</HI> Jam. 4.11. by trans|gressing it, he judgeth it to be a bad Law. Is such blasphemy a light matter, or to be mocked at? Sin is Rebellion against the Lord. Hos. 13.16 <HI>Samaria has rebelled a|gainst her God.</HI> Sinners make an Insurre|ction against Heaven. Mic. 2 8. <HI>They are risen up against me as an Enemy.</HI> They take up Arms against the Infinite and E|ternal Majesty. Act 5 39 They are found <HI>even to fight against God.</HI> Sin grieveth the Heart of God. When the Old World became exceeding sinful, it repented the Lord that he made man on the Earth, and <HI>it grieved him at the heart.</HI> Gen. 6.6. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were in the

The Lord speaks of the sins of men as if his heart were broken by them. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 6.9. <HI>I am broken with their whorish heart, which has departed from me.</HI> And shall men make light of that which is so grievous to God! Sin is a dishonour to his Name. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.23. <HI>By breaking the Law thou dishonourest God.</HI> Some sins especially cast horrible contempt on the Glorious Name of God. Sins against knowledge (which the Scrip|ture calls <HI>presumptuous Sins</HI> do so. Numb. 15.30. <HI>The Soul that does ought presumptu|ously reproacheth the Lord,</HI> as if he were ei|ther an Ignorant or an Impotent God: As if he either did not know that such an affront was offered to his Name, or had not power to revenge it. Sin is a practi|cal disowning and denying the glorious Attributes of the Ever Blessed God. When men sin, they do not really believe the Omnipresence of God. Ezek. 8.12. <HI>They say the Lord sees us not, the Lord has forsaken the earth.</HI> There are Sinners, that if they thought a man, nay, a child of seven years old, that could tell of it, saw them, they would not commit that sin.

That He by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they must be Judged another day, looks on them all that while! By sin men defy his Power: Sinners give the Almighty the challenge. Isa. 5.19. They said, <HI>Let him make speed and hasten his work, that we may see it, and let the Counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it. q. d.</HI> He has threatned us a long time, but why does not he do what he threatens? Let him come and do his worst, the sooner the better, we fear him not. We must not suppose that they did in words thus ex|press themselves, but this was the language of their sinful practices. They lived as if they had been really of that opinion, as if they thought they could be too hard for the Almighty. Sin calls the Truth of God into Question God says, If thou dost transgress my Law, <HI>ye shall surely dy for it</HI>: But Sin and the Devil says, it may be not for all that. <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.8. Therefore it must needs provoke him. How are men provoked if their fellow creatures give them the Ly? And will not the most High God be offended, when wretched men shall make him a Liar? Sin strikes at the very Life and Being of God: It says, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> there is no God in Heaven. It is an

Iniquity to be punished by the Judge, for it <HI>denies the God that is above.</HI> Job 31.28. So far as a man is a <HI>Sinner,</HI> he is an <HI>A|theist.</HI> Psal. 14 1. <HI>The fool has said in his heart that there is no God.</HI> It is hardly pos|sible for a man with a rational soul really to believe that there is no God; but the fool wisheth there were none. And he does not believe that there is such a God as indeed there is. He is ready to think that God is altogether such another as himself, which is to Ungod him. He says in his heart, that God is not so Holy a God as his Ministers and as his Word declareth him to be, which is in effect to say, that He is no God: For if He should be less holy then He is, He should cease to be God. Holiness is called the Life of God. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.18. Wherefore Sin which strikes at the Life of God, is the highest Treason. And is it then to be made light of? By what has been said, it is manifest, that Sin is highly displeasing to the Lord; and the Lord himself has in more ways then one made it known, that Sin does provoke the Eyes of his Glory. He has made men and Angels to see that he can not endure it, by his punishing of it. Sometimes the Holy God has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

So <HI>Adam</HI> and all his Posterity, of which there are thou|sands of millions, are made miserable for one sin. They are all condemned to dy for that one sin. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12. <HI>By one man Sin entred into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men.</HI> And in verse 14. It is said, <HI>that Death reigned from A|dam to Moses, even over them that had not Sinned after the similitude of Adams Trans|gression.</HI> There were about two thousand and five hundred years from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Moses.</HI> All that lived in that Time, even Infants, and all who never sinned after the similitude of <HI>Adams</HI> Transgression, yet are dead, because of that sin of his. So all that have lived and died in succee|ding Ages. In ver. 18. the Apostle says, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by <HI>the offence of one,</HI> (or as the words
<PB N="18" REF="000879_0019_0FAC94F3A4056B98">
<HI>di henos paraptomatos</HI> may be read) by <HI>one offence</HI> Judgment came <HI>upon all men to Condemnation.</HI> No Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> excepting one, was imputed to his Poste|rity, <HI>viz.</HI> his first sin in eating the forbid|den fruit; for after that he ceased to be a publick person representing all mankind; so then, for that <HI>one sin,</HI> he and all his Po|sterity were condemned to Death. Be|hold yet further the severity of God. He has sometimes punished seemingly little sins after a dreadful manner, that men might see how their sins displease him, and that they might tremble to sin against him. When <HI>Nabad and Abihu</HI> instead of taking fire from the Altar according to Divine Institution, would follow their own in|vention, and make use of another fire, without any warning given to them to repent of their sin, God killed them in a moment; there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them, and they dyed. When in the Wilderness a man did but gather a few sticks on the Sabbath day, God from Heaven commanded that that man should be stoned to death. When <HI>Uzzah</HI> in|considerately took hold on the Ark, intend|ing no harm, only to keep it from falling God smote him for his error; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="19" REF="000879_0020_0FAC94F464EF1BD0">
dyed by the Ark of God. When the men of <HI>Bethshemesh</HI> looked into the Ark, probably with no ill design, only to see whether the <HI>Philistans</HI> had not taken some|thing out of it, <HI>the Lord smote of the people, fifty thousand and threescore and ten men.</HI> I Sam. 6.19. some have wondred how that could be, because <HI>Bethshemesh</HI> was a small Town, not containing fifty thousand, nor so many as five thousand; but as 'tis pro|bable the people round about the Country hearing that the Ark was come to <HI>Bethshe|mesh,</HI> came flocking thither, and did ir|reverently look upon it, (which they might not do) and some would be look-into it; and for this error, above fifty thousand, not of the men of <HI>Bethshemesh</HI> only, but <HI>of the people,</HI> lost their lives. So highly is God offended at sin. But his Holy Displeasure at sin appears in nothing so much, as in the dreadful suf|ferings of the Lord Jesus Christ, when he stood in the room of Sinners, sustai|ning their person before God his Fa|ther. Rom. 8.32. <HI>He spared not his own Son.</HI> Christ is Gods own Son, and a Son that never offended him in any thing. Christ is dearer to God than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Angels in heaven, or men on

earth. Neverthess, when He became a Surety for Sinners, God would not spare him, nor abate him any thing of the punishment due for sin. The truth is, God never pardoned any sin without satisfaction made for the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ury done to his Name thereby. No sin but God either has punished it in the Surety and Saviour of Sinners, or he will punish it in the Sinner himself to all Eternity.

Christ the Son of God became Sub+ject to it, because of our Sins, that he might deliver us from the Curse. What terri|ble things did Christ suffer for our sakes?

The consideration of what Christ suffered for our Sins, should make us afraid of the least Sin, and not to make a light matter of any Sin: No not of idle words. No man ever spoke an idle word in his life, but either Christ dyed to obtain the pardon of it; or, he that has been guilty of it, must dy for ever for it.

far more dreadful than any Temporal Ones. As the Soul is far more worth than the Body, so Spiritual Judgments which lite on the Souls of men, are more to be trembled at, than those which con|cern the outward man only.

That Soul which is more worth than a world, sin hurts it. Heb. 2.10. <HI>thou hast sinned a|gainst thy Soul.</HI> Sin wrongs the Soul.

Prov. 6.32. <HI>He that committeth adultery with a woman, destroys his own soul.</HI> Now what an Evil is Sin which has destroyed millions of Immortal Souls, which nothing else could hurt if it were not for sin?

yet they are to renew their Re|pentance.

Nevertheless, a few things let me now speak to you in the Name of the Lord.</P>
<P>Consider. 1. <HI>You have been a great Sin|ner:</HI> And in very Truth a great Fool. Although you are little &amp; young in years, you are great in Wickedness. It is seldom seen that one so young as you are, ha's been guilty of such Prodigious wickedness. You are (as I understand) hardly Nineteen years old, and yet ripe for a Lamentable Destruction as to your Body, if not as to your Soul. You are known to be guilty of Fornication and that more than once, and with more persons than one, as young as you are: Oh horrid Shame! But be|sides that, you have been guilty of Mur|der: Yea, and of unnatural Murder too. <HI>Can a woman forget her Sucking Child that she should not have Compassion on the Son of her Womb?</HI> She may, but then she must be unnatural. And so monstrously unna|tural have you been, as not to have Com|passion on the Son of your Womb: but to be guilty of Murdering it, whose blood Cryes for Vengeance against you, from the ground where you exposed it to death. You have defiled the Land wherein you live. It should be an humbling Consid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ration to you, that all this Provinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

<HI>New-England</HI> must fare the worse, and be exposed to the wrath of Heaven if you should be suffered to live any longer in it: for so does the Scripture speak. Numb. 35.31, 33. <HI>You shall take no satisfaction for the Life of a Murderer which is guilty of blood. You shall not pollute the Land wherein you are, for blood it defileth the Land, and the Land can not be cleansed of the blood which is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.</HI> Methinks you should sometimes hear the blood of your woful Infant, Crying, <HI>Ven|geance! Vengeance! Lord,</HI> upon my unna|tural Mother, who murdered me as soon as I came into the World. And what if you murdered its Soul as well as Body? What then do you think will come on you? Nevertheless as vile a Sinner as you have been.</P>
<P>Consider 2. <HI>If you go to the Lord with a truly penitent heart, God will for Christ sake forgive your sin.</HI> This will God do, not for the sake of your penitence, (be asha|med and confounded thou sinful Crea|ture) but for the sake of the merit of the Death of his own Son, who shed his Blood, that so the bloodiest Sinners who penitently believe on his Name, might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and saved from Eternal Death.
<PB N="40" REF="000879_0041_0FAC950670870110">
That Sentence of Death which is passed on you as to your Body, cannot be re|versed; but the Sentence of Everlasting Death may. As yet it is possible that you may be saved from the <HI>Second Death.</HI> There is merit enough in the Death of Christ to make atonement for as great Sinners as you are. His Blood is a <HI>Foun|tain set open for Sin and for Uncleanness.</HI> Zech. 13.1. But to whom is it set open? To <HI>them that mourn</HI> in Jerusalem. Thy heart has been an Hell of Sin: A Sink of Uncleanness, but if thy heart be broken for your sins, the opened Fountain of the Blood of Christ will make that horribly defiled Soul to become pure, and it shall live. The Lord Jesus Christ excludes none from partaking in the Salvation purchased by the price of his Blood, be|cause they have been great Sinners. He came into the world to save the chief of Sinners. As great sinners as ever lived in the world, upon their repenting and be|lieving on his Name, have through the exceeding abundant Grace of God, had all their sins forgiven.

This will appear, if we consider who they are that do thus.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They that have little or no remorse for Sin.</HI> Who lay not sin to heart when Com|mitted either by themselves or others.

<PB N="50" REF="000879_0051_0FAC950E15CC8548">
few in the world that lay sin to heart as they should do. The Prophet complained that there were in a manner none. Jer. 8.6. <HI>I hearkned and heard, but no man repented of his wickedness, saying what have I done.</HI> There are great sins, which but few have a due sence of their guiltiness before God in re|spect of them. <HI>Adams Sin</HI> was a great one: An hainous transgression is expressed, by saying, <HI>Like Adam they have transgressed the Covenant.</HI> Hos. 6.7. He sinned against a positive Express Commandment to the contrary. <HI>Hast thou Eaten of the tree where|of I commanded thee that thou shouldest not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at,</HI> said God unto him.

God had been so bountiful as to give him free leave to eat of all the Trees in <HI>Eden</HI> excepting one, he would be Stealing that too. Yet this grievous sin is by a Righte|ous <HI>Imputation</HI> the sin of every man. The Papists say of their <HI>Bonaventure, In hoc ho|mine non peccavit Adam,</HI> that he had no guilt of <HI>Adams</HI> sin upon him. But the A|postle tells us, that <HI>in Adam all have sinned.</HI> Rom. 5.12. Yet how few are there that have any sence of their guiltiness on the account of this great iniquity? Or, that did ever mourn before the Lord for it? That which we commonly (from <HI>Austin</HI> who first and fitly gave it that Name) call <HI>Original Sin,</HI> or (as the Apostle expresseth it) <HI>the Sin which dwells in us,</HI> is no little evil. That corruption of nature which men bring into the world with them, is evil beyond all expression. The Apostle sayes that <HI>Sin taking Occasion by the Com|mandment wrought in him all manner of Con|cupiscence.</HI> Rom. 7.8. Such wickedness is there in the nature of men, that because the Commandment sayes, you shall not do such a thing, they are the more set upon doing it.

Jews and Papists in their writings will hardly own it to be a sin. And there are many who never did shed one tear, or send one sigh up to Heaven, because of the guiltiness of their Souls before the Lord, by their Ori|ginal Corruption. The sin of unbelief or disobedience to the Gospel is a great sin. The Spirit of God will one day <HI>Convince the world of Sin,</HI> that is to say, Convince them that they have been guilty of a great and hainous sin, <HI>because they have not be|lieved on Christ.</HI> Joh. 16.9.

There is no man that has not been guilty of numberless Actual Sins. <HI>David</HI> was sensible of this: he saw his sins were like a mighty Army which he could not see to the end of them, and <HI>his heart failed him,</HI> he was ready to dy away at the sight of them.

The holy Apostle reproveth the <HI>Corinthians</HI> in that when one in their Communion was found guilty of Incest, <HI>they had not Mourned.</HI> 1 Cor. 5.2. They would have done well to have set some time apart to Fast and Mourn because of the dishonour done to the Name of Christ, and the wound which Religion received by means of that Scandalous person. The

Psalmist could say, not only that he <HI>beheld the Transgressors and was grieved,</HI> but that <HI>Rivers of waters run down his Eyes because men kept not the Law of God.</HI> Psal. 119.136. How few can say after him?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They that seek to Excuse and Extenuate Sin, make too light of it.</HI> Thus our first Parents did. The woman who was first in the Transgression, would lay the blame at the Serpents door: <HI>The Serpent beguiled me.</HI> Thus <HI>Eves</HI> Children think to Excuse or Extenuate their sin by laying the fault on the Devil. Why would you do such an evil thing? The Devil Tempted me say they. The man sought to make some excuse for himself by accusing his Wife&punc; &amp; silently reflected on the providence of God, <HI>The woman whom thou gavest me she gave to me of the Tree and I did eat.</HI> Gen. 3.12. Thus sinners to Extenuate their Crimes will reflect upon God: They say, If God had given me Grace, I should not have done so wickedly. Ever since <HI>Adams fall</HI> it has been natural for men to excuse and extenuate their faults either by blaming others, or by some other pretext. When <HI>Aaron</HI> committed a great Sin in making the Calfe in the Wilderness, what a frivolous excuse did he make for him|self,
<PB N="55" REF="000879_0056_0FAC951260050198">
that the people brought him some Gold, and he cast it into the fire, <HI>and there came out a Calfe.</HI> Exod. 32.24. As if it had been only by <HI>Chance</HI> and not of <HI>Choice</HI> that a thing like a Calfe came out of the fire. The Jewish <HI>Rabbis</HI> in their writings excuse that fact of <HI>Aaron,</HI> pretending that he de|signed not to make such an Idol, but that there was an Extraordinary operation of the Devil in that matter; but this fiction of theirs is against the Scripture, which declares the activity of <HI>Aaron</HI> in the form|ing of that Idol. <HI>Verse</HI> 4. <HI>He fashioned it with a graving tool</HI>: but then he had ano|ther excuse to lessen his Crime. <HI>Verse</HI> 22. <HI>Thou knowest the people they are set on mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chief:</HI> he would lay all the fault at their door. If a good man, a <HI>Saint of the Lord,</HI> as <HI>Aaron</HI> was, will when under Temptati|on find excuses for great sins, will not sinners do so much more? We read con|cerning <HI>Saul,</HI> when he spared <HI>Agag</HI> &amp; the <HI>Amalahites</HI> substance, contrary to the Ex|press Commandment of God, he endeavour|ed to extenuate his Crime, by pretending that he was afraid to displease the peo|ple. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15. 24. <HI>I have transgressed the Commandment of the Lord, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</HI> And he

had another excuse, <HI>viz. that the best of the sheep and of the oxen were spared for Sacrifice unto the Lord.</HI> vers. 15. Thus men think to extenuate the evil of their sin, by pretending that they intended no hurt in what they did: But Sin is such an Evil, as the best intention in the world can never make it to be good. Others think to excuse what they have done a|miss, by pretending that if it were sin, yet it was no great sin. <HI>Ephraim</HI> said, <HI>they shall find no iniquity in me that were sin.</HI> Hos. 12.8. He means, no Iniquity that were a great sin. Nevertheless, <HI>he loved to Oppress</HI>; but thought that such Oppression as that which the Prophets charged him with, was no such great sin. Men are apt to say of their sins, as <HI>Lot</HI> said of <HI>Zoar,</HI> Gen. 19.20. <HI>It is a little One? Is it not a little One?</HI> They call their sins <HI>peccadillo's</HI>; whereas no sin can be so absolutely consi|dered. Altho some sins compared with others are small, nevertheless, that which is (as the least sin is) an offence against the Infinite Majesty, cannot be a little Evil. Papists have invented distinctions to make their sins appear little&punc; Some are <HI>venial</HI> they say, and not <HI>mortal</HI>; so they distinguish Lies into <HI>pernicious</HI> and <HI>officious.</HI> As if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

He feared the Lord from his youth; nevertheless could remember some sins and vanities of his youth; &amp; a sorrowful (not a pleasant) remembrance it was to him. He would not tell of the vanities of his youth to make others merry. There are some that take pleasure in seeing others sin; which argues an high degree of Impiety.

<HEAD>PROPOSITION. III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That Sinners are Fools.</HI> The things which
<PB N="68" REF="000879_0069_0FAC951F35FB9C50">
have been spoken prove them to be so. None but Fools would make a light mat|ter of such an Evil as Sin is. But further to inlarge on the <HI>Probation</HI> of the Truth before us.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Scripture every where speaks of Sinners as of Fools. How often are they in the Holy Writings, (in the Book of <HI>Iob</HI>; and in the <HI>Psalms,</HI> and in <HI>Proverbs,</HI> and <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI>) called <HI>fools.</HI> The Scripture says of them that they are <HI>foolish.</HI> Psal. 5.4. <HI>The foolish, i. e.</HI> Sinners <HI>shall not stand in thy sight.</HI> When they come to be tryed for their lives before Gods Tribunal, they will not be able to stand in the judgment. The Hebrew word <HI>HOLEPIM,</HI> there Transla|ted <HI>foolish,</HI> signifieth <HI>mad men,</HI> or such as rave with folly; Sinners are subject to <HI>moral madness</HI>: If they were not raving mad they would never do as they do. Madness is in their hearts as long as they live, and after that they go to the dead, nay, to the damned. Sinners are said to be without knowledge. Psal. 14.4. <HI>Have all the workers of Iniquity no knowledge.</HI> Truly, there is not one of them all that has any saving knowledge; such of them as are wise to do evil, to do good they have no knowledge. Isa. 27.11. <HI>It is a
<PB N="69" REF="000879_0070_0FAC951FE0266860">
people of no understanding.</HI> They are called <HI>simple ones.</HI> Prov. 1.22. <HI>How long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity.</HI> Hence the Scrip|ture compares them to Beasts, because they act as if they were devoid of all reason or rational understanding. Psal. 49.10. <HI>Wise men dy, likewise the bruitish person:</HI> Who but a Sinner is that <HI>bruitish person?</HI> A Sin|ner is resembled to the most stupid of all Beasts; To the Ass, to the wild Ass, nay, to the wild asses colt. Job 11.12. <HI>Man is born like the wild asses colt.</HI> A Sin|ner is a born fool: They are compared to the silly Birds, to simple fearful Doves. Hos. 7.11. <HI>Ephraim is like a silly Dove without heart.</HI> Yea, they are compared to Ostriches. Lam. 4.3. The Ostrich is both a very foolish and an unnatural Bird.

She has been hardned against her young one, as if it had not been hers. Yea, though it was crushed to death she regarded it not. True spiritual wisdom and understanding is in fearing the Lord, which is contrary

to sinning against him. Psal. 111.10. <HI>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and a good understanding have all they that do his Commandments.</HI> As for Regenerate Souls, God has made them to know wis|dom in the inward parts. They that are wise unto Salvation are wise indeed; and therefore Godly men are the only wise men, and will be found to be so at last. Yea, wiser than the greatest Clerks or Politicians in the world, that have not Grace in their hearts. A man may excel in political wisdom, and in philosophical wisdom, and yet a poor illeterate obscure person, that makes no figure in the world, but Loveth and Serveth God and Jesus Christ, will be found a wiser man than the other, because of his being wise unto Salvation; which is the only true wisdom. It is rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted concerning two Learned men, that as they were Travelling to the Coun|cil of <HI>Trent,</HI> they espied a poor Shepherd in the Woods, with Tears running down his Cheeks. They asked him the reason of his weeping, who replied, you may see there an ugly Toad: I cannot but weep, to think of the goodness of God towards me, who instead of making me a Toad, has made me a man with a rational Soul
<PB N="71" REF="000879_0072_0FAC9522CCCFDC88">
capable to know, and love, and serve God. At this the two Learned men fell a wee|ping too, saying to one another, this poor illeterate Shepherd will go to Heaven when he dyeth; for he loveth God and serveth him; but we with all our Learn|ing are like to go to Hell: He is an hap|pier and wiser man than we are. So then there is no Sinner in the world that is a wise man, if we speak of true hea|venly wisdom. For,</P>
<P N="2">2. Sin is the greatest Folly. Psal. 85.8. <HI>Let them not turn again to folly, i. e.</HI> to Sin. Prov. 8.11. <HI>As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool returns to his folly.</HI> A Dog has not the reason to consider and think with himself, that the thing which he vomi's up, was it which made him sick, &amp; there|fore he returns to it again. Just so it is with Sinners. It may be they have felt pain by their sins, their Bodies have been hurt thereby: And it may be their Con|sciences have smarted for what they have done; yet they will commit those Sins a|gain. Thus do they return to their fol|ly. Such fools are they. All Sin is folly: For it is against the rules of wisdom: All the Precepts contained in the Law or Word of God are wise precepts. There
<PB N="72" REF="000879_0073_0FAC95245A61EFD0">
is no Sin but it is a Transgression of one or other of them. Jer. 8.8, 9. <HI>How do you say, we are wise? They have rejected the Word of the Lord, and what wisdom is in them?</HI> Sin is a departure from God the fountain of all wisdom: And therefore the more men sin, the more unwise are they. The greatest Sinners are the greatest fools in the world. <HI>In the greatness of their folly they go astray.</HI> Prov. 5.23. And as all Sin is folly, so there are some Sins which are in a most peculiar manner so. Sins of Uncleanness are most abominable folly. When <HI>Shechens</HI> had defiled <HI>Dinah,</HI> it was said of him, that he had <HI>wrought folly in Israel, which thing ought not to be done.</HI> Gen. 34.7. Sins of that nature bruitify men. They act more like bruit beasts then like men with rational Souls. The wise man speaketh of a young man that was observed to go to the house of an Harlo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, there to debauch himself, of whom he giveth this character, that he was <HI>a young man void of understanding, and that he went after her, as an Ox goeth to the Slaughter, and as a Fool goeth to the correction of the Stocks.</HI> Prov. 7.7, 22. Such bruitish folly are such Sin|ners guilty of,</P>
<P N="3">3. A Sinner has all the properties of
<PB N="73" REF="000879_0074_0FAC952515C3E258">
a Fool belonging to him: he that has all the properties of a Fool is one. That property which the Text before us speaks of is enough to prove the Sinner to be a Fool if there were nothing more. A Fool will laugh and make himself merry&punc; with that which is matter of grief and sorrow. And do not Sinners do so, like mad Fools. Prov. 26.18. <HI>As a mad man who casteth fire brands, arrows, and death, so is the man that deceiveth his Neighbour and sayes, am not I in sport</HI>? A mad man will throw whatever comes next to hand, though it be a Fire brand, or a dart, or any thing else that shall cause death, and makes sport of it: If he wounds his Neighbour for which he ought to be grieved, that is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sport to him And thus it is with some mad Sinners: They will devise slanderous Lyes of their Neighbour to the wounding of his reputation, and then say, they did but Jeast. The good Companionship of rude Sinners, is (as one expresseth it) no better than <HI>Horse play</HI>: They will strike one another. When they are in their drink, and in their mad frolicks, they will tell of one anothers Secret sins, and so expose their Neighbour to reproach &amp; shame: And this is their sport. Mad

People will sometimes when the phrenzy takes them kill their own Relations, and (though they have cause to mourn for what they have done all their dayes) they rejoyce in it. We are informed of a Tra|gical instance of this nature which hapned in a place in <HI>Wales</HI> not five Months ago. A distracted man in a mad fit killed his Wife and all his four Children in one bloody morning, without any remorse for what he had done. Another sad instance there is in this Land is a neighbour Colo|ny: A poor woman now in Prison, cut the throat of her own Son, at which she rejoyceth, imagining that she has notably imitated the Faith of <HI>Abraham</HI> in Sacri|ficing her Son A mad man will some|times cut and wound his own body, and then Laugh at his own misery. And do not distracted Sinners do thus and worse than this? They gash and wound their own Souls by their Sins, and yet laugh at what they have done. It is impossible for a man to make himself Drunk, or Unclean, or to tell a known Lye, without making a wound in his Conscience, which he will be sensible of whenever he shall come to himself and see his undone Soul bleeding to death.

at their own misery, which declares their folly and madness. Besides this which is expressed in the Text before us, there are other properties of a Fool to be affirmed of him that is a Sinner. <HI>e. g.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Indocibility is the property of a Fool. He is unteachable: Suppose he should have the best Instructors in the world, he will not learn wisdom, nor get understand|ing. The Sinners amongst the Jews had Prophets to Instruct them, and yet they would not Learn. Isa. 28.13. <HI>The word of the Lord was unto them&punc; Precept upon Precept, Line upon Line, here a little and there a little&punc;</HI> God dealt with them as we do with Chil|dren that must learn first one line &amp; there another, and but a little at a time. And or all that, they would learn nothing: They were ever Learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth; so unteachable were they. If a Fool be Corrected as well as Instructed, yet he will not learn. There is no beating of knowledge into him: And is it not so with Sinners? There is many a Sinner that has smarted for his sin &amp; folly, &amp; yet he has not the sence to reform hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wayes. Many a drunkard that has suffered much in his Estate, and in his Relations, and in
<PB N="76" REF="000879_0077_0FAC9526A6A2A7D0">
his Soul and Body, because of that sin, and for all that, he has neither the Grace nor Wit to leave that sin: Though he has been stricken and beaten for it, he will seek it yet again. <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.35. What a Fool is such a sinner? We see every day that what the wise man speaks is true. Prov. 27.22. <HI>Though thou shouldst bray a Fool in a Morter with a Pestle yet will not his foolish|ness depart from him.</HI> In old Time one kind of grinding which people used was to put their parched Corn into a Morter, and so to grind it to powder. The grains of Corn tho' much hardned, would by a Pestle beating it in the Morter be reduced to soft Meal; but a Sinner is such an hard hearted Fool, that though the plagues of the Lord be never so heavy upon him, he will not amend nor leave his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olly. Let him be put into the Morter of Divine wrath, and bruised with the Iron Pestle of Judgments one after another, he is and will be foolish still. Though the Lord has stricken him, he receiveth not Cor|rection, his heart is harder than a Rock, he refuseth to return. Would any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> but a Fool be thus obstinate?</P>
<P N="2">2. It is the property of a Fool to mind only what is present, but to be careless of
<PB N="77" REF="000879_0078_0FAC95276C622308">
what shall be hereafter. A wise man will lay up a good foundation against the Time to come: he'l provide against a rainy day. Prov. 10.5. <HI>He that gathereth in Summer is a wise Son.</HI> He that is wise will in Summer provide against Winter. It is said of the Ants that they are exceed|ing wise, <HI>because they prepare their meat in the Summer.</HI> Prov. 30.25. Alas! Sinners have not this wisdom. They are like beasts without reason who only indulge their present senses, but have no thoughts where they must be, or how they shall live a few years hence. If men were wise they would be often thinking of another world. They would prepare for Death, and provide for Eternity. Deut. 32.29. <HI>O that they were wise that they understood this, that they would Consider their latter end.</HI> They that are wise will consider their latter end. They will remember Death &amp; Eternity. Why are some of the Virgins in the Para|ble called <HI>Foolish Virgins,</HI> but because they did not take care to get <HI>Oyl into their Vessels,</HI> Grace into their hearts, and so be provided and prepared for the day of the Lords coming! There is no sinner in this world, but he must shortly go out of it, and go into another world where he must be for

ever and ever: And yet he remains un|prepared and unprovided for that world. What inexpressible folly is this? I re|member a Reverend Author speaks con|cerning a certain noble man that had a Servant belonging to his Family that was counted a Fool,
<Q>to whom he delivered a Staff and bid him keep that Staff until he should meet with one that was more Fool than himself, and give it to that man: Within a while hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lord fell sick unto Death: His Fool servant comes to him, and sayes, what are you dying?

I must never come again, says his Master, and I shall never see thee any more. And (said the Servant) have you made any provision for that world which you are going into, never to come here again? No, said his Lord, I have not: No (said the poor Fool) then He give you your Staff again, for I my self was never more Fool then so: Not to think of a world to which I must go, and from which I must never return is greater folly than

<P N="3">3. It is the property of a fool to refuse a good offer. When that is offered to him, which would make him happy, if he had an heart and wisdom to embrace it, he foolishly neglects his opportunity. Prov 17.16. <HI>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he has no heart to it.</HI> Thus it is with Sinners: They have Spiritual Riches offered to them in the Gos|pel; they are told of that which will en|rich their Souls, and make them for ever. The <HI>Unsearchable Riches of Christ</HI> will do so. And that is freely offered to them in the Gospel. Where that is preached, God from Heaven makes an offer of his Son to be an Husband and a Saviour to every Soul that will believe on him; but foolish Sin|ners make light of this offer, altho they never had, nor never shall have another offer like unto it. Mat 22.4.5. <HI>All things are ready; come unto the Marriage, but they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his Farm, and another to his Merchandize.</HI> And are not they fools that will refuse an offered Christ for a Farm? And all the Riches of the Son of God, the Heir of all things, for the Merchandize of this world?
<PB N="80" REF="000879_0081_0FAC9529A6702DF0">
Christ also offereth himself in the Gospel, but Sinners refuse him. <HI>Wisdom,</HI> that is <HI>Christ,</HI> complains of this folly in Sinners. Prov. 1.24, 25. <HI>I have called, and ye refu|sed, I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded, but ye have set at naught all my counsel.</HI> And that which addeth to the folly, is, that Sinners do thus again and a|gain, many a time and often. The Lord Jesus Christ is graciously pleased to offer himself to them with all his saving bene|fits, but they continue in their refusals of him. Mat.23.37. <HI>O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w often would I have gathered thy Children together, as an hen gathereth her Chickens un|dor her wings, and ye would not.</HI> Thus did they go on to reject the happiest offer that ever was made unto men.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is the property of a fool to make an ill choice: Not only to refuse a good offer when he may have it, but to take a bad one. It has been the manner in Ci|vil Courts, when any person has been im|pleaded for a fool to try him by offering a piece of Gold and a Counter, something of great value, or an apple; if he chuseth the Counter rather than the Gold, the Ap|ple rather than the Jewel, then he is cast for a fool, and his Estate taken from him,

<PB N="82" REF="000879_0083_0FAC952D5D1B62B0">
do they make, who chuse Hell rather than Heaven! This Sinners do. They love death. When life and death, hea|ven and hell are set before them, they chuse death and hell. Ezek. 33.11. <HI>Why will you dy.</HI> They will, they chuse death in the causes of it: The things which will certainly end in death, are the things which they chuse. For a man to chuse Eternal rather than a Temporal Death, is a very unwise choice. It was well &amp; wisely said by one of our English Martyrs when one tempted him to Conform against the light of his Conscience, to the Superstition of the Times; because he would loose his life if he did not, and (said the Tem|ter) death is bitter, and life is sweet: To whom the Martyr replied, but <HI>Death E|ternal is more bitter, and Life Eternal is more sweet.</HI> Alas! Sinners have not the wisdom to consider this. <HI>Ioshua</HI> said to the Children of <HI>Israel, Chuse you whom you will Serve, but I and my House will serve the Lord.</HI> Thus when it is said to a Sinner, chuse whom thou wilt have to be thy Master; he makes the unhappiest choice that possibly can be: he chuseth the worst Master that ever any one did serve: For he chuseth to be a Servant of Sin: he had

rather be a Slave than a Free man; yea, a Slave to Sin and Satan, then the Lords Free-man.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is the property of a fool to con|tend with one that is too strong for him. A Wise man will sit down and consider with himself, whether he is able with ten thousand, to meet with him that cometh against him with twenty thousand. <HI>Luk.</HI> 14.31. Better sit still then rise and fall. But Sinners have not the understanding to consider this. They are so foolish as to set themselves against one that is Infinite|ly too strong for them. Is a Sinner a fit match for the Almighty? Is he able to make his patty good with that God before whom the Nations are as the drop of a bucket, and counted as the small dust of the ballance, yea less then nothing and vanity? Is he able to make his party good with that God, who holds all the water of the Sea in the hollow of his hand, and who measures Heaven with a span. O Sinner, consider with thy self, what thou will do, when God shall strike thee with those hands which have made heaven and earth. <HI>Do we provoke the Lord to jealousie, are we stronger than he?</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.22. What infinite folly are they guilty of that do so?
<PB N="84" REF="000879_0085_0FAC952EC4536430">
Nevertheless the Sinner does so. Job 15.25, 26. <HI>For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengthens himself against the Al|mighty, he runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his buckler.</HI> The Threatnings and Sanctions of the Di|vine Law are the bosses of his buckler; but the Sinner regards them not. But canst thou stand it out against God? Can thy hands be strong, or can thy heart en|dure in the day that the Lord shall deal with thee? Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? dost thou not know that his Power is Irresistible? When he casts forth his Lightnings, what man is there that can stand before the Thunder of God? It is reported concerning <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igula,</HI> that for all he was <HI>Emperour</HI> of the World, when he heard it Thunder, he would run under his bed to hide himself. Histories inform us of Kings that have been Slain with Lightning when they have been surround|ed with Armies to defend them. Who can stand before the Omnipotent God when once he is angry? Rocks cannot, for the Rocks are thrown down by him, when his fury is poured out like fire. The Fa|mous Island of <HI>Sicily</HI>&punc; saw this to be true
<PB N="85" REF="000879_0086_0FAC952EF4ADEA88">
not many years since. And the Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI> saw it but a few months ago; when Rivers of Fire broke out of a Moun|tain near unto them. <HI>Mountains</HI> cannot stand before his Indignation: For he O|verturns the Mountains in his anger, and those Pillars of Heaven tremble at his re|proof: Nay, Angels the mightiest and most powerful Creatures in the World cannot stand before him: He spared not the Angels that sinned, but cast them down to Hell. It was Inexpressible folly in the Apostate Angels to set themselves against their Almighty Creator? Well might <HI>Eli|phaz</HI> say, <HI>His Angels he charged with Folly.</HI> Job 4.18. If then silly Worms on the Earth shall rise up against him, are they not fools for so doing.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is the property of a fool to make foolish bargains: So does the Sinner do; for he barters away his precious Soul, and that for a thing of naught. There is no Sinner, but he has a Jewel belonging to him, more worth then all this world, namely, his precious and immortal Soul; this he parts with, and what has he in exchange for it? Nothing more than the pleasures of sin for a season. Was it not ext<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eam folly in <HI>Esau</HI> to sell his Birthright
<PB N="86" REF="000879_0087_0FAC952FA6FFCF78">
for a mess of pottage! but what horrible folly is it for a man to sell his Soul for the enjoyment of a sensual Lust? Rather then deny his sensual appetite in respect of a lust of Drunkenness, or of a lust of Un|cleanness, he'll loose his soul. What grea|ter folly can there be then to part with pleasures for evermore in Heaven, &amp; to go into Eternal Torments, and all to enjoy the momentany pleasures of Sin? It was a sad word which a miserable man once uttered on a death-bed. <HI>I have</HI> (said he) <HI>enjoyed the pleasures of sin for a little while, and now I must be in torment for infinite mil|lions of Ages.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have we seen the Doctrine open|ed and confirmed in the particulars which have been mentioned. For the Improve|ment of it, we shall speak a few things briefly. Let the first <HI>USE</HI> be for <HI>In|struction,</HI> in two particulars.</P>
<P>Inf. 1. <HI>What folly are they guilty of who make light of the greatest Sins?</HI> There are those in the world that do so. Profane Swearing is a great Sin: Therefore does the Scripture say, <HI>above all things Swear not, neither by Heaven, neither by the Earth, nei|ther by any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her Oath, lest you fall into Con|demnation.</HI> James 5.12. Yet there are some
<PB N="87" REF="000879_0088_0FAC953073F6CF88">
who make light of this horrible Sin. If they be but a little provoked they'l Curse &amp; Swear like Devils incarnate: And then think to Excuse it, by saying, such an one provoked me. And art not thou a Fool to provoke the Eternal God, only because thy Neighbour has provoked thee? There are <HI>Oaths</HI> unto which men to shew how light they make of being guilty of them, have given the Name of <HI>Petty Oaths:</HI> They think that for them to Swear by their Faith and by their Troth is a small evil if any at all: but it is a great Sin to do so. All Swearing by Creatures is a grievous sin. To <HI>Swear by things that are no Gods</HI> is great impiety. <HI>Ier.</HI> 5.7. But the man that Swears <HI>by his Faith &amp; Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th,</HI> Swears by things that are no Gods How shall the Lord pardon them for this without Re|pentance.

Yet are there not those that make a mock of this Sin. Yea, that will make others Drunk on purpose, that so they may have something to laugh at, and to make themselves sport with.

What stupendous folly is it, to Commit the most disgraceful Sins without either remorse or shame, especi|ally for persons of Quality to do so, who ought to be Examples of Vertue. When <HI>Thamar</HI> was Sollicited by a Courtier and a Royal Person to Consent unto a great Sin, she said, (and it was well and wisely spoken) <HI>And I whither shall I cause my shame to go; and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel.</HI> 2 Sam. 13.13.

There was a great instance hereof in the late Earle of <HI>Rochester,</HI> who had been as great an Atheist as perhaps was in King <HI>Charles</HI> his Court. But when God opened his eyes on a death-bed, he said to his former Companions: (and gave it un|der his hand that it might make the great|er impression on them) he warned by me, as ever you regard the welfare of your immortal Souls, <HI>no more to mock at sin.</HI> And another late Example like to this was in <HI>Sir Alan Broderick,</HI> who had been one of the greatest <HI>Debauches</HI> of this Atheistical age, but when he was dying he bewayled his having spent so great a part of his Life in the <HI>Sports and follies of Sin,</HI> professing that now he saw <HI>the Folly and Unreasonable|ness of Sin,</HI> so as that no Temptation in the world could prevail with him to sin any more as formerly.</P>

If he had not been mad he would never have done so; but he saw his folly in departing from his Fathers house where he had bread enough and to spare, &amp; in bringing upon himself poverty, and mise|ry, and death. Or, if Sinners are not in a way of unfeigned Repentance, made to see their folly whilst they are in this world, they will see it and lament it for ever in

Thus when Sinners shall be cast into that Dungeon where is <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ackness of darkness for ever,</HI> they will be made sen|sible of their folly. Therefore we should pitty and mourn over them: They that are Regenerate and made wise unto Salvation, should pitty the folly of unregenerate ones, and the rather because they themselves once were such. Tit. 3.2, 3. <HI>Let us shew all meekness towards all men, for we our selves were sometimes foolish.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE</HI> 2. Let us be <HI>Exhorted to practise as the Doctrine calls for.</HI> And how is that? <HI>Ans.</HI> Instead of many particulars, I shall mention but two.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Doctrine calls upon us to be deeply humbled for Sin. What has a fool to be proud of? No Sinner has cause to be proud of any thing, but to come down and sit in the dust before the Lord all his dayes. It is an humbling thing to be left to an act of folly, but what then is it to have an heart full of nothing else but fol|ly? so has the Sinner. Rom. 7 18. <HI>I know that in me, that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
<PB N="92" REF="000879_0093_0FAC95343615BFB8">
thing.</HI> They that are only flesh, that have nothing but nature in them, have nothing but sin and folly dwelling in them; and they have been guilty of innumerable acts of extream folly, the thought whereof ought to humble them. Every Sinner may make <HI>Sauls</HI> confession. 1 Sam 26.21. <HI>I have sinned, I have played the fool, I have erred exceedingly.</HI> Sinners have been doing nothing but <HI>playing the fool</HI> all their dayes. For what have they been doing? What have they been thinking of? What have their cares been exercised about all their dayes? only or chiefly about their Bodies, and not their Souls; not how they may make sure of Heaven, but how they may live, and get Estates on the Earth. <HI>This their way is their folly.</HI> Psal. 49.13. And they into whose hearts God has put spiri|tual wisdom, have cause sad enough to walk humbly all their dayes, remembring what fools once they were. <HI>Remember what you were in times past.</HI> Eph. 2&punc;11. How sinful, how foolish! There was a Time when you had no spiritual wisdom in you; a time when you were in igno|rance; a time when you knew not God. Let us remember those dayes. and the fol|ly of them, and let the thought of them
<PB N="93" REF="000879_0094_0FAC9536D1B04260">
keep us humble as long as we shall have a day to live. Moreover, there is a great deal of folly still remaining in the wisest and holiest heart on the earth: We see it in <HI>David,</HI> a man wise like an Angel of God, yet what pride and folly did he discover in causing <HI>Ioab</HI> to number the people, which he himself was very sensible of afterwards, confessing his sin and folly, and begging pardon for it. 2 Sam 24.10. <HI>Lord, take away the iniquity of thy Servant, for I have done very foolishly.</HI> We see the like in <HI>Hezekiah.</HI> What foolish pride did that wise and good man discover to be in his heart, when the Ambassadors from <HI>Babylon</HI> came to him. God left him that he might know what was in his heart; And he saw such pride and folly there, as brought him upon his knees before the Lord. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 32.26. <HI>Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart.</HI> And the Truth is, that the more wisdom and grace any man has in his soul, the more has he of a deep and humbling sence of the folly which is in his heart. This we see in the holy Psalmist, who expresseth him|self with such humble words as those, in Psal. 73.22. <HI>So foolish was I and ignorant, I was as a beast before thee.</HI> And we see
<PB N="94" REF="000879_0095_0FAC953789246888">
it in <HI>Agur.</HI> Prov. 30.2, 3. <HI>Surely I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ruitish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man, I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the Holy.</HI> Such a deep and humbling sence had he of his own weakness, and want of wis|dom.</P>
<P N="2">2. Oh turn from Sin immediately. If Sin is folly, then to turn from Sin unto the wayes of Holiness, is wisdom. Sin|ners leave your folly. You will never be wise until you turn from sin. Oh then, cease to do evil, and learn to do well: And do it now&punc; The voice of the Pro|phe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of God in all their Sermons was, <HI>Turn ye now every one from his evil way,</HI> Jer. 25.5. You can't turn from sin too soon, but you may think of turning when it will be too late. Why will you retain such an enemy as Sin? If a man should have a Serpent in his bosome, would he not get rid of it immediately. Sin is such a Serpent; it will fling thee to death, if thou doft not make haste to get clear of it. To delay this matter is dangerous fol|ly. If <HI>Lot</HI> had delayed his going out of <HI>Sodom</HI> one day longer, he had lost his life. So has many an unhappy man lost his Soul, by delaying his Repentance one
<PB N="95" REF="000879_0096_0FAC9539528E9088">
day. Oh stay no longer lest haply the day of grace should be ended, and the door of mercy shut against thee. Remem|ber the Foolish Virgins, who when it was too late cryed, <HI>Lord, Lord, open to us.</HI> What is the dismal cry of the Damned in Hell for ever? Yea, what is the cry of those that have gone out of our Congregations, from the hearing of Sermons to Hell? Is it not this? Wo are we for ever, because we did not Turn from sin soon enough? Wo unto us for ever, because we delayed our Turning from sin! we thought we would repent some time hereafter, but before that time came, Death Seized on us, and now it is too late. Oh that Sin|ners would consider this&punc; Oh that they would be wise unto Salvation. <HI>Turn now</HI> unto God in Jesus Christ, and all your past sins and follies shall be forgiven. And for your Encouragement in Turning to the Lord, remember that God has promi|sed, that his Elect shall Turn into the way of Hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ness, <HI>and the wayfaring men though fools shall not err therein.</HI></P>
