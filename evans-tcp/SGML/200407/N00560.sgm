<HEAD>SOME Seasonable Considerations For the good People of CONNECTICUT</HEAD>
<P>I Remember there was Advice given us in the Year 1689. when we were about to make our Revolu|tion, (as 'tis called) and for ought I know it had been good for us that we had taken it. But we are so un|willing to be &agrave;dvised, and so ill affected to any that tell us the Truth, that there is little Encour&acirc;gement for any to expose themselves in that kind for the future. The Prophet sayes, <HI>The Prudent shall keep Silence, for it is an evil time:</HI> And the greatest of Prophets hath-said, <HI>Cast not your Pearls before Swi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t they turn again and rent you.</HI> But I would hope the case is not yet so desperate. And I remember it is also said, <HI>Thou shalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart, thou shalt in any wise rebuke him, and not suffer sin upon him.</HI> And me thinks no reasonable Creature should look upon a Perswasion to <HI>Consideration</HI> as if it were evil

Council, or did proceed from ill Will. Therefore I will adventure for my Country-men and Brethrens sake to make one Essay.</P>
<P>It was said of Old, <HI>Consider, take Advice, and speak your Minds. Temerity</HI> is always evil, <HI>Consider|ation</HI> is always good, but sometimes necessary. It is requisite that we be always sober and considerate, but especially when we have to do in things that immediately and deeply concern not our <HI>selves</HI> only, but <HI>GOD</HI> and the <HI>KING</HI> too.</P>
<P>With relation to God, it is said, <HI>Be not rash with thy Mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God,</HI> Ecles. 5. 2.</P>
<P>With reference to the King, <HI>Be not hasty to go out of his sight&mdash;A Wise Mans Heart discerns both Time and Judgment,</HI> Eccles. 8. 3, 5.</P>
<P>With reference to our selves, <HI>Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established,</HI> Prov. 4. 26.</P>
<P>Verily, we have cause of Consideration. He is a stranger in <HI>Connecticut</HI> that knows not what hath lately been done there. Let us first reflect, and see what we have done, and then examine and consider it.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="000688_0003_0FA9A275B7C52538">The last Year their Majesties gave a Commission of Lieutenancy to his Excellency Sir <HI>William Phips,</HI> Kt. Captain General and Governour in chief of their said Majesties Province of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> in <HI>New|England,</HI> whereby he was constituted their Majesties Lieut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Commander in chief of the Militia, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> in <HI>Connecticut.</HI> But upon Notice hereof a General Assembly was called, and met, and there it was resolved, <HI>Not to submit to it, nor to take any notice of Sir</HI> William Phips <HI>in that capacity.</HI> Afterward, at another General Assembly we resolve to address their Majesties forth|with, and in the mean time request Sir <HI>William Phips</HI> thereupon to suspend the Execution of his Commis|sion till we can have an Answer from their M&Aacute;jesties: Yet no Address is made to their Majesties, as was pretended. After which, Sir <HI>William Phips</HI> making some further Demands in the Spring, 1693. we pro|mise to pay him some hundreds of Pounds and to take upon us th&eacute; Defence of th&eacute; upper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon this River, belonging to the <HI>Massachusets;</HI> as if these things would satisfie their Majesties Commission.</P>
<P>This Year (1693.) Their Majesties give a like Commission to his Excellency <HI>Benjamin Fletcher,</HI> Captain General and Governour in chief of their Ma|jesties
<PB N="4" REF="000688_0004_0FA9A2767653B318">
Province of <HI>New-York</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> whereby he is con|stituted their Majesties Lieutenant and Commander in chief of the Militia, and of all Forces by Se&agrave; and Land in their Majesties Collony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and of all Forts and places of Strength within the same.</P>
<P>But upon Notice hereof the Free-men and Souldiers in the several Towns are convened, to see how they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> affected, and what they will contribute towards addressing their Majesties in this behalf. A General Assembly also is called, and meets, and there it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, Forth-with to send an Agent to <HI>England</HI> to intreat their Majesties favour in this and other resp&egrave;cts, also<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to levy a Tax of a penny in the Pound (in Mony) upon all the People in the Collony, to defray the charge of it, and that whatever more it amounts to, shall be paid out of the publick Treasury; and <HI>lastly,</HI> That if any such Commission do come in the the mean time, they will not submit to it, but oppose it, till they have an Answer from their Majesties.</P>
<P>By these Methods the Free-men of the Corporation, and as many of the People as will fall in with them, are ensnared and strongly pre-engaged to make Oppo|sition against their Majesties Commission. Insomuch than one Jeers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> another will spend his Blood to keep off his Excellency, another will scruple no more to
<PB N="5" REF="000688_0005_0FA9A278836A8300">
shoot him than to shoot a Deer, and can very well find in his heart to spend a brace of Bullets upon him; beside other Flouts. At length the Commission arrives and comes to his Excellency's hands. In pursuance thereof he speedily takes a Journey to <HI>Hartford</HI> in the time of our General Assembly held at <HI>Hartford, October</HI> 12. 1693. and causes his Commission to be publickly re&agrave;d in the said General Assembly, and in their Majesties Nam&eacute; requires and presses Obedience to it, and gives us all reasonable satisfaction and encou|ragement for that end. In particular, to prevent Mistakes, and in order to a good accomodation, his Excellency leaves his Memorial of his Expectation with us in Writing, desiring our Answer to it in Writing; and then further assures us, <HI>That he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ath neither power nor intent to invade our civil Liberties: That in case of our Submission he would commissionate all that were in Commission before, and take our advice for the supply of vacant places:</HI> and particularly, tenders a Commis|sion to o&ucirc;r Governor for the command of all the Militia in the Collony, only in subordination to this Their Majesties Commission.</P>
<P>But what is the Effect of all? Why! the Deputies (divers of them at least) being so pr&eacute;pared, as afore|said, are resolved before hand, and have determined the
<PB N="6" REF="000688_0006_0FA9A279426D8560">
Question before the Court meets; <HI>God hath given them such a Priviledge, and therefore if their Ma|jesties put such things upon them, they must oppose and hold their own, they are bound in Conscience to do it.</HI> When his Excellency comes to the General Assembly, to publish his Commission, Order is given to the Hal|berte&eacute;rs, <HI>To admit none but his Excellency and his Retinue;</HI> as if it were not meet that their Majesties Commission should be known to the People, who therefore were kept back, and not admitted without hot bickering, nor till after great part of the Commis|sion was read; and no marvel, the General Assembly themselves not ever-willingly give the Commission the hearing, take no great Notice of his Excellency, wave the business, would bring him to composition, (as they had done by Sir <HI>William Phips</HI>) and will not yeild Obedience to the Commission, but instead thereof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Orders to such as command the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rts, to prevent then Seisure; and it seems (if the common same be true) it is their Opinion, <HI>That their Majesties have nothing to do with us.</HI> Hereupon some will not take Commis|sions from his Excellency, others, who otherwise would, are deterred, that they dare not. And for the more common f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rt of People, One maliciously slanders and reviles his Excellency, another basely Libils him,
<PB N="7" REF="000688_0007_0FA9A279783DEF18">
others rudely affro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> him; yea, some rise in Arms to oppose him, and others are in readiness, upon Occasion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to do the same. Such of the Assembly as moved for a Submission, are thought unfit to be Magistrates or Deputies any more: and such of the people as show their Resolution to p&agrave;y their Allegiance to their Ma|jesties, and yeild Obedience to their Commission, are traduced as <HI>Rogues,</HI> that would undo the Country, and accounted scarce worthy to live.</P>
<P>His Excellency some-what surprized (as well he might) at this strange carriage of the King's Subjects; his Country-men and prosessed <HI>Christians</HI> &amp; <HI>Prot&eacute;stants,</HI> and having but six or seven Persons attending on him, thinks it most conducive to their Majesties service to demur a while, hoping that we will bethink our selves, and withal leaves a Proclamation pursuant to his Com|mission with C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> (in the Governour's absence) requiring him to deliver it to our Governor, in order to the immediate Publication of it in the several Counties<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> And upon our Governour's Return, his Excellency did demand, whether he had received the same? which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> owned. And thereupon his Excellency required him to give due Obedience thereto. But it is now above a Month since, and yet we have no more of it.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="000688_0008_0FA9A27A3A3E56E0">Soon after his Return to <HI>York,</HI> his Excellency saw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">se to issue forth a second Pro&ccedil;lamation, given at <HI>Fort William Henry, November</HI> the 8th, 1693. pur|suant to the same Commission and former Proclamation; and sent it (as we are informed) to our Governour, requiring him forth-with to publish it in the chief Towns, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> to the intent that the People might not be deluded and kept in ignorance. But it is now above a Moneth since th&eacute; date of that also, yet we hear no|thing of such publication of it, only there is a printed copy or two of it casually come to the sight of some.</P>
<P>And whereas by the Public&agrave;tion of this their Majesties Commission all former Military Commissions are ex|presly determined, Hereupon arose a Question and Doubt, <HI>Whether we had best to muster, and call men to Arms for Military Exercise as formerly?</HI> Yet upon deliberation it is resolved upon, and in divers places Souldiers are commanded to muster, and are trained as confidently &agrave;s ever; and which is yet more, it is said, that after all this, we have taken upon us to create a Major too. Thus we make all the Defiance to their Majesties and their Commission, Trample them into the very Dirt, and Offend with as high an Hand as is well possible for us to do.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000688_0009_0FA9A27AF4BC4268">This is the entertainment that their Majesties Autho|rity finds in <HI>Connecticut;</HI> and thus we ethink we have neatly and effectually defeated their Majesties Commis|sion. But we have need to consider it.</P>
<P>There are two sorts of people, (as is &ugrave;sual in such cases) that are guilty of this Error. Some there are of Factious and Turbulent Spirits, and such as are pre|engaged by their Male-feazances, or other personal Interests; and these two wittingly err themselves, and out of Design mis-lead others. Others again there are, (and I would hope the most) that &agrave;re plain honest minded men, who pinning their faith upon other mens Sleeves, and being deluded by divers Artifices indu|striously used for that purpose, do think the matter is right, <HI>and if it were not so, surely such and such whom they take to be godly, wise and able men, would never have had a hand in it;</HI> and therefore think they must and ought to follow them, and do as they do. Thus it was in <HI>Absalom's</HI> Rebellion, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15. 11. <HI>With</HI> Absalom <HI>went two hundred Men out of</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>that were call'd, they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> They were not at all privy to the Plot, knew not <HI>Absaloms</HI> design; if they had they would never have gone with him; but thought it was meet
<PB N="10" REF="000688_0010_0FA9A27BB3D1A7D0">
and honourable to attend upon the Kings Son: No doubt he had his Father's Warrant, or Lisence at least, and indeed so he had, to go to <HI>Hebron</HI> to pay his Vow, but not to move Sedition: This they had no thought or suspicion of; and so they went in the simpli|city and honesty of their Hearts.</P>
<P>And to this simplicity of the he&agrave;rt is too often adjoyn|ed the simplicity of the Head, or Ignorance of the nature of the things men undertake &amp; engage in: Thus it was in King <HI>Charles</HI> the first's time, as we may see in the Regicides, divers of them seem to have been (of themselves) honest and well meaning men, who being out-witted, seduced and over-driven by others, engaged in things too high for them, and which they did not understand, and so became guilty of that most Hellish and Execrable Murther and Treason; and when the poor men came upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ryal, and h&agrave;d their Eyes open to see what they had done, they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">thing to say for themselves, but to confess the Fact, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> knowledge, <HI>That they understood not what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> if they had, they would never have done it, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> deluded, drawn and driven by others beyond the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of their Sphere, and so to beg Mercy.</HI> And a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> thing it is, (and such an Example &agrave;s may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> Admonition of present and future Ages)
<PB N="11" REF="000688_0011_0FA9A27C73132260">
that honest men should be so abused, as to ruin and destroy themselves and Post&egrave;rity by being made other mens Tools and Instruments for the committing of such Wickedness. It must needs go ill with a People when those who t&agrave;ke upon them to be their Leaders, shall cause them to err.</P>
<P>The former sort seem to be Desperate, there is little hope of bringing them to better thoughts: For the latter fort therefore this Essay is chiefly intended. He that is wise is wise for himself, and Wisdom is profit|able to direct: Some men cannot think, but others can; and usually second Thoughts are better than the first. <HI>Peter</HI> wickedly denyed his Lord and Master, and that thrice; but when he thought thereon <HI>he wept bitterly.</HI> Verily it is high time, and <HI>now is the time,</HI> if we can, to <HI>bethink</HI> our selves: Let us therefore seriously consider these things.</P>
<P>1<HI>st.</HI> Consider we, how by these carriages we blemish our Religion, and scandalize the Gospel. We profess Religion, that we are <HI>Christians,</HI> yea, <HI>Protestants, have Christ for our Teacher, and his Word for our Rule.</HI> But what! have we so learned Christ, or have we learned these things of him? Doth the <HI>Christian

Religion</HI> teach <HI>Disobedience</HI> and <HI>Contempt</HI> to <HI>Kings</HI> and their <HI>Ministers?</HI> Will not our <HI>Religion</HI> com|mand <HI>good Manners?</HI> Or doth it make <HI>Loyalty to our Prince &agrave; Crime</HI> and a <HI>Scandal?</HI> We insist very much upon our <HI>Religion</HI> and would be thought to be <HI>Eminent,</HI> and that we do more than others in it: Therefore give me leave to insist a little upon this Consideration.</P>
<P>I may not undertake to play the Divine, but it concerns every <HI>Christian</HI> to keep a good Conscience. <HI>Conscience</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not a Phantasy, nor an Affection, but a <HI>Judgment.</HI> He therefore that will keep a good Conscience must be furnished with good and sound Principles. <HI>Inno|cent Nature</HI> and the <HI>Scripture</HI> are the only Magaziens of good Principles: <HI>Innocent Nature</HI> we cannot now boast of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> but (though we may make a good use of the Reliques of the Light of Nature, and indeed better than we do, yet) we must now go to the Scriptures, and be beholding to them for sound Principles: There we shall find the best Ethicks, and (in my Opinion) the best Politicks too, far better sure, than either <HI>Morellius</HI> or <HI>Matchiavell</HI> can teach.</P>
<P>My Principles, and I think agreeable to the Scrip|tures, teach me these things.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="000688_0013_0FA9A27DF0FF6178">1<HI>st.</HI> That Allegiance to our Prince, is a moral and necessary Duty: It is an indispensible Duty, plainly and frequently commanded there: Prov. 24. 21. <HI>Fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change.</HI> Eccles. 8. 2. <HI>I counsel thee to keep the Kings command, and that in regard of the Oath of God.</HI> Thus Christ in his own Person hath taught us, (if we be his Disciples) <HI>Mat.</HI> 22. 21. <HI>Render to</HI> Caesar <HI>the things that are</HI> Caesar's, <HI>and to</HI> God <HI>the things that are</HI> God's.</P>
<P>The Apostles of Christ tread in the steps of their Master, and studiously vindicate the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> from this Scandal, by the diligent and fervent pressing of the same Doctrine: so <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 13. 1, 2, 5. <HI>Let every Soul be subject to the higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>whosoever therefore resists the Power, resists the Ordinance of God, and they that resist receive to themselves Damnation. Wherefore you must needs be subject, not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience sake.</HI> How is it then that some of our Deputies say, <HI>They must resist and oppose, they are bound in Conscience to do it?</HI> 'Tis true, a false God is in truth no God: An Idol is no|thing in the World; so a false usurped pretended
<PB N="14" REF="000688_0014_0FA9A27EB3ED3298">
Authority is not of God, and so is in truth no Autho|rity; 'tis but &agrave;n Idol, there is no Obedience due to it; and if the King be such an one, they say something: But all lawful Authority is of God, and be that resists resists God: He that disobeys the King, as King, or exercising his Kingly Office, disobeys God. Hence the true <HI>Christian Religion</HI> and <HI>Conscience toward God,</HI> (if we have any) do necessitate us to yeild Obedience to the King and his Ministers. <HI>We must needs be subject, not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience sake.</HI></P>
<P>So <HI>Peter,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 13, 14, 15. <HI>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords sake, whether it be to the King as Supream, or to Governors, as to those that are sent by him,</HI> &amp;c <HI>for so is the Will of God, that by well-doing you may put to silence the Ignorance of foolish men.</HI> And vers. 17. <HI>Fear God, honour the King.</HI> We must do it for the Lords sake; and <HI>such as despise Governments, being presumptuous and self|willed, and are not afraid to speak evil of Dignities, they are the spots and blemishes of Religion,</HI> and reckoned among the worst of men, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 10, 13 <HI>Jude</HI> 8. 12. The Kings Person is <HI>sacred,</HI> he is a God upon Earth, and therefore to be feared, and his Ministers, as such are Honourable; <HI>Who can stretch

forth his Hand against the Lords anointed, and be guiltless, says David?</HI> who when he had but cut off the lap or skirt of <HI>Saul's</HI> Garment, his heart smote him, <HI>I have said, ye are Gods, and Children of the most High,</HI> Psal. 82. 6.</P>
<P>Yea, and this is a part of the Doctrine according to Godliness, commanded to be taught by Ministers of the Word of God, <HI>Tit.</HI> 3. 1. <HI>P&uacute;t them in mind to be subject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Ma|gistrates.</HI> And to my knowledge, this Doctrine hath been preached in <HI>Connecticut</HI> forty Years ago, and more, and then it was accounted sound Doctrine; but now its too much forgotten, and too little practised; yea, now it seems this sound Doctrine will not be endured, 'tis not a season to preach it, because it can|not, at least, will not be born. We want <HI>John Baptist</HI> to preach Repentance, and to turn the Disobedient to the Wisdom of the Just. It was a Man of Belial who said, <HI>We have no part in</HI> David, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and <HI>that lift up his Hand against the King,</HI> 2 Sam. 20. 1. 21.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> That true Religion comprises both Tables of the Law: Though it doth distinguish them, yet it doth not seperate them: <HI>Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and <HI>Love thy Neighbour as thy
<PB N="16" REF="000688_0016_0FA9A2812D9C25C0">
self.</HI> Upon these two hang all the Law and the Pro|phets. So, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear the Lord and the King: Render to</HI> Caesar, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and <HI>Render to God,</HI> &amp;<HI>c. Fear God and Honour the King.</HI> God hath all along joyned these together, it is not for us to put them asunder; we offer Violence to Religion, if we do.</P>
<P>So, <HI>James</HI> 1. 16, 17. <HI>If a Man seem to be Religions and bridles not his Tongue, he deceives his own heart, that Man's Religion is vain: pure Religion and unde|filed before God, is to visit the Fatherless and Widdow,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> That is, true Religion draws Righteousness and Mercy (the Duties of the second Table) along with it, and is evidenced by them.</P>
<P>The Fifth Comm&agrave;nd is the Command of God as well as the rest of the ten, and he that is a Transgressor of th&agrave;t is a Transgressor of all: He that said, <HI>Fear God,</HI> hath also said, <HI>Honour the King.</HI> If therefore a man say, he fears God, and yet dishonours the King, he deceives his own heart, he should not believe him|self, for his fear of God is vain.</P>
<P>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 4, 5. <HI>In the latter days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erilous Times shall come, for men shall be Traitorous, Heady, High-minded,</HI> &amp;&ccedil;. <HI>having a form of Godliness, but denying the Power thereof.</HI></P>
<P>The fear of God will, without doubt, produce a

regard to Man, and bind the hands from unl&agrave;wful Vio|lence, without other Manacles. When <HI>Joseph's</HI> Brethren, having so greatly injured him, as they had done, were fallen into his hands, that he could easily have revenged himself upon them, as he pleased; yet says he, <HI>This do and live, for I fear God.</HI> How much more may any Man, doing nothing but his Duty, promise himself Security among those that fear God. But we have seen that of late in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> which if <HI>Abraham</HI> himself had been here, would have made him say, as once he did to <HI>Abimelech, Because I thought, surely the fear of God is not in this place.</HI></P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> That the second Command or Table of the L&acirc;w is like to the first, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22. 38, 39. Man is the Image of God, being made in his likeness, and the King is the Image of God by way of Eminency: He is a created Ray of the divine Majesty and Soveraignity, the next and immediate Deputy of God among men; <HI>to whom God hath lent his own Throne, and put his Name upon him,</HI> Psal. 82. So the Duties of the second T&agrave;ble are like to the Duties of the first. <HI>Duty to Parents</HI> is called <HI>Piety,</HI> 1 Tim. 5. 4. for its likeness to it, and evidence of it. And (as <HI>Peter du Moulin</HI> says very well) <HI>Then will the Power of Kings and Magistrates
<PB N="18" REF="000688_0018_0FA9A282706776D8">
be sound and safe</HI> [and I may add, then, and not before will Religion too be sound and safe] <HI>when Obedience due to Princes shall be thought to be a part of piety, and when the Pastors of the Church shall train up the people by the Word of God, to perform Obedience to them.</HI> And so, on the other hand, the Sins against the second Table &agrave;re like to the sins against the first. <HI>Re|bellion is as the sin of Witchcraft.</HI></P>

The true Church is no Re|bellious City, nor an Enemy unto Kings. A Godly Rebel is a Solicism, a prodigious Monster that true Re|ligion never brought forth.</P>
<P>5<HI>ly.</HI> &amp; <HI>lastly,</HI> My Principles teach me, That as God is absolute Lord and Soveraign, the King of Kings, and is to be obeyed absolutely, and without reserve; so the King is next to God, <HI>Supream upon Earth, chief Governor in all his Dominions</HI> (1 Chron. 29. 22.) and to be obeyed, in subordination, (not in Opposition) to God. Inferior Governors sent by the King, and
<PB N="19" REF="000688_0019_0FA9A2833380D080">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their Authority from him, are to be obeyed, (according to the measure of their Authority) in sub|ordination, not in opposition to the King. We are not to ask Inferior Governors, whether we shall obey the King, or not: The Son is not to ask his Mother, (much less his Brethren and Sisters, or Servants of the House) whether or no he shall obey his Father: No, there is the Law of Nature and express Command of God for it. <HI>Children, Obey your Parents in the Lord, for this is Right, Ephes.</HI> 6. 1. so 'tis in this case. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Be subject to the King, as Supream, for so is the Will of God,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> And the Fathers Authority is paramount to that of the Mother: So is the Authority of the King to that of inferiour Rulers; see <HI>Josh.</HI> 1. 16, 17, 18. <HI>Joshua</HI> was now made chief Governour by God; <HI>Moses</HI> his Successor, who was King in <HI>Je|surun;</HI> and there you see how straitly they bind them|selves to Obedience to him; see &agrave;lso <HI>Ezra</HI> 7. 26. I think these points are Orthodox, and may pass for a Touch-stone, whereby to give a true Judgment of our Profession.</P>
<P>If therefore our Religion be over-grown to that pass, that it teaches us to deny Kings and Magistrates to be of God, untill we can King it our selves, or to deny and absolve our selves from Obedience to them, unless
<PB N="20" REF="000688_0020_0FA9A283EF6CD6B0">
they be of our mind, or will humor us: In a word, if it either be or do teach or toller&aacute;te Rebellion, it is certain it cannot be true; it is high time to renounce it and get a better: Such Religion is a scandal to the Gospel. We shall make the World believe, we have our Religion to seek. It is good for us to read <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. <HI>vers.</HI> 17. to 26. If therefore we desire to credit our Religion, and adorn the Gospel, which we profess, let us consider and return to our Obedience; get good Principles, and put them into practice. Let us look upon Allegi|ance not as an Arbitrary thing, that we may pay it, or we may let it alone, or take our time for it, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> b&ugrave;t let us look upon it as a matter of Necessity. We must needs be subject. If others will not be Loyal, yet we must; and if this make us <HI>Vile,</HI> then we must be <HI>more Vile.</HI> If for this we be <HI>Rogues that will Undo the Country,</HI> then we must be Rogues still.</P>
<P>But possibly all this will easily be avoided: It grows too common an Opinion, <HI>That the King hath nothing to do with us:</HI> &agrave;nd if that be true, I must confess, I am beside the Text. Therefore in the next place,</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> Consider, That of o&ucirc;r own accord, without any Command so to do, we have long since proclaim|ed their Majesties to be our King and Queen. The
<PB N="21" REF="000688_0021_0FA9A284B156D048">
words of which Proclamation do declare their Ma|jesties to be <HI>King and Queen of</HI> England, France <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>with all the Dominio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and Territories thereto belonging;</HI> who are accordingly so to be own|ed, deemed and taken by all the People of the afore|said Re&aacute;lms and Dominions, who are from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ence forward bound to acknowledge and pay to them all Faith and true Allegian&ccedil;&eacute;, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P>We have accordingly in our Addresses to their Majesties, declared, <HI>That we resumed our Government till further Order, and professed our selves to be their Majesties most humble and dutiful Subjects; begged such Directions from their Majesties, as to their Princely Wisdom should seem meet:</HI> Very for|ward and zealous we have pretended our selves to be for the Service and Interest of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>But to what end is all this? Did we not hereby engage Obedience to their Majesties, as our King and Queen? but what Truth and Reality is there in it? for now their Majesties exert their Authority, issue their Commissions, and give us their Directions, they will not be received nor obeyed; as if <HI>their Majesties had nothing to do with us indeed!</HI> Thus in words we profess to acknowledge their Majesties, but in our
<PB N="22" REF="000688_0022_0FA9A2857556B578">
works we deny them. What is this but to mock their Majesties, and bely our selves? Our Actions will signifie more of our Hearts, than our Words: For sh&aacute;me let us make haste to pay our Allegiance. It is a manifest thing that this and the other <HI>Homurculus</HI> hath a thousand times more Authority, Respect and Obedience in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> than their Majesties have. If a Man come in their Majesties Name, and with their Commission, he will not be received by us; but if a man come in his own Name, without their Majesties Authority and Commission, him we will receive: This is not the behaviour of good Subjects. Have we not given our Hands, or do we repent of so doing? Let us deal well and truly with their Majesties. Have we a King, or no King? or, why halt we between two Opinions? If their Majesties be our King and Queen, then let us follow and obey them; but if this &aacute;nd t'other man be indeed Kings, then let us follow them. Let us not flatter and mock, and call their Majesties King and Queen, and pretend they are <HI>Our Dread Soveraigns, our Soveraign Lord and Lady, and We their most Humble and Obedient Subjects,</HI> and make use of their Names to serve our own purposes, and in the mean time refuse to yeild them any Obedience, scorn their Commissions, maligne,
<PB N="23" REF="000688_0023_0FA9A28633A0E758">
contemn and abuse their Ministers. This is palpable Hypocrisie. <HI>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say,</HI> Luke 6. 46. <HI>If I be a Father, where is my Honour? If I be a Master, where is my fear?</HI> Mal. I. 6. If their Majesties be our King and Que&eacute;n, where is our Obedience to them?</P>
<P>Yea, let us deal plainly and uprightly with one another also. We ar&eacute; not willing to be kept in Igno|rance, deluded and led hood-winked, till we are so fast, and unawares entangled in the Snare laid for-our Life, that we shall not be able to get out of it.

But we always understood it in subordination, not in opposition to the King, his Government and Laws, and with a salvo, of all their Majesties Royal Rights. We never intended to Invade the Liberties of our Fellow-subjects, or to use Rigour towards such as were not altogether of our mind, but desired that moderation might be used, and th&agrave;t we might in no sort exceed the Powers sometime granted to us; much less did we intend to invade the

He is blind that hath not taken notice of that notorious Falshood that hath been used, and the innumerable Lyes of all sorts that have all along from time to time been and are still raised and fomented; the advantage that hath been taken of mens Ignorance, and the Endeavours that have been and are used to keep men in the Dark, as if we de|signed to train them up in a blind Obedience to us, beside other ill measures taken; and now at last, such open and resol&ucirc;te Opposition and Defiance is made to

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> it was agreed on all hands, <Q>That the King is raised to the Throne for the <HI>Safeguard of the Law,</HI> and of, <HI>the Bodies and Estates of the Subjects;</HI> and there|fore the Defence is the Kings.

<P>The Designation or Appointment of this or that

Their Majesties may look upon themselves to be very Unhappily and Unequally yoked, as to us: The best of Princes with the worst of Subjects.</P>
<P>9<HI>thly.</HI> Consider we the Time. Is this a time for
<PB N="35" REF="000688_0035_0FA9A290B38D28A8">
us to be Refractory and Disobedient to our Prince? Between four and five Years ago, when there was no War with <HI>France,</HI> we would needs have made the King and and the World believe, <HI>That we were in continual danger of our Lives, by reason of the Natives being at War with us, with whom</HI> (we said) <HI>we had just fears of our Neighbouring</HI> French <HI>to joyn; and therefore not receiving Orders or Directions what Methods to take for our Security, we were necessitated to put our selves into some form of Government.</HI> And yet now there hath been open and strong W&agrave;r with <HI>France,</HI> and with the <HI>French</HI> in all p&agrave;rts above this three Years, and that attended with not a few or small Difficulties &agrave;nd Disappointments, and now that their Majesties have given their Orders and Di|rections wh&agrave;t Methods to take for our Security in this difficult and hazardous Time, there is yet so little danger, that we will not receive their Majesties Directions, but spurn at their Commission, scorn at their Lie&ucirc;tenant, and will yield no obedience.</P>
<P>What! do we indeed intend to fall off to the French? We had as good fall to the French, as fall from our King; and if we intend so to do, let us speak out; if not, surely this is not a time to be Disobedient. For how is it possible for any Prince to

provide for the safety of his Subjects, or to manage the weighty Affairs of War with effect, (and more especially at such a Distance) if his Subjects will flight &agrave;nd disobey his Commissions, or take upon themselves to wage War, without or against them?</P>
<P>10<HI>thly.</HI> We are now addressing their Majesties for their Favour (so we say) and to the end that we may recommend our selves to them as (it seems) their <HI>most Proud and Disobedient Subjects,</HI> at this very time we disobey their Commission. Can we think that <HI>Disobedience</HI> and <HI>Contempt</HI> &acirc;re the most likely way to obtain access and acceptance? Is that the way to find favour? or do we think that the King is afraid of us, and we shall force him to comply with us? Verily, I doubt we shall tempt him and prove him.</P>
<P><HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Pride, Supplication</HI> and <HI>Rebellion</HI> do not sort well together.</P>

<P>12. <HI>Lastly,</HI> Let us consider seriously the end and event of these things, and what may reasonably follow thereupon. <HI>The fools Eyes are in his Heels:</HI> He can see nothing but what is past, and repent when it is too late.

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> To this I answer divers things:</P>
<P>1<HI>st.</HI> We overween our Charter in more things than one, to the no little Prejudice both of King and Subjects. Modesty might incline us to think that the King understands our Charter, and how well the Militia was thereby disposed of, at least as well as we do; and he knows what is his own Right and our Right much better than we. Their Majesties have given us no cause to suspect, that they will take any thing from us that doth of right belong to us. But to let other things pass, let us here consider, That the
<PB N="46" REF="000688_0046_0FA9A299B1DEBD28">
Charter never granted us a standing Militia, but only a Lisence upon occasion of Invasion, or the like, to <HI>array men,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> for our special Defence and safety in such case: The Charter never gave us Power to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and send men &agrave;broad for the Defence and Aid of others.

<P>The Charter never granted us the command of &abreve;ny Forts or places of Strength. Let us examine the Char|ter, and see if we can find th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">se things there.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> Suppose we that all this had been granted by the Charter from King <HI>Charles</HI> the second, and his Successors, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o us and our Successors, yet then the Grant had been void, because the Militia is a Jewel of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Crown, not to be granted by the King from his Successors.

But for us, without their Majesties Notice or Lisence, either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">urrepetitiously or by force, to take and with-hold the Militia from the King, is such a Presumption as I know not who will undert&agrave;ke to justifie or excuse.</P>

<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> It is only our Ignorance that makes us suspect it to be a Cheat.

<P><PB N="49" REF="000688_0049_0FA9A29CB2B0AF40">3 Object. <HI>But if it be not a Cheat, yet the King hath given us no command to surrender the Militia to his Excellency.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ. 1st.</HI> A poor shift! as if their Majesties Commission to his Excellency to command, were not a command for us to obey? or, as if his Excellency's command, pursuant to his Commission received from their Majesties, were not their Majesties Command. He commands in their Majesties Name, and for this he hath their Majesties Authority, Warrant and Com|mission under the great Seal; and do not their Majesties then command us to submit to him?</P>
<P>His Excellency demands no surrender of the Militia of us, but Obedience to his Commission: The Militia is the Kings, and he hath constituted his Lieutenant over it, and thereby furnished him with all the Powers that any of their Majesties Captain Generals do or have lawfully exercised. Now the Kings Lieutenants or Captain Generals may lawfully assemble men, form Regiments, Troops and Companies, commissionate Officers, muster, lead and conduct them, or cause them to be mustered, led and conducted, either for Military Exercise or for actual Service, as occ&agrave;sion
<PB N="50" REF="000688_0050_0FA9A29D78BFC178">
requires: And the Law not only requires Obedience of all, but in particular requires all Officers and Mi|nisters to be aiding and assisting to the Kings Captain Generals in the execution of their Commissions. He hath Power to require assistance of whom he will, and they must assist him at their Peril.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> Did their Majesties ever give their Subjects any command to yeild Obedience to our resumed Power? We lately received a Letter from their Majesties, Did their Majesties therein, or any other|wise give the People any immediate and express Command to obey us in what we were thereupon about to do? Yet we expect Obedience from them, without any such command. And are not we their Ma|jesties Subjects, as well as the rest of the People?</P>
<P>4 Obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>But we cannot manage our Government with|out the Militia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Then we may either go to the King to help us, or let it alone. The Kings Government is more General, more Necessary, more Worthy and more Legal than ours; and how shall the King manage or maintain his Government without the Milita? <HI>Laws</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="000688_0051_0FA9A29E3AE09608">
and <HI>Arms</HI> are necessary in a King, that he may rightly govern the Times both of Peace and War, as &agrave;foresaid. Our Government is but a particular thing, and we may not set our Government in Competition with, much less in Opposition to the Kings Government.</P>
<P>5 Obj. <HI>But we are afraid, that if we let the Militia go, our Government will go too, and we shall be annexed to</HI> York.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> That is no necessary <HI>consequence;</HI> but if it should be so, what then? Whether we be annexed to <HI>York,</HI> or <HI>York</HI> annexed to us, 'tis as long as broad: <HI>York</HI> hath been annexed to us once or twice &agrave;lready, and what hurt did we receive by it? it was in some sort annexed by our Charter, which extended to the South Sea, and then it was (I Suppose with our consent) seperated again. <HI>York</HI> was again annexed to us by the late King <HI>James,</HI> and I know not any detriment that ensued upon that.</P>
<P>We have also once in great measure annexed our selves to <HI>York,</HI> and without question the King may as well annex us to <HI>York,</HI> as we annex our selves. We may remember how readily at <HI>Leysler's</HI> motion, under the pretence of an Expedition against <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> we

Will the King take this well at our hands, that we should obey any man rather than himself? We can willingly submit to <HI>Leysler's</HI> Authority, but stubbornly reject the Kings Commission, and defie his Lieutenant.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> If we renounce the King &aacute;nd his Government we destroy our own: We cannot pretend to any thing but from and under the King: and how can we de|mand or expect that others should obey us, if we will not obey the King? All Loyal Subjects may justly be afraid of having to do with us; for such Obedience is indeed Unlawful.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly.</HI> We cannot think that our Government shall always shoulder out the <HI>Kings</HI> Government; and 'tis not to be doubted but their Majesties have long had the settlement of the Government of these Territories under consideration. The Defence of the Dominion is their Majesties great Interest and care. It is obvious to every Eye that we are divided from the <HI>Massachusets</HI>

<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> We may remember also, That whereas their Majesties did the last year give a Commission to Sir <HI>William Phips;</HI> their Governour of th&eacute; <HI>Massachusets,</HI> we had then the same jealo&ucirc;sie of being annexed to the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> and would not submit to that Com|mission, nor take notice of Sir <HI>William</HI> in that capacity; whereby (to make the fairest construction of it that may be) their Majesties might very well conclude, that we were not desirous to be annexed to the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> but had rather be annexed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &agrave;s being far more convenient.

may well look upon this Commission as the conse|quent of our Non-submission to Sir <HI>William Phips.</HI> It is their Majesties Grace so far to over-look that <HI>Disobedience;</HI> if now we shall finally reject the second, the <HI>Third</HI> may bring a greater inconvenience than any we can imagine to follow upon our being annexed to York.</P>
<P>5<HI>thly,</HI> The Regal and chief Government doth not belong to us: The most that we can pretend to is but that of a Corporation. The Regal Government is the King's, and their Majesties may commit it here or there, as pleases them, and 'tis our Duty to submit.

<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> The Governour neither doth nor can impose any Rates upon them, there is none levyed but what their Assembly of the Free-holders see needful for de|fraying the necessary Charge.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> That small Province of <HI>New-York</HI> hath had (beside other arrears) the burthen of the Defence of <HI>Albany</HI> so long lying mainly upon them alone, by which their Rates, no doubt, have been much more heavy than otherwise they would have been. But have not we great Rates to pay also, now as we are standing alone? And how doth it appear that their Rates are greater than ours? If that m&agrave;tter was well examined, possibly it might be found, th&agrave;t our Rates are as great, if not greater than theirs; and yet we have had no such burden incumbent upon us. How many Thousand of Pounds have been raised upon this Collony since the Revolution? and who is he that can give account of a farthi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g benefit accrewing to this Collony by it, except that little Skirmish at <HI>New|London,</HI> when two or three French Vessels put in there?</P>
