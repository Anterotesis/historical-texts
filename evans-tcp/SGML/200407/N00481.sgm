<HEAD>An Apology for the present Publication of these Things.</HEAD>
<P>WE are sorry that we should have occasion to publish such Account of things, in the open View of all, who may read the following Account, or hear of it, that may be occasion of Grief to many, especially who had better Thoughts of some here-away, than the said Account doth give of them; and it is too probable, the Enemyes of Truth and of all true Religion, will seek to take Advantage there from, and think themselves greatly gra|tified thereby, so as to rejoyce the more in their Iniquity, and glory over the sincere Lovers and Professors of Truth. But as on the one hand, we have been deeply afflicted with sorrow to find some so highly pretending to Truth, and to the inward and immediate Teachings and Leadings of the Spirit of Truth, which they have greatly profes|sed, and some of them have preached for some Years, so very igno|rant and unsound in some of the chief and Fundamental Principles of the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> and <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and so resolute and confident in their Ignorance and Error, that they have from time to time refused and rejected good and seasonable Information, and means of Instru|ction, that have been in love held forth unto them, partly in publick Testimonies, and partly in private Meetings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d Conferences. So after our great and deep Affliction of Sorrow o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> account, and for the sake of many simple People that owned them as Ministers of Christ, whom we saw to be greatly hurt, blinded and darkened with them, but not further enlightned by means of them, notwithstanding of their great and high pretences to Light and Life, and to the Spirit and Power of God inwardly revealed, we can and do sincerely say, on the other hand, God hath greatly comforted us, and we have great joy and consolation in the sence of his Love, revealed and sealed to us by his holy Spirit in our hearts, being perswaded by the same, that according to his Soveraign Wisdom, Goodness and Power, and great Faithfulness, he will make these very things, to wit, the Discoveries that some men have lately given of themselves, to work for good to

many; and we may sincerely and uprightly say, They, and not We, have discovered and made Publick these things; for when they heard true and sound Doctrine preached, concerning <HI>Christ and the true Faith in him, &amp;c.</HI> they have whispered against it, and publickly rejected it, which yet hath been greatly refreshing and edifying to us, and to many others, having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elt the Power of Christ accompanying that Doctrine, and sealing to the Truth of it in our hearts; so that not only we have owned and do own the Doctrine that hath been preached among us, of late Times, by divers that God hath raised up in a zealous Testimony to the Truth of these things (<HI>Denyed</HI> by <HI>some,</HI> and <HI>Rejected</HI> by <HI>others,</HI> and <HI>meanly esteemed</HI> by <HI>too many,</HI> as not Necessary, but Indifferent matters to Salvation, to be believed, though true) but also, we have owned, and do own the Spirit by which that Do|ctrine hath been zealously delivered unto us, being perswaded, it was of God; and we do not judge so rashly and uncharitably as some do, calling that sincere and godly Zeal, that hath appeared in some among us in publick Testimonies, <HI>Anger</HI> and <HI>Passion</HI>: But it is no new thing to hear Light call'd Darkness, as well as Darkness called Light, and Good Evil, and Evil Good; we believe, and are perswaded, that as to the main, it hath been and is a sincere godly Zeal, that hath been of Gods raising in some of our Brethren, both to preach in publick Testimonies this Doctrine, so much of late contradicted by some, and slighted by others, and to defend it with gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t freedom and bold|ness in private Conferences and Meetings, and at some Monethly Mee|tings, notwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hstanding of what humane Weaknesses (as to Circum|stances) might at times, on great Provocations, attend some, that we believe God hath forgiven, which have been far greater on their side, than on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, wherein some of them have exceeded all bounds of Christian Moderation, to the pronouncing <HI>Dreadful Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> against the Innocent (which none of us have done) and giving bad Names to such who did not deserve it; thus putting the Sheep of Christ into Wolves and Bears Skins, to render them odious, and to be the Object of Tongue and Heart Persecution, which too much abounds in this part of the World, although by the Mercy of God, and the good Laws of the Country, Persecution by Violence of the Hands, is re|strained.</P>
<P>Now that these men have been the Discoverers of their own Igno|rance, Error and Unbelief, is very apparent, because they not only
<PB N="4" REF="000606_0004_0FA95D1690E103B0">
dared to whisper against found Doctrine in private, but openly in Meetings appointed to hear these Differences, and even at Monethly Meetings, they have been so bold as to resist found Doctrine, and show their Unbelief; and the Nature of our Meetings being such, especially our Monethly Meetings, that too many come to them and sit in them, hearing all things there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that are not qualified, either with Chri|stian Knowledge or Prudence, or indeed with humane Discretion, as men, to conceal things that are not always seasonable to be published, insomuch that scarce any thing hath been said or done in a Monthly Meeting for a long time past, but it is soon after publickly known: And we desire to reverence the Providence of God, and to acknow|ledge his powerful Hand, Wisdom and Goodness, and great faithful|ness in this Discovery; for we are well satisfied it is far better that the hidden things of <HI>Esau</HI> be searched and found out, than to remain hid; for when <HI>Achan</HI> had Transgressed in the Camp of <HI>Israel,</HI> and had hid the accursed thing, the Anger of the Lord was kindled against them until he was discovered, and Judgment executed against him. And seeing it is so, that many evil and hurtful Opinions, that are as poysonous Weeds, have had too much place among us, but have so secretly lurked under Ground, and yet have brought forth bad Fruit above Ground; for it is the Nature of Errors in Doctrine, to produce Errors of Practice, and evil Conversation of Life, that we did not know that such bad Fruits did spring from such bad Principles of Do|ctrine that were held by them, but we did rather impu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e them to some other Cause, than to Ignorance or Error in Judgment. We have great cause to rejoyce and bless God that his Light hath made this Discovery among us; for the Light discovereth Darkness, as well of Error and Unbelief, in relation to Doctrine, as in matters of bad Conversation; and we are fully perswaded, that it is an infallible sign of that approaching Glory of Gods blessed Day that is more abundant|ly to be revealed among us, and in us, which many of our faithful Friends have fore-told, as nigh at hand, and all the faithful have much longed and wai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed for, and continually pray for. And it will have a service to bring many to Truth, that have stood at a distance, because of Offences and Stumbling Blocks that have been laid in their way, through the Ignorance of many, especially who have professed the Truth with us, after some sort, but have not received the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ue and sound Knowledge of it; and too many that have presumed to preach
<PB N="5" REF="000606_0005_0FA95D181EF988F0">
and pray in our Meetings, their way both of preaching and praying hath been very offensive to many tender-hearted People, by their pre|tending greatly to the Spirits Leadings and Movings, when they have expressed very unsound and unsavoury words, and have greatly dis|covered their unskillfullness in the <HI>Mystery of Christ,</HI> both outwardly as he came in the Flesh, dyed and rose again, and is ascended, and the great benefit of his outward Coming to men, as so known and belie|ved by them, and as inwardly revealed; so that many who have come to our Meetings have been as a hungery Child that greatly needed the Breast, and thirsted for the sincere Milk of the Word, having heard a great Noise of it, but when they came to suck they did not find that which answered their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sire, and went away dis-satisfied, and the Breast it self was so daubed over with what was unpleasant to them, as Mustard or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Sout is to the Mouth or Taste of a sucking Child. But God having so ordered it by his great Love, that by his marvellous Providence discovering these things, that hath been a long and great hurt and hinderance to the prevailing of Truth among u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and causing his Light to spring up more clearly among us, that Christ and the Faith of him, both without us and within us, is sincerely and powerfully preached by some of Gods raising up among us, more clearly and fully than many have formerly known, although the Do|ctrine is the same in matter and substance, that the most faithful and soundest Friends and Brethren have all along held from the beginning; and we are infallibly assured, this present Exercise that is at present so heavy and grievous to many honest hearted for want of a through disce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ning and understanding the Mind and Counsel of God therein, and his blessed Purpose, for the Advancement of his Truth shall greatly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end to their Comfort in due Time, and to the Comfort of many, to raise them up to give Glory to God, with high Praises in their Hearts and Mouthe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, for what he hath begun to do, and will finish and perfect in his own time, for the Exaltation of his own Name, and the Name of his dear Son, that the Mystery of him, <HI>even that great Mystery of Godliness,</HI> which is <HI>Christ come in the Flesh,</HI> and <HI>God manifest in the Flesh,</HI> even in that <HI>Body of Flesh, through Death to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oncile us unto God,</HI> with the blessed Effects and Fruits of it, inwardly witnessed by the Revela|tion of him in us, may be yet more gloriously revealed, that the Souls and Hearts of many may be affected with the same, and overcome therewith, to love him, and live to him, who dyed for them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ose

And though the Adver|saries of Truth may for a small time rejoyce a little, and seem to be gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ified and strengthened in their Enmity against Truth, and the sin|cere Lovers and Professors of it, so as even to seem to glory over the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, yet after a little time their joy will be turned into sorrow, and their great glorying and seeming gratifyings, into Discontents and Fret|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings, when they shall be made to see and acknowledge the Hand of the Lord in all these things (to their great Amazement and Disap|pointment) for the good of all that love him, and the Exaltation of his Name, and promoting Truth and Righteousness in the Earth, that his Kingdom may come in greater Power and Glory, and his Will may be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven. And as for all such who are, by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Spirit, acted to Prophecy false things concerning us (and to pronounce Woes against us) and our present Work and Testimony, as if <HI>both it and we should fall and come to nothing</HI> (as some have done) our Faith and Trust is in God, and our Dependance and Relyance is on him, whose we are, and whom we serve, and for whose Glory and Honour we are zealously concerned in this present Service, with true Humility of Mind, and earnest Prayer unto God, that he will preserve and strengthen us to the end, and make our Almond Rods to bud and blossom, while others that resist the Truth of our Testi|mony will wither; for of a Truth, God is with us, and on our side, whose blessed Power and Presence we feel, to encourage and strengthen us; and therefore let such who gain-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay the Truth of our Testimony, and from a rash, head-strong and wilfull Spirit, make opposition to the same, take heed what they do, lest they be found Fighters against God (for what is of God will stand, let ever so many high and bold Pretenders to that which they are not real Possessors, contradict it) and lest that be fullfilled concerning them, that is written, <HI>Acts</HI> 13.41. <HI>Behold, ye Despisers, and wonder and perish, for I work a Work in your Days, a Work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you,</HI> compar'd with <HI>Hab.</HI> 1.5.</P>
<P>And further, the false Reports and Rumors that are already spread abroad concerning us, by many, laying all fault upon us of this pre|sent Breach and Division, and loading, not only us, but the Truth it self with many false and bitter Aspertions, Reflections and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, will be cause enough (we hope, to all impartial People to whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

<HEAD>Some Reasons and Causes of the late Sepe|ration here at <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe first Cause of the Seperation betwixt them and us, was this, That at a Monethly Meeting held at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> the 29th of the 11th Moneth last, <HI>T.</HI>&mdash; having openly in the face of the Meeting accused <HI>G.

K.) That he had not learned that Less<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, whether the Body of Christ that was nai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oss, crucified, buried, rose and ascended, &amp;c. was the God|head, or some-what that Christ took of the Virgin</HI>; At which many were greatly offended to find him so ignorant, having been so long a Prea|cher.

And by this it plainly appeareth, the Breach was on their side; for there is no Equity or Reason why they having denyed us to be a Meeting, that we should own them, seeing we were really a Meeting, lawfully adjourned, con|sisting of at least Sixty Persons, most of which used to keep Month|ly Meetings, and owned to be Friends in the same Profession with them.</P>
<P>And at the same Monethly Meeting on the sixth Day, <HI>W</HI>&mdash; an antient Preacher, having renewed his former Accusation against <HI>G.K.</HI> charging him openly in the face of the Meeting, <HI>That he preached Two Christs, because he preached Faith in Christ within, and in Christ without us, &amp;c.</HI> and on the next day, at the Meeting adjourned, he being sent for by the Meeting, to make his Charge good, or else condemn his Ignorance and Error, but he refusing to come, the Meeting did also give a unanimous Judgment concerning him (not one dissenting in either of the Judgments, only one or two signifying th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir not through|ly understanding the case, declared thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unclearness, but said nothing against it) the true Copy whereof doth also hereafter follow.

Monthly Meeting, and denyed our Judgment, which we are perswad|ed in our Consciences, by the Spirit of Truth, was a just Judgment concerning these men, and we could do no less, both for the Peace of our Consciences, and the honour of Christ Jesus, and also for the credit of our Profession, in all parts of the World, where such a Profession is made, than to give such a Judgment concerning these Men.

<P>But, that it may appear how weak and insufficient the Reasons are, that were given by the said Party at the Quarterly Meeting, why we were no M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eting, we think fit to give an account of them, with our Answers to them. One Reason was, <HI>That a Monet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly Meeting co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld not adjourn, and there was no President for it:</HI> But to this the Clark of the

Meeting answered, <HI>That he had minuits to show, a Monthly Meeting had formerly adjourned</HI>; And why could not a Monthly Meeting, upon a weighty occasion adjourn, as well as any other Meeting? Another Reason was, <HI>That the Clark and the Monthly Meeting Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k was gone:</HI> But to this it was answered, The Monthly Meeting could make or consti|tute a Clark, as other Meetings have done; for it is the Meeting that makes the Clark, and it is not the Clark that makes the Meeting. A 3<HI>d Reason</HI> was, <HI>There were few o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Ministry, or Elder Friends and Brethren, that were present at the adjourning, or at the Meeting adjourned.</HI> To this it was answered, That there were more, both Friends of the Ministry, and Elder Friends and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rethren at that Mee|ting that did adjourn, and met when adjourned, than hath been at many Monthly Meetings here, that have been approved. A 4<HI>th Reason</HI> was, <HI>That the matter o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Difference being a matter of Doctrine, and be|twixt Friends of the Ministry, a Monthly Meeting could not be proper Iudges o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it.</HI> To this it was answered, That the Difference being a matter of Fact, (and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot a matter of Doctrine that could be called in Question by any Judicious <HI>Christian,</HI>) and the Accusation being made to the Monthly Meeting, they were proper Judges of it; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Differ|ence had been a matter of Doctrine, we did, and do assert, That the Monthly Meeting, to wit, consisting of a considerable Number of F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nds of the Ministry, and other judicious Friends, were proper Judges of it; but to lodge the Judgment wholly in Friends of the Mi|nistry, and to deny all other Friends to have a share in the Judgment, even when the Difference is in a matter of Doctrine, we judge is an encroachment upon our <HI>Christian Liberty,</HI> and savours too much of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>; as also that other ease pressed too indiscreetly at the Quarterly Meeting, when some that were known to be Parties against <HI>G. K.</HI> did require of him his Submission to the Judgment of the Meeting; He answe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed (as we judge, soberly and <HI>Christianly) That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to the Iudgment of the Spirit of Truth in Friends</HI>; but to give an absolute Submission, he could not, to any S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ciety of men what|soever; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>absolute Submission</HI> implyeth <HI>absolute In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">allibility,</HI> that no Society <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> pretendeth unto but the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> and therefore to introd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e it among us, would be <HI>Rank Pope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y</HI>; at which some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gainst <HI>G.

K.</HI> to that effect before he had finished the full Sentence, which we judge was very unfair, as well as unusual.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="000606_0013_0FA95D2290C5F200">But whereas some from this would infer, as if <HI>G. K.</HI> denyed any <HI>positive Power of Iudgment to a true Church, or Meeting of true Christians, met together in the Name of Christ, where he is present in the mindst of them G. K.</HI> gave no ground for any such inference, for he doth rea|dily grant, That a true Christian Assembly hath a positive Power of Judgment, when met together in his Name, and that he is present in the midst of them, and is felt and witnessed to guide them in true Judgment. But we all know, that it is possible at times, that Parti|ality, and Prejudice, and Annimosities may prevail in Meetings, that may pretend to meet in the Name of Christ, and also to have him present in the midst of them, and yet where such things prevail, Christ is not in the midst known to give true Judgment, or to guide men to give it, as Friends Letter to us from <HI>London</HI> expresly declareth. And therefore we judge, That <HI>No absolute Submission</HI> should be required of any Member to the Judgment of that Society he belongeth unto in a matter of Truth or Christian Doctrine, or wherein the Conscience is concerned; for it is time enough to submit to the Judgment of Bre|thren, when a man hath heard it, and has brought it to the Ballance and Test of that which giveth true Judgment in every particular, that is in a qualified Frame to understand it, even as Christ said, <HI>As I hear I judge,</HI> John 5.30.

<P>But if any say, <HI>At last it was yeilded in the Quarterly Meeting, that the Adjourned Meeting in the School-house was a true Meeting, but an Appeal was made from that Monthly Meeting to the Quarterly Meeting, and the Quarterly Meeting offering to give a new Iudgment in the Case, and in order thereto ordered</HI> G K. <HI>to with-draw, he refusing so to do, hindered that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Iudgment could be given.</HI> But to this it was and is answered, That there could be no Appeal from that Monthly Meeting to the Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arterly Meeting, because most of the Quarterly Meeting did con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t of the Friends that gave the Judgment at the Monthly Meeting, and such as were over, were but a few in comparison, except some Country Friends that did not care to meddle in that matter, and so to appeal from the Monthly Meeting to the Quarterly Meeting, was in effect but to appeal from the Monthly Meeting to a small part or Num|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of Persons in the Quarterly Meeting, the most of which, and

the most leading men, were known to be prejudiced against <HI>G. K.</HI> and Parties against him; and <HI>G.

K.</HI> did well not to go forth, so as to submit to the judgment of these men, who had sufficiently shown their Partiality against him, and som of which had unjustly accused him, as can be well proved. Besides, things being duely considered, there was no reason that <HI>G. K.</HI> should have gone forth, either at that Meeting or any other, for <HI>G. K.</HI> was no otherwise concerned in that Difference with <HI>W</HI>&mdash; and <HI>T</HI>&mdash; than all faithful Friends, and the whol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Meeting ought to have been con|cerned, to wit, to defend one of the greatest <HI>Principles of the Christian Faith,</HI> viz. <HI>That the Man Christ Iesus who was crucified, did rise from the Dead, and is now in being,</HI> And <HI>That Faith in him is ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">essary to make men true Christians</HI>; And therefore not <HI>G.

<PB N="15" REF="000606_0015_0FA95D241640A3D8">
given such deep ground of offence, to all of us, with other thing concurring, that because to this day nothing hath been done (it being now above a Year since complaint was made against <HI>W</HI>&mdash;) by these of the other side, who meet in a Seperation from us, either to bring <HI>W</HI>&mdash; or <HI>T</HI>&mdash; to Condemnation, but suffer them to continue to preach and pray in their Meetings; therefore we do justly judge, That the whole Meeting that meet in a Seperation from us, that owneth these men &amp; tollerateth them in their great Errors and Trepasses, are guilty with them, and accountable for their Errors; and therefore according to Christs command recorded in the holy Scripture, we ought to be sepe|rate from them, altho' (as hath been sufficiently proved) they began the Seperation, and they having begun it, we cannot in Conscience unite in Meetings with them here at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> until they give satis|faction to Truth in these weighty things.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second Cause</HI> of the Seperation (which also we lay at their door) is, That whereas in the Monthly Meeting in the first Month last, a Proposition bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g made to change the Meetings, both at the Centre &amp; in the Town, and some being for the said Change, and others against it, and having good Reasons why they were against the said Change, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in the Meeting, contrary to our declared mind and assent, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> over them that dissented, to change the said Meetings; a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we have not known formerly allowed by Friends any where in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onthly meetings, that one Party (suppose equal or greater in Number than the rest) should assume a Power to appoint or change Place<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Times of Meetings without the Consent of their Brethren; for things, of that Nature especially, use always to be done with una|nimous Consent, and not by Plurality of Votes, which is not the way of Truth; and because we were not free to stand to the Arbitrary and Rash Determination, as to that Change, therefore we met at the ordi|nary Meeting-place, as formerly practised, and they began the Sepe|ration, in keeping a Publick Meeting in the after-noon at the Bank, contrary to our declared sense and mind, only some of us met at a pri|vate Family meeting in the Evening, at the House of <HI>G. K.</HI> that could be counted no seperate Meeting for that day. And afterwards, we finding they were resolved to continue in their way of Seperation, and that some had endeavoured to lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k us out from meeting at the Bank in the fore-noon, this put us upon seeking a new place to meet in, in
<PB N="16" REF="000606_0016_0FA95D24CD1ADBC0">
case we had been disappointed of the other; and tho' some of us did declare our sincere intention and sense, that it were good but to have one Publick Meeting on first Days, to end about the second hour, and the remaing part to be used for private Meetings in Families, yet their keeping up their publick After-noons meeting, hath given us just occasion at present to have a Publick After-noons Meeting as well as they, for we hope they shall not have any cause to say against us, that we are short of them in our Zeal for good Meetings.</P>
<P>Things being thus far advanced, and the Seperation being begun, and carried on so far by them, and justly chargeable upon them, some of them having desired us to make some Proposals, or Expedients for healing the Breach, and uniting again as formerly, after some time we s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt some Proposals to them, that we were satisfied in our Consciences were most equal and just, and such as the Truth required of us; but they are so far from being satisfied with most of them, that they have the more blamed us, some insinuating as if we had transgressed the Law, but we are not afraid of any such thing, providing true Liberty of Conscience, according to the just and due bounds of it, be allowed to us; and for our part, we are so well satisfied that all our Proposals to them (in that Paper signed by fifteen of us) are just and equal, that if they please, we shall freely consent to their Printing of them. The sum of which Proposals doth principally consist in these two things, 1st, <HI>That all such of the Ministry among them, whom we can prove guilty of preaching false Doctrine, or of falsly accusing the Innocent, or ex|cusing and defending the Guilty, and contending against some sound Prin|ciples of Truth, in Meetings appointed for hearing these Differences, may be brought to Conviction and Acknowledgment of their Error and Trespasses:</HI> And 2dly, <HI>Seeing (by a marvelous Providence that hath discovered it) that our Monthly Meetings here-away have consisted of a mixt Number of some Believers and some Vnbelievers, or of some men unsound in the Christian Faith, that we agree together to put</HI> Robert Barclay's <HI>Doctrine (well ap|proved of by the best of our Friends in</HI> England, <HI>and particularly by</HI> G.

<P>And now, a <HI>Third</HI> &amp; main <HI>Reason</HI> that we give for this Seperation, well warranted both by Scripture Testimony, and command of Christ recorded in Scripture, and the truth of it sealed to us, by the Spirit of Truth in our hearts, that whereas there are diver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; of <HI>most Gross</HI> and <HI>Vnchristian Errors</HI> against the <HI>Fundamental Doctrine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Christian Faith,</HI> who are publick Preachers among them, and whose Ministry they fit under, and some encourage them, others tollerate and suffer them; and that others even of their Preachers are guilty of other gross Errors, and other Trespasses that render them altogether unqualified for the Ministry, and to uphold or tollerate them is to bring Reproach to Truth and ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> holy Profession, and to the Body of our faithful Friends, with all whom we remain in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ar Unity in all parts of the World, hoping that faith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul Friends and Breth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t have an impar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ial account and information of us, and do rightly and duely consider and examine the Righteousness of our Cause, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> en|courge us therein, to the Disappointment of such who affirm the con|trary, but we being principally supported &amp; encouraged by the Spirit of Truth in our hearts, that as such men immediately guilty of these vile Errors, some of which no <HI>Protestant Christian Society</HI> would tolerate, neither <HI>Episcopal, Presbyterian</HI> nor <HI>Baptist,</HI> are to be turned away and seperated from; so that Society is to be turned away from, whoever they be, that doth uphold or tollerate them, and bring them not to due Conviction and Condemnation, after due and sufficient notice is given unto them, as there hath been for a long time, from one Mee|ting to another, as concerning some of them, now many Months since past, and nothing done effectually to bring them to any Conviction, but that it seemeth they are resolved still to support or tollerate them. Now the Scriptures that warrant us in this Seperation (altho' as is said first made by them) are these following, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.14, 15, 16, 17. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.3, 4, 5. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.2, 3, 4, 5. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.10. <HI>Rev.</HI> 18.4. 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3.6. <HI>Rom.</HI> 16.17. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.14, 15, 20. and the same is expresly confirmed by the Doctrine delivered by <HI>R.

<P>WE have seriously considered, how that of late Years espe|cially many are crept into a bare out-side Form of the Pro|fession of the People of God, called in Scorn <HI>Quakers,</HI> and have assumed or suffered themselves to be called by that Name, and have frequented not only their Publick Meetings, but also their men and womens mea|nings, and have taken upon them to act and be concerned in these mee|tings, and some have presumed to preach and pray therein, that to our certain knowledge, by manifest evidence of Words and Works, are not worthy to be reputed members of a Christian Society or Church of Christ, because of their great Ignorance and Unbelief in the <HI>first Principles of the Doctrine of Christ,</HI> whereof some here-away of late have given sufficient proof, to the great Scandal of our holy Profes|sion, by their plain and express words uttered before divers credible Witnesses, and sometimes by their unsound Doctrines published, and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oss Perversions of Scripture, to the Observation of many who are but of weak understanding, and some of them have been detected of scandalous Conversation, and have not given any convincing Evidence of their true Repentance, and that there hath been too much forbear|ance used by some toward such, for their hardning and emboldning themselves against the Truth and faithful Friends and Brethren, and that by the marvellous Providence of God that hath suffered such things to come to light, some have discovered their woful Ignorance, Unbelief and gross Errors by their late words, without all shame or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and that some others have appeared too manifestly inclined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">loak, excuse and support them, which giveth us too great occasion to suspect them guilty of the same, or the like things; and that things are come to that pass of late, that contrary Testimonies are born in meetings by &mdash;one against another, and yet both pretending to the Spirit of Truth; and great Disputes and Contentions have been of late betwixt&mdash; one against another, before not only many called <HI>Quakers,</HI> but some others that never were of that Profession, &amp; that concerning several Fundamental and Principal Doctrines of the

as well as that their Conversation is such as becometh the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<P N="2"><HI>2</HI>dly. <HI>Concerning the</HI> Church, <HI>he giveth this Definition of it, p. 32.</HI> A Church then in the Scripture-phrase, is no other than a Meeting or Ga|thering of certain People, which (if it be taken in a Religious Sense, as most commonly it is) are gathered together in the Belief of the same Principles, Doctrines and points of Faith, whereby, as a Body, they become distinguish|ed from others, and have a certain relation among themselves, and a conjunct Interest to the maintaining and propogating these Principles they judge to be right, and therefore have a certain Care and Oversight over one another, to prevent and remove all occasions that may tend to break this their conjunct Interest, hinder the Propogation of it, or bring Infamy, Contempt or Con|tumely upon it, or give such as on the other hand are or may be banded toge|ther to undo them, just occasion against them, to decry and defame them. [Note, <HI>This is the present case with us, and therefore to prevent Truth and faithful Friends being defamed by Adversaries, we are weightily concerned in this publick Testimony.] And a little after p. 33. he saith,</HI> The Power and Authority, Order and Government we speak of, is such a Church, Meeting, Gathering or Assembly claims towards those that have or do <HI>Declare</HI> themselves members, who own, believe and profess the same Doctrines and Principles of Faith with us, and go under the same Distinction and Denomination, whose Escapes, Faults and Errors may by our Adversaries justly be imputed to us, if not seasonably and chri|stianly reproved, reclaimed, or condemned, &amp;c. <HI>And p. 34. he saith,</HI> We being a People gathered together by the Power of God, into the Belief of certain Principles and Doctrines, and also certain Practices &amp; Performances, by which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> be seperated and distinguished from others, so as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a part. <HI>And p. 48. he saith,</HI> The Principles, Doctrines and Practices

necessarily depending upon them (viz. <HI>into the Belief of which we were gathered by the Power of God</HI>) are as it were the Terms that have drawn us together, and the Bond by which we became centered into one Body and Fellowship, and distinguished from ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers; and yet this not so the Bond, but <HI>(see his margen)</HI> that we have a more inward and invisible, to wit, the Life of Righteousness, &amp;c. <HI>And p. 49. he saith,</HI> Suppose a People really gathered into the Belief of the true and certain Principles of the Gospel, if any of these People shall arise, and contradict any of those Fundamental Truths, [Note, <HI>That he owneth</HI> Fundamental Truths, <HI>and therefore according to him and sound Friends, there are more than one Funda|mental Truth, altho' Christ the original Truth is but one, yet the Branches are many</HI>] whether has not such as stand good right to cast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a one out from among them, and to pronounce possitively, <HI>This is con|trary to the Truth we profess and own, and therefore ought to be re|jected, and not received, nor yet he that asserts it, as one of us:</HI> And is not this Obligatory upon all the members, seeing all are concerned in the like Care, as to themselves, to hold the right and shut out the wrong? <HI>And p. 52.</HI> If the Apostles of Christ of Old, and the Preachers of the Ever|lasting Gospel in this Day, had told all People, however wrong they found them in their Faith and Principles, <HI>Our Charity and Love is such, we dare not judge you, nor seperate from you, but let us all live in love to|gether, and every one enjoy his own Opinion, and all will be well;</HI> how should the Nations have been, or what way now can they be brought to Truth and Righteousness? Would not the Devil love this Doctrine well, by which Darkness and Ignorance, Error and Confusion might still continue in the Earth, unreproved and uncondemned? <HI>And again, in the same p. 51, 52. he saith,</HI> Were such a Principle to be received or believed, That in the Church of Christ <HI>No man should be seperated from, no man condemn|ed, or excluded the Fellowship and Communion of the Body, for his Judgment or Opinion in matter of Faith,</HI> Then what Blasphemies so Horrid, what Heresies so Damnable, what Doctrines of Devils, but might harbour it self in the Church of Christ? &amp;c. <HI>And p. 78, 79. he saith, (giving some of the Differences betwixt the</HI> Romanists, <HI>and the ge|nerality of these called</HI> Protestants, <HI>on the one hand, and the People called</HI> Quakers <HI>on the other hand</HI>) That whereas those in matters of Dif|ference only allow these of the Clergy, so called, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Ministry, to give a Iudgment, with other select Persons chosen, The People called <HI>Quakers</HI> exclude no member of the Church to give his Iudgment: <HI>And 2dly,</HI> Those

say, The Decision is to pass Conclusive by Plurality of Votes; which, <HI>as he saith,</HI> the <HI>Quakers</HI> do not, but allow that at times the plurality may be wrong, and the few may be right. <HI>And p. 81. he saith,</HI> If so be in such a Church (viz. <HI>as above described</HI>) there should arise any Difference, there will be an Infallible Iudgment from the Spirit of God, which may be in a general Assembly, yet not limited to it, as excluding others, and may prove the Iudgment of the plurality, yet not to be decided thereby, as if the Infallibil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty were placed there, excluding the fewer, in which a Meeting or Assembly upon such an account, there is no Limitation to be of Persons par|ticularly chosen, but that all that in a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ue Sense may be reckon'd of the Church, as being sober and weighty, may be present, and give their Iudgment, &amp;c. <HI>And p. 85. he saith,</HI> This Infallible Iudgment is only and unalterably an|nexed and seated in the Spirit and Power of God, not to any particular Person or Persons, Meeting or Assembly, by virtue of any settled Ordina|tion, Office, Place or Station, that such may have, or have had in the Church; No Man, Men nor Meeting, standing or being invested in any Authority in the Church of Christ, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther Terms, than so long as he or they abide in the living Sense and Vnity of the Life in their own particulars.</P>
