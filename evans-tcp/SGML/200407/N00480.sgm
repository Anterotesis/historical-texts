<HEAD>A few Words of Preface.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> in his Preface, begineth with a gross Falshood, to wit, that it hath been fully proved that <HI>Quakerism</HI> is <HI>Paganism</HI>; for it never yet hath been proved by him, nor any other, nor ever will be, to wit, That the Religion professed by the sincere and faithful People, called in scorn <HI>Quakers,</HI> is either <HI>Paganism,</HI> or any other thing than real <HI>Christianity;</HI> although there may be some that may be called <HI>Quakers,</HI> but are not owned by us to be our faithful Brethren, even as they are not all true <HI>Christians,</HI> who are so called, nor were they all <HI>Israel</HI> who were called <HI>Israel</HI>; The <HI>Reader</HI> may expect what full store of Lyes he may be entertained with by <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> when the first two Lines of his Preface are such a notorious Lye.</P>
<P>And as for the Etymology of the Name <HI>Christian,</HI> which, as he alledgeth, one that appears lately in Print, as an Advocate of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> giveth as if <HI>Christianoi</HI> were <HI>Christionoi,</HI> that is, Christ's Asses; he should have given us the Name of that Advo|cate, that we might have found how truly he hath cited him. It hath been thought that some of the <HI>Heathens,</HI> by way of Reproach, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">evise such an Etymology of the Name <HI>Christianos,</HI> as if it were <HI>Christionos,</HI> i. e. <HI>Christs Ass;</HI> but I judge not that to be the true Etymology of that Name, but that <HI>Christianos</HI> is as much as to say, A Follower of Christ, or one partaking of that heavenly Anointing, which in all Fullness was poured by the Father on Christ, and is derived in various Measures from Christ&punc; according to the good pleasure of God, unto all that bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eve sincerely in him. But supposing that Etymology, that a <HI>Christian Quaker</HI> is one of Christs Asses, I propose it to the serious Consideration of the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> whether it be not much more honourable and
<PB REF="000605_0003_0FA95D71D3311600">
profitable to be one of Christs Asses, so as to witness a fullfilling that figure of Christs riding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Ass outwardly, as was prophecied of him, than to be the Priests Asses in <HI>New-England</HI> and else-where, to be rid upon by them, as is too manifest they have been. And for his supposed Load he hath imagined he hath laid on us, it toucheth us little, and returneth on himself, and will be his own Burden.</P>
<P>And concerning <HI>Christian Lodowick</HI> his Challenge to the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> it is sufficiently answered, and he declared to be a gross Calumniator.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> in his late <HI>Address</HI> seemeth to lay great weight on the Opinion of <HI>Richard Baxter,</HI> (whom he calleth <HI>Reverend Baxter</HI>) concerning the <HI>Quakers,</HI> I thought fit to Transcribe some few Passages of <HI>Richard Baxter</HI> in a printed Book of his, called, <HI>Directions for weak distempered Christians,</HI> that may be of some service to that injured People, called in scorn <HI>Quakers.</HI> In pag. 142. of that Book, he saith, <HI>From my own Observation, which with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ieved Soul, I have made in this Generation, I hereby give warning to this and all succeeding Ages, that if they have any regard to Truth, or Charity, they take heed how they believe any factious partial Historian, or Divine, in any evil that he saith of the Party that he is against; for (though there be good and credible Persons of most Parties, yet) you shall find that Passion and Partiality prevaileth against Consci|ence, Truth and Charity in most that are sick of this Disease, and that the Envious Zeal which is described,</HI> James 3. <HI>doth make them think they do God Service, first in believing false Reports, and then in venting them against those that their Zeal or Faction doth call the Enemies of Truth.</HI> And a little after he saith, pag. 143. <HI>Most Christian is that Advice of</HI> Dr. Henry Moore, <HI>That all Parties of Christians would mark all the good which is in other Parties, and be more forward to speak of that, than of the Evil: And this</HI> (saith <HI>Baxter) would promote the Work of Charity in the Church, and the interest of Christianity in the World; whereas the overlooking of all that's Good, and aggravating all the Evil (and falsly feigning more th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n is True) is the Work of greatest Service to the Devil, &amp;c.</HI> Now if both <HI>Richard Baxter</HI> and <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> had well practised this Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice, they would not have been so Uncharitable to the People called <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
<P>But seeing <HI>C. M.</HI> la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth so great weight on his Reverend <HI>Baxter,</HI> as he calleth him (though I find not any where that he calleth <HI>Paul, Peter</HI> or <HI>Iohn,</HI> or any of the Prophets or Apostles by such a high desig|nation) even by <HI>Baxte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>'s, own Judgment, neither <HI>G.

<PB N="2" REF="000605_0005_0FA95D72D0AEFF00">
thing generally acknowledged by all <HI>Protestants,</HI> That where any Man or Society of Men, err not in a Fundamental Article of the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> we ought to have Charity towards them, as our Christian Brethren, if in some other things they are under some Mistakes, and that their Conversation and Practice be free of Scandal. And that I may the more effectually make it apparent, how that by the Judgment of <HI>Richard Baxter</HI> neither <HI>G. K.</HI> nor his Brethren who are of his Faith, are guilty of any Fundamental Errors touching the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> I think fit to transcribe (faithfully) a Passage in his fore-cited Book, pag. 84, 85, 86. where he undertaketh to describe the intire Essence of the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> as to the matter of it. <HI>The Foundation Principle</HI> (saith he) <HI>or Fundamental Matter is God the Father, Son and holy Ghost, the secondary Foundation or Fundamental Doctrine, is those Scripture Pro|positions that express our Faith in God the Father, the Son and the holy Ghost: When we name three Persons as the Object of the</HI> Christian Faith, <HI>we express Names of Relation, which contain both the Persons, Nature and Offices, and undertaken Works; without either of which God were not God, and Christ were not Christ, and the holy Ghost were not, in the sence of our Articles of Faith, the holy Ghost; as we must therefore believe, That there is one only God, so we must believe, That God the Father is the first in the holy Trinity of Persons; that the whole Godhead is perfect, and infinite in Being, and Power, and Wisdom, and Goodness, (in which all his Attributes are comprehended, but yet a distinct Vnderstanding of them all, is not of absolute necessity to Salvation;) That this God is the Creator, Preserver, and Disposer of all things, and the Owner and Ruler of Man|kind, most Iust and Merciful, that as he is the beginning of all, so he is the ultimate end, and the chief good of Man, which before all things else must be loved and Sought. Concerning the Son, we must moreover believe, That he is the same God with the Father, the second Person in Trinity, Incarnate, and so became Man, by a Personal Vnion of the Godhead and Manhood</HI> [He omitteth his being conceived of the holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which was needful to have been exprest, it being a great Article of our Christian Faith] <HI>That he was without Original or Actual Sin, having a sinless Nature, and a sinless Life; That he fullfilled all Righteousness, and was put to Death, as a Sacrifice for our sins, and gave himself a Ransom for us; and being buried, he rose again from the dead, and afterward ascended into Heaven, where he is Lord of all, and interceedeth for Believers; That he will come again,
<PB N="3" REF="000605_0006_0FA95D741BB21A68">
and raise the dead, and judge the World, the Righteous to Everlasting Life, and the Wicked to Everlasting Punishment: That this is the only Redeemer, the Way, the Truth and the Life, neither is there access to the Father but by him, nor Salvation in any other. Concerning the Holy Ghost we must believe, That he is the same one God, the third Person in Trinity, sent by the Fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er and the Son to inspire the Prophets and Apostles; and that the Doct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine inspired and miraculously attested by him, is true; that he is the Sanctifier of these that shall be saved, renewing them after the Image of God in Holiness and Righteousness, giving them true Repentance, Faith, Hope, Love, and sincere Obedience, causing them to overcome the Flesh, the World, and the Devil, thus gathering a holy Church on Earth to Christ, who have, by his Blood, the Pardon of all their sins, and shall have Ever|lasting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dness with God: This</HI> (saith <HI>Richard Baxter) is the Essence of the Christian Faith, as to the Matter o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it.</HI></P>
<P>And now, as concerning that judged by <HI>Richard Baxter</HI> the Essence of the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> as to the Matter of it, I declare sincerely, without all Equivocation or mental Reservation, in the true and ge|nuine sence of the Words, that I have transcribed out of his said Treatise, that I know not wherein I or my Brethren, of my Faith and Perswasion differ from him in any one particular, as to the matter of it, or substance therein contained; the only exception we have, is against that unscriptural Term or Phrase of <HI>Three Persons,</HI> or a <HI>Trinity of Persons,</HI> but we own sincerely, That our Faith ought to be, and is in God the Father, the Son and the holy Ghost, and that these Names are Names of Relation, respecting the Relations, as well as the Re|lative Offices, and Works of those Three; and this being granted by us, in the sincerity of our Hearts, we are excused or cleared by <HI>Iohn Calvin,</HI> for whose Memory I suppose <HI>C. Mather</HI> hath as full and great esteem as for <HI>R. Baxter</HI>; for in his first Book of <HI>Institutions,</HI> cap. 13. n. 5. he sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h expresly, <HI>Vtinam quidem sepulta <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> (sc. inventa Nomina</HI> (as he expresly calleth them) <HI>Trium Personarum) constaret modo, hec inter omnes Fides, Patrem, et Filium, et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">piritum esse unum Deum, nec tamen aut Filium esse Patrem, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Spiritum Filium, sed pro|prietate quadam esse distinctos, ne&abque; enim tam precisa sum austeritate ut obnudas voculas digladiari sustineam</HI>; In English thus, <HI>I wish</HI> (saith he) <HI>the invented Names</HI> (viz. <HI>of Three Persons) were buried, providing this Faith were manifest among all, that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is one God; and yet that the Son is not the Father, nor that the Spirit is the
<PB N="4" REF="000605_0007_0FA95D792EDCA4A0">
Son, but that they are distinct by a certain Property</HI> (to wit, in their Relative Attributes, as that the Father did beget the Son, and the Son was begotten of the Father, and that the holy Spirit did proceed from both) <HI>for I am not of such precise Austerity</HI> (said <HI>Calvin) that for bare small Words I would contend</HI>; and withall he confesseth, <HI>That the Orthodox antiently did not agree about these Terms or invented Words,</HI> that he acknowledgeth, <HI>were invented since the Apostles dayes, to guard against the</HI> Arrian, Sabellian, <HI>and other Heresies.</HI> And therefore since we are altogether free of these Heresies, and that we detest them from our very Souls, no sober <HI>Christian</HI> will judge uncharitably of us in that respect. And as for the word <HI>Distinct,</HI> if some of our Friends, taking it to signifie distant or seperated asunder one from another, as in remote and distant places, have refused it, in this and other mat|ters, as indeed sometimes, at least vulgarly it doth so signifie, as when we say, <HI>America</HI> is distinguished from <HI>Europe,</HI> by a great &amp; spacious Sea interveening, they ought not to be accused for so doing, seeing in that other sence of the word <HI>Distinct,</HI> that is more in use among Schollars, as when we say, Things are distinct when the one is not the other, they own a <HI>Distinction,</HI> as that the Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Father, (though he is our Father, and is, expresly call'd in Scripture the <HI>Everlasting Father</HI>) and Christ's Manhood and Body is not the Godhead, and yet one Christ; as the Body of a Man is not his Soul, and yet Body and Soul is one Man; and in this second sence we do allow the word distinct. And as to the Manner of receiving the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> we grant with him, <HI>first,</HI> That it must not only be received, as true, into our Understanding, by a special divine Illumi|nation, that is supernatural, but must be imbraced by the Will, Heart and Affections, as good, yea, exceeding good, and worthy of all ac|ceptation, by a special divine Motion, and working of the holy Spirit, that is supernatural, in &amp; upon the Will, Heart and Affections: 2<HI>dly,</HI> That as touching all the peculiar Mysteries and Doctrines of Faith, the Scriptures have been Instrumental, by and together with the immediate working of the Spirit, to beget in us the true Faith of them: But in this we differ, I suppose, from him, as well as from <HI>C. Mather</HI> and his Brethren of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">-England,</HI> that whereas they hold, <HI>That the Spirit of God worketh in Believers</HI> Effectively, <HI>but not</HI> Obje|ctively, <HI>or by way of sensible Object, or sensibly and perceptibly by its own Self-Evidence and Demonstration to mens Hearts and Souls</HI>; We affirm,
<PB N="5" REF="000605_0008_0FA95D7A30861E80">
That the Spirit of God worketh in Believers, both <HI>Effectively</HI> and also <HI>Objectively,</HI> or by way of sensible Object, or sensibly and per|ceptibly, by its own Evidence and Demonstration to mens Hearts and Souls: And this, divers call'd <HI>Protestants</HI> have acknowledged with us, though denyed by C. M. and his Brethren of <HI>New-England</HI>; but yet I suppose <HI>R. Baxter</HI> will not call this a Fundamental Error in the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> seeing it contradicts none of the Fundamental Articles delivered by him in his said Treatise.</P>
<P>And if any say, or object, <HI>That if the Spirit worketh by way of a sensible Object, upon the inward and spiritual Senses of Believers, this would make void all use of the Scriptures, as being so much as the Instru|ment, or Instrumental to our Faith.</HI> But <HI>I Answer,</HI> denying this Con|sequence, and by distinguishing the Object of our Faith, to wit, that the Scriptures are the Instrumental and secondary Object of our Faith, and the holy Spirit the principal and primary Object of our Faith (as it is sensibly felt to work upon our inward and spiritual Senses) together with the Father and the Son: Even as in outward and natural Objects that work upon our outward and natural Senses, some are principal, and others are instrumental; as in our natural sight of visible Things on Earth, as <HI>Houses, Woods, Trees, Beasts,</HI> the Sun's Light is the prin|cipal Object of our sight, but the things are at least the secondary and instrumental Object thereof; or, as when we read on a Book, the Light that we read with is the principal Object, and the Letters of the Book are the secondary and instrumental; and though we cannot see the Letters of the Book without some light, yet we may see light, yea, the Sun himself, if we have good Eyes, without the Book; and so God, and Christ, and the Spirit may be inwardly seen, felt and known, and is frequently seen, felt, known and enjoyed by the inward and spiritual Senses of Believers, without all present use of Letters or Books, when the Knowledge is Intuitive and Sensible. But as for the Doctrinal Knowledge, as we acknowledge it is requisite, in order to bring us to so high an enjoyment of God and Christ, as <HI>Vision,</HI> or <HI>Intuitive Knowledge,</HI> or <HI>Intuition,</HI> so we grant, it is commonly wrought in us and increased by means of the holy Scriptures, instrumentally working with the holy Spirit, and that therefore the holy Scriptures are of great profit and service to all Ranks and Conditions of People, yea, to such of the highest spiritual Attainments, while remaining in the mortal Body.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000605_0009_0FA95D7A512603C0">I do therefore with, and in behalf of my Friends and Brethren of the same Faith and Perswasion with me, in all parts of the World, make this <HI>Solemn Appeal</HI> to you, the more Sober, Impartial and Judi|cious People in <HI>Boston,</HI> and else-where in <HI>New-England,</HI> to whose Hands this may come, Whether <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> is not extreamly Un|charitable, and possessed with a Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it of Prejudice and envious Zeal, (to use <HI>R.

And notwithstanding of <HI>Cotton Mathers</HI> strong Asseverations against us, as if we denyed <HI>almost all, or most of the Fundamental Articles of the Christian and Protestant Faith,</HI> yet he shall never be able to prove it, That we are guilty of this his so extreamly rash and uncharitable Charge, either as in respect of the Body o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that People, called in scorn <HI>Quakers,</HI> or in respect of any particular Writers or Publishers of our Doctrines and Principles, and Preachers among us, generally owned and approved by us, as men of a sound Judgment and Understanding. And as for his Citations out of the <HI>Quakers</HI> printed Books &amp; Treatises, I would have you to consider, that most of them all are borrowed, and taken not from our own Books, but from our professed Adversa|ries, men known well enough to be possessed with Prejudice against us, such as <HI>Thomas Hicks</HI> and <HI>Iohn Faldo,</HI> and others, whom our Friends in <HI>Old-England,</HI> and particularly <HI>George Whitehead</HI> and <HI>William Penn</HI> have largely answered; yea, I do here solemnly charge <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> to give us but one single instance of any one Fundamental Article of <HI>Christian Faith</HI> denyed by us, as a People, or by any one of our Writers or Preachers, generally owned and approved by us. And if perhaps there be any Citations that <HI>C. M.</HI> cites out of our Books, that he hath read, that seem to confirm his Charge in one or two particulars against us; I do sincerely answer, that I am at a loss to find them in these Books, partly because divers of these Books cited by him, I am altogether a stranger to them, and know not where to find them in all <HI>America,</HI> and partly because he not citing
<PB N="7" REF="000605_0010_0FA95D7B17F81FA8">
the Chapters, Sections, Parts or Pages of them, that may be found here in <HI>America,</HI> I cannot, but with great pains and expence of Time find them out; and I judge I can much better spend my precious time, than in searching of them; and it sufficeth to me, and I hope doth to many others, that according to the best Knowledge I have of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and these most generally owned by them, as Preachers and Publishers of their Faith, of unquestioned esteem among them, and worthy of double Honour, as many such there are, I know none that are guilty of any one of such <HI>Heresies</HI> and <HI>Blasphe|mies,</HI> as he accuseth them. Yet we deny not, but as it hath happen|ed, and doth daily happen to Writers and Preachers belonging to all other Societies, so it may have happened to some among us, to have at times in writing or speaking, delivered things not so warily and cautiously worded, in every respect, as need were: But in this case, all but prejudiced Persons, will say, if it can be found, by comparing their words one with another, that their sence or meaning is found, though not so altogether safely or cautiously worded in every respect, Charity is to be allowed, and the best Construction ought to be given to their words, or they themselves, or their Friends for them, in respect of their absence or decease, who did best know them, ought to be allowed to give their sence of them, as I have done, in the sincerity of my heart, according to my best understanding and know|ledge of them; and I think I should know, and do know these called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and their Principles, far better than <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> or any or all his Brethren, having been conversant with them in publick Meetings, as well as in private Discourses, with the most noted and esteemed among them for about Twenty Eight Years past, and that in may places of the World in <HI>Europe,</HI> and for these divers Years in <HI>America:</HI> And I further say, That i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any things, through inadver|tency, have been said or writ by any of us, and that it can be found so to be, and that a charitable Construction cannot be safely and sin|cerely put upon them, but that they do contradict the holy Scriptures, and the wholsom Doctrine therein delivered by the holy Prophets and Apostles, we do sincerely deny and disown them, and declare our be|ing ready, with all possible sincerity, to disown them, upon due notice and advertisment; for though we affirm, That the Spirit of God in us, and all Believers, in every discovery it gives, is infallible, yet we have never judged our selves absolutely infallible, nor did we ever
<PB N="8" REF="000605_0011_0FA95D7BCF63ED18">
place or fix an absolute Infallibility upon any Man, or Number, or Society of Men since the Apostles dayes; but through Gods mercy we are sensible of our danger of being liable to Mistakes, as well as other men, if we be not duely humble, watchful and careful to keep close and chaste to the pure openings, teachings and leadings of the infallible Spirit of Truth. And we readily grant the great benefit we have by the holy Scriptures, as being instrumental, by and with the immediate working of the Spirit, to preserve us from Error, or if any be overtaken in an Error, and beguiled by the Enemy, to Re|cover and Restore them there-from; therefore it is, that in all respects we prefer the Scriptures, both to our own, and all other Writings; and if any Doctrine or Practice be found contrary thereunto, upon due and impartial Examination, we say, it ought to be disowned and denyed; for the Scriptures of Truth, and the Spirit of Truth that gave them forth, can never contradict the one to the other.</P>

<P>IT cannot, with any colour of Justice, be expected by <HI>Cot.

Ans.</HI> But of this he has not given one true instance: And as to what he alledgeth, that some of us have said, <HI>The Letter is not the Word of God,</HI> to wit, properly and without a figure, he him|self hath said as much, see pag. 59. And that some of us have call'd their Books, <HI>Light risen out of Darkness, Shields of Truth, &amp;c.</HI> they understood it not, but metaphorically or figuratively, by some Me|tonymy, as is common in all Titles of Books, but we have alwayes preferred the Scriptures to our Writings. And that the Scriptures may be call'd the <HI>Word of God,</HI> in a figurative Speech, and also that the True Sense signified in them, is the Word of God, I have acknow|ledged, and so I do still; but that the inward Testimony of God in our Hearts, is more properly and immediately the Word of God, than the outward Testimony of the Scripture, I still affirm, with <HI>Augustine</HI> and other antient Writers.</P>
<P>As for his citing <HI>William Penn's</HI> words agruing against that <HI>same Numerical Body its rising at the Resurrection</HI>; it is clear that he under|standeth the same exact Number of the small Particles or Dusts, nei|ther more nor less than what is commonly buried; and what hurt is there in that? doth not <HI>C. M.</HI> and his Brethren generally say, as well as <HI>W. Penn, That at the Resurrection all shall rise Men, and not Infants, nor lame, nor defective in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y part</HI>; and yet how many Thousands dye Infants, and defective in some Bodily Members?</P>
<P>That some have denyed the <HI>Saints, as such, to be miserable Sinners,</HI> it ought to be considered, that according to the common stile of Scripture, <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Sinners</HI> are distinguished, and the unconverted are called <HI>Sinners</HI>; for the denomination of a thing is taken chiefly from that which is the greatest part; but because in all Saints, even the weake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, Grace and Holiness is the chief and greatest part, therefore from that they receive their Denomination, and are said to be righ|teous

and clean, and not to do Iniquity. That one said, <HI>The Scrip|ture is not the means by which Faith is wrought,</HI> it can receive a candid interpretation, as to say, <HI>the only means,</HI> excluding the inward Grace and Operation of the Spirit; as some say, <HI>Medicine is not the means of a mans Cure,</HI> though a Means, it is understood not the only means.</P>
<P>And whereas he querieth, <HI>If their Primmer hath yet been corrected, wherein they read, False Teachers preach Christ without, and bid People believe in him as he is in Heaven?</HI> If he mean <HI>William Smith</HI>'s Primmer, as I believe he doth, <HI>I Answer,</HI> Yea, it hath been Corrected, in the folio Edition of his other Treatises joyned with it, as is plainly to be seen, thus, <HI>That false Teachers preach Christ only without, but true Teachers preach Christ both without us, and also within us.</HI></P>
<P>And what <HI>William Penn</HI> argueth as concerning <HI>Three Persons,</HI> he only argueth against the invented Names [<HI>Persons</HI>] (as <HI>Calvin</HI> doth acknowledge them, as above-said) which in all proper Language doth signifie Substances, and not meer Properties or relative Attributes, which <HI>W.

<P>As for <HI>Bodily Tremblings,</HI> that they are not so common among these called <HI>Quakers,</HI> as formerly; as good or better Reason can be given, as that these or the like unusual Motions that seized on the Bodies of some <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> about fifty Years ago, are not now so common among them, which the Author of <HI>The fulfilling of the Scrip|tures,</HI> doth plainly acknowledge, was about that time among them; and indeed many of these Tremblings and extraordinary Motions that seized on the Bodies of some <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> &amp; many call'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> in these dayes, did proceed in great part, from the small experience of, and little acquaintance that these Persons had at first with that sensible manner of the working of Gods Spirit, and that there were but few at first that could well advise them to bear with more com|posure and quiet of Body that manner of workings, whereas by more frequent Experience, many did, and do at this day, witness, and feel sensibly, not only as great, but oft greater inward Workings of the Spirit of God, on all accounts, and yet can bear them, and most willingly and gladly submit to them, with little or no Observation,
<PB N="11" REF="000605_0014_0FA95E92D6437680">
of any Bodily Trembling; for as in going to War, and hearing the dreadful Sound of Guns, Trumpets and Drums, the young Souldiers are oft afraid, even to a degree of Bodily Trembling, yet after|wards, having more Experience, they feel not either that Bodily Trembling, nor such fear that is the cause of it; and as Water and Fire at its first breaking forth, is more violent, and yet afterwards is fully as effectual, without such Violence; so at the first hearing of Thunder, and seeing the terrible Flashes of Lightning, Persons are much more afraid, than after, when they are more acquainted with it, by frequency thereof; so it might be, and was so, that the Power and Spirit of God did work in former dayes with a more seeming Force upon many, and yet since doth work as effectually, now, and sometimes more without it, so as not to come under such frequent Observation; and yet even Bodily Tremblings are still wit|nessed, proceeding from the inward working of Gods Spirit, among us; as the Apostle saith, <HI>Knowing the Terrors of the Lord, we perswade men.</HI></P>
<P>Pag. 12. For the words of <HI>Humphry Norton,</HI> alledged by C. M. I have made inquiry at divers, but can find no intelligence of any such words, in any Book of his; but if any such have dropt from him, or any other, tending to deny the Faith of Christ's being in Heaven in his glorified Body of Man without us, we shall be far from excusing them; for we zealously believe, That the Man Christ is in Heaven without us, in his glorified Body of Man, the same for Be|ing he had on Earth, but wonderfully changed in Manner and Con|dition, as is clearly and fully expressed in that late Treatise given forth by our Friends in <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> called, <HI>The Christian Faith, &amp;c.

<P>Pag. 12. And whereas he saith, <HI>If they own those Principles, why won't they give us leave to own them?

<P>Pag. 15. <HI>That the</HI> Quakers <HI>adore</HI> G.

<P>And that he saith, <HI>This</HI> Keith <HI>it is, who has given the greatest ad|vantages to</HI> Quakerism, <HI>and that with no little Alterations</HI>; How this is consistent with his representing me, as if I were <HI>Mad,</HI> pag. 44. <HI>and extreamly Ignorant,</HI> doth not appear. And as for <HI>Alterations,</HI> great or small, that I have made in the <HI>Quakers</HI> Principles, as rightly understood, delivered by our most Antient Friends, of best account in general, he hath not proved. He calleth my late Catechism, <HI>A wily Catechism, wherein</HI> Quakerism <HI>is so disguised, as that one would almost suspect him a real Protestant</HI>; and yet he will needs have it, that the <HI>Iuice of Toads</HI> is as wholsom a Potion: But it is strange that such a <HI>Wily Catechism,</HI> and so <HI>politically contrived</HI> should proceed from a Mad-man, and extreamly Ignorant, as he would have me to be. But however, I say, that Catechism is writ and given forth in true sincerity, without any disguise, and doth as really bespeak me a true <HI>Protestant,</HI> (as all true <HI>Quakers</HI> are) as it doth seem to represent me to be, and will be found to ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e nothing that's hurtful in it, but profitable and wholsom, I hope, upon impartial Examination.</P>

Nor do the <HI>Quakers</HI> say, that men bring with them into the World these inward Illuminations and Convictions, and other Operations of the Light or Spirit, whe|ther common or special, that men feel by experience in them, when at Age, although none can come into the World but as the Almighty Power and Arm of God, who formed them in the&punc; Mothers Womb, doth bring them, and as that eternal Word, without which nothing is made, doth appoint them in their several Ages and Generations. And for <HI>Christian Lodowicks</HI> Challenge against our Friends in <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> it is already answered, and they are cleared from his Calum|nies, and our <HI>Christian Religion</HI> sufficiently distinguished from either <HI>Paganism, Iudaism</HI> or <HI>Mahumatism.</HI> And the Exceptions he makes against my Catechism are soon answered, if his Perversions were but detected. 1<HI>st, That some who are left without either the help of the holy Scriptures, or holy Men, do yet so rightly improve the inward help of Christs Light, as to be accepted with God</HI>; This he saith is altogether contrary to <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.21, 22. But in this, as mostly every where, he perverteth my words and sense; for he hath left out my following words, [<HI>according to the present state</HI>] And what I mean by them I show a little after, <HI>That such who have a measure of sincerity in their Gentile state, but having no Faith in Christ crucified, are but Servants, and not Sons of the free Woman, but are under the Law,</HI> and though accepted so far as sincere in the Servants state, as I proved from <HI>Acts</HI> 10.1, 2, 34, 35. yet not thereby justified as Sons; for I have acknow|ledged, <HI>that without the Faith of Christ crucified and raised again</HI> with|out us, none are or can be so justified (yet they are as the Kings Pri|soners, and as the Man-slayer was in the City of Refuge under the Law, till he heard of the Death of the High-Priest) <HI>and such are shut up under the Safeguard of the Law,</HI> (as <HI>Beza</HI> translates it) <HI>unto the Faith that is afterwards to be revealed,</HI> Gal. 3.23. So there is a place of Re|fuge, although C. M. know it not. Nor doth <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.21, 22. con|tradict it, for that place speaketh not of all <HI>Gentiles,</HI> but these of the worst of them. 2<HI>dly, That some may be saved without outward hearing or preaching,</HI> is granted by the <HI>Westminster Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ession,</HI> in the case of <HI>Infants,</HI> and <HI>Deaf</HI> and <HI>Dumb Persons</HI>; and therefore how devout and Con|scientious <HI>Gentiles</HI> can be saved, hath not the least shadow of greater difficulty to understand: And that none are eternally saved without the <HI>Faith of Christ,</HI> I have granted in my Catechism, and other Trea|tises,

and do still grant, see <HI>Sect.</HI> 4. <HI>Quest.</HI> 10. but how this Faith is wrought in such, is best to leave it until God be pleased further to open it, seeing, as the <HI>Westminster Confession</HI> saith, <HI>God worketh by his Spirit when, where and how he pleaseth</HI>; and as Christ said, <HI>The Spirit bloweth where it listeth,</HI> the <HI>greek</HI> word can well be translated Spirit, and is so by some Translators. 3<HI>dly, That the Principle of the New-Covenant is in all Men,</HI> is not contradicted by <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2.12. but is con|firmed by <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.8, 9, 10. compared with <HI>Deut.</HI> 30.14. and Christs Parable of the Seed sown in four grounds. And why may not the Seed of the New Covenant lie in the hearts of unregenerate Men for a Season, as the Seed of Wheat may lie not having root in the cold dry ground for a Season, till it be moistened &amp; warmed with the Showers &amp; Sun's warmth in the Spring. 4<HI>thly, That having more Wives than one was unlawful under the Law,</HI> is not contrary to <HI>Mat.</HI> 19.45, 48. for altho' Man had but one wife given him at the beginning, yet the Law that permitted such a thing to men, as the like in the case of Divorce came in afterwards. And it is absurd to think that <HI>Abraham</HI> sinned against the Law in his Conscience, writ in his very Nature (and therefore commonly call'd the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> in having two Wives at once; for all sins against the Law of Nature are hainous sins, and of great aggravation, as the <HI>Westminster Confession</HI> acknowledgeth. But see|ing no such sin is charged on <HI>Abraham,</HI> and that he was in great fa|vour with God at that very time, it cannot be said to be against that Law writ in his Nature, though it be against the Law of the New-Covenant now under the Gospel. 5<HI>thly, That we are to wait in Silence for some aid and assistance of the Spirit, to help us to pray,</HI> doth not con|tradict <HI>Acts</HI> 8.22. for as <HI>Peter</HI> commanded <HI>Simon Magus</HI> to pray, so he bid him Repent and Pray; and that he had not the Spirit, was his own fault, as it is the fault of all others (who have it not to assist them, both to wait and pray also) Nor doth mens want of the Spirit, because they depart from it, and resist the gentle Motions thereof, excuse their neglect of Prayer, no more than a mans want of Money excuseth him to pay a just Debt, yet he must not go to pay his debt with false Coyn, no more should a man pray with a Hypocritical Spirit. Nor, 6<HI>thly,</HI> doth <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.28. prove that Repentance, as well as Faith, is not a necessary Condition and Instrument of our Justification; for true Gospel Repentance is not the Work of the Law, but of Faith; and his Reverend <HI>R.

<HI>Quakers</HI> against him, <HI>That Faith and sincere Obedience are necessary Conditions and Instruments of Iustification, and to teach so, he doth not think Popish,</HI> as doth sufficiently appear by what he hath printed on that subject; see his <HI>Aphorisms of Iustification,</HI> pag. 80. where he saith, <HI>Some Ignorant Wretches gnash their Teeth at this very Doctrine, as if it were flat Popery,</HI> viz. <HI>That Men are justified by Faith, as it is an inward Obedience.</HI> Nor 7<HI>thly,</HI> doth <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.11. prove that <HI>Esau</HI> was a Reprobate before he was born, or at any time afterwards; yea, <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> with his <HI>Boston</HI> Brethren, in their former Book, dare not affirm, That <HI>Esau</HI> was a Reprobate, and that men are not born Reprobates, (though some are preferred to others before they are born) but become Reprobates after they have nothing good left in them, is clear from Scripture, that calleth reprobate men <HI>Dross,</HI> after the precious Mettle is extracted from it, and <HI>Chaff</HI> that hath no grain of Wheat in it. Nor 8<HI>thly,</HI> doth <HI>Acts</HI> 8.38. prove that <HI>Christs Bap|tism is with Water</HI>; for as the Practice of Circumcision, after Christs Resurrection, doth not prove it a Gospel-Precept, no more doth the practise of Water Baptism, but both Christ and <HI>Iohn</HI> did teach, <HI>That Christs Baptism was with Fire and the holy Ghost</HI>; but no where is it said, that Christ baptizeth with Water. Nor 9<HI>thly,</HI> doth 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.26. prove, That Believers may not feed upon Christ by Faith, and so sup with him, and he with them, as well when they eat not, as when they do eat together outwardly, remembring the Lords Death, with Solemn Prayer and Thanks-giving, which we grant is good frequently to be done.</P>
<P>And thus I have fully answer'd all his frivolous and weak Objections against my Catechism; so that he hath not discovered the least grain of Error in it; nor doth any thing that I have said in my other printed Treatises contradict the Doctrine of my Catechism, as he doth falsly alledge, perverting my words, in most things, to a sence contrary to my mind, or to what they can bear, so far is he from that Candor of giving them a favourable Construction. But I intend not to follow him in his manifold Impertinences, to weary either my Reader or my self, and shall come to give a brief and plain Answer to his <HI>Five Arguments,</HI> whereby he would perswade the People in <HI>New-England</HI> to turn away from hearing me; the which Arguments savour more of bitter Prejudice and extream Folly and Rashness, than of any Wit or Judgment, and hath nothing of Truth in them, and

M.</HI> and his Brethren, all inward objective immediate Testimony and Revelation of the Spirit. And whereas the Confession mentioneth the inward Work of the holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word (<HI>viz.</HI> the Scripture) in our Hearts. This doth sufficiently prove, That their Confession
<PB N="17" REF="000605_0020_0FA95E974BF26920">
doth not mean or intend any inward Testimony of the Spirit, really and properly so called, as having a standing Evidence of its own, but only borrowed from the Scripture, and therefore is no true and pro|per Evidence at all, but only and altogether improper, yea, as im|proper as if I should say, when I hear but one man give Evidence to the Truth of a thing, and that I read it also in writ from his hand, that three Evidences or Witnesses have given their Evidence to that Truth, as 1<HI>st,</HI> the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 2<HI>dly,</HI> my Ear that heard him, 3<HI>dly,</HI> my Eye that hath read his writ: But what sober Man will say, these are three Witnesses or Evidences?

M. is detected, and G. K. is cleared from being no wise guilty of any Lye in the case. And what I said of <HI>Iohn Owen</HI> is true, for the Title and design of his Book is concerning <HI>The Self-Evidencing Authority of the holy Scriptures,</HI> only he confesseth the Spirits inward Work is necessary to let men see or know it; but that is no proper Witness, more than a mans hearing is one Witness, and the thing heard is another. I do therefore Appeal to all sober, impartial and judicious Readers, Whether not I, but <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> be not convicted of gross Lying or Falshood, and whether the Society he belongs unto, ought not to bring him to Repentance for such Crimes, to use some of his own wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds.</P>

And though it seem a strange and new Doctrine to C. M. and his Brethren, to distinguish betwixt the Scripture, called by some the external or outward Word, and the inward living Word of God that proceedeth from the Mouth of God immediately, as every mans word that proceedeth from his Mouth, and goeth into the Ears of the Hearers, is his immediate Word; yet not only antient Wri|ters and Fathers, so called, did so distinguish, but even these called the Reformed, who began the Reformation from gross <HI>Propery.</HI> And for the antient Writers I shall give but one, (though I could give divers besides) to wit, <HI>Augustine,</HI> of great esteem and fame with <HI>Protestants,</HI> and particularly with <HI>Calvin,</HI> whose Authority he more useth in his <HI>Institutions,</HI> than any of all the Antients: In his 5th Book <HI>de Trinitate, cap.</HI> 11. <HI>Augustine</HI> saith expresly, <HI>Proinde Verbum quod foras sonat, signum est verbi, quod intus luc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, cuj magis verbi competi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> vomen, nam illud quod profertur caruis ore vux verbi est verbum&abque; et ipsum

<P>ANd thus having sufficiently answered what was needful, to the First Part of his <HI>Address,</HI> which is the largest, I shall answer some things, but very briefly to his latter part, partly because almost the whole of it is answered in my former printed Books, directed to the People in <HI>New-England,</HI> and partly because very much of it is answered in the fore-going Sheets.</P>
<P>In the latter part of his <HI>Address,</HI> he hath greatly changed the matter of Debate betwixt us, in most things wrongly stating things, and calling things our Principles which are not; whereas he should have kept to the <HI>Twelve Article</HI>&punc; I charged them with, eleven of which they did fairly own, and the Twelfth I have sufficiently proved to be|long to them, as much as the eleven; and he should have given an Answer to my former Book, called, <HI>The pretended Antidote proved Poyson,</HI> which he hath not so much as essayed, but instead thereof he goeth to change the matter of Debate betwixt us, in the things I had charged them with in most particulars, and by most g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oss Perversions of our Friends words, would fix on them Principles which they do no wise hold. And in this <HI>New <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssay,</HI> he sets down <HI>Sixteen Assertions,</HI> wherein he pretendeth to contradict our Principles; but in most of them he doth prevaricate, and goeth from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> state of the Question,
<PB N="43" REF="000605_0046_0FA95EB0D8E8A1F8">
as in the <HI>First,</HI> where he granteth, <HI>That he doth not mean, that the Paper or Letter of the Scripture, but the heavenly Matter of it, is the Word of God</HI>; and thus he doth not contradict us, for I have told him and his Brethren more than once, <HI>Thas we readily grant, the heavenly Matter, and true divine Sence of the holy Scripture, is the Word of God:</HI> But the true state of the Controversie is, <HI>Whether the Scripture is either principally or only the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of God,</HI> excluding any inward Word or Voice of God in mens hearts; we say, there is an <HI>Inward Word</HI> and Voice of God in mens hearts, which, as it doth not contradict the Scripture, but agreeth with it, so it is another thing, and is of the greatest Efficacy, and giveth or sealeth to us, the assurance, that the Scrip|tures are of God, and divinely inspired. In his 2<HI>d Assertion,</HI> he doth no less prevaricate, and mis-state the Controversie; for I did grant in both my former Books, <HI>That there were Extraordinary and Ordinary Revelations and Inspirations given to the Prophets and Apostles of our Lord, and that we did not say, that we or others had these Ext<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aordinary, but the Ordinary, that were common to them with all Saints</HI>; the which ordinary are nevertheless true divine Inspirations and Revelations. And as to what I said out of some antient Writers, tending to open the Di|stinction of Extraordinary and Ordinary Revelations, the extraordi|nary being of a more high and sublime Nature, as proceeding from a more high and excellent measure of the divine Light or Spirit, that is well warranted in holy Scripture, and well approved by Christian Writers of great esteem for Piety and Learning, that he and his Brethren call <HI>Rabbinical Fopperies,</HI> in that they show their great Igno|rance in good Learning; for it is generally acknowledged by <HI>Chri|stians,</HI> as well as <HI>Iews,</HI> yea, and by <HI>Protestants</HI> of good Note, <HI>That the</HI> Hebrew <HI>Names of God, mentioned in Scripture, being various, some of them are greater than others</HI>; and the greater Names do answer to the greater Measures of the divi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Light, and that Name commonly pro|nounced <HI>Iehovah</HI> (which the most learned in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language among <HI>Christians</HI> do confess, they know not how to pronounce, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> consisting of quiescent Letters, and having no proper Vowels of its own, as is acknowledged by the most learned, and as <HI>Buxtorf</HI> in his <HI>Hebrew Lexicon</HI> saith, the first that presumed to pronounce it, was <HI>Petrus Galatinus,</HI> none o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI> Fathers, so called, did presu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to pronounce it or read it, for there is no Tract of it in any of their Writings, though divers of them were well skilled in the

<HI>Hebrew Language</HI>) is generally acknowledged to be one of the greatest Names of God, by which God made himself known to <HI>Moses, Exod.</HI> 6.3. but not to <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Iacob</HI>; and though it be granted, that the Letters of that Name are recorded by <HI>Moses</HI> in many places of <HI>Genesis,</HI> and is to be found in <HI>Hebrew, Gen.</HI> 2.4. and that possibly and very probably <HI>Abraham</HI> might have known the outward Letters or Sound of that Name, yet that doth not infer, that either <HI>Abraham</HI> or any of these Fathers knew the inward force and efficacy signified by that Name, and that so high Revelation belonging to it, that <HI>Moses</HI> did know; for that would contradict <HI>Exod.</HI> 6.3. And though I do no wise approve <HI>Rabbinical Fopperies,</HI> or <HI>Iewish Fictions</HI> or <HI>Fables,</HI> yet what I find either in <HI>Iewish</HI> or <HI>Gentile VVriters,</HI> that doth we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l accord with the divine Oracles of the holy Scripture, I do well receive it and relish it. In his 3<HI>d Assertion,</HI> he doth no less mis-state the Question; for we deny not, but affirm, That the will of God expressed in the Scrip|ture, is a perfect Rule for the <HI>Belief and Practice of every Christian,</HI> as to all <HI>Doctrinals</HI> and <HI>Practicals</HI> of Religion in general; but we say, it is not the <HI>only Rule</HI> nor the <HI>principal</HI>; for the Will of God and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is writ in the fleshly Tables of the Hearts of all the faithful, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> writ, is greater, and of greater vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tue and efficacy than to have it writ in Paper; and though no new Doctrinals or Morals are to be revealed to us, but what a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e sufficiently declared in the Scriptures, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that doth no hinder, but that particular Calls, to Places, Persons and Nations, and particular Prophesies or Predictions of things to come, may be newly revealed, as is granted by divers <HI>Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ants,</HI> and by <HI>Fox</HI> in his Book of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> yea, even <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI> doth acknowledge, <HI>That even in his Time God did raise up extraordinary Officers to restore the Church, if not Apostles, yet at least Evangelists, lib.</HI> 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; <HI>cap.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>n.</HI> 4.

Nor do we say, That the Light doth reveal in every man all that we must know, in order to Salvation, upon its first appearance, or in its first Ministration; for we distinguish betwixt the various inward Ministrations of the Light and Spirit, and teach, <HI>That the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ormer makes way for the latter, as it is well improved</HI>; and as he that goeth up a Stair or Ladder, must begin at the lowest Step or Round, and so by degrees, and in process of time, getteth up higher, untill he come to the place where he would be; and as the sojourning of the People of <HI>Israel</HI> in the Wilderness, had its several Removes, which were Typical, of the Souls inward progress, from spiritual <HI>Aegypt</HI> to the spiritual <HI>Canaan,</HI> so the Souls of men have their several inward and spiritual Sojournings from one degree to another, until they receive the end of their Faith, which is the Salvation of their Souls, as it is written in the <HI>Psalms, They go from strength to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ength, &amp;c.</HI> And it is a great Perversion in <HI>C. Mather,</HI> that because I
<PB N="46" REF="000605_0049_0FA95EB3130BEE48">
blame them for denying, <HI>That there is any Light in men generally, that is sufficient to enable them to do any Work acceptable to God,</HI> as if therefore I did hold, <HI>That every man hath so much Grace &amp; Illumination, as doth enable him to do any</HI> (i. e. whatsoever) <HI>Work acceptable to God:</HI> For, <HI>All men Not to be able to do any work acceptable to God,</HI> And <HI>All men To be able to do any or every VVork acceptable to God,</HI> are not Contradictory, as being both U|niversal; and therefore they are both false; and as two Universals are not Contradictory, and are both false, so two Particulars are not Contradictory, when the one is Positive and the other Negative, and therefore may be both True; As it is true, <HI>That some men are good,</HI> and <HI>That some men are not good</HI>; so it is true, <HI>That some good Works may be done by some men,</HI> and yet it is as true, <HI>That they cannot at that time do some other good VVorks</HI>; for it is a good Work to believe in Christ crucified and raised again, and to love him as such; and yet we do not say, that the Light in every man doth either teach or enable every man at first so to do, for that cannot be done without some special Revelation or Illumination; but yet that more common and general Illumination, where it is well and duely improved, doth enable men to do some other good things, that prepareth the Souls of men to receive that more special Illumination that cometh from the same Author and Fountain, and so is Introductory to that more special; for the Law is Introductory to the Gospel (and yet hath the Gospel hid in it, as in a Seed) as one Natural Science is introductory to another, as the Science of natural Physick is introductory to the Science of Me|dicine, and common Arithmetick is introductory to the more abstruse and recondite parts of Mathematical Learning; for the Operation of the Law inwardly doth so convince the Soul of sin, and doth so dis|cover to the Soul its weakness and shortness in Obedience, notwith|standing of some things that it doth, which are good, after a sort, that it maketh the Soul sick, and so to need the Physiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h is Christ, even crucified and raised again, as the Mystery of him is in|wardly revealed and applyed to the Soul by the Spirit. In his 5<HI>th Assertion,</HI> he doth also grosly prevaricate, and pervert the state of the Question; for we do not say, That Christ is so in the Wicked or Unconverted as he is in the Saints, but after a far other manner; for he is in the Saints by <HI>Vnion</HI> and <HI>Communion</HI> with them, and giveth great and glorious Manifestations of his Glory; whereas in ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, he is not in them by any Union or Communion, yet he is so in them, as to
<PB N="47" REF="000605_0050_0FA95EB3EC51FA50">
operate in them, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eveal and discover some things in them, that are suitable to their present state, in order to their Conversion: Nor do we say, <HI>That Christ is personally in the Saints,</HI> as some imagine.</P>
<P>And as to his Question, <HI>How we shall know Light within from Thought within? I Answer</HI>; If he mean by Thought within, a good Thought or Thoughts, they are distinguished as the cause and effect; for the divine Light within is the cause of every good Thought and Desire, as of every good Word and Work; but all evil Thoughts proceed not from the Light, but from the Darkness; and the Light within doth as plainly distinguish betwixt good and bad Thoughts, and other Motions, as the outward Light of the Sun helpeth us to distinguish betwixt things white and black, or straight and crooked; but as blind men cannot judge of Colours, so who are greatly blinded with Preju|dice and Unbelief against the Light within, (as C. M. is) can but very little distinguish or know good from evil, except in things notoriou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y gross; nor was it the true Light in <HI>Saul,</HI> that approved him in his Persecution, but pricked him in his Conscience, and witnessed against him, if he had hearkned to it; but as a man in his heat of Passion hearkeneth not to true Reason, but is Deaf to it, though it be in him; so men being blinded and hardened with sin, doth not give due regard either to true Reason, or the true divine Light, which are both in them notwithstanding; and yet even those men when they become more cool and calm, may, and do hearken to the dictates of both.</P>
<P>And for his other Question, <HI>Whether their Magistrates (viz.</HI> the Quakers) <HI>ever had a Light which directed them to punish a filthy VVoman for exposing her self stark Naked before their Eyes in a publick Assembly, to prove her Attainment of that Innocency which is without shame?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answ.</HI> I remember no such thing that ever I heard tollerated by the <HI>Quakers</HI> Magistrates; for we all judge, that any such Practice doth really deserve corporal Punishment; and I suppose the Passage he mentioneth, was that which happened some time ago, where the Magistrates of that place, (though no <HI>Quakers</HI>) did punish her, as I was informed, with Imprisonment, which the <HI>Quakers</HI> (I believe in general) that heard of it, did judge, was too little, and that she de|served much more.</P>
<P>In his 6<HI>th Assertion,</HI> he doth not fairly state the Question, and upon his unfair stating it, doth seek to fix upon us Blasphemies, and then cryeth out, <HI>Away with such Blasphemies</HI>&punc; as inferring that

M. and his Brethren are too guilty of Blasphemy, that affirm, <HI>That all evil Actions of Men and Devils, come to pass by the Effective Decree of God, that doth infallibly and inevitably determine and move them to the same</HI>; and so say the Ranters, fathering all their wicked Actions upon God And it is a gross Con|tradiction in <HI>C.

<P>In his 7<HI>th Assertion,</HI> he proceedeth in the like gross Perversion, and mis-stating of things; and as to the first part of it, fighteth against his own shadow, and not my Assertion; for I granted, <HI>That God hath chosen all the Heirs of Salvation unto Faith and Holiness, as the means, and unto Eternal Salvation and Glory, as the end, in Christ Iesus, before the Foundation of the World</HI>; and also, I have granted, <HI>That all are not elected,</HI> nor are any elected who perish finally; and yet this doth not infer eternal Reprobation, because <HI>Elected</HI> and <HI>Reprobated</HI> are not Contradictory Terms, as I have formerly declared; and yet he hath not proved that they are; but maketh a noise strongly asserting what he doth not prove.

<P>In his essaying to prove his 16<HI>th Assertion,</HI> he showeth himself extreamly weak, as if because God commanded the <HI>Iews</HI> to keep the <HI>Seventh Day for a Sabbath,</HI> from the beginning of the World, in the fourth Commandment, therefore <HI>he commandeth the Christians in the same fourth Commandment to keep the first Day.</HI> But I need say no more on this Head, but refer him to his much esteemed <HI>Calvin,</HI> for his Re|futation, who in that doth fully agree with us, as generally do all the <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and many in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>In his 17<HI>th Assertion</HI> he is as weak and abusive as in any of the former, That he &amp; his Brethren cannot own true Piety to be essential to a true Minister of Christ, to make a necessary Provision for the everlasting Peace of renewed Souls, which cannot be saved without their Assertion, <HI>viz. That true Piety is not essential to a true Minister, for this would make their Conversion or Peace wholly depend upon Grace in the heart of a Minister.</HI> But this is a most gross Abuse and Pervertion, and a most silly trick or cheat, to palliate or excuse their absurd Do|ctrine, which a Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d may discover; for the Contradictory Assertion, <HI>viz. That true Piety is essential to a true Minister of Christ, doth not make, that the Conversion of the Souls depend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Grace in the Minister,</HI> because many Thousands of Souls have been and are daily converted without any Minister, good or bad, by reading or hearing the holy Scriptures, the holy Spirit aiding and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> therein, and this is generally confessed by all <HI>Protestants.</HI> And if some think <HI>they were converted by means of some Ministers that were afterwards found to be Hypocrites,</HI> all that this can prove i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, not that they are not converted, but that they are in some mistake about the man whom they thought was the Instrumen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of it, and was not. And for my saying, <HI>It is no wonder that</HI> New-England <HI>abounds with such Impious Ministers</HI>; I did argue <HI>ad nominem,</HI> according to your Principle; for, to say, <HI>True Piety is not essential to a true Minister of Christ,</HI> openeth a door to let in a stood of Impious Ministers u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on the People of <HI>New-England</HI>; and it is to be feared&punc; this absurd Principle hath too much open'd a Door unto them: And for all your strict pretended Tryal of men, before they enter into the Ministry, do ye try them concerning their Piety? if nay, then
<PB N="54" REF="000605_0057_0FA95EB9CCD03A48">
ye open a door to them who may be really Impious, if they have but wit enough to be Hypocrites, and only seemingly Pious, if Yea, this contradicts your Doctrine, who say, <HI>ye have no certain way to try whe|ther men be really Pious or not</HI>; for ye reject all pret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce to a discerning of Spirits, whereby to know who are really Pious, and who not; and the Marks given by <HI>Paul,</HI> whereby to try men, before they be owned to be either <HI>Bishops</HI> (i. e. <HI>Overseers,</HI> or <HI>Pastors</HI>) or <HI>Deacons,</HI> were not out-side Marks of Holyness only, that Hypocrites may have, but to be really <HI>sober, just, holy, temperate (Tit.</HI> 1.8.) and where these Virtues are, they do as certainly and infallibly discover themselves in words and works, to the spiritual Discerners, as Spices and precious Oynt|ments or Perfumes, discover their sweet smell and odour to them who have the right use of their natural smelling.</P>
<P>And as to his Question, <HI>How People may know whether we have an Immediate Call to the Ministry?</HI> To this I <HI>Answer</HI>; There must be some spiritual Ability or Gift of Discerning in such, who are able to know such a thing; for it is only the spiritual Man that is able to judge of spiritual things; and whomsoever God calleth to the Ministry by his Power and Spirit inwardly revealed (that is immediate) his Power and Presence, according to his faithful Promise, doth go along with them, so that some that hear them, though not all, are the Seal of their Ministry, and the Blind are made to see, the Deaf to hear, the Lame to walk, the Dumb to speak, and the Dead to live, to wit, spiritually. And as this was <HI>Luther</HI>'s answer to the <HI>Papists,</HI> that asked for some Signs to prove his and his Brethrens Call, who did commonly upbraid them, <HI>That they never so much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ured a Lame Horse</HI>; so it may suffice for our Answer; for whether C. M. believe it or not, we have had the Seal of our Ministry, that many by means of our Testimony have had their inward Eyes opened, and have been turned from Dark|ness to Light, and from the Power of Sathan unto God; and this in|ward Change hath had its evident Effects of <HI>Christian Piety, Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Iustice</HI> in their outward Conversation. But such who were blind|ed and hardned against the Spirit of Truth, did not know Christ nor his Apostles and Ministers, and therefore we cannot expect that such can know us. And this Question of C. M. may be easily retorted upon him, that doth so confidently affirm, <HI>That there are so many Ministers in</HI> New-England, <HI>that have and use all true Piety</HI>; let him tell us, how he or they can prove, that they are really Holy, and that their Holy|ness
<PB N="55" REF="000605_0058_0FA95EBBB02A5280">
is not a meer outside Holiness, that Hypocrites may have? If he say, they may be known by their Fruits, I query again, <HI>By what Fruits?</HI> Are these Fruits only outward words and works, that Hypocrites may have; for there is nothing barely outward but Hypocrites may have? But if by Fruits, he mean, that which hath some inward Virtue and savour of Life and Grace with them, that do infallibly demon|strate themselves to be the Fruits of the Spirit, to such as have a spi|ritual savour and discerning; as this would contradict their Principle, so it maketh for us, to answer his Question.

<P>HIs Apology for using <HI>You</HI> to one, and saluting with the Hat, is very weak and silly, viz. <HI>Because to say you to a single Person, be|came a Custom when the Common Wealth of</HI> Rome <HI>was turned into a King|dom, first to treat Persons of Quality in the plural Number with</HI> You, <HI>and so by degrees, its descended unto all particular men:</HI> But if Custom be a sufficient Reason to justifie a Practice, then all the Superstitions and vain Inventions of <HI>Heathens</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI> may be allowed; but the Scripture saith, <HI>The Customs of the People are vain, Ier.</HI> 10.3.

And for his asking Scripture, for some of us saying, <HI>Thou writes, Thou hears, so joyning a Nominative Case of the Second Person to a Verb of the Third:</HI> It is easily answered; It is not so much the Incongruity with a Grammer Rule, that we find fault, in using <HI>You</HI> to one, as the vain respect of Persons, and the gratifying a proud Spirit, and bowing to it, who will not be pleased with <HI>Thou,</HI> altho' they give it to God in Prayer, and to some Niger or other that they despise; also, to say <HI>You</HI> to one, when there is more in company, maketh Confusion in the sence, and renders it oft uncertain, whether one or more are intended; but to say, <HI>Thou writes,</HI> hath no such incon|veniency, nor argueth no vain Respect of Persons.

Add to this, that if there be in Infants naturally an evil Principle, a Proclivity to sin, an Ignorance and Pravity of Mind, a Disorder of Affections (as Experience teacheth us there is, and the perpe|tual Doctrine of the Church, and the universal Mischiefs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssuing from Man|kind, and the sin of every man does witness too much) why cannot Infants have a good Principle in them, though it works not till its own season, as well as an evil Principle? If there were not by Nature some evil Principle, it is not possible that all the World should chuse sin: In free Agents it was never heard, that all Individuals loved &amp; chose the same thing, to which they were not naturally inclined; neither do all men chuse to Marry, neither do all chuse to abstain; and in this Instance, there is a natural Inclination to one part; but of all the men and women in the World, there is no one t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at hath never sinned; <HI>If we say, we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the Truth is not in us,</HI> said an Apostle: If the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">efore Nature hath in Infants an evil Principle, which operates when the Child can chuse, but is all the while within the Soul, either Infants have by Grace a Principle put into them, or else sin abounds where Grace does not super-abound, expresly against the Doctrine of the Apostle.

<P>Ioan Norris, <HI>M. A. and late Fellow of</HI> All Souls <HI>Colledge in</HI> Oxford, <HI>in his Treatise,</HI> Reflections upon the Conduct of Humane Life, Reflect. <HI>2.</HI> N. <HI>9.</HI> pag. <HI>69. saith,</HI>
<Q>The Right and only Method of Inquiry after that Truth which is Perfective of the Understanding, is to consult the divine <HI>Logos,</HI> or Ideal World; for this is the Region of Truth, and here are <HI>hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge:</HI> This is that great &amp; universal Oracle lodged in every mans Breast, whereof the Antient <HI>Vrim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> was an expressive Type or Emblem. This is &dagger; <HI>Reason,</HI> this is <HI>Conscience,</HI> this is <HI>Truth,</HI> this is that <HI>Light with|in</HI> so darkly talk't of by some, who have, by their aukward, untoward and unprincipled way of representing it, discredited one of the Noblest Theorys in the World:</Q>
[<HI>Note,</HI> If perhaps some have been shore in that thing, yet it hath been well demonstrated by many or most of that People here by him reprehended.]
<Q>But the thing in it self, rightly understood, is true; and if any shall call it <HI>Quakerism</HI> or <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> I shall only make this Reply at present, That 'tis such <HI>Quakerism</HI> as makes a good part of <HI>St Iohn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Gospel,</HI> and of <HI>St Austin's Works.</HI> But to return; This, I say, is that <HI>divine Oracle</HI> which we all may, and must consult, if we would inrich our Minds with Truth, that Truth which is Perfective of the Understanding: And this is the true Me|thod of being truly wise; and this is no other Method than what is advised us by this <HI>divine Logos,</HI> the substantial Wisdom of God; <HI>Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my Gates, waiting at the Posts of my Doors,</HI> Prov. 8.34. And again, says the same substan|tial Wisdom, <HI>Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither.</HI> And again, <HI>I am the Light of the World, he that follows me</HI> (or as the word more pro|perly signifies, <HI>he that consorts,</HI> or <HI>keeps company with me) walketh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in Darkness</HI>&punc; This therefore is <HI>via Intelligentiae,</HI> the way and method of true Knowledge, to apply our selves to the <HI>divine Logo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> to con|sult the <HI>Ideal World.</HI></Q>
