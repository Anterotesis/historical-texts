<HEAD>REMARKS Upon a DISCOURSE Intituled An OVERTURE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In a LETTER to the <HI>Author.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE Glory of <HI>God,</HI> and Interest of Religion, having been the Motives of your publishing your Reasons for a <HI>Subscription</HI> to the <HI>Westminster Confession, &amp;c.</HI> You cannot be displeased with me, if from the same Motives, I offer some Objections against the proposed <HI>Subscription,</HI> and your Arguments to perswade it.</P>
<P>I have nothing to object against your appear|ing publickly in this Case: For, if <HI>Subscription</HI> be a Duty, and the Cause you espouse be the Cause of God, (as you seem very confident that it is) it must be a commendable Zeal, that prompts you to be extensively useful and ser|viceable, in such an important Affair. I shall therefore make no Remarks upon your <HI>Apology,</HI> for the Publication of the <HI>Overture</HI> and <HI>Preface</HI>:
<PB N="4" REF="003156_0003_0FF081A387BE50A8">
But immediately enter upon the Merits of the Cause, and consider,</P>
<P>Whether it is the Duty of our <HI>Synod, pub|lickly and Authoritatively to adopt the Westmin|ster Confession of Faith and Catechisms,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and to oblige their Members, and every Candidate for the Ministry within their Bounds, to sub|scribe them?</HI> This you hold in the Affirmative, and have endeavoured to prove. But either you have wanted Success in that Attempt, or I am so unhappy as not to see the Force of your Arguments.</P>
<P>I shall therefore, with all that Candour and Respect that is due to you, as a <HI>Christian</HI> and a <HI>Minister</HI> of the Gospel, offer you the Reasons of my Dissent from your Proposal, by first taking some Notice of the Arguments for estab|lishing your Opinion, both in the <HI>Overture</HI> and <HI>Preface,</HI> then, by stating my own Objections, and occasionally considering what occurs in your Discourse, to obviate them.</P>
<P>The Argument that claims my first Notice, is in the first and second Pages of the <HI>Overture,</HI> which may be thus summed up.</P>
<P>That <HI>it's the unquestionable Duty of every Christian, according to his Station, especialy of every Gospel Minister, and not of them only; but of every Gospel Church as an Organized Bo|dy politic, to maintain and defend the Truths of the Gospel against all Opposition; and also to endeavour to perpetuate and propagate them unto Posterity, pure and uncorrupt.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003156_0003_0FF081A387BE50A8">But what Consequence would you draw from hence? Is the debated <HI>Subscription</HI> therefore necessary; because it's the only, or the most probable Means to answer these Ends? This I think must be your Meaning, or else your Ar|gument is inconclusive. But then,</P>
<P N="1">1. It's the unquestionable Duty of <HI>every Chris|tian according to his Station,</HI> to subscribe the Westminster Confession, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For <HI>it is their unquestionable Duty</HI> (as you observe) <HI>to maintain and defend the Truths of the Gospel against all Opposition.</HI> And consequently their unquestio|nable Duty, to submit to, and comply with, the necessary Means to that End. You should therefore move for on <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Synod,</HI> that all the Ministers within our Bounds, enjoin a <HI>Subscrip|tion</HI> upon every Member of their respective Congregations; and that too upon Pain of Ex|clusion from their sacred Fellowship. A just Penalty for an open Defyance to <HI>unquestionable Duty.</HI> For, (to use your own Words, p. 21.) <HI>it's utterly impracticable for those of subscribing Principles, to take the Measures which these Principles oblige them unto, in order to their Defence against the Dangers of encroaching Er|rors; and at the same Time to drop this Over|ture; by way of Compliance with those</HI> (Members of their Congregation) <HI>of non-subscribing Prin|ceples.</HI> It's true this Method would put our Congregations into utmost Confusion, it would (to use your own Words) <HI>procure Rents and Di|visions in our small In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ant Church; and be of
<PB N="6" REF="003156_0004_0FF081A5D636B4E0">
most pernicious and dangerous Consequence, con|trary to Christian Charity; and most obstructive to spiritual Edification.</HI> This indeed at first view, seems a formidable Objection. But you have taught me how to answer it. You <HI>appre|hend</HI> (you tell us p. 12.) <HI>that this is in it self a proper Preventive and Antidote against Division, being a suitable Mean to bring a Church to be of one Mind, and one Iudgement; and if it should in the Event have other Effects, it is only by Ac|cident,</HI> &amp;c. And again. <HI>If it be a Churches Duty as a Church</HI> (in which Sence surely it in|cludes the <HI>Congregations</HI> as well as the <HI>Mini|sters) to declare unto the World, and unto one a|nother, the Principles of their Faith,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>it's not the Fear or Danger of Division, that should deter from it.</HI> Thus Sir, if your Conclusion will follow from these Premises, the Conse|quence is unavoidable, that it's our Duty to maintain and defend the Truths of the Gospel, by Schisms, Contentions and Confusions; and even the total Subversion of our Congregations.</P>
<P N="2">2. If this Argument prove any thing to the Purpose, it must also be a necessary Conse|quence, that those Churches that want this De|fence, and enjoin no <HI>Subscription</HI> upon their Ministers, have no good and proper Means to maintain and defend the Truths of the Gospel, and propagate them to Posterity: But Nothing can be more contrary to Truth and Experience, than this Suppositi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003156_0004_0FF081A5D636B4E0" MS="y">I believe it will prove a difficult Task, to find so much as a Proposal, much less an In|junction of <HI>Subscription,</HI> to any Formula what|soever in the primitive Church, before <HI>Constan|tine</HI> the Great. They then found other Means to detect Heresies, to resist Gainsayers, to pro|pagate the Truth; and to keep the Church not only a <HI>Garden enclosed,</HI> but a Garden of Peace. The <HI>Synod</HI> of <HI>Nice</HI> did indeed impose <HI>Subscrip|tions</HI>; but what was the Consequence, but hor|rible Schisms, Convulsions and Confusions, un|til the Church was crumbled into Parts and Par|ties, each uncharitably anathematizing one a|nother. Never was the Church infested with such a Swarm of <HI>Hereticks</HI> and <HI>Heresies,</HI> as sprung from that corrupt Fountain of Imposi|tion and <HI>Subscription.</HI> The <HI>Arrians</HI> were not only strengthened in their Heresy, and encreas|ed in their Numbers by their Persecution; but there was quickly added to 'em, the black Cata|logue of <HI>Eustathians, Macedonians, Anomoioi, Eunomians, Photinians, Luciferians, Anthropo|morphites, Donatists, Appollonarians, Dimeritae, Massiliani, Antidicomorianitae, Collyridiani, Me|tangismonitae, Psathyrians, Euti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hians, Selucia|ni, Patriciani,</HI> with a long and almost endless <HI>Et caetera.</HI> All which Heresies rose out of the bottomless Pit, in about Seventy Years space, in the same Church. Whence one Council was conveen'd after another, to draw up new <HI>Creeds,</HI> and impose new <HI>Subscriptions,</HI> until almost e|very Article of Christianity was both condem|ned
<PB N="8" REF="003156_0005_0FF081A87208B358" MS="y">
and established. This was the <HI>Mark</HI> set by Providence upon the first <HI>Subscription</HI> of this kind, that was ever imposed in the World; and this the Defence and Propagation of Truth that followed from it.</P>
<P>I might exemplify this Case, by Instances of the same kind, in all the succeeding Ages of the Church, unto the present Time. I might particularly shew you, how this imposing and subscribing of <HI>Creeds,</HI> was both an Inlet to the <HI>Papacy,</HI> and a continued Engine of Papal Ty|ranny, after the <HI>Pope</HI> was mounted upon the <HI>Seven-headed Beast.</HI> I might also observe, on the contrary, how the <HI>Waldenses, Wickliffians, Lollards</HI> &amp;c. flourished in Purity of Doctrine and Discipline, defended and propagated the Truth pure and uncorrupt against the utmost Opposition of Hell and Earth, without any <HI>Im|position</HI> or <HI>Subscription.</HI> But we need not look so far back, nor go farther from Home, than the Countries where you and I were born, to find brightest Examples of this kind. The Presbyterian Church in <HI>Ireland,</HI> subsisted some Ages in Peace and Purity, to the Honour of their Profession, and Envy of their malignant Enemies; and thus might they probably have continued, had not the Fire of <HI>Subscription</HI> con|sumed their Glory; and this Engine of Division broke them to pieces, disunited them in Inte|rest, in Comunion, and in Charity; and ren|dered them the Grief of their Friends, and the Scorn of their Enemies. And on the other
<PB N="9" REF="003156_0005_0FF081A87208B358">
Hand, the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> have all continued from their first Foundation <HI>Non-subscribers</HI>; and yet retain their first Faith and Love. From all this I think it naturally fol|lows, that <HI>Subscription</HI> is not Necessary for the Being, or Well-being of the Church; unless Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions and Heresies, are necessary to that End,</P>
<P N="3">3. I'm sure this Argument is very little to the Purpose if <HI>Subscriptions</HI> have no direct Tenden|cy to mantain and defend the Truths of the Gospel; and propagate them uncorrupt to Poste|rity. It seems you were not aware of this Ob|jection; but have taken for granted, as a first Principle not to be debated, that <HI>Subscription</HI> is not only a means, but the best means to this End. You have built all your Superstructure upon this <HI>Postulatum</HI>; and therefore, if upon Exami|nation it proves a Sandy Foundation, you know the Fate of your whole Fabric. Let us then consider the Case a little. Let us view this For|tification you are for erecting about a poor de|fenceless <HI>Laish</HI>; and see whether it don't agree to that Description <HI>Neh.</HI> iv.3. <HI>If a Fox go up, he shall even break down this Stone Wall.</HI></P>
<P>You'll readily grant that there's no Need of Subscriptions, for confirming and establishing the sincere Christian and orthodox Professor in the true Faith. He is influenced with higher Motives, he is establish'd upon a more stable Foundation; and <HI>kept by the Power of God
<PB N="10" REF="003156_0006_0FF081AC59CB7078" MS="y">
through Faith unto Salvation.</HI> There wants no Laws nor Subscription to secure them, whom all the Malice of Men and Devils can neithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> draw nor drive into Apostacy. These will b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ready enough to profess their Faith <HI>They'll no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be asham'd of the Gospel of Christ.</HI> And they'l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be sincere in their Profession, being so far re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mov'd from Hypocrisy; and from <HI>loving an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> making a Lye.</HI></P>
<P>You'll also grant, that <HI>Subscription</HI> can't b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of any Service to open profess'd and declar'd He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reticks, either with Respect to themselves, or t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Jurisdiction they belong to. 'Twill be o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no Use with Respect to themselves. It won'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> let new Light into their Minds, to dispel th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mists of Ingnorance and Error; nor will it con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quer the Perverseness of their Wills, and bring 'em to bow their Necks unto Christ's Yoak&punc; Neither can it be of any Use with respect to us as we are an Ecclesiastical Judicatory, to direct our Conduct towards them.

<P>It therefore remains that there can be no Prospect of Advantage from <HI>Subscriptions,</HI> save only as a Means to keep <HI>Hypocrites</HI> out of the Church, to detect cover'd and <HI>conceal'd Here|ticks</HI>; or (as you express it) to search out, dis|cover, and set a Mark upon secret Bosom Ene|mies to the Truth. Let us therefore next consi|der, whether the Imposition of <HI>Subscription</HI> is like to attain this End.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003156_0006_0FF081AC59CB7078">Who can be imagined more ready to subscribe blindfold, whatever is imposed, than such Men as are last described.

It is impossible to imagine, what Advantage can accrue from <HI>Subscription,</HI> that can't be attain'd by this <HI>Means</HI> only.

<P>I would again propose a strict <HI>Discipline</HI> in
<PB N="18" REF="003156_0010_0FF081B55BB87F20">
the Church, especially with respect to <HI>Scanda|lous Ministers,</HI> and all such as can be prov'd guilty of dangerous Errors. By a seasonable rejecting of whom, we may prevent the Pro|gress of Immorality, or <HI>Heresy</HI> among us.

<P>I wold lastly propose, that the Ministers of the Gospel be most diligent, faithful, and pain|ful, in the discharge of their awful Trust. That by their sedulous Application to their Work, they may instruct the ignorant, establish the wavering, and convince the erroneous. Or to sum up all in a Word, that they may be instru|mental to convert poor perishing Sinners to <HI>Christ,</HI> and thereby to have them built upon the <HI>Foundation of God that standeth sure.</HI> Such painful Address to our Business, join'd with fer|vent Prayer for Success, is the proper Engine to subvert the Kingdom of Satan in all it's Bran|ches; and to confirm and establish the King|dom of our Lord <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> among us. See 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii.13 and <HI>Fin.</HI> 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> iv.1, 2.3.</P>
<P>Thus Sir, I have something particularly con|sidered this first Argument; and I think fully answer'd whatever occurs in the <HI>Overture.</HI> For allowing <HI>that a Principal of spiritual Wisdom would direct the Church of Christ, to fortify it|self against all assaults</HI> that <HI>secret Bosom Ene|mies to the Truth, are as dangerous as any what|soever.</HI> Admit, that <HI>we are so a particular
<PB N="19" REF="003156_0010_0FF081B55BB87F20">
Church, as not to be a Part of any particular Church in the World</HI>; that <HI>we are in no small Danger of being corrupted in Doctrinals</HI>; that <HI>we are too much like the People of</HI> Laish, <HI>in a careless defenceless Condition</HI>; that <HI>we are sur|rounded with many pernicious Corruptions in Doctrine</HI>; that <HI>our Poverty renders us uncapable to plant a Seminary of Learning among us</HI>; and that <HI>the Edge of our Zeal against prevailing Errors is blunted.</HI> If we allow all these Rea|sons for our being upon our Defence, and for our endeavouring to propagate the Truths of the Gospel to Posterity: Yet it all makes nothing for the <HI>Subscription</HI> under Considerati|on, if that ben't the proper Means to answer these Ends, which I think I have fully prov'd.</P>
<P>Your second and last Argument, I find (in page 7.) thus propos'd. <HI>As it is observed in the Overture, we are an intire Church of our selves, so as not to be a Part of any particular Church in the World, with which we are join'd as a Part. Now every Collection of People, which are united together under a politic Body, whether ecclesiastical or civil, must have some Bond of Union, by which the several Parts are join'd to|gether, to make or constitute them one entire whole</HI>&punc; &amp;c. <HI>Now, until we fulfil the Intent of the following Overture, I am at a loss where to find a sufficient external Bond of Union, by which we are united,</HI> &amp;c. In answer to which, I shall offer these three Things to your Consideration. (1.) That there may be a sufficient <HI>Bond of Un|ion</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="003156_0011_0FF081B753C8DD78" MS="y">
without Subscription. (2.) That we have already all the external <HI>Bond of Union,</HI> that the Scriptures require of us. (3.) That what has a natural Tendency to <HI>Disunion</HI> and Divi|sion, can't (agreeable to the Laws of Charity) be prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s'd as a <HI>Bond of Union.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. There may be a sufficient <HI>Bond of Union</HI> without <HI>Subscription.</HI> A joint Acknowledge|ment of our Lord <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> for our common Head, of the sacred Scriptures for our Common Standard both in Faith and Practice; with a joint Agreement in the same essential and ne|cessary Articles of Christianity, and the same Methods of Worship and Discipline, are a suf|ficient external <HI>Bond of Union,</HI> either for the Being or Well-being of any Church under Hea|ven. To this you object. <HI>How is it possible for us to know concerning one another, or for others to know concerning us, in what Sence we take or understand the Scriptures,</HI> &amp;c.? To which I answer.</P>
<P N="1">1. By retorting the Objection upon you. How is it possible for us to know concerning one another, or for others to know concerning us, in what Sence we take or understand the <HI>Assembl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s Confession,</HI> suppose we all subscribe it.</P>
<P N="2">2. It's possible for us to continue in strict Examination of Candidates for the Ministry, that by that Means we may discover whether they be orthodox or erroneous; and in what Sence they understand the Scriptu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P N="3">3. It's possible for us to reject <HI>Hereticks</HI> when
<PB N="21" REF="003156_0011_0FF081B753C8DD78">
we find any such among us. For tho' we have no just claim to impose our Faith, and our In|terpretation of Scripture upon any Man; yet we have an undoubted Right to reject their Opinions, when we think them erroneous; and to refuse Communion with them in sacred Or|dinances, and even in the exercise of Church Government, when we suppose their <HI>Heresy</HI> ren|ders them unqualified for it. This (as I've shewn above) is what the Scriptures enjoin up|on us. And if these Scriptural Methods be due|ly attended, what further external <HI>Bond of Un|ion</HI> can be wanting? <HI>Profess'd Deists, Socinians, Armi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ians and Free-thinkers, can't be united to us in the same Church Government,</HI> as you sup|pose p. 10. if these Rules of <HI>Christ</HI> be duely ob|served.</P>
<P>You object again, that an <HI>Erastian, who sup|poses that Christ has left us at Liberty, to chuse what Form of Government we think most agreea|ble, may freely join with us in the actual Exercise of Presbyterian Government.</HI> To which I an|swer. Why not? I hope your Charity is hardly so restricted to those of our own Sentiments in this Matter, as to suppose this a <HI>damning Here|sy</HI>; or an <HI>Error</HI> that incapacitates for Commu|nion in all Ordinances. And I can't see what Prejudice these can be to our Constitution, so long as they heartily join in our Methods of Di|scipline; and thereby declare 'em best for us, whether they believe 'em of <HI>Divine Right</HI> or not. Can't we live peaceably with those who live
<PB N="22" REF="003156_0012_0FF081B90FCAD4D8">
peaceably with us, and join with us in consult|ing and concerning the Interest of Christ's King|dom among us, without breaking in upon their Consciences; and destroying their Right of judging for themselves?</P>
<P>I might here subjoin, that a view of this Af|fair from the very Infancy of Christianity will convince us, that the Churches of <HI>Christ</HI> have been always better united, and every way more flourishing, when no other external <HI>Bond of Union</HI> but what is now propos'd, have been im|pos'd upon 'em, than when they have been fet|ter'd with <HI>Subscriptions,</HI> and other Impositions and Institutions of human Invention; as I have something exemplified above.</P>
<P N="2">II. We have already all the external Bond of Union, that the Scriptures require of us. We all of us for ought I know, have <HI>one Faith, one Lord, one Baptism,</HI> and one Discipline. And what more is needful? You indeed require, that we should all subscribe to one Confession: But does our Lord Jesus Christ require this? Have you cited, or can you cite, any thing like a Precept or Direction to this Purpose, from that <HI>one Lawgiver who is able to save or destroy? Who art thou</HI> then <HI>that judgest another</HI>? Jam. iv.12. You indeed p. 9. infer from <HI>Heb.</HI> v.12. compar'd with Chap. vi.1. that <HI>there were both rudimental Principles, for the use of young and more ignorant Professors; and more difficult and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sterious Doctrines of the Christian Faith, that were to come after the former, collected for the
<PB N="23" REF="003156_0012_0FF081B90FCAD4D8" MS="y">
Use of the Church,</HI> in the Apostolic Times. N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w were this granted, what does it argue for <HI>Subscriptions</HI>? Can you your self pretend that these were the Dictates of fallible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, impo|sed and subscribed in those Times? Or can you pretend, that there is no Difference between <HI>Catechizing</HI> our Children, and <HI>Subscribing Con|fessions?</HI> To what Purpose then do you quote this Scripture?</P>
<P N="3">III. What has a natural Tendency to <HI>Dis-union</HI> and Division, can't (agreable to the Laws of Cha|rity) be propos'd as a <HI>Bond of Union.</HI> What you have offer'd in answer to this, does Nothing af|fect the present Case; because you <HI>apprehend Subscription a proper Antidote against Division; and if it should in the Event have other Effects, it's only by Accident</HI> (p. 12.) If it does therefore appear, that this has a natural and direct Ten|dency to <HI>Division,</HI> you have said Nothing to the Purpose. Let us then consider this Case.</P>
<P>I must first observe to you, that the requiring and enjoining any unscriptural Terms of Union or Communion, is a direct and natural Means to procure <HI>Rents</HI> and <HI>Divisions,</HI> in the Church. For there will be such thinking and serious Per|sons, whose Consciences will startle at these Innovations; and who will sooner dye, than sub|mit to these Injunctions against their Conscien|ces. A <HI>Schism</HI> will follow. And who are the criminal Causes of this <HI>Schism,</HI> they who refuse to sin against their Consciences; or they that lay this Unnecessary Burthen upon'em&punc; If the for|mer,
<PB N="24" REF="003156_0013_0FF081BC51B6DDC8">
we are brought into the midst of <HI>Rome,</HI> must <HI>believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the Church believes,</HI> and expect Sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation by that public Faith. If the latter, it necessarily foll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ws that these Unscriptural Institutions (and such is the debated <HI>Subscrip|tion</HI>) are directly and formally, the <HI>troublers of Gods Israel.</HI> This Argument has been con|stantly used by our Dissenters from the Church of <HI>England.</HI> It has hitherto triumphed over all <HI>Impositions,</HI> and remain'd unanswerable, and will ever do so.</P>
<P>I can't but further observe to you under this Head, that we all of us know, that that Subscrip|tion under Debate, has been scrupled and oppo|sed by many godly, learn'd, and faithful <HI>Mini|sters</HI> of Christ; that it has made horrible Di|visions and Confusions in other Churches, and that it's like to have the same sad Effects among our selves. And I must therefore take the Free|dom to tell you, that I would not for all the World, be the Author of that Dishonour to God and our holy Profession, and of that <HI>Schism</HI> and Confusion that is like to follow, if this be en|joined by the Syond. No Sir! It's better to dye in the Cause, than to merit that Character in <HI>Rom.</HI> xvi.17.18. For if it be <HI>better for a Man to have a Milstone hung about his Neck, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e cast into the midst of the Sea, than to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffend</HI> ONE <HI>of Christ's little ones,</HI> as <HI>Mat.</HI> xviii.6. How will such be able to account at <HI>Christs Tri|bunal,</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end His <HI>Church</HI> in pieces, and of|fend so MANY of His <HI>Ministers</HI> and other ser|ious

Christians among us, that can't in <HI>Con|science</HI> come into the propos'd Subscription?</P>
<P>Having thus finish'd my <HI>Remarks</HI> upon your Arguments. I shall now pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceed briefly to of|fer you some few more <HI>Objections</HI> against your <HI>Overture.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. I think a <HI>Subscription</HI> to any human Com|posure as the Test of our Orthodoxy, is to make it the <HI>Standard</HI> of our <HI>Faith</HI>; and thereby to give it the Honour only due to the <HI>Word</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> I take a <HI>Subscription</HI> to imply a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lemn Decla|ration to the World, that we believe the Arti|cles subscribed to be the Mind and Will of <HI>God,</HI> free of all Error and Mistake. A <HI>Subscription</HI> in any laxer Sence, is to open a Door to all the Unsincerity in the World. Every one of what-ever Sentiments, may subscribe with his own Reserves; and so the <HI>Subscription</HI> in|stead of a Test of Orthodoxy becomes a Door to Hypocrisy, as I have hinted above. If we subscribe in this Sence, we give to fallible Men, all the Honour due to the Inspired Pen-men of the Sacred Pages; and ascribe that Perfection to human Composures, which no Book but the <HI>Bible,</HI> ever had a just Claim to.</P>
<P>You offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">veral Things to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bviate this Ob|jection&punc; which I shall briefly consider.</P>
<P N="1">1 You tell us (p. 14.) that <HI>the Matter is of Divine Authority, being con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain'd in the Word of God; and the Words tho' compos'd by fallible Men, being agre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able to the Divine Master, tho' falling short of that Perfection that the Scripture
<PB N="26" REF="003156_0014_0FF081C110D8E978">
justly claims, must of Necessity have the Divine Approbation.</HI> But how do you kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w that the <HI>Assemblies Confession</HI> &amp;c. is contain'd in the <HI>Word</HI> of <HI>God? You</HI> indeed, and <HI>we</HI> that agree with you in the same <HI>Creed</HI> do thus interpret the word of God. But I challenge you to bring one Word to evince your Certainty, that our Inter|pretations are agreable to the Meaning of the <HI>Ho|ly Ghost</HI>; and have the Divine Approbation&punc; that any <HI>Sect</HI> under Heaven may n't bring in the same Case Suppose I was now debating with a <HI>Roman-Catholic,</HI> against Subscription to the De|crees of the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trent.</HI> He answers my Objection in the very Words that you do; and tells me that <HI>the Matter is of Divine Authority</HI> &amp;c. what shall I say to him? Shall I tell him that they subvert the Scriptures, and that there are no such Doctrines contain'd in them? Won't he retort the Answer and tell me, that the Ar|gument is the quite contrary Way, that it is <HI>we</HI> who wrest the Scriptures to our own Damna|tion, and <HI>they</HI> are sure that they are in the Right, they being infallible, which we don't pretend to be. Or if you please instead of a <HI>Roman-Catholic</HI> suppose a <HI>Quaker</HI> thus disput|ing; and in the strongest Terms assu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing me, that he has the Witness in himself from the Il|luminations of Gods Holy Spirit, that <HI>Barclays Apology</HI> is contain'd in the Word of God. Now I demand of you&punc; whether we must subscribe these mention'd Books upon this Evidence. If not, what Assurance can you give me, that you
<PB N="27" REF="003156_0014_0FF081C110D8E978">
are in the Right and they not; You are sure of it, so are they of the contrary. You compare Scripture with Scripture, and find your System agreable to the whole Scope of the Gospel. They'll not be behind hand with you in the same Pretence. You suppose yours the most rational System&punc; most worthy of God, and most agreeable to the Circumstances of fallen Man. They ap|ply the same Lofty Attributes to their <HI>Creed,</HI> be it in it self never so inconsistent. If you reply to all this, that <HI>Truth</HI> has certainly from the Nature of Things, the Advantage of <HI>Error.</HI> This is true; but then this also may be urg'd with as good Advantage, by any other Persuasi|on. You have therefore no Refuge left, but a recou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se to <HI>Infallibilty,</HI> which is what I'm now objecting against.</P>
<P>As for your long Discourse&punc; about the Necessity of our subscribing our own Words; and not the Words of Scripture, I have but this short and general Answer to make. Tho' I cant possibly see into your Methods of Reasoning; nor draw your Conclusion from your Premises, yet if it be granted, that our <HI>Confessions</HI> must be in our <HI>own Words,</HI> and not in the Words of Scripture&punc; I don't see how it will follow, that we must there|fore subscribe them. Can't we have Confessions in our own Words, without the Imposition of <HI>Subscription,</HI> Can there be no other Use made of Confessions, but as an exclusive T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st of O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ho|doxy?

Quickning to the careless and secure, for a Help to our Devotions; and even for a public Declaration of our Religious Sentiments. And therefore until you have prov'd a necessary Con|nection between Composing, and <HI>Imposing</HI> or <HI>Subscribing</HI> a Confession, you say Nothing to the Purpose.</P>
<P N="2">2 I can't see how we can impose <HI>Subscriptions</HI> upon others, without Invading His <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alty,</HI> who is sole King and Lawgiver unto His Church; and practicing our selves, what we so l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uely com|plain of in others.

If you mean by this, that it's Tyranny and Persecution for a Church to impose what they <HI>acknowledge</HI> is not founded on the Word of God. I believe it will be difficult to find any Church upon Earth guilty of such Impositions. And if every Church may impose what they <HI>Suppose</HI> to be founded on the Word of God, even the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> must be acquitted from all unwarrant|able Impositions. For they as resolutely claim a Scripture Foundation for all their Articles of Faith, as we can do. And why ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'t they as good Authority to impose their Interpretation of Gods Word, as we have to impose ours? Is not the Imposition of such Interpretations as properly a <HI>Legislatvie</HI> Faculty in us, as it is in them? Are we sure we are in the Right? Don't
<PB N="29" REF="003156_0015_0FF081C401B23828">
they profess the same Certainty? Do we impose our Creeds in Honour to God and His Truth? They have the same Pretence. Do we appoint <HI>Subscription</HI> to keep out Error and Heresy? They are acted by the same Views. Do we im|pose them by ministerial Authority committed to us by Christ. And have not every other So|ciety the same Claim? But the Difficulty is, I find Nothing in the <HI>Divine Oracles</HI> by which either <HI>they,</HI> or <HI>we</HI> can support this Claim; but the direct contrary. <HI>Iam.</HI> iv.12. <HI>Col.</HI> ii.22.23. <HI>Rom.</HI> xiv.4.9. <HI>Mat.</HI> xxviii.18. &amp;c.

<Q>God alone is Lord of the Conscience; and hath left it free from the Doctrines and Commandments of Men which are in any thing contrary to His Word, or BESIDE it, in Matters of Faith or Worship. So that to believe such Doctrines, or obey such Commands out of Conscience, is to betray true Liberty of Conscience; and the requi|ring a implicite Faith, and an absolute and blind Obedience, is to destroy Liberty of Con|science and Reason also.</Q>
And I must tell you that to <HI>subscribe</HI> this Article, and <HI>impose</HI> the rest, appears to me the most gloring Contra|diction.</P>
<P>If you reply to this, that there is no <HI>Imposi|tion</HI> design'd. I answer, what is then design'd? Is not <HI>Subscription</HI> propos'd as the Test of Or|thodoxy, as the Terms of Membership with the
<PB N="30" REF="003156_0016_0FF081C5AC856660">
Synod; and of Admission to the Ministry? And if this ben't <HI>Imposition</HI> with a Witness, with all the Penalties annex'd that we are capable of, I don't know what <HI>Imposition</HI> means.</P>
<P>You indeed argue, that <HI>according to our re|corded and common Way of Speaking, 'tis hard to say, whether Subscribers or Non-subscribers would be obliged to seperate.</HI> But pray Sir, what Occasion that either should be obliged to sepe|rate? What Law or what Reason is there for these Injunctions, that must of course produce a Seperation? Why mayn't every one enjoy his own Opinion, and act according to his Con|science in this Matter, without a Seperation? Or why mayn't some middle Way be thought on, that will every Way answer the End pro|pos'd; and give Satisfaction to both Parties? For my own Part, I can cheerfully come into any Method for securing our Faith, that <HI>I</HI> can apprehend consistent with Liberty of Con|science, and Christian Freedom.</P>
<P>You subjoin, <HI>if one Party think it an Imposi|tion to be required to subscribe, as a Term or Condition of our continuing united as formerly. The other Part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon as good grounds, may e|steem it an Imposition, to be oblig'd to continue in the Neglect of what in Conscience they conceive to be (as the Case now stands) a necessary Duty incumbent upon them.</HI> I answer. Whoever think it their Duty, shall have my free Vote, to sub|scribe with both Hands if they please: But I hope none of you will imagine your selves
<PB N="31" REF="003156_0016_0FF081C5AC856660">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound in Conscience, to Lord it over your Brethren.</P>
<P N="3">3 If I <HI>subscribe,</HI> or concur in imposing <HI>Subscription</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n others, I must either do it as a necessary Duty; or as a Thing in it self indifferent. Not the former, until you can find some Scripture that requires <HI>Sub|scription</HI> to human Composures; and even to this under Debate in particular, in Contradistinction to all others elsewhere impos'd, which I am sure you can never do. If it be in it self indifferent who gave the Synod Au|thority to take away <HI>the Liberty, with which Christ has made as free?</HI> We ought to leave Things as Christ has left 'em; And on the one Hand, not to <HI>bring our selves under the Power of any</HI> 1 Cor. vi.12. Nor on the other Hand, to <HI>destroy them with our Meat, for whom Christ dyed</HI> Rom. xiv.15.</P>
<P N="4">4 I know not how to concur, in making this <HI>Subscrip|tion</HI> the Terms of our admitting <HI>Candidates</HI> to the Mini|stry, least I keep them out of Christs Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eyard, whom He has sent to labour there; and qualified for glorious Service in His Church. Such as these may (as I do) Scru|ple <HI>Subscription</HI> to any human Composure; Or they may be doubtful as to some Particulars in the impos'd <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a,</HI> and yet be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound in the Faith. Or they may not satisfactorily understand some of the <HI>credenda</HI> thus enjoin'd; and yet have very promising Capacity for the Sacred Service. If all qualified Candidates can well understand the whole of that large <HI>Confession,</HI> it's just Matter of sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me to me, who have be'n a Minister between twenty and thirty Years; and yet don't un|derstand several Things in it, as I shall be ready to give a Particular Account when desir'd. I'm afraid therefore, that most of our <HI>Candidates</HI> must subscribe blindfold, or be kept out of the Ministry from invinci|ble Necesity. And is this to <HI>receive one another, as Christ also receiv'd us to the Glory of God</HI> Rom. xv.7? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s this charitably to bear with M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns differing Senti|ments in Matters not essential, as the Apostle requires, <HI>Phil.</HI> iii.15 16.?</P>
