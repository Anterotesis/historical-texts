<HEAD>GENERAL PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>EVE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I have been of age to distinguish between good and evil, I have observed, that, in this blessed country of ours, the men in power have pursued one uniform track of tax|ing and corrupting the people, and increasing court-influence in parliament, while the pretended patriots have exclaimed against those measures, at least till themselves got into power, and had an op|portunity of carrying on the same plan of govern|ment; which they seldom failed to do, while the constitution was drawing nearer to its ruin, and our country lay bleeding.</P>
<P>I was sure, there was a right and a wrong in go|vernment, as in other things. I knew, that the spirit of the constitution, and the interest of the nation are fixed things, not to be altered backward and forward according as a <HI>Harley,</HI> a <HI>Walpole,</HI> or a <HI>Pelham,</HI> was in, or out of place. I saw much quibbling and fallacy in our party-squabbles, while I was certain, that there was a true and a false in politics, as in all other objects of human under|standing.</P>
<P>I determined to take the sense of mankind on the great and interesting points of government;
<PB N="vi" REF="013851_0005_0F9E2B76CF905830">
and to see what experience teaches to expect from wise and upright, as well as from blundering and corrupt administration.</P>
<P>I applied the leisure hours of many years to the perusal of the best historical and political books, an|cient and modern, and made collections to the quan|tity of many folio volumes.</P>
<P>I considered, that history is the inexhaustible mine, out of which political knowledge is to be brought up. This was observed by <HI>Plato,</HI> and in consequence he wrote his REPUBLIC, and other poli|tical works. <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s POLITICA are full of wise remarks, drawn chiefly from history. MONTES|QUIEU has collected his admirable work, L'ESPRIT DES LOIX, in great measure, from history. <HI>Monta|gue</HI>'s excellent book on ANCIENT REPUBLICS is wholly made out of the same materials. The abb&eacute; de <HI>St. Pierre</HI> labours in many parts of his <HI>Ouvrages Politiques</HI> (particularly in his Essay, entituled, <HI>Ob|servations pour rendre,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Remarks for rendering the Perusal of Plutarch's Lives more agreeable, and more profitable</HI>) to shew, that there are no means so effec|tual for communicating the most useful instructions to the minds of men, as making observations upon the facts recorded in history. <HI>Alphonsus</HI> V. king of <HI>Arragon,</HI> was wont to say, the dead were the best counsellors. <HI>Rollin</HI> wrote his ANCIENT and ROMAN HISTORIES on purpose that he might have an oppor|tunity
<PB N="vii" REF="013851_0006_0F9E2B78D6C573D8">
of making useful moral and political remarks upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> relate. Our incomparable female historian (Mrs. MA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">AULY) has given the public a new history of the <HI>Stuarts,</HI> for the purpose of inculcating on the people of <HI>Britain</HI> the love of liberty and their country.</P>
<P>That no important historical fact, nor valuable po|litical remark, or as few as possible, might escape me, I went through a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eneral course of such read|ing; particularly the following, <HI>viz.</HI> UNIVERSAL HISTORY, ANCIENT and MODERN, 68 volumes, besides several of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> originals; <HI>Rapin</HI>'s, and two or three other <HI>English</HI> histories; MAGAZINES of the last 10 years; PARLIAMEN|TORY HISTORY, 24 volumes; DEBATES of the Lords and Commons, 30 volumes; <HI>Ancient</HI> and <HI>Modern</HI> Republics, 27 volumes; the <HI>Harleian</HI> MIS|CELLANY, 8 volumes; <HI>Somers</HI>'s Tracts, 16 volumes; the political writings of <HI>Sidney, Locke, Harrington, Gordon, Trenchard, Bolingbroke, St. Pierre, Hume, Montesquieu, Blackstone, Montague, Rymer</HI>'s FOE|DERA, STATUTES at LARGE, STATE PAPERS, &amp;c. And it is my purpose to apply what may re|main to me of life and leisure to the same study: and if I find any new matter interesting to my country, which I cannot insert in the body of this work, it shall be given the public in a supplemental volume.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="013851_0007_0F9E2B79B6CF9208">Most writers have a set of doctrines they would lay before the public, and they peruse authors on the same subject, in order to strengthen their own as|sertions by the authority of established writers. But I read in order to observe <HI>what</HI> the best historical and political writers have said, and to lay <HI>that</HI> be|fore the public, as decisive. And as I did not, in collecting my materials, trust to indexes; but turn|ed over, page by page, many hundreds of volumes, the matter I collected came at last to such a prodigious heap,
<Q><L>(&mdash;rudis indigestaque moles,</L>
<L>&mdash;congestaque eodem</L>
<L>Non bene junctarum discordia semina rerum.</L>
<BIBL><HI>OVID.</HI>)</BIBL></Q>
that I foresaw, I should have no small difficulty in arranging this chaos into a system. Nor have I been able to please myself at last in this respect. For many articles are, I doubt, not referred to the heads, to which they most properly belong; and many articles relate to several heads. I hope, however, by means of a table at the end of the whole, to make up for this deficiency.</P>
<P>I have every where referred to the volume and page of my authors, with as much correctness as I could, that my readers may satisfy themselves; and, if they think fit, may peruse what I have not quoted. Where I have put turned commas, I quote verbatim; and where I translate&punc; or
<PB N="ix" REF="013851_0008_0F9E2B7AE528BDB8">
abridge the sense of my authors, I believe the reader will find I give it gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine. When I insert short remarks of my own in the midst of other matter, I inclose them with brackets for distinction's sake.</P>
<P>The political authors I quote are not all of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> authority. To most of them I appeal on account of the weight, which their opinion has justly obtained; others I introduce because they have expressed the sentiment I would inculcate, with such clearness and strength as must convince every reasonable reader. In cases where it may be supposed a writer may be partial to a particular sentiment, it is an advantage to give his reader the same sentiment in the words of another, rather than in his own, though the au|thor quoted may not be of the first rank for merit and weight.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to have extracted from my au|thors, or to have applied all that may be found in them interesting to this country. But the number of facts and remarks I have extracted and applied, is so considerable, that I think the collection must be va|luable, as tending to save gentlemen, who would im|prove themselves in political knowledge, a great deal of time and labour, and as serving to bring together a multitude of useful historical precedents, and of wise reflections, scattered in many hundered volumes; upon which materials alone it is possible to found any solid political principles.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="013851_0009_0F9E2B7B5D6ED5F8">Every body has observed, that, on political sub|jects, the opinions of men are peculiarly vague, un|settled, and contradictory, because all men will, and in a free country, <HI>ought</HI> to judge of politics. There are indeed many particulars to be attended to, various views of things to be taken, and many comparisons to be made, in order to form just and steady prin|ciples of politics. And these employments of the mind requiring leisure, thought, and labour, it is not to be wondered, that few ever come to deserve, in a general and extensive manner, the character of sound politicians; though it is certain that every man of common sense may, if unbiassed, very clearly see wherein his country's great interest consists.</P>
<P>The same observation may be made on politics as one of the fathers has made on holy Scripture; The lamb may wade in them, and the elephant swim.</P>
<P><Q>The science of politics
[extensively considered]
is as much superior to all others,</Q>
says <HI>S. Pierre,</HI>
<Q>as the whole is superior to a part.</Q> For it compre|hends all human knowledge, and, to be a good po|litician, a man must have a general knowledge of all arts and sciences <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>S. Pierre,</HI> OUVR. POLIT. VI.14.</NOTE>.
On the other hand, it is observ|ed by <HI>Locke,</HI> That politics [in the common and con|fined sense] are only common sense applied to na|tional, instead of private concerns.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="013851_0010_0F9E2B7C17704E20">Some thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re right in theory, for instance, but not in practice, and contrariwise. Hereditary suc|cession to regal power applied to the test of reason, appears, <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> consummately absurd. But elective monarchy, if we judge of it from its effects in <HI>Po|land,</HI> is an inexhaustible fountain of mischief to a country. Some measures a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in general salutary; but pursued at particular times, would ruin all. In distinguishing wisely lies the superiority of genius in statesmen.</P>
<P><Q>There are no such mighty talents necessary for government as some, who pretend to them, without possessing them, would make us believe. Honest affec|tions, and common qualifications, are sufficient, and the administration has always been best executed, and the public liberty best preserved, near the origin and rise of states, when plain sense, and common honesty alone governed public affairs, and the morals of men were not corrupted by riches and luxury, nor their understanding perverted by subtleties and distinctions. Great abilities have generally, if not always, been employed to mislead the honest unwary multitude, and draw them out of the plain paths of public virtue and public good <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">CATO'S LETT. I.178.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In a country which pretends to be free, and where, consequently, the people ought to have weight in the government, it is peculiarly neces|sary
<PB N="xii" REF="013851_0011_0F9E2B7CD01ADD20">
that the <HI>people</HI> be possessed of just notions of the interest of their country, and be qualified to distinguish between those who are faithful to them, and those who betray them.</P>
<P>It must, I think, fill every generous mind with indignation, to see our good-natured countrymen a|bused over and over, from generation to generation, by the same stale dog-tricks repeatedly played upon them, by a succession of pretended patriots, who, by these means, have screwed out their predecessors, and wormed themselves into their places. To teach the people a set of solid political principles, the knowledge of which may make them proof against such gross a|buse, is one great object of this publication.</P>
<P>If the people do not look with an eye of severe and unremitting jealousy, after their own great and weighty concerns, in whose hands must they leave them? The answer is, In those of a ministry. And what hope is there, that in such hands they will be safe? In these collections, under the article MINIS|TERS, it will too plainly appear, from history, that ministers have generally been a set of ambitious, or avarcious grandees, who have, by all the worst kinds of arts, thrust themselves into power, in order to raise (as they call it) themselves and their fami|lies, and to fill their pockets. Entering into public stations with such views, it is to be supposed, that they would form to themselves an interest
<PB N="xiii" REF="013851_0012_0F9E2B7DD5F09F78">
totally separate and diametrically contrary to that of the people, and that they would debauch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he house of commons to join them against their constituents. And is it not then necessary, that the people should be qualified, and disposed to take care of their own interests, and secure themselves against so formidable a set of internal enemies?</P>
<P><Q>None can be said to know things well, who do not know them in their beginnings,</Q>
says Sir <HI>W. Temple</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pref. to HIST. EN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q>All ought to know what is right, and what is wrong in public affairs,</Q>
says <HI>St. Amand</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pref. to HIST. PARL.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Not only the people, but our statesmen and legis|lators, may from the following collections gain lights, and meet with hints, which, if properly pursued, may lead them to measures of a more generous kind, than that series of poor and temporary expedients, by which they have long made a shift to patch up matters, and barely keep the machine of government from bursting in ruins about them, while the effici|ency of the constitution (as will too clearly appear in the sequel) is annihilated.</P>
<P>The ablest politicians have always been the most desirous of information. The great <HI>Colbert</HI> used to declare, that he thought his time well spent in perus|ing an hundred proposals for advancing the wealth,
<PB N="ivx" REF="013851_0013_0F9E2B7EC038D6C8">
the commerce, and the glory of <HI>France,</HI> if but one of them deserved to be encouraged <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Postlethw.</HI> BRIT. TRUE SYSTEM, XLV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If, on the contrary, any <HI>Leviathan</HI> of power shews himself bent on other objects, than the public good, and with a brutal effrontery presumes publicly to turn into ridicule all that tends to national benefit, and to declare, as some statesmen have been known to do, That he knows of only one engine of government, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>Finding every man's price, and giving it to him;</Q>
it is to be hoped, that the independent people will find a hook for his jaws, and be able to drag him out of that sea of power, in which he wallows, that the vessel of the state may sail in safety. To point out those enemies of mankind, and to animate the in|dependent people against them, is as great a service as can be done the public. Whether these collections will, in any degree, produce this effect, remains to be seen.</P>
<P>Some courtly readers may think I have put too much gall into my ink, when describing the political abuses, which disgrace our country: But Mr. <HI>Gor|don</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">CATO'S LETT. II.49.</NOTE> says,
<Q>No man can be too desirous of the glory and security of his country, nor too angry at its ill usage, nor too revengeful against those, who abuse and betray it.</Q></P>
<P>When Sir <HI>I. Barnard, A. D.</HI> 1740, was cen|sured in the house of commons by Sir <HI>W. Yonge,</HI>
<PB N="xv" REF="013851_0014_0F9E2B7F122F55A0">
for calling the seamens bill by its proper name, he answered as follows.</P>
<P><Q>I have always heard it represented as an instance of integrity when the tongue and heart move in con|cert, when the words are representations of the sen|timents; and have therefore hitherto endeavoured to explain my arguments with perspicuity, and to im|press my sentiments with force. I have thought it hypocrisy to treat stupidity with reverence, or honour nonsense with the ceremony of confutation. As knavery, so folly, that is not reclaimable, is to be speedily dispatched, business is to be freed from ob|struction, and society from nuisance. Now, Sir, when I am censured by those whom I may offend by the use of terms correspondent with my ideas, I will not, by a tame and silent submission, give reason to suspect, that I am conscious of a fault, but will treat the accusation with open contempt, and shew no greater regard to the abettors than to the authors of absurdity. That decency is of great use in public debates, I shall readily allow; it may sometimes shel|ter folly from ridicule, and preserve villainy from pub|lic detection; nor is it ever more carefully supported than when measures are promoted, which nothing can preserve from contempt but the solemnity with which they are established. Decency is a proper circum|cumstance; but liberty is the essence of parliamentary disquisitions. Liberty is the parent of truth: but truth and decency are sometimes at variance: all men
<PB N="xvi" REF="013851_0015_0F9E2B8095924B08">
and all propositions are to be treated here as they de|serve; and there are many who have no claim either to respect or decency.&#38;</Q></P>
<P>I expect the sons of slavery to cry out,
<Q>The au|thor is a republican, a discontented party-man, a ja|cobite, a papist.</Q>
So the <HI>Iews</HI> stigmatised the primi|tive christians, and the papists to this day the pro|testants with the odious appellation of heretics. The court-sycophants in <HI>Charles</HI> I's times called the friends of liberty puritans, and the <HI>Walpolians</HI> called the op|posers of that arch-corrupter disaffected. But wisdom is justified of her children. Let our courtiers over|throw the facts and the reasonings in the following pages. If they cannot, they are to yield to truth, were it delivered to them even by a papist.</P>
<P>I would wish the reader to think I write in the spirit of a true independent whig, whose character Mr. <HI>Gordon</HI> describes as follows.</P>
<P><Q>An independent whig scorns all implicit faith in the state, as well as the church. The authority of names is nothing to him; he judges all men by their actions and behaviour, and hates a knave of his own party as much as he despises a fool of another. He consents not that any man or body of men shall do what they please. He claims a right of examin|ing all public measures, and if they deserve it, of censuring them. As he never saw much
<PB N="xvii" REF="013851_0016_0F9E2B81850AC580">
power possessed without some abuse, he takes upon him to watch those that have it; and to acquit, or expose them, according as they apply it to the good of their country, or their own crooked purposes <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gord.</HI> TRACTS, I.311.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Others may alledge, that a private gentleman, who has never been employed in the state, is less likely to be of service to the public by writing on political sub|jects. Let <HI>Harrington</HI> answer them.</P>
<P><Q>It was in the time of <HI>Alexander,</HI> the greatest prince and commander of his age, that <HI>Aristotle,</HI> with scarce inferior applause and equal fame, being a private man, wrote that excellent piece of prudence in his cabinet, which is called his <HI>Politics,</HI> going upon far other principles than those of <HI>Alexander</HI>'s government, which it has long outlived. The like did <HI>Titus Livius</HI> in the time of <HI>Augustus,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI> in the time of <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. and <HI>Machiavel</HI> when <HI>Italy</HI> was under princes that afforded him not the ear. These works nevertheless are all of the most esteemed and applauded in this kind; nor have I found any man whose like endeavours have been per|secuted since <HI>Plato</HI> by <HI>Dionysius.</HI> I study not with|out great examples, nor out of my calling; either arms, or this art, being the proper trade of a gentle|man. A man may be intrusted with a ship, and a
<PB N="xviii" REF="013851_0017_0F9E2B82A1B5C2C0">
good pilot too, yet not understand how to make sea charts. To say that a man may not write of go|vernment, except he be a magistrate, is as absurd as to say, that a man may not make a sea chart, unless he be a pilot. It is known, that <HI>Christopher Colum|bus</HI> made a chart in his cabinet, that found out the <HI>Indies.</HI> The magistrate, that was good at his steerage, never took it ill of him that brought him a chart, seeing whether he would use it or no, was at his own choice; and if flatterers, being the worst sort of crows, did not pick out the eyes of the living, the ship of government at this day throughout Chris|tendom had not struck so often as she has done. To treat of affairs, says <HI>Machiavel,</HI> which as to the con|duct of them appertain to others, may be thought a great boldness; but if I commit errors in writing, these may be known without danger; whereas, if they commit errors in acting, such come not other|wise to be known than in the ruin of the common|wealth <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">OCEANA, p. 235.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>I do not pretend to enter far into political contro|versy. Life is not long enough to dispute all that is disputable in so boundless a subject as politics, or to give the <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> of all controverted points.</P>
<P>If I sufficiently prove a point, as, That a standing army is dangerous to liberty, That placemen in the
<PB N="xix" REF="013851_0018_0F9E2B82D2F9F0D0">
house of commons are inconsistent with the necessary independence of the representative body, &amp;c. it signi|fies little what may be urged in defence of those a|buses. For though,
<Q><HI>Audi alteram partem,</HI> Hear both sides,</Q>
is a good maxim in law, yet there are cases, when that is needless. If there be sufficient positive proof, that the accused was at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> at the hour, in which a murdered person was killed at <HI>London,</HI> it can signify little to hear presumptions of his guilt, unless it were to give a declaimer an oppor|tunity of shining.</P>
<P>As to the article of <HI>style,</HI> I am in hopes, every candid reader will allow, that the collector of such a variety of matter could not well spend time in ga|thering the flowers of <HI>Parnassus.</HI> Such a work as this, adorned with the flights of rhetoric, would re|semble an anchor (would to God this work might prove an anchor to the tempest-tossed state!) orna|mented with carving and gilding. And I cannot help remarking here, that, of late years, we seem to have passed from too great a negligence of style to an excess on the laboured and finical side. I have, in what of the following is written by me, aimed at perspicuity.</P>
<P>The worthlessness of the great is often not less <HI>ri|diculous</HI> than it is odious. In remarking upon it, I have sometimes been forced to laugh, though with a heavy heart. This, as I indulge it but seldom, I hope the reader will excuse.</P>

<P><HI>Shaftsbury</HI> carries this point so far as to set up (very erroneously in my opinion) ridicule for a test of truth, instead of truth for a test of ridicule. Even the inspired writers have not disdained the use of ri|dicule <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See I KINGS, XVIII.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Though the subject of the intended subsequent vo|lumes be the continuation of what is treated in this first, <HI>viz.</HI> an enquiry into public abuses, and means of correcting them; it is my intention, that this and every succeeding volume, be, in such a manner com|plete and independent, as to be fit to stand by itself without any of the others; as if each volume was a different book.</P>
<P>In this volume, for instance, I have endeavoured to shew, that our parliaments are, at present, upon such a foot, as to the inadequate state of representation, the enormous length of their period, and ministerial in|fluence prevailing in them, that their efficiency for the good of the people is nearly annihilated, and the
<PB N="xxi" REF="013851_0020_0F9E2B8451096B70">
subversion of the constitution, and ruin of the state is (without timely reformation of these abuses) the con|sequence unavoid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bly to be expected.</P>
<P>If the candid reader finds, that all this is but too effectually proved in this first volume, then may this first volume be properly said to be complete, and in|dependent on those intended to follow.</P>
<P>Those minute critics, whom Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> dignifies and distinguishes by the title of Haberdashers of small wares, may plume themselves upon finding some errors and inaccuracies in this work. In the list of boroughs, for instance, which send in the majority of the house of commons, two or three places are said to send 2 members each, whereas they send only one each. But in that calculation an error of 1000, or 10,000 voters is nothing toward invalidating the asser|tion to be proved: And the case will be the same in many other instances. If any mistakes of importance are pointed out to the author, he will thankfully ac|knowledge them. And if he should have occasion to publish a new edition, corrected, or improved, he will take care, that the <HI>first</HI> purchasers have the cor|rections and improvements <HI>gratis.</HI></P>
<P>It never was my design to form a <HI>system</HI> of politics; therefore I did not hold myself obliged to treat of all political subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="013851_0021_0F9E2B869A144118">On land war I have collected little, besides con|siderations, shewing, that we have hardly ever had any occasion to intangle ourselves with the disputes be|tween the powers on the continent, unless where we could employ our <HI>naval</HI> force with success.</P>
<P>Commerce is an immense field, into which, I sel|dom enter; the comprehensive Dictionary on that subject by Mr. <HI>Postlethwayte,</HI> and History by my late esteemed friend Mr. <HI>Anderson,</HI> having superseded my labour. In these two books, and the original authors quoted in them, is contained a treasure of valuable remarks on that most interesting subject, to which every public-spirited person in the kingdom ought to attend.</P>
<P>The subjects treated of in this volume are drawn out in the following table of contents. If the public shews a disposition to receive favourably the remain|der of what I have collected, it shall be published with all convenient speed; as there is but little wanting to fit it for the press. For the remaining vo|lumes, I have by me large collections on the follow|ing heads, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Of corruption in general; of degeneracy in this country; of manners, education, luxury, adultery, duelling, &amp;c. of liberty in general; of various forms of government, their respective advantages and disadvan|tages; of <HI>British</HI> liberty; danger of the loss of liberty, and consequences; of juries, advantages and disadvan|tages;
<PB N="xxiii" REF="013851_0022_0F9E2B885CCAC5F8">
of law, and its grievances; of colonies, and the proper methods for encouraging them; of the army, and dangers from it; advantages of a militia; the ruinous effects of continental con|nexions; the importance of the navy; the conduct of finances, comprehending taxes, customs, excises, national debt, stock-jobbing, &amp;c.; a view of the arts of wicked ministers, and favourites; character and conduct of kings; and of lords; a display of priest|craft; importance of population, comprehending observations on provisions, monopolies, cultivation of land, &amp;c.; of redress by the people, when govern|ment refuses it; of party; of patriotism, true and false; of national prejudice, and many other articles.</P>
<P>The subject of these collections, though political, goes beyond mere <HI>temporal</HI> concerns. It takes in education, manners, and characters, public and pri|vate. Those are but shallow politics, which do not comprehend sound morals; and the consequences of the moral characters of men reach into the unseen world.</P>
<P>Long Prefaces are seldom acceptable to readers. I shall therefore beg leave to break off here for the present, and to leave before the impartial tribunal of the public my following labours, not doubting but they will be in general received with the candor, which their <HI>intention,</HI> more than their <HI>merit,</HI> may claim.</P>

<P>IF there be, in any region of the universe, an order of moral agents living in society, whose reason is strong, whose passions and inclinations are mo|derate, and whose dispositions are turned to virtue, to such an order of happy beings, legislation, adminis|tration, and police, with the endlessly various and complicated apparatus of politics, must be in a great measure superfluous. Did reason govern mankind, there would be little occasion for any other govern|ment, either monarchical, aristocratical, democra|tical, or mixed. But man, whom we dignify with the honourable title of <HI>Rational,</HI> being much more frequently influenced, in his proceedings, by suppos|ed interest, by passion, by sensual appetite, by ca|price, by any thing, by nothing, than by reason; it
<PB N="2" REF="013851_0032_0F9E2B91D9441038">
has, in all civilized ages and countries, been found proper to frame laws and statutes fortified by sanctions, and to establish orders of men invested with authority to execute those laws, and inflict the deserved punish|ments upon the violators of them. By such means only has it been found possible to preserve the general peace and tranquility. But, such is the perverse dis|position of man, the most unruly of all animals, that this most useful institution has been generally de|bauched into an engine of oppression and tyranny over those, whom it was expresly and solely establish|ed to defend. And to such a degree has this evil prevailed, that in almost every age and country, the <HI>government</HI> has been the principal <HI>grievance</HI> of the people, as appears too dreadfully manifest, from the bloody and deformed page of history. For what is general history, but a view of the abuses of power committed by those, who have got it into their hands, to the subjugation, and destruction of the human species, to the ruin of the general peace and happi|ness, and turning the Almighty's fair and good world into a butchery of its inhabitants, for the gratification of the unbounded ambition of a few, who, in over|throwing the felicity of their fellow-creatures, have confounded their own?</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> government only can be pronounced consistent with the design of all government, which allows to the governed the liberty of doing what, consistently with the <HI>general</HI> good, they may desire to do, and which only forbids their doing the contrary. Liberty does not exclude restraint; it only excludes unrea|sonable restraint. To determine precisely how far <HI>personal</HI> liberty is compatible with the <HI>general</HI> good, and of the propriety of social conduct in all cases, is a matter of great extent, and demands the united wisdom
<PB N="3" REF="013851_0033_0F9E2B929C1A9868">
of a whole people. And the <HI>consent</HI> of the whole <HI>people,</HI> as far as it can be obtained, is indispensably <HI>necessary</HI> to every law, by which the whole <HI>people</HI> are to be bound; else the whole people are enslaved to the <HI>one,</HI> or the <HI>few,</HI> who frame the laws for them.</P>
<P>Were a colony to emigrate from their native land, and settle in a new country, on what would they pro|pose to bestow their chief attention? On securing the happiness of the <HI>whole?</HI> or on the aggrandizement of the governor? If the latter, all mankind would pro|nounce those colonists void of common sense. But in every absolute monarchy, the aggrandizement of the governor is the supreme object; and the happiness of the <HI>people</HI> is to yield to it. Were only a handful of friends to form themselves into one of those little societies we call clubs; what would be their object? The advantage of the company, or the power of the chair-man?</P>
<P>Very shrewd was <HI>Rumbald</HI>'s saying in <HI>Charles</HI> II's. time, viz.

<P>ALL lawful authority, legislative, and executive, originates from the <HI>people.</HI> Power in the <HI>people</HI> is like light in the sun, native, original, inherent,

and unlimited by any thing human. In governors, it may be compared to the reflected light of the moon; for it is only borrowed, delegated, and limited by the intention of the people, whose it is, and to whom governors are to consider themselves as responsible, while the people are answerable only to God; them|selves being the losers, if they pursue a false scheme of politics. Of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>As the people are the fountain of power, so are they the object of government, in such manner, that where the people are safe, the ends of government are an|swered, and where the people are sufferers by their governors, those governors have failed of the main design of their institution, and it is of no importance what other ends they may have answered.</P>
<P>As the people are the fountain of power, and object of government, so are they the last resource, when governors betray their trust. And happy is that peo|ple, who have originally so principled their constitu|tion, that they themselves can without violence to it, lay hold of its power, wield it as they please, and turn it, when necessary, against those to whom it was entrusted, and who have exerted it to the prejudice of its original proprietors.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Government by Representation.</HEAD>
<P>GOVERNMENT naturally divides itself into legi|slative and executive. No degree of <HI>wisdom</HI> is more than sufficient for the former. For the latter, nothing but well regulated <HI>force</HI> is wanted. To compose a system of wise and good laws is the ut|most effort of human sagacity. To carry on the affairs of a nation, in a long-beaten track, requires only common sense and common diligence.</P>
<P>The most natural and simple idea of government is that of the people's assembling together in their <HI>own persons,</HI> for consulting, debating, enacting laws, and forming regulations, according to which all are to conduct themselves, and by which the general liberty, property and safety are provided for. Accordingly this is the plan of government among the Indians in <HI>America,</HI> and other simple and uncultivated people; and is described by <HI>Caesar, Tacitus,</HI> &amp;c. as having been that of the antient <HI>Gauls,</HI> and <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>But such a scheme of government is thought only compatible with a small dominion. In great and po|pulous countries, it being supposed impossible to as|semble together, in a deliberative capacity, the whole body of the people, or even all the men of property, so as to avoid confusion, and to obtain the uncon|strained opinion of a majority, it is thought necessary to have recourse to an adequate and freely elected <HI>representation.</HI></P>
<P>It may be said, <Q>Why might not (in <HI>Britain</HI> for instance) the inhabitants of single counties meet to|gether to deliberate on those subjects, which are now debated in parliament, and afterwards communicate
<PB N="6" REF="013851_0036_0F9E2B94CF36DDF0">
the result of their consultation to a grand national assembly?</Q> The answer is, This would still be go|vernment by representation; because the national assembly must be the elected representatives of the people. Of all which more hereafter.</P>
<P>In planning a government by representation, the people ought to provide against their own <HI>annihilation.</HI> They ought to establish a regular and constitutional method of acting by and from <HI>themselves,</HI> without, or even in opposition to their <HI>representatives,</HI> if necessary. Our ancestors therefore were provident; but not provident enough. They set up parliaments, as a curb on <HI>kings</HI> and <HI>ministers</HI>; but they neglected to re|serve to themselves a regular and constitutional method of exerting their power in curbing <HI>parliaments,</HI> when necessary. Of which I shall have occasion to treat more fully in the sequel.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Advantages of parliamentary Government, which have recommended it to many nations.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no advantage within the reach of a particular people, that may not be obtained by parliamentary goverment in as effectual a manner, as if every inhabitant of the country were to deliberate and vote in person. But this supposes par|liament free from all indirect influence, and to have no interest separate from the general good of the commonwealth.</P>
<P>In a country, like <HI>Britain,</HI> where a parliament is constitutionally the last resort, and where there lies no regular appeal to the <HI>people,</HI> the perversion of parlia|ment from its original intention may prove utter ruin,
<PB N="7" REF="013851_0037_0F9E2B958D894948">
as leaving no constitutional means of redress, and compelling the people to take into their own hands the dangerous work of vindicating their liberties by force; which, in the concusion of jarring parties, may produce anarchy and end in tyranny. Of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>Nothing can be imagined more august than a nu|merous set of wise, free, and honest men sitting in consultation upon the means for securing the happiness of a whole people. Such was that most venerable antient assembly of the <HI>Amphictyons,</HI> which was the general tribunal of <HI>Greece</HI> for judging and deciding all controversies among the several states. So great was the respect in which the decisions of that council were held, that their sentences were seldom, or never, disputed, and that grievous wars were often termina|ted by their arbitration. The several states of <HI>Greece,</HI> in number about twelve, sent each to this grand court one, two, or three delegates, according to their respective importance <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ubb.</HI> EMM. II.277.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Panaetolium</HI> of the antient <HI>Aetolians</HI> seems to have been an assembly very much upon the plan of our house of commons. This convention met annually, or oftner, if necessity required. Representatives were sent to this assembly from all quarters, with instruc|tions, from which they were not to deviate. In this <HI>Panaetolium</HI> resided the whole majesty of the state. In it laws were made and repealed, alliances formed and renounced, peace and war declared, magistrates ap|pointed, particularly the chief commander, for every year, &amp;c <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. II.251.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The antient <HI>Achaia</HI> was a confederacy of states, like our modern <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Swisserland</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. II.228.</NOTE>. Each of those
<PB N="8" REF="013851_0038_0F9E2B97C809E838">
little states had its possessions, territories, and boun|daries; each had its senate, or assembly, its magistrates and judges; and every state sent deputies to the gene|ral convention, and had equal weight in all determi|nations <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ubb.</HI> EMM. II.230.</NOTE>. And most of the neighbouring states, which, moved by fear of danger, acceded to this confederacy, had reason to felicitate themselves.</P>
<P>The government of the antient commonwealths of <HI>Italy,</HI> before the <HI>Roman</HI> was formed, was much upon a free or parliamentary plan.</P>
<P>The <HI>Israelitish</HI> government was of the free, or par|liamentary kind. The people's demanding a change of the form of their government into monarchical, was directly opposite to their constitution, and to the divine intention. Which, by the bye, shews the absurdity of the doctrine of regal government's being of divine original. Of which more elsewhere.</P>
<P>The republic of <HI>Lycia</HI> was a confederacy of towns, which they ranged into three classes according to their respective importance. To the cities of the first rank they allowed three votes each in the general council; to those of the second two, and to those of the third one.
<Q>For reason taught them, that they, who have the most at stake, ought to have the greatest weight in all consultations concerning the common good <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. II.300.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sparta,</HI> as modelled by the good and wise <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> was a republican, or parliamentary government, though of a mixed kind; for there were kings, a senate elected by the people, and an assembly of the people, the consent of which last was necessary to the establishment of a law, says <HI>Plutarch</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">VIT. LYCURG. sub init.</NOTE>. Nor
<PB N="9" REF="013851_0039_0F9E2B97D22E6B40">
Nor was this mixture an objection against the <HI>Spar|tan</HI> government's being of the free, or parliamentary kind. The <HI>Theban,</HI> the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the <HI>English,</HI> and other free, or parliamentary governments have all been of the mixed sort, having admitted kings, or stadtholders, or other chiefs. There has indeed hardly ever been known a pure commonwealth; though many an unmixed monarchy, or tyranny. The <HI>Eng|lish</HI> republic, which was demolished by the villainous <HI>Cromwel,</HI> was one of the most unmixed, that ever was known. It was a true government by repre|sentation; of which more hereafter. In the mean while, now I am mentioning republican govern|ment, I take this opportunity of entering an express caveat against all accusations of a desire to establish republican principles. I do not think a friend to this nation is obliged to promote a change in the consti|tution. The present form of government by king, lords, and commons, if it could be restored to its true spirit and efficiency, might be made to yield all the liberty, and all the happiness, of which a great and good people are capable in this world. There|fore I do not think it worth while to hazard any con|siderable commotion for the sake merely of changing the constitution from limited monarchy to republi|can government, though I hardly know the risque it would not be worth while to run for the sake of changing our government from <HI>corrupt</HI> to <HI>incorrupt.</HI> But to return.</P>
<P><HI>Athens,</HI> as reformed by <HI>Solon,</HI> was a free, or parli|amentary state, consisting of a senate of 400 elect|ed by the people, besides the court of <HI>Areopagus.</HI> The poorest of the people had a right of speaking

and voting in the assembly of the people, or, if you please, house of commons. The people indeed pos|sessed, by this means, a degree of power above the reach of such as the vulgar were in those antient un|improved ages, before the art of printing had made knowledge universal as in our times. The errors in the <HI>Athenian</HI> state were in the first concoction. Had <HI>Solon</HI> been concerned in the original framing of it, that state would have been longer-lived. He con|fessed, that all he could do was, To give the <HI>Athe|nians</HI> the best laws their degeneracy could bear <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plut.</HI> VIT. SOLON.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Athens</HI> consisted, says <HI>Harrington</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">OCEANA, 51.</NOTE>, of the senate of the bean proposing, of the church or assembly of the people resolving, and too often debating, which was the ruin of it; as also of the senate of the <HI>Areo|pagites,</HI> the 9 <HI>archons,</HI> with divers other magistrates, executing. <HI>Lacedaemon</HI> consisted of the senate pro|posing, of the church or congregation of the people resolving only, and never debating, which was the long life of it; and of the two kings, the court of the <HI>ephori,</HI> with diverse other magistrates, executing. <HI>Carthage</HI> consisted of the senate proposing, and some|times resolving; of the people resolving, and some|times debating too; for which fault she was repre|hended by <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and she had her <HI>suffetes,</HI> and her hundred men, with other magistrates, executing. <HI>Rome</HI> consisted of the senate proposing, the <HI>concio</HI> or people resolving, and too oftent debating, which caused her storms; as also of the consuls, censors, aediles, tribunes, praetors, quaestors, and other magi|strates, executing. <HI>Venice</HI> consists of the senate or

The proceeding of the commonwealths of <HI>Switzerland</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> is of a like nature, though after a more obscure manner: for the soverainties, whether cantons, provinces, or cities, which are the people, send their deputies commissioned and instructed by themselves (wherein they reserve the result in their own power) to the provincial or general conven|tion or senate, when the deputies debate, but have no other power of result than what was conferred upon them by the people, or is farther conferred by the same upon farther occasion. And for the execu|tive part they have magistrates or judges in every can|ton, province, or city, besides those which are more public and relate to the league, as for adjusting con|troversies between one canton, province, or city, and another; or the like between such persons as are not of the same canton, province, or city.</Q></P>

<P><HI>Carthage</HI> was undoubtedly a free, or parliamen|tary state, without a king; though I do not know, that we have a particular account of its constitution

from any antient author, <HI>Greek,</HI> or <HI>Latin</HI>; for of the country itself we have not so much as the name of a writer. We read of their having a senate, and of a fatal division among the people by the <HI>Hannonian</HI> fac|tion, which ruined <HI>Hannibal</HI>'s schemes, and prevented his making a total conquest of <HI>Rome</HI> after the battle of <HI>Cannae</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Roman</HI> Historians of that period.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> government down to <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> was parliamentary. Their senate may be compared to our house of peers, as the senators sat for life, and in their own right. And though the <HI>Romans</HI> had nothing of representation comparable to our house of com|mons, supposing our house of commons incorrupt and independent; yet representation, or giving the people their weight in government, was what they intended by their tribunes of the people, and by di|viding the people into <HI>curiae, comitia,</HI> tribes, &amp;c. The <HI>Roman</HI> republic was but half-formed, and the formed part was the least valuable. We read often of the tribunes sending the consuls to prison; and, we find the senate depriving the tribunes of their office <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">ANT. UNIV. HIST. XIII. p. 143.</NOTE>. This shews the <HI>Roman</HI> republic to have been miserably ill-balanced, when the senate was sometimes above the tribunes, and the tribunes sometimes above the consuls. <HI>Romulus</HI> had originally divided the people into three tribes, and each of these into ten <HI>curiae.</HI> He chose one senator himself, and ordered each of the tribes, and <HI>curiae</HI> to chuse three, which amounted to 100 in all. None but patricians could be senators. Thus 99 of the 100 senators owed their seats to the people. When the 100 <HI>Sabines</HI> were added, they were all patri|cians,
<PB N="13" REF="013851_0043_0F9E2B9ADC39A1B8">
and all chosen by the people. When <HI>Tarquinius Priscus,</HI> to ingratiate himself with the people at his accession, chose 100 senators out of their body; he enobled them first&punc; The number of the senators pro|bably continued to be about 300 till the time of <HI>Sylla,</HI> 530 years from <HI>Tarquinius Priscus. Sylla</HI> probably increased the number (by bringing in men for his pur|pose, to above 400. But these additional senators were still chosen by the people. <HI>Caesar,</HI> to strenthen his party, increased the senate to 900, introducing all sorts of men, as new-made citizens, half barbarous <HI>Gauls,</HI> soldiers, and sons of freed-men. It would be a ridiculous to think of the people's having any hand in this transaction. For in <HI>Caesar</HI>'s time the army ruled all. And lastly the triumvirs increased the senate to above 1000. In the imperial times it is of no consequence what the number of the senate was; because all power was then engrossed by the emperors, and the senate was an empty name; that mighty senate, of which <HI>Cineas Pyrrhus</HI>'s embassador, said, it seemed to him an assembly of kings; that senate, which was for ages the scourge of tyrants, was then become a mere <HI>ergastulum</HI> of slaves, the drudges, the flatterers, and supporters of tyrants.</P>
<P>After <HI>Coriolianus</HI>'s time, <HI>A. U. C.</HI> 263, the plebei|ans became eligible, without being ennobled, into the senate. And those magistrates, who were called <HI>curule,</HI> had the privilege, during a certain time, of giving their votes in the senate, though they were not senators.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> senators voted either by a general Aye or No, sitting in their places, or by separately declar|ing each his <HI>sententia,</HI> as the <HI>censors</HI> called their names; or by dividing, those for the question going to one side

<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> republic was indeed never finished. For the caprice of the multitude was left to operate at random. So that every popular demagogue had it in his power to spirit up the multitude to whatever pitch of madness might suit his ambitious, or interested views. Nor was the general sense of the <HI>Roman</HI> people known by the fluctuating violence of the mob of the capital, who were often deceived, and often influenced, by largesses of corn, or by shews of gladiators; but who had more weight in the government, than the consuls, senate, and all the citizens of <HI>Italy</HI> and the other <HI>Ro|man</HI> dominions. The error consisted in the want of a regular subdivision, and representation of the people. The body of the people of property ought to have in their own hands the government of themselves. But the multitude in one great and debauched city ought not to be considered as the body of the people. The tribunitial power was too great. The appeals to the people at large, and their voting at large, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> what first opened a door for the contests of <HI>Sylla</HI> and <HI>Marini,</HI> and of <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Pompey,</HI> which overset liberty.</P>
<P>The great error in the <HI>Roman</HI> republic was, That the people, or plebeians were not represented, but voted in a collective body; which occasioned conti|nual tumult and confusion. They assembled in innu|merable multitudes, and forced their tribunes upon
<PB N="15" REF="013851_0045_0F9E2B9C54C9DA88">

<P>The power of the <HI>French</HI> kings was antiently re|strained within very narrow limits. Liberty was the same in <HI>France,</HI> as in all the <HI>Gothic</HI> states.

All the great officers of state took their oaths in par|liament; not bound personally to the king, but in his political capacity. Laws had no force, unless they regestered them. The efficiency of all those checks is now lost. No assembly of the states now heard of. Parliaments are only the shadow of what they were. Their tyrant has the liberties of the subject entirely at his mercy; imprisons whom he pleases; sets up what judges he pleases, to try whom he pleases, and con|vict them of what crime he pleases. The great officers take the oaths to him, and are responsible to him, and not at all, as formerly, to the people.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Parliaments irregular and deficient, <HI>1,</HI> By Establish|ment. <HI>2,</HI> By Abuse. By Establishment they are an inadequate Representation of the People, and their Period is too long. By Abuse they are corrupt.</HEAD>
<P>PARLIAMENTS in <HI>England</HI> have been of very fluctuating importance in different ages. It was long before they got to what might be called a bearing&punc; And even now, there is in them infinitely more wrong than right, as will too mani|festly appear by what follows.</P>
<P>Parliaments are irregular and deficient, 1, by esta|blishment; and 2, by abuse. When I distinguish between the irregularities and deficiencies in our par|liaments by establishment, and by abuse, I mean by the former such irregularities and deficiencies&punc; as are known and avowed, as their too great length, their being an inadequate representation, &amp;c. By the lat|ter, I mean those which have insensibly crept in, and prevail through connivance, as corruption at elections, and in the house, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is justly remarked by Mr. <HI>Hume,</HI> That whatever, in government, is publicly allowed at any particular
<PB N="23" REF="013851_0053_0F9E2BA3D38D2850">
period, may be said to be constitutional at that period, especially (it may be added) if it has been regu|larly and openly introduced and established by appro|bation of the majority of those, who have the power of establishing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc;</P>
<P>The lengthening of parliaments from annual to triennial, and from triennial to septennial, is undoubt|edly an <HI>abuse</HI> (of which more hereafter) but being avowedly effected at first, and allowed since, this abuse becomes constitutional.</P>
<P>But the buying of boroughs, and of votes in the house of commons, was never fairly established, nor openly avowed as a regular proceeding, and is there|fore a mere abuse, and not a constitutional error.</P>
<P>Almost all political establishments have been the creatur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of chance rather than of wisdom. There are few instances of a people forming for themselves a constitution from the foundation. Therefore it is impossible to say what would be the effect of a perfect commonwealth; there being no example of such a phaenomenon. The common course of those matters has been, that either a people have emigrated from an old established government, and have wrought into their new system of politics the errors and deficiencies, which had crept into the old; or a few wise and good men have undertaken to repair and patch up a crazy constitution; and then, like <HI>Solon,</HI> they found them|selves obliged to be content with as good a consti|tion as the people would bear, instead of such an one as a wise legislator could frame. And in establishing this constitution, they have been obliged to yield to the violence of party, and the blindness of prejudice, and to suffer various particulars to be established con|trary to their own better judgment. So that the
<PB N="24" REF="013851_0054_0F9E2BA493EB4DE0">
machine of government being pushed one way by one party, and the contrary by another, is at last pushed into a bog, or set on the edge of a precipice, and left out of the perpendicular, like the hanging tower of <HI>Pisa,</HI> to be propped and shored up by posterity. This is in part the case of our own constitution, especi|ally with respect to the <HI>commons</HI> house of parliament. If there be in a ship at sea ten leaks, to stop nine of them will not put the crew in a state of safety; though they must perhaps be stopped one after another, they must <HI>all</HI> be stopped, else the consequence is obvious;

There are several frightful leaks in the great vessel of the <HI>British</HI> state, which, if they be not <HI>all</HI> stopped, must sink it.</P>
<P>The grievances requiring redress, which respect parliament, are chiefly these: 1. By establishment they are in no respect a representation of the property of the people. 2. Their period is, likewise by esta|blishment, of an enormous length. 3. They are, by abuse, corrupt, or fallen under an undue influence both as to the election of members, and their voting in the house.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Inadequate Representation, its Disadvantages.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN our ancestors first proposed govern|ment by representation, it is certain, they intended <HI>adequate</HI> representation; for no other deserves the name, or answers the end.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="013851_0055_0F9E2BA5543FE620">
<Q>Every <HI>Englishman</HI> (says Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">COM. WEALTH OF ENG. 37.</NOTE>) is intended to be present in parliament, either in person, or by procuration and attorney, of what preeminence, state, dignity, or quality soever he be, from the prince to the lowest person of <HI>England.</HI> And the consent of the parliament is taken to be every man's consent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In a free state (says judge <HI>Blackstone</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blackst.</HI> COMM. I.158.</NOTE>) every man, who is supposed a free agent' (that is, not through poverty, absolutely dependent on the will of another) ought to be, in some measure, his own governor, and therefore a branch, at least, of the legislative power ought to reside in the whole body of the people.</Q></P>
<P>It is evident, that inadequate representation in par|liament is utterly inconsistent with the idea of <HI>free</HI> government. For a people governed contrary to their inclination, or by persons, to whom they have given no commission for that purpose, are, in the properest sense of the phrase, <HI>an enslaved people,</HI> if ever there was an enslaved people.</P>
<P><Q>Il est essentiel de fixer, <HI>&amp;c. It is necessary</HI></Q>
(says the excellent <HI>Montesquieu</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Montesq.</HI> L' ESPR. DES. LOIX. I.13.</NOTE>)
<Q>to fix the number of citi|zens who are to vote; otherwise it is uncertain whether the people, or only a part of the people, have given their sense.</Q>
(We know full well, that it is but a very small part of the people of <HI>England</HI> whose votes fill the house of representatives, and that the votes of both electors and members are most barefacedly influenced.) <Q>At <HI>Sparta,</HI> the sense of the people was collected from a suffrage of 10,000. At <HI>Rome,</HI> this
<PB N="26" REF="013851_0056_0F9E2BA617FFF390">
was neglected; which was one great cause of its ruin.</Q></P>
<P>To compare great things with small, could the <HI>East India</HI> company be said to be established on a proper foot, if 100 proprietors, whose stock amount|ed in all to 5,000<HI>l.</HI> had the power of chusing the court of directors against the votes of 5000 proprietors, whose stock was worth 5,000,000<HI>l,</HI> and if the court of directors, when chosen, possessed absolute power without a peal, and thought them|selves responsible to no set of men upon earth? Or if a friendly society consisting of 100 members found that the whole power of the society was en|grossed by 3 members; and that the others could obtain nothing they wanted, or in the manner they wished to have it; could this society be, with any shadow of propriety, called free? That parliamen|tary representation on its present foot, is as incon|sistent with liberty, will appear but too clearly in the sequel.</P>
<P>That a <HI>part</HI> of the people, a <HI>small</HI> part of the peo|ple, and the most needy and <HI>dependent</HI> part of the people, should engross the power of electing legisla|tors, and deprive the majority, and the independent part of the people of their right, which is, to chuse legislators for themselves and the minority and depen|dent part of the people, is the grossest injustice that can be imagined.</P>
<P>Every government, to have a reasonable expec|tation of permanency, ought to be founded in <HI>truth, iustice,</HI> and the <HI>reason</HI> of things. Our admirable con|stitution, the envy of <HI>Europe,</HI> is founded in <HI>injustice.</HI> Eight hundred individuals rule all, themselves accoun|table to none. Of these about 300 are <HI>born</HI> rulers,
<PB N="27" REF="013851_0057_0F9E2BA6DBDB60D0">
whether qualified or not. Of the others, a great many are <HI>said</HI> to be elected by a handful of beggars instead of the number and property, who have the right to be the electors. And of these pretended electors, the greatest part are <HI>obliged</HI> to chuse the person nominated by some lord, or by the minister. Instead of the power's returning annually into the hands of the people, or, to speak properly of the boroughs, the lengthening of parliament to septen|nial, has deprived them of six parts in seven of their power; and if the power returned annually, as it ought, <HI>all the people</HI> would still have reason to com|plain, but the <HI>handful,</HI> who vote the members into the house.</P>
<P>In consequence of the inadequate state of represen|tation, the sense of the people may be grosly mis|apprehended, or misrepresented, and it may turn out to be of very little consequence, that members were willing to obey the instructions of their constiuents; because that would not be obeying the general sense of the people. For the people are not their consti|tuents. The people of <HI>England</HI> are the innumerable multitude which fills, like one continued city, a great part of <HI>Middlesex, Kent</HI> and <HI>Surry</HI>; the countless inhabitants of the vast ridings of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> the mul|titudes, who swarm in the cities and great towns of <HI>Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Ely,</HI> and others; some of which places have no repre|sentatives at all, and the rest are unequally repre|sented. These places comprehend the greatest part of the people. Whereas the instructions would be sent from the hungry boroughs of <HI>Cornwal, Devon|shire,</HI> &amp;c. In short, the sense of the constituents would be, at best, only the sense of a few thou|sands; whereas it ought to be that of several hun|dreds
<PB N="28" REF="013851_0058_0F9E2BA79D4FCCA8">
of thousands, as will be very clearly made out by and by.</P>
<P><Q>Neither in <HI>Scotland</HI> nor <HI>England</HI> (says <HI>Rapin</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rapin,</HI> II.583.</NOTE>) are are resolutions of parliament to be always considered as the sense of the nation. It is a defect of the constitution of both houses, that the members of parliament receive no instructions from their electors. The moment they are met, they become masters and sovereigns of those by whom they are chosen, and palm upon the nation their own decisions for those of the public, though they are often contrary to the sentiments and interests of the people they represent. Instances are so frequent, that I need not stay to prove what I advance.</Q>
<Q>It must not be imagined (says he <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. II.9.</NOTE>) that then,</Q>
(in the times of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.)
<Q>any more than at this day, whatever the parliament did was agreeable to the general opinion of the nation. The representative was chosen as at present, without any instruction con|cerning the points to be debated in parliament, nay without the people's knowing any thing of them. Thus the house of commons had, as I may say, an unlimited power to determine by a majority of votes, with the concurrence of the lords and assent of the king, what they deemed proper for the welfare of the kingdom.</Q>
[In our times (the present always ex|cepted) what they deem proper for the welfare of the junto.]
<Q>There was no necessity therefore, in order to obtain what the court desired, of having the con|sent of the people, but only the majority of voices in both houses. Hence it is easy to conceive, that the court used all imaginable means to cause such mem|bers to be elected, as were in their sentiments.
<PB N="29" REF="013851_0059_0F9E2BAAA7D520D8">
This is now, and ever will be practised, till some cure is found for this inconvenience. I call it an in|convenience, because it happens sometimes that the parliament passes acts contrary to the general opinion of the nation.</Q></P>
<P>Under a whig ministry (says the same author <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rapin,</HI> II.806.</NOTE>) we see a whig parliament chosen, under a tory ministry a tory parliament.
<Q>It has frequently happened, that the resolutions of the lower house have been directly con|trary to the sentiments of the people, whom they represented. So it is not the people, or commons of <HI>England</HI> that share the legislative power with the king and peers; but the representatives, who enjoy a pri|vilege, which belongs only to the people in gene|ral, to whom however they are not accountable for their conduct. All they can suffer, if they have acted in parliament contrary to the sense of their county, or borough, is not to be elected again <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Parliament under <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. confirmed the de|molition of the papal power over <HI>England,</HI> and the dissolution of the religious houses; under <HI>Edward</HI> VI. demolished popery; under <HI>Mary,</HI> set it up again; under <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> overthrew it a second time. So we have seen parliament stamp the <HI>Americans,</HI> then un|stamp them, and then tax them in a new manner. Parliament has not, in these sudden doings and un|doings, followed the sense of the people. The un|steady people are not so unsteady as this comes to. In former times, parliament was too much overawed by the authority of <HI>kings:</HI> in latter times, too much swayed by <HI>ministerial</HI> influence; and all this in con|sequence of its being in no respect a just and accoun|table representative of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="013851_0060_0F9E2BAC041F6798">

(says Mr. <HI>Cornwal</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. II.192.</NOTE>, in the house, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1685.)
<Q>the complexion of this house might have been depended on as a true representa|tion of the inclinations of the <HI>people</HI>; but by what|ever magic art it has been brought about, the case is now directly contrary. The complexion of this assembly is always the same with that of our <HI>mini|sters.</HI> We adopt all their measures. We applaud every step of their conduct. We are angry with those they happen to be angry with. We enquire when they set us on; and we stop when they say, You have gone far enough. Sir, we have had for many years past a course of most excellent ministers, or this house has by some magic art been rendered blind to their failings. I say some magic art, for if by any art we have been rendered remiss in our duty, it must have been by some art of the Devil permitted by God Almighty for the punishment of our sins; and if so, I hope he will dispell the enchantment, before we have blindly run ourselves into irrecovera|ble perdition.</Q></P>
<P>The nation in general disapproved of the proceed|ings of the tory commons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1701, and the justices of peace, grand jury, freeholders, &amp;c. of <HI>Kent</HI> presented a petition, lamenting the divisions in the kingdom, and the reflexions cast upon the king (by the commons) recommending union, attention to the sense of the people, supplies, &amp;c. The house votes it scandalous, insolent, seditious, tending to destroy the constitution of parliament, and to subvert the established government of these realms. They ordered the gentlemen, who presented it, to be taken
<PB N="31" REF="013851_0061_0F9E2BAC1EF28FC8">
into custody. One escaped. It was apprehended that force would be used to rescue the others. The house orders them to the gatehouse, and addresses the king to issue his proclamation for apprehending <HI>Colepepper</HI> again, and for putting out of the commission of the peace and lieutenancy such of the petitioners as were in them. Then the legion letter was sent to the speaker, which begun thus,
<Q>Gentlemen, it were to be wished you were men of that temper, and pos|sessed of so much honour, as to bear with the truth, though it be against you, especially from us, who have so much right to tell it to you: But since even petitions to you from your masters (for such are the people who chuse you (are so haughtily received as with the committing the authors to ille|gal custody; you must give us leave to give you this fair notice of your misbehaviour.

condemned the petition itself, and resolved, that to assert, that the house of commons is not the only representative of the commons of <HI>England,</HI> or that the commons have no power of commitment&punc; but over their own members, or to reflect on the proceedings of the house, or of any member in the house, are high violations of the privileges of the house of com|mons <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tind.</HI> CONTIN.

<P>Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> in her answer to the parliament's address, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1714, says, She esteems the address and approbation of the peace of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> the undoubted voice of her <HI>people</HI>&middot; But the lords in their first address to <HI>George</HI> I. say,
<Q>It was by no means to be imputed to the <HI>nation</HI> in general.</Q>
And the commons in less than a year afterwards, said,
<Q>As that dishonour cannot in justice be imputed to the whole <HI>nation,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
All this shews that a parliament may have one interest, and the nation another. This could not be, if par|liaments were really what it is pretended they are <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. II.356.</NOTE>.</P>

<Q>was approved of by a majority in both houses of parliament. I remem|ber, I then disapproved of it, and gave my senti|ments very freely in this house against it; and I remember the reward I met with for so doing. That very treaty was in a following parliament, so highly disapproved of, that some of those who had the chief hand in making it, were punished by parliament; and others had perhaps been more severely punished if they had not fled from justice. This my lords, may perhaps be the fate of the convention in some

future parliament, though the father of it seems now extremely fond of his child: for I cannot but look upon his majesty's speech and the address now pro|posed as a second approbation of that convention. I must think them designed as a new triumph over those that opposed it, which can give no great joy to the nation, whatever it may do to the father of the convention; and therefore I wish that in order to make his country rejoice as well as himself, he would hereafter take as much care to triumph over those that oppose it.</Q></P>
<P>When the bill for searching houses in quest of sailors was before the commons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1739, it was found to be very unpopular, and the people of <HI>Gloces|tershire</HI> petitioned against it in a very high style,
<Q>That it would, as the petitioners apprehend, impose hardships upon the people too heavy to be borne, and excite discontents in the minds of his majesty's sub|jects; would subvert all the rights and privileges of a <HI>Briton,</HI> and overturn <HI>Magna Charta</HI> itself, the basis on which they are built; and by these means destroy that very liberty, for the preservation of which the present royal family was established upon the throne of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; for which reasons such a law could never be obeyed, or much blood would be shed in consequence of it.</Q>
The house took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch offence at this petition, that they voted, 196 to 144, it should not lie upon their table <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, VI.289.</NOTE>.</P>

<Q>The misfortune is, that gentlemen who are in office, seldom converse with any but such as are in office, and such men, let them think what they will,
<PB N="34" REF="013851_0064_0F9E2BAF1FAC7988">
always applaud the conduct of their superiors; con|sequently, gentlemen who are in the administration, or in any office under it, can rarely know what is the voice of the people. The voice of this house was formerly, I shall grant, and always ought to be the voice of the people. If new parliaments were more frequent, and few placemen and no pensioners admitted, it would be so still; but if long parliaments be continued, and a corrupt influence should pre|vail, not only at elections, but in this house, the voice of the house will generally be very different, nay often directly contrary to the voice of the people<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

So that gentlemen thought 30 years ago, and to the same purpose, a few years since, on the stamp-act, he charged the house of commons with an unli|mited compliance with the demands of the ministry.</P>
<P>In the case of <HI>Ashby</HI> and <HI>White,</HI> the resolutions of the commons were directly contrary to the sense of the people. The people's universal opinion was, that the commons took too much upon them; and that any person may, and ought to appeal to the courts of justice and the law of the land, when he thinks him|self deprived of his right as an elector; the resolu|tions of a house of commons being unsteady and vague, while the law of the land is notorious and per|manent. Of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>We have, in our own times, seen a most remark|able instance of disagreement between the sense of the people, and that of parliament. We have seen par|liament repeatedly expel Mr. <HI>Wilkes.</HI> And we have seen the people so highly offended at this proceeding,
<PB N="35" REF="013851_0065_0F9E2BAFD1AD3CF0">
that 60,000 of them have petitioned the king to dissolve this parliament. In consequence of which numerous petitions, it was to be expected, that some notice would be taken in the king's, that is the minister's speech, next ensuing. Instead of which (so low, is the people's im|portance sunk, and so little regard shewn to their opi|nion) the laughter of all <HI>Europe</HI> was excited by a few frivolous paragraphs about a pretended sickness among the horned cattle, of which no body had heard any thing before as then existing in <HI>England,</HI> nor has any one since. It was moved in the house of commons, that, in their address, in answer to the above profound speech, the house should declare their intention of enquiring into the causes of the present discontents. Several of the courtly members gravely denied that there was any discontent in the kingdom, though they knew that 60,000 had subscribed petitions for a dissolution of parliament. They might have argued more plausibly, that there was no parliament then existing. For it will appear presently, that a tenth part of the above number sends in the majority of the house. And if the voluntary petition of 60,000 deserves no regard, surely the bought votes of 5000 ought to go for nothing. Others of the opposers of the motion said, The affair did not come regularly before them; as if they had declared, that the house of commons, the grand inquest of the nation, the representatives of the people of <HI>England,</HI> are not obliged to enquire into a matter of such consequence in the opinion of the people, that 60,000 of them had thought it necessary to complain to the sovereign; or as if they so wholly disregarded the opinion of ten times the number of the electors of the majority of their house, concerning their own conduct, that they did not think it worth while to enquire what
<PB N="36" REF="013851_0066_0F9E2BB08E454E18">
had so grievously offended so great a number of their constituents, as to provoke them to the unusual mea|sure of petitioning the king for their dissolution.

<P>FIVE millions, according to the estimate of my incomparable friend Dr. <HI>Price,</HI> and our best modern calculators, is nearest to the true num|ber of the people of <HI>England.</HI> The males between 6 and 56 in 5 millions are 1,250,000, or a fourth part of the whole. As youth at 16 are of an age too im|mature to be capable of voting, so are many on the contrary capable of voting beyond the age of 56; and one may be supposed to make up for the other. It is commonly insisted on, that persons in servitude to others, and those who receive alms, ought not to be admitted to vote for members of parliament, because it is supposed, that their votes will be influenced by those, on whom they depend.</P>
<P>But the objection from influence would fall to the ground, if the state were on a right foot, and parlia|ment

free from court-influence. Supposing half the constitution in disorder, it is not easy to determine what would be best for the other half. My purpose is, to point out <HI>all</HI> the defects. And if the people will correct all I shall point out, I will then answer, that all shall go well; but not if they amend by <HI>halves.</HI>&mdash;To return,&mdash;</P>
<P>Every man has what may be called property, and unalienable property. Every man has a life, a per|sonal liberty, a character, a right to his earnings, a right to a religious profession and worship according to his conscience, &amp;c. and many men, who are in a state of dependence upon others, and who receive charity, have wives and children, in whom they have a right. Thus the poor are in danger of being in|jured by the government in a variety of ways. But, according to the commonly received doctrine, that servants, and those who receive alms, have no right to vote for members of parliament, an immense mul|titude of the people are utterly deprived of all power in determining who shall be the protectors of their lives, their personal liberty, their little property (which though singly considered is of small value, yet is upon the whole a very great object) and the chastity of their wives and daughters, &amp;c. What is particularly hard upon the poor in this case is, that though they have no sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in determining who shall be the lawgivers of their country, they have a very heavy share in raising the taxes which support government. The taxes on malt, beer, leather, soap, candles, and other articles, which are paid chiefly by the poor, who are allowed <HI>no votes</HI> for members of parliament, amount to as much as a heavy land-tax. The landed interest would com|plain grievously, if they had no power of electing re|presentatives. And it is an established maxim in free
<PB N="38" REF="013851_0068_0F9E2BB20F1C4D28">
states, that whoever contributes to the expences of go|vernment ought to be satisfied concerning the applica|tion of the money contributed by them; consequently ought to have a share in electing those, who have the power of applying their money. Nor has the receiv|ing of alms been always held a sufficient reason for refusing the privilege of voting, as appears by the following; <Q>Resolved, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1690, That the free men of the port of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> inhabiting within the said borough, (although they receive <HI>alms</HI>) have a right to vote in electing barons to serve in parliament.</Q> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bohun</HI>'s RIGHT OF ELECT. p. 257. from the JOURNAL OF THE HOUSE OF COM.</NOTE> Query, Whether there be not other instances of per|sons receiving alms, having a right to vote for mem|bers.</P>
<P>But, giving up the point, concerning the right of the poor to vote for members of parliament, the pre|sent state of parliamentary representation will still ap|pear to be inadequate beyond all proportion. Of the 1,250,000, the whole number of males in <HI>England,</HI> we may well suppose that at least one third, or about 416,000 are housekeepers, and independent on alms Divide this number by 513, the number of members for <HI>England,</HI> the quotient is 799 and a fraction, the round number is 800, which shews, that no member of parliament ought to carry his election against a compe|titor by fewer than 401 votes, that being a majority of 800, who have the right of voting, exclusive of the poor and dependent. If we allow <HI>them</HI> the privilege of chusing representatives, which I see no argument against, the number will be much greater, viz. about 1200, a majority of which is 601.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="013851_0069_0F9E2BB586B6CFA0">Mr. <HI>Postlethwayte</HI> reckons 639,000 taxable persons in <HI>England,</HI> excluding <HI>Wales</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">BRIT. TRUE SYST. 313.</NOTE>. And every person, who pays tax, ought to have a vote. Calculators did formerly reckon above 6,000,000 of souls in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales.</HI> And Dr. <HI>Price</HI> shews, that there is great reason to apprehend (with much concern I write it) that
<Q>we have lost a fourth part of our people.</Q>
Supposing <HI>Postlethwayte</HI>'s number of taxable persons in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> together to be 630,000; divid|ing this number by 513 shews, that no member ought to be voted into the house by fewer than the majority of 1200; for 1200 have a right, and 601 ought to be the smallest number of votes actually given to him who gains his election against a competitor. Or if we calculate by counties, the present state of representation will appear enormously absurd. The most adequate plan for forming an assembly of repre|sentatives, would be, for every county, including the cities, boroughs, cinque ports, or universities it hap|pens to contain, to send in a proportion of the 513 answering to its contribution to the public expence. Were that the plan, we should, in the same manner, see no member sent into the house by fewer than seve|ral hundreds of voters. Of which hereafter.</P>

<P>From this extract we see, that 254 members are actu|ally elected by 5723 votes; now the most numerous meeting of the commons ever known, was on occasion of the debate about <HI>Walpole, A. D.</HI> 1741. There were then 502 in the house. Therefore 254 comes very near a majority of the house, or the <HI>whole acting</HI> and <HI>efficient</HI> number. And the greatest part of these illus|trious,
<PB N="46" REF="013851_0076_0F9E2BBC17259538">
5723, who have the power of constituting lawgivers over the property of the nation, are them|selves persons of no property.</P>
<P>In <HI>North Britain</HI> the number of souls is about 1,5000,000. The males between 16 and 56 are 300,000. Allowing one third part to be their ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> masters, and to be above receiving charity, no <HI>Scotch</HI> member ought to be elected by fewer than a majority of 2000 votes. But there are many instances of mem|bers elected in <HI>North Britain</HI> by almost as small a number as in <HI>England.</HI> The truth of the matter is, that in <HI>North Britain,</HI> though the country be nothing as to riches, compared with <HI>England,</HI> yet there are fewer beggars. Almost all are housekeepers, though a great number of those houses are wretched hovels. So that almost all adult males ought to be voters in <HI>North Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Talbot</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, VI.345.</NOTE>, in his speech in the house of peers, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1739, supposes, that 50,000 elect the majo|rity of the house. And he justly exclaims against that number, as utterly disproportionate, which it undoubt|edly is, if the due number be 416,000 or 639,000. What would his lordship have said, had he known that little more than a tenth part of his 50,000 send in the majority of our law-makers?</P>
<P>Taking the whole representative for <HI>South</HI> and <HI>North Britain,</HI> the members for counties are only 131 of the 558, of which 131,42 are for <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Wales.</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. XIII.13.</NOTE>. The members, therefore, for the boroughs and cinque ports, which ought not to be one in ten, compared with those for the counties, are 382, above four times as many. So that for one member, who
<PB N="47" REF="013851_0077_0F9E2BBCE8DEE7E8">
may be supposed to come fairly into the house, four (if we except a few for the great cities) are sent by the poorest of the people, directed by court-influence.</P>
<P>We have seen above, p. 38, that, dividing the right of voting as it ought to be, no member should be elected by fewer than the majority of 800 votes. But we find, that not one member of all these 254 is elected by a number so high as 300; and a multi|tude by a number below 20.</P>
<P>If we take the places, where a majority of the elec|tors comes below 20, it is shameful what a propor|tion of the 513 is sent into the house by a handful, and that handful mostly people in low circumstances, and therefore obnoxious to bribery, or under the power of their superiors.</P>

<P>Here we see 56 members (about a ninth part of the whole for <HI>England</HI>) are sent into the house of com|mons by 364 votes, which number ought not to send in one member.

<P>Men of large property ought likewise to have more votes, than those, who have less to secure. Property ought in all states to have its proportional weight and consequence.</P>
<P>In the <HI>East India</HI> act of 1773, which was heavily complained of for its injustice, there is yet one very equitable regulation, and worthy of imitation, viz.

<P>The <HI>British</HI> government, therefore, taking it ac|cording to its avowed state, is neither absolute mo|narchy nor limited monarchy, nor aristocracy, nor democracy, nor a mixture of monarchy, aristocracy
<PB N="50" REF="013851_0080_0F9E2BC0BB142158">
and democracy; but may be called a ptochocracy (the reader will pardon a new word) or government of beggars. For a few beggarly boroughs do avow|edly elect the most important part of the government, the part which commands the purse. It is true this is only the ostensible state of things. The <HI>British</HI> government is <HI>really</HI> a juntocracy (I doubt the reader will now think I presume upon his good nature) or government by a minister and his crew. For the court directs the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eggars whom to chuse.</P>
<P>Is this the universally admired and universally envied <HI>British</HI> constitution?</P>
<P>How much more proper would a petition have been, from the friends of liberty to the king, to set himself at the head of a plan for restoring <HI>indepen|dency</HI> to parliament, than petitioning him to <HI>dis|solve</HI> that which was then sitting. What point could have been gained by that measure? It is a handful of beggars, bribed, or awed, by the court, or the grandees, that sends the majority of the members into the house. Would not they have sent back the <HI>same</HI> men? Did they <HI>dare</HI> to send any <HI>others?</HI> If it be said, that the dissolution of the parliament then sitting would have redressed all grievances, it must follow, that a <HI>new</HI> parliament would; but how many <HI>new</HI> parliaments have we seen since the revolution? Yet we have now standing armies, septennial parliaments, rotten boroughs, placemen in the house, excises, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Though I have not the least idea of wishing so great a change in the constitution, as would exclude king and lords from parliament; yet I may, I think, be allowed just to mention, that the great power by our constitution vested in a <HI>small</HI> number of indivi|duals, which will always make an inequality, and an unbalancing, ought to make us the more desirous
<PB N="51" REF="013851_0081_0F9E2BC229813E80">
of reducing, if possible, <HI>one</HI> of our three estates at least, to somewhat a little nearer to adequate, than it is at present. But of this more hereafter.</P>
<P>Representation in the house of commons is inade|quate in other respects besides those already mentioned.</P>
<P>In antient times, when parliaments were first esta|blished, there was no property, but that of <HI>land.</HI> Therefore all powers, and all honours, were heaped on the landed men. The consequence was, that the landed interest was too well represented, to the detri|ment (in our times) of the mercantile and monied. This is an occasion of various evils. For many of our country-gentlemen are but bad judges of the im|portance of the mercantile interest, and do not wisely consult it in their bills and acts. Of this kind are the game-act, the dog-act, and taxes on every necessary of life, which give our rivals in trade a great advan|tage over us. And ministers, to curry favour with the house of commons, are tempted to burden com|merce with taxes for the sake of easing the landed interest.

VII.285.</NOTE> to this purpose, by proposing to ease the land of one shilling in the pound, and laying a duty on salt for three years, to make up the deficiency. It was objected to this proposal, That the salt-duty was always reckoned a grievous burden upon the manufacturing poor, and was therefore taken off; and that it was a strange paradox, that the <HI>landed</HI> gentlemen were <HI>poorer</HI> than the <HI>poor,</HI> and therefore in more need of relief from a heavy tax.</P>
<P>It is the overbalance of the power in the hands of the landed men, that has produced the bounty on exporta|tion of corn (of which more fully hereafter) which increases the manufacturer's expence of living, and
<PB N="52" REF="013851_0082_0F9E2BC39A051648">
discourages the exportation of our manufactures. This is, in the end, hurtful to the landed interest. But short-sighted and selfish men do not see it in that light; nor will seem to understand, that the land-tax, while nominally three shillings in the pound, is not really nine-pence. The time was, when land in <HI>England</HI> might have been purchased for a 50th part of its present value. What has given it the 49 parts additional worth? Can any one imagine, the diffe|rence is owing to any thing, but our trade and manu|factures?</P>
<P><HI>A. D.</HI> 1373, a parliament being called, it was ex|pressly mentioned in the writ, that from every burgh there should be sent two burgesses,

<P><Q>When the young nobility and gentry (says <HI>Dave|nant</HI>) employ their time and thoughts carefully to in|spect and consider the kingdom's foreign traffic, they will evidently see how much their landed interest de|pends upon it; they will find that as trade brought land from 12 to 25, the general rental from 6 to 14 millions, and the kingdom's capital from 72 to 252 millions, reckoning lands, tenements, hereditaments, and personal estates, 18 years purchase at a medium; so it may bring land from 25 to 50 years purchase, and lands, tenements, hereditaments, &amp;c. from 18 to 26 years purchase, the general rental from 14 millions to 28 millions, and the kingdom's capital from 252
<PB N="53" REF="013851_0083_0F9E2BC41969EF88">
to above 1000 millions, if by industry and prudent management it can be rendered more extensive. But the mutual dependance between land and trade, we hope, has been sufficiently made out in the series of these discourses <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Davon.</HI> II.81.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It was owing to a want of merchants in the house, that the bill for restraining paper-credit in <HI>America</HI> was brought in. And it was no small disgrace to the house, that there were petitions against it presented from most of the agents for the colonies, as an impru|dent and hurtful scheme. <HI>Postlethwayte,</HI> in his DICT. OF COMM. and BRIT. TRUE SYST. has made many remarks on the advantage of merchants in the house of commons; to whom I must refer the reader.</P>
<P>Is not an aristocracy a government in the hands of a few, or of one class, or one interest, excluding the body of the people of property from their due weight in government? Is not our house of peers wholly, and our house of commons chiefly filled with men, whose property is land? Is not therefore the government of this mercantile and manufacturing country in the hands of the landed interest to the exclusion of the mercantile and manufactural? Does not then the go|vernment of this country tend too much to aristocracy?</P>
<P>The eldest sons of <HI>Scotch</HI> peers are declared incapa|ble of sitting in the house of commons <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. IV.105.</NOTE>. But the sons of <HI>English</HI> peers may sit, so that ten individuals out of one family may be legislators. Is not this too aristocratical?</P>
<P>It is said, property in land is more capable of being proved, than in merchandize, manufactures, or stocks. But this is frivolous; for any man, though possessed
<PB N="54" REF="013851_0084_0F9E2BC4CF54F8F8">
of an ostensible land-estate, may be in debt to more than the value of his estate; and where is then his qualification?</P>
<P>The interest of merchants is so much the interest of the nation, that there can hardly be too many mer|chants in parliament. The <HI>London</HI> members almost always vote on the side of liberty. It is objected, that each merchant will probably vote in parliament for what is most for the advantage of his own parti|cular branch. True. Therefore let a considerable number of merchants always have seats in the house, and then all different interests will be consulted. It has likewise been argued, that merchants are bad members, because they are liable to be influenced in favour of the court by government contracts. But here again comes in my observation concerning <HI>par|tial</HI> reformations. Correct all the other abuses, and court-influence will become impossible. Then will appear the advantage of merchants in the house of commons. Of all which more hereafter.</P>
<P>As to the monied interest, if the public debts are not to be paid, or some substantial security found for them, it would be very proper, that the monied interest (as such) should have representation in par|liament. Else what security have we, that a profli|gate court will not shut up the exchequer, as <HI>Charles</HI> II. did, and obtain, by corrupt means, the sanction of parliament for the measure? It is indeed alledged, that the mercantile, manufactural, and monied inte|rests are represented by the members for the cities, and boroughs. But this is nothing to the purpose. Because the qualification required is always to be in land.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. How parliamentary representation came to be thus inadequate.</HEAD>
<P>REpresentation in the commons house of parlia|ment came to be thus out of all proportion inadequate, in much the same manner as cities come to be built in defience of all plan or regu|larity by every land-proprietor's humouring his own caprice in building upon his own ground. Our kings and our queens gave and took away the privilege of sending members, as pleased their fancy without all regard to justice, or proportion.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Carte</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Quoted PARL. HIST. XXI.212.</NOTE> alledges, that the lawyers, in the puritan times, in order to strengthen their own party, searched old records, and found, that many towns of the king's demesne had been summoned once or twice by <HI>Edward</HI> I. to send representatives; and on this founded a pretence, that these were in all times parliament-towns.
<Q>Thus (says he) the puri|tans got the ascendency in the house; and thus was an unreasonable disproportion in the representation of the kingdom introduced to the infinite prejudice of the constitution.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Carte</HI> shews, that the mode of representation established in antient times was tolerably adequate; but
<Q>that the case is now vastly altered. There is no longer any just or reasonable proportion in the representation. For, whilst all the landed interest is represented by 92 members, and the trading or mo|nied
<PB N="56" REF="013851_0086_0F9E2BC64D911178">
interest <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This is not just. For the members sent by cities and great towns are commonly landed gentlemen, as much as the others, and do not consider themselves as particularly obliged to take care of the trading, much less of the monied interest.</NOTE> by about 100 deputies of cities and great towns, there are above 300 representatives of small, inconsiderable, and many of these beggarly boroughs, who by a majority of 3 to 2, are able to dispose of the property of all the landed and opulent men in the kingdom in despite of their unanimous dissent. These have long been considered as the rot|ten part of our constiution, and being venal as well as poor, they have been the chief source of the cor|ruption complained of in modern parliaments.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Foreigners, who know and reflect on this inequa|lity in our representation, which they cannot recon|cile to common sense, stand amazed at hearing us brag of the excellency of our constitution, while it labours under so fundamental a defect, and are apt to doubt, whether the sense of parliament is really the sense of the nation,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Borlase,</HI> author of the NATURAL HIS|TORY OF CORNWAL, only 5 boroughs of that county sent 10 members, and the county 2, 23 <HI>Edw.</HI> I. and <HI>Lestwithiel</HI> sent 2 more, 33 <HI>Edw.</HI> I. Thus it remained, excepting one change, to 6 <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. when 7 other boroughs were allowed to send 2 members each. 1 <HI>Mary,</HI> another was added, and 4 and 5 of the same reign, another. 1 <HI>Eliz.</HI> another; 5 of the same reign, 2 others; 13 of the same queen, 2 others; and 27, another; in all 21 boroughs,

<PB N="57" REF="013851_0087_0F9E2BC8DD742940">
which, with the county, make up 44 members. The cause of this partiality for <HI>Cornwall,</HI> he thinks, was that dutchy's being in the crown, and yielding a greater royal revenue, than any other county, all which was very convenient for our kings and queens, as the places were poor, and consequently dependent. So that pro|bably the very design of giving this privilege to these paltry boroughs was, to obtain for the court an undue influence in parliament. And ought they then to be allowed a privilege, unjust in itself and given with un|just views? Towns came to be burghs (that is, pri|vileged within themselves, and freed from certain taxes and tallages) by charters of lords or kings <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Brady,</HI> 1. <HI>Of BURGHS,</HI> 43.</NOTE>.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Evil of the Boroughs having so disproportionate a Share in Parliamentary Representation.</HEAD>
<P>MEMBERS of parliament have the properties, liberties, and lives of the nation in their hands, and hold themselves accountable to no man, or set of men, for the laws they make. Ought the trustees of so great a charge to be men capable of giving or re|ceiving base bribes? Members of parliament ought to be men of good natural parts, education, and character, sound reasoners, graceful speakers, knowing in the three interests, <HI>viz.</HI> the landed, the commercial, and the monied, in general history, law, and politics, and in the history, laws, and politics of <HI>Britain,</HI> learned in human nature, and masters of the spirit and dispo|sition of the inhabitants of the three kingdoms, and of the colonies. Is it to be conceived, that the inha|bitants of a set of miserable <HI>Cornish</HI> boroughs are judges of such high accomplishments as these? Were election of members of parliament upon its proper foot, every
<PB N="63" REF="013851_0093_0F9E2BCDD8736A28">
county, including its cities and towns, would elect a set of gentlemen to be its representatives. This would concentre the wisdom of the whole county, and not leave it, as at present, in the power of a dozen silly fellows to set up a lawmaker, capable or inca|pable, over their country.</P>
<P>Here I must hint to the reader, that, though I have stated the accomplishments of a member pretty high, I am sensible, that lower, with integrity, will suffice, or at least would, if parliament were upon the proper foot as to independency. But the lamentable part of the case is at present, that by far the greatest part of our electors are wholly incapable of distinguishing, and must be supposed often to chuse the worst qualified of the candidates, and reject the best.</P>
<P>We often see, before a general election, many flam|ing harangues addressed to the people, shewing them the importance of chusing proper persons for so mo|mentous a trust. I have wondered in myself how any man of sense could waste his paper and ink so fruitlessly as in giving people advice, which no man, who knows human nature, can expect them to take. The plain <HI>English</HI> of those harangues is as follows. Illustrious beggars of the <HI>Cornish</HI> boroughs!</P>
<P>Your country expects of you at the approaching election, what every considerate person must conclude to be wholly out of your reach, <HI>viz.</HI> That you will wisely and honestly consider the importance of the trust reposed in you, of sending into the legislative assembly of the nation so great a proportion of the members. It is expected, that you are well qualified, without having ever had the means for being qualified to judge of the fitness of candidates; that you, who have neither knowledge of books, nor of the world,
<PB N="64" REF="013851_0094_0F9E2BCEFB1630B0">
should judge unerringly of the capacities and dispo|sitions of persons, who offer themselves as candidates for your favour. It is likewise expected, illustrious beggars, that you, whose circumstances are, in the most miserable degree, dependent, should be, in your principles and dispositions, independent patriots. As we require a qualification in members of parliament, of several hundreds a year, that they may be above temptation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o we expect of you, who are in conti|nual want, that you defy temptation. Do not, pa|triotic electors, regard the threats of your landlords, when they tell you, they will turn you out of your dwelling. Remember what you ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er learned in <HI>Horace,</HI>

kings and their brothers can, in another more enlight|ened age, give privilege to respectable counties and great cities, to send up that number of representatives, which is found to be adequate to their respective contributions to the public expence.

No invention could have been thought of more fa|vourable to court-influence in parliament, than giv|ing so great importance to the beggarly boroughs. They are the creatures of the court. That is, they receive their privilege from kings; and the burgage

tenures in them generally belong to men of fortune, who have power to oblige the inhabitants of these burgage-houses to elect whom they please. And the court having great funds at its disposal, ambitious and avaritious men are thereby drawn to the court-side in promoting the election of courtly men. But above all, the easiness of bribing a small handful of voters, who have the privilege of sending two members, is ruinous to the independency of the house of commons.</P>

<Q>Many of our boroughs (says my lord <HI>Chesterfield</HI> in speaking on that subject) are now so much the creatures of the crown, that they are generally called court-boroughs, and very properly they are called so. For our ministers for the time being have always the nomination of their re|presentatives, and make such an arbitrary use of it, that they often order them to chuse gentlemen, whom they never saw, nor heard of, perhaps, till they saw their names on the minister's order for chusing them. These orders they always punctually obey, and would, I suppose, obey them, were the person named in them the minister's footman, then actually wearing his livery.

The plain <HI>English</HI> of all this is, that a majority of the members of both houses were, thirty years ago (not in our golden days) so sordidly selfish in their dis|positions, that rather than lose a trifling privilege or profit, they would suffer their country to sink in a quick-sand of corruption. It is to be hoped, that this shocking account of the state of patriotism thirty years ago, was not true. But however the truth may have been, it is particularly remarkable, that an author, who wrote on purpose to shew, that the clamour of the people was groundless, should incautiously confess, that the majority of the legislature was so execrably

Will this defini|tion answer to <HI>Britain</HI> as parliaments now are? when all depends on a set of men authorised by a very small minority both as to numbers and property?</P>
<P>It is a common maxim in politics, that in every state there must be some where an absolute and irresisti|ble power over the people. But this is to be rightly understood, or it will lead to mistakes. In a monar|chy, as <HI>France,</HI> the whole power is in the king against all other voice. This is proper tyranny. At <HI>Venice</HI> it is in the nobles exclusively. This is proper aristocracy, or oligarchy. In <HI>Holland</HI> (excepting some errors and deviations) the whole power is in the states, that is, or should be, the people; but it does not descend low enough, and leaves the bourgeoisie considerably enslaved. In <HI>England</HI> the whole power is in king, lords, and commons. Therefore in monar|chies the <HI>people,</HI> the chief object, have no share of power. In oligarchies the people have as little. In republics the people have a share of power. But in our mixed government the people are swallowed up in king, lords, and commons. To say, therefore, that
<PB N="72" REF="013851_0102_0F9E2B19199777C8">
there must be in every country an absolute power somewhere <HI>over the people,</HI> and in which they are to have no share, is making the people mere beasts of burden, instead of what they are, viz. the original of power, the object of government, and last resource. Our courtly people, therefore, to quiet our minds on this subject, tell us, we have a very great share in governing ourselves, as we elect our law-makers. We have seen, what this amounts to. And if any <HI>Eng|lishman</HI> is satisfied with the view I have given of parliamentary representation, I can only say, he is thankful for small mercies.</P>
<P>There will be occasion to exhibit much more on this subject in the following chapters on <HI>Corruption,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Inadequate Representation universally complained of. Proposals by various Persons for redressing this Irregularity.</HEAD>
<P>THE monstrous inequality of parliamentary repre|sentation has not escaped unobserved. And there have been attempts made to reform it.</P>
<P><Q>To what gross absurdities, (says Mr. <HI>Locke</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">On GOVERNMENT, chap. XIII. &sect; 157.</NOTE>) the following of custom, when reason has left it, may lead, we may be satisfied, when we see the bare name of a town, of which there remains not so much as the ruins, where scarce so much housing as a sheep-cot, or more inhabitants than a shepherd, are to be found, send as many representatives to the grand assembly of law-makers, as a whole county numerous in people, and powerful in riches.</Q>
He afterwards shews (contrary
<PB N="73" REF="013851_0103_0F9E2B19E4710678">
to the common objection, That this deviation must not be corrected, because such correction would pro|duce a violation of the constitution) that restoring adequate representation, would be precisely what is wanted toward establishing the constitution on its true and original principles. <Q>This irregularity of repre|sentation strangers stand amazed at, and every one must confess, needs a remedy, though most think it hard to find one, because the constitution of the legislative being the original and supreme act of the society antecedent to all positive laws in it, and, depending wholly upon the people, no inferior power can alter it; and therefore the people, when the legislative is once constituted, having, in such a government as we have been speaking of, no power to act, as long as that government stands; this inconvenience is thought incapable of a remedy.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Salus populi suprema lex,</HI> is certainly so just and fundamental a rule, that who sincerely follows it cannot dangerously err. If therefore the executive, who has the power of convoking the legislative, observing rather the true proportion, than the fashion of representation, regulates, not by old custom, but true proportion, the number of members in all places, that have a right to be distinctly represented, which no part of the people, however incorporated, can pretend to, but in proportion to the assistance it affords to the public; it cannot be judged to have set up a new legislative, but to have restored the old and true one, and to have rectified the disorders, which the succession of time had insensibly, as well as inevitably introduced. For it being the interest, as well as the intention of the people, to have a fair and equal representative, whoever brings it nearest to that, is an undoubted friend to, and establisher of
<PB N="74" REF="013851_0104_0F9E2B1C4A6F5F18">
the government, and cannot miss the consent and approbation of the community. Prerogative being nothing but a power in the hands of the prince to provide for the public good in such cases, which depending upon unforeseen and uncertain occurrences certain and unalterable laws could not safely direct; whatsoever shall be done manifestly for the good of the people, and establishing the gover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ent on its true foundation, is, and always will be, true and just prerogative. The power of erecting new cor|porations, and therewith new representatives, carries with it a supposition, that, in time, the measures of representation might vary, and those places have a just right to be represented, which before had none, and by the same reason, those cease to have a right, and become too inconsiderable for such a privilege, which before had it. It is not a change from the present state, which perhaps corruption, or decay, has intro|duced, that makes an inroad upon government; but its tendency to injure and oppress the people, and to set up one part, or party, with a distinction from, and unequal subjection to the rest. <Q>Whatsoever cannot but be acknowledged to be of advantage to the society and people in general, upon just and lasting measures, will always, when done, justify itself, and whenever the people shall chuse their representatives upon just and undoubtedly equal measures, suitable to the original frame of the govern|ment, it cannot be doubted to be the will and act of the society, whoever permitted or caused them to do it <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Locke</HI> on GOVERNMENT, fol. edit. p. 220.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> hints, in this passage, the propriety of our kings applying their prerogative to the restoring
<PB N="75" REF="013851_0105_0F9E2B1E36840630">
of a more adequate representation. Nor is there any thing unreasonable in the proposal; since it is noto|rious, that a great part of the monstrous disproportion of representation in parliament, is owing to the caprice of our crowned heads in opening the house of com|mons to numbers, who had no original right to enter it. And if, in order to restore the balance, we were to disfranchise 50 or 60 of the beggarly boroughs, we should do nothing unprecedented. For <HI>Willis</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">NOT. Parl. III.81.</NOTE> gives an account of above 60
<Q><HI>disused</HI> or <HI>obsolete</HI> boroughs and towns, which were <HI>antiently</HI> summoned to send members to parliament,</Q>
viz. <HI>Donestable, Newbury, Ely,</HI> &amp;c. Where are now the members for those places? They would have made, he says <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pref. p. XXX.</NOTE>,
<Q>a parlia|ment near half as numerous as the representative of the burghs was before <HI>Edward</HI> VI.</Q>
If our former kings and queens filled and emptied the house of com|mons at their pleasure, why should not our modern crowned heads have power to set right what they set wrong, either by diminishing (with consent of par|liament) the exorbitant number of borough members, or increasing the representation of the counties, add|ing members to <HI>London, Westminster,</HI> and <HI>Southwark,</HI> to <HI>Bristol,</HI> to <HI>Liverpool,</HI> &amp;c. or by some means, or other, take legislation out of the hands of the beg|gars, and put it into those of men of property.</P>
<P><Q>It is plausibly urged,</Q>
says a speaker in the house of commons<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">LOND. MAG. <HI>Iune,</HI> 1771, p. 287.</NOTE>,
<Q>that the voice of the nation is only to be heard in this assembly [the house of commons]; but plausibility is one thing, and truth another. This assembly does not constitute a real representa|tive
<PB N="76" REF="013851_0106_0F9E2B1F65F7AA60">
of the kingdom. The metropolis, for instance, which contains at least a 6th part of the people, sends to parliament only 8 members, and many of the principle trading towns send none.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A great inconvenience springs from the constitu|tion of the boroughs,</Q>
(says a writer in the time of K. <HI>William</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">STATE TRACTS, time of K. <HI>William,</HI> I.161.</NOTE>) <Q>which elect not by virtue of their wealth, dignity, or number of inhabitants, but by the borough-houses, in which they live;</Q> these only (which perhaps are the most inconsiderable part of the borough) having in them the electing power exclusive of the rest. This qualification makes such houses sell better to a purchaser, than any others in the town; and it is customary for gentlemen, who are desirous of a seat in parliament, to lay out their money in such bargains, and though it costs them dear, yet, if it be possible, they will be land-lords of a sufficient number of these borough-houses (in the purchase whereof some friend's name is mostly made use of in trust) that thereby they may command an election either for themselves, or their assigns, at pleasure. And what is this less than buying of votes with money?
<Q>This is what is called the rotten part of the constitution. It cannot continue the century. If it does not drop, it must be amputated,</Q>
said lord <HI>Cha|tham,</HI> in his speech on the stamp-act.</P>
<P><HI>Cromwel</HI>'s plan of a parliament <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitelocke</HI>'s MEMOIRS, 552.</NOTE> was briefly as fol|lows: The period triennial; the whole number of members to be 400 for <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI>; 30 for <HI>Scotland.</HI> and 30 for <HI>Ireland.</HI> The number of mem|bers
<PB N="77" REF="013851_0107_0F9E2B1FD8B67A20">
for some of the most remarkable places was as follows; <HI>Cornwal</HI> 12, <HI>Devonshire</HI> 20, <HI>York</HI> 22, <HI>Essex</HI> 16, <HI>Kent</HI> 18, <HI>Middlesez</HI> 6; <HI>London</HI> 6, <HI>Bristol</HI> 2. He also intended members for several places, which now send none, as <HI>Manchester,</HI> &amp;c. Every reader will observe, that this scheme was far from being an adequate representation, though much pre|ferable to the present. Of the 400 <HI>English</HI> members, 270 were county-members; which gave the counties the advantage they ought to have over the boroughs; whereas in our times the borough members out-num|ber those for the counties 4 times over. Every per|son worth 200<HI>l.</HI> real or personal was to have right of voting; whereas in our times, hardly any, but beg|gars, have weight in appointing the representative. <HI>Fairfax</HI> in his scheme for settling the nation, proposes adequate representation by counties <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. XVI.205.</NOTE>. Lord <HI>Chatham</HI> has proposed, that a third member be added to the representation for each county. This would be of service; but would not redress the evil. For represen|tation would be still out of proportion, as the borough members would still out-number those for the counties. Lord <HI>Molesworth</HI> is for transferring the members for the mean boroughs to the great places. Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> proposes <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">ESSAYS, II.375.</NOTE>, as an improvement of the <HI>British</HI> constitution, the restoration of the plan of the republican parliament, and allowing no person to vote, who did not possess a property [he does not confine it to land] of 200<HI>l.</HI> value. Mr. <HI>Carte</HI> pro|poses, for equalling representation, to give all persons possessed of property within the <HI>hundred,</HI> in which is a small borough (which now of <HI>itself</HI> sends two mem|bers)
<PB N="78" REF="013851_0108_0F9E2B2092F2D480">
a right of voting equally with the men of the borough; and to make the steward, or judge of the hundred court a joint returning officer with the pre|sent borough-officer. This would render bribery more difficult, than it is, but would not make parlia|mentary representation adequate.</P>
<P>On this subject the author of the DISSERT. UPON PARTIES <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P. 218.</NOTE>, reasons as follows: `At the settling of the revolution, those persons, who had exclaimed so loudly against placemen and pensioners in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and who complained at that instant so bitterly of the undue influence that had been employed in small boroughs, chiefly to promote the elections of the parliament which sat in the reign of <HI>Iames</HI> II. ought to have been attentive, one would think, to take the glorious opportunity, that was furnished them by a new settlement of the crown, and of the constitution, to secure the independency of parlia|ments effectually for the future. <HI>Machiavel</HI> observes, and makes it the title of one of his discourses, That a free government, in order to maintain itself free, hath need every day of some new provisions in favour of liberty. The truth of this observation, and the reasons that support <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, are obvious. But as every day may not furnish opportunities of making some of these new and necessary provisions, no day, that does furnish the opportunity, ought to be neglected. The <HI>Romans</HI> had been so liberal in bestowing the right of citizens on strangers, that the power of their elections began to fall into such hands as the consti|tution had not intended to trust with them. <HI>Quin|tus

Fabius</HI> saw the growing evil; and being censor, he took the opportunity; confined all these new el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tors into four tribes, put it out of their power to turn the elections, as they had done whilst their numbers were divided among all the tribes; freed his country from this danger; restored the constitution accord|ing to the true intent and meaning of it; and ob|tained, by universal suffrage, the title of <HI>Maximus.</HI> If a spirit like this had prevailed among us at the time we speak of, something like this would have been done; and surely something like it ought to have been done, for the revolution was in many instances, and it ought to have been so in all, one of those renovations of our constitution which we have often mentioned. If it had been such with respect to the electing of members to serve in par|liament, these elections might have been drawn back to the antient principle, on which they had been established; and the rule of property, which was followed antiently, and was perverted by innumerable changes which length of time produced, might have been restored, by which the communities, to whom the right of electing was trusted, as well as the qua|lifications of the electors and the elected, might have been settled in propor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on to the then present state of things. Such a remedy might have wrought a radical cure of the evil which threatens our consti|tution; whereas it is much to be apprehended, even from experience, that all others are merely palli|ative.</P>
<P><HI>Brady</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1. OF BURGS, 60.</NOTE> mentions resolutions of the house of com|mons, That in all places, where there is neither char|ter,

OF BURGHS, 60.</NOTE>. But the resolutions of the house on this, as on many other points, are often inconsistent. <HI>Brady</HI> (who shews great fear lest the people should have any li|berty, or power) thinks the commons founded this resolution so favourable to the people, on a mistake as to the sense of the phrase, <HI>communitas civitatum et burgorum</HI>; which meant, he thinks, the governing part of cities and burghs, not the housholders in gene|ral.

<HEAD>BOOK III. Of the second Constitutional Irre|gularity in our Parliaments, viz. The excessive Length&punc; of their Period.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Parliaments were originally annual.</HEAD>
<P><Q>WHERE annual election ends, slavery begins,</Q>
says the author of HISTOR. ESS. ON THE BRIT. CONST. A maxim of equal solidi|ty in politics with that of my late amiable friend Dr. <HI>Foster</HI> in divinity, viz.
<Q>Where mystery begins, reli|gion ends.</Q>
Long parliaments are incompatible with liberty. To give a set of men power for a long pe|riod of time, is giving them the hint, that they may make themselves despots, if they please. Kings and grandees are tyrants only because they know they have their power during life. But of the danger of inveterate power I shall have occasion to treat more fully hereafter.</P>
<P>Parliaments, according to <HI>Postlethwayte</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DICT. II.413.</NOTE>, were ori|ginally annual; and antiently all the people voted at elections, till <HI>Henry</HI> VI. enacted, that only freehol|ders

residing in the country, and who had an income of 40<HI>s.</HI> a year, should vote.
<Q>That parliaments were formerly chosen fresh and fresh, is evident; since there be writs extant for new elections for 80 years successively;</Q>
says the learned writer of a piece entitled, LIMITATIONS FOR THE SUCCESSOR, &amp;c. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">STATE TRACTS, Time of K. <HI>Will.</HI> III.386.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the <HI>Saxon</HI> times it cannot well be supposed, that parliaments could be longer than annual, were it only for one reason, viz. That the members of their <HI>wittena gemots,</HI> or parliaments, were mayors, or officers, who held their offices only one year, at the end of which they were obliged to divest themselves of all power, and to assemble the people for new election. It was agreed, that a parliament should be held twice every year at <HI>London,</HI> and this continued from king <HI>Alfred</HI>'s time to that of <HI>Edward</HI> II. as ap|pears by <HI>Horn</HI>'s MIRR. OF JUST. chap. 1. sect. 2. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. I.163.</NOTE>' <HI>A. D.</HI> 1378, a parliament was called, because, a|mong other reasons, it was constitutional, that par|liaments should be held annually <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. I.370.</NOTE>. The commons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1940, regret, they had not made parliaments annual, instead of triennial. By two statutes, they say, they found parliaments once a year still in force<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rap.</HI> 11.394.</NOTE>. When the triennial bill was established, in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> I. after an intermission of 12 years, the king, in the genuine spirit of a <HI>Stuart,</HI> made a merit of his agreeing to the bill. The commons would not allow it; but insisted, that there were then in force two statutes for annual elections.
<Q>The bill for triennial parliaments, says <HI>Milton</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Milt.</HI> EIKON. 64.</NOTE>, was but the <HI>third</HI> part of one good step towards that which
<PB N="85" REF="013851_0115_0F9E2B28A9894148">
in times past was our <HI>annual</HI> right.</Q>
<HI>Milton</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">EIKON. 65.</NOTE> says this triennial bill of which <HI>Charles</HI> made a great merit, was much less than two statutes yet in force of <HI>Ed|ward</HI> III. Nay, in a book, entitled, THE RIGHTS OF THE KINGDOM, the MIRROR OF JUSTICES is quoted, that parliaments by the old laws, ought to be held twice a year. If so, we are deprived of 13 parts in 14 of our antient privilege.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Wyndham,</HI> in the debate on the repeal of the septennial act, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1734, gives the true acoount of this matter.
<Q>At the time of the revolu|tion, says he, nay at the present time, at all times, the word <HI>parliament</HI> in the common way of speaking comprehends all the sessions from one election to another. That this is the common meaning of the word, I appeal to every gentleman in this house; and for this reason those patriots, who drew up our CLAIM OF RIGHTS, could not imagine that it was necessary to put in the word <HI>new</HI>; they could not so much as dream that the two words, <HI>frequent parliaments,</HI> would afterwards be interpreted to mean <HI>frequent sessions</HI> of parliament, but the lawyers, who are accustomed to confound the sense of the plainest words, immediately found out that a <HI>session</HI> of par|liament was a <HI>parliament</HI>; meant only <HI>frequent ses|sions.</HI> This quirk the lawyers found out immedi|ately after the revolution; this quirk the courtiers at that time caught hold of; and this set the people anew upon the vindication of their rights, which they obtained by the triennial bill. By that bill the right of the people to frequent <HI>new</HI> parliaments was
<PB N="86" REF="013851_0116_0F9E2B29083DB5F0">
established in such clear terms, as not to be misun|derstood, and God forgive them who consented to the giving it up. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. VIII.190.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The answer given by the king (that is, the mini|ster) to the remonstrances requesting the dissolution of a supposed corrupt parliament, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1770, was, That the remonstrances were disrespectful to his ma|jesty, injurious to parliament, and irreconcileable with the principles of the constitution.' It were to be wished, that the public had been better satisfied of the justness of this answer. Does not the very idea of petitioning imply acknowledgment of <HI>superi|ority</HI> in the person addressed to? Were not the remon|strances addressed to the king by his titles of sove|reignty? Was not an appeal to the sovereign from a supposed corrupt ministry and parliament doing <HI>honour,</HI> nay, was it not doing the <HI>highest</HI> honour in the power of the remonstrants, to the throne, and to the <HI>person</HI> of the king, as supposing, that from him <HI>alone</HI> there was hope of redress? Again, what injury to parliaments in <HI>general</HI> was done by requesting the dissolution of a <HI>particular</HI> parliament? If the members had acted uprightly, it was to be expected, that their constitu|ents (if free) would immediately re-elect them, which instead of disgrace, would have reflected the highest <HI>honour</HI> upon them. If indeed it had been confessed, that many members, from a consciousness of their corrupt practices, had reason to fear the loss of their seats, the case was otherwise: but this was too shame|ful to confess. Or if it had been said, that a majority of the electors, being dependent on their members, or obnoxious to bribery, would of course have re-chosen the same men, at worst the dissolution of the
<PB N="87" REF="013851_0117_0F9E2B29B5590F08">
parliament would have been nugatory. But it would have shewed the people, that the king was willing to listen to the request of 60,000 of his subjects. Lastly, as to the remonstrances being irreconcilable with the principles of the constitution; it is strange that there should be any thing <HI>unconstitutional</HI> in requesting the king to do what the <HI>constitution</HI> gives him a <HI>power</HI> to do at <HI>any time</HI>; what <HI>William</HI> III. did in compliance with a petition from one county; what <HI>George</HI> II. did without solicitation, and without blame, when he dissolved one of his parliaments at the end of the 6th session, with the view, according to some, of pre|venting the irregularities of a long electioneering time. It is strange that there should be any thing unconsti|tutional in the king's <HI>dissolving</HI> a parliament at the request of 6 times the number and 60 times the pro|perty that <HI>made</HI> them a parliament. It is strange, that there should be any thing unconstitutional in dis|solving a parliament which had sat <HI>several</HI> years, when we know, that the <HI>length</HI> of parliaments is one of our greatest grievances, and that our kings could not any way more effectually shew themselves to be the <HI>friends</HI> of the <HI>constitution,</HI> than by regularly dissolving every parliament at the end of the <HI>first</HI> session.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Brief History of the lengthening and shortening of Parliament.</HEAD>
<P>PARLIAMENTS seldom sat, in former times, many months.
<Q>In one year there were sometimes 2, sometimes 3 parliaments, says Sir <HI>Simon Dewes</HI> on

viz. almost a whole year, under <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. was three times prorogued, which was then an innovation <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. II.107.</NOTE>.

The un|thinking people of <HI>Charles</HI> II's. time were contented if there was no interruption of parliaments, longer than for three years. <HI>Henry</HI> VIths reign was the first in which prorogations began to be made for any time, and they were but very little used till <HI>Hen.</HI> VIIIths time. The usual way formerly was to call a parliament at least once a year, and as soon as the business was done, to dissolve them <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See REASONS FOR ANNUAL PARL. ST.

<P><HI>Charles, A.

to be held annually. It enacts, that if the chancellor does not issue out writs, any 12 peers shall in the king's name; failing them, the sheriffs, mayors, bailiffs, &amp;c. shall cause elections to be made; they neglecting, the electors shall proceed as if writs had been regularly issued. It had been happy if the peo|ple had been constituted with authority to make laws, when the legislature did not their duty. The pream|ble to the repeal of this salutary law, puts it upon the derogation it is from the king's prerogative. As if the <HI>salus populi</HI> were not of infinitely more consequence than the king's prerogative, whose only value is its usefulness to the <HI>people.</HI></P>
<P>The army demanded, <HI>A.D.</HI> 1647, that parliaments should be triennial, and the dissolution of them not in the king's power. A representative according to the contributions respectively paid to the public by coun|ties; and that improper members be expelled <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Macaul.</HI> IV.329.</NOTE>. The army at this time seem to have been the most reasonable set of men in the nation. Before <HI>Charles</HI> Ist's time the members of the house of commons never dreamed of their having power to continue themselves in office one hour beyond the time limited by their constituents.</P>
<P>The author of HISTOR. ESSAYS ON THE ENGL. CONSTIT. is too severe against the long parliament which opposed <HI>Charles</HI> I. They certainly meant honestly, having no byass to draw them from the public interest, though they sat too long, fearing, perhaps, that their successors might not be as faithful as them|selves. It was much more clearly disinterested than the protracting of parliament from triennial to septen|nial for the pretended fear of a jacobite parliament. He says it was madness in the people to rejoice upon
<PB N="90" REF="013851_0120_0F9E2B2C44311AD8">
the king's consenting, for 600,000 <HI>l.</HI> raised for him, not to dissolve parliament without their own consent. This was the first protraction of the period of parlia|ment, and taught ill-designing ministers to imitate it. It is an evil of kingly government, that through fear of tyranny, well meaning people have often consented to what was unconstitutional. So in the alteration from triennial to septennial, jacobitism, or an attachment to a race of <HI>kings,</HI> was the cause of the irregularity.</P>
<P>The triennial bill was repealed, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1664. and instead of it a law to prevent parliaments having vaca|tions of more than three years <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rapin,</HI> II.635. DEB. LORDS, I.66.</NOTE>. One would think all memory of <HI>Iames</HI> I. and <HI>Charles</HI> I. was miraculously obliterated out of the minds of the people of <HI>England.</HI> It was but 15 years before that <HI>Charles</HI> I. was beheaded; and the people (or the parliament at least) were for trusting their all again to kings. The long, or pen|sioned parliament meets 1661, agreeable to the court, and says <HI>Rapin,</HI>
<Q>without doubt by the influence of the court.</Q>
Great part were high church men and royalists. Pensioning begun afterwards, tho' at the beginning of this parliament they shewed a great par|tiality for the king <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rapin,</HI> II.625.</NOTE>.

triennial bill receives the royal assent, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1694 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tind.</HI> CONTIN. I.260&middot;</NOTE>. And the historian observes, that if our good king had not done it that day (queen <HI>Mary</HI> just taken ill of the small-pox, of which she died) it is probable he never would have given it the royal assent. So indifferent are even our best kings about bills tending to the en|largement of the people's liberty. At the same time, it must be owned, <HI>William</HI> had some reason to dread a change of parliaments. The abbe <HI>Reynel</HI> tells us <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">HIST. PARL. ENGL. 272.</NOTE>, that when this triennial bill was under consideration, queen <HI>Mary</HI> desired lord <HI>Bellamont,</HI> her treasurer, to oppose it. He refused. He was desired only to be <HI>neutral.</HI> He proved, on the contrary, very active in <HI>promoting</HI> the bill. The queen dismissed him from his post. He retired to privacy and frugality. The queen, overcome by his obstinate virtue, offered him a pension. He declined it, saying, He had no right to a reward, as he did no service. It is wonderful, that <HI>George</HI> I. should so easily obtain the repeal of so favourite an act. A strong clause was added by the lords to the bill of rights, excluding effectually all popish successors to the throne. Passed <HI>easily</HI> by the commons, which looks as if the tory and popish par|ties had not been so strong in the house and kingdom as those who brought in the septennial bill pretended. This was <HI>A. D.</HI> 1689, and septennial parliaments were established <HI>A. D.</HI> 1716 <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tind.</HI> CONTIN. I.55.</NOTE>. It is hardly to be ima|gined that there should be more danger from Jaco|bitism in 1716 than in 1689, the very year after <HI>Iames</HI>'s abdication. All this shews how flimzy the pretences are for what is big with so much evil. So <HI>Iulius
<PB N="92" REF="013851_0122_0F9E2B2D59069208">
Caesar</HI> was appointed, by the senate and people of <HI>Rome,</HI> dictator for 6 months. He made himself perpetual dictator. All the world condemns this tyrannical pro|ceeding. The house of commons, 2 <HI>George</HI> I. was elected, as usual, for three years. They elected them|selves for four years more, without leave of their con|stituents, given, or even asked! O! but the danger of a Jacobite parliament, if a new election was brought on! True. And in the same manner <HI>Caesar,</HI> in his civil war, tells us, he feared <HI>Pompey</HI>'s tyranny; if he himself resigned the dictatorial power. Some authors tell us, the septennial act was made on purpose to save an odius ministry, who dreaded a new and in|corrupt parliament. Thirty lords (even lords!) pro|tested against the septennial act. And Mr. <HI>Snell</HI> told the house of commons, they might as well make them|selves perpetual at once, as continue themselves one month beyond the time, for which they were elected.</P>
<P>It was a singular modesty in the lords to origi|nate in their house an act relating to the commons. Therefore lord <HI>Guernsey</HI> moved the commons, to throw it out of the house, without reading it. It was answerd, That the triennial act had originated in the house of peers. [But if they were allowed to make a <HI>salutary</HI> proposal concerning what they had nothing to do with, it does not follow, that they are to be suffered to go out of their way to do <HI>mischief</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Deb. COM. VI.68.</NOTE>.] Carried 276 to 156 for a second reading, the <HI>Tuesday</HI> after. Petitions were sent from many towns against it. And when this self-prolonged parliament (which, says the author of the USE and ABUSE OF PARLIA|MENT <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">I.251.</NOTE>,

came at last to be dissolved, the cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> with bells, bon|fires, illuminations, and every other demonstration of joy, celebrated its demise, as a deliverance from their worst enemies.</P>
<P>The motion for repealing the septennial act, <HI>A.

The proposal was made by Sir <HI>Iohn Barnard,</HI> which gives me a better opinion of him, than of <HI>Pultney</HI> and <HI>Sandys</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. XIII.219.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>A. D.</HI> 1744, a motion was made for annual par|liaments <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. II.1&mdash;63.</NOTE>. Passed in the negative 145 to 113. Therefore 113 thought it right. Let not then the proposal of annual parliaments be thought <HI>romantic.</HI></P>
<P>A motion was made, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1747, for leave to bring in a bill for shortening the term and duration of future parliaments:
<Q>a measure truly patriotic, a|gainst which no substantial argument could be pro|duced, although the motion was rejected by the ma|jority, on the pretence that whilst the nation was en|gaged in such a dangerous and expensive war, it would be improper to think of introducing such an alteration in the form of government<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. V.221.</NOTE>.</Q>
This was setting common sense upon its head. The danger of the times is the very best reason for making salutary al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rations, and abolishing <HI>dangerous</HI> abuses.</P>
<P>Parliament was dissolved at the end of the 6th ses|sion, 1747, for a whimsical reason, according to some,
<PB N="94" REF="013851_0124_0F9E2B2F31ED6328">
<HI>viz.</HI> because the <HI>Dutch</HI> were in doubt, whether <HI>Britain</HI> would persevere in her schemes, which were favour|able to them, if the same parliament continued to sit. I should have thought the danger of a change of coun|sels was in case of a <HI>change</HI> of parliament <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. III.52.</NOTE>. Some said, as above observed, it was done to shorten the time, and lessen the mischiefs of electioneering. The king in his speech pretends that he dissolved the par|liament to shew his intire confidence in the affections of his people, and that he did not depend merely on a particular set of men in the house of commons <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 54.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that parliaments were originally renewed <HI>every year,</HI> and that a parliament and a session were the same thing. That they held on in this way with little variation, to the times of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. That annual parliaments were restored under <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary.</HI> That they were made triennial, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1640. That in the time of the troubles under <HI>Charles</HI> I. they were very irregular, and protracted to an enormous length; the house of peers abolished, and the rump, or remainder of the commons, kicked out by <HI>Crom|wel.</HI> That under <HI>Charles</HI> II. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1664, the trien|nial bill was repealed, and the period of parliaments left to the arbitrary pleasure of the prince. That his long, or pensioned parliament met, <HI>A.

of <HI>Sylla</HI> and <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> they were notorious usurpations, and violations of the laws of their coun|try. The dictator was not allowed to march out of <HI>Italy,</HI> lest he should take advantage of the distance of the place to attempt something against the com|mon liberty. He was always to march on foot, except in case of a tedious and sudden expedition, and then he formally asked leave of the people to ride. In all other things his power was absolute and uncon|trouled. He might proclaim war, levy forces, lead them out, disband them, &amp;c. without consulting the senate. He could punish as he pleased; and from his judgment lay no appeal. To make his authori|ty more aweful, he had always twenty-four fasces with axes carried before him, if we believe <HI>Plutarch,</HI> and <HI>Polybius. Livy</HI> ascribes the first rise of this cus|tom to <HI>Sylla.</HI> The authority of all other magistrates ceased, or was subordinate to him. He had the naming of the general of the horse, who was wholly at his command. When his authority expired, he was not obliged&punc; to give an account of any thing he had done during his administration.</Q>
[And we know accordingly what tyrants the dictators proved.] <Q>In short, the dictatorship was a kind of absolute monar|chy, though not durable, and was looked upon as the only refuge of the commonwealth in time of danger, till <HI>Sylla</HI> and <HI>Caesar</HI> converting it into a tyran|ny, rendered the name of dictator odious, insomuch that, upon the fall of the latter, a decree passed in the senate, forbidding the use of that dignity upon any account whatsoever for the future.</Q></P>
<P>The greater the power is, says <HI>Livy,</HI> the shorter ought to be the time of holding it. Nothing is more advantageous for a state, says <HI>Seneca,</HI> than that great power be short. When the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> judges were

<P>The <HI>Romans,</HI> in their best times, jealous of those who assumed power, had almost condemned <HI>Marcius</HI> to death for assuming the title of propraetor given him by the army, but without authority of the senate, though he had just then gained a glorious victory in <HI>Spain</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">ANT.

It is true the people often broke through this wise regulation, and suffered power to be too often, and to continue too long, in the same person, or family, as in the case of <HI>Rutil. Censorius</HI> created censor twice together, and of <HI>Fabius</HI>'s son made con|sul, after that authority had been often conferred on the father, so that he himself declared against the peo|ple's partiality for his family.
<Q>The last <HI>Roman decemviri,</HI> though chosen by their country but for a year, prolonged their term by their own act, and retained the power they had usurped, till the people forced it out of their hands, and punished them severely for their usurpation. Their memory stands branded in history with all the infamy it deserves; while the names of <HI>Valerius</HI> and <HI>Horatius,</HI> under whose conduct the people recovered their right of electing annual magistrates, are celebrated by their historians with all the praises that gratitude can yield, or merit claim, monuments more lasting than brass or marble <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">PREP.

<P><Q>For the general government of the country, the antient <HI>Saxons</HI> [our ancestors] ordained 12 noblemen chosen from among others for their worthiness and sufficiency. These in the time of peace, rode their several circuits, to see justice, and good customs ob|served, and they often of course, at appointed times, met altogether to consult and give order in publick affairs; but ever in time of war one of these twelve was chosen to be king, and to remain so long only as the war lasted; and that being ended, his name and dignity of king also ceased, and he became as before; and this custom continued among them until the time of their wars with the emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Great. At which time, <HI>Wittekind,</HI> one of these twelve, a nobleman of <HI>Angria</HI> in <HI>Westphalia,</HI> bore over the rest the name and authority of king; and he being after|ward, by means of the said emperor, converted to the

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Sense of Mankind on inveterate Power; or Arguments for short Parliaments.</HEAD>
<P>I Will throw together in this chapter some of the best arguments for short parliaments, that have occured to me in the course of my reading. I hope the reader will excuse any deficiencies he may find in the arrangement of them.</P>
<P>To take the character of man from history, he is a creature capable of any thing the most infer|nally cruel and horrid, when actuated by interest, or what is more powerful than interest, passion, and not in immediate fear of punishment from his fellow-creatures; for damnation lies out of sight.

<P>The love of power is natural; it is insatiable; it is whetted, not cloyed, by possession. All men possessed
<PB N="107" REF="013851_0137_0F9E2B3ADA12AEC0">
of power may be expected to endeavour to prolong it beyond the due time, and to encrease it beyond the due bounds; neither of which can be attempted with|out danger to liberty. Therefore government (by such frail and imperfect creatures as men) is impossible without continual danger to liberty <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Bolingbr.</HI> REM. HIST. ENGL. 9.</NOTE>. Yet we find that men in all ages and nations have shewn an asto|nishing credulity in their faithless fellow-creatures; they have hoped against hope; they have believed a|gainst the sight of their own eyes.</P>
<P>Were any foreigner of good understanding to be asked, what he thought would, be the consequence of our commons being elected by so small a number of the people, and of their sitting for seven years, he would answer, that without a reformation of these irregula|rities, the <HI>British</HI> government must unavoidably run into an aristocracy, or tyranny of a few, the most odius of all forms of government. Yet the good people of <HI>England</HI> sleep very sound; and foreigners ad|mire and envy our form of government. The truth is, that neither foreigners nor <HI>English</HI> consider much besides the <HI>theory</HI> of our constitution. They admire what it ought to be, and would be, if we had the true spirit of it, while they have reason to execrate it as it is in our times, and to look forward with horror on what it is like to end in.</P>
<P><Q>We know by infinite examples and experience, says the excellent <HI>Gordon,</HI> that men possessed of power rather than part with it, will do any thing, even the worst and the blackest, to keep it; and scarce ever any man upon earth went out of it as long as he could carry every thing his own way in

it; and only when he could not, he resigned; I doubt that there is not one exception in the world to this rule; and that <HI>Dioclesian, Charles</HI> the Vth, and even <HI>Sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">la,</HI> laid down their power out of pique and discontent, and from opposition and disappoint|ment; this seems certain, that the good of the world or of their people, was not one of their motives either for continuing in power, or for quitting it. It is the nature of power to be ever incroaching, and converting every extraordinary power, granted at particular times, and upon particular occasions, into an ordinary power to be used at all times, and when there is no occasion; nor does it ever part willingly with any advantage. From this spirit it is, that oc|casional commissions have grown sometimes perpe|tual; that three years have been improved into seven, and one into twenty; and that when the people have done with their magistrates, their magistrates will not have done with the people<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">CATO'S LETT. IV.82.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It is justly observed by judge <HI>Blackstone,</HI> that the greatest superiority any man can obtain over another, is to make laws, by which he shall be bound. And surely the greater the power, the greater danger of its becoming inveterate in the same hands.</P>
<P>A wise people will not suffer combinations of great families. The monopally of power is the most dan|gerous of all monopolies. An <HI>Athenian</HI> was banished by the ostracism, if 6000 citizens all of at least 60 years of age agreed, that it was necessary.

If votes are purchased by places, and members are more than reimbursed their own shares of the public taxes, they become interested to load the people, in order to fill their own pockets. Accordingly let it be considered what a load might now be taken off from the people by annihilating useless places and corrupt pensions.

Our <HI>Edwards</HI> and <HI>Henries</HI> often put a stop to the course of their victories to meet parliament. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were peculiarly cautious about the frequency of their state meetings. Their <HI>Sanchos, Henries, Ferdinands,</HI> and <HI>Charles's</HI> were very careful of this. Under <HI>Charles,</HI> who was particularly exact in this respect, the <HI>Spanish</HI> monarchy was most flourishing. His son <HI>Philip</HI> pursued a contrary plan of encroachment on the people, and first eclipsed the glory of the monarchy. In <HI>France,</HI> under <HI>Clovis, Pepin, Charlemagne, Capet,</HI> and his successors for ages, the meetings of the states were cherished. <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. and most of his successors have promoted the contrary scheme of government, without the people. The consequences have been continual insurrections, tu|mults, and leagues. The subjects have often returned with interest on the heads of their ambitious princes, the damages they have suffered at their hands, which has reduced the kingdom to extreme distress. The struggles of the parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> and people of <HI>France,</HI> during the minority of this present king, to recover their lost liberties, shew the precarious state of despotic monarchs. When <HI>Germany</HI> was exposed to unspeakable miseries from the <HI>Hungarians, Sclavo|nians, Vandals</HI> and <HI>Danes,</HI> the remedy was establish|ing frequent and annual diets by the golden bull, under <HI>Charles</HI> IV, wherein the imperial cities and Hanse

towns took care to send new deputies to every new diet, lest they should be bribed by the imperial mini|sters. <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Switzerland,</HI> though improve|able in many points, are very careful on this head, and by the frequency of the assemblies of their states, have been secure.</P>

<P>Dr. <HI>South</HI> gave out his text, <Q>The word of the Devil, which I would recommend to your serious attention at this time, is written in the IId chapter of <HI>Iob,</HI> and the 4th verse,
"All that a man hath will he give for his life," </Q>
&amp;c. The jacobites moved, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1693, for a place-bill, and short parliaments. And there were men, who, in the apostle <HI>Paul</HI>'s time, preached <HI>Christ</HI> from contention. But truth is truth, if the Devil had spoke it, and christianity is a good religion, though some have preached it from conten|tion. So a place-bill, and short parliaments are salu|tary measures, though the jacobites proposed them from party-views. The former was passed by the commons, but rejected by the lords; the latter passed both houses, but was denied the royal assent. The lords threw out the bill for incapacitating placemen from sitting in the house, because it would seem too great a restraint on the people's liberty of choice. But this is a frivolous objection. For as the law stands now, the people are <HI>restrained</HI> from chusing
<PB N="113" REF="013851_0143_0F9E2B3F5BD722E0">
persons unqualified as to fortune, and those who hold certain places; and all the evil is, that the people are not more restrained in their choice of improper persons.</P>
<P><Q>Acts of parliament derogatory from the power of subsequent parliaments, bind not,</Q>
says <HI>Blackstone</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">COMM. I.90.</NOTE>. Therefore short parliaments are desirable. It is impos|sible, in many cases, to foresee what the effect and operation of an act of parliament will prove. And if a bad law must continue in force seven years (the same parliament will not perhaps like to repeal its own law) the subjects may be heavy sufferers.</P>
<P>The length of parliaments dejects the spirits of the few patriots who are still left. At the sitting down of a new parliament they lose all hope of redress, for many years. And the depression of their courage is the triumph of the court, and gives them opportu|nity for rivetting the chain.</P>
<P>If our parliaments were annual, it might be as well, that our ministries, and the rest of the execu|tive, were more permanent. For an honest parlia|ment (and an annual parliament, with exclusion by rotation, could have no interest to be other than honest) would oblige the executive to act according to justice, and the public interest, which would secure the pub|lic safety. The reducing our parliaments to indepen|dency on the court, would confound the enemies of this country. For it would shew the world, that the court had no indirect designs. And no nation can hope to injure <HI>Britain,</HI> if her government is true to her.</P>
<P><HI>Walpole, A. D.</HI> 1735, when the house was moved about shortening parliaments said, It would be dan|gerous; for that it would make the government demo|cratical by giving factious men too much game to
<PB N="114" REF="013851_0144_0F9E2B4012BD12C8">
play. This was truly <HI>Walpolian,</HI> that is jesuitical, reasoning. In whose hands ought the power to be? In those of a corrupt <HI>court?</HI> will it be safer there than in the hands of the original proprietors, I mean the <HI>people?</HI> Is the court likely to consult the people's interest with more diligence and fidelity than the peo|ple themselves? The court may be rich, though the nation be ruined. But if the nation be ruined, what is to become of the people?</P>
<P>The unembarrassed modesty of a thorough-paced courtier sticks at nothing. <HI>Pelham</HI> formally sets him|self <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. XII.86.</NOTE> to prove (in opposition to the sense of all that ever thought, spoke, or wrote upon government) that
<Q>it is an advantage of our constitution, that a person, may be in a station of power his whole life, because the attachment of the people to their king and royal family, will <HI>always</HI> prevent any bad effects from his ambition, and the controul of a master, or sovereign,</Q>

[however corrupt the parliament may be] will <HI>always</HI> prevent his being guilty of very enor|mous practices, or will, at all times, even when he is in the zenith of his power, be able to discover and punish them, if he should.' But wise founders of states have generally thought prevention preferable to punishment; and have, therefore, made regulations for preventing the continuance of power too long in the same hands. And in spite of their utmost precau|tion, wicked ministers have often escaped.</P>
<P>It is observed, that the members are particularly careful of their conduct toward the end of a parlia|ment, with a view to their being re-elected. Does
<PB N="115" REF="013851_0145_0F9E2B40CEA8CAD8">
not this shew the advantage of short parliaments, and the frequent return of power into the hands of the people? If it be said, upon the plan of exclusion by rotation, and an effectual place-bill, gentlemen would not want to be re-elected, and therefore the shorten|ing of parliaments would not make them at all the more careful of their conduct; this is confessing all that is wanted, viz. That, if parliaments were upon a right foot, there would be no byass upon the minds of the members, to draw them away from their coun|try's interest; which they would naturally pursue, because their own is involved in it.</P>
<P>The place-bill has been repeatedly passed by the commons in consideration of an approaching general election, which shews plainly the advantage of short parliaments <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See REV. PLACE-BILL.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A motion was made, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1713, to address the queen that she would desire the duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to remove the pretender out of his dominions.

If there be not some necessity for this (which to me seems as rational as to say, there ought to be a check to prevent individuals from being too healthy, or too virtuous) I cannot see the solidity of that reasoning, which lays so much stress on the necessity of a balance, or equality of power among the three estates, or indeed (speculatively, or theoretically speaking) of a necessity of any more <HI>estates</HI> than one, viz. An ade|quate representation of the people, unchecked and uninfluenced by any thing, but the common interest; and that they appoint responsible men for the execu|tion of the laws made by them with the general ap|probation.

<P><Q>The antient custom (says <HI>Davenant</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">DAVEN. II.60.</NOTE>) in the mixed governments formed in these northern coun|tries (which will be the best model for them to fol|low) was, That national assemblies should be fre|quently called, and sent home as soon as the nation's business was dispatched. The wisdom of old times
<PB N="119" REF="013851_0149_0F9E2B462C6A8778">
did never think it convenient that one and the same assembly should sit <HI>many years</HI> brooding of faction. For it is in these continued sessions, where the skill is learnt of <HI>guiding,</HI> and <HI>being</HI> guided, where the youth is depraved, and old sinners hardened, where those parties are formed that give the cunning speak|ers so much weight and value, and where they can bring their subtlety and eloquence to market. And in former reigns, the departing from a principle so essential in its constitution, had like to have changed the whole face of the <HI>English</HI> government; for leeches and other blood-sucking worms are ingen|dered in standing pools; flowing waters do not cor|rupt or breed so many insects. The keeping a na|tional assembly long sitting debauches the gentry of a kingdom, and opens a way to offices of trust, not known among their ancestors; but when such assem|blies are called together to consult upon the difficul|ties of state, and are dissolved as soon as the public business is dispatched, the measures of the false poli|ticians become presently quite altered. They, who design to rise, must mount by other steps than for|merly. Intriguing, heading&punc; parties, running into factions, and sudden changing of sides will avail the busy men but little. A <HI>year</HI> or <HI>two</HI> is not sufficient to mould and fashion an assembly to their designs; every new sessions young gentlemen are sent up whom it is not so easy to corrupt; they can fix nothing where there is a perpetual flux and reflux of matter; it is like building on a quick sand. When such as intend to advance themselves in the world see all this, and that these assemblies are no more the field in which they can exercise their wicked arts with any advan|tage, they naturally fall into other methods, and are

<HI>honest</HI> of course, when it is no longer their <HI>interest</HI> to be otherwise. In such a constitution there is no need to silence troublesome and perplexing rhetoric with some good office, nor to buy off and reconcile at any rate, men of turbulent and ambitious spirits; and when it is not needful to hire people to save their own country, how much <HI>cheaper</HI> and more easy is govern|ment rendered to princes, who then have a free choice among their subjects to call whom they please into the service of the state? whereas otherwise their favours are confined to one narrow sphere; and as thereby their goodness is made more extensive, so the stations requiring abilities and experience must be <HI>better</HI> filled, when a court has not the <HI>necessity</HI> upon it to find out places for men rather than men that are fit for the places. In countries where this post, so essential to liberty, is thus preserved from corrup|tion, all matters relating either to war or peace, pub|lic revenues, or trade, will go on prosperously; and a national assembly so constituted will always produce wholesome laws, right administration, and a perpe|tual race of honest and able ministers.</Q></P>

And so far was the house of commons from relieving the people under this dread|ful distress, that they contributed all in their power to prevent even their cries and prayers from either approaching the throne or themselves. They passed a law, by which no man durst ask his neighbour to join him in a petition for relief to the king or either house of parliament.

<P>The king had rejected the bill

The speakers in the dialogue remark, that the mischiefs of <HI>Charles</HI> IId's and <HI>Iames</HI> IId's reign were occasioned, in great measure, by their refusing to call successive parliaments, and by continuing the same parliament for many years, to form them to a compliance with their designs of despotic power. They observe,
<Q>That from king <HI>William</HI>'s so|lemn and repeated <HI>assurances</HI> that he would put a stop to the arbitrary power exercised over the people, and parliament, and from his request to parliament, that they would make such an effectual provision for their fundamental laws and liberties, that they might never hereafter be in danger to be again invaded; there was
<PB N="123" REF="013851_0153_0F9E2B4910777058">
reason to expect, that the <HI>antient,</HI> legal course of <HI>annually-chosen</HI> parliaments would have been im|mediately restored, and the strongest fence made for that constitution, that the wisdom of the kingdom could have invented.</Q>
But the promoters of the revolution lost the opportunity.</P>
<P>Politicians have laid down for a maxim, That if kings were <HI>republican</HI> in their measures of administra|tion, subjects would be <HI>royalists</HI> in their obedience. Our kings have it in their own absolute power to do the nation a prodigious service. The king can dis|solve every parliament at the end of the first session; which would make parliaments annual. But this would be applying <HI>prerogative</HI> to the advantage of the <HI>people</HI>; whereas kings generally think it is in|tended for <HI>their</HI> advantage, and to keep the people down.

<PB N="124" REF="013851_0154_0F9E2B4A124A1930">
the people will, in that case, have no legal remedy, which is in itself contrary to the nature of govern|ment; it being ridiculous to imagine that the same law, which provides a remedy for every private wrong, should provide none for these of the public, or that the whole body of the people, for whose sake the law itself was instituted, should ever find them|selves in such circumstances, as to lose the benefit of it. Yet this must happen if it be received as a standing maxim of law and justice, that their repre|sentatives when once chosen for any number of years, have, notwithstanding the grossest misbehaviour, still a right to sit out their term, and what is worse to extend it as far as the affairs of the nation, or <HI>their own,</HI> may seem to require. If this be adm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, then no term can by law be prescribed to their sitting; because they have still a power by law of extending that term, and consequently of perpetuating them|selves. This, however improbable, must, upon a supposition of the legality of the first extension of the original term, be allowed to be equally legal. From hence it appears how dangerous it is to remove the corner stones of government; and that whenever they have been removed through necessity, the first op|portunity ought to be laid hold of to restore them to their former situation.</Q></P>

Men, who intended to sell their own votes within doors, spared no cost, to buy the votes of others in elections. But now it was hoped, we should see a golden age, wherein the characters men were in, and the reputation they had, would be the prevail|ing considerations in elections. And by this means it was hoped, that our constitution, in particular
<PB N="127" REF="013851_0157_0F9E2B4DB8CEA9E0">
that part of it, which related to the house of com|mons, would again recover its strength and repu|tation, which were now very much sunk. <Q>For cor|ruption was so generally spread, that it was believed, every thing was carried by that method.</Q></P>
<P>To these observations of the good bishop, I will add, That it is at no time easy to say what effect a <HI>partial</HI> reformation of abuses will produce. And the mere reducing of parliaments to triennial is surely a very partial correction. It is only stopping one leak in ten. For supposing parliaments were triennial, so long as a few thousands (instead of many hundred thousands) have the power of sending in a majority of the house, it will be in the power of the treasury to influence elections. And, so long as there is no penalty for sitting in the house of commons, and, at the same time, enjoying a place, or pension, so long there will be danger lost the votes of the members be influenced by a corrupt court. And so long as the same individuals may be returned again and again, without necessity of exclusion by rotation, so long it will be worth the ministry's while to influence them, and worth their while to bribe their electors. But, if parliaments were annual, with exclusion by rota|tion; if the power of electing were equally distri|buted, as it ought to be, among men of property, so that no one member could be elected by fewer than a majority of 800 votes; and if no member could hold a place, or pension, while he sat in the house of commons, under a severe penalty&mdash;if all these restorations of the constitution were brought about, I will engage, that court-influence in parliament shall be <HI>impossible</HI>; and then we shall see the golden days mentioned by the bishop.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="013851_0158_0F9E2B4EE83BBE60">Concerning triennial parliaments it was argued, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1693, That long parliaments might prove dangerous either to king or people; to the former by their obtaining great influence among the people, and retrenching too much the power of the crown. But this I think frivolous, because history has no example of a crown, whose power was too much retrenched. And besides it is most likely that a <HI>short</HI> parliament will retrench prerogative. That long parliaments may be likely to prove dangerous to the people, is extremely natural. For power becoming inveterate in the hands of any set of men is always dangerous. When a court knows, that the same set of men are likely to be in parliament for seven, fourteen, or twenty one years, it becomes worth while to practise upon them; and a wicked court may influence a corrupt parliament to give up, says <HI>Burnet</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">HIST. OWN TIMES, III.147.</NOTE>, all the money and all the liberties of <HI>England,</HI> when they are to have a large share of the money, and are to be made instru|ments of tyranny.'
<Q>Frequent parliaments would like|wise, says the same author, put an end to the great expence, candidates put themselves to in elections, and would oblige the members to behave themselves so well, both with relation to the public, and in their private deportment, as to recommend them to their electors at the three years end; whereas, when a parliament is to fit many years, the members covered with privileges, are apt to take great liber|ties, to forget, that they represent others, and to take care only of themselves.</Q>
<HI>Burnet</HI> mentions some objectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s then made to frequent elections, as,
<Q>That they would make the freeholders proud, and inso|lent, when they knew, that application must be
<PB N="129" REF="013851_0159_0F9E2B4F1EBF5A68">
made to them at the end of three years. This would establish a faction in every body of men, who had a right to election; and whereas now an election puts men to a great charge all at once, then the charge must be perpetual all the three years, in lay|ing in for a new election, when it was known, how soon it would come round.</Q>
But surely we cannot do much, if we cannot get over such frivolous objec|tions as these. As to the pride and insolence, which the power of frequent elections would produce in the freeholders, it is nothing to the purpose. We are not to deprive the freeholders of what is otherwise their just <HI>right,</HI> because their possessing of it may make them <HI>proud.</HI> On that principle, they must not have their estates, at least none must have considerable estates. And, above all, we must have no bishops, peers, or kings. And as to faction's being likely to be increased by shortening parliaments, it is more likely to confound faction. The very support of faction is power continued long in the same hands. And as to the increase of expence to members in con|sequence of short parliaments, it is an objection set upon its head. For, if parliaments were annual, with exclusion of two thirds for three years by rotation, there would be at once an end put to packing, brib|ing, canvassing, electioneering, placing, and pension|ing of parliament-men; because the parliament, never consisting wholly of the same men for two years together, it would not be worth while for the court to get their iniquitous schemes carried in parliament, only to remain for <HI>one</HI> year, and be overthrown the next; and whenever a seat in the house came to be no longer a matter of emolument, the contest would be (as now with respect to parish-officers in <HI>England,</HI>

and seats in the assemblies in <HI>America</HI>) how to <HI>avoid</HI> being elected.</P>
<P>The people's right of annually electing deputies to represent them in parliament was, at the time of the triennial act, as much a part of their birthright, as the freedom of their persons. They had enjoyed it longer than <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> without violation, till the times of <HI>Charles</HI> I. It was therefore no more in the power of any single king and parliament to deprive the people of this right, than of <HI>Magna Charta.</HI> And the people have now a right, at any time, to resume their original power, and to elect only for one year, declaring, that they will not yield obedience to one act made in a <HI>second</HI> year of the same parliament.</P>
<P>The only plausible pretence for septennial parlia|ments, viz. the danger of a jacobite parliament's being chosen, never was solid; because, on that principle, parliaments should have been still <HI>longer</HI> than septen|nial, that is, there should have been no new parlia|ment called, while there was a considerable body of jacobites in the nation. But if the pretence for sep|tennial parliaments had been ever so plausible, at the time of that fatal innovation, in the name of common sense, what has that to do with <HI>our</HI> times?</P>
<P>It was proposed to address for frequent new parlia|ments, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1675, in the house of peers. It was urged that parliaments both before and long after the conquest, were held 3 times a year, viz. at <HI>Easter, Whitsuntide,</HI> and <HI>Christmas,</HI> 8 days, each time <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. Lords, I.175.</NOTE>. This continued with some variations till <HI>Edward</HI> III. Then parlia|ments were appointed to be annual, or oftener, if need be,

It was unreasonable, that the same man should <HI>engross</HI> legislative power, and <HI>exclude</HI> so many others equally entitiled. <HI>Change</HI> of hands was useful to keep those intrusted to their <HI>duty.</HI> A member may be chosen when in <HI>good</HI> circumstances.

At any rate a place-man is not as free as he who has nothing from the court. <HI>Hono|res mutant mores.</HI>
<Q>The commons are now become judges of their own privileges, condemning and imprisoning their fellow subjects</Q>
[their constituents, their <HI>masters</HI>]
<Q>at pleasure, and without oath; they are judges of all elections, by which means very often <HI>they,</HI> and not the <HI>people,</HI> chuse their fellow members. This is owing to the length of parlia|ments. Long parliaments give time for settling cabals and schemes of corruption. The nation was therefore much obliged to the long pensioned parlia|ment for not enslaving it. How easily this may be done in future ages, under such princes and long par|liaments, may easily be conjectured <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 180.</NOTE>.

The address was however carried in the negative. Several lords protested, and the king came to prorogue the house before all the lords who intended to join in the pro|test, were come to the house <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 175.</NOTE>.</P>

He then goes on to shew, that, as members are de|legated by electors, to supply their places, and do their business for them, they ought not to be con|tinued longer than a year; because circumstances may so change in a year, that a member who was <HI>fit</HI> for the business in agitation, when he was chosen, may be found very <HI>ill</HI> qualified for judging of what comes before parliament, the following sessions; yet the electors have no opportunity of changing h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m for a more proper deputy.

<P><PB N="133" REF="013851_0163_0F9E2B526DD6AE20">When the septennial bill was proposed, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1716, it was pretended, that the people were very generally disaffected, though the rebellion was quel|led; and that the hopes of the jacobites were founded on a new parliament. It was proposed first, to sus|pend the triennial act for once, which would have continued the parliament three years longer. It was questioned whether the septennial bill should be set on foot in the house of lords or commons. It was thought best it should be started in the lords house, where the triennial originated; that the odium might not fall upon the commons so as to hinder their elections. Triennial elections (they said) keep up party divisions, raise animosities in families, occasion ruinous expences, &amp;c. The only pretence for lengthening parliaments, was the jacobitism of the people, which was owing to the mad cry of <HI>The church in danger,</HI> set up by the bigotted <HI>priesthood.</HI>
<Q>Tantum relligio potuit suadere malorum.</Q>
Could they not see that the contest about elections was owing to the posts and places? Why did they not abolish them, as in <HI>Holland?</HI> The whigs made a point of carrying the bill, and every opposer of it was to be set down for a tory. The triennial act, when passed, was looked upon by the people as their great security. Why therefore did the people's deputies dare to mention the repeal of it? It had made king <HI>William</HI> supremely popular. The septennial bill was taking the election fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the people, and electing themselves for four years. Parliaments ought not to be altered from what was the known intention of the electors, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hout new authority obtained from the electors. But that they did not ask; well knowing they should not obtain it. The expence of frequent
<PB N="134" REF="013851_0164_0F9E2B52E3ECF1F8">
elections was no argument, because these expences are voluntary. Frequent elections, it was said, pro|duced corruption, [the contrary is the truth, their consciences told them] and corruption produced the parliament which approved the peace of <HI>Utrecht.</HI> [If corruption does mischief, the business is to remove the materials of corruption. The cause abolished, the effects will cease of course.] Lord <HI>Trevor</HI> said, the shortest parliaments were the best, and that annual was the constitutional period. That parliaments were longest in the worst times, and when the revolution came in, which brought liberty, with it came short parliaments. It was very necessary, he said, to make regulations for preventing parliaments making en|croachments on the constitution, as well as for re|straining ministerial encroachments. If the people were disaffected and discontented, whether would the lengthening of parliaments <HI>conciliate,</HI> or <HI>widen</HI> the breach? There is no representative of the people but a house, of their <HI>own</HI> making. Every election, supposing representation adequate, and places out of the way, throws the government again into the hands of the people, where it must always be safe. It is absurd to alledge, that foreign states could not trust us, if our parliaments were shortened. What more <HI>permanent</HI> than the <HI>French</HI> court? But who <HI>trusts</HI> the <HI>French</HI> court? Let <HI>property</HI> govern, and all will be safe, and universal <HI>confidence</HI> will follow. A long parlia|ment made <HI>Charles</HI> II. indifferent about the affec|tions of his people. The lengthening of parliaments tended to produce faction in foreign states, when they saw how easily the <HI>British</HI> constitution might be broke into. It was therefore observed in the house of peers, that to publish the prevalency of a popish faction in <HI>Britain,</HI> and to tell foreigners, that the people were
<PB N="135" REF="013851_0165_0F9E2B53B87D2E80">
not to be trusted with themselves, was confounding all confidence of foreign states in this nation. Articles in the lords protest against committing, were,
<Q>That frequent new parliaments are required by the consti|tution of this kingom, and the practice of many ages evidences this to be the constitution. That long par|liaments naturally increase corruption. The longer the time, the more worth a corrupt minister's while to bribe, and the more worth a candidate's to get in|to the house.</Q>
Thirty lords protested against com|mitting the bill, and afterwards 24 against passing it. Petitions were presented to the commons against it from <HI>Hastings, Marlborough, Cambridge,</HI> and <HI>Abing|don.</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tind.</HI> I&punc; 490.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the same debate in the house of peers, the duke of <HI>Devonshire,</HI> in favour of the bill, laboured to set forth the inconveniencies attending triennial parlia|ments, that they served to produce feuds, animosi|ties, party-divisions, expensive elections,' with the other trite stuff commonly urged on that side of the question. On the contrary, lord <HI>Abingdon</HI> said, the people looked upon the triennial act, as the great security of their rights and liberties; that if the bill passed the commons, it would be looked upon by those they represented, as a breach of trust. The duke of <HI>Kingstone</HI> denied the last part of this assertion, and urged that the business of the legislature was to rectify old laws, as well as to make new ones. Lord <HI>Paulet</HI> said, he did not think it for the king's service, and interest; but before they went any farther, they ought to know the sentiments of the <HI>people.</HI> His lordship urged that the bill shewed a distrust of the affections of the people, without which no king could be safe or happy; that king <HI>William</HI> had gained the
<PB N="136" REF="013851_0166_0F9E2B54A3662628">
hearts of his people by the triennial act; and it would look somewhat strange, that the most <HI>popular</HI> of our laws should be repealed in a year after the <HI>protestant</HI> succession took place.</P>
<P>The earl of <HI>Peterborough</HI> said, He wished he could give his vote for the bill; but that he could not be for a remedy that might cause a greater evil; and that if this present parliament continued beyond the time for which they were chosen, he knew not how to express the manner of their existence, (unless begging leave of the venerable bench, turning to the bishops) he had recourse to the distinction used in the <HI>Athanasian</HI> creed, for they would neither be <HI>made</HI> nor <HI>created,</HI> but <HI>proceeding.</HI></P>
<P>The earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> was against the bill, because he thought it would rather exasperate, than quiet the minds of the people; and that though he could not assign the true cause of the people's dissatisfaction&punc; yet there must have been some secret cause for it: That he hoped people's discontent was not so great, as had been represented; that this bill seemed to imply that the affections of the people were confined to so small a number as the present house of commons; that whatever reasons may be given for continuing this parliament for four years longer, would be at least as strong, (and by the conduct of the ministry might be made much stronger) for continuing it still longer, and even for perpetuating it; which would be an ab|solute <HI>subversion</HI> of the third estate of the realm. He then hinted at the danger of enlarging the <HI>prerogative,</HI> and instanced in the precedent of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who persuaded his parliament to give him the abbey-lands under pretence that they would bear part of his expences, which would ease them of taxes, and im|prove
<PB N="137" REF="013851_0167_0F9E2B55170612D0">
trade; but that soon after he demanded, and obtained, great subsidies, and made use of those lands to <HI>enslave</HI> the people.</P>
<P>The duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> said, that designs had been laid to bring in the pretender, long before the king's happy accession to the throne; and that if the conspi|rators had improved the ferment, at the election of the last parliament, it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s probable their wicked schemes for setting aside the protestant succession had taken place.</P>
<P>The bishop of <HI>London</HI> said, he was confounded between danger and inconveniences on one side, and destruction on the other. After a debate of five hours the question being put, it was carried in the affirmative, 24 lords protesting against passing the bill,
<Q>Because fre|quent parliaments were the fundamental constitution of the kingdom&punc; Because the house of commons ought to be chosen by the <HI>people</HI>; and when continued for a longer time, than they were chosen for, they were then chosen by the <HI>parliament,</HI> and not by the people. They conceived that the bill, so far from prevent|ing corruption, would rather increase it; for the longer a parliament was to last, the more valuable, to corruptors, would be the purchase. And that all the reasons that had been given for long parliaments, might be given for making them perpetual, which would be an absolute subversion of the third estate <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, III.27.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In the same debate in the house of commons the court-members said, the septennial bill would strengthen the hands of the king; settle and maintain the protestant succession; encourage our allies to depend upon us, that what shall hereafter be stipulated shall be performed;
<PB N="138" REF="013851_0168_0F9E2B56DD953248">
would break our parties and divisions, and lay a solid foundation for future happiness. And since the pre|sent parliament have exerted themselves for the public good, why should they not continue longer together, that they may finish what is so happily begun?</P>
<P>The opposition denied
<Q>that the people were dis|affected, said the parliament, that had done so great things, were but little more than a year old, and that nobody could imagine that discontents (if there were any) would last the remainder of their term, under so wise, so unerring, so pacific an admini|stration as they then enjoyed. Was the frame of our constitution to be altered, before our allies would favour us with their friendship? That was an argu|ment very improper to be urged in a <HI>British</HI> parlia|ment. It was acknowledging, that the king dares not trust the people in a new choice. It is a dis|honour to this house; for it supposes that another house of commons would act differently from the present, which is to confess, that this house does not truly represent the people. The trust, they said, was triennial; and if it was continued longer, from that instant they ceased to be the trustees of the people, from that instant they acted by an assumed power and erected a new constitution; and though it is a received maxim, That the <HI>supreme</HI> legislature cannot be <HI>bound,</HI> yet it must be under|stood that it was restrained from subverting the foundations on which <HI>itself</HI> stood. And now after above an hundred millions given by the people, in order to preserve their old form of government, a bill is sent from the lords, which if it passes, must expose us again to the <HI>greatest</HI> of dangers, which is that of a <HI>long</HI> parliament. In the pensioned parliament,
<PB N="139" REF="013851_0169_0F9E2B58028537C8">
the means of temptation in the minister's hands were not so great as they now are; the civil list nigh <HI>double</HI> to what it then was; and the depen|dence on the crown greatly enlarged by reason of the increase of <HI>officers</HI> for managing the public funds. What influence these may have upon an exhausted nation, under the terror which 40,000 regular troops carry with them, is easily foreseen. Can the lords think us so ungrateful, as to join in the destruction of the power that raised us; and why cannot we con|tent ourselves with proceeding in the common me|thods, which the usage of many ages justifies?</Q></P>
<P>It was resolved however, 284 against 162, that the bill be committed.</P>
<P>What follows is taken from <HI>Hutcheson</HI>'s speeches on the same occasion <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. VI. Append. 1&mdash;32.</NOTE>.
<Q>If we should give our con|sent to the passing of the bill before us into a law, we should be guilty of a most notorious breach of the trust reposed in us, by those who sent us hither, and should make a very dangerous step towards the undermining of that constitution, which our ances|tors have been so careful to preserve, and thought no expence either of blood or treasure too much for that purpose, and under which we do yet enjoy those privileges and advantages, which no other nation in the world can at this day boast of. It must be agreed, that before the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. there was no single instance of a prorogation of parliament. That parliaments had only one session, and those ge|nerally very short ones, none of which ever lasted a year. That to prevent the mischief of long inter|vals of parliament, it was enacted, in the 4th of
<PB N="140" REF="013851_0170_0F9E2B58157B92A0">
<HI>Edward</HI> III. that parliaments should be holden an|nually; and this was confirmed by subsequent acts of parliament. And therefore I may venture to affirm, that by the antient constitution, parliaments were to be holden frequently, and to be of the continuance only of one session, and that there was no right or power in the crown to prorogue the same. I wish gentlemen would as generally concur that the other part which I have mentioned, and I think have made appear to have been our antient constitution, is as absolutely necessary to the preservation of our li|berties, I mean parliaments of one session, not only frequent parliaments, but frequent <HI>new</HI> parliaments. The thing indeed appears very evident to me, so evident that in my opinion our liberties would not be more, nay not so precarious under an <HI>absolute</HI> mo|narch, as with a house of commons who had a right to sit either for many years together, or without any limitation of time. For 'tis certain that a prince, who had stood only on the bottom of his own abso|lute authority, supported by a few ministers, and some troops, would still think himself pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tty much upon his good behaviour towards the united body of his people; and would probably be cautious of ex|erting his power in such a manner as to give a just provocation to a general revolt, and setting up another in his stead; but a prince, with a <HI>parliament</HI> at his devotion, would be infinitely more terrible, and with much greater security might give a loose to every ex|travagancy of power; for when the representatives of the people, who are chosen by them to be the <HI>guar|dians</HI> of their liberties, can be prevailed on, for little advantages to themselves, to <HI>betray</HI> their trust, and
<PB N="141" REF="013851_0171_0F9E2B58DC8CD298">
come into all the measures of a designing ministry; 'tis then, indeed, that the liberties of a people are in the most imminent danger; and surely there is great reason to apprehend that a house of commons might soon become very obsequious to a minister, if they were to sit for a long period, or without limi|tation, and that there were in view no <HI>near</HI> day of a <HI>new</HI> election, when the conduct of gentlemen in this place would be inquired into in their respective countries. I remember very well, what an outcry was rais<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d against the last parliament, on suspicion only that a repeal of the triennial act was intended; and the arguments against it without doors, were then the very same with those which are now urged a|gainst it within: what an inconsistency must it then appear to see those very gentlemen, who were then the most zealous opposers of such an attempt, be|come now the most violent advocates for it! And will it not also in some measure affect their integrity, publicly to own that the arguments they pretended to be then influenced by, had not the least weight with them; and that the thing in itself was very desirable when there should be a good ministry and parliament in being, and pernicious only in the then situation of affairs? It was not certainly from this consideration that the late ministry and parliament were diverted from the attempt: they doubtless had a very good opinion of themselves, and were confirmed therein by the voice of a great majority of the people; and which, by a most strange and unaccountable witch|craft, still continues in their favour; if I may depend upon what several who have argued for the bill seem to have agreed to <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P><Q>As bribery and corruption, says Mr. <HI>Wynne,</HI> in the same debate, is a natural consequence of long parliaments, as it must always increase in proportion as the term for the parliament's continuance is pro|longed, I am persuaded that all those who are against bribery and corruption will join with me in voting for the restitution of triennial parliaments. It is
<PB N="143" REF="013851_0173_0F9E2B5A54960500">
not the <HI>expence</HI> of an election that country gentle|men are to be afraid of; the most extravagant enter|tainments, that a stranger in the country could give, would have but little weight, if to these he did not add downright <HI>bribery</HI>; and even then bribes must be so high as to overballance the natural interest of the country gentlemen, as well as the honesty of the greatest part of the electors: as these bribes cannot be made so high for a triennial parliament, as they may for a septennial, they cannot be so prevalent among the electors; and therefore a gentleman, who de|pends upon nothing but his <HI>natural</HI> interest, will always have a better chance for representing his country in a triennial parliament than he can have in one which is to continue for seven years; for which reason I cannot but think that any gentleman who has a mind that his posterity shall depend for their seats in parliament upon the natural interest they may have in their respective countries, and not upon the frowns or the favours of the ministers for the time being, must necessarily be for our returning to our former constitution in this respect. This, Sir, is in my opinion absolutely necessary; and it must be done soon, otherwise country gentlemen, tired out with contending against those who purchase their elections, perhaps with the <HI>very money</HI> which the country gentlemen are obliged to pay out of their estates in public <HI>duties</HI> and <HI>taxes,</HI> will at last have nothing to do but to sit down and bemoan the fate of their country: but the complaints will then be to very little purpose: for the doors of that place where the groans of the people ought to be heard, will then be shut against them: we may depend on it, that those who obtain their seats in this house by

ministerial influence, will, while here, be directed in all their proceedings by the same sort of influence, and by none other <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. VIII.169.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ever since we have had <HI>septennial</HI> parliaments, our elections have been generally attended with distractions and <HI>confusions</HI>; but I cannot allow, that this would be the case if they were <HI>annual,</HI> or even triennial: and I would gladly ask gentlemen, if before that time it was ever known that the solicitations and conten|tions about elections began <HI>two</HI> years before the chus|ing of a new parliament, which is known to be the case at present over the whole kingdom, and which always must necessarily be the case; it being natural for men to contend with more vigour and heat for a post either of honour or profit, that is to be en|joyed for <HI>seven</HI> years, than for one that is to be held but for <HI>one,</HI> or for three. Then, Sir, as to the bribery and corruption at elections, I am sure it has very much increased since the septennial law took place. It is a natural consequence of lengthening the time of a parliament's continuance; a conse|quence so natural, that I am surprized to find it so much mistaken as it seems to be by some gentle|men who have spoken upon the other side of the question. It is certain, Sir, that <HI>bribery</HI> will never be made use of at any election, but by a man who has not a sufficient <HI>natural</HI> interest in the place where he declares himself a candidate; and by such we may expect it will always be made use of, as far as it can be done with safety, if the candidate has but the least hopes of succeeding by such dishonourable means. Where there happens a competition, every elector has a natural byass to vote for one man rather
<PB N="145" REF="013851_0175_0F9E2B5D29096AB8">
than another. And every elector will vote accord|ing to his natural byass, if he is not bought off. Whoever endeavours to buy him off, must certainly come up to his price; and this price will be higher or lower according to the elector's honour and circum|stances, and the natural byass he has for the other can|didate. A great many men may be perhaps bought off with 100 or 1000 guineas, who if <HI>half</HI> that sum were offered would spurn it away with an <HI>honest</HI> dis|dain. I hope, Sir, there are a great many electors in this kingdom, whose honour upon such occa|sions, is above the power of any such corrupt temp|tations: but that there are likewise a great many who may be bought, is a fact which I believe no gentleman in this house will dispute; and in this view let us examine the difference between triennial and septennial parliaments. Give me leave then to suppose two gentlemen set up in opposition to each other for representing one of our little boroughs in parliament; one of them a country gentleman of a great natural interest in the place; the other a citi|zen of <HI>London,</HI> or a placeman not near equal to him in interest; but depending entirely upon the money he is able to lay out. Suppose the citizen or place|man comes to a calculation, and finds that it will cost him at least 3000<HI>l.</HI> to buy the country gentle|man out of his interest in that borough; if the par|liament were to continue but for three years, he would very probably resolve not to be at such an expence, and so would refrain from being guilty of the crime of corrupting his countrymen; but when the parliament is to continue for seven years, he may as probably resolve to be at that charge. Thus by corruption he may get a seat in this house, and it
<PB N="146" REF="013851_0176_0F9E2B5E10EB9E88">
is to be feared that he, who comes in by corruption, will not walk out with clean hands. Gentlemen are very much mistaken if they imagine that the price of an elector depends upon the duration of a parliament, or that a man who sells his vote for 100 guineas at an election for a septennial parliament, would sell his vote for the half of that sum, if the parliament to be chosen were to continue only for three years. No, Sir, there are very few of this sort of electors who think of futurity; the <HI>present</HI> offer is the temptation, and the only temptation which can be of any weight with them. Besides, they can|not depend upon having the like offer made them at the next election; and 50 guineas ready money with an. <HI>uncertain</HI> hope of having 50 more three years hence, is not surely, so great a price, as 100 guineas <HI>ready down.</HI> The natural interest of the country gentleman, and the honour of the electors, are what the dealers in corruption have to contend with; and against these a small price cannot be so prevalent as one a little higher. Some may perhaps be corrupted by a small price; but certainly the <HI>higher</HI> it is, the greater will the <HI>numbers</HI> be that are tempted to yield to it; and as a man may give a higher price at the election for a septennial parliament than he can do at one for an annual or triennial, therefore the greater the numbers will be of those who yield to his temp|tation, the more he may depend upon corruption; and the more it is to be depended on, the more general and the more frequent will it certainly be. From hence it appears evident, that the <HI>increase</HI> of bribery and corruption is as natural a consequence of septennial parliaments, as any one thing can be con|ceived to be the consequence of another. There is no way, Sir, of effectually preventing corruption,
<PB N="147" REF="013851_0177_0F9E2B5EF23ECB00">
but by putting it out of the <HI>power</HI> of any man to corrupt: there is no corrupting any man but by com|ing up to his price; therefore the only way of put|ting it out of the power of any man to corrupt, is to put it out of the power of any man to come up to the price of any number of electors; and this can only be done by making our elections frequent: the more frequent, the better. It is certain, a gentle|man, who enjoys a good pension for seven years, is more able to give a high price, than if he had en|joyed that pension but for one year or even for three; and he will more willingly give a high price, when he is thereby to purchase the continuance of the pen|sion for seven, than for one, or for three. This, Sir, is so evident, that I am astonished to hear it contro|verted within these walls. If our parliaments were annual, it would be impossible for place-men or pen|sioners to save as much <HI>yearly</HI> as would be sufficient to bribe country gentlemen out of their interest, and the electors out of their honesty, which I am afraid is a practice now too frequent in many parts of this kingdom. How can it otherwise be imagined, the people would chuse persons they never saw, persons they perhaps <HI>never heard of,</HI> in opposition to gentle|men who live in the <HI>neighbourhood</HI>; gentlemen who give them daily employment, by buying in their shops and markets all the manufactures and provisions they have use for in their families, and gentlemen whose ancestors have perhaps often represented that very place in parliament with great honour and uni|versal approbation?</Q></P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Wyndham,</HI> in the same debate, shews the evil of long parliaments in <HI>one</HI> view as follows. <Q>Let us suppose a gentleman at the <HI>head</HI> of the <HI>ad|ministration,</HI> whose only safety depends upon cor|rupting
<PB N="148" REF="013851_0178_0F9E2B6044074FA0">
the members of this house.</Q> This may now be only a supposition, but it is certainly such a one as may happen; and if ever it should, let us see whether such a minister might not promise himself more suc|cess in a septennial than he could in a triennial par|liament. It is an old maxim, That every man has his price, if you can but come up to it. This I hope does not hold true of every man; but I am afraid it too generally holds true; and that of a great many it may hold true, is what I believe was never <HI>doubted</HI> of; though I don't know but it may now be <HI>denied:</HI> however let us suppose this distressed minister applying to one of those men who has a price, and is a member of this house. In order to engage this member to vote as he shall direct him, he offers him a pension of 1000<HI>l.</HI> a year: if it be but a triennial parliament, will not the member immediately con|sider thus within himself, if I accept of this pension, and vote according to direction, I shall lose my <HI>cha|racter</HI> in the country; I shall lose my seat in parlia|ment the next election, and my pension will then of course be at an end; so that by turning <HI>rogue</HI> I shall get but 3000<HI>l.</HI> This is not <HI>worth</HI> my <HI>while.</HI> And so the minister must either offer him perhaps the double of that sum, or otherwise he will probably determine against being corrupted. But if the parliament were septennial, the same man might perhaps say within himself, I am now in for seven years. By accepting of this pension I shall have at least 7000<HI>l.</HI> This will set me above contempt; and If I am turned out at next election, I do not value it. I'll take the money in the mean time. Is it not very natural to suppose all this, Sir? And does not this evidently shew that a wicked minister cannot corrupt a triennial parliament
<PB N="149" REF="013851_0179_0F9E2B604F32DE80">
with the same money as he may a septennial? Again, suppose this minister applies to a gentleman who has purchased, and thereby made himself member for a borough at the rate of perhaps 1500<HI>l.</HI> besides travel|ing charges and other little expences: suppose the minister offers him a pension of 500<HI>l.</HI> a year to en|gage his vote; will not he naturally consider if it be a triennial parliament, that if he cannot get a higher pension, he will lose money by being a mem|ber; and surely if he be a right burgess, he will resolve not to sell at all, rather than sell his com|modity for less than it cost him; and if he finds he cannot sell at all, he will probably give over stand|ing a candidate again upon such a footing; by which not only he but many others will be induced to <HI>give over</HI> dealing in corrupting the electors at the next election. But if it be a septennial parliament, will he not then probably accept of the 500<HI>l.</HI> pension, if he be one of those men that has a price? Will he not conclude, that for 1500<HI>l.</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">All articles are enhanced in their prices. There are no boroughs to be had for 1500<HI>l.</HI> in our times.</NOTE> he may always secure his election, and every parliament will put near 2000<HI>l.</HI> in his pocket, besides reimbursing him all his charges.</P>
<P>After viewing the present question in this light, is it possible, Sir, not to conclude that septennial par|liaments, as well as the elections for them, must al|ways be much more liable to be influenced by cor|ruption, than triennial, or the elections for them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>' Afterwards he goes on as follows:</P>
<P>Suppose, Sir, that the generality of the electors in <HI>England</HI> have virtue enough to withstand a temp|tation of 5 guineas each, but not enough to resist
<PB N="150" REF="013851_0180_0F9E2B61115E2AC0">
the force of 10 guineas, one with another: is it not then much more probable that the gentlemen who deal in corruption may be able to raise as much money once every seven years as will be sufficient to give 10 guineas each one with another to the generality of the electors, than that they will be able to raise such a sum once in every three years. And is it not from thence certain, that the virtue of the people in general is in greater danger of being destroyed by septennial than by triennial parliaments? To sup|pose, Sir, that every man's vote at an election is like a commodity, which must be sold at the market|price, is really to suppose that no man has any vir|tue at all: for I will aver, that when once a man resolves to sell his vote at any rate, he has then no virtue left; which I hope is not the case of many of our electors; and therefore the only thing we are to apprehend is lest so high a price should be offered as may tempt thousands to sell who had never be|fore any thoughts of carrying such a commodity to market. This, Sir, is the fatal event we are to dread, and is much more to be dreaded from septen|nial than from triennial parliaments. If we have therefore any desire to preserve the virtue of our people; if we have any desire to preserve our consti|tution; if we have any desire to preserve our liber|ties, our properties, and every thing that can be dear to a free people, we ought to restore the trien|nial law; and if that be found too insignificant&punc; we ought to abolish prorogations, and return to annual elections.&mdash;Afterwards he adds what follows;</P>
<P><Q>The crown, either by ill management or by pro|digality and profuseness to its favourites, has spent or granted away all its estates, and the public ex|pence
<PB N="151" REF="013851_0181_0F9E2B61E7BCD230">
is so much enlarged, that the crown must have annual supplies, and is therefore under a necessity of having the parliament meet every year; but as new elections are always dangerous, as well as trouble|some to the ministers of state, they are for having them as seldom as possible; so that the complaint is not now for want of frequent meetings or <HI>sessions</HI> of parliament, but against having the <HI>same</HI> parlia|ment continued too long. This is the grievance now complained of; this is what the people want redressed; it is what they have a right to have re|dressed. The members of parliament may for one year be looked on as the real and true representa|tives of the people; but when a minister has seven years to practise upon them, and to feel their pulses, they may be induced to forget whose representatives they are; they may throw of all dependance upon their electors, and may become dependants upon the crown, or rather upon the minister for the time being <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. VIII.193.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Sir <HI>I. St. Aubyn</HI> observed, in the same debate, that parliaments were generally annual, but never longer than triennial, till <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. (an obstinate tyrant, who broke through all the laws of God and man, when they stood in the way of his ambition, avarice, or lust) introduced long parliaments, as proper means for enslaving the nation. Sir <HI>Iohn</HI> gives an account much too favourable of <HI>Ch.</HI> Ist's character, and of his hatred to parliaments. <HI>Ch.</HI> II. would have laid parliaments aside; but could not. Therefore he con|trived to debauch them. And his long pensioned-parliament will be infamous through all ages.
<Q>It
<PB N="152" REF="013851_0182_0F9E2B6291581428">
was the model,</Q>
says Sir <HI>Iohn,</HI> from which, I believe, some later parliaments have been exactly copied.' At the revolution, the people claimed their antient right. The triennial law was then estalished. The septennial law was intended only as a preservative against a temporary inconvenience. The inconveni|ence being removed, the remedy, which was itself an evil, and a violation of the constitution, ought to be removed, and the constitution restored. Long par|liaments become independent on the people, and de|pendent on the court. If the members are to deny all power in the people to instruct them, and are to sit seven years together voting as they please, in spite of the people, how are they a representative of the people? And if they may sit seven years, though the people have commissioned them only for three, why may they not make themselves perpetual, like the lords, and set the people aside? The power of the crown is always increasing. Therefore members ought to come frequently into the power of their con|stituents, that they may be kept under the constant awe of acting contrary to their interest. Dangerous attempts on liberty have been prevented by the ap|proach of a general election. Which shews the ad|vantage of short parliaments, which would occasion general elections to be always near. Long parlia|ments are an unjust exclusion of a great number of gentlemen of property, who ought to have their turn in serving their country. Frequent new parliaments would be great advantage to our kings. Were par|liaments annual, a king might, in the course of 28 years, have the advice of 28 gentlemen, where now he has only that of four. Short parliaments have always been less corrupt than long ones; because a minister
<PB N="153" REF="013851_0183_0F9E2B634E9A0598">
must have time to lay his plans of operation, and erect his batteries against the virtue of the members, and men are not immediately debauched. Besides, the shorter parliaments are, the less it is worth a minister's while to bribe the members, for votes in the house; because the shorter time his iniquitous schemes can stand securely if he gains them. And this must of course <HI>lessen</HI> the expences, the animosities, and the corrupt proceedin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of elections. Long parliaments <HI>first</HI> introduced bribery because they we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e <HI>worth</HI> pur|chasing at any rate; country gentlemen who have only their private fortunes to rely upon, and have no mercenary ends to serve, are unable to oppose corrup|tion, especially if at any time the public treasure shall be unfaithfully squandered away to corrupt their boroughs.
<Q>Country gentlemen, indeed, may make some weak efforts; but as they generally prove un|successful, and the time of a fresh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">truggle is at so great a <HI>distance,</HI> they at last grow faint in the dispute, give up their country for lost, and retire in <HI>despair.</HI> Despair naturally produces <HI>indolence,</HI> and that is the <HI>proper</HI> disposition for <HI>slavery.</HI> Ministers of state un|derstand this very well, and are therefore unwilling to awaken the nation out of its lethargy by frequent elections. They know that the spirit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> liberty, like every other virtue of the mind, is to be kept alive only by constant action; that it is impossible to en|slave the nation, while it is perpetually upon its guard. Let country gentlemen then, by having frequent op|portunities of exerting themselves, be k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pt warm and active in their contention for the public good. This will raise that zeal and indignation which will at last get the better of these undue influences, by which the officers of the crown, though unknown to the several boroughs, have been able to supplant country g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntle|men

<P><Q>Long parliaments</Q>

<Q>have in former reigns proved the unhappy cause of great calamities to this nation, and have been at all times declared an innovation upon our consti|tution.

<P>It has been observed by some defenders of long par|liaments, that even the long pensioned parliament under <HI>Ch.</HI> II. became more faithful to the interest of
<PB N="156" REF="013851_0186_0F9E2B68A83240B0">
the people, and more intractable to the court, at last, than at first. Sir <HI>I. Barnard</HI> gives a very satisfactory answer to this in the same debate <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. VIII.181.</NOTE>.
<Q>As to the long parliament in king <HI>Charles</HI>'s time, though they did not toward the end shew the same servile com|pliance that they had done many years before, yet it is plain that the crown thought that parliament <HI>fitter</HI> for the purposes of the court, at that time, than they could expect any new parliament chosen by the people to be; otherwise, as the king had it in his power, he would have certainly <HI>dissolved</HI> them much sooner: and if that long parliament really deserved the name usually given to it, we must con|clude that their non-compliance at last was not owing to their virtue, or a want of inclination to receive, but to a want of <HI>power</HI> in the crown to give. The people were not then accustomed to bear such heavy burdens as they do at present, the reve|nues of the crown were not so large, nor the posts and places, at the disposal of the crown, so nume|rous; there was not such a formidable standing army, to support the parliament, in case they had gone on in the same servile method. And as the complaints of the people grew loud and clamorous, as there was little to be got and a great deal to be apprehended, by the continuance of a servile compliance with the courts measures, it is very probable that these were the true reasons of that parliament's becoming at last so restive. If the nation was now in the same state it was at that time, I should not be half so much afraid of septennial parliaments as I think I have now good reason to be.</Q></P>
<P>Sir <HI>I. Barnard</HI> gives a very good answer to the trite and disingenous objection against short parliaments,
<PB N="157" REF="013851_0187_0F9E2B6961DA8CB8">
which our courtiers are always playing off upon us. <Q>The animosities, disputes, and divisions about elec|tions, says he, have been set in the most dreadful light, and have been represented as so great an incon|venience, that we ought to run the risk of having our <HI>constitution overturned</HI> rather than submit to it. But, Sir, can it be imagined that there would be the same contention for a seat in parliament which was to continue but for one year, or even for three, that there is for one which is to continue for seven? The example of the city of <HI>London</HI> plainly shews us the contrary. As the common council-men and a great many other officers in the city are chosen <HI>annually,</HI> I have had occasion to be often present at the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e annual elections, and never could find, that they were attended with any great heats and animo|sit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, or with any inconvenience; for after the elec|tion is over, the contending parties go home and live in the same friendship they did before. And I am convinced the case would be the very same, if annual elections for members of this house were restored. The same man might perhaps be conti|tinued and rechosen every year for many years toge|ther, probably without any dispute or opposition; but his bein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> liable every year to be turned out, would be a continual check upon his behaviour, and would make him study the interests of the peo|ple, instead of pursuing only some private and selfish views of his own. Even as elections stand at present, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e would be no such contentions, nor any such heats and animosities as we hear of if they were entirely le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t to gentlemen who have a natural interest in the place: in such case, if a candidate found him|self defeated by fair means only, and merely by the superior interest of his antagonist, it would not raise
<PB N="158" REF="013851_0188_0F9E2B6A1CDBE8B0">
his indignation; it would occasion no heats or ani|mosities; he would wait with patience for a new opportunity, and in the mean time would endeavour to recommend himself to his country by acts of hos|pitality and benevolence. It is ministers of state intermeddling in elections; it is election-brokers and such dealers in corruption, that occasion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the heats and animosities we have: for when a gentleman of a great natural interest in a place sees his electors obliged by power, or bribed by money, to vote against him, perhaps in favour of an utter stranger; it cannot but raise his indignation; it may indeed be expected to raise his utmost fury and revenge. It is certain, Sir, that if the peo|ple were entirely left to themselves, they would without much contention always chuse those gentle|men, who, by having large properties of their own, might be reasonably supposed to be such as would take the best care of the properties of their fellow subjects: but if the people should ever begin to see their representatives making their seats in parliament places of profit, and bartering their votes and their behaviour in parliament for posts, places, and pen|sions; the people will soon follow the example of their representatives, and will insist upon sharing with them in the profits. Thus, by degrees, the minds of the people will be debauched; they will be brought to think, that the selling their votes at elections is no crime; the representatives, who buy their seats, must sell their votes; and at last all regard for the public good will be generally laid aside by all sorts of men.

even for the <HI>treasury</HI> itself, if ever the public money should come to be so misapplied, to issue yearly sums of money sufficient to get the better of the natural interest, which country-gentlemen always have in the places where they and their families have perhaps for many generations resided. The con|sequence of which wil be, that none but country gentlemen, and those who have a natural interest in the place, will ever appear as candidates.

<P><Q>When we reflect on the danger of entrusting power too long in the same hands; when we con|sider how often in former times the liberty of this country has been sacrificed and sold by long conti|nued parliaments; and that a frequent recourse to their constituents, the people, is a certain and ne|cessary check to bad measures and worse intentions; we require you to prosecute in the most vigorous manner a repeal of the septennial act, and to restore the salutary form of triennial parliaments, as the principal means of securing the rights, and support|ing the dignity of a free nation <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<P>In the debate on the motion for annual parliaments, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1744 Mr. <HI>Thomas Carew</HI> argued as follows;</P>
<P><Q>Sir, the members of this house are the great and general inquest of the nation. We are to take notice of, and to take proper methods for redressing all the grievances that occur, whether they be such as relate to the kingdom in general, or such as relate to the particular counties, cities, or boroughs we represent. Now as grievances are almost an|nually occurring, and as some grievances are the more difficult to be removed, the longer they con|tinue; therefore it is necessary we should visit our constituents at least <HI>once</HI> a year, to know their senti|ments, and to examine, upon the spot, the grie|vances they complain of. But this is not to be expected, unless you make the elections annual; for
<PB N="161" REF="013851_0191_0F9E2B6C83CFE038">
we find by experience that after gentlemen are once chosen for a long term of years, they fix their abode in this city, and seldom revisit their constituents, till it becomes necessary for them to go down to sollicit their votes at a new election. Nay, since the establishment of septennial parliaments, we have often had gentlemen in this house&punc; who never <HI>saw</HI> the borough that sent them hither, nor knew any thing of its constitution or interest; perhaps could not recollect its name, till they looked into the printed lists of parliament for their own name, and there found they represented such a borough. An|other part of our business, Sir, is to represent to our sovereign the sentiments of our constituents with regard to the measures he is advised by his ministers to pursue, as well as the persons he employs in the executive part of government. If we ever think of doing this faithfully and sincerely, we must visit our constituents at least <HI>once</HI> a year, because every year produces some new measure, and every year some new persons are introduced into public business. This I say is another part of our duty, and when it is faithfully and sincerely performed, it is of great advantage to the prince upon the throne, because it prevents his being led on in a track of unpopular measures, till both he and his ministers are over|whelmed in the torrent of popular resentment, which often happens in arbitrary countries, where the prince is tumbled headlong from his throne, before he knows any thing of his having pursued unpopu|lar or wrong measures; whereas, had he had timely information, he might have restored himself to the love and affection of his subjects, by making a just sacrifice of his wicked counsellors to the resentment of his oppressed people. As the <HI>prince</HI> can have no

interest, seperate from his people; his interest, if he rightly considers, must lead him to gain the love and esteem of his people, and to avoid every thing that may give them discontent, It is therefore <HI>his</HI> interest to have always a house of commons, that knows, and will faithfully and speedily represent to him the complaints and grievances of his people. But this is directly opposite to the interest of his <HI>ministers.</HI> In all countries, and in this as much as any other, ministers have an interest separate from that of the people. They are for enriching them|selves, their families, tools and sycophants, at the expence of the people; and it is their business to keep all the avenues to the throne shut up against the complaints of the people, lest the prince should, as every wise one will, sacrifice them to his own security. Ministers must therefore be for having always a house of commons, that either does not know, or will not faithfully represent to their sove|reign, the complaints and grievances of the people; and as we are much more affected with what we see than with what we hear of, it is the business of a minister to prevent the members of this house, if possible, from ever seeing their constituents; because the less we are affected with, the more easily we may be prevailed on to conceal from our sovereign, or even to misrepresent to him the complaints of the people. Thus, Sir, it is apparently the interest of the <HI>king,</HI> it is apparently the interest of the <HI>country,</HI> to have <HI>short</HI> parliaments and frequent general elec|tions; but it is apparently the interest of <HI>ministers,</HI> especially <HI>wicked</HI> ministers, to have parliaments as long and general elections as seldom as possible ^a.</Q></P>

says a member of the commons on that occasion)
<Q>that bribery and corrup|tion in elections must always be the necessary con|sequences of long parliaments, and that if bribery and corruption in elections be not put an end to, they will put an end to our constitution, and esta|blish in this nation the very worst sort of government that was ever in any country established. For gentlemen will soon find out, if they have not found it out already, that it can signify nothing to stand candidates for members of parliament in opposition to the <HI>ministers</HI> for the time being; because, tho' a <HI>few</HI> of them by their popularity, their hospitality, and their great expence at the time of the elections, may get themselves chosen, yet the <HI>ministers,</HI> by bribery and corruption, will always procure a ma|jority of their friends to be elected, or at least returned, for the next ensuing parliament, so that no man, who sets up upon a truly patriotic scheme, can thereby propose to do his country any real service. And when this comes to be the general opinion, no man, who is governed singly by a sincere love for his country, will ever think of standing a candidate at any election. On the contrary, such men will always avoid being chosen, that they may not expose themselves to the resentment of the court, without
<PB N="166" REF="013851_0196_0F9E2B71D6091D00">
being thereby able to serve their country. Contested elections may sometimes happen; but it will never be about who shall <HI>serve,</HI> but about who shall <HI>sell,</HI> their country. Consequently it is evident, that bribery and corruption at <HI>elections</HI> must at last bring on bribery and corruption in the <HI>house.</HI> Can we expect that a corrupt parliament will ever refuse to grant the <HI>crown</HI> what number of standing <HI>forces,</HI> or what public <HI>revenue,</HI> the ministers for the time being may please to insist on? Thus we shall at last be brought under that very form of government which was established at <HI>Rome</HI> under their first emperors, that is to say, an absolute monarchy supported by a cor|rupt parliament and a mercenary army; and the history of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, from its first establish|ment to its utter extinction, must convince us, that it is the very worst form of government that ever was invented; for from thence we may learn that such monarchs as the <HI>Roman</HI> emperors may sacrifice the public interest to their private passions more openly, and may commit more whimsical cru|elties under the form of law, than any arbitrary monarch dare venture upon; and that such a par|liament will always be more factious under a good prince than under a wicked and tyrannical one; because the former will disdain to sacrifice the pub|lic service solely to parliamentary merit, or to squan|der the public money in bribing the electors or the members, both which the latter will always do with|out measure or reserve. Such a form of government must necessarily be the most oppressive upon the poor, the most inconsistent with trade and com|merce, and of the most pernicious consequence to the religion, morals, and courage of the people.
<PB N="167" REF="013851_0197_0F9E2B7262253218">
I say first, that such a form of government must be the most oppressive upon the <HI>poor,</HI> because taxes must be imposed for the support of the government and as the rich must have always a great influence in parliament, they will in the methods of taxa|tion take as much care as they can of themselves. Therefore they will chuse to supply the public reve|nue by taxes upon the <HI>necessaries</HI> and conveniences of life, because to every such tax a poor man, who lives comfortably by his labour, pays as much as the richest man in the kingdom. And such taxes the ministers of the crown will always be most fond of, because of the multitude of <HI>officers</HI> that must be employed in the collection. In the next place I say that such a form of government must be the most inconsistent with <HI>trade</HI> and commerce, which must be evident from what I have just mentioned; for taxes upon the necessaries and conveniences of life must raise the price of labour. This must raise the price of every sort of manufacture; and this must diminish, if not totally prevent, their sale at any <HI>foreign</HI> market. And, lastly, I say that such a form of government must be of the most pernicious con|sequence to the religion, morals, and courage of the people. For as to the religion and <HI>morals</HI> of the people, it is evident the more profligate the people generally are as to every principle of religion, mo|rality, or politics; bribery and corruption will, both in parliament and at elections, have the greater and the more certain effect. In such a form of government therefore the governing powers will take every method they can contrive for subduing and rooting out of the human mind every passion, every affection, but the desire of sensual pleasure and its
<PB N="168" REF="013851_0198_0F9E2AA71433A180">
constant attendant, a boundless love of money. In all assemblies the members will harangue and vote not for the sake of gaining esteem or of serving their country; but for the sake of raising their price; in the church the clergy will study and preach, not for the sake of religion, but of getting better bene|fices. At the bar, the lawyers will plead not for the sake of justice, but of increasing the number or the value of their fees; and in the wars, either by land or sea, the soldiers will fight not for the sake of glory or the honour of their country, but of plunder or prizes. Thus the love of <HI>money</HI> will become the sole <HI>governing</HI> principle among the peo|ple; and whilst the government can, by taxes or otherwise, get money enough to answer this popular passion of its own creating, it will continue abso|lute and undisturbed; but the moment it ceases to be able to do so, faction will ensue in their assem|blies, and mutiny in their fleets and armies. Then as to the <HI>courage</HI> of the people, in such a form of government, it is certain that the governing powers will take every possible method to render the people in general cowardly, undisciplined and unarmed; because the more they are so, the more easily they may be overawed by a mercenary stand|ing <HI>army,</HI> the more impossible it will be for any great and antient family to defend themselves by an insurrection of the people in their favour against the most unjust and cruel oppression. Even as to those of the standing army, courage, as well as every other sort of virtuous merit, will be ne|glected, or at least not duly rewarded; because all public <HI>rewards</HI> will, and indeed must, be applied by the governing powers towards gaining and secur|ing

<P><HI>April</HI> 26, 1771, Mr. <HI>Sawbridge</HI> made a motion for leave to bring in a bill to shorten the duration of par|liaments. He shewed, that this branch of the con|stitution had been established by our <HI>Saxon</HI> ancestors, at which time they had only been <HI>annual</HI>; that they were set aside 140 years by the <HI>Normans</HI>; that on their revival they had continued of short duration (mostly annual) till the reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. whose tyranny was never complete till established by that long par|liament; that the next long parliament was that commonly so called of 1641. The pensionary par|liament in the reign of <HI>Cha.</HI> II. was productive of the worst consequences to the constitution; to remedy which the triennial bill was passed, forbidding parli|ament to sit more than three years. This was over|turned by that <HI>breach</HI> into the <HI>constitution</HI> in the reign of <HI>Geo.</HI> I. the passing of the <HI>septennial</HI> bill. Though perhaps the particular necessities of the times might render such an act at that day useful, (a rebellion just crushed, and a pretender to the throne, making it improper to call the people together at that time) yet that necessity was <HI>now</HI> at an end, none of those dan|gers now hanging over us. That the length of par|liaments gave up that <HI>power</HI> which the <HI>constituents</HI> ought to have over their <HI>representatives,</HI> viz of fre|quent examination into their conduct, and rejection of them if they thought them unworthy.

shortening the duration of parliaments he should in|cline to <HI>annual,</HI> as subject to fewer objections, in his opinion, than triennial, but that must be the subject of future debates.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of Exclusion by Rotation.</HEAD>
<P>THE shortening of parliaments <HI>alone,</HI> without <HI>exclusion</HI> by <HI>rotation,</HI> would prove only a pal|liation, not a <HI>radical</HI> cure. It would, if I may so suddenly change the metophor, be stopping some, but not <HI>all</HI> the leaks. Suppose parliaments re|duced to annual, might not a court candidate bribe his electors with a seventh part of what he now gives for his borough? And might not the minister bribe

the corrupt member's vote in the house with a seventh part of what he now gives? I do not ferget what is observed on this by Sir <HI>W. Wyndham,</HI> in his speech above quoted, p. 148. <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That a seventh part of a sum would make so poor a figure, that it would hardly prove a temptation. That though an elector might think it worth while to be damned for 20 or 21 guineas, he might grudge to hazard his soul for the scurvy price of three, as he might die before next election; and that a member, who might be expected to sell himself to the devil and the minister for a pen|sion of 700<HI>l.</HI> a year, would despise a single hundred.</Q>
Allowing all this its due weight, it is still true' that a member chosen annually for seven years toge|ther, has at the end of the seven years sat <HI>as long</HI> in the house as if he had been chosen for seven years at <HI>once</HI>; and how far rogues might have an understand|ing between themselves, so as to elude this salutary regulation, an honest man cannot guess. It is a com|mon electioneering trick in our times, for the can|didate to <HI>lend</HI> the electors small sums upon their notes of hand; those notes understood to be void if the elec|tor votes right. Might not the same game be played between the elector and the candidate, and between the member and the minister, if the period of parliament were reduced to annual? This could certainly not be, if it were certain, that the very next session two thirds of the members must be <HI>excluded</HI> by rotation; because whatever was by the corrupt set voted, might be un|voted the very next session, and then&mdash;<HI>Omnis labor ef|fusus</HI>; the money would be all thrown away; the pros|pect of which would effectually prevent the minister's hazarding it. Besides, it would be impossible to find a sufficient number of places. As the period of parlia|ment
<PB N="175" REF="013851_0205_0F9E2AB1E7CB7060">

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of electing by Ballot.</HEAD>
<P>THE electing of members by ballot would like|wise be a check on court influence in parlia|ment. There ought to be no voting <HI>viv&acirc; voce,</HI> where balloting would better prevent influ|ence, caballing, animosity, or resentment. Therefore all elections for members of parliament ought, as things are <HI>now,</HI> to be by ballot. Courts of directors, members of the commons in their house, and all those, who are liable to be called to <HI>account</HI> for their transactions (which peers, electors, jurymen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are not) ought to vote with an <HI>audible</HI> voice.</P>
<P>But let it be observed here, that making parliamen|tary representation <HI>adequate</HI> would supersede the neces|sity of balloting at elections. For court influence, and whatever could byass <HI>electors,</HI> would be then utterly cut up by the roots, when many thousands of votes were necessary to send in the members for any one county, comprehending its towns. To set about bribing 401 electors in order to gain one member, or 202, 104 electors to secure a <HI>majority</HI> in the house, a minister must be lord of the mines of <HI>Potosi.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Members of Parliament no longer hold themselves res|ponsible to the People.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the inadequate state of representation in parliament, and the enormous length of their period, have arisen several most fatal conse|quences. The first I shall mention is, That mem|bers, being generally elected by <HI>handfuls</HI> of persons, possessed of <HI>little property,</HI> and <HI>less knowledge</HI> of the in|terest of their country, and impowered as law-makers for <HI>seven years,</HI> have given up all thought of being <HI>accountable</HI> to any set of men upon earth for their proceedings in parliament. And it must be allowed, that on the present ludicrous foot on which repre|sentation stands, it would be <HI>disgracing</HI> a gentleman beyond sufferance, to call him to the bar of a set of poor unlettered <HI>Cornish</HI> burghers, and to expect him to an|swer the <HI>silly</HI> questions they would put to him concern|ing his conduct in the house, of which they cannot be supposed competent judges, any more than they are of the <HI>qualifications</HI> of a legislator, which shews the ab|surdity of their having the power of <HI>making</HI> legislators, not for themselves only, but for the nation in general. Were parliamentary representation upon its proper foot, no member would be sent into the house by a
<PB N="181" REF="013851_0211_0F9E2AB9D11E9950">
puny <HI>burgh</HI>; but all would be county-members, and every member would have, to his admission as a law-maker, the sanction of the majority of the inhabitants of a county, comprehending the cities and towns in it. From such a <HI>respectable</HI> body as this, it would be an honour to gentlemen to receive instructions; and to be responsible to them, would not be beneath the dignity of any person whatever.</P>
<P>It is notorious, that the right of constituents to in|struct their members, and the consequent duty of members to obey instructions, is in our times ques|tioned by many, and by many given up. Yet it is certain, first, that no <HI>harm</HI> could come from the mem|bers of parliament being obliged to wait for instruc|tions from their constituents, supposing the consti|tuents what they ought to be, because <HI>legislation</HI> is, the least of any thing, a matter of <HI>haste</HI>; and the exe|cutive is not in the parliament.</P>
<P>There seems to be a palpable inconsistency in the courtly doctrine, That the people are wholly <HI>unqua|lified</HI> for judging of political matters, and that there|fore their sense in petitions, remonstrances, and in|structions, is not to be regarded. If so, why is the choice of members of parliament left to the <HI>people?</HI> Why should not the <HI>ministry</HI> nominate them at once? If the people are incapable of judging of politics, they are incapable of judging of the qualifications of <HI>members.</HI> But to set this absurdity in its full light, it is to be observed, that the courtiers, at the same time they argue for the incapacity of the people in <HI>general,</HI> insist that the election of legislators is best trusted to the <HI>most incapable</HI> part of the people. Simi|lar to which ingenious reasoning is their plea, when they tell us, <Q>The people are in fault, why do they
<PB N="182" REF="013851_0212_0F9E2ABAC0B76D08">
let themselves be bribed by the court?</Q> So every town-rake cries out against the frailty of women (himself the cause of the failure of female virtue.) And because the people are <HI>liable</HI> to be corrupted, our courtiers insist, that the election of law-makers is best in the hands of that part of the people who are <HI>most liable</HI> to be corrupted. Into such absurdities do men plunge themselves, when they undertake the defence of what their understandings and consciences revolt against!</P>
<P>In the remarkable answer of lord <HI>Percival,</HI> member for <HI>Westminster,</HI> to instructions sent him by his con|stituents <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. XIV.30.</NOTE>, we have that gentleman's notion of the duty of representatives in respect of instructions. And he speaks the sense of too many.</P>
<P><Q>Gentlemen, you are welcome upon all occasions, and I look upon this application as a fresh instance of your friendship&mdash;As I never concealed my prin|ciples from you, so I will never depart from them. The only motives that direct my conduct are the pre|servation of the constitution of my country, the security of the present royal family upon the throne, and the common liberty of <HI>Europe.</HI>&mdash;These views I shall always think inseparable.&mdash;In the prosecu|tion of them, my judgment sometimes may, my heart shall never fail me.&mdash;I remember on my part, that to your independent voice, I owe my seat in parliament:&mdash;on yours, you will not forget that I ought to be independent there.</Q>
[True, my good lord, you ought to be independent on a <HI>court</HI>; but not on 10,000 people of property who sent you to parlia|ment on purpose to do <HI>their</HI> business.] When I differ from your sentiments, I shall do it with great reluc|tance,
<PB N="183" REF="013851_0213_0F9E2ABB616210F8">
and then only when I am convinced, that your <HI>true interest</HI> must extort it from me.' [Of which true interest your lordship, of your great <HI>modesty,</HI> holds yourself a better judge than the many thousands who employ you as their <HI>agent.</HI> How would your good lordship take such language from your steward?
<Q>In such a case the crime is equal to flatter popularity,</Q>
<Q>[to do your constituents busi|ness, as <HI>they</HI> chuse, is to <HI>flatter</HI> popularity,]</Q>
or to court power. It becomes me to respect both; but it is my duty to follow neither beyond those limits, which the circumstances of time, prudence, neces|sity, and the public safety can alone determine.<Q>So the <HI>French</HI> king, or the grand <HI>Turk,</HI> might be ex|pected to silence the petitions of their subjects, by telling them, that the prince is the only judge of the circumstances, of time, prudence, and necessity.</Q></P>
<P>Some argue, that members of parliament are not obliged to obey instructions of their constituents, be|cause the constituents do not <HI>hear</HI> the <HI>debates,</HI> and there|fore cannot be supposed <HI>judges</HI> of the matter to be voted. But the lords may send votes by proxy, tho' they do not <HI>hear</HI> the <HI>debates.</HI> The very truth is, that the members have no opportunity of being at all better judges of most matters to be voted i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> parliament than men of understanding and reading, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o never sat in the house. So that the hearing of the debates gives no such mighty advantage to the members above the con|stituents. Besides, there is nothing to hinder a mem|ber's informing his constituents of the reasons (occur|ring in the course of the debate) why he intends to vote so, or so. If they allow them, all is well. If he votes <HI>contrary</HI> to their direction, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h he <HI>means</HI> their real interest, he only shews himself a wrong-headed agent, who will act according to his own opi|nion
<PB N="184" REF="013851_0214_0F9E2ABC6F693CD0">
in spite of his masters; and ought, besides being immediately <HI>turned</HI> out of his office, to be <HI>answer|able</HI> for all damages.</P>
<P>The excellent <HI>Davenant,</HI> 'tis true, lays no great stress on responsibility in members of parliament. But this is only because in his times they had few examples of parliaments so corrupted as to come to have an interest different from that of their constituents. But in our degenerate times, when we know, that parliaments may be effectually drawn away from consulting the interest of their representatives, it is strange that judge <HI>Blackstone</HI> (who writes what I have quoted from him above, p. 179) should write as follows:</P>
<P>A member of parliament
<Q>is not bound, like a de|puty in the United Provinces, to consult with, or take the advice of his constituents upon any particu|lar point, unless he himself thinks it proper, or pru|dent so to do <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blackst.</HI> COM. I.159.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Suppose then a majority of the house of commmons, corrupted by a villainous court, should propose to lay an exorbitant tax upon the people. Suppose the majority of the constituents, and people of <HI>England,</HI> should instruct the majority of the members against this tax, could the act establishing this tax, passed in direct <HI>opposition</HI> to the mind of the <HI>people of Eng|land,</HI> (which judge <HI>Blackstone</HI>'s doctrine allows) be said to be, in any sense, <HI>constitutional,</HI> or par|liamentary, or in any degree more tolerable to a free people, than if the <HI>king</HI> in <HI>council</HI> had pretended to impose the tax? If the votes of the electors be the whole and sole foundation of the authority, the members have to sit, and to make laws, can it be con|ceived, that the electors gave this authority on purpose to plunder themselves?</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="013851_0215_0F9E2AC0AACFCEF0">If the members of the house of commons are not obliged to regard the instructions of their constitu|ents; the people of this country chuse a set of des|pots every seven years, and are as perfect slaves as the <HI>Turks,</HI> excepting the few months of a general election. And it is the trumping up of this doctrine, that gave <HI>Voltaire</HI> the hint to write, that the <HI>English</HI> are only free once in seven years, and then they have not the sense to make the proper use of their freedom. <HI>Pudet haec approbria, &amp;c.</HI> That a <HI>Frenchman</HI> should have it in his power to turn <HI>English</HI> liberty thus to ridi|cule, is mortifying enough; but that an <HI>English</HI> judge should support his contempt of our liberty, is still more humiliating.</P>
<P>But how could the spirit of liberty be expected to breathe in the works of a gentleman, who speaking of the just vengeance, which a frantic tyrant, the destroyer of liberty, and butcher of his subjects, brought upon himself, uses such expression as&mdash;
<Q>the <HI>infamous</HI> and <HI>unparalleled</HI> trial of king <HI>Charles</HI> I. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">COM. I.191.</NOTE></Q>
And again<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 210.</NOTE>, the fatal catastrophe of that pious and unfortunate prince;' and who apologizes for his rapacious pro|ceedings, by telling us, he gave up the right to ton|nage and poundage (after keeping it for fifteen years, in spite of the continual remonstrances of parliament) when he found he could keep it no longer; which the judge calls

Let the reader peruse the incomparable Mrs. <HI>Macaulay</HI>'s history of his horrid reign, or indeed any, even that of his professed apologist <HI>Clarendon,</HI> and determine whether exempting him from the guilt of tyranny, it is possible to fix it on any prince that ever disgraced

a throne, or filled a kingdom with confusion and bloodshed. As a friend to human nature, I cannot help declaring my opinion, that had he been guilty of no crime besides his offering the <HI>Scotch</HI> army a bribe of four counties, and the plunder of <HI>London,</HI> to invade <HI>Eng|land</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Ludlow</HI>'s MEM.</NOTE>, or had he been guilty of no instance of tyranny besides his fighting and slaughtering his subjects about his over-strained prerogative&mdash;had he had as many heads as the <HI>Lernean hydra,</HI> he ought to have lost them all. Nor can I, in reading judge <HI>Blackstone</HI>'s Com|mentaries, help lamenting, that a writer, whose ad|mirable work will be read as long as <HI>England,</HI> its laws, and language remain, should be so sparingly tinctured with the true and generous principles of liberty, on the support and prevalency of which, the glory of the <HI>British</HI> empire depends.</P>

<P>THE doctrine so much preached of late, by our speech-makers and courtly writers, that mem|bers of parliament are not obliged to regard the instructions of their constituents, is a mere inno|vation.

<P>That stern old patriot, in his XLIVth sect. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DISC. GOV. 450.</NOTE> over|throws the doctrine of absolute power delegated to the members of the house of commons by their constitu|ents. He considers members of parliament as the <HI>servants</HI> of the public.

<P>The qualifications of a member of parliament, according to the author of an excellent tract pub|lished in the beginning of this century, intituled, REASONS FOR ANNUAL PARLIAMENTS, are sense, courage, and integrity. By sense, he means chiefly knowledge of the interests of <HI>England</HI> (though classi|cal learning and fluency in haranguing are in our times essentially necessary) commerce, manufactures, liberty, securities and violations of the people, and redress; resources for war and peace, and connections with other states, balance of power, &amp;c. Courage against the encroachments of a court, against solici|tations, places, preferments, threats, cabals, &amp;c. Integrity not merely to the whigs, or to the minority, but to the nation. No man ought to be <HI>chosen,</HI> that will not receive <HI>instruction.</HI> There are no counties and few towns that do not understand the interest of their country enough to give general instructions.
<Q>You have a <HI>right</HI> to instruct your members. It was the custom formerly to instruct all the members, and the nature of deputation shews that the cus|tom was well grounded <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">REASONS FOR ANNUAL PARL.</NOTE>.</Q>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Arguments for Responsibility of Members to the People.</HEAD>
<P>IN the debate upon the motion for repealing the septennial act, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1734, Sir <HI>W. Wyndham</HI> opposed Sir <HI>W. Young,</HI> who had endeavoured to depriciate the necessity of responsibility.</P>
<P><Q>The gentleman [meaning Sir <HI>William</HI>] said, that we were to have <HI>no dependence</HI> upon our <HI>constituents</HI>; he went further; he said it was a dangerous depen|dance; nay, he went further still, and said it was <HI>more</HI> dangerous than a dependance on the <HI>crown.</HI> This my worthy friend took notice of, and, with his usual modesty, called it a new doctrine. It is, Sir, not only a new doctrine, but is the most mon|strous, the most slavish doctrine was ever heard; and such a doctrine as I hope no man will ever dare to support within these walls. I am persuaded, Sir, the learned gentleman did not mean what the words he happened to make use of may seem to import; for though the people of a county, city, or borough, may be misled, and may be induced to give instruc|tions which are contrary to the true interest of their country, yet I hope he will allow, that in times past the <HI>crown</HI> has been <HI>oftener</HI> misled; and conse|quently we must conclude that it is more apt to be misled in time to come than we can suppose the <HI>peo|ple</HI> to be <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. VIII.189.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Though it should be affirmed, that a member of par|liament is not responsible to his <HI>own</HI> constituents, yet it would be strange to assert, that <HI>all</HI> the members may neglect the remonstrance of <HI>all</HI> the constituents in
<PB N="200" REF="013851_0230_0F9E2AD0D366EB40">
<HI>England</HI> to the same purpose. In that case, the mem|bers could not be said to be representatives of the peo|ple of <HI>England,</HI> but must be considered as a set of ab|solute despots, acting for their own private interest. But this is inconsistent with the very idea of <HI>election,</HI> or of <HI>delegated</HI> power. And if <HI>one</HI> member is not re|sponsible, neither is <HI>another.</HI> If <HI>one</HI> is responsible, <HI>all</HI> are. If revolution-principles are justifiable, that is, if the <HI>people</HI> may take the <HI>power</HI> out of the hands of a <HI>king,</HI> or government, when they abuse it, it follows, that the king and government are in all cases <HI>responsi|ble</HI> to the <HI>people,</HI> and that a majority of the people can at any time change the government. This is not de|nying the <HI>danger</HI> and <HI>trouble</HI> of revolutions, nor the difficulty of determining what is the sense of the ma|jority of the people. But if members of parliament are not obliged to regard instructions from their con|stituents, what is to become of a poor town, or coun|try-place, unable to bear a tax no way grievous to other wealthier places? The house receives no <HI>pe|titions</HI> upon <HI>money-bills</HI>; because every place either sends a member or members of its own, or is repre|sented by the county-members. But, if the house is neither to be informed by <HI>petition</HI> nor by <HI>instruction,</HI> how is it to be informed? This leaves an open door for the most cruel oppression.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Coke</HI> says,
<Q>It is the custom of parliament when any new device is moved for in parliament on the king's behalf for his aid, or the like,</Q>
[as a little demand of half a million to pay civil-list debts <Q>that the commons may answer, They <HI>dare</HI> not agree to it without conference with their <HI>countries.</HI></Q> He gives an instance of this 9 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. which is applied by Mr. <HI>Pulteney</HI> in the debate on the excise-scheme, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1733. And Mr. <HI>Pulteney</HI> adds, that the ab|horrence shewn by the people against that scheme, was a sufficient reason for rejecting it.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="013851_0231_0F9E2AD13A2FC080">So far from questioning the responsibility of mem|bers, I should think it reasonable and proper to demand an <HI>oath</HI> of the members at their taking their seats, be|sides the usual oaths; I mean an oath of fidelity to their constituents, by which they should declare before God and men, that they come into the house by the free and uninfluenced choice of a true majority of those, who by law have the right of choice; and that they will, in all their speeches and votes, faithfully and zealously pursue their country's good, in spite of all temptation to the contrary. The most incorrupt parliament ought not to refuse giving their constituents all the security in their power. An honest man does not refuse to give his bond. The most virtuous are the most de|sirous of avoiding suspicion, and the most anxious a|bout standing in a clear light before the world.</P>

<Q>a nation, which having had unaccountable magistrates, has not felt them to be crying and consuming mischiefs.

<P><Q>When we elect persons to <HI>represent</HI> us in parlia|ment (says a judicious writer <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">LOND MAG. <HI>Ian.</HI> 1760, p. 33.</NOTE>) we must not be sup|posed to depart from the smallest right which we have <HI>deposited</HI> with them.

The men, whom we thus depute to parliament, are not the bare likeness or reflexion of us their constituents; they actually contain our <HI>powers</HI> and <HI>privileges,</HI> and are, as it were, the very persons of the people they represent. We are the parliament in them; we speak and act by them.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Unwarrantable Privileges assumed by the House of Commons, in consequence of inadequate Representa|tion, and too long Parliaments.</HEAD>
<P>IN consequence of the inadequate state of parlia|mentary representation, the house of commons has assumed such a superiority over its constitu|ents (and indeed, the burgesses of the meaner boroughs, who, as has been seen, have the credit of electing the
<PB N="206" REF="013851_0236_0F9E2AD5904CE9A0">
majority of the house, are a set of very contemptible people, scarce capable of electing, or of instructing) that, despising the thought of being answerable to them, they arrogate certain privileges <HI>never granted</HI> by the <HI>people,</HI> and assume the power of protecting, excluding, expelling their own members, of deciding their own causes, prosecuting, arresting, imprisoning, reprimanding, and fining their employers at their ar|bitrary pleasure, and according to I know not what <HI>lex et consuetuo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> parliamenti,</HI> which tramples on <HI>Mag|na Charta,</HI> and the Bill of Rights.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Iones</HI> indeed argues strongly, that the law of parliament is the law of the land. But in the prosecution of <HI>Clarendon</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. I.104.</NOTE> it being uncertain at first, which way they should proceed, precedents were searched, and Sir <HI>Thomas Littleton</HI> reported, that the committee had found
<Q><HI>various</HI> proceedings in different parliaments.</Q>
What is then the <HI>consuetudo parlia|menti?</HI></P>
<P>Privilege and pre-emminence of every kind is invi|dious, and odious to the people. Whoever wanted to excite the <HI>Roman</HI> people against the senate, never failed to mention the law forbidding marriage between the patricians and plebeians. Even where privilege is bestowed in consequence of <HI>merit,</HI> it is but aukwardly brooked.
<Q>Why must <HI>Aristides</HI> be honoured with the title of The Just, more than others?</Q>
said the <HI>Athenian,</HI> and voted his banishment on that ac|count <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plut.</HI> in ARIST. <HI>Corn. Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE>.</P>
<P>All privilege is a nuisance, whose extent is <HI>unknown</HI>; because the subject is thereby in danger of falling into <HI>undesigned</HI> offence. But it has always been made a point to
<PB N="207" REF="013851_0237_0F9E2AD9CFFD9CD8">
keep the extent of parliamentary privilege, preroga|tive royal, ministerial power, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> profound secrets. These are the <HI>arcana imperii,</HI> in <HI>English,</HI> tricks of state. But does the concealment of what may be <HI>dangerus</HI> to the people, shew, in government, a <HI>paternal</HI> ten|derness for the people? And is that government any thing better than a tyranny, which shews a want of paternal tenderness for the people? The truth is, our ministers chuse to secure a <HI>small</HI> convenience to them|selves (the convenience of keeping the people in fear of them) tho' at the risque of <HI>great</HI> loss to the subjects.</P>
<P>I would wish (says <HI>Iames</HI> I. in his speech, <HI>March,</HI> 1609 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">HARL MISCEL. I.12.</NOTE>) that the law were written in our vulgar tongue.&mdash;Every subject ought to understand the law, [and, among other laws, the parliament law]
<Q>under which he lives&mdash;that the excuse of ignorance may be taken away from those, who do not conform them|selves to them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In contending for the privilege of parliament, says a writer on general warrants <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. VI.288.</NOTE>, I desire to be under|stood to mean, not that insolent abuse of privilege, which has made its name odious, and its existence intolerable; by which members of parliament have usurped a power of making <HI>themselves</HI> judges in their <HI>own</HI> cause, and avengers of their own quarrels; by which the course of law and <HI>justice</HI> has been <HI>obstruct|ed,</HI> just <HI>debts with-held</HI> from many an unhappy cre|ditor, and property detained from its true inheritor. I beg leave to mark out a distinction between the <HI>privilege</HI> and the <HI>prerogative</HI> of parliament, defining the one to be the exercise of a tyrannous and <HI>oppressive</HI> jurisdiction over the rest of the subjects; the other to
<PB N="208" REF="013851_0238_0F9E2ADB600B56B0">
consist in that <HI>protection</HI> which secures the representa|tives of the people from the power of the <HI>crown.</HI> On keeping this privilege sacred and inviolate depends the freedom of parliament, and of consequence the being of our constitution.</Q></P>
<P>The only use of parliamentary privilege from arrest, is to prevent a <HI>tyrant,</HI> or a corrupt <HI>court,</HI> from im|prisoning, on pretence of debt, or distressing, such members as opposed their measures. But this might have been sufficiently provided against, without car|rying privilege to such an unreasonable length, that there should be <HI>no time</HI> of the year, when a member, and his dependents, should be obliged to pay their debts.</P>
<P>It is well observed by an eminent lawyer in his speech in parliament <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">LON<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, MAG, <HI>Iune,</HI> 1771, p. 288.</NOTE>, That the privileges of the members of the house of commons might be said to be those of the people, if the members of the house of commons had no <HI>interest</HI> different from that of the people, which he affirms, is the very contrary of the truth.</P>
<P>Mark, how sublime the style of the following.</P>
<P><Q>Resolved (by the commons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1699) That to assert, that the house of commons have no power of commitment, but of their own members, tends to the subversion of the constitution of the house of com|mons.</Q></P>
<P>We will allow the house of commons to have much <HI>higher</HI> powers. But let them be powers <HI>fit</HI> for a house of commons to have. Every puny justice has power of commitment. Again,</P>
<P><Q>Resolved, That to print or publish any books, or libels, reflecting upon the proceedings of the house
<PB N="209" REF="013851_0239_0F9E2ADD595181A0">
of commons, or of any member thereof, for, or relating to his service therein, is a high violation of the rights and privileges of the house of com|mons.</Q></P>
<P>This resolution puts an end to all <HI>enquiry</HI> into the behaviour of our <HI>trustees,</HI> and makes it impossible for us to call them to <HI>account,</HI> or to know, whether it will be safe to <HI>re-elect</HI> them or not. There is somewhat particularly gross and mean-spirited in stopping en|quiry. It always suggests the idea of somewhat, which will not bear enquiring into.
<Q>I care not, says the honest old philosopher, if there were a window in my breast, that any body might look in and see what is passing in my thoughts.</Q>
Felony, breach of the peace, and treason, deprive a member of his privilege <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blackst.</HI> COM. I.166.</NOTE>. And the commons lately gave up privilege in case of seditious libels. Thus we see them <HI>magnifying</HI> privi|lege against the <HI>people,</HI> and <HI>lowering</HI> it in servile com|plaisance to the <HI>court</HI>; directly contrary to what the spirit of liberty would dictate.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles Sedley</HI> observes, in his speech, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1699 that when complaint was made, that great part of the revenue remained unaccounted for, in the hands of the receivers, a member answered, It could not be helped; for that those receivers were <HI>members,</HI> and stood upon their <HI>privilege</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. III.195.</NOTE>. Nor is it to be wondered that they should; since every 100,000 <HI>l.</HI> of the pub|lick money kept back, yields 4000 <HI>l.</HI> a year interest; and a great officer of the state, whose department lies among the finances, may keep in his own hands many such sums for many years. But this is <HI>pocketing</HI> what
<PB N="210" REF="013851_0240_0F9E2ADDF673A6C8">
belongs to the <HI>public,</HI> and is as honest as it would be to steal sixpence a-piece out of 100,000 <HI>pockets.</HI></P>
<P>There seems to be a small inconsistency between the <HI>qualification</HI> act and the <HI>privilege</HI> of members against arrest for debt. The former says, No man shall be member for a county, if he has not 600 <HI>l.</HI> a year clear, nor for a city or borough, unless he has 300 <HI>l.</HI> But the privilege supposes, that a member may be <HI>unable</HI> to pay his debts; and, in that case, provides against his being arrested, to the great inconvenience and loss of those, who have trusted members. Now, if it be <HI>improper</HI> that a <HI>needy</HI> man be a <HI>member</HI> of the house of commons, why must this needy man be <HI>pri|vileged</HI> against arrests? Why should not the bailiffs have him, and another be elected in his room? If it be said, the arrest may be litigious; it may be the contrivance of a villainous minister, to put a friend to liberty out of the way on a critical occasion; the answer is short. Let the house of commons bail the arrested member, if they understand this to be the case; if not, let him be given up to his creditors. This would equally secure the member against ministe|rial tricks, and the creditor against abuse of privilege. It is criminal in any man to contract debts, which it is improbable he should ever be able to pay. It is cri|minal to protect such a debtor. Which doctrine, by the way, condemns all our too daring merchants, bankers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who take whatever credit they can have in consequence of the too easy credulity of mankind, and extend their adventures, by which only them|selves can be gainers, at the peril of hundreds, who may be undone by them. But a member of parlia|ment, a legislator, ought not to be supposed capable of ever coming into such circumstances, as to be liable to arrest for a just debt; or if he does, he ought to be
<PB N="211" REF="013851_0241_0F9E2ADEE7C17998">
left to the same law with other bankrupts. Where then is the honest use of this parliamentary screen? For it is to be observed, that privilege screens a mem|ber 40 days before and 40 days after the sitting of the house, against arrest for the most <HI>just</HI> debt, and for all sorts of offences, that do not come up to felony, breach of the peace, treason, or seditious libels.</P>
<P><HI>A. D.</HI> 1541, the commons begun privileging from arrest for debt by writ from the speaker. In former times, it was done by writ from the chancellor <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hume</HI>'s HIST. TUD. II.249.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is plain, that all the privileges assumed by mem|bers of parliament are not necessary for the <HI>pubilc ser|vice,</HI> whatever they may be for <HI>their pride</HI>; for they have often been dispensed with. An act was made, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1641, for laying down the privileges of parlia|ment for a session, because the citizens complained that they lost money by them <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. X&punc;50.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The freemen and citizens of <HI>London,</HI> in their peti|tition to parliament, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1646, complain of many members, who stand upon privilege, and refuse to pay their debts <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. XV.233.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>An order was made, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1647, that no persons under authority of parliament, but the members, shall have protection or immunity by reason of privilege, nor any member be free from action or prosecution, but obliged to <HI>answer.</HI> Only their <HI>persons</HI> not liable to arrest <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. XVI.486.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the year 1647, the commons ordered, that from <HI>Ianuary</HI> 20th of that year, none but members should, during that session, have protection by privilege of the house, in any suit; and that the estates of members be
<PB N="212" REF="013851_0242_0F9E2ADF4F66C790">
liable for debt, &amp;c. And the same year, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> gave up those lords, who by reason of their offences, had not liberty to sit in parliament, to be prosecuted by suits of law, and likewise their attendents, as if there were no parliament <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitelock</HI>'s MEM. 287, 290.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Privilege of members, as to person and estate, was taken off, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1649 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. XIX.98.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The lord mayor, aldermen, and commons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1646, complained to parliament, that many were sufferers by protection of privilege; they complained of jealousies fomented between parliament and city, and their mayor suspended; desire that the debts due by parliament to the city may be put in course of pay|ment <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid XIV.421.</NOTE>. The Lords answer with great acknowledge|ments of the important services of the city, which they promise never to forget; and to do every thing in their power for redressing the complaints of the citizens, and particularly of the lord mayor, of whom they speak very highly. Commons give it a very cold reception. <HI>Ludlow,</HI> in his MEMOIRS, calls the petition an insolent address, and the commons' answer, a declaration that they would preserve their authority and not be dictated to.</P>
<P>A standing order of the house was published, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1739, against members giving protections <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. XI.321.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>A good act was made, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1701, for explaining parliamentary privilege, which was a great nuisance,

<P><HI>A D.</HI> 1707, <HI>Asgill,</HI> a member, was in debt. His cre|ditors petitioned the house, that he may not be defend|ed by privilege from paying a just debt. It happened that <HI>Asgill</HI> had written a silly pamphlet about the pos|sibility of going to heaven without dying.

Why should not all privileges both of lords and commons, be put on this footing, that no member of either house be liable to arrest, but with consent of the house, and the house always to consent, unless when the cause is litigious or unjust?</P>
<P>When it was moved, that letters of members go fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e during the sitting of the house, Sir <HI>Heneage Finch</HI> said it was a beggarly proposal.

Some proposed to send, and break open the prison, and bring away Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> by force. [A whimsical application, surely, of <HI>legisla|tive</HI> power.] The speaker overruled this motion; telling the house, that it would be actionable.

<P>Mr. <HI>Ferrers,</HI> member for <HI>Plymouth,</HI> was arrested for debt, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1542, going to parliament, and carried to the Counter. The serjeant of the commons was sent to the Counter to fetch him. The people at the counter resisted the serjeant, who complained to
<PB N="215" REF="013851_0245_0F9E2AE1AC0F9E08">
the sheriffs. They took part with their officers. The serjeant returned to the house, and informed them. The commons resent highly. They rose, and went to the house of lords, to whom they related the affair. The lords and judges declared the contempt very atrocious, and referred the punishment to the commons, who returned to their house, and sent their serjeant to the sheriffs with his mace, without a writ, though the chancellor offered them one. In the mean while the sheriffs resolved to change their scheme, and deliver up Mr. <HI>Ferrers</HI> to the serjeant. The commons ordered the sheriffs to attend them, with the clerks and officers of the Counter. They likewise ordered their serjeant to take into custody <HI>White,</HI> the person who had arrested him. The sheriffs and <HI>White</HI> were sent to the Tower, the clerk of the Counter to a place, in the same prison, called Little ease, and the officer, who arrested Mr. <HI>Ferrers,</HI> and four others, to New|gate, who were not set at liberty, till the lord mayor petitioned for them <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Petyt</HI>'s MISCEL.

<P>It is notorious, that from time immemorial, the house of commons has assumed to itself a power of trying, condemning, and punishing, in cases, where <HI>itself</HI> is the offended party, and often in a very arbi|trary manner, and without due regard to the standing laws of the land. An assembly of representatives elected in an <HI>adequate</HI> manner, and holding their power a <HI>competent</HI> time, and upon the foundation of <HI>responsibility</HI> to constituents, would not have fallen into this error.</P>

<P>The commons, however, made a bad use of the people's confidence, and began to use their power in a tyrannical and oppressive manner.

He insists, that the commons have no right to imprison any, but their own members, and that only when absolutely necessary. The members know this power of the house, and voluntarily expose themselves to it, by going into the house; which other subjects do not; but claim the privilege given them by <HI>Magna Charta.</HI> He owns, likewise, that there may be some pretence for imprisoning persons not members, when guilty of breach of privilege, or contempt. [In which I think he makes too large a concession. I see not the justice, nor even the common decency of any set of men whatever (I am of opinion the two houses of parliament are but <HI>men</HI>) punishing any offence against <HI>themselves.</HI> There is no possible case, in which a <HI>jury</HI> may not decide.] Confinement by the <HI>commons alone,</HI> he observes, is an encroachment on the legislature, which consists of king, lords, and commons <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 268.</NOTE>. The commons sending the subjects to prison, even though guilty, is assuming the office of the <HI>executive,</HI> which

belongs to the <HI>king,</HI> the commons being of the <HI>legisl|lative</HI> only. A power in the commons of imprisoning is a mockery, he thinks, of the people's liberty; be|cause a free people ought to be liable to no punish|ment, but in consequence of some <HI>known</HI> standing <HI>law.</HI> Judges, and justices of the peace have a power of imprisoning in consequence of their being impowered by the king to execute the laws, which the commons are not. The commons have no need of a power to punish, because they may apply to the executive whenever a known law is violated. [Even the <HI>sove|raine</HI> cannot punish an offence against <HI>himself.</HI> The offender is tried, and condemned by <HI>indifferent</HI> per|sons, <HI>viz.</HI> judges and juries.] The house of com|mons has no power to decide concerning <HI>property</HI>; how then, he says, can it take away personal <HI>liberty,</HI> which is more valuable? He says, the power of im|prisoning was but just <HI>then</HI> assumed by the commons, and could not plead custom, or prescription. Too great a power in the house of commons, he says, may produce great mischief many ways; particularly by disgusting the people against parliamentary govern|ment, and driving them to such a proceeding as that of the <HI>Danes,</HI> who, to be free from the tyranny of their lords, made themselves slaves to their king. When there is reason, he says, to suspect a great pre|valency of bribery and corruption in the house of commons, it is time for the people to see to the <HI>re|trenching</HI> of their power; [the cutting off of <HI>court influence,</HI> he should have said] for that a corrupt house of commons may be expected to make them|selves formidable to the people, in order to be of con|sequence to the court, and to deserve the more liberal <HI>pay</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">STATE TRACTS, time of king <HI>William,</HI> III.270.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>In the case of a court of directors, established by a trading company, it is universally understood, that the directors, when once established by the proprietors, have power to do whatever the proprietors could do for the common advantage of the company, this power being still left to the explication and limitation of the proprietors.

<P>It was resolved by the commons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1689,

The king's bench goes on, however, the same year, bailing by <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> persons obnoxious to the commons. The commons order the governor of the Tower to bring before them in custody of their serjeant at arms, Sir <HI>Thomas Ienner</HI> and others, tho'

bailed before the warrant could reach them. Not giving satisfaction, on their examination before the house, a committee is appointed to prepare a charge against them.

<P>In the affair of the printers in 1770, it was argued in the house of commons, that the power of summon|ing persons before them, and punishing for refusal, is <HI>necessary</HI> for preserving the purity of elections; because, if every returning officer may proceed as he pleases, and laugh at the house of commons, there must be an end of all due election and return.

<PB N="226" REF="013851_0256_0F9E2AEB8B6CFCE0">
and man; it is, I say, notorious, that if this was the <HI>lexet consuetudo parliamenti,</HI> there would be no opportu|nity for the reflections now so commonly cast upon our house of commons, as deciding elections too much in favour of the <HI>court</HI>-candidate, and as taking upon themselves the <HI>inconsistent</HI> offices of <HI>plaintiffs, judges,</HI> and <HI>juries.</HI></P>
<P>Judge <HI>Blackstone,</HI> in his account of the unknown and <HI>unlimited</HI> power and privileges of parliament <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">COM. I 161, <HI>et seq.</HI></NOTE>, seems to forget, that the safety of the people <HI>limits</HI> all free governments. It is true that the people of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> not being accustomed, till lately, to apprehend danger from any quarter, but the <HI>throne</HI> (tyranny hav|ing been an old trick among kings from <HI>Nimrod</HI>'s time down) have all along encouraged and supported their <HI>parliaments</HI> in extending their power, as the only sure bulwark against regal encroachments. But latter ages have taught us the necessity of looking out for security against <HI>parliamentary</HI> encroachments. And, the me|thod is not by lessening the power of <HI>parliament,</HI> but by lessening the power of the <HI>court</HI> over the parliament. For a parliament is not (as a king) <HI>naturally</HI> hostile to liberty. If ever a parliament comes to oppose, or in|jure the people, it must be in consequence of an <HI>unna|tural</HI> influence acting in it. Therefore our modern male-contents seem to be in a wrong pursuit. To re|trench the power of their <HI>representatives,</HI> would be lessen|ing their <HI>own</HI> power. To break through the corrupt in|fluence of the <HI>court</HI> over their representatives, would be making them <HI>truly</HI> their representatives. Take away court-influence, and the 558 will of course pursue the interest of their country, as any other set of gentle|men
<PB N="227" REF="013851_0257_0F9E2AEC4AEA1CF8">
men would do, because their <HI>own</HI> will be involved in it, when they have no places or pensions to indemnify them. At the same time it cannot be denied, that for a house of commons, though ever so incorrupt and uninfluenced by the court, to be ever grasping at new privileges, and assuming new powers, descending from the dignity of representatives of the majesty of the people of <HI>Britain,</HI> taking upon themselves the office of the justices, prosecuting, imprisoning, and fining, a set of printers and booksellers, depriving the subjects of his trial by jury, and employing their time in hunt|ing out small offenders, while they should be battling the gigantic enemies of liberty and virtue, and plan|ning measures for making unborn millions happy; it cannot be denied, I say, that such proceedings as these are infinitely <HI>beneath</HI> the attention of a house of commons, though it should be granted, that the <HI>power</HI> of the house of commons, being the power of the <HI>peo|ple,</HI> ought not to be <HI>limited.</HI> All thing are <HI>lawful</HI> for them; but all things are not <HI>expedient.</HI> The truth of the matter is, That if our houses of commons had kept to their proper sphere, we should never have seen any <HI>libels</HI> against them, nor any <HI>occasion</HI> for prosecut|ing, imprisoning, and fining; or if there had, the <HI>courts</HI> of king's bench and common pleas were open.</P>
<P>The following passages from the Magazines shew how these assumptions of the house of commons ap|pear to the <HI>people.</HI></P>
<P><Q>It is not more known, than lamented, what an authority the house of commons has claimed over the liberty of the subject; and how numerous the instances are in our history, where, without the spe|cification of any <HI>crime,</HI> or the execution of any <HI>war|rant,</HI> they have <HI>voted</HI> a freeman of <HI>England</HI> into

<HI>prison,</HI> and kept him closely confined for <HI>weeks,</HI> nay <HI>months,</HI> to the irreparable injury, perhaps, of him and his family. To aggravate the cruelty of the pro|cedure, they have even voted every body who offered to procure him the least <HI>justice,</HI> an <HI>enemy</HI> to his country; and deemed it to the last degree unpar|donable, that he should have recourse to those very <HI>laws,</HI> for satisfaction, which they <HI>themselves</HI> had esta|blished for his redress. The privilege thus claimed by the house of commons is no less repugnant to the <HI>laws</HI> of this kingdom, than it is opposite to reason and <HI>nature:</HI> if then we are desirous of restraining the servants of the <HI>crown</HI> from the exercise of an arbitrary authority, whence comes it that we have never en|deavoured to restrain our <HI>own</HI> immediate <HI>servants</HI> from the exercise of a tyranny practised a thousand times more frequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, and infinitely more replete with slavery and destruction <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">LOND.

V.15.</NOTE>, and many other writers, make a great matter of the houses of parliament being the <HI>sole</HI> judges of whatever concerns their <HI>own</HI> houses respectively, because they are the <HI>supreme</HI> court, and no other court can intermeddle with their affairs. And it is, by the same able writer, and others, taken for granted, that every court is to be <HI>sole</HI> judge of its <HI>own</HI> privileges, and of offences committed against itself.</P>
<P>There is no doubt concerning the supremacy of parliament, and that therefore no inferior court can, of its own authority, claim the decision of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffe|rences between the houses, or between one house and a supposed offender, or offenders against that house. But there is certainly a power in either house to <HI>refer</HI> to the decision of others any matter, wherein the <HI>house</HI> is itself a <HI>party.</HI> And it will then become lawful for those, to whom the <HI>reference</HI> is made, to <HI>decide.</HI></P>
<P>It does not appear to me, that there is any thing <HI>humiliating</HI> in submitting to the decision, or arbitra|tion, of a set of men, whether in or out of parliament, or that it necessarily implies acknowledging a <HI>superi|ority</HI> in those men. In a dispute between the king and a merchant, neither one nor the other thinks himself <HI>degraded</HI> by having the cause tried by the court of King's Bench, and the point determined by a jury. The cause must be tried in that court first, and cannot come before the lords, but by appeal. And even when it is finally determined by the lords, is the sove|reign <HI>degraded</HI> by submitting to the decision of his <HI>inferiors?</HI> The <HI>lords</HI> are as much his inferiors after, as before. What could be nobler, than to see a man

of high rank and large fortune decline to pronounce in a dispute between himself and one of his domestics, and leaving the matter to arbitration of his other domestics?</P>
<P>Supposing the house of commons elected in an ade|quate manner, that is, every member by about 400 men of property, I say that in submitting to their arbitration, a member would submit to his undoubted <HI>superiors</HI> in every respect. If every member submits, the <HI>house</HI> submits to their <HI>constituents.</HI> And surely it could be no <HI>degradation</HI> for them to submit a point of honour or ceremony, a matter of no national conse|quence, to their political <HI>creators,</HI> from whom they derive their very <HI>existence</HI> as a <HI>house.</HI></P>
<P>Supposing it granted, that there is a <HI>difficulty</HI> either way, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether parliament takes into its <HI>own</HI> hands the punishment of offences against itself, or leaves it to arbitration by <HI>others,</HI> will any man pre|tend, that the difficulties are <HI>equal</HI> on both sides? Nay, will not any man acknowledge that in declining to be judges in their <HI>own</HI> cause, there is <HI>magnani|mity</HI>; as on the contrary (in all private disputes at least) there is much <HI>selfishness</HI> and <HI>arrogance</HI> in claim|ing to decide our <HI>own</HI> quarrels.</P>
<P>It is usually said, there are <HI>customs</HI> of parliament and other courts, which <HI>themselves</HI> only understand. Are then the customs of parliament and other courts only to be explained by algebra, fluxions, or the higher geometry? Or are they matters of plain <HI>common sense?</HI> If they be not, the most innocent and uprightly-inten|tioned subject may fall into the great and dangerous guilt of offending against those <HI>inexplicable</HI> customs and privileges, and may find himself suddenly in the same condition with the unfortunate sailor dashed on unseen breakers in an open sea, swallowed up and lost.</P>

<P>The power of the house of commons to send even their <HI>own</HI> members (much more other subjects) to prison without tryal by jury, is to the last degree dangerous.

This could not be, if every person, whether member or not, offending, or supposed to offend, against the orders of the house, were to be tried, before he could be committed, by a jury of those, who are in every respect <HI>equal</HI> to the members, I mean the <HI>people,</HI> the <HI>constituents</HI> of the members.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Parliamentary Privileges and Prosecutions have been too generally frivolous and unjust.</HEAD>
<P>TO prove that parliamentary privileges and pro|secutions are grievances, I will add here a few, out of a great many instances I had col|lected in the course of my reading, of parliamentary prosecutions, very much unworthy the dignity of parliament, which will shew, that it is not easy for men going out of their proper sphere to act suitably, nor to exclude <HI>passion</HI> and <HI>prejudice</HI> from their decisions in their <HI>own</HI> cause.</P>
<P>In fact, the liberty and property of free-born <HI>Eng|lishmen</HI> are things of too sacred a nature to lie open to invasion, from the sudden resolutions of any set of men whatever. And yet greater depredations have not been committed, than those which the liberty and property of <HI>Englishmen</HI> have suffered, at the hands of kings and ministers, who have been artful enough to prevail with parliaments (naturally friendly to li|berty) to become the instruments of their tyranny.</P>
<P>Some members of parliament, in the time of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary, A. D.</HI> 1555, made a secession. Some were indicted and fined; others traversed; but the point was not decided, when the queen died.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Taylor,</HI> barrister at law, a member, was brought on his knees in the house, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1631, for saying, that the parliament had committed murder with the sword of justice, in the case of <HI>Strafford.</HI> He was ex|pelled the house, and voted incapable of ever sitting more.

<P>In the time of <HI>Iam.</HI> I. the year not mentioned, a member, for seeming to reflect on another member, as puritanical and factious, was called to the bar, and on his knees discharged the service of the house, with an intimation, that his sentence was very merciful, because they might have imprisoned him besides <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 79.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The commons, afraid of <HI>Lilburn</HI>'s party and the levellers, made them close prisoners in the Tower; but this severe order was countermanded afterwards <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST.

<Q>A bill of attainder, a member said on that occasion, is an extraordinary thing, and never used, but upon extraordinary occasions&mdash;Parliament may declare that to be a crime, which was deemed no crime before it was committed, and surely they may determine what they will admit as evidence of a crime.</Q>

Several lords protested against his attainder, because bills of attainder against persons in prison, and who are therefore to be tried by law, are of dan|gerous consequence to the subjects and constitution; because the evidence of grand jury-men and petty jury-men, not given before the peers, was admitted, though they disagreed in their test; because informa|tion in writing was received, which prevents the wit|ness being cross examined; because <HI>Fenwick</HI> was cast by one witness only, and him a doubtful one; and because <HI>Fenwick</HI> was not considerable enough to be proceeded against in so extraordinary and irregular a manner, justifiable only in cases of great danger. <HI>Fenwick,</HI> however, was beheaded on Tower-hill, denying to the last, all concern in the assassination plot, though he owned himself a jacobite <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P>There never was perhaps an instance of so trifling an affair producing such weighty consequences, as that of <HI>Sacheverel, A. D.</HI> 1709. One would have imagined, that twenty silly bigots might have preached twenty capucinades each, and this great kingdom have

<P>A wise government will always consider maturely, which of two measures, is likely to produce the greatest good, and the least harm. But surely this thought never once entered the heads of the then ministry. For, it was manifest, on one hand, that <HI>Sacheverel</HI>'s sermon was too mean a performance to produce, of itself, any effect.

the way. To return: In the case of the printers, who published the debates of the house of commons, <HI>A.

On the contrary, the lord mayor and aldermen of <HI>London</HI> protected the printers, and obliged the person, who apprehended them, to find securities to answer for his offence. And the printers <HI>continued</HI> to publish the debates. One of the alder|men wrote to the secretary of state an account of his proceeding. And the accused printer sent the speaker the opinion of council upon the house's proceeding and the royal proclamation, <HI>viz.</HI> That both were illegal, unconstitutional, and void.

<P>This whole proceeding of the house of commons, was condemned by many both within and without doors. And it may be affirmed, that the people of <HI>England</HI> will never, while a spark of the fire of liberty remains, be reconciled to an assumed power in <HI>repre|sentatives</HI>

<P>It has been said,
<Q>How are the commons to obtain the informations necessary for making laws, or en|quiring into the conduct of ministers, if they cannot <HI>oblige</HI> persons to <HI>attend?</HI></Q>
The answer is, They cer|tainly cannot, and therefore <HI>ought</HI> to have a power of compelling attendance as the <HI>courts</HI> have. But this has nothing to do with their assuming a power of imprisoning those who <HI>do attend,</HI> or would if their attendance was required for any other purpose than that of <HI>punishing</HI> them. In fact, no inconvenience could arise, but, on the contrary, great advantage, from every court's giving up what the king must give up, <HI>viz.</HI> The claim of judging and punishing pre|tended contempts, or other offences, against <HI>them|selves.</HI> It is a whimsical part of our political oecono|my, that, if any person, or body of the subjects offends the house of <HI>commons,</HI> they take the matter into their <HI>own</HI> hands, and punish with fine and impri|sonment. But if a minister has offended against the <HI>people,</HI> the commons can only impeach him before the <HI>upper</HI> house. The commons <HI>themselves</HI> punish offences against <HI>themselves</HI>; which one would rather suppose they would refer to <HI>others</HI>; and they refer to <HI>others</HI> the punishment of offenders against the <HI>people,</HI> whose guardians they are, which one would rather suppose they would keep in their <HI>own</HI> hands. The truth is, the proper function of the house of com|mons is twofold, <HI>viz. Inquisitorial,</HI> and <HI>legislative</HI>; but they are ever running into the <HI>executive,</HI> which is no part of their office.</P>
<P>It was argued, in defence of the lord mayor, on the same occasion, That the <HI>courts</HI> of law have power

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of excluding the People from the house of Commons, and punishing those who publish the Speeches made there.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER consequence of the inadequate state of parliamentary representation, and of too long parliaments, is a dangerous power assumed by the commons, of clearing their house, and excluding their constituents from the satisfaction of knowing how their deputies behave themselves, and whether they consult the public interest, or play the game into the hands of the ministry. Upon the same principle they found the practice of punishing all per|sons, who publish any speeches made in their house.</P>
<P>As to the house of lords, supposing it once granted, that it is wise to allow any set of men a power of con|sulting for themselves, without regard to the public, and putting a <HI>negative</HI> upon the most salutary national proposals, if thought by <HI>them</HI> likely to entrench upon their particular privileges (a point, the proof of which I should be sorry to have imposed on me) supposing, I say, a house of lords upon the foot of the <HI>British,</HI> it follows, that they have a right to exclude all, but peers, from their deleberations; because they are do|ing their <HI>own</HI> business, and not the public; they are acting for <HI>themselves,</HI> and are principals, and not deputies.</P>
<P>But surely the faithful representatives of the <HI>people,</HI> cannot dread the <HI>people</HI>'s knowledge of their proceed|ings in the house. An aristocracy of persons, whose interest may be different from that of the people, a court of inquisition, or a <HI>Venetian</HI> council of Ten,
<PB N="257" REF="013851_0287_0F9E2B0B2E0D4A98">
might be expected to shut themselves from the sight of the people, but not a house of representatives assem|bled, by the people's order, to do the people's business. How are the people to know which of their delegates are faithful, and ought to be trusted again, or which otherwise, if they are to be excluded the house?</P>
<P>Even in the house of peers, this custom has been blamed.</P>
<P><Q>It is not, my lords, said the earl of <HI>Chesterfield</HI> on this subject, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1740, by excluding all sorts of strangers that you are to preserve the antient dignity of this assembly: it is by excluding all manner of quibbling, impertinence, deceit, weakness, and cor|ruption. These, I hope, are strangers here: I hope your lordships will take care never to admit any one of them within these walls; but by excluding other strangers, when you have nothing of a secret nature under consideration you will only raise a jealousy of the dignity of your proceedings; and if this jea|lousy should become general, without doors, you will in vain seek for respect among the people <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P>There were many strangers in the gallery of the house of peers, on occasion of the enquiry into lord <HI>Peterborough</HI>'s conduct in <HI>Spain, A. D.</HI> 1711.

<P>The commons, <HI>A.

The duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> opposed the shutting of the house of peers, and said, it was for the honour of

<P>It was common in former times for the <HI>members</HI> themselves to publish their speeches made in the house.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of Absentees from the House, and Members neglecting Parliamentary Business.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER evil arising from the miserably in|adequate state of representation and consequent contempt, which members acquire for their constituents, is, their taking the liberty of <HI>absenting</HI> themselves for frivolous or no reasons, and of attend|ing very <HI>carelessly</HI> to the business of the nation, when they come to the house. Did a gentleman recollect, that at his election he received an <HI>aweful charge</HI> from an <HI>august</HI> meeting of 5000 of his countrymen, and gave a solemn <HI>promise</HI> sealed with the religion of an <HI>oath</HI> to be <HI>diligent</HI> and <HI>faithful</HI> in discharging the mo|mentous trust then committed to him, and did he know, that those who <HI>employed</HI> him, would <HI>censure</HI> him publicly, if they found, that he did any body's business in parliament but <HI>theirs</HI>; he would tremble at the thought of trifling with so sacred a function. But when a youth just come from <HI>Oxford,</HI> remembers, that he was elected (as it is called) by a few <HI>drunken idiots</HI> in a paltry <HI>borough,</HI> and carried round the town in an old oaken chair, and that he has his place as he has his estate, or that he gave every voter <HI>five guineas</HI>; it is no wonder, that he considers the whole as a very paltry <HI>farce,</HI> which he may <HI>attend</HI> to, or <HI>neglect,</HI> as he <HI>pleases.</HI></P>
<P>It is supposed that members of parliament have often done the business of a corrupt <HI>court</HI> by <HI>seasonably</HI> playing <HI>truant.</HI> Those gentlemen shew themselves not abandoned to all sense of shame. When the pub|lic has been betrayed by a villainous vote for an aug|mentation

Why were they not upon <HI>duty,</HI> taking care of their <HI>country?</HI> Ah! if a man loves his young and beauti|ful wife, and regards his honour, he will not leave her in the hands of a known rake; or if he loves his <HI>money,</HI> he will not leave his strong box open to a thievish servant <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See CATO'S LETT.

The famous amend|ment by the lords to the bill of <HI>Ian.</HI> 27. 1702, by which amendment it was made high treason to attempt to set aside the protestant succession in the house of <HI>Hanover</HI> in case of queen <HI>Anne's</HI> leaving no posterity, was carried by only one vote, 118 to 117 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P>The ruinous act in favour of the <HI>French</HI> trade, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1713, was thrown out by only <HI>nine</HI> votes, <HI>viz.</HI> 194&punc; against 185 <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. V.40.</NOTE>. Only 9 true <HI>Englishmen</HI> in the house!</P>

<P>TWO weaknesses in human nature have produced bribery, corruption, and many other wicked arts; I mean, the love of <HI>power,</HI> and the love of <HI>money.</HI> In antient times men in superior sta|tions were drawn into many of their bad practices by the <HI>former.</HI> The latter is <HI>our</HI> disease, and a lousy disease (I ask the reader's pardon) it is.

<P>It is difficult to exclude corruption. Where there is any thing worth striving about, such creatures as men commonly are, will use indirect means for at|taining it.</P>

more than the <HI>difficulty</HI> of living a <HI>virtuous</HI> life amidst the various temptations, to which our frail nature is exposed, is a reason for our giving over all endeavours to regulate our conduct by the strict laws of <HI>morality.</HI> On the contrary, we <HI>must resolve</HI> to live a life of vir|tue, however <HI>difficult</HI> it may be, or we are <HI>undone</HI> as <HI>individuals</HI>; and we must root corruption out of the state, or we are undone as a <HI>nation.</HI></P>

and giving him power to do infinite mischief, for which he is not <HI>responsible</HI> or <HI>punishable.</HI></P>
<P>Bad ministers, in our times, thrust themselves into power chiefly with a design o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> filling their <HI>pockets,</HI> and advancing their families and friends. And it is much to be lamented, that there is such ample <HI>oppor|tunity</HI> for them to gratify their exorbitant desires. It is universally allowed, that a <HI>British</HI> ministry has the disposal of <HI>several millions</HI> annually of the public mo|ney. And the reader may judge what opportunity there must be for them to chip off fragments and cor|ners from such prodigious masses, without the pub|lic's being ever acquainted with facts in so particular a manner as to <HI>convict</HI> a minister, or his tools, of the plunder they have committed.</P>
<P>As parliament is the natural <HI>check</HI> upon the wicked measures of <HI>kings</HI> and <HI>courts,</HI> parliaments must be <HI>managed</HI> to obtain their <HI>connivance</HI> at the proceedings of kings and courts. Therefore in former times the court not being possessed of the necessary funds, <HI>wheedled,</HI> or <HI>bullied</HI> them; now they make use of (what they think the surer means, <HI>viz.</HI>) bribing and <HI>buying</HI> them. And our ministers, since the revolu|lution, have carried this liberal art so far, as to study <HI>no other</HI> system of politics, or government, than find|ing out <HI>proper</HI> men for their purpose, and filling the house of <HI>commons</HI> with them; and the whole differ|ence between one ministry and another, is that one junto has a <HI>better</HI> knack at <HI>managing parliaments</HI> than another.</P>
<P>The chief materials, by which a minister keeps up an ascendency in parliament, are, 1. The prodigious sums of public <HI>money,</HI> of which he has the disposal. 2. The innumerable <HI>places</HI> in the customs, excise, salt-duty, &amp;c. and in the navy, army and church,
<PB N="270" REF="013851_0300_0F9E2A451F80CDD8">
the greatest part of which are at the disposal of the minister.</P>
<P><HI>Latter</HI> times have thrown into the ministerial scale a weight <HI>unknown</HI> to former ages; I mean the <HI>na|tional debt.</HI> The <HI>anixety</HI> of the public creditors, the proprietors of the funds, about public <HI>credit,</HI> is a powerful cause of their shewing a <HI>reluctance</HI> against all proposals for salutary <HI>alterations,</HI> or <HI>restorations.</HI> But their reasonings on this subject are not sounder than it would be for the inhabitant of a crazy building to oppose all repairs, and to insist, that the best way for <HI>preventing</HI> his mansion from coming in ruins upon his head, is to <HI>let it fall.</HI> Of which more fully hereafter.</P>
<P>The revenue of the <HI>civil list,</HI> which is nominally 800,000<HI>l. per annum,</HI> but, by means of a demand from time to time of half a million to pay off its pre|tended deficiencies or debts, is really near a million (in the last reign it often exceeded a million) must throw a <HI>prodigious power</HI> into the hands of those who have the disposal of it.</P>
<P>A million <HI>per annum</HI> would maintain 200 dukes, at 5000<HI>l.</HI> a year each, or 250 earls at 4000 a year each, or 1000 gentlemen at 1000<HI>l.</HI> a year each. It would support arts, manufactures, and commerce to the in|conceivable advantage of the public, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But the <HI>civil list</HI> revenue is not reckoned above one <HI>third</HI> part of what a minister has in his disposal. It is not therefore to be wondered, that a minister has great influence in parliament. If one considers into how many purses, of 100 guineas each, the prodigi|ous sum of three millions may be divided, at first glance one would conclude, that a minister could give such a purse to every man upon the island.</P>

[<HI>Walpole</HI>'s excise scheme] that the less needs to be said on the subject here. If we consider in the increase of taxes, first, the increase of <HI>officers,</HI> by which a vast number of new dependants on the crown are erected in every part of the kingdom, (dependants as numerous, and cer|tainly more prevalent, than all the tenants and wards of the crown were antiently) and, secondly, the <HI>power</HI> given to the treasury and other <HI>inferior</HI> officers, on account of these taxes, which are at least as great and as grievous in this <HI>free</HI> government of ours, as any that are exercised in the most <HI>arbi|trary</HI> government on the same occasions; if we con|sider this alone, we shall find reason sufficient to conclude that, although the power of prerogative was more open and more <HI>noisy</HI> in its operations, yet the power thus acquired is more real and may prove more <HI>dangerous,</HI> for this very reason, because it is more covered and more <HI>silent.</HI> That men began to see, very soon after the revolution, the danger aris|ing from hence to our constitution, as I said above, is most certain.

<P>OUR courtly gentlemen labour to persuade us, that parliamentary corruption has never been that <HI>formidable</HI> evil our patriots have repre|sented it. Facts are stubborn.

<P><PB N="279" REF="013851_0309_0F9E2A4FB112AAF8">Ministerial artifice, for corrupting parliaments, has been applied in too ways, 1 To <HI>over-ruling elections,</HI> and 2. To <HI>byassing</HI> the votes of <HI>members</HI> in the <HI>house.</HI></P>
<P>To shew the good people of <HI>Britain</HI> how their great and weighty concerns are managed, I will give a brief acco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt of some remarkable controverted elections, and facts relating to that subject, which have occurred to me in the course of my reading, with reflections.</P>
<P><Q>The duty of a member of parliament</Q>
(says the brave <HI>Lucas</HI> of <HI>Ireland</HI>)
<Q>is infinitely the <HI>most impor|tant</HI> that can devolve upon a subject <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">LOND. MAG. 1767, p. 565.</NOTE>.</Q>
Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">On GOV. p. 2. &sect; 222.</NOTE> ranks it among those breaches of trust in the exe|cutive magistrate, which amount to a <HI>dissolution</HI> of <HI>government,</HI> <Q>if he employs the force, treasure, and offices of the society to <HI>corrupt</HI> the <HI>representatives,</HI> or openly to <HI>pre-engage</HI> the <HI>electors,</HI> and prescribe what manner of persons shall be chosen.</Q> To regulate candidates and electors, and new model the ways of election, what is it, but to <HI>cut up</HI> the <HI>govern|ment</HI> by the <HI>roots,</HI> and poison the very fountain of public security.</P>
<P>'Some call the attendance in parliament a <HI>burden,</HI> says Sir <HI>Thomas Littleton</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. III.381.</NOTE>.
<Q>If it be a burden, it is such a burden as some men spend a great part of their estates for, as if it was a <HI>privilege.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In modern times, every body is rushing into the house of commons. In former days, it was a pri|vilege to be exempted from the burden of being elected, or contributing to the wages of members <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Elsy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ge.</HI> 79.</NOTE>, Does not this fact alone demonstrate, that those
<PB N="280" REF="013851_0310_0F9E2A50C5CC92C8">
who strive to get into the house, intend the filling of their pockets merely? It was as much, and more, an <HI>honour</HI> to be in parliament in former times, than in ours; but it was not so <HI>lucrative.</HI> Does any man <HI>buy</HI> without a view of <HI>selling?</HI> And how are the buyers of seats in parliament to re-imburse them|selves; but out of the plunder of a wretched and almost bankrupt nation?

<P>A humourous writer in one of the news-papers pro|posed, at the commencement of the last general election, that as it is vain to think of excluding bribery, it might be a considerable improvement, if we were to lay aside, at every general election, all canvassing, eating, drinking, kissing voters wives and daughters, quarrelling and idleness, and that the people should go on with their business as usual, till the very day came. That an act should be made abolishing all the laws in being against corruption at elections, and that from and after such a day, it should be lawful for the con|testing candidates to go to the place of election with <HI>purses</HI> of guineas in their hands and fairly <HI>purchase</HI> the voters, openly bidding against each other as at an auction.</P>
<P>We have an election-oath, by which every elector if called upon, is obliged to swear, that he has re|ceived nothing for his vote. But the intention of it (though it were likely to be atherwise useful) is most commonly defeated by the <HI>candidates agreeing</HI> to <HI>wave</HI> the <HI>ceremony.</HI> Who can give a reason why every member is not at his first <HI>entrance</HI> into the house obli|ged, at the hazard of the punishment of perjury, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o swear, that he has taken no <HI>illegal</HI> steps to gain his e|lection, and at the end of every session, that he has not been <HI>influenced</HI> by the court or ministry in any one <HI>vote</HI> he has given?</P>

His election was held void by the clerk of the crown, because he was an outlaw. The commons decline giving the lords any account of their proceedings, but proposed to send messages to the king; who, in fact, had no more to do with the matter, than the lords<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PARL.

The lords sent again to the house, that the king thouht himself concerned, that there should be a conference. The reason of the king's interesting himself so par|ticularly in this election, was, his thinking his direction (which he had no right to give in an <HI>authoritative</HI> manner, though undoubtedly it was found <HI>advice</HI>) not to elect any outlaw, was despised, in the house's de|claring <HI>Goodwin</HI> duly elected.

The speaker informs the king, that <HI>Goodwin</HI>'s election was duly carried on, and consequently <HI>For|tescue</HI>'s void. That the outlawries against <HI>Goodwin</HI> were only for debt; and that he had sat unquestioned in several parliaments since the outlawry had passed upon him; and that, besides, it was not strictly plead|able, because of deficiencies in formality. they mention <HI>Smith,</HI> 1 <HI>Eliz.

The king holds all these precedents for nothing. The house, he said, derived its privilege from him, which therefore ought not to be turned against him. He pretended, that the court of chan|cery ought to judge of elections and returns. Quoted a precedent of 35 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. when all the judges agreed, that outlawry is a cause of expulsion from the house. The king still insists on a conference between the commons and judges, and that the house report the result to the privy-council. The commons propose to make a law, that no outlawed person hereafter sit in the house, and to confer with the judges, not to re|verse what they had done, but that they might profit by the judges learning, and that they might satisfy the king. It was said, that there was no precedent of a member's being deprived of privilege on account of outlawry. Others of the commons were strong against all conference. That parliament had contradicted the opinions of the judges concerning outlaws, since the time of <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. They sent the king their reasons against all conference.

parliament, not to chancery, and that the power of hearing and determining concerning elections was always supposed to be exclusively in the house Of which they brought many precedents, and alleged, that if the chancery were to judge concerning elec|tions, they would soon be masters of the commons. They made apologies abundantly for offending the king.
<Q>Not doubting, say they, though we were but a part of a body, as to the making of new laws, yet for any matter of privileges of our own house, that we are, and ever have been, a court of ourselves, of sufficient power to discern and determine without their lordships, as their lordships have always used to do for theirs without us <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PARL.

The king still ob|jects to the absurdity of giving <HI>legislative</HI> power to an <HI>outlaw.</HI> They answer, that, notwithstanding precedents for outlaws sitting in the house, they were determined, in compliance with his majesty's sense, to make a law for preventing it for the future; but that this law cannot operate against <HI>Goodwin,</HI> being <HI>ex post facto</HI>; besides the want of formality in his outlawry, which rendered it null and void, and its being only upon mean process, and two general pardons issuing since it passed upon him, which, at any rate, would have cleared him. The commons meanly request the intercession of the lords with the king, as having nearer access to his person; and send a committee of their house to them with their apology to the king. The lords ask the committee, if they may read the paper? The committee agrees. The lords ask, if they may amplify, explain, or debate, concerning any doubtful point? The committee answer, They have no warrant from the house for that. The paper is read. The speaker attends the king at 8 in the morn|ing.

The house orders, that the com|mittee shall only insist on the support, and explication of the reasons already given, and not proceed to any other argument, or answer. Sir <HI>Francis Bacon,</HI> in his report, flatters the king's wisdom shamefully. It was observed, that there had been no such concession made by the commons, to any king since the conquest.

<P><Q>It is too notorious, what attempts are now car|rying on to invade the freedom of your approaching elections; in some places by <HI>threats,</HI> to fill and over-awe them with the quartering of <HI>troops,</HI> if they do not comply; in others by the corrupt sollicita|tions of <HI>agents</HI> and undertakers employed by those, who from the incredible sums which are dispersed, one must imagine, have <HI>more</HI> than <HI>private</HI> purses at their command.

What other construction can any man, in common sense, put upon all these things, but that there seems to have been formed a design, by violence and oppression, first to <HI>humble</HI> you, and to make your necks pliable to the yoke that is de|signed for you, and then to finish the work by tempt|ing the <HI>poverty</HI> and necessities of the people to sell <HI>themselves</HI> into the most abject and detestable slavery, for that very money, which had been either unneces|sarily raised, or mercilesly and unjustly plundered and torn from their very bowels? And thus you may be in a fair way of being subdued by your <HI>own</HI> weapons. Nor can I imagine what inducement men can have who run from borough to borough, and purchase their elec|tions at such extravagant rates, unless it be from a strong expectation of being well repaid for their <HI>votes,</HI> and of receiving ample <HI>recompence</HI> and rewards for the <HI>secret services</HI> they h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve covenanted to per|form here.

likely so soon to overtake them. It is for these purposes that this bill is now before you, and I hope it either is, or by your assistance will be made, such as may fully answer the ends for which you were pleased to order it to be brought in.</Q>

<Q>We know, that persons heretofore have not only bribed the returning officer, but have even <HI>indemnified</HI> him against the whole <HI>penalty</HI> of 500 <HI>l.</HI> rather than not get the return, right or wrong, in favour of them|selves; depending. I suppose, upon the strength and partiality of their friends to maintain them at any rate in the unjustifiable <HI>possession</HI> of a <HI>seat</HI> here; this has been practised upon former occasions, and therefore there are always just grounds to suspect it will be attempted again. And it is now come to such a pass, that if you were even to <HI>double</HI> that <HI>penalty,</HI> without doing something <HI>else,</HI> I am afraid it would have little or no effect. But when all these <HI>bonds</HI> of <HI>indemnity</HI> are declared <HI>null</HI> and <HI>void,</HI> when the securities usually given and taken upon these occasions are withdrawn, they may then perhaps be <HI>deterred,</HI> at least from so <HI>barefaced</HI> a practice of these arbitrary and illegal proceedings for the future.</Q></P>

<P>On this occasion, Mr. <HI>Potter</HI> (son of the archbi|shop) spoke as follows: <Q>Mr. Speaker, I rise-up to do myself justice: For as I look upon the matter contained in this petition to be of the utmost <HI>impor|tance</HI> to the <HI>honour</HI> of the <HI>house,</HI> and even to the <HI>ex|istence</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>parliament</HI>; and as to my very great amaze|ment, I see this question treated with the greatest <HI>contempt</HI> and <HI>ridicule</HI> by an hon. gentleman, whose weight may perhaps persuade a majority to be of his opinion, I think I owe it to myself to declare my sen|timents on this great occasion by something more than the vote which I shall give. I hope, Sir, things are not yet come to such a pass, as to make it neces|sary for any man to go about to prove that the con|stitution is destroyed, whenever this house shall lose its <HI>independency.</HI> After all the noble <HI>struggles</HI> made in the house by great patriots, after all the <HI>laws</HI> passed by the legislature to preserve that independen|cy, I should hope, that out of <HI>decency,</HI> as well as out of regard to truth, I may be allowed to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gue upon that as upon an indubitable maxim. The represen|tatives of the people, when they are chosen to that office, have been said to be <HI>independent,</HI> even on their <HI>constituents</HI>; how necessary then, Sir, is it for this house to take care that there be no <HI>other</HI> improper, or
<PB N="302" REF="013851_0332_0F9E2A66B42A0100">
<HI>corrupt dependency?</HI> But, Sir, if the <HI>ministers</HI> are to be allowed to <HI>nominate</HI> to the burghs the persons who shall be their representatives, how are we to expect an <HI>independent</HI> parliament? That ministers may endea|vour to subvert this independency, that they may think it even necessary to their own <HI>security,</HI> to corrupt par|liament, we have too much reason to know. But, Sir, whatever pains former ministers may have taken for this purpose, what undue methods soever they may have used to gain to themselves a corrupt majority in this house, I believe history is not able to produce a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> instance equal to the present of a <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>great statesman</HI> taking upon himself the <HI>honourable</HI> employ|ment of being an <HI>agent</HI> at a <HI>burgh.</HI> It was not enough signify his commands by his underlings; it was not e|nough to solicit votes in his own person. The voters, it seems, could not be trusted out of his presence, and therefore, they were to be <HI>attended</HI> even to the <HI>poll.</HI> But, Sir, this great humility and condescension in a minister, would, in former times, have been construed a most notorious invasion of the rights of the people, and of the privileges of this house. And, Sir, what will the people say to us? Or what will they think of our independency, if we are not as jealous of <HI>their</HI> rights, and as tenacious of <HI>our own</HI> privileges as any of our predecessors have been? What will they think, Sir, if after seeing one parliament dissolved in a new unprecedented, I had almost said an unconstitutional manner, they shall be told, that the ministers have been nominating their representatives in the next even without the ceremony of a <HI>cong&eacute; d'elire?</HI> But, Sir, still farther; What will they think, if they shall be told that this <HI>proceeding</HI> of the minister has been laid before the house of commons, and that

the house of commons will not, or <HI>dare</HI> not <HI>cen|sure</HI> him? There have been times when no man was thought <HI>too great</HI> to be <HI>accountable</HI> to <HI>this house</HI> for his conduct; and I could give an instance even in my own memory of a great and able states|man, whose long administration was an honour and benefit to his county, and whose conduct this house thought fit to enquire into by the most severe scru|tiny&mdash;When I first heard the petition read at your table, I could hardly believe it possible that the alle|gations it contained were founded upon <HI>truth.</HI> I expected to have heard the friends of the noble person who is the object of it, boldly <HI>denying</HI> the <HI>charge,</HI> and calling loudly upon the accusers to justify it; I was determined not to believe it, unless supported by the strongest proof. But, Sir, how great was my amazement when I heard an honourable gentleman, [<HI>W. Pitt,</HI> Esq.]
who was privy to the whole trans|action, not only <HI>admitting</HI> every fact alledged to be <HI>true,</HI> but openly <HI>avowing</HI> and attempting to <HI>justify</HI> them? In what light they may appear to him, Sir, he can best tell you. But to me it seems most manifest, that as the conduct complained of was the greatest <HI>injury</HI> that could be done to our <HI>privileges,</HI> the attempt to <HI>justify</HI> it is the greatest insult upon our <HI>understanding.</HI> In what other light, Sir, can it ap|pear to us, than as the last and utmost effort of one who was determined at any rate to procure a <HI>majority</HI> in this house of persons <HI>attached</HI> to <HI>himself,</HI> his own creatures, the tools of his power? I wish to God, Sir, nothing may happen to-day to give the people room to suspect that he has been <HI>too successful.</HI> What more could he have done?

even within the walls of this house to direct our determinations? After what he has done&mdash;I should not wonder, Sir, if he did come and take that chair, and tell you, as we were told formerly, that your mace was a bauble, and that you should keep it only while you please him. Your <HI>mace,</HI> Sir, is a <HI>bauble,</HI> and so is every other <HI>ensign</HI> of <HI>authority,</HI> unless you can preserve your <HI>independency.</HI> A dependence upon the crown, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir, would in the end prove fatal to our liberties; but a dependence upon the <HI>minister,</HI> as it is infinitely more <HI>dishonourable,</HI> is infinitely more <HI>dangerous.</HI> One might suppose, Sir, some <HI>security</HI> to a <HI>people</HI> from the <HI>honour</HI> of a crowned head, and from the solid <HI>compacts</HI> that are made between the <HI>people</HI> and their <HI>sovereign.</HI> I know of no compacts that are or can be made between a minister and the people. I can suppose too, Sir, that in some future time a minister may arise profligate enough to carry his views s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> high as to attempt to make both <HI>king</HI> and <HI>people subservient</HI> to his own ambition. I can imagine such a one, Sir, taking advantage of some general calamity or time of general confusion, by a <HI>corrupt</HI> parliamentary <HI>influence</HI> oppressing even the <HI>king</HI> upon his throne, and making the crowned head a prisoner in his closet. I can imagine him, Sir, so blown up with folly and self-conceit, as to become a competitor even with those who shall be of royal blood for posts of dignity or titles of honour; and he may, Sir, (it is hardly possible indeed) but he may even prostitute the name of the crown to sup|port his pretensions. This, Sir, I say is a picture which I can draw in my own mind of the miserable situa|tion of this country if ever the <HI>parliament</HI> should become <HI>dependent</HI> on a <HI>minister.</HI> But as this can never happen but in some time of general infatuation
<PB N="305" REF="013851_0335_0F9E2A699BB32FC0">
or general corruption, the wisdom and virtue of the present age scarce secure us from seeing it otherwise than in imagination: but, Sir, whatever I see, or whatever I feel, God forbid that by an act or vote of mine, I should make the way easy for such miseries to overwhelm any future generation. The honour|able gentleman was pleased to say that this was a new case, and that there was no precedent upon our journals to guide our proceedings: but let it be remembered, that this can never be the case again, since the vote of to-day will remain upon our books an eternal precedent to posterity, and a law to this house for the future. For God's sake then, Sir, let us consider a little what sort of a law we are going to make; let us remember that if the present transaction passes uncensured, and is declared free from guilt, we may hereafter see every peer of par|liament, every secretary and other officer of state, every chancellor of the exchequer, with his <HI>treasury bags</HI> under his arm, <HI>attending</HI> and <HI>soliciting elections</HI>; and when they shall be called upon in this house to justify their proceedings, they shall tell you, they have done nothing but what they had a right to do, and that such was the opinion of this wise, this independent, this freely elected parliament. Sir, I am not one of those persons, who will ever be for extending the privileges of this house to any ridicu|lous or romantic degree: if I could but persuade myself that there was the least room to doubt upon this occasion, I should think that humanity obliged me to put the mildest construction. But really, Sir, I think the <HI>insult</HI> offered to the house is of so <HI>flagrant</HI> a nature, I think the <HI>precedent</HI> must prove so <HI>dangerous</HI> to the honour and <HI>indepen|dency</HI>

of <HI>parliament,</HI> I think the consequences must be so destructive to the <HI>constitution</HI> as to deserve and demand the <HI>severest</HI> animadversion. The honourable gentleman was pleased to ask, What is the object of the petition?

<P>The case of a double return from the borough of <HI>Milborn-Port</HI> came under consideration, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1747. <HI>Michael Harvey</HI> and <HI>Ieffry French,</HI> Esqrs. and <HI>Thomas Medlycott</HI> and <HI>Charles Churchill,</HI> Esqrs. were returned. This being a borough by prescription, according to the ancient usage and custom thereof, there have always been in it nine capital bailiffs, who hold their respective offices by virtue of deputations granted by the proprietors of nine ancient parcels of borough lands. Two of them preside yearly by rotation as head officers; and these two presiding capital bailiffs may, if they please, (at a court leet, held in <HI>October</HI> yearly) appoint substitutes to execute the menial offices of the borough, who are called sub-bailiffs. This borough discontinued sending members to parliament for many years; but was restored to its ancient privi|leges, 4 <HI>Charles</HI> I. Since which time, it has continued
<PB N="307" REF="013851_0337_0F9E2A6B10A71F60">
to send two members to every parliament, and the sheriff's precept for chusing members is always direct|ed to the bailiffs thereof. For several years after the borough was restored to its privileges, the two presiding capital bailiffs when present, or one of them when the other was absent, enjoyed the sole right of making the return to the sheriff's precept, that is to say, of returning the members they thought legally chosen. But since the restoration, these nine ancient parcels of borough lands having been all ingrossed, and become the property of two neighbouring gentlemen, by agree|ment between themselves, they, or some of their friends were generally chosen and returned without opposition; and as it often happened that neither of the capital presiding bailiffs were present, the return was often made by their substitutes, or sub-bailiffs: but some|times by the capital bailiff or bailiffs, and most frequently by the baliffs and burgesses of the said borough. This was the constitution of the said borough at the time of the last election, when <HI>Thomas Medlycott,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and <HI>William Bishop,</HI> were the presiding capital bailiffs, and one <HI>Arthur Ansty</HI> (said to be a common day-labourer and servant to the said <HI>Thomas Medlycott</HI>) was the sub-bailiff appointed by the said <HI>Medlycott.</HI> The candidates were <HI>Michael Harvey</HI> and <HI>Ieffry French,</HI> Esqrs. on one side, and the said <HI>Thomas Medlycott</HI> and <HI>Charles Church|ill,</HI> Esqrs. on the other; and when the election was over, a return of the too former was made to the sheriff by the said <HI>William Bishop,</HI> which he accepted and annexed to his precept; but some days after another return of the two latter was made to the sheriff by the said <HI>Arthur Ansty,</HI> which he likewise accepted, and an|nexed to his precept, so that his writ was returned with a double return for the said borough, and which was the legal return was the question, and the only question

that by order came to be determined on <HI>Thursday</HI> the 1st of <HI>December</HI> last. As to the return made by <HI>Wil|liam Bishop,</HI> it was objected, fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st, That the sub-bailiffs and not the capital bailiffs were by the custom of that borough th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> returning officers: and secondly, That the said <HI>William Bishop</HI> was not properly qualified to act, because he had not previously taken an oath of office. To th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> first objection it was answered, that by the custom of the borough the sub-bailiffs never acted but in the absence, or by the orders or permis|sion of their principals; and when either of the capi|tal bailiffs was present, neither of the sub-bailiffs could act as a principal; the capital bailiff present being then the sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> presiding officer. To the second objection it was answered, That <HI>William Bishop</HI> had taken all the oaths requisite by law, but that on oath of office was not r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quisite either by law or the custom of that bo|rough, as had been admitted by the said <HI>Thomas Medlycott</HI> himself. Then as to the return made by <HI>Arthur Ansty,</HI> it was objected, 1st, That as he was only a sub-bailiff, and both the capital presiding bailiffs not only present, but acting as presiding officers, he could not act as a presiding officer in any affair whatsoever; much less in such a principal one as that of returning members to parliament. And 2dly, That the return made by the said <HI>Arthur Ansty</HI> was void by virtue of a resolution of that house of the 2d of <HI>Iune,</HI> 1685, by which it was resolved, That no mayor, bailiff, or other officer, to whom the precept ought to be directed, is capable of being elected to serve in parliamenr for the same borough of which he is mayor, bailiff, or officer at the time of election. And as the return made by the said <HI>Arthur Ansty</HI> must be supposed to be a return made by the said <HI>Thomas Medlycott,</HI> whose substitute and servant he was, ac|cording
<PB N="309" REF="013851_0339_0F9E2A6FD39853B0">
to the axiom in law, <HI>qui facit per alium facit per se</HI>; therefore by this resolution it ought to be void. To the first objection it was answered, That by the custom of the borough the sub-bailiffs were the only proper returning officers, consequently the return made by <HI>Arthur Ansty</HI> was the only legal re|turn; and to the 2d it was answered, That if the axiom of law were to be applied to the election for this borough, neither of the two proprietors of the nine ancient parcels of borough lands could ever be chosen or returned as representatives for this borough, because both the capital and sub-bailiffs are but their deputies; and as this would be inconsistent with com|mon sense, as well as contrary to the custom of the borough, ever since the above-mentioned resolution, it could not be supposed, that the house thereby in|tended to render the sub-bailiffs of this borough inca|pable of returning either their immediate principals, the capital bailiffs, or their remote principals, the proprietors of these ancient parcels of borough lands. Upon the whole, the house, after having spent two days in hearing counsel, reading former returns, &amp;c. and examining witnesses, came to a resolution, that the execution of a precept for electing burgess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to serve in parliament for the borough of <HI>Milborn Port</HI> and the making of the return thereof, are only in the two sub-bailiffs of the said borough, or in one sub-bailiff, if there are not two, [<HI>one sub-bailiff</HI> is un|doubtedly more like to be <HI>bribed,</HI> than <HI>two capital bailiffs</HI>] in consequence of which the clerk of the crown, by order, took off the file the return made by <HI>William Bishop,</HI> and the said <HI>Thomas Medlycott</HI> and <HI>Charles Churchill,</HI> Esqrs. became thereby the only sitting Members<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB.

<P><PB N="310" REF="013851_0340_0F9E2A70EB427A68">The duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> in the year 1735, presented a petition to the lords from the dukes of <HI>Hamilton, Queensberry</HI> and <HI>Montrose,</HI> and the earls of <HI>Dundonald, Marchmont</HI> and <HI>Stair,</HI> complaining, That, at the election of the sixteen <HI>Scotch</HI> peers, several undue methods and illegal practices were used, of which they could bring proofs, and praying that the house of lords would allow them to be laid before them <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, IV.360.</NOTE>. The <HI>petitioners</HI> were persons of the highest rank and most respectable personal characters. The <HI>matter</HI> of their petition was of supreme consequence, affecting the very existence of the house of lords.</P>
<P>Some of the court-lords were against making any enquiry into the matter of it; fearing, that some things might come out, which would not be much for their honour. The earl of <HI>Chesterfield</HI> and lord <HI>Bathurst</HI> said, it was very extraordinary, that any hesi|tation should be made in the house of lords whether they should listen to a complaint of so high an enor|mity made by persons of such rank. When the matter came before the house, the dukes of <HI>Athol</HI> and <HI>Buccleugh</HI> observed, that the terms of the petition were vague and indefinite. It was remarked, that two <HI>Scotch</HI> peers speaking against the petition was rather indelicate. It was likewise observed, that the house of peers is not, like the courts below, confined to forms; but may proceed to the general issue and merits of the cause in the most natural way. It was moved, That the petitioning lords should be desired to declare, whether they intended to controvert the late election <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 366.</NOTE>. The petitioning lords declared, they did not intend to controvert the election or return of
<PB N="311" REF="013851_0341_0F9E2A71340FCA10">
the sixteen peers from <HI>Scotland,</HI> but only to lay before the house certain proceedings at the election, which they thought dangerous to the constitution, and which might affect future elections. A multitude of diffi|culties were started about such an enquiry's drawing imputations on certain characters; but it was rightly observed, that the lords would do well to consider, whether throwing impediments in the way of a due enquiry into the matter of the petition, would not draw imputations upon the house of peers.</P>
<P>The petitioning lords made a renewed application to the house of peers, signifying, besides what they had said in their first representation, that they could not, in the matter of their petition, act both as prosecutors and witnesses; that though their informations were sufficiently certain as to the fact, that there had been undue proceedings at the election of <HI>Scotch</HI> peers, yet their informers might not have thought proper to give in names, and may avoid doing so, till brought before the house of peers. Then they added <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, IV.395.</NOTE> as fol|lows;
<Q>Though the opening the particulars of the facts to be proved may necessarily produce such a discovery of evidence before examination as is usually thought dangerous even in course of ordinary trials, and may be much more so in the case of a parliamen|tary enquiry: Yet nevertheless, in consequence of your lordship's order, as far as we are able from the nature of the thing, we do humbly acquaint your lordship's, that we laid the petition before you upon information that the list of sixteen peers for <HI>Scotland</HI> had been framed by persons in high trust under the crown, long previous to the election itself; and
<PB N="312" REF="013851_0342_0F9E2A71D6BB1F50">
that this list was shewn to peers as a list approved of by the crown, and was called the king's list; from which there was to be no <HI>variation,</HI> unless it was to make way for one or two particular peers, on condition that they should <HI>go along</HI> with the <HI>measure.</HI> That peers were solicited to vote for the list, called the crown-list, without the liberty of making any alterations. That endeavours were used to engage peers to vote for this list by promise of <HI>pensions,</HI> and <HI>offices</HI> civil and military, to them|selves and near relations; and by actual promise and offers of sums of <HI>money.</HI> That sums of money were actually <HI>given</HI> to or for the use of some peers to engage them to concur in the voting for this list. That annual pensions were promised to be paid to peers, if they concurred in the voting for this list; some of them to be on a <HI>regular</HI> establishment, and others to be paid <HI>without</HI> any <HI>establishment</HI> at all. That about the time of this election, numbers of pensions, office (of which some were <HI>nominal</HI>) and <HI>releases</HI> of <HI>debts</HI> owing to the crown, were <HI>granted</HI> to peers, who concurred in voting for this list, and to their near <HI>relations.</HI> That on the day of election, a batta|lion of his maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sty's <HI>forces</HI> was drawn up in the Abbey court, at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and three companies of it were marched fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m <HI>Leith</HI> (a place at <HI>one</HI> mile's dis|tance) to join the rest of the battalion, and kept under arms from nine in the morning till nine at night, when the <HI>election</HI> was <HI>ended,</HI> contrary to custom at elections, and without any cause or occa|si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, that your petitioners could foresee, other than the overawing of the election.

<P>All this however, went for nothing with many of their good lordships. It was not sufficiently <HI>particu|lar</HI> to be taken notice of by the house.

The demurring lords were even so hard put to it, that they blamed the petitoning lords for not menti|oning the <HI>name</HI> of the <HI>officer,</HI> who commanded the regiment, which was appointed to overawe the elec|tion. But nothing would have been more trifling, than their naming him, because he was not guilty; but was obliged to obey his superior officer.</P>
<P><Q>If a coroner, my lords,</Q>
(says one of the right honourable speakers)
<Q>should be informed that a per|son had been murdered, the body buried, and the murderer concealed; but that if he would examine such witnesses as his informers should direct him to, the murder might be discovered, and the persons guilty apprehended and brought to condign punish|ment; surely the coroner would be very <HI>deficient</HI> in his duty if he should <HI>neglect</HI> or <HI>refuse enquiring</HI> into the affair, because his informers, could not, or per|haps would not, declare to him the persons guilty and the <HI>particular</HI> manner in which the murder was committed. Surely, my lords, if his informers were men of any character or credit, if they were
<PB N="314" REF="013851_0344_0F9E2A73545C2498">
persons upon whose information he could have the least dependence, he would immediately order the body to be taken up and examined, and would exa|mine, in the strictest manner, every witness hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> informers could direct him to. The case before us is the very same. If your lordships can have any dependence upon the character or credit of the peti|tioners, you must suspect that a most horrid murder has been committed. An election there has bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; whether it was a fair election, your lordships are to enqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; for if it was carried on by <HI>undue</HI> methods, and <HI>illegal</HI> practices, the <HI>right</HI> of the <HI>peer|age</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> has been <HI>murdered,</HI> our <HI>constitution</HI> has got, I am afraid, a mortal <HI>stab.</HI> I am per|suaded none of your lordships is of opinion that the petitioners are persons, whose information is not in <HI>the least</HI> to be depended on, and in such a case, upon such an information will your lordships refuse to make an enquiry, because they cannot inform you of the <HI>particular persons</HI> concerned in the <HI>murder,</HI> and of all the particular circumstances how it was committed? For God's sake, my lords, consider what an <HI>injury</HI> will be done, by such a <HI>refusal,</HI> to the <HI>nation</HI> in general; and what a public <HI>slur</HI> will be thrown upon the honour of this <HI>house,</HI> and upon the justice of our proceedings. In short, my lords, the honour of this house, as well as the independency of parliament, is, in my opinion, so much concerned in the affair now before us, the complaint is so well supported, the grievance so fully and so par|ticularly set forth, and a redress so loudly and so generally as well as particularly called for, that if we do not enquire strictly into this affair, I shall hardly expect that <HI>this house</HI> will <HI>ever</HI> for the future,
<PB N="315" REF="013851_0345_0F9E2A741C2863A8">
<HI>enquire</HI> into the <HI>complaints</HI> of any subject, or of <HI>any number</HI> of <HI>subjects</HI>; and if the other house follow the example of this, where then shall the subjects go to complain&punc; No where can they go, my lords, but to the foot of the <HI>throne,</HI> which they cannot approach, but when the ministers please to give them leave, and then, I am sure, it must be granted that the sub|jects of this once happy and free nation will be re|duced to the same state with those of the most abso|lute, the most <HI>slavish</HI> monarchy upon earth.</Q></P>
<P>The ministerial lords made a handle of the circum|stance, that the petitioning lords did not <HI>comply</HI> with their order, and send the <HI>names</HI> of the offenders. A gross proof of <HI>partiality</HI> against the <HI>matter</HI> of the peti|tion&punc; For the petitioning lords did not <HI>know</HI> all their names; and petitioned the house expresly for the purpose of <HI>finding out</HI> the guilty persons; which the petitioning lords <HI>themselves</HI> could not do. Besides that the naming, before examination, of the suspected persons was the sure way to defeat the examination by putting them upon absconding, or running away, and securing their <HI>betters</HI> from <HI>discovery.</HI> One would almost imagine, their tender hearted lordships meant this in pure compassion to the poor innocents, who had unthinkingly stabbed the liberties of their coun|try&punc; At any rate, there was one obvious advantage, of which the lords disappointed the nation, <HI>viz.</HI> The legislatures finding means for <HI>preventing</HI> (if they wished to prevent) such corrupt practices for the future.
<Q>We cannot conceive</Q>
(said the protesting lords)
<Q>that an innocent person, who should happen to be named in the course of such an examination, can possibly be deprived of the <HI>means</HI> of making his <HI>innocence</HI> appear. But we can well foresee, that
<PB N="316" REF="013851_0346_0F9E2A74DAC43410">
<HI>guilty</HI> persons (and these probably of the <HI>highest</HI> rank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; may <HI>escape</HI> by such a method; which imposing an <HI>impossibility</HI> on the informants, must, as we appre|hend, serve to defeat all parliamentary enquiries, and therefore could not be, in our opinion, within the intention of the order.</Q>
The protesting lords add,
<Q>We apprehend, that pinning down the peti|tioning lords to the precise <HI>words</HI> of the <HI>order,</HI> may be attended with this fatal consequence, that all <HI>parliamentary enquiries</HI> may be rendered much <HI>more difficult</HI> hereafter, which may probably give such en|couragement to corrupt <HI>ministers,</HI> that they may be prompted to make the most dangerous attempts upon the <HI>constitution,</HI> and hope to come off with <HI>impunity.</HI> Such apprehensions naturally suggest the melancholy reflection that our posterity may see the time when some of those lords who sit upon a more precarious foot than the rest of the house, having through mo|tives of virtue and honour, opposed the evil designs of some <HI>future</HI> minister, for that, and that <HI>alone,</HI> may be <HI>excluded</HI> at an ensuing election; and though the whole world may be sensible of the <HI>cause</HI> of their ex|clusion, no <HI>remedy</HI> may be found, but their case may become a subject of <HI>national</HI> concern, indignation, and resentment.</Q>
It was then moved, that the pe|tition should be dismissed. And it was urged (<HI>grave|ly</HI> I will not say; for I should think hardly even a court-lord could so effectually command his counte|nance) that it was <HI>a priori,</HI> and
<Q>from the nature of the thing,</Q>
improbable (<HI>geometrically demonstrable,</HI> they should have said)
<Q>that any such practices were made use of at the late election.</Q>
Because the elected lords, were <HI>good men</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, IV.413.</NOTE>. If this be not demonstration.
<PB N="317" REF="013851_0347_0F9E2A75AFF18F40">
let the reader judge. It was observed, on the part of the petition, that if such a petition was dismissed, it would naturally be concluded, That the house of peers
<Q>was never to enquire into any illegal prac|tices, if by such enquiry an impeachment, or any other parliamentary proceeding, might become ne|cessary for punishment.</Q>
It was said, That even
<Q>common fame, or a general clamour was not only a foundation for an enquiry, but such a foundation as the house of peers is obliged, both in honour and duty, to lay hold of;</Q>
that the guilty, if any such are found and convicted, may be brought to condign punishment; or, if otherwise, that the slanderers may be punished.
<Q>General <HI>clamours</HI> ought never to be <HI>contemned,</HI> the <HI>people</HI> ought to be <HI>satisfied.</HI> It is one of the chief <HI>ends</HI> of our <HI>meeting</HI> in this <HI>house,</HI> and in such cases there is no way of satisfying the people, but by a strict <HI>enquiry,</HI> and a severe <HI>punishment</HI> upon the <HI>guilty</HI>; for guilty persons there must necessarily be upon all such occasions, either on one side or the other.</Q>
And if a <HI>general clamour</HI> is a sufficient cause for parliamentary enquiry, how much more a petition from <HI>six noblemen</HI> formally complaining of <HI>injury</HI> done themselves and their <HI>country?</HI> To say nothing of the duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the <HI>first</HI> nobleman of the ancient kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI> or of any of the other four, who subscribed the petition, the venerable name of the earl of <HI>Stair</HI> was <HI>alone</HI> sufficient to sanctify what|ever it appeared affixed to, and to secure it from the neglect of any, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a set of men, who had long set shame and decency at defiance.</P>

<Q>But,</Q>
(say the lords on the side of the petition
<Q>was it ever before desired, or insisted on that the <HI>petitioners</HI> should give <HI>particular</HI> instances of the frauds or illegal practices they complained of?

<P>It was observed,
<Q>that even in private life, if a gen|tleman should relate a fact, and say he had it from such authority as he could depend on, it would not be consistent with common <HI>decency,</HI> to tell him, I can give <HI>no credit</HI> to what you relate; nay, I will not so much as be at the pains to <HI>enquire</HI> into the truth of it, unl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ss you give me your <HI>authority.</HI> Consider, my lords, what are the authorities that <HI>can</HI> be given. The noble lords the petitioners have told us, that they have

<HI>certain information</HI> of undue and illegal practices made use of towards engaging peers to vote for a list at the last election. The only authority they can give for this allegation is, that of the <HI>persons</HI> who <HI>told</HI> them so, and these are the very persons they desire to have <HI>examined</HI> at your <HI>lordships</HI> bar. Surely your lord|ships would not have them to give you that autho|rity at present; you would not have them now to give you the names of their informers; that would indeed be a discovery of evidence, the most open that ever was made, and more open than was ever desired from any plaintiff in this world. This therefore is <HI>not</HI> surely what the noble lords would have towards assisting them to form a judgment of their own in the present case; and yet <HI>if this be not what they want,</HI> I really cannot comprehend <HI>what</HI> they would have.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If we look back upon all former elections in par|liament, (says a nameless speaker in the debate) we must think it very strange that the sixteen peer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> chosen have always been of a <HI>ministerial</HI> complexion almost without exception; and if the complexion of any of them <HI>altered</HI> during the continuance of the parliament, we have always found them <HI>left out</HI> at the <HI>next</HI> election; nay, upon all <HI>changes</HI> of <HI>ministers,</HI> we have found the election of peers in <HI>Scotland</HI> take a <HI>new</HI> and a <HI>general</HI> turn. This could not, in my opinion, have happened without something of a very extraordinary ministerial <HI>influence</HI> on that election; and this extraordinary influence cannot be obtained without some <HI>undue</HI> methods and <HI>illegal</HI> practices; nay, it is natural to suppose, that if he is not a man of <HI>more</HI> virtue than ministers usually have, a minister will always make use of the power and the favours of the crown which are at his disposal, to get such a

set of peers returned from <HI>Scotland</HI> as he shall <HI>approve</HI> of; so that from the nature of the thing, as well as from past experience, we have all the reason in the world to believe there have been some illegal practices made use of at the <HI>last</HI> election; and as the honour of <HI>this house,</HI> as well as the preservation of the <HI>consti|tution,</HI> is deeply concerned in <HI>preventing</HI> such prac|tices, as such practices cannot be <HI>prevented</HI> by our <HI>ordinary</HI> courts of law, an enquiry into this affair i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> now, I think, become absolutely <HI>necessary.</HI></Q>
&mdash;
<Q><HI>Cus|tom,</HI> my lords, is of a mighty <HI>prevalent</HI> nature. Even <HI>virtue</HI> itself owes its <HI>respect</HI> in a great measure to custom; and <HI>vice,</HI> by being openly and <HI>avowed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y</HI> practised, soon comes to disguise itself, to conceal its deformity, and at length to assume the habit of virtue.

Corruption</HI> would then come to be openly and generally <HI>avowed</HI>; it would assume the habit of <HI>virtue</HI>; the sacrificing our <HI>country,</HI> the sacrificing of all the ties of <HI>honour, friend|ship,</HI> and <HI>blood,</HI> to any <HI>personal</HI> advantage or prefer|ment, would be called <HI>prudence</HI> and <HI>good sense,</HI> and every contra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y behaviour would be called <HI>madness</HI> and <HI>folly.</HI> Then indeed if there were a man of virtue left in the nation, he might have reason to cry out with the celebrated <HI>Roman</HI> patriot, O virtue I have followed thee as a real good; but now I find thou art nothing but an empty name. It was, my lords, the general corruption he found in his country that led that

great man into such an expression. He died in the de|fence of liberty and virtue; and with him expired the last remains of the liberty and virtue of his country; for <HI>virtue</HI> and <HI>liberty</HI> always go hand in hand; where|ever one is, there likewise is the other, and from every country they take their <HI>flight together.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It had been said on this occasion, that the enquiry proposed by the petitioners would put the nation in a ferment. To this it was replied <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, IV.422.</NOTE>,
<Q>As to the putting the nation in a <HI>ferment,</HI> I am sure in the present case our going upon an enquiry will put the nation into no ferment; but our refusing to make any enpuiry will certainly put the whole nation, and particularly <HI>Scotland,</HI> into a very great ferment. We ought to consider, my lords, the danger the whole nation was exposed to by a most unjust rebellion raised in that country against his late majesty; but if the <HI>peerage</HI> of that country should find themselves <HI>oppressed</HI> by a <HI>minister,</HI> and should find that <HI>no justice</HI> is to be expected from <HI>this house,</HI> it may raise <HI>another</HI> rebellion, or rather an <HI>insurrection,</HI> in that country; and as they would then have <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>justice</HI> on their side, it would naturally procure them the <HI>hearts</HI> of all the people of <HI>England,</HI> and I am afraid most of their <HI>hands.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The petition being dismissed, a protest was entered on the journals, in which are the following nervous passages, viz.</P>
<P><Q>When we consider the first particular in the answer of the lords petitioners, viz. That the list of sixteen peers for <HI>Scotland</HI> had been framed by persons in <HI>high</HI> trust under the crown, being <HI>previous</HI> to the election itself, and that the list was shewn to peers, as a list ap|proved
<PB N="322" REF="013851_0352_0F9E2A7951FBD608">
of by the <HI>crown,</HI> and was called the king's list; we are filled with <HI>indignation</HI> to see that <HI>great</HI> name <HI>indecently</HI> blended with the tricks of <HI>ministers,</HI> and profaned and <HI>prostituted</HI> to the <HI>worst</HI> purposes, to purposes that must necessarily tend to the <HI>subversion</HI> of our <HI>constitution,</HI> which we know it is his majesty's glory and desire to <HI>preserve.</HI> Such a criminal attempt to screen or facilitate a <HI>ministerial</HI> nomination by the interposition (equally false and illegal) of his ma|jesty's name, calls, in our opinion, not only for the strictest enquiry and the severest <HI>punishment</HI> upon the authors of the fact, if it be <HI>proved,</HI> or the <HI>assertors</HI> of it, if it be <HI>not</HI>; but it is in our opinion no way to be dropt <HI>unexamined</HI> and <HI>unenquired</HI> into; such a pre|cedent may in future times encourage the <HI>worst</HI> of <HI>ministers</HI> to load with his <HI>guilt</HI> the best of <HI>princes</HI>; the borrowed <HI>name</HI> of his <HI>sovereign</HI> may at once become his <HI>weapon</HI> and his <HI>shield,</HI> and the constitution may owe its danger, and he his defence to the abuse of his prince's <HI>name</HI> after a long abuse of his <HI>power.</HI></Q>
&mdash;We dissent, because we think the promises of pen|sions and offices, civil and military,' [and the other above-mentioned bribes offered to the peers, who should vote for the ministerial list]
<Q>seem in the highest degree to affect the honour and dignity of <HI>this house</HI>; since untroubled streams can hardly be expected to flow from a <HI>corrupted</HI> source: and if the election of sixteen peers for <HI>Scotland</HI> should ever by the foul arts of corruption dwindle into a <HI>ministerial</HI> nomination, instead of persons of the first <HI>rank,</HI> greatest <HI>merit,</HI> and most considerable property, we may expect in future parliaments, to see such only returned, who, owing their election to the nomination of the mini|ster, may purchase the continuance of their precarious seats by a fatal and unanimous submission to <HI>his</HI>

<PB N="324" REF="013851_0354_0F9E2A7AD0CE8D20">
of an <HI>election,</HI> they would not surely admit of a man's <HI>private</HI> confession to a neighbour in the country as an evidence against what he had sworn at the time of an <HI>election.</HI> Upon this the counsel on both sides were heard, and several journals read, particularly the resolution of that house of the 12th of <HI>February</HI> then last, in the case of the election for the borough of <HI>Southwark</HI> against admitting the petitioners counsel to examine <HI>Thomas Garman</HI> in <HI>contradiction</HI> to his oath at that <HI>election:</HI> And then the following question was proposed, <HI>viz.</HI> That the counsel for the pe|titioners be admitted to give evidence as to what a voter confessed, of his having <HI>no freehold,</HI> who, at the time of the <HI>election,</HI> swore <HI>he had.</HI> Upon this motion there was also a debate; but upon the question's being put, it was carried in the affirmative by 181 to 132.</Q></P>

<P><Q>I am surprised, to find gentlemen express so much impatience, as some begin to shew in this debate. I hope no gentleman comes here with a resolution to give his vote upon either side of any question, that may be started, till he has <HI>heard</HI> what may be said for or against it; and therefore in a question which so nearly concerns the liberties of this country, I can|not but be surprised at seeing gentlemen express an <HI>unwillingness</HI> to <HI>hear</HI> the <HI>argument</HI> fully <HI>discussed.</HI> If they will not be at the pains to let us hear <HI>their</HI> sen|timents upon it in any other way than by their <HI>Aye</HI> or <HI>No,</HI> they ought to <HI>attend particularly</HI> to those that <HI>will</HI>; for though these monosyllables may determine the question, I am sure neither of them will <HI>convince</HI> any reasonable man in the kingdom. The question now before us is not simply, Whether we shall agree to <HI>this clause</HI> or not. It is, Whether we shall agree to put an <HI>end</HI> to our <HI>constitution,</HI> and make <HI>slaves</HI> of ourselves, our constituents and posterity? For this, in my opinion, will be the certain consequence of our agreeing to this clause, however amended. That our liberties, nay and our properties too, depend upon the freedom of our <HI>elections,</HI> is a maxim which I be|lieve no man will contest. A corrupt parliament may for a time support an oppressive and wicked
<PB N="326" REF="013851_0356_0F9E2A7C58F8F990">
minister; but a parliament is but the stream: Our elections for parliament men are the fountain head, and as long as they are left free and uncorrupted, the stream will of course refine, and will at last become as pure as the fountain from whence it flows. But this clause, Sir, seems to be contrived for poisoning the fountain itself, and for rendering all the elections in the kingdom dependent upon the will of every fu|ture minister. Let us consider, Sir, that the free|dom of a man's vote at any election may be taken a|way, not only by an immediate <HI>bribe</HI> in ready money, or bank notes, but by the <HI>hopes</HI> of being rewarded for his compliances, or the <HI>fears</HI> of being made to suf|fer for his stubbornness; and if we consider how much a minister has it already in his power to make use of every one of those methods, we shall be ex|tremely cautious of making any new additions to that power. That our ministers have <HI>now</HI> a much greater command of ready <HI>money,</HI> than they <HI>formerly</HI> used to have, can be denied by no man who considers the late increase of the <HI>civil list</HI> revenue, the great sums of late years allowed, even in time of peace, for <HI>secret service</HI> money, and the savings that may be made out of the vast sums now granted for the <HI>current</HI> service. I believe, Sir, it will be as little contested, that our ministers have now a much <HI>greater</HI> number of lucrative posts and employments at their disposal, than any <HI>former</HI> ministers ever had in this kingdom. These, Sir, are a two edged sword in the hands of a minister; they serve not only for cultivating the <HI>hopes</HI> of the compliant, but for encreasing the <HI>fears</HI> of the stubborn at elections; and by our late practice they are now become more useful in both these respects than ever they were
<PB N="327" REF="013851_0357_0F9E2A7D317331E8">
before. It is now become a general and an esta|blished opinion, that no man is to expect or to hold any post or employment in the government&punc; unless he, and all those over whom he has any influence, take care to vote at every election according to the directions of the minister. What an effect this must have at all elections, gentlemen may easily imagine. If an elector has any thing mercenary in his temper, he will certainly vote according to court directions at every election, in hopes that he, his son, his brother, or some near relation, may get a post or a preferment in the service of the govern|ment; and it is a great hardship upon honest men, I mean those who vote upon all occasions accord|ing to conscience, to find themselves excluded from all the benefits that are to be reaped by serving their country in a public capacity. Whether it is so or not, I shall not pretend to say; but I am sure it is generally thought, that no man is now deemed capable to serve his country, unless he be ready upon all occasions to sacrifice the liberties of his country to the dictates of those who have the dis|posal of our public employments; and this of itself would in most countries be sufficient for establishing arbitrary power.</Q>
&mdash;He goes on afterwards as fol|lows.&mdash;
<Q>In a country where there is a multitude of <HI>penal</HI> laws, and especially when those laws not only punish, but <HI>create</HI> crimes, innocence can be no pro|tection against the malice or revenge of those who are entrusted with the executive part of the govern|ment. A man may <HI>without knowing</HI> it, be guilty of a breach of such <HI>intricate</HI> laws; and even when he is guilty of no breach, he may be plagued and harrassed out of his life, or at least out of his busi|ness,
<PB N="328" REF="013851_0358_0F9E2A7DCEE59D28">
by the governments officers. In such cir|cumstances he must not only be a very honest, but a very brave and resolute man, who will dare to vote at any election contrary to these menaces that are whispered to him by the tools of a minister&punc; and if we consider what numbers of electors are already brought into such circumstances by the many penal laws lately enacted, we shall have more reason to wonder at any elections being carried against the court interest, than at the <HI>minister</HI>'s having the <HI>direction</HI> of most of the <HI>elections</HI> in the kingdom. When our liberties are in so great danger, when there is so much reason to apprehend the prevalence of court influence upon every election in the king|dom, shall we pass a law, which will enable a minister to distress every man in the kingdom, who shall dare to disobey his orders at any election? I say, Sir, <HI>every man</HI> in the kingdom; for this law will enable a minister to distress not only our sea|men, but <HI>every man</HI> in the kingdom that has a house over his head. Such a law as this will have a most fatal effect upon the freedom of our elections, not only with regard to all such as are, or have ever been at sea, or in any business upon the water, but with regard to every other man in the kingdom, that happens to be a house-keeper. Quiet and security at home, is an advantage which every man must desire, and consequently being disturbed by unwelcome guests, or at unseasonable hours, is a danger every man must dread. By this law you are to put it in the power of a <HI>minister</HI> to disturb any <HI>house-keeper</HI> in the kingdom as <HI>often,</HI> and at such <HI>hours</HI> as <HI>he</HI> thinks fit; and consequently every house-keeper in the kingdom must be under a continual
<PB N="329" REF="013851_0359_0F9E2A816A2A0588">
terror of doing any thing that may provoke the minister to make use of this power against him. The interposition of an information upon <HI>oath,</HI> will be no restraint upon this power; because ministers are generally well provided with <HI>informers</HI> of all kinds, and the more wicked and oppressive a minister is, the more of these vermin he always has about him, and the more profligate they are. In my opinion it will be so far from diminishing, that it will <HI>increase</HI> the danger of this clause, because justices are to be not only empowered, but <HI>required</HI> to grant their warrant, and constables are <HI>obliged</HI> to execute the warrant of the justices. If you leave it as it stands at present, the execution of the law must be regulated, or at least it ought, I think, to be regulated by the present prac|tice in the case of vagrants. When the justices grant their warrant for a general search after vagrants and other idle and disorderly persons, the constables are not to search <HI>every</HI> house in the district; they are to search no where but in night houses, or houses of ill repute; and if they should disturb houses of good character, by virtue of such a warrant, they might be prosecuted, and would be punished; and therefore as this law now stands, the constables could, in my opinion, search no where but in houses reputed to be harbourers of absconding seamen. This, I say, is my opinion, but if the clause should be passed into a law, I shall not say that my opinion would be asked or followed; and therefore I do not think we should agree to a law, which by too extensive an interpretation might be made of the most dan|gerous consequence both to the liberties of our country, and to the property of every subject. But,
<PB N="330" REF="013851_0360_0F9E2A825F203360">
Sir, if you make the amendment proposed; if you <HI>require</HI> the justice to grant his warrant upon the oath of any informer, you will make the evil con|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quences of this law certain and unavoidable. The justice <HI>must</HI> then grant his warrant, and the house <HI>must</HI> be searched, let the character of the <HI>house</HI> be ever so <HI>good,</HI> let the character of the <HI>informer</HI> be ever so <HI>bad.</HI> This, Sir, is more than is done even in the case of <HI>felony</HI>; a justice is empowered to grant his warrant to search a house upon information on oath, that there is cause to suspect stolen goods being concealed in that house; but he is not <HI>required</HI> so to do. He may, and ought to refuse granting his warrant, if the informer be a mean person, or one of a bad character; and if, upon searching, no such goods be found, the <HI>informer</HI> would be made <HI>answerable</HI> for all damages sustained by such search. Nay the <HI>justice</HI> himself would be made answerable, if it should appear that he had granted his warrant upon the information of an insufficient person. I therefore wish, Sir, that the honourable gentlemen employed in drawing up this bill had considered a little better the constitution and the laws of their country; for from the bill, as it stands at present, the people without doors will be apt to imagine they have very little regard to the liberties, the proper|ties, or the ease of the subject, provided they can but increase the power and influence of the crown.</Q>
&mdash;Afterwards he adds what follows;&mdash;
<Q>Upon this subject, Sir, I cannot pass, unobserved, the late famous gin-act. By the established law of the land, before that act was passed or thought of, no person could sell beer, ale, or spiritous liquors, by retail, without a licence from the justices of peace. The
<PB N="331" REF="013851_0361_0F9E2A830FD7AA00">
justices had a power to <HI>refuse</HI> their licence, or to <HI>recall</HI> it, when they pleased; and if any one sold such liquors without a licence, he was by law made liable to severe penalties. Besides this, there were severe laws against all such as allowed drunkeness or tippling in their houses; and moreover there were several of our gin shops that might, I believe, have been indicted as a public nuisance. By a neglect of all these remedies, tippling and drunken|ness in gin-shops and ale-houses, came to a mon|strous height, and was generally complained of, and often presented by our grand inquest without any redress, because our <HI>justices</HI> of peace, who are entirely under the <HI>direction</HI> of our <HI>ministers,</HI> would not put the laws in execution against these enormi|ties. At last, when the people were worked up to a sufficient rage against these enormities we were told, that the laws in being were not sufficient for preventing them; and though every one that under|stood the law, knew the contrary, we were pre|vailed on to agree to a new law, by which a very great addition was made to the civil list revenue, and every vintner, inn-keeper, ale-house-keeper, vic|tualler, coffee-house, and brandy-shop in the king|dom, brought under a most slavish dependence upon our <HI>justices</HI> of the peace and <HI>commissioners</HI> of excise. That these were the effects of the gin-act must be apparent, Sir, to every one who considers that the great increase of the civil list revenue pretended to arise from its share of the duties upon spirituous liquors, was owing to the enormities complained of, which were, perhaps, for that very reason in|dulged; and for the same reason, perhaps, it was pretended, that no stop could be put to them by
<PB N="332" REF="013851_0362_0F9E2A840F01B0A8">
the laws in being, because if a stop had been put to them that way, the <HI>increase,</HI> which had arisen to the civil list revenue by indulging those enormities, would have been annihilated without any recompence from the aggregate fund. And if we consider the neces|sity every keeper of a public house is under of selling spirituous liquors in small quantities to his customers, the high penalties he is, by that act, subjected to, if he does so, and the <HI>power</HI> given to the <HI>commissioners</HI> of excise and <HI>justices</HI> of the peace, to mitigate those penalties; we may see, that the keeper of every pub|lic house must be under a slavish dependence upon our commissioners of excise and justices of the peace, and consequently that he must expect to be <HI>ruined,</HI> should he give his <HI>vote</HI> against a <HI>court</HI>-candidate. Thus we may see, Sir, that from all the inconveni|encies that arose either from a deficiency in our laws or from a neglect in the execution of them, an ad|vantage is taken for introducing some new regulation, by which the <HI>power</HI> and influence of the <HI>crown</HI> may be <HI>increased.</HI> This has so constantly, in all ages, been the practice of our ministers, that one may from thence conclude, that every man, as soon as he bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mes a <HI>minister,</HI> or as he calls himself, a servant of the crown, begins to think himself in duty bound to use eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y art he can think of for <HI>destroying</HI> the <HI>liber|ties</HI> of the subject. This, I say, seems to have been the way of thinking among ministers in all ages, and I am sure in no age more apparently than in this. Shall we then upon this, or any other oc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">asion, throw aside our jealousies and fears? Shall we put a trust in those, who by their practices have given us so good reason to be convinced of their
<PB N="333" REF="013851_0363_0F9E2A84AC714220">
having a design to betray us? If we are under any present inconvenience, if we are under present diffi|culties with regard to the <HI>manning</HI> of our <HI>fleet,</HI> let us examine whether they proceed from the neglect or misconduct of those concerned in the executive part of our government, or from any real defect in our constitution. If from the former, let us <HI>remove</HI> those who have run us into such difficulties; and if from the latter, let us consider our <HI>constitution,</HI> and apply those remedies that are most consistent with its secu|rity and preservation; but let us not plunge into the pit, which our enemies have dug for us on one hand, for fear of tumbling over the <HI>imaginary</HI> precipice which they frighten us with on the other. I am far from thinking we can be under any difficulty in man|ning all the ships we have occasion for in the present war; but suppose we were, there are many other re|medies, besides that now proposed.</Q>
&mdash;This remedy now under our consideration is the very worst that could be thought of. It is publishing our distress to the world, and giving our enemies a just caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to triumph over us. If the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Spaniards</HI> owed us a grudge, they could in no way so effectually punish us, as by forcing us to <HI>destroy</HI> our <HI>constitution,</HI> and <HI>give up</HI> our <HI>liberties,</HI> for the sake of defending ourselves against them.

<Q>We, the grand jury of and for the body of the county of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> do apprehend, that among the many enormities and offences committed against the public, none deserve our observation and censure more than those which tend to the subversion of the ancient rights of the people to a free election of their representatives in parliament, in whom they repose their undoubted share in the government as well as constitute them guardians of their liberties and properties.

The friends of the two former moved, that the matter of the petitions should be heard immediately; but those on the other insisted, that the merits of the return ought to be first heard and determined <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 153.</NOTE>; which was certainly reasonable. They therefore moved for the previous question, whether the question upon this motion should be now put. Because if the privious

But this the court party were against, and carried their point, that the matter of the petition should be heard on the 3d of <HI>December</HI> following.

It appeared, that the sheriff had given a very unfair advantage to the court gentlemen, by allowing them to make their objections to all the voters through the whole poll, before the opposition-gentlemen should object to one individual; of which it was impossible to go through half before the end of the month, when the writ was returnable <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 156.</NOTE>. The latter therefore insisted, that they were fairly elected, because they had an acknowleged majority, which could not be set aside by such an unfinished scrutiny, in which scrutiny, besides, they had not had an equal chance. It was therefore incumbent on the court-gentlemen's counsel to endeavour to overthrow the majority claimed by their antagonists. It was carried, that the opposi|tion-counsel should proceed to shew the general merits of their cause. They did so, and proposed to dis|qualify no less than 540 voters for the court-gentlemen. Then witnesses were examined for proving the par|tiality of the sheriff, and for
<Q>proving lord <HI>Parker</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Turner,</HI> and their agents, guilty of bribery; for which purpose, they likewise produced letters, which they proved to be the hand-writing of the said two gentlemen <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 157.</NOTE>.</Q>

<P>It is a common trick of our ministers to put a mul|titude of persons upon taking up their freedom in boroughs and cities before an election, with a view to their votes, every one of which may be supposed to be bought. Corporations have sometimes manfully re|fused to grant freedoms for such purposes; as that of <HI>Gloucester</HI> did about 1767. I took this fact from a Magazine, but have not quoted it rightly.</P>
<P>The number of petitions complaining of undue elections and returns was so great in the first sessions of the present parliament, that the house of commons must have employed one long session only in settling controverted elections, without bringing in any one bill, public or private. Therefore they thought it
<PB N="339" REF="013851_0369_0F9E2A890F560298">
necessary to put off all those petitions to next session. How many gentlemen may be supposed to have sat and voted during that session, who had no right to be there, and whose illegal votes did in fact render the acts made in that session null and void. See the Magazines, &amp;c. of the times.</P>
<P>Could a more solemn farce be acted, than that of a certain <HI>A. D.</HI> which shall be nameless, when the magi|strates of a certain famous city were gravely repri|manded by the speaker of the house of commons, because they had proposed to their then present mem|bers to re-elect them, if they would advance a sum, not to be sunk in <HI>private</HI> pockets, but toward relieving the <HI>city</HI> from some of its debts? How the speaker could help laughing in the midst of his speech, when he reflected, that at least two-thirds of the house had obtained their seats by <HI>more corrupt</HI> means, is not easy to understand. I should have been strongly tempted, had I been one of those reprimanded citizens, to answer his reprimand as follows:
<Q>None of your grimaces, pray good Mr. speaker. You have caught us, and you have pounded us, and there is an end of the matter. But look around you, and think what lungs you must have to reprimand all who have <HI>given</HI> and <HI>received money</HI> for <HI>seats</HI> and <HI>votes</HI> in this house.</Q></P>
<P>There is nothing new under the sun. There was a contested election between Mr. <HI>Trenchard</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bertie</HI> in <HI>Charles</HI> II's pensioned parliament.

<PB N="340" REF="013851_0370_0F9E2A89E0FE9050">
fairly voted 296 more than 1143. It is true, that Mr. <HI>Wilkes</HI> was known to have no <HI>real</HI> qualifi|cation. For there was at that very time a subscription carrying on, to enable him to pay his debts. And (to say nothing of any objections against that gentle|man's <HI>character</HI> rendering him unfit to be a legisla|tor) it was certainly not in character for persons as|suming to be the <HI>assertors</HI> of the <HI>constitution,</HI> to do so <HI>unconstitutional</HI> a thing, as promoting an <HI>unqualified</HI> person's election into parliament. At the same time, this does not justify the commons in their proceeding on that occasion; upon which I will add here, as a comment, the substance of a <HI>protest</HI> by several lords, as follows;</P>
<P>That the proceeding of the house of commons on that occasion was unconstitutional. That the house ought not to <HI>make</HI> law concerning elections; but on|ly to declare it as it is already made. That election is in the hands of the <HI>constituents,</HI> not of the <HI>house.</HI> That otherwise the house may come to be <HI>self-created,</HI> and the <HI>constituents</HI> thrown out of all <HI>power.</HI> That there is no precedent for making expulsion imply in|capacitation. <HI>Walpole</HI> was re-elected by the people, after he was expelled by the house, which shews the sense of the people to be, that expulsion does not in|capacitate; but only gives the people leave to re-elect the expelled person, if they please. That according to this way of proceeding, electors may hereafter be obliged to chuse only court-tools, or not chuse at all, if the house may expel and incapacitate arbitraily. That if the house have, in their own breast, the power of expulsion and incapacitation, they may, in corrupt times, expel and incapacitate every <HI>honest</HI> man. That the house of <HI>peers,</HI> though they ought not to <HI>interfere</HI> in the <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>exclusive</HI> business of the
<PB N="341" REF="013851_0371_0F9E2A8AAD65FE78">
<HI>other</HI> house, yet must interfere, when they see designs carrying on, for overturning the <HI>whole parliament.</HI> For the peers cannot make a parliament without a <HI>le|gal house of commons,</HI> any more than without a <HI>legal prince.</HI> That silence in such a case would be appro|bation. That the peers are trustees for the people, and must be faithful, else the people are left at the mercy of the house of commons, without relief from the other house. That the peers are the ancient con|stitutional counsellors of the crown, and must give the king good counsel, even against the house of commons, if that house acts wrong.

<P><Q>At this period it may be said the house of com|mons arrived at the height of despotism.

It is agreed, that every society has a right to determine on

its own members; but it must be a society of that nature, which by mutual agreement, <HI>constitutes it|self:</HI> but if such society derives its right from the de|putation of <HI>others,</HI> to determine the <HI>rights</HI> of their own <HI>members,</HI> would be to determine the right of the <HI>constituents,</HI> which no body of <HI>deputies</HI> can do; nor can a society framed by the inherent right of each in|dividual, be a judge of its own members: a bishop, for instance, or a lord of parliament, cannot have his right of voting in the house of peers taken away by a vote of the house of peers: a judge by a vote of the other judges, or a justice of peace by a vote of the bench of justices at a quarter sessions.&mdash;If the right of a member of any society is therefore inherent, or <HI>deputed,</HI> the <HI>society,</HI> of which he is a member, has <HI>no right</HI> to eject him from such society, for a longer time than till the opinion of those whose representa|tive he is, can judge whether the crime for which he is ejected is of that nature to disqualify him from such service <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB.

<P>In antient times, it is probable, that all the inhabi|tants of counties had privilege of voting for members (in those times almost any body might sit in parlia|ment in his own right) but this number was thought too unwieldy.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of Ministerial Influence in the House.</HEAD>
<P>TO endeavour to gain an undue influence over the members of the house of commons, is an old trick of our worst kings and ministers. It is true, they often carried things with a high hand, se|cure of what parliament should take well or ill. But violent measures are always dangerous, and it was un|certain how far the people's patience would bear. What was done under the umbrage of parliament had the appearance of just and constitutional government, and was likely to hold the longest. Our crafty states|men, therefore, chose to have parliament with them as much as they could.</P>
<P><Q>We think ourselves safe, says <HI>Nedham,</HI> because we have <HI>parliaments</HI>; but we do not consider, that we may be as effectually ruined by <HI>corrupt</HI> parliaments
<PB N="360" REF="013851_0390_0F9E2A9FC4222AA0">
as by ambitious tyrants. And corruption long estab|lished becomes a part of the <HI>constitution,</HI> and grows more and more <HI>difficult</HI> to eradicate. We understand our constitution to be in danger, not only when it <HI>is</HI> attacked, but as soon as a breach is made, by which it <HI>may</HI> be attacked; and we understand this danger to be greater or less in proportion to the breach that is made, and without any regard to the probability or improbability of an attack. This ex|planation of our meaning is the better founded, because the nation hath an undoubted right to pre|serve the constitution not only <HI>inviolate,</HI> but <HI>secure</HI> from violations <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DISSERT. ON PARTIES, 215.</NOTE></Q>.</P>
<P><Q>If (says <HI>Voltaire</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">ESS. SUR. l'HIST. II.187.</NOTE>) in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> the states had consisted only of nobles and clergy [with|out an assembly of deputies] the balance of <HI>Europe</HI> had not been in their hands in the year 1701.</Q>
And if the house of commons of <HI>England</HI> comes to be, through the influence of corruption, so enslaved to the court as to have no will of its own,&mdash;need I to add the consequence? If parliaments be good for any thing, independent parliaments are alone good for any thing. Suppose a parliament dependent on the court; and you make it a licensed tyranny, instead of a free govern|ment; a burden and an incumbrance, instead of an advantage. If elections into the house, and votes in it, are good for any thing, <HI>free</HI> elections and votes are <HI>alone</HI> good for any thing. In an <HI>influenced</HI> election, or <HI>dictated</HI> vote, the influencing minister is the nomi|nator of the member, and the <HI>sole</HI> legislator.</P>
<P>By 2 <HI>Geo.</HI> II. cap. 24. the last determination of the house of commons is to decide finally what votes shall
<PB N="361" REF="013851_0391_0F9E2AA05CA06268">
be legal in every city, or burgh. But a corrupt house of commons will naturally throw the votes into the hands of the corporation, rather than of the inhabi|tants at large, because it is easier to bribe a few than many, this power is therefore lodged in wrong hands, considering the character of our modern houses of commons.</P>
<P>If a resolution of the house of commons is thus to determine who has right of voting, surely the inde|pendency of the house of commons is a matter of infinite consequence. For a corrupt house may, by a resolution, reduce the 5700 voters, who now send in the majority of the members for <HI>England,</HI> to 1000. They may throw the power of sending the members into the hands of the king and council, and deprive the people of even the <HI>mockery</HI> of <HI>chusing</HI> representa|tives; which is all they have at present.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Parliamentaria comitia veteres,</HI> &amp;c. Parliament has power to repeal old laws, and to establish new; to make regulations for times present and future. Parliament can decide all matters of property; it can give legitimacy to the spurious; it establishes pub|lic worship; appoints weights and measures; deter|mines the succession to the crown; decides all con|troversies without appeal, where there is no law by which to judge; it lays on taxes; it pardons offen|ces; it supports the oppressed and punishes the oppres|sor; it has power of life and death; it has, in short, the power of doing whatever could be done by the <HI>comitia centuriata,</HI> or <HI>tribunitie,</HI> that is to say, by the whole people of <HI>Rome</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Thom.

<P><PB N="362" REF="013851_0392_0F9E2AA10F3595D0">The house of commons claims to itself, as we have seen above, many important and interesting privi|leges, and runs far into the executive, inflicting, in consequence, not of the known laws of the land, but of the undetermined <HI>lex et consuetudo parliamenti,</HI> various pains and penalties upon the subjects, its creators. It is therefore of great consequence to the people, that this irresistable assembly be as little as possible obnoxious to every evil byass and influence.</P>
<P>The sycophants, who surround our kings, tell them, all is well. Here is a parliament regularly assembled every year.

And with regard to the last&mdash;<HI>Hinc illae lachrymae</HI>&mdash;We have in these papers proof to demonstration, that from a certain period our parlia|ments have done what they should have left undone, and have left undone what they should have done: That to the calls of the crown they have always an|swered; That to the cries of the people they have been always deaf; That they have purchased on one hand only to sell on the other; That they have waved their privileges in compliment to the prerogative, and put them to the stretch, to oppress and subdue the subject; That instead of redressing grievances, they have authorized them; That instead of prose|cuting malefactors, they have screened them; and that instead of protecting and defending the rights of their constituents, they have perfidiously betrayed them.

already observed, 'tis more than probable we should not be trusted with the opportunity. By the same violence that one parliament, chosen but for three years, could prolong their own sitting for seven, any other may presume to render themselves perpetual. Experience shews us, that the writ of election to a borough, and the <HI>conge d'elire</HI> to a dean and chap|ter, already operate in pretty much the same man|ner; That those in power are always sure of finding or making a majority in both houses; That the dic|tates of the privy council, or first minister, are uniformly received by that majority as laws; That the grand secret of government is to fleece with one hand and corrupt with the other; and that the sole relic of the people's power, is the glorious privilege to sell themselves as often as they are favoured with leave to make a new election. So fatally true is the maxim of that great statesman <HI>Burleigh,</HI> that <HI>England</HI> can never be undone but by a parliament. In a word, so great is the influence of the crown become, so ser|vile the spirit of our grandees, and so depraved the hearts of the people, that hope itself begins to sicken; and those who are disposed to go farthest in the cause of the commonwealth, are on the point of crying out,

apprehend any such conspiracy against them, they have a right not only to put in their protest, but to renounce the deed, and refuse obedience: That in such a case, the delegation they had made would be dissolved: That consequently all authority would re|turn into the hands of those who gave it; and with one united voice they might call on the prerogative to do them justice by dismissing such unfaithful servants, and enabling them to make a new choice <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">USE AND ABUSE OF PARL.

Treason equally extends to those, who would subvert either house of parliament, or the rights and privileges of the people, as to those who attempt to destroy the person of the king, or dethrone him.

A wise and good prince will always agree with an incor|rupt parliament; and then the nation might see, with satisfaction, Sir <HI>Arnolds</HI> whimsical idea realized. But it is easy to imagine a condition of things, in which Athanasianism would be as little desirable in the state as in the church. I mean, supposing a weak, a wicked or a too ductile prince on the throne, a designing court, and a house of lords and commons attached to its villainous interests and views by places, pensions, bribes, contracts, lotteries, and promises.

<P><Q>Setting aside the dangers, foreign and domestic, that arise from profusion in what belongs to the public, it depraves all the different ranks of men; for, in profuse governments it has been ever observed, that the people from bad example have grown lazy and expensive; the court has become luxurious and mercenary; and the camp insolent and seditious. Where waste of the public treasure has obtained in a court, all good order is banished, because he who would promote it and be frugal for his prince, is looked upon as a com|mon enemy to all the rest. Virtue is neglected, which raises men by leisurely steps; whereas vice and flattery will, in a little time, under a ministry, who mind not what is given away, bring a man to a great estate; nor is industry cultivated where he does his business sufficiently, who knows which way to apply, and how to beg in a lucky and critical moment: And at such a season, many of the people's representatives

<Q>The marquis next proposed Mr. <HI>C&mdash;nw&mdash;y</HI> for secretary of state, and minister of the house of commons.</Q>
On which the note is, <Q>This officer is but of modern institution, and to the inexperienced reader may require some explanation.</Q> The first we find upon record is he, who in <HI>Nov.</HI> 1755, couched his first written instruc|tions in the following words:</P>

<P>The courtly gentlemen, like church-men, are wont to stave off all proposals for reformation, by alledging that the present is an improper time. And we have seen parliament too ready to come into the views of the court. But Mr. <HI>Sydenham</HI> shews in his speech, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1745, in the house of commons, that he thinks checking corruption is at all times seasonable, even though a rebellion were actually raging in the heart of the country.
<Q>Sir, I am surprised to hear gen|tlemen accused or suspected of a design to subvert the government on account of a motion calculated, in my opinion, better than any other to reconcile the minds of the people to our present establishment, and to induce them to join unanimously and heartily in any measures, that may be necessary, for defeat|ing the present rebellion. Whatever spirit may now appear among the people, we cannot forget, Sir, the spirit that appeared so generally amongst them, but a little while before, against corruption, and in favour of those bills that have already been several times offered to parliament for preventing it.</Q>
&mdash;And afterwards&mdash;
<Q>We are not to suppose, Sir, that
<PB N="382" REF="013851_0412_0F9E29E768010338">
the people have f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rgot their complaints, because they have not renewed them upon this occasion. They have so long complained in vain, and have lately been so much disappointed by those upon whom they chiefly relied, that I am afraid, their not renewing their instructions to their members, proceeds from their despair of ever meeting with redress from par|liament. But will this remove or diminish their discontent? On the contrary, we have more reason to dread their silence, than we ever had to dread their murmurs; for mankind resemble, in this, that animal which is their most faithful servant; while they bark they never bite. Have they ceased com|plaining? As they have yet received no satisfaction, we have, from the nature of mankind, just reason to presume, that they have begun to think of act|ing; and this, at such a dangerous conjuncture, we ought to prevent, by giving them, as soon as pos|sible, an assurance that they may expect redress from this session of parliament.</Q>
&mdash;Afterwards he goes on&mdash;<Q>The hon. gentleman says, he should be against the introducing of such bills while there is a rebel|lion raging in the kingdom, because he thinks, we may have an opportunity to get them passed after the rebellion is entirely extinguished. If I thought so, Sir, I should be very willing to have them de|ferred till the next session; but if we do not catch this opportunity, when some gentleman's personal safety may prevent their opposition, I am, both from reason and experience, convinced, we shall never be able, in a peaceable manner, to get any such bill passed into a law. The set of gentlemen I have mentioned, will always oppose such bills, because it is their interest not only to support, but
<PB N="383" REF="013851_0413_0F9E29E8A44124A8">
to propagate corruption; and from experience, I am convinced, that they will always have so much influence as to get a majority in this house for pre|venting any such bill's being brought in, or a majority in the other house for having it rejected. This I am the more convinced of, from what the hon. gen|tleman, and a worthy friend of his, have said against the amendment. There is a thing called proper or seasonable opportunity, that will always furnish a man with a pretence for opposing, when a minister, those bills and motions, which he patronized, when a country gentleman; and I have now several gentle|men in my eye, who, I believe, will always declare themselves zealous for preventing a corrupt influ|ence in parliament, or at elections, but will never, as long as they continue ministers, or the favourites of ministers, find a seasonable opportuntiy for bring|ing in an effectual bill for that purpose. Such gen|tlemen may perhaps consider the dangerous conse|quence of throwing out a popular bill at this juncture, therefore, tho' they know it will breed them a great deal of trouble hereafter, they may for their imme|diate safety, agree to its being passed into a law. If they and their friends agree to it, I will engage that no such bill shall occasion any division or alter|cation amongst us; and we may with the more free|dom embrace this opportunity, because such a bill can no way prevent or retard any thing the parlia|ment can do for defeating the rebellion.&mdash;</Q>After|wards he adds&mdash;
<Q>The people of <HI>Britain</HI> have been long grumbling: Give them satisfaction. Let them see they have something to fight for, I warrant you they will do it. But under an arbitrary govern|ment, whether established by force or corruption,
<PB N="384" REF="013851_0414_0F9E29E9571BAA28">
the people have neither liberty nor property; and in this age I doubt much if they will fight obsti|nately for their religion, even supposing they were all convinced of its being at stake. I therefore hope, Sir, that we shall in this sessions (come of the rebel|lion what will) pass some proper bills for preserving our constitution and liberties against corruption; and if we are resolved to pass any such bills in this session, we ought to intimate our resolution in our address upon this occasion, in order to encourage the people to stand by and support the present establishment in this time of imminent danger.</Q>
&mdash;Afterwards he adds&mdash;
<Q>Does not his majesty tell us that he has called us together, to give him our immediate advice as well as assistance with regard to the rebellion, still continuing in <HI>Scotland?</HI> Can we give him our advice in a more deliberate and authentic manner, than by framing and passing such bills as we think will best induce the people to assist him heartily? We cannot do this immediately, and therefore by way of answer to this part of his speech, we ought to tell him im|mediately, that is to say by our address, that we will do so. There is another part of his majesty's speech, Sir, which, in my opinion, will stand with|out any thing like an answer, if this amendment be not agreed to. His majesty tells us he questions not but the rebellion will end in procuring greater strength to that excellent constitution, which it was designed to subvert. In answer to this, is it not very proper to tell his majesty, that we shall take care in this session to frame such bills as, if passed into laws, will add strength to our excellent constitution. Is then any thing more proper or necessary for add|ing strength to our constitution, than that of pre|venting
<PB N="385" REF="013851_0415_0F9E29EA1A790210">
a corrupt influence in parliament or at elec|tions? This amendment is therefore not only a proper, but a necessary return to that part of his ma|jesty's speech: I say necessary, Sir, because I think it absolutely necessary for us, in a time of such danger, to take the first opportunity to assure the people of their having that grievance redressed, which they have long and loudly, but vainly hitherto, complained of; and because, without this amendment, not only our address will appear defective, but we shall appear deficient in our duty to our sovereign, for there will be, otherwise, not a word of answer to this material part of his majesty's speech, nor one word of advice, or any thing that looks like it, though his majesty has, in his speech, expressly told us, that for this very purpose he called us together sooner than he intended. And now to conclude, Sir, as the hon. gentleman was pleased to tell us what the world will think of those that insist upon this amendment, I shall beg leave to tell him, what in my opinion the world will think of those that oppose it. The world will, I am sure, generally approve of the amendment, and all will conclude, that if it had been agreed to, it would have done great and immediate service; there|fore, every man will say that the opposers of this a|mendment, notwithstanding their open pretences, are, in secret, friends to corruption; and that they have a greater regard to the interest and ease of those who are now, or may hereafter be, our ministers, than they have to the security of their sovereign, the happiness of their country, or the liberties of their countrymen <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB.

<P>Many ages have passed since the first tampering with parliaments. It is not easy to understand how a wicked court should be able to mis-lead a parliament with|out money, or other baits; but we have instances of it. In antient times our members of the house of commons were very ignorant, poor, and brought up by the priests with notions of slavish submission to their barons or to their kings. The commons, there|fore, too often consented to their own deception and enslaving. In more enlightened times our parlia|ments

have been fairly bribed with places, pensions, contracts, lotteries, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There was a villainous packed parliament under <HI>Rich.</HI> II. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1397. The king had changed all the sheriffs, and put in wretches attached to himself. All the public offices were put into the hands of his crea|tures. The king nominated the members for each place, and the placemen supported the king's nomina|tion. The parliament in 1386, had obtained the removal of the villainous favourites, the earls of <HI>Oxford, Suffolk,</HI> &amp;c. All the acts of that upright parliament were repealed, and every thing done to advance the prerogative above the laws. Many brave patriots were put to death, and the barbarous king chose to be present at some of these horrid scenes. They give up all their authority to twelve lords, and six commoners, the most devoted to the king's will.
<Q>This instance</Q>

<Q>shews that it is not impossibe but that the very parliament, which is designed to maintain the privileges of the nation, may throw it into slavery, when such assemblies are directed by popular factions,</Q>
[popular factions are always produced by <HI>ministerial</HI> oppression; the <HI>people</HI> of themselves are inclined to be <HI>quiet</HI>]
<Q>or the cabals of an ambitious prince, which, either by running the prerogative down too low,</Q>
[prerogative too low is hardly conceivable]
<Q>or screwing it up too high, has often produced disorder, and destroyed all law, instead of procuring the welfare of the kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>Enquiry was made, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1550, into the ma|nagement of public money. Few concerned (says <HI>Rapin</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">II.20.</NOTE>) but were found guilty of some misdemeanor.

<Q>So little skill, or so small means, had the court i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his reign for managing parliaments, that this house of commons shewed rather a stronger spirit of liber|ty than the former.</Q>
What a lesson does this sen|tence teach! In our times it is computed <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">see above, p. 269, <HI>et seq.</HI></NOTE> that the court has in its disposal several millions a year. If so, our court has great

<P>The militia bill passed the lords, <HI>A.

<Q>which seemed (say the collectors of the de|bates) to be giving up the constitution,</Q>
especially when it was declared unlawful to take arms against any person commissioned by the king. This was debated, but it was left in the oath, because, said those slavish peers and commoners, any person <HI>unlaw|fully</HI> commissioned, is not commissioned. Thus they left the liberties of <HI>England</HI> on the precarious founda|tion of a logical distinction.</P>
<P>The people in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> Ist's tyranny, petitioned for a parliament. We have seen the peo|ple, in the time of <HI>George</HI> III. petition for the disso|lution of parliament. In <HI>Charles</HI>'s time, the people's entire confidence was reposed in the parliament. The influence of the court in our house of commons has in great measure destroyed our dependence upon it.

and has of late times been applied to the buying off of a set of troublesome men, who would otherwise have opposed the pious designs of the court. That this is the truth, is demonstrable from the court's continuing the practice almost a century; which it certainly would not do, at such an enormous expence, if it did not find its account in the proceeding.</P>

<P>This mischievous invention has cruelly reduced the value of the revolution to the nation. Some of the worst evils of <HI>Stuart</HI>-government were the following, <HI>viz.</HI> 1.

Rais|ing ship-money and other taxes without consent of the representatives of the <HI>people.</HI> What avails the consent of a set of bribed representatives indemnified of the general burden by places and pensions? 3. Corrupting judges. Corrupting the house of com|mons is worse. It is poisoning the fountain-head. 4. Punishing arbitrarily, and according to no written law. But may not parliaments thoroughly enslaved to a court, be expected to make cruel <HI>laws,</HI> whenever the court happens to be of a cruel disposition. And
<PB N="401" REF="013851_0431_0F9E29FCD6777AE8">
what difference is it to the subject whether he is cruelly punished by <HI>Iefferies</HI>'s <HI>abuse</HI> of the laws, or by the direct injustice of the <HI>laws themselves,</HI> except, that the latter is putting him into a more <HI>unchangeably</HI> bad situation than the former. 5. Intimidating the mem|bers by fines, prisons, &amp;c. The evil of this practice consists only in its influencing the members to vote against their country. What difference does it make to the subjects, whether parliament is influenced to their prejudice by fear or by hope? When the <HI>Stuarts</HI> intimidated the members, that measure <HI>cost nothing</HI> to the nation. But we are obliged to <HI>pay</HI> for <HI>bribing</HI> them, to pay for the very rod, which is to beat our|selves. 6. Laying aside juries. We had better lay aside juries, than lay aside the whole efficiency, of par|liament. To bribe parliament is to lay aside its whole efficiency, and make it a mere limb of the court. Besides, a corrupt parliament may be expected to enact what our courtly lawyers, some of them of no mean rank, are often preaching up, <HI>viz.</HI> That juries are only to judge of the <HI>fact</HI>; the establishing of which doctrine by parliament, would produce precisely the same effect as abolishing juries by a statute. 7. Levy|ing war against parliament. A corrupt parliament is government armed against the people. 8. Seizing the 5 members. A corrupt parliament will seize and imprison all the incorrupt members, if they find it will answer their gracious ends. And a member had bet|ter be <HI>imprisoned</HI> by a ruffian tyrant, than persuaded by a fawning minister to <HI>damn</HI> himself and ruin his coun|try. 9. Dispensing with the laws, and making laws without consent of either lords or commons, that is, giving out proclamations, with the force of laws. But laws made, or laws repealed, by a set of profligate
<PB N="402" REF="013851_0432_0F9E29FD99C57150">
court-tools in St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s chapel, are as far from the sense of the independent <HI>people,</HI> as the <HI>Stuart</HI>'s procla|mations, or dispensations. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n fact, a corrupt court against an <HI>honest parliament</HI> and a brave people is no|thing near so formidable as a corrupt court and <HI>parlia|ment</HI> against a helpless people. The former case admits of a <HI>constitutional</HI> remedy; the latter leads to violence and contest between government and people. 10. But the <HI>Stuarts</HI> shut the exchequer. True. And our bribing ministers have, by doling about the money which should have paid the national debt, brought public credit to the very precipice of bankruptcy. 11. The <HI>Stuarts</HI> intended to establish absolute power in the prince. They did so. And our bribing courts intend to establish absolute power in a junto of gran|dees, who rule elections, and direct the members when to say Aye, and when No. 12. The <HI>Stuarts</HI> intended to re-establish popery; while our corruptors mean only atheism. Here I own a difference; popery being the worst thing in the universe, hell only ex|cepted. So that upon the whole, I know of scarce any evil we have escaped by the revolution, popery excepted, that is not in a fair way of being brought back upon us by corruption. The <HI>Stuarts</HI> were butch|ers. They attacked the good lady <HI>Britannia</HI> with slaughtering knives. Our genteeler corruptors have endeavoured her destruction by poison held out to her in a golden cup; or, as a humorous writer (I have forgot who) states it, between two thieves, whig and tory, the nation is crucified.</P>
<P>Suppose, in two suits of law, my first antagonist obliges the judge, by threatening his life, to give sentence against me, and my second bribes him. Am I not equally injured in both cases? The
<PB N="403" REF="013851_0433_0F9E29FEDF55D9C0">
<HI>Stuarts</HI> meant a tyranny by one; the <HI>Walpolians</HI> an aristocracy. Which is worst for <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P>The corruption introduced in king <HI>William</HI>'s time, on pretence of buying off the jacobites (doing a certain evil, that an uncertain good might come, overthrow|ing the <HI>virtue</HI> of the people&mdash;to <HI>save</HI> the nation) was so openly scandalous, that honest <HI>Burnet</HI> remonstrated to the king upon it, with almost as much severity as the old prophet used in reproving king <HI>David</HI> for mur|der and adultery. And good reason he had for using severity. A <HI>Dutchman</HI> comes over to <HI>Britain</HI> on pre|tence of delivering us from slavery; and makes it one of his first works to plunge us into the very vice which has enslaved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll the nations of the world, that have ever lost their liberties. When the parliament passed a bill for incapacitating certain persons, who might be supposed obvious to court influence, from sitting in parliament, our glorious deliverer refused the royal assent, which occasioned some severe resolu|tions against the advisers of that refusal, and a motion for a remonstrance to the king upon it.
<Q>When an enquiry was afterwards set on foot, into the venality of parliament, such a scene of iniquity was opened, as made the pension parliament of <HI>Charles</HI> II. seem innocent, and the court was then thought to have arrived at the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of corrup|tion <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">USE AND ABUSE OF PARL.

If king <HI>William</HI> had been as disinterested as he ought, and as he pretended, he would not have clo|setted members, nor promoted bribery. No man will dare damnation for the sake of doing good to <HI>others,</HI> unless he thinks to get, or keep, some advantage to

himself. May my soul stand upon a more secure foun|dation at the day of reckoning, than those of the best <HI>kings.</HI></P>
<P>Let the reader judge of this matter by the follow|ing extract from a writer of those times <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>A short state of our condition with relation to the present parliament, printed, A. D.</HI> 1693. ST. TRACTS, <HI>time of King William,</HI> II. 369.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q>200,000<HI>l.</HI> a year bestowed upon the parliament has already drawn out of the subjects pockets more millions than all our kings since the conquest have had from the nation.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>The king has about six score members, whom I can reckon, who are in places, and are thereby so entirely at his devotion, that though they have mortal feuds, when out of the house, though they are violently of opposite parties in their notions of government, yet they vote as lumpingly as the lawn sleeves, and never divide when the interest of the family, as they call it, is concern|ed, that is to say, when any court-project is on foot. The house is so officered, that by those who have places and pensions, together with their sons, bro|thers, and kinsmen, and those, who are fed with the hopes of preferment, and the too great influence, these have upon some honest mistaken country-gen|tleman, (I call them mistaken, who can be persuad|ed that an honest bill can at any time be out of sea|son) the king can baffle any bill, quash all grievances, stifle accounts, and ratify the articles of <HI>Limerick.</HI></Q>
&mdash;
<Q>I would trust an elected king a great way, if I saw he understood election to be his title; if our gener|osity would engage him to reformation. But when I see, he knows neither his own nor our interest, that
<PB N="405" REF="013851_0435_0F9E2A0030621008">
he hates and nicknames as commonwealths-men, those whose principles made them the authors of his greatness, and those that would have him do the bu|siness, for which he came, for which both he and we said he came; when I see him sometimes solicit|ing in person in the house of lords, and sometimes by lord <HI>Portland,</HI> besides what he does by his under-officers; when I hear, he sends commands to some lords, and bribes to others, and turns out of his place the gallant lord <HI>Bellamount,</HI> merely for giving his vote in the house of commons according to his conscience, thereby intending to terrify others; when I find the money, which the nation gives to defend our liberties from foreigners, is like to undermine them at home; in a word, when I see neither one house nor the other can withstand the power of gold; I say, when I perceive all this, I think it is time to look about us <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">ST. TRACTS, time of king <HI>William,</HI> II.369, 370.</NOTE>.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>I thought we had called him over to call ministers to an account, and to put it out of their power to abuse us hereafter unpunished. If any spirit of liberty remains, if we are not destined to destruction, sure the nation will take some way to let the king and both houses know, that they expect, they should not only provide for a campaign in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> but for our security even against our own victories, and such laws as may make it worth while to defend our country; I say, worth while to defend it; for if we are to be slaves, it is no matter to whom we are so.&mdash;Since members are retained by him with such overgrown fees (such places and perferments) to be council on his side; how can the people hope they

<P>Thus far this blunt honest writer. And it must be owned, that the constitution has long been only no|minally government by king, lords, and commons, but really a tyranny of ambitious and avaritious <HI>minis|ters,</HI> who have, in succession, enslaved and blinded their royal masters, wasted the public money, plunged the nation into inextricable debts and difficulties, mul|tiplied places and pensions, kept up large and expensive armies in time of peace, accumulated excises, misap|plied taxes, irritated our colonies, injured commerce, endangered public credit, debauched the virtue of the people, established corruption, as a necessary engine of government, over-ruled elections, defeated the very end of chusing representatives, by debauching the house of commons, the people's only <HI>Palladium</HI> against regal and ministerial tyranny, into a mere out-work of the court, by which means the sense of the nation has been, in innumerable instances, trampled
<PB N="407" REF="013851_0437_0F9E2A041FC4E770">
upon by the pretended representatives of the people, whose duty is, to follow it implicitly.</P>
<P>These are the triumphs of the whigs, our pretended delivers from the <HI>Stuarts</HI> of tyrannical memory, and from popery, and slavery.</P>
<P><Q>Nothing was done at the revolution (says the au|thor of DISSERT. ON PARTIES <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P. 220.</NOTE>) to prevent <HI>parlia|mentary</HI> corruption.</Q>Pleased that the open attacks on our constitution were defeated and prevented, men entertained no thought of the secret attacks that might be carried on against the independency of par|liaments, as if our dangers could be but of <HI>one</HI> kind, and could arise but from <HI>one</HI> family. Soon after the revolution, indeed, men of all sides and of all denominations (for it was not a <HI>party</HI>-cause, though there were who endeavoured to make it such) began to perceive, not only that nothing effectual had been done to hinder the undue influence of the crown in elections, and an over-ballance of the crea|tures of the court in parliament, but that the means of exercising such an influence at the will of the crown, were unawares and insensibly increased and every day increasing. In a word, they began to see that the foundations were laid of giving as great power to the crown indirectly, as the prerogative, they had formerly dreaded so much, could give direct|ly, and of establishing universal corruption. The first hath happened, and we pray that the last never may.</P>
<P>King <HI>William</HI>'s convention-parliament shewed an unpardonable negligence in taking no security against kingly encroachments, nor against parliamentary cor|ruption, nor for certain and annual redress of grie|vances,
<PB N="408" REF="013851_0438_0F9E2A0468087190">
nor for annual parliaments. They compli|mented him immediately (before they had any security that he would not abuse so enormous a trust, and with the greatest probability that the example would have bad effects) with the suspension of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> act, thereby laying at the feet of one individual the liberty of millions; which was never done in the much more dangerous times of queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> not in <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s rebellion by the tyrant <HI>Iames</HI> II. They declared the <HI>Irish</HI> rebels, for adhering to king <HI>Iames,</HI> when they were liable to be hanged, if they had resisted him, and before the revolution was known in <HI>Ireland.</HI> They humoured the <HI>Dutch</HI> demands, in complaisance to their new <HI>Dutch</HI> king, to the preju|dice of <HI>England.</HI> They entered blindfold, and rushed on to a length beyond all reason and prudence, into <HI>William</HI>'s views of humbling <HI>France</HI> by land-war, and first entangled us in those continental connexions, which have almost ruined us. Then parliament set|tled the king's revenue for life. Was that acting like wise men, who ought at least to have read their Bible, which would have told them, that there is no trust to be put in kings, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Then came the blessed contrivance of borrowing, and spending the principal, to the amount of 4 and 5 millions in one year, in continental wars, and loading the trade of the nation to pay the interest. Which admirable art we have since improved to such an height, as to raise the national debt to the frightful sum of 140 millions, by which our trade has been loaded with a burden of 5,600,000<HI>l. per ann.</HI></P>
<P>According to <HI>Davenant,</HI> there were granted to king <HI>William</HI> by parliament, chiefly for his continental
<PB N="409" REF="013851_0439_0F9E2A0513BAB860">
wars, in the years 1689, 90, and so on to 1698, no less than 48,000,000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Parliament overlooked in king <HI>William</HI> what they severely resented in his predecessor, the dispensing with the laws. King <HI>William,</HI> of his own authority, granted the <HI>Irish</HI> rebels conditions, which the laws refused them.</P>
<P>There was undoubtedly at the restoration, as well as at the revolution, a strong disposition both in parli|ament and people to humour the court. The nation was at these two periods just escaped from a tempes|tuous sea of intestine commotions, and getting into a calm harbour, was so overjoyed as to become almost wholly thoughtless of its danger in trusting kings and courts in so unlimited a manner. But a great part of these parliamentary concessions were the undoubted effect of direct gross bribery. It was thought, that the best part of 170,000 <HI>l.</HI> was given among the members of the house of commons by the <HI>East India</HI> company, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1695, to obtain a renewal of their exclusive charter, instead of opening the trade, which was much talked of at that time <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burn.</HI> HIST OWN TIMES, III.199.</NOTE>. Twelve lords and twenty-four commoners were a commit|tee appointed to search into the scenes of cor|ruption.</P>
<P><Q>Whenever (says LEGION <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Somers</HI>'s TRACTS, III.124.</NOTE>) a house of commons shall part with, expose, neglect, or suffer to be infringed, the liberties, rights, and peace of the peo|ple they represent</Q>
[and surely this they do, when they shew themselves the absolute slaves of the court by seconding the views of the ministry, right or

<Q>they betray their trust, they violate the ge|neral reason of their being chosen; their represent|ing power and being ceases of course, and they become, from that time forward, an unlawful assem|bly, and may and ought to be deposed and dismissed by the same laws of nature and right, by which oppressed subjects may, and in all ages have deposed tyrannical princes.&mdash;It cannot be just, that what our <HI>kings</HI> have no right to take away, our repres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tatives may give without law, or that the people should be obliged to endure the tyranny of 500 usurpers, more than of one, since no number nor quality of persons can make that lawful which in its own nature is not so.</Q>
They afterwards com|plain, that the town of <HI>Maidstone</HI> was deprived for two sessions of its privilege of sending two mem|bers. That at the elections for <HI>Westbury</HI> and <HI>Sudbury,</HI> the commons had given the seat to the candidate, who had 16 votes against 22. They complain of freeholders deprived of their right to chuse members; of partiality with respect to defaulters, punishing some and letting others escape; of resuming king <HI>William</HI>'s grants, while they allowed those of former kings, though much more infamous; of attempts to extend the prerogative only for the sake of embroil|ing the royal family with the peers. The commons were at that time disaffected, and the peers seem to have been of a better way of thinking; which is very extraordinary.</P>
<P>Sad scenes of corruption were found, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1694. Several contractors for cloathing the army were exa|mined. Refusing to satisfy the commons, they were committed to the Tower. A bill was ordered in for
<PB N="411" REF="013851_0441_0F9E2A097189E280">
punishing those, who should refuse to answer ques|tions asked by the house <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. II.448.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cornish</HI> was expelled the house of commons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1698, for acting as a commissioner of duties upon vellum, paper, parchment, &amp;c. while a mem|ber, contrary to 5 and 6 <HI>William</HI> III. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bohun</HI>'s RIGHT OF ELECT. 265.</NOTE></P>
<P>From discoveries made, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1695, it was sus|pected, that an universal corruption had overspread the nation, court, camp, city, and parliament. There was a deficiency of 294,798<HI>l.</HI> in the <HI>East India</HI> com|pany's stock, and some of the members were suspected of dabbling <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. II.451.</NOTE>. To wipe off suspicion, a committee of the commons was appointed to inspect the com|pany's books, and those of the chamberlain of <HI>Lon|don.</HI> It appears that several members were bribed, that the company might obtain a new charter. There were likewise corrupt practices among them for pro|curing the orphan's bill <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 454.</NOTE>. A resolution of the com|mons charged their speaker, <HI>Trevor,</HI> with corruption for receiving 1000 guineas from the city of <HI>London,</HI> after passing the orphan's bill <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 456.</NOTE>. He sends the mace to the house, and quits his post. <HI>Foley</HI> is chosen speaker in his room. Resolutions followed against several mem|bers, and a bill for obliging Sir <HI>Tho. Cooke</HI> to give an account of monies, which had passed through his hands. The bill was rejected by the lords, and <HI>Cooke</HI> suffered to escape, on promise, that he would make discoveries. He brings in a long and black list of those who had fingered the money, persons of noble

Sir <HI>Iosiah Child</HI> depos|ed, that the <HI>East India</HI> company had proposed to offer the king 50,000<HI>l.</HI> but that Mr. <HI>Tyssen</HI> had told them, from lord <HI>Portland,</HI> the king would have nothing to do with it <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<Q>Such actions as these</Q>
(a member said)
<Q>are a blemish, if not a scandal to the revolution itself.</Q>
Another member asked,
<Q>By what law it was a crime to take money at court?</Q>
It was answered,
<Q>If there was no such law, it was time there should be one <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 467.</NOTE>.</Q>
And it might have been added, That it is an article of the oath taken by all privy councellors, that they will avoid corruption <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blackst.</HI> COM. I.230.</NOTE>.
<Q>Justice is not to be sold,</Q>
said another member,
<Q>by common law.</Q>
[We should think that very un|common law in our times, by which a man obtained justice <HI>gratis,</HI> and our ministers publicly declare, they think it necessary, that the court have influence in parliament. Is not that selling justice?] Another member said,
<Q>There are parliaments to punish such crimes, and it is to be hoped, there will always be.</Q>
[Little did that honest gentleman think the time would come, when upwards of 200 notorious place|men and pensioners would sit in St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s chapel without a blush on their faces.]
<Q>Resolved, That

The duke of <HI>Leeds</HI> went to the house of commons, made a very weak speech, denied his receiving any money; but it appeared af|terwards, that this was a mere equivocation. The impeachment, however, was sent up to the lords. They acquaint the commons, That they had passed a bill for imprisoning Sir <HI>Tho. Cooke</HI> and others. The commons resolved,
<Q>That to offer money, or other advantage, to a member, for promoting any matter whatsoever depending in parliament, is a <HI>high</HI> crime and misdemeanour, tending to the subversion of the <HI>English</HI> constitution <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 470.</NOTE>.</Q>
[There ought, therefore, since that time, to reconcile principles with practice, to have been a resolution of the commons, that for a minister to offer, and actually to give money, and places to 200 members, for promoting his schemes, and to keep him in his place, is a <HI>low</HI> crime and mis|demeanour, <HI>not tending</HI> to the subversion of the <HI>Eng|lish</HI> constitution.] The commons were going on to impeach others; but were interrupted by Black Rod's calling them to attend the king, who was come to put an end to the sessions <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 471.</NOTE>. [Which shews a king to be a very convenient implement for the minister's purposes.] There were several other very reasonable bills before the house, which could not be carried through.

At your first meeting you found a method, without farther charge to my people, to ease them of the heavy load of more than nine millions; and the way of doing it may bring great advantage to the nation. In this session you have enabled me to be just in paying the debts due to my servants. And as you furnished supplies for carrying on the war, so you have strengthened my hands in obtaining a peace. Thus you have shewed yourselves the true representatives of my loyal commons, by the just regard you have paid to the good of your country and my honour: these proceedings will, I doubt not, preserve the memory of this parliament to posterity. My lords and gentle|men, At my coming to the crown, I found a war prepared for me. God has blessed my arms with many victories, and at last has enabled me to make

them useful by a safe and honourable peace. I heartily thank you for the assistance you have given me therein, and I promise myself, that, with your concurrence, it will be lasting. To this end, I recommend it to you all to make my subjects truly sensible what they gain by the peace, and that you will endeavour to dissipate those groundless jealousies which have been so industriously fomented amongst us, that our unhappy divisions may not weaken, and, in some sort, endanger the advantages I have obtained for my kingdoms. There are some (very few, I hope) who will never be satisfied with any govern|ment; it is necessary, therefore, that you shew your love to your country, by exerting yourselves to obviate the malice of the ill-minded, and to un|deceive the deluded. Nothing can establish peace at home, nothing can recover the disorders that have happened during so long a war, but a steady adhering to the constitution in church and state. Such as are true to these principles, are only to be relied on; and, as they have the best title to my favour, so you may depend upon my having no interest nor aim but your advantage, and the securing of our religion and liberty. I hope, for the quiet of these nations, and the universal good, that I shall next winter meet my parliament resolved to act upon the same principles, with the same prudence, and with such vigour, as may enable me to support the liberties of <HI>Europe</HI> abroad, and reduce the spirit of faction at home.</Q></P>
<P>It was proposed, to take the speech into con|sideration. Immediately the cry was given for an address of thanks, and no examination. They ac|cordingly acknowledge her great <HI>condescension</HI> in let|ting them know their <HI>own</HI> affair, which they had an

<P>The bill for the <HI>French</HI> trade was proposed, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1713, to be engrossed. The debates held from 3 till near II.

<P>By the treaty of <HI>Utrecht, Dunkirk</HI> was not to be demolished till an equivalent for it was put into the hands of the <HI>French.</HI> What that was to be, the court never explained. <HI>Cape Breton</HI> was left to <HI>France,</HI> with liberty of drying their fish on <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> All <HI>French</HI> goods were to come into <HI>England</HI> upon the same conditions as those of other countries, though they will hardly take any of ours in exchange, and though our <HI>Portuguese</HI> trade (one of the most advantageous we then had) and our silk, our linnen, and paper-manu|factures must have been ruined by admitting the <HI>French,</HI> and though it was found in former times, that our trade with <HI>France</HI> was a million a year loss to us. All trading people were alarmed. Yet a bill for making the treaty of commerce with <HI>France</HI> effectual was within 9 votes of being established by mini|sterial

This whole affair was carried on in the most bare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aced manner; nothing attempted to shew the advantage of a commerce with <HI>France,</HI> though so much to demonstrate, that it would prove ruinous to the nation <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burn.</HI> IV, 389-403.</NOTE>. Yet we have people among us, who cry, There is no fear that a parliament will pursue an interest contrary to that of the nation.</P>
<P>In the commons' address of thanks to the queen for that hopeful treaty, are the following.
<Q>Your majesty's extensive care hath not only provided for the security, but for the honour of your kingdoms.&mdash;The good foundation your majesty has laid for the interest of your people in trade, by what you have done in the treaty of navigation and commerce with <HI>France,</HI> gives us hopes of seeing it yet farther im|proved to the advantage of your kingdoms.</Q>

The queen thanks them for the address, which so fully expresses their approbation of the trea|ties of peace and commerce with <HI>France.</HI> It was with no small difficulty that so great advantages in trade, were obtained for my subjects.' This cure has cost me an infinite deal of trouble, says the mock-doctor. Was this parliament a representation of the people of <HI>England,</HI> which approved what the whole people shewed themselves so much against?</P>
<P>Both houses address the queen upon the safe, honour|able, and advantageous peace of <HI>Utrecht</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. V.127</NOTE>; by which <HI>England</HI> got just nothing but 50 millions debt. They thank her for

She answers, that she looks upon this address as the united voice of her affectionate and loyal subjects. It was the voice of jacobites only, and of a parliament enslaved to a jacobite ministry, and the ministry knew it was so. <HI>Burnet</HI> says, the lords never approved it. See his speech prepared to have been delivered in the house of peers, in case the ministry had moved for an act, or an address, ap|proving the peace, after it was published <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">HIST. OWN TIMES, IV.397.</NOTE>. The good bishop, like a faithful preacher of righteousness, in|veighs heavily against the perfidy of the court in patching up a peace without the consent and appro|bation of the allies, contrary to the express words of the treaties of alliance, upon which the war was, at the joint expence of the allies, entered into.
<Q>Swear|ing deceitfully, says he <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 399.</NOTE>, is one of the worst cha|racters; and he, who swears to his own hurt, and changes not, is amongst the best. It is a maxim of the wisest of kings, that the throne is established by righteousness. Treaties are of the nature of oaths, and when an oath is asked to confirm a treaty, it is never denied.</Q>
He goes on to shew,
<Q>that the popes were the first inventors of a dispensing power, by which they taught princes to break through oaths and treaties and mentions several shocking instances, very unfit for the imitation of a protestant court. He says, if any of the allies were deficient, there ought to have been demands and protestations, accord|ing to the usual forms in such cases; and that these being wanting, he cannot see, that the public faith, was not broken first on our side.</Q></P>

When afterwards it was thought proper to deprive the subjects of the beneficial trade to <HI>Spain</HI> by declaring war against that crown, and sending a fleet into the <HI>Mediterra|nean,</HI> to serve as ferry-boats for the emperor's troops, the good-natured commons approved these wise coun|sels <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P>It was found, that 40 lords and commoners were concerned in the <HI>S. S.</HI> scheme, and 300,000<HI>l.</HI> given in bribes to obtain an act of parliament allowing that company to erect itself into a bubble <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.
<Q>To sum up this whole affair in a few words (which would
<PB N="424" REF="013851_0454_0F9E2A16682EE938">
require a volume to detect and expose as it deserves) Though the mischief done by this infamous conspi|racy was visible to the whole world; and no skreen whatever was broad enough to cover the guilty from the knowledge and resentments of the public; the public vengeance fell only upon Mr. <HI>Aislabie</HI> (who was made the scape-goat of the ministry) upon the directors, and upon the estate of Mr. <HI>Craggs,</HI> sen. then in his grave, in the shape of expulsions, fines, and disqualifications. As the majority without doors had tasted of the calamity, there is but too much reason to fear the majority within either partook of the guilt, or were prevailed upon to join in com|pounding the felony: Not only court lords but court ladies had put in for a share of the spoil; nor could hardly any suspicion arise but what had some plausible circumstances to warrant it.</Q></P>

<P>It has been the constant labour of ministers to per|suade the people, that all those, who endeavour to detect their villainous schemes, are disaffected, or designing men, and that their views are not the pub|lic good; but their own advancement on the ruins of those, whom they strive to bring into disgrace with the public.</P>

<Q>From what has been proposed by the two hon. gentlemen, who made and seconded this motion,</Q>
[for an address of thanks and general approbation of all measures]
<Q>I should have concluded, if they had not told me otherwise, that they were acquainted with all the secrets of the cabinet, and had seen all the instructions sent to our ministers at foreign courts, as well as all the advices received from them; for without such a thorough knowledge, no man can, in my opinion, with honour agree to what they have proposed; and what gives me much more concern, I am afraid that such a thorough knowledge would be so far from warranting such a plumb approbation of all our foreign affairs, that it would furnish us with sufficient reasons for censuring every step that has been taken for some time past. As to the authority, which it is pretended we have from his majesty's speech from the throne, every gentleman knows, that in this house we are always to look upon that speech as the speech of the minister; and I have read of very few ministers whose asseverations, though given in the most religious, as well as solemn manner, I should depend upon with respect to any fact relating to their own conduct. Nor can I say that I have more dependence upon the testimony of our present ministers, than I could ever have upon that of any other. I must even be so free as to say, that what I have heard this day renders me a little more suspicious of their regard to truth, than I ever was heretofore. I confess I have as little acquaintance with the affairs of the cabinet as either of the honourable gentlemen, or, I believe, as any gentleman in the kingdom. I know nothing of our foreign affairs, but what I have from our public
<PB N="427" REF="013851_0457_0F9E2A1AA443B8D0">
gazettes, and these I know are often cooked up in order to deceive; but suppose they were not, and suppose we had from this news-paper-knowledge suf|ficient authority for believing every thing which by this motion we are to profess we believe, would this be an authority sufficient for this house to found any resolution upon? Is it not inconsistent with the dig|nity of this house and with the uniform practice of our ancestors to found our resolutions upon any thing but parliamentary knowledge <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. IV.177.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>He goes on to shew, that instead of general appro|bation of the measures pursued by the ministry, there was much room for censure; instead of congratula|tion, much cause for condolance. Our shipping seized by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> our colonies attacked by the <HI>French</HI>; the continent of <HI>Europe</HI> rather embroiled than quieted by our interposition in their quarrels; a disgraceful treaty with <HI>Spain</HI>; the peace of <HI>Aix-la-Chapelle</HI> dishonourable and precarious; the nation in|sulting <HI>England</HI> every where; settling the neutral islands in direct violation of the treaty; imprudent and unprofitable alliances on the continent of <HI>Europe,</HI> with subsidies of endless expence to <HI>Britain,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In <HI>Walpole</HI>'s, and all such dirty times, the constant endeavour of the opposition has been to get at facts, proceedings, extracts, papers, &amp;c. and the part of the ministerial crew, to negative all such motions. We accordingly find, in most sessions six or eight such motions quashed; every one of which was highly reasonable, many of them such, that the house was obliged to proceed in the dark for want of necessary papers, which the minister well knew to be very unfit
<PB N="428" REF="013851_0458_0F9E2A1BEEF57430">
for public inspection. Besides, it is a general rule with all men, who have indirect schemes in view, to conceal as many particulars as they can: for they are aware, that the knowledge of every particular fur|nishes their detectors with an advantage against them. He knew human nature well, who observed, that those whose deeds are evil, love darkness rather than light. But such statesmen give us authority to believe the very <HI>worst</HI> of their proceedings. They leave it to our imaginations to paint them as black as we please; and might as well let us know the worst; if it were not for the fear of impeachment, from which they are safe so long as they can. keep legal proof out of our reach, though they leave us no room to doubt of their guilt by their care to conceal their practices from us.</P>
<P>When Sir <HI>Geo. Byng</HI>'s instructions were called for by the opposition, <HI>A.D.</HI> 1721, and the question over|ruled by ministerial influence, several lords protested,
<Q>Because not finding any instance, on search of the journals, we believe there is none wherein a motion for admirals instructions to be laid before the house has been denied; but on the contrary, there are many precedents of instructions of a like nature, and in stronger cases, as we conceive&punc; addressed for by the house, and several in point for instructions given to admirals, particularly to Sir <HI>George Rooke,</HI> and Sir <HI>Cloudesly Shovel</HI>; nor does it seem to us at all material, whether the conduct of such admirals had or had not been blamed before such instructions were asked for, since the sight of instructions may be previously and absolutely necessary to inform the house whether their conduct be blameable or not. 2. Because we think it highly reasonable that these
<PB N="429" REF="013851_0459_0F9E2A1CC5080278">
instructions should be laid before this house, upon which the action of the <HI>British</HI> against the <HI>Spanish</HI> fleet in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> was founded, without any previous declaration of war, and even whilst a <HI>British</HI> minister, a secretary of state, was amicably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reating at <HI>Madrid,</HI> which court might justly con|clude itself secure from any hostile attack during the continuance of such negotiations. 3. Because till we have a sight of those instructions, and are able to judge of the reasons, on which they are founded; the war with <HI>Spain,</HI> in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat action of our fleet involved us, does not appear to us so justifiable as we could wish, and yet was plainly prejudicial to the nation in sundry respects; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it occasioned an entire interruption of our most valu|able commerce with <HI>Spain,</HI> at a time when <HI>Great Britain</HI> needed all the advantages of peace, to extri|cate itself from that heavy national debt it lay under; and as it deprived us of the friendship of <HI>Spain,</HI> not easily to be retrieved, so it gave our rivals in trade an opportunity to insinuate themselves into their affec|tions; and, we conceive, that to the war alone is owing the strict union there is at present between the crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> which it was the interest of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to have kept always divided, an union, which in its consequences may prove fatal to these kingdoms.

<P><Q><HI>Hor.

There was no necessity, he thought, for any enquiry how the nation came to be, for 20 years together, insulted by a state so much inferior in power as <HI>Spain</HI> is allowed to be. And he afterwards al|ledges [what every boy of 10 years of age could have confuted] that the enquiry into the conduct of the tory ministry in the end of queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s reign, was the cause of the rebellion in 1715. That therefore
<Q>all such enquiries must be allowed to be of dangerous consequence to the tranquillity of the nation</Q>

<P>Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> answered him well as follows;
<Q>I shall readily admit that the rights and privileges of parlia|ment have not of late years been so much disputed by our ministers as they were formerly, and if it were necessary I could give a very good reason for this complaisance on the part of our ministers; but the acknowledging of our right to enquire, will signify but little, if it should ever come to be in the power of ministers to prevail with a majority of this house to put a negative upon every question that tends to an enquiry. This, I hope, is not now our case: but I must observe, that for many years past either our ministers have been extremely good, or our parliaments extremely complaisant, for there has been no regular parliamentary enquiry into the conduct of any one minister, whilst he continued to be so; and if no minister's conduct is ever to be examined by parliament till after he is given up by the crown, I cannot think that parliamentary en|quiry will ever be of any great service to the nation. The hon. gentleman that spoke last has been so good as to acknowledge our right to enquire into the con|duct of public affairs; but if the arguments he has been pleased to make use of upon this occasion be al|lowed to be of any weight, I am sure no parliamentary enquiry into a minister's conduct can ever be set on

foot, because they will be of equal weight against every future enquiry, and every motion that may tend to enquiry.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Walpolians</HI> opposed all motions for enquiries into the conduct of the ministry during the negotiation with <HI>Spain,</HI> because such enquiries would occasion the producing of many papers, which would widen the breach, and make a war with <HI>Spain,</HI> unavoidable. And afterwards, when war was actually declared, and there was no longer any pretence on that account for opposing an enquiry&mdash;then the ministerial party opposed all parliamentary enquiry, because the con|sequence would be the publication of the government's plans for carrying on the war. The plain <HI>English</HI> of all which is, <Q>None of your enquiries.</Q></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Iohn Barnard</HI> argues on the same occasion ad|mirably as follows <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. XI.350.</NOTE>;
<Q>Sir, I have always attended my duty in this house, and always shall, as long as the people do me the honour of chusing me one of their representatives; but if we are never to enquire into the conduct of any minister, till that minister, or the crown, gives us leave to do so, our attending here, or our meeting together in this house, will be of very little signification to the people; for I may venture to prophesy that if ever we should have a house of commons so complaisant to the crown, as not to enquire into the conduct of ministers, with|out a <HI>cong&eacute;</HI> for that purpose, such a house of com|mons will, be as complaisant in every other respect, and will consequently agree to every law the crown may be pleased to propose, and to every grant the crown may be pleased to demand and insist on.
<PB N="433" REF="013851_0463_0F9E2A1F5278CE38">
Like some of the petty states in <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Germany,</HI> we may make humble remonstrances to our sove|reign, and represent our inability to comply with the free gift demanded of us; but when our sove|reign, or his prime minister, says it must be done, we may depend on it that such a house of commons will always submit and agree to what is demanded of them. The gentlemen of the other side of the question should be cautious of mentioning any thing that has been lately done in <HI>Spain:</HI> for there are many things now done in that kingdom which neither would or could be done if that country had pre|served their antient freedom and independency; and if the maxims these gentlemen have been pleased to advance upon this occasion should ever be received in this kingdom, our parliaments will soon become as complaisant to the crown, and of as little use to the people, as the cortez now are in <HI>Spain.</HI> A parli|amentary enquiry into a minister's conduct is, I find, very much mistaken by the gentlemen who oppose this question. Sir, it is not a trial: It is a sort of debt which every minister owes to the public. A minister is a sort of agent or steward for the public; and is not every steward obliged to give an account of his stewardship? When a lord happ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, upon the general view of his affairs, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> perfectly satis|fied with the management of his stewar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he may save himself the trouble of examining, or appointing others to examine, particularly into his steward's conduct and accounts; and in the same manner, when a nation happens, upon the general view of public affairs, to be perfectly well satisfied with the conduct of its ministers, there is no necessity for a particular enquiry into their conduct. But
<PB N="434" REF="013851_0464_0F9E2A2025BE27B8">
will any gentleman say this is our case at present? Sir, our conduct, as members of this house, is not in this case to be directed by our own opinion. This house is not the lord to whom our ministers are to answer for their conduct. The <HI>people</HI> are the lord, to whom they are to answer, and we are appointed by the people to examine into their con|duct and accounts. Therefore, when the people in general, or a great part of them, seem dissatisfied with the conduct of public affairs, it is our duty, whatever we ourselves may think, to make a strict and impartial enquiry into the conduct of our mini|sters, and to call for all papers that may be neces|sary for that purpose. This is not subjecting our ministers to a trial; it is only making them give an account to the people of their stewardship, which is an obligation they lay themselves under, when they accept of being the ministers of the crown, and consequently the stewards of the people; and they ought to be ready to perform the obligation when and as often as the people may please to require it. I am sorry it is not performed much oftener than has been usual of late years: I am sure the oftener it is performed, the more it will redound to the honour of a good administration, the better safe|guard it will be to the people against the frauds and oppressions of a bad one.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My lords, we must enquire</Q>
(says lord <HI>Carteret,</HI> in the debate on the add<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ess, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1740 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, VII.472.</NOTE>:)
<Q>The whole kingdom expects it at our hands. If we do not, there will be ugly insinuations made against the dignity and honour of this house both at home and abroad. For this very reason we ought to agree
<PB N="435" REF="013851_0465_0F9E2A2125DA6248">
to the noble duke's motion in order to satisfy the people as soon as possible, that in this session we will do our duty. It is a duty we owe to our sovereign as well as his people. If this proposition is refused, or set aside by the previous question, I shall look upon it as a refusal of any enquiry, and therefore, I must, in my own vindication, protest. In the glorious and successful administration that has been mentioned, though the ministers were willing, as all ministers are, to accept of all the panegyrics the parliament was willing to bestow, yet being conscious of their own innocence, they were too wise to oppose, or endeavour to evade an enquiry. There was then no mutual compact between a minister and his tools to protect one another against an impartial enquiry, and therefore in the year 1707, when a complaint was brought into this house against the admiralty, and an enquiry into the conduct of that board moved for, though prince <HI>George</HI> himself was then at the head of the admiralty, the ministers were so far from opposing, that they promoted an enquiry. A com|mittee was accordingly appointed, and a strict en|quiry carried on. Whereupon it was found that the prince's council had been guilty of great neglects with regard to the appointing of cruizers and con|voys for protecting our trade; for which, and for several other neglects and misdemeanours alledged against them, they were removed from that board, without so much as an attempt made by the mini|sters either to screen them from being found guilty, or to protect them after they were.</Q></P>
<P>A motion was made, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1741, after <HI>Walpole</HI> was out of power, for enquiry into the conduct of affairs last 20 years <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. XIII.140.</NOTE>. Lord <HI>Limerick,</HI> who made
<PB N="436" REF="013851_0466_0F9E2A219B0EE140">
the motion said,
<Q>It is justly suspected, that during the last twenty years, our ministers have taken most unjustifiable methods for gaining a corrupt influence, both at elections and in parliament. While our constitution subsists in all its force, it is certain, that the parliament, or at least this house of parliament, will always be of the same complexion with the ge|nerality of the people. It is from this house, his ma|jesty is to know the sentiments as well as the com|plaints of his people; therefore, when measures generally disliked by the people, meet with an appro|bation from this house, it may be justly suspected, that some illegal methods have been taken for obtain|ing that approbation; and if upon a new election a minister, who by his crimes or imprudence has ren|dered himself generally obnoxious to the people, should nevertheless get a majority of his friends, or rather creatures, returned as members of this house, we must suppose, that some illegal methods were taken for obtaining those returns.</Q></P>
<P>A motion being made, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1741, by Mr. <HI>Pul|teney,</HI> that the several papers presented to the house on <HI>Monday,</HI> and yesterday by Mr. Comptroller, be re|ferred to a select committee, and that they do exa|mine the same, and report to the house what they find material therein, it occasioned a great debate. Mr. <HI>Pulteney</HI> introduced his motion with the following speech. <Q>Mr. Speaker. I have always thought, that when papers of state are called for by this house, as well as when such papers are laid before us without being called for; it should be with some sort of view or design. We know very well, that when treaties, estimates, or accounts are laid before us, without being called for, it is generally with a design to
<PB N="437" REF="013851_0467_0F9E2A245C5576B8">
demand a sum of money, or vote of credit; and such demands have of late years been usually complied with, I believe, by most members of this house, without so much as looking at any one of the papers or estimates which were laid before us as the foundati|on of that demand. This practice, Sir, must be allow|ed to be a little extraordinary; but our late practice with regard to those papers that are expressly called for, has been much more surprizing; for after the papers called for have been laid before us, they have been ordered to lie upon the table, and there they have generally lain without the least examination, as if we had no view in calling for them, but that of encreasing the bulk of our votes by long lists of let|ters, instructions and memorials. Experience has shewn, that when such papers are ordered to lie upon the table for the perusal of the members, they are seldom perused with attention by any, and when they are perused separately and distinctly by a few particu|lar members, none of them have authority enough to prevail with the house to enter into a strict enquiry, or to take into consideration the errors, mistakes, or blunders, they may from such papers have discover|ed. For this reason, Sir, and that the nation may see we do not put the administration to the trouble and expence of laying piles of state-papers before us, without any view or design either for the service or satisfaction of the public, I think, when we call for any papers of importance, and they are accordingly laid before us, they ought of course to be referred to a select committee, that they may examine them strictly, and report their remarks, observations, or objections to the house; for the examination of such a committee must always be more exact and full, and their report
<PB N="438" REF="013851_0468_0F9E2A259C37C910">
will have more weight, than the examination or report of any single member who peruses the papers upon our table without any direction or authority from the house<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. XIII.70</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The multitude of commissioners and officers of the treasury, says lord <HI>Digby</HI> against <HI>Walpole</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 200.</NOTE>,
<Q>not|withstanding there being too great a number of both, can no way endanger the discovery of any misappli|cation of the public treasure, especially when the first commissioner has the direction of the secretary's office in the kingdom. The other commissioners, and the officers, either do not really know how the money issued by them is applied, or else they will never make a discovery, as long as they know that their first commissioner continues to be the chief favourite of the crown. This has been the touch-stone of such discoveries for many years past, and always will be so, till we have a parliament independent and resolute enough to pull a suspected minister even from behind the throne itself.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I am not at all surprized,</Q>
(says Mr. alderman <HI>Heathcote</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. II.268.</NOTE>)
<Q>to hear the prerogatives of the crown trumped up as a bar to any enquiry; for they have always been set up by ministers against every enquiry or prosecution that was ever proposed in parliament; but this can never be of any weight with those who can properly distinguish between the prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of parliament. The prerogatives of the crown, Sir, were all established by our constitution for the public good; and when they are properly made use of, the parliament hath
<PB N="439" REF="013851_0469_0F9E2A261CD4FB40">
nothing to do with them; but when they are made a wicked or an imprudent use of, the parliament hath then a right to interfere, and to punish those who advised the king to make such an use of the preroga|tive. Thus the king has by his prerogative the sole power of appointing all commanders both by sea and land, and while proper persons are employed, the parliament has no right to intermeddle; but when improper persons are appointed, and the public has suffered, or is like to suffer, the parliament has a right to interpose, and not only to remove the worth|less persons so appointed, but to punish those who advised the appointing of such. But, says the hon. gentleman, if we once begin to enquire into and punish those who advised the appointing of any gene|ral or admiral, we shall of course soon begin to assume to ourselves the power of appointing generals and admirals. I wish the hon. gentleman would re-consider this argument. If he does, he will find it to be in short thus. If we do what we have a right to do, we shall of course soon begin to do what we have no right to do. This may be logick among ministers of state; but I am sure it would not be allowed to pass for such among the under-graduates of any of our universities. By this method of ar|guing, Sir, we should put an end to one of the chief uses of parliaments, which is to take care that none of the prerogatives of the crown, which were all designed for the safety of the people, shall be ever turned towards their destruction; but however much this method of arguing may prevail among ministers of state, I hope it will never be admitted by this assembly. Here I hope the antient maxim of our constitution will always prevail, That the king has
<PB N="440" REF="013851_0470_0F9E2A26F4C2D9E8">

<L>Munere&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>VIRG.</BIBL></Q>
And to say the truth, Sir, the hon. gentleman and I have frequently before now intended to move a question of this sort, but we have as often expected it to come from more able gentlemen now in my eye, as one condition, <HI>sine qua non,</HI> of their change of situation. More than half of the session is lapsed, and not one of these conditions is fulfilled, Sir, almost all the money is given, not only all that the most believing and most sanguine country gentleman can raise, but all that the most devoted courtier can ask: but not a single grievance has been redressed. Should not these, Sir, and our supplies proceed <HI>pari passu?</HI> Let us therefore for shame make a beginning with this; and as it cannot be redressed but by en|quiry, let us now exercise one of our fundamental rights, which our infatuation, not corruption to be sure, has so long suspended, that it is almost lost. There is not a man in the nation, who does not know in his private capacity that there has been great mis|conduct,
<PB N="441" REF="013851_0471_0F9E2A27A1ACC9E0">
nay cowardice somewhere or other in the commanders of this <HI>English</HI> Armada. Should not then, Sir, even our ministers themselves have laid the whole before parliament? But which of us in his public capacity here has heard a word of it? Do none of our ministers recollect what was done when the duke of <HI>York</HI> commanded in the time of king <HI>Charles</HI> IId, and admiral <HI>Russel</HI> in that of king <HI>William?</HI> And these, Sir, were in some sort victories: for although in the former the <HI>Dutch</HI> burnt some of our ships at <HI>Chatham</HI>; yet before they got back, we sunk and destroyed twenty of their capital ships, though superior to us in num|ber; and although in the latter we destroyed sixteen of the <HI>French</HI> men of war, for which the admiral had the thanks of both houses, and was created earl of <HI>Torrington</HI>; yet, Sir, those princes were advised, unaddressed, to lay these matters upon your table, and I read in your journals, that censures were passed on particular parts of these transactions. But now, Sir, though more than a twelve month ago forty ships of <HI>England</HI> made with a difficulty a drawn battle against 30 of the combined fleets, yet the parliament is told nothing, nor has asked a single question concerning it. Therefore, for God's sake, Sir, for the sake of common sense, as well as justice and our own honour, let this enquiry be hastened. I shall, for the sake of form, trouble you with two subsequent motions, <HI>viz.</HI> That it may be a com|mittee of the whole house, and that this house do, this day fortnight resolve itself into a committee of the whole house upon this matter. Our journals justify the form and method of proceeding; and if any gentleman has objections to the thing, I hope I shall be permitted to enter the lists with him; for though on any other subject I should be soon van|quished,
<PB N="442" REF="013851_0472_0F9E2A287AB34478">
yet on this self-evident proposition I cannot but think of obtaining a complete victory <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. II.177.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Our chief business in this house,' says Mr. <HI>Care<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, A. D.</HI> 1745,
<Q>is to keep a watchful eye over those, who, under our sovereign, are the first springs of our government, and to make an enquiry into their con|duct, as often as we find the least reason to suspect that they have been prompted by some private view, to do or advise any thing that was inconsistent or of dangerous consequence to the public welfare. This, I say, is our chief business: this is our duty; and this duty we are the more obliged to perform when it appears that our country has suffered, or is like to suffer severely, by the misconduct or the bad advice given by our ministers <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 258.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It is owing to the same fatal influence in the parlia|ment of a neighbouring kingdom, that my much-honoured friend Sir <HI>W.

<P><HI>A. D.</HI> 1734, a message was brought to the commons from the king, desiring that the house would enable him to augment his army [against the windmills on the continent] if necessary, between the dissolution of that parliament and the sitting of a new one.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Wyndham</HI> spoke on this occasion as follows:
<Q>Sir, I must own my surprize is as great as my worthy friend's, that a message of this nature should be sent to this house so near to the close of
<PB N="443" REF="013851_0473_0F9E2A29164EF3E8">
this session; for whatever promises were or were not made the first day of the session, I am very sure most gentlemen expected that every thing of consequence had been over long before this time; and upon this general presumption, a great many gentlemen who have not the honour to be let into ministerial secrets, are gone into the country; it being at present more necessary perhaps than usual for such gentlemen to return to their respective countries, in order to prevent their being bought and jobbed out of that natural interest by which only they can expect to enjoy the honour of representing their country in parliament. But however necessary perhaps their presence may be at this time, yet if time be allowed them, I doubt not but most of them will think it their duty to return to the service of their country in this house when they hear that a matter of so very great importance is to come before us; it is I think, Sir, a matter of the highest importance; it is as my worthy friend called it an absolute surrender of our all, a surrender of the rights, and a delegating the power of parliament to the crown. This absolute power, it is true, is now demanded but till next session of parliament: but if it were not for the con|fidence I repose in his present majesty, I should be much afraid the next session would never be allowed to meet unless upon the new election a majority of the members should appear to be such as would be ready to confirm or to renew that surrender. The honour|able gentleman on the floor has told us, that it has always been usual to shew so much respect to the crown, as to take such messages as the present into our consideration the very next day, and that he remembers no instance to the contrary. It is true,
<PB N="444" REF="013851_0474_0F9E2A29D5B5A9B8">
Sir, since I have sat in parliament I remember many, but too many, messages something of this nature; and I believe they have always been taken into con|sideration the next day; but that did not proceed so much from the respect we owe to the crown, as from the cause of sending the message. There never was a message of this kind sent from the crown but when the nation was threatened with some such thing as an immediate invasion or insurrection, which in the body of the message was expressed to be the reason or cause of sending such a message, and as in such cases the near approach of the danger required the immediate concerting of proper measures to prevent it, we may suppose this was the chief reason of their being so immediately taken into consideration by this house. But as we are generally apt to improve upon bad precedents, I will be bold to say, that there never was such a message sent to parliament as the present, either with respect to its nature, to the reason of send|ing it, or to the time of its being sent. By no mes|sage that ever was sent to parliament, was there an absolute and unlimited power demanded by the crown, which, to every gentleman, must appear at first sight to be the demand now made upon us; there was never such a message sent to parliament, but what in|formed us of some immediate danger impending and just ready to fall upon the nation. By the present message we are told of no such thing; nor do I be|lieve that any such thing can be pretended; and I re|member no instance of a message any way resembling this, that ever was sent to this house, the very end of a session, and that session the last of a parliament. I cannot indeed, Sir, form to myself a reason why
<PB N="445" REF="013851_0475_0F9E2A2AEB4F72B8">
any such message should have been at all sent; and much less can I form a reason why it should have been sent at such a remarkable time; therefore, I must think that gentlemen will certainly expect to be informed by those who are able to inform them, what necessity there was for this message, and from what sudden and, till now, unforeseen change in our affairs, the sending of such a message has now become more necessary than it was at any time during the former part of the session,</Q>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>Many other members spoke unanswerably on the impropriety of such a message at such a time. But the ministry carried their point <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. VIII.212.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When it was determined, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1736, that, to save the destruction of the people by spirituous li|quors, certain burdens should be laid upon them, to enhance their price, and put them out of the reach of the vulgar; the <HI>Walpolian</HI> crew, ever attentive to money-matters, ever thirsting for the people's life-blood, insisted, that 70,000<HI>l.</HI> a year should be settled on the civil list, to make up for the deficiency, which would ensue, they said, upon the discouragement of spirituous liquors. It was urged, that the restraint laid on the use of spirituous liquors would improve all the revenues, and the civil list among the rest, be|cause it would save the lives of multitudes, and there would be a greater consumption of beer, &amp;c. and that, at most, parliament was only obliged to make good 43,000<HI>l.</HI> the sum, which the duties on spirituous liquors were expected to raise, the 70,000<HI>l.</HI> being a consequence of the people's excess. But the courtiers insisted, that parliament had no business to enquire
<PB N="446" REF="013851_0476_0F9E2A2B5A9C4180">
whether the duties granted to the civil list, produced the expected sum of 800,000<HI>l.</HI> a year, or a million; but if they did really produce more, that surplus was a sort of prize already granted to his majesty' [that is, to the ministry]
<Q>and parliament neither ought, nor could take any part of that surplus from him, or make any alteration,</Q>
[however necessary for the safety of the people]
<Q>by which that surplus might be diminished, without making good the loss in some other way <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB, COM. IX, 185.</NOTE>.</Q>
Thus these modest gentlemen argued, that the ministry ought to have certain revenues whole, that they might always have enough to dole away among their crew, whether those revenues pro|duced a million, or two millions, annually, and that the poor people are never to be gainers by any im|provement made in revenue-matters. All the while, they shewed no anxiety, whether the sinking fund might lose. No matter what becomes of the public. This is the manner of construing, at court, the old maxim, <HI>Salus populi suprema lex.</HI> It was carried, however, for the 70,000<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A. D.</HI> 1738, the house goes up with an address of thanks for the convention, which was so unpopular, they were ashamed to print it, in the votes, as usual. What a state of corruption the house must have been in <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. X, 6.</NOTE>!</P>

<P><Q>It is a maxim, Sir,</Q>
(says Sir <HI>W. Wyndham</HI> in the debate, <HI>A.

Some former parliaments seemed to speak, upon all occasions, the sense of ministers, and their sense only. But I am sure the character now generally given to those parliaments can be no en|couragement for us to follow their example <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. X.253.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The house of commons had for many years scarce any other employment than receiving addres|ses and petitions concerning the <HI>Spanish</HI> depreda|tions.&mdash;<Q>The arts and influence of the minister would have continued to defeat the voice of the nation and all the independent part of the parliament that called for war, had not the court of <HI>Spain</HI>&mdash;baffled all the complying arts made use of by the <HI>British</HI> minister, who would still have put off the war, had the court of <HI>Madrid</HI> condescended even to save common ap|pearances by seeming disposed to grant satisfaction to the <HI>British</HI> nation. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">MOD.

to lose his head for opposing the sense of the nation, though the sense of the nation had been wrong.</P>
<P>The duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> observed, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1739, in the debate on the pension-bill, that it was a little extra|ordinary, that the commons should pass the pension-bill, and very soon after reject a place-bill <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. VI.398.</NOTE>. There is no doubt, but the principle of a place-bill is the same with that of a pension-bill; and that there could be no reason given for passing one, that was not equally good for passing the other. But this proceed|ing of the commons may be explained by supposing, that, when the place-bill was five times passed by the commons, and thrown out by the lords, there was an understanding between the houses, and the com|mons passed upon the certainty that the lords would reject; and that when the commons rejected, they had not settled matters with the other house. Other|wise we must look upon them as a set of drivellers acting upon no principle whatever.</P>
<P><Q>Of late years, (says Mr. <HI>Pulteney</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. VII.286.</NOTE>) gentlemen have been led, I do not know how, into a new me|thod of proceeding in parliament, a method very dif|ferent from what our ancestors did always observe. In former times the general or particular grievances were first examined, considered and redressed in par|liament before they entered upon the granting of any supplies; but lately we have been led into a method of granting all the money necessary for the public service among the first things we do. The malt tax bill, the land tax bill, and such bills are now in every session the first things that appear upon the journals of this house; and when these things are finished, the gentlemen in the administration
<PB N="449" REF="013851_0479_0F9E2A30271E09C0">
generally look on the whole business of the session to be over. If this house should then enter upon any disagreeable enquiries into grievances, we might perhaps be told, that the season was too far spent; that it was necessary for gentlemen to return home to mind their private affairs; we might probably be obliged to defer to another session what the welfare of this nation required to be determined in the present. I hope gentlemen will consider this, and that they will again begin to follow the wise method observed by our ancestors, and keep some security in our own hands for our sitting till we have heard and redressed all the grievances of our fellow subjects.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whatever we may think, my lords, here at home,</Q>
says lord <HI>Carteret, A. D.</HI> 1739,
<Q>I have good reason to believe that the frequency of such demands</Q>
[votes of credit, civil list debts, &amp;c.]
<Q>and the ready com|pliance they have all met with, renders our consti|tution the common jest of every man abroad. Our pretences to liberty will, I fear, in a short time, be+come as much the ridicule of foreigners as our late conduct has already rendered our pretences to the holding of the balance of power in <HI>Europe.</HI> I was confirmed in this opinion by a question lately put to me by a <HI>French</HI> nobleman. He was a man of good sense, and yet he one day seriously asked me what difference there was between the parliament of <HI>Eng|land</HI> and the parliaments they have in <HI>France.</HI> I readily answered, and I hope I had some ground for saying, that in <HI>France</HI> the king makes their laws or edicts, and their parliaments must comply with what|ever the king desires, but in <HI>England</HI> our laws are made by king and parliament, and our parliaments may refuse to comply with whatever the king desires.
<PB N="450" REF="013851_0480_0F9E2A309AD677D8">
To which he as readily replied; In your late history we read of several extraordinary messages or demands sent by your king to his parliament, no one of which was ever refused; and pray where is the difference between an edict made by the king, and an edict made by king and parliament, if the parliament never refuses what the king is pleased to demand; for our parliaments claim the privilege of refusing as well as yours; and if a trial were to be made, such a refusal might perhaps be found as insignificant in <HI>England</HI> as it now appears to be in <HI>France.</HI> This I am apt to believe, my lords, is the way of thinking in other countries as well as <HI>France</HI>; and if a gene|ral vote of credit and confidence should once become a sort of customary compliment from the parliament to the crown, at the end of every session, or as often as our ministers may think fit to desire it, this may become the way of thinking at home, as well as a|broad. If this should ever come to be the case, our parliaments will of course become despicable in the eyes of most of our own people; and when the form of an act of parliament begins to be contemned, a proclamation may easily and safely be substituted in its stead. It would indeed be happy for the nation it were so, for when a parliament ceases to be a check upon ministers, it becomes an useless and unnecessary burden upon the people. The representatives of the people in parliament must always be paid some way or other by the people: If their wages are not paid openly and fairly by their respective constituents, as they were formerly, a majority of them may, in future times, be always ready to accept of wages from the administration, which must at last come out of the
<PB N="451" REF="013851_0481_0F9E2A3156052D30">
pockets of the people, and will fall with a much greater weight upon them; at the same time that it renders their representatives of no use to them. There is no way of preventing this, but by putting it out of the power of ministers to pay wages either to the elec|tors or elected; and this can be no way done, but by strictly confining public grants to public services, according to the estimates previously delivered into parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In all cases</Q>
(says Mr. <HI>Sandys</HI> in the debate on the <HI>Spanish</HI> depreciations, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1739 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. II.108.</NOTE>)
<Q>we ought to distinguish carefully between the respect due to the crown and the regard that may be claimed by the ministers of the crown. To the crown we owe a great and a sincere regard; but to ministers none, but what they justly acquire by their conduct. Nay, a regard for the latter may often be incon|sistent with that regard which is due to the former. Of late years parliaments have shewn a much greater respect to the ministers of the crown, than was usual in former ages; and I am under some appre|hensions that by continuing to shew the same respect for a few years longer, we shall at last lose all that respect which the people of this kingdom ought to have for their parliaments. If this should ever happen to be our case, which God forbid! our happy con|stitution would be at an end: Our people could not then be governed by parliaments, or by any sort of civil government. They must be ruled by a standing army and a military government.</Q></P>

<P>In the year 1728, the commons voted the orders given to <HI>Hosier</HI> just, prudent, and necessary; while the nation, and all <HI>Europe</HI> knew, that the unfortu|nate admiral, and his brave men, were sacrificed to the villainous schemes of a minister <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">USE AND. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> OF PARL.

<P><HI>Walpole</HI> was so pinched for money to gratify his harpyes, that he had nothing to spare for war against <HI>Spain,</HI> which treated <HI>England</HI> for many years with an insolence, that would have ill become the greatest power in <HI>Europe</HI> to the meanest.

<P>In the year 1742, the lords read, a second time <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, VIII.495.</NOTE>, a bill for quieting corporations, by which all enquiry and prosecution against mayors, aldermen, and other officers of towns, and their official proceedings, were to be null and void, unless commenced within a cer|tain limited time. This bill was occasioned by an appeal to the lords in consequence of violent means used by <HI>Walpole</HI> to compel the election of some of his creatures for <HI>Weymouth</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 482.</NOTE>. And such was the influence of ministerial power, that the sentence of the inferior court was confirmed, though so far from being unex|ceptionable, that lord <HI>Talbot,</HI> on the occasion, expres|sed himself as follows.</P>
<P><Q>Let us enquire, my lords, how we shall discharge the duty of judges by confirming the sentence which is now before us; let us examine, whether we shall act as the guardians of right, and the last resort of oppressed privilege, or whether we shall not ap|pear instruments of ministerial tyranny and the mean reporters of the sentence of an inferior court. By confirming this sentence, we shall not only deprive a magistrate of his office which he holds by a claim, which has been thought just for more than a century, and in the exercise of which it appears reasonable to
<PB N="458" REF="013851_0488_0F9E2A399115DB08">
believe that he is disturbed not for misbehaviour, but discharging his trust; but we shall entail upon the town and corporation perpetual confusion and distur|bance, evils which government was instituted to pre|vent; we shall suject them for ever to the authority of men untryed and unexperienced; and by conse|quence to all the mischiefs of ignorant, if not cor|rupt administration. This, my lords, is sufficient to determine my judgment; and, I hope, it will be of equal weight in that of others. I shall not wil|lingly interpret a charter, which is always an act of royal favour, to the disadvantage of them to whom it was granted; for I never heard of a charter of corruption, or ignorance, or misery; and since it is more happy to live without government, than to be governed ill, I cannot believe that a charter like this, as it is now interpreted, was ever given. I therefore conclude the judgment erroneous, and once more move that it may be reversed.</Q></P>
<P>The duke of <HI>Bedford</HI> said, on this occasion ^a, The absurdities of this construction' [of the char|ter of the town of <HI>Weymouth</HI>]
<Q>have already been explained by the noble lord, and are, indeed, such as cannot be aggravated, extenuated, or avoided. But by admitting that sense of the charter which has been for more than a century received, it is evident, from experience, the only sure test in such cases, that no inconveniencies will follow. This complaint of the violation of the charter did not arise from any sense of inconveniencies which it produced, or of injuries which the inhabitants of that place imagined themselves to receive from usur|pation
<PB N="459" REF="013851_0489_0F9E2A3A56848AA8">
or tyranny; it was not promoted by any man who thought himself unjustly debarred from autho|rity, or by any body of men excluded from their share in the government of the town. The prose|cution, my lords, was the effect of ministerial re|sentment; it was threatened to influence the election, and was executed, not to humble the haughtiness of guilt, but to crush the firmness of integrity; to punish those who could not be terrified, and to obtain for those the satisfaction of revenge, who had lost the pleasure of success. For this purpose an attorney, that was a stranger to the borough, was employed to harass the mayor with a prosecution defeated at the assizes, where men of plain sense were to determine the cause, but successful in the court of King's-bench, where law and subtility were ad|mitted. If such proceedings, my lords, should re|ceive a sanction from this great assembly, how long can any corporation hope to enjoy its privileges, after having dared to reject the overtures of the agents of a minister? Of what value will be the immunities which our kings have bestowed upon many cities of this kingdom as rewards of their loyalty, as encouragements to trade, as marks of honour and distinction, or for the more easy admi|nistration of government? If prosecutions like this be allowed, it will be at any time in the power of a subtle villain to deprive them of their rights, to disturb the exercise of lawful authority, to confound all subordination, to fill the courts of justice with expensive suits, and the whole with perplexity and terror. Such, my lords, will be the injustice of con|firming this sentence, and such the miseries which that act of injustice will bring upon us; and there|fore

I shall continue to oppose it; as I hope always to appear an advocate for right, and the happiness of my country.</Q></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Chesterfield</HI> in the debate on the same bill for quieting corporations <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. LORDS. VIII.526.</NOTE>, exposes, with great humour, the craft of ministers, and ministerial tools, which is the same with that of lawyers, and churchmen, when any reformation is proposed.
<Q>Suppose</Q>
(says he)
<Q>I were a minister, and was resolved to overturn the liberties of my country, by getting into my hands the absolute direction of our cities and boroughs, with regard to their elections, would not I oppose such a bill as this? I certainly would, but bad politician as I am, I would not be so very weak as to oppose it directly. No, I would ingenuously acknowledge the danger: I would acknowledge the necessity of doing something to prevent it: I would mourn over the dangerous state of public liberty; but then I would take great care to raise as many objections as I could to every regulation proposed for its defence. I would exaggerate every difficulty and inconvenience we might be exposed to by such a regulation; and if no real dangers of this kind could be suggested, imaginary ones would supply their place. This, my lords, has always been, and will always be, the method taken by those who have designs against our liberties, in order to obstruct such regulations as might defeat their designs.</Q></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Chesterfield</HI> afterwards observes, that all the lords acknowledged the usefulness of such a bill, though they seemed unwilling to do any thing in it at pre|sent. If the bill was imperfect, it was natural to
<PB N="461" REF="013851_0491_0F9E2A3BE7FD2EC0">
commit it for improvement. He apprehends, the house may lose credit by throwing it out. He shews, that the bill would not secure any magistrate of a cor|poration in acting contrary to justice and the standing laws. That the worst consequence will be an unqua|lified person's being chosen a magistrate, or chosen in an irregular manner. But, if prosecution against him is commenced in due time, the bill would not protect him.
<Q>A noble lord,</Q>
says he,
<Q>was pleased to call our corporations the creatures of the crown. Too many of them, my lords, are so: I am for making them less so; and am therefore for having this bill passed into a law; for whatever bad consequences it may be attended with, I am sure they cannot be so bad as the consequences of our neglecting or delaying to make any regulation for guarding against or re|moving the danger to which we are at present expos|ed. It has been said, my lords, that no attempts have been lately made upon the freedom of our cor|porations: 'Tis true no such violent attempts have been lately made as were made in former reigns; but even lately, and but very lately too, the freedom of our corporations has been nibbled at, and that nib|bling has been made so manifest by the report I have mentioned, that I am surprised to hear the contrary asserted by any lord in this house. I must suppose, that such lords have never read that report, and must there|fore recommend it to their serious perusal; for they will thence see not only that corporations have been pro|secuted at the expence of the crown, for the neglect of insignificant formalities; but that the cause of the prosecution's being brought, was expressly their refu|sing to chuse such representatives as the minister
<PB N="462" REF="013851_0492_0F9E2A3CB191AAB0">
directed. Was not this an attempt against the free|dom of our corporations? My lords, it was an at|tempt not only against the freedom of that particular corporation, but of all our corporations, because the magistrates of every corporation in the kingdom will from thence see the consequence of their being diso|bedient to the commands of a minister; and the ex|ample must necessarily have most fatal effect, if we do not, by some new law, remove or lessen the dread of being exposed to the same consequence. But sup|pose we had no such manifest pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f: suppose no such terrifying example had lately been made; from the very nature of the thing, we must be convinced, that such attempts may be made. They have been made by all ministers in time past. They will be made by all ministers in time to come. It is natural for a minister to wish to have his friend chosen to repre|sent any city or borough, rather than one he suspects to be his enemy. It is natural for him to make use of every method he can safely practise in favour of his friend's election. Whilst a corporation, or the magistrates of a corporation, are under apprehensions of being prosecuted, it is natural for them to be swayed by those fears. There is no way of prevent|ing this practice, but by free<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng a corporation from any such apprehensions: and as this will, in a great measure, be the effect of the bil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> now before us, after it has been properly amended in the committee, I hope your lordships will agree to the question.</Q></P>
<P>The earl of <HI>Islay,</HI> always faithful to the ministe|rial cause, laid great stress on the incroachment, the bill would make upon the king's, that is, the mini|ster's royal prerogative; but he takes, according to
<PB N="463" REF="013851_0493_0F9E2A3D4F6E2648">
his laudable custom, particular care to shew, that the subject's liberty was in no danger, and to turn all regard to it into ridicule.
<Q>As the necessity of our having some such bill passed into a law, has been very much cryed up in this debate; as this neces|sity has been said to have been acknowledged by every lord who has spoke in the debate, I must take this opportunity to declare, that I am very far from being convinced of our being under any such necessity. I do not think the crown has as yet such an influence over our cities and boroughs as can be of any dangerous consequence, nor do I think a minister can with any safety endeavour to acquire such an influence. A minister may have a personal, or a family interest in two or three boroughs; he cannot by himself alone represent them all; and to the borough where he does not stand himself, it is very natural for him to recommend a friend. That friend may, perhaps, be a gentle|man never before known in the borough; but this is not peculiar to ministers: for we often find such gentlemen chosen by boroughs upon the recommen|dation of those who are known to be violent enemies to the minister. I, therefore, do not well know what is meant by court boroughs. All boroughs are so, I believe, and all cities and counties, as well as boroughs. The only difference is, that some boroughs have their friends in court, and others want to have their friends in court. This, my lords, has always been the chief ground of the dis|pute; and most people are apt to think, or at least to say, the country is in danger when their friends happen to be out of court. The cry of the church being in danger, was formerly made the same use
<PB N="464" REF="013851_0494_0F9E2A3FA546C150">
of; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d when I was young, and attended this house behind the throne, I remember to have heard it observed, as I thought very justly, by the ancestor of a noble lord I have in my eye, that the only reason he could think of for saying that the church was in danger, was, because the earl of <HI>Rochester</HI> was out of court. If a borough therefore chuses a courtier, it is not because it is more a court borough than any other borough, but because its friends happen at that time to be in court; in like manner, when a borough chuses such as are against the court, it is not because it is more a country borough than any other, but because its friends happen then to be out of court; and the choice made by the former may as little pro|ceed from any undue influence, as the choice made by the latter. But every borough that chuses a courtier, or a friend to the minister, must, it seems, be a creature of the crown in the sense put upon the words by the noble lord who spoke last, in which, I must say he made a very bad use, to call it by no worse name, of an expression dropt from a noble lord in this debate. The noble lord happened to say that all corporations were the creatures of the crown, and when he made use of the expression, I believe every one of your lordships understood what he meant. He certainly meant no more than that all corporations were created by the crown, which is true; but the noble lord who spoke last, gave it a turn as if he had meant that all corporations are the slaves of the crown, and ready to receive directions from the ministers of the crown, which is as far from being true as it is far from being what he meant; for with regard to the election of their representa|tives, I know of no way by which a minister can

compel any one of them to chuse the candidates he recommends. I am sure that of threatening a bo|rough with a <HI>quo warranto,</HI> would be very far from be|ing effectual, and it would be very dangerous for any minister to make use of such a method; consequently I cannot as yet see the necessity of our passing any such bill as the present; and if I did, I should be for drop-this bill, which I think cannot be so amended as to be of any use, in order to have a bill brought in that might be of some service <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. II.350.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It was afterwards ordered, that a new bill should be drawn up. Lord <HI>Romney</HI> reported the heads of it, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That a reasonable period of time be fixed, after the expiration of which the rights, franchises, and liberties of any city, corporation, or borough, in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Wales,</HI> or of any members of any such city, corporation, &amp;c. or of any person exercising any such office or franchise, shall not be called in question by informations in nature of <HI>quo warranto,</HI> writs o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>mandamus,</HI> or other proceedings for any in|formality, irregularity, or defect in the nomination, election, admission, or swearing of the mayor, bai|liffs, or freemen, or of any other officer, or member (by what name soever called) of any such city, cor|poration, &amp;c. who now are, or at any time here|after, shall be in the actual possession or exercise of any such office or franchise, nor of any forfeiture or disability arising from such informality, irregularity or defect, unless such informality, irregularity, or defect, or such forfeiture, or disability shall be taken advantage of by some prosecution commenced for that purpose, within a certain time after the com|mencement of the bill. And as to any such officer
<PB N="466" REF="013851_0496_0F9E2A4280C065E8">
or member, as hereafter, within a certain number of years to be limited in the bill, shall have been ad|mitted into or shall have been in the actual possession or exercise of any such office or franchise as aforesaid; every such prosecution to be carried on with effect and due diligence; and in case of affected or unneces|sary delay on the part of the prosecutor, to be dis|missed with full costs.

LORDS, VIII.535.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Romney</HI> shewed the usefulness of such a bill for defeating the efforts of ministerial power. That members of corporations are commonly men of plain understandings, not qualified to search into the mean|ing of old charters; but willing to follow preceden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and therefore their cases are more pitiable than blame|able, when they happen to proceed in such a manner as renders them obnoxious to the letter of the law. That the charters themselves are often, through length of time, and change of circumstances, become unfit to be observed. That the meaning of corporation-charters may not always be clear and consistent. That it is difficult and expensive to solicit new charters; and ministers are not inclinable to favour them, because, like the lawyers, they find their ad|vantage in the subject's uncertainty. That it is a ticklish affair for a corporation to resign its charter, when it is unknown what sort of one it shall have in exchange. That therefore it is natural for the mem|bers of corporations to modify their proceedings ac|cording to what they find by experience to be best,
<PB N="467" REF="013851_0497_0F9E2A4296D76598">
though in so doing they may often gradually deviate from the letter of their charter. That it will be no more than a reasonable indulgence to the subjects in a matter, in which the hazard is theirs, and not the government's, to fix a time, after which custom and precedent in corporations shall pass into establish|ment.</P>
<P>One would imagine, this was no such mighty matter of grace to confer on the good people. But the ministerial tools have no inclination to give up any degree of power. Therefore lord <HI>Cholmondeley,</HI> a faithful friend to court-power, opposed the bill. The houses agreeing to it, he said, would be acting in the dark, confirming practices, which they did not un|derstand, and supporting magistrates, who obtained, and executed their offices, they knew not how, &amp;c. [A staunch ministerial man is never for leaving any thing to the <HI>people</HI>; even their <HI>own</HI> affairs. He will have them always <HI>feel,</HI> that they have a government, that is, a <HI>tyranny,</HI> over them.]
<Q>I am not much in|clined, says he, to believe, when I see the law broken, that the <HI>law</HI> is to be blamed.</Q>
[I am sorry to differ from his lordship; but I should be very apt to suspect the wisdom of a law, if I saw it often broken by <HI>sober</HI> and <HI>regular</HI> people, such as the mem|bers of corporations commonly are.] Lord <HI>Romney</HI> said, the quieting bill would be an encouragement to transgressors. It would be confirming to the thief the possession of the goods he had stolen. [But it is remarkable, that his good lordship should not recol|lect, that by the law, as it <HI>now</HI> stands, there is a <HI>li|mited</HI> time, which being elapsed, many offences, more atrocious than violating a borough-charter, are not to be prosecuted, or punished.]</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="013851_0498_0F9E296256A55918">And the good lord chancellor <HI>Hardwicke</HI> (always true to the ministry) was afraid, the quieting bill might
<Q>produce more and greater evils, than those it was intended to cure.</Q>
Whether it was a greater evil for corporations to be secure against ministerial molestation, than their being from time to time un|der prosecution, and by that means obliged to bring some grist to the law-mill, I leave to the reader to decide. In general, we know, that lawyers and churchmen are always against reformations. His good lordship
<Q>must suppose, that the distemper intended to be cured, or rather prevented, by the bill, was as yet imaginary <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, VIII.512.</NOTE>.</Q>
Good men always believe the best. Therefore his good lordship believed <HI>Walpole</HI> as inno|cent of molesting corporations, as of patriotism, or public spirit. But his good chancellorship seemed in the sequel of his speech, a little to forget his law-learning, through zeal against the bill.
<Q>If, says he, you limit the prescription to a <HI>very short</HI> time, it will be of the most dangerous consequence; and if you fix it at a <HI>very long</HI> term, the bill could have lit|tle or no effect.</Q>
But what if we fix it at a term nei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her <HI>very long,</HI> nor <HI>very short?</HI> Besides, if his lordship's reasonings be good, the laws, by which (as above observed) a term is fixed, after which pro|secutions for greater offences, than making free with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et of blind old charters granted by the tyrannical <HI>Stuarts,</HI> are set aside; are <HI>all bad,</HI> and his lordship ought to have moved for their repeal. But your true ministerial men, like your true churchmen, never care how inconsistent they be with <HI>themselves,</HI> or with the principles of <HI>common sense</HI>; so they be orthodox,
<PB N="469" REF="013851_0499_0F9E29634CFA1908">
that is upon the <HI>right</HI> side, that is upon the side of <HI>power.</HI> He afterwards brings the exec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able maxim, <HI>nullum tempus occurrit regi,</HI> now abolished, in support of his doctrine, and argues, that as no period stops the king's claim, so no period ought to tie up the minister's hands from molesting corporations, who elect anti-ministerial members <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, VIII.512.</NOTE>. Then he comes to an important argument indeed. The bill
<Q>might be said to be a sort of encroachment upon the preroga|tives of the crown.</Q>
<HI>Hinc illae lacrymae!</HI> The prero|gatives of the crown are the ministry's <HI>Palladium</HI>; and are of infinitely more consequence (to them) than the quiet of ten thousand corporations. On this he argues in such a manner, that one would really think, he had forgot, that the <HI>British</HI> government was a <HI>limited</HI> monarchy.
<Q>As the king (says he) has the <HI>sole</HI> right of establishing corporations, he likewise has a right to take care, that the corporation, as well as every officer and magistrate who belongs to it, shall observe the rules <HI>he</HI> has been pleased to <HI>prescribe</HI> to them in their charter; and to <HI>limit his power</HI> of pro|secuting for any neglect, or non-observance, to a very short term, is an encroachment upon his <HI>right.</HI></Q>
Have our limited kings any right <HI>uncontroulable</HI> by <HI>parliament</HI> to establish, or prescribe? His lordship shines afterwards more and more.
<Q>I must farther observe, my lords, that this bill is really a sort of re|peal of those laws, which have always been deemed the <HI>security</HI> of our <HI>church</HI> as by law established. When I say this, every lord must suppose I mean the <HI>corpo|ration</HI> and <HI>test acts</HI>; for if this bill be passed into a law the most rigid <HI>dissenter</HI> might get himself chosen an
<PB N="470" REF="013851_0500_0F9E296428C7D5A8">
<HI>alderman</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> or a magistrate of some other city or borough, without taking the oaths, or conform|ing to what is required by law for the <HI>purity</HI> of our church; and if he escapes being prosecuted during the time to be limited by this bill, he might continue in that magistracy during life, without ever conform|ing himself to the established church, for the act does not require his conforming after he is elected; and after the expiration of that time his election could not be declared void on account of his not hav|ing conformed within the year preceding his election; so that if this bill was passed into a law, all the ma|gistrates in our cities or boroughs, who are chosen for life, might be such as openly frequented <HI>conven|ticles</HI>; for if they did not go there in their habits and ensigns of magistracy, they could neither be removed nor <HI>punished</HI> for the <HI>affront</HI> put upon the established <HI>church.</HI></Q></P>
<P>What a noble spirit of liberty, how worthy of a lord chancellor of this great and free nation, and how suitable to the light and knowledge prevalent in this age, does this part of his lordship's speech ex|hibit!
<Q>Our church as by law established!</Q>
Aye&mdash;Our church!&mdash;our monopoly of fat livings, from which we have by law established, that all men shall be <HI>excluded,</HI> who will not declare assent and con|sent to the clear and <HI>self-consistent</HI> articles and creeds, and to the <HI>passive-obedience homilies!</HI> And the <Q>test and corporation acts!

<P>Lord <HI>Sandwich</HI> then went on to shew <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, VIII.520.</NOTE>, That the worst effect of the bill would be, to oblige those who had a mind to prosecute for irregularities in corpora|tions, to do it within a reasonable time, when proofs and defences could be brought. But this did not answer the views of ministers; their point is, to keep a <HI>rod</HI> over the <HI>people</HI>'s head at <HI>all</HI> times. Lord <HI>Sand|wich</HI> afterwards<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 521.</NOTE> puts the house in mind of what curious <HI>Walpolian</HI> proceedings had been detected by the secret committee relating to this very corporation, on a mere misinterpretation of their charter, or rather a different interpretation of it from the sense put upon it by the judges, which sense had not been found in it by the persons who first obtained it, nor by their successors, for 130 years.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="013851_0502_0F9E2969154D4328"><HI>A. D.</HI> 1764, it was resolved by the house of com|mons, and agreed to by the house of lords,
<Q>That privilege of parliament does not extend to the case of writing and publishing seditious libels, nor ought to obstruct the ordinary course of the laws in the speedy and effectual prosecution of so heinous and dangerous an offence.</Q>
Seventeen peers, among which number was <HI>(mirabile dictu!)</HI> one bishop, pro|tested, because the doctrine was new, unwarrant|able, and unknown to the most tyrannical times; the established custom being, that privilege of parlia|ment takes place in all cases, but treason, felony, breach of the peace, or refusing to obey a writ of <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI>; whereas the writing or publishing of what may be called (for any thing may be so called) a seditious libel, is neither treason, felony, breach of peace, nor disobedience to <HI>Habeas Corpus.</HI> The protesting peers alledged, that the resolution was sacrificing the freedom of parliament to ministerial power. That the resolution not only infringed the privilege of parliament but tended to the restraint of every man's personal liberty seeing it affirms, that all men may be bound to the peace for writing what may be called a seditious libel, by which every man's liberty is surrendered into the hands of a secretary of state, who is hereby impowered to pronounce any writing a seditious libel, and to imprison any person on this account, without council, evidence, or jury, while the person oppressed by power has no redress against the secretary of state, as he acts in the capacity of a judge. The protesting lords conclude with the following remarkable words;
<Q>Privilege was not made to skreen criminals, but to preserve the very being and life of parliament; for when our ancestors con|sidered
<PB N="473" REF="013851_0503_0F9E296A86B4F310">
that the law had lodged the great powers of arrest, indictment, and information in the crown, they saw the parliament would be undone, if during the time of privilege the royal process should be admitted in any misdemeanour whatsoever, therefore they excepted none. Where the abuse of power would be fatal, the power ought never to be given, because redress comes too late. A parliament under perpetual terror of imprisonment can neither be free, nor bold, nor honest; and if this privilege was once removed, the most important question might be irrecoverably lost, or carried by a sudden irruption of messengers let loose against the members half an hour be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore the debate. Lastly, as it has already been observed, the case of supposed libels is, above all others, the most dangerous and alarming to be left open to prosecution during the time of privilege. If the severity of the law touching libels, as it hath sometimes been laid down, be duly weighed, it must strike both houses of parliament with terror and dismay. The repetition of a libel, the delivery of it unread to another, is said to be a publication, nay, the bare possession of it has been deemed cri|minal, unless it is immediately destroyed or carried to a magistrate. Every lord of parliament then, who hath done this, who is falsely accused, nay, who is, though without any information, named in the secretary of state's warrant, has lost his privi|lege by this resolution, and lies at the mercy of that enemy to learning and liberty, the messenger of the press. For these and many other forcible reasons, we hold it highly unbecoming the dignity, gravity, and wisdom of the house of peers, as well as their justice, thus judicially to explain away and dimi|nish

<P>The brave parliament, in which sate the <HI>Hampdens</HI> and the <HI>Pyms,</HI> would not allow this in the case of the 5 members; though the tyrant directly accused them of high treason, which cannot by law plead privilege.

<P>Again in the year 1771, the house of commons&punc; in a fit of complaisance for the court (if that can be called a <HI>fit,</HI> from which the patient is never clear) voted, that a member concerned in a libel should have no right to his privilege, thereby putting the guilt of a just satire on a corrupt court upon the same foot with that of felony, or breach of the peace, the only crimes, which before that time deprived a mem|ber of his privilege.

<HI>German</HI> wars for the defence of <HI>Hanover,</HI> forced Mr. <HI>Pitt,</HI> the great opposer of continental connexions, in|to power, in spite of <HI>Geo.</HI> II. who was thought to at|tend more to the interest of his pitiful electorate, than to that of the <HI>British</HI> empire.

do our superiors endeavour to persuade us, by their words, that they are gods, while their actions shew them to be generally very silly, and very worthless mortals.</P>
<P>In the year 1770, there were as many compli|ments bandied between the court, and parliament, as ever. Yet at that time, almost every part of the <HI>British</HI> empire was known to be dissatisfied; the peo|ple of <HI>England</HI> enraged against their representatives, and petitioning the king for a new parliament; the people of <HI>Ireland</HI> offended on account of the proroga|tion of their parliament, because they would support the constitutional manner of taxation, and the colo|nists provoked by our legislature's taxing them as a test of their obedience.</P>
<P>In that same year, Sir <HI>George Savile,</HI> no party-brawler, said in the house of commons,
<Q>This house hath betrayed the rights of the people.</Q>
Sir <HI>Alex. Gilmour</HI> called him to order. General <HI>Conway</HI> said the words were reprehensible. That it was insulting parliament, and that members had been sent to the Tower for such words, but as he believed they were spoken in anger, he only should wish that for the future the gentleman would be more cautious.

That the law knew nothing of gentlemen; that we, who represented, were chosen by, and derived our powers from those base born men; and that their privileges ought to be the care of the house, for on them de|pended our own,&mdash;our constitution. Mr. <HI>Edmund Burke,</HI> likewise, with great spirit, defended Sir <HI>George Saville,</HI> and called upon the ministry to punish Sir <HI>George,</HI> if the accusation was false; and said,

but added,
<Q>that the ministers were conscious of the truth of the assertion, and therefore in a tame and cowardly manner crouched under it.</Q>
He said, the people abhorred the present ministry, and asked the speaker if the chair did not tremble under him. Towards the conclusion of the debate, Sir <HI>George Savile</HI> stood up again and declared, that he was as cool as before; more so he could not be; and added from <HI>Shakespeare,</HI>

therefore,
<Q>standing up in my place as member for the county of <HI>York,</HI> I do declare, that the house of commons, has betrayed the rights of the nation.</Q>

<P><PB N="480" REF="013851_0510_0F9E2972F70F5A28">If opinion be the great engine, by which the few are able to govern the many, what shall we say of the wisdom of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hose governors, who by the practice of every foul and sordid art, and by openly shewing a total neglect of the public interest, teach the people to look upon their superiors as their worst enemies, or as clumsy blockheads, who do not know the first principles of their own posession?</P>
<P>However it is come to pass, the fact is certain, that in no age, or nation, ever was the people's opinion of their governors at a lower ebb, than has been lately seen in a certain country. In former times, when the characters of statesmen were attacked in print, the writers used caution, and either described them by their behaviour, in such a manner as to point them out without naming them, or if they were more par|ticular, at most they only put initials and finals. Now our political and satirical writers make no hesitation in calling our highest characters to their faces, and with their names printed at full length, rogues, and whores, corruptors, plunderers, and enemies of their country.</P>
<P>This I acknowledge to be utterly inconsistent with decency. But still it marks strongly the sentiments of the people. And it must likewise be owned, that a great deal of the invective, that is thrown out in times of general dissatisfaction, is always aggravated, and often wholly groundless. But had our governors kept up a conduct venerable for integrity, and amiable for disinterested attachment to the public good, the people would never have thought of treating them in a manner so openly disrespectful. Even the gross-minded mob, when wrought up to the highest rage, would avoid throwing dirt upon a <HI>Socrates,</HI> a <HI>Cato,</HI> or a <HI>Hampden.</HI></P>

<P>How deep the politics of the times were, may be judged by the following: <HI>A.

They mention the <HI>Middlesex</HI> election, the imprisoning of the lord mayor, and alderman <HI>Oliver,</HI> for
<Q>not obeying the illegal mandates of an arbitrary house of commons, and violating the solemn oaths they had taken for the preservation of the franchises of the capital. We recal (say they) to your majesty's remembrance with horror, that unparalleled act of tyranny, the erasing a judicial record, in order to stop the course of justice, to introduce a system of power against right,</Q>
&amp;c. They pray a dissolution of par|liament, and a removal of bad ministers.</P>
<P>So much for a brief chronological deduction of ministerial and corrupt influence in parliament, in|tended to shew the necessity of a redress of this most ruinous of all grievances.</P>
<P>From a due consideration of what this first volume alone exhibits, which is but a small part of the public abuses of the times, every thoughtful reader will see great reason for fears and apprehensions. The time to prevent public disorders is, Now, before the disor|ders begin. The beginning of the public disorders, we have reason to apprehend, will be, a diminution of the value of Stocks. It is the interest of every man in the <HI>British</HI> empire to prevent this diminution. The means of preventing it are, Associations for sup|port of public credit. A model for these associations we have by looking back to the transactions of the year 1745. Public credit cannot sink, if the nation unites in supporting it; and the time for this union is NOW, before it begins to totter. Should it even be found, (which God forbid) that the usual ways and means are likely, through failure of commerce, &amp;c. to come short of a sufficiency for paying the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

creditors their full dividend, <HI>England</HI> has still great resources untouched, as taxing all legacies left by others than parents, husbands and wives, introducing by degrees Sir <HI>Matth. Decker</HI>'s method of taxation, and lessening by degrees the number of our present tax-gatherers, reducing the devouring army, taxing saddle- horses, and other articles of luxury, and all public diversions, reducing the enormous number, and retrenching the exorbitant incomes of places, &amp;c. of all which more fully hereafter.</P>
<P>May a beam of celestial light directed by that effica|cious voice, which of old said, Let there be light; irradiate the mind of Him, whom Divine Providence hath placed supreme in the government of this great empire; that he may see the things, which belong to his and the nation's peace, before they be for ever hid from his eyes. And when, guided by that hea|venly light, he sets himself at the head of a plan for reforming these, and the other abuses, which are the disgrace, and naturally tend to bring on the ruin of the state, may he find his people willing to second those views, the execution of which will obtain for him the most illustrious of all titles, <HI>viz.</HI> Father of his country; and will make <HI>Britain</HI> the glory of all lands.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO VOLUME THE SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL, perhaps, be accused of deviating to|wards superstition, if I observe, that the favourable reception given by the public to the former volume of these collections has the appearance of a good <HI>omen,</HI> that the people will at last direct their attention to the important subjects treated in them, and to the fearful and alarming condition, into which the villainous arts of a succession of wicked ministers have brought this great empire; and that they will be no longer abused by those at the helm; but will insist upon such a change of measures as may save our country, if our sins have not unchangeably pointed against us the vengeance of the supreme Governor of states and kingdoms.</P>
<P>I am afraid, the public has found in the former volume, and will find in this, many inaccuracies, as well as other deficiencies, not such as the great <HI>Roman</HI> critic comprehends under his phrase, <HI>maculae, quas incuria fudit</HI>; for indeed I cannot accuse myself of carelessness in preparing these collections for the public, excepting only that I have not pretended to bestow much time in polishing and working up the style of those parts which are written by me; because indeed, as I have hinted in the general preface, I
<PB N="vi" REF="013851_0523_0F9E2985F132D940">
should have thought such labour supererogatory and impertinent in a work of this kind. The inaccura|cies I am anxious about, are those, which <HI>Horace</HI> understands by the words immediately following the above-quoted, <HI>quas humana parum cavit natura,</HI> those faults, to which the weakness of human nature, or of such poor abilities as mine at least, exposes a writer, as a less advantageous disposition of the mat|ter, a seeming repetition of the same thoughts, and the like. My apology for these deformities must be drawn from the vastness of the variety of the matter I had to dispose of, which made it difficult to re|member every thought and fact I had set down, and made it almost impossible to avoid repeating some of the same thoughts and arguments, as they occur re|peatedly in the different quotations I have collected, and I could not always leave out the part, which was a repetition, without disfiguring the speeches in such a manner, as would have made them incohe|rent, and displeasing to the reader.</P>
<P>The public will, I hope, agree, that it was better to insert a weighty argument twice, than to run the hazard of leaving it out, through suspicion of its being already inserted.</P>
<P>I hope it will be acknowledged, that far the greatest part of the matter I have collected from au|thors and speakers in parliament, is weighty, forci|ble, pertinent to the purpose for which I advance it,
<PB N="vii" REF="013851_0524_0F9E29876A079908">
and decisive upon the great political points proposed to be determined.</P>
<P>I beg leave just to mention, that the IId book, which treats of the COLONIES, differs from the others, both in the former volume and this, in that there is a great deal of the matter in it, not written by me, and yet not referred to the respective authors, from whom I extracted it, particularly what I have transcribed from a collection in 6 or 8 volumes 8vo. being a set of all the best pamphlets and tracts writ|ten since the beginning of the contest between <HI>Britain</HI> and the colonies. When I collected from those volumes, the passages, which are inserted in the IId book of this volume, I neglected quoting the pages of the authors, and could not afterwards, without more labour than the matter was worth, because the authority of those pamphlets and tracts is not of great consequence, unless readers will make farther en|quiry, or happen, which is generally the case, to know that what is affirmed in them is true.</P>

[ministerial influence in parliament will soon bring <HI>chaos and eternal night</HI> upon <HI>England,</HI> if not dissipated by the exertion of the spirit of a brave people] to speak plain prose; after tracing out such a multitude of foul and shameful instances of the ascendancy ob|tained

by fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gitious courts over parliament, it may be some relief (it will certainly be some instruction) to the reader, to observe the <HI>difference</HI> between the conduct of <HI>corrupt,</HI> and that of <HI>uninfluenced</HI> parliaments.</P>
<P>What a parliament compleatly <HI>independent</HI> would be; and what parliaments accordingly have sometimes been, may, in some measure, be conceived from this chapter, which he who can read, comparing the idea here given of incorrupt parliaments with what we have seen in our debauched times; the <HI>Englishman,</HI> I say, who can read what follows without grief and indignation, must either be <HI>incapable</HI> of forming any judgment, wherein the interest of his country lies, and <HI>ignorant</HI> of what intimately concerns every subject of the <HI>British</HI> empire; or he must be <HI>void</HI> of all re|gard for his country, and consequently of every vir|tuous attachment; or he must be attached to an in|terest <HI>contrary</HI> to that of his country, by the sordid love of money, as being himself a dealer in rank bribery and corruption.</P>
<P>Every free <HI>Briton</HI> has reason to wish that darkness may overshadow the anniversary of <HI>his</HI> birth, who first introduced places and pensions into parliament. When I have made a few observations on the complexion of parliaments in those times, in which it is certain that the court did not, because it could not influence them by emolumentary means, every reader who recol|lects any thing of the politics of modern times (the present always excepted) will, on making a com|parison, join me in saying
<Q><L>Hoc fonte derivata clades</L>
<L>In patriam populumque sluxit.</L>
<BIBL>HOR.</BIBL></Q>
From this impure fountain flows the stream, which is likely to poison our country and posterity.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="013851_0534_0F9E299314F02738">In ancient times, when the parliaments of <HI>England</HI> were unpensioned, we find them, even in spite of <HI>Popish</HI> darkness, and of the extravagant notions of prerogative which were the disgrace of those ages, ever faithfully labouring for the public good, and especially seizing all opportunities for obtaining an enlargement of liberty.</P>
<P>So early as 1290, we find a set of unjust judges mulcted by parliament, to the amount of 100,000 marks. The parliament obtained of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. a promise, that he would contrary to the usage of former times) quit all pretension to the right of levy|ing taxes by his own authority, and would raise none but with consent of the
<Q>archbishops, bishops, and other prelates, earls, barons, knights (of shires), bur|gesses, and other freemen of this realm.</Q>
The nume|rous confirmations of <HI>Magna Charta</HI> were obtained by parliaments, and always with reluctance on the part of the kings, as the first grant was extorted by the barons (which, by the bye, shews the justness of the obser|vation, that parliaments are as naturally friends to liberty as kings are to prerogative.) So high was the reputation of the commons, in the same reign, for integrity and judgment, that the barons proposed to the king, that they should have the choice of the chancellor, chief justice, and other great officers of state. To which that prince answered them by ask|ing, Why they did not demand his crown? That they chose their own servants: Why might not he enjoy the same privilege? [not considering that the people are deeply <HI>concerned</HI> in the choice of the <HI>king</HI>'s servants; whereas no body has any thing to do with these of a <HI>duke</HI> or an <HI>earl.</HI>] In <HI>Edw.</HI> IIId's time, we find the commons refusing to grant an aid, till they had consulted their constituents. [In those days, they con|sidered
<PB N="4" REF="013851_0535_0F9E2993DB156150">
themselves as responsible not to the ministry, but the people.] In the same reign we find it recorded by historians,
<Q>That since the aids given in the last parliament were not duly answered to the king by those who had the care thereof, certain persons were appointed to take the accounts of <HI>William de la Pole,</HI> and others, who had received the money, wool, [taxes were, in those days, often paid in wool] &amp;c. and they had a day assigned them to produce their accounts, and in the mean time several noblemen and gentlemen of fortune became bound, &amp;c.</Q>
[This was the true way of preventing complaints against defaulters of millions.] In the same reign (about four hundred years ago) we find the commons refusing to grant supplies till grievances were redressed; fixing by law what shall be deemed treason; proposing regulations for preventing the subjects being compelled to make loans to the king, for that it was
<Q>against reason, and the franchise of the land;</Q>
making an act for holding annual parliaments [no ministerial schemes to be gained by rewarding, with places and pensions, those who voted seven years together as they were bid] limiting the power of the clergy and the lawyers; preventing the union, in the same persons, of legislative power and of court emoluments, by a law prohibiting any collector of taxes to represent any place in parliament; [so early were our ancestors aware of the usefulness of a place-bill, repeatedly rejected in our degenerate times.] In <HI>Rich.</HI> IId's days, we find the commons requesting that he would inform them how the public money was laid out, and who were to be his counsel|lors and great officers; to which request they insisted on, and obtained an <HI>answer.</HI> In the same reign the commons refuse to lay any taxes on the people, because they were disgusted, as had just before appeared by
<PB N="5" REF="013851_0536_0F9E2994EE5027C8">
<HI>Wat Tyler</HI>'s insurrection. [In those days some regard was shewn to the sense of even the lowest of the people.] The commons request the removal of <HI>Michael de la Pole.</HI> The king gives them an answer in character, that is, a silly one. But they insist on compliance, and after some struggles, not only over|throw the minister, but at last dethrone the king him|self. The parliament appoints a commission of en|quiry to try the favourites. They impeach them of engaging the king to stand by them, right or wrong; of excluding all persons without the circle of the junto; of embezzling the public money, of laws dis|pensed with; of unjust punishments and pardons; of bribes taken of both parties, &amp;c. In consequence, the archbishop and others are declared guilty of high treason, <HI>Michael de la Pole</HI> is impeached, the high treasurer, <HI>Tresilian, Brembre,</HI> and many others, are hanged. [Thus in the heat of their honest zeal for the public good, overleaping their due boundaries, as a <HI>third</HI> part only of the legislature, and breaking into the sphere of the executive. See vol. i. p. 205. <HI>et seq.</HI>] Yet this very parliament, in the midst of severity, remembers decency. They make an express resolution for exempting the king, and laying the whole blame on his ministers. Happy had he stopped while his ruin might have been prevented! They oblige him to renew his coronation oath. [Kings often want to have their memories refreshed on this subject.] He shews a mighty desire of holding the reins of government in his own hand. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o sooner gets power, than he shews his incapacity for being trusted with it. He displaces all the faithful servants of the state, to make room for his worthless favourites. He seizes the charters of <HI>London,</HI> im|prisons the mayor and sheriffs, fines the city, and
<PB N="6" REF="013851_0537_0F9E299560A1F160">
losing the inestimable affections of the inhabitants of the capital, hastens his own destruction. He tries to pack parliaments, to influence returning officers, to force elections, to raise money without parliament; obtains, by unfair means, the opinions of his servile judges in favour of his wicked measures; the very proceedings which afterwards brought <HI>Charles</HI> I. to the block. [If the old saying be true, <HI>experientia docet stultos,</HI> it is plain, that kings are not fools; for experience does not teach some of them.] The parliament impeaches him for unwarrantable liberality to worthless favour|ites; encouraging a junto to take upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m par|liamentary power; causing the parliament roll to be altered and blotted at his pleasure; forbidding his subjects to petition him; sending into the house men not elected by the people, but nominated by himself; biassing members by threats and promises; refusing the faithful advice of his subjects, and threatening those who offered it, &amp;c. The parliament formally dethrones him, as is known to every reader.</P>
<P>Uninfluenced parliaments, instead of giving, as we have seen, the people's money by millions upon every call of the minister, have been remarkably delicate upon that point.</P>
<P><HI>Hen.</HI> III. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1255, demands an aid. Parliament requires two conditions, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. Observance of the two charters; and 2. That parliament have the ap|pointing of the justiciary, treasurer, and chancellor. <HI>Henry,</HI> instead of complying, prologues the parlia|ment <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rapin,</HI> I.329.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The struggle between <HI>Ch.</HI> I. and his brave and free parliament is one of the most striking instances in the history of the world, of the glorious effects pro|duced
<PB N="7" REF="013851_0538_0F9E299A11508690">
by the love of liberty and their country in the uninfluenced minds of a set of honest and courageous representatives. Let us contemplate a few instances of what is so much to the honour of human nature.</P>
<P>When that prince begun to demand money of par|liament, there was great opposition made. <HI>Pym,</HI> and the other patriots, said, the war was entered into rashly, and therefore the nation was not obliged to support it. He demanded an account of the money raised by <HI>Iames</HI> I. by resumption of crown-lands, and sale of titles and places. The commons accordingly, instead of supplies, proceeded to the consideration of grievances <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. VI.402.</NOTE>. The king dissolves the parliament, because they would grant nothing <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 403.</NOTE> When he sent repeated messages to the commons, pressing them to go upon <HI>supplies,</HI> and let <HI>grievances</HI> alone, Sir <HI>Robert Philips</HI> proposed to address the king, and let him know what they intended to do, if he would not interrupt them. If the king would not suffer them to go on with the public business, they must then depart in peace, and every man betake himself to prayer, that the confusions to be apprehended might be averted. The speaker, by the king's order, interrupts Sir <HI>I. El|liot</HI> in his remarks on the conduct of the ministry. Upon this, Sir <HI>Dudley Digges</HI> said,
<Q>If we must not speak of these things in parliament, let us be gone.</Q>
A mournful silence, for some time, ensued. Then Sir <HI>Nathaniel Rich</HI> observed,
<Q>That it was necessary they should take care of those, who sent them to par|liament;</Q>
and proposed to go to the lords, and, with them, wait on the king. The commons resolve, that neither Sir <HI>I. Elliot</HI> (who was interrupted by the slavish speaker) nor any other member, had spoken any
<PB N="8" REF="013851_0539_0F9E299AE85EC338">
thing undutiful during that parliament. A committee is ordered to consider what may be done for the safety of the kingdom, and that no member leave the house, on pain of being sent to the Tower. The speaker desired to go out for half an hour. Mr. <HI>Kirton</HI> ob|served, that this was unprecedented and ominous. It was observed by Mr. <HI>Kirton</HI> (with too much good-nature) that the king was a good prince; but per|suaded by enemies to him and the nation.
<Q>Let us try to discover them,</Q>
says he,
<Q>and I doubt not, but God will lend us hearts, hands, and swords, to cut all his and our enemies throats.</Q>
Sir <HI>Edw. Coke</HI> observed,
<Q>That greater moderation never was known, than theirs had been, considering, that their liberties had been so shamefully violated. That former parliaments had boldly pointed out evil coun|sellors about the kings.</Q>
[He mentions several in|stances; but, as they occur in other parts of these collections, I shall not enumerate them here.]
<Q>How shall we answer to God and men,</Q>
says he,
<Q>if we do not make proper enquiry into the abuses of our times? Nothing grows to abuse, but this house hath power to treat of it. All men agree, that the duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> is the cause of all the evil,</Q>
&amp;c. The slavish speaker, who had stolen to the king (which was what he meant by asking to go out for half an hour) returned, and brought a message from the king, adjourning the house, and all committees, till next morning <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. VIII, 191, 192, 196.</NOTE>. The speaker, by the king's command, adds, That he did not mean to <HI>restrain</HI> them in their just privileges; but only, that they should avoid reflections [no matter how <HI>just</HI>] on him|self and his ministers <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 197.</NOTE>. What would have been ac|cording
<PB N="9" REF="013851_0540_0F9E299C656CBFE0">
to this monarch's idea, <HI>restraining,</HI> if it was not restraining, to stop the commons from enquiring into the conduct of bad ministers? A power, which, as Sir <HI>Edw. Coke</HI> shews, had been so <HI>constantly</HI> assumed by parliament. Which shews the common apology for <HI>Charles</HI> I. <HI>viz.</HI> That he did not <HI>abridge</HI> liberty; but only refused to grant <HI>new</HI> privileges; to be greatly too indulgent to the violences of that des|perate tyrant.</P>
<P>The commons instructed their speaker to answer to one of his threatening messages, That it is the ancient right of parliament to debate in their own method, without interruption from the soveraine. That it is their ancient custom to consider of grievances fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st, and supplies afterwards. That they thought it abso|lutely necessary to join with the supplies a due care of the essentials of liberty, without which there is no government, nor any thing great or valuable that can be done either in peace or war <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. VII.441.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In one of their remonstrances to the king, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1626, they express themselves in these words:&mdash;
<Q>Your faithful commons, who <HI>can</HI> have no private end, no object but your majesty's service, and the good of our country <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. VI.467.</NOTE>.</Q>
[Had there been in that house of commons two or three hundred placemen, they would not have dared to say,
<Q>We <HI>can</HI> have no private end.</Q>]
<Q>It hath been the ancient, constant, and undoubted right and usage of parliaments to question, and com|plain of all persons, of what degree soever, who have been found grievances to the commonwealth in abusing the power committed to them by their sove|raine&mdash;without which liberty in parliament, the
<PB N="10" REF="013851_0541_0F9E299CD5CC9100">
commonwealth <HI>might</HI> languish under the pressure [of those grievances] without redress.</Q></P>
<P>The intractableness of his parliaments (an honest parliament will always be intractable, because a court will always be making exorbitant demands) made him determine to govern without them. When he could no longer put it off, he called one; but, says <HI>Voltaire</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Volt.</HI> ESS. SUR L'HIST. IV.147.</NOTE>,
<Q>C'etait assembler des citoyens irritez;</Q>
this was calling together a set of enraged subjects, and giving them an opportunity of consulting about the destruc|tion of his tyranny. For the court had not then, as now, millions to dole away, by which to put a grum|bling house of commons in good humour.</P>
<P>The fashion was not in those days, as we have seen it since, to stifle all enquiries into the disposal of the public money. Therefore it was
<Q>ordered, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1648, by the house of commons, That the com|mittee of <HI>Goldsmith's Hall</HI> do print all their receipts for compositions, and how the moneys have been disbursed, that aspersions upon parliament may be cleared <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitel.</HI> MEM. 308.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In those tyrannical times, the <HI>instruments</HI> of the tyranny were the grandees of the court, who were gainers by it; and the <HI>vindicators</HI> of the public liberty were the <HI>commons</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> who had no share in the spoils, but were losers, and had nothing to make up their losses. Had the commons of those days had a fellow-feeling with the court; had there been two or three hundred placemen in the house of commons, would they have stood up so boldly for the interest of their country? It was the court that imposed ship-money, that condemned <HI>Prynne, Bastwick, Burton,
<PB N="11" REF="013851_0542_0F9E299D977C5828">
Leighton,</HI> &amp;c. It was the brave commons that reversed the cruel sentences, and cast their enemies in damages for unjust imprisonment, tyrannical seizure of papers, exorbitant fines, cruel pilloryings and mutilations, star-chamber, court of <HI>York,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>Resolved, (<HI>A D&punc;</HI> 1647) That no member shall receive any profit of any office, grant, or sequestra|tion from parliament: That whatever any members have received shall be repaid for public use, and the estates of members liable for their debts <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. XV.422.</NOTE>.</Q>
A day was appointed for hearing complaints against members, and no member to receive any reparation for losses, till the public debts be paid. [Our gamblers are wallow|ing in the public money, while the nation is in debt 130 millions.] And tho' the self-denying ordinance was not strictly kept; (for <HI>Ireton, Fleetwood, Harris,</HI> and others, were elected into the house) a few cor|rupt men could carry no point; and the ordinance itself shews the sense of the times, and of all times, and all men, who pretend to have any regard for their country, concerning <HI>placemen</HI> in the <HI>house.</HI> And the many regulations made since for the pretended pur|pose of making parliament free, though ineffectual, and perhaps not always intended to be effectual, yet have a decent appearance, as coinciding with the gene|ral sense of mankind on this point.</P>
<P>The commons under <HI>Ch.</HI> I. were almost always unanimous. No wonder: they had no indirect in|terest to divide them; no places, no pensions, &amp;c. to put them upon opposing what was plainly for the public good. Therefore we do not find in those times any abandoned speechifiers in the house, like our <HI>Walpoles</HI> and our <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lhams,</HI> supporting the useful|ness
<PB N="12" REF="013851_0543_0F9E299E6F71E790">
of court-influence in parliament, in direct opposi|tion to common sense and common decency.</P>
<P><Q>Resolved, (<HI>A. D.</HI> 1640) That no monopolist or patentee shall sit in the house.</Q>
Many were expelled, and new writs issued <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. IX.148.</NOTE>. Parliament, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1645, pub|lishes a declaration,

<P>Sir <HI>Harbottle Grimstone</HI> thus describes a parliament answering the design and exhibiting the true spirit of a parliament.
<Q>Of such awful <HI>predominancy</HI> is the
<PB N="13" REF="013851_0544_0F9E299F1045AA28">
very name of a parliament to the nation, that it strikes with terror and despair all <HI>evil doers,</HI> and enriches and <HI>comforts</HI> the spirits of many groaning under the bur|den of oppression, inflicted on them unjustly and maliciously by unmerciful and wicked men, who have usurped to themselves places and offices of power and authority in church and state. It is not only the powerfullest of all courts, but the <HI>wisest</HI>; made and compacted not only of men found in <HI>religion,</HI> and well <HI>learned,</HI> but <HI>ripe</HI> in their judg|ments, selected from all parts of the kingdom, chosen with the <HI>free</HI> consent of the <HI>whole</HI> body politic of the kingdom.</Q>
[A man must be out of his wits to describe parliaments in our times in this manner.]
<Q>This great and high council is not only of such power and wisdom, but endowed with the greatest privileges, that not only the meanest of his majesty's subjects, but the greatest persons of the kingdom are in danger, if infringers of the same, to be called in question, and punished.</Q>
<HI>Crimstone</HI>'s speech on occasion of <HI>Charles</HI>'s demanding the five members <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. X.180.</NOTE>. He then mentions the privileges of parliament: viz.

or prosecuting delinquents.</Q>
To <HI>Grimstone</HI>'s speech may be added the answer of the commons in their declaration, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1642. The king pretended, that the measures he pursued, were more for the good of the kingdom, than those, which they proposed, on which account he rejected all their wise and pacific proposals, and was not to be satisfied, 'till he made his country a sea of blood.</P>

[no member had then any idea of indemnifying himself, by a place, or a pension, of the burden he brought upon his country by voting according to the minis|ter's direction]
<Q>should wholly cast off all care of the public good, and the king only take it up?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Heretofore, says Mr. <HI>Holles,</HI> in his speech before the lords, <HI>A.

present temper of the <HI>people</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, I.264.</NOTE>,</Q>
Those times differed from ours (the present always excepted) for we have seen the times, when the true account of the matter would have been, that parliament is what the <HI>court (not</HI> the <HI>people)</HI> would have it to be.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Holles</HI> impeached the nine peers before the lords <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. XI.200.</NOTE>, in his speech he shewed the importance of parliaments, and that the enemies of the public tranquillity, have always sought the destruction or diminution of the power of parliaments.
<Q>Parlia|ment, says he, is the foundation of government; it creates and perserves law; watches over religion</Q>
[the members in those days had some religion,]
<Q>pre|vents licentiousness of manners; preserves the rights and liberties of the subject; provides for common ne|cessities; prevents public fears; the kingdom can rest on no other foundation, than that of parliament.</Q></P>
<P>It is remarkable, that, when he mentions the arts of enemies for defeating the use of parliaments, as refusing to call them, diverting, obstructing, interrupting, or abruptly dissolving them; he never mentions corrupt|ing them by places, pensions, &amp;c. the most effectual of all means for destroying their usefulness. What had been done in that way before those times, had answered little purpose. <HI>Ch.</HI> IId's pension parlia|ment was the first successful experiment of that black art, so fatally improved since. When <HI>Ch.</HI> I. (says lord <HI>Lyttelton,</HI> in his speech on the <HI>Spanish</HI> convention <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. XI&punc;312.</NOTE>)
<Q>told the commons, who were prepar|ing complaints against <HI>Buckingham,</HI> that he would not allow any of his servants to be questioned in
<PB N="16" REF="013851_0547_0F9E29A5E0DE69D8">
parliament, he spoke the language of despotic power, and such as this house would never endure. But if instead of speaking so openly, he had a little softned his style; confessed their right to question his ser|vants, but at the same time denied them the means: if <HI>Buckingham</HI> himself had challenged them to exa|mine his conduct, or the conduct of those who acted by his instructions and under his orders; and then refused them the sight of these instructions, and the regular methods according to the usage of parlia|ment of examining into these orders; the appearance indeed would have been fairer, but the proceeding itself would have been equally dangerous, equally fatal to the rights of this house. Sir, that parlia|ment would not have borne it; for it was composed of such men as had no influence upon them to abate the spirit and zeal with which they proceeded to en|quire into and punish mal-administration: such men at their first meeting, before they would give one penny of money to support the king in a war with <HI>Spain</HI> which had been begun at the desire of par|liament, appointed a committee to consider of secret affairs, and another for grievances. They resolved to enquire into the misemployment of the public treasure, and dishonour brought upon the nation, before they voted any supply, without apprehending any reproach of want of zeal for the king or the war; but that they might know the true state of the nation, and carry on the war with more chearful|ness when justice was done upon those who had involved them in so many difficulties, the same parlia|ment declared, and it stands uncontroverted yet upon your journals, That common fame is a good ground of proceeding for this house either by enquiry, or if the
<PB N="17" REF="013851_0548_0F9E29A69121ECE0">
house find cause, by impeachment. Accordingly queries were drawn up to enquire into the conduct of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> which were afterwards turned into articles of impeachment against him; and the king to save his minister had no other way than dissolving that parliament; for the art of softening them by corruption was not in use in those days. Sir, I hope I have not mispent your time in calling back to your memory the proceedings of a former house of commons which deserve, I think, the greatest re|spect, and are mentioned with reverence by the most impartial historians. How history will mention ours, I wish we may think worth our concern; but how the nation will judge of them now, I am sure we ought to consider. Sir, if a king has lost the esteem and the hearts of his people, the interposition of par|liament may awaken him to a sense of his error, and by healing counsels reconcile and restore them again; but if parliaments themselves act so as to lose their own dignity and by consequence the esteem and love of the people, who shall then interpose or what mediator is left? It is such an evil as admits of no remedy: it is the worst misfortune that can ever befal a free government. To have approved the convention, to have rejected a motion for laying before parliament the instructions of the minister who concluded and signed that convention, and then to deny the means of examining into these negotia|tions upon which <HI>Spain</HI> grounds these very preten|sions, which we are now fighting to destroy&mdash;these measures will certainly do us great honour in the opinion of those who are this year to pay four millions for supporting the war. What they will think of all this I do not know; but I am apt to
<PB N="18" REF="013851_0549_0F9E29A751E5B5F8">
believe they will never think about it, without hav|ing at the same time in their thoughts that the same house of commons has three times rejected the place bill.</Q></P>
<P>In the short, the too short period of the republic (for how happy had it been for <HI>England</HI> if she had been governed by the republican parliament during the period of her disgraces under <HI>Charles</HI> II. and <HI>Iames</HI> II.) in that short period we see what may be expected from a set of un-bribed, un-biassed men assembled together to consult for the public good, without fears, and without hopes, from a bribing court, and free from the imcumbrances of such kings, or houses of peers, to negative, or at least to entangle and impede their measures for the general advantage. How unfriendly to liberty kings and lords have been, will too plainly appear on perusing the articles <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Lords</HI> in the sequel. I write in this seemingly republican strain, not that I have the least thought of suggesting the necessity, or propriety, of changing the form of govern|ment in <HI>Britain,</HI> from regal to republican, though the latter is undoubtedly preferable to the former, suppos|ing a state to be <HI>settling</HI> its form of government; but to caution kings and lords, not to bring on, as they have formerly done by their misbehaviour, their own exclusion. But let us hear our incomparable female historian.</P>
<P><Q>On the subject of the glory acquired by the <HI>English</HI> republic in this infant state, we shall observe the fol|lowing incautious testimonies of its inveterate ene|mies.</Q> <HI>Heath,</HI> on entering into the subject of the parliament's forced dissolution, and the ruin of the republic, breaks out in the following exclama|tion.
<Q>Now to the reproach of Fortune and her
<PB N="19" REF="013851_0550_0F9E29A813728FB8">
glorious pageant of an <HI>English</HI> commonwealth, which she had set up for another wonder of the world, to brave the pyramids of stone, and colossus of brass, as to the defiance of time's injury, having subdued all likelihood of danger from without; all princes being ready to entertain their friendship.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Clarendon,</HI> who with a heart replete with selfish malice, in prospective saw and sighed over the future grandeur of his country, on speaking of the political conduct of cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> makes the following observation:
<Q>After the battle of <HI>Naseby</HI> was lost, and the king seemed so totally defeated, that he had very little hope of appearing at the head of an army which might be able to resist the enemy, the cardinal was awakened to new apprehensions, and saw more cause to fear the monstrous power of the parliament, after they had totally subdued the king, than ever he had to apprehend the excess of greatness in the crown.</Q>
Treating of the <HI>Dutch</HI> war he observes:
<Q>The United Provinces now discerned, that they had helped to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ise an enemy which was too powerful for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, and which would not be treated as the crown had been.</Q>
<HI>Guthrie,</HI> an historian of monarchical principle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> makes the fol|lowing observation:
<Q><HI>Mazarine</HI> imagined, and that not without good grounds, that the natural interest of <HI>France</HI> led her to wish <HI>Cromwell</HI> to be at the head of the <HI>English,</HI> rather than it should be formed into a republic of brave and wise patriots.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On this act of violence,</Q>
[<HI>Cromwell</HI>'s turning out the republican parliament]
<Q><HI>Coke</HI> (an enemy) ex|claims,
<Q>Thus fell the victorious parliament, whose mighty actions will scarcely find belief in future generations; and to say the truth, they were a set of
<PB N="20" REF="013851_0551_0F9E29A919EB9AD8">
men most indefatigable and industrious in business, always seeking for men fit for it, and never prefer|ring any from favour and importunity. As they ex|celled thus in civil affairs, so it must be owned they exercised in matters ecclesiastic no such severity as others before them, upon such as dissented from them.</Q>
<HI>Guthrie,</HI> an anti-republican, expresses the following favourable opinion of this parliament:
<Q>The <HI>English</HI> republicans by their vigor and spirit, struck <HI>Europe</HI> with consternation; and the <HI>English</HI> flag was such a protection to commerce, that the trade of the world seemed now to center in <HI>Europe.</HI> Had this vast expence been drained from the sweat of the people, the furnishing it would not have so much alarmed the <HI>Dutch:</HI> but there had been a great reduc|tion in taxes, the customs alone furnished 250,000 <HI>l.</HI> clear of all deductions; the people scarce felt their burthens; and even the greatest enemies the government had, were pleased with the figure which <HI>England</HI> made abroad. Historians in general, esti|mating things by events and prejudices, have repre|sented the late parliament in a pitiful light, despised and disregarded by the people, which gave <HI>Cromwell</HI> the boldness to act as he did. But the reverse of this is true; for <HI>Cromwell</HI> dissolved them because he knew they must in time win upon the people; that the spirit with which they proceeded would soon render him and his army useless; and that they were pointing towards an establishment which must check the carreer of all inordinate ambition.</Q>
<Q>This parliament (says <HI>Trenchard,</HI> in the History of standing armies in <HI>England</HI>) made their name famous through the whole earth, conquered their enemies in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>; reduced the kingdom of <HI>Portu|gal</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="013851_0552_0F9E29A997CD5E58">
to their own terms, recovered our reputation at sea, overcame the <HI>Dutch</HI> in several famous battles; secured our trade, and managed the public expences with so much frugality, that no estates were gained by private men upon the public miseries, and at last were passing an act for their own dissolution and settling the nation in a free and impartial common|wealth.</Q>
<HI>Ludlow</HI> on the praises of this renowned assembly writes.
<Q>It will appear to unprejudiced posterity that they were a disinterested and impartial parliament, who though they had the sovereign power of the three nations in their hands for the space of ten or twelve years, yet did not in all that time give away amongst themselves so much as they spent for the public in three months.</Q>
In a <HI>Discourse of the national excellency of England,</HI> here is the following honourable character given of the <HI>English</HI> government during the short time it remained a republic.
<Q>If you respect its infancy and beginning, it out went in warlike atchievement all other common-wealths. I lay before me the exploits of <HI>Sparta, Athens, Car|thage,</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI>; and know that the <HI>Venetians Switzers,</HI> and <HI>United Provinces</HI> at this day, being contemptible for territory, are those only that appear fittest matches for the greatest empires. I know also, that <HI>Rome,</HI> the only mistress of the world, was justly celebrated for large conquests; and yet none of these states gave such starts, and made such acquests at their rise as our <HI>English</HI> common-wealth. Certainly so many advantages conduced to its great|ness and increase, and at its first appearing so large were its territories, that it may well be affirmed, never was a common-wealth in that respect laid on so large a foundation; and if in our conceit we should give it an answerable growth, we could not assign it
<PB N="22" REF="013851_0553_0F9E29AF382C8228">
less than the whole globe at last for its portion. At first, if you will judge by the affections of the people, it had not the hundredth part of <HI>England</HI> itself, and was to go through difficulties which would have con|founded any but a free state; yet how quickly had it brought the nation to somewhat a better understand|ing and a fair way of settlement: so that there are some who question whether any natural prince of <HI>England</HI> had ever been assisted on any occasion with such great forces so suddenly and with such alacrity raised, as they were at <HI>Worcester</HI>; and on the other side, how few went over to the king of <HI>Scots,</HI> though generally looked on as a rightful prince, deserves consideration. It lived not out a lustre; yet con|quered <HI>Scotland,</HI> (introducing more liberty and greater privileges than they had before) <HI>Ireland,</HI> and several other smaller islands; made other nations feel its force, as the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Portuguese</HI>; and was going on in such a carreer of action as was not to be stopped by human power. This government began a war with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which it would have ended with absolute conquest, or fallen in the attempt; and after this pro|bably, it would have entered on more honourable enterprizes, and not suffered the nation to grow effe|minate by ease and vice. In a word, it had brought in an instant the nation to a full glory, and such a splendour as cast a darkness, as it is affirmed by some, on the greatest actions of former times. This is certain, that the neighbouring states trembled at its sudden and prodigious greatness, and remote poten|tates did court and seek a good understanding from its hands; and its dissolution brought no ordinary content to those who had cause to fear it.</Q>
<Q>The agent from the <HI>Stewarts</HI> (as a late writer reports) at
<PB N="23" REF="013851_0554_0F9E29B0A34098E0">
the first appearance of this commonwealth urged the United Provinces, that if <HI>England</HI> were free, it would be formidable to them not only by interrupting their fishing, and all other maritime advantages, but by robbing them of traffic, as they had done the <HI>Venetians</HI>; and not only so, but give law to all <HI>Christendom</HI> by reason of the commodiousness of its harbours and the number of its ships.</Q>
To the just and high elogiums which have been made on the government of the par|liament it is to be remembered, that to them is due the singular praise of having pursued the true interest of their country, in attending particularly to its ma|ritime strength, and carrying on its foreign wars by its naval powers. This example, which raised <HI>Eng|land</HI> to so great an height of glory and prosperity, has never yet been followed, and in all probability never will, by the succeeding monarchs. The aim of princes is to make conquests on their subjects, not to enlarge the empire of a free people. A standing army is a never-failing instrument of domestic tri|umph; and it is very doubtful whether a naval force could be rendered useful in any capacity, but that of extending the power and prosperity of the coun|try <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Macaul.</HI> HIST.

(says a writer in STATE TRACTS, time of king <HI>William</HI>)
<Q>even in the midst of domestic discontents, and beset on all sides with foreign assaults, and invasions at home; if that small and broken number without any head, and under so many disadvantages, could by this only means secure our peace, and so widely extend the repute and honour of the <HI>English</HI> name; what country or what region could ever give limits to the un|bounded

reputation of a full and legal parliament so nobly qualified? What nation could there be so powerful as to resist our forces, or so politick as to infatuate our counsels? There is nothing within the compass of human wishes of which we might not assure ourselves, from the wisdom and virtue of such a disinterested assembly <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">STATE TRACTS, time of king <HI>William,</HI> II.644.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Fairfax</HI>'s plan shews what an idea people had in those times, (<HI>viz.</HI> before parliamentary corruption prevailed) of the safety of confiding in them. He proposes that the two houses have the supreme judg|ment of offenders, with power of exposition and application of law without appeal. No state-criminal to be pardonable by the king, without their consent. The house of peers no longer to be alone the supreme court, grand juries to be nominated, not by the under-sheriff, but by the people of the counties mutually. Militia to be under power of parliament for ten years, and not under the king <HI>alone.</HI> The public treasure the same. Regulations for the militia or army to be made in parliament. Great offices of state to be dis|posed of by parliament for ten years. Afterwards parliament to give in to the king three names, and he to appoint one. No new-made peer to sit without leave of parliament. All declarations against parlia|ment to be void. In modern times, it is altogether the same to the people, whether the command of the army, treasury, state-offices&punc; &amp;c. be in the court, the lords, or the commons. For these three are one.</P>
<P>When a reward was proposed for Mrs. <HI>Lane,</HI> for saving that blessed saint <HI>Charles</HI> II. some of the mem|bers said, the house had no right to give away in this manner the people's money to any but the king for
<PB N="25" REF="013851_0556_0F9E29B1E5AADE38">
public use <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. XXIII.59.</NOTE>. On the contrary, in modern times we see our parliaments so motherly to our ministers, they know not how to refuse them any thing they ask; at one time our kings are to have their civil list (for|merly granted annually) settled on them for life; at another 500,000<HI>l.</HI> voted to pay the civil list debts; at another an account of 250,000<HI>l.</HI> of 60,000<HI>l.</HI> of 35,000<HI>l.</HI> passed unexamined, because the court gave their word of honour the money was all spent in the public service; of which more elsewhere.</P>
<P><HI>Clarendon</HI> says, <HI>Charles</HI> II. despaired of his restoration, when he heard of the resurrection of parliament after <HI>Richard Cromwell</HI>'s resignation. An incorrupt par|liament is never very courtly, and contrariwise, a corrupt one can deny nothing to kings and courts. But if <HI>Charles</HI> had recollected, that his friend <HI>Monk</HI> had an army at his command, he would not have despaired. Armies and kings have a great tenderness for one an|other, and are particularly useful to one another. Both depend more upon <HI>power,</HI> than upon <HI>justice</HI>; both love to rule without <HI>controul</HI>; kings love armies, because an army can <HI>support</HI> them in tyrannical measures without the trouble of <HI>satisfying</HI> the subjects; and armies love kings, because they are <HI>indulged</HI> by kings (on account of their usefulness) in a different manner from what they experience under republican government. But of this I shall have occasion to treat fully in the article <HI>Army.</HI></P>
<P><Q>There is nothing of greater importance to the safety and good of the kingdom, (says Mr. <HI>Pymme, A. D.</HI> 1641) than that this high court of parlia|ment, which is the fountain of justice and govern|ment, should be kept pure, uncorrupt, and free from

partiality and bye respects. This would not only add lustre and reputation, but strength and authority to all our acts. In this the lords are specially inte|rested, as being a third estate by inheritance and birth-right.

Our constitution seems to have pro|vided for it by never suffering the king (till <HI>Charles</HI> Ist's reign) to have a mercenary army to frighten them into a compliance, nor places nor revenues great enough to bribe them into it. The places in the king's gift were but few, and most of them patent places for life, and the rest great offices of state enjoyed by single persons, which seldom sell to the share of the commons, such as the office of a lord chancellor, lord treasurer, privy seal, lord high admiral, &amp;c. and when these office<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were possessed by the lords, the commons were severe inquisitors into their actions. Thus the government of <HI>England</HI> continued from the time that the <HI>Romans</HI> quitted the island to the time of <HI>Ch.</HI> I. who was the first I have read of that made an opposition to him|self in the house of commons the road to preferment, of which the earls of <HI>Strafford</HI> and <HI>Noy</HI> were the most remarkable instances; who from great patriots became the chief assertors of despotick power. But this served only to exasperate the rest; for he had not places enough for all that expected them, nor money enough to bribe them. It is true, he raised great sums of money upon the people; but it being without authority of parliament, and having no army to back him, it met with such difficulties in the raising, that it did him but little good, and ended at last in his ruin; though by the means of a long and miserable war which brought us from one tyranny to another: for the army had got all things into their power, and governed the nation by a council of war, which made all parties join in calling in <HI>Ch.</HI> II. so that he came in with the general applause of the people, who in a kind fit gave him a vast revenue for life. By this he was enabled to raise an army,
<PB N="29" REF="013851_0560_0F9E29B863FC0170">
and bribe the parliament, which he did to the pur|pose: but being a luxurious prince, he could not part with great sums at once. He only fed them from hand to mouth: so that they found it necessary to keep him in a constant dependance upon them, as they were upon him. They knew he would give them ready money no longer than he had an absolute necessity for them, and that he had not places enough in his disposal to secure a majority in the house: for in those early days the art was not found out of splitting and multiplying places; as instead of a lord treasurer, to have five lords of the treasury; instead of a lord admiral, to have seven lords of the admi|ralty; to have seven commissioners of the customs; nine of the excise; fourteen of the navy-office; ten of the stamp-office; eight of the prize-office; six|teen commissioners of trade; two of the post-office; four of the transports; four for hackney-coaches; four for wine-licences; four for the victualling-office, and multitudes of other offices which are endless to enumerate. I believe the gentlemen, who have the good fortune to be in some of those em|ployments, will think I compliment them, if I say, they have not been better executed since they were in so many hands than when in fewer: and I must confess, I see no reason why they may not be made twice as many, and so on <HI>ad infinitum</HI> (unless the number be ascertained by parliament) and what danger this may be to our constitution I think of with horror.

<P>It is remarkable, how directly in the teeth of the court, the commons often proceeded in former incor|rupt, or less corrupt, times. In former times the court and commons were generally opposite; in ours the constituents and representatives. There was much corruption in king <HI>William</HI>'s time; but we sometimes see the stream of parliamentary proceedings in those days run very clear. King <HI>William</HI> had given away immense grants of forfeited estates in <HI>Ireland.</HI> The commons resolved, <HI>A.

<Q>applying all the forfeited estates and interests in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to the use of the public, and that a judi|catory

The courtiers in the house moved, That some part of the forfeited estates might be left in the king's disposal. It passed in the negative; and they made a resolution condemning the advising and procuring those grants to be passed <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. III.123.</NOTE>. The commons addressed the king on these resolutions. The king answered, that his intention in giving those grants was to reward those, who had behaved well, particu|larly in the reduction of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which he thought himself in justice obliged to do. The uncourtly commons thought he was more justly bound to pay the just debts contracted in the late war; and they thought the forfeited estates a very proper fund for the purpose. How did the <HI>Romans,</HI> in their best times, reward their heroes? With a wisp of hay round their heads, or a ride through the town, and up to the capitol. The commons, provoked at this answer, resolved, That whoever advised it, intended to create a misunderstanding between the king and people <NOTE N="b." PLACE="foot">Ibid. 124.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All the proceedings were ordered to be printed, and it was resolved,

Those brave men were jealous even of our great deliverer, and would not bear mis-govern|ment even by him. The lords (generally on the wrong side) oppose these brave and wise measures. Conferences followed, and warm disputes between the houses. At last the good king desires the lords to yield the point. Lord <HI>Sommers</HI> was found to be at the bottom of all this opposition. The commons put
<PB N="32" REF="013851_0563_0F9E29BADE684188">
the question, that the king be desired to remove him. This was not carried; but a resolution was made, that no foreigner (except the prince of <HI>Denmark</HI>) be admitted to his majesty's counsels in <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Ireland.</HI> The king, to avoid this address, prorogues, and afterwards dissolves the parliament.</P>
<P>The commons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1700, went upon a scheme for applying the value of forfeited estates, granted away since 1688, to the payment of the public debts. The value of them was thought to be almost two millions. The commons resolve, That these grants were against the king's honour and the public good. This resolution was presented to the king in form of an address; to which the king gives an answer, justi|fying the grants, as given to deserving persons. The commons, enraged, make a resolution against the king's advisers. They proceeded to a bill of resump|tion. Thirteen trustees are appointed to hear claims, &amp;c. None to be trusted, who had any dependence on the king. An address proposed to the king that he would remove lord <HI>Sommers</HI> from his councils and presence, because he had opposed the bill of resump|tion. The king, provoked, wants to overset the bill. But many of the king's friends were for passing it to prevent mischief, the commons being set upon it. The commons in those days were too mighty for the court. It is true, that, according to <HI>Tindal</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">CONTIN.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Placemen and Pensioners unfit for Members of Par|liament, because not likely to be uninfluenced.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the oldest, if not absolutely the oldest, writer in the world, threatens
<Q>a fire to consume the tabernacles of bribery<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">JOB XV.34.</NOTE>.</Q>
A parliament filled with placemen and pensioners is literally a tabernacle of bribery. For it is impossible to give an <HI>honest</HI> reason for any number of placemen's or pensioners having <HI>suffrage</HI> in parliament. The house of commons ought to be the <HI>people</HI> in one room. And why must the people be bribed to consult their own interest? If indeed the
<PB N="38" REF="013851_0569_0F9E29C39A364FD8">
<HI>court</HI> has schemes to carry, directly opposite to the people's interest, it may be convenient for the <HI>court,</HI> that many placemen croud the house of commons.</P>
<P>It is not easy to imagine, even stretching charity till it cracks, that any one ever seriously thought the admission of place-men, pensioners, and officers, into the house of commons, safe, or decent; that any man of common sense can think of it otherwise, than as an open and impudent defiance of the sense of the whole independent people of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Our court advocates, however, sometimes divert themselves (on a too fatally serious subject) by treat|ing the independent people like children, when they tell us, it is good policy to drop some douceurs among the members of both houses, to <HI>attach</HI> them more closely to their <HI>country</HI>'s good. As if it were necessary to bribe mankind to consult their <HI>own</HI> in|terest. Take away your douceurs, and <HI>every mem|ber</HI>'s interest will be the same with the <HI>public.</HI> Suppose I give out, that I will not eat, or drink, unless the court bribes me. Would the court think it necessary to settle an annual pension on me, to make me eat a dinner every day? or would it be thought proper to give me a place&mdash;any where, but in Bed|lam? The court knows full well, that the direct contrary of their scandalous pretence is the truth; and that the members of the legislature would natu|rally consult but too well for their iniquitous purposes, their own interest, in consulting that of their country, did not they byass them by throwing <HI>another</HI> interest and advantage in their way; which for that reason they accordingly do, at an immense expence to the nation.</P>

<P>But as we know, the number of men capable of standing this fiery trial, is very small, we ought to be the more cautious of laying temptations in the way of those, whose failure is to be apprehended, and whose failure may be of such ruinous consequence to the public. To trust our all, without account, to a set of frail men, and then put those men in such circumstances as are likely to lead them to betray us&mdash;what can be imagined more contrary to wisdom? Several millions a year laid out in supporting the power of the court! And this not sufficient; of such a growing nature is corruption! Nothing of this boundless unaccountable waste could have place in a republic. I do not mention this as any reflection on our <HI>kings.</HI> It is but a small part of this immense sum, that is consumed by them in their <HI>propria persona,</HI> or that is laid out on their families. But in a republic, judge <HI>Blackstone</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">COMM. I.333.</NOTE> would not have written as follows;
<Q>It is impossible to sup|port that <HI>dignity,</HI> which a king of <HI>Great Britain</HI> should maintain, with an income in <HI>any degree less,</HI> than what is now established by parliament.</Q>
Ac|cording to the learned judge, whatever is, is right. But, surely, with all due submission, the <HI>dignity</HI> of a <HI>British</HI> monarch does not consist in his <HI>spending</HI> large sums of his poor people's money; but rather in his <HI>sparing</HI> their purses, and setting them an example of frugality. With the learned judge's good
<PB N="40" REF="013851_0571_0F9E29C492DC6A38">
leave, it is the dignity (if dignity it may be called) of the <HI>ministry,</HI> and their crew, much more than the king's, that devours the civil list. So that the plain <HI>English</HI> of what the learned judge has written, will be what follows;
<Q>It is impossible to support that <HI>influence</HI> which a <HI>British</HI> ministry <HI>should</HI> maintain, with an income in any degree less than several mil|lions <HI>per annum:</HI></Q>
Than which I cannot conceive a more ruinous political doctrine.</P>
<P>When Sir <HI>W. Temple</HI> dissuaded <HI>Ch.</HI> II. from all thoughts of making himself absolute, he observed to him, among other things, that it would be impracti|cable: for that <HI>England</HI> was quite a different sort of country from <HI>France,</HI> where absolute government was established. That in the land of slavery there was no such independent body as our middling gentry; and that, on the contrary, that country was full of priests, of needy noblesse, military officers, and revenue-men, all naturally devoted to the support of arbitrary power, as being all interested in it themselves; that <HI>Charles</HI> had but few places and pensions to give, and no army of considerable force <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hume,</HI> HIST. STUARTS, II.240.</NOTE>. [We have now innumerable places and pensions to allure, and a formidable army to threaten our members into court-measures.] Accord|ingly the pension parliament was very compliant to the court at first; but grew more patriotic afterwards, most probably disappointed in their voracious expec|tations.</P>
<P><HI>Ch.</HI> I. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1628, gave out, that it belongs only to the judges to declare the meaning of the laws <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rapin,</HI> II.276.</NOTE>. But <HI>Rapin</HI> justly remarks, That this was making those men the interpreters of the laws, who depended

on him; for the king could then make or unmake the judges, as he pleased; which was throwing the liberties, properties, and lives of the subjects into the hands of the king or ministry. Is not the reasoning the same with regard to membe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> parliament? If they hold places, and expect preferments from the ministry, are they not the dependents on the ministry as much as <HI>Charles</HI>'s judges were on him? And is it not as much to be expected, that they should be slaves to the ministry?</P>
<P><HI>Whitelocke,</HI> in opposing the self-denying ordinance, observes, That the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> gave the greatest employments to their senators. But there is always a great difference between a monarchy and a republic. The latter has checks for overgrown power, which the former knows nothing of. And it is the peculiar evil of monarchy, that ministers screen themselves behind the throne; and, as kings are sacred characters, as our kings can do no evil, and parliaments are bribed, ministerial crimes go unpunished. Again; <HI>Whitelocke</HI> says, the <HI>English</HI> have always given great places to the members of both houses. But in those times, the number of places was so small, they could seldom produce any great effect. Accordingly we see how staunch parliaments were in <HI>Ch.</HI> Ist's time.</P>
<P>The proposals for more effectually putting the self-denying ordinance in force <HI>A. D.</HI> 1648, were at that time over-ruled, because many of the members held very profitable places. Yet it is certain there were not in those days places for a majority of the house, and all depends on the majority <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. XVII.386.</NOTE>. How then came the minority to gain such a point?</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="013851_0573_0F9E29C6896F8318">This shews, that the <HI>effect</HI> of places and pensions given to parliament-men extends much wider than the places and pensions themselves reach to.

<P>The author of <HI>Faction detected by Facts,</HI> says, a pension-bill is impossible, because members may take the money, and conceal their crime.

The dependence of the legislature on the execu|tive power hath been contended for by the same persons, under the same direction, and yet nothing surely can be more evident than this; that in a constitution like ours, the safety of the whole depends upon the ballance of the parts, and the ballance of the parts on their mutual independency on one another; agreeably to which, <HI>Thuanus</HI> makes <HI>Ferdinand</HI> say in answer to the <HI>Castilians,</HI> who press'd him to take away the independency of the

<P><Q>It is pleasant to observe a set of writers charging others with forming republican schemes, when they themselves are the persons who in effect, and by the necessary consequence of their way of reasoning, have been placing our excellent constitution in a most ridiculous and contemptible light. According to them it is no better than a jum|ble of incompatible powers, which would separate and fall to pieces of themselves, unless restrained and upheld by such honourable methods as those of bribery and corruption; for how is it possible for any man under any other notion, to plead for the necessity or for the fitness of places and pensi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, or any pecu|niary influence among the members of the house of commons? If any dependence or biass created by such motives were really necessary, it would prove that the form of our government itself was defective to a degree of ridiculousness; that it was a constitu|tion having a representative of the people which must be engaged not to represent them, nor to vote and act if uninfluenced by private interest or corrupt motives. Now if such an influence or dependence was univer|sal and unlimited throughout the whole house, the monarchy would be absolute; and whenever this in|fluence prevails in any degree, it tends to arbitrary power. For this reason the true friends of liberty must perpetually guard against such influences, which

<P>That placemen in parliament, are in our times a serious evil, appears from this, that
<Q>the minister, before he introduces a bill, can foretell, almost with certainty, its fate in the house; and by means of the influence which he has over the members, can com|mand, in most cases, a majority of votes. Nor will this influence appear in the least surprizing, if we consider the great number of lucrative places which the sovereign, that is, the minister, has to dispose of. For though the property of the subjects be much larger than that of the sovereign, yet is the property of this last by no means inconsiderable; and it is well known, that much less property, in a single hand, will counterballance a greater in several hands. Ac|cording to the most exact computation, there are near three millions at the disposal of the crown. The civil list amounts to near a million, the collection of all taxes to another, and the employments in the army and navy, along with ecclesiastical prefer|ments, to above a third million: an enormous sum, and what cannot fail to attach to the court an im|mense number of dependants; and as few placemen are excluded from seats in parliament, the sovereign</Q>
[say rather the minister]
<Q>must have a mighty influ|ence upon all the deliberations of that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gust assem|bly. It ought also to be observed, that the great in|crease of our dominions, and the consequent necessity for the proportionable increase in our military esta|blishment,</Q>
[there is no need of a military establish|ment, a militia is every way preferable]
<Q>are both of them pernicious to liberty; for seldom or never has it
<PB N="48" REF="013851_0579_0F9E29CD92E1C168">
been known, that any nation has preserved its liberty, after having greatly extended its conquests, and still less after having established a large standing army. And though the increase of commerce, which is likewise the consequence of extensive dominions, be favoura|ble in some measure to the cause of liberty, by intro|ducing among the people a greater degree of equality, and by drawing them into large towns, which always breathe a republican spirit; yet does it also by this very circumstance of drawing them into large towns, tend evidently to corrupt their minds, and to enervate their bodies, and thus to prepare them for the recep|tion of that slavery, which a variety of other causes is likely to bring upon them. With regard to the people's jealousy of the crown, which is said to be inherent in the <HI>British</HI> constitution; this jealousy, however great, may yet by an artful minister be laid asleep. The power of the crown is certainly upon the increase, but it advances, at the same time, with such slow and imperceptible steps, as not to awaken the jealousy of the public; and before this jealousy be effec|tually awakened, the power of the crown may have be|come so great, as to be altogether irresistible. Every new tax that is imposed upon the people, every foot of ground that is added to our dominions, every increase that is made in our military establishment, all conspire by their united influence to increase the power of the crown; and if things be suffered to proceed in their pre|sent course, and no extraordinary convulsion happens in the state, the <HI>British</HI> liberties must at l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st be swallow|ed up in absolute monarchy.

<PB N="49" REF="013851_0580_0F9E29CE5292A380">
monarchy, but to an aristocracy; though this last will in all probability only pave the way for the introduction of monarchy. The very essence of our liberty consists in the people's having the right and the power to chuse their representatives in parlia|ment; that is in other words, in being their own legislators. But should we ever come to have a great number of hereditary legislators, or those who are such independent of the people's choice, and should these hereditary legislators be possessed of the whole, or of the greatest part of the national property, and should they, by means of that property, be able to influence the elections, and to controul the proceed|ings of the members of the lower house, though we may be still amused with the pleasing sound of liberty, and though the lower house may be permitted to sub|sist in its present form, the national liberties are from that moment ruined. For it is well known, that the forms of a constitution may long remain, after its spirit has been entirely extinguished. How far this is our case at present, or how far it is likely to be our case, in some not very distant period, any one may easily determine, by considering the great number of wealthy commoners, who within this half century past have been advanced to the peerage, and the spirit which still prevails of advancing others to the same dignity. The moment a commoner becomes trou|blesome in the lower house, if he is possessed of a competent fortune, he is immediately transplanted to the upper, where he at once strengthens the aristocra|tic, and proportionably weakens the democratic part of our government. And how great an influence the members of the upper, have upon the elections, and consequently upon the proceedings of those of the lower
<PB N="50" REF="013851_0581_0F9E29CF769999A0">
house, may be easily collected from perusing a court calendar, where we shall see, that almost all the noblemens sons in <HI>England,</HI> who are of a proper age, are members of the lower house, and that many commoners have obtained their seats there, by the in|terest and countenance of some powerful nobleman. In a word, we seem to be in a fair way of becoming in a short time, a nation of great lords, and of needy vassals; the consequence of which must infallibly be, that the people, harrassed by the oppressions of the great, conscious that their liberties are already ravish|ed from them, and chusing rather to submit to one mild master, than to two or three hundred petty ty|rants, will petition the sovereign, as the last favour he can grant them, that he will be graciously pleased to establish an absolute monarchy.

<Q>are, I am sure, all con|vinced, that the happiness, the essence of our consti|tution does not depend upon outward forms, but upon realities. Our constitution does not depend upon our having always a parliament; but upon that par|liament's being independent of the administration; upon its being in the power of parliament to examine severely, and judge impartially the conduct and the measures of those employed in the administration, to represent the grievances, and watch over the liberties and the properties of the people of this nation, and to take away evil counsellors from before the king. But if ever a majority of both houses of parliament should come to be composed of gentle|men whose daily bread, or at least their chief sup|port, depended entirely upon the favours of the crown, can it be imagined that it would then be in the power of parliament to examine freely, or judge impartially, the conduct of these favourites; to relieve the people from the oppressions brought upon them by such favourites; or to tell their sovereign any ungrateful truths about those whom he had thought fit to employ as his ministers? Would not
<PB N="61" REF="013851_0592_0F9E29000B84C2D0">
an arbitrary negative be then put upon all such ques|tions in parliament? Would not the best designs of the uncorrupted and independent few be baffled by a corrupt and slavish majority? And shall any question which tends towards the preventing such a misfor|tune, have now the ill fate to be rejected by your lordships?</Q></P>
<P>It is well remembered how much, and how justly, all ranks in the nation were pleased with the act made at the instance of the present king (whom God pre|serve!) <HI>A. D.</HI> 1762, for preventing the removal of the judges at the demise of every sovereign, which naturally tended to put them on courting the heir apparent, to the violation of justice in their sentences. But why were we pleased with this regulation? Ac|cording to the opposers of all schemes for restoring independency to parliament, there was no need of any such regulation. According to them, there is no corruption, no dependency, no need of any schemes for making either judges, or members of parliament independent.</P>
<P><Q>It would be ridiculous</Q>

If any thing like this should happen in the present debate, it may tend to dis|appoint the motion; but with all those who are neither placemen no pensioners, I am sure it ought to be an argument in its favour; and, I hope, it will prevail with some gentlemen, who in former ses|sions opposed this motion, to alter their sentiments and their way of voting upon this occasion, when they have such a plain proof before their eyes, that, if a place does not induce a man to vote against his honour and his conscience, it at least byasses his judgment, and makes him conclude that to be wrong, which he before thought and declared to be right.</Q></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Strange</HI>'s speech in answer to that of <HI>Edw. Walpole, A. D.</HI> 1742 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. XIV.41.</NOTE>, is close to our present purpose.
<Q>As we seem to improve every day in those doctrines that are introductory of arbitrary power, the doc|trine of corruption has this day been pushed farther than ever, I believe, it was in this house. It has been represented not only as a harmless, but a necessary implement of government; and all the laws we have for excluding pensioners, and several sorts of officers, from having seats in this house, may, by the same sort of reasoning, be proved to be subver|sive of our constitution, and introductory of anar|chy, confusion, and arbitrary power. If a gentle|man of a small estate, or an estate, however large,
<PB N="63" REF="013851_0594_0F9E2900D6448FC0">
that cannot supply the wants of his luxury or ava|rice, cannot be supposed capable of being induced by any mercenary motive the crown can throw in his way, to consent to grants or regulations, or to approve of measures that tend towards the intro|duction of arbitrary power, or that appear to be inconsistent with the public good; why should we exclude pensioners, why should we exclude the com|missioners and officers of our customs and excise, from having seats in this house? If the power of granting pecuniary and mercenary rewards to mem|bers be so necessary for the managing of this house, and for answering the necessary ends of government, why should we, in any respect, abridge that power, which if ever so extensive, can do us no harm, and which, if too much abridged, may overset both our government and constitution? Surely, no man of common sense would make the least approach towards a precipice, if he could keep his distance without the least danger or inconvenience; therefore, if we admit this doctrine, we must suppose those par|liaments void of common sense, in which the laws we now have for excluding pensioners, and several sorts of officers, were agreed to. But experience in all ages, and all countries, must convince us that this doctrine is false, deceitful, and pernicious. In all countries where arbitrary power has been, or is now set up, corruption was the footstool upon which it mounted into the throne. By corruption men are induced to arm their magistrates, or supreme magi|strate, with such powers, as will enable them to de|stroy first the essence, and afterwards the very face of public liberty.</Q></P>

<P><Q>Let us consider, Sir, in what liberty and pro|perty truly consists, and we shall see, that where any one man has in his power a large fund for cor|ruption, both may be absolutely destroyed, and an arbitrary power established before people become generally sensible of their danger. A man's per|sonal liberty consists in its not being in the power of any man, or magistrate, with impunity, to im|prison or kill him, or inflict any personal punish|ment upon him, unless he has been formally tried, and justly condemned by that method of trial, and by those laws, which have been established, and are approved of by the majority of the society to which he belongs. Property again consists in a man's being secure of enjoying, and transmitting to his posterity, what has been left to him by his ancestors, or acquired by his own industry, unless the whole, or some part of it, be taken from him, in pur|suance of laws that have been established, and are approved by the majority of the society to which he belongs. Whilst this is the case, every man of the society enjoys liberty and property in their full extent; and this will be our case as long as our
<PB N="65" REF="013851_0596_0F9E2902986233E8">
elections and parliaments remain free from any influ|ence either compulsive or corrupt. But, suppose, Sir, a majority of our house of commons consisted of such as held lucrative places from the crown, and suppose a judge were to be brought before them who for the sake of some corrupt consideration, had, at the desire of the crown, illegally and un|justly condemned and imprisoned many of his fel|low-subjects; would not the crown, I mean the ministers of the crown, endeavour to protect such a judge? Would not they give hints to their officers in this house, that a dismission would be the cer|tain consequence of their giving a vote against this tool? And can we suppose that many of these officers would chuse to lose a place of 500 <HI>l.</HI> or 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, rather than give a vote in favour of this judge? Sir, I have a very great opinion of our present judges, but, without any reflection upon them, I will say, that it is upon the independency and integrity of our parliaments that we must depend for the integrity and impartiality of our judges; for the crown has many ways to reward a pliable judge, and as many to punish an obstinate one. Nay, if parliaments were once become depen|dent upon the crown, an obstinate integrity would of itself be sufficient for getting a judge removed by the address of both houses of parliament; for if the majority of parliament were such as depended upon the crown for getting or holding some lucrative em|ployment, they would easily be persuaded that such judge had done injustice to the crown, or had fomented sedition by shewing favour to the seditious, and under this pretence they would vote for ad|dressing to remove him, without considering that they thereby established arbitrary power; and
<PB N="66" REF="013851_0597_0F9E2903682F1FE8">
made not only their own estates, but their lives and liberties dependent upon the arbitrary will of their sovereign; for by this precedent, all our judge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would be convinced, that they must take direction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the ministers of the crown in all prosecutions&punc; trials, and causes that might afterwards come before them; and what man could say he had any liberty or property left, if the ministers of the crown had it in their power to take his life, liberty, or estate from him, whenever they pleased, by a false accu|sation, and a mock trial? Even after such a fatal turn in our constitution, as long as a spirit of cor|ruption prevailed among the people, and the cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> kept within the bounds of common decency, there would be no occasion for any compulsive methods, either at elections, or in parliament, because the ministers would always find people enough, that would be ready to take their money or their favours, and in expectation or return would agree to vote <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> directed; but if by the ridiculous conduct of the court, a spirit of liberty should arise among the peo|ple, the violent and compulsive methods usual in such cases would be made use of.

our constitution. Ensnaring laws may be made, or the laws we have for securing our liberties may be repealed, or suspended under various pretences, without a corrupt man's being sensible that he is thereby exposing his own estate to the precarious tenure of arbitrary laws.

<P>Lord <HI>Strange</HI> then goes on to shew how, among other particulars, a designing ministry might gradually increase the army to such a pitch as would easily over|throw liberty.</P>
<P><Q>Can we suppose, says his lordship, that any man would risque his losing a lucrative employment by voting against a small augmentation of the army? This, Sir, must convince every true lover of liberty, how necessary it is, that no member of this assembly, or at least as few as possible, should be under such temptation. I shall grant, that in most points, which come to be debated before this house, some of our members may have a private interest in opposing, or agreeing; but as long as this private interest does not proceed from the favours they enjoy, or expect from the crown, it can never injure the public good; because if some have a private interest in opposing, others will have a pri|vate
<PB N="68" REF="013851_0599_0F9E290656A6C078">
interest in agreeing to what is proposed; and those whose private interest is no way concerned, will always cast the balance in favour of the public good. The granting of money is the only case where we can suppose the members generally engaged by their private interest, to oppose what is necessary for the public service; but this interest is so small, with regard to each particular member, that it can never be of any weight. This is demonstrated, Sir, from the whole course of our history, for I defy any man to give me one instance where the parliament denied granting what was necessary for the public service, unless they were denied justice with regard to the redress of grievances, or unless they had well grounded apprehensions that the money would be misapplied. But let us see, Sir, how this argument will stand upon the other side of the question. It is certain that the parliament ought never to grant more than is absolutely necessary for the public service. It is likewise certain, that we never ought to grant even what is necessary, till all grievances be redressed, and our former grants regularly and strictly accounted for. This is our duty as mem|bers of this house: but shall we perform this duty if a majority of us be greatly concerned in interest to neglect it? And this will always be the case if a majority of us hold or expect some lucrative office or employment at the pleasure of the crown, because it will always be the interest of ministers, and even their safety may sometimes be concerned in our not performing this duty. Suppose they ask from parliament 500,000 <HI>l.</HI> or a million for carrying on some whimsical, perhaps pernicious scheme of their own; will a member of this house, who is to pay for his share not above 50 <HI>l.</HI> of this sum, refuse
<PB N="69" REF="013851_0600_0F9E29076D072920">
granting it, when he is to get or hold 500<HI>l.</HI> or 1000<HI>l.</HI> a year, by consenting to the grant? Will a member of this house insist upon first redressing a grievance by which he suffers little, perhaps no sensible prejudice, when he is to get or hold 2 or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">00<HI>l.</HI> a year by letting it remain? And finally, Sir, will a member of this house call ministers to a strict account by which he can never expect to put a farthing in his own pocket, when by neglecting to do so, he may get or hold a good post or employ|ment, and perhaps procure a round sum, which he himself has purloined from the public. Sir, I was sorry to hear a young gentleman talk so much of mens private passions and affections, and of every man's having a view to the service of some favourite passion, in every vote he gives in parliament, or at elections. I hope the case is far otherwise; but if it is not, we ought to endeavour to make it so, by putting it out of the power (at least as far as we can, by such laws as this) of any man to serve him|self by his way of voting in parliament or at elec|tions, any further than may result to him from the general good of his country If we can do this; if we can put it out of the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er of the selfish and mercenary to sell their votes in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rliament, no man will purchase a seat there at any high price, and this will of course put an end to bribery and corruption at elections; for no mercenary soul will purchase what he cannot sell; and those who are prompted by their ambition to purchase, will never go to any high price, nor will they submit to be the slaves of a minister after they have purchased. Even ministers themselves would cease their bribery at elections, because they could not depend upon hav|ing their candidate's vote in parliament, if he had
<PB N="70" REF="013851_0601_0F9E2907934DF4A0">
no lucrative office depending upon his voting always with the minister; and if the flood-gates of the treasury were not opened at any election, I am con|vinced we should soon have little or no bribery in the kingdom. Whilst there are purchasers, Sir, there will be sellers; I am afraid there are at pre|sent too many of both: but if you can make it worth no man's while to purchase, you will put an end to the traffic; and this is the design of the bill now proposed. I have shewn, that if you do not agree to it, there will be, there must be, a cor|rupt dependency in parliament; that by such a dependency our constitution may be overturned, without any compulsive dependency: and that the latter may be made use of by an arbitrary govern|ment, and certainly will be made use of, as soon as it becomes necessary for the support of its arbi|trary power. Upon this side, Sir, the danger is certain and inevitable. Let us then consider the danger pretended to be on the other. If we exclude officers, or the greatest part of them, from having seats in this house, it is said, it will introduce anarchy and confusion, because it will be impossible to govern such a numerous assembly as this with|out a power in the crown to reward those who appear zealous in its service; and that as soon as this impossibility i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> perceived, all our officers, civil and military, will join with the crown in laying aside the use of parliaments. What the honourable gentleman may mean, Sir, by governing such a numerous assembly, I do not know; but according to the common acceptation of the word, I should be sorry to see it in the power of ministers to govern either house of parliament, by any other method than that of convincing the majority that nothing is
<PB N="71" REF="013851_0602_0F9E290855AC1880">
proposed or intended but what is for the public good; for if either house were to be governed by the hopes of reward, I am sure it could be of no service to the people, and of very little even to the crown itself; because the design and use of parlia|ments is, that they may be a check upon the con|duct of ministers; and no man, whose behaviour in this house is governed by his hopes of reward, will ever set himself up for a check upon the conduct of those who alone can bestow the reward he expects. We must, therefore, suppose that ministers may prevail with a majority of this house to approve or agree to what appears to be for the public service, without having it in their power to give a title, post, or pension to every one that approves of their measures; otherwise we must conclude that no such house ought to exist, and, consequently, that the very form of a limited government ought to be abolished in this selfish and corrupt nation. What effect some late corrupt practices may have had upon the genius and morals of the lower sort of people, I do not know, but I hope it has as yet had little or none upon the generality of those that have any chance of being members of this house; and unless they are become very much degenerated, we must, from experience, conclude, that when our ministers pursue popular and right measures, they may depend upon the assistance and approba|tion of parliament. This, I say, we must from experience conclude: for in former ages our mini|sters had few rewards to bestow, and yet they never failed of having the parliament's approbation, when their measures were such as were agreeable to the people. Nay, from the very nature of the case, we must draw the same conclusion; for a house of
<PB N="72" REF="013851_0603_0F9E290946E5F9D8">
commons freely chosen by the people must approve of what the people approves of. If from selfish motives they should disapprove or oppose such mea|sures, the opposing members would be sure of being turned out at the next election; and as the king has it in his power to bring on a new election whenever he pleases, his ministers may easily get rid of such selfish mean spirited members, and may consequently, if they desire it, always have a par|liament generally composed of gentlemen of true honour and public spirit; but the contrary is what most ministers desire, as has of late been mani|fest from the characters of those who were generally set up as candidates upon the court interest. We can never, therefore, be in danger of anarchy or confusion from its not being in the power of a mini|ster to bribe a majority of this house into his mea|sures. When bribery and corrupt motives prevail within doors, they will certainly prevail without, and then we may see a member burnt in effigy one year, in the public streets of his borough, and re|chosen the year following as their representative in a new parliament. We may see the most notorious fraudulent practices by the underlings in power, and these underlings encouraged by the minister, and protected by a majority in parliament: we may see the most unpopular and destructive measures pursued by our ministers, and all approved, nay, applauded by parliament. These things we may see, Sir: these things we have seen within these last twenty years; and this has brought affairs both at home and abroad into the melancholy situation which is now acknowledged by all, and will soon, I fear, be severely felt by the whole nation.</Q></P>

The worthy gentleman who was at the head of our former administration, and is now so deservedly sent to the other house, had, whilst he was a country gentleman, so strenu|ously opposed keeping up a numerous standing army in time of peace, that after he became a minister, though excess of modesty could never be reckoned among his foibles, he had not the assurance directly to oppose a reduction. No, Sir, during the first part of his administration, he always declared himself for a reduction as soon as a favourable opportunity should offer. But he always endeavoured to shew, that the present, was not a proper opportunity; and at last
<PB N="74" REF="013851_0605_0F9E290A9174CBB8">

<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">POLIT.

A man's being honest and benevolent, for instance, is not enough to recommend him to the office of a commander either by sea or land, if he is timid, or unskilful in war; and another's being full of military courage and conduct, is no reason why he should be a financier, or a treasurer. We consider very little, whether the man be fit, or unfit, for the place. We consider chiefly whether the place, that is the salary, is fit for him; we consider what power he has, by parliamenteering, or otherwise, to support, or to prejudice, the schemes of the court. If he is likely to

him, there could be no reflection made upon the minister, if he was not advanced. <HI>Walpole</HI> was always sorry, when a place fell vacant. By filling it, he gained one friend, and 20 enemies; any one of which could injure him, more than the person advanced could serve him. When men are gratified without merit, they are not so easily satisfied, as when they are rewarded in some proportion to their deserv|ings. For this very proportion will in some degree regulate their expectations.

<P>The Abb&eacute; <HI>S.

All honours and pow|ers (except, for plain reasons, the regal) ought to be personal only, and to be given to no individuals, but such as, upon scrutiny, were found to be men of such distinguished worth, as to deserve to be raised to distinguished places, though sprung of mean parents <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">OUVR.

And would not this policy give greater scope for laudable ambition, than our present, which insures the most worthless and most uncultivated blockhead of a dukedom, and a seat in the house of peers, if he hap|pens to be born by a duchess, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever may have begot him?

<P>Kings, and king's favourites often read their sin (in this as in other respects) in their punishment. If they will employ unqualified persons, their business will be done accordingly. The great <HI>Dutch Nassau</HI> fleet, fitted out by prince <HI>Maurice</HI> against the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> and officer'd according to the court interest, did nothing.

<P>That the merit chiefly regarded in our times, is the merit of seconding the views of the court, and that the greatest demerit, according to our modern way of esti|mating demerit, is opposing court measures; appears from the court's late proceedings against my incompa|rable friend, the great Dr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> whom they have deprived of his place of deputy post-master of <HI>North America,</HI> which place he himself improved from be|ing a burthen upon the government, to its bringing in a revenue of several thousands a year;&mdash;all because that faithful trustee would not sit silent, and see his constituents betrayed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Profusion in Places and Pensions.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not a little to the disgrace of human nature, that in any age, or in any country, any member of society should require to be paid, like a hireling, for serving his country. Every state is a great family. The ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g is, or should be, the father of it; the gran|dees, the elder brothers; and the people the younger children. But what should we think of a family, of which we saw the head, and the elder brothers, plun|dering the younger children of their portions, and reducing them to a starving condition; insisting that themselves ought to be supported in their grandeur, and recompensed for taking upon them the charge of domestic affairs, in such an exorbitant manner, as the younger part of the family could by no means support. If this head of a family, or these grandees, should de|mand a recompense for services done to a <HI>neighbouring</HI> family, we should not so much wonder or blame them for a sordid disposition. When the people of <HI>Poland</HI> wanted to have our celebrated Sir <HI>Philip Sidney</HI> for their king, it had been no matter of wonder, if he had required an ample civil list revenue, as a recompense for the innumerable disgusts and fatigues of the regal station, or that, like the <HI>German</HI> generals whom we have employed in our continental wars, he had been less sparing of the purses of the <HI>Polish</HI> people. If we were to do the <HI>Dutch</HI> any material service, it might be expected, that we should demand a proper compensa|tion; but that <HI>Englishmen</HI> should hesitate about serving <HI>Englishmen,</HI> that a lord, who has no necessary business

to fatigue him, but drinking, whoring, masquerad|ing, and <HI>New-marketing,</HI> should grudge a few hours in a week to serve his country, unless his country will recompence him ten thousand times above the worth of his service,&mdash;this gives a shocking idea of the sordid disposition of the grandees of modern times. At the same time the public ought not to be, and hardly ever is, ungrateful. But public rewards ought rather to be honorary, than pecuniary, and if they must be of the latter sort, they ought to be frugal, not profuse; else they do more mischief than good.</P>
<P>The salaries annexed to those places, the holders of which do <HI>real</HI> service to their country, naturally lead people to a very wrong way of thinking, <HI>viz.</HI> That we are not obliged to serve our country, unless we be <HI>paid</HI> for our service. Whereas, the truth is, that serving our country to the utmost of our power, is (like obedience to parents, providing for our wives and children, and worshipping God) our indispensible duty, <HI>previously</HI> to any <HI>emolument</HI> we may expect on that account. See Mr. <HI>Southwel</HI>'s speech below.</P>
<P>As for the holders of sinecures, and those men who receive annual pensions for nothing, they may be com|pared to <HI>Pluto</HI>'s three-headed mastiff, <HI>Cerberus,</HI> who gobbled up the sop thrown to him by the <HI>Sibyl,</HI> and immediately stretched out his hairy bulk in his kennel, and fell a snoring.</P>

But to return to our subject, the profusion in places and pensions.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Molesworth</HI> thinks, the servants of the crown should be paid by appointment of parliament. It may be said, all monies expended are subject to parliamen|tary enquiry. But there is a very great difference between appropriating beforehand, and finding fault afterwards, when the money is spent, and all that can be done is passing a vote. And even that is not to be expected, if our parliaments, instead of checks, are to be sharers in the plunder.</P>
<P><Q>A king, as such, ought not, of all men, to grant bounties; because what he grants is not out of his <HI>own,</HI> but the property of <HI>others</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>St. Pierre,</HI> VI.54.</NOTE>.</Q>
All that a king is, and all that he has as king, is on account of the <HI>public,</HI> whose servant (to use king <HI>Iam.</HI> Ist's expres|sion) he is. Therefore, whatever he gives to his wh&mdash;, or his minion, is a <HI>robbery</HI> of the public, because his wh&mdash;, or his minion, are of no advan|tage to the public, and have not earned any part of the public money; but on the contrary, deserve the strapado, or the gallows. And whatever a king gives, or suffers his ministers to give, to the undeserving, or what they give too profusely to the deserving, is a robbery of the public. A king's income is not as a gentleman's rent, a private fund at his disposal. For a kingdom is not a private estate; but a trust for which the holder is accountable to his people. And
<PB N="95" REF="013851_0626_0F9E292096E626F0">
wo to those kings and ministers, who betray so awful a trust. A king is to dispense, not to spend the pub|lic money. There are many persons necessarily to be employed in a state. Them the king is to pay. How then (says <HI>St. Pierre</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">VI.55.</NOTE>) can he have bounties to grant? unless he robs some of those who serve the public? Every guinea he gives to one, who has <HI>not deserved</HI> it, or who has not deserved it <HI>all,</HI> is so much kept back from one, who has deserved it, or would, if he had not been discouraged by seeing a traiterous king or ministry embezzling the public money, by throwing it away on the worthless, to the injury of the deserving. A king, as a gentleman, and out of his official and accountable character, may bestow upon his lawful pleasures, or upon those who have served his lawful private interests, more than a duke may lay out; but not more than <HI>two</HI> dukes may spend. If he lays out the public money, or suffers his crew to lay it out, in bribing villains to betray liberty, I have only to say, <HI>I lictor, deliga ad palum, virgis caedito, caput obnubito, infelici arbori suspendito.</HI></P>
<P>Our courtiers find the parliament too ready to give. Therefore, according to the common saying,
<Q>Lightly come, lightly gone,</Q>
they care not how they dissipate their ill gotten riches. <HI>Ch.</HI> VII. of <HI>France,</HI> a prince of an excellent character, was, at his accession, so low in both cash and credit, that he had not ready money to pay for a pair of boots, that were brought him; and the maker, not caring to trust his poor majesty, carried them away. This narrowness of circumstances gave that wise and good prince a handle to retrench unnecessary expences, and
<PB N="96" REF="013851_0627_0F9E2924119A1698">
set out on a foot of great frugality, which he con|tinued after his finances were more flourishing <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">MOD. UNIV. HIST. XXIV.45.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The enormous emoluments annexed to our great offices of the state, are big with every evil. They render the sincerity of real patriots suspected, and expose the administration to the certain execration of the people, who, by this means, are often re|duced to an uncertainty whom to trust. Pensions and places are rightly bestowed in very few in|stances. They are a disgrace to men of family and fortune, be their services to their country what they will. For pensioning such men is making them appear to the public not noble, not generous, not magnanimous; but greedy, sordid hirelings. A pen|sion may perhaps be rightly given to an ingenious, but poor man, to support him in his pursuit of arts, science, manufactures, commerce, or whatever may be for the public advantage. But care ought to be taken, that he be not over-fed, and by that means become lazy.</P>
<P>There is no magnanimity without some degree of self-denial. But what self-denial do our nobility and gentry shew, when they scramble for the profitable places, and will not serve their country, unless they be overpaid immensely beyond the worth of their services? If a nobleman has in his mind nothing more noble, or disinterested, than an artizan or a plough-driver, what claim has he to more respect than they would have, if they had as much money in their pockets, or as much lace on their waistcoats, as he has?</P>
<P>If the nobility were to serve their country in the great offices of the state gratis, the heroism would be
<PB N="97" REF="013851_0628_0F9E29241C040EE0">
nothing more than is shewn by private trustees, arbi|trators, church-wardens, overseers of the poor, and other parish-officers. Are those poor low-bed crea|tures, whom our polite courtiers call the scum of the earth, more disinterested than the nobility of the land?</P>
<P>By 43 <HI>Eliz.</HI> any person elected overseer of the poor, and refusing to do the duty, is punishable, though he has no reward for doing the duty. Why should not all public officers be filled in this manner<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">STAT. AT LARGE, II.318.</NOTE>? If it be alledged that this would be troublesome, and fall heavy upon the nobility, let them take the offices by rotation.</P>
<P>Even in the law some things are appointed to be done gratis <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blackst.</HI> COMM. III.128.</NOTE>. It is hard, that our nobility should be loth to do for their country what the lawyers (a sordid enough set of men) do every day.</P>
<P>If the nobility and gentry declined serving their country in the great offices of the state, without sordid hire, let the honest bourgeoisie be employed. They will think themselves sufficiently rewarded by the honour done them.</P>
<P>Why should not our kings, when a court-place falls vacant, publish, that they want a secretary of state, or a lord chamberlain, or a lord steward; places which any man of common sense and common honesty can fill; the public business being all a mere routine. And why should they not order all persons desirous of the vacant employment to send in their proposals sealed (as when there is a fleet to victual, or a pub|lic work to be done) and accept him, who offers to serve his country on the most reasonable terms? Let
<PB N="98" REF="013851_0629_0F9E2925454DCDA8">
the person chosen, bring in his bill of expence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. There is no reason why the public should not repay what is fairly laid out for the public benefit. If it be thought proper to give a statesman, who has shewn himself able and honest, five hundred guineas for a ring, as was given the brave admiral <HI>Drake</HI> for ser|vices of greater danger and more importance, than those of fifty state-secretaries, I have no objection. But that half our nobility should be upon the parish, I mean, upon the public, I own I see no manner of reason; nor that a set of places, which might be filled at the expence of a few hundreds a year, must cost the nation many hundred thousands, while we are sinking in a bottomless sea of debt.</P>
<P>The grand <HI>Turk,</HI> when he thinks a wazir, an aga, a teftardar, a pasha, &amp;c. has, by oppression, spunged up a good deal of money in his service, squeezes him till he has reduced him to his former condition, which often helps up the sultan's exhausted treasure. If we were to introduce such a custom as this in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> the squeezings of a thousand or two of our over-drenched court-spunges, might do somewhat toward preventing the dreaded necessity of applying a spunge to our public debts.</P>
<P>It is commonly reckoned, that five or six of our places or pensions are equal in their annual amount to all that is paid in the three provinces of <HI>Holland, Zealand,</HI> and <HI>Overyssel,</HI> to placemen and pensioners. The burgomaster of a great town has perhaps 20 <HI>l.</HI> a year salary. The deputies or members of parlia|ment have 200 <HI>l.</HI> a year. One happy consequence is, that there is

<P>Ask the courtiers, what produces the present cla|mours, and all clamours against government, which is always immaculate. They will answer, The desire of places and preferments.

<P><Q>I may suppose,</Q>
(says Mr. <HI>Southwel</HI> in his speech on a motion for a deduction from salaries during the continuance of a war)

<P><Q>I do not wonder, Sir, to hear a placeman affirm|ing, that our public employments are attended with vast trouble and expence, and the salaries and per|quisites belonging to them are no more than they deserve; but most other gentlemen in the kingdom are convinced, that few or none of our public em|ployments are attended with any expence, and that the business in every one of them might be performed for much less that it is at present; for as to the expence, we all know that every shilling of it is, in most of our public offices, defrayed by the public. The officers are not obliged to furnish themselves with so much as pens, ink, and paper out of their salaries; but have these and many other articles provided for them at the public charge.</Q>
[In the year 1773, it was found, that the public has long been charged near 5000 <HI>l.</HI> a year for pens, ink, and paper for the house of commons.]
<Q>And as to the business, it is well known, that in all our offices,
<PB N="111" REF="013851_0642_0F9E293045E4DD88">
those who do the most business have the smallest salaries. Nay, in many of our public posts, the man who has the place with the salary annexed to it, gets a deputy to do the business for, perhaps, a tenth part of the salary, and sometimes the deputy has no part of the salary, but the perquisites only, or, perhaps, but a share of them. These being facts notoriously known, I shall very readily agree with the honourable gentleman, that a strict parli|amentary enquiry into all our public posts and offices is very necessary, and might be of great ser|vice to the nation. If such an enquiry were strictly and impartially carried through, we might not only reduce the salaries and perquisites of most of the officers and placemen in the kingdom, but a vast number of useless officers and placemen might be laid aside, and several of the offices that have been of late years erected, might be entirely abolished; which would not only be a great saving to the pub|lic, but a great security to the liberty of the people. But such an enquiry, Sir, I despair of ever seeing set on foot, and much more of ever seeing it carried on with effect; therefore, since we cannot remove the evil, I am for making the most we can of it, by subjecting all salaries and pensions to a double tax; nor am I in the least afraid of doing injustice to any placeman, by not leaving him a sufficient compensation for all the business he does for the public; for in all our offices there is so little business done, or such a number of persons employed, that one moiety of the salary, and in many cases much less than a moiety, would be a sufficient reward for all the business they do. With regard to pen|sioners, I am so far from being afraid of doing them injustice, that, as to most of them, I believe, if we
<PB N="112" REF="013851_0643_0F9E2933ACC24850">
stripped them entirely of their pensions, we should do a piece of signal service, as well as justice to the public; for I have a strong suspicion that most of the pensions that have been granted of late years, were granted for what ought rather to be called ministerial than public service.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The customs and sentiments of a people always depend upon the customs and sentiments of the rich and great families amongst them. If the rich and great are selfish and mercenary, the same spirit will soon prevail generally among the people. Prevent its being in the power of the rich and great to be selfish and mercenary, and they will soon begin to be actuated by motives of ambition and the desire of public esteem; and from them the same spirit will diffuse itself through the whole body of the people. The monstrous salaries that have been of late years annexed to all the high offices in our government, and granted without distinction to the rich as well as the poor, have raised such a selfish spirit among the people, that a man is now reckoned a fool or a madman if he gives himself any trouble about serving his country without some pecuniary reward.
<Q>Quis nisi mentis inops oblatum respuat aurum?</Q>
Diminish those salaries, Sir, and grant them to none but such as stand in need of them for their support, or for supporting the dignity of their office, and you will put it out of the power of the rich to be governed by pecuniary motives. Among them the motives of ambition and public esteem will soon resume their proper seat, and a generous desire to serve one's country without any pecuniary reward will from them diffuse itself through the
<PB N="113" REF="013851_0644_0F9E2934D1B46CC8">
whole body of the people, insomuch that it may very soon become scandalous to desire any of the public money if a man can serve his country and support himself without it. I know, Sir, it may be said, that unless you grant such salaries as may be a temptation to men of fortune to serve the pub|lic, no man of fortune will ever enter into the public service. This I take to be a very severe satire upon our men of fortune. It is supposing that they are governed by nothing but sordid and mean pecuniary considerations; that they have no regard for their country, nor will do it any service unless they can thereby supply their luxury or satisfy their avarice. But I have not so bad an opinion of our men of for|tune, or the men of fortune of any country. Put pecuniary considerations out of the way, and mere generous motives will take their place. Nay, men of fortune would engage in the public service, if it were for nothing else but to have something to do, for a state of mere idleness is, above all others, the most irksome; of which we may be convinced, by observing the many inventions of men for pre|venting their being in such a state. Many other motives would engage them in the public service, and even in that service which, above all others, is the most dangerous and toilsome; I mean the army, especially in time of war. This we may be con|vinced of from what is now the case in <HI>France:</HI> The pay of the officers of their army is so small, that it can be a temptation to no man of fortune; and the colonel of a regiment must always, in that service, be at a much greater expence than his pay will answer. Yet there is hardly a man of fortune in that country who is not, or has not been, in the army, unless it be such as have been b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to the law. The case
<PB N="114" REF="013851_0645_0F9E293573E199D8">
would soon be the same in this country, Sir, if pecuniary temptations were once removed, or very much diminished; and besides the public saving, it would contribute not a little towards putting an end to the luxury and extravagance that now prevail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> among our quality and chief gentlemen; for among men of fortune the public money, like money got by gambling, is generally spent in luxury and ex|travagance. I may say it is always so, except when it falls into the hands of some covetous, avaritious creature, and then it contributes, perhaps, to enrich a family, that was before richer than is consistent with the happiness and constitution of this king|dom; for it is our business to have many rich fami|lies amongst us, but none too rich: and I am sure it is not the business of any state to contribute, at the public expence, towards the supply of luxury or the satisfaction of avarice, neither of which can ever be fully supplied or satisfied, nor will ever say he has enough. To a luxurious man, the more you give the more methods of expence he will always invent; and money to an avaritious man is like water to a drop|sical, the more you give the more he will desire. I believe no one who hears me will say, that public spirit and disinterested regard for our country is not now at a very low ebb among the people of this kingdom. What is the cause of this? The cause is plain and evident. The great salaries, and many unlawful, I may say, cruel, perquisites that have been of late years connived at, or by law, or custom, annexed to most of the high offices in the kingdom, have introduced this spirit too generally amongst our noble and rich families; and as such families may be called the heart and vitals of the people, the corruption has from thence diffused itself through
<PB N="115" REF="013851_0646_0F9E293614EBCDF0">
the whole body. This is the true cause, Sir, and the remedy is as obvious as the disease. The rich and great will have a concern in the government of their country, if they can. You have no occasion to invite them by lucrative temptations. If you do not invite them by such temptations, they will take that concern from motives that are generous and consistent with the public good. Public spirit, and a desire of esteem, will then be their only motives for engaging, or desiring to be engaged, in the pub|lic service; and when this spirit begins to prevail generally among the rich and great, the people, as they always do, will soon begin to follow their example. As men are naturally fond of power, though attended with no sordid gain, ambition may still cause a contention who shall serve their country in the highest offices; but that contention will never be so violent, as to produce faction, nor can it pro|duce any dangerous opposition to a wise and upright government, because among a people generally governed by virtue and public spirit, no ambitious man can form a party against such a government; and much less can he form a party for overturning the liberties of his country, because the ambition of one man will always be a check to the ambition of another; for no man who is actuated by ambition only, will ever consent to give <HI>himself</HI> an abso|lute master; but a luxurious or avaritious man may very readily consent to give even <HI>himself</HI> an absolute master, if he may thereby hope to supply his lux|ury or indulge his avarice. We may thus see, Sir, that a stop must be put to the selfish mercenary spirit that now prevails among the people, if we have a mind to preserve our liberties. Such a law as I have mentioned would certainly be the most
<PB N="116" REF="013851_0647_0F9E29370FD24718">
effectual method for this purpose. It must be con|fessed by every one who can talk impartially of matters relating to government, that officers and placemen are proportionably more numerous in this country than in any other on earth; and the profits so vastly exceed the service required, that every man is fond of getting a place under the government, because in no sort of business he can earn so much for a little service. Justice, therefore, can require of us no exception, but that mentioned by my ho|nourable friend who made you this motion, I mean that of the judges; and no compassion can prompt us to go further than to places or pensions of 50 <HI>l.</HI> a year and under. These are all the exceptions that either justice or compassion can require of us, and admitting these, I am convinced the additional tax proposed would produce a very considerable yearly revenue, especially if the commissioners of the land-tax should fall upon a way of subjecting perquisites, as well as salaries, to this double tax; which, I think, they might easily do, and ought to do; for the perquisites of offices are very different from the fees of lawyers, physicians, or pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sons, and still more different from the wages of journeymen. These are the price, and the only price they have for their labour or attendance; but the perquisites of offices are not the price of labour or attendance. They have their salaries for the price of their labour and attendance; and their perquisites are the price only of their impudence and imposition, commodities which, I am sure, ought to be taxed as high as any that are produced or imported; and that they may be highly taxed is one of my chief reasons for approv|ing this motion <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB.

<P><Q>Sir, As reformation of abuses in the church has always been a most frightful word to priests, so re|formation in government has always, for the same reason, been equally terrible to ministers: Those abuses in religion which make a reformation neces|sary, have generally been introduced by the cunning of priests, for increasing their own power or their re|venues; and those abuses in government which render a reformation necessary, have generally been intro|duced by the cunning of ministers, in order to encrease their own power or profits. These two orders of men have therefore the same reason to dread a refor|mation, because it must be attended with a diminution of their power or their profits, and probably with a very great diminution of both. For this reason, Sir, when I hear a minister running out against refor|mation, and dressing it up in all the hobgobling shapes his fancy can suggest, I always think of the priests of <HI>Diana</HI> at <HI>Ephesus:</HI> It is not the danger that threatens the public, but the danger that threatens their shrine, which they are afraid of; and as the over-grown power of ministers is of as pernicious consequence to free government as the over-grown power of priests is to true religion, a reformation is as often necessary in one case as the other. This is the foundation of that maxim laid down by <HI>Machi|avel,</HI> that in order to preserve a free government, it often becomes necessary to bring it back to the first principles, which is a maxim the friends of liberty will always take care to observe, and we may ex|pect that it will be as constantly opposed by ministers,

who always have been, and always will be, grasping at arbitrary power. Upon this principle, Sir, let us examine the motion now before us, in order to see whether it is not returning a step back toward our ancient constitution. I am sure, no man, who has read the history of the nation, will say that our ancestors the <HI>Saxons</HI> ever thought of inviting men to serve the public by great salaries or pensions. On the contrary, we know that all those offices that are of the true <HI>Saxon</HI> originals, such as sheriffs, parish offices, and most of our offices in cities and boroughs, are attended with an expence, instead of being of any advantage to the officers. At least if they now make any advantage of them, it is by some innovation unknown to our ancestors, and such a one as they never would have allowed to be introduced. But the crown, having, by some means or other, got into its possession the arbitrary disposal of almost all offices and places, ministers soon found that the more valuable these offices and places were made, the more their power would be extended; therefore they resolved to make th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">m lu|crative as well as honourable, and from that time they have been by degrees increasing, not only the number of offices and places, but also the profits and perquisites of each. Not only large salaries have been annexed to every place or office under the government, but many of the officers have been allowed to oppress the subjects by sale of the places under them, and by exacting extravagant and un|reasonable fees, which have been so long suffered, that they are now looked on as the legal perquisites of the office. Nay, in many offices, they seem to have got a customary right to defraud the public; and we know how careful some of our late ministers
<PB N="119" REF="013851_0650_0F9E293C06A30538">
have been to prevent or defeat any parliamentary enquiry into the conduct and management of any office. By these means, Sir, the expence of our civil government is become so great, that it is hardly in the power of the people to support it. At least it is not in their power to support the expence of our civil government, and at the same time to support a foreign war with that vigour which is necessary for bringing it to a happy and speedy conclusion. But this is not the only inconvenience that attends the multitude of offices and places under our government, and the large salaries and perquisites annexed to them: They not only render it impossible for us to support or carry on a foreign war with vigour, but they render it impossible for us to preserve our liberties without some great reformation in our constitution. The motion now before us does not therefore proceed from any extravagant spirit of reformation, but from a just sense of the danger we are exposed to, if we do not reform. As to the danger that threatens our liberties, I do not much wonder at our ministers not being affected with it; because from the whole course of our history, as well as from late experience, I have observed that as soon as a gentleman becomes a minister, or, as he calls himself, a servant of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">own, he shakes of all concern for the liberty of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ountry; and what|ever professions some of our present ministers may have formerly made, I am afraid it will be found, that they have no more virtue than their predecessors. For this reason, I say, Sir, I do not wonder at our ministers not being affected with the danger our liberties may be in from the number of our officers, and the high salaries annexed to their several offices; but as to the danger we are exposed to by our in|ability
<PB N="120" REF="013851_0651_0F9E293C12308A38">
to support a foreign war, I wonder that even our ministers are not affected with it. My wonder does not arise, Sir, from any high notion I have of their virtue or love for their country, but from my being convinced that they have a great love for them|selves, and a paramount regard for their own safety and interest.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Southwel</HI> observes, that the ministry were in some danger, left the people, provoked on thinking how they are taxed, while the curtiers are wallowing in places and pensions, might make an insurrection to the danger of their plunderers. Then he goes on as follows:</P>
<P><Q>Men, Sir, who are capable of judging without pre|judice, I am sure, must be sensible of the great danger our liberties are in from the vast influence the crown has of late years acquired by the multiplication of offices, and the increase of officers as well as the increase of their salaries and perquisites; for surely no gentleman will say that our monarchy would continue to be a limited monarchy, if the crown were sure of having always a parliament at its devotion; and that this may be the case, that this will be the case, is I think absolutely certain, if some effectual methods be not very soon taken to prevent it. A reformation therefore of some kind or other is become absolutely necessary, if we intend to preserve our liberties. A place-bill, and a bill for excluding officers of all ranks and degrees, with a very few exceptions, from voting at elections, would have some effect; but it is very certain that the most effectual method would be to diminish the number and value of those gifts which the crown has a power to bestow; and the motion now before us, is, I think, the most obvious step, and the first step we ought to take for this purpose. The motion
<PB N="121" REF="013851_0652_0F9E293D4293FD08">
is in itself so reasonable, and the honourable gentle|man who made it has chosen such a seasonable and critical conjuncture for offering it to our conside|ration, that if it be not agreed to, I shall despair of ever seeing any effectual law made for preventing that corrupt influence which the crown has a power to make use of both in parliament and at elections. A new administration may, in order to gain a little popularity, at their first entrance into power, connive at the introducing and passing, or may themselves introduce and promote, some bill, that has a specious appearance of being in favour of liberty; but I shall never expect an effectual bill from that quarter. I have such an opinion of ministers, that I cannot be easily convinced, that they will ever consent to have their power effectually abridged; therefore I must be of opinion, that if ever any such bill be passed, it must make its way through this house against the power and influence of the administration, and must be forced through the other two branches of the legis|lature, or one of them at least, by the obstinate virtue of this assembly. Thank God, we have still the power in our hands, in some measure, to compel a compliance with what our constituents as well as ourselves think absolutely necessary for the preser|vation of our constitution. But in the case now before us, we have no occasion to make any extraor|dinary use of our power: no tacking is proposed: no refusal nor any delay of the supplies is desired: What my honourable friend has proposed, comes not only naturally but necessarily into a supply-bill, and consequently must be agreed to by the other two branches of the legislature, or the whole of this branch of the supply must be lost. If therefore such a natural and such a well-judged proposal as
<PB N="122" REF="013851_0653_0F9E293DAA08AA78">
this in favour of our liberties be rejected by this house, can I suppose that ever any other can make its way against the torrent of ministerial favour?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Southwel</HI> then goes on to shew the particular propriety of a saving scheme at a time, when the na|tion was engaged in a war against <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>&punc; with no allies, but such as were more a burden than an advantage, overloaded with debts and taxes, the incomes of the sinking fund on the decline, foreign trade lessened, &amp;c. Then he proceeds as follows:</P>
<P><Q>In these circumstances, Sir, and when we are in so much danger of being run out before the war can be brought to a period, will any gentleman say, that we ought to allow our ministers, placemen, and pen|sioners, to enjoy the same salaries and pensions they were provided with in time of peace? Or that we ought not to deduct some part of their salaries or pensions, or subject them to some higher tax than any other sort of people? But this, it is said, is the practice of arbitrary governments, or of princes that are aiming at arbitrary power; and we ought not to make their conduct a precedent for ours. Can this be called reasoning? Because an arbitrary govern|ment does a just or a right thing, therefore we are never to do so. If we can find no precedent for this in any of the free governments of <HI>Europe,</HI> it is be|cause their ministers and officers have either no sala|ries at all, or no more than is absolutely necessary for supporting the dignity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their office. But our mi|nisters and officers have higher salaries and perqui|sites in proportion, than the ministers and officers even of any arbitrary government in <HI>Europe</HI>; and since we imitate them in granting high salaries and pensions, we ought to imitate them in making deduc|tions, when we are involved in a foreign war. This
<PB N="123" REF="013851_0654_0F9E293E58D3E178">
was done by the court of <HI>Spain,</HI> as soon as war was declared against us, if there is any credit to be given to our gazettes, and news-papers. In order to pro|vide for the expence of the war, that court began with reducing the appointments of all their officers, both civil and military, and with annihilating the perquisites of many others. The same thing was done by the court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> when they found them|selves attacked by <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> In <HI>Russia</HI> like|wise, they made large deductions from the salaries of their officers during the war with <HI>Sweden</HI>; and even lately in <HI>Denmark,</HI> when there was but the appearance of a war with <HI>Sweden,</HI> his <HI>Danish</HI> majesty began with laying a tax upon all salaries, in proportion to their yearly produce. If no such thing has been practised by <HI>France,</HI> it is because the quality in that kingdom are proud of serving the government both in the civil and military offices, especially the latter, without any considerable pecuniary reward. As many of our nobility and rich gentry are able enough to support the dignity of any public office, they can be preferred to, out of their own private fortunes, surely no man will say, that it would not be generous in them to do so at a time, when their country is in such danger and distress. And even when an officer has no private fortune of his own, but has a good salary from the public, surely it would be generous and right in him to contract his way of living, and give up one half of his salary in a time of public dis|tress. If our public officers will not voluntarily do what is generous and right, they ought to be made to do so by some public regulation, for which pur|pose nothing better can I think be contrived, than the proposal now under consideration. The opposi|tion made by our ministers to this motion, is in
<PB N="124" REF="013851_0655_0F9E293F16596B98">
my opinion a most convincing proof of the corrupt influence that proceeds from the lucrativeness of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> public offices and employments. This of itself alone, ought to be a prevailing argument with every lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of liberty, to render them less lucrative, even supp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ing that the public distress did not make it necessary&punc; Ministers may perhaps think, that nothing but lucr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tive motives will prevail with men to accept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> places or employments in the government of their country, because nothing but a mercenary spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prompt a man to accept of any such, upon the term<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they are generally offered by ministers, I mean upon condition of betraying their country in parliament, or at elections; but if we have a mind to prese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> our liberties, I am sure we ought not to enable the crown or its ministers, to get any servants upon such terms. If the country is to be served by none but such as will agree to betray its liberties, I had rather chuse it should not be served at all; for anarchy is better than an established tyranny, because from confusion, order may be brought forth; whereas from an esta|blished tyranny, nothing but irretrievable oppression is to be expected. Therefore, if it were true, that nothing but lucrative motives could in <HI>England</HI> pre|vail upon men to serve their country, it would with me be no argument against rendering the temptation less cogent; because a small salary may prevail upon a poor man to serve the public, and a poor man is not so able to support an oppressive government, as an avaricious or luxurious rich man may be. But, Sir, whatever our ministers may think, whatever bad opinion they may have of their countrymen, I have no such opinion of them. If nothing but honourable services were required, men of honour would engage in the service of their country, with|out
<PB N="125" REF="013851_0656_0F9E2940337EC8F8">
any pecuniary reward. And I do not think it in the least difficult to introduce such a custom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would make it dishonourable in any man of for|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne to desire or accept of a sordid pecuniary reward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> salary, for any service he did, or could do his country. To talk of a man's right to a pecuniary reward for serving his country, is to talk in that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mercenary style, which has been designedly in|troduced of late years, in order to propagate minis|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rial corruption; but to talk justly, no man has a right to a pecuniary reward for any service he can do his country. Sir, the service of our country is like the service of God; when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and no man can have a right to a reward, for doing no more than his duty. The rewards therefore bestowed for public services, are not what any man has a right to demand, but such only as generosity, charity, or prudence, may induce the country to bestow: and I am sure neither generosity, charity, nor prudence, can be pleaded for giving large, or indeed any pecuniary rewards, to those who are already possessed of exor|bitant riches; and when a country is itself in the utmost distress, surely it ought not to grant such high pecuniary rewards, even to those that stand in need of them, as it may do when it is in affluent circumstances; but our conduct in this country, seems to have been directly contrary to these maxims. I am sure it cannot be said that we have been in affluent circumstances for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se thirty years past: I believe every impartial man will grant, that we have been for that whole time in a declining condition; and yet in that time, we have not only augmented very needlessly the number of our public officers and servants, but we have greatly augmented the salaries
<PB N="126" REF="013851_0657_0F9E29410BD4F610">
and perquisites of many of them. We may easily guess, Sir, with what view these augmentations were made, and we may be convinced that the same view now creates an opposition to their being reduced. It is not the danger, Sir, of drawing men of fortun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the service of their country, but the danger of drawing men of fortune from the service of ministers, that creates an opposition to this motion; but this is so far from being a reason for me to oppose it, that it is one of the strongest arguments I can think of for agreeing to it. I wish we could draw every man of fortune from that service, for none but men who are entirely governed by their avarice or luxury, will ever enter into the service of ministers, upon the terms they require; and in the hands of such men, neither the counsels nor the treasure of the country can be safe. A poor man may be honest and faithful, but an avaricious man will be neither, if he can safely indulge his avarice by being otherwise. A poor man may live contented upon a small salary, but a luxurious man no income can satisfy, therefore he will endeavour by any means to get a supply. Can we expect, Sir, that either the counsels or treasure of our country will be safe in the hands of those, who in order to get them into their hands, have agreed to betray the liberties of their country. Sir, if they do not sell the counsels of their country, it is because they cannot find a purchaser; and if they do not convert the treasure of their country to their own use, it is because they are afraid of punishment. There is more danger therefore, with regard to the public counsels or treasure, in having such men of fortune employed, than in having men of no fortune employed in the public service; and with regard to our liberties, the danger is infinitely greater, because
<PB N="127" REF="013851_0658_0F9E294181A514E0">
men of no fortune could not betray the liberties of their country by getting into parliament, nor could they so powerfully assist an oppressive administration in corrupting our elections. For this reason, Sir, we ought not to provide any ministry with the means of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mpting the avaracious or luxurious rich to accept of places or employments in the government; and much smaller salaries or profits, than are annexed to most of these places, would be a sufficient temptation, because they would be a sufficient support for gentle|men of no fortune. There is therefore no weight in the objection made to this proposal, That it would drive all gentlemen of fortune and character out of the public service; because it would drive no gentleman of fortune out of the service, but such as ought not to be allowed to enter in to it; or who at least ought not to be tempted by lucrative consi|derations to enter into it, especially as long as such temptations are at the disposal of our ministers, and as long as a lucrative place in the government is no objection to a gentleman's being a member of this house. The only remaining objection I have heard made to this proposal is, That it would make but a very small addition to our public revenue, if we make those exceptions which justice and compassion require. I have already shewn, Sir, that justice has nothing to do in the question, because no man has a right to any pecuniary reward from the public; and as to compassion, it cannot I am sure carry us farther, than the honourable gentleman who made the motion has mentioned. Suppose then we except all salaries and pensions of 50<HI>l.</HI> a year and under, will any gen|tleman say, that 4<HI>s.</HI> in the pound upon all salaries and pensions above 50<HI>l.</HI> a year, would not produce a very considerable revenue?

<P>The court-sycophants pretend, that the dignity of the crown [the voracity of their extravagance, they should say] requires a great expence to support it, and particularly a numerous attendance at court. But the truth is, the greatness of a prince is never estimated according to the splendor of his court, unless it be by women and children. All mankind agree to pro|nounce him a great prince, who makes his enemies fear him, and his allies and subjects love him. And this is done by a procedure directly opposite to an unbounded expence laid out upon a set of idle hangers-on. But I shall have occasion to treat of regal parade hereafter. In the mean time, on the exorbitant num|ber of placemen, let us observe in what light the court-list exhibits that abuse.

Will any man say, and keep his countenance, that one in one hun|dred of these hangers-on is of any real use? Cannot our good king have a poached egg for his supper, unless he keeps a purveyor of eggs, and his clerks, and his clerk's deputy-clerks, at an expence of 500 <HI>l.</HI> a year? while the nation is sinking in a bottomless ocean of debt? Again, who are they, the yeomen of the mouth, and who are the under-yeomen of the mouth? What is their business? What is it to yeoman a king's mouth? What is the necessity for a cofferer, where there is a treasurer? And, where there is a cofferer, what occasion for a deputy-cof|ferer? Why a necessary-house-keeper? cannot a king have a water-closet, and keep the key of it in his own pocket? And my little cock and cryer, what can be his post? Does he come under the king's chamber window, and call the hour, mimicking the crowing of the cock? This might be of use before clocks and watches, especially repeaters, were invented; but seems as superfluous now, as the deliverer of greens, the coffee-women, spicery-men's assistant-clerks,

<P>The pretence, that a king ought to have a number of attendants about him, to keep up his state, and strike the people with an awe of government, wants no answer.

compelled to court first one and then the other side, as his necessities required; himself nourishing that disease, which, in the end, wasted his power; or if he had false cunning, and meditated in his mind to overthrow the laws underhand, he encouraged par|ties, kept them equally poised, and suffered them to consume their strength one against the other, in hopes they should be both so impaired by their mu|tual strivings, as to be unable to give him opposi|tion, and thus to become master of the whole at last. Whence came it, that countries have been ruined, by not consulting national interest? Either the prince himself had bad designs, or not being endowed with royal virtues, and destitute of wis|dom, he committed the administration of his affairs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> unskilful or corrupt hands. Whence was it that affecting arbitrary rule has so often thrown this kingdom into civil wars? The fault lay in the judges, who wrested law, and made it serve the turns of power; and in the ministers, who did not perform their duty in representing to the prince the danger of such measures. From whence have arisen those schisms by which the church has been so often rent asunder, but from neglect or unskilfulness in the general administration? From neglect, when the temple was suffered to be profaned by the licen|tious living, the pride, ignorance, and vices of the clergy, which might induce many to separate from such whose lives, they thought, were a blemish to their doctrine.

What

has most frequently been the cause of public wants, but a complication of mismanagements, as well in the prince as in his ministers? He omitted his part, which was to overlook them, and his negli|gence produced their corruption.

In governments ill administred, public wants lead the way; but private poverty follows close after; and when both happen together, which must always be the case at last, then is ruin near at hand.

<P>Let us hear, on this subject, Sir <HI>Francis Dashwood</HI> in the house of commons. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1745 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. II.331.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q>That there is a difference, Sir, between our con|stitution and establishment, that under the latter the former may be destroyed, and consequently the people divested of their rights and privileges, no one can deny, who considers the fatal effects of corruption; nor can any man pretend, that the people are not sensible of this difference, if he reflects upon the instructions that have been given by the people in all parts of the united kingdom, to their represen|tatives in this house. That the danger to which our constitution may be exposed by the success of the present rebellion is more imminent, no man, I believe, will openly deny; but that the danger to which it may be exposed by the success of corruption is more certain, every man must grant, who is not
<PB N="152" REF="013851_0683_0F9E2960EA129D58">
biassed by the post or pension by which his head is con|founded, though his heart may not perhaps be as yet corrupted. Should the rebellion be crowned with success, which I think we are in very little danger of; our constitution may be preserved even by the good sense of the pretender himself, if he has any, because a constitutionally limitted monarchy is more secure, and consequently more elegible to a king of good sense, than the most absolute one; but the sin|gular misfortune of corruption is, that a king may thereby be rendered absolute, even without his de|signing or knowing any thing of it, till it becomes im|possible for him to govern by any other means. Gen|tlemen I see, Sir, are surprized at such a new and ex|traordinary doctrine; but there is nothing more plain, if we consider the nature of government, and the only two methods by which it can be supported. No man, I believe, ever supposed that a government can be supported by a king or other supreme magistrate by himself alone. He must have a majority, or at least a great number of people, engaged with him to support the government, and these men must be en|gaged by the public interest, or each man by his own private interest. The multitude, I shall grant, may be kept in awe by their fears; but the most absolute, the most arbitrary tyrant must have a number of men engaged by their private interest sufficient to impress that fear. One single man may, by his authority, persuade a multitude; but a single man never can frighten a multitude. Every government must there+fore have a number of men for its support, and thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> men must be kept engaged to do so by the public, or by their private interest. When those who support the government are engaged to do so by the public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nte|rest alone, or by that chiefly, it is a free government,
<PB N="153" REF="013851_0684_0F9E29619A8D0AF8">
even though by its form it be supremely administered by one sole monarch. But when they who support the government are engaged to do so by their private interest alone, or by that chiefly, it is an absolute government, even though by its form it be supremely administered by a king, lords, and commons; and such a government can be supported no way but by corruption. If such a government be supremely ad|ministered by a sole monarch, he must have a merce|nary army for his support, and money enough to hire or corrupt them; and if such a government be by its form supremely administered by a king and parliament, he must have money enough to hire or corrupt his mercenary parliament, as well as his mercenary army. To apply this, Sir, to our con|stitution, and to shew that by corruption our king may, without his own knowledge, be rendered not only absolute, but unable to govern by any other means; it is very certain, that the freedom of our constitution consists in every man's being directed with respect to his voting both at elections, and in parliament, by the public interest alone, or by that chiefly: Whilst this continues to be the case, our constitution will be preserved, and we shall continue to be a free people. For this purpose, a public and disinterested spirit must be propagated and preserved among the people, and it will always be the king's interest to do so, because he can have no interest sepa|rate or distinct from that of his people. But ministers have often a private interest which is distinct from, and opposite to that of the people; and when any such man happens unfortunately to become the king's prime minister, he will make it his business to root out all public spirit, and to plant a selfish spirit in its stead. All the favours of the crown, and all the
<PB N="154" REF="013851_0685_0F9E288C81918CE0">
posts and offices in the kingdom will be bestowed, not upon those who deserve them, or are qualified for them, but upon those that vote in parliament, or at elections according to his direction, and without any regard to the national interest. This a cunning minister may do without its being possible for the king to discover it; because the king can know the merits or qualifications but of a very few of his subjects. By such means, a selfish venal spirit may be introduced into parliament, and from thence propagated through the whole nation; and then if the king has but money enough, or lucrative places and offices enough at his disposal, which a corrupt parliament will always take care to provide for him, he becomes, without his designing it, as absolute as if he had no parliament at all, and may act in a more oppressive manner than any sole monarch can venture to do, because he has the sanction of parliament for every thing he does, and has the principal families in the kingdom en|gaged to justify his measures. Thus, Sir, our king may be made absolute without his having ever en|tertained any design against our liberties; and the poison being once thoroughly diffused, which it may by such a minister's continuing long at the head of the administration, it will then be impossible for the king to support his government without corruption; for when the public interest is considered by no man, or but by a very few, when the whole or a great majority of the people are actuated by nothing but selfish mercenary views, can the king expect to have his government supported by a majority in parlia|ment, let his measures be never so much calculated for the public good, unless&punc; he makes it their private interest to do so? While he can do this, he may expect to reign absolute, and yet according to law;
<PB N="155" REF="013851_0686_0F9E288E19561968">
but the moment he ceases to do this, or ceases being able to do it, he must either put an end to par|liaments, or the parliament will put an end to his reign; for all those who find they cannot make their market of him, will join against him, in hopes of making a better market of his successor. I must therefore think, Sir, we cannot do a better service to our sovereign, than by passing such laws as are neces|sary for putting a stop to the progress of corruption, and reviving a public and disinterested spirit among the people; and as the people have loudly called for some such laws being passed, we cannot take a more proper opportunity for introducing them, because it will confirm and strengthen that spirit which now appears among the people without doors in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avour of our present establishment, and will make them more ready to venture their lives in support of the govern|ment, should any future success of the rebels, or the landing of any foreign troops, make it necessary for us to call for the assistance of their hands as well as their purses. What our ministers may think, Sir, I do not know, having little or no correspon|dence with any of them; but as they enjoy the greatest advantages under our present governmeat, and as the people have so generally shewn themselves zealous for supporting that government, under which they in particular enjoy so many advantages, I am sure: every other man thinks they are in gratitude bound to give satisfaction to the people with regard to those laws which they think so necessary for secu|ring their liberties against the fatal effects of cor|ruption. Therefore I do expect in this session to see a very extraordinary change in the conduct of our ministers. Though in former sessions they have opposed every such law, yet now I hope they will
<PB N="156" REF="013851_0687_0F9E288F4A227B80">
themselves be the introducers and the promoters of every one of those laws which the people have so long called for in vain; and if I should have the pleasure of seeing such a change in their conduct, I make no doubt of having the pleasure to see every one of those bills passed into laws, without any opposition in either house of parliament. These, Sir, are the hopes I conceive from that spirit which has appeared among the people for supporting our present most excellent government, and our present most wise administration. This is the return of gratitude I expect from our ministers, who have always shewn themselves most grateful to those who have served them in this house or at elections; and I hope they will not be less grateful to those who have shewn themselves ready to serve their king and country at a time of such imminent danger. This return, I am sure the people expect; and I think we should take this first opportunity to give them some hopes of their not meeting with a disappointment. As we do not know how soon the rebels may enter <HI>England,</HI> as we do not know how soon an army of foreign troops may be landed amongst us, we ought not in prudence to let slip this first opportunity of convincing the people, that there is nothing they can desire for securing their liberties, but what they may expect from this government, and from this session of parlia|ment. For this reason, Sir, I think it necessary to add something to our address on this occasion. Therefore I have prepared an additional paragraph; and I must humbly move, that it may be added to what the honourable gentleman has been pleased to propose. The additional paragraph I have prepared is in these words.</Q>

<P>LORD <HI>Walpole,</HI> in his speech, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1739, labours to shew, that
<Q>the sovereign's power of rewarding merit is one of the most funda|mental and most useful parts of our constitution:</Q>
[so a learned bishop tells us, in his <HI>Alliance between Church and State,</HI> that an established provision for the clergy is the very foundation-stone of a church. I like those honest men, who fairly own, that money is their great object.]
<Q>There are many sorts of public services</Q>
<PB N="158" REF="013851_0689_0F9E289052F77800">
(says lord <HI>Walpole</HI>)
<Q>which cannot be immediately explained, which it would be inconsistent with the public good to divulge; and yet, if this bill [the pension bill]
<Q>should pass into a law, his majesty could reward no services in any member of the other house without explaining and divulging these services; nay, and putting it in the pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of that house to judge, whether these services deserved such a reward, which might occasion disputes between that house and the crown, and would certainly discourage every member of that house from rendering any secret services to the public.</Q>
[The <HI>Dutch</HI> carry on their government very successfully without this waste of the public money to reward secret services.] This, my lords, would be a great prejudice to our civil government; and the frequent oaths that are to be introduced by this bill would be of the most dan|gerous consequence, not only to our established religion, but even to natural religion itself. In our antient polity, both religious and civil, it was a wise maxim, never to oblige or allow a man to swear in any case where self-interest was concerned, especially when the circumstances of the case were such as made it impossible to convict him of perjury, even though he should be guilty of it; but this maxim seems to be quite overturned by this bill, and, therefore, I am convinced it will introduce amongst us an utter con|tempt of perjury, which is always followed by an utter contempt of religion <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, VI.374.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But will the unrestrained practice of peculation, with|out oaths, be found consistent with religion and mora|lity? Government, we know, never hesitates about exposing the merchant, tradesman, manufacturer, or
<PB N="159" REF="013851_0690_0F9E2891126C8D80">
shipmaster to the danger of perjury for the sake of the revenue.</P>
<P>Some of the tools of power insisted in Mr. <HI>Gordon</HI>'s time, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1722, as he tells us <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">TRACTS, I.335.</NOTE>, that
<Q>matters are come to that pass that we must either receive the pre|tender, or keep him out with bribes and standing armies. That the nation is so corrupt, that there is no governing it by any other means. And, in short, that we must submit to this great evil, to pre|vent a greater; as if any mischief could be more terrible than the highest and most terrible of all mischiefs, universal corruption and a military govern|ment. It is indeed impossible for the subtilty of traitors, the malice of devils, or the cunning and cruelty of our most implacable enemies, to suggest stronger motives for the undermining and overthrow of our excellent establishment, which is built upon the destruction of tyranny, and can stand upon no other bottom. It is madness in extremity, to hope that a government founded upon liberty, and the free choice of the assertors of it, can be supported by other principles; and whoever would maintain it by contrary ones, intends to blow it up, let him alledge what he will. This gives me every day new reasons to believe what I have long suspected; for if ever a question should arise, Whether a nation shall submit to certain ruin, or struggle for a re|medy? these gentlemen well know which side they will chuse, and certainly intend that which they must chuse. I am willing to think, that those im|potent babblers speak not the sense of their superiors, but would make servile court to them from topicks which they abhor. Their superiors must know, that it
<PB N="160" REF="013851_0691_0F9E2891F9B62F68">
is raving and phrenzy to affirm, that a free people can be long governed by impotent terrors, that millions will consent to be ruined by the corrup|tion of a few; or that those few will join in their ruin any longer than the corruption lasts. That every day new and greater demands will rise upon the corruptors; that no revenue, how great soever, will feed the voraciousness of the corrupted; and that every disappointment will make them turn upon the oppressors of their country, and fall into its true interest and their own. That there is no way in nature to preserve a revolution in government but mak|ing the people easy under it, and shewing them their interest in it; and that corruption, bribery, and ter|rors will make no lasting friends, but infinite and implacable enemies; and that the best security of a prince amongst free people, is the affections of his people, which he can always gain by making their interest his own, and by shewing that all his views tend to their good. They will then, as they love themselves, love him, and defend him who defends them. Upon this faithful basis, his safety will be better established, than upon the ambitious and variable leaders of a few legions, who may be cor|rupted, disobliged, or surprized; and often have been so; and hence great revolutions have been brought about, and great nations undone, only by the revolt of single regiments. Shew a nation their interest, and they will certainly fall into it. A whole people can have no ambition but to be go|verned justly, and when they are so, the intrigues and dissatisfactions of particulars will fall upon their own heads. What has any of our former courts ever got by corruption, but to disaffect the people, and weaken themselves? Let us now think of other

<P><Q>That all-beholding eye which controuls the uni|verse, pierces through all disguises, and perceives, that the diffusion of vice through this nation is derived from one source, the corruption of the great; which, promoted by the most assiduous arts, and vindicated by venal eloquence, has, at length, absorbed all regard for the community into the two selfish passions of ambition and avarice. And when the most vigorous effort [by a place-bill] was made to purge that place [the house of commons] which once cleansed, would have transfused its own purity through all orders and degrees of men, did not the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">agitious opposition to that attempt, so essential to the very being of virtue, and solicited by the earnest and universal cry of the whole people, produce an instance of supererogatory prostitution, which drew wonder from a minister? For want of this barrier to confine corruption, honesty has been put up to public sale, and found its price, to the cost of a nation twice betrayed; hence a loose has been given to public profusion, and rapine, unchecked, and unchastised; and the illicit gains have been as profusely squander|ed by individuals, in luxury, sensuality, and every unmanly gratification; and hence the means of obtaining these ignominious emoluments have been purchased by involving the nation in perjury, treachery, and a general dissolution of manners <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gord.</HI> TRACTS, II.269.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P><Q>It is true, an honest and wise minister, who ob|serves this conduct, and is more frugal for the pub|lic than in his own private affairs, cannot avoid raising many enemies. In a bad age it is a virtue not without its dangers.

They who would steal the golden apples, will hate the watchful eyes that are upon them; and he who undertakes this post, is to expect that secret malice will be working in the dark to undermine him: Perhaps he may be pursued by the most interested part of mankind with open clamours. Advantages will be taken of the least trip he makes. He must look for traverses, to be traduced, and to have his actions scanned and misinterpreted. However, let him persevere, for if a state be not quite devoted to ruin, he who acts thus uprightly for it, and with such care, will overcome all difficulties; and the wisdom and justice of his counsels will, at last, meet with universal approbation <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 425.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P>In the year 1711, when the tories were endea|vouring to overturn the whig administration, which had reduced the power of <HI>France</HI> so low, and were projecting the infamous treaty of <HI>Utrecht, Burnet</HI> says, They finding the house of lords could not be brought to favour their designs, resolved to make an expe|riment, which none of our princes ventured upon in former times; a resolution was taken of making twelve peers at once. What has been the conduct of the minister under similar circumstances? has he not advised the creation of sixteen new peerages, not, indeed, at once; that would have been too explicit a declaration of his motives, but all in the space of two years; and not content with
<PB N="165" REF="013851_0696_0F9E2896714DC7C8">
this, he has likewise advised the giving pensions to a great number of that house, under the denomina|tion, indeed, of lords of the bed-chamber; but as the number of these lords has been increased in the present reign from twelve to twenty-two, the fact is, that by what ever name they are called, the king has so many more servants in his pay in that house, and the m&mdash;has the rod of deprivation hanging over their heads, which has lately fallen most heavily upon those who have presumed to exercise their free|dom of voting against what he recommended. But in the other house, and where it is more mate|rial, this measure has been carried much farther. We are informed by history, that from the time of the revolution, it has been the characteristic mark of those who opposed any increase of power in the crown to contrive by-laws, and every other method, to prevent the influence of the crown in that house. Several acts of parliament have been passed to limit the number of officers who received their places from the crown, to have seats in the house of com|mons, and one particularly during the whig admi|nistration of queen <HI>Anne,</HI> which declares that no person possessed of an office, created after such a period, should be capable of a seat in that house; and this was afterwards enforced by another of 1 <HI>Geo.</HI> I. which was proposed by Mr. <HI>Stanhope,</HI> secretary of state, and restrained persons having pensions dur|ing pleasure, from sitting in the house of commons. These laws were passed to be a restraint on the crown, they are now in force, and mean to provide for the liberty of the people, by preventing the crown from creating a dependance upon it in the representatives: but, like other human institutions, they have been evaded; when a minister shall pre|sume
<PB N="166" REF="013851_0697_0F9E2897136BB5D0">
to advise, in the teeth of those acts of par|liament, the creation of such a number of grooms of the bed-chamber, clerks of the green cloth, and other officers of the houshold, each with a salary of 500<HI>l. per annum,</HI> as to be double the number of these of his late majesty; and when some gentle|men have been removed from these employments with pensions, to make room for members of the house of commons, that the law might be only evaded, not openly violated; and when we see gentlemen of the first fortunes, and who have the two last reigns prided themselves in their indepen|dency, eagarly and meanly thrusting themselves into this pitiful pension; I say, when we consider these things, where is the security of laws, or upon what principles of the constitution can these measures be defended? The reason, I understand, the minister gives for pursuing this measure, is the union of parties; the larger the source of bounty in the crown, the more general will be its dues. This may be plausible reasoning, but the fact is, and of this I confess myself jealous, that by these pensions, the crown has increased its influence in the house of commons; and with regard to the act of queen <HI>Anne,</HI> if a list of new erected places should, as was done the beginning of the late reign, be ordered to be laid upon the table of the house of commons, I cannot see but that those of the supernumerary offices of the houshold must be of the number; otherwise the crown may, in any future emergency, create as many as shall then be found necessary to answer the pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">poses of the minister <NOTE PLACE="foot">CATO'S LETT.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Bills, Statutes, Resolutions, &amp;c. shewing the Sense of Mankind on the Evil of Placemen and Pensioners in Parliament.</HEAD>
<P><Q>THE general principle, says the author of the DISSERTATION UPON PARTIES, p. 198. That parliaments ought to be independent on the crown, hath not only been always the same, but it hath been always so declared in the most authentic and solemn manner; and parliaments have not been more intent on any national concern whatever, than on maintaining this principle, and securing the ef|fects of it. I say, parliaments have been constantly thus intent, and especially in the best times, during more than three centuries at least; for I would not go back too far, nor grope unnecessarily in the dark. What else did those laws mean, that were made in the time of the <HI>Lancaster</HI> kings to regulate the elec|tions, and to prevent the influence, which <HI>Rich.</HI> II. had illegally and arbitrarily employed, and which there was room to fear that other princes might employ? What else do all those resolutions, all those acts of parliament mean, that have been made so
<PB N="169" REF="013851_0700_0F9E289B38B0D140">
often, and enforced so strongly from time to time, and from those days to these, against the influence of the crown, either on the elections, or on the mem|bers of parliament?</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is another question which I must ask. If this be so, what do these men mean, who are em|ployed, or rather what does he mean
[<HI>Walpole</HI>] who employs them, to plead in all places and on all occasions, even the most solemn, in favour of this very influence, nay of the very worst sort of it; of that influence which is created immediately by cor|ruption; for to that their arguments reach, by unde|niable consequence. Reason is against him and them, since it is a plain absurdity to suppose a controul on the crown, (and they have not yet ven|tured to suppose the contrary that I know of) and to establish at the same time a power and even a right in the crown to render this controul useless. Expe|rience is against them, since the examples of other countries, and at some times (former times I mean) of our own, have proved that a prince may govern according to his arbitrary will, or that of his mere arbitrary minister, as absolutely, and much more securely <HI>with,</HI> than <HI>without</HI> the concurrence of a parliament. Authority, even the uniform authority of our whole legislature is against them. The voice of our law gives them the lye. How then shall we account for this proceeding; this open and despe|rate attack upon our constitution, and therefore upon our liberty? Have these great men made any nice discovery that escaped the sagacity of our ancestors, and is above the narrow conceptions of all other men except themselves at this time? Is it less fit now, than the wisdom of this nation hath judged it to be for so many ages, that kings should govern

<P>So early as <HI>A. D.</HI> 1375, the commons were sensi|ble of the necessity of a place-bill. For in that year, they petitioned the king, that no member for county, or city, be a collector of taxes <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST. I.337.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The sense of our ancestors on pluralities, and incom|patible places, appears by an act made, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1413.

<P>On occasion of the king's attorney being elected a member, <HI>A.

That, 7. <HI>Rich.</HI> II. a knight banneret was put out of the house. Sir <HI>Thomas More,</HI> who had been himself chancellor, and speaker, says,
<Q>The eye of a courtier can endure no colour, but one; the king's livery dazzling his sight.</Q>
He compares them to clouds gilded by the sun's rays, and to brass coin, which the king's stamp makes current.

<P><HI>A. D.</HI> 1643, an attempt toward a place-bill was made. There was no great want of it in those days, the court having few places to dispose of. Yet <HI>Ch.</HI> I. tells his <HI>Oxford</HI> parliament, that most of them were in his service. This probably gave rise to the self-deny|ing ordinance <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<P>The self-denying ordinance, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1645. was a signal exhibition, and <HI>instar omnium,</HI> of the sense of parliament, on this subject. It enacts by the authority of lords and commons, that all members of both houses be at the end of 40 days discharged from holding any place, civil or military, granted by parliament since <HI>Nov.</HI> 1640. All other officers, commanders, &amp;c. to continue as before.

He ex|patiates on a pensioners breach of trust; his pocketing what is given by the people for the necessary charges of government. He observes, that receiving a pension is plundering the people, and distressing the king, and putting him and his ministry on wicked shifts, to satisfy a set of blood-suckers, which is endless; for the more the court gives, the more it must go on to give. That it naturally leads a king to think hardly of the most faithful counsellors, and incorrupt parlia|ments, who restrain the boundless waste of the public money. That it lays us open to our enemies abroad by exhausting our treasure, which should arm us against them, and disables us for paying our heavy debts. He observes, that the pensioners of the pension-parliament called themselves the king's friends, and so they do now. That endeavours were used, but ineffectually, about 10 <HI>Rich.</HI> II. to get a corrupt par|liament<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 150.</NOTE>. That there was another unsuccessful at|tempt about <HI>A. D.</HI> 1459, or 60. That about 20 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. many of the king's dependents were in the house.

<P>A debate in the house of commons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1689, about excluding placemen from thence, proved warm and obstinate. Carried for the placemen, because

This parliament was called the officers parliament, from the great number of them in the house. The people began to be afraid of falling under military government.

<Q>It seemed to establish (they said) an opposition between the crown and the people, as if those who were employed by one, could not be trusted by the other.</Q>
And who can deny this? The very idea of a representative should be, one wholly detached from every connexion with all but his constituents. Can a representative be too free? Another employment is many times inconsistent with a seat in the house. An officer ought to be keeping his men in order.

Is not parliamentary privi|lege enough for one person to hold, without his having a place and pension besides? Have not the nobility and the court power enough, without lording it in the house of commons too? What good or lawful design can a king or minister have, in giving a place to a member?

The bill was once likely to be carried, postponing some of the lords amendments, [<HI>i. e.</HI> their amendments the wrong way] but the court party being reinforced by some coming round, who used to be on the contrary side, [bribed most probably] the lords amendments were approved with a few alterations, to which the lords agreed <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 454.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A. D.</HI> 1704. To mortify some members, who had taken places, a bill was brought in

Passed the commons immediately, but the lords (who had nothing to do with it) must go to tinkering it, and the commons not liking (as they had not much reason) their amendments, the bill was lost. There was likewise another bill, immediately after, set on foot by the commons, <Q>to prevent persons entitled by their offices to receive any benefit by public an|nual taxes, to be granted, from being members of parliament: which being levelled against many brave and deserving members, who serv'd the nation by sea and land, occasioned some murmurs; to stifle

<P>A bill was brought into the <HI>Scotch</HI> parliament for securing the succession, in case of queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s death. It proposed among other things, that no person shall have a vote in regulating the succession, who has any place, mediately, or immediately, under the crown. That all election be by ballot. A lesser baron to be ad|ded to parliament, for every new created nobleman, to balance the two houses. The crown not to have the power of making peace and war without parliament.

<P>A general self-denying bill was offered, <HI>A.

Now the scene was a little altered. They saw they were not like to be favou|rites, and therefore pretended to be patriots. This
<PB N="182" REF="013851_0713_0F9E28AA7B142D10">
looked so strangely in them, that it was rejected, but another bill of a more restrained nature passed, dis|abling certain officers from serving in parliament.' To this a general clause was added, which disabled all who held any office created since <HI>A. D.</HI> 1684, or any in future. Passed readily the commons. The lords thought it too comprehensive. Altered it to some particular disabilities. The commons refuse their alterations. The excellent bill drops.

<P>It was resolved, <HI>A.

<P>A bill (formerly often attempted) for disabling members from holding places, was brought into the

tory parliament, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1711; but dropped. The qualification of 600<HI>l.</HI> a year, for a knight of the shire, and 300<HI>l.</HI> for a burgess, passed.

<P>The bill for limiting the number of placemen in the house of commons was brought in and passed, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1712.
<Q>The scandal of corruption was thought to be more flagrant than ever; for it was believed that men were not only bribed for a whole session, but had new bribes for particular votes.</Q></P>
<P>Bill for securing freedom of parliaments, by limit|ing the number of placemen in the house, read a se|cond time, and committed.

Passes in the negative, 160 against III <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. V.12.</NOTE>.

<P>The self denying bill was brought into the house of commons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1712, and passed. Many of the lords being irritated at the late creation of twelve new peers at once, it was expected it would pass their house too. But their lordships seemed suddenly to alter their way of thinking of it; and whereas it was drawn to take place after the present parliament, they altered it, to take place after the death of the queen; so that it was no more thought of <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burn.</HI> IV.363</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="013851_0715_0F9E28AD3AC0D138">The commons resolved themselves into a commitee of the whole house, <HI>A.

A motion made for an address to the king against them [because we have no share].

<P><HI>A. D.</HI> 1728, the famous self-denying bill passed the commons, which provided, that no member should sit, till he had taken an oath, that he had no pension
<PB N="185" REF="013851_0716_0F9E28AD93309130">
during pleasure, or for any number of years, nor any office in part, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in whole, from the crown, held by any person for his benefit, and that he would not re|ceive any such emolument, during the time of his being a member, without giving notice to the house within 14 days after accepting the same, if parliament was sitting, or after its first sitting, on pain of wil|ful perjury, and incapacity of holding any office. Whoever refused, or neglected taking the oath, was to lose his seat, and forfeit 30<HI>l.</HI> each day he sate with|out taking the oath. It would have been very bare|faced for the commons to have refused this bill; for it only enacted, that no member should be a court-tool without leave of the house. But, as the bill, if it had passed into a law, might have been trouble|some, it was contrived, that it should be thrown out by the lords.</P>
<P>It was now the opinion of the public, and not without foundation, <Q>that the minister [<HI>Walpole</HI>] suf|fered the pension-bill to pass in the house of com|mons, only because he knew it would be thrown out in the house of lords <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tind.</HI> CONTIN. VIII.101.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The following is the oath to be taken by members, if the pension-bill, passed, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1731, by the com|mons, and rejected by the lords, had passed into a law;
<Q>I, <HI>A. B.</HI> do solemnly and sincerely swear, that I have not, directly or indirectly, any pension during pleasure, or for any number of years, from the crown, nor any office in part, or in the whole, from the crown, held for me, or for my benefit, by any person whatsoever. And I do solemnly and sincerely promise and swear that I will not receive,
<PB N="186" REF="013851_0717_0F9E28AE589DCDB8">
accept, or take, directly or indirectly, during the time of my being a member of this parliament, any pension during pleasure, or for any number of years, or any other gratuity or reward whatever, &amp;c. with|out signifying the same to this house, within fourteen days after I have received or accepted the same, if the parliament be then sitting, or within fourteen days after the next meeting of the parliament. So help me God <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. VIII. Append.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Any member taking the oath, if found to have had a pension at the time, during pleasure, or for any number of years, &amp;c. [as in the oath] without sig|nifying the same to the house, was to be held guilty of perjury, and to suffer accordingly. Any member refusing to take the oath, was to lose his seat; or sitting and voting, through oversight of the house, to forfeit 30 <HI>l.</HI> each day, and to be incapacitated for holding any office, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A motion was made in the house of peers, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1730, to call for a list of pensions payable by the crown. Passes in the negative <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, IV.29.</NOTE>. Several lords pro|tested, Because no instance can be given, that the list of pensioners was denied, when called for by either house.
<Q>Because we conceive, the refusal will be misinterpreted without doors, as it will raise a jea|lousy that there are too many members upon the list, which aspersion ought to have been obviated, by pro|ducing those lists, as in former times has been fre|quently done.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A. D.</HI> 1731, it was moved in the house of com|mons, that a committee be appointed to enquire,
<Q>whether any members of this house have, directly
<PB N="187" REF="013851_0718_0F9E28AF150B2560">
or indirectly, any pensions during pleasure, or for any number of years, or any offices from the crown, held on trust for them in part, or in the whole <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tind.</HI> CONTIN. VIII.101.</NOTE>.</Q>
<HI>Walpole</HI> said, this was turning the house of commons into a court of inquisition: That if it was made effec|tual, it would oblige members to accuse themselves <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. This, however, was trifling; for enquiry might have been made, and discoveries gained, as in all other cases of roguery, by means entirely consistent with liberty and the constitution.</P>
<P><HI>Sandys</HI> moves, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1731, for a committee to en|quire whether any member had any pension, directly or indirectly, during pleasure, or for years, or any office from the crown, holden in trust for him in part or whole <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. VII.81.</NOTE>. This motion was vigorously opposed, though the pension-bill met with no opposition. It was carried in the negative, 206 to 143.</P>
<P>They did not choose, I suppose, to have it known what knaves they were. So a prudent pickpocket, being accused of purloining a missing watch in the company, where he was; declared himself very willing to purge himself by <HI>oath</HI>; but strongly refused standing the <HI>search.</HI> It was observed, however, on that occasion, that many members suspected to be on the black list, voted for the enquiry, to save appear|ances, well knowing that it would not proceed.</P>
<P>A motion was made in the house of peers, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1732, for restraining officers concerned in the salt-duty from interposing in elections. Passed in the negative; though the same is established with respect to other duties. Nineteen lords protested, because the officers of the customs are immensely numerous, and
<PB N="188" REF="013851_0719_0F9E28B0189B2DD8">
have a prodigious influence in elections <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, IV.85, <HI>et seq.</HI></NOTE>. They form a second standing army, and often supply the place of the other, whose attendance at an election would be too gross a violation of the law. A house of commons influenced by the servants of the crown (it is observed by their lordships) might be
<Q>a representative of an <HI>administration,</HI> or of a <HI>minister;</HI> but could no longer be a true representative of the <HI>people.</HI></Q>
Parliaments are so great a check on ministers, that they have always endeavoured either to enable the crown to govern without them, or to influence their elections, or to corrupt them so thoroughly, that their efficiency shall be lost. The antiquity of the statutes for preventing these evils, shews how early they begun to prevail. There is little danger, since the revolution, of any attempt to govern without parliaments.
<Q>The wisdom of this house has seemed, by rejecting the pension-bill three times successively, to think the laws already in force sufficient to prevent corruption in the mem|bers, but the influence of the servants of the crown in elections, must, in our opinion, be looked upon as a growing danger, whose consequences require the utmost watchfulness to prevent them, as the great multitude of the tax-gatherers are solely directed by the treasury. The number of these creatures of the court was too great before; and by the new estab|lishment of this duty, it is to be increased, and, at the same time, no restraint laid on their power, which is the more dangerous, as it does no violence openly to parliaments; but operates secretly, silently, and securely.</Q></P>

Truth and reason will prevail at last; which encouraged him again to renew this motion; that the bill was ready, and he desired leave to bring it up. It was objected, That it was a new sort of motion to ask leave to <HI>bring up</HI> a bill. That the constant custom had been to move for <HI>leave to bring in</HI> a bill.

<P><Q>The remembrance of the excise scheme and the convention was revived [<HI>A.

<P>It was ordered, the same year, that leave be given to bring in a bill for making more effectual the laws for disabling persons from being chosen members of or sitting or voting in the house of commons, who have any pension during pleasure, or for any number of years, or any office held in trust for them <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<HI>A. D.</HI> 1741. Moved to commit it. Passes in the negative.</P>
<P>Several lords protested, because they conceived that the constitution points out this bill as one of its principal securities to preserve the independency of the three several constituent parts of the supreme legisla|tive power; for if any one of these becomes dependent on the other, the constitution is dangerously altered: But if any two become dependent on the third, it is to|tally subverted, and the wisest establishment that ever was formed of a free government, shrinks and dege|nerates into a monarchical, an aristocratical, or demo|cratical faction; and should the number of employ|ments continue to increase, we may live to see a con|stant majority of placemen, meeting under the name of a parliament to establish grievances instead of redress|ing them; and because the freedom of parliament is not secured, by the law, which obliges a member who accepts a place to quit his seat, since experience shews, that he will be constantly re-elected. They observed, with concern, that a bill of this nature, had been thrice rejected by the commons.

If this question could have been carried, it would have been productive of great advantage to the constitution, as the influence of the crown in elections is very alarming indeed: many sea-port boroughs are almost entirely carried by the numbers of little places the court disposes of there; and even in cities and counties the antiministerial candidate feels the power of the crown an heavy weight against him. <Q>We are not surprized at the court's carrying the question, but a good deal so, that the country gentlemen, who have so long been exclaiming against the undue influence of the crown, should join with them in this vote<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 231.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<PB N="193" REF="013851_0724_0F9E28B516047598">
it must often be difficult, if not impossible, for the house to prove, that a member has accepted a place (most of them being sinecures,) that therefore the house had a right to demand of the person, so charged, a categorical answer.
<Q>As the ministry durst not give a flat negative to the proposal, the words of the act being pretty clear, they were reduced to the chicane, that legal proof was not before the house.

Sir, The last house of commons being sensible how narrowly this nation escaped being ruined by a sort of monsters, called Pensioners, who sat in the late long parliament, had entered into a consideration how to prevent the like from coming into future parliaments; and in order thereto re|solved, that they would severely chastise some of those that had been guilty, and make the best laws they could to prevent the like for the future; and for that purpose a committee was appointed, of which Mr. Sergeant <HI>Gregory,</HI> now Judge <HI>Gregory,</HI> was chairman, by which many papers relating to that affair came to his hands. Sir, I think it a business of so great importance, that it never ought to be forgotten, nor the prosecution of it deferred. I have often heard, that <HI>England</HI> can never be de|stroyed but by itself; to have such parliaments was the most likely way that ever yet was invented. I remember a great lawyer said in this house, when it was debated in the last parliament, that it was <HI>trea|son</HI>;
<PB N="196" REF="013851_0727_0F9E28B76AD1D678">
and he gave many learned arguments to make it out. Whether it be so or no, I will not now offer to debate; but I think, for those that are the legislators of the nation to take bribes, to under|mine the laws and government of this nation, that they ought to be chastised as <HI>traitors.</HI> It was my fortune to sit here a little while in the long parlia|ment; I did observe that all those that had pen|sions, and most of those that had offices, voted all of a side, as they were directed by some great officer, as exactly as if their business in this house had been to preserve their pensions and offices, and not to make laws for the good of them that had sent them hither. How such persons could any way be useful for the support of the government, by preserving a fair understanding between the king and the people, or rather how likely to bring in arbitrary power and popery, I leave to every man's judgment. They were so far from being the true representatives of the people, that they were a distinct interest from both king and people; and their chief business was to serve the ends of some great minister of state, though ever so opposite to the true interest of the nation. Sir, this business ought never to fall (though there should be ever so many prorogations and dissolutions of parliaments) before something be done in it; I think it is the interest of the nation that it should be prosecuted from parliament as if there were an impeachment against them. And therefore, Sir, I would humbly move you to send some members of this house to Judge <HI>Gregory</HI> for the papers he hath in his custody relating to this affair, that so you may in convenient time proceed farther herein, as you shall think good. And, Sir, being there is a report that some of this house have now
<PB N="197" REF="013851_0728_0F9E28B99ECDA2A8">
made a bargain at court for great offices, in order to vitiate and corrupt their votes in this house; which, though but a project to cast a reflection on such members, however, to satisfy the world, I pray, Sir, let there be a vote past that no member of this house shall accept of any office under the crown du|ring such time as he continues a member of this house.</Q></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Mulgrave</HI> in the house of peers, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1692, spoke as follows on the subject of placemen in parlia|ment.</P>
<P><Q>My lords, I beseech you to consider the meaning of that word representative. Can representatives do any thing contrary to the mind of their constituents? It would be absurd to propose it: And yet how can it be otherwise, if representatives, after being chosen, may change their dependency, and engage themselves in employments plainly inconsistent with the great trust reposed in them? And that I will take the liberty to demonstrate to your lordships they now do, at least according to my conception of the matter. I will instance first in the least or lowest incapacity they must be under who so take employments. Your lordships must know but too well what a general carelessness there appears every day more and more in the public business; if so, how is it likely that men should be as diligent in their duty in parliament as that business requires, when employments and other business shall take up both their minds and their time? But then, in some cases, it is worse, as in commands of the army and other employments of that kind, when they must have a divided duty: for it does admirably become an officer to sit voting away money in the house of commons, while his soldiers are perhaps taking it away at their quarters
<PB N="198" REF="013851_0729_0F9E28BB379C6B70">
for want of his presence to restrain them, and of better discipline among them. Nay, perhaps his troop or regiment may be in some action abroad, and he must either have the shame of being absent from them at such a time, or from that house where he is intrusted with our liberties. To this I have heard but one objection by a noble lord, <HI>viz.</HI> That if this act should pass, the king is not allowed to make a captain a colonel without disabling him to sit in parliament. Truly, if a captain has only deserved to be advanced for exposing himself in par|liament, I think the nation would have no great loss in the king's letting alone such a preferment. But, my lords, there is another sort of incapacity yet worse than this; I mean that of parliament-mens having such places in the exchequer, the very profit of which depends on the money given to the king in parliament. Would any of your lordships send and entrust a man to make a bargain for you, whose very interest shall be to make you give as much as he possibly can? It puts me in mind of a farce where an actor holds a dialogue with himself, speaking first in one tone, and then answering in another. Really, my lords, this is no farce. It is no laughing matter to undo a nation; but it is altogether as unnatural for a member of parliament to ask first in the king's name for such a supply, give an account from him how much is needful toward the paying such an army, or such a fleet, and then immediately give by his ready vote what he had before asked by his masters's order. Besides, my lords, there is such a necessity now for long sessions of parliament; and the very privileges belonging to members are of so great extent, that it would be a little hard and unequal to
<PB N="199" REF="013851_0730_0F9E28BC7B2EC990">
other gentlemen that members should have all the places besides.</Q></P>
<P><Q>All the objections that have been made may be re|duced to these: First; it is told us, that it is a dis|respect to the king, that his servants or officers should be excluded the house. To this I desire it may be considered, that it is in this case as when a tenant sends up a person to treat for him: Would any of your lordships think it a disrespect; nay, would the king himself think it any, if the tenant would not wholly referr himself to one of your own servants, or the king's commissioners in the case of the crown? And if he chuses rather some plain honest friend of his own to supply his absence here, will any man blame such a proceeding, or think it unmannerly? Another objection is, That this act may by its con|sequence prolong this parliament, which they allow would be a very great grievance; and yet suppose the king capable of putting it upon us, which I have too much respect for him to admit of; though I am glad, however, that it is objected by privy counsellors in favour, who consequently I hope will never advise a thing which they now exclaim at as so great a grievance. But pray, my lords, what should tempt the king to so ill a policy? Can he fear a freedom of choice in the people, to whose good will he owes all his power, which these lords suppose he may use to their prejudice? Give me leave to say, as I must not suspect him of so ill a design as the perpetuating this parliament, so he cannot, he ought not, to suspect a nation so entirely, I was going to say so fondly de|voted to him. My lords, no man is readier than myself to allow that we owe the crown all submission as to the time of calling parliaments according to law, and appointing also where they shall sit. But
<PB N="200" REF="013851_0731_0F9E28BCA071EC68">
with reverence be it spoken, the king owes the nation entire freedom in chusing their representatives; and it is no less his duty than it is his true interest that such a fair and just proceeding should be used towards us. Consider, my lords, of what mighty conse|quence it may be, that so many votes should be free, when upon one single vote may depend the whole security or loss of this nation. By one single vote such points may be ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ried as I almost tremble to think of. By one single vote a general excise may be granted; and then we are all lost. By one single vote the crown may he impowered to name all the commissioners for raising the taxes; and then, surely, we should be in a fair way towards it. Nay, what|ever has happened may again be apprehended; and I hope those reverend prelates will reflect, that if they grow once obnoxious to a prevalent party, one single voice may be as dangerous to that bench, as a general dissatisfaction among the people proved to be once in a late experience: which I am far from saying by way of threatening, and mean it only by way of caution. My Lords, we may think because this concerns not the house of lords, that we need not be so over careful of the matter; but there are noblemen in <HI>France,</HI> at least such as were so before they were enslaved, who that they might domineer over others, and serve a present turn perhaps, let all things alone so long till the people were quite mas|tered, and the nobility themselves too, to bear them company. So that I never met a <HI>Frenchman</HI> even of the greatest rank (and some had 10,000 pistoles a year in employments) that did not envy us here for our freedom from that slavery which they groan under; and this I have observed universally, excepting Mon|sieur <HI>de Louvois,</HI> Monsieur <HI>Colbert,</HI> or such people,
<PB N="201" REF="013851_0732_0F9E28BD58387468">
because they were the ministers themselves who occa|sioned these complaints, and throve by the oppressing of others.</Q></P>

<P><Q>Let us see</Q>
(says that judicious writer)
<Q>whether a house of commons full of officers and court-pen|sioners will answer those noble and laudable ends of their constitution. And here indeed I begin already to be ashamed of my undertaking; the proof of the negative is so ridiculous, that it looks too much like a jest to ask any one in his wits, whether a parlia|ment filled with delinquents will ever call themselves to an account, or what account will be given if they should? Whether an assembly of public robbers will sentence one another to be punished, or to make resti|tution? Whether it is possible our grievances can be redressed that are committed by persons from whom there is no higher power to appeal? whether there is any hope of justice, where the malefactors are the judges? Whether his majesty can be rightly informed in affairs relating to himself or the public, when they are represented to him only by such persons who design to abuse him? Whether the public ac|counts will be faithfully inspected by those, who embezzle our money to their own use? Whether the king's prerogative can be lawfully maintained by such who only pervert it to their own sinister ends and purposes? Whether a parliament can be a true balance where all the weight is only in one scale? Or lastly, Whether a house of commons can vote freely, who are either prepossessed with the hopes and

promises of enjoying places, or the slavish fears of losing them?</Q></P>
<P>The same writer goes on <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">STATE TRACTS, time of king <HI>William,</HI> II, 637.</NOTE> faithfully to alarm his country against what was in those bashful days very alarming, because it was new. In our times (the present always excepted) as hackneyed wh&mdash;s thieves, murderers, and the like, are proof against shame, we read and hear arguments every day gravely brought in defence, or at least in alleviation of the very prac|tice which alone can, and must ruin liberty, if it has not already.</P>
<P><Q>Here I must confess there are not many instances to be given; the project of corrupting parliaments being but of late date, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> practice first set on foot within the compass of our own memories, as the last and most dangerous stratagem that ever was invented by an encroaching king, to possess him|self of the rights of a free born people; I mean <HI>Ch.</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. who, well remembering with how little suc|cess both he and his father had made use of open arms and downright violence, to storm and bat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er down the bulwarks of our excellent constitution, had recourse, at last, to these mean arts and under|hand practices of bribing and corrupting with mo|ney those who were entrusted with the conservation of our laws, and the guardianship of our liberties. And herein he so well succeeded, that the mischiefs and calamities occasioned by that mercenary parlia|ment, did not terminate with his life and reign; but the effects of them are continued and handed down, and sensibly felt by the nation to this very hour.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="013851_0734_0F9E28BEDAD44940">The same judicious writer goes on <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">STATE TRACTS, time of King <HI>William,</HI> II.641.</NOTE> to observe, that the parliament which succeeded to the pensioned parli|ament, was, fortunately for the nation, composed of different men, who accordingly pursued different mea|sures. That <HI>Iames</HI> II. was greatly advantaged in his designs against liberty, by having a way paved for him by the pensioned parliament. That he did not succeed in his laudable endeavours, to corrupt his parliament. That, accordingly he was precipitated from the throne, and driven, with his execrable race, into perpetual banishment from his country, which made way for the revolution. That the revolution did not produce the expected advantages, because its effect was blasted by corruption in parliament.
<Q>We were filled, (says he <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 640.</NOTE>)
<Q>with golden dreams, not only of a bare security for our estates and lives; but an inexhausted affluence of all manner of bles|sings, a nation is capable of enjoying. But tho</Q>
we have dreamt the dreams, yet we have not seen the visions. And the nation is by this time sadly sensible how wretchedly they have fallen short of their expected happiness, yet are they not all ac|quainted with the true spring and fountain from whence all their misfortunes flow, which is indeed no other than that bare faced and openly avowed corrup|tion, which, like an universal leprosy, has so notoriously infected and overspread both our court and parliament. 'Tis from hence are plainly derived all the calami|ties and distractions under which the whole nation at present groans: 'tis this that has changed the very natures of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and of valiant men made them cowards, of eloquent dumb, and of honest men

villains. 'Tis this can make a whole house of com|mons eat their own words, and countervote what they had just before resolved on: 'tis this could summon the mercenary members from all quarters of the town in an instant, to vote their fellow cri|minals innocent: 'tis this that can make the parli|ament throw away the people's money with the utmost profusion, without enquiring into the ma|nagement of it: 'tis this that put a stop to the exa|mination of that scandalous escape of the <HI>Toulon</HI> fleet into <HI>Brest</HI>: 'tis this that has incouraged the mis|management of the admiralty in relation to the loss of so vast a number of men of war and merchant ships, as well as other miscarriages which were by all men judged not to proceed from their want of understanding in sea affairs: 'tis this that has hin|dered the passing a bill so often brought into the house for incapacitating members to bear offices: 'tis this that could not only indemnify, but honour a leading member for his audacious procuring and accepting a grant of lands, which, by the parlia|ment, had been set apart for the public service; a vote that shall stand recorded in their own journals to the never dying infamy of that mercenary assem|bly: 'tis this could make the same person most con|fidently affirm, that he was sure the majority of the house would agree to what he was going to propose: 'tis this that could make men of peaceable disposi|tions and considerable estates, vote for a standing army: 'tis this that could bring admirals to confess that our fleet under their command, was no security to us: 'tis this could make wise men act against their own apparent interest. In short, 'tis this that has infatuated our prudence, staggered our con|stancy, sullied our reputation, and introduced a

Bribery is indeed so sure and unavoidable a way to destroy any nation, that we may all sit down and wonder that so much as the very name of a free government is yet continued to us.

<P>The same patriotic writer observes <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">STATE TRACTS, time of king <HI>William,</HI> II.653.</NOTE>, that <Q>the ex|ecutive power ought not to be lodged in the house of commons, because it would deprive the kingdom of that which is the noblest and most useful work of their representatives, the calling ill ministers to account, and the preserving a steady administration in the subordinate officers of the government.</Q> But in a house of commons abounding with officers, if any one of them be attacked, it alarms the whole fraternity, and they all engage to bring him off, though it be by the scandalous way of putting the question for candles, and carrying it in the negative. This was the case of the admiralty last parliament, and may be of the treasury this sessions, if fortune proves so propitious, that one of their members be made speaker. This point gained, the next will probably be to establish the army, and then to sus|pend or repeal the triennial act.</P>

This is
<PB N="207" REF="013851_0738_0F9E28C291EFF6F8">
a thought which deserves our most serious reflections. I could name a certain gentleman, who exactly re|sembles <HI>Hen. Guy,</HI> who the last sessions&punc; when the house was a little out of humour, disposed of no less than sixteen thousand pounds in three days time for secret service. Who are in places we may find out, but God knows who have pensions, yet every man, that made the least observation, can remember, that some who opened loudly at the beginning of the last sessions, who came up as eagar as it is possible for reformation, had their mouths soon stopped with hush-money. It has been of some time whispered, that if this will not at first pre-engage to do what will be exacted at their hands, we shall have a par|liament. I cannot tell whether a new parliament will not be practised upon by the <HI>Carmarthen</HI> art; how|ever, it is our last and best remedy: for if this con|tinues, God have mercy upon poor <HI>England.</HI> Hitherto we have been, and we are like, for ought I see, to be repaid for all our expences of blood and treasure, with the smoke whch <HI>Boccalini</HI> mentions in his ad|vices from <HI>Parnassus,</HI> whereby the enemies of the government have but too great advantage given them to ridicule us for our foolish credulity?</Q></P>
<P><Q>If men are to make fortunes by being of our senate house, says the same gentleman <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">STATE TRACTS, time of king <HI>William,</HI> II.370.</NOTE>, we had better ourselves pay the disbursements of those we send, we had better ourselves allow them plentiful salaries for sitting there; each particular county would save by it in the public assessments, and find their account in it, whilst they preserve their mem|bers from the temptation, of being hired out of their interest, and consequently get good laws for what
<PB N="208" REF="013851_0739_0F9E28C44FED83C0">
they give. We can scarce pay too much for good laws, and if we have not some that we have not yet, we shall not, when the war is over (let it end which way it will) be able to call what we have our own. In the late times, the city of <HI>London</HI> often petitioned for passing of laws: will they always lend money now, and never expect a thorough alteration of the ministry, and securities for the future, against court projectors? In <HI>Iames</HI> Ist's time, there were certain sparks, who undertook for parliaments, that were called undertakers; and there is a certain secret that has stole out of our cabinet, that one of these, im|mediately on the king's refusing the triennial bill last sessions, undertook that it should be thrown out the next time they sat, with as much scorn and contempt as was the judges bill. It is time to have annual par|liaments instead of triennial, since privy counsellors and lords of the treasury, (both which stations this person enjoys) can so perfectly feel the pulse of a par|liament during an interval.</Q></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles Sedley</HI> in his speech, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1699, thus sets forth the danger from placemen in parliament.
<Q>I believe, Mr. Speaker, when we come to consider of it, we shall find that it is convenient not only to lessen the officers of the court and state in point of profit, but in point of number to. We have nine commi|ssioners of excise, seven of the admiralty, three of the post-office, six of the customs. I know not why half may not do the business as well. But when I consider, that all these, or most of them, are members of parliament, my wonder is over; for though it may be a dispute whether many heads are better than one, 'tis certainly true, that m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y votes are better than one. Many of these gentlemen have two offices besides their seat in parliament, which re|quire
<PB N="209" REF="013851_0740_0F9E28C56AFC2680">
attendance in several places, and abilities of divers natures; but members of parliament, though well principled, have no privilege to be fit for any thing they please to undertake without practice, study, or application. Sir, we are called by the king, and sent up by the people; and ought to regard no interests but theirs, which, as I told you before, are always the same: let us therefore proceed accord|ingly. The late proposals of the courtiers them|selves to save the king money was, by applying the profits, salaries, and fees of their places that exceed 800 <HI>l. per annum,</HI> to the war. Thus will the pub|lic charge lie easier upon the people, and the present reign be more and more endeared to them. What is necessary we shall chearfully supply, when we see all men set their shoulders to the burden, and stand upon an equal footing for our common defence, and that what we give is applied to those uses for which we give, and the army paid. This offer, Sir, as I re|member, began when an observation was made by you of the long accounts, and that a great part of the king's revenue remained in the hands of the receivers; to which a worthy member answered, It could not be helped, by reason some receivers were members of parliament, and stood upon their privileges. To which another member answered, That we could not deprive members of their privi|leges; but that to remedy the like for the future, we were ready to pass a vote, that no member of par|liament should be a receiver of the king's revenue. This alarmed the whole body of men in office; so that some stood up, and to prevent the house from harping any longer upon that string, said, They so little valued their own profit, that they were willing to resign all their fees, salaries, and perquisites ex|ceeding
<PB N="210" REF="013851_0741_0F9E28C5983A6480">
300 <HI>l. per annum,</HI> towards the next yearly charge. This, if really intended, was very generous; but if it were only a compliment, a shift, or expedi|ent to avoid the present vote we were upon, that no member of parliament should be a receiver of the revenue, nothing was more disingenuous; nor could a greater abuse be offered to the house; for we pro|ceeded so far as to vote, that judges, and some others, should not be comprehended. People abroad, who received our votes, will think strangely of it, if after all these preparations we do nothing in it, and suffer ourselves to be thus gulled. But I hope better of the worthy gentlemen, and cannot but think they were in earnest with this house upon so solemn a debate <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. III.195.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Trenchard</HI> proposes, in order to check corrup|tion, that parliament establish a commission for enquir|ing, by oath, into all abuses of the civil list and other revenues; into useless offices, salaries, perquisites, bills of offices, pensions, &amp;c. excepting only the king's privy-purse; report to be made to parliament.

<P><Q>In the late reigns, and particularly in the long pensionary parliament in the reign of <HI>Ch.</HI> II. the nation became very sensible of the mischievous con|sequences which had already happened, and the more fatal which might still result, from the dan|gerous
<PB N="211" REF="013851_0742_0F9E28C655FB4608">
breach which had been made in our ancient constitution. It was now evident to the meanest capa|city, that a designing prince, who, with the assist|ance of a wicked ministry, should be able, after several trials, at last to procure a parliament to his purpose, would have the liberties of the people en|tirely in his power, and might govern them at pleasure; from which state of slavery it was evident, that nothing less than a revolution could rescue them; and if they failed in that experiment, that then their chains would be riveted for ever. Under this melancholy prospect of affairs the nation groaned, and complaints were heard in every corner of our streets; and even the very pensioners in that par|liament were not arrived to such a pitch of impiety as to take pleasure in the drudgery they had en|gaged in, but acted with reluctancy and remorse, and, as we have been very lately told in this place, betrayed the cause they had so wickedly espoused, and frequently gave notice to the friends of <HI>England</HI> of the attempts which were to be made on the liberties of their country. This pensionary parliament was at last dissolved, but with what view, and by what advice, I will not pretend to say. Certain it is, that that prince never had it afterwards in his power, in a parliamentary way, to destroy the liberties of the people. The resumption of charters was then put in practice, with many other expedients towards the establishment of an absolute monarchy, which had been long in view; but by the death of that prince, and the unskilful conduct of his next suc|cessor, an end was put to these designs for that time, the people having unanimously applied the only remedy in such cases; and this brought about the late happy revolution.</Q></P>

<P><Q>Sir, As this <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM.

I was indeed surprized to hear the worthy gentleman, who spoke last, say, that he thought it the most ex|traordinary and unreasonable bill that he had ever seen brought into this house; for if the gentleman will look into our Journals, he will see that this very bill has been often brought in, and has almost al|ways been passed in this house;
[in confidence of its being thrown out by the lords, which looks more decent] and I am sure, if ever it was thought reasonable by this house, it must now be thought much more so, when the number of placemen is much greater in this house than it was heretofore. The worthy gentleman has likewise told us, that he thinks the bill unjust, both with respect to the crown, the people, and the gentlemen who have the honour to be employed by the crown. As to which I shall take notice, in general, that by the same method of reasoning he may pretend to shew us,
<PB N="213" REF="013851_0744_0F9E28C7D193E890">
that all the laws that were ever made for regulating elections were unjust, and were encroachments upon the rights of the people. I shall readily agree with him, that the people are the properest judges who ought to be chosen by them for representatives in parliament; and I am confident, that were they left to a free choice, we should not see so many civil and military officers brought into parliament. The people, I believe, would always think themselves more secure in being represented by country-gentle|men, with whom they are well acquainted, and who can have no interest separate from them, than by clerks of offices, or such other persons, whom they perhaps never saw, or heard of, before they came down to be chosen their representatives, and whom probably they may never see again, till they return to ask the same favour; which every gentle|man here knows to be often the case of many of our little boroughs in <HI>England.</HI> But to say that it would be any injustice to lay a restraint upon the people as to the choice of their representatives, seems to me very extraordinary, when we consider the laws now in being, by which the people are restrained from chusing any gentleman for their representative who is not possessed of such an estate. Surely we may, with respect to elections, without being guilty of any injustice, lay what restrainsts we think necessary for the good of the public, and the preservation of our constitution; for I am sure that whatever is for the benefit of the people cannot be justly said or thought to be injurious to the crown. It is extra|ordinary to say, that what is proposed by this bill would be an injustice done to those who are thereby to be made incapable of being elected; for have not
<PB N="214" REF="013851_0745_0F9E28CAFA178D30">
we already a law, by which all the officers con|cerned in the collection of the customs and excise, are rendered incapable of being chosen members of parliament, and yet I have never before heard it urged that there was any injustice done to those gentlemen by excluding them from having seats in parliament as long as they are in an office, which is inconsistent with their being members of this house. I will allow, that the choice made by the burgesses of a little borough, or by the freeholders of a county, if it falls upon an officer, civil or military, shews that the majority of those electors, at that time, did not think the office he then enjoyed incompatible or inconsistent with his being their representative; but I hope it will not be said that the burgesses of a little borough, or even the freeholders of a county, are better judges in this respect than the representa|tives of the whole people of <HI>Great Britain</HI> met in this house, especially when the opinion of this house is approved off and confirmed by the other two branches of our legislature. As to the alternative pretended, that if this bill should pass into a law, it would render either the officers civil and military contemptible, of this house contemptible, in the eyes of the people; I cannot imagine how it could produce either of these effects; for a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the officers, civil or military, is it to be imagined, that a suc|cessful general or admiral, a brave and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xperienced captain by sea or land, or a civil officer, honest, expert, and diligent in the station he is in, would be contemned because he was not capable of being a member of this house? Were the clergy ever brought into contempt by their being excluded the privilege of being chosen members of parliament? On the contrary, I believe they never got any ho|nour
<PB N="215" REF="013851_0746_0F9E28CC2DEB0910">
by being members of either house; and I believe there are very few officers, civil or military, in the kingdom, who ever gained much honour or much repute among the people by their being mem|bers of either house of parliament, unless when their being such was the occasion of their being turned out of the offices they enjoyed, and might have continued to enjoy to their own honour, and the advantage of their country, if they had not been members of parliament. As to the other part of the alternative, that this house may be rendered contemptible by what is now proposed, I am not in the least afraid of it; but I am very much afraid, that if some bill of this nature is not speedily passed into a law, this house will become contemptible in the eyes, not only of our own people, but of the whole world. Gentlemen may pretend that no man is influenced in his way of thinking, or in his man|ner of acting, in this house, by the post or the office he possesses, and from which he may be turned out, whenever a prime minister may have a mind; but while men are men, I am convinced there will always be a great number, by far, I fear, the greatest number, who will rather vote accord|ing to the directions of the prime minister for the time being, than run the risk of being turned out of the lucrative post or office they then hold at the pleasure of the crown; and if ever a majority of this house should happen to be composed of such men, I am sure it will become as contemptible as ever the senate of <HI>Rome</HI> was, after it became the political tool of their arbitrary and tyrannical em|perors. I will likewise agree with the honourable gentlemen, that it may be necessary, at least it may be convenient, for this house always to have in it <HI>some</HI> of those gentlemen, who belong too, and are
<PB N="216" REF="013851_0747_0F9E28CC5D777118">
conversant in, the methods of transacting business in the several great offices of the kingdom; and therefore I am not for excluding from seats in par|liament <HI>all</HI> those who are in offices, civil and mili|tary. I believe no gentleman in this house ever had any such thought in his head; and if gentlemen will but peruse the bill, as it stands now, they will see that there is to be an exception, which is now left blank, as in all such cases is usual, in order that when we go into a committee, gentlemen may then propose the filling up in that blank as many officers, or as many sorts of officers, as they have a mind. About this, indeed, I expected there might have been some debates; but considering the great num|ber of officers of all sorts we have now in the house, considering how greatly the number may be encreased in times to come; considering the great clamour al|ready raised in the nation against so many officers being in this house; I really did not expect that any gentleman would have opposed the committing of the bill, or would have pretended that the passing of some such bill was not become necessary, both for the honour of this house and the safety of our consti|tution. To conclude, the bill is at present but a blank; but I am confident it may be made a good and reasonable bill, and agreeable to every gentle|man in this house; therefore, I hope, the house will agree to the going into a committee upon it, because, if gentlemen do not like it after the blanks are filled up, they may then drop it, or throw it out upon the third reading <NOTE PLACE="foot">DEB. COM VIII.122.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In the famous year 1739, a place-bill, as above mentioned, was proposed to the commons by Mr. <HI>Sandys</HI> in the following speech:</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="013851_0748_0F9E28CD1281F5F8">
<Q>Sir, I am now going to lay before you a proposal which has already been several times made to you, without meeting with that success which I thought it deserved; but as I think it a good one, and abso|lutely necessary for the preservation of our consti|tution, I am far from being discouraged by its former bad success, nor shall I be discouraged from a future attempt, even though it should now meet with as bad a reception as heretofore, because I am fully con|vinced of the truth of that observation, which was long ago made by one of our best lawyers: That a good bill or motion once proposed in parliament, and entered upon our journals, can never die: It may at first meet with bad success: it may meet with repeated bad success; but, unless our constitu|tion be absolutely and irrecoverably destroyed, it will by its own merits, at last force its way through the several branches of our legislature.</Q>
[This crite|rion, if applied to the present times, when we have reason to think no merits whatever would carry a bill through the houses, unless it were favoured by the ministry, is so shocking, that it will hardly bear to be thought of.]
<Q>The proposal, I am to make, Sir, is plainly and in short, this, That criminals may not be allowed to be their own judges; and that our liberties may not be committed to the keep|ing of those who are retained to destroy them. It is the duty of parliament to redress all public grie|vances, and punish all high and heinous offenders, who have been artful or powerful enough to evade the laws of the kingdom. It is the duty of parlia|ment to grant no more money for the public service than what is absolutely necessary, and to see that money properly applied and duly accounted for. And it is the duty of parliament to watch over the
<PB N="218" REF="013851_0749_0F9E28CDD40C2808">
liberties and privileges of the people, by taking care not to pass any laws that are inconsistent with the liberties and privileges of the people, and by pro|viding speedy and effectual remedies against all en|croachments that have been, or may be, made by ambitious princes, or guilty ministers. These, Sir, are among the chief of the duties of parliament; but how can we expect a performance, if a majority of the members be such, whose self-preservation or security depends upon their neglecting or acting con|trary to these duties? Can we expect, that public grievances will be redressed, if a majority of par|liament be such as have themselves been, or such as are the friends and confederates of those that have been the cause of these public grievances? Can we expect that any high offender will be punished by parliament, if the majority of it be such as have been companions and sharers with him in his crimes, or such whose chief subsistence depends upon screen|ing him from justice? Can we expect that any sup|ply demanded by the crown will be refused, if it is to be granted by those, whose chief subsistence de|pends upon making the grant; or that the public money will be properly applied, or duly accounted for, if those who have applied or may apply it to their own use, are to be the only inspectors of the public accounts? Or, lastly, Sir, can we expect that a parliament will guard against the encroach|ments of an ambitious prince or guilty minister, if the majority of that parliament be such as have the whole, or a necessary part of their subsistence, from the places or pensions they hold at the arbitrary will of that ambitious prince, or guilty minister? These are questions, which, in my opinion, can be answered in the affirmative by no man who will
<PB N="219" REF="013851_0750_0F9E28CF10F14BA8">
and dare make use of his reason; and yet every one of these questions must, I think, be answered in the affirmative by those who affirm that our constitution can never be in any danger from a majority or near a majority of this house being composed of such as hold places and pensions at the arbitrary will of the crown. I shall grant, Sir, that it may be necessary for us to have amongst us some of the chief officers of the treasury, admi|ralty, and army, as well as several others of those that are employed by his majesty as chief officers in the executive part of our government. These, I say, it may be necessary to have amongst us, in order to give us such information, as may often become necessary in the several branches of business that come regularly before this house.</Q>
[Here Mr. <HI>Sandys</HI> might have observed, that even supposing the <HI>presence</HI> of some of the officers of state necessary occasionally in the house of commons, it does not follow, that their <HI>voting</HI> is necessary. The judges sit in the upper house, as skilled in the laws; but they do not <HI>vote.</HI>]
<Q>But I am sure it is no way necessary, but on the contrary, quite inconsistent with the dig|nity of this house, to have it filled with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">erks of of offices, and inferior officers of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avy and army. I confess I have the greatest regard fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> such of those as we at have at present amonst us; because I hope they have all so much honour, that they would disdain to sacrifice their duty, as members of this house, to any selfish consideration; but we cannot be sure that those who succeed them in their offices and employments will be gentlemen of so much honour; and as they may likewise succeed them with regard to their seats in this house, our constitution may be thereby brought into the utmost danger; for if I were not
<PB N="220" REF="013851_0751_0F9E28CF84311EC0">
well assured of the honour of those officers we have now amongst us, we have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ready such a number, that I should think our constitution upon the brink of destruction; and as the number may increase so as, in a short time, to become the majority of this house, whilst we have it in our power, we ought to take care to provide against this danger by limit|ing the number of officers that are to have seats in this house; for if the majority of this house should once come to be composed of officers, and these officers such as had a greater regard to the places they possess, or preferments they hope for, than to the liberties and constitution of their country, it would be ridiculous to think of getting the approba|tion of this house to any such regulation. There|fore, Sir, as this is not yet, I hope, our unfortunate case, I shall beg leave to move, that leave may be given to bring in a bill for the better securing the freedom of parliament, by limiting the number of officers to sit in the house of commons <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. XI.202.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. (late lord) <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> spoke in defence of it as follows.</P>
<P><Q>Sir, while this house is full of independent gen|tlemen, or of such placemen only whose places are not so much the best of their property, that they cannot risk the loss of them without a spirit of mar|tyrdom, who have something of their own sufficient to outweigh their employments, and while the num|ber even of these shall be confined within some mode|rate bounds, a minister must regard this assembly as an awful tribunal, before which he is constantly to account for his conduct: He must respect your judg|ments, he must dread your censures, he must feel
<PB N="221" REF="013851_0752_0F9E28D121F851D0">
your superintendency. But we can imagine a future house of commons so crowded with placemen, that a specta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r in the gallery might be apt to mistake and think himself at the levee of a minister instead of a parliament. The benches here may be covered not only with officers of rank in the government, not only with the servants of the crown, but with the servants, perhaps, of their servants; and what senti|ments, Sir, have we reason to think the sight of a house so filled would excite in a minister? Would he think himself in the presence of his country, or in the midst of a guard that would enable him to defy its justice, and de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">de its resentment. The possibility of this happening hereafter is the ground of this bill, which therefore the people of <HI>England</HI> do not only consider as a single point to be gained for them upon any present necessity, but as a general security against all they apprehend for the future. Sir, my worthy friend, who made you this motion, in the opening of it explained to you sufficiently, that there is no intent of running into any extremes. If I thought there was, I would oppose it as much as any man here. I know but one thing more preposterous than such a general place-bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l as would exclude all persons in office from a seat in this house, and that is to leave the number of them under no limitation at all. But for fear of starving, must we die of a surfeit? Be|tween these two absurdities, can no medium be found? Cannot we continue those amongst us who are of any use to the house, who can give any assistance, any weight, any facility, any grace to our proceedings, and shut the door against others, whom it is neither decent, nor safe, to admit? Sir, the doing this is easy; it will be done by this bill, it is what the wisdom of former parliaments would have
<PB N="222" REF="013851_0753_0F9E28D192CC7830">
done long before now. But the reason they did it not was, It never entered into their thoughts to conceive that some, who have since sat in parliament, would attempt to come there, I do not mean, from any personal incapacity, but from the nature itself of their offices, incompatible almost with the very idea of a member of parliament. It is a surprizing thing; but it is verified by what we see every day, that the common practice of some ages goes beyond even the fears of the past. We must, therefore, supply from experience what our predecessors failed to foresee; and we are called upon to do so by the unanimous voice of the nation. Sir, the greatest affairs before us are of less importance than this. It is better <HI>Spain</HI> should invade the freedom of the <HI>American</HI> seas, than the crown of <HI>England</HI> violate the independence of parliament. It is not <HI>Spanish</HI> or <HI>French</HI> arms, but <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>French</HI> maxims of go|vernment, that we should have most to fear from, if the vigilant caution, the jealous spirit of liberty in this house did not concur with the goodness, the natural goodness of his majesty, to secure our free constituti|on. Let the cortes of <HI>Spain,</HI> let the parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> be a warning to us; let them shew us what we may come to, if we do not prevent the growth of corruption, before it produces here the insensible, gradual, fatal change it did there.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sir, I am trying to recollect what objections have been made to this bill, and I protest I can find none that seem to me to want a reply. One chiefly in|sisted upon is, That it carries an air of suspicion. Sir, in all the states that I have read of antient and modern, the most suspicious people have been always the latest enslaved. To suspect human frailty in tempting circumstances, is a very natural jealousy;
<PB N="223" REF="013851_0754_0F9E28D3469CFE40">
and a too secure confidence will hardly be thought a parliamentary virtue. It is painful indeed to be sus|pected, but the greater the pain, the greater the desire should be to remove that suspicion. But, Sir, against the present house of commons, no such sus|picion can be conceived&mdash;Upon what grounds should it be founded? Upon what probability? Has the private discourse of such gentlemen here ever been different from their public behaviour? Have they ever talked one way and voted another? Have there been any indications of a private interest, that of any one man ever prevailing over that of the nation, against fact, reason, or justice? Have not the ma|jority here constantly shewn the strongest conviction, that their conduct was strictly conformable to the most disinterested love of their country? Such a house of commons ought not to be, is not suspected: But granting such a doubt to have been formed, Is this the way to remove it? Will the rejecting this bill clear our character, or can all the art and power of calumny give half the weight to an imputation of that kind as such a proceeding? Sir, to those who treat this bill as chimerical thing, an idle specu|lative project, I will say but one word, That the most chemerical thing in nature is the notion of a free constitution, where the restraining powers are not entirely exempt from dependency. Such liberty is indeed a speculation fit for school-boys; for what would terms and appearances avail, if independence were lost? You might retain the vain ensigns of your former authority, but would they give you any dignity? Would they be of any use to the public? The mace there upon your table, what would it signify? It might be born before you with ridiculous pomp; but it would be what <HI>Cromwel</HI> called it once,
<PB N="224" REF="013851_0755_0F9E28D4671D3AB8">
a mere bauble; or, if it had any weight, it would be only to oppress, not to protect. Sir, the present form of our government, k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ep it but free from cor|ruption, is so wisely constitu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, the powers in it are so happily mixed, that it has all the advantages of a republic without the defects and evils attending o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. But, on the other side, I must say that if it should be corrupted, if the contracts of parliament should be bought off by the crown, the very reverse w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uld be true; and it would h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve all the defects, all the evils of an absolute monarchy, without the ad|vantages; it would be a more expensive, and worse administred abs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lute power. Sir, I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe it is under|stood that in what I have said I am only contending for a provisional security against a mischief not yet felt in all its malignity, but yet of so increasing a nature, and such ruinous consequences, that we must be b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind not to foresee, and worse than carele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, not to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vent them.

COM. XI.208.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pulteney,</HI> on the same occasion, spoke as fol|lows.</P>
<P><Q>Sir, The opposition made to this motion, is, in my opinion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one of the strongest arguments that can be made us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of in its favour, and must I think appear so to every man, who considers the persons conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed in that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">position, and the arguments they make use of for s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pporting it. Who are the persons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat
<PB N="225" REF="013851_0756_0F9E28D493C9B068">
oppose this motion? Who were they that have al|ways opposed such motions? Placemen, ministers, and the favourites or pensioners of ministers. What do they say for justifying their opposition? They deny a principle, a maxim, which in all ages, in all countries has hitherto been acknowledged; and upon which many of our laws now in being, are founded. That a gentleman's behaviour in this house may be influenced by a place or pension, is a maxim univer|sally acknowledged, and in this kingdom so much established, that we have already by law excluded many of the former, and all the latter, from having seats in this house. We have, I say, already by law excluded all pensioners from having seats in this house, and I should be glad to know the difference between a pension of 1000<HI>l.</HI> a year, and a place with a sallary of 1000<HI>l.</HI> a year. I know of none, save only that the latter is generally more valuable than the former; and therefore a gentleman will be more loth to lose it, or to give a vote in this house, that may disoblige a minister, who can take it from him. I say, Sir, that a place with a salary of 1000<HI>l.</HI> a year, is more valuable, than a pension of 1000<HI>l.</HI> a year; because a place furnishes a gentleman with an opportunity to serve his friends, and perhaps to provide some of them with little places, or offices under him. To which I must add, that a place often furnishes a gentleman who is not very scrupu|lous, with an opportunity of plundering his country yearly, of twice, perhaps ten times, the value of his salary; and this, I must observe, makes another very material difference, between a place and a pension. A placeman may very probably be a person, whose conduct this house ought to enquire into. He may be a public criminal, and therefore he will certainly
<PB N="226" REF="013851_0757_0F9E28D55B844FC0">
be against an impartial and strict enquiry into the conduct of any minister, officer, or placeman, lest the enquiry should at last light upon himself. There is therefore greater reason for excluding all place|men, than for excluding all pensioners from having seats in this house. Our admitting some of the for|mer, does not proceed from an opinion, that a gen|tleman's behaviour may not be influenced by a place, as much as by a pension, but from the necessity we are under of having some great officers amongst us, in order to give us proper information and direction in many affairs that must come under our considera|tion. For this reason, when I hear gentlemen who have very good places, gravely telling us, that no gentleman of family or fortune can by any place he may enjoy, or expect, be induced to join in measures that may be of dangerous consequence to the consti|tution or liberties of his country, I think it is a clear proof not only that the behaviour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a gentleman of family and fortune may be influenced by the posts he enjoys or expects, but also that his judgment may be byassed. He may thereby be induced to think those things indifferent, or of no moment, that are far from being so. He may be thereby induced to think the liberties of his country in no danger, when they are upon the very brink of destruction. Sir, let us consider that of the 513 members who represent <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> there are but 92 chosen by counties, and of the remaing 421, there are at least 350 chosen by cities, boroughs, and cinque ports, where the administration would have the absolute command and direction. If this should ever happen to be our unlucky situation, can we suppose that any gentleman would set up to be a member of this house, or a representative even for any of our coun|ties,
<PB N="227" REF="013851_0758_0F9E28D61C6B3520">
but such as resolved to submit with regard to their behaviour here to the absolute direction of the prime minister? No gentleman of honour would put himself to expence, or expose himself to the resent|ment of an all powerful minister, if by setting up us a candidate at any election, he were absolutely certain that he could thereby do his country no service. Instead of gentlemen of family, fortune, character, or interest in their country, we should then see this house filled with the lowest tools and vilest sycophants of absolute power. Instead of this house's being a check upon ministers, it would then, like the parliament of <HI>France,</HI> or the <HI>Roman</HI> senates un|der their emperors, be an instrument for the oppressions of ministers, and a cloak for their crimes. The most rapacious plunderer, the most tyrannical oppressor would then insolently boast, that he did nothing but according to law, that the public treasure was regularly accounted for in parliament, and that he was at all times ready to submit his conduct to a parliamentary enquiry. Surely, Sir, no gentleman can think that the liberties of this nation consist in our having the resemblance of a parliament. We may have a parliament, that parliament may be chosen once every seven years, may sit annually as it does now, may pass laws, grant money, receive accounts, and even make enquiries, and yet we may have neither constitution, nor liberty left; for if it should once come to be in the power of the administration to have always a majority in parlia|ment, ready to obey the directions given them by the ministers, there would be no necessity for destroying the form of our constitution, or for making a direct and absolute surrender of our liberties. Without either of these, our sovereign would be as absolute,
<PB N="228" REF="013851_0759_0F9E28D6E4955B40">
and might be more tyrannical, than the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> himself. Such a parliament would grant him as many saphis and janiza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es as he thought necessary, for keeping his slaves in subjection; would give him any revenue he pleased to demand, and would pass whatever laws he might please to propose; and the judges being under no parliamentary restraint, would in every part of his dominions give judgment accord|ing to the directions of the prime vizier, or govern|ing bashaw. Thus oppression would be countenanced by the forms of law, the people plundered, and the innocent murdered, by the administration of justice. It is this sort of ruin, Sir, we have chiefly to ap|prehend, and this sort of ruin we may step by step be led into, without our being sensible of the several steps. We shall certainly be led into it, if we trust any longer the guardianship of our liberties to those whose foresight is dimmed by the places they enjoy, or expect. If a minister were to propose a law for giving the crown a power of sending to every county, city, and borough in the kingdom, such a <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng&egrave; d'elire</HI> for the choice of members of parliament, as is now sent to a dean and chapter for the choice of a bishop, I believe very few gentlemen of family or fortune, would, for the sake of any place, ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee to it. But an equivalent power may be got by multiplying penal laws, and increasing the number and power of officers; and a gentleman of fortune, family, character, and interest in his country may, by a good place, be induced to believe, that such a law, or such an increase of the number and power of officers, is necessary for preventing fraudulent practices, or the like; and may therefore agree to it, without seeing the danger our constitution may be thereby exposed to. Thus, by degrees, he may be made to agree to such propo|sitions,

one after another, till he has thereby esta|blished in the crown the absolute direction of most of the elections in the kingdom. This, Sir, would have been the certain consequence of the late excise scheme; and yet there were many gentlemen of family and fortune that approved of it. I am con|vinced they did not foresee this consequence; nay, I have so much charity as to believe, that the chief patron of that scheme did not; but every impartial man in the kingdom is now, I believe, sensible of it. That scheme was indeed, such a large step towards giving the crown the direction of most of our elections, and by good luck was so thoroughly considered before it was brought into this house, that most gentlemen became sensible of the danger before it was too late; and that was the cause of its meeting with the fate it deserved; but its fate will be a warning to future ministers not to attempt making such a large step at once: they will from thence see that they must grasp at this power by little and little, which they will certainly do, and as certainly at last accomplish, unless we take care to exclude from this house most of those who, by the places they enjoy, are induced to have a better opinion of ministers than any man ought to have, that is entrusted with the guardianship of the constitution and liberties of his country. The question is not, Sir, whether a gentleman may be induced by the office or place he holds or ex|pects, to make at once, and in an open and direct manner, an absolute surrender of the liberties of his country. No prince, or minister, of common sense will ever desire such a surrender, because, if he can get into his hands an uncontroulable power over most of our elections, and consequently the
<PB N="230" REF="013851_0761_0F9E28DB0E8BC140">
direction of the parliaments chosen by this uncon|troulable power, his power will in every respect be as absolute, and may be exercised in a more arbi|trary manner, and with greater security to himself, than it could be without the appearance of a par|liamentary authority; for every unpopular and op|pressive measure would then be made the act and deed of the parliament; and the lenity of the minister in the execution of those penal laws enacted by parliament, or in the exercise of those powers granted him by parliament, would be set forth and extolled by his tools in a Gazetteer, or some such paper, published by his authority, and dispersed through the whole kingdom at the public expence. The question, therefore, now before us, is, Whether a gentleman's eyes may not, by a lucrative and honourable post of employment, be so overclouded as to prevent his seeing through the plausible pre|tences that may, from time to time, be made use of by an artful minister, for getting into his hands, or into the hands of the crown, such an uncon|troulable power as I have mentioned; and this question, even with respect to Gentlemen of family and fortune, will, I am sure, be answered in the affirmative by every man in this kingdom, who does not possess or expect some post or employment, or some of those titles of honour which, by our constitution, as it is now modelled, the crown has absolutely at its disposal. To tell us, Sir, that our liberties can never be in danger from a majority of placemen in this house, unless the people be gene|rally abandoned as to all principles of virtue and public good, and unless the crown has, at the same time, formed designs against our liberties; and that the only method for removing this danger, in case
<PB N="231" REF="013851_0762_0F9E28DB5C9A7E98">
we should at any time be threatened with it, would be to take proper measures for restoring virtue and public spirit among the people, and for removing evil counsellors from about the throne&mdash;to tell us this, I say, Sir, in a serious manner, is something very extraordinary: It is mistaking the effect for the cause, and desiring us to begin at the wrong end. Corruption, Sir, is not the effect, but the cause of a general depravity of manners among the people of any country, and has in all countries, as well as this, been first practised and encouraged by ministers and courtiers. It would therefore be ridi|culous in us to think of restoring virtue among the people, till we have once made it impossible for ministers and courtiers to corrupt them; and I am sure it would be still more ridiculous in us to think of removing an evil counsellor from about the throne, till we have once removed his creatures and tools out of this house. I hope, Sir, there are at present no evil counsellors about the throne; if there were, I am sure no such counsellor has a majority of his creatures and tools in this house. If this were the case, it would have been very ridiculous to have made such a motion as this now before us. It would be very ridiculous to think of restoring our constitution by any legal method. It is this mis|fortune we intend to prevent by the bill now moved for. It is a misfortune now foreseen by all unpre|judiced men in the kingdom. I hope it is not yet too late to think of preventing it by a legal method; for after we have once fallen into this misfortune, it will be impossible to recover. If an ambitious minister should once get a majority of his creatures and tools into this house, can we suppose they would consent to impeach or remove him from the
<PB N="232" REF="013851_0763_0F9E28DC188E5C98">
throne Can we suppose they would ever consent to any bill that might tend to distress the administra|tion of their master? Can we suppose they would refuse any thing that might tend to prolong his ad|ministration and increase his power? Every attempt to restore the constitution would be branded with the name of republicanism. The discontents of the people would be called disaffection and jacobitism; every opposition would be said to proceed from malice and resentment; and the misfortune would be, that many honest well-meaning men, induced by their places to have a better opinion of ministers than they ought to have, would give credit to these pretences, and would believe that by agreeing to the minister's arbitrary schemes, they were only strengthening the hands of the government against republicanism, jacobitism, and sedition. If it were possible to be merry in a debate of so great import|ance, it would be diverting to observe the contra|diction in the arguments made use of against this motion. By some our gentlemen of family and for|tune are represented to be men of such strict honour and such clean heads, that no place or pension can mislead their judgment, or misdirect their will; no selfish consideration can make them overlook the danger our liberties may be exposed to, or consent to any thing they think may in the least endanger our constitution. By others, again, our gentlemen of family and fortune are represented as such selfish mercenary creatures, that unless the government would give them posts or pensions, they would refuse to consent to those things that are absolutely necessary for the ends of government and the pre|servation of their country. Now these two contra|dictory positions, though they cannot be equally
<PB N="233" REF="013851_0764_0F9E28DCD43245D8">
true, may be, and I believe they are, equally false. We have, I believe, some gentlemen amongst us whose judgment cannot be biassed, nor their will directed by any selfish consideration. Such men, I hope, we shall always have in some of our highest offices, and these are not designed by this bill to be excluded from having seats in this house; but their number will always be small, and therefore not sufficient by themselves alone to support the constitution against a combination of all the fools and knaves that may hereafter get into this house; therefore we must en|deavour to prevent this combination, and this can only be done by such a bill as is now proposed. On the other hand, I believe, here may be some amongst us, who propose nothing by their service in this house, but their own private advantage; and whilst we have placemen and pensioners amongst us, such men will endeavour all they can to get into parliament: Nay, it may become so customary for every man that votes with the court to have a place or a pension, that no man will do so without some such reward. But if ever this selfish spirit should get into parliament, our constitution will be undone; and to prevent this is the design of the bill now moved for: If no man could, by being a mem|ber of parliament, propose to get any place, or office, or any advantage to himself, the mercenary and selfish would seldom endeavour to get themselves chosen, at least they would never be at any expence for this purpose; and as such men have seldom a great natural interest in any part of the kingdom, there would always be such a small number of them in parliament, that their opposition could never ob|struct or retard any thing that seemed necessary for the just ends of government, or for the preservation
<PB N="234" REF="013851_0765_0F9E28DD97402600">
and happiness of the society. The public good would then be the only aim of ministers, as well as members, because neither of them could hope for success in any other; and as men of good sense and strict honour are the best judges, and the most ready to agree upon what is necessary for the public good, it would then be as much the business of ministers to get such men chosen, as it is now their business to get such members chosen as are men of mercenary tempers or shallow understandings; for all ministers will have jobs to do in parliament as long as they have any hopes of success, and the weak or mer|cenary will always be the most proper for this pur|pose. I am indeed surprised, Sir, to hear it said by an honourable gentleman, whose attachment to the present establishment is not to be doubted, that if most placemen were excluded from this house, there would soon be a majority of Jacobites in it. Such a supposition is not to be made, without first sup|posing that a great majority of the people are Jaco|bites; and to suppose this is, I am sure, no com|pliment to our present royal family, and much less to the king now upon our throne. As long as our parliaments are independent, and our elections free, there can never be any considerable number of Jaco|bites either in this house or in the nation; but if there should once come to be a majority of place|men and officers in the house, that majority would soon create a majority of Jacobites in the nation; and in that case, though the majority within doors might be a good security to ministers against parlia|mentary prosecutions, yet it would be but a bad security for the royal family against an insurrection of the whole people without doors. The army,
<PB N="235" REF="013851_0766_0F9E28DE9AE47DB0">
upon which we now seem so much to depend, or a great part of them, would probably join with the people, and the certain consequence would be the overthrow of our present establishment. This dan|ger, I know, a guilty minister will always choose to expose his master to, rather than expose himself to a legal trial before a free and independent parli|ament; because, in a general conflagration, he may possibly escape notice, or may perhaps be able to sacri|fice his master by way of an atonement for himself; but those who support him in thus exposing his mas|ter, can have no great regard for their sovereign, and in such an event would certainly meet with the contempt and punishment they so highly deserved. For this reason, Sir, as I have a greater regard for the security of the royal family than I have for that of our present ministers, or of any set of ministers, that shall ever get into the management of our public affairs, I shall be for putting it out of the power of any future minister to over-turn our con|stitution, by getting a majority of placemen and pensioners into this house. This, I think, is now become absolutely necessary for preventing our being brought under one of the worst sort of tyrannical governments that was ever contrived, or established. For this purpose the bill now moved for is one of the most certain, and one of the most obvious me|thods that can be thought of. It can be attended with no inconvenience. It is impossible to shew so much as a plausible reason against it; and there|fore, if this motion be rejected, it must afford a most melancholy reflection to every one that understands our constitution, and has a regard for the liberties of his country.</Q></P>

<Q>As nothing can effectually secure the freedom of our happy constitution, except an uncorrupt, and independent representation of the people, we insist on your utmost endeavours to procure a proper bill for reducing and limiting the number of placemen in the house of commons, especially as so many gentle|men, in a situation of manifest dependence, were known to have seats in the last parliament <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P>A motion was made, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1742, by Mr. <HI>Corn|wall,</HI> that leave be given to bring in a bill for the better securing the freedom of parliaments, by limit|ing the number of officers in the house of commons. Sir <HI>Watkin Williams Wynne</HI> seconded the motion to the following effect:</P>
<P><Q>Sir, As this motion was last session agreed to, and as the bill itself was brought in, and in every step approved of by this very house of commons, I should with great confidence of success rise up to second this motion, if I did not, from experience, know, that gentlemen often change their sentiments with their situation; and that a gentleman, after he be|comes a placeman, begins to entertain notions of the prerogatives of the crown, and the liberties of the people, very different from those he held whilst he was a plain honest country gentleman. If any thing like this should happen in the present debate, it may tend to disappoint the motion; but with all those who are neither placemen nor pensioners, I am sure it ought to be an argument in its favour; and I hope it will prevail with some gentlemen, who, in former sessions, opposed this motion, to alter their sentiments and their way of voting upon this occasion, when they have such a plain proof
<PB N="238" REF="013851_0769_0F9E28E399B61F70">
before their eyes, that if a place does not induce a man to vote against his honour and his conscience, it at least biasses his judgment, and makes him con|clude that to be wrong which he before thought, and declared to be right. Another strong argu|ment in favour of this motion, Sir, is, the melan|choly and distressed condition which the affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> as well as of this nation, are now reduced to. We have, for near thirty years, been in a course of approving and supporting almost every political measure the crown seemed resolved to pur|sue. With regard to foreign affairs, we have ap|proved and supported every one of them without exception. Thank God, I have had no concern in this general uninterrupted approbation. I have, at the respective times, publicly declared my dislike of many of them, and yet I am far from thinking that any of those who approved voted at any time against the plain dictates of their conscience; but I am convinced that many of them were biassed in their judgments by the fears of losing the places they pos|sessed, or the hopes of getting the titles, places, or preferments, they expected. In disputes on parti|cular subjects in politics, it is very easy to impose upon gentlemen who have never made that science their study, and are never let into any secrets of state, unless with a design to deceive them; therefore, in all such cases, I have great charity for those who hap|pen to differ from me in opinion. But when the wickedness or folly of the measures begins to appear from the fatal consequences they have pro|duced, my charity begins to cease with respect to those who persevere in their opinions, and refuse coming into any method for preventing themselves or their successors in this house from being deceived
<PB N="239" REF="013851_0770_0F9E28E4551B55E8">
by the same biass towards a court. I have, Sir, as great an opinion, as any gentleman ought to have of the honour and impartiality of those who are members of either house of parliament; but it is arguing against common sense, and common ex|perience to pretend that no member of this house will be biassed in his opinion, or influenced in his voting by 500 or 1000, or perhaps, 5000<HI>l.</HI> a year. It has in all countries, and in all ages, been held as an established maxim, that no man ought to be allowed to sit as a judge, or even as a jury-man, in any cause where he is to get or lose by the event of the suit; and as we sit as judges almost in every case that can come before us between the people and their sovereign, or those employed by him in the executive part of our government, surely no man ought to be allowed to sit here, who is to get or lose the whole, or the chief part of his subsistence by the judgment he passes upon any affair de|pending in this house. In former times, Sir, when we had no standing army, nor any officers of our army kept in continual pay; when we had no excise, nor excisemen; when we had few or no taxes, and as few tax-gatherers, it was not neces|sary to have any such law enacted; because no public officer then ever thought of getting himself chosen a member of parliament; whilst he remained in pay, he was obliged to attend the duty of his office, and consequently could neither attend the business, nor be chosen a member of parliament. This is the true reason why the high-sheriff of a county cannot even now be chosen a member of this house; and when this maxim was first established by common law, or, as the lawyers call it, common reason only, it fell by degrees into disuse, and public officers of
<PB N="240" REF="013851_0771_0F9E28E512EE6F80">
all ranks and degrees may be, and are, now chosen members of parliament except high sheriffs, and some few others, who have been disqualified by express statute. Thus, Sir, our constitution stands at present; and as the number of our public officers of all kinds, and in all stations, has been of late years vastly increased, and is every day increasing; as their yearly profits and emoluments have been vastly augmented; and as their power is growing every year more and more extensive, they have now a great sway in all our elections, especially those for our cities and boroughs; so that in a few years, we may, nay, we <HI>must</HI> expect, that a majority of this house will always consist of such as hold or expect offices, places, or private pensions at the pleasure of the crown; and what justice or mercy the people can expect from such a house of commons, common sense, I had almost said, common experience, may instruct. For this reason, Sir, if we have a mind to preserve our constitution; if we have a mind that parliament should ever be of any use to the king or his people; if we have a mind to prevent a parlia|ment's being a cumbersome clog to a good king, and a cruel instrument of oppression in the hands of a tyrannical one, we must pass a Jaw for limiting the number of officers in this house; and this we ought to be the more ardent to have speedily done, because if we are once caught in the share, it will be impossible for us ever to escape; for if a majority of this house should ever once come to consist of officers and placemen, it is not to be supposed they would pass a bill for their own exclusion. On the contrary, if they should entertain the least jealousy of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> being able to get themselves, or a majo|rity
<PB N="241" REF="013851_0772_0F9E28E6252696F0">
of such as themselves, chosen at a new election, they would, by the authority of a late precedent, continue themselves, or they would pass an excise-bill, or some such bill, for giving the court an absolute command over a majority of our elections, and thereby establish an arbitrary power of the most extensive, cruel, and tyrannical kind, I mean, an arbitrary power supported by a corrupt parliament and a numerous mercenary army. To prevent this, Sir, I rise up to second the motion made by my worthy friend.

<P>Lord <HI>Sandwich,</HI> on this occasion, speaks as follows:</P>
<P><Q>In antient times, my lords, nay, I may say, till after the restoration, we had no occasion for such bills. The crown had but a few lucrative employ|ments to bestow, and many of those it had at its disposal, were such as were generally granted for life; consequently, no minister could hope by such means to gain, much less to preserve, a corrupt majority in either house of parliament; and the impossibility of success prevented their making any such attempt. We had then no mercenary stand|ing army, nor had the crown any lucrative military commissions to dispose of. If an army was at any time raised for foreign service, no officer employed in that army could look upon his post as an estate for life; therefore, though a commission in the army was considered as an honour, it was never looked upon as a favour; but on the contrary, those landed gentlemen who had acquired a character in their country for conduct, courage, and military knowledge, were often solicited to accept of com|missions in the army which was to be raised, and when the service was over, they returned to live upon their estates in the country without being at any further expence to the public. We had then, my lords, but very few customs, and no excises; consequently a minister could not spread his excise-men over the whole kingdom to <HI>influence</HI> elections in counties, or to <HI>govern</HI> them in most of our inland boroughs; and the salaries of custom-house-officers
<PB N="243" REF="013851_0774_0F9E28EA569795A8">
were so trifling, that no man of any great character or fortune would accept of them; so that such officers had but very little influence in any of our sea-port towns. But now, my lords, the case is quite altered; the posts in the army, and in the collection of the public revenues, and the other places in the disposal of the crown, are become so numerous and so lucrative, that they must have a great influence upon the members of the other house, if there be no restraint upon the num|ber of placemen allowed to have seats in that house. This, I say, must be the consequence, unless we suppose, that men will judge and determine as im|partially in a case where they are to get 500<HI>l.</HI> or 1000<HI>l.</HI> a year, as in a case where they are to get or lose nothing by their judgment or determination; and to suppose this is so contrary to the nature of mankind, and to the established maxims of all soci|eties, that I am sure none of your lordships will make any such suppositions. Parliaments, we know, are designed to be a check upon ministers; we like|wise know, that almost every post in the disposal of the crown, is left to the arbitrary disposal of ministers; and we also know that no minister ever did or ever will give a lucrative post or employment to a man who opposes his measures in parliament. From late experience we know, that some of the highest officers in the kingdom have been dismissed for no other reason but because they disapproved of the measures pursued by our ministers, and had honour enough to declare their disapprobation in parliament. Can we then expect, my lords, that the other house will be a check upon the conduct of our ministers, as long as there is a majority in that house who enjoy, or expect, lucrative and honour|able
<PB N="244" REF="013851_0775_0F9E28EB240C16A0">
employments from the benevolence of these very ministers? I shall not say, that in such a case the members would all be corrupt in their determi|nations, but I will say, that in many cases they would be biassed in their judgments, and thereby induced to approve of what, in duty to their country, they ought to have disapproved of; or to put a nega|tive upon what, in duty to their country, they ought to have given their consent to. Therefore, my lords, if we intend that the other house should answer the end of its institution, by judging impar|tially, and determining wisely and justly in every case that comes before them, we must pass this bill, or such a bill as this; or we must pass a bill for taking from the crown the disposal of those posts and employments that are necessary for the execu|tive part of our government; and surely those lords who seem so mighty jealous of any incroachment upon the prerogative of the crown, will agree to the former rather than to the latter of these two expedients. The latter, I shall grant, would be an infringement of one of those prerogatives now enjoyed by the crown; but I cannot, for my life, see what the former has to do with the prerogative of the crown, nor can I conceive how any one pre|rogative of the crown is to be in the least affected by this bill. There is no confinement, nor the least restraint, proposed upon the power the king has to dispose of offices or employments. He may grant them as fully and freely as before: he may even grant them to members of parliament, notwithstand|ing any thing proposed to be enacted by this bill; and the member may enjoy the office or employ|ment so granted to him; only if it be such a one as is not excepted in this bill, he is not to be re|chosen.
<PB N="245" REF="013851_0776_0F9E28EBD4150978">
Is this, my lords, an infringement of any pre|rogative of the crown? Has the king a power to tell the people whom they are to chuse, or whom they are not to chuse? No, my lords; but the legislature has, and has already in many cases exercised that power. The people are already, by law, restrained from chusing a man for their representative who is not possessed of 600 <HI>l.</HI> or at least 300 <HI>l.</HI> a year: they are already restrained from chusing any man concerned in collecting the public revenue: they are already re|strained from chusing the high-sheriff to be their repre|sentative; and now they are to be restrained from chusing any placemen besides those excepted in the bill. This, 'tis granted, is a new restraint; but it can no more be said to be an infringement of the people's li|berties, than confining a madman can be said to be an infringement of his liberty; for if the people were not mad, or something worse, they never would chuse a man as the guardian of their liberties, who must either forfeit the lucrative post he enjoys, or betray his trust to ministers, who can, and probably will, take his post from him, if he does not; and who have always, by experience, been found to be the greatest enemies to the liberties of the people.</Q>
&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>No inconvenience, but great benefit, has accrued from that law which disables commissioners and offi|cers of our customs, or excise, from being members of the other house. Experience must therefore give a favourable opinion of this bill. Can it be said, that in the year 1693 we were influenced by any factious discontents? And yet in that year, such a bill as this, which was intitled, <HI>A Bill touching free and impartial Proceedings in Parliament,</HI> passed both houses; but by the advice of the ministers was re|fused the royal assent; as several others had been
<PB N="246" REF="013851_0777_0F9E28EC9B08A398">
during the beginning of that reign. Can it be sup|posed, that in the year 1701, we were governed by any factious discontents; and yet in the act then passed, there was an express clause for excluding all placemen from having seats in the house of commons after the settlement then established should take place; which clause met with the approbation not only both houses of parliament, but of the crown itself. And surely no man will derogate so much from the known courage of king <HI>William,</HI> as to say, that he would have allowed himself to be bubbled by any faction or party into a regulation which he thought would strike at the root of our constitution. This clause, it is true, was afterwards in the queen's time repealed; but I wish the noble peers who were the promoters of that repeal had considered a little more their own characters as well as the constitution of their country; for if they had, they might perhaps have made some such exceptions as are contained in this bill; but I am sure they would never have a|greed to and much less proposed a general and abso|lute repeal of that clause <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P>On occasion of the debate on the pension-bill, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1730-31, an oath was proposed to be taken by mem|bers, purging themselves of the guilt of receiving any pension from the crown. Several lords protested against its being rejected in their house;
<Q>because the bill would, if committed, have been regularly the subject of debate, and amendments might have been made as this house thought proper; and because the commons had passed the bill with so much honour to themselves; and because this bill only enforces the observation, and prevents the evasions of former laws.
<PB N="247" REF="013851_0778_0F9E28ED51D8B1F0">
By one of these laws, no person who has a pension from the crown during pleasure, can sit in the house of commons; but the effect of this law was or might have been evaded, in great measure, by grants of pensions for certain terms of years. To remedy this abuse, it was enacted by another law; that no person who enjoys a pension for any number of years, shall sit in that house, under certain penalties; but the effect of this law may be evaded by giving gratuities, or making annual presents; and the commons would find it difficult to obtain those accounts which can alone shew what pensions are paid to particular per|sons. By the laws now in force, whoever accepts any office or employment under the crown, cannot sit in that house, till he has been re-elected. But an office may be held by some person who is not a member of that house, in trust for one who is. The arguments used for the necessity of preserving an influence to the crown by the power of rewarding; are not to the present purpose, or if applied, they prove what is not much to the honour of this house; as rejecting this bill looks like approving all the evasions that have or can be invented or put in practice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Strictly speaking, all influence over either house, except that which arises from a sense of these duties which we owe to our king and country, is improper; for although this influence appears to be that of the crown, it may become virtually that of the minister; and if ever a corrupt minister should have the dispo|sition of places, and distribution of pensions, gratui|ties, and rewards, he may create such an influence, as shall effectually deprive the prince of the great advan|tage of knowing the true sense of the people, and a house of parliament being prevailed upon to approve such measures as the whole nation dislikes; he may,
<PB N="248" REF="013851_0779_0F9E28F069A1DE10">
for the sake of an unworthy servant, lose the affec|tions of his people, whilst he imagines that he both de|serves and possesses them; and this improper influ|ence will always be most exerted in the support of ill measures and weak ministers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The trust reposed in parliament is much greater than it was, in respect to those heavy taxes which have been for many years past, and which must be, for all succeeding times [unless the national debt could be paid] annually laid by parliament, and also the im|mense debts which have been contracted.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The service of the house of commons was for|merly a real service, therefore often declined, and al|ways paid for by the people; it is now no longer paid for, no longer declined, but sought after at a great expence. How far these considerations, with that of the vast increase of the civil-list, and of the debts con|tracted on it, deserve to enforce the reasons for exact|ing some stronger engagements, from members of the house of commons to those whom they are chosen to represent, is we think sufficiently obvious.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Although the multiplying of oaths ought to be avoided, yet an oath being the most solemn engage|ment men can lay under, we judge it on that account the more proper to be imposed; nor will the proba|bility of its being broke by the iniquity of mankind be an argument of greater force against this bill, than against any other law made for preventing any other crime <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P><Q>It is well known, my lords,
(says lord <HI>Chesterfield</HI> in the debate on a bill for making officers independent on the ministry, <HI>A.D.</HI> 1734 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 198.</NOTE>) that there are many officers of the army who have nothing, or at least very little to subsist on but their commissions; and it
<PB N="249" REF="013851_0780_0F9E28F18DD780B8">
is likewise well known that there are many gentle|men of the army now in both houses of parliament. There are now, my lords, more officers of the army in each house of parliament than there were when we had on foot an army of above 60,000 men: These are facts which will not, I believe, be controverted. It is, I do not know how, become of late years a pre|vailing opinion, that the only way of getting prefer|ment in the army is to have a seat in the other house of parliament: This, it is true, my lords, must be an erroneous opinion. It is impossible that any man can justly and honourably acquire any preferment in the army by his behaviour in either house of parlia|ment, and therefore this must be an opinion for which I hope there never was any ground. I am sure there can be no ground for it under his present majesty; but erroneous as it is, it is become a gene|ral opinion, and we know that mankind always were, and always will be governed and influenced by general opinions and prejudices; and according as the pre|valence of this opinion increases, we may expect an increase of the number of officers in both houses of parliament. We may expect, my lords, that in future times, as soon as any gentleman has once got a commission in the army, he will next employ all his money and credit, and all his friends to procure him|self a seat in parliament; he will perhaps pawn the last shilling's worth he has in the world, besides his commission, in order to procure himself a seat in the other house of parliament; and how dangerous it may be to our constitution to have such a man de|pending for the continuance of that commission upon some future enterprizing minister, I leave to your lordships to judge. No man has a better opinion than I have of the gentlemen who are at present the
<PB N="250" REF="013851_0781_0F9E28F1DC553068">
officers of our army; but I must say, that I think it too hard a trial even for their virtue, especially in this degenerate age, to have it in the power of a desperate minister to tell them upon occasion of an important question in parliament,
'If you do not vote, Sir, as I direct, you shall starve.'</Q></P>
<P>In the debate on the famous pension-bill, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1739 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB, LORDS, VI.372.</NOTE>, lord <HI>Walpole</HI> observed, that a bill with the same title had been four times sent up to the lords, and as often rejected. That it was an affront to the lords to send them the same bill five times. That it is dangerous to make alterations. [The bill, how|ever, was no alteration, but intended to inforce an old law.] That the bill supposes corruption in the other house, which is a slander on the house, and a reflexion on the government. That it is impossible there should be any pensioning; because no pension can be granted but by warrant from his majesty, and all monies are to be accounted for to king and parliament. [So that, in short; corruption is, like the stories of ghosts and goblings, a mere non-entity, at which only silly people are sacred.] That besides, the ministry have no inclination to corrup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the members of the house of commons.
<Q>I have the honour, says his lordship, to be nearly related to some of those employed in the administration: From thence I have had an oppor|tunity of knowing their most secret thoughts; and from thence I have formed my opinion. Therefore, if it is neither in the inclination nor in the power of any one employed in the administration to corrupt the members of the other house, what occasion can we have, would it not be altogether imprudent in us to make an alteration in one of the most funda|mental
<PB N="251" REF="013851_0782_0F9E28F29834C318">
parts of our constitution, in order to guard against a grievance which is neither felt, nor can be, in his present majesty's reign, so much as supposed?</Q></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Talbot</HI> answered lord <HI>Walpole,</HI> that the com|mons, by sending up the bill, shewed, That they believed not only the possibility, but the reality of corruption. That there were two statutes before cal|culated for the same purpose; but
<Q>that ministerial craft working upon abandoned prostitution could evade them.</Q>
That the commons, if in earnest, might justly be offended, if the lords rejected the bill, which might produce a rupture between the houses, and might set the whole nation against the lords; if the commons meant only to delude their constituents by a pretended zeal against corruption, trusting, that the lords would throw out the bill, would it be con|sistent with the dignity of the house of peers to be accessary to such abominable craft. That a private pension is not a reward of merit, but a breach of trust; and to reject the bill would be giving a sanction to breach of trust. That it could not be said, that the lords passing the bill was a slur on the commons, when the commons originated it. That a parliament 2 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. passed an act to cancel all the debts the king had contracted upon loans; and the historians account for this iniquitous proceeding from that par|liament's being filled with the king's servants, with whom justice had not so much weight as complaisance to the crown.</P>
<P><Q>The numbers of placemen in that parliament, (says his lordship)
are not specified; but I believe they did not amount to near three hundred in both houses; nor is there mention made of a single pen|sioner. The parliament, stigmatized by the name of the pensionary parliament, proposed an expurgatory
<PB N="252" REF="013851_0783_0F9E28F3527E2180">
oath to clear themselves from that aspersion, con|taining many particulars, one of which was, that each member should swear he had never given his vote in parliament for any reward or promise what|soever. I sincerely wish, that to gratify the people the same or such another oath should now be taken; and as the oath proposed by this bill will, I think, be rather more effectual, therefore, I am for the bill's being committed, and hope it will be passed into a law <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, VI.375.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To pretend</Q>
[alluding to lord <HI>Walpole</HI>'s speech]
<Q>that we are not at present in any danger from the private pensions that may be given to members of the other house, must appear absurd to every man that considers the nature of ministers, or the nature of mankind. My lords, it is a danger we can never be free from; nor can we sufficiently guard against, as long as it is in the power of a minister to give, or of a member to receive. It is absolutely necessary for a minister to have the consent or approbation of parliament in almost every step of his conduct. Therefore from the very nature of ministers, we may suppose, that if he cannot obtain such consent or approbation by his authority, he will endeavour to obtain it by his power; and from the nature of man|kind we must suppose, that among such a number of men as are in the other house, the minister will always find some ready enough to prostitute their consent or approbation for a considerable bribe, or annual pension. Thus we must always be exposed to this danger; and now we are a great deal more exposed to it, than ever we were heretofore; because our ministers now have infinitely more to give, and
<PB N="253" REF="013851_0784_0F9E28F453D26EB0">
custom or example has, I am afraid, greatly added to the number of those, that are ready to receive <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS. VI.383.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By the very act of settlement itself, my lords, it was expressly enacted, amongst other things, That no person having a pension from the crown, should serve as a member of the house of commons; and though this clause was in general repealed by an act of the 4th and 5th of queen <HI>Anne,</HI> yet it was then again thought so reasonable to exclude pensioners from having seats in the other house, that it was a-new enacted, That no person having a pension from the crown during pleasure, should be capable of being a member of any future house of commons; and by an act of the 1st of the late king, their in|capacity was farther extended to all persons having any pension from the crown, for any term or number of years, either in their own names or in the name of any other person in trust for them, or for their benefit. Thus your lordships see, that by the laws now in being, all persons who have pensions from the crown during pleasure, or for any term or num|ber of years, are rendered incapable of having seats in the other house; and by these laws, great penalties are inflicted upon those who presume to break through them. But as no provision has been made by either of these laws for discovering secret offenders, and as every man must be sensible that such pensions may be given privately, the gentlemen of the other house have thought it, and I hope your lordships will think it necessary, to provide the best remedy that can be thought of for this defect, which is the chief, and indeed the sole intention of this bill. I cannot help t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">refore being astonished at its being pretended,
<PB N="254" REF="013851_0785_0F9E2828E1524DD0">
that this bill will occasion any alteration, or innova|tion in our constitution; and there is nothing con|vinces me more of the necessity there is for passing it, than the circumstances of the noble lords, who I find oppose it. To the honour of the administration in the first year of the late king, I must observe, that the law passed at that time for excluding pensioners from the other house, was introduced by a secretary of state, and approved by most of those in the admi|nistration; and it was prudent and right in them to do so. A minister that has no intention to make use of bribery and corruption, has no occasion to oppose any bill that can be thought of, for preventing such infamous and illegal practices; and therefore, when I find such a bill opposed, by those who are the known friends of a minister, it will always be a pre|vailing argument with me, not only to think that there is a present and pressing necessity for such a bill, but also, that the bill proposed will be in some measure effectual. It will at least raise the price of prostitutes, because the more risk a man runs, the higher wages he will of course expect; and the higher you raise the price of those who are liable to be corrupted, the more difficult will every future minister find it to corrupt, notwithstanding the many and great boons our ministers have now to bestow; and then they must think of gaining the consent or approbation of parliament by their autho|rity in persuading, and not by their power in corrupt|ing <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, VI.384.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I find (says the earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI>) some lords are, upon this occasion, extremely apprehensive of corrupting the morals of the people, by a multiplicity of new oaths,
<PB N="255" REF="013851_0786_0F9E2829E5684F28">
I wish the same apprehensions had prevailed, when such an infinite number of oaths were contrived, for collect|ing our customs and taxes. Most of these oaths are to be taken by multitudes of people, and in cases where there are great temptations for perjury. The oath now proposed, is to be taken by none, but members of the other house; and the temptations to perjury can never be great or frequent, but when our consti|tution is in the utmost danger. It is therefore some|thing strange, that we should be so little apprehensive of corrupting the morals of the people, by a multi|plicity of oaths, when we are contriving methods for preserving the revenue of our sovereigns, and so very apprehensive of the like effect, when we are contriv|ing methods for preserving the constitution and liber|ties of our country. A foreigner, upon considering this behaviour, would be apt to judge we had very little concern about the latter, provided we could but enjoy a share of the former; and if we should reject this bill, without much Letter reasons than I have yet heard against it, I fear most of our own people will join in forming the same false opinion of this honourable and august assembly. Your lordships must be all sensible how prevalent the jealousy at present is, of there being a great number of pen|sioners in parliament: the gentlemen of the other house have endeavoured to allay that jealousy, and to vindicate the honour of their assembly, by sending us up this bill. If it should be thrown out here, what will the nation think? Will it not be generally supposed that this is the house, in which the number of pensioners prevails, and that here the pensions have the most infallible effect? Or perhaps it will be supposed, that there are pensioners in the other house as well as in this, but that the pensioners in the
<PB N="256" REF="013851_0787_0F9E282AEFE732E8">
other, for the sake of recommending themselves to their constituents, had leave from their masters to agree to this bill, because their masters knew they could depend upon the number and submission of their pensioners in this, for throwing it out. I am very sensible, my lords, there is no real ground for either of these suppositions; but those without doors, who do not know the reasons upon which your lordships proceed, when they find a bill rejected which makes no alteration in our constitution, which does not so much as make an alteration in any former law, which contains nothing but an inforcement of the laws in being against pensioners; such persons, I say, may think they have reason to make one or other of these suppositions; and should not we be extremely cautious of giving the least shadow of reason for judging so un|worthily of our assembly <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, VI.388.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P><Q>My lords, as the laws now in being for excluding pensioners from the other house, must to every man that considers them, appear to be altogether inef|fectual, if this bill be rejected, I shall, even in my time, if I live but a very few years, expect to see the other house full of pensioners. I shall expect to see a minister in that house, out of a wantonness of power, by his single <HI>veto,</HI> or the monosyllable NO, throw out a bill of the utmost importance, without design|ing to give his slaves so much as one reason for what he obliges them to do. This indeed, if it should ever happen, I shall look upon as a sign of his power, but not of his prudence; and I may prophesy, that if ever a minister should get such a power over the other house, his power in <HI>this</HI> will be as absolute and equally insolent <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 389.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="013851_0788_0F9E282B15F54AC8">The bishop of <HI>Salisbury [Sherlocke]</HI> opposed the bill, because it gave the commons the means of finding out transgressors more effectually. Perhaps his good lordship might think this was taking the business of reforming mankind out of the hands of the bishops, whose indefatigable labours, in season and out of sea|son, in word and doctrine, in teaching and preach|ing, are equal to the pulling down of any strong holds of Satan. See bishop <HI>Burnet</HI>'s panegyric on the diligence of the clergy, at the conclusion of the HISTORY OF HIS OWN TIMES.</P>
<P>By this bill, says the bishop, the commons are to become
<Q>superior to the chief branch of the legisla|ture, to the crown itself; for they are to judge of the actions of the crown, and may determine, that a well-merited reward, given by the crown for the most eminent public services, was a corrupt reward, given for a gentleman's corrupt behaviour in their assembly.</Q></P>
<P>Here his good lordship seems, with submission, to make a distress where there is none. For the supposed eminently serviceable gentleman had nothing to do but quit his seat in the house, and then the crown might give him a pension of 100,000<HI>l.</HI> a year. But it does not seem easy to understand why a bishop should be so zealous about this supposed encroachment on the crown, so long as it did not break in upon the power of the king to manufacture parsons into bishops.</P>
<P>By what follows, one would imagine his lordship was disposed to be merry. <Q>If, says he, the other house should once render themselves superior to the crown, they would of course become superior to this house likewise, and would soon engross, as they have done before, the whole power of our govern|ment.
<PB N="258" REF="013851_0789_0F9E282DE9C1D1C0">
They would either vote this house useless, [what a dreadful thing it would be if they should vote the inestimable bishops useless!]
as they have once done already, or they would render it insigni|ficant, by making it entirely subservient to them.</Q>
All this power the commons would acquire by the single circumstance of having power to demand an oath of their members, that they were not the mini|ster's hirelings.</P>
<P>The bishop afterwards expresses an anxiety about too many oaths, as if corruption were not as bad as perjury; but he says nothing about too many unintelligible and self-contradictory articles to be sub|scribed by the clergy.
<Q>The laws of this kingdom, says the bishop, have always been extremely cautious of subjecting a man to an oath, in any case where his interest may be concerned.</Q>
Therefore the good bishop ought to have been a great enemy to clerical subscription; for that, surely, is subjecting a man to an oath, where his interest is concerned, (so is his taking the oaths to the government.) Yet the lan|guage of the bishops is, subscribe, or starve.</P>
<P><Q>The oath proposed by this bill, says the bishop, is, I think, such a one as can be understood by no man.
[Is it more unintelligible, my good lord, than the <HI>Athanasian</HI> creed, or the doctrine of predes|tination to eternal torments; which is so <HI>full of sweet, pleasant, and comfortable matter</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the XVIIth article.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>Some readers may observe, that these remarks are rather <HI>ad hominem,</HI> than answers to the bishop's objec|tions. True: but the bishop's objections are so frivolous, and besides so peculiarly unsuitable to the character of a bishop, who ought to have rejoiced in
<PB N="259" REF="013851_0790_0F9E282F2CCD0650">
an opportunity for setting his face against corruption, that my treating him and his objections with <HI>contempt,</HI> where every friend of virtue and his country has a right to express <HI>indignation,</HI> ought to be considered as no small degree of candour. For the same reason I take no notice of his pretence, that it must be difficult to determine, what is a corrupt pension; that the in|nocent would have been in danger from this bill; that there was no danger from placemen or pensioners in the house of commons; that neither king nor ministry, were capable of corrupting any members of the com|mons; that those who are for putting a stop to cor|ruption, are enemies to the constitution; that the opposers of <HI>Ch.</HI> Ist's tyranny&punc; were only a disaffected party, &amp;c. So much for a specimen of pontifical politics&mdash;<HI>sic digerit omina Calchas.</HI> VIRG. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, VI.400.</NOTE></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Carteret</HI> observed, that nothing would cast a worse slur upon the house of peers, than their re|jecting this bill; that corruption cannot be too soon guarded against; for that the only time to guard against it is, before it becomes prevalent, as after a majority in either house becomes corrupt, it will be impossible to get a good bill against corruption passed; that 99 persons in every hundred throughout the kingdom, thought there was real danger from cor|ruption; that the passing of the bill would quiet the minds of the people, &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>I shall conclude (says he) with observing to your lordships, that if you reject it, all those who think we are in danger from corruption, will conclude, that it is already become impossible to guard against it by any legal means, and will therefore begin to think of some other method for preserving our consti|tution,
<PB N="260" REF="013851_0791_0F9E282F93D817E8">
which may prove of dangerous consequence to the illustrious family, now upon our throne.</Q></P>
<P>On the same occasion, the duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> spoke as follows:</P>
<P><Q>My lords, we are now upon a bill, for putting an end to, or at least preventing, one sort of corruption in the other house; and from the opposition the bill meets with here, and the imaginary dangers that were suggested for supporting, or rather excusing that opposition; those who are not personally acquainted with the noble lords, who have spoke upon that side of the question, would I think be apt to suppose their opinion to be either, that corruption is now become a necessary evil, without which the forms of our government could not be preserved, or that it is an evil of very little consequence, and not at all incompatible with the subsistence of a free govern|ment. Corruption my lords, has always hitherto been allowed to be vile, to be dangerous. I have for my own part discouraged it in all stations: I shall always disdain the obedience or the parasitical sort of assent, that is to be gained only by corruption, and I have always been sorry, when I have observed, it was not equally discouraged by others; for if it were no way encouraged by those in high stations, it would never be possible for the mode in any country to cover that infamy, which naturally attends the corrupted; nor would the quality of the offender ever atone for the wretched meanness of the offence. Corruption, my lords, is of all dangers the greatest our constitution can be exposed to, and the most to be apprehended. Its approach is imperceptible, but its blow, if not prevented, is fatal; and you cannot prevent its blow, unless you prevent its ap|proach. The laws now in being for excluding
<PB N="261" REF="013851_0792_0F9E28305A587220">
pensioners from having seats in the other house, are designed as a safeguard, against corruption's entering in one shape at least within the walls of that house; and when we are considering whether these laws ought to be enforced, we have no occasion for examining into late measures, or for supposing that any late practices have been made use of for cor|rupting the members of either house. We have now as much reason to guard against the approach of corruption as we had when these laws were made; therefore we are now to consider only the laws themselves, and if they appear insufficient, they ought to be amended, whether any corrupt prac|tices have lately been made use of or not. That these laws are insufficient for the end intended, must, I think, appear to any one that peruses them. There are penalties, 'tis true, inflicted upon pensi|oners that shall presume to sit or vote in the other house; but it is evident that these penalties can never be recovered, because the fact can never be proved. A pension or a bribe may be given in such a manner, that even he who gives it can be no direct witness against the receiver; and it is always given in such a secret manner that the criminal may have good reason to think his crime can never be discovered. For this reason no penalty you can inflict will ever have a great effect; and this makes it necessary, in cases of suspicion, to require an oath from the party suspected. I shall not say, my lords, that the oath required by this bill will have all the effect that could be wished. There may be some so abandoned as to despise the religious ceremony of an oath; but it will have an effect upon a great many; and even the most abandoned will be shy of denying their having a pension upon oath in the
<PB N="262" REF="013851_0793_0F9E28311465F838">
very face, perhaps, of the man who pays them their pensions. Nay, even prudence itself will make men shy of being guilty of perjury, lest the concealment of their crimes should afterwards be imputed to them as a favour, and made use of as a handle for obliging them to do as much dirty work afterwards, without a pension, as they had done before for the sake of a pension. It is an old and a true proverb, That when I trust a man with my secret, I make him my master. An avaritious, or an extravagant and necessitous man may accept of iniquitous wages from a minister, and yet he would not, perhaps, chuse to be such an absolute slave to that minister, as he must be, should he put it in his power to con|vict him of perjury. Therefore the oath prescribed by this bill will certainly have a very great effect; and as the laws proposed to be enforced by this bill evi|dently appear to be insufficient, this method of en|forcing them ought to be chosen, at least till a more effectual one can be thought on <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P><Q>My lords, I look upon the present question to be a trial of skill, the fate of which is to determine whether or no our constitution is hereafter to be destroyed by corruption, and the people reduced to the fatal necessity of endeavouring to restore it by the sword. If this should ever come to be the un|lucky fate of this nation, those who now oppose our making use of legal means for securing our con|stitution, whilst it is yet in our power, will have no great reason to rejoice in their past conduct. Let us consider, my lords, the vast sums of money that are now at the disposal, or under the direction of the crown; the infinite number of lucrative posts,
<PB N="263" REF="013851_0794_0F9E2831DA4B5E78">

Let us, I say, my lords, consider these things, and we must acknowledge that the present danger we are in of having our parliaments converted into a <HI>Turkish</HI> divan, is far from being imaginary; and when we are under such well grounded apprehensions, shall we rack our invention for visionary dangers, in order to ex|cuse our agreeing to any method for guarding against a danger so real, and which may, upon the first change of ministers or measures, become inevitable and irresistible <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

and render even the bribe precarious; no member could be guilty of taking a bribe, because there could be no temptation to it. And he thought it would diminish the prerogative of the crown, there|fore he could not agree to the bill.</P>
<P>He was answered by lord <HI>Chesterfield,</HI> that there was a suspicion of some such practices, because that house had frequently sent this bill to the lords. To pretend that this bill encroaches upon the prerogative of the crown, is somewhat strange. Has the crown a prerogative to infringe the laws? To say so, is destroying the credit and authority of the crown; but the crown has nothing to do with pensions, it is the minister's affair. Men of family and fortune may be avaricious or luxurious, and may not think of the dangerous consequences of corruption; certainly if they did, there would be no occasion to make laws against it; it would appear so horrible, that no man would allow it to approach him. The corrupted ought to consider, that they do not sell their country only: that perhaps they may disregard; but they sell likewise themselves: they become the bond-slaves of the cor|ruptor; who corrupts them, not for their sakes, but for his own. Therefore if people would but consider, they would always reject the offer with disdain. But history shews, that to satisfy the immediate cravings of some infamous appetite, the alluring bait is swal|lowed. This makes it necessary in every free state to contrive, if possible, to prevent corruption. The sooner a remedy is applied, the less will be our dan|ger of falling into that fatal distemper; from which no free state, where it has once become general, has ever yet recovered <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P><PB N="265" REF="013851_0796_0F9E283398ABB450">In the committee on the bill for taxing places and pensions, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1744, Mr. <HI>Archer</HI> spoke as follows;</P>
<P>'Sir, There is a short but material amendment which, I think, should be made to this question. It is so adapted to the necessities of the present times, and so much for the honour of the committee, that I am satisfied it will be agreeable to you, and to every other gentleman here. We are now so happy as to enjoy a most profound calm without the least ruffle of wind or weather. All opposition lies hushed; but least a storm should soon arise, I am for making use of this happy juncture, this favour|able opportunity, of proving to the world that this extraordinary unanimity does not proceed from any selfish views or expectations, but from a true disin|terested public spirit; and if the amendment which I shall beg leave to offer, should pass with the same unanimity, as all other questions have hitherto done, it will be a proof of it beyond contradiction. Sir, what I propose, is to lay a double tax upon places and pensions in ease of the landed interest of this kingdom; and who is there in this committee that can have any reasonable objection against it? As for the gentlemen in place, they cannot but be sensible what an uncertain and precarious situation they are now in; and that they hold their places by the weakest of all tenures, by nothing but the smiles of a great man, which are more fickle and inconstant than those of fortune. Perhaps it may soon be proper for some of them to follow the ex|ample of a noble earl, and resign; therefore it can|not be worth their while to oppose it. Besides, it may be some consolation to them that their landed estates will receive some benefits from their places which they themselves are so likely to lose; it is
<PB N="266" REF="013851_0797_0F9E283414328458">
impossible, therefore, that any objection can come from them. As for the gentlemen who are to suc|ceed them, if they are the same as I have heard mentioned, they are persons of such exalted notions of honour and patriotism, that you could not put a higher affront upon them than to imagine, that the sordid lucre of the place has any share in their thoughts. No, Sir, their patriotism, like virtue, is its own reward, and the only one they desire; and therefore, it is equally certain, they will not oppose it. And as for the great man who has the disposal of these places, it will be doing him a very fignal piece of service; for by lessening the value of places, you will lessen the number of candidates, and so far take off from that immense trouble and fatigue, which he is forced daily, nay, hourly to undergo from innumerable solicitations, visits, let|ters, messages, and importunities; and besides this, it will be a great honour to his administration, not to stand in need of the mean assistance of places to support it. Those gentlemen, therefore, who have any regard for his ease or his honour, must all espouse this motion. As for the rest of the house, they are country gentlemen, who feel too much the weight and burden of this tax upon their lands not to wish for some relief; it is, therefore, fairly to be con|clud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, that neither they nor any other gentlemen in the committee, can disapprove of this amendment. But, Sir, if all these reasons, strong as they are&punc; more particularly at this juncture, were laid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the case, the thing is so evidently right and jus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in itself, that it cannot be opposed. Sir, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fundamental rule of justice, as well as policy, that all taxes for the support of the government, should be laid with equality; and how can it be pretended
<PB N="267" REF="013851_0798_0F9E2835B75FE740">
that 4 <HI>s.</HI> in the pound upon land, and no more upon places, is an equal tax? The land is taxed in pro|portion to the rent, which is generally the full value, every body being desirous to let their estates for as much as they can get. The place is taxed in pro|portion to the salary, which is seldom a quarter part of the income, the fees and perquisites generally amounting to five or six time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as much. The rent is subject to deductions for repairs and losses by the tenants; the salary is subject to neither. Nay, the land-owner is sometimes forced to pay the tax for rent which he does not receive; whereas the placeman never pays it, but upon the receipt of his salary. The land subjects the owner to the expence and trouble of serving many offices, particularly the high-sheriff's, grand-jury-man's and others; the place is so far from being liable to any of them, that it is of itself an indemnification and excuse against all. Then how can it be said, that this is acting fairly and impartially? It is therefore high time for us to rectify this unequal oppressive method of taxation; and if you lay 8 <HI>s.</HI> in the pound upon places and pensions, it is very obvious how many advantages will flow from it. 1st, It will in some measure operate as a place-bill; for by lessening the value of the places, it will lessen that undue influ|ence which is supposed to arise from them. 2dly, It will coroborate and strengthen that favourite law, the qualification act; for if it is necessary that the members of this house should have an estate in land to a certain value, the less charge you lay upon the land, the more likely they will be to fulfil and answer the intent of that good law. 3dly, It will in like manner fortify the laws of election; for if every freeholder is required to have 40 <HI>s.</HI> a year,
<PB N="268" REF="013851_0799_0F9E28369BBC24B8">
to entitle him to a vote, do not take away a fifth part of it from him by a tax of 4 <HI>s.</HI> in the pound upon the land, but rather lay it upon places and pensions. In short, Sir, almost all the good laws made for the freedom and independency of parlia|ment, will be in some measure assisted by this amend|ment. But I do agree, that some places are of too small value to admit of a double tax, as the excise officers, and others, of 50<HI>l.</HI> a year and under; but they might easily be provided for out of the contin|gencies of the year; and a few other places are of too great importance and service to the state to undergo any diminution, I mean the judges, upon whom I am so far from levying a double tax, that I would rather except them from all taxes whatsoever; for I think it a great dishonour and reproach to any government not to support their magistrates with splendor and dignity; and if any other exceptions should be thought proper, they might all be pro|vided for in the body of the bill. But upon places in general, a double tax is the true and just propor|tion to be observed; and that you may be fully satisfied that this amendment is not only founded upon reason but also upon precedent, I shall beg leave to refer you to an act of parliament made 29 and 30 <HI>Ch.</HI> II. when, for carrying on the war vigo|rously against <HI>France,</HI> 1<HI>s.</HI> in the pound was laid upon personal estates, and 3<HI>s.</HI> upon pensions; and it is amazing to me, how so wise and useful a law came to be so much neglected. Perhaps, Sir, some gentlemen might think it better to appropriate a greater share of the profits of places and pensions to the service of the war, which I am far from disap|proving of; and indeed I have heard, they have already done so in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Turkey</HI>; but at present
<PB N="269" REF="013851_0800_0F9E2837CE028C40">
I chuse rather to move it in this unexceptionable way to avoid all dispute, and to preserve that una|nimity which has hitherto so happily subsisted amongst us. The amendment, therefore, that I beg leave to offer is, to insert in the question, after the 4<HI>s.</HI> in the pound upon lands, &amp;c. these words,
<Q>and the sum of eight shillings in the pound upon places and pensions.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of Qualifications for Members of Parliament.</HEAD>
<P>THE wisdom of our ancestors, and their anxiety about the safety of the state, put them upon endeavouring, by all possible means, to prevent the mischiefs likely to arise from bribery and corrup|tion; and, for that purpose, suggested the necessity of place and pension-bills, as we have seen in the forego|ing chapter. To exclude corruption still more effec|tually, they added qualification-acts. They thought a member of parliament, who was himself a man of for|tune, would both be less liable to ministe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ial influence, as being above want, and likewise would be more soli|tous about the fate of his country, as having him|self a considerable prize at stake. On this subject, various views are to be taken, and various considerations to be attended to. Experience shews us, that men are not always more or less obnoxious to corruption according to their circumstances; and that their greediness of the public money regulates more by their dispositions than their fortunes. The man, who loves money, whether with a view to hoard or to dissi|pate it, is the dangerous man, either as an elector or
<PB N="270" REF="013851_0801_0F9E2837D8405BD8">
a member. And of the two, the spend thrift is more likely to sell his country for money, than the miser.</P>
<P>Again, it must be owned, that in the present dis|orderly state of things, qualification-acts are likely to be of advantage; for every little check on corruption is wanted, and all too little.</P>
<P>But if representation were put upon an adequate foot, the power of commissioning legislators so divided, that it would be impossible to fill the house by corrupt means (which it would be, if it were necessary to bribe 206,000, the major half of 410,000, instead of 5,723; see vol. i. p. 39, <HI>et seq.</HI>) and if parliaments were annual, with exclusion by rotation, &amp;c. it would be of much less consequence, that electors and mem|bers were men in independent circumstances, than as things are now.</P>
<P>No minister would find it for his advantage to tempt either elector, or member; and if there were no buyer, there could be no sellers. The only advantage, which would then appear to kings, lords, commons, mini|sters, electors, members, &amp;c. would be that of the public; and that advantage every man would plainly see he might as well pursue as not; because his own advantage would be included in that of the public; and he would find that he could no other way seek his own private advantage, than by consulting that of the public.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans,</HI> in the republican times, shew, that they thought it useful to see that those, who were entrusted with the care of the general safety, should be men of property. Accordingly, the qualification of a <HI>Roman</HI> senator was 6458<HI>l.</HI> 6 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> raised by <HI>Augustus</HI> to 9687 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI>&mdash;which if a senator impair|ed, he lost his seat <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sueton.</HI> IN AUG. <HI>Cic.</HI> XIII.5.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The qualification-act, requiring members for coun|ties to be men of at least 600<HI>l.</HI> a year, and burgesses of 300<HI>l.</HI> in land, was passed in the year 1711. when the majority of the commons were tories <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burn.</HI> IV.316.</NOTE>. <Q>The de|sign, <HI>Burnet</HI> says, was to exclude merchants and tra|ders.

<P>It was enacted 9 <HI>Anne,</HI> that every member for a county should have an estate at least for his own life of 600<HI>l.</HI> a year, and every member for city, or borough, 300<HI>l.</HI> (a most ridiculous difference! as all members have equal weight in the house) and that every elec|tion of a person not so qualified, should be void; every candidate, if called upon at his election, to be obliged to give in his estate upon oath.

<P><HI>A. D.</HI> 1713. the commons, in a grand commitee, considered the act of the ninth year of her majesty's reign, intitled, <HI>An Act for securing the Freedom of Parliaments, by farther qualifying the Members to sit in the House of Commons</HI>; and came to the follow|ing resolutions:&mdash;
<Q>I. That notwithstanding the oath taken by any candidate on or after any election, his qualification may be afterwards examined into. II. That the person whose qualification is expressly objected to in any petition relating to his election, shall, within fifteen days after the petition read, give
<PB N="272" REF="013851_0803_0F9E283955C8B8A0">
to the clerk of the house of commons a paper signed by himself, containing a rental or particular of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments, whereby he makes out his qualification; of which any person concerned may have a copy. III. That of such lands, tenements, or hereditaments, whereof the party hath been in possession for three years before the election, he shall also insert in the same paper, from what person, and by what conveyance or act in law, he claims and derives the same; and also the considera|tion if any paid, and the names and places of abode of the witnesses to such conveyance and payment. IV. That if a sitting member shall think fit to question the qualification of a petitioner, he shall, within fif|teen days after the petition read, leave notice thereof in writing with the clerk of the house of commons; and the petitioner shall, within fifteen days after such notice, leave with the said clerk of the house the like account in writing of his qualification, as is required from a sitting member. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P>The eldest sons of peers, the members for the uni|versities, and the 45 members for <HI>North Britain,</HI> are exempted from the qualification-law. Yet I should think, it would not be easy to shew why any man, whether he be the son of a duke or a cobler, should be trusted in a station, where he is likely to be tempted, if he is in circumstances which render him obnoxious to temptation. Nor is it easy to imagine, why a member for <HI>Middlesex</HI> must shew his circum|stances to be above temptation, while a member for <HI>Clackmannan,</HI> whose vote weighs as heavy as any other's, may be a dependent beggar.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="013851_0804_0F9E283A1C530D88">An estate, or income, for life only, is not a security against corruption. Yet it is admited as a qualifica|tion.

<P><HI>A. D.</HI> 1761, a bill was brought into parliament, by which it was proposed, it should be enacted, that every member, before he sat, or voted, should be obliged to give into the house of commons a rental or schedule of his estate, with all particulars, signed and sworn to, on pain of a severe fine in case of falsification, to be levied by any person suing for the same as an action for debt, in spite of privilege, &amp;c. And, on every dimunition of his annual income, during the sitting of parliament, to give an account of the same to the house. Eldest sons, or heirs apparent of peers or lords of parliament, members for the two universities, and for <HI>Scotland,</HI> (for no known reason) to be excepted from this salu|tary regulation; as if 50 or 60 members obnoxious to bribery were no grievance.</P>
<P>But when this bill came to be passed into a law, it was so amended (the wrong way) that it might as well not have been passed. For, first, it was not to be in force, till the determination of the then sitting parliament; and besides, it was so whittled down, that a member might give in a mock schedule or ren|tal to the house, in the same manner as at his electi|on; and he could not be challenged concerning his qualification any more during that parliament: Where|as by the bill, as first proposed, it would have been very dangerous to give a mock-qualification for seven years; and members would have been at any time li|able to be accused of having reduced themselves to a condition obnoxious to bribery.</P>

<HEAD>BOOK II. Of taxing the Colonies.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. That the Object, our Ministers have had in View in taxing the Colonies, was, enlarging the Power of the Court, by increasing the Number of Places and Pensions for their Dependants.</HEAD>
<P>THE subject of our late broil with our colonies, the greatest evil that has arisen in the state for these many centuries past, is doubly entitled to a place in a work which contains an enquiry into public abuses, both as being itself one of the grossest <HI>abuses,</HI> and also as being particularly the consequence of <HI>par|liamentary</HI> corruption.</P>
<P>It is the exorbitant <HI>voraciousness</HI> of the <HI>court-tools,</HI> the great <HI>number</HI> of those needy persons, and the fear our ministers are constantly subject to, from the hos|tility of their opponents, with the consciousness, that they hold their places by the tenure of <HI>interest,</HI> and not of merit; that has lately misled our ministry into the most fatal measure of laying taxes upon our colo|nies, who have no representation in the house of commons which taxes them. Our ministers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> made a breach perhaps never to be closed; they
<PB N="275" REF="013851_0806_0F9E283D109F4790">
have opened a wound perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> never more to be healed&mdash;all to get a few more <HI>places</HI> for their wretched de|pendents.</P>
<P>Upon the modern plan of government, <HI>viz. Buying</HI> every necessary vote, a <HI>British</HI> ministry must be so dis|tressed for money, as to be at any time ready to dig up the very foundations of <HI>Pandaemonium,</HI> if they thought there were either gold or diamonds to be found in that soil. Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, when <HI>Walpole</HI> was at his wit's end for money to stop the mouths of his harpies, it was suggested to him, that the colonies could afford to pay taxes as well as the mother country, and that from thence a large income might in time be raised for the use of elec|tioneering and pensioning, and that there might be many good posts and places <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stabli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed in the colonies for the advantage of the court-tools; even <HI>Walpole</HI> had, on that occasion, some consideration. He an|swered to those, who made this proposal, That the colonists, by the profits of our trade with them, <HI>enabled</HI> us to pay <HI>our</HI> taxes, which was the same as paying taxes to the mother country; and that, by the restrictions, under which we have laid their commerce, all their money com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to the mother-country; and the mother-country can at most have but their all. His successors, however, have seen this object in a different light, and have considered a small advantage to themselves as of more consequence than a great be|nefit to the public. But so long as we see such villain|ous uses made of the public money by our ministers, we ought to discourage all the arts we see them using for bringing money into the treasury, or increasing their own influence, and therefore we ought to oppose their taxing the colonies, as an abuse, in which we are deeply concerned, and which may prove fatal to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, as well as to the colonists.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="013851_0807_0F9E283EB2A06360">Bad ministers always shew an inclination for multi|plying taxes. It gives an opportunity for them to embezzle; for in much handling of money, some will stick to the fingers. And a bad ministry want, above all things, money, to dole about, in order to keep in power. If they gain their present point, the spoils of the colonies will help up the supplies, and the in|fluence of the court will be increased; they will have more trumpeters to defend their measures; success will sanctify rapine and bribery; the free spirit of the colonists (who seem at present to possess a larger measure of that virtue, than the mother-country) will be broken by the iron rod of oppression; and Cor|ruption, like another leud <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> as described by <HI>Dryden,</HI>

will sail in triumph through the whole <HI>British</HI> empire in <HI>Europe, Asia</HI> and <HI>America</HI>; her false and sophisticate charms will bewitch all eyes, and debauch all hearts, and all will be willing to sell their country, if a pur|chaser can be found.</P>
<P>It is not <HI>yet,</HI> but it will <HI>soon</HI> be, too late to ward off this horrible ruin.</P>
<P>In the year 1754, when our profound govern|ment, always too busy in the wrong place, pro|posed to tax the colonies by act of parliament, and to direct the governors to concert measures for their defence against the <HI>French,</HI> instead of leaving both to the colonists themselves, this wise scheme was communicated by governor <HI>Shirley</HI> to a gen|tleman of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> then in <HI>Boston,</HI> who has very eminently distinguished himself, before and since that time, in the philosophical world, and whose judgment, penetration and candour, as well as his
<PB N="277" REF="013851_0808_0F9E283FE6B1DE58">
readiness and ability to suggest, or carry into exe|cution every scheme of public utility, have most deservedly endeared him, not only to his fellow-sub|jects over the whole <HI>American</HI> continent, but to mul|titudes on this side the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> and now suffers for that integrity which should have procured him reward. This sagacious gentleman (whose friendship the col|lector of these papers will ever account one of the most fortunate circumstances of his life) sent the governor a set of remarks, of which the following are the heads; and which do almost exhaust the subject.</P>
<P>That the people always bear the burden best, when they have, or think they have, some share in the direction.</P>
<P>That when public measures are generally distasteful to the people, the wheels of government must move more heavily.</P>
<P>That excluding the people of <HI>America</HI> from all share in the choice of a grand council for their own defence, and taxing them in parliament, where they have no representative, would probably give extreme dissatisfaction. [How soundly this extraordinary per|son judged of the sentiments of the colonists, let the history of the subsequent proceedings of our incorri|gible government in attempting, in spite of this wise premonition, to tax them in parliament, bear witness.]</P>
<P>That there was no reason to doubt the willingness of the colonists to contribute for their <HI>own</HI> defence.</P>
<P>That the people themselves, whose all was at stake, could better judge of the force necessary for their defence, and of the means for raising money for the purpose, than a <HI>British</HI> parliament at so great a dis|tance.</P>
<P>That natives of <HI>America</HI> would be as likely to con|sult wisely and faithfully for the safety of their native
<PB N="278" REF="013851_0809_0F9E28401BDCEF40">
country, as the governors sent from <HI>Britain,</HI> whose object is generally to make fortunes, and then return home, and who might therefore be expected to carry on the war against <HI>France</HI> rather in a way, by which themselves were likely to be gainers, than for the greatest advantage of the cause.</P>
<P>That compelling the colonies to pay money for their own defence, without their consent, would shew a suspicion of their loyalty, or of their regard for their country, or of their common sense, and would be treating them as conquered enemies, and not as free <HI>Britons,</HI> who hold it for their undoubted right not to be taxed but by their own consent, given through their representatives.</P>
<P>That parliamentary taxes, once laid on, are often continued after the necessity for laying them on, ceases; but that, if the colonists were trusted to tax themselves, they would remove the burden from the people, as soon as it should become unnecessary for them to bear it any longer.</P>
<P>That, if parliament is to tax the colonies, their assemblies of representatives may be dismissed as use|less.</P>
<P>That taxing the colonies in parliament for their own defence against the <HI>French,</HI> is not more just, than it would be to oblige the cinque ports, and other coasts of <HI>Britain,</HI> to maintain a force against <HI>France,</HI> and to tax them for this purpose, without allowing them representatives in parliament.</P>
<P>That the colonists have always been indirectly taxed by the mother country (besides paying the taxes necessarily laid on by their own assemblies) inasmuch as they are obliged to purchase the manufactures of <HI>Britain,</HI> charged with innumerable heavy taxes; some of which
<PB N="279" REF="013851_0810_0F9E2840DD0AD468">
manufactures they could make, and others could pur|chase cheaper at other markets.</P>
<P>That the colonists are besides taxed by the mother country, by being obliged to carry great part of their produce to <HI>Britain,</HI> and accept a lower price than they might have at other markets. The difference is a tax paid to <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>That the whole wealth of the colonists centres at last in the mother country, which enables her to pay her taxes.</P>
<P>That the colonists have, at the hazard of their lives and fortunes, extended the dominions, and increased the commerce and riches of the mother country, [so much that in <HI>Iosh Gee</HI>'s time, it was reckoned, that our colony trade was almost the only commerce, by which we were gainers] that therefore the colonists do not deserve to be deprived of the native right of <HI>Britons,</HI> the right of being taxed only by representa|tives chosen by themselves.</P>
<P>That an adequate representation in parliament would probably be acceptable to the colonists, and would best unite the views and interests of the whole empire.</P>
<P>A headstrong minister made afterwards so good use of these masterly observations, as to improve upon the stupidity of the blind pilots of 1754. For he almost set <HI>America</HI> in arms, by proposing to tax them in a time of peace, the money to be applied, not to their defence, but to the general purpose of all the <HI>British</HI> taxes, the support of a standing army, and gorging the rapacity of the state-bloodsuckers. He had the influ|ence afterwards to obtain a parliamentary confutation of the colonists doctrine, and a declaration, that
<Q>the king and parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad, have, and of right ought to have, full power and authority to

make laws and statutes of sufficient force to bind the colonies, and his majesty's subjects in them, in all cases whatsoever;</Q>
and consequently in the case of taxation without representation. This was literally <HI>Pope</HI>'s divine <HI>right</HI> of governing <HI>wrong.</HI> And the wor|thy gentleman above referred to, being asked in the house of commons, what he thought of the declaration, answered frankly, He thought it, and supposed that all <Q>the colonists would think it, arbitrary and unjust.</Q>
Some of their blundering doings our profound mini|sters were afterwards obliged to undo, to the diver|sion of three kingdoms, and the colonists.</P>
<P><HI>Grenville</HI> would have considered, had he been a man of conceptions large enough for a tradesman's clerk, that by confining our colonists to trade only with us, we make them pay our taxes, without directly laying upon them any <HI>internal</HI> tax. For, if half our manu|facturers are maintained by them, do they not pay the taxes, which we charge upon those manufacturers? Does not the <HI>consumer</HI> pay the whole charge of the article he consumes? But that short-sighted politician exclaimed, that our <HI>chargeable</HI> colonies ought not to expect immunity from those taxes, which come so heavy upon us, and of which charge a great part is occasioned by the defence of our colonies. Would <HI>Grenville</HI> then have approved of our getting rid of this chargeable appendage? I believe the <HI>French</HI> would have thanked him for a part of the incumbrance, and I believe his own countymen would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orn him to pieces, if he had proposed alienating any part of what all considerate persons know to be of inestimable ad|vantage to us, if we do not, by injustice and false policy, disappoint ourselves of the advantage.</P>
<P>The object which a commercial nation ought to have always in view, is the enlargement and establish|ment
<PB N="281" REF="013851_0812_0F9E284257892580">
of its commerce: nor is there any plan more promising for this purpose, than that of colonising. For colonists proceeding originally from a mother country, come into the world with a prejudice for that country, which will naturally lead them, in the con|duct of their commerce, to favour that country above all others; and this happy prejudice can only be di|minished, or eradicated, by ill usage on the part of the mother country. Nothing brooks constraint so little as commerce: nothing is more delicate, nothing more spontaneous. Whatever proceedings of the mother country therefore break in upon the freedom of com|merce, defeat the very intention of colonising, and overthrow it to the foundation. By this rule let the wisdom of our ministers in taxing the colonies be judged of, or rather the distress they are in for a lit|tle money, and a few posts and places for their crea|tures.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Our Colonies of great Advantage, and therefore deserv|ed better Treatment.</HEAD>
<P>GRENVILLE's party, in order to defend their own folly in opening a breach between the mother-country and the colonies, endeavoured to depreciate the value of the colonies to <HI>Britain,</HI> and to shew, that were we even to lose them, the damage would not be great. They pretended, that colonies are naturally prejudicial to the populousness of a mother-country. But they only exposed their own ignorance. <HI>Devenant,</HI> if they had ever read him, (and they must be deep politicians who never read that
<PB N="282" REF="013851_0813_0F9E284372390288">
capital author) would have saved them the trouble of falling into this absurdity.
<Q>It will peradventure (says that masterly writer) be a great security and encou|ragement to those industrious people</Q>
[the colonists] if a declaratory law were made, That <HI>Englishmen</HI> have right to all the laws of <HI>England,</HI> while they remain in countries subject to the dominion of this kingdom <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Daven.</HI> II 36.</NOTE>. The colonists, the noble discoveries and settlers of a new world, from whence, as from an endless source, wealth and plenty, and the means of power and grandeur unknown to former ages, have been pouring into <HI>Europe</HI> these three hundred years!' What encouragement, what security do they not de|serve to enjoy! With the design of setting up, and keeping up a standard, in favour of civil and religious liberty, did the heroic ancestors of the colonists fly from persecution in their native country; they crossed the vast <HI>Atlantic</HI>; they pierced those woods where no humanised foot from the creation had trod; they roused the deadly serpent in his hole, the savage beast in his den, and the brutal <HI>Indian</HI> in his thicket; they encountered all the danger and difficulties of forming those settlements which have made the <HI>British</HI> empire what it is.</P>
<P><Q>Generally speaking (says <HI>Devenant</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. II.10.</NOTE>) our colo|nies, while they have <HI>English</HI> blood in their veins, and have relations in <HI>England,</HI> and while they can get by trading with us, the stronger and greater they grow, the more this crown and kingdom will get by them; and nothing but such an arbitrary power a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> shall make them desperate, can bring them to rebel.</Q></P>
<P>Colonies do not naturally produce depopulation in the mother country; but rather the contrary. For
<PB N="283" REF="013851_0814_0F9E2843F0179988">
many individuals emigrating, cause cheapness for those, who stay behind. They marry, and carry on popu|lation. The mother country thus coming to swarm with people, they find themselves obliged to cultivate trade and manufactures, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Devenant</HI> accordingly shews<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">II.2.</NOTE>, that <HI>England</HI> is grown both more popolous and richer, since the improvement of the colonies, than before; that, particularly, from the restoration to the revolution, <HI>viz.</HI> 28 years, the number of inhabitants was increased 900,000. What indeed has increased the wealth and power of the na|tion so much beyond queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, but the colonies?</P>
<P>"We cannot but wonder, says that excellent author, at their policy who were the first promoters of that law in 1693, which puts a difficulty upon, and re|strains the sale of any plantation or parcel of land in <HI>America</HI> to foreigners; whereas indeed we should in|vite and encourage aliens to plant in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> whereby the crown gains subjects, and the nation gets wealth by the labour of others. This statute does peradventure want revising. And countries that take no care to encourage an accession of strangers, in a course of time will find plantations of pernicious consequence. It may be computed that there have gone from <HI>England</HI> to the <HI>West-Indies</HI> for many years by a medium about 1800 persons annually; but then there is reason to think, that for some time the perse|cutions abroad have brought over to us by a medium about 500 foreigners every year; and there are grounds to believe, that for these last 20 years the <HI>West-Indies</HI>
<PB N="284" REF="013851_0815_0F9E2844C5028050">
have sent us back annually about 300 persons of their offspring with this advantage, that the fathers went out poor, and the children came home rich. But if such measures should hereafter be taken as will hinder the accession of strangers, or discourage the planters from returning back; then these colonies would drain us every year of 1800 persons.</P>
<P>We shall shew, that the plantations are a spring of wealth to this nation; that they work for us; that their treasure centres all here; and that the laws have tied them fast enough to us; so that it must be through our own faul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and mismanagement, if they become independent of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Iosiah Child,</HI> thinks, the <HI>New-Englanders,</HI> in his times, consumed ten times the value, in <HI>English</HI> manu|factures, of what they sent to <HI>England.</HI> Yet he reckons <HI>New-England</HI> the least advantageous of all the colonies. He thinks, two thirds of all the <HI>English</HI> shipping was, in his time, employed in the <HI>American</HI> trade, meaning chiefly the continental colonies.</P>
<P><HI>Postlethwayte</HI> thinks half the <HI>English</HI> manufactures go to <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>At the time of the stamp-act, it was computed, that the <HI>Americans</HI> owed <HI>Britain</HI> four millions sterling: A proof of a prodigious commerce.</P>
<P>The king, <HI>A.

<P>From this view of our whole exports to our <HI>American</HI> colonies, it appears, that our trade to the islands 27 years ago, <HI>viz. A. D.</HI> 1744 amounted to 796,112<HI>l.</HI> and thirteen years ago, <HI>viz. A. D.</HI> 1758, to 877,571<HI>l.</HI>
<PB N="286" REF="013851_0817_0F9E284613714B80">
That in 1744 our whole exports to the continent of <HI>America</HI> amounted to 640,114<HI>l.</HI> but in 1758 to 1,832,948 <HI>l.</HI> So that in 14 years, <HI>viz.</HI> from 1744 to 1758, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sland trade has been neither much increased nor diminished; but that our trade to the continent was in the same period increased almost three-fold. And in the year 1758, we had not got possession of all <HI>North-America.</HI> For the peace, by which we have excluded the <HI>French</HI> from all that part of the continent, which is east of the <HI>Mississippi,</HI> and are become masters of a territory, whose extent baffles arithmetic, was made in 1703. Supposing our trade to the continent of <HI>America</HI> to increase at the same rate, which nothing was likely to hinder, but our enraging our colonists by <HI>Grenville</HI>'s mad and unjust project of taxing them, without representation, it is evident, that this alone would have been an inexhaustible, and endless fund of trade. For, if in the last of the above quoted years, <HI>viz.</HI> 1758, our trade was increased three-fold beyond what it was 14 years before, it was to be expected, that in another period of 14 years, <HI>viz.

<HI>America</HI> to any such effect as to supersede those of the mother-country. Because for many ages to come, it will be more advantageous for the working people to take land, settle, and marry, than to be journey|men manufacturers. Which likewise secures a pro|digious and still growing and accomulating increase of people. It is found, that, on the continent of <HI>America,</HI> the number of the people is at least doubled every twenty years. Therefore, if the number of <HI>British</HI> people on the continent of <HI>America</HI> be now two millions, (I put the lowest computation) twenty years hence it will be four millions. Let the reader only consider one moment, what sort of head that m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n must have had, who could think of risquing the loss of four millions of customers for the manufactures of his country&mdash;all for the sake&mdash;of making a few places for collectors, and commissioners of duties and taxes, that he might have somewhat to stop the <HI>Cerberian</HI> barking of a pack of hungry court-curs.

<P>I am aware, that, in diminution of the value of our colonies, the <HI>Grenville</HI> party have alledged, that the colonists, are very deeply indebted to us, and that they have ever shewn a backwardness to acquit them|selves of those just debts; so that our commerce with them is much less to be desired. But is it not no|torious, that for many ages together the mother-country had no shadow of complaint of this kind against the colonies; and that the first cause of the interruption of payments from <HI>America</HI> was our mi|nister's stopping the trade between our colonists and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in that part of the world.</P>
<P>Such have our colonies been to us, and such, and more than we can imagine, they would have been to us.</P>
<P>And now it is a favourite object with us, to enslave and destroy those whom we ought both from gratitude and prudence, to support and cherish.

<P>Our colonists have long complained, that we have needlessly hampered and restricted their trade; that, like awkward parents, we have exerted too much au|thority over our children; while the whole art of ma|naging them consisted in letting them alone.</P>
<P>The colonists complain, that the governors we send them are generally needy men, whom we send thither chiefly to fill their pockets; that both governors and judges depend more upon the <HI>British</HI> court than upon the people whom they are to govern and to judge; that our court gives authority to the commissioners of customs to appoint and pay, at the expence of the people, without their consent, as many officers as they please, to the multiplication of placemen, the plun|dering the people, and the danger of liberty; that the whole people of <HI>America</HI> are put to expence and trouble merely to put a little money in the pockets of a few <HI>Portugueze</HI> merchants in <HI>England.</HI> The colo|nists must not import directly from <HI>Portugal</HI> even a little oil or fruit, without having them loaded with the expences of a voyage three thousand miles round by <HI>England,</HI> which, in war time, increases every arti|cle 30 <HI>per cent.</HI> and imporishes the colonies. They

must not make a nail, a penknife, or a hat. We empty our jails on them, and fill their country with our rogues and thieves. We oblige their assemblies to provide quarters for our soldiers, and find them firing, bedding, candles, small beer, or rum, salt, vinegar, &amp;c. at the expence of the provinces, in a time of profound peace, though they have little occasion for a military force at any time, being themselves all trained to arms. The colonists were, however, so pleased at the removal of the stamp-act, that they agreed to the quartering of troops, hoping that it would be only a temporary grievance. But that they might not give place to authority where it was unconstitutional, they made acts of their own assemblies, leaving out some of the small articles, as salt and vinegar. Even this was found to be rebellion, and the province of <HI>New-York</HI> had its assembly annihilated for the offence.</P>
<P>The house of representatives of <HI>Massachuset's-Bay</HI> petitioned the king to remove Sir <HI>Fr. Bernard,</HI> their governor; because, amongst other things, he had misrepresented the colonists to the ministry in such a manner, that it was thought necessary to send a mili|tary force among them (Instead of sending them sol|diers, they should have removed grievances.) Those military men turned the assembly room into a barrack for the common soldiers, and planted the centinels in such a manner, that the councellors and justices of the courts were interrupted and challenged in passing on their business. They endeavoured to quarter their troops in the town of <HI>Boston,</HI> while the barracks were useless. He dissolved the assembly at the most improper time, and arbitrarily refused to call another, though often petitioned for ten months together.</P>
<P>The colonists complain of general warrants, under which any officer or servant of the customs may

break open any man's house, closet, chest, &amp;c. at pleasure; of our court's establishing the arbitrary and oppressive power of the excise laws in the customs; of appointing judges, during pleasure, to try all reve|nue causes without jury; of compelling his majesty's subjects in all revenue matters to take their trials in any of the colonies, however distant from their respective habitations, where their characters are known; of a secretary of state's sending a requisition to the assembly at <HI>Boston,</HI> with threats, tending to force their determinations, which ought to be free; of threatening and punishing the <HI>American</HI> assemblies for petitioning the king, though the act of settlement expressly secures this right to the subject; of misap|plying several <HI>American</HI> revenues; of impowering the crown to seize and send over to <HI>Britain,</HI> for trial, those of the colonists who become obnoxious to the court, without legal indictment, or bill found by jury; of suspending the legislative power of the province of <HI>New-York,</HI> so as to destroy that freedom of debate and determination which is the necessary, unalienable, and constitutional right of such assemblies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> complains heavily and repeatedly, that the election of the council at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New Eng|land,</HI> gives the people too much power<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See his LETT.

Suppose a people should chuse to keep all the power in their own hands, and delegate none?

<P>Dr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> in his examination before the house of commons, declared, that the causes of the <HI>British</HI> parliament's having lost, in great part, the respect of the colonists, were, the restraints lately laid on their trade, by which the bringing of gold and silver into the colonies was prevented, the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ibition of paper-money among themselves, and then demanding a new and heavy tax by stamps, taking away at the same time trial by juries, and refusing to receive and hear their humble petitions <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB.

<P>Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> having refused to call a legal assembly of representatives, as above hinted, the people of a great many towns sent to <HI>Boston</HI> commissioners to meet and treat of public affairs, and prevent anarchy and confusion; but disclaiming all authoritative or governmental designs or acts.

He afterwards sent them a message, that he could not suffer them to continue sitting, after the assembly of the province was, by authority, dissolved and forbid|den to sit; and that the committee of convention was, to all intents and purposes, an assembly under a dif|ferent name. He therefore warns them of the con|sequences.

The committee of convention afterwards remonstrated to the governor against lodging troops in the city, while there were barracks fit for receiv|ing them, and not full, as contrary to act of parlia|ment. The committee of convention afterwards pub|lished a manifesto, signifying, that the design of their meeting was to preserve the peace, and to petition the king in favour of the province, that a regular assembly might be called, and grievances redressed. The members of the council of the province of <HI>Mas|sachusets Bay</HI> addressed general <HI>Gage,</HI> commander of the forces sent to <HI>Boston,</HI> excusing their own conduct, and the disturbances in <HI>Boston,</HI> and begging that the military might be moved to the Barracks.</P>
<P>I believe they, who are so violent for loading our poor fellow subjects in <HI>America</HI> with taxes, would think themselves hardly used, if they were hampered in their manufactures and commerce by a people beyond the occean, in the same manner as the colo|nists are by us in many instances, severe, useless, and impolitic. Such are our restraining them from the use of slitting mills and steel furnaces; our prohibit|ing them the cutting of white pines; our regula|tions, which oblige them to bring to us all their pro|ducts, though they might find better markets else|where; which is obliging them to sell to us all their products at our own price; and those other regula|tions, by which they are prohibited manufacturing many necessary articles, or purchasing them of other nations, only that they may be obliged to have them of us at an advanced price; for we can afford no goods but at an advanced price, loaded as we are with 140 millions of debt, the interest of which, amounting to above 5 millions <HI>per annum,</HI> must be raised in great part out of the profits of our trade.
<PB N="296" REF="013851_0827_0F9E28509B7AA718">
Thus we make the poor colonists sell to us as cheap as we please, and purchase our goods as dear as we please. This alone is taxing them with a vengeance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carthaginians</HI> obliged the people of <HI>Sardinia (vae victis!)</HI> to buy corn of <HI>them</HI> exclusively, at the price they set upon it: but we do not hear that those tyrannical conquerors forced the enslaved <HI>Sardinians</HI> to sell them their products at a price of their own fixing; while we impose this law, not on the <HI>con|quered Welsh</HI> or <HI>Irish,</HI> or the once restless and rebel|lious <HI>Scotch</HI>; but on our colonists, our once tractable and obedient <HI>children,</HI> to whom we are under greater obligations than to <HI>Scotch, Irish,</HI> and <HI>Welch,</HI> all put together.</P>
<P>The colonists complain, that their trade is peculi|arly restricted by laws made in a parliament, in which they are not represented; that they are taxed in the same parliament; therefore have no opportunity of giving, or with-holding, their consent; which pro|duces a confusion of taxes, as their <HI>own assemblies</HI> are obliged to lay on taxes for defraying the necessary expences of their respective provinces, at the same time that the <HI>mother-country</HI> may be laying on other taxes so heavy, that both together may be beyond the abilities of the people. They complain of being obliged to find quarters, firing, bedding, candles, rum, &amp;c. for the <HI>army,</HI> though they are obliged to keep up a <HI>militia</HI> of their own. That their money <HI>raised</HI> without and contrary to their consent, is to be <HI>applied,</HI> likewise, without and contray to their appro|bation, <HI>viz.</HI> in paying the salaries of governors, judges, and other officers appointed by the court, and remov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able at its pleasure. They affirm, that several of their original charters are, by late laws, set aside; so that the settlers are deceived out of the
<PB N="297" REF="013851_0828_0F9E285152FBCD60">
privileges, on the faith of which they first left their native country, crossed the ocean, and established those colonies, which have been of so great value to the mother-country. They complain of having been restrained by the ministry from the privilege of peti|tioning against these oppressions, and having their assemblies annihilated for doing what the Bill of Rights allows to every <HI>Englishman</HI>; a stretch of power very much resembling that of <HI>Ch.</HI> II. in seizing the char|ter of the city of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The act of parliament, by which the stamp-act was repealed, asserted a power in king, lords, and com|mons to tax the colonies. But it seems, the secre|tary of state alone has power to dissolve, annihilate, and interdict their assemblies. Thus, if our proceed|ings against <HI>America</HI> are viewed on one side, the colo|nists are subject to <HI>king, lords,</HI> and <HI>commons</HI>; if, on the other, the <HI>secretary</HI> of <HI>state alone</HI> is their master.</P>
<P>Can it be with a favourable design to the colonies, that the ministry always recommend to the governors, who are generally their creatures, to obtain <HI>permanent</HI> salaries for the government-offices? Is there any bet|ter means for securing good behaviour in officers, than putting them upon the foot of <HI>quamdiu se bene gesse|rint?</HI> Stopping supplies our ancestors thought the only sure way to obtain redress of grievances. Give the <HI>American</HI> governors and other officers permanent sa|laries, so as they shall be independent on the people, and you give them the hint to erect themselves into petty despots and tyrants.</P>
<P>The colonists have long complained, that we need|lessly hamper their trade with the ports of <HI>Europe.</HI> Why may not, say they, the colonists be allowed to fetch and carry in their own ships, to and from the several ports of <HI>Europe,</HI> whatever articles do not inter|fere
<PB N="298" REF="013851_0829_0F9E2852207157F8">
with the trade of the mother-country? Are the people of <HI>Britain</HI> afraid, lest the colonists be too thriv|ing? They will only, in that case, be the better customers to the mother-country. For the more luxurious they grow, the more they will want of the <HI>British</HI> manufactures, unless we drive them to other shops by our ill usage, or exorbitant prices. Nothing requires more to be free and unconfined than com|merce.</P>
<P>The duty of 3 <HI>d. per</HI> gallon on melasses, they say, is more than the article will bear, and therefore ope|rates as a prohibition; stopping their exportation of horses, lumber, flour, and fish, to the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> colonies; and the vent for them in <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>West-Indies</HI> is not sufficient to take them off. The stopping the exportation of melasses into the continen|tal colonies, hinders their distilling, and is a prejudice to the rum-trade with <HI>Africa,</HI> and throws it into the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> and hurts the fishery. There used to be imported into <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> only 1,150,000 gallons of melasses annually; the duty upon which is 14,375 <HI>l.</HI> sterling, a larger sum than ever was in circulation at any one time in the colony. The money to be sent out, never to return. How is this drain to be kept running? If the colonies be, by our clumsy laws, disabled from purchasing <HI>British</HI> manu|factures, who will be the gainers? The restricting of the colonists from sending their products to better and more convenient markets, than <HI>Britain,</HI> is a loss to <HI>Britain</HI> of all the difference; for all the profits, the colonists get, have always come to <HI>Britain</HI>; and the more considerable their profits, the better for the mother-country.</P>
<P>The courts of vice-admiralty, they say, are a great grievance. A custom-house-officer may seize, for
<PB N="299" REF="013851_0830_0F9E2853214F1598">
what he calls probable cause, in <HI>Georgia,</HI> and carry the trial to <HI>Halifax,</HI> 1500 miles. The unfor|tunate owner of the seized goods must follow. When arrived there, out of the reach of his friends and acquaintance, he must give bond, else he cannot reclaim his goods. If the judge, perhaps with ini|quitous views, pronounces, that there was probable cause for seizing them, the unhappy man may be ruined, and all his comfort will be the same with that of the sick man, who dies, <HI>secundum artem,</HI> of the doctor, that he is undone according to act of parlia|ment. The patience of the colonists, for so many years, under such severe laws, deserved at our hands other treatment than we have lately regaled them with.</P>

<P>IT appears by Chap.

Would grant nothing, so much were they offended; though they assembled with the design of granting. So the people of <HI>Carolina</HI> lately, at the very time, when they were expressing great rage against the government's proposing to tax them with|out representation, voluntarily taxed themselves, to a considerable value, to make a present to a person in <HI>England,</HI> whose public conduct pleased them. The <HI>Roman</HI> senate, when <HI>Hannibal</HI> was at their gates, knowing that people will do more voluntarily, than by force, for carrying on the war, proposed, not a tax, but a benovolence.

It was an unjust tax that produced the terrible insur|rection under <HI>Wat Tyler</HI> and <HI>Iack Straw,</HI> which had almost ovorturned the state.

What effect the at|tempt to tax our own colonies may produce, remains to be seen&mdash;and felt. God forbid that it should equal the fears of wise and thoughtful men. To provoke three millions of people to their utmost rage, is no slight affair.</P>
<P>The two counties palatine of <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Durham,</HI> had (says <HI>Petyt,</HI> RIGHT OF THE COM. 45.) par|liaments of their own, before the conquest, and were not subject to any of the laws of the land, unless they agreed to them.</P>
<P>It was debated, <HI>A.

<P>Time was, when the city of <HI>Chester</HI> had no repre|sentation. The privilege of sending members was granted to that city, <Q>because (says the act 35 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. c. 13.
the inhabitants thereof have often been touched and grieved with acts and statutes made in parliament, as were deragatory unto the most antient jurisdiction, liberties, and privileges thereof, as preju|dicial unto the commonweal, quietness, and peace of his majesty's subjects.</Q></P>
<P>In the same manner representation was granted to the bishoprick of <HI>Durham</HI>; and it was not taxed 'till represented in parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="013851_0836_0F9E28599714D810">Mr. <HI>Molyneux</HI> (the gentleman, I suppose, with whom Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> corresponded) wrote a pamphlet, <HI>A.

In our times it is not. How much less our brave colonists, who never were conquered?</P>
<P><Q>In the reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> III. says <HI>Devenant,</HI> we find where parliaments have not been consulted, they have not thought themselves obliged to pay the ex|pence; for as we learn from <HI>Mathew Paris,</HI> king <HI>Hen.</HI> held a parliament at <HI>Winchester,</HI> where he de|sired an aid from his people, in regard his own trea|sure had been exhausted with paying his sister's por|tion to the Emperor, and by his own wedding. The parliament replied, That these things had been done without advising with them, and without their con|sent; and seeing they were free from the fault, they ought not to participate of the punishment. The <HI>Poictovins,</HI> to serve their own turn, had at another time engaged him in an useasonable war with <HI>France</HI>; upon which he called a parliament, and desired an aid. The barons told him, he had undertaken it un|advisedly; and that his parliament wondered, he would undertake so difficult and dangerous a business, with|out their advice and assent.</Q></P>
<P>In antient times, the lords have given the kings subsidies out of their own property. 13 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. the lords granted, for themselves, a tenth of all the corn growing upon their demesnes, the commons granting nothing at that time. At other times the knights of the shires, have granted separately from the other commoners; and at other times, the representa|tives of cities and boroughs have granted by them|selves.
<PB N="306" REF="013851_0837_0F9E285A5D376A78">
But still they granted only what was their own to grant. They did not grant the property of people at the distance of 3000 miles, who had not one re|presentative among them.</P>
<P><HI>Gee,</HI> in his excellent piece on trade, remonstrates against all measures, which tend to hamper our colo|nies. What would he have said, if he had been told, that the time would so soon come, when we should, with horror, see our administration eager to send an armed force to dragoon them into submission to unjust laws, by which their property was to be seized con|trary to their own consent, and those brave people by authority declared traitors, seditious, rebels, &amp;c. for defending their property?</P>
<P>It has been said on the subject of taxing the colonists in parliament; Why may not the colonists be <HI>taxed</HI> by the same assembly, which has an unquestioned power of making <HI>laws</HI> for them? But this is a confused and undistinguishing way of reasoning. It is hard|ship enough on the colonies to find their commerce hampered by laws, in the making of which they had no hand, nor could even remonstrate against them, while they were under consideration. But there may be pretexts for making laws, whose operations may eventually bring inconvenience upon the colonists; while no pretext can justify taxing them, so long as they continue unrepresented. Legislation and tax|ation, are very different things. The <HI>lords</HI> cannot alter a letter in a <HI>money</HI>-bill, though they may amend any other. And it is always to the <HI>commons</HI> the king has recourse for supplies, and to whom he returns thanks for them. The reason is plain. The lords have no power over the property of the people. The members of the house of commons are the represen|tatives of the commons of <HI>England</HI>; and as such have
<PB N="307" REF="013851_0838_0F9E285B4D926168">
a delegated power to grant supplies out of the property of the commons. the lords may at any time raise a sum of money for the crown out of their own pro|perty; but they cannot grant out of the property of the commons, because the commons have given them no such power, and because they sit in parliament upon their own account, and not as representatives.</P>
<P>The <HI>British</HI> house of commons proposing to tax the unrepresented colonies in <HI>America</HI> involves, there|fore, in my opinion, some striking absurdities. What is, for instance, to be the business of the provincial assemblies of representatives in <HI>America,</HI> if the power of taxing the colonies be in the <HI>British</HI> parliament at <HI>Westminster?</HI> Is it not obvious, that these two powers are incompatible? It is notorious, that by their charters several, if not all the provinces have the right of laying on taxes. And how then is the provincial assembly of <HI>New-England,</HI> for example, to lay on a tax of half a crown in the pound, at the same time that, for ought that is known in <HI>New-England,</HI> the house of commons in Old <HI>England</HI> may be voting a tax upon the people of that province of seventeen and sixpence in the pound? If we may put any trust in the first rule in arithmetic, here is the whole pound gone. Again: What could be more absurd than the commons giving and granting what was neither their own property, nor that of their constituents, what they had no more right to give and grant, (no man can give away a free subject's property, but himself or his representative) than they had to give and grant the property of the people of <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>France?</HI> Again: The king was, according to custom, to thank the commons for granting the <HI>American</HI> tax. But how was he to thank them? For sparing their own pockets, and taking out of those of the colonists against their
<PB N="308" REF="013851_0839_0F9E285BD24EA928">
consent? Or was he to thank the colonists, who were to pay the money? Certainly not. They were to pay it against their inclination.</P>
<P>The taxing of the unrepresented colonies is so un|just, that were it ever so prudent, it ought not to be done. It is so impolitic, that were it ever so just, it ought not to be thought of.</P>
<P><Q>If the king is to <HI>take</HI> at his pleasure, what have we to give?</Q>
was the common argument against <HI>Ch.</HI> Ist's raising money without consent of parliament; and may, with equal propriety, be used by our colonists against their being taxed by the <HI>British</HI> parliament, in which they have no representation.</P>
<P><HI>Edw.</HI> I. summoning one of his parliaments, uses these words, <HI>Ut quod omnes tangit ab omnibus probetur.</HI> He would have them consult about public affairs,
<Q>that what concerns all, may be approved by all.</Q>
A sound maxim surely. But would our taxing the colonists contrary to their approbation, be acting upon this principle?</P>
<P>Some short-sighted defenders of the late oppressive measures taken with our <HI>American</HI> brethren have at|tempted to wheedle them into a persuasion, that their being taxed by the <HI>British</HI> parliament, in which three millions have not one representative, is no greater hardship than what is suffered by the mother country, in which, though representation, as I have shewn in the former volume, is as far from adequate, as can well be imagined; yet six millions have 558 representatives, and in which every man, woman, and child, by living in one <HI>county</HI> or other, is represented by one or two members, who cannot tax them without taxing them|selves, their children, their friends, dependents, tenants, &amp;c. If the three millions of colonists had 279 representatives in parliament (the half of 558) it
<PB N="309" REF="013851_0840_0F9E285F26FFCB90">
might then be time to make comparisons between their case and that of the mother-country. Till then, or till they have some shadow of representation, nothing can be more absurd.</P>
<P>We have lately seen all <HI>England</HI> besetting the throne with complaints, that <HI>one county</HI> is deprived not of representation, but of <HI>one</HI> particular favourite indivi|dual, as one of their two representatives, while they may chuse any other individual upon the island in his place; and this not to <HI>perpetuity,</HI> but only during <HI>seven years</HI> at most; this we have lately seen, and we wonder, that <HI>three millions</HI> should complain, that they are to be taxed from age to age to whatever amount it may please the <HI>British</HI> parliament to impose on them, in which they have not the shadow of repre|sentative. Would they be the posterity of true <HI>Britons,</HI> if they did not complain of this?</P>

<P>At the time when the famous stamp-act of blessed memory was invented, the colonies were said to be in|debted

to <HI>Britain</HI> to the amount of no less than four millions, occasioned by their want of ability to make remittances, the consequence chiefly of our severe restraints on their commerce. The colonists are almost all farmers, wholly dependant on the produce of their lands, contented, and consequently happy; but in no condition to bear taxes, otherwise than by enabling us to pay our taxes out of the produce of their tobacco, rice, indigo, corn, lumber, wood, fish, furs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> How poor in cash must those countries be, where the sheriffs, in raising the annual taxes laid on by the assemblies, are often obliged to make returns into the treasury, of houshold goods taken in execution for want of cash; which goods cannot be sold for want of money to purchase them; where men of the best credit cannot raise cash to pay debts inconsiderable when compared with their estates; where creditors, when they sue to execution, obtain orders for sale of lands and goods, and though they offer those lands and goods for almost nothing, they are nothing the nearer being reimbursed, because there are no monied men to purchase after repeated advertisements of the sales. Thus the debtor is stripped, and the creditor not paid, and they break one another all round. And this very distress has been increased by those very ministers, whose taxation-schemes particularly required all mea|sures to be used, which were likely to promote a cir|culation of cash in the colonies. We have followed the example of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> task-masters, demanding money of the poor colonists at the same time that we put a stop to their trade with the <HI>Spanish</HI> colonies, the only means by which they could obtain wherewith to satisfy our demands.

<P>It was very fairly made out, that the colonists were not, generally speaking, in circumstances to pay the stamp-duty. And to raise the price of justice so high, that the people shall not be able to obtain it, is much the same as flatly denying them justice; while <HI>Magna Charta</HI> says, <HI>Nulli negabimus, nulli vendemus jus|titiam, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>By the <HI>Grenvillian</HI> politics, the <HI>American</HI> assemblies were not only to be stripped of the power of <HI>giving</HI> their own; but of <HI>defending</HI> their own. The stamp-duties were expressly declared to be for raising a revenue for making a more certain and adequate provision for the government of the colonies. As if the colonies had not common sense to consult for their own defence, and the administration of justice. Courts are always for over-governing. This was rendering the <HI>American</HI> assemblies useless. On this principle, any number of the creatures of a court might have been saddled upon the colonists, with salaries to any amount, and all on pretence of a certain and adequate provision for the support of government and administration of justice.

<PB N="313" REF="013851_0844_0F9E2861D9A114B8">
taxing themselves in their own parliament; while we tax the colonies in the <HI>British</HI> parliament, where they have not one representative.</P>
<P>Before the taxing of the unrepresented colonies was thought of, the ministry ought to have reduced exor|bitant salaries, abated, or abolished excessive per|quisites, annihilated useless places, stopped iniquitous pensions, with-held electioneering expences, and bribes for votes in the house, reduced an odious and devouring army, and taxed vice, luxury, gaming, and public diversions. This would have brought into the treasury ten times more than <HI>Grenville</HI> could ever ex|pect from taxing, by force and authority, the unre|presented colonies.</P>
<P>Even a conquered city has time given it to raise the contribution laid upon it; and may raise it in its own way. We have treated our colonies worse than con|quered countries. Neither <HI>Wales</HI> nor <HI>Ireland</HI> are tax|ed unheard and unrepresented in the <HI>British</HI> parlia|ment, as the colonies. <HI>Wales</HI> sends members to par|liament; and <HI>Ireland</HI> has done so. And as <HI>Ireland</HI> is not now represented in the <HI>British</HI> parliament, neither is it taxed in the <HI>British</HI> parliament.</P>
<P>It is frivolous to alledge, that because the mother-country has been at expences for the colonies, there|fore the <HI>British</HI> parliament may tax them without al|lowing them any legal opportunity of remonstrating against the oppression. The mother-country has spent her blood and her treasure in supporting, at different times, <HI>France</HI> against <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> against <HI>France, Prussia</HI> against <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Hungary</HI> against <HI>Prussia,</HI> and so on, without end. Does this give our parlia|ment a right to tax all <HI>Europe?</HI></P>
<P>What difference is there between the <HI>British</HI> par|liament's taxing <HI>America,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> court's lay|ing

<HI>England</HI> under contribution? The <HI>French</HI> court could but do this, if they had conquered <HI>England.</HI> Have we <HI>conquered</HI> our colonies?</P>

How will the necessary uniformity of the whole monarchy be preserved, if it be left to the discretion of a fifth part of the whole people, whether they will contribute any thing, and how much, to the general supplies?</P>
<P>The question was not, Whether the colonists should contribute to the public expence. The <HI>Gren|villians</HI> knew, that when requisition had been made by government, the colonists had answered their demands; particularly in the year 1756, 7, 8, 9, 1760, 61, and 62; they knew that the town of <HI>Bos|ton</HI> contributed for several years together twelve shil|lings in the pound. Our government, therefore, thought it but just to reimburse the colonies a part of their excessive expences.

<P>Where would have been the harm of making a fair and moderate proposal to the colonies? If they raised the money in obedience to our requisition, as for|merly, all was well. But surely it was soon enough
<PB N="315" REF="013851_0846_0F9E28635F88C100">
to propose levying money upon them by parliamentary taxation, when they refused to give upon requisition.</P>
<P>Instead of this, the court-language all ran in the imperative mood.
<Q>A spirit of faction in <HI>America</HI>&mdash;acts of violence, and resistance of the execution of the law&mdash;state of disobedience to all law and govern|ment&mdash;measures subversive of the constitution&mdash;a disposition to throw off all dependence on the mo|ther-country&mdash;steady perseverance necessary to in|force the laws&mdash;turbulent and seditious persons, who, under false pretences, have deluded numbers in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> and whose practices cannot fail, if suffered to prevail, to produce the most fatal consequences to the colonies immediately, and, in the end, to the whole <HI>British</HI> dominions.</Q>
Thus did our ministers put into the mouth of their amiable S&mdash;a language as re|mote from his disposition, as integrity is from theirs; setting him before his people in the character of an <HI>eastern despot,</HI> and not of the <HI>father</HI> of his subjects. See a certain speech.</P>
<P>Could not <HI>George Grenville</HI> have proposed, That the colonies should send over a certain number of agents who, by act of parliament, should have ses|sion and suffrage in our house of commons, during a certain period, in order to settle what sum the colo|nies should raise in proportion to the contribution raised by <HI>England</HI>&mdash;and to determine concerning the colo|nies sending, or not sending, members to subsequent parliaments? If it had been objected to this proposal, that the colonists sending over a set of temporary members to our parliament was a thing wholly unpre|cedented, he might have answered, that at the glorious revolution the corporation of <HI>London</HI> was introduced, and sat and voted in the house of commons; and the acts of the convention parliament were afterwards
<PB N="316" REF="013851_0847_0F9E2864355A6AB0">
established by a regular parliament composed in the usual manner, of king, lords, and commons. And as to the quota, or contingent, to be raised by the colo|nists, it might have been made to regulate, as that of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the contribution in <HI>England,</HI> in such a manner, that when the taxes raised in <HI>England</HI> amount to a certain sum, <HI>America</HI> shall contribute a thirtieth, fortieth, or fiftieth part of that sum. The colonists would naturally have sent over their ablest men and best patriots. They would have been pre|judiced in favour of what those men had agreed to; or those men would have satisfied our parliament, that it could answer no good end to lay taxes upon the colonies; as all their money centers at last in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and the more we raise upon them by way of tax, the less we can gain by them in the way of commerce. The colonies could not then have complained of tax|ation without representation, or of having their money taken from them by force. This would have been treating them as <HI>England</HI> did <HI>Scotland</HI> at the union; and surely no one will pretend that <HI>England</HI> is not un|der greater obligations to the colonies than to <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>In the time of <HI>Edw.</HI> III. a parliament was directed to meet at several different parts of the country at the same time, because the whole parliament could not assemble speedily enough at <HI>Westminster</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PARL.

I suppose the provincial meetings communicated their reso|lutions to that part of the parliament which met at the seat of government; and those resolutions which were made by the greatest number of the provincial meetings were to pass into laws.

<PB N="317" REF="013851_0848_0F9E2864D23E1EC8">
to the <HI>British</HI> parliament, would have regularly and constitutionally informed the latter, of the sense of the colonists upon every important point; which cannot now be done in any constitutional way; as the house of commons receives no petitions upon money bills, and the colonists have no members in the house. The reader sees that various ways might have been proposed for raising taxes upon the colonies, if it had been found proper to raise such taxes, none of which ways would so have irritated the colonists, or given them such an opportunity of exclaiming against the injustice and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">apacity of the mother-country.</P>
<P>On the contrary, such was the relentless fury of the ministry, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1768, against the colonists, that they proposed to address the king to fetch over any of them, who had shewn opposition to taxing without repre|sentation, to be <HI>tried in England,</HI> for that no jury in <HI>America</HI> would find them guilty, the people being all of one sentiment relating to that subject. This was fairly declaring, that they would rather see the con|stitution (which requires that the accused be tried by persons of the vicinage, supposed to know his charac|ter and behaviour) violated, than not see the <HI>Ame|ricans</HI> punished <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. VIII.43.</NOTE>. And if such a law should ever be enacted, and the spirit of contention should be kept up, we may suppose a disturbance to happen in every town of <HI>North America,</HI> and that it will be necessary to fetch over half the people of the plantations as witnesses, or as attestors to the character of the accu|sed persons. All the shipping that belongs to both mother-country and colonies, will be insufficient for bringing over and sending back the multitudes that will be wanted on such occasions. And how is this

expence to be borne? the freight and charges, I mean, of so many hundred thousands of witnesses, as will be summoned? And how is the business of the colonists to be carried on during their absence in <HI>Eng|land?</HI> How are the damages arising from their absence to be made up? How is the loss of many innocent lives to be made up? For many of these ships will of course be cast away, and many passengers will con|tract deadly diseases, by change of climate, &amp;c. The objections to this scheme are, in short, beyond reckoning, many of which will occur to every reader. An eminent member of the house of commons very lately declared in the house, that in his opinion, the whole proceedings of the ministry, with respect to the colonies, are <HI>Frenzy.</HI> But, to proceed,</P>
<P>The ministry, in the same year 1768, insisted on a declaration against the colonists founded upon a sup|posed illegal resolution of the assembly of <HI>Boston,</HI> which resolution they could not produce when called upon, and which governor <HI>Pownal</HI> assured the house had never been made in the ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbly of <HI>Boston,</HI> and that the supposition of its having been made, was owing to a mistake, and shewed how the mistake arose.
<Q>The chorus-men, who, at proper times, call for the question, helped them at this dead lift, by an incessant repetition of <HI>the question, the ques|tion</HI></Q>
[that is, in plain <HI>English,</HI> Let us vote, right or wrong, as the ministry would have us.]
<Q>At length, at 4 o'clock in the morning, the whole house in confusion, the resolutions and address were agreed to; upon which a member remark|ed, "That it was indecent to bring into the house resolutions ready cut and dry, only for the drudgery of passing them.

but most indecent to answer all arguments with <HI>The question, the question</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. VIII.47.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>If the colonists should object, that it will be very inconveni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt for them to send members from such a distance, it may be answered, that so it is for the northern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts of <HI>Scotland.</HI> All these matters of con|venience must be as chance orders them.

<P>Were parliaments shortened, were they restored to their efficiency, and set free from court-influence, the colonists might send as representatives any set of men possessed of property and common understanding. Members would then have no interest to pursue, but that of their country. They would of course be ho|nest, because they wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d have no temptation to the contrary. And an honest parliament would make all people in public stations honest.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>American</HI> colonists charters expressly secure to them the privilege of taxing themselves. It would be flagrant treachery for the mother-country to tax those colonies; for nothing, but absolute neces|sity, and the safety of the whole, (which would be ri|diculous to mention on this subject) could justify de|ceiving the posterity of those pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le, who trusted to the faith of the mother-country, and settled those colonies upon the express stipulatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of not being taxed by parliament. If the colonists charters give them the exclusive power of taxing themselves, the <HI>British</HI> parliament's taxing them, is destroying their charters. If the <HI>American</HI> charters may be destroyed, the charters of all the cities, and those by which all crown lands are held, may be annihilated.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="013851_0851_0F9E2868991CE8C8">The purport of all the colony-charters is, That all the emigrants, and their posterity, do enjoy for ever, all the privileges and liberties, which <HI>Enlishmen</HI> do in <HI>England.</HI> And they were to pay to the king, a fifth part of all the gold and silver ore found in <HI>America,</HI> and no other tax. Is it allowing them the privileges of <HI>Englishmen</HI> to tax them without giving them re|presentation? Is not every <HI>Englishman</HI> represented by his county members.</P>
<P>The <HI>British</HI> parliament cannot justly alter the char|ters of the colonies, without giving the colonists in|demnification for whatever th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y may suffer in conse|quence of such alteration. And how shall several millions of people be indemnified for being obliged to what they never expected, and, on the contrary, thought themselves, by their charters, secured against. I mean, being taxed by those, whose interest it is, in order to lighten their own shoulders, to lay a grievous burthen on theirs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Americans</HI> are already under the same grievance as the mother-country, viz. Of being unequally re|presented in their own assemblies, which yet have power to tax them. To subject them to be taxed by the <HI>British</HI> parliament, would be subjecting them to two taxing powers. This would be an additional grievance, unknown in <HI>Britain,</HI> which is subject only to one; it would be an additional grievance, even supposing <HI>America</HI> represented in parliament, in an adequate manner, as many parts of <HI>Britain</HI> are. But how would the injustice be doubled and trebled, if the <HI>Americans</HI> were taxed in the <HI>British</HI> parliament, in which they have no representation adequate, or inade|quate!

<Q>Whether or not there shall remain established by power against law and the constitu|tion, a military government in <HI>America,</HI> exclusive of the supreme civil magistrate.

He then puts the house in mind of the remonstrances he had formerly offered on the same subject.
<Q>I stated (says he) the powers of the charters, and those of the military commissions. I shewed them to be incompatible and illegal.</Q>
He then affirms, that the case was not fairly stated to the crown lawyers, who justified it, nor, consequently, were their opinions law. He therefore desired to have an opportunity of calling for the opinion of the attorney and solicitor general, in order to bring on in form the consideration of that great question; and that the further reading of the report be adjourned. Lord <HI>Barrington</HI> opposed all consideration; because the servants of the crown might come into censure. Governor <HI>Iohnstone</HI> pronounced the military commission illegal, impracticable, and self-contradictory. Governor <HI>Pownal</HI> said, <Q>I know, it is to no purpose to press a motion, which a majority can refuse.

them on that ground. And as I see in his place one of the learned gentlemen, who signed the opinion, [for the legality of the military commission]
if he will in his place rise up and defend the present esta|blishment and practice, I am ready for the argument.</Q>
The learned lawyer was afraid, to engage with the unlearned gentleman; and the ministry, as usual, pre|vailed.</P>

<P>It has been thought, that our misconduct with respect to our colonies has been the chief cause of the late unexampled confusions in credit. The colonists were accustomed to take from <HI>Britain,</HI> to the value of 500,000 <HI>l.</HI> annually in teas. Our wise taxation-schemes put them upon refusing our teas all admission into <HI>America.</HI> This prejudiced our <HI>East-India</HI> com|pany, and lowered the price of <HI>India</HI> stock; which occasioned many adventures in that stock, both in <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> to sail. Such mischief a rapaci|ous and blundering ministry can bring upon their country, in scrambling after a little money to gratify their creatures.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to justify all the steps that have been taken by the colonists. It is not easy for the most stoical individual to keep up his philosophy when pro|vocation runs high, much less for a mixed multitude of all sorts of people.

<P>The <HI>Bostonian</HI> proceeding, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1773, in destroy|ing the tea, on account of the duty laid upon it, must be given up as inexcusable; since all they had to do was to keep firm in their resolution, not to buy or drink any

of it <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">WHITEHALI EVENING, <HI>March</HI> 15, 1774.</NOTE>. But why did our government provoke the people of <HI>Boston,</HI> by sending them these cargoes of tea, loaded with an invidious duty?</P>
<P>Nothing is more peaceful by nature, than the ele|ment of water; yet we see to what a height the waves upon the ocean are raised by the winds, with what fury they dash the strong ships of several thousand tons burden, and beat them to pieces. Nothing is more innocent than the cattle, of which so many hundreds are driven into this great metropolis every week, 'till they be provoked. A boy of fifteen may drive a whole herd of them before him; but if a set of brutal butchers, with their sticks and dogs, set them|selves to enrage those placid animals, they immediate|ly change their nature, and become as furious as lions and tygers; they toss with their horns whatever comes in their way, and happy is he that can make his escape. So our colonists had originally the very dis|positions we could have wished; they had the most implicit respect for the mother country. Our prime minister's grey-goose-quill governed them, 'till that fatal hour in which the evil Genius of <HI>Britain</HI> whis|pered in the ear of <HI>George Grenville,</HI>

He ob|serves, that protection and obedience are reciprocal. That if <HI>Britain</HI> protects, <HI>America</HI> is obliged to obey [every just law; but not every unjust one.] He overlooks the great advantage <HI>Britain</HI> gains by <HI>America,</HI> by which she is enabled to protect herself, and her colonies, for her <HI>own sake.</HI> He raves against the co|lonists for shewing a little spirit in opposition to op|pression; but he takes no notice of their hardships in being taxed without representation, except that he mentions <HI>Chester</HI> and <HI>Durham</HI> as having been taxed before they were represented, and accordingly they demanded, and immediately obtained representation. See the preamble to 34 and 35 <HI>Hen.</HI> VIII. in which the complaint of the people of the county palatine of <HI>Chester</HI> of the disherison and damages suffered by them for want of representation in parliament, might, <HI>muta|tis mutandis,</HI> be exhibited by our <HI>American</HI> colonists.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pitt</HI> went on afterwards, and applauded the spirit with which the colonists had resisted tyranny. He affirms, that <HI>Britain</HI> gains 2,000,000 <HI>l.</HI> annually

by her colonies. That by means of this advantage, estates which 60 years ago were let for 2000<HI>l.</HI> a year, now yielded 3000<HI>l.</HI> and lands now sold for thirty years purchase instead of eighteen. That our profits by <HI>America</HI> carried us triumphantly through the late war.
<Q>And shall a miserable financier come with a boast, that he can fetch a pepper-corn into the ex|chequer to the loss of millions to the nation <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">LOND. MAG. 1766, p. 511.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>Suppose the taxing of the colonies shoul swell the treasury (which it will certainly not do, but the very contrary) we should then only have the colonists all. That we have now. Then we should have it with a grudge. Without taxing them, we always have had, and, for many ages, shall have, all the money they can raise. For they must have our manufactures. If we insist on taxing them, and irritate them in such a manner as to diminish our commerce with them, who will be the gainers? Such policy will neither suit ministry nor people.</P>
<P>I have been told by pretty good authority, that the neat produce of our judicious taxes on our colonies, by which we have lost (to mention only one article) the sale of teas to the amount of 500,000 <HI>l. per ann.</HI> amounted last year, <HI>viz.</HI> 1772, to the respectable sum of 85 <HI>l.</HI> sterling money. Such is the wisdom of our ministers!</P>
<P>Is this a time for us to lessen our public income? Do we not, as we manage matters, find difficulty enough in defraying the public expence with the largest public revenue we can raise? Have we been able to ease the nation of any part of the heavy load which lies upon our commerce? Have ten years of peace

extinguished any part, worth mentioning, of the pub|lic d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bt? Do not our ministers know, that a compa|rison between the present state of the <HI>French</HI> finances and ours is enough to make an <HI>Englishman</HI>'s blood run cold? If <HI>France</HI> should think of taking this oppor|tunity to make an attack upon us, are we in a con|dition to go to war with that formidable enemy; or does it shew our ministry to be endowed with com|mon sense, who can find no time but this to support the mis-named dignity of government, to compel the colonists to what they call a due submission to govern|ment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Will the vindication of the pretended honour of government, if it were to be vindicated by the proposed measures, make up for the diminution it will produce in our trade and revenues? Will the conquest of our colonies indemnify us for our being conquered by <HI>France?</HI></P>
<P>Supposing the effects of violent measures with the colonies to prove less fatal than the apprehensions of many, their lowest consequences must be a diminu|tion of our trade and revenues. This we are from ex|perience certain of; for we already feel it. But suppose those effects to prove such as may naturally be expected; how will it be with us, when we find the public revenue fall so short, that it will not stretch to pay the public creditors their whole dividends? What will a set of rash and hot-headed statesmen be able to advance for defending themselves against the rage of many thousands stripped of, perhaps, half their incomes.</P>
<P>The more violent of the anti-colonistical party seem to build their main hope of reducing the <HI>Americans</HI> to obedience on a <HI>military force.</HI> But it may be re|marked concerning this scheme, That it will either prove successful, or not: If the latter, then will the

impotence of our government appear more conspicuous to all <HI>Europe, Asia, Africa</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> and the advisers of the measure will be ashamed of it, and wish it had never been adopted. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> on the contrary, the colo|nists should find themselves obliged to yield so much against their inclination to this military force, not|withstanding the many advantages they have above what the mother-country can boast of for defeating a design upon their liberties&mdash;let the people of <HI>England</HI> consider with horror what a frightful hint this gives to the enemies of liberty for enslaving the mother-country. I am myself a friend to liberty, and there|fore will not explain more minutely. These are hopeful politics, whose consequences are too shocking for a good citizen to explain.</P>
<P>In short; The new method of taxing our colonists in parliament, where they have no repres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntation, <HI>adequate</HI> or <HI>inadequate,</HI> is subversive of liberty, an|nihilates property, is repugnant to the genius of the people, oppressive to their indigence; it strikes at the root of their charters, as colonists, and of their privi|leges as <HI>British</HI> subjects ever loyal and unoffending; it is deragotary from the faith of government, omnius to the liberty of the <HI>British</HI> empire, unjust in its prin|ciples, rigorous in its execution, and pernicious in its operation alike to the mother-country and the colo|nies. What public measure can the memory of man produce, deserving so many commendations? Whe|ther it is yet time to reverse such proceedings, or whether it will be better policy to pursue still farther the measures, which have hitherto appeared so ho|nourable, and proved so salutary, is humbly sub|mitted.</P>
<P>To crown what I have to say on the grievance which makes the subject of this IId Book, I will sub|join a copy of the spirited PROT&mdash;T of eleven worthy

noblemen, who have endeavoured to stop the torrent of ministerial fury against our abused colonies. I wish it were in my power worthily to celebrate the praises of those illustrious personages.

<HEAD>PROTEST against the bill,
<Q>for the better regulating the government of the <HI>Massachuset's Bay,</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></Q></HEAD>
<LETTER>
<P>DISSINTIENT,<LB>
"Because this bill, forming a principal part in a system of punishment and regulation, has been carried through the house without a due regard to those indis|pensable rules of public proceeding, without the obser|vance of which, no regulation can be prudently made, and no punishment justly inflicted. Before it can be pretended that those rights of the colony of <HI>Massachu|set's Bay,</HI> in the election of counsellors, magistrates,
<PB N="330" REF="013851_0861_0F9E287254213E78">
and judges, and in the return of jurors, which they derive from their charter, could with propriety be taken away, the definite legal offence, by which a forfeiture of that charter is incurred, ought to have been clearly stated and fully proved; notice of this adverse proceeding ought to have been given to the parties affected; and they ought to have been heard in their own defence. Such a principle of proceeding would have been inviolably observed in the courts below. It is not technical formality, but substantial justice. When therefore the <HI>magnitude</HI> of such a cause transfers it from the cognizance of the inferior courts of the high judicature of parliament, the lords are so far from being authorized to reject this equita|ble principle, that we are bound to an extraordinary and religious strictness in the observance of it. The subject ought to be indemnified by a more liberal and beneficial justice in parliament, for what he must ine|vitably suffer by being deprived of many of the <HI>forms</HI> which are wisely established in the courts of ordinary resort for his protection against the dangerous promp|titude of arbitrary discretion.</P>
<P N="2">"2dly, Because the <HI>necessity</HI> alledged for this preci|pitate mode of judicial proceeding cannot exist. If the numerous land and marine forces, which are or|dered to assemble in <HI>Massachuset's Bay,</HI> are not suffi|cient to keep that single colony in any tolerable state of order, until the cause of its charter can be fairly and equally tried, no regulation in this bill, or in any of those hitherto brought into the house, are suffici|ent for that purpose; and we conceive, that the mere celerity of a decision against the charter of that pro|vince, will not reconcile the minds of the people to that mode of government which is to be established upon its ruins.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="331" REF="013851_0862_0F9E287335F53F68">"3dly, Because Lords are not in a situtation to de|termine how far the regulations, of which this bill is composed, agree, or disagree, with those parts of the constitution of the colony that are not altered, with the circumstances of the people, and with the whole detail of their municipal institutions. Neither the charter of the colony, nor any account whatsoever of its courts and judicial proceedings, their mode, or the exercise of their present powers, have been produced to the house. The slightest evidence concerning any one of the many inconveniencies stated in the preamble of the bill to have arisen from the present constitution of the colony judicatures, has not been produced, or even attempted. On the same general allegations of a declamatory preamble, any other right, or all the rights of this or any other public body, may be taken away, and any visionary scheme of government sub|stituted in their place.</P>
<P N="4">"4thly, Because we think, that the appointment of all the members of the council, which by this bill is vested in the crown, is not a proper provision for preserving the equilibrium of the colony constitution. The power given to the crown of occasionally in|creasing or lessening the number of the council on the report of the governors, and at the pleasure of mini|sters, must make these governors and ministers masters of every question in that assembly; and by destroying its freedom of deliberation, will wholly annihilate its use. The intention avowed in this bill, of bring|ing the council to the platform of other colonies, is not likely to answer its own end; as the colonies, where the council is named by the crown, are not at all better disposed to a submission to the practice of taxing for supply without their consent, than this of <HI>Massachuset's Bay.</HI> And no pretence of bringing it
<PB N="332" REF="013851_0863_0F9E2873D228CDC0">
to the model of the <HI>English</HI> constitution can be sup|ported, as none of those <HI>American</HI> councils have the least resemblance to the house of peers. So that this new scheme of a council stands upon no sort of foun|dation, which the proposers of it think proper to acknowledge.</P>
<P N="5">"5thly, Because the new constitution of judica|ture provided by this bill is improper, and incongru|ous with the plan of the administration of justice in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> All the judges are to be henchforth nominated (not by the crown, but) by the governor; and all (except the judges of the superior court) are to be removable at his pleasure, and expressly <HI>without</HI> the consent of that very council which has been no|minated by the crown.</P>
<P>"The appointment of the sheriff is by the will of the governor only, and without requiring in the person appointed any local or other qualification. That sheriff, a magistrate of great importance to the whole administration and execution of all justice, civil and criminal, and who in <HI>England</HI> is not removeable even by the royal authority, during the continuance of the term of his office, is by this bill made change|able by the governor and council, as often, and for such purposes, as they shall think expedient.</P>
<P>"The governor and council thus intrusted with powers, with which the <HI>British</HI> constitution has not trusted his majesty and his privy-council, have the means of returning such a jury in each particular cause, as may best suit with the gratification of their passions and interests. The lives, liberties, and pro|perties of the subject are put into their hands without controul; and the invaluable right of trial by jury is turned into a snare for the people, who have hitherto
<PB N="333" REF="013851_0864_0F9E287724EDC028">
looked upon it as their main security against the licen|tiousness of power.</P>
<P N="6">"6thly, Because we see in this bill the same scheme of strengthening the authority of the officers and mi|nisters of state, <HI>at the expence of the rights and liberties of the subject,</HI> which was indicated by the inauspicious act for shutting up the harbour of <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>"By that act, which is immediately connected with this bill, the example was set of a large impor|tant city (containing vast multitudes of people, many of whom must be innocent, and all of whom are un|heard), by an arbitrary sentence, deprived of the ad|vantage of that port, upon which all their means of livelihood did immediately depend.</P>
<P>"This proscription is not made determinable on the payment of a fine for an offence, or a compensa|tion for an injury; but it is to continue until the ministers of the crown shall think fit to advise the king in council to revoke it.</P>
<P>"The legal condition of the subject (standing un|tainted by conviction for treason or felony) ought never to depend upon the arbitrary will of any person whatsoever.</P>
<P>"This act, unexampled on the records of parlia|ment, has been entered on the journals of this house as voted <HI>nemine dissentiente,</HI> and has been stated in the debate of this day, to have been sent to the colonies, as passed without a division in either house, and there|fore as conveying the uncontroverted universal sense of the nation.</P>
<P>"The despair of making effectual opposition to an <HI>unjust</HI> measure, has been construed into an approba|tion of it.</P>
<P>"An unfair advantage has been taken on the final question for passing that penal bill, of the absence of
<PB N="334" REF="013851_0865_0F9E2878511CA938">
those ords who had debated it for several hours, and strongly dissented from it on the second reading; that period on which it is most usual to debate the princi|ple of a bill.</P>
<P>"If this proceeding were to pass without animad|version, lords might think themselves obliged to reite|rate their debates at every stage of every bill which they oppose, and to make a formal division whenever they debate.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, Because this bill, and the other proceedings that accompany it, are intended for the support of that unadvised scheme of taxing the colonies, in a manner new, and unsuitable to their situation and constitutional circumstances.</P>
<P>"Parliament has asserted the authority of the legis|lature of this kingdom, supreme and unlimited over all the members of the <HI>British</HI> empire.</P>
<P>"But the legal extent of this authority furnishes no argument in favour of an unwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rantable use of it.</P>
<P>"The sense of the nation on the repeal of the stamp-act was,
<Q>that in equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty and sound policy, the taxation of the colonies for the ordinary purposes of supply, ought to be forborn;</Q>
and that this kingdom ought to satisfy itself with the advantages to be deprived from a flourishing and increasing trade, and with the free grants of the <HI>American</HI> assemblies; as being far more beneficial, far more easily obtained, less oppr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssive and more likely to be lasting than any revenue to be ac|quired by parliamentary taxes, accompanied by a total alienation of the affections of those who were to pay them. This principle of repeal was nothing more than a return to the ancient standing policy of this empire. The unhappy departure from it, has led to that course of shifting and contradictory measures,
<PB N="335" REF="013851_0866_0F9E28785B965CD8">
which have since given rise to such continued dis|tractions; by which unadvised plan, new duties have been imposed in the very year after the former had been repealed; these new duties afterwards in part re|pealed, and in part continued, in contradiction to the principles upon which those repealed were given up; all which, with many weak, injudicious, and precipitate steps taken to enforce a compliance, have kept up that jealousy which, on the repeal of the stamp-act, was subsiding; revived dangerous questi|ons, and gradually estranged the effections of the co|lonies from the mother-country, without any object of advantage to either. If the force proposed should have its full effect, that effect, we greatly apprehend, may not continue longer than whilst the sword is held up. To render the colonies permanently advan|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">geous, they must be satisffed with their condition. That satisfaction we see no chance of restoring, what|ever measures may be pursued, except by recurring, in the whole, to the wise and salutary principles on which the stamp-act was repealed.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Petition from the <HI>American</HI> gentlemen, who happened to be resident in <HI>London,</HI> to the two houses.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The humble</HI> PETITION <HI>of several Natives of</HI> America, She<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth,</P>
<P>"That your petitioners are constrained to com|plain to this right honourable house of two bills, which, if carried into execution, will be fatal to the rights, liberties, and peace of all <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>"Your petitioners have already seen, with equal astonishment and grief, proceedings adopted against them, which, in violation of the first principles of justice, and of the laws of the land, inflict the severest punishments without hearing the accused.</P>
<P>"Upon the same principle of injustice, a bill is now brought in, which, under the profession of bet|ter regulating the government of the <HI>Massachuset's Bay,</HI> is calculated to deprive a whole province, with|out any form of trial, of its chartered rights, solemnly secured to it by mutual compact between the crown and the people.</P>
<P>"Your petitioners are well informed, that a char|ter so granted was never before altered or resumed, but upon a fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l and fair hearing; that, therefore, the present proceeding is totally unconstitutional, and sets an example which renders every charter in <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>America</HI> utterly insecure.</P>
<P>"The appointment and removal of the judges at the pleasure of the governor, with salaries payable by the crown, puts the property, liberty and life of the subject, depending upon judicial integrity, in his power.</P>
<P>"Your petitioners perceive a system of judicial tyranny deliberately at this day imposed upon them,
<PB N="337" REF="013851_0868_0F9E2879D2758E30">
which, from the bitter experience of its intolerable injuries, has been abolished in this country.</P>
<P>"Of the same unexampled and alarming nature is the bill, which, under the title of a more im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">artial administration of justice in the province of <HI>Massachu|set's Bay,</HI> empowers the governor to withdraw offen|ders from justice; holding out to the soldiery an ex|emption from legal pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">secution for murder; and in effect subjecting that colony to military execution. Your petitioners intreat this right honourable house to consider what must be the consequence of sending troops, not really under the controul of the civil pow|er, and unamenable to the law, where the crime is committed among a people whom they have been industriously taught, by the incendiary arts of wicked men, to regard as deserving every species of insult and abuse. The insults and injuries of a lawle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l|diery are such as no free people can l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng endure; and your petitioners apprehend, in the consequences of this bill, the horrid outrages of military oppression followed by the desolation of civil commotions.</P>
<P>"The dispensing power, which this bill intends to give to the governor, advanced as he is already above the law, and not liable to any impeachment from the people he may oppress; must constitute him an abso|lute tyrant.</P>
<P>"Your petitioners would be utterly unworthy of the <HI>English</HI> ancestry, which is their claim and pride, if they did not feel a virtuous indignation at the re|proach of disaffection and rebellion, with which their countrymen have been cruelly aspersed. They can with confidence say no imputation was ever less de|served. They appeal to the experience of a century, in which the glory, the honour, the prosperity of <HI>England,</HI> have been, in their estimation, their own;
<PB N="338" REF="013851_0869_0F9E287A92768060">
in which they have not only borne the burthen of provincial wars, but have shared with this country in the danger and expence of every national war. Their zeal for the service of the crown, and the de|fence of the general empire, has prompted them, whenever it was required, to vote supplies of men and money to the utmost exertion of their abilities. The journals of parliament will bear witness to their extra|ordin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry zeal and services during the last war; and that but a very short time before it was resolved here to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke from them the right of giving and granting their own money.</P>
<P>"If disturbances have happened in the colonies, they intreat this right honourable house to consider the causes which have produced them among a people hi|therto remarkable for their loyalty to the crown, and affection for this kingdom. No history can shew, nor will human nature admit of an instance of general dis|content, but from a general sense of oppression.</P>
<P>"Your petitioners conceived, that when they had acquired property under all the restraints this country thought necessary to impose upon their commerce, trade and manufactures, that property was sacred and secure. They felt a very material difference between being restrained in the acquisition of property, and holding it when acquired under those restraints at the disposal of others. They understand subordination in the one, and slavery in the other.</P>
<P>"Your petitioners wish they could possibly perceive any difference between the most abject slavery, and such entire subjection to a legislature, in the constitution of which they have not a single voice, nor the least influence, and in which no one is present on their behalf. They regard the giving their property, by their own consent alone, as the unalienable right of the
<PB N="339" REF="013851_0870_0F9E287CD89486B8">
subject, and the last sacred bulwark of constitutional liberty. If they are wrong in this, they have been misled by the love of liberty, which is their dearest birth-right; by the most solemn statutes, and the resolves of this honourable house itself, declaratory of the inherent right of the subject; by the authority of all great constitutional writers, and by the unin|terrupted practice of <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> who have ever voted their own supplies to the crown&mdash;all which combine to prove, that the property of an <HI>English</HI> subject, being a freeman, or a freeholder, cannot be taken from him but by his own consent. To deprive the colonists, therefore, of this right, is to reduce them to a state of villenage, leaving them nothing they can call their own, nor capable of any acquisition but for the benefit of others.</P>
<P>"It is with infinite and inexpressible concern that your petitioners see in these bills, and in the principles of them, a direct tendency to reduce their country|men to the dreadful alternative of being totally en|slaved, or compelled into a contest the most shocking and unnatural with a parent state, which has ever been the object of their veneration and their love. They intreat this right honourable house to consider that the restraints, which examples of such severity and injustice impose, are ever attended with a most dangerous hatred.</P>
<P>"In a distress of mind, which cannot be described, your petitioners conjure this right honourable house not to convert that zeal and affection, which have hitherto united every <HI>American</HI> hand and heart in the interests of <HI>England,</HI> into passions the most painful and pernicious. Most earnestly they beseech this right honourable house not to attempt reducing them to a state of slavery, which the <HI>English</HI> principles of liberty,
<PB N="340" REF="013851_0871_0F9E287E715A9520">
they inherit from their mother country, will render worse than death&mdash;they, therefore, pray that this right honourable house will not by passing these bills overwhelm them with affliction, and reduce their countrymen to the most abject state of misery and humiliation, or drive them to the last resources of despair:</P>

<P>Yet such is the turn of mind of those who are at the head of the world, that they bestow more atten|tion upon the art of war, that is, the art of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ying their fellow-creatures, than upon the improvement of all the liberal arts and sciences, and outvie one ano|ther in keeping up bands of those butchers of mankind commonly called standing armies, to the number of many thousands; and so prevalent in this infatuation, that even we, though surrounded by the ocean, must mimick the kingdoms on the continent, and beggar ourselves by keeping up an army of near 50,000 in times of profound peace.</P>
<P>The whole art of war from beginning to end is, at best, but a scene of folly and absurdity. Two kings, already possessed of more territory than they know how to govern, fall out about a province. They immediately take up arms. Immediately half a continent is deluged in blood. They carry on their infernal hatred, while either of them can find in the purses of their beggared subjects any money to squan|der, or while they can find any more of their miser|able people, who, being by the fell ravage of war stripped of all, are glad to throw themselves into the army, to get a morsel of bread. And when the two mighty belligerant powers, the two venomous worms, have carried on the contest almost to the de|struction of both, the point in dispute remains unde|cided as before, or they see, that it might have been
<PB N="343" REF="013851_0874_0F9E28809BEBB868">
infinitely better decided by arbitration of indifferent states, without the spilling of one drop of christian blood.</P>
<P>War is not a more proper method of deciding con|troversies between kings, than single combat between individuals. All that can be determined by fighting is, that the conqueror is the best fighter of the two; not that he has justice on his side. As I should con|clude that private person, who chose rather to decide a quarrel by a duel, than to appeal to the laws of his country, or stand to arbitration of a few friends, a ruffian and a murderer; so I do not hesitate to pro|nounce every king a butcher of mankind who chuses rather to appeal to the <HI>ratio ultima regum,</HI> than to arbitration of neutral princes.</P>
<P>Standing armies first became necessary, or the pre|tence of their necessity plausible, when the disbanded troops, called <HI>tard-venus,</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> took to plunder|ing and mischief in times of peace. Then the neigh|bouring princes pretended they must be upon an equal foot with <HI>France.</HI> But what is that to <HI>England,</HI> sur|rounded by the sea, and guarded by a fleet equal to all the maritime force of <HI>Europe?</HI></P>
<P>In former times we had no mercenary army. It was the militia that went to the holy war, that con|quered <HI>France,</HI> &amp;c. So at <HI>Rome</HI> there was no mer|cenary army in the best times of the republic.

<P>An army, in a free country, says judge <HI>Black|stone</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">COMM. I.413.</NOTE>,
<Q>ought only to be inlisted for a short and limited time. The soldiers should live intermixed with the people. No separate camp, no barracks, no inland fortresses should be allowed.</Q>
Yet it is notorious, that our soldiers are inlisted for life, on pain of death, if they desert; and that camps, bar|racks, and inland forts, are very common in our pre|tended free country. The mere slavery of a soldier's life, and the rigorous discipline, and <HI>Turkish</HI> severities, so great a number of brave, and freeborn <HI>English</HI> sub|jects are exposed to in the army, are sufficient to render it the abhorrence of every true <HI>English</HI> spirit, and the peculiar disgrace of our country, and our times. See <HI>Blackstone</HI>'s COMMENTARIES, I.415, where the learned author (no malecontent) shews the peculiar danger to liberty from enslaving so many subjects, (and thereby exciting their envy against their coun|trymen, who enjoy what they are forever deprived of) and then arming those slaves, to enable them to re|duce the rest to their condition, of which ill policy history furnishes many terrible examples.</P>
<P><Q>In a land of liberty it is extremely <HI>dangerous</HI> to make a distinct order of the profession of arms. In absolute monarchies, this is necessary for the safety of the prince, and arises from the main principle of their constitution, which is, that of governing by fear: but in free states, the profession of a soldier, taken singly and merely as a profession, is justly an object of jealousy.&mdash;The laws, therefore, and con|stitution of these kingdoms know no such state as
<PB N="345" REF="013851_0876_0F9E288239299350">
that of a perpetual standing soldier, bred up to no other profession, than that of war <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blackst.</HI> COMM. I.407.</NOTE>.</Q>
Yet we see gen|tlemen breed up their sons for the army as regularly as for law, physic, or divinity; and, while in <HI>France,</HI> the land of slaves, the soldiery are engaged only for a certain time, ours are for life; that they may be ef|fectually separated from the people, and attached to another interest.</P>
<P>The judge goes on to shew, that in the <HI>Saxon</HI> times, the military force was under the absolute command of the dukes, or heretochs, who were elected by the people. This the judge, as if he were fascinated in favour of prerogative, sees in a dangerous light. This large share of power, says he, thus conferred by the people, though intended to preserve the liberty of the subject, was perhaps unreasonably detrimental to the prerogative of the crown.' And then he mentions one instance of its being abused. But will any <HI>En|glishman,</HI> understanding what he says, gravely declare, that he thinks an armed force safer, in respect of li|berty, in the hands of a <HI>king,</HI> than of a number of sub|jects elected by the <HI>people?</HI> Yet this very author pre|fers a militia to an army. If all this be either con|sistent with the fundamental principles of liberty, or with itself, it is to be understood in some manner, which I own to be out of my reach.</P>
<P><Q>Those, who have the command of the arms in a country, says <HI>Aristotle</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">POLIT. VII.9.</NOTE>, are masters of the state, and have it in their power to make what revolutions they please.</Q></P>
<P>The soldiery are themselves bound for life, under the most abject slavery. For what is more perfect slavery,
<PB N="346" REF="013851_0877_0F9E28843B0DB8B8">
than for a man to be, without relief, obliged to obey the command of another, at the hazard of his life, if he obeys, and under the penalty of certain death if he disobeys, while the smallest misbehaviour may bring upon him the most painful and disgraceful punish|ment?

<P>In the mutiny-act, it is always mentioned, that keeping up an army in time of peace, without con|sent of parliament, is unlawful. But there is no such clause for keeping up <HI>marines.</HI> Yet marines are as much an army as any other men; are mostly at land; and may, at any time, be applied to the enslaving of the people, as readily as the soldiery. 'Tis true, their number is at present inconsiderable; but that is entire|ly at the disposal of government.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Hinton</HI>'s arguments against a reduction of the army, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1738.</P>
<P N="1"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. The army is only a change made in the manage|ment of the armed force of the nation, which was formerly kept up in the guise of a militia.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The army is the very creature of the court; and therefore likely to execute every order of the court. The army is detached from the people for life, and enslaved for life. A militia continues still a part of the people, and is to return and mix with the people again, which must keep up in their minds both an awe and an affection for the people.</P>
<P N="2">2. N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w all the countries about have regular disci|plined armies.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> This is no reason for our keeping up an army, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> separated from all our neighbours. It is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> keeping up a fleet, and a militia.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="347" REF="013851_0878_0F9E2885DE360240">3. Our militia cannot be trusted. Our people are otherwise employed, than in learning military disci|pline.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The army are, on no account, preferable to a mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itia, but there being more thoroughly trained. Let the militia then be thoroughly disciplined. Fifty days exercise at different times in the year, will train them thoroughly. Let them have pay for those days, and carry on their business the rest of the year as at present. And let every male be trained; and then see, whether enemies will invade, or tumults disturb.</P>
<P N="4">4. The army has not yet enslaved us. Experience shews us, that a standing army is not unfriendly to liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> We ought to depend on the <HI>constitution</HI> for the safety of our liberties; not on the moderation of the individuals, who command our army. If our army has not yet enslaved us; we know, that the far greatest part of the world has been enslaved by armies. But it is much to be questioned, whether we are not already so far enslaved, that the people could not now obtain of government what they requested, though the undoubted sense of the people was known to go|vernment.</P>
<P N="5">5. An annual army is different from a standing ar|my. The former may be dissolved, whenever it pleases parliament to give over providing for it.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> There is no difference, as to the liberty of the subject, whether the army be on one foot, or the other; whether it be established by law, or whether it be constantly kept, and certainly never to be re|duced.</P>
<P N="6">6. An army is necessary to keep the peace. Tur|bulent people raise tumults about matters, which
<PB N="348" REF="013851_0879_0F9E288729281A30">
have had even the sanction of parliament, as excises, turnpikes, suppression of gin, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Good government is a surer way to keep the peace, than keeping up a formidable and expensive army. The people may judge wrong, or be misled occasionally. But it is mal-administration that sets up popular demagogues, who could not excite the people to tumults, if government did not afford some cause for discontent. The sanction of parliament neither will nor ought to satisfy the people, unless the people be satisfied of the independency of the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, who compose it. So much for lord <HI>Hin|ton</HI>'s arguments.</P>
<P><Q>Whatever it may be called, that government is certainly, and necessarily, a military government where the army is the strongest power in the coun|try. And it is eternally true, that a free parliament and a standing army are absolutely incompatible <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">CATO'S LETT. III.285.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is the interest of favourites to advise the king to govern by an <HI>army:</HI> for if he prevails (over his subjects) then they are sure to have what heart can wish; and if he fail, yet they are but where they were; they had nothing, and they can lose no|thing<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P><Q>All armies whatsoever, says <HI>Davenant,</HI> if they are over large, tend to the dispeopling of a country, of which our neighbour nation is a sufficient proof; where in one of the best climates in <HI>Europe</HI> men are wanting to till the ground. For children do not

<P>When a country is to be enslaved, the army is the instrument to be used. No nation ever was enslaved but by an army. No nation ever kept up an army in times of peace, which did not lose its liberties.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">ESS. II.370.</NOTE>. calls the army a mortal distemper in the <HI>British</HI> government, of which it must at last inevitably perish.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Walpole</HI>'s custom, if a borough did not elect his man for their member, to send them a mes|senger of <HI>Satan</HI> to buffet them, a company of soldiers to live upon them.</P>

<P>There is much stress laid, by those, who would lull us asleep, that we may not see our danger from the army, on the behaviour of that of <HI>Iames</HI> II. who, on being put to the trial on <HI>Hounslow heath,</HI> whether they would stand by the tyrant, all laid down their arms.

a pretty specimen. Does it follow, that because a protestant army would not be the instruments of a tyrant in overthrowing the religion they were brought up in (even the soldiers had some zeal for reli|gion in those days, though not a zeal according to knowledge) and establishing one they were from their infancy taught to dread above all earthly evils&mdash;does it follow, I say, that because an army would not do what must be so disagreeable to themselves, they would not do what may be supposed agreeable to themselves, that is, would not promote the esta|blishing of a military government? All history con|futes this reasoning. For all history shews, that the soldiery have ever been ready to enslave their fellow-subject<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; and almost all nations have actually been enslaved by armies.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Clifford</HI>'s scheme for making <HI>Charles</HI> II. abso|lute, was liberty of conscience; security of property; upright judges, to keep the people in good-humour; the fort of <HI>Tilbury</HI> to be made sufficient to bridle the city. <HI>Plymouth,</HI> in the west; <HI>Hull,</HI> in the north, made tenable.

<P>When a country is so circumstanced, that fruga|lity is peculiarly necessary, a standing army is pecu|liarly improper. The annual charge of keeping up from 30 to 50,000 men is not small. And I think it impossible to shew any occasion we have for 5000 men, if we were so wise as to keep the militia upon a proper foot. Upon this one article we might, if we had imitated the <HI>Dutch,</HI> have saved a sum much above half a million <HI>per annum,</HI> which would have kept the nation clear of this mountanious load of debt, which is now sinking it into bankruptcy and ruin. We find, that when the army was about 18,000, the charge was above 5 or 600,000<HI>l. per annum.</HI> From this it is easy to compute what an expence the devour|ing army has cost, especially of late, since it has been so frightfully numerous.</P>
<P>The commons, in their remonstrance, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1628, complain of the army in time of peace, and of <HI>Back|ingham</HI>'s standing commission as general. We esta|blish from year to year, a great army at an immense expence, while the nation is drowned in debt; and while no mortal can conceive from what quarter exter|nal danger can come upon us.

<P>In the year 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">7, when the subject of the army was argued on both sides, the principal topick in favour of it was taken from the practice of the neigh|bouring nations, whose keeping up a standing force makes it necessary, said they, for us to do the same <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burn.</HI> HIST.

<P><PB N="359" REF="013851_0890_0F9E27C1504BAD38">
<Q>Sir, The commander in chief of our army may make himself master of many of our elections; and where he cannot by such means make himself master, he may do as <HI>Caius Marius</HI> did at <HI>Rome,</HI> he may give private orders to his soldiers to murder any one that shall dare to set himself up as a candidate against the man he has recommended. For the first attempt that great and wicked <HI>Roman</HI> made against the liber|ties of his country, was to get his soldiers to murder the man who stood candidate for the tribuneship in opposition to the person he patronized; and the <HI>Roman</HI> soldiers were even by that time become so abandoned, so lost to all sense of law or liberty, that they readily obeyed their general's orders, though he was then out of command, and though it was about 100 years after the end of the second <HI>Punic</HI> war, and not above 150 years after the <HI>Romans</HI> first began to keep the same army under military law for a number of years together. For though the <HI>Romans</HI> from the very first origin of their city were almost continually engaged in wars, yet those wars were always for the first 500 years carried on by fresh armies; so that it seldom happened that any number of their troops were above a year without returning to enjoy the happiness of freedom and liberty. By this custom, their citizens continued all to be soldiers, and their soldiers to be citizens; but soon after they began to keep up and carry on their wars by stand|ing armies, their citizens lost that warlick spirit, and their soldiers that love of liberty by which alone the freedom of government can be preserved. For this reason, Sir, we ought to be careful not to give the meanest soldier of our army an occasion to think that he is in a state of slavery: On the contrary, we should, as far as is consistent with the nature of

<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> were startled at the fight of 120 lic|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ors, or peace-officers for the guard of the decemviri. Such an army was dangerous, they said, to liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="013851_0893_0F9E27C55221A1D0">What would those jealous old <HI>Romans,</HI> what would our stern forefathers have said, had they seen 18,000 mercenary soldiers kept up in this free country (whose natural guard is a militia, and a fleet equal in force to that of all <HI>Europe</HI> put together) in a time of profound peace, in spite of all the repeated and continued remon|strances of all men of public spirit for ages, at the same time that our governors do not know how to defray the necessary charges of government, and the nation is plunged in a bottomless sea of debt.</P>
<P>When <HI>Rome</HI> was thought to be in the utmost danger from the contest between <HI>Sylla</HI> and <HI>Marius,</HI> the consul <HI>Octavius</HI> was advised to arm the slaves for the preserva|tion of the republic.

<P><HI>Sylla,</HI> on the contrary, gave liberty, citizenship, and arms, to 10,000 slaves, to attach them to his interest; breaking through all principles of the constitution, to gain his own ambitious views.</P>

Many of the members were offended at the king's recommending so strongly an army of land-forces.

<P>Every opportunity a minister and his tools have of embezzling the public money is an evil. The keep|ing up of a numerous standing army furnishes this very plentifully.

The annual estimate of the army in those times used to be about 700,000<HI>l</HI>; one third of which, therefore, or 233,000<HI>l.</HI> a year, must have been sunk in certain pockets.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A Militia with the Navy, the only proper Security of a free People in an insular Situation, both against foreign Invasion and domestic Tyranny.</HEAD>
<P>A Standing army, as those on the continent, con|tinues, of course, from year to year, without any new appointment, and is a part of the constitution. Our courtiers affect to call the <HI>British</HI> land-establishment a parliamentary army, and would deceive us into the notion of a difference between a standing army and a parliamentary. The <HI>British</HI> land-forces, say they, are appointed from year to year, not only as to their number, but their subsistence; so that the parliament's neglecting to provide for their subsistence would be annihilating the army at once. But is the army the less a grievance for its being on this foot, than if it were on the same with those of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain?</HI> Suppose that for twenty years together, we should have no parliament called. At the end of that period, could the grievance and loss to the nation be estimated as at all less upon the
<PB N="390" REF="013851_0921_0F9E27E252928828">
whole, than it would have been, if the king had at the beginning of the twenty years, declared by edict, that there should be no parliament during that period? This would be a bolder stroke of tyranny, than merely neglecting, from year to year, or refusing, to let the writs be issued; but the people would be as really deprived of the advantages of parliaments by one proceeding, as by the other.</P>
<P><Q>No kingdom can be secured otherwise than by arming the people. The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He, who has nothing, and who himself belongs to another, must be defended by him, whose property he is, and needs no arms. But he, who thinks he is his own master, and has what he can call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself, and what he possesses; else he lives precariously, and at discretion. And though for a while, those, who have the sword in their power, abstain from doing him injury, yet by degrees he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command. Our ancestors</Q>

<P>Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> gives <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">p. 54.</NOTE> the plan of a militia for <HI>Bri|tain.</HI> He proposes three camps in <HI>England,</HI> and one in <HI>Scotland</HI>; and that every youth of every rank should spend one or two years in the camp, at his coming of age, and perform military exercise once every week afterwards. But a great deal less than this would&punc; be sufficent to make this, or any populous island innaccessible to a foreign enemy. If we had in <HI>Britain</HI> a sea and land militia, there would be no oc|casion for the scandalous practice of pressing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenian</HI> and <HI>Spartan</HI> militia conquered the <HI>Persian</HI> mercenary armies, though infinitely more numerous. The greatest part of <HI>Alexander</HI>'s army was militia. The <HI>Romans</HI> conquered all nations, in the republican times, while their army was an unpaid militia. In the imperial times, when the army was hired, the northern militia drove them out of one province after another, and at last <HI>Odoacer</HI> made him|self king of <HI>Italy.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> had more trouble in subduing the militia of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Epirus,</HI> than in conquering all their empire besides. <HI>Scanderbeg,</HI> with a small militia, was constantly successful in 22 battles against standing armies. <HI>Hunniades</HI> and <HI>Matthias</HI> fought the <HI>Turkish</HI> standing armies always with militia,
<Q>and performed such actions as posterity can hardily believe.</Q></P>

that rich and populous city. But when the <HI>Romans,</HI> in order to support the arbitrary power of their emperors, began to put their whole trust in merce|nary armies, their military glory soon began to decline; and at last the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> and other northern nations, by means of their militia, drove before them the mercenary armies of <HI>Rome,</HI> and made that proud city submit to the yoke which she had, in former times, by the same means, put upon a great part of the world <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P><Q><HI>La constitution de</HI> Rome, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The constitution of <HI>Rome</HI> was founded upon this principle, That those only should be soldiers, who had property to answer to the republic for their conduct. The equestrians, as being the richest, formed the cavalry of the legions.

<P><Q>At the conclusion of the first <HI>Punic</HI> war, the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> were compelled, by their treaty with the <HI>Romans,</HI> to evacuate <HI>Sicily. Gisco,</HI> therefore, who commanded in that island, to prevent the dis|orders which might be committed by such a multi|tude of desperate fellows, composed of so many dif|ferent nations, and so long inured to blood and rapine, sent them over gradually in small bodies, that his countrymen might have time to pay off their arrears, and send them home to their respec|tive countries. But either the lowness of their finances, or the ill timed parsimony of the <HI>Cartha|ginians,</HI>
<PB N="393" REF="013851_0924_0F9E27E61DEE9518">
totally defeated this salutary measure, though the wisest that, as their affairs were at that time circumstanced, could possibly have been taken. The <HI>Carthaginians</HI> deferred their payment till the arrival of the whole body, in hopes of obtaining some abatement in their demands, by fairly laying before them the necessities of the public. But the merce|naries were deaf to every representation and proposal of that nature. They felt their own strength, and saw too plainly the weakness of their masters. As fast as one demand was agreed to, a more unreason|able one was started; and they threatened to do themselves justice by military execution, if their exorbitant demands were not immediately com|plied with. At last, when they were just at the point of an accomodation with their masters, by the mediation and address of <HI>Gisco,</HI> two desperate ruffians, named <HI>Spendius</HI> and <HI>Mathos,</HI> raised such a flame among the unruly multitude, as broke out instantly into the most bloody and destructive war ever yet recorded in history. The account we have of it from the <HI>Greek</HI> historians must strike the most callous breast with horror; and though it was at last happily terminated by the superior conduct of <HI>Hamilcar Barcas,</HI> the father of the great <HI>Hannibal,</HI> yet it continued near four years, and left the terri|tories around <HI>Carthage</HI> a most shocking scene of blood and devastation. Such was, and ever will be, the consequence, when a large body of merce|nary troops is admitted into the heart of a rich and fertile country, where the bulk of the people are denied the use of arms by the mistaken policy of their governors. For this was actually the case with the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> where the total disuse of arms amongst the lower class of people laid that opulent country
<PB N="394" REF="013851_0925_0F9E27E6D5BB0CA0">
open, an easy and tempting prey to every invader. This was another capital error, and consequently ano|ther cause which contributed to their ruin. How must any nation, but our own, which, with respect to the bulk of the people, lies in the same defenceless situation, how, I say, must they censure the mighty state of <HI>Carthage</HI> spreading terror and giving law to the most distant nations by her powerful fleets, when they see her at the same time trembling, and giving herself up for lost at the landing of an invader in her own territories <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mountague,</HI> ANT.

<P><Q>I hope the enemies to a militia will at least allow those new levies, who composed by far the gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">est part of <HI>Hamilcar</HI>'s army upon this occasion, to be raw, undisciplined, and ignorant of the use of arms, epithets which they bestow so plentifully upon a militia. Yet that able commander, with an army consisting chiefly of this kind of men, totally de|stroyed an army of desperate veterans, took their general, and all who escaped the slaughter, prisoners, and put an end to the most ruinous and most inhu|man war ever yet mentioned in history. These new levies had courage, a quality never yet, I believe, disputed to the <HI>British</HI> commonalty, and were to fight <HI>pro aris et focis,</HI> For whatever was dear and valuable to a people; and <HI>Hamilcar,</HI> who well knew how to make use of these dispositions of his countrymen, was master of those abilities which <HI>Mathos</HI> wanted.

<P>When the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> over-ran the western parts of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire (says <HI>Fletcher</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI>) the generals of armies made themselves kings of the countries they conquered.

<PB N="397" REF="013851_0928_0F9E27E911E07A20">
vassals, and held by military service. The king's revenue arose out of his demesne lands. There was no mercenary army. Every man was a soldier, obliged to fight for his superior; upon which tenure he held his lands. This continued to be the state of things in <HI>Europe</HI> for about 1100 years from <HI>A.

Yet it is manifest, that a militia is the only natural defence of a free country both from invasion and tyranny. For who is so likely to defend property, as the proprietor? It was the carelessness of the people, that gave kings the opportunity of setting up tyrannies, and armies for supporting those tyran|nies. Rich and luxurious people chose rather to pay than fight.

They would defend it better than merce|naries, men of desperate fortunes, who have no hopes, but in the public calamity, who, for money, would attempt any thing, and whose faith would follow for|tune's wheel. The queen dowager was afraid to push the scheme; but <HI>Mary</HI> took it up, on pretence of <HI>Bothwel</HI>'s having a design to seize her person. The army, however, was soon abolished, and <HI>Iam.</HI> I. when king of <HI>Scotland,</HI> had only forty gentlemen for his guard.

<P><HI>Fletcher</HI> answers the objection, That only a standing army can defend us against the standing army of <HI>France.</HI> He says, in our wars with <HI>France,</HI> our naval power ought chiefly to be trusted to. Mercenary troops are calculated, he says, to enslave a nation. They are composed of men, who make a trade of war; of detached ruffians freed from shame and con|nexion with their country for life; whereas a militia are to return again among the people after serving a certain number of years. <HI>Caesar,</HI> in order to en|slave his country, continued the same men beyond

<P>Mr. <HI>Fletcher</HI> adds afterwards what follows.</P>
<P><Q>The essential quality of a militia consistent with

freedom is, That the officers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and pre|ferred, and they, and the soldie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> maintained, not by the prince but the people, who send them out. Ambitious princes [and he would have added, if he had fore-known the late duke of <HI>Newcastle</HI>'s opposition to the establishment of the militia, <HI>corrupt ministers</HI>] have always endeavoured to discredit the militia, and render it burdensome to the people, by never suffer|ing it to be upon any right, or even tollerable foot|ing; all to persuade the necessity of standing forces. In the battle of <HI>Naseby,</HI> the number of forces was equal on both sides; and all circumstances equal. In the parliament's army only nine officers had ever seen actual service, and most of the soldiers were <HI>London</HI> prentices, drawn out of the city two months before. In the king's army there were above 1000 officers, who had served abroad; yet the regulars were routed by the prentices. A good militia is of such i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">portance to a nation, that it is the chief part of the constitution of every free government. For, though, as to other things, the constitution be ever so slight, a good militia will always preserve the public liberty; and in the best constitution ever known, as to all other parts of government, if the militia be not upon a right foot, the liberty of the people must perish. The militia of antient <HI>Rome</HI> made her mistress of the world. Standing armies enslaved her. The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> continued 800 years free, because they had a good militia. The <HI>Swiss</HI> are the freest people in our times, and like to continue such the longest, because they have the best militia.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fletcher</HI>'s WORKS, p. 31, 42, 54.</NOTE></Q></P>

from its original intention and use, this ought not to hinder all men of property from learning the use of arms. There is no law against a free subject's ac|quiring any laudable accomplishment. And if the generality of housekeepers were only half-disciplined, a designing prince, or ministry, would hardly dare to provoke the people by an open attack on their li|berties, lest they should find means to be completely instructed in the exercise of arms before the chain could be rivetted. But without the people's having some knowledge of arms, I see not what is to secure them against slavery, whenever it shall please a daring prince, or minister, to resolve on making the expe|riment.

<P>The militia-act is long and intricate; whereas there was nothing necessary, but to direct, that every third man in every parish in <HI>England,</HI> whose house had 10 or more windows, should be exercised in his own parish, by an experienced serjeant, times every year, the days to be appointed; and every third part of every parish to be upon the list for three years, and free six years, so that in nine years every such housekeeper in <HI>England</HI> might have had all the know|ledge he could acquire by field-days. The men never to be drawn out of their respective parishes, but to resist an invasion, quell an insurrection, or for some necessary purpose.

<P>A country, in which every man of property could defend his property, could have no occasion for a dan|gerous standing army, and would be incomparably

<P>Lord <HI>Lyttleton</HI> thinks the militia (the only perma|nent military force, our ancestors knew) was com|manded by the heretoch of every county, who was annually chosen into his office by the freeholders in the folkmote, or county-court; and that after the <HI>Norman</HI> times, this command devolved upon the earl of each county.</P>
<P>A militia consisting of any others than the men of <HI>property</HI> in a country, is no militia; but a mungrel army.</P>
<P>Men of business and property will never chuse to enter into the militia, if they may be called from their homes, and their business for three years, toge|ther, subject to martial law all the while.</P>

There is no advantage we have ever gained by war, which would not have been greater, and cost us incomparably less, if we had kept to the sea. For we never can have a nation for our enemy that is not commercial, and we can certainly at any time force a commercial nation to yield to reasonable terms by attacking their commerce, their foreign settlements, their coast-towns, their fisheries, &amp;c.

<P>In the year 1749, the number of sailors voted, was 1500, at the same time that the land forces were to be 18,857. It would have been more natural to imagine that parliament would vote the large number for the sea service, and the small one for the land.

<P>Mr. <HI>Thornton</HI> moved, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1751, to bring in a bill to make the militia more useful. He said he had searched into the causes that rendered the militia weak
<PB N="413" REF="013851_0944_0F9E27FC932CE3C8">
and contemptible, and the remedy would not be either difficult or tedious. He said the militia laws had been spoiled by design, that some villainous clauses had been artfully intruded into them, which were previously known to be such as would render them entirely useless. But a well constituted militia in the year 1745 would have saved the nation 3,000,000<HI>l.</HI> and tho' it might cost the nation 10,000<HI>l</HI> a year, and there should be occasion to use it but once in thirty years, which was the space between the two last rebellions, we should then have had that service for 300,000<HI>l.</HI> which has cost us 3,000,000<HI>l.</HI> and that it was evident, that less labour would be lost by 200,000 militia, who would immediately return to their work, supposing that two days only in a month were set apart for their exercise, than by 20,000 regular troops, who consider every species of industry as incompatible with their station, or their duty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm</HI> DEB.

<P>The bill was ordered to be committed.</P>
<P>In the year 1756 was published a collection of 43 addresses to the king, and instructions to members of parliament, from <HI>London, Bristol,</HI> and many counties, &amp;c. complaining of the loss of <HI>Minorca,</HI> and other mis|carriages, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">casioned in great measure by the want of a <HI>militia,</HI> to secure the mother-country, which would have allowed sending out a sufficient force to de|fend <HI>Minorca,</HI> &amp;c.

<P><Q>That six or seven thousand men unprovided with horses, with magazines, and many of them with arms, should march from the extemities of <HI>Scotland</HI> to within eighty miles of <HI>London,</HI> through a country that abhorred their manners, and detested their cause; and that they should return to <HI>Scotland</HI> without losing above fifty men by death or desertion, is next to in|cridible. Upon their return, they were guilty of many excesses in plundering the inhabitants of the country, which they had forborne when they marched into <HI>England.</HI> This was owing to the chagrin they had conceived at their disappointment; yet they were not accused of being sanguinary to the people of the country, though it was said in the skirmish at <HI>Clifton</HI> some of them called out to give no quarter to the king's troops. But their success in a great measure may be accounted for by the dissi|milarity of manners between them and their enemies. Bred up in hardy, active, and and obstemious&punc; courses of life, they were always prepared to march, and ne|ver at a loss for accomodation or provision: they were devoted to enthusiasm to the cause they were engaged in, and they thought no crime was equal to the disobedience of the commands of their leaders, who, during their march into <HI>England,</HI> sought all means to conciliate the minds of the people to their interest. The common people of <HI>England,</HI> on the other hand, having been long used to pay an army for fight|ing for them, had at this time forgot all the millitary virtues of their ancestors. The militia, therefore, was useless, and few but those who regularly en|tered into the service of the government chose in their own persons to venture any thing against the rebels.

They depended upon the army for their protection, and it was found by experience that the unweildy motions of the regulars gave their enemies a vast advantage, by rendering it next to impossible to come up with them.

in some proportion command them? I say, these and other like things may be done, and some of them are done, in our own plantations, and the islands of <HI>Iersey</HI> and <HI>Guernsey</HI>; as also in <HI>Poland, Switzerland,</HI> and the country of the <HI>Grisons,</HI> which are nations much less considerable than <HI>England,</HI> have as formidable neighbours, no seas, nor fleet to defend them, nothing but a militia to depend upon, and yet no one dares to attack them.

And so it would be with us, if the court would give their hearty assistance in promoting this design; if the king would appear in person at the head of them, and give rewards and honours to such as deserve them, we should quickly see the young nobility and gentry appear magnificiently in arms and equipage, shew a generous emulation in outvying one another in military exer|cises, and place a noble ambition in making them|selves serviceable to their country. They object, that such a militia as this is a standing army, and will be as dangerous and much more chargeable. I answer, That there can be no danger from an army, where the nobility and gentry of <HI>England</HI> are the commanders, and the body of it made up of the freeholders, their sons and servants; unless we can conceive that the nobility and gentry will join in an unnatural design to make void their own titles to their estates and liberties; and if they could enter|tain so ridiculous a proposition, they would never be obeyed by the soldiers, who will have a respect to those that send them forth, and pay them, and to whom they must return when their time is ex|pired.

For if I find a man, I will as surely chuse one who will fight for me, as a mercenary officer will chuse one, that will.

A strong recommendation of a militia!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thronton, A. D.</HI> 1751, made the following remarks in the house of commons <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. V.20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q>I must not omit to take notice that the militia laws have been opposed by design; some villainous clauses having been artfully intruded into them, which were previously known to be such as would render them entirely useless. As this cannot be denied, I persuade myself, that after a very little re|flection, every gentleman present will concur in my opinion, that some alteration is necessary with respect to our militia, eit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er to commence now, or at a more convenient seaso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> or, at least, at the eve of a commotion, when their assistance shall be wanted to surmount the danger which we would not prevent. If our militia is not to be frequently exercised, let there be some law, by which it may be more effectually raised. Let us no longer ac|knowledge the importance of a militia in the pre|amble of many of our statutes, yet render this very
<PB N="420" REF="013851_0951_0F9E280534710898">
militia ineffectual by suffering such destructive clauses to remain, as will reduce the statute itself to a mere form of words, and a dead letter, to the astonishment of other nations, and the disgrace of our own. Let us, Sir, repeal all the present laws concerning the militia; we shall then evidently perceive our naked|ness, and in what a defenceless state they will leave us. Let us no longer be amused with the appearance of a security, which they cannot give; nothing more, surely, than the discovery of our danger, is necessary to put us immediately upon our guard; nothing more is necessary to determine us to enact laws which shall be in effect what the present laws are only in form; and I hope we shall, upon this occasion, remember the great maxim of <HI>Cosmo de Medicis,</HI> from whom <HI>Machiavel</HI> derived all his po|litical knowledge; Defer not till to-morrow what can and ought to be done to-day. A regulation, Sir, by which our country is to be defended against superstition and slavery, against the fury of an in|vasion, or the rapine of rebellion, requires the most mature and dispassionate deliberation. Shall we, therefore, defer this regulation, till we hear the drum of an enemy beat to arms? Shall we defer it till every heart throbs with apprehension, and every mind is confused with anxiety and terror? Till impatience for obtaining the end shall cause us to mistake the means? Till a time when a hypocritical zeal for the safety of the public taking advantage of the con|fusion, shall bring us into greater danger? Were not the very clauses that have emasculated our statutes re|lating to the militia introduced in the time of public and imminent danger, by designing men, who under a pretence of increasing our security, took away what security we had?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="421" REF="013851_0952_0F9E28064A1BD078"><Q>Let us then in this interval of tranquility, when the mind is at leisure to examine and chuse, set about changing these ruinous clauses for such as will be quite proper. Let us now establish our safety upon a firm foundation, by passing such a law as will furnish this country with a militia equally effective, more easily raised, and maintained at a less expence than that of any other nation in the world; let us no longer trust our liberty and our lives, our religion, our country and our posterity, to a mercenary army, that has no motive to defend us, but its pay, and no concern for our liberties, because they have given up their own.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If it should happen, Sir, that a large military force should suddenly be wanted at a time when the parliament is not sitting, and his majesty is abroad, how is it to be supplied? Will not the waiting for an act of parliament produce the most dangerous delay? And will not the same inconveniences follow, that happened in the year 1745? Inconveniences, which we now feel, and which will probably be long felt by our posterity. A well constituted militia, Sir, at that time, would have saved the nation 3,000,000<HI>l.</HI> and if it be admitted that such a militia would be attended with an annual expence to the whole nation of 10,000<HI>l.</HI> and that there should be occasion to use it but once in thirty years, which is the space between the two last rebellions, we should then have that service for 300,000<HI>l.</HI> which has cost us 3,000,000<HI>l.</HI> and consequently save (which would be good oeconomy, instead of superfluous expence) 2,700,000<HI>l.</HI> upon the balance. Besides, those whom the want of this force might encourage to interrupt our tranquillity, may be deterred from their attempt by observing that a new regulation hath rendered us
<PB N="422" REF="013851_0953_0F9E28065767F568">
sufficiently formidable. To prevent is certainly still better than to cure. These considerations, Sir, appear so formidable to me, that I cannot think any gentleman will continue to oppose, or even on any account to delay the measure which they have induced me to undertake and recommend. But, Sir, lest any gentleman should doubt whether this measure be practicable, I shall observe, that the establishment of a militia in any country, where the people are nume|rous and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ustrious, is not only practicable, but easy. <HI>Switzerland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> which are poor countries, thinly inhabited, have their militia, not|withstanding the people must be necessarily dissipated by the great extent of the lands which they cultivate. And is a militia impossible in <HI>England?</HI> A country that is remarkable for its fertility, and crouded with men, where a few acres afford a plentiful subsistence, and almost every parish could furnish a regiment. If it be objected, that this militia cannot be exercised without taking the husbandman or the manufacturer from his labour, a circumstance which cannot but be hurtful to a trading nation; I answer, our militia may be exercised on holidays, according to the practice in <HI>Switzerland</HI>; but supposing that two days in a month were to be set apart for this purpose, it is evident that less labour would be lost by 200,000 militia, who would immediately return to their work from their exercise, than by 20,000 regular troops, who consider themselves as gentlemen soldiers, and every species of industry as incompatible with their station, and indeed with their duty. I would not, however, be thought an advocate for the total re|duction of the army. I know that an army is necessary, that there must be guards and some troops, at our garrisons, in <HI>Gibraltar</HI> and <HI>Port Mahon,</HI> and a
<PB N="423" REF="013851_0954_0F9E280711627468">
sufficent number of regular forces in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the islands of <HI>Scotland</HI> and the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> But I think such a reduction of the army is expedient, as would cause a saving equivalent to the expence of 260,000 militia, and that enough would still remain for the above services. This number, Sir, of 260,000 for the militia was our ancient contingent; and as they are dispersed through the several counties of this island, will effectually repress, if not prevent any invasion from abroad, and quell every disb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rbance that may be fomented at home. They will be always ready in every part of the kingdom to assist the civil power, as well as to protect our coasts from insult; coasts of such extent, that if the present standing army was doubled, it would not be able to secure the island from being plundered in some part or other, by the daring crew of a buccaneer, or a desperate association of smugglers. And as it is our coast that principally makes a millitary force of any kind necessary, what must be our situation, when without any force by which this coast can be secured, and with scarce a fortified place in the kingdom, we are not able to bring together 6000 men for the defence of the capital, upon a sudden and unexpected attack? The marshals <HI>Belleisle</HI> and <HI>Saxe</HI> both re|marked, that we must be easily over-run; and it is a common saying among the <HI>French,</HI> that <HI>England</HI> would be only a breakfast:</Q>
[But then the <HI>French</HI> must give up the troops they send against us; because our fleet would effectually out of their retreat:]
<Q>And I should be sorry if they should put us to prove the contrary, before we have a militia established. Need we have a better hint, or stronger motive to provide for our safety? <HI>Fas est ab hoste doceri.</HI> As to the difficulty of reforming our militia, if it be said that
<PB N="424" REF="013851_0955_0F9E280A417F5CA0">
experiment is against me, and that experiment is stronger than argument; if it be alledged that former attempts to establish a militia have been ineffectual, it needs only to be considered by what means these at|tempts have been made. They were made in conse|quence of those very statutes which being perverted from their primary intentions are evidently <HI>felo de se</HI>; so that the militia, which was designed to be a regular and well-disciplined body, is degenerated into a mere mob: But even this mob has been known to do good service. I will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> trespass, Sir, upon the indulgence of the house by proving self-evident propositions: It is sufficient only to state them. It is of absolute necessity we should have a millitary force sufficient to defend eleven millions of people, and it is acknow|ledged on all hands that our present force is not sufficient. There are but three ways by which this deficiency can be supplied; first, by a regular army of mercenaries; secondly, by foreign auxiliaries; thirdly, by a militia. A regular army of mercenaries we can neither afford to pay for living in idleness, nor spare from the trades in which they would be other|wise employed. The hiring of auxiliaries is attended with equal expence, and is yet less to be depended upon: For they who may be engaged to supply auxiliaries to us, may, when we want them, be scarce able to defend themselves, as was the case in the unhappy year 1745. Auxiliaries may be bought off by our enemy at the very minute we want them, or sent under restrictions, which will render them wholly unserviceable. There needs not indeed any argument to prove a measure to be impolitic, which has already incumbered us with debts, that it is scarce possible we shold pay, and has reduced our neigh|bours, the <HI>Dutch,</HI> into yet more deplorable poverty
<PB N="425" REF="013851_0956_0F9E280B68E281C8">
and distress. A militia, which would defend us by men of property, whose interest is involved in that of their country, and who would only circulate their pay, and not carry it abroad, must be our only re|source. Such a militia, Sir, has been rejected by those who have had the management of this unhappy country, who have, for reasons best known to them|selves, squandered the public treasure in vain attempts to obtain from foreign and domestic mercenaries what a militia only can supply, [the duke of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> the importer of 12,000 <HI>Hessians</HI> and <HI>Hanoverians, A. D..</HI> 1756.] Let us then interpose in the behalf of an injured nation; let us once more connect the civil and military power, and direct their united efforts to the same end. This, as it will give us strength at home, will give us reputation abroad. This is advised by <HI>Machiavel,</HI> as the surest means of national greatness: This was successfully practised by the <HI>Spartans</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> of old, the <HI>Goths</HI> and ancient <HI>Germans</HI>; and this is now the glory of the <HI>Swiss,</HI> a nation which, however inconsiderable in its extent, no ambitious power has dared to molest. I therefore humbly move, that leave may be given to bring in a bill for the good purpose that I have mentioned.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1758, the ministry pretended to consi|der the militia as capable of real service. For we find in that year a message from the king by Mr. <HI>Pitt,</HI> That he is informed of a <HI>French</HI> invasion, and may perhaps have occasion for the militia.

<P>It was observed in parliament, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1674,
<Q>That neither our ancestors, nor the people of any country, free, like ours, whilst they preserved their liberties, did ever suffer any mercenary or standing guards around their prince; but chose that his safety should be in them, as theirs was in him.</Q></P>
<P>A motion was made, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1717, for a supply for maintaing the army. Opposed by <HI>Shippen, Wind|ham, Walpole,</HI> jacobites and discontented whigs to|gether. The same <HI>Walpole</HI> afterwards kept up a more numerous army than 18,000, of which number he complains heavily here <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. VI.154.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="013851_0958_0F9E280C60E33C38">All the arguments in favour of a standing army, Mr. <HI>Shippen</HI> said, were reducible to two propositions. 1.
<Q>That the only danger of continuing the standing army is the expence of it. 2. That we ought to comply with the number of forces proposed, because it is demanded by the king, who is the best judge of our necessities.</Q></P>
<P>He said, <Q>it was very extraordinay, that the ex|pence should be thought the only danger, for that was not the chief argument against a standing army; but the chief argument was, that the civil and military power could not long subsist together; that a standing army in time of peace would necessarily impede the free execution of the laws of the land.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is the infelicity of his majesty's reign, that he is unacquainted with our language and constitution, therefore it is incumbent on his ministers to inform him, that our government does not stand on the same foundation with his <HI>German</HI> dominions. That a standing army supposes not only a distrust, but weakness in the government; and therefore could not promote his majesty's service.</Q>
He said,
<Q>some of the freest and bravest people in <HI>Europe</HI> had, by this method, lost their liberties. The civil power was drawn in from time to time, by pretended exigencies, to allow and maintain an armed force in peace; but they found they had erected a power superior to themselves; that the soldiery, when they had tasted the sweets of authority, would not part with it; and that even their princes began to think, that ruling by an army was a more compen|dious way of government, than acting under the restrainsts of law.

<Q>I know these assertions inter|fere with what is laid down in his majesty's speech; but we are to consider that speech as the composition and advice of the ministry, and are therefore at liberty to debate every proposition in it; especially those, which seem rather calculated for the meridian of <HI>Germany,</HI> than of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It was said, the above words were highly disho|nourable to, and unjustly reflecting on, his majesty's person and government; and therefore it was ordered, that <HI>Wm. Shippen,</HI> Esq. be, for the said offence, committed prisoner to the Tower.</P>
<P><Q>If the prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> (says <HI>Trenchard</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">HIST. ARMIES, p. 97.</NOTE>) in his declaration, instead of telling us, that we should be settled upon such a foundation, that there should be no danger of our falling again into slavery, and that he would send back all his forces as soon as that was done, had promised us that after an eight years war (which should leave us in debt near twenty millions) we should have a standing army established, a great many of which should be foreigners; I believe few men would have thought such a revolu|tion worth the hazard of their lives and estates; but his mighty soul was above such abject thoughts as these; his declaration was his own, these paltry designs are those of our undertakers, who would shelter their own oppressions under his sacred name. I would willingly know, whether the late king <HI>Iames</HI> II. could have enslaved us but by an army, and whether there is any way of securing us from falling again into slavery, but by disbanding the army. It was in that sense I understood his ma|jesty's declaration, and therefore did early take up
<PB N="429" REF="013851_0960_0F9E280E16F4BD50">
arms for him, as I shall be always ready to do. It was this alone which made his assistance necessary to us, otherwise we had wanted none but the hang|man's.</Q></P>
<P>It is a common evasion of the advocates for the army, that we have only such a number, 12,000, or 20,000, in <HI>England,</HI> and that the rest are in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where they cannot annoy us, and are necessary there to keep the raw-head-and-bloody-bones-papists quiet. But neither is there any honest use for one regiment in <HI>England</HI> nor in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the people being, if only half disciplined, as able as the army both to keep the internal peace, and deter invaders; of which the histories of all the ages between <HI>Richard</HI> II. and <HI>Charles</HI> I. are vouchers; nor is the keeping an army in <HI>Ireland</HI> at all less dangerous to <HI>British</HI> liberty than in <HI>England.</HI> Hear Mr. <HI>Trenchard:</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">HIST.

<Q>An army kept in <HI>Ireland</HI> is more dangerous to us than at home: For here, by perpetual converse with their relations and acquaintance, some few of them perhaps may warp towards their country; whereas in <HI>Ireland</HI> they are kept as it were in a garrison, where they are shut up from the communication of their countrymen, and may be nursed up in another interest. It is a common policy amongst arbitrary princes often to shift their soldiers quarters, lest they should contract friendship among the natives, and by degrees fall into their interest.</Q></P>

of her court; he asked her, amidst so much splendor, where were her guards? Which question she resolved a few days after, as she took him in her coach through the city, when pointing to the people (who received her in crowds with repeated acclama|tions)
'These, said she, my lord, are my guards; these have their hands, their hearts, and their purses, always ready at my command.'
And these were guards indeed, who defended her through a long and successful reign of forty-four years against all the ma|chinations of <HI>Rome,</HI> the power of <HI>Spain,</HI> a disputed title, and the perpetual conspiracies of her own po|pish subjects; a security the <HI>Roman</HI> emperors could not boast of with their praetorian bands, and their eastern and western armies.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Were not the <HI>French</HI> as powerful, says Mr. <HI>Gor|don</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">TRACTS, I.26.</NOTE>, in <HI>Charles</HI> IId's and <HI>Iames</HI> Ist's times, as they are in this long and destructive war, and with a weaker alliance to oppose them?

<P>It was urged, that there was a great necessity to reduce the expences of the nation; [What was the necessity then compared with that of our times?] and that it might best be done by reducing the standing army, which in time of peace was not necessary, but was absolutely inconsistent with the liberties of the people.</P>
<P>To which it was answered, that they might as well address the king to govern according to law; that it was insinuating that the king did not take the first opportunity of reducing the army, and thereby lessen|ing

<P>The duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> brought into the house of lords, the same year, a bill to prevent the officers of the army below the rank of colonels from being deprived of their commissions otherwise than by court martial, or address of parliament <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, IV.186.</NOTE>. This was in|tended for detaching military officers from all con|nection with and dependence on the ministry. Be|fore the second-reading, many lords called out for the question; the plain <HI>English</HI> of which is, Right or wrong, we are against this bill. Lord <HI>Chesterfield</HI> checked them severely. Lord <HI>Hervey</HI> said, the bill was an open and direct attack on the royal prerogative, (of which elsewhere) and might overset the constitu|tion, &amp;c. The Truth is, that supposing parliament itself under ministerial influence, as it was then, and has been since (I do not say, that is, in our virtuous times, the case) it is of very little consequence, whether the army be under ministerial influence through the mediation of parliament or otherwise.</P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="013851_0964_0F9E28119284E010">The bill of <HI>A. D.</HI> 1735, for quartering the army in time of elections<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

As the bill was first drawn, the offenders were to be tried in the <HI>King's-bench</HI>; but that constant friend to liberty the duke of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> proposed leaving out that clause, by which means the offending officers were to be left safe in the hands of the secretary at war, who generally having a good understanding with the mini|stry, would take care, that they should not be too severely punished, though they should stay, and take care of the minister's interest at an election; or in the words of one of the speakers<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid 473.</NOTE>, <Q>if an officer should bring his regiment, troop or company, to the very place of election, and plant centries to attend the poll-books, he knows how he is to be tried; he is to be tried by his brother officers in a court martial; and I do not know, but their sentence may be pleaded in bar to any future indictment brought

against him upon the statute of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. for what interpretations may hereafter be put upon this last law, cannot now be so easily determined: And therefore I hope your lordships will pass the bill in the same shape the learned judges have brought it in, unless some more convincing reason than any I have yet heard should be given for turning it into a form very different from that in which it is at present.</Q></P>
<P>And the protesting lords afterwards observed on this subject,
<Q>That it was much more necessary, that officers and soldiers should be subject to be tried by the civil power for an offence of this high nature against the constitution, than for quartering a man contrary to the method prescribed by the act to pre|vent mutiny and desertion; for which crime they are at present liable to be tried and cashiered by the civil magistrate.</Q>
They likewise observed, that the offence being against civil society, came much more naturally under the cognizance of the civil magistrate, than of a court-martial, as a court-martial on the other hand, is more competent to try military offences, than the civil magistrate<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, IV.485.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Afterwards another amendment, the wrong way, was made to the bill; by which the penalties, instead of being inflicted on the offending officers and soldiers, were to come upon the secretary at war, if he neglected to issue orders for the removal of the soldiery. Several lords protested, because they conceived, that
<Q>the leaving out of the clause would be defeating the effect and intention of the whole bill <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In the debate about the land-forces, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1735<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. IX.52.</NOTE>. it was argued by those, who were for augmenting the
<PB N="435" REF="013851_0966_0F9E28149C5F5610">
forces to 25,744 men, that <Q>events <HI>might</HI> happen,</Q> [so we are to be at a <HI>certain</HI> expence on account of what <HI>might</HI> happen]
that the affair of <HI>Poland,</HI> the only bone of contention publicly owned, was what <HI>England</HI> had little to do with; but if that <HI>should.</HI>
[what if it should <HI>not?</HI>] appear not to be the real motive to war; or if success <HI>should</HI> [what if it should <HI>not?</HI>]
<Q>encourage either side to extend their views, the balance of power</Q>
[ay the blessed balance of power, containing in one scale the enestimable electo|rate, and in the other the insignificant <HI>British</HI> empire]
<Q>may, at last, be brought into real danger, and then, for the sake of preserving the liberties of <HI>Europe,</HI></Q>
[why not the liberties of <HI>Asia?</HI>]
<Q>upon which the liberties of this nation will always depend, we must</Q>
[fight all the windmills on the continent]
<Q>take a principal share in the war.</Q>
In this <HI>convincing</HI> man|ner did the <HI>Walpolians</HI> in those days argue for increas|ing the standing army. But whether it was not by arguments of greater <HI>weight,</HI> that they gained a ma|jority in the house, is left to the reader. If the keep|ing up of a standing army of 40,000 men was now to be debated in the house of commons, our courtiers would be puzzled to find arguments as plausible as even the above drawn from <HI>Poland,</HI> and the bone of contention. It was observed by the opposers of the augmentation, that several of the princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> who were more immediately concerned, remained neutral, though they had, at that time,
<Q>large armies unemployed, which would be all sent to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> if they thought their country in any real danger, or that <HI>France</HI> had any design to impose an emperor upon them. While they remain so secure, while they give themselves so little concern about the

event of the war, why should we be so terribly fright|ened <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. IX.56.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>The insensible operation of prejudice in the most sincere, and intelligent minds, is very wonderful; and we cannot be too attentive to ourselves to guard against it. The great and good duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> in the debate, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1734, on the motion for addressing the king, to know, by whose advice the duke of <HI>Bolton</HI> and lord <HI>Cobham</HI> were removed from the com|mand of their regiments, spoke as follows, without laughing;
<Q>I hope, my lords, there are no gentlemen in the army, that ever were, or ever can be prevailed on, either to act or speak contrary to their conscience by the fear of their being turned out of their com|mission. I hope, there never will be any such in our army <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS. IV.215.</NOTE>.</Q>
And afterwards <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 216.</NOTE>,
<Q>What signifies a prerogative, if the king is never to make use of it, without being obliged to give an account to parlia|ment of his reasons for so doing?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Without a presumption, (says lord <HI>Carteret</HI>) that we are in circumstances of danger, no member of this house can agree to the keeping up of a standing army of 18,000 men, unless he thinks, such an army ought to be kept up even when the nation is in the greatest tranquillity and security; a way of thinking into which I hope no member of this house, nor any <HI>British</HI> subject, ever will come: for if this should ever be established as a maxim, a standing army of 18,000 men at least, would become a part of our constitution <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. V.239. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1738.</NOTE>.</Q>
[Which prediction we see fulfilled.]</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Carteret,</HI> on the rejection of the bill for making military officers independent on the ministry,
<PB N="437" REF="013851_0968_0F9E281620FCDAD0">
moved for an address to know who advised the re|moval of the duke of <HI>Bolton</HI> and lord <HI>Cobham</HI> from their regiments, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1734 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, IV.207.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The court lords said, This was breaking in upon the king's, that is, the minister's royal prerogative. Lord <HI>Bathurst</HI> answered, That it was the duty of the lords, as the king's hereditary counsellors, and was accordingly usual for them, to desire to be informed, who were the advisers of such exertions of the royal prerogative, as gave umbrage to themselves, or the people.
<Q>The army (he observed <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 211.</NOTE>) has really no de|pendence upon parliament. The king indeed de|pends upon parliament for a legal power to keep a standing army in time of peace, and for enabling him to pay them and discipline them according to law; but if in any future time the parliament should think it necessary to reduce a part of the army, and of con|sequence make no provision for their pay, the resolu|tion of parliament could not break any one regiment, or any part of any one regiment in the kingdom; the officers might all legally continue in their respective commands, and if the king then upon the throne should not think fit to break any of them, they might indeed then very probably think they had a good right to their pay, as long as they continued in co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mission, and if they could not get it by law, they might probably join with the king in raising it contrary to law, especially if he, foreseeing what would happen, had taken care to model them for that purpose, which any king might soon do while the army continues upon the same footing it is on at present. And for this reason, my lords, I must be of opinion that all these arguments which have been
<PB N="438" REF="013851_0969_0F9E28171892F848">
used for shewing us the danger of making an army independent, are so many arguments for shewing the danger of an army's being entirely dependent upon one branch only of our legislature, and consequently are good arguments for the bill, which was designed to make the army not entirely dependent upon any one, but upon all the three branches of our legisla|ture.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A. D.</HI> 1740, near forty lords protested against an augmentation of the army, because nothing less than absolute necessity should prevail for that purpose; because the ministry had made but an indifferent use of the great forces employed in the late war; because the pretence of disaffection to government, rendering a great army necessary, was groundless; [there was much dissatisfaction with the conduct of the ministry; but that was to be removed by correcting the errors of government, not by keeping up a formidable and odious standing army] because the army then on foot, with the fleet, was sufficient to secure the kingdom against invasion; because our allies might be better assisted by us with money, than with men; because <HI>France</HI> is no example for <HI>England,</HI> the forms of government in the two countries being totally dif|ferent; because adding to the number of officers is increasing the power of the ministry already too great, especially on the eve of a general election, which might give an incurable wound to the constitution; because the number of officers in parliament was con|tinually increasing, and that the ministry expect offi|cers to promote their schemes in parliament, appeared from a recent fact, viz. that the four eldest officers of the army were lately displaced, without any crime having being alledged against them; and ministerial arts in parliament, can alone destroy the essence of
<PB N="439" REF="013851_0970_0F9E2817A1EC6708">
the constitution, and open violence alone, the forms of it <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, VII.634.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is no end to the evils of a standing army. In this discourse (says Mr. <HI>Gordon</HI>) I have purposely omited speaking of the lesser inconveniencies attend|ing a standing army, such as frequent quarels, murders and roberies; the destruction of all the game in the country, the quartering upon public, and sometimes private houses; the influencing elec|tions of parliament, by an artificial distribution of quarters; the rendering so many men useless to labour, and almost to propagation, together with a much greater destruction of them by taking them from a laborious way of living, to a loose idle life; and besides this the insolence of the officers, and the debaucheries that are commited both by them, and their soldiers in all the towns they come into; the ruin of multitudes of women, dishonour of their families, and example to others; and a numerous train of mischiefs besides, almost endless to enume|rate. These are trivial grievances in respect of those I have treated above, which strike at the hearts blood of our constitution, and therefore I thought these not
<Q>considerable enough to bear a part in a discourse of this nature <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gord.</HI> TRACTS, I.28.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If the army be continued but a few years, it will be accounted a part of the prerogative, and it will be thought as great a violation to attempt the disband|ing it, as the guards in <HI>Ch.</HI> II's. time.

of king <HI>Iames</HI> IId's reign, excepting only that of his keeping up a standing army in time of peace; as if he had thought that no very great griev|ance. <HI>William</HI> promised, however, to send home the foreign forces he brought with him, as soon as he established a free parliament, liberty, and the protes|tant religion, &amp;c. [<HI>Burnet</HI> blamed him to his face very severely for establishing corruption] and he kept his word so well, that he and his parliament had al|most finally fallen out, because he would not send away his <HI>Dutch</HI> guards; so much are even good kings at|tached to power, and to armies, the instrument of power.</P>
<P>After much debating, voting, resolving, and dis|banding, the army establishment was settled. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1697, at 10,000, landmen, and 3000 marines, which last it was pretended, were not a land-force, but a water-force. Nor did the ministry accomplish the parliament's intention.</P>
<P><Q>Thus, (says Mr. <HI>Trenchard</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">HIST. OF STANDING ARMIES, p. 87.</NOTE>) what our courts for above 1000 years together never had the effron|tery to ask, what the pension parliament could not think of without astonishment, what <HI>Iames</HI>'s parlia|ment chosen almost by himself, could not hear de|bated with patience, we are likely to have the ho|nour of establishing under a deliverance.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Trenchard</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 84.</NOTE> throws out broad hints, that the strange and continual mismanagement of <HI>sea</HI> affairs in king <HI>William</HI>'s time, could hardly have come about any other way, than through a design of magnifying the importance of <HI>land</HI> armies.

who were yet very good whigs.

<P><Q>What I lament
(says the writer of LET. TO TWO GREAT MEN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>A. D.</HI> 1760. p. 46.</NOTE>.)
as the greatest misfortune that can threaten the public liberty, is to see the eagerness with which our nobility, born to be the guardians of the constitution against prerogative, solicit the badge of military subjection, not merely to serve their country in times of danger, which would be commendable; but in expectation to be continued soldiers, when tranquility shall be restored, and to be under military command during life. When I see this strange but melancholy infatuation so pre|valent, I almost despair of the constitution. If it should go on in proportion as it has of late, I fear the time will at last come, when independence on the crown will be exploded as unfashionable. Unless another spirit possesses our nobility; unless they lay aside their military trappings, and think they can serve their country more effectually as senators, than as soldiers, what can we expect, but to see the system of military subordination extending itself throughout the kingdom, universal dependance upon government influencing every rank of men, and the spirit, nay the very form, of the constitution de|stroyed. We have generally beaten the <HI>French,</HI> and always been foolish enough to follow their fashions. I was, however, in hopes we should never have taken
<PB N="443" REF="013851_0974_0F9E281D368C7270">

[the bill, of this year 1774, for the government of <HI>Canada</HI> is the very thing] but from our numerous armies, and the military turn of our nobility, I am afraid we are running into it as fast as we can. And unless something can be done to bring back our constitution to its first principles, we shall find that we have triumphed only to make ourselves as wretched as our enemy; that our conquests are but a poor compensation for the loss of our liberties; in a word, that, like <HI>Wolfe,</HI> falling in the arms of victory, we are most gloriously&mdash;undone.</Q></P>
<P>The vesting of courts-martial with the power of punishing with death in times of peace (the conse|quence of a standing army) was carried in the house of commons by a small majority, <HI>A.

Though afterwards, when he came to be a minister, he was better reconciled to standing armies and mutiny bills in times of peace; he never dared to ask above 17,000 men. We have now doubled that number. His demand produced a debate every year. He founded his pretended necessity for a standing army upon jaco|bitism. In our times, a minister could not bring out the word without laughing. Our ministers, there|fore, found it upon&mdash;upon&mdash;I profess I do not know what they found it upon, if it be not the necessity of keeping down the spirit of the people, enraged against corruption and peculation; or the necessity of find|ing places in the army, the war-office, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for their too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and the sons of their tools.</P>

As the towns in <HI>England</HI> will not be able much longer to contain quarters for them, most of those, who keep public houses, being near ruined by soldiers billeted on them; so, on pretence of the necessity of it, barracks will be built for quartering them, which will be as so many fortresses with strong garrisons in them, erected in all parts of <HI>England,</HI> which can tend to nothing but by degrees to subdue and enslave the kingdom. But if ever this scheme should be attempted, it will be incumbent on every <HI>Englishman</HI> to endeavour to prevent it by all methods; and as it would be the last stand that could be ever made for our liberties, rather than suffer it to be put in execu|tion, it would be our duty to draw our swords, and never put them up till our liberties were secured, and the authors of our intended slavery brought to condign punishment.</Q></P>
<P>Several lords protested on occasion of the election of 16 <HI>Scotch</HI> peers, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1735, when

<P>Lord <HI>Chesterfield</HI> endeavours, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1741, to shew that the strength of this country consists in our fleets, and not in our land forces.
<Q>That the fleets of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are equal in force and number of ships to the united navies of the greatest part of the world; that our admirals are men of known bravery, and long experience, and therefore formidable not only for real abilities and natural courage, but for the confidence which their presence necessarily excites in their followers, and the terror which must always accompany success, and enervate those who are accustomed to defeats; that our sailors are a race of men distinguished by their ardour for war, and their intrepidity in danger, from the rest of the human species; that they seem beings superior to fear, and delighted with those objects which cannot be named without filling every other breast with horror; that they are capable of rushing upon apparent destruc|tion without reluctance, and of standing without concern amidst the complicated terrors of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aval war, is universally known and confessed, my lords even by those whose interest it is to doubt or deny it.

<P><Q>There is a very remarkable difference between a standing law and a standing army. A standing law, though it was at first made perpetual, though it should be observed for ages together, yet it cannot say to the legislature, You shall not repeal me; but an army, though it was never designed to be per|petual, though it has been kept up but a small number of years, may say to us, You shall not dis|band me; if you attempt to do so, I will turn you out of doors. We know this by experience; and that experience may convince us that an annual parliamentary check, such as it is pretended we now have, would be of very little signification against an army sufficient, and that army provided with a general resolved, to make the parliament do what|ever he had a mind. <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> and the army under his command, were faithful to that parliament which established them, as long as the parliament did nothing to displease them; but as soon as the parliament began to think of disbanding them, they
<PB N="447" REF="013851_0978_0F9E281FE69D9308">
immediately, and without any garbling, rebelled against the parliament, and at last turned it out of doors. And with a part of the same army, we may remember, that general <HI>Monk</HI> in a few months, and with but very little garbling, dissolv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the rump par|liament, by whose authority he at first pretended to act, and restored king <HI>Ch.</HI> II. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P><Q>The keeping up of a standing mercenary army in a free country, necessarily destroys the martial spirit and decipline of the rest of the people; and all histories shew that a cowardly people must soon become slaves to a foreign or domestic army. The keeping up of such an army in a trading country encourages and promotes a spirit of idleness, lewd|ness, debauchery, luxury, and extravagance among all ranks and degrees of men; and every one knows, that the trade of a country, especially where it has many rivals, can be supported by nothing but by the industry, virtue, sobriety, and frugality of the people. The quartering of soldiers, even in this country, is a terrible grievance and a heavy load upon many private men, and of most dangerous consequence to the freedom of our elections, because it is a rod in the hand of our ministers, which they make use of for correcting any corporation, or county, that shall chuse a member whose face is not agreeable to the court. The providing of a daily support for so many hale, lusty fellows, most of whom have been bred up to some laborious trade or employment, greatly diminishes our profits by trade, and consequently our national revenue, which every one knows, depends upon the labour and industry of our poor. These are disadvantages which are
<PB N="448" REF="013851_0979_0F9E282092F16938">
universally acknowledged; and therefore we ought never to submit to the keeping up a standing merce|nary army, but in cases of the most urgent necessity; nor ought we at any time to keep up a more nume|rous mercenary army than the present necessity evi|dently requires <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P><Q>I need not, I believe, my lords, trace the noble lord in his travels over <HI>Europe,</HI> in order to extinuate the dangers he has endeavoured to pick up, for shewing the necessity we are under at present for keeping up such a numerous army. I think all the dangers he has mentioned, either abroad or at home, depend upon may be's, which must always subsist. A minister may die&mdash;a prince may have ambitious views&mdash;a prince's success may raise the jealousy of others&mdash;his misfortunes may revive their hopes&mdash;there may be a design to invade us, though we have not at present the least item of it&mdash;<HI>Spain</HI> may refuse to do us justice, or may be assisted by the <HI>French,</HI> though we have yet no reason to expect either the one or the other&mdash;A plot for an insurrection may be forming, though we have not at present the least intimation of any such thing, not even from common reports or surmises&mdash;And all these may be's, or possi|bilities, will become probabilities, or certainties, if we should reduce our army. Are these arguments, my lords, that can convince any man in the kingdom of our being under a present necessity for keeping up a numerous standing army in time of peace?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="449" REF="013851_0980_0F9E2824D82BBA98">
<Q>If a parliamentary army (says he <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, V.268.</NOTE>) kept up from year to year becomes an affair of course, I can see no reason for not establishing it by a perpetual law. I wish the bill now before us had been a bill of such a nature. Such a bill would have made people sensible of their danger; whereas by the method we are in, we are like to have a perpetual army palmed upon us, under colour of an annual bill. An army kept up by a perpetual law, would be as much an army kept up by consent of parliament, as an army perpetually kept up by an annual bill. I can see no difference between the one and the other: they are both dangerous, and equally dangerous to our con|stitution; and were thought so by the whole nation, except a few courtiers, in the reign of <HI>Ch.</HI> II. when the custom of keeping up a few regular troops under the denomination of guards, was first introduced. I do not know how the words
<Q>unless with consent of parliament,</Q>
crept into the claim of right; for from the journals of parliament it appears, that the house of commons in <HI>Ch.</HI> II.'s time were of opinion, that the keeping up a standing army in time of peace was inconsistent with our constitution, whether that army was kept up with or without the consent of parliament. In their resolutions there is no such exception; and if the keeping up a standing army in time of peace be wrong, as it must be, if it be incon|sistent with our constitution, I am sure the sanction of parliament, whether by an annual or perpetual law, cannot make it right.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is no argument<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 273.</NOTE>, my lords, to say, we have kept up an army for a great many years without being sensible of any danger. A young fiery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orse

is never brought at&punc; once to submit to the curb, and patiently to receive the rider upon his back. If you put the bit into his mouth without any previous preparation, or put a weak&punc; and unskilful rider upon his back, he will probably break the neck of his rider; but by degrees you may make him tamely submit to both. A free people must be treated in the same manner: by degrees they must be accus|tomed to be governed by an army, by degrees that army must be made strong enough to hold them in subjection. If you should at once attempt to govern your people by a military power, and before they are a little prepared for the yoke; if you should mount your army upon them before it has gathered strength to keep its seat in the saddle, your people would probably break the necks of those that attempted to ride them. But we have already, for many years, been accustoming our people to be governed by an army, under pretence of making use of that army only to assist the civil power; and by degrees we have been for several years increasing the number, and consequently the strength of our army.</Q></P>
<P><Q>To pretend that our liberties <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, V.278.</NOTE> can be in no danger from our army, because it is commanded by gentle|men of the best families and fortunes in the kingdom, is an argument I am surprised to hear made use of. For our liberties ought to depend upon our consti|tution, and not upon the honour of the gentlemen of our army. I can, it is true, depend upon the honour of those who are at present the officers of our army; but my dependence is not founded upon their being gentlemen of family or fortune: It is founded upon their personal characters only. I have the honour
<PB N="451" REF="013851_0982_0F9E2826962C8768">
to be acquainted with many of the chief officers of our army: I know their honour, and the regard they have for the liberties of their country; and upon that knowledge, I can depend. If I were not acquainted with them, I should have but little regard to their being gentlemen of family and fortune: for in all countries where arbitrary power has been established, many gentlemen of the best families and fortunes, have&punc; through fear or ambition, become the tools of ministers, and have assisted or suffered them to sacri|fice the liberties of their country.</Q></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Carteret</HI> afterwards observes <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. LORDS, V.249.</NOTE>,
<Q>That all the nations around, and especially <HI>France,</HI> were cultivat|ing commerce and manufactures. That this made it necessary for <HI>England</HI> to study all possible means for reducing the price of her manufactures, in order to be on an equal foot with her neighbours. That a reduction of the army was one of the most obvious measures for lessening taxes, and reducing manufac|tures.
[How much stronger is that argument now, when we have more than doubled the national debt!] So far, says he, have we been from being frugal; and saving upon this article, or indeed, any other article of public expence, that we have for many years kept up a more numerous standing army than was in my opinion necessary; and upon most of the other articles we are every year increasing, instead of diminishing. Our civil list revenue has been increased from 4 or 500,000<HI>l.</HI> to, I may say, near a million a year. The expence of our army at home has been of late years increased: the expence of our land forces in the plantations, <HI>Minorca,</HI> and <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> has been
<PB N="452" REF="013851_0983_0F9E282753CC0DE0">
increasing for several years, and is this year higher than it was the last: The expence of <HI>Chelsea</HI> hospital is every year increasing; and as we are almost every year creating some new post, or adding some new officer to the management and collection of our pub|lic revenue, this, I believe, is a hidden and dangerous sort of expence, which has been vastly increased of late years, and is every year increasing. Many smalls, my lords, make a great, as we may see by comparing our present annual revenue with what it was forty or fifty years ago. Before the revolution, the whole of the public expence, which the people of this nation were annually lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded with, was but about two mil|lions. Now what we call the current expence, which the parliament provides for every year, amounts to above two millions besides the civil list, the in|terest growing due every year to our public creditors, and the sinking fund, which are provided for by esta|blished, perpetual revenues; and as the civil list re|venue may be computed at near one million, the interest growing due upon our public funds at near two millions, and the sinking fund at above one mil|lion yearly, we must reckon that the people of this nation are now, even in time of peace, loaded with a public expence of six millions, instead of the two millions, which was the highest sum they were ever loaded with in time of peace, before the late happy revolution.</Q></P>

If the greatness of a state is to be measured by the number of its troops, the elector of <HI>Hanover</HI> is as great as the king of <HI>England.</HI> But a very different estimation ought to be made of our greatness; the strength of <HI>England</HI> is its wealth and its trade: Take care of them, you will be always formidable: lose them, you are nothing; you are the last of mankind. Were there no other reasons for reducing the army, it should be done upon the principle of oeconomy alone. It is a melancholy thought to reflect how much we have spent, and to how little purpose for these 16 years past. Sir, could it be said,

<P>Mr. <HI>Shippen, A. D.</HI> 1739, spoke on this subject as follows <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. X.407.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q>Can it be thought, that our influence at foreign courts depends upon the number of land-forces we keep in continual pay? Nor, Sir; our influence de|pends upon the riches and number of our people, and not upon the number of our regular regiments, or the appearance they make at a review. We have many thousands that would make as good an appear|ance in the day of battle if their country were in danger, though they are not at present masters of all the punctilios proper only for a review. We have a navy, which no nation in the world can equal, far less overcome, by which we may carry the dread of this nation into every country that is visited by the occean: And we have money, notwithstanding the bad use we have made of so long a peace, to hire as as many foreign troops as we can have occasion for, and to support them as long as we can have any service for them. Therefore, while we are unanimous amongst ourselves, while our government possesses the hearts and affections of the people in general,
<PB N="455" REF="013851_0986_0F9E2DD1CADF66C8">
which every virtuous and wise government must neces|sarily do, this nation must always have a great in|fluence upon the counsels of every court in <HI>Europe,</HI> nay of every court in the world, where it is necessary for us to extend our influence. From hence we may see, Sir, that in this nation we can never have occa|sion for keeping up a great number or any number of regular troops in order to give weight to any ne|gotiations; and if any power in <HI>Europe</HI> should refuse to observe or perform the treaties they have made with us, we ought not to seek redress by negotiation. We may make a demand; but it is beneath the dignity of a powerful people to sue for justice. Upon the first refusal or affected delay, we ought to compel them, not by keeping an army at home, which would be ridiculous, but by sending an irresistible fleet, with an army on board to ravage their coasts; or by getting some of their neighbours, with our assistance, to attack them; both which will always be in the power of every goverment of this country, that preserve their influence abroad by preserving the affections of the people at home; and that without keeping any number of regular troops always in pay; for whilst the spirit of liberty, which is the nursing mother of courage, is preserved among our people, we shall never want a great number of brave men of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l degree amongst us, that will be ready to venture their lives in the cause of their country; and such men may in a few weeks be sufficiently disci|plined for action, though they might not perhaps observe all the punctilios so exactly as a parcel of idle mercenary fellows, who have had perhaps nothing to do for seve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> years together, but to dance through their exercises. The keeping up of a stand|ing army in this nation, can never therefore be
<PB N="456" REF="013851_0987_0F9E2DD28EFF14B0">
necessary, either for preserving our influence amongst our neighbours, or for punishing such of them as shall-offend us; and with respect to our own defence, as we have no frontier but the ocean, while we preserve a superiority at sea, a popular government in this country can never be under the least necessity of keeping up any land forces, especially if they would take care to have our militia but tolerably armed and disciplined; for no nation will be mad enough to invade us, while we are united among ourselves, with a handful of troops, who must either all die by the sword, or be made prisoners of war; because we could by means of our navy prevent their being able to return. And if any of our neighbours should prepare to invade us with a great fleet and a numerous army, we should not only have time to prepare for their reception, but we might lock them up in their ports by means of our navy, or we might give them enough to do at home by stirring up some of their neigbours upon the continent to invade them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In consequence of our attachment to continental mea|sures,
armies (says lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI>) grew so much into fashion, in time of war, among men who meant well to their country, that they who mean ill keep them still up in the profoundest peace; and the number of our soldiers in this island alone is almost double to that of our seamen. That they are kept up against foreign enemies, cannot be said with any colour. If they are kept for shew, they are ridiculous. If they are kept for any other purpose whatever, they are too dangerous to be suffered. A patriot king, se|conded by ministers attached to the true interest of their country, would soon reform this abuse, and save a great part of this expence; or apply it in a

<P><Q>Our method of trying delinquents, (says lord <HI>Car|teret</HI>) either in the land or sea service, by a court-martial composed of their respective officers, has been judged liable to many objections, and has occasioned no little discontent in the nation. For as their en|quiry is restricted to a particular set of articles in each service, I do not see how a commanding officer, vested with a discretionary power of acting, can strictly or properly come under their cognizance, or ever be liable to their censure, unless he is proved guilty of a direct breach of any one of those articles. But as a com|mander in chief may easily avoid any offence of that nature, and yet upon the whole of his conduct in any expedition, be highly culpable; a court-martial thus circumscribed in their power of enquiry, can never be competent judges in a cause where they are denied a proper power of examining into the

As therefore in|struction is the true end and use of all hist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, I shall take the liberty of offering a scheme drawn from that wise and salutary institution of the <HI>Cartha|ginians,</HI> which is, That a select standing com|mittee be appointed, to be composed of an equal number of members of both houses, chosen annually by balloting, with a full power of inquiring into the conduct of all commanders in chief without any re|straint of articles of war; and that after a proper examination the committee shall refer the case with their opinion upon it to the decision of his majesty. This scheme seems to me the least liable to objections of any I have yet met with. For if the members are chosen by ballot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, they will be less liable to the influence of party. If they are chosen annually, and refer the case to the decision of the crown, which is the fountain of justice as well as mercy, they will neither incroach upon the royal prerogative, nor be liable to that signal defect in the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> committee, which sat for life, and whose sentence was final without appeal.</Q></P>

I hope this house will always have penetration enough not to pass a law which is in itself oppres|sive, or at least the goodness to repeal it, as soon as it appears to be so; and I hope we shall always have virtue and courage enough to send that magi|strate or that officer to <HI>Tyburn,</HI> who shall dare to make an oppressive use of any law we give our con|sent to. Therefore if there be any laws now in being, which cannot be executed by the civil power, we ought to enquire into them, and the use that is made of them, in order to amend or repeal them; and to contrive some other methods or laws for an|swering those ends, for which they were intended. Surely we are not to make a sacrifice of our consti|tution and liberties, by establishing a military go|vernment for the support of oppressive or dangerous laws, which through inadvertency or want of fore|sight have been agreed to, either by ourselves or our ancestors. But suppose, my lords, that the mobs and tumults which have lately happened, and the
<PB N="460" REF="013851_0991_0F9E2DD84363FF08">
opposition that has in some cases been made to the civil magistrate, have proceeded from nothing of an oppressive nature in any of our laws, nor from the oppressive use that has been made of any of them, which I hope is the case; yet experience has taught us that regular troops are far from being proper or effectual instruments, for preventing such tumults, or for aiding the civil magistrate in the execution of our laws. The late atrocious murder committed by the mob at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was perpetrated within a few hundred yards of a whole regiment of regular troops; and even here in <HI>Westminster,</HI> nay even within the verge of the court, we know that great affronts have been offered to the government, and some murders committed by mobs within the view of our regular troops. It is impossible, my lords, to make our re|gular troops proper or effectual instruments for quelling mobs, or for enforcing the laws of their country, unless you lodge the civil as well as military power in the officers of your army; and such a regulation, I am sure, no lord of this house would agree to, nor would any officer of our army, I hope, desire to see it established.</Q></P>
<P>The following is part of one of the parliamentary speeches for a place-bill. In separating it from the rest, I have cut off the name of the speaker. It is much to the purpose on this subject.</P>
<P><Q>The keeping up of a standing army in this island in time of peace, was always, till the revolution, deemed inconsistent with our constitution. Since that time indeed, we have always thought the keep|ing up of a <HI>small</HI> number [not 50,000; for that is in my humble opinion a <HI>great</HI> number]
of regular troops is necessary for preserving our constitution, or at least the present establishment. How far this
<PB N="461" REF="013851_0992_0F9E2DD9899FCA78">
may be right, I shall not pretend to determine. But I must observe, that the famous scheme for overturn|ing our constitution, which was published in the year 1629, required but 3,000 foot for this purpose; and if <HI>Charles</HI> I. had, in the year 1641, been provided with such a number of regular troops upon whom he might have depended for overawing the mob of the city of <HI>London,</HI> his fate, I believe, would have been very different from what it was. I am very far from thinking that such a very small number, even now that our people are so much difused to arms, would be sufficient for overturning our constitution; but there is a certain number which would be infallibly sufficient for this purpose, and it is not easy to deter|mine how near we may now be come to that num|ber. Now suppose, we are come within 2 or 3,000 of that number, and that a minister, in order to ren|der his success against our constitution infallible, should, upon some specious pretence or other, desire the parliament to consent to an augmentation of 2 or 3,000 men to our army; can we suppose that such a small augmentation upon a plausible pretence, would be refused by a parliament chiefly composed of officers and placemen? Can we suppose that any man would risk his losing a lucrative employment, by voting against such a small augmentation? Some civil powers to be executed by civil officers, and some military powers to be executed by a standing army or a standing militia, are certainly necessary in all go|vernments: I am afraid it is impossible to preserve a free government, when all those powers are lodged in one single man; but when they are not only lodged in one single man, but greatly increased be|yond what is necessary for the support of a free go|vernment, I am sure the freedom of that government
<PB N="462" REF="013851_0993_0F9E2DDA1A9B5EF0">
must be soon at an end; and it is very hard to dis|tinguish between the powers necessary for the support of a free government, and these that are sufficient for establishing an arbitrary one. The partition is so thin, that it may easily be mistaken, and certainly will be mistaken by most of those who are under a temptation to judge partially in favour of arbitrary power.</Q></P>
<P>Part of Sir <HI>Charles Sedley</HI>'s speech in parliament on the bill for disbanding the army, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1699 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. III.190.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q>I hope my behaviour in this house has put me above the censure of one who would obstruct his majesty's affairs. I was as early in the apprehensions of the power of <HI>France</HI> as any man. I never stuck at money for fleets, armies, alliances, or whatever expences seemed to have the preservation of our new settled government for their end. I am still of the same mind; but that was war, and this is peace; and if I differ from some worthy gentlemen who have spoke before me, they will be so just as to be|lieve it is not about the end, but the means, that we contend. Some may think <HI>England</HI> cannot be safe without a standing army of 30,000 men; and will tell us the king of <HI>France</HI> has 200,000 in pay disciplined troops; that all our neighbours are armed in another manner than they were wont to be; that we must not imagine we can defend ourselves with our ordinary and legal forces. All this is very ma|terial, and would have great weight with me if <HI>England</HI> were not an island accessible only by sea, and in that case not till the invaders have destroyed our navy, which is or may be made superior to any force that can be brought against us. It is very difficult to land forces in an enemy's country; the
<PB N="463" REF="013851_0994_0F9E2DDAF4683AB0">
<HI>Spanish</HI> armada was beaten at sea, and never set foot on <HI>English</HI> ground; his present majesty with all the shipping of <HI>Holland</HI> could bring over but 14,000, or 15,000 men, and that so publickly, that nothing but an infatuated prince would have permitted their landing. Our attempt upon <HI>Brest</HI> shews us that it is easy with a small force to prevent an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssault from the other side of the water. As we are capable of being attacked in several places, so it may be urged as reason for several troops more than our finances can bear; but if we burden the people thus far in peace, it may tempt some to wish for war again; every change carrying a prospect of better times, and nothing can make worse times than a standing army of any number of men will at present. If we are true to ourselves, 10,000 men are enough; and if not, 100,000 are too few.</Q></P>
<P>If we had improved the militia, we might have had at this time 5000,000 men tolerably disciplined. This would have put the power into the hands of the peo|ple, where only it can be safe.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hutcheson,</HI> in his speech on the forces for 1718 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. VI. Append. p. 46.</NOTE>, observes,
<Q>That no legislator ever founded a free government, but he avoided this <HI>Charybdis</HI>
[of a mercenary army] as a rock against which his com|monwealth must certainly be shipwrecked, as the <HI>Israelites, Athenians, Corinthians, Achaians, Lacedaemo|nians, Thebans, Samnites</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI>;</Q> none of which nations, whilst they kept their liberty, were ever known to maintain any soldiers in constant pay, within their cities, or ever suffered any of their subjects to make war their profession; well knowing that the sword and sovereignty always march hand

in hand; and therefore they trained their own citizens and inhabitants of their territories about them, per|petually in arms; and their whole common wealths, by this means, became so many formed militias. A general exercise of the best of their people in the use of arms, was the only bulwark of their liberties. This was reckoned the surest way to preserve them both at home and abroad, the people being secured thereby as well against the domestic affronts of any of their own citizens, as against the foreign invasions of ambitious and unruly neighbours. Their arms were never lodged in the hands of any, who had not interest in preserving the public peace, who fought <HI>pro aris et focis,</HI> and thought themselves sufficiently paid by repelling invaders, that they might with freedom return to their own affairs. In those days there was no difference between the citizen, the soldier, and the husbandman; for all promiscuously took arms when the public safety required it, and afterwards laid them down with more alacrity than they took them up. So that we find among the <HI>Romans,</HI> the best and bravest of their generals came from the plough, contentedly returning when the work was over, and never demanding their triumphs 'till they laid down their commands, and reduced themselves to the state of private men. Nor do we find this famous common wealth ever permitted a deposition of their arms in any other hands, 'till their empire increasing, necessity constrained them to erect a constant stipendiary soldiery abroad in fo|reign parts, either for the holding or winning of provinces. Then luxury increasing with dominion, the strict rule and dicipline of freedom soon abated, and forces were kept up at home; which soon proved of such dangerous consequence, that the people were
<PB N="465" REF="013851_0996_0F9E2DDC804B7850">
forced to make a law to employ them at a conveni|ent distance; which was, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any general marched over the river <HI>Rubicon,</HI> he should be declared a public enemy. See above page 441.</P>
<P>Though we should admit, that an army might be consistent with freedom in a commonwealth, yet it is otherwise in a free monarchy; for in the former, 'tis wholly at the disposal of the people, who nominate, appoint, discard, and punish the generals and officers as they think fit, and 'tis certain death to make any attempt upon their liberties; whereas in the latter, the king is perpetual general, may model the army as he pleases, and it will be called high treason to oppose him. This subject is so self evident, that I am almost ashamed to undertake the proof of it. For if we look through the world, we shall find in no country, liberty and an army stand together; so that to know whether a people are free or slaves, it is necessary only to ask, Whether there is an army kept up amongst them? This truth is so obvious, that the most barefaced advocates for an army do not directly deny it, but qualify the matter by telling us that a number not exceeding twenty or thirty thou|sand are a handful to so populous a nation as this. Now I think that number may bring as certain ruin upon us, as if they were as many millions; and I will give my reasons for it. It is the misfortune of all countries, that they sometimes lie under an un|happy necessity to defend themselves by arms against the ambition of their governors, and to fight for what is their own; for if a prince will rule us with a rod of iron, and invade our laws and liberties, and neither be prevailed upon by our miseries, sup|plications, nor tears, we have no power upon earth
<PB N="466" REF="013851_0997_0F9E2DDD16312ED0">
to appeal to, and therefore must patiently submit to our bondage, or stand upon our own defence; which if we are enabled to do, we shall never be put upon it, but our swords may grow rusty in our hands; for that nation is surest to live in peace, that is most capable of making war; and a man that hath a sword by his side, shall have least occasion to make use of it. Now I say, if a king hath thirty thousand men beforehand with his subjects, the people can make no effort to defend their liberties without the assist|ance of a foreign power, which is a remedy most commonly as bad as the disease; and if we have not a power within ourselves to defend our laws, we are no government. For <HI>England</HI> being a small country, few strong towns in it, and these in the king's hands, the nobility disarmed by the destruction of tenures, and militia not to be raised but by the king's com|mand, there can be no force levied in any part of <HI>England,</HI> but must be destroyed in its infancy by a few regiments; for what will twenty or thirty thousand naked unarmed men signify against as many troops of mercenary soldiers. What if they should come into the field, and say,
<Q>You must chuse these and these men your representatives?</Q>
<Q>Where is your choice? What if they should say, "Parliaments are seditious and factious assemblies, and therefore ought to be abolished? What is become of your freedom? If they should encompass this house and threaten, if the members do not sur|render up their government they will put them to the sword; What is become of your constitution? These things may be done under a tyrannical prince, and have been done in several parts of the world. What is it that causeth the tyranny of the <HI>Turks</HI> at

this day, but servants in arms? What is it that preserved the glorious commonwealth of <HI>Rome,</HI> but swords in the hands of its citizens? I will add here, that most nations were enslaved by small armies. <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> left behind him but twenty-seven thousand men; and the duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> who was the darling of the people, was suppressed with two thousand; nay, <HI>Caesar</HI> seized <HI>Rome</HI> itself with five thousand, and fought the battle of <HI>Pharsalia,</HI> where the fate of the world was decided, with twenty two thousand. And most of the revolutions of the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Ottoman</HI> empires since, were caused by the pretorian bands, and the court janizaries; the for|mer of which never exceeded eight, nor the latter twelve thousand men. And if no greater numbers could make such disturbances in these vast empires, what will double or treble the force do with us? And they themselves confess it when they argue for an army; for they tell us we may be surprized with ten or fifteen thousand men from <HI>France,</HI> and having no regular force to oppose them, they will over<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">un the kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>The fear of an invasion is no argument for an <HI>army</HI>; because a sufficient <HI>fleet</HI> to intercept invaders in their return, with a sufficient <HI>militia</HI> to give them a proper reception upon their arrival, is prefe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able to an army, which must be scattered in different pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts of the kingdom, and could not be brought toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her to resist the invaders before they had done a great deal of mischief.</P>
<P>It was observed by Mr. <HI>Pulteney</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. VII.38.</NOTE> in the house of commons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1729, in a debate on the number of forces for that year,
<Q>that one fundamental argu|ment
<PB N="468" REF="013851_0999_0F9E2DE177DA0110">
for the establishment of our liberties in the Bill of Rights is, that the keeping up a standing army in time of peace is contrary to law; that accordingly, after the peace of <HI>Ryswick,</HI> the greatest part of the army was disbanded; and, though upon the just fear of a new war, the parliament complimented king <HI>William</HI> with an establishment of 10,000 men, yet the same was not obtained without opposition; many honest and sober men among the warmest sticklers for the revolution, looking upon it as an encroach|ment on our liberties, and being justly apprehensive it would prove a dangerous precedent: that during the late war our land forces, together with those in our pay, amounted to above 200,000 men, the load of which still lies heavy upon us; but after the peace of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> there was a general reduction, except about 12,000 men; that upon the late king's acces|sion, when the rebellion broke out in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> the army was indeed augmented with se|veral regiments, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> other additional troops, but these were again reduced not long after; that in the year 1727, upon the prospect of the great dangers that were apprehended from the treaty of <HI>Vienna,</HI> an augmentation of about 8000 men was moved for in this house, but the same was warmly opposed; nor was it granted, but upon assurance that this expence should cease, as soon as the extraordinary occasion that called for it was over: that the event has shewn that most of those apprehensions were grundless and chimerical.</Q></P>
<P>On the superior importance of the navy to the army, M. <HI>Potter</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. IV.268.</NOTE> spoke excellently in the house of com|mons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1751, as follows;</P>
<P><PB N="469" REF="013851_1000_0F9E2DE18E6FE470"><Q>I am really astonished, Sir, when I consider how inconsistent some gentlemen are, when they argue for a number of <HI>land</HI> forces to be kept in the pay of the public in time of peace, and when they argue for a number of <HI>seamen</HI> to be kept in the pay of the pub|lic. When the question before us is about the num|ber of land forces to be kept up in time of peace, they never once think of the vast number of brave landmen we have, and I hope always shall have in this island: These are with them, upon that occasion, of no account with regard to the strength or power of the nation, which they then say consists only in the number of men we have in actual pay, and sub|ject to the slavish rules of military law; and when any one proposes a diminution of the number, they exclaim, What, will you weaken the hands of go|vernment? Will you dismiss those men upon whom alone you can depend for your protection? But when the question comes about the number of seamen to be kept in public pay, they then tell you that the maritime power, or strength of this nation, does not depend upon the number of seamen you have in the actual pay of the public, but upon the numbers that belong to the wide extended <HI>British</HI> dominions, though many of them are at all times dispersed over the whole face of the globe.

From this way of arguing, Sir, would not an ignorant stranger conclude that the go|vernment has no power over the land men of this island, even in the case of an invasion, or that a man might learn to be a complete sailor in a few days, but could not learn to be a complete soldier in a few years? One of these conclusions an ignorant stranger
<PB N="470" REF="013851_1001_0F9E2DE266767B38">

Whereas the most ignorant land man may learn all the business of a common soldier in a few days: I mean all the fighting business; for as to all the punctilios of a review, I shall grant, it may require some months before he can go through them with dexterity.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Sandys</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. XII.127.</NOTE>, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1740, spoke as follows on the inconveniencies to which the subjects are reduced by quartering soldiers.</P>
<P><Q>Sir, It is an unfortunate state we are fallen into, that every session of parliament must be attended with new laws, or new clauses in old laws, for op|pressing the industrious subject, and endangering the liberties of the country. It is impossible to levy high duties upon the necessaries or conveniencies of life; it is impossible to keep up numerous standing armies without such laws, or such clauses, and yet we have, for twenty years, been contriving how to continue and increase both. The high duties we groan under were introduced for supporting a heavy and expensive, but necessary, war; but how the keeping up of a numerous standing army in time of peace was introduced, I can no other way account
<PB N="471" REF="013851_1002_0F9E2DE3E0F0D4B0">
for, than by supposing, that it was necessary for sup|porting unpopular destructive measures, and a hated minister. I am surprised to hear the forcible quar|tering of soldiers upon public or private houses insisted on, as if it wear a necessary means for the support of our goverment. Sir, if we were to attend strictly to our constitution, even as it stands at present, we ought in no mutiny bill to admit of the quartering of soldiers, even on public houses, except for a few nights in their march from one garrison to another, or for the first night after they arrive at the place designed for their residence. Though we now keep up, though we have long kept up, a great number of standing forces in time of peace, yet, properly speaking, they are no more than is supposed to be necessary for guards and garrisons; and accordingly, the resolution annually agreed to in this house is, That the number of effective men to be provided for guards and garrisons in <HI>Great Britain</HI> for the ensuing year, shall be such a num|ber as is then thought necessary. Before the revo|lution we had guards and garrisons, even in time of peace. But before the revolution, and some years after, we had no quartering of soldiers, either upon public or private houses, in time of peace, without the consent of the owner. On the contrary, by an express law, the latter end of <HI>Ch.</HI> IId's reign, it was enacted, That no officer, military or civil, or other person, shall quarter or billet any soldier upon any inhabitant of this realm without his consent; which law stood in force till near the end of the year 1692, when the first law was made for quartering sol|diers in public houses. Before that year, Sir, our guards and garrisons, by which, I mean, all the soldiers we had on foot, even in their marching
<PB N="472" REF="013851_1003_0F9E2DE4CE236280">
from one place to another, were obliged to quarter themselves, as other travellers do, in houses that were willing to receive them; and when they came to any garrison, or place where they were to reside, every officer and soldier provided quarters for him|self, in which, I believe, there was no inconveni|ence found; for when soldiers behave civilly and are agreeable to the people, there will always be houses enough, either public or private, that will be glad to receive them for what they are able to pay, unless there be a greater number of them than the place can conveniently accomodate. From the revolution to the year 1692, we had a sort of civil war amongst ourselves; for <HI>Ireland</HI> was not entirely reduced till the end of the year 1691, and as <HI>inter arma silent leges,</HI> perhaps, during that time some liberties were taken with the laws in respect to quar|tering or billeting of soldiers. But in the year 1692, the domestic tranquillity of the three kingdoms being re-established, the parliament began to think of restoring the laws to their pristine force. However, as we were then engaged in a dangerous foreign war, and upon that account obliged to keep a greater number of troops than usual; and as our troops were often obliged to march in great bodies either from one place of the kingdom to another, as danger threatened, or through the kingdom in their way to <HI>Flanders,</HI> the parliament saw it would be necessary to provide quarters for them upon their march in a different manner from what had been allowed by law; and therefore, in the mutiny-bill for the en|suing year, which then first begun to be entitled, A bill for punishing officers and soldiers who shall mutiny or desert their majesties service, and for punishing false musters, and for the payment of
<PB N="473" REF="013851_1004_0F9E2DE5D16450F8">
quarters," the clause for quartering soldiers in public houses, without consent of the owner, was intro|duced, and has ever since remained in all the mutiny bills passed to this day; for a favourite power once granted to the crown is seldom recovered by the subject without some remarkable revolution in our government.</Q></P>
<P>The transaction which, in the year 1741, occasioned the following reprimand, shews, in a very striking light, the evil of a standing army, and one of the bad uses it may be put to.</P>
<P><Q>Mr. <HI>Blackerby,</HI> M. <HI>Howard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lediard!</HI> You having at the bar of this house yesterday confessed, that you did send for and cause to come, on <HI>Friday</HI> the eighth day of <HI>May</HI> last, a body of armed soldiers, headed by officers in a military manner, who did take possession of the church yard of <HI>St. Paul, Covent Garden,</HI> near the place where the poll for the election of citizens to serve in this present parliament for the city of <HI>Westminster,</HI> was taken, before the said election was ended; and you having acknowledged your offence therein, the house did order you to attend this morning, to be brought to the bar to be reprimanded on your knees by me for the said offence. I cannot better describe to you the nature of this offence you have been guilty of than in the words of the resolution this house came to upon their examina|tion into that matter, which are; That the presence of a regular body of armed soldiers at an election of mem|bers to serve in parliament is an high infringment of the liberties of the subject, a manifest violation of the freedom of elections, and an open defiance of the laws and constitution of this kingdom. And it is impos|sible, if you will consider the terms of this resolution,
<PB N="474" REF="013851_1005_0F9E2DE641AA1DF0">
but that you must have in your breast the deepest sorrow and remorse for this rash act of yours, which, if it had not been duly animadverted upon, might have given the most dangerous wound to the consti|tution of this free country that perhaps it ever had felt.&mdash;This country is free, because this house is so; which this house can never be, but from the freedom of election to it: And amidst the too many ways for violating that, none can be more pernicious, because none more quick, decisive, and parmanent, than what you might unhappily have set a precedent for, and which might have grown to an extremity under the specious and ready pretences of fears and necessity that supersede all law; a precedent that would have received an authority from the place it began in, the seat of the government and legislature of this kingdom. Necessity, which is to take place of law, must be lest to the circumstances of every particular case. The act must be presumed to be wrong, enquired into as such, and excused only by the clearest proofs, that the necessity for it was real. What you have done is against one of the most essential parts of the law of the kingdom. Has any real necessity been shewn for it? There might be fears; there might be some danger: but did you try the strength of the law to dispel those fears, and remove that danger? Did you make use of those powers the law has invested you with as civil magistrates for the preservation of the public peace? No: You deserted all that; and wantonly, I hope inadvertently, re|sorted to that force the most unnatural of all others, in all respects, to that cause and business you were then attending, and for the freedom of which every <HI>Briton</HI> ought to be ready almost to suffer any thing.

others I have treated of. What I have published will shew plainly, that the ablest men, and best citizens of this realm, have looked upon a mercenary army in times of peace, whether allowed from year to year, or established for perpetuity, as a dangerous and alarming abuse in a free country. They opposed it strenuously in treatises, pamphlets, and speeches. And we let it pass annually without question or dispute. Whe|ther the fears of our ancestors, or our indifference, are most reasonable, time will shew. By the aspect of the present times, it is not improbable, that the point may very soon be decided.</P>

<HEAD>A SPECIMEN CIVIL SOCIETY. Different FORMS OF GOVERNMENT compared.</HEAD>
<P>THE finest countries have been depopulated by despotism; witness Greece, Egypt, and the lesser Asia. The river Menam, in the kingdom of Siam, overflows annually like the Nile, de|positing a quantity of slime, which proves a rich ma|nure. The river seems to rise gradually as the rice grows; and retires to its channel when the rice, ap|proaching to maturity, needs no longer to be watered. Nature beside has bestowed on that rich country va|riety of delicious fruits, requiring scarce any culture. In such a paradise, would one imagine that the Siamite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are a miserable people? The government is despo|tic, and the subjects are slaves: they must work for their monarch six months every year, without wages, and even without receiving any food from him. What renders them still more miserable is, that they have no protection either for their persons or their goods: the grandees are exposed to the rapacity of the king and his courtiers; and the lower ranks are exposed to the rapacity of the grandees. When a man has the misfortune to possess a tree re|markable for good fruit, he is required in the name of the King, or of a courtier, to preserve the fruit for their use. Every proprietor of a garden in the neighbourhood of the capital must pay a yearly sum to the keeper of the elephants; otherwise it will be laid waste by these animals, whom it is high treason to molest. From the sea-port of Mergui to the ca|pital, one travels ten or twelve days through immense plains of a rich soil, finely watered. That country appears to have been formerly cultivated, but is now
<PB REF="013851_1011_0F9E2DED8EF42000">
quite depopulated, and left to tigers and elephants. Formerly, an immense commerce was carried on in that fertile country: historians attest, that in the middle of the sixteenth century above a thousand foreign ships frequented its ports annually. But the King, tempted with so much riches, endea|voured to engross all the commerce of his country; by which means he annihilated suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">essivly mines, manufactures, and even agriculture. The country is depopulated, and few remain there but beggars. A despotic government stifles, in the birth, all the bounties of nature, and renders the finest spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the globe equally sterile with its barren mountains.</P>
<P>I have insisted longer upon the deplorable effects of despotism than perhaps is necessary; but I was fond of the opportunity to justify, or rather applaud the spirit of liberty so eminent in the inhabitants of Britain. I now proceed to compare different forms of government, with respect to various particu|lars; beginning with patriotism. Every form of government must be good that inspires patriotism; and the best form to invigorate that noble passion is a common wealth founded on rotation of power, where it is the study of those in office to do good, and to merit approbation from their fellow citizens.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Importance of Manners in a State.</HEAD>
<P>THIS work professes itself to be an inquiry into public errors, deficiencies, and abuses. And surely there is no grosser error, no deficiency more fatal, no abuse more shameful, than a nation's losing the proper delicacy of sentiment with regard to right and wrong, and deviating into a general cor|ruption of manners. Has ambition raised a tyrant, a <HI>Caesar,</HI> or a <HI>Charles,</HI> to despotic power? The sword of a <HI>Brutus,</HI> or the axe in the hand of the man in the mask, in a moment sets the people free. Has an aristocracy of thirty tyrants, as at <HI>Athens,</HI> seized the liberties of a country? A bold <HI>Thrasybulus</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Corn. Nep.</HI> VIT. THRASYS&punc;</NOTE> may be found, who coming upon them in their secure hour, shall, by means perhaps seemingly very inadequate,
<PB N="2" REF="013851_1026_0F9E2DFF96FC7DB0">
blast all their schemes, and overthrow the edifice of of tyranny they had set up, burying them in its ruins. The people thus set free, if the spirit of liberty be not extinct among them, and their manners generally corrupt, will preserve their recovered liberties. If their manners be so universally debauched, as to ren|der them uncapable of liberty, they will, as the de|generate <HI>Romans,</HI> upon the fall of <HI>Iulius,</HI> set up an <HI>Augustus</HI> in his place. It is impossible to pronounce with certainty concerning any country, as the angel did of the devoted cities, that the decline of manners in it is universal and irretrievable. But where that is the case, the ruin of that country is unavoidable, the disease is incurable. For vice prevailing would destroy not only a kingdom, or an empire, but the whole moral dominion of the Almighty throughout the in|finitude of space.</P>
<P>The excellent <HI>Montesquieu</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Montesq.</HI> II.119.</NOTE> teaches the necessity of manners, in order to gain the effect proposed by laws; and brings several instances where the manners defeated the purpose of laws. Nothing, he says, could appear to the <HI>Germans</HI> more unsupportable than <HI>Varus</HI>'s tribunal. They cut out the tongues of the advocates, who pleaded at the bar, with these sarcastic words, as related by <HI>Tacitus,</HI>
<Q>Viper! give over his|sing.</Q>
The trial ordered by the emperor <HI>Iustinian,</HI> on occasion of the murder of the king of the <HI>Lazians,</HI> ap|peared to that people a horrible and barbarous thing. <HI>Mithridates,</HI> king of <HI>Pontus,</HI> haranguing against the <HI>Romans,</HI> reproaches them, above all things, with the formalities of their courts of justice. The <HI>Parthians</HI> could not endure a king, set over them by the <HI>Romans,</HI> because, having been educated in a commonwealth, he
<PB N="3" REF="013851_1027_0F9E2E004E5C48E8">
was free and affable. Even liberty and virtue to an enslaved and vicious people, become odious and insup|portable, as a pure air is disagreeable to those who have lived in a marshy country. No people ever lost the spirit of liberty but through the fault of their government.</P>
<P>Liberty cannot be preserved, if the manners of the people are corrupted; nor absolute monarchy intro|duced, where they are sincere, says <HI>Sidney</HI> ON GO|VERNMENT.</P>
<P>When <HI>Antigonus,</HI> and the <HI>Achaians,</HI> restored li|berty to the <HI>Spartans,</HI> they could not keep it; the spirit of liberty was gone.</P>
<P>When <HI>Thrasybulus</HI> delivered <HI>Athens</HI> from the thirty tyrants, liberty came too late; the manners of the <HI>Athenians</HI> were then too far gone into licentiousness, avarice, and debauchery. There is a time, when a people are no longer worth saving.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Tarquins</HI> were expelled, <HI>Rome</HI> recovered her liberty. When <HI>Iulius</HI> was stabbed, <HI>Rome</HI> conti|nued in slavery. What occasioned such different con|sequences from the same measure in this same country at different periods? In the times of the <HI>Tarquins, Rome</HI> was incorrupt; in those of <HI>Caesar,</HI> debauched. Even in the dictator's times, a few more <HI>Catos</HI> and <HI>Brutuses</HI> would have restored liberty. For the people are always interested against tyranny, if they can but be properly headed. Half the firmness the <HI>Dutch</HI> shewed against the <HI>Spanish</HI> tyranny, would emancipate <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Romans</HI> were defeated by <HI>Hannibal,</HI> most of their allies forsook them. But <HI>Hiero</HI> king of <HI>Sicily</HI> saw that the constitution of the republic was still sound, and rightly concluded, that she would recover. He would not have thought so in the times of <HI>Lucullus,</HI> of
<PB N="4" REF="013851_1028_0F9E2E0113D7CDB0">
<HI>Cinna, Sylla,</HI> &amp;c. when corruption was wasting all like a pestilence.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Il ne faut pas beaucoup de probite, &amp;c.</HI> Great pro|bity is not essentially necessary for the support of a monarchy, or despotic government. The force of laws in the former, in the latter the arm of the prince lifted up, commands all. In a popular government, another engine is necessary, viz. virtue; because no|thing else will keep up the execution of the laws, and the practice of what is right <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Montesq.</HI> I.31.</NOTE>.</Q>
This sentiment is oracular. And what then is the prospect we have before us?</P>
<P>Where the manners of a people are gone, laws are of no avail. They will refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e them, or they will ne|glect them. There are in our times more of the laws ineffectual, than those that operate. And on every occasion of misbehaviour, we hear people cry, there ought to be such or such a <HI>law</HI> made; whereas, upon inquiry, it is perhaps found that there are already se|veral unexceptionable laws upon the head standing; but, through want of manners, a mere dead letter.</P>
<P><Q>If all parts of the state do not with their utmost power promote the public good; if the prince has other aims than the safety and welfare of his coun|try; if such as represent the people do not preserve their courage and integrity; if the nation's treasure is wasted; if ministers are allowed to undermine the constitution with impunity; if judges are suffered to pervert justice and wrest the law; then is a mixed government the greatest tyranny in the world: it is tyranny established by a law; it is authorised by con|sent, and such a people are bound with fetters of
<PB N="5" REF="013851_1029_0F9E2E01F12442E0">
their own making. A tyranny that governs by the sword, has few friends but men of the sword; but a legal tyranny, (where the people are only called to confirm iniquity with their own voices) has on its side the rich, the timid, the lazy, those that know the law, and get by it, ambitious churchmen, and all those whose livelihood depends upon the quiet posture of affairs: and the persons here described compose the influencing part of most nations; so that such a tyranny is hardly to be shaken off. Men may be said to be enslaved by law or their own consent under corrupt or degenerate republics, such as was the <HI>Roman</HI> commonwealth from the time of <HI>Cinna</HI> till the attempts of <HI>Caesar</HI>; and under degenerate mixed governments, such as <HI>Rome</HI> was, while the emperors made a show of ruling by law, but with an influenced and corrupted senate, to which form of government <HI>England</HI> was almost reduced, till the King came over to put our liberties upon a better foot <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Daven.</HI> II.300.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">DE REPUBL. IV. <HI>in fine.</HI></NOTE> calls virtue the health of the mind, and vice its disease and disorder. That nation is in a dreadful way, in which almost every mind is <HI>diseased</HI> and <HI>dis|ordered.</HI></P>
<P>The ancient politicians placed their whole depen|dence for the safety of their governments, on the vir|tue and patriotism of their people. Now we place our security in our commerce, our fleet, our treasures, our ministry's skill in managing a house of commons. Formerly the fortunes of private men were the strength of the state. Now the public money is the object of the general avarice. The great kingdoms and states of antiquity had the same internal force of men and
<PB N="6" REF="013851_1030_0F9E2E028C17D728">
money, after they lost their liberties, as when they had them. But a nation of men, who only fight for their country, or undertake the administration of their country, because they are paid for it, are very dif|ferent from a nation of men who are willing to die for their country.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Elle [Athenes] considerait, &amp;c.</HI> The Athenians considered, that in a republic manners were above all things necessary <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Montesqu.</HI> III.32.</NOTE>.</Q>
In <HI>England</HI> we never consider this.</P>
<P>The <HI>Athenians</HI> did not suffer those who frequented lewd women, to harangue the people. <HI>Demosthenes</HI> highly approves this law <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">ANT. UNIV. HIST. VI.314.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>A magistrate overtaken in liquor was severely punish|ed; the first archon, though accidentally, with death.</P>
<P>It was impossible for any man at <HI>Athens</HI> to live a dissolute life unreproved: for every man was liable to be sent for by the Areopagites, to be examined, and punished, if guilty.

<P><HI>Emmius</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">DE REP. ATHEN. I.107.</NOTE> accounts for the long duration of liberty in the <HI>Athenian</HI> republic, by observing that the people were of a sublime, bold, and penetrating genius, as much superior to the other states of <HI>Greece,</HI> as the other states of <HI>Greece</HI> were to the barbarous people. That
<PB N="7" REF="013851_1031_0F9E2E05DC241DE8">
there was continually rising among them a succession of men eminent for political wisdom and integrity, who planted in the minds of the people sentiments of true patriotism, and inspired them with such a love of liberty, that every <HI>Athenian</HI> was ready to pour out his best blood for its preservation. That the people were, by <HI>Solon,</HI> taught, that the strength of a free state con|sists in its laws; that laws are nothing, unless they be obeyed; that laws will not be obeyed, unless honour be given to the obedient, and punishment inflicted on transgressors; that the laws are not to be subjected to the government, but the government to the laws; that riches, interest, and party are to yield to the laws, not the laws to them. That therefore in the best times of that commonwealth, honours and re|wards were given in such a manner, as tended to lead the persons honoured and rewarded to gratitude rather than to ambition, which <HI>Demosthenes</HI> exemplifies in the case of <HI>Miltiades, Cimon, Themistocles,</HI> and others. And on the contrary, whoever made himself obnoxious to the laws of his country, was to expect no allevia|tion on account of his riches, his family, or even of his former meritorious actions. Accordingly <HI>Miltia|des, Themistocles, Cimon,</HI> and others, though eminent for their public services, were not spared, when thought to have violated the laws. For the <HI>Athenians</HI> con|sidered, that it is the duty of a citizen to behave well, not on one occasion only, but at all times; not to be at first zealous, faithful, and obedient, and afterwards a lawless plunderer; for that this is not the behaviour of men of principle, who are uniform in their con|duct, but of artful and insidious men, who study only to surprise the public opinion, that they may deceive with the better success. That the <HI>Athenians</HI> were, above all other nations, severe against corruption a|bove
<PB N="8" REF="013851_1032_0F9E2E06CBBBA1B0">
all other offences, as what tends most directly to the destruction of states. The <HI>Athenians,</HI> there|fore, punished this crime with a fine to ten times the value of the bribe, or with outlawry, or death; some of which punishments were inflicted even on those, who had on other occasions deserved well of their country, as <HI>Timotheus, Epicrates, Thrasybulus</HI> the younger, and others. Another cause of the flourish|ing state of the <HI>Athenian</HI> republic, was the encourage|ment given to marriage and population. Another was the wise severity of <HI>Solon,</HI> in bringing upon the offences of magistrates a swifter punishment than on those of private persons; for that the latter might be delayed; but if the former was put off, things might quickly come into such disorder, that it would be too late to think of punishing powerful offenders; besides, that the offences of private persons may be compared with those of the common sailors, on board of a ship, which may not prove fatal to the crew; but the crimes of magistrates are like those of the master, or pilot, which endanger the loss of ship, loading, crew, and passengers. That <HI>Solon</HI> likewise laid great stress on the education of youth, that they might be habituat|ed to virtue, industry, courage, and love of their country. That his laws tended to honour, wisdom, and virtue, and to bring disgrace on the contrary characters, by refusing to men of profligate lives all honours in the state, and even forbidding them to speak in the assembly of the people. For the wise legislator thought there was little probability, that he, who could not manage his own private estate, would administer that of the public with frugality and wis|dom; and that the people would not, or however ought not, to pay any regard to the patriotic harangues of a man, who studied more to polish his speeches, than to regulate his life.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013851_1033_0F9E2E09644F9BC8">While all <HI>Europe</HI> groaned under the chain of <HI>Roman</HI> tyranny, the <HI>Germans,</HI> and northern nations, preserv|ed their liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Tacitus</HI> says, nobody among the <HI>Germans</HI> laughs at vice; or apologises for corruption, by saying, it is uni|versally practised <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DE MOR. GERM.</NOTE>. But the <HI>Germans</HI> were barbarous heathens; we are polite christians.</P>
<P><HI>Hannibal,</HI> when praetor of <HI>Carthage,</HI> set about re|forming abuses, regulated the finances, restrained the injustice of the judges, and peculation of the gran|dees, and collectors of the revenues, who were got to such a degree of open corruption, that they pre|tended a lawful title to whatever they could plunder from the people. The many proved of course too hard for one. Yet (such is the advantage of integrity) they had no means for this purpose, but exciting the <HI>Romans</HI> against him. The consequence was, that this illustrious warrior and reformer, who had bled for his country, and had laboured for its reformation, was driven into exile, and hunted from country to country, like a felon, and at last beset in his retire|ment by his enemies, and only escaped the cruelties, they would have inflicted on him by destroying him|self.</P>
<P>Every page of the history of the great revolution of <HI>Rome</HI> shews some instance of the degeneracy of the <HI>Roman</HI> virtue, and of the impossibility of a nation's continuing free after its virtue is gone.</P>
<P>It is thought by many of the authors of this part of the <HI>Roman</HI> history, that such was the corruption of manners, that the greatest part of those who opposed <HI>Iulius,</HI> were enemies to the man rather than to his cause <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">ANT. UNIV. HIST. XIII.410.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>With the power which <HI>Iulius</HI> had, he might have reformed, instead of enslaving, his country.

<P>Here a distinction is to be made between a people in|capable of free government, and a people among whom the spirit of liberty is got to so low an ebb, that they have not the courage to seize it, when put within their reach, or to resist the attempts of those who would deprive them of it.

<PB N="21" REF="013851_1045_0F9E2E1CEAFDDFE8">
would have been free; and there is no doubt, but he had it in his power to restore it, and probably to keep it up, during his life (as <HI>Epaminondas</HI> made his stupid countrymen the <HI>Boeotians</HI> great in spite of themselves during his life), and he is inexcusable for neglecting the opportunity, and instead of pursuing the glorious views of <HI>Brutus,</HI> rivetting the chain which <HI>Iulius</HI> had fastened but slightly; and flattering the senators, that he underwent so many labours and perils only to re|store peace to the <HI>Romans.</HI> Those abject slaves decree him honours for dashing out of their hands their liber|ties, when within their grasp <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">ANT.

<P>The <HI>Romans,</HI> it is true, at the time of <HI>Caesar</HI>'s exe|cution, were ripe for slavery. None to seize liberty, when put in their hands.
<Q>They were no longer that nation of heroes, to whom liberty was dearer than life. They were become effeminate, debauched, and accustomed to live by the price of their votes, which they sold to the best bidder <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 283, 4, 5.</NOTE>.</Q>
Time was, and continued for many ages, when it would have been no disputable point, whether a tyrant was to be extirpated or not, as it was on this occasion <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 286. the various opinions of the senators, concerning the de|stroyers of <HI>Caesar.</HI></NOTE>.

Great was their fright and consternation at the sight of so dismal a scene; for the emperor had often publickly declared that he could not think himself safe so long as one senator was left alive, and that amongst the knights there were few, whom he did not look upon as his enemies. After they had long waited expecting every moment their last doom, the doors were at length all on a sudden burst open, when a great number of naked persons, having their bodies all over dyed black, entered the hall, with drawn swords in one hand, and flaming torches in the other.

<P><Q>And now to recapitulate the reasons of this great people's ruin, first, their luxuries extinguished an|tient honour, and in its room introduced irregular ambition; ambition brought on civil wars; civil war made single persons too considerable to remain afterwards in a private condition; so that the foun|dation of their destruction was laid in the century wherein <HI>Caesar</HI> invaded their liberties: however, they might have continued a powerful and flourishing na|tion for many ages, if the succeeding princes had imitated either <HI>Iulius</HI> or <HI>Augustus.</HI> But many of those that followed, assumed to themselves unlimited authority; and when bad emperors came, they pulled down what had been building up by the wis|dom of all their predecessors. They seized upon that treasure which the frugality of preceding times
<PB N="29" REF="013851_1053_0F9E2E275096C3E0">
had set aside for urgent occasions. They accounted the public revenues to be their own particular pro|perty, and to be disposed of at their pleasure. Such as were lavish, squandered away among their minions and favourites, that which was to maintain the dig|nity of the state. When their profusion had reduced them to necessities, they fell to laying exorbitant taxes, and to pillage the remote provinces: when these provinces were harassed and exhausted by con|tinual payments, they became weak and unable to resist foreign invasions. In these naked and defence|less provinces the barbarians nestled themselves, and when they were grown strong and powerful, from thence they made irruptions into <HI>Italy,</HI> till at last they came to invade and conquer <HI>Rome</HI> itself, the very head and seat of the empire. From this brief account of the <HI>Roman</HI> affairs, perhaps it will appear, that to let ministers waste the public revenues, or to suffer any negligence and profusion of the like na|ture, is of dangerous consequence both to the prince and people <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Daven.</HI> III.56.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P>The welfare of all countries in the world depends upon the morals of their people. For though a nation may get riches by trade, thrift, industry, and from the benefit of its soil and situation; and though a peo|ple may attain to great wealth and power either by force of arms, or by the sagacity of their councils; yet when their manners are depraved, they will decline insensibly, and at last come to utter destruction. When a country is grown vicious, industry decays, the people become effeminate and unfit for labour. To maintain luxury, the great ones must oppress the meanest; and to avoid this oppression, the meaner sort are often compelled to seditious tumults or open rebellion. Such, therefore, who have modelled go|vernments for any duration, have endeavoured to pro|pose methods by which the riotous appetites, the lusts, avarice, revenge, ambition, and other disorderly pas|sions of the people might be bounded <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Daven.</HI> II.41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the sobriety, and temperate way of living, practised by the Dissenters retired to <HI>America,</HI> we may justly attribute the increase they have made there of in|habitants, which is beyond the usual proportion to be seen any where else.

It must then follow, that their thrift and regular manner of living incline them more, and make them more healthful for generation, and afford them better means of having the necessaries to sustain life, as wholesome food, and cleanly

<P>Where riot and luxuries are not discountenanced, the inferior rank of men become presently infected, and grow lazy, effeminate, impatient of labour, and expensive, and, consequently, cannot thrive by trade and tillage; so that when we contemplate the great in|crease and improvements, which have been made in <HI>New England, Carolina,</HI> and <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> we cannot but think it injustice not to say, that a large share of this general good to these parts is owing to the educa|tion of their planters; which, if not entirely virtuous, has a show of virtue; and, if this were only an ap|pearance, it is yet better for a people that are to subsist in a new country by traffic and industry, than the open profession and practice of lewdness, which is al|ways attended with national decay and poverty <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Daven.</HI> II.33.</NOTE>.</P>

To cure this evil, the bishop, very judiciously, advises the clergy to use two courses, <HI>viz.</HI> catechising, that is, explaining to young people, in a familiar man|ner, the first principles of religion, and of morality; and preaching in the same manner on the same sub|jects; applying their discourses to the characters of their audience, setting before them the evil nature and consequences of the vices they know them to be par|ticularly addicted to.</P>

After all that he did, during the course of his reign, it was scarce credible, that the same temper should have re|turned in his time: yet he recovered it in the last four years of his reign; and the gentry of <HI>England</HI> were as active and zealous to throw up all their liberties, as their ancestors had ever been to preserve them. This disposition continued above half a year in his brother's reign; and he depended so much upon it, that he thought it could never go out of his hands. But he, or rather his priests, had the dexterity to play this game away likewise, and lose it a second time; so that at the Revolution, all seemed to come again to their wits. But men who have no principles, cannot be steady. Now, <HI>A.

This is a folly of so singular a nature, that it wants a name. It is natural for poor men, who have little to lose, and much to hope for, to become the instru|ments of slavery; but it is an extravagance peculiar to our age, to see rich men in love with slavery and ar|bitrary power.

<P><Q>The profligacy of the common people, at this time, [about <HI>A. D.</HI> 1751,] called for some legal re|straint; for not only every city and town, but almost every village had assemblies of music, dancing, and gaming. This occasioned a prodigious dissipation of the time, money, and morals of the lower people. Robberies were so frequent, that the enormity of the crime was almost effaced in the minds of the people; and nothing was more common than to advertise in the news-papers, an impunity to any person who could bring to a party that was robbed, the effects that had been taken from them, and that too with a reward according to the value. Those disorders were very justly ascribed, in a great measure, to the extra|vagance of the common people, and therefore a bill was brought in for the better preventing thefts and robberies, and for regulating places of public enter|tainment, and punishing people keeping disorderly houses. The operation of this bill, when it passed the house of commons, was confined to <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> and twenty miles round; and all persons within that circuit were required to take out licences from the justices of the peace of the county, assem|bled at their quarter sessions, before they could open any room or place for public dancing, music, or any other entertainment of the like kind. Several other regulations regarding idle, disorderly, or suspected persons and houses, were inserted in the same act, and pecuniary as well as corporal penalties were affixed to the transgressors. When this bill went to the
<PB N="36" REF="013851_1060_0F9E2E2F9E0C2380">
house of lords, they thought so well of it, that they extended the operation of it all over <HI>England.</HI> But as a tax was laid by it upon the subject, when they re|turned the bill to the house of commons, their a|mendments were unanimously disagreed to, because they would not suffer the lords to alter any bill that was to affect the purse of the subject. They therefore desired a conference of the lords, and appointed a committee to draw up reasons against the amendments. The lords, on the other hand, having never formally given up their right to amend money bills, could not receive the true reason of the dissent of the commons, without giving up that right, or coming to an open breach with them. The commons therefore, to a|void so disagreeable an emergency, drew up reasons against the amendment, which had no regard or con|nexion with the true reason of their disagreeing with them; and the lords rather than so good a bill should be lost, agreed not to insist upon their amendments; and thus the bill passed, and received the royal assent <NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB.

the common good, that nation will soon gather such strength as shall resist any home-bred mischief, or outward accident. No great thing was ever done, but by such as have preferred the love of their coun|try to all other considerations; and wherever this public spirit reigns, and where this zeal for the com|mon good governs in the minds of men, that state will flourish, and increase in riches and power, and wherever it declines, or is set at nought, weakness, disorder, and poverty must be expected.

And when any empire is destined to be undone, or to lose its freedom, the seeds of this ruin are to be first seen in the corruption of its manners. In vi|cious governments, all care of the public is laid aside, and every one is plundering for himself, as if the commonwealth were adrift, or had suffered ship|wreck; and where a people is thus depraved, their na|tional assemblies have the first open marks of the in|fection upon them, from whence spring all disorders in the state whatsoever. For then such as have most eloquence, valour, skill in business, and most interest in their country, throw off the mask of popularity, which they had put on for a time, and in the face of the world desire wealth, honours, and greatness, upon any terms; and this ambition leads them to corrupt others, that their own natural vices may be the less observed; so that in a constitution ripe for change, those who are best esteemed, and most trusted, begin to buy the people's voice, and afterwards expose to sale their own suffrages; which practice is always

<P>Mr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> in the debate, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1744, on the motion for annual parliaments, argues, that long par|ments produce, and increase corruption of manners in the people. 'Sir, says he, the middling people in this country have always, till of late years, been re|markable for their bravery, generosity, and hospita|lity, and those of inferior rank for their honesty frugality, and industry. These are the virtues which raised this nation to that height of glory, riches, and power it had once arrived at; but these virtues are every one of them in danger of being utterly extinguished by ministerial corruption at elections, and in par|liament. For proving this, I have no occasion to appeal to any thing but experience under the late ad|ministration, the decay of every one of these virtues, and the causes of that decay became so visible to every thinking man in the kingdom, that the whole nation, except the very tools of the minister, joined in putting an end to his power, and thank God, with the help of a very extraordinary conjuncture at court,
<PB N="40" REF="013851_1064_0F9E2E32B4AF9450">
we at last in some degree succeeded in our endeavours. For this reason I say I need not appeal to any thing but experience, for shewing what an effect public corruption has upon private as well as public vir|tue; but as it may be proved by reason, as well as experience, and as I think it necessary to take ad|vantage of every argument that can be thought of for establishing the truth of this proposition, I shall beg leave to consider separately every one of the vir|tues I have mentioned, in order to shew from the reason of things how necessarily it must decay, in pro|portion as public corruption is introduced. And first with regard to courage or bravery. Though courage or resolution, Sir, depends in some measure upon the nature or constitution of the man, yet it may be very much increased or diminished by custom and educa|tion, and especially by public rewards bestowed upon, or refused to those who have shewn any remarkable degree of it in the service of their country. In for|mer times, and when we had an honest and wise ad|ministration, the chief method by which our nobi|lity and gentry could recommend themselves to the esteem of their country, or the favour of their so|vereign, was by their courage, and military capacity; and the same consideration made them take notice of those that were in any station below them, which propagated a brave and military spirit among all ranks of men in the kingdom. In those days our ministers did not desire any man in parliament to vote as they directed. They desired no man to vote, but accord|ing to the dictates of his own conscience, and there|fore they never thought of rewarding those who ap|proved, much less of punishing those who disapproved, of their measures in parliament. At elections again, though a seat in parliament was always reckoned ho|nourable,

yet as it was in antient times reckoned ra|ther burdensome than profitable, there was never any violent competition at the election, and consequently the person chosen never thought himself much obliged to those who voted for him, nor did they so much as expect any favours from him upon that account alone. But no sooner did ministers begin to solicit the votes, instead of convincing the reason of the members of parliament, then they begun to think themselves obliged to reward those who complied with their solicitations; and soon after this practice was introduced, a seat in parliament became profita|ble as well as honourable, which of course begot vio|lent competition at elections; and this made voters begin to claim a merit with those in favour of whom they gave their vote at any election.</P>

<P><Q>From henceforth, Sir, the natural channel through which all public honours and preferments flowed, be|gan to be disused, and betraying our country to the will of a minister in parliaments or at elections, began to be the only channel through which a man could expect any honours or preferment. When this be|gan, or whether it has not met with some interruptions since it first began, I shall not determine; but this I will say, that it never became so apparent as it did under the late administration; and I wish we may not fatally feel the consequence of it in the war we are now engaged in. The natural courage of English|men is not by any discouragements to be absolutely extinguished; but I wish it may not have taken a wrong turn: I wish we may not find that the cou|rage of our men is become rather an avaricious than an ambitious courage, and that men now seek to raise by their courage their private fortunes rather than
<PB N="42" REF="013851_1066_0F9E2E3706EA3BB0">
their own or their country's glory; for if that be the case, we may make good pirates or maroder<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, but we shall never, while this spirit remains, make good sol|diers or seamen; and no man, I believe, can expect that we should be able to put a glorious end to the war either by piracy or maroding. Courage, Sir, like many other good qualities, becomes laudable only according to the use that is made of it, and the mo|tives upon which it is founded; for a man who ven|tures his life with no other view but that of raising his own private fortune, differs from a common high|wayman in nothing but this, that the one plunders according to law, the other against it. When I say this, Sir, I hope it will not be thought, that I intend to reflect upon any of those brave men who have ventured their lives in taking prizes from the enemies of their country: for as they thereby weaken the enemy, it is a public service as well as a private ad|vantage; and when the first of these motives is their chief inducement, which I hope it always is with re|gard to the officers at least, they deserve the esteem and applause of their country. From such gentlemen we may expect an equal behaviour, where nothing but blows and triumphs are to be got: from the enemy; but this is not to be expected from those who have nothing but the prize in view. This sort of courage, which proceeds from sordid avarice, I have mentioned, Sir, only to shew that we are not to suppose, that all the bold actions we read of in our journals, proceed from that true and generous spirit of courage by which our ancestors were actuated; nor are we to judge of the spirit of a people from what appears in their regular armies or navies, because a spirit of courage may for some time be preserved in the armies or navies of a country, after it has been industriously
<PB N="43" REF="013851_1067_0F9E2E3711129B00">
depressed among all other ranks of men. The only way to judge in this case, is to consider the conduct and behaviour of the gentlemen of fortune in that country, the methods they take to recommend them|selves to the esteem of their country, and the qualifica|tions which recommend those of inferior rank to their favour; and from these considerations we must con|clude, that the antient spirit of the people of this na|tion is now almost entirely extinct. Do we now see any gentleman of fortune who is not of the army or navy, endeavouring to recommend himself by his courage or military knowledge? Do we now hear of the armies of foreign princes being encouraged by the example of a crowd of English volunteers? Do we now hear of any gentleman's encouraging his tenants and servants to make themselves masters of military disci|pline, or con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erring distinguishing favours upon those who have shewn great courage and resolution upon any occasion? Few such examples are to be met with in our present story; and the reason is plain: All public favours are now bestowed upon voting, not fighting. If a man be qualified to vote, he has no oc|casion for any other qualification; and of late years, even in our army or navy, it has appeared to be the best qualification for entitling a man to preferment. We must therefore demolish this superstructure, which has been raised by corruption. We must render it impossible for a minister to expect to gain a majority in parliament, or at election, either by bribery or by a proper dispensation of places and preferments. I say, we must do this, if we intend to restore that spirit of bravery by which our ancestors preserved their liberties, and gained so much glory to their country; and for this purpose nothing can, in my opinion, be so effectual as the restoration of annual parliaments.
<PB N="44" REF="013851_1068_0F9E2E384548A940">
Then, Sir, as to the generosity and hospitality of our nobility and gentry, every one knows, that by long parliaments and corrupt elections, they have been banished almost entirely out of the country; for I hope it will not be called generosity, to give a country fel|low, by express bargain, five or ten guineas for his vote; and as little will it, I hope, be called hospita|lity to make a county or borough drunk once in seven years, by way of preparation for an ensuing election. In former times most of our noblemen and gentlemen lived at their country seats, where they often gene|rously relieved such of the poor in the neighbourhood as were in real distress; and they daily entertained their friends and neighbours at their houses, not with luxuries and extravagant feasts, but with a plentiful and hospitable table. By these methods they recom|mended themselves to the favour of their country, or of some neighbouring city or borough, and in return, if they desired it, they had sometimes the honour con|ferred upon them of representing it in parliament, which being but of short duration, it never induced them to think of altering their method of living, or of leaving their seat in the country. But since the in|troduction of septennial parliaments, and with them of course the practice of downright bribery at all elections, this method of living has been entirely altered, and no wonder it should be so; for suppose a gentleman to have lived in the most generous and hospitable manner in his country, or in the neigh|bourhood of his borough; suppose such a gentleman sets up for their representative, down comes a cour|tier with his pockets full of public money, and offers the electors, or such of them as will vote for him, seven guineas a man: by such an offer the country gentle|man's friendship, his generosity, his hospitality, are
<PB N="45" REF="013851_1069_0F9E2E38965525D8">
all at once effaced out of the memories of many of them, and he is thereby defeated of his election. Is it not natural for such a gentleman to resolve, not to put himself any more to the trouble and expence of being generous and hospitable? The favour of his countrymen he sees must be purchased, not won; therefore he resolves to contract his expence, in or|der to prepare the proper ammunition for the next election; and if he succeeds, being then assured of his seat in parliament for seven years, and sensible that being in the country can be of no service to him on any future election, he retires with his family to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and resolves to depend upon bribery alone for his success in every future election. Thus, Sir, an end is put to the generosity and hospitality of that gentle|man, and thus an end has already been put to the generosity and hospitality of most of the noblemen and gentlemen of the kingdom. But this is not the only evil, for this change of a country life into a town life, has introduced a new sort of expence, which is of the most pernicious consequence to the kingdom in ge|neral, and to the landed interest in particular. By the antient country hospitality a great deal was, it is true, consumed, but the consumption was all our own: almost the whole, excepting a few spiceries, was the produce of our own farmers; whereas the expence attending a town life is mostly laid out on things of foreign importation, and most of them of such a nature as tend to deprive us of every good qua|lity we have left among us. One modern polite sup|per in town, with a set of Italian musicians to entertain the company, will now cost as much as would formerly have hospitably entertained a whole country for a week; with this difference, that the expence of the latter centered chiefly in the pocket of the neighbour|ing
<PB N="46" REF="013851_1070_0F9E2E394FFF8CF0">
farmers, whereas the expence of the former cen|ters chiefly in the pocket of foreigners, and those fo|reigners, perhaps, who are our most dangerous ene|mies. When I consider this, Sir, I do not wonder at the heavy complaints we hear among the farmers in all parts of the kingdom, for want of a market for their goods, nor do I wonder at so many of them be|coming bankrupt. A man of fortune who lives in <HI>London</HI>&punc; may, in plays, operas, routs, assemblies, French cookery, French sauces, and French wines, spend as much yearly as he could do, were he to live in the most hospitable manner at his seat in the country; but will any one suppose, that there is as much malt, meat, bread, or poultry consumed in his family? Will any one suppose, that the poor, or even the farmers and tradesmen, in the neighbour|hood of his country-seat consume as much, when they have nothing but what they take from their own table, as when they had his hall to feast in? What a diminution then in country consumptions must the retiring of one g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat family make? What a distress must be brought upon a country, especially if remote from <HI>London,</HI> when all its rich families repair to live constantly in this city? Sir, the fatal consequences brought upon our land estates by thus tempting our rich families to live constantly in <HI>London,</HI> are so glar|ing, that I shall wonder to see any landed gentle|man in this house oppose the motion; and if any of them do, I shall be very apt to suppose they have some other income less honourable, though perhaps more punctual; for that annual parliaments would send most of our rich families to the country, and restore our antient generosity and hospitality, is a question that can admit of no dispute; because no gentleman could then preserve his interest in his
<PB N="47" REF="013851_1071_0F9E2E3A0BEF8AC0">
country, city, or borough, but by going to live amongst them; and if by neglecting to live there he should be turned out of parliament, I believe the most courtly dame could hardly prevail upon the most uxo|rious husband to live in <HI>London,</HI> after having nothing to do there but to see her play at quadrille. I now come, Sir, to those good qualities or virtues for which the inferior rank of our people were very remarkable. These, I said, were honesty, frugality, and industry. As to every one of these, the manners of our people have been very much altered by the introduction of septennial parliaments, and the corruption and vio|lent contestation at elections, which have thereby of course been propagated through the whole king|dom. With regard to the honesty of the people, perhaps an instance may be here and there found of a man who acts honestly in private life, and yet has made it his practice to sell his vote to the best bidder. But I will say, that such a man's honesty proceeds more from the fear of the gallows than from any na|tural disposition; and it is well known that few men jump at once into the height of wickedness. They generally begin with little venial sins, and move by degrees to the most aggravating crimes. Do not most of the wretches that suffer at Tyburn tell us, that they began their wicked course with a breach of the sabbath? This is none of the most heinous sort of crimes; but the danger consists in the first encroach|ment upon conscience; for being once got into a wicked course they seldom stop at the threshold. In the same manner a man who sells his vote at an elec|tion, to a candidate who he thinks will sell his coun|try in parliament, must be sensible he has committed a crime: In so doing he certainly acts against his conscience, and by this means his acting against his
<PB N="48" REF="013851_1072_0F9E2E3AE6D08DD0">
conscience, becomes familiar to him, which prepares him for the committing of any crime he thinks he may be safe in, and then if he commits no crime in private life, it is not for want of will, but for want of opportunity. He is honest, just as some women are chaste, only because they never had an opportunity of being otherwise. The only difference is, that he be|comes wicked by custom, whereas they are so by na|ture. We should, therefore, in order to preserve the honesty of our people, prevent, as much as possible, a man's being tempted to sell his vote at an election, and the best method for doing this will be to restore annual parliaments, because no candidate will then be at the expence of corrupting, especially as he cannot expect to be corrupted by a minister after he is chosen. Now, Sir, with regard to the frugality of the people, we know by experience, that what people get by sell|ing their votes at an election, is generally spent in extravagance; and being once led into an extravagant manner of living, few of them ever leave it, as long as they have a penny to support it. By this means they are led into necessities, and having once broke in upon their conscience, by selling their vote at an election, they are the less proof against those temptations they are exposed to by their necessities; so that I am per|suaded, many a poor man in this kingdom has been brought to the gallows by the bribe he received for his vote at an election. Besides, as all the little places under the government have of late been bestowed upon pliable voters at elections, without requiring any one other quality to recommend them, such voters generally dissipate their own substance, in hopes of being afterwards provided for by some little place in government; and, by the example of such voters, many of their neighbours are led into the
<PB N="49" REF="013851_1073_0F9E2E3B8E67A328">
same extravagant course of living, which, I believe, is one great cause of that luxury which now so gene|rally prevails among the lower sort of people. The same causes, Sir, that promote the people's extrava|gance prevent their being industrious. Whilst a lit|tle country freeholder or tradesman is spending in ex|travagance his infamous earnings at an election, he disdains to think of honest industry or labour; and being once got out of the road of industry, many of them cannot find their way into it again. If such fellows are not provided by the court candidate who was chosen by their venality, with some little post in the government, which all expect, but few are so lucky as to meet with, they soon become bankrupts, are thrown into prison, and their families a burden upon the country which they have sold and betrayed. This is the fate of most of them; and as to those who happen to be provided for, their good luck is of the most pernicious consequence in the neighbourhood, because it encourages others to become venal, in hopes of meeting with the same good fortune; for in this case it is the same as in a lottery, people overlook the thousands that are unfortunate, and take notice only of the happy few that get the great prizes: If it were not for this unaccountable humour in mankind, no man would be an adventurer in a lottery; no man, even in this corrupt age, would sell his vote at an election. But whilst this humour remains, which it will do as long as the race of man subsists, there will be adventurers, there will be sellers. There is no preventing it, but by demolishing the market; and this, I think, will be the effect of the bill now pro|posed to you, if it be passed into a law: it will de|molish the market of corruption, both in this house and at every election in the kingdom, for ministers
<PB N="50" REF="013851_1074_0F9E2E3C82DF9C68">
will not then corrupt, because they can expect no success by corruption; and though little contests may now and then happen among country gentlemen, yet they will never be so violent as to occasion cor|ruption on either side of the question. On the con|trary, Sir, I believe very few contests will ever hap|pen among the country gentlemen; for in every coun|ty, city, and borough in the kingdom, the chief fa|milies will come to a compromise amongst themselves, and agree to take the honour by turns, of representing it in parliament. No man will grudge his neighbour the honour for one year, when he knows he is to have the same honour the next year, or in a year or two after, especially when that honour is to be attend|ed with no expectation of any post, place, or pension from the crown, unless he can recommend himself to it by some other qualification: whereas, when a gen|tleman is to be chosen into parliament for seven years, and when his being a member, without so much as the appearance of any other qualification, is known to be sufficient for recommending or rather enlisting him to some place of great profit under the crown, I do not wonder at his often meeting with a violent opposition. The length of the term makes any such compromise as I have mentioned impossible, which of course creates him antagonists among those who are only ambitious of the honour; and the expectation of advantage creates him antagonists, among those who are resoved to make their market. This gener|ally begets a violent opposition; and if the antagonist be one of the better sort, he generally has recourse to bribery; for as he is resolved to sell, he makes no scruple to purchase, if he thinks he can purchase for less than he may sell. These, Sir, are the causes why we find such violent contests about elections to sep|tennial
<PB N="51" REF="013851_1075_0F9E2E3F2E8DB980">
parliaments; and as all these causes would cease the moment we made our parliaments annual, I think it is next to a demonstration, that in elections for annual parliaments there could be no violent op|position, and much less any bribery or corruption. Therefore, if we have a mind to restore the practice of these virtues, for which our ancestors were so conspicu|ous, and by which they handed down to us riches, glory, renown, and liberty, we must restore the cus|tom of having parliaments not only annually held but annually chosen.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>The opinion my honourable friend has of what we ought to do upon this occasion, and the addition he has proposed to be made to our address, viz. pro|missing the king, that the house would frame bills for checking abuses, and restraining corruption, are so agreeable to my way of thinking, that I cannot avoid standing up to second his motion, I shall readily con|cur with those gentlemen who think that we ought upon this occasion to express, in the warmest terms, our loyalty to our king, and our steady resolution to support him against all his enemies, both foreign and domestic; and I hope they will concur with me, and I believe many other gentlemen in this house, that we ought at the same time, and with the same energy, to express our fidelity to our country, and our steady reso|lution to support the liberties of the people against the fatal effects of corruption, which, in my opinion, are as much to be dreaded as any effects that can en|sue from the success of the present rebellion. From arbitrary power established in our present royal family,
<PB N="52" REF="013851_1076_0F9E2E4066E2AA88">
and supported by a corrupt parliament, and a mer|cenary standing army, I shall grant, Sir, we are in no immediate danger of popery; but the certain conse|quence will be a general depravity of manners, and a total extinction of religion of every kind; and then if chance, or any foreign view should make some future king even of our present royal family, turn papist, which is far from being impossible, how could we guard against the introduction and establishment of popery? To a man who has no religion at all, it signifies nothing what sort of religion is established; for he will always make that sort or sect his profes|sion, which he finds most suitable to his interest, con|sequently such a king would meet with no opposi|tion from the people; and our laws against popery would be no bar to his intentions, because every one of them would at his desire be repealed by a corrupt parliament; therefore the only sure and lasting fence we can have against popery is, the preservation of our constitution. Whilst the people continue to have any religion, and are generall, sincere protestants, no king, should he turn papist himself, can have it in his power to introduce, much l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ss establish popery amongst us, if the people be freely and fairly represented in parliament; but a government that proposes to sup|port i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">self by corruption, must at the same time en|deavour to abolish all principles of honour and reli|gion; for a man who has any principle of either, will never frame any selfish motive, give his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ote in parliament, or at elections, against what he knows to be the true interest of his country. Such a govern|ment must necessarily conduct itself in direct opposi|tion to all the maxims of true policy. Merit of every kind will be disregarded, religion will be laughed at, and patriotism turned into ridicule. Libertinism will
<PB N="53" REF="013851_1077_0F9E2E40CCD9E2F0">
be encouraged, avarice will be fed, and luxury will be propagated, in order to render the operation of corruption the more easy, and its effect the more cer|tain. And when the people are generally and tho|roughly corrupted, which, because of our frequent elections, they must be before the government can for its support depend upon corruption alone, the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> whose politicks we have more rea|son to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ead than her power, will have a much more easy and certain game to play, than that of forcing the Pretender upon us. This, Sir, they can never do as long as we have any religion, virtue, or courage amongst us, and should they by an extraordinary mischance succeed, the Pretender and they together, would find it a very difficult task to convert a whole nation of religious and sincere protestants to popery: besides, they could not be sure of the Pretender's not serving them as <HI>Henry</HI> II. of <HI>France</HI> served the pro|testants of that kingdom: after they had helped him to the throne, supposing him to be a man of sense and no bigot, he might very probably for his own ease and security, declare himself of the same religion with the majority of his subjects. But should we lose our liberties by corruption, and of course our religion and virtue, if the church of <HI>Rome</HI> could find means to convert our king then upon the throne, their business would be done. Our nobility having no religion, would in complaisance, or in order to re|commend themselves to their sovereign, declare themselves papists; and the majority of the people having as little religion as they, would follow their example. Surely, Sir, it will not be said to be impos|sible to suppose that any future king, even of our pre|sent royal family, can ever be converted to popery. How many kings have been persuaded to change their
<PB N="54" REF="013851_1078_0F9E2D6DB4F0E6F8">
religion by a favourite wife or mistress? How ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> from political views? The crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> but of late years made one protestant prince declare himself papist, though all his then subjects were protestants too. The imperial crown of <HI>Germany</HI> we know is elective; and a view to that crown may induce some future king of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to declare himself papist; if he has a corrupt parliament, they will be ready at his desire, to repeal that law by which papists are ex|cluded from the crown and government of these realms. We have therefore no infallible security against popery, but the preservation of our constitu|tion, and for this reason, nothing can be more pro|per than to declare our resolution, that we will take care to frame such bills as are necessary for the pre|servation of our constitution against corruption, at the same time, that we declare our resolution to sup|port his majesty against a popish Pretender. This is not only proper, Sir, but necessary upon the present occasion, in order to convince the world that we are true protestants, as well as loyal subjects, and that therefore we are resolved to keep every door bolted, by which popery can make its way into this king|dom; and if we are resolved to frame and pass, in this session, any bills that may be effectual against corruption, I am sure no objection can be made against our declaring in our address that we will do so. I hope we are all now convinced that some such bills are necessary. The danger we are now exposed to, and the present unlucky circumstances of <HI>Europe</HI> must convince every man of the necessity of our having such bills passed into laws; for the danger our liber|ties are now exposed to, and the danger to which the liberties of <HI>Europe</HI> are now exposed, are both evi|dently owing to the measures of a late administra|tion.
<PB N="55" REF="013851_1079_0F9E2D6E0FC9FA18">
Measures that could never have been approved of by a british parliament, if the eyes of some gentle|men's understandings had not been blinded by the lucrative places they expected, or those they were afraid to lose. The fatal consequence of those mea|sures were then foretold, and are now so plainly seen, that those who approved of them, if they speak in|genuously, must confess their having been misled. I am far from saying, Sir, that any gentleman who had the honour to represent his country in parliament, voted against the dictates of his conscience; but it is a failing of human nature to judge weakly, in cases where our private interest is concerned, which we may be daily convinced of by many law-suits, that are obstinately carried on by men even of the best sense in the kingdom. We must therefore banish, as much as possible, all private interest from this house, other|wise we can never expect to have the questions that come before us impartially considered, or rightly de|termined. For this purpose, Sir, I hope every gen|tleman is now convinced, that some new bills are ne|cessary, and if we are resolved to frame any such in this session, why should we not say so in our address upon this occasion? I can suggest to myself no rea|son against it, and I am very sure it will give great satisfaction without doors. From hence, I must sup|pose that my honoured friends motion will meet with no opposition, and therefore I shall add no more, but conclude with heartily seconding it.</Q></P>

For that a brave people will find that in themselves which will repel foreign force; whilst a people ener|vated by luxury are but a nation of women and chil|dren.</P>
<P>The hardy <HI>Spartans,</HI> a handful of men, but those true <HI>men,</HI> baffled the attacks of <HI>Xerxes</HI>'s world in arms. The <HI>Romans,</HI> while they kept up their martial spir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t and discipline, were too hard for all the nations around them, and conquered almost as often as they fought. Afterwards, being debauched by the Em|perors, they fell an easy prey to the hardy <HI>Goths, Alans, Hunns,</HI> &amp;c. The inconsiderable states of <HI>Holland,</HI> a handful of people living in a marsh, resisted for seventy years, and at last baffled the mighty <HI>Spanish</HI> monarchy, and forced them to give up all claim to superiority over the <HI>Netherlands</HI>; which was, in fact, conquering <HI>Spain,</HI> and stripping her of part of her former dominion. <HI>Spain</HI> was enervated by luxury, the effect of the introduction of gold from the mines

of <HI>South America,</HI> whilst the hardy <HI>Dutch,</HI> unexperienc|ed in the enfeebling arts, fought for civil and religious liberty, with an obstinacy never to be tamed or tired out.</P>
<P>It may therefore be started by some readers, that how|ever dangerous luxury may be, we have nothing to fear from that quarter; for that in the late war the <HI>British</HI> arms were universally victorious, beyond all past ex|ample. That therefore luxury can as yet have pro|duced no material effect in this happy country, and cannot be counted among the abuses, of which those collections profess to be a survey, and an inquiry into the means for correcting.</P>
<P>But to set this matter in its true light, there are se|veral particulars respecting the conduct of the late war, to be recollected, as, for instance, that the expence laid out by <HI>Britain</HI> in the late war, was beyond all example; which gives us a <HI>claim</HI> to extraordinary suc|cess; that we took upon <HI>ourselves</HI> the whole weight of the war, trusting nothing to <HI>allies</HI>; that, according to Lord <HI>Chatham</HI>'s account of the matter <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See his speech on the <HI>American</HI> stamp-act.</NOTE>, who him|self conducted the war in its most glorious times, our success was chiefly owing to the hardy <HI>Scots,</HI> among whom it is certain, that luxury has yet made no con|siderable progress.</P>
<P>But besides all this, it is to be remembered, that there are other effects naturally to be expected from the prevalency of luxury in a country, altogether as dan|gerous as this, of its tendency to break the martial spirit of a people. Every man, in proportion to his degeneracy into luxury, becomes more and more ob|noxious to bribery and corruption. He finds wants and desires before unknown; and these wants and desires being <HI>artificial</HI> merely, are without all <HI>bounds</HI> and <HI>limits.</HI> For the whole world is not enough for one fantastic voluptuary; while a very little satisfies nature.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="013851_1085_0F9E2D751F8D54E0">Then he becomes an easy prey to the bribing can|didate at an election; then he is ready to sell his soul to the enemy of mankind, and his country to the French king, in obedience to the order from the mini|ster, who pays him the damning pension, and directs when he is to vote evil to be good, and darkness to be light.</P>
<P>Again, it is notorious, that luxury and expensive living, produce infinite peculation of the public mo|ney, and infidelity in those employed by the public.</P>
<P>It has been disputed, but, I think, with little force of argument on one side of the question, Whether the avaricious man or the spendthrift is the worse member of society?</P>
<P>The avaricious man is ever scraping and heaping up, and what he saves perhaps he locks up in his strong box, to the prejudice of commerce and the injury of those, whom he ruins by cheating, usury, pettifogging, &amp;c. But he will not venture upon any bold and ex|tensive mischief. He keeps within the letter of the law, however he may overleap the bounds of justice; for he has the fear of the pillory and the gibbet before his eyes.</P>
<P>With the prodigal, on the contrary, it is always neck or nothing. He will commit the most daring villany, for the sake of making the figure in life which he aspires at.</P>
<P>The prevalency of luxury in a country, produces multitudes of this atrocious species, of which we see many instances daily. It follows, therefore, that, notwithstanding our late successes in war, indicating a happy superiority to the enervating effects of luxury upon our national courage, or at least upon the courage of our northern people, we have still a great deal to
<PB N="62" REF="013851_1086_0F9E2D75F6008A08">
fear from that formidable internal enemy to manners and principles.</P>
<P>Luxury has been sometimes defended upon the pre|tence of its being favourable to commerce. But there are facts in history, which shew, that it is even capa|ble of ruining commerce. About the time of the Emperor <HI>Iustinian,</HI> his subjects, who are commonly distinguished by the name of the Eastern or <HI>Greek</HI> Em|pire, the capital of which was <HI>Constantinople,</HI> possessed a very advantageous trade to India, which they lost through their luxury and idleness, and the States of <HI>Italy</HI> gained it by their shrewdness, industry, and fru|gality. This is explained by the authors of the MO|DERN UNIVERSAL HISTORY <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">MOD. UNIV. HIST. IX.216.</NOTE> as follows:</P>
<P>The decline of the empire of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> while in the full possession, and that in a more absolute degree than any other nation whatever, of this lucrative trade of the <HI>Indies,</HI> seems to be a strong objection to the principle laid down at the beginning and maintained through the course of this chapter. But this, as the reader will see, is fully accounted for by their con|duct; for while in their hands this commerce was really the source of vast riches and great power, a great part of the former the <HI>Greeks</HI> retained; the remain|der, together with the naval force, they abandoned. The objection then vanishes; for it is impossible to furnish a wanton, idle, and profligate nation with power of any kind, and least of all with a naval force.</P>
<P>Thus luxury is capable of destroying commerce, its parent. Which shews the wisdom (the <HI>necessity,</HI> I had almost said) of setting bounds, as the antients did, by their ostracisms and petalisms, to the effects of exorbitant wealth in individuals.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="013851_1087_0F9E2D77784551B8">It was a custom at the new-year's lustration at <HI>Rome,</HI> for the consul solemnly to pray, that the gods would increase the <HI>Roman</HI> state. But one of those consuls, wiser than the rest, insisted, that the <HI>Roman</HI> state was already great enough, and declared, that he would only pray, that the gods would keep the com|monwealth as it then was; for that it was already great enough. <HI>Horace</HI> in his times, which were later, and more corrupt, saw plainly that <HI>Rome</HI> was too great.</P>
<Q>Suis et ipsa Roma viribus ruit.</Q>
<P><Q>From the riches, and at the same time the fruga|lity of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> it will appear (says Sir <HI>William Temple</HI>) that some of our maxims are not so certain as they are current in our common politics. As that the example and encouragement of excess and luxury if employed in the consumption of native commodi|ties, is of advantage to trade. It may be so, to that which impoverishes, but not to that which enriches a country. It is indeed less prejudicial, if it lies in native than if in foreign wares; but the humour of luxury and expence cannot stop at certain bounds; what begins in native, will proceed in foreign com|modities: and though the example arises among idle persons, yet the imitation will run into all degrees, even of those men by whose industry the nation sub|sists. And besides, the more of our own we spend, the less we shall have to send abroad; and so it will come to pass, that while we drive a vast trade, yet, by buying much more than we sell, we shall come to be poor <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anders.</HI> HIST. COM. I.186.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Some apologise for luxury as serving to promote arts and taste. On the contrary, <HI>Polybius,</HI> speaking of the ignorance of <HI>Mummius,</HI> casts a reflection on the arts, as
<PB N="64" REF="013851_1088_0F9E2D77D0B530F0">
if taste made people extravagant and dishonest. But he might as well say, we ought not to love women, be|cause that passion often hurries us into folly and vice. It is not too much taste, but too little prudence and vir|tue, that produces degeneracy in a people. The truth is, it is only <HI>occasionally,</HI> not necessarily, that com|merce, arts, and taste do harm. And the same spend-thrift, who in a polished age and country breaks for half a million, would, in a time and place of less culti|vation and less ostentation, have broke for 10,000l.</P>
<P><HI>Montague</HI> observes, that the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> though enriched by commerce, were not effeminated by it <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">ANT. REP. p. 338.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Riches do not <HI>necessarily</HI> enervate a people, unless there be a relaxation of discipline, and degeneracy of manners. The <HI>Florentines,</HI> (though they had been at war 50 years, with almost all the states of <HI>Italy,</HI> and several powerful princes) were
<Q>by means of their ex|tensive commerce, encouragement of ingenious arts, <HI>strictness</HI> of <HI>discipline,</HI> and <HI>regularity</HI> of <HI>government,</HI> prodigiously rich; and their riches, far from ener|vating them, inspired them with ideas of rivalling the old <HI>Romans,</HI> not only in sentiments, but in power <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">MOD.

In the time of their war with <HI>Scaliger</HI> prince of <HI>Ve|rona,</HI> they were cultivating the arts of peace at home. <HI>Giotto,</HI> a famous architect and painter, worked at this time in <HI>Florence</HI>; and built the square tower of <HI>Flo|rence,</HI> said to be 144 ells high <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 101.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The <HI>Athenians</HI> were but clumsy artists, while they were a free people. They did not take to the fine arts, till they lost their liberties.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> are thought to excel us as much in painting, statuary, engraving, and some other ele|gencies, as they fall short of us in freedom. It must be confessed, that we have carried music and poetry much farther, than they.</P>
<P>It has often been said, that liberty encourages the arts, and that slavery depresses them. And it is cer|tain, that men, whose minds are debased and dispirited by actual cruelty exercised against them by their so|vereign, are not likely to enjoy that tranquil mind, which is so necessary for the free play of imagination.</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, there is generally found, in a free people, a certain ferocity, (the very cause of their being free; for kings and ministers are always ready to enslave all who will permit them) which fe|rocity is scarcely consistent with the turn of mind that is necessary for a proficient in the elegant arts. Add, that a certain degree of luxury, the forerunner of slavery, is necessary for the support of the fine arts.</P>
<P>In our times the rapacity for riches is got to an un|exampled height. We have not, like the <HI>Romans</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">ANT. UNIV. HIST. XII.54.</NOTE>, a temple dedicated to <HI>Iuno Moneta</HI>; but every man and every woman seems to have erected a temple to money in their hearts. Not that hoarding is the vice of the times. But the case is worse. For the voracity of those who disgorge their money as fast as they swal|low it, is the most insatiable. Like the gluttons saty|rized

<P>The <HI>English</HI> are probably the most luxurious people now in the world; and the <HI>English</HI> are the most given to suicide of any people now in the world. Does not this remarkable coincidence give ground to pre|sume, that there is a connexion between luxury and self-murder? That a people enslaving themselves to luxury, grow extravagant and expensive in their liv|ing; and, not being able to bear the expence of their way of living, and growing effeminate, impotent, and impatient of disappointment, they suffer despair to hurry them into the crime, which admits of no re|pentance or reformation. Ought not then every wise and good government to suppress luxury? Ought not every individual to set up an example against it?</P>
<P>Wherever luxury has prevailed, it may be traced by its mischievous effects.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ionians</HI> were once as valiant as the other <HI>Greeks.</HI> But they degenerated through luxury, the ruin of all bravery and public virtue. <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> says, the <HI>Crotonians</HI> loved the Olympic games, the <HI>Spartans</HI> fine armour, the <HI>Cretans</HI> hunting, the <HI>Sybarites</HI> dressing, and the <HI>Ionians</HI> lascivious dances. The <HI>Ionians</HI> ac|cordingly joined <HI>Xerxes</HI> against their countrymen the <HI>Athenians.</HI> It is true, after they saw themselves taken to task by <HI>Themistocles,</HI> they deserted the <HI>Persians,</HI> and

<P><Q>If we connect the various strokes interspersed through what we have remaining of the writings of
<PB N="69" REF="013851_1093_0F9E2D7BCFA50140">
<HI>Salust,</HI> which he levelled at the vices of his country|men, we shall be able to form a just idea of the man|ners of the <HI>Romans</HI> in the time of that historian. From the picture thus faithfully exhibited, we must be convinced, that not only those shocking calamities, which the republic suffered during the contest between <HI>Marius</HI> and <HI>Sylla,</HI> but those subsequent and more fa|tal evils, which brought on the utter extinction of the <HI>Roman</HI> liberty and constitution, were the natural ef|fects of that foreign luxury, which first introduced venality and corruption. Though the introduction of luxury from <HI>Asia</HI> preceded the ruin of <HI>Carthage</HI> in point of time, yet as <HI>Salust</HI> informs us, the dread of that dangerous rival restrained the <HI>Romans</HI> within the bounds of decency and order. But as soon as ever that obstacle was removed, they gave a full scope to their ungoverned passions. The change in their manners was not gradual, and by little and little, as before, but rapid and instantaneous. Religion, justice, modesty, decency, all regard for divine or human laws, were swept away at once by the irre|sistible torrent of corruption. The nobility strained the privileges annexed to their dignity, and the peo|ple their liberty, alike into the most unbounded li|centiousness. Every one made the dictate of his own lawless will, his only rule of action. Public virtue, and the love of their country, which had raised the <HI>Romans</HI> to the empire of the universe, were extinct. Money, which alone could enable them to gratify their darling luxury, was substituted in their place. Power, dominion, honours, and universal respect were annexed to the possession of money. Con|tempt, and whatever was most reproachful, was the bitter portion of poverty; and to be poor&punc; grew to be the greatest of all crimes, in the estimation of
<PB N="70" REF="013851_1094_0F9E2D7C4B540E10">
the <HI>Romans.</HI> Thus wealth and poverty contributed alike to the ruin of the republic. The rich employed their wealth in the acquisition of power, and their power in every kind of oppression, and rapine for the acquisition of more wealth. The poor, now dissolute and desperate, were ready to engage in every sedi|tious insurrection, which promised them the plunder of the rich, and set up both their liberty and coun|try to sale, to the best bidder. The republic, which was the common prey to both, was thus rent to pieces between the contending parties. As an uni|versal selfishness is the genuine effect of universal luxury, so the natural effect of selfishness is to break through every tie, both divine and human, and to stick at no kind of excesses in the pursuit of wealth, its favourite object. Thus the effects of selfishness will naturally appear in irreligion, breach of faith, perjury, a contempt of all the social duties, extor|tion, frauds in our dealings, pride, cruelty, univer|sal venality and corruption. From selfishness arises that vicious ambition, if I may be allowed the term, which <HI>Salust</HI> rightly defines, the lust of domination. Ambition is a passion which precedes avarice; for the seeds of ambition seem almost to be innate. The desire of pre-eminence, the fondness for being di|stinguished above the rest of our fellow creatures, attends us from the cradle to the grave. Though as it takes its complexion, so it receives its denomination from the different objects it pursues, which in all are but the different means of attaining the same end. But the lust of domination here mentioned by <HI>Salust,</HI> though generally confounded with ambition, is in reality a different passion, and is strictly speaking on|ly a different mode of selfishness. For the chief end which we propose by the lust of domination, is to
<PB N="71" REF="013851_1095_0F9E2D7FEE08CE28">
draw every thing to center in ourselves, which we think will enable us to gratify every other passion. I confess it may be alledged that self-love, and selfish|ness, both arise from the general law of self-preserva|tion, and are but different modes of the same prin|ciple. I acknowledge that if we examine strictly all those heroic instances of love, friendship, or pa|triotism, which seem to be carried to the most exalted degree of disinterestedness, we shall probably find the principle of self-love lurking at the bottom of many of them. But if we rightly define these two prin|ciples, we shall find an essential difference between our ideas of self-love and selfishness. Self-love, with|in its due bounds, is the practice of the great duty of self-preservation regulated by that law, which the great Author of our being has given for that very end. Self-love, therefore, is not only compatible with the most rigid practice of the social duties, but is in fact a great motive and incentive to the practice of all moral virtue. Whereas selfishness, by reducing every thing to the single point of private interest, a point which it never loses sight of, banishes all the social virtues, and is the first spring of action, which impells to all these disorders which are so fatal to mixed government in particular, and to society in general. From this poi|sonous source <HI>Salust</HI> deduces all those evils which spread the pestilence of corruption over the whole face of the republic, and changed the mildest and most upright government in the universe, into the most inhuman and most insupportable tyranny. For as the lust of domination can never possibly attain its end without the assistance of others, the man who is actuated by that destructive passion, must of necessity strive to attach himself to a set of men of similiar principles for the sub|bordinate instruments. This is the origin of all those
<PB N="72" REF="013851_1096_0F9E2D81523D5790">
iniquitous combinations which we call factions. To accomplish this, he must put on as many shapes as <HI>Proteus</HI>; he must ever wear the mask of dissimula|tion, and live a perpetual lie. He will court the friendship of every man, who is capable of promoting, and endeavour to crush every man who is capable of defeating his ambitious views. Thus his friendship and his enmity will be alike unreal, and easily con|vertible, if the change will serve his interest. As private interest is the only tie which can ever con|nect a faction, the lust of wealth, which was the cause of the lust of domination, will now become the effect, and must be proportionable to the sum total of the demands of the whole faction; and as the latter know no bounds, so the former will be alike insatiable. For when once a man is inured to bribes in the service of faction, he will expect to be paid as well for acting for, as for acting against the dictates of his con|science. A truth which every minister must have experienced, who has been supported by a faction, and which a late great minister, as he frankly con|fessed, found to be the case with him during his long adminstration. But how deeply soever a state may be immersed in luxury and corruption, yet the man who aims at being the head of a faction for the end of do|mination, will at first cloak his real design under an affected zeal for the service of the government. When he has established himself in power, and formed his party, all who support his measures will be re|warded as the friends; all who oppose him will be treated as enemies to the government. The honest and uncorrupt citizen will be hunted down, as disaffected, and all his remonstrances against mal-ad|ministration, will be represented as proceeding from that principle. The cant term <HI>disaffection,</HI> will be
<PB N="73" REF="013851_1097_0F9E2D818FA8BE48">
the watch-word of the faction; and the charge of disaffection, that constant resource of iniquitous mi|nisters, that infallible sign that a cause will not stand the test of a fair inquiry, will be perpetually employed by the tools of power to silence those objections which they want arguments to answer. The faction will esti|mate the worth of their leader, not by his services to his country; for the good of the public will be looked upon as obsolete and chimerical; but his ability to gratify or screen his friends; and crush his opponents. The leader will fix the implicit obedience to his will as the test of merit to his faction: consequently all the dignities and lucrative posts will be conferred upon persons of that stamp only, whilst honesty and public virtue will be standing marks of political reprobation. Common justice will be denied to the latter in all con|troverted elections, whilst the laws will be strained or over-ruled in favour of the former. Luxury is the certain forerunner of corruption, because it is the cer|tain parent of indigence: consequently a state so circumstanced will always furnish an ample supply of proper instruments for faction. For as luxury con|sists in an inordinate gratification of the sensual passions, the more the passions are indulged, they grow the more importunately craving, till the greatest for|tune must sink under their insatiable demands. Thus luxury necessarily produces corruption. For as wealth is essentially necessary to the support of luxury, wealth will be the universal object of desire in every state where luxury prevails: consequently, all those who have dissipated their private fortunes in the purchase of pleasure, will be ever ready to inlist in the cause of faction for the wages of corruption. A taste for pleasure immoderately indulged, quickly strengthens into habit, eradicates every principle of honour and
<PB N="74" REF="013851_1098_0F9E2D8250CC56B8">
virtue, and gets possession of the whole man. And the more expensive such a man is in his pleasures, the greater lengths he will run for the acquisition of wealth for the end of profusion. Thus the conta|gion will become so universal that nothing but an uncommon share of virtue can preserve the possessor from infection. For when once the idea of respect and homage is annexed to the possession of wealth alone, honour, probity, every virtue and every amiable quality will be held cheap in comparison, and looked upon as aukward and quite unfashionable. But as the spirit of liberty will yet exist in some degree, in a state which retains the name of freedom, even though the manners of that state should be generally depraved, an opposition will arise from those virtuous citizens who know the value of their birth-right, li|berty, and will never submit tamely to the chains of faction. Force then will be called in to the aid of corruption, and a standing army will be introduced. A military government will be established upon the ruins of the civil, and all commands and employ|ments will be disposed of at the arbitrary will of law|less power. The people will be fleeced to pay for their own fetters, and doomed, like the cattle, to unremitting toil and drugery, for the support of their tyrannical masters. Or if the outward form of civil government should be permitted to remain, the peo|ple will be compelled to give a sanction to tyranny by their own suffrages, and to elect oppressors instead of protectors. From this genuine portrait of the <HI>Roman</HI> manners, it is evident to a demonstration, that the fatal catastrophe of that republic, of which <HI>Salust</HI> himself was an eye-witness, was the natural effect of the corruption of their manners. It is equally as evident from our author and the rest of the <HI>Roman</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="013851_1099_0F9E2D83106C25B8">
historians, that the corruption of their manners was the natural effect of foreign luxury, introduced and supported by foreign wealth. The fatal tendency of these evils was too obvious to escape the notice of every sensible <HI>Roman,</HI> who had any regard for liberty and their antient constitution. Many sumptuary laws were made to restrain the various excesses of luxury; but these efforts were too feeble to check the over|bearing violence of the torrent. <HI>Cato</HI> proposed a severe law, enforced by the sanction of an oath, against bribery and corruption at elections; where the scan|dalous traffic of votes was established by custom, as at a public market. But as <HI>Plutarch</HI> observes, he in|curred the resentment of both parties by that salutary measure. The rich were his enemies, because they found themselves precluded from all pretensions to the highest dignities; as they had no other merit to plead but what arose from their superior wealth. The electors abused, cursed, and even pelted him, as the author of a law which deprived them of the wages of corruption, and reduced them to the necessity of sub|sisting by labour. But this law, if it really passed, had as little effect as any of the former; and like the same law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in our own country upon the same occasion, was either evaded by chicane or over-ruled by power. Our own septennial scenes of drunkenness, riot, bri|bery, and abandoned perjury, may serve to give an idea of the annual elections of the <HI>Romans</HI> in those abominable tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. Corruption was arrived at its last stage, and the depravity was universal. The whole body of the unhappy republic was infected and the distemper was incurable. For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hese excesses which formerly were esteemed the vices of the people, were now, by the force of custom fixed into a habit,
<PB N="76" REF="013851_1100_0F9E2D83FB508A30">
become the manners of the people. A most infallible criterion by which we may ascertain the very point of time when the ruin of any free state, which labours under these evils, may be naturally expected. The conspiracies of <HI>Catiline</HI> and <HI>Caesar</HI> against the liberty of their country, were but genuine effects of that cor|ruption which <HI>Salust</HI> has marked out as the imme|diate cause of the destruction of the republic. The end proposed by each of these bad men, and the means employed for that end, were the same in both. The difference in their success arose only from the differ|ence of address and abilities in the respective leaders. The followers of <HI>Catiline,</HI> as <HI>Salust</HI> informs us, were the most dissolute, the most profligate, and the most abandoned wretches, which could be culled out of the most populous and most corrupt city of the universe. <HI>Caesar,</HI> upon the same plan, formed his party, as we learn from <HI>Plutarch,</HI> out of the most infected and most corrupt members of the very same state. The vices of the times easily furnished a supply of proper instruments. To pilfer the public money, and to plunder the provinces by violence, though state crimes of the most heinous nature, were grown so familiar by custom, that they were looked upon as no more than mere office perquisites. The younger people who are ever most ripe for sedition and insurrection, were so corrupted by luxury, that they might be de|servedly termed an abandoned race, whose dissipation made it impracticable for them to keep their own private fortunes; and whose avarice would not suffer their citizens to enjoy the quiet possession of theirs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Though there is a concurrence of several causes which brings on the ruin of a state, yet, where luxury
<PB N="77" REF="013851_1101_0F9E2D87CC73CA38">
prevails, that parent of all our fantastic imaginary wants, ever craving and ever unsatisfied, we may justly assign it as the leading cause: since it ever was and ever will be the most baneful to public virtue. For as luxury is contagious from its very nature, it will gradually descend from the highest to the lowest ranks, till it has ultimately infected a whole people. The evils arising from luxury have not been peculiar to this or that nation; but equally fatal to all where|ever it was admitted. Political philosophy lays this down as a fundamental and incontestible maxim, that all the most flourishing states owed their ruin, sooner or later, to the effects of luxury; and all history, from the origin of mankind, confirms by this truth the evidence of facts, to the highest degree of demonstra|tion. In the great despotic monarchies it produced avarice, dissipation, rapaciousness, oppression, perpe|tual factions amongst the great, whilst each endea|voured to engross the favour of the Prince wholly to himself; venality, and a contempt for all law and discipline, both in the civil and military departments. Whilst the people, following the pernicious example of their superiors, contracted such a dastardly effe|minacy, joined to an utter inability to support the fatigues of war, as quickly threw them into the hands of the first resolute invader. Thus the <HI>Assyrian</HI> em|pire sunk under the arms of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> with his poor but hardy <HI>Persians.</HI> The extensive and opulent em|pire of <HI>Persia</HI> fell an easy conquest to <HI>Alexander,</HI> and a handful of <HI>Macedonians.</HI> And the <HI>Macedonian</HI> empire, when enervated by the luxury of <HI>Asia,</HI> was compelled to receive the yoke of the victorious <HI>Romans.</HI> Luxu|ry, when introduced into free states, and suffered to be diffused without controul through the body of the people, was ever productive of that degeneracy of
<PB N="78" REF="013851_1102_0F9E2D88A613A670">
manners which extinguishes public virtue, and puts a final period to liberty. For as the incessant demands of luxury quickly induced necessity, that necessity kept human invention perpetually on the rack, to find out ways and means to supply the demands of luxury. Hence the lower classes at first sold their suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ages in privacy and with caution; but as luxury increased, and the manners of the people grew daily more cor|rupt, they openly set them up to sale to the best bid|der. Hence too the ambitious amongst the higher classes, whose superior wealth was frequently their only qualifications, first purchased the most lucrative posts in the state by this infamous kind of traffic, and then maintained themselves in power by that additional fund for corruption, which their employ|ments supplied, till they had undone those they had first corrupted. But of all the antient republics, <HI>Rome,</HI> in the last period of her freedom, was the scene where all the inordinate passions of mankind operated most powerfully and with the greatest latitude. There we see luxury, ambition, faction, pride, revenge, selfishness, a total disregard to the public good, an universal dissoluteness of manners, first make them ripe for, and then complete their destruction.

<P>In the contest between <HI>Crassus</HI> and <HI>Pompey,</HI> we see the former catching the favour of the people by enter|taining them at 10,000 tables, and giving them largesses of corn. Well might it be pronounced, that the <HI>Roman</HI> spirit was on the decline, when such a base art was found successful. Very different were the times, when <HI>Curius Dentatus</HI> rejected the <HI>Samnite</HI> present of plate; or when the <HI>Roman</HI> ambassadors set the golden crowns, they had sent them by king <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> on the heads of his statues.</P>
<P>We see luxury gradually increasing and prevailing over the <HI>Roman</HI> spirit and virtue, till at length, in the imperial times, the contagion even reached ladies of the greatest distinction, who, in imitation of the prince and his court, had their assemblies and representations too, in a grove planted by <HI>Augustus,</HI> where booths were built, and in them sold, whatever incited to sen|suality and wantonness. Thus was even the outward appearance of virtue banished the city, and all manner of avowed lewdness, depravity, and dissoluteness, in|troduced in its room, men and women being engaged in a contention to outvye each other in glaring vices, and scenes of impurity. At length <HI>Nero</HI> could forbear no longer; but took the harp, and mounted the public stage, trying the strings with much attention, and care, and studying his part. About him stood his com|panions, and a cohort of the guards, with many tribunes and centurions, and <HI>Burrhus</HI> their commander, sad on this infamous occasion; but praising <HI>Nero,</HI> while he grieved for him.

<HI>Roman</HI> knights, entitled the knights of <HI>Augustus</HI>; young men distinguished by the bloom of their years, and strength of body, but all professed profligates.

<P><Q>The heat of the climate, the fruitfulness of the country, and the opportunity of supplying themselves by sea, with all the delights of <HI>Greece,</HI> sunk the <HI>Ta|rentines</HI> into idleness, and all the vices that attend it. Their whole life was spent in feasts, sports, and pub|lic entertainments. Buffoons and prostitutes go|verned the state at their pleasure, and often deter|mined the most important affairs by a joke, or an in|decent gesture. They bore a mortal hatred to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and dreaded their dominion, not so much out of fear of losing their liberty, as of being disturbed by that warlike and rough people, in the pursuit of their pleasures. They therefore employed all their <HI>Grecian</HI> subtilty, to draw such a number of enemies upon them, as still to keep them at distance from themselves, and this without appearing to be concerned.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Tarentines</HI> imagining that <HI>Rome</HI> having at last discovered their secret plots, had sent that fleet to punish them, they all, with one consent, ran down to the port, sell upon the <HI>Roman</HI> fleet with the fury of madmen, sunk one ship, and took four, the other five escaping. All the prisoners fit to bear arms,

were put to the sword, and the others sold for slaves to the best bidder. The <HI>Romans,</HI> upon the news of this act of hostility, sent a deputation to <HI>Tarentum,</HI> to demand satisfaction for the insult offered to the republic; but the <HI>Tarentines,</HI> instead of hearkening to their demands, insulted the ambassadors in the most outrageous manner. They admitted them to an au|dience in the theatre, where <HI>Posthumius,</HI> who was at the head of the embassy, and had been thrice consul, harrangued the assembly in <HI>Greek.</HI> His advanced age, his personal merit, and above all, the character of an ambassador, from a powerful people, ought to have gained him respect; but the <HI>Tarentines,</HI> heated with wine, not only gave no attention to his discourse, but burst into loud laughter, and impudently hissed him, whenever he dropped an improper expression, or pro|nounced a word with a foreign accent. Nor was this all. When he began to speak of reparation of injuries, they flew into a rage, and rather drove him out of the assembly, than dismissed him. As he was walking off with an air of gravity and dignity, which he preserved, notwithstanding the reception they gave him, a buffoon named <HI>Philonides,</HI> coming up to him, urined upon his robe; a new source of immoderate laughter to the mad and drunken multitude, who clapped their hands, applauding the outrageous inso|lence. <HI>Posthumius</HI> turning about to the assembly, shew|ed them the skirt of his garment so defiled; but when he found that this had no effect, but to increase the loudness of their contumelious mirth, he said with|out the least emotion, Laugh on <HI>Tarentines,</HI> laugh on now while you may; the time is coming when you will weep. It is not a little blood that must wash and purify this garment. This said, he withdrew
<PB N="82" REF="013851_1106_0F9E2D8C0C521D20">
left the city, and embarked for <HI>Rome.</HI> When the <HI>Tarentines</HI> came to themselves, and began to reflect on the enormity of their conduct, and at the same time, on the inability of their neighbours to defend them against so powerful a republic, they cast their eyes upon <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> king of <HI>Epirus,</HI> whose great repu|tation for valour and long experience in war, had gained him the reputation of one of the heroes of <HI>Greece.</HI> They therefore immediately dispatched ambassadors to him, but rather to found his disposition, and observe the situation of his affairs, than to enter without far|ther deliberation into any engagements with him. As <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> naturally loved action, and the bustle and hurry of war, the ambassadors found him in a dispo|sition to hearken to any proposal, which would furnish him with employment worthy of his ambition.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Meton,</HI> on the day that a public decree was to pass for inviting <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> to <HI>Tarentum,</HI> and when the peo|ple were all placed in the theatre, putting a withered garland on his head, and having a flambeau in his hand, as was the manner of the drunken debauchees, came dancing into the midst of the assembly, accom|panied by a woman playing on the flute. This silly sight was sufficient to divert the <HI>Tarentines</HI> from their most important deliberations. They made a ring and called out to <HI>Meton</HI> to sing, and to the woman to play; but when they expected to be entertained with a song, and were all silent, the wise citizen assuming an air of great seriousness, You do well <HI>Tarentines,</HI> said he, not to hinder those from diverting themselves, who are disposed to mirth; and if you are wise, you will yourselves take advantage of the present liberty you enjoy, to do the same. When <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> comes, you must change your way of life; your mirth and joy will be at an end. These words made an im|pression

<P><Q>The increasing regard with which men appear in the progress of commercial arts, to study their profit, or the delicacy with which they refine on their pleasures, even industry itself, or the habit of application to a tedious employment, in which no honours are won, may perhaps be considered as indications of a grow|ing attention to interest, or of effeminacy contracted in the enjoyment of ease and conveniency. Every successive art by which the individual is taught to improve on his fortune, is in reality an addition to his private engagements, and a new avocation of his mind from the public, Corruption however does not arise from the abuse of commercial arts alone; it re|quires the aid of political situation; and is not pro|duced by the objects that occupy a sordid and a mer|cenary spirit, without the aid of circumstances, that enable men to indulge in safety any mean disposition they have acquired. Providence has fitted mankind for the higher engagements, which they are some|times obliged to fulfil; and it is in the midst of such engagements, that they are most likely to acquire or to preserve their virtues. The habits of a vigorous mind are formed in contending with difficulties, not in engaging the repose of a pacific station; penetration and wisdom are the fruits of experience, not the lessons of retirement and leisure; ardour and gene|rosity are the qualities of a mind raised and animated in the conduct of scenes that engage the heart, not the gifts of reflection or knowledge. The mere in|termission of national and political efforts is, notwith|standing,
<PB N="86" REF="013851_1110_0F9E2D914D94DE20">
sometimes mistaken for public good; and there is no mistake more likely to foster the vices, or to flatter the weakness of feeble and interested men. If the ordinary arts of policy, or rather if a grow|ing indifference to objects of a public nature, should prevail, and under any free constitution, put an end to their disputes of party and silence, that noise of dissention which generally accompanies the exercise of freedom, we may venture to prognosticate corruption to the national manners, as well as remissness to the national spirit. The period is come, when no en|gagement remaining on the part of the public, pri|vate interest, and animal pleasure, become the sove|reign objects of care. When men being relieved from the pressure of great occasions, bestow their at|tention on trifles; and having carried what they are pleased to call sensibility and delicacy on the subject of ease or molestation, as far as real weakness or folly can go, have recourse to affectation, in order to en|hance the pretended demands, and accumulate the anxieties of a sickly fancy, and enfeebled mind. In this condition, mankind generally flatter their own imbecility under the name of politeness. They are persuaded, that the celebrated ardour, generosity and fortitude, of former ages bordered on frenzy, or were the mere effects of necessity on men, who had not the means of enjoying their ease or their plea|sure. They congratulate themselves on having escaped the storm, which required the exercise of such arduous virtues; and with that vanity which accom|panies the human race in their meanest condition, they boast of a scene of affectation of languor, or of folly, as the standard of human felicity, and as fur|nishing the properest erercise of a rational nature. It is one of the least menacing symptoms of an age,
<PB N="87" REF="013851_1111_0F9E2D9159C87E90">
prone to degeneracy, that the minds of men become perplexed in the discernment of merit, as much as the spirit becomes enfeebled in conduct, and the heart misled in the choice of its objects. The care of mere fortune is supposed to constitute wisdom; re|tirement from public affairs, and real indifference to mankind, receive the applause of moderation and virtue. Great fortitude and elevation of mind, have not always indeed been employed in the attainment of valuable ends; but they are always respectable, and they are always necessary when we would act for the good of mankind, in any of the more arduous stations of life. While therefore we blame their mis|application, we should beware of depreciating their va|lue. Men of a severe and sententious morality, have not always sufficiently observed this caution; nor have they been duly aware of the corruptions they flattered, by the satire they employed against what is aspiring and prominent in the character of the human soul.</Q></P>

When a people become slaves to their lusts, they are in the fairest train imaginable of becoming slaves to their neighbours. Politicians may for a time indeed ward off the blow; but how? Why, by making use of mercenary troops. Thus the cowardly spendthrift pays a bully to fight his quarrels, and when he pays him no longer, is beaten by him himself. This was the fate of the <HI>Persians</HI>; they hired <HI>Greek</HI> troops; maintained them in the exercise of their discipline; made them perfectly acquainted with their country and manners; suffered them to see and consider those errors in their government which made it, in spite of its grandeur, appear contemptible; and then these very <HI>Greeks,</HI> on their return home, were continually prompting their countrymen to go and pull down that empire, whose weight scarce permitted it to stand.

<P><Q>It may seem strange, that the <HI>Spartans,</HI> who had entertained such generous notions of liberty submitted patiently, for so long a tract of time, to the arbitrary commands of lawless tyrants; but this wonder will in a great measure be taken off, if we consider two things; first, that the manners of the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> were greatly corrupted; which is indeed the very basis of slavery. There can be no such thing as bending the necks of virtuous people; but when once men are abandoned to their vices, and become slaves to their passions, they readily stoop to those who can gratify them; and this was the case of the majority of the inhabitants of <HI>Sparta</HI> at this time. Secondly, those amongst them, who were distinguished by their merit and their morals, were, on this very account, proscribed by the tyrants, and hated by their creatures; so that they were forced to forsake their country, and
<PB N="90" REF="013851_1114_0F9E2D938EBB2610">
leave it to groan under a power, which they were un|able to resist. To this we may add, that such as were of mild dispositions, flattered themselves with the hopes of seeing better times; and even in these con|soled themselves with the thoughts, that <HI>Sparta</HI> yet retained her independency, and was not subjected by another state.</Q></P>
<P>What then avails civilisation? How are nations gainers by improving in arts and sciences, if they im|prove at the same time in all that is selfish, base, and sordid? Our untutored ancestors in the forests of <HI>Germany</HI> two thousand years ago, had a high relish for patriotism, liberty, and glory; of which we their improved posterity talk with contempt and ridicule <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Iul.

Their pride was to defend themselves a|gainst their enemies: ours to hire a mercenary army, who have only to turn their swords upon us, instead of our enemies, and we are their slaves. Their pride was, to shew themselves faithful, constant, and dis|interested, in serving their country: ours to fill our pockets with the spoils of our country, and then cry, It will hold my time.

<P><Q>I have represented particularly the great difference between the probabilities of human life in towns and
<PB N="91" REF="013851_1115_0F9E2D946EC10A38">
in country parishes; and from the facts I have recited, it appears, that the farther we go from, the artificial and irregular modes of living in great towns, the fewer of mankind die in the first stages of life, and the more in its last. The lower animals, except such as have been taken under human management, seem in general to enjoy the full period of existence allotted them, and to die chiefly of old age: and were any observations to be made among the savages, perhaps the same would be found to be true of them. Death is an evil to which the order of providence has subjected every inhabitant of this earth; but to man it has been rendered unspeakably more an evil than it was design|ed to be. The greatest part of that black catalogue of diseases which ravage human life, is the offspring of the tenderness, the luxu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and the corruptions in|troduced by the vices and false refinements of civil society. That delicacy which is injured by every breath of air, and that rottenness of constitution which is the effect of intemperance and debauchery, were never intended by the author of nature; and it is impossible that they should not lay the foundation of numberless sufferings, and terminate in premature and miserable deaths.&mdash;Let us then value more the simplicity and innocence of a life so agreeable to na|ture; and learn to consider nothing as savageness but malevolence, ignorance, and wickedness. The order of nature is wise and kind. In a conformity to it consists health and long life, grace, honour, virtue, and joy. But nature turned out of its way will always punish. The wicked shall not live out half their days. Cri|minal excesses embitter and cut short our present existence; and the highest authority has taught us to expect, that they will not only kill the body but the soul; and deprive it of an everlasting existence.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="013851_1116_0F9E2D95165F66D8">The same writer, in his 62d page, makes the fol|lowing observations:</P>
<P><Q>Calves are the only animals taken under our pecu|liar care immediately after birth; and in consequence of our administering to them the same sort of physic that is given to infants, and treating them in other respects in the same mnner, it is probable that more of them die soon after they are born than of all the other species of animals, which we see in the same circumstances. See THE COMPARATIVE VIEW OF THE STATE AND FACULTIES OF MAN WITH THOSE OF THE ANIMAL WORLD, p. 23. It is indeed melancholy to think of the havo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k among the human species by the unnatural customs, as well as the vices, which prevail in polished societies. I have no doubt but that the custom in particular of commit|ting infants, as soon as born, to the care of foster mo|thers, destroys more lives, than the sword, famine, and pestilence, put together. The ingenious and excellent writer quoted in the last note, observes, that the whole class of diseases which arise from catching cold, are found only among the civilized part of mankind, p. 51. And concerning that loss of all our higher powers, which often attends the decline of life, and which is often humiliating to human pride, he observes, That it exhibits a scene singular in nature and that there is greatest reason to believe that it proceeds from adventitious causes, and would not take place among us if we led natural lives.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the public Diversions, and of Gaming, and their Influence on Manners.</HEAD>
<P>FEW things have a more direct influence upon the manners of the people, than the public diversions, and gaming. Of the former, the chief are theatrical exhibitions, which ought to be very carefully attended to by the rulers of all states. Accordingly, when <HI>Solon</HI> observed with how much avidity the people listened to old <HI>Thespis</HI>'s mean com|positions, whose theatre was a cart, and who instead of giving out tickets at so much money each, was paid with a goat given by the neighbourhood or quar|ter where he had entertained the people, from whence the word Tragedy (a Goat-song) was derived; <HI>Solon,</HI> I say, when he observed how greedily the people listen|ed to <HI>Thespis</HI>'s low stuff, struck the ground with his staff, not without indignation, crying out, that he fore|saw that these trifling amusements would come to be matter of great importance in life. This was thorough|ly verified afterwards among both <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> insomuch that concerning the latter it was proverbially alledged, a <HI>Roman</HI> wanted nothing but bread and the
<PB N="99" REF="013851_1123_0F9E2D9D517CBAF8">
<HI>Circensian</HI> games. The theatre, with certain manage|ment, might undoubtedly be made a very powerful instrument for cultivating either virtue or vice in the minds of a people, as it exhibits an assemblage of what is most elegant in the fine arts, poetry, painting, music, speaking, action, &amp;c. and as the story is drawn from what is the most striking in history and in life. It is reckoned by some, that the first dramatic pieces were written and performed as acts of religion in honour of the gods. Our modern productions have, generally speaking, as little tincture of religion as can well be imagined. And yet I must observe, to the honour of the <HI>people,</HI> not the <HI>government</HI> of our times, that scarce any age ever deserved more praise on account of the decency and chastity of its theatrical compositions, and the behaviour of the actors and actresses upon the stage, than the present, if you except the female dancers, whose immodest curvetting in the air, and ex|posing of their limbs as they do, are both consummately ungraceful, as every female motion, that is not gentle, and soft, and tender, like the sex, must be; but like|wise shockingly offensive to modest eyes, and fatally alluring to those already familiarized to vice. This is an evil which merits reformation. But it will be much better corrected by the public disapprobation, than by law. We had a licenser of plays in the time of <HI>Walpole,</HI> but he only inquired, whether a new play was anti-ministerial or not. If it contained any satire on <HI>corruption,</HI> the <HI>index expurgatorius</HI> was ap|lied to it by the Lord Chamberlain without mercy. So wretchedly do ministers discharge their duty; so miserably do they fill their important station.</P>

<P>A very wise man said, he believed, <Q>if a man were permitted to make all the ballads, he need not care who made the laws of a nation.

<P>The <HI>Olympic</HI> games are to be looked upon in a very different light from all other public diversions, shows, &amp;c.

They kept up a laudable emulation to excel; for, a prize gained on account of the meanest accomplishment, as swiftness of foot, for instance, was a matter of great honour, as a man's being victor in that contest, supposed him to be a better runner than any other within the <HI>Olympian, Nemaean, Elean,</HI> or <HI>Isthmian</HI> circles. The contests were also useful for keeping up in the people a pleasure in manly and warlike exercises, which was absolutely

<P>The reader sees, that, though I have mentioned the entertainments of the theatre among those abuses of our times, of which this work exhibits a general survey; I have not absolutely condemned them: on the contrary, I have confessed the use, which a set of able statesmen might make of them in reforming and improving the manners of the people: the particulars of which I leave to be found and applied by men of wisdom and of public spirit.</P>
<P>The most fashionable of all diversions in our time, is masquerading; on which I have a few thoughts to offer.</P>
<P>Shame is the most powerful restraint from bad actions. To put on a mask is to put off shame. And what is a human character without shame?</P>
<P>It was observed long ago by the excellent <HI>Tillotson,</HI> on another account, that the people of <HI>England</HI> are but too tractable in imitating some of their worst neigh|bours in some of their worst customs. The <HI>French</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ught us masquerading, which has been an amuse|ment of that fantastical people ever since the days of <HI>Charles</HI> VI, if not earlier. For in his time there was exhibited a most dreadful scene of that kind, which, one would have expected to cool a little their eagerness for masquerades <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er after. The king and five of the court, on occasion of a marriage, disguised themselves like satyrs, by covering their naked bodies with linen
<PB N="104" REF="013851_1128_0F9E2DA398B706C0">
habits, close to their limbs, which habits were bedaub|ed with rosin, on which down was stuck. One of the company, in a frolick, running a light against one of them, as they were dancing in a ring, all the six were in|stantly enveloped with flames, and the whole company in a consternation, lest the fire should be communicated to all. Nothing was to be seen or heard but flames and screams. Four of the six died two days after, in cruel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and the King, who was subject to a weakness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, was overset by the fright, so that he was ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ter outrageous by fits, and incapable of government.</P>
<P>There are few entertainments more unmeaning, to say the least, than masquerades. For the whole <HI>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o|cent</HI> pleasure of them must consist in the ready and bril|liant wit of the masks, suitable to the characters they assume. But it cannot be supposed, that among a thousand people, there are fifty persons capable of entertaining by the readiness of their wit, and their judgment in sustaining assumed characters. Accord|ingly we hear of much stupidity played off on those oc|casions; and yet the rage after them continues. Wit must indeed be at a low ebb, when it is thought witty for a nobleman to assume at a masquerade the dress of a turkey-cock. This piece of wit, I am informed, was really exhibited at a late masquerade at Mrs <HI>Cornellys</HI>'s. As we know of nothing characteristical in a real turkey cock, but his gabbling, it is not easy to imagine what en|tertainment a man of quality should propose to give a company by assuming that character. If he had taken the likeness of a rook, he might have been a visible satire on gamesters, placemen, &amp;c. If that of an owl, he might have said he was a deep statesman; or if he chose a quadrupedal transformation, as that of an ass, for instance, or of a stag, a bull, or any of the horned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="105" REF="013851_1129_0F9E2DA4E403D940">
him, that he was their representative in parliament, &amp;c. Observing the frequency of violated marriage-beds of late years, and the frequent celebrations of masquerades, it requires a considerable stretch of cha|rity to avoid suspecting a connexion between masque|rading and intriguing, which may account for the eagerness shewn by the quality for that species of di|version, in direct opposition to the known disapproba|tion of both King and Queen; no great proof of polite|ness in our courtiers.</P>
<P><Q>Masquerades (says Mr. <HI>Gordon</HI> ^a) are a market for maidenheads and adultery, a dangerous luxury oppo|site to virtue and liberty.</Q> There was something like them formerly in the reigns of our worst Princes, by the name of masks. As the present reign resembles these in nothing else, so neither would I have it re|semble them in this. They were revived, or rather introduced, after the <HI>French</HI> way, by a foreign ambassa|dor, whose only errand then in <HI>England</HI> could be but to corrupt and enslave us, and for that end this mad and indecent diversion was practised and exhibited by him, as a popular engine to catch loose minds, or to make them so with great success. What good pur|pose they can serve now, I would be glad to know: The mischief of them is manifest both to public and private persons; a handle is taken from them to traduce some great characters, whom I would have always reverenced; and they are visibly on oppor|tunity and invitation to lewdness. If people will have amusements, let them have warrantable and de|cent ones; as to masquerades, they are so much the school of vice, that excepting a law to declare it innocent and safe, I question whether human inven|tion
<PB N="106" REF="013851_1130_0F9E2DA58DB264B8">
can contrive a more successful method of propa|gating it. The practice of the commonal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y is formed upon the example of the great, and what the latter do, the former think they may do. If a city wife has it in her head against her husband's inclinations, to take the pleasures of the masquerade, she has but to tell him, that my Lady Dutchess&mdash;is to be there (no doubt upon the same errand), and the poor, sober, saving man must submit, and be content to be in the class of his betters. From this source of prostitution, I fear many a worthy man takes to his arms a tainted and vicious wife, and finds in her a melancholy reason both, for himself and his posterity, to curse and detest masquerades and all those that encourage them.</P>

And why not those who frequent masquerades and <HI>Venetian</HI> balls? Surely your lordship cannot be a stranger to the frequent legal presentments, which, founded on the declared sense of all sober men, have stigmatized these dissolute assemblies with the severest

public censure; nor can you be ignorant, that <HI>Venetian</HI> balls, in their own native soil, exhibit on occasion, the most various scenes of exaggerated lewdness, which that most lewd and effeminate of all regions, <HI>Italy,</HI> can produce? Or did you, in the innocence of your heart, take it for granted, that our imitations of these balls were so purified by the presence of the greatest, as to make you fear the censure of uncharitableness, at least of indelicacy, had they been included in your black catalogue of sinful recreations? Who knows, my lord, that your courtly omission of this new imported diversion, has not been the means of sanctifying its further use; for the very next day after the expected earthquake, I observed one of these <HI>Ve|netian</HI> balls advertised in the public papers, as the first place for our affrighted countrymen to assemble and rejoice in after the dissipation of their fears.</Q></P>
<P>A certain late king was fond to distraction of masque|rading. And he set before his people another execra|ble example, viz. the violation of the matrimonial vow.</P>
<P>His present majesty, whom God preserve, has acted a contrary part in both respects. This, however, is no comparison between them as kings; but as men only; and I mention it merely to introduce the following anecdote, which ought to be kept in remembrance.</P>
<P>A grand masquerade was given out in the last reign for a certain evening. Some well-disposed persons, taking into consideration the mischievous tendency of those diversions, ordered hand-bills to be scattered about the streets, advising the ladies to keep at home; for that the people, displeased with the indecency of mas|querades, had determined to prevent any of the fair sex from going, and that there would probably be mob|bing and quarrelling in the streets. Whether there was any thing more in this, than that those gentleman
<PB N="108" REF="013851_1132_0F9E2DA70CFB74B0">
hoped to intimidate the ladies, and keep them at home, I never learned. But, rather than the court should lose the night's entertainment, a very great comman|der gave notice that he would order out a sufficient bo|dy of the military to keep the peace; so that the la|dies might go to the virtuous rendezvous without fear of interruption from the people. This was making our standing army useful.</P>
<P>At the marriage of <HI>Tamerlane</HI>'s grand-children, the people assembled were allowed, by the emperor's pro|clamation, to pursue whatever pleasures they thought fit, and no one was to hinder another. It is to be expected, that we shall soon have masquerades at Mrs.&mdash;'s established on this very foot <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">MOD. UNIV. HIST. VI.362.</NOTE>. The following paragraph gives an abridged account of a late celebration of that kind.</P>
<P><Q>Such a scene of ebriety was exhibited last mas|querade, and the behaviour of the women of the town, and of the bucks of dissipation, so shocking, it is hoped, the enormity of it will occasion the total abolition of those abandoned nightly orgies <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">WHITEHALL EVEN.

<P>We always begin our pretended reformations of man|ners at the wrong end.

<P>The oldest accounts we have of diversions bearing any resemblance to masquerades, and from whence the hint may have been taken, are perhaps, those of the nightly orgies upon mount <HI>Cithaeron,</HI> the mysteries of the <HI>Bona Dea,</HI> and the like, which were established in honour of sundry gods and goddesses. Their be|ing concealed under cloud of night, and the secrecy observed with respect to the transactions carried on in some of them, give them a suspicious air, which in|creases the resemblance which our masquerades bear to them. I wish some of our learned antiquaries would inquire, whether the <HI>Bona Dea</HI> was not an ancestor of our famous Mrs. <HI>Cornellys</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Let this page immortalize the genius of this wonderful outlandish old woman, who by dint of a knack she has at sticking up lamps a|gainst a wainscot, in the shape of fans, bodkins, scissars, and the like, and of ranging cakes and sugar-plums upon the shelves of a lacquered cupboard, has for several years so drained our nobility and gentry, that they cannot pay off their playhouse scores, their <HI>Newmarket</HI> scores, nor their milk scores. Her custom is to stick up her lamps, and range her cakes in a certain set of shapes, (very fine, you may be sure) and next day after she has drawn toge|ther all the people of taste to see them, at the expence of 20,000<HI>l.</HI> she asks pardon in the news-papers, that her show was not so fine as it ought to have been, and humbly begs the favour of their lordships and ladyships to come such a night, and they shall see what they shall see. They all go accordingly, over and over as often as she changes her lamps and her cakes, as it costs them nothing but their expences; and the outlandish old woman acts the part of the money-taker, and sweeps together the guineas. But, whatever may be the matter, whether her oeconomy is bad, or that money gotten in such a way does not wear well, she not only sends many to the spunging-house, but is often obliged to take a night's lodging there herself.</P>

<P>As to gaming, I cannot say, that ever I have heard a tolerable apology for it upon the score of morality, or common honesty. Is it not literally obtaining mo|ney upon false pretences, and without a <HI>valuable</HI> consi|deration, when I draw 100 guineas out of my neigh|bour's pocket, for which I give him nothing, but vex|ation and repentance?

This is exclusive of the loss of time, the inflaming of passion, often producing quarrels and murders, the endangering of chastity, (for it is alledged, that the la|dies do often pay with their persons what they cannot with their purses) the destruction of fortunes, often end|ing in d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">spair and self-murder. It is strange, that our nobility and gentry cannot be diverted at a rate some|what cheaper than all this. How can a person of qua|lity bear to think of himself as guilty of what would send him to <HI>Newgate,</HI> if he were not above law? No|bility of rank ought to suggest the necessity of <HI>acting</HI> in a <HI>noble</HI> manner. The man is what his <HI>actions</HI> (not his <HI>birth</HI> and <HI>rank</HI>) make him. A man of noble birth acting in a mean and sordid manner, is only the <HI>more</HI> mean and sordid, because he sinks below what was to have been <HI>expected</HI> of him. Add, that the vices of a person of rank are incomparably more criminal than those of the common people; because his example draws the multitude into guilt, and he becomes answer|able for their offences. Our nobility and gentry, so far from attending to these considerations, are the great leaders of the people into this ruinous vice. Besides, the example they exhibit of an endless attachment to carding, rocking, cocking, racing, pitting, gambling, jobbing, they have introduced gaming into their system of politics, and a pack of cards is become an engine powerful enough to overthrow a kingdom.</P>
<P>An anonymous speaker in the House of Commons. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1754, on occasion of a lottery proposed by the ministry, argued as follows:</P>
<P><Q>The mortal disease of the present generation is well known to be the love of gaming; a desire to emerge into sudden riches; a disposition to stake the future against the present, and commit their fortunes, them|selves, and their posterity to chance.</Q> The conse|quence
<PB N="113" REF="013851_1137_0F9E2DAACCC78BA0">
of this pernicious passion is hourly seen in the distress of individuals, the ruin of families, the ex|travagance and luxury of the successful, and rage and fraud of them that miscarry; this therefore is the vice, at least one of the vices, against which the whole artillery of power should be employed. From gaming, the people should be dissuaded by instruction, withdrawn by example, and deterred by punishment. To game, whether with or without good fortune, should be made ignominious; he that grows rich by it ought to be deemed as a robber, and he that is im|poverished as a murderer of himself. Yet, what are the men entrusted with the administration of the pub|lic now proposing? What but to increase this lust of irregular acquisition, and to invite the whole nation to a practice which the laws condemn, which policy disapproves, and which morality abhors? For what is a lottery but a game? The persons, who risque their money in lotteries, are I believe for the most part the needy or extravagant; those whom misery makes ad|venturers, or expence makes greedy. And of these the needy are often ruined by their loss, and the lux|urious by their gain. He, whose little trade, industrious|ly pursued, would find bread for his family, diminishes his stock to buy a ticket, and waits with impa|tience for the hour which shall determine his lot; a blank destroys all his hopes, and he sinks at once into negligence and idleness. The spendthrift, if he miscarries, is not reclaimed; but if he succeeds, is confirmed in his extravagance, by finding that his wants, however multiplied, may be so easily supplied. It is universally allowed that reward should be given only to merit, and that as far as human power can provide, every man's condition should be regulated by his merit. This is the great end of established
<PB N="114" REF="013851_1138_0F9E2DAD95AA8240">
government, which lotteries seem purposely contrived to counteract. In a lottery the good and bad, the worthless and the valuable, the stupid and the wise, have all the same chance of profit. That wealth which ought only to be the reward of honest industry, will fall to the lot of the drone, whose whole merit is to pay his stake, and dream of his ticket.</P>
<P><Q>With indignation it was observed, that no less than two lotteries in one year, (<HI>A. D.</HI> 1763,) were now, for the first time, without any urgent necessity, to be established in the days of peace, to the encour|agement of the pernicious spirit of gaming, which cannot be too much discountenanced by every state that is governed by wisdom, and a regard for the morals of the people <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Speech in Parliament, Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. VI.198.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Gaming is so dreadful a vice (says Mr. <HI>Gordon</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">TRACTS, I.325.</NOTE>,) especially in those who are any way intrusted with our liberties, that I cannot pass it over in silence. A man who will venture his estate, will venture his country. He who is mad enough to commit his all to the chance of a dye, is like to prove but a faithless guar|dian of the public, in which he has perhaps no longer any stake. It is a jest, and something worse, in a man who flings away his fortune this way, to pretend any regard for the good of mankind. His actions give his words the lie. He sacrifices his own happi|ness, and that of his family and posterity to a sharper, or an amusement, and by doing it, shews that he is utterly destitute of common prudence, and natural affection; and on the contrary, an encourager and example of the most destructive corruption; and after all this, ridiculously talks of his zeal for his country, which consists in good sense and virtue, joined to a
<PB N="115" REF="013851_1139_0F9E2DAECFB0B940">
tenderness for one's fellow creatures. When he has wantonly reduced himself to a morsel of bread, he will be easily persuaded to forsake his wretchedness, and accept of a bribe. Who would trust their pro|perty with one who cannot keep his own? The same vicious imbecility of mind, which makes a man a fool to himself, will make him a knave to other people. So that this wicked proneness to play, which is only the impious art of undoing or being undone, cuts off every man who is possessed with it, from all pretence either to honesty or capacity. I doubt <HI>Eng|land</HI> has paid dear for such extravagances. A law-maker, who is at the same time a gamester, is a cha|racter big with absurdity and danger. I wish that in every member of either house, gaming were attended with expulsion and degradation; and in every officer, civil or military, with the loss of his place. A law enjoining this penalty would be effectual, and no other can.</Q></P>
<P>One of the greatest mischiefs of gaming is, that the gamester, like the dropsical patient, becomes more and more attached to it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of Duels.</HEAD>
<P>OUR laws forbid <HI>murder:</HI> our manners legitimate <HI>duelling.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="013851_1144_0F9E2DB29C025190">
<Q>In deliberate duelling, says the admirable <HI>Black|stone</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">COM. IV.129.</NOTE>, both parties meet avowedly with an intent to murder; thinking it their duty as gentlemen, and claiming it as their right, to wanton with their own lives, and those of their fellow-creatures, without any warrant or authority from any power, either divine or human, but in direct contradiction to the laws both of God and man; and therefore the law has justly fixed the crime and punishment of murder on them, and on their seconds. Yet it requires such a degree of passive valour to combat the dread of even unde|served contempt, arising from the false notions of ho|nour too generally received in <HI>Europe,</HI> that the strongest prohibitions and penalties will never be entirely effec|tual to eradicate this unhappy custom, till a method be found out of compelling the original aggressor, to make some other satisfaction to the affronted party, which the world shall esteem equally reputable as that which is now given at the hazard of the life and for|tune, as well of the person insulted, as of him, who hath given the insult.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>abb&eacute; S. Pierre</HI> insists <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">OEUVR. POLIT. VIII.240.</NOTE>, that
<Q>it is cruel and unjust to punish with loss of fortune and life an un|happy man, who cannot obey the law [that is, can|not refuse a challenge] without infamy and disgrace; as the law of nature, on the other hand, enjoins him never to dishonour himself, and to prefer death to infamy. <HI>Ie soutiens qu'il est cruel, &amp;c.</HI></Q>
The <HI>abb&eacute;</HI> therefore proposes, that there be a military aca|demy established, before which all differences between gentlemen, on points of honour, shall be decided.</P>
<P>The same author proposes <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. X.53.</NOTE> that a solemn oath be administered to every officer, on receiving his commis|sion,
<PB N="121" REF="013851_1145_0F9E2DB56A607AF0">
by which he should abjure duelling, and promise to discover all such designs among his acquaintance. Were duelling left off among officers, it would soon become unfashionable every where else. These are some of the advantages we gain by our standing army. They teach us, that it is polite to lie with other men's wives, to debauch innocent virgins, and to murder one another about points of honour.</P>
<P>Though challenging in consequence of an insult upon a person's honour, or what is so called, is a very antient custom, it is not easy to explain the <HI>reasonable|ness</HI> of the practice. A person has injured me. The laws of my country give me no redress. (A most scandalous deficiency on the part of government!) To endeavour to avenge myself, and to vindicate my vio|lated honour by an attack upon him, is natural, though not magnanimous, nor christian. But because a per|son has slightly injured me, am I to give him a chance for doing me an infinitely greater injury? Here, then, comes in, I suppose, the pretence, that a duel is an appeal to providence, as if it were certain, that provi|dence would give success to the party who has the right on his side. But who has told our duellists, that providence will certainly give success to him, who seeks to shed the blood of his fellow creature, <HI>cold,</HI> in defence of the virtue of a wh&mdash;or of the honour of a liar, or even in defence of the chastity of a really virtuous woman, or of the honour of him, who has spoken the truth? We know, that scripture represents the present as a state of discipline, not of retribution, and expressly warns us against rash conclusions con|cerning the different lots of men in this life. And where else our duellists should find their doctrine, of certain success to him who has the right on his side, I cannot imagine. For experience shews, that in duels
<PB N="122" REF="013851_1146_0F9E2DB6A49E8EB8">
the best swordsman, or best marksman has the best prospect of victory; as in war, generally speaking, the ablest general, and best appointed army, gain the victory.</P>
<P>The grand plea for duelling is, that he, who re|fuses a challenge, is presently set down for a coward. And who can bear to be thought a coward? But it is very easy to escape the imputation of cowardice, and yet refuse a challenge. A hot-headed young officer sends a challenge to a gentleman, no matter whether in the army or not. The gentleman directly refuses the challenge upon principle. The officer posts him for a coward. He posts the officer for a liar. The officer must not bear this. He attacks the gentleman. The gentleman defends himself, which he has a right to do against any ruffian. He, being cool, and the officer worked up to rage, it is natural to expect vic|tory to declare herself on his side in the scuffle. And as the officer must use no weapon, but a cane, unless the gentleman draws upon him, which he is not, by any law of honour, obliged to; there is no great dan|ger of murder on either side. And at the same time the gentleman's honour and courage are as effectually cleared before the public, as if he had fought the officer with twenty different mortal weapons.</P>
<P>Conquest in single combat is no more a proof, which party was in the right, than the old superstition of trial by fire ordeal, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It would not be cowardice in an officer to refuse to hazard his life, by going to sea in an open boat, by encountering a wild beast, &amp;c. for a sum of 20 or 30 guineas. Therefore it is not always cowardice in an officer to shew a due care for his life. If one officer owed another a large sum, and the debtor proposed to try by duel, whether he should pay it or not, who
<PB N="123" REF="013851_1147_0F9E2DB6D1E2E350">
would call the creditor a coward for refusing so ridi|culous a challenge <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>S. Pierre,</HI> OEUVR. POLIT. X.12.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>In the affair between lord <HI>Rea</HI> and <HI>Ramsay</HI> an officer, it was declared, that the sending of a challenge is a presumption of guilt <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">WHITEL. MEM. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The rule, that every man who refuses a challenge, must be a coward, is very disputable. A man may refuse a challenge, not because he fears his fellow-creature, or is afraid to die; but because he fears the Almighty, and does not chuse to hazard damnation for the sake of preserving the good opinion of the ladies.</P>
<P>This rule is of modern date. The antients did not pronounce every man a coward who refused a chal|lenge.</P>
<P>The antient <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> the models of cou|rage to all ages and nations, attached the idea of courage and cowardice to a man's readiness or reluctance to fight the enemies of his country, not to his shedding the blood of his countrymen. Highwaymen often shew great intrepidity.</P>
<P><HI>Pyrrhus</HI> challenged <HI>Antigonus</HI> to fight him for the kingdom of <HI>Macedon. Antigonus</HI> declined the chal|lenge. Yet we do not find the antients have branded <HI>Antigonus</HI> for a coward.</P>

<P>The Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> challenged <HI>Henry</HI> to single combat, or with 100 knights each side. <HI>Henry</HI> an|swers, that he cannot as a king accept a challenge from any subject; but that a time might probably come,
<PB N="124" REF="013851_1148_0F9E2DB794853838">
when they might measure swords in battle. The Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> sends a bitter answer, calling <HI>Henry</HI> trai|tor, usurper, and murderer of his king. <HI>Henry,</HI> in return, gives him the lie in form; and charges him with sorcery, by which he had thrown his father, the <HI>French</HI> king, into his present distemper. <HI>Henry</HI> complains to the ambassador, but in vain <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rap.</HI> I.493.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><HI>Francis</HI>'s sending <HI>Charles</HI> V. a challenge <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Roberts:</HI> CH.

Therefore those who did accept challenges, did not imitate the Emperor; nor did the example of that affair render it necessary to accept challenges; for the hot-brained fools saw, that the Emperor was not reckoned a coward, though he declined.</P>

<P>Among the <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Chinese,</HI> and the <HI>Persians,</HI> it is no disgrace for an officer to refuse a challenge, and to submit the punishment of any one who has insulted him, to his superior. On the contrary, his regula|rity of conduct, and his prudence are honoured. <HI>Nul officier n' est deshonore,</HI> &amp;c <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">S. <HI>Pierre,</HI> OEUVR. POLIT. X.8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Czarina</HI> thinks all deliberate offences ought to be punishable by law, from treason down to the slightest injury or affront to an individual <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Instr.</HI> 128.</NOTE>. If that were the case, there would be no pretence for duels, as now there is. And therefore that when a duel is fought, the challenger only, and not the accepter, ought to be punished; because the latter was through fear of shame forced to do what he knew to be un|justifiable, and is therefore pitiable <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 130.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The great and good Duke <HI>de Sully,</HI> who had as just notions of the point of honour as any of our modern heroes, who are daily fighting duels, has declared himself very strongly against this practice, as incon|sistent with civilisation, decency, humanity, and all the laws of God and man. He even reflects with some severity on the remissness of his patriot King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. in neglecting to enforce the laws already standing, or to promote the framing of others more promissing of success.</P>
<P><HI>Beccaria,</HI> p. 38, 39, thinks death an absurd punish|ment for duelling, because they that will fight, shew that they do not fear death. He thinks the aggressor should be punished, and the defendant acquitted, be|cause the law does not sufficiently secure his honour,
<PB N="126" REF="013851_1150_0F9E2DB98B0AF338">
and leaves him in a state of nature to defend it by him|self. But ought not then the law rather to be amend|ed, and duelling rendered altogether inexcusable?</P>
<P>Supposing proper provision made by law for check|ing petulancy, giving satisfaction for affronts, and de|ciding all matters of honour, it would not be amiss to bring in every giver and receiver of a challenge, though no blood has been spilt, lunatic, to send him by authority to Bedlam for life, and give his estate, real and personal, to his heir.</P>
<P>Duelling was originally an appeal to Heaven. It is highly absurd in our times, when nobody thinks of Heaven, and especially as it is commonly practised by those who set Heaven at defiance <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">ANT. UNIV. HIST. XVIII.492.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Duels are supposed to have received their first esta|blishment by a positive <HI>law</HI> (the practice is immemo|rial), from <HI>Gundebald</HI> King of the <HI>Burgundians, A. D.</HI> 501. See his edict <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. XIX.435.</NOTE>. His design seems to have been, to put a check to perjury. For he supposed, that obliging all persons to defend with their sword<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> what they had sworn, would make them more care|ful what oaths they took. But in this he shewed himself no great reasoner. For the natural effect of this law was, to put all people on learning the sword.</P>

<P><Q>For the trial by camp-fight, the accuser was with the peril of his own body to prove the accused guilty,
<PB N="127" REF="013851_1151_0F9E2DBE21F6FDF8">
and by offering him his glove, to challenge him to this trial, which the other must either accept of, or else acknowledge himself culpable of the crime whereof he was accused. If it were a crime deserving death, then was the camp-fight for life and death, and either on horseback or on foot. If the offence deserved prisonment, and not death, then was the camp-fight accomplished, when the one had subdued the other, by making him to yield, or unable to defend himself, and so be taken prisoner. The accused had the liberty to chuse another in his stead; but the accuser must perform it in his own person, and with equality of weapons. No women were admitted to behold it&punc; nor no men children under the age of thirteen years. The priests and people that were spectators did si|lently pray that the victory might fall unto the guilt|less; and if the fight were for life or death, a bier stood ready to carry away the dead body of him who should be slain. None of the people might cry, shriek out, make any noise, or give any sign whatso|ever; and hereunto at <HI>Hall</HI> in <HI>Swevia</HI> (a place ap|pointed for camp-fight) was so great regard taken, that the executioner stood beside the judges, ready with an ax, to cut off the right hand and left foot of the party so offending. He that (being wounded) did yield himself, was at the mercy of the other to be killed or to be let live. If he were slain, then he was carried away and honourably buried; and he that slew him reputed more honourable than before: but if being overcome, he were left alive, then was he by sentence of the judges, declared utterly void of all honest reputation; and never to ride on horseback, nor to carry arms.</Q></P>

<P>Duels were got to such a height in <HI>France,</HI> that 4000 gentlemen in a year fell by them. Laws were made against that destructive practice, which restrained it in some measure.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of Lewdness.</HEAD>
<P>UNDER the head of MANNERS, I could not avoid making some remarks on this most epi|demical vice.</P>
<P>The breach of the most awful vows, the debauch|ing of a virtuous wife, the destruction of a family's peace for life, the introduction of a bastard instead of the lawful heir to an ample estate, the provocation of an injured husband to that rage which no husband can promise to restrain, the hazard of murder and of damnation&mdash;these are what we of this elegant eighteenth century call gallantry, taste, the <HI>bon t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> knowledge of the world, <HI>s&ccedil;avoir vivre,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>No statesman will look with an indifferent eye on the prevalency of lewdness in his country, if he has any regard for his country, and knows that this vice is not less mischievous by debasing the minds, than by enervating and poisoning the bodies of the sub|jects. A people weakened by the foul disease, are neither fit for sea nor land service, for agriculture, manufactures, nor population.</P>
<P>It is notorious, as above hinted, that a certain late reign exhibited from the throne a very gross example

Is it not then manifest, that every man who is guilty of lewdness is self-convicted, of doing that by others which he will not bear at the hand of any other? This is acting directly contrary to the golden rule, which all nations have adopted, viz.

<PB N="140" REF="013851_1164_0F9E2DCB315B8750">
at what a rate a rich virtuoso, or a person of taste, would value a pair of gloves made of the hide of a lady of quality, or a blood royal hide. They must indeed be much more beautiful than the finest <HI>French</HI> kid. I know not whether a pin-cushion made of such rich stuff, might not fetch 100 guineas. And a hide of any size would make a great many pin-cushions. It is true, the frequency of adultery a|mong us would bring to the market a prodigious glut of the article. But our engrossers of corn would pre|sently shew us the way of keeping up the price, not|withstanding the plenty of the commodity. I am likewise aware of another obvious objection to my project, viz. That hides of rank are generally liable to be tender, occasioned by a polite malady very epi|demical among the great, which would render the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ufacturing of them difficult.

<P>When it was proposed to punish adultery with death, a gentleman observed, that such a law would only make people commit the crime with greater secrecy. But even with this view, such a law would be useful. For open vice is more atrocious than secret, and more mischievous by its example. It is a great evil for a people to be accustomed to hear often of gross crimes committed among them. It familiarises them to vice, and hardens them against the horror which every well disposed mind should have at wickedness. Wise statesmen will therefore endeavour to keep up an out|ward appearance of decency in the practice of the people.

<P>One great cause of the gross debauchery of our times, is the putting off of marriage to so late a period in life, because our gentlemen must, when they set up housekeeping, live in a certain taste, and all are striving to outvie one another in splendor and expence.

But while our gentlemen are going on in this course of debauchery, their sentiments with respect to the fair sex become gross and sordid; and they come at last to look upon womankind as merely objects of lust, and every handsome woman, married or single, is an object of lust.</P>

<P>In <HI>Spain,</HI> according to <HI>Baretti,</HI> if a young woman is debauched, the man, whom she charges as the au|thor of her disgrace, is by law obliged to marry her, or go to prison, and to suffer endless vexation.</P>
<P>In respect of seduction, our law leaves us quite lawless. A rape is death. But is not the injury to me the same in the end, whether my daughter is se|duced into the arms of a whoremaster, or forced? Of the two, seduction is on some accounts a greater injury than force. A young woman deflowered by main force may still be considered as undefiled in mind; whereas she who yields, must be accounted in some degree guilty. And as the law has left us in a state of nature, with respect to the seduction of our daughters, I own, I should be inclinable to take into my own hands the punishment of the man who had ruined a daughter of mine: For I should think he had done her and me as great an injury, in some re|spects

a greater, than if he had murdered her. And if I were upon a jury to try a father, who had killed the seducer of his innocent daughter, I should cer|tainly not bring him in guilty of murder.</P>
<P>To the disgrace of the present century, a miscreant lord decoyed an innocent young milliner of the city from her family under pretence of business; confined her several days in his own house; terrified her into compliance with his villanous desires; and was accus|ed of a rape, and punished, with&mdash;a hearty fright: for he knew he deserved the death of a ravisher. But it could not legally be brought in a rape. I should be glad to understand what difference it made to the injured young woman, to her father, or to the young man who courted her, whether she was put into the ruffian's bed by force, or terrified by threats; or whe|ther one proceeding, or the other, argued the greatest malignity, and deserved the severest punishment.</P>
<P><Q>There was (says Chancellor <HI>Bacon</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PARL. HIST.

<P>It is certainly not sound policy to suffer what may make the matrimonial tie seem less binding; and yet married women ought to be protected against the bru|tality of surly husbands. In this our police is miser|ably deficient. There ought to be a court for such causes. And yet I think nothing less than infidelity, or danger of life, can warrant a separation; nor can even those offences (in my opinion) justify a divorced person in marrying again; the vows being absolute, not conditional. A husband or wife, with whom one cannot live, is a misfortune; but does not, I think, void the matrimonial vow. Besides, it is to be con|sidered, that allowing separated persons to marry a|gain is giving them another temptation to separate.</P>
<P>It is the interest of almost every man and woman in <HI>England</HI> that street-walkers be suppressed, and lewd women confined to some obscure parts of great towns. Our ancestors thought it necessary to licence public stews, for fear of violence from sailors, and other de|bauched people, upon their wives and daughters. But there is no occasion for suffering the main thorough-fares of towns to be invested with those women, to the destruction of all sense of modesty, the discourage|ment of marriage, and drawing away into vicious courses the younger part of the male sex. And it is

<P>Marriage is often kept back in <HI>England</HI> by gentle|men's going abroad upon their travels.

<P>No nobleman, or gentleman, ought to travel, if improvement be his object, till the heat of youth be over; and as every nobleman and gentleman of for|tune can afford to marry young, they may travel with their ladies along with them.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Influence of Education upon Manners.</HEAD>
<P>IT is observed above, that among the antient <HI>Spar|tans</HI> there was no such crime as infidelity to the marriage-bed; and that <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> in framing his laws, had used no precaution against it, but the virtuous and temperate education he prescribed for the youth of both sexes.</P>
<P>And indeed the influence which education has upon the manners of a people is so considerable, that it is not to be estimated. But by education it is to be observed, we must understand not only what is taught at schools and universities, but the impressions young people receive from parents, and from the world, which greatly outweigh all that can be done by masters and tutors. Education, taken in this en|larged sense, is almost all that makes the difference between the characters of nations; and it is a severe satire on our times, that the world makes most young men very different beings from what their educators intended they should be.</P>
<P>The difference between the behaviour of the grave and regular Quakers, even in youth, and that of all other sects among us, which is brought about chiefly by the management of parents, shews what is in the power of parents. The Quakers hold frugality and industry for religious duties. They accordingly thrive better, and people more than other sects. See an ex|communication and separation of <HI>Iohn Merrick,</HI> a

<P>The authors of the ANTIENT UNIVERSAL HIS|TORY celebrate the wisdom of the <HI>Persians,</HI> in respect to education, as follows: <Q>As to their laws, [the <HI>Per|sian</HI>] they are greatly commended by <HI>Xenophon,</HI> who prefers them to those of any other nation whatsoever, and observes that other law-givers only appointed punishments for crimes committed; but did not take sufficient care to prevent men from committing them; whereas the main design of the <HI>Persian</HI> laws was to inspire men with a love of virtue, and abhorrence of vice, so as to avoid the one, and pursue the other, without regarding either punishment or reward: to attain this end, parents, were not, by their laws, allowed to give their children what education they pleased; but were obliged to send them to public schools, where they were educated with great care, and never suffered, till they had attained the age of seventeen, to return home to their parents. These schools were not trusted to the care of com|mon mercenary masters, but were governed by men of the first quality, and best characters, who taught them by their example the practice of all virtues; for these schools were not designed for learning of sci|ences, but practising of virtue. The youths were allowed no other food, but bread and cresses, no other drink but water, at least from the age of seven to seventeen. Those who had not been educated in these schools, were excluded from all honours and preferments <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">ANT. UNIV. HIST. V.136.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P><HI>Hormouz</HI> king of <HI>Persia</HI> had by nature a bad disposi|tion; but <HI>Buzurge Mihir,</HI> his tutor, 'took such pains with him, and knew so well how to set folly and vice in their true lights, that he vanquished his na|tural proneness to evil, and made him, in spite of him|self, a great and good man. For the first three years of his reign, while his old tutor remained about his person, he as far transcended <HI>Nouschirvan,</HI> as <HI>Nous|chirvan</HI> did all his predecessors. His discourses were fraught with wisdom. His actions were all benefi|cent. He carried his respect for his tutor so far, that he would not wear his regal ornaments in his presence. And when some of the courtiers inti|mated, that his reverence to him was excessive, since it was more than was due to a parent; he answered, <HI>You say well, my friends. But I owe more to him, than I do to my father. The life and kingdom, I received from him, will remain with me but a few years; but the reputation I shall acquire in virtue of my tutor's in|structions, will survive to the latest times.</HI> Happy had it been for this prince, had he always adhered to these notions. But when old age had rendered <HI>Buzurge Mihir</HI> unfit for the great employment he held, he re|quested, and obtained, leave to retire; and with him retired the happiness of his royal pupil. The young courtiers, who were about <HI>Hormouz,</HI> begun, from that moment to gain a visible ascendency over him, and to influence him to do many things alike inju|rious to his interest and his reputation. He after|wards
<PB N="153" REF="013851_1177_0F9E2D0A43F74DF8">
became such a tyrant, as to murder his subjects by thousands; the consequences of which proceed|ings were the hatred of his subjects; revolts; inva|sions; battles; and the deposition of <HI>Hormouz,</HI> and putting out of his eyes <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">MOD. UNIV. HIST. XI.186.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If education be of such consequence, it ought to be a great object with statesmen; so much the rather because the <HI>private</HI> educators of youth, who <HI>alone</HI> have it in their power to discharge, in any tolerable manner, that momentous trust, are but indifferently encouraged by those who employ them.</P>
<P>Educators of youth had formerly, in some coun|tries, the authority of ministers of state, being thought of equal consequence; and justly, says the author. Youth staid in the seminaries till fit to enter on pub|lic employments <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. XXXVIII.472.</NOTE>.

<PB N="154" REF="013851_1178_0F9E2D0A4E742260">
disgrace of our universities of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge.</HI> That a youth, by being placed at <HI>Leyden,</HI> or <HI>Utrecht,</HI> runs no other hazard, than that of perhaps acquiring a more studious turn, than what would be suitable to active stations in life. But that at our <HI>English</HI> universi|ties, a youth will acquire such a turn to extravagance, as will ruin all prudence and oeconomy in him for life. He adds,
<Q>the morals of the youth are incom|parably purer at the <HI>Dutch</HI> universities, than the <HI>English,</HI> which are little better than seminaries of vice.</Q></P>
<P>If statesmen understood rightly their proper function, they would apply a great part of their time and atten|tion to education, as a matter of great consequence toward forming right principles and manners in per|sons of rank, from whom the lower people receive theirs. Universities and public schools, especially those situated in great towns, seem to be a constitution incapable of proper regulation. The multitude of the youth assembled together, makes it unreasonable to expect other than dissipation and neglect of studies, if not vice and debauchery. They consider them|selves as (what they really are) formidable to their masters and governors, and they will obey only when they please. But, if we must speak the truth, the error begins earlier than schools and universities. In <HI>England</HI> parents encourage that in their sons, which they ought to suppress, and contrariwise. The most amiable, and most useful disposition in a young mind is diffidence of itself, a sense of its own insuf|ficiency, and consequent need of instruction and gui|dance, and a constant fear of offending. But we do all we can to rub off this lovely delicacy of sentiment, and to give our sons instead of it, a bold and fearless disposition, which naturally leads them to licentious|ness

go in conferring them. In poor countries, go|vernments have but little in their power, and in rich ones they give the honours and emoluments not to those who deserve them, but to those whom it suits them best to gratify; and then they exchange the name of rewards for that of bribes. It is therefore not necessary to say much of rewards. As to punish|ments, the most indispensable requisite is their being adequate. A murder committed with the sword of justice, is the most horrid phaenomenon in a state. And in all well-regulated states, the maxim,

<P>Another essential in punishments is, that they be cal|culated to deter offenders, and prevent farther trans|gression. For this is, in fact, the sole end of punish|ments. And if a sanction does nothing toward prevent|ing farther violation of the law, it is totally useless.</P>

<HI>Thom. Smith.</HI> DE REPUB. ANGL. Perhaps it is not strictly true, that there is <HI>no country</HI> in which fewer murders are committed, than in <HI>England.</HI> I imagine <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> are ex|ceptions; to mention no others. But be this as it will, it is certain that in no countries are atrocious crimes more frequent, than in those in which the pu|nishments are the most inhuman.</P>
<P>Let us hear Mr. <HI>Fazakerly</HI> on this subject, who spoke as follows in the house, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1744:</P>
<P><Q>Some people confess that forfeitures and confisca|tions, when annexed to capital punishments, are inconsistent with religious justice, and the spirit of our law; but these additional punishments, say they, are necessary for the preservation of government, and preventing conspiracies and civil wars. Did they ever do so in any country? Did the severity of the punishment ever prevent the frequency of the crime? Does breaking on the wheel prevent robberies in <HI>France?</HI> Do the punishments of treason prevent treasons and rebellions in <HI>Asia,</HI> where traitors are put to the most tormenting and cruel deaths, and their whole families destroyed? Sir, there is something in the nature of man that disdains to be terrified; and therefore severe punishments have never been found effectual for preventing any sort of crime. The most effectual way to prevent crimes is, to prevent the
<PB N="162" REF="013851_1186_0F9E2D14D1D01EA0">
temptation: if you would prevent thefts and robbe|ries, you must take care to have your people educated in virtuous principles, and every man brought up and enured to labour and industry, that has no estate to subsist on: if you would prevent treasons, you must do it by the mildness of your government, in order to prevent the ambitious from having any mat|ter to work on, or any prospect of success, and to prevent any number of men from being rendered desperate; for desperate men no laws can restrain, no punishment frighten; and no man ever yet conspired against a government, without some prospect of suc|cess. I am therefore fully convinced that punish|ments always promote, instead of preventing, con|spiracies and civil wars; and I have the experience of all ages, and all countries, for supporting my opinion. Nay, if we have any faith in providence, we must ex|pect that a government shall not go unpunished, which injures and oppresses the fatherless, the widow, and the orphan. These severe punishments upon treason, Sir, serve for nothing but to lull a government into a fatal and mistaken security, that no man will ven|ture to conspire or rebel against them. In arbitrary governments, this emboldens ministers to tyrannize over, and oppress the people; and in limited govern|ments it encourages them to encroach upon the liberties and privileges of the people. In both they continue their oppressions or encroachments, till the people are become generally discontented. Then some desperate, or some ambitious man sets fire to the train, and the ministers too often with their masters are blown up by the combustibles which they themselves have col|lected for their own destruction. It was to this cause chiefly, I am convinced, Sir, that we owed all the civil wars, and all the revolutions that have happened
<PB N="163" REF="013851_1187_0F9E2D15937AC160">
in this country almost ever since the conquest; and if we remove the cause, I may venture to prophesy, that both our civil wars and revolutions will be less frequent.</Q></P>

<P>It seems strange, that any nation wise enough to propose punishments, should propose any other punish|ment for every injury, than formal retaliation, where it can be inflicted. Why should he, who mangles an innocent person, in such a manner that he is three days in the pains of death, be neatly tucked up, and put out of pain in the time of pronouncing, one, two, three? A few years ago, a merciless monster in human shape, starved his wife to death, keeping her ti|ed with her hands behind her in constant anguish, for many weeks, if I rightly remember. He was only hanged; that is, he was punished, as if he had only stolen a sheep. This is not common sense. His guilt was as much beyond that of a sheep-stealer, as this globe of 25,000 miles round is larger than a hillock.</P>

<P>The shame of being punished ought always to be the principal part of an offender's punishment.

<P>The <HI>Czarina</HI> proposes <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 82.</NOTE> that all punishments flow naturally from the respective crimes. If this rule were observed, thieves and highwaymen would be punished with hard work and hard fare, because they became guilty through idleness and luxury.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Able Statesmen apply themselves to forming the Man|ners of the People.</HEAD>
<P>IF manners be, as we have seen, so essentially neces|sary to the safety of a State, no wise Prince, Mi|nister, or Statesman, will neglect attending to the general manners and morals. No part of the function of Statesmen is more honourable, none more useful, none more indispensable, than a due attention to the general manners of the people. If a wise and good man were to wish to be in a high station, it would be for the sake of being thus serviceable to his fellow-creatures. But a little knowledge of the world shews us, that grandees of all denominations, as Emperors, Kings, Grand-dukes, Popes, Cardinals, Peers, Arch|bishops,
<PB N="173" REF="013851_1197_0F9E2D1FDD2AE370">
Bishops, &amp;c. are great enemies to manners. Their height above the rest gives them an opportu|nity of daring, without fear of punishment, or almost of censure, to strike out from the limited path of vir|tue into the wilds of licentiousness; and the silliness of mankind, who admire a laced coat, whether it be a man or a monkey that wears it, leads them to imitate what reason teaches to abhor. There must be less of this in a well regulated republic, where all are nearly upon an equality, than in a monarchy, where the false glare of a court misleads the unthinking into the paths of ambition and corruption.</P>
<P>Do our great men consider how they expose them|selves in setting such an example before the public?</P>
<P>How absurd titles without corresponding characters!

<P>It is true, that mankind in general are a worthless and ungrateful set of beings, for a man to wear him|self out in serving.

My insignificant self? That would be sordid indeed. If I apply myself with diligence, I may do good to several. If I regard only my single self, I serve but <HI>one,</HI> and him, perhaps, one of the most indifferent of the set.</P>
<P>But it is not true, that there is nothing to be gained by public spirit, or lost by the want of it. For there is a very serious light in which this matter is to be viewed, viz. That we are all embarked on the same bottom; and if our country sinks, we must sink with it.</P>
<P>But suppose there were literally nothing to be got by serving our country, antiquity exhibits a multitude of examples of great and good men serving their coun|try without advantage, and in spite of unjust treatment. <HI>Phocion,</HI> though he had often commands in the army, was condemned to an undeserved death, and died poor, at a time when corruption was at a great height at <HI>Athens</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">ANT.

<P>No nation ever was very corrupt under a long con|tinued virtuous government, nor virtuous under a long continued vicious administration. Whether this coun|try is, and has long been very corrupt, let the reader determine, after he has impartially considered the con|tents of these volumes.</P>
<P>He who formed the human mind, and who therefore must be the best judge of the proper means for influ|encing it, has shewn us, that he judges those to be, the proposing of rewards and punishments, the former to act upon the hopes, and the latter upon the fears of our species. And though it be true, that beings, who attach themselves to a right course of action, and avoid the contrary, from motives of this kind, are less praise|worthy than those who love virtue and abhor vice for their own sakes merely, yet is it equally certain, that in this early state of moral discipline, no incentives more efficacious could have been found. What so likely to startle a mad miscreant, and stop him in his vicious career, as the denunciation of punishments both in this world and the next, those punishments to be inflicted by a hand that is omnipotent and irresist|ible. The disinterested love of virtue and hatred of vice must come afterwards.</P>
<P>As to moral character, mankind may be divided into three classes: 1. The meaner and more sordid, who are a great part of the species, whose minds, or the earthy substance they have instead of minds, are capa|ble of being drawn to decency <HI>only</HI> by the gross allure|ment of <HI>pecuniary</HI> rewards; and of being deterred from open wickedness <HI>only</HI> by the fear of prisons, fines, and corporal punishments. 2. The next rank above these,
<PB N="192" REF="013851_1216_0F9E2D32F3DD2538">
are persons of a nobler character, who are capable of great and good actions, when attended with fame and glory. 3. The highest, or those few of our species, who are more angels than men, are they, who love virtue for its own sake, without glory, and even with infamy and suffering, and who abhor vice though at|tended with profit, and surrounded with the false glare of honours, titles, and preferments. It is <HI>only</HI> with the first and second of these classes, that the statesman can have any thing to do. Those of the third are infi|nitely above his arts, and want neither allurements to virtue nor determents from vice; as they find both in the happy dispossitions of their own godlike minds.</P>

<Q>If philosophy will not suffice to bind the common people to their duty, what must be said of some mo|dern politicians who shew no desire of setting up mo|rality, and yet are pulling down revealed religion? Statesmen have been accused of being uncertain them|selves in religious points; but, till lately they were never seen to countenance in others such a looseness; and till of late years it was never known a recommen|dation to preferment. Would it any thing avail the public to have the settled opinions concerning divine matters quite altered by the law? If not, why do such as propose innovations in revealed religion, find so many open advocates, and those of the highest rank? How comes it to pass that the majority suffer them|selves to be guided, and often with hard reins, by a small number? Can it be imagined this is brought a|bout merely by a right disposition of power, whereby the weak come to hold the strong in their dominion? Or can it be thought that laws are sufficient to subject the bodies of men to government, unless something else did constrain their conscience and their minds? It is hardly to be doubted but that if the common people are once induced to lay aside religion, they will quickly cast off all fear of their rulers. But such as object against revealed religion, as it is now trans|mitted to us, have they another scheme ready? When they have pulled down the old frame, can they set up a better in its room? Most certainly by their own lives, either in private, or in relation to the public, they seem very unfit apostles to propagate a new be|lief. When the common people all of a sudden be|come corrupt, and by quicker steps than was ever known; when they do not revere the laws; when there is no mutual justice among them; when they defraud the prince; when they prostitute their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

in elections, it may be certainly concluded that such a country is by the artifice of some, and the negli|gence of others, set loose in the principles of religion. Nothing therefore can more conduce to correcting the manners of a depraved people, than a due care of religious matters; a right devotion to God will beget patience in national calamities, submission to the laws, obedience to the prince, love to one another, and a hatred to faction; and it will produce in the minds of all the different ranks of men, true zeal and affection to their country's welfare <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 line"></NOTE>.

<P>On the necessity of attention to the manners of the people, the following protest against the gin-act, 1742, is excellent.</P>
<P><Q>Because the act of the 9th of his present Majesty, to prevent the excessive drinking of spiritous liquors, which is by this bill to be repealed, declares, that the
<PB N="198" REF="013851_1222_0F9E2D3AA0AA2EC0">
drinking of spiritous liquors, or strong waters, is become very common, especially amongst the people of inferior ranks, the constant and excessive use whereof tends greatly to the destruction of their healths, rendering them unfit for useful labour and business, debauching their morals, and inciting them to perpetrate all manner of vice; and the ill conse|quences of the excessive use of such liquors, are not confined to the present generation, but extend to fu|ture ages, and tend to the devastation and ruin of this kingdom. We therefore apprehend, that if an act designed to remedy such indisputable mischiefs, was not found adequate to its salutary intention, the wisdom of the legislature ought to have examined its imperfections, and supplied its defects, and not have rescinded it by a law, authorising the manifold ca|lamities it was calculated to prevent. 2. Because the refusing to admit the most eminent physicians to give their opinions of the fatal consequences of these poisonous liquors, may be construed without doors, as a resolution of this house to suppress all authentic information of the pernicious effects of the health and morals of mankind, which will necessarily flow from the unrestrained licentiousness permitted by this bill. 3. Because, as it is the inherent duty of every legislative to be watchful in protecting the lives, and preserving the morals of the people, so the availing itself of their vices, debaucheries, and consequential miseries to the destruction of millions, is a manifest inversion of the fundamental principles of natural polity, and contrary to these social emoluments, by which government alone is instituted. 4. Because the opulence and power of a nation depend upon the numbers, vigour, and industry of its people; and its liberty and happiness on their temperance and mora|lity;

And as we conceive the contributions to be paid by these infamous recesses, and the money to be raised by this destructive project, are considera|tions highly unworthy the attention of parliament, when compared with the extensive evils from thence arising, so are we of opinion, that if the real exi|gencies of the public required raising the immense sums this year granted, they could by no means pal|liate the having recourse to a supply founded on the indulgence of debauchery, the encouragement of crimes, and the destruction of the human race <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P>Let us hear the lord <HI>Hervey</HI> on the same subject.</P>

They remarked likewise that the liquor, which they generally drank, was to the
<PB N="200" REF="013851_1224_0F9E2D3C99E24FF0">
last degree pernicious to health, and destructive of that corporeal vigour, by which the business of life is to be carried on; and a law was therefore made, by which it was intended that this species of debauchery, so peculiarly fatal, should be prevented. Against the end of this law, no man has hitherto made the least objection; no one hardened to signalize himself as an open advocate for vice, or attempted to prove, that drunkenness was not injurious to society, and contrary to the true ends of human being. The en|couragement of wickedness of this shameful kind, wickedness equally contemptible and hateful, was re|served for the present ministry, who are now about to supply those funds which they have exhausted by idle projects, and romantic expeditions, at the ex|pence of health and virtue, who have discovered a method of recruiting armies by the destruction of their fellow subjects, and while they boast themselves the assertors of liberty, are endeavouring to enslave us by the introduction of these vices, which in all countries and in every age, have made way for de|spotic power <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P>My worthy friend Mr. Professor <HI>Ferguson,</HI> of <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> thus describes the character and manner of life of men in higher stations, who are void of public spirit <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ferg.</HI> CIV. SOC. p. 399.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><Q>Men of business and of industry in the inferior stations of life retain their occupations, and are se|cured by a kind of necessity in the possession of those habits on which they rely for their quiet, and for the moderate enjoyments of life. But the higher orders of men, if they relinquish the state, if they cease to possess that courage and elevation of mind, and to exercise those talents which are employed in its de|fence and its government, are, in reality, by the seeming advantages of their station, become the re|fuse of that society of which they once were the or|nament; and from being the most respectable, and the most happy of its members, are become the most wretched and corrupt. In their approach to this con|dition, and in the absence of every manly occupation, they feel a dissatisfaction and languor which they can|not explain. They pine in the midst of apparent en|joyments; or by the variety and caprice of their dif|ferent pursuits and amusements, exhibit a state of agi|tation, which, like the disquiet of sickness, is not a proof of enjoyment or pleasure, but of suffering and pain. The care of his buildings, his equipage, or his table, is chosen by one; literary amusement, or some frivolous study, by another. The sports of the country, and the diversions of the town; the gaming
<PB N="202" REF="013851_1226_0F9E2D3EC09B3E30">
table, dogs, horses, and wine, are employed to fill up the blank of a listless and unprofitable life. These different occupations differ from each other in respect to their dignity, and their innocence: but none of them are the schools from which men are brought to sustain the tottering fortune of nations; they are equally avocations from what ought to be the princi|pal pursuit of man, the good of mankind. They speak of human pursuits as if the whole difficulty were to find something to do. They fix on some frivolous occupation, as if there was nothing that deserved to be done. They consider what tends to the good of their fellow-creatures as a disadvantage to themselves. They fly from every scene on which any efforts of vigour are required, or in which they might be allur|ed to perform any service to their country. We mis|apply our compassion in pitying the poor; it were much more justly applied to the rich, who become the first victims of that wretched insignificance, into which the members of every corrupted state, by the tendency of their weaknesses and their vices, are in haste to plunge themselves.</Q></P>
<P>The perverseness of statesmen, in almost all ages and countries, with respect to this part of their duty, is very unfortunate for mankind. Governments have it not in their power to do their subjects the least service as to their religious belief and mode of worship. On the contrary, whenever the civil magistrate interposes his authority in matter of religion, otherwise than in keeping the <HI>peace</HI> amongst <HI>all</HI> religious parties, you may trace every step he has taken by the mischievous effects his interposition has produced (of which more else|where), at the same time, that he has it in his power to do inexpressible service to the people under his care, by a strict attention to their manners and behaviour.
<PB N="203" REF="013851_1227_0F9E2D3F34BA5E08">
A king, a statesman, or a magistrate, who does not know this, is very improperly situated in the high station he fills; yet all history exhibits proofs of their misconduct in this respect. They have perpetually harassed themselves and their people about matters of belief, and forms of worship, and have neglected the most important duty of their function, the regulating of the moral and political principles and manners of the people.</P>
<P>The reason of this wrong-headed conduct is very shameful for our rulers, viz. because by joining forces with those of the priesthood, and labouring for the establishment of what they are pleased to call the true church, the true faith, &amp;c. (which are different in almost every different country) they open to them|selves a direct path to enslaving the people; whereas by guiding them into right, moral, and political prin|ciples and manners, they might enable them to judge soundly of the conduct of those in power, and inspire them with a noble spirit of resistance to tyranny, the most formidable of all dispositions to the greatest part of statesmen.</P>
<P>At the same time that our rulers shew great zeal for the true church, that is, a great desire to keep up the sacerdotal power, that the priesthood may in return keep up theirs, we see them make no hesitation to de|clare their disbelief of all religion. Christianity, ac|cording to them, is a fiction; but yet the church of <HI>England</HI> is the only true christian church. The infe|rior people seeing those of higher stations ranging themselves on the side of infidelity, are very much hurt in their manners. But christianity, for any thing the greatest part of our nobility and gentry know, may be either true or false. They do not know the strongest objections, having never given themselves time to ex|amine
<PB N="204" REF="013851_1228_0F9E2D4016F99780">
the subject, so that their belief or disbelief are of very little consequence to the people; but the de|claration of their disbelief shews very little regard to the good of their country.</P>
<P>Whether it be agreeable to sound policy for the rulers of countries to throw contempt upon the religion of their countries, let the excellent <HI>Montague</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntog.</HI> ANT. REPUBL. p. 294.</NOTE> decide.</P>
<P><Q>The Romans founded their system of policy at the very origin of their state upon that best and wisest principle, the fear of the Gods, [what we should call] a firm belief of a divine superintending provi|dence, and a future state of rewards and punishments. Their children were trained up in this belief from tender infancy, which took root and grew up with them by the influence of an excellent education, where they had the benefit of example as well as pre|cept. Hence we read of no heathen nation in the world where both the public and private duties of religion were so strictly adhered to, and so scrupulously observed, as amongst the <HI>Romans.</HI> They imputed their good or bad success to their observance of these duties, and they received public prosperities or pub|lic calamities, as blessings conferred, or punishments inflicted, by their Gods. Their historians hardly ever give us an account of any defeat received by that people, which they do not ascribe to the omission or contempt of some religious ceremony by their Gene|rals. For though the ceremonies there mentioned justly appear to us instances of the most absurd and most extravagant superstition, yet as they were es|teemed essential acts of religion by the <HI>Romans,</HI> they must consequently carry all the force of religious principle. We neither exceeded (says <HI>Cicero,</HI> speak|ing
<PB N="205" REF="013851_1229_0F9E2D404D88C478">
of his countrymen) the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in number, nor did we excel the <HI>Gauls</HI> in strength of body, nor the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> in craft, nor the <HI>Greeks</HI> in arts or sci|ences. But we have indisputably surpassed all the nations in the universe in piety and attachment to reli|gion, and in the only point which can be called true wisdom, a thorough conviction that all things here below are directed and governed by Divine Provi|dence. To this principle alone <HI>Cicero</HI> wisely attri|butes the grandeur and good fortune of his country. For what man is there, says he, who is convinced of the existence of the Gods, but must be convinced at the same time, that our mighty empire owes its ori|gin, increase, and its preservation, to the protecting care of their Divine Providence. A plain proof, that these continued to be the real sentiments of the wiser <HI>Romans,</HI> even in the corrupt times of <HI>Cicero.</HI> From this principle proceeded that respect for, and submission to their laws, and that temperance, mode|ration, and contempt for wealth, which are the best defence against the encroachments of injustice and oppression. Hence too arose that inextinguishable love for their country, which, next to the Gods, they looked upon as the chief object of veneration. This they carried to such a height of enthusiasm as to make every human tie of social love, natural affec|tion, and self-preservation, give way to this duty to their dearer country, Because they not only loved their country as their common mother, but revered it as a place which was dear to their Gods; which they had destined to give laws to the rest of the uni|verse, and consequently favoured with their peculiar care and protection. Hence proceeded that obstinate and undaunted courage, that insuperable contempt of danger, and death itself, in defence of their country,
<PB N="206" REF="013851_1230_0F9E2D43B8638430">
which complete the idea of the <HI>Roman</HI> character, as it is drawn by historians in the virtuous ages of the republic. As long as the manners of the <HI>Romans</HI> were regulated by this first great principle of religion, they were free and invincible. But the atheistical doctrine of <HI>Epicurus,</HI> which insinuated itself at <HI>Rome</HI> under the respectable name of philosophy, after their acquaintance with the <HI>Greeks,</HI> undermined and de|stroyed this ruling principle. I allow, that luxury, by corrupting manners, had weakened this principle, and prepared the <HI>Romans</HI> for the reception of atheism, which is the never failing attendant of luxury. But as long as this principle remained, it controuled manners, and checked the progress of humanity in proportion to its influence. But when the introduc|tion of atheism had destroyed this principle, the great bar to corruption was removed, and the passions at once let loose to run their full career, without check or controul.

very justly censures those as wrong-headed and wretchedly bungling politicians, who at that time endeavoured to eradicate the fear of an after reckon|ing, and the terrors of a hell, out of the minds of a people. Yet how few years ago did we see this mi|serably mistaken policy prevail in our own country, during the whole administration of some late power-engrossing ministers. Compelled at all events to se|cure a majority in parliament, to support themselves against the efforts of opposition, they found the greatest obstacle to their schemes arise from those principles of religion, which yet remained amongst the people. For though a great number of the elec|tors were not at all averse to the bribe, yet their con|sciences were too tender to digest perjury. To re|move this troublesome test at elections, which is one of the bulwarks of our constitution, would be imprac|ticable. To weaken or destroy those principles, upon which the oath was founded, and from which it derived its force and obligation, would equally an|swer the purpose, and destroy all publick virtue at the same time. The bloody and deep-felt effects of that hipocrisy which prevailed in the time of <HI>Crom|wel,</HI> had driven great numbers of the sufferers into the contrary extreme. When, therefore, so great a part of the nation was already prejudiced against whatever carried the appearance of a stricter piety, it is no wonder that shallow superficial reasoners, who have not logick enough to distinguish between the use and abuse of a thing, should readily embrace those atheistical tenets which were imported, and took root, in the voluptuous and thoughtless reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. But that solid learning which revived after the Resto|ration, easily baffled the efforts of open and avowed atheism, which from that time has taken shelter

under the less obnoxious name of deism. For the principles of modern deism, when stript of that dis|guise which has been artfully thrown over them to deceive them who hate the fatigue of thinking, and are very ready to admit any conclusion in argument which is agreeable to their passions, without exami|ning the premises, are in reality the same with those of <HI>Epicurus,</HI> as transmitted to us by <HI>Lucretius.</HI> The influence, therefore, which they had upon the man|ners of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> will readily account for those effects which we experience from them in our own country, where they so fatally prevail. To patronize and propagate these principles was the best expedient which the narrow, selfish policy, of those ministers could suggest; for their greatest extent of genius never reached higher than a fertility in tempo|rary shifts and expedients, to stave of the evil day of national account, which they so much dreaded. They were sensible that the wealth and luxury, which are the general effects of an extensive trade, in a state of profound peace, had already greatly hurt the morals of the people, and smoothed the way for their grand system of corruption. Far from checking this licentious spirit of luxury and dissipation, they left it to its full and natural effects upon the manners, whilst, in order to corrupt the principles of the peo|ple, they retained at the public expence a venal set of the most shameless miscreants that ever abused the liberty of the press, or insulted the religion of their country. To the administration of such ministers, which may justly be termed the grand aera of corrup|tion, we owe that fatal system of bribery, which has so greatly affected the morals of the electors in almost every borough in the kingdom. To that too we may justly attribute the present contempt and disregard of

<PB N="222" REF="013851_1246_0F9E2D53CEDF57B0">
was laid on the distillery, and afterwards it was resolved in parliament,
<Q>that the raising the price of spiritous liquors [by the stop of the distillery&punc;] was a principal cause of a diminution of the consumption of them, and had greatly contributed to the health, sobriety, and industry, of the common people. That in order to continue the high price, a large additional duty be laid on them, to be drawn back on exporta|tion <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">LOND. MAG. <HI>Sept.</HI> 1760.</NOTE>.</Q>
There were many petitions presented to the commons against taking off the prohibition, once par|ticularly, from the city of <HI>London,</HI> because it had proved so salutary. And many who considered cor|rupt parliaments as capable of any thing, scrupled not to say, the laying on of a high duty, on pretence of the people's good, was neither more nor less than a villanous imposition on the common sense of man|kind, and was in reality giving the wretched people a licence to poison their bodies and damn their souls, for the good of the revenue.</P>

<P>The debauchery of the people, as above observed, is supposed to support the revenue. Therefore the boundless multitude of ale-houses is not restrained.

<P>It is a monstrous absurdity in the <HI>English</HI> law, that the person injured by a thief or a cheat is obliged to bear the expence and trouble of prosecuting the thief or cheat, and recovers no damages, or however, is a loser upon the whole. We pay taxes on pretence of being protected by government. But government protects us so well, that we are obliged to pay for pro|tection besides our taxes. This inconvenience, and the extreme severity of our punishments in some cases, deter people of gentle natures from prosecuting offen|ders, which gives courage to the licentiousness of manners, and impunity to crimes.</P>
<P>The care of the manners of the people may be said to be the very business and calling of the clergy,
<PB N="224" REF="013851_1248_0F9E2D548BE0AE10">
in such manner, that if they neglect it, it is no matter what they attend to. The errors, deficiencies, and abuses in the clergy of established churches merit a very copious display in these collections. And very copious is the quantity of materials I have, in the course of my reading, collected on this subject. At present I shall only observe, that what the clergy bestow their <HI>princi|pal attention</HI> upon, is, comparatively of the <HI>least service</HI> for the important purpose of improving the manners of the people; I mean preaching. In the New Testament we read much of the importance of the apostles as he|ralds by divine commission, proclaiming the good mes|sage. That is the true meaning of the <HI>Greek</HI> phrase, which we translate preaching the gospel. But every body must see the difference between the importance of publishing to the world the amazing history of Christ, which history was either unknown to, or misunder|stood by those to whom the heavenly heralds proclaimed it, and our explaining and inculcating a doctrine or a precept of a religion, of which we have the beautiful and simple code in our hands, and have been brought up in the belief of it. The business of the apostles was the same with that of missionaries sent from <HI>Europe</HI> to convert the heathens to christianity. The function of the modern clergy of <HI>Europe</HI> must be supposed to be different from this, as the state of the people of <HI>Europe</HI> is different from that of the heathens in <HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>America.</HI> They clergy of <HI>England</HI> ought, therefore to apply themselves to teaching in more ways than one. They ought not to think they have dis|charged the duty of their function, when they have <HI>read</HI> over a velvet cushion a learned and elegant dis|course on some point in theology or in morals: a true and faithful pastor will consider it as the principal part of his duty to be intimately acquainted with every

individual of his flock, to obtain and keep the first and highest place in the esteem of every inhabitant of his parish, in such manner, that the advice of their faithful, laborious, and disinterested spiritual guide shall, upon all occasions, be acceptable to them. In all which there is no other difficulty, than the difficulty of shewing his people that he is more desirous of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing serviceable to them, than of improving his income, of obtaining a fatter living, or a plurality, and for that purpose currying favour with those who have livings in their gift, by plunging into party-quarrels, and doing dirty work at elections, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A benevolent disposition revolts against every discou|ragement to the exercise of the godlike virtue of cha|rity. But truth is truth, and it must be acknow|ledged, that the profusion of our charities is hurtful to the manners of our people. Even in this rich country, the number of those who have it not in their power, without strict care, constant labour, and severe parsi|mony, to save any thing for old age, is very great. All that policy is sound, which tends to improve and increase industry and frugality among the working people; and all that oeconomy is hurtful, which tends to produce in the poor people a contrary spirit, and which occasions their becoming more burdens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me to their richer fellow-subjects, than is absolutely necessary; because this lays an additional burden upon all our exports, and hurts our trade at foreign markets, upon which all depends. Let our innumerable and exorbitant public charities be considered in this light. If the poor are led by them to look upon industry and frugality as unnecessary, they will neither be industrious nor frugal; and the consequence will be, that they and their children will come upon the parish, instead of being maintained by labour and industry.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="013851_1250_0F9E2D58DC239918">Besides the general hurtful consequences arising from the excessive number of our public charities, our manner of conducting them, and of admitting in|dividuals to the benefit of them, are obnoxious to va|rious censures, too numerous to be particularly speci|fied here. Were the admission of individuals to the benefit of our charities put upon a proper soot, our charities might be of great benefit in improving (in|stead of hurting, as they do at present) the manners of the people. Did magistrates keep an attentive eye upon the behaviour of individuals, and were they to keep a register of the complaints made against the idle and debauched, the register to be inspected upon every individual's applying for the benefit of a public chari|ty, that it might appear, whether he had lived a life of labour and frugality, or brought himself to want by his own fault. Did an individual among the lower people know, that he should be provided for in his old age, not in the present promiscuous way, but ac|cording to his behaviour through life; we should see him more attentive to his conduct, lest the justice's book, upon his applying for relief in his old age, or in case of an accident, should rise in judgment against him, and exclude him from the best provision.</P>

<P>Besides what might be done by a government setting itself in earnest to correct and form the manners, it is certain that the morals and principles of all ranks, high and low, might be improved in the same way, that na|tural knowledge has been improved.

<P>When <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of <HI>France</HI> took <HI>Paris,</HI> which was in rebellion against him, there were two or three citi|zens killed.

We have long complained, but in vain, that the military are called in to quell every trifling riot, where the peace officers would have done the business as effectually, and with more safety.

<P>The riot-act was made with a view merely tempo|rary, and therefore ought to have been repealed, when the occasion of making it was at an end. It is too cruel and bloody. A peaceable subject may chance to be wedged in the middle of a mob, so that he can|not extricate himself at the reading of the riot-act, The man may be lame; he may be overtaken with liquor; he may not even know, that the riot-act has been read, if the mob around him was noisy, if he was at a distance from the place, or if he was hard of hear|ing. Is the unhappy man to be seized, imprisoned like a fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, tried, and put to an infamous death, only be|cause he was so unfortunate, as to get himself en|tangled in a mob? So says the riot-act. Yet we know, all good government is founded in paternal principles. But what should we think of that father,
<PB N="232" REF="013851_1256_0F9E2D5F0C9B4B80">
who should murder his son, because he would not go out of the room when ordered? Disobedience in chil|dren or subjects is highly culpable: but cruelty and in|justice in parents, or governors, in punishing disobe|dience, is infamous. The intention in making penal laws, ought to be, to prevent a greater evil by a less. Is the riot-act constructed upon this principle? I happen to offend the mob. Two or three hundred idle fellows assemble, and break my windows. Twenty shillings will repair the damage. No, says the riot-act. A ma|gistrate shall send for the standing army. They shall seize all they can lay hold on, after reading the riot-act. Those they seize shall be hanged. And if, in apprehending the offenders, any one, or more, are killed, it shall not be murder. See the Act. This last clause may be said to be, like <HI>Draco</HI>'s laws, written in blood. For it naturally suggests to a cowardly magi|strate (cowards are generally cruel), that the readiest way to disperse the mob is, to order the soldiers to fire upon them. This is indeed a gross abuse of the in|tention of the law. For, absurd and ill framed as it is, the intention of it was quite different from this. The meaning of the law is, that all persons, soldiers as well as others, should assist the civil magistrate in quelling riots. And, lest the magistrate should be in|timidated in the discharge of this part of his duty, he, and all who are aiding to him, should be indemnified fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m prosecution, on account of any person's being unavoidably killed in the scuffle. The riot-act, bloody as it is, was not so bloodily intentioned, as to mean, that whenever a disturbance happens in the middle of a great town, which such is the well-known good-nature and good-understanding of the people of <HI>Eng|land</HI>) may almost always be quieted by a few civil words from any man, who is in favour with them; im|mediately
<PB N="233" REF="013851_1257_0F9E2D5FCB574260">
a band of ruffian soldiers shall be brought to fire in at windows, and murder women and children. This was not, I say, in any degree, the intention of the riot-act. But it is so ill contrived, that it is very easily abused to this cruel purpose. There ought to have been an express prohibition of fire arms in the hands of those who were to assist the civil magistrate, with capital punishment of any person on the side of the insurgents, who should use those dreadful instru|ments of destruction. At <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the <HI>Ianiza|ries</HI> are armed only with clubs. Fire-arms are not the proper implements for quelling the unruly dispositions of our own children. They are very proper indeed, if our scheme be to murder them, and thin the land. Nor ought the soldiery to be, on any account, called in on such occasion. The veriest court sycophant in the nation does not pretend, that a standing army, nu|merous enough to conquer the world, is kept up in profound peace, merely for the purpose of keeping the people quiet. This he knows to be too gross to pass; because he knows, that it is but very lately that we had a standing army; that in <HI>Henry</HI> VIIth's time the yeomen of the guards were the whole regular force under the king's command, except in war time. No; he pretends, that the necessity of a standing army arises wholly from the practice of the other crowned heads of <HI>Europe</HI>; and that, because they who live on a vast continent together, and are liable to be attacked at any time by their neighbours, must keep up a mili|tary force for their defence, therefore we, who are surrounded by a sea, and a fleet equal to all the naval force of <HI>Europe,</HI> must keep up a standing army, as numerous as that of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great. Let this be for a moment admitted (though nothing can well be imagined more palpably absurd) does it not follow,
<PB N="234" REF="013851_1258_0F9E2D631BE44628">
that to call in the standing army, with their murderous fire-arms, to keep the peace within the realm, is a gross misapplication of them? If the army can at any time quell an insurrection of the people, why may they not quell the spirit of liberty in the people? And then a complete tyranny is established. For every government will be tyrannical, if they dare. Had the riot-act been m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de before the Revolution, we had probably never seen that glorious event.</P>
<P>The intention of the riot-act being, to seize, and bring to regular trial by jury (see the Act), nothing can be more absurd (besides the cruelty of it) than the application of fire-arms for quelling mobs; because fire-arms do not seize people, but murder them: a nett, a rope, a shepherd's crook would be natural in|struments for seizing or apprehending.</P>

my lords, some of our civil magistrates, at least those of an inferior degree, begin to put too great confi|dence in their having a military force at their com|mand, and therefore make a little too free with the lower sort of people, or at least do not take proper measures for reconciling the people, in a good natured and peaceable manner, to the laws of their country: a man who has power, is but too seldom at the pains to use argument.</Q></P>
<P>In the riot act <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">STAT. AT LARGE, IV.600.</NOTE>, there is no mention of military, nor of firing; but if any person happens to be killed in the apprehending, or endeavouring to apprehend him, it shall not be murder, &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>The liberty of firing at random, says a speaker in the house of peers, upon any multitude of his ma|jesty's subjects, is a liberty which ought to be most cautiously granted, and never made use of, but in cases of the most absolute necessity; and in this way of thinking, I am supported by the whole tenor of the laws of <HI>England.</HI> It is now three or four hun|dred years since fire-arms first became in use among us; yet the law has never suffered them to be made use of by the common officers of justice. Pikes, halberts, battle-axes, and such like, are the only weapons that can be made use of according to law. by such officers; and the reason is extremely plain, because, with such weapons they can seldom or ever hurt, much less kill any but such as are really op|posing or assaulting them; whereas if you put fire arms into their hands, and allow them to make the proper use of such arms, they may as probably hurt or kill the innocent as the guilty; nay in cities and towns, where such tumults generally happen, they
<PB N="238" REF="013851_1262_0F9E2D6690D1D110">
may kill people sitting in their own houses, or look|ing innocently over their windows, which all persons are apt to do, but especially women and children, when they hear any hubbub or n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ise in the streets; and which was really in the affair now before us; for one woman was killed in her master's house, by her being unfortunately, but innocently, at the win|dow when the soldiers fired <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.

<P><Q>There are two sorts of mobs, or assemblies of the people; one is when a multitude of people assembles together upon any lawful or innocent occasion, and afterwards happen to become riotous; and the other is when a multitude of people assembles together with a design to commit some unlawful or wicked action. With respect to the former, the most gentle measures ought to be made use of for dispersing them, because many innocent persons being inveigled into the crowd, it may be some time before they can possibly get away; but with respect to the latter, as all that are assembled together upon such an occasion must be some way guilty, therefore more rough and violent measures may be made use of for dispersing them, and for preventing the mischief they intended. But in both these cases the law is now certain and indispu|table. Your lordships all know that by a late sta|tute, which is in force in <HI>Scotland</HI> as well as in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> the power of the civil magistrate, in the case of any mob, or riotous assembly, is fully and distinctly regulated; yet even by that law, which I have often heard complained of, as a law not tolerable in a free country, there is no express power given to the ma|gistrate or his assistants, to make use of fire-arms; so cautious was the legislature, even at that time,

when tumults were more frequent and more danger|ous than they are at present, of giving a legal autho|rity for the making use of such weapons. After reading the proclamation, and after giving the mob an hour's time to disperse themselves, and to depart to their habitations, or lawful business, the peace-officers may then, by that law, seize or disperse them who shall afterwards continue unlawfully assembled; and if any person, by resisting them, shall happen to be killed, maimed, or hurt, the peace-officers and their assistants are indemnified; but I doubt much if a magistrate would be indemnified, even by this law, should he take the short way of dispersing a mob, by ordering his assistants to fire among them, and should thereby kill any person who had committed no overt act of resistance <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P><Q>A law was made for preventing or quelling riots and tumults within the city of <HI>Edinburgh</HI>; for which purpose the magistrates of that city are enabled. with the King's allowance, to raise soldiers on pay, to use haquebuts, and all other arms, when they shall think expedient; and if any person resisting the said magistrates in the quelling of any riot, shall be hurt or slain, the magistrates and their assistants are indem|nified; provided such hurt or killing was with long weapons, and not by shooting haquebuts or the like. I need not acquaint your lordships, that haquebut was the name then used in that country, and formerly in this, for fire arms; that by long weapons was meant halberts, battle-axes, and such weapons as are comonly used by all assistants to officers of justice in that part of the island, as well as this.

It was my too great zeal for his illustrious family, that transported me to give that vote for which I am now heartily grieved. But even then I never imagined it was to remain a law for ever. No, Sir! This government is founded upon resistance; it was the principle of resistance that brought about the revolution, which cannot be justi|fied upon any other principle. Is then passive obedi|ence and non-resistance to be established by a perpe|tual law, by a law the most scarce and the most arbi|trary of any in <HI>England,</HI> and that under a government which owes its very being to resistance? The Hon. Gentleman who first mentioned it, said very right; it is a scandal it should remain in our statute-books; and I will say, they are no friends to his Majesty, or to his government, who desire it should: for it de|stroys that principle upon which is founded one of his best titles to the crown.

<P>What Lord <HI>Carteret</HI> said in the House of Peers, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1737, on occasion of the affair of <HI>Porteous,</HI> is very just.</P>
<P><Q>The people seldom or ever assemble in any riotous or tumultuous manner unless when they are oppress|ed, or at least imagine they are oppressed. If the

people should me mistaken, and imagine they are op|pressed when they are not, it is the duty of the next magistrate to endeavour first to correct their mistake by fair means and just reasoning. In common huma|nity he is obliged to take this method, before he has recourse to such methods as may bring death and de|struction upon a great number of his fellow-country|men, and this method will generally prevail where they have not met with any real oppression: But when this happens to be the case, it cannot be ex|pected they will give ear to their oppressor, nor can the severest laws, nor the most rigorous execution of those laws, always prevent the people's becoming tu|multuous; you may shoot them, you may hang them, but, till the oppression is removed or alleviated, they will never be quiet, till the greatest part of them are destroyed <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. PEERS, V.138,</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The court cant, in support of the practice of call|ing the soldiery to quell riots, is, That the soldiery are the king's subjects, as well as other men; and all subjects are obliged to assist the magistrate in case of need. But why must the <HI>soldiery,</HI> rather than any other subjects, be sent for from an hundred miles dis|tance, to quell a disturbance, if it be not that the sol|diery are more formidable to the people than any other subjects? Is it not therefore manifest, that every argu|ment for calling in the military is a two-edged one? The more fit the military are for quelling riots, the more fit they likewise must be for quelling the spirit of liberty, and enslaving the people. If disciplined troops be necessary, it is not necessary that those troops be the hirelings of the court, enslaved for life.</P>
<P>The law means, even when it punishes, not re|venge,
<PB N="245" REF="013851_1269_0F9E2C888D198BD0">
but example. The magistrate is not to mix his passions with the execution of justice; nor is he to enforce the execution of the best laws at all hazards. He is not to fire a city in order to force a nest of thieves out of their lurking holes. Violence on the part of government tends to irritate, not to quiet, the minds of the people. Better fifty were punished legally, than five massacred. Musquet-balls against brick-bats are an unequal match, and cowardly on the part of go|vernment. If the train-bands, town-guards, peace-officers, and <HI>posse comitatus</HI> be not sufficient, let the laws concerning them be mended. But let not an army, the bond-slaves of a corrupt court, find, that they have the people under their command, lest they first subdue the people, and then, like <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s men, turn upon their own masters.</P>
<P>The way to prevent mobs (every government shews its sagacity more by prevention than by punishment) is, to keep up a good police, to take care that the peo|ple be employed and maintained, and that they be well principled, which requires punishing an idle, or in|cendiary priesthood (as those in <HI>Sacheverel's</HI> time) and making them, and the community where disorders are committed, answerable, according to King <HI>Alfred</HI>'s institution; and by a mild and fatherly government's taking care that the people have no just ground of complaint.</P>
<P>By 13 <HI>Henry</HI> IV. it is enacted, that in case of a riot, the Sheriff may come with the <HI>posse comitatus,</HI> if need be, (not with a regiment of soldiers) and arrest the disturbers of the peace, as was ordained by two statutes of <HI>Richard</HI> II.

<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of the Liberty of Speech and Writing on Political Subjects.</HEAD>
<P>IN an inquiry into public abuses no one will wonder to find punishment inflicted by government upon complainers, reckoned as an abuse; for it cer|tainly is one of the most atrocious abuses, that a free subject should be restrained in his inquiries into the conduct of those who undertake to manage his affairs; I mean the administrators of government: for all such are undertakers, and are answerable for what they un|dertake: but if it be dangerous and penal to enquire into their conduct, the state may be ruined by their blunders, or by their villanies, beyond the possibility of redress.</P>
<P>There seems to be somewhat unnatural in attempt|ing to lay a restraint on those who would criticise the conduct of men who undertake to do other people's business. It is an offence, if we remark on the decision of a court of law, on the proceedings of either house of parliament, or of the administration; all whose pro|ceedings we are immediately concerned in. At the
<PB N="247" REF="013851_1271_0F9E2C8B9CD76C40">
same time, if a man builds a house for himself, marries a wife for himself, or writes a book, by which the public gets more than the author, it is no offence to make very severe and unjust remarks.</P>
<P>Are Judges, Juries, Counsellors, Members of the House of Commons, Peers, Secretaries of State, or Kings, infallible? Or are they short-sighted, and per|haps interested, mortals?</P>
<P>In a petition to parliament, a bill in chancery, and proceedings at law, libellous words are not punishable; because freedom of speech and writing are indispen|sably necessary to the carrying on of business. But it may be said, there is no necessity for a private writer to be indulged the liberty of attacking the conduct of those who take upon themselves to govern the state. The answer is easy, viz. That all history shews the necessity, in order to the preservation of liberty, of every subjects having a watchful eye on the conduct of Kings, Ministers, and Parliament, and of every sub|jects being not only secured, but encouraged in alarm|ing his fellow subjects on occasion of every attempt upon public liberty, and that private, independent subjects <HI>only</HI> are like to give faithful warning of such attempts; their betters (as to rank and fortune) being more likely to conceal, than detect the abuses com|mitted by those in power. If, therefore, private wri|ters are to be intimidated in shewing their fidelity to their country, the principal security of liberty is taken away.</P>
<P>Punishing libels public or private is foolish, because it does not answer the end, and because the end is a bad one, if it could be answered.</P>
<P>The Attorney General <HI>De Grey</HI> confessed in the House of Commons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1770 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">ALM. DEB. COM. IX.22.</NOTE>, that his power
<PB N="248" REF="013851_1272_0F9E2C8D94B3ED40">
of filing informations <HI>ex officio</HI> is an odious power, and that it does not answe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the purpose intended; for that he had not been able to bring any libeller to justice.' Mr. <HI>Pownal</HI> shewed that power to be illegal and unconstitutional; for that, according to law, no <HI>Englishman</HI> is to be brought upon his trial, but by pre|sentment of his country; a few particular cases ex|cepted.</P>
<P>When the lawyers say a libel is criminal, though <HI>true,</HI> they mean, because it is, according to them, a breach of the peace, and tends to excite revenge. They allow, that the <HI>falsehood</HI> of the charge is an ag|gravation <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blackstone,</HI> IV.150.</NOTE>, and that, therefore the person libelled has no right to damages, if the charges laid against him be <HI>true.</HI> But by this rule it should seem, that the <HI>truth</HI> of the libel should take away all its criminality. For if I have no right to damages, I have no pretence to seek revenge. Therefore to libel me for what I cannot affirm myself to be innocent of, is no breach of the peace, as it does not naturally tend to excite revenge, but rather ingenuous shame and reformation.</P>
<P>Let us hear on this subject the excellent Lord <HI>Chesterfield,</HI> on the bill for licensing the stage, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1737.</P>
<P><Q>In public, as well as private life, the only way to prevent being ridiculed or censured, is to avoid all ridiculous or wicked measures, and to pursue such only as are virtuous and worthy. The people never endeavour to ridicule those they love and esteem, nor will they suffer them to be ridiculed. If any one at|tempts it, their ridicule returns upon the author; he makes himself only the object of public hatred and contempt. The actions or behaviour of a private
<PB N="249" REF="013851_1273_0F9E2C8E88DD4980">
man may pass unobserved, and consequently unap|plauded and uncensured; but the actions of these in high stations, can neither pass without notice nor without censure or applause; and therefore an admi|nistration without esteem, without authority, among the people, let their power be ever so great or ever so arbitrary, will be ridiculed: the severest edicts, the most terrible punishments cannot prevent it. If any man, therefore, thinks he has been censured, if any man thinks he has been ridiculed, upon any of our public theatres, let him examine his actions he will find the cause, let him alter his conduct he will find a remedy. As no man is perfect, as no man is infal|lible, the greatest may err, the most circumspect may be guilty of some piece of ridiculous behaviour. It is not licentiousness, it is an useful liberty always indulged the stage in a free country, that some great men may there meet with a just reproof, which none of their friends will be free enough, or rather faithful enough to give them. Of this we have a famous in|stance in the <HI>Roman</HI> history. The great <HI>Pompey,</HI> after the many victories he had obtained, and the great conquests he had made, had certainly a good title to the esteem of the people of <HI>Rome.</HI> Yet that great man, by some error in his conduct, became an object of general dislike; and therefore in the representation of an old play, when <HI>Diphilus</HI> the actor came to re|peat these words, <HI>Nostr&acirc; miseri&acirc; tu es magnus,</HI> the audience immediately applyed them to <HI>Pompey,</HI> who at that time was as well known by the name of <HI>Mag|nus</HI> as by the name <HI>Pompey,</HI> and were so highly pleased with the satire, that, as <HI>Cicero</HI> tells us, they made the actor repeat the words one hundred times over. An account of this was immediately sent to <HI>Pompey,</HI> who, instead of resenting it as an injury,
<PB N="250" REF="013851_1274_0F9E2C8E932C9D78">
was so wise as to take it for a just reproof. He exa|mined his conduct, he altered his measures, he re|gained by degrees the esteem of the people, and then he neither feared the wit, nor felt the satire of the stage. This is an example which ought to be fol|lowed by great men in all countries <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. PEERS. V.214.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Even the cruel <HI>Tiberius,</HI> when in good humour, could say,

<HI>Titus</HI> defied any one to scandalize him. <HI>Trajan</HI> published absolute liberty of speech and writing. <HI>Constantine,</HI> when he was told that some ill-disposed persons had battered his head and face, mean|ing those of his statue, felt himself all about those parts, and told his courtiers, he found nothing amiss; desiring that they would take no trouble about find|ing out the violators of the statue.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gordon</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cato</HI>'s LET. I.246.</NOTE> allows the maxim, that a libel is not the less a libel for being true.

they are to run the hazard of being thus publicly ac|cused of corruption, embezzlement, and other politi|cal crimes, without having it in their power to punish their slanderers. To this I answer, It is no hardship at all, but the unavoidable inconvenience attendant upon a high station, which he who dislikes must a|void, and keep himself private. <HI>Cato</HI> was forty times tried. But we do not think the worse of <HI>Cato</HI> for this. If a statesman is liable to be falsly accused, let him comfort himself by recollecting, that he is well paid. An ensign is liable to be killed in war; and he has but 3 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> a day. If a statesman has designedly behaved amiss, he ought to be punished with the utmost seve|rity; because the injury he has done, is unboundedly extensive. If he has injured the public through weak|ness, and without wicked intention, he is still punish|able; because he ought not to have thrust himself into a station for which he was unfit. But, indeed, these cases are so rare (want of <HI>honesty</HI> being the general cause of mal-administration), that it is scarce worth while to touch upon them. If a statesman is falsly accused, he has only to clear his character, and he appears in a fairer light than before. He must not insist on punishing his accuser: for the public security requires, that there be no danger in accusing those who under|take the administration of national affairs. The punish|ment of political satyrists gains credit to their writings, nor do unjust governments reap any fruit from such severities, but insults to themselves, and honour to those whom they prosecute.</P>
<P>A libel is in fact (criminally speaking) a <HI>non entity, i. e.</HI> there is no such offence as scandal. For if the punishment was taken away, the whole of the evil would be taken away, because nobody would regard scandal; but people would believe every person's cha|racter

<P>It has been pretended, that it is impossible to admi|nister government without general warrants. But this is a mistake. For all that is necessary, even when treasonable designs are suspected to be carrying on, is watchfulness in magistrates and officers to find out the guilty persons, who, when found or reasonably sus|pected, are to be apprehended by a special warrant from a magistrate, who is supposed to be a person of such fortune, as to be responsible for whatever damage an innocent person may suffer, if unjustly apprehended

and imprisoned. Whereas to trust this power in the hands of a set of brutal and beggarly officers, is need|lessly putting the safety of the best subjects in the power of the lowest of the people, unless the person who grants the general warrant be answerable for the behaviour of his officers, which is laying <HI>him</HI> at their mercy. If this be disputed, let it be considered, that supposing a set of persons taken up by general warrant, if they cannot be convicted, they must be set at liber|ty, whether guilty or innocent. And if they, or any of them, proves to be guilty, there must have been ways and means of fastening upon him sufficient sus|picions to justify the issuing out a <HI>special</HI> warrant against him; else we must suppose the whole set taken at random, and the guilty afterwards found among them by chance. To issue a warrant for apprehending all persons who shall be found in the actual commission of punishable actions, may be at sometimes necessary; and this necessity does, in no respect, defend general warrants; because the confining of a warrant to those who are taken in circumstances of guilt, makes it a special warrant, and secures the innocent, (which is all that is wanted) from trouble.</P>
<P>To seize all the papers indiscriminately of the sup|posed writer of an accusation against a statesman, pro|bably a just accusation (for there is little danger of accusing a statesman undeservedly), is treating the friend of his country, and detector of villany, worse than we treat a thief or a highwayman. For we seize nothing of what we find in the possession of such peo|ple, but what is likely to have been unfairly come by.

<P>On occasion of <HI>Plunket</HI>'s conspiracy, <HI>A D.</HI> 1723, several lords protested on passing th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bill of attainder against him, for the following reason&punc; which express a noble spirit of liberty, and an amiable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nderness for the safety of accused subjects.</P>
<P N="1"><Q>1. Because bills of this nature, as we conceive, ought not to pass but in case of evident necessity, when the preservation of the state plainly requires it, which we take to be very far from the present case; the con|spiracy having been detected so long since, and the
<PB N="260" REF="013851_1284_0F9E2C97E4C1F538">
person accused seeming to us very inconsiderable in all respects, and who, from the many gross untruths it now appears he has written to his correspondents abr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad, must appear to have been an impostor and de|ceiver even to his own party. 2. Proceedings of this kind, tending to convict and punish, are in the nature, though not form, judicial, and do let the commons, in effect, into an equa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> share with the lords in judi|cature, which the lords ought to be very jealous of doing, since the power of judicature is the greatest distinguishing power the lords have; and there will be little reason to hope, that if bills of this nature are given way to by the lords, the commons will ever bring up impeachments, or make themselves accusers only when they can act as judges. 3. This bill, in our opinion, differs materially from the precedents cited for it; as in the case of Sir <HI>Iohn Fenwick,</HI> 'tis plain, by the preamble of that bill, that the ground most relied on to justify proceeding against him in that manner was, that there had been two legal wit|nesses proving the high treason against him, that a bill was found against him on their evidence, and se|veral times appointed him for a legal trial thereon, in the ordinary course, which he procured to be put off, by undertaking to discover, till one of the evidences withdrew; so that it was solely his fault that he had not a legal trial by jury; all which circumstances, not being in the present case, we take it they are not at all to be compared to one another. 4. As to the acts which passed to detain <HI>Counter</HI> and others con|cerned in the conspiracy to assassinate the late King <HI>William</HI>&punc; of glorious memory, we conceive these acts were not in their nature bills of attainder, as this is; but purely to enable the crown to keep them in prison notwithstanding the laws of liberty, whereas this is a
<PB N="261" REF="013851_1285_0F9E2C9855D23650">
bill to inflict pains and penalties, and does import a conviction and sentence on the prisoner, not only to lose his liberty, but also his lands and tenements, goods and chattels, of which he having none, as we believe, we cannot apprehend why it was inserted, and this bill not drawn on the plan of <HI>Counter</HI>'s, &amp;c. unless it was to make a precedent for such forfeitures in cases of bills which may hereafter be brought, to convict persons who have great estates, upon evidence which does not come up to what the law in being re|quires. 5. If there be a defect of legal evidence to prove this man guilty of high-treason, such defect always was, and, we think, if bills of this nature brought to supply original defects in evidence do receive countenance, they may become familiar, and then many an innocent person may be reached by them, since 'tis hard to be distinguished, whether that defect proceeds from the cunning and artifice, or from the innocence of the party. 6. This proceeding by bill, does not only, in our opinion, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd to lay aside the judicial power of the lords, but even the use of juries; which distinguishes this nation from all its neigh|bours, and is of the highest value to all who rightly understand the security and other benefits arising from it; and whatever tends to alter or weaken that great privilege, we think, is an alteration in our constitution for the worse, though it be done by act of parliament; and if it may be supposed, that any of our fundamental laws were set aside by act of parlia|ment, the nation, we apprehend, would not be at all the more comforted from that consideration, that the parliament did it. 7. It is the essence of natural justice, as we think, but is most surely the law of the realm, that no person should be tried more than once for the same crime, or twice put in peril of losing his
<PB N="262" REF="013851_1286_0F9E2C99112BE790">
life, liberty, or estate; and though we acquiesce in the opinion of all the judges, that if this bill should pass into a law, <HI>Plunket</HI> cannot be again prosecuted for the crimes contained in the preamble of the bill, yet it is certain, that if a bill of this kind should hap|pen to be rejected by either house of parliament, or by the king, the person accused might be attacked again and again in like manner, in any subsequent session of parliament, or indeed for the same offence, notwith|standing that either house of parliament should have found him innocent, and not passed the bill for that reason; and we conceive it a very great exception to this course of proceeding, that a subject may be condemned and punished, but not acquitted by it. 8. We think it appears in all our history, that the passing bills of attainder as this, we think, in its na|ture, is, (except, as before is said, in cases of absolute and clear necessity) have proved so many blemishes to the reigns in which they passed; and therefore we thought it our duty in time, and before the passing this bill as a precedent, to give our advice and votes against the passing it&punc; being very unwilling that any thing should pass which, in our opinions, would in the least derogate from the glory of this reign. 9. We apprehended it to be more for the interest and security of his Majesty's government, that bills of this nature should not pass than that they should since persons who think at all, cannot but observe, that in this case, some things have been received as evidence, which would not have been received in any court of judicature; that precedents of this kind are naturally growing, as we think, this goes beyond any other which has happened since the Revolution, and if from such like observations they shall infer, as we cannot but do, that the liberty and prosperity of the

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Addressed to the independent Part of the People of GREAT-BRITAIN, IRELAND, and the CO|LONIES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Countrymen and Fellow-subjects,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE in these volumes laid before you a faith|ful and a dreadful account of what is, or is likely soon to be, the condition of public affairs in this great empire. I have exposed to your view some of the capital abuses and grievances, which are sinking you into slavery and destruction. I have shewn you, that as things go on, there will soon be very little left of the <HI>British</HI> constitution, besides the name and the outward form. I have shewn you, that the house of representatives, upon which all depends, has lost its efficiency, and, instead of being (as it ought) a check upon regal and ministerial tyranny, is in the way to be soon a mere outwork of the court, a <HI>French</HI> par|liament to register the royal edicts, a <HI>Roman</HI> senate in the imperial times, to give the appearance of regular and free government; but in truth, to accomplish the villanous schemes of a profligate junto, the na|tural consequences and unavoidable effects of inade|quate representation, septennial parliaments, and placemen in the house. All which shews the abso|lute necessity of regulating representation, of restoring our parliaments to their primitive annual period, and of disqualifying dependents on the court from voting in the house of commons.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="013851_1292_0F9E2CA15E331FF8">I am mistaken, if there be not many persons of con|sequence in the state, who, by reading these collections, will see the condition of public affairs to be much more disorderly than they could have imagined. For my own part, though I have long been accustomed to look upon my country with fear and anxiety, I own frankly, that till I saw the abuses and the dangers displayed in <HI>one view,</HI> I did not see things in the horrid light I now do. Nor can I expect the readers of these volumes to see them in the same light, be|cause these volumes do not contain all the abuses I have collected, though they contain enough to put out of all doubt the necessity of redress; as a prudent person, if he observed one of his out-houses on fire, would extinguish it in all haste, though he did not think his dwelling house in immediate hazard. I wish we could say, it is only an out-work that is in danger. The main body of the building, the parlia|ment itself, on which all depends, is in a ruinous condition. Accordingly, I have not in the foregoing part of this work amused you, my good countrymen, with a set of frivolous or trifling remarks upon grievances which, though removed, would still leave others remaining, to the great distress and disadvan|tage of the subjects. The grievances I have pointed out, are such as all disinterested men must allow to be real; and such as, if redressed, would insure the re|dress of all other grievances of inferior consequence; which is more than can be said of many of those that have been pointed out in our late petitions and re|monstrances. Concerning them wise and good men, and true friends to liberty, have differed; but no wise and good man or true friend to liberty, can doubt, whether <HI>England</HI> can be safe with a corrupt par|liament, and the various other disorders and abuses
<PB N="269" REF="013851_1293_0F9E2CA169E12548">
above pointed out, remaining unredressed and uncor|rected.</P>
<P>Nor have I, my good countrymen, advised you to repose your confidence in one set of men rather than another. I have not told you, that the <HI>Rockingham</HI> party can save you any more than the <HI>Bedford</HI> party. I have not advised you to put your trust in Lord <HI>Bute</HI> rather than Lord <HI>Chatham.</HI> The truth is, that any set of ministers must misconduct the affairs of the nation, so long as the nation itself is upon a bad footing. And it is equally true, that an incorrupt parliament will make any ministry upright.</P>
<P><Q>The wisdom of these latter times in prince's affairs, is rather fine deliveries, and shiftings of dangers and mischiefs when they are near, than solid or grounded courses to keep them aloof <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bac.</HI> ESSAYS.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Have I, my good countrymen, imposed upon you in the least article? Can you seriously bring you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">selves even to doubt, whether the grievances I have pointed out, be really such? Do you sincerely b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lieve it possible to go on in the track we are now in? Is there a shadow of consistency between the present state of our public affairs, and liberty, safety, peace, or the <HI>Bri|tish</HI> constitution? While the enemies of your liber|ties are active and vigilant to seize every opportunity for increasing their own emoluments, and their own power, and you are timid and thoughtless of your own safety, will your public grievances redress themselves? Will corruption and venality die away of course, or will they spread wider and wider, and take still deeper root, till at last it will become impossible to eradicate them? Look into the <HI>Roman</HI> history, and see how corruption in the people, and tyranny in the emperors,
<PB N="270" REF="013851_1294_0F9E2CA20DC68CE0">
went on increasing from <HI>Augustus</HI> to <HI>Didius,</HI> who fairly bought the empire, when it was put up to sale. Look back but a little way into your own history. It is but 86 years since the Revolution, a very short period, a lifetime! Yet we have not been able, or have not been willing, to keep up, for this short time, the con|stitution then settled, because indeed it was so imper|fectly established at that time, and because we have been almost ever since in the hands of a set of foreign kings, and of flagitious ministers, which last have traiterously abused your easy generosity, and have, by introducing corruption, in great measure undone what was done by expelling the <HI>Stuarts.</HI> The standing ar|my, the number of placemen in the house, the exten|sion of excise-laws, and various other abuses, have crept on still increasing, till at last they are settled into a part of the constitution, and what formerly produced severe remonstrances, and violent debates in parliament, pass now unquestioned, and without debate or division.</P>
<P>Some unthinking, or interested or timid people among us, insist, that there is no need of any reformation; that all is safe and secure; whilst others of a more de|jected disposition alledge, that all is gone past reco|very; that reformation is chimerical and impossible; and that we have nothing left, but to sink as quietly as we can into ruin, bankruptcy, slavery, and what|ever else we have brought upon ourselves. These opi|nions cannot both be right, because they are diametri|cally opposite; but they may, and I hope are, both wrong.</P>
<P>It is the cant of the court.
<Q>Representation has always been inadequate; parliaments have long been septennial; place-men have sat long in the house.</Q>
So king <HI>Iohn</HI> told his barons,
<Q>The privileges granted by <HI>Henry</HI> I. have been long lost; you have been long
<PB N="271" REF="013851_1295_0F9E2CA2CFB42440">
in a state of very imperfect liberty.</Q>
So at the Revo|lution the <HI>Iacobites</HI> might have said,
<Q>The <HI>Stuart</HI> go|vernment has been long established. Why should the house of <HI>Orange</HI> be brought in, &amp;c.?</Q>
This way of arguing is all heels uppermost. The longer griev|ances have continued, the more reason for redressing them.</P>
<P>Ministers think themselves in duty bound to their utmost to persuade you, my good countrymen, that all is safe. Yet it is strange, that they should think you so very easy of belief, that they should put into certain speeches assertions so very liable to contradic|tion.
<Q>I can have no other interest, than to reign in the hearts of a free and happy people <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">SpEECH, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1771, <HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. IX.308.</NOTE></Q>
That a par|ticular prince may <HI>actually</HI> have, upon the whole, no interest different from that of his subjects, may be affirmed; but to say, he <HI>can</HI> have no other, or,
<Q>that it is not <HI>possible,</HI> he should think himself interested in pursuing measures hurtful to his subjects;</Q>
is assert|ing what all history confutes. If there were a natural impossibility in the prince's gaining by the subject's loss, (as it is impossible, for instance, the king of <HI>Ban|tam</HI> should be advantaged by <HI>Britain</HI>'s being too hea|vily taxed) this might have been affirmed. But will any man say, it can be no more advantage to one of our kings, than to the king of <HI>Bantam,</HI> that the civil list revenue be double? If this cannot be said, nei|ther can it be said, that our kings
<Q>can have no other interest, than to reign in the hearts of a free and happy people.</Q></P>
<P>Again, in the same spirit.
<Q>The support of our con|stitution is our common duty and interest. By that standard I would wish my people to try all public
<PB N="272" REF="013851_1296_0F9E2CA3949FD8A0">
principles and professions.</Q>
Excellent! If it were but well f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unded. But what is our constitution? <HI>Ans</HI> Government by king, lords, and commons. Do we enjoy the spirit and efficiency of this constitution? The king does no evil. But does not the <HI>court</HI> influ|ence the greatest part of our elections? Do not many of the lords extend their power beyond their own house, Can the house of commons be called even the shadow of a representation of the property of the people? Are septennial parliaments the constitution? Is a house of commons filled with placemen and pensioners the con|stitution? Is the <HI>ministry</HI>'s assuming in parliament the power and place of king, lords, and commons, the constitution? Will any man deny, that this has of late years been too much the state of things? Is not then a ministry's recommending the support of our constitution, while our constitution is almost annihi|lated, a solemn mockery? Is there any means for supporting the constitution, besides restoring it to its true spirit and efficiency by shortening parliaments, by making representation adequate, by incapacitating placemen and pensioners, &amp;c. Ought not these salu|tary reformations to have been the burden of this speech, of every speech, and not recommendations to the members to lull the people in their several coun|tries into a fatal security, which the speeches call sub|mission to government, and supporting the constitu|tion? Does not this shew you, my good countrymen, what hands you are in?</P>
<P>Compare the lullaby strain of this speech, with the complaints in the petition of the livery of <HI>London</HI> to the king, in the year 1769, two years before the date of the above speech. The speech represents all as safe and secure. But the speech is penned by those whose interest it is to have you believe that all is well. The
<PB N="273" REF="013851_1297_0F9E2CA530181A70">
petition comes from the independent, unbiassed peo|ple, who <HI>feel,</HI> that all is not well.</P>
<P>The chief complaints in it are, that the ministry had invaded the right of trial by jury; had made use of the illegal courses of general warrants, and seizure of papers; had evaded the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> act; had punished [<HI>Bingley</HI>] without trial, conviction, or sen|tence; had used the military, where the peace-officers were sufficient, and had murdered the subjects, whom they ought only to have apprehended; had screened murderers convict of their own party; had established unjust and arbitrary taxes in the colonies; had pro|cured the rejection from a seat in parliament, of a member no way unqualified by law, and the reception of one not chosen by a majority of the electors; had procured the payment of pretended deficiencies in the civil list without examination; had rewarded, instead of punishing, the public defaulter of unaccounted millions, &amp;c. Heavy grievances all! But these were not the worst. What they should have dwelt upon, was, inadequate representation, septennial parliaments, ministerial influence in parliament, &amp;c. Can it then be said, my good countrymen, that all is safe, and there is no need of any reformation?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Page,</HI> member for <HI>Chichester,</HI> in his very judi|cious farewell to his constituents, says,
<Q>the <HI>British</HI> constitution is going to ruin faster than perhaps ap|pears to the common eye <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">LOND. CHRON. <HI>October</HI> 2, 1767.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Again, it is said, by the lullers,
<Q>what probability that 800 men of property should enslave their coun|try?</Q></P>
<P>Who would have thought that the <HI>Roman</HI> senate, men of great property, would join the triumviri,
<PB N="274" REF="013851_1298_0F9E2CA77970AA88">
whose visible design was to enslave their country? Who would have thought, that, when <HI>Iulius</HI> was cut off, and a door again opened for the restoration of li|berty, the men of property would not all join the party of <HI>Brutus</HI> and <HI>Cassius?</HI> Who would have thought, that, when the men of property saw the army of <HI>Bru|tus</HI> and <HI>Cassius</HI> equal to that of the tyrant at <HI>Philippi,</HI> they should not all, as one man, repair to the standard of liberty?</P>
<P>The destroyers of the virtue and liberty of the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> brought that once virtuous and free people to think the imperial form of government necessary. A corrupt government in <HI>England</HI> may bring the peo|ple to wish to be rid of parliaments.</P>
<P><Q>The crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> was elective, and subject to a senate. In one day, it was, without any visible force, changed into hereditary, and absolute, no re|bellion, nor convulsion of state following <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burn.</HI> HIST. OWN TIMES, I.377.</NOTE>.</Q>
So soon may a nation lose its liberties. This was mentioned to <HI>Charles</HI> II. by his courtiers, when they encouraged him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o make himself absolute <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> was formerly elective, with narrow powers and prerogatives. Nobles and clergy, encroaching and tyrannical, used to decide their quarrels by private wars; which produced continual scenes of confusion and cruelty. <HI>Gustavus Ericson</HI> be|ing successful against the tyrannical <HI>Danes,</HI> who lorded it over <HI>Sweden</HI> and other countries, gains the affec|tions of the <HI>Swedes.</HI> They enlarge his privileges, to render him more powerful against the <HI>Danes.</HI> They give him church lands, and humble the tyrannical clergy. The reformation prevailing in <HI>Sweden, Gusta|vus</HI> takes the opportunity of demolishing the Roman
<PB N="275" REF="013851_1299_0F9E2CA92A39E408">
catholics, on pretence of favouring <HI>Luther. Gustavus</HI> thus becomes absolute, and the crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> here|ditary. Afterwards the crown was reduced again. After that, the senate was abolished by <HI>Charles</HI> IX. who becomes one of the most absolute princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> in consequence of a pretended misbehaviour of the senate. Thus the <HI>Swedish</HI> monarchs were once limited and elected; then absolute, and hereditary; then limited again; then absolute again; then limited after the ty|rant <HI>Charles</HI> IX. and then absolute in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> XII. and then limited again, and now totally enslaved. For <HI>Eleonora Ulrica,</HI> upon <HI>Charles</HI> XIIth's death, offered the states of <HI>Sweden</HI> conditions, if they would elect her, and set aside the duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> the more lineal heir. They elected and limited her effectually. But the people are enslaved still to the nobles, and the nation to the sovereign <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">MOD. UNIV. HIST. XXXIII.10, 13, 14.</NOTE>. So unsteady and fluctuating has the political barometer of <HI>Sweden</HI> been; and so variable and so precarious a thing is li|berty. Have you not then, my good countrymen, reason to be jealous of your liberties?</P>
<P>I cannot help considering judge <HI>Blackstone</HI> as one of the many among us, who endeavour to lull us a|sleep in this time of danger. I own I do not under|stand his ideas of free government.</P>
<P><Q>Wherever, says he <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">COM. I.244.</NOTE>, the law expresses its distrust of abuse of power, it always vests a superior coercive authority in some other hand to correct it; the very notion of which destroys the idea of sovereignty. If, therefore, for example, the two houses of parliament, or either of them, had avowedly a right to animadvert on the king, or each other, or if the king had a right to animadvert on either of the houses, that branch of
<PB N="276" REF="013851_1300_0F9E2CAB0C8EC478">
the legislature so subject to animadversion, would in|stantly cease to be part of the supreme power; the ba|lance of the constitution would be overturned; and that branch or branches, in which this jurisdiction re|sided, would be completely sovereign. The supposi|tion of <HI>law</HI> therefore is, that neither the king, nor ei|ther house of parliament (collectively taken) is capable of doing any wrong; since in such cases the law feels itself incapable of furnishing any adequate remedy. For which reason all oppressions, which may happen to spring from any branch of the sovereign power, must necessarily be out of the reach of any <HI>stated rule,</HI> or <HI>express legal</HI> provision; but if ever they unfortunately happen, the prudence of the times must provide new remedies upon new emergencies.</Q></P>
<P>Here the learned judge tells us, that, because nei|ther can the king exercise an arbitrary restraining power over either of the houses of parliament, nor either or both h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uses of parliament over the king,&mdash;therefore what?&mdash;Therefore
<Q>the supposition of <HI>law</HI> is, that none of the three branches of the legislature can do wrong, because the law feels itself incapable of fur|nishing an adequate remedy.</Q>
If the law, or the lawyers, suppose, that none of the three branches of the legislature is capable of doing wrong, for that they are supreme, and whatever the supreme power esta|blishes must of course be right, as none can say to the supreme power, what dost thou? yet history shews, that king, lords, and commons, have often (as was to be expected from the weakness of human nature) done very wrong things. And though the law
<Q>feels it|self incapable of furnishing any adequate remedy;</Q>
does it therefore follow, that there is no adequate re|medy? The judge says, the prudence of future times must find new remedies upon new emergencies; and
<PB N="277" REF="013851_1301_0F9E2CAB17B2E118">
afterwards adds, that we have a precedent in the Revo|lution of 1688, to shew what may be done if a king runs away, as <HI>Iames</HI> II. did. Insinuating, that, if we had not such a precedent, we should not know how to proceed in such a case; and says expressly, that
<Q>so far as this precedent leads, and no farther, we may <HI>now</HI> be allowed to lay down the <HI>law</HI> of redress against public oppression.</Q>
Yet he says, p. 245. that necessity and the safety of the whole, may require the exertion of those inherent (though latent) powers of society, which no climate, no time, no constitution, no contract, can ever destroy or diminish.' For my part, I cannot see the use of all this hesitating, and mincing the mat|ter. Why may we not say at once, that without any urgency of distress, without any provocation by op|pression of government, and though the safety of the whole should not appear to be in any immediate danger, if the people of a country think they should be, in any respect, happier under republican government, than monarchical, or under monarchical than republican, and find, that they can bring about a change of go|vernment, without greater inconveniencies than the fu|ture advantages are likely to balance; why may we not say, that they have a sovereign, absolute, and uncon|trolable right to change or new-model their govern|ment as they please? The authority of government, in short, is only superior to a minority of the people. The majority of the people are, rightfully, superior to it. Wherever a government assumes to itself a power of opposing the sense of the majority of the people, it declares itself a proper and formal tyranny in the fullest, strongest, and most correct sense of the word. I must therefore beg leave to submit to the public, whether the learned judge is not clearly erroneous in his meaning,
<PB N="278" REF="013851_1302_0F9E2CABF173D9E0">
as well as his words, when he says, p. 251, that <Q>na|tional distress alone can justify eccentrical remedies applied by the people.</Q> I think I may safely defy all the world to prove, that there is any necessity of any distress, or of any reason assigned for a people's alter|ing, at any time, the whole plan of government, that has been established in their country for a thousand years; besides their will and pleasure. I am not speak|ing of the <HI>prudence</HI> of such a step; nor do I justify a people's proposing to alter their constitution, if such alteration is likely to be followed by worse evils, than it is likely to redress; nor have I any thing to say con|cerning the difficulty of obtaining the real sense of the majority of a great nation. But I assert, that, saving the laws of prudence, and of morality, the people's mere absolute, sovereign will and pleasure, is a suffi|cient reason for their making any alteration in their form of government. The truth is therefore, that the learned judge has placed the sovereignty wrong, viz. in the government; whereas it should have been in the people, next, and immediately under God. For the people give to their governors all the rightful power they have. But no body ever heard of the governors giving power to the people. If the teachers of the ex|ploded doctrine of the divine right of kings, had taught the divine right of the people, they had stated that point in a just and proper manner.</P>
<P>The more impudent part of our court-men, if you express anxiety about the state of public liberty, will ask you, Whether you think the ministry are a set of <HI>Turks,</HI> who want to introduce at once the bamboo, and the bow-string, or a set of cannibals who want to eat all the friends of liberty? Hear the excellent lord <HI>Strange</HI> on the <HI>gradual</HI> and imperceptible, and there|fore

<P><Q>Whilst arbitrary power is in its infancy, and creep|ing up by degrees to man's estate, no doubt it will, it <HI>must,</HI> refrain from acts of violence and compulsion. It will by bribery gain the consent of these it has not as yet got strength enough to compel; but when it is by bribery grown up to its full strength and vi|gour, even bribery itself will be neglected, and who|ever then opposes its views will be ruined, either by open violence, or false informations, and cooked up prosecutions. I shall grant, Sir, that if the question were put in plain and direct terms, no man, or at least very few, would agree to give up their property in their estates for the sake of a much greater estate or pension depending upon the will of an arbitrary sovereign. But such a question never was, nor ever will be, put by those who aim at arbitrary power. They always find specious pretences for some new powers, or some little increase of power, and then another new power, or another little increase of power, till at last their power becomes by degrees un|controlable; and men of corrupt hearts, are by mer|cenary motives prevented from considering or fore|seeing the consequences of the new or additional powers they grant. It is, I think, highly probable, that <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> had laid the scheme of enslaving his country, before he obtained the province of <HI>Trans|alpine Gaul.</HI> For this purpose he rightly judged, that it was necessary to get a great army under his command, and by his continuance in success in that command, to render that army more attached to him than to the laws and liberties of their country. For
<PB N="280" REF="013851_1304_0F9E2CAE04CA9FA0">
obtaining that command, and for continuing in it, he knew he must depend upon the votes of his fel|low-citizens, If he had told his fellow-citizens, that he wanted from them such an army as might enable him to oppress the liberties of his country, they would certainly have refused it. Notwithstanding the avarice, luxury, and selfishness then prevailing amongst them, he could not by all his bribery have got them to agree to such a direct question. He therefore at first proposed to them only to give him the command of <HI>Cisalpine Gaul,</HI> with <HI>Illyria</HI> an|nexed, which by bribery, and by having insinuated himself into great favour with the people, he ob|tained; and by the same means he got the <HI>Transal|pine Gaul</HI> added to it. This gave him the command of a great army, and the people being blinded by his largesses and his successes, they continued him in that command, till he made his army so absolutely his own, that it established him in arbitrary power, and so effectually destroyed the liberties of the people, that they could never again be restored; for the short interval between his death and the establishment of his successor, <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> was no free or regular government, but a continued series of usurpation, murder, and civil war. If the people of <HI>Rome,</HI> Sir, had foreseen the consequences of their favours to <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> they would certainly have refused grant|ing him so many; but they were so blinded by their corruption, that they did not consider the conse|quences. This destroyed irrecoverably that glorious republic, and this will destroy every republic, where any one man has wealth or power enough to corrupt a great number of the people.</Q></P>
<P>It is the common cant of the court-sycophants, The army has never yet enslaved you. The laws,
<PB N="281" REF="013851_1305_0F9E2CAE0F87DC50">
which you thought so dangerous when first enacted, have not ruined you. What do you fear from the government?' &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now though we were to own that we are not yet ruined; though we should go so far as to hope against hope, that the national debt, for instance, instead of going on increasing, will, by some unknown means, be reduced; though we should grant the possibility of corruption's falling into disgrace, instead of its spread|ing wider and wider, as it has done in all the states where it has to a great degree prevailed; granting all this, and more, must we therefore say we are in a state of safety? The army is composed of <HI>Englishmen</HI>; the magistrates and peace officers are <HI>Englishmen.</HI> There is a native generosity in the hearts of ninety-nine in every hundred <HI>Englishmen,</HI> of the middling and lower ranks of life, which prevents their making a violent or unjustifiable use of power. But are we therefore obliged to traitorous ministers, who bribe worthless parliaments to keep up armies, and enact laws, which our good-nature only prevents our applying to mis|chievous purposes against one another? What should we think of those parents who gave their children leave to beat one another? Should we justify the pa|rents because the children, being of gentle tempers, had made no bad use of their liberty? Should we not every day, and every hour, expect to hear of some bad consequence from such management?</P>

<P>The <HI>French</HI> King had an army, and consequently power to compel the parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> to register his edicts, long before he actually attempted it. When

<P>Judge <HI>Blackstone</HI> says <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blackst.</HI> COM. IV.432.</NOTE>,
<Q>The constitution of <HI>Eng|land</HI> had arrived to its full vigour, and the true balance between liberty and prerogative was happily establish|ed by law in the reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II.</Q>
And that the people had as large a portion of real liberty as is con|sistent with a state of society, and sufficient power residing in their own hands, to assert and preserve that liberty, if invaded by the royal prerogative,' is evident, he thinks, from the people's effectually re|sisting <HI>Iames</HI> II. in his attempts to enslave th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, and obliging him to quit his enterprise and his throne to|gether. Now we know, that since the days of <HI>Iames</HI> II. a great deal has been pretended to be done for <HI>en|larging</HI> and <HI>strengthening</HI> liberty, and enabling the people to assert and preserve it. Judge <HI>Blackstone</HI> fills two large pages with only the heads of what has been done since the Revolution for the advantage of
<PB N="284" REF="013851_1308_0F9E2CB4822EEA08">
public liberty, and of private justice; as the bill of rights; the toleration-act; the act of settlement; the union of the two kingdoms; the confirming and ex|emplifying the doctrine of resistance; establishing the authority of the laws, and maintenance of the consti|tution above the royal prerogative; overthrowing the sovereign's dispensing power; religious toleration, [which however is still miserably defective] exclusion of many placemen from the house of commons [ano|ther improvement likewise very defective], and many others. So that in our times, the people ought to have much more power of redress in their own hands, than they had in those days. How is it then, that it is so common to hear the condition of our country given up as desperate? Are we in a worse situation than in the days of <HI>Iames</HI> II.?</P>
<P>If we be more corrupt than in the days of <HI>Iames</HI> II. if the court has more to give, and the members of the house of commons are more ready to receive, than in those days; and if, besides, we have more to fear from the army than our fathers before the Revolution, we are in a worse situation for resisting tyranny than they were, and are only in a more eligible state, in as much as the character of the princes of the house of <HI>Hanover</HI> is less form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dable to liberty than that of the <HI>Stuarts.</HI> This, then, is the slender thread upon which the freedom of the once illustrious <HI>British</HI> empire is sus|pended. Our liberties lie at the footstool of the throne, but our kings and ministers have hitherto been either too timid or too good to seize them.</P>
<P>Even the learned commentator himself, who shews no disposition to find fault without reason, finishes his encomium on the improvements which law and liberty have gained since the Revolution, with the alarming words which follow:
<Q>Though these provisions have
<PB N="285" REF="013851_1309_0F9E2CB628857578">
nominally, and, in appearance, reduced the strength of the executive power to a much lower ebb, than in the preceding period; if, on the other hand, we throw into the opposite scale (what perhaps the immo|derate reduction of the antient prerogative may have rendered in some degree necessary) the vast acquisition of force arising from the riot-act, and the annual ex|pedience of a standing army; and the vast acquisition of personal attachment, arising from the magnitude of the national debt, and the manner of levying those yearly millions that are appropriated to pay the inte|rest; we shall find that the crown has gradually and imperceptibly gained almost as much in influence as it has apparently lost in prerogative <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blackst.</HI> COMM.

<P>Upon this paragraph I cannot help making a few strictures. What may the learned judge mean by the <HI>immoderate</HI> reduction of the antient prerogative? Have not the <HI>people</HI> power to fix the prerogative of their kings where they please? Is that immoderate, or in any re|spect wrong, which pleases the people? If a king thinks his prerogative too much retrenched by his peo|ple, has he any thing to do but decline the crown, and leave it to one who will accept it with such limi|tations as shall please the people, who have a right to be pleased?</P>
<P>Again, when the learned judge was summing up the disadvantages to liberty, which have arisen since the Revolution, how could he miss taking notice of the greatest, viz. The total loss of the parliament's effi|ciency (the present always excepted) for resisting court influence, and obtaining for the people whatever laws and regulations they may think necessary for their safety?</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="013851_1310_0F9E2CB651566290">The difference between the condition of the <HI>British</HI> empire with an independent parliament, and with a parliament influenced, not to say <HI>enslaved,</HI> by a design|ing court, is so great, that it may be said to be the whole.

<P>Some among us are ever magnifying the great ad|vantages we gained by the Revolution; thereby insi|nuating, that we do not want any farther improve|ments upon public liberty.</P>
<P>So our bishops, and other high-church-men, are always celebrating the great advantages which religion gained by the Reformation, in order to damp our pursuit of what (as has lately been made fully to ap|pear) we still want to set us upon a foot tolerably fa|vourable to truth, and liberty of conscience.</P>
<P>But without disparagement to the great and unde|niable advantages we gained by the expulsion of the <HI>Stuarts,</HI> it must be owned, that the Revolution was but an imperfect redress of grievances.</P>
<P>Let us hear Lord <HI>Perceval</HI> on the subject:</P>
<P><Q>The Revolution,
says he in the house of Com|mons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1744, was brought about so suddenly, and in such a manner, that it is rather a wonder, that
<PB N="287" REF="013851_1311_0F9E2CB70DEC21F8">
we gained what we did, than that we gained no more.</Q> The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was in effect our King the moment that he landed; backed with a great army, supported by men who, having called him in, could not quarrel with him without ruining themselves. It was too late to make terms with a Prince who was already possessed of the regal power, and who plainly shewed, that though he desired to be ruled by law, he still intended that the law should not bear much harder upon the crown during his reign, than it had done in former times <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alm.</HI> DEB. COM. I.273.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whilst some false brethren among us sooth us to repose by telling us all is well, others on the contrary affect, as above ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erved, to conclude all endeavours vain for recovering a state so far gone as the <HI>British</HI> in luxury and corruption. Thus we find a pretence, of one kind or another, for deserting our country.</P>
<P>States, they cry, have their old age, decay, and death, as individuals. And when the fatal hour is come, the efforts of the physician, and of the patriot, prove equally ineffectual.</P>
<P>We know, that the health and life of the individual are limited within the boundaries of seventy or eighty years; that a few, a very few, exceed those limits; and that no individual since the deluge has reached two hundred. But the durations of states regulate by no laws of nature; nor can my inestimable friend Dr. <HI>Price</HI> construct any tables of the physical probabilities of the continuance of kingdoms or commonwealths. His sagacity can reach no farther than to affirm, that any country will continue free, while it deserves to be free, and contrariwise.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="013851_1312_0F9E2CB7CDBED068">The affairs of nations seldom continue long in the same condition. When tyranny goes beyond a certain pitch, it sometimes draws upon itself the united ven|geance of the people, which crushes it. When liberty degenerates into lawless corruption of manners, a na|tion becomes the prey of the ambition and tyranny either of an overgrown subject, or of a foreign invader. This unsteadiness of human affairs is caused either by a constitution originally deficient, and ill-balanced, or by a deviation from the intent and spirit of a constitu|tion originally good.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> is of opinion, that the <HI>British</HI> constitution must come to an exit; and thinks it is more to be de|sired, that it should end in absolute monarchy, than in such a republican scheme as that set up by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> which he thinks the best we have to expect in case of a dissolution of the present <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">ESS.

<P>The constitution of the Republic of <HI>Venice</HI> is repre|sented by some historians as having continued free, with very little variation, excepting some of the im|proving sort, these thirteen hundred years. Others differ with respect to the period.</P>
<P>The means which have kept the <HI>Venetians</HI> so long free, in spite of ambition within, and the attacks of potent neighbours, are alledged by historians to be, 1. Their attachment to the original principles on which the Republic was established. 2. Their wisdom in keeping clear of quarrels among other States. 3. The senators being obliged to rise gradually through all stations, so that they never come to the management ignorant of business. 4. The impossibility of coming to power in any indirect manner. 5. The total exclu|sion of priests from all stations of power and trust.

6. The judicious distribution of the public revenues, and impossibility of embezzling them. 7.

The dreadful danger of the least attempt toward a change in the state. 9. Punishing capitally every degree of corruption; even the ambassadors from foreign countries being obliged to give a strict account of all monies, or presents, re|ceived by them. 10.

The strict limitation of the doge, senate, and all persons in power, so that they can do nothing, but what is warranted by law and constitu|tion. 12. Voting by ballot. 13.

<P>The Abb&eacute; <HI>S. Pierre</HI> thinks, the opinion, That states, like individuals, are naturally perishable, and that the <HI>greatness</HI> of a state naturally brings on its ruin, is a vulgar error. The permanency of states depends, he thinks, on their original good constitution, and subsequent faithful administration <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">UVR. POLIT. IX.12.</NOTE>. To which I will add, that most depends on an original sound constitu|tion, securing effectually the exclusion of corruption. For, as to administration, most kings will be tyrants, and the greatest part of ministers corruptors, if the people will suffer them.</P>
<P>The excellent <HI>Davenant</HI> (ii.294.) writes on this subject as follows:</P>

<Q>Men, when they are worn out with diseases, aged, crazy, and when besides they have the <HI>mala stamina vitae,</HI> may be patched up for a while, but they can|not hold out long; for life, though it is shortened by irregularities, is not to be extended by any care be|yond such a period.

ESS. IV. p. 27.</NOTE>.' And a|gain, Legislators ought not to trust the future govern|ment of a state entirely to chance; but ought to pro|vide a system of laws to regulate the administration of public affairs to the latest posterity. Effects will al|ways correspond to causes; and wise regulations in a commonwealth are the most valuable legacy that can be left to future ages. In the smallest court, or office, the stated forms and methods in which business must be conducted, are found to be a considerable check on the natural depravity of mankind: Why should not the case be the same in public affairs? Can we ascribe the stability of the <HI>Venetian</HI> government, through so many ages, to any thing but its form? And is it not easy to point out those defects in the original constitution, which produced the tumults in

<P>Whilst a people continue capable of liberty, the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iod of their ruin will never approach.</P>
<P>It is therefore more melancholy to see public virtue lost in a people, where the people, as in <HI>England,</HI> have power in government, than to see a tyrant on the throne, with the people's liberties under his feet. He may reform. He may die. The fury of a brave and incensed people may rise, like a whirlwind, and scatter him and his enslaving crew like chaff.

<P><Q>The state of <HI>France</HI> (says <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> on the passage) was then even worse than the state of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is now: the debts as heavy, many of the provinces en|tirely exhausted, and none of them in a condition of bearing any new imposition. The standing revenues broug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t into the king's coffers no more than thirty millions, though an hundred and fifty millions were raised on the people; so great were the abuses of that government in raising of money: and they were not less in the dispensation of it.

<P>Our modern court-sycophants are many years too late in applying their maxims of <HI>Quietum non movere, nolumus mutari leges Angliae,</HI> and the like. These rules are good, while a kingdom or commonwealth stands firm upon its original foundation. But when the constitution is unhinged, when the first principles on which a state was established, are annihilated, when the only security of the people's liberties is turn|ed against the people, to insist, that nothing shall be altered, is to insist, that whatever is gone into disor|der, shall remain in disorder. The time to urge those maxims was, when the first disorders were introduc|ed, when bribes, places, and pensions were first given to members of parliament.</P>
<P><HI>Montesquieu</HI> observes. that it was constitutional a|mong the antient <HI>Cretans</HI> to correct the abuses which crept into their government, by the people's rising in arms, and forcing their corrupt magistrates to resign.

<P>I hope therefore, my good countrymen, you will not let yourselves be discouraged from using the proper means for restoring the constitution, by such frivolous objections as these; and that you will remember, that restoration is not alteration, and that antiquity is a rea|son for removing abuses, not for keeping them up.</P>

the eternal cant of the tools of power, the friends of mankind will advise the strength|ening the hands of the <HI>people,</HI> as all history, and every day's experience shews us, that government is too strong for the people.</P>
<P>The people can never be too jealous of their liber|ties. Power is of an elastic nature, ever extending itself and encroaching on the liberties of the subjects. And it has accordingly, in most ages and nations, over|whelmed them. The <HI>inertia</HI> of the people is the op|portunity of the government. And the people have ever been too inactive in their own defence; which is incomparably the more dangerous error of the two. For if the people secure the power in their own hands, their dethroning a king, oversetting a government, or even massacring a court, with all its connexions (though such scenes revolt humanity) these are only temporary horrors, thunderstorms which soon clear

off; and the people restore the serenity of a better state of things. Whereas tyranny is a permanent evil, di|stressing and debasing the human species from genera|tion to generation, and deluging the world in a never ebbing sea of blood.</P>
<P>It is difficult to rouse the people to an apprehension of danger. And if, headed by a spirit of an unusal boldness, they do rise like a whirlwind, and sweep away the combination against their liberties; they often, by trusting power too far or too long in the hands of their deliverers, give them the hint to erect themselves, like <HI>Cromwell</HI> and others, into tyrants, and to rivet on the unhappy people the very fetters they had just before knocked off. But desperate dis|eases require desperate remedies.</P>
<P>A vote of credit given a king of <HI>Spain,</HI> suggested to him, with the help of the d&mdash;l, the inspirer of all such thoughts, that he had no occasion to depend on the cortes, or parliaments, for supplies. This ruined the <HI>Spanish</HI> liberties.</P>

deluge. Of that great patron of liberty, the Antient Universal Historians write as follows:</P>
<P><Q>Thus fell <HI>Brutus,</HI> in the 43d year of his age, and with him fell the liberty of <HI>Rome,</HI> and of the <HI>Roman</HI> people. He was a man in whom the malice of his enemies could discern no fault, in whom the virtues of humanity were eminent; in whom a constant, firm, and inviolable attachment to the public good, formed the principal and most distinguishable part of his character, and the uninterrupted business of his life ever in view, ever pursued from the inherent equity of his mind; for he was, as his historian well observes, by nature exactly framed for virtue, with|out one breach of that never to be omitted distinction of <HI>fas</HI> and <HI>nefas,</HI> right and wrong. And here it may not be altogether foreign to our purpose, to illustrate this transcendent rectitude of his mind, by instancing his refusal, contrary to the opinion of <HI>Cicero</HI> and his other friends, to employ the arts of oratory in gild|ing over the fairest cause, when after the death of <HI>Caesar</HI> he addressed himself to the <HI>Roman</HI> people. It cannot be supposed that <HI>Brutus,</HI> who had long been famed for eloquence, could be ignorant of speaking to the passions of men, an art too successfully made use of by <HI>Antony</HI> on the same occasion. Such, then, was the integrity of <HI>Brutus</HI>'s mind, that he could not stoop to employ any indecent means even in the pur|suit of virtue. The death of <HI>Caesar</HI> was undoubtedly justifiable under the government which then prevailed in <HI>Rome,</HI> notwithstanding all the dirt that has been thrown at this transaction by the mean and groveling abettors of arbitrary power. We may see what the <HI>Romans,</HI> and <HI>Tully</HI> the least adventurous of men, thought of this action by a passage in one of his let|ters to his friend <HI>Atticus,</HI> bemoaning the misfortunes

of the times, when he says, But notwithstanding the cloud that hangs over us, I console myself in the ides of <HI>March.</HI> Our heroes have done every thing within their power, and with a resolution by which they have acquired immortal glory. Nor was the putting the destroyer of their constitution and liber|ties to death, by violent hands, without precedent in the <HI>Roman</HI> history. And as to the method they made choice of, it appears adequate to the dignity of the action; for who more proper to compass such an event, than a number of senators distinguished by their attachment to liberty? Or what place could be more justly fixed on for the tyrant of <HI>Rome</HI> to expire in, than than dictatorial chair which he possessed in violation of the laws of his country? We often see the love of one's country the bent and inclination of very different men, influenced either by passion, acri|mony of temper, vanity, resentment, a lust of power, or any other inducement; nor were all those who joined in that glorious cause, altogether free from such suspicions; for an uniform, steady, constant attachment to the public good, was to be met with in <HI>Brutus</HI> alone. Men generally differ from them|selves as much as from one another; <HI>Brutus</HI> was al|ways the same. If we have dwelt too long in con|sidering the virtues of this great man, the mighty excellence of his character, and his inviolable at|tachment to the public cause, may plead our excuse. We are not only indebted to history for the enlarge|ment of our minds, but likewise for the improvement of our moral virtues; and to an <HI>Englishman,</HI> the fore|most of the rank is the pursuit of liberty.

When the <HI>Pope</HI> touched upon the string of sovereignty over them, they acted with the same

spirit against him as they had done against the empe|rors and their own tyrants; and what is most incre|dible in that bigotted age, his fulminations and inter|dicts served but to increase their unanimity in des|pising them, while in other countries they were de|throning princes, and subverting constitutions. Next to this the great character of the <HI>Florentines</HI> consisted in the good faith with which they fulfilled all their engagements, and in their passion for freeing all the other states of <HI>Italy</HI> from tyranny. The <HI>Floren|tines</HI> always took the lead amongst the states of <HI>Italy</HI>; but it ought to be mentioned, to their honour, that we have not upon record any act of unprovoked op|pression, that they were guilty of, towards their neigh|bours; nor do we know one instance of their infring|ing the terms upon which any pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple came into their alliance, or under their protection <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">MOD.

<P><HI>Florence</HI> in a manner supported the liberty of <HI>Tuscany.</HI> She paid immense subsidies. Kept armies on foot. And yet her citizens out-vied all <HI>Europe,</HI> in the splen|dor and elegance of their equipages, in their manner of living, in their buildings, and public exhibitions, in which they imitated the <HI>Trojan</HI> games, so finely de|scribed by <HI>Virgil,</HI> and common amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI> who were the patterns of the <HI>Florentine</HI> policy, both in peace and war; but with this advantage in favour of the latter, that they were a commercial state <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 175.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Florence was, at that time, at a very high pitch of happiness and prosperity. Her people were rich, power|ful, united and flourishing in learning, arts, and sci|ences; all this prosperity was owing to the wisdom and virtue of a private citizen, <HI>Lorenzo de Medici.</HI> The tranquillity of this country was such, that it afforded no

events proper for history to record, unless we mention the encouragement given to men of learning, who filled the country with writings, and works, that will ever be the admiration of mankind. <HI>Lorenzo</HI> resem|bled his illustrious predecessors in their public and private virtues, but exceeded them in personal accom|plishments, He had a turn for military affairs, though peace was his darling object. Compositions are still extant, that prove him to have been both a poet and a critic. He was a good judge of architecture, which in his time was commonly combined with painting; and of music. He founded the university of <HI>Pisa,</HI> to which he brought the most learned and ingenious men in <HI>Italy.</HI> He is said to have been more amorous than was consistent with the strict practice of virtue; and like other great men of antiquity, unbent his more serious hours with juvenile recreations. To amuse his busy pragmatical countrymen, and to render <HI>Florence</HI> more populous, he exhibited justs, tournaments, plays, and other diversions, which reconciled them, in a great measure, to that aristocracy of which they were so na|turally jealous.</P>

<P>The <HI>Florentines</HI> were, at last, split into a thousand factions about resettling their form of government. They seemed to look back with surprise and horror at their situation, under the family of the <HI>Medici</HI>; they did not consider the advantages brought to their coun|try, as an equivalent for the interruption which they had given to the power of the people.

<P>The human mind (<HI>Buchanan</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">DE JURE REGNI, &amp;c.</NOTE> says) has something sublime and generous implanted in it by nature, which impels it to resist unjust power.

He labours to shew, that the apostolical directions to the christians, concerning submission to kings and magi|strates, are no argument against resisting tyrants; but a caution to the professors of the new religion, that
<PB N="322" REF="013851_1346_0F9E2CE3524542E8">
they must not think themselves exempted thereby from the duty of peaceable subjects; and he shews, that what is said in honour of the supreme magistrate, as appointed of God, and bearing the sword for punish|ing the wicked, &amp;c. does not relate to the infamous <HI>Roman</HI> tyrants of those times; but to the office, ab|stracted from him who bore it. He mentions the di|vine order, 2 CHRON.

And he insists, that, as in holy writ, there are general orders for cutting off all irre|claim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bly wicked persons, without any exception in favour of kings; it must follow, that tyrants are, in obedience to scripture authority, to be cut off. He approves of the putting to death of <HI>Iames</HI> III. of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> for his cruelty and wickedness, and of the regu|lations made for securing those, who destroyed him, and mentions, that twelve, or more of the Scottish kings, were condemned to perpetual prison, or banish|ment, or death, for their crimes.</P>
<P>It is an unsurmountable argument against slavery, that nature, in every human being, revolts against it, when it comes to touch himself. We wonder to read of dastardly people, and crafty priests, standing up for the divine right of tyrants, as if they forgot, that by and by themselves may come to be sufferers. But the partisans of tyranny keep always a mental reservation in their own favour. They are for enslaving all man|kind, and intend that themselves shall be little tyrants under the great one. Even among the ecclesiastics, the zealous trumpeters of passive obedience in all ages and
<PB N="323" REF="013851_1347_0F9E2CE414A074E0">
countries, whenever those clumsy kings, who had not sense enough to keep to the fundamental maxim, That the king and the priest are to play the game into one anothers hands, or those few, very few noble minded princes, who have been above the meanness of both king craft and priest-craft, have broken in upon what churchmen call their sacred prerogative, and proposed to put them, either as to taxes or incomes, nearly upon a foot with the laity, we always find, that slavery is a very terrible affair; kings, who use freedom with their sacred order, are tyrants; and heaven is appeal|ed to in vindication of their quarrel. Of this the reader will see instances in these collections.</P>
<P>There is always a somewhat, where human nature, even in the most feeble spirits; vindicates to itself its unalienable right. The following private anecdote, told me by one who knew the parties concerned, il|lustrates this.</P>
<P>In the mad times of <HI>Sacheverel,</HI> when many seemed willing to go all lengths in obedience to authority, a man of sense took some pains to give a lady, a friend of his, juster notions than she had of the limits of obedience.
<Q>Suppose,</Q>
says he,
<Q>Madam, that the king should seize, by a <HI>quo warranto,</HI> your husband's estate, and make him, and yourself, and children, beggars; would you think resistance unlawful?</Q>
<Q>I should have much cause of complaint,</Q>
says the lady;
<Q>but,</Q>
(raising her pretty eyes to heaven)
<Q>we must not resist the Lord's anointed.</Q>
<Q>But, Madam, I will put a harder case still. Suppose the king should force your ladyship into his bed, don't you think your hus|band might lawfully promote an associatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for extir|pating such a brutish <HI>Tarquin?</HI></Q>
The lady, with down|cast eyes, and a countenance covered with a rosy blush, answered:
<Q>The case you now put, Sir, is undoubt|edly
<PB N="324" REF="013851_1348_0F9E2CE4CF7C66B8">
harder than the former. But, as the whole sin should be the king's, and kings are answerable to God only, I do not think, my husband could lawfully do any thing toward vindicating his honour by violence.</Q>
The gentleman knowing, that the lady was, as all the votaries of passive obedience, staunch for the esta|blished church, and bitter, if a lady can be bitter, against the dissenters, resolved to put to her one ques|tion farther, which he did as follows:
<Q>Give me leave, Madam,
says he, to ask you once more; Suppose the king should order your ladyship to go to meeting?</Q>
<Q>What,
(says she, rising in a lovely passion, which enlivened every feature, with eyes sparkling, lips quivering, and bosom heaving)
me to a wicked schismatical presbyterian meeting!</Q>
(These opprob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|ous words she had learned from the parson of the pa|rish.)
<Q>I would kill him,</Q>
(says she, clenching her little, weak, soft hand, which made the gentleman hope he should have the pleasure of a box on the ear, of which however he was disappointed)
<Q>if I were to die for it, sooner than he should make me enter the door of a conventicle.</Q></P>
<P>If a weak delicate woman could be thus roused in defence of what she called her religious liberty, sure|ly a man ought to suffer emasculation as soon as to yield himself a voluntary slave.</P>
<P>Hardly any people ever were so sordid, as not to shew some love of liberty. Even the <HI>Polish</HI> peasants, <HI>A. D</HI> 1620, oppressed by their tyrannical lords, fled to the <HI>Ukraine,</HI> where there was more freedom <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">MOD. UNIV. HIST. XXXIV.198.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>However indifferent about the welfare of his country a man may be in his heart, it seems strange, that any man should fairly <HI>declare</HI> himself so. For he who owns himself unconcerned about the liberty and happiness of
<PB N="325" REF="013851_1349_0F9E2CE61059B6F8">
so many millions of his fellow-creatures, (many of whom are persons of amiable characters, and connected with himself by the most endearing ties,) declares him|self an unfeeling, sordid, selfish brute, hardened against natural affection, and incapable of every generous, every tender, and virtuous attachment. One would think, instead of making such a character a man's boast, there should not any where be found a human being, who should not be enraged at the imputation of such baseness of disposition.</P>
<P>Here let it be observed, at what a frightful rate of velocity we degenerate.
<Q>The <HI>love</HI> of our <HI>country,</HI> or <HI>public spirit,</HI> (says Mr. <HI>Gordon</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cato</HI>'s LETT. II.11.</NOTE>,) is a phrase in <HI>every body</HI>'s <HI>mouth,</HI> but it is talked of without being felt.</Q>
Mr. <HI>Gordon</HI> wrote this, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1721. So miserably are we sunk in half a century, that scarce any body now <HI>mentions</HI> love of country for any other purpose than to turn it to ridicule</P>
<P><Q>Whatever character we may have,</Q>
says Mr. Alder|man <HI>Heathcote,</HI> in his speech in the house, <HI>A.D.</HI> 174<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,
<Q>or whatever character we may deserve among fo|reigners, I hope we shall always take care to preserve the character of being a brave and a free people. Foreign slaves may think as highly as they please, Sir, of the steadiness of their public councils; but among such, I hope, we shall always be deemed a turbulent and unsteady people. This character must always necessarily attend a free government; because in all such governments, there have been, there will always be, some minister, or some set of ministers, forming schemes for overturning the liberties of the people, and establishing themselves in arbitrary power. Such men are generally at first the idols of the people, and before their latent designs come to be discovered, they
<PB N="326" REF="013851_1350_0F9E2CE685067BD8">
generally prevail with the people to enter into such measures, or to make such regulations as may contri|bute to the success of their designs. But if the people are wise enough, and sufficiently jealous of their liber|ties, as the people of this country, thank God! have always hitherto been, they never fail to discover these designs before they are ripe for execution. As soon as they have made this discovery, they begin to see the evil tendency of the measures or regulations they have been led into, and of course they must alter the former and repeal the latter. This therefore which foreign slaves, as most of the people around us, impute to a turbulency or unsteadiness in our temper, is nothing but the natural effect of the freedom of our govern|ment; and whilst the cause lasts, which I hope it will always do, the effect must continue the same.</Q></P>
<P>And will you, my good countrymen, will the brave and generous spirited <HI>English,</HI> so soon after the expul|sion of popery and slavery, will you submit to be en|slaved by a handful of your fellow-subjects? You, who have so often made the mighty monarchs of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> tremble on their thrones, and so lately have made <HI>Europe</HI> stand aghast, are you not ashamed to shew yourselves afraid of a <HI>Harley,</HI> a <HI>Walpole,</HI> a <HI>Pel|ham,</HI> a <HI>Bute,</HI> a <HI>North?</HI> For either you were afraid of them, or you suffered yourselves to be deceived by them, which is almost as shameful; or you would, before now, have demanded, and obtained, either by petition or by force, the correction of the ruinous abuses I have, in these volumes, pointed out.</P>
<P>Besides the general reluctance in the people against commotions or alterations in public affairs, occasioned by their timidity, indolence, and want of public spirit; there are certain bodies of men in the nation, who
<PB N="327" REF="013851_1351_0F9E2CE7720DB880">
think themselves particularly interested in opposing all such proccedings, viz. the proprietors of stocks, the placemen, pensioners, expectants, and other depen|dants on the court, the established clergy, the army, and the inhabitants of the rotten boroughs, who now make a rich harvest, every seven years, by sending up a majority of the house of commons.</P>
<P>Whenever opposition is made to an apparently wise reformation, let the people look that corruption be not at the bottom. When the Mareschal <HI>d'Humieres</HI> had over-run the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> appeared to be in the utmost danger from the arms of <HI>France,</HI> the villanous magistrates of <HI>Amsterdam, Leyden, Delft,</HI> &amp;c. bribed (as by intercepted letters appeared) with French money, still opposed the raising of an armament, fear|ing, as they pretended, to trust the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> with an army. The Prince, from despair, and fear of utter ruin to his country, attempted to obtain au|thority for raising an army by a plurality of voices, whereas by the constitution unanimity is absolutely necessary. This proposal had almost lost the Prince his whole popularity. His enemies alledged, that, from motives of ambition, he meant to overthrow the constitution of his country. Shortly after this, he intercepted letters from <HI>D'Avaux,</HI> the French ambassador, to the king his master, with accounts of money disbursed by him in corrupting those patriotic magistrates, so jealous of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s am|bition. This turned the tide in favour of the Prince and his proposed armament against <HI>France.</HI> In the same manner, my good countrymen, whenever you observe men expressing great fear lest the redress of undoubted and ruinous grievances should produce fatal consequences; look, whether those cautious patriots
<PB N="328" REF="013851_1352_0F9E2CE869D1DF20">
are not already, or do not expect to be gainers by pre|sent measures and present men. If you find this to be the case, let every word those gentlemen say against measures for redress, go for nothing. They are inte|rested.</P>
<P>If it be urged, that those who now depend on places will be undone by the proposed reformation, it may be answered, That it is easy to provide in a moderate way for the necessitous; and that the others may drink port instead of claret. The dependents on the court, though very numerous, much too numerous, are but a hand|ful, compared with the great multitude, who have neither hopes nor fears from the ministry. In the year 1714, most of the merchants and monied men were for the <HI>Hanover</HI> succession, and against the Ja|cobites; because they thought their property would be most likely to be safe under protestant kings. In our times, we see many of the monied men against their country's good. Our men of property in the public funds, oppose whatever can be offered for re|storing independency to parliament, which alone can give hope of getting our finances put into order. If you go to altering any thing, they cry, it will produce disturbance, and then public credit may suffer. But will public credit be safe, if you do not alter any thing? Such men as <HI>Price,</HI> and <HI>Hume,</HI> and <HI>Grenville,</HI> who have hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s for calculation, will tell you, that in the way we have hitherto conducted our money-matters, there is the highest probability of a national bank|ruptcy. And the excellent <HI>Price,</HI> particularly, tells you, that it is not yet too late to save the nation. But he tells you, at the same time, that nothing will save it but the faithful application of a fund for diminshing the debts and taxes. And every body knows, that no|thing
<PB N="329" REF="013851_1353_0F9E2CE88C5A71F0">
make a ministry faithful, but the fear of an indepen|dent parliament. Yet our men of property in the funds are afraid of proposals for rendering our parliaments independent. This is literally <HI>ne moriare mori.</HI> It is resolving to sit still, till the house tumbles in ruins upon our heads, because being old and crazy, we are afraid of propping it up.</P>
<P>It is true, that many of those whose property is chiefly in the funds, are disposed to put the negative on all proposals for alterations even for the better. They are apprehensive, that in the concussion of reforma|tions and restorations, public credit may be affected, by which they may come to be losers.</P>
<P>Were public credit upon a sure foundation at pre|sent, it might be pretended that it is prudent to avoid what may be likely to shake it. If a patient is in a fair way toward recovery, there is no occasion to dis|turb his slumbers, for the sake of his taking medicines. But if he is in a lethargy, it would be strange practice to let him sleep on. Can any man of common under|standing look upon our public funds as in a state of safety, while the nation, with all that belongs to it, lies at the mercy of a profligate court, and in the power of a set of blundering ministers, who are pur|suing measures, the natural tendency of which is, To prejudice trade, and consequently to lesson the na|tional income, on which public credit depends? No certainly. On the contrary, the only means for se|curing public credit, are, first, to associate for its sup|port, as was done on occasion of the rebellion in 1745, (this ought not to be put off one day,) and then to associate for such redress of grievances, and such a resto|ration of the constitution, especially respecting the house of commons, as will of course put public credit and
<PB N="330" REF="013851_1354_0F9E2CEC506DBFE0">
every thing else, upon a very different foot from the present. In forming a national association, it will not be amiss to make a proviso, that all public creditors who join the association, shall have certain preferen|ces, and other advantages, not to be allowed to those who decline.</P>
<P>The established clergy in every country, are gene|rally the greatest enemies to all kinds of reformations, as they are generally the most narrow-minded and most worthless <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The oppositon lately shewn by the clergy of <HI>England</HI> to an enlarge|ment of religious liberty proves, that this maxim is equally just, when applied to the clergy of this, as of other countries. In the course of my reading, in order to make the collection, of which I have pub|lished a part, I could not help setting down as many proofs of this observation, as would make two volumes in octavo. Had our clergy behaved themselves as they ought on the late occasion, I should have had thoughts of mercy toward them, and probably should have sup|pressed what I had collected to their disadvantage. But as they have lately shewn themselves enemies to religious liberty, I think it is every honest man's duty to do all he can to detect and defeat their mischief. At the same time that I am thus severe on the body of the established clergy of this and other countries, I own with pleasure, that I have been happy in the friendship of many excellent men of that order, who really believed what they subscribed and professed, which was the case of my most venerable parent, whose memory will ever be sacred with me.</NOTE> set of men in every country. For|tunately for the present times, the wings of clerical power and influence are pretty close trimmed; so that I do not think their opposition to the proposed refor|mations could be of any great consequence, more of the people being inclined to despise than to follow them blindly.</P>
<P>The most formidable opposition to the proposed re|dress of grievances may be apprehended likely to come
<PB N="331" REF="013851_1355_0F9E2CEDD9281FE0">
from the standing army, the great instrument of slavery, without which no people ever were enslaved&punc; But even this formidable difficulty does not appear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nsurmountable; of which in the sequel.</P>
<P>A tyrant, says <HI>Aristotle</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">POLIT. V.11.</NOTE>, cannot be overthrown, but by agreement among the people. Therefore all tyrants [whether kings, grandees, or ministers,] la|bour to keep up dissensions and parties among the peo|ple. <HI>Aristotle</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. V.12.</NOTE> thinks the most precarious species of tyranny is that which is supported by a few, as be|ing particularly exposed to the envy of the people, and liable to contests among themselves. A corrupt par|liamentary government is a sort of oligarchy, and if we will take <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s word, not so formidable as some other kinds of tyranny.</P>
<P>I wish it may not be found, that the wickedness of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me and the folly of others among us, have produc|ed a ground of opposition and party-spirit of a peculiar kind, the effects of which may disturb our measures for procuring redress.</P>
<P>It is an old and vulgar error, That opposition and party are necessary in a free state. It is true, that when the government is of the common character of governments, that is, a junto of artful and pushing grandees, who have thrust themselves into the ma|nagement, in order to enrich themselves and their fa|milies; it is very necessary that there should be a party to detect and expose their schemes and machinations against the country. But this is only saying, that one evil is necessary to balance another evil. Nobody ever thought an opposition necessary in a private fa|mily,
<PB N="332" REF="013851_1356_0F9E2CEE9305A8D0">
where the heads have nothing but the good of the family in view. Sound politics therefore direct, not to set up one party against another, the one to battle against the other; but to take away the fewel of parties, the emolumentary invitations to the fatal and mischievous strife, in which every victory is a loss to the country.</P>
<P><Q>It is amazing, says <HI>Schoock</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">RESP. ACHAEOR, p. 79.</NOTE>, that though history shews so many kingdoms and commonwealths ruined by civil discord, yet we see, in many countries, a set of men, blinded by pride and ambition, forcing their country upon this fatal rock; and the people still as thoughtless of the danger, as if there were no warn|ings of it upon record.</Q></P>

From history we should learn, that <HI>Cyrus,</HI> called in by the <HI>Carians</HI> to quell a civil broil, enslaved that country; that the <HI>Romans</HI> took the same advantage of subjecting to their yoke the states of <HI>Greece</HI>; many others involved in domestic quarrels, which that ambitious people artfully fomented; that the aristo|cracy of the <HI>Rhegians</HI> in this manner lost their liber|ties; that the <HI>Seleucians,</HI> while they agreed among themselves, despised the <HI>Parthians,</HI> but when discord prevailed among them they were ruined; that the antient <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ritons,</HI> calling in the <HI>Saxons</HI> to assist them against their neighbours the <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> were

<P>A writer in the <HI>London Magazine, Iuly</HI> 1762, p. 377, treats this subject as follows:</P>
<P><Q>Attempts have been made to excite jealousy and ill will between one part of the nation and another. The northern part of the kingdom has been repre|sented as less worthy of the royal countenance and protection than the southern. People, whose dwel|ling is parted from ours only by a wall or a rivulet, are mentioned as a different species; and every one who happens to be born on the farther side, is stig|matized as being destitute of honesty and parts, inca|pable of public service, and unworthy of public confidence: but the same difference might with the
<PB N="334" REF="013851_1358_0F9E2CF010DFE2A0">
same reason be made between a native of <HI>Lancashire</HI> and one of <HI>Kent,</HI> as between a native of <HI>York</HI> and of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> And a man might with as much propriety reject the advice of a physician, because he lives in another parish, as a prince the service of an honest and able subject, because he was born in a particular county. It is indeed the characteristic of a wise and good prince to avail himself of integrity and parts wherever they happen to be found, without any re|gard to external circumstances, least of all to the par|ticular spot of his dominions where they were pro|duced. These who labour to spirit up intestine bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls and divisions, at a time when our utmost united strength is necessary to support us against the united force of foreign and intestine enemies, cannot surely be considered as the friends of their country; for it is impossible to give a stronger proof that their interest is not that of the public.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Eating oatmeal, scratching for the itch, lousiness, and beggary, are what an <HI>English</HI> porter would very readily apply to a <HI>Scotch</HI> nobleman of the most inde|pendent fortune. Even this hackneyed and vulgar abuse, which one would expect to hear only in gin|shops and alehouses, was for years the standing topic of wit and raillery in a political paper, professing to handle the most important concerns of the state; and the <HI>Scots</HI> had the good fortune to hear themselves re|proached every day for beggary.

excepting only that of coward. Why this impu|tation among innumerable others equally false and ridiculous, was always carefully avoided, I can only see one good reason, and that was, the writer's regard for his own personal safety.

<P>Lord <HI>Chatham</HI> shews a nobler way of thinking; who, in the debate on the Stamp-act, spoke as follows:
<Q>I have no local attachments. It is indifferent to me, whether a man was rocked in his cradle on this side of the <HI>Tweed,</HI> or on that. I sought for merit, wherever it was to be found. It is my boast that I was the first minister that looked for it; and I found it in the mountains of the north. I called it forth, and drew it into your service. A hardy race of men! men, who, when left by your jealousy, became a prey to the artifices of your enemies, and had gone nigh to overturn the state in the war before the last.

<P>The minds of the railers against our northern bre|thren are so narrow, that they can take in but half this little island. A generous spirit, according to our elegant poet, embraces all human kind.</P>
<P>Our times have, I suppose, exhibited the first in|stance of persons setting up for patriots upon the avow|ed principle of making one half of their country ene|mies to the other half. All patriots before those who published a series of writings intitled <HI>The North Bri|ton,</HI> which very title was intended to make <HI>North Britain</HI> odious to <HI>South Britain,</HI> have contented them|selves with making a tyrant, or his tools odious to the people; but never thought of teaching the people to hate the people.</P>
<P>This jealousy, industriously fomented by certain partisans, shews itself in various ways, and, among others, in an affectation of calling the <HI>British</HI> parlia|ment the <HI>English</HI> parliament, as was usual and proper before the union; but ridiculous, so long as the union subsists. This attachment to the terms <HI>England</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> in preference to <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>British,</HI> is pecu|liarly absurd in men, who profess themselves admi|rers of liberty; because we received the name of <HI>Eng|land</HI> from the <HI>Angles</HI> or <HI>Anglo-Saxons,</HI> who conquered us, in exchange for the name we were known by, when free, and before the <HI>Romans</HI> set foot on our island.</P>

<P>No wise and public-spirited citizen of this great and growing empire will think of disgracing any part of it; but, on the contrary, of improving all.

<P>This king expected parliament to support him against the <HI>Scotch</HI> army at <HI>Newcastle.</HI>
<Q>But it was the leading men of the party against the king that encouraged the <HI>Scotch</HI> army to enter <HI>England,</HI> and this party was so superior in parliament, that few of the king's friends durst open their mouths to support his interest. It was this <HI>Scotch</HI> invasion that compelled the king to call a parliament, and enabled the parliament to break all the king's measures, and oblige him to suffer a redress of grievances. In a word, it was solely by means of the <HI>Scots</HI> that the parliament had it in their power to restore the government to its antient and natural state. They (parliament) would have acted against their own interest, and directly contrary to the end they proposed, if they had supplied the king with means to drive the <HI>Scots</HI> out of the kingdom.

It is therefore unjust to blame them as if their whole motive for resisting the king had been the support of presby|terianism. They meant liberty as much as the <HI>English</HI> did.

They were restored at the restoration, to the great damage of the country. Under <HI>Charles</HI> II. the <HI>Scotch</HI> make overtures towards union. Difficulties were start|ed by lawyers, particularly that the constitution would be altered, and that it was treason to attempt altering the constitution by 8 <HI>Iac.</HI> VI. Thus the <HI>Scotch</HI> first moved this treaty, and first broke it off. Under <HI>Iames</HI> II. nothing was done. The times too busy, and too turbulent for union. <HI>William</HI> afterwards recommended it; but it could not be brought about

till Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s time. And now some patriots want to have it broken again. It was thought neces|sary to abolish the <HI>Scotch</HI> parliament, because two par|liaments would be always battling it, and the <HI>Scots</HI> would demolish the union whenever they pleased, and the intention was,
<Q>a lasting and incorporating union, that should put an an end to all <HI>distinctions</HI> and unite all interests.</Q>
Queen <HI>Anne</HI> was so earnest about it, that she went twice to the meeting of the commitee, to see how they went on, and to press the execution.

<P>I believe most impartial men have blamed the conduct of <HI>England</HI> in the affair of the <HI>Darien</HI> colony, and think we owe the <HI>Scots</HI> a good turn toward mak|ing up for our ill usage of them on that occasion, I do not say, the <HI>injury</HI> we did them, because I write with <HI>healing</HI> views.</P>
<P>The question was put concerning the <HI>Darien</HI> colony, in the house of peers, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1698. Several lords pro|tested against severe proceedings, because there was not time enough to judge of the merits of the cause. The house, however, addressed the king against it, because it was likely to be hurtful to the <HI>English</HI> plantation-trade, and to break the good correspondence between <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>England.</HI> [Therefore <HI>England</HI> was to do an unjust thing.] They acknowleged, that the case of the <HI>Scots</HI> was pitiable; for that they must be great losers by be|ing

disappointed of the advantage they proposed, and by the loss of the great sum they had laid out. They wish [kind souls!] that the <HI>Scots</HI> may desist, because they will only be greater losers in the end. They put the king in mind, that there had been a former address to him, which shewed the sense of the nation.

<P>Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> in her first speech,
<Q>had renewed the motion made by the late king, for the union of both kingdoms. Many of those who seemed now (<HI>A.

Yet it was carri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by a great majority, that the queen should be empowered to name commissioners for treating of an union. It was so visibly the interest of <HI>England,</HI> and of the present government, to shut the back door against the practices of <HI>France,</HI> and the attempts of the pretended prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> that the opposition made to this first step towards an union, and the indecent scorn, with which <HI>Seymour</HI> and others treated the <HI>Scots,</HI> were clear indications, that

<Q>Exclusive of other motives,</Q>
says the author of a LETTER TO LORD TEMPLE, p. 31, [for the union between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI>]
<Q>we see present ex|pedience, and the like causes interfere. And the event having taken place, all measures for producing that likeness and cordiality, which is the strongest political band, should be pursued by every honest man; and to this we are warmly admonished by the example of <HI>Rome,</HI> where the want of affection between the new and old citizens, threw the weight of the former into the scale of every corrupt party that arose in the state, and attached them not to their country, but to a <HI>Ma|rius,</HI> a <HI>Cinna,</HI> a <HI>Caesar.</HI></Q>
The same author goes on to shew, that irritating the people of <HI>North Britain</HI> tends to make them either unserviceable friends or resolved enemies. He shews how hurtful their hostility has been, and may be again to <HI>England,</HI> by joining with <HI>France.</HI> He then touches, but in a humane and gen|tleman-like manner, upon the national failings of our northern brethren, (we are not ourselves without fail|ings) who emerged into light, and knowledge, and liberal sentiment, later than <HI>England,</HI> and may there|fore be supposed a little backwarder in political know|ledge. <Q>As I write says he,
without any design of lowering that brave and prudent people in the estima|tion of their neighbours, and my strictures being on their government, not on individuals, I hope I shall stand acquitted in endeavouring to remove prejudices against any systems which may promote that assimila|tion with <HI>England,</HI> for which I have contended. Let <HI>Scotland</HI> discern, acknowledge, and imitate, where <HI>England</HI> is confessedly her superior. It derogates not from the merit of any single person to make the con|cession. For it is time, circumstances, and situation,
<PB N="364" REF="013851_1388_0F9E2C3AA3372300">
that have conferred the superiority. Let not <HI>England</HI> value herself too much upon this accidental superio|rity, nor despise her northern fellow-subjects for be|ing inferior as a people, whilst, as individuals, they are incontestibly their equals; and let them consider, that the less merit they allow the <HI>Scotch,</HI> the more it is to be expected, that they, as a brave and spirited nation, should insist on a <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 45.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>To this natural principle of resistance to injury, ought, in common candour, to be ascribed the proceed|ing of the people of <HI>North Britain,</HI> in sending up ad|dresses of a spirit and tendency contrary to those of the remonstrances presented by a vast multitude of the people of <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>North-Britons</HI> are farther from being slaves in their disposition, than any people in the world, if those of <HI>South Britain</HI> be excepted; but they saw, or thought they saw, a very unjustifiable spirit of national prejudice, acting in many of those concerned in the remonstrances; and they thought themselves obliged to oppose them on this very account. And this is the only public step they have taken on the occasion; while the scatterers of firebrands, arrows, and death, whose unpatriotic and diabolical labour has been to divide the united kingdom, by reviving the long<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">buried animosity between those whom nature and interest direct to cultivate peace and unanimity; have been but too much countenanced by many un|thinking and narrow-minded people on this side the <HI>Tweed.</HI> It must be confessed, that the late remon|strances were, to say the least, founded on a narrow bottom, and were in their tendency but frivolous.

It so happened, however, that the <HI>Scots</HI> were of the same mind with the <HI>English</HI> in this point. See

<P>On occasion of <HI>Porteous</HI>'s affair, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1737, it was thought necessary to send for the <HI>Scotch</HI> judges. A long debate arose in the house of peers, about the ho|nours
<PB N="366" REF="013851_1390_0F9E2C3C2E57B560">
to be shewn them in the house. One lord, not named <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB, LORDS, V.180.</NOTE> insists on their being received in the same manner as the <HI>English</HI> judges, and placed on the wool|sacks, &amp;c.
<Q>The <HI>Scots,</HI></Q>
says he, p. 182,
<Q>have a right to claim, that the same honours, the same re|spect, may be shewn by this house to the judges of <HI>Scotland</HI> as are shewn to the judges of <HI>England,</HI> ex|cepting only, that a preference is to be allowed to the latter with respect to their ranks or degrees.</Q>
And afterwards, p. 183,
<Q>This is the first time it has ever been thought necessary to ask the <HI>Scotch</HI> judges any questions; and if your lordships now oblige them to attend, I hope you will shew them the same honours, the same respect you would shew the judges of any of the courts of <HI>Westminster-hall,</HI> if they should be or|dered to attend for the like purpose.</Q>
And again, p. 184,
<Q>The right now in dispute before your lord|ships, is not the right of a private man, nor is it a right of a private nature; it is the right of a whole people, it is the right of a nation once free and inde|pendent; and it is a right stipulated by one of the most public and most solemn contracts that was ever made; a contract, which, on our parts, we are oblig|ed to observe and fulfil with the greatest nicety, be|cause the people of <HI>Scotland</HI> trusted entirely to our honour for a faithful performance; a submitting to be governed by one and the same parliament, in which they knew we would always have a great majority, was really, in effect, submitting every thing to our honour; and I hope, they shall never have the least occasion to repent of the confidence they have reposed in us. For this reason, in all cases where the rights or the privileges of the people of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by virtue of the
<PB N="367" REF="013851_1391_0F9E2C3CCF15DCB8">
articles of union, come to be questioned, I shall al|ways have a strong bias in their favour, especially when the matter in question relates to a piece of cere|mony. But in the present case I must think, there can be properly no question; for whether the judges of <HI>Scotland</HI> ought to be in this house as assistants to give their opinions upon such matters of law, as may arise in the course of our proceedings, in the same manner as the judges of <HI>England</HI> do, is a question, I think, determined not only by the articles of union, but by the very nature of the thing itself; because, while <HI>Scotland</HI> continues to be governed by laws dif|ferent from <HI>England,</HI> it will be impossible for us to do our duty without such assistance. My lords, as nothing contributed more than the union between the two kingdoms, towards the securing the protestant succession in the present illustrious family, so there is nothing can contribute more to the preservation of that succession, than the rendering that union every day more firm and unalterable; which can no way be done more effectually than by cementing the people by an union in hearts and affections, as well as an union established by law. While we have such a majority in both houses of parliament, the people of <HI>Scotland</HI> will always find it impossible to break through, or diss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lve the legal union which subsists between us; but if we should ever make use of that majority, which I hope we never shall, to break through, or encroach upon those articles, which have been stipulated between us, then the legal union will be of little force, it will only serve to make them desperate, and to run the risk even of their own perdition, in order to rid themselves of the yoke they groan under. They will be apt to ascribe to the present royal family all the ills they feel, or imagine
<PB N="368" REF="013851_1392_0F9E2C3E2E628EB8">
they feel; and if they should unanimously join in a contrary interest, we know they would be supported by a numerous party in this part of the island, as well as by a powerful party beyond seas; for which reason we ought to take all possible care, not to give them any just ground of complaint; we ought even to avoid a measure which may be made use of by the enemies of government for sowing discontent and disaffection in that part of the island.</Q>
And again, p. 186,
<Q>As I am not of that country, [<HI>Scotland,</HI>] I have spoken with the more freedom in this debate, because I think I cannot be suspected of prejudice or partiality. If I have any, I confess it is upon that side, on which I think my own honour, and the ho|nour of my country most deeply concerned, which I take to be in a most exact observance, not only of the words, but of the spirit and intention of the articles of union. We contracted together as nations quite independent of one another, and by the whole tenor of the contract it appears, that the subjects of both kingdoms are intitled to equal honours, privi|leges, and advantages. We have no pretence to any pre-eminence, but only that those of any rank in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> shall have precedence of those of the same rank in <HI>Scotland.</HI> This they have always, since the union, allowed us, and I hope we shall never dispute con|ferring upon any gentleman of rank in <HI>Scotland</HI> these marks of honour or respect, which are bestowed upon gentlemen of the same rank in <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> has remarked, that the hatred between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> subsists more on the part of the latter than the former.

<PB N="369" REF="013851_1393_0F9E2C3EA25BC6C0">
against strangers is indeed the only national dis|position we could wish altered in the <HI>English.</HI> It has sometimes happened that <HI>England</HI> has su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fered by this narrowness. As in the case of the rupture between the two nations, when <HI>Cromwell</HI> was made general against the <HI>Scots.</HI> Had the <HI>English</HI> treated their nor|thern brethren with the generosity they shew to one another, the war had never happened. A very short time before, there was the strictest amity possible be|tween the two kingdoms. But that being interrupted, by unjustifiable conduct on the side of the <HI>English,</HI> (see the historians of those times) and war between the two kingdoms following, General <HI>Fairfax</HI> declined the command, fairly declaring that he thought the war against <HI>Scotland</HI> unjust. On this <HI>Cromwell</HI> (whose conscience was not so rigid as <HI>Fairfax</HI>'s) was employ|ed. He was successful; gained honour; came into high power; and at last overset the glorious scheme of a republic, which, but for him, would probably have been established in this country.</P>
<P>But after all I have said with a view to suggest the necessity of correcting the narrowness of the <HI>English</HI> to strangers, and even to their northern brethren, let me add, That their <HI>incorporating</HI> the <HI>Scots,</HI> whom they had conquered at the battle of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and their giving them such advantageous terms at the union, notwithstanding their strong attachment at that time to what are called Tory principles, are proofs of great magnanimity in the people of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>To pretend that a native of <HI>North Britain</HI> has not a right to hold the place of secretary of state, or any other of the great offices, would be to assert, that there ought to be a peculiar mark of disgrace put upon the northern inhabitants of the united island, to place them in a worse condition than those of <HI>Ireland</HI> or the
<PB N="370" REF="013851_1394_0F9E2C3F8A59F6A0">
Colonies; in short, to make them Helotes, slaves, hewers of wood, and drawers of water. If there be any reason for this disadvantageous distinction, it ought to be produced.</P>
<P><Q>If the <HI>Scots</HI> had a spark of spirit or of love of their country left, if they were worthy of being admitted to the honour of an union with this great and illustri|ous nation, they ought, every man of them, to sub|mit their throats to the sword of the <HI>English,</HI> rather than suffer the oppression, the injustice, the indignity, the ingratitude of such a doctrine prevailing against them, that their country is held so infamous, so ac|cursed of God and man, that it is not entitled to the same chance with the <HI>English,</HI> of a promiscuous elec|tion of its natives to civil and military posts <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">LOND.

<P>This silly narrowness has, in all times, been a pre|judice and not an advantage. Time was when every little town insisted on monopolizing its own manufac|ture. <HI>Bridport,</HI> in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. petition|ed and (such was the ignorance of the legislature) ob|tained an act prohibiting the making of ropes any where out of <HI>Bridport</HI>; and the towns of <HI>Worcester, Eversham, Droitwich,</HI> &amp;c. the same for the woollen manufacture <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anders.</HI> HIST.

<P>Partiality for our own country, and contempt of others, arise from a disposition as thoroughly despica|ble as the same partiality in an individual in favour of himself. How much more magnanimous does the modesty of <HI>Horace</HI> appear, when he advises the <HI>Ro|man</HI> writers to study the <HI>Greek</HI> models, than if he had preferred those of his own country?

<Q>the <HI>Scotch</HI> commissioners at <HI>London</HI> presented memorials, containing reasons for de|posing their queen, and seconded their arguments with examples drawn from the <HI>Scotch</HI> history, the au|thority of laws, and the sentiments of the most fa|mous divines.

<P>If <HI>Iames</HI> I. and his son <HI>Charles</HI> I. and <HI>Iames</HI> II. had read <HI>Buchanan</HI>'s works, they might have lived and died in peace.

That if princes were republicans, subjects would be royal|ists; and that the more authority princes challange; the less free subjects will grant, and contrarywise.</P>
<P>What country has produced more strenous advo|cates for liberty than <HI>Buchanan</HI> and <HI>Fletcher?</HI> Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> was a very active promoter of the Revolution, as well as an able writer on the side of liberty. The late earl of <HI>Stair</HI> was turned out of all his employ|ments by <HI>Walpole,</HI> on account of his free principles. The great duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> was a constant champion in parliament against all the enslaving measures of his times. And in the year 1741,
<Q>the approaching session</Q>
(says <HI>Tindal</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">CONTIN. <HI>Rap.</HI> VIII.471.</NOTE>)
<Q>being the last of the parliament, great efforts were made to have one returned which should be against the minister. Though these endeavours were general all over the kingdom, where the oppo|sition had any interest, they were <HI>most</HI> prevalent in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where the duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> exerted himself with extraordinary vigour&mdash;and soon acquired in|fluence enough to procure a great majority of the <HI>Scotch</HI> representatives against the court at the next election.</Q></P>

<P>To conclude this head, you may depend upon it, my good countrymen, that neither railing against the <HI>Scots,</HI> nor even breaking the union, nor massacring the whole inhabitants of <HI>North Britain,</HI> (for who can tell how far our incendiaries wish to carry their ani|mosity) nor any popular cry against lord&mdash;or for Mr.&mdash;, nor any other party-object, is of consequence enough to be named in a day with the restoration of independency to parliament. They who are for this indispensible measure are undoubted friends to <HI>Eng|land</HI>; they who are against it, no matter what ban|ners they list under, they are more desirous of the emoluments of places and pensions, than studious of the good of their country. But to return;</P>
<P>It may be objected, that it will be difficult to find gentlemen properly qualified to send into parliament, when so many, must be new men every new parlia|ment. To this may be answered, That if the possibi|lity of bribing were taken away, which I have above shewn may be done, any man of common sense and common honesty may be a member; because his con|stituents may instruct him how to vote, and he will have no interest separate from that of his country, and the speaker, clerks, officers, &amp;c. who may be per|manent, will be masters of forms and the routine of business.</P>
<P>If it be said, the boroughs, which send in the majo|rity of the house, cannot be deprived of a <HI>right</HI> they have enjoyed by so long <HI>prescription</HI>; which must for
<PB N="378" REF="013851_1402_0F9E2C45E05C5128">
ever shut the door against all proposals of rendering parliamentary representation adequate; the answer is easy: The rotten boroughs obtained their right through the indirect views, or the caprice, of a set of crowned heads. General good is to be secured, though to the prejudice of unjust privilege. The more antient the grievance, the more is redress wanted. If this objec|tion be valid in this case, there can be no reformation, nor any new law or regulation made; for every new law brings prejudice to some individuals. See above, vol. 1. p. 62, <HI>et alibi.</HI></P>
<P>It is, and always has been, the cry of the defenders of present measures,
<Q>What would you have? Is not every person free to do what he pleases? Would you possess a greater degree of liberty than that which all enjoy at present?</Q>
But may not this be said in a country, and at a period when the <HI>constitution</HI> of that country is overturned? For that will always be the case, where the genius of the government, though absolute, is <HI>mild.</HI> I doubt not, but the partisans of <HI>Augustus</HI> lulled the <HI>Romans</HI> to submission with such discourses as these; for the individuals were as free at <HI>Rome</HI> the very next year after the bloody proscription was at an end, as in <HI>England</HI> now. But would a <HI>Brutus</HI> or a <HI>Cassius</HI> have let themselves be deceived by such means into a submission to <HI>Augustus?</HI> No. They would have rewarded him for violating the <HI>constitution</HI> as they did <HI>Iulius.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>inertia</HI> and timidity of the people are the great difficulties in the way of every reformation. It is not

This is well known to all tyrants in church and state; and their hope is that the people will not stir, till they be violently abused: and unfortunately it is then com|monly too late. For the tyrant and his tools must have a considerable confidence in their own strength, and the weakness of the cause of liberty, before they will venture on those violences; and then there is but little hope of procuring a revolution.</P>
<P><Q>Far from being ready to protect the rights of o|thers, every one must have seen his own many times flagrantly attacked, before he resolves to defend them; and it is difficult to conceive how great an advantage government takes from that want of spirit to oppose its criminal attempts, and how much it concerns public liberty, that subjects be not too patient.</Q></P>
<P><Q>When we peruse attentively the history of despo|tism, we sometimes behold with astonishment a hand|ful of men keeping a whole nation in awe. That inconsiderate moderation of the people, that timidity, that fatal propensity to separate their common inte|rests, are the true causes of this surprising phaenome|non.

That, as above observed, if there be now difficulties in the way, those difficulties will not be lessened by time, but increased and multiplied. As a presumptuous sinner, by putting of repentance, ren|ders his own restoration more and more difficult, so it

is with nations. Corruption and venality, if they be not rooted out, will increase more and more, and the power of the court will increase with them.</P>
<P>The principal difficulty in all such cases arises from the <HI>inertia</HI> of the people. Would all the independent people of <HI>England</HI> set themselves in earnest to begin and carry on the great work, what could prevent their success?</P>
<P>The excellent <HI>Sidney</HI> employs his whole 41st section in proving, that
<Q>the people, for whom, and by whom the magistrate is created, can only judge whether he rightly performs his office, or not.</Q>&mdash;
<Q>The people,</Q>
says he, p. 438,
<Q>cannot be deprived of their natural rights upon a frivolous pretence to that which never was, nor ever can be. They who create magistracies, and give to them such name, form, and power as they think fit, do only know, whether the end for which they were created be performed or not. They who give a being to the power which had none, can only judge whether it be employed to their welfare, or turned to their ruin. They do not set up one or a few men, that they and their posterity may live in splendour and greatness, but that justice may be ad|ministred, virtue established, and provision made for the public safety. No wise man will think this can be done, if those who set themselves to overthrow the law, are to be their own judges.</Q>
Again, p. 439,
<Q>It is as easy for the people to judge whether their governors, who have introduced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rruption, ought to be brought to order, and removed if they would not be reclaimed, or whether they should be suffered to ruin them and their posterity; as it is for me to judge whether I should put away my servant, if I knew he intended to poison or murder me, and had a certain facility of accomplishing his design; or
<PB N="381" REF="013851_1405_0F9E2C48254E8D68">
whether I should continue him in my service till he had performed it. Nay the matter is so much the more plain on the side of the nation as the dispropor|tion of merit between a whole people, and one or a few men intrusted with the power of governing them is greater than between a private man and his servant. This is so fully confirmed by the general consent of mankind, that we know no government that has not frequently either been altered in form, or reduced to its original purity, by changing the families or per|sons who abused the power with which they had been intrusted. Those who have wanted wisdom and vir|tue rightly and seasonably to perform this, have been soon destroyed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It has been the general unhappiness of countries, in which corruption has prevailed, that the bad men are bold and enterprising, forward and active; where|as such as keep their integrity, are unactive; cold and lazy; contented with the barren praise of not being guilty themselves, they suffer others to invade so much power, as that they can do hurt, and do it safely, and in a nation debauched in principles, many parts of the state may be filled by persons of high knowledge and virtue; but their love and zeal for the public, and their vigilance for its safety, their prudence, foresight, and caution, shall be all rendered ineffectual by the over-ruling madness of others.

<P>How can the people be too jealous of their liberties, when they know, that the best of kings and govern|ments, are, to say the least, more solicitous about their own power than about the people's liberties; that the best kings and governments are unwilling to give up the power they find within their reach, however un|justly acquired by their predecessors; so that the evil done by a tyrannical government is seldom effectually excluded by a good one, while the good done by a just government is often overset by a succeeding tyranny.</P>
<P>I have shewn you, my dear countrymen, that it is in vain to think of going on in the way we are in, with|out timely redress; that we have nothing before our eyes, but the diminution of our trade, and consequently of the national income, which must produce a defici|ency of that which ought to go to the payment of the dividends, after which may be expected to follow the despair and rage of thousands reduced to beggary, against those who shall be the supposed causes of this mis|chief; all which may lead on to insurrections of the people, to burning of houses, cutting of throats, and this horrible confusion may be expected to end, as those in <HI>Denmark</HI> did lately, in a general request to the reign|ing prince, to give the nation peace, by taking into his

The strength of the empire was not only decayed in numbers, but more in spirit; for slavery debases the minds of men: and it fares with nations as with pri|vate persons: both by oppression grow stupid and de|cline, even as low as the brutal part of the creation, unless they have spirit enough to relieve themselves.

<P><Q>Thus ended the greatest commonwealth, and at the same time began the greatest monarchy, that had ever been known, a monarchy which infinitely ex|celled in power, riches, extent, and continuance, all the monarchies and empires which had preceded it.

As to the yearly revenues of the empire, they have by a modest computation been reckoned to amount to forty millions of our money: but the <HI>Romans</HI> them|selves now ran head-long into all manner of luxury and effeminacy. The people were become a mere mob; those who were wont to direct mighty wars, to raise and depose great kings, to bestow or take away potent empires, were so sunk and debauched, that if they had but bread and shoes, their ambition went no higher. The nobility were indeed more polite than in former ages; but at the same time idle, venal, insensible of private virtue, utter strangers to public glory or disgrace, void of zeal for the welfare of their country and solely intent on gaining the favour of the emperor, as knowing that certain wealth and preferment were the rewards of ready sub|mission, acquiescence, and flattery.

<P><Q>These three tyrants, <HI>Antony, Lepidus,</HI> and <HI>Octavi|anus,</HI> went on adding daily to the number of the pro|scribed, till it amounted to 300 senators, and above 2000 knights. It is impossible to paint the horrors of this bloody proscription. By it every considerable man in <HI>Rome.</HI> who was disliked, or suspected by the triumvirate to disapprove their tyranny, who was rich, and had wherewithal to glut their avarice, was doomed to die. As it was death to conceal or help them, and ample rewards were given to such as discovered and killed them, many were betrayed and butchered by their slaves and freed men, many by their treacherous hosts and relations. Many fled to the wilderness, where they perished for want with their tender chil|dren. Nothing was to be seen but blood and slaugh|ter; the streets were covered with dead bodies; the heads of the most illustrious senators were exposed
<PB N="389" REF="013851_1413_0F9E2C4F92E710C8">
upon the rostra, and their bodies left unburied in the streets and fields, to be devoured by the dogs and ra|venous birds. This looked like dooming <HI>Rome</HI> to perish at once. Many uncondemned persons perished in this confusion; some by malice or mistake, others for concealing or defending their friends. Several of the antient historians seem to take pleasure in describ|ing the horrors of this bloody and cruel proscription, which reduced the populous capital of the world al|most to a wilderness. They produce many remark|able and moving instances of the affection of wives for their husbands, and of the fidelity of slaves to|wards their masters; but few, very few, as they own with great concern, of the love of children towards their parents. However, the dutiful behaviour of <HI>Oppius</HI> may stand for many, who, like <HI>Eneas,</HI> carried his old and decrepid father on his shoulders to the sea-side, and escaped with him into <HI>Sicily.</HI> His piety was not long unrewarded; for on his return to <HI>Rome,</HI> after the triumvirs had put an end to the proscrip|tion, he found the people so taken with that generous action, that all the tribes unanimously concurred in raising him to the aedilship; and because he wanted money to exhibit the usual sports, the artificers worked without wages; and the people not only taxed themselves to defray the necessary charges at|tending such shows, but gave proofs of the esteem they had for so dutiful a son, by such contributions as amounted to twice the value of his paternal estate, which had been confiscated by the triumvirs. <HI>Caius Hosidius Geta</HI> was likewise saved by his son, who spread a report, that his father had laid violent hands on himself, and to render the fact more credible, spent the poor remains of his fortune in performing his obsequies. By this means <HI>Hosidius,</HI> not being
<PB N="390" REF="013851_1414_0F9E2C50546033A8">
searched after, made his escape, but lost one of his eyes, which he had kept too long covered with a pla|ster, the better to disguise him. As for the barba|rous impiety of those children, who by a strange apostasy from nature betrayed their own parents, it ought to be buried in oblivion. Nothing can reflect greater infamy on the memory of the triumvirs, than their countenancing such impious monsters. Several slaves chose rather to die on the rack, amidst the most exquisite torments, than discover the place where their masters lay concealed; others, not caring to outlive them, fell by their own hands upon their dead bodies. Many illustrious matrons gave remarkable proofs of their conjugal love in those times of cala|mity, which ought not to be passed over in silence. The wife of <HI>Q. Ligarius,</HI> seeing her husband betrayed by one of his slaves, declared to the executioners, who cut of his head, that she had concealed him, and consequently ought, in virtue of the decree, to undergo the same fate. But they not hearkening to her, she appeared before the triumvirs themselves, upbraided them with their cruelty, owned she had concealed, in spite of their decree, her husband, and begged death of them as a favour. Being driven away by their officers, she shut herself up in her own house, and there, as she was determined not long to outlive her husband, starved herself to death. <HI>Acilius</HI> was betrayed by one of his slaves, and apprehended, but redeemed by his wife who readily parted with all her jewels to save his life. <HI>Apuleius Antistius Antius, Q. Lucretius Vispallis, Titus Vinnius,</HI> and many others, were saved by the ingenious contrivances of their wives, after they had given themselves up for lost. <HI>Lucius,</HI> the uncle of <HI>Antony,</HI> was saved by his sister <HI>Iulia,</HI> in whose house he had taken refuge.
<PB N="391" REF="013851_1415_0F9E2C51128B4C98">
Though the country, as well as the city, swarmed with informers and assassins, yet many illustrious citi|zens found means to avoid the fury of the proscrip|tion, and to get safe, either to <HI>Brutus</HI> in <HI>Macedon,</HI> or to <HI>Sextus Pompeius</HI> in <HI>Sicily.</HI> The latter kept constantly a great number of small vessels hovering on the coasts of <HI>Italy,</HI> to receive such as made their escape, and treated them with great kindness and civility. As to <HI>Cicero,</HI> he had not the good luck to escape, but fell a sacrifice to the implacable rage of <HI>Antony.</HI> The great reputation of that orator, the obligations which all men of learning owe to his memory, and the inimi|table works he has left behind him, require of us a particular account of his death, and the most minute circumstances attending it. He was with his brother <HI>Quintus,</HI> who was likewise proscribed, at his country house near <HI>Tusculum,</HI> when the first news were brought him of the proscription, which he no sooner heard, than he left <HI>Tusculum</HI> with his brother, taking his route towards <HI>Austura,</HI> or as some call it, <HI>Stura,</HI> another of his country-houses on the sea side, between the promontories of <HI>Antium</HI> and <HI>Circoeum.</HI> There they both designed to take shipping, and endeavour to join <HI>Brutus</HI> in <HI>Macedon.</HI> They travelled together each in his litter, oppressed with sorrow, and often joining their litters on the road to condole each other. As they had in the first alarm and hurry forgot to take with them the necessary money to defray the ex|pences of their voyage, it was agreed between them, that <HI>Cicero</HI> should make what haste he could to the sea side, and <HI>Quintus</HI> return home to provide neces|saries. Then they embraced each other, and parted with reciprocal fear. <HI>Quintus</HI> returned to <HI>Rome,</HI> and got to his house undiscovered, where he thought him|self safe, at least for a short time, since it had been
<PB N="392" REF="013851_1416_0F9E2C51F10E0F48">
lately searched by the ministers of the triumvirs. But as in most houses there were as many informers as domestics, his return was immediately known, and the house of course was filled with soldiers and assas|sins, who not being able to find him out, put his son to the torture, in order to make him declare where his father lay concealed. But filial affection was proof in the young <HI>Roman</HI> against the most ex|quisite torments. However, the tender youth could not help sighing now and then, and groaning in the height of his pain. <HI>Quintus</HI> was not far of; and the reader may imagine, though we cannot express, how the heart of a tender father must have been af|fected in hearing the sighs and groans of a son dying on the rack to save his life. He could not bear it; but quitting the place of his concealment, he pre|sented himself to the assassins, begging them with a flood of tears to put him to death, and dismiss the innocent child, whose generous behaviour the trium|virs themselves, if informed of the fact, would judge worthy of the highest encomiums and rewards. But those inhuman monsters, without being in the least affected with the tears either of the father or the son, answered, that they must both die, the father because he was proscribed, and the son, because, in defiance of the decree of the triumvirs he had concealed his father. Then a new contest of tenderness arose between the father and the son who should die first: but this the assassins, destitute of all sense of humanity, and no way affected with such melting scenes, soon decided, by beheading them both at the same time. Though <HI>Quintus Cicero</HI>'s wife was not perhaps without re|proach, his death, it must be owned, was truly glo|rious: as for that of his son, it has been, and ever will be, celebrated by the writers of all nations and
<PB N="393" REF="013851_1417_0F9E2C528D0ADA18">
ages as an instance of the most heroic affection, and filial duty. But to return to the elder brother, <HI>Cicero</HI> having reached <HI>Austura,</HI> and by good luck found a vessel there ready to weigh anchor, went on board with a design to pass over into <HI>Macedon,</HI> and join <HI>Brutus.</HI> But either dreading the inconveniencies of such a voyage, or still depending on the friendship of <HI>Octavianus,</HI> whom he had all along supported with his credit and eloquence, he soon changed his mind, and ordered the master of the ship to set him ashore at <HI>Circaeum,</HI> whence he took his route towards <HI>Rome</HI> by land. But after he had gone about two hundred furlongs he altered his resolution anew, and returned to sea, where he spent the night in a thousand melancholy and perplexing thoughts. One while he resolved to go privately into <HI>Octavianus</HI>'s house, and there kill himself upon the altar of his domestic gods, in order to bring upon him the wrath of those furies who were deemed the avengers of violated friendship. But the fear of being taken on the road, and the appre|hension of the cruel treatment he expected, if taken, soon made him drop that resolution. Then falling into other thoughts equally perplexing, and wavering between the hopes he had in <HI>Octavianus</HI>'s friend|ship and the fear of death, he at last suffered his do|mestics to convey him by sea to a country-house, which he had in the neigbourhood of <HI>Caieta</HI>; where he had not been long, when his domestics carried him again in a litter towards the sea-side. They were scarce gone, when a band of soldiers under the com|mand of <HI>Herennius</HI> a centurion, and <HI>Popilius Laenas</HI> a military tribune, came to the house. <HI>Cicero</HI> had formerly undertaken the defence of <HI>Popilius,</HI> when he was under a prosecution for the murder of his own father, and by his triumphing eloquence, had
<PB N="394" REF="013851_1418_0F9E2C550FF459C0">
got him absolved by those very judges, who a little before were ready to condemn him to a most cruel death. But the ungrateful wretch, unmindful of farmer obligations, and wholly intent on currying fav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur with <HI>Antony,</HI> had promised to find out <HI>Cicero,</HI> wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver he lay concealed, and bring him his head. He found the doors of his house shut, but breaking them open, and searching in vain every corner, he threatened to put all the slaves in the house to the torture, if they did not immediatly declare where their master lay concealed. But the faithful slaves, without be|traying the least fear, answered with great constancy and resolution, that they knew not where he was. At length a young man, by name <HI>Philologus,</HI> who had been slave to <HI>Quintus,</HI> and afterwards enfranchised by him, and instructed by <HI>Cicero</HI> in the liberal arts and sciences, with all the tenderness of a father, disco|vered to the tribune, that <HI>Cicero</HI>'s domestics were then carrying him in a litter through the close and shady walks to the sea side. Upon this information <HI>Popilius,</HI> with some of his men, hastened to the place where he was to come out, while <HI>Herennius</HI> with the rest followed the litter through the narrow paths. As soon as <HI>Cicero</HI> perceived <HI>Herennius,</HI> he commanded his servants to set down his litter, and stroking, ac|cording to his custom, his head with his left hand, he put out his head, and looked at the assassins with great intrepidity. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> constancy, which they did not expect from him, his face disfigured and emacia|ted with cares and troubles, his hair and beard ne|glected, and in disorder, &amp;c. so affected the soldiers who attended <HI>Herennius,</HI> that they covered their eyes with their hands, while he cut of his head, and pur|suant to <HI>Antony</HI>'s directions his right hand, with which he had written the <HI>Philippics.</HI> With those tro|phies
<PB N="395" REF="013851_1419_0F9E2C5622E987D0">
of their cruelty, <HI>Herennius</HI> and <HI>Popilius</HI> hastened back to <HI>Rome,</HI> and laid them before <HI>Antony,</HI> while he was holding an assembly of the people for the election of new magistrates. The cruel tyrant no sooner beheld them, than he cried out in a transport of joy, Now let there be an end of all proscriptions: live, <HI>Romans,</HI> live in safety; you have nothing more to fear. He took the head in his hand, and looked on it a long time with great satisfaction, smiling at a sight, which drew tears from all who were present. After he had satiated his cruel and revengful temper with so dismal a spectacle, he sent, as we are told by several writers, the head of the orator to his wife. <HI>Fulvia</HI> was naturally more cruel than the trium|vir himself, and had born an implacable hatred to <HI>Cicero,</HI> ever since the time of her first husband <HI>P. Clo|dius</HI> who was slain by <HI>Milo.</HI> That fury, after hav|ing insulted the poor remains of her enemy with the most injurious reproaches, took that venerable head in her lap, and drawing out the tongue of the de|ceased which had uttered many bitter invectives against both her husbands, pierced it several times with a golden bodkin which she wore in her hair. When <HI>Fulvia</HI> had satiated her impotent rage, <HI>Antony</HI> ordered both the head and the hand to be set up on the ro|stra, where <HI>Rome</HI> could not without horror behold the remains of a man who had so often triumphed in that very place, by the force and charms of his eloquence. Thus fell the greatest orator which <HI>Italy,</HI> or any other country, ever bred; a man, who, as <HI>Caesar</HI> the dic|tator used to say, had obtained a laurel as much above all triumphs, as it was more glorious to extend the bounds of the <HI>Roman</HI> learning than those of the <HI>Ro|man</HI> empire. In his consulate, which was truly glorious, he discovered with wonderful sagacity the
<PB N="396" REF="013851_1420_0F9E2C570FF24E50">
most secret plots of the seditious <HI>Cataline,</HI> defeated his best concerted measures, and saved, we may say, <HI>Rome</HI> from utter destruction; whence he was deser|vedly honoured with the glorious t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tle of the father of his country. The <HI>Roman</HI> people no doubt owed him much, and he took care <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o put them frequently in mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of their obligations; for he was quoting on all occasions, in and out of season, the nones of <HI>De|cember,</HI> as <HI>M. Brutus</HI> observed in one of his letters to <HI>Atticus.</HI> He loved his country; but his zeal did not carry him so far as to make him sacrifice his pri|vate interest to the public welfare. But after all, the intrepidity with which he offered himself to death, ought to make us in a manner overlook the timo|rousness, pusillanimity, and irresolution, which he betrayed in most occurrences of his life. He died on the seventh of the ides of <HI>December,</HI> in the sixty-fourth year of his age, and was greatly lamented by all ranks of men. <HI>Antony</HI> himself made some sort of reparation to his memory; for, instead of rewarding the perfi|dious <HI>Philo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ogus,</HI> who betrayed his master and bene|factor, he delivered him up to <HI>Pompona,</HI> the widow of <HI>Quintus Cicero,</HI> and sister of <HI>Pomponius Atticus,</HI> who after having glut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed her impotent rage, and desire of revenge with the most exquisite torments cruelty it|self could invent, obliged the miserable captive to cut off his own flesh by peace-meal, boil it, and eat it in her presence. But <HI>Tiro Cicero</HI>'s freeman has not so much as mentioned the treachery of <HI>Philologus,</HI> as we have observed above out of <HI>Plutarch.

<P>Such are the miseries, which the <HI>Romans</HI> brought upon themselves by not securing their liberties in time.

<P>Martial law was the most horrible of all tyranny.

<Q>as should be thought by their discretions most necessary.</Q>
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> ordered the importation of bulls, indulgences, or even prohibited books, to be punished with martial law; and rioters and va|grants to be hanged upon the spot where taken; so that almost any body might hang any body, any how, or any where <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 719.</NOTE>. Imprisonment in those days was arbitrary at the pleasure of the privy council, or se|cretary of state, and the torture might be used upon the secretary of state's warrant: so that the government of <HI>England</HI> was, in the days of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. <HI>Mary, Eliza|beth,</HI> and <HI>Iames</HI> I. upon much the same arbitrary principles as that of <HI>Turkey</HI> is now. The crown had every power but that of laying on taxes; and the sub|ject was not the less oppressed for the court's not hav|ing that power. <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s arbitrary proceedings made up for this. She gave patents and monopolies,
<PB N="402" REF="013851_1426_0F9E2C5C1CD47E40">
she extorted loans, she forced the people to buy off expensive offices, she demanded benevolences, she increased arbitrarily the duties upon goods, she oblig|ed the sea port towns to find a certain number of ships, and the counties a certain quota of men, clothed, armed, and sent to the place of their desti|nation; she laid arbitrary embargoes upon merchan|dise, she demanded new-years gifts, she victualled her navy by purveyance, that is, her officers seised whatever they could of provisions, and paid what price they pleased; the crown enjoyed all rents during the minority of heirs and heiresses. The good lord <HI>Bur|leigh</HI> proposed to the queen an inquisitorial court for correcting all abuses, which court should profit her revenue more than her father's demolition of the mo|nasteries did him, which court should proceed accord|ing to law, and to
<Q>her absolute power, from whence law proceeded <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hume,</HI> HIST. TUD. II.722.</NOTE>.</Q>
All these proceedings were unwar|ranted by authority of parliament; and the legislative authority of parliament was of no avail, because it might at any time be set aside by the dispensing power of the crown, and the royal proclamations had the force of laws. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> went so far as to prohibit the cultivation of woad, a very useful dyeing material, because she was possessed with a whim against the smell of that plant. She sent about her officers to break every sword, and trim every ruff they found, that were larger than she allowed, in the same man|ner as the Czar <HI>Peter</HI> ordered his men to shave by force, and with a blunt razor, all the old-fashioned beards they met <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. <HI>Penry</HI> was hanged for some pa|pers found in his pocket, which allowed the queen's absolute power, but did not assert it quite so strongly

as the court desired. Yet all this tremendous power did not prevent shocking misrule among the people; for severe punishment hardens, instead of making subjects obedient. Two or three hundred criminals, or pretended criminals, were to be tried at the assizes in single counties, and innumerable multitudes of vaga|bonds and ruffians filled the whole nation with ra|pine, terror, and confusion.

<P>On the contrary, the advantage of liberty appears in a very striking light in the following narration:</P>
<P><Q>In the year 1708 happened an accident, the more disagreeable to the <HI>Russians,</HI> as <HI>Peter</HI> was at that time unpro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">perous in war. <HI>Matueof,</HI> his ambassador to the court of <HI>London,</HI> having obtained an audience of leave of queen <HI>Anne,</HI> was arrested for debt in the public street by two bailiffs, at the suit of some tradesmen, and obl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ged to give in bail. The plaintiffs asserted, that the laws of commerce were of a superior nature to the privileges of ambassadors; on the other hand, <HI>Matueof,</HI> and all the other foreign ministers who espoused his cause, maintained that their persons ought to be sacred <HI>Peter,</HI> by his letters to queen <HI>Anne,</HI> strongly insisted up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n satisfaction; but she could not comply with his desire, because, by the laws of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> the creditors had a right to sue for their just demands, and there was no law to exempt foreign ministers from being arrested for debt. The murder of <HI>Patkul,</HI> the Czar's ambassador, who had been execut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the preceeding year, by order of <HI>Charles</HI> XII. w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in some measure an encouragement to the people of <HI>England</HI> not to respect a character so grossly abused&punc; The other foreign ministers residing then in <HI>London</HI> were obliged to be bound for <HI>Matueof,</HI> and all that the queen could do in favour of the Czar, was to prevail on the parliament to pass an act whereby it was no longer lawful to arrest an ambassador for debt. But after the battle of <HI>Pultowa,</HI> it became necessary
<PB N="405" REF="013851_1429_0F9E2C5F8DB46858">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o give a more public satisfaction to that prince. The queen, by a formal embassy, made an excuse for what had passed. Mr. <HI>Whitworth,</HI> who was pitched upon for this ceremony, opened his speech with the following words, Most high and most mighty Emperor. He told the Czar that the queen had imprisoned the persons who had presumed to arrest his ambassador, and that the delinquents had been rendered infamous. This was not true; but the ac|knowledgment was sufficient; and the title of Em|peror, which the queen had not given him before the battle of <HI>Pultowa,</HI> plainly shewed the degree of esti|mation to which he was now raised in <HI>Europe.</HI> This title had been already granted him in <HI>Holland,</HI> not only by those who had been his fellow-workmen in the dock <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at <HI>Sardam,</HI> and seemed to interest themselves most in his glory, but even by the chief persons in the state, who unanimously stiled him Em|peror, and celebrated his victory with rejoicings in the presence of the <HI>Swedish</HI> minister. The Czar (says the preface to lord <HI>Whitworth</HI>'s account of <HI>Rus|sia</HI>) who had been absolute enough to civilize savages, had no idea, could conceive none, of the privileges of a nation civilized in the only rational manner by laws and liberties. He demanded immediate and se|vere punishment on the offenders; he demanded it of a princess, whom he thought interested to assert the sacredness of the persons of monarchs even in their representatives; and he demanded it with threats of wrecking his vengeance on all <HI>English</HI> merchants, and subjects established in his dominions. In this light the menace was formidable; otherwise happily the rights of a whole people were more sacred here than the persons of foreign ministers. The Czar's memo|rials urged the queen with the satisfaction which she
<PB N="406" REF="013851_1430_0F9E2C610048C4E8">
herself had extorted, when only the boat and servants of the earl of <HI>Manchester</HI> had been insulted at <HI>Venice.</HI> That state had broken through their fundamental laws, to content the queen of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> How noble a picture of government, when a monarch that can force another nation to infringe its constitution, dare not violate his own. One may imagine with what difficulty our secretaries of state must have la|boured through all the ambages of phrase in <HI>English, French, German,</HI> and <HI>Russian,</HI> to explain to <HI>Muscovite</HI> ears and <HI>Muscovite</HI> understandings, the meaning of indictments, pleadings, precedents, juries, and ver|dicts; and how impatiently <HI>Peter</HI> must have listened to promises of a hearing next term? With what asto|nishment must he have beheld a great queen engaging to endeavour to prevail on her parliament to pass an act to prevent any such outrage for the future? What honour does it not reflect on the memory of that princess to own to an arbitrary emperor, that even to appease him she dared not to put the meanest of her subjects to death uncondemned by law. There are says she, in one of her dispatches to him, insuperable difficulties with respect to the antient and fundamen|tal laws of the government of our people, which, we fear, do not permit so severe and rigorous a sentence to be given as your imperial majesty at first seemed to expect in this case. And we persuade ourself that your imperial majesty, who are a prince famous for clemency and exact justice, will not require us, who are the guardian and protectress of the laws to inflict a punishment upon our subjects, which the law does not empower us to do. Words so venerable and heroic, that this broil ought to become history, and be exempted from the oblivion due to the silly squab|bles of ambassadors and their privileges. If <HI>Anne</HI> de|served

<P>That the states of <HI>Holland</HI> are what they are in con|sequence of their being free, appears by the follow|ing:</P>
<P>The duke of <HI>Parma</HI> succeeding to the government of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> upon the death of <HI>Don Iohn</HI> of, <HI>Austria,</HI> he began his government with the taking of the strong town of <HI>Mastrecht</HI> from the States, and next by his reducing the <HI>Walloon</HI> provinces of <HI>Artois H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inault,</HI> and <HI>Walloon-Flanders,</HI> by capitulation to the dominion of <HI>Spain.</HI> Hereupon, and for other r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">sons, the prince of <HI>Orange</HI> duly considering the emulation amongst the great men, as well as that the difference of religion in the several provinces could h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rdly ever be reconciled; and being at the same time desirous to secure himself, and to establish, as far as possible, the protestant religion, he procured the states of <HI>Guelderland, Holland, Zealand, Friesland,</HI> and <HI>Ut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">echt,</HI> to meet at the last-named city in this year, 1579; when they mutually and solemnly stipulated to defend one another as one joint body, and with united consent to advise of peace, war, taxes, &amp;c. and also to support liberty of conscience, And to complete the present number of seven pro|vinces now of the united <HI>Netherlands, Overyssel,</HI> and <HI>Groninge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> were soon after admitted into the union; an union which, in a few years, formed the most potent republic which the world had seen since that of old <HI>Rome</HI>; and of the greatest commerce and mari|time
<PB N="408" REF="013851_1432_0F9E2C6250B5CD30">
power that (as a republic) ever was on earth. For, that so small a state should between this year 1579 and 1600, not only preserve its independency against the then mightiest potentate in <HI>Europe,</HI> but likewise get footing in <HI>Flanders,</HI> by mastering the strong and important towns of <HI>Sluyce</HI> and <HI>Hulst,</HI> &amp;c. to ruin the trade of the most famous city of <HI>Antwerp</HI>; to conquer the strong forts of <HI>Bergen-op-zoom, Breda,</HI> and sundry other places on the <HI>Mease</HI> and <HI>Rhine,</HI> &amp;c. also to attack and annoy so great a mo|narch in his own ports at home; and maugre all the vast expence of such great exploits, to grow rich and opulent as well as potent, will, perhaps, scarcely obtain an historical credit in another century; but with us it serves only to shew the immense effects of an universally extended commerce, an indefatigable industry, joined to an unparalleled parsimony and oeconomy. Soon after this famous period, the indus|trious and parsimonious traders of these united pro|vinces pushed into a considerable share of that com|merce to several parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> which, till then, <HI>England</HI> had solely enjoyed.

But when the seven provinces had united, and began to defend themselves with success under the conduct of the prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the countenance of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and when the persecution began to grow sharp on account of religion in the <HI>Spanish Netherland</HI> pro|vinces, all the professors of the reformed religion, and haters of the <HI>Spanish</HI> dominion, retired into the strong cities of this new commonwealth, and gave the same date to the growth of trade there, and the decay of it at <HI>Antwerp.</HI> It would be too tedious to instance all the other causes of the said vast increase of the wealth and power of the united <HI>Netherlands</HI> in those early times, and afterwards: Such as, 1st, the long civil wars first in <HI>France,</HI> next in <HI>Germany,</HI> and lastly in <HI>England</HI>; which drove thither all that were

lived in great splendor and affluence. Now they are poor, and their number diminished. Their estates will scarce pay the taxes. They are necessitated to grind their poor tenants. They often give up an estate to the king, rather than pay the taxes laid upon it. Sometimes the king will not have them; the tax is better; the best parts being obliged to make up the deficiencies which the worst cannot. Very different from their condition, when they voluntarily contri|buted to the public expence according to their abili|ties. They now retire into obscure and cheap places, unless when they can obtain court-places, of which there are but few, and of small value. And many of them are given to foreigners, rather than natives; as the court thinks it can better depend on those, whose fortunes it has raised, than in those whom it has ruined. This policy likewise served the purpose of a ministry, who wanted to break the spirit of the nobles. Therefore they give the court-employments chiefly to the meanest of the nobility, as the fittest instruments for executing their tyrannical schemes. And when such persons grew rich by extortion upon the people, and clamours began to rise, they stripped them of their ill-gotten wealth, reduced them to their former condition, and increased the revenue by the bargain, giving themselves an air of patriotism in plundering the people by proxy. So the leviathans of power deceive and rob the subjects in almost all countries. The consequence of this oppression is, that the people of <HI>Denmark,</HI> finding it impossible to secure property, squander away their little gettings, as fast as they gain them, and are irremediably poor. Oppres|sion and arbitrary sway beget distrust and doubts about the security of property; doubts beget profusion, men chusing to squander on their pleasures what they

When they go to redressing, they generally do great mischief, before they begin re|dressing. But this is the fault of those who resist them. They are generally in the right, as was the case at <HI>Florence,</HI> in the 14th century <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">MOD. UNIV. HIST. XXXVI.149.</NOTE>. The tyranny of the eighth field deputies was intolerable, and the people were right in demanding the abolition of it; all that was wrong was the magistrates refusing the people re|dress, and the people's redressing themselves, in too violent a mannner. Commotions of this kind, with all their terrible consequences, are almost always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wing to the unreasonable difference made between princes, or nobles, and the people, by prerogative or pri|vilege. The people may be brought, by inveterate tyranny, to bear patiently to see the most worthless part of mankind (for surely the great by mere birth, in all ages and countries, are commonly among the most worthless of mankind) set up above them, and them|selves obliged to crouch. But sometimes the people grow uneasy under this. And if the people rouse to vengeance, woe to those who stand in their way. Let merit only be honoured with privilege and prerogative, and mankind will be contented. The wise antients understood this, and therefore were very cautious of making differences. A crown of grass, or a couple of twigs, was the reward of the most heroic actions.

This indeed was the very design of the ostracism, viz. to prevent unreasonable inequali|ties, and the desire of power and pre-eminence, which always produces disturbance.</P>
<P>Nothing is much more formidable, than a popular insurrection. When 60,000 men in the time of <HI>Richard</HI> II. assembled, and demanded redress of griev|ances, they made the king and nobles tremble. The government was glad to quiet them by any means; and granted them charters after charters <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Braay,</HI> III.346.</NOTE>. There were many lives lost, and much mischief done on that occasion. All wise governments will carefully avoid irritating the people beyond measure. And all sound patriots will avoid rousing the people, if redress can be any other way obtained. Therefore I do not propose having recourse to force. What I propose is, to apply the power of the people, guided, limited, and directed by men of property, who are interested in the security of their country, and have no income, by place or pension, to indemnify them for bring|ing slavery and ruin upon their country&mdash;to ap|ply this power (if found absolutely necessary) to prevent the application of the same power unre|strained unlimited, and directed by mere caprice, or the spirit of party. Perhaps, when things come to a crisis, which most probably they will soon, our government may recollect themselves so far as to grant voluntarily, and with a good grace, that redress, to which the people have an undoubted right, and which they see the people resolute to have. I will, there|fore, attempt to draw the sketch of such a plan for
<PB N="427" REF="013851_1451_0F9E2C75D708AAE0">
retrieving the nation, and restoring the constitution, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> me seems the most promising.

<P>But I need not have recourse to a mountain for a pulpit, nor to the angel's trumpet to swell my voice. If the still small voice of reason will not move you, all the terrors of mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> or of the day of judgment, will not produce the proper effect.</P>
<P>In the mean time, for our encouragement, that the spirit of liberty is not totally extinct in the people, we observe that some of the constituents have required their candidates to promise solemnly, that if elected, they would promote certain reformations, and the correction of various gross abuses.</P>
<P>It were to be wished that those who first drew up the terms of the engagements, had not overloaded their demands; but that they had confined themselves to one only article. I mean the endeavouring to get an inde|pendent parliament. An independent parliament would at all times secure the rights of the people, as has been shewn in the foregoing volumes. A candidate's re|fusing to promise his best endeavours in the house, if elected, for obtaining independent parliaments, would be an open declaration, that, in aspiring to a seat, his object was not the service of his country, but the gra|tifying his own ambitious or avaricious private views.</P>

And yet in several parts of his work he magnifies the peril, from the army, as if a tyrannical prince or ministry could at any time, by its means, seize our liberties at their pleasure. If this be true, how can this writer pretend to talk of our extricating ourselves? If this be true, the point is decided, the case is desperate, our liberties are gone; we have no|thing left, but to bear patiently what we have brought upon ourselves? But do not you, my good country|men, suffer yourselves to be duped by such quibbles as these. I have not absolutely pronounced upon the-state of our liberties.

<P>Before all other things, there must be established a GRAND NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR RESTORING

But instead of uniting for their common interest, the people have suffered themselves to be divided and split into fac|tions and parties to such a degree, that every man hath rose up in enmity against his neighbour; by which they have brought themselves under the fatal curse of a kingdom divided against itself, which can|not stand <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">HIST.

<P>By the readiness of the people to enter into the asso|ciations, it may be effectually determined, whether the majority are desirous of the proposed reformations. This, as has been observed before, is a matter of supreme consequence, for resistance to government, unless it be by a clear majority of the people, is rebel|lion. Therefore, with all due submission to the judg|ment of Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> upon that point, the true cri|terion between rebellion and reformation consists not

in the atrociousness of the abuses to be reformed, but in the concurrence of the people in desiring reforma|tion. For wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever the majority desire, it is certainly lawful for them to have, unless they desire what is contrary to the laws of God.</P>
<P>Confederacies and associations have been usual in all countries, especially in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>A confederacy of the nobility of <HI>France</HI> was formed against that weak and worthless prince <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. in which 500 were concerned; and their places of ren|dezvous were the most public, as the church of <HI>Notre Dame.</HI> At last they assembled an army of 100,000 men.

<P>A grand national association against popery was pro|posed in the house of commons, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1680. A ty|rannical government is an association with a vengeance. Why should not the people associate against it? Re|solved, that it is the opinion of this house, that the house be moved that a bill be brought for an associa|tion of all his majesty's protestant subjects for the safety of his majesty's person, the defence of the protestant religion, and for preventing the duke of <HI>York,</HI> or any other papist, from succeeding to the crown <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">DEB.

<P>See the act for associating the kingdom in defence of king <HI>William</HI> III. <HI>A. D,</HI> 1696<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">STAT. AT LARG, III.236.</NOTE>. The court was glad to encourage such an association of the people in a time of danger. They did not then insist, as has been done since, that the people are annihilated, or absorbed into the parliament; that the voice of the people is no where to be heard but in parliament; that members of parliament are not responsible to their constituents, &amp;c. The association was begun by the people, and parliament gave it sanction afterwards. Surely it is as necessary to associate for preserving the kingdom, as it was then for preserving the king.

How glorious would the character of <HI>Augustus</HI> have appeared to all posterity, had he really intended what he only affected to intend; I mean the restoration of the republican government upon the fall of <HI>Iulius,</HI> which he certainly had power to bring about, notwithstanding his pretences to the con|trary? In the same manner, would not every worthy <HI>British</HI> bosom glow with affection, would not every angel in heaven tune his lyre to the praises of that mo|narch, who, shaking off and trampling under his feet the ministerial trammels, should dare to think for himself, and to speak for himself, should astonish both houses of parliament, and all <HI>Europe,</HI> by opening a new parliament, or a new session, with a speech composed by himself, in which he should condemn the long prevalence of corrup|tion in the legislative assemblies, and should earnestly re|commend to them the making and bringing in effectual bills for restoring annual parliaments, for making repre|sentation adequate, for exclusion by rotation, and for limiting the number of placemen and pensioners sitting in the house. But if our sovereign for that time being should judge such interposition improper, the great pri|vileges of our nobility are to be the king's counsellors, the protectors of the constitution, and the people's ex|ample. Ought not therefore our independent nobility to take care that such a scheme be properly headed? But should our nobles think otherwise of this subject, and decline assuming to themselves a principal part in the conduct of this infinitely important, though not in|finitely difficult, business, let the great, the rich, the independent city of <HI>London</HI> take the lead.</P>

<P><Q>Provocation will sometimes rouse valour, when a sense of honour will not.

Next day, when <HI>Botta</HI> prepared to chastise the insurgents, he found them grown to a formidable head, and without en|tering into the particulars of the insurrection, all the intripidity and discipline of his troops could not with|stand that spirit of liberty which once more animated these republicans, who for many years had been looked upon as degenerated, even to a proverb. Ac|cording to <HI>Bonamia,</HI> a <HI>British</HI> man of war had been sent thither by his <HI>Sardinian</HI> majesty to bring off for him part of the plunder; and we are told, that that monarch was by no means pleased with the indepen|dent negociation which the <HI>Austrians</HI> had entered into with the <HI>Genoese.</HI> However that may be, it is cer|tain, that <HI>Botta</HI> in his turn made application for some respite of hostilities. But the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages, seized with the same spirit as these of <HI>Genoa,</HI> had by this time taken arms, and poured into the city. The effect was, that the <HI>Austrian</HI> regulars, notwithstanding some advantages they had gained at first, were drawn from one strong post to another, till <HI>Botta</HI> applied to the senate, and under pretence of the capitulation, demanding that they should unarm their soldiers, and join with him in suppressing the insurrection.

<P>A government which opposes and refuses the un|doubted demands of the people, in such manner that the people come to be defeated of their desire, be the subject matter what it will, is no government, but a proper tyranny.

<P><Q>Whenever the fundamentals of a free government are attacked, or any other schemes ruinous to the ge|neral interest of a nation are pursued, the best service that can be done to such a nation, and even to the prince, is to commence an early and vigorous oppo|sition to them; for the event will always shew, as we shall soon see in the present case, that those who form an opposition in this manner, are the truest friends to both, however they may be stigmatized at first with odious names, which belong more properly to those who throw the dirt at them. If the opposi|tion begin late, or be carried on more faintly than
<PB N="440" REF="013851_1464_0F9E2C83C6CF39A0">
the exigency requires, the evil will grow; nay, it will grow the more by such an opposition, till it becomes at length too inveterate for the ordinary methods of cure; and whenever that happens, when|ever usurpations on national liberty are grown too strong to be checked by these ordinary methods, the people are reduced to this alternative: they must ei|ther submit to slavery and beggary, the worst of all political evils, or they must endeavour to prevent the impending mischief by open force and resistance, which is an evil but one degree less eligible than the other. But when the opposition is begun early, and carried on vigorously, there is time to obtain redress of grievances, and put a stop to such usurpations by these gentle and safe methods which their constitu|tion hath provided; methods which may and have often proved fatal to wicked men, but can never prove fatal to the prince himself. He is never in danger but when these methods, which all arbitrary courts dislike, are too long delayed. The most plausible ob|jection to such proceedings, and by which well-mean|ing men are frequently made the bubbles of these who have the worst design, arises from a false notion of moderation. True political moderation consists in not opposing the measures of government, except when great and national interests are at stake; and when that is the case, in opposing them with such a degree of warmth as is adequate to the nature of the evil, to the circumstances of danger attending it, and even to these of opportunity. To oppose upon any other foot, to oppose things which are not blame|worthy, or which are of no material consequence to the national interest, with such violence as may dis|order the harmony of government, is certainly fac|tion;

<P><Q>Parliament has declared it no resistance of magis|trates to side with the just principles of law, nature, and nations.

<P><Q><HI>Britain,</HI> according to our present constitution, cannot be undone by parliaments; for there is some|thing which a parliament cannot do. A parliament cannot annul the constitution; and whilst that is preserved, though our condition may be bad, it can|not be irretrievably so. The legislative is a supreme, and may be called in one sense an absolute, but in none, an arbitrary power. It is limited to the public good of the society. It is a power that hath no other end but preservation, and therefore can never have a right to destroy, enslave, or designedly to impoverish the subjects; for the obligations of the law of nature cease not in society, &amp;c.&mdash;If you therefore put so ex|travagant a case, as to suppose the two houses of par|liament concurring to make at once a formal cession

of their own rights and privileges, and of those of the whole nation, to the crown, and ask who hath the right and the means to resist the supreme legisla|tive power; I answer the whole nation hath the right, and a people who deserve to enjoy liberty will find the means. An attempt of this kind would break the bargain between the king and the nation, between the representative and collective body of the people, and would dissolve the constitution. From hence it follows, that the nation which hath a right to pre|serve this constitution, hath a right to resist an at|tempt that leaves no other means for preserving it but those of resistance. From hence it follows, that if the constitution was actually dissolved, as it would be by such an attempt of the three estates, the people would return to their original, their natural right, the right of restoring the same constitution, or of making a new one. No power on earth could claim any right of imposing a constitution upon them, and less than any that king, those lords, and those com|mons, who having been intrusted to preserve, had destroyed the former.&mdash;But to suppose a case more within the bounds of possibility, though one would be tempted to think it as little within those of pro|bability; let us suppose our parliaments in some fu|ture generation to grow so corrupt, and the crown so rich, that a pecuniary influence constantly prevail|ing over the majority, they should assemble for little else than to establish grievances instead of redressing them; to approve the measures of the court without information; to engage their country in alliances, in treaties, in wars, without examination, and to give money without account, and almost without stint; the case would be deplorable. Our constitution itself
<PB N="443" REF="013851_1467_0F9E2C870F7EC430">
would become our grievance whilst this corruption prevailed; and if it prevailed long, our constitution could not last long; because this slow progress would lead to the destruction of it, as surely as the more concise method of giving it up at once. But in this case the constitution would help itself, and effectually too, unless the whole mass of the people was tainted, and the electors were become no honester than the elected. Much time would be required to beggar and enslave the nation in this manner. It could scarce be the work of one parliament, though parlia|ments should continue to be septennial. It could not be the work of a triennial parliament most cer|tainly; and the people of <HI>Great Britain</HI> would have none to blame but themselves; because, as the con|stitution is a sure rule of action to those whom they chuse to act for them, so it is likewise a sure rule of judgment to them in the choice of their trustees, and particularly of such as have represented them already.

<Q>This was the progress of that transaction, which was con|sidered all <HI>Europe</HI> over as the trial, whether the king or the church were like to prevail. The deci|sion was as favourable as was possible. The king did assume to himself a power to make laws void; and to qualify men for employments, whom the law had put under such incapacities, that all they did was null and void. The sheriff and mayors of towns were no legal officers: judges (one of them being a pro|fessed papist <HI>Alibon</HI>) who took not the test, were no judges: so that the government, and the legal admi|nistration
<PB N="448" REF="013851_1472_0F9E2BD61611E700">
of it, was broken. A parliament returned by such men, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o legal parliament. All this was done by virtue of the dispensing power, which changed the whole frame of our government, and subjected all the laws to the king's pleasure: for upon the same pretence of that power, other declarations might have come out, voiding any other laws that the court found stood in their way; since we had scarce any law that was fortified with such clauses, to force the execution of it, as those that were laid aside, had in them. And when the king pretended that such a sacred point of government, that a petition offered in the modestest terms, and in the humblest manner possible, calling it in question, was made so great a crime, and carried so far against men of such eminence; this I confess satisfied me that there was a total destruction of our constitution avowedly begun, and violently prose|cuted. Here was not jealousies nor fears: the thing was open and avowed. This was not a single act of illegal violence, but a declared design against the whole of our constitution. It was not only the judgment of a court of law: the king had now by two public acts of state renewed in two successive years, openly published his design. This appeared such a total subversion, that according to the princi|ples that some of the highest assertors of submission and obedience, <HI>Barclay</HI> and <HI>Grotius</HI> had laid down, it was now lawful for the nation to look to itself, and see to its preservation. And as soon as any man was convinced that this was lawful, there remained no|thing, but to look to the prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who was the only person that either could save them, or had a right to it: since by all the laws in the world, even private as well as public, he that has in him the re|version of any estate, has a right to hinder the pos|sessor,

<P>When the contest is between a headstrong king, standing by himself, and a set of good ministers, a par|liament, and the whole nation, the strife cannot be long-lived. A tyrant can do nothing without a powerful junto of ministers, and an armed force. If the dispute is between a king, surrounded by a set of ministerial tools, and backed by a mercenary army on one side, and on the other, a faithful parliament, and a free people, the command, which parliament has of the purse, will render it difficult for the court to gain their points. But if the contest is between a de|signing minister, a mercenary army, and a corrupt parliament on one hand, and, on the other, the body of the independent people, the decision may prove difficult, but is most likely to be in favour of liberty, if the people can only unite, and act in concert. For if the cause be unquestionably good, the people will soon have purse, and army, and everything else in their hands.</P>

<P>In a debate during the prosecution of lord <HI>Oxford,</HI> Sir <HI>Watkins Williams Wynne</HI> speaks as follows:</P>
<P><Q>A civil war I shall grant is a terrible misfortune; but it is far from being the most terrible; for I had rather see my country engaged in civil war, than see it tamely submit but for one year to ministerial bon|dage; therefore if this country should be reduced to the fatal dilemma of being obliged to give up its li|berties, or engage in a civil war, I hope no true <HI>Briton</HI> would balance a moment in his choice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus his majesty may be prevailed on, to continue a bad minister at the head of the administration, not|withstanding the people's being generally convinced that he is every day undermining their liberties, by means of a venal and corrupt parliament; and if this
<PB N="451" REF="013851_1475_0F9E2BD889373120">
should be the case, I must conclude that a civil war will certainly ensue; or I must form a much more disagreeable conclusion, which is, that the people of this country are so much degenerated from the virtue and courage of their ancestors, that they chuse rather to submit tamely to slavery, than to run the risk of ascertaining their liberties by the sword <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">DEB. COM. XIII.92.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If the means for preventing slavery have not been provided in the first constitution of a country, or from the changes of times, corruption of manners, insen|sible encroachments, or violent usurpations of princes, have been rendered ineffectual, and the people exposed to all the calamities that may be brought upon them by the weakness, vices, and malice of the prince, or those who govern him, I confess the remedies are more difficult and dangerous; but even in these cases they must be tried. Nothing can be feared, that is worse than what is suffered, or must in a short time fall upon those who are in this condition. They who are al|ready fallen into all that is odious, shameful, and mi|serable, cannot justly fear. When things are brought to such a pass, the boldest counsels are the most safe; and if they must perish who lie still, and they can but perish who are more active, the choice is easily made. Let the danger be never so great, there is a possibility of safety, whilst men have life, hands, arms, and cou|rage to use them; but that people must certainly pe|rish, who tamely suffer themselves to be oppressed, either by the injustice, cruelty, and malice of an ill magistrate, or by those who prevail upon the vices and infirmities of weak princes. It is vain to say, that this may give occasion to men of raising tumults, or civil war; for though these are evils, yet they are not the

<P><Q>It is true, such as would correct errors, and watch that no invasion may be made on liberty, have been heretofore called a faction by the persons in power; but it is not properly the name, and ought to be given to another sort of men. It is wrong to call them the faction, who by all dutiful and modest ways promote the cause of liberty, as the true means to endear a prince to his subjects, and to lay upon them a stronger tie, and obligation to preserve his govern|ment. For a people will certainly best love and de|fend that prince, by whom the greatest immunities, and most good laws have been granted. They can|not properly be termed the faction, who desire a war should be managed upon such a foot of expence as the nation is able to bear; who would have the public treasure not wasted, the prince not deceived in his grants and bargains, who would have the ministry watchful and industrious, and who, when they com|plain, are angry with things, and not with persons. The name of faction does more truly belong to them, who, though the body politic has all the signs of death upon it, yet say, all is well; that the riches of the nation are not to be exhausted; that there is no mis|government in all its business; that it feels no de|cay; that its oeconomy is perfect, and who all the while are as arrogant and assuming, as if they had saved that very people whom their folly and mad con|duct has in a manner ruined.

<P>A designing ministry desires no better than that the people's attention be engaged about trifling grievances, such as have employed us since the late peace. This gives them an opportunity of wreathing the yoke around our necks, because it gives them a pretence for increa|sing the military force. Instructing, petitioning, re|monstrating, and the like, are good diversion for a court; because they know, that, in such ways, nothing will be done against their power. A grand national association for obtaining an independent parliament

<P><Q>The <HI>Romans,</HI> in the Imperial times, destroyed many of the monsters who tyrannized over them. But the greatest advantage gained by their death was a respite from ruin: and the government, which ought to have been established by good laws, depending only upon the virtue of one man, his life proved no more than a lucid interval, and at his death they relapsed into the depth of infamy and misery; and in this condition they continued till that empire was totally subverted. All the kingdoms of the <HI>Arabians, Medes, Persians, Moors,</HI> and others of the East, are of the other sort. Common sense instructs them, that bar|barous pride, cruelty and madness, grown to extre|mity, cannot be born: but they have no other way than to kill the tyrant, and to do the like to his suc|cessor, if he fall into the same crimes. Wanting that wisdom and valour which is required for the institu|tion of a good government, they languish in perpetual slavery, and propose to themselves nothing better than to live under a gentle master, which is a precarious life, and little to be valued by men of bravery and spirit. But those nations that are more generous, who set a higher value upon liberty, and better un|derstand the ways of preserving it, think it a small matter to destroy a tyrant, unless they can also destroy the tyranny. They endeavour to do the work thoroughly, either by changing the government intirely, or reforming it according to the first institu|tion, and making such good laws as may preserve its integrity when reformed.

<P>I know nothing of war, and therefore can propose nothing concerning the conduct of it; but to wish that it may be avoided if possible. Of all the evils to which human nature is obnoxious, none, excepting fixed slavery, is so formidable as war; and of all wars <HI>civil</HI> war is the most to be dreaded.</P>
<P>When I proposed, p. 428, to draw out a plan for restoration of independency to parliament, I intended to prescribe minutely the steps to be taken for that purpose. But on more mature consideration it oc|curred to me, that in tracing out this plan I should naturally be led to touch upon some particulars which might alarm the more timorous part of readers, and render them less inclined to join the grand national association. I therefore chose to proceed no farther; but to leave to the wisdom of succeeding times to deter|mine the particular steps to be taken from the associ|ation to the obtaining of the great object, excepting what may be learned from the histories and precedents I have here given of associations for such national purposes.</P>
<P><PB N="458" REF="013851_1482_0F9E2BDFF0BDAD28">Look down, O King of kings, and Ruler of nations, from where thou sittest enthroned high above all heighth, clothed in uncreated majesty, and surround|ed with that light to which none can approach, look down upon this once favoured nation, and behold the difficulties and the dangers which now surround us. Rend asunder the thick and gloomy cloud which now hangs over us, big with tempest, and ready to burst upon our heads, and shine forth with brighter beams than those of the meridian sun on this once happy land, once the abode of peace and virtue, the temple of liberty, civil and religious.</P>
<P>Open the eyes of this unthinking people, that they may see the hideous precipice, on the brink of which they stand, and in time regain a station of security for the commonwealth, before it sinks in ruins never more to rise.</P>
<P>Send forth a spirit of wisdom, and of union, of submission to wise and just government, and of cour|age to resist oppression and tyranny.</P>
<P>Save the virtue of this great multitude, in danger of being utterly destroyed by corruption. Save the protestant religion, for which so many of thy faithful servants have bravely laid down their lives, and from the blaze of the cruel fires which consumed their bodies, ascended to celestial glory. Let not the in|fernal cloud of popish delusion any more, in this land, obscure the brightness of that system of truth which descended from thy throne, and which shews the way thitherward to every faithful votary of religious truth. Time was when this favoured land was the very bul|wark of reformed religion. O let it never lose that glorious title. Let this one country at least possess the inestimable treasure.</P>
<P><PB N="459" REF="013851_1483_0F9E2BE099CBD608">Break thou the iron sceptre with which tyrants break and destroy the liberties of mankind. Let the envenomed worms of the earth know that it never was thy intention that they should devour their fellow-worms, their subjects. Assert thy supreme dominion over those who impiously pretend to be thy vicegerents upon earth, to which honour they know Thou hast never called them, and that the unjust authority they assume they have obtained by wicked craft, or by law|less violence, and the effusion of human blood.</P>
<P>Thou art thyself the glorious patron of liberty. Thy intention was, that man should be free. Thy service is perfect freedom. The decrees of the puny tyrants of this world are often impious and rebellious against thy supreme commands, which are all righteous and good, and worthiest to be obeyed. Let the encroaching tyrant, let the corruptor of the people, and the per|secutor on account of religious opinions, cease from this land. Let the voice of perjury be no more heard; let the damning bribe be no more seen in this coun|try. Or if any have polluted themselves with the ac|cursed thing which troubleth our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mp, may the pangs of conscience seize upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, may the powers of the world to come amaze and ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fy them, and may they, before it be too late, give up the wages of corruption, the price of their betrayed country.</P>
<P>Put it into the hearts of those whose station gives them the power, to restore to the people willingly, and without compulsion, their unalienable rights and privileges. Inspire them with the wise and humane consideration, that, as the shepherds of the people, as the fathers of their country, they are obliged to deny themselves, to mortify their desire of riches, power, and pleasure, and without waiting for the so|licitations of the people, they ought to prevent their

wishes, to offer and hold out to them whatever is for their advantage.</P>
<P>Let the cause of civil and religious liberty prove victorious. May the divine presence be to the de|fenders of liberty a pillar of light, and of defence, and to the host of the oppressors a pillar of cloud, of darkness and confusion. Arise, and come forth from thy sacred seat, clothed in all thy terrors. Let thy lightnings enlighten the world. Let thy thunders shake the mountains. Let dismay and horror overwhelm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> courage of thine enemies.</P>
<P>In thy hands, O Father and Preserver of all, doth thy servant desire to leave his King and Country, in the hope that they shall be safe under thy heavenly protection; and to Thee doth he consecrate this and all his weak but well-intentioned labours for the good of his fellow creatures, humbly hoping, that his in|firmities shall be overlooked, and his offences blotted out; not on account of any merit in himself, but through the magnanimity of him who is hereafter to judge the world in righteousness and in mercy.</P>
