<HEAD>TO THE Reader.</HEAD>
<P>IF there is (as who can say their is not?) a <HI>Declension</HI> in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> from what once they were, it is not to be wondred at: For in the Primitive Dayes of Chris|tianity it was so; and this whilest the Apostles were yet Living. In the Churches in <HI>Galatia,</HI> there was a Super|stitious observation of <HI>Holy-daye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> &amp; of <HI>Meats</HI> and <HI>Drinks.</HI> And in those in <HI>Asia</HI> were greater Errors, and a Scandalous neglect of Discipline in several of them. But in the very next Age to the Apostles, the <HI>Defection</HI> from <HI>Primitive Purity,</HI> was greater and more general, especially in matters relating to <HI>Church-Discipline.</HI> Then began the Contest about the Day when <HI>Easter</HI> should be kept. <HI>Polycarp</HI> (the Bishop of <HI>Smyrna</HI> who was an Holy man,
<PB N="4" REF="001077_0004_0FAFDF02B60383C0">
&amp; Dyed a Martyr) and the <HI>Asian</HI> Churches with him, pleaded for its Observation on the Fourteenth day of the Month. <HI>A|nicetus</HI> (the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI>) and with him the <HI>Western</HI> Churches, would keep the Fifteenth day: The former pretending the Authority of the Apostle <HI>Iohn</HI> for their practice, and the latter the Autho|rity of <HI>Peter.</HI> And how strange is it, that <HI>Polycrates</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Ephesus</HI> in his Let|ter to <HI>Victor</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> that so he might make <HI>Iohn</HI> to be of greater Authority then <HI>Peter,</HI> alledged that he was a Priest, and wore the the High-Priests Golden Crown, when as 'tis known that <HI>Iohn</HI> was of the Tribe of <HI>Iudah</HI>; nor would any Christian put on those Sacerdotal Ornaments. It is to be admired, that they who lived so near the dayes of the Apostles, should pretend their Authority for a practice in the Churches which they never taught. <HI>Ireneus</HI> in <HI>Eusebius</HI> sayes that in this, <HI>Their Fore-fathers had delivered to their Posterity a Custome which crept into the Churches through Ignorance.</HI> And <HI>Socrates</HI> in his <HI>Ecclesiastical History,</HI> acknowledgeth tru|ly, that neither our Saviour nor His A|postles, did Ordain the keeping of that

Holiday. Other usages not warrante<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by the Scripture, were observed in many Churches within a few Ages of the A|postles. We find in <HI>Iustin Martyr</HI>'s second <HI>Apology,</HI> that they mixed Water with the Wine, at the Lords Supper; and that the Deacons carried the Elements to such as were absent: both which practices were not according to <HI>Divine Institution</HI>: And yet it was thus within Fifty Years after some of the Apostles were living. Like|wise additions to the Sacrament of Bap|tism, such as, <HI>Oyle, Milk, Honey, signing with the sign of the Cross, and Superstitious Garments</HI>; with other Ceremonies, crept into the Churches in the early Times of Christianity, and made way for <HI>Popery.</HI> So did <HI>the Glory by degrees depart</HI> from the Churches. None of these Super|stitions do as yet obtain in the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI>: But what may in pro|cess of Time, who can tell?</P>
<P>It has been objected to <HI>Non-conformist's,</HI> that Modes and Forms of Worship, and Church Discipline, are <HI>small Matters,</HI> and not Essentials of Religion, and that therefore men should not Cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd about

them, or expose themselves to Persecu|tion on the account of such Inconsiderable matters.</P>
<P>That Pious and Learned Divine (who was Tutor to the late Arch Bishop <HI>Tillot|son,</HI> when in the University) Mr <HI>Clerkson</HI> in his Sermons on <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.10. has Large|ly, and Judiciously Answered such Ob|jectors;
<Q>Shewing how the Faithful Ser|vants of Christ have chosen rather to submit to the extremest Sufferings then to Sin, though it were but in a circum|stance of Divine Worship: And that things which are but small in their first beginning, may become great in their Progress and tendency: <HI>e. g.</HI> Imposed Forms of Prayer, made way for the <HI>Mass,</HI> and for all the Coruptions of it. If stinted Liturgies had not been at first yielded to, the Popish Mass could never have taken place. Again, the first step to the Popes Throne, was the introdu|cing of a Superiority amongst ordinary Officers in the Church. This by degrees rose to the Papal Heighth. The Com|memoration of Saints and Martyrs at the place of their Sepulchres, made way for the Idolatry of Prayer to them. If
<PB N="7" REF="001077_0007_0FAFDF058AAAC620">
the first commemoration had not bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> admitted, then the other had never fol+lowed. If men have power to Institut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one Religious Ceremony, they may as well appoint an hundred. Moreover, the introducing of small matters, may en|danger that which is the main Bulwark of the Protestant Religion. This Prin|ciple, That <HI>nothing but the Scripture is the Rule of Faith and Worship, is that Bulwark.</HI> If by giving way to small mat|ters pretended to be Indifferent, we let go that Principle, all our Religion is in danger. He further adds, that the smaller the matter is which we suffer for, presuming it to be an Evil, the more Honourable and the more Com|fortable will our Sufferings be. It is a great Honour to Christ, that He has any in the world who will suffer much, rather then swerve from Him in the least. And it will be Comfortable to those that Suffer, because this will argue much Love to Christ, and great Fear of Sin, and so will be a great Evidence of Sincerity. Here is the greatest Try<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, when we are called to suffer for that which is counted a small matter&punc;</Q>

<P>Answ. 1. <HI>When God Himself goes from them, then the Glory is gone.</HI> The design of this Vision was to intimate this. The <HI>Iews</HI> thought that God would never go out of the Temple, but that as long as they had the Temple they were sure e|nough of the Lords being amongst them.

Glory does not use to stay long after them. Especially, this is true of Men in Publick place, who are eminently Faithful. A Magistrate who is not of a worldly, selfish, private Spirit, but whose Heart is set for God, has a great Presence of the Lord with him, Judg, 2.18, 19. <HI>When the Lord raised them up Iudges then the Lord was with the Iudge, and delivered them out of the hand of their Enemies, all the dayes of the Iudge.</HI> As long as that Eminent man Lived, the Glory departed not; but as soon as he was Dead, sad Changes came upon the Land in a little time.

by a Faithful and Impartial Ex|ercise of that Holy Discipline, which Christ has Commanded, the Lord and His Glory will not long abide in that Church. He cannot endure to dwell where sin is indulged. It is grievous to an Holy man, to be amongst those that allow themselves in Wickedness. Psal. 120.5. <HI>Wo is me that I sojourn in</HI> Mesech, <HI>and dwell in the Tents of</HI> Kedar. And will the Holy God dwell in such Tents as these are? It is a sign that the Lord is withdrawn from men, when they are left to Scandalous Sins. And when they give way to such sins, they provoke Him to depart from them more dreadfully, and so to deprive them of their Glory.

<P>We come now to the Second Enquiry proposed, Viz.</P>
<P>Enqui. 2. <HI>HOW does it appear that God remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es His Glory by degrees, and not all at once? Or, what are the several steps which the Lord useth to obser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in His dispensations towards His people before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is a Total departure of the Glory from them?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>God does not use to depart, or remove the Glory from a People with|out giving them warning of it.</HI> He does by His Word give solemn warning of His departure. Jer. 23.39. <HI>I will forsake
<PB N="48" REF="001077_0048_0FAFDF62B6B6A338">
you, and cast you out of my presence.</HI> The Lord stirreth up the Hearts of His Messengers, to give notice that the Glory is going before the removal of it: And this it may be a long time before hand. So did God deal with the Old world. <HI>Noah</HI> continued Preach|ing to them, and Warning them an Hundred and Twenty Years before the Flood came, which put an end to all their Glory. Thus also did the Lord deal with the <HI>Iews.</HI> He sent many Pro|phets to them. There are above Twenty Prophets whose Names are men|tioned in the Scripture, by whom the Lord warned that People. The Prophet <HI>Ieremiah</HI> for Three and Twenty Years together (as himself takes notice) told them what was coming. <HI>Ier.</HI> 25.3. Some write that Forty Five Years expired, before that Prophet finished the course of his Ministry. Several other Men of God continued Prophecying that the Glory would be removed, some of them above Fifty Years. And thus Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> dealt with the Churches in <HI>Asia.</HI> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> did not remove those Candlesticks ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their places without first giving them
<PB N="49" REF="001077_0049_0FAFDF637AD16368">
solemn Warnings about it&punc; And this is the <HI>first</HI> step towards the removal of the <HI>Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God does not use to bring all His Iudgments on a People at once, but He is wont to begin with lesser and so to proceed unto greater Iudgments.</HI> If a lesser Judg|ment will not awaken, then He brings another <HI>Seven</HI> times greater: and if that won't do, then another <HI>Seven</HI> times great|er then the former. Thus did the Lord threaten His People, Lev. 26.21. <HI>If you will walk contrary to me, &amp; will not hearken to me, I will bring Seven times more Plagues upon you, according to your Sins.</HI> And again, he sayes, 23. <HI>If you will not be reformed by these things, I will punish you yet seven times for your si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</HI> We find in the Prophets, that the Lords proceeding with His people, were according to those holy Threatnings of His word. Isa. 9.1. <HI>At the first He lightly afflicted the Land of</HI> Zebulon, <HI>and the Land of</HI> Naphtali, <HI>and afterwards did more grievously afflict her.</HI> Thus it was, first one of the Kings of <HI>Assyria</HI> came a|gainst the Ten Tribes, and put them under Contribution, making them to pay a Thousand Talents of Silver, which amounted unto above Three Hundred
<PB N="50" REF="001077_0050_0FAFDF64417104C0">
and Forty Thousand Pounds Sterling. After that, there came another King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> and depopulated a considerable part of the Countrey, making the In|habitants his Captives. After that, there came a third King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> viz. <HI>Shalm|anasser,</HI> and he destroyed the Capital City, and proved a sweeping Judgment to the whole Land. So was the Glory Total|ly and Eternally removed from all the <HI>Ten</HI> Tribes. To the like purpose does the Lord speak by the Prophet <HI>Hosea,</HI> saying, <HI>I will be to</HI> Ephraim <HI>as a Moth.</HI> You know a <HI>Moth</HI> does leasurely and by degrees consume and marr mens Clothes. In like manner, from the Death of <HI>Ie|reboam,</HI> God had been weakning <HI>Ephra|im,</HI> viz. the Ten Tribes by various Judg|ments, especially by Divisions among themselves. <HI>And to the House of</HI> Judah <HI>as Rottenness</HI>; or as a <HI>Worm,</HI> as the Ori|ginal word imports. A <HI>Worm</HI> does not Rot the wood all at once, but gradually. Thus was it with the Two Tribes, called <HI>The House of</HI> Judah: Lesser Judgments were the forerunners of, and but prepa|ratory to Greater, which issued in a To|tal removal of the Glory. It is there|fore
<PB N="51" REF="001077_0051_0FAFDF64F7A0B518">
further added in the Fourteenth verse, <HI>I will be to</HI> Ephraim <HI>as a Lion, and as a Young Lion to the House of</HI> Judah, <HI>I even I will Tear and go away.</HI> Thus we see, that lesser make way for <HI>Tearing Iudgments</HI> at last. The Lord comes on His People first as a <HI>Moth,</HI> but after that as a <HI>Lion.</HI> Now as Judgments come, the Glory goes away: and are there|fore signs and forerunners thereof. The Death of a Professing people is in the Total Departure of the Glory. Now, as Diseases do by degrees bring Death on the Body, so lesser Judgments do by degrees insensibly weaken a People, and make way for that Judgment which at last proves fatal to them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>God useth to favour His People with a day of Grace.</HI> He giveth time for Re|pentance. Rev. 2.21. <HI>I gave her space to Repent.</HI> And He useth means with them to bring them to Repentance, that so a Total removal of the Glory may be pre|vented. Yea, the Lord often visits His People with great variety of means. What could be done more? He prove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them with Mercies. He tries whether

Accord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng to His manifold Mer|cies, He gave them saviours who saved them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut of the hand of their Enemies: And ma|ny Times did He deliver them according to His Mercies.</HI> Neh. 9.27, 28. And He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ries what Afflictions will do When Publick Calamities come, the voice of those Judgments, is, <HI>This People have Sin|ned, Let them Repent.</HI> And the Lord Graciously waits to see what effect those Judgments will have, whether men will thereby be brought to Repentance or no. Isa. 30.18. <HI>Therefore will the Lord wait that He may be Gracious to you.</HI> In the mean time, He continues calling on them by His Word, and striving with them by His Holy Spirit, and this per|haps for many Years together, before there is a Total removal of the Glory. Neh. 9.30. <HI>Many Years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit in thy Prophets.</HI> Nor does all the Glory alwayes depart as soon as the Day of Grace is expired.</P>
<P>For;</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>There is a Day of meer Patience.</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="001077_0053_0FAFDF6676A8C470">
The day of Grace may be past with a particular person, and with a people also, when nevertheless, the day of Patience may still continue. Was it not so with the Old world? Did not the day of Di|vine Patience continue, for the space of an Hundred and Twenty Years after God had determined that His Spirit should cease striving with them? <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3. Was it not so with the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> in the wilderness? <HI>Vnto whom He Sware in his Wrath that they should not en|ter into His rest.</HI> Psal. 95.11.

Then was the day of Grace expi|red: For God had determined not to have Mercy on them. Yet the dayes of Patience were not at an end: For after this they had the Name of <HI>Loammi</HI> given to them, intimating the Expiration of the Day of Patience as well as of the Day of Grace. And was it not thus with the <HI>Iews?</HI> When Christ said concerning them,

<P N="5">5. <HI>At last the Dayes of Patience are ended.</HI> The Lord bears a long time with the Transgressions of his People, Ezek. 2.3. <HI>They and their Fathers have Transgressed against me even to this very day.</HI> But He will not bear alwayes. And when once it is come to that, God de|parts, and the Glory is gone. No To|kens of the Lords Gracious and Glo|rious Presence are any more to be seen in such a place, or among such a people.

It is then possible that in after Ages, it may be said, Go and see what God has done to <HI>New-England,</HI> because of the Apostacy, and the Iniquity of the People there. Thus also concern|ing <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> which was the <HI>City of So|lemnities</HI>; and there was more of the Glory of God in it, then in all the world besides: Nevertheless, that Glory was removed from them for <HI>Seventy</HI> Years together. And, although the Lord was so Gracious, as in some measure to re|store the Glory, they at last Sinned it quite away. Nor has there been any Glory there for these many Generati|ons. What is <HI>Ierusalem</HI> at this day, but a Miserable Town, in which are no Inhabitants, besides Infidels and Idola|ters; not one man in whom the Di|vine Glory dwells.

There is not, nor (which is a very sad word to be spoken, and I wish I might forbear expressing it, but I dare not) is there like to be for ought that yet appears. For alas!

Now if the Wall is removed, will not the Glory remove with it? What can we then expect, but that many Evils will soon break in upon us like a Flood!</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That which some have thought was the special design of Providence in bringing a choice People into this part of the world, seem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s if it were now over.</HI> It has been by Good and Wise men conjectured, that the Lords more peculiar design in Planting these Heavens and Laying the Foundation of this Earth, was, that the world might see a <HI>Specimen</HI> of what shall be over all the Earth in the Glo|rious Times which are Expected, and will certainly be accomplished in the
<PB N="81" REF="001077_0081_0FAFDF7C36688EF0">
appointed season of them. In those dayes what manner of persons will there be in Power as to Civil Government, and what kind of Laws shall there be Established? A Prophet has told us, Isa. 60.17. <HI>I will make thy Officers Peace, and thy Exactors Righteousness.</HI> And in those dayes how will Church-Members be qualified? That we see in the same Prophet, Ver. 21. <HI>Thy people shall be all Righteous.</HI> It was very much thus in <HI>New-England</HI> many years ago. But neither our Civil nor Ecclesiastical State is ever like to be what once it was. All these things considered, we have just cause to fear that a greater Departure of the Glo|ry is hastning upon us.</P>
<P>Consider IV. <HI>How Lamentable our state will be, if the Glory be once Totally re|moved.</HI> The Angels of Heaven lament over such a people. They mourned o|ver <HI>Ierusalem</HI> saying, <HI>The Blessed Glory of the Lord is going from his place.</HI> Ezek. 3.12. So will they mourn over <HI>New-England</HI> if that Blessed Glory should ut|terly depart from us. And it may break our Hearts to think that ever such a

day should come upon us. For alas! When once the Glory is quite gone, it seldom returns again: But as tis said of the Living Creatures in <HI>Ezekiels Vision,</HI> Ezek. 1.17. <HI>They returned not when they went.</HI> So the Glory that went away from the Temple returned not when it went. When the Ark of Old (which did Sym|bolically represent the Divine Glory,) was in Judgment removed from any place it returned thither no more. It re|turned to <HI>Shiloh</HI> no more. It returned to <HI>Ierusalem</HI> no more, after the Lord had in displeasure caused it to be re|moved from those places. Thus when the Lord wholly removes His Gospel from a People, He is not wont to favour them with it again. Look over all <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and you will see dismal Con|firmations of this Truth. But if the Glory goeth away and returns no more, what will come in the room of it? What, but woful Judgments? Mos. 9.12. <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to them when I depart from them.</HI> Yea, NEW-ENGLAND, Wo to thee in the day that the Lord shall depart from thee: In the bitter and doleful Day, when the Lord shall Totally depart from

thee. Such places as have been most Eminent for Religion, and the Light of the Gospel (as <HI>New-England</HI> has) when once they have sinned away that Light become the Darkest and Miserablest places under Heaven. A Famous Divine in <HI>England,</HI> relates that he went on pur|pose to some Towns where once had been an Eminent Ministry, to see how it was with them, and whether there were any footsteps of such a Mercy a|mong them, but (he sayes) <HI>they were all overgrown with Thorns, and Nettles had covered the face thereof.</HI> It is often thus, <HI>Bethels</HI> do afterwards become <HI>Bethav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns.</HI> Was it not said of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> How is <HI>the Faithful City become an Harlot?

If ever the Glory be Totally removed from <HI>New-England,</HI> (which Mercy forbid) this Land will become <HI>one of the</HI> dolefullest spots of Ground on the face of the whole Earth.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Is there no way to prevent the Re|moval of the Glory from us</HI>? Yes there is. I have not spoken these things that

<P>But, <HI>What then is to be done</HI>?</P>
<P>Answ. <HI>Let us hearken to the Counsel which Christ from Heaven giveth to us, viz.</HI> That in Rev. 2.5. <HI>Remember f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om whence thou art fallen, Repent, and do thy first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll remove the Candlestick out of its place.</HI> Oh that <HI>New-England</HI> were now what once it was!

<P>&mdash; The Throne of his Glory.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS with the preceeding Chapter contains the substance of a Sermon Preached by our Lord Jesus Christ, unto his Disciples. The conclusion of the Sermon (which begins with this Verse) contains a description of <HI>the Day of Iudgment</HI>; wherein there is an allusion unto the Jewish <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> or <HI>great Court of Iudgment</HI>: in which besides the <HI>Nasi</HI> or <HI>Chief Iudge,</HI> there were Seventy other <HI>Iudges</HI>; and there were <HI>Scribes</HI> appointed, some at the <HI>Right-hand</HI> of the Judge, who did set down the <HI>Votes</HI> for <HI>Absolution</HI>&punc; Others at the <HI>Left-hand</HI> of the Judge, who did set down the <HI>Votes</HI> for <HI>Condemnation.</HI> There is an Allusion thereunto, in that Description of the <HI>Day of Iudgment,</HI> which we have in the lat|ter part of this Chapter. In this Verse there are three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. An Intimation <HI>who shall be the Iudge</HI> in that Day; <HI>The Son of Man shall come in his Glory.</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="001077_0099_0FAFDF2539BF2848">
That is the <HI>Lord Iesus Christ,</HI> who is not only <HI>a</HI> Son of Man, as the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> was of|ten called, Son of man; but <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> is <HI>the</HI> Son of Man. He is <HI>that</HI> Son of Man whom <HI>Daniel</HI> in a Glorious Vision saw <HI>coming in the Clouds of Heaven</HI>; and that did receive a <HI>King|dom</HI> and <HI>Dominion over all Nations. He</HI> is also said to be <HI>the Son of Man</HI> in that he is not only truely Man, but the <HI>Second Adam.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Here is mentioned, who shall be the <HI>Officers</HI> attending the Judge in that Day; <HI>viz. The Holy Angels.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. We have a description of the <HI>Throne,</HI> which he shall then <HI>sit upon,</HI> in the Words be|fore us, <HI>He shall sit on the Throne of his Glory.</HI></P>
<P>The words are an <HI>Hebraism,</HI> The <HI>Throne of his Glory,</HI> that is to say, <HI>a very Glorious Throne.</HI></P>

Tribes of Israel.</HI> And thence in that expression in the Scripture, of the <HI>Throne of Iudgment.</HI> But thus is it most true concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, that he has a <HI>Iudiciary Power</HI> granted to him, and such a <HI>Power of Iudgment</HI> as none else in the world has, Joh 5.22. <HI>The Father judges no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son</HI> When it is said the <HI>Fa|th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r judges no man,</HI> the meaning of it is, that he does not <HI>immediately</HI> judge, but by his Son Jesus Christ. The Father judgeth no man without him, but all men by him. Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> sometimes represented in the Scripture as Sit|ting on a <HI>Throne</HI> in respect of those <HI>Temporal Iudgments</HI> which he does cause to be Executed on men in this World, <HI>Ezek</HI> 1.26. The Pro|phet in a Vision beheld <HI>a Throne, and a man sitting on it</HI>; The Design of that Vision is to intimate that the Lord Jesus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssed a Sentence of <HI>Destruction</HI> on the Jews, and that he had commanded the <HI>Babylonians</HI> to be the Executioners of his Wrath upon them; but especially Christ is represented as sitting on a Throne, on the account of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntence of <HI>Iudgment</HI> which he will pass on all men at the <HI>Last Day.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Regal Authority does belong to Christ.</HI> A <HI>Throne</HI> is, <HI>insigne R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gium,</HI> that which some|times is peculiar to <HI>Kings</HI>; a <HI>King</HI> is described to be one that <HI>Sits on a Throne</HI>; there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Throne that is a <HI>Kingly Throne.</HI> 'Tis sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

But some Ages since, <HI>Antichrist</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> been both revealed and in a great measure consumed by the Spirit of Christ in his Word, which is a sure sign that <HI>the brightness of his Coming,</HI> that is&punc; His <HI>Coming in F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aming Fire,</HI> is not far off Moreover, we that now live see those very things concerning which the Lord has said, <HI>When you see th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se things come to pass, know that the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand, Luke</HI> 21.31. Are we not then concerned to watch and Pray always, that we may be counted worthy to stand before the Son of Man?
