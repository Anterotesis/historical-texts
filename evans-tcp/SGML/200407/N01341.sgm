<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HOW <HI>Pious</HI> or <HI>Learned</HI> the Author of the Book I undertake to answer may be, I am no more concern'd to know, than I am who the Author is, whom the Publisher hath thought fit to commend as such; and having so done, to conceal. But he is not (as far as I conceive) the more <HI>Learned</HI> or <HI>Pious</HI> for Writing this Book: Not the more <HI>Learned</HI>; for by all the helps he professes to have had from <HI>Didoclavius,</HI> &amp;c. he is guilty of many gross and palpable Mistakes: And not the more <HI>Pious,</HI> because of the uncharitable Reflections and Inferences he every where makes. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r would any man of a truly Christian Temper alledge these things now against the Common-Prayers, which were alter'd or expunged above thirty years before he publish'd his <HI>Brief Discourse?</HI> Or charge us with <HI>violating</HI> the Word of God, because we change the word <HI>Sabbath</HI> for the <HI>Seventh</HI> Day; or say that we sacrilegiously steal from it, because <HI>Hallelujah,</HI> or <HI>Praise the Lord,</HI> is sometimes left out in the Reading-Psalms; or that we equal the Apocrypha to, or set it up above the Canonical Scriptures, because it's read on the Highest Holy-days (as he saith, but not very truly) tho the Articles of our Church expresly declare them to be only of hamane composition. Suppose now I should treat this Author after the same manner; and whereas he pro|fesses to have <HI>compared</HI> our <HI>Liturgy</HI> with the <HI>Missal</HI> &amp;c. I should take all advantages given in his Book, to shew, that notwithstanding this, he had never read them. I am certain, I could much more easily, and as charitably do it, as he make good his abovesaid Charge. For would any one conversant in the <HI>Missal, Breviary</HI> and <HI>Ritual</HI> of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> have said (as he doth, <HI>p 5.) That</HI> Beza <HI>notes, that in the</HI> Roman <HI>Liturgy men are taught to cry,</HI> Iesu Miserere mei, <HI>no less than ten times one after ano|ther?</HI> For what need he quote <HI>Beza</HI> for that which he has (as he saith) read himself; and which after all, <HI>Beza</HI> mistook, and he with <HI>Beza</HI>; or rather h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mistakes <HI>Beza</HI> in; since the <HI>Jesu Miserere</HI> thus repeated, is not in the <HI>Missal,</HI> &amp;c. but in private Offices of that Church. Who again, that had been conversant in our Liturgy, would have said as the Author, <HI>Some have observ'd that of 172 Apocryphal Chapters, but 38 are omitted</HI>? For

what need be to be beholden to another's <HI>Observation,</HI> for what he that had thus read the Liturgy must have under his own eye? So easy it is to repay him in his own Coin, if we will reflect and infer after his way.</P>
<P>It's a shrewd sign this Author was hard put to it to make good his Charge against the Liturgy, and to prove his Point, That it's unlawful to <HI>be pre|sent at the Common-Prayer Worship.</HI></P>
<P>And after all, it's of little Service to our Author, and those of his Com|munion, to make such Exceptions as he has done; for if all things were alter'd and remov'd that he obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts against, they of his way would be no nearer to us than they are, as the things stand at present; as long as we are a National Church, and have a Liturgy; and whilst they continue Independant and Congregational, are against the use of any Forms, even such as are Scrip|tural (as the Lord's Prayer and Decalogue); nay, against reading the Scriptur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in their Publick Congregations.</P>
<P>Indeed he had dealt more sincerely, if he had acquainted his Reader; That they hold it unlawful to communicate with us, because we are a Na|tional Church; and that they dont joyn in the Common-Prayer Worship, because it's a Form, and all Forms are in his Opinion unlawful.

<HEAD>A BRIEF DISCOURSE Concerning the Lawfulness of Worshipping GOD BY THE COMMON-PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Question proposed by the Author, is,</P>
<P>Q <HI>What are the Reasons why you judge it unlawful to be present at, or to partake in the Common Prayer Worship?</HI></P>
<P>The Reason he gives are four taken,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>From the Original of the Common-Prayer-Book, which,</HI> saith he, <HI>with the Ceremonies and Worship prescribed therein, I find to be in a great measure Popish and Heathenish.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From the Matter of the Common Prayer-Book</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Because Publick Liturgies of Humane Composure, are an Innovation and Deviation from Primitive Purity.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>In this Age of Light, it would be a great Apostacy in the least to coun|tenance or comply with the Common-Prayer-Worship.</HI></P>
<P>These are the Reasons he advances, and by which he endeavours to justify their continuance in a Separation from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Worship therein Administred.</P>
<P>And these I shall take the liberty to examine.</P>
<P>For the clearer discoursing upon which, I shall divide what I have to say, into so many Chapters, <HI>viz.</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Original of the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Author saith, <HI>That the Common Prayer Book, with the Ceremonies and Worship prescribed therein, are in a great measure Popish and Heathenish</HI>; and therefore it is unlawful to joyn with it.</P>
<P>This will be resolved into Two Questions.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> 1. Whether the Common Prayer be taken out of the Mass-Book, and be Heathenish, as well as Popish?</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> 2. Whether the being taken-out of the Mass-Book, makes it unlawful to be used or joyned with, tho' it be good and lawful in it self?</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> 1. Whether the Common Prayer is taken out of the Mass Book? As our Author takes care to represent it, one would think there is little of the <HI>Roman</HI> Service left out in ours. <HI>The Common Prayer,</HI> saith he, <HI>is in a great measure Popish &mdash; is taken out of the Popes Mass Book &mdash; it cannot be denied it's derived from thence,</HI> p 1. <HI>There is very little in the</HI> English, <HI>which is not to be found in the other,</HI> p. 2. This is matter of Fact, and so is not to be determined by Authority. He himself makes a fair proposal, which I shall accept of, viz <HI>Let such as have any hesitancy about this mat|ter compare the Popish Missal,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>with the</HI> English <HI>Liturgy, and they will be cenvinced,</HI> That he had never read and compared them; or is guilty of a notorious Abuse that he puts upon his Ignorant Reader, that after he pretends to have read and compared, shall assert so gross a falshood, and say, There is very little in the <HI>English,</HI> that is not to be found in the other, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. For there is little comparatively in the <HI>English,</HI> which is to be found in the <HI>Roman</HI> Liturgy, and far more is left out, than ever was taken thence. This is indeed directly contrary to what he affirms, and yet let any one compare them, and he will be convinced of the truth of it. Take that which is called <HI>the Canon of the Mass,</HI> or Form of Admini|string the Eucharist, and there is no Agreement, not one Collect or Prayer the same. Go we to Baptism, there is not one Prayer belonging to that Office that is in ours. And as for the Litany, there is not a third part of theirs in ours, and much in ours which is not in theirs.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is nothing in the Service of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which makes it <HI>the Popes Missal,</HI> and is peculiar to that Church, that is in ours; that is, there is no Popery in our Liturgy. This he is in part forced to acknow|ledge.
<PB N="3" REF="001592_0007_0FB3D95F932DFD08">
<HI>There are,</HI> saith he, <HI>things (as Prayers for the Dead,</HI> &amp;c.) <HI>in the</HI> Roman <HI>Liturgy, which are not translated into</HI> English. His <HI>Et cetera,</HI> if branched into particulars, would be very large, as he could not but know, if he had <HI>read</HI> and <HI>compared</HI> them. As for Example, Where are their Crossings, Elevati|on, and Adoration of the Elements? Where their Solitary Communion, and Communion in one kind? Where their frequent Crossings of themselves, and of the Book? Where their material Crosses, and the Adoration of them? Where their Prayers for the Dead? Where their Intercessors, the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> and Saints, that are to be found in the Canon of the Mass? Where are the many Exorcisms, the Puffs they blow in the Infants face, their Conjuration of Salt, <HI>for a wholesome Sacrament to the driving away of Devils,</HI> that's put into the Mouth of the Infant, <HI>as a Propitia|tion unto Eternal Life</HI>? Where the Spittle with which the Ears and Nostrils of the Infant are touched with an <HI>Ephphatha, be opened</HI>? Where the <HI>Oyl of Salvation,</HI> (as it's call'd) wherewith the Priest anoints the Child's Breast and Shouldiers in form of a Cross? Where the Chrism or Oyntment wherewith he anoints the Crown of the Head in figure of a Cross? Where the change of Garments, their Purple and White Robe, that the Child is to <HI>carry unspotted before the Tribunal of our Lord</HI>? Where the lighted Candle put into the Child's hand, that <HI>when our Lord shall come to the Wedding, he may meet him</HI>? Where the many Crossings of the Head before Baptism, and of the Eyes, Ears, Nostrils, Breast, Shouldiers, Mouth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be found in their Ritual and Pasto|ral? <HI>Lastly,</HI> To go no further, Where are the <HI>O Holy</HI> Mary, <HI>Mother of God,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>pray for us</HI>? Where are the Angels and Arch-Angels, the Patriachs and Prophets the Apostles and Evangelists; the Martyrs, Popes and Con|fessors, the Priests and Levites, the Monks and Hermits, the Virgins and Widows, the Forty seven Saints in particular, and all Saints in general, that are called upon in their Litiny, <HI>Pray for us</HI>? And if no|thing that is truly Popish be to be found in our Liturgy, we have so far reason to deny that it's taken out of the Mass-Book.</P>
<P N="3">3. I add, That our Service is so far from being taken out of the Missal, that whatsoever in it is the same with the Office in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> is mostly taken out of the Ancient Offices of the Christian Church. And because every one cannot compare it, I will produce Impartial Au|thority for it. Thus saith Mr. <HI>Ball,</HI> a Nonconformist of great Note in the last Age, <HI>The</HI> English <HI>Liturgy is not a Collection out of the Mass Book, but a refining of the Liturgy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of the Grounds of Separ. <HI>c.</HI> 8. <HI>p.</HI> 152.</NOTE> <HI>which heretofore had been stained with the Mass, &mdash; and is not a Trans|lation of the Mass, but a Restitution of the Ancient Liturgies.</HI> So the Ministers of <HI>Old England,</HI> in a Letter to the Ministers
<PB N="4" REF="001592_0008_0FB3D961142C6DC0">
of <HI>New England,</HI> wrote <HI>Anno</HI> 1637 <HI>It's no hard task to shew, that our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er|vice Book was reformed in most things according to the purest Liturgies, which were in use long before the Mass was heard of in the World,</HI> p. 2.</P>
<P>To these I will add one more, for the Character our Author gives of him, <HI>viz</HI> Bishop <HI>Iewel</HI> (whom he calls <HI>that great Light in the</HI> English <HI>Church,</HI> p. 9) Who saith, <HI>We are come as near as possibly we could to the Church of Apostles, and of the old Catholick Bishops and Fathers. &mdash; And besides we have aimed not only our Doctrine, but Sacraments also, and Form of our Publick Prayers after the patern of their Rites and Ordinances.</HI></P>
<P>To say the truth, its a very odd thing to represent our Liturgy as Popish, when those that composed and useth the Liturgy, were burnt by the Papists for it, and when to this day they will not communicate in it, nor with the Church that used it. Our Author saith, <HI>There have been Iesuits and Popish Intelligencers that approved of our Service, and Pope</HI> Pius 5<HI>th would have ratified it?</HI> And is it therefore Po|pish? The Independant allows the Presbyterian Confession of Faith; And this Author saith, p. 4 <HI>It must be acknowledged that such of the Church-of</HI> England-<HI>men, as keep to the</HI> 39 <HI>Articles in matter of Doctrine, are as Ortho|dox as any Protestants in the World.</HI> And is therefore the Independant a Presbyterian, or this Author a Church-of-<HI>England</HI> man? I trow not. All is, that they agree in the common Principles the other receives, and yet one is no more the other, than if they had no agreement in such Prin|ciples. And so is it here, the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy has nothing but what is agreeable to the Doctrine of the Gospel, and allowable by the Christian Church; and therefore what the Papist will, or ought to allow; but for all that, we are no more Papists, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or that any more Popish, than the Independant is a Presbyterian, or our Author a Church-of-<HI>England</HI>-man. It was not then, because it was Popish, that they ap|proved of our Service, but that it was Christian, and pure in its Order and Composure: It was not because it was Popish, that the Pope would have ratified it, but because upon any terms he would have prevailed upon Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to own his Authority, and regain'd her to their Church.</P>
<P N="4">4. However I deny not, but that the Compilers of the Liturgy did peruse the Popish Offices, and take as much from thence, as was confor|madable to the Ancient Offices, and was fit to be used; and that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that they might the more easily satisfy doubting or dis|contented Minds under the Alterations then made, and induce them to comply with them. And this was the meaning of King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Proclamation. A practice very Christian and commendable, and agree|able
<PB N="5" REF="001592_0009_0FB3D96293D28DF0">
to the Apostolical prudence, which we read of, <HI>Acts</HI> 15.16.3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.19, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And which the Nation soon felt the happy Effects of, when by this ex|cellent Conduct it became, generally speaking, Reformed. But yet after all, so little was taken out of the Mass Book, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that they differ'd more than they agreed in, and more was left than taken out.</P>
<P>But our Author stays not here, <HI>That the</HI> English <HI>Liturgy,</HI> saith he, <HI>is ori|ginally Heathenish as well as Popish, is manifest,</HI> 1. <HI>In that the Pope's Liturgy from whence ours is deriv'd, is so. The principal Parts of the Mass-Book were borrowed from Idolatrous Pagans. They came from</HI> Numa Pompilius, <HI>p.</HI> 4. <HI>Ans.</HI> It has been sufficiently made out by Protestants, that there is a great Affinity and Agreement between the Heathenish and Pop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh Rites; but our Author does an injury to the Argument, when affirming, that the <HI>Principal Parts</HI> of the Mass-Book were borrowed from Idolatrous Pagans, he goes no further than <HI>Vestments, Holy Water, and Incense,</HI> as if these were the <HI>principal Parts</HI> of the Mass-Book, and the chief things that that agreed in with the Idolatry of the Heathens.</P>
<P>But this indeed is not to our purpose; suppose there be this Confor|mity between the Papist and the Pagan; what is that to us, if we agree with neither? But that he attempts to prove.</P>
<P>But tho' he cannot find <HI>Incense</HI> and <HI>Holy Water,</HI> and his <HI>Et caetera</HI> among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, yet he saith, <HI>What vain Repetitions does the Common Prayer Book abound with? In one Service the Worshippers must repeat these words,</HI> Good Lord de|liver us, <HI>Eight times over. And,</HI> We beseech thee to hear us, <HI>Twenty times over. The</HI> Gloria Patri <HI>is to be repeated Ten times in the same Morning or Evening Service. That the Heathens were wont to Worship their Idols just after the same manner, is clear from</HI> Matth. 7. &amp;c. <HI>And</HI> Beza <HI>notes, That the</HI> Roman <HI>Liturgy does abound with them, wherein Men are taught to cry,</HI> Jesu, Jesu, miserere mei, <HI>no less then Ten times one after another.</HI></P>
<P>For the better Resolution of which, I shall proceed in this order.</P>
<P N="1">1. We grant, that there may be such things as vain Repetitions in Pray|ers, and other Divine Offices, for that is a fault our Saviour charges on the Heathens; and what we, as well as our Author, charge on the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and is also frequently charged by those that use and plead for Forms, on those that use extemporary Prayers.</P>
<P N="2">2. We yet do maintain, That there are such Repetitions in Divine Worship, as are not vain, that are neither Heathenish or Popish. Such do we read of in the <HI>Old Testament</HI> as <HI>Psalm</HI> 57.1.75.1, 4, 5&punc; 94&punc; 1.103.1, 2, 22.107 8, 15, 21, 31.136 <HI>throughout.</HI> And thus our Saviour repeated the same words thrice in his Agony in the Garden, <HI>Matt.</HI> 26.44&punc; and twice
<PB N="6" REF="001592_0010_0FB3D9641314B078">
on the Cross, <HI>Matt</HI> 27 46. And consequently all Repetitions are no more condemned by our Saviour in <HI>Matt.</HI> 6.7. than all long Prayers are, <HI>Matt.</HI> 23.14. So that the vanity of Repetitions does not consist in using the same words eight times or twenty times in Prayer. For do we repeat in our Service, <HI>Good Lord deliver us,</HI> eight times: And <HI>Glory be to the Father,</HI> &amp;c. ten times? And, <HI>We beseech thee to hear us, good Lord,</HI> twenty times? So we find, that they not only had their thrice, and their four times, but their twenty seven times in every Verse of <HI>Psalm</HI> 136. <HI>His mercy endureth for ever</HI>; which <HI>Psalm</HI> was most used on solemn Occasions, as we may find it, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 5.13.7.3, 6 20, 21. <HI>Ezra</HI> 3.11. <HI>Ior.</HI> 33.11. So that we may more truly say of the Church of God among the <HI>Iews,</HI> than he doth of the <HI>Heathens,</HI> and their Idols, that <HI>they were wont to Worship</HI> God <HI>just after the same manner,</HI> with Repetitions in their Service, as we.</P>
<P N="3">3. We are to consider wherein the vanity of Repetitions consists, so as to be after the manner of the Heathens. This admits great variety, and just bounds cannot be set; so that it's not to be exactly said, Here the vain Repetitions begin. But they are such;</P>
<P N="1">1. When they that use them, think that they shall be <HI>heard for their much speaking,</HI> as our Saviour saith, the Heathens did: Thus the Priests of <HI>Baal</HI> did, crying out, <HI>O Baal hear us,</HI> from Morning till Noon; and ac|cordingly <HI>Elijah</HI> upbraids them. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 18.26, 27.</P>
<P N="2">2. When it is nothing but Tautology, <HI>viz.</HI> a Repetition of the same words without new Matter; or of the same matter, but in different words. Such were the Verses of <HI>Battus</HI> the babling Poet. Such were the Hymns used often by the Heathens, in the worship of their gods. Such are the <HI>Iesu, Iesu&punc; &amp;c.</HI> without Intermission, sometimes used in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church.</P>
<P>But when there are distinct Petitions, as when we say, <HI>We beseech thee to hear us good Lord,</HI> it's as lawful to close each after that manner, as it is to say <HI>Amen,</HI> which we find to follow every particular Petition, and was distinctly repeated for twelve times together after that manner, <HI>Deut.</HI> 27.15.</P>
<P N="3">3. Vain Repetitions, are when the words are thought sufficient, tho' the Heart be not with them; but this may be common to any. So that tho' there are Repetitions in our Service, as there were among the Heathen, and are in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet ours are not vain, nor such Repetitions as theirs, by reason of the matter only, if accompanied with the heart.</P>
<P N="3">3 He saith, <HI>Some of the most Learned Patrons of Liturgies produce it as an Argument for them, that the Heathen made use of Forms in their Idolatrous Wor|ship</HI> p 5 And so he makes this the difference between the Heathens and Christians, that the first used Forms, but the last prayed without them. As for the practice of the Christians, we shall have occasion to speak of
<PB N="7" REF="001592_0011_0FB3D96593376348">
it under another Head; neither shall I trouble my self with the Opinion of those <HI>Learned Patrons of Liturgies,</HI> he speaks of: But I shall take his Argument as it lies before us, which is, That our Liturgy is Heathenish, because we use Forms a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they did. He might as well have said, our Litur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gy is Heathenish, because we use words as they did, since it's no more Heathenish to use Forms than Words. If they had the use of Forms, it rather shews the sense that Mankind generally have of this matter; and that there cannot be too great a care taken of our demeanour in Divine Worship, according to the Direction of the Wise man, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 5 2 <HI>Be not rash with thy mouth</HI> &amp;c. <HI>for God is in heaven,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>therefore let thy words be few,</HI> and well considered. But if the Heathens had Forms, so had the <HI>Iews,</HI> so had Christians, as I shall shew; and so Forms no more make our Worship Heathenish than Jewish. But of this afterwards. But supposing, that our Liturgy was (as he would have it) taken out of the Mass-Book&punc; yet,</P>
<P>Q 2. Will the being taken out of the Mass-Book, make that Worship which is otherwise, good and lawful, to become unlawful to be used, or joyned with?</P>
<P>This he affirms, and offers to prove after this manner,</P>
<P><HI>It's a known maxim,</HI> (saith he) Omnis honor Idoli est Idolatria. <HI>He that shall put any respect upon an Idol, cannot be clear of the Sin of Idolatry; but the Mass Book is an Idol. And he that useth a Prayer, or joyns with a Prayer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aken out of that Book, thereby put<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an Honour upon an Idol. &mdash; How then can we joyn in Prayer taken out of the Idolatrous Mass-Book, and offer them to the Holy God?</HI></P>
<P>In which there are there Three things contained.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Mass-Book is an Idol.</P>
<P N="2">2. That to take a Prayer out of the Mass-Book is a respect to an Idol&punc; and is Idolatry</P>
<P N="3">3 That it's unlawful to joyn in Prayers taken out of the Mass-Book</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Mass Book is an Idol</HI> This we may justly question, because an Idol is the Representation of some Divine or Beatified Obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct, and that is as such propounded and set up for Adoration; such are the Images of God and our Saviour, of Angels and Saints in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> But in this sense the Mass Book is no Idol, there is no Prototype or Obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct it repre|sents, nor is any such Adoration paid to it, as is paid to an Image, or a Crucifix We grant as well as he, that the Mass Book is <HI>Idolatrous,</HI> as it contains some things that are so, and is used in Idolatrous Worship: But it no more follows from thence, that it is an Idol, than that the Incense, Holy Water, or Vestments, are Idols, which are used when they say Mass.
<PB N="8" REF="001592_0012_0FB3D9676CEF1128">
But supposing the Mass-Book for once to be an Idol, that we may pro|ceed to the next question, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Whether the taking a Prayer out of the Mass Book, be such a respect to it, as makes the Prayer to be Idolatrous? To this I answer, That the Prayers taken out of the Mass Book, and inserted in our Liturgy, are so far from being a respect, that it is a disrespect to it. For at the same time that some Prayers were taken out, those were rejected that were left behind, for the gross Corruptions that were in them; and by so doing, the Reforme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> as much testified to all the World their abhorrence of it, as the emptying of the House of the Goods and Utensils not infected by the Leprosy, and their forsaking it, was a plain declaration of its Pollution. So that if Prayers taken from thence are good, the using them when taken thence, is no Idolatry, and Communion in them no Sin, and no more un|lawful than it was to use the Vessels that were carried out of the in|fected House.</P>
<P>But this is the main Question, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Q Whether that which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> been used in Idolatrous Worship, may, if otherwise good and lawf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e used where the Worship is not Idolatrous?</P>
<P>This he denies, and for it offers these Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We ought not to name an Idol, but with detestation; much less may we offer it as Worship to God,</HI> Psal. 16 4. Exod. 23.13. <HI>Hos</HI> 2.16, 17 P. 4.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>It was</HI> Paul's <HI>Iudgment, that Meat once offer'd to Idols, should not be made use of,</HI> 1 Cor. 10.28 <HI>Therefore a Service-Book offer'd to Idols ought not to be used. For there is a parity of Reason.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>God hath strictly prohibited his people all symbolizing with the Heathen in civil usages, because he would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them imitate the Heathen,</HI> Levit. 19.19, 27.&mdash;<HI>especially in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to the Worship of God. Hence they were prohibited g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing up by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to the Altar,</HI> Exod. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0 24 26 <HI>to plant a Grove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> Deut. 16 31. <HI>And to Worship to the East.</HI> Ezek 8.16</P>
<P>Before I proceed to consider these Arguments in particular, I shall state the Case it self; for resolving of which we may observe.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there are things Idolatrous in their own nature, or by a stand|ing positive Law, and so are always the same. Such is the Picture of God, and Worshipping by Images.</P>
<P N="2">2. There are things that have been customarily appropriated to Idola|trous Worship, and the use of which in common estimation has been accounted Idolatrous Such was the offering Incense among the <HI>Heathens</HI>; and therefore the Primitive Christians refused it, as an acknowledgment of their Worship, and the <HI>Thurificati</HI> were reputed Idolaters.</P>
<P N="3">3&punc; There are other things that are used as well in true as Idolatrous
<PB N="9" REF="001592_0013_0FB3D968972E24A0">
Worship, and are lawful in themselves; such as Time, Place, Habit, Posture.</P>
<P>The first is always unlawful, and makes the Worship Idolatrous.</P>
<P>The second is not to be used where it has been thus appropriated, and thus accounted, during such an opinion of them.</P>
<P>So that it's the last of these that the whole turns upon; for after all the clamour he makes about Idolatry, and the charge he would fain fasten up|on us, he can produce nothing that is Idolatrous amongst us, no Images, no Prayers to Saints, nor so much as any thing appropriated, or in com|mon estimation so accounted; no incensing of Books or Images, no sprink|lings of Holy Water; but it all amounts to this, that <HI>Forms</HI> and <HI>Repetitions</HI> have been us'd by Idolaters; that they had <HI>White Garments,</HI> and observ'd <HI>Holy days</HI>; So <HI>p</HI> 4 5&punc; 8 Which are things lawful in themselves (as I shall shew) and cannot be made unlawful by being us'd in Idolatrous Worship. For whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Idolatry is not in the nature of the thing, but in the use, take away the use, and the Idolatry ceaseth; and consequently it may be law|fully used where there is no Idolatry in the Worship, and no Idolatry in the use of it. And if it be not to be used, it's not because it's unlawful in it self to use it, but because it's forbidden by God, as was the case a|mong the <HI>Iews</HI>; or because of some circumstances that make it inconveni|ent and dangerous. Thus it was lawful to eat that Meat, which had been offer'd to Idols, when it was afterward expos'd to sale in the Shambles, or set upon the Table at an Entertainment;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.25, 26.</NOTE> because it was thereby restor'd to a common use; when yet it was not lawful to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t at Meat in an Idols Temple, for that was to have fellowship in the Idolatry, <HI>Chap.</HI> 8.10, 20. It is then no more Idolatry to use a White Garment, or a Temple, or observe a Day, or to use a Prayer that has been used or observ'd in Idolatrous Worship&punc; or by an Idolatrous Church, than it was to eat Meat that had been offer'd to Idols. Purifie the Gold, and separate the Dross from it, and the Gold is not the worse for the Dross that was before mingled with it. Scrape the Walls, and cast out the infected materials of it, so that the House be freed from the Le|prosie, and it might have been as well inhabited as if it had never been infected, <HI>Numb.</HI> 14.41 (to make use of former Comparisons, <HI>p.</HI> 2<HI>d</HI> and 3<HI>d</HI>) and take the things lawful from the things unlawful, and they become lawful again, and may be lawfully used.</P>
<P>But saith he <HI>The Rubbish of the Leprous house was to be cast into an unclean place: And the Leprosie breaks out still; therefore we may have no communion with it</HI> p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>But surely it's the same thing if we leave the House that is infected, as
<PB N="10" REF="001592_0014_0FB3D96A1516BA38">
it is to carry away the Rubbish into an unclean place; else why doth he talk of leaving the Communion for the sake of the Leprosie of Idolatry? We grant the Church we left to be Idolatrous, there the Leprosie is; and therefore we left it; but we left the Idolatry with the Church, and let him prove there is any of the Leprosie of Idolatry in what we have taken out of it, and then he would say somewhat to the purpose; but that he is far from.</P>
<P>Let us however consider his Arguments relating to the general part. 1. We ought, saith he, not to name an Idol, but with detestation, much less offer it as worship to God.</P>
<P>I answer, 1<HI>st.</HI> The <HI>naming</HI> there forbidden, is the naming an Idol with respect; and indeed the addressing any Worship to it. So <HI>Psal.</HI> 16.4. <HI>Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another God; their drink-offering of blood will I no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> offer, nor take up their name into my lips</HI>: That is, they might not name them by way of worship, nor offer Sacrifice to them.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d</HI> Where is there such a naming of an Idol amongst us? what respect do we give to his Idol the <HI>Mass Book</HI>? what Saint do we adore? <HI>But,</HI> saith he, <HI>The Prayers are taken out of the Idolatrous</HI> Mass-Book. But what then, if there be nothing of their Idolatry in the Prayers that are taken thence they are no more Idolatrous than before they were taken into the <HI>Mass Book.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d</HI> He saith, <HI>It was</HI> Paul<HI>'s Iudgment&punc; that meat once offer'd to Idols should not be made use of,</HI> 1 Cor 10 28 <HI>Therefore a Service-Book offer'd to Idols ought not to be us'd. For there is a parity of Reason.</HI></P>
<P>I conceive he is much mistaken in the account he gives of the Apostle's <HI>Iudgment,</HI> who is so far from maintaining <HI>meat offer'd to Idols to be unlawful,</HI> that he makes it a thing indifferent (as before); and what a person may with a safe conscience eat of without scruple, unless it be with respect to another's conscience that is thereby offended, as the Apostle determines it, <HI>v.</HI> 28 29 Now if Meat offered to Idols might be eaten of, then a Ser|vice-Book that has been used in Idolatrous Worship may be lawfully us'd (when the things contain'd in it are otherwise lawful and good.) <HI>For there is a parity of Reason,</HI> as he argues.</P>
<P N="3">3 He saith <HI>God hath prohibited his people all symbolizing with Heathen,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>We grant that God did prohibit the <HI>Iews</HI> all symbolizing and agreement with the <HI>Heathens</HI> in their Idolatry. That is not the Question But,</P>
<P N="1">1 Whether an agreement with Idolaters in what was once used by them in Idolatry, becomes Idolatry, or be unlawful because it has been so used?</P>
<P N="2">2. Or whether what was forbidden to the <HI>Iews</HI> is forbidden to all peo|ple, and to Christians as well as they?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="001592_0015_0FB3D96B954B04F0">These we deny.</P>
<P>The first we deny as to the <HI>Iews,</HI> that every thing us'd in Idolatrous Service was unlawful to them; for he says, <HI>The Priest of</HI> Isis <HI>used to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Linnen Surplices,</HI> p 9 and yet such Linnen Garments were the Priests and <HI>Levites</HI> to officiate in. So Circumcision was used among the <HI>Egyptians&punc; &amp;c.</HI> and yet continu'd to be used among the <HI>Iews.</HI></P>
<P>Again, we deny that what was in that kind forbidden to the <HI>Iews,</HI> was forbidden and unlawful to all. For,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> A great part of what they were forbidden, was with respect to the people that before Inhabited the Land; with whom they were to make no Covenant, but were utterly to destroy them, their Altars and Groves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Exod. 23.32, 33, 34.12 Deut. 7 2, 3, 5.</P>
<P N="2">2. They were a people very prone to Idolatry, and so were tied up by strict Restrai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s and Penaltier.</P>
<P N="3">3. They both came from <HI>Egypt,</HI> where they had long convers'd with Idolatrous Service, and afterwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d border'd upon Nations violently ad|dicted to Idolatry and Sorcery; and in such circumstances there were these Checks laid upon them; and an assimilation to the Customs of such forbidden.</P>
<P>And all this was not from the nature of the thing, and because all usages of Idolaters were unlawful, but because of the circumstances of people, time, and place: And if so, then we must leave the case of symbolizing, and no longer make it a Case of Conscience, but of prudence and expediency; and so we are left to judge what is fit to be retained, and what not; what practised, and what not.</P>
<P>And here our Reformers shew'd their Prudence and Moderation, by what they chose; when the Ceremonies were few; and what were the Ceremonies of the Protestant Church, rather than the <HI>Romish.</HI> When they chose some, that they might not give offence to the Churches of Christ in other parts of the World; and yet retain'd no more, that they might not burthen their own Communion. When the Offices they selected were agreeable to the Ancientest Offices of the Church.</P>
<P>So that there was no Reformation in any place, where so much temper was preserv'd, and where the purity of Religion, and the sin|cerity and solemnity of Divine Service were more regarded: that what was good was retained; what was noxious was purg'd out, and even what was superfluous was exscinded.</P>
<P>But this he will not allow.</P>
<P><HI>For,</HI> saith he, <HI>the use of such a Liturgy doth harden the Papists in their
<PB N="12" REF="001592_0016_0FB3D96D144B7AF8">
Idolatry,</HI> p. 4. So <HI>the Liturgy came from</HI> Rome, <HI>and will perhaps lead thi|ther again.</HI> p&punc; 18.</P>
<P>But 1. How can such a Liturgy <HI>harden</HI> them in their Idolatry, or <HI>lead</HI> thither, which has none of their Idolary in it; and in which the Papists are expresly charged with Idolatry? <HI>Vid.</HI> Rubrick at the Communion.</P>
<P N="2">2 How can this harden them or lead thither, which has been the means of banishing and keeping their Idolatry out of the Kingdom?</P>
<P N="3">3 How can this <HI>harden</HI> them, or <HI>lead</HI> thither, when the Papists agree with our Author, <HI>That it's unlawful to be present at, or partake in the Com|mon Prayer Worship,</HI> and are excommunicated if they do?</P>
<P N="4">4. How can this harden them, or lead thither, when there is nothing that the Papists more labour to prossess the people with prejudices against?</P>
<P>But he adds, <HI>p.</HI> 4. <HI>The</HI> Jews <HI>themselves are scandalized by the Liturgy. It's a celebrated Saying among them, That the Christians have their</HI> Jephilleth <HI>from</HI> Armillus; <HI>that is, their Prayer-Books from</HI> Antichrist.</P>
<P>At what are the <HI>Iews</HI> scandalized? Is it that we have a Liturgy? So have they themselves had of latter Ages at least. And so the Author saith, <HI>p.</HI> 13. That he had <HI>seen Liturgies written in the</HI> Hebrew <HI>Tongue.</HI></P>
<P>Is it that we receive our <HI>Prayer Book</HI> from <HI>Antichrist</HI>? Yes, saith he, and for this quotes a <HI>Celebrated Saying</HI> of theirs. But is this the truer for their saying so? They say, it seems, that <HI>Christians have receiv'd their</HI> Prayers <HI>from</HI> Antichrist: But I hope that there are many Christians in the World, that have Prayer-Books which they never received from the <HI>Antichrist</HI> he speaks of; So the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Abyssins,</HI> &amp;c. The whole is at least a sorry Mistake, and which, for ought I see, he understands no more than we do his <HI>Iephilleth.</HI> The case is plainly thus; That the Rabbins say, that <HI>Ar|millus</HI> was to be a person of prodigious form, begot of a Marble Statue in <HI>Rome,</HI> and was to be the last Enemy of the <HI>Iews,</HI> and the Leader of the Christian Forces against them; that he should kill Messias <HI>Ben Ephraim,</HI> and at last be killed by Messias <HI>Ben David.</HI> That he should give <HI>Iephilleth,</HI> and a Law to the Christians, which he and they set up in opposition to the Law of <HI>Moses.</HI> So that we see that his <HI>Tephillell</HI> is the Law as well as the Prayers of Christians; and they make <HI>Armillus</HI> to be toward the end of the World, the last Enemy of the <HI>Iews</HI>; and how could our Li|turgy, or the Liturgies now used by Christians, be the Prayers received from <HI>Armillus,</HI> when <HI>Armillus</HI> is yet to come, according to the Rabinical Notion?

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the <HI>Matter</HI> of the <HI>Common-Prayer</HI>-Book&punc;</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I proceed to the particular consideration of his Objections relating to this Head; let me observe, that if we should grant what he finds fault with to be blame-worthy; yet it's no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pose, and the point he proposed; which is to give <HI>Reasons why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e judges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> unlawful to be present at, or partake in the</HI> Common-Prayer <HI>Worship.</HI></P>
<P>And that for these R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">asons. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. There may be many things that are a reason against Ministerial Con|formity, which will not be a reason against communion with the Church&punc; since there are those things required to the one, that are not required to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> other. Such is the Surplice, the Office for burying the Dead, Marrying, <HI>p&punc;</HI> 8, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which belong to the Minist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, and not to the People: And there+fore tho' it should be unlawful to wear a Surplice, or use these Offices, yet since Lay-Communion is not concern'd in them, they are no reason for separation.</P>
<P N="2">2 Many of his Obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctions are only directed against the occasional Offi|ces, and so can be no reason against constant communion in the Daily Office, or in those Offices in which they do not occur. As supposing what he alledgeth out of the Office of Burial, Marriage, Baptism, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be true and sufficient, yet tho' they may be a reason against being present at the Offic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of Burial, Baptism, and Marriage, they are no reason against Communion, where those Offices are not concerned.</P>
<P N="3">3&punc; Things inconvenient&punc; if not unlawful, are no reason for a separation, because then there could be no Communion with any Church, since no Church is without them: And if we should grant the reading a worse Translation of Scripture, and the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> in the Church, to be things of that nature; yet it will be hard to shew them to be unlawful in themselves, and so to make it necessary to withdraw from the Church where they are used.</P>
<P>If these things be consider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, most of what he has said will be preve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted; but that I may not seem to avoid any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing, I shall take notice of the Par|ticulars as they lie in order.

But I think there is a good account to be given of the sense of this Version; and that is, Ere that the Pots are made hot with the Thorns&punc; they shall be severely pun|ished: The being made hot with the Thorns, sets forth the suddenness; and the phrase, <HI>vexing a thing that is raw,</HI> denotes the severity of it.</P>
<P N="2">(2) His next Instance of <HI>things extremely ridiculous,</HI> is, that <HI>in the Liturgy, the Writings of the Prophets, Acts and Revelations, are called Epistles.</HI> If these were formerly, they are not now so called; but of these when read in the place of Epistles, it's said, <HI>The portion of Scripture for the Epistle.</HI> That is, the Sections of Scripture read in that order, are generally Epistles; and so, as it's usual in other cases, gives the name to all: And as it is not now, so never was it called the Epistle of the Prophets, Acts, or Revelations; but the Epistle taken out of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

But he dust not press that too far; for if he had, it would have fallen hard upon such as never have the Scriptures read in their Congregations, tho' that was a solemn part of Divine Worship in the Churches of God, as the Scripture informs us, <HI>Acts</HI> 15.21, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> is so deservedly blamed for reading the Scriptures in an unknown tongue, what do they not deserve that never read them at all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n their Congregations? Surely if they had, according to our Saviour's advice, considered the Beam in their own eye, they would not have thus magnified the Mote in their Brother's eye. I re|member a Question in a Book of the same kind with our Au|thor's,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Survey of the Book of Common-Prayer</HI>; An. 1610. <HI>p.</HI> 26.</NOTE> <HI>Whether</HI> Protestants <HI>do not sin in defrauding the people of some Books and Chapters of Scripture, as well as</HI> Papists <HI>in defrauding them of all.</HI> And then what sort of Protestants are they, that with the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> defraud the people of all, so far as the Publick Service of God is concern'd?</P>
<P>But to return: Before I shall consider his few Instances, that he would make good this Bloody Charge by, I shall premise a few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Instances he offers are, at the worst, Mistranslations, Slips, and Errors, and not chargeable with perverseness, according to what we charge upon the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> For here is no interest to be served: For what is our Church concern'd, whether it be read as the Liturgical Translation has it, <HI>the</HI> 7<HI>th. Day</HI>; or as the Common Translation, <HI>The Sab|bath</HI>; whether as that, <HI>they were not obedient to his word</HI>; or as this, <HI>they rebelled not against his word</HI>; whether as that, <HI>The rod of the wicked cometh not into the lot of the righteous</HI>; or as this, <HI>resteth not</HI>: Whether as in that, the Titles of some Psalms and Hallelujahs are omitted; or as in this, they are inserted. Surely here is no interest visible in this, that should incline our Translators of the Psalter to pick out these Texts above all others to make bold with.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mistranslations and Errors of this kind, are no sufficient reason for not using such a Translation, and much less for separating from a Church where they are used; for then no Translation could be us'd, or no Church communicated with, because no Church is without such Translations&punc; and no Translation without such Errors. Thus it was in the Church of the
<PB N="16" REF="001592_0020_0FB3D973158C1148">
<HI>Iews,</HI> when the Septuagint was used in publick; Which doth often alter and add to the original <HI>Hebrew</HI>; and yet was not only used, but is quoted by the Divine Writers, even in many places where those Alterations and Additions are. So it alters, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10 5.11.21. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10 18. <HI>Act.</HI> 7.8. It adds, as <HI>Luk</HI> 3.36, 37. <HI>Acts</HI> 7 14.</P>
<P>Then also must not our common Translation be used, which besides the mistakes allowed to be in it, does add in many places, and particularly half a Verse, 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 2.23. So it adds the Dates and Subscriptions to the E|pistles, Chapters, Verses, and Arguments, throughout the whole, <HI>as if Canonical.</HI> And of this kind are all his Instances.</P>
<P>As (1.) He saith, <HI>The Common-Prayer Book violates the word of God, as sometimes the words of Scripture are obliterated, and others put in their room. Thus in the Catechism they have changed those words in the Fourth Command|ment, The Lord blessed the Sabbath day, into the Seventh day.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We grant it is so; but it's to be remembred, that it's not so in the 20<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h of <HI>Exodus,</HI> but in the Liturgy; and if the Liturgy differs from <HI>Exodus,</HI> it's a difference without a distinction, since the Seventh day and Sabbath are all one; and if it differs from <HI>Exodus,</HI> it agrees with the first institu|tion, <HI>Gen</HI> 2 3. where it's said, <HI>God rested on the seventh day, and God blessed the seventh day, and Sanctified it.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) He saith, <HI>Sometimes the Liturgy makes bold directly and in terms to con|tradict the Scripture; so</HI> Psalm 105.28. <HI>it's said they were not rebellious, but the Common-Prayer-Book saith, they were not obedient; and so</HI> Psal. 125, 3.</P>
<P>We grant that there is a seeming contradiction in words, but not in the meaning of it; for the relative <HI>they</HI> being undetermined, and indifferent|ly to be applyed to <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> or to the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> accordingly is this place to be interpreted; if understood of the former, it's to be read in the Common Translation, <HI>they were not rebellious</HI>; if of the latter, it's to be read in the Translation of the Liturgy, <HI>they were not obedient.</HI> And this last reading is according to the present reading of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ptuagint, and some other Translations that follow that. And yet that Translation was gene|rally used by the Primitive Christians, and was worse than any ever used by us. As for Psal. 125 3. <HI>The rod of the wicked shall not come,</HI> &amp;c. that is, so as to rest there, and so as to tempt them beyond what they are able.</P>
<P N="3">(3) He saith, <HI>Sometimes the Common Prayer Book adds to the Scripture; there are three whole Verses added to the</HI> 14<HI>th Psalm. And the</HI> Gloria Patri <HI>is frequently added to Scriptures, as if it were Canonical.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> When he saith, That <HI>it is a dreadful thing to add to the word of God,</HI> and charges our Church with it, we might expect some very crimi|nal instances to make it good, and when he saith three whole Verses are

added, one would think that this was somewhat invented, and herein inser|ted by the Church upon some wicked selfish design. But 1. tho we allow that such Verses are added, yet it's not an addition to Scripture; for tho not found in this place, yet they are in another, <HI>viz. R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m</HI> 3 13. and quo|ted by the Apostle from other Psalms. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2&punc; It's not the Common-Prayer Book that adds, but the Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n which the Common-Prayer followeth, <HI>viz</HI> the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uagint and Vulgar; and tho it was a mistake, yet it's far from being such as incurs the penalty of <HI>Deut.</HI> 4.2. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ria Patri</HI>&punc; I deny that it's added to the Scriptures <HI>as Cano|nical,</HI> any more then the Contents of the Chapters, the Chapters and Ver|ses of the Bible, or the Dates of the Epistles are; nay, I deny that it's added at all; for any one that can read, will see that it's not inserted in the Psalter, but only rehearsed as the Rubrick directs. And it was for a good end that this was anciently used in the Orthodox Churches of old, and is continued in ours, <HI>viz.</HI> in opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sition to the <HI>Arians,</HI> and <HI>Anti-Trini|tarians S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zom l.</HI> 26</P>
<P N="4">(4) He saith, <HI>Sometimes words are Sacrilegiously stolen out of the Bible As the last Verse is omitted,</HI> Psal 72 <HI>So are the Scriptural Titles of many Psalms. And I know not how often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hose words,</HI> Praise ye the Lord, <HI>are left out</HI>&punc;</P>
<P>He durst not trust his Reader with the things left out, for they would have appear'd of so little Cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quence, as would have betrayed the weak|ness of his Cause as well as his own spite&punc; That verse omitted, Psal. 72. is this, <HI>The Prayers of David the Son of Iesse, are ended.</HI> The Titles of the <HI>Psalms</HI> are for the most part such as are no key to the matter of them, and without which the Psalms are as intire as the Chapters without the Con|tents: The Clause, <HI>praise ye the Lord,</HI> is in the <HI>Hebrew, Hallelujah,</HI> and is on|ly left out when it's independent, and has no immediate Relation to the preceeding or following Verse. And the reason of these Omissions seems to be, Because the Psalms being to be read in parts, according to the ancient Custom in <HI>Chrysostom</HI>'s time and before, or chanted, and so read on without naming the Psalm, the Titles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would have made a break in that order. And this was done after the manner of Singing the Psalms in the Temple-Service, in which the Titles, and the passage, <HI>the Prayer of David the Son of Iesse, are ended,</HI> were to be sure no part. And so it is in the Singing Psalms, used by the Dissenters as well as us&punc; And who may as well be charged with such Omissions as we, who there for the reason abovesaid, use neither the Verse nor Titles.

only in the ordinary Service in the publick, where they themselves read it not at all; and when upon the like way of arguing, we may charge them with laying aside the whole Scripture, out of which they read not one Chapter for the Information of the People. He goes on.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>In the Liturgy the Apocrypha Books are made equal with, nay advanced above the Holy Scripture.</HI> Strange? that a Church should be guilty of this, that in their Articles exclude them out of the Canon; and saith, That they are not read to confirm any Doctrine, but only for in|forming the Manners. But let us see how he proves this, not by any Assertion of the Church, but some stretches of Arguing. As,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) They are made equal. For <HI>in the Preface to the Common Prayer, it's said, Nothing ordained is to be read but the pure word of God, or that which is evidently grounded on the same. But is the Apocrypha so?</HI></P>
<P>Here for improving this Augument, he alters the words of the Pre|face; and for that which is in that, <HI>agreeable to the same,</HI> he reads <HI>evi|dently grounded on the same,</HI> and then triumphs, <HI>Is the Apocrypha so</HI>? But take it how he will, it's evident from hence, that the Apocrypha is so far from being made equal with Scripture, that there is a plain difference between them; for that to which a thing is agreeable, and on which it's grounded, is above that which is agreeable to it, and grounded upon it. A Plea grounded on the Law, is surely of less Authority than the Law on which it is grounded. The Apocrypha being read, not for establishing any Doctrine, but for informing the Manners; there is nothing in what is appointed of that kind to be read, but what is agreeable to the word of God, and not contrary to it; and so may be read, as well as their Sermons be heard, which can pretend to no more.</P>
<P N="2">(2) He saith, <HI>The Liturgy appoints the Apocrapha to be read as Lessons, just as I find it in the Pope's Service-Book, and in a great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> proportion than Scripture; for (as some have observ'd) of</HI> 172 <HI>Apocryph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Chapters, but</HI> 38 <HI>are omitted, So that these Books are equalized with the pure word of God.</HI></P>
<P>But surely he doth not <HI>find</HI> in our Service-Book, that the Apocry|pha Lessons are read for Canonical Scripture, and declared to be so, as they are in the <HI>Pope's Service Book</HI>; but only as Apocrypha. He that will look for the Apocrypha Books in the Pope's Bible, as well as Service-Book, will find them mixed with the Canonical, as <HI>Hester</HI> and <HI>Esdra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> &amp;c. but he that will find them in our Bibles, will find them by themselves, and <HI>Apocryphal</HI> in the head of them.</P>
<P>If, as he affirms, the Apocrypha is read in a <HI>greater proportion</HI> than Scripture, it doth more than equalize, and doth rather advance it a|bove
<PB N="19" REF="001592_0023_0FB3D97796056F98">
the Scripture, and so belongs to his next Assertion, which he would have done well to have reserved it to, to made up the proof he is there wanting in.</P>
<P>As for what he affirms, that the Apocrypha is read in greater pro|portion than the Scripture, nothing more false. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. All the Second Lessons throughout the Year, are out of the <HI>New-Testament.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 All Epistles and Gospels read on Sundays and Holy days, are wholly ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Canonical Scripture.</P>
<P N="3">3. All First L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssons on <HI>Sundays</HI> are out of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> and none out of the Apocrypha.</P>
<P N="4">4 On the 33 Holy-days on the Week days, there are but 26 Apocry|pha First Lessons, whereas there are 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> out of the Cononical Scripture.</P>
<P N="5">5. When the Apocrypha is appointed to be read in course, it's not clear two Months for First Lessons&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut the Holy Scripture is read all the other Ten Months&punc; and more</P>
<P N="6">6. Of the 39 Books of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> but 3 are entirely omitted, <HI>viz. Chronicles</HI> and <HI>Canticles</HI>; but of the 13 of the Apocrypha, 6 are not read at all.</P>
<P N="7">7. Of the 929 Chapters of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> 753 are read in course, and 176 only omitted (the reasons for which generally will appear to the Reader) but out of the 272 Chapters of the Apocrypha, there are (not as he saith 38) 66 omitted, and among them that of <HI>Tobit,</HI> that he obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts against. Where methinks he that pretends to have read and compar'd, should have had more value for his own understanding, than to be beholding to others, and to say, <HI>some have observed</HI>; for there is nothing li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a man's own observation in matter of Fact.</P>
<P N="3">(3) He saith, <HI>The Liturgy advanceth the Apocrypha above the Scripture, by intimating that they are more edifying, and can be less spared than many portions of the Holy Canon; and by ordering them to be read on the highest Holy-days, and many of them twice some th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice in one year.</HI></P>
<P>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thinks in such a round Charge as this, that <HI>the Liturgy advanceth the Apocrypha above Scripture,</HI> he should have had more than an <HI>intimation</HI> for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> evidence.

How then come the Feasts of <HI>Purim</HI> and <HI>Dedication</HI> the Places and Houses of Prayer?

they might not. They had not a liberty as we, because under a School-master, and of a Temper that needed it, and whose Service was Typical. And yet notwithstanding this, they had a liberty which they might use, and much more then we.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. What is that, if there be no Idolatry borrowed with it? Do we use it to sanctify Holy-water, Bells, <HI>&amp;c?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. As for his Quotation from Dr <HI>Abbot,</HI> it's a gross mistake, or some|what worse; all he saith is, That <HI>the Buyers and Sellers.</HI> Rev 13 6. <HI>are the Bishops, Priests, and Monks that expose to sale Masses and Indulgen|ces, &amp;c. that bind themselves by Oath to the Bishop of</HI> Rome, <HI>and in testimony of it, are divided from the rest of the Church by Rites, Vows&punc; Vnctions, Trea|sures Garments.</HI> Where he speaks of Garments in general, and no more of Surplices than Gowns; and of Garments they ordinarily wear, such as belong to Monastick Orders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But if he had spoke of all Garments that distinguish the Clergy from the Laity, Dr. <HI>Abbot</HI> had been in that a Fanatick, and not Dr. <HI>Abbot,</HI> who himself wore such Garments, and surely did not think by that, he had a <HI>special Character of the Beast</HI> upon him.</P>
<P>What he quotes from Bishop <HI>Iewel,</HI> is not in that place (if any where) he refers to; neither in the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Latin</HI> Volume.</P>

<P><PB N="24" REF="001592_0028_0FB3D97F1377EEB8">So little did these Learned Men think Mr. <HI>Nichol</HI>'s Argument of any force, which our Author proposes, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That all Vestments ap|propriated to the Worship of God, and appointed for the Significa|tion of Spiritual Duties, by the will of Man, are unlawful. But the Surplice is so.</Q>
And is, he saith, <HI>Not easy to be answer'd:</HI> but if it be to be answered, no matter whether it's not easy. From hence arise two Questions.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> 1. Whether it's unlawful to use any thing appropriated to the Wor|ship of God by the Will of Man?</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> 2. Whether it's unlawful to use any thing in the Worship of God that is appointed for the signification of Spiritual Duties by the Will of man?</P>
<P>By the first it's unlawful for men to appropriate places, or times, or postures to the Worship of God. And so it's necessary to avoid this Superstition, to make all the Meeting-places to be Houses of Merchan|dize, and to be equally divided between Religious and Common Uses. By the 2<HI>d.</HI> any thing that has such a Signification applied to it, is made unlawful, by vertue of such Signification, and which without such Signification would have been lawful. So a Surplice would have been a lawful Garment, if not appropriated, and without Signi|fication; and might have been in its self worn as well as a Cloak, since Custom and Use only makes the difference; but appropriate it, and clap a signification upon it, it's unlawful: And so a Cloak may be turn'd out of Service by the same way. So it's in posture, kneeling and standing are indefferent; but once appropriate kneeling to Prayer, and make it significative, and to be a posture of reverence, and it becomes unlawful. And so without end. So much for Mr. <HI>Nichol</HI>'s Argument, and its difficulty.</P>
<P N="7">7. Come we now to the Cross, <HI>the greatest Devil amongst all the Idols of</HI> Rome; as he tells us Mr. <HI>Parker sheweth.</HI></P>
<P>He saith 1. The first users of it were the Hereticks, <HI>Valentinus</HI> and <HI>Montanus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That seems hard, when those that wrote against them used it, as <HI>Orig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, Irenaeus, Turtullian,</HI> and <HI>Epiphanius,</HI> did against the former; and several others against the latter. We find it as ancient as <HI>Tertul|lian, Cyprian,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2 He saith, Mr. <HI>Parker proveth it a sin against all the Commandments, and a breach of the Letter of the second: for men to appoint a Religious Ce|remony, is a direct violation of the</HI> 2<HI>d Commandment, which forbids all hu|man Inventions in Divine Worship, as any part thereof.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="001592_0029_0FB3D980940C3F78"><HI>A.</HI> 1. There is a way of proving too much, and that any one that reads Mr. <HI>Parker</HI> will soon perceive he doth: And of this I take this Instance of the 2d Commandment to be one of the letter, of which the Author saith, the Cross is a breach. Now the Letter of the Command respects two things; 1. Nor to make any Graven Image for Religious Worship. 2. Not to bow down to any such Object. Now the Cross used in Baptism is an <HI>Aerial Cross,</HI> as he calls it; and where is the Object or the Worship? But our Author goes on to prove it after this manner; <HI>for men to appoint,</HI> &amp;c. Here we grant the Proposition to be true, because God only is to appoint his own Wor|ship; and so it's not in the power of man to appoint any part of it: But now if Religious Ceremonies may be, and yet not be part of Di|vine Worship, then they are no such human Inventions as are forbid|den; and no direct or indirect violation of the 2d Commandment. Therefore it remains upon him to prove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Cross a part of Divine Wor|ship</HI>: For we say it's only an adjunct, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no more a part of Wor|ship, than the striking the Blood upon the Door-posts was (to make use of <HI>Zepperus</HI> his Similitude) or sitting or kneeling at the Sacrament.</P>
<P N="3">3. He saith, <HI>The Arguments which are brought against the use of Oyl, Cream, Salt, Spittle in Baptism (practised by the</HI> Papists) <HI>hold as well a|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inst the Cross.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> This I deny; for the Scripture speaks honourably of the Cross of Christ, which this refers to, but not at all of the rest. Again, the Cross was traduced and reproached by the <HI>Heathens,</HI> which gave occasion to the use of it, and so were not the rest. So that this was used with reason; those without it.</P>
<P>His instance of the <HI>Gallows</HI> looks so prophanely, that I shall rather pass it by, than correct it.</P>
<P N="4">4 He saith, <HI>The</HI> Papists <HI>adore the Cross, and it's an Idol,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> But do they adore the <HI>Aerial Cross</HI>? But what is their Adora|tion (if it were) to us, that do not adore it?</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>This hath been testified against by</HI> Zege<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inus, Lepperus (it should be <HI>Zepperus) Goulartius,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The <HI>Lutheran</HI> Churches use it. See <HI>Hemingius,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Bucer</HI> ac|counts it <HI>neither indecent, nor unprofitable,</HI> but a Ceremony <HI>of much sim|plicity, and of present admonition of the Cross of Christ</HI>; Scripta Angl. cen|sur. <HI>c.</HI> 12. And generally they account it lawful, and not a suffici|ent reason for separation; but to be used, so it be without Supersti|tion. So <HI>Goulartius</HI> in <HI>Cypr. lib. ad. Demetr. c.</HI> 9.</P>
<P N="8">8. His last Instance of Superstition is, <HI>kneeling at the Sacrament.</HI> Let us consider what he has to say against it.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="26" REF="001592_0030_0FB3D982148094B8">1. He saith, <HI>Men pretend in it reverence to Christ; but Christ himself was personally present when his Disciples partook of the Lord's Supper; yet they did not kneel, but used the Table-gesture then customary among the</HI> Jews.</P>

<P N="2">2. The Question is not what they did, but what may lawfully be done and then the Question is, whether kneeling be unlawful?</P>
<P N="3">3. They themselves no more observe our Saviours Posture, than the <HI>Iews</HI> did that required at the first institution Our Author words it cauti|ously, when he saith the Disciples used the Table gesture <HI>then customary</HI>; for he well knew it was not sitting, but leaning, or lying along, and that they used this by way of signification.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the <HI>Table</HI> be the Rule to guide us, then to put on our Hats is suita|ble, as he knows who reasons.</P>
<P N="2">2 He saith, <HI>Good and wise men have chosen great sufferings, rather than com|ply with this Invention.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans</HI> And there were good and wise men that compiled the Liturgy, and used and enjoyned this posture; which is an argument he seeks to over|throw, <HI>p.</HI> 16 And as Good and wise men have allowed and approved it; and thought it by no means allowable to separate and break Communion for it. Such as <HI>P. Martyr, Zanchy, Beza Zepperus</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Bain, Noyes, Ames, Carwright,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>In primitive times Christians did not kneel in the participation of the Eucha|rist.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. It's certain they did not sit, for they had no Notion at all of a Table-gesture, as appears by the use of the Word Altar, and that they counted that a posture of irreverence.</P>
<P N="2">2 If they stood (as he saith) on the Lord's days, their standing was a posture of adoration, to be sure, when they received: So St. <HI>Cyril</HI> expresly, <HI>Catech</HI> 5</P>
<P N="3">3 It's prob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble that on other days, when not obliged to stand, that they kneeled; and since they received every day, on six Days they kneel'd.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Publick Liturgies of humane Composure are an innovation, and deviation from primitive Antiquity: <HI>And again,</HI> Set Forms of Prayer devised by men are an Innovation.</HEAD>
<P>FOR this he offers several Arguments.</P>
<P N="1">1 Saith he, <HI>Had a Liturgy been needful for the edification of the Church, undoubtedly Christ, or the Apostles by his direction, would have composed on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which none of them ever did. And therefore th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se men who take upon them to compose and impose a Liturgy on the Churches, assume to themselves more than A|postolical Power</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="001592_0032_0FB3D98513F6E2B8"><HI>Ans.</HI> I deny his consequence: For though our Saviour and his Apostles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> declared and left all things essential to a Church, yet there were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>needful to the edification of the Church</HI> in future Ages that were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> provided for. Our Saviour told the Apostles, that <HI>it should be gi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> to them in that hour what they should speak</HI>; and they spoke all Langua|ges by present infusion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> so were not obliged to think before, or study or learn a Language; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> was with relation to the present condition of the Church in those times. And there are no directions for after Ages to learn Languages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So there <HI>was a miraculous gift of Prayer in the Apostolical times</HI> (as St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> observes, <HI>Hom.</HI> 14 in <HI>Rom.</HI> 8) and no exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ess directions given about it, when that Gift should cease (as he saith it did) and when by the cessation of it, Forms would be necessary. Thus saith <HI>Capellus (Thes. Salmur.</HI> Part. 3. <HI>As soon as miraculous Gifts ceased, and Hereticks began to trouble the Church, there was a necessity for Liturgies.</HI> And therefore Mr. <HI>Ball</HI> saith, <HI>The Christian Churches</HI> for the space of this 1400 years at least, if not from the Apostles times, have had their stinted Liturgies. <HI>Triall,</HI> p 96, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So Letter of Min. of <HI>Old England, l</HI> 66, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But this our Author denies, and calls it an Innovation.</P>
<P>And saith, 2. <HI>The Liturgies father'd on the Apostles, and the ancient Writers</HI> (called Fathers) <HI>Learned men have evinced to be spurious.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> It's granted, that those father'd on the Apostles were so; but tho' not the Apostles, yet many of the Prayers in them were ancient, and the main of that call'd St. <HI>Iames</HI>'s, was used in the Church at <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Cumber</HI>'s [<HI>Original and Vse of Liturgies,</HI> p. 97] in Answer to <HI>Clarkson,</HI> has shew'd from <HI>Cyril.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 It's certain there was a Liturgy composed by St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> and <HI>Basil,</HI> and a great part of what is so call'd was certainly theirs; as the abovesaid Author has shew'd, <HI>p.</HI> 167, 172, 209. and of this mind were <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Mass l.</HI> 1. c. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Mornay</HI> and <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>Censur.</HI> 9.10. <HI>De cultu.

<P N="3">3. The least that can be observed from these Books, is, that when those Books were writ, the Liturgies were in use; so <HI>Daille</HI>;
<Q>We deny not but many of these Liturgies are ancient, and written about the beginning of the Ninth Century, tho' they were corrupted by Addition and Alte|rations at several times after their first original.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. He would prove from an obscure Passage in <HI>Iustin Martyr</HI> and <HI>Ter|tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lian,</HI> that there was <HI>no Book of Prayer used by Christians</HI> 200 years after Christ.</P>

<PB N="29" REF="001592_0033_0FB3D986941140B8">
add to, before he can work it to his purpose; for thus he translates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>according as strength and utterance was afforded to him from Heaven</HI>: Wherea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> word for word it is, <HI>in like manner be</HI> [the President] <HI>offered up Prayers to him</HI> [God] <HI>as he has power,</HI> that is, as fervently as he could: and so the same Phrase a little before.

<P N="4">4. He saith,
<Q>That there was no Liturgy in some Churches, or in general use in the Church, for above 400 years, is manifest from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ocrates</HI>; who saith, <HI>There were scarcely two Christians found who used the same words in Prayer,</HI> </Q>l. 5. c. 21.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Here he perverts again: For (1.) <HI>Socrates</HI> doth not say two Christians, but two Churches. (2.) He doth not say, they used the same <HI>words,</HI> but the same <HI>manner.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Words of <HI>Socrates</HI> do not infer what he would have; for he saith, <HI>In Summ among all Sects you shall scarcely find two Churches agreeing in the manner of Prayer</HI>: Which refers not to the Words, but the Ways, as before described, <HI>viz</HI> lighting up Candles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Supposing it was to be understood of the Words, what's that to Ex|tempore Prayer? for they may not have the same words, when yet they may have Forms. The Historian's meaning is, That the Churches had different Forms of Prayer, as well as different Rites: So <HI>Mornay</HI> speaking of the Liturgies of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Churches;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mas. <HI>l.</HI> 1. <HI>c</HI> 6.</NOTE> <HI>Tho in substance the Service of these Churches do agree, yet we must not think there was one and the same Prescript Form observed, and kept in them all.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. He saith, <HI>Some plead, that in the</HI> Jewish <HI>Church of old there were Forms of Prayer, besides those of Divine Inspiration</HI>; (but that was not;) and are all <HI>late composures.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. If there were Forms of old in the <HI>Iewish</HI> Church, of <HI>Divine Inspiration,</HI> and those Forms to be used (as the Scripture shews), then it shews that Forms may lawfully be used.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. They were so far from refusing Communion for them, that the Old <HI>Nonconformists ordinarily and constantly used the Common-Prayer-Book in their publick Ministrations</HI>; as Mr. <HI>Ball</HI> one of them, declares, <HI>Tryal,</HI> p 121, 155.</P>
<P N="4">4. All of them testified against the <HI>Brownists,</HI> and a separation from the Church. <HI>It was</HI> (saith Mr. <HI>Baxter) the Parish-Churches that had the Liturgy, which Mr.</HI> Jacob <HI>the Father of the Congregational Party wrote for communion with. The same I may say of Mr.</HI> Bradshaw, Dr. Ames, <HI>and other Nonconformists, whom the Congregational Brethren think more favour|able to their way.</HI></P>
<P>In the close, our Author offers some farther objections from <HI>the false and corrupt Doctrine</HI> he pretends to find in the Liturgy.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) As, that <HI>it's certain by God's word, that Children baptized dying before they commit actual sin, are undoubtedly saved. This,</HI> saith he, <HI>savours of</HI> Pelagianism.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="001592_0035_0FB3D989954B1878"><HI>Ans.</HI> I don't understand the falseness, or Pelagianism of it. It's certain by God's Word, that <HI>of such is the Kingdom of God,</HI> and so they must be capable of it. If capable of it, it must be upon Gospel terms; but what terms they are capable of but Baptism, I understand not.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) That <HI>there are two Sacraments necessary to Salvation; which implies a double Error,</HI> viz. <HI>that the Sacraments are necessary to Salvation, and that there are more Sacraments of the New-Testament than two.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I don't see wherein is the first Error, if he had truly repre|sented it; for it's said in the Catechism, two Sacraments <HI>generally</HI> n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|cessary; that is, that they are a Duty belonging to all persons tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are capable of it; where there are persons to baptize, and a Congre+gation to communicate with; and therefore is not said absolutely, but <HI>generally</HI> necessary.</P>
<P>As for the latter, a Sacrament is not a Scripture-word, but a Term of Art, and so hath been variously used and applied; and therefore to set out what it means, the Church has defined what a Sacrament is, and then shew'd there are but two: And so this Phrase is used to distinguish it from any other so called; and that then none but these two are generally ne|cessary to all Christians.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>The Book saith, Some Sins are deadly, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> if the Popish distinction of sins into Mortal and Venial, were a sound distinction</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> How can that be, when Fornication, which is called deadly in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Liturgy, in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> is ordinarily accounted a Venial Sin; and when the distinction between Mortal and Venial (as used in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>) is so contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI>? It's plain that our Church means thereby no other than <HI>he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nous.</HI></P>
<P N="4">(4.) It's said, <HI>Christ has redeemed all mankind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The Scripture saith, <HI>God will have all men to be saved</HI>; and that <HI>Christ died for al,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A stin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Liturgy,</HI> he saith. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> opposite to the Spirit of Prayer,</HI> Eph&punc; 6 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. If so, then the Spirit will not communicate it self in a Liturgy&punc; or stinted Form of Prayer, contrary to the sense of all sober Divines So Dr&punc; <HI>Owen Supposing,</HI> saith he,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Prayer</HI> p. 5&punc;</NOTE> <HI>those who make use of, and plead for Forms of Prayer&punc; especially in publick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o in a due manner prepare themselves for it by holy meditation</HI>&punc; &amp;c <HI>I do not judge that there is any such evil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n them&punc; as that God wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no communicate his Spirit to any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the use of them</HI>&punc;</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="32" REF="001592_0036_0FB3D98B2FD1AF18"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sacrileg. desert p.</HI> 102, &amp;c.</NOTE>2. If so, then <HI>almost all Churches in the world for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se</HI> 1300 <HI>years, at least, to this day</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> allows) have been without the Spirit of Prayer.</P>
<P N="3">3. If so, then we cannot lawfully communicate in, or with a stinted Liturgy, which has yet <HI>been approved by all Reformed Churches,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Ball</HI> saith;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Apol. c.</HI> 13.</NOTE> and Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> saith it's <HI>lawful to imbrace Communion with Churches, where such Forms in Publick Worship are in use.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. As for <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.18. that we are to <HI>pray with all Prayer</HI>; why is that not possible by a Liturgy, when there are in it Supplications, Prayers and giving of thanks?</P>
<P N="3">3. He lets pass the Argument, from the mischief of a prescript Li|turgy, and so will I pass what follows from the trivial, unintelligible, and dirty Reflections of it. For he knows we can match his <HI>Fidler,</HI> with Stories of some of those that have been Eminent the other way, and could argue upon the sinfulness of unpremeditated and conceived Prayer.</P>
<P N="4">4. He saith, Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> speaketh weightily, in saying, <HI>It's unlawful to bring ordinarily any other Book into the Publick Worship of God, besides the Book of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I know no difference between Reading and Reciting in this case; and I have heard Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> used a Form of Prayer in the Pulpit.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Clerks <HI>Collect. of Lives,</HI> p 38</NOTE> If he did not, yet all the Noncormists in former times did, as far as ever I could learn.</P>
<P>To close all; he undertakes to Answer an Objection, That <HI>Good men were the first Collectors and Publishers of the Liturgy, and died Martyrs.</HI></P>
<P>This he endeavours to answer; and yet when it's to serve his own Cause, it's a considerable Argument. Thus saith he before, <HI>The Corrup|tions of the Liturgy have been born witness against by good Men; and his Father, a Holy Man, suffered much for his Nonconformity,</HI> and what not. Now surely, If this sort of arguing is good for them, it's good for us.</P>
<P>But he Replies further,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>All Persons employed in it, were not good Men, as</HI> Day, <HI>Bishop of</HI> Chi|chester. <HI>He was a dissembling Hypocrite, pretending to be a Protestant, but afterwards shew'd himse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f to be a Papist.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A</HI> Here he betrays gross ignorance, or somewhat worse. For tho' <HI>Day</HI> was one of the 18 Bishops imployed for compiling the Service Book at first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barnet<HI>'s Reformat. Part.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 62. <HI>and Num.</HI> 25.</NOTE> <HI>Anno</HI> 1548. yet at that time he was for Transubstantiation, and Solitary Masses, and against having the Service in the Vulgar Tongue.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="001592_0037_0FB3D98C948B8968">And when the next Review was, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s 1550. when <HI>Cranmer</HI> wrote to <HI>Bucer</HI> about it, it does not appear that <HI>Day</HI> was concerned; nay, rather that he was against it, for he refused to set his hand to the Book, before it was enacted by a Law;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <HI>p.</HI> 203.</NOTE> and was afterward turn'd out of his Bishoprick, and depriv'd. But to say all in a word, What was this <HI>dissembling</HI> Hipocrite to those who <HI>were truly Pious Men, and acted faithfully according to the Light they had</HI>? as our Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hor acknowledgeth.</P>
<P N="2">2. He saith, Good men chang'd their minds, so did <HI>Ridley</HI> and <HI>Cranmer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A</HI> Both gross mistakes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fox<HI>'s Acts and Monu|ments, Fol.</HI> 1465.</NOTE> For Archbishop <HI>Cranmer</HI> took upon him to defend the Common Prayer, Ministration of the Sacra|ments, and other Rites and Ceremonies, when in Prison.</P>
<P>And Bishop <HI>Ridley,</HI> a little before his Martyrdom, in a Letter to his Friend, saith, <HI>This Church had of late the whole Divine Service, all Common &amp; Publick Prayers, framed to the true vein of Holy Scripture.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fox<HI>'s Acts, and Monu|ments, Vol.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 1940.</NOTE></P>
<P>And again, after his Condemnation, writing an Answer to <HI>Grindal,</HI> concerning <HI>Knox</HI>'s peremptory Exceptions against the Service Book; <HI>I grant,</HI> saith he, <HI>a Man (as he is) of Wit and Learning, may find apparent reasons,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide Dr.</HI> Taylor<HI>'s Martyr p.</HI> 1521.</NOTE> <HI>yet I suppose he cannot soundly by the Word of God so disprove any thing in it.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. He saith, <HI>Others were much troubled at the Service-Book</HI>; as Bishop <HI>Hooper.</HI> and Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> at home; and <HI>Calvin, Bucer, Mar|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, Bullenger,</HI> &amp;c. abroad. So <HI>Alasco</HI> and <HI>Knox,</HI> and the first Reformers in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> As for <HI>Hoopers</HI> dissatisfaction, it was not at the Liturgy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> Bur|net, <HI>p.</HI> 152, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> but the Episcopal Vestments; in which also he at last complied.</P>
<P>And as for <HI>Bucer</HI>'s mind, and <HI>Pet. Martyr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Reader will find it in the History of the Reformation, <HI>p.</HI> 154, 155. And <HI>Calvin</HI> to the <HI>English</HI> Exiles at <HI>Frankford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Epist.</HI> 200 <HI>and</HI> 206. <HI>and</HI> 228. <HI>That of</HI> A|lasco, <HI>printed An|no</HI> 1550. <HI>And that of</HI> Knox <HI>at Middel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> 1594.</NOTE> declares against a rigo|rous Opposition, and was pleased that he retained Moderation in this Case.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Alasco</HI> and <HI>Knox</HI>&punc; whatever they objected against the Liturgy, yet both had their Publick Offices, and Forms of Prayer.</P>
<P N="4">4. He saith, <HI>In Queen</HI> Elizabeth<HI>'s time, the Bishops made the Com|mon-Prayer Book in several things worse, and more intollerable than it was in the days of King</HI> Edward 6.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. And I hope he will confess in many things better.</P>
<P N="2">2. Why those Prayers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were left out, he may see in the History of the Reformation, <HI>p.</HI> 77, 170, 392.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="001592_0038_0FB3D98E13D12690">The reason of which has been before justified.</P>
<P N="3">3. There could be no great alteration to the worse, if that was all that he mentions; and however is nothing to us, when the Rubrick of the Communion is restored.</P>
<P>And now, that he may end as he begun, as he would have our Service-Book come from Popery; so he will have it, <HI>That time will discover that some, who pretend Zeal for the Common-Prayer Book are carrying on a design for</HI> Rome.</P>
<P>And time has discovered, that some of those who pretended Zeal against the Common-Prayer, carried on a design for <HI>Rome,</HI> and helped them for|ward in it, or stood as it were Neuters; and that the Liturgy has not so much a tendency that way, as Separation.</P>
<P>The World saw it in the late Reign, and found that the Church that uses the Liturgy, was a Bulwark against Popery; and when those that were against the Liturgy, either basely complied, fawn'd upon it, or cowardly were silent.</P>
<P>The Second Question.</P>
<P>Q 2. <HI>What reason have you to scruple the lawfulness of laying the Hand on the Book, and Kissing the Book in Swearing.</HI></P>
<P>To this he Answers.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We do not find in Scripture the Lords Servants were wont to swear after this manner; we read of lifting up the hand,</HI> &amp;c <HI>which is a natural sign of Worship.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. We find in Scripture, that they were wont to put the hand under the Thigh in swearing: And thus the same <HI>Abraham</HI> that lift up his hand, required his Servant to swear, by putting his hand under his Thigh, <HI>Gen.</HI> 24 2. and so <HI>Iacob</HI> made his Son <HI>Ioseph</HI> to use the same Ceremony when he swore, <HI>Gen.</HI> 47.19. Now what natural Sign of Worship was in this Rite?</P>
<P N="2">2. Since we find different Rites us'd, it's a sign that practice of the Lords Servants is to be no Rule to us in this matter; but that we are to govern our selves by the Custom of the place where, and the People among whom we live, if there be nothing in it self unlawful.</P>
<P N="3">3 He saith, and seems to allow i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, That the <HI>Romans</HI> of old, and <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> use to lift up the Finger when they swear solemnly. Now I conceive lifting up the Finger is no natural Sign of Worship. And if it had any signification, I know no reason why the <HI>Germans</HI> may not lift up three fingers; to intimate, they invoke the Sacred Trinity, which he saith, he <HI>cannot justifie.</HI> Nor why we may not lay the Hand upon, and Kiss th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Book in token of belief of it, and of our acting according to it, and of our being judged according to it&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="001592_0039_0FB3D98F9436BE60">For the word of God doth not prescribe in such cases.</P>
<P N="2">2. He answers, <HI>Laying the Hand on the Book is a symbolizing with Popish Ido|later<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Jews.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. It's not a symbolizing with Papists as such; since there are Papists that use other Ceremo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies in swearing, as he saith, The <HI>Italians, Spaniards,</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> do. And therefore, if this be a reason, why we must not lift up the Fingers, because they do so; so we must not lift up the Hand be|cause that is not to be done, but we must lift up the Fingers too.</P>
<P N="2">2. If it was customary among the <HI>Iews</HI> to produce the Law in giving an Oath, I see no reason to condemn it; and so know no hurt to observe it. They used also to adjure Persons, and our Saviour readily answers to it, when thus call'd upon.</P>
<P N="3">3. He replies, <HI>Kissing in a Religious way, is a gesture of Adoration.</HI> And he closes it, <HI>This is clearly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Worship a Book; and so to give unto a Creature that Honour which is due to God alone.</HI> And before he saith, <HI>So help you, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ntents of this Book; is it not much better than when the Papists say, So help <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God, and these Holy Evangelists, which is gross Idolatry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. That Kissing may be a token of Adoration, when the thing kiss'd is an Object of Adoration, is acknowle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ged. But it's not a token of Ado|ration, when the thing kissed is not an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bject of Adoration. Thus kissing the Calves, and an Image, is an act of Adoration, because the Object is an object of Adoration; but kissing the Book is not, becaus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Book is no object of Adoration.</P>
<P>If it be asked, Why then is the Book kissed? I say, it's in token of Re|verence, as it's the Book of God; and which, if I so kiss every time I read it, it's surely far from being Idolatry. And that it is so, appears from what follows, <HI>So help me God, and the Contents of this Book</HI>; which is in different ways, God by his Grace, and the Contents of this Book by their Instruction; the one as the efficient, the other the instrumental cause. And this without doubt is meant in the old Form, <HI>So help me God, and these Holy Evangelists,</HI> that is, the Gospel wrote by them; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the name of <HI>Moses</HI> is given in Scripture to his Writings. So that in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s sense it's neither Idolatry in them, nor any thing like it in us. And we may as lawfully kiss the Book, as lift up the Hand, since neither of them are prohibited by God's Law; and so being indifferent in themselves, we may act <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the case requires.</P>
