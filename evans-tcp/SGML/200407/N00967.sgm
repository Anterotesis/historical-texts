<HEAD>A SERMON Preached At Trinity Church in N. York The 28th of <HI>November,</HI> 1703.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 Cor. 12.13.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For by One Spirit are we all Baptized into One Body, whether we be <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> whether we be Bond or Free, and have been all made to drink into One Spirit.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SAint <HI>Paul,</HI> in the fore-going Verses of this Chapter, is holding forth the Variety of the Gifts and Graces of the holy Spirit, bestowed of God, through Jesus Christ, upon the Church, some whereof were peculiar to some Members of the Church, and extraordinary, and others were common and universal; also, he doth hold forth the several and peculiar Offices and Services that some Members of the Church had, which were not common to all: All which variety of Gifts and Offices &amp; Officers, did not make a plurality of Bodies, but still the Body of the Church is but
<PB N="4" REF="001161_0003_0FB095E6B60F37D8">
One consisting of many Members. The which Oneness of the Body he proves in the words of the Text, <HI>first,</HI> from the One <HI>holy Sacrament of Baptism,</HI> where-with all the Members ae baptized; <HI>secondly,</HI> from the <HI>One holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</HI> whereof all are made partakers, expressed in the Text synecdochically by <HI>drinking into One Spirit,</HI> as else-where it is synecdochicallye <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> by <HI>breaking of Bread,</HI> Acts 2&punc;4<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. That both the Sacraments are here understood, is the con|curring sense of Expositors upon this Text, and doth evi|dently appear so to be&punc; from St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s using the same way and method of Argument else-where, as <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4.5. from the <HI>One Baptism,</HI> as well as <HI>One Lord, One Faith, One God &amp; Father, One Body, One Spirit,</HI> and <HI>One Hope of their Calling,</HI> he proves the Unity of the Members; and 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.17. from the <HI>One Bread</HI> in the Lords Supper, whereof all are Partakers, he proves the like Unity of the Members; <HI>For</HI> (saith he) <HI>we being many, are one Bread, and one Body; for we are all partakers of that one Bread.</HI></P>
<P>But that which is further to be observed in the Text, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> visible Grace of the holy Spirit, I conveyed by and through the means and conduits of the external Signs or Symbols in both the Sacraments, whence a Sacrament is rightly defined to be <HI>An outward and visible Sign of an inward and spiritual Grace given unto us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same inward and spiritual Grace, and a Pledge to assure us thereof,</HI> and also it is a proper means and Memorial to preserve the Doctrine and Faith of Christ's Death and Passion, and the benefits thereof among us. And so the Church in her Catechism defines a Sacrament, and affirms, <HI>That there are two parts in each Sacrament,</HI> the one, <HI>the outward visible Sign,</HI> the other, <HI>the inward spiritual Grace; the which inward and spiritual Grace in Baptism is a Death unto Sin, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a new birth unto Righteousness,</HI> as well as
<PB N="5" REF="001161_0004_0FB095E8248CC7F0">
Remission of sin, by the Body and Blood of Christ applyed to us by a lively Faith; in all which the holy Spirit is the principal Author and Agent. And as in the Lords Supper the Body and Blood of Christ is received by Faith, so toge|ther with his Body and Blood, there's an increase of the sanctifying Grace and Gift of the holy Spirit, formerly given at Baptism, and also at the hearing and believing the Word preached by adult Persons.</P>
<P>This serves to detect the gross Falshood, Lyes and Calum|nies cast upon the Church by certain false Teachers, who not only reject those holy Sacraments, and teach their Hearers to vilifie and contemn them, as well as to reject the use of them, to their great hurt and sin, but do give a false Representation of the Doctrine and Practice of the Church, as if, according to her Doctrine, the Sacraments were nothing else but <HI>Signs,</HI> and <HI>empty Signs too,</HI> as some of them have affirmed, and much worse. And as if, by her Doctrine, the bare external action of the Minister, in the administration of Baptism, by pouring or sprinkling a little Water upon the face of a Person, whether infant or adult, did intirely constitute that person a <HI>Christian,</HI> which, ye see, from what is said in her Catechism, is not the Doctrine of the Church.</P>
<P>But the general Objection made, even by many others, who approve of the Practice of Baptism, both to Infants and Adult Persons, is, <HI>That the sanctifying Grace of the holy Spirit is not given universally to all baptized persons, either Infants or adult, for that in many baptized persons no certain signs or fruits of the sanctifying Grace of the holy Spirit doth appear in them. Beside that,</HI> Simon Magus <HI>was baptized, and yet was no san|ctified Person.</HI></P>
<P>To this <HI>I Answer</HI>; That if in adult persons no real signs of the sanctifying Grace of the holy Spirit appear in them after Baptism, it is because they have not received it with a
<PB N="6" REF="001161_0005_0FB095E99F155620">
sincere Faith, which is a necessary Requisit in all adult per|sons, in order to receive the inward and invisible Grace signi|fied by the external Sign; for as Unbelief is an obstruction to the holy Spirits operation, in hearing the Word preached, so it is no less to the same, either in Baptism or the Lords Supper. Next, as to Infants, if after they are become Adult, no real signs of the sanctifying Grace of the holy Spirit appear in them, the like reason may be given, that by their actual Unbelief and Unfaithfulness when they become adult, they have quenched and resisted the same; and yet it must be owned, that such is the goodness of God, that his holy Spirit, tho' oft quenched and resisted in his gracious motions, doth strive with those who are within the Pale of the visible Church, by Baptism, to convert &amp; turn them to God, more especially than with those who are without in the <HI>Heathen</HI> parts of the World. Even as God did strive, by his holy Spirit, to reclaim the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> so that his holy Spirit did not forsake them, but did wone and intreat them, as by his Prophets outwardly, so by his inward Calls and Motions to turn unto God, though they rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit, as it is said, <HI>Isa.</HI> 60.10. and this with respect that they were a People in covenant with him, by the Sacrament of Circumcision, &amp; other external Observances of his appoint|ment, according to <HI>Psal.</HI> 50.5. <HI>Gather my Saints together unto me, those that have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice</HI>; And indeed the word <HI>Saint,</HI> derived from the Latine verb <HI>Santio,</HI> signifies one in Covenant with God; and according to this, by virtue of the Covenant ratified by Circumcision, (the Seal of it) God did call them, as well inwardly by his Spirit, as outwardly by his Prophets, to turn to him, <HI>Ier.</HI> 3.14. <HI>Turn, O back-sliding Children! for I am Married unto you</HI>; compare this with <HI>vers.</HI> 1, 2. And no less favour have baptized Persons, by their <HI>Baptism,</HI> than the People of <HI>Israel</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="001161_0006_0FB095EF57A08DB0">
by <HI>Circumcision,</HI> tho' the external Symbols cannot save with|out the internal Grace signified thereby.</P>
<P>But the Adversaries of the holy Sacrament of Baptism, object, <HI>That St.</HI> Paul <HI>saith, there is</HI> One Baptism, <HI>and conse|quently&punc; Baptism with Water is ceased, being that of</HI> John, <HI>to give place to the Baptism of Christ, which is not with Water&punc; but with the holy Ghost and with Fire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answ.</HI> There is but <HI>One</HI> only Baptism for Remission of Sin, consisting of two parts, the <HI>external Water</HI> and the <HI>in|ternal Grace</HI> of Christ, and of the holy Ghost; but that Bap|tism with the holy Ghost and with Fire, which Christ pro|mised, and <HI>Iohn</HI> did fore-tell, being Miraculous, and not given, or intended to be given universally, is not that One Baptism common to all the faithful, and which is one of the Bonds of their Unity, as appears both from the words of the Text, and <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4.5. but That Baptism with Water was only <HI>Iohn</HI>'s, is plain contrary to the holy Scripture; for Christ also baptized with Water, tho' not with his own hands, but by the hands of his Disciples, as plainly appears from <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.26. compared with <HI>Ioh.</HI> 4.1, 2. And had not his Disciples at his Command and by his Authority baptized with Water, he could not be said to have baptized; for what they did by his command and authority, was his, and is said to be done by him. And though <HI>Iohn</HI> also baptized with Water, and that our Saviour did so honour his Baptism, that he did receive it, yet it doth not follow, that <HI>Iohn's</HI> Baptism with Water, and that which Christ commanded to his Disciples, (either before or after his Resurrection) was the same; for tho' the Element of Water was one in both, and the general end and intent in both was the same, to wit, <HI>Remission of Sin</HI> and <HI>Salvation,</HI> yet the different manner how Christ was set forth, as the Object of Faith, in that of <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Baptism, and that of Christs Disciples, makes a plain difference; for <HI>Iohn</HI> did
<PB N="8" REF="001161_0007_0FB095F1353093C0">
teach his Disciples, that they should believe in him the pro|mised Messiah (or Christ) that was to come, and baptized them in that Faith, but Christs Disciples &amp; Apostles baptized in the Faith of him that was come, beside divers other con|siderable Differences betwixt them. And in <HI>Acts</HI> 19.2, 3, 4, 5. we find, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> baptized certain persons who had be|fore received <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Baptism.</P>
<P>Nor hath it any weight against Baptism with Water, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> said, <HI>He thanked God he baptized but a few of the</HI> Co|rinthians, <HI>and that he was not sent to baptize, but to preach the Gospel</HI>; for the first, he said to take away all occasion from any of them, that, by reason of the Division that was among them, might say, <HI>That they were of Paul</HI>; for it plainly ap|pears that all the <HI>Corinthians</HI> were baptized, from <HI>Acts</HI> 18.8. and 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.13. <HI>even as many as believed</HI>; and his main and principal work, as an Apostle, was not to baptize with his own hands, as neither was it of the other Apostles, that Office being generally to be performed by inferior Ministers, whereas the Apostles main work was to preach the Gospel, they were, by their preaching, to lay the Foundation, and others to build on it the Superstructure, whereof even Bap|tism was a part.</P>
<P>The two holy Sacraments of the New-Testament, to wit, <HI>Baptism</HI> and the <HI>Supper,</HI> were figured forth under the Old Testament, as that of Baptism by the Baptism of the Chil|dren of <HI>Israel,</HI> together with their Wives &amp; infant Children, unto <HI>Moses</HI> in the Cloud, and in the Sea, which St. <HI>Paul</HI> takes special Notice of, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. as also of the Manna they did eat, and Water of the Rock that they drank of, in the Wil|derness, prefiguring the Lords Supper. And he makes his Discourse upon them an introduction to what he did after|wards deliver in the same Epistle, concerning the two Chri|stian Sacraments of Baptism and the Supper. As also, St.
<PB N="9" REF="001161_0008_0FB095F2A5B4AA08">
<HI>Peter</HI> declares, <HI>That</HI> Noah <HI>being saved by Water in the Ark,</HI> our Christian Baptism doth answer, <HI>to the like Figure, which doth now save us, not the putting away the filth of the flesh,</HI> [for that's not the end of it, to wash away natural filth of Dirt or Clay from the flesh] <HI>but the answer of a good Consci|ence, by the Resurrection of Iesus Christ</HI>; thereby referring to the answer that Persons to be baptized, were to give to the Questions to be asked them, before Baptism, with respect to their Faith, and professed and promised Subjection and Obedience to the Commands of Christ. Of both which the Church takes notice in the Office of Baptism of Infants, in the first Prayer. See now, how in that Baptism of the twelve Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> the Infant Children, as well as the Men and Women, were baptized unto <HI>Moses</HI> in the Cloud and in the Sea, without being plunged into Water, and yet being a true Baptism, was with Water, but not by Immersion.</P>
<P>That <HI>Holy Sacraments</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ell as the Word and Prayer) are necessary to the Constitution of the visible Church, ap|pears, That no Church ever was without them, either under the Old Testament or under the New&punc; The <HI>Iewish Church</HI> had their <HI>Sacraments</HI> appointed of God under the Old Testa|ment, <HI>viz. Circumcision</HI> and the <HI>Passover:</HI> By the <HI>first,</HI> all <HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Proselites</HI> of the <HI>Iews</HI> Religion, were initiated and incorporated into the <HI>Iewish Church,</HI> together with their Infant Children, being eight days old, such Proselites being called <HI>Proselites</HI> of the <HI>Covenant</HI>; and by the <HI>second, viz.</HI> the <HI>Passover,</HI> and other external Observances enjoyned unto them by Almighty God, they professed their continuance in Communion with the <HI>Iewish Church</HI>; and especially <HI>Circum|cision</HI> and the <HI>Passover,</HI> were unto them <HI>special means of Grace</HI> and <HI>Seals of the Covenant of Grace</HI> betwixt God and them; even as <HI>Baptism</HI> and the <HI>Lords Supper</HI> are the like
<PB N="10" REF="001161_0009_0FB095F428C393D0">
<HI>means of Grace,</HI> and <HI>Seals of his Covenant of Grace,</HI> now more clearly and amply exhibited and extended to Believers under the New Testament; and as <HI>Circumcision</HI> is called by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. 4.11. <HI>A Seal of the Righteousness of Faith,</HI> i. e. <HI>of the Covenant of Grace, to</HI> Abraham <HI>and to his Seed,</HI> under the Old Testament, so no less is <HI>Baptism</HI> to Believers under the New-Testament, and to their Seed [even their Infant Seed.] Which doth effectually evince and prove, that <HI>Baptism</HI> doth as really belong to Believers, and their Infant Children, under the Gospel, as Circumcision did belong to them under the Law, according to <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38, 39. And that the <HI>Lords Supper</HI> is a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, both signifying and sealing to all baptized Persons, who are faith|ful, their interest in Christ, in his precious Body and Blood, with all the spiritual benefits and blessings thereof, is evident from the words of our blessed Saviour to his Disciples, at the Institution, <HI>This Cup is the New-Testament in my Blood, which is shed for you,</HI> as in St. <HI>Luke</HI> 22.22. By the like Figure the <HI>Sacramental Cup</HI> is called by him, <HI>The New-Testamant</HI> or <HI>New Covenant,</HI> &amp;c. being the Seal of it, as Circumcision is called <HI>The Covenant of God,</HI> Gen. 17.13. being the Seal of it to <HI>Abraham</HI> and to his Seed.</P>
<P>It has been the way and method of God towards his Church, in all Ages from the beginning of the World, accor|ding to his great Goodness and Wisdom, to transact and deal with the same, and every Member thereof, by way of <HI>Covenant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 19.15. Deut. 7 6. &amp; chap. 14.2.26.18. Psal. 135.4.</NOTE> by which they became a peculiar People to him, in di|stinction from the <HI>Heathen</HI> part of Mankind. The Nature of which Covenant always had, and always hath, and ought to have these Three Pro|perties, <HI>VIZ.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="001161_0010_0FB096986107A870">I. <HI>A mutual Promising of both parties to perform to one an|other certain Conditions of the</HI> Covenant.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>A Solemn doing of this before such Witnesses especially as come under the same Covenant.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>That the said mutual promising and engaging of each party, the one to the other, be ratified and established by some external and visible Action, commonly called the</HI> Federal Rite, <HI>such as Circumcision was to the Covenant of Grace among the</HI> Jews, <HI>and such as Baptism is among</HI> Christians.</P>
<P>Hence, as God Almighty did take the Infant Children of believing <HI>Iews</HI> into Covenant with himself, (as is clear from <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.11, 12. and other Texts of Scripture) he did require a Promise of them at their Entry into his said Covenant, which they not being able to do by their own Mouthes, they were to do it by the Mouthes of some others under the same Covenant, and which others under the same Covenant could do, as well as their Parents, and of which an exact Record was to be kept, according to <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.12. Even so the <HI>Christian Baptism</HI> of Infant Children of believing Parents, being a Seal of the Covenant of Grace under the New-Testament, doth oblige those Infant Children, at their Baptism, to enter into Covenant with God, and thereby to become Members of the Church of Christ, and be incorporated into the same Body, according to 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.13. the which seeing they can|not do by their own Mouthes, they are to do by the Mouthes of others, which can be done as well by other <HI>Christians</HI> as by the Childrens own Parents; and what others do, doth in no respect lessen what the Parents ought to do in taking care of their Childrens Christian Education, which they are bound to do, without any such Promise.</P>
<P>Hence, by a clear Inference from what is above said, it folows,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="12" REF="001161_0011_0FB0969A8348E1A0">I. That as none among the <HI>Iews</HI> were in Covenant with God, but persons circumcised, and that none others were Members of the <HI>Iewish</HI> Church (<HI>Gen.</HI> 17.14.) but such; even so none are in Covenant with God now under the New-Testament, or Members of the <HI>Christian</HI> Church, <HI>Duely</HI> and <HI>Regularly,</HI> according to Gods appointment, but such who are baptized <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> 3.5.

<P N="2">II. That the Administration of Baptism to Infants of pro|fessed Believers, (as is in use among many Dissenters) wants a necessary and material part, where neither the Parents nor any others do promise in the Name of the Children to be baptized, what the Nature of the Covenant requires, <HI>viz.</HI> To perform the Terms &amp; Conditions required by Almighty God, in the Baptismal Covenant, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Child to be baptized <HI>Shall renounce the Devil and all his Works, the vain Pomp and Glory of the World, with all the covetous Desires of the same, so that he will not follow nor be led by them:</HI> 2dly, <HI>To believe all the Articles of the</HI> Christian <HI>Faith, summarily contained in the Apostles Creed:</HI> 3dly, <HI>To keep Gods holy Will and Commandments, and to walk in the same all the days of his Life.</HI> All that their Ministers require of him or them that present the Child to be baptized, and all that he or they pro|mise, is, To take care that the Child have a Christian Edu|cation, according to the Word of God; and as very com|monly hath been used, they require them to promise to give the Child an Education or Instruction according to the <HI>Con|fession,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="001161_0012_0FB0969CE65F6CE0">
and <HI>larger and shorter Catechisms</HI> of the <HI>Westminster Assembly,</HI> or some one or other of that called by them their <HI>Church Covenant,</HI> which is an Innovation and undue Impo|sition, without all warrant of holy Scripture, to require or give such a Promise: But forasmuch as it is not made in the Childs Name, it doth not oblige him. And thus their manner of administring Baptism to Infants, as it is deficient in one material and necessary part, so it is redundant and guilty of an imposed Innovation in another, as before mentioned.</P>
<P N="3">III. That a great multitude of Persons, both in <HI>England,</HI> and these <HI>American</HI> parts, who pretend to be the Church of God above all others, and to be the only Church, are no true Church of God at all, but a confused and disorderly heap and mixture, not only for their not having the holy Sacraments practised among them, which they vilifie &amp; contemn, calling them <HI>Worldly Elements</HI> and <HI>Beggerly Elements,</HI> but that what they call their Church wants not only the solemn <HI>Federal Rite</HI> of holy Baptism, but all the other necessary Properties of a Covenant betwixt God and Men, by which a true Church is constituted, (<HI>Tit.</HI> 2.14. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.9<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">) and is bound to him and one to another, by those three peculiar Properties of a Covenant above-mentioned; all which the <HI>Iewish</HI> Church had, by Gods appointment, under the Old Testament, and the <HI>Christian</HI> Church hath still had, and still is to have under the New, to the end of the World. At their entrance and admission into what they call their Church, neither the Adult by themselves, nor their Infant Children by any others, make any Promise to be the Lords, and to be faithful and obedient to him, nor give they any declaration before Wit|nesses, what they believe or profess, in order to Salvation. And as they have no Trying or manner of Initiating Per|sons
<PB N="14" REF="001161_0013_0FB0969E5F6A1D40">
into their Society, so nor have they any manner of try|ing those they call their Ministers, whether duly qualified and enabled to teach the Principles commonly professed by themselves. And that One Principle of theirs, <HI>viz. That not the Scriptures, but the Light within them, and which is the same in kind and nature in all Mankind, as well as in them, is the primary Rule of all their Faith and Practice,</HI> makes not only all the Articles of the Apostles Creed, but all other the peculiar and positive Precepts of the Gospel not only unneces|sary to them, but such as neither ought nor should be believed or practised by them, because their <HI>primary Rule,</HI> (as they call the Light within them (which they say doth sufficiently teach them, without the Scripture, all that is necessary to Salvation) and their only Foundation) dictates nothing to them of these matters.</P>
<P>But this sort of Persons, &amp; especially the Preachers among them, do oft in their Assemblies most prophanely &amp; ignorant|ly, as well as contemptuously exclaim against the manner of the holy Ordinance of Baptism, appointed by Jesus Christ, as it is practised in the <HI>Church of England,</HI> as if what these who present the Children to holy Baptism, commonly called God-fathers and God-mothers, did promise in the name and on the behalf of those Children, what they do not believe either they or the Children (in whose Name they promise) can perform at any time during this mortal life; and then they cry out, <HI>What confusion is here!</HI> Thus not only ridi|culing Gods holy Ordinance, but vilely and wretchedly lying against the <HI>Church of England</HI> &amp; her <HI>Christian</HI> Practice, as some of them have lately done in divers places of these <HI>American</HI> parts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Particularly one <HI>Tho.

Nor did those little Children whom our Saviour imbraced in his Arms know what he did unto them, and yet he said, <HI>Of such is the Kingdom of God</HI>; and further said, <HI>Suffer little Children to come to Me, and forbid them not,</HI> Mat. 19.13, 14.

<P>And they grosly scandalize the Ministers of the <HI>Church of

England,</HI> as if they did pretend to make <HI>Christians</HI> simply by the external Action of Water-Baptism: Whereas they but baptize with Water, and give the external <HI>Christian Name</HI> to the Person baptized, but they do not assume the part of God or of Christ, as these blasphemously do, who presume and pretend <HI>That they baptize with the Holy Ghost,</HI> which none of the Apostles were ever said to do, or presumed to do, it being the alone proper work of God and of Christ; for thus these men, contrary to all Antiquity, and the con|stant Sense of the Church of Christ in all Ages, as well as contrary to all true Reason, do impose their false gloss upon these words, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.20, 21. as if Christ had commanded them Not to baptize with VVater, but with the holy Ghost, whenas the Baptism with the holy Ghost in that miraculous way, as both Christ did promise it, and <HI>Iohn the Baptist</HI> did fore-tell it, was never given, nor intended to be given to all the faithful, but to some Persons, as God was pleased to be|stow it, and therefore could not be commanded to be given to all Believers; and to be sure, notwithstanding their false pretences, they have it no more than others. It ought to suffice us, and for which we ought to be thankful to Almighty God, that together with his Son, he hath given us his Word and Sacraments, and together with the same, his holy Spirit, to be our Sanctifier, though we have not these miraculous Gifts.</P>
<P><HI>To conclude,</HI> Let none of us who have listed our selves under Christs Banner, by our <HI>Baptismal Vow</HI> and <HI>Covenant,</HI> rest or rely upon the external Signs or Symbols of either of the holy Sacraments, but be earnest with God in Prayer, so to enable us by his holy Spirit to perform that part of our solemn Promise we made to God in our Baptism, to dye daily more and more unto sin, and to live unto Righteousness, that as we

<HEAD>An Appendix.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough in the fore-going Sermon, I hope, I have answered the most material Objections against Baptism, yet I find that divers of those false Teachers, when they think they cannot prevail to reject all Baptism with Water, they fall in with the <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> and cry out against the Manner of sprinkling Water on the face of the Person to be baptized, as if it were no Baptism, and call for Scripture-Example, where any were baptized by <HI>Sprink|ling,</HI> or <HI>pouring Water on them</HI> But I ask them for Scripture Ex|ample,
<PB N="20" REF="001161_0019_0FB096AB38DB2D00">
where any were baptized by <HI>Immersion</HI> or <HI>plunging the whole Body under Water?</HI> This we find no where expresly in Scripture, nor can (I think) it be inferred by any just consequence from Scripture; for though <HI>Iohn</HI> baptized at <HI>Iordan,</HI> yet it is not said he <HI>plunged</HI> their whole Bodies under water; and tho it is said, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.16. and <HI>Mark</HI> 1 10 <HI>That Iesus came up straightway out of the Water,</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> word [<HI>Apo</HI>] is properly translated [<HI>from</HI>] the water, and not [<HI>out</HI>] of the Water, and so <HI>Arias Montanus</HI> in the Latine version renders it <HI>de Aqua,</HI> and not <HI>extra Aquam, i. e.</HI> from the Water, and not out of the Water. And the like is to be said concerning the Eunuchs Baptism, <HI>Acts</HI> 8.38, 39. <HI>When they were come up out of the Water,</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> word there is (<HI>Ek</HI>) which is properly trans|lated [<HI>of</HI> or <HI>from</HI>] and <HI>Arias Montanus</HI>'s Latine Verson is as the other <HI>de Aqua.</HI> But suppose they did go into the Water, yet that proves not that <HI>Phillip</HI> plunged his whole Body under the Water, as no more it proves, that <HI>Phillips</HI> whole Body was under the Water. And that it is said, <HI>They both went down into the Water,</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> word in that place is (<HI>Eis</HI>) which is as well translated <HI>Vnto</HI> as <HI>Into</HI>; nor doth the English word <HI>Into</HI> signifie a going within or under the Water, no more than that Jesus is said, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.1. <HI>That he went up</HI> Into <HI>a Mountain,</HI> that he went within it, or under it. When <HI>Saul</HI> was baptized, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.18. and the Goaler was baptized, <HI>Act</HI> 16.33. and all his House, we do not read that they went to any River to be baptized, or that any River was near the places where they were baptized; and it is most probable that the Goaler was baptized either in the Prison, or in his own House; nor is it likely that St. <HI>Paul</HI> (having many stripes laid on him a little before) was in a condition, in the night time, to go to some River, no body knows where, or how far off, to baptize the Goaler and those of his house. Again, that it is said, <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.23. <HI>That</HI> John <HI>was baptizing at</HI> Enon, <HI>because there was much Water there</HI>; according to the <HI>Greek,</HI> and as <HI>Arias Montanus</HI> translates it, there were <HI>many Waters, i. e.</HI> not many Rivers, but many small Runs or streams of Water, which they who have given the Geography of the place, say, had not depth enough of Water to plunge the whole Body under the water; but <HI>Iohn</HI> baptizing so many Thousands as he did, there was need of much Water for the doing it, though he had used but a little to every one. Beside, we do not find that any of the Baptisms used
<PB N="21" REF="001161_0020_0FB096ACACE73188">
among the <HI>Iews,</HI> under the Law, was by a total immersion or plunging the whole Body under the Water. That the <HI>Iews</HI> had several sorts of Baptisms under the Law, is evident, and that they were so called, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.10. the Greek word, there translated <HI>Wash|ings,</HI> is <HI>Baptismois, i. e.</HI> Baptisms, and so doth <HI>Arias Montanus</HI> translate it, and so is it rendered on the Margin in divers English Bibles, and particularly in a large Octavo Bible printed at <HI>London,</HI> by <HI>H. H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">lls</HI> and <HI>Iohn Field,</HI> 1660 some of which Baptisms, if not most of them, were by sprinkling Water on the Persons, for their purifying, as plainly appears from <HI>Numb.</HI> 8.7. <HI>Sprinkle Water of Purifying upon them</HI>; and <HI>Numb.</HI> 19.13, 19. compared with <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.10, 19. And because in all Signs, the Sign and the thing signified thereby, doth answer by way of Analogy, hence as we are said to be washed by the Blood of Christ, so the heart of the Believer is said to be sprinkled by that Blood, (<HI>i. e.</HI> by the merit, virtue and efficacy of it, applyed by a true and lively faith) 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.2. com|pared with <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.22. And by the like Analogy, <HI>Ezek&punc;</HI> 36.25. God promised, <HI>That he would sprinkle clean Water upon his People</HI> (un|der the New-Testament) <HI>and they should be clean,</HI> which divers of the Antients understood of the Water of Baptism, as well as that <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.22. <HI>Your Bodies washed with pure Water,</HI> pure Water being a Hebraisme referring to the Water of purifying under the Law, <HI>Numb.</HI> 8.7. and 19.13, 19.</P>
<P>But their last Refuge is from the proper signification of the word <HI>Baptize,</HI> which, they say, some learned men, even of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> have affirmed, signifieth, to plunge the whole Body under Water, from the Greek word <HI>Baptizo. Answ.</HI> But that any of the <HI>Church of England</HI> have affirmed that to be the only, or yet the most proper and frequent signification of it, I do not remember that I have read. But supposing it were so, other men as learned, or per|haps more learned, have affirmed, and do affirm, that to plunge the whole Body under Water, is neither the only, nor the most proper signification of it; for it coming from the Greek word <HI>Bap|tizo,</HI> which is a derivative from the word <HI>Bapto,</HI> it looseth the force of the primitive word in its signification, as is usual in the like cases, as in the Latine, <HI>senesco, ditesco.</HI> Nor ought we to give trust to any learned man, if what he saith contradict the holy Scripture. But in the holy Scripture we find, that to wash the hands, or to have the
<PB N="22" REF="001161_0021_0FB096AE21735EA8">
hands washed, is to be baptized, <HI>Luke</HI> 11.38. where it is in our English Translation, <HI>he marvelled that he had not first washed,</HI> the Greek hath it <HI>Ebaptisthe, i. e.</HI> was not baptized: And the like in <HI>Mark</HI> 7.4. <HI>except they be baptized,</HI> according to the Greek, <HI>Baptizontas,</HI> and so it is in the English Bible above-mentioned, in those other two places last mentioned; and we are not to question it, for both St. <HI>Luke</HI> and St. <HI>Mark</HI> knew what was proper Greek, and how to write it, as well and much better than any learned man now in the World.</P>
<P>There are some few others, that being convinced of the <HI>Quakers</HI> vilest and grossest Errors, in the Province of <HI>Pennsilvania</HI> have left their Meetings, and have set up a Meeting by themselves, and as yet continue to hold it up in two or three places, some of whose Speakers have with great rashness and presumption, without all shadow of warrant from holy Scripture, taken upon them Autho|rity or Power to baptize, upon the pretence of the inward Call of the holy Spirit, with whom I have had some Conference, they ha|ving been formerly joyned with me against the <HI>Quakers</HI> vilest Er|rors, I put them close to it, to give any proof either of Precept or Example in Scripture, where any baptized, who had not an outward Call and Ordination, by laying on of hands, by some that were their spiritual Superiors in the Church? And as concerning <HI>Phillips</HI> bap|tizing those of <HI>Samaria, Acts</HI> 8.12. and the Eunuch, <HI>Acts</HI> 8 38. it is evident, that he was one of the seven Deacons who had Ordina|tion by the laying on of the hands of the Apostles, <HI>Acts</HI> 6.5, 6. But to this they confessed, that they could give no Proof, by either Precept or Example in Scripture. And as to that pretence of their inward Call by the Spirit, I told them, That was not sufficient to convince others, or satisfie them they had such an inward Call that did suffice without the outward Call, unless they could demonstrate their inward Call, either by Miracles, or some other way equivo|lent; for tho' <HI>Iohn</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> wrought no Miracle, and his Baptism was from Heaven, yet he was a Prophet, and had divers concurring Demonstrations to prove his Doctrine and Baptism, that they were of God, and particularly our Saviours Testimony concerning him, and his Father <HI>Zachariah's</HI> prophecy of him. I further told them, they might by the like pretence <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, they had an inward Call or Commission to be Mayor or other Magistrate in the Town
<PB N="23" REF="001161_0022_0FB096B040977188">
of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> which few, if any, would believe, though they should pretend to it, which I thought their Modesty would not suffer them to use any such Pretence. I also told them, that it was to be observ'd by them, that tho' our blessed Saviour was filled with the holy Spirit above measure, yet he had an outward Call by an outward audible Voice from Heaven, by his Father,; and the A|postles had their outward Call from our Saviour, by audible words, and his laying his hands on them; and the Apostles did lay hands on others whom they ordained; and They were to do it on others who should suceed them, to keep up outward Order in the Church. And I asked them, whether outward Order in the Church was not as necessary as outward Order in the civil State, to prevent con|fusion? They answered&punc; It was, when there were many; and when they became <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, they would likewise have it: But upon the supposition that they should become many (which they are not like to be) how could they hinder others which might rise up among themselves, and lay equal claim to the inward Call of the Spirit, as any of them?</P>
<P>The <HI>Church of England</HI> not only approves of the inward Call, or moving of the holy Spirit to the Ministerial Function, but the first Question that the Bishop asketh of any that is to be ordained a Deacon, is, <HI>Whether he is moved of the holy Ghost to undertake the same?</HI> and if he should say, Nay, the Bishop would not ordain him</P>
<P>Their last evasion is, <HI>They had none to whom they could apply for Ordination; for as to the</HI> Church of England (one of them said) <HI>their Bishops had their Ordination from the Pope.</HI> [But this is a common Objection of other Dissenters, as well as of those above-mentioned.] I told him, it was a Mistake; He said, <HI>he had it of them whom he had cause to believe, more than to believe me</HI> [But he did not tell his Au|thors] I replyed, That of whomsoever he had it (whether of me formerly, for I confess, I was (when under the Profession of a <HI>Quaker</HI>) in the same mistake; but now, I thank God, I am better inform'd) it was a great mistake &amp; abuse; for there were Bishops in <HI>England</HI> before either Popery or Pope was in the World, and there has been a continued Succession of Bishops in <HI>England</HI> ever since the first planting of the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> And tho' as well before the immediate Reformation from Errors, both in Doctrine and
<PB N="24" REF="001161_0023_0FB096B1201D5810">
Practice, as for some Ages antecedent, the <HI>Church of England</HI> was too much corrupted with the Errors of the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> yet that corruption prevailed rather in a Faction than in the whole Body of the Church; and whatever Power the Popes of <HI>Rome</HI> claimed over the Church of <HI>England,</HI> before the Reformation&punc; it was but an U|surpation, and was never generally consented to by the whole Church. Beside, we are to distinguish betwixt the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> her self and the <HI>Papacy,</HI> as betwixt a diseased Person or Leper, and the Leprosie that cleaves to him, who is the same Man still when Leprous, and when cured of his Leprosie, by some Miracle. The <HI>Church of England,</HI> (as other <HI>Protestant Churches</HI>) became reformed, and was not to have a new Foundation. And as she was not to throw away the Scriptures, nor Sacraments, nor many other Do|ctrines of <HI>Christianity,</HI> because held with great mixtures of Cor|ruption among them, but retain the good, and reject all that was evil; so nor was she to reject <HI>Church-Government</HI> and <HI>Ordination,</HI> and distinction of Church Officers, well warranted by holy Scrip|ture. The Scripture fore-told, <HI>That Anti-christ was to sit in the Temple of God,</HI> and <HI>That God was to have a People in Mystical Babylon,</HI> which is no argument that the Church was not the Temple of God still, and his People in <HI>Babylon,</HI> were not his People.</P>
