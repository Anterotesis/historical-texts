<P>A Copy of the following Letter casually coming to hand, I could not forbear publishing it at this juncture, when Six Men (commonly call'd the Six <HI>INOCULATION MINI|STERS</HI>) without any weight of Argu|ment, by meer importunity, and reiterated Praying, Prea|ching, and Scribling (<HI>gutta cavit lapidem non vi sed saep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">adendo</HI>) do indeavour that the infatuation of <HI>Self-pro|curing the Small Pox,</HI> may become universal.</P>
<P>The <HI>Epistolary Manner,</HI> may excuse <HI>its not being nicely</HI> correct and well digested, the <HI>freedom</HI> used in canvassing the matter, and the <HI>warmth</HI> with which the Author in se|veral incidents expresseth himself; which perhaps the rigour of a formal Discourse &amp;c. would not allow.</P>
<P>The <HI>Country</HI> and <HI>Ministers</HI> are not reflected on, but ra|ther <HI>vindicated,</HI> by laying the reproach on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e particular Persons who alone have rendred themselves obnoxious.

<P><HI>All Countrys,</HI> or Bodys Politick, (our own Mother Country not excepted) have been subject to <HI>Infatuations</HI>: These in this Country seem always to have proceeded from some of those who call themselves <HI>Sons of Lev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> The <HI>Persecution of the Quakers</HI> about the Year 1658&punc; t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nging of those suspected of Witchcraft,</HI> about the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear 1691, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and <HI>Inoculation,</HI> or <HI>Self-procuring the Small Pox,</HI> in the Year 1721; and to speak like an Astrono|mer,

<P>By the Indulgence of our Charter, the <HI>Ministers of all sorts</HI> are left <HI>sui juris,</HI> which may be the natural Cause why some of them, abusing this Priviledge, do meddle in Matters not in the least appertaining to them.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SOME time ago, I promis'd to send you some <HI>new Observations</HI> I have lately made in some ex|traordinary Cases of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and its in|cident Symptoms. At this time I entertain you with our most extraordinary Occurrence relating to that Distemper, <HI>viz.</HI> The Com|munication commonly call'd, <HI>Inoculation of the Small Pox, by applying some laudable variolous Pus, to a fresh cutaneous Incision in a Person who never had the Small Pox; se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en or eight Days, sooner or later after this Application&punc; arises a Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; whose Crisis is a cutaneous Eruption, some|thing analagous to the Small Pox Pustules, and sometimes a true genuine Small Pox; but with an uncertain Period of Eruption, Maturation and Desquamation.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The Rise, Progress and Success of this novel Practice, or artificial Small Pox, in <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>A Physician of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Place, lent to a certain Reverend Gentleman of the Town the <HI>Philosophical Transactions,</HI> wherein he found the Letters of <HI>Timonius</HI> and <HI>Pylarinus,</HI> from the <HI>Levant</HI> to the <HI>Royal Society</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> giving some Account of the Method and Success of this Practice in those Countries; being a Man of <HI>Whim</HI> and <HI>Credulity,</HI> thinks this Juncture a fit Opportunity to
<PB N="2" REF="002332_0005_0FDBC95137F8BC40">
make Experiments on his Neighbours, (which in Vani|ty he might judge acceptable to the Royal Society,) takes the Hint, sends circular Letters to all the Practi|tioners of the Place, (the owner of the Transactions ex|cepted,) inviting them to come into it. At first they all declined so rash and ill vouched a Practice: At length one of them (more bold than wise or knowing in his Business) finding by his <HI>bad Success</HI> in the cure of his first <HI>natural</HI> Small Pox Patients, that he should make but a poor hand of it, embraces the Project; but being rash and unlucky in his first Experiments, he was <HI>pub|lickly expos'd</HI>: Then he applys to the two Ministers of the Congregation to which he belongs (being himself <HI>illiterate</HI>) to vindicate his Character as an able Practi|tioner: They as his good and careful <HI>Pastors,</HI> with three or four more Parsons whose Assistance were desired, take him under their Protection, and in Print bestow on him <HI>Quackish Characters</HI> high enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o make the most celebrated Physician in <HI>England</HI> blush. Thus these few of the Clergy were drawn in to support the <HI>Inocu|lator,</HI> and consequently <HI>Inoculation</HI> it self; and you know&punc; many Clergymen think they give up their Cha|racter of <HI>Ora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">les,</HI> if they should <HI>retract</HI> tho' in matters the most absurd. Several things were publish'd in the Week|ly News Papers by the Pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">itioners (as in Duty bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d) to put a stop to this rash and dubious Practice; (<HI>N B.</HI> at this time those Ministers contrived to shut the Press a|gainst them) and much has been since that wrote on the other side by the <HI>Inoculating Parsons,</HI> full of <HI>Cant</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">&punc; The <HI>Small-Pox</HI> being so universal for some time past, the Practitioners could not find Time to pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and give them suitable Answers; upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this the Parsons b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">came uppi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, thinking they had gain'd the Field of Battle; but now, GOD be thank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, the Small Pox is over&punc; and the Practitioners are like to find leisure Time to amuse the Town and themselves in driving them home within their own <HI>Lines.</HI></P>
<P>In the first Tryals, the <HI>Eruption P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er of B&mdash;n</HI>'s Son and old Mr. <HI>W&mdash;b,</HI> startled the Inoculators; but as
<PB N="3" REF="002332_0006_0FDBC95375A08400">
Persons scorning to give ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and in Contempt of the <HI>Guardians</HI> or <HI>Select-Men</HI> of the Town who forbid the Practice, as also contrary to the declared Opinion of the <HI>Practitioners in Physick,</HI> they make a second Attempt on a few with indifferent good Success: At length many inoculated <HI>suffer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI>; Mrs. <HI>D&mdash;l</HI> (and others whom Time may bring to light) <HI>dye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> of it&punc; Then they gave out, that the Infection was so universal, that it was likely all the Inoculated had received the Infection in the common Way, and the difference of Climate from that in the Levant was the reason of the Eruptions be|ing mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. They seem to intermit the Practice for some time; but lest it should be taken for recanting, they <HI>ral|ly</HI> once more, and with Precaution inoculate those who could not be suspected of having received the Infection in the natural Way, for some Days pretty lucky; but soon after several of the Inoculated <HI>dye,</HI> and many suf|fer much. Now they say the Winter Season will not do, tho' this is the only Season recommended by their <HI>Authors</HI>: So that with various Success it has been practised since the middle of <HI>Iune</HI> to this Time on about Two Hundred Subjects. When the Confusion is over, I shall be able to learn some Remarkables in their Cares, and transmit them to you.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Motives and Methods used to induce Peo|ple to this Practice.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Timodius an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Communications to the Royal Society,</HI> (falsely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid in a late Paper to be appro|ved of by them.) If all that is published in the <HI>Phy|losophical Transactions, viz.</HI> Amusements, Projects, cre|dulous Relations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ought to be put in Practice, the World would be soon turn'd upside down. How ridicu|lous is it then to find fault with the owner of the <HI>Trans|actions,</HI> because he does not comply with their <HI>WICKED DESIRES</HI> to reprint here those Accounts of the <HI>Le|vant Gentlemen?</HI> He has more regard to the Lives and Health of his Neighbours, than thus to bring them in|to a <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">are.</HI> If his Conscience could give way to such
<PB N="4" REF="002332_0007_0FDBC955B9C3B070">
Things, he might transcribe and publish from the <HI>Philo|sophical Transactions</HI> and other Authors, many Projects and Amusements, no less feizable than this, but which might prove <HI>dangerous Edge-Tools in the Hands of Fools.</HI> I shall instance but one, which if it were not for its bad Consequences, might be of vastly more universal Benefit to Mankind.</P>
<P>The <HI>Transfusion of the Blood</HI> of a sound Person into the body of a Morbid Subject, first projected and practised by a very eminent Physician Dr. <HI>Richard Lower</HI>: It is to be found in <HI>Phil. Transact.</HI> for <HI>Dec.</HI> 1666, being a <HI>Letter</HI> to the Hon. Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> dated <HI>Oxford</HI> 6th <HI>Iuly,</HI> 1666. where he describes the whole process of the Operation: It was afterwards put in Practice in <HI>France,</HI> and published there <HI>March</HI> 1667; and in Dr. <HI>Lower</HI>'s Works since pub|lished, it is farther recommended&punc; saying, that tho' it is the disposition of some Men not to be pleased, and not to allow of any new thing but what proceeds from themselves, he doubts not but this <HI>Invention</HI> may be much for the benefit of Mankind, if practised by a well advised and discreet Person; then gives instances of some on whom this had been practised; afterwards tells what Subjects may allow of this Practice, and recom|mends it in the <HI>Gout</HI> and many other <HI>chronical A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s</HI>; and desires the <HI>Physicians</HI> all the World over to put it in Practice, that by use and custom the Practice of it may become universal; concludes, that as <HI>Harvey</HI> discovered the benefit of <HI>Circulation</HI> within the proper vessels of an individual, he had found the way of <HI>transferring Circula|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on</HI> without the Sphere of the Individual, for the bene|fit of a second Person.</P>
<P>All our <HI>Inoculators</HI> (Dr. <HI>C. M.</HI> excepted) have these <HI>Levant</HI> or far fetch'd Accounts only at <HI>third Hand</HI> (so strong is their faith) viz. from the partial abstract of <HI>C. M.</HI> of the abstract of Dr. <HI>Woodward,</HI> from <HI>Timonius</HI> Original Letter which is not published in the <HI>Transacti|ons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Timonius</HI> and <HI>Pylarinus</HI> in <HI>some things clash</HI>; the first says it came from <HI>Asia,</HI> the other from <HI>Greece&punc; Timonius</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="002332_0008_0FDBC95B2C29A618">
says it had been practised for about the space of Forty Years among the <HI>Turks</HI> and others at <HI>Constantinople. Pylarinus</HI> (the latest Author) says, That the <HI>Turks</HI> only would not come into it, because repugnant to their doctrine of <HI>Predestination.</HI> Thus one would think they were writing concerning a thing they had rather heard than seen much of, especially if we take <HI>Pylarinus</HI> own words, <HI>Quamvis de omnibus, ut ingenue fatear ocula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us testis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sse non possum,</HI> meaning all the circumstances of this Operation or Practice: and take their whole accounts, <HI>Phil. Transact.</HI> No. 339.347. you will find they did not know half so much as we do at present in our short <HI>ino|culation</HI> Practice, <HI>v. g.</HI> The Operatrix says, <HI>The Pus of the Artificial Small Pox is ineffectual for further transplan|tation; Pylarinus,</HI> its true, conjectures (not having try'd it) that it may be more benign and more effectual; but <HI>we</HI> have put it in practice and suffered thereby. <HI>Pylari|nus</HI> forbids Flesh and Wine for forty days, because some who have erred in that point have run great hazards by fresh eruptions; <HI>we</HI> confine them to no <HI>Regimen</HI> only for a few Days about the eruption. <HI>Timonius</HI> says, <HI>None that ever used it, dyed of the Small Pox</HI>; and in another place mentions two inoculated Children who dyed, but says he <HI>it was of Cacochymy; we</HI> to our sad experience know, that several have dyed. He says without reserve, They who have this <HI>Inoculation</HI> practised upon them are sub|ject to very slight Symptoms, and in another place of 50 who were <HI>Inoculated</HI> about the same time, four had the Symptoms worse, and came near the <HI>confluent kind,</HI> as we have also learn'd in our experience; several of the Inoculated in <HI>Boston,</HI> when I insinuated to them the danger of having, after some time, the Small Pox in the common way, told me, it could not possibly happen, because their <HI>eruption Fever was more violent than gene|rally in the common way.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>faithfulness</HI> of Dr. <HI>C. M</HI>'s abstract, on which foundation all did at first depend, take these few instan|ces. <HI>Timonius</HI> says, <HI>at first the more prudent were cauti|ous. C. M.</HI> turns it, <HI>At first the People were cautious,</HI> be|ing
<PB N="6" REF="002332_0009_0FDBC966655B5AC0">
unwilling to say it was <HI>prudence to be cautious. Pylarinus</HI> says, <HI>Turcae h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nc negle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erant huc us&abque;</HI> Our <HI>fidus interpres</HI> renders it, <HI>The Turks do not yet much come into it; Pylarinus</HI> in English is, <HI>the Turks had not at all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n come into it. Pylarinus</HI> says, <HI>Nunquam fere ex trans|plantatione hac funesti</HI> (mortal) <HI>quid accid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sse observa|tum fuit hactenus</HI>; our straining interpreter renders it, <HI>that it was hardly ever known that there was any ill con|sequences of this Transplantation</HI>; which is a very unfair and fatal Translation, designing that his Readers should not think that <HI>Death</HI> or Fatality sometimes follow it, tho' other <HI>bad consequences</HI> may. He <HI>partially</HI> omits every thing that seems not to favour the Project; he does not tell us that <HI>Pylarinus</HI> advises it (<HI>immaniter grassa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te Varicl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> Epidemia</HI>) when the Small Pox was very malignant, and <HI>Timonius</HI> in the time when it was so mortal that half the infected dyed; then indeed (if the Law allow) an <HI>Anceps Remedium</HI> may be embraced, but not when it is so favourable that not above one in 10 dye of it. He with no good design omits that passage in <HI>Timonius,</HI> that of 50 who had this <HI>Inoculation</HI> practi|sed upon them almost the same day, four had the erup|tions too sudden, Tubercles more, and Symptoms worse, and came near the confluent kind; and a little farther a Boy 3 <HI>aet.</HI> of a bad habit of Body who was Inoculated, had the Small Pox as is usual in that way, but about the fortieth day dies of a <HI>Marasmus.</HI> A Girle 3 <HI>aet.</HI> of a bad habit and looseness of long standing, had as u|sual the Small Pox by Inoculation, but dies the thirty second Day. To conclude our Abstractor's <HI>PROBITY</HI> in the matter, he says, that the <HI>Author</HI> of these <HI>Abridg|ments</HI> addressed them to those who had the <HI>Originals</HI> in their Hands, and therefore it could not be thought that it was not as faithful a report as could be made of the matter. The truth is, he sent his Abstract to all the no|ted Practitioners in Town, but not to the owner of the <HI>Philosophical Transactions. Proh. fides</HI>!</P>
<P>Their second Voucher is an Army of half a Dozen or half a Score <HI>Africans,</HI> by others call'd Negroe Slaves,
<PB N="7" REF="002332_0010_0FDBC96931923368">
who tell us now (tho' never before) that it is practised in their own Country. The more blundering and Ne|groish they tell their Story, it is the more credible says <HI>C. M</HI>; a <HI>paradox in Nature</HI>; for all they say true or false is after the same manner. There is not a Race of Men on Earth more <HI>False Lyars,</HI> &amp;c. Their Accounts of what was done in their Country was never depended up|on till now for Arguments sake. Many <HI>Negroes</HI> to my knowledge have assured their Masters that they had the Small Pox in their own Country or elsewhere, and have now had it in <HI>Boston.</HI> Some of Dr. <HI>M</HI>'s <HI>Inoculated Ar|my</HI> have had the same Fate, which might serve as an Argument that the <HI>Inoculated</HI> may have the Small Pox afterwards in the common way; but such weak Argu|ments our cause does not require. To confirm this you have at length in two of their little Books a silly Story or familiar Interview and Conversation between two <HI>black</HI> (Negroe) <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> and a couple of the <HI>Reverend Promoters,</HI> concerning Inoculation. <HI>O Rare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce!</HI></P>
<P>Their third <HI>Allegation</HI> in favour of it is, <HI>If it had been unsuccessful or attended with bad consequences</HI> (since it has been practised many Years in <HI>Turky) it must needs have been out of countenance and have ceased long ago.</HI> An indifferent Person would more naturally reason thus&punc; If it had not been attended with bad consequences (since it has been known to several <HI>Physicicians</HI> all over <HI>Europe</HI> for many Years) and being so safe for the time and of such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unparrallel'd usefulness, it must have been prac|tised all the World over long ago, not so many <HI>Princes</HI> and great <HI>Statesmen</HI> have died of the <HI>Small Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and all the <HI>Christian</HI> world continue so long in an <HI>obstinate breach of the sixth Commandment.</HI></P>

<P>Their indistinct, confused, superficial Notions of Things, makes their <HI>Physical Comparisons so wild.</HI> They compare the taking of preventing Physick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the Pro|curing a Contagious Distemper. They do not know how to distinguish between a Disease simply Epidemick, and a <HI>Contagious Epidemical Distemper</HI>; many Methods may be allowed of in the First, which are Dangerous and Destructive in the other. <HI>Preventive Physick</HI> I think, is generally given to prevent Relapses, but not the first onset of Diseases. I never heard of a <HI>Salivation</HI> given to prevent a <HI>Pox,</HI> nor of <HI>Vesicatorys</HI> to one who never had the <HI>Head-ake</HI> to secure him from it. If any Patient thought that one in Thirty, or Forty, or an Hun|dred, died of a <HI>Vomit,</HI> or any other preventive Physick, it could not be expected they would undergo it, especi|ally if the Consequence must certainly be some <HI>dubious Distemper.</HI></P>
<P>The Comparison of the <HI>Cortex Peru,</HI> or Jesuits Powder, favours this Practice most, being a true Specifick in in|termitting Fevers or Agues. We learnt it from the <HI>Spa|nish Indians</HI> in the Southern Parts of <HI>America.</HI> It was found to prevent totally, or for some considerable time the return of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ish Fits.</HI> At its first Entrance into <HI>Eu|rope</HI> not having by Experience (<HI>and to the Cost of the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st Tryers</HI>) learnt the dosing and timing of it, and what Constitutions would bear it, instead of the intermitting Fever which it prevented, it left many <HI>chronical</HI> and <HI>fatal</HI> Ails, which did not appear but in Process of time; So that People were very shy of it, and chose rather the <HI>Ague</HI> should take its natural Course, or usual Method of Cure, tho' a few did die of it; than be liable to these <HI>After-claps,</HI> of which in Process of Time many died. I ask our <HI>Conscience Directors,</HI> whether at that time, they who would not use the <HI>Cortex</HI> (for then the salutary use o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it was not known) were Breakers of the Sixth Com|mandment?

<P>The Fifth <HI>Motive</HI> to induce People to come into this Method of Inoculation, is the <HI>late Accounts from En|gland,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> its being last Summer practis'd and approv'd of there. The KING (says one of the Inoculators) <HI>Prince,</HI> and most eminent Physicians in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Dublin,</HI> have declared their Approbation of it, and it is a <HI>successful Practice</HI> there. This is either a <HI>Dream,</HI> second Sight, or a contrived <HI>Story,</HI> for the latest News from thence only tell us that after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch Intercession of some <HI>Surgeons</HI> who were in the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">our of making Experiments, and the KING's advising with the learned at Law, the KING did condescend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> allow this to be tryed on a <HI>few con|demned Criminals.</HI> Some <HI>News-Writers,</HI> according to Custom, without any good Authority, say it was likely to get into <HI>private Familys,</HI> but mention no Particulars, and consequently wants Confirmation; what the par|tial Accounts of the Success of this Practice in <HI>Boston</HI> sent home, may do in the influencing some to give into it, I shall not foretell. From this we may learn&punc; that in <HI>En|gland</HI> they did not venture on it without Permission of the Government; our Inoculating Parsons do it in Spite of the Government, or <HI>Select Men</HI> of the Town</P>
<P>Their Sixth <HI>Allegation</HI> in favour of it is, <HI>Altho' pro|curing Illness to a Man's own Person without any further View, be certainly a Sin; yet if it be to prevent a greater,</HI> (tho' uncertain) <HI>it becomes a Duty.</HI> From this Princi|ple, the greatest <HI>Abominations</HI> are allowable. <HI>v. g.</HI> The curing or preventing a <HI>Chlorosis,</HI> (whereof many die) where in some Cases the best Authors advise <HI>Matrimony,</HI> and Matrimony cannot be conveniently obtain'd.

<P>Their History of its Success is shortly this. At first they gave out, <HI>That it was a Method not infecting, pro|curing only a small quantity of Eruptions, but never Death, nor any bad consequence, and was an infallible Security against ever after having the Small Pox.</HI> This was attes|ted <HI>ex verbo Sacerdotum</HI>; and who would not have com|ply'd with it, if <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> founded partly on the <HI>Testimony</HI> of some who had been in the <HI>Levant,</HI> had not been stronger than our <HI>Faith</HI> in these Parsons <HI>grati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dictum</HI>; and in process of Time our own <HI>Experience</HI> con|cur'd with these Testimonies: We soon found it <HI>infect|ing</HI>; many have dy'd of the Infection received from the Inoculated, whose <HI>Deaths</HI> in a great measure lies at the <HI>Inoculators Doors.</HI> Then the Parsons gave up this Point, but continued to maintain the rest, till they found some of the Inoculated wlth <HI>immense Number of Pustules.</HI> This they attribute to the difference of Clmate; and <HI>be|ing but Learners, we hope in a little Time to be more Ex|pert</HI> (says D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>M.) but none ever dy'd of it these forty Years, (vide</HI> Some Account <HI>P.</HI> 10. &amp;c.) then <HI>dyes</HI> the I|noculated Mrs. <HI>D&mdash;l,</HI> (besides several others who dye in the crowd when the <HI>Distemper</HI> was <HI>universal</HI> and at the height; for they acknowledge (<HI>P.</HI> 11. of some Account) that <HI>many more were inoculated than they judged proper to mention, because of the clamour of the People</HI>: (some of the <HI>Inoculators</HI> said she receiv'd the <HI>Infection</HI> in the com|mon Way, tho' the most <HI>cautious of Women,</HI> and every thing wrought as is usual in Inoculation; Others of them say she dy'd of <HI>Hysterick Fits,</HI> not considering that Hysterick Fits are no mortal Distemper; and it be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ays

may generally observe, the Inoculated are generally the <HI>Devotees</HI> of some <HI>Inoculating Parson</HI>: At first it was <HI>Con|gregational,</HI> being almost confined to Mr. <HI>W&mdash;b</HI>'s Hear|ers; then it spread among the <HI>Devotees</HI> of Dr. <HI>M.</HI> and Mr. <HI>C.</HI>; and lately many being buzz'd in the Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the great <HI>Losses</HI> sustain'd in the Natural Way, have as it were in <HI>Despair</HI> come into it.</P>
<P N="3">III. Reasons against the Use of Inoculation at present, and until further Light.</P>
<P>My humble Opinion of <HI>Inoculation</HI> is as of all bold Experiments of Consequence in the <HI>Practice of Physick</HI>&punc; That whatever the Success or Consequences may be, (and the more Tryals the more Light) they may be of a pub|lick Advantage, tho' at the <HI>Risque</HI> of the first Patients. If it answer, after Generations will reap the Benefit of it; if otherways, the miserable Sufferers will be record|ed as bold, rash, infatuated <HI>Fools,</HI> the Practice for ever after abhor'd, and the Promoters thereof stigmatized as <HI>Murtherers.</HI></P>
<P>All solid and sound <HI>Phylosophy,</HI> that is <HI>Natural History,</HI> is founded on <HI>Observations</HI> made, and <HI>Experiments</HI> taken of the various Actions and Influences of <HI>Natural Bodys</HI> on one another. I was always fond of this kind of Know|ledge, especially as it related to <HI>Humane Bodies</HI> in a <HI>Heal|thy</HI> or <HI>Morbid</HI> State; and if these two dear Characters of a Good <HI>Citizen</HI> and Good <HI>Christian</HI> could be dispensed with, I should have been pleased to see some Thousands inoculated with several other Distempers as well as the <HI>Small Pox</HI>; but for the following <HI>Reasons</HI> I could not at present comply with this novel, rash, and <HI>dubious</HI> Practice.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Poysoning and spreading infection, are by the penal Laws of</HI> England <HI>Felony.</HI> Inoculation falls in with the first withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any Contradiction; and if a Person of so <HI>weak a Constitution,</HI> that any the least Illness may prove fatal to him, should be inoculated, and suffer but the tenth Part of what several of the <HI>Inoculated</HI> have done, he must unavoidably perish, and his <HI>Inoculator</HI> deem'd
<PB N="14" REF="002332_0017_0FDBC97D7A4D5E88">
guilty of wilful <HI>Poysoning.</HI> This is the Reason I sup|pose, why the Practitioners of <HI>Boston</HI> thought themselves not <HI>safe</HI> to venture on a Thing of such Consequence. Supposing only One in a Thousand should die of this Method, it cannot with Safety to the <HI>Inoculator</HI> be practis'd, without an Act of Parliam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&punc; exempting <HI>Ino|culation</HI> by a sworn Practitioner from the Penaltys of <HI>poy|soning</HI> and <HI>spreading Infection.</HI> I think <HI>B&mdash;n</HI>'s Friends should advise him to take his <HI>Tryal,</HI> while so many ju|dicious <HI>Magistrates</HI> and <HI>Ministers</HI> are in the Humour of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> lest any time hereafter, during his Natural Life, he be brought on his Tryal either on the KING's Account, or by the Relations.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Personal Testimonies of several Gentlemen who have been in the</HI> Levant (whereof some have been pub|lished in the Weekly News Letters) importing, that <HI>some Inoculated have dy'd under it</HI> (as we have lately seen several amongst ourselves) <HI>others have thereafter been miserable by its dismal Effects and Consequences; and some have had the</HI> Small Pox <HI>in the natural Way notwith|standing,</HI> But their Testimonies says Dr. <HI>C. M. are not worth a Straw</HI>; tho' in Case of any felonious Action a|gainst himself, they would be wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h his <HI>Neck</HI> in any Court of Justice.</P>
<P N="3">3. It seems agreeable to Reason, and the Experience we have of Distempers received by Contact, <HI>That by Inoculation, not only the</HI> Small Pox, <HI>but many other</HI> chro|nical Distempers <HI>(hereditary or acquired) of the person from whom the pocky Matter is received, are communicated to the person inoculated</HI>; for all <HI>Constitution D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stempers</HI> have some Tincture or <HI>Idea</HI> in every Drop of our Juices. The <HI>acute Distemper</HI> as such, from its Nature soon shows it self; but the chronical Ails, according to their Na|ture, act slowly and imperceptibly on our Bodys, and re|quire some Time before they become manifest All the Town knows, how little nice the <HI>Inoculator</HI> has been in procuring good wholsome Juice; not having many Pa|tients in the common Way, he was frequently obliged to have recourse to the <HI>Pus</HI> of the Inoculated; thus com|plicating
<PB N="15" REF="002332_0018_0FDBC97EF7915780">
the Constitution Distempers of Two or more Persons to be ingrafted on his Patients. I shall not en|quire, what becomes of the <HI>first Foeculency</HI> of several who have been inoculated more than once.</P>
<P>As in all <HI>Contagious</HI> Distempers, so in this the <HI>Fomes</HI> or Levain of the <HI>Disease,</HI> is something very fine and <HI>Sub|tile</HI>; What then becomes of the other <HI>gross foeculent</HI> part of this foreign <HI>Pus</HI> or Corruption <HI>ingrafted</HI>? In Reason one would be apt to think, that it may prove the <HI>Ferment</HI> or first <HI>Speck</HI> of some <HI>chronical putria A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l</HI>; the case being much different from that of the <HI>Pus</HI> of Impostumations and Ulcers <HI>proper,</HI> not malignant but accidental, which by daily experience we know may safely be received back into the same <HI>Mass of Blood</HI> from whence it did proceed, and afterwards thrown o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by some <HI>Emunctory.</HI></P>
<P>Some of their <HI>Incisions</HI> (even in those who can scarce be said to have had the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> the number of the <HI>Pusti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">les</HI> or Eruptions were so few and without <HI>Pus) run profusely,</HI> one, two, three or more Months after they go abroad; not in the manner of <HI>Suppuration, Digestion</HI> or wasting of the Substance in the Part; but by way <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll Discharge, Evacua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n,</HI> or <HI>Artificial Secretion</HI> from the habit of the <HI>Body,</HI> and that without the Interposition of any extraneous Body, as <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt, Tent,</HI> or <HI>Pea,</HI> to keep the Lips of the <HI>Incision</HI> from agglutinating, as in com|mon <HI>Issues</HI> is absolutely requisite, but meerly by the <HI>Vi|ciousness</HI> or Malignity of the Humour discharg'd, these <HI>Inoculated Issues</HI> are continued. Suppose by any <HI>In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m|pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es</HI> of Body (which the most healthy are liable to from the change of Weather, Diet, or other Accidents) the Juices are put into a hurry; this <HI>vicious S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">retion</HI> (as much as all other natural Secretions) is d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sturb'd for a Time, and the <HI>Malignant</HI> Humour either retain'd in the Blood, to the spoiling of the Habit; or in <HI>Vale|tudinary</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bjects (as do all other <HI>Fluxions</HI>) takes its course to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ome weak Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, <HI>v. g.</HI> to the <HI>Lungs</HI> of those whose Lungs are tender, to the <HI>Kidneys</HI> of the Gravelly or Diabetical, to the <HI>Head</HI> of those afflicted with Distem|pers

of the Head, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and consequently by its Malignity produce in those weak Parts either <HI>insensible Wastings</HI> or in due <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ime <HI>Exulcerations.</HI> This seems to account for the <HI>Subsequent Ails of the Inoculated</HI> publickly declared by some <HI>Gentlemen</HI> as above. As in some the <HI>Veneral Lues</HI> does not discover it self till afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> some Months or Years, so it may be with this LUES&punc; I am apt to think, that if this Practice be ever approved of, it may be advisable, to convert these Incisions into the Form of common Issues, to continue for some considerable Time. <HI>N. B.</HI> The <HI>Sores</HI> remaining after the worst Sore of <HI>natural</HI> Small Pox, heal as kindly as any other acci|dental Sore or Exulceration <HI>not malignant.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, whatever Ails and Diseases, especially <HI>chro|nical,</HI> the Inoculated in the after Course of their Life may be subject to; many of their Neighbours, and per|haps some of themselves, will be apt to lay the <HI>Blame</HI> on their former <HI>Inoculation</HI>; and so live in continual Anxie|ty and Disquietude of Mind, being for ever rendred inca|pable of enjoying that Perfection of Happiness in this Life, <HI>Mens sana in corpore sano.</HI> This I say may be the Case of some.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The rash and mischievous Methods used in propagating this practice.</HI> Instead of contriving Methods to secure the <HI>Inoculated</HI> from taking the Infection the common Way, and their Neighbours from being infected by them, they inoculate indifferently in all Corners, and set the Town all in a Flame in one Moment as it were; <HI>ma|ny perish</HI> who had the Infection from the Inoculated, whose Deaths perhaps <HI>in foro divino</HI> they may be found guilty of. Their Authors <HI>Timonius</HI> and <HI>Pylarinus</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell them, The Person who collects the Matter, ought not to apply it, least a <HI>double Infection</HI> ensue; and that the Advantage of this Practice is, that a <HI>suitable Season</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd a <HI>well prepared Body</HI> may be had to rencounter the In|fection; but these things, as trivial, they neglect, and run headlong as if push'd on by some <HI>Fury.</HI></P>
<P>How <HI>conscientiously</HI> do they tell us, that tho' it spread Infection, there may be Methods easily taken to prevent
<PB N="17" REF="002332_0020_0FDBC9822FD28208">
its hazarding others that do not yet come into it&punc; at the same Time before these Methods are taken or in the least endeavoured after, they lay all down they can <HI>proselyte.</HI> They do all they can to perswade the <HI>Country Towns</HI> to come into it, tho' they generally have escaped in <HI>former Small Pox Times,</HI> and the Winter coming on with the <HI>hard</HI> continued <HI>Frosts</HI> may stop its Progress. Suppose they compass their <HI>WICKED DESIRES,</HI> and <HI>One in Ten,</HI> which is more than can be expected to give into it (not above one in Fifty in <HI>Boston</HI> have been inoculated) in different Corners of the Town (for in their Scribles they lay down no Method of separating those from others) are <HI>inoculated,</HI> in a short time those infect all the Town, so as to have it the <HI>natural Way</HI>; with|out any Spirit of Prophecy by what we have seen of Small Pox Patients in the <HI>Country Towns</HI> one Third, per|haps one Half of the People will perish to the <HI>depopu|lating of His Majesty's good Province.</HI> The Reasons <HI>Au|thority</HI> may have to connive at this, I do not pretend to meddle with; but desire to be thankful to GOD, who in his wise Providence, seems to put a Stop to their Career, by the late <HI>Deaths</HI> of several Inoculated.</P>
<P>For <HI>Six Months</HI> past the Infection in <HI>Town</HI> has much kept off the <HI>Country</HI> from supplying us: The Town is now almost clear, and in a <HI>few Weeks</HI> those who fled might have return'd in Safety; but by the Inoculators <HI>Machinations,</HI> Inoculation or <HI>Infection</HI> is continued&punc; and we are kept <HI>in Statu quo</HI>: Nay further, to add to our Calamities, <HI>Roxbury</HI> the Thorough Fare to <HI>Boston,</HI> which hitherto had escaped, is now under Inoculation, and the <HI>Town's Supply</HI> more hindred than before.</P>
<P>One of the Mischiefs atending this Practice, is, <HI>Fa|mily Divisions and Heats.</HI> When GOD is pleased to take to himself some <HI>Relation, Servant</HI> or <HI>Slave</HI> in the natural Way, <HI>v. g.</HI> a Child; the Wife with Bitterness reflects on the Husbaad, telling him, Parson &mdash; says, <HI>Inoculation</HI> would have sav'd our dear Child. And how many afflict themselves, since wrought upon by the <HI>Inoculating Ministers,</HI> because of the Deaths of their near Relations? The late <HI>inoculated Deaths</HI> make these People more easy in their Minds. If Contentions arise

<P N="4">IV. A few Remarks on the Practice, and the manner of promoting it.</P>
<P>In a little <HI>vain Book,</HI> call'd <HI>Some Observations,</HI> &amp;c. the Author says, <HI>The Incisions moderate the first Fever</HI> (or Fever preceding the Eruption) tho' in most the Incisio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s or Issues do not run till the <HI>Pock</HI> appear, and then but inconsiderably; and they themselves during this Fever use <HI>Blisters</HI> more than we do in the common Way: <HI>And prevents the second Fever at the Turning,</HI> not considering that they whose <HI>Eruptions</HI> are few and favourable either way, can have no putrid Fever; those who are fuller have this putrid or second Fever from a return of so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the Pocky Matter into the Blood; it must then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irst return into the Blood, before it can come to vent it self at those Issues; so that at most it may <HI>moderate,</HI> but no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>prevent</HI> this second Fever; we find <HI>Vesicatorys</HI> or <HI>Blist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s</HI> answer the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ention better, by reason of the <HI>Stimulus,</HI> inclining the noxious Humours to the Places of Vent.</P>
<P>The same <HI>Inoculator</HI> in another Place says, certainly the <HI>Issues</HI> (Incisions) <HI>smell,</HI> more or less, according to the Degree of the Distemper, and in the confluent Kind <HI>this Discharge is more noisome,</HI> like the running of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he fluxy Kind, which he all along represents as the most putrid corrupted thing imaginable. A little before this he says, <HI>When the Patient is fullest under the Inoculation, I affirm I could never smell their issues,</HI> no not when I have lean'd over their Beds on purpose <HI>to do it.</HI> His <HI>Lucubra|tions</HI> or Night Labours in favour of Inoculation occasion'd his <HI>great Cold,</HI> or we must put a worse Costruction on such Contradictions asserted almost with the same Breath.</P>
<P>It is commonly said, that <HI>the Inoculated smell stronger</HI> than those in the natural Way and same degree; this I do not insist upon, tho' the <HI>additional stench</HI> of their <HI>running Sores</HI> or Incisi|ons and <HI>putrify'd Cabbage Leaf,</HI> one would think, should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Senses more.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="002332_0022_0FDBC9889CA7E448">To say, <HI>we understand no more of the Small Pox now than we did Forty Three Years ago,</HI> is a <HI>saucy Imputation</HI> on the many noble and useful Improvements in Physick since that time. Have Dr. <HI>Sydenham, Morton,</HI> and other late ingenious <HI>practical Writers</HI> on the Small Pox, whose Writings we daily peruse, done noth|ing to the Satisfa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion of this learned and pious Gentleman&punc; His many <HI>physical Blunders</HI> are forgive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; because he matter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not if he has b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tray'd his <HI>Ignorance</HI> therein; he writes with another Design, <HI>viz. Per <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us et nefos,</HI> at any Rate to perswade to <HI>Inoculation.</HI></P>
<P>In the beginning of the Small Pox, they pray <HI>God may put a stop to its spreading,</HI> and at the same time do all they can to <HI>propagate it by Inoculation,</HI> which is equally infectious as in the natural Way; some say <HI>more contagious,</HI> because after the Eruptions are dry'd up, the Inoculated walk about with their <HI>Issues</HI> running a kind of <HI>variolus</HI> Matter. (<HI>N. B.</HI> If any of them are found in mixt Assemblies or in Country Towns, while in this Condition, the Law of Nature and Self Preservation seems to require the Discipline for mad Dogs.) In one part of Pray|er to <HI>thank God for the Discovery,</HI> and a little after to pray con|ditionally, <HI>that if it be not of God he may put a stop to it</HI>; with many other such Expressions in their Prayers, which in my humble Opinion, seem to be a <HI>mocking of God,</HI> and an <HI>Abuse on their Hearers,</HI> whereof the greatest Part are against procuring of Self-Illness. What shall a Man do in such Cases? go to wor|ship where he cannot join in Prayer with the Minister? This has been a stumbling Block to some, and is much to the dis|credit of <HI>extemporary Prayers,</HI> where all is left to the <HI>Parson</HI>'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Discr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion.</HI></P>
<P>If the Inoculators had designed a publick Good, why did they run headlong unto it, without observing the <HI>Circumstances</HI> and <HI>Cautions</HI> which might have made it useful; to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gin in the Heart of the Town, where was no Infection; to inoculate all <HI>Ages</HI> and <HI>Constitutions</HI> from the very Beginning, without being first assur'd of it's Success on the <HI>Young and Healthy.</HI> Why did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey not <HI>petition the Government,</HI> that none should be inoculated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll his Name was recorded, that for the publick Good <HI>in times to come,</HI> it might be known who dy'd, and what <HI>state of Health</HI> they afterwards enjoy'd who surviv'd; as also have contriv'd some Method, that none might take the Infection from the <HI>Inocu|lated</HI>: This Neglect has occasioned the Death of many.</P>
<P>I am sorry the World cannot reap that Benefit from this rash and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old Experiment that might have been expected; <HI>The chief Promoter, who sends Accounts Home not always to be depended upon, is credulous and whimsical; the Operator is rash and un|thinking</HI>: Who knows but they who have dyed or suffered much under Inoculation, if they had had better Management, might have had <HI>better Fate.</HI></P>

1. <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the</HI> Small Pox <HI>may sometimes be communicated by Ino|culation.</HI> I cannot say always, because some have been Inoculated more than once before it wrought; and many have from thence had only a sort of <HI>eruptive Fever,</HI> but no genuine Small Pox, so far as I am able to judge. 2. <HI>That the</HI> Small Pox <HI>so acquired, is frequently more favourable than in the common way of Infecti|on, and not altogether so mortal</HI>: What the dismal Consequen|ces may be, I shall not pretend to determine; but Reason and the Testimonies of some Gentlemen from the <HI>Levant,</HI> give us ground to <HI>suspect.</HI> 3. <HI>That not one of the inoculated during the space of five or six Months has had the</HI> Small Pox <HI>in the natural way,</HI> so far as we know; for the Inoculators in every thing that makes against them, by <HI>LYES</HI> and <HI>EQUIVOCATIONS</HI> endea|vour to keep us in the dark. It is then a <HI>palliative Prevention</HI> of the Small Pox for some time, and not <HI>very mortal</HI>; and con|sequently may be of great Use to the <HI>Guinea Traders,</HI> when the Small Pox gets among their Slaves aboard to inoculate the whole Cargo, and patch them up for a <HI>Market</HI>; as is already the Practice with them in the other Pox or <HI>Yaws,</HI> by some <HI>slight, palliative Cure</HI> to fit them up for a quick Market, tho' to the <HI>great Damage</HI> of the next <HI>Purchasers.</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>Dismal Consequences</HI> do not discourage us, by a <HI>vitiated Constitution</HI> of the <HI>Inoculated</HI> and their <HI>Progeny</HI>; who knows but this may be so improved upon, as to become a <HI>Specifick Pre|ventive of the Small Pox,</HI> but it must first be allowed of by <HI>Act</HI> of the <HI>Legislature</HI> (the spreading of infection I am afraid will notwithstanding render it odious) &amp; prosecuted by abler hands, than <HI>Greek old Women, Madmen and Fools.</HI> And further, sup|posing the Consequences be such as our <HI>Declarants</HI> say, we may proceed to try, if a Salivation or Antomonial, or Sulph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rine Course, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may not totally carry off the remnant Foeculency: That is, Whether <HI>Inoculation,</HI> with a subsequent <HI>Salivation,</HI> &amp;c. may not be an adaequate <HI>Succedaneum</HI> to the <HI>genuine Small Pox.</HI></P>
<P>As a Caution to a certain <HI>Gentleman,</HI> (who you know in times past has been troublesome to the R.

<P>I impatiently wait for some further Account of its Progress in London, their Cautions and Rules in the Procedure, I hope may be of Use to us. For my own Part <HI>till after a few Years, I shall pass no positive Iudgment of this bold Practice.</HI></P>
