<HEAD>Directions to Read and Spell truly.</HEAD>
<P>OBserve, that the first Letter of all proper Names and beginning of Sentences are to be greater Letters.</P>
<P>A Dipthong is the sounding of any two or more Vowels together, without any Conso|nant between them: they are commonly used in Words of one Syllable, there are nine Dip|thongs.</P>
<P>ai, or ay, as in maid, may</P>
<P>au, or aw, as Laud, Law.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="001049_0060_0FAEF533D3E13FA8">ea, as earth.</P>
<P>ee, as seed.</P>
<P>ei, as heir.</P>
<P>eu, or ew, as feud, grew,</P>
<P>oi, or oy, as coi, boy, joy.</P>
<P>oo, as good.</P>
<P>ou, or ow, as loud, low.</P>
<P>A Consonant is a Letter that maketh a sound with a Vowel.</P>
<P>A Syllable is a perfect sound, made some|times of Vowels only, and sometimes of Vow|els and Consonants; no Syllable hath above eight Letters in it, as <HI>Strength,</HI> neither hath any Word above seven Syllables in the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, as <HI>Re-con-ci li a ti on.</HI></P>
<P>Observe how many Vowels there are in a Word so many Syllables it hath in it, as in <HI>Re con-ci li a ti on,</HI> except the Word end in <HI>e</HI> or <HI>es,</HI> as in <HI>have</HI> and <HI>Iames</HI>; or if there be a Dipthong in it, as in <HI>may</HI> or <HI>your</HI>: after o is always <HI>u</HI> with another Vowel, as in <HI>quick.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>After true Spelling, these seven Points are to be observed in Reading, for keeping the Sence.</HEAD>
<P>(,) A <HI>Comma</HI> is a little stop or breathing; as, <HI>Behold O Lord,</HI></P>
<P>(;) A. <HI>Semi colon</HI> is a longer stop or breath|ing; as <HI>for I am in distress</HI>;</P>
<P>(:) A <HI>Colon</HI> is commonly put in the middle of a Sentence; as, <HI>my bowels are troubled:
<PB N="61" REF="001049_0061_0FAEF53487BA0700">
my Heart is turned within me, for I haue grie|uously rebelled.</HI></P>
<P>(.) A <HI>Period</HI> is a full stop, and is put af|ter a full Sentence; as, <HI>Abroad the Sword, bereaueth, at home there is a Dearth.</HI></P>
<P>() A <HI>Parenthesis</HI> is when some Words may be left out, and yet the Sentence perfect; as, <HI>For I know that in me (that is in my Flesh) dwelleth no good Thing</HI>&mdash;for his Letters (say they) are weighty and powerful, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>(?) An <HI>Interrogation</HI> is put always after a Question asked? as, <HI>Is Christ divided? Was</HI> Paul <HI>crucified for you</HI>? or, <HI>Were you baptized in the Name of</HI> Paul?</P>
<P>(!) An <HI>Admiration</HI> is a Note of Wondring or crying out; as, <HI>O the depth of the Riches both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God! How un|searchable are his ways and his judgment past finding out!</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Significations of divers Words commonly used, but hard to be understood.</HEAD>
<P><HI>BIble,</HI> (Greek) containing several Books. <HI>Evangelist,</HI> (Greek) a bringer of glad Tidings, a Preacher of the Gospel.</P>
<P><HI>Ephemerides</HI> (Greek) Journals, or Books wherein <HI>daily Actions</HI> are registred, also Astro|nomical Calculation.</P>
<P><HI>Epact,</HI> A ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">tain number of daies, by which the <HI>Solary</HI> Year exceedeth the <HI>Lunary,</HI> which number of Excess is eleven, in regard the <HI>Lu|nary</HI> consisting but of 29 days, and one and a half maketh but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">4 daies in a year, whereas the <HI>Solary</HI> Year hath 365 days and a quarter: For the Equation of which Years differing thus eleven days, certain days are yearly sup|plied by the Epact, never exceeding 30 (be|cause the days between change and change of the Moon never exceed that number) until a thirteen Month be added, whereby every third year becomes <HI>Embolismal,</HI> being a <HI>Lunary</HI> Leap year.</P>
<P><HI>Embolism,</HI> (Greek) signifieth a casting in of the day which is added to the Leap year.</P>
<P>To find out the <HI>Epact</HI> of each year, do thus; To the <HI>Epact</HI> of the last year add 11&middot; and the sum of these two make the <HI>Epact,</HI> if it sur|mount 30 then take 30 out, and that which rests above 30 is the <HI>Epact</HI> for that year.</P>
<P>To know the age of the Moon by the <HI>Epact</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="001049_0102_0FAEF43588C1A748">
without an <HI>Almnack</HI>; add the days of the Month wherein thou wouldst know the <HI>Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct</HI>; and as many daies more as are Months from the first Month called <HI>March,</HI> to that Month, including both Months, out of the which substract 30 as often as may be, the age re|maineth; if nothing remain, the Moon chang|eth that day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Golden Number,</HI> so called; because it was written in the Kalender with Letters of Gold, right at the day whereon the Moon changed; and it is the space of 19 Years in which the Moon returneth to the self same day of the Year of the Sun, and therefore is called <HI>the Circle of the Moon,</HI> in the which the <HI>Solstices and Equinoctials</HI> return to all one point in the <HI>Zodiack.</HI></P>
<P>To find it every Year, add one Year to the Year of Christ, then divide the whole by 19, and that which resteth is the <HI>Golden Number</HI> for that Year, if there be no Surplusage, it is then 19.</P>
<P>Note, That the <HI>Golden Number</HI> and <HI>Domi|nical Letter</HI> doth change every year the first day of the eleventh Month, and the <HI>Epact</HI> the first day of the first Month for ever; and the Year always begins the twenty fifth of the first Month.</P>
