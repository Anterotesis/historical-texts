<HEAD>A VINDICATION Of GOD's sovereign free Grace: in some REMARKS upon Mr. <HI>Iohn Beach</HI>'s SER|MON, from <HI>Rom.</HI> vi.23. intitled, <HI>A SERMON</HI> shewing that eternal Life is GOD's free Gift, bestowed upon Men according to their moral Behaviour.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Beach</HI> enters upon this Discourse with a sur|prizing Confidence; and in Effect represents all those to be either <HI>Fools</HI> or <HI>Knaves,</HI> or both, who differ from him in the Sentiments, which he here espouses.
<Q>Whether (says he) it be through <HI>Weakness,</HI> or <HI>Perverseness,</HI> or both, I can't deter|mine; but it is notorious, that there is such a <HI>Distinction</HI> kept between those who pretend to be Preachers of the Gospel, as that one Sort are stiled Exalters of <HI>Free-Will,</HI> the other are called the Preachers of <HI>Free-Grace:</HI> As if <HI>Free-Grace</HI> and <HI>Free-Will</HI> were directly <HI>contrary</HI> to each other.</Q>
&mdash; A bold Stroke this, against all those who <HI>keep this Distinction,</HI> &amp;c. But <HI>who</HI> are these?&mdash; If it should appear upon Examination, that the <HI>Church of England,</HI> to whose Liturgy Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> has declared his hearty Assent and Consent, and whose Articles he has subscribed, do teach the very Doctrine that here stands indicted with <HI>Weakness</HI> or <HI>Perverseness</HI>; and that too i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> direct and express Opposition to the Scheme of Principles laid down by him in this Sermon; he must appear but in a very indifferent Figure as a Clergy-man of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> un|der Vows and Subscriptions to her Formula's, while eating her Bread, and lifting up his Heel against her Doctrines. &mdash; If it should further appear, that all the <HI>Protestant</HI> Churches, without one
<PB REF="005761_0004_0000000000000000">
Exception, agree with the <HI>Church of England</HI> in the same doctri|nal Articles of Religion, and teach as the <HI>Church of England</HI> does, the Contrariety between <HI>Free-Will</HI> and <HI>Free-Grace,</HI> and do directly contradict the very Scheme of Principles laid down by Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> in this Sermon; I can't envy him his Character of a <HI>protestant Minister,</HI> while directly and publickly opposing all the protestant Churches, in some of the most important Articles of their Faith. &mdash; If it should also appear that Mr. <HI>Beach's</HI> mannerly Sarcasm does not stop here, but extends to the sacred <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and that his Doc|trines are directly opposite to the <HI>Oracles of God,</HI> his Character of a <HI>Christian</HI> must be recommended by something better than this Performance; or else it will appear in as dark a View, as his Character of a <HI>Churchman,</HI> or a <HI>Protestant.</HI> &mdash; And once more, if Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> himself, in this very Sermon, has set <HI>Free-Grace</HI> and <HI>Free-Will</HI> in Opposition and Contrariety one to the other; and has most inconsistently treated upon the Subject in View, he must then at least share with the rest of the christian World, in the fine Compliment, he is pleased to give both himself and them.</P>
<P>If all these Things can be made appear (as I am pretty sure they can) there will nothing more be needful to be offered in Answer to this Sermon, but to obviate his plausible <HI>Objections</HI> against the Doctrines which he so confidently opposes: except a serious Address to those who espouse and propagate these his Principles, be thought proper and seasonable.</P>
<P>I am first to consider, whether the <HI>Church of England</HI> don't teach the very same Doctrines, which Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> thus treats with Disdain and Contempt.&mdash; That I may set this Matter in a proper Light, I will exhibit the Articles of the <HI>Church of England</HI> in one Column, and Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Doctrine in another; that the Reader may, in one View, behold the Conformity of his Principles to the Articles, unto which he is bound by such sacred Ties.</P>

<P>Now this distinguishing Mercy of being translated out of the Kingdom of Satan, into the King|dom of Jesus Christ, and enjoying the Privileges of the Gospel, is that <HI>Election of Grace,</HI> which so often occurs in the New Testa|ment.&mdash; Now in that God has distinguished Christians from all the rest of Mankind, by making us his peculiar People, therefore all Christians are the <HI>Elect,</HI> the <HI>Elec|tion of Grace,</HI> and <HI>Vessels of Mercy.</HI> &mdash; Which is affirm'd of all Chri|stians

So that ac|cording to the Language of the Holy Scripture, every one of us Christians belong to the Election of God's Grace: Yet notwith|standing, we shall perish, if we do not walk worthy of God's elect|ing Love. Hence St. <HI>Peter</HI> exhorts Christians, to <HI>give Diligence to make their Calling and Election sure.</HI> Which cannot be meant of an ab|solute personal Election: for IF THERE BE SUCH A THING, it is not in our Power to make it surer and firmer, than God has already made it.

<P>When Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> can fairly reconcile this Doctrine of his to the XVIIth Article of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which he has subscribed, and according to which he is obliged to preach, I here give him my Promise to reconcile the greatest Contradictions that he can devise, and to prove by the same Way of Reasoning which he uses to that Purpose, that Light and Darkness, Life and Death, Holiness and Sin, are the same Thing.</P>

<P>I think, I may now refer it to the Reader, and even to Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> himself, whether I han't given full and plain Documents of the express Contrariety of this Discourse of his, to the Doctrines of the Church of <HI>England</HI>: But after all, if this be not sufficient, I have much more to offer, when it shall be called for. And shall now only add, that <HI>whoever affirm the</HI> XXXIX <HI>Articles to be in Part erroneous,</HI> are <HI>ipso Facto</HI> excommunicated by the Vth <HI>Canon</HI> of the <HI>Church of England.</HI></P>
<P>I am next to consider, whether all the <HI>Protestant</HI> Churches do not unitedly agree with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in the Doctrines under Consideration; and expresly oppose the Principles so confidently taught by Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> in this Sermon.</P>
<P>It would indeed be too tedious a Work for me, to transcribe the several <HI>Confessions</HI> of all the reformed Churches.

<P>I shall however, endeavour to give a brief View of Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Opposition to the Judgment of the reformed Churches, by shewing how these Doctrines of his were condemned by them, when they were by their Delegates conveen'd for that Purpose, at the <HI>Synod of</HI> DORT.&mdash; There the Delegates of the several Churches (and of the Church of <HI>England</HI> among the rest) separately gave in their Suffrages, in direct Opposition to Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Doctrine: And there they all unitedly stated and represented in a true Scripture-Light the Doctrines of <HI>special Grace</HI>; and then proceeded to detect and condemn the contrary <HI>Errors.</HI>&mdash; It will be sufficient to my present Purpose, to exhibit in one Column some of those Things <HI>condemned by them all as dangerous Errors</HI>; and to exhibit in the opposite Column, the same Errors taught by Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> in this Sermon of his.</P>

<P>The Reason why any are not converted and saved, is because they don't concur and co-operate with divine Grace. For when God works in us, he does not work irresistably; for in that Case we could not forbear to work out our own Salvation. But the Holy Ghost works so in us, that we may chuse whether we will work with him, or against him. We can at the same Time, either quench or cherish the Spirit. We can either resist or comply with the Holy Ghost; and according as we do either of these, so we shall be sav|ed or damned. So that if we are converted, it is of Grace; and if we remain wicked, it is because we abuse Grace, when we could do otherwise. (Pag. 20.)</P>

<P>I might in many other Instances have shewn the direct Contra|riety of Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Discourse, to the Doctrine of the reformed Churches in this their Convention: But what is already said, is a suf|ficient Document to every one, that will open his Eyes, how well the Man deserves the Character of a <HI>Protestant Minister,</HI> who teaches such Principles as are here found in Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Sermon.&mdash; I shall therefore add no more from this <HI>Synod,</HI> but a Paragraph or two out of their concluding <HI>Exhortation</HI>; which, it concerns Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> and those who join with him in these <HI>Pelagian</HI> Doctrines, and in his bold Invectives against the established Principles of the Protestant Churches, seriously to attend to.&mdash;
<Q>This (says the <HI>Synod</HI>) is a plain, simple and inge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uous Declaration of the Orthodox Doctrine concerning the <HI>five Articles,</HI> controverted in <HI>Holland</HI>; and a Re|jection of those Errors, with which the Church of <HI>Holland</HI> has been for some Time disturbed, which the <HI>Synod</HI> judges to be ta|ken from the Word of God, and agreeable to the Confessions of the reformed Churches.

<P>Now this distinguishing Mercy, of being translated out of the Kingdom of Satan into the King|dom of Jesus Christ, and enjoying the Privileges of the Gospel, is that <HI>Election</HI> of Grace, that so of|ten occurs in the New-Testament. Now in that God has distinguished Christians from all the rest of Man|kind, by making us his peculiar People, therefore all Christians are the <HI>Elect, the Election</HI> of Grace, and <HI>Vessels of Mercy</HI>: As the Is|raelites were once the elect People of God. (Page 12.) &mdash; So that according to the Language of the holy Scripture, every one of us Christians belong to the Election of God's free Grace: Yet not|withstanding, we shall perish, if we don't walk worthy of electing Love.

<P><PB N="15" REF="005761_0013_0000000000000000">The following Reflections are open to every one's Observation. If all the <HI>Elect</HI> were <HI>chosen before the Foundation of the World, that they should be holy and without Blame before God in Love,</HI> then all professing Christians are not the <HI>Elect</HI>; for it's evident, that they are not all (ever in their Lives) <HI>holy and without Blame.</HI>&mdash; This Consequence is necessary, unless God's eternal Purpose, that the <HI>Elect</HI> should be holy, be mutable and precarious; which, I hope, none will venture to suppose.</P>
<P>Again, If the Predestinate have the <HI>Adoption of God's Children by Iesus Christ,</HI> and <HI>are made accepted in the Beloved,</HI> as the Text as|sures us they are; then all professed Christians and Gospel-Enjoyers are not of the <HI>Election of Grace,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> supposes. For all professed Christians are not God's adopted Children, nor accepted in the Beloved.</P>
<P>Moreover, If the <HI>Vessels of Mercy</HI> are <HI>afore prepared unto Glory,</HI> as the quoted Text assures us they are; then all professed Chri|stians and Gospel-Enjoyers are not <HI>Vessels of Mercy,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> tells us they be. For all these certainly are not prepared unto Glory.</P>
<P>I add, <HI>If all Things work together for Good, to them who are called according to God's Purpose,</HI> as the Text assures us; then all that enjoy the Privileges of the Gospel, are not the <HI>Elect,</HI> nor <HI>called according to God's Purpose.</HI> For many Gospel-Professors have by their Wickedness provoked God to leave them to themselves; are going on in their Sins; and laying a Foundation of most aggravated Misery and Ruin in the End.</P>
<P>Furthermore, If all <HI>whom God did foreknow,</HI> were <HI>predestinated to be conformed to the Image of his Son,</HI> and are <HI>called,</HI> and <HI>justified,</HI> and will be <HI>glorified,</HI> as the Text assures us, then all who enjoy the Privileges of the Gospel, are not the <HI>Elect</HI>: Nor are the <HI>Elect</HI> liable to pe|rish, by walking unworthy of <HI>electing</HI> Love, as Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> suggests. For all such are not conformed to the Image of God's Son, are not called and justified, nor will all such be glorified.&mdash; Neither can it be true, that they who are called and justified, and shall finally be glorified, can walk unworthy of electing Love, so as to perish.</P>
<P>Once more, If there can be <HI>nothing laid to the Charge of God's Elect,</HI> since <HI>God justifies them</HI>; and <HI>nothing can separate them from the Love of Christ</HI>; but they shall be <HI>in all Things more than Con|querors,</HI> as we are assured by the Text, then all Gospel-Professors are not the <HI>Elect.</HI> For there can be much laid to the Charge of many of them; God does not justify them; and they are sepa|rated from the Love of Christ.&mdash; It also follows, that the <HI>Elect</HI> can|not continue to walk so unworthy of electing Love, as to perish. For they that perish, are separated from the Love of Christ; and are not more than Conquerors.</P>
<P>I venture to say, that it's utterly impossible, fairly to reconcile these plain and manifest Contradictions, between the cited Text<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>If God is not willing to give all Men sufficient Grace, I cannot conceive how he can truly be said to be willing and desirous that they should turn and live. (P. 19.) &mdash; Without supposing that sufficient Grace is afforded to all, I cannot possibly understand the Sense of that Expostulation, <HI>Isa.</HI> v.3, 4.

<P>Thus we are plainly taught, that <HI>no Man can come</HI> to Christ till he be <HI>drawn of the Father, and it be given him from above,</HI> i. e. till God determines his Will and Choice; and yet that there is in every one a <HI>Freedom of Will,</HI> and a <HI>Power to determine his own Will and Choice,</HI> by which he can <HI>comply with,</HI> or <HI>reject</HI> the Sug|gestions of the <HI>Holy Spirit.&mdash; It is GOD who works in us both to will and to do</HI>: And yet we have this <HI>self-moving Principle</HI> in our very CONSTITUTION.&mdash;Are not these Contradictions!</P>

<P>Thus <HI>our Acceptance</HI> of Grace when offered, is <HI>All,</HI> and <HI>Nothing,</HI> which we do towards our Salvation. We are saved <HI>only</HI> by our <HI>accepting offered Grace</HI>; and yet <HI>no other Way,</HI> but by our <HI>obeying</HI> the Gospel, by our moral and christian <HI>Vertues,</HI> by a faithful <HI>Obedience.</HI>&mdash; Is not here a palpable Inconsistency!</P>
<P>This is a sufficient Exemplication of the perfect and harmonious Agreement of <HI>Free-Grace</HI> and <HI>Free-Will,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> boasts of: by which, I think, every one will own, that he himself must take his Part of the mannerly Compliment, wherewith he began his Discourse.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to take some particular Notice of Mr. BEACH'S <HI>Arguments</HI> against the Doctrines of <HI>special Grace</HI>; and consider what Evidence he brings in Confirmation of his own Schemes.</P>
<P>His first Attempt is to prove <HI>universal Redemption,</HI> in the strong|est and strictest Sense; from whence (I conclude) he would infer the harmonious Agreement of <HI>Free-Grace</HI> and <HI>Free-Will.</HI>
<Q>Our Redemption by Jesus Christ is (he tells us) the Gift and Effect of God's Mercy.&mdash; And this redeeming Grace is so free, that it is not confined nor restrain'd to an elect Number: but comprehends the <HI>whole</HI> Race of <HI>Adam.</HI>&mdash; As it is frequently and most expresly asserted in the holy Scriptures. <HI>He died for all, he tasted Death for every Man, he is the Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World.</HI></Q>
(Pag. 6, &amp;c.)</P>
<P>In Answer to this, I freely allow, that Christ has died for all Men, in such a Sense as that every Individual of the human Race may, by Vertue of the Ransom paid by him, obtain eternal Life, upon Faith in his Blood. &mdash; And that the Gospel-Invita|tion is indefinite, putting no Difference between <HI>Iew</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> Male and Female, Bond and Free; but that <HI>every one</HI> without Distinction is freely invited in the Word, and ought to be invited in the Ministry of the Word, to come to Christ, and believe in him, with a full Assurance, that upon his so doing, he should not fail of a Title to eternal Life.&mdash; And hence it is always true, with Respect to every Person, who remains impenitent under the Gospel, that the immediate Reason why he continues and perishes
<PB N="22" REF="005761_0020_0000000000000000">
in his Sins, is only because <HI>he will not come to Christ, that he might have Life.</HI>&mdash; All this seems to be fully asserted in the Scriptures; by which it plainly appears, that Gospel-Sinners <HI>have no Cloak for their</HI> Rejection of Christ and his offered Salvation. Universal Re|demption is never taught us in Scripture, in any other Sense than this.</P>
<P>But then the Question yet remains, whether Christ has not in some <HI>special</HI> and peculiar Sense died for the <HI>Elect?</HI> Whether he has not only died to purchase for these the Privilege, that they shall be <HI>saved, if they believe</HI>; but also to purchase for and to bestow upon them that <HI>Faith,</HI> whereby they certainly <HI>may</HI> and <HI>will believe,</HI> and be saved?&mdash; Or in other Words, whether he has not undertaken <HI>efficaciously</HI> to bestow <HI>Grace</HI> upon the Elect, whereby they shall be united to him, be justified and sanctified thro' Faith in him, be enabled to live a Life of Holiness, and thereby be qua|lified for future Salvation, with eternal Glory?&mdash; And whether the blessed Redeemer has undertaken to bestow all these Benefits and Privileges upon the <HI>rest of the World,</HI> in the same Manner as upon the Elect?&mdash; In short, whether this Salvation, altho' it be call'd <HI>the common Salvation,</HI> be call'd so in such a Sense as that we must conceive it equally intended for <HI>all</HI> Men?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> can't be ignorant, that this is the true State of the Controversy: and that it has been the received Doctrine of all the reformed Churches, that in this Sense the Lord Jesus Christ has not wrought out the same Redemption for the <HI>rest of the World,</HI> as he has wrought out for the <HI>Elect.</HI>&mdash; This Gentleman however, in direct Opposition to them all (as I have already shewn) teaches the quite contrary Doctrine.&mdash; And if we understand the Words under Consideration, as being consistent with the rest of his Discourse, and pertinent to his Purpose, they must imply, that <HI>this redeeming Grace is so free, that it is not</HI> (in any of its distinguishing Benefits) <HI>confined or restrained to an elect Number: but</HI> (in the same Manner, in all Respects) <HI>comprehends the whole Race of</HI> Adam.&mdash; This therefore is now to be consider'd.</P>
<P>And I shall first take some Notice of what Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> offers, in Confirmation of his Principles.
<Q>And as it is (says he) frequently and most expresly asserted in Scripture, <HI>He died for all, He tasted Death for every Man, He is the Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World.</HI> Now if such Expressions as <HI>the World, the whole World, all and every Man,</HI> be allow'd to mean not all indeed, nor the greatest Part, but only a small Number selected from all Sorts of Men, who do actually obtain eternal Salvation; then the Holy Ghost with the same Propriety might have asserted, that the <HI>whole World</HI> should be saved, and that all and <HI>every Man</HI> should obtain eternal Happiness.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="005761_0021_0000000000000000">To this I first answer, as above, that I doubt not but the Re|demption by Christ is of <HI>sufficient Value</HI> for every individual Child of <HI>Adam</HI>; so sufficient, that <HI>every one</HI> of them shall surely obtain Salvation, by Vertue of that Redemption, who exercise a true and lively Faith in Christ: And that <HI>every one</HI> under Gospel-Light has a <HI>sufficient Warrant</HI> to <HI>believe</HI> in Christ for eternal Salvation: And therefore, that there is nothing at all to hinder their being saved thro' Faith in Christ, but their own indulged Corruption, and wilful and obstinate Choice.&mdash; But such is the dreadful Case of a sinful World, that even Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> himself allows (p. 15.) <HI>No Man will ever come to Christ and accept of his kind Offer, unless the Father draw him, and it be given him from above.</HI> Whence it follows, that no Man will ever be saved by this general Grace or universal Re|demption, because no Man will (by Vertue thereof) ever comply with the Terms proposed in the Gospel. &mdash; Though this general Redemption puts all Men under a Capacity of <HI>Salvation,</HI> upon <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ: Yet inasmuch as such is the natural <HI>Opposition</HI> of all Men to the Terms of the Gospel, that no Man ever did, or ever will comply with the Gospel-Offer, without <HI>special</HI> and <HI>distinguish|ing Grace,</HI> whereby they are <HI>made willing in the Day of the Me|diator's Power</HI>; it is certain, that <HI>no Man</HI> will ever get to Hea|ven, who is not Partaker of a more special Redemption (whe|ther in Point of Impetration or Application) than <HI>the World</HI> in ge|neral are Partakers of: As will be more particularly explain'd, before I dismiss this Subject.</P>
<P>But then, I have this further Remark upon Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Rea|soning; that the Scripture does in Fact assert the <HI>Application</HI> of the Redemption by Christ, to the <HI>World,</HI> in the same Manner, and in the same universal Terms, as it asserts the <HI>Impetration</HI> of it. His boast|ed Argument can therefore afford him no Conclusion at all. &mdash; This is very apparent, from the following Texts of Scripture. 2 Cor. v.19. <HI>God was in Christ reconciling the</HI> WORLD <HI>unto himself; not imputing their Trespasses.</HI>&mdash;Col. i.20. <HI>And having made Peace by the Blood of his Cross, by him to reconcile</HI> ALL THINGS <HI>to himself.</HI>&mdash; Joh. vi.33. <HI>For the Bread of God is he which cometh down from Heaven, and giveth Life unto the</HI> WORLD. &mdash; Rom. v.18. <HI>Even so by the Righteousness of one, the free Gift came upon</HI> ALL MEN <HI>unto Iustification of</HI> LIFE.&mdash; Joh. i.29. <HI>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sin of the</HI> WORLD.&mdash;Joh. xii.32. <HI>And I, if I be lifted up from the Earth, will draw</HI> ALL MEN <HI>unto me.</HI> &mdash; Since these and such like Texts of Scripture must have a limited Construction, it belongs to Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> to give a Reason, why the Texts cited by him, are not to be understood with the same Li|mitations. &mdash; This Remark will be further corroborated by observ|ing, that the Scripture not only every where considers the <HI>Appli|cation</HI> of special Redemption to be of the same Extent with the <HI>Purchase</HI> of it, but shews us, that the former is a necessary Fruit
<PB N="24" REF="005761_0022_0000000000000000">
and Consequence of the latter. Thus, Rom. viii.32. <HI>He that spar|ed not his own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all Things?</HI>&mdash; Joh. x.11, 16. <HI>I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd giveth his Life for the Sheep.&mdash; And other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold: them also I must bring in; and they shall hear my Voice.</HI>&mdash; Joh. vi.37, 39. <HI>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me. &mdash; And this is the Father's Will, that of</HI> ALL <HI>which he hath given me, I should lose</HI> NOTHING; <HI>but should raise it up again at the last Day.</HI></P>
<P>Now let Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Argument be turn'd upon himself; and what Answer soever he is pleased to give to it, may with like Propriety and Force be given to all that he has offered upon this Head.
<Q>Now if such Expressions, as God's reconciling the WORLD to himself in Christ, as reconciling ALL THINGS to himself by the Blood of the Cross, as that Christ giveth Life to the WORLD, as his bestowing upon ALL MEN Justification of Life, and his drawing ALL MEN to him, &amp;c, be allowed to mean, that <HI>not all</HI> indeed, nor the greatest Part, but only a small Number selected from all Sorts of Men,</Q>
are actually re|conciled to God, justified, and made Partakers of eternal Life; then it can't be proved from the Use of the same, or like Expressions with Relation to Christ's purchasing of Redemption by his Death, that every individual Person is effectually redeemed thereby. &mdash; Moreover, If God will freely give all Things, to all those for whom his Son was delivered up; if those Sheep for whom Christ gave his Life, must be brought in, and shall hear his Voice; if ALL shall come to him, and he will lose NOTHING, that was given him to be re|deemed, but will raise them ALL up at the last Day; then it fol|lows, that all those whom Christ has redeemed by his Death, all those who were given to him by the Father to be redeemed, and for whom he undertook to work out an effectual Redemption, shall be eventually or actually and eternally saved; and the Application of Christ's Redemption does undoubtedly extend to every individual Person, whom he has undertaken to redeem and save.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> argues,
<Q>If <HI>Redemption</HI> is as much confined as <HI>eter|nal Salvation,</HI> and Christ died for none who do <HI>perish,</HI> it is certainly as proper to say, that all Men shall be eternally happy, as that Christ died for all.</Q>
&mdash; To which I answer, he sees that the Scriptures do say the one as much as the other; and there|fore, that they are both proper to be spoken, in the same Sense, and in the same Extent. And he can give no Reason, why the latter should not be as strictly and literally understood, as the former. &mdash;And thus all his Arguments on this Head, must necessarily fall to the Ground.&mdash; Upon the whole then it appears, that in what|ever Sense we understand such Expressions of the sacred Scriptures, as that <HI>Christ died for all, tasted Death for every Man, &amp;c.</HI> it must
<PB N="25" REF="005761_0023_0000000000000000">
be acknowledged, that he designed to, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill actually, bestow eternal <HI>Salvation</HI> upon all the Subjects of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> special Redemption. &mdash; In what Sense he died for all, and in what Sense the Elect only are the Subjects of his special Redemption, I have spoken something already; but am now to speak more particularly.</P>
<P>In Order to set this in a proper Light, I proceed in the next Place to consider&punc; whether Christ has <HI>equally</HI> and <HI>indifferently</HI> re|deem'd the <HI>whole</HI> Race of <HI>Adam</HI>; and is in the <HI>same Sense,</HI> and in all the <HI>same Respects,</HI> the Redeemer and Saviour of all Men alike.&mdash; That Christ has not <HI>thus</HI> redeemed all Mankind, will appear with the strongest Evidence, from the following Considerations.</P>
<P>If Christ be the Saviour of <HI>Believers</HI> in such a Way and in such Respects, as he is <HI>not</HI> the Saviour of <HI>all</HI> Men, then all Men are not equally and alike redeemed by him.&mdash;Now, that he is in such a <HI>special</HI> Manner the Saviour of <HI>Believers,</HI> is confirm'd from 1 Tim. iv.10. <HI>Who is the Saviour of all Men, especially of those that believe.</HI> &mdash; Again,</P>
<P>If there be a <HI>chosen</HI> Number, in a Manner distinct from the rest of the World, <HI>given</HI> to Christ by the Father, to be redeem'd and saved by him, then <HI>all Men</HI> were not equally and alike redeemed by him.&mdash; And that this is so in Fact, we are assured from Christ's own Mouth. Joh. xvii.9, 20. <HI>I pray not for the World: but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine; neither pray I for those alone</HI> (viz. that are now my Disciples) <HI>but for them also, which shall believe in me thro' their Word.</HI>&mdash;Again,</P>
<P>If all those who are given to Christ by the Father to be redeem'd and saved by him, will eventually <HI>believe</HI> in him, and actually ob|tain eternal Life, then <HI>all</HI> Men are not equally redeem'd by him: Since it is undoubted Fact, that <HI>all Men have not Faith,</HI> but many perish in their Unbelief. &mdash; And yet we are assured from Christ's own Mouth, that this is so in Fact. Joh. 6.37. <HI>All that the Fa|ther giveth me, shall come to me: and he that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> So likewise, Joh. xvii.2. <HI>As thou hast given him Power over all Flesh, that he should give eternal Life to as many as thou hast given him.</HI> See also Joh. vi.39. And Joh. x.28, 29.</P>
<P>Moreover,</P>
<P>If Christ <HI>thanks</HI> his heavenly Father, for <HI>hiding</HI> the Benefits of his Redemption from some, and revealing them to others, then it's cer|tain, that he did <HI>not design</HI> his Redemption for every one equally, and alike.&mdash; Surely he did not thank his heavenly Father for defeating the Design of his Redemption, with respect to any Men, and yet he thanks him for <HI>revealing</HI> Salvation to some, and not to others. Matth. xi.25, 26. <HI>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast
<PB N="26" REF="005761_0024_0000000000000000">
hid these Things from the Wise and Prudent; and hast revealed them unto Babes: Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P>Once more,</P>
<P>If no Man whatever will be <HI>eternally saved,</HI> but those only who are <HI>specially redeemed,</HI> in a Manner distinct from the rest of the World, then every individual Person of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Posterity are not equally and alike redeemed by Christ. &mdash; Now, that no Man whatever will be eternally saved, but those only who are redeemed in a Manner distinct from the rest of the World, is evident, in that no <HI>Man can come to Christ, unless it be given unto him of the Fa|ther,</HI> (Joh. vi.65.) and in that it is not given to any of the Fa|ther, to come to Christ and believe in him, but only to those for whom that Gift of Grace is purchased by the Redemption of Christ; as appears from Joh. x.14, 15, 16. <HI>I know my Sheep; and am known of mine; and I lay down my Life for the Sheep. But ye believe not, because ye are not of my Sheep.</HI>&mdash; The same is also further evident from the Consideration following.</P>
<P>If Christ has by his Redemption purchased <HI>Faith,</HI> and the actual Communication of all <HI>sanctifying Grace,</HI> for every one that will ever be eternally saved, then none can be eternally saved, but by Virtue of a <HI>special</HI> Redemption, not common to <HI>all</HI> Men.&mdash;For <HI>all Men</HI> don't obtain saving Faith, and sanctifying Grace.&mdash; And yet Christ has purchased the actual Communication of Faith, and all sanctifying Grace, for every one that will ever be eternally saved. Joh. xvii.16, 17, 19. <HI>They are not of the World, even as I am not of the World. Sanctify them through thy Truth; thy Word is Truth.&mdash;And for their Sakes I sanctify my self, that they also might be sanctified through the Truth.</HI>&mdash; Isa. liii.10. <HI>He shall see his Seed; he shall prolong his Days; and the Pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his Hands.</HI>&mdash;Rom. ix.23. <HI>And that he might make known the Riches of his Glory, on the Vessels of Mercy, which he had afore-prepared unto Glory.</HI> &mdash; Eph. v.25, 26. <HI>Christ also loved the Church; and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it: &mdash; That he might present it unto himself a glorious Church, not having Spot or Wrinkle or any such Thing: but that it should he holy and without Blemish.</HI></P>
<P>Thus then, upon a Review of the Case, it evidently appears, that although Christ is in some Sense <HI>the Saviour of all Men,</HI> so that all who enjoy the Gospel, have the gracious and free Offer of Salvation, yea, all have a full and sufficient Warrant to believe in Christ, and each Individual of them shall surely obtain Salvation, who comply with the free and gracious Offer of the Gospel: Yet Christ has wrought out a <HI>special</HI> and <HI>distinguishing</HI> Redemption for the Elect, whereby they are not only put into a salvable State, but shall be actually saved.&mdash; He has not only purchased for them
<PB N="27" REF="005761_0025_0000000000000000">
a Possibility of Salvation; but the actual Communication of Grace here and Glory hereafter.&mdash; He has not only procured for them, that they <HI>may</HI> be saved, if <HI>they will</HI>; but that they shall assuredly have Salvation begun in them here, and perfected hereafter, be|cause <HI>God will.</HI></P>
<P>This Truth has (I think) been made sufficiently evident, to every unprejudiced Person.&mdash;But if further Evidence be thought needful, it shall be at Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Service (if God spare my Life and Health) when he has given a rational and fair Answer, to what is already offered.</P>
<P>I now proceed further to attend upon Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Reasoning.
<Q>But (says he) if <HI>Redemption</HI> be of no larger Extent than <HI>Salva|tion,</HI> then no Man who perishes in his Wickedness, doth or can <HI>deny Christ who bought him</HI>; he being no more bought or re|deem'd by Christ than the <HI>Devils</HI> themselves.</Q>
(P. 8.)</P>
<P>How unjust is this Representation! From whom did Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> take this View of the Case?&mdash; Is it not constantly acknow|ledged by all the Reformed, that in some Sense Christ died for all; that there is a sufficient Value in the Blood of his Cross, for the Salvation of all Mankind; that Salvation by Christ should be preach'd to <HI>all</HI>; that <HI>all</HI> are Partakers of the Strivings of the Spirit; that there is nothing more needful for the Salvation of <HI>any,</HI> than their believing Entertainment of Christ, and Acceptance of the Benefits already purchased for them; and that <HI>none</HI> will perish at last but through their Neglect of the great Salvation, and for their wilful Continuance in their Sins? &mdash; And now is all this done for the <HI>Devils?</HI>&mdash; What if Christ has done more for some, than others; purchased for and bestowed upon them special efficacious Grace, whereby they are <HI>made willing in the Day of his Power,</HI> and brought to comply with the Gospel Offer? Will this <HI>excuse</HI> the rest of the World in their Rejection of Christ; for which they have no Plea, but their obstinate <HI>Unwillingness</HI> to accept of him, when offered upon Terms the most gracious and conde|scending!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> goes on to argue.&mdash;
<Q>And if this be true, when <HI>wicked</HI> Men are come into the Regions of eternal Despair, they will be <HI>perfectly easy in their Consciences,</HI> and free from all Re|morse and Self-Reproaches, for having despised redeeming Grace. For they must know, that no Pardon, no Aids of the Spirit, no eternal Life, was ever <HI>purchased</HI> or <HI>sincerely offered</HI> to them: So that <HI>Necessity,</HI> not Choice, brought them to <HI>Hell.</HI> And he must be a Fool, or a Mad-Man, that will vex or condemn him|self, for what was never in his Power to avoid.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="005761_0026_0000000000000000">Call it not meer Exclamation, if I say, Did ever Man venture to talk at this Rate! Would not a small Allay of Modesty and Sobriety, on so tremendous a Subject, have much better become a Man of Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Character? &mdash; What! will Sinners be perfectly easy in their Consciences, in the Regions of eternal De|spair, when they come to reflect, that Christ wrought out a <HI>suf|ficient</HI> Redemption for them, <HI>exhibited</HI> himself, and freely <HI>offered</HI> his saving Benefits in the Gospel to 'em; but they wilfully <HI>rejected</HI> both him and them! &mdash; And when they reflect, that God had used all proper <HI>Means</HI> with them for their Salvation; made known their Duty, and the <HI>Way of Salvation</HI> to them; laid all proper <HI>Motives</HI> before them, by the Discovery of their Need of Salvation, by Threatnings and Warnings, by Promises and Invitations, that he might excite both their Hopes and Fears; sent them his <HI>Ambas|sadors,</HI> to beseech them to be reconciled to God; excited them to consider and turn to God, by the common Motions of his <HI>Holy Spirit</HI>; and long exercised <HI>Patience</HI> and Forbearance towards them in the Use of all these Methods and Means of Grace; and after all, they rejected, abused, and sinned away all these Advantages, from no other Necessity, but the Indulgence of their Lusts, and the Perverseness of their Wills; and finally perished, because they <HI>would not come unto Christ, that they might have Life</HI>! &mdash; Is it possible, <HI>Conscience</HI> should be <HI>perfectly Easy</HI> under these Reflections, when awaken'd by Hell-Fire! Surely, Sinners will have another View of Things in the Regions of Despair, than is pretended by Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> in his Discourse. Their Consciences won't then allow them to argue, as this Gentleman now seems to do, that they were <HI>excuseable,</HI> in not improving what Grace and Power they had, because Christ had not purchased greater Benefits for them, or not be|stowed the same upon them, as he had done by some others.&mdash; They'll then feel, that their Perdition was their <HI>wilful Choice</HI>; and therefore most just and righteous.</P>
<P>Would Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> himself accept of such an <HI>Excuse,</HI> as he here puts into the Mouths of impenitent Sinners, from an unfaithful and rebellious <HI>Servant!</HI> Would he be satisfied with such a Plea as this!
<Q>It's true, Sir, I neglected your Business, and wasted your Substance: but it was because my Inclination and Will led me to do so; and I could not will otherwise than I did, while my Affections were so corrupt, and my Will was excited by such a View of Things as I then had: and therefore, I should be a Fool, or a Mad-Man, to condemn my self, for what was not in any Power to avoid. You should have used some effectual Methods to change my Affections; and should have done all in your Power to have efficaciously changed my Will: And then I should not have transgressed.</Q>
&mdash; It is certain, that the Foundation of this Plea is as just in the present Case as the
<PB N="29" REF="005761_0027_0000000000000000">
other; and the Application is accordingly most easy and fa|miliar.</P>
<P>And now Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> must allow me to turn his own Artillery upon himself; and let him try what Way he can avoid the Force of it.&mdash; He tells us, that
<Q><HI>Election</HI> denotes certain peculiar Privileges and Favours, bestowed on some, whereby they are <HI>distinguished</HI> from others. To <HI>elect,</HI> is to chuse one before ano|ther. Now in that God has distinguished <HI>Christians</HI> from all the rest of Mankind, by making us his peculiar People, therefore <HI>all Christians</HI> are the <HI>Elect,</HI> the <HI>Election of Grace,</HI> and <HI>Vessels of Mercy.</HI>&mdash; Which is affirmed of all Christians in general, be|cause they are separated from, and preferred before the rest of Mankind, to enjoy the unsearchable Riches of God's Grace, by Jesus Christ.</Q>
(P. 8, 9.)</P>
<P>Thus then, by Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s own Account of the Matter, the much <HI>greater</HI> Part of the World of Mankind are by an Act of God's Sovereignty left in a State of <HI>Perdition,</HI> without so much as the Means of Grace, or the Knowledge of any Possibility of Sal|vation by Christ; while <HI>a smaller Number, selected from the rest of the World,</HI> are <HI>preferred before them, to be Vessels of Mercy, and en|joy the unsearchable Riches of God's Grace by Iesus Christ.</HI>&mdash;
<Q>And if this be true, then when those poor <HI>Heathen</HI> are come into the Regions of eternal Despair, they will be <HI>perfectly easy</HI> in their Consciences, and free from all Remorse and Self-Reproaches, for having despised <HI>the Riches of God's Goodness.</HI> For they must know, that no Pardon, no Aids of the Spirit, no eternal Life was ever purchased for them, or at all offered to them: so <HI>Necessity,</HI> not Choice, brought them to Hell. And he must be a Fool, or a Mad-Man, who will vex or condemn himself, for what never was in his Power to avoid.</Q></P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> will be pleased to pass his Censure upon his own Argument, as I have turn'd it: And tell us whether he does, or does not esteem it a good one, a Reply will be ready at Hand, however he decides the Case. &mdash; If this Argument be good, as I have now apply'd it, then <HI>his</HI> Reasoning must be good for Nothing. For with what Colour can an Argument be urged against another Man's Sentiment, which militates with as great or greater Force against his own?&mdash; If this Argument be <HI>not</HI> good, as used by me, in the present Case, then it is certainly good for No|thing as urged by <HI>him.</HI> &mdash; For there is an infinite Difference in Point of Privilege, between those <HI>Gospel-Enjoyers,</HI> who are not Par|takers of Christ's special redeeming Mercy and Love; and those poor <HI>Heathen,</HI> who never heard so much as the Name of Christ, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> proved.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="005761_0028_0000000000000000">Upon the whole then, how much better would it have been for Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> to have reflected upon this tremendous Mystery of the divine Sovereignty in some such Manner as the great Apostle did, when discoursing upon the same awful Subject? Rom. xi.33. <HI>O the Depth of the Riches, both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his Iudgments; and his Ways past finding out! For who hath known the Mind of the Lord; or who hath been his Counsellor?</HI></P>
<P>I proceed next to the Consideration of Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Attempt to prove, that
<Q>Enjoying the Privileges of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> is that <HI>Election of Grace,</HI> which so often occurs in the New-Testament.</Q>
&mdash; This he repeatedly asserts, and particularly insists upon; and it must be received for true, as far as his Word will go in the Case. But the Reasons why he thus understands the Doctrine of <HI>Election,</HI> he sees fit to keep to himself; unless the mentioning some Texts of <HI>Scripture,</HI> without any proper Illustration or Evidence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their Pertinency to his Purpose, be esteem'd by him sufficient to prove the Point.&mdash; Whether this be so or not, I shall now consider.</P>
<P>I shall first take Notice of two Texts of Scripture cited by him, from the first Epistle of <HI>Peter.</HI> I mention them both together, be|cause one Answer will serve for 'em both. &mdash; The first is, 1 Pet. ii.9. <HI>Ye are a chosen Generation, a royal Priesthood, a holy Nation, a peculiar People.</HI> The second is, 1 Pet. v.13. <HI>The Church that is at</HI> Babylon, <HI>elect together with you, saluteth you.</HI>&mdash; Of the first of these Texts he tells us,
<Q>It is affirmed of <HI>all Christi|ans</HI> in general, because they are separated from, and preferred before the rest of Mankind, to enjoy the unsearchable Riches of God's Grace by Jesus Christ.</Q>
Of the second he tells us, that
<Q>by their being <HI>elect together,</HI> the Apostle only means, that these two Churches were planted about the same Time.</Q>
&mdash; But why does he understand these Texts in this View? Is there any Thing in the Texts themselves, any Thing in the Nature of Things, which makes this Interpretation so much as probable? Here he is silent.&mdash; This is <HI>his</HI> Sense of the Texts; and we must receive this Comment, upon his Authority. &mdash; But let us look into the Case a little, and judge for ourselves.</P>
<P>Are <HI>all Christians,</HI> in general,
"a royal Priesthood, and an holy Nation?"
Do they all
"shew forth the Praises of God,"
as they ought to do whom He hath
"called out of Darkness into his marvellous Light?"
Is it not evident beyond all Contradiction, that this Text does not, cannot, refer to all professed Christians, in com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">: But to such only, who are not meerly chosen to the En|joyment of Gospel-Privileges, but are also chosen to Sanctification and eternal Salvation? &mdash; Let the Apostle himself determine this
<PB N="31" REF="005761_0029_0000000000000000">
Case, by the Superscription or Direction of this Epistle, in the two first Verses of it. &mdash; Peter, <HI>an Apostle of Iesus Christ, to the</HI> STRANGERS <HI>scattered throughout</HI> Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, <HI>and</HI> Bithynia; <HI>Elect, according to the Foreknowledge of God the Father, through Sanctification of the Spirit, unto Obedience, and sprink|ling of the Blood of Iesus Christ.</HI>&mdash; Here then, we see who the "Elect" are, to whom this Epistle was directed, who we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<Q>the chosen Generation, the royal Priesthood,</Q>
in the first cited Text: and how empty Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Pretence is, that this implies "all Christians in general."&mdash; Have all professing Christians, in ge|neral,
"the Sanctification of the Spirit, unto Obedience?"
Are they all
"sprinkled with the Blood of Christ?"
Have they all this Evidence of their being
"<HI>Elect,</HI> according to the Fore-knowledge of God the Father?"
Alas, the Case is far otherwise!&mdash; Here we likewise see, what the Apostle means by the Word <HI>Elect</HI> in the second cited Text. He means such as were
"chosen according to the Foreknowledge of God the Father,"
to Holiness here and eternal Happiness hereafter; for to these was the Epistle expresly directed: and not, as Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> pretends, that <HI>these two Churches were planted about the same Time.</HI> For Nothing can be more tri|fling and ludicrous, than this Pretence.&mdash; Which, I beseech him, were the "two Churches that were planted about the same Time? &mdash; The one must be the Church that was at <HI>Babylon,</HI> the other the Church of all the converted
"STRANGERS, scatter'd throughout <HI>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.</HI>"
This latter must be a vastly extended Church indeed; which must have required a very active and indefatigable <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> duely to inspect it! GALATIA, which was comparatively but a very small Part of this pretended Church, contain'd more than one Church, in the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI>'s Account of it. <HI>Gal.</HI> i.2. <HI>Unto the</HI> CHURCHES <HI>of Galatia.</HI> &mdash;But were it admitted, that this prodigious Extent of Territory was all consider'd as one Church; Does this Gentleman suppose, that all the Strangers throughout so large a Tract of the World, were converted "about the same Time?" Don't we all know, from the sacred Story, that it took the Apostles a very large Space of Time, to propagate the Gospel thro' those very distant Regions of the World?&mdash; Thus we see what becomes of Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s first and chief Foundation for his new and chimerical Doc|trine of <HI>Election.</HI></P>
<P>The second Text produced by Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> in favour of this Notion, is, Eph. i.4. <HI>According as he hath chosen us in him, be|fore the Foundation of the World, that we should be holy and with|out Blame before him in Love; having predestinated us to the Adop|tion of Children.</HI> &mdash; But how does he prove from this Text, that enjoying the Privileges of the Gospel is that
"<HI>Election</HI> of Grace, that so often occurs in the New Testament?"
&mdash; He assures us that
"in this eternal Election, St. <HI>Paul</HI> comprehends all Christian
<PB N="32" REF="005761_0030_0000000000000000">
People."
And this is all the Reason he pretends to assign, for the Pertinency of this Text to his Purpose.</P>
<P>I can't imagine what should prompt him to cite this Text, un|less it were merely to impose upon an injudicious Reader, with a Shew of Scripture-Authority. What can be more directly repug|nant to his Scheme, than this Passage of Scripture?&mdash; Was not this Epistle directed to the SAINTS, which were at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> ver. 1? Are they not represented <HI>as accepted in the Beloved,</HI> ver. 6? Are they not, in the cited Text, said to be <HI>chosen, that they should be holy and without Blame before God in Love</HI>; and <HI>predestinated to the Adoption of Children?</HI>&mdash; But are all professing Christians SAINTS? Are they all <HI>accepted</HI> in the Beloved? Are they all <HI>holy</HI> and with|out Blame? Are they all God's adopted <HI>Children?</HI>&mdash; Could Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> imagine, that citing a Scripture, so directly repugnant to what he would maintain, will ever prevail upon Men of Reason and Conscience, to reject the Doctrines of the Reformation, for such a new and trifling Notion as this?</P>
<P>The last Text cited by him, is 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> i.10. <HI>Wherefore the ra|ther, Brethren, give Diligence to make your Calling and Election sure.</HI> &mdash;Upon it I must observe, That all which has been said with Rela|tion to the two first cited Texts, are applicable to this also; this being in the same Epistle, and spoken to the same Persons, as those other Texts were: and this therefore might have been consider'd conjunctly with them, were it not for an Argument Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> pretends to draw from this, which he may suppose deserves Conside|ration&mdash; He thus argues:
<Q>This cannot be meant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an absolute personal Election; for, if there be such a Thing, it is not in our Power to make it surer and firmer than God has made it.</Q>
P. 14.&mdash; But is it not possible to make this sure to <HI>our selves</HI>? Is it not possible by making our <HI>Calling</HI> sure, to make it also sure, that we are the Objects of God's <HI>electing</HI> Love? Is it not possible to know the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ause by the Effect, the Fountain by the Streams; or the Antecedent by the Consequent? And does not the Apostle assure us, that this is pos|sible by such Means to be known? 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> i.4, 5. <HI>Knowing, Bre|thren beloved, your Election of God. For our Gospel came not unto you in Word only; but also in Power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much Assurance.</HI>&mdash; But now let us turn the Tables, and see how pertinent the Text is to the Purpose for which it is cited, and to Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Doctrine of Election. In that View, it must be thus paraphrased,
"Let Christians give Diligence to make it sure, that they profess Christianity."
&mdash; This is the necessary Construction of the Words, if consider'd as speaking in Favour of his Scheme; and there needs no further Remarks upon it. It would be an idle and ludicrous Attempt, to undertake to prove, that there does not need much Diligence, to be assured, that we make a christian Profession?</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="005761_0031_0000000000000000">There is one Text of Scripture quoted by Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> which I have not yet taken Notice of; because I did not know whether he cited it as a direct Proof of his Doctrine of Election, or not; though he tells us, that Election and the quoted Text are both to be understood of our being called to the Knowledge of Christianity. However, that he mayn't complain of Neglect, I shall take some very brief Notice of it.&mdash;The Text I refer to, is this, Eph. ii.8. <HI>By Grace are ye saved through Faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the Gift of God: not of Works, lest any Man should boast.</HI>
<Q>This <HI>Salvation</HI> (says he) which these Christians had already ob|tain'd, was not <HI>eternal</HI> Salvation: but a Deliverance from that wretched Condition they were in, and the horrid Guilt they had contracted, while <HI>Heathens.</HI></Q>
&mdash; But I demand, Were they de|livered from their former Guilt; and therefore justified before God: And yet not Partakers of <HI>eternal Salvation?</HI> The Apostle teaches us another Doctrine, Rom. viii.30. <HI>Whom he justified, them he also glorified.</HI>&mdash; I have observ'd already, that these <HI>Ephesians</HI> were consider'd as SAINTS, and addressed as such, Chap. i. ver. 1. &mdash; Now God <HI>hath given to</HI> such <HI>eternal Life.</HI> 1 Joh. v.11. He not only <HI>will</HI> glorify them: but he <HI>hath</HI> already glorified them. Glory is already begun in their Souls; and will be carried on <HI>from Glory to Glory.</HI> 2 Cor. iii.18. He not only will give them eternal Life: but hath already given it. They are at present ac|tual Partakers of that Salvation, which shall never end. Joh. iii.36. <HI>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting Life.&mdash;And shall not come into Condemnation; but is passed from Death unto Life.</HI> Joh. v.24.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> further observes,
<Q>This Text does not mean, that their Faith is so God's Gift, as not to be of themselves, as is most evident to any who reads the Original.</Q>
<HI>Ibid</HI> &mdash; This is certainly a great Mistake. For many learned Commentators and Criticks, more capable Judges of the Original than he or I can pretend to be, have read the Original, and have found the quite contrary to what Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> asserts, to be most evident.&mdash; What, I suppose, he means is, that the Relative THAT, being of the neuter Gender, and the Word FAITH of the feminine, they can't agree together. But if he would only translate the Greek Rela|tive <HI>That Thing,</HI> viz. the Thing last spoken of, so all Difficulty at once vanishes. (<HI>Vid.</HI> Beza <HI>in Loc.</HI>)&mdash; But what will Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> gain by this Criticism? &mdash; It must be either <HI>Faith,</HI> or <HI>Grace,</HI> or else the whole Matter of the Sentence foregoing, which the <HI>Apo|stle</HI> asserts to be <HI>not of our selves.</HI>&mdash; There is the same Objection against the Greek Relative's agreeing with <HI>Grace,</HI> as with <HI>Faith.</HI> The Apostle must therefore, according to this Criticism, refer to the whole Sentence aforegoing; and mean, that our Salvation, by Grace, through Faith, is not of our selves.&mdash; Well then! <HI>Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="005761_0032_0000000000000000">
is not of our selves; <HI>Salvation</HI> is not of our selves; and <HI>Faith</HI> is not of <HI>our selves</HI>: but they are all the <HI>Gift</HI> of GOD. And if Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> chuses this Comment, I'll not contend with him.&mdash; He un|derstands it (he tells us) to signify that their being saved or deli|ver'd by the <HI>Gospel,</HI> was not of themselves. But he should remem|ber, that the Apostle here speaks of no other but being saved by Grace through <HI>Faith</HI>: And therefore he here agrees with the same Doctrine, which he elsewhere teaches, that <HI>Faith</HI> is not of our selves; but that <HI>Christ Iesus is both the Author and Finisher of our Faith.</HI> (Heb. xii.2.) And that <HI>God fulfills the Work of Faith with Power.</HI> 2 Thess. i.11.</P>
<P>But what Evidence have we all this while, that this Text refers to Nothing but our Enjoyment of the Gospel?&mdash; No more than this, it is Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Opinion: but why it is so, he either does not know, or does not see Cause to tell.</P>
<P>To conclude this Discourse upon <HI>Election.</HI>&mdash; The infinite Perfec|tions of the divine Nature make the Doctrine of personal Election most certain and evident: that there is no Room for any one, who has a just Apprehension of the glorious Attributes of God, to call it into Question, as Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> repeatedly does.&mdash;The divine Om|niscience must certainly have all Futurities in View at once. &mdash; Impossible it is, that God should foreknow all Events with Respect to rational Agents, if they were not certainly future, or <HI>to be</HI>:&mdash; And equally impossible that they could be future, or foreknown by God as Futurities, if not according to the Counsel of his Will. &mdash; Hence it necessarily follows, that the eternal State of each single Person, with all the Means conducing to it, is what <HI>God's Counsel had determined before.</HI>&mdash; I am the more convinced of the Justice of this Reasoning, because the Apostle has used it long before me. Rom. viii.29. <HI>For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son.</HI>&mdash; When Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> pleases to make a Reply, and to shew the Reason why he doubts, whe|ther there be such a Thing as a personal Election, I desire he would give a particular Answer to this Argument.</P>
<P>The Order of Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Discouse calls upon me next to con|sider, whether God has given to every Man Grace sufficient for Salvation: But he having in the Prosecution of his Discourse upon that Subject, made some very indecent Reflections upon the Doctrine of ORIGINAL SIN, it seems proper in the first Place, to consider and remove these out of the Way.</P>
<P><Q>Could we (says he) have had our Choice, when <HI>Adam</HI> was created, I am perswaded, that no Man who had a just Regard to his own Interest, would willingly have reposed such a vast Trust in the Hands of <HI>Adam,</HI> nor indeed of the best <HI>Angel</HI> in
<PB N="35" REF="005761_0033_0000000000000000">
Heaven, as to be obliged to be eternally happy or miserable, accord|ing to the Choice he should make.</Q>
(Page 19.) And again,
<Q>As to the Bulk of Mankind, he having given them such a <HI>Diabo|lical</HI> Nature, that they can no more cease to sin, than to breathe. &mdash;But are left in as helpless and hopeless a Condition as the <HI>Devils,</HI> who fell by their own personal Act; while these were undone by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, to which they never consented: Yet for this Sin, or the necessary and unavoidable Effects of it, they must be tormented to all Eternity.</Q>
&mdash; I am sure, I have no Need to make any Remarks upon the bold and daring (not to say the profane) Air of this Language and Manner of Address! It lies much too open to the Reflection of every Reader, who has any just Impressions of the tremendous Majesty of Heaven and Earth. &mdash; I shall therefore confine my Remarks, to what is principally design'd to be insinuated in this Part of his Discourse; which seems to be, that it would not be <HI>just</HI> in God, to impute <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin to his Descendants, because it was not equal, nor what we, if then ex|isting, should have consented to, that he should be our foederal Re|presentative, and we appointed to stand or fall with him: And therefore, that we cannot be under such an Imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin.&mdash; This must have been his Meaning, if his Words are con|sider'd as signifying any Thing at all to his Purpose. This there|fore, I shall briefly consider.</P>
<P>And I remark first, that to me there is nothing more evident, than that <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin is imputed to us; and consequently that God is most <HI>equal</HI> and <HI>just</HI> in the Imputation. For the Judge of all the Earth always does, and always will do <HI>Right.</HI>&mdash; It is much more becoming such poor Worms as we, to enquire whether God has done this, than whether it is equal that he should do it.&mdash; For if the former be evident, the latter should be concluded without any Hesitancy or Dispute. &mdash; This should swallow up all our Doubts and Enquiries of that Kind. The infinite Fountain of Jus|tice and Equity most certainly does, and cannot but do, what is equal and right; whether we can see into the Equity of his Dispensations, or not.&mdash; And I think, we have no less Certainty from our continued Experience, that we are <HI>fallen</HI> Creatures, than we have of our own Existence. &mdash; No Man can look into him|self, and not find the dreadful Defection of his whole Nature; his Understanding naturally dark, his Affections irregular, his Appetites and Passions exorbitant, his Will perverse; and his Soul running out more after the Creature, than the Creator; and dreadfully dis|tant from a Conformity to, and Delight in the glorious Perfections of God.&mdash; No Man can look about him, but he must behold the World of Mankind in a degenerate State. He must see, that Wickedness covers the Face of the Earth; that the natural Dispo|si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of Mankind in common, from Generation to Generation, is evil, only evil, and that continually.&mdash;And whence did this slow?
<PB N="36" REF="005761_0034_0000000000000000">
It is certain from the divine Perfections, that we could not come thus polluted out of the Hands of God at our first Creation: But that human Nature must have degenerated, and lost its primi|tive Rectitude. Nor could the blessed God be the Author or Spring of this: And therefore, that there must be some other Source of this Apostacy.&mdash; Why then can't we rest satisfied, with|out disputing, in the Representation God himself has given us of this Matter in his Word? It is amazing, that any Man who has the least Reverence for the Word of God, should call in Question a Fact, which is so strongly and repeatedly asserted, as well as par|ticularly explain'd, in many Places of the sacred Scriptures, both of the Old and New Testament; though more fully in the latter, and perhaps most fully in the Epistle to the <HI>Romans.</HI>&mdash; Are we not there taught (in Chapter 5<HI>th</HI>) That <HI>by one Man Sin entered into the World; and Death by Sin; and so Death passed upon all Men; for that all have sinned</HI>; That <HI>through the Offence of one, many be dead</HI>; That <HI>the Iudgment was by one, to Condemnation</HI>: And that <HI>by one Man's Disobedience, many were made Sinners,</HI> &amp;c?&mdash; Is it possible, that any Thing can be represented in more intelligible, expressive, and convincing Words, than the Imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin is here represented and confirmed?&mdash; And what greater Confirmation can we have of any Truth, than our own Experience and the Word of God?&mdash; What then stands in the Way of this Doctrine? We mayn't perhaps see into the Equity of the divine Conduct, in this Matter. What then? Can't we be throughly satisfied, that all God's Ways are just and right, whether we can account for some of them, or not? Can't we adore his Footsteps, when we are forc'd to cry out, <HI>O the Depths of the Riches, both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God!</HI></P>
<P>But then, in the present Case, there appears Matter enough of Satisfaction to every humble Soul, who will look into it wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h an unprejudiced Eye.&mdash; Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> indeed tells us,
<Q>he is perswaded, that no Man who had a just Regard to his own Interest, would willingly have reposed such a vast Trust in the Hands of <HI>Adam.</HI></Q>
&mdash; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> on the contrary, I am perswaded that every Man (if then actually existing) who had known his own Interest, would willingly have reposed this Trust in the Hands of <HI>Adam</HI>; and would have esteemed it much safer there, than in his own Hands.</P>
<P>Was it not an incomparably easier Thing, for <HI>Adam</HI> to have refrain'd from the <HI>forbidden Fruit,</HI> than for every one, or for any one of his Posterity, for ever to have kept the Law of Nature, in all its Demands?&mdash; Was not <HI>Adam</HI> much more concern'd, than any of his Posterity could have been, not to incur the Penalty of a broken Law; in that he had not only his own Interest, but the In|terest of all his Posterity at Stake?&mdash; Was not <HI>Adam</HI> much more likely to stand, than any of his Posterity could have been; having

at least as great natural Powers, and so much higher Motives, as his being God's immediate Workmanship, his personally receiving the Law from the Mouth of God, and his representing so many Mil|lions of Souls besides himself, to give him the most lively Impres|sions of his Duty and Interest, and the strongest Inducements to Vigilance and Care lest he should fall?&mdash; Was there not the greatest Probability in the World, that <HI>Adam</HI> would by the Influ|ence of such powerful Motives, have kept the easy Condition of Life; and have thereby established himself and all his Posterity in a perpetual State of Life and Happiness?&mdash; And on the other Hand, was there any Thing a like Probability, that every one of his Posterity would perpetually have kept the Law of Nature; when the Demands of it would have been (at least in their Du|ration) incomparably greater, their Strength no greater than his, and they liable to Temptation as great, every Hour of their Lives, as his was at the fatal Trial? And was it not a Thing infinitely desirable, to be brought into a State of Stability, and freed of all uneasy Apprehensions of Danger from a prevalent Temptation?&mdash; And I may add to all this; Would it not have been voted, by all the World, a Dispensation of infinite Goodness, if <HI>Adam</HI> had stood; and we had all through him been established in a State of Life and Peace for ever? &mdash; When all these Things are consi|der'd, let any Man judge, whether he would not have concurred to the Covenant made with <HI>Adam,</HI> if he had then personally exist|ed, and it had been left to his own Choice; and whether this was not a good and equal Dispensation, in that God, who takes his Measures from the Perfections of his own Nature, and not from the future Conduct of his Creatures?&mdash; But of these Things I have spoken more largely in another Discourse, to which the Reader is refer'd, if he desires fuller Satisfaction.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Scripture-Doctrine</HI> &amp;c. Disc. II.</NOTE></P>
<P>I am now to consider, whether God has universally and indif|ferently given to all Men <HI>Grace sufficient</HI> for Salvation: Or whe|ther we can obtain eternal Life, by Vertue of our Improvement of that <HI>common Grace,</HI> which is given to all Men.&mdash; This Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> strongly and confidently asserts, and endeavours to prove.</P>
<P><Q>If that common Grace (says he) which God affords to all Christians, did not render their Salvation possible, we had e'en as good be without, as receive it.</Q>
(Page 17.)&mdash; That he means by their Salvation being possible, that it is attainable by their Im|provement of that common Grace, is certain from his further Ex|plications of his Meaning. He accordingly tells us,
<Q>Tho' Man is a fallen Creature, yet there is in every one a Power of self-determining, of chusing and refusing, by which a Man can com|ply with, or reject the Suggestions of the Holy Spirit.</Q>
(P. 21.)
<PB N="38" REF="005761_0036_0000000000000000">
&mdash;And again,
<Q>If we suppose two Men of the same natural Abili|ties, and under the same Advantages and Operations of the Holy Ghost, the one may so improve his Power of Consideration, as to become a wise and happy Man, and an eternal Companion of the blessed Angel; while the other by neglecting his Reason, and abandoning himself to be govern'd by his fleshly Appetites, may make himself so vile a Monster, as to be fit for nothing but the Portion of Devils.</Q>
(Page 28.)&mdash;With much more to the same Purpose.&mdash; His Arguments to confirm this Doctrine, are now to be considered.</P>
<P>He argues from Ezek. xxiv.13. <HI>Because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, therefore thou shalt not be purged any more.</HI>&mdash;
<Q>Which, without all Peradventure (says he) denotes, that God had done his Part: but it failed through their neglecting to do their Part.</Q>
(Page 17.)&mdash;Very well! GOD had done <HI>his Part,</HI> that is (according to Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s own Interpretation) he had given them <HI>common Grace,</HI> whereby they might reform their Lives, and perform the external Duties of Religion: But they provoked God by <HI>not improving</HI> these Advantages and Powers, that were given them.&mdash; Now what follows? How does it appear, that <HI>improving</HI> com|mon Grace would have intitled them to, or qualified them for <HI>eternal Salvation?</HI> Does the Text say any Thing of this Kind; or can any Thing of this Kind be any Way deduced from it?&mdash;No! but this is the whole Force of the Argument. Common Grace must be sufficient to <HI>all</HI> Men for eternal Salvation; because God gave common Grace to <HI>some</HI> Men, and was provoked with them for not improving it. Or in other Words, God gives <HI>Power</HI> to Men to <HI>improve</HI> common Grace, therefore the <HI>Improvement</HI> of com|mon Grace is <HI>sufficient</HI> to eternal Salvation.&mdash; <HI>That is,</HI> the Improve|ment of common Grace is sufficient to Salvation, because it is so.&mdash; Let Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> try his Skill; and make more of this Argument, if he can.</P>
<P>He proceeds.&mdash;
<Q>So Hos. xiii.9. <HI>O Israel, thou hast destroyed thy self.</HI> But how can a Sinner's Destruction be <HI>of himself,</HI> if he can't help it, and God never put it in his Power to be any Thing else, but a wicked and miserable Creature?</Q></P>
<P>To this I answer, that the Argument concludes the quite contrary Way. For, if it be as here supposed, that Sinners have Power to be nothing but <HI>wicked</HI> Creatures, it is certain that they will destroy themselves; and can't do otherwise. For <HI>Wickedness overthroweth the Sinner,</HI> Prov. xiii.6. &mdash; But perhaps by the Expression, <HI>how can a Sinner's Destruction be of himself?</HI> Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> may mean, how can a Sinner be the <HI>faulty</HI> Cause of his own Destruction, if God has not given him Power to be any Thing else, but a wicked Creature?&mdash; But to this I also answer, as before. If this be sup|posed,
<PB N="39" REF="005761_0037_0000000000000000">
he must necessarily be the faulty Cause of his own De|struction, upon that very Account: For <HI>Wickedness</HI> is always faul|ty; and always, by its natural and moral Efficacy, the Cause of De|struction: And therefore he that necessarily continues a wicked Creature, must necessarily, by that very Means, be the faulty Cause of his own Destruction.&mdash; What therefore could Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> mean by this Argument, unless it be to deduce this horrible and amaz|ing Consequence; That if God don't give the Sinner <HI>Grace suffi|cient</HI> for Salvation, he can't help his working Wickedness: and therefore God, and not he, must be the blameable Cause of it: And his Destruction must be of God, and not of himself!&mdash; I can see no Colour of Argument in it, unless it be taken in this View. And if this be his Meaning, I must needs say, it is high Time he should learn more awful Reverence for the glorious GOD, than to dare either to speak, or think, after this Manner. And that this is indeed his Meaning, appears evident, by his sarcastick Flouts, else|where in this Discourse, particularly in <HI>P.</HI> 25, where he has these scandalous Expressions;
<Q>As to the Bulk of Mankind, he having given them such a wicked and <HI>diabolical Nature,</HI> that they can no more cease to sin, than to breathe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
See likewise, <HI>Pages</HI> 19, 23 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 26.&mdash; There is therefore too just Occasion to apply the Apostle's Rebuke to him: <HI>Nay, but O Man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the Thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter Power over the Clay, to make one Vessel unto Honour; and another unto Dishonour?</HI> Rom. ix.20.</P>
<P>Here then I might fairly dismiss this pretended Argument. But this being the main Plea, which runs through his whole Discourse, it may be proper to make some more particular Reflections upon it, once for all. And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. What does Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> mean by God's <HI>not</HI> having put it in the Sinner's <HI>Power,</HI> to be any Thing else, but a wicked and mise|rable Creature?&mdash; Don't the <HI>Calvinist</HI> Divines unitedly agree, that God has given <HI>common Grace,</HI> even to those, unto whom he has not given his special and saving Influences? Is it not universally al|low'd, that by Virtue of this common Grace, they have a Power to refrain from open Scandal, to perform the external Duties of Religion, to take Pains with their Hearts to get them into a pro|per Frame for Duty, and thereby to excite in themselves some Se|riousness, Earnestness and Diligence, to consider of their own Im|potence and Unworthiness, and continue to lie at the Foot|stool of divine Grace for all Supplies of Grace and Strength, for the Sake of Christ, the Mediator and Redeemer?&mdash; Is it not uni|versally allow'd, that if this be their Temper and Conduct, they have sufficient Encouragement given them in the Gospel, to hope, that they may obtain the special and saving Influences of the bless|ed
<PB N="40" REF="005761_0038_0000000000000000">
Spirit? Are they not told often, that in this Way Thousands have sought and succeeded; and that every individual Sinner has in this Way as much Reason to hope, as any unconverted Sinner in the World ever had?&mdash; And is not this enough to animate a poor condemned Malefactor to apply to his offended Sovereign for Grace and Mercy? Shall such a poor guilty Worm stand upon Terms, with an infinite and sovereign God; and refuse to comply with the Methods and Means of Grace, which he is able to comply with, unless God will first give him further Strength and Helps?&mdash; Shall he venture to go on in his Sins, under the most powerful In|centives to the contrary: And yet plead, that because God has not given him special Grace, his <HI>Destruction</HI> is not from <HI>himself,</HI> but from God; though the Sinner voluntarily indulges his Lusts, neglects the Means of Grace, and rejects the free Offers of Mercy?&mdash; If these be the Terms, that poor foolish Sinners will insist upon, they must finally know, by a terrible Conviction, when it is too late, that they have not only brought Destruction, but an aggravated Destruc|tion, upon themselves.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let it also be consider'd, where the <HI>Seat</HI> of this Impotency is, namely, in the <HI>Will:</HI> That the true Reason why Sinners <HI>can't</HI> com|ply with the Terms of the Gospel, is because they <HI>won't.</HI>&mdash; Their Hearts and Affections are wedded to their Lusts and Idols; and they have such a self-righteous Disposition, as to be too proud to stoop to the self-abasing, tho' most gracious Terms of the Gospel: and for this Cause, and this only, they continue in their Sins, and perish.&mdash; <HI>Whosoever will,</HI> are invited to come to Christ, and to par|take of the Waters of Life <HI>freely.</HI> Let their Sins be ever so many, and ever so great, they may obtain Justification, Sanctification, and eternal Salvation, if they are but truly <HI>willing</HI> to accept of a precious Saviour, as exhibited in the Gospel. And they have no other Ex|cuse for continuing in Sin, but that they would not comply with the Gospel-Call, embrace the Gospel-Promise, and trust in the only Redeemer.&mdash; From whence then is their Destruction, but from them|selves; and from their own voluntary Choice?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> must allow this Argument to be conclusive, because it is <HI>his own;</HI> and may be found in this Sermon of his, now under Consideration. He himself tells us,
<Q>That all we do towards our Salvation, is to <HI>accept</HI> of the <HI>Grace</HI> of God, when offered. And if we do accept it, we shall be saved: but if we do not, we shall perish.</Q>
(Page 25.) And yet he tells us,
<Q>That <HI>no Man will</HI> ever come to Christ and accept of this kind Offer, unless the <HI>Fa|ther draw him,</HI> and it be <HI>given</HI> him from above.</Q>
(P. 15.) &mdash; And does it not then follow, that though no Man will comply with the Terms of Salvation, unless excited by the special Influences of divine Grace, they yet fail of Salvation, only by their wilful Re|jection of the most condescending and gracious Proposal, which can
<PB N="41" REF="005761_0039_0000000000000000">
be made to rational Creatures; and therefore that their De|struction is wholly of themselves?</P>
<P>He goes on to argue;
<Q>When GOD (<HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxiii.11.) swears, that he has <HI>no Pleasure</HI> in the Death of the Wicked, but <HI>chuses</HI> that he should <HI>turn</HI> and <HI>live;</HI> how can this be true, that he don't chuse that Men should remain wicked and perish, if he withholds from them that <HI>Grace,</HI> without which they can no more turn, than a dead Corpse can raise itself to Life.</Q></P>
<P>To which I answer, that the Printer of Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Bible must have been very faulty; or Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> himself very careless in reading the quoted Text. For I find Nothing there, of God's <HI>chusing</HI> that a Sinner should turn and live. God does indeed there declare, that <HI>he hath no Pleasure in the Death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his Way&punc; and live.</HI> Yet all that can be justly infer'd from this Text, is, that the Repentance and Conversion of Sinners is a Thing acceptable to the God of all Grace, and <HI>according to the good Pleasure of his Goodness</HI>; but not that he efficaciously <HI>chuses,</HI> purposes, and consequently endeavours the Conversion indifferently of Sinners in general. The former flows from the Goodness of his Nature: The latter would argue his Want of Power, with Respect to those who fail of Salvation.</P>
<P>This being premised, I proceed to consider the Force of Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Arguings from the Text.</P>
<P>As for his first Argument, from <HI>God's giving Men such a Nature&punc; that they can't help but be wicked</HI>; I have newly consider'd it, and shall therefore now pass it over as impertinent.</P>
<P>His second Argument is,
<Q>He doth not truly <HI>will</HI> an <HI>Event,</HI> who doth not will the <HI>necessary Means.</HI> And if God is not willing to give all Men <HI>sufficient Grace,</HI> I can't conceive how he can be truly said to be willing and desirous, that they should <HI>turn</HI> and <HI>live.</HI></Q>
&mdash; By "necessary Means," he must intend, if he speaks to the Purpose, <HI>Grace sufficient</HI> for the <HI>Conversion</HI> of Sinners unto God. And what are these necessary Means, or this Grace sufficient? What but <HI>Christ's making them willing in the Day of his Power?</HI> Psal. cx.3. What but the Exercise <HI>of the exceeding Greatness of God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ower; and the working of his mighty Power?</HI> Eph. i.19. What but <HI>God's working in them both to will and to do, of his good Pleasure?</HI> Phil. i.13. What but <HI>God's giving a new Heart, and a new Spirit; taking away the Heart of St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e out of their Flesh, and giving them a Heart of Flesh?</HI> Ezek. xxxvi.26.&mdash; These, and these only, are Means sufficient for the Conversion of Sinners to God; as appears from Multitudes of Passages in the Word of God, besides these now recited. &mdash; The Question therefore is, whether God does in Fact
<PB N="42" REF="005761_0040_0000000000000000">
"will these necessary Means," in Order to the Conversion of all Sinners, without Distinction?&mdash; If so, whence is it, that all Sinners in common, don't <HI>turn</HI> and <HI>live?</HI>&mdash; Surely it must be within the Compass of the exceeding Greatness of God's <HI>Power,</HI> to give a new Heart, and a new Spirit to all Men, without Exception. For he can do <HI>all his Will.</HI>&mdash; But if God does not will these necessary Means for the Conversion of all Sinners indifferently, what becomes of Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Argument?&mdash; He "can't conceive" how God can truly ex|postulate with Sinners as he does in <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxiii.11. And what then? Is there nothing true with Respect to the glorious God, but what Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> has an adequate Conception of?&mdash; But why can't he conceive the Goodness of God's Nature to be such, that he does not take Pleasure in the Death of a Sinner, as his Creature's Mi|sery: but yet, at the same Time, conceive his Justice and Holiness to be such, that he mayn't see fit to exert his Almighty Power to prevent it?&mdash; Why can't Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> conceive, that Repentance or Conversion in every Instance would be acceptable to God, or agree|able to the <HI>good Pleasure of his Goodness,</HI> when yet he does not see fit to engage all his Power in the Accomplishment of it in the Case of every Sinner, without Difference?&mdash; And why can't he conceive, that though God be infinite Goodness and Mercy, yet that he is also absolute Master and arbitrary Donor of his own special Favours, which he owes to none, and has therefore a Right to bestow where and when he pleases, to <HI>have Mercy upon whom he will have Mercy?</HI> &mdash; Whether he can conceive of these Things or not, we have no greater Certainty of any Truths whatsoever, than that these are all true. <HI>And he that reproveth</HI> GOD, <HI>let him answer it.</HI></P>
<P>We are next told,
<Q>When GOD <HI>works in us,</HI> he does not work <HI>irr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sistably.</HI> For in that Case, we could not forbear to <HI>work out our Salvation.</HI> But the Holy Ghost works so in us, that we may <HI>chuse</HI> whether we will work <HI>with</HI> him, or <HI>against</HI> him. We can at the same Time, either <HI>quench,</HI> or cherish <HI>the Spirit.</HI> &mdash; We can either <HI>resist,</HI> or comply with the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI></Q>
(P. 20.)</P>
<P>There is a Vein of such extraordinary Discourse running through his whole Sermon.&mdash; But what Evidence have we to sustain it? No|thing more than his confident Assertion. All therefore that appears needful, is to look on the other Side of the Question; and to see if the contrary to this has no better Support.</P>
<P>The Scriptures represent to us, that the Conversion of Sinners is wrought by the special Illumination and Influence of the Spirit of God; whereby they have an effectual Discovery, not only of their own Sin and Misery, but of the glorious Nature and Way and Au|thor of the Salvation revealed in the Gospel. And when they thus, <HI>with open Face, behold as in a Glass, the Glory of the Lord,</HI> it power|fully <HI>changes them into the same Image, from Glory to Glory.</HI> 2 Cor.
<PB N="43" REF="005761_0041_0000000000000000">
iii.18. They can't but be pleased with &amp; concur to the Gospel-Offer of Salvation, when the Spirit of God enables them to behold it in its Divine Grace and Excellency. They know themselves to be con|demned Malefactors, and can't but be willing to accept a Pardon, when they have a sensible View that there is one freely offered. They feel themselves sinking &amp; drowning in Perdition, and can't but be willing to be pulled out of the horrible Pit, when they have a sensible View of sufficient Help at Hand. They are irresistibly <HI>drawn</HI> to Christ, and compelled to turn and live.&mdash; But Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> tells us, that if this were the Case,
<Q>we could not forbear to work out our own Salvation.</Q>
I answer, that though there be no <HI>Force</HI> in the Case, yet when the Mind is thus illuminated and re|newed by the Holy Spirit, he invincibly perswades and influences the Will, so that the Sinner is necessarily, though freely and willingly, <HI>drawn</HI> to Christ, is sweetly <HI>constrain'd by the Love of Christ,</HI> and under this blessed Influence, he <HI>cannot,</HI> he <HI>will not,</HI> forbear to <HI>work out his own Salvation.</HI>&mdash; When I am told, that two and three make five, the Proposition commands my Assent, without offering any Violence to my Understanding. And so in the present Case, there is no Force upon the Sinner, when by a divine Light, and Life-giving Influence, he is brought to see and feel his Misery and Remedy; and thereby necessarily, but freely acquiesces in that Way of Salvation, so glori|ously accommodated to all his Wants and Desires.&mdash; That this is the Case in Fact, is abundantly confirm'd, not only by the Experience of the Children of God, who have found themselves thus compelled, and yet <HI>willing, in the Day of Christ's Power:</HI> but also from the Oracles of God, where this Method of the divine Operation is par|ticularly described. 2 Cor. iv.6. <HI>For God who commanded the Light to shine out of Darkness, hath shined into our Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Iesus Christ.</HI> So likewise <HI>Eph.</HI> i.18. and many other Places.&mdash; That Sinners should thus have their Understanding enlightned, their Mind renewed, and thereby be brought into a willing Compliance with the Gospel-Offer, is absolutely necessary to their saving Conversion, be|cause they are under <HI>the Power of Darkness,</HI> Col. i.13. They are <HI>dead in Trespasses and Sins,</HI> Eph. ii.1. And they <HI>receive not the Things of the Spirit of God; neither can they know them,</HI> until they are en|abled <HI>spiritually to discern them.</HI> 2 Cor. ii.14.&mdash; And I venture to shew my Opinion, that he who has not experienced this transform|ing Light and Power of the Holy Ghost, illuminating his Mind, al|luring his Heart, and attracting his Will, so as to necessitate his free Compliance with the Gospel-Offer, such an one has Reason to fear, that he is yet in his Sins, a Stranger to Christ, and an Enemy to God. &mdash; Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> indeed insinuates, that this Doctrine takes away a Man's Freedom, renders him <HI>a mere Engine,</HI> and leaves him but <HI>an intelligent Machine.</HI> (Page 21, 22.)&mdash;But how, I beseech him, does a Man's acting from the clearest Light and purest Reason, from the
<PB N="44" REF="005761_0042_0000000000000000">
most rational Convictions, and the noblest Motives impressed by the Spirit of God, render him an <HI>Engine,</HI> or a <HI>Machine?</HI></P>
<P>Another Argument Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> offers, to confirm his Doctrine, is this;&mdash;
<Q>Without supposing, that <HI>sufficient Grace</HI> is afforded to <HI>all,</HI> I cannot possibly understand the Sense of that Expostulation, Isai. v.3, 4. <HI>And now, O Inhabitants of</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my Vineyard; what could have been done more unto my Vineyard, that I have not done in it? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth Grapes, brought it forth wild Grapes?</HI></Q>
&mdash;Upon which he observes,
<Q>They could easily have answered, that he had not done the <HI>main Thing,</HI> without which all the rest was Nothing, and that he had no more put it in their Power to bring forth Grapes, than to create a new World.</Q>
Page 23.</P>
<P>It's sad to consider, how triflingly and impertinently Men will rea|son, to serve an Hypothesis! For, had not these, God's ancient Peo|ple, the Powers of Nature and common <HI>Grace,</HI> besides the distinguish|ing Privileges of his Sanctuary and Ordinances? And were not these <HI>sufficient</HI> to have enabled them (without the special renewing Influences of the Spirit) to reform their abominable <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and those horrid Impieties, which abounded among them?&mdash; Were not these <HI>sufficient</HI> (without special Grace) to have put them upon the diligent Use of the <HI>Means</HI> of Conversion; upon earnest Inqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies af|ter God, and Endeavours of Conformity to his Will, and in that Way to have lain at the Foot of sovereign Grace, for renewing or saving Influences?&mdash; And had not God the highest Reason to ex|postulate with, and complain of them, that they did not bring forth <HI>these Grapes,</HI> which were justly to be expected; considering the Ex|pence, which he had laid out upon them, and especially considering, that <HI>all</HI> was done, that <HI>needed</HI> to be done, or that even <HI>could</HI> be done, to produce those Effects?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> proceeds to argue:
<Q>In the Parable of the <HI>Sower,</HI> of four Sorts of Ground, but one was <HI>fruitful</HI>: Now, what made the Difference, arose from the <HI>Soil,</HI> as our Lord explains it.</Q>
&mdash; Very well! but <HI>Who</HI> was it that specially <HI>enrich'd</HI> that particular Soil, and made it fruitful above the rest? It is most certain, that all Men by Nature are like a <HI>barren Heath,</HI> uncapable as of them|selves to bring forth any good Fruit; and our Saviour accordingly tells us, Joh. xv.4, 5. <HI>As the Branch cannot bear Fruit, of it self; except it abide in the Vine: no more can ye, except ye abide in me. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much Fruit: for without me ye can do nothing</HI>; or can produce no Fruit. &mdash; <HI>I have chosen you,&mdash; that you should go and bring forth Fruit, and that your Fruit should remain.</HI>&mdash; Here then we see, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="45" REF="005761_0043_0000000000000000">
distinguishing Fruitfulness of one more than another, is derived from an Union to Christ, and from his free and sovereign Grace.</P>
<P>We have one Argument more in the Way, which Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> (it seems) dare venture his Eternity upon; and this is, that
<Q>his Doc|trine certainly yields greater <HI>Encouragement</HI> to all Men to strive for eternal Life, than that which teaches, that it is a mere arbitrary Act of God which secures Salvation to Men; and that their own Endeavours do neither hinder nor promote their Salvation: Which Notion if I should once entertain, I am sure, I should with good Reason <HI>cast off</HI> all Care and Solicitude for my <HI>eternal</HI> Interest; and strive to be contented with the <HI>secret</HI> and <HI>decretive</HI> Will of God, whatever it might appear to be, when I come into the eternal World.</Q></P>
<P>It is a soft Answer to this, and to much more of the like Kind fre|quently occurring in his Sermon, to observe, that it is a very unjust, abusive and bitter <HI>Invective,</HI> against the Doctrine which he is pleased to oppose.&mdash; For who ever supposed, that
"our own Endeavours neither hinder nor promote our Salvation?"
Don't the <HI>Calvinist</HI> Divines constantly teach, agreeable to the Oracles of God, that the Duties of Religion belong to the Way of Salvation, as God has ap|pointed them in Order to the seeking of special Grace, in a diligent Attendance on them, and that we have no Reason nor Encouragement to hope ever to experience the special Influences of the Spirit, in any other Way? That although God be sovereign in <HI>giving a new Heart and a new Spirit,</HI> and in <HI>causing us to walk in his Statutes and keep his Iudgments, and do them</HI>; and does this <HI>not for our Sakes, but for his own Name's Sake: Yet he will be inquired of by the House of</HI> Israel <HI>to do this for them?</HI> Ezek. xxxvi.25, 26, 32, 37.&mdash; And the Sove|reignty of God is so far from a Discouragement to Diligence in Duty, that it ought to be improved as a most forceable Incentive to it: And the Apostle accordingly urges it, as a Motive to active Diligence, Phil. ii.12, 13. <HI>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trem|bling:</HI> FOR <HI>it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good Pleasure.</HI>&mdash; If we lie at Mercy, we should most earnestly implore it. If God only can help us, we should the more diligently seek Help from him. If we are Bankrupts and depend upon Alms for our Subsistence, we should therefore <HI>seek,</HI> that we may obtain. If we are condemn'd Malefactors, and none but the Prince can forgive us, we should the more earnestly petition him for a Pardon.&mdash; But if Sinners are too proud and stout, to acknowledge a glorious God the sovereign Donor of his own Favours, and to lie at the Footstool of his Mercy: if they will run into those desperate Conclusions, which Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> here tells us he would do, and as he thinks, with good Reason, then they may expect, that the righteous God will leave them to the dire Effects of their own Pride and Contumacy. He
<PB N="46" REF="005761_0044_0000000000000000">
will finally convince them of his Sovereignty, as well as Justice, whe|ther they will now submit to it, or no.</P>
<P>Thus I have taken Notice, I think, of every Thing in this Sermon, which has so much as the Appearance of an Argument, in Favour of the
"Sufficiency of common Grace for Salvation."
I have indeed passed over many Things, which are justly exceptionable: but I think, Nothing which he could suppose to have any direct Tendency to the Confirmation of his Hypothesis.&mdash; And now let all serious and conscientious Persons judge, whether their Duty and Interest don't oblige 'em, to leave the glorious GOD in Possession of his So|vereignty, without finding. Fault, and without quarrelling the Equity of his Dispensations. Let them judge, whether it don't become such sinful Worms as we, humbly to acknowledge, that God has a just Claim to absolute Liberty in the Exercise of his Grace, to <HI>have Mercy upon whom he will have Mercy</HI>; and with humble Abasement of Soul to prostrate themselves as guilty Criminals at his Feet, imploring Mercy for his Name's Sake, for his Son's Sake, and not for theirs; acknowledging, that if they are rejected and left to perish in their Sins, God is just, and they deservedly miserable: But that if they are saved, it must be from the infinite Riches of free unmerited and forfeited Mercy.&mdash; Let them judge, who know what vital Piety means, and have had a blessed Experience of the Power of the Holy Ghost in calling them to Christ, whether they are not under most unspeakable Obligations to acknowledge, that the Salvation begun in their Souls is the sole Result of sovereign Grace; owing to no other Cause but God's mere good Pleasure; excited by no other Motive, but <HI>because it so seemed good in his Sight.</HI></P>
<P>Yet there is one Thing in Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Sermon, which I can't conclude without taking a more particular Notice of. And that is, his plainly insinuating, that we are <HI>justified</HI> before God by our own Works. Thus (Page 33.)
<Q>Grace <HI>saves</HI> us no other Way, but by our obeying the Gospel.</Q>
&mdash;So (Page 31.)
<Q>Now this <HI>Wedding-Garment</HI> is a Temper of Mind and Life agreeable to the Gospel, which like an Ornament or Wedding Garment to the Soul, makes it FIT to appear <HI>before God,</HI> in the Company of Saints and An|gels.</Q>
&mdash; So likewise (Page 37.)
<Q>Let us labour to excel in all moral and christian <HI>Virtues,</HI> in which is FOUNDED the eternal Happiness of a rational Creature.</Q></P>
<P>He does not indeed explain himself and inform us, what this Obedience to the Gospel is, what this Temper of Mind and Life, or what these moral and christian Vertues are, which <HI>save us,</HI> which <HI>make us fit to appear before God,</HI> and <HI>upon which our eternal Happiness i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> founded.</HI>&mdash; But I think, let them be taken in what Sense he pleases, this Doctrine is directly subversive of the whole Tenor of the Gospel, and of the Method of Reconciliation therein proposed.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="005761_0045_0000000000000000">If our blessed Saviour be <HI>the Lord our Righteousness</HI> (as in Jer. xxiii.6.) If <HI>we are justified freely by God's Grace, through the Redemption which is in Christ Iesus</HI> (as in Rom. iii.24) If it be <HI>not by Works of Righteousness which we have done, but according to his Mercy he saveth us</HI> (as in Tit. iii.5.) then we are not saved <HI>by</HI> our Obedience to the Gospel; nor will any Temper of Mind, or Life agreeable, serve for a <HI>Wedding-Garment</HI> to the Soul, to make it fit to <HI>appear before God</HI>: Our eternal Happiness is then <HI>founded</HI> upon CHRIST'S <HI>Righteousness</HI> only, and not upon our moral or christian Vertues.</P>
<P>If <HI>to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the Ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteousness</HI> (as in Rom. iv.5) If it be <HI>not of Works, that we are saved, lest any Man should boast</HI> (as in Eph. ii.9) And if <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Works,</HI> are directly contrary one to the other (as in <HI>Rom.</HI> xi.6) then we are not <HI>saved by</HI> our Obedience to the Gospel, <HI>by</HI> any Temper of Mind, or Tenor of Life, we have or can have&punc; nor is our eternal Happiness <HI>founded</HI> upon our moral and christian Vertues.&mdash;It is surprizing, that a Man of Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Character can teach Doctrines so directly repugnant to the whole Oeconomy of our Salvation by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> tells us,
<Q>Certainly he (<HI>the Apostle</HI>) did not mean to ex|clude our Faith, Repentance, Charity, and other Fruits of the Spi|rit, from being necessary to, or bearing a Part in our eternal Life.</Q>
But I answer, Certainly he did mean to exclude all these, as they are Works of our own, (though not from being necessary to, yet) from being any Manner of procuring Cause of our Salvation, or bearing a Part (as Works of ours) in <HI>justifying,</HI> and <HI>intitling</HI> us to Life eternal.</P>
<P>He further observes, that
<Q>by <HI>Works</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> means the <HI>Works</HI> of the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> and all such <HI>Works</HI> whereby Men pretend to claim the <HI>Reward,</HI> not of Favour and Courtesy, but of <HI>Debt.</HI></Q>
&mdash; I would here inquire of Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> whether if God has promised to <HI>save us by our Obedience,</HI> he is not indebted to us, to make that Promise good, upon our performing of that Obedience, whatever <HI>Proportion</HI> there may be, between the <HI>Work</HI> and the promised <HI>Re|ward?</HI> And if the <HI>Condition</HI> be <HI>Works,</HI> of whatever Value the <HI>Works</HI> be, is not the Fulfilment of the Obligation, <HI>due</HI> to him who has done the Work, and perform'd the Condition?</P>
<P>I shall now conclude these my <HI>Remarks,</HI> with a brief Expostulation with those of Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Disposition, who, not content with embra|cing these dangerous Opinions themselves, are so fond of making Proselytes. &mdash; Bear with me, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> while I address you in a few Words; and briefly inquire into the Grounds of this Conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="005761_0046_0000000000000000">You will perhaps plead, that you can't <HI>believe,</HI> contrary to the <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Evidence</HI> that appears to your selves.&mdash; But why so fond of making Proselytes of those&punc; who by your own Principles, are already (if they live up to the Articles of their Faith) in a more cer|tain State of Safety, than you can with any Modesty pretend to.&mdash; They have common <HI>Grace,</HI> as well as you: Their Prnciiples as much influence them not to receive the Grace of God <HI>in vain</HI>; and as much teach them the Necessity of <HI>Holiness,</HI> as yours can do. And if they walk worthy of their Principles, you must acknowledge, that though their Sentiments may be wrong, their Souls are safe. And though they may have Cause to reflect at the Bar of Christ, that they have had a more lowly Sense of their own Impotence and Unwor|thiness, than there was Occasion for, and have done more Honour to the Sovereignty of God's Grace, than they were oblig'd to: Yet they have comply'd with the Terms of the Gospel, and will there|fore be accepted of their righteous Judge.&mdash; These (Gentlemen) are Consequences naturally deduced from your own Principles. &mdash; But now, if the Case be as the whole Reformation has voted it, that <HI>you</HI> are greatly mistaken, and that you deny that Submission to the Righteousness of Christ, and that Acknowledgment of the free and sovereign Grace of God in him, which the Gospel makes the Terms of your Acceptance with God, and of your eternal Salvation, you can't but know how dreadful the Consequence must be in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> great Day of Trial.&mdash; Suffer me, Gentlemen, to tell you, that ten thousand Worlds would not tempt <HI>me</HI> to venture my Soul upon the Foundation, you are so earnestly perswading poor Sinners to build their eternal Hope upon.</P>
<P>You may perhaps pretend, you are <HI>certain</HI> that you are in the <HI>right,</HI> and <HI>cannot</HI> be mistaken.&mdash; But would not common Modesty put you upon considering, That besides the Church of <HI>England,</HI> the whole <HI>Reformation</HI> in general have all along been, and still are pro|fessedly of a contrary Mind to you; That very many of these have taken as much Pains to inquire into this Cause, were at least as capable Judges, and have as good a Claim to Certainty, as your selves: And that these have seen the whole Tenor of the Gospel, in the plainest and strongest Language, opposing your Principles?</P>
<P>You may perhaps pretend, that the Doctrines of <HI>special Grace,</HI> as held by the <HI>Calvinists,</HI> are destructive of a religious and godly <HI>Life.</HI> &mdash; But you must know (how inconsistent soever you may suppose their Principles) that the <HI>Calvinists</HI> constantly teach the Necessity of <HI>Sanctification,</HI> in Order to final Salvation; and that <HI>without Holiness no Man shall</HI> or <HI>can see the Lord.</HI> And it is a notorious Fact, which cannot justly be disputed, that the Practice of Piety towards God, and Righteousness toward Men, prevails as much (at least) among those of the <HI>Calvinian,</HI> as among others of the <HI>Arminian</HI> Perswasion; yea, that the more humbly sensible of his own Impotence and No|thingness,

any Man is, and the firmer Trust he has in Christ for Grace, Mercy, and Peace, so much the more godly, righteous, sober, and watchful will his Conversation be. &mdash;While on the contrary, it has been an old Observation, too constantly verified, that the most zeal|ous Patrons of the <HI>Sufficiency</HI> of <HI>common Grace,</HI> and of our <HI>Iustifica|tion by Works,</HI> have been generally very far from confirming or com|mending their Principles, by their Conversations.</P>

<HEAD>A VINDICATION <HI>Of</HI> GOD's <HI>sovereign free Grace,</HI> in some STRICTURES upon Mr. <HI>Henry Caner</HI>'s SERMON, from <HI>Matth.</HI> vii.28, 29. Intitled, <HI>The true Nature and Method of christian Preaching.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I had finished my Remarks upon Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Sermon, I had two other Pamphlets put into my Hands, written with the same Design as the Sermon already considered. The one of them intitled, <HI>The Nature and Method of christian Preaching</HI>; the other, <HI>A Letter concerning the Sovereignty and Promises of God.</HI> The former of these, written by Mr. <HI>Henry Caner</HI>: The latter (as I am well informed) by Dr. <HI>Samuel Iohnson.</HI>&mdash; Though I can't but conclude, that what I have already said in Answer to Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> is a sufficient Refutation of whatever occurs in these Discourses, if pro|perly applied: Yet there being some Things here plausibly offered, which will be likely to stumble the unwary and injudicious Reader, and lead him off from the true Foundation of his Hope and Safety, it is thought needful, that there be some general View given of the false Foundation, upon which those Discourses are built, and of their dangerous Tendency to the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>I shall begin with some brief Reflections upon Mr. CANER'S SER|MON; the professed Design of which is, to instruct us in the true Method of Preaching: But if he himself has mistaken his Way, our Saviour's Observation (Matth. xv.14.) must take Place, <HI>If the Blind lead the Blind, both shall fall into the Ditch.</HI> &mdash; Whether this be so, or not, comes under immediate Consideration.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="005761_0049_0000000000000000">The Sum of what Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> endeavours to prove, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is, that according to the Method of our blessed Saviour's and his Apostles Preaching, <HI>when we preach to the unconverted Heathen World, Repen|tance of their former wicked Life, and Faith in Christ, are the only proper necessary Doctrines, to be inculcated upon such Men as these.</HI> (Page 14.) But when we preach to those <HI>who are already Christians, who have professed their Faith in Christ, and have been received into his Church by Baptism, we should intirely change our Applications; and no longer now insist upon Faith, but Practice.</HI></P>
<P>He says but little to illustrate the first of these Propositions; nor was there any Occasion that he should, it being on all Hands allowed for Truth. But he is large and particular in his Endeavours to confirm the latter Proposition: With what Success, I am now to inquire.</P>
<P>He begins with urging the <HI>Pattern</HI> of CHRIST himself: And his Evidence here is thus proposed.
<Q>First (says he) let us consider the Example of our blessed <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Preaching, as it is exhibited to us in this <HI>Sermon</HI> (the <HI>Sermon</HI> on the <HI>Mount,</HI>) of which Mention is made in my Text. For though he taught upon many other Oc|casions, both in publick and private; yet we have <HI>no compleat publick Sermon of his,</HI> besides this which is here recorded.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And the first Thing remarkable in this <HI>Sermon</HI> is, that it is <HI>a|dapted</HI> to his Hearers, that is, his <HI>Disciples.</HI> For though there was a <HI>mixt Multitude,</HI> that now heard him: Yet his Discourse was chiefly directed to his <HI>Disciples.</HI> (P. 8.) &mdash; These Men having already made <HI>Profession</HI> of CHRIST, and yielded up them|selves to become his hearty and sincere Followers, and being re|ceived by him as Members of his Body, or of that Church which he came to establish, and whereof he himself is the Head, did not <HI>need</HI> a Discourse about <HI>Faith,</HI> nor an Exhortation about <HI>coming to</HI> CHRIST, so much as proper Instructions in Regard to their Con|duct and Behaviour as Christians.</Q>
(P. 11.)</P>
<P>This is the Sum of his Reasoning upon this Head, in his own Words. From whence these several Things offer to our Conside|ration and Inquiry.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether Christ's <HI>Sermon</HI> on the <HI>Mount</HI> was especially addressed to the twelve <HI>Disciples,</HI> and accommodated to their Circumstances; and not to the Circumstances of the vast <HI>Multitude,</HI> which attended it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether there be no compleat publick <HI>Sermon</HI> of our Lord's, besides this in the <HI>Mount,</HI> recorded by the Evangelists.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="52" REF="005761_0050_0000000000000000">3. Whether when our Saviour preached to his twelve <HI>Disciples</HI> only, just before his Crucifixion, he did not inculcate upon them the Necessity of their <HI>Faith</HI> in him. And,</P>
<P N="4">4. Whether our blessed Saviour did not insist upon <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Re|pentance,</HI> in the <HI>whole Course</HI> of his Ministry.&mdash; These Things duly consider'd will set the Case in a proper Light.</P>
<P>I am first then to consider, whether this <HI>Sermon</HI> upon the <HI>Mount</HI> was especially addressed to the twelve <HI>Disciples,</HI> and accommodated to their Circumstances; but not to the Circumstances of the <HI>Multitude,</HI> which attended it.&mdash; Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> takes it for granted, that this <HI>Ser|mon</HI> was chiefly directed to Christ's own <HI>Disciples</HI> (the <HI>Twelve</HI> he must mean, if he would speak pertinently) and builds all his Reasoning upon this <HI>Postulatum.</HI> That <HI>these Disciples had already received him as their Master, and listed themselves as his Followers.</HI> (Page 8.) <HI>Had already received him by Faith; and professed their Dependance upon him.</HI> (Page 14.) Therefore <HI>to these he gives such Directions as might govern their Lives; and make it evident, they did not receive their Religion in vain.</HI> (Page 8.) <HI>To these he preached the Doctrine of new Obedience; and exhorted them to live suitably to their holy Calling.</HI> (Page 14.) &mdash; Now will there upon Examination be found any Manner of Founda|tion for all this?&mdash; Does not the Text assure us, it was upon <HI>see|ing the</HI> MULTITUDES, <HI>he went up into the Mountain</HI>; that seating himself upon the Summit, so great a Multitude might (by the De|clivity of the Hill) have the Advantage to sit in a Semi-Circle at his Feet, according to their Custom of attending upon the Teachings of the Jewish Doctors in that Day. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d. <HI>Godwin</HI>'s Moses <HI>and</HI> Aaron. <HI>Lib.</HI> 1. Chap. 7.</NOTE>&mdash; By <HI>his Disciples coming to him,</HI> I think, we are not to understand the <HI>Twelve,</HI> who were not yet called to be his <HI>Followers</HI>: but the <HI>Multitude</HI> mention'd in the fore|going Part of the Verse, who approached to him as <HI>Disciples</HI> or <HI>Learners</HI> were wont to do to the <HI>Iewish</HI> Doctors, to sit at his Feet, and attend his Doctrine. They are called <HI>Disciples,</HI> not in the special and appropriate, but general and lax Sense of the Word, as they were now waiting on his Instruction and Discipline.&mdash; This seems the natural and necessary Construction of the Passage.&mdash; For what Sense can be made of our Saviour's going to the Top of a <HI>Mountain,</HI> for the Sake of the <HI>Multitudes,</HI> when he designed to appropriate or specially direct his Address to his twelve <HI>Disciples,</HI> whom he could have as conveniently instructed in a House, or on a Plain any where, as upon the Top of a Mountain?&mdash; It is therefore certain, both from the Text and from the Nature of the Thing, that he chose that Situation, that the <HI>Multitude</HI> might conveniently attend and hear him. And what puts this beyond Dispute, is, that the <HI>Twelve Dis|ciples</HI> were not yet called to be his constant Attendants and Followers; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. We find indeed, by the 21st Verse of the foregoing
<PB N="53" REF="005761_0051_0000000000000000">
Chapter, that the first <HI>four</HI> were now newly called to <HI>follow</HI> him. And it appears from <HI>Mark</HI> i.17,&mdash;45. that there were no other <HI>Disciples</HI> in constant Attendance upon him, when this <HI>Multitude</HI> resort|ed to him, but <HI>Simon, Andrew, Iames,</HI> and <HI>Iohn.</HI> The same is also evident from <HI>Luke</HI> v.10,&mdash;15. In which Places our Lord's several Transactions from the Time of his calling these four <HI>Disciples,</HI> to the Convention of this <HI>Multitude,</HI> are particularly related: and we may justly suppose, it was a considerable Time before any other of the <HI>Twelve</HI> were called, as his stated Attendants.&mdash; I might moreover observe, that Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>'s Text serves further to illustrate this Mat|ter,. It was the <HI>People</HI> (the <HI>Multitude</HI>) that were <HI>astonished at his Doctrine,</HI> and consequently to them was the <HI>Sermon</HI> directed; and upon them did our blessed Lord <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">signedly</HI> impress it with such Power, as excited their Approbation and Admiration. &mdash; All those Remarks therefore upon our Lord's <HI>accommodating</HI> his Discourse to his <HI>Disciples,</HI> who had already listed themselves as his Followers, received him as their Master, received him by Faith, &amp;c. are merely imaginary &amp; trifling.</P>
<P>The true State of the Case seems to be this. &mdash; The <HI>Multitude</HI> were struck with a Conviction, that <HI>Iesus</HI> was their expected <HI>Messiah,</HI> and from thence filled with an Apprehension, that he would quickly assume that <HI>temporal</HI> Dominion and Grandeur, which the <HI>Iews</HI> of that Day imagined necessarily consequent upon the <HI>Messiah</HI>'s Appear|ing. They therefore seem to flock to him, that they may be early in his Service, assist him in his Victories, and secure a Part in the Glory and Magnificence of his <HI>Kingdom.</HI>&mdash; He accordingly adapts his Discourse, to check these their ambitious Views; corrects their Mis|takes, and shews them, that instead of this temporal Pomp and Gran|deur, Riches and Honours, Conquests and Triumphs, in which they hoped to be happy, true <HI>Blessedness</HI> consists in the <HI>Seeing of God,</HI> and enjoying the Honours, Privileges and Blessings of the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> which is spiritual and heavenly: And that the Characters of the <HI>bless|ed Man</HI> are such as these, Poverty of Spirit, Meekness, Self-Denial, Patience, Love to all Men, Forgiveness of Enemies, and universal Conformity to the Will of God.&mdash; If any would see this set in a par|ticular and clear Light, let him read Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI>'s excellent <HI>Para|phrase</HI> upon this Sermon in the Mount.&mdash; Upon the whole then, it is most evident, that this <HI>Sermon</HI> of our Lord's doth afford no Foun|dation at all for that Method of Preaching, which Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> attempts to establish upon it. But all his Pretences of our Saviour's preaching <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> to those only who were not brought over to the christian Profession, and <HI>changing his Applications,</HI> to those who had already received him, are meerly chimerical, without the least Coun|tenance from his Text and Context; or indeed from any Thing else in the whole Gospels.</P>
<P>I'm aware, that it may be objected against this Reasoning, that where this same Sermon is recorded in the sixth Chapter of <HI>Luke,</HI> we
<PB N="54" REF="005761_0052_0000000000000000">
are assured, that the twelve <HI>Disciples</HI> were previously chosen; and were all personally Auditors of this Discourse.&mdash; But, I think it certain, that the <HI>Sermon</HI> recorded in <HI>Luke,</HI> was preached at another Time, and upon another Occasion (probably of a like Kind with what has been just consider'd) and was not the same Discourse, though some of the same Things occur in it.&mdash; This is evident from the Discourse it self; the greatest Part of what is recorded in <HI>Matthew,</HI> not being found in <HI>Luke. Matthew</HI> records nine Beati|tudes: <HI>Luke</HI> but four, and with considerable <HI>Variation</HI> from <HI>Matthew.</HI> And on the other Hand, there is a Variety of Things in <HI>Luke,</HI> particularly three Verses together, wherein <HI>Woes</HI> are denounced, of which <HI>Matthew</HI> saith Nothing.&mdash; Besides, the <HI>Multitude,</HI> which at|tended the Sermon recorded by <HI>Matthew,</HI> came from <HI>Galilee, Deca|polis, Ierusalem, Iudea,</HI> and from beyond <HI>Iordan.</HI> Whereas those men|tion'd by <HI>Luke,</HI> came from <HI>Iudea, Ierusalem,</HI> and the <HI>Sea-Coast of Tyre and Sidon.</HI>&mdash; And what puts it beyond all Doubt is, that according to <HI>Matthew</HI>'s Narrative, our Lord took the <HI>Multitude</HI> with him to the Top of the Mountain: But according to <HI>Luke</HI>'s Report, he took his <HI>Disciples</HI> only into the Mountain, and continued with them there all Night in Prayer to God; and met with the Multitude in the Plain, after his Descent from the Mountain. According to <HI>Matthew</HI>'s Ac|count, the <HI>Sermon</HI> recorded by him was delivered upon the <HI>Mountain</HI>: But according to <HI>Luke</HI>'s History, he stood upon a <HI>Plain,</HI> after he came down from the <HI>Mountain,</HI> when he preached the Sermon there record|ed. Luke vi.17. &mdash; Thus we see, that the very Foundation of Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>'s Sermon is but a mere Quicksand: and what then must become of his pompous Superstructure?</P>
<P>I am next to consider, whether there be <HI>no compleat publick Sermon</HI> of our Blessed LORD'S, besides this in the <HI>Mount,</HI> recorded by the Evangelists.&mdash; This Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> denies; insinuating thereby, that this <HI>Sermon</HI> is the <HI>only Pattern,</HI> which can be taken from our blessed Saviour's Preaching, to guide us in our Addresses to those, who are already professed Christians.&mdash; But how came Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> to make this egregious Blunder?&mdash; Did he never read the <HI>sixth</HI> and the <HI>tenth</HI> Chapters of <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Gospel? Were not they <HI>publick Sermons,</HI> that are there recorded? Have we not as much Evidence, that they were <HI>compleat Sermons,</HI> as we have with Respect to this <HI>Sermon</HI> in the <HI>Mount?</HI> Were not Christ's <HI>Twelve Disciples</HI> present, when he preach|ed them? And (what is full to the present Purpose) were not those whole Discourses upon the Nature, Necessity and blessed Consequences of <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, of an Interest in and Union to him, and on the dangerous State of <HI>Unbelievers</HI>?&mdash; Some of his <HI>Disciples</HI> indeed were prejudiced against Discourses of such a Tenor. They concluded (no Doubt) with some of the present Times, that it was not a proper Method of Preaching to professed Christians; and therefore <HI>went back, and walked no more with him.</HI> Joh. vi.66.&mdash; Such publick <HI>Sermons,</HI> however, our Lord did see Cause to preach, whether his
<PB N="55" REF="005761_0053_0000000000000000">
<HI>Disciples</HI> were pleased, or displeased with them. And therefore Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>'s Remark, that we have no compleat publick <HI>Sermon</HI> of his, besides that in the <HI>Mount,</HI> is certainly a very gross Mistake in Point of History.</P>
<P>But supposing it were Fact, that we have no Instance of any <HI>public Sermon</HI> preach'd by our blessed LORD to his professed <HI>Disciples,</HI> upon the Doctrines of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI>; will it not be as repugnant to Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>'s Scheme, if we can find a <HI>private Sermon</HI> of our Lord's, preach'd to his <HI>Disciples,</HI> wherein these Doctrines are insisted upon? His Business was to prove, that quite <HI>other</HI> Doctrine than <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI> was necessary, to those who had already received Christ by Faith, and submitted to him as a Mediator and Guide (Page 14.) And that this was <HI>constantly</HI> exemplified in our LORD'S Preaching.&mdash; What then must become of this fine Speculation, if it appears, that when our Lord preached to his twelve <HI>Disciples only,</HI> and that too in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>last Sermon</HI> they ever heard from his Mouth (certainly therefore after they had <HI>received him by Faith, and professed their Dependance upon him as their Mediator and Guide</HI>) the Doctrine of <HI>Faith</HI> in him, of Union to him by <HI>Faith,</HI> of the Fruits of <HI>Faith,</HI> and of the Peace and Consolation that should flow from <HI>Faith</HI> in him, were the <HI>chief Sub|jects</HI> of his Discourse! That this was so in Fact, cannot be debated by any one who will read the xivth, xvth, and xvith Chapters of <HI>Iohn.</HI>&mdash; In a Word, what was the Spirit and Scope of our Lord's <HI>Parables,</HI> in general? Was it not to teach <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance?</HI> And were not his <HI>Parables</HI> principally design'd for his <HI>Disciples</HI> Use? See <HI>Matth.</HI> xlii.11.&mdash; From whence it follows, that as the Facts alledged by Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> are meer Imagination<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> without any Appear|ance of Truth, the Consequences he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">uced from them, must be of the same airy Nature with the Premises, on which he argues.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, I think, it must appear to every one who won't shut his Eyes against the Light, that although our blessed SA|VIOUR preached upon a great Variety of other Subjects, and thereby has set an Example to those who minister in his Name, to bring out of their Treasure Things new and old: Yet the <HI>chief</HI> Subjects insisted upon in the whole Course of his Ministry, were the Doc|trines of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> or what depended upon them, led to them, and was necessary to the Description, Illustration and Enforce|ment of those important Points.&mdash; Thus he began his Ministry, <HI>Matth.</HI> iv.17, 23.&mdash; Thus he <HI>continued</HI> it; as appears from the Gospel of <HI>Iohn,</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Ioh.</HI> iii. from ver. 14, to the 22d.&mdash; <HI>Chap.</HI> iv. ver. 10, to 26.&mdash; <HI>Chap.</HI> v.19, to 47.&mdash; <HI>Chap.</HI> vi.27, to 65.&mdash;<HI>Chap.</HI> vii.37. &amp;c.&mdash; <HI>Chap.</HI> viii.12, to 28.&mdash; <HI>Chap.</HI> ix.35, to 39. <HI>Chap.</HI> x. throughout.&mdash; <HI>Chap.</HI> xii.31, to 37. and 44, to 50. And <HI>Chapters</HI> xiv, xv, xvi. throughout.</NOTE> where his Discourses are more fully and particu|larly
<PB N="56" REF="005761_0054_0000000000000000">
represented.&mdash; Thus he <HI>concluded</HI> it; in the <HI>Sermon</HI> above-cited, the <HI>last</HI> which he ever preached while resident among Men.&mdash; And these were the Doctrines, which without any Reserves, Limita|tions or Distinctions, he recommended to his Disciples, to <HI>preach</HI> also, when he commissioned them to go forth, and preach the Gospel in his Name. See <HI>Mark</HI> xvi.15, 16. and <HI>Luke</HI> xxiv.47.&mdash; And as the Apostles well understood his Meaning, they preached accordingly: <HI>testifying both to</HI> Jews <HI>and</HI> Greeks, <HI>Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Iesus Christ.</HI> See Acts xiii.38, 39. and Chap. xx.21. With many other Places.&mdash; For <HI>his Ministers</HI> therefore (under whatever Pretence) to <HI>neglect</HI> insisting upon <HI>these</HI> important Points, as essentially necessary to a well grounded Hope of Salvation, and as what alone will be productive of true Holiness in Heart and Life, is to <HI>deviate</HI> from the <HI>Pattern</HI> given them by the great Head of their Order, to counteract the Design of their Mission, to impoverish their Ministry, and to starve the Souls of their Hearers.</P>
<P>Thus I have briefly examined the Evidence Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> has pretend|ed to produce, from the Tenor of our blessed <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Ministry. &mdash; And the Reader must now judge, whether there be any Foundation for his Reasoning, or any Safety in his Scheme of Christian Preach|ing.&mdash; After all, I know it's the Opinion of some judicious Divines, that not so much CHRIST'S own personal Ministry, as that of his <HI>Apo|stles,</HI> under the Dispensation of the SPIRIT, which follow'd his As|cension, is to be consider'd as the proper <HI>Standard</HI> of Christian Preach|ing: And as they observe, a <HI>Mistake</HI> about the Design of CHRIST'S dwelling so much on the <HI>Law</HI> in his own Preaching, may be of <HI>dan|gerous</HI> Consequence, in many Regards.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this distinctly represented in an excellent Anonymous Book, lately publish'd, and ascrib'd to Dr. WATTS; Intitled, <HI>Orthodoxy and Charity united.</HI> ESSAY III. Sect. V. <HI>Pag.</HI> 54. &amp;c.&mdash; Compar'd with <HI>Pages</HI> 28, 119, 125, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>I am next to consider, whether Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>'s Scheme of Preaching will receive any better Countenance or Support from the Example of the APOSTLES.</P>
<P>Previous to a distinct Examination of this, it should be observed, that it is not the Question, whether the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their Epistles to the Churches, taught the Necessity of Morality, Obedience, and Holi|ness; this is granted by every Body, and needs no Proof.&mdash; The Ministry of the present Age have undoubtedly an Example set before them in the <HI>Apostolick,</HI> to <HI>affirm constantly, that they who have believ|ed in God, should be careful to maintain good Works.</HI> And I can't ima|gine, to what Purpose, are those numerous Quotations in the Margin of Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>'s Sermon to prove this.&mdash; I would further premise, that I have no Controversy with this Gentleman, about the chief Points
<PB N="57" REF="005761_0055_0000000000000000">
of <HI>Doctrine</HI> insisted on by the <HI>Apostles,</HI> in what he calls the <HI>first</HI> Period of their Preaching, from our Saviour's Ascension unto the Settlement of Churches and Societies of Christians. I agree with him&punc; that
<Q>the Points then chiefly insisted on were these, <HI>Christ crucified, Iesus</HI> and <HI>the Resurrection, Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance, Putting on Christ,</HI> being <HI>bap|tized into Christ,</HI> and the like.</Q></P>
<P>But then the Question is, Whether during what he calls
<Q>the <HI>se|cond</HI> Period of their Labours, which they exercised towards those who were already <HI>Christians,</HI> who had professed their Faith in Christ, and had been received into his Church by Baptism, we shall then find that they intirely <HI>changed their Applications</HI>; and <HI>no longer</HI> now insisted upon <HI>Faith,</HI> but <HI>Practice,</HI> the Duties we owe to God, our selves, and one another?</Q>
As he assures us, the Case was. (Page 17.)</P>
<P>The only Method to set this Matter in a fair and just Light, is to take a general View of the several <HI>Epistles,</HI> written by the Apostles to the Churches; and see whether in them, or in any of them, they in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t upon <HI>Faith in Christ,</HI> as well as upon Practice of the Duties we owe to God, to our selves, and to one another.&mdash;If upon Exami|nation it is found, that this is the Case in Fact, in any of the <HI>Epistles</HI> written to the Professors of <HI>Christianity,</HI> who were received into the Gospel Church, it must necessarily teach us the Impertinence of Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>'s Reasoning, and the dangerous Tendency of his Doctrine in the Sermon before us.</P>
<P>To consider these <HI>Epistles</HI> in their Order, as placed in the Bible, I begin with the <HI>Epistle</HI> to the ROMANS. That this <HI>Epistle</HI> was di|rected to those who <HI>professed their Faith in Christ,</HI> appears beyond Debate, from Chap. i. ver. 7, 8. <HI>To all that be in</HI> Rome, <HI>beloved of God, called to be Saints.&mdash; I thank my God through Iesus Christ for you all, that your Faith is spoken of through the whole World.</HI>&mdash; That the main Scope of this <HI>Epistle</HI> is, to prove the Necessity of <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, in Order to our Justification before God, and our Progress in a Life of holy Conformity to his Will, must appear in a Meridian Light to every careful Reader.&mdash; This is summarily proposed, Chap. i. ver. 17. <HI>For therein is the Righteousness of God revealed, from Faith to Faith; as it is written, The Iust shall live by Faith.</HI>&mdash; This is particularly proved, from the Impotence and Guilt both of <HI>Iew</HI> and <HI>Gentile,</HI> in the <HI>three</HI> first Chapters. And from thence is this Conclu|sion drawn in the 28th Verse of the iiid Chapter, <HI>Therefore we con|clude, that a Man is justified by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law.</HI> &mdash; This Conclusion is strongly ratified and confirmed throughout the ivth Chapter, by the Examples of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> whose <HI>Faith was imputed to them for Righteousness.</HI>&mdash; The Manner in which we are Partakers of the Righteousness of Christ by <HI>Faith,</HI> is repre|sented in the vth Chapter.&mdash; The State, Character, and Hope of <HI>Be|lievers</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="005761_0056_0000000000000000">
is set before us, in the vi, vii, and viiith Chapters.&mdash; The Sovereignty of God in the Donation of his Grace, is the Subject of the ix and xith Chapters.&mdash; The Difference between the Righteous|ness of the <HI>Law</HI> and the Righteousness of <HI>Faith,</HI> is represented in the xth Chapter. &mdash; And some practical Reflections made upon the whole, in the remaining Part of the Epistle. This is a just Representation of the Case; and must not all the World vote that Man very tho't|less and inattentive (to say no worse) who will venture to publish i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for Fact, that with Respect to those who professed their <HI>Faith in</HI> Christ, the Apostles <HI>intirely changed their Applications!

<P>I proceed now to consider the two <HI>Epistles</HI> to the CORINTHIANS: And to see whether in them, the Apostle does not insist upon <HI>Faith,</HI> as well as Practice. &mdash; Though the first of these was written on a special Occasion, to rebuke their Factions and Contentions, their A|buse of their spiritual Gifts, and their Profanation of the Lord's Sup|per; and to answer some Letters, containing sundry Questions, relat|ing to Marriage and Divorce; whence it's necessary, that these prac|tical Matters should be the principal Subjects treated on: Yet the important Point, which Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> says was <HI>no longer insisted on</HI> by the Apostles, in their Epistles to the Churches, was so far from being neglected or overlook'd, that this Apostle enters immediately upon that Subject, in the very <HI>first</HI> Chapter; mentions the precious Name of CHRIST, not less than seventeen Times in that Chapter&punc; tells 'em, that <HI>Christ crucified</HI> was the great Subject of his Preaching (ver. 23.) That <HI>the Preaching of the Cross</HI> (or Faith in a crucified Saviour) <HI>is to those that are saved, the Power of God</HI>; and that how <HI>wise</HI> soever the unbelieving <HI>Iews</HI> or <HI>Greeks</HI> might be esteem'd by themselves or others, <HI>their Wisdom</HI> was <HI>Foolishness with God,</HI> while the most <HI>weak, foolish</HI> and <HI>contemptible</HI> true Believers were wiser than any of them all; be|cause they <HI>are in Christ Iesus</HI> (are united to him by Faith) <HI>who of God is made u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> us Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption.</HI> (ver. 18. to the End.)&mdash; And in the <HI>second</HI> Chapter, he pursues the same Argument; and shews them, that when personally among them he <HI>came not to them with Excellency of Speech, or Wisdom; but deter|mined to know nothing among them</HI> (to make nothing else the Subject of his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">blick D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">scourses) <HI>but Iesus Christ, and him crucified; that their Faith should not stand in the Wisdom of Men, but in the Power of God.</HI> (from ver. 1, to 5.)&mdash;If then an Account of the Manner and Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct of <HI>his Preaching</HI> may be taken from the <HI>Apostle</HI> himself, the Matter is directly contrary to Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>'s Representation. &mdash; I need not therefore spend Time distinctly to consider the Re|mainder of this <HI>Epistle</HI>; nor the <HI>second Epistle</HI> to the same Church: the Apostle having thus determin'd the Point, with Respect to his Preaching among the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> beyond Debate.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="005761_0057_0000000000000000">If we proceed to consider this Matter, as represented in the <HI>Epistle</HI> to the GALATIANS, it will appear that the great Design of this <HI>Epis|tle</HI> was a Refutation of some such Doctrines as are taught by Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>: with a distinct Proof and Illustration of the important Doc|trine of our <HI>Iustification by Faith in Christ, and not by the Works of the Law.</HI>&mdash; The Apostle begins this <HI>Epistle</HI> with a heavy Complaint of these <HI>Galatians,</HI> for being <HI>so soon removed from the Grace of Christ, unto another Gospel</HI> (that is, for their forsaking the Doctrine of <HI>Ius|tification by Faith, without Works,</HI> as appears from the whole Tenor of the Epistle) and denounces an awful <HI>Curse</HI> against any Man, or Angel from Heaven, that should preach any <HI>other Doctrine</HI> to 'em, than he had preached, and thereby lead them from <HI>the Grace of Christ,</HI> and the Way of Salvation by <HI>Faith, without the Works of the Law.</HI> Chap. i.6, 8.&mdash; A Text that demands the serious and so|lemn Consideration of those Preachers, who follow Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>'s Di|rections, in the <HI>Sermon</HI> now before us.&mdash; The Apostle, after a par|ticular Justification of his Mission to, and Conduct in the Gospel-Mi|nistry, in the Remainder of the first and former Part of the second Chapter, proceeds in the latter Part of the second, and in the third and fourth Chapters, to explain and prove to the <HI>Galatians</HI> the Doc|trine of our <HI>Iustification by Faith, without the Works of the Law</HI>; to shew the Necessity of building all their Hopes of Salvation upon <HI>Ius|tification by Faith alone</HI>; and smartly to expostulate with them, and reprove them, for being so <HI>bewitch'd,</HI> as to depart from this most im|portant Doctrine of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Life.</HI>&mdash; After this, he concludes his <HI>Epistle</HI> by a twofold <HI>Exhortation.</HI> The first is, to <HI>stand fast in the Liberty, wherewith Christ had made them free; and not be entangled again with the Yoke of Bondage.</HI> The second is, to bring forth the <HI>Fruits of the</HI> SPIRIT; and <HI>walk worthy</HI> of their Christian Profession. &mdash; This (though a very brief) is a just View of the main Scope of the <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Galatians.</HI> How astonishing is it therefore, that this <HI>Epistle</HI> should be cited by Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> (Page 19.) to prove, that in the Apostle's Addresses to those <HI>who professed their Faith in Christ, they no longer now insist upon</HI> Faith, <HI>but Practice.</HI>&mdash; This Conduct is exactly parallel to the Papist <HI>Bellarmine</HI>'s Attempt to prove from <HI>Matth.</HI> xxvi.27. <HI>Drink ye all of it,</HI> that the <HI>Cup</HI> in the <HI>Eucharist</HI> must be withheld from the <HI>Laity.</HI>&mdash; Upon the whole, this obvious Re|mark offers it self to Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>'s Consideration, that it greatly con|cerns us all to imitate the Example, which this great Apostle recom|mends to his <HI>Galatians,</HI> to <HI>live the Life which we live in the Flesh, by the</HI> FAITH <HI>of the Son of God, who loved us and gave himself for us</HI>; lest we <HI>frustrate the Grace of God</HI>; since <HI>if Righteousness come by the Law, Christ is dead in vain.</HI> Chap. ii.20, 21.</P>
<P>If we go on to consider the Point in View, as represented in the <HI>Epistle</HI> to the EPHESIANS, we shall find that the Apostle begins that <HI>Epistle,</HI> as the others before consider'd, by distinctly treating upon the Doctrines of <HI>special Grace.</HI>&mdash; His <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce first</HI> Chapters are a particular
<PB N="60" REF="005761_0058_0000000000000000">
and elegant Discourse upon the Grace of God in <HI>Election, Redemption, Vocation, Iustification,</HI> and <HI>Adoption</HI>; wherein he takes frequent Occa|sion to shew 'em, that they were Partakers of all the Benefits of Christ's Redemption, by <HI>Faith</HI> in Jesus Christ; that <HI>he ceased not to give Thanks to God for their Faith in Iesus Christ</HI> (Chap. i.15, 16.) that they were brought to <HI>believe in Christ, by the exceeding Greatness of God's Power, and according to the Working of his mighty Power</HI> (ver&punc; 19.) that <HI>by Grace they were saved, through Faith; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd that not of themselves: it is the Gift of God; not of Works, lest any Man should boast</HI> (Chap. ii.8, 9.) that <HI>they have Boldn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ss &amp; A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cess with Confidence unto God, by the Faith of Christ.</HI> (Chap. iii.17.) With much more to the same Purpose.&mdash; And indeed it is the whole Scope of the <HI>three first</HI> Chap|ters, to shew them what were the Benefits procured for them by <HI>Christ</HI>; and that they must be Partakers of these Benefits by <HI>Faith</HI> in him: And to shew them, that the great Design of his Ministry among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> was to preach <HI>the unsearchable Riches of Christ,</HI> Chap. iii.1&mdash;9.&mdash; The <HI>three l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st</HI> Chapters of this <HI>Epistle</HI> consist of a practical Improvement of the Premises.&mdash; Thus we see, how far this <HI>Epistle</HI> is from justifying the Method of Preaching recommended by our Author.</P>
<P>Should we go on to consider this Affair, as represented in the <HI>Epis|tle</HI> to the PHILIPPIANS, it will equally make against Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>'s Scheme. It is remarkable, that the Apostle is so far from treating of moral Duties only in this Epistle, that the dear Name of CHRIST is mention'd no less than eighteen Times, in the first Chapter. And how joyful, how thankful, does he shew himself, on the Behalf of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se <HI>Philippians,</HI> for <HI>their Fellowship in the Gospel</HI>; and for their Enjoyment of the <HI>preaching of</HI> CHRIST among them? Whether he was preach'd <HI>out of Envy and Strif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, or of good Will; wheth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r in Pre|tence, or in Truth,</HI> CHRIST <HI>was preached; and therein he did r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">joice; yea, and would rejoice.</HI> Chap. i.5, 15 &mdash; 18. &mdash; This was the <HI>Preaching,</HI> that his Heart was set upon; this the <HI>Preaching,</HI> which he peculiarly insists upon, in all his Epistles.&mdash; If we proceed to take a View of the <HI>third</HI> Chapter, the Apostle there purposely handles the very Argument now before us. He there teaches Christians, to <HI>rejoice in Christ Iesus, without Confid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce in the Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh,</HI> ver. 3. He largely and particularly proves from his own Experience, the Defi|ciency of all imaginary Attainments of our own, and of all legal O|bedience; and the Necessity of <HI>esteeming all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se things but Loss, of suffering the Loss of all Things,</HI> and of <HI>esteeming them but Dung, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> may win</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and be found in him; not having our own Righ|teousness, which is of the Law; but that which is through the</HI> FAITH <HI>of Christ, the Righteousn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ss which is of God by</HI> FAITH.&mdash; The ex|plaining and confirming this Point, and improving it against the false Teachers of those Times, is manifestly the Scope of the whole <HI>third</HI> Chapter.&mdash; In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>search,</HI> he concludes, as he does all his other
<PB N="61" REF="005761_0059_0000000000000000">
<HI>Epistles</HI> to the Churches, with a practical Improvement of the Doc|trines of <HI>Grace,</HI> he had before insisted upon.</P>
<P>The Apostle <HI>Iames</HI> calls on <HI>Christians,</HI> when they pray, to <HI>ask in Faith</HI>: And represents the <HI>Prayer of Faith</HI> as the only <HI>availing</HI> Prayer.&mdash; <HI>Peter</HI> declares Christians <HI>kept by the Power of God thro' Faith unto Salvation;&mdash; coming unto the Lord, as unto a living Stone</HI>; &mdash; and exhorts them <HI>to commit the Keeping of their Souls to Him,</HI> i. e. by renewed Acts of <HI>Faith</HI>; but <HI>to resist the Devil, stedfast in the Faith.</HI> &mdash; The Apostle <HI>Iohn</HI> tells <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>this is the Victory that overcometh the World, even our Faith</HI>: &mdash; And <HI>this is God's Commandment, that we should believe on the Name of his Son Iesus Christ.</HI>&mdash;The Apostle <HI>Iude</HI> exhorts Christians to <HI>be building up themselves on their most holy Faith,</HI> and <HI>looking for the Mercy of our Lord Iesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Were it consistent with my designed Brevity in these Remarks, I might proceed to a more distinct and particular Consideration of all the Epistles to the Churches, through the whole <HI>New-Testament</HI>; and could prove, from every one of them. the direct contrary to what Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> assert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for Truth.&mdash; That this may be brought to a short Issue, I here challenge Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> to instance in <HI>any one</HI> of them (the Epistle of <HI>Iames</HI> not excepted) where the Necessity of a saving <HI>Faith</HI> is not insisted upon, and inculcated in these Epistolary Sermons to professed Christians. If he cannot do this (as I am very certain he cannot) what Truth is there in that Assertion, that they <HI>no longer now insist upon Faith, but Practice</HI>? Or what Foundation for the new Scheme, which he builds upon that imaginary Fact?</P>
<P>Thus I have very briefly shewn, that the Method of Preaching Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> directs us to, is so far from being warranted by the <HI>Ex|amples</HI> of our Blessed SAVIOUR and his <HI>Apostles,</HI> that it is directly contrary to them.&mdash;And having thereby answered the chief Design of these Remarks, I should here conclude, were it not for two or three Things, which seem to demand our particular Notice.</P>
<P>One Thing which especially requires Attention, is expressed in the following Words:
<Q>When we preach to <HI>Christians,</HI> we are not to spend Time in exhorting them to <HI>believe</HI>; for this their very <HI>Pro|fession</HI> supposes they do already: But to press and perswade them to <HI>live</HI> as becomes Christians, to be found in the <HI>Practice</HI> of all <HI>mo|ral Duties.</HI></Q>
(P. 22.)</P>
<P>What <HI>strange Doctrine</HI> is here! &mdash; Does a bare <HI>Profession</HI> of Christianity <HI>suppose</HI> a Man to be a true <HI>Believer</HI> in Christ? It must then follow, that every Professor of Christianity is actually in a jus|tified State, reconciled to God, and at Peace with him. For <HI>the Righ|teousness of God by Faith of Iesus Christ, is unto all, and upon all them
<PB N="62" REF="005761_0060_0000000000000000">
that believe; for there is no Difference.</HI> Rom. iii.22.&mdash; It will also follow, that these are all of them also <HI>sanctified.</HI> For <HI>Faith pu|rifies the Heart</HI> (Acts xv.9) <HI>works by Love</HI> (Gal. v.6.) and <HI>overcometh the World</HI> (1 Joh. v.4, 5.) It will likewise follow, that every <HI>Professor</HI> of Christianity will be an actual Partaker of <HI>eternal Salvation.</HI> For <HI>whosoever believeth in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting Life.</HI> Joh. iii.16. &mdash; <HI>He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved.</HI> Mark xvi.16. &mdash; And is this the Method of Preaching, which Mr. <HI>Caner</HI> recom|mends? Are the Ministers of the Gospel to do, as this Gentleman says <HI>he</HI> does, <HI>take it for granted, that such a one</HI> (a baptized Profes|sor) <HI>has Faith, till we hear he renounces it again?</HI> (P. 25.) Are we to declare in the Name of the Lord, that the most secure and sen|sual of our <HI>baptized</HI> Hearers, are justified before God, are sanctified, and Heirs of eternal Glory?&mdash; Certainly the Case of that People is greatly to be pitied and lamented, who sit under such a Ministry, even as <HI>Sheep without a Shepherd.</HI></P>
<P>Another Thing worthy of particular Notice, is Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>'s Asser|tion, that
<Q>a strong and lively <HI>Faith,</HI> is so <HI>frequently</HI> attended with the Fruits of a good and holy Life, all moral Duties and Virtue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, do so <HI>generally,</HI> and <HI>as it were</HI> naturally, accompany and flow from it, that it is sometimes made Use of in the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> in a very comprehensive Sense, to signify both the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of a Christian.</Q>
&mdash; On which my Remark is, that I know very well a <HI>strong</HI> and <HI>lively Faith</HI> is not only <HI>frequently,</HI> but <HI>always</HI> attended with the Fruits of a good and holy Life; and that all <HI>moral</HI> Dutie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> do not only <HI>generally,</HI> but <HI>evermore,</HI> nor only <HI>as it were,</HI> but properly speaking, <HI>naturally</HI> accompany or flow from it.&mdash; But then this is so far from rendering it a Propriety, to consider that Grace as signifying <HI>both the Faith and Practice of a Christian,</HI> that for this very Reason it cannot with any Propriety be consider'd in such a <HI>comprehensive</HI> Sense; unless the Cause and Effect, the Tree and its Fruits, may be properly consider'd as the same Thing.&mdash; And the <HI>Scripture</HI> is so far from considering it in this View, that in the Affair of our <HI>Iustification</HI> FAITH and WORKS are frequently put in direct <HI>Opposition.</HI> Thus, Rom. iv.5. <HI>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him who justifieth the Ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteousness.</HI>&mdash; Whereas on the contrary, there cannot be so much as <HI>one</HI> Text found in the whole Bible, to verify this Gentleman's Assertion.&mdash; He indeed does in his Margin cite three Texts, in Confirmation of this Imagi|nation; and he might with as much Pertinence, have cited three Thousand.&mdash; The first Text he undertakes to prove this by, is Rom. iii.28. <HI>Therefore we conclude, that a Man is justified by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law.</HI> Very well! A Man is <HI>justified</HI> by <HI>Faith,</HI> without the <HI>Deeds of the Law</HI>; therefore <HI>Faith</HI> is the <HI>Deeds of the Law.</HI> It seems, if (in the Affair of our <HI>Iustification) Faith</HI> be <HI>without</HI> the Deeds of the <HI>Law,</HI> it must be <HI>with</HI> the Deeds of the <HI>Law.</HI> Nay! it must contain the Deeds of the <HI>Law,</HI> in its very Na|ture.
<PB N="63" REF="005761_0061_0000000000000000">
&mdash; Another Text cited to this Purpose, is Gal. v.6. <HI>Faith worketh by Love.</HI> Well! what follows? If <HI>Faith</HI> worketh by <HI>Love,</HI> must <HI>Faith</HI> therefore be, in its Nature, <HI>Love,</HI> and be <HI>all moral Duties and Virtues</HI> besides? If <HI>Solomon</HI> workt (in building the <HI>Temple) by</HI> his Subjects, does it follow, that <HI>Solomon</HI> therefore and his Subjects were one and the same? If the glorious GOD works <HI>by</HI> second Causes, is he therefore the second Causes themselves?&mdash; If <HI>Faith</HI> worketh <HI>by Love,</HI> it proves indeed, that it is productive of <HI>Love</HI>: but it also equally proves, that <HI>Eaith</HI> cannot be the same Thing with that <HI>Affection</HI> which it produces.&mdash; A third Text cited by him, is <HI>Iames</HI> ii.22. <HI>Seest thou how Faith wrought with his Works; and by Works was Faith made perfect?</HI> Well! If <HI>Faith</HI> wrought <HI>with his Works,</HI> it must needs be distinct from his <HI>Works.</HI> For there can be no Propriety, in supposing any Thing to <HI>work</HI> in Concomitancy with it self. <HI>Faith</HI>'s being <HI>made perfect by Works,</HI> can imply no more, than that it was thereby manifested and proved to be <HI>perfect,</HI> i. e. a true, upright, and sincere <HI>Faith</HI>: and not, that <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> are the same Thing. For how inconsistent would all the Apostle's Reasoning in this Chap|ter, about the respective Characters and Properties of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Works,</HI> appear, if he had consider'd them both as one and the same moral Pefection or Excellency?</P>
<P>A third Thing worthy of particular Notice, is Mr. <HI>Caner</HI>'s Repre|sentation of his <HI>Aim</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> in this Discourse.
<Q>What I aim at (says he) is to show the <HI>Weakness</HI> and <HI>Absurdity</HI> of calling upon <HI>Christians</HI> to come to Christ, by a naked, barren, and ineffectual <HI>Faith</HI>; as if that would save them, without a serious Endeavour to <HI>obey</HI> his Commands.</Q>
(Page 25.)&mdash; But who does he find chargeable with this <HI>Weakness</HI> and <HI>Absurdity</HI>? &mdash; Has it not been the constant Profession of these Churches, and the constant Doctrine of their Ministers, that a true <HI>Faith</HI> is such a Receiving the Lord <HI>Ie|sus Christ,</HI> as unites the Soul to him, and both inclines and enables the Believer, through Grace and Strength derived from Christ's Ful|ness, to <HI>serve God in Righteousness and Holiness, all the Days of his Life?</HI>&mdash;And has it not been our constant Doctrine, that <HI>Holiness</HI> is the necessary Fruit and Evidence of a true <HI>Faith</HI>: and that no Man is to be reputed a <HI>Believer,</HI> who is grosly wanting in it?&mdash;We don't, with this Author, consider <HI>Faith</HI> as a <HI>naked doctrinal Assent</HI> to the Truth of the Gospel; but as also a hearty <HI>Consent</HI> to the Gospel-Offer, a cordial <HI>embracing the Promises,</HI> and a trusting in CHRIST both for <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Life.</HI> &mdash; And he that lives in the Exercise of this <HI>unfeigned Faith,</HI> finds it true, by happy Experience, that Christ does not leave him to be ashamed of his Confidence and Hope in him. He does find, by happy Experience, that <HI>Christ Iesus is to him,</HI> not only <HI>Wisdom and Righteousness,</HI> but <HI>Sanctification and Redemp|tion</HI> also.&mdash; From whence it follows, that as an <HI>unholy</HI> Life is ut|terly incompatible with the State and Character of a true <HI>Believer,</HI> so all <HI>Shews</HI> of Holiness, <HI>without</HI> Faith in Christ, are but Streams with|out
<PB N="64" REF="005761_0062_0000000000000000">
a Fountain, that will soon dry up, and leave the poor Soul to fa|mish &amp; perish for ever. <HI>He that believeth in Christ, out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of living Water.</HI> Of what Necessity is it therefore, that this important Subject should be insisted upon by the Ministers of the Gospel, in their publick Sermons, and private Converse, as absolute|ly necessary, not only to the Beginning, but to the continued Progress of the divine Life in the Soul; since <HI>the Righteousness of God is re|vealed from Faith to Faith</HI>; and <HI>the Iust shall live by his Faith!</HI>&mdash; Ministers are to pray for <HI>Christians,</HI> that God would <HI>fulfil in them the Work of Faith with Power</HI>; and to exhort Christians, that they <HI>con|tinue in the Faith</HI>; that they <HI>abound therein</HI>; and <HI>whatsoever they do in Word or Deed,</HI> that they <HI>do all in the Name of the Lord Iesus Christ</HI>; that they <HI>come unto God by Him,</HI> in all their religious Duties and moral Obedience; eyeing Christ as the only <HI>Medium</HI> of their Hope in God, Access to Him, and Communion with Him; being in the daily Exercise of a humble Trust in Christ, for <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI>; and <HI>looking for the Mercy of the Lord Iesus Christ, unto eternal Life.</HI> &mdash; May we be found so doing!</P>

<HEAD>A VINDICATION Of GOD's <HI>sovereign free Grace,</HI> in some brief REFLECTIONS on an ano|nymous Pamphlet, intitled, A LET|TER from <HI>Aristocles</HI> to <HI>Authades.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT this <HI>Letter,</HI> written by Dr. JOHNSON, had its Rise from a printed <HI>Sermon</HI> of Mr. COOKE'S (of <HI>Stratfield</HI>) upon <HI>Exod.</HI> xxxiii.19. seems necessary to be taken Notice of, on Account of some Occasion I shall have for comparing the <HI>Letter</HI> with the <HI>Sermon,</HI> against which it is level'd.</P>
<P>This being premised, I shall immediately proceed to consider the State of the <HI>Question</HI> in Debate.&mdash; This the <HI>Dr.</HI> proposes in the fol|lowing Words.
<Q>You may remember, it was your chief Inquiry, as a Test of my being a true Christian, <HI>Can you in Sincerity subscribe to the Truth of our Doctrine?</HI> By which you meant the Doctrine of the divine <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> as you had explain'd it, <HI>i. e.</HI> (if I un|derstand you right) as implying God's <HI>eternal, arbitrary,</HI> and <HI>ab|solute Determination of the everlasting Fate of his Creatures,</HI> from his own mere Motion, and without any Consideration of their <HI>good</HI> or <HI>ill</HI> Behaviour.</Q></P>
<P>But what was the Reason, the <HI>Dr.</HI> could no better understand Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Doctrine? It was plainly and intelligibly expressed, in the following Words:&mdash;<HI>The Mercy of God to any of his</HI> SINFUL <HI>Creatures, hath its Foundation in, and taketh its Rise from, his mere sovereign ar|bitrary good Pleasure.</HI>&mdash;Is there not a very wide Difference, between these two Representations of the <HI>Objects</HI> of God's <HI>Sovereignty?</HI> Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI> in his <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and in the whole Prosecution of it, considers the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God with Relation to his <HI>sinful, fallen</HI> Creatures. The <HI>Dr.</HI> considers it with Relation to God's Creatures, <HI>as such,</HI> and no where takes Notice of its respecting us as in an <HI>apostate, sinful</HI> State.&mdash; If he thought this to be the best Method to make a plausible Appearance against the Doctrine he saw fit to oppose, he should however have remembered, that it was not the best Method to re+commend his own Justice and Candor to the World; nor to discover
<PB N="66" REF="005761_0064_0000000000000000">
the Truth in the Point debated.&mdash; They must have a very dark and unjust Apprehension of the Subject under Consideration, who don't al|low, that the <HI>Objects</HI> of God's eternal Counsels of <HI>Grace,</HI> as well as of both the Impetration and Application of saving Mercy, were the <HI>apostate, guilty, polluted</HI> Children of Men.&mdash; Hence it appears, that the <HI>Question</HI> before us should be thus stated,</P>
<P><HI>Whether all God's Designs of Mercy, and all the actual Exercises of his saving Grace, to any of the</HI> apostate, sinful, guilty <HI>Race of Mankind, don't flow merely from his</HI> sovereign good Will <HI>and</HI> Pleasure; <HI>and from no other Motive whatsoever?</HI></P>
<P>This, held in the Affirmative, was what Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Text directly led him to treat of: this, so held, is a just Representation of the Scope of his Sermon: This therefore should have been the Subject of Dr. <HI>Iohnson</HI>'s Letter, when he was pleased to write in Opposition to Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Sermon: and consequently this is the proper Subject of the present Inquiry.</P>
<P>I must, however, consider his Reasoning as it is proposed (whether pertinent or not) and see whether he can disprove the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God, in the Donation of his special saving Mercy.</P>
<P>He first argues,
<Q>That it is contrary to the Nature and Attributes of God; because it appears plainly inconsistent with his being a moral Governor of the World. For it represents him as laying his Creatures under a <HI>Necessity</HI> of being what they are, whether good or bad; and so leaves no Room for either Virtue or Vice, Praise or Blame, Reward or Punishment, properly speaking.&mdash; Nay, it implies a <HI>form'd Design</HI> of laying far by the greatest Number of his Creatures under a <HI>Necessity</HI> of being eternally miserable, <HI>antecedent</HI> to any Consideration of their <HI>Demerit.</HI>&mdash;It imports a manifest <HI>double Dealing</HI> with them.</Q>
(Page 2.)</P>
<P>In Answer to this, I should first inquire, How the Dr. will accord|ing to this Method of Reasoning, vindicate God's Attributes and mo|ral Government, with Respect to his most open, known, and constant Dispensations of Providence, towards the World of Mankind?&mdash; It is a visible, undisputed Fact, that the <HI>greatest Part of the World</HI> are left by the Providence of God, in a State of Ignorance, Impiety, and abominable Idolatry; to live and die in the Denial of God our Maker, and of God our Saviour, and in the Worship and Service of their dumb Idols and vile Pagods: while the same <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> which has left them utterly ignorant of the Way of Salvation, has opened the Door of Salvation to others, no better than they.&mdash; Now what Reason can possibly be assigned, why God may not (consistent with his moral Perfections) hold the same Method with <HI>Individuals,</HI> as we see in Fact he does with collective Bodies and Nations of Men?&mdash;What Reason can possibly be assign'd, why God has not a Right to act with the same <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> in the Donation of saving Grace, as in the Dis|tribution of those Favours and Privileges, upon which eternal Salva|tion is so dependant?&mdash; Let it be brought to the Trial. Let the <HI>Dr.</HI> undertake to vindicate the Attributes and moral Government of
<PB N="67" REF="005761_0065_0000000000000000" MS="y">
God, in this Act of his <HI>Sovereignty</HI> I have now specified, by any Ar|guments he can devise; and it will then be seen, whether the same Arguments won't as fully vindicate the divine Attributes against all Imputation, in the other Case also.&mdash;This therefore shews the Weak|ness of this Argument: for if it proves any Thing, it proves a great deal too much.&mdash; It is certain in Fact, that God does act in Ways of arbitrary <HI>Sovereignty</HI> in the Affairs of Men's eternal Salvation: And therefore, it is also certain, that he acts agreeable to his glorious At|tributes, and worthy of the moral Governour of the World; whether our shallow Intellects can fathom the unsearchable Depths of his Dis|pensations, or not.&mdash; But perhaps the <HI>Dr.</HI> will tell me, that this only cuts the Knot, and does not untie it. I shall therefore next consider, whether there be any Force at all in his Reasonings, with Respect to any Representation of God's <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> either in Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Sermon, or any other of our <HI>Calvinist</HI> Divines.</P>
<P>Is it not an unquestionable Truth, that God <HI>owed no Mercy</HI> at all to any of his fallen Creatures? And therefore, that he might with|out any Injustice have left us all, with the <HI>Angels</HI> that fell, <HI>in Chains of Darkness, reserv'd unto the Iudgment of the great Day?</HI> For <HI>we have all sinned, and come short of the Glory of God. Both</HI> Jews <HI>and</HI> Gentiles <HI>are all under Sin; and the whole World become guilty before God.</HI>&mdash; What Impeachment then of God's moral Government can there be, on the Account of his eternally purposing, and actually in <HI>Time</HI> bestowing that special <HI>Grace</HI> upon some, which none have deser|ved, and which none can claim? Shall we murmur and complain, because God does not bestow his Salvation upon <HI>all</HI>; when we should have had no just Cause to complain, if he had bestow'd it upon none of the apostate Race of <HI>Adom?</HI></P>
<P>But
"<HI>this lays his Creatures under a</HI> Necessity <HI>of being what they are, whether good or bad.</HI>"
&mdash; What does the <HI>Dr.</HI> mean by <HI>Necessity?</HI> If he means, that the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God's Grace, consider'd either in his <HI>Decrees,</HI> or in the <HI>Execution</HI> of them, has any <HI>necessitating Agency</HI> upon Men, so as to compel or force them to be <HI>good,</HI> or <HI>bad,</HI> he knows that this is what the <HI>Calvinists</HI>&punc; have always disclaim'd: And it is certain, that it is no natural Consequence from the Doctrine of God's <HI>Sove|reignty.</HI>&mdash; The <HI>Decrees</HI> of God can have no such active Influence, while they remain Counsels secret and unknown to us; and therefore without any direct Agency upon our Minds, or impulsive Constraint upon any Part of our Conduct. God has never <HI>chosen</HI> any Man to <HI>Salvation,</HI> but through <HI>Sanctification of the Spirit,</HI> producing a free and voluntary Acceptance of Christ, and a chosen Life of Holiness and Conformity to God. <HI>God has from the Beginning chosen us to Salvation, through Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth.</HI> 2 Thess. ii.13. The <HI>Sovereign</HI> Counsels of God's Grace do therefore make it evident, that no Man can be constrain'd, either to Holiness, or Hap|pines: but both must be his own free Choice; or else be ob|tain'd in a Way contrary to the sovereign and immutable Purpose of God's Grace.&mdash;Besides, what is the Decree of God, but God himself
<PB N="68" REF="005761_0066_0000000000000000">
acting in a Way of infinite Counsel and Knowledge? And how does it follow, that we must be put under any <HI>coactive Necessity,</HI> because there is a God of absolute Perfection, infinite in his Knowledge and Counsel? Upon the whole then, there can be no just Pretence to our being brought under any <HI>compulsive Necessity,</HI> from the Decrees of God.&mdash;If this be consider'd with Respect to the sovereign Grace of God, <HI>renewing</HI> and <HI>sanctifying</HI> our Souls, it will also appear, that there is no Place for any Pretence of a <HI>coactive Necessity.</HI> For in this Change, <HI>Christ's People are made willing in the Day of his Power</HI>; are brought into a chosen and delightful Conformity to the Nature and Will of God.&mdash; And as for those, who in God's holy <HI>Sove|reignty</HI> are left to themselves, what <HI>Constraint</HI> are they laid under; while they have their own free Choice, and act according to their own moral Dispositions? Here therefore is no Shadow of any <HI>coactive Necessity.</HI></P>
<P>In whatever Light this Case is viewed, there can be no Appearance of any other, than a <HI>consequential Necessity,</HI> flowing from the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God's Grace. That is, there's only a <HI>Certainty,</HI> that eternal Salvation will be the Consequence of our Participation of God's <HI>sovereign Grace</HI>; and on the contrary, that they will certainly perish, who are not the Subjects of God's <HI>sovereign Grace.</HI>&mdash; This <HI>Necessity,</HI> if the <HI>Certainty</HI> of a future Event may be called <HI>Necessity,</HI> I readily allow; not only i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the present Case, but with Respect also to every Event of every Kind, that ever has happen'd, or ever will happen in the World. &mdash; But then, this is so far from being inconsistent with the divine Attri|butes, that it is a rational and necessary Deduction from them. If there be an <HI>omniscient GOD,</HI> he certainly had, from Eternity, all Things in his View at once: And it is equally certain, both that this <HI>Omni|science</HI> was agreeable to his <HI>Will,</HI> and all other Perfections of his glo|rious <HI>Nature,</HI> without the least Repugnancy among the divine Attri|butes; and also, that every <HI>Futurity</HI> will eventually be according as GOD has from Eternity <HI>known</HI> that it would be, unless we blasphe|mously suppose a Defect of Knowledge in the glorious God. &mdash; From this View of the Case, I think, it manifestly appears, that the <HI>Dr</HI>'s Argument from <HI>Necessity</HI> is really trifling, and has nothing in't. &mdash; God has by his <HI>Sovereignty</HI> put no Man under a compulsive <HI>Neces|sity,</HI> to be either holy or wicked: But all are, notwithstanding, in such a State of perfect Freedom, as to be capable of acting their own voluntary Inclinations. And though all Events will come to pass ac|cording to God's eternal Counsel and Knowledge, this no Way in|fringes the <HI>Liberty</HI> of the Creature: nor can any Pretences of this Kind be justly made, unless it be supposed, that there cannot be an <HI>omniscient GOD,</HI> and a <HI>Creature,</HI> notwithstanding, in a State of <HI>Liberty.</HI> Here then, it mayn't be improper, to put the <HI>Dr.</HI> in Mind of his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nswer to this pretended Difficulty. His Words are,
<Q>The CER|TAINTY, <HI>before</HI> it is, that any Thing <HI>will</HI> be, can no more infer the NECESSITY of it. than the <HI>Certainty, when</HI> it is, implies its being <HI>a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssary</HI> Event.</Q>
&mdash; Well then, what becomes of his Argument
<PB N="69" REF="005761_0067_0000000000000000">
from <HI>Necessity?</HI> What becomes of the frightful Consequences he would draw from this imaginary <HI>Necessity</HI>; when such a <HI>Necessity</HI> as he supposes, has no Existence, but in his own Imagination; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or can any Way be deduced from the Doctrine he opposes?&mdash; Does he then treat the dreadful MAJESTY of Heaven and Earth with a Reverence becoming his holy Profession and Character, when he speaks of GOD'S having <HI>a formed Design of laying by far the greatest Number of his Creatures under a</HI> NECESSITY <HI>of being eternally</HI> MISERABLE; <HI>of</HI> his being acted by <HI>a most</HI> SELFISH <HI>View to his own Glory</HI>; and of his using <HI>manifest</HI> DOUBLE DEALING; and the like?</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Iohnson</HI> proceeds to argue, that
<Q>this Doctrine appears to be evidently contrary to a great many plain Texts of holy Scripture, which assure us in the clearest and strongest Terms, that <HI>God is not willing, that any should perish; but that all should come to Repentance.</HI> That <HI>he would have all Men to be saved</HI>; and that for this End <HI>he sent his Son into the World, who tasted Death for every Man</HI>; and <HI>became a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World</HI>; and <HI>gave himself a Ransom for all</HI>; nay, even for those that <HI>by denying the Lord that bought them, bring upon themselves swift Destruction.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I would here inquire of Dr. <HI>Iohnson,</HI> Whether he understands by these, or any other such Texts of Scripture, that God has a <HI>Purpose</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> actually to save <HI>all</HI> Mankind without Exception, or not? &mdash; A fair Answer to this will obviate the Difficulty. If he answers in the <HI>Affirmative,</HI> how then is it true, that <HI>God's Counsel shall stand, and he will do all his Pleasure?</HI> (Isa. xlvi.10.) That <HI>the Counsel of the Lord standeth for ever; and the Thoughts of his Heart to all Generations?</HI> (Psal. xxxiii.11.)&mdash; If he answers in the <HI>Negative,</HI> why can't it be true, that God wills the Salvation of all Men upon the Terms of the Gospel; though he in <HI>Sovereignty</HI> bestows special Grace upon a select Number only? I think, the <HI>Dr.</HI> will hardly suppose, that God will save any, who do <HI>not</HI> comply with the Terms of the Gospel: and the Doctrine before us will exclude none, that <HI>do</HI> comply with the Gospel-Terms. He will hardly suppose, that God will save any Men <HI>against</HI> their Wills: And the Doctrine before us will exclude none who are <HI>willing</HI> that He should save them.&mdash; Where then is the Dif|ficulty? Why is not the <HI>Dr</HI>'s own Scheme as contrary to the cited Scriptures, as ours?&mdash;God indeed, in a Way of <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> gives <HI>special Grace</HI> to some, and not to others. But he gives <HI>common Grace</HI> to all the gospelized World; which is as much as this Gentleman seems to suppose given to any at all. He freely offers Salvation to all: he prohibits or hinders none from a Compliance with the graci|ous Offer. If any perish from under the Gospel, it is merely on Ac|count of their Rejection of a most condescending Treaty of Grace and Life.&mdash; These are Truths confessed on both Sides of the Ques|tion; and Truths as consistent with the cited Texts of Scripture, upon the <HI>Calvinistical,</HI> as upon the <HI>Arminian</HI> Principles. God's bestowing
<PB N="70" REF="005761_0068_0000000000000000">
<HI>special Grace</HI> upon some, is no Hindrance to others, from improving of that <HI>common Grace,</HI> whereof they are all Joint-Partakers.</P>
<P>Let these Gentlemen therefore, on the other Side of the Question, bring the Matter to a fair Trial, and it will appear, that their own Sentiments are every Way, and in the same Manner, as repugnant to the quoted Scriptures, as they can pretend ours to be. If we <HI>contradict</HI> these Scriptures, <HI>they</HI> do so too; or if their Sentiments are <HI>concurrent</HI> with these Scriptures, <HI>ours</HI> are equally so also; there is no Difference in this Respect.&mdash;Are they bold enough to argue, with Dr. <HI>Iohnson,</HI> (p. 2.) that <HI>it imports manifest double-Dealing, or a secret Will inconsis|tent with what God has clearly revealed,</HI> to suppose that God has in <HI>Sovereignty</HI> designed <HI>special Grace</HI> to some, and not to others, when he declares himself <HI>willing, that all should be saved?</HI> Won't the same Consequence appear, with equal Force, from the Supposal (which they themselves must necessarily allow) that God has <HI>not</HI> willed and designed the <HI>actual</HI> Salvation of each individual Person, notwithstanding he has declared himself <HI>willing, that all should be sa|ved?</HI> Is there not as much Appearance of a <HI>secret</HI> and <HI>revealed Will</HI> in this Case, as in the other?&mdash;Will they argue, as both Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> and the <HI>Dr.</HI> do, that he who wills the <HI>End,</HI> must will the <HI>Means</HI>? It is allow'd by the <HI>Calvinists,</HI> that God does will the common Means of Salvation to all who live under the Gospel; and our Opponents them|selves cannot pretend, that he wills <HI>effectual</HI> Means to all Men: For then all without Difference would actually be saved. There can be therefore no Difficulty in this Case, when the <HI>Calvinists</HI> unitedly allow, that God does will the same general Means for the Salvation of all the gospelized World, as the <HI>Arminians</HI> themselves suppose he does: And it is nothing inconsistent with this, to suppose, that of his <HI>sovereign</HI> Grace He also wills special efficacious Means to some, by which they are actually saved.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, for ought I see, there can stand no <HI>Ob|jection</HI> against the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God in the Donation of his special Grace, but this only, <HI>Our Eye is evil, because God is good.</HI> He acts as one that has a Right to <HI>do what he will with his own.</HI> He deals with all better than they deserve, better than they can claim at his Hands: And yet bestows special distinguishing Mercy upon some, to which he has no Motive, but his <HI>sovereign</HI> Pleasure.&mdash; To conclude this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Words of Another;
"God would <HI>have all Men come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nowledge of the Truth, and be saved</HI>: That is, he obligeth Ministers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> preach to them, and others to pray for them and help them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> themselves to obey, and receive his Grace; and he giveth them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and giveth Christ and Life by free Donation to all, so they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>accept the Gift.</HI> And he that strictly <HI>willeth</HI> thus much, may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, after the Manner of Men, to <HI>will</HI> the <HI>Event.</HI> And this is <HI>all</HI> (says he) that <HI>both Sides</HI> mean, if they understood themselves."</P>
<P>Another Argument Dr. <HI>Iohnson</HI> has produced to this Purpose, is, that
<Q>It seems manifestly repugnant to the general <HI>Drift</HI> of the whole <HI>Word</HI> of God (which is plainly to excite our utmost Activity
<PB N="71" REF="005761_0069_0000000000000000">
in the Pursuit of Holiness of Heart and Life) there being Nothing that can so effectually tend, not only to tempt us to entertain hard and unworthy Thoughts of God, but also to cut the Sinews of all our Endeavours to repent and return to him and our Duty, as the most distant Surmize, that possibly all our Labour may be in vain; since, for ought we know, we may be absolutely excluded from all Possibility of succeeding, by a <HI>sovereign</HI> and <HI>inexorable Decree of Reprobation.</HI></Q>
(P. 3.)</P>
<P>Not to insist upon the Impertinency of this Argument to the Subject the <HI>Dr.</HI> undertakes to treat upon, and his leaving the Doctrine of God's <HI>sovereign Grace,</HI> to harangue upon the Decree of <HI>Reprobation</HI>; which, by his Leave, is quite foreign to the Purpose: for God may be <HI>sovereign</HI> in the Bestowment of his special Grace, whether there be, or be not an absolute, or (as he words it) an <HI>inexorable Decree of Reprobation.</HI> It is <HI>sovereign</HI> Grace, if God has <HI>chosen</HI> some, in such a Manner as he has not chosen others, to be the special Heirs of Salvation; whether there be an actual, positive Predetermination of any Man's final <HI>Perdition,</HI> or not.&mdash; But passing this, as foreign to the present Debate, I would inquire, <HI>Who</HI> ever taught, <HI>Who</HI> ever supposed, such <HI>an inexorable De|cree of Reprobation,</HI> as would make <HI>all our Endeavours to repent and to return to God and our Duty, and all our Labours, to be in vain?</HI> Don't every Body allow, that the Means and the End are connected toge|ther, both in the Nature of Things, and in the divine Decree; so that to expect the latter without the former, is but a groundless Pre|sumption?&mdash; And don't all allow, that <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Holiness</HI> are our Evidence, that we were <HI>chosen in Christ from the Foundation of the World</HI>? &mdash; The more diligent therefore we are in the Way of God and Godliness, the more Evidence we have, not only that there can be no <HI>Decree against</HI> us, but also that we are the Subjects of God's <HI>Electing</HI> Love.&mdash;<HI>Holiness</HI> begun here, and perfected in Glory, belongs to the Essence of that <HI>Salvation,</HI> to which the <HI>Elect</HI> are predestinated. To speak therefore of an <HI>inexorable Decree of Reprobation,</HI> against those who are sincerely pursuing a Life of <HI>Holiness,</HI> is a most glaring Con|tradiction.</P>
<P>I might further observe, that the Doctrine of God's <HI>Sovereignty</HI> is so far from <HI>cutting the Sinews of our Endeavours to repent and return to God,</HI> that it is the most powerful Incentive to it.&mdash;What Argu|ment can more powerfully animate us to <HI>give Diligence,</HI> than the Consideration, that this is the Means. <HI>to make our Calling and Election sure,</HI> and that <HI>if we</HI> verily <HI>do these Things, we shall never fall?</HI> 2 Pet. i.10.&mdash; Is God <HI>sovereign</HI> in the Gift of his special Grace? What Cause have we then to <HI>lie at his Foot,</HI> with humble and earnest Ap|plication for unmerited Mercy! This is the Method which poor starv|ing <HI>Beggars</HI> use at the Doors of the Rich, or such as are able to relieve them: This is the Method which condemned <HI>Male|factors</HI> use, in seeking a Pardon or a Reprieve, from their offend|ed Sovereign? And this is the Method which the Apostle exhorts us to use in the present Case. <HI>Work out your own Salvation</HI> (says he)
<PB N="72" REF="005761_0070_0000000000000000">
<HI>with Fear and Trembling: For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good Pleasure.</HI> Phil. ii.12, 13.&mdash; Is God <HI>sove|reign, having Mercy upon whom he will have Mercy,</HI> what vast Encou|ragement is this to the greatest of Sinners, to <HI>flee for Refuge, to lay Hold on the Hope set before them</HI>; since they are to hope for MERCY, for GOD'S Sake, and for his SON'S Sake, and not for <HI>their own</HI>; not on Account of any personal Qualifications intitling them to special Grace; and since therefore, they have as good a Plea for Acceptance and Favour with God, as any unrenewed Sinner in the World ever had; and no Grounds of Discouragement or Despondency on Account of their Guilt or Impotence?&mdash; I may add to this, that the Doc|trine of God's <HI>Sovereignty</HI> has a direct Tendency to make the Sinner low and vile in his own Eyes; to bring him to have a sutable De|pendance upon the mere <HI>Mercy</HI> of God in Christ, and to offer <HI>the Sa|crifices of God,</HI> a <HI>broken Heart,</HI> and a <HI>contrite Spirit,</HI> which <HI>He will not despise.</HI>&mdash;I might subjoin, that there is nothing has a greater Ten|dency to put Men upon an active Improvement of the <HI>present Season</HI> of Grace, than the Doctrine of God's <HI>Sovereignty.</HI> This teaches them of what Concernment it is, <HI>in the Morning to sow their Seed, and in the Evening not to withhold their Hand,</HI> since <HI>they don't know which will prosper, whether this or that.</HI> This teaches them the dreadful Danger of neglecting the <HI>Day of their Visitation</HI>; lest they provoke God to hide the <HI>Things of their Peace</HI> from their Eyes, to withhold the Influences of his blessed Spirit, and to give them up to a <HI>hard Heart and a reprobate Mind.</HI>&mdash; These are not vain and airy Speculations: but we see by Experience, that when this Doctrine of God's <HI>Sovereign|ty</HI> is heartily received, and rightly understood, it commonly has a good Influence upon Men's <HI>Conduct</HI>; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is indisputably evident, that they are (in general) more regular in their <HI>Lives,</HI> and more seriously concern'd about their <HI>Souls,</HI> who realise the Truth of this Doctrine, and cordially embrace it, than those of the opposite Per|swasion. I speak it not out of Envy, but <HI>to the Praise of the Glory of divine Grace.</HI></P>
<P>But then on the contrary, they who suppose (on the one Hand) that they have a <HI>natural Power,</HI> or Ability by the Help of meer <HI>com|mon Grace,</HI> to believe and repent, without the <HI>special</HI> Influences of the Spirit; and (on the other Hand) that God is ready to forgive and receive them upon <HI>such</HI> Repentance and Return to him, as is thus within their own Power, commonly give into <HI>Delay</HI> for the present, in Expectation of some future Opportunity of returning to God, and se|curing the Salvation of their Souls: And this seems to be the com|mon Cause of that Security, which so prevails, even in the pro|fessing World.</P>
<P>What I suppose Dr. <HI>Iohnson</HI> designs for another Argument, against the Doctrine of the divine <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> as represented in the <HI>Sermon</HI> he writes against, is this.&mdash; He
<Q>cannot think it consistent with the divine Attributes, God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Wisdom, Holiness, Justice, Goodness <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to give <HI>Being</HI> to any of his intelligent Creatures, without put|ting

them into a <HI>Condition</HI> that every Thing being considered, in the whole of their Nature and Duration, would render Being <HI>desir|able</HI> to them; nor to put them eternally into a Condition that is <HI>worse</HI> than <HI>not to be,</HI> but for <HI>their own personal Fault,</HI> or voluntary Misconduct in Opposition to his Will.</Q>
(P. 6, 7.)</P>
<P>The <HI>Dr.</HI> must suffer me to tell him, that I think this Argument al|together impertinent,&mdash; For,</P>

Did not God, when he gave <HI>Being</HI> to Man at <HI>first,</HI> put him into a <HI>State,</HI> that was much <HI>better</HI> than not to be; and a State of Happi|ness, that would have continued to his <HI>Posterity,</HI> as well as to himself, during <HI>the whole of their Nature and Duration,</HI> had it not been for <HI>Man's own Fault, and voluntary Misconduct in Opposition to the Will of God?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Has not the glorious God, at an infinite Expence, provided a Way of <HI>Recovery</HI> for apostate Man from their fallen guilty State; and made a free Tender of the glorious Salvation to all, under the Go|spel, and actually excluding none who don't wilfully reject it, and so by their <HI>personal Fault, and voluntary Misconduct in Opposition to his Will,</HI> cut themselves off from the <HI>unspeakable Gift.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God's Grace is no <HI>Hindrance</HI> to any Man liv|ing, from a Compliance with the gracious Terms of Salvation by Jesus Christ. Every one who is truly willing to embrace the Gospel-Promise, will be Partaker of the Benefit: And if they are <HI>not</HI> willing to accept such an infinite Good, <HI>whose Fault</HI> is it?&mdash; The <HI>special</HI> Favour shewn to some, is no Bar in the Way of others. There is no Impediment in the Way of their everlasting Happiness, but an Attachment to their Lusts and Idols, and the Prevalence of an <HI>evil Heart of Unbelief</HI>; they <HI>will not come to Christ, that they might have Life.</HI>&mdash; God's (unknown) Counsel and Purpose of special Grace to some, can have no proper Influence, but to animate all to a Care, that they may secure and evidence their own Interest in his special Fa|vour.&mdash; The Obstructions of Mercy are not on God's Part, but on Man's altogether.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is certain, that none of the divine <HI>Attributes</HI> do lay the glori|ous God under <HI>Obligation,</HI> to restore every or any fallen Creature to his primitive Integrity.&mdash; This we are assured of, by his Conduct towards the fallen <HI>Angels</HI>; as well as by the Pravity and Corruption of human Nature, found in the whole Race of <HI>Adam,</HI> and which final|ly continues in a great Part of them.&mdash;Whether Dr. <HI>Iohnson</HI> can see through the Equity of God's Dispensations, or not, these are cer|tain Facts, which can't be disputed; and therefore cannot be contrary to the Perfections of the divine Nature. For, <HI>shall not the Iudge of all the Earth do right!</HI>&mdash; To conclude this Head, it is most certain, that God has made the brightest Displays of his <HI>Goodness</HI> towards the human Race, both in the first and second Covenant; and whoever of them fail of a Happiness worthy of their Being, are <HI>personally in Fault,</HI> for the Enmity of their Nature to God, and for the Sinfulness of their Hearts and Lives; and are therefore justly punish'd by their Judge.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="005761_0072_0000000000000000">Thus I have very briefly consider'd the <HI>Dr's</HI> several Arguments a|gainst the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God's Grace, as represented in Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Sermon.&mdash;</P>
<P>I shall next proceed to take Notice of some few of the many <HI>excep|tionable</HI> Things, which incidently occur in his Letter to Mr. <HI>Cooke.</HI></P>
<P>I might first have taken Notice of his pretending to quote some Passages out of Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Sermon, and to take Occasion thence of a most pathetick Complaint of <HI>Censoriousness</HI> and <HI>Uncharitableness</HI>: But this not being to the Merits of the Cause, there needs no more to be said upon it, but to desire the Reader to compare the 19, 33 and 34 Pages of Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Sermon, with the <HI>Dr</HI>'s Quotation; and see with his own Eyes the very great <HI>Misrepresentation</HI> of Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Words; and the great Injustice of that Cry of <HI>Uncharitableness,</HI> pre|tended to be deduced from them.</P>
<P>I proceed to take Notice of Dr. <HI>Iohnson</HI>'s Representation of the Doctrine of God's <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> according to <HI>his own</HI> Apprehension of it. He thus writes,
<Q>I agree then, that God is entirely <HI>sovereign</HI> and <HI>arbitrary,</HI> as a <HI>Benefactor,</HI> in the Distribution of his Talents and Favours both spiritual and temporal, as proper Means of Trial and Probation in the World, <HI>i. e.</HI> the various Abilities, Privileges and Advantages he bestoweth upon Mankind.</Q>
(Page 6.)&mdash; Again he allows,
<Q>1. That God is merely <HI>sovereign</HI> and <HI>arbitrary,</HI> in the various Distribution of his <HI>Favours</HI>; and in <HI>chusing</HI> and <HI>rejecting</HI> whom he pleases, with Regard to the Privileges of being his <HI>peculiar People.</HI> 2. That however he was now very just, in rejecting them (the <HI>Iews</HI>) and leaving them to the Hardness of their Hearts, as he did <HI>Pharaoh</HI></Q>
(Page 14.) And again,
<Q>In the Distribution of Talents and Favours in this State of <HI>Probation,</HI> the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God as a <HI>Benefactor,</HI> does truly take Place.</Q>
(P. 20.)</P>
<P>I need not inquire of the <HI>Dr,</HI> whence he derived his Authority to draw a Line of Limitation, to the Exercise of God's <HI>Sovereignty?</HI> Or whence it is, that God has not a Right to dispose, according to his <HI>good Pleasure,</HI> of one Instance of undeserved Favour to poor guilty Sinners, as well as another; since none is deserved, but all forfeited, and all the Product of mere Bounty and Mercy?&mdash; I need not (I say) insist upon this; nor press him to an Answer where none can possibly be given; because I am greatly mistaken, if he does not by this give up the Case, and in Effect allow all that Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI> pleads for, in the <HI>Sermon</HI> which his Letter was design'd against.&mdash; I think, it cannot be denied, that <HI>saving Grace</HI> is one of the Talents and Fa|vours distributed in this State of Probation. If therefore, God be <HI>so|vereign</HI> and <HI>arbitrary</HI> in the <HI>Distribution of his Talents and Favours</HI> in this State of <HI>Probation,</HI> (as he allows) then he is <HI>sovereign</HI> in the Do|nation of <HI>saving Grace,</HI> which was the only Thing asserted and illus|trated by Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>; and the only Thing which Dr. <HI>Iohnson</HI> should have attempted to disprove, in his Remarks upon that Sermon.&mdash;Be|sides, it will also follow, from the <HI>Dr</HI>'s own Concessions, that God is <HI>sovereign</HI> in withholding the necessary Qualifications for future Glory,
<PB N="75" REF="005761_0073_0000000000000000">
in that he allows, God was <HI>sovereign</HI> in leaving the <HI>Iews</HI> in an Estate of <HI>Unbelief</HI>; and therefore in an Estate of inevitable Perdition.&mdash;I think, he can't pretend, that those <HI>Iews</HI> to whom God has so long given a <HI>Spirit of Slumber, Eyes that they should not see, and Ears that they should not hear, unto this Day,</HI> can any of them be the Heirs of <HI>Salvation.</HI> No, <HI>their Eyes are darkened, that they may not see; and that they may how down their Back alway.</HI>&mdash; I may add, that if we consider the other Part of his Concession, it will likewise appear, that <HI>God is sove|reign and arbitrary</HI> also, in bestowing saving Grace upon such of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as are made Partakers of it. For if he has in mere arbitra|ry <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> without any Desert of their own, chosen them in the Place and Stead of the <HI>Iews,</HI> to be Partakers of the <HI>Means</HI> of Salva|tion, has he not in like <HI>Sovereignty</HI> also, chosen them to that <HI>Salvation,</HI> which will be the necessary Consequence of their due Improvement of those Means?&mdash; I think, the <HI>Dr.</HI> won't pretend, that God had no <HI>Design</HI> of Salvation to any of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> by that Act of <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> by which they are brought into the Enjoyment of Gospel-Privileges. And if he had a <HI>Design</HI> of their Salvation, in that Act of <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> he must then allow, that God is (to use his own Words) <HI>merely sove|reign and arbitrary,</HI> with Respect to the eternal Salvation of all such of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as shall be eternally saved.&mdash; Thus then he has fairly given up the Case; and whatever Arguments he brings against Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Doctrine, do equally militate against his own.&mdash; Such Incon|sistency must necessarily be the Consequence of limiting the divine <HI>So|vereignty,</HI> to temporal Favours and present Privileges only.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dr.</HI> observes, that
<Q>It seems to him very necessary to <HI>distin|guish,</HI> between the Consideration of God as a <HI>Benefactor,</HI> and a <HI>Iudge</HI>; and between the Bestowment of various <HI>Talents</HI> and <HI>Favours</HI> upon Men in this Life, which is a State of <HI>Probation</HI>; and the <HI>Retribution</HI> to be awarded in the Life to come, according to what <HI>Use</HI> they shall have made of them here.&mdash; In the one God acts as <HI>sovereign Lord</HI> of his Favours; and in the other as a <HI>righteous Iudge</HI> of the Behaviour of his Creatures under them.</Q>
(P. 6.)</P>
<P>To which I answer, that this is all very true; but then it is difficult conceiving, to what Purpose it is urged; unless to pull down with the one Hand, what is built up with the other, and to express his full Consent to the Doctrine which he opposes.&mdash; Does not God act as a <HI>Benefactor,</HI> in the Donation of his special <HI>Grace</HI> to whom he pleases? Is not special Grace <HI>a Talent and Favour bestowed upon Men in this Life, which is a State of Probation?</HI> Did ever any Body suppose, that Men will be brought to a Trial before their Judge at the great Day, for their having received, or <HI>not received,</HI> special Grace from God? Is it not allowed on all Hands, that <HI>the Retributions to be awarded in the Life to come, will be according to what</HI> Use <HI>Men make of the Talents they are here betrusted with?</HI> Is it any Way inconsistent with this&punc; that God has bestowed upon some, such special and distinguishing Grace and Favour, as he has not bestow'd upon others? &mdash; Is there not then a full Concession before us, that in the Donation of special Grace&punc;
<PB N="76" REF="005761_0074_0000000000000000">
<HI>God acts as sovereign Lord of his Favours</HI>; and gives, or with-holds it, according to his own good Pleasure?&mdash;What then is the <HI>Dr.</HI> writing against?&mdash; Is not this all that Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI> undertook to prove in his Sermon; and all that any Body (in the present Case) asserts or con|tends for?</P>
<P>I shall next consider some Reflections made by Dr. <HI>Iohnson,</HI> upon the divine <HI>Praescience.</HI>&mdash; Not that I propose a Debate with him about the physical Propriety of the Word, <HI>Foreknowledge</HI>; as applied to the infinite and glorious GOD.&mdash; I allow, that <HI>there is neither past nor to come, neither fore nor after in him.</HI> But what I would particularly take Notice of, is the <HI>Consequences</HI> he would draw from that Subject:
<Q>For as it cannot be <HI>(says he)</HI> but that God's <HI>Knowledge</HI> must be absolutely perfect, he must therefore <HI>foresee,</HI> or rather <HI>see</HI> every Thing certainly <HI>as being what it is</HI>; necessary Events, as being ne|cessary; and contingent, as being such; and the Actions of such as he has made free Agents, as being free.</Q>
(Page 11.)</P>
<P>Were this granted, what is the Consequence? How will it follow, from hence, that God is not <HI>sovereign</HI> in the Donation of his <HI>special Grace?&mdash; God did foresee, or rather see,</HI> the World of Mankind in just such a State as it is in, an apostate guilty impotent State, utterly un|deserving of any Favour at his Hands. He saw that none of the human Race, without the renewing Influences of his Spirit, would accept of the most gracious and free Offers of Pardon and Salvation, which he has made them through the Merits of his dear Son: <HI>He</HI> saw it to be his merciful good Pleasure (this their Guilt and Obstinacy notwith|standing) to bestow <HI>special Grace</HI> upon some (and not upon others) of this apostate Race, whereby they should be drawn to a Compliance with the Gospel-Offer, and to an Acceptance of Christ Jesus and his saving Benefits.&mdash; He <HI>saw,</HI> from Eternity, each individual Person, who would be the Subject of his <HI>special Grace</HI>; and every individual Person that would not.&mdash;And he <HI>saw,</HI> that every one of those, whom in sovereign Mercy He is pleased to draw to CHRIST (and none but they) would <HI>come to him,</HI> and through him be eternally happy.&mdash;How unreasonable therefore, and utterly inconsistent with the divine Perfec|tions, as well as with the Word of God, is Dr. <HI>Iohnson</HI>'s Notion of the <HI>Decrees.</HI>
<Q>ALL the Notion (he tells us) he can have of the <HI>Decrees</HI> of God is, that he decreed that this should be the Result of Things, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Righteous</HI> should be <HI>happy,</HI> and the <HI>Wicked</HI> be <HI>miserable.</HI>&mdash; And he can't but think, that whatever Objections may seem to lie against this from the <HI>Foreknowledge</HI> of God, must arise only from the Narrowness of our own Way of conceiving Things.</Q>
(P. 10.)&mdash;But I must tell him, that an inspired <HI>Apostle</HI> had quite another Way of thinking. Rom. viii.29, 30. <HI>Whom he did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oreknow, he also did pred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son. And whom he did pred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stinate, them he also called; and whom he called, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</HI> &mdash; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Language of Scripture; and this a necessary Deduction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Nature of Things.&mdash; If there be a GOD, he must be <HI>om|niscient,</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="005761_0075_0000000000000000">
and must know, not only in <HI>general,</HI> the future States of the <HI>Righteous</HI> and the <HI>Wicked,</HI> but the State of each individual Person.&mdash; He must even number the very Hairs of our Head: <HI>he must foresee, or rather see, every Thing certainly</HI> AS BEING WHAT IT IS; and there|fore every Event must certainly be according as he eternally <HI>knew</HI> it would be.&mdash; This <HI>Knowledge</HI> of His (as I have before observed) must agree with all his other <HI>Perfections</HI>; and therefore must agree with his <HI>Will</HI>; unless we should blasphemously suppose a Discord &amp; Jar among the divine Attributes.&mdash;Hence, a divine <HI>Decree</HI> with Respect to each in|dividual Person, necessarily follows from the <HI>Foreknowledge,</HI> or (if Dr. <HI>Iohnson</HI> won't allow us, in the Language of Scripture to use this Word) from the infinite eternal <HI>Knowledge</HI> of God.&mdash; But we are told, that <HI>God knew necessary Events, as being necessary; and contingent Events, as being such.</HI>&mdash;I am surprized, to find a Gentleman of the <HI>Dr</HI>'s Capacity talk at this Rate. Does he indeed think, that there is any Thing <HI>contingent</HI> with Respect to God?&mdash; With Respect to us indeed, Futurities are contingent, and it is from the Defectiveness of our Knowledge and Power, that they are so. But has not he himself told us with Respect to God, that
<Q>by one single Act, one infinite all-comprehending View, to which all Things that with Respect to our narrow limited Minds are past, present, or to come, are equally and at once present.</Q>
How then, I beseech him, can any Thing be <HI>con|tingent,</HI> either liable to be, or not to be, with Respect to God, with whom they are actually <HI>present,</HI> and <HI>in View.</HI></P>
<P>Another Thing worthy of Remark, is the <HI>Dr's Paraphrase</HI> upon the <HI>ninth</HI> Chapter to the <HI>Romans.</HI> In which he tells us, that
<Q>he cannot find one Syllable relating to the <HI>future eternal</HI> Condition of particu|lar <HI>Persons</HI>; it being only a Vindication of God's <HI>Sovereignty</HI> in dealing with whole <HI>Nations</HI> of Men; and particularly in electing the <HI>Iews</HI> at first, and rejecting them now; and calling the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to be his <HI>peculiar People,</HI> to enjoy peculiar Talents and Favours in <HI>this</HI> World.</Q>
(Page 13.)&mdash; But I would inquire of him, whether it ben't just arguing, from the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God towards whole <HI>Nations</HI> of Men (some of whom are left in the Way of <HI>Destruction,</HI> while o|thers are brought into the Way of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI>) to the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God with Respect to particular <HI>Persons.</HI>&mdash; I think he can hardly pretend, that God is <HI>sovereign</HI> with Respect to Men in <HI>general</HI>; and not <HI>sovereign</HI> with Respect to <HI>Individuals</HI>: That he is <HI>sovereign</HI> with Respect to his <HI>withholding</HI> Grace from the <HI>Iews,</HI> and not <HI>sovereign</HI> in the <HI>Donation</HI> of Grace to whom he pleases among the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> &mdash; Could not then the <HI>Apostle</HI> justly deduce this Consequence from those Premises, that God as a Sovereign has Right to <HI>have Mercy upon whom he will have Mercy</HI>; and to <HI>harden whom he will?</HI> And is it not a <HI>Fact,</HI> most notorious and open to every one's Observation, that the Apostle does reason after this Manner?&mdash; Dr. <HI>Iohnson</HI> tells us,
<Q>It is <HI>only</HI> with Respect to the Bestowment of certain Privileges and Talents in <HI>this Life,</HI> that St. <HI>Paul</HI> is to be understood in the <HI>Text</HI> now cited.</Q>
(Page 15.)&mdash; But let any unprejudic'd Person read the 22d and 23d
<PB N="78" REF="005761_0076_0000000000000000">
<HI>Verses</HI> of that Chapter, and see whether they can perswade themselves to believe such a Gloss. <HI>What if God willing to shew his Wrath, and to make his Power known, endured with much Long-Suffering, the Vessels of Wrath fitted for Destruction: And that he might make known the Riches of his Glory, on the Vessels of Mercy, which he had afore prepared unto Glory!</HI>&mdash; There needs no other Remark upon these Words, than to observe, that if they are consistent with the <HI>Dr</HI>'s Interpretation, and if they refer to <HI>this Life only,</HI> then <HI>Words</HI> must be no longer consider'd as <HI>Signs of Ideas</HI>; nor must we pretend to know the Meaning of Scripture, by the Language of it.</P>
<P>There is one Thing more, which calls for some Attention in Dr. <HI>Iohnson</HI>'s Letter, which is a long Discourse to prove that there are <HI>Pro|mises</HI> of <HI>special Grace</HI> made to <HI>unregenerate</HI> Persons, <HI>while such.</HI> Upon which Subject he challenges his Antagonist, with an assuming Air, in the following Words.
<Q>Pray, Sir, let me ask you, <HI>Are</HI> there <HI>Promises</HI>? or are there <HI>not</HI>?&mdash; If you say, there are <HI>not,</HI> as your Argument seems plainly to import, I must think we are laid under a <HI>Necessity</HI> of being <HI>deceived.</HI> For surely no Words can express <HI>Promises,</HI> if those of the Scriptures do not.</Q>
(Page 23.)&mdash; And yet after this pointed Challenge, he does in the same Page fairly give up the whole Cause.
<Q>I own (<HI>says he</HI>) that the <HI>Matter</HI> of the <HI>Promises,</HI> is Matter of mere <HI>sovereign free Grace.</HI></Q>
And again,
<Q>Which <HI>Right</HI> there|fore he has granted us (I allow) not to plead in the Virtue of any Thing <HI>we can do</HI>; but <HI>merely</HI> in the Virtue of what CHRIST <HI>has done for us,</HI> in whom alone it is, that the <HI>Promises</HI> are <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>A|men.</HI></Q>
&mdash; Well then! The <HI>Matter</HI> of the <HI>Promises,</HI> according to his own Representation of the Case, is, That God will give <HI>divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f|ficacious Aid, or special Grace to</HI> one, <HI>not yet throughly converted from Sin to God,</HI> upon his <HI>being deeply sensible of his own Guilt and Weakness, his earnestly coming to God for Help, and striving in earnest, that he may be qualified for God's Help.</HI> (Page 25.)&mdash; This, according to him, is the <HI>Matter</HI> of the <HI>Promises</HI>; and in <HI>this</HI> he him|self acknowledges God to be <HI>sovereign</HI>: That is, (if I understand what <HI>Sovereignty</HI> means) God may <HI>bestow</HI> this <HI>Matter of the Promises,</HI> or may <HI>withhold</HI> it, according to his own <HI>good Pleasure.</HI> Here then the Debate may end. For I know of no Body who contends for more than <HI>this.</HI>&mdash; If now we look into the <HI>other Concession</HI> of his, the same Consequence will follow. Are we to plead for the Good of the <HI>Pro|mise, not in the Virtue of any Thing We can do?</HI> Then it is certainly true, that we can do nothing by any <HI>Sollicitude for Salvation,</HI> by any <HI>Sensibility of our Guilt and Weakness,</HI> by any <HI>earnest Cries to God for Help,</HI> or by any <HI>Striving that we may be qualified for God's Help,</HI> which will give us a Claim to the Good of the <HI>Promise.</HI> Here then the Debate may rest again.&mdash; For who contends for more than this? Are we to plead for the Good of the <HI>Promise, merely in the Virtue of what</HI> CHRIST <HI>has done for us?</HI> I think, Dr. <HI>Iohnson</HI> must allow, that none can <HI>sincerely</HI> do this, without a saving <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ: For how can any <HI>sincerely</HI> plead in <HI>the Virtue of what Christ has done for us,</HI> that
<PB N="79" REF="005761_0077_0000000000000000">
don't sincerely <HI>believe</HI> in him, and rely on his Merits? And whoever doubted, that all the <HI>Promises</HI> of the Gospel were made to <HI>true Belie|vers?</HI>&mdash;Once more, Are <HI>all the Promises Yea and Amen in</HI> CHRIST <HI>a|lone?</HI>&mdash; Surely then, none can claim the Good of the <HI>Promises,</HI> but they who are <HI>interested in</HI> CHRIST by a lively Faith. How can those that are Neglecters and Rejecters of this Saviour, be Partakers of the Benefits treasured up <HI>in him,</HI> and to be obtain'd <HI>only through him,</HI> in whom <HI>they have no Part or Lot?</HI>&mdash;Here then again <HI>ex Ore suo</HI> the Con|troversy is finished. For every Body allows them to be interested in the <HI>Promises,</HI> who are interested in <HI>Christ,</HI> the Fountain, the Foundation, and the Treasury of them <HI>all.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dr.</HI> goes on to argue,
<Q>If you <HI>allow</HI> there are <HI>Promises,</HI> where is the Absurdity in supposing, nay, what else can be made of them, but that God designed to pass over a <HI>Right,</HI> at least a <HI>conditional</HI> Right to his Creatures, of what he <HI>promises</HI> them?</Q>
(<HI>Ibid.</HI>)&mdash; But how will this serve the <HI>Dr</HI>'s Cause?&mdash; They have <HI>no Right</HI> then, till they comply with the <HI>Conditions,</HI> upon which the <HI>Promises</HI> are made. And what are <HI>they?</HI> Let Dr. <HI>Iohnson</HI> shew, if he can, <HI>one Text</HI> in the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble, wherein a <HI>Promise</HI> of special Grace is made upon any lower Con|dition, than <HI>gracious Sincerity in seeking.</HI> It is true, <HI>continued Supplies</HI> of Grace are promised to the sincere Seeker: but we are every where assured, that none other have a Claim to the <HI>Supply of the Spirit of Christ.</HI>&mdash;Sincere Seeking is what none but a truly <HI>regenerate</HI> Soul is ca|pable of; and therefore none but such do <HI>comply</HI> with the Terms, and have thereby a Claim to the Good of the <HI>Promise.</HI> He that don't <HI>ask in Faith, nothing wavering, must not think to receive any Thing of the Lord.</HI> Jam. i.6, 7.&mdash; But we are told, that "<HI>it is absurd, 'tis to make perfect Nonsense of the precious Promises of God,</HI> to interpret the Pro|mises in <HI>Matth.</HI> vii.7&mdash;11, 28. <HI>Luke</HI> xi.13. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in this View. &mdash; But wherein, I beseech the <HI>Dr.</HI> does this <HI>Absurdity</HI> and <HI>Nonsense</HI> consist? Do true <HI>Believers</HI> stand in Need of <HI>no Favours</HI> from God? Should they not ask them of him? Or should they not be animated to <HI>ask</HI> and <HI>seek</HI> for <HI>them,</HI> from the gracious <HI>Promise</HI> of <HI>receiving</HI> and <HI>finding?</HI> Is there no <HI>Door</HI> of Mercy, which Believers want to have (at least fur|ther) <HI>opened</HI> to them; at which they have therefore Occasion to <HI>knock</HI>? &mdash; Is not the <HI>Way</HI> in which that <HI>Rest</HI> promised to the <HI>heavy laden,</HI> may be expected, <HI>their coming to Christ</HI>; which is but another Word for the Exercise of <HI>Faith</HI> in him? Can they therefore claim the <HI>Promise,</HI> before they comply with the Terms of it; before they <HI>come to Christ,</HI> and are true Believers in him?&mdash;Where then is the <HI>Nonsense</HI> of all this; or the <HI>Absurdity</HI> of any Part of it?&mdash;But that this Point may be put beyond all Doubt, we may observe, the <HI>Promises,</HI> in both the Places quoted by him, are expresly made to the <HI>Children of God</HI>; and the Matter of the <HI>Promise,</HI> (or the Good in it) to be expected from their <HI>heavenly Father.</HI> They therefore who have no Right to that <HI>Character,</HI> have no Claim to those <HI>Promises.</HI>&mdash; The <HI>Multitude</HI> who attended upon our Saviour's Preaching when the <HI>Promises</HI> were made, were not indeed in general the <HI>Children of God by Faith in Christ</HI>: Yet there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no Impropriety
<PB N="80" REF="005761_0078_0000000000000000">
in representing to 'em, the glorious <HI>Privilege</HI> connected with this <HI>Cha|racter,</HI> that they might be animated to an earnest Care, to get into that happy State.</P>
<P>To conclude, tho' there be (strictly speaking) <HI>no Promise</HI> of special Grace to unconverted Sinners, yet there is great <HI>Encouragement,</HI> for the Unregenerate to lie at the Footstool of God's <HI>sovereign Mercy,</HI> for the gracious Influences of his blessed Spirit. This is the Way in which they are directed to seek: This is the Way in which they are encou|raged to <HI>hope</HI>: This is the Way, in which Multitudes have <HI>sought</HI> and <HI>obtain'd</HI>: And this is the <HI>only</HI> Way, in which they have any Warrant, to look for renewing, sanctifying, and saving Mercy. Nor is there any <HI>Promise</HI> whatsoever, that can prove a sufficient Incentive to Duty, where these <HI>Considerations</HI> fail of that Effect.</P>
<P>May the glorious God grant us to experience the Power of his spe|cial effectual Grace in our Hearts (whatever speculative Mistakes we are liable to) and carry on his Work in our Souls; till the Imperfec|tion of our Knowledge shall vanish away, 'till our Charity be perfected, and Grace compleated in eternal Glory, thro' Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour. AMEN.</P>
