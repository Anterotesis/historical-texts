<HEAD>God's Mercy surmounting Man's Cruelty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>REmarkable and many have been the Providences of God re|wards his People for their Delive|rance in a Time of Trouble, by which we may behold as in lively Characters, the Truth of that Saying&punc; That <HI>he is a God nigh at hand, and always ready to help and assist those that fear him, and put their Confidence in him.</HI></P>
<P>The Sacred Writings give us In|stances of the Truth hereof, in Days of Old, as in the Case of the <HI>Israel|ites, Iob, David, Daniel, Paul, Silas,</HI> and many others. Besides which, our modern Histories have plentifully abounded with Instances of God's Fatherly Care over his People, in their sharpest Trials, deepest Distres|ses, and sorest Exercises by which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> may know he is <HI>a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> that chan|geth

not, but is the same Yesterday, to Day and for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Among the many modern Instances, I think, I have not met with a more singular One, of the Mercy and pre|serving Hand of God, than in the Case of <HI>Elizabeth Hanson,</HI> Wife of <HI>Iohn Hanson</HI> of <HI>Knoxmarsh</HI> in <HI>Ke|cheachey,</HI> in <HI>Dover</HI>-Township, in <HI>New-England,</HI> who was taken into Capti|vity the 27th Day of the 6th Month, call'd <HI>August,</HI> 1724, and carried away with four Children, and a Servant, by the <HI>Indians</HI>; which Relation, as it was taken from her own Mouth, by a Friend, differs very little from the Original Copy, but is even almost in her own Words. (what small Altera|tion is made being partly owing to the Mistake of the Transcriber) which take as follows,</P>
<P>AS soon as they discovered them|selves (having as we under|stood by their Discourse, been sculk|ing in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> some Days, watch|ing

their Opportunity when my dear Husband with the rest of our Men, were gone out of the Way) two of these barbarous Salvages came in up|on us, next Eleven more, all naked, with their Guns and Tomahauks came into the House in a great Fury upon us, and killed one Child im|mediately, as soon as they entred the Door, thinking thereby to strike in us the greater Terror, and to make us more fearful of them.</P>
<P>Then in as great Fury the Cap|tain came up to me; but at my Re|quest, he gave me Quarter; there being with me our Servant, and Six of our Children, two of the lit|tle Ones being at Play about the Or|chard, and my youngest Child but Fourteen Days old, whether in Cra|dle or Arms, I now mind not: Being in that Condition, I was very unfit for the Hardships I after met with, which are briefly contained in the fol|lowing Pages.</P>
<P>They next go to rifling the House in a great Hurry, (fearing, as I

suppose, a Surprize from our Peo|ple it being late in the Afternoon&punc;) and packed up some Linnen&punc; Wool|len, and what other Things pleased them best; and when they had done what they would, they turned out of the House immediately, and being at the Door, Two of my younger Children, One Six, and the other Four Years old, came in Sight, and being under a great Surprize, cryed aloud, upon which one of the <HI>Indians</HI> running to them, takes one under each Arm, and brings them to us. My Maid prevailed with the biggest to be quiet and still; but the other could by no Means be prevailed with, but continued screaking and crying very much, in the Fright, and the <HI>Indians</HI> to ease themselves of the Noise, and to prevent the Danger of a Discovery that might arise from it, immediately before my Face, knockt its Brains out. I bore this as well as I could, not daring to appear di|sturb'd, or shew much Uneasiness&punc; lest they should do the same to the
<PB N="7" REF="002996_0005_0FEFAB44D836A778">
other: But should have been exceed|ing glad they had kept out of Sight till we had been gone from our House.</P>
<P>Now having kill'd two of my Children, they scalp'd 'em (a Prac|tice common with these People, which is, when-ever they kill any <HI>English</HI> People, they cut the Skin off from the Crown of their Heads, and car|ry it with them for a Testimony and Evidence that they have kill'd so many, receiving sometimes a Reward of a Sum of Money for every Scalp) and then put forward to leave the House in great Haste, without doing any other Spoil than taking what they had pack'd together, with my self and little Babe Fourteen Days old, the Boy Six, and two Daughters, the one about Fourteen, and the other about Sixteen Years, with my Servant Girl.</P>
<P>It must be considered that I having lain-in but 14 Days&punc; and being but very tender and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word">, being remo|ved now out of a good Room well
<PB N="8" REF="002996_0006_0FEFAB46687CE228">
accommodated with Fire, Bedding, and other Things suiting a Person in my Condition, it made these Hardships to me greater than if I had been in a strong and healthy Frame; yet for all this, I must go or die. There was no Resistance.</P>
<P>In the Condition aforesaid we left the House, each <HI>Indian</HI> having some|thing; and I with my Babe and three Children that could go of themselves. The Captain, tho' he had as great a Load as he could well carry, and was helped up with it, did for all that, carry my Babe for me in his Arms, which I took to be a Favour from him. Thus we went thro' several Swamps and some Brooks, they care|fully avoiding all Paths of any Track like a Road, lest by our Footsteps we should be followed.</P>
<P>We got that Night, I suppose, not quite ten Miles from our House, on a direct Line; then taking up their Quarters, lighted a Fire&punc; some of them lying down while others kept Watch; I being both wet and weary, and
<PB N="9" REF="002996_0007_0FEFAB4981A445D8" MS="y">
lying on the cold Ground in the open Woods, took but little Rest.</P>
<P>However, early in the Morning, we must go just as Day appeared, travelling very hard all that Day thro' sundry Rivers, Brooks and Swamps, they as before, carefully a|voiding all Paths, for the Reason al|ready assign'd: At Night I was both wet and tyred exceedingly, having the same Lodging on the cold Ground in the open Woods. Thus for 26 Days, Day by Day, we travelled very hard, sometimes a little by Water o|ver Lakes and Ponds; and in this Journey we went up some very high Mountains so steep, that I was forc'd to creep up on my Hands and Knees, under which Difficulty the <HI>Indian</HI> my Master, would mostly carry my Babe for me, which I took as a great Favour of God that his Heart was so tenderly inclined to assist me, tho' he had, as is said, a very heavy Burden of his own; nay, he would some|times take my very Blanket, so that I had nothing to do, but take my
<PB N="10" REF="002996_0008_0FEFAB4C934E0058">
little Boy by the Hand for his Help, and assist him as well as I could, taking him up in my Arms a little at Times, because so small, and when we came at very bad Places, he would lend me his Hand, or coming behind, would push me up before him: In all which, he shewed some Humanity and Civi|lity more than I could have expect|ed: For which Privilege I was secret|ly thankful to God as the moving Cause thereof.</P>
<P>Next to this, we had some very great Runs of Water and Brooks to wade thro', in which at Times&punc; we met with much Difficulty, wading often to our middle, and sometimes our Girls were up to their Shoulders and Chins the <HI>Indians</HI> carrying my Boy on their Shoulders. At the Side of one of these Runs or Rivers, the <HI>Indians</HI> would have my eldest Daugh|ter <HI>Sarah</HI> to sing them a Song: Then was brought into her Remembrance that Passage in the 137th Psalm, <HI>By the Rivers of</HI> Babylon <HI>there we sat down, yea we wept when we remem|ber'd
<PB N="11" REF="002996_0009_0FEFAB4EED7A97E8">
Zion; we hanged our Harps on the Willows in the midst thereof; for there they that carryed us away cap|tive required of us a Song, and they that wasted us, required of us Mirth.</HI> When my poor Child had given me this Account, it was very affecting, and my Heart was very full of Trouble, yet on my Child's Account, I was glad that she had so good an Inclination, which she yet further manifested in longing for a Bible, that we might have the Comfort in rreading the Holy Text, at vacant Times, for our Spiritual Comfort under our present Affliction.</P>
<P>Next to the Difficulties of the Ri|vers, were the prodigious Swamps and Thickets, very difficult to pass thro'; in which Places my Master would sometimes lead me by the Hand a great Way together, and give me what Help he was capable of un|der the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="ink smeared" EXTENT="1 word"> we went thro'; and we passing one after another, the first made it pretty passable for the hindmost&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002996_0010_0FEFAB524F2A2BF0">But the greatest Difficulty that de|serves the first to be named, was Want of Food, having at Times no|thing to eat but Pieces of old Beaver-Skin-Match-Coats, which the <HI>Indians</HI> having hid (for they came naked as is said before) which in their going back again they took with them, and they were used more for Food than Rayment: Being cut out in long nar|row Straps, they gave us little Pie|ces, which by the <HI>Indians</HI> Example we laid on the Fire till the Hair was singed away, and then we eat them as a sweet Morsel, experimentally knowing, that <HI>to the hungry Soul every bitter thing is sweet.</HI></P>
<P>It's to be consider'd further, that of this poor Dyet we had but very scanty Allowance; so that we were in no Danger of being over-charged. But that which added to my Trou|ble&punc; was the Complaints of my poor Children, especially the little Boy. Sometimes the <HI>Indians</HI> would catch a Squirrel, or a Beaver, and at other Times, we met with Nutts, Berries
<PB N="13" REF="002996_0011_0FEFAB53E3ACEF40">
and Roots they digg'd out of the Ground, with the Bark of some Trees: But we had no Corn for a great while together, tho' some of the younger <HI>Indians</HI> went back, and brought some Corn from the <HI>English</HI> Inhabitants, the Harvest not being gathered, of which we had a little allowed us: But when they caught a Beaver, we liv'd high while it lasted, they allowing me the Guts and Gar|bage for my self and Children: But not allowing us to clean and wash them as they ought, made the Food very irksome to us, in the Conceit of our Minds, to feed upon, and nothing besides pinching Hunger could have made it any way tolerable to be born. But <HI>that makes every bitter Thing sweet.</HI></P>
<P>The next Difficulty was no less hard to me; for my daily Travel and hard Living made my Milk dry al|most quite up, and how to preserve my poor Babe's Life was no small Care on my Mind, having no other Sustenance for it, many Times, but
<PB N="14" REF="002996_0012_0FEFAB57233CC080">
cold Water, which I took in my Mouth, and let it fall on my Breast, (when I gave it the Teat,) to suck in, with what it could get from the Breast; and when I had any of the Broth of the Beaver, or other Guts, I fed my Babe with it, as well as I could: By which Means, thro' Care to keep it as warm as I could, I pre|served its Life till I got to <HI>Canada,</HI> and then I had some other Food, of which more in its Place.</P>
<P>Having by this Time got conside|rably on the Way, the <HI>Indians</HI> part; and we must be divided amongst them. This was a sore Grief to us all: But we must submit, and no Way to help our selves. My eldest Daugh|ter was first taken away, and carryed to another Part of the Country far distant from us, where for the present, we must take Leave of her, tho' with a heavy Heart.</P>
<P>We did not travel far after this, before they divided again, taking my second Daughter and Servant Maid from me, into another Part of the
<PB N="15" REF="002996_0013_0FEFAB5A5A6A7380">
Country: So, I having now only my Babe at my Breast, and little Boy six Years old, we remained with the Captain still: But my Daughter and Servant underwent great Hardships after they were parted from me, tra|velling three Days, without any Food, taking nothing for Support, but cold Water; and the third Day, what with the Cold, the Wet, and Hunger, the Servant fell down as dead in a Swoon, being both very cold and wet, at which the <HI>Indians</HI> with whom they were, were surpriz'd, shewing some Kind of Tenderness, being unwilling then to lose them by Death, having got them so near home, hoping if they lived, by their Ransom to make considerable Profit by them.</P>
<P>In a few Days after this, they got near their Journey's End, where they had more Plenty of Corn and other Food: But Flesh often fell very short, having no other Way to depend on for it, but hunting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 span"> when that failed, they had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word"> short Com|mons.
<PB N="16" REF="002996_0014_0FEFAB5CA498BE70">
It was not long ere my Daughter and Servant were likewise parted; and my Daughter's Master being sick, was not able to hunt for Flesh: Neither had they any Corn in that Place, but were forced to eat Bark of Trees for a whole Week.</P>
<P>Being almost famished in this Di|stress, Providence so ordered that some other <HI>Indians</HI> hearing of their Misery and Want, came to visit them; (these People being very kind and helpful to one another, which is very commendable) and brought unto them the Guts and Liver of a Bea|ver, which afforded them a good Re|past, being but Four in Number, the <HI>Indian,</HI> his Wife and Daughter, and my Daughter.</P>
<P>By this Time my Master and our Company got to our Journey's End, where we were better fed at Times, having some Corn and Venison, and wild Fowl, or what they could catch by hunting in the Woods; and my Master having a large Family, being Fifteen in Number, we had at Times
<PB N="17" REF="002996_0015_0FEFAB5F1F1AC0D8">
very short Commons, more especially when Game was scarce.</P>
<P>But here our Lodging was still on the cold Ground in a poor Wigwam, (which is a kind of little Shelter made with the Rinds of Trees and Mats for a Covering, something like a Tent.) These are so easily set up and taken down, that they oft remove them from one Place to another: Our Shoes and Stockings being done, and our other Cloaths wore out in that long Journey thro' the Bushes and Swamps, and the Weather com|ing in very hard, we were poorly defended from the Cold, for Want of Necessaries; which caused one of my Feet, one of the little Babe's, and both the little Boys to freeze, and this was no small Exercise, yet thro' Mercy, we all did well.</P>
<P>Now tho' we got to our Journey's End, we were never long in one Place, but very often moved from one Place to another, carrying their Wigwams with them&punc; which they could do, without much Difficulty.
<PB N="18" REF="002996_0016_0FEFAB6165042E58">
This being for the Conveniency of Hunting, made our Accommodations much more unpleasant than if we had continued in one Place, by rea|son the Coldness and Dampness of the Ground, where our Wigwams were pitched, made it very unwhole|some and unpleasant Lodging.</P>
<P>Being now got to the <HI>Indian</HI> Fort, many of the <HI>Indians</HI> came to visit us, and in their Way welcom'd my Ma|ster home; and held a great Rejoy|cing, with Dancing, Firing Guns, Beating on hollow Trees, instead of Drums, shouting, drinking and Feast|ing after their Manner, in much Ex|cess for several Days together, which I suppose, in their Thoughts, was a Kind of Thanks to God put up for their safe Return and good Success: But while they were in their Jolli|try and Mirth, my Mind was great|ly exercised towards the Lord, that I, with my dear Children separated from me, might be preserved from re|pining against God, under our Afflic|tion on the one Hand, and on the other, we might have our Dependance
<PB N="19" REF="002996_0017_0FEFAB63BB025E78">
on him who rules the Hearts of Men, and can do what pleases in the King|doms of the Earth, knowing that his Care is over them who put their Trust in him; but I found it very hard to keep my Mind as I ought, under the Resignation which is pro|per to be in, under such Afflictions and sore Trials, as at that Time I suffer'd, in being under various Fears and Doubts concerning my Children, that were separated from me, which helpt to add to, and greatly encrease my Troubles: And herein I may tru|ly say, my Afflictions are not to be set forth in Words to the Extent of them.</P>
<P>We had not been long at home ere my Master went a hunting, and was absent about a Week, he ordering me in his Absence to get in Wood, ga|ther Nuts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I was very diligent, cutting the Wood, and putting it in Order, not having very far to carry it: But when he returned, having got no Prey, he was very much out of Humour, and the Disappoint|ment was so great, that he could
<PB N="20" REF="002996_0018_0FEFAB662BC4AE70">
not forbear revenging it on us poor Captives. However he allowed me a little boyled Corn for self and Child, but with a very angry Look threw a Stick or Corn-Cob at me, with such Violence as did bespeak he grudged our Eating. At this his Squaw and Daughter broke out in a great Cry|ing. This made me fear Mischief was hatching against us: And on it, I immediately went out of his Pre|sence into another Wigwam; upon which he comes after me, and in great Fury tore my Blanket off my Back, and took my little Boy from me and struck him down as he went along before him; But the poor Child not being hurted, only frighted in the Fall, he started up and ran away, without crying; then the <HI>Indian</HI> my Master left me; but his Wife's Mo|ther came and sat down by me, and told me, <HI>I must sleep there that Night.</HI> She then going from me a little Time, came back with a small Skin to co|ver my Feet withal, informing, that my Master intended now to kill us;
<PB N="21" REF="002996_0019_0FEFAB68757CE2E8">
and I being desirous to know the Reason, expostulated, that <HI>in his Ab|sence I had been diligent to do as I was ordered by him.</HI> Thus, as well as I could, I made her sensible how un|reasonable he was. Now, tho' she could not understand me, nor I her, but by Sgns, we reasoned as well as we could: She therefore makes Signs that I must die, advising me, by pointing up with her Fingers, in her Way, to pray to God, endeavouring by her Signs and Tears to instruct me in that which was most needful, <HI>viz.</HI> to prepare for Death, which now threatned me; the poor old Squaw was so very kind and tender, that she would not leave me all that Night, but laid her self down at my Feet, de|signing what she could to asswage her Son-in-law's Wrath, who had conceived Evil against me, chiefly as I understood, because the Want of Victuals urged him to it. My Rest was little this Night, my poor Babe sleeping sweetly by me.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="002996_0020_0FEFAB6B0B45F4B0">I dreaded the tragical Design of my Master, looking every Hour for his coming to execute his bloody Will upon us: But he being weary with his Hunting and Travel in the Woods, (having toyled for nothing) went to Rest, and forgot it. Next Morning he applied himself again to hunting in the Woods; but I dread|ed his returning empty, and prayed secretly in my Heart, that he might catch some Food to satisfy his Hun|ger, and cool his ill Humour. He he had been gone but a little Time till returned with Booty, having shot some wild Duck; and now he appear|ed in a better Temper, ordering the Fowls to be dress'd with Speed; for these kind of People, when they have Plenty, spend it as freely as they get it; spending in Gluttony and Drunk|enness in two Days Time, as much, as with prudent Management might serve a Week. Thus do they live, for the most Part, either in Excess of Gluttony and Drunkenness, or under great Straits for Want of Necessaries.
<PB N="23" REF="002996_0021_0FEFAB6D708DE6B0">
However in this plentiful Time I felt the Comfort of it in Part with the Family, having a Portion sent for me and my little ones, which was very acceptable. Now, I thinking to my self the Bitterness of Death was over for this Time, my Spirits were a little easier.</P>
<P>Not long after this, he got into the like ill Humour again, threat|ning to take away my Life. But I always observed when-ever he was in such a Temper, he wanted Food, and was pinched with Hunger. But when he had Success in hunting, to take either Bears, Beavers, Bucks or Fowls, on which he could fill his Belly, he was better humoured, tho' he was na|turally of a very hot and passionate Temper, throwing Sticks, Stones, or whatever lay in his Way, on every slight Occasion. This made me in continual Danger of my Life: But That God whose Providence is over all his Works, so preserved me, that I never received any Damage from him that was of any great Conse|quence
<PB N="24" REF="002996_0022_0FEFAB6FCA4F86C0">
to me; for which I ever desire to be thankful to my Maker.</P>
<P>When Flesh was scarce, we had only the Guts and Garbage allowed to our Part; and not being permit|ted to cleanse the Guts any other|wise than emptying the Dung, with|out so much as washing them, as be|fore is noted, in that filthy Pickle we must boil them, and eat them, which was very unpleasant: But Hun|ger made up that Difficulty, so that this Food which was very often our Lot, became pretty tolerable to a sharp Appetite, which otherwise by no Means could have been dispensed with. Thus I consider'd, none knows what they can undergo, till they are tryed: For what I had thought in my own Family, nor fit for Food, would here have been a Dainty-Dish and a sweet Morsel.</P>
<P>By this Time, what with Fatigue of Spirits, hard Labour, mean Diet, and often Want of Natural Rest, I was brought so low, that my Milk was dryed up, my Baby very poor
<PB N="25" REF="002996_0023_0FEFAB721A679CF0">
and weak, just Skin and Bone; for I could perceive all its Joynts from one End of the Babe's Back to the other; and how to get what would suit its weak Appetite, I was at a Loss; on which one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Squaws perceiving my Uneasiness a|bout my Child, began some Discourse with me, in which she advised me to take the Kernels of Walnuts, and clean them, and beat them with a little Water, which I did, and when I had so done, the Water look'd like Milk; then she advised me to add to this Water, a little of the finest of the <HI>Indian</HI> Corn Meal, and boyl it a little together. I did so, and it be|came palatable, and was very nou|rishing to the Babe, so that it began to thrive and look well; which was before more like to die than live. I found that with this kind of Diet the <HI>Indians</HI> did often nurse their Infants. This was no small Com|fort to me: But this Comfort was soon mixed with Bitterness and Trouble, which thus happen'd; My
<PB N="26" REF="002996_0024_0FEFAB74636493D0">
Master taking Notice of my dear Babe's thriving Condition, would often look upon it, and say, <HI>when it was fat enough, it should be killed, and he would eat it</HI>; and pursuant to his Pretence, at a certain Time, he made me to fetch him a Stick that he had prepared for a Spit, to roast the Baby upon, as he said, which when I had done, he made me sit down by him, and undress the In|fant. When the Child was naked, he felt its Arms, Legs, and Thighs, and told me, <HI>It was not fat enough yet; I must dress it again until it was better in Case.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho' he thus acted, I could not perswade my self, that he intend|ed to do as he pretended; but only to aggravate and afflict me: Neither ever could I think but our Lives would be preserved from his barba|rous Hands, by the over-ruling Pow|er of him in whose Providence I put my Trust, both Day and Night.</P>
<P>A little Time after this my Master fell sick, and in his sickness, as he
<PB N="27" REF="002996_0025_0FEFAB76B0C13B50">
lay in his Wigwam, he order'd his own Son to beat my Son: But the old Squaw, the <HI>Indian</HI> Boy's Grand|mother, would not suffer him to do it: Then his Father, my Master, be|ing provoked, catches up a Stick ve|ry sharp at one End, and with great Violence threw it from him, at my Son, and hit him on the Breast, with which my Child was much bruised, and the Pain, with the Surprize, made him turn as pale as Death; I en|treating him not to cry, and the Boy tho' but Six Years old, bore it with wonderful Patience, not so much as in the least complaining, so that the Child's Patience asswaged the Barba|rity of his hard Heart: who, no Doubt, would have carryed his Pas|sion and Resentment higher, had the Child cryed, as always Complaining did aggravate his Passion, and his Anger grew hotter upon it. Some little Time after, on the same Day he got upon his Feet, but far from be|ing well. However, tho' he was sick, his Wife and Daughter let me
<PB N="28" REF="002996_0026_0FEFAB78F8CEF418">
know, he intended to kill us, and I was under a Fear, unless Providence now intercepted, how it would end, I therefore put down my Child, and going out of his Presence, went to cut Wood for the Fire, as I used to do, hoping that would in Part, allay his Passion; but withal ere I came to the Wigwam again, I expected my Children would be killed in this mad Fit, having no other Way but to cast my Care upon God, who had hither|to helped and cared for me and mine</P>
<P>Under this great Feud, the old Squaw, my Master's Mother-in-law left him; but my Mistress and her Daughter abode in the Wigwam with my Master; and when I came with my Wood, the Daughter came to me, whom I asked, if her Father had kill'd my Children, and she made me a Sign, <HI>No,</HI> with a Countenance that seem'd pleas'd it was so; for instead of his further venting his Passion on me and my Children, the Lord, in whom I trusted, did seasonably inter|pose,
<PB N="29" REF="002996_0027_0FEFAB7B4AA75F08">
and I took it as a merciful De|liverance from him, and the <HI>Indian</HI> was under some Sense of the same as himself did confess to them about him afterwards.</P>
<P>Thus it was a little after he got up on his Feet, the Lord struck him with great Sickness, and a violent Pain, as appeared by the Complaint he made in a doleful and hideous Manner; which when I understood, not having yet seen him, I went to another Squaw, that was come to see my Master, which could both speak and under|stand <HI>English,</HI> and enquired of her if my Mistress (for so I always called her, and him Master) thought that Master would die? She answer'd <HI>Yes, it was very likely he would, being worse and worse:</HI> Then I told her, <HI>He struck my Boy a dreadful Blow with|out any Provocation at all, and had threatned to kill us all in his Fury and Passion</HI>; upon which the Squaw told me, <HI>My Master had confessed the Abuse he offered my Child, and that the Mis|chief he had done, was the Cause why
<PB N="30" REF="002996_0028_0FEFAB7DA4EA7080">
God afflicted him vnto that Sickness and Pain; and he had promised never to abuse us in such Sort more&punc;</HI> And after this he soon recovered, but was not so passionate; nor do I remember he ever after struck either me or Children, so as to hurt us, or with that mischievous Intent as before he used to do. This I took as the Lord's Doing, and it was marvellous in my Eyes.</P>
<P>Some few Weeks after this, my Master made another Remove, ha|ving, as before, made several: But this was the longest ever he made, it be|ing two Day's Journey, and mostly upon the Ice. The first Day's Journey the Ice was bare, but the next Day some Snow falling, made it trouble|some, very tedious and difficult tra|velling; and I took much Damage in often falling, having the Care of my Babe, that added not a little to my Uneasiness; and the last Night, when we came to encamp, it being in the Night, I was ordered to fetch Water: But having fate a while on
<PB N="31" REF="002996_0029_0FEFAB80138F1868">
the cold Ground, I could neither go nor stand; but crawling on my Hands and Knees, a young <HI>Indian</HI> Squaw came to see our People, being of another Family, in Compassion took the Kettle, and knowing where to go, which I did not, fetcht the Water for me. This I took as a great Kind|ness and Favour, that her Heart was inclined to do me this Service.</P>
<P>I now saw the Design of this Jour|ney; my Master being, as I suppose, weary to keep us, was willing to make what he could of our Ransom; there|fore he went further towards the <HI>French,</HI> and left his Family in this Place, where they had a great Dance, sundry other <HI>Indians</HI> coming to our People, This held some Time, and while they were in it, I got out of their Way in a Corner of the Wig|wam as well as I could: But every Time they came by me, in their Dancing, they would bow my Head towards the Ground, and frequently kick me with as great Fury as they could bear, being sundry of them
<PB N="32" REF="002996_0030_0FEFAB827B409828">
barefoot, and others having <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="ink smeared" EXTENT="1 word"> Mocossons: This Dance held some Time, and they made (in their Man|ner) great rejoycings and Noise.</P>
<P>It was not many Days ere my Master returned from the <HI>French</HI>; but he was in such a Humour, when he came back, he would not suffer me in his Presence&punc; Therefore I had a little Shelter made with some Boughs, they having digg'd thro' the Snow to the Ground, the Snow being pret|ty deep. In this Hole, I and my poor Children were put to lodge, the Weather being very sharp, and hard Frost in the Month called <HI>Ianuary,</HI> made it more tedious to me and poor Babes. Our Stay not being long in this Place, he took me to the <HI>French,</HI> in Order for a Chapman; and when we came among them, I was exposed to Sale, and he asked for me 800 Li|vres: But the <HI>French</HI> not complying with his Demand, put him in a great Rage, offering him but 600, he said in a great Passion, <HI>If he could not have his Demand, he would make a great
<PB N="33" REF="002996_0031_0FEFAB84CB7BE160">
Fire&punc; and burn me and the Babe in the View of the City,</HI> which was named <HI>Port-Royal.</HI> The <HI>Frenchman</HI> bid the <HI>Indian</HI> make his Fire, <HI>and I will,</HI> says he, <HI>help you, if you think that will do you more Good than</HI> 600 <HI>Livres,</HI> cal|ling my Master <HI>Fool,</HI> and speaking roughly to him, bid him be gone. But at the same Time, the <HI>Frenchman</HI> was very civil to me; and for my Encouragement, <HI>bid me be of good Cheer, for I should be redeemed, and not go back with them again.</HI></P>
<P>Retiring now with my Master for this Night, the next Day I was re|deemed for 600 Livres, and in treat|ing with my Master, the <HI>Frenchman</HI> queried, <HI>Why he asked so much for the Babe's Ransom,</HI> urging, <HI>when it had its Bellyful, it would die</HI>; My Master said, <HI>No, it would not die, having already li|ved</HI> 26 <HI>Days on nothing but Water, be|lieving the Babe to be a Devil.</HI> The <HI>Frenchman</HI> told him, <HI>No, the Child is order'd for longer Life; and it has pleased God to preserve it to Admira|tion.</HI> My Master said, <HI>No it was a
<PB N="34" REF="002996_0032_0FEF96D4B1E23BB0">
Devil, and he believed it would not die&punc; unless they took a Hatchet, and bent its Brains out.</HI> Thus ended their Discourse, and I was, as aforesaid, with my Babe, ransomed for 600 Li|vres, my little Boy, likewise at the same Time, for an additional Sum of Livres was redeemed also.</P>
<P>I now having changed my Land|lord, my Table and Diet, as well as my Lodging, the <HI>French</HI> were civil beyond what I could either desire or expect. But the next Day after I was redeemed, the <HI>Romish</HI> Priests took my Babe from me, and according to their Custom, they baptized it (ur|ging if it died before That, it would be damned, like some of our modern pretended reformed Priests) and they gave it a Name as pleased them best; which was <HI>Mary Ann Frossways,</HI> telling me, <HI>My Child, if it now died&punc; would be saved, being baptized</HI>; and my Landlord speaking to the Priest that baptized it, said, <HI>It would be well now</HI> Frossways <HI>was baptized, for it to die, being now in a State to
<PB N="35" REF="002996_0033_0FEFAB88D4267668">
be saved.</HI> But the Priest said, <HI>No, the Child having been so miraculously pre|served thro' so many Hardships, it may be designed by God for some great Work, and by its Life, being still continued, may much more glorify God than if it should now die.</HI> A very sensible Re|mark, and I wish it may prove true&punc;</P>
<P>I having been about five Months amongst the <HI>Indians,</HI> in about one Month after I got amongst the <HI>French,</HI> my dear Husband, to my unspeaka|ble Comfort and Joy, came to me, who was now himself concerned to redeem his Children, two of our Daughters being still Captives, and only my self and two little ones re|deemed; and thro' great Difficulty and Trouble he recover'd the young|er Daughter: But the eldest we could by no Means obtain from their Hands, for the Squaw, to whom she was gi|ven, had a Son which she intended my Daughter should in Time be pre|vailed with to marry; the <HI>Indians</HI> being very civil toward their captive Women, not offering any Incivility by
<PB N="36" REF="002996_0034_0FEFAB8CAD18D490">
any indecent Carriage (unless they be much overgone in Liquor, which is commendable in them so far.</P>
<P>However the Affections they had for my Daughter, made them refuse all Offers and Terms of Ransom; so that after my poor Husband had wait|ed&punc; and made what Attempts and En|deavours he could, to obtain his Child, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="ink smeared" EXTENT="1 span"> we were for|ced to make homeward, leaving our Daughter to our great Grief, behind us, amongst the <HI>Indians,</HI> and set for|wards over the Lake, with Three of our Children&punc; and Servant-Maid, in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="ink smeared" EXTENT="1 span"> with sundry others, and by the Kindness of Providence we got well home on the first Day of the Seventh Month, 1725. From which it appears I had been from home a|mongst the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> about Twelve Months, and Six Days.</P>
<P>In the Series of which Time, the many Deliverances and wonderful Providences of God unto us, and over us, have been, and I hope will so re|main to be as a continued Obligation</P>
<PB N="37" REF="002996_0035_0FEFAB8E3496A580">
<P><ADD>on my Mind ever to live in that Fear, Love and Obedience to God, duly re|garding, by his Grace, with Meekness and Wisdom, to approve myself by his Spirit, in all Holiness of Life, and God|liness of Conversation, to the Praise of him that hath called me, who is God blessed forever.</ADD></P>
<P><ADD>But my dear Husband, poor Man! could not enjoy himself in Quiet with us, for Want of his dear Daughter Sa|rah, that was left behind; and not wil|ling to omit any thing for her redemp|tion which lay in his Power, he could not be easy without making a second Attempt; in order to which, he took his Journey about the nineteenth Day of the Second Month, 1727, in com|pany with a Kinsman and his Wife, who went to redeem some of their Chil|dren, and were so happy as to obtain what they went about: But my dear Husband being taken sick on the way, grew worse and worse, as we were in|formed, and was sensible he should not get over it; telling my Kinsman, that, if it was the Lord's Will he must die</ADD></P>
<PB N="38" REF="002996_0036_0FEFAB8FC0208820">
<P><ADD>in the Wilderness, he was freely given up to it. He was under a good Compo|sure of mind, and sensible to the last Moment, and died, as near as we can guess, in about the Half-way between Albany and Canada, in my Kinsman's Arms, and is at rest, I hope in the Lord: And though my own Children's loss is very great; yet I doubt not but his gain is much more; I therefore desire and pray that the Lord will enable me patiently to submit to his will in all things he is pleased to suffer to my lot while here, earnestly supplicating the God and Father of all our mercies, to be a Father to my fatherless Children, and give unto them that Blessing which maketh truly rich, and adds no sorrow to it; that as they grow in years they may grow in Grace, and experience the Joy of his Salvation, which is come by Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen.</ADD></P>
<P><ADD>Now though my Husband died, by reason of which his Labor was ended, yet my Kinsman prosecuted the thing, and left no Stone unturned that he</ADD></P>
<PB N="39" REF="002996_0037_0FEFAB924C289450">
<P><ADD>thought, or could be advised, was proper to the obtaining my daugh|ter's Freedom; but could by no means prevail; for as is before said (she be|ing in another part of the Country distant from where I was) and given to an old Squaw, who intended to mar|ry her in time to her Son, using what persuading she could to effect her end, sometimes by fair Means, and sometimes by severe. In the mean time a Frenchman interposed and they, by persuasion enticed my Child to marry, in order to obtain her Free|dom, by reason that those Captives married by the French, are by that Marriage made free among them, the Indians having then no pretence longer to keep them as Captives, she therefore was prevailed upon, for the reasons afore assigned, to marry, and she was accordingly married to the Frenchman.</ADD></P>
<P><ADD>Thus, as well, and as near as I can from my memory, (not being capable of keeping a Journal) I have given a short, but a true Account of</ADD></P>
