<HEAD>A Supplement to an Act of this Government, en|tituled, An ACT for the better Confirma|tion of the Owners of Lands, &amp;c. in their just Rights and Possessions.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS by the Laws of this Government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preamble.</NOTE> formerly made for confirming the Owners of Lands in their just Rights, and for Quieting the Pos|session of such as were <HI>bona fide</HI> Purchasers of Lands within this Government, for a valuable Consideration, are found not to be sufficient to answer the good Ends proposed in the said Laws: And forasmuch as at the first Settlement of these Counties, and for a long Time after, the Inhabitants were very unskilful in making Deeds and Wills, or Conveying and Devising of Lands, which heretofore were but of very small Value in these Counties, and by the Laws of this Government were al|ways subject to be taken in Execution, and sold for the Payment of Debts, as well as to be sold by Executors and

Administrators for the Payment of the Debts of their Intestates and Testators, and for Maintenance of their Children, &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS, through the Negligence of some Persons who have been intrusted with the Offices of Clerks and Registers of this Government, not only many of the Records of the several Courts of Judicature, Or|phans Courts, &amp;c. within this Government, are burned, or otherwise lost and destroyed; but even some of the former Laws are imbezzelled, so that, except where it appears by the Recitals of such Deeds as are yet in be|ing, there is no legal Proof can be made of the Judg|ments, Orders or Decrees, by Virtue whereof many Lands within these Counties have been sold, and many Wills, Powers of Agency, and Letters of Attorney, are not now to be found, to warrant the Sales and Conveyances of Lands made by Executors or other Persons, who are said to have had Authority to sell by Virtue of the Powers contained in the said Wills, Powers of Agency, or Letters of Attorney.</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS, through the Unskilfulness which so generally prevailed formerly in this Government among Persons pretending to be Scriveners, or to have some Understanding in the Law, sundry Lands have been devised to the Children of the Testators, without the Ad|dition of the Word <HI>Heirs,</HI> or any other Word, by which, in Construction of Law, such Devises could be understood to be any other than Estates for Life, though it has been well known that the Intention of the Testator has been otherwise; and therefore, by constant Usage, the Children of such Testators, claiming under such Devises, have held the Lands as Estates of Inheritance, and have sold, and devised the same accordingly: And other Testators and Scriveners, for Want of a due Understanding and Know|ledge of the Nature of Devises, and Distinction between Words which make an Estate in Fee-simple, and Fee-tail, have devised Lands to their Children, and their Issue, or their Heirs or Issue of their Bodies, or to them and their Children; when it has been known that all that was in|tended by the Testator was no more, than that the Lands should go to his Child or Children, and their Heirs; and yet the Devisees, for Want of being truly informed of the legal Construction of such Devises, have, as soon as they had Children, conceived themselves to have a good Right
<PB N="113" REF="006835_0112_0000000000000000">
to devise or sell the Lands so devised to them, and have disposed of the same accordingly; and oftentimes when it hath happened that such Devisees have died, but have not sold such Lands in their Life-time, and have left Issue, who in Construction of Law were really the Heirs or Issue in Tail, such Issue, from a Belief of their having an Estate of Inheritance in the Lands so devised to them, have de|vised, or for a valuable Consideration, sold or mortgaged the said Lands.</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS the former Assemblies of this Government, considering that rough and unimproved Lands were of very little Value, and that if Persons having any Right or Title to Lands within this Government, should neglect to take Possession, or claim the same in a reasonable Time, and by that Means, Persons being igno|rant of the Claim of such Owners, should purchase the same Lands for a valuable Consideration, of other Persons, who have had the same surveyed to them, or of Persons pretending to be the true Heir or Heirs of the first Owners of such Lands, and such Purchaser should afterwards, at a great Expence of Labour and Money, render the same Lands of considerable Value by their Improvements, and die, and leave the said Lands to their Children: It was therefore provided by a Law of this Government, above <HI>Thirty</HI> Years ago, that <HI>Seven</HI> Years quiet Possession of Lands within these Counties, which were first entered on upon an equitable Right, should give an unquestionable Title to the same, excepting as in the same Act is ex|cepted: And the People of this Government generally trusting to the Equity of that Law, and the Provision therein made for quieting Men's Possessions, many honest Persons, ignorant of the Titles of Lands, have purchased Lands and Tenements within this Government under the Circum|stances before in this Act mentioned, which Purchases have been made <HI>bona fide,</HI> and for a valuable Considera|tion, and the Purchasers, and those claiming under them, have hitherto continued in the peaceable and quiet Posses|sion of the said Lands, without any Claim made by any Persons pretending Right or claiming the same as Heirs or Owners, or Heirs in Tail, Remainder or Reversion; and many of the said Lands so devised and sold as aforesaid, have been taken afterwards in Execution, and sold for the Payment of the Debts of the Persons to whom they have afterwards been sold, and others of the said Lands have been taken into the respective Loan-Offices of this Go|vernment,
