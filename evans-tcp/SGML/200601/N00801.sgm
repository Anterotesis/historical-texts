<P>AT what time, or on what occa|&s;ion this <HI>P&s;alm</HI> was penned by <HI>David,</HI> we are not told; how|ever the Contents of it give us to under&s;tand, that it was a time of com|plicated trouble with him; his Enemies were grown in&s;olent, and gave him great mole&s;tation; and his Sins mean while pained his Con&s;cience, and di&s;quieted his

mind; it may therefore be well &s;uppo&s;ed to refer to the di&s;turbances which were occa&s;ioned by <HI>Ab&s;aloms</HI> unnatural Rebel|lion, which was con&s;equent upon, and a threatned correction for his great &s;in in the matter of <HI>Uriah.</HI> The <HI>P&s;alm</HI> there|fore is a prayer of Faith with which he addre&s;&s;eth God in this condition; and is made up of petitions, and pleas where|with tho&s;e petitions are enforced; intro|duced with a profe&s;&s;ion of his recumben|cy on God in the mid&s;t of his di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 1, 2. The Petitions, though inter|woven in the <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> may be reduced to two heads, <HI>viz.</HI> for deliverance from his Enemies, and a di&s;charge from the Guilt of his Sins; in each whereof he fortifies his Faith, and &s;trengthens his importuni|ty with &s;uitable arguments. Our <HI>Text</HI> is a <HI>Petition</HI> of the latter &s;ort. In the words we may ob&s;erve;</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Object</HI> to whom he directs it, the <HI>Lord</HI>; the word is, <HI>Jehovah,</HI> which is a proper and incommunicable name of God, and is no where a&s;cribed to any &s;econd being what&s;oever, but to the true God alone.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="000964_0004_0FADE49DCF0759E0">2. The benefit which he petitioneth for, <HI>viz. pardon or forgivene&s;s</HI>; the word properly &s;ignifies to pardon, or to &s;pare of free grace or mercy, without any the lea&s;t de&s;erving in the Subject to whom it is applied: and <HI>Criticks</HI> ob&s;erve that it is mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed in the Law of <HI>Mo|&s;es,</HI> for &s;uch a forgivene&s;s as is afforded, upon an oblation that hath been offered to God for the expiation of the Guilt contracted by the per&s;on; &s;o that we may here &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> to have an eye of Faith upon the Sacrifice of Chri&s;t, which was to &s;atisfie the Ju&s;tice of God, in order to the obtaining of a Pardon for Sinners. Pardon pre&s;umes Guilt, and &s;uppo&s;eth it to be removed by it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;pecial Subject about which he petitioneth this benefit to be conferred upon him; <HI>mine iniquity:</HI> and here two things are to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is Iniquity, in the &s;ingular num|ber. I confe&s;s the word is &s;ometimes u|&s;ed in the &s;ingular number, as a name of multitude, comprehending in it all the Sins which the per&s;on hath ever been
<PB N="6" REF="000964_0005_0FADE4A3A8027650">
guilty of: but it &s;eems here to refer <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome one, which his Con&s;cience was pe|culiarly wounded with the remembrance of, and may probably refer to that com|plicated &s;in of his that he had been guilty of, which hath already been mentioned; and the word here rendred, <HI>Iniquity,</HI> &s;ig|nifies <HI>pravity,</HI> or <HI>perver&s;ene&s;s,</HI> and is u&s;ed for the more bold and high-handed tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, that men do &s;ometimes run them&s;elves into; the word is al&s;o often intended for <HI>Original Sin,</HI> which is the pravity or perver&s;ene&s;s of our nature, and unto which we ought to have a re|&s;pect in all our Confe&s;&s;ions of &s;in unto God.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is his own &s;in, <HI>mine iniquity</HI>; he doth not lay it upon any other, but a&s;|&s;umeth it wholly and entirely to him&s;elf, and acknowledgeth that he hath rendred him&s;elf Guilty by it; under which there is nece&s;&s;arily implied a confe&s;&s;ion, both of the &s;in it &s;elf as chargeable upon him, and al&s;o of the de&s;erved Guilt that he hath contracted to him&s;elf by it.</P>
<P N="4">4. The arguments by which he &s;treng|thens
<PB N="7" REF="000964_0006_0FADE4A3DE83B0F8">
his Faith in making of this petiti|on: indeed, every word doth tacitly carry an argument or plea in it, as might be made evident, but there are two which are expre&s;&s;ed in the <HI>Text; viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. He pleads Gods <HI>Name</HI> for it: By the Name of God we are to under&s;tand God him&s;elf, as he hath revealed him&s;elf unto us in his Glorious Perfections, in which alone we can &s;ee any good ground to hope or pray for pardon; and hence it either points us to the <HI>Attributes</HI> them|&s;elves, which &s;hine forth in the procuring and applying of this forgivene&s;s; or to the Glory which will redound to tho&s;e <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ributes</HI> by it; or to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> who is the purcha&s;er of this mercy for us, and may be equivalent to that in, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.17. <HI>Hear the prayer,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>for the Lords &s;ake</HI>; and God him&s;elf hath &s;aid concerning Chri&s;t, <HI>Exod.</HI> 23.21. <HI>My name is in him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He looks upon the greatn<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> of his &s;in, <HI>for it is great.</HI> To what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ead we are to refer this argument, is matter of di&s;pute, and accordingly there is a diffe|rent reading given to it by Interpreters&punc;
<PB N="8" REF="000964_0007_0FADE4A492C8BB28">
The particle tran&s;lated <HI>for,</HI> is variou&s;ly u&s;ed in the Scriptures; and more fre|quently in two &s;en&s;es: it is &s;ometimes u&s;ed <HI>Illatively,</HI> to bring in the rea&s;on of that which went before, and then it is read <HI>for,</HI> and thus our Tran&s;lation under|&s;tand it: and &s;o it is u&s;ed by <HI>David</HI> as an argument to enforce his pleading for pardon from God, in regard of the great|ne&s;s of his &s;in; &s;ometimes it is u&s;ed <HI>di&s;|cretively,</HI> upon the grant of a thing which might &s;eem to look to the contrary, and then it is read <HI>although</HI>; and &s;o have &s;ome rendred it in our <HI>Text:</HI> and then it is put to encourage faith to &s;eek a par|don notwith&s;tanding the greatne&s;s of his &s;in; that he fortifieth again&s;t the di&s;cou|ragement which that might afford him. The word <HI>great,</HI> is u&s;ed in the Scriptures both for <HI>magnitude</HI> and <HI>multitude,</HI> and is to be tran&s;lated according as the &s;en&s;e will carry it, and both of them are often comprehended. If we take &s;in here <HI>aggregatively,</HI> to comprehend all his &s;ins, both original and actual; it then intends that they are very many, and grievou&s;ly
<PB N="9" REF="000964_0008_0FADE4A555FBEE00">
aggravated; but if we under&s;tand it on|ly for &s;ome one particular and &s;pecial &s;in; it then intends that it is a very great one, and that it hath a great many wrapt in it; and the <HI>pronoun</HI> particle, which is rendred <HI>it,</HI> is Emphatical: it intimateth as much, as if he did point with his fin|ger to the particular iniquity, and &s;ay of it, <HI>this, this is a very great &s;in</HI>&punc;</P>
<P>There are a great many precious prac|tical Truths contained or implied in the&s;e words, which I cannot willingly overpa&s;s without &s;ome brief glance at them, be|fore I come to the Ca&s;e &s;pecially intend|ed from them, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. I. <HI>The Children of God may &s;ometimes fall into very Great Sins. David</HI> was &s;uch an one at this time: he was a true Believer, <HI>a man after Gods own heart</HI>; and yet he acknowledgeth his Sin, and puts that note upon it. Every Sin is great, as it is again&s;t God, and is a Violation of his Law; for the lea&s;t affront offered to that glorious being cannot be &s;mall: but there are &s;ome which are aggravated
<PB N="10" REF="000964_0009_0FADE4A66D6EA168">
Sins; either as they are the more direct breaches of &s;ome of the greater and more leading Commands of God, or as they are awfully circum&s;tanced, by which they are rendred the more pre&s;umptuous; and &s;uch was that of <HI>David</HI> in both re&s;pects, as we &s;hall find it amplified on in, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12. <HI>begin.</HI> That Godly men may fall into &s;uch Sins, there needeth no more to make it evident, than the in&s;tances of &s;uch in the word of God, which are there pur|po&s;ely recorded for our learning and warning. Be&s;ides, <HI>Original Sin,</HI> which re|mains in all Gods people as long as they live, hath every lu&s;t comprized in it, it being a whole <HI>Body of Death,</HI> and if God leaveth them to them&s;elves, it will drag them into Captivity. So <HI>Paul</HI> complains of it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.23. And God doth &s;ome|times &s;o leave them, as is &s;aid of him, 2 Chron. 32.31. <HI>God left him, to try him.</HI> Gods people are under the Command, as it is a Rule of Obedience, and every tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion or coming &s;hort in it is a Sin; nor doth their being his Children make it no Sin, or a little one: but it is a noto|rious
<PB N="11" REF="000964_0010_0FADE4A7ABED54B0">
aggravation of it that &s;uch as are &s;o related to him, and are thus obliged by him, do &s;o. God hath holy ends in his thus leaving them; and will hereby humble them out of their carnal confi|dence, and magnify his Grace in Saving of them.</P>
<P>USE. <HI>Let this then caution &s;uch as pre|tend to be the Children of God, and that in two re&s;pects.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Beware of thinking your neglects or violations of the Command to be no Sins. How many have ruined their own Souls, by mi&s;under&s;tanding of that <HI>Text? Rom.</HI> 6.14. <HI>Ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</HI> As if Lying, Stealing, Swearing Whordom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were no Sins if done by a Believer, but had lo&s;t the nature of Sin, becau&s;e &s;uch do them. Such pretenders are &s;trangers to the Grace of God, and &s;hall know their delu&s;ion to their co&s;t &s;ooner or later.</P>
<P N="2">2. Take heed of carnal confidence and negligence. That is a duty incumbent on all the people of God, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.15. <HI>See
<PB N="12" REF="000964_0011_0FADE4A84FB299B8">
that ye walk circum&s;pectly</HI>: And we here &s;ee what great rea&s;on there is for the con|&s;tant practi&s;ing of it. There is &s;carce one Sin, though never &s;o foul and filthy, but you may be drawn into it, if God &s;hall withdraw his preventing Grace from you; and you will grievou&s;ly provoke him &s;o to do, if you thus neglect your &s;elves&punc; and there are continual Sollicitations that will be offered to draw you into them: let therefore the thought of this be a moni|tour to you <HI>not to be high minded, but to fear</HI>&punc;</P>
<P>DOCT. II. <HI>When God brings outward troubles on his People, the&s;e Sins of theirs may peculiarly trouble them.</HI> Thus it was with the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> at this time; and this gave the Occa&s;ion for his putting up the peti|tion in our <HI>Text.</HI> God &s;ometimes brings per&s;onal afflictions on his own, for their tryal, as he did upon <HI>Job</HI>; and yet then it is good for them to make a diligent &s;earch after Sin in them&s;elves. But very often they are the corrections which he lays on them for &s;ome bold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of theirs: and, becau&s;e he intends to u&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="000964_0012_0FADE4ABDB2FB398">
them for their Correction and amend|ment, he therefore gives them &s;ome notice or other about tho&s;e Sins, either by his Word and Ordinances, directing his Ser|vants to meet with them, or in the very Language of the Providences them&s;elves; with which he toucheth their Con&s;ciences, and makes them reflect, and charge &s;uch Sins upon them&s;elves. Thus he did unto <HI>David,</HI> by <HI>Nathan</HI> in, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12. <HI>begin</HI>&punc; and by <HI>Gad,</HI> when he had <HI>numbred the People, Chap.</HI> 24.10. And when it is &s;o, they are more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the con&s;ideration of their &s;in, than with the affliction that is procured by it. Yea this is it which puts the greate&s;t bitterne&s;s into the affliction it &s;elf, and well it may, becau&s;e hereby they di&s;cern anger in the rod, which is more terrible to them than all the rage of Death and Hell: yea they could be con|tented to be corrected, &s;o they might but be a&s;&s;ured that it were not in wrath, but in love and compa&s;&s;ion; hence that re|que&s;t of the Prophet, <HI>Jer</HI> 10.24. <HI>Oh Lord, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, le&s;t thou bring me to nothing</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="000964_0013_0FADE4ACB53F8010">USE. <HI>Let &s;uch as fear God take this for a dayly watch word, to make them afraid of every Temptation to &s;in.</HI></P>
<P>It may be for the pre&s;ent, you may &s;wallow the bait, and not feel the hook to prick you, but you know not how &s;oon God may in his Providence vi&s;it you with &s;ome remarkable affliction, and then bring this &s;in to your remembrance, and if he do, you will find the bitterne&s;s of it; little do you think at pre&s;ent, how much gall and wormwood this will put into the Cup: now the la&s;hes of Con&s;ci|ence within, will be more terrible than all the outward &s;troaks of Providence, though never &s;o &s;evere. Now it will be a comfortable Cordial, to be able at &s;uch a time to &s;ay as the Church, P&s;al&punc; 44.17, 18. <HI>All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt fal&s;ly in thy Covenant. Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way</HI> And to appeal with him, Job 16.17. <HI>Not for any injustice in mine hand; al&s;o my prayer is pure.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="000964_0014_0FADE4ACD893BF80">DOCT. III. <HI>There is &s;ometimes one &s;in&punc; that lies more heavily on the Con&s;cience of Gods Children, in a time of trouble.</HI> The de&s;ign of Affliction indeed, is to put us upon the making of a thorough &s;earch for all &s;in; but oftentimes there is &s;ome one that gives &s;pecial occa&s;ion for the affliction, God being peculiarly provoked by it, and thereupon the Spirit of God bears it more heavily on the Con&s;cience at &s;uch a time than any other, though thereby he leads us up to the fountain of all, as he did <HI>David,</HI> P&s;al. 53.3. <HI>with</HI> 5. <HI>I know my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and my &s;in is ever before me; behold I was &s;hapen in iniquity</HI>; and it is e|vident that God is more e&s;pecially di&s;ho|noured by &s;ome one &s;in, than by others, and the &s;in it &s;elf is more prodigious and pre&s;umptuous, and leaves deeper wounds in the Soul, which when the &s;en&s;e there|of is revived, draw our thoughts that way, and God will leave proportionable impre&s;&s;ions on our hearts thereby.</P>
<P>USE. <HI>And let this be a constant caution
<PB N="16" REF="000964_0015_0FADE4AD98834C90">
to us to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> how we give way to the temptations of &s;in that are urged upon us.</HI></P>
<P>Doth God at any time make one &s;in &s;o bitter to us, that we cannot endure the terrours of it, but are ready to &s;ink under them; the burden of them hath &s;uch a load that we are oppre&s;&s;ed with it, and roar under it? Surely he doth here|by caution us to look to our ways, and beware of multiplying tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions a|gain&s;t him; if one be &s;o terrible, what will many be? this &s;hould put force in that argument, and make it powerful in our re&s;i&s;tance, Gen 39 9. <HI>How can I do this great wickedne&s;s and &s;in again&s;t God?</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. IV. <HI>The Sins of Gods own peo|ple stand in need of forgivene&s;s.</HI> Not only tho&s;e &s;ins which they committed before they were Converted; and their per&s;ons were Ju&s;tified, but tho&s;e they fall into af|terwards do need a pardon. Though they are as to their &s;tate, delivered from Condemnation, and &s;hall no more be in danger of the Eternal Wrath of God; which is a great encouragement to them
<PB N="17" REF="000964_0016_0FADE4AE571AB410">
to hope for, and to &s;eek remi&s;&s;ion upon their falls: yet when at any time they are overtaken with &s;in, they provoke God thereby, and lay them&s;elves open to his holy Di&s;plea&s;ure, and can have no peace in them&s;elves, or &s;ecurity from his Judgments, till a pardon be gotten. There is a &s;ort of <HI>Guilt</HI> that cleaves to them, which they mu&s;t &s;eek the removal of in order to the re&s;toring of their comfort; he prays for this, P&s;al. 51.12. <HI>Restore un|to me the joy of thy &s;alvation</HI>; for this rea&s;on our Saviour made it a petition to be daily put up by all his Di&s;ciples, Mat. 6.12. <HI>Forgive us our Debts.</HI></P>
<P>USE. <HI>Let this then Excite us, if at any time we are overtaken with any &s;in, to be re&s;tle&s;s till we have obtained the pardon of it.</HI></P>
<P>To this end let us maintain in our &s;elves the exerci&s;e of Repentance. God hath put the&s;e two together, <HI>Acts</HI> 5.31. <HI>Him hath he Exulted by his Right-hand, to give repentance to I&s;rael, and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> Take heed of nouri&s;hing carnal &s;e|curity,

with the pre&s;umption of your ju&s;|tified E&s;tate, and thinking that you are thereby &s;afe, &s;o as that God will not charge any tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion upon you; a&s;|&s;ure we our &s;elves, that &s;in which we have not repented of, and gotten a &s;ealed pardon for, will look terribly upon us, when Con&s;cience &s;hall charge it home, and we have nothing to &s;hew for the forgivene&s;s of it.</P>
<P>DOCT. V. <HI>The Children of God mu&s;t ask for a pardon, if they would obtain it.</HI> God hath appointed a <HI>medium</HI> for the conveyance of tho&s;e &s;aving benefits to his people, which have been purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t for them: and he hath made prayer to be nece&s;&s;ary in this order, <HI>Ezek</HI> 36.37. <HI>I will for this be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to do it for them</HI>; hence that in Jer. 29.12, 13. <HI>Then &s;hall ye go and pray to me, and I will hearken unto you; &amp; ye &s;hall &s;eek me, &amp; find me, when ye &s;hall &s;earch for me with all your heart</HI>; and as he hath required it, &s;o he hath encou|raged it, P&s;al 50.15. <HI>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee.</HI> God
<PB N="19" REF="000964_0018_0FADE4B09028FA68">
hath a pardon ready, only he waits to be asked for it, that we may, by &s;o do|ing, te&s;tify the &s;en&s;e that we have of our need of it, and acknowledge to him his great kindne&s;s to us, when we obtain it. Nor indeed are we in a fit po&s;ture to receive a pardon at his hand, till we are brought upon our knees, that we may take it of him in that humble and pro|&s;trate po&s;ture; and in this prayer there mu&s;t be a cordial &s;en&s;e of the &s;in, and of the great vilene&s;s of it, accompanied with a &s;incere Confe&s;&s;ion of it; and there|fore till we come to this, we may expect to be in &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s; but in this way there is relief to be had. We have an account of <HI>Davids</HI> experience in both the&s;e re&s;pects, P&s;al. 32.3, 4, 5. <HI>When I kept &s;ilence, my bones waxed old,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I ac|knowledged my &s;in to thee,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and thou forgave&s;t the iniquity of my &s;in.</HI></P>
<P>USE. <HI>Let this then direct us what to do, when we are under Conviction and Remor&s;e, by rea&s;on of any &s;in that we have made our &s;elves Guilty by.</HI> Let it direct us to prayer;
<PB N="20" REF="000964_0019_0FADE4B199A08FE8">
and let us encourage our Faith in prayer. Is this the way to obtain forgivene&s;s? let us not be &s;o unwi&s;e as to go without it, for want of &s;o doing: how ju&s;tly will God continue us under our di&s;tre&s;s, if we neglect to &s;eek a deliverance from it? and to e&s;tabli&s;h our &s;aith in praying for this benefit, let us con&s;ider that God never rejected any that duly &s;ought to him for it; how many, how great, how aggava|ted &s;oever their &s;ins have been; he waits to be called on, and he takes notice who it is that doth &s;o. Even a per&s;ecuting and malicious <HI>Saul,</HI> when he is made to fall upon his knees, hath that remark made upon him, Acts 9.11. <HI>behold he prays.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. VI. <HI>God alone is to be addre&s;|&s;ed for pardon</HI> We mu&s;t not only ask it, but of him, if we would obtain it. Men may be wronged by us, and if we have offered them any injury, it is our duty to &s;eek reconciliation with them, and at|tend proper means for that end; but it is God who is &s;inned again&s;t, P&s;al. 51.4.

<HI>Again&s;t thee, thee only have I &s;inned</HI>; and therefore he mu&s;t be &s;ought to for a par|don. Forgivene&s;s of &s;in is a Divine pre|rogative; none can apply it authentically to the Sinner but God: if it comes not under his hand and &s;eal, it &s;ignifies no|thing. It is true, we mu&s;t go to him for it in Chri&s;t's name, or el&s;e we &s;hall cer|tainly mi&s;s of it; for it is one of the be|nefits which he hath purcha&s;ed for us, at the price of his own blood; but we mu&s;t not &s;eek it any where el&s;e. The Jews were in the right of it, in <HI>The&s;i,</HI> when they &s;aid, <HI>Mark</HI> 2.7. <HI>None can forgive &s;ins but God.

&s;in have ever been remitted to the Sin|ner in any other way but this; for, nei|ther could he for him&s;elf, nor yet could the whole Creation for him, make a due compen&s;ation to injured Ju&s;tice on his account: <HI>So dear is their Redemption, and it must have cea&s;ed for ever,</HI> P&s;al. 49 8. and that God would thus forgive him, is an act of meer grace, to which he was not at all obliged by any natural nece&s;&s;ity, but was altogether free in it; and the Sinner had given him &s;ufficient provocation righ|teou&s;ly to have de&s;troyed him for ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That hence God u&s;eth his ab&s;olute Soveraignty in chu&s;ing the Subjects of the application of it.</HI> That this pardon is not a priviledge be&s;towed upon all Guilty Sinners, is a truth plentifully born witne&s;s to in the Word of God.

and ten Thou&s;and of Rivers of Oyl</HI> will not do it; and that if it be not provided for and given to us on free co&s;t, we mu&s;t de&s;pair of our getting it. The want of having &s;uch a view of Sin, makes men to think that a confe&s;&s;ion, and overly re|pentance, a good work, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will make amends, make up the breach between God and them, and turn away his wrath from them: whereas this drives them out of their refuges of lies, and &s;hews them that the demerit of Sin out-bids all they can do for the expiation of it, and that therefore they mu&s;t &s;eek &s;ome where el&s;e for it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By di&s;covering that none el&s;e can pardon them but he.</HI> The greatne&s;s of Sin truly di&s;covered carries evidence in it, that it cannot be le&s;s than a Divine work to for|give it. Men that have low thoughts of Sin, reckon a pardon to be nothing; but they that &s;ee how great it is, believe that it is a work of Omnipotency. When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> petitioned God to pardon his peoples &s;in, he reque&s;ts that he will manife&s;t his power in it, <HI>Numb.</HI> 14.17. <HI>And now I be&s;eech thee,
<PB N="57" REF="000964_0056_0FADE4DF925AF980">
let the power of my Lord be great</HI>: and the exten&s;ivene&s;s of his mercy, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 19. <HI>Par|don, I be&s;eech thee, the iniquity of this people, according to the greatne&s;s of thy mercy.</HI> And in this Article God is acknowledged to be incomparable, <HI>Mic.</HI> 7.18. <HI>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and pa&s;&s;eth by the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the remnant of thine heritage?</HI> Nor indeed is there any thing in which he more appears to be God, than in this: and the conviction of it is be|cau&s;e great Sins require a great God to forgive them; and thereupon it mu&s;t be &s;ought of him alone.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By a&s;&s;uring us that if we obtain it not of him, we mu&s;t needs peri&s;h.</HI> When Sin comes to be felt in its weight, it not only &s;aith in our Con&s;ciences that we mu&s;t ei|ther get it removed from us, or el&s;e it will &s;ink us into the nethermo&s;t hell, but al&s;o that we mu&s;t go to God for it, or we are undone. That <HI>De&s;truction</HI> is upon us, and that he only can <HI>Ran&s;om</HI> us from it, by forgiving us. It &s;aith, that if an holy God finds us under the Guilt of the&s;e Sins, and that if we have not re|ceived
<PB N="58" REF="000964_0057_0FADE4DFDF00EB90">
a pardon under his hand, <HI>We cannot e&s;cape the vengeance of Hell.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This Con&s;ideration helps to humble us into a right frame in our coming to God for pardon.</HI> There is a right frame, and only the humble Soul hath it, and this is pro|moved by &s;uch thoughts divers ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It beats us off from our own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI> When we go to God for remi&s;&s;i|on, we would fain carry &s;omething of our own with us, to &s;atisfie our pleadings withal, and encourage our hope for ac|ceptance by, and this proceeds from pride, and is the principal rea&s;on why awaken|ed Sinners &s;tand off, and are not willing to apply them&s;elves to God for it. But when our &s;in appears to be exceeding &s;inful, our hands are now knocked off, we lay a&s;ide all &s;uch preten&s;ions; and now we are made to come as <HI>poor, mi&s;e|rable, blind, and naked</HI> Creatures. This makes true beggars of us, and puts us in|to the po&s;ture of the <HI>Publican,</HI> of whom, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18.13. <HI>The Publican &s;tanding afar off,
<PB N="59" REF="000964_0058_0FADE4E091235828">
would not lift &s;o much as his eyes unto hea|ven&punc; but &s;mote upon his brea&s;t, &s;aying, God be merciful to me a &s;inner.</HI> We now &s;ee that there is no other hope but what re|&s;olves entirely unto Gods mercy.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>It helps us to ju&s;tify God</HI>; and there is no hope for us to &s;peed in asking for|givene&s;s of him, without this. God will have the glory of his free grace, a&s;cribed to him by every one whom he forgiveth; and this will never be, till we plumply confe&s;s that the greate&s;t &s;everity of his Law is very righteous; that we are ju&s;tly condemned, and that there is no inju&s;tice at all to be imputed to him: hence that in, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.8, 9. <HI>To us belongs confu&s;ion of face, to the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivene&s;&s;es</HI>; and we can never come up fully to this, till we &s;ee a world of vilene&s;s in our &s;in, and the more we &s;ee of this, the more will our hearts be per&s;waded of Gods righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is one thing that the Spirit cometh to <HI>convince us of, Joh.</HI> 16 8. and till it be &s;o, Sinners will be ever finding fault with
<PB N="60" REF="000964_0059_0FADE4E158920230">
the Law, and charging cruelty and inju&s;t|ice upon it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It helps us in our confe&s;&s;ions.</HI> There is a thorough confe&s;&s;ion which we ob&s;erv|ed that God expects of us in order to our obtaining forgivene&s;s from him: he would not have us to mince and curtail it, but the more ample and aggravated it is, the more is God honoured by it; becau&s;e it carries in it a di&s;covery of the deeper &s;en&s;e that we have of it on our hearts. He that hath a right conception of the evil there is in Sin, will then &s;ee that he cannot exceed in expatiating on it, and laying of him&s;elf low by it. They are but lank Confe&s;&s;ions which that man will make, who doth not <HI>Know the plague of his own heart,</HI> and how evil and bitter his Sin is: God therefore invites his people to this, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.19. <HI>Know and &s;ee that it is an evil and bitter thing, that thou ha&s;t for&s;aken the Lord thy God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It &s;erves to further our importunity.</HI> Our Cryes for pardon ought to be very urgent and earne&s;t, as of tho&s;e that ap|prehend
<PB N="61" REF="000964_0060_0FADE4E254A1D088">
the forlorn condition that Sin hath put us in; and nothing will make them to be &s;o, but the re&s;entment which we have on our hearts of that &s;in which gives us the Occa&s;ion to pray for pardon. It is felt trouble that draws forth our re|que&s;t to have it removed from us; and therefore the&s;e reque&s;ts will be more or le&s;s earne&s;t in proportion to that &s;en&s;e: light thoughts of &s;in, will produce but flat and complemental petitions about it; but terrible apprehen&s;ions of it, will put us upon loud cryes to have it taken away. Such doubtle&s;s was <HI>Davids</HI> &s;en&s;e, when he prayed in, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 41.4. <HI>Lord, be merciful to me, heal my Soul, for I have &s;inned again&s;t thee.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>It Commends to us the Merits and Obe|dience of Chri&s;t.</HI> We are directed by the Go&s;pel, to &s;eek for pardon on Chri&s;t's ac|count; and we are told that our reliance for the obtaining it, mu&s;t be upon his Sa|tisfaction. Now this &s;hews us how infi|nitely we are beholden to him, for that he hath thus laid in for us, and &s;o it comes to make his Obedience very pre|cious
<PB N="62" REF="000964_0061_0FADE4E2CF888830">
to us. There are none that prize a Saviour &s;o as they do, who have found &s;in to be beyond mea&s;ure evil, and the guilt of it to be beyond any other power of taking it away, but the vertue of his Sacrifice: it will make us to &s;ay with <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.14. <HI>The Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>It makes us re&s;tle&s;s till we get an an|&s;wer of peace from God to our petitions.</HI> They that have &s;lighty conceptions of &s;in, neg|lect their prayers, and regard not what becomes of them: but this will put us upon repeated reque&s;ts, &amp; agreeable fer|vency in them, whiles God &s;eems to de|lay us, and make us to re&s;olve that we will never let him alone, or take a denial of him. He that knows what his &s;in will righteou&s;ly co&s;t him, when he comes to receive his recompen&s;e, if it be not now forgiven, will follow God unweariedly, until he hath given him a &s;ealed pardon; this was it which drew forth tho&s;e repea|ted reque&s;ts which <HI>David</HI> puts up to him, in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="63" REF="000964_0062_0FADE4E723902810">4. <HI>This con&s;ideration will al&s;o &s;erve to help our faith.</HI> Satan indeed, and a mi&s;|giving heart will make u&s;e of it to di&s;|courage us: and put us upon de&s;pair by looking on our &s;ins in their magnitude and multitude; but the Spirit of God, in tho&s;e who are his, fortifies their faith with it, and that in two re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It tells us there is a work for God to do.</HI> God acquaints us in his word, which is the Rule of our faith, that he delights to do like him&s;elf in all his works; and then to di&s;cover his glory to us, when all other help and hope fails us; and what is this but to draw up our <HI>Eyes to him,</HI> when <HI>we cannot tell what do do?</HI> Faith therefore will now argue, what though it out-bids all the power of the Creation to take away the Guilt of the&s;e grievous Sins of mine, yet God can do it, and in doing of it he will give a &s;ignal demon|&s;tration of his power. Faith &s;aith, I know and am fully per&s;waded that God can forgive it if he plea&s;e, let it be never &s;o great, and there is an occa&s;ion now for
<PB N="64" REF="000964_0063_0FADE4E870E695D0">
him to make it appear how &s;ufficient an object of tru&s;t he is, when all other re|fuge fails; and <HI>herein make me a pattern to them that &s;hall hereafter believe on him to life everla&s;ting.</HI> 1 Tim. 1.16.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It al&s;o tells us that he will herein Glo|rify his Grace abundantly.</HI> An eye of faith al&s;o looks upon the great de&s;ign of the New-Covenant, to be the making of the Grace of God to appear in its mo&s;t ori|ent colours: and therefore the believing &s;oul under the deep &s;en&s;e of &s;in, thus ar|gueth; here is an opportunity for the Grace of God to be the mo&s;t re&s;plendent: how will the pardoning mercy of God be herein magnified? how will the inexhau|&s;tible vertue of Chri&s;t's Obedience be here|by demon&s;trated? God will in this get to him&s;elf a name, which &s;hall be celebrated with the mo&s;t joyful acclamations of prai&s;e to eternal ages. It therefore helps us belie|vingly to put up that petition, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 79.9: <HI>Deliver us, and purge away our &s;ins for thy name &s;ake</HI>; and to back it with that &s;ti|mulation, <HI>ver&s;e ult. So we thy people, and &s;heep of thy pa&s;ture, will give thee thanks for
<PB N="65" REF="000964_0064_0FADE4E99582DDD0">
ever; we will &s;hew forth thy prai&s;e to all generations.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>This con&s;ideration will al&s;o help to pre|pare us for a right improving of this pardon, when we have obtained it.</HI> When Gods people have gotten any thing of him in a way of prayer, they ought to return to him the acknowledgment thereof in prai|&s;es, and therein to u&s;e it for his Glory, P&s;al. 50.15. <HI>Call upon me, and I will deli|ver thee, and thou &s;halt glorify me</HI>; and in re&s;pect to pardon, this con&s;ideration will abundantly contribute hereto; for,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It will make us the more to admire the riches of Grace appearing in it:</HI> Gods great aim is at the glory of this, in all the &s;pe|cial favours which he confers upon his own, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.6. <HI>To the prai&s;e of the glory of the riches of his grace</HI>; and the more our hearts are touched with the apprehen&s;ion of this, the more will they be filled with admiration at, and acclamations to it. Now, the greater our &s;ins have been, and found &s;o to be by our right con&s;iderati|on of them, the more doth the grace
<PB N="66" REF="000964_0065_0FADE4EA58492DA8">
appear, that was exerted in the procuring for, and applying to us, a free pardon of them. Such therefore will be alwayes harping upon this &s;tring, and think that they can never enough expatiate on it. This made <HI>Paul</HI> &s;o to commorate on the di&s;playing of the Grace of God that had been manife&s;ted in him, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1, 12. <HI>to</HI> 17.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It will enflame our hearts the more with love to God.</HI> There are none in the world, who&s;e love burneth &s;o bright to|wards Chri&s;t, as of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ins have been exceedingly great, and born home upon their Souls with the apprehen&s;ion of the greatne&s;s of them, to con&s;ider that this notwith&s;tanding, God hath forgiven them all freely. So our Saviour argueth, <HI>Luk.</HI> 7.47. <HI>Her &s;ins which are many are forgiven, for &s;he loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the &s;ame loveth little.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It will make us to walk the more hum|bly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">fterwards.</HI> There is nothing which more helpeth the Grace of Humility, to its perfect working in a Child of God,
<PB N="67" REF="000964_0066_0FADE4EB1DDF6A48">
than the remembrance of what horrible and deep died &s;ins he hath been guilty of, and that yet God &s;hould forgive them. He is ever reflecting on the&s;e two toge|ther; what his Sins have been, and what a pardon is be&s;towed upon him: he will be on all occa&s;ions turning his eye this way; and indeed the greatne&s;s of Sin will never work to a kindly Humiliation, till it be joyned with the apprehen&s;ion of a pardon.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It will help us the more chearfully and &s;tedfa&s;tly to Serve God for the future.</HI> Such an experience as this, when it works kindly on the Soul, will mightily &s;treng|then Obedience; and this is a fruit of that love which it doth produce and ex|cite in the heart: it will, as often as he turns his eye that way, make him to &s;ay as he, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 116.12. <HI>What &s;hall I render to the Lord for all his benefits to me?</HI> and now he thinks that he can never do or &s;uffer too much for the honour of that God who hath &s;o appeared to him.</P>
<P>USE. <HI>Let it &s;erve to direct us in the right

improvement of &s;uch a con&s;ideration as this is; and that may be in two re&s;pects.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Beware of taking Satans glo&s;&s;es.</HI> He will endeavour all he can to make us count Sin to be nothing, &s;o long as he can keep us in carnal &s;ecurity by &s;uch an e&s;teem, and for that end &s;upplies us with arguments of the fle&s;h, accommodated thereto: and when the Spirit of God con|vinceth the man of his &s;in, and &s;o he can hold this device no longer, he then would make our Sin appear great beyond the ex|tent of a pardon, &s;o to precipitate us into de&s;pair: take heed of this, it will drive you from the u&s;e of means, and &s;o undo you.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Oppo&s;e to the con&s;ideration of the great|ne&s;s of your &s;in, and ballance it with the&s;e three things, and e&s;tabli&s;h your faith on them.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The great &s;ufficiency there is in the Re|demption of Chri&s;t.</HI> It is through this that you come to have any hope of a pardon. Hence the Apo&s;tle refers it hither, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.14. <HI>In whom we have Redemption through
<PB N="69" REF="000964_0068_0FADE4EC993988E8">
his blood, even the forgivene&s;s of Sins.</HI> Out of doubt then there is hope for pardon for all tho&s;e &s;ins, which do not exceed the vertue of that Redemption: and this is declared to be very exten&s;ive, Hebr. 7.25. <HI>He is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come to him</HI>; think then what a price he paid for this purcha&s;e: we are put up|on &s;uch a con&s;ideration, 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. <HI>Ye are redeemed, not with corruptible things, as &s;ilver and gold, but with the precious blood of the Son of God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The de&s;ign of the New Covenant.</HI> In that it is that your hope is revealed to you; the Old Covenant had none in it: Now con&s;ider that the opening of that Cove|nant were to &s;et forth the riches of Grace in the &s;alvation of Sinful man by Chri&s;t; &s;o long therefore as you have a pro&s;pect how Grace may be exalted in your be|ing pardoned, let <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">courage you to wait to &s;ee his great &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The contrivance of infinite Wi&s;dom to make Ju&s;tice and Grace to agree in this de|&s;ign.</HI> This is u&s;ually a great di&s;courage|ment in Satans temptation, when Sin is
