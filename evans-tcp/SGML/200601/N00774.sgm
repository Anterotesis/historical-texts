<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THere is a Glorious Prophecy, in Hab. 2 14 <HI>That the knowledge of the Glory of the Lord, &s;hall fill the Earth, as the Waters cover the Sea.</HI> We know, That in all Prophetical Scripture, <HI>People,</HI> are &s;till meant by, <HI>Waters.</HI> The Spirit of Prophecy in this pa&s;&s;age of Scripture, &s;eems to fore-&s;ee, the Improvement and Advancement of Navigation, after the Invention of the <HI>Load&s;tone,</HI> in the Latter Dayes; The <HI>People</HI> &s;hall then <HI>Cover the Sea,</HI> and the <HI>Ocean</HI> &s;hall be <HI>Covered</HI> with Ve&s;&s;els, carrying of Men, to <HI>Do Bu&s;ine&s;s on the Great Waters.</HI> In the Prediction of that matter, 'twas very proper to call, <HI>The People,</HI> by the Name of, <HI>The Waters</HI>; for be&s;ides the Re&s;emblance, which at all times they bear unto the <HI>Waters,</HI> upon which they are now Sailing, their Living on the <HI>Waters</HI> Entitles them to this Denomination, ju&s;t as a Country or City, gives a Denomination to its In|habitants; <HI>Greece</HI> to <HI>Grecians, Rome</HI> to <HI>Romans.</HI> And it is Predicted, That by means of <HI>Navigation</HI> thus grown towards perfection, it will come to pa&s;s, <HI>That the Knowledge of the most Glorious Lord will fill the Earth,</HI> and the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, &s;hall be carried into all Corners of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Lord, Forgive</HI>! the Sinful Neglects of the <HI>Pro|te&s;tant Nations</HI> to make their <HI>Navigation,</HI> Sub&s;er|vient unto the Illu&s;trious De&s;ign, of conveying the <HI>Knowledge of the mo&s;t Glorious Lord,</HI> unto all parts of the Univer&s;e. And let Pious and Zealous men, Seriou&s;ly Con&s;ider, what a Shame it is, that the <HI>Prote&s;tant Nations,</HI> which do &s;o much Exceed the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> in their <HI>Shipping,</HI> &s;hould &s;o far come &s;hort of them, in their Endeavours by their <HI>Shipping</HI> to

<P>In the mean Time, I could not but count it one way of being <HI>Serviceable,</HI> To promote the <HI>Know|ledge,</HI> and <HI>Service of the mo&s;t glorious Lord,</HI> among tho&s;e that profe&s;s the Art of <HI>Navigation</HI>; who, tis mo&s;t proper, &s;hould fir&s;t have it <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> before they will do much to bring <HI>others</HI> into it.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>It is written, in Jon. I. 16.</BIBL>
<P><HI>The men feared the Lord exceedingly.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHAT <HI>men</HI> were the&s;e? The Beginning of the Chapter tells us, The&s;e men were the <HI>Marriners,</HI> of a Ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>Tar&s;hi&s;h</HI>: which <HI>Tar&s;hi&s;h</HI> is by &s;ome Great Geographers, counted, not the <HI>Tar&s;us,</HI> that was the Metropolis of <HI>Calicia,</HI> but rather <HI>Tarte&s;&s;us,</HI> a City in a Spani&s;h I&s;land of the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> But we have now, a point of more Importance to pro&s;ecute, than that <HI>Geo|graphical</HI> Controver&s;y and Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>It has been an Ob&s;ervation, older than the Dayes of <HI>Plato,</HI> That the <HI>Sea is a School of Vice.</HI> It &s;eems, the <HI>Fear of God</HI> is not &s;ound &s;o much among <HI>Sailors,</HI> as one would expect from
<PB N="6" REF="000932_0005_0FAD92FE2B9D0230">
their peculiar Circum&s;tances. Tho' <HI>Seamen</HI> are both Afflicted by God, and Relieved by God, above other men, yet there is not al|ways to be found among them, that <HI>Fear of God,</HI> whereto their Circum&s;tances do oblige them.</P>
<P>'Tis true; In the Sacred Story, we find &s;ome <HI>Seamen</HI> remarkable for the <HI>Fear of God</HI>; And &s;uch Things as they met withal at <HI>Sea,</HI> were the occa&s;ion of it. The&s;e were the <HI>Marriners</HI> of the Ve&s;&s;el, that were carrying <HI>Jonah</HI> to <HI>Tar&s;hi&s;h.</HI> A <HI>Fearful Storm</HI> was by God &s;ent upon them in their Voyage. Both in the <HI>Coming</HI> of the <HI>Storm,</HI> and in the <HI>Cea|&s;ing</HI> of the <HI>Storm,</HI> they could not but evident|ly &s;ee, the <HI>Finger of God.</HI> And, behold, the <HI>Fear of God</HI> was the Effect of what they &s;aw. Before the <HI>Storm,</HI> the&s;e <HI>Marriners</HI> were poor, forlorn, wretched <HI>Idolaters.</HI> But a Mini&s;ter in the Ve&s;&s;el told them of the Lord JEHO|VAH, the True God of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the Great God of <HI>Heaven.</HI> After the <HI>Storm,</HI> they be|came the Wor&s;hippers of that Lord JEHO|VAH, and, <HI>Feared the Lord exceedingly.</HI></P>
<P>Very many of you, O Congregation of the Lord, are <HI>Marriners.</HI> This Neighbour|hood, above other Parts of the Town or Land, may be called, our <HI>Tribe of Zebulon.</HI> You are Witne&s;&s;es, O our Sea-faring Neigh|bours, and all the Neighbours, yea, and the
<PB N="7" REF="000932_0006_0FAD92FEC5862B58">
Holy Angels, are Witne&s;&s;es, of our daily Agonies for your Welfare. <HI>Brethren, our Hearts De&s;ire and Prayer to God, for you, is, that you may be Saved.</HI> We <HI>Fear exceedingly,</HI> Le&s;t you <HI>Steer</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Fal&s;e Cour&s;es</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> which may Entail Di&s;a&s;ters on you, and le&s;t you mi&s;s of a &s;afe Arrival to the Port of Eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; And we <HI>Love exceedingly,</HI> to do all that can be done, to make you Happy. To A&s;&s;i&s;t you in the obtaining of Happine&s;s, I am willing to &s;et before you, the Example of the <HI>Marriners,</HI> that <HI>Feared the Lord excee|dingly.</HI> The <HI>Problem,</HI> which we have now to <HI>Work,</HI> is This;</P>
<P>That Sea-faring People &s;hould be God-fearing People.</P>
<P>Yea, I will carry the point &s;o far, as to &s;ay, That <HI>No men,</HI> are more bound unto the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> than <HI>Seamen.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis to be hoped, That none of our Hea|rers, will count them&s;elves excu&s;ed from the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> There are none of us all, to who&s;e <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> there may not be made that Appeal, in Neh. 5.9. <HI>Ought ye not to walk in the Fear of God?</HI> But the <HI>Sea-faring</HI> Hearers, are to be now Addre&s;t, with this Advice, above the Re&s;t. There are none more obliged than YOU, to <HI>Walk</HI> (and Sail) <HI>in the Fear of God.

You</HI> pa&s;s thro' <HI>Exceeding Hazzards, You</HI> Endure <HI>Exceeding Hard&s;hips, You</HI> Receive <HI>Exceeding Mercies</HI>; and therefore Syrs, it becomes You, to <HI>Fear the Lord exceedingly.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, In the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> now give Attention, to tho&s;e Admonitions, that will a|ri&s;e unto you, from this Important</P>

<HEAD>CASE. In what Manners, and by what Actions, ought <HI>Sea-faring</HI> Per&s;ons, to make it Evident, that their Hearts are Fraighted with the <HI>Fear of God</HI>?</HEAD>
<P>By the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> you know, is meant, <HI>Religion.</HI> I am now to &s;et before you the De&s;cription of A <HI>Religious Marriner.</HI> There are certain Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Religion,</HI> whereby <HI>Sea faring</HI> per&s;ons mu&s;t, as by &s;o many <HI>Flags</HI> proclaim, That they have the <HI>Fear of God</HI> within them.</P>
<P>Very particularly.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Let it be a <HI>Sen&s;ible</HI> and a <HI>Sorrowful</HI> mat|ter unto you, That &s;o many of your <HI>Sea-fa|ring Brethren,</HI> are &s;o <HI>fearfully mi&s;erable,</HI> by their wanting the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> All that have the <HI>Fear of God</HI> in them, &s;hew it by this mark; 'Tis a <HI>Grief</HI> unto them, to &s;ee others

without the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> They may all of them &s;ay with him, in P&s;al. 119.158. <HI>I beheld the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, and was grieved.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Marriners</HI> are a Generation of men, greatly Serviceable to the <HI>Common wealth.</HI> Ordinarily they are men of &s;tout and brave Spirits: They are under God, indeed the very Defence of our Nation: And we are beholden to them, for a very great part of tho&s;e Enjoyments, whereby our Lives are &s;weetened unto us. The <HI>Invaluable Benefits,</HI> by the means of our <HI>Sea faring Friends</HI> done unto us, oblige us to no little Value and Friend&s;hip for them. What a Trouble &s;hould it be, unto all that have the <HI>Fear of God</HI> in them, to &s;ee &s;uch an <HI>U&s;eful</HI> &s;ort of men, &s;o much abandoned unto all &s;ort of <HI>Sinfulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Wretchedne&s;s!</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged unto the <HI>Exceeding Prai&s;e</HI> of God; There are many <HI>Marriners,</HI> that <HI>Fear the Lord exceedingly.</HI> We can find many <HI>Seamen,</HI> that are <HI>Fir&s;t-rate Chri&s;tians,</HI> and exceed other men, for Piety, for Probity, for Charity. When our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ingled out His <HI>Di&s;ciples,</HI> He cho&s;e a company of <HI>Sailors.</HI> Truly, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, has no truer or greater <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> under Heaven, than &s;ome that &s;pend their Dayes, not upon the <HI>Earth,</HI> but upon the <HI>Sea.</HI> But can we &s;ay, <HI>They are all &s;uch.</HI> I would to God, we could.

No, No; As the P&s;almi&s;t could &s;ay, in P&s;al. 36.1. <HI>The Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the wicked &s;aith with|in my Heart, That there is no Fear of God before his Eyes:</HI> Thus, All people take notice of it, that <HI>Seamen,</HI> too many of them, too too com|monly indulge them&s;elves, in tho&s;e mi&s;carria|ges, which declare them to be de&s;titute of the <HI>Fear of God:</HI> About the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> we are told in the <HI>Word of God</HI>; (which <HI>Teacheth</HI> it:) That it is the <HI>Beginning of Wi&s;dom:</HI> A man does not Begin to be <HI>Wi&s;e,</HI> until he have the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> Now concerning <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> we read in Job 28.14. <HI>The Sea &s;aith, It is not with me.</HI> 'Tis the glo&s;s of a famous Interpre|ter upon it; <HI>Apud Nautas non &s;olet habitare Sapientia</HI>; There are few <HI>Sailors,</HI> that have real <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> in them.</P>
<P>Now, Syrs, Let the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> cau&s;e you to mourn over tho&s;e <HI>Fooli&s;h People,</HI> that want the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> and mourn over all the mi|&s;eries, to which they do by their <HI>Folly</HI> expo&s;e them&s;elves. <HI>Mourn,</HI> I &s;ay, and Lift up your mournful Cries to God, for His Grace to be Showred from on High, upon the Hearts of your Peri&s;hing <HI>Brethren.</HI></P>

right Notion of it, all the Bible over, is This: <HI>'Tis a Dread of the Divine Di&s;plea&s;ure for Sin, driving a man unto the Lord Me&s;&s;iah, for Delive|rance from this dreadful Di&s;plea&s;ure, and from all the Cau&s;es and Effects thereof.</HI> Hence, in P&s;al. 147.11.

<P>More particularly. One Caution proper for you, is This: That you be &s;ure, you don't <HI>Go out of the way,</HI> when you <HI>Go to Sea.</HI> There was a man, who would needs <HI>Go to Sea,</HI> when
<PB N="20" REF="000932_0019_0FAD930D00CE6BC0">
he had no <HI>Call</HI> to be there: But we read in Jon 1.4. <HI>The Lord &s;ent out a great Wind into the Sea, and there was a mighty Tempe&s;t in the Sea, &s;o that the Ship was like to be broken.</HI> Be|fore you <HI>Go to Sea,</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly Examine, <HI>What Call you have to Go to Sea</HI>?

Could you &s;ay, <HI>Lord, I am where thou did&s;t call me to be</HI>? Syrs, Where are your <HI>Sailing Orders?</HI></P>
<P>Truly, 'Twere much to be advi&s;ed, That the <HI>Enchantments</HI> of the <HI>Sea,</HI> may not have too &s;trong and quick a Force upon &s;ome, to make them ra&s;hly leave <HI>Good Callings,</HI> by which they might competently &s;ub&s;i&s;t a&s;hore.

<P>But then, there is another Caution, which is no more than what is Needful for you; This is, That when you <HI>Go to Sea,</HI> you don't go out with the Guilt of any <HI>Inju&s;tice</HI> upon you.

<P>And perhaps, it may not be ami&s;s to add this one Caution more, unto all the re&s;t. There are &s;ome kinds of <HI>Pa&s;&s;engers,</HI> 'tis a dangerous thing to <HI>Ship</HI> them.
