<HEAD>A PREFACE Containing Directions to CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>YOU may now hear (my dear Lambs) what other good Children have done, and re|member how they wept and prayed by them|&s;elves; how earne&s;tly they cried out for an in|tere&s;t in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: May you not read how dutiful they were to their Parents? How diligent at their Books? how ready to learn the Scripture, and their Catechi&s;ms? Can you forget wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;tions they were wont to ask? How much they feared a lye, how much they abhorred naughty company, how holy they lived, how dearly they were loved, how joyfully they died?</P>
<P>But tell me my dear Children, and tell me truly, Do you do as the&s;e Children did? Did you ever &s;ee your mi&s;erable &s;tate by Nature? Did you ever get by your &s;elf and weep for Sin, and pray for grace and pardon? Did you ever go to your Father and Mother, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ter, or Mi&s;tre&s;s, &amp; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g of them to pity you, &amp; pray for you, &amp; to teach you what you &s;hall do to be &s;aved, what you &s;hall do to get Chri&s;t, Heaven and Glory? Do&s;t thou love to be taught good things?
<PB REF="000914_0006_0FACA1C2A47557F0">
Come tell me truly, my dear Child, for I would fain do what I can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to keep thee from falling into eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;ting Fire. I would fain have one of tho&s;e little ones, which Chri&s;t will take into his arms &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> do&s;t thou &s;pend thy time? is it in play &amp; Idlene&s;s, &amp; with wicked Children? Dare you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake Gods Name in vain, or &s;wear, or tell a lye? Dare you do any thing which your Parents forbid you, &amp; neglect to do what they command you? Do you dare to run up and down upon the Lords-day? or do you keep in to read your Book, &amp; to learn what your good Parents command you? what do you &s;ay, Child? Which of the&s;e two &s;orts are you of? Let me talk a little with you, and ask you a few Que&s;tions.</P>
<P N="1">1. Were not the&s;e Children &s;weet Children, which feared God &amp; were dutiful to their Parents? Did not their Fathers &amp; Mothers, &amp; every body that fears God, love them &amp; prai&s;e them? What do you think is become of them, now they are dead and gone? Why, they are gone to Heaven, &amp; are &s;inging Hallelujahs with the Angels: they &s;ee Glorious things, and having nothing but joy &amp; plea&s;ure, they &s;hall never &s;in any more, they &s;hall never be beat any more, they &s;hall never be &s;ick, or in pain any more.</P>
<P N="2">2. And would not you have your Fathers love, your Mothers commendation; your Ma&s;ters good word? Would not you have God &amp; Chri&s;t love
<PB REF="000914_0007_0FACA1C36B560650" MS="y">
you? &amp; would not you fain go to Heaven, when you die? And live with your godly Parents in Glory, and be happy for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whither do you think tho&s;e Children go when they die, that will not do what they are bid but play the Truant, and lye, and &s;peak naughty words, and break the Sabbath? whither do &s;uch Children go do you think? why, I will tell you, they which Lie, mu&s;t to their Father the Devil into everla&s;ting burning; they which never pray, God will pour out his wrath upon them; and when they beg and pray in Hell Fire, God will not forgive them; but there they mu&s;t lie for ever.</P>
<P N="4">4. And are you willing to go to Hell to be burned with the Devil and his Angels? Would you be in the &s;ame condition as naughty Chil|dren? O Hell is a terrible place, that's wor&s;e a thou&s;and times than whipping, Gods anger is wor&s;e than your Fathers anger; and are you willing to anger God? O Child, this is mo&s;t certainly true that all that be wicked, and die &s;o, mu&s;t be turned into Hell; and if any be once there, there is no coming out again.</P>
<P N="5">5. Would you not do any thing in the world rather than be thrown into Hell Fire? Would you not do any thing in the world to get Chri&s;t, and grace and glory.</P>
<P N="6">6. Well now, what will you do? will you read this book a little, becau&s;e your good Mother will make you do it, and becau&s;e it is a little n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w

Book, but as &s;oon as ever you have done, run away to play, and never think of it?</P>
<P N="7">7 How art thou now affected, poor Child, in the Reading of this Book? Have you &s;hed ever a tear &s;ince you begun reading? Have you been by your &s;elf upon your knees; and begging that God would make you like the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Children? or are you as you u&s;e to be, as carele&s;s &amp; fooli&s;h and di&s;obedient and wicked as ever?</P>
<P N="8">8. Did you never hear of a little Child that died? &amp; if other Children die, why may not you be &s;ick &amp; die? and what will you do then, Child, if you &s;hould have no grace in your heart, and be found like other naughty Children.</P>
<P N="9">9 How do you know but that you may be the next Child that may die? and where are you then if you be not God's Child.</P>
<P N="10">10. Wilt thou tarry any longer my dear Child, before thou run into thy Chamber, &amp; beg to God to give thee a Chri&s;t for thy Soul, that thou may&s;t not be undone for ever,? Wilt thou get pre&s;ently into a corner to weep and pray? Methinks I &s;ee that pretty Lamb begin to weep, &amp; think of get|ting by him&s;elf, &amp; will as well as he can cry unto the Lord, to make them one of the&s;e little ones that go into the Kingdom of Heaven; Methinks there &s;tands a &s;weet Child, &amp; there another, that are re&s;olved for Chri&s;t &amp; for Heaven: Methinks that little Boy looks as if he had a mind to learn good thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: Methinks I hear one &s;ay, Well, I will ne|ver

tell a lye more, I will never keep any naugh|ty Boy company more, they will teach me to &s;wear, and they will &s;peak naughty words, they do not love God. I'le learn my Catechi&s;m, &amp; get my Mother to teach us to pray, and I will go to weep and cry to Chri&s;t, and will not be quiet till the Lord hath given me Grace. O that's my brave Child indeed!</P>
<P N="11">11. But will you not quickly forget your promi&s;e? are you re&s;olved by the &s;trength of Chri&s;t to be a good Child? Are you indeed? nay, but are you indeed? Con&s;ider, dear Child, God calls you to remember your Creator in the days of your youth; &amp; he takes it kindly when little ones comes to him, and loves them dearly; and godly people, e&s;pecially Parents, &amp; Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, they have no greater joy, than to &s;ee their Children walk in the way of truth.</P>
<P>Now tell me, my pretty dear Child, what will you do? &s;hall I make you a Book? &s;hall I pray for you, and entreat you? Shall your good Mother weep over you? And will not you make us all glad, by your turning quickly to the Lord? Shall Chri&s;t tell you that he will love you? And will not you love him? Will you &s;trive to be like tho&s;e Children? I am per|&s;waded, that God intends to do good to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouls of &s;ome little Children by the&s;e papers, be|cau&s;e he hath laid it &s;o much upon my heart to pray for them and over the&s;e papers, &amp; through

mercy I have already experienced, that &s;omething of this nature hath not been in vain. I &s;hall give a word of direction, and &s;o leave you.</P>
<P N="1">1. Take heed of what you know is naught; as lying, O that is a grievous fault indeed, and naughty words, and taking the Lords name in vain, and playing upon the Lords day, &amp; keep|ing bad company, and playing with ungodly Children: But if you go to School with &s;uch, tell them that God will not love them, but that the Devil will have them, if they continue to be &s;o naught.</P>
<P N="2">2. Do what your Father and Mother bids you, chearfully; and take heed of doing any thing that they forbid you.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be diligent in reading the Scripture, and learning your Catechi&s;m; and what you do not under&s;tand, to be &s;ure ask the meaning of.</P>
<P N="4">4. Think a little &s;ometimes by your &s;elf about God and Heaven, and your Soul, and what Chri&s;t came into the world for.</P>
<P N="5">5. And if you have no great mind to do thus, but had rather be at play, then think, what is it that makes me that I do not care for good things is this like one of God's dear Children? I am a|fraid I am none of God's Child, I feel, I do not love to come unto him: O! What &s;hall I do? Either I will be Gods Child or the Devils; O what &s;hall I do? I would not be the Devils Child for any thing in the World.</P>
<P N="6"><PB REF="000914_0011_0FACA1C7E6AD7D40">6. Then go to your Father or Mother, or &s;ome Good Body, and ask them what thou &s;halt do to be God's Child; and tell them that thou art afraid, and that thou can&s;t not be contented, till thou ha&s;t got the love of God.</P>
<P N="7">7. Get by thy &s;elf, into the Chamber or Gar|ret, and fall upon thy knees, and weep and mourn, and tell Chri&s;t thou art afraid that he doth not love thee, but thou would fain have his love; beg of him to give thee his Grace and pardon for thy &s;ins, and that he would make thee his Child: Tell God thou do&s;t not care who don't love thee, if God will but love thee: Say to him, Father, ha&s;t thou not a bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ing for me thy poor little Child?

Thus beg, as for your lives, and be not contented till you have an an&s;wer; and do thus every day, with as much earne&s;tne&s;s as you can, twice a day at lea&s;t.</P>

<P N="6">6. He was not only able to give a very good account of his Catechi&s;m, but he would an&s;wer &s;uch Que&s;tions as are not in the Catechi&s;m, with greater under&s;tanding than could be expected of one of his Age.</P>
<P N="7">7. He took great delight in di&s;cour&s;ing about the things of God; and when my Friend had been either praying or reading, expounding or repeating Sermons, he &s;eem|ed very attentive, and ready to receive the truths of God, and would with in|credible gravity, diligence and affection, wait till duties were ended, to the no &s;mall joy and admiration of them which ob&s;erved him.</P>
<P N="8">8. He would ask very excellent que&s;ti|ons, and di&s;cour&s;e about the condition of his Soul and Heavenly things, and &s;eemed mightily concerned what &s;hould

<P N="9">9&punc; He was greatly taken with the great kind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s of Chri&s;t in dying for &s;inners, and and would be in tears at the mention of them: and &s;eemed at a &s;trange rate to be affected with the un&s;peakable <HI>Love</HI> of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="10">10. When no body hath been &s;peaking to him, he would bur&s;t out into tears, and being asked the rea&s;on, he would &s;ay, that the very thoughts of Chri&s;ts love to &s;inners in &s;uffering for them, made him that he could not but Cry.</P>

<P N="12">12. He would be putting of Chri&s;tians upon Spiritual di&s;cour&s;e when he &s;aw them, and &s;eemed little &s;atisfied, unle&s;s they were talking of good things.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is evident, that this poor Childs thoughts were very much bu&s;ied about the things of another World, for he would of|tentimes be &s;peaking to his Bed-fellow a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

mid-night, about the matter of his Soul; and when he could not &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eep, he would take Heavenly conference to be &s;weeter than his appointed re&s;t. This was his u&s;u|al cu&s;tome, and thus he would provoke and put forward an experienced Chri&s;tian, to &s;pend waking hours in talk of God and the everla&s;ting re&s;t.</P>
<P N="14">14. Not long after this, his good Mother dyed, which went very near his heart, for he greatly honoured his Mother.</P>
<P N="15">15. After the Death of his Mother, he would often repeat &s;ome of the Promi&s;es that are made to Fatherle&s;s Children, e&s;pe|cially that in Exod. 22.22. <HI>Ye &s;hall not affect any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or the Fatherle&s;s Child; if thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in any wi&s;e, and they Cry at all unto me, I will &s;urely hear their Cry</HI>&mdash; The&s;e words he would often repeat with tears, and &s;ay, <HI>I am Fatherle&s;s and Mother|le&s;s upon Earth, yet if any wrong me, I have a Father in Heaven who will take my part; to Him I commit my &s;elf, and in Him is all my tru&s;t.</HI></P>

<HEAD>EXAMPLE VII. Of a Notorious Wicked Child, who was taken up from Begging, and admirably Convert|ed; with an account of his holy Life and joyful Death, when he was Nine years Old.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A Very poor Child, of the Pari&s;h of <HI>Newington-But<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> came begging to the door of a dear Chri&s;tian Friend of mine, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a very lamentable ca&s;e, &s;o filthy and na&s;ty, that he would even have turned ones &s;tomack to have looked on him: But it plea&s;ed God to rai&s;e in the heart of my Friend, a great pitty &amp; tenderne&s;s toward&punc; this poor Child, &s;o that in Charity he took him out of the &s;treets, who&s;e Parents were un|known, who had nothing at all in him to

commend him to any ones Charity, but his mi&s;ery. My Friend eyeing the Glory of God, and the good of the Immortal Soul of this wretched Creature, di&s;charged the Pari&s;h of the Child, and took him as his own, de&s;igning to bring him up for the Lord Chri&s;t. A Noble piece of Charity&punc; And that which did make the kindne&s;s far the greater, was, that there &s;eemed to be very little hopes of doing any good upon this Child, for he was a very Mon&s;ter of wickedne&s;s, and a thou&s;and times more mi&s;erable and vile by his Sin, than by his Poverty. He was running to Hell as &s;oon as he could go, and was old in naughti|ne&s;s when he was young in years; and one &s;hall &s;carce hear of one &s;o like the Devil in his Infancy, as this poor Child was. What Sin was there (that his age was ca|pable of) that he did not commit? What by the Corruption of his Nature, and the abominable Example of little Begger-boys, he was arrived to a &s;trange pitch of Im|piety. He would call filthy Names, take Gods Name in vain, Cur&s;e and Swear, and do almo&s;t all kind of Mi&s;chief; and as to any thing of God, wor&s;e than an Heathen.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="43" REF="000914_0055_0FACA237A528C1A0">2. But this Sin and Mi&s;ery was but a &s;tronger Motive to that Gracious man to pity him, &amp; to do all that po&s;&s;ibly he could to pluck this Fire-brand out of the Fire, &amp; it was not long before the Lord was plea&s;ed to let him under&s;tand, that He had a de&s;ign of everla&s;ting kindne&s;s upon the Soul of this poor Child; for no &s;ooner had this good Man taken this Creature into his hou&s;e, but he prays for him, and labours with all his might to convince him of his mi&s;erable condition by Nature, and to teach him &s;omething of God, the worth of his own Soul, and that Eternity of Glory or Mi&s;ery that he was born to: And Ble&s;&s;ed be Free Grace, it was not long before the Lord was plea&s;ed to let him under&s;tand, that it was Him&s;elf which put it into his heart to take in this Child, that he might bring him up for Chri&s;t. The Lord &s;oon &s;truck in with his Godly In&s;tructions, &s;o that an amazing Change was &s;een in the Child, in a few weeks &s;pace he was &s;oon convinced of the evil of his ways; no more News now of his calling of Names, Swear|ing, or Cur&s;ing; no more taking of the Lords Name in vain; now he is civil and re&s;pective; and &s;uch a &s;trange alteration

<P N="3">3. And this Change was not only an external one, and to be di&s;cerned abroad, but he would get by him&s;elf, and weep and mourn bitterly, for his horrible wicked life, as might ea&s;ily be perceived by them that lived in the hou&s;e with him.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was the great care of his Godly ma&s;ter, to &s;trike in with tho&s;e Convictions which the Lord had made, and to improve them all he could; and he was not a little glad to &s;ee that his labour was not in vain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Lord; he &s;till experiences that the Lord doth carry on his own work mighti|ly on the heart of the Child; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;till more and more broken under a &s;ence of his undone &s;tate by Nature; he is oft in tears, and bemoaning his lo&s;t and mi&s;erable Con|dition. When his Ma&s;ter did &s;peak of the things of God, he li&s;tned earne&s;tly, and took in with much greedine&s;s and affection what he was taught Seldom was there

any di&s;cour&s;e about Soul-matters in his hearing, but he heard it as if it were for his life, and would weep greatly.</P>
<P N="5">5. He would after his Ma&s;ter had been &s;peaking to him, or others, of the things of God, go to him, and que&s;tion with him about them, and beg of him to in&s;truct &amp; teach him further, and to tell him tho&s;e things again, that he might remember and under&s;tand them better.</P>
<P N="6">6. Thus he continued &s;eeking after the knowledge of God and Chri&s;t, and practi|&s;ing holy Duties, till the &s;ickne&s;s came into the hou&s;e, with which the Child was &s;mit|ten; at his fir&s;t &s;ickning, the poor Child was greatly amazed and afraid, and though his pains were great, and the di&s;temper very tedious, yet the fence of his &s;in, and the thought of the mi&s;erable condition that he feared his Soul was &s;till in, made his trouble ten times greater; he was in grievous agonies of Spirit, and his former &s;ins &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ared him in the face, and made him tremble; the poy&s;on of Gods Arrows did even drink up his Spirits; the &s;ence of Sin and Wrath was &s;o great, that he could not tell what in the world to do; the weight of Gods Di&s;plea&s;ure, and the thoughts of

<P N="7">7. But in this great Di&s;tre&s;s the Lord was plea&s;ed to &s;end one to take care fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Soul, who urged to him the great and precious Promi&s;es which were made to on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in his condition, telling him that there was enough in Chri&s;t for the Chiefe&s;t of Sinners&punc; and that He came to &s;eek and &s;ave &s;uch a lo&s;t Creature as he was. But this poor Child found it a very difficult thing for him to believe that there was any mercy for &s;uch a Dreadful Sinner as he had been</P>
<P N="8">8. He was made to Cry out of him&s;elf, not only for his Swearing and Lying, and other outwardly notorious Sins; but he was in great Horrour for the Sin of his Na|ture, for the Vilene&s;s of his Heart, and O|riginal

<P N="9">9. He did very particularly confe&s;s and bewail his &s;ins with tears; and &s;ome &s;ins &s;o &s;ecret, that none in the world could charge him with.</P>
<P N="10">10. He would Condemn him&s;elf for &s;in, as de&s;erving to have no Mercy, &amp; thought that there was not a greater Sinner in all <HI>London</HI> than him&s;elf, and he abhorred him&s;elf as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he vile&s;t creature he knew.</P>
<P N="11">11. He did not only pray much with &s;trong Cryes and Tears him&s;elf, but he begged the prayers of Chri&s;tians for him.</P>
<P N="12">12. He would ask Chri&s;tians, whether they thought there were any hopes for him, and would beg of them to deal plainly with him, for he was greatly afraid of being d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ceived.</P>
<P N="13">13. Being informed how willing and ready the Lord Chri&s;t was to accept of poor Sinners, upon their Repentance and Turning, and being coun&s;elled to venture him&s;elf upon Chri&s;t, for Mercy and Salva|tion, he &s;aid he would fain ca&s;t him&s;elf up|on

<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="example">
<HEAD>EXAMPLE VIII. Of a Child that was very Serious at Four Years Old, with an Account of his Comfortable Death, when he was Twelve Years and Three Weeks Old.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>JOhn Sudlow,</HI> was Born of Religious Parents, in the County of <HI>Middle|&s;ex,</HI> who&s;e great care was to in&s;til Spiritual Principles into him, as &s;oon as he was capable of under&s;tanding of them;
<PB N="62" REF="000914_0072_0FACA245262E79A0">
who&s;e Endeavours the Lord was plea&s;ed to Crown with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s: So that (to u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion of a Holy Man con|cerning him) <HI>Scarce more could be expected or de&s;ired from &s;o little a one.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. When he was &s;carce able to &s;peak plain, he &s;eemed to have a very great awe and reverence of God upon his Spirit, and a &s;trange &s;ence of the things of another world, as might ea&s;ily be perceived by tho&s;e &s;erious and admirable que&s;tions which he would be oft asking of tho&s;e Chri&s;tians that he thought he might be bold with.</P>
<P N="3">3. The fir&s;t thing that did mo&s;t affect him, and made him endeavour to e&s;cape from the wrath to come, and to enquire what he &s;hould do to be Saved, was the Death of a little Brother; when he &s;aw him without breath, and not able to &s;tir, and then carried out of doors, and put in|to a Pit-hole, he was greatly concerned, and asked notable que&s;tions about him; but that which was mo&s;t affecting of him|&s;elf and others, was, <HI>Whether he must Dye too,</HI> which being an&s;wered, it made &s;uch a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon him, that from that time forward, he was exceeding Seri|ous, &amp; this was when he was about four Years old.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="63" REF="000914_0073_0FACA245E6C92360">4. Now he is de&s;irous to know what he might do that he might live in another World, and what he mu&s;t avoid, that he might not Dye for ever, and being in|&s;tructed by his Godly Parents, he &s;oon la|bours to avoid what&s;oever might di&s;plea&s;e God; now tell him that any thing was Sinful, and that God would not have him to do it, and he is ea&s;ily kept from it, and even at this time of day, the apprehen&s;ions of God, and Death and Eternity laid &s;uch a re&s;traint upon him, that he would not for a World have told a lye.</P>
<P N="5">5. He quickly learned to read exactly, and took &s;uch plea&s;ure in reading of the Scriptures and his Catechi&s;m, and other good Books, that it is &s;carce to be parallell'd; he would naturally run to his Book with|out bidding, when he came home from School, and when other Children of his age and acquaintance were playing, he reckon'd it his Recreation to be doing that which was good.</P>
<P N="6">6. When he was in Coats, he would be &s;till asking his Maid &s;erious que&s;tions, and praying her to teach him his Cate|chi&s;m, or Scriptures, or &s;ome good thing; common Di&s;cour&s;e he took no delight in,
<PB N="64" REF="000914_0074_0FACA246AD4F5D80">
but did mo&s;t eagerly de&s;ire to be &s;ucking in of the knowledge of the things of God, Chri&s;t, his Soul, and another World.</P>
<P N="7">7. He was lingely taken with the read|ing of the Book of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> and would be ready to leave his Dinner to go to his Book.</P>
<P N="8">8. He was exceeding careful of redeem|ing and improving of Time; &s;carce a mo|ment of it, but he would give an excellent account of the expence of it; &s;o that this Child might have taught elder Per&s;ons, and will que&s;tionle&s;s Condemn their idle and unaccountable wa&s;ting of tho&s;e Precious hours in which they &s;hould (as this &s;weet Child&punc;) have been laying in provi&s;ion for Eternity.</P>
<P N="9">9. He could not endure to read any thing over &s;lightly, but what&s;oever he read, he dwelt upon it, laboured to under&s;tand it throughly, and remember it; and what he could not under&s;tand, he would oft ask his Father or Mother the meaning of it.</P>
<P N="10">10. When any Chri&s;tian Friends have been di&s;cour&s;ing with his Father, if they began to talk any thing about Religion, to be &s;ure they &s;hould have his company,
<PB N="65" REF="000914_0075_0FACA247617B3A60">
and of his own accord, he would leave all to hear any thing of Chri&s;t, and crept as clo&s;e to them as he could, and li&s;ten as af|fectionately though it were for an hour or two: He was &s;carce ever known to ex|pre&s;s the lea&s;t token of wearine&s;s while he was hearing any thing that was good, and &s;ometimes, when Neighbours Children would come and call him out, and entice him, and beg of him to go with them, he could by no means be per&s;waded, though he might have had the leave of his Parents, if he had any hopes that any good Body would come into his Fathers Hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="11">11. He was very mode&s;t while&s;t any &s;tranger was pre&s;ent, and was loth to ask them any que&s;tions: but as &s;oon as they were gone, he would let his Father know that there was little &s;aid or done, but he ob&s;erved it, and would reflect upon what was pa&s;t in their di&s;cour&s;e, and de&s;ire &s;a|tisfaction in what he could not under&s;tand at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="12">12. He was a Boy of almo&s;t prodigious parts for his age, as will appear for his &s;olid and rational que&s;tions; I &s;hall but mention but two of many.</P>
<P N="13">13. The fir&s;t was this, when he was
<PB N="66" REF="000914_0076_0FACA248220BA320">
reading by him&s;elf, in <HI>Dra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ton</HI>'s Poems a|bout <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood and the Ark, he asked, <HI>Who Built the Ark?</HI> It being an&s;wered, that it was likely that <HI>Noah</HI> hired men to help him to Build it: <HI>And would they (&s;aid he) Build an Ark to Save another, and not go into it them&s;elves?</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. Another que&s;tion he put was this&punc; <HI>Whether had a greater Glory, Saints or Angels&punc;</HI> It being an&s;wered, that Angels were the mo&s;t Excellent of Creatures, and it's to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thought, their Nature is made capable o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> greater Glory than Mans. <HI>He &s;aid, he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of another mind, and his rea&s;on was, becau&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Angels was Servants, and Saints are Children&punc; and that Chri&s;t never took upon him the Na|ture of Angels, but he took upon him the Na|ture of Saints, and by his being MAN, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hath advanced humane Nature above the Na|ture of Angels.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. By this you may perceive the great|ne&s;s of his parts, and the bent of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thoughts; and thus he continued for &s;e|veral Years together, labouring to ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more and more Spiritual knowledge, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prepare for an endle&s;s Life.</P>
<P N="16">16. He was a Child of an excellent &s;weet Temper, wonderfully Dutiful to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

Parents, ready and joyful to do what he was bid, and by no means would do any thing to di&s;plea&s;e them, and if they were at any time &s;eemingly angry, he would not &s;tir from them till they were thorowly reconciled to him.</P>
<P N="17">17. He was not only good him&s;elf, but would do what he could to make o|thers &s;o too, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that were neare&s;t to him; he was very watchful over his Brethren and Si&s;ters, and would not &s;uffer them to u&s;e any unhand&s;ome words, or to do any unhand&s;ome action, but he would be putting them upon that which was good, and when he did at any time rebuke them, it was not Childi&s;hly and Slightly, but with great Gravity and Seriou&s;ne&s;s, as one that was not a little concerned for Gods Honour, &amp; the Eternal welfare of their Souls.</P>
<P N="18">18. He would go to his Father and Mother with great tenderne&s;s &amp; compa&s;&s;i|on, (being far from telling of Tales) and beg of them, to take more care of the Souls of his Brethren and Si&s;ters, and to take heed le&s;t they &s;hould go on in a Sinful Chri&s;tle&s;s &s;tate, and prove their &s;orrow and &s;hame, and go to Hell when they dye, &amp; he r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined for ever.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="68" REF="000914_0078_0FACA249A2A308F0">19. He was exceedingly affected with hearing of the Word of God Preached, and could not be &s;atisfied, except he could carry home much of the &s;ub&s;tance of what he heard; to this end he quickly got to learn Short-hand, and would give a very pretty account of any Sermon that he heard.</P>
<P N="20">20. He was much engaged in &s;ecret duty, and in reading the Scriptures; to be &s;ure morning and evening he would be by him&s;elf, &amp; was no que&s;tion, wre&s;tling with God.</P>
<P N="21">21. He would get choice Scriptures by heart, and was very perfect at his Cate|chi&s;m.</P>
<P N="22">22. The Providences of God were not pa&s;&s;ed by, without con&s;iderable ob&s;ervation by him.</P>
<P N="23">23. In the time of the Plague, he was exceedingly concerned about his Soul and Everla&s;ting &s;tate; very much by him&s;elf upon his knees.</P>
<P>This Prayer was found written in Short|hand after his Death.</P>
