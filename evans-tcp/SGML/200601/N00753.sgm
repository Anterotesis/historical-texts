<HEAD>His Excellency, The Earl of BELLOMONT'S SPEECH TO THE Honorable the COUNCIL and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, Conven'd in General A&s;&s;embly, at <HI>Boston,</HI> in His Maje&s;ties Province of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 29. of <HI>May</HI> 1700.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT I propos'd la&s;t <HI>May's</HI> Se&s;&s;ion for the advantage of the Province in relation to the Settlement of the <HI>Colledge,</HI> and Fortifying this Harbour, was &s;o coldly entertain'd by the A&s;&s;embly, That I am almo&s;t di&s;courag'd from renewing my Advice on tho&s;e heads. Yet my zeal for the Publick Service will not &s;uffer me to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence tho&s;e two material points. The Settlement of the <HI>Colledge</HI> will be&s;t be obtain'd in my opinion by Addre&s;s|ing the KING for His Royal Charter of Priviledges. And as for Fortifying the Harbour, that is in your own power to do, and will I am per&s;waded be plea&s;ing to the KING, who de&s;ires, and delights in, the welfare and &s;ecurity of His people.</P>
<P>I am told many of your Mini&s;ters in the remote parts of the Province, have very narrow Stipends, not enough to maintain 'em Decently; 'tis rea&s;onable you &s;hould make them ea&s;y: with them I recommend to your care the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ter of this Town, who is de&s;titute of a Maintenance, becau&s;e there are &s;o very few <HI>French</HI> Families here: Let the pre&s;ent raging per&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tants in <HI>France,</HI> &s;tir up your Zeal and Compa&s;&s;ion towards him. I wi&s;h for your &s;akes the <HI>French</HI> Prote&s;tants had been incourag'd among you, they are a good &s;ort of People, very Ingenious and Indu&s;trious, and would have been of great u&s;e for Peopling this Country, and enriching it by Trade.</P>
<P>You know as well as I the Circum&s;tances we are in with the Ea&s;tern <HI>Indians,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries have debauch'd 'em from their former Obedience to the KING, and that it was at their In&s;tigation they Murder'd &s;o many of your People this la&s;t War; and are now at the Devotion of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> to act over again &s;uch another Tragedy. It &s;eems to me that the Suffering <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> or other Popi&s;h Mi&s;&s;ionaries to live in this Province, and poy&s;on the <HI>Indians</HI> with their gro&s;s Idolatry and Super&s;tition is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> Laws and Government; I and wi&s;h you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> delay, make a L<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">w for Puni&s;hing &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;hall at any time pre&s;ume to come <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000907_0002_0FACA05920CD6E30">I am &s;orry to tell you, That I find the <HI>French</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries are no le&s;s In|du&s;trious to debauch our five Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> in the Province of <HI>New York,</HI> taking Indefatigable pains to work on &s;ome by fear and menaces, on others by Enticement and Flattery; and the Me&s;&s;engers I lately &s;ent to Encou|rage them, Inform me that &s;everal of our forward Fighting Indians that were be&s;t affected to us, have lately been di&s;patch'd out of the world by poy&s;on. The parting with <HI>Canada</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI> and the Ea&s;tern Country call'd <HI>Acadie</HI> or <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> with the noble Fi&s;hery on that Coa&s;t, were a mo&s;t execrable Treachery to <HI>England,</HI> and intended without doubt to &s;erve the ends of Popery. 'Tis too well known what Intere&s;t that King favour'd, that parted with <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> and of what Religion he died. I have now in my hands his Original Order to the Governour of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> to Sur|render that Country to the <HI>French,</HI> and 'tis ob&s;ervable the Secretary of State that Counter-&s;ign'd the Order, afterwards died a Papi&s;t. Such fatal Mi&s;government in the late Reigns, ought to give us the highe&s;t Venerati|on and value for his Pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, who is in all re&s;pects a true Pro|te&s;tant KING, both in the watchful and Indulgent Care of His Prote&s;tant Subjects, and his great moderation to others.</P>
<P>I am Commanded by the KING to Recommend to you the pa&s;&s;ing a Law to prevent the E&s;cape of Pyrates and other Offenders out of Pri&s;on, and to puni&s;h the Keepers of Pri&s;ons within this Province, and all other per&s;ons that &s;hall be con&s;enting to or a&s;&s;i&s;ting in &s;uch E&s;capes.</P>
<P>You would do well to make a Law that &s;hall effectually prevent the Clipping and Deba&s;ing the Current Coin&punc; and al&s;o the Exportation there|of, both which are become too univer&s;al a practice, and tend very much to the Impoveri&s;hment of the Province.</P>
<P>The Management of the Ea&s;tern Indians in &s;uch manner as to bring them again under the Obedience of His Maje&s;ty is nece&s;&s;ary above all other things, and worth your thoughts and care to try to effect.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</P>
<P>It will become you to take Care for the Support of the Government, and to provide &s;uch Supplies as may be&s;t &s;uit with the Ea&s;e and Con|venience of the people, to you therefore I more particularly Recommend that Service.</P>
