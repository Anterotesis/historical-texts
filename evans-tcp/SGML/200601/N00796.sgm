</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> was imployed in delivering God's me&s;&s;ages to his pro|fe&s;&s;ing people the Jews, when they were chargeable with great degene|racies, with many and gro&s;s &s;ins; &s;ome of which are mentioned in the 6, 8, 9 <HI>ver&s;es</HI> of the preceeding Chapter, as well as in &s;undry o|ther places. For the&s;e &s;ins, God by his Prophet threatens them, with various and terrible Judg|ments. In the fir&s;t ver&s;e of this Chapter he threatens them with Famine: <HI>he would take a|way the Stay, and the &s;taff, the whole &s;tay of
<PB N="4" REF="000958_0003_0FADE3EA9835E428">
Bread, and the whole &s;tay of water.</HI> In the &s;e|cond ver&s;e (containing our <HI>Text</HI>) God threat|ens to take away their men of chief Note, that were mo&s;t Eminent, U&s;eful and Serviceable in their <HI>Military,</HI> their <HI>Civil,</HI> and <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Af|fairs. Our Text refers to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, their men that were mo&s;t Eminent, U&s;eful and Ser|viceable in <HI>Military</HI> Affairs, the <HI>Mighty man,</HI> and the <HI>Man of War</HI>; their valiant able <HI>Warri|ours,</HI> the&s;e God threatens to take away from them in Judgment. From whence we may ob&s;erve this Doctrine.</P>
<Q>That Valiant, Able Warriours among Gods People, are ju&s;tly accounted a great Ble&s;&s;ing to them.</Q>
<P>This is very plain, otherwi&s;e the taking a|way of &s;uch men, would not be threatned as a Judgment, Cur&s;e, or Puni&s;hment. <HI>War</HI> con&s;i|dered meerly and ab&s;olutely in it &s;elf, is not good, nor &s;hould it be de&s;ired by any man. No War was ever begun or carried on, with &s;ufficient rea&s;ons and ju&s;t grounds on both &s;ides. Either the <HI>A&s;&s;ailant</HI> or <HI>Defendant,</HI> &s;urely &s;ins; one party &s;urely &s;ins, and both commonly &s;uf|fer. War therefore con&s;idered meerly in its &s;elf&punc; cannot lawfully be de&s;ired; for in de&s;iring of it, we de&s;ire the &s;in and mi&s;ery of &s;ome or other, neither of which is lawful in it &s;elf. Tho' tis thus, yet in &s;ome ca&s;es, <HI>War</HI> is not only
<PB N="5" REF="000958_0004_0FADE3EBB0944B68">
lawful, but al&s;o commendable, yea a nece&s;&s;ary duty. Before I &s;peak directly to the Doctrine, I &s;hall endeavour a brief An&s;wer to the&s;e two Inquiries, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>To whom does it belong to make War?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>What are the ju&s;t cau&s;es of War?</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Que&s;t. 1. <HI>To whom does it belong to make War?</HI></P>
<P>For An&s;wer, <HI>It belongs to the Chief Supream Authority, ju&s;tly Establi&s;hed over a people, to make War.</HI> For the Supream Authority, is to defend the Subjects in their <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Priviledges,</HI> and to revenge the gro&s;s wrongs done to them by Enemies. It &s;eems ju&s;t and rea&s;onable al&s;o, that the Supream Authority may delegate or com|municate power, to far di&s;tant <HI>Provinces</HI> or <HI>Plantations</HI> under them, to make War in &s;uch and &s;uch ca&s;es, under &s;uch and &s;uch limitations, as the matter may be circum&s;tanced. Notwith|&s;tanding what has been &s;aid, it &s;eems ju&s;tifya|ble for the &s;malle&s;t part or handful of any Nation, (tho' they have no direct Order or Commi&s;&s;ion, from the Supream or Subordinate Authority over them) to make a defen&s;ive War, when they are unju&s;tly and &s;uddenly a&s;|&s;aulted by cruel Enemies; but 'tis no way al|lowable for private unauthorized per&s;ons to make an offen&s;ive War. If upon Spoils or Robberies done by &s;ome of a Neighbouring Nation, private per&s;ons &s;hould, without Order or Commi&s;&s;ion from Authority, go and make
<PB N="6" REF="000958_0005_0FADE3EC2E8FB550">
War upon that Nation, they would &s;in great+ly. Such a cour&s;e as this would be likely, to Embroil Nations in continual Wars, Uproars and Confu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 2. <HI>What are the ju&s;t cau&s;es of making War?</HI></P>
<P><HI>For An&s;wer,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e the mo&s;t of them may be comprehended under the&s;e three gene|ral heads. Either,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Defence, or &s;elf pre&s;ervation from the unju&s;t a&s;&s;aults of others.</HI> A Peoples fighting for the de|fence of their <HI>Per&s;ons, Liberties</HI> and <HI>Properties,</HI> &s;eems altogether rea&s;onable, having nothing to be &s;aid again&s;t it. Self-pre&s;ervation, is a prin|ciple implanted in all men, as well as other A|nimals, and that by God him&s;elf. 'Tis al&s;o lawful for a people to make, or help in, a de|fen&s;ive War, when their <HI>Allies</HI> or <HI>Confederates</HI> are unju&s;tly a&s;&s;aulted and mole&s;ted: thus <HI>Jo|&s;hua</HI> and the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> being in <HI>League</HI> or Con|federacy with the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> came to fight for them again&s;t their Enemies, <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 10.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Another ju&s;t cau&s;e of War is, Recovery of great damages.</HI> When <HI>Ziklag</HI> was taken and ran&s;acked, and the Wives, Children, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of <HI>David</HI> and his men were taken away by the <HI>Amalekites; David</HI> and his men made War upon them, for the recovery of tho&s;e damage<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, and did recover all. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 30. <HI>Ch.</HI> When <HI>Lot</HI> was taken Captive, and his Goods made a prey,
<PB N="7" REF="000958_0006_0FADE3ECD19E9308">
<HI>Abraham,</HI> his <HI>Allie</HI> and Friend made War upon the <HI>Aggre&s;&s;ors</HI> or <HI>A&s;&s;ailants</HI> for the Recovery of damages, and did deliver <HI>Lot,</HI> and re&s;cue his Goods. <HI>Gen.</HI> 14. I &s;uppo&s;e under this Head, may be comprehended the unju&s;t <HI>revolt of Sub|jects,</HI> and <HI>falling off of Tributaries</HI>; for the gro&s;s default of &s;uch, it &s;eems Ju&s;tifyable to make War upon them, to reduce them to their for|mer ju&s;t order, duty and obedience.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Another ju&s;t cau&s;e of War may be, the reven|ging of Injuries.</HI> Though the ca&s;e may be &s;o circum&s;tanced, that there's no po&s;&s;ibility of re|covering damages, or repairing the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tain|ed, yet it may be not only lawful, but al&s;o a duty to revenge Injuries. Thus if our Heathen Neighbours &s;hould &s;uddenly burn any of our <HI>Frontier Towns,</HI> &amp; de&s;troy the Inhabitants there|of, it would then be our duty, were it in our power, to revenge that Injury in the death of all the <HI>Actors</HI> in, and <HI>Abettors</HI> of, &s;uch Murder, although we could not po&s;&s;ibly recover dama|ges, or pay our &s;elves for the Goods unju&s;tly de&s;troyed, or taken away. Having briefly premi&s;ed the&s;e things concerning War, which po&s;&s;ibly are not wholly forreign to our pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, we may now proceed to the <HI>Doctrine</HI> it &s;elf:
<Q>That valiant able Warriours among Gods People, are ju&s;tly accounted a great Ble&s;&s;ing to them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="000958_0007_0FADE3EDAAFDF758">Here it &s;eems very natural to rai&s;e the&s;e two Enquiries: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Who are to be accounted valiant, able, Warri|ours? Or when may per&s;ons be ju&s;tly &s;o termed?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>How does it appear that &s;uch per&s;ons among Gods people, are ju&s;tly to be accounted a great Ble&s;|&s;ing to them?</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t. 1. <HI>Who are to be accounted valiant&punc; able Warriours? Or when may per&s;ons be ju&s;tly &s;o termed?</HI> In order to an An&s;wer, we may note, That Souldiers as &s;uch, are In&s;truments: that the goodne&s;s of In&s;truments is to be judged of bv their fitne&s;s or &s;uitablene&s;s to obtain the end, whereunto they are de&s;igned. The An&s;wer to the &s;econd of the premi&s;ed Que&s;tions, about the ju&s;t cau&s;es of War, tells us, that the end of Souldiers as &s;uch, or the u&s;e they are to be put to, is, to <HI>defend, recover</HI> damages, and <HI>revenge Injuries.</HI> Now the more fit Souldiers are for the&s;e Services, &s;o much the more valiant and able they are to be accounted. Note al&s;o, Souldiers are either <HI>Rulers,</HI> or <HI>Ruled, Comman|ders,</HI> or <HI>Private Souldiers.</HI> Now fir&s;t,</P>
<P N="1">1. As to <HI>Private Souldiers,</HI> they may be &s;aid to be valiant and able, when they have the&s;e following Qualifications. Namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When they are &s;trong and able of Body to go through hard, difficult Services.</HI> Men are not fit for Souldiers, unle&s;s they are &s;it to endure <HI>hard|ne&s;s,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2 3. Souldiers are often call'd to
<PB N="9" REF="000958_0008_0FADE3F02E782228">
Encounter with Storms and Tempe&s;ts, wet &amp; dry, hot and cold, with hunger and thir&s;t: they are &s;ometimes called to frequent Watch|ings, long marches, to pa&s;s Hills and Dales, craggy Mountains, and deep Rivers, &s;uddenly to Intrench, to build Forts, to &s;cale Walls, and other &s;uch like Services, which contain more difficulty in them, than can be ea&s;ily conceived of. Men had need have &s;trong hardy Bodies, to undergo &s;uch <HI>Fatigues.</HI> Softne&s;s &amp; delicacy does not become Souldiers, 'tis a di&s;grace to a Camp. The Souldiers of <HI>Alexander</HI> in a fit of di&s;content, complained that they were forced to <HI>Fight not only against multitudes of Enemies, but al&s;o against Mountains and Rivers. Ateas the Scythian King</HI> gave a great Commend of his Souldiers, when he &s;aid to <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Mace|don, Your Souldiers can fight with men, but mine can fight with hunger, thir&s;t, and &s;uch like difficul|ties.</HI> Souldiers therefore &s;hould &s;hun all In|temperance. <HI>Every man that &s;triveth for the mastery, is temperate in all things.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.25. <HI>Scipio</HI> wept when he came into the Camp, and &s;aw the <HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, Luxury and Intemperance there prevailing.</HI> When <HI>Alexander</HI> had Conque|red Kingdoms by his <HI>Grecian</HI> hardine&s;s, he was him&s;elf Conquered by <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Softne&s;s and De+bauchery.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When they have valorous couragious &s;pirits.</HI> When they have hearts big enough to attempt
<PB N="10" REF="000958_0009_0FADE3F147B80748">
hazardous things, to give a bold and vigorous (though dangerous) <HI>repul&s;e</HI> or <HI>on&s;et.</HI> A Souldi|ers &s;trength of body wont &s;ignifie much, unle&s;s he has courage of mind to manage it: without courage, his &s;trength is almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s in War, unle&s;s it be like an <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> or a <HI>Camel</HI> to bear and carry burdens. When the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were going to War again&s;t their enemies, the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> were to &s;ay unto them, <HI>Let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrifyed be|cau&s;e of them,</HI> Deut. 20.3. And why &s;hould not Gods Prie&s;ts or Mini&s;ters, &s;o incourage Souldiers now?

Men dont de&s;erve the honourable title of Souldiers, if they have not the re&s;olute Spirit of Souldiers.

how to u&s;e it, &s;eems as idle and fooli&s;h, as for a Child to boa&s;t of a Book, which he cannot read a word in. Souldiers &s;hould al&s;o know the words of Command, that they may readily ap|prehend the mind of their Commanders in them, and &s;peedily yield obedience thereunto. So &s;hould they under&s;tand the <HI>beat of the Drum,</HI> and the <HI>&s;ound of the Trumpet</HI>: otherwi&s;e they can't di&s;tingui&s;h between a <HI>Charge</HI> and a <HI>Retreat,</HI> and then what follows, but confu&s;ion in&s;tead of order, and overthrow in&s;tead of victory? If the&s;e things are not under&s;tood, who &s;hall pre|pare him&s;elf for the battel, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.7, 8. Tho&s;e were highly commended that were <HI>expert</HI> in War, <HI>that had all manner of Instruments of War for the battel, and were men that could keep rank,</HI> 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12.33, 37, 38. They were well train'd and di&s;ciplin'd.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>When they are obedient to their Commander.</HI> 'Twas the commendation of tho&s;e Souldiers, <HI>Matth.</HI> 8.9. <HI>That they went and came, at their Commanders bidding.</HI> And truely without this qualification, Souldiers don't de&s;erve to be com|mended: 'tis not their bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;pute and capitulate <HI>with,</HI> but yield obedience <HI>to,</HI> their Of|ficers. When <HI>Roman</HI> Souldiers were <HI>Pre&s;&s;ed,</HI> each took his Oath, not to for&s;ake his <HI>Captain</HI> or <HI>Country,</HI> which Oath was called, <HI>Sacramentum Militare. Obtemperaturas &s;um et facturus quicquid mandabitur ab Impreratoribus, juxta vires</HI>; to the
<PB N="12" REF="000958_0011_0FADE3F2D7218240">
utmo&s;t of my power, I will obey thy Command|er in all things. <HI>Cyrus</HI> was wont to &s;ay, <HI>'Tis better for a Souldier to fear his Captain, than his enemies. Paulus Aemylius</HI> would &s;ay, a Souldier &s;hould take care of three things, <HI>That he has a &s;trong body good arms,</HI> and a <HI>mind ready to obey.</HI> When a Souldier was once ju&s;t ready to &s;mite his enemy with his Sword, he forbore upon the Sounding of a <HI>Retreat,</HI> and being asked by one, why he &s;uffered his enemy to e&s;cape, he an&s;|wered, <HI>'Twas better to obey his Emperor, than &s;lay his Enemy.</HI> He's not a good Souldier, that knows not how to obey his Commander. I &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e who have the&s;e forementioned qualifi|cations, may well pa&s;s for valiant, able Souldiers.</P>
<P>We may further note, that the more <HI>Pious</HI> per&s;ons be, &s;o much the better Souldiers they commonly are. Tho&s;e who will Cur&s;e and Swear, as though they would Damn their ene|mies into Hell, are &s;ometimes backward enough to look an enemy in the face, much more to &s;mite him to the ground. <HI>Iphicrates</HI> &s;pake like a bruti&s;h Heathen, when he &s;aid, <HI>A Souldier ought to be coveteous of riches and plea&s;ures that he may the more boldly incounter dangers for the &s;atisfying of his lu&s;ts</HI>: It better becomes Chri&s;tians to &s;ay, <HI>Souldi|ers &s;hould be pious and gracious, that &s;o they may the more boldly incounter dangers for the an&s;wer of a good Con&s;cience.</HI> Never were there better, bolder, and more couragious Souldiers in the world, than
<PB N="13" REF="000958_0012_0FADE3F3A04BFD78">
&s;ome of the holie&s;t of men have been. 'Tis mentioned as an eminent commendable effect of <HI>Faith</HI> in &s;ome, <HI>That they waxed valiant in fight, and turned to flight the armies of the Aliens, Heb.</HI> 11.34. As <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Tears</HI> are the weapons of the Church, &s;o men mo&s;t expert at tho&s;e wea|pons are mo&s;t commonly the be&s;t Souldiers.</P>
<P>Having &s;poke the&s;e few things of <HI>private Souldiers,</HI> we may now proceed to the other part of the di&s;tribution, <HI>viz Officers</HI> or <HI>Commanders,</HI> among whom there are various orders or de|grees one above another: yet excepting the Chief Supream Commander, who as &s;uch, is not to receive &amp; obey, but to give out <HI>Commands,</HI> unto his army; I &s;uppo&s;e they are all the more worthy to be accounted valiant, able Souldiers, by how much the more they have, of all the forementioned qualifications. If their hardy bodies will indure uncomfortable lodgings, mean diet, wet &amp; dry, heat &amp; cold, tedious marches, and great fatigues, this might animate their Souldiers to do &s;o too. Commanders &s;hould have &s;ingular Courage al&s;o, according to the Station they are in, they &s;hould have enough for them&s;elves, and &s;ome to &s;pare to their Souldiers too; that is by way of Ex|ample and Exhortation. We mu&s;t not look for great Exploits to be done by that Com|pany that has a cowardly Captain. A faint hearted <HI>Leader,</HI> will rather encourage the
<PB N="14" REF="000958_0013_0FADE3F45FFA3FB0">
feet of his Souldiers to flee, than their hearts or hands to fight. They &s;hould have good Skill likewi&s;e. 'Tis to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that every Officer according to his place, be it high or low; is able to In&s;truct all under him, in their duty, otherwi&s;e how can he give proper words of Command, or puni&s;h Offenders for not obey|ing them? You know what is like to become of blind guides and their followers. As for the Obedience of Inferiour Officers, to tho&s;e that are Superiour; 'tis as needful and commenda|ble, as the Obedience of any Private Souldiers. Be&s;ides the&s;e Qualifications, it &s;eems very de&s;i|rable, that Commanders, e&s;pecially the chief of them &s;hould be,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Men of great Prudence and Conduct.</HI> Great Prudence and Conduct is needful for the orde|ring of Marches, e&s;pecially through difficult pa&s;&s;ages, for the ordering of <HI>Scouts</HI> to di&s;cover <HI>Ambu&s;hments,</HI> and prevent &s;udden Surprizal, for Entrenching and Fortifying in commodi|ous places, for &s;ecuring of <HI>Stores,</HI> for choo&s;ing time and place for battle, and &s;uch like things of great weight.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Men well acquainted with their Souldiers, and Under Officers.</HI> This is needful, that &s;o they may chu&s;e and order, for &s;uch and &s;uch Services, men that are mo&s;t proper for the &s;ame. <HI>Joab</HI> cho&s;e the <HI>choice men of I&s;rael for the mo&s;t difficult Service,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10.9. This he

could not have done, but that he knew his Army well.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Men of great Sagacity, Circum&s;pection, Watchfulne&s;s and Diligence.</HI> Men that will have not only a careful watchful eye, over all the Affairs of their own Army, but &s;uch as will u&s;e all proper means to get Intelligence, about the <HI>Number, Skill, Courage, Preparation, De&s;igns,</HI> &amp; <HI>Motions</HI> of the Enemy. The knowledge of the&s;e things, gives great advantage on many accounts.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Men of great patience.</HI> Souldiers often meet with &s;uch hard lodging, hard fare, with &s;uch lo&s;&s;es, di&s;appointments and difficulties, that they &s;ometimes begin to murmur again&s;t, and find fault with, their Officers, and all their ma|nagements&punc; tho' never &s;o prudent. Thus <HI>Davids</HI> men murmured again&s;t him, and talked of &s;to|ning him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 30.6.
