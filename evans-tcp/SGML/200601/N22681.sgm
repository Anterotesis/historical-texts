<HEAD>THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, HELD AT PHILADELPHIA, FOR PROMOTING USEFUL KNOWLEDGE,</HEAD>
<P><HI>IN order the more effectually to answer the ends of their institution, have agreed to appropriate, annually, a part of their funds to be disposed of in Premiums to the Authors of the best performances, inventions, or improvements, relative to certain specific subjects of useful knowledge. The following premiums, therefore, are now proposed by the Society.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="premium">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>For the best system of liberal education and literary instruction, adapted to the genius of the government, and best calculated to promote the general welfare, of the United States; comprehending also a plan for instituting and conducting public schools, in this country, on principles of the most extensive utility&mdash;<HI>A premium of one hundred dollars.</HI></P>
<P>Papers on this subject will be received, till the first day of January, 1797.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="premium">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>For the most simple, easy and expeditious method of computing the longitude, from the common lunar observation,&mdash;<HI>A premium of seventy dollars.</HI></P>
<P>The particular view of the society, in proposing this subject, is, that the solution of this most useful problem may, if possible, be rendered so plain and easy, as to be readily learned by every mariner, even of moderate capacity, who understands the common rules of arithmetic; and thus be introduced into general practice.</P>
<P>Papers on this subject will be received, till the first day of January, 1797.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="premium">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>For the best construction or improvement of ship-pumps,&mdash;<HI>A premium of seventy dollars.</HI></P>
<P>Improvements which may be readily applied to the ship-pumps in common use, will be most likely to be adopted by seamen, and introduced into general practice.</P>
<P>Papers on this subject will be received, till the first day of January, 1797.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="premium">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>For the best construction or improvement of stoves, or fire-places,&mdash;<HI>A premium of sixty dollars.</HI> The principal end which the society have in view, in proposing this subject, is the benefit of the poorer class of people, especially of such as live in towns, or other places where fuel is dear. To answer this end, the stove should be cheap, and of durable mate|rials; should afford the necessary degree of a salubrious and durable heat, with the least ex|pence of fuel possible; and should be capable of being employed both for the purpose of warming the room, and cooking provisions for the family.&mdash;The society have been informed, that stoves made of brick are, in many respects, superior to those made of metal; especially, in the saving of fuel, and preserving a more equable degree of heat.</P>
<P>Papers on this subject will be received, till the first day of January, 1797.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="premium">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P>For the best method, verified by experiment, of preventing the premature decay of Peach-trees,&mdash;<HI>A premium of sixty dollars.</HI></P>

But no member shall carry home with him the communication, description or model, except the officer to whom it shall be entrusted: nor shall such officer part with the same out of his custody, without a special order of the Society for that purpose.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The society having previously referred the several communications, from candi|dates for the premium then depending, to the consideration of the twelve counsellors and other officers of the society, and having received their report thereon, shall, at one of their stated meetings, in the month of December, annually, after the expiration of this current year (of the time and place, together with the particular occasion of which meeting, due notice shall be previously given, by public advertisement) proceed to the final adjudication of the said premium: and after due consideration had, a vote shall first be taken on this question, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "Whether any of the communications, then under inspection, be worthy of the pro|posed premium?" If this question be determined in the <HI>negative,</HI> the whole business shall be deferred till another year: But if in the <HI>affirmative,</HI> the society shall proceed to determine, by ballot, given by the members at large, the discovery, invention or im|provement most useful and worthy. And that discovery, invention or improvement which shall be found to have a majority of concurring votes in its favour, shall be successful. And then, <HI>and not till then,</HI> the sealed letter accompanying the crowned per|formance, shall be opened and the name of the author announced as the person entitled to the said premium.</P>
<P N="7">VII. No member of the society who is a candidate for the premium then depending, or who hath not previously declared to the society, either by word or writing, that he has considered and weighed, according to the best of his judgment, the comparative merits of the several claims then under consideration&punc; shall sit in judgment, or give his vote, in award|ing the said premium.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. A full account of the crowned subject shall be published by the Society as soon as may be, after the adjudication, either in a separate publication, or in the next succeeding volume of their transactions, or in both.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The unsuccessful performances shall remain under consideration, and their authors be considered as candidates for the premium, for <HI>five</HI> years next succeeding the time of their presentment; except such performances as their authors may, in the mean time, think fit to withdraw: And the Society shall annually publish an abstract of the titles, object or sub|ject matter of the communications so under consideration, such only excepted as the society shall think not worthy of public notice.</P>

<P N="11">XI. In case there should be a failure in any year, of any communication worthy of the proposed premium, there will then be two premiums to be awarded in the next year. But no accumulation of premiums shall entitle an author to more than one premium for any one discovery, invention or improvement.</P>
