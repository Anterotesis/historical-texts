<P>TO get a&s;surance of the Love of God and Eternal Life, &s;hould be thy Great Work and Bu&s;i|ne&s;s in this World, el&s;e how canst thou dye with Comfort, while thou art doubting, whether thy departing Soul &s;hall be damned or &s;aved? Live with God or Devils eternally? If when thou must bid farewell to all things in this World for ever, and enter into an unchan|geable,

everla&s;ting &s;tate of joy or tor|ments in another World, thou knowe&s;t not which mu&s;t be thy Portion: What the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> can all thy Friends do for thee? What Comfort can thy Riches, Honours, bring into thy Heart at &s;uch a time as this when thou ha&s;t not &s;ecured thy Eter|nal Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>For this end God hath given to fallen Man his Word, whereby he might under|&s;tand his <HI>Mi&s;ery,</HI> and how he came into it; the <HI>Remedy,</HI> and how he might get out of it; by making known the conditi|ons and terms, upon which he is freely willing to receive Sinners into his love and favour, and confer upon them Go&s;pel Priviledges here, and Eternal Glorious Life hereafter, and hath &s;et to his Seal, for a firm conveyance of the&s;e great Eter|nal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le&s;&s;ings, upon &s;uch rea&s;onable, free, and holy terms, as are propounded in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But after &s;uch Love and Grace of God to man appeared, for his <HI>Happi|ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Comfort,</HI> how great an Ene|my is Man unto his real happine&s;s, and well grounded comfort! One to his Hap|pine&s;s,

<P>And indeed the long ab&s;ence of <HI>&s;ome Believers</HI> from, and the carele&s;s ha&s;ting of <HI>all ungodly</HI> to, the Supper of the Lord, is much to be lamented. The former being &s;treightly charged by the Lord, <HI>to do this in Remembrance of him,</HI> yet will not&punc; The Latter threatned with Damnation if they do, yet will. The former whom God hath habitually prepared for it, and it for them, and yet will not come, are in danger of be|ing cut off, becau&s;e they do not, <HI>Numb. 9.13.</HI> The Latter being neither prepared for it, nor it for them, (while &s;uch) are in danger of being cut down by death, be|cau&s;e they do, <HI>1 Cor. 11 30.</HI> The one neglect his means of their Spiritual growth; and &s;light the love, and forget the words of

The one dare not omit to pray, and lead a Holy Life, and yet will not come to wa&s;h their Hearts; the other will not pray, nor lead a holy life, and yet will come to imbrue their hands in the blood of Chri&s;t. Such is the unthankfulne&s;s of &s;ome, that &s;hould, but do not; and the wickedne&s;s of &s;ome that do, but &s;hould not come unto this Go&s;pel Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>Now, to prevent the&s;e two great evils, for the time to come, (as it might prove at lea&s;t, I hope to &s;ome that might peru&s;e this little Treati&s;e) in which &s;omething is &s;aid to provoke the one to their duty, and deter the other from their &s;in and danger.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the be&s;t are too &s;light in their preparation for, and the weak un|skilful

To which are annexed three Dialogues concerning the Lords Supper, for the help of tho&s;e that are the weaker &s;ort of Chri&s;tians, that do de&s;ire to partake thereof. The first be|tween a Mini&s;ter and a private Christi|an, that de&s;ires to partake of the Lords Supper. The &s;econd between a weak Be|liever, that dares not come to, and a &s;trong Believer, that dares not ab&s;ent him|&s;elf from the Lords Supper. The third between one Believer that hath A&s;&s;urance, and another that hath hopes, and another that is under doubtings of the love of God, and of good by the Sacrament, as

In all which, if thou finde&s;t any thing pro|fitable to thy Soul, and tending to promote the Work of Grace wrought in thy Heart, and thy fitne&s;s for, and to help thee in this duty, give God the Glory; but where thou findest any thing that &s;avoureth of the weakne&s;s of the Author, do not cen&s;ure, but pray for him, who is willing, according to his own Talent he hath received from the Lord, to further thee in thy way to Heaven and Eternal Life,</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Containing the Explication of the Text, and the general Conclu&s;ion handled in this Treati&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THE Riches of the Goodne&s;s and Love of God were exceeding a|bundant towards Man in his fir&s;t Creation, when God brought him out of the &s;tate of nothing, and advanced him to the excellency of the hu|mane

Nature, capable not only of ruling his fellow-Creatures in this World, but of know|ing and conver&s;ing with his Lord Creator, who was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to conde&s;cend to enter into Covenant with his <HI>then</HI> innocent Creature, that upon condition of his perfect obeying the Will of his Maker, (which he had then power to perform) he &s;hould con|tinue in that &s;tate of Happine&s;s. But great were the Riches of his Mercy to Man fallen from &s;o great happine&s;s to &s;o great mi&s;ery in making a Covenant of Grace, e&s;tabli&s;hing it in the Blood of his Son, adding his Oath, an|nexing his Seals for the confirmation of our Faith, that we &s;hould upon condition of be|lieving, be Partakers of the great and glorious Priviledges purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t, promi&s;ed in the Scripture, &s;ealed in this Sacrament; con|cerning which the Apo&s;tle &s;pends the latter part of this Chapter, 1. In reproving the <HI>Co|rinthians</HI> for their abu&s;e and prophanation thereof: In that &s;ome that were contentious, and &s;ome that were vicious, even when they were drunken did approach thereto; who degrading them&s;elves below the rank of men, could not then well act their Rea&s;on, when they &s;hould have acted Faith, and Love, and other Graces. It is an hainous &s;in, that tho&s;e that are reeling in the &s;treet &s;hould be &s;een kneeling at the Sacrament. 2. In reducing them to the Primitive In&s;titution, in which there is ob&s;ervable,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Author</HI> of this Ordinance, the Lord
<PB N="3" REF="000909_0010_0FACA0EE1DF0BBE0">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he alone hath power and Autho|rity for the appointing of Ordinances in his Church, and for the In&s;tituting of &s;ignificant Sacramental Signs. He is the King and Pro|phet of his Church, and hath not left it to his Officers at their will and plea&s;ure to introduce any thing that is a part of holy Wor&s;hip; for Chri&s;t was neither &s;hort in wi&s;dom that he could not, nor in goodne&s;s that he would not appoint what&s;oever was &s;ufficient for the Edi|fying of his Church, and the Comfort of his People: <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was admoni&s;hed of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle, that he &s;hould make all things according to the pat|tern &s;hewed to him in the Mount, <HI>Heb</HI> 8.5. <HI>Exod.</HI> 25.40. And <HI>Paul</HI> delivered nothing but what he had received of the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Time</HI> when this Ordinance was ap|pointed by our <HI>Lord Je&s;us,</HI> that &s;ame night in which he was betrayed, when he was &s;o near unto his death, and knew all that was to be done to him, and &s;uffered by him; whereby you might perceive the greatne&s;s of the Love of your dying Lord, that when he was &s;o full of Sorrow, he made provi&s;ion for your Com|fort; and the excellency of this Sacrament, that had its Original from Chri&s;t, when he was &s;o near his end, that &s;hould be for the main|taining of his Peoples Spiritual Life, which was ordained by him now drawing near to death.

<PB N="4" REF="000909_0011_0FACA0EE6C343D08">
Lord ordained at &s;uch a time as this.</P>
<P N="3">3. The external <HI>Elements</HI> and <HI>Signs,</HI> Bread and Wine. In Sacraments there is &s;omething &s;een, and &s;omething under&s;tood; &s;omething perceived by Sen&s;e, and &s;omething apprehend|ed by Faith. Sacraments are Gla&s;&s;es for our under&s;tanding, and Monuments for our Me|mories, that by mean and vi&s;ible &s;igns, we might perceive and call to mind &s;ublime and invi&s;ible things. Here is Bread, even bread of Life, to fill the hungry Soul, and Wine to &s;atisfie the thir&s;ty, and to chear the drooping Soul.</P>
<P N="4">4 The Sacramental <HI>Actions,</HI> 1. Of Chri&s;t, He took the Bread, and ble&s;&s;ed it, and brake it: He took the Cup and ble&s;&s;ed it; and did di&s;tribute both. 2. Of the Receivers, who are to take and eat, to take and drink; Chri&s;t is the Giver, Chri&s;t is the Gift: And what Chri&s;t in love doth give, Believers with joy and thankfulne&s;s &s;hould receive.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The Explication</HI> of this My&s;tery. <HI>This is my Body: This Cup is the New-Te&s;tament in my Blood</HI>: The Bread was not turned into Chri&s;ts real Body; nor the Wine into his Blood: For, did the Di&s;ciples eat Chri&s;ts real Body, when he was with them at the Table? or did they drink his real Blood, which then was in his Veins, and in his Body, and not in the Cup? Or did they not then &s;ee that Chri&s;ts real Body and Blood was really di&s;tinct from the Bread and Wine? And did they not &s;ee it was real Bread, and ta&s;te it was real Bread,
<PB N="5" REF="000909_0012_0FACA0EF213DA4C0">
and handle it as real Bread? Or is now Chri&s;t's glorious Body &s;ubject to Corruption, as is the Bread that is in the Sacrament, and when it is received? Or can a finite Body be in Heaven and upon Earth, in &s;o many places at once, as the Sacrament might be admini|&s;tred in at the &s;ame time? Or do Drunkards and Swearers, Hypocrites and Unbelievers, really eat and drink Chri&s;t's real Body and Blood? The meaning is, this is a &s;ign of my Body, and a &s;ign of my Blood, the Commu|nion of both. As Circumci&s;ion is &s;aid to be the Covenant, &s;o the Bread is Chri&s;ts Body; <HI>Gen</HI> 17.10. <HI>This is my Covenant which ye &s;hall keep between me and you, and thy &s;eed after thee: Every man Child among you &s;hall be Cir|cumci&s;ed:</HI> But yet Circumci&s;ion was not the Covenant, but a Sign and Seal thereof, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4 11. <HI>And he</HI> (that is, <HI>Abraham) received the Sign of Circumci&s;ion, a Seal of the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of the Faith which he had being yet uncircum|ci&s;ed</HI>&mdash;So the Cup in the Sacrament is &s;aid to be the New-Te&s;tament or Covenant, but it is not the very Covenant, but the Sign and Seal thereof.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The Application of this unto its proper Subject</HI>; Chri&s;t declaring who they be that <HI>this</HI> and the things &s;ignified do belong unto, <HI>Which is broken for you,</HI> it is according to the mind of Chri&s;t, that Believers in the Lords Supper &s;hould make particular application of him&s;elf, and of the fruits of his Death and Suf|ferings to them&s;elves: a Believer may take
<PB N="6" REF="000909_0013_0FACA0EFE1C76660">
the Bread, and &s;ay, The Lord Je&s;us dyed for me; and the Wine, and &s;ay, Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;hed his Blood for me.</P>
<P N="7">7 A plain <HI>Injunction</HI> given to Believers to celebrate this Ordinance: <HI>Do this.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. The <HI>Frequency</HI> of attending upon God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t his Table: <HI>As oft as ye do this.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>End</HI> for which we &s;hould approach unto the Table of the Lord: <HI>Do this in re|membrance of me</HI>: Whenever we celebrate the Lords Supper, we commemorate the Lords Death.</P>
<P N="10">10. The <HI>Time, how long</HI> this Ordinance mu&s;t be u&s;ed in the Church, <HI>Till the Lord &s;hall come.</HI> The Lord will come, and till then this Sacra|ment mu&s;t continue; but when he comes to take us to him&s;elf into his glorious Kingdom, we &s;hall need this and other&punc; Ordinances no more: When the end is attained, the means &s;hall cea&s;e; but as the Sacraments of the Old Te&s;tament did continue till Chri&s;ts fir&s;t co|ming in the fle&s;h; &s;o the Sacraments of the New-Te&s;tament &s;hall continue till Chri&s;t's &s;econd coming in Glory.</P>
<P N="11">11. A &s;erious <HI>Admonition</HI> of the Apo&s;tle, that tho&s;e that come to this Ordinance, be care|ful how they eat of <HI>this</HI> Bread, and drink of <HI>this</HI> Cup, <HI>ver.</HI> 27. <HI>Wherefore, who&s;oever &s;hall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, &s;hall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</HI> Unworthy receiving is a great ag|gravation of their &s;in and guilt, who &s;hall pre&s;ume in their heart &s;o to do.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Shewing that Christs Di&s;ciples mu&s;t receive the Lords Supper.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THat it is the nece&s;sary duty of Believers to par|take of the Lords Supper,</HI> I prove:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, There is the &s;ame parity of Rea&s;on that Believers under the Go&s;pel &s;hould receive the Lords Supper, as the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> under the Law &s;hould eat the Lords pa&s;&s;eover: This was their duty, as is pre&s;cribed, <HI>Exod.</HI> 12. where is the Fir&s;t In&s;titution, the manner how, the end for which.

<P>And there is as great rea&s;on for Believers to

<P>Fir&s;t, in the <HI>Author</HI> and efficient Cau&s;e; God appointed both.</P>
<P>Secondly, In the <HI>Matter</HI> principally &s;ignified in both, and that is Chri&s;t, and the &s;ame bene|fits and priviledges held forth, and conveyed to Believers in both, as remi&s;&s;ion of Sin, Ju&s;ti|fication, &amp; &s;piritual Nouri&s;hment and Growth in Grace.</P>
<P>Thirdly, In the <HI>End,</HI> to commemorate the mercy and goodne&s;s, of God in the deliverance of his People from Captivity of Sin, and Bon|dage of the Devil.</P>
<P>Fourthly, In the <HI>In&s;trument</HI> of receiving &amp; applying the thing &s;ignified by both, and that is Faith&punc;</P>
<P>Fifthly, In the <HI>Parts</HI>; in both, &s;omething <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ign, and &s;omething &s;ignified.</P>
<P>Sixthly, In the <HI>Properties</HI> of the Pa&s;chal Lamb, which are in Chri&s;t our Pa&s;sover.</P>

<P N="6">6 That ro&s;t with fire; Chri&s;t with the heat of Gods wrath.</P>
<P N="7">7 That mu&s;t be eaten; Chri&s;t mu&s;t be re|ceived by Faith.</P>

<P N="3">3 With bitter Herbs; Chri&s;t and this Or|dinance, with bitter Repentings.</P>
<P N="4">4. Wholly, all of it mu&s;t be eaten, whole Chri&s;t mu&s;t be received in all his Offices, Pro|phet, Prie&s;t, and King, Chri&s;t as the Pa&s;chal Lamb mu&s;t be received with all his appurte|nances</P>
<P N="5">5. In ha&s;t; Chri&s;t mu&s;t be received pre|&s;ently, without delay.</P>
<P>Seventhly, In the <HI>Subject</HI> that mu&s;t eat there|of, they were <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> and tho&s;e that were Circumci&s;ed. Tho&s;e that &s;hould partake of this Ordinance ought to be <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> indeed; and Circumci&s;ed in their hearts, if they would have benefit thereby. Thus you &s;ee the great agreement betwixt tho&s;e two Ordinances: And were the <HI>Jews</HI> bound to ob&s;erve that, and not Believers under the Go&s;pel engaged unto this; Nay, I may argue, that there is a greater rea&s;on why we &s;hould be more for|ward to this duty, in as much, wherein they differ, this is more excellent. As,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="16" REF="000909_0023_0FACA0F76191A890">1. In the manner of their &s;ignification, the Pa&s;&s;eover &s;ignified Chri&s;t that was to come; the Lords Supper, Chri&s;t already come.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the Duration. The pa&s;&s;eover was to continue till the coming of Chri&s;t in the Fle&s;h: The Lords Supper till he come again in Glo|ry, in the end of the World.</P>
<P N="3">3 In the per&s;picuity and clearne&s;s: In the former, Chri&s;ts death was &s;ignified more darkly, in the latter more plainly.</P>
<P>Now I be&s;eech you, &s;ee what the Pa&s;&s;eover was to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and con&s;ider that <HI>that</HI> the Lords Supper is to us, and there will appear the &s;ame parity of rea&s;on for our receiving of this, as for the <HI>Jews</HI> eating of that.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is the plain Injunction of our dying Lord, that we &s;hould do this in remem|brance of him; Why do you pray? One rea|&s;on you will give is, becau&s;e God Commands it: And if you pray becau&s;e God commands you, you mu&s;t then do every thing that God commands you, and &s;o this: Is it not &s;trictly commanded? Read <HI>Luk</HI> 22.19 The whole is commanded. <HI>This do in remembrance of me,</HI> Mat. 26.26, 27. The particular Acts are commanded, <HI>Take, Eat, Drink,</HI> &amp; will you &s;ay you will not? Will that become a Di&s;ci|ple of Chri&s;t? You &s;ay not, you will not, but you know you do not, and that is as bad.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Chri&s;t did ordain it for this very end, that believers &s;hould have a remem|brance of him in the partaking of this Ordi|nance: We are apt to forget the Works of
<PB N="17" REF="000909_0024_0FACA0F8259AC908">
God, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 106.13. Too apt to forget the benefits we received from God, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 103.2.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The Second Conclu&s;ion, &s;hewing that Believ|ers mu&s;t often receive the Lords Supper.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THat it is the duty of the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, often to partake of the Lords Supper.</HI></P>
<P>Bapti&s;m is but once to be admini&s;tred, but the Lords Supper is often to be received; the frequency of it is not determined, often it mu&s;t be, how often is not expre&s;&s;ed; if you had opportunity every Lords Day, and you re|deemed and improved it, your Soul may thrive and grow the more in grace and holi|ne&s;s: Meals which are for nouri&s;hment mu&s;t be often; you often eat, and you often drink for the nouri&s;hment of Nature, and yet it is not told you how often you mu&s;t eat, how often you mu&s;t drink, but the &s;en&s;e and feeling of the want of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ood, will direct you un|to this: So if you have but a &s;en&s;e and feel|ing of the want of this Ordinance, and the things that are there conferred upon Believers, that would guide to a frequent iteration of this Ordinance. Con&s;ider therefore,</P>
<P>Do you not often &s;tand in need of being wa&s;hed in the Blood of Chri&s;t? Do you not often defile your &s;elf, and gather filth upon your Soul&punc; And &s;hould you not often apply your &s;elf to the Fountain of the clean&s;ing Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="000909_0043_0FACA16C6307E928">Secondly, Do you not often blot your E|vidences, and di&s;turb your peace? and have you not need of the frequent u&s;e of that Ordi|nance, wherein God might renew your evi|dence and &s;peak peace unto your Con&s;cience? Do you often contract guilt, and &s;hould you not often come to have your pardon &s;ealed and confirmed to your Soul in the blood of Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>Thirdly, Do you not often need the means of &s;piritual warmth and quicknings? Are you not often dull, and often dead, and often luke|warm? and do not tho&s;e that are often &s;ick, often need their Phi&s;ick to purge and make them well? If you are &s;ometime warmed in an Ordinance, do not your affections abate again? That you have not that liveline&s;s of affections, nor that reviving joy, which in the actual performance of the duty you did find? and is it needful to exhort you that have found the benefit of this Ordinance, to go of|ten to it? Let the Experience of what you have found in it, and the want you do lie un|der by &s;eldom approaching unto it, quicken your de&s;ires after a frequent attendance upon God in it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Do you not often need &s;o great an help for the breaking and &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tning of your heart, for the renewing of your repentance for &s;in, and &s;trengthning and confirming of your re&s;olutions again&s;t it? Is not your heart too apt to fall in love with &s;in, and to renew its League with &s;in? Do you not often need to
<PB N="37" REF="000909_0044_0FACA16D222F09A0">
be put in remembrance of Gods di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t it, his hatred that he bears unto it, &amp; the dreadful effects and de&s;erts thereof, and is not this done more livelily in the Lords Sup|per? Gods di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t &s;in is more di&s;|covered in the Death of Chri&s;t, than in turn|ing the Angels out of Heaven, or <HI>Adam</HI> out of Paradi&s;e; or in the De&s;truction of the Old World, or in the burning of <HI>Sodom,</HI> or in the Damnation of innumerable unbelieving and impenitent Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Do you not often need &s;o great an help for the increa&s;ing of your Love to God and Chri&s;t? Do you often complain that you love God no more, and will you not more often u&s;e this &s;o great a means for the encrea|&s;ing of your Love?</P>
<P>Sixthly, Do you not often need &s;o great an help for the &s;trengthning of your Faith and Hope, that you may be more able to make a particular application of Chri&s;t and his bene|fits to your Soul, and to have a more lively Hope of the Kingdom of Heaven?</P>
<P>Seventhly, Do you not often need &s;o great an help to put you in remembrance of your Lord Je&s;us? Are you not too apt to forget him and his Love in dying for you? Is he &s;o much in your Thoughts as he doth de&s;erve? Or is it enough to have &s;ome Occa&s;ional Thoughts of Chri&s;t? Or &s;hould you not more &s;olemnly dwell in your Meditations up|on him? And doth not the Nature and the end of this Ordinance lead and help you to
<PB N="38" REF="000909_0045_0FACA16DE05F5E68">
fix your thoughts more permanently upon him, when you &s;ee how he was crucified and died for you?</P>
<P>Eighthly, Do you not often need &s;o great an help to make you more thankful for the matchle&s;s Love wherewith he hath loved you, and the unparallel'd B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ings he hath purcha|&s;ed for you, and conferred upon you? Is it not a &s;hame and &s;in, you are no more in prai&s;ing God, and rejoycing in him for &s;uch priviledges that were procured b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the blood of his only Son, and your deare&s;t Lord? And can you &s;it at the Table and not have your Souls rai&s;ed in the highe&s;t Admiration of his Love and Mercy to you?</P>
<P>Ninthly, Do you not often need &s;o great an help for the getting and maintaining of more intimate Communion with God, and fellow|&s;hip with Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Is it not here, that God doth abundantly let forth him&s;elf into his peoples Hearts? Is it not here, that Believers feel the goings forth of their Hearts in Love unto him, and De&s;ires after him, and Delight and Joy in him? Do you complain you have &s;o little of God, and will not more often go where you may receive more influences from him.</P>
<P>Tenthly, Do you not more often need &s;o great an help for the clo&s;er knitting of your Heart unto the people of God in greater af|fection and love unto them? Do you love them as you &s;hould? Or is there not too great an alienation of your heart and Affecti|on
<PB N="39" REF="000909_0046_0FACA16EA1F57758">
from them? Or doth not this Ordinance which &s;hews you the Love of Chri&s;t to all his People incite them that attend upon it, to imi|tate the Lord Je&s;us in loving of them? That we &s;hould love one another as he hath loved us: When we &s;ee we are <HI>one Bread,</HI> and re|deemed by <HI>one Lord,</HI> and fed at <HI>one Table,</HI> and are wa&s;hed in the <HI>&s;ame Blood,</HI> and enjoy the <HI>&s;ame Priviledges,</HI> and are here a&s;&s;ured of the <HI>&s;ame Inheritance</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI>; doth it not engage us to be of one Heart, and to be kindly affe|ctionate to one another, as Chri&s;t was to us all? Though it is to be bewai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed with Tears of Blood, that this Ordinance which &s;hould have cemented us in love, and &s;odered our hearts together, though our corruption hath been the occa&s;ion, not the cau&s;e of great brea|ches and divi&s;ions in the Church of God.</P>
<P>Thus if you &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider your own frequent wants, and often reflect upon your often need of this Ordinance, you will &s;ee &s;uffi|cient rea&s;on for your often participation of &s;o frequently needful an Ordinance</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Third Conclu&s;ion, proving we are to give great diligence to prepare our &s;elves for the receiving of the Lords Supper.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THat when&s;oever you are to partake of the Lords Supper, you are to be painful &amp; &s;erious in ma|king preparation for it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="000909_0047_0FACA16F62156720">This preparation mu&s;t be for the&s;e rea&s;ons, which you may lay to your heart, and find them to be quickning motives to &s;tir you up thereto.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, From the preparation they were wont to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Pa&s;&s;eover under the Law, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 30.3. <HI>They could not keep it at that time, becau&s;e the Prie&s;ts had not &s;anctified them&s;elves &s;ufficiently</HI>: They did for a while defer it till they had made more preparation for it: And after their diligence to prepare, they prayed for the pardon of their imperfect preparation, 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 30.18, 19&punc; <HI>The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to &s;eek God, the Lord God of his Fathers, though he be not clean&s;ed according to the purification of the Sanctuary</HI>: If any man were unclean, he was to &s;tay another Month, and then eat it, <HI>Numb.</HI> 9.10, 11.</P>
<P>That they prepared for the Pa&s;&s;eover, ap|pears by,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Actions they did before the Pa&s;&s;e|over.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Di&s;cour&s;e they had with their Chil|dren before the Pa&s;&s;eover.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Time they took up before the Pa&s;&s;eover.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, From the Actions before.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Before they did eat the Pa&s;&s;eover, they were to clean&s;e their Hou&s;hold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tuff, their Ve&s;&s;els and U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en&s;ils from all leavened Bread, that none might be found in them, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cleave unto them.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="000909_0048_0FACA17021B31340">The Parallel is, Before we eat the Lords Supper, we mu&s;t clean&s;e our hearts and lives from all known &s;in, that we allow our &s;elves in no known wickedne&s;s, that we do not drive a trade of &s;in, nor be drudges to the Devil, nor Factors for Hell; we may come with many &s;ins <HI>bewailed, striving again&s;t, and groaning un|der them,</HI> but not with one &s;in <HI>allowed</HI> and <HI>ap|proved</HI> of.</P>
<P>Secondly, Then they made a &s;tricter &s;earch after any bit of leavened Bread, by lighting a Candle, and looking into every little Corner and Chink in the Hou&s;e, the Night before the Pa&s;&s;eover.</P>
<P>The Parallel of this is, a Clo&s;er &s;earching of our hearts, by lighting the Candle of Con|&s;cience at the Fire of Gods Word, and look|ing into every Room and Corner of our Hearts, le&s;t there &s;hould be any &s;in lurking in our Souls, and remaining undi&s;covered: We &s;hould enquire after the &s;ins in our under&s;tand|ing, Will, and Affections, what is ami&s;s in our Love, Delight, Joy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Then having &s;ound the Reliques and Fragments of leavened Bread, they ca&s;t it out: That they would not only not u&s;e it, but not have it in their &s;ight, that they may not &s;et their Eyes upon it, nor look towards it, or would burn it till it were con&s;umed.</P>
<P>The parallel of this is, The ca&s;ting away of our &s;ins, when by diligent &s;earch we have found it ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. We mu&s;t not find our &s;in, to indulge it, but to for&s;ake and kill it: Not to
<PB N="42" REF="000909_0049_0FACA170E61534E0">
have our Hearts to hanker after our &s;in, when we come to the Lords Table.</P>
<P>Fourthly, They had a Form of Words for the cur&s;ing of that leavened Bread, which they could not find out, <HI>viz. All the Leaven that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in my power, whether &s;een by me, or not &s;een, clean&s;ed by me, or not clean&s;ed; let it be nothing, let it be esteemed as nothing; as the dust of the Earth, let it be &s;cattered and de&s;troyed.</HI></P>
<P>The Parallel of this is, The di&s;owning of every &s;in, &s;een or not &s;een, after this manner, <HI>Lord, if there be any &s;in in me, which after all my &s;earching of my Heart, I have not found out, let it be accur&s;ed, let it be as nothing, as the du&s;t of the Earth; if there be any &s;in in me, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not dealt &s;everely with, it is not becau&s;e I love it, but becau&s;e I could not find it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, From the Di&s;cour&s;e they had be|fore they came, appears they did prepare for it. This was betwixt the Father and hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Children.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The Children inquired, <HI>What is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> meaning of this Service</HI>; Then the Parents an&s;wered, It is the Lords Pa&s;&s;eover, who pa&s;&s;ed over the hou&s;es of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in <HI>E|gypt,</HI> when he &s;mote the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and deli|vered our Hou&s;es, <HI>Exod</HI> 12.26, 27.</P>
<P>The Parallel of this is, That Chri&s;tians &s;hould di&s;cour&s;e together, or &s;peak unto them|&s;elves in holy Soliloquy, <HI>viz.</HI> What is the meaning, O my Soul, of this Service, of this Love of Chri&s;t in appointing this holy Ordi|nance? What doth it bring to thy remem|brance,
<PB N="43" REF="000909_0050_0FACA171A555CCE0">
O my Soul? And here you have Oc|ca&s;ion of expatiating the whole method of God in exalting the freene&s;s of his Grace in Mans Redemption. <HI>Oh, what meant my deare&s;t Lord in &s;hedding of his blood, and ordaining this for the commemoration of it! Surely it was, O my Soul, to deliver thee from mi&s;ery, to make thee Partaker of his Grace and Love&punc; and to Seal it to thee, and make thee to rejoyce in the remembrance of it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, The Children ask, <HI>Why do we eat it with bitter Herbs</HI>? The Parents an&s;wered, Becau&s;e the <HI>Egyptians</HI> made the Life of our Fa|thers bitter in <HI>Egypt,</HI> that they may be &s;tirred up to greater thankfulne&s;s unto God.</P>
<P>The Parallel of this is, That we &s;hould re|flect upon our &s;ins, which made our lives bit|ter while we lived in them, and that now we &s;hould ta&s;te more bitterne&s;s in our &s;ins, than ever we found &s;weetne&s;s, plea&s;ure and delight therein.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Why <HI>do we eat it with unleavened bread?</HI> The Parents were to an&s;wer, Becau&s;e the Dough of our Fathers had not time to be leavened.</P>
<P>The Parallel of this is, That we mu&s;t make ha&s;te to Chri&s;t, and eat this New-Te&s;tament Pa&s;&s;eover with the unleavened Bread of &s;ince|rity and truth: That we mu&s;t not delay to come out of &s;piritual-<HI>Egypt,</HI> nor go to Chri&s;t in hypocri&s;ie, but in truth.</P>
<P>Thirdly, From the time there was betwixt the taking, and the killing of the Pa&s;chal
<PB N="44" REF="000909_0051_0FACA17262A6C9E0">
Lamb; the Lamb was taken the tenth day, and killed the fourteenth day of the month, <HI>Exod,</HI> 12.3. <HI>ad</HI> 7. And it is received as a Tradition among the <HI>Jews,</HI> that for the dura|tion of tho&s;e four days, the Lamb was tied to their Bed-po&s;ts, that in the Evening when they went to bed, and in the Morning when they aro&s;e, and in the day-time when they were private in their Chambers; the &s;ight of the Lamb might affect their hearts, and put them in mind of the work they were to do, and be|think them&s;elves of the greatne&s;s of Gods Mer|cy towards them, in delivering them from <HI>E|gyptian</HI> Bondage.</P>
<P>The Parallel of this is, That believers, be|fore the Lords Supper, &s;hould take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> compe|tent mea&s;ure of time to bethink them&s;elves of the Love of God in delivering them from Sin and Hell, infinitely wor&s;e than <HI>Egyptian</HI> Bon|dage, and prepare them&s;elves to commemorate the Death of Chri&s;t, and be partakers of the great Ble&s;&s;ing that at the Lords Table true Believers have conferred upon them.</P>
<P>It is not &s;ufficient to &s;pend an hour the night before, or in the morning you are to approach unto it, but &s;ome day before to have it in your thoughts, that you may con&s;ider the greatne&s;s of the work you are to go about.</P>
<P>This Example of the <HI>Jews</HI> is cogent unto us, fora&s;much as the Lords Supper is not in|feriour to the Pa&s;&s;eover.</P>
<P N="1">1. Neither in the <HI>Institution</HI> of it; the Pa&s;&s;e|over was by Gods Ordination, and &s;o is the
<PB N="45" REF="000909_0052_0FACA173213EBA18">
Lords&punc; Supper, but God appointed that by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>: But this was by Chri&s;t him&s;elf in his own per&s;on.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor in the <HI>&s;ignification</HI> of it: That to put them in remembrance of their deliverance from <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and Typically from Hell: This puts us in remembrance of the love of Chri&s;t, in bringing us from mi&s;ery, and freeing us from torments infinitely wor&s;e than <HI>Aegyptian</HI> &s;lavery.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nor in the <HI>u&s;e and end</HI> of it, this being a &s;eal of the Covenant of Grace, to convey to Believers an a&s;&s;urance of the ble&s;&s;ings of the Covenant of promi&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4 Nor in the <HI>manner</HI> of its &s;ignification: That a &s;ign of Chri&s;t that was to come and &s;uffer; this, that Chri&s;t is come, and hath al|ready &s;uffered.</P>
<P>This is my fir&s;t Argument why, and Mo|tive that we &s;hould approach to the Lords Supper, after painful and &s;erious preparation: <HI>No Preparation, no participation.</HI> It is not then putting on our finer Cloaths on a Sacra|ment day, but the Trimming of our hearts, that God expecteth at our hands.</P>
<P>The Second Argument for preparation for the Sacrament, is taken from the <HI>Author</HI> of it, which is God: The more he that doth invite you to his Table is your Superiour, the more you prepare your &s;elves to go to &s;it down thereat, more than if he be your Inferiour, or your equal. God is infin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ely your Superi|our: Con&s;ider what this God is that pre|pares
<PB N="46" REF="000909_0053_0FACA173E6845A00">
this Banquet for you, and prepare for it.</P>
<P N="1">1. He is a great and a <HI>mighty</HI> God, a God of inconceivable Maje&s;ty, and tran&s;cendent Glory, who&s;e perfection is infinitely above the mo&s;t rai&s;ed apprehen&s;ions of Angels &amp; Men: and would you go unto the Table of a great King with filthy hands, and in your rags? And would you go to the Table of the great King of Heaven and Earth with a filthy heart, and in your &s;ins?</P>
<P N="2">2. He is a pure and an <HI>holy God:</HI> Indeed every thing here is holy, the <HI>Signs</HI> are holy Signs, the <HI>things &s;ignified</HI> are holy things, the <HI>Ends</HI> of the In&s;titution are holy ends, and the <HI>Author</HI> of it is the holy God; and &s;hall our hearts only be unholy? the very externals &amp; uten&s;ils about it, are and &s;hould be clean; the Cups are clean, the Cloth is clean, el&s;e you would be offended, and &s;hould not your Heart be clean? If not, would not your God be offended?</P>
<P N="3">3. The Author of this Ordinanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is a <HI>God of infinite Jealou&s;ie,</HI> and he is mo&s;t jealous in the matters of his Wor&s;hip. In the Second Command, which &s;ets forth the manner of Gods<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">Wor&s;hip, he makes him&s;elf known by this Attribute, That he is a <HI>jealous</HI> God; and if his Jealou&s;ie &s;hould be kindled again&s;t you at his Table, it would be uncomfortable, it will be terrible to you.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Author of this Ordinance is an
<PB N="47" REF="000909_0054_0FACA1756FEF6878">
<HI>Omni&s;cient God,</HI> and cannot be deceived; if there be but one among a thou&s;and that re|ceiveth unworthily, his eye will be upon him; he knows his Name, and &s;ees where he &s;its, God knows the frame of your heart, he knows your end why you are there, and what your diligence was before you came; then come prepared.</P>
<P>The third Argument for diligent preparati|on is taken from the <HI>matter</HI> of this Sacrament: The more excellent and noble any thing is, the more hainous is the abu&s;e thereof. If a Servant brake and &s;poil &s;ome earthen Pitchers, his Ma&s;ter may more ea&s;ily pa&s;s it by, but if he take his Jewels, and his precious Pearls, and ca&s;t them in the kennel, and bury them in the dunghil, he will be more difficultly pacified. If a man &s;hall deal unju&s;tly with a|nother, it will be di&s;plea&s;ing unto God; but if he &s;hall deal unworthily with his Son, he will be provoked: If you &s;hould abu&s;e your common Bread and Drink, which God daily gives you for your ordinary repa&s;t and nou|ri&s;hment, you commit a Soul-damning Sin; but if you prophane the&s;e &s;piritual dainties, without repentance, your damnation will be aggravated.</P>
<P>Here you have to do with blood, and <HI>then</HI> if ever, you &s;hould be &s;erious; but mo&s;t of all when it is the Blood of God. Con&s;ider before you go, that you have <HI>to do with the Blood of Chri&s;t,</HI> and let that quicken you to preparation.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="000909_0055_0FACA17625B2F0A0">The fourth Argument for diligent prepa|ration is from the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> that is to be par|taker of it; as we may be con&s;idered in a twofold &s;tate or capacity.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>What we were.</ITEM>
<ITEM>What we are.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Every Man is born unfit for the Lords Table</HI>: We were Enemies to God, and therefore except we will come in our enmi|ty to God, we m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t prepare and fit our &s;elves, by being reconciled unto God: We are <HI>born</HI> &s;piritually dead, and it would not be &s;o loath&s;ome a &s;ight to us to have a dead Corps full of plague &s;ores &s;et down at our Table, as a man dead in Sin to &s;it down at Gods Table, is loath&s;ome unto God: <HI>Where there is no Life, there is no Appetite; and where there is no Appetite, there is no actual preparation to this duty.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Such as are <HI>truly converted, may yet be indi&s;po&s;ed for this duty</HI>; therefore there mu&s;t be preparation. It is not every one that hath true grace, is pre&s;ently to be judg|ed <HI>actually</HI> fit for this Ordinance: As a man that is a&s;leep, is a living, real man, but yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e it not fit to eat, and drink, and conver&s;e with men; &s;o a man may have Faith, and Love, and Hope, and yet not be fit for this duty, if his Faith be a&s;leep, and Love and Hope be a&s;leep: For a <HI>man that is a worthy Receiver; might re|ceive unworthily</HI>; my meaning is, That one that is habitually prepared by having the

<P>Fifth Argument for Preparation, is taken from the <HI>Con&s;equents</HI> which will be an&s;werable to our preparation, or neglect thereof, which will be either bad or good For though God doth not be&s;tow the great things in the Sacra|ment <HI>for</HI> our preparation, yet he will not give them <HI>without</HI> our preparation.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The con&s;equents of coming unprepa|red will be very dreadful.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Such do fearfully increa&s;e their guilt, in a very high degree,</HI> in making them&s;elves guilty of the Body and Blood of Chri&s;t, though not as an <HI>Actor</HI> in his death, yet virtually as an <HI>Abetter</HI> and <HI>Con&s;enter</HI>; for an <HI>unworthy Receiv|er, is a Christ murderer,</HI> as he that defaceth the Kings Picture, doth reflect upon his Per|&s;on. He that dares ru&s;h upon the Sacrament with <HI>reigning-&s;in</HI> in his heart, would be a <HI>Ju|das</HI> unto Chri&s;t, if he were per&s;onally upon Earth; and had <HI>Judas</HI> his opportunity, temp|tations and other circum&s;tances, he would wa&s;h his hands in the blood of Chri&s;t: that comes, but not to have his <HI>heart</HI> wa&s;hed in the Sacrament, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.27. And will you

<HI>&s;o come,</HI> to have your &s;in increa&s;ed, in&s;tead of having of it pardoned?</P>
<P>O what a crying Sin is <HI>Blood guiltine&s;s,</HI> tho' it be but the blood of a common man: But what will it be to be guilty of the Blood of the Son of God! Did not the Blood of <HI>Abel</HI> cry again&s;t <HI>Cain</HI> for vengeance? Oh what a <HI>voice</HI> and <HI>cry</HI> will there be then in the Blood of Chri&s;t! and will you have the Blood of Chri&s;t <HI>cry again&s;t</HI> you, in&s;tead of <HI>pleading for</HI> you? Nay, you will &s;in more than many of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that did actually crucifie him, for many of them did it ignorantly; for had they known him, they could not have crucified the Lord of Glory, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.8.

It would have been better for <HI>Judas</HI> if he had not been born, and it would be better for you if you never had received.</P>
<P N="2">2. Such <HI>draw down great Judgments upon them&s;elves</HI>; and no wonder if great guilt and great &s;in be followed with great Judgments; for God will proportion mens &s;ufferings to their &s;innings. <HI>He that cometh without the Wedding Garment on his Soul, &s;hall go away with a Cur&s;e upon his Head and Heart.</HI></P>

<P N="2">(2.)

<P>Secondly, The good Con&s;equents are very great if you rightly receive it, with due prepa|ration and care; and is not that your end in coming to it, that you may be better for it?

They that have not fir&s;t received a <HI>whole</HI> Chri&s;t in the Go&s;pel in all his Office<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, cannot receive a <HI>broken</HI> Chri&s;t in the Sacrament: They are not united unto Chri&s;t, and where there is no union, there can be no communi|on; they are not ingrafted into Chri&s;t, and therefore they receive no fruit from the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t.

<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e <HI>many that are habitually prepared, may be too &s;light in actual preparation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>&punc; They did not &s;eriou&s;ly, throughly &s;earch their hearts and lives, nor enquire after their &s;ins and wants; they do not &s;olemnly, but &s;light|ly pray to God before hand: They do not quicken their hungrings after Chri&s;t, nor go with great, believing expectations of receiving great things from God in this duty.</P>

<P>Yes, or el&s;e I mu&s;t go home and weep for this as well as you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>How doth that appear?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e God doth work variou&s;ly upon divers Per&s;ons, and variou&s;ly upon the &s;ame Per&s;on at divers times. Sometimes he breaks the heart for &s;in, and re&s;erves his comforts for another time: If you do not find your heart inflamed with love and filled with joy, yet if you do find your heart to ri&s;e more in hatred unto &s;in, and to be grieved for it, and more re&s;olve and watch again&s;t it, you have receiv|ed benefit by this Ordinance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Then I mu&s;t take heed of the &s;tratagems of the Devil, that, as he might not cau&s;e me to con|clude, I have that which I have not; &s;o neither to deny that I have not that which through mercy God hath given to me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will be your wi&s;dom, becau&s;e it will be your way to get more from God, by being thankful for a little: God will another time give you peace and comfort, if now you will give him thanks that you have wept for your &s;in, and been grieved for the &s;ame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Lord! my heart begins to warm; I think the Sacrament may work and affect my heart, after I am come away, though I was dull when I was there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A&punc;</SPEAKER>
<P>So it may, and &s;o I have &s;ometimes found i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, though to day God hath wonderful|fully

&s;milled upon &s;uch a vile unworthy &s;in|ner as I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would advi&s;e you to take heed, that you do not conclude, that you have no be|nefit at all becau&s;e you have not &s;o much as you expected and de&s;ired, or &s;o much as you &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e other Chri&s;tians to have; or that you have it not in that particular or kind that you looked for; or though you did not &s;en&s;ibly perceive it in the very act of receiving.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what may be the cau&s;e that I found no more of God in the time of this Ordi|nance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be you were too &s;light in your Preparations for this Duty; or if enlarged in them you tru&s;ted too much to them, and le&s;s to Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;t than you &s;hould have done; or were not watchful in the time of the Ordi|nance, or do too much favour &s;ome peculiar &s;in; and God with-holds what you expected, that you might mend that with which he is offended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>This will be mercy, if <HI>I</HI> mi&s;&s;ed of Com|fort, that <HI>I</HI> may have le&s;s of &s;in; and &s;hall de|&s;ire of the Lord, that <HI>I</HI> may find &s;ome good by the Ordinance, and your Di&s;cour&s;e, now <HI>I</HI> do go in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, one word more, and that is, that we all remember the Obligations that do lie upon us to walk &s;uitably to the Priviledges we are made partakers of by the death of Chri&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="212" REF="000909_0213_0FACA121613196D0">
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is well remembred, for we are apt to forget to make returns to God, when we have received great things from him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will do well, for then it may be <HI>I</HI> might feel more the efficacy of this Ordi|nance, than yet <HI>I</HI> have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes you may, and therefore let us all con&s;ider, and bear it upon our hearts, where we have been this day, and how we have re|newed our Covenant with God, and that his Vows are upon us, and his eyes to ob&s;erve how we &s;hall walk, and live after we have had, or do hope for peace and joy in him; and that we watch each other, that where any of us fail, the other will reprove in love, and re&s;tore him with a Spirit of meekne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this will be needful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Lord enable us by his Grace to di&s;charge what God commands, that we may expect what he doth promi&s;e in his Word, &amp; hath &s;ealed to us in this Sacrament.</P>
