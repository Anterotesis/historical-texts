<HEAD>NOTES ON THE ESTABLISMENT OF A MONEY UNIT, AND OF A COINAGE FOR THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<P>IN fixing the Unit of Money, the&s;e circum&s;tances are of principal importance.</P>
<P N="1">I. That it be of <HI>convenient &s;ize</HI> to be applied as a mea|&s;ure to the common money tran&s;actions of life.</P>
<P N="2">II. That its parts and multiples be in <HI>an ea&s;y propor|tion</HI> to each other, &s;o as to facilitate the money arith|metic.</P>
<P N="3">III. That the unit and its parts or divi&s;ions be <HI>&s;o near|ly of the value of &s;ome of the known coins,</HI> as that they may be of ea&s;y adoption for the people.</P>
<P>The Spanish dollar &s;eems to fulfil all the&s;e conditions.</P>
<P N="1">I. Taking into our view all money tran&s;actions, great and &s;mall, I que&s;tion if a common mea&s;ure of more <HI>con|venient
<PB N="2" REF="018541_0002_0FA7B3182E3358C8" MS="y">
&s;ize</HI> than the dollar could be propo&s;ed. The va+lue of 100, 1000, 10,000 dollars is well e&s;timated by the mind. So is that of the tenth or the hundredth of a dol|lar. Few tran&s;actions are above or below the&s;e limits. The expediency of attending to the &s;ize of the money unit will be evident to any one who will con&s;ider how incon|venient it would be to a manufacturer or merchant, if, in&s;tead of the yard for mea&s;uring cloth, either the inch or the mile had been made the unit of mea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="2">II. The mo&s;t <HI>ea&s;y ratio</HI> of multiplication and divi&s;ion is that by ten. Every one knows the facility of decimal arithmetic. Every one remembers, that, when learning money-arithmetic, he u&s;ed to be puzzled with adding the farthings, taking out the fours and carrying them on; ad|ding the pence, taking out the twelves, and carrying them on; adding the shillings, taking out the twenties and car|rying them on. But when he came to the pounds, where he had only tens to carry forward, it was ea&s;y and free from error. The bulk of mankind are &s;chool boys thro' life. The&s;e little perplexities are always great to them. And even mathematical heads feel the relief of an ea&s;ier &s;ub&s;tituted for a more difficult proce&s;s. Foreigners too who trade or travel among us, will find a great facility in under&s;tanding our coins and accounts from this ratio of &s;ubdivi&s;ion. Tho&s;e who have had occa&s;ion to convert the livres, &s;ols and deniers of the French, the gilders, &s;ilvers and penings of the Dutch, the pounds, shillings, pence and farthings of the&s;e &s;everal &s;tates into each other, can judge how much they would have been aided had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;everal &s;ubdivi&s;ions been in a decimal ratio. Certainly in all ca&s;es where we are free to chu&s;e between ea&s;y and difficult modes of operation, it is mo&s;t rational to chu&s;e the ea&s;y. The Financier, therefore, in his report, well propo&s;es that our coins should be in decimal proportions to one another. If we adopt the dollar for our unit, we should &s;trike four coins, one of gold, two of &s;ilver, and one of copper. viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A golden piece equal in value to 10 dollars.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The unit, or dollar, of &s;ilver.</ITEM>

<ITEM><PB N="3" REF="018541_0003_0FA7B318F4377A38">4. The hundredth of a dollar, of copper.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Compare the arithmetical operations on the &s;ame &s;um of money expre&s;&s;ed in this form, and expre&s;&s;ed in the pound &s;terling and its divi&s;ions.</P>

<P><PB N="4" REF="018541_0004_0FA7B319AE2FB718">Divi&s;ion by 8. <GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>A bare in&s;pection of the above operations will evince the labour which is occa&s;ioned by &s;ubdividing the unit into 20ths, 240ths, and 960ths, as the English do, and as we have done; and the ea&s;e of &s;ubdivi&s;ions in a decimal ratio. The &s;ame difference ari&s;es in making payment. An Eng|lishman, to pay 8l 13s. 11 d. &frac12; qrs mu&s;t find by calculation what combination of the coins of his country will pay this &s;um. But an American, having the &s;ame &s;um to pay, thus expre&s;&s;ed 38.65 Dollars, will know by in&s;pection only, that 3 golden pieces, 8 units or dollars, 6 tenths and five coppers pay it preci&s;ely.</P>
<P N="3">III. The third condition required, is that the unit, its multiples, and &s;ubdivi&s;ions coincide in value with &s;ome of the known coins &s;o nearly, that the people may, by a quick reference in the mind, e&s;timate their value. If this be not attended to, they will be very long in adopting the innovation, if ever they adopt it. Let us examine in this point of view each of the four coins propo&s;ed.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="018541_0005_0FA7B31B215080E0">1. The golden piece will be &frac15; more than a half Joe, and 1/15 more than a double guinea. It will be readily e&s;ti|mated then by reference to either of them; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> and accurately as equal to 10 dollars.</P>
<P N="2">2. The unit or dollar is a known coin, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mo&s;t fa|miliar of all to the minds of the people It is already adopt|ed from South to North; has identified our currency, and therefore happily offers it&s;elf as an unit already introduced. Our public debt, our requi&s;itions, and their apportion|ments have given it actual and long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place of unit. The cour&s;e of our commerce too will bring us more of this than of any other foreign coin, and therefore renders it more worthy of attention. I know of no unit which can be propo&s;ed in competition with the dollar, but the pound. But what is the pound? <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">5<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">7 grains of fine &s;ilver in Georgia; 1289 grains in Virginia, Connecticut, Rhode i&s;land, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, and New Hampshire; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">031 &frac14; grains in Maryland, Delaware, Penn&s;ylvania, and New Jer&s;ey; 966 &frac34; grains in North Carolina and New York. Which of the&s;e shall we adopt? To which &s;tate give that pre-eminence, of which all are &s;o jealous? And on which impo&s;e the difficulties of a new e&s;timate for their corn, their ca<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">tle, and other commodities? Or shall we hang the pound &s;terling, as a common badge, about all their necks? This contains 718 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">/4 grains of pure &s;ilver. It is difficult to familiarize a new coin to the people. It is more diffi|cult to familiarize them to a new coin with an old name. Happily the dollar is familiar to them all; and is already as much referred to for a mea&s;ure of value as their re&s;|pective provincial pounds.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Tenth will be preci&s;ely the Spanish bit, or half pi&s;tereen. This is a coin familiar to us all. When we shall make a new coin th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">n equal in value to this, it will be of ready e&s;timate with the people.</P>
<P N="4">4. The hundredth, or copper, will differ little from the copper of the four Ea&s;tern &s;tates, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of a dollar; &s;till le&s;s from the penny of New York and North Caro|lina which is 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> of a dollar; and &s;omewhat more from the penny or copper of Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware and Maryland, which is 1/90 of a dollar. It will then be about
<PB N="6" REF="018541_0006_0FA7B31D08FD21D8">
the medium between the old and the new coppers of the&s;e &s;tates, and therefore will &s;oon be &s;ub&s;tituted for them both. In Virginia coppers have never been in u&s;e, It will be as ea&s;y therefore to introduce them there of one value as of another. The copper coin propo&s;ed will be nearly equal to three four hs of their penny, which is the &s;ame with the penny lawful of the Ea&s;tern &s;tates.</P>
<P>A great deal of &s;mall change is u&s;eful in a &s;tate, and tends to reduce the prices of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">mall articles. Perhaps it would not be ami&s;s to coin 3 &s;upplementory pieces of &s;ilver, one of the value of five tenths, or half a dollar, one of the value of two tenths, which would be equal to the Spanish pi&s;te|reen, and one of the value of five coppers, which would be equal to the Spanish half bit. We should then have five &s;ilver coins, viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The unit or dollar.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The half dollar or five tenths.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The double tenth, equal to .2, or &frac15; of a dollar, or to the pi&s;tereen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The tenth, equal to a Spanish bit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The five copper piece equal to .05 or 1/20 of a dollar, or to the half bit.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The plan reported by the Financier is worthy of his &s;ound judgment. It admits however of objection in the &s;ize of the unit. He propo&s;es that this shall be the 1440 th part of a dollar: &s;o that it will require 1440 of his units to make the one before propo&s;ed. He was led to adopt this by a mathematical a tention to our old currencies all of which this unit will mea&s;ure without leaving a fraction. But as our object is to get rid of the&s;e currencies, the ad|vantage derived from this coincidence will &s;oon be pa&s;t, whereas the inconveniencies of this unit will for ever re|main, if they do not altogether prevent its introduction. It is defective in two of the three requi&s;ites of a money unit.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is inconvenient in its application to the ordinary money tran&s;actions. 10,000 dollars will require 8 figures to expre&s;s them, to wit, 14,400,000 units. A hor&s;e or bullock, of 80 dollars value, will require a notation of &s;ix figures, to wit, 115,200 units. As a money of account
<PB N="7" REF="018541_0007_0FA7B31E4548E7C0">
this will be laborious, even when facilitated by the aid of decimal arithmetic: as a common mea&s;ure of the value of property, it will be too minute to be comprehended by the people The French are &s;ubjected to very laborious calculations, the livre being their ordinary money of ac|count, and this but between &frac15; and &frac16; of a dollar. But what will be our labours, should our money of account be 1/144<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">th of a dollar only?</P>
<P N="2">2. It is neither equal, nor near to any of the known coins in value.</P>
<P>If we determine that a dollar shall be our unit, we mu&s;t then &s;ay with preci&s;ion what a dollar is. This coin, as &s;truck at different times, of different weights and finene&s;s, is of different values. Sir I&s;aac Newton's a&s;&s;ay and re|pre&s;entation to the Lords of the Trea&s;ury in 1717 of tho&s;e which he examined, made their values as follows:

<P>The Financier &s;tates the old dollar as containing 376 grains of fine &s;ilver, and the new 365 grains. If the dol|lars circulating among us be of every date equally, we should examine the quantity of pure metal in each, and from them form an average for our unit. This is a work proper to be committed to Mathematicians as well as Mer|chants, and which should be decided on actual and accurate experiment.</P>
<P>The quantum of alloy is al&s;o to be decided. Some is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the coin from wearing too fa&s;t. Too much would fill our pockets with copper in&s;tead of &s;ilver. The &s;ilver coins a&s;&s;ayed by Sir I&s;aac Newton varied from 1 &frac12; to 76 penny-weight alloy in the pound Troy of mixed me|tal. The British &s;tandard has 18 dwt. The Spanish coins a&s;&s;ayed by Sir I&s;aac Newton have from 18 to 19 &frac12; dwt. The new French crown has in fact 19 &frac12;, though by edict it should have 20 dwt. that is 1/1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. The ta&s;te of our coun|trymen will require that their furniture plate should be as good as the British &s;tandard. Ta&s;te cannot be controuled
<PB N="8" REF="018541_0008_0FA7B31EF03AE898">
by law. Let it then give the law in a point which is in|different to a certain degree. Let the legi&s;latures fix the alloy of furniture plate at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">8 dwt. the British &s;tandard, and Congre&s;s that of their coin at one ounce in the pound, the French &s;tandard. This proportion has been found convenient for the alloy of gold coin, and it will &s;implify the &s;y&s;tem of our mint to alloy both metals in the &s;ame degree. The coin too being the lea&s;t pure, will be le&s;s ea&s;ily melted into plate. The&s;e rea&s;ons are light indeed, and of cour&s;e will only weigh if no heavier ones can be oppo&s;ed to them.</P>
<P>The proportion between the values of gold and &s;ilver is a mercantile problem altogether. It would be inaccu|rate to fix it by the popular exchanges of a half Joe for eight dollars, a Louis for four French crowns, or five Louis for twenty-three dollars. The fir&s;t of the&s;e would be to adopt the Spanish proportion between gold and &s;il|ver; the &s;econd the French; the third a mere popular barter, wherein convenience is con&s;ulted more than ac|curacy. The legal proportion in Spain is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">6 for 1, in England 15 &frac15; for 1, in France 15 for 1. The Spaniards and English are found in experience to retain an over-pro|portion of gold coins and to lo&s;e their &s;ilver. The French have a greater proportion of &s;ilver. The difference at market has been on the decrea&s;e. The Financier &s;tates it at pre&s;ent as at 4 &frac12; for 1. Ju&s;t principles will lead us to di&s;regard legal proportions altogether; to enquire into the market price of gold in the &s;everal countries with which we shall principally be connected in commerce, and to take an average from them. Perhaps we might with &s;afe|ty lean to a proportion &s;omewhat above par. for gold, con|&s;idering our neighbourhood and commerce with the &s;ources of the coins, and the tendency which the high price of gold in Spain has to draw thither all that of their mines, leaving the &s;ilver principally for our, and other markets.</P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible that 15 for 1, may be found an eli|gible proportion. I &s;tate it however as conjectural only.</P>
<P>As to the alloy for gold coin, the British is an ounce in the pound; the French, Spanish, and Portugue&s;e differ
<PB N="9" REF="018541_0009_0FA7B31FB71038D0">
from that only from a quarter of a grain to a grain and a half. I should therefore prefer the British, merely be|cau&s;e its fraction &s;tands in a more &s;imple form, and faci|litates the calculations into which it enters.</P>
<P>Should the unit be fixed at 365 grains of pure &s;ilver, gold at 15 for 1, and the alloy of both be one twelfth, the weights of the coins will be as follows:</P>
<P>The golden piece, containing 243 &frac13; grains of pure me|tal,&mdash;22.12 grains of alloy, will weigh 11 dwt. 1.45 grs.</P>
<P>The unit or dollar, containing 365 grs. of pure metal, 33.18 grs. of alloy, will weigh 16 dwt. 14.18 grs.</P>
<P>The half dollar, or five tenths, containing 182 &frac12; of pure metal.&mdash;16.59 grs. of alloy, will weigh 8 dwt. 7.09 grs.</P>
<P>The fifth, or pi&s;tereen, containing 73 grains of pure me|tal,&mdash;6.63 grs. of alloy, will weigh 3 dwt. 7.6<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> grs.</P>
<P>The tenth, or bit, containing 36 &frac12; grs. of pure metal,&mdash; 3.318 grs. of alloy, will weigh 1 dwt. 15 818 grs.</P>
<P>The twentieth, or half bit, containing 8 &frac14; grs. of pure metal,&mdash;1.659 grs. of alloy, will weigh 19.9 grs.</P>
<P>The quantity of fine &s;ilver which shall con&s;titute the unit being &s;ettled, and the proportion of the value of gold to that of &s;ilver; a table should be formed from the a&s;&s;ay before &s;ugge&s;ted, cla&s;&s;ing the &s;everal foreign coins accord|ing to their finene&s;s, declaring the worth of a penny-weight or grain in each cla&s;s, and that they shall be law|ful tenders at tho&s;e rates, if not clipped or otherwi&s;e di|minished; and where diminished, offering their value for them at the mint, deducting the expence of re-coinage. Here the legi&s;latures should co-operate with Congre&s;s in providing that no money be received or paid at their trea|&s;uries, or by any of their officers, or any bank, but on actual weight; in making it criminal in a high degree to diminish their own coins, and in &s;ome &s;maller degree to offer them in payment when diminished.</P>
<P>That this &s;ubject may be properly prepared and in rea|dine&s;s for Congre&s;s to take up at their meeting in No|vember, &s;omething mu&s;t now be done. The pre&s;ent &s;e&s;|&s;ion drawing to a clo&s;e, they probably would not chu&s;e to enter far into this undertaking them&s;elves. The com|mittee

<HEAD>Supplementory Explanations.</HEAD>
<P>THE preceding notes having been &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of the Financier, he favored me with his opinion and ob&s;ervations on them, which render nece&s;|&s;ary the following &s;upplementory explanations.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved in the preceding notes, that the true propor|tion of value between gold and &s;ilver was a mercantile problem altogether, and that perhaps 15 for 1 might be found an eligible proportion. The Financier is &s;o good as to inform me, that this would be higher than the mar|ket would ju&s;tify, Confident of his better information on this &s;ubject, I recede from that idea.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a New&s;paper, which frequently gives good details in politi|cal oeconomy, I find, under the Hamburgh head, that the pre&s;ent market price of gold and &s;ilver, is, in England 15.5 for 1: in Ru&s;|&s;ia 15: in Holland 14.75: in Savoy 14.6: in France 14.42: in Spain 14.3: in Germany 14 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">55. The average of which is 14.675 or 14 5 8ths. I would &s;till incline to give a l&icirc;ttle more than the market price for gold, becau&s;e of its &s;uperior convenience in tran&s;portation.</NOTE></P>
<P>He al&s;o informs me, that the &s;everal coins in circula|tion among us have been already a&s;&s;ayed with accuracy,
<PB N="12" REF="018541_0012_0FA7B32241DB7AA8">
and the re&s;ult published in a work on that &s;ubject. The a&s;&s;ay of Sir I&s;aac Newton had &s;uper&s;eded, in my mind, the nece&s;&s;ity of this operation as to the older coins, which were the &s;ubject of his examination. This latter work, with equal rea&s;on, may be con&s;idered as &s;aving the &s;ame trouble as to the latter coins.</P>
<P>So far then I accede to the opinions of the Financier. On the other hand, he &s;eems to concur with me in think|ing his &s;malle&s;t fractional divi&s;ion too minute for an unit, and therefore propo&s;es to transfer that denomination to his large&s;t &s;ilver coin, containing 1000 of the units fir&s;t propo&s;ed, and worth about 4<HI>&s;</HI>2 lawful, or 25/<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">6 of a dollar. The only que&s;tion then remaining between us, is whether the dollar, or this coin, be be&s;t for the unit. We both agree that the <HI>ea&s;e of adoption with the people</HI> is the thing to be aimed at.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the dollar, events have overtaken and &s;uper|ceded the que&s;tion. It is no longer a doubt whether the peo|ple can adopt it with ea&s;e. They have actually adopted it, and will be to be turned out of that into another tract of calculation, if another unit be a&s;&s;umed. They have now two units, which they u&s;e with equal facility, viz. the pound of their re&s;pective &s;tate, and the dollar. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is peculiar to each &s;tate: the &s;econd happily common to all. In each &s;tate the people have an ea&s;y rule for converting the pound of their &s;tate into dollars, or dollars into pounds. And this is enough for them with|out knowing how this may be done in every &s;tate of the union. Such of them as live near enough the borders of their &s;tate to have dealings with their neighbours, learn al&s;o the rule of their neighbours. Thus in Virginia, and the Ea&s;tern &s;tates, where the dollar is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"><HI>&s;</HI> or 3/<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">0 of a pound, to turn pounds into dollars, they multiply by 10 and di|vide by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> to turn dollars into pounds, they multiply by 3 and divide by ten. Tho&s;e in Virginia who live near to Carolina, where the dollar is 8<HI>&s;</HI> or 4/10 of a pound, learn the operation of that &s;tate, which is a multiplication by 4, and divi&s;ion by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">0, et e conver&s;o. Tho&s;e who live near Maryland, where the dollar is 7<HI>&s;</HI>6 or 3/8 of a pound, multi|ply
<PB N="13" REF="018541_0013_0FA7B327B377A4D8">
by 3 and divide by 8, or e conver&s;o. All the&s;e ope|rations are ea&s;y, and have been found by experience not too much for the arithmetic of the people, when they have occa&s;ion to convert their old unit into dollars, or the rever&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the unit of the Financier, in the &s;tates where the dollar is 3/10 of a pound, this unit will be 5/24. Its con|ver&s;ion into the pound then will be by a multiplication by 5 and divi&s;ion by 24. In the &s;tates where the dollar is 3/8 of a pound, this unit will be 25/96 of a pound, and the ope|ration mu&s;t be to multiply by 25 and divide by 96, or e con|ver&s;o. Where the dollar is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">/10 of a pound, this unit will be 5/18. The &s;implicity of the fraction, and of cour&s;e the facility of conver&s;ion and reconver&s;ion, is therefore again&s;t this unit, and in favour of the dollar, in every in&s;tance. The only advantage it has over the dollar is, that it will in every ca&s;e expre&s;s our farthings without a remainder; whereas, though the dollar and its decimals will do this in many ca&s;es, it will not in all. But, even in the&s;e, by extending your notation one figure further, to wit, to thou&s;andths, you approximate to perfect accuracy within le&s;s than the two thou&s;andah part of a dollar, an atom in money which every one would neglect. Again&s;t this &s;ingle inconvenience the other advantages of the dollar are more than &s;ufficient to preponderat&eacute;.&mdash;This unit will pre&s;ent to the people a new coin, and whether they en|deavour to e&s;timate its value by comparing it with a pound, or with a dollar, the units they now po&s;&s;e&s;s, they will find the fraction very compound, and of cour&s;e le&s;s accommodated to their comprehen&s;ion and habits than the dollar. Indeed the probability is that they could never be led to compute in it generally.</P>
<P>The Financier &s;uppo&s;es that the 1/100 of a dollar is not &s;ufficiently &s;mall where the poor are purcha&s;ers or ven|ders. If it is not, make a &s;maller coin. But I &s;u&s;pect that it is &s;mall enough. Let us examine facts, in coun|tries where we are acquainted with them. In Virginia, where our towns are few, &s;mall, and of cour&s;e their de|mand for nece&s;&s;aries very limited, we have never yet been
<PB N="14" REF="018541_0014_0FA7B328E935FCE0">
able to introduce a copper coin at all. The &s;malle&s;t coin which any body will receive there is the half bit, or 1/20 of a dollar. In tho&s;e &s;tates where the towns are larger and more populous, a more habitual barter for &s;mall wants has called for a copper coin 1/90 or 1/9<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> or 1/108 of a dollar. In England where the towns are many and populous, and where ages of experience have matured the conveniencies of intercour&s;e, they have found that &s;ome wants may be &s;upplied for a farthing, or 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">0<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a dollar, and they have accommodated a coin to this want. This bu&s;ine&s;s is evi|dently progre&s;&s;ive. In Virginia we are far behind. In &s;ome o her &s;tates they are farther advanced, to wit, to the appreciation of 1/90, 1/9<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, 1/108 of a dollar To this mo&s;t advanced &s;tate then I accommodated my &s;malle&s;t coin in the decimal arrangement as a <HI>money of payment,</HI> cor|re&s;ponding with the <HI>money of account.</HI> I have no doubt the time will come when a &s;maller coin will be called for. When it comes, let it be made. It will probably be the half of the copper I propo&s;e, that is to &s;ay 5/<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">00 or .005 of a dollar, this being nearly the farthing of Eng|land. But it will be time enough to make it when the people shall be ready to receive it.</P>
<P>My propo&s;ition then is that our notation of money shall be decimal, de&s;cending ad libitum of the per&s;on noting; that the unit of this notation shall be a dollar, that coins shall be accommodated to it from ten dollars to the hun|dredth of a dollar; and that to &s;et this on foot, the re&s;o|lutions be adopted which were propo&s;ed in the Notes, on|ly &s;ub&s;tituting an <HI>enquiry into the finene&s;s of the coins,</HI> in lieu of <HI>an a&s;&s;ay</HI> of them.</P>
