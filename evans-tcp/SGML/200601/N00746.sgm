<P>THE one half at lea&s;t of the in|&s;pired writings is <HI>Hi&s;torical</HI>: not as if the Spirit of God had no farther aim therein, than to acquaint us with ancient <HI>Chronology,</HI> or to re&s;erve for us the monuments of antiquity, and tho&s;e renowned names, which

<P>That <HI>Solomon,</HI> to who&s;e Hi&s;tory our <HI>Text</HI> be|longs, was a <HI>Type of Christ,</HI> is too manife&s;t to need any digre&s;&s;ion for the proof of it: though all things written in his Life cannot with rea|&s;on be reckoned <HI>Typical.</HI> That wherein God more peculiarly cho&s;e <HI>Solomon</HI> to repre&s;ent <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> was his <HI>Kingly Office:</HI> for which end he furni&s;hed him with Wealth, Honour, and Wi&s;|dom &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all the Monarchs, which ever had been, or &s;hould be.

<P>The Religion revealed by God to fallen man forbids it not to him, but approveth of it.

<PB N="12" REF="000900_0011_0FAC98BFA2BC5968">
of Sinners, and that is by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> Acts 4.22. <HI>there is Salvation in no other.</HI> The <HI>Moral Law</HI> was renewed upon <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> and <HI>given in the hand of a Mediator,</HI> to be a Rule of Obedsence to the Worlds End unchangeably: nor did <HI>Chri&s;t come to de&s;troy it</HI>; nay, he hath a&s;&s;ured us, that he will not &s;uffer <HI>one jot or tittle of it to fail,</HI> Mat. 5.17, 18. If then the <HI>Moral Law</HI> doth not condemn War, but pre&s;cribe to it; and that Law be a <HI>Rule</HI> for <HI>Christians,</HI> as it certainly is, <HI>Christ</HI> did not prohibit it, though he forbad private re|venge for per&s;onal injuries: which yet was no addition to the Law of Nature, or Law Mo|ral, but only an interpretation of it, and a vin|dicating it from the fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es of corrupt men.</P>
<P>Nor indeed can the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> be o|therwi&s;e defended or &s;ecured again&s;t the inva|ders and oppre&s;&s;ors of it, who are <HI>unrea&s;onable men,</HI> and can be no other way di&s;puted, but at the Swords point, and Canons mouth; and if at any time War proves detrimental to the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t, the fault is in the men, not in the Profe&s;&s;ion. When the <HI>Souldiers</HI> came to the <HI>Babtist</HI> for advice, he doth not ca&s;hier them, nor advi&s;e them to disband, but directs them how to manage their Calling becoming|ly, Luk. 3.14 <HI>Do violence to no man, neither ac|cu&s;e any fal&s;ly, and be content with your Wages</HI>;

and that Calling which the Word of God un|dertakes to regulate, mu&s;t needs have its appro|bation. Nor would Chri&s;t have warned us in the Go&s;pel of Wars to be expected, if he had not reckoned it our duty to prepare for them; nor have advi&s;ed us rather to Sell our Coat than not to have a Sword, if he had thought it unlawful to u&s;e it when we have it; as he doth. <HI>Luk.</HI> 22.36. <HI>He that hath no Sword, let him Sell his gar|ment and buy one.</HI> This expen&s;e would be alto|together &s;uperfluous, if <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> taught us to hold up our throats to every one that offers to cut them.</P>
<P><HI>Self Pre&s;ervation</HI> is a principle &s;tamped on the nature of Second beings. <HI>Inanimates</HI> have it by an innate quality put into them; <HI>Sen&s;itive Crea|tures</HI> have it by in&s;tinct, and their very natures are furni&s;hed for it: and that rea&s;on &s;hould not fortify this principle in men; or that Religion &s;hould contradict any maxime of the Law of na|ture is unintelligible. Certainly then, they who pretend to make it a &s;in in a Chri&s;tian to u&s;e Arms, do it in policy, &s;eeking to bind mens hands, or, which is as bad, their <HI>Con&s;ciences,</HI> that they may en&s;lave or &s;lay them without re&s;i&s;tance.
