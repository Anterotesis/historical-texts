<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to the order of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, of Janu|ary <HI>15</HI>th, I have now the honor to inclo&s;e you a <HI>REPORT</HI> on the &s;ubject of <HI>MEASURES, WEIGHTS,</HI> and <HI>COINS.</HI> The length of time which intervened be|tween the date of the order and my arrival in this city, prevented my receiving it till the <HI>15</HI>th of April; and an illne&s;s which followed &s;oon after, added, unavoid|ably, &s;ome weeks to the delay; &s;o that it was not till about the <HI>20</HI>th of May that I was able to fini&s;h the Report. A de&s;ire to le&s;&s;en the number if its imperfections, induced me &s;till to withhold it awhile, till, on the <HI>15</HI>th of June, came to my hands, from Paris, a printed copy of a propo&s;ition made by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>AUTUN,</HI> to the National A&s;&s;embly of France, on the &s;ubject of Weights and Mea&s;ures; and three days afterwards I received through the channel of the public papers, the &s;peech of <HI>Sir JOHN RIGGS MILLER,</HI> of April <HI>13</HI>th, in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, on the &s;ame &s;ubject. In the report which I had prepared, and was then about to give in, I had propo&s;ed the latitude of <HI>38&deg;,</HI> as that which &s;hould fix our &s;tandard, becau&s;e it was the medium latitude of the United States; but the propo&s;ition be|fore the National A&s;&s;embly of France, to take that of <HI>45&deg;</HI> as being a middle term between the Equator and both Poles, and a term which might con&s;equently unite the nations of both hemi&s;pheres, appeared to me &s;o well cho&s;en, and &s;o ju&s;t, that I did not he&s;itate a moment to prefer it to that of <HI>38&deg;.</HI> It became nece&s;&s;ary of cour&s;e to reform all my calculations to that &s;tandard; an operation which has been retarded by my other occupations.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances will, I hope, apologize for the delay which has attended the execution of the order of the Hou&s;e: And, perhaps, a di&s;po&s;ition on their part, to have due regard to the proceedings of other nations, engaged on the &s;ame &s;ub|ject, may induce them &s;till to defer deciding ultimately on it till their next &s;e&s;&s;ion. Should this be the ca&s;e, and &s;hould any new matter occur in the mean time, I &s;hall think it my duty to communicate it to the Hou&s;e, as &s;upplemental to the pre&s;ent Report.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>SECRETARY OF STATE,</HI> to whom was referred, by the <HI>HOUSE OF REPRE|SENTATIVES,</HI> to prepare and report a proper Plan or Plans for e&s;tabli&s;hing Uniformity in the <HI>CURRENCY, WEIGHTS</HI> and <HI>MEASURES</HI> of the United States, in obedience thereto, makes the following REPORT:</HEAD>
<P>TO obtain uniformity in Mea&s;ures, Weights and Coins, it is nece&s;&s;ary to find &s;ome mea&s;ure of invariable length, with which, as a &s;tandard, they may be compared.</P>
<P>There exi&s;ts not in nature as far as has been hitherto ob&s;erved, a &s;ingle &s;ubject or &s;pecies of &s;ubject, acce&s;&s;ible to man, which pre&s;ents one con&s;tant and uniform dimen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The globe of the earth it&s;elf, indeed, might be con&s;idered as invariable in all its dimen&s;ions, and that its circumference would furni&s;h an invariable mea&s;ure; but no one of its circles, great or &s;mall, is acce&s;&s;ible to admea&s;ure|ment through all its parts; and the various trials to mea&s;ure definite portions of them, have been of &s;uch various re&s;ult, as to &s;hew there is no de|pendance on that operation for certainty.</P>
<P>MATTER then, by its mere exten&s;ion, furni&s;hing nothing invariable, its MOTION is the only remaining re&s;ource.</P>
<P>The motion of the earth round its axis, though not ab&s;olutely uniform and invariable, may be con&s;idered as &s;uch for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">uman purpo&s;e. It is mea&s;ured obviou&s;ly, but unequally, by the departure of a given meridian from the &s;un, and its return to it, con&s;tituting a &s;olar day. Throwing to|gether the inequalities of &s;olar days, a mean interval, or day, has been found, and divided, by very general con&s;ent, into 86,400 equal parts.</P>
<P>A Pendulum, vibrating freely, in &s;mall and equal area, may be &s;o adju&s;ted in its length, as, by its vibrations, to make this divi&s;ion of the earth's mo|tion into 86,400 equal parts, called &s;econds of mean time.</P>
<P>Such a Pendulum then, becomes it&s;elf a mea&s;ure of determinate length, to which all others may be referred, as to a &s;tandard.</P>
<P>But even the Pendulum is not without its uncertainties.</P>
<P N="1">1. The difficulty of a&s;certaining, in practice, its center of o&s;cillation, as depending on the form of the bob, and its di&s;tance from the point of &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion; the effect of the weight of the &s;u&s;pending wire towards di&s;placing the center of o&s;cillation; that center being &s;eated within the body of the bob, and therefore inacce&s;&s;ible to the mea&s;ure, are &s;ources of con&s;iderable uncertainty.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="022994_0005_0FBAD73675FAD900">2. Both theory and experience prove, that to pre&s;erve its i&s;ochroni&s;m, it mu&s;t be &s;horter towards the equator, and longer towards the poles.</P>
<P N="3">3. The height of the &s;ituation above the common level, as being an increment to the radius of the earth, dimini&s;hes the length of the Pendulum.</P>
<P N="4">4. The pendulum being made of metal, as is be&s;t, it varies its length with the variations in the temperature of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P N="5">5. To continue &s;mall and equal vibrations, through a &s;ufficient length of time, and to count the&s;e vibrations, machinery and a power are nece&s;&s;ary, which may exert a &s;mall, but con&s;tant effort to renew the wa&s;te of motion: And the difficulty is, &s;o to apply the&s;e, as that they &s;hall neither retard nor accelerate the vibrations.</P>
<P N="1">1. In order to avoid the uncertainties which re&s;pect the center of o&s;cilla|tion, it has been propo&s;ed by Mr. Le&s;lie, an ingenious arti&s;t of Philadelphia, to &s;ub&s;titute, for the pendulum, an uniform cylindrical rod, without a bob.</P>
<P>Could the diameter of &s;uch a rod be infinitely &s;mall, the center of o&s;cilla|tion would be exactly at two thirds of the whole length, mea&s;ured from the point of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. Giving it a diameter which &s;hall render it &s;ufficiently inflexible, the center will be di&s;placed, indeed; but, in a &s;econd rod not the (1.) 600,000th part of its length, and not the hundredth part as much as in a &s;econd pendulum, with a &s;pherical bob of proper diameter. This di&s;placement is &s;o infinitely minute then, that we may con&s;ider the center of o&s;cillation, for all practical purpo&s;es, as re&s;iding at two thirds of the length, from the center of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. The di&s;tance between the&s;e two cen|ters might be ea&s;ily and accurately a&s;certained in practice. But the whole rod is better for a &s;tandard, than any portion of it, becau&s;e &s;en&s;ibly defined at both its extremities.</P>
<P N="2">2. The uncertainty ari&s;ing from the difference of length requi&s;ite for the &s;econd pendulum, or the &s;econd rod, in different latitudes, may be avoided by fixing on &s;ome one latitude, to which our &s;tandard &s;hall refer. That of 38&deg;, as being the middle latitude of the United States, might &s;eem the mo&s;t convenient, were we to con&s;ider our&s;elves alone; but connected with other nations by commerce and &s;cience, it is better to fix on that parallel which bids faire&s;t to be adopted by them al&s;o. The 45th, as being the middle term between the equator and pole, has been heretofore propo&s;ed in Europe; and the propo&s;ition has been lately renewed there, under circum&s;tances which may very po&s;&s;ibly give it &s;ome effect. This parallel is di&s;tingui&s;hed with us al&s;o, as forming our principal northern boundary. Let the com|pletion of the 45th degree, then, give the &s;tandard for our union, with the hope that it may become a line of union with the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>The difference between the &s;econd rod for 45&deg; of latitude, and that for 31&deg;, our other extreme, is to be examined.</P>
<P>The &s;econd <HI>pendulum</HI> for 45&deg; of latitude, according to Sir I&s;aac Newton's computation, mu&s;t be of (2.) 39.14912 inches Engli&s;h mea&s;ure; and a <HI>rod,</HI> to vibrate in the &s;ame time, mu&s;t be of the &s;ame length between the centers
<PB N="9" REF="022994_0006_0FBAD738ABF9FEE0">
of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion and o&s;cillation, and con&s;equently its whole length 58.7 (or more exactly 58.72368) inches. This is longer than the rod which &s;hall vibrate &s;econds in 31&deg; of latitude, by about 1/670 part of its whole length; a difference &s;o minute that it might be neglected, as in&s;en&s;ible, for the com|mon purpo&s;es of life: But in ca&s;es requiring perfect exactne&s;s, the &s;econd rod, found by trial of its vibrations in any part of the United States, may be corrected by computation for the (3.) latitude of the place, and &s;o brought exactly to the &s;tandard of 45&deg;.</P>
<P N="3">3. By making the experiment in the level of the ocean, the difference will be avoided, which a higher po&s;ition might occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="4">4. The expan&s;ion and contraction of the rod with the change of tem|perature, is the fourth &s;ource of uncertainty before mentioned. According to the high authority &s;o often quoted, an iron rod, of given length, may vary, between &s;ummer and winter, in temperate latitudes, and in the com|mon expo&s;ure of hou&s;e clocks, from 1/1728 to 1/2592 of its whole length, which, in a rod of 58.7 inches, will be from about two to three hundredths of an inch. This may be avoided by adju&s;ting and pre&s;erving the &s;tandard in a cellar, or other place, the temperature of which never varies. Iron is named for this purpo&s;e, becau&s;e the lea&s;t expan&s;ible of the metals.</P>
<P N="5">5. The practical difficulty re&s;ulting from the effect of the machinery and moving power, is very incon&s;iderable in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the arts; and, in their progre&s;s towards perfection, will become le&s;s and le&s;s. To e&s;timate and obviate this, will be the arti&s;t's province. It is as nothing when com|pared with the &s;ources of inaccuracy hitherto attending mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Before quitting the &s;ubject of the inconveniencies, &s;ome of which attend the pendulum alone, others both the pendulum and rod, it mu&s;t be added that the rod would have an accidental, but very precious advantage over the pendulum in this country, in the event of our fixing the foot at the neare&s;t aliquot part of either; for the difference between the common foot and tho&s;e &s;o to be deduced, would be three times greater in the ca&s;e of the pendulum, than in that of the rod.</P>
<P>Let the &s;tandard of mea&s;ure then be an uniform cylindrical rod of iron, of &s;uch length, as, in latitude 45&deg;, in the level of the ocean, and in a cellar, or other place, the temperature of which does not vary through the year, &s;hall perform its vibrations, in &s;mall and equal ares, in one &s;econd of mean time.</P>
<P>A &s;tandard of invariable length being thus obtained, we may proceed to identify, by that, the Mea&s;ures, Weights and Coins of the United States: But here a doubt pre&s;ents it&s;elf, as to the extent of the reformation meditated by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. The experiment made by Congre&s;s in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty-&s;ix, by declaring that there &s;hould be one money of account and payment through the United States, and that its parts and multiples &s;hould be in a decimal ratio, has obtained &s;uch general approbation, both at home and abroad, that nothing &s;eems wanting, but the actual coinage, to bani&s;h the di&s;cordant pounds, &s;hillings, pence, and farthings of the different States, and &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h in their &s;tead,
<PB N="10" REF="022994_0007_0FBAD73A643B44C0">
the new denominations. Is it in contemplation with the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives to extend a like improvement to our Mea&s;ures and Weights, and to arrange them al&s;o in a decimal ratio? The facility which this would in|troduce into the vulgar arithmetic, would, unque&s;tionably, be &s;oon and &s;en|&s;ibly felt by the whole ma&s;s of the people, who would thereby be enabled to compute for them&s;elves whatever they &s;hould have occa&s;ion to buy, to &s;ell, or m mea&s;ure, which the pre&s;ent complicated and difficult ratios place beyond their computation, for the mo&s;t part. Or, is it the opinion of the Repre&s;entatives that the difficulty of changing the e&s;tabli&s;hed habits of a whole nation oppo&s;es an in&s;uperable bar to this improvement? Under this uncertainty the Secretary of State thinks it his duty to &s;ubmit alternative plans, that the Hou&s;e may, at their will, adopt either the one or the other, exclu&s;ively, or the one for the pre&s;ent, and the other for a future time, when the public mind may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have become familiarized to it.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="system">

<P>And fir&s;t, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the pre&s;ent Mea&s;ures and Weights, are to be retained, but to be rendered uniform and invariable, by bringing them to the &s;ame invariable &s;tandard.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the&s;e States, having come chiefly from England, brought with them the Mea&s;ures and Weights of that country. The&s;e alone are ge|nerally e&s;tabli&s;hed among us, either by law or u&s;age, and the&s;e, therefore, are alone to be retained and fixed. We mu&s;t re&s;ort to that country for information of what they are, or ought to be.</P>
<P>This re&s;ts, principally, on the evidence of certain &s;tandard Mea&s;ures and Weights, which have been pre&s;erved, of long time in different depo&s;its. But differences among the&s;e having been known to exi&s;t, the Hou&s;e of Commons, in the years 1757 and 1758, appointed committees to inquire into the ori|ginal &s;tandards of their weights and mea&s;ures. The&s;e committees, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by able mathematicians and arti&s;ts, examined and compared with each other the &s;everal &s;tandard mea&s;ures and weights, and made reports on them in the years 1758 and 1759. The circum&s;tances under which the&s;e reports were made, entitle them to be con&s;idered, as far as they go, as the be&s;t written te&s;timony exi&s;ting, of the &s;tandard mea&s;ures and weights of England; and as &s;uch, they will be relied on in the progre&s;s of this report.</P>

their divi&s;ions not exact, and the rods bent: and that in the year 1742, &s;ome members of the Royal Society had been at great pains in taking an exact mea&s;ure of the&s;e &s;tandards, by very curious in&s;truments, prepared by the ingenious Mr. Graham; that the Royal Society had had a bra&s;s rod made pur&s;uant to their experiments, which was made &s;o accurately, and by per&s;ons &s;o &s;kilful and exact, that it was thought not ea&s;y to obtain a more exact one; and the committee in fact found it to agree with the &s;tandards at the exchequer, as near as it was po&s;&s;ible. They furni&s;h no means, to per&s;ons at a di&s;tance, of knowing what this &s;tandard is.

<P>The Secretary of State is not informed whether there have been any and what alterations of the&s;e mea&s;ures, by the laws of the particular States.</P>
<P>It is propo&s;ed to retain this &s;eries of mea&s;ures, but to fix the gallon to one determinate capacity, as the unit of mea&s;ure, both wet and dry; for convenience is in &s;avour of aboli&s;hing the di&s;tinction even between wet and dry mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The wine gallon, whether of 224 or 231 cubic inches, may be altogether di&s;regarded, as concerning, principally, the mercantile, and the wealthy, the lea&s;t numerous part of the &s;ociety, and the mo&s;t capable of reducing one mea&s;ure to another by calculation. This gallon is little u&s;ed among the ma&s;s of farmers, who&s;e chief habits and intere&s;ts are in the &s;ize of the corn bu&s;hel.</P>
<P>Of the &s;tandard mea&s;ures before &s;tated, two are principally di&s;tingui&s;hed in authority and practice. The &s;tatute bu&s;hel of 2150 cubic inches, which gives a gallon of 268.75 cubic inches, and the &s;tandard gallon of 1601, called the corn gallon of 271, or 272 cubic inches, which has introduced the mercantile bu&s;hel of 2176 inches. The former of the&s;e is mo&s;t u&s;ed in &s;ome of the grain &s;tates, the latter in others. The middle term of 270 cubic inches may be taken as a mutual compromi&s;e of convenience, and as offer|ing this general advantage, that the bu&s;hel being of 2160 cubic inches, is exactly a cubic foot and a quarter, and &s;o facilitates the conver&s;ion of wet and dry mea&s;ures into &s;olid contents and tonnage, and &s;implifies the con|nection of mea&s;ures and weights, as will be &s;hewn hereafter. It may be added in favour of this, as a medium mea&s;ure, that eight of the &s;tandard or &s;tatute mea&s;ures before enumerated, are below this term, and nine above it.</P>

<P>There are two &s;eries of weights in u&s;e among us; the one called Avoir|dupois, the other Troy.</P>

<ITEM>The Dram into 3 &s;cruples;</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Scruple into 20 grains.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>According to the &s;ubdivi&s;ion for gold and &s;ilver, the ounce is divided into 20 penny-weight; and the penny-weight into 24 grains.</P>
<P>So that the pound Troy contains 5760 grains, of which 7,000 are requi|&s;ite to make the pound Avoirdupois; of cour&s;e the weight of the pound Troy, is to that of the pound Avoirdupois, as 5760 to 7,000, or, as 144 to 175.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that this is exactly the proportion of the ancient liquid gallon of Guildhall of 224 cubic inches, to the corn gallon of 272; for 224 are to 272, as 144 to 175. (4.)</P>
<P>It is further remarkable &s;till, that this is al&s;o the exact proportion be|tween the &s;pecific weight of any mea&s;ure of wheat, and of the &s;ame mea&s;ure of water. For the &s;tatute bu&s;hel is of 64 pounds of wheat. Now as 144 to 175, &s;o are 64<ABBR>lb.</ABBR> to 77.7<ABBR>lb.</ABBR> but 77.7<ABBR>lb.</ABBR> is known to be the weight of (5.) 2150.4 cubic inches of pure water; which is exactly the content of the Winche&s;ter bu&s;hel, as declared by the &s;tatute 13.14. W. 3. That &s;tatute determined the bu&s;hel to be a cylinder of 18<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> inches diameter, and 8 inches depth. Such a cylinder, as nearly as it can be cubed, and expre&s;&s;ed in
<PB N="15" REF="022994_0012_0FBAD74377175138">
figures, contains 2150.425 cubic inches: a re&s;ult which reflects authority on the declaration of Parliament, and induces a favorable opinion of the care with which they inve&s;tigated the contents of the ancient bu&s;hel, and al&s;o a belief that there might exi&s;t evidence of it at that day, unknown to the committees of 1758, and 1759.</P>
<P>We find then in a continued proportion 64 to 77.7 as 224 to 272, and as 144 to 175, that is to &s;ay, the &s;pecific weight of a mea&s;ure of wheat, to that of the &s;ame mea&s;ure of water, as the cubic contents of the wet-gallon, to tho&s;e of the dry; and as the weight of a pound Troy to that of a pound Avoirdupois.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to have been &s;o combined as to render it indifferent whether a thing were dealt out by weight or mea&s;ure, for the dry gallon of wheat, and the liquid one of wine were of the &s;ame weight; and the Avoirdupois pound of wheat, and the Troy pound of wine, were of the &s;ame mea&s;ure. Water and the vinous liquors, which enter mo&s;t into commerce, are &s;o nearly of a weight, that the difference, in moderate quantities, would be neglected by both buyer and &s;eller; &s;ome of the wines being a little heavier, and &s;ome a little lighter than water.</P>
<P>Another remarkable corre&s;pondence, is, that between weights and mea|&s;ures. For 1000 ounces avoirdupois of pure water, fill a cubic foot, with mathematical exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>What circum&s;tances of the times or purpo&s;es of barter, or commerce, called for this combination of weights and mea&s;ures, with the &s;ubjects to be exchanged or purcha&s;ed, are not now to be a&s;certained. But a triple &s;et of exact proportionals repre&s;enting weights, mea&s;ures, and the things to be weighed and mea&s;ured, and a relation &s;o integral between weights and &s;olid mea&s;ures, mu&s;t have been the re&s;ult of de&s;ign and &s;cientific calculation, and not a mere coincidence of hazard. It proves that the dry, and wet mea&s;ures, the heavy and light weights, mu&s;t have been original parts of the &s;y&s;tem they compo&s;e: Contrary to the opinion of the committee of 1757&mdash;1758, who thought that the avoirdupois weight was not an ancient weight of the king|dom, nor ever even a legal weight, but during a &s;ingle year of the reign of H. 8. and therefore, concluded, otherwi&s;e than will be here propo&s;ed, to &s;uppre&s;s it altogether. Their opinion was founded chiefly on the &s;ilence of the laws, as to this weight. But the harmony here developed in the &s;y&s;|tem of weights and mea&s;ures, of which the avoirdupois makes an e&s;&s;ential member, corroborated by a general u&s;e, from very high antiquity, of that, or of a nearly &s;imilar weight under another (6.) name, &s;eem &s;tronger proofs that this is a legal weight, than the mere &s;ilence of the written laws is of the contrary.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, it is in &s;uch general u&s;e with us, that, on the principle of popular convenience, it's higher denominations, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t be pre|&s;erved. It is by the avoirdupois pound and ounce that our citizens have been u&s;ed to buy and &s;ell. But the &s;maller &s;ubdivi&s;ions of drams and quarters, are not in u&s;e with them. On the other hand, they have been u&s;ed to weigh their money and medicine with the penny-weights and grains troy-weight, and are not in the habit of u&s;ing the pounds and ounces of that &s;e|ries. It would be for their convenience, then, to &s;uppre&s;s the pound and
<PB N="16" REF="022994_0013_0FBAD7456A01A1B0">
ounce troy, and the dram and quarter avoirdupois; and to form into one &s;eries the avoirdupois pound and ounce, and the troy penny-weight and grain. The avoirdupois ounce contains 18 penny-weight 5 &frac12; grains troy-weight. Divide it then into&punc; 18 penny-weight, and the penny-weight, as heretofore, into 24 grains, and the new penny-weight will contain between a third and a quarter of a grain more than the pre&s;ent troy penny-weight; or, more accurately, it will be to that, as 875 to 864, a difference not to be noticed, either in money or medicine, below the denomination of an ounce.</P>
<P>But it will be nece&s;&s;ary to refer the&s;e weights to a determinate ma&s;s of &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;pecific gravity of which is invariable. Rain-water is &s;uch a &s;ub&s;tance, and may be referred to every where, and through all time. It has been found by accurate experiments, that a cubic foot of rain-water weighs 1000 ounces Avoirdupois, &s;tandard weights of the Exchequer. It is true that among the&s;e &s;tandard weights, the committee reports &s;mall va|riations; but this experiment mu&s;t decide in favour of tho&s;e particular weights, between which and an integral ma&s;s of water, &s;o remarkable a coincidence has been found. To render this &s;tandard more exact, the water &s;hould be weighed always in the &s;ame temperature of air, as heat, by increa&s;ing it's volume, le&s;&s;ens it's &s;pecific gravity. The cellar of uniform temperature, is be&s;t for this al&s;o.</P>
<P>Let it, then, be e&s;tabli&s;hed that an ounce is of the weight of a cube of rain-water, of one tenth of a foot, or rather, that it is the thou&s;andth part of the weight of a cubic foot of rain-water, weighed in the &s;tandard tem|perature: that the &s;eries of weights of the United States &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of pounds, ounces, penny-weights, and grains; whereof

<P>Congre&s;s in 1786 e&s;tabli&s;hed the money unit at 375.64 troy grains of pure &s;ilver. It is propo&s;ed to enlarge this by about the third of a grain, in weight, or a mill, in value; that is to &s;ay, to e&s;tabli&s;h it at 376 (or more exactly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">76.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">2985) in&s;tead of 375.64 grains, becau&s;e it will be &s;hewn, that this, as the unit of coin, will link in &s;y&s;tem with the units of length, &s;ur|face, capacity, and weight, whenever it &s;hall be thought proper to extend the decimal ratio through all the&s;e branches. It is to pre&s;erve the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of doing this, that this very minute alteration is propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>We have this proportion then, 875 to 864 as 376.02985 grains troy to 371.30261, the expre&s;&s;ion of the unit in the new grains.</P>
<P>Let it be declared, therefore, that the money unit, or dollar of the Uni|ted States, &s;hall contain 371.3 American grains of pure &s;ilver.</P>
<P>If nothing more then, is propo&s;ed than to render uniform and &s;table the &s;y&s;tem we already po&s;&s;e&s;s, this may be effected on the plan herein detailed; the &s;um of which is, 1. That the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures of length be retained, and fixed by an invariable &s;tandard: 2. That the mea&s;ures of &s;urface re|main

as they are, and be invariable al&s;o as the mea&s;ures of length to which they are to refer: 3. That the unit of capacity, now &s;o equivocal, be &s;ettled at a medium and convenient term, and defined by the &s;ame invariable mea|&s;ures of length: 4. That the more known terms in the two kinds of weights be retained, and reduced to one &s;eries, and that they be referred to a defi|nite ma&s;s of &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;pecific gravity of which never changes: And 5. That the quantity of pure &s;ilver in the money unit be expre&s;&s;ed in parts of the weights &s;o defined.</P>
<P>In the whole of this no change is propo&s;ed, except an in&s;en&s;ible one in the troy grain and penny-weight, and the very minute one in the money unit.</P>

<P>But if it be thought that, either now, or at any future time, the citizens of the United States may be induced to undertake a thorough reformation of their whole &s;y&s;tem of Mea&s;ures, Weights and Coins, reducing every branch to the &s;ame decimal ratio already e&s;tabli&s;hed in their Coins, and thus bringing the calculation of the principal affairs of life within the arith|metic of every man who can multiply and divide plain numbers, greater changes will be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P N="2">(2.) Sir I&s;aac Newton computes the pendulum for 45&deg; to be 36 pouces 8.428 lignes. Picard made the Engli&s;h foot 11 pouces 2.6 lignes, and Dr. Ma&s;kelyne 11 pouces 3.11 lignes. D'Alembert &s;tates it at 11 pouces 3 lignes, which has been u&s;ed in the&s;e calculations as a middle term, and gives us Pouces / 36 Lignes./8<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">428 &equals; 39.1491 inches. This length for the pendulum of 45&deg; had been adopted in this report before the Bi&s;hop of Autun's propo&s;ition was known here. He relies on Mairan's ratio for the length of the pendulum in the latitude of Paris, to wit, 504:257&proportion;72 pouces to a 4th proportional, which will be Pouces./36.714<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">8 &equals; 39.1619 inches, the length of the pendulum for latitude 48&deg; 50&prime;.
