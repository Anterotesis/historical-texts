<P>THIS Book of <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tes</HI> was wrote by <HI>Soloman</HI> in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Years (as is &s;uppo&s;ed by mo&s;t Interpreters) as a Recantation, and Penitential, after he had &s;pent the youthful part of his days in the fulle&s;t enjoyments of the things of this life.

And then he proceeds, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> la&s;t <HI>Chapters</HI> to let us know wherein our true and onely Felicity really does con&s;i&s;t, and that he tells us is in this, that we <HI>fear God, and keep his Commandments,</HI> as that which will yield us &s;olid Comfort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Satisfaction in this life, be&s;ides the joyful expectations it will give us in the next.</P>
<P>AND having done this he does then very affectionately addre&s;s him|&s;elf to young Per&s;ons in the words of my Text, that taking it upon his word and experience, the truth of what he had before &s;aid, as to the mere <HI>vanity</HI> of all Earthly Enjoyments, and the true &s;atisfaction there is in the <HI>fear of God;</HI> they would not make it their whole bu&s;ine&s;s to pur&s;ue the empty Enjoyments of this World, which would certainly di&s;appoint them; but betake them&s;elves to an early Piety, &s;o acceptable and well plea&s;ing to their Maker, before Sickne&s;s and Old Age force them, whe|ther they will, or no, to make an unwilling, and a loathed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acrifice of them&s;elves to him. <HI>Remember now</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>SO that the&s;e you &s;ee, are the kind Admonitions of a Charitable Per|&s;on (who him&s;elf had once been &s;adly &s;hipwrack'd in a gulf of &s;en&s;uality &amp; filthyne&s;s, they are his kind warnings to you that are younger Per&s;ons, to avoid the li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Errors; But to betake your &s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly to the nece&s;|&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion betimes, and to make it your fir&s;t, and earlie&s;t choice; to engage your &s;elves in Gods &s;ervice in your more <HI>youthful, healthier,</HI> and <HI>active days;</HI> and not to defer this weighty Affair, till you are &s;ick, or are broken by the infirmities of Old Age, when it is hardly to be expected that He &s;hould at all accept of &s;o heartle&s;s, and languid a Service, as we can then pay him.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">HERE is nothing which is more incumbent upon the Mini&s;ters of Gods Church at all times, than to form the principles, and manners of youth, as may appear from that Emphatical Charge of our Saviours to St. <HI>Peter John</HI> 22.15. and in him to all other the Apo&s;tles, and Mini&s;ters in his Church. <HI>Feed my lambs.</HI> But now at this time e&s;pecially, we of the Clergy in this Province, have more than an ordinary Call to apply our &s;elves particularly to this Duty.</P>
<P>FOR why? It is now that the Patriots of this Country are giving that E&s;tabli&s;hment by Law to Religion among&s;t them; and with that Unanimity, and general Con&s;ent, which &s;hews that it is no indifferent thing to them, And this they do &s;o nobly expre&s;s, In &s;uch words, as indeed de&s;erve to be written (both for the perpetual Honour of this Pro|vince, and for a Memorandum to us of the Clergy, to what purpo&s;es we are e&s;tabli&s;h'd) in <HI>Letters of Gold,</HI> on <HI>Pillars of Marble.</HI></P>
<P>IT is for this End they declare they do this glorious Work, that their CHILDREN AND POSTERITY BEING PRESERVED IN THE UNITY OF THE CHURCH, FROM FACTION AND SCHISM, IN HONESTY AND CHARITY, MAY BECOME GOOD AND SOBER MEN, LOVING VIRTUE, FLYING VICE, THE RATI|ONAL CONS<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">QUENCE OF TRUE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE.

<P>Well! I can venture here to promi&s;e for all tho&s;e my Brethren, over whom I pre&s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that with the&s;e terms they will heartily comply, and to an&s;wer tho&s;e expectations every one of them &s;hall make it his principal Care. And as the Call we have to this Duty is <HI>extraordinary,</HI> &s;o the me|thods, which &s;hall be taken, will be more than <HI>common</HI>; &s;o that not one|ly the Children &s;hall be in&s;tructed in the Elements of Chri&s;tianity, by learning their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by heart; Together with &s;ome &s;hort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of it; But the youth that are come up to years of Di&s;cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

therefore more capable to receive a more through knowledge in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Doctrines of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and of their Covenant wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall be taken care of by &s;uch a method of in&s;truction in the way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>liar Conference,</HI> as will,, I am per&s;waded, when try'd by them, be as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> plea&s;ing, as it will be found profitable to all of them.</P>
<P>BUT then the execution of this grand part of the Mini&s;ters Duty will be impo&s;&s;ible for them without the concurrence of tho&s;e committed to their charge, re&s;pectively. The per&s;ons to be thus Catechi&s;'d and in|&s;tructed are of two &s;orts, <HI>Children,</HI> and <HI>grown Youth.</HI> The former are uncapable of knowing the benefit of &s;uch in&s;tructions, &s;o as to be indu|ced of them&s;elves to de&s;ire, or &s;eek the means thereof; and tho&s;e there|fore mu&s;t be brought, oblig'd, and if occa&s;ion &s;hall be, mu&s;t be ordered and made to come to be Catechi&s;ed, by their re&s;pective Parents, and Ma&s;ters, who&s;e duty it is, with <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> to take care, <HI>that they, and their hou&s;e &s;erve the Lord.</HI> And I have great rea&s;on to hope that this charge will be duly performed by Parents and Ma&s;ters throughout the Province, being the Chief per&s;ons in the &s;everal parts thereof, and who&s;e example therefore will be &s;ufficient to influence others, have &s;o &s;olemnly declar'd to the World, that the end wherefore they E&s;tabli&s;h Religion is, that their <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Po&s;terity</HI> may be train'd up in it.</P>
<P>THE great work will be to per&s;wade <HI>Youth of riper years</HI> to yeild up them&s;elves to the Tutelage, and In&s;truction of their re&s;pective Pa&s;tors, Since that Youth too commonly are vain, head&s;trong, and aver&s;e to &s;erious Admonitions. But be&s;ides that the methods which will be taken with them, &s;hall be &s;o free and familiar, as I dare &s;ay, would not be di&s;a|greeable to &s;uch as are mo&s;t advanc'd in years; In order to prepare them to be more complyant with the per&s;wa&s;ions therewith of their re&s;pective Pa&s;tors, I &s;hall make it my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to engage them e&s;pecially to an early entertainment, and choice of Religion. In the management of which duty of theirs, I will endeavour by Gods A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to do the&s;e two things.</P>

to Remember their Creator in the days of their youth; and on the other hand, how exceeding dangerous to defer it to the evil days, the days of &s;ick|ne&s;s, or of old age; tho&s;e days we our &s;elves have no plea&s;ure in.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AND fir&s;t, let us con&s;ider the duty, what it is to Remember our Crea|tor.</HI></P>
<P>AND to <HI>Remember our Creator</HI> is of the number of tho&s;e Scripture ex|pre&s;&s;ions, that do imply in the meaning of them, the whole Sum, and Sub&s;tance of Religion. Thus to <HI>know God,</HI> to <HI>believe in him,</HI> to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear him,</HI> and <HI>to love him,</HI> do all of 'em import no le&s;s in Scripture many times, than to be entirely Religious; becau&s;e that Knowledge, Faith, Fear, and Love are powerful, and active principles within us, influencing tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed therewith, to be in the whole frame of their mind, and will, entirely Religious. And of the &s;ame nature is this expre&s;&s;ion al&s;o <HI>Rememember your Creator.</HI> For,</P>
<P N="1">1. To <HI>Remember our Creator</HI> does nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e a due knowledge of him, for that it is impo&s;&s;ible to <HI>remember,</HI> or call to mind what we ne|ver had any knowledge of. Now Almighty God may be known by his Creatures both in his Nature and Attributes; and in his works of Crea|tion, Providence, and of Grace; and in tho&s;e excellent and gracious Laws which he has given to us to govern our Lives and Conver&s;ations in this World. And in all the&s;e re&s;pects it ought to be the chief &s;tudy of Mankind (whom above all inferiour Creatures he has made capable of &s;uch knowledge) thus to know him; e&s;pecially it concerns Youth to furni&s;h them&s;elves with &s;uch knowledge of their Creator betimes, as it is ordered them, and as they are advi&s;ed here in my Text. <HI>Remember thy Creator, in the days of thy youth,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND now if we would know him as to his Nature and Attributes, what other is he, than the &s;upreme Governour of the World, who&s;e knowledge reaches to all things pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come; which pier|ces into the mo&s;t &s;ecret Councels and Contrivances of our Hearts; and takes our thoughts in their fir&s;t motions, even before we our &s;elves have found them, who&s;e Wi&s;dom has allways in its Eye the be&s;t Ends, and does often bring about his wi&s;e Purpo&s;es by means mo&s;t improbable to our &s;eemings! who&s;e Goodne&s;s permits him not to &s;lave his Creatures

They think that God will violently interpo&s;e, and will &s;ave them whether they will or no. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow many Millions are mi&s;taken, and never open their Eyes to &s;ee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mi&s;take&punc; till awakened by the Flames of Hell?

that takes away their Under&s;tandings, or an Apoplexy that de|prives them in a Minute of their Sen&s;e? How many in a Duel, and how many in a fit of Drunkene&s;s? No! it is not to be expected that when the various Talents of Gods Grace have been long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that he &s;hould &s;till continue them to us. He promi&s;es in|deed to tho&s;e that have, or make u&s;e of the Talents they have, that more &s;hall be given; But he does a&s;&s;uredly threaten, that from tho&s;e who have not, &s;hall be taken away, even that which they have. And &s;o God knows it often happens, that the Divine Patience is at length &s;o worn out, that his Grace is wholly with|drawn from &s;ome Men; and they are given up to a Reprobate Sen&s;e as irrecoverably lo&s;t, and have in Effect the dreadful Sen|tence upon them, even before they go out of this World.</P>
<P>BUT do we not &s;ometimes &s;ee Men Recover at la&s;t, by a Mira|cle of Grace? It is true, but as Miracles are very rare, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> never wrought but upon extraordinary Occa&s;ions, &s;o are the&s;e Mens Conver&s;ion. It was to &s;erve &s;ome Grand Purpo&s;es in the wi&s;e Government of the World, and mu&s;t not ordinarily be de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pended upon. And pray by what extraordinary Methods of Grace is it we do &s;ometimes &s;ee old, <HI>inveterate</HI> Sinners Recovered to a Sight and Sen&s;e of their Sins? Why by &s;ome terrible Blow to them in their Per&s;ons, or Families; by &s;ome di&s;mal Calamities, and Lo&s;&s;es in their E&s;tates, or perhaps by &s;ome amazing Stroaks of Con&s;cience. And is this advi&s;eable to put thy &s;elf into &s;uch a State, that the way to bring thee out of it, is to make thee a mo&s;t mi&s;erable Creature? Can this be a Hopes to be depended upon, by one that values not a Cour&s;e of Sin, but for the Plea&s;ures of it? How contradictious are the Rea&s;onings of &s;uch Men, who indulge them&s;elves in a Cour&s;e of Sin in their youthful Days, in hopes hereafter to be brought to a better Sen&s;e of it. The Sen&s;e they mu&s;t hope to be brought to, will be but little differing from the Pangs of the Damn'd; the better way therefore will be by a timely Religion which has no Remor&s;es following it, to prevent the ne|ce&s;&s;ity

<P>AND now my dearly beloved Youth, let me be&s;eech you in the Bowels of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, and lay to Heart what I have now told you. Let me intreat you as you would not ca&s;t the vile&s;t, the mo&s;t provoking Contempt in the World up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> your Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r, by preferring your fooli&s;h Lu&s;ts before him; as you would not render it extreamly difficult hereafter to Remember him; as you would not render it impo&s;&s;ible for you without &s;uch Me|thods of Grace, as you of all Men would have lea&s;t Rea&s;on to ex|pect, as you would have little Rea&s;on to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ire; on the other hand&punc; as you would do the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, and acceptable thing to God; as you would acquai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t your &s;elves with the Sweets of an early Piety; as you would ever Re&s;i&s;t the unutterable Con&s;olati|ons of a timely Religion: Nay, and let me add; as you would render your &s;elves the Joy of your Parents, the Darling of your Country, the Hopes, the Eager Expectations of the next Age; let me reque&s;t you, let me conjure you, to <HI>Remember your Creator in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of your youth.</HI></P>
<P>TO Remember him! How I pray you? Why as I told you be|fore; &s;tudy to know him in his Nature and Attributes, in his works of Creation, Providence, and of Grace, and in tho&s;e Excellent and Glorious Laws he has given us. And then forget not, neglect not to pre&s;ent him often to your Thoughts, as thus known. <HI>Remember him</HI> as a di&s;cerner of the Thoughts and Intents of your Hearts, and let this cha&s;e away thence all impure, and uncha&s;t Thoughts, all unrighteous, and revengeful Thoughts, all impious and ungodly Thoughts, that they have not the lea&s;t entertainment there. Re|member him as now &s;itting in Heaven, and Regi&s;tering up in a Book all your Words; and let this re&s;train the Exorbitances of an evil Tongue; &s;o that henceforth you may &s;uffer no Oaths, nor Cur&s;es; no Lies nor Slanders: no cen&s;uring, nor evil &s;peaking, no Calumnies nor Detractions to be utter'd thence. Remember him next as a Holy and Righteous Judge that Eternally hates Sin,

<P>AND what good now is it that impedes this our Remembrance of our Creator?

<P>Vain it is, for that it neither does&punc; nor can perform what we ex|pect from it: Vain, for that it promi&s;eth &s;atisfaction, but leaves us nothing but di&s;apointment; Vain, for that a &s;ingle Cro&s;s will im|bitter all its Comforts; Vain, for that the longer we enjoy my Worldly Goods the more flat and in&s;ipid do they gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w upon us; and Vain, in that its highe&s;t Enjoyments are incon&s;tant and fickle.

<P>BUT this is not half; It will help you to look Death in the Face boldly; It will help you to welcome the &s;talking Mon&s;ter; It will fill your Hearts with Joys unutterable; Joys that will almo&s;t bur&s;t your Earthen Ve&s;&s;els; Joys that are pure and Spiritual, Joys that are the Antepa&s;ts of Heaven; <HI>Joys &s;uch as Eye has not &s;een, nor Ear heard, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath ever entered our Hearts to conceive.</HI></P>
