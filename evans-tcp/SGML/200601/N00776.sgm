<P>'TIS well known, to all that know the ancient <HI>Laws</HI> of the <HI>only People,</HI> which the God of <HI>Heaven</HI> then had on <HI>Earth,</HI> That the Lord by His <HI>Laws</HI> required His People, to offer their <HI>Fir&s;t Fruits</HI> unto Him. Yea, The <HI>Fir&s;t Sons</HI> of men that ever were <HI>Born</HI> into the World, actually and practically acknowledged their Obligations to offer their <HI>Fir&s;t Fruits</HI> unto the Lord. And the <HI>Pa|gans</HI> them&s;elves found the <HI>Tradition,</HI> of paying their <HI>Fir&s;t Fruits</HI> unto the Lord, &s;o agreeable unto the <HI>Light of Na|ture</HI> in them, that even among the <HI>Pagans</HI> al&s;o, it was a Note of the Highe&s;t <HI>Profanity,</HI> for any to Refu&s;e the pay|ment thereof.

<P>That as All Men mu&s;t Dy, &s;o Young men may Dy.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons may be liable to the Stroke of <HI>Death,</HI> even in the Time of <HI>Youth.</HI> 'Tis ob&s;erved by the Learned <HI>Amyraut,</HI>
<Q>That the Saints of old, thought that God &s;ent them into the World for two ends; the one, to advance His <HI>Glory</HI> as much as they were able; the other, to Enjoy therein the Te&s;timonies of His <HI>Favour,</HI> in Tem|poral Ble&s;&s;ings for a cour&s;e of years, which is the <HI>Ordinary Term of Life: Death</HI> before the <HI>Full Age</HI> of a man, they therefore deprecated, as among the Te&s;timonies of the Divine <HI>An|ger</HI>; as if a <HI>Young Plant</HI> &s;hould complain to the Gardiner,, for cutting it off at the Root, when it is ju&s;t beginning to <HI>Bud.</HI></Q>

Death</HI> in no <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> at all. <HI>All Ages</HI> from a &s;ad Experience have given us a full Demon&s;tration of it; That per&s;ons are Seized by Death at <HI>all Ages.

One that, ha's an <HI>Husband</HI> or a <HI>Father</HI> in the Morning, does not <HI>know</HI> but this Day may make them, a <HI>Widow</HI> and an <HI>Or|phan.</HI> A <HI>Job</HI> has his <HI>Children</HI> about him, in the Morning, and he did not <HI>know,</HI> that before Night his <HI>Children</HI> &s;hould be <HI>his</HI> no more.
