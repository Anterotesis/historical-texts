<HEAD>AN ORATION DELIVERED ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, 1797.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now convened, to commemorate the day on which America dared to announce her Inde|pendence; a day ever to be had in remembrance by freemen, and which, with honest pride, we may consider as the harbinger of freedom to the world.</P>
<P>We are assembled, my fellow citizens, not for boasting, but for reflection; not pompously to relate the atchievements of our Senators in the cabinet, and of our Heroes in the field; but from a view of the causes of the revolution, of its effects and of our present political situation, to familiarize our minds to the duties we still owe our country.</P>
<P>No sooner had our oppressed and fugitive parents, the puritans of England, found an asylum in the new world, where they hoped to enjoy uncontroul|ed, their civil and religious rights, than under a pre|tence of a right of the crown, and the more <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

pretence of regard and protection, proud and am|bitious Britain began to interfere in their political concerns, and to claim a sovereignty over them&mdash;the claim was at first small, our ancestors enjoyed privileges denied them in their native country, they cultivated their fields unmolested, the soil was im|proved, it amply rewarded their labours&mdash;the arbi|trary spirit of the crown began however gradually to increase; court favorites and ministerial dependents were constantly making demands of them for services of little value, and performed without their request&mdash;our fathers oppose every arbitrary act, and for many years previous to the revolution, discover an uniform disposition to govern themselves&mdash;the unhappy contentions between the Governors and Legislatures, between the proprietors and those who held their land by an Indian purchase, between the Magistrates and the People, and the partialities shewn towards the members of the established Church, as they proved a material defect in our co|lonial government, tended to pave the way for a new and a better system&mdash;these evils, in addition to the grievances which followed, would naturally ex|cite a wish for independence, and in the exercise of that wish, reason and justice would naturally dic|tate, that Americans had a right to their independ|ence, free from all discontent.</P>
<P>The famous stamp act passed in 1764, excited uni|versal indignation in America; this act forbade the admission in the courts of justice, of any instrument not written on paper stamped and sold for the benefit of the British Treasury&mdash;Americans agree to re|nounce the consumption of all articles furnished by Britain till this illegal and oppressive bill be with|drawn&mdash;the stamp act is revoked, but some time af|ter,

the parliament ordain, that the revenue which could not be obtained by means of stamps, shall be raised by taxes on the glass, the lead, the pasteboard and the paper hangings, carried from England to America&mdash;this act proves equally inefficacious with the former&mdash;Americans not only refuse compliance, but demand a formal renunciation&mdash;a renunciation is obtained, the tax on tea only excepted. After|wards, the ministry, deceived by their delegates, conceive Americans humbled into submission, and order the collection of the duty on tea&mdash;an increased indignation seizes the colonies; masters of vessels a|gree not to suffer this production to make any part of their cargo, and merchants to whom it is con|signed, refuse to receive it. The use of tea is solemn|ly renounced in many provinces&mdash;in others, they burn what they have remaining&mdash;the inhabitants of Boston, famed for its republican spirit, destroy three cargoes of tea which had arrived from Europe. This as might have been expected, drew upon them the vengeance of a selfish and haughty ministry&mdash;a bill is passed for blocking up the harbor of Boston; this act involving the citizens of Boston in one com|mon calamity and distress, excited the compassion of their sympathising brethren, from New-Hampshire to Georgia. It was called inhuman, cruel, bloody. The native dignity of man here broke forth with lustre in the American character&mdash;Americans shew they have not the servile spirit tamely to crouch and submit to insult and degradation; that they have not that unmanly softness which fears to bar|ter its repose for honorable danger. When threat|ened with all the horrors of war, a powerful and a disciplined army in battle array before them, to in|force a cruel and oppressive edict, mark, my fellow citizens, with what prudence and courage they pro|ceed;

assemblies are called for the respective states, a congress of delegates from all the states is conven|ed. They consult, they deliberate, not like the min|ions of despotism, not like slaves awed by fear, but like virtuous men, acquainted with the principles of rational liberty&mdash;their discussions were cool and can|did, their determinations just and upright; their conduct such as became men deciding the fate of millions; they address their fellow citizens by ap|peals to their reason and understanding&mdash;the inha|bitants of Great-Britain, of Ireland, of Canada and of Jamaica, are respectively addressed by arguments the most forcible and persuasive, by appeals to their real interests in the cause of liberty. The King is twice petitioned in modest, but in bold and manly language, calculated to make an impression on any heart not of adamant. The venerable Franklin, having solicited in vain, the addresses to the King proving ineffectual, and the colonies receiving fresh insults and injuries the most outrageous violence; they resolve, that Great-Britain has forfeited every claim to her colonies, they determine to be free and independent, [as has just now been read to us,] they resolve to conquer or die in the attempt.</P>
<P>It was not the quantity of the tax, it was not the mode of appropriation, but it was the right to tax us, without our consent, which was called in ques|tion; it had been a principle of the British consti|tution, that representation and taxation should go together; this principle was well understood in America, the consequences which would result from a violation of it, were also well foreseen; if it were allowed in one instance, it might in another, and as in general there would be no bounds to the rapaci|ty of the imposing power, so there would be no li|mits

to the rule, beyond its exigences and caprice. It was hard indeed, that the burden should be said by those who could not feel its weight. Accustom|ed to view dangers future as well as present, they see the lurking designs of Great-Britain to reduce them to a state of degradation, little preferable to slavery. The principle of independence, instanta|neous as lightning, pervades all classes of citizens, all hearts are united in the cause of repelling force by force, and of freeing their country from the power of tyranny, and from the threatened yoke of bon|dage.</P>
<P>Through innumerable difficulties, through seas of trouble, through oceans of blood, exposed to frequent losses from British rapine, and from a de|preciation of our continental paper currency, have our fathers gloriously struggled and gained us free|dom and independence.</P>

<P>Our Independence was atchieved, but to secure our independence, government was necessary, an efficient government which should unite these states by ties much stronger than the feeble ties of the confederation. Fear arising from danger, which stared us in the face, during the revolution, natural|ly tended to promote a temporary union&mdash;in the midst of a common calamity, local interests and pre|judices, were made to yield to the means of its re|moval, to general and public interests of much greater moment. But war being removed and our fears subsided, it was necessary that union should be established on a more permanent basis. A very ma|terial
<PB N="9" REF="032000_0008_0FF09D6D2BB73920">
evil, incident to the confederation, resulted from the dependence of the revenues on the inter|mediate agency of its members; a power of provi|ding for the pecuniary wants of the union, had been intended, but that power was frustrated; there be|ing no power of coercion, individual states treated with neglect, the most necessary measures and re|quisitions of Congress; the necessity of a general power of taxation in the federal government, was acknowledged as essential to the existence of the union&mdash;the delinquencies of some of the states, in consequence of which, treaties and laws, on which depended our honor, credit and safety, proved the necessity of vesting this power in a federal head.&mdash;The inducements to union appeared more strong, on considering the policy of foreign nations to divide and weaken us; disunited we were unable to repel foreign attacks, we were liable to be broken to pie|ces by the inroads of foreign influence; it was con|sidered that the different states, subject to various foreign attachments and animosities, would be go|verned by the caprice of the respective foreign na|tions, and exposed to constant broils; but all agree|ing to repose sufficient authority in a federal head, discord among the members would frown aghast, foreigners would be deterred from exercising the arts of corruption, and the power of corruption would be too feeble to withstand the vigilance and energy of a government thus powerful; in short it was considered as necessary for our safety and de|fence against foreign attacks and internal convul|sions for our strength, for our national dignity and character, for the favourable regulation of com|merce with other nations, for the superintendence of our intercouse with them, political and commer|cial; that there should be a consolidation of the
<PB N="10" REF="032000_0009_0FF09D6AD2496198">
states, that they should form a cordial union under an efficient national government. The union was effected in a manner which does honor to our na|tion. The federal constitution, with some opposi|tion, was adopted by all the states. Allow me to say, it is the fairest fabrick of political perfection ever erected by human skill. The majesty of the peo|ple, the fountain from which all authority flows&mdash;the election of the different officers, the pivot on which the wheel turns, provided with sufficient checks and balances, wisely subjected to amend|ments, calculated, in short, to promote and to pre|serve the safety and happiness of the people, it is a go|vernment entitled to our warmest attachment and our most decided support. You remember, my fel|low citizens, with how much deliberation this go|vernment was devised, with how much unanimity it was established. Let the citizens of America then ever cherish it as the gift of heaven.</P>
<P>Being thus united and happy under our federal union; our commerce, our agriculture and manufac|tures flourishing with rapid progress; cities and vil|lages rising every where to view; the wilderness blossoming as the rose; religion, learning and the arts, which civilize and polish society, diffusing their benign influences far and wide; plenty with her full horn carrying every where joy and gladness; pos|sessing all the blessings of peace and independence, fortified by a firm and an indissoluble union; our population rapidly extending, our country advanc|ing space to strength, wealth and fame; indulgent providence smiling upon us; while nothing was to be heard in Europe but the tumult of destructive war, and the horrid din of arms; we wanted no|thing
<PB N="11" REF="032000_0010_0FF09D6F6FCCCD18">
to complete the pleasing scene, but gratitude and praise to the beneficent author of our felicity. But in the midst of this plentiful effusion of blessings, when the cup of our happiness seemed full, our peace and tranquillity, were endangered from fo|reign wiles and artifices to invoice us in European broils. A foreign incendiary appeared among us, breathing discord, contention and war&mdash;commissions were granted by him for fitting out privateers in our ports, and for enlisting men in South Carolina to assist the French; the whole force of our fede|ral government now became necessary to ward off the danger and to preserve our peace and neutrali|ty; the President issues a proclamation of neutrali|ty prohibiting these proceedings; this proclamation is opposed, and our beloved Washington is decried as the enemy of liberty, as the enemy of the French, and as making war upon the French nation; the seeds of sedition are sown throughout the United States. In the midst of these difficulties, while from the warmth and violence of some of our deluded breth|ren, government is scarcely able to avoid taking an active part in the wars of Europe, and to preserve our internal peace and tranquility, orders are issued from the British to seize our vessels; England is apprehensive that Americans will side with France, and France is displeased because we are determined to remain neutral&mdash;we were in a very serious di|lemma&mdash;we now felt the want of a navy to pro|tect our commerce, to prevent insults and depreda|tions and to cause our neutrality to be respected.&mdash;Our commerce received repeated insults from both nations&mdash;an embargo only tended to increase the general calamity&mdash;it was now debated, shall we se|questrate the British debts? Shall we cease to im|port' Or shall we negociate? The first was con|ceived
<PB N="12" REF="032000_0011_0FF09D808DCEBE88">
derogatory to our national faith and charac|ter and as leading to certain war. The second as involving multitudes in distress, and as destroying the revenue. The third, as an expedient, which possibly might terminate favorably to the peace and honor of our nation, and which, if unsuccessful, would justify an appeal to the dernier resort and promote an union of sentiment among ourselves&mdash;The voice of every good man was in favor of this measure; the hydra of antifederalism and of fac|tion alone raised its forky head against it; those on|ly who had labored to inveigle us in the war, oppo|sed this pacific system. Our envoy, the man whose life had been devoted to the independence, the union and the interests of his country, is calumnia|ted as a man under the influence of British gold, as one who would sell his country&mdash;the treaty was condemned before it was seen, it was said to con|tain a thousand errors with which it had not the most remote relation; the truth was, the friends of opposition were sensible that by any treaty what|ever, their schemes would be defeated. The differ|ences between England and America were happily settled on principles of mutual concession and reci|procity; an honorable treaty of friendship and com|merce is made and ratified beween the two nations, much more favorable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Mr. Kitchell's reasons in favor of carrying the treaty into effect, in his letter dated April</HI> 23, 1796, <HI>to Silas Condict, <ABBR>Esq.</ABBR> by which it will appear that he did not vote for the appropriations, merely be|cause the President and Senate ratified it.</HI></NOTE> to us, than our best friends in England thought we had any reason to expect;

<P>During these difficulties, others more disagreea|ble arise. A violent insurrection breaks out in the Western countles of Pennsylvania, occasioned by combinations of men, who had been encouraged by the enemies of America; ignorant and discontented men, in the western parts of Pennsylvania, and for the honor of our revolution be it said, not Ameri|cans, but mostly emigrants from Europe, who were educated in habits of calumny at home, vent their spleen and their venom against the mildest govern|ment on earth. They trample the laws under their feet, and attempt to break in pieces the ark of our political safety. The authority and energy of our federal government were called forth on the occasion&mdash;the lawless and disobedient are taught o|bedience to the laws&mdash;thus, through the interfer|ence of our beloved WASHINGTON, and to use an idea of the French minister, through the ingenui|ty of <ABBR>Col.</ABBR> Hamilton, the meditated explosion of our government received a timely check. The public aspect of American politics is more favorable, the Indians have laid down the hatchet, and our coun|try experiences the calm joys of peace and domestic

When peace was proclaimed and his country, with one voice, acknowledged that he had done his duty&mdash;view him humbly resigning the insignia of office, and like Triptolemus and Cincinnatus of old, seeking the calm pleasures of a farmer's life. When called by the unanimous suffrages of his fel|low citizens, to fill the Presidental chair, under the federal government, at a time when crowns and sceptres were to him as "sounding brass and as a tinkling eymbal," view him again obedient to the voice of his country, and skilfully and safely conduct|ing the helm of state, amidst the rocks of foreign influence and of internal faction&mdash;when overcome with the encreasing weight of years, view him bid|ding adieu to public honors, again soliciting the re|tirement of private life, addressing his fellow citi|zens, in the language of a departing friend, leaving a valuable legacy to the lovers of freedom, of union and of independence to the latest generations&mdash;fac|tion!

<P><HI>Fellow Citizens of America,</HI></P>
<P>You have a free and a happy government; guard it from abuse; see that the legislative, the execu|tive and the judicial departments, encroach not on each other; the duration, the existence of your go|vernment, depends upon preserving the proper balances pure and distinct&mdash;remember that the ten|dency of federal governments, is rather to anarchy among the members, than to tyranny in the head.

It was not from the encroachments of the Amphyc|tionic Council, but from the jealousies and dissenti|ons of the various members, Athens, Sparta and Thebes, that Philip made himself master of the con|federacy, and that Greece was obliged to wear the chains of Macedon. It was not from the powers of the Achean league, but from its weakness, and the arts of division, practised among the members, that it became a prey to the artifices and the arms of Rome. The Romans proclaimed universal li|berty throughout Greece, but it was to the aston|ishment of those who confided in their sincerity.</P>
<P>My fellow citizens, the despotic Philip is at the door. Beware of the inroads of foreign influence, of the men who carry liberty in their faces, but ty|ranny in their hearts; outwardly as harmless sheep, inwardly as ravenous wolves, they are the more dangerous from their hypocrisy. Remember that faction is the rock on which republics have always split&mdash;ever keep in mind the admonition of our be|loved Washington, that all foreign attachments and animosities should be equally disclaimed&mdash;that self|interest is the ruling principle of nations, and that it is in vain to expect national favors. Let not an en|thusiastical zeal in the cause of any foreign nation, lead us to sacrifice the right of private judgment, the independence of our country and the dignity of our own free government.

<HI>Fellow Citizens,</HI></P>
<P>The principles of antifederalism are false and dangerous; the original and secret abettors of these principles have for eight years been using every ar|tifice and stratagem, which human invention could devise, for the destruction of our federal govern|ment. The enemies of administration are enemies of government, of that government, which from the beginning many of them opposed, and which others have since opposed, from motives of jealous envy and disappointed ambition. Why else have they invariably opposed every attempt to put our|selves in a state of defence either when threatened by Britain or by France? Why else have they op|posed the best system for sinking our public debt?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>It is a fact that <ABBR>Col.</ABBR> Hamilton's system for dis|charging the public debt, was much more just and likes to attain the object, than any other proposed.</HI></NOTE> Cast your eyes to the Eastern States, famed for their knowledge, their virtue and their federalism&mdash;to the Southern States, famed for the opposite char|acter acquaint yourselves with the manners, with the real character of the respective divisions&mdash;Will any man in his sober senses, conclude, that in New|England, they are friends to tyranny and an oppres|sive government; while in Virginia and the South|ern States, the principles of liberty and republican|ism alone prevail?

When, my fellow citizens, you espouse the cause of antifed|eralism, you espouse the cause of men who are go|verned by opposition, and who have no steady prin|ciples; you launch into an ocean of uncertainty, in|to a dangerous labyrinth where every thing is con|fusion. Antifederalists, like deists, find fault with the government, without proposing a better system, and like deists they have a similar diversity of senti|ment. Blind faction leads the van, followed by en|vy, foul ambition and her baneful retinue; but the cause of federalism is the cause of reason, every thing is calm, steady and uniform&mdash;security is given to life, liberty and property&mdash;encouragement is given to the arts of industry, the arts of peace and civilization; virtue and honest merit afford the path to preferment. How striking the contrast! The one breathes disunion and war&mdash;the other breathe; the mild spirit of union and peace.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>This last section was omitted in the pronunciati|on, the variety of the airs of music having protracted the time beyond all expectation.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>To preserve our union, we should not only be republicans, but we should be federal republicans; it becomes Americans who were united in times of the greatest danger, and who by their union, have established their common liberty and independence, to prove to the world, that their reason is equal to their courage, that they have wisdom to discover every attempt to break their union, to discover se|cret

and political dangers, and to unite under the <HI>federal standard</HI> in their destruction.</P>
<P>On a subject of such importance, the duties which our country requires from the fair part of my audi|tory, ought not to be forgotten. On the industry and patriotism of the fair daughters of Columbia, much depends for the support of our government, for the continuance of our political union and hap|piness. Ye bright ornaments of American inde|pendence, who nobly assisted in the revolution, bravely partook of the dangers, and whose pre|sence now adds to the joys of our common anniver|sary, your country looks up to your virtues.</P>
<P>By impressing sentiments of patriotism and magna|nimity in the minds of your children, in the early stage of their education, they become furnished with wea|pons of defence more powerful than the sword, the bayonet and all the arms of war. Just political prin|ciples, planted in the tender minds of your children will never die, but will grow up with them to man|hood, and acquire an influence co-extensive with the government; in this way, happy in your do|mestic retirement, free from the noise and bustle of the world, you may have the real honor of being the rulers of America.</P>
<P>To the virtuous, the generous, and the magnan|imous Isabella, an ornament to your sex, the admi|ration of ours, and an ornament to human nature, America was in a measure indebted for its discove|ry. That its discovery may prove the happiness and glory of the world, much depends on your conduct and exertions. In despotic governments, women have been considered merely as toys and as
<PB N="21" REF="032000_0020_0FF097E469D37948">
the slaves of passion; in free governments they are justly considered as rational beings; you will make it your pride as you ever have done, to support this character, and bid defiance to the slanders of despo|tism, by cultivating the charms of your minds, as much as the graces of form and the improvements of your persons. Convince proud and unfeeling des|pots, that woman is calculated to move in the sphere of reason and government.</P>
<P>To perpetuate your union, fellow citizens, diffuse among all classes of citizens, principles of knowledge and virtue: had I the character and influence of a Washington, had I a voice which could be heard from New-Hampshire to Georgia, my constant ad|monition should be, Americans, make the promotion of knowledge and religion the first, the principal <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of your lives; these constitute the chief bar|riers, the strongest defence of your republic; these will promote your union, by making your jarring interests and your discordant passions to subside. No more will the South be jealous of the North, the husbandman will no more envy the merchant the prosperity of the union will be acknowledged to be the prosperity of its members. From the evils, from the dangers, which have for four years past, convulsed our republic, and which now threaten <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> destruction; I conjure you to rally round your own good sense, and hasten to the standard of union United we stand, divided we fall&mdash;"Why quit our own to stand on foreign ground?" Where can we stand so safe as on the firm ground, and under the banners of our federal government?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="032000_0021_0FF09D627792A388">
Let us all, my fellow citizens, remember the du|ties our country requires of us as citizens and as christians; let union be our polar star to direct us in our political course; let our fathers be the pat|rons of religion, and our mothers the nurses of vir|tue; let that principle of benevolence which regards the happiness of future ages, dictate the con|duct of all, and America shall survive the ruin of her enemies, and remain and flourish, until GOD shall call her sons to happier abodes, where all is UNION, HARMONY and LOVE.</P>
