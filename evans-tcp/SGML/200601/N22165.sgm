<HEAD>THE PREFACE,</HEAD>
<HEAD>To the First American Edition.</HEAD>
<P>AT <HI>a period, when the</HI> United States of America <HI>are advancing rapidly in the career of improve|ment, and her citizens afford such ample encouragement to all the arts, that meliorate and embellish life, every attempt to add to the general stock in this way will, doubt|less, meet with that share of attention, which it deserves. It is on this presumption only that the following pages are offered to the public inspection;&mdash;and the Editors are hap|py in believing that a work, like this, calculated to pro|mote industry and stimulate genius, will be received as an acceptable contribution.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Although the useful and necessary arts and manufactures, which have mostly hitherto employed the industrious citizens of America, have acquired a degree of perfection, which rivals the productions of Europe, those, which are distin|guished by elegance and refinement are but little known, or at best in their infancy. We are still indebted to the work shops of other nations for the greater part of the finer articles we consume. But as a taste of this kind is daily spreading among us, and as wealth which affords the means of gratification, is likewise increasing, it will be sound policy, as well as good economy to produce all that we can among ourselves, and no longer to remain tributary to foreign markets. This will be the surest means of esta|blishing our independance on the for nest basis.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="029242_0003_0FDFFC8235848020">
<HI>Whilst the inhabitants of Europe are distracted by the din of arms, and their principal employment is to contrive the most expeditious means of destroying one another, let the happy citizens of these infant States turn their atten|tion to the useful and elegant arts of peace;&mdash;let them avail themselves of the discoveries of these ancient nations in the happier years that are past; until we no longer stand in need of their supplies, or remain exposed to the fluctu|ations of their fortune.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The work now offered to the public is well calculated to promote this beneficial purpose, being a large and various collection of important secrets in the finer arts and trades; secrets which bave resulted from repeated experiments made by the first artists in England, France, Italy and Germany, and which open an extensive field for the exer|cise of American ingenuity and improvement.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Art of engraving, <HI>to which we are indebted for so many elegant copies of the finest works of genius, and which is in it's infant state here, will derive great advan|tage by a due observation of the directions and receipts con|tained in this volume.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The various combinations and composition of metals; the art of</HI> varnishing; of making maitichs and cements; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uriositi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s in</HI> glass and precious stones; <HI>the art of</HI> mix|ing colours <HI>for painting; of</HI> gilding; of dying wood, bones, ivory, &amp;c. <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d the various methods of</HI> casting in moulds, <HI>explained in these sheets, will conduce greatly to facilitate the progress of these ingenious arts in the United States of America.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Besides these principal articles there are many other matters in this collection that are not confined to the use of the artist, but will be equally profitable to every reader, who wishes to be acquainted with a number of curious and useful receipts, applicable to the common occasions of life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To render this work more easy to be understood, and of course to extend its utility, all the receipts are rendered as free as possible of that technical obscurity, which is pecu|liar to the arts, and which makes subjects of this kind dis|gusting to common readers.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>SECRETS relative to the Art of ENGRAVING.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>I. A wax to lay on iron or steel.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE the bulk of a nut of white wax: melt it, and add to it the size of a musquet ball of cruse of Venice. When both are incorporated together, form this composition into small sticks. With them rub your piece of steel, or iron, after having previously warmed it sufficiently to melt the wax, which you will spread well over it with a feather. When the wax is cold, trace whatever you will on it, and pass afterwards, on the lines you shall have drawn, the following water.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>II. A mordant water to engrave on steel.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Take good verjuice in grapes, the strongest you can find; alum in powder, and a little salt dried and pulve|rised. Mix all together till perfectly dissolved: then 
<PB N="2" REF="029242_0020_0FDFFCBFD580C2C0">
pass some of that water on the lines of your drawing, re|peating the same, till it is sufficiently deep engraved. That engraving will appear white, as silver, on a white ground.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or else take verdigrise, strong vinegar, ammoniac and common salts, and copperas, equal parts. Set all together-aboiling, for a quarter of an hour: then strain it through a rag, and run some of that water on your plate. In about half an hour afterwards it will be per|fectly engraved.</P>
<P N="3">3. Callot's varnish, of which the composition shall be found hereafter, in the chapter on varnishes, is an admirable composition to lay on the plate you propose to engrave.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>III. To engrave with aquafortis, so that the work may appear like a basso relievo.</HEAD>
<P>Take equal parts of vermilion and of black lead: two or three grains of mastick in drops. Grind them all together, on marble, with lintseed oil; then put this com|position into a shell. Next to this operation, cut some soft quils, and let your steel or iron be well polished. Try first whether your colour runs sufficiently with your pens: and, if it should not, you must add a little more oil to it; without making it, however, too limpid; but only so as to have your pen mark freely with it, as if you were writing, with ink, on paper. Then rub well your plate of steel with wood ashes, to clean and ungrease it; after which, you wipe it with a clean rag, and draw your design upon it, with your pen, prepared as before, and dipped into your liquor. If you want to draw birds, or other animals, you must only draw the outlines of them with your pen, then fill up the inside of those lines with a hair pencil; that is to say, you will cover all the space, contained between the first outlines drawn with the pen, with the same colour, which you will lay with a brush, to preserve all that part against the mordacity of the aquafortis. When that is done, you see your work dry for a day or two. When driect
<PB N="3" REF="029242_0020_0FDFFCBFD580C2C0">
thus, you take some fire, made with charcoal, into a chafingdish, and bake over it your colour, by degrees, till it becomes quite brown. Take care, notwithstand|ing, not to burn it, for fear you should scale it when you come to scratch, with the point of a needle, those etch|ings, or places, which you want to be engraved, with the following aquafortis.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>IV. Aquafortis for engraving.</HEAD>
<P>Take verdigrise, roch alum, Roman vitriol, and common salt, of each three ounces; which you will pound into a very fine powder. Have a new pipkin, in which you will put a little more than a quart of water, and your drugs, all together. Let them thus infuse a couple of hours; then place them over a charcoal fire: and when the water has a little simmered, take the pot from off the fire, and let it cool so that you may dip your hand in it without scalding. Then have an earthen cup, with which you take of that water, and pour it over the work you mean to engrave; so that it may run well, and freely, over all the places which are to be marked, and then off into a pan placed under to receive it. Continue thus to water your work for three quar|ters of an hour. Then you will pour upon it clear pump water, to wash off the mud which the aquafortis shall have occasioned. You are then to try, with a needle, the depth of the lines of your engraving; and, if not at your liking, you must begin again watering it, as before. The only care you are to have, is, that your liquor should not be too warm: for then it would spoil the work. It is better to use it lukewarm only, and be longer at it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>V. To engrave on brass, or copper, with aquafortis.</HEAD>
<P>You must put in your colour more mastick in drops, and bake it also rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore over the fire, after it is laid on your plate, so that it should turn almost black. And, if it be a flat work, as generally are all those on copper|plates,
<PB N="4" REF="029242_0021_0FDFFCC16D8F77A8">
you must raise around it a border of wax to pre|vent the aquafortis, which you are to pour on it, from running off, and which is to be a separating aquafortis with which you cover the plate to the thickness of a crown piece. After it has been thus left covered with that aquafortis, for a little while, this becomes green; then is the time to throw it away, and to pour, in its place, some pump water, when you will examine whether the lines be sufficiently deep or not. If not, pour again fresh aquafortis on your plate, and thus you will obtain works of basso relievo by contrary; that is to say, raised grounds. You may thus engrave all sorts of works.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>VI. To engrave prints by aquafortis.</HEAD>
<P>Take some ceruse, which you will grind well with clear pump water, and size it with isinglass. Lay this composition with a coarse brush, or pencil, on the plate which you want to engrave. When it is dry, draw on it whatever design you please. Or, if you want to counterproof a copperplate print, blacken all the back of your print; and, placing that blackened part on your plate, prepared as before, go over all the strokes of your print, with a smooth ivory, or wooden point, which will stamp the black of the print, in all those places, on the plate. Then you will go again over all the black strokes, which are laid on your plate with a pen and ink: and, taking afterwards a steel point, very fine and well tempered, you will etch your plate with it, in following all the strokes marked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it, and pour aquafortis, as before directed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>VII. Another.</HEAD>
<P>Take white lead, and grind it well with mastick in drops. Cover your plate with it by means first of a brush, and then smooth it with the soft part of a goose feather. Let this dry for a day or two; then give a second coat of this composition over the first; and spread it with the palm of your hand. When dry, bales
<PB N="5" REF="029242_0021_0FDFFCC16D8F77A8">
it over charcoal, till it comes a little yellow; then draw what you will over it, with a black lead pencil; and proceed afterwards, as before directed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>VIII. The method of engraving with aquafortis.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. You must have a very well polished plate, and per|fectly clean. Set it to warm over a chafingdish, in which there is a charcoal fire. While on it, cover it with a varnish, either dry or liquid, for there are two sorts. Then you blacken that varnish with the flame of a candle, over which you pass and repass the plate on the varnished side.</P>
<P N="2">2. This being done, you have no more to do than to chalk your design on that plate, which is infinitely more easy than to engrave with a graver. For, if you rub the back part of your drawing with some sanguine stone (red chalk) or any thing else, and lay it after|wards on your plate, to trace it with a point, the san|guine, which is on the back of the draught, will easily set off on the varnish. So that you may follow after|wards all the lines of the design, and be infinitely more correct in all the turns, and the expression of the fi|gures. This is the reason why all the painters, who have their own works engraved, take the trouble of drawing also the outlines of their figures, that the spi|rit and beauty of their design may be preserved. In|deed it must be confessed, that we always discover a great deal more art in those pieces which are engraved with aquafortis, than there is found in them that are done by the graver. And, even in many of these, the aquafortis is often employed to sketch lightly the con|tours, or outlines, of the figures, and to have them more correct.</P>
<P N="3">3. True it is, that it is sometimes found necessary to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ittle over, with the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ver, certain parts which are not strong enough, or that the aquafortis has not eaten in sufficiently. For it is not easy, in a great plate, to get all the several parts so proportionably, and a-propos, eaten in, as there should be nothing to find fault with.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="6" REF="029242_0022_0FDFFCCBD9251688">
4. It is not enough for an engraver to work with the point of his needle, or scooper, in all the different places of his work, with the strength and delicacy ne|cessary to make appear, as he wants them to be, the most remote and the nearest parts. It is again requisite that he should take care, when he comes to put the aquafor|tis on his plate, it should not bite equally every where. This is prevented as follows, by a mixture of oil and fallow, which you will drop in it, from a lighted can|dle.</P>
<P N="5">5. To this effect he must have a framed wooden board, overlaid with wax, on which he fixes his plate a little slant way: then pours aquafortis on it, so that it may only pass over it, and run into an earthen pan, placed un|der to receive it. Therefore, he takes care to examine when those parts, which are not to be so deeply eaten in, have received a sufficient quantity of aquafortis: in which case, taking off his plate, he washes it with pump water, by pouring it only over; dries it gently before the fire, then covers the most remote parts, and them which he wants to preserve weakest, with the above mentioned mixture of oil and tallow, that the aquafor|tis should not act, any more on those places. Thus co|vering at several times, and as much as he pleases, such places of his plate as he wants to keep not so strong as others, it results that the figures, which are forwards in the picture, are constantly every time washed with the aquafortis which eats in them, till he sees they are suffi|ciently engraved, and according to the degree of the strength, which he is desirous of giving them.</P>
<P N="6">6. That sort of aquafortis we have mentioned and described in this chapter, at the article of the water for engraving on iron, and which is composed with verdi|grise, vinegar, common and ammoniac salts, and cop|peras, is also made use of to engrave on copper, in pour|ing it on the plates, covered either with hard or soft varnish, and scratched, or etched, agreeably to the de|sign you intend to engrave on them.</P>
<P N="7">7. As for what concerns the refiner's aquafortis, com|monly called white water, it is never used but upon the
<PB N="7" REF="029242_0022_0FDFFCCBD9251688">
soft varnish; and never as the former, which is called green water, by pouring it only over the plate, and let|ting it run off into a pan under it. A border of wax must be made round the plate, on which, this being laid flat upon a table, some of that white water is poured, after having previously tempered it more or less with a proportionable quantity of common water, which is cal|led pickling.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>IX. To engrave on wood.</HEAD>
<P>You begin by preparing a board, according to the size and thickness you want it, and finely polished on the side it is to be engraved. The sort of wood, which is gene|rally chosen for such a purpose, is either pear-tree or box. And, of the two, this last is even still preferable, both on account of its being of a superior hardness, and also less liable to be worm-eaten. On that board you draw first your design, such as you want it to appear in printing. They, who have not the talent of drawing as there are a great number, make use of the very draw|ing you give them, which they paste on their board, by the right side, with a paste made of good flour, water, and a little vinegar. You must take care that all the strokes of the drawing should touch well, and stick on the wood: and, when the paper is very dry, wet it gently and with the tip of your finger rub it off by de|grees, so that the strokes only of the drawing should re|main on your board, as if you had drawn it with ink and a pen. These strokes, or lines, shew you all that you are to spare, or preserve; all the rest you are to cut off and sink down with delicacy by means of a sharp and well-tempered pen-knife, small chisel or gouet, ac|cording to the size and delicacy of the work, for you have no need of any other tool.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>X. To engrave on copper with the graver.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. When the plate, which is to be of red copper, is well polished, you draw your design on it with either
<PB N="8" REF="029242_0023_0FDFFCCDD208D240">
the black lead-stone, or a steel point. When that is done, you have no further need of any thing but very sharp and well-tempered gravers to cut in, and give more or less strength to certain parts, according to the subject, and the figures, you execute.</P>
<P N="2">2. You must also have a certain tool of six inches long, or thereabouts, one of the ends of which, called a scraper, is made in the form of a triangle, sharp on each edge, with which you scrape on the copper when you want it. The other end, called a burnisher, has ve|ry much the shape of a fowl's heart, a little prolonged by the point, round and slender. This serves to po|lish the copper, to mend the faults, and soften the strokes.</P>
<P N="3">3. In order to form a better judgment of your work, you must now and then, as you proceed on, make use of a stump, made with a piece of an old hat rolled up and blackened, with which you rub your plate, on the place you are working, which fills the strokes with black, and makes you see better the effect of your work as you go. You must be provided likewise with a lea|ther cushion, on which you lay your plate while you engrave it.</P>
<P N="4">4. We shall not give any further account of the art of engraving than this short epitome, and we shall not attempt to enter into a more particular detail of the va|rious and curious circumstances attending this noble art. They, whose curiosity on that subject will prompt them to be more particularly acquainted with it, may amply satisfy themselves, by taking the trouble to read the treatise which Abraham Bosse has purposely com|posed on the art of engraving.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>XI. To engrave on steel or iron; such as blades of swords, knives, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Take one part of linden-tree coals; two of vi|triol, and as much of ammoniac salt. Grind all toge|ther with vinegar, so as to obtain a soft paste of it. Then, whatever you want to engrave on steel or iron, being first by sketching it with vermilion diluted with
<PB N="9" REF="029242_0023_0FDFFCCDD208D240">
lintseed oil, which you shall have put a-drying to use it afterwards like a pencil. When your drawing is done, cover it with the above-mentioned paste to the thick|ness of a finger. This composition must be applied warm; and the more warm it is, the sooner the work will be engraved; though you must have care not to burn it.

Pound it all well in a mortar, and put it in a glass vessel sufficiently large, with a proportionable quantity of the strongest distilled vi|negar. Let the whole thus infuse for twelve hours, stirring it often. Draw next what design you like on a coat of wax laid on your iron, or copper, either with a steel point, or fictitious ochre, mixed with lintseed oil. Then pass some of your liquor on the places you shall have etched with a needle, or steel point, in following carefully the strokes of your design, if it be first drawn on wax. For, in the use of this method, you must not fail to begin by covering first your plate with it, as we said elsewhere.

And who ever will proceed, according to the following direction, will not fail to obtain it.</P>

While melting in that crucible, throw in at different times some tutty|powder mixed with equal parts of refined saltpetre.

Put it next in|to a matrass, pour over it regal water, that it swim over by three fingers deep. Put this in digestion for eight hours. Pour off by inclination your regal water impreg|nated with the dye. Put new water on your matter, and set it on digestion again for eight other hours, as the for|mer. Then take your thus tinged waters, which you will mix and put in a retort. Distil most part of it, till you see that what remains in the retort is yellow. This is the true oil of emery, in which you put the bigness of a filbert of camphire.</P>
<P N="2">2. Exsulphurate in a crucible, on a good fire, and dur|ing two hours, what quantity you please of arsenic. Then take two ounces of the aforesaid oil of emery, one of your exsulphurated arsenic, an equal quantity of salt of tartar drawn with distilled vinegar, two of sublimate, and two of silver; which you will have dissolved in an aquafortis made with nitre and vitriol. Put all toge|ther in a matrass so large that the composition should oc|cupy no more than a third part of it, and of which you shall have cut the neck off, to obtain a more easy eva|poration of the compounds from it. Put this matrass is the sand as high as the matter, and give it a moderate fire for two hours, then a strong one for fix, after which you will let the fire go out of itself. When done, you will find your matter in a stone in the matrass. Take it out and pound it into powder. One ounce of this pow|der, projected upon another ounce of salt in fusion, if you keep it a little while in that state, and throw it afterwards into oil of olives, will increase your gold by a third of its primary quantity and rather more: And you may thus increase it again and again by repeating the same operation.</P>

<P N="2">2. Next to this have aloes and karabe, of each two ounces. Dissolve this in a varnished pipkin, along with twelve ounces of lintseed oil, till all is well incorporat|ed. There will fail a ground to the bottom, over which will swim a very fine and transparent liquor. Of this you are to make your second coat of varnish, laying it over the other after it is dry.</P>

<HEAD>I. The general composition of the paste to make spurious precious stones, such as Emeralds, Saphires, Ru|bies,&amp;c.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. PUT three ounces of Poitiers' burnt lead in a suffici|ent quantity of water to have this rise about three fingers above the other. Beat next both together in the bottle, and then let it settle. Draw, by inclination, this water, as soon as the lead is separated from it, in some other vessel. It will serve you to wet the inside of the glazed earthen pot in which you are to put your ingre|dients, and prevent their sticking to it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Dry, now, three ounces of minium, and mix it with the aforesaid burnt-lead, one ounce of calc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> chrystal, and one scruple of copper filings. All these things being previously well pulverised, and mixed, put them in a glazed pipkin, which you shall have harden|ed,
<PB N="77" REF="029242_0057_0FDFFD4C1D160F68">
and wetted after wards insidely with the above-men|tioned lead-water. Cover it; then put it in the furnace of a glass-maker, three or four days, or in a wind-fur|nace for one day only. At the end of that time you shall find you have got a very fine white paste, which you may cut as you like.</P>
<P N="3">3. To make this paste yellow, you are to substitute, iron filings for the copper ones: and to imitate rubies, substitute cinnabar.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>II. To make Emeralds, and other sorts of precious stones.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Dissolve some alkaline salt in common water, and filter it through a hat; then recover your salt by means of evaporation. Dissolve it again, filter and evaporate as before, and repeat this operation three different times. Then pulverise this salt after the third evaporation, and put it by. Dissolve one ounce of verdigrise in vinegar, and strain it; then put it by likewise. Have next, fine crystal, which you grind and sift very fine in an apothe|cary's sieve, and after the same manner as they do the prepared crystal.</P>
<P N="2">2. To that ounce of the said verdigrise, put two and a half of the crystal powder, and two only of the pulve|rised alkaline salt.</P>
<P N="3">3. These three powders put in a small glazed pipkin, and lute it so well that no air can absolutely get in to the contained ingredients. Let it dry for three days or more; then put it in a potter's kiln, for twenty-four hours. After that time you will find in the pot a mat|ter perfectly similar to the diamonds in beauty, and which you may cut and work in the same manner. This composition is susceptible of admitting of all sorts of co|lours, and of being made, of course, to imitate all sorts of stones, in varying accordingly one of the drugs in the following manner.</P>
<P N="4">4. For example. If you want to make a ruby, in|stead of the above mentioned verdigrise, which make an emerald, put some cinnabar. For saphires, put lapis|lazuli;
<PB N="78" REF="029242_0058_0FDFFD4DC44AF7F0">
and for hyacinths, coral: all which are to be prepared, and used, like the verdigrise, for which they are substituted.</P>
<P N="5">5. The finest paste for making the artificial stones is to be composed with crystals, pebbles, or Bohemian to|pazes. For, if you make your composition with glass and lead only, the stones will be deficient in weight and hardness.</P>
<P N="6">6. The pebbles, and the above-mentioned topazes are calcined just the same way as crystal. You have only to mix afterwards with these powders what colour you please. Minium and verdigrise give the emerald colour. Ceruse and saffron of Mars, that of hyacinth. Minium and ceruse make a chrysolite. With the zaphera, of la|pis lazuli, or, again, with ammoniac salt and silver, you obtain a saphire. They who know how to extract the gold sulphur from that precious metal, declare that they can by means of this solary and incombustible sulphur, give the crystal the most beautiful colour of rubies.</P>

Now, in an iron spoon with a long handle, make red hot your crystal, or calce|dony-stone; and when red hot, throw them in the said tartar water. If you take them out, redden and extin|guish them again six or seven times in the same manner, they will be perfectly well calcined. After having re|duced them into an impalpable powder, you may use that powder, in due proportion, in whatever mixture you will, to give them a colour according to what you want to make. If for emeralds, for example, the composition prescribed in the above article will do very well.</P>
<P N="2">2. Observe however, that if you intend to make eme|ralds, the pulverisation of your calcined crystals must be made in a brass mortar; while, if you intend to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> must use an iron mortar, and have a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to pound the crystals in a brass one.</P>

Some go still farther, and rather choose gold filings; fancifully thinking, that as this metal is far more pre|cious than the other, it is likewise infinitely better for the operation, and ought of course to be preferred. But, deceived in their conjectures, as they must unavoid|ably be, who have no other guide to direct their judg|ment, experience has since shewn, that maugre the inferi|ority of steel to gold, yet the former metal's filings are for the following purpose, a great deal superior to those of the latter.</P>
<P N="3">3. Bury your sapphire in a crucible, under steel fil|ings. Set it on the fire, and let the filings become so red hot as to be nearly melting, but you must take care they do not melt. Let your sapphire lay thus under the filings, and in that condition, a little while. These take them off, and pick out your sapphire, to examine it. If its whiteness does not please you yet, set it is the filings again, and renew this operation not only once more, but as many times as you will find it neces|sary to make it acquire that beautiful degree which you want your sapphire to have.

Put your white sapphire in this paste, with which wrap it up well, and set it a-drying in the oven. The this ball all round, and at one of the ends of it, with a very fine wire. Then bury this ball in a crucible, under the first mixture of steel filings and enamel powder, and put it on the fire, which you will push to the degree of nearly fusing the enamel, taking care, however, it shall not positively happen. Then with one end of the wire, pull out the sapphire from the crucible, and see whether its whiteness please you or not.

But as the action of these metallic minerals, which tinge crystal in that operation, is stronger, in proportion to the quantity of similar spirits they meet with in ascend|ing to the top of the crucible, so the colors acquire also more strength and vivacity.</P>

Add a little water to it, so as to make a sort of paste with it, of the consistence of colors on pallets for painting. When it is in that state, put it in a little square tin mould, with turned-up edges. Press well your paste down in it, and smoothen the surface. As soon as you see it begins to dry, stamp on it the seal of which you want to obtain the impres|sion, and taking it off skilfully from the tripoly paste, let this dry thoroughly. When you find it is perfectly hard, and the strokes of the seal are solids, put on the impression some powder of crystal, or any artificial stone you please, whether red, green, blue, or any other co|lor. Then, with a metal pipe, blow on that powder the flame of a candle, or a lamp, till the crystal is per|fectly melted. When done, lay something, such as a small iron pallet, of nearly the size of the seal, on the melted paste, and press it gently to make it take the better the impression, and all the turns of the design, and then let it cool.

Con|tinue so doing till there shall not remain any of the pearl powder at all, and that both the pearls and the water shall have reciprocally impregnated the substance one of another.</P>
<P N="2">2. Things being so far conducted, by the lid on the glass vessel, in which the liquor is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and set it
<PB N="107" REF="029242_0072_0FDFFD8C5CBB7030">
in the sun for the space of twenty days. At the end of which term, you may take notice of another liquor, like a greasy oil, swimming on the top of the former. Skim it carefully with a silver or glass spoon, and keep it se|parately in a phial, to use it in proper time, as shall be directed.</P>
<P N="3">3. This being done, take the vessel in which the for|mer liquor, you have just skimmed, is, and place it in balneo mariae over a gentle fire. When the water of the balneum mariae boils, you will perceive another scum rising on the top of your liquor. Skim it again, and put it carefully in another distinct phia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, to be used also when it is proper.</P>
<P N="4">4. What remains at the bottom of the vessel, after this second scum is off, is what we all know, under the denomination of Milk of Pearls; a drug much used among ladies who paint.&mdash;So far your materials are all prepared; the question is now to employ them proper|ly; and that you shall find in the following article.</P>
<P N="5">5. Take whatever kind of pearls you please, or rather happen to meet with; for, how brown, black, or imper|fect and ugly, in every respect, they may be, does not signify in the least, provided only they be round, if you want them round, or oval, if you want them of this last shape. Thread them with a fine silver wire, or swine's hair; then put them a-soaking for the space of twelve hours, in what we called just now the milk of pearls. There, they will suck that liquor, swell, and soften themselves. At the end of the prescribed term of twelve hours, take them out from that milk by their wire, and suspend them in so large a glass vessel as to have none of them touch any part of it. Cover the vessel with its lid, and set it in the sun for twelve other hours; where, and during which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, they will harden.&mdash;When they shall have been there twelve hours; put them again a soaking, for twelve hours, in the same milk as before, to swell again; then suspend them again in the sun for the same space of time, and repeat this operation, till the pearls have acquired the size you want them to have. For they will always seed and
<PB N="108" REF="029242_0073_0FDFFD8E18DAEE28">
swell themselves with that cream, whenever you put them into it.&mdash;When, therefore, they have soaked in it for the last time, and been dried afterwards for twelve hours in the sun, then is the time of putting them a-soak|ing for another twelve hours in the second stuff which you skimmed from the milk of pearls, while it was in the balneo mariae. Then set them again in the sun for twelve hours.&mdash;This term being also over, put them a-soaking in the first sort of greasy oil, which you skim|med for the first time from the liquor, after the twenty hours of its having been exposed in the sun. And when they shall have remained there for twelve hours, and been again exposed after that, for twelve more out of it, in the sun, as usual, the whole operation is then en|tirely at an end. You have then got very fine, and exceedingly good pearls; well shaped, either in the round or oval form; not sophistic, but true and natu|ral; and you may have your own price for them.</P>
<P N="6">6. Of the mercurial water mentioned, and which is the chief thing, indeed, in this operation, we must safe|ly aver, that it is a secret known by very few, and to those only who are well versed in the great Art of Chymistry, and perfectly conversant with the best au|thors on that subject. This secret is so important, and of such moment, that we do not think it proper, nay we must even say prudent, to make it so common as this volume would unavoidably do by its publication. The manipulation formerly described will undoubtedly af|ford no little pleasure and satisfaction to those who are acquainted with the process of making mercurial wa|ter, and who do not know, perhaps, the precious qua|lity it is invested with, of composing or swelling pearls.</P>

<P N="1">1. YOU must first lay on the wood two coats of Troyes-white, diluted with size-water. Next lay over these a third coat of ceruse. Then having mixed the color you want with turpentine oil, add the varnish to it, and lay it on the wood, previously prepar|ed as follows.</P>
<P N="2">2. Polish the wood, first with shavegrass or horsetail, and then with pounce-stone. Lay afterwards six or se|ven coats of color mixed with varnish, allowing after each coat a sufficient time to dry, before laying on the next; then polish over the last coat with pounce-stone grinded on marble into a subtile powder. When this is done, lay two or three coats of pure white varnish. As soon as this is dry, rub it over with a soft rag dipped into fine olive oil, then rub it with tripoly reduced into subtile powder; and having wiped it with a clean piece of linen, pass a piece of wash-leather all over it.</P>

After it has been put into a fine powder, grind it on a porphyry stone, with good aquavitae till it is impalpable. Then gather it up in little cakes, which you set a drying on paper on states. When dry, if you pulverise it, you have a fine ultrama|rine of it.</P>

<HEAD>XXXV. A very good and experienced pastil to make ultramarine of.&mdash;The doses as for one pound.</HEAD>
<P>Take nut or lintseed oil, three ounces; new wax, and fine rosin, three ounces of each; rosin, one; Burgun|dy pitch, four; oliban, otherwise male frankincense, two drachms; dragon's blood, one. Melt all these ingredients, one after another, in the same order as they are here prescribed. That is to say, put in a var|nished pipkin, the oil first; and when a little warm, put in the rosin by little bits. This being dissolved, put in the chalk pulverised, pouring it gently, and by little at a time, left it should blaze. As soon as the rosin is melted, pour the rosin in powder, and by degrees likewise. Next add the Burgundy pitch, broken in small bits, for it does not admit of pulverisation; you must, notwithstanding, put it in but by little at a time; and, when all introduced and well dissolved, you add gradually the dose of dragon's blood powder, and let it dissolve like the other drugs.&mdash;Stir this composition with a stick by means of which you are to judge whether or not your pastil is done. To know it, let a drop fall from the stick into a pan of water; then, working it between your fingers, you see whether or not it stick to them. If it stick, the pastil is not done, and you must let it remain longer on the fire; then repeat the tri|al again, till it does not stick to your fingers, as a proof of its being arrived at its degree of perfection.

<HEAD>XXXVI. The way of mixing the lapis with the pastil, to make ultramarine.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Dilute as thick as you can, a quantity of the be|fore-mentioned impalpable powder of lapis lazuli, with a liquor made of two parts of aquavitae, and one of lint|seed-oil.</P>
<P N="2">2. Melt in another glazed pan, without the assistance of water, and over a gentle fire, the pastil described in the preceding receipt. Observe that your pastil be perfectly purified from any particles of water it might have carried away with it, when you threw it in wa|ter in order to form it into a ball.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the pastil is melted, throw into it the thick paste you had previously made of lapis lazuli with brandy and lintseed-oil. Stir and mix this so well, that the whole be most perfectly united and incorpora|ted. Then let it remain twenty-four hours, and cover it well for fear of any dust getting at it.</P>
<P N="4">4. After the said twenty-four hours are elapsed, put in this pan a quantity of luke-warm water, proporti|onable to that of the matter, and work well the whole together with two wooden pestles, till the water be|comes quite blue, which you will immediately decant off into a china bason, and cover carefully for fear of dust.</P>
<P N="5">5. Put new luke-warm water again on the same pastil. Work it a-new as before, and proceed the same as for the first time&mdash;Repeat this operation as many times as you find the water coming blue, and till you perceive it begins to turn grey or white, which is a convincing proof that there is no more any thing good in the pastil.&mdash;Be careful to range in order the different bowls in

which you have decanted your tinged waters; and, to avoid mistakes, number them by first, second, third, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="6">6. Let these waters settle, and when quite clear as when you put them in, decant them again with all the gentleness possible, each into another similar vessel, for fear of losing any of the ultramarine which lies fixed all round the sides and bottom of the bowls, and might be, though never so little, carried off with the decanted waters. When these waters are duly decanted off, co|ver again, carefully, the bowls, for fear of the dust, and let the ultramarine, which lies round them, dry perfectly. When dry, brush it down gently to the bot|tom, with a new and soft hair brush, and gather your powders separately with the same numbers on each parcel, agreeable to that of the bowls whence they come.</P>

<HEAD>Observations on the above process.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Ultramarine might be drawn from the pastil, by working it with the hands instead of pestles. But, as it fatigues a great deal more the articulations by that sort of working, than by the other, there is room to think, that by this mode of proceeding, each single operation might be attended with some imper|fection; which is the reason why the pestles a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> prefer|able.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some people make their lapis red-hot on the bare coals, then steep it in distilled vinegar, repeating this several times till it becomes fryable.</P>
<P N="3">3. But, it is much preferable to make it red hot in a crucible; because, should the fire make it split, the bits will remain in the crucible. Now it need not be

<HEAD>XXXVII. Another secret to compose a fine blue. fit for washing, in drawings, instead of ultramarine, which is both too dear, and too strong, to be used for that purpose.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Gather in the summer, a large quantity of blowart which grows in the fields among the corn. Pick well their blue leaves off, and throw the remainder away. Have luke-warm water impregnated with impalpable powder of alum. Put the above pickled blue leaves in|to a marble mortar with a sufficient quantity of that alum water, to soak them only. Then, with either a wooden or marble pestle, pound them, till the whole is so mashed, as to give easily all the juice by expression through a new cloth. When you strain it, you must do it over a china or glass bowl, in which there is wa|ter impregnated with the whitest gum-arabic you can find.</P>
<P N="2">2. Observe that you must not put much alum in the first water, if you are desirous of preserving the bright|ness of the color; for, by putting too much of that ingredient, as wellas of the water impregnated with it, you darken the tone of the color.</P>
<P N="3">3. Note. By means of the same process, you may likewise draw the colors from every flower which has any great eclat. You must not neglect to pound them with alum water, which prevents the color from suf|fering any alternation; as it sometimes happens as the very first bruise.</P>

Next to this, pound them in a marble mortar, with a little luke-warm water, impregnated with alum. When pounded, express the juice through a new cloth, over a china bowl. Then mix some gum-arabic water with it.</P>
<P N="2">2. If you want a tone of color different from the natural color of the flower, you may change it by on|ly adding after the flowers are pounded, a little quick|lime dust in the mortar, and give two or three strokes of a pestle mortar to the whole; then strain it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Note. If you should pound these flowers in a wooden mortar, you must be cautioned at least to take care it should not be one of walnut-tree wood, because it is apt to tarnish the colors, and destroy their bright|ness, which is one of the chief things always required in colors.</P>

<HEAD>CVII. The true process used in the composition of the Eastern carmine.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Have a glazed pipkin, quite new, holding fully two English quarts. Wash it with boiling water, then fill it with spring or river water, very clean and filter|ed. Set it on blasting coals, and when it begins to boil throw in a drachm of chouan in fine powder, which you boil very quick for near a quarter of an hour. Then strain this water through a cloth washed in lye, and not with any soap, and receive it in another new glazed pipkin, cleaned and washed as the first. Put this on a fire, not quite so blasting as the first; and, when it begins to give signs of boiling, throw in one ounce of the finest cochineal, pulverised very fine. Stir often with a little hazel-tree stick, stripped of its peel and let boil gently for near a quarter of an hour; then throw in sixteen grains of autour, in subtile powder, and keep it on the same degree of fire, boiling for half a quarter of an hour. Take it off from the fire, and throw in sixteen grains of Roman alum in powder, then strain it immediately through a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lean cloth, washed with lye, and no soap, and receive it in two different large china bowls, capable to contain more than three pints of li|quor a-piece, new and perfectly clean. Place these in a room, where they will be perfectly free from dust, and let them rest there for a week, that the carmine may have time to make a precipitaion.</P>
<P N="2">2. At the end of this term, decant out gently your tincture into two other China bowls, of the same size as the two former, and as perfectly clean, taking great care in decanting, to do it so gently that the liquor may not carry the carmine along with it. Then letting dry in a shade the carmine, which shall have been left in the bottom of your bow's, gather it with a little brush, and keep it very cleary.</P>
<P N="3">3. Eight or ten days afterwards, more or less, de|cant again the tincture which is in the second bowls, in|to a new varnished pipkin, then dry and gather the
<PB N="149" REF="029242_0093_0FDFFDDC1CB68E30">
carmine, which is at the bottom, in the same manner as the first.</P>
<P N="4">4. Then set the pipkin, in which the carmine has been decanted for this second time, on the fire, and va|porise the liquor gently, till the ground remains in the consistence of a pap. This pap-like ground must then be put into several small china cups, and placed in the sun to dry, which will procure you again another carmine darker, and much less valuable than the first.

Dip your sponge into very clear and pure water, and there work it well with your hand, soaking and pressing it alternately till you have rendered it very soft. Then press and squeeze it quite dry in a clean towel. Now, if you only approach it to the superfice of the tinctured water, it will immediately fill itself with it, and you may squeeze it into another empty bowl, thus repeating the same process, till you have got it all out of the first bowls; taking care every time you approach it to the surface of the water, lest it should touch the carmine; for no doubt but it would carry some along with the water.</P>

If you dissolve one drachm of mineral crystal into this tincture, by boiling it to that effect for five or six minutes, it will help a great deal the precipitation of the color, from which you take out afterwards the water with a sponge, as we said before. Should the water you have thus drawn out be still tinged, you may add some more mineral crystal to it again; boil it as be|fore, strain it through a cloth, and let it settle. By these means you will have very fine crimson carmine.</P>

<HEAD>CVIII. The process observed in making the lake.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Take one pound of Alicant kali, or Bril-ash, pul|verised, which put in a kettle with four quarts of spring|water. Boil the whole for the space of a quarter of an hour, keeping stirring all the while with a stick, then take it off from the fire, and let it cool, so as to be able to keep your finger in it without scalding. When it is in that state, throw it in a jelly-bag, made of cloth, to filter it, and render it perfectly clear. Put it, next, in a new glazed pipkin, with one ounce of finely pulverised cochineal, previously diluted by degrees with some of the same lye. Set it a-boiling for half a quarter of an hour, and never cease to stir with a stick all the while it is on the fire.&mdash;You may, if you chuse, add one drachm of terra merita in fine powder, at the same time with that of the cochineal; it will render your lake the redder.&mdash;When the whole shall have boiled the pre|scribed time of half a quarter of an hour, take it off the fire, and let the tincture cool, in order to pass it through a cloth, or the above-mentioned jelly-bag. Set a large stone pan under the bag to receive the tincture which shall filter; and, when all is well drained, take the bag, turn it to throw off all the dregs, and wash it well, in|side and outside, in clean water, and wring it quite dry.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now hang again this same bag at two feet distance, or thereabouts, above the pan wherein the tincture did run, and now is. Dissolve, in about two quarts of warm spring-water, six ounces of Roman alum well pounded, that it may more readily melt. When this dissolution is no more than lukewarm, have somebody to pour it for you in the above jelly-bag, while you stir with a stick what runs from it into your tincture, and do so, till the whole is passed through, and the tincture froths no more.&mdash;Then wring well your bag again, to express all the alum's dissolution from it into your tincture, and wash it again afterwards in clear water, as before.</P>

If, how|ever, after having repeated this three or four times, it should continue to run tinged, dissolve two or three ounces more of pulverised Roman alum in about two quarts of that very tinged water, then stir and mix it well in the whole quantity of tincture, then pour it again in the bag where the lake is, re-pouring again and again what shall run first from it, till it runs quite clear, and does not even stain the paper.</P>

twenty-four hours, after which, set the copper on the fire, and boil it for one quarter of an hour. Then filter this lye through a cloth jelly-bag, and receive the fil|tration in a stone pan.</P>
<P N="2">2. If, at first, the lye did not run quite clear, filter it till it does: and then, changing the pan only under|neath, pour what ran thick in the first pan in the bag again. When all is new filtered and clear, put it in the copper again, which must have been previously well washed, and set it on the fire to boil. When it does boil, throw in two pounds of fine scarlet flocks, which you boil to whiteness. Then filter again this lye tinged with scarlet color, in the before-mentioned jelly-bag, and press well the flocks, that there may not remain any color in them.</P>
<P>Observe, that in order your bag may serve you both for the lake and tincture without being at the trouble of cleansing it, you must not filter through it the second lye in which the scarlet is. For should you pour this lye from the copper, directly into it, the scarlet flocks would undoubtedly run with the lye, which would give you an infinite deal of trouble to get out of the bag, af|ter the filtering of the tincture. And the least bit of it would entirely spoil the lake. Therefore, to avoid all these inconveniencies, strain your second lye either through a cloth suspended by its four corners, or through another bag by itself.</P>
<P N="3">3. While the tincture is filtering, get the copper well scoured, cleaned, and wiped dry. Put the filtered tinc|ture in it. Dossolve, over the fire, and in a copper or glazed earthen saucepan, half-a-pound of Roman alum in one quarter of spring water. Then strain it quickly, and, while warm, pour it in your tincture, keeping stirring all the while, and afterwards, till all the froth has quite subsided. Boil, next, all together for the space of half a quarter of an hour. Then throw it in the same bag that filtered your first lye, and receive the filtration into a clean stone pan.</P>

<P>Begin first, by laying on the intended wall a coat of sifted river sand, mixed with old sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cked line pul|verised and sifted also. This coat is not to be laid on the wall, but in proportion as you paint; therefore, you are to prepare no more at a time than you are sure to paint over in one day, while fresh and moist.&mdash;The bo|dy of the wall on which you lay this coat must previ|ously be pargetted with plaister, or with a mortar made with sand and lime. And if the paintings are to be ex|posed to the injuries of the weather, the mason's work must be made of bricks or free stones very dry.</P>
<P N="2">2. Before you begin to paint, you must prepare your designs in their full intended size on paper, and chalk them one after another, as you go on, on the wall, in proportion as you work, and no longer than half an hour after the coat of prepared river sand above men|tioned has been laid on, and well polished with the trowel.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="157" REF="029242_0097_0FDFFDEC5F763EB8">
3. In these sorts of paintings all the compounded and artificial-made colors, as well as most of the minera ones, are rejected. They use hardily any other but earths, which may preserve their hue, and defend it from being burnt by the lime. And, that the work may for ever preserve its beauty, you must observe to employ them quickly, while the coat underneath is still moist; and never, as some do, touch them over after they are once dry, with colors diluted in yolks of eggs, glue, or gum, because these colors always blacken, and never keep that vivacity and brilliancy those have which have been laid at first when the ground was moist. Besides, in the case of paintings exposed in the air, this sort of touching up is never good for any thing; and, too often, scales off in a very short time.</P>

<HEAD>CXV. Directions for the choice, use, and composition, of the colors employed for the above purpose.</HEAD>
<P>The colors made use of, for the above purpose, are such as follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. The white. This is made with a lime which has been slacked for a great while, and white marble in subtile powder, mixed in about equal quantities. Some|times no more than a quarter part of marble dust is re|quired; which depends entirely on the quality of the lime, and cannot be known but when you come to use it; for if there be too much marble, the white will turn black.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ochre, or brown red, is a natural earth.</P>
<P N="3">3. Yellow ochre is also a natural earth, which be|comes red if you burn it.</P>
<P N="4">4. The obscure yellow, or yellow ochre, which is also a natural earth, and slimy, is to be got by the streams of iron-mines. It receives a fine color from cal|cination.</P>
<P N="5">5. Naples yellow, is a sort of filth which gathers round the mines of brimstone: and, though it be used in fresco-paintings, its color nevertheless, is not so good
<PB N="158" REF="029242_0098_0FDFFDEDF8998C38">
as that which is made of earth, or, yellow ochre and white mixed together.</P>
<P N="6">6. The purple red is a natural earth, the product of England, and it is used instead of lake.</P>
<P N="7">7. The terverte, from Verona in Lombardy, is a na|tural earth, which is very hard and dark. There is also another sort of terverte.</P>
<P N="8">8. The ultramarine, or, lapis lazuli, is a hard stone, and of a very difficult preparation. This color of the manner of preparing which we shall give (&sect; ix. Art. cxxxiii.) a just and precise account, subs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">sts and keeps itself fine much longer than any other color. It is not to be grinded, but diluted only on the pallet with oil. As it is very dear, you may spare using it in fresco paint|ings, and supply it by smalt, which answers the same purpose, particularly in skies.</P>
<P N="9">9. Smalt is a blue color, which has very little sub|stance. It is used in great landscapes, and stands very well the open air.</P>
<P N="10">10. Umber is an obscure earth. It requires to be calcined in an iron box, if you want to make it finer, browner, and of a better look.</P>
<P N="11">11. Cologn earth is a sort of rusty black, which is apt to discharge, and to turn red.</P>
<P N="12">12. The earthen black, is a black which comes from Germany.&mdash;There is also another sort of German black, which is a natural earth, and makes a bluish black, like that of charcoal. This sort of black is that which is used for making printers' ink. There is another still, which is made with burnt wine-lye.</P>

<HEAD>CXVI. Directions for painting in oil on a wall.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Method I.</HEAD>
<P>You must, when the wall is perfectly dry, give it two or three coats of boiling oil, or more, if necessary, so that the face of the wall may remain greasy, and can soak in no more; then lay another coat of siccative co|lors, which is done as follows: Grind some common whitening, or chalk, red ochre, and other sorts of earth, pretty stiff, and lay a coat of it on the wall. When this is very dry, then draw and paint on it whatever you will, observing to mix a little varnish among your co|lors, that you may not be obliged to varnish them after|wards.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="117" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>CXVII. Method 2.</HEAD>
<P>There are some who prepare the wall another way, in order it may sooner dry, and that the dampness should not occasion the colors to scale, as it sometimes happens, on account of the oil which resists it, and prevents it from sweating out through the pores of the wall. They make a cement with the lime and marble dust, or grind|ed tiles; this they lay on the wall with the trowel, with which they smoothen it, and then give it a coat of lint|seed oil with a large brush. In the next place, they prepare a composition of Greek pitch, mastich, and coarse varnish, which they boil all together in a pipkin, and lay afterwards, first with a brush, then smoothen with a hot trowel, in order to spread it better, and more equal|ly. When this is done, they lay on the wall the coat of siccative colors above mentioned, then draw their de|sign and paint.</P>

<DIV4 N="118" TYPE="method">

<PB N="160" REF="029242_0099_0FDFFDEF9446F2D0">
or iron scum, all in equal quantities. Beat and incorporate all this together, with whites of eggs and lintseed oil, and it will make so strong a cement as can|not be equalled by any thing else. Its nature is such, that while you are laying it on, you must not stop and leave it till you have finished, otherwise it will assuredly crack in every one of those places where you shall have resumed your work.

<DIV4 N="120" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>CXX. Directions for painting in oil on canvas.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Chuse a fine and smooth tick or cloth, which nail on a frame. Pass over it first a coat of size, and when dry, rub it over with a pounce stone to eat off all the knobs and knots. The size which you put first on the cloth is intended to lay down all the threads, and fill up all the small holes, that the color may not pass through.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the cloth is dry, lay on a coat of simple co|lor, which may not destroy the others; for example, brown-red, which is a natural earth, full of substance, and lasting. You may mix it, if you like, with a little white lead, it will dry the sooner. To grind this co|lor, they use nut or lintseed oil; and in order to lay it as thin as it is possible, they use a large knife made on purpose.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="161" REF="029242_0099_0FDFFDEF9446F2D0">
3. When this color is dry, you are to rub it again with the pounce stone, to render it smoother. Then lay another coat of white lead and charcoal black, to render the ground greyish. In this, as well as in the preceding coats, you must take care to put as little co|lor as you possibly can, to prevent the cloth from crack|ing, and for the better preservation of the colors which are to be laid afterwards in painting. For it is proper to observe, that could there be no ground at all laid on the canvas of a picture, previous to the painting of it, and should one paint directly on the bare cloth, without any other preparation at all, the colors would appear much more to their advantage, and preserve their bright|ness much longer. A proof of this assertion may be found in the practice of Paul Veronese, and Titian, who used to impregnate their canvas with water colors only, and paint afterwards in oil over that ground. This custom of theirs has not a little contributed to render their pieces more lively and bright, because the ground in water color draws, and soaks the oil off the colors, which must render them much finer, since the greatest cause of their dulness arises from nothing but the oil with which they are diluted.</P>
<P N="4">4. They therefore, who wish to see their works keep bright and lively, use as little oil as possible, and keep their colors more stiff, mixing a little oil of spike amongst them, which indeed vaporises very soon, but assists in rendering them more fluid and tractable in working.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another cause of the colors not keeping a long while their beauty, is when they are too much torment|ed on the pallet, as it often happens that painters con|fuse them in working. Whenever this is the case, they must needs be hurt, as there are many which adul|terate, and other wise corrupt the others, and spoil the vivacity of their taint. Therefore, we cannot recom|mend too much to be cautious and clean in employing them, taking care to lay them as distinct and separate as possible, each by themselves, on the pallet, without mix|ing them too much with the brush or pencil. Never mingle together those colors which are enemies to each
<PB N="162" REF="029242_0100_0FDFFDFA0A4DF468">
other, as all the blacks are, particularly the lampblack; but as much as possible, try to use them separately by themselves. Nay, when there is an occasion of giving more strength to some parts of a picture, stay till it is dry before you touch it up again, if those colors are obnoxious to the others with which you are to do it. Therefore he shows his judgment in painting, who is not precipitate in laying his colors on his pictures, but lays them thick enough, and covers at several times the carnations, which, in terms of art is called empater.</P>
<P N="6">6. As to what concerns the first laying of grounds on canvas, in water colors, it is a method not commonly practified, because they may scale, and cannot be rolled without some difficulty. For this reason, the custom prevails of grounding the canvas with oil colors. But when the canvas is good and very fine, the less color you can lay on for that purpose, the better. Take care on|ly those colors and oils are good.&mdash;The lead which some painters use the help their colors to dry the sooner, soon destroys their brightness and beauty.</P>

Therefore, without entering into a repetition of those already mentioned in Art. cxiii. we shall content our|selves with making only the following addition to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. White lead; this color is made with lead which you bury. Several years after, this lead turns into some sort of stakes, which are of a very fine white.&mdash;Though this white exists in painting, and is in positive use, it has always, however, a very bad quality, which the oil corrects a little, when you grind it on the stone.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="163" REF="029242_0100_0FDFFDFA0A4DF468">
3. Ceruse, or flake white; this is a sort of rust ga|thered from lead, but of a coarser nature than the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. Massicot; there are two sorts of this color. The one is yellow, and the other is white. It is made with calcined lead.</P>
<P N="5">5. Orpine, otherwise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ripigment. It is used cal|cined and non-calcined.&mdash;To calcine it they put it in an iron-box, or in a pot w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> stopped. But few either calcine it, or even use it at all, as the fumes are mortal, and it is very dangerous to use it.</P>
<P N="6">6. Black lead. This comes from lead mines. They make very little use of it, because it is a bad color of itself, besides that it is a great enemy to the other.</P>
<P N="7">7. Cinnabar, or vermilion. This color is drawn from the mines where they gather quicksilver. As it is a mineral, it is the reason why it is does not resist the impression of the air, nor the injuries of the wea|ther.</P>
<P N="8">8. Lake. This color, which is an artificial made one, is composed with cochineal, or with scarlet flocks; or again, Brasil wood, and some other sorts of woods. There are several sorts of lake made. It does not stand the weather.</P>
<P N="9">9. Blue verditure and green verditure. It is very seldom used in any other works but landscapes.</P>
<P N="10">10. Indigo. This color is generally used for mak|ing skies, or draperies; when properly used, it keeps its beauty a great while. You must not mix it with too great a quantity of oil, but lay it a little thick and dark, bucause it discharges very much. They use it with great success diluted with gum water. It is a good color for the composition of greens.</P>
<P N="11">11. Brown-pink, otherwise called stil-de-grain. This color is drawn from what is called French berries, which they soak and boil, then mix the result with vine-wood ashes, or calcined white chalk, to give it a proper consistence. When this is done, it must be strained through a very fine cloth.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="164" REF="029242_0101_0FDFFE8699ADEDC8">
12. Lamp-black. This is a bad color, but handy to paint black draperies.</P>
<P N="13">13. Ivory-black. This black is made indifferently with common bones, as well as ivory, burnt. Apelles discovered this sort of black, if we believe Pliny, Book xxxv. Chap. v.</P>
<P N="14">14. Verdigrise. This is the most pernicious of all the colors, and capable to ruin a whole picture, if there were ever so little in the color with which the canvass is first impregnated. It is however of a very agreeable look. They sometimes calcine it to prevent its malig|nant effect; but it is as dangerous to use it that way as orpine; and it is an undoubted truth that, however well prepared as it may be, it must be employed alone by itself, for it would spoil all the colors with which it may be mixed. The chief reason why they use it is, that it dries very much, and for that purpose they mix a little of it with the blacks, which can never dry with|out some assistance of that kind,</P>
<P>N. B. You must be very careful never to use, for other colors, the pencils with which you shall have laid any verdigrise.</P>

<DIV4 N="122" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>CXXII. Which oils are used in painting.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The best oils which are used in painting are those of nut and lintseed. To render the colors more fluid, and spread more easily under the pencil, they use also oil of spike. This oil absorbs itself in the canvass, and leaves the colors without any gloss. They use it also for cleaning pictures; but you must take care it should not carry the colors away with it. It is made with the flowers of a plant called Spikenard or Lavender Spike.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is another oil drawn from Mel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ian-rosin, firs, &amp;c. wherefore it is called oil of turpentine. This sort of oil is also very good for touching up pictures; but it is chiefly good for mixing with ultramarine, and

the different sorts of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lts, because it serves to make them spread with more facility, and evaporates almost immediately. When you make use of this oil, the less there is of any other oil in the color, the better, as they all serve only to make it turn yellow.</P>
<P N="3">3. There are other oils again which are denominated ficcative oils, because they serve to dry up the others the sooner. These are many in number and species. One sort is nothing but the oil of nut, boiled with gold litharge and a whole onion peeled, which is taken off after boiling; this onion serving only to exsiccate the greasy parts of the oil, and to clarify it. Another sort is made with azure in powder, or smalt, boiled in oil of nut. When the whole is boiled, you must let it settle, and then skim off the top. It is fittest for dil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ting the white, and such of the other colors as you want to pre|serve purest and nearest.</P>

<P>N. B. There are many who instead of a glass retort, use earthen, or stone ones, which all equally bear the fire. They make a slow fire for about half an hour, then increase and continue it till they see the red fumes ari|sing.&mdash;Both methods are equally good, and answer per|fectly the same purpose.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="128" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>CXXVIII. Another, very different, method of making cinnabar.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Melt, in a pipkin, some brimstone over a slow fire. When melted, take it out, and with one hand squeeze a
<PB N="168" REF="029242_0103_0FDFFDFF243ABFF0">
knot of mercury between your fingers through a cloth into the melted sulphur; and with the other, stir well till the lump is become quite cold and black.</P>
<P N="2">2. Put this into a subtile powder, with which having filled the fourth part of a very long retort, you will lute it well, and very exactly, with a good lute. Place it next, without a receiver, for two or three hours, on a very mild fire; then introduce into the retort a long funnel which will reach as far as the matter, and even to the bottom of the retort; through that funnel pass a long spatula, which touching also the bottom of the retort, should come out of the funnel five or six inches. In the middle of the spatula let there be a bung of lute round it, well dried, which will stop so well the retort as to prevent it from breathing any air. When all this is done, push on the fire to a pretty smart degree, and keep it for five hours.</P>
<P N="3">3. At the end of this term, draw out the spatula, and introduce, through the same way that it came out, two spoonsfull, or thereabouts, of your prepared pow|der of brimstone and quicksilver, with which you intend to make cinnabar, and which you shall, for that pur|pose, have kept warm in a vessel by the corner of the fire, that it may not cool the retort in going in, and thereby retard the operation.</P>
<P N="4">4. Continue so to do, adding every hour new matter, by means of the drawing out the spatula to introduce the new powder, and replacing it quickly, till you have increased your lump of cinnabar to the quantity of one hundred weight.&mdash;The spatula's use in the neck of the retort is to prevent its filling itself up by the sublima|tion of the matter, which would occasion two evils, that of breaking of the retort, and of preventing the introduction of new powder to increase the lump of cinnabar. So that, at the same time it keeps a free passage into the retort, it nevertheless stops it too, by means of the ball of lute which is round it.&mdash;But, in the last place, in order there should remain no vacancy in the middle of the cinnabar-lump, take off the spatula for the last time, and inject fresh powder, then, without
<PB N="169" REF="029242_0103_0FDFFDFF243ABFF0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">-introducing the spatula, stop the retort with a lump of lute only&mdash;Thus, the longer you keep the fire up, the harder and redder the lump of cinnabar becomes.</P>
<P N="5">5. Observations.&mdash;This cinnabar is the very same which empyricks use in fumigation, along with aloes, wood, myrrh and other aromatics, to excite the mouth, or belly, flux, which they reiterate two or three times, or till that flux is abundant enough to procure the cure of the venereal disorder.&mdash;It is the same also which painters make use of; and which enters into the com|position of sealing wax.</P>
<P>There are alchymists who maintain, they can with the natural or fictitious cinnabar we have just mentioned re|solve irreductibly either gold or silver; because they are of opinion, that these metals have sprung from it in the entrails of the earth. But it is proper to tell them here, that they would not perhaps commit so gross an error, if they attempted this process with the cinnabar, which the philosopher endeavors to draw from quick gold and silver, and which are known to him alone. To which reflection I shall add, that he to whom quick gold and silver are known can do with them also every thing as with the metals; but as the old saying is, <HI>Non-licit om|nibus adire Chorintam.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CXXXIII. Just. The general manipulation of the whole process; each single part of which shall be treated of in particular, afterwards.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Take one pound, our whatever quantity you please, of lapis-lazuli. Let your stones be well chosen, and of that sort which are streaky with gold. Try their quality, whether good or bad, which is done thus. Break one bit of it, set it on red-hot coals, and blow as hard as you can for an hour, then take it off and let it cool. If in touching it, it drop like mould or dust, it is a sign it is not worth any thing; but if it remains hard and preserves its color, it is good. When you have thus made yourself sure of the quality of the stone, break it all in small knobs, put them in a crucible on a melting fire, which by strength of bellows you push on for an hour and a quarter. When this is done throw them into the strongest double distilled wine vinegar. When they are thus extinguished in it, take them out to dry, and prepare the following water.</P>
<P N="2">2. Boil a little raw white honey with two pints of water in a glazed pipkin. Skim it so long as there comes any scum on it; then take it off to cool; and, when cold, dissolve in it the bigness of a nut of the best dragon's blood reduced into a subtile powder. Run this dissolution through a white cloth into a glazed earthen pot. Observe to make your water (with that dragon's blood) neither too red, nor too clear, but to keep a just medium between both, that the azure may take a finer hue.&mdash;With this liquor grind, for the space of an hour and a half, your above-mentioned lapis lazuli, then ga|ther it up into a large glazed vessel, and then let it dry in the shade, but guard off the sun, otherwise it will un|doubtedly lose its color. When it is perfectly dry, grind it a-new into a very fine powder, then pack and keep it tied very closely in fine white linen. Then proceed to the following paste.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="172" REF="029242_0105_0FDFFE0A54FCB9F8">
3. Take two ounces of the best white rosin, an equal quantity of Greek pitch, and the same quantity again of mastich, lintseed oil, turpentine, and virgin wax. Powder what is powderable, and cut small what is not. Put all into a new glazed pipkin, and boil it to perfec|tion; which you know by letting a drop fall into cold water and taking it out with your fingers. For if it do not stick to your fingers, it is done to perfection, and if it do, it is not.&mdash;When, therefore, it is done to perfection, run it quite hot through a sheer-cloth in|to a pan of cold water, where in leave it till perfectly hard: then take it out and let it dry. When you want to incorporate it with the powder, proceed as follows.</P>
<P N="4">4. Cut this paste into small bits, and put it to melt over the fire in a well tinned sauce pan. When the contents come to make a noise, throw in two ounces of oil of bitter almonds, and let it boil for about ten minutes. In the mean while have your lapis-lazuli powder ready in a vessel then pour over it gently, and little at a time, what is boiling in the pipkin, observing to stir carefully, while you pour, in order to incorporate well this liquid with the powder, which be|ing done let the whole cool. Then, having rubbed your hands with oil of olive, take this composition and work it well in order to incorporate all perfectly: and, after having given it the form of a loaf, put it in a glazed ves|sel to keep it for use.</P>
<P N="5">5. When you want to draw the azure from it. (which must be less than twelve days after this last opera|tion, and it has laid in this glazed vessel,) begin first by making a strong lye with vine-wood ashes, which you strain through a flannel bag, to get it very clear. Then putting it, in a copper boiler, on the fire, till it is so hot as not to be able to keep the hand in without scalding, you pour some of it on what quantity of the above paste you please, to extract the azure from, and stir it gently till it begins to come out. When, by thus stirring your paste in this lye this last is become well charged with the color, decant it out into another glazed vessel, of which sorts of vessels you must have a

Then pour again some more warm lye on your paste, and work it the same as before, till this new lye seems sufficiently charged with taint, and decant it out again into another well glazed vessel. Pour new warm lye again on your paste, and proceed as before, continuing so to do till the paste gives no more taint to the lye.</P>
<P N="6">6. Observe, that when the lapis is good, you loose but four ounces of it out of one pound, and that you ex|tract twelve ounces of azure in the following propor|tion. Five ounces of very fine ultramarine, by the first washes; four middling, out of the second washes; and three base ones, by the last washes.

And, when they seem to you very bright, put them a-drying in a shade, but not in the sun, in a room perfectly free from dust.</P>
<P N="7">7. When it has been thus perfectly dried, take a glass of brandy, in which you have put a-soaking a little Brazil wood, and asperge the ultramarine with that tinged brandy, stir it, and let it dry; renew the as|persion for two or three days, till the azure partici|pates a little of this taint.

If in so doing, and pulling it, it give way and does not stick to your fingers, it is ano|ther infallible sign of the cement being done enough.&mdash;Therefore, take it off from the fire, and pour it quite hot into a pecked bag, which you shall have previously steeped in warm water and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ng.

<P>There is another sort of lye which can be made to cleanse the cement of its unctuosity and grease, and which they prepare in the following manner.</P>
<P N="1">1. Take whatever quantity of calcined tartar you like. Boil it for the space of a quarter of an hour, or rather more, in clear and clean water. Then let it set|tle, and decant it into a glass bottle, which stop well, and keep it for use.</P>

<HEAD>CXXXIX. Directions for the choice of the vessels in which the most impure ultramarine is to be washed, in order to be mixed afterwards with the other a|zure.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The vessel may be either an earthen, a brass, or a copper one, it does not signify which, provided, if it be an earthen vessel, it should be well hardened in the ba|king, and finely glazed in the inside, or if brass or cop|per,

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="140" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>CXL. Observations proper to be made for dis|cerning the virtue, and good or bad qualities of the lapis lazuli, from which you intend to compose ultramarine.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1st. Trial. Wet, first, the lapis lazuli with your spittle, or even with common water, and wrap it up in a piece of fine white cloth or serge. It will thereby become of a fine lustre, and purple color, very agreeable to the sight.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Trial. If you want to know whether or not it be fine, set it on blasting charcoals, and blow them conti|nually for a good while. Then take it off from the fire. If, being cold, it has not lost much of its color, it is fine: but if it has lost none of its color, none can be finer. For it has been often observed, that the lapis which is of a superior degree of fineness, acquires, instead of losing, more color still, when put to this trial.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Trial. For the third experiment, put the lapis a-reddening on an iron plate over the fire; then extin|guish it in the best double-distilled white-wine vinegar. If, by this trial it acquire more color, itis too fine; if it only keep its own without any alteration, it is good and such as you can wish to have it.&mdash;The lapis, which on
<PB N="179" REF="029242_0108_0FDFFE18383C1A58">
that trial, acquires more color, may be worth between thirty and forty shillings an ounce. But that which keeps its own natural color after trials, is really scarce. As to that which loses the color, you can make but very middling and common ultramarine with it.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Trial. You have, when you buy it ready re|duced into powder, another trial to put it to, in order to know whether or not it be pure, and without any mixture. It is this.&mdash;Put some of this powder into a goldsmith's crucible; set it on a sufficiently strong fire as to make it red hot, then take off the crucible. If it be enamel, you will find it melted, but if it be true pulverised lapis, it will remain still a powder. If there be only a mixture of enamel with the pulverised lapis, that enamel, in melting, will gather up all the lapis powder, and when cold you will find it in a little cake at the bottom of the crucible.&mdash;This deception is ve|ry common among color-makers, from whom you buy it.</P>
<P>Remarks. The three different azures, which, by means of the cements above mentioned, you will get from the lapis, will amount all together to fifteen oun|ces for each pound of lapis; that is to say, ten oun|ces of superfine ultramarine, which will sell for twelve or thirteen ducats an ounce; three ounces of medium, which will sell for between three or four half-crowns; and two ounces of the common base sort, which will sell for one half-crown. This last is very little regarded and is called ashy; but, however, it will pay you for the expence of the cement, therefore, you will easily be able to judge of the clear profit you can make out of it.&mdash;If you employ that sort of lapis which loses all its color with the tryal of the fire and vinegar, you will either get so fine ultramarine from it, nor so much in quantity, as you can from the other. And if, as will be be mentioned hereafter you attempt to refine it, it will lose a great deal of its weight.&mdash;In a word, the best lapis is that which is streaked with numberless
<PB N="180" REF="029242_0109_0FDFFE19D5C66AC8">
veins of gold, and very shining; and this sort is that which stands bests to its color when put to the above|mentioned trials.</P>

<DIV4 N="141" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>CXLI. The method of calcining, and otherwise pre|paring, the lapis lazuli, in order to grind it after|wards.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Take that sort of lapis lazuli which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reaked with gold veins, and which has undergone the above|mentioned trials. Break it in small bits no larger than a filbert. Wash them in warm water, then set them on the fire in a crucible till red hot. When thus red|dened, take them out one by one, and extinguish them in double distilled white-wine vinegar, which shall have been previously run through a hat three or four times. Instead of such vinegar, the urine of a sound child might do, after having been run in the same manner three or four times through a hat; but the above vi|negar is preferable when it can be had. When thus ex|tinguished take them all out again from the urine, or vi|negar, and calcine them anew, then extinguish them again as before. Repeat this operation six or seven times over, that they may more easily submit to the pestle in the mortar, and not stick to it.</P>
<P N="2">2. As for the lapis which loses its color by the fire, you must dispense with the calcining of it, for as it would lose it more and more, you would at last lose both your trouble and your money.</P>
<P N="3">3. Therefore, put either that which is calcined, or that which is not, in a bronze mortar, covered over, and pound it well. Sift it through the silk sieve, co|vered also with its lid, that the most subtile part of the powder should not evaporate, as it is the best.</P>

<HEAD>CXLII. Directions for making the liquor fit to grind the lapis with, in order to make the ultramarine.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Take three half-pint tumblers full of rain water, after having run it through a hat three or four times.
<PB N="181" REF="029242_0109_0FDFFE19D5C66AC8">
Put this water into a new pipkin, and dilute as much raw honey in it as a whole shell of an egg can hold. This will render the water yellow; boil it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill it ceases to give any scum, which you shall take care to take and throw away as fast as it rises. When it is quite clear and fine, take it off from the fire, bottle it for the fol|lowing use.</P>
<P N="2">2. Have fine dragon's blood, grind it on a porphyry stone with the above-prepared honey water; put this also, when well grinded, into another bottle. Over it pour so much honey water, till it acquires a purple color. Decant it, when settled, from the ground, and keep it by itself. Such is the sort of water which is to be used to grind the lapis lazuli with.</P>
<P N="3">3. An important observation.&mdash;Should the lapis lazu|li, from which you intend to draw your ultramarine, shew some purple color of a remarkable hue and beauty, you must encourage it by means of the above-mentioned honey-water, which you must manage in the following manner. As the degree of purple you are to aim at, ought not to be deep, but rather pale and drawing to|wards the flesh more than the red, if therefore, the co|lor which comes from the lapis, should be too deep, you must diminish that of the honey-water; and if that of the stone is too pale, then render that of the liquor deeper. By these means you may make these three sorts of colors of what degree you like, by giving more or less of the liquor, and coloring this at your will, ac|cording as you see either of these proceedings requisite for your purpose.</P>
<P>Note. Chuse the dragon's blood in tears, such as the goldsmiths use, not that which is in powder. Some people work it with the above-mentioned honey-water. Others do it with the bdellium diluted in water.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="143" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>CXLIII. The method of grinding the lapis lazuli or por|phyry, and the signs which attend it.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. When the lapis is well pounded into powder, and that powder has been sifted, as before directed, set it on
<PB N="182" REF="029242_0110_0FDFFE1BE7121EF8">
a porphyry-stone, and grind it with the mullar, bath|ing it, as you grind it, with the honey-water, by little and little at a time. Keep your powder on the stone, in as small a compass as you can, not suffering it to spread much over it, which would occasion a great loss of it.</P>
<P>To grind thus, one pound of pulverised lapis, you must divide it into three parcels, and grind one of each, and no more, at a time; and it must take two hours grinding at least, to make money of it. Take care to keep your stone wet with the above-prepared honey-wa|ter all about your paste, that this should not stick to the stone while you grind it. This wetting must take, in all, about one tumbler full of the liquor for the whole pound of lapis powder. When you have grinded one part of that pound, take it out, and grind the second on the same spot on the stone, then the next, and so on, as long as you have any to grind; and be very sure that, in grinding it, you use no other water than honey|water.</P>
<P N="2">2. To know whether or not it be sufficiently grinded, take a little of it on the tip of your finger, and mash it between your fore-teeth. If you do not feel it crack as the dry powder does, then it is sufficiently grinded.&mdash;Take care not to grind it too much, lest it should lose its color, which happens sometimes; therefore grind it only pretty well.</P>
<P N="3">3. To dry the lapis, after it is grinded, put it on a clean stone, and set it to dry in the shade, not in the sun, for it would spoil it. When it looks as if it were dry, touch it with the finger, and if it rubs into powder, as mould or dirt would do, you may leave it longer. But if it resist the finger, and does not break, then it is time to take it off. It is a sign the powder is too fat of ho|ney, and requires to be purged, that it may come more easily from the cement when you shall work it.</P>
<P N="4">4. Then comes the washing of that ultramarine azure, which is performed as follows. In a great china bowl, new, without any crack or rivetting whatever, and of the most perfect polish or glaze in the inside, put your above-mentioned dried lump of paste. Over it pour the
<PB N="183" REF="029242_0110_0FDFFE1BE7121EF8">
soft lye above-described in Art. cxxxvii. and let it sur|pass the lump in the bowl by your fingers' breadth.&mdash;Then wash it well between both your hands, and dilute all entirely into that lye. When that is done, let it settle, and when the azure is entirely precipitated at the bottom, and the lye swims quite clear over it, decant it out gently by inclination, and set the azure a-drying in the shade, without moving it from the bowl. When you find it pretty dry, take it out of it carefully, spread it on the porphyry stone, to finish drying thoroughly. And when it is thoroughly dry, in that manner, give it then the cement as follows.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="144" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>CXLIV. The method of incorporating the grinded lapis lazuli with either of the strong or soft cements.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. For one pound of the lapis lazuli, prepared as di|rected in the preceding article, take one of the strong cements described in Art. cxxxiv. Rub this over with your hands, as you take it out of the water, in which you preserve it: then cut it in small bits, and put it a-melting over warm ashes, in a glazed and new pipkin. Take care that in melting, it should not fry. When this happens, put a little of our above-described lintseed oil, (see Art. cxxxvi.) and it will immediately cease to fry.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the cement is perfectly well dissolved, take that same spatula which before served you to make it with, rub it over with a little of the same oil, and stir well the melted cement with it. Then, with the other hand, taking a pound of prepared lapis lazuli, let it run slowly into your cement, with the same gentleness, and as little at a time, as you would put oil on a sallad, 'till the whole pound is put into the cement, which you must never cease to stir and mix, with the spatula, as long as you pour in the lapis. Continue still to stir after that till you are well convinced that the lapis and the ce|ment are both perfectly well mixed and amalgamated together, and not a bit or grain of the powder can be
<PB N="184" REF="029242_0111_0FDFFE1D82724820">
perceived out of the cement, and has well penetrated it.</P>
<P N="3">3. When this is done, take immediately the pot, and pour the contents, quite boiling, into a vessel full of cold water, and with the spatula take out all that is about the sides of it, and clean it well. Then, when the said cement shall be cold enough to admit touching it with your hands, rub them all over with our said pre|pared and purified lintseed oil, and take it out of the water. If, in pulling it, you see it is well tinged and coloured, it is a good omen. Work it well then, be|tween your hands, and with your fingers, for near two hours, pulling it at the same time to the length and breadth, to see whet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er or not there are not some bub|bles inclosing little parcels of powder not well divided and incorporated, and that you may spread them in the cement in working. And take this notice, that the more the paste is thus wrought, the better it will be af|terwards, as it will require less washing to get the azure out of it.</P>
<P N="4">4. When it is thus wrought, form it into a lump like a loaf of bread, and put it into a china bowl with fresh cold water, where you shall let it soak for ten or fifteen days, nay even longer, if you like, because the longer it soaks, the finer and more perfect it becomes, and the more easily too you afterwards get the azure out of it. But if it be not soaked at least twelve days, it will not do at all.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="145" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>CXLV. Directions for extracting the azure out of the cement.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Take the lump of cement, just mentioned, out of the cold water in which you left it to soak. Rub it softly over with your hands, and place it in a finely|glazed china bowl, previously wet with the aforesaid lintseed oil.</P>
<P N="2">2. Pour over it lukewarm common water which shall have been filtered through a hat before warming. Ob|serve that this water, when poured on the cement, be
<PB N="185" REF="029242_0111_0FDFFE1D82724820">
rather cool than warm, as a degree less than lukewarm is preferable to lukewarm itself; and let there be about two fingers' breadth in the bowl above the cement.&mdash;Then let it soak there for about one quarter of an hour.</P>
<P N="3">3. Have two sticks made of box, or other fine and hard wood, susceptible of a fine polish. These sticks must be made round by a turner, of a foot long or there|abouts, or longer if you like, a little thicker than one's thumb, being larger at one of the ends, and flattened in form of an almond.</P>
<P N="4">4. With these two sticks move and turn gently, at first, your cement in lukewarm water. And if, in so doing, it should stick to the bottom of the bowl, rub your hands with oil, and detach it softly and carefully, turning and returning it gently with your hands in the water, till at last it begins to be tinged with azure.&mdash;The first signs by which you know that the cement be|gins to render the ultramarine, are certain lines and streaks which appear in the water, not unlike the rays of the sun. And when this is the case, be upon your guard, and take notice that the water soon assumes a very high hue of that color, particularly at the first dis|charge of the cement, as it is always the best azure which comes first.</P>
<P N="5">5. As soon therefore as you see your water sufficiently tinged, pour it out through a sieve into the vessel with three cocks, described before in Art. cxxxix. supporting the cement on the two sticks, for fear it should stick to the bottom of the bowl, when thus left dry on it. The reason why you are advised to run this water through a sieve, is to prevent any little bit of cement which might have broken from the lump, and be loose in the water, from running along with it, and that so you might stop and rejoin it to the other.</P>
<P N="6">6. When you have thus got this first water out of the cement, pour some more water, of the same degree of warmth, rather under lukewarm than above, or even such as we said before, and proceed as before with your sticks, moving, stirring, and turning the cement in it,
<PB N="186" REF="029242_0112_0FDFFE2940C9DBC8">
and so working it as to get new azure from it, which you decant into another vessel separately from the first water.</P>
<P>Observe not to hurry or precipitate, particularly at first, the softening of the cement in the water, by work|ing it too hastily, or with too much labour on your side. It is a work of patience, which must be done as gently as possible, with case to yourself, and slowness in the working, because, if you force the azure too preci|pitately out of the cement, you will manifestly spoil all, and be a great sufferer in the end.</P>
<P N="7">7. Repeat again the same process and operation as above, to draw the third azure, and decant again this water into another vessel by itself.</P>
<P N="8">8. There is still a fourth azure which may be obtain|ed from the same cement, after the other three are got out, and this is called sandy or ashy color or grey. This requires that the water be full lukewarm, if not even a little more than so. Then you work the cement harder too with the sticks; and if it do not come out easily, give it a little of the lye described in Art. cxxxvii. which you manage as follows. First you mix one part of the soft lye with two parts of water, and see what this will do. If the cement do not render the azure yet, give it the strong lye; if neither will do, make the following preparation.&mdash;Boil vine-wood ashes in common and clearly filtered water, for one quarter of an hour. Then let it clarify, and strain it through a pecked bag. It must be strong enough to prick the tongue when you taste it. With this lye work your cement to draw the last azure from it, after making it lukewarm. When it has been once used, it is of no more service. Therefore, pour all these different wa|ters, one over the other in the same vessel, and separate|ly from the three former sorts, which contain the three first azures, that you may have them all by themselves in their strict purity, for all your profit and loss de|pends entirely on the art of drawing these different azures, and on your own skill in putting that art into execution.</P>

<HEAD>CXLVI. Observations on the colors of the azures at their coming out of the cement, and the signs which attend them.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The most manifest sign of the first azure coming out, is its apparent coarseness; a character which is owing to the veins of gold which appeared in the original stone, and which give the first ultramarine that sort of look.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second azure will seem finer, but its color will not be so high, nor so fine.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third will increase again in appearance of fineness, but diminish still more in hue, which will be of a much paler blue than any of the two others.&mdash;These observations are always on the supposition that the original stone was a good one, and had gone fairly through all the trials.</P>

<HEAD>CXLVII. The washing and purifying of the azures after they are got out of the cement.</HEAD>
<P>When the different azures are all got out of the ce|ment let them settle and fall down, each at the bottom of their vessels. When their waters appear quite clear and free from them on the top, pour them out gently and carefully, by inclination; then supply them with some of the soft lye, (Art. cxxxviii.) and wash those azures in it with your hands, and each of them dictinct|ly in separate vessels by themselves. Then let them settle to the bottom, and decant out that lye, and repeat again and again the same process, till you are sure they are all well purged from the grease of the cement in which they were. Rinse them afterwards in the same manner in three or four different pure and clear waters, filtered through a hat, and they will be perfectly pu|rified and clean.</P>

<PB N="188" REF="029242_0113_0FDFFE2B179BBF38">
<HEAD>CXLVIII. Another way of purifying the same azures with yolks of eggs.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Take half a dozen of yolks of eggs, from hens fed upon corn, and not suffered to run among the grass, nor to eat any. Pierce the pellicula which covers those yolks with the point of a needle, and pour equally those yolks on the azure powder, as you would do oil on a sallad.</P>
<P N="2">2. Do the same on all your different azures, put se|parately in different dishes. Then incorporate well the azure and the yolks of eggs together with your hands. When done, wash it afterwards with the softest lye, so many times that it shall at last come out as clear as you first put it in; then rinse it three or four times in clear water, which has been filtered several times through a hat.</P>
<P>This method of washing the azures is an excellent one. It may be deemed a true secret to give them a fine lustre and brilliancy. Never forget to let each of your waters be well settled before you change them, otherwise you will lose a great deal of your azures.</P>

<PB N="189" REF="029242_0113_0FDFFE2B179BBF38">
<HEAD>CL. How to run the azures, after having been thus cleansed, washed and purified.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The ultramarine azure, as well as all the others, ought to be run, for fear there should have remained some grease, dirt, or bit of cement among them. There|fore, when they come to the last water you are to give them, after they have been purified by the above men|tioned proceedings, run them through a fine sieve, then through another more open, and through another again more so still. Each time let the waters settle, till you see them quite clear, or take them out by means of a sponge, as before directed in Art. cvii. but do it with such care as not to have your azure get into the sponge with the water, which would be very detrimental to your interest.</P>
<P N="2">2. When you have well cleared all the waters away, let those azures all dry in their own dishes or bowls, and in the shade, not in the sun, and guard well against dust and dirt in working them.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the azures are perfectly dry, gather them each separately, and put them in small white bags made of animals skins with the smoothest side inwards. When the little bag is tied, rub it all manner of ways, to re|fine the azure in it; and the more you shall have done so, the finer color the azure will acquire when you open it, and it comes to the air again.</P>
<P N="4">4. Hardly would you believe perhaps, that after such a deal of trouble as you have had, in conducting this process throughout, from the first purchase of the lapis stone to the point it is now brought, when you see the fruit of your long and tedious labors arrived at last to an happy end, and ready to indemnify you for them by an advantageous sale; hardly, I say, could you be per|suaded that something more can be done to your azures to raise them still in beauty, merit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> price, and that this something is no other than to put them new again into the strong cement, and make them go afresh thro' the same trough, the very same operation, as before di|rected, from that period of the manipulation, step by
<PB N="190" REF="029242_0114_0FDFFE2CAFD773A8">
step, till they are fit again for putting into the little bags mentioned in this very article, and preceding num|ber 3.&mdash;However, it is true, that if you do this, (leaving them for this time but three days only in the cement), and give them over again all the su|cessive washes, purgings, and purifyings, as before, they will be infinitely more refined; and that the more you repeat this manipulation from the cement throughout down to the last purging and washing, the more precious and fine the azure will be.&mdash;It will not be denied, and you must certainly expect, that it will be each time attended with some loss in the weight; but, besides that it raises in the same proportion in its price, which for you is the same, you must know that the purchaser himself finds his own profit and advantage in providing this superior azure, since one ounce only will multiply so far in employing it, that it will go farther than three of the other.&mdash;Therefore, be prudent and patient; but above all, be careful to chuse a good stone, and skilful in composing the cements and pastes.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="151" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>CLI. The method of making the green azure.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. It is not difficult to make the green azure with the American stone, if we are to believe Alexander Trolli|an, who says, that it is enough to reduce that stone into powder on the marble or porphyry, then wash it several times in clean water, and dry it afterwards.&mdash;But it must certainly be far preferable to separate the color from the constituent matter of the stone, and all its earthy particles, which must undoubtedly render it much finer and fitter for painting, as it is more purified of its heterogeneous parts. Therefore, the following process is most adviseable.</P>
<P N="2">2. Reduce the stone into a subtile powder, then put it into brandy or distilled vinegar. Put this to digest on the hot ashes bath, or balneo mariae, till the liquor is perfectly charged with the color of the stone. De|cant it then gently into another vessel, and pour some
<PB N="191" REF="029242_0114_0FDFFE2CAFD773A8">
more brandy or vinegar on its groudn, if you have rea|son to think that there remains some color still in the stone, which has not been carried by the first infusion. When you are sure there is no more left, throw away all the ground, as perfectly useless, and then evaporate, on warm ashes, the vinegar of brandy impregnated with this color; or rather distil it, as by that means you will get your liquor pure again, and may use it another time for the same purpose, instead of washing it a|way.</P>
<P N="3">3. By this process, which se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ms most rational, you will git the green color quite pure at the bottom of the vessel or matrass. Wash and clean it with pure clear water, and, after drying, keep it for use. This is a very fine color in painting, and has this advantage, that it never loses its brightness.</P>

<DIV4 N="152" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>CLII. Another sort of green azure.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. There is another sort of green azure, which is a natural production, to be found in copper mines, and is as it were a dissolution, or subtilization of copper, which flies and sticks on the stones it meets in its way. These sorts of vapors have generally some marks or signs of a mixture of silver, as it may be inferred from the color or stain of those stones which partake of both these metals, for they are green by the copper, and mixed with azure by the silver. And, according as ei|ther of these two metals is more or less predominant in the mine, one of these two colors is likewise stronger in the same proportion. The method of collecting this sort of azure, or evaporation, is as follows.</P>
<P N="2">2. Grind the stone on which it is, and wash it se|veral times over. It needs not be put in the cement af|ter the method observed for the ultramarine azure, be|cause that metallic offlorescence of the green azure, of which we are now speaking, is very easily separated from the stony matter to which it is affixed. For which rea|son it needs only be washed to render it as fine a color

as can possibly be; and, after it has been well washed, dry it in the shade, and then keep it for use.</P>

<HEAD>CLIII. A very fine method for marbling paper.</HEAD>
<P>The paper must first be prepared, that it may more easily retain the colors. This preparation is performed by wetting the paper with a sponge dipped in roch-alum water, then letting it dry.&mdash;When the sheets have been thus prepared, have a pan full of water, and, with a large and long-handled painting-brush, take of one color, and shake it in the water; take of another and do the same, and so on till you have taken of all the colors you intend to have on your paper, and which you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> supposed to have there all ready by you. Each of these colors fall to the bottom of the water; but take, with a similar brush as the first, a mixture of bullock's gall, and of dissolution of soap in water, then shake on the water, and all over its surface, and you will soon see all the colors rising up again and swim|ming on the top of the water each separately as you first put them. Then lay the sheet of paper on it, give it a turn on one side or the other, as you like, and take it up again; wash and set it to dry, then burnish it, and it is done.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>SECRETS relative to the ART of GILDING.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>I. The method of guilding with size, or with oil.</HEAD>
<P>THE gold leaves which are commonly used in gild|ing are of different sizes, as well as of various de|grees of thickness, as there are some the thousand of
<PB N="193" REF="029242_0115_0FDFFE2E4D397F80">
which comes to no more than three pounds altogether, and others which come to three pounds ten shillings, and four pounds, per thousand.</P>
<P>To gild on iron and other metals, the strongest and the purest are preferable. That which is not so pure is commonly employed by carvers in wood, as it comes cheaper to them.</P>
<P>We are indebted to the discovery which has been made a few ages since, of the secret of painting in oil, for the means of gilding in such a manner as to resist the injuries of the weather.&mdash;An art the ancients were not acquainted with, and they could not obtain from their method of applying gold, since they used nothing else but whites of eggs for gilding marble, and such other bodies as do not admit of being committed to the fire. As for the wood, they made a composition which was used with size. But neither size no whites of eggs can re|sist the water. Therefore they could not, with pro|priety, gild any other works than such as were sheltered from the intemperance of the weather, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> their arches, their ceilings, which were all gilt in that manner. The composition they used for gilding on wood was made of a slimy earth, which held the place of the sized white we use now-a-days, and with which gilders make that first coat, called by artists, assiette, or burnish-gold size.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>II. To gild with size, or what is called in burnish-gold.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. You must first begin by preparing your size, which is made as follows.&mdash;Take about a pound of odd bitts of parchment, or leather, such as is prepared for gloves or breeches. Put this a-boiling in a pailful of water, till it is reduced to one half, and your size is done as it ought to be.</P>
<P N="2">2. When you want to use it for wood which is to be gilt, it must be boiling hot, otherwise it would not pe|netrate sufficiently into the wood. If you find it too strong, you may weaken it, by adding water to it. Then with a brush made of boar's bristles, you lay the size in smoothening, if it be a plain work; but, if a
<PB N="194" REF="029242_0116_0FDFFE383B4CC940">
carved one, you must lay it in stumping with the brush; either of which ways is equally termed to size.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the wood is thus prepared with size only, you must make another preparation, called an infusion of white, in the following manner. Take a certain quantity of size boiling hot, as much as you think will be sufficient for your work. Dilute a discretionable quantity of pulverised whitening in it, and let it in|fuse some time. When it seems well dissolved, strain it through a cloth to make it finer; then, with a brush, as above, give seven or eight different coats of it in stump|ing on your work, and two more coats in smoothening, if it be on carved work, but if on a plain one, you must give a dozen of coats at least; for the white is the nourishment of gold, and serves to preserve it a great while.&mdash;You must be very careful not to give coat upon coat, unless the last be dry; otherwise the work might scale. You must even have a great care that each coat should be laid on as perfectly equal as possible, both in the strength of the size, and thickness of the white, to avoid the same inconveniency.</P>
<P N="4">4. When you have given the requisite number of coats, where in stumping, or in smoothening, you must let the work dry thoroughly before you polish it. As soon therefore as it is perfectly dry, you must have a coarse rough cloth, quite new, and as closely weaved as possible, with little deal sticks, cut square, angular, or pecked, according as the nature and carving of the work require; and, thrusting one of these sticks into the cloth, you rub and smoothen the white. Then taking a brush made of boar's bristles, which has been already used, because it is softer, dip it into some clean water, and wet the work in proportion as you go on in polishing, with your little sticks wrapped up in cloth. This precaution completes the smoothening of the work by levelling the small bumps and imperceptible undu|lations, you may have made either in giving the white, or in polishing it. For the smoother the work is made, the more easy to be burnished the gold will be, after having been applied. The wetting and brushing thus
<PB N="195" REF="029242_0116_0FDFFE383B4CC940">
your work, in proportion as you polish it, with a brush a little worn, has again that other object of cleansing it of the mud you occasion in so doing; therefore spare not to be purge your brush of all the filth it gathers about the point of its hair, by washing and squeezing it again as soon as you see them grow thick in the least with that dirt.</P>
<P N="5">5. When the white is once more dried, rub it with shavegrass, or rushes, in order to level still better all the grains and inequalities which may be on it. Do not how|ever rub it too much with the shavegrass, because you may thereby fall from one error into another, and make your white what is called greasy or smeary, which would pre|vent it afterwards from uniting with the burnish gold size, which is to precede the laying on of the gold.</P>
<P N="6">6. Now, as it is difficult that after ten or a dozen of coats of white, the carving should not be choaked up, they who are fond of finishing their work highly, take a certain iron instrument, made on purpose, and curved by one end, (called by the French, a fer-a-retirer); with this raffling-crook they go over all the turns, and open all the places which want it, to restore them to their former sharpness. Or else, you take what is called a fermoir, or a gouge, or a cizel, and give to the orna|ments the same form which the carver observed when he first cut them, turning agreeably the sides of leaves ac|cording to nature; then bretelling with another instru|ment, called the veining-crook, (in French fermoir-a|nezrond), all the ornaments, you thereby render the work much neater, and more delicate than the carver had first made it. That you may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the white more neat, ob|serve only to wet it a little with a brush.</P>
<P N="7">7. When works are not of great consequence, you may easily save yourself all that trouble; principally if the carving is pretty neatly finished, by giving two or three coats only of white very clear. But, as it is very true the white is the principal and only support of gold, this operation is never so perfect, nor stands so long; and the carving seems a great deal more rough than when it has received ten or twelve coats of white, and been after|wards
<PB N="196" REF="029242_0117_0FDFFE3A2155B8D0">
re-cut, carved, veined, and repaired over again, as I said before.</P>
<P N="8">8. After every thing has been performed about the white, which could be required to completely finish that preparatory part, you must dilute some yellow ochre, and grind it with sized water, weaker by half than that which you used for the whitening. And, having made it a little fluid and warm, you lay one coat of it over all the work, principally in such deep places of the carving as you cannot come at to lay the gold leaf, that this color may supply its want.</P>
<P N="9">9. When the yellow is dry, you must lay over it (in all the raised places, but not in the bottom grounds) three different coats of another sort of composition, called in French assiette, and here, burnish-gold size, made and prepared in the following manner&mdash;Bolar|menian, about the bigness of a nut, and grinded by itself; bloodstone, or red chalk, the bulk of a horse bean, and black lead pulverised as big as a pea, grinded both together; and at last one drop or two of tallow, which you grind afterwards with all the other drugs and water, taking them little at a time, to grind and incorporate them the better.&mdash;Put this composition in a cup, and pour over it some of your afore-mentioned size, boiling hot, and strained through a cloth. Stir and mix all well, while you pour that size, that the whole may be well diluted. The size you make use of in this case must, to be right, be of the consistence of the jelly you eat, and no more, when cold.&mdash;There are those who mix again besides, with this composi|tion, a little soap, or olive oil, with a little of cal|cined lamp-black. Others add burnt bread, bistre, antimony, tin-glass, butter, fugarcandy, &amp;c. every one according to his own way. All these sorts of grease serve to facilitate the burnishing of the gold, and help to give it more brightness. Be, however, this composi|tion made how it will, observe to keep it warm over hot ashes in a chafing-dish, whenever and while you use it. The brush you lay it on with ought to be soft,
<PB N="197" REF="029242_0117_0FDFFE3A2155B8D0">
and the first coat you lay pretty thin; but, as for the two others, they must be so thick that the stuff should run with difficulty from the brush. Each coat must be well dried before giving the next. And, when the last is perfectly dry, take a stiffer brush with which you dry|rub the work all over, to smoothen all the grains and little risings of the gold size, and thereby facilitate the burnishing of the gold.</P>
<P N="10">10. The gilding is now performed as follows. Have first a pipkin very clean, in which you put some very clean and filtered water, and a few wetting pencils, which ought to be made in the form of those ermine tails which hang in the ermine skins.&mdash;Get next a cushion, which is to be made with a light and flat square board covered with calf leather, fixed all round with nails, and stuffed underneath with cotton. Let this cushion be also surrounded by the back part, and two thirds of each of the two sides, with a band of parchment of five or six inches high, to prevent the air, which is always fluctuating about you, and still more so if any body should happen to pass and repass in the place where you sit, from blowing the gold leaf which is laid upon it.</P>
<P N="11">11. To apply the gold, you proceed thus. Hold your cushion in your left hand along with the gilding pencils, which are to be of different sizes. On this cushion put what quantity of gold leaves you think proper. With the gilding knife spread these leaves very smooth, in doing of which you will assist yourself very much if you breathe over them while you pass the knife under. Then cut it in as many parts and sizes as you want, or, if there be occasion for it whole, take it with your tip, and lay it,&mdash;A tip (in French, palette), is an instrument made with the point of a squirrel's tail placed upon a round stick flattened, and about half an inch wide by one end, with a slit, to set and spread the better the squirrel's tail.&mdash;This tip therefore you pass along your cheek, and with it take off the gold leaf, or what part of it you have divided, and thus lay it on the work.
<PB N="198" REF="029242_0118_0FDFFE3BC3300658">
Previously, however, to this, you must have passed on the place one of your pencils immediately before the laying of the gold, otherwise the gold would be in|cessantly slitting and cracking.&mdash;As soon as the gold leaf is laid on the work, take your water pencil quite wet, and passing it above it on the work, let the water run from it under the leaf just applied; this will immedi|ately make it spread and ketch. But if it should pass over the gold leaf, it would immediately spot and spoil it; and as it is impossible to lay gold on gold, especially when wet, you would not be able to repair it unless you take the gold leaf entirely off, and put another in the stead. On the contrary, by the water slipping under the gold leaf just laid, you will find that this spreads infinitely more easy, and almost of itself; it sticks faster on the gold size, never scratches, is more easily dusted for burnishing, or matting with size; in short the work looks infinitely better in every respect.&mdash;As it is impos|sible with all possible care one can take, but there may happen some little accident now and then, principally in carved works, you must, in such a case, cut some small bits of gold, which, with a pencil, you take and put on the defective places when you look your work over; and this is called faulting the work, in French ramender.</P>
<P N="12">12. When the work is perfectly dry, burnish it where you think proper, in order to detach certain parts from the other, to make them set off and shew to better ad|vantage. To that effect you use an instrument called a burnisher, made either of a real Wolf's tooth, or rather, as they now use it, an agate, made in the same form. and finely polished, or else a pebble called blood stone.&mdash;Before burnishing, you must, with the crooked point of your burnisher, push down all the parts of gold in the hollow parts which you forgot to do with the pencil, then dust it with a large one. When the work is burnish|ed where you want it to be so, you matt and repass, with a very soft pencil and burnish gold size, what has not been burnished; or, you may again put some vermilion,
<PB N="199" REF="029242_0118_0FDFFE3BC3300658">
to raise the gold, and make it look brighter; which is called, in term of art, repassing.</P>
<P N="13">13. There is again another repassing you must not forget, which is to lay, in all the hollow places of a carved work, a coat of a composition of vermilion, as I am going to prescribe, and which will give an incom|parable fire to the gold, and make it look as gold|smith's work. This composition is such.&mdash;Grind to|gether, on marble, some vermilion, gamboge, and red brown, which you mix with a little Venetian turpentine, and oil of turpentine. There are who make it other|wise, and use only fine lake, and others, dragon's blood; but the first receipt is the best.&mdash;If, after having bur|nished, matted, and repassed your work, you find again some defective places, you may mend them with gold in shell, which, as you know, is diluted with a little gum arabic, and applied with a pencil. This sort of faulting, which is no small addition to the beauty and richness of the work, the French call buckling with gold in shell.</P>

<HEAD>II. To gild without gold.</HEAD>
<P>Put in a crucible one ounce of ammoniac salt, and half that quantity of common mercury. Cover and lute well the crucible for fear the mercury should exhale. Give this a small fire for the space of half an hour. Increase the fire afterwards till the crucible is quite red hot. Then throw the composition into a pan of cold water. As soon as this matter is cold, it will be as hard as a stone. Break and grind it, and dissolve it in gum water. Wherever you lay a coat of this, it will look like gilt.</P>

<P N="1">1. Take first the finest gold, forge it weakish, then cut it in bits and neal it, on an iron plate, or in a cruci|ble.</P>
<P N="2">2. Have next a glass matrass, put your gold in, and to every drachm of gold, put half a pound of ammoniac salt, and two ounces of good aquafortis. Cover the matrass with a sheet of paper, turned conically by one of its corners upon one of the long sides, so as to form

a sort of funnel or grenadier's cap figure, with the smallest orifice, to give a free passage to the fumes of the aquafortis. Set this matrass on a very slow fire, that the gold may have time to dissolve gently and gra|dually, and shake often the matrass to help the dissolu|tion. Be very careful not to make the fire to strong; but on the contrary, let it be very mild, for the gold would infallibly sublime and waste itself all into va|pours.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the gold is entirely dissolved, pour this li|quor into a glass, or china bowl; wet some old coarse linen rags on them, which you set to drain on small sticks on another bowl, doing the same with what drains from them till you have used all your liquor; then dry them before a gentle fire.</P>
<P N="4">4. When dry, lay them on a marble stone, and set them on fire. And as soon as they are consumed, grind them into a fine powder, which you put afterwards in|to a crucible on a little fire. When this powder is lighted like sparkles of fire, put it on the marble again, and stir it with an iron rod till you see no more fire.

When done, you have no more to do but to carry up these pewter leaves, rolled, in a basket; and, having burnished the place on which they are to be ap|plied with the above composition, lay the gilt pewter leaves on it, and they will stand fast enough.</P>

<P N="2">2. Next boil this composition till it comes very thick; then take it off from the fire and mould it in moulds shaped in forms of coral. Or else cast it again in what other sorts of moulds you like, to make figures of it, and other sorts of work, which will produce a fine effect.</P>
<P>Observation. This secret has been worth immense sums of money to him who found it out. The Turks, to whom these sorts of works were carried, paid them magnificently. But this branch of trade was soon put

When done, list it up, and set it in the air, where it will come again as hard as metal, and will serve you to seal the same letter, after having opened it, with its own coat of arms or cypher, &amp;c. as the original seal itself, without any probability of discovering it, should even the real one be laid on it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>SECRETS relative to the ART of CASTING in MOULDS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>I. To cast a figure in bronze.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. To cast a figure, or any other piece in bronze, you must, first, make a pattern with a proper clay. That clay ought to be mixed with sand, to prevent its crack|ing, when it comes to dry.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the pattern is completed and the sculptor is pleased with his work, you mould it with plaister while it is still damp, because in drying, the parts of the pat|tern shrink, and lose their fulness. To that effect you begin by the bottom part of the figure, which you cover with several pieces, and by rows; as for example, let us suppose the first row from the feet to the knees; the second from the knees to the beginning of the belly; the third from the beginning of the belly up to the pit of the stomach, from thence to the shoulders, on which you lay the last row, which is to contain the head.&mdash;Observe, however, that those divisions of rows admit of no particular rule, and ought to be intirely deter|mined by, and adapted to the size of the figure. For when the pieces are made too considerable, the plaister works too much, and fatigues itself, which is detrimen|tal
<PB N="234" REF="029242_0136_0FDFFE81CBF7E378">
to its taking a true and precise impression of all the turns and shapes of the figure. So that at any rate, it is always preferable to make the pieces of the mould smal|ler than larger.</P>
<P N="3">3. You must observe, that if the figure you are mould|ing have got any draperies, or other sorts of ornaments about it, which require a good deal of trouble and nicety, you cannot help making a great many small parts and subdivisions in your mould, in order to enable you to strip them off the figure afterwards with more facility. In which circumstance, when all these small parts are made, and garnished with little rings to assist in pulling them off more easily, you cover them all over with larger pieces, which containing several of the lit|tle ones, are called cases, and in French chapes.</P>
<P N="4">4. When the mould is thus made and completed, you let it rest till it is perfectly dry. Then, before using it, they who are curious, in their work, do not content themselves with imbibing it inwardly with oil, but they even make it drink as much wax as it can soak, by warming those separate pieces, and putting wax in them to melt.&mdash;The motive, in doing this, is to render the wax-work, which is to be cast in it finer and more per|fect. For if you imbibe the mould with oil only, the wax figure cast in such a mould always comes out a little rough and like flour, because the wax draws al|ways the superfice of the plaister, and in reverse, the plaister draws also the superfice of the wax, which pro|duces a great defect in the figure, and is a great obstacle to its coming out from the mould with that neatness it otherwise would.</P>
<P N="5">5. The mould being therefore thus imbibed with wax, if you want it for a bronze figure, you assemble all the small parts of it each in their cases, and with a brush give them a coat of oil. Then, with another brush, give them another coat also of wax, prepared as follows.&mdash;Six pounds of wax, half a pound of hog's lard, and one pound of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">gundy pitch.&mdash;This pre|paration of the wax, however, must be regulated accord|ing to the country and the season. For in the heat of
<PB N="235" REF="029242_0136_0FDFFE81CBF7E378">
summer, or hot climes, such as Spain, Italy, and France; wax may be used alone, as it keeps naturally soft, and the other drugs above mentioned, are added to it only to render it more tractable. Of this wax, therefore, whether prepared or natural, you lay another coat, as we said, in the hollow of the mould, to the thickness of a sixpenny piece. Then, with wax made in flat cakes, of the thickness of a quarter of an inch, more or less, according to that you are willing to give your metal, you fill all the hollow parts of the mould in pressing hard this sort of wax in them with your fin|gers. When thus filled, you have an iron grate, larger by three or four inches every way than the plinth or basis of the figure. On the middle of that grate you erect one or more iron bars, continued agreeable to the latitude and situation of the figure, and bored, from space to space, with holes to pass other iron rods of the size and length necessary to support the core (in French ame or noyau) of what you want to cast.</P>
<P N="6">6. Formerly they used to make their cores with pot|ter's clay mixed with hair and horse-dung well beaten together. With this compost, they formed a figure like the pattern; and, when they had well supported it with iron bars, length and cross-ways, according to its position and attitude, they scraped it, that is to say, they diminished, and took off from its bigness as much as they wanted to give to their metal. When that core was dry, they took the wax with which they had filled the hollow parts of their mould, and covered it with them.&mdash;This method is even practised now by some founders especially for great bronze figures, because earth resists better the power of that red-hot melted me|tal, than plaister can; and this they reserve only for small figures, and those which are cast in gold or silver. However, when plaister is well beaten and mixed with brick-dust also well beaten and sifted fine, it stands pret|ty well too. We shall therefore proceed on the method of casting on plaister cores.</P>
<P N="7">7. You take then the first, or bottom rows of the mould, filled by the last wax in cakes, as mentioned be|fore,
<PB N="236" REF="029242_0137_0FDFFE84DA40B018">
and assemble them on the iron grate round the principal iron bar, which is to support the core when made. When they are joined together, you give them a tye round very hard with cords, left they should vary from their position when you form the core.</P>
<P N="8">8. To form this, as soon as the first set which com|pletes the bottom row of the separate pieces of the mould is fixed, you pour plaister, diluted very clear, and mixed, as we said, with brick-dust, with which you fill up that bottom part of the hollow. Then, on this first bottom row of the mould, you place the second in the same manner as the first; then fill it likewise with your prepared plaister. Thus you continue to erect your mould from row to row, till you come to the last, and fill it as you go, with plaister, which is called forming the core. If the figure require it, you pass across the core some iron rods through the holes perforated for that purpose in the perpendicular bars, in order to sup|port the core the better, and give it more strength and power to resist the effort of the metal when it comes in fusion upon it.</P>
<P N="9">9. When all the pieces of the mould have been thus erected one upon another, and filled with plaister, you must stop a certain time to let it take a consistence, then proceed to take off the cases and all the similar parts of the mould contained in each of them, row by row, and one by one, in the same manner as you proceed to erect them, with this difference, that in erecting them you begin at the bottom, and that in taking them off, you begin at the top; which when done, leaves the figure to appear all in wax, covering the core, which is con|tained in the inside of it.</P>
<P N="10">10. You are then to proceed to the repairing of the figure, and finish it after the original. The sculptor, in that case, has even an opportunity of perfecting much some of the parts, in adding or taking off according as he thinks proper, to give more grace and expression to certain strokes, muscles, or features only: as for the disposition of the limbs, and their attitude, he can no longer mend or alter them.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="237" REF="029242_0137_0FDFFE84DA40B018">
11. The figure thus well prepared, you are to place what is called the pouring and the vent holes. The pouring holes are wax pipes of the bigness of an inch diameter for such figures as are of a natural size; for they are to be proportioned not only to the size of the figure, but even to that of the parts of that figure whereon they are placed. The vent holes are wax pipes likewise, but of a much letter size. Those pipes are cast in plaister moulds of what length you please, then cut to that of four or five inches, or thereabouts. They are cast hollow, to the intent of rendering them lighter, otherwise they might as well be cast solid. Those which serve for pouring, are placed in a straight perpendi|cular line, one above another, at six inches asunder, and sometimes nearer, when there are draperies, and much matter is used.</P>
<P N="12">12. When the various pipes are placed and soldered against the figure, with wax, so that the end which is free should be upwards, and as much perpendicular to the figure as possible, you place another pipe of the same size quite perpendicular, which is to be fixed against eve|ry one of the ends of the others. All these pipes, both large and small, serve for the pouring of the matter, and casting of the figure. You are to place three or four of them generally round the figure, which is deter|mined by its size, bulk, and disposition.</P>
<P N="13">13. But at the same time you are placing the pour|ing-holes, you must not neglect placing also those which are to serve for the vent. These <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are to be placed in the same line as and with the others, at the distance of four inches only from them, and fixed likewise by one end to the figure, and by the other to another long and perpendicular pipe, like those for pouring. Now, as it is necessary that all the wax, when you come to melt it, should, as we shall mention in its place, come out entirely from the mould, you must not fail to place those sorts of vent pipes on all the rising and dis|tant parts from the mean bulk of the figure, such as the arms, fingers, draperies, &amp;c. &amp;c. from which the wax must be got out with facility, either by means of par|ticular
<PB N="238" REF="029242_0138_0FDFFDFBEC0F3490">
vent-holes, so formed as to descend to the bot|tom of the figure, or by means of those large ones pla|ced perpendicularly along side of it.&mdash;Observe, always, to make the pouring holes which come to the face and hands the smallest of any, that they may not affect too much the features and likeness, if any be intended, of those parts; and that you may the more easily repair those places with the chisel, when they are fi|nished.</P>
<P N="14">14. After these various pipes have been thus care|fully fixed all about the figure, you must so place them that two of the main perpendicular ones should join to|gether at five or six inches higher, and above the upper part of it, and be terminated by a wax cup of four inches deep, and as much diameter, under, and at the bottom part of which you solder them. This cup serves as a funnel to receive the metal, and introduces it into the pouring holes, by means of its communication with them, to convey it afterwards into all the parts of the figure at once, and form it. Therefore, if there be four perpendicular ascending pipes, you make too such cups, to communicate the metal to these pipes.</P>
<P N="15">15. As for the vent-holes, you let them free above the top of the figure, and higher than the pouring ones, be|cause they want no cups.</P>
<P N="16">16. When the wax figure is thus completely repaired and garnished, with all its pouring and vent holes, you prepare a composition of putty, and crucibles powder, well grinded, and sifted very fine, which you dilute clear in a pan, like a color for painting. With a brush take this composition, and cover all the figure, as well as the vent and pouring pipes. This operation you re|peat several times, observing carefully to fill up all the cracks and crevices which may happen in drying. When the wax is thus perfectly covered every where, you put with the same brush, another composition thicker than the first, and of a stronger sort.</P>
<P N="17">17. This composition is made of the same materials as the other, but with this addition, that you mix
<PB N="239" REF="029242_0138_0FDFFDFBEC0F3490">
some free earth along with it, and horse-dung, quite clear from any straw. After having given six or seven coats of this, you give another coat again, much thicker still, of a stuff composed of nothing but free earth and horse-dung, and this being dry, you give half a dozen more of the same, allowing time between each to dry. At last, you put with your hand, and no more with the brush, two other coats of this same last composi|tion, of free earth and horse-dung, mixed in form of mortar, observing always that one should be perfectly dry, before laying on the other; and that there should be no part of the figure, whether naked or draperies, but what is equally covered with every one of the diffe|rent coats we have mentioned.</P>
<P N="18">18. Next to this, you must have flat iron bars turned and bent according to the disposition of the figure, which being fixed by means of hooks at the sides of the grate on which it stands, rise up as high as the pipes, and joining close to the mould, unite at top by means of a circle of iron which runs through all the hooks, by which these bars are terminated. Then you surround again the figure with other iron bars, made in form of hoops, to prevent the others which go from top to bot|tom, and to which they are fixed by means of wires, from giving way; and, between every one of these bars, both perpendicular and horizontal, there must be no more than seven or eight inches distance al|lowed.</P>
<P N="19">19. When all these bars are well fixed together and enabled thereby to support and contain the mould, you take a compost of free earth, horse-dung and hair mixed together, in consistence of mortar, and with this you co|ver the mould and the bars all over, without attending any more to the shape of the figure, so that there appears no more but a shapeless lump of clay, which ought to be of about four or five inches thick.</P>
<P N="20">20. When the mould is thus completed, you are to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a square pit sufficiently deep for the top of the mould to be somewhat lower than the superfice of the ground where the pit is dug, and sufficiently wide
<PB N="240" REF="029242_0139_0FDFFE88336D3110">
also to allow a room of a foot and a half, free all round the mould, when descended into it.&mdash;At the bottom of that pit, you construct a furnace, on the top of which there is to be a strong iron grate supported by the arches and wall of the furnace, which is to be made of stone or bricks, as well as the four sides of the pit from top to bottom.</P>
<P N="21">21. After the grate is placed on the furnace, you de|scend the mould on it by means of engines. Then, un|der the pipes which are to serve for pouring, as well as vent, you place pans to receive the wax which is to run off. This done, you light a middling fire to heat the figure, and all the place where it stands, with so moderate a heat, that the wax may melt without boil|ing, and come entirely out from the mould, without there remaining any part of it; which would not be the case if the heat be so great as to make it boil, for then it would stick to the mould, and cause defects in the figure, when you come to run the metal.&mdash;When, therefore, you judge that all the wax is out, which you may know by weighing that you employed, and weigh|ing it again after it is in the pans, you take these off, and stop the pipes, through which it came out, with clay. Then fill all the empty parts of the pit round the fi|gure with bricks, which you throw in gently, but without order: and, when it is come up to the top, made a good brisk fire in the furnace. As the flame is interrupted by these bricks, it cannot ascend with violence, nor hurt the mould, and they only commu|nicate their heat in going through all those bricks, which become so hot, that they and the mould are at a last both red-hot.</P>
<P N="22">22. Twenty-four hoursafter the fire has been lighted, when you see that the bricks and the mould are equally red hot from top to bottom, you let the fire go out, and the mould cool, by taking all the bricks off. When there is no more any heat at all, you throw some earth in the pit, to fill the place which had been occupied with the bricks; and, in proportion as you throw it
<PB N="241" REF="029242_0139_0FDFFE88336D3110">
in you tread it with your feet, and press it against the mould.</P>
<P N="23">23. In order to melt this metal, you construct, just by the pit where the mould is, a furnace, the lower part of which ought to be higher by two or three inches than the top of the said pit, in order to obtain a sufficient declivity from it to the pit for the running of the me|tal. Its construction must be after the form of an oven, with good bricks and free earth, and supported by good and strong iron hoops. There is a border raised all round, so as to make it capable to contain all the metal which is intended to be melted in it. On the side which looks towards the pit, there is an opening, which is stopped during the melting of the metal, and from that opening comes an earthen funnel practised, which goes to a bason of good free earth placed over the mould, and the middle of which corresponds and communicates to those cups we have mentioned before, [No. 14.] This bason is called by the workmen escheno. And in order to prevent the metal from running into these cups before the whole which is in the furnace is run into the escheno, there are men on purpose who hold a long iron rod ter|minated by one end in the form of these cups, and stop them.</P>
<P N="24">24. When the metal is melted, you unstop the open|ing of the furnace in which it is contained; this runs into the escheno, and as soon as it is arrived, the men take off the rod with which they stopped the cups, and the mould being instantly filled all over, the figure is formed in one moment.</P>
<P N="25">25. After the mould is thus filled with the metal, you let it stay in that situation for three or four days, then, at leisure, you take off the earth which had been thrown all round it, which helps the mould to become entirely cold. As soon as you are sure there is no more heat, you break the mould, and the metal figure appears sur|rounded with rods of the same metal, starting out from it, occasioned by the vent and pouring-holes, or pipes, through which the metal was introduced, and which re|mained
<PB N="242" REF="029242_0140_0FDFFE92A37BE878">
filled with it. These you must saw off, in order to unburden the figure of so much, and get it out of the pit more easily. Then you clean and scower with water and grinding stone in powder, and pieces of deal or other sort of soft wood, and you search in all the hollow pla|ces of the draperies and other parts.</P>
<P N="26">26. When the figures are small, they are generally washed with aquafortis; and, when it has operated, you may wash them again with common water. When they are thus well cleansed, you repair, finish, and fault those which require to be treated more highly than others; for the large ones are seldom searched so mi|nutely.</P>
<P N="27">27. After they have been as much finished as they are intended to be, you may give them, if you like, a co|lour, as some do, with oil and blood-stone. Or, as some others practise it, you may make them turn green by means of vinegar. But without all that trouble, the bronze will in time take a natural varnish of itself, and become of a blackish hue.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>II. How to gild such sorts of figures.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. They may be gilt two different ways; either with gold in shells, or with gold in leaves. The first method is the handsomest, and at the same time the most lasting, it being always used for small sized works. To apply it, you make a mixture of one part of the best gold, and seven of mercury, which founders call silver in that sort of process. When these are incorporated together, you then heat the figure, and rub it with the compo|sition, which whitens it, and heating it again over the fire the mercury exhales, and the figure remains gilt.</P>
<P N="2">2. As for the other method it is only for large sized works, and them on which one is not willing to make a great expence; you scrape the figure with small files, and other proper tools, to make it quick and clean, then you heat and lay on a gold leaf, repeating this four times.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="method">
<PB N="243" REF="029242_0140_0FDFFE92A37BE878">
<HEAD>III. Of the choice and composition of metals.</HEAD>
<P>Any metal whatever may be used for the casting of figures, though the general composition runs as fol|lows.</P>
<P N="1">1. For the fine bronze figures, the alloy is half brass, half copper. The Egyptians who are said to be the in|ventors of that art, used to employ two thirds of brass against one of copper.</P>
<P N="2">2. Brass is made with copper and calamine. One hun|dred weight of calamine renders one hundred per cent. Ca|lamine is a stone from which a yellow dye is drawn. It is to be found in France and at Liege.</P>
<P N="3">3. Good copper ought to be beaten, not molten, when intended for statues. You must guard also against using putty, when in alloy with lead.</P>
<P N="4">4. Copper may be forged either hot or cold. But brass breaks when cold, and suffers the hammer only when hot.</P>
<P N="5">5. There is a sort of metallic stone called zinc, which comes from Egypt: it renders the copper of a much finer yellow than the calamine; but, as it is both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and scarcer, they are not so ready to use it.</P>
<P N="6">6. As for the composition for making of bells, it is twenty pounds weight pewter for each hundred of cop|per. And the artillery pieces take but ten pounds only of pewter to one hundred of the other. This last com|position is not good for the casting of figures, as it is both too hard and too brittle.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD>SECRETS relative to the making of curious and useful sorts of INK.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>I. A good shining Ink.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. PUT four quarts of warm water in a glazed pip|kin. Add eight ounces of turpentine oil, and one pound of gal-nuts bruised in a mortar. Let the whole infuse thus for a week, then boil it gently till, with a pen, you may draw a stroke yellow and shiny with it. Strain it through a strong cloth. Set it on a blasting fire, and, as soon as it boils, add seven ounces of green vitriol to it, keep stirring it with a stick till it is perfectly dissolved. Let this rest for two days with|out disturbing it. There will be a skim on the top, which must be thrown off. Decant next the clearest part into another vessel, which you set on a gentle fire to evaporate about two fingers of the liquor, then let it rest four or five days, and it will be fit for use.</P>
<P N="2">2. Rain water, or that in which wallnuts have been infused, are both very good for making of ink.</P>
<P N="3">3. With white wine, or old beer, you may likewise make very good shining ink.</P>
<P N="4">4. A carp's gall is very proper to mix among it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>II. To write on grease, and make the ink run on it.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Cut a bullock's gall open into a pan, and put a handful of salt and about a quarter of a pint of vinegar
<PB N="245" REF="029242_0141_0FDFFE9572345B20">
to it, which you stir and mix well. Thus you may keep the gall, for twelve months without its corrupting.</P>
<P N="2">2. When you are writing, and you find your paper or parchment greasy, put a drop of that gall among your ink in the ink-horn, and you will find no more difficulty to make your pen mark.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>III. An ink-stone, with which ink-stands may be made, and with which you may write without ink.</HEAD>
<P>Take gum arabic, fourteen ounces; lamp-black, thir|teen; and burnt willow wood coals, three. Pound the gum into an impalpable powder, and dissolve it into a pint of common water. This done knead your above|mentioned powders with part of this gum water, so as to make a paste or dough of them, as it were, for bread. With this dough form ink-stands of the shape and form you like best, and in the ink-stands, while the composition is still soft, you may stamp a few small holes.</P>
<P N="2">2. This done, dry these stands in an ardent furnace for four hours, or in the shade a sufficient time. When dry, brush them over with your afore-mentioned gum water; till they appear as black and shiny as jet, and as hard as marble.</P>
<P N="4">4. When you want to use them, put a few drops of water in one of the holes, and put a pen to soak in it at the same time. If the water be just put in, the ink will not be quite so black, but if it had remained a little while, it will be as black as the blackest of any inks.</P>

Heat this only to whiteness, then put it in a small cask, and set it in the sun, or over a baker's oven, or any other warm place.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now and then add new wine in your cask after having previously heated it as before, and let that quanti|ty be no more than two or three quarts at a time, till the cask is quite full.&mdash;If you add a few quarts of real vinegar it will be the stronger.&mdash;Before casking the wine, you must let it rest in the pan in which it has boiled for two or three days.&mdash;A glazed earthen pan is therefore preferable to a copper one for boiling the wine in; for during the three days infusion, the cop|per might communicate a dangerous quality of verdigrise to the vinegar.&mdash;When you put some vinegar, as before mentioned, to meliorate this composition, instead of wine, you must take care to heat it likewise over the fire, but not so much as the wine.&mdash;Let the cask be well rinsed and perfectly clean, before putting the vinegar in.</P>
<P N="3">3. The wild black-berries which grow among hedges are also very good to make vinegar, but they must be used while red, before they are ripe; then put them in the wine and heat this to whiteness, and proceed in the same manner as you do with pyrethra, ginger, and long pepper.&mdash;The dose of black-berries is not deter|mined; you may take any discretionable quantity of them, and the vinegar which results from these is very good.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>I. To make as good wine as Spanish wine.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. TAKE one hundred pounds weight of dry rai|sins, from which pick off the stems, and open the fruit with a knife. Put these in a large wooden tub, very clean. Boil fifteen gallons of rain-water, purified by straining through the filtering paper. Pour it over the raisins, and cover it, to preserve the heat of the water. Twenty-four hours after take off the raisins which will be swelled, and pound them in a large marble mortar, then put them again in the tub. Heat fifteen gallons more of water, which pour over the other with the raisins, and throw in twenty-five pounds of coarse sugar. Stir all well, and cover the tub over with two blankets. Three days after, by a cock placed at the bottom of the tub, draw out all the liquor, and cask it, adding six quarts of brandy to it. Press the ground with an apothecary's press, and put the juice in the cask with two pounds of white tartar pounded into a subtile powder, in order to promote the fermentation, and five or six ounces of polychrest salt, and a knot of garden eress-seed, of about sixteen or eighteen ounces weight, and another knot of seven pugils of elder flowers. These knots are to be suspended by a thread in the cask.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the wine looks too yellow, you must strain it through a jelly-bag, in which you shall put one pound of
<PB N="281" REF="029242_0159_0FDFFECF446722E0">
sweet almonds pounded with milk. The older the wine, so much the better it is.</P>
<P N="3">3. To make it red, dissolve some cochineal pounded in a certain quantity of brandy, along with a little alum powder, in order to draw the better the dye of the co|chineal, which put to digest on a sand-bath. Till the brandy has assumed a proper degree of color, give it to your wine in a sufficient degree.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is preferable to clarify the sugar well, and put it in the cask instead of the tub.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>II. Another way to imitate Spanish wine.</HEAD>
<P>Take six quarts of white wine; Narbonne honey, one pound; Spanish raisins as much; coriander bruis|ed, one drachm; coarse sugar, one pound. Put all in a kettle on a slow fire, and leave it there, well covered, for three hours. Strain this through a jelly-bag, then bottle and stop it well. Eight or ten days after it is sit for drinking.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>III. To make the Rossolis.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Boil first some water, and let it cool till it is no more than lukewarm. Take next all the sorts of fragrant flowers the season can afford, and well picked, keeping none but the petals of each flower. Infuse these, each saparately, in some of that lukewarm water, to extract their odorous smell, or fragrancy. Then take them off and drain them.&mdash;Pour all these different waters in one pitcher; and to every three quarts of this mixture put a quart or three pints of spirit of wine, three pounds of clarified sugar, one quarter of a pint of essential oil of anise-seed, and an equal quantity of essential oil of cinnamon.</P>
<P N="2">2. Should your Rossolis prove too sweet and slimy in the mouth, add half a pint, or more of spirit of wine.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="282" REF="029242_0160_0FDFFED0E16E8860">
3. If you think the essential oil of anise-seed should whiten too much the Rossolis, mix it with the spirit of wine, before putting it in the mixed waters.</P>
<P N="4">4. If you want to increase the fragrancy, add a few spoonsful of essential oils of different flowers, with one pugil or two of musk, prepared amber, and lump sugar pulverised. Then strain the Rossolis through a jelly-bag to clarify it, bottle and stop it well. Thus it may keep for ten years, and upwards.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>IV. To make a Rossolis which may serve as a founda|tion to other liquors.</HEAD>
<P>Put three quarts of brandy, and one of water, in a glazed earthen pot. Place this pot on a charcoal fire, adding a crust of bread and one ounce of anise-seed, and cover it till it boils. Then uncover it, and let it boil five minutes, and put in one pound of sugar, or more if you chuse. Now beat the white of an egg with a little of your liquor, take the pot off from the fire, and throw in the white of an egg. Let this rest thus for three days.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>V. To make Ambrosy.</HEAD>
<P>In the above prescribed Rossolis water add three or four grains of paradise; as much cochineal pulverised; one clove; a little cinnamon and mace; six grains of coriander, and the quarter part of a lemon.</P>

<PB N="283" REF="029242_0160_0FDFFED0E16E8860">
<HEAD>VII. A common Rossolis.</HEAD>
<P>Instead of one pound of sugar, put only half-a-pound, and as much of honey.&mdash;To musk it, put about fifteen grains of musk, and as much of ambergrise in powder, and pounded with sugar, and mix it in the liquor.</P>

Let it dry for twenty-four hours, then distil the liquor by the heat of a balneum mariae, and keep it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Make next a syrup, with brandy of spirit of wine, which burn over lump sugar pulverised in an earthen dish or pan, stirring always with a spoon, till the flame has subsided. Then mix one drachm of ambergrise with an equal quantity of sugar; and, having pulverised the whole, put it in a small matrass; pour over it one ounce of spirit of wine, and put all to digest for twenty|four hours in a balneum mariae. There will then result a dissolution which will congeal again in the cold.</P>
<P N="3">3. To form your Rossolis, mix with your first compo|sition, the above-mentioned syrup of brandy, and the es|sence of amber,&mdash;If you want the Rossolis to be strong|er, add some spirit of wine to it, till it is as you desire to have it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>IX. Another way.</HEAD>
<P>Boil your syrup to consistence after the common me|thod. When done, add as much spirit of wine as you think proper, as well as of the above-mentioned essence of amber, or any other sort you please to prefer; and you will have as good Rossolis as that which comes from Turin.</P>

When all this is done have an alembic ready, in which make a bed of one pound of roses, and over it another bed of one half of your aromates; next, ano|ther bed of one pound of violets of march, and over it a bed of the other half part of your aromates with a crucible of musk, and as much of ambergrise. Adapt the receiver to the bolt head, and distil the liquor by the gentle heat of a sand bath.</P>

Unlute again and put vinegar in the Alembic over the same faeces, and distil it likewise as you did the pre|ceding waters. That vinegar will have great virtues, and especially that of preserving you against an air in|fected by contagious and pestilential disorders.</P>

<HEAD>LXXXIV. The receipt of the syrup of orgeat of Montpellier.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Take a pound of barley which you soak in water; and, having peeled it grain by grain, make a knot of it in a bit of linen. Put this knot in a pot over the fire with about a quart of water. After having boiled it gently three or four hours, put into the water one pound of sweet almonds, which mix and dilute well in it. Then take off the knot of barley, which you pound like the almonds and mix like them in the water. Strain all together through a piece of linen; then pound the grounds well and pour all the water over it again, which stir all together and strain again. This water will look very thick. Put one pound of lump sugar in powder, to that liquor, and boil it into a syrup over a moderate fire. You will know that the syrup is done to its right degree if, letting one drop fall on the back of your hand, it remains in the form of a pearl. Then take it off from the fire, and when cold, give it what flavour

To make the draught which, in coffee houses or other places of refreshment, is called orgeat, put at the bottom of a decanter half an ounce, or one ounce, of that syrup and put common water over it, then shake the decanter well to mix the water and the syrup together. It is fit for drinking directly. In the summer you may cool it, if you chuse, in a pailful of ice and water, and you may add syrup, or water, to the first mixture, ac|cording as it wants to make it agreeable to the palate.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="87" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>LXXXVII. Directions for preparing the true coffee.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. True coffee must be torrified (vulgarly roasted) in an iron pan, or in a glazed earthen pan, over a clear charcoal fire without flames. Turn it with a wooden stick while it is on the fire, to make each grain take the roast more regularly and equally; and shake it now and then by tossing it up from the pan into the air, and in the pan again. It is well and sufficiently roasted when it is all of a dark brown, or the color of tan.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a much better method of roasting it which is infinitely less troublesome and more handy, by which coffee is excessively well and regularly roasted. It is by means of a certain iron drum made in the form of a la|dy's muff-box, with a handle at one end, an iron peg at the other, and a latch-door in the middle. By this door you introduce the coffee, which you fasten in by means of the latch. Then propping it on the top of a chafing-dish made on purpose, in which there is a char|coal fire, you roast the coffee by turning the drum over it with the above-mentioned handle; and thus the cof|fee roasts in the most regular manner.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the coffee is roasted, you grind it, in small mills which are made purposely for it, and the powder you keep closely confined in a leather bag, or better still, in those leaden boxes of Germany with a screwing lid. However it is still much preferable to grind no more at a time than what one wants to use at once.</P>
<P N="4">4. The liquor of coffee is made by putting one ounce of that powder to three quarters of a pint of boiling water to make three full dishes, or four small ones of coffee. And, after an infusion of five or ten minutes, du|ring which it is kept boiling, the coffee is fit for drink|ing.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="312" REF="029242_0175_0FDFFF0ACE4D50E0">
5. Observe that the strength of the powder occasions an effervescence in the water when you put it in boil|ing; therefore to avoid that inconveniency which would procure the loss of the most spirituous part of the coffee, you must take the water from off the fire and pour some into a cup first, before putting the powder into it, then stir with a long handled box spoon, the powder in the water, avoiding to touch the bottom of the coffee-pot, which would immediately make it rise and run over. If however, it should maugre all your cares, you then stop it by pouring on it the water which you spared on pur|pose for it in the cup from the beginning. Then, bring|ing it to the fire again, you let it boil gently, as we said before, the value of five or ten minutes.</P>
<P N="6">6. There are nice people who, not content with this plain way of preparing the liquor of coffee, make the following additions to it. First, they pour it clear from its ground into a silver, or other coffee-pot; and taking red-hot tongs from the fire, melt between them, over the liquor of coffee, two or three large nobs of su|gar, which drop from the tongs into it; then they ex|tinguish the tongs themselves in it afterwards. This ce|remony gives it, it must be confessed, an admirable fla|vour and most agreeable taste. Some put super-addi|tionally to it again one spoonful of the most perfect dis|tilled rose-water. This last is excessively good for head-achs if, while boiling hot, filling a cup with it and putting a tea spoonful of rose-water, you set your|self a-breathing the fumes: and, in order to breathe them more perfectly, throwing an handkerchief over your head; and letting drop over the cup, bring it round again to you, while you keep you nose over it. Thus you prevent the avaporation of the fumes, and gather them all yourself. There is not so strong a head-ach which can resist this operation.</P>

<HEAD>LXXXVIII. Directions for the preparing of tea.</HEAD>
<P>We should not have offered to speak here of the me|thod of preparing the liquor of tea in a nation wherein 
<PB N="313" REF="029242_0175_0FDFFF0ACE4D50E0">
the ladies make it one of their chief talents and most delightful past-time and amusement; and where it is so generally used, and become in some measure, so necessa|ry an evil, that such people might be found amongst the lower class as would rather renounce one meal than go without their tea even in the afternoon. But we have to mention two different methods of preparing that li|quor, after the Japanese fashion, whence the best tea comes, which, to say but little of them, seem not un|worthy of our notice, and, to do full justice to them, may be said to have a right to claim preference over the English method; the one for its superiority in point of flavour; the other for its advantage in point of eco|nomy.</P>
<P>The first method is to put in a bason whatever quan|tity of tea you like; then, pour boiling water over it: and after having covered it a reasonable time, drink it out of that very same bason, without ever adding any fresh water to the tea which remains at the bot|tom.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second is practised by the economists, who, in order to spare the quantity without losing any of the flavor, reduce the tea into an impalpable powder. This powder being put in the boiling water, incorporates with it in such a manner, that it seems as if it tinged it only, since nothing subsides at the bottom. By this means it is evident that a much smaller quantity is re|quired of this impalpable powder than of the leaves themselves: therefore that one pound must go infinitely farther, which must of some be advantage in a country where duties are so immense on that commodity.</P>
<P N="3">3. The French who have no notion of making tea one of their amusing entertainments and periodical objects of visiting, have a very bad method of making it. As they never use it but on physic days, and as a physic itself, they indeed make it as they would any preparation of that kind. In a coffee-pot they boil first their water; when this does boil, they put in their intended quanti|ty of tea, and let it throw one or two bubbles, then
<PB N="314" REF="029242_0176_0FDFFF0C65E88B48">
take it aside from the fire to let it infuse about half a quarter of an hour, after which they drink it by basons full, as here we do water gruel, to assist the physic and promote its effect.</P>
<P>Note. Those who are not used to regular and daily drinking of tea, have not a finer and more powerful re|medy against indigestions caused by repletion of the sto|mach, or excess of eating. One bason, or two, of ve|ry strong tea, drank hot, will, in less than half an hour, unstop all the conducts, and free all the passages.</P>

Stir all well while it boils; and when you judge it to be sufficiently done, pour the paste on a very smooth and polished table, that you may roll it and give it whatever form and shape you like.</P>
<P N="2">2. To drink it you prepare it with either milk or wa|ter, in which, when boiling-hot, you first dissolve it, then, with a box-mill, made on purpose, with a long handle, you mill it to froth in the pot in which it is a|making, and pour it afterwards in cups to drink.</P>

When all are ready, boil them four or five minutes, and throw the first water away because it is bit|ter.

<HEAD>XXIII. How to make a dry preserve of them.</HEAD>
<P>When you want to make them in dry preserve, or what is called mi-sucre, you must always proceed from beginning to end as above-directed, till the time they are fit for being potted in liquid, instead of which you take them again once more out of the syrup, and set them a-draining, then range them on states at regular distances, so that they may not touch one another. When thus prepared, powder on them, through a silk sieve, some of the finest loaf sugar pulverised, and put them in the stove to dry. When dry on that side, take them out from the slates, and turning them the other side upwards on a sieve, or some sort of small light willow grates made on purpose; powder them again with sugar as before, and when equally dried and cooled, you may put them in boxes with white brown paper.</P>
<P>Note. Some like to have them done in halves, other|wise called, in genteel term of art, en-oreilles, (in ears), which changes nothing in the process of the operation, but that of opening them in two from the beginning.&mdash;All sorts of plumbs, and the peach, admit of the same mode of operation, to make them into dry or liquid pre|serves, either whole, or in ears.</P>

<HEAD>XXIV. To preserve green apricots.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Gather yourself your apricots when green, that you may be sure they are all very fresh, and have not had time to wither. Then pound some salt in a mor|tar and make it as fine as you possibly can, and putting a
<PB N="325" REF="029242_0181_0FDFFF1C2C4FAC78">
handful of this salt in a napkin, with as many apricots as you think you can well manage; fold the napkin, lengthways, bringing the long sides of it over the apricots, and taking the ends of it gathered one in each hand, shake and roll them backwards and for|wards with the salt in the napkin, adding one spoonful or two if requisite, of vinegar, which pour over them when thus agitated. This process is with in|tention of curing them of their down, and when that is obtained, throw them in cold water to wash them well, and continue so to do with the rest, till they are all done.</P>
<P N="2">2. After having thus well washed them in that first water, put them into new cold water, to wash them well in it over again, after which put them a-draining on a sieve. Then boil some water, and throw them in, where|in they are to be kept boiling till they become soft, and which you take care to try now and then, by taking one or two with the skimmer, and thrusting in a wood|en toothpick, or very fine skewer; if this get an easy admittance in the apricots, they are sufficiently done. Now take the pan from the fire without delay, and with the skimmer, take the apricots from that boiling water into some cold.</P>
<P N="3">3. When your apricots are in this situation, make a syrup, by dissolving, boiling, and clarifying, according to art, as many pounds of sugar as you have got fruit, and, having put in your apricots, let them boil very gently. They will immediately turn of a very fine green. You must not press on the finishing of them; on the con|trary, take them off from the fire, and give them a cou|ple of hours rest, during which they soak in the syrup, throw off their moistness, and take the sugar. After they have thus rested a while, set them again on the fire, and finish them as fast you can, that they may preserve their greenness.</P>
<P>Note. There are some people who get the down off the apricots by means of a lye made with greenwood, or pearl ashes, in which they wash them once first, and then twice afterwards, in other pure and clean cold water. But the first method we have recommended
<PB N="326" REF="029242_0182_0FDFFF24E3F6B9E0">
with salt, is the best, the most expeditious, and that which procures them the finest green.&mdash;When you want your preserve to keep, you cannot do your syrup with less than pound for pound of sugar with fruit; but if they be not to keep, a little less may do.</P>

<HEAD>SECRETS relative to the Art of PREPARING SNUFF.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>I. How to reduce tobacco into powder.</HEAD>
<P>UNCORD the tobacco, and spread the leaves on a carpet to dry in the sun. Then pound them in a mortar, and sift through a coarse sieve to get the coars|est powder out of it. As for sifting, you must observe to do it in due proportion as you pound it, and not to pound much at a time. You may also take another me|thod, that of grinding it in one of those small mills which are made on purpose for grinding tobacco. By these means you may, without much trouble, make it as coarse and as fine as you like, by screwing tighter or slacker the nut.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>II. How to purge snuff, and prepare it for admitting of odours.</HEAD>
<P>Have a small tub pierced with a hole at bottom which you stop and unstop with a cork as you want it. In
<PB N="352" REF="029242_0195_0FDFFF50D4E13700">
this tub put a very thick and close weaved cloth which you turn over the rim of the tub and six there by the outside. Put your snuff in it, and pour water over it. After it shall have soaked thus twenty-four hours, un|stop the whole of the tub and let the water drain away, wringing the cloth in which it is, to help the expressi|on of the water. Repeat this operation three different times to purge it the better. When this operation is performed set the snuff to drying in the sun. When dry, put it again in the tub in the same manner as be|fore, and soak it again no more with common water, but with some smelling ones, such as for example orange|flower water, eau-d'ange, &amp;c. Twenty-four hours after let the water run off and drain, then set it in the sun to dry as before. In the mean while stir and asperse it again now and then without smelling water. Such is the indispensible preparation absolutely requisite to dis|pose snuff to receive the odour of flowers. If you do not care to have it so perfectly nice, and should not like to waste so much of it, you may give it but one wash of the common water. This moderate purgation will do pretty well, especially if, while it is a drying in the sun, you knead it the more often in proportion with your fragrant waters, and let it dry each time between.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>III. How to perfume snuff with flowers.</HEAD>
<P>The tuberose, the jessamine, the orange flowers and those are the roses which communicate the more easily their fragrancy to the snuff. To produce this, have a box lined with white paper perfectly dry, in which make a bed of snuff the thickness of an inch, then one of flow|ers, another of snuff and another of flowers again, conti|nuing so to do till you have employed all your snuff. Af|ter having let this stratification subsist for twenty-four hours, separate the flowers from the snuff by means of the sieve, and renew the same stratification again as before with new flowers. Continue thus to do till you find that your snuff has acquired a sufficient fragrancy from the flowers: then put it in lead boxes to keep it.</P>

<PB N="353" REF="029242_0195_0FDFFF50D4E13700">
<HEAD>IV. Another way to do the same.</HEAD>
<P>There are people who make the stratification another way. They inclose their flowers between sheets of white paper filled with pin-holes as thick as possible; this bed they lay between two of snuff; and, as for the small quantity which may have got in the papers through these holes, you sift it out by means of a sheer horse-hair sieve. The flowers must be renewed four or five times. This method seems the less troublesome, and the snuff catches the odour nearly as well.</P>

<P>A preparation of snuff may be made of an excessive nice fragrancy with buds of roses. The process is this. Rob those buds of their green cup and the pistillum which is in the middle, instead of which last you are skilfully to introduce a clove without damaging and breaking or loosening the rose leaves which are close|ly wrapped up one in another. Such buds, thus pre|pared, put into a glass vessel well covered over with a bladder and a leather besides, and expose them for a month in the sun, after which term you may make use of these buds as before directed for the other flow|ers.</P>

When that is executed you proceed, as before directed, to the alternate stratification of this mixture and of the snuff's powder.</P>

<HEAD>X. Another more simple remedy against ink when just spilled.</HEAD>
<P>Prejudice always did, and always will prove fatal, from the minutest to the most interesting circumstance in life. The time which is spent in lamenting over an accident, just happened before our own eyes, is but too often the only one which could have saved and prevented the dire consequences of it, nay perhaps repaired it in|tirely without leaving the least scar behind, had we ran instantly to the remedy. Ink never does nor can spoil the cloth, stuff, silk, lace, or linen on which it is spilled, unless it lies there to driness. And it is well known, on the other hand, that if you put as much water in your ink-horn, as there is ink, you make it too pale: if twice, still more so: if three, four, five, six, if twenty, if fifty times; then it will be such indeed that it will be no more ink at all. What could a pint of ink do in a quart of milk? A great deal of mischief without doubt. But, in fifty or a hundred gallons nothing at all. By parity of reasoning it must be obvious that if on the finest silk, cloth or velvet, muslin or lace ruffles, &amp;c. a whole phial of ink should be spilled, an undeterminate greater quantity of water than there was ink, poured instantly on the place, by degrees and not all at once, must weaken it to such a degree as to wash it off at last intirely. What rea|soning thus once dictated naturally, reiterated experi|ence
<PB N="360" REF="029242_0199_0FDFFF5D55C7E1C8">
since proved: therefore, here it is recommended. Sense only and judgment must be consulted in the exe|cution. As for example, if the ink be spilled on a ruf|fle or apron, &amp;c. while you have it on, let one hold the affected part between his two hands over a bason and rub it while another is pouring gradually water from a decanter; and let a whole pitcherful be used if necessa|ry. If the ruffle, apron, &amp;c. be at liberty and not actually worn on, the place dipped into a bason filled with water, and there squeezed and dipped in again, may do; provided you change the water in abundance, every two or three squeezes. If the ink be spilled on a green carpet table, it may immediately be taken out with a tea-spoon so that any water at all shall hardly be want|ed afterwards, provided it has not laid any time on it, and was only that instant spilled; as the down of the cloth prevents the immediate soaking of the ink or any liquor indeed (except oil) through and through. But if it have laid some time, let the time be ever so long, provided it is still wet, by pouring a little fresh clean water at a time on the place, and gathering it up each time with a spoon, and pressing hard to squeeze it out of the cloth into the spoon again, you will at last bring it to its natural color as if no such accident had ever happened. These few circumstances explained, are sufficient to guide any one, who has a common share of good sense and understanding, how to act on this princi|ple in others.</P>

<HEAD>V. Another superstitious method.</HEAD>
<P>As there is no extirpating from the narrow minds of low people, and that extirpating and exclaiming against it, is by no means persuasive nor successful, we cannot refrain however mentioning the following receipt which has been given us by an old obdurate fisherman, whom nothing could have persuaded against the absurdity of it. It will excite the laughter of some of our readers, while it will not fail to meet with simpletons enough to try again the experiment, in order to convince them|selves of the absurdity of such and the like prescrip|tions, as there are plenty in old women's books, for the head-achs, the gout, the rheumatism, the scaldings, the hooping-cough, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;"Whenever you want to assemble a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of fish in a particular place in the sea take three shells of them which grow among the rocks; and having taken out the fish which is in them, write with your own blood, in the inside of them, the two following words JA SABAOTH, and throw them in that part of the sea where you would have the fish gather.

<P><PB N="368" REF="029242_0203_0FDFFF60897F7CF0">
The absurdity of this secret is glaring, and stares one in the face in every word which composes it. First, the two words here recommended are meant for two Hebrew ones, the first of which, JA is cramped, and broken for JEHOVAH, which signifies God. Now if we may sup|pose any virtue in a word whatever, there can surely be none in the broken limbs of that word, therefore, the pretended secret must fail here and prove unsuccessful at the very first step whenever JA is used instead of JEHO|VAH.&mdash;Secondly if any virtue might be supposed to be attached to these words, that virtue must more na|turally be bound in them when spelled and written in their proper, peculiar, and original dress, than when painted by the borrowed uncertain and contested fi|gures peculiar to another language; whence it is plain that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="4 letters"> must be preferable in every respect, since they really express what is meant, and are not lia|ble to the accident of the corrupted JA for JEHOVAH.&mdash;A great deal more could be said on this subject, was it in a more proper place; but we forbear carrying the scope of our reflections any farther, in a book where|in on philosophical, still less theological matters, can with any propriety, find admittance.

<HEAD>IX. Another way.</HEAD>
<P>Put a-soaking some birds seed in good brandy, with a little white hellebore, and place it in some part of your garden as a bait for the birds which frequent it; and all those who shall eat of that seed will so suddenly be in|toxicated by it, that they will suffer themselves to be ta|ken by the hand.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>X. Another way.</HEAD>
<P>If you want to catch live swallows or crows, make papers in the form of a sugar loaf, with some strong brown or blue paper, the entrance of which rub in the inside with bird-lime, and bait at the bottom with some stinking piece of meat or carrion to intice them. By these means when they go to thrust their heads in those papers to take the meat, the lime catches hold of their feathers all about their neck and bead, and caps them in such a manner that they find themselves blinded, and cannot fly when they go to rise for it, which gives an opportunity of taking them alive with the hand.</P>

<HEAD>XII. To preserve and multiply pigeons.</HEAD>
<P>In a large devecote, prepare the following food, which will induce your pigeons to love their cote, and also to bring you a great many strangers when they go abroad.&mdash;Take thirty pounds of millet, three of cumin, five of honey, half a pound of bishop's-wort, otherwise costus, two pounds of agnus castus's seed, which boil in river water to the total evaporation of the last. Then in its stead pour a gallon and a half, or two gallons of red port, with about eight pounds of old mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tar well pulverised, which set on the fire again for about half an hour to concoct.

<HEAD>SECRETS relative to subjects entertaining and useful.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>I. To whiten wax.</HEAD>
<P>MELT it in a pipkin without boiling. Then take a wooden pestle, which steep in the wax two fing|ers' deep, and plunge immediately into cold water to loosen the wax from it, which will come off like sheets of paper. When you have thus got all your wax out of the pipkin, and made it into flakes, put it on a clean tow|el and expose it in the air on the grass till it is white. Then melt it again, and strain it through a muslin to take all the dirt out of it, if there be any.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>II. Another way of whitening wax in large manufacto|ries.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Melt your wax in a large copper, such as those brewing or washing coppers which are fixed in mortar. Near to the copper, have a kind of trough, made of oak or deal, and six or seven feet long, at the farther end of which a cock of cold water will be placed in the wall to fill it, and at the other, towards the copper, a tub laid upon it, to receive the wax from the copper. Let that tub have also a cock at four fingers breath from the bottom, and in that tub pour, with a wooden bowl, the melted hot wax from the copper. Cover it with a
<PB N="372" REF="029242_0205_0FDFFF6D4BE804F8">
blanket in four doublets to make it retain its heat, and let it rest thus a couple of hours to give time to the dirt and nastiness which may happen to be in it to settle at the bottom of the tub. When that is done, fill your trough with cold water; then have a kind of tin basket to sit the width of the trough so as to fit upon its edges, and bored at bottom with twelve or sixteen small holes, at equal and regular distances, and which you place so as to receive the melted wax from the cock of the tub, and render it in the trough through the said small holes of its bottom, while, with a polished wooden stick or roller, under the tub, and armed at both ends with iron in the form of a spit, and half of the thickness of which enters into the water, while the other keeps above it, you keep continually turning equally and regularly. This process will make the wax stake in the water into small ribbons as thin as silver paper. Now in sine clean hampers, or hand baskets, made of white peeled willow twigs, take your wax from the trough with a wooden shovel, and carry it to an open field, where lay it thick upon a thin coarse cloth in the sun, and turn it every other day once, for two weeks, run|ning, after which time it will be of a perfect white|ness.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now clean well your copper, and put in alum wa|ter to warm, in which throw your whitened wax, and stir well. When melted, renew the operation as before, and carry it again to the open field to expose it in the sun. In a week's time it will have its whiteness in the highest degree it can be carried to.</P>
<P N="3">3. Melt it then for the third and last time, and put it in small round cakes, which is done by casting it in small moulds carved purposely on several boards.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>III. How to multiply wax.</HEAD>
<P>Take bullock's suet, which pound well, and put a|soaking for seventy-two hours, in the strongest French wine-vinegar, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> afterwards for forty-eight hours, keeping perpetually skimming, as long as there appears
<PB N="373" REF="029242_0205_0FDFFF6D4BE804F8">
any scum upon it. When that is done, let it cool a while, and throw it afterwards into a tub of cold water, wherein beat and stir it till it resumes its wonted consist|ence and firmness. Then put it again into other fresh vinegar, and repeat they very same process <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> through and exactly for three different times. Next to that, gather the tops of rosemary, sage, bay, and mint, which pound and boil well in water, then strain through a double flan|nel bag. In this water, boil for the last time your pre|pared suet as before, and after it shall have boiled there one hour it will have no more any bad smell. To color it you must put one drachm of saffron to each pound of suet, and melt it afterwards with an equal quantity of real bees-wax, then it will be impossible to discover the mixture.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>IV. To make mutton suet candles, in imitation of wax candles.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Throw quick-lime in melted mutton suet; the lime will fall to the bottom, and carry along with it all the nastiness of the suet, so as to leave it as pure and fine as wax itself.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now, if with one part of that suet, you mix three of real wax, you will have very fine bougies, or real wax candles, in which nobody will ever be able to find out the mixture, not even in the moulding and casting way for figures or ornaments.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>V. To make soap.</HEAD>
<P>They generally make three sorts of soap, white, black, and marbled. The white, or, as it is called, the Genoa soap, is made with wood-ashes, Alicant kali, lime and olive oil. The black is made of the same materials, with this exception however, that it is made with the faeces and tartar of the oils. The marbled is made with Alicant kali, bourde, and lime; and when it is almost done, they take some red earth, which they call cinnabar, with cop|peras; they boil these together, and throw it in the cop|per
<PB N="374" REF="029242_0206_0FDFFF6F174D1A68">
wherein the soap is. It occasions a blue marbling, as long as the copperas keeps the better of the two ingredi|ents; but as soon as the cinnabar has at last absorbed the vitriol, this blue hue subsides intirely, and the red alone predominates.&mdash;In order therefore to form the soap, the method is to make different lyes with all these sorts of matters; and, when they are sufficiently charged (which beginners know by their carrying an egg swimming, without its sinking to the bottom, and experienced soap|boilers are judges of by degustation, and the time they have been at work) they put all these lyes in proper cop|pers, and pour at the same time, in Provence and Lan|guedoc, oil of olive; in Germany, grease; and in England, oil of fish. That done they boil all together with a great blasting fire; and eighteen, or twenty days afterwards these oils have so well aspired all the salts of the lye, that this is left quite flat and untasty. Then by the cocks which are at the bottom of the coppers, the water or lye is let out, and the lump of soap taken out and placed to dry in drying houses built on purpose, to make it take suffi|cient consistence, and such as we know it to have.</P>

<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>VI. To prevent any thing from burning in the fire.</HEAD>
<P>Pound into powder cherry-tree gum and alum in equal quantities, and imbibe that powder with strong wine-vinegar, which leave thus a digesting on warm ashes, for the space of twenty-four hours. If with this composition you rub any thing and throw it on the fire, it will not be consumed by it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>VII. To prevent burning one's fingers in melted lead.</HEAD>
<P>Take two ounces of bol armenian, one of quicksilver, half a one of camphire, and two of brandy. Mix all to|gether with the pestle in a brass mortar, and rub your hands with this composition, before steeping them into a pot of melted lead, and this will have no effect upon them.</P>

<PB N="375" REF="029242_0206_0FDFFF6F174D1A68">
<HEAD>VIII. A fire which cannot be extinguished by water.</HEAD>
<P>Take five ounces of gum powder; salt-petre, three; brimstone, two; camphire, rosin, and turpentine, one of each. Mix all together, and imbibe it with rectified oil of rosiny fir-tree. If you fill balls with this composi|tion, and throw them thirty feet deep in the water, they will burn still, even if you cover them entirely with mould.</P>

<DIV3 N="9" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>IX. To prevent the oil of a lamp from smoaking.</HEAD>
<P>Distil some onions, and put of the distilled liquor at the bottom of the lamp, and the oil over it, then you will see the oil will give no offensive smoke.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>X. Another receipt for the same purpose.</HEAD>
<P>Melt some May butter on the fire, without frying or boiling it, and throw common exsiccated salt in it. That salt will go to the bottom, and carry along with it the watery and earthen particles of the butter, so that this will turn into a very fine, clear, and limpid oil, which, when burnt in the lamp, will render no smoke.</P>

<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>XI. To make an incombustible wick.</HEAD>
<P>Take a long piece of feathered alum, which cut of what size you like, and bore in its length several holes with a large needle; then put this wick in the lamp: the oil will ascend through these holes, and if you light it, you will see the effect of it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="12" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>XII. A stone which is inflammable with water.</HEAD>
<P>Take quick-lime, refined salt-petre, Alexandrian tutty, and calaminary stone, in equal quantities, with brim|stone and camphire, of each two quarts. Put all into subtile powder, and sift it through the finest sieve. Then
<PB N="376" REF="029242_0207_0FDFFF70C76923F8">
put all into a new piece of cloth, and tie it very close and tight. Put this knot into a crucible, which cover with another crucible, and lute well with greasy clay. Let the lute and all be set in the sun, or over a baker's oven, to dry. After which time place these crucibles in a brick kiln, and do not take them out before the bricks are baked. Then you will find a stone, which the least drop of water will inflame, so as to light a match if you put it to it. To put it out you only blow upon it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="13" TYPE="method">
<HEAD>XIII. A receipt to make the true phosphorus, extracted from urine, and which is inflammable by the air, so that two pieces of wood may be lighted by it.</HEAD>
<P>Put a large quantity of chamber lye in bottles, which set in the sun during the dog-days, till the urine become entirely foetid. In proportion as the urine diminishes in the bottles by the evaporation the heat occasions, let them be filled again by pouring from the one into the others but not by any fresh urine. When it is come to its utmost degree of corruption, put it into a glass retort on a sand bath; and having luted a bladder for receiver, there will arise first a spirit, and next a phlegm. When the distillation is ended, and you see that nothing more arises, let the retort cool, and unlute it to fill it again with new urine of the same degree of corruption as the last. Lute and distil again as you did before, first the spirit, and then the phlegm, continuing so to do (that is to say to unlute, fill again and distil) till you find you have got at the bottom of the retort a good quantity of faeces.&mdash;Observe and be very careful at every distilla|tion not to force the distillation beyond the phlegm. But when it comes for the last time, re-adapt the bladder, and give the gradual rising fire till the oil ascends in which case, keep up your fire to that degree, and when you see it stops, then is the time to increase your fire, to force out any thing which can be forced and distilled from it. When that is done, let the resort cool, and break it. Therein you will find two sorts of matters; the one rare and spongy, which occupies the upper part,
<PB N="377" REF="029242_0207_0FDFFF70C76923F8">
and another under, very nasty and tartarous. Separate carefully, and dexterously with a wooden knife, or spa|tula, the uppermost matter from the undermost. Put the spongy one in a new retort, and give a gradual fire on the sand bath. The first which arises will be an oil which you put aside: the next will be a matter not unlike melt|ed sulphur. Then take the oil which first ascended, and mix it with that of the preceding distillation, which pour all together on the residue of this second one, and set it on a very slow fire, to exhaust gently all the humidity from it. Then empty this humidity or phlegm out of the receiver, and replace it with clear and clean water; and, having re-adapted it to the retort, distil all your greasy and bituminous oil; it will come out like stars and spangles of fire which will fall into the receiver. But then is the time to take care and not be too hasty by pushing the fire too hard, for you would cause the break|ing of the retort, and lose at once all the fruit of you labour.&mdash;The operation being therefore well conducted throughout, you will find your matter at the bottom of the receiver: break it into several pieces, put it in a phial with water, and cork it well. Such is the true process to be observed in making the phosphorus from urine, which had not hitherto been faithfully and accu|rately described in books of this nature, and which we here publish from experience.</P>
