<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE generality of tho&s;e geographers, who have attempted a map, or de&s;cription of A|merica, &s;eem either to have had no knowledge of Kentucke, or to have neglected it, although a place of infinite importance: And the re&s;t have proceeded &s;o erroneou&s;ly, that they have left the world as much in darkne&s;s as before. Many are the mi&s;takes, re|&s;pecting the &s;ubject of this work, in all other maps which I have yet &s;een; whereas I can truly &s;ay, I know of none in that which I here pre&s;ent to the world either from my own particular knowledge, or from the information of tho&s;e gentlemen with who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance I have been favoured, and who have been well acquainted with the country &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettle|ment. When I vi&s;ited Kentucke, I found it &s;o far to exceed my expectations, although great, that I con|cluded it was a pity, that the world had not adequate information of it. I conceived that a proper de&s;crip|tion, and map of it, were objects highly intere&s;ting to the United States; and therefore, incredible as it may appear to &s;ome, I mu&s;t declare, that this perform|ance is not publi&s;hed from lucrative motives, but &s;olely to inform the world of the happy climate, and
<PB N="6" REF="018467_0004_0FA7A6755E25BA48">
plentiful &s;oil of this favoured region. And I ima|gine the reader will believe me the more ea&s;ily when I inform him, that I am not an inhabitant of Kentuc|ke, but having been there &s;ome time, by my acquain|tance in it, am &s;ufficiently able to publi&s;h the truth, and from principle, have cautiou&s;ly endeavoured to avoid every &s;pecies of fal&s;ehood. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this encourages me to hope for the public candour, where errors may po&s;&s;ibly be found. The three gentlemen honouring this work with their recommen|dation, Col. Boon, Col. Todd, and Col. Harrod, were among the fir&s;t &s;ettlers, and perfectly well acquaint|ed with the country. To them I acknowledge my&s;elf much indebted for their friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this work, which they chearfully contributed with a di&s;intere&s;ted view of being &s;erviceable to the public. My thanks are more e&s;pecially due to Col. Boon, who was earli|er acquainted with the &s;ubject of this performance than any other now living, as appears by the ac|count of his adventures, which I e&s;teemed curious and intere&s;ting, and therefore have publi&s;hed them from his own mouth. Much advantage may po&s;&s;i|bly ari&s;e to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of this book, as tho&s;e who wi&s;h to travel in Kentucke will undoubtedly find it a Compleat Guide. To &s;uch I affirm, that there is nothing mentioned or de&s;cribed but what they will find true. Con&s;cious that it would be of general utility, I have omitted nothing, and been exceeding particu|lar in every part. That it may have the de&s;ired effect, is the &s;incere wi&s;h of</P>

<HEAD>THE DISCOVERY, PURCHASE AND SETTLEMENT, OF KENTUCKE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t white man we have certain ac|counts of, who di&s;covered this province, was one James M'Bride, who, in company with &s;ome others, in the year 1754, pa&s;&s;ing down the Ohio in Canoes, landed at the mouth of Ken|tucke river, and there marked a tree, with the fir&s;t letters of his name, and the date, which remain to this day. The&s;e men reconnoitred the country, and returned home with the plea&s;|ing news of their di&s;covery of the be&s;t tract of land in North-America, and probably in the
<PB N="8" REF="018467_0007_0FA7A676B45E9208">
world. From this period it remained concealed till about the year 1767, when one John Finley, and &s;ome others, trading with the Indians, for|tunately travelled over the fertile region, now called Kentucke, then but known to the Indi|ans, by the name of the Dark and Bloody Ground, and &s;ometimes the Middle Ground. This country greatly engaged Mr. Finley's attention. Some time after, di&s;putes ari&s;ing between the Indians and traders, he was obliged to decamp; and returned to his place of re&s;i|dence in North-Carolina, where he communi|cated his di&s;covery to Col. Daniel Boon, and a few more, who conceiving it to be an inter|e&s;ting object, agreed in the year 1769 to un|dertake a journey in order to explore it. After a long fatiguing march, over a mountainous wilderne&s;s, in a we&s;tward direction, they at length arrived upon its borders; and from the top of an eminence, with joy and wonder, de|&s;cried the beautiful land&s;cape of Kentucke. Here they encamped, and &s;ome went to hunt provi&s;ions, which were readily procured, there being plenty of game, while Col. Boon and John Finley made a tour through the country, which they found far exceeding their expec|tations, and returning to camp, informed their companions of their di&s;coveries: But in &s;pite of this promi&s;ing beginning, this company, meeting with nothing but hard&s;hips and adver|&s;ity,
<PB N="9" REF="018467_0008_0FA7A677627BBE58">
grew exceedingly di&s;heartened, and was plundered, di&s;per&s;ed, and killed by the Indians, except Col. Boon, who continued an inhabitant of the wilderne&s;s until the year 1771, when he returned home.</P>
<P>About this time Kentucke had drawn the at|tention of &s;everal gentlemen. Doctor Walk|er of Virginia, with a number more, made a tour we&s;tward for di&s;coveries, endeavouring to find the Ohio river; and afterwards he and Gene|ral Lewis, at Fort Stanwix, purcha&s;ed from the Five Nations of Indians the lands lying on the north &s;ide of Kentucke. Col. Donald&s;on, of Virginia, being employed by the State to run a line from &s;ix miles above the Long I&s;land, on Hol&s;tein, to the mouth of the great Kenhawa, and finding thereby that an exten&s;ive tract of excellent country would be cut off to the Indi|ans, was &s;olicited, by the inhabitants of Clench and Hol&s;tein, to purcha&s;e the lands lying on the north &s;ide of Kentucke river from the Five Na|tions. This purcha&s;e he compleated for five hundred pounds, &s;pecie. It was then agreed, to fix a boundary line, running from the long I&s;land on Hol&s;tein to the head of Kentucke ri|ver: thence down the &s;ame to the mouth; thence up the Ohio, to the mouth of Great Kenhawa; but this valuable purcha&s;e the State refu&s;ed to confirm.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="018467_0009_0FA7A67E5854BAB0">Col. Hender&s;on, of North-Carolina, being informed of this country by Col. Boon, he, and &s;ome other gentlemen, held a treaty with the Cherokee Indians at Wataga, in March 1775, and then purcha&s;ed from them the lands lying on the &s;outh &s;ide of Kentucke river for goods, at valuable rates, to the amount of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds, &s;pecie.</P>
<P>Soon after this purcha&s;e, the State of Virginia took the alarm, agreed to pay the money Col. Donald&s;on had contracted for, and then di&s;|puted Col. Hender&s;on's right of purcha&s;e, as a private gentlemen of another &s;tate, in behalf of him&s;elf: However, for his eminent &s;ervices to this country, and for having been in&s;trumental in making &s;o valuable an acqui&s;ition to Virginia, that &s;tate was plea&s;ed to reward him with a tract of land, at the mouth of Green River, to the amount of two hundred thou&s;and acres; and the &s;tate of North-Carolina gave him the like quantity in Powel's Valley. This region was formerly claimed by various tribes of Indians; who&s;e title, if they had any, originated in &s;uch a manner, as to render it doubtful which ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s it: Hence this fertile &s;pot became an object of contention, a theatre of war, from which it was properly denominated the Bloody-Grounds. Their contentions not being likely to decide the Right to any particular tribe, as
<PB N="11" REF="018467_0010_0FA7A67F2A56C690">
&s;oon as Mr. Hender&s;on and his friends propo&s;ed to purcha&s;e, the Indians agreed to &s;ell; and notwith&s;tanding the valuable Con&s;ideration they received, have continued ever &s;ince trouble&s;ome neighbours to the new &s;ettlers.</P>

<HEAD>SITUATION and BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>KENTUCKE is &s;ituated, in its central part, near the latitude of 38&deg; north, and 85&deg; we&s;t longitude, and lying within the fifth cli|mate, its longe&s;t day is 14 hours 40 minutes. It is bounded on the north by great Sandy-creek; by the Ohio on the N. W. by North-Carolina on the &s;outh; and by the Cumberland moun|tain on the ea&s;t, being upwards of 250 miles in length, and two hundred in breadth; and is at pre&s;ent divided into three counties, Lincoln, Fayette and Jeffer&s;on; of which Fayette and Jeffer|&s;on are bounded by the Ohio, and the river Ken|tucke &s;eparates Fayette on its north &s;ide from the other two. There are at pre&s;ent eight towns laid off, and building; and more are propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Loui&s;ville, at the Falls of Ohio, and Beards|town, are in Jeffer&s;on county; Harrod&s;burg, Danville, and Boons-burrow, in Lincoln coun|ty; Lexington, Lees-town, and Greenville, in Fayette county; the two la&s;t being on Kentuc|ke river. At the&s;e and many other places, on
<PB N="12" REF="018467_0011_0FA7A67FAF2E8D60">
this and other rivers, in&s;pecting-hou&s;es are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for Tobacco, which may be cultivated to great advantage; although not altogether the &s;taple commodity of the country.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE beautiful river Ohio, bounds Kentucke in its whole length, being a mile and &s;ometimes le&s;s in breadth, and is &s;ufficient to carry boats of great burthen. Its general cour&s;e is &s;outh 60 degrees we&s;t; and in its cour&s;e it receives numbers of large and &s;mall rivers, which pay tribute to its glo|ry. The only di&s;advantage this fine river has, is a rapid, one mile and an half long, and one mile and a quarter broad, called the Falls of Ohio. In this place the river runs over a rocky bottom, and the de&s;cent is &s;o gradual, that the fall does not probably in the whole exceed twenty feet. In &s;ome places we may ob&s;erve it to fall a few feet. When the &s;tream is low, empty boats only can pa&s;s and repa&s;s this ra|pid; their lading mu&s;t be tran&s;ported by land; but when high, boats of any burthen may pa&s;s in &s;afety. Excepting this place, there is not a finer river in the world for navigation by boats. Be&s;ides this, Kentucke is watered by eight &s;mal|ler rivers, and many large and &s;mall creeks, as may be ea&s;ily &s;een in the map.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="018467_0012_0FA7A6806F0ED830">Licking River heading in the mountains with Cumberland River, and the North Branch of Kentucke, runs in a N. W. direction for up|wards of a hundred miles, collecting its &s;ilver &s;treams from many branches, and is about one hundred yards broad at its mouth.</P>
<P>Red River heads and interlocks with the main branch of Licking, and flows in a S. We&s;t cour&s;e into Kentucke River, being about &s;ixty miles long, and &s;ixty yards wide at its mouth.</P>
<P>The Kentucke River ri&s;es with three heads from a mountainous part of the Country. Its northern branch interlocks with Cumberland; runs half way in a we&s;tern direction, and the other half N. we&s;terly. It is amazingly crook|ed, upwards of two hundred miles in length, and about one hundred and fifty yards broad.</P>
<P>Elkhorn is a &s;mall river which empties it&s;elf into Kentucke in a N. W. by W. cour&s;e; is about fifty miles long, and fifty yards broad at the mouth.</P>
<P>Dick's River joins the Kentucke in a N. We&s;t direction; is about forty-five miles long, and forty-five yards wide at its mouth. This river curiou&s;ly heads and interlocks its branches with Salt River, Green River, and the waters
<PB N="14" REF="018467_0013_0FA7A684CA543DC8">
of Rock-ca&s;tle River.&mdash;Salt River ri&s;es at four different places near each other. The windings of this river are curious, rolling its &s;treams round a &s;pacious tract of fine land, and uniting almo&s;t fifteen miles before they approach the Ohio, and twenty miles below the Falls. It is amazingly crooked, runs a we&s;tern cour&s;e near ninety miles, and is about eighty yards wide at the mouth.</P>
<P>Green River interlocking with the heads of Dick's River, as mentioned above, is al&s;o a|mazingly crooked, keeps a we&s;tern cour&s;e for upwards of one hundred and fifty miles, and is about eighty yards wide at its mouth, which is about two hundred and twenty miles below the Falls.</P>
<P>Cumberland River, interlocks with the north|ern branch of Kentucke, as afore&s;aid, and rol|ling round the other arms of Kentucke, among the mountains, in a &s;outhern cour&s;e for one hundred miles; then in a &s;outh we&s;tern cour&s;e for above one hundred miles; then in a &s;outh|ern and S. we&s;tern cour&s;e for about two hun|dred and fifty more, finds the Ohio, four hun|dred and thirteen miles below the Falls. At the &s;ettlements it is two hundred yards broad; and at its mouth three hundred, having pa&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="15" REF="018467_0014_0FA7A685A1DA8CB8">
through North-Carolina in about half its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Great Kenhawa, or New River, ri&s;es in North-Carolina, runs a northern, and N. We&s;t cour&s;e for upwards of four hundred miles, and finds the Ohio four hundred miles above the Falls. It is about five hundred yards wide at its mouth. The&s;e two rivers are ju&s;t mentioned, being beyond our limits. They run contrary cour&s;es, are exceeding large, and it is worth notice, that Clench, Hol&s;tein, Nolachuckey, and French-Broad rivers, take their ri&s;e between the&s;e two, or rather we&s;tward of New River, &s;ome of them ri&s;ing and interlocking with it; and when they meet, form what is called the Tene&s;e, or Cherokee River, which runs a we&s;t|ern cour&s;e, and finds the Ohio twelve miles below Cumberland River. It is very large, and has &s;pacious tracts of fine land.</P>
<P>The&s;e rivers are navigable for boats almo&s;t to their &s;ources, without rapids, for the great|e&s;t part of the year. This country is ge|nerally level, and abounding with lime&s;tone, which u&s;ually lies about &s;ix feet deep, except in hollows, where &s;treams run, where we find the rock in the bottom of the channel.</P>
<P>The &s;prings and &s;treams le&s;&s;en in June, and
<PB N="16" REF="018467_0015_0FA7A685A8F5E2B8">
continue low, hindering navigation, until No|vember, when the autumnal rains &s;oon pre|pare the rivers for boats, and repleni&s;h the whole country with water; but although the &s;treams decrea&s;e, yet there is always &s;ufficient for dome&s;tic u&s;es. There are many fine &s;prings, that never fail; every farmer has a good one at lea&s;t; and excellent wells may ea&s;ily be dug.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>NATURE of the SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>THE country, in &s;ome parts, is nearly level; in others not &s;o much &s;o; in others again hilly, but moderately, and in &s;uch places there is mo&s;t water. The levels are not like a carpet, but inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;mall ri&s;ings, and declivi|ties, which form a beautiful pro&s;pect. A great part of the &s;oil is amazingly fertile; &s;ome not &s;o good, and &s;ome poor. The inhabitants di&s;|tingui&s;h its quality by fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third rate lands; and &s;carcely any &s;uch thing as a mar&s;h or &s;wamp is to be found. There is a ridge, where Kentucke ri&s;es, nearly of the &s;ize of a mountain, which in the map we have repre&s;ented as &s;uch.</P>
<P>All the land below the Great Kenhawa un|til we come near the waters of Licking River is broken, hilly, and generally poor; except in &s;ome valleys, and on Little and Big Sandy
<PB N="17" REF="018467_0016_0FA7A68662A314A8">
creeks, where there is &s;ome fir&s;t rate land, but mo&s;tly &s;econd and third rate. It is &s;aid, that near this water is found a pure &s;alt rock. Up|on the north branch of Licking, we find a great body of fir&s;t rate land. This &s;tream runs near|ly parallel to the Ohio for a con&s;iderable di|&s;tance, and is about &s;even miles from the mouth of Lime&s;tone Creek, where is a fine harbour for boats coming down the Ohio, and now a common landing. It is &s;ixty-five miles from Lexington, to which there is a large waggon road. The main branch of Licking, is about twenty-two miles from Lime&s;tone. On this &s;tream we find &s;ome fir&s;t, but mo&s;tly &s;econd and third rate lands, and towards its head &s;omething hilly. There we find the Blue Licks, two fine &s;alt &s;prings, where great plenty of &s;alt may be made. Round the&s;e licks, the &s;oil is poor for &s;ome di&s;tance, being much impregnat|ed with &s;alt.</P>
<P>The &s;outhern branch of Licking, and all its other arms, as appears in the map, &s;pread through a great body of fir&s;t, and &s;ome &s;econd rate land, where there is abundance of cane, and &s;ome &s;alt licks, and &s;prings. On the&s;e &s;eve|ral branches of Licking, are good mill-&s;eats, and navigation to the Ohio, from the fork down to its mouth. The land is hilly, and generally
<PB N="18" REF="018467_0017_0FA7A68722B21480">
poor, yet along the &s;treams and in valleys we find &s;ome excellent land.</P>
<P>The Elkhorn lands are much e&s;teemed, being &s;ituated in a bend of Kentucke River, of great extent, in which this little river, or rather large creek, ri&s;es. Here we find mo&s;tly fir&s;t rate land, and near the Kentucke River &s;econd and third rate. This great tract is beautifully &s;itu|ated, covered with cane, wild rye, and clover; and many of the &s;treams afford fine mill &s;eats.</P>
<P>The lands below the mouth of Elkhorn, up Eagle Creek, and towards the Ohio, are hilly and poor, except tho&s;e contained in a great bend of the Ohio, oppo&s;ite Great Miami, cut off, as appears in the map, by the Big-bone and Bank-lick creeks, interlocking, and run|ning &s;eparate cour&s;es. Here we find a great deal of good land, but &s;omething hilly.</P>
<P>On Kentucke River we find many fertile valleys, or bottoms along the river, e&s;pecially towards its ri&s;e. There is good land al&s;o on Red River, but towards the heads of this, and Kentucke, the &s;oil is broken; but even here, we find in valleys, and along &s;treams, a great deal of fruitful land. Generally the &s;oil within a mile or two of Kentucke River is of the third
<PB N="19" REF="018467_0018_0FA7A687E1D679C0">
and fourth rates; from about that di&s;tance, as we leave it on either &s;ide, we approach good lands. The country through which it winds its cour&s;e, for the mo&s;t part, may be con&s;idered as level to its banks, or rather precipices; from the brow of which, we behold the river, three and &s;ometimes four hundred feet deep, like a great canal For a more particular account of this, we refer the reader to where we treat of the cu|rio&s;ities of Kentucke.</P>
<P>Dick's River runs through a great body of fir&s;t rate land, abounding every where with cane, and affords many excellent mill &s;eats. Many mills are already built on this &s;tream, &s;ome of which are repre&s;ented in the map, and will have a plentiful &s;upply of water in the dry|e&s;t &s;ea&s;ons. The banks of this river, near its mouth, are &s;imilar to the banks of Kentucke. The &s;everal &s;treams and branches of Salt River afford excellent mill &s;eats. The&s;e roll them|&s;elves through a great tract of excellent land, but the country from the junction of the&s;e waters, and &s;ome miles above towards the Ohio, which may be about twenty-five miles, is level and poor, and has abundance of ponds. For a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the head of this river, the land is of the fir&s;t quality, well &s;itu|ated, and abounds with fine cane. Upon this,
<PB N="20" REF="018467_0019_0FA7A688A1F2C7D8">
and Dick's River, the inhabitants are chiefly &s;et|tled, it being the &s;afe&s;t part of the country from the incur&s;ions of the Indians.</P>
<P>Green River, affords excellent mill &s;eats, and a con&s;tant &s;tream. This is allowed to be the be&s;t watered part of Kentucke. On its banks we find many fine bottoms, &s;ome fir&s;t rate, but mo&s;tly &s;econd and third rate lands; and at &s;ome di&s;tance, many knobs, ridges, and broken poor land. Below a creek, called Sinking Creek, on this river, within fifty miles of Ohio, towards Salt River, a great territory begins, called Green River Barrens, extending to the Ohio. Mo&s;t of this is very good land, and level. It has no timber, and little water, but affords excellent pa&s;turage for cattle. On &s;ome parts of this river, we find abundance of cane, &s;ome &s;alt licks, and &s;ulphureous and bituminous &s;prings. South of Green River, in the lands re&s;erved for the continental, and &s;tate troops of Virginia, an exceeding valuable lead mine has lately been di&s;covered. Iron ore is found on Rough Creek, a &s;tream running into this river. That part of Cumberland River which is in the Kentucke country, traver&s;es a hilly poor land, though in &s;ome parts we find good &s;oil along its &s;ides. The other rivers I mentioned (viz.

<HEAD>AIR AND CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS country is more temperate and healthy than the other &s;ettled parts of America. In Summer it wants the &s;andy heats which Virginia and Carolina experience, and receives a fine air
<PB N="22" REF="018467_0021_0FA7A68A245CBF10">
from its rivers. In Winter, which at mo&s;t only la&s;ts three months, commonly two, and is but &s;eldom &s;evere, the people are &s;afe in bad hou&s;es; and the bea&s;ts have a good &s;upply without fodder. The Winter begins about Chri&s;tmas, and ends about the fir&s;t of March, at farthe&s;t does not exceed the middle of that month. Snow &s;eldom falls deep or lies long. The we&s;t winds often bring &s;torms, and the ea&s;t winds clear the &s;ky; but there is no &s;teady rule of weather in that re&s;pect as in the northern &s;tates. The we&s;t winds are &s;ometimes cold and nitrous. The Ohio running in that direction, and there being mountains on that quarter, the we&s;terly winds by &s;weeping along their tops, in the cold regions of the air, and over a long tract of frozen water, collect cold in their cour&s;e, and convey it over the Kentuc|ke country; but the weather is not &s;o inten&s;ely &s;evere as the&s;e winds bring with them in Penn&s;yl|vania. The air and &s;ea&s;ons depend very much on the winds, as to heat and cold, dryne&s;s and moi&s;ture.</P>

<HEAD>SOIL AND PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;oil of Kentucke is of a loo&s;e, deep black mould, without &s;and, in the fir&s;t rate lands about two or three feet deep, and exceeding lux|urious in all its productions. In &s;ome places the mould inclines to brown. In &s;ome the wood, as
<PB N="23" REF="018467_0022_0FA7A7E563200120">
the natural con&s;equence of too rich a &s;oil, is of little value, appearing like dead timber and large &s;tumps in a field lately cleared. The&s;e parts are not con&s;iderable. The country in general may be con&s;idered as well timbered, producing large trees of many kinds, and to be exceeded by no country in variety. Tho&s;e which are peculiar to Kentucke are the &s;ugar-tree, which grows in all parts in great plenty, and furni&s;hes every family with plenty of excellent &s;ugar. The honey-locu&s;t is curiou&s;ly &s;urrounded with large thorny &s;pikes, bearing broad and long pods in form of peas, has a &s;weet ta&s;te, and makes excellent beer.</P>
<P>The coffee-tree greatly re&s;embles the black oak, grows large, and al&s;o bears a pod, in which is enclo&s;ed good coffee. The pappa-tree does not grow to a great &s;ize, is a &s;oft wood, bears a fine fruit much like a cucumber in &s;hape and &s;ize, and ta&s;tes &s;weet. The cucumber-tree is &s;mall and &s;oft, with remarkable leaves, bears a fruit much re&s;embling that from which it is nam|ed. Black mulberry-trees are in abundance. The wild cherry-tree is here frequent, of a large &s;ize, and &s;upplies the inhabitants with boards for all their buildings. Here al&s;o is the buck-eye, an exceeding &s;oft wood, bearing a remarkable black fruit, and &s;ome other kinds of trees not common el&s;ewhere. Here is great plenty of fine cane, on which the cattle feed, and grow fat. This plant
<PB N="24" REF="018467_0023_0FA7A7E6234D1430">
in general grows from three to twelve feet high, of a hard &s;ub&s;tance, with joints at eight or ten inches di&s;tance along the &s;talk, from which proceed leaves re&s;embling tho&s;e of the willow. There are many cane brakes &s;o thick and tall that it is difficult to pa&s;s through them. Where no cane grows there is a|bundance of wild-rye, clover, and buffalo-gra&s;s, covering va&s;t tracts of country, and affording ex|cellent food for cattle. The fields are covered with abundance of wild herbage not common to other countries. The Shawane&s;e &s;allad, wild let|tuce, and pepper-gra&s;s, and many more, as yet unknown to the inhabitants, but which, no doubt, have excellent virtues. Here are &s;een the fine&s;t crown-imperial in the world, the car|dinal flower, &s;o much extolled for its &s;carlet co|lour; and all the year, excepting the three Winter months, the plains and valleys are adorned with variety of flowers of the mo&s;t admirable beauty. Here is al&s;o found the tulip-bearing laurel-tree, or magnolia, which has an exqui&s;ite &s;mell, and con|tinues to blo&s;&s;om and &s;eed for &s;everal months together.</P>
<P>This country is riche&s;t on the higher lands, exceeding the fine&s;t low grounds in the &s;ettled parts of the continent. When cultivated it pro|duces in common fifty and &s;ixty bu&s;hels per a|cre; and I have heard it affirmed by credible per&s;ons, that above one hundred bu&s;hels of good

corn were produced from an acre in one &s;ea&s;on. The fir&s;t rate land is too rich for wheat till it has been reduced by four or five years cultivation.</P>
<P>Col. Harrod, a gentleman of veracity in Ken|tucke, has lately experienced the production of &s;mall grain, and affirms, that he had thirty-five bu&s;hels of wheat, and fifty bu&s;hels of rye per a|cre.</P>
<P>I think in common the land will produce a|bout thirty bu&s;hels of wheat, and rye, upon a moderate computation, per acre; and this is the general opinion of the inhabitants. We may &s;uppo&s;e that barley and oats will increa&s;e abun|dantly; as yet they have not been &s;ufficiently tried. The &s;oil is very favourable to flax and hemp, turnips, potatoes and cotton, which grow in abundance; and the &s;econd, third and fourth rate lands, are as proper for &s;mall grain. The&s;e accounts of &s;uch amazing fertility may, to &s;ome, appear incredible, but are certainly true. Every hu&s;bandman may have a good gar|den, or meadow, without water or manure, where he plea&s;es. The &s;oil, which is not of a thir|&s;ty nature, is commonly well &s;upplied with plen|tiful &s;howers.</P>
<P>Iron ore and lead are found in abundance, but we do not hear of any &s;ilver or gold mine as yet di&s;|covered.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="018467_0025_0FA7A7E8DDC55A68">The we&s;tern waters produce plenty of fi&s;h and fowl. The fi&s;h common to the waters of the Ohio are the buffalo-fi&s;h, of a large &s;ize, and the cat-fi&s;h &s;ometimes exceeding one hundred weight. Salmons have been taken in Kentucke weighing thirty weight. The mullet, rock, perch, gar-fi&s;h, and eel, are here in plenty. It is &s;aid that there are no trouts in the we&s;tern wa|ters. Suckers, &s;un-fi&s;h, and other hook-fi&s;h, are abundant; but no &s;had, or herrings.

On the&s;e wa|ters, and e&s;pecially on the Ohio, the gee&s;e and ducks are amazingly numerous.</P>
<P>The land fowls are turkeys, which are very frequent, phea&s;ants, partridges, and ravens: The perraquet, a bird every way re&s;embling a parrot, but much &s;maller; the ivory-bill wood-cock, of a whiti&s;h colour with a white plume, flies &s;cream|ing exceeding &s;harp.

<P>AMONG the native animals are the urus, or zorax, de&s;cribed by Ce&s;ar, which we call a buffa|lo, much re&s;embling a large bull, of a great &s;ize, with a large head, thick &s;hort crooked horns, and broader in his forepart than behind. Upon his &s;houlder is a large lump of fle&s;h, covered with a thick bo&s;s of long wool and curly hair, of a dark brown colour. They do not ri&s;e from the ground as our cattle, but &s;pring up at once up|on their feet; are of a broad make and clum&s;y appearance, with &s;hort legs, but run fa&s;t, and turn not a&s;ide for any thing when cha&s;ed, except a &s;tanding tree. They weigh from five to ten hundred weight, are excellent meat, &s;upplying the inhabitants in many parts with beef, and their hides make good leather. I have heard a hunter a&s;&s;ert, he &s;aw above one thou&s;and buffaloes at the Blue Licks at once; &s;o nume|rous were they before the fir&s;t &s;ettlers had wan|tonly &s;ported away their lives.

<P>There are &s;till to be found many deer, elks and bears, within the &s;ettlement, and many more on the borders of it. There are al&s;o panthers, wild|cats, and wolves.</P>
<P>The waters have plenty of beavers, otters, minks, and mu&s;k-rats: Nor are the animals common to other parts wanting, &s;uch as foxes, rabbits, &s;quir|rels, racoons, ground-hogs, pole-cats, and op|po&s;&s;ums.

thou&s;and &s;ouls: So amazingly rapid has been the &s;ettlement in a few years.

The inhabitants, at pre&s;ent, have not ex|traordinary good hou&s;es, as u&s;ual in a newly &s;ettled country.</P>
<P>They are, in general, polite, humane, ho&s;pita|ble, and very complai&s;ant. Being collected from different parts of the continent, they have a diver&s;ity of manners, cu&s;toms and religions, which may in time perhaps be modified to one u|niform. As yet united to the State of Virginia, they are governed by her whole&s;ome laws, which are virtuou&s;ly executed, and with excellent deco|rum, Schools for education are formed, and a college is appointed by act of A&s;&s;embly of Vir|ginia, to be founded under the conduct of tru&s;|tees in Kentucke, and endowed with lands for its u&s;e. An excellent library is likewi&s;e be&s;tow|ed upon this &s;eminary, by the Rev. John Todd, of Virginia.</P>
<P>The Anabapti&s;ts were the fir&s;t that promoted public wor&s;hip in Kentucke; and the Pre&s;byte|rians have formed three large congregations near Harrod's &s;tation, and have engaged the Rev. Da|vid Rice, of Virginia, to be their pa&s;tor. At

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST the natural curio&s;ities of this country, the winding banks, or rather precipices of Kentucke, and Dick's Rivers, de&s;erve the fir&s;t place. The a&s;toni&s;hed eye there beholds almo&s;t every where three or four hundred feet of a &s;o|lid perpendicular lime-&s;tone rock; in &s;ome parts a fine white marble, either curiou&s;ly arched, pil|lared or blocked up into fine building &s;tones. The&s;e precipices, as was ob&s;erved before, are like the &s;ides of a deep trench, or canal; the land a|bove being level, except where creeks &s;et in, and crowned with fine groves of red cedar. It is on|ly at particular places that this river can be cro&s;&s;|ed, one of which is worthy of admiration; a great road large enough for waggons made by buffaloes, &s;loping with an ea&s;y de&s;cent from the top to the bottom of a very large &s;teep hill, at or near the river above Lees-town.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="018467_0030_0FA7A7EF27646578">Caves are found in this country amazingly large; in &s;ome of which you may travel &s;everal miles under a fine lime&s;tone rock, &s;upported by curious arches and pillars: In mo&s;t of them runs a &s;tream of water.</P>

There is another &s;ulphureous &s;pring upon Four Mile Creek, a third upon Green River, and ma|ny others in different places, abounding with that u&s;eful mineral.</P>
<P>There are three &s;prings or ponds of bitumen near Green River, which do not form a &s;tream, but di&s;gorge them&s;elves into a common re&s;ervoir, and when u&s;ed in lamps an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of the fine&s;t oil.</P>

feet long, the ribs &s;even, and the thigh bones a|bout four; one of which is repo&s;ited in the libra|ry in Philadelphia, and &s;aid to weigh &s;eventy-eight pounds. The tu&s;ks are above a foot in length, the grinders about five inches &s;quare, and eight inches long. The&s;e bones have equally excited the amazement of the ignorant, and at|tracted the attention of the philo&s;opher.

What animal this is, and by what means its ru|ins are found in regions &s;o widely different, and where none &s;uch exi&s;ts at pre&s;ent, is a que&s;tion of more difficult deci&s;ion. The ignorant and &s;u|per&s;titious Tartars attribute them to a creature, whom they call Maimon, who, they &s;ay, u&s;ual|ly re&s;ides at the bottom of the rivers, and of whom they relate many marvellous &s;tories; but as this is an a&s;&s;ertion totally dive&s;ted of proof, and even of probability, it has ju&s;tly been reject|ed by the learned; and on the other hand it is certain, that no &s;uch amphibious quadruped ex|i&s;ts in our American waters.

The&s;e are difficulties &s;ufficient to &s;tagger credulity it&s;elf; and at length produced the enquiries of Dr. Hunter.

&s;uch &s;u&s;tenance, and his jaws totally unprovided with the teeth nece&s;&s;ary for its u&s;e: And from the whole he concluded to the &s;atisfaction of natura|li&s;ts, that the&s;e bones belonged to a quadruped now unknown, and who&s;e race is probably ex|tinct, unle&s;s it may be be found in the exten&s;ive continent of New Holland, who&s;e rece&s;&s;es have not yet been pervaded by the curio&s;ity or avidity of civilized man.

How formidable an enemy to the human &s;pecies, an animal as large as the elephant, the tyrant of the fore&s;ts, perhaps the devourer of man!

<HEAD>RIGHTS OF LAND.</HEAD>
<P>THE proprietors of the Kentucke lands ob|tain their patents from Virginia, and their rights are of three kinds, viz. Tho&s;e which ari&s;e from military &s;ervice, from &s;ettlement and pre-emp|tion, or from warrants from the trea&s;ury. The
<PB N="37" REF="018467_0036_0FA7A7F7659F5CE8">
military rights are held by officers, or their repre|&s;entatives, as a reward for &s;ervices done in one of the two la&s;t wars. The Settlement and pre-emp|tion rights ari&s;e from occupation. Every man who, before March, 1780, had remained in the country one year, or rai&s;ed a crop of corn, was allowed to have a &s;ettlement of four hundred a|cres, and a pre-emption adjoining it of one thou&s;and acres. Every man who had only built a cabbin, or made any improvement by him|&s;elf or others, was entitled to a pre-emption of one thou&s;and acres where &s;uch improvement was made.</P>
<P>In March, 1780, the &s;ettlement and pre-emption rights cea&s;ed, and trea&s;ury war|rants were afterwards i&s;&s;ued, authorizing their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to locate the quantity of land men|tioned in them, wherever it could be found vacant in Virginia.</P>
<P>The mode of procedure in the&s;e affairs may be in&s;tructive to the reader.

<P>The validity of the right of Virginia to this exten&s;ive we&s;tern territory has been di&s;puted by &s;ome, but without rea&s;on. The we&s;tern boun|dary of that &s;tate, by charter, re&s;tricted by the treaty of Paris, in 1763, is fixed upon the Ohio Ri|ver. She has purcha&s;ed the &s;oil from the Indi|ans, has fir&s;t &s;ettled it, and e&s;tabli&s;hed whole&s;ome laws for the regulation and government of the in|habitants; and therefore we conclude, that the right of Virginia to Kentucke is as permanent as the independence of America.</P>

<HEAD>TRADE OF KENTUCKE.</HEAD>
<P>A CONVENIENT &s;ituation for com|merce is the grand hinge upon which the popu|lation, riches and happine&s;s of every country greatly depends. I believe many conceive the &s;i|tuation of Kentucke to be unfavourable in this re&s;pect. I confe&s;s when I fir&s;t vi&s;ited this country I

was of the opinion of other mi&s;informed men, that the be&s;t channel was from Philadelphia or Baltimore, by the way of Pitt&s;burg&punc; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>From Philadelphia to Pitt&s;burg is a land-car|riage of</HI> 320 <HI>miles, from Baltimore</HI> 280.</NOTE> and from thence down the Ohio; and upon account of the difficulties and expences attending this route, for which there is no remedy, that goods would ever be dear. This opinion I have &s;ince reprobated, as the effect of ignorance of the trade up the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ippi from New Orleans, or Mantchac, at the river or gut Iberville.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are acquainted with America know the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi and Ohio rivers to be the key to the northern parts of the we&s;tern continent. The&s;e are the principal channels through which that exten&s;ive region, bathed by their waters, and enriched by the many &s;treams they receive, communicate with the &s;ea, and may truly be con|&s;idered as the great pa&s;&s;age made by the Hand of Nature for a variety of valuable purpo&s;es, and principally to promote the happine&s;s and benefit of mankind; among&s;t which, the conveyance of the produce of that immen&s;e and fertile country lying we&s;tward of the United States is not the lea&s;t. A &s;hort de&s;cription of the&s;e rivers, and &s;ome others flowing into them, are objects &s;ub|mitted to the reader's attention, in order to form
<PB N="40" REF="018467_0039_0FA7A7F9A3010B58">
a ju&s;t idea of the favourable commercial circum|&s;tances of that important country.</P>
<P>The Ohio river begins at Pitt&s;burg, 320 miles we&s;t of Philadelphia, being there formed by the junction of the Alleghany and Monangehela rivers, and running a winding cour&s;e of S. 60&deg; We&s;t, falls into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi 1074 miles, by the mean|ders of the river, below Pitt&s;burg. The only ob&s;truc|tion to navigation on this river are the Rapids, as de&s;cribed before under the de&s;cription of the Kentucke rivers; but they are pa&s;&s;ed in &s;afety when the &s;tream is high.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable branches compo&s;ing the head waters of Ohio are Red-&s;tone Creek, Cheat River, and Yochiaghany. The&s;e waters are na|vigable to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance above Pitt&s;burg, from November until June, and the Ohio a month longer; but from great Kenhawa, which is one hundred and ninety-&s;ix miles and a half be|low Pitt&s;burg, the &s;tream is navigable mo&s;t of the year. Down this river great quantities of goods are brought, and &s;ome are conveyed up the Ken|tucke rivers, others on hor&s;e-back or in waggons to the &s;ettled parts, and &s;old on an average at one hundred pounds per cent. advance.</P>
<P>The current of the Ohio de&s;cends about two miles an hour in autumn, and when the waters
<PB N="41" REF="018467_0040_0FA7A7FA63010388">
are high, about five miles. Tho&s;e of the Ken|tucke rivers are much the &s;ame, and without ra|pids, and are of immen&s;e value to the country, affording fi&s;h and fowl, and tran&s;portation of the produce of the country to the be&s;t market. The&s;e rivers increa&s;e the Ohio more in depth than breadth. At its mouth it is not more than one and a half mile in width, and enters the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi in a S. we&s;t direction with a &s;low cur|rent, and a fine channel. This great river, at the junction with the Ohio, runs in a S. ea&s;t di|rection, and afterwards in a S. we&s;t, having been a little before joined by a greater river called Mi&s;|&s;ouri,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Mi&s;&s;ouri is &s;uppo&s;ed to be about</HI> 3000 <HI>miles long.</HI></NOTE> which runs in an ea&s;tward direction through Loui&s;iana, and afterwards communicates to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi is &s;aid to be about</HI> 2500 <HI>miles long.</HI></NOTE> its own muddy and maje&s;|tic appearance. From the mouth of the Ohio to New Orleans, a di&s;tance not exceeding 460 miles in a &s;traight line, is about 856 by water. The depth is, in common, eight or ten fathoms until you approach its mouth, which empties it&s;elf by &s;e|veral channels into the gulf of Mexico. Here the navigation is dangerous, on account of the many i&s;lands, &s;and-bars and logs, inter&s;per&s;ed in its mouth, which is about twenty miles wide.
<PB N="42" REF="018467_0041_0FA7A7FB231C0598">
This di&s;advantage may be remedied almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner that the &s;tream was di&s;concerted. The conflict between the &s;ea and this mighty ri|ver, which brings down with its &s;tream great numbers of trees, mud, leaves, &amp;c. cau&s;es them to &s;ub&s;ide and form &s;hoals. One of the&s;e trees, &s;topped by its roots or branches, will &s;oon be join|ed by thou&s;ands more, and &s;o fixed, that no hu|man force is able to remove them. In time they are con&s;olidated, every flood adds another layer to their height, forming i&s;lands, which at length are covered with &s;hrubs, gra&s;s and cane, and for|cibly &s;hift the bed of the river. In this manner we &s;uppo&s;e mo&s;t of the country on each &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, below the Iberville, to have been formed, by i&s;lands uniting to i&s;lands, which in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time have greatly encroached on the &s;ea, and produced an exten&s;ive tract of country. If &s;ome of the floating timber at the mouths of this river were moved into &s;ome of the channels, numbers more would incorporate with them; and the current being impeded in the&s;e, the whole force of the river uniting, one important chan|nel would forceably be opened, and &s;ufficiently cleared, to admit of the mo&s;t excellent naviga|tion.</P>
<P>About ninety-nine miles above Orleans is a fort, now called Mantchac by the Spaniards; formerly Fort Bute by the Engli&s;h, who built it. Near this is
<PB N="43" REF="018467_0042_0FA7A7FBE6CA5BE0">
a large gut, formed by the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, called Iberville; &s;ome have dignified it with the name of River, when the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, its &s;ource, is high. This is navigable at mo&s;t not above four months in the year for the fir&s;t ten miles; for three miles further it is from two to &s;ix feet in autumn, and from two to four fathoms the remaining part of the way to lake Maurepas, receiving in its cour&s;e the river Amit, which is navigable for batteaux to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Lake Maurepas is about ten miles in length, and &s;even in breadth; and there is a pa&s;&s;age of &s;even miles between this and Lake Pontchar|train.</P>
<P>Lake Pontchartrain is about forty miles long, twenty-four broad, and eighteen feet deep. From this lake to the &s;ea the channel is ten miles long, and three hundred yards wide; and the water deep enough to admit large ve&s;&s;els through the&s;e lakes, and their communications. This place, if attended to, might be of con&s;equence to all the the we&s;tern country, and to the commerce of We&s;t-Florida: For it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;|ed, that the inhabitants and traders of the we&s;t|ern country would rather trade at this place than at New Orleans, if they could have as good re|turns for their peltry, and the produce of their &s;oil, as it makes a can&s;iderable difference in their
<PB N="44" REF="018467_0043_0FA7A7FD3B3DF460">
voyage, and &s;aves labour, money and time. Ex|perience will doubtle&s;s produce con&s;iderable im|provements, and render the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, either by the&s;e lakes, or New Orleans, nearly as cheap as any other. That the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ip|pi can an&s;wer every valuable purpo&s;e of trade and commerce is proved already to a demon&s;tration by experience.</P>
<P>I have rea&s;on to believe that the time is not far di&s;tant when New Orleans will be a great trading city, and perhaps another will be built near Mantchac, at Iberville, that may in time rival its glory.</P>
<P>A prodigious number of i&s;lands, &s;ome of which are of great extent, are inter&s;per&s;ed in that migh|ty river; and the difficulty in a&s;cending it in the Spring when the floods are high, is compen&s;ated by eddies or counter currents, which mo&s;tly run in the bends near the banks of the river with nearly equal velocity again&s;t the &s;tream, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the a&s;cending boats. This river is rapid in tho&s;e parts which have clu&s;ters of i&s;lands, &s;hoals and &s;and-banks; but the rapidity of the&s;e places will be no inconvenience to the newly invented me|chanical boats,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>This plan is now in agitation in Virginia, and recommended to government by two gentlemen of fir&s;t rate abilities, Mr. Charles Rum&s;ey and Doct. James M'Macken. Their propo&s;als are, "to con&s;truct a &s;pecies of boat, of the burthen of ten tons, that &s;hall &s;ail, or be propelled by the force of mechanical pow|ers thereto applied, up the &s;tream of a fre&s;h water river the di&s;tance of between</HI> 25 <HI>and</HI> 40 <HI>miles a day, notwith&s;tanding the velocity of the water &s;hould move at the rate of</HI> 10 <HI>miles an hour, to be wrought at no greater expence than that of three hands.</HI>"</NOTE> it being their peculiar property to &s;ail be&s;t in &s;mart currents.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="018467_0044_0FA7A800E23971B0">From New Orleans to the Falls of Ohio, bat|teaux, carrying about 40 tons, have been rowed by eighteen or twenty men in eight or ten weeks, which, at the extent, will not amount to more than five hundred pounds expence, which expe|rience has proved to be about one third of that from Philadelphia. It is highly probable that in time the di&s;tance will be exceedingly &s;hortened by cuting a-cro&s;s bends of the river.</P>
<P>Charlevoix relates, that at Coupee or Cut-point, the river formerly made a great turn, and &s;ome Canadians, by deepening the channel of a &s;mall brook, diverted the waters of the river into it, The impetuo&s;ity of the &s;tream was &s;o violent, and the &s;oil of &s;o rich and loo&s;e a quality, that in a &s;hort time the point was entirely cut through, and the old channel left dry, except in inunda|tions, by which travellers &s;ave 14 leagues of their
<PB N="46" REF="018467_0045_0FA7A6912B3E4060">
voyage. The new channel has been &s;ounded with a line of thirty fathoms without finding bottom. When the di&s;tance is &s;hortened, which I believe may readily be done, and the mechani|cal boats brought to their highe&s;t improvement, the expences of a voyage from New Orleans to the Falls of Ohio will be attended with incon|&s;iderable expence. Now we know by experience that forty tons of goods cannot be taken to the Falls of Ohio from Philadelphia under &s;ixteen hundred pounds expence; but by improve|ments on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, with the conveniences of the&s;e boats, goods can be brought from New Orle|ans to the Falls for the tenth part of that expence; and if they are &s;old at one hundred pounds per cent. now, when brought from Philadelphia at expences &s;o great, what may the merchant af|ford to &s;ell his goods at, who brings them &s;o much cheaper? Be&s;ides, the great advantages a|ri&s;ing from the exporting of peltry, and coun|try produce, which never can be conveyed to the ea&s;tern ports to any advantage. It is evident al|&s;o that the market from which they receive im|ports, mu&s;t con&s;equently receive their exports, which is the only return they can po&s;&s;ibly make.</P>
<P>By &s;tating the commerce of Kentucke in its proper terms, we find the expences &s;uch, that we conclude with propriety, that that country will
<PB N="47" REF="018467_0046_0FA7A68AE2B97EF0">
be &s;upplied with goods as cheap as if &s;ituated but forty miles from Philadelphia.</P>
<P>But perhaps it will be replied, New Orleans is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Spaniards, who, whenever they plea&s;e, may make u&s;e of that fort, and &s;ome others they have on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, to prevent the navigation, and ruin the trade. The pa&s;&s;age through Iberville is al&s;o &s;ubject to the Spaniards, and be&s;ides, inconvenient; that &s;tream continu|ing &s;o &s;hort a time, and in the mo&s;t di&s;advantage|ous &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>I grant it will be ab&s;urd to expect a free navi|gation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi whil&s;t the Spaniards are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New Orleans. To &s;uppo&s;e it, is an idea calculated to impo&s;e only upon the weak. They may perhaps trade with us upon their own terms, while they think it con&s;i&s;tent with their in|tere&s;t,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Article</HI> 8<HI>th of the late Definitive Treaty, &s;ays, The navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi River from its &s;ource to the ocean, &s;hall for ever remain free and open to the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain and the citizens of the United States.</HI></NOTE> but no friend&s;hip in trade exi&s;ts when in|tere&s;t expires; therefore, when the we&s;tern coun|try becomes populous and ripe for trade, &s;ound policy tells us the Floridas mu&s;t be ours too. Ac|cording to the articles of the Definitive Treaty, we are to have a free and unmole&s;ted navigation
<PB N="48" REF="018467_0047_0FA7A68BA4732958">
of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; but experience teaches man|kind that treaties are not always to be depended on, the mo&s;t &s;olemn being broken. Hence we learn that no one &s;hould put much faith in any &s;tate; and the trade and commerce of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi River cannot be &s;o well &s;ecured in any other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as our own.</P>
<P>Although the Iberville only admits of a &s;hort and inconvenient navigation, yet if a commercial town were built there, it would be the center of the we&s;tern trade; and a land carriage of ten or twelve miles would be counted no di&s;advantage to the merchant. Nay, I doubt not, that in time a canal will be broke through the gut of Iberville, which may divert the water of Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi that way, and render it a place of the greate&s;t con&s;e|quence in America; but this important period is re&s;erved for futurity.</P>

<HEAD> The ADVENTURES of Col. DA|NIEL BOON; containing a NARRA|TIVE of the WARS of Kentucke.</HEAD>
<P>CURIOSITY is natural to the &s;oul of man, and intere&s;ting objects have a power|ful influence on our affections. Let the&s;e influ|encing powers actuate, by the permi&s;&s;ion or di&s;po&s;al of Providence, from &s;elfi&s;h or &s;ocial views, yet in time the my&s;terious will of Heaven is un|folded, and we behold our conduct, from what|&s;oever motives excited, operating to an&s;wer the im|portant de&s;igns of heaven. Thus we behold Kentuc|ke, lately an howling wilderne&s;s, the habitation of &s;avages and wild bea&s;ts, become a fruitful field; this region, &s;o favourably di&s;tingui&s;hed by na|ture, now become the habitation of civilization,
<PB N="50" REF="018467_0049_0FA7A68D25273EE8">
at a period unparalleled in hi&s;tory, in the mid&s;t of a raging war, and under all the di&s;advantages of emigration to a country &s;o remote from the inhabited parts of the continent. Here, where the hand of violence &s;hed the blood of the inno|cent; where the horrid yells of &s;avages, and the groans of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, &s;ounded in our ears, we now hear the prai&s;es and adorations of our Creator; where wretched wigwams &s;tood, the mi|&s;erable abodes of &s;avages, we behold the founda|tions of cities laid, that, in all probability, will rival the glory of the greate&s;t upon earth. And we view Kentucke &s;ituated on the fertile banks of the great Ohio, ri&s;ing from ob&s;curity to &s;hine with &s;plendor, equal to any other of the &s;tars of the American hemi&s;phere.</P>
<P>The &s;ettling of this region well de&s;erves a place in hi&s;tory. Mo&s;t of the memorable events I have my&s;elf been exerci&s;ed in; and, for the &s;a|tisfaction of the public, will briefly relate the circum&s;tances of my adventures, and &s;cenes of life, from my fir&s;t movement to this country un|til this day.</P>
<P>It was on the fir&s;t of May, in the year 1769, that I re&s;igned my dome&s;tic happine&s;s for a time, and left my family and peaceable habitation on the Yadkin River, in North-Carolina, to wan|der through the wilderne&s;s of America, in que&s;t of
<PB N="51" REF="018467_0050_0FA7A68DE4798258">
the country of Kentucke, in company with John Finley, John Stewart, Jo&s;eph Holden, James Monay, and William Cool. We proceeded &s;uc|ce&s;sfully, and after a long and fatiguing journey through a mountainous wilderne&s;s, in a we&s;t|ward direction, on the &s;eventh day of June fol|lowing, we found our&s;elves on Red-River, where John Finley had for merly been trading with the Indians, and, from the top of an eminence, &s;aw with plea&s;ure the beautiful level of Kentuc|ke. Here let me ob&s;erve, that for &s;ome time we had experienced the mo&s;t uncomfortable wea|ther as a prelibation of our future &s;ufferings. At this place we encamped, and made a &s;helter to de|fend us from the inclement &s;ea&s;on, and began to hunt and reconnoitre the country. We found e|very where abundance of wild bea&s;ts of all &s;orts, through this va&s;t fore&s;t. The buffaloes were more frequent than I have &s;een cattle in the &s;et|tlements, browzing on the leaves of the cane, or croping the herbage on tho&s;e exten&s;ive plains, fear|le&s;s, becau&s;e ignorant, of the violence of man. Sometimes we &s;aw hundreds in a drove, and the numbers about the &s;alt &s;prings were amazing. In this fore&s;t, the habitation of bea&s;ts of every kind natural to America, we practi&s;ed hunting with great &s;ucce&s;s until the twenty-&s;econd day of December following.</P>
<P>This day John Stewart and I had a plea&s;ing
<PB N="52" REF="018467_0051_0FA7A68EA4C7D138">
ramble, but fortune changed the &s;cene in the clo&s;e of it. We had pa&s;&s;ed through a great fo|re&s;t, on which &s;tood myriads of trees, &s;ome gay with blo&s;&s;oms, others rich with fruits. Nature was here a &s;eries of wonders, and a fund of de|light. Here &s;he di&s;played her ingenuity and in|du&s;try in a variety of flowers and fruits, beauti|fully coloured, elegantly &s;haped, and charming|ly flavoured; and we were diverted with innu|merable animals pre&s;enting them&s;elves perpetual|ly to our view.&mdash;In the decline of the day, near Kentucke river, as we a&s;cended the brow of a &s;mall hill, a number of Indians ru&s;hed out of a thick cane-brake upon us, and made us pri&s;on|ers. The time of our &s;orrow was now arrived, and the &s;cene fully opened. The Indians plun|dered us of what we had, and kept us in confine|ment &s;even days, treating us with common &s;avage u&s;age. During this time we di&s;covered no un|ea&s;ine&s;s or de&s;ire to e&s;cape, which made them le&s;s &s;u&s;picious of us; but in the dead of night, as we lay in a thick cane-brake by a large fire, when &s;leep had locked up their &s;en&s;es, my &s;ituation not di&s;po&s;ing me for re&s;t, I touched my companion and gently awoke him. We improved this favoura|ble opportunity, and departed, leaving them to take their re&s;t, and &s;peedily directed our cour&s;e to|wards our old camp, but found it plundered; and the company di&s;per&s;ed and gone home. About this time
<PB N="53" REF="018467_0052_0FA7A691F0B669C8">
my brother, Squire Boon, with another adven|turer, who came to explore the country &s;hortly after us, was wandering through the fore&s;t, de|termined to find me, if po&s;&s;ible, and accidentally found our camp. Notwith&s;tanding the unfortu|nate circum&s;tances of our company, and our dan|gerous &s;ituation, as &s;urrounded with ho&s;tile &s;a|&s;avages, our meeting &s;o fortunately in the wilder|ne&s;s made us reciprocally &s;en&s;ible of the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction. So much does friend&s;hip triumph over misfortune, that &s;orrows and &s;ufferings va|ni&s;h at the meeting not only of real friends, but of the mo&s;t di&s;tant acquaintances, and &s;ub&s;titutes happine&s;s in their room.</P>
<P>Soon after this, my companion in captivity, John Stewart, was killed by the &s;avages, and the man that came with my brother returned home by him&s;elf. We were then in a dangerous, helple&s;s &s;ituation, expo&s;ed daily to perils and death among&s;t &s;avages and wild bea&s;ts, not a white man in the country but our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated, many hundred miles from our families in the howling wilderne&s;s, I believe few would have equally enjoyed the happine&s;s we ex|perienced. I often ob&s;erved to my brother, You &s;ee now how little nature requires to be &s;atisfied. Felicity, the companion of content, is rather found in our own brea&s;ts than in the enjoyment of external things: And I firmly believe it re|quires

but a little philo&s;ophy to make a man happy in what&s;oever &s;tate he is. This con&s;i&s;ts in a full re&s;ignation to the will of Providence; and a re&s;igned &s;oul finds plea&s;ure in a path &s;trew|ed with briars and thorns.</P>
<P>We continued not in a &s;tate of indolence, but hunted every day, and prepared a little cottage to defend us from the Winter &s;torms. We re|mained there undi&s;turbed during the Winter; and on the fir&s;t day of May, 1770, my brother returned home to the &s;ettlement by him&s;elf, for a new recruit of hor&s;es and ammunition, leav|ing me by my&s;elf, without bread, &s;alt or &s;ugar, without company of my fellow creatures, or e|ven a hor&s;e or dog. I confe&s;s I never before was under greater nece&s;&s;ity of exerci&s;ing philo&s;ophy and fortitude. A few days I pa&s;&s;ed uncomforta|bly. The idea of a beloved wife and family, and their anxiety upon the account of my ab&s;ence and expo&s;ed &s;ituation, made &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ions on my heart. A thou&s;and dreadful apprehen|&s;ions pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my view, and had undoubtedly di&s;po&s;ed me to melancholy, if further indulged.</P>
<P>One day I undertook a tour through the coun|try, and the diver&s;ity and beauties of nature I met with in this charming &s;ea&s;on, expelled every gloomy and vexatious thought. Ju&s;t at the clo&s;e

of day the gentle gales retired, and left the place to the di&s;po&s;al of a profound calm. Not a breeze &s;hook the mo&s;t tremulous leaf. I had gained the &s;ummit of a commanding ridge, and, looking round with a&s;toni&s;hing delight, beheld the ample plains, the beauteous tracts below. On the other hand, I &s;urveyed the famous river Ohio that rolled in &s;ilent dignity, marking the we&s;tern boundary of Kentucke with inconceivable grandeur. At a va&s;t di&s;tance I beheld the mountains lift their ve|nerable brows, and penetrate the clouds. All things were &s;till. I kindled a fire near a foun|tain of &s;weet water, and fea&s;ted on the loin of a buck, which a few hours before I had killed. The &s;ullen &s;hades of night &s;oon over&s;pread the whole hemi&s;phere, and the earth &s;eemed to ga&s;p after the hovering moi&s;ture. My roving excur|&s;ion this day had fatigued my body, and diverted my imagination. I laid me down to &s;leep, and I awoke not until the &s;un had cha&s;ed away the night. I continued this tour, and in a few days explored a con&s;iderable part of the country, each day equally plea&s;ed as the fir&s;t. I returned again to my old camp, which was not di&s;turbed in my ab&s;ence. I did not confine my lodging to it, but often repo&s;ed in thick cane-brakes, to a|void the &s;avages, who, I believe, often vi&s;ited my camp, but fortunately for me, in my ab&s;ence. In this &s;ituation I was con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to danger, and death. How unhappy &s;uch a &s;ituation for
<PB N="56" REF="018467_0055_0FA7A693E2DC5100">
a man tormented with fear, which is vain if no danger comes, and if it does, only augments the pain. It was my happine&s;s to be de&s;titute of this afflicting pa&s;&s;ion, with which I had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to be affected. The prowling wolves di|verted my nocturnal hours with perpetual howl|ings; and the various &s;pecies of animals in this va&s;t fore&s;t, in the daytime, were continually in my view.</P>
<P>Thus I was &s;urrounded with plenty in the mid&s;t of want. I was happy in the mid&s;t of dangers and inconveniences. In &s;uch a diver&s;ity it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to melancholy. No populous city, with all the varieties of commerce and &s;tately &s;tructures, could afford &s;o much plea|&s;ure to my mind, as the beauties of nature I found here.</P>
<P>Thus, through an uninterrupted &s;cene of &s;yl|van plea&s;ures, I &s;pent the time until the 27th day of July following, when my brother, to my great felicity, met me, according to appointment, at our old camp. Shortly after, we left this place, not thinking it &s;afe to &s;tay there longer, and pro|ceeded to Cumberland river, reconnoitring that part of the country until March, 1771, and giving names to the different waters.</P>
<P>Soon after, I returned home to my fami|ly with a determination to bring them as &s;oon as
<PB N="57" REF="018467_0056_0FA7A694A3C98790">
po&s;&s;ible to live in Kentucke, which I e&s;teemed a &s;econd paradi&s;e, at the ri&s;k of my life and for|tune.</P>
<P>I returned &s;afe to my old habitation, and found my family in happy circum&s;tances. I &s;old my farm on the Yadkin, and what goods we could not carry with us; and on the twenty-fifth day of September, 1773, bade a farewel to our friends, and proceeded on our journey to Kentucke, in company with five families more, and forty men that joined us in Powel's Valley, which is one hundred and fifty miles from the now &s;ettled parts of Kentucke. This promi&s;ing beginning was &s;oon overca&s;t with a cloud of adver&s;ity; for up|on the tenth day of October, the rear of our company was attacked by a number of Indians, who killed &s;ix, and wounded one man. Of the&s;e my elde&s;t &s;on was one that fell in the action. Though we defended our&s;elves, and repul&s;ed the enemy, yet this unhappy affair &s;cattered our cat|tle, brought us into extreme difficulty, and &s;o di&s;couraged the whole company, that we retreat|ed forty miles, to the &s;ettlement on Clench river. We had pa&s;&s;ed over two mountains, viz. Powel's and Walden's, and were approaching Cumberland mountain when this adver&s;e fortune overtook us. The&s;e mountains are in the wil|derne&s;s, as we pa&s;s from the old &s;ettlements in Virginia to Kentucke, are ranged in a S. we&s;t and
<PB N="58" REF="018467_0057_0FA7A6956560C578">
N. ea&s;t direction, are of a great length and breadth, and not far di&s;tant from each other. Over the&s;e, nature hath formed pa&s;&s;es, that are le&s;s difficult than might be expected from a view of &s;uch huge piles. The a&s;pect of the&s;e cliffs is &s;o wild and horrid, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to behold them without terror. The &s;pectator is apt to imagine that nature had formerly &s;uffered &s;ome violent convul&s;ion; and that the&s;e are the di&s;membered remains of the dreadful &s;hock; the ruins, not of Per&s;epolis or Palmyra, but of the world!</P>
<P>I remained with my family on Clench until the &s;ixth of June, 1774. when I and one Mi|chael Stoner were &s;olicited by Governor Dun|more, of Virginia, to go to the Falls of the Ohio, to conduct into the &s;ettlement a number of &s;ur|veyors that had been &s;ent thither by him &s;ome months before; this country having about this time drawn the attention of many adventurers. We immediately complied with the Governor's re|que&s;t, and conducted in the &s;urveyors, compleat|ing a tour of eight hundred miles, through ma|ny difficulties, in &s;ixty-two days.</P>
<P>Soon after I returned home, I was ordered to take the command of three garri&s;ons during the campaign, which Governor Dunmore carried on a|gain&s;t the Shawane&s;e Indians: After the conclu|&s;ion of which, the Militia was di&s;charged from
<PB N="59" REF="018467_0058_0FA7A69622003D28">
each garri&s;on, and I being relieved from my po&s;t, was &s;olicited by a number of North-Ca|rolina gentlemen, that were about purcha&s;ing the lands lying on the S. &s;ide of Kentucke River, from the Cherokee Indians, to attend their trea|ty at Wataga, in March, 1775, to negotiate with them, and, mention the boundaries of the purcha&s;e. This I accepted, and at the reque&s;t of the &s;ame gentlemen, undertook to mark-out a road in the be&s;t pa&s;&s;age from the &s;ettlement through the wilderne&s;s to Kentucke, with &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as I thought nece&s;&s;ary to employ for &s;uch an important undertaking.</P>
<P>I &s;oon began this work, having collected a num|ber of enterpri&s;ing men, well armed We pro|ceeded with all po&s;&s;ible expedition until we came within fifteen miles of where Boon&s;borough now &s;tands, and where we were fired upon by a party of Indians that killed two, and wounded two of our number; yet, although &s;urpri&s;ed and ta|ken at a di&s;advantage, we &s;tood our ground. This was on the twentieth of March, 1775. Three days after, we were fired upon again, and had two men killed, and three wounded. After|wards we proceeded on to Kentucke river with|out oppo&s;ition; and on the fir&s;t day of April be|gan to erect the fort of Boon&s;borough at a &s;alt lick, about &s;ixty yards from the river, on the S. &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="018467_0059_0FA7A698B5E8E358">On the fourth day, the Indians killed one of our men.&mdash;We were bu&s;ily employed in building this fort, until the fourteenth day of June following, without any farther oppo&s;ition from the Indians; and having fini&s;hed the works, I returned to my family, on Clench.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time, I proceeded to remove my family from Clench to this garri&s;on; where we ar|rived &s;afe without any other difficulties than &s;uch as are common to this pa&s;&s;age, my wife and daughter being the fir&s;t white women that ever &s;tood on the banks of Kentucke river.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth day of December fol|lowing we had one man killed, and one wound|ed, by the Indians, who &s;eemed determined to per&s;ecute us for erecting this fortification.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth day of July, 1776, two of Col. Calaway's daughters, and one of mine, were taken pri&s;oners near the fort. I immediately pur|&s;ued the Indians, with only eight men, and on the &s;ixteenth overtook them, killed two of the party, and recovered the girls. The &s;ame day on which this attempt was made, the Indians di|vided them&s;elves into different parties, and at|tacked &s;everal forts, which were &s;hortly before this time erected, doing a great deal of mi&s;chief. This was extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the new &s;ettlers. The
<PB N="61" REF="018467_0060_0FA7A699C8B14BC8">
innocent hu&s;bandman was &s;hot down, while bu|&s;y cultivating the &s;oil for his family's &s;upply. Mo&s;t of the cattle around the &s;tations were de|&s;troyed. They continued their ho&s;tilities in this manner until the fifteenth of April, 1777, when they attacked Boon&s;borough with a party of a|bove one hundred in number, killed one man, and wounded four.&mdash;Their lo&s;s in this attack was not certainly known to us.</P>
<P>On the fourth day of July following, a party of about two hundred Indians attacked Boon&s;|borough, killed one man, and wounded two. They be&s;ieged us forty-eight hours; during which time &s;even of them were killed, and at la&s;t, finding them&s;elves not likely to prevail, they rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and departed.</P>
<P>The Indians had di&s;po&s;ed their warriors in dif|ferent parties at this time, and attacked the dif|ferent garri&s;ons to prevent their a&s;&s;i&s;ting each other, and did much injury to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in|habitants.</P>
<P>On the nineteenth day of this month, Col. Logan's fort was be&s;ieged by a party of about two hundred Indians. During this dreadful &s;iege they did a great deal of mi&s;chief, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the garri&s;on, in which were only fifteen men, killed two, and wounded one. The enemies lo&s;s was
<PB N="62" REF="018467_0061_0FA7A699E2A20720">
uncertain, from the common practice which the Indians have of carrying off their dead in time of battle. Col. Harrod's fort was then defended by only &s;ixty-five men, and Boon&s;borough by twenty two, there being no more forts or white men in the country, except at the Falls, a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance from the&s;e, and all taken col|lectively, were but a handful to the numerous warriors that were every where di&s;per&s;ed through the country, intent upon doing all the mi&s;chief that &s;avage barbarity could invent. Thus we pa&s;&s;ed through a &s;cene of &s;ufferings that exceeds de&s;crip|tion.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fifth of this month a reinforce|ment of forty-five men arrived from North-Ca|rolina, and about the twentieth of Augu&s;t fol|lowing, Col. Bowman arrived with one hundred men from Virginia. Now we began to &s;trength|en, and from hence, for the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks, we had &s;kirmi&s;hes with Indians, in one quarter or other, almo&s;t every day.</P>
<P>The &s;avages now learned the &s;uperiority of the Long Knife, as they call the Virginians, by experience; being out-generalled in almo&s;t eve|ry battle. Our affairs began to wear a new a&s;|pect, and the enemy, not daring to venture on open war, practi&s;ed &s;ecret michief at times.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="018467_0062_0FA7A69AA2582510">On the fir&s;t day of January, 1778, I went with a party of thirty men to the Blue Licks, on Licking River, to make &s;alt for the different garri&s;ons in the country.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventh day of February, as I was hunt|ing, to procure meat for the company, I met with a party of one hundred and two Indians, and two Frenchmen, on their march again&s;t Boon&s;borough, that place being particularly the object of the enemy.</P>
<P>They pur&s;ued, and took me; and brought me on the eighth day to the Licks, where twenty &s;e|ven of my party were, three of them having previou&s;ly returned home with the &s;alt. I know|ing it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to e&s;cape, capitu|lated with the enemy, and, at a di&s;tance in their view, gave notice to my men of their &s;ituation, with orders not to re&s;i&s;t, but &s;urrender them|&s;elves captives.</P>
<P>The generous u&s;age the Indians had promi&s;ed before in my capitulation, was afterwards fully complied with, and we proceeded with them as pri|&s;oners to old Chelicothe, the principal Indian town, on Little Miami, where we arrived, after an uncomfortable journey, in very &s;evere weather, on the eighteenth day of February, and received as good treatment as pri&s;oners could expect from &s;a|vages.
<PB N="64" REF="018467_0063_0FA7A78CE5A78AA8">
&mdash;On the tenth day of March following, I, and ten of my men, were conducted by forty Indians to Detroit, where we arrived the thirtieth day, and were treated by Governor Hamilton, the Briti&s;h commander at that po&s;t, with great humanity.</P>
<P>During our travels, the Indians entertained me well; and their affection for me was &s;o great, that they utterly refu&s;ed to leave me there with the others, although the Governor offered them one hundred pounds Sterling for me, on purpo&s;e to give me a parole to go home. Several Engli&s;h gentlemen there, being &s;en&s;ible of my adver&s;e fortune, and touched with human &s;ympathy, ge|nerou&s;ly offered a friendly &s;upply for my wants, which I refu&s;ed, with many thanks for their kind|ne&s;s; adding, that I never expected it would be in my power to recompen&s;e &s;uch unmerited ge|nero&s;ity.</P>
<P>The Indians left my men in captivity with the Briti&s;h at Detroit, and on the tenth day of April brought me towards Old Chelicothe, where we arrived on the twenty-fifth day of the &s;ame month. This was a long and fatiguing march, through an exceeding fertile country, remarkable for fine &s;prings and &s;treams of water. At Che|licothe I &s;pent my time as comfortably as I could expect; was adopted, according to their cu&s;tom,
<PB N="65" REF="018467_0064_0FA7A78DA62E5290">
into a family where I became a &s;on, and had a great &s;hare in the affection of my new parents, brothers, &s;i&s;ters, and friends. I was exceedingly familiar and friendly with them, always appear|ing as chearful and &s;atisfied as po&s;&s;ible, and they put great confidence in me. I often went a hunt|ing with them, and frequently gained their ap|plau&s;e for my activity at our &s;hooting-matches. I was careful not to exceed many of them in &s;hooting; for no people are more envious than they in this &s;port. I could ob&s;erve, in their coun|tenances and ge&s;tures, the greate&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of joy when they exceeded me; and, when the re|ver&s;e happened, of envy. The Shawane&s;e king took great notice of me, and treated me with profound re&s;pect, and entire friend&s;hip, often en|tru&s;ting me to hunt at my liberty. I frequently returned with the &s;poils of the woods, and as often pre&s;ented &s;ome of what I had taken to him, expre&s;&s;ive of duty to my &s;overeign. My food and lodging was, in common, with them, not &s;o good indeed as I could de&s;ire, but nece&s;&s;i|ty made every thing acceptable.</P>
<P>I now began to meditate an e&s;cape, and care|fully avoided their &s;u&s;picions, continuing with them at Old Chelicothe until the fir&s;t day of June following, and then was taken by them to the &s;alt &s;prings on Sciotha, and kept there, mak|ing &s;alt, ten days. During this time I hunted
<PB N="66" REF="018467_0065_0FA7A78F5A9DF318">
&s;ome for them, and found the land, for a great extent about this river, to exceed the &s;oil of Ken|tucke, if po&s;&s;ible, and remarkably well watered.</P>
<P>When I returned to Chelicothe, alarmed to &s;ee four hundred and fifty Indians, of their choice&s;t warriors, painted and armed in a fearful man|ner, ready to march again&s;t Boon&s;borough, I de|termined to e&s;cape the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixteenth, before &s;un-ri&s;e, I departed in the mo&s;t &s;ecret manner, and arrived at Boon&s;bo|rough on the twentieth, after a journey of one hundred and &s;ixty miles; during which, I had but one meal.</P>
<P>I found our fortre&s;s in a bad &s;tate of defence, but we proceeded immediately to repair our flanks, &s;trengthen our gates and po&s;terns, and form double ba&s;tions, which we compleated in ten days. In this time we daily expected the ar|rival of the Indian army; and at length, one of my fellow pri&s;oners, e&s;caping from them, arrived, informing us that the enemy had an account of my departure, and po&s;tponed their expedition three weeks.&mdash;The Indians had &s;pies out viewing our movements, and were greatly alarmed with our increa&s;e in number and fortifications. The Grand Councils of the nations were held frequently, and with more deliberation than u&s;ual. They evi|dently

&s;aw the approaching hour when the Long Knife would di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of their de&s;irable ha|bitations; and anxiou&s;ly concerned for futurity, determined utterly to extirpate the whites out of Kentucke. We were not intimidated by their movements, but frequently gave them proofs of our courage.</P>
<P>About the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, I made an incur|&s;ion into the Indian country, with a party of nineteen men, in order to &s;urpri&s;e a &s;mall town up Sciotha, called Paint-Creek-Town. We ad|vanced within four miles thereof, where we met a party of thirty Indians, on their march again&s;t Boon&s;borough, intending to join the others from Chelicoth<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. A &s;mart fight en&s;ued betwixt us for &s;ome time: At length the &s;avages gave way, and fled. We had no lo&s;s on our &s;ide: The enemy had one killed, and two wounded. We took from them three hor&s;es, and all their baggage; and being informed, by two of our number that went to their town, that the Indians had entirely evacuated it, we proceeded no further, and re|turned with all po&s;&s;ible expedition to a&s;&s;i&s;t our garri&s;on again&s;t the other party. We pa&s;&s;ed by them on the &s;ixth day, and on the &s;eventh, we arrived &s;afe at Boon&s;borough.</P>
<P>On the eighth, the Indian army arrived, being four hundred and forty-four in number, commanded
<PB N="68" REF="018467_0067_0FA7A793A3C49208">
by Capt. Duque&s;ne, eleven other Frenchmen, and &s;ome of their own chiefs, and marched up with|in view of our fort, with Briti&s;h and French co|lours flying; and having &s;ent a &s;ummons to me, in his Britannick Maje&s;ty's name, to &s;urrender the fort, I reque&s;ted two days con&s;ideration, which was granted.</P>
<P>It was now a critical period with us.&mdash;We were a &s;mall number in the garri&s;on:&mdash;A powerful ar|my before our walls, who&s;e appearance proclaim|ed inevitable death, fearfully painted, and mark|ing their foot&s;teps with de&s;olation. Death was preferable to captivity; and if taken by &s;torm, we mu&s;t inevitably be devoted to de&s;truction. In this &s;ituation we concluded to maintain our garri&s;on, if po&s;&s;ible. We immediately proceeded to collect what we could of our hor&s;es, and other cattle, and bring them through the po&s;terns into the fort: And in the evening of the ninth, I re|turned an&s;wer, that we were determined to de|fend our fort while a man was living &mdash;Now, &s;aid I to their commander, who &s;tood attentive|ly hearing my &s;entiments, We laugh at all your formidable preparations: But thank you for giv|ing us notice and time to provide for our defence. Your efforts will not prevail; for our gates &s;hall for ever deny you admittance.&mdash;Whether this an&s;wer affected their courage, or not, I cannot tell; but contrary to our expectations, they
<PB N="69" REF="018467_0068_0FA7A794680145A0">
formed a &s;cheme to deceive us, declaring it was their orders, from Governor Hamilton, to take us captives, and not to de&s;troy us; but if nine of us would come out, and treat with them, they would immediatly withdraw their forces from our walls, and return home peaceably. This &s;ound|ed grateful in our ears; and we agreed to the propo&s;al.</P>
<P>We held the treaty within &s;ixty yards of the garri&s;on, on purpo&s;e to divert them from a breach of honour, as we could not avoid &s;u&s;picions of the &s;avages. In this &s;ituation the articles were formally agreed to, and &s;igned; and the Indians told us it was cu&s;tomary with them, on &s;uch occa|&s;ions, for two Indians to &s;hake hands with every white-man in the treaty, as an evidence of en|tire friend&s;hip. We agreed to this al&s;o, but were &s;oon convinced their policy was to take us pri|&s;oners.&mdash;They immediately grappled us; but, although &s;urrounded by hundreds of &s;avages, we extricated our&s;elves from them, and e&s;caped all &s;afe into the garri&s;on, except one that was wounded, through a heavy fire from their army. They immediately attacked us on every &s;ide, and a con&s;tant heavy fire en&s;ued between us day and night for the &s;pace of nine days.</P>
<P>In this time the enemy began to undermine our fort, which was &s;ituated &s;ixty yards from Ken|tucke

river. They began at the water-mark, and pro|ceeded in the bank &s;ome di&s;tance, which we un|der&s;tood by their making the water muddy with the clay; and we immediately proceeded to di&s;|appoint their de&s;ign, by cutting a trench a-cro&s;s their &s;ubterranean pa&s;&s;age. The enemy di&s;cover|ing our counter-mine, by the clay we threw out of the fort, de&s;i&s;ted from that &s;tratagem: And ex|perience now fully convincing them that neither their power nor policy could effect their purpo&s;e, on the twentieth day of Augu&s;t they rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and departed.</P>
<P>During this dreadful &s;iege, which threatened death in every form, we had two men killed, and four wounded, be&s;ides a number of cattle. We killed of the enemy thirty-&s;even, and wounded a great number. After they were gone, we pick|ed up one hundred and twenty-five pounds weight of bullets, be&s;ides what &s;tuck in the logs of our fort; which certainly is a great proof of their indu&s;try. Soon after this, I went into the &s;ettlement, and nothing worthy of a place in this account pa&s;&s;ed in my affairs for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>During my ab&s;ence from Kentucke, Col. Bow|man carried on an expedition again&s;t the Shawane&s;e, at Old Chelicothe, with one hundred and &s;ixty men, in July, 1779. Here they arrived undi&s;|covered, and a battle en&s;ued, which la&s;ted un|til
<PB N="71" REF="018467_0070_0FA7A795E895E480">
ten o'clock, A. M. when Col. Bowman, find|ing he could not &s;ucceed at this time, retreated a|bout thirty miles. The Indians, in the mean time, collecting all their forces, pur&s;ued and o|vertook him, when a &s;mart fight continued near two hours, not to the advantage of Col. Bow|man's party.</P>
<P>Col. Harrod propo&s;ed to mount a number of hor&s;e, and furiou&s;ly to ru&s;h upon the &s;avages, who at this time fought with remarkable fury. This de&s;perate &s;tep had a happy effect, broke their line of battle, and the &s;avages fled on all &s;ides. In the&s;e two battles we had nine killed, and one wounded. The enemy's lo&s;s uncertain, on|ly two &s;calps being taken.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;econd day of June, 1780, a large party of Indians and Canadians, about &s;ix hundred in number, commanded by Col. Bird, attacked Riddle's and Martin's &s;tations, at the Forks of Licking River, with &s;ix pieces of ar|tillery. They carried this expedition &s;o &s;ecretly, that the unwary inhabitants did not di&s;cover them, until they fired upon the forts; and, not being prepared to oppo&s;e them, were obliged to &s;urrender them&s;elves mi&s;erable captives to barba|rous &s;avages, who immediately after tomahawked one man and two women, and loaded all the others with heavy baggage, forcing them along
<PB N="72" REF="018467_0071_0FA7A796A37F8640">
toward their towns, able or unable to march. Such as were weak and faint by the way, they tomahawked. The tender women, and helple&s;s children, fell victims to their cruelty. This, and the &s;avage treatment they received afterwards, is &s;hocking to humanity, and too barbarous to relate.</P>
<P>The ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;avages, and their allies, cau&s;ed General Clark, the commandant at the Falls of the Ohio, immediately to begin an expedition with his own regiment, and the arm|ed force of the country, again&s;t Pecaway, the principal town of the Shawane&s;e, on a branch of Great Miami, which he fini&s;hed with great &s;uc|ce&s;s, took &s;eventeen &s;calps, and burnt the town to a&s;hes, with the lo&s;s of &s;eventeen men.</P>
<P>About this time I returned to Kentucke with my family; and here, to avoid an enquiry into my conduct, the reader being before informed of my bringing my family to Kentucke, I am under the nece&s;&s;ity of informing him that, during my captivity with the Indians, my wife, who de|&s;paired of ever &s;eeing me again, expecting the In|dians had put a period to my life, oppre&s;&s;ed with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the country, and bereaved of me, her only happine&s;s, had, before I returned, tran&s;|ported my family and goods, on hor&s;es, through the wilderne&s;s, amid&s;t a multitude of dangers, to her father's hou&s;e, in North-Carolina.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="018467_0072_0FA7A7985F201BF0">Shortly after the troubles at Boon&s;borough, I went to them, and lived peaceably there until this time. The hi&s;tory of my going home, and re|turning with my family, forms a &s;eries of diffi|culties, an account of which would &s;well a vo|lume, and being foreign to my purpo&s;e, I &s;hall purpo&s;ely omit them.</P>
<P>I &s;ettled my family in Boon&s;borough once more; and &s;hortly after, on the &s;ixth day of October, 1780, I went in company with my brother to the Blue Licks; and, on our return home, we were fired upon by a party of Indians. They &s;hot him, and pur&s;ued me, by the &s;cent of their dog, three miles; but I killed the dog, and e&s;caped. The Winter &s;oon came on, and was very &s;evere, which confined the Indians to their wigwams.</P>
<P>The &s;everity of this Winter cau&s;ed great diffi|culties in Kentucke. The enemy had de&s;troyed mo&s;t of the corn, the Summer before. This ne|ce&s;&s;ary article was &s;carce, and dear; and the inhabitants lived chiefly on the fle&s;h of buffaloes. The circum&s;tances of many were very lamenta|ble: However, being a hardy race of people, and accu&s;tomed to difficulties and nece&s;&s;ities, they were wonderfully &s;upported through all their &s;uf|ferings, until the en&s;uing Fall, when we receiv|ed abundance from the fertile &s;oil.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="018467_0073_0FA7A79BF4936190">Towards Spring, we were frequently hara&s;&s;ed by Indians; and, in May, 1782, a party a&s;&s;aulted A&s;hton's &s;tation, killed one man, and took a Negro pri&s;oner. Capt. A&s;hton, with twenty-five men, pur&s;ued, and overtook the &s;avages, and a &s;mart fight en&s;ued, which la&s;ted two hours; but they being &s;uperior in number, obliged Captain A&s;hton's party to retreat, with the lo&s;s of eight killed, and four mortally wounded; their brave commander him&s;elf being numbered among the dead.</P>
<P>The Indians continued their ho&s;tilities; and, about the tenth of Augu&s;t following, two boys were taken from Major Hoy's &s;tation. This party was pur&s;ued by Capt. Holder and &s;eventeen men, who were al&s;o defeated, with the lo&s;s of four men killed, and one wounded. Our affairs became more and more alarming. Several &s;tations which had lately been erected in the country were conti|nually infe&s;ted with &s;avages, &s;tealing their hor&s;es and killing the men at every opportunity. In a field, near Lexington, an Indian &s;hot a man, and running to &s;calp him, was him&s;elf &s;hot from the fort, and fell dead upon his enemy.</P>
<P>Every day we experienced recent mi&s;chiefs. The barbarous &s;avage nations of Shawane&s;e, Che|rokees, Wyandots, Tawas, Delawares, and &s;e|veral others near Detroit, united in a war again&s;t
<PB N="75" REF="018467_0074_0FA7A79CA335C758">
us, and a&s;&s;embled their choice&s;t warriors at old Chelicothe, to go on the expedition, in order to de&s;troy us, and entirely depopulate the country. Their &s;avage minds were inflamed to mi&s;chief by two abandoned men, Captains M'Kee and Girty. The&s;e led them to execute every diaboli|cal &s;cheme; and, on the fifteenth day of Augu&s;t, commanded a party of Indians and Canadians, of about five hundred in number, again&s;t Bri|ant's &s;tation, five miles from Lexington. With|out demanding a &s;urrender, they furiou&s;ly a&s;|&s;aulted the garri&s;on, which was happily prepared to oppo&s;e them; and, after they had expended much ammunition in vain, and killed the cattle round the fort, not being likely to make them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of this place, they rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and departed in the morning of the third day af|ter they came, with the lo&s;s of about thirty kill|ed, and the number of wounded uncertain.&mdash;Of the garri&s;on four were killed, and three wound|ed.</P>
<P>On the eighteenth day Col. Todd, Col. Trigg, Major Harland, and my&s;elf, &s;peedily collected one hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix men, well armed, and pur&s;ued the &s;avages. They had marched be|yond the Blue Licks to a remarkable bend of the main fork of Licking River, about forty-three miles from Lexington, as it is particularly repre|&s;ented in the map, where we overtook them on
<PB N="76" REF="018467_0075_0FA7A79D6776DFF0">
the nineteenth day. The &s;avages ob&s;erving us, gave way; and we, being ignorant of their num|bers, pa&s;&s;ed the river. When the enemy &s;aw our proceedings, having greatly the advantage of us in &s;ituation, they formed the line of battle, as repre&s;ented in the map, from one bend of Lick|ing to the other, about a mile from the Blue <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ks. An exceeding fierce battle immediately began, for about fifteen minutes, when we, be|ing over-powered by numbers, were obliged to re|treat, with the lo&s;s of &s;ixty-&s;even men; &s;even of whom were taken pri&s;oners The brave and much lamented Colonels Todd and Trigg, Major Harland and my &s;econd &s;on, were among the dead. We were informed that the Indians, numbering their dead, found they had four killed more than we; and therefore, four of the pri&s;oners they had taken, were, by general con&s;ent, ordered to be killed, in a mo&s;t barbarous manner, by the young warriors, in order to train them up to cruelty; and then they proceeded to their towns.</P>
<P>On our retreat we were met by Col. Logan, ha&s;tening to join us, with a number of well arm|ed men. This powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance we unfortu|nately wanted in the battle; for, notwith&s;tanding the enemy's &s;uperiority of numbers, they ac|knowledged that, if they had received one more fire from us, they &s;hould undoubtedly have giv|en way. So valiantly did our &s;mall party fight,
<PB N="77" REF="018467_0076_0FA7A79E2424C308">
that, to the memory of tho&s;e who unfortunate|ly fell in the battle, enough of honour cannot be paid. Had Col. Logan and his party been with us, it is highly probable we &s;hould have given the &s;avages a total defeat.</P>
<P>I cannot reflect upon this dreadful &s;cene, but &s;orrow fills my heart. A zeal for the defence of their country led the&s;e heroes to the &s;cene of ac|tion, though with a few men to attack a power|ful army of experienced warriors. When we gave way, they pur&s;ued us with the utmo&s;t ea|gerne&s;s, and in every quarter &s;pread de&s;truction. The river was difficult to cro&s;s, and many were killed in the flight, &s;ome ju&s;t entering the river, &s;ome in the water, others after cro&s;&s;ing in a&s;cend|ing the cliffs. Some e&s;caped on hor&s;e-back, a few on foot; and, being di&s;per&s;ed every where, in a few hours, brought the melancholy news of this unfortunate battle to Lexington. Many wi|dows were now made. The reader may gue&s;s what &s;orrow filled the hearts of the inhabitants, exceeding any thing that I am able to de&s;cribe. Being reinforced, we returned to bury the dead, and found their bodies &s;trewed every where, cut and mangled in a dreadful manner. This mourn|ful &s;cene exhibited a horror almo&s;t unparalleled: Some torn and eaten by wild bea&s;ts; tho&s;e in the river eaten by fi&s;hes; all in &s;uch a putrified con|dition,
<PB N="78" REF="018467_0077_0FA7A79EE6A3E050">
that no one could be di&s;tingui&s;hed from another.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as General Clark, then at the Falls of the Ohio, who was ever our ready friend, and merits the love and gratitude of all his coun|try-men, under&s;tood the circum&s;tances of this unfortunate action, he ordered an expedition, with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, to pur&s;ue the &s;avages, which was &s;o expeditiou&s;ly effected, that we overtook them within two miles of their towns, and pro|bably might have obtained a great victory, had not two of their number met us about two hun|dred poles before we come up. The&s;e returned quick as lightening to their camp with the alarm|ing news of a mighty army in view. The &s;a|vages fled in the utmo&s;t di&s;order, evacuated their towns, and reluctantly left their territory to our mercy. We immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Old Chelicothe without oppo&s;ition, being de&s;erted by its inhabitants. We continued our pur&s;uit through five towns on the Miami rivers, Old Chelicothe, Pecaway, New Chelicothe, Will's Towns, and Chelicothe, burnt them all to a&s;h|es, entirely de&s;troyed their corn, and other fruits, and every where &s;pread a &s;cene of de&s;olation in the country. In this expedition we took &s;even pri&s;oners and five &s;calps, with the lo&s;s of only four men, two of whom were accidentally killed by our own army.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="018467_0078_0FA7A79FA60E4F40">This campaign in &s;ome mea&s;ure damped the &s;pirits of the Indians, and made them &s;en&s;ible of our &s;uperiority. Their connections were di&s;&s;olv|ed, their armies &s;cattered, and a future inva&s;ion put entirely out of their power; yet they conti|nued to practi&s;e mi&s;chief &s;ecretly upon the inha|bitants, in the expo&s;ed parts of the country.</P>
<P>In October following, a party made an ex|cur&s;ion into that di&s;trict called the Crab Orchard, and one of them, being advanced &s;ome di&s;tance before the others, boldly entered the hou&s;e of a poor defencele&s;s family, in which was only a Ne|gro man, a woman and her children, terrified with the apprehen&s;ions of immediate death. The &s;avage, perceiving their defencele&s;s &s;ituation, with|out offering violence to the family attempted to captivate the Negro, who, happily proved an o|ver-match for him, threw him on the ground, and, in the &s;truggle, the mother of the children drew an ax from a corner of the cottage, and cut his head off, while her little daughter &s;hut the door. The &s;avages in&s;tantly appeared, and ap|plied their tomahawks to the door. An old ru&s;|ty gun-barrel, without a lock, lay in a corner, which the mother put through a &s;mall crevice, and the &s;avages, perceiving it, fled. In the mean time, the alarm &s;pread through the neighbour|hood; the armed men collected immediately, and pur&s;ued the ravagers into the wilderne&s;s. Thus
<PB N="80" REF="018467_0079_0FA7A7A065572888">
Providence, by the means of this Negro, &s;aved the whole of the poor family from de&s;truction. From that time, until the happy return of peace between the United States and Great-Britain, the Indians did us no mi&s;chief. Finding the great king beyond the water di&s;appointed in his ex|pectations, and con&s;cious of the importance of the Long Knife, and their own wretchedne&s;s, &s;ome of the nations immediately de&s;ired peace; to which, at pre&s;ent, they &s;eem univer&s;ally di&s;|po&s;ed, and are &s;ending amba&s;&s;adors to General Clark, at the Falls of the Ohio, with the mi|nutes of their Councils; a &s;pecimen of which, in the minutes of the Pianka&s;haw Council, is &s;ubjoined.</P>
<P>To conclude, I can now &s;ay that I have veri|fied the &s;aying of an old Indian who &s;igned Col. Hender&s;on's deed. Taking me by the hand, at the delivery thereof, Brother, &s;ays he, we have given you a fine land, but I believe you will have much trouble in &s;ettling it.&mdash;My foot&s;teps have often been marked with blood, and therefore I can truly &s;ub&s;cribe to its original name. Two darling &s;ons, and a brother, have I lo&s;t by &s;avage hands, which have al&s;o taken from me forty va|luable hor&s;es, and abundance of cattle. Many dark and &s;leeple&s;s nights have I been a compa|nion for owls, &s;eparated from the chearful &s;oci|ety of men, &s;corched by the Summer's &s;un, and
<PB N="81" REF="018467_0080_0FA7A7A36B534730">
pinched by the Winter's cold, an in&s;trument or|dained to &s;ettle the wilderne&s;s. But now the &s;cene is changed: Peace crowns the &s;ylvan &s;hade.</P>
<P>What thanks, what ardent and cea&s;ele&s;s thanks are due to that all-&s;uperintending Providence which has turned a cruel war into peace, brought order out of confu&s;ion, made the fierce &s;avages placid, and turned away their ho&s;tile weapons from our country! May the &s;ame Almighty Goodne&s;s bani&s;h the accur&s;ed mon&s;ter, war, from all lands, with her hated a&s;&s;ociates, rapine and in&s;atiable ambition. Let peace, de&s;cending from her native heaven, bid her olives &s;pring a|mid&s;t the joyful nations; and plenty, in league with commerce, &s;catter ble&s;&s;ings from her copi|ous hand.</P>
<P>This account of my adventures will inform the reader of the mo&s;t remarkable events of this country.&mdash;I now live in peace and &s;afety, enjoy|ing the &s;weets of liberty, and the bounties of Providence, with my once fellow-&s;ufferers, in this delightful country, which I have &s;een pur|cha&s;ed with a va&s;t expence of blood and trea&s;ure, delighting in the pro&s;pect of its being, in a &s;hort time, one of the mo&s;t opulent and powerful &s;tates on the continent of North-America; which, with the love and gratitude of my country-men,

<P>WHAT I have often told you, is now come to pa&s;s. This day I received news from my Great Chief, at the Falls of Ohio. Peace is made with the enemies of America. The White Fle&s;h, the Americans, French, Spa|niards, Dutch and Engli&s;h, this day &s;moke out

<P><HI>My Children on Waba&s;h,</HI></P>
<P>Open your ears, and let what I tell you &s;ink deep in your hearts. You know me. Near twen|ty years I have been among you. The Long Knife is my nation. I know their hearts; peace they carry in one hand, and war in the other.</P>
<P>I leave you to your&s;elves to judge. Con&s;ider, and now accept the one, or the other. We ne|ver beg peace of our enemies. If you love your women and children, receive the belt of wampum I pre&s;ent you. Return me my fle&s;h you have in your villages, and the hor&s;es you &s;tole from my people at Kentucks.

<HEAD>OF THE INDIANS.</HEAD>
<P>WE have an account of twenty-eight dif|ferent nations of Indians, Ea&s;tward of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.&mdash;Their &s;ituation is as follows.</P>
<P>The Cherokee Indians are neare&s;t to Ken|tucke, living upon the Tene&s;e River, near the mouths of Clench, Hol&s;tein, Nolachucke, and French-Broad Rivers, which form the Te|ne&s;e or Cherokee River, in the interior parts of North-Carolina, two hundred miles from Ken|tucke.</P>
<P>The Chicamawgees live about ninety miles down the Tene&s;e from the Cherokees, at a place called Chicamawgee, which in our language &s;igni|fies a Boiling Pot, there being a whirl-pool in the river dangerous for boats. The Dragomo|nough, a Chief of the Cherokees, with &s;ixty more, broke off from that nation, and formed this
<PB N="88" REF="018467_0087_0FA7A7A8A988F710">
tribe, which is called by the name of the Whirl|pool.</P>
<P>The Cheegees, and Middle-Settlement Indi|ans, are &s;ettled about fifty and eighty miles South of the Cherokees.&mdash;The&s;e four tribes &s;peak one language, being de&s;cended from the Cherokees.</P>
<P>The Chica&s;aws inhabit about one hundred miles N. W. from our &s;ettlement at French Lick, on Cumberland River, on the heads of a river called Tombeche, which runs into Mobile Bay.</P>
<P>The Choctaw nation are eighty miles from the Chica&s;aws, down the &s;ame river.</P>
<P>The Creek Indians live about one hundred and &s;ixty miles South of the Choctaws, on the Apa|lache River, which runs into the Gulph of Mex|ico, &s;ome little di&s;tance Ea&s;t of Mobile Bay.</P>
<P>The Uchees Indians occupy four different places of re&s;idence, at the head of St. John's, the Fork of St. Mary's, the head of Cannuchee, and the head of St. Tillis. The&s;e rivers ri&s;e on the borders of Georgia, and run &s;eparately into the ocean.</P>
<P>The Catauba Indians are &s;ettled in North-Ca|rolina,
<PB N="89" REF="018467_0088_0FA7A7A9664E3A88">
about two hundred miles di&s;tant from Charles-town, in S. Carolina.</P>
<P>The tribes to the We&s;tward of Ohio River are the Delawares&punc; living upon the Mi&s;kingum Ri|ver, which runs into the Ohio one hundred and eighty-&s;even miles above Sciotha, on the N. We&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P>The Mingo Nation lives upon a N. W. branch of Sciotha River, as is repre&s;ented in the map.</P>
<P>The Wyandotts po&s;&s;e&s;s the banks of a river call|ed Sandu&s;ky, which heads and interlocks with Sciotha, and, running in a contrary direction nearly N. W. for a great di&s;tance, falls into Lake Erie.</P>
<P>The Six Nations are &s;ettled upon waters run|ning into Lake Ontario, that head in the moun|tain, from whence the Ohio and Su&s;quehannah rivers ri&s;e.</P>
<P>The Shawane&s;e Indians occupy five towns on the waters of Little and Great Miami, as appears in the map.</P>
<P>The Gibbaways are fixed on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of Detroit River, and oppo&s;ite the fort of that name&punc; This river runs out of Lake Huron

into Lake Erie, is thirty-&s;ix miles in length, and the fort &s;tands on the We&s;t &s;ide, half way be|twixt the&s;e lakes.</P>
<P>The Hurons live &s;ix miles from the Gib|baways, towards Lake Huron, and on the &s;ame &s;ide of the river.</P>
<P>The Tawaws are found eighteen miles up the Mawmee or Omee River, which runs into Lake Erie.</P>
<P>There is a &s;mall tribe of Tawas &s;ettled at a place called the Rapids, &s;ome di&s;tance higher up the river than the former.</P>
<P>The Mawmee Indians live two hundred and forty miles up this river, at a place called Ro|&s;edebeau.</P>
<P>The Pianka&s;haws re&s;ide about one hundred and &s;ixty miles up Waba&s;h River:&mdash;</P>

many &s;y&s;tems to account for the population of this immen&s;e continent. There is &s;carce a people in the old world which has not had its advocates; and there have not been wanting &s;ome, who&punc; de&s;pairing to loo&s;en, have cut the knot, by &s;uppo&s;ing that the power, which fur|ni&s;hed America with plants, has in the &s;ame manner &s;upplied it with men, or at lea&s;t, that a remnant in this continent was &s;aved from the univer&s;al deluge, as well as in the other. As this &s;ubject is rather curious than u&s;eful, and, in its very nature, does not admit of certainty, every thing that pa&s;&s;ed in America before the arrival of the Europeans being plunged in Cimmerian darkne&s;s, except tho&s;e little traditional records, which diffu&s;e a glimmering light on the two empires of Mex|ico and Peru, for about two hundred years at mo&s;t before that period, we &s;hall only &s;lightly touch on that &s;ubject; chiefly for the &s;ake of taking notice of &s;ome modern di&s;coveries which &s;eem to &s;trengthen the probability of &s;ome for|mer theories.

The immen&s;e &s;eas, which &s;eparate the
<PB N="93" REF="018467_0092_0FA7A7B029DFB230">
two continents on every other &s;ide, render it high|ly improbable that any colonies could ever have been &s;ent a-cro&s;s them before the di&s;covery of the magnetical compa&s;s. The ingenious M. Buffon too has remarked, and the ob&s;ervation appears to be ju&s;t, that there are no animals inhabiting in common the two continents, but &s;uch as can bear the colds of the North. Thus there are no ele|phants, no lions, no tigers, no camels in Ame|rica; but bears, wolves, deer, and elks in abun|dance, ab&s;olutely the &s;ame in both hemi&s;pheres. This hypothe&s;is, which has been gaining ground ever &s;ince its fir&s;t appearance in the world, is now reduced almo&s;t to a certainty by the late di&s;|coveries of Capt. Cook. That illu&s;trious, but unfortunate navigator, in his la&s;t voyage, pene|trated for a con&s;iderable di&s;tance into the &s;trait which divides A&s;ia from America, which is only &s;ix leagues wide at its mouth; and therefore ea&s;i|ly practicable for canoes. We may now there|fore conclude, that no farther enquiry will ever be made in to the general origin of the American tribes.</P>
<P>Yet, after all, it is far from being improbable that various nations, by &s;hipwreck, or otherwi&s;e, may have contributed, in &s;ome degree, to the popula|tion of this continent. The Carthaginians, who had many &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Africa, be|yond the Straits of Gibraltar, and pu&s;hed their di&s;coveries as far as where the two continents in

that quarter approach each other the neare&s;t, may probably have been thrown by tempe&s;ts on the American coa&s;t, and the companies of the ve&s;&s;els finding it impracticable to return, may have in|corporated with the former inhabitants, or have formed new &s;ettlements, which, from want of the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truments to exerci&s;e the arts they were acquainted with, would naturally degene|rate into barbarity. There are indeed &s;ome an|cient writers, who give us rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that there were colonies regularly formed by that na|tion in America, and that the communication, after having continued for &s;ome time, was &s;top|ped by order of the State. But it is difficult to conceive that any people, e&s;tabli&s;hed with all tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries proper for their &s;ituation, &s;hould ever degenerate, from &s;o high a degree of cultivation as the Carthaginians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to a total igno|rance even of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary arts: And there|fore it &s;eems probable, that if that nation ever had &s;uch colonies, they mu&s;t have been out off by the natives, and every ve&s;tige of them de|&s;troyed.</P>
<P>About the ninth and tenth centuries, the Danes were the greate&s;t navigators in the univer&s;e. They di&s;covered and &s;ettled Iceland; and from thence, in 964, planted a colony in Greenland. The ancient Icelandic chronicles, as reported by M. Mallet, contain an account of &s;ome Icelanders,
<PB N="95" REF="018467_0094_0FA7A7B1A89AB2F8">
who, in the clo&s;e of an un&s;ucce&s;sful war, fled to Greenland, and from thence We&s;tward, to a country covered with vines, which from thence they called Vinland.</P>
<P>The adventurers returned home, and conduct|ed a colony to their new di&s;covery; but di&s;turb|ances ari&s;ing in Denmark, all communication with Greenland, as well as Vinland, cea&s;ed; and tho&s;e countries remained unknown to the re&s;t of the world for &s;everal ages. The remains of this colony are probably to be found on the coa&s;t of Labrador, in the nation of the E&s;quimaux. The colour of their &s;kins, their hairy bodies and bu&s;hy beards, not to mention the difference of manners, mark an origin totally di&s;tinct from that of the other Indians.</P>
<P>In the year 1170, Madoc&punc; &s;on of Owen Gwyn|nedh, Prince of Wales, di&s;&s;atisfied with the &s;i|tuation of affairs at home, left his country, as related by the Wel&s;h hi&s;torians, in que&s;t of new &s;ettlements, and leaving Ireland to the North, proceeded We&s;t till he di&s;covered a fertile coun|try; where, leaving a colony, he returned, and per&s;uading many of his country men to join him, put to &s;ea with ten &s;hips, and was never more heard of.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="018467_0095_0FA7A7B263425248">This account has, at &s;everal times, drawn the attention of the world; but as no ve&s;tiges of them had then been found, it was concluded, perhaps too ra&s;hly, to be a fable, or at lea&s;t, that no re|mains of the colony exi&s;ted. Of late years, how|ever, the We&s;tern &s;ettlers have received frequent accounts of a nation, inhabiting at a great di&s;|tance up the Mi&s;&s;ouri, in manners and appearance re&s;embling the other Indians, but &s;peaking Wel&s;h, and retaining &s;ome ceremonies of the chri&s;tian wor&s;hip; and at length, this is univer&s;ally be|lieved there to be a fact.</P>
<P>Captain Abraham Chaplain, of Kentucke, a gentleman, who&s;e veracity may be entirely depend|ed upon, a&s;&s;ured the author, that in the late war, being with his company in garri&s;on at Ka&s;ka&s;ky, &s;ome Indians came there, and, &s;peaking in the Wel&s;h dialect, were perfectly under&s;tood and conver&s;ed with by two Wel&s;hmen in his compa|ny, and that they informed them of the &s;itua|tion of their nation as mentioned above.</P>
<P>The author is &s;en&s;ible of the ridicule which the vain and the petulant may attempt to throw on this account; but as truth only has guided his pen, he is regardle&s;s of the con&s;equences, and flatters him&s;elf, that, by calling the attention of mankind once more to this &s;ubject, he may be the means of procuring a more accurate inquiry

into its truth, which, if it &s;hould even refute the &s;tory of the Wel&s;h, will at lea&s;t perform the important &s;ervice to the world, of promoting a more accurate di&s;covery of this immen&s;e conti|nent.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal ancient remains in Kentucke, which &s;eem to prove, that this country was for|merly inhabited by a nation farther advanced in the arts of life than the Indians. The&s;e are there u&s;ually attributed to the Wel&s;h, who are &s;uppo&s;|ed to have formerly inhabited here; but having been expelled by the natives, were forced to take refuge near the &s;ources of the Mi&s;&s;ouri.</P>
<P>It is well known, that no Indian nation has e|ver practi&s;ed the method of defending them&s;elves by entrenchments; and &s;uch a work would even be no ea&s;y one, while the&s;e nations were unac|quainted with the u&s;e of iron.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Lexington, the re|mains of two ancient fortifications are to be &s;een, furni&s;hed with ditches and ba&s;tions. One of the&s;e contains about &s;ix acres of land, and the o|ther nearly three. They are now overgrown with trees, which, by the number of circles in the wood, appear to be not le&s;s than one hundred and &s;ixty years old.

<P>The burying-grounds, which were mentioned above, under the head of Curio&s;ities, form ano|ther &s;trong argument that this country was for|merly inhabited by a people different from the pre&s;ent Indians. Although they do not di&s;cover any marks of extraordinary art in the &s;tructure, yet, as many nations are particularly tenacious of their ancient cu&s;toms, it may perhaps be worthy of enquiry, whether the&s;e repo&s;itories of the dead do not bear a con&s;iderable re&s;emblance to the ancient Briti&s;h remains. Some buildings, attri|buted to the Picts, are mentioned by the Scotti&s;h antiquaries, which, if the author mi&s;takes not, are formed nearly in the &s;ame manner. Let it be enough for him to point out the road, and hazard &s;ome uncertain conjectures. The day is not far di&s;tant, when the farthe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of this continent will be explored, and the accounts of the Wel&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, or con&s;igned to that oblivion which has already received &s;o many &s;uppo&s;itions founded on arguments as plau&s;ible as the&s;e.</P>

They &s;have, or pluck the hair off their heads, ex|cept a patch about the crown, which is orna|mented with beautiful feathers, beads, wampum, and &s;uch like baubles. Their ears are pared, and &s;tretched in a thong down to their &s;houlders. They are wound round with wire to expand them, and adorned with &s;ilver pendants, rings, and bells, which they likewi&s;e wear in their no&s;es.

de&s;truction of their enemies. They are very hardy, bearing heat, cold, hunger and thir&s;t, in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner, and yet no people are more addicted to exce&s;s in eating and drinking, when it is conveniently in their power. The follies, nay mi&s;chief, they commit when inebriated, are entirely laid to the liquor, and no one will revenge any injury (murder excepted) received from one who is no more him&s;elf. Among the Indians, all men are equal, per&s;onal qualities being mo&s;t e&s;teemed. No di&s;tinction of birth, no rank, renders any man capable of doing pre|judice to the rights of private per&s;ons; and there is no pre-eminence from merit, which begets pride, and which makes others too &s;en&s;ible of their own inferiority. Though there is perhaps le&s;s delicacy of &s;entiment in the Indians than a|mong&s;t us; there is, however, abundantly more probity, with infinitely le&s;s ceremony, or equivocal compliments. Their public conferences &s;hew them to be men of genius; and they have, in a high degree, the talent of natural eloquence.</P>
<P>They live di&s;per&s;ed in &s;mall villages, either in the woods, or on the banks of rivers, where they have little plantations of Indian-corn, and roots, not enough to &s;upply their families half the year, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting the remainder of it by hunting, fi&s;hing and fowling, and the fruits of

<P>THE accounts of travellers, concerning their religion, are various; and although it cannot be ab&s;olutely affirmed that they have none, yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed very difficult to define what it is. All agree that they acknowledge one Su|preme God, but do not adore him.

They &s;eem al&s;o to believe in a future &s;tate, and that after death they &s;hall be removed to their friends who have gone before them, to an ely&s;ium, or paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Wyandotts, near Detroit, and &s;ome others, have the Roman Catholic religion introduced among&s;t them by mi&s;&s;ionaries. The&s;e have a church, a mini&s;ter, and a regular burying-ground.

<P>They have their fe&s;tivals, and other rejoicing-days, on which they &s;ing and dance in a ring, taking hands, having &s;o painted and di&s;gui&s;ed them&s;elves, that it is difficult to know any of them; and after enjoying this diver&s;ion for a while, they retire to the place where they have prepared a fea&s;t of fi&s;h, fle&s;h, fowls and fruits; to which all are invited, and entertained with their country &s;ongs. They believe that there is great virtue in fea&s;ts for the &s;ick. For this pur|po&s;e a young buck mu&s;t be killed, and boiled, the friends and near neighbours of the patient invited, and having fir&s;t thrown tobacco on the the fire, and covered it up clo&s;e, they all &s;it down in a ring, and rai&s;e a lamentable cry. They then uncover the fire, and kindle it up; and the head of the buck is fir&s;t &s;ent about, every one taking a bit, and giving a loud croak, in imitation of crows.

<P>The women are very &s;laves to the men; which is a common ca&s;e in rude, unpoli&s;hed nations, throughout the world. They are charged with being revengeful; but this revenge is only doing them&s;elves ju&s;tice on tho&s;e who injure them,

The&s;e taken collec|tively, excepting the latter, Kentucke po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in a &s;uperior degree: And, agreeable to our de|&s;cription of the we&s;tern trade, we conclude, that it will be nearly equal to any other on the conti|nent of America, and the di&s;advantages it is &s;ub|ject to, be fully compen&s;ated by the fertility of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>This fertile region, abounding with all the lux|uries of nature, &s;tored with all the principal ma|terials for art and indu&s;try, inhabited by vir|tuous and ingenious citizens, mu&s;t univer&s;ally attract the attention of mankind, being &s;ituated in the central part of the exten&s;ive American em|pire,

To you innumerable multitudes will emigrate from the hateful regions of de&s;poti&s;m and tyran|ny; and you will &s;urely welcome them as friends, as brothers; you will welcome them to partake with you of your happine&s;s.&mdash;Let the memory of Lycurgus, the Spartan legi&s;lator who bani&s;h|ed covetou&s;ne&s;s, and the love of gold from his country; the excellent Locke, who fir&s;t taught the doctrine of toleration; the venerable Penn, the fir&s;t who founded a city of brethren; and Wa&s;hington, the defender and protector of per&s;ecuted liberty, be ever the illu&s;trious exam|ples of your political conduct. Avail your&s;elves
<PB N="109" REF="018467_0108_0FA7A7C1646517C8">
of the benefits of nature, and of the fruitful coun|try you inhabit.</P>
<P>Let the iron of your mines, the wool of your flocks, your flax and hemp, the &s;kins of the &s;a|vage animals that wander in your woods, be fa|&s;hioned into manufactures, and take an extraor|dinary value from your hands. Then will you rival the &s;uperfluities of Europe, and know that happine&s;s may be found, without the commerce &s;o univer&s;ally de&s;ired by mankind.</P>
<P>In your country, like the land of promi&s;e, flowing with milk and honey, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths, that &s;pring out of valleys and hills, a land of wheat and barley, and all kinds of fruits, you &s;hall eat bread without &s;carcene&s;s, and not lack any thing in it; where you are neither chilled with the cold of capricorn, nor &s;corched with the burn|ing heat of cancer; the mildne&s;s of your air &s;o great, that you neither feel the effects of infec|tious fogs, nor pe&s;tilential vapours. Thus, your country, favoured with the &s;miles of heaven, will probably be inhabited by the fir&s;t people the world ever knew.</P>
