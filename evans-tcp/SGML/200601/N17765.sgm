<HEAD>The Secretary of State, to whom was referred by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives the letter of John H. Mitchell, reciting cer|tain propo&s;als, for &s;upplying the United States with COPPER COINAGE, has had the &s;ame under con&s;ideration, according to in&s;tructions, and begs leave to report thereon as follows.</HEAD>
<P>THE per&s;on who wi&s;hes to undertake the &s;upply of a Copper Coinage, &s;ets forth, that the &s;uperiority of his apparatus and proce&s;s for coining, enables him to furni&s;h a coinage, better and cheaper than can be done by any country or per&s;on whatever: that his dies are engraved by the fir&s;t arti&s;t in that line in Europe: that his apparatus for &s;triking the edge, at the &s;ame blow with the faces, is new and &s;ingularly ingenious: that he coins by a pre&s;s on a new principle, and worked by a fine engine more regularly than can be done by hand; that he will deliver any quantity of coin, of any &s;ize and device, of pure and unalloyed copper, wrapped in paper, and packed in ca&s;ks ready for &s;hipping, for fourteen pence &s;terling the pound.</P>
<P>The Secretary of State has before been appri&s;ed, from other &s;ources of information, of the great improvements made by this undertaker in &s;undry arts: he is acquainted with the arti&s;t who invented the method of &s;triking the edge and both faces of the coin at one blow: he has &s;een his proce&s;s and coins, and &s;ent to the former Congre&s;s &s;ome &s;pecimens of them, with cer|tain offers from him before he entered into the &s;ervice of the pre&s;ent under|taker (which &s;pecimens he takes the liberty of now &s;ubmitting to the in&s;pec|tion of the Hou&s;e, as proofs of the &s;uperiority of this method of coinage in gold and &s;ilver, as well as copper).</P>
<P>He is therefore of opinion, that the undertaker, aided by that arti&s;t, and by his own excellent machines, is truly in a condition to furni&s;h coin in a &s;tate of higher perfection than has ever yet been i&s;&s;ued by any nation: that perfection in the engraving is among the great &s;afeguards again&s;t counterfeits, becau&s;e engravers of the fir&s;t cla&s;s are few, and elevated, by their rank in their art, far above the ba&s;e and dangerous bu&s;ine&s;s of coun|terfeiting. That the perfection of coins will indeed di&s;appear, after they are for &s;ome time worn among other pieces, and e&s;pecially where the figures are rather faintly relieved as on tho&s;e of this arti&s;t: yet their high fini&s;hing while new, is not the le&s;s a guard again&s;t counterfeits; becau&s;e the&s;e, if carried to any extent, mu&s;t be u&s;hered into circulation new al&s;o, and con&s;e|quently may be compared with genuine coins in the &s;ame &s;tate: that there|fore, whenever the United States &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to have a coin of their own, it will be de&s;irable to aim at this kind of perfection: that this cannot be better effected than by availing them&s;elves, if po&s;&s;ible, of the &s;ervices of the undertaker and of this arti&s;t, who&s;e excellent methods and machines are &s;aid to have abridged, as well as perfected the operations of coinage. The&s;e operations, however, and their expence being new and unknown here, he is unable to &s;ay whether the price propo&s;ed be rea&s;onable or not.&mdash;He is al&s;o uncertain whether, in&s;tead of the larger copper coin, the legi&s;lature might not prefer a lighter one of billon, or mixed metal, as is practi&s;ed with convenience by &s;everal other nations, a &s;pecimen of which kind of coinage is &s;ubmitted to their in&s;pection.</P>
<P><PB REF="023001_0002_0FBAD240AE443148">But the propo&s;itions under con&s;ideration, &s;uppo&s;e that the work is to be carried on in a foreign country, and that the implements are to remain the property of the undertaker; which conditions, in his opinion render them inadmi&s;&s;ible, for the&s;e rea&s;ons&mdash;</P>
<P>Coinage is peculiarly an attribute of &s;overeignty; to transfer its exerci&s;e into another country, is to &s;ubmit it to another &s;overeign.</P>
<P>Its tran&s;portation acro&s;s the ocean, be&s;ides the ordinary dangers of the &s;ea, would expo&s;e it to acts of piracy by the crews to whom it would be confided, as well as by others appri&s;ed of its pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>In time of war it would offer to the enterprizes of an enemy, what have been emphatically called the &s;inews of war.</P>
<P>If the war were with the nation within who&s;e territory the coinage is, the fir&s;t act of war or repri&s;al might be to arre&s;t this operation, with the im|plements and materials, coined and uncoined, to be u&s;ed at their di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The reputation and principles of the pre&s;ent undertaker, are &s;afeguards again&s;t the abu&s;es of a coinage carried on in a foreign country, where no checks could be provided by the proper &s;overeign, no regulations e&s;tabli&s;hed, no police, no guard exerci&s;ed; in &s;hort, none of the numerous cautions hi|therto thought e&s;&s;ential at every mint; but in hands le&s;s entitled to confi|dence, the&s;e will become dangers. We may be &s;ecured indeed, by proper experiments as to the purity of the coin delivered us according to contract, but we cannot be &s;ecured again&s;t that which, though le&s;s pure, &s;hall be &s;truck in the genuine dye, and protected again&s;t the vigilance of government till it &s;hall have entered into circulation.</P>
<P>We lo&s;e the opportunity of calling in and recoining the clipped money in circulation, or we double our ri&s;ks by a double tran&s;portation.</P>
<P>We lo&s;e in like manner the re&s;ource of coining up our hou&s;hold plate in the in&s;tant of great di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>We lo&s;e the means of forming arti&s;ts to continue the works, when the common accidents of mortality &s;hall have deprived us of tho&s;e who began them.</P>
<P>In fine, the carrying on a coinage in a foreign country, as far as the Se|cretary knows, is without example; and general example is weighty au|thority.</P>
<P>He is therefore of opinion on the whole&mdash;That a mint, whenever e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed at home: that the &s;uperiority, the merit, and means of the undertaker, will &s;ugge&s;t him as the proper per&s;on to be engaged in the e&s;tabli&s;hment and conduct of a mint, on a &s;cale, which, relinqui&s;hing nothing in the perfection of the coin, &s;hall be duly proportioned to our pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>And in the mean while he is of opinion, the pre&s;ent propo&s;als &s;hould be declined.</P>
