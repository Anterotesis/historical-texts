they are but the first, rude, untranscribed Notes of <HI>Sermons</HI> uttered in my ordinary Course of Preaching more than once or twice commonly in a Week; and strangers abroad in the world may without the least wrong to <HI>me,</HI> believe, That <HI>New-England</HI> is a Countrey wherein there are every week in the year delivered more than Two <HI>Hundred Sermons,</HI> to be preferred unto the <HI>Best of</HI> These.

made us <HI>Both.</HI> It is indeed a peice of <HI>Self-Deni|al</HI> that your Commands have obliged me unto; for whatever others may think of <HI>Appearing in Print,</HI> my own Opinion of it is, that unless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> man be extremely unacquainted both with him|self, and with the world, he will be rather <HI>A|fraid</HI> or <HI>Asham'd</HI> of it, than <HI>Taken</HI> with it; Let him that wants <HI>Humbling</HI> become an <HI>Authour,</HI> and he shall have it, if <HI>mean Thoughts</HI> have not made him utterly <HI>Unsensible.</HI> Nothing but a <HI>Re|spect</HI> unto the <HI>Interest</HI> of God and of Truth, and a <HI>Resolve</HI> to go cheerfully thro' much Contempt, Obloquy, Detrectation, can make any <HI>considerate</HI> Person to Salute mankind in the Quality of a <HI>Writer.</HI> But Since it is my <HI>Duty</HI> to be (like ho|ly <HI>Bradford</HI>) alwayes doing <HI>Good,</HI> with <HI>Tongue,</HI> or <HI>Pen,</HI> or <HI>Purse,</HI> I should account it my <HI>Honour</HI> if my <HI>Pen</HI> may be employed for any Advance|ment of <HI>Practical Godliness,</HI> tho' it Cost me ne|ver so many <HI>Temptations,</HI> as it must cost me not a few.</P>

<P>TO <HI>do some,</HI> and <HI>gain</HI> more <HI>Service</HI> for our God, the Text now before us is to be Dis|coursed on.</P>
<P>These words are among the <HI>last</HI> words of <HI>Joshuah, the servant of the Lord,</HI> they are a Devout and a Divine sentence uttered by the renouned <HI>Joshua</HI> in a Speech to <HI>The Parliament of</HI> Israel. The <HI>Dying Words</HI> of all Great and Good men, have usually been esteemed Remarkable by the Survivers; and those books which contain <HI>Apoph|th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gmala <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> have been reckoned perhaps among the most useful in the world. Tho the <HI>Dying Songs</HI> of <HI>Swans</HI> have not been such things as the <HI>Vulgar Error</HI> has reputed them; yet the <HI>Dying Words</HI> of <HI>Saints</HI> have afforded a fit <HI>Moral</HI> for the <HI>Fable.</HI> The speech of a Dying Saint has as deep a favour of <HI>Heaven,</HI> as the <HI>Breath</HI> of a dying man has of <HI>Earth.</HI> But me thinks, the <HI>Dy|ing Words</HI> of a <HI>Joshua</HI> should be peculiar <HI>Oracles;</HI> peruse them, and you will find them so. He had been first, the <HI>Lord-General</HI> of <HI>Israels</HI> Army; and
<PB N="3" REF="000487_0011_0FA6723F1947FC20">
was now the <HI>Lord Protector</HI> of <HI>Israels</HI> Common|Wealth. In this Capacity, a few months be|fore he dy'd he issued out orders for a <HI>Conventi|on of States,</HI> to meet at <HI>She<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hem</HI> a place about forty miles from his own Abode. The <HI>Senate,</HI> the <HI>Judges,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Officers</HI> and all the <HI>Representa|tives</HI> of the people being assembled, before the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> which on this extraordinary occasion was removed hither, this famous Prince endea|vours to settle &amp; confirm them in the <HI>Service</HI> of the living God. It is likely he feared a secret Retaining of <HI>Idolatry</HI> among many, while he was yet alive; but it is <HI>certain,</HI> he fore-saw an open Defection to <HI>Idolatry</HI> hastening upon them, when he should be <HI>dend</HI> and <HI>gone.</HI> Wherefore, he laies in against it, by a most powerful and pathe|tic <HI>Speech,</HI> which has in it,</P>
<P>First, An <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Memorable Providences</HI> wherein they had experienced the matchless kindness of God unto them.</P>
<P>Secondly, An <HI>Inference</HI> from this <HI>History;</HI> which is expressed in two things.</P>
<P>First, A <HI>Counsil.</HI> He concludes, <HI>Now therefore fear the Lord and serve</HI> Him. <HI>Therefore!</HI> Wherefore? Why, inasmuch as you find the Lord so bountiful, that you cannot possibly <HI>A|mend</HI> your selves if you leave Him, or <HI>excuse</HI> your selves if you grieve Him. <HI>Therefore</HI> are you to <HI>fear</HI> Him, <HI>serve</HI> Him. Every <HI>Mercy</HI> of God hath a <HI>Therefore,</HI> in it; it calls for Grati|tude
<PB N="4" REF="000487_0012_0FA6724344FA3F08">
and Obedience. When God has been merci|ful to us, even <HI>common</HI> Ingenuity, end much more, <HI>holy</HI> Ingenuity will put us upon that En|quiry, <HI>What shall I render to the Lord?</HI> Behold an Answer in this, <HI>Therefore!</HI> We are <HI>There|fore</HI> to <HI>fear the Lord and serve him;</HI> we are <HI>Therefore</HI> to put away all our <HI>Idols,</HI> all our <HI>Follies</HI> for ever more.</P>
<P>Secondly, A <HI>Copy.</HI> He gives them a <HI>Precedent,</HI> an <HI>Exemple,</HI> to induce them hereunto. The Pattern of a <HI>considerable person,</HI> has no inconside|rable Influence upon the Observers of it. Such an one does <HI>good</HI> or <HI>ill,</HI> even like a <HI>Briareus,</HI> with an <HI>Hundred</HI> Hands. An <HI>Hundred,</HI> &amp; an <HI>Hundred</HI> more will do like <HI>Him.</HI> If he be wick|ed he does according to the Language of <HI>Solo|mon, Speak with his Feet.</HI> If he be Godly, he is, according to the Character of <HI>John,</HI> a <HI>Voice,</HI> Such an One most effectually bespeaks all about him, as <HI>Gideon</HI> did once, <HI>Do what you see</HI> me to do.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Joshua</HI> enforces his <HI>farewel Exhortation</HI> here; faith he, <HI>Be it known to you, that I and my house will serve the Lord;</HI> I was once your <HI>Lea|der,</HI> pray let me be so still. As I leadd you into the <HI>Canaan</HI> of the Lord, let me have so much credit with you, as also to lead you unto the <HI>Service</HI> of the Lord. Be assured, I shall be a <HI>Witness</HI> against you another day, if you do not now receive me as a <HI>Copy</HI> for you.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROP. 1.</HEAD>
<P>The whole <HI>Duty</HI> of man, is contained in the true <HI>Service</HI> of God. Both in the <HI>First</HI> Cove|nant, and in the <HI>New</HI> Covenant which God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> made with man, there is a <HI>Duty</HI> which man must pay to God.

It is the same that the Wise man re|fers unto, in <HI>Ecel,</HI> 12. 13. <HI>Fear God and keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> commandmens; for this is the whole duty of man</HI> There are diverse comprehensive and synonymous <HI>Terms,</HI> by which our <HI>Duty</HI> to God is expressed in the Scripture of Truth. our
<PB N="6" REF="000487_0014_0FA6724520FB2168">
<HI>Duty</HI> is called <HI>A Serving of God,</HI> as it refers to the <HI>Acts</HI> of our lives in which; but its also cal|led <HI>A Fearing of God,</HI> and <HI>A Loving of God,</HI> as it refers to the <HI>Frames</HI> of our hearts, <HI>with</HI> we are to do it. It is called, <HI>A Knowing of God,</HI> as it refers to the principle of it; it is likewise a <HI>Living</HI> to Him, and <HI>Walking</HI> with Him, on the same accounts that it is a <HI>Serving</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Service</HI> of God notes two things, which are to accompany our whole <HI>Duty</HI> to him.</P>
<P>It notes, first, the <HI>Homage</HI> therein done to our God. The <HI>Service</HI> of God is His <HI>Worship,</HI> His <HI>natural</HI> Worship, and His <HI>appointed</HI> Worship. Hence the <HI>Septuagint</HI> so translate our Text, <HI>I and my house will</HI> worship <HI>the Lord.</HI> We <HI>serve</HI> God, when we render to him his <HI>Natural</HI> Wor|ship. So tis intimated in <HI>Deut.</HI> 10. 12. <HI>Fear the Lord thy God, walk in His waies, love him, &amp;</HI> serve <HI>the Lord thy God with all thy Heart.</HI> When we <HI>hope</HI> in God, when we <HI>call</HI> on God, when we <HI>cleave</HI> to God, then we <HI>serve</HI> Him. And we <HI>serve</HI> God when we render to Him his <HI>appointed</HI> Worship. This was intended in <HI>Exod.</HI> 8. 1. <HI>Let my people go, that they may serve me.</HI> We <HI>serve</HI> Him when we <HI>observe</HI> the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of God, when we adore him according to the Rules of His Word in His <HI>House,</HI> and wait upon him in the use of his blessed and sacred <HI>Institutions.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Secondly, notes the <HI>Honour</HI> therein brought
<PB N="7" REF="000487_0015_0FA67245DCB8D050">
to our God. <HI>Service</HI> is perform'd to God, when <HI>Glory</HI> is procur'd for Him. His <HI>Essential</HI> Glory we can by no means advance, we may His <HI>de|clarative;</HI> and therein we <HI>serve</HI> the Lord.

<P>There are two Questions which I hope every Child within these Walls can give some right Answer to. The Answer to them will render it <HI>unquestionable,</HI> That you and I are to <HI>Serve</HI> God for ever.</P>

that has made us, and not we our selves.</HI> Thus did the Psalmist once argue, <HI>O come, let us worship be|fore the Lord our maker.</HI> Why? If he be our <HI>Maker,</HI> He is to be the Object of our <HI>Service.</HI> And this the rather, because of another Questi|on, which is, <HI>For What were you made?</HI> We have an Answer to this in <HI>Isa.</HI> 43. 21. <HI>This peo|ple have I formed for</HI> my Self, <HI>they shall shew forth my praise.</HI> When we <HI>praise God,</HI> we <HI>serve</HI> God.

<P>We are to <HI>serve</HI> God, because Christ has <HI>Bought</HI> us. Indeed, the <HI>Arminian universal Re|demption</HI> we reject with a just abhorrence. The <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of our Lord Redeemer, was not <HI>Intended</HI> by Him, for the <HI>Redemption</HI> of <HI>all</HI> mankind; nor was it <HI>Intended</HI> any further than his <HI>Intercession</HI> is, which reaches only to the E|lect of God.

to be done by men which <HI>God</HI> is not the Doer of; otherwise, men would themselves be the <HI>Prin|cipals</HI> in procuring their own Salvation. But one scope of our Lord's Death was even to pur|chase for us, that <HI>Grace,</HI> that <HI>Faith,</HI> that <HI>Free-Will,</HI> which may qualifie us to enjoy the <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Success</HI> of it. Certainly <HI>Peter</HI> was more be|holden unto the Merit of Christ for <HI>his</HI> Redemp|tion, than <HI>Judas</HI> was for <HI>his.</HI> Yet the <HI>Purchase</HI> of Christ wonderfully binds us <HI>all</HI> to the <HI>Service</HI> of God.</P>
<P>For <HI>First,</HI> the <HI>Redemption</HI> of Christ has made our <HI>Serving</HI> of God, a <HI>possible thing.</HI> Had it not been for this, poor fallen undone man had never been in a Capacity to <HI>Serve</HI> the Lord.

We must have continued the <HI>Slaves</HI> of the devil for ever, if the <HI>Stings</HI> of the Dragon had not fastned on the Lord. The Lord Jesus has bought us all into such a Con|dition, that the Proffers and the Tenders of the Gospel might be made unto us. We are told of some in 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 1. Who <HI>Deny the Lord that bought them.</HI> O vile Sacriledge and Impiety! That we might all have the priviledge of an Invitation to the <HI>Service</HI> of God, this has

cost no less than the <HI>Heart-bloud</HI> of Christ; and what a monstrous villany were it for us now to despite the Invitation? <HI>Again,</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Redemption</HI> of Christ has made our <HI>Ser|ving</HI> of God, a <HI>Reasonable</HI> thing. We are all among the Redeemed, either in Reality, or at least in Possession, all the <HI>Chosen</HI> and <HI>Called</HI> of God, are most <HI>really</HI> interested in the Sacrifice of the Lord Jesus; and therefore, for them to decline the <HI>Service</HI> of God, were as <HI>unequal</HI> as it is <HI>unlikely.</HI> But every one of us is at least <HI>professedly</HI> interested in it.

<HEAD>PROP. III.</HEAD>
<P>Every man should engage HIS HOUSE also in the <HI>Service</HI> of the Almighty God. We are all related unto some <HI>House</HI> or other. Some|times a <HI>Nation</HI> is called by that name. So tis said in Exek. 3. 1. <HI>Speak to the</HI> House <HI>of Israel.</HI> And thus, every man should labour to promote the Service of God in the <HI>Nation</HI> which he be|longs unto.

<P>We should engage our <HI>Houses</HI> to the <HI>Service</HI> of God, out of <HI>Respect</HI> to God Himself. To the

<HI>Householder</HI> it may well be said, <HI>For God's sake look after thy House; For God's sake, Let there be God's</HI> Service <HI>in it.</HI> To speak particularly,</P>
<P>First, The <HI>Commandment</HI> of God calls for it. We have this <HI>Commandment</HI> often repeated unto us. That we should be careful about the <HI>In|struction</HI> and <HI>Conversion</HI> of them that we are charged with. Tis a <HI>Commandment</HI> inculcated in the <HI>Old</HI> Testament. We have in Deut. 6. 6, 7. <HI>The words which I command thee, thou shalt diligently</HI> teach <HI>them unto thy</HI> Children. We have it again, in Psal. 78. 67. <HI>He commanded our fa|thers, that they should make known unto their</HI> Chil|dren, <HI>that these might set their hope in God, and keep his Commandments.</HI> We have it once more in Deut. 4. 9, 10. <HI>Gather the people, that they may learn to fear me, and that they may</HI> teach <HI>their Children.</HI> Tis a <HI>Commandment</HI> not unmention|ed in the <HI>New</HI> Testament also. We find in <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 4. <HI>Ye</HI> Fathers, <HI>bring up your</HI> Children <HI>in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</HI> Behold, How many solemn Charges are laid upon us to do our part, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> God may be <HI>served</HI> by all that are under our inspection. God does <HI>Command us,</HI> to <HI>command</HI> them, thereabout.</P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>Interest</HI> of God calls for it. Our Lord said unto a <HI>Peter,</HI> in <HI>Joh,</HI> 21. 15. <HI>Lo|vest thou me?&mdash;Then Feed my Lambs.</HI> The like may be said unto a <HI>Master,</HI> If thou doest love God, then bring thy <HI>lambs</HI> to <HI>serve</HI> Him.

<P>First, our <HI>Houses</HI> are <HI>miserable</HI> thro' us, if they do not <HI>serve</HI> God.

Our <HI>Houses</HI> are <HI>starving,</HI> while our God is not <HI>serving</HI> in them. The Prophet said in <HI>Lam.</HI> 2. 11. <HI>Mine eyes do fail with tears, because the children swoon in the streets of the city; they say to their mothers, where is the corn?</HI> O doleful spectacle! But while our Children are strangers to God, there is a worse <HI>Famine</HI> in our <HI>Houses,</HI> we suffer their Souls to pine and perish without the <HI>Bread</HI> of life. Yea, our Houses are <HI>Burning</HI> while our God is not <HI>Serving</HI> in them. What a terrible desolation was that on <HI>Sodom!</HI> in allusion to which, tis said of a wicked man, in <HI>Job.</HI> 18. 15. <HI>Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</HI> Why, there is a dreadful storm of ardent Brimstone, ready to fall upon those <HI>Houses,</HI> where the Children are not bringing up for God; the Wrath of God, like an <HI>horrible Tempest</HI> of burning Brimstone is impending over them. What shall I say more? Our poor Children are enslaved unto Satan, un|til they come to be <HI>serving</HI> of God If a <HI>Devil</HI> bed a <HI>Bodily</HI> Possession of our Children, how

<P><PB N="26" REF="000487_0034_0FA67263E6B83B40">
There is a Four-fold Concernment that will now lye upon you.</P>
<P>First. Be studious to <HI>know</HI> what <HI>Service</HI> God calleth for. Ly at His Feet, and say as <HI>Paul</HI> of old, <HI>Lord, What wouldest thou have me to do?</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> like <HI>Samuel</HI> once, <HI>Speak Lord, for thy servant hear|eth.</HI> Be daily <HI>Reading</HI> of the Word, be daily <HI>Thinking</HI> on the Word: upon every opportunity say, <HI>I will hear what God the Lord will say.</HI> Yo all, add That, as your daily Petition unto God; in <HI>Psal.</HI> 11<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 115. <HI>I am thy</HI> servant, <HI>O Lord; give me understandeng that I may know thy testimo|nies.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Be <HI>ready</HI> to <HI>Do</HI> what <HI>Service</HI> God calleth for. Never object, never cavil against any of Gods Commands; never dispute any thing that He requires; but own, <HI>'Tis all holy, and just, and Good.</HI> Be not more undutiful unto <HI>God,</HI> than the <HI>servants</HI> of the Centurion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ere to <HI>him;</HI> If <HI>He</HI> say, <HI>Go,</HI> then <HI>go;</HI> if <HI>He</HI> say <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ome,</HI> then <HI>come;</HI> if <HI>He</HI> say, <HI>Do this,</HI> then <HI>do it,</HI> without any Grumbling at it. Say not, <HI>I won't,</HI> altho there be <HI>Hard Sayings</HI> pressed upon thee. Albeit God may enjoin this, <HI>Pluck out thy</HI> right eye, <HI>out off thy</HI> right hand; and albeit the Injunction of God may be; <HI>Take up thy Cross;</HI> yet Comply, yet, Conform, without any Reluctancies; and say with him in Psal. 119. 128. <HI>O Lord, I esteem all thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> concerning all things, to be right.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly Be greatly <HI>Contriving</HI> how&punc; to be
<PB N="27" REF="000487_0035_0FA67264A0D58C50">
most <HI>serviceable</HI> unto God. Ponder well, What you <HI>are,</HI> What you <HI>have,</HI> What you <HI>can;</HI> and Ponder how all may be improved in the <HI>Service</HI> of the Lord. Thus be <HI>Zealous of good Works:</HI> Never be satisfied unless you can say, <HI>I am at work for God.</HI> Let even your <HI>Eating;</HI> your <HI>Tra|ding</HI> your <HI>Visiting,</HI> be done as a <HI>Service</HI> for the Lord; and let your <HI>Time,</HI> your <HI>Strength,</HI> your <HI>Estates,</HI> all the <HI>Powers</HI> of your Spirits, and all the <HI>Members</HI> of your bodies, be ingeniously laid out in that <HI>Service.</HI> Often ask your own souls, <HI>What is there that I may do for God?</HI> Even court, and hum Advantages to be <HI>serviceable;</HI> Say like the Prophet, In Isa. 6. 8. Say, <HI>Lord, if thou hast any</HI> Service <HI>to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e done, here I am, send me&punc;</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. Be sweetly <HI>Contented</HI> with all the <HI>Allowances</HI> of the Lord. <HI>John Baptist</HI> gave this Counsel to the <HI>servants</HI> in the <HI>Roman</HI> Garrisons, <HI>Luc.</HI> 3. 14. <HI>Be</HI> content <HI>with your Wages.</HI> The <HI>Servants</HI> in God's Houshold, have the same Coun|sel, in Heb. 13 5. <HI>Be</HI> content <HI>with such things as you have.</HI> Tho you should have but short Commons, and straw lodgings in the world; tho you should be without many Flesh-pleasing Curiosities and Conveniencies, let this quiet you, <HI>I am a</HI> Servant. Don't complain of the Lord, as the slothful and wicked <HI>servant</HI> once, <HI>He is an hard Master.</HI> Let <HI>your</HI> Wills be moulded and melted into <HI>His;</HI> and cheerfully leave Him to judge; What may be <HI>Food</HI> convenient for you.
<PB N="28" REF="000487_0036_0FA672659C7E6730">
Count that you have <HI>enough,</HI> when God saies, <HI>you shall have no more;</HI> and alwaies have a good Opinion of Gods Disposals. Learn <HI>Pauls</HI> Lesson, <HI>In whatever state to be content.</HI> It is not for <HI>Beg|gars,</HI> nor <HI>Servants</HI> to be <HI>Choosers.</HI></P>

1. To offer some <HI>Directions</HI> about <HI>Family-Prayer.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="rule">
<P>The First Rule.</P>
<P>Let all <HI>Persons</HI> that should attend <HI>Family|prayer,</HI> count themselves concern'd to <HI>Pray without ceasing.</HI> Every <HI>Master</HI> of an House, is to carry on the <HI>Prayer</HI> in it. That man is not fit to have an <HI>House,</HI> that cannot make a <HI>Prayer,</HI> But if the Master be <HI>absent?</HI> Then the <HI>Masters</HI> is to see still that <HI>Prayer</HI> be not wanting. It seems af|firmed of <HI>Esther,</HI> a Woman, in <HI>Cap.</HI> 4. 16. That she <HI>pray'd</HI> with her <HI>Maidens.</HI> There should not be one Prayer the less in a Family, because a <HI>Widow</HI> is become the Ruler there: No, the <HI>Losses</HI> of a Family, should increase the <HI>Prayers</HI> of it. And let the Master of a <HI>Ship,</HI> remember, That the Sailers are his <HI>Family.</HI> He should <HI>pray</HI> with them aboard, every day while they are at Sea together. You that see the <HI>Wonders</HI> of God together, should together sing the <HI>Praises</HI> of God, and together beg the <HI>Mercies</HI> of God. Methinks, the poor <HI>Sea-men,</HI> should be the <HI>best men</HI> in the world. With what face can you pray in a <HI>Storm,</HI> if you do not also pray in a <HI>Calm?</HI> Now <HI>Master,</HI> tis <HI>your</HI> Work, tis part of your <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> from your great <HI>Owner</HI> to see that this be done.

How can <HI>Scolding,</HI> and it may be <HI>Striking</HI> too, agree with <HI>Praying,</HI> in which we are to <HI>lift up pure hands, without wrath?</HI> Again, Let not family-<HI>Scabs</HI> hinder family-Prayers. <HI>Bad-Members</HI> in a family, often cause that there are <HI>no</HI> Prayers in it. Many men will not <HI>Pray,</HI> because others will <HI>scoff</HI> and <HI>flout.</HI> But let your Houses have no such <HI>In-mates,</HI> no such <HI>Ishmaels</HI> in them.

If any profane, graceless, Despisers of Prayer, would impose themselves upon us, let us then say to them, <HI>Depart ye workers of iniquity. for I will call upon the Lord.</HI> Once more,</P>
<P>Let not <HI>Family-Prayers</HI> be hindred by <HI>unsuitable Times.</HI> The <HI>earlier</HI> we dispatch them, the <HI>easier.</HI> We should not ordinarily let <HI>Business</HI> royl us in the morning, nor <HI>Drowsiness</HI> drown us in the Evening, before <HI>Family Prayer</HI> be over.

prayers. Understand, that <HI>Secret</HI> Prayers, as well as <HI>private</HI> Prayers, are to be performed by us all. For this, the word of our Lord is very positive, in <HI>Matth.</HI> 6. 6. <HI>When thou prayest, en|ter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in</HI> secret. Tis a great fondness and folly in any of us, if <HI>private</HI> prayer cause us to lay aside <HI>secret</HI> prayer. No, There is <HI>Closet</HI>-Prayer as well as <HI>Parlour</HI>-Pray|er which we ought to labour in. I would say, as our Lord in another case, <HI>One you ought to do; &amp; not leave the other undone.</HI> We have <HI>special Trans|gressions</HI> to be confessed in our prayers; these are <HI>secretly</HI> to be confessed. To divulge a <HI>secret sin,</HI> is to add a <HI>further sin,</HI> Our <HI>secret sins,</HI> do call for our <HI>secret Prayers.</HI> We have <HI>special Temp|tations</HI> to be bewailed in our prayers; and these are <HI>secretly</HI> to be bewailed. Our <HI>Desires</HI> are some|times to be too <HI>secret</HI> for our Neighbours. Out <HI>secret Griefs</HI> and our <HI>secret Fears</HI> call for our <HI>se|cret Prayers.</HI> And as one of the Ancients ele|gantly expresses it, <HI>Invisible prayers are to be of|ten made to an invisible God. Secret prayer</HI> is one good sign of a <HI>gracious heart.</HI> Let the Lord oft see you like <HI>Nathanael</HI> at <HI>secret prayer</HI> under the <HI>Fig-tree,</HI> and He will say, <HI>Behold an Israelite in|deed!</HI> Would you get <HI>Internal</HI> Blessings? then pray in <HI>secret. Solomon</HI> got his Widom, his Ver|tue, by <HI>secret prayer. Peter</HI> by <HI>secret prayer</HI> in a Balconie, was carried with Trances and Rap|tures
<PB N="35" REF="000487_0043_0FA6726FEAC17328">
into the other world. Would you get <HI>External</HI> Blessings? Then pray in <HI>secret. Han|nah</HI> with <HI>secret prayer</HI> asked <HI>one</HI> Son, and had <HI>six. Jacob</HI> had all his House preserved by <HI>secret prayer.</HI> Yea, Would you Be <HI>General</HI> Blessings? Pray then in <HI>secret. Moses</HI> by <HI>secret prayer</HI> divert|ed wrath &amp; plagues from all the Congregation. That infamous Apostate <HI>Julian,</HI> was killed by the <HI>secret prayer</HI> of a good man, at that hour very far distant from him. What shall I say? No <HI>Super sedeas,</HI> no Diversion should ever be given to your <HI>secret prayers.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, besides your Prayers with <HI>all</HI> the Family, you may do well sometimes to Retire unto prayers with this or that particular person in it. Some do so translate that passage in <HI>Gen.</HI> 25. 21. <HI>Isaac <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Lord</HI> with <HI>his wife.</HI> It were but a discreet and a decent practice, for married persons to <HI>do likewise.</HI> Thus, holy <HI>Pa|rents,</HI> have often taken their Children, <HI>one</HI> by <HI>one</HI> alone; and there pray'd and wept, and pour'd out their souls, over the <HI>poor lambs</HI> in secret places before the Lord. Thus are we to do, Thus to <HI>pray.</HI></P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="excuse">
<HEAD>The First Excuse.</HEAD>
<P>One man doth so Excuse himself. <HI>I want</HI> Time <HI>for Family-prayer; especially in a</HI> Morning, <HI>I can't spare the</HI> Time.</P>
<P>This is a most horrid and wicked Excuse. Thou Madman, <HI>From Whom</HI> hast thou all thy <HI>Time? All</HI> thy Time is given by God, and shall <HI>None</HI> of thy Time be given <HI>to</HI> God? What <HI>No Time</HI> to pray with thy Family? God knowes thou canst find <HI>time</HI> to <HI>cat</HI> with thy fa|mily, <HI>time</HI> to <HI>sleep</HI> with thy family, perhaps, <HI>time</HI> to <HI>smoke</HI> with thy family; and no Time to <HI>pray</HI> with em? Once more,</P>
<P>What is it that does engross thy <HI>Time,</HI> and put by thy <HI>Prayer?</HI> Tis the <HI>World,</HI> the <HI>World!</HI> And is <HI>that</HI> such a Portion indeed, as to bespeak thy Contempt of an Eternal <HI>GOD,</HI> and of an immortal <HI>Soul,</HI> in the pursuance of it. Thou shalt quickly take an everlasting <HI>Farewel</HI> of all this World; <HI>This World</HI> will not stand thee in any stead ere long, when thy Soul, thy <HI>Soul</HI> shall be trembling on thy cold lips, just ready (as the Atheist said) to <HI>Take a great leap in the Dark.</HI> Yea, That very Day, wherein thou goest a|broad without thy <HI>Family Prayers,</HI> may prove
<PB N="37" REF="000487_0045_0FA672715EBFE320">
the very Day, wherein an Angry God may say, <HI>This day shall thy soul be required of thee.</HI> And what a phrensy is this? To be extreme busy &amp; earnest about the trifles of <HI>this</HI> word, while a precious never-dying <HI>soul</HI> is unprovided for? I wish that all <HI>Prayerless Houses,</HI> had this Admoni|tion engraved on their walls. <HI>What is a man</HI> profited, <HI>if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</HI> Could you see it engraved on those <HI>walls,</HI> with an Hand writing, like what <HI>Belshaz|zer</HI> saw of old, it would no doubt amaze and startle you. Look into these leaves, and see it with a <HI>sha</HI>rp <HI>Style</HI> engraven here! Besides. <HI>Fa|mily Prayers</HI> are no real prejudice to <HI>Sacular Af|fairs.</HI> They should not be Long, Tedious, Bur|densome; and they'le <HI>hinder no Journey,</HI> no con|cern; all will prosper the better for them.

<HEAD>The Second Excuse.</HEAD>
<P>Another man doth so excuse himself, <HI>I want</HI> Confidence <HI>for Family prayer; I would</HI> pray, <HI>but I am</HI> Asham'd.</P>
<P>This Excuse is little better, To be ashamed of <HI>Prayer</HI> is to be ashamed of Christ: And it is the plain Word of our Lord JESUS in
<PB N="38" REF="000487_0046_0FA672723363DA70">
Marc. 8. 38. <HI>Whosoever shall be ashamed of me, of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed.</HI> O direful Doom!

Never be asham'd of <HI>Pray|er,</HI> but be asham'd of <HI>sin;</HI> tis a <HI>sin</HI> to live with|out <HI>prayer.</HI> If you have any <HI>Scoffers</HI> in your Houses, whom tis not fit you should pray before, then do as <HI>Abraham</HI> did; e'en, <HI>Turn 'em out of the doors.</HI> Better Turn <HI>them</HI> out, than Turn <HI>God</HI> out.

<P N="3">III. To propound some <HI>Incentives</HI> unto <HI>family Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>And there are cheefly Two Considerations which I have to set before you.</P>
<P>Consider, first, the Direful &amp; grievous <HI>Curses</HI> which prayerless Families are exposed unto. Such <HI>Families,</HI> they are the very <HI>Suburbs</HI> of <HI>He</HI> it self. A <HI>Prison.</HI> A <HI>Dungeon,</HI> is to be chosen before a Living in them. There is a Word, an awful Word, which a Prophet of God has written in a certain place; Methinks, that Word falls like a Thunderbolt of Death upon the <HI>Fami|lies,</HI> in which God is not prayed unto: tis Written in Jer. 10. 25. <HI>O Lord,&mdash;pour our thy</HI> fury <HI>on the beathen, which know thee not; on the</HI> Families <HI>which call not on thy name.</HI> Strikes it not cold unto the heart of the Reader? Man, These are the Ireful and the direful words of the Lord Jesus Christ himself: He counts thy <HI>Prayerless Family</HI> no better than a <HI>Pagan Family.</HI> And now, he speaks not as an <HI>Advocate</HI> for thy poor <HI>Family;</HI> He saies not, <HI>Lord, vouchsafe thy</HI> Pitty, <HI>and thy</HI> pardon <HI>to that Family;</HI> But He saies, <HI>Lord,</HI> Pour <HI>out thy</HI> fury <HI>upon that family, because it calls not on thy Name.</HI> Alas, have you no more Kindness for your <HI>Families,</HI> than to lay them open to the <HI>Fury</HI> of a great and a terri|ble GOD? <HI>cruel people,</HI> that you are. We

read in <HI>Zech.</HI> 5. begin about a <HI>Flying Roll</HI> Twenty Cubits <HI>long,</HI> Ten Cubits <HI>broad,</HI> entring into these and those <HI>Houses, to consume them.</HI> I am to tell you. That <HI>Prayerless Houses</HI> are to feel the force of this <HI>Flying Roll.</HI> An huge <HI>Roll</HI> of <HI>Curses</HI> belongs to that <HI>House</HI> in which <HI>Prayer</HI> is not upheld. The <HI>Curse</HI> of God is the Sauce in every <HI>Dish,</HI> the <HI>Curse</HI> of God is the Cover to every <HI>Bed,</HI> in that lamentable <HI>Family.</HI> Houses molested with <HI>Devils,</HI> are not more miserable that Houses destitute of <HI>Prayers.</HI> I have seen it in an house, where the <HI>Devils</HI> have had Possessi|on of a Child, that when <HI>Family-Prayer</HI> began, the <HI>Devils</HI> would make hideous Roarings and Noises in the Room, as being under a Vexation thereat, which was intolerable to them. Truly The Devils have <HI>no</HI> Disturbance in Houses where <HI>Family-prayer</HI> is not maintained; <HI>prayerless</HI> houses are <HI>haunted</HI> houses, and the Fiends of Darkness feign, and ramp, there without Controul. In|deed, <HI>Prayerless Families,</HI> are not only the <HI>Ca|ges, </HI> but also the <HI>Causes</HI> of all Impiety. They bring an Irresistible Deluge of Disorder upon all the Town and Land; and cause all the Countrey to swarm with the <HI>workers of iniquity who call not upon the Lord.</HI> And as the <HI>Prayer|less Householder</HI> is now <HI>cursed</HI> by God, so he will one day be cursed by all his <HI>House;</HI> he <HI>brings</HI> curses on them, and they will <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> curses on him. In the Day of Vengeance. In the ever|burning
<PB N="42" REF="000487_0050_0FA67276B4AD90B0">
lake, they will <HI>curse</HI> the day that ever they saw thy <HI>prayerless house,</HI> and, <HI>That</HI> House <HI>brought me to this Hell!</HI> This, this will be their Cry world without End.</P>
<P>Consider, next, the marvellous <HI>Blessings</HI> which belong to all <HI>Praying Families.</HI> It was noted a|bout the Family of <HI>Obed-Edom,</HI> in 1. Sam. 6. 11. <HI>The Lord blessed</HI> Obed-Edom <HI>and his household,</HI> while the <HI>Ark of the Lord</HI> was there. So shall it be noted-about the Family of a <HI>praying House|holder;</HI> The Lord will <HI>bless that man and his Household,</HI> while that <HI>Prayer to the Lord</HI> is there. <HI>Family-prayers,</HI> are <HI>conjoined</HI> prayers, and <HI>united</HI> prayers; thus they become very <HI>successful</HI> pray|ers. What Encouragement is there given to them, in that promise, Matth. 18. 19. <HI>If two of you shall agree on earth, touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them.</HI> O let your Families <HI>Agree</HI> in the Asking of <HI>grace,</HI> in the Asking of <HI>glory,</HI> in the Asking of every <HI>good thing; Prayer in Consort,</HI> will obtain it all. When <HI>Cornelius</HI> was at his <HI>Family-prayers,</HI> what a signal favour did the Almighty God show unto him? Some while since, a whole Town in <HI>Swit|zerland</HI> was very suddenly destroyed by an <HI>Earth-quake,</HI> all except one peice of an house, in which a good man happned then to be at <HI>Prayer</HI> with his <HI>Family.</HI> Tis impossible to tell, <HI>O how great is the goodness</HI> which God has laid up for Houses that seek unto Him! But besides all the
<PB N="43" REF="000487_0051_0FA672791663F6D0">
other comforts of a <HI>praying Householder,</HI> he has <HI>This</HI> peculiar to him, <HI>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eacheth all his Family to.</HI> A praying <HI>Parent</HI> will have praying <HI>chil|dren. David</HI> prayed in his Family, and his Son <HI>Solomon</HI> Prov'd a praying young man. A praying <HI>Master</HI> will have praying <HI>Servants. A|braham</HI> pray'd in his Family, and his Man <HI>Elie|zer</HI> became a very praying person. Thus, O man, all thy <HI>young people,</HI> will be filling every corner of thy house with <HI>Prayer</HI> for thy Felicity.</P>
<P>O consider of these things; and such let the Impression of them upon you be; That you may by <HI>Prayers</HI> with your <HI>Families</HI> Engage your <HI>Houses</HI> to <HI>serve the Lord.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>To offer some Directions about Family-Instruction.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Directions</HI> to be given hereabout, may be referr'd unto two Heads.</P>
<P>First, The <HI>Matter</HI> of Family Instruction.</P>
<P>The <HI>Family-instruction,</HI> with which we urge
<PB N="45" REF="000487_0053_0FA6727B57364E78">
our houses to the Service of God, are to have no less than Four things composing of it.</P>
<P>First, There are Holy <HI>Lessons,</HI> with which we are to <HI>Instruct</HI> our <HI>Families.</HI> We are to make them <HI>hear,</HI> and make them <HI>learn</HI> those <HI>Lessons,</HI> which may <HI>give to the young ones Knowledge and Discretion.</HI> Teach them the <HI>Scriptures</HI> of Truth. Twas said to <HI>Timothy,</HI> in Cap. 3. 15. <HI>From a</HI> Child <HI>thou hast known the Holy Scriptures;</HI> No doubt, his Godly Mother and Grandmother were the cause of his doing so. We should procure that our <HI>Young</HI> ones may <HI>read</HI> the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> and <HI>mind</HI> the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> and <HI>know</HI> the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> even <HI>from a Child.</HI> Let them have by hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, here and there a <HI>Verse,</HI> or a <HI>Para|graph;</HI> Especially in the <HI>Psalms</HI> and in the <HI>Pro|verbs:</HI> if you would have them <HI>good,</HI> teach them the <HI>Psalmes</HI> of <HI>David;</HI> if you would have them <HI>wise,</HI> teach them the <HI>Proverbs</HI> of <HI>Solomon.</HI> And Scripture-<HI>Stories</HI> are to be told unto them, as soon as ever they enquire after <HI>new</HI> things and <HI>strange.</HI></P>
<P>But while we do thus, we are also to teach them the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of God. Inculcate upon them the <HI>Principles of Religion,</HI> as often as you do the Knife on the Stone in the <HI>Whetting</HI> of it. Twas said unto the Lord Jesus, in Matth. 22. 16. <HI>Master, Thou teachest the way of God in Truth.</HI> Every <HI>Master</HI> should render his <HI>young</HI> ones able to say that unto himself, <HI>Master, Thou
<PB N="46" REF="000487_0054_0FA6727C30FA8B30">
teachest the Truth of God.</HI> Especially, We should be sure that they be not ignorant of any <HI>Saving</HI> Truths. Tell them, What they <HI>are</HI> come to by the <HI>First Adam,</HI> and what they <HI>may</HI> come to by the <HI>Second Adam.</HI> Tell them what <HI>Covenant</HI> man was once, and What Covenant man is <HI>now</HI> to be saved by. Yea, let none of the Things to be <HI>believed,</HI> none of the Things to be <HI>practised,</HI> none of the Things to be <HI>pray'd for</HI> be left unmentioned in your instructions. All the <HI>Lessons</HI> of the <HI>Creed,</HI> the <HI>Commandments,</HI> and the <HI>Lords Prayer</HI> are to be laid before them. And we are to be particularly faithful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> in the <HI>present Truths;</HI> the <HI>labouring</HI> Truths, the <HI>witnessed</HI> Truths of the Times, we should see our young ones well informed in. Give them <HI>at this day</HI> to be sensible, who is the Supreme <HI>Head,</HI> and <HI>King</HI> of the Church, and what <HI>Orders</HI> He has appointed to be observed there.</P>
<P>Secondly. There are serious <HI>Questions</HI> with which we are to <HI>Instruct</HI> our <HI>Families.</HI> And there are peculiarly Two Things which we are to <HI>question</HI> our young ones about.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Questions</HI> we are to put unto them,</P>
<P>First, Which Concern their <HI>Souls.</HI></P>
<P>And here, yet further to particularize, We are to try them with <HI>Questions</HI> about their <HI>Under|standing.</HI> Our Lord Jesus asked his Disciples, in Matth. 13. 51. <HI>Have ye</HI> understood <HI>all these things?</HI> Thus are we to ask our young people,
<PB N="47" REF="000487_0055_0FA6727CB727D3C8">
<HI>Do you</HI> understand <HI>the great Mystery of Godliness&punc;</HI> O keep up the great Ordinance of <HI>Catechising</HI> in your houses. Before your little Folks have left off liying upon <HI>Milk,</HI> let them be so well vers|ed in their <HI>Milk for Babes,</HI> that they may readi|ly answer any Question there. The <HI>Echoes</HI> of this Exercise, are a most refreshing Melody in the ears of God himself. Ask we our young ones, What they think of <HI>God,</HI> and of <HI>Christ,</HI> and of <HI>Themselves;</HI> and let them he able to re|sound the <HI>Words of Truth.</HI></P>
<P>We are to search them also with <HI>Questions</HI> a|bout their <HI>Experience.</HI> As our Lord asked His Family, in Joh. 16. 31. <HI>Do ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> believe?</HI> So should we ask our young people, <HI>Have you</HI> Experienced <HI>a work of</HI> Regeneration <HI>in your souls?</HI> Ask them, <HI>Have you ever yet carried a labouring and heavy-laden soul unto the Lord Jesus Christ?</HI> It was the Advice of Wisdom, <HI>Know the state of thy Flocks.</HI> Thus, we should endeavour to <HI>know the state of the Souls</HI> which we are to be concern|ed for; to <HI>know</HI> whether they are in a <HI>Natural,</HI> or a <HI>Renewed</HI> state.</P>
<P>Once more, We are to help them with <HI>Quest|ions</HI> about their <HI>Temptations.</HI> It was a <HI>Question</HI> once given to some, in Luc. 24. 38. <HI>Why do Thoughts arise in your hearts?</HI> Even so we should Enquire of our young people, <HI>What</HI> Thoughts <HI>are you most troubled with?</HI> Enquire, what <HI>Fears,</HI> enquire what <HI>Snares</HI> they are most endangered

by. Be alwaies jealous, lest <HI>as the serpent beguil|ed Eve,</HI> so their <HI>minds be corrupted.</HI> Moreover Some <HI>Questions</HI> we are to put upon them, Se|condly, which concern their <HI>Lives.</HI> It was once an Interrogatory which some were put un|to, in Luc. 23. 17. <HI>What manner of communi|cations have ye?</HI> Thus we are to Examine our young people about the <HI>Words</HI> and the <HI>Works,</HI> that fill their Lives. There are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> three things which they should be Examined about; their <HI>Prayer,</HI> their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">me,</HI> and their <HI>Company.</HI> Ask them, whether they live without <HI>Prayer</HI> or no? Whether in Prayer they secretly and sin|cerely pour out their souls before the Lord? Ask them, How they spend their <HI>time?</HI> How much <HI>Idle Time,</HI> and how much <HI>useful</HI> Time they allow unto themselves? And ask them. What their <HI>Company</HI> is? Whom they sit withal? Whether <HI>vain Persons</HI> and <HI>Fools,</HI> or <HI>the Saints which are the excellent,</HI> and <HI>all those that fear God?</HI> Our Question will prove their <HI>Safeguard,</HI> if it be well administred.</P>
<P>Thirdly, There are faithful <HI>Reproofs</HI> with which we are to <HI>Instruct</HI> our <HI>Families.</HI> Tis said in Prov. 6. 33. <HI>The</HI> Reproofs <HI>of Instruction are the way of life.</HI> When we give <HI>Instruction,</HI> we shall have occasion to give <HI>Reproof,</HI> too often with it. There is no <HI>Family</HI> that has not Miscarri|ages that are to be <HI>reproved</HI> in it. <HI>Young</HI> peo|ple too commonly are <HI>wild</HI> people; and with|out
<PB N="49" REF="000487_0057_0FA6727E3B4850B8">
some <HI>Castigations</HI> they will rarely be kept in order. To some of them smart <HI>Words,</HI> to others of them smart <HI>Blowes,</HI> will be too of|ten due. Tis said in Prov. 13. 24. <HI>He that spareth his Rod hateth his son; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e that loveth him, chastens him betimes. Frowns</HI> are due to all, and <HI>Rods</HI> to some Transgressors in the family. But there are two Negative and two Positive Rules to be minded in <HI>Reproving</HI> of them.</P>
<P>The Negative Rules are these two.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Reprove</HI> not <HI>Furiously.</HI> It is said in <HI>Jam.</HI> 1. 20. <HI>The wrath of man, worketh not the righ|teousness of God.</HI> Remember, Nothing will be so well done <HI>in</HI> a passion, but what may be done better <HI>out</HI> of it. If you are to <HI>chide,</HI> yet chide not in a <HI>Fury.</HI> Do not call <HI>vile Names;</HI> much more, do not <HI>swear,</HI> do not <HI>curse,</HI> do'not Rage with a <HI>Tongue set on fire of hell.</HI> If you are to <HI>smite,</HI> yet smite not in a <HI>Fury.</HI> Bloody, wound|ing, outragious Buffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tings are to be avoided, lest there be cause to say of you, <HI>Curs|ed is their Anger for it is fierce, and their Wrath for it is cruel.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly <HI>Reprove</HI> not <HI>for ever.</HI> Tis said in <HI>Ps.</HI> 103. 9. <HI>God will not</HI> alwaies <HI>chide, neither will He keep his anger for ever.</HI> To be <HI>alwaies</HI> finding faults, is the way <HI>never</HI> to be curing them. A <HI>perpetual Warngling</HI> is a <HI>continual Dropping,</HI> which there is no enduring of; it prejudices the minds of them that feel it, against all that shall
<PB N="50" REF="000487_0058_0FA6727EF5183578">
be said unto them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Positive</HI> Rules are these Two.</P>
<P>First, Reprove <HI>Reasonably.</HI> Let there be <HI>just</HI> Cause for it. When you <HI>reprove,</HI> it must be for a <HI>true cause.</HI> As it was said of our Saviour in <HI>Isai</HI> 11. 3. <HI>He shall not reprove after the hear|ing of His ears.</HI> Thus, we may not go by meer <HI>Hear-say,</HI> when we reprove those that are under us. And it must be for a <HI>great</HI> Cause. Tis said of the Spirit in <HI>Joh.</HI> 16. 3. <HI>He will reprove the world for SIN.</HI> The sinful thing, the thing for <HI>which the wrath of God comes,</HI> the thing which the <HI>soul of the Lord hates,</HI> this we are to reprove. We must not throw away <HI>Reproofs</HI> upon <HI>Nothing,</HI> of upon <HI>Every thing.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Reprove <HI>Scripturally.</HI> Tis said in 2. Tim 3. 16. <HI>All Scripture is profitable for Re|proof.</HI> A <HI>Reproof,</HI> with a <HI>Scripture</HI> comes with a more than ordinary Majesty and Authority. When we Reprove those that are under us, First, make them read as <HI>Text</HI> which does, Con|demn what we would rebuke, and then set it home with a very warm lively vigorous Appli|cation.</P>
<P>Fourthly, There are solemn <HI>Charges</HI> with which we are to <HI>Instruct</HI> our <HI>Families.</HI> It was the Character which the Lord gives of <HI>Abraham,</HI> in Gen 18. 19. <HI>I know him, that he will</HI> command <HI>his children and his</HI> household <HI>after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.</HI> O that this might
<PB N="51" REF="000487_0059_0FA6727FD7B65000">
be said of every <HI>Householder</HI> here; <HI>I know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that be will take all of his house, one by one, and</HI> Charge <HI>every one of them to keep the way of the Lord!</HI> What saies the Apostle, in 1 Thes. 2. 11. The charged <HI>every one of you, as a father his children.</HI> We should call aside our <HI>young</HI> people, and lay upon them, the Charge of <HI>Da|vid,</HI> in 1 Chron. 28. 9. <HI>My son, know thou the God of thy Father, and</HI> Serve Him, <HI>with a per|fect Heart and a willing mind; for the Lord search|eth all Hearts; if thou seek Him, He will be found of thee, if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee off for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Charge them; and this especially about four Things. Lay upon them that <HI>Charge</HI> of God in 1. Joh. 3. 23. <HI>This is His Commandment, that you believe on the Name of his Son.</HI> Charge them to accept of Christ Jesus, as their <HI>Prince</HI> and their <HI>Saviour;</HI> Charge them to repair unto Christ Jesus for <HI>Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctifica|tion, and Redemption.</HI> Lay also upon them that Charge of God, in Mat. 6. 6. <HI>Elder into, thy Clo|ser and pray to thy Father in secret.</HI> Charge, them to Retire for their <HI>Devotions</HI> every day; Charge them to let not a day pass them, without Crying to <HI>God</HI> for His Mercy, and pardon, and Salva|tion. Once more, Lay upon them that <HI>Charge</HI> of God. In Prov. 1. 10. <HI>My <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Sinners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thee, consent thou not,</HI> Charge them, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e not the, <HI>Companions of Fools;</HI> Charge
<PB N="52" REF="000487_0060_0FA672824874AC40">
them that they do not associate themselves into an intimacy and a Familiarity with any but such as may be sober, discreet, blameless persons, Finally, Lay upon them that <HI>Charge</HI> of God in Hag. 1. 5. <HI>Thus saith the Lord of hosts,</HI> Consi|der your waies. Charge them, that they <HI>Con|sider</HI> what their present Condition is, and what their future Condition is <HI>like</HI> to be; Charge them, that they <HI>consider</HI> of their past Behaviours, and of the <HI>Death,</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> and <HI>Eternity</HI> which is yet before them. A young man has be|come a real Convert by being obliged unto <HI>Con|sideration</HI> for one Quarter of an Hour in a Day. Wish for them, say to them, <HI>Oh that they were wise, that they would</HI> Consider! In a word, Let your Charge on them, be that, which Holy <HI>Bolton</HI> gave to his Children, when he dyed, <HI>I charge you, that at the Day of Judgements, none of you dare to meet me in an</HI> Unregenerate <HI>estate.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Manner</HI> of <HI>Family-Instruction.</HI></P>
<P>Tis to be performed in such a <HI>Manner,</HI> as may best Attain the Ends of it. Particularly.</P>
<P>First, We are to <HI>Instruct</HI> our Families very <HI>Seasonably.</HI> We are told in Matth, 24. 45. The <HI>Ruler over the Household</HI> is to <HI>give them their meat in due</HI> Season. There lies much in the <HI>Time</HI> we take for the <HI>Work.</HI> We should indeed have our <HI>Frequent</HI> Times, to do it. We should speak what may be for the <HI>Instruction</HI> for our Families,
<PB N="53" REF="000487_0061_0FA67282C1E3A480">
every day, and often in a day; and on various occasions be dropping our favoury Admonitions. Even when we sit at the <HI>Table,</HI> we should rare|ly Rise without feeding the <HI>Minds,</HI> as well as the <HI>Mouthes</HI> of our Attendents. Much more at the <HI>Hours of Prayer,</HI> we should do something that may make them more acquainted with <HI>Divine Objects</HI> than they were before. But we should likewise have our <HI>Stated</HI> Times to do it. Especially <HI>Sacred</HI> Time will be very proper|ly a <HI>Stated</HI> Time for it. On the <HI>Dayes</HI> of the Lord, we should instruct our Houses in the <HI>Things</HI> of the Lord; <HI>that</HI> were infinitely better than to be Sleeping or Talking at an idle rate, as then too many do.</P>
<P>But about the <HI>Stated Time</HI> for <HI>Family-Instructi|on</HI> there is a double Discretion to be used. It is to be dispatched in a <HI>Quiet</HI> Time, in a Time when there is no Disturbance by <HI>Passions</HI> within, or <HI>Noise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> without. It is said in Eccles. 9. 16. <HI>The words of wise men are heard in quiet:</HI> and no <HI>wise man</HI> will speak when there is not <HI>Quietness</HI> enough to allow an Audience for him. And it is to dispens'd in a <HI>Lively</HI> Time, in a Time when <HI>Spirits</HI> are stirring, and <HI>Affections</HI> are vigorous. Tis said in Rom. 12. 11. <HI>Be</HI> fervent <HI>in spirit, serving the Lord;</HI> thus, this piece of <HI>Service</HI> for the Lord, is to be done, when there is a <HI>Ferven|cy</HI> of Disposition thereunto.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="000487_0062_0FA672837167C420">
Secondly, We are to <HI>Instruct</HI> our <HI>Families</HI> ve|ry <HI>pertinently.</HI> Accommodate our <HI>Instructions</HI> to their <HI>Conditions.</HI></P>
<P>Are there any <HI>Unconverted</HI> persons in our <HI>Fa|miles?</HI> Let them <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> instructed. Say to them as in Psal. 34. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Hearken to me and I will Teach you the Fear of the Lord.</HI> Let them be <HI>war|ned</HI> of the <HI>Dangers,</HI> which do threaten their mi|serable, souls; and let them be <HI>stirred</HI> to the <HI>Duties,</HI> that may lay them at the Pool, in the <HI>way</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Are there any <HI>Converted</HI> persons, to our Fami|lies? Let <HI>them</HI> too be <HI>suitably</HI> Instructed, 'We read in Joh. 8. 31. <HI>Jesus said unto the Jewes which</HI> believed <HI>on Him,</HI> continue <HI>in my word.</HI> Let them he quickned to <HI>continue</HI> in their Faith, and Love and Zoal. Let them have <HI>Weapons</HI> to furnish them against all their Difficulties, and <HI>Cordials</HI> to Revive them under all their Dis|couragements.</P>
<P>Are there any <HI>Unfruitful</HI> Souls, in our Families? Instruct them <HI>suitably,</HI> by setting before them what is the Doom of the Barren <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rce,</HI> and of the, Barren <HI>Ground;</HI> even to be <HI>out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> and <HI>burnt up</HI> for ever. And say, <HI>O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your heavenly Fa|ther by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> forth much fruit.</HI></P>
<P>Are there any <HI>Back-s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iding</HI> Souls, in our Fa|milies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Instruct them <HI>suitably,</HI> by serving be|fore them the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> sure</HI> of God at such as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> and His extreme Wrath on them whose

<P>Thirdly. We are to <HI>Instruct</HI> our Families ve|ry <HI>Diligently.</HI> Tis a thing that we are to <HI>labour</HI> in.

Let our <HI>Walk,</HI> as well as our <HI>Talk,</HI> show the young people with us how they are <HI>to walk and to please God;</HI> and let us be able to call upon them, <HI>Do you follow me, as I follow Christ.</HI> Let us give such Expressions of <HI>Love</HI> to God and his <HI>Truths</HI> and His <HI>Wayes,</HI> that our Families may come after us in the like. Let them discern how to seek the <HI>Face</HI> of God, and how to bear the <HI>Hand</HI> of God, and how to Prize the <HI>Word</HI> of God, by seeing how <HI>We</HI> do it our selves.

<P>Fifthly.

<P>The Blessed God affordeth to men in this World a <HI>Time</HI> to discharge the Duties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on them. There are two things incumbent on us; to <HI>Do</HI> good, and to <HI>Get</HI> good. The good we are to <HI>do,</HI> is to <HI>Honour</HI> God; and the good we are to <HI>get,</HI> is to <HI>Enjoy</HI> God Those two things comprise all our <HI>Duties;</HI> and they make up the <HI>Errand</HI> which we come into the World upon Now, while we are in this world, God allowes us a <HI>Time</HI> for this work; we have <HI>time</HI> not only in the larger sense of it, but also in the stricter sense of it: We have <HI>time</HI> not only in <HI>Duration,</HI> but also in <HI>Opportunity.</HI> There is not any <HI>Duty</HI> enjoined up|pon us, but there is a <HI>Season</HI> for it allowed un|to us. Tis an Observation about the things that <HI>shall</HI> be, in Eccles 3. 1. <HI>To every thing there is a</HI> Season, <HI>and a</HI> Time <HI>to every purpose.</HI> Thus it may be said about the thing, that <HI>should</HI> be, <HI>There is no</HI> Duty, <HI>but God hath provided us a</HI> Time <HI>and a</HI> Season <HI>for it.</HI> We have some <HI>golden spots of Time,</HI> whereof we may say, <HI>This is the</HI>

Time <HI>for such a duty; and again, This is the</HI> Time <HI>for another duty.</HI></P>
<P>First, We have a <HI>Time</HI> to <HI>do Good</HI> while we are here in the world. We have a <HI>time</HI> to ex|ercise every <HI>Vertue,</HI> to use all that <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> all that <HI>Holiness</HI> &amp; <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which the Lord requireth of us.

<HEAD>Prop. II.</HEAD>
<P>It is no small part of <HI>Wisdom</HI> for men to <HI>dis|cern</HI> and <HI>improve</HI> the <HI>Time</HI> which God affordeth unto them. When the Gales of <HI>Opportunity</HI> blow in the Sails of <HI>Time,</HI> every man should see and watch his own <HI>Opportunity.</HI> To <HI>Discern</HI> the Time, is to <HI>mind</HI> the time, and to <HI>use</HI> the time for the performance of our <HI>Duty.</HI> Now tis a <HI>wise</HI> man that will so <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> the <HI>Time. Sapience</HI> or <HI>Wisdom</HI> is a Vertue of the <HI>Understanding,</HI> whereby a man perceives the <HI>Dependence</HI> of things; the <HI>Connexion</HI>of things, and the <HI>Con|sequence of things</HI> understood, therein <HI>Wis|dom</HI> is discovered. To <HI>discern the time</HI> is an in|stance of this. Tis <HI>Wisdom</HI> for a man to lay his <HI>Time</HI> and his <HI>Work</HI> together. Tis <HI>Wisdom</HI> for a man to fore-see what will be the Issue of such a <HI>Work</HI> at such a <HI>Time.</HI> But besides the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Wisdom</HI> evidently appearing in this thing, we have a two-fold further witness to the <HI>Wisdom.</HI> of it.</P>
<P>First, The <HI>Testimony</HI> of <HI>Scripture</HI> there about shewes, that it is <HI>Wisdome</HI> for men to <HI>discern</HI> and <HI>improve</HI> their <HI>time.</HI> What the all-<HI>wise,</HI> the only-<HI>wise</HI> GOD calleth <HI>Wisdom,</HI> is unquestionably to be esteemed so. The <HI>Redeeming</HI> of <HI>Time</HI> is great Wisdom in the Language and the Account of God. Twas said in Eph. 5. 16. <HI>Walk as</HI> wise, Redeeming <HI>the time</HI>&mdash;Much of the same <HI>Date</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="000487_0078_0FA672956C16C610">
and <HI>Tenour,</HI> was the Epistle to the <HI>Colossians.</HI> In that Epistle also we have the like passage, in Cap. 4. 5. <HI>Walk in</HI> Wisdom, Redeeming <HI>the time,</HI> Tis probable the Apostle therein has a special Reference to Persecutions, which good men were then exposed unto. To <HI>Redeem the Time,</HI> was a proverbial Phrase of old, signify|ing, To <HI>Keep out of trouble as long as one can.</HI> Thus the <HI>Chaldean.</HI> Soothsayers were told in their distress, <HI>Dan. 2. 8. I know that ye would</HI> gain <HI>the time.</HI> This was the Counsil of the Apostle, <HI>By a prudent, holy, careful, and inoffensive Carri|age towards them that would interrupt you in the worship of Jesus Christ,</HI> gain Time <HI>what you can for the quiet practice of it.</HI> Well, If it be <HI>Wis|dom</HI> to <HI>gain</HI> time <HI>for</HI> the Service of God, surely, tis Wisdom to <HI>Spend</HI> time <HI>in</HI> the Service of God. It was the Singular Character &amp; Commendation of the <HI>Issacharites,</HI> in 1. Chron. 12. 32. <HI>They had</HI> Understanding <HI>in the</HI> times, <HI>to</HI> know <HI>what Is|rael ought to do.</HI> Tis an <HI>understanding</HI> man, who doth so <HI>know</HI> his <HI>Time,</HI> as to <HI>do</HI> his <HI>Work.</HI> Or a <HI>Time-losing</HI> man, the Scripture faith, <HI>He is a Fool.</HI> It saies in Prov. 18. 16. <HI>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a</HI> Fool?</P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Prevention</HI> of <HI>Sorrow</HI> thereby, shewes, That it is <HI>Wisdom</HI> for men to <HI>discern</HI> and <HI>improve</HI> their <HI>Time.</HI> It is great <HI>Wisdom</HI> to prevent great <HI>Sorrow.</HI> Now nothing in the world fills the heart of man more with Anguish
<PB N="71" REF="000487_0079_0FA672961D2C79B0">
and Anger, than the <HI>Missing</HI> of Time. When a man has missed his <HI>Time</HI> for his <HI>Work,</HI> it caus|eth an unspeakable Regret within him. We read of some professors, who missed their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to Entertain Christ Jesus and His Mercy: with what a marvellous Agony did they cry out, in <HI>Matth.</HI> 25. 11. <HI>Lord, Lord, open to us!</HI> Well might they be called <HI>Foolish,</HI> who thus came too late. The horrour of it being once only Re|presented by some profane people, who acted the <HI>Foolish Virgins</HI> in a Play, at a City in <HI>Germany,</HI> it even kill'd a Prince that was a Spectator of it, Tis impossible to utter the Confusion which the slipping of <HI>time</HI> does put the souls of men into. When <HI>Esau</HI> had missed his <HI>Time</HI> to procure a Blessing for himself, how did he resent it? We are told in Gen. 27. 34. <HI>He cry'd with a</HI> great <HI>and</HI> exceeding bitter <HI>Cry.</HI> Alas, how should is be otherwise? The slipping of <HI>Time</HI> is an <HI>Ill, and an</HI> exceeding bitter <HI>thing.</HI> There are but two sorts of men; both of them find the <HI>Loss of time,</HI> to prove at some time or other, a sad, an evil, a troublesome thing unto them, 'Tis thus especially when their time is come to <HI>Dy,</HI> when their time is to <HI>be no more.</HI> As for <HI>Good men,</HI> the <HI>Loss of time</HI> usually strowes <HI>Thorns</HI> on their <HI>Beds</HI> when they come to dy. It grieves the best man to think, My Time, <HI>my</HI> Time, <HI>I have not so laid it out for God as I should have done.</HI> He was a painful &amp; a pious Minister of the Gos|pel

who yet breathed out this among his last Groans, <HI>O the Loss</HI> of Time!<HI> it sits heavy on my spirit now.</HI> As for <HI>Bad men,</HI> the <HI>Loss of Time</HI> flashes Hell fire into their spirits when they come to Dy. It causes terrible wounds and pains in the departing soul of a Sinner to think <HI>I had once a</HI> Time to <HI>Believe, a</HI> Time <HI>to Repent, a</HI> Time <HI>to lay up for Eternity, but now my</HI> Time is gone <HI>for ever.</HI> The shriek of a poor man going our of the world sometimes has been, A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">world<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for an in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o of Time.

<P>Let us <HI>discern</HI> three things in <HI>all</HI> Time, and permit <HI>no</HI> Time to be devoured by two things which we may be under Temptation to.</P>
<P>The things which we are to discern in <HI>all</HI> Time are these,</P>

the <HI>damned</HI> set on their Time.

<P>Let us <HI>Discern</HI> our <HI>Time,</HI> and Attend <HI>every Du|ty</HI> in the <HI>proper Time.</HI></P>
<P>There is a two-fold <HI>Prudence</HI> which the <HI>Wise man's heart</HI> is to be no stranger to.</P>
<P>The First <HI>Prudence is,</HI></P>
<P>Let no <HI>Duty</HI> be done out of its <HI>Time.</HI> We are told in Eccles. 3. 11. <HI>God hath made every thing beautiful in the</HI> Time <HI>of it.</HI> There is a <HI>Nick</HI> of <HI>Time</HI> that we are to take for all we do. Not <HI>Snow</HI> but <HI>Fruit</HI> is <HI>beautiful</HI> in the Summer. Tis
<PB N="78" REF="000487_0086_0FA672A0DE89DF00">
not beautiful for the Duty of <HI>Prayer,</HI> to be done at a <HI>sleepy</HI> time, or at a <HI>busy</HI> time. Tis not <HI>beau|tiful</HI> for the Duty of <HI>Reproof</HI> to be done at a <HI>time</HI> when it can do no <HI>good</HI> at all. Set not upon this or that Duty at a time when God calls to <HI>another</HI> Duty. Tis said in Eccles. 8. 6. <HI>To every pur|pose there is a</HI> Time <HI>and Judgement.</HI> We may render all our Duties like <HI>Apples of gold in pictures of silver,</HI> by well <HI>timing</HI> of them.</P>
<P>The Second <HI>Prudence is,</HI></P>
<P>Let no <HI>Time</HI> pass away without its <HI>Duty:</HI> Let none of our <HI>times</HI> be unaccompanied with the <HI>Du|ties</HI> which belong unto them. As now, there are <HI>Duties</HI> that belong to a time of <HI>Prosperity,</HI> and <HI>Duties</HI> which belong to a Time of <HI>Adversity.</HI></P>
<P>Tis said in <HI>Eccles.</HI> 7. 14. <HI>In the day of</HI> Prospe|rity <HI>be</HI> joyful, <HI>but in the day of</HI> Adversity Consi|der. In a time of <HI>Prosperity:</HI> now is a time for men to <HI>Remember</HI> their <HI>Creator before the</HI> evil <HI>days come;</HI> Now is a <HI>time</HI> for men to <HI>set their heart and their soul to</HI> seek the Lord <HI>who hath given them rest on every side.</HI> In a time of <HI>Adversity,</HI> now is a <HI>time</HI> for men to bring <HI>sin to remembrance;</HI> now is a time for men to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Lord</HI> in all the ways of Repentance and Obedience. This is to <HI>Discern the Time.</HI> But there are especially three sorts of times which we are to fill with the <HI>Du|tyes</HI> of those <HI>Times.</HI></P>
<P>First. Let the Dutyes of <HI>Worshipping times,</HI> be done in those times. We have our <HI>times</HI> every
<PB N="79" REF="000487_0087_0FA672A32EBE7228">
day wherein the Lord saith, <HI>seek my Face.</HI> Now let the <HI>Echo</HI> of our souls be that in Psal. 27. 8. <HI>Thy Face, Lord, we will seek.</HI> We have every day our <HI>times</HI> for private Prayer, our <HI>times</HI> for secret Prayer, our times for Reading <HI>of,</HI> and Thinking <HI>on</HI> the Word of God. Let those things be faithfully done in those Times.</P>
<P>Especially, <HI>Remember the Sabbath Day.</HI> Let <HI>Sabbath-</HI>time be <HI>sanctifyed</HI> time. On this day, ly all the day long at the <HI>pool</HI> of Mercy; <HI>Mercy, Mercy,</HI> and Salvation for an immortal soul is this day to be traded for. Tis a <HI>Time</HI> that the great God is very Jealous about. He does won|derfully curse the <HI>Souls,</HI> and blast the <HI>Houses,</HI> and ruin the <HI>Countryes</HI> where this Holy <HI>Time</HI> is not acknowledged. He will terribly break the <HI>rest</HI> of those whom His <HI>Rest</HI> shall not be regar|ded by.</P>
<P>Secondly, Let the Dutyes of <HI>Visiting</HI> Times be done in those <HI>Times,</HI> Tis too commonly seen that <HI>Amici tempar is Fures;</HI> our <HI>Friends</HI> are our <HI>Theeves;</HI> they <HI>Steal</HI> our <HI>time,</HI> because we don't <HI>use</HI> our time, when then they are with us. Tis observable, in <HI>Col.</HI> 4. 6. as soon as the Apo|stle had said, <HI>Redeem the time,</HI> he adds, <HI>Let your speech be always with Grace.</HI> That, that indeed is a rare way to <HI>Redeem</HI> the <HI>time.</HI> Let us ordina|rily study to do some good, whatever Company we come into. It was observed of that excel|lent <HI>Ursin</HI> by his renowned Friend, <HI>I never was

<P>Thirdly, Let the Duties of <HI>Intervening</HI> times be done in those <HI>times.</HI> We have large <HI>Frag|ments</HI> of time, that are the Intervals of our bu|sinesses; about these Fragments of <HI>time,</HI> I would say as our <HI>L</HI>ord said about the Fragments of <HI>Bread,</HI> in Joh. 6. 12. <HI>Gather up those</HI> Fragments <HI>that nothing be lost.</HI> How many thousands of happy thoughts might we have as we are sitting in the <HI>House,</HI> or walking in the <HI>Street,</HI> other|wise wholly unimployed?

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="direction">
<HEAD>Direction. III.</HEAD>
<P>Let us <HI>discern</HI> our <HI>Time,</HI> and make none but <HI>Good Bargams</HI> about the time. The Scripture once and again tells us, as in <HI>Eph.</HI> 5. 16. that we are to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uy up</HI> the time, or <HI>buy out</HI> the time.

Many things must we <HI>give up,</HI> that our time so may be well imployed. The case is ordinarily
<PB N="81" REF="000487_0089_0FA672A45B5DA550">
so, that either we must resign many <HI>Pleasures,</HI> many <HI>Profits,</HI> many <HI>Honours,</HI> or else we must part with our <HI>time</HI> Now rather <HI>give up</HI> all Delights, than suffer precious time to be pyrat|ed away. All the things <HI>of</HI> time, are sometimes Expence little enough <HI>for</HI> time. Yea, many things must we give <HI>back,</HI> that so we may not misemploy our time. The <HI>Devil</HI> and our <HI>Lusts</HI> have been trucking for our <HI>time.</HI> The Devil, that hellish Hucster, would engross all our <HI>Time</HI> for his own. He deals with us as the <HI>Europeans</HI> dealt at first with the filly <HI>Indians</HI> who lett go their <HI>Gold,</HI> and <HI>Silver,</HI> and <HI>Diamonds</HI> for <HI>glass-Beads</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">insul-Toyes.</HI> The Answer that our <HI>Lust</HI> makes to the Tempter i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, <HI>Let me have</HI> the pleasures of sin for a season, <HI>and every season of my</HI> time <HI>shall be thine.</HI> O but we should be content to <HI>give back</HI> all that Satan has proffer'd us for our time; let it be never-so-much that we might have had for the <HI>misuse of time,</HI> be|grutch it not. 'Twas the Speech of <HI>Austin Perde aliquid at Deo vaces</HI> If you would have Time for <HI>God,</HI> or any Good, you must part with something for it.</P>
<P>In a Word, Let us labour now to <HI>Regain</HI> the <HI>Time</HI> that we have been cheated of. The cheef way to do that, is, <HI>By a</HI> double <HI>Diligence for the time to come.

<P>First, The <HI>Merciful</HI> Dispensations of God, are <HI>Trials</HI> of us: these are Trials on the <HI>Right</HI> hand. It is a sacred Proverb, in <HI>Prov.</HI> 27. 21. <HI>As the Fining-pot for silver, and the Furnace for Gold, so is a man to his praise;</HI> or <HI>so the mouth which praises any one, is to</HI> try <HI>him.</HI> As when a man is <HI>praised</HI> by his Neighbour, so when a man is <HI>Blessed</HI> of his Maker, he is then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the utmost. <HI>Ho|nours</HI> from below, do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> they soon <HI>Try</HI> &amp; <HI>show</HI> the man that is perfumed there with; and the same is done by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from above.

They are so many Trials, <HI>Whether we will hear God speaking to us in our prosperity;</HI> or <HI>whether when we wax fat, we shall kick against the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>Afflictive</HI> Dispensations of God, are likewise <HI>Tryals</HI> of us. And these are Trials on the <HI>Left hand.</HI> So much is intimated in 1. Pet. 1. 6, 7. <HI>Ye are in heaviness thro' many</HI> Temp|tations, <HI>that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than that of gold which perisheth, though it be tried with fire, may be found unto praise.</HI> All <HI>Afflictions</HI> are <HI>Tentations;</HI> by them we are <HI>tried</HI> whether we have the Grace of God in us or no. Tis <HI>Faith,</HI> but not Faith <HI>alone,</HI> which our <HI>Trou|bles</HI> here are the <HI>Trials</HI> of. A <HI>Sick-bed</HI> is a <HI>Flu|ence,</HI> a <HI>Reproach</HI> is a <HI>Furnace,</HI> a <HI>Loss,</HI> or a <HI>Good</HI> is a <HI>Furnace,</HI> in which tis <HI>tried</HI> whether we have the spirits, not of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> stands,</HI> but of <HI>Children</HI> in us.

<P><PB N="90" REF="000487_0098_0FA672B1B1F5B028">
Upon the <HI>Trials</HI> of God, good men <HI>come forth as gold.</HI></P>
<P>There is that in <HI>Gold,</HI> which good men may be compar'd unto. We read in Deut. 1. 1. about the mountains of <HI>Dizahab:</HI> that is, the <HI>Golden</HI> mountains; because <HI>Gold</HI> was probably dug from thence. The <HI>Churches</HI> of God in the world, are such <HI>Mountains</HI> of gold. Every true Believer is a rich lump of <HI>Gold</HI> before the Lord. Of such persons tis said in Lam. 4. 2. <HI>They are the precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine</HI> gold. There are diverse properties in <HI>Gold,</HI> which a good man will have a blessed Resemblance of. I should offer you not <HI>Gold,</HI> but <HI>Hay</HI> and <HI>stubble</HI> if I should read you here a <HI>Lecture of Metallogy,</HI> or discourse to you all that I could Philosophize about this King of <HI>Metals.</HI> Let me only touch on a few common Reflections, As now,</P>
<P><HI>Gold</HI> is a <HI>pure</HI> metal. Hence we read near some scores of times in the sacred Scripture, a|bout <HI>pure Gold.</HI> It will not readily admit a Mix|ture or an Alloy with more imperfect Metals; unless with <HI>Silver:</HI> Especially the <HI>Dust-gold</HI> of <HI>Guined,</HI> Gold whereof <HI>Job</HI> faith tis <HI>Dust of gold:</HI> wonderful is the <HI>Purity</HI> thereof! Thus a good man is a <HI>pure</HI> man; He is one of those that are called in <HI>Matth.</HI> 5. 8. <HI>The pure in heart:</HI> He is <HI>pure</HI> in his <HI>Ends, pure</HI> from the dross of <HI>Lust:</HI> and he is not so much <HI>Nominally</HI> as really, <HI>A Puritan.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="000487_0099_0FA672B2E7CC27F8">
Again, Gold is a <HI>Ductil</HI> Metal. Tis marvel|lously extensible when beaten into Leaves; twere incredible to tell how far one Grain of <HI>Gold</HI> may be extended and continued. So dense and com|pacted, and united, are the parts of it, that an Ounce of it may be beaten (I suppose) into a Thousand Leaves. Thus a good Man can be <HI>Drawn forth</HI> into large Expressions of goodness and vertue. It was said by such an one in Psal. 11. 3. <HI>My goodness Extendeth.</HI> He <HI>extends</HI> his Piety, his Charity, he <HI>extends</HI> his Influence far and near; and he is a <HI>Diffusive</HI> good.</P>
<P>Once more, <HI>Gold</HI> is a <HI>Beautiful</HI> metal. 'Tis called, <HI>Aurum,</HI> for that very cause; <HI>ab Aura,</HI> i. e. <HI>a Splendore.</HI> Tis a shining and glitt'ring thing; and hence things that are very splendid, are said to be <HI>covered with yellow</HI> Gold. For this reason, an <HI>Hook</HI> of it once catch't <HI>Achan</HI> by <HI>the Lust of the Eye.</HI> Thus, a good man has a transcendent <HI>Beauty</HI> in him. To such an one, twas said in Cant. 6. 4. <HI>Thou art</HI> Beautiful. There is a Lustre on the <HI>Face,</HI> and a Lustre in the <HI>Walk</HI> of such a man; he has even the Splen|dor of <HI>A light in the world.</HI></P>
<P>Further more, <HI>Gold</HI> is a <HI>Durable</HI> Metal. Tho' the Bible affirms that it is <HI>Corruptibic,</HI> and <HI>Can|kerable,</HI> and <HI>Perishing,</HI> yet there is a mighty <HI>Strength</HI> to be ascribed unto it. It will endure the hottest <HI>Fire</HI> with small or no Diminution and <HI>Aqua-fortis</HI> it self will not eat into it. Such
<PB N="92" REF="000487_0100_0FA672BB29CA5188">
an <HI>Enduring</HI> thing is a good man. His Character is that in Matth. 24. 13. <HI>He shall</HI> endure <HI>to the end.</HI> No <HI>Fire,</HI> no <HI>Water,</HI> no Vexation shall con|sume his Devotion. He is the <HI>Overcomer,</HI> whom neither the Flattery nor the Fury, neither the Frowning nor the Fawning of any <HI>Tempter</HI> can dissolve the Religion of.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Gold</HI> is a <HI>Ponderous</HI> Metal. Even <HI>Lead</HI> it self in its weight, is to <HI>Gold</HI> as far short as <HI>Sixty</HI> is of an <HI>Hundred;</HI> if I mistake it not. Such is the <HI>Quality,</HI> such the <HI>Gravity</HI> of a good man. A godly man is a <HI>Weighty</HI> man. Tis said in Prov. 12. 26. <HI>A righteous man is more excel|lent than his neighbour.</HI> One such man will weigh down multitudes and myriads of other men. His being a <HI>pondering man,</HI> it soon makes him become <HI>ponderous</HI> man. His unconverted Neighbourhood may own of him, <HI>Thou art worth ten thousand of us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Finally Gold</HI> is a <HI>precious</HI> Metal. Its <HI>precious</HI> for the <HI>Use</HI> which tis of in <HI>Nature.</HI> Rich Cordials and Medicines are to be extracted from it. Its precious also for the <HI>Price</HI> which tis of in <HI>Esteem;</HI> the <HI>Auri sacra fames,</HI> the unhallowed Appetite which men crave it with, prefers it above all common things. Tis in Scripture-phrase a <HI>pre|cious</HI> thing indeed, of which it might be said, <HI>It is more precious than gold.</HI> But of a good man might such a thing be spoken: it may be said of such a man, as in <HI>Isa.</HI> 13. 12. The man is
<PB N="93" REF="000487_0101_0FA672BDA2C63CA8">
<HI>more precions than fine</HI> gold; <HI>even than the golden wedge of</HI> Ophir; [i. e. <HI>Peru,</HI> as some with much pretense of Reason do conjecture it.] A <HI>graci|ous</HI> man, is a <HI>precious</HI> man; all Beholders ought to put a value upon him; he is even, <HI>precious in the eyes of the Lord.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Conclusion. I.</HEAD>
<P>A good man is <HI>found</HI> good by the <HI>Examinati|ons</HI> of God. When God comes to <HI>try</HI> a good man, He finds the heart of the man to be <HI>right</HI> be|fore Him. The good man may say with him in 1. <HI>Chron.</HI> 29. 17. <HI>O my God, I know that thou</HI> triest <HI>the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness; as for mee, in the uprightness of my heart have I offered.</HI> Indeed our God uses not an Extremity of Justice and Rigour in our <HI>Trial;</HI> He would find a world of iniquity in us, if He did; and He would ut|terly consume us. The Lord said in Isa. 48. 10. <HI>Behold, I have refined thee, but not like silver.</HI> No, the Refiner of gold or silver will not allow the the least measure of <HI>Dross</HI> therein.

<P>A good man is <HI>made</HI> better by the <HI>Dispensati|ons</HI> of God.

It was an Orthodox perswasion in Psal. 139. 1, 2. <HI>O Lord thou hast searched me and known me; thou understandest my thought afar off.</HI> Tis very certain, that every one of our thoughts are known to the infinite God, even <HI>afar off,</HI> long enough before they come into our minds. But, <HI>O Lord, who has believed our Report?</HI> Men and Brethren, do you <HI>beleeve</HI> it, and apprehend it, and reallize it. <HI>Beleeve</HI> it, that God is <HI>all Eye,</HI> and that He needs not a <HI>Glass Window</HI>in your breasts for the Exploration of you. <HI>Beleeve</HI> it, that <HI>the eyes of the Lord run to &amp; fro, through the whole earth;</HI> and that he will not by a <HI>Mistake</HI> drop a Blessing wrong as blind <HI>Isaac</HI> did of old.

God will have His Times and His Wayes, possi|bly to <HI>uncase</HI> our hearts before all our Neigh|bours.

The <HI>Heart</HI> of man should Embrace this as the <HI>End</HI> of our lives.

qualified, when they have Respect unto the Praises of God.</HI></P>
<P>To clear this matter, there are these things to be conceived.</P>
<P>One Conclusion is, That the <HI>Living</HI> on Earth have many <HI>peculiar Opportunities</HI> to be <HI>Praising</HI> of God. Indeed, <HI>Blessed are the dead who dy in the Lord,</HI> for they too are alwaies <HI>praising</HI> of Him. But yet they rest from some <HI>Praises,</HI> when they <HI>rest from their Labours</HI> here. The departed Saints are continually shouting, <HI>Hallelujah, Hallelujah,</HI> before the Throne of God. The Saints, they are <HI>joyful in glory;</HI> and the <HI>High Praises</HI> of God are perpetually Proceeding from those blessed Souls. But Christians in this world have their <HI>peculiar Opportunities,</HI> to be Glorifying of Him that made them. This did the <HI>Psalmist</HI> speak in Ps. 88. 11. <HI>Shall the</HI> dead <HI>praise thee?</HI> To in|stance in some particulars:</P>
<P>The <HI>Living</HI> here may be <HI>Praising</HI> of God by the Discharge of many <HI>Relations,</HI> which the <HI>dead</HI> Saints are strangers unto. We may <HI>now</HI> praise God as <HI>Parents,</HI> as <HI>Masters,</HI> as <HI>Officers</HI> in the the Church or Common-Wealth All those Ca|pacities will <HI>dy</HI> with us, when we shall <HI>go hence and be no more.</HI></P>
<P>Again, The <HI>Living</HI> here may be <HI>Praising</HI> of God, by Bearing many a <HI>Witness</HI> to the <HI>Truths</HI> and <HI>Wayes</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ. We may now bestow many <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> upon the <HI>Errors</HI> and
<PB N="112" REF="000487_0120_0FA672D4678D55F0">
the <HI>Evils</HI> of a sinful World. We may part with and <HI>esteem,</HI> an <HI>Estate,</HI> with our <HI>Ease,</HI> and our <HI>Life</HI> it self, out of Respect unto the Name of God. But our <HI>Testimonies</HI> expire with our Lives:</P>
<P>Once more, The <HI>Living</HI> may be <HI>Praising</HI> of God by Advancing His <HI>Kingdom</HI> here below. In this Life we may be instrumental to Con|vince and Convert <HI>Unregenerate</HI> Sinners, to build up the <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord Jesus, and to Do good among the ignorant by an <HI>Exemplary Con|versation.</HI> But this is to be done only below the stars.</P>
<P>Furthermore, There are <HI>Graces</HI> proper to <HI>this</HI> Life which God is <HI>praised</HI> by the Exercising of. The Tears of <HI>Sorrow for Sin</HI> will be dry'd up, when we come to the State in which all <HI>Sor|row</HI> shall flee away. <HI>Charity</HI> in Giving and For|giving to them that need it,&mdash;there is no occa|sion for that Charity among them that are <HI>above; they</HI> are all perfect and happy there. <HI>Patience</HI> under Tryals belongs to our present Condition on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">; there are no <HI>Affliction</HI> to trouble us, when our <HI>few dayes full of trouble</HI> are passed away. In a Word. Our <HI>Spiritual Warfare</HI> is to be at|tended only in this <HI>Valley of the Shadow of Death.</HI> We cannot <HI>sight the Battles of the Lord,</HI> and there|in we cannot <HI>shew the</HI> praises <HI>of the Lord,</HI> when we are arrived at the <HI>End of our Faith the Salva|tion of our Souls.</HI> Our <HI>Fight</HI> is done, our <HI>Crown is</HI> come when we have been <HI>Faithful</HI> to the <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="000487_0121_0FA672D519FB7D40">
A Second Conclusion is, That <HI>Opportunities</HI> for the <HI>Praising</HI> of God are the things for which we should desire to be <HI>living</HI> on Earth. There is a Three-sold <HI>Desire of Life</HI> which the Living have. There is a <HI>Natural</HI> Desire of Life. This is common both to <HI>good</HI> men and <HI>bad</HI> men. <HI>Na|ture</HI> it self startles at the Approach of <HI>Death; </HI> In|nocent Nature shivers and recoyls, when this <HI>King of Terrors</HI> is ready to lay his cold Icy hand upon us. This was <HI>Joab'</HI>s Desire: that valiant Souldier, The <HI>Lord-General</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> himself, in 1. King. 2. 28. being in gold blood under Ap|prehensions of <HI>Death,</HI> fled unto the Horns of the <HI>Altar,</HI> as a Sanctuary to save his <HI>Life.</HI> There is also a <HI>Sensual</HI> Desire of Life. This is that which <HI>Bad</HI> men are under the power of. Many are loth to dye because they would not leave the <HI>Pleasures</HI> and <HI>Profits</HI> and <HI>Honours</HI> which did sur|round them here. They are like the Miser who on his Death-Bed hugg'd his Baggs of Gold, and cry'd out, <HI>Must I leave you? Must I leave you?</HI> Their Love of their <HI>Life,</HI> comes from their love of their <HI>Flesh.</HI> This was the <HI>Rich Fools</HI> Desire, in Luc. 12. 20. He wished for <HI>many Years,</HI> that he might <HI>eat and drink,</HI> and <HI>be merry</HI> here.</P>
<P>There is likewise a <HI>gracious</HI> Desire of Life. And <HI>this</HI> is that which <HI>good</HI> men are affected with: They desire to <HI>live,</HI> because they desire to <HI>praise.</HI> They would live, because they would honour
<PB N="114" REF="000487_0122_0FA672D5D91635F0">
God in those matters &amp; those manners for which their Lives do afford them blessed <HI>Opportunities</HI> and <HI>Advantages.</HI> Now this <HI>gracious</HI> Desire of of Life is a <HI>Regular</HI> Desire. A <HI>Desire</HI> of Life for the <HI>Praise</HI> of God, is the only <HI>Desire</HI> of Life, that will have praise of God. This was <HI>David's</HI> Desire when he was visited with Sick|ness, when he was <HI>meak,</HI> and his Bones were pained, then said he in Psal. 6. 5. <HI>O Save me, for in</HI> Death <HI>there is</HI> no Remembrance <HI>of thee, in the</HI> Grave <HI>who shall give thee thanks?</HI> Such Desires are the only <HI>right</HI> and <HI>chast</HI> Desires. It is not sit for a Christian to say, <HI>I</HI> desire <HI>to</HI> live, <HI>because I am</HI> afraid <HI>to dy.</HI> Much less is it sit for him to say, I desire <HI>my</HI> life in <HI>the world, that I may turn and wind still the Affairs</HI> of the <HI>World</HI> But This is that which Logitimates the Desire of Life: As every thing is to be <HI>improved</HI> for God, so every thing should be <HI>desired</HI> for God. And thus <HI>Life</HI> it self. We are daily <HI>Praying,</HI> as he in Psal. 102. 24. <HI>O my God, take me not away in the midst of my dayes.</HI> Well, Our God enquires of us, <HI>Why art thou in willing to be taken away in the midst of thy dayes?</HI> We should have this to be our true Account of it, <HI>Because, O Lord, I am loth to be taken away in the midst of my</HI> Praise.</P>

shape a course Right. All the <HI>Directions,</HI> all the <HI>Promises,</HI> all the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of God, will be so many Helps, of our Obedience. If any man ask, <HI>How do the</HI> Scriptures <HI>of God help men in the</HI> Prais|es <HI>of God?</HI> Know, The Scriptures themselves give an Answer thereunto, in Psal. 19. 7, 8. <HI>The Law of the Lord converts the soul, the testimonies of the Lord make wise the simple; the statutes of the Lord rejoice the heart; the commandments of the Lord enlighten the eyes.</HI> That <HI>Conversion,</HI> that <HI>Instruction</HI> that <HI>Joy</HI> and that <HI>Light</HI> which the <HI>Word</HI> of God affords unto us, will be no little Help in the <HI>Praise</HI> of God.</P>
<P>Secondly, the <HI>Rod</HI> of God is to be <HI>used</HI> as the Help of our Praising Him. The Lord sends ma|ny <HI>Afflictions</HI> upon us. An <HI>Heman,</HI> is afflicted in his mind: a <HI>Job</HI> is Afflicted in his Estate; a <HI>Gains</HI> is afflicted in his Body, a <HI>Paul</HI> in his Credit, and a <HI>David</HI> in his Children, they <HI>live ill</HI> and they <HI>dy worse</HI> before him. What is the Use we are now to make of these things? Truly our <HI>Afflictions</HI> are to be the Help of our <HI>Devotions.</HI> It is the Call of God in <HI>Mic.</HI> 6. 9. <HI>Hear the Rod.</HI> As we should hear the <HI>Voice</HI> of the Rod, so we should use of the Help of the Rod. By our <HI>Afflictions</HI> we should be <HI>helped</HI> unto more Se|riousness more Watchfulness, more Fruitful|ness. Now those things are to the <HI>Praise</HI> of the glory of the grace of God. Our <HI>Afflictions</HI> are the <HI>purgings</HI> &amp; the <HI>prunings</HI> bestowed by our God
<PB N="117" REF="000487_0125_0FA672DC9A535D58">
upon us. What are they for? but, <HI>That we may bring forth</HI> more <HI>Fruit:</HI> and we are told in <HI>Job.</HI> 15. 8. <HI>Herein is my father</HI> glorified, <HI>if ye bring forth</HI> much fruit. Observe it: a <HI>Learning.</HI> the <HI>Statutes</HI> of God, is a <HI>Rendring</HI> of <HI>Praises</HI> to God; those two things are <HI>one.</HI> Now see what the Psal|mist faith, in Psal. 119. 97. <HI>Tis good for me that I have been</HI> afflicted, <HI>that I may</HI> learn <HI>thy Statutes.</HI> This then is incumbent on us under every Affliction; Our study should be, <HI>What Advantage, what Engagement to be more holy, is now put into my hands!</HI> Every Afflicted man should ask, <HI>How may the</HI> Sorrowes <HI>of my</HI> life <HI>promote the</HI> praises <HI>of my</HI> God?</P>

<P>Some <HI>Evil Desires</HI> are hence Rebuked and Con|demned. Especially <HI>two</HI> sorts of Desires.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Impatient</HI> Desires of <HI>Death</HI> are to be Re|proved.</P>
<P>Something is to be said by way of <HI>Concession;</HI> and something by way of <HI>Correction</HI> about such Desires.</P>
<P>First by way of <HI>Concession.</HI> I would say; There are <HI>some</HI> Desires of Death will <HI>becoming</HI> a Child of God. Such were the Desires of <HI>Paul,</HI> in Phil. I. 22. <HI>I desire to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Christ.</HI> When we think of the day, in which we shall go to the the <HI>Spirits of just men made perfect;</HI> and to <HI>Jesus the Mediator of the New-Covenant;</HI> When we
<PB N="118" REF="000487_0126_0FA672DED8125E68">
think of the day in which the <HI>Lord will deliver us from the hand of all our enemies, and from the hand of SIN;</HI> O the thoughts of it should fill out Souls with Raptures of Joy! they should cause our hearts to leap and spring within us. It is an allowable thing to be almost angry with <HI>Time,</HI> to call upon slow <HI>Time,</HI> and say, <HI>Fly apace; Fly away, O Time; Come, O</HI> Eternity, <HI>come and fetch me into the presence of the Lord.</HI> The Visi|ons of the Lord Jesus may cause us to say hum|bly with aged, faithful <HI>Simeon,</HI> Lord, <HI>let thy ser|vant</HI> depart <HI>in peace.</HI> The Chariots of <HI>Death,</HI> sent by the Lord Jesus to fetch us unto Himself should be as welcom to us, as the <HI>Waggons</HI> of <HI>Jo|seph</HI> were to <HI>Jacob</HI> of old. It should cause us to <HI>Rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory,</HI> when we think of the <HI>unspeakable joy</HI> and the <HI>full glory</HI> which we are going unto. There are holy <HI>long|ings</HI> and <HI>lookings</HI> of Soul, with which we may cry out, <HI>Why, why are His Chariots so long I com|ing? Why tarry the Wheels thereof?</HI></P>
<P>But yet,</P>
<P>Secondly, By way of <HI>Correction.</HI></P>
<P>If these <HI>Desires</HI> are <HI>with</HI> Impatience, much more if they are <HI>thro'</HI> Impatience, they become sinful before the Lord. The embittered spirits of Christians, have been sometimes too phone unto <HI>such</HI> Desires. It was an inordinate passion in <HI>Moses,</HI> when a froward people under his charge provoked him to say, in <HI>Numb.</HI> 17. 14. <HI>Kill
<PB N="119" REF="000487_0127_0FA672DF9C2B6148">
I pray thee out of hand.</HI> Had God granted his Desire, he had lost Thirty years of eminent Service in the World. It was an irregular passion in <HI>Elias,</HI> when the persecutions of wic|ked men so tired him, as to make him say, in 1. King. 19. 4. <HI>O Lord, take away my life.</HI> It hath been an Observation, that <HI>Many good and great men sit under</HI> Elias's <HI>Juniper tree.</HI> As culpa|ble was the Passion of <HI>Jonah,</HI> when the Wither|ing of a Guord had that Effect upon him in Cap. 4. 8. <HI>He wished to</HI> dy. The like <HI>pang,</HI> of Impa|tience, did that <HI>Pattern</HI> of Patience, <HI>Joh,</HI> fall into: he spake as if he could hardly forbear <HI>Laying. violent hanas</HI> upon himself. Even so far do the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> unbridled Wishes of many run. There <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of Death is a sort of <HI>Revenge</HI> on God; they would as it were deprive God of the glory which He might have of them. Compose these desires, O ye raging Souls; compose these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fires. Allay this <HI>Fever,</HI> this phrensy. Its not on|ly an <HI>irreligious</HI> but an <HI>unnatural</HI> passion which you are carried away withal. You desire to <HI>dye:</HI> Well, are you sure that the <HI>Death</HI> which you <HI>de|sire</HI> now, will not prove a <HI>Death</HI> which you shall <HI>Deplore</HI> throughout eternal Ages. It is said of the Believer in Psal. 91. 19. <HI>With</HI> long life <HI>will I</HI> satisfie <HI>him, and shew him my Salvation.</HI> It is a very disordered heart that will be <HI>dissatisfied</HI> with so great a mercy.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Unsanctified</HI> Desires of Life are to
<PB N="120" REF="000487_0128_0FA672E05C974660">
be Reproved also. Of these Desires there are Three Sorts to be Reprehended.</P>
<P>There are, first. <HI>Carnal</HI> Desires of Life to be blamed. Some desire to <HI>live,</HI> and wherefore is it? It is because they desire to <HI>eat</HI> and <HI>drink</HI> and be merry. They cann't part with such <HI>Relations</HI> and <HI>Possessions</HI> as are here to be enjoyed. The <HI>Comforts</HI> of Life are the things that cause their <HI>Desires</HI> of Life. One once beholding his fine Ac|commodations made this Reflection thereupon, <HI>Hac faciant invitos mori;</HI> these are the things that make us <HI>unwilling to dy.</HI> Unmortified Corrupti|ons are the causes of these desires. Remember what the Lord hath said in Matth. 10. 37. <HI>He that loveth Father or Mother, or Son or</HI> DAUGH|TER <HI>more than me, is not worthy of me.</HI> Thus may the Lord well say to the <HI>Subject</HI> of these De|sires, <HI>If you had rather be with your</HI> friends <HI>on</HI> earth, <HI>than with your</HI> Father <HI>in</HI> Heaven, <HI>you are not wor|thy to be with me at all.</HI> And this by the way is to he said of them that desire the life of their <HI>Friends</HI> as well as of them <HI>selves.</HI> It is for the Interest of the Lord Jesus Christ that the dead <HI>Children</HI> which you lament, <HI>are dead;</HI> or else they had not dyed at all. Now sais the Lrod Je|sus, <HI>If thou lovest those</HI> CHILDREN, <HI>those Re|lations more than me, and hadst rather have them with thy self, to my</HI> Prejudice, <HI>than to have them with me, to thy own</HI> Bereavement, <HI>thou art not worthy to have them with me at all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="000487_0129_0FA672E12645BEA8">
Secondly. There are <HI>Careful</HI> Desires of Life to be likewise blamed. Many desire to <HI>live</HI> only upon this account, <HI>Some</HI> Child, <HI>or some</HI> Charge <HI>they are concerned for.</HI> They have this or that <HI>Child</HI> which they cannot believe will be well pro|vided for, when they are <HI>dead;</HI> or they suspect what will become of such or such a <HI>Charge.</HI> There is indeed a Desire of Life on such a Score, which is not alwaies very severely to be found fault withal. But oftentimes there is too much <HI>Distrust</HI> in such a <HI>desire.</HI> Why cannot we venture out Families and the Concernments thereof, in the Hands of the faithful God? The Lord has said in Jer. 49. 11. <HI>Leave thy fatherless</HI> Children, <HI>I will preserve them alive.</HI> And he still saies, <HI>I will be a</HI> better Father, <HI>and a</HI> better Friend <HI>unto them, than thou thy self canst be.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. There are <HI>Fearful</HI> Desires of Life which are blame-worthy too. When Death comes with that message, <HI>Set thy</HI> Soul <HI>in order, for thou shalt dy and not live,</HI> many persons are so terrified as to be even at their wits ends. O how they groan. <HI>I cannot dy!</HI> Indeed Sinners that have not been <HI>born twice,</HI> may well tremble to <HI>dy once;</HI> no body can blame <HI>them;</HI> there is a <HI>Se|cond Death,</HI> ready to sieze upon the forlorn souls that are not Regenerate. But such as have been truly turn'd to God in Christ, should not enter|tain Death with such Reluctancies. Can you not uprightly say, That if you were sure to be <HI>freed</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="000487_0130_0FA672E1E0036B58">
from <HI>Sin,</HI> you could be content to be struck by Death? O then, be cheerfully willing to <HI>Dy.</HI> Thy soul will no sooner pass into Eternity but it shall experience that thing in <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 7. <HI>He that is</HI> dead <HI>is</HI> freed <HI>from Sin.</HI> It is often pretended by men, <HI>I would</HI> live <HI>because, I would be more</HI> ho|ly <HI>before I dy.</HI> Tis well; but there is not seldom a <HI>Deceit</HI> in the <HI>Pretence;</HI> often something else is in the Bottom; <HI>A Rebellion against the Will of God.</HI> Wouldst thou really and earnestly be <HI>ho|ly?</HI> Be willing then to <HI>dy</HI> as well as to <HI>live.</HI> Death is the way to <HI>Holiness</HI> in the Perfection of it. In short: Good was the Temper of that sick person who being asked, <HI>Which do you desire, to</HI> live, <HI>or to dy?</HI> answered, <HI>I refer it to</HI> God; and when it was again said, <HI>But suppose God should refer it to you?</HI> reply'd <HI>I would then re|fer it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him again.</HI></P>

<HEAD>USE. II.</HEAD>
<P>Let us all be now <HI>Exhorted,</HI> that the <HI>Praise</HI> of God, may be duly accounted by us, as the <HI>End</HI> of our Life, in our Prayers for it. Let us not shoot beside our <HI>Mark,</HI> or live beside our <HI>End.</HI> Let us <HI>pray</HI> that we may <HI>live,</HI> and let us <HI>live</HI> that we may <HI>praise.</HI> It is the most lamentable plight in the world, that a man should spend his <HI>Life</HI> in <HI>Sinning</HI> against God, rather than in <HI>Praising</HI> of Him. But alas, This is the case of <HI>Multi|tudes, Multitudes</HI> among us. How few of <HI>us</HI> [Consider of it seriously] How few of <HI>you</HI> that
<PB N="123" REF="000487_0131_0FA672E2A8C44780">
are now before the Lord, ever seriously thought with your selves, <HI>What is the Errand that I am come into the world upon?</HI> Hast thou not lived a|bove a Score of years in the world, and never yet seriously thought, <HI>What is it that God sent me hither for?</HI> Every man here, I suppose, de|sires to live; let your <HI>Prayers</HI> express those <HI>De|sires;</HI> and say after the Psalmist, <HI>Ps.</HI> 32. 8. <HI>My Prayer is to the God of my life.</HI> But more than so, Let those Desires be for the sake of your <HI>Praises;</HI> and say after the Psalmist again, in Ps. 119. 17. <HI>Deal bountifully with thy Servant that I may live and keep thy Word.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Three</HI> things are you to be advised unto; yea <HI>Four</HI> things are to be importunately prest upon you.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Mark</HI> and <HI>Prize</HI> your <HI>Opportunities</HI> to be <HI>Praising</HI> of God. Every man has his <HI>Opportu|nities.</HI> Some have an Instrument of a <HI>Thousand</HI> Strings; but the meanest of us all has an Instru|ment of <HI>Ten</HI> strings, for our God to be <HI>praised</HI> with. Let every man often enquire, <HI>What are my</HI> Opportunities <HI>to glorify God?</HI> And let every man alwaies conclude, <HI>My Opportunities are my Treasures.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Let the <HI>Word</HI> of God <HI>Direct</HI> you in His Praises. Be often Consulting of that: <HI>Peace</HI> will be <HI>on</HI> all, and <HI>Praise</HI> will be <HI>from</HI> all, <HI>that walk according to this Rule.</HI> A Bible,&mdash;Christians, let <HI>That</HI> be your <HI>Counsellour</HI> on all Occasions,
<PB N="124" REF="000487_0132_0FA672E35BB5AC78">
The Psalmist could say in Ps. 119. 164. <HI>Seven times a day will I praise thee O Lord; because of thy Righteous</HI> Judgements.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Let the <HI>Rod</HI> of God <HI>provoke</HI> you to His <HI>Praises.</HI> If you cannot <HI>Bless</HI> God <HI>for</HI> your Afflictions, which yet, I think, is a thing attain|able; nevertheless, I'm sure you should <HI>praise</HI> God <HI>in</HI> your <HI>Afflictions.</HI> Let God gain some <HI>Glory,</HI> and we shall gain some <HI>Good,</HI> by all our Suffer|ings. Take the counsil in <HI>Isa.</HI> 34. 15. <HI>Glorifie the Lord in the Fires.</HI></P>
<P>To Enforce these <HI>Three</HI> Things;</P>
<P>Consider <HI>that</HI> Thing wich is intimated in the Text. The <HI>Lives</HI> of your <HI>Souls</HI> are enwrapped in the praises of God. Saies the Psalmist, <HI>Let my</HI> soul live, <HI>and it shall</HI> praise <HI>thee.</HI> So I may say, <HI>Let thy Soul</HI> praise, <HI>and it shall</HI> live. A <HI>prais|ing</HI> Soul, is a <HI>Thriving</HI> Soul. In this consisteth <HI>Life Eternal</HI> it self, The <HI>Life</HI> of thy <HI>Soul</HI> in the Third Heaven, will be the <HI>praise</HI> of thy <HI>God</HI> for evermore. Praise God <HI>for</HI> thy Life; it is a mercy well worth praise. Praise God <HI>by</HI> thy life; so thou wilt begin <HI>Heaven upon Earth.</HI></P>
<P>But there is a <HI>Fourth</HI> Counsil which more im|mediately concerns that part of the Congregation which are of <HI>my own Age,</HI> and have therefore a more peculiar interest in my <HI>Loves</HI> and <HI>Cares.</HI></P>
<P>Tis to <HI>Young</HI> People here, that I take leave to say,</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Begin You</HI> now <HI>Betimes</HI> to live unto
<PB N="125" REF="000487_0133_0FA672E608224298">
the <HI>Praise</HI> of the everliving God. My Brethren, you have not yet begun to <HI>live</HI> at all, if you have not begun to <HI>praise</HI> the Lord. You are <HI>Dead in Trespasses and Sins;</HI> you are stark <HI>dead</HI> in the rotten, hideous, loathsome <HI>Graves</HI> of your Unregeneracy, if you have not yet begun to <HI>or|der your Conversation aright,</HI> and to ponder, <HI>How may I so</HI> offer praise <HI>as to Glorify God?</HI> But is not this the deplorable Condition of <HI>many,</HI> many <HI>Young</HI> people here? <HI>Conscience,</HI> do thine Office! Is not the Hour yet <HI>to come,</HI> is not the Day yet to <HI>dawn,</HI> when <HI>that</HI> young person (whom thon art the <HI>Officer</HI> of God unto) did by an hearty <HI>Convenant</HI> bind himselfe unto the <HI>Serving</HI> and the <HI>Praising</HI> of the Lord?</P>
<P>But what mean you, O ye inconsiderate <HI>Youths,</HI> to delay the <HI>Remembring of your Creator</HI> so? In the Language of the <HI>young</HI> Prophet, whom God sent unto the <HI>Jews</HI> of old, let me say, <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s saith the Lord, Consider your waies.</HI></P>
<P>Consider the <HI>Uncertainly</HI> of your <HI>Life</HI> which you have to be praising of God withal. As <HI>young</HI> as you are, you may <HI>dy</HI> before the most aged pet|son here. It hath been truly noted, That <HI>The</HI> old <HI>man has Death</HI> before <HI>his face, but the</HI> young <HI>man has Death</HI> behind <HI>his back.</HI> The stroak of Death may sooner lay <HI>you</HI> in the Dust, than some whose Heads old <HI>Time</HI> hath <HI>snow'd</HI> upon. O look, and see, and let thy heart shake at the Ap|prehension of it: Thy <HI>Death</HI> stands, just behind

The Blessed God hath newly caused me to look into the <HI>Coffins</HI> to two very near and sweet Relations, neither of which had wer seen <HI>Twenty</HI> Winters in the World; and with a <HI>strong hand</HI> He then said unto me, <HI>Go, Go tell the young people of</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. <HI>and</HI> Charlestown, <HI>that this so that which they are all expos'd unto.</HI> Behold I am now come <HI>in Bitterness and in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of my spirit,</HI> I am come to Warn you of it, That <HI>You may dy before you are aware of such a dis|cmal Change at hand.</HI> O do not procrastinate the <HI>praises</HI> and the <HI>Vertues</HI> which the God of Heaven Expects from you; put not off until, <HI>To|morrow;</HI> For tis the admonition to be now set before you, in Prov. 2. 7. <HI>Boast not thy self of</HI> Tomorrow, <HI>for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</HI></P>
<P>But Consider also, the <HI>Dreadfulness,</HI> of a <HI>Death,</HI> ensuing upon a <HI>Life</HI> not spent in the <HI>prais|ing</HI> of God.
