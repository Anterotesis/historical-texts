<HEAD>A LERTTER From Dr. <HI>BRAY,</HI> to &s;uch as have Contributed to|wards the Propagating <HI>Chri&s;tian Knowledge</HI> in the <HI>Plantations.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEing apprehen&s;ive that my &s;o &s;udden Return for <HI>England,</HI> may occa&s;ion &s;ome Mi&s;con&s;tructions till the true Rea&s;ons thereof &s;hall be under&s;tood, to the prejudice of tho&s;e De&s;igns&punc; which you do &s;o nobly &s;upport, for the De&s;truction of the Powers of Darkne&s;s, and the Enlargement of Chri&s;t's Kingdom in His Maje&s;ty's Plantations, I thought my &s;elf in Duty, Gratitude, and in Prudence bound, to repre&s;ent hereby a General View of tho&s;e Rea&s;ons, which have induced me to make it &s;o &s;oon, and unexpectedly. And they are as follows.</P>
<P><HI>FIRST,</HI> It is pur&s;uant to the De&s;ire of the General A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Mary-Land</HI>; who having mo&s;t unanimou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed a Bill of the Highe&s;t Con&s;equence for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of our Church, voted that I &s;hould be de&s;ired to reque&s;t my Lord's Grace of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and my Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> to favour that good Law, by obtaining His Maje&s;ty's Royal A&s;&s;ent to the &s;ame, with all convenient Expe|dition. And the Members, who gave me an Account of pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch a Vote, told me withal, that it was the General Opinion, that I could be mo&s;t &s;er|viceable herein, by waiting per&s;onally upon Their Lord&s;hips, rather than by Letters: In which I could not crowd all that may be nece&s;&s;ary to be repre&s;ented concerning the pre&s;ent State of the Church, and the Nece&s;&s;ity, at this time, of their utmo&s;t Patronage. And it was in Debate, whether I &s;hould not be de&s;ired by the A&s;&s;embly &s;o to do: But that it was thought this would be to unrea|&s;onable a Reque&s;t, they being &s;en&s;ible of the great Charges and Fatigues I had been already at, in the Service of that Province; as they had a few days before acknowledged by a Me&s;&s;age from the Hou&s;e, with their Thanks for the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>SECONDLY,</HI> It is at the joint Reque&s;t of the Clergy of <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> who at the Clo&s;e of my Vi&s;itation, among&s;t other pre&s;&s;ing Rea&s;ons, urged me with this, that they found it to be the earne&s;t De&s;ire of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible, and well-affected to our Religion, throughout the Province, that I &s;hould go over with the Law for <HI>England</HI>; Now that the Quakers are openly, and the Papi&s;ts more co|vertly, making their utmo&s;t Efforts again&s;t the E&s;tabli&s;hment of our Church, by fal&s;e Repre&s;entations at home, of the Numbers and Riches of their Party; and by in&s;inuating, That to impo&s;e upon them an E&s;tabli&s;h'd Mainte|nance for the Clergy, would be prejudicial to the Intere&s;t of the Province, by obliging &s;o many wealthy Traders to remove from thence. The Fal&s;ity of which they thought me be&s;t able to make appear, by means of my late Parochial Vi&s;itations, throughout the greate&s;t Part of the Province; more e&s;pecially, by the Returns given in upon my <HI>Tabula prima Parochialium Inquirendorum</HI>; by which, when they &s;hall be all &s;ent in, I &s;hall be enabled to give an Account of the Names of all Heads of Families, and not only of the Religion, but in a good mea&s;ure of the Morals of every Man, Woman and Child, Freeman and Slave, White and Black, throughout <HI>Mary-Land.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THIRDLY,</HI> Having an&s;wer'd the Clergy, that I could ea&s;ily be per&s;waded, either to go or &s;tay, by the &s;ame Motives that urged my coming &s;o many Thou|&s;and
<PB N="2" REF="000903_0002_0FAC9C66213724B0">
Miles to vi&s;it them; <HI>viz.</HI> as it &s;hould appear to me wherein I could be mo&s;t &s;erviceable to the Church, by the one, or the other: Yet being re&s;olv'd to pay the greate&s;t Deference to tho&s;e in Authority, I &s;hould determine my &s;elf in &s;o nice a Point by the Judgment of the Governor. Upon which the Clergy having addre&s;&s;ed his Excellency with their Rea&s;ons, he was plea&s;ed to prevent my wait|ing upon him, by coming to me immediately as &s;oon as the Vi&s;itation was fini&s;hed, and declared him&s;elf to be very much of the &s;ame Opinion with the Clergy, as to the Importance of my going over.</P>
<P><HI>FO&V;RTHLY,</HI> It is to repre&s;ent to my Superiors the State of Religion in <HI>Mary-Land, Pen&s;ylvania,</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Jer&s;eys,</HI> which requires &s;ome &s;peedy Con&s;ideration; and with reference to which, I have &s;everal things to propo&s;e to my Superiors, wherein I &s;hall want their In&s;tructions.</P>
<P><HI>FIFTHLY,</HI> It is in order to make the better Choice of proper Mini&s;ters for the Service of tho&s;e Churches, agreeable to what I have ob&s;erved of the State, the Temper, and Con&s;titution of the Country and People: Of which Mini&s;ters, as there are &s;till-wanting at lea&s;t Thirty; &s;o they mu&s;t have &s;ome peculiar Qualifications, if they would do good there. To &s;upply which want, and to get &s;uch qualify'd Per&s;ons, it is nece&s;&s;ary to confer with my Lord of <HI>London</HI>: As al&s;o to write to &s;uch of my Lords the Bi&s;hops, and the Reverend Arch-Deacons, as I have the Honour to be known to, to re|commend to me proper Per&s;ons, &s;uch as they know to be, not only of an exact Conduct, both as to Prudence, and all other good Morals, and have been for &s;ome time Curates, well experienced in the Pa&s;toral Care; but al&s;o of a true publick, di&s;intere&s;ted; in one word, of a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary Spirit,</HI> having a Zeal for God's Glory, and the Salvation of Mens Souls; and &s;uch as are by no means grown into Years, who cannot endure Fatigue; (the Pari&s;hes as yet being very large) nor yet on the other &s;ide, raw young Men, who can never pre&s;erve them|&s;elves above Contempt among&s;t a People of &s;uch quick Parts, and good Intel|lectuals, as the Plantation-People are generally ob&s;erv'd to be.</P>
<P><HI>SIXTHLY,</HI> It may perhaps appear of le&s;s weight than it really is, &s;hould I give it as one of my Rea&s;ons, that I may procure, and carry back with me a con&s;iderable number of <HI>Carpenters, Bricklayers,</HI> and <HI>Joyners,</HI> to fini&s;h &s;ome <HI>Churches,</HI> and to build <HI>Par&s;onage-Hou&s;es</HI> upon the Glebes; which I have al|ready procured, and hope in a &s;hort time to have &s;ettled throughout the Province. The want of Workmen makes Building there exce&s;&s;ively chargeable; &s;o that I find upon auditing the Accounts of the &s;everal Ve&s;tries in my Parochial Vi&s;i|tations, that the large Sums laid out in building their Churches, is by no means an&s;wer'd in the Fabricks: And therefore to husband the Charity of the Country, that &s;hall be given towards building of the Par&s;onage Hou&s;es, &s;o as it &s;hall be more exten&s;ive, I have brought the Clergy into a Sub&s;cription, to maintain every one his Work-man, and to allow him much better than the Cu&s;tom of the Country is to do, and yet to be no Lo&s;ers thereby them&s;elves. By which means I am enabled to make &s;uch Propo&s;als, as will give &s;ufficient Encourage|ment to good Workmen, and &s;ober Per&s;ons, to go over with me. But though this may be too mean a Con&s;ideration; yet,</P>
<P><HI>LASTLY,</HI> I hope this may appear of &s;ome weight; that it is, Becau&s;e I find there comes under my Cognizance &s;everal very important Ca&s;es to be &s;pee|dily tried, with relation to the Clergy and Laity. To determine &s;everal of which, being of &s;o high a Nature, as <HI>Forgery of Holy Orders, Polygamy</HI> and <HI>Ince&s;t,</HI> I want In&s;tructions as to the Manner and Forms of Proceedings: And as it appears to me, have no Power, by my Commi&s;&s;ion, to give &s;uch Sentences as the Nature of the Crimes will require. And in the due Execution of which, as I perceive that I have many Eyes upon me; &s;o the Country expects that &s;ome|thing &s;hould be done effectually in that Matter; and &s;hould I fail therein, my being there would be to no manner of purpo&s;e of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 word">nece&s;&s;ary Regulation of the Clergy and Laity.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="000903_0003_0FAC9C66E1C464D8">I hope the&s;e Rea&s;ons may appear &s;ufficient to Per&s;ons of that &s;ingular Can|dour, and Goodne&s;s, which I have found in you. But becau&s;e it is fit you &s;hould be in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;atisfy'd at pre&s;ent (tho' I intend to do it hereafter in an ample and publick manner) of the good that has been wrought by your means; I do a&s;&s;ure you, that be&s;ides the very u&s;eful Libraries, which are provided through your Benefactions, and are &s;ettled in <HI>Pen&s;ilvania, New-York, New-Eng|land, Carolina, Bermudas,</HI> are begun in &s;everal of the <HI>Leward I&s;lands,</HI> and are far advanc'd in <HI>Mary-Land</HI>; I have received in the latter the Acknowledgments of the mo&s;t publick Per&s;ons, that the Face of Things, as to Religion, Humanity, and good Morals, is very much alter'd for the better within the&s;e few Years, that a Clergy have been &s;ent among&s;t them: And have, I hope in my Vi&s;i|tation, &s;et the Clergy in &s;uch Methods, as, with the Divine Benediction upon their Endeavours, will render them a continued Ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>And it may not be ami&s;s to add, that as I have per&s;onally found the whole Body of the <HI>Mary-Land</HI> Clergy (excepting two, who have in part met alrea|dy, and will &s;ufficiently feel the Effects of Di&s;cipline,) to give me an unu&s;ual Demon&s;tration of their <HI>Pa&s;toral Care</HI>: And &s;ome of them to have &s;o &s;ignalized them&s;elves, by their Indu&s;try, in the In&s;truction of the <HI>Negro's</HI> within their re&s;pective Pari&s;hes, (of which they have baptized great Numbers) that the&s;e poor Barbarians are not now the mo&s;t ignorant, and lea&s;t Solemn, Part of their A&s;&s;emblies; So at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in <HI>Pen&s;ilvania,</HI> the Congregation of Church-People, which amounted but to 60, at the mo&s;t, not two Years ago, through the Ble&s;&s;ing of God upon the Endeavours of a late <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionary,</HI> is now increas'd, chiefly from <HI>Quaker-Converts,</HI> to upwards of 700. And the People of that Province do earne&s;tly de&s;ire to be &s;upply'd with &s;everal Mini&s;ters more; as indeed I think the Field is there, and the Neighbouring Parts, &s;o happi|ly &s;own by the excellent Mr. <HI>Keith,</HI> that it is become now as ripe for Harve&s;t, as in any part of the Chri&s;tian World. And it being a main part of my De&s;ign in coming over at this time, to procure, and take back very &s;peedily with me, right worthy Men, &s;uch as are capable to do the greate&s;t good, I do earne&s;tly de&s;ire, that if you know any Clergyman &s;o qualified, and alike Spirited as Cha|racterized above in the Fifth Article, you would lay before him what Ser|vice he may do to the Church of God in tho&s;e Parts, now that there is &s;o happy a Di&s;po&s;ition therein to receive the Truth. I am &s;orry that, in the pre&s;ent State I find that Church, which is but in its Infancy, I cannot promi&s;e that their Places will be very con&s;iderable, the Glebes which I have, and am about to get, being as yet uncultivated. But I can a&s;&s;ure them, they may at this juncture be very <HI>Extraordinarily</HI> in&s;trumental to the Glory of God, the be&s;t Argument I can u&s;e to &s;uch Per&s;ons as I want; and that which has been the great Motive, and &s;ole Support, during a five Years Service to tho&s;e Churches, to him that u&s;es it: Al&s;o that their Livings will be improvable, and that they &s;hall find all po&s;&s;ible Encouragement that may be contriv'd, and procur'd by their mo&s;t Affectio|nate Brother, and</P>
