<HEAD>His Excellency the Earl of <HI>Bellomont</HI>'s SPEECH To the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives convened in General A&s;&s;embly at <HI>New-York</HI> the 29th day of <HI>July,</HI> 1700.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLE-MEN;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thought a Se&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary at this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, that you might advi&s;e &s;uch mea&s;ures as will be&s;t &s;ecure the five Nations of Indians in their Obedience to the Crown, which all of you know is of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;equence to this, and all the rest of the Engli&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>America.</HI> Our Neighbours of <HI>Canada</HI> know the value of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to us, and therefore with indefatigable Pains are every day &s;educing them from us by their Je&s;uits; and 'tis &s;aid, that &s;uch as will not be &s;educed, are many of 'em taken off by Poy&s;on. I will order the Te&s;timonies I have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the&s;e wicked Practions to be laid before you, which I believe will convince you of the truth of them.</P>
<P>The proper Remedies again&s;t the&s;e growing Mi&s;chiefs the Indians them|&s;elves have chalk'd out to us. They have often pre&s;&s;ed me with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> In|&s;tance, that they may have <HI>Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters</HI> to in&s;truct <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Chri&s;tian Religion, and a Fort to cover 'em from the Incursions of the <HI>French</HI> and their Indians. I hope there will be a way <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> them with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> for a Fort that belongs to you to provide. I am al|ways very tender of engaging you in things o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Expence, but the building a Fort to &s;ecure the <HI>Indians,</HI> and &s;atisfie them, is &s;uch an Expence as I believe every Man of you will think indi&s;pen&s;ably Nece&s;&s;ary, and that it &s;hould be built al&s;o out of hand, that the <HI>Indians</HI> may be encouraged by &s;eeing there's care taken for their Protection.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives:</HI></P>
<P>I hope there needs no other Argument than that I have now offered to quicken you to the giving &s;uch a Supply as may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> con|venient part of the County, for defence of the five Nations. You need not be told how much the Honour and Intere&s;t of the Crown, and your own private intere&s;t are engageds in the right Management &amp; Pre&s;ervation tho&s;e Indians, and you cannot give the King a better Te&s;timony of your Duty and Affection to his Maje&s;ties Per&s;on and Government, than by a cheerful com|plyance with what has been now propo&s;ed to you. I would offer to you the pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Laws, but that I con&s;ider 'tis Harve&s;t time, and I will give as &s;hort an Interruption to your Country Affairs as I can; be&s;ides, I have appointed a Meeting and Conference with the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the five Nations next week at <HI>Albany,</HI> which I intend accordingly to perform.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>BY virtue of an Order from the honourable Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, I do appoint</HI> William Bradford <HI>to Print his Excellency's Speech.</HI> Abra. Gouverneur, <HI>Speaker.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
