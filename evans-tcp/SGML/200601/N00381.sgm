<P>The Occasion which made way for this Sermon is this: The Author being obliged to bestow some part of his Ministry on the French Church of Boston, until it should please God to provide for it, he was much surprised to observe that for many Sab|baths; this Church contrary to its custome, extreamly neg|lected Alms toward the Poor, which our Discipline recom|mends at the conclusion of each exercise; this made him take a resolution to Creat of this Subject, which he has done in this Sermon. The Church seem'd to be moved there|with, and some particular persons acquitted the Author to give it them to publish, which one of them now does.</P>
<P>Moreover, if it appear in English, it is not because we have a mind to trespass on the Rights of others, but 'tis be|cause it was impossible here to Print it in its natural Congue: however it will produce this effect, if no other. it will manifest the Uniformity of the Doctrine of Protestants from the most distant places in the World; and that the great Traject of Sea which has a long time separated us hinders not but that in the main we may have the same Sentiments.</P>
<P>God give an happy Success to our innocent Designs.</P>

<P>I <HI>Present you with the Sermon you Requested of me, you are absolutely the</HI> Master <HI>thereof, and may do with it what you please.

<HEAD>A Prefatory Recommendation Of the SERMON, with a brief Account of the Late French Persecution. </HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>New-English</HI> Reader is here entertained with a <HI>Sermon</HI> Pronounced in the <HI>French</HI> Congregation at <HI>Boston,</HI> by a Reverend Minister of that Nation, at this time a <HI>Refugee</HI> among us; and the Doctrine therein delivered sufficiently discovers the Worthy Author to be a <HI>Christian,</HI> and a <HI>Protestant,</HI> that may challenge a Room in our best affections. It is none of my Business here to Argue in defence of every particular Notion or Expression occurring here: For if the <HI>compassionate Samaritan</HI> himself have not escaped the prophane Lashes of those exquisite Chyrurgeons, who say, <HI>Twas ill done to pour Oyl into a Wound;</HI> not considering that besides the use of common Oyl in wounds that reach not the Bone, <HI>Oil</HI> kept until the age have destroy'd the <HI>Salt</HI> of it, is one of the greatest <HI>Balsoms</HI> in the World; much more may a popular Discourse on the <HI>compassionate Samaritan</HI> meet with censures from such as love to criticise, and seek <HI>none saporem led scientiam.</HI> All <HI>I</HI> shall observe is, that as 'tis <HI>the compassionate Sa|maritan,</HI> that is here with an acceptable ingenuity Discoursed on; So with the Bowels of a <HI>compassionate Samaritan,</HI> we ought here to reflect upon the dismal <HI>Persecution,</HI> which has driven this Learned Person, and his Congregation hither. Tis a <HI>Per|secution</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="000464_0007_0FA670EF54025850">
which all the Cruelties and Butcheries perpetrated by the Children of <HI>Cain,</HI> in former Ages, hardly equal; and the <HI>Characters</HI> of it, whether we consider the beginning of it with the Banishment of the <HI>Pastors,</HI> as it were on purpose to reserve them for the approaching <HI>Resurrection</HI> of the <HI>slain Witness;</HI> or whether we consider the various kinds of Barbarity exercised by it upon the remaining <HI>Churches</HI> in Tortures which would have rendred the worst of <HI>Deaths</HI> a most easie pleasant eligible thing unto the miserable Sufferers; <HI>I</HI> say, its <HI>Characters</HI> are altoge|ther <HI>Extraordinary.</HI></P>
<P>After innumerable previous Abuses and Injuries, at the year 1680, the poor <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>France</HI> found themselves loosing all sorts of Offices, until at length not so much as a <HI>Midwife</HI> of that Religion might be allowed. The <HI>new-Converts</HI> were dis|charged from the payment of their Debts; and the <HI>Resolv'd Confessors</HI> might not sell their own Estates, to assist their escape from the Storm now breaking on them; but instead thereof, were forced to bear all the <HI>Duties</HI> and <HI>Charges</HI> of their <HI>Apostate</HI> Neighbours; And Parents were compelled to bear the Expences of a <HI>Popish Education</HI> for their own <HI>Children,</HI> whom they had ra|ther seen perishing in the Rivers of <HI>Egypt.</HI> When the project was grown ripe for it, the <HI>French Tyrant</HI> employes a vast Army of <HI>Dragoons</HI> for the afflicting and Reducing of the many scores of thousands of Protestants, whom the former Temptations had not yet overcome. The Leaders of these <HI>New Apostles</HI> first Summoned the Inhabitants of the several Towns together, to let them know, 'twas the Kings pleasure they should turn <HI>Ro|man Catholicks;</HI> and the poor people humbly Replying, <HI>That they would gladly sacrifice their Lives and Estates in the Service of the King, out their Consciences were to be disposed of, by none but God alone.</HI> These <HI>Dragons</HI> then furiously possessed themselves of the several Towns, and were every where quartered in the
<PB N="3" REF="000464_0008_0FA670F29AC9C9C0">
Houses of the Protestants, like <HI>Locusts</HI> devouring all before them. When these <HI>Monsters</HI> had wasted all the <HI>Goods</HI> of this distressed People, they then fell upon their <HI>Persons.</HI> After the most bitter Excerations, these Tormentors would hang up the poor People by their Feet, and making of great <HI>Smokes</HI> under them, would almost choak them. If then they would not Sign an Abjuration, they tossed them to and fro into great <HI>Fires,</HI> till they were almost <HI>Roasted;</HI> and sometimes plunge them down into deep <HI>Wells,</HI> till they were half <HI>Drowned</HI> there. They stript others Naked, and prick'd them with <HI>Fins</HI> and <HI>Bodkins,</HI> till they could endure no more; and others they led about by the <HI>Noses</HI> with <HI>Pincers</HI> holding of them. Some they kept waking, by cruel <HI>Punches</HI> and <HI>Noises,</HI> for ma|ny Dayes and Nights together, till they utterly thereby lost their Wits; and others that were sick they would with Drams in their Chambers give all possible vexation to. In some pla|ces they bound Men and Ravished their <HI>Wives</HI> and <HI>Daughters</HI> before their eyes: In other places they pull' off the <HI>Nails,</HI> and scorched and scalded the <HI>Feet</HI> of the more constant <HI>Con|fessors,</HI> using therewithal ten thousand other Cruelties, which none but the wit of <HI>Divels</HI> could have invented for them. And if none of these things brought the Protestants to Re|nounce the Truth of the Lord Jesus, they were cast into hor|rible Dungeons, where they pined away to Death. If any were caught making an Essay to <HI>fly away,</HI> they were treated with Cruelties more intolerable (if any could be so) than those that have been related; and never were <HI>wild Beasts</HI> pursued with such Eagerness and watchfulness, as these poor Lambs were by their Wolvish Persecutors.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, many Thousands of the Protestants, found a merciful Providence assisting of their <HI>Escape;</HI> and some of them have Arrived unto <HI>New-England,</HI> where <HI>before</HI> they
<PB N="4" REF="000464_0009_0FA670F48E15F500">
came, there were <HI>Fastings</HI> and <HI>Prayers</HI> Employ'd for them, and <HI>since</HI> they came, they have met with some further <HI>Kind|ness,</HI> from such as know how to <HI>Sympathize with their Brethren.</HI> We have cause to think, that the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of the slain <HI>Wit|nesses</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> is now very near; and if any of us have been <HI>Compassionate Samaritans</HI> towards this afflicted people, we shall Rejoice with them, in the <HI>Redemption which draweth nigh.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, as 'tis my <HI>Hope,</HI> That the <HI>English</HI> Churches will not fail in Respects to any that have endured hard Things for their Faithfulness to the Son of God; So 'tis my <HI>Prayer,</HI> That the <HI>French</HI> may not <HI>Loose what they have wrought:</HI> nor after their prodigious Trials, come forth any o|therwise, than as <HI>Gold out of the Fire:</HI> and that if any among them, have Laboured under any unhappy Distemper after all, the Ensuing Sermon may prove, not an <HI>Extream Uncti|on,</HI> but a <HI>Balsamum Samaritanum</HI> for them.</P>
<P>Farewel <HI>Reader,</HI> and since now the <HI>Compassionate Samaritan,</HI> by the Accurate Translations of an Ingenious Person, speaks <HI>English,</HI> Entertain him with the <HI>Courtesy</HI> which his Character Entitles him unto.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Luke 10. 30, 35.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And Jesus answered and said, a certain man went down from Je|rusalem to Jericho, and fell amongst Thieves, which stripped him of his Raiment, and wounded him with many wounds,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THough every Nation has an extream propensity to applaud it self, we may notwithstanding as|sert, that no one ever had so high an opinion of it self as that of the <HI>Jews.</HI> There was nothing more common amongst them than to beast them|selves to be <HI>the People of God, to have his Temple and his Laws, to be the Children of Abraham,</HI> &amp;c. and therefore they esteem|ed themselves more <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>perfect</HI> than the rest of Mankind, and the only people capable of reaching to the possession of Happiness. Jesus Christ, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> vigorously attempted the disabusing this people of these bold conceits, in sundry occasions: 'Tis this he discovers by the Conversion of the <HI>Sa|maritan Woman,</HI> (John 4.) for it then visibly appeared that the <HI>Jews</HI> were not the alone people that were called to the possession of Heaven, as they pretended. He again endea|vours to pull down their pride, (<HI>Luke</HI> 17.) by the healing the ten <HI>Leprous Persons,</HI> whereof nine were <HI>Jews,</HI> who gave not thanks to God; but only one who was a <HI>Samaritan,</HI> and testi|fied his Acknowledgments. And here likewise Jesus Christ takes accasion to disabuse them of that unjust and bold <HI>Preoc|cupation</HI>

Thus you see what is the intention of Jesus Christ in the discourse but now read unto you.</P>
<P>The first consideration which arises upon this Text is, that
<PB N="3" REF="000464_0012_0FA670F75B24E5F8">
some will forth with enquire whether it be a <HI>Parable</HI> or an <HI>History.</HI> Some say that it is an <HI>History,</HI> and this is the com|mon opinion; others hold that it is a <HI>Parable,</HI> because here are no names specified: for my own part, I account it both a <HI>History</HI> and a <HI>Parable,</HI> and that the <HI>History</HI> is the foundation of the <HI>Parable.</HI> There seems to me to be in Scripture two sorts of <HI>Parabolical Discourses;</HI> some are purely such, as the <HI>Parable</HI> of the <HI>Sower,</HI> that of the <HI>Ten Virgins,</HI> &amp;c. These are Discourses which have no reality, but are designedly invented to draw from thence some excellent Moralities. But there are other sorts of Parables which humane wisdom cannot imi|tate, and which have a character wholly Divine, these are such as are founded upon some <HI>real fact.</HI> Thus I doubt not, but that there was a bad <HI>Rich Man,</HI> a <HI>Prodigal Child</HI> and <HI>wick|ed Servants,</HI> &amp;c. Whom Christ out of Charity names not, up|on whose actions he composed those excellent Discourses which we read in the Evangelists. These sorts of <HI>Parables</HI> are so much the more considerable, as these <HI>Histories</HI> which furnish them with matter, are particular events which Provi|dence has prepared, whereon to build Heavenly Truths. This Parable here is of this number, there was then heretofore a man wounded by Robbers in the High-way of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> there was a <HI>Priest</HI> and a <HI>Levite</HI> so uncompassionate as not to suc|cour him, which through their neglect a <HI>Samaritan</HI> did. But these surprizing occurrences represented excellent Mysteries in a spiritual sense. I have then two things to examine in this Text: First I will explain the <HI>History,</HI> secondly, the <HI>Parable.</HI> On the one hand, I will show the <HI>Literal Sense</HI> which is here <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">; on the other hand, I will discover the <HI>Mystical Sense</HI> here hidden. God give us grace, that being animated by the example of this <HI>Samaritan,</HI> which we have this day set before our eyes, we may in all ways manifest our Charity
<PB N="4" REF="000464_0013_0FA670F822F24230">
towards our Neighbours, and even towards our most cruel Enemies, that so we may one day inherit eternal Life. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>God, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> has so disposed of things in this world, that he has given to men their divers Scituations; they do not all compose one and the same City; because by that means they would not enjoy the different commodities which he has dispersed throughout the divers Regions of the World: but has settled them in many Cities, between which he has placed a certain distance, that men might maintain some sort of com|merce with one another. And for the entertaining this Soci|ety, God has given to every one its advantages; thus <HI>Jerusa|lem</HI> had not the Balm nor Gardens of <HI>Jericho,</HI> neither had <HI>Je|richo</HI> the Miraculous Waters or August Temple of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> So that for mutual communication there was an High-way between these two Cities. This was also a place very proper for <HI>Robbers</HI> who do commonly make choice of the most fre|quented ways. Thus St. <HI>Jerome</HI> relates, that between <HI>Jerusa|lem</HI> and <HI>Jericho,</HI> there was a place called <HI>Adommim,</HI> which was full of Thieves, and where they ordinarily robbed Passen|gers. Thus you see that 'tis very much to the purpose (whe|ther you consider this Discourse as an <HI>History,</HI> or as a <HI>Para|ble</HI>) That Jesus Christ brings in this man going down from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to <HI>Jericho,</HI> and falling into the <HI>hands of Thieves.</HI></P>
<P>These Wretches aim'd more at his Goods, than at his Life, <HI>they stripped him.</HI> Our Habits were given to us to cover our <HI>shame;</HI> but it oftentimes happens, that we make them the matter of our P <HI> ride</HI> They are ordained to defend us against the injuries of the Weather; but through our vanity they ma|ny times become the occasions to expose us to the assaults of <HI>Robbers,</HI> these magnificent Garbs make them presume that we are in great plenty, which excites the wicked to divers temp|tations, 'tis a <HI>bait</HI> which the Devil exposes to the eyes of
<PB N="5" REF="000464_0014_0FA670FA389A43D0">
<HI>Robbers,</HI> as men lay baits for those Creatures they have a mind to surprize. These men here no sooner saw this man, cloath|ed (according to appearance) richly, but they seized him, and <HI>stripped him.</HI></P>
<P>But as we do not willingly permit the things we lawfully possess to be taken from us, so this man opposes them, he en|deavours to <HI>repel violence by violence;</HI> he makes use of his ut|most resistance to hinder the taking away his Goods; but his attempts are unprofitable, he yields to their fury, he falls <HI>wounded</HI> with many blows. It's the ordinary consequent of Theft and Robbery, that after they have a considerable time pillaged the Goods of their Neighbour, they find amongst those they unjustly rob, some, who oppose their violence with their utmost force, so that the Thieves are thereby engaged to take away the Life of those whose Goods they have a mind to enjoy. Thus <HI>Coveteousness</HI> is the fountain of all sorts of evils, 'tis the Mother of Theft, Robbery, Murther, Violence, inhu|manity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for these Wretches after they had <HI>wounded this man with many wounds, leave him half dead.</HI></P>
<P>There were two reasons moved them to go their way. The one was the <HI>danger</HI> they would be in, if found near a man whom they had a little before evilly treated with so much cruelty; they feared to be accused as the Authors of this Mur|ther, and to be punished according to their Crime. But I doubt not also but it was the horrour of their action which obliged them to remove further from this man. A Sinner who sees his Crime before his eyes, endeavours to remove it from his <HI>fancy.</HI> He loves not a <HI>sight</HI> which occasions him so many disquietments and perplexities; he turns from it as much as he can. These Wretches go their way, leaving this <HI>man half dead.</HI></P>
<P>Jesus Christ thus already begins to pull down the pride of
<PB N="6" REF="000464_0015_0FA670FE0B7E46A8">
the <HI>Jews</HI> seeing he discovers to them that between <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>Jericho</HI> such abominable actions were committed: these people could not be so holy as they boasted themselves to be, since it is evident, the High-ways were full of Murthers and Violencies. But what happened in this adventure? by chance there came down a P <HI>riest</HI> that way, and saw this man thus Murthered just expiring, and he passed by on the other side; so likewise a <HI>Levite</HI> coming to the place, and seeing him, pas|sed by on the other side of him.</P>
<P>These two were <HI>Brethren</HI> to the wounded man, of the same blood, of the <HI>same</HI> Nation, of the <HI>same</HI> Religion; and if these Wretches would do no good for <HI>Strangers,</HI> yet at least they ought to have done it for their dying <HI>Brother.</HI></P>
<P>These two men who read the <HI>Law,</HI> and expounded it every day, ought not they to have kept in mind that excellent pas|sage of Scripture, <HI>Thou shalt not hide thy self from thine own Flesh? Isa.</HI> 58. 7. Nevertheless these uncompassionate men turned away and passed on the other side.</P>
<P>Ah my Brethren! it appears from hence, that there is a great difference between the Preaching Charity, and the pra|ctising of it. God had entrusted his Oracles with this P <HI>riest</HI> and <HI>Levite;</HI> it was <HI>they</HI> who ought to have instructed others but if it be they do not what they Preach all their Discour|ses, <HI>are but as sounding-brass, and a tinkling Cymbal,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 1.</P>
<P>I know that they wanted no <HI>excuse,</HI> there is no Sinner that doth. This <HI>Levite</HI> would not have failed to say, <HI>It behoves me to hasten, that I may go and gather in the Tithes that I may be at leasure to follow my Occupation&punc; and that I may instruct my people;</HI> The other might say, <HI>I must employ my self about my Sacrifices, and present the Offerings to the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. But dost thou not know, O prophane <HI>Priest,</HI> that God says, <HI>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,</HI> Hos. 6. 6. and thou blind <HI>Levite,</HI> you
<PB N="7" REF="000464_0016_0FA670FF18D5FC88">
<HI>Tithe Mint, Annis Cummin,</HI> and neglect the <HI>weightier matters of the Law; these things oughtest thou to have done, and not to have left the other undone,</HI> Matth. 23. 23.</P>
<P>Being both <HI>Teachers in Israel,</HI> they ought to have know how to distinguish, in their <HI>Duty,</HI> that which there was <HI>Mor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> from that which there was <HI>Ceremonial;</HI> and to understand that what was <HI>Moral</HI> ought to go first. Nevertheless th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> went more upon the Observation of thei <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> than up<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> the exercise of <HI>Charity,</HI> which is an unjust preferrence. Al|so it is, when oftentimes we dispense with a <HI>Duty</HI> which contrary to our worldly interest, under pretext of another although much inferior to it; without considering that the <HI>lesser</HI> should give way to the <HI>greater.</HI> By this rule of sol<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> and true Piety, this <HI>Priest</HI> and this <HI>Levite</HI> were under an ob|ligation to have left their <HI>Tithes</HI> and their Offerings, to have Relieved this poor Wretch.</P>
<P>Behold a <HI>Samaritan</HI> far better instructed in the <HI>Law of Cha|rity,</HI> who passing by the same way, is toucht with Compassi|on, and drawing near to this poor dying Wretch, <HI>wound up his Wounds,</HI> &amp;c. See the difference between these two sorts of people, this <HI>Priest</HI> and <HI>Levite</HI> were persons chosen by God for the practise of this <HI>Charity,</HI> but they did it not. Oh God! <HI>What ingratitude is here?</HI> and the <HI>Samaritan</HI> on the other hand without any obligation (than that of Piety) does it; here observe, that oftentimes, those whom God calls to be <HI>Exem|plary</HI> to others do their duty the least of any.</P>
<P>But take notice hereof the excess of <HI>Charity</HI> in this <HI>Samari|tan.</HI> There was an irreconcileable hatred between these two people; the <HI>Jews</HI> and the <HI>Samaritans</HI> set up <HI>Altar against Altar. Jesus</HI> the Son of <HI>Syrac</HI> speaks on this wise. Nevertheless this <HI>Samaritan</HI> no sooner beheld this miserable Creature but he <HI>had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> He might have reasoned with himself and said,
<PB N="8" REF="000464_0017_0FA6710106164210">
If I should come near this dying <HI>man</HI> they may accuse me for <HI>killing</HI> of him, at the least they will have evil thoughts of me, because of the hatred which is between our Nations; <HI>but Cha|rity is not suspicious;</HI> he never stands to reason, because his heart is toucht, besides he might (to hinder his giving any thing to this poor wounded man) have said, I have need of it my self, I may give that which I may one day find the want of; <HI>But Charity seeks not her own interest,</HI> 1 Cor. 13. 5. She adores Providence, she causes to hope that God will make good with great advantage all those Goods which we gene|rously expend for the relief of the poor, as he did of old to the Widow of <HI>Sarepta,</HI> 1Kings 17.</P>
<P>After all, This, <HI>Samaritan</HI> in his drawing near this wounded man to relieve him, did it not out of ostentation, for he ap|pears alone on the way, but meerly from the consideration of this mans misery; many give their <HI>Alms to be seen of men,</HI> and if they come near the Poor to bestow any thing, it is through <HI>vain glory;</HI> and it is properly <HI>their ambition that gives their Alms, and not their Charity;</HI> but here it was the <HI>heart</HI> that gave, <HI>He was toucht with Compassion</HI> for the poor man.</P>
<P>It doth well appear that his pity was sincere, since it pro|duced such great effects, <HI>he bound up his wounds, pouring in Oyl and Wine, and set him on his own Beast, and brought him to an Inn, and took care of him,</HI> &amp;c. this <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Oyl</HI> the poor <HI>Sa|maritan</HI> carried with him for his own nourishment; but how dear soever his Aliments be to him, he willingly sacrifices them to the recovering this wounded man.</P>
<P>He did not as those do, who come to the poor with use|less <HI>Promises,</HI> and store of wishes, but <HI>give them nothing.</HI> Oh great abuse! This man doth not so; but coming unto him. <HI>he bound up his wounds.</HI> Behold what Charity is here <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> have commonly a loathing of such things, but <HI>Charity</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

him to go beyond all these Repugnancies of nature. He does more, <HI>he poured in Oyl and Wine.</HI> These are Remedies made use of for wounds; God having given to these two ex|cellent Creatures not only the virtues to preserve the health of a man, but also to <HI>Restore</HI> it when amiss.</P>
<P>But he stops not there, <HI>he set him on his own Beast, and brought him to an Inn,</HI> he willingly incommodes himself to ease the wounded man, he saw that his feet could not carry him, and therefore helpt him upon his Horse, and for fear least some accident should happen to him by the way, he conducted him himself, and led him to such a place as Go|vernment had established for the conveniency of <HI>Travellers;</HI> no sooner is he arrived there, <HI>but he took care of him.</HI></P>
<P>He thought himself not discharged of his duty towards this man, if through his neglect, <HI>his wounds</HI> should have been exasperated, he therefore looks to him afresh.</P>
<P>But being obliged to depart on <HI>the morrow, he took two|pence, and gave them to the Host, and said unto him, take care of him, and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will Repay thee.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Samaritan</HI> you see spared nothing, no, not that which men love most, his <HI>mony</HI> he paid the Host; he recommends the wounded person to his care, and promises at his return to make him a full payment for all the time that he should be with him. How excellent a period hath Charity? how ge|neral? how Distinguished? every thing in it contributed to the benefit of this poor wretch; with his <HI>heart</HI> he was moved to compassion, with his hands he bound up his wonnds, with his feet he drew near to relieve him, with his <HI>mony</HI> he paid for him, and left <HI>wherewithal</HI> afterward for his entertainment.</P>
<P>Second Part. Beloved Brethren, if I had nought else in my view but what the Letter presents, I should here finish my Re|flection;
<PB N="10" REF="000464_0019_0FA67101E1B84F18">
but we must make a discovery of the <HI>mystery</HI> that is here hid, throughly to see what the Text presents.</P>
<P>And in regard thereof it may be said, that the man here represented to us going down from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to <HI>Jericho,</HI> is <HI>A|dam,</HI> coming forth of the hands of his Creator, <HI>Jerusalem</HI> here is Heaven, which is the vision of peace, the City of the great King; <HI>Jericho</HI> signifies in Hebrew an Orchard or a good smel|ling place. This was <HI>Terrestrial Paradise.</HI> This here was the estate of man in Innocency&punc; at the beginning of the world; but what happened to this man, he met <HI>with Thieves who stript him;</HI> These Thieves are his <HI>Passions</HI> which in causing him to sin. Robbed him of his Innocency; they were in his <HI>heart</HI> as in a hidden place, and therefore he had no mistrust of them; so that he fell through inadvertancy into their Snares.</P>
<P>The head of these <HI>Thieves is the Devil that Roaring Lyon, who seketh whom he may devour,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5. 8. or else in the Pro|phets tearms, <HI>which lyeth in wait secretly as a Lyon in his Den, he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his Net, Psalm</HI> 10 9.</P>
<P>How ere it was, these Thieves <HI>stript him,</HI> they took from him all those good qualities God had cloathed him withal; they spoyled him of his Original Righteousness, which incom|passed him about in his innocency as a precious <HI>Garment,</HI> and after this Loss he found himself so naked, that he went to <HI>hide himself</HI> amongst the <HI>Trees</HI> in the Garden, and sought out Fig|Leaves to cover himself, altogether ashamed of his Naked|ness.</P>
<P>But this was not all the inhumanity these Thieves exercised towards him: <HI>they wounded him with many wounds.</HI> Those are the cruel <HI>wounds</HI> that he received in his Soul, by the assault of his passions, his <HI>Understanding</HI> was darkened, his <HI>Will</HI> was corrupted, his <HI>Reason</HI> was Dethroned, and as before she was
<PB N="11" REF="000464_0020_0FA67102C0B79BE8">
<HI>Queen of the Soul,</HI> she became a Slave <HI>to the Senses.</HI></P>
<P>A very sad Estate, but yet behold worse!</P>
<P>These <HI>Thieves</HI> so evilly intreated this man that they left him <HI>half dead;</HI> this is the Condition of Man by Sin, he Languishes, he is cast down and cannot get up.</P>
<P>True it is, a man <HI>half dead,</HI> sometimes may lift up his eyes to Heaven, or stir his Arms as oftimes in strugling, but these signs of <HI>Life</HI> are but the forerunners of his <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>What then? Hath a Sinner any ability for <HI>Grace?</HI> shall we say that man in his <HI>Natural Corruption</HI> then is not <HI>Dead in Sin</HI> (as our Religion teaches;) but he is wounded, he is but <HI>half dead.</HI> This is exactly the Tale of the <HI>Pelagians</HI> and of the <HI>Jesuits.</HI></P>
<P>For Answer,</P>
<P>But First, Let me ask, Whether a man <HI>deadly wounded</HI> can heal himself? If he is left of all other succour, he must una|voidably perish. It is the same with the Sinner in his Natu|ral Estate, the <HI>Bite</HI> which the old Serpent hath made in his Heart is a mortal wound; <HI>for the wages of Sin is Death, Rom.</HI> 6. 23. He then undoubtedly perishes without the help of <HI>Grace:</HI></P>
<P>But Secondly, <HI>I</HI> say, That man is both <HI>dead,</HI> and <HI>half-dead</HI> at the same time; <HI>Dead,</HI> with regard to himself, but <HI>half|dead</HI> in regard to God. The Sinner of himself, is no more able to come out of his Estate of <HI>Natural Corruption,</HI> to the Life of <HI>Grace,</HI> than to raise himself when <HI>dead;</HI> but God can without a Miracle Regenerate this Sinner, and cause those Faculties which before were capable of nought but evil, fruit|ful in all vertuous actions.</P>
<P N="3">3. In fine we may say that man is <HI>but half-dead</HI> to Grace, inasmuch as he hath the <HI>Faculties</HI> to Repent, and a <HI>Spirit</HI> ca|pable of knowing Good, a <HI>Will</HI> that might love and do the
<PB N="12" REF="000464_0021_0FA6710356FBE170">
same; but he is <HI>dead</HI> as to the usage of these faculties; he knows not how to will to repent, this is a <HI>moral Impotency;</HI> which is so much the more Criminal, as it is fuller of Malice and Stubborness.</P>
<P>Man being in this Condition two sorts of persons approach him, but yet could not Relieve him, first a <HI>Priest,</HI> for all the Sacrifices of <HI>old</HI> in effect could never save the Sinner. <HI>The blood of Bulls and of Goats, and the ashes of a Heifer sanctified none but such as were polluted as to the Flesh,</HI> but in no wise reached the Spots of the Soul; the use of Sacrifices practised by the Nations time out of mind was more through the secret feelings of their imperfections before the Divinity, than in imitation of the People of God, they make a large Discovery of Sin, but give no help to the Sinner. They have showed the <HI>wound</HI> without binding it up, and to speak according to the sence of my Text, they came within sight, but would come no nearer; <HI>I</HI> shall say if you will, That the <HI>lawful Sacrifices</HI> might cause an <HI>hope</HI> of healing, but they give none; seeing this <HI>Priest</HI> by this wounded man one might hope that he would take compassion on him, but it was all that he did, <HI>for he passed by on the other side,</HI> and left him in his misery.</P>
<P>There came by afterward a <HI>Levite,</HI> who was no more favourable to this poor wounded man than the <HI>Priest.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Levite</HI> is the Law by the Ministry of <HI>Moses,</HI> and the works of the Law. This <HI>Levite</HI> saw well the evil, but he gave no Remedy thereto. The Law discovers sin, but takes it not away; <HI>therefore by the works of the Law, no&punc; Flesh shall be justified before God, Rom.</HI> 3. 20. <HI>but by the Law we come to the Knowledge of Sin.</HI> This <HI>Levite&punc;</HI> seeing the wounded&punc; person, went on <HI>the other side.</HI></P>
<P>But in fine, behold a <HI>Samaritan, who coming that way, went
<PB N="13" REF="000464_0022_0FA671069D747F30">
to him, saw him, and had Compassion on him.</HI></P>
<P>Jesus Christ my Brethren, is this <HI>Samaritan,</HI> that does that which the Law and the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> could not do, but why is Jesus Christ here Represented by a <HI>Samaritan?</HI></P>
<P>Answer, It may be in allusion to his Name, for <HI>Samaritan</HI> signifies <HI>Conservator;</HI> which very well agrees to our Saviour; but more than that, he was the object of the <HI>Jews</HI> hatred, <HI>Thou art a Samaritan</HI> said they to him, <HI>and hast a Devil.</HI> Where we may observe, That Jesus Christ answered, <HI>I have no Devil,</HI> but did not say, I am not a Samaritan; his infinite wisom would not Remove those thoughts they had of his be|ing a <HI>Samaritan</HI> (in some sence) because it was he which performed the function of this <HI>Samaritan.</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>This</HI> Samaritan <HI>as he Journeyed came to the place where this wounded Man was.</HI> Jesus Christ left his Countrey, which was Heaven; he appeared here below as a Traveller.</P>
<P>The <HI>Samaritan drew near,</HI> the sick man Christ <HI>draws near to us</HI> because we cannot <HI>draw near</HI> to him. <HI>He draws near to us</HI> by his Gospel, by his Sacraments, by his Grace; but he in person <HI>drew near</HI> to us when His Divine Person was joyned with the Humane Nature in Him, and that he conversed a|mongst men.</P>
<P>Thus it was that this mystical Samaritan seeing this wounded person, <HI>was moved with compassion,</HI> Jesus Christ from Heaven beholding Man-kind in perdition, is so toucht with <HI>Compassion,</HI> that he came down to help them.</P>
<P>Yea, Lord Jesus our adorable <HI>Saviour,</HI> it was thy mercy a|lone that moved thee to come down from Heaven upon the Earth for the Salvation of men (<HI>must it needs be?</HI> didst thou say, considering our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">) <HI>must it needs be, that I leave so many Sinners to perish, must it be that for the disobedience of one man, though overcome with weakness that all Mankind should
<PB N="14" REF="000464_0023_0FA6710886844620">
be Exposed to Everlasting Punishment; I have a Remedy in my power. Thus Lord thou art toucht with Compassion.</HI></P>
<P>This Divine Saviour stops not there, he undertakes the <HI>healing</HI> of the Sinner, and coming to him <HI>he bound up his wounds,</HI> those were Sins that were his <HI>Wounds,</HI> they caused in him a lively sence of <HI>Grief,</HI> and threatned him with a speedy <HI>Death:</HI> but behold, an Almighty Physitian that put to his hands, and <HI>bound up his Wounds!</HI></P>
<P>This, my Brethren, Christ did in his publishing the <HI>Law of Grace:</HI> this was the first Dressing which he applied; this of|fer of Salvation quieted a little his grief, and let him see the means to obtain Healing.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>This Samaritan pours in Oyl and Wine,</HI> the one to <HI>Cleanse,</HI> the other to <HI>Asswage;</HI> this is a Token of what Jesus Christ hath done for our Salvation. The <HI>Threatnings</HI> where|with he accompanies his Gospel is the sharp <HI>Wine,</HI> that cau|ses the horribleness of Sin to be felt; the promises which he joyns therewith, is the <HI>Oyl</HI> which sweetens our hopes. <HI>He that believes in the Son hath life eternal,</HI> John 3. 35&punc; behold the <HI>Oyl</HI> which asswages the Wound; <HI>He that believes not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him:</HI> here you see the sharpness of the <HI>Wine;</HI> Jesus Christ at the beginning of his Dispensation, applied this <HI>Wine,</HI> by the Ministry of <HI>John</HI> Baptist, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3. <HI>Generation of Vipers, who hath forewarned you to fly from the wrath to come?</HI> and himself applies the <HI>Oyl</HI> in his <HI>Blessings,</HI> Mat. 5. where he intends the true happiness of Christ in us. This is the way&punc; which God takes for the <HI>healing</HI> of every Sinner. Hence <HI>David</HI> was so extreamly Censued by <HI>Nathan,</HI> 2 Sam. 12. he presently denounces the
<PB N="15" REF="000464_0024_0FA6710A0AEE7E10">
judgments of God; behold the <HI>Wine,</HI> which is poured in the <HI>wound;</HI> but afterwards he declares to him that God had re|ceived him to mercy. That is the <HI>Oyl</HI> which asswages the bitterness of Soul in this poor Sinner.</P>
<P>Again, What doth not this <HI>Samaritan</HI> do for this wounded person; he alights from his Horse and helpt him on his Beast&punc; Christ was <HI>Abased</HI> to advance us, he made himself <HI>poor</HI> to make us <HI>rich,</HI> he came down from the highest degree of glory, to raise us <HI>up;</HI> he was <HI>King</HI> of the World, and of the Church, and yet took on him the form of a <HI>Servant,</HI> for to make us <HI>Kings to</HI> God his father; he became <HI>mortal</HI> and a <HI>Sufferer,</HI> for to make us <HI>mortal</HI> and <HI>glorious;</HI> in a word he suffered <HI>Death</HI> to give us <HI>life,</HI> according to the Oracle of the Prophet, <HI>By his stripes we are healed,</HI> Isa. 53. 5.</P>
<P>The Samaritan conducted the wounded person to an <HI>Inn;</HI> This is the Christian <HI>Church;</HI> which is the refuge of Sinners. There it is where all are free to enter, whether <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Greek.</HI></P>
<P>Without any distinction, such places were appointed for the relief of Travellers, and they were no sooner come into those publick places but they washed their feet, <HI>Gen.</HI> 18. 4. 'Tis in the Christian Church that the Sinner finds Relief of his troubles, here it is where <HI>not only his Feet but his hands and his head is washed, &amp;c. John</HI> 13. 9. 'Tis in the Christian Church also where he is nourished with the word of God, &amp; his Sacraments, that is the Manna which the faithful that Travel in the Desart of this World are fed with in <HI>this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></P>
<P>There it is in fine where <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> takes care of the Sin|ner, 'Tis in the Christian Church where he bestows his ne|cessary
<PB N="16" REF="000464_0025_0FA6710A285397D8">
Remedies for their Spiritual Maladies, there he ap|plies the vertue of his merit, and Displays the <HI>Efficacy of his Grace;</HI> there he bestows the Balm of <HI>Gilead,</HI> which are the Consolations of his Spirit, his Merit justifies the Sinner, his Grace regenerates him, his Spirit comforts and fills him with <HI>Joy unspeakable;</HI> and so the Sinner comes to be healed.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> was sensible of his need thereof, Psalm 51. <HI>Purge me with Hysop, and I shall be clean;</HI> saith he, verse 9. <HI>Wash me, and I shall be whiter than Snow;</HI> he had in his thoughts the Sacrifice and precious. Blood of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to blot out his sins, in verse 10. he begs of God, <HI>to Create a clean heart in him,</HI> 'twas his Grace&punc; which he desired to sanctifie him; in verse 12. he beg to receive of him the <HI>Joy of his Salvation,</HI> which is the consolation which a Sinner enjoys, who knows that his sins are forgiven him.</P>
<P>But the better to show the degrees of the love of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> in its utmost extent, we need only to observe what he further does for the Sinner; <HI>on the morrow when he departed, he took out two-pence, and gave them to the Host;</HI> he paid our Debt, in discharging our sins, he satisfied the justice of God for us, <HI>he gave himself a ransome for us,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 6. Our sins are real <HI>Debts</HI> according to the Idea of our Saviour in his Divine Prayer, (or if you will) Death is our <HI>Debt,</HI> for it is what the Law violated did require, Gen. 2. 17. <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> in undergoing it for us paid our Debt, which he did before his <HI>departure into the Heavens,</HI> before he entred into his own Man|sion, when he dyed upon the <HI>Cross.</HI></P>
<P>After which he recommends his Children unto the <HI>Host,</HI> bidding him to take care of them.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="17" REF="000464_0026_0FA6710ADFD615E0">
1. He recommends them to the Holy Ghost, in whose hands he left them; he prayes him to comfort them,, to bind up their wounds, and to sanctifie them, <HI>take care of them:</HI> He recom|mends them also unto God his Father, which he did in a most authentick manner, in that fervent prayer in the 17<HI>th</HI> of St. <HI>John,</HI> and chiefly the 11<HI>th</HI> verse, <HI>Holy Father,</HI> sayes he, <HI>Keep in thy Name these whom thou hast given me, to the end they may be one as we are;</HI> &amp;c. and finally he recommends them to the Ministers, to whom he hath given his Keys, his Word and Sacraments, <HI>that Wine, and that Oyl</HI> that closeth up the wounds of sinners: Yes it is to us that you are recommended, my Brethren, we are your <HI>Hosts,</HI> you lodg in our hearts, you are nourished by the Word which we Preach, comforted by our Exhortations, healed by our Spiritual Medicines.</P>
<P>Jesus Christ concludes with this engagement, <HI>All that thou spendest more when I come again I will repay thee.</HI></P>
<P>Jesus Christ must come in a&punc; short time <HI>to render to-each ac|cording to his works</HI> (Rom. 2. 6.)</P>
<P>But he here respects particularly the reward he will give to his Servants, he will give to his Ministers what they have been out over and above; Tis to what the other parable an|swers in <HI>Mat.</HI> 25. 14.&mdash;&mdash;30. of those Servants that impro|ved&punc; the Talents their Lord intrusted them withal, he caused them to enter into his joy, and confirmed them in greater Authority than they had before, according to that maxime of our Recompensor, <HI>To him that hath shall be given,</HI> whosoever then shall have an overplus of his Talents, shall receive so much the more. Tis in the same sence he here promises to restore to his <HI>Servants the overplus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="000464_0027_0FA6710BE9E29C48">
But what the Ministers of the Gospel are they able to give any <HI>overplus,</HI> to the sufferings of the Saviour of the World? he has by his Death discharged our Debts, and yet nevertheless he tells his Ministers, that if in his absence, that is, since his Ascention into Heaven, they bestow any thing <HI>overplus,</HI> he will restore it to them again at his coming at the last day: Do we then say with the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that the Saints and the Martyrs by their works of <HI>Superarogation</HI> have made as it were an addition to the Sufferings of Jesus Christ, and that it is this <HI>overplus,</HI> the Lord here promises to com|pensate?</P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> God forbid, Brethren, for that is to associate the creatures with the Creator, this is to make of the Saints and Martyrs so many Mediators and Redeemers, and finally would make God beholding to Men, because at this rate they would perform more than they owe.</P>
<P>Rather let us say, my Brethren;</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That we must not alwayes so strongly press all the Expressions in Parables, and that these sort of mystical Dis|courses having their Foundation on apparent or true History; sometimes there are circumstances that are particular to the History, and which by consequence appertains only to it, which would be folly to apply them to the Parable, according to their signification. Such may this here be, which attri|butes to the Servants of God, the giving an <HI>overplus</HI> beyond the sufferings and merits of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>But Secondly, Altho we should take this Tearm as apper|taining
<PB N="19" REF="000464_0028_0FA6710DE6E25880">
to the Parable we may very fitly explain this Over|plus, to be the Sufferings of the Servants of Jesus Christ, which so strongly confirm the Faithful, in the same sence, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> said, That he fulfilled in his Body <HI>the rest of the Suf|ferings of the Lord Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>Christ having purchased the Church by his Blood, St. <HI>Paul</HI> by his assured holy Conquest to Jesus Christ; Christ Dyed for the Salvation of Mankind, and St. <HI>Paul</HI> dyed for the con|firmation of that Truth. 'Tis the same thing here. The care which the Servants of God take for the Strengthening of the Faithful, whether by their constancy, or by their Doct|rine &amp; vertue, passes for the <HI>Overplus</HI> of the Sufferings, and of the care of Jesus Christ for the Salvation of the Faithful, to whom he promises an ample reward at the last Day. You see by this time my Brethren, the excellency of this Parable. 'Tis a full Representation of Divinity. 'Tis an Abridgment of Religion, which contains in gross all the most important Mysteries of our Salvation; here we see the slate of Inno|cence, the Fall of Man, the birth of Sin, its Empire, it Consequences, the means of Salvation, the Law of Grace, the Merit of Jesus Christ, his cares for the Church, his co|ming in Weakness, and his coming in Glory. Here the Ad|mirable Wisdom of our Saviour appears, that in one Parable, (and that a very short one) he encloses all the Mysteries of Religion; here we may distinguish the Masters work from that of the Servants. But it is time to conclude.</P>

<P>Let us my Brethren, make some Reflections on the four sorts of person, which here present themselves; you see here first, a man wounded, Secondly, The Thieves that assaulted

In Beholding this man Lying by the way so cruelly Murdered, you will be apt to Bemoan and Deplore his hard hap, Sinners, and yet you little think that you your selves are that <HI>man;</HI> seek then after no other Subject of your Com|plaints than your selves, and as <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> said to the Inha|bitants of <HI>Jerusalem, Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me, but weep for your selves.</HI> One may say here the same thing to you: Miserable Mortals, bewail not the hap of this poor wounded person, but bewail your own; Sinners, consider then your miserable condition, you are this man <HI>half dead,</HI> and strecht out by the way. 'Tis you that sin hath mor|tally wounded, you were born, and you live in this Estate; and that which is more to be Lamented is, that though this misery be so great, yet we know it not. The pride of men carries them for the most part to believe they are able of themselves to come forth of this Calamity, and that they have strength enough to raise themselves out of that conditi|on; no, no, my Brethren, that is not in the least the Truth of the Fact. Quit your selves of these unjust and bold Sen|timents, Free-will is but a Chimera that cheats almost none but the followers of Antichrist, to discover the vanity of these pretentions, you need only consult your own expe|rience. How many times have you undertook the overco|ming your passions without ever prevailing? Sinners, do you not perceive in your hearts an invincible torrent of corrup|tion? Assure your selves, that you are in no capacity to suc|ceed without the Assistance of Heaven; acknowledge then the necessity of Grace, implore with humility the Efficacy of the holy Ghost; never appear before God without a lively feeling of your misery, and if you find in you any good Dis|position, give all the glory thereof to God</P>

There are also some certain steps that the Sinner must make for to prepare a way for grace; he must be found in the way, which he doth, when he is found hearing the Word of God, in Gods House; and when he gives attention to the Preachings of his Ser|vants, and when he implores help from God for his Conver|sion, and when he fervently desires the same: Oh then it is that he is powerfully assisted, and receives the impressions of Grace; <HI>Seek and you shall find, Knock and it shall be opened unto you,</HI> (<HI>Mat.</HI> 7. 7.)</P>

But if you should agree with me, that you are that man <HI>half dead,</HI> overthrown by the way side, I am sure you will not so easily conclude, who are the other persons of the second Rank, you'l say without doubt, that it is none of you that were these infamous Robbers that Assassinated this man, you abhor their action, yet permit me to tell you, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> are the persons again, of whom mention is made in the se|cond

place. Yes, it is you Sinners (in a sence) that are these Thieves; suffer me to say of this Parable, as <HI>Nathan</HI> said of his to <HI>David, 'Tis thou that art the man,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam</HI> 12.</P>
<P>This offends you, but have patience a little, and see the proof. Thou slanderer that Rendest thy Brother in secret, thou ought not Refuse to be put in this Rank, dost not thou in a sence Murther thy Brother by thy Calumnies? These are stabs thou piercest him withal, stabs without doubt more cruel, than the wounds of the Body, since thou assaultest his honour, which is more dear to him than his life.</P>
<P>Revengful person! thou that seekest all occasions to be re|venged on thy Brother, and that keepest an implacable ha|tred in thy heart against him. <HI>Thou art a Murderer of him,</HI> in the opinion of a great Apostle, John 3. 15.</P>
<P>Unjust Merchant! Thou deservest to be placed in this Rank, thou who makest use of a thousand Frauds, and a thousand subtile shifts in thy Dealing, to enjoy the Goods of thy Brother, ah in so doing thou Robbest him. I tell thee then, as <HI>Nathan</HI> said to <HI>David, Thou art the man.</HI></P>
<P>Wretched Father! Thou oughtest to be put into the num|ber of these Robbers; thou who by thy Debauchery or Idle|ness, causest those which God hath given thee to bring up, to dye with Hunger, thou Stickest a Dagger in their bosoms, since by thy evil management, thou reducest them it may be in their necessities to seek their Livings by unlawful ways: Thou art this Thief, since thou takest from them, that which God hath appointed for their subsistance; to wit, thy Labour and pains, but thou art a far worse Robber, and more cruel Murtherer by thy fatal Example. I say to thee once again, <HI>Thou art the man</HI></P>
<P>Finally, We will put amongst this Troop of Robbers and Murderers, those Wretches who bare away the Goods&punc;
<PB N="23" REF="000464_0032_0FA67113D7BBE998">
of their Brother by Gaming: And I positively assert, That there is no person, who gives his mind to Gaming, but forms a resolution to rob his Neighbour, I speak not here of those slights and cheats that accompany Gaming, I speak of that which is the most innocent in these sort of things (if at least one may say, there is any thing innocent in them) which is, that each Gamester purposeth to win, and one of necessity must win, behold the Robbery, according to the Law of right, which defines Robbery, <HI>by enjoying the Goods of another contrary to the will of the Possessor;</HI> so that following this Maxime, wherever there are two Gamesters, there are two Thieves, the one by inclination, the other real and Effective: because he which loses, desires to win, and would not willingly see his mony in the others hands.</P>
<P>But you will say, I am no High-way Robber, as those were who assaulted this poor man; you are not High-way Robbers, it is true, but is your cruelty the less extream, is he that stabs another without giving him warning, or in embrce|ing him less criminal, than he that kills by open Force or Threats.</P>
<P N="3">3. But another will say, I am none of these Thieves and Murderers, since I am no calomnator, nor Gamester, nor De|bauched, nor Revengeful, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I do no hurt to any; thou bad <HI>Christian,</HI> it is not sufficient not to do evil, but thou must also do good: the bad rich Man was not in Hell for doing evil to <HI>Lazarus,</HI> but it was because he did no good to him. This Priest and this Levite will very well shun the judgment of God in that they killed not this Man; but I know not whe|ther they will escape punishment for not relieving him when they might have done it: this <HI>I</HI> know of a surety, that libe|rality is one of the principal points on which Jesus Christ will examine Men at the last day, and that hard heartedness to|wards

the Distressed will be motive sufficient for Damnation: <HI>I was an hungry and you gave me not to eat, thirsty and you gave me not to drink, I was a stranger and you took me not in,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Depart from me you cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</HI> Mat. 25. 41, 42. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I</HI> make no doubt but you will consent with me in this, and in your heart blame this want of Charity in the Priest and Levite, who passed by without succouring this poor man: but you consider not that every day you do the same; all those times that you know the necessity of your Brethren and do not concern your selves about the remedy thereof, do not say that you know not any that are poor and indigent, or that have need of your help, Ah! have you not them every day before your eyes? many whom the Robbers of Persecution has reduced almost to the condition of this poor wounded man in my Text (that is to say) who are <HI>half dead</HI> with mi|series, for they cannot properly be said to live that are in such a condition: they may be said to be half dead. How many times have you passed by them with an heart as indiffrent as this Priest, and this Levite shewed to this wounded man, not|withstanding, they are your Brethren, of the same blood, of the same Nation, of the same Religion. Ah my Brethren! you ought to lay their poverty to heart, since it is caused for the best of all causes in the World, to wit, <HI>that of Jesus Christs:</HI> how much should that move us since thereby Christ presents occasion to us to exercise our Charity in such man|ner as may be most agreeable to God (<HI>Gal.</HI> Chap. 6. ver. 10. how much should it animate us! since it confirms us in our holy Profession, for so many persons would not expose themselves to such harsh miseries, and all for a lye. Brethren, you that have saved something from this Shipwreck have compassion according to your Ability. Let it be known
<PB N="25" REF="000464_0034_0FA671177ACC2B78">
that the same interest inspires you in your mutually assisting one the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. But <HI>Christians,</HI> limit not your Charity only to your Brethren, else what do you more than the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Pagans,</HI> Do good to all even to your very Enemies, Imitate this Samaritan towards this Jew. These two Nations (as you know) hated one another mortally, and were of different Religions; nevertheless this Samaritan passes all that by, and shows to this poor afflicted man, all the good Offices he was capable to perform. Let the very seeing the mise|rable, suffice you for the finding objects worthy your pity.</P>
<P><HI>And for to overcome the utmost Efforts of the hard-heartedness of Mankind; remember what Jesus Christ hath done for you, he stript himself of his glory, be made himself poor and miserable, yea mortal, for the Love he bore to you, will you then refuse to give him some small portion of your Temporal Goods?</HI> for in as much as you give it unto one of these little Ones, you give it unto him, Mat. 25. 40. <HI>The poor are the Treasurers of Je|sus Christ&punc; he charges to his own account that which you bestow on them, and he will largely pay you the Interest another Day. If you advance some part of your Goods to the poor, he will Restore you an hundred fold</HI> in the world to come.</P>
<P><HI>He will do much more, he hath promised to give you Heaven for a cup of cold Water. Of all the Goods you possess, you shall carry nothing with you&punc; you shall have nothing Remaining to you, but what you have (as it were) Deposited into the hands of our Lord,</HI> Then make to your selves Friends of this corruptible Riches, so that when you fail, they may receive you into Everlasting Habitations. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the Adorable Trinity, be Honour and Glory, for ever, AMEN.</HI></P>
