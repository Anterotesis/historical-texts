<P>When You were a few years ago, becoming like the Primitive Believers for Your <HI>One Ac|cord,</HI> and Embracing each other, with the Ho|nourable Name of, UNITED BRETHREN; the <HI>Tidings were as cold waters to our thir&s;ty Souls,</HI> in this far Countrey, and the <HI>Tidings</HI> were pro|clamed, and Received with <HI>Joy,</HI> throughout the Churches, in the&s;e <HI>American</HI> Colonies. But I will take the Leave to Tran&s;cribe and Report unto you, &s;ome words, of the Di&s;cour&s;e here publi&s;hed Eight years ago, on that memorable Occa&s;ion.
<Q><HI>Satan</HI> will doubtle&s;s endeavour to undermine this UNION: A certain King of <HI>England,</HI> holding a Treaty of Peace, with a <HI>French</HI> King, in an old Chappel that lay be|tween their two Armies, both came to a good Agreement; but as they were coming out of the Chappel, a <HI>Snake</HI> &s;uddenly crept out of the old Wall, which they &s;eeing, Drew their Swords, and their Servants at the Door Drew likewi&s;e: Upon this, the whole Armies no le&s;s furiou&s;ly than ignorantly advanced upon one another, and Commenced a Battel, wherein a mo&s;t horrid Slaughter was made, before the mi&s;take was Rectified. Alas, it often thus comes to pa&s;s;<NOTE PLACE="marg">[<HI>Ble&s;sed &V;nions page</HI> 85, 86. <HI>Printed</HI> 1692.</NOTE> when the Servants of God have been ju&s;t Fini&s;hing a <HI>Reconciliation</HI> the <HI>Old Serpent</HI> will interpo&s;e, &amp; interrupt it all.</Q></P>

With a very condolent <HI>Sympathy,</HI> we feel the Blowes, which the Two <HI>Sticks,</HI> that we thought <HI>made One,</HI> are giving to one another.

<Q>Among per|&s;ons, who agree in the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of the Doctrine, there is &s;ome Difference about the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> whereby we are Ju&s;tified, with its proper <HI>Object</HI> in Ju&s;tifying, and its <HI>&V;&s;e</HI> in Ju&s;tification.

<P>THE <HI>Ju&s;tification of a Sinner,</HI> in the Sight of God, being a matter of greate&s;t Importance, and Concern|ment to the Souls of men; it hath been the Practice of the Mini&s;ters of <HI>New-England,</HI> (according to my Ob&s;ervation) from the Beginning, frequently to acquaint their People with, or to in&s;i&s;t upon the true Doctrine of <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> according to the word of GOD; and the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of our Faith, and concurrence of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Divines and Churches in other parts of the World: and for divers of the mo&s;t Eminent of the fir&s;t Mini&s;ters to leave upon record the &s;ame Doctrine in their Printed works for the benefit of Po&s;te|rity; Such as Mr&punc; <HI>Hooker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Richard Mather,</HI> Mr. <HI>Chaney,</HI> Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> and Mr. <HI>Norton</HI>: in which Practi&s;e they have been followed by the Mini&s;ter who have &s;ucceeded them: As there was a very u&s;eful Di&s;cour&s;e of Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> on Ju&s;tification, Publi&s;hed &s;ome few years ago; So here is now pre&s;ented to the Readers view, another little Treati&s;e on the &s;ame Subject&punc; containing <HI>no other Doctrine of Justification, then

<P>It is true indeed that in our fir&s;t times and for &s;ome few years, the <HI>Peace</HI> of the&s;e Churches was di&s;turbed by a Company of real <HI>Antinomi|ans,</HI> who zealou&s;ly crying up the <HI>free Grace</HI> of God, and the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of Chri&s;t for <HI>Justifi|cation</HI>; but gro&s;sly neglecting, &s;lighting and vilifying the Graces and Duties of <HI>Sanctification,</HI> they made their folly appear unto all men, and their Religion quickly came to an end. For by their general removal out of this Colony to <HI>Road-I&s;land</HI> (a place where they might every one <HI>do what was right in their own eyes</HI>) they &s;hew|ed them&s;elves to be meer <HI>Libertines,</HI> and down|right <HI>Worldlings:</HI> contenting them&s;elves with the accommodations of a fruitful I&s;land, they ca&s;t off the very <HI>Form of Religion</HI>; they and their Po&s;terity (for the generality of them) living about the&s;e three&s;core years pa&s;t, without any <HI>Churches, Mini&s;ters, Ordinances,</HI> or keeping of the <HI>Lords Day,</HI> only profe&s;&s;ing <HI>Liberty of Con|&s;cience</HI> at large, that men might there be of <HI>any Religion</HI> or <HI>no Religion,</HI> as they would them|&s;elves: this is notoriou&s;ly known to all <HI>New-England.</HI> So dreadfully dangerous it is to <HI>turn the Grace of God into Wantonne&s;s,</HI> and to pervert the Doctrine of <HI>Ju&s;tification.</HI></P>
<P>After that Storm was over, and ever &s;ince (in my Ob&s;ervation) the Mini&s;ters and Chur|ches of <HI>New-England</HI> have retained and maintain|ed

the true Doctrine of <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> with an equal care of the true Doctrine &amp; Practice of <HI>Sanctifica|tion</HI> to be forever joyned with it; profe&s;&s;ing al&s;o and proclaiming to all men, that we take the <HI>Law</HI> of God in his <HI>Ten Commandments</HI> to be the <HI>Rule of Life</HI>; and yet &s;o, as to Fence again&s;t the other Extream of E&s;tabli&s;hing any <HI>Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of our own,</HI> which is equally dangerous to the Souls of men, and which we all naturally and habitually are enclined to, &s;eeking to be Ju&s;tified, either by works without Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;t, or &s;ome way or other joyning them with Chri&s;t.

<P>A man cannot be <HI>Righteous</HI> before God, and Accepted and Entitled unto Life, without the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God</HI> Imputed unto him.</P>
<P>Now, to &s;et this All concerning Truth, in a fair View before you all, it mu&s;t be in general premi&s;ed, <HI>That Righteou&s;ne&s;s is that full conformity and Obedience unto the Law of God, which gives a Right unto the Benefits, that are promi&s;ed unto &s;uch Obedience.</HI></P>

<PB N="5" REF="000923_0037_0FACA333B1AF0650">
And &s;o we read, in Gal. 3.10. <HI>Cur&s;ed is E|very One that continueth not in all Things.</HI></P>
<P>We are to know, That the <HI>Commandment</HI> given by God unto man, in that <HI>Covenant,</HI> is the <HI>Rule of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> That <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> whereon is our Claim to <HI>Happine&s;s,</HI> mu&s;t needs relate unto &s;ome <HI>Rule</HI> or other.

<P>We are to know finally, That man by Sin|ning again&s;t the <HI>Commandment</HI> of God, is fallen &s;hort of <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Truly, No man is able to come up Exactly unto the will of God, in any one Point of the <HI>Law</HI>; but his <HI>Carnal mind</HI> is full of <HI>Enmity</HI> again&s;t that Will.

<PB N="68" REF="000923_0100_0FAD3CE4CE5C21D8">
no <HI>Interci&s;ion.</HI> Let a Sinner be <HI>once Ju&s;tified,</HI> and Ab&s;olved from the Sentence of the <HI>Law</HI> upon him, he is then <HI>wholly</HI> &s;o, and <HI>ever</HI> &s;o.</P>
<P>But for all this, Let it not &s;eem Strange unto you, if I tell you, That there is what we may call, a <HI>Filial Guilt,</HI> wherein a <HI>Justifyed</HI> Per&s;on may become obnoxious to the <HI>Fatherly Wrath</HI> of God. It is an un&s;ound Po&s;ition in certain Sermons too much cryed up, among Injudicious Readers; <HI>Though a Believer, after he be a Believer, do Sin often, yet God no longer Stands Offended and Di&s;plea&s;ed with him.</HI></P>
<P>You may thus Conceive of it.</P>
<P>The God of Heaven ha's in the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> Required us to <HI>Adorn the Doctrine of God our Sa|viour,</HI> by Endeavouring utmo&s;t <HI>Obedience</HI> to that <HI>Law,</HI> which our <HI>Saviour</HI> hath an&s;wered for us. And He ha's Threatned our <HI>Gro&s;ser Neglects</HI> of that <HI>Obedience,</HI> not with <HI>Eternal Confu&s;ion,</HI> as He did in the <HI>Law</HI>; but with <HI>Paternal Correction.</HI> The <HI>Paternal Correction</HI> whereto our <HI>Scandalous Faults,</HI> will now Ex|po&s;e us, lies in a Variety and Severity of <HI>Divine Judgments,</HI> to be di&s;pens'd in <HI>this World</HI> unto us. The <HI>Divine Judgments,</HI> under which we may fall, by our Falls into Rebellion again&s;t our <HI>Heavenly Father,</HI> are both <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Temporal</HI>&punc; The <HI>Spiritual Judgments,</HI> which Godly men may by their Sins bring upon them&s;elves, are <HI>Internal De|&s;ertions,</HI>

wherein the Spirit of God witholds Influences of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> from them. The <HI>Temporal Judgments,</HI> are <HI>External Afflictions</HI>; And e&s;pecially &s;uch as carry Notable <HI>Retaliations</HI> in them. One <HI>End</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Judgments,</HI> is to Amend, and Reform, and cure the mi&s;carriages of Godly Men, and promote a Due <HI>Repentance</HI> in them: And yet another <HI>End</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Judgments,</HI> is, to vindicate the <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and make all that &s;aw the Mi&s;carriages of tho&s;e Godly men, to &s;ee that the <HI>Lord of the Holy Angels,</HI> will allow no &s;uch Things, in any that belong unto Him. When Godly men, have by any piece of notorious <HI>&V;ngodline&s;s,</HI> Laid them&s;elves open to the&s;e <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, their way to be Saved from the <HI>Judgments,</HI> is to plead the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t over a|gain, and thereon penitently to <HI>Confe&s;s</HI> and <HI>For&s;ake</HI> all that has been Ami&s;s.
