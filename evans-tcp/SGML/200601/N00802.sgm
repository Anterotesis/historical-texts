<P>ON what occa&s;ion this <HI>P&s;alm</HI> was pen|ned, we are not told. It evidently appears, by the matter of it, that it was when the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> had been un|der &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s of mind, by rea&s;on of the deep &s;ence of his Sin, and was relieved by God; and it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that it bears a reference

<P>The <HI>Title</HI> of the <HI>P&s;alm</HI> is, <HI>Ma&s;chil of David</HI>; the word &s;ignifieth, <HI>to Teach</HI>: Some think it here intends a &s;ort of <HI>Instrument</HI> that bare this name: Others, that it points to the kind of Song &s;uited to &s;uch a Tune, according to the numbers or mea&s;ures of it. But generally it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the matter of the P&s;alm is pointed to in it; <HI>viz.</HI> that it is a <HI>P&s;alm for teaching or in&s;truction.</HI> There are &s;ome of <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> others <HI>Petitionary,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Hi&s;to|rical, &amp;c.</HI> But this is Doctrinal; and the matter of it excellently &s;uits to this interpretation; and there are ten others be&s;ides this that bear the &s;ame in&s;cription.</P>
<P>The Doctrine that is laid down in this <HI>P&s;alm</HI> is one; i. e. <HI>to point us to the way how we may come to be truly happy,</HI> where we have</P>
<P N="1">1. A Ble&s;&s;ed man de&s;cribed, <HI>ver&s;.</HI> 1, 2.</P>

<P N="3">3. He directs how to improve the faith of this, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 6, 7.</P>

<P N="5">5. Calls on the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed men to rejoyce in it, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 11.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing then in the P&s;alm, is a de&s;crip|tion given of a ble&s;&s;ed man, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 1, 2. And it
<PB N="9" REF="000965_0008_0FADE69BE8BBAC60">
bears re&s;pect to the &s;tate of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s which is enjoyed in this life. There is an <HI>Inchoate Felicity</HI> which the Children of God are partakers of here, which &s;hall arrive at perfection hereafter. The <HI>Topick</HI> from whence he argues or de&s;cribes this <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s,</HI> is the &s;tate of Pardon or Forgive|ne&s;s in which &s;uch do now &s;tand.</P>
<P>In the words ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. The ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of &s;ome is a&s;&s;erted; <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> Interpreters are at a lo&s;s about the word. Some make it an <HI>Adverb,</HI> &s;ignifying, <HI>well: q. d. it &s;hall be well with &s;uch an one.</HI> Others an <HI>Adjective</HI> of the plural, &s;ignifying, <HI>That all manner of felicities belong to &s;uch an one, both in this life, and that to come.</HI> The word certainly denotes an happy &s;tate, and tells us, that there is in it the affluence of all the good that is de&s;irable; and the P&s;almi&s;t gives us to under&s;tand that there are &s;uch men as the&s;e in the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. This ble&s;&s;ed man is characterized; he is a <HI>pardoned man</HI>: where,</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P N="1">1. The pardoned man is one <HI>who&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is forgiven.</HI> The word, <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> &s;ignifies a

<HI>proud&punc; rebellious, wilful breaking of the Law; or high-banded iniquity</HI>; and the word, <HI>Forgiven,</HI> &s;ig|nifies <HI>to take off from one</HI>; and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Metaphor from a burden which oppre&s;&s;eth one, by the removal whereof he is ea&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">2. He is one <HI>who&s;e &s;in is covered</HI>; the word, <HI>Sin,</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>an erring, or turning out of the right way</HI>; and is applicable to all Sin what&s;oever, which is <HI>Anomy,</HI> 1 Joh. 3.4. the word, <HI>Covered,</HI> &s;ignifies, <HI>to hide a thing, by throwing &s;omething over it, that it may not be &s;een</HI>; and is a metaphor from the covering of na&s;ty dirty things, that one is not willing &s;hould be taken notice of.</P>
<P N="3">3. He is one <HI>to whom the Lord imputes not ini|quity</HI>; the word, <HI>Iniquity,</HI> &s;ignifies that which is <HI>crooked or perver&s;e</HI>; and is &s;ometimes u&s;ed to ex|pre&s;s <HI>Original Sin,</HI> which is the crookedne&s;s of our nature; and is often al&s;o applied to <HI>Actual Sin,</HI> which is called mans <HI>crooked way</HI>; and the word tran&s;lated <HI>Impute,</HI> among many other &s;ig|nifications of it is often u&s;ed for <HI>reckoning or char|ging to ones account</HI>: and Sins are &s;ometimes called <HI>Debts</HI> in Scripture.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have the evidence of this pardon &s;et down, with re&s;pect to the &s;ubject of it, he is one <HI>in who&s;e &s;pirit there is no guile</HI>; the word, <HI>Guile,</HI> &s;ignifies, <HI>fraud, fal&s;hood, and deceit</HI>; and is here taken for <HI>Hypocri&s;y,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>integrity.</HI></P>
<P>That there is a Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s which God hath provided for, and will be&s;tow upon &s;ome of the Children of men, is a truth ob&s;ervable

<HEAD>A Pardoned Man, is a Ble&s;&s;ed Man. DOCTRINE I.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Pardoned Man, is a Ble&s;&s;ed Man</HI>; That per&s;on who hath obtained at the hand of God a Remi&s;&s;ion of his &s;ins, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of true felicity; a &s;tate of forgivene&s;s, is a &s;tate of real happine&s;s&punc; I might here &s;pend &s;ome time in en|quiring into the nature of <HI>Pardon</HI>; but that will follow to be di&s;tinctly con&s;idered afterwards; here therefore let it be only in general ob&s;erved, <HI>that pardon properly con&s;i&s;ts in the removal of the Guilt of &s;in from the &s;inful creature.</HI> It ever &s;uppo|&s;eth guilt ari&s;ing from &s;in, with which the man was ju&s;tly charged, and by which he was under a Sentence of Condemnation. When this Sen|tence is taken off, and the per&s;on is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cquitted, then he is &s;aid to be pardoned. It is therefore an act of authority, done by one who hath pow|er to apply it; and that is no other but God; they &s;aid the truth in <HI>The&s;i,</HI> Mark 2.7. <HI>Who can forgive &s;ins but God only?</HI> only their charge was fal&s;e, becau&s;e Chri&s;t was God; and being
<PB N="12" REF="000965_0011_0FADE6A0342B50F0">
con&s;tituted by his Father to be Judge of all the World, he had this authority, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 10. But that which I here de&s;ign, is only to clear up the truth of the Doctrine, by e&s;&s;aying to di&s;cover the great ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of &s;uch an one as is pardoned: only ob&s;erving, that their whole ble&s;&s;edne&s;s doth not con&s;i&s;t in this; it being a collection of many things together, that are requi&s;ite to the making one compleatly happy; but this is one of them, and in&s;eparable from the re&s;t; and doth al&s;o communicate to the man that which is truly hap|pifying.</P>
<P>There are two heads to which we may refer the demon&s;tration of this truth.</P>
<P N="1">1. The evil and mi&s;ery which this pardon frees the man from, declares him to be happy. <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;ery</HI> are directly contrary each to other: that therefore which removes this from the man, re&s;tores him to that again: now this pardon hath a main &s;troak here. How this re|moves it, will be con&s;idered hereafter; we now only con&s;ider the things that it delivers the man from, and they are not only &s;eeming, but real and great mi&s;eries; it therefore mu&s;t needs be a real and great felicity. Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. It takes off the <HI>Condemnation</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> which was fallen on the Sinner; all mankind were for &s;in, condemned by the Law of God: we read therefore of unbelievers, that they <HI>are condemned already,</HI> Joh. 3.18. and this condemna|tion was according to the tenour of the Law, Gen. 2.17. <HI>Thou &s;halt &s;urely dy.</HI> This Sentence
<PB N="13" REF="000965_0012_0FADE6A0584DD128">
is pa&s;t by God on the whole race of fallen men; &amp; every unpardoned &s;inner abides under it; &amp; every &s;ort of death is contained in it; and what a fearful thing is it to &s;tand condemned? how mi|&s;erable is &s;uch an one? but as &s;oon as the pardon comes, the <HI>Condemnation cea&s;eth,</HI> Rom. 8.1. and if it never comes, it is impo&s;&s;ible for the man to &s;cape the Execution of it; he cannot break pri|&s;on; the Law mu&s;t take place: but this &s;tops the mouth of the Law, and that nothing el&s;e can do.</P>
<P N="2">2. It pacifieth the <HI>Anger of God</HI> which was out again&s;t him. Sinners are under the influence of it, and expo&s;ed to feel its terrible impre&s;&s;ions con|tinually; we read in, P&s;al. 7.11. <HI>God is angry with the wicked every day</HI>; and this proceeds from his <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> which being &s;o &s;et again&s;t Sin, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.13. makes Sinners, who are under the Guilt of Sin, the objects of his di&s;plea&s;ure; and it is a dreadful mi&s;ery to be under the anger of God, P&s;al. 76.7. <HI>Who may &s;tand in thy &s;ight when once thou art angry?</HI> but when a pardon comes, that anger is laid a&s;ide: and it brings the te&s;timony of it. God in applying of forgivene&s;s, &s;hews him|&s;elf to be atoned: and how happy did he reck|on him&s;elf on the con&s;ideration of this benefit? <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 12.1. all the mi&s;eries o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the creature are the effects of Gods di&s;plea&s;ure, how mu&s;t they then cea&s;e upon his being reconciled.</P>
<P N="3">3. It di&s;chargeth them from the <HI>Cur&s;e.</HI> There is a <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> contained in the <HI>Law-Condemnation</HI> that is pa&s;t upon the Sinner; and it belongs to all
<PB N="14" REF="000965_0013_0FADE6A11932D9F8">
that are <HI>under the Law,</HI> Gal. 3.10. and this is a mi&s;erable condition. Be&s;ides the things contain|ed in it referring to another world, which will fall under an after con&s;ideration, let us here ob|&s;erve, that in this life it is very fearful: and that ob&s;ervable on a double account. There is a <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> on all their <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings.</HI> They do enjoy ma|ny favours in this life, through the benignity of God, but there is a Cur&s;e upon them all; and that not only to remove them, but to harm them in the very enjoyment: hence that, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28.15. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and we have &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion, Mal. 2.2. <HI>I will cur&s;e your ble&s;&s;ings, yea I have cur&s;ed them al|ready</HI>; every thing doth them hurt; all tends to their di&s;advantage, <HI>Their Table is a &s;nare,</HI> &amp;c. P&s;al. 69.22. Whereas they that are pardoned, have this Cur&s;e removed from them; this is a benefit pro|mi&s;ed in, Rev. 22.3. <HI>There &s;hall be no more Cur&s;e</HI>&punc; and this flows from forgivene&s;s. There is a Cur&s;e al&s;o in their <HI>Afflictions,</HI> and that is it which puts the bitterne&s;s into them. All the Afflictions that come upon Unpardoned Sin|ners, are the Executions of the Sentence of the Law, and are di&s;pen&s;ed by God as a Judge. We read, in Eccle&s; 5.17. <HI>He hath much &s;orrow and wrath with his Sickne&s;s</HI>; in all this there is a &s;ignification of vengeance, and they come to tell men what they are to expect. But, tho' the pardoned man may meet with afflictions and &s;ore trials, yet the bitterne&s;s is taken out, becau&s;e they are, though oftentimes the fruit of <HI>anger,</HI> yet of <HI>love</HI> too, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.6. they are

<P N="4">4. It &s;tops the mouths of all <HI>accu&s;ers,</HI> and makes void all their charges. We have that demand of the Apo&s;tle, Rom. 8.33. <HI>Who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that Justifieth</HI>; an unpardoned &s;inner is liable to the clamour of every accu&s;er; and when&s;oever his Sin is charged upon him by his own Con&s;ci|ence, and the terrors of the Lord are &s;et be|fore him, he hath nothing to &s;upport him&s;elf with, but is liable to all horror and de&s;pair, being con&s;cious of his Guilt, and the Wrath that is our again&s;t him. But it is not &s;o with him that is pardoned: When his own heart tells him, that he hath been &s;uch a Sinner, and Satan endeavours to terrify him with the mo&s;t fearful repre&s;entations of Sin, and the Law, and the Wrath of God, and would fain di&s;tre&s;s him therewithal, he hath his pardon to &s;hew, Signed and Sealed by the Spirit of God: &s;o that he can think of his &s;ins with deepe&s;t aba&s;ement, and &s;oul humbling thoughts, and yet not be terrified with them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.11.</P>

Pardon of Sin brings with it all the benefits of Chri&s;t; forgivene&s;s derives to us through him, as may af|ter be particularly evidenced, it is from the Im|putation of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and &s;o it derives to us by Faith, with which we accept of, and clo&s;e in with his per&s;on: and if he be once ours, all his benefits are &s;o too; for they are in&s;epara|ble, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. if God makes him ours, he makes him all to us: and by vertue of that, all ble&s;&s;edne&s;s is made ours.

<P N="1">1. They that are pardoned are <HI>Ju&s;tified.</HI> There are two things that belong to the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner, and this is one of them: their &s;ins are forgiven, and they are adjudged righteous, and the&s;e are never parted; for, where God pardon|eth &s;in, there he imputeth Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and thence the man comes to be Ju&s;tified, &s;o the A|po&s;tle argueth, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.6, 7. and certainly, he that is Ju&s;tified is ble&s;&s;ed: for indeed, as all mi|&s;ery is rooted in Condemnation, &s;o all felicity flows from Ju&s;tification: the Apo&s;tle therefore puts them together, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.30. <HI>Whom he hath Ju&s;tified, them he hath Glorified.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Pardon of Sin layeth the foundation for all <HI>Peace</HI> in the Soul.

forgivene&s;s; <HI>peace with God,</HI> Rom. 5.1.

<P N="3">3. They that are pardoned are al&s;o <HI>Adopted</HI>; this therefore is mentioned as one great de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's Redemption, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.5. <HI>That we might receive the Adoption of Sons</HI>; hence we have them both joyned together as concomitant ble&s;&s;ings, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.4, 5. and this is a felicity which &s;urmounts our conception; the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of it as a thing out bidding all expre&s;&s;ions, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.1. the love of God appearing in it is incomparable, and they who are entituled to, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch love, cannot but be in an happy condition; <HI>How is it po&s;&s;ible that a Child of God &s;hould be mi&s;e|rable?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. They are hereupon made great <HI>heirs</HI>; this
<PB N="19" REF="000965_0018_0FADE6A8D5F5C7C8">
is inferred from the former, Rom. 8.17. <HI>If Sons, then heirs, heirs of God</HI>; and the&s;e two are put together, as being con&s;equent one upon the o|ther, Acts 26.18. <HI>To receive forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and an inheritance,</HI> &amp;c. and who can tell what are tho&s;e glorious things are contained in this Inheritance? they are the things which <HI>eye hath not &s;een, &amp;c.</HI> &s;urely the portion which Chri&s;t hath purcha&s;ed and laid in to be be&s;towed on the Children of God, is &s;ufficient to make them happy for ever; they that are owners of it cannot po&s;&s;ibly want for any thing that may give them compleat &s;atisfaction, and an&s;wer their mo&s;t enlarged cravings to the uttermo&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">5. They are made to enjoy intimate <HI>Communi|on</HI> with God. Being reconciled, they are now heavens favourites, and the Great God conde|&s;cends to have fellow&s;hip with them; what &s;aith he? 1 Joh. 1.3. <HI>Truly our fellow&s;hip is with God the Father, and with his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>; and who are they but &s;uch, and all &s;uch who&s;e &s;ins are forgiven? it was &s;in that made the <HI>wall of &s;epara|tion between God and them,</HI> I&s;a. 59.2. but now the wall is pulled down, and God <HI>delights</HI> in, and <HI>dwells</HI> with them, <HI>I&s;a</HI> 57.15. and needs mu&s;t that &s;oul be in a ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate, that hath &s;uch in|timate Communion with the fountain of all ble&s;|&s;ings and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">6. They are <HI>&s;afe</HI> from all danger; they are out of the reach of harm; their &s;tate is &s;ecure; if God once pardon, he will never condemn a|gain: if they are once in his love, they &s;hall ne|ver

be put out of it more; when they once are numbred among Children, they &s;hall never be di&s;inherited; nothing <HI>&s;hall be able to &s;eparate them from Gods love, Rom.</HI> 8.38, 39. God may be an|gry with them, but he will not reject them: if he afflict them, it &s;hall be for their good, but his <HI>kindne&s;s he will never take away,</HI> P&s;al. 89 34, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> every pardoned one may without fear, challenge that priviledge, 1 Pet. 1.5. <HI>To be kept by the power of God, through faith unto Salvation.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Their pre&s;ent <HI>joyes</HI> are truly happifying. There is that Con&s;olation flowing down to the Soul from the &s;en&s;e and apprehen&s;ion of pardon, which is ravi&s;hing; and none can tell what it is but he that hath it: <HI>a &s;tranger</HI> cannot <HI>intermeddle</HI> with it. There is &s;omething like it in a Con|demned Malefactor, when at the place of Execu|tion, terrified and amazed at the apprehen&s;ion of in&s;tant death, a pardon is &s;ent him, and he is di&s;charged; well might our Saviour preface that happy &s;entence, with &s;uch an encouragement, Mat. 9.2. <HI>Be of good cheer, thy &s;ins are forgiven</HI>; 'tis <HI>joy un&s;peakable and full of glory</HI>; and is not this ble&s;&s;edne&s;s?</P>
<P N="8">8. The pardoned &s;inner, &s;hall without doubt be made a <HI>glorious Saint in Heaven</HI> Where God begins with forgivene&s;s&punc; he will end with Glorifi|cation. It was the <HI>Salvation of Sinners</HI> that Chri&s;t came to bring about, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15. and it was to <HI>Save them from their &s;ins</HI> that he was made a <HI>Je|&s;us,</HI> Mat. 1.21. the fir&s;t &s;tep of this Salvation is when he &s;aves them from Condemnation by par|doning
<PB N="21" REF="000965_0020_0FADE6AA1AA27B40">
them; and the la&s;t is to follow in due time, which is done by be&s;towing eternal &s;alvati|on upon them; he is therefore &s;aid to be the <HI>Author</HI> of it, <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.9. and if it be &s;o, &s;hall we not pronounce pardoned men, ble&s;&s;ed men?</P>
<P><HI>USE I.</HI> Let this then &s;erve to awaken all of us to &s;eek after this pardon. There is in all a natural de&s;ire to be happy: but alas! what un|happy cour&s;es are the mo&s;t taking to obtain it? but here you are pointed to a way that will not fail, if duly attended; be then per&s;waded to fol|low this Rule; and to move you, con&s;ider.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a pardon to be had; this comfor|table news is brought to us in the Go&s;pel: we are told that <HI>there is forgivene&s;s with God,</HI> P&s;al. 130.4. yea it is one of the titles that he a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf in the Scriptures, Exod. 34.7. <HI>Forgiving iniquity, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in</HI>; and for this is he celebrated, that he is forward to apply it, P&s;al. 86.5. <HI>ready to forgive</HI>; and there is full evidence for this; for,</P>
<P N="1">1. Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath purcha&s;ed it; he came for that very end, and he hath accompli&s;hed it; there was more done for the making way for the par|don of &s;in, than in the making of the World. When Ju&s;tice had condemned the Sinner to dy, and there was no deliverance to be had, but by &s;atisfaction made to it, and there was none that could make that &s;atisfaction but a Divine Per&s;on, <HI>God &s;pared not his own Son, but gave him for us</HI>; when there was no other offering that could ex|piate
<PB N="22" REF="000965_0021_0FADE6AAECE45AF8">
this guilt, <HI>he delivered him for our offences,</HI> Rom. 4. ult. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21. and he hath paid the Redemption price; and now <HI>God may be both ju&s;t and ju&s;tify.</HI> Here lay the nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t co|ming and dying, becau&s;e &s;inners could not be &s;a|ved, unle&s;s pardoned; and they could not be par|doned unle&s;s the Law were &s;atisfied; this was the one thing that made his coming nece&s;&s;ary; and in coming he hath done it to effect, &s;o that <HI>he is able to &s;ave to the uttermost, Heb.</HI> 7.25.</P>
<P N="2">2. God freely offers this pardon where the Go&s;pel cometh. He invites the children of men to come to him that they may be forgiven; he proclaims pardon to the world, and bids them &s;eek it of him, and maketh large promi&s;es to them that &s;o do, of be&s;towing it on them; that is one great argument that he u&s;eth, when he bids men to &s;eek after him, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 1.18.55.7. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.30. and el&s;ewhere plentifully; yea, he is grieved when men will not come to him for it. It is the great provocation under the Go&s;pel, that Chri&s;t and his Salvation are neglected: and he hath put it in the directory of prayer, and made it one petition that he hath put into our mouths, Mat. 6.12. <HI>Forgive us our debts</HI>; and &s;uch as have &s;ought it, have readily obtained it, <HI>Context. Ver&s;e</HI> 5.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is never an one of us but doth infi|nitely need it; there is no doing without one for the children of men: it is therefore the greate&s;t concern that lies upon us; the fir&s;t thing we have to &s;eek after; for,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="23" REF="000965_0022_0FADE6AB94AC1188">1. We are all Sinners. This is the natural &s;tate in which all men are at fir&s;t: the fall hath brought it upon the whole race. We are Sinners by Im|putation; the great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion which our fir&s;t Parents perpetrated, when they &s;tood as publick Per&s;ons, is become ours, and we &s;tand condemned for it. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12. The defilement of nature is upon us all, that <HI>Original, in dwelling Sin,</HI> which hath depraved all our faculties and powers, and filled them with the habits of perver&s;ne&s;s. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 58.4. <HI>&amp;</HI> 51.5. And we have committed innumerable <HI>Actual Sins Gen.</HI> 8.21. So that there is a woful deal of matter for pardon in every one of us; for it is Sin that makes us to need forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. We are hereby under <HI>Guilt.</HI> Guilt is an in|&s;eparable companion of &s;in, according to the te|nour of the Law-Covenant; &s;o that as long as we are under that, we &s;tand guilty. The Law dooms every &s;inner to dy for every the lea&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of it, and <HI>Guilt</HI> is the <HI>Obligation</HI> lying on him to &s;uffer the &s;ame. <HI>Guilt</HI> is a <HI>Pri&s;on</HI> in which the &s;in|ner is &s;hut up for puni&s;hment, and he cannot break out of it; its bars and bolts are too &s;trong: and we are told that <HI>all the world are guilty before God. Rom</HI> 3.19. <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;o long as they abide under the Law.</P>
<P N="3">3. There are fearful mi&s;eries await us, by rea|&s;on of this Guilt. <HI>Guilt</HI> holds us under the <HI>Cur&s;e,</HI> and that is a tremendous thing: all the mi&s;eries of this life, and all the &s;orrows of hell are contained in it. We read of a fearful great <HI>Roll,</HI> and it was <HI>Written within and without</HI>: and what were
<PB N="24" REF="000965_0023_0FADE6AC6FF1FCA0">
the contents of it? why it was the <HI>Cur&s;e, Zech.</HI> 5. <HI>begin.</HI> No tongue can expre&s;s, no heart conceive, the wretchedne&s;s of that man who mu&s;t undergo all that is written in it: and yet this is the guilty &s;inners portion, and, whiles guilty, he cannot e|&s;cape it.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is no avoiding the&s;e mi&s;eries without a pardon: that, and only that can remove our Guilt. We cannot make &s;atisfaction; it is vain to hope or attempt it; <HI>Thou&s;ands of Rams,</HI> &amp;c. &s;igni|fy nothing here, nor can we any way fly from it, becau&s;e our Guilt keeps us clo&s;e pri&s;oners, and will drag us before the great Tribunal: forgivene&s;s is the one way to have it taken off; and that is the thing we want. Try all other cour&s;es, and they will deceive you; but get a pardon, and your bu&s;ine&s;s is done; mi&s;s of that, and you are undone. There lies all the hope of a &s;inner. <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.9. <HI>To the Lord belong mercies and forgivene&s;&s;es.</HI> It is as much as your Lives, yea your Souls are worth, that you obtain it: be not then carele&s;s about this one thing, le&s;t you rue it for ever.</P>
<P N="5">5. Obtain forgivene&s;s, and you have all &s;ecured to you that is needful to make you happy for ever. Get this, and all will come with it: without it you can have nothing el&s;e. Chri&s;t will not be|&s;tow his Adoption, and his Grace, and his Glory upon an unpardoned &s;inner: but when he gives a pardon, he will give every thing el&s;e. Why then do men &s;it &s;till, &amp; neglect this great bu&s;ine&s;s? Can you find any thing el&s;e of equal moment? is there any other bu&s;ine&s;s comparably nece&s;&s;ary

to this? be not then carele&s;s about it, but &s;et your &s;elves to &s;eek it.</P>
<P>Directions how to do &s;o, will fall under a fol|lowing Doctrine; only be not &s;light about it; give your &s;elves no re&s;t, till you have gotten a par|don &s;igned and &s;ealed. Ble&s;s God who hath told you of it, and go to him for it in the Name of Chri&s;t, ask that faith of him by which you may receive it, and be made happy by it.</P>
<P><HI>USE. II.</HI> Let this put us all upon the <HI>Trial</HI> of our &s;tate, Whether we are indeed pardoned. And I know no que&s;tion more &s;olemn and weigh|ty, that any of us hath to put to our own Soul, than this, <HI>Am I a pardoned one? are my &s;ins forgiven? hath God blotted out my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions?</HI> And, except men be dead a&s;leep in a Lethargy of carnal &s;ecu|rity, one would think, they could not live at any re&s;t, till they had gotten a comfortable re&s;olution of this que&s;tion; till they had a &s;upporting hope, built upon a good foundation? Can we think of the Judgments of God to which we are expo&s;ed? Can we meditate on the day of Death which we are ha&s;tning unto, and know not how &s;oon it will over take us? Can we have any comfortable thoughts of the day of Judgment which is ha&s;tning, where all that are found out of Chri&s;t, and &s;o without a pardon, will be adjudged to everla&s;ting mi&s;eries, and yet not know how we are laid in for &s;uch a day? Let us then be &s;ollicitous about this matter, and be often bringing our &s;elves to the &s;tricte&s;t Rules of Trial which the word of God
<PB N="26" REF="000965_0025_0FADE6AE9189EDE0">
affords us, and of which we may &s;hortly have an account. Believe it, the re&s;olution of this ca&s;e of Con&s;cience, will make amends for all the pains that we can be at in &s;eeking after it.</P>
<P><HI>USE. III.</HI> Let it be for a word of <HI>Con&s;olation</HI> to all &s;uch as are pardoned.

Are you delivered from wrath to come, and can any thing el&s;e damp your joys is not here enough to ballance, yea to &s;wallow up all other &s;orrows what&s;oever?

<P N="1">1. In the Explication we may premi&s;e, That there is one Sin which, in the Go&s;pel, is exempt|ed from forgivene&s;s, and but one. It is true, all Sin impenitently per&s;i&s;ted in unto death, leaves the Sinner unpardoned; for there is neither Save|ing Repentance, nor forgivene&s;s to be obtained in another World, by one that dies in his Sins: but it is not becau&s;e former impenitency may not be pardoned upon Repentance, but becau&s;e the Sinner hath, by per&s;i&s;ting in it, lo&s;t the opportunity of a day of Grace. But there is one that in it &s;elf puts the man, in this life, out of all hope of par|don, and that is called <HI>The Sin against the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> of which our Saviour &s;o &s;peaks. <HI>Mark</HI> 3.28, 29. This is that which is called the <HI>Sin unto Death,</HI> which puts the man out of our Prayers&punc; 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.16. And this is that which is de&s;cribed to us. <HI>Heb.</HI> 6 4, 5. Nor indeed is this Sin unpar|donable, becau&s;e its Guilt out-bids the value of the Atonement, but becau&s;e by it, the man puts him|&s;elf out of the road of forgivene&s;s, according to the Divine Ordination, and by a malicious re|nouncing of the Go&s;pel, and the Spirit of God in it, after great illuminations, and an high pro|fe&s;&s;ion, he provokes God to give him over to hard|ne&s;s of heart, and &s;earedne&s;s of Con&s;cience, where|by he is Sealed to final impenitence, there being a total and final withdrawing of the Spirit from him. Concerning which, I &s;hall only &s;ay thus

much, that the per&s;on who is troubled and grieved in him&s;elf, for fear le&s;t he have commit|ted this Sin, hath therein a good evidence that he hath not, &s;ince the Go&s;pel &s;eems to give that as one in&s;eparable concomitant of it, <HI>viz.</HI> an ob|&s;tinate and a malicious hatred of the Go&s;pel way of Salvation. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">is &s;in only excepted, all o|ther &s;ins what&s;oever are pardonable: yea, and we have the in&s;tances of &s;uch, as have been guilty of them, and yet obtained forgivene&s;s: Let me a little open this in the following remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. The greate&s;t and vile&s;t &s;ins in them&s;elves may be forgiven. Our <HI>Catechi&s;m</HI> tells us, that <HI>&s;ome &s;ins are in them&s;elves more heinous than others</HI>; and the Scripture is full for it. Not but that all &s;ins are equally tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the Law, and con&s;equently incur the guilt of Eternal Death: yet if we con&s;ider and compare &s;ome with o|thers, there is in the things them&s;elves more of the malignity of the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">art di&s;covered in &s;ome than in others: God therefore tells the Prophet, that he will <HI>&s;hew him greater abominations,</HI> Ezek. 8.6, 13, 15. It is a &s;in to be angry without cau&s;e; but greater to commit actual Murder; a &s;in to murmur again&s;t God, but greater to bla&s;pheme; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now the greate&s;t and mo&s;t abominable of the&s;e are not out of the reach of a pardon: and we may well argue, that if Gods forgivene&s;s ex|tends to tho&s;e that are greater, it is not out bid by tho&s;e that are le&s;&s;er; there are <HI>&s;carlet</HI> and <HI>crim&s;on</HI> &s;ins, and yet the&s;e may be <HI>wa&s;hed</HI> away, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 1.18. I might here in&s;tance in tho&s;e that are

Idolatry</HI> is a fearful &s;in, and that which is terribly threatned in the Word of God; and yet God invites &s;uch to <HI>return</HI> upon the promi&s;e of <HI>pardon,</HI> Jer 3. <HI>begin. Bla&s;phemy</HI> is a &s;in of the fir&s;t rate, for men to rend and te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and reproach the Name of the Great God; and yet <HI>all manner of bla&s;phemies,</HI> the fore-cited one excepted, may be forgiven, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.31. <HI>Paul</HI>&punc; though a <HI>bla&s;phemer, obtained mercy,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.13. <HI>Witchcraft</HI> is an odious crime, for men to &s;ell them&s;elves to Satan, and practice his helli&s;h arts: God would not have &s;uch &s;uffered to live; and yet there is mercy for &s;uch too&punc; Such an one was <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> 2 Chron. 33.6. and what el&s;e were they? <HI>Acts</HI> 19.19. I might in&s;tance in more things, but the&s;e may &s;uffice?</P>
<P N="2">2. Sins committed with the greate&s;t and mo&s;t horrid aggravations, do not exclude men from pardon; that the &s;ame &s;ins in them&s;elves, are more or le&s;s heinous according to their circum|&s;tances, is evident by the Word of God, <HI>John</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="000965_0030_0FADE6B5584443D8">
15.22, 24. and the light of nature tells us that the more there is of <HI>pre&s;umption</HI> or <HI>ingratitude</HI>; that the more obligations are broken, the more is the Guilt that is contracted thereby; and by this occa&s;ion the &s;in that is lea&s;t in it &s;elf, may grow up into a formidable great one; and yet, when all the&s;e are added to encrea&s;e the Guilt, they will not make the &s;in amount to unpardonable; it may yet be forgiven; Here I might multiply; but I &s;hall only point to three or four more comprehen&s;ive ones.</P>
<P N="1">1. Though men have fallen into all manner of &s;ins, and tho&s;e the mo&s;t vile, yet there is forgivene&s;s. Some men have been noted for one, &s;ome for another; but when men <HI>Sell them&s;elves</HI> to all wickedne&s;s; Sins again&s;t the <HI>light of nature and con&s;cience,</HI> this renders them exceeding great. When every one brings guilt in&s;upportable along with it, what mu&s;t &s;o ma|ny do? when they have <HI>added iniquity to &s;in, as drunkenne&s;s to thir&s;t,</HI> this declares men to be beyond mea&s;ure vile, and fills up their indict|ment with a fearful company of Articles; and yet &s;uch a man ought not to de&s;pair of, but &s;eek to God in hope for a pardon; how ma|ny &s;ins of the fir&s;t magnitude are charged up|on <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI>? 2 Chron. 33. begin.

Though they have lived a long while in &s;uch &s;ins and multiplied them; they have not only fallen into them, but made a trade of them, and pur&s;ued them to old age; it hath been the cour&s;e they have followed from their youth up|ward; <HI>they have accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to it</HI>; there is a va&s;t difference between being overtaken with a Sin, and making it ones way and cour&s;e; and every repeated act of a &s;in, enflames the reckon|ing, and fills up the <HI>Ephah</HI>; vea, by this means men grow more and more hardned, and &s;o they grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e&punc; and yet when men have done their utmo&s;t on this account, God may, and &s;ometimes doth come and turn them to him&s;elf, and be&s;tow a compleat remi&s;&s;ion upon them: and for this al&s;o <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> is an amazing in&s;tance; hence Gods offer is not only to &s;uch as have <HI>played the harlot</HI> once, but many a time, and have made a trade of it, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3. begin.</P>
<P N="3">3. Though men have long with&s;tood the calls of the Go&s;pel, and &s;trivings of the Spirit with them, yet they may be forgiven.

<P N="2">2. I proceed now to give the ground or rea&s;ons of the Doctrine: and there are two a&s;&s;ertions that will be &s;erviceable for this pur|pose.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the vertue of Chri&s;t's Sacrifice is &s;ufficient for the forgivene&s;s of all &s;ins; and we may gather &s;ome intimation of what Gods purpo&s;e was, when we con&s;ider what provi&s;ion he hath made. However, here is rea&s;on &s;uffi|cient to evidence that all Sin may be pardoned when we are acquainted that there is enough in the remedy for it. Here ob&s;erve three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is no forgivene&s;s without &s;atis|faction made to the Ju&s;tice of God; the Law &s;tands out again&s;t every Sinner, and condemns him to dy: and that Law was the <HI>Rule of Re|lative Ju&s;tice</HI> between God and man, and can|not be baulked without violence offered to that Righteou&s;ne&s;s. It therefore is a&s;&s;erted, Heb. 9.22. <HI>Without blood there is no Remi&s;&s;ion,</HI> for, tho' God forgives the Sinner freely, in the applica|tion of it to the Subject, yet forgivene&s;s mu&s;t be fir&s;t laid in for him, and that by a &s;uffici|ent
<PB N="35" REF="000965_0034_0FADE6BB40FA2328">
price paid for him, or el&s;e there were no room for &s;uch an Application, as the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e &s;tands between God and man in the <HI>Fir&s;t Co|venant</HI>; &s;o that if there could have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no &s;atisfaction made, there could not have any forgivene&s;s been conferred, but the Law mu&s;t have unavoidably pa&s;t into execution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pon the guilty Creature.</P>
<P N="2">2. That God hath accepted of his Son to make his &s;atisfaction. Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath under|taken i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and his Father is well plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed with it. The Sinner him&s;elf was fir&s;tly re&s;pon&s;ible for it, and God might have made his demands of him, and no other; but it hath plea&s;ed him to look to his Son for it. This was in|dented for in the <HI>Covenant of Surety&s;hip</HI>; the Father offered it, and the Son complied with it, and there were Articles concluded about it, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 53.10. God <HI>Sent his Son</HI> about it, and he came accordingly, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.4, 5. his bu&s;ine&s;s was <HI>to take away his peoples &s;ins,</HI> Joh. 1.29. and one thing that belonged to this, was the taking a|way their Guilt by forgivene&s;s: and when he was engaged in this affair, his Father witne&s;&s;ed to his acceptance of him in it, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.17.</P>
<P N="3">3. That in Chri&s;t's &s;atisfaction, there is a &s;ufficiency to expiate the Guilt of all &s;in. Such was the vertue of this <HI>One Sacrifice,</HI> which he offered up to the Ju&s;tice of God, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.14. hence is he &s;aid to be <HI>able to &s;ave to the utter|most, Heb.</HI> 7.25. It was not only enough for &s;maller tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, but for the <HI>Chief Sins and Sin|ners,</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="000965_0035_0FADE6BC4B6488D0">
1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15. and this will be very evident, if we con&s;ider what he did for the expiation of the Guilt of our Sins; and that was, he &s;uffered for them, the whole puni&s;hment that was by Law due to us for them; it is full<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> expre&s;t, in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 53, 4, 5, 6. he underwent the whole weight of the Wrath which we &s;hould have undergone; <HI>he was made &s;in for us,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.21. and then let us add to con&s;ider, that he was the Son of God, a <HI>Divine Per&s;on,</HI> that &s;uffered all this; though it was his <HI>Humane Nature</HI> that bare it, yet the per&s;on that &s;u&s;tained it was God, and therefore it is cal|led <HI>his blood,</HI> Acts 20.28. and this put an infinite value and vertue into his Obedience: So that there is a &s;tock of pardon laid in, that cannot be exhau&s;ted: all the &s;in of all the Sinners in the World, cannot exhau&s;t it.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Go&s;pel de&s;ign is mo&s;t of all ad|vanced, by his forgiving of all Sin; and this is rea&s;on &s;ufficient why he not only can, but will do it. Here ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Go&s;pel great de&s;ign is the illu&s;trati|on of the <HI>&s;pecial Grace</HI> of God. By Gods &s;pecial Grace, I intend that which is to be &s;hewn in the Salvation of fallen man; there is common grace expre&s;t in many other things, but this is that which God hath a peculiar de&s;ign of commen|ding to the undone creature; and this is that which is di&s;covered in the Go&s;pel; the great contrivances in Gods Eternal Decree, with re|&s;pect to his Elect, had an aim at this, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.6. and tho&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing Providences which were
<PB N="37" REF="000965_0036_0FADE6BCE1091B88">
concerned in our fall by the Fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> and be|ing repaired again by the Second, were <HI>media</HI> &s;ubordinated to this purpo&s;e; all was to make way for the Grace of God to appear in its mo&s;t &s;plendent lu&s;tre: So that our whole Salvation is a&s;cribed to this <HI>grace,</HI> Eph. 2.8.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the forgivene&s;s of Sins is an expre&s;&s;ion of rich Grace. The not doing of it without the &s;atisfaction of Chri&s;t, is no ob&s;truction of the Grace of it, as &s;ome fondly dream, but doth the more enhance it. What is Grace, but an act of free favour be&s;towed on the Subject, which he no way de&s;erved, nor could have laid any claim unto, had it not been &s;o conferred? and &s;uch is this forgivene&s;s: hence &s;aid to be done <HI>freely,</HI> Rom. 3.24. The pardoned Sinner de&s;erved to dy; all mi&s;eries belonged to him; he had no|thing to offer to atone God to him&s;elf withal; Chri&s;t freely &s;atisfied for him, and God freely applies the merit of this to him: and it mu&s;t needs be rich Grace, for we have already ob&s;erv|ed, that the man is made a ble&s;&s;ed one by it.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the more and greater &s;ins it extends unto, the more illu&s;trious is the Grace of it. There is &s;o much of malignity in the lea&s;t &s;in, and &s;o ju&s;t a provocation given to God by it, and the merit of death in it is &s;o righteous, that it is a wonder that God &s;hould forgive one Sin: how then is this admiration ju&s;tly encrea&s;ed, when the Sins of the Creature, have ri&s;en to a mo&s;t formidable multitude and magnitude? <HI>Paul</HI> puts a great Empha&s;is on this, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.13, 14.
<PB N="38" REF="000965_0037_0FADE6BD9320CA20">
<HI>Who was a bla&s;phemer, a Per&s;ecutor, injurious,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and the Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant,</HI> &amp;c. What is the forgiving of an <HI>Hundred pence,</HI> to <HI>ten Thou&s;and Talents? Paul</HI> tells us that he was by this <HI>made a pattern, ver&s;e</HI> 16. and <HI>David</HI> makes this an argument to plead for pardon withal, P&s;al. 25.11. <HI>Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great</HI>; we are therefore told, that <HI>where Sin abounded, grace much more abounded, Rom.</HI> 5 20. hereby the great love of God is manife&s;ted, and the incom|putable value of Chri&s;t's Obedience is di&s;covered.</P>
<P N="4">4 Hence the exhibition and offer of this par|don is made to the greate&s;t Sinners; the Go&s;pel invites all without exception, what&s;oever they have been or done.

<P><HI>USE I.</HI> For Caution: Be we advi&s;ed to be|ware of abu&s;ing this precious Doctrine, by en|couraging

our &s;elves to live and ly in Sin. Such is the ba&s;ene&s;s in the heart of &s;inful men, and &s;o ready is Satan to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into it, that they are exceeding apt to take encourage|ment to Sin, from that which &s;hould be the mo&s;t heart breaking incentive of them to ha|tred again&s;t it.

<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. God will forgive none but in a way con|&s;i&s;tent with his <HI>Holine&s;s.</HI> Remember, that as there is a pardon to be had with God, for all &s;in, &s;o there is a way in which it is to be ob|tained,

and out of the way it is vain to expect it: and God will not advance one <HI>Attribute</HI> to the wrong or injury of another.

<P N="3">3. Hence, if you live and dy in your &s;ins, this forgivene&s;s will be none of yours.

Remember, this Grace now waits upon you; but when once time ends with you, you &s;hall hear of it no more; and if you dy under the dominion of &s;in, you will cer|tainly dy under the guilt of it: and there is no readier way to provoke God to cut you off with a <HI>&s;wift de&s;truction,</HI> than thus to offer indignity to the proclamation of pardon, that he hath made unto you.</P>

nothing for him, but a fearful expectation of the fiery indignation of God</HI>; there is none that knows what a &s;inner he hath been, el&s;e they would give him no encouragement. To any that are in &s;uch a condition, let me, from this Doctrine, offer the&s;e things to your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. You have not out &s;inned the vertue of Chri&s;t's Satisfaction. If you had arrived at that, you might well de&s;pair and dy; but as long as there is vertue enough in that for your pardon, there is hope, and you &s;hould improve it; your &s;ins have been horribly great, but Chri&s;t's merits are &s;till greater. It would be a reproach to the value of Chri&s;t's oblation, if that could not buy off the greate&s;t Sinner from Condemnation. If you could run on the &s;core with revenging Ju&s;tice, beyond his ability to make payment, how &s;hould he be one <HI>able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t?</HI> Remember, Chri&s;t paid an infinite price, and that which is &s;o, cannot be out done.</P>
<P N="2">2. You have not &s;o &s;inned, but that God can magnify his mercy in forgiving you. It will be no reproach to his <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> becau&s;e Chri&s;t hath done enough to an&s;wer that; and it will be a wonderful manife&s;tation of his <HI>Grace:</HI> God will be <HI>for ever admired</HI> in your pardon and &s;alvation; the more and more aggravated &s;ins are forgiven you, the more will his <HI>kindne&s;s</HI> appear to you, and the more prai&s;es will be to his name for e|ver: and your <HI>love</HI> will be the more enlarged to him, becau&s;e he hath <HI>forgiven you much,</HI> Luk. 7.47. and God highly prizeth the <HI>Attribute</HI> of his <HI>Grace.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="43" REF="000965_0042_0FADE6C2DEE0A1F0">3. You have not out-&s;inned the examples of his pardoning mercy. It is an encouragement to think, that what&s;oever you have to &s;ay again&s;t your &s;elves, in this re&s;pect, you may find a paralel in&s;tance for it in the word of God, of &s;uch who were <HI>in the &s;ame Condemnation,</HI> and yet are forgiven, as hath already been pointed at in the Explication. And what God hath done, he can do, for <HI>His Arm is not &s;hortned</HI>; and it is to be hoped he will do, for he is as gracious now as ever.</P>
<P N="4">4. You have not out-&s;inned the Go&s;pel call. It is Gods rich forbearance that you have not, but through mercy you have not. Why then do you &s;tand drooping and de&s;ponding! be of good cheer, he calls you; he &s;ends to you, he makes you the offers of his Salvation; the proclamation of pardon is not out, there is room for you to come in and have it; you grieve him that you &s;u&s;pect his willingne&s;s, you cannot better plea&s;e him, than to adventure and ca&s;t your &s;elves upon his mercy.</P>
<P><HI>USE. III.</HI> Let this then be glad tidings to great Sinners, and put you upon going to God for this forgivene&s;s. Is it to be had with him? why then do you not &s;eek it of him? Are there no grievous Sinners among us? yea, ought not every one that lives impenitent under the means of Grace, to account him&s;elf &s;o? And are there none that have exceeded in notorious Crimes? and are you no whit taken with this good news? why then do you &s;it &s;till, and not make out after it? Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="44" REF="000965_0043_0FADE6C3A1380740">1. If your Sin be not forgiven you, you are un|done. <HI>Guilt,</HI> not removed&punc; will drag you down to the bottomle&s;s pit: <HI>The weight of one Sin un|pardoned is enough to &s;ink you for ever.</HI> If God had not found out a way to pardon Sin, all the race of mankind had been in a de&s;perate condition. If you appear before Chri&s;t, in the great day, in your Sins, you will not be able to &s;tand in the Judgment.</P>
<P N="2">2. The more and greater your Sins have been, the more fearful will be your Condemnation. Great Sinners have mo&s;t of all need to fly to God for a pardon; for the puni&s;hment of &s;uch is like to be far <HI>more Intolerable</HI> than that of others. You &s;hould therefore look upon the aggravations of your Sins, to be the more Potent incentives to drive you to God, for forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. If you do not make ha&s;t, it will quickly be too late. It mu&s;t be done while God &s;its on a throne of Grace, or el&s;e it cannot be done at all: when he hath &s;at out his patience, and given out the <HI>Oath,</HI> there is then no pardon to be had. And great Sinners have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to be afraid, le&s;t the day &s;hould be done &s;peedily: for of all Sinners, &s;uch have lea&s;t hope to e&s;cape; and &s;uch Sins give &s;pecial provocation to an Holy God to <HI>make a &s;peedy work</HI> with them.

<HEAD>Pardon removes the load of Sin from the Sinner. DOCTRINE. III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GOD, in pardoning of Sin, removes the load of it from the Sinner.</HI> There are three words u&s;ed in our <HI>Text,</HI> by which this forgivene&s;s is expre&s;&s;ed, which do &s;et it out emphatically; the opening whereof will help to di&s;cover the excellency of this benefit. We ob&s;erved that the word tran&s;lated <HI>forgiven,</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>to take a thing off,</HI> and is a metaphor from an heavy load that oppre&s;&s;eth one: Such is &s;in here &s;uppo&s;ed to be, and pardon to give the man ea&s;e, by taking it off from him.</P>
<P>There are two Propo&s;itions here to be taken notice of, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That the Guilt of Sin is an exceeding heavy burden.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Forgivene&s;s removes this burden from the Sinner&punc;</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="47" REF="000965_0046_0FADE6C8B5F2FD48">1. That the Guilt of Sin is an exceeding heavy burden</P>
<P>Sin, as light as the mo&s;t of men make of it, is an oppre&s;&s;ing, and intollerable load, and it is Guilt that makes it &s;o; the truth of this conclu&s;ion will appear from the con&s;ideration of three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. From the nature of Guilt it &s;elf; and in|deed there need no more but this to clear the truth in hand.</P>
<P>In the Demon&s;tration of this, I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t largely; <HI>Guilt is properly an obligation lying upon a Sinner to &s;uffer puni&s;hment</HI>: and it falls upon him as &s;oon as he hath by Sin made him&s;elf obnoxious. It properly ari&s;eth from the relation which he bears to the Law of God. All mankind origi|nally are the Subjects of the Law, and by the <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion</HI> of it they are denominated <HI>Sinners,</HI> 1 Joh. 3.4. Now there is in the Law a threat|ning of puni&s;hment denounced again&s;t the man, in ca&s;e of his &s;inning; and by vertue of this threatning, as &s;oon as the man is chargeable with Sin, he is under that Sentence by which the pu|ni&s;hment becomes due to him, and is judicially laid upon him; and it is truly and properly the Guilt under con&s;ideration. <HI>We are to di&s;tingui&s;h between the Sentence of the Law, and of the Judge</HI>; the former renders the man Guilty in his &s;tate, the latter doth but declare him to be &s;o, and ac|cordingly adjudge him to puni&s;hment; the Ver|dict of the Jury doth not make the man guil|ty, but finds him &s;o; and if he were not &s;o
<PB N="48" REF="000965_0047_0FADE6C9DEF5E358">
before, it is a fal&s;e Verdict. Now this mu&s;t needs be an heavy weight; and will appear &s;o, if we con&s;ider, that the whole puni&s;hment that is due to, and de&s;erved by &s;in, is hereby laid upon the Sinner, and he is <HI>held fast</HI> to the &s;uffering of it: and he that &s;hall read all the Cur&s;es of the Law, and the fearful things that are therein threatned mu&s;t needs &s;ay that they are unconceivably heavy, and enough to make the &s;toute&s;t Sinner to &s;ink under them; the&s;e, when they &s;hall come to be born, will be found un&s;upportable: and it mu&s;t needs be very oppre&s;&s;ive to have them charged upon the man &s;o as Guilt doth; &s;o a man to read over all the Cur&s;es of the bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of God, and have his Con&s;cience to tell him, <HI>this is thy portion,</HI> thou art the man again&s;t whom this doom is out, and mu&s;t expect every moment when it will fall upon thee, is extreamly oppre&s;&s;ive: and yet this is the nature of Guilt; but this will be farther illu&s;trated in the next thing.</P>
<P N="2">2. From the bitter groans and complaints of tho&s;e who have been under the apprehen&s;ion of the guilt of Sin. How have they cried out as oppre&s;&s;ed, and &s;inking under their burden, when nothing el&s;e hath ailed them, but only God hath awakned them, and charged their &s;ins heavy upon their Con&s;ciences, with the di&s;covery of his ter|rors, or that Wrath which was out again&s;t them for their &s;in? this may be exemplified in three re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="49" REF="000965_0048_0FADE6CA56F31388">1. The re&s;entment that impenitent Sinners have had of this Guilt, when awakned. God hath left us &s;ome in&s;tances of it, and te&s;timonies about it in his word for our admonition. How was it with <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in</HI> when his doom was pa&s;t upon him? <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.13. and whence aro&s;e that de&s;pair|ing conclu&s;ion of his, but from the weight of his Guilt? and how was it with <HI>Judas</HI> upon this ac|count? <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. <HI>begin.</HI> out of doubt it was the intollerablene&s;s of the oppre&s;&s;ion of his Guilt that drave him to hang him&s;elf; and whence are the&s;e fearful expo&s;tulations of Sinners? I&s;a. 33.14 <HI>Who among us &s;hall dwell,</HI> &amp;c. and in how many doth God in&s;tance this truth, that <HI>a Con&s;cience throughly wounded with Guilt, is a thing that cannot be born,</HI> but &s;inks the man under it, more than if he had a mountain lying upon him, according to Prov. 18.14. <HI>A wounded &s;pirit who can bear</HI>?</P>
<P N="2">2. The pre&s;&s;ure that men have been under by rea&s;on of one &s;in laid upon them. God &s;ome|times, by Con&s;cience, chargeth one particular &s;in upon a man, and when he doth it home, it is too much for him, e&s;pecially when it is &s;ome great and horrid &s;in; or if the Con&s;cience doth &s;o re|&s;ent it; and we find not that <HI>Cain</HI> was in di&s;tre&s;s on account of any other &s;in but his <HI>Murder,</HI> or <HI>Judas</HI> for any thing be&s;ides his <HI>betraying his inno|cent Ma&s;ter</HI>; and yet how <HI>Tragical</HI> was it to them? what then mu&s;t it be to be under the load of innumerable Sins? to have the fir&s;t great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion charged on them, and that O|riginal Sin which hath all abominations in it, and
<PB N="50" REF="000965_0049_0FADE6CB17CD8D38">
a life full of uncountable and aggravated actual prevarications: certainly every one mu&s;t add its proportionable weight.</P>
<P N="3">3. The di&s;tre&s;s that hath been upon Gods own Children, when they have been under the dread of <HI>Guilt.</HI> I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of this in the following ver&s;es; a touch may here &s;uf|fice. It is certain, that Guilt, in the proper leg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> notion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is removed from all Gods Children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in what &s;en&s;e they may be &s;aid to be guilty, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> matter of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er enquiry; but this is certain, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they many times have a &s;ad apprehen&s;ion of <HI>Guil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> upon them, and it is a &s;inking thing to them, and they cannot tell how to &s;tand under it: they cry out of it terribly, <HI>it is a burden too heavy, and makes them to roar, P&s;al.</HI> 38.4, 6, 8. and how had <HI>David</HI> his <HI>bones broken</HI> by this weight falling upon them? <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.8. yea, how doth it make him to cry out to <HI>be delivered from this Guilt, ver&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 14. and what was it but our. Guilt charged o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Lord Chri&s;t, that made him in &s;uch a bloo|dy agony?</P>
<P N="3">3 From the efficacy of it, if it be not remov|ed; if this Guilt abide upon the Sinner, and be not taken off from him, it will unavoidably &s;ink him down into the depth of mi&s;eries; and all the &s;trength of the whole Creation is not able to &s;upport him again&s;t it. It is <HI>Guilt</HI> that brings Sinners to <HI>Everla&s;ting Burnings</HI>; and all their <HI>refuges of lies</HI> will not &s;ave them there|from. It is <HI>Guilt</HI> that makes men that they can|not <HI>&s;tand in the Judgment, P&s;al.</HI> 1.5. and this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="51" REF="000965_0050_0FADE6CBE01F28E8">
from the weight of it. This is the <HI>Talent of lead</HI> that will &s;ink them into Eternal Perdition: Needs then mu&s;t it be beyond mea&s;ure heavy.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>If any &s;hould here demur and &s;ay, how can this be? who are more ea&s;y and jocund than Guilty Sinners? do we not dayly &s;ee the vile&s;t of men the mo&s;t unconcerned; they look as if nothing oppre&s;&s;ed them, but live carele&s;s and confident: and how could they do &s;o, if &s;uch a burden were on them?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There may be a fair account given of this; for,</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a <HI>Spiritual Death,</HI> under which na|tural men are; and lay never &s;o much weight upon one that is dead, he feels it not. <HI>Carnal Se|curity</HI> is one thing belonging to this death, which renders men &s;tupid and regardle&s;s: and it is a <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> upon Sinners, keeping them under <HI>Guilt,</HI> which if they did feel the burden of, they would &s;eek after relief; and therefore it is many times judicially encrea&s;ed, as <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 6.9, 10.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a fal&s;e ea&s;e which many have got|ten, that takes off the &s;en&s;e of this burden. They think they have gotten it removed, and that plea&s;eth them. Some are per&s;waded by Satan to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ink there is no danger, God will not pu|ni&s;h them for their Sins; and &s;o their Guilt troubleth them not; to &s;uch God &s;peaks, in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 24.4. <HI>Fury is not in me: q. d.</HI> You think I will not puni&s;h you. Some think them&s;elves well &s;heltered under their <HI>refuges of lies,</HI> I&s;a. 28.14.
<PB N="52" REF="000965_0051_0FADE6CEAF35E448">
Others plea&s;e them&s;elves with &s;ome legal work that hath pa&s;t upon them, thinking that they have gotten a pardon, and that quiets them: or they re&s;t upon their outward priviledges, Crying <HI>The Temple of the Lord,</HI> which for the pre&s;ent keeps them from re&s;enting their burden.</P>
<P N="3">3. We do not know always how it is within with the&s;e that carry a &s;hew of mirth and quiet|ne&s;s. The wi&s;e man tells us, <HI>Prov.</HI> 14.13. <HI>Even in laughter&punc; the heart is &s;orrowful.</HI> And certainly there are many that put on a bold face, and hide their troubles, who yet have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful girdings in their Con&s;ciences, and carry a terrible load on them, which they know not how to &s;tand under, but it pincheth them intolerably. Hence we have that awful remark, <HI>Job</HI> 15.20, 21. <HI>The wicked man travelleth with pain all his dayes, &amp;c.</HI> And ever and anon they cannot hide i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with all their endea|vours but it will make &s;ome di&s;coveries.</P>
<P N="4">4. That God will &s;ooner or later make every Sinner to feel this burden. The few in&s;tances we have of this, tell us what is their Condition; and God, will, either in this life, or a death, or after it, lay it on &s;o as they &s;hall feel it terrible. There is never a Sinner Converted to God, but hath had of this experience, this was it that made him fly to Chri&s;t, this put him into dread, made him go about under horrours, till he gat a pardon. Stand by the bed &s;ide of &s;ome dying Sinners, and you &s;hall hear tho&s;e bitter complaints, that will con|firm the truth in hand&punc; and the re&s;t is known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o them that are gone to the place of Torments.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="53" REF="000965_0052_0FADE6CFDD34F978">2. That forgivene&s;s removes his burden from the Sinner: it takes off this heavy weight from him; this is the proper and genuine effect of pardon of Sin. This will be evident in the Con|&s;ideration of the&s;e things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The wrath of God lying upon Sinners is that which is the great burden of Sin. It is true, Sin it &s;elf is a vile, odious, filthy thing, and that which no gracious Soul can endure, but de&s;ires to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of, and delivered from: but the di&s;tre&s;s that is in it, is that the Great God is offended by it, and that he is angry at the Sinner: hence the great Complaints of Gods Children them&s;elves, is a|bout the <HI>Lying of wrath heavy upon them, P&s;al.</HI> 88.7, 16.89 46.90.7, 9, 11. To have that God, who&s;e <HI>Voice makes the hills to quake, and mountains to tremble</HI>: that God, who&s;e fury when it burns is a fire unquenchable, to be angry at us; this is that which we cannot bear: all the rage of men and devils is nothing in compari&s;on with that. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 22.14. <HI>Can thine heart endure?

<P N="2">2. That which lays this burden on the Sinner is his Guilt. But for that he would not be con|cerned in it.

arrows, then they have put them&s;elves in the way of it, and woe to them; and none but Guilty Sinners &s;o do. The holy Angels have no burden by it, it never toucheth or comes near them: they that are reconciled to God in and through Chri&s;t, by the application of his Blood to them, cannot be hurt by it: No, it is the Sentence, which tells the Sinner, from the Mouth of an Holy, and True God, <HI>Thou mu&s;t dy</HI>; this, this is the burden: and what is it that receives this, but a Con&s;cience convicted of Guilt?</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence as long as this Guilt abides, he mu&s;t needs be under that load. This is it that chains him down to it, which <HI>Concludes him under it</HI>: let him be otherwi&s;e circum&s;tanced to his hearts de&s;ire, yet all avails not; Guilt maintains the Cur&s;e again&s;t him; Guilt for all pronounceth him a man of Death; whiles he is under Guilt the Law is his enemy, it thundereth our its threatnings again&s;t him, and he is every moment expo&s;ed to feel the dint of the Cur&s;e&punc; <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 7.11.

And hence <HI>there is no Peace</HI> to be hoped for in this Condition. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 57. <HI>ult.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. God, in pardoning the Sinner takes off this Guilt from him: This is the great benefit that comes in to him by it. And here ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">1. That pardon bears a proper re&s;pect to <HI>Guilt.</HI> There are &s;everal Con&s;iderations under which Sin cometh, but of them all, that which a pardon is

concerned about and extends to, is <HI>Guilt.</HI> It doth nothing to the taking away the being of Sin, to the removing of the defilement of it; that belongs to <HI>Sanctification</HI>; but it is conver&s;ant about the <HI>Guilt.</HI> Pardon is the act of the <HI>Judge,</HI> and it re|&s;pects the <HI>Crime,</HI> as it expo&s;eth the Sinner to pun|i&s;hment, and that ari&s;eth from his <HI>Guilt.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Hence, in it, the Sentence of the Law Con|demning him is removed: This is the very thing it doth: The penalty of the Law was <HI>Death,</HI> and he, by being expo&s;ed to it; was <HI>a man of Death</HI>; but a pardon brings with it a revoking of that Sen|tence. God, when he pardons the Sinner, &s;aith that <HI>he &s;hall not Dy but Live</HI>; the Cur&s;e of the Law &s;hall not take place upon him, but he &s;hall be de|livered from it. It is excellently expre&s;&s;ed. <HI>Job</HI> 33 24. <HI>Deliver him from going down to the pit.</HI> Hence that conclu&s;ion, <HI>Rom.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.1. <HI>There is now no more Condemnation:</HI> the Sin remains; for that which hath once been done, cannot be undone: the merit abides; it will be for ever true, That <HI>the man hath done things worthy of Death:</HI> but the Sentence it &s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is revoked. How this is done, con&s;i&s;tent with the Ju&s;tice of God, will be enquired in a following Doctrine: but &s;o it is; a pardoned man is out of the reach of the Law in its Cur&s;es: <HI>He is for ever delivered from his Judge.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Hereupon, in the account of the Law, his Sins are as if they had never been. When Guilt is tran&s;lated by a pardon, the Law hath no more to charge the man with, than if he had never com|mitted any Sin at all. It is true, he hath rea&s;on
<PB N="56" REF="000965_0055_0FADE6D1D11AF3B8">
<HI>to remember his faults,</HI> and to be humbled for them, but the Law hath di&s;charged him: and this is part of the meaning of that, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.14. <HI>Sin &s;hall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the Law: Sin doth not reign to death</HI> in &s;uch an one: the pardoned Sinner <HI>is made the Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of God, in Chri&s;t,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21. and this is the meaning of that &s;trange expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Numb.</HI> 23.21. <HI>He hath &s;een no iniquity in Jacob, nor perver&s;e|ne&s;s in I&s;rael</HI>; it cannot be intended of his <HI>Omni&s;ci|ence,</HI> for, if there be any &s;ins committed by his people, as cetainly there are, he mu&s;t needs &s;o &s;ee and know them. Nor can it be intended o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his dealing with them in the <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> of the New-Covenant, for &s;o he both &s;eeth and is di&s;|plea&s;ed at the bold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of his Children, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 11. <HI>ult.

<P N="4">4. This makes way for the ea&s;ing Con&s;cience of its load. It is true, as there are &s;ome who&s;e Sins ly upon them, and they are in&s;en&s;ible of it, as was before ob&s;erved; &s;o there are &s;ome who&s;e Sins are taken off by this forgivene&s;s, and yet the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> feel burden by them, becau&s;e they have not the clear apprehen&s;ion of a Pardon, &s;ealed in their Con&s;ciences.

<P N="2">2. This is a fearful burden, whether you ap|prehend it to be &s;o or no, it is &s;o in it &s;elf, and will be &s;ooner or later experienced &s;o to be by you.

<P N="3">3. If therefore this Guilt abide on you, it will &s;ink you into perdition.

<P N="1">1. <HI>What is implied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Covering of Sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This phra&s;e is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;ed to expre&s;s the For|givene&s;s of Sin, and is accordingly to be interpre|ted. Now the rea&s;on why things are Covered, is that they may be hidden out of &s;ight; that they may not always be in our eye and view to be looked on; and the end of our Covering a thing is either with re&s;pect to our &s;elves or others. In regard to others, we Cover it, that they may not &s;ee or know it, thus, 1 Pet. 4.8. <HI>Charity &s;hall cover the multitude of &s;ins; i. e.</HI> it keeps them to it &s;elf, and doth not divulge them. <HI>Covering</HI> is oppo&s;ed to <HI>di&s;covering</HI>; thus when men bring pretences to put off things, they are &s;aid to cover them: excu|&s;es are called Covers. With re&s;pect to our &s;elves we are &s;aid to cover a thing, when we <HI>put it out of our &s;ight, in order to the putting it out of our remem|brance</HI>: and we are wont to do &s;o by things, the &s;ight and memory whereof would be a grief or a vexation to us; and thus are we here to under|&s;tand it. God covers his peoples &s;ins from his own &s;ight, that <HI>&s;o he may not remember them,</HI> nor be angry at his Children by rea&s;on of them, &s;o as to take vengeance on them upon the account thereof, the Scripture repre&s;ents Sin as a thing
<PB N="67" REF="000965_0066_0FADE6DC50F3D800">
<HI>odious</HI> to God, a thing that he <HI>cannot endure</HI> to look upon, <HI>Hab.</HI> 1.13. a thing that horribly pro|vokes him again&s;t the Sinner; and therefore cal|led <HI>the abominable thing that he hates,</HI> Jer. 44.4. Hence, when he is re&s;olved to puni&s;h men for it, he is &s;aid, to <HI>&s;et it in his &s;ight,</HI> P&s;al. 90.8 <HI>to make &s;trict &s;earch after it,</HI> Zech. 1.12. <HI>To call it to remembrance, Ezek.</HI> 21.23.

All of which expre&s;&s;ions are of the &s;ame import with this of Covering them.</P>
<P>If it be here enquired, how can God be &s;aid to cover our Sin out of his &s;ight? It mu&s;t be re|plied, that it is &s;poken after the manner of men, who are wont to forget, or take no notice of that which is laid out of the way. And here let us ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">1. That nothing can be covered to God in re|&s;pect of his <HI>Omni&s;cience.</HI> Heb. 4.13. There is no &s;uch veil of darkne&s;s can be ca&s;t over any thing that can intercept his &s;ight, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 139.11, 12. Gods Infinite Omnipre&s;ence nece&s;&s;arily infers that every thing mu&s;t be in his eye, and it is im|po&s;&s;ible to ab&s;cond it from him, &s;o as he &s;hall not know it thoroughly; and equally impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould forget it; we are on this account of|ten warned to be cautious, becau&s;e we are ever
<PB N="68" REF="000965_0067_0FADE6DED5273CC8">
under the in&s;pection of his all &s;eeing eye.</P>
<P N="2">2. That God doth not &s;o put their Sins out of his &s;ight, but that he puts them in mind of them, and &s;ometimes makes them &s;mart for them; thus we have <HI>Job</HI> awfully complaining, <HI>Job</HI> 13.26. What a &s;olemn memorial did he cau&s;e the Pro|phet to mention to <HI>David</HI>? 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.7, 8. and how much and how long did he make him to &s;mart on this account afterwards? yea doutle&s;s all the Afflictions that are brought on the Children of God in way of Correction for their Sins, are witne&s;&s;es that he hath an eye upon them, or a re|membrance of them in a di&s;ciplinary way; Hence,</P>
<P N="3">3. This covering them properly re&s;pects <HI>Vin|dictive Ju&s;tice,</HI> or the Sentence of the Law which is out again&s;t them; and that is the Guilt that cleaves to them, and it is a pardon that doth it&punc; For,</P>
<P N="1">1. When God pardons Sin, he removes the Guilt of it from the Sinner; the obligation that lay on him, binding him over to dy, cea&s;eth: this hath been already made evident.</P>
<P N="2">2. In removing this Guilt, God turns away his <HI>Vindictive eye</HI> from it: though the Sin remains, and the merit too, yet God will no longer look on him as a Guilty Sinner; he will not <HI>&s;ee iniqui|ty in him</HI>; the man de&s;erves that he &s;hould; but God is re&s;olved that he will overlook it, as a thing out of &s;ight; he hath nothing to lay to the man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> charge, nor will he hear of any <HI>Charge</HI> laid again&s;t him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.33. and this is aptly expre&s;t by his
<PB N="69" REF="000965_0068_0FADE6E0065191A8">
covering it, for <HI>if he &s;hould mark, who could &s;tand</HI>? P&s;al. 130.3.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hereupon the Guilt comes to be utterly lo&s;t; it is a &s;trange expre&s;&s;ion, Jer. 50 20. <HI>The I|niquity of I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;ought for&punc; and there &s;hall be none, and the Sins of Judab, and they &s;hall not be found</HI>; alas! if &s;earch be made, there is enough to be found, that hath been &s;inful and provoking; but it refers to puni&s;hment, which pre&s;umeth Guilt, and &s;o there &s;hall be none found. When they are put on trial for their lives, and enquiry is made, What Sins are to be charged on &s;uch? the an&s;wer is, there are none to be found, they &s;tand condemned for none: and why? <HI>for they are cast into the Sea</HI>; they are all <HI>blotted out</HI> of the book of accounts; the Indictment again&s;t them is defaced; they are covered as a thing that is buried out of &s;ight, as one that is dead and for|gotten; they are <HI>blotted out as a Cloud,</HI> I&s;a. 44 22. and one well ob&s;erves, that a Cloud is it &s;elf a blot in the face of the Sky, and is therefore blotted out by making it to vani&s;h and di&s;ap|pear: and &s;o doth God by his peoples &s;ins: and this is the covering of them.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Who is it that Covers it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is God, and he only, who can thus Cover Sin. If Covering be forgiving, then it belongs to him alone who can forgive, and that is <HI>Gods Pre|rogative, Dan.</HI> 9.9. If it be the Guilt of Sin that is covered, and &s;o covered that it &s;hall never ri&s;e a|gain, or be charged, it mu&s;t needs be a Divine Work. <HI>Sin is a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of Gods Law,</HI> and the
<PB N="70" REF="000965_0069_0FADE6E111A1AFE8">
Guilt contracted by it is an Obligation to &s;uffer accordingly; and who &s;hall remove it but he? Men may forgive the wrong that is done to them, &s;o far as they are concerned, but they cannot forgive the Violation of the Command of God that is therein perpetrated. Men may indeed Charitatively, or Mini&s;terially declare this forgive|ne&s;s, but they cannot be&s;tow it. It is one of the Letters of Gods Name, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34.7. <HI>Forgiving ini|quity, Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and Sin.</HI> We may indeed cover the Sins of our Neighbour, by keeping them Secret, and not divulging them, but that doth not hide them from the Revenging Ju&s;tice of God, who will for all in due time make a di&s;covery of them, if they be not forgiven by him. And we may cover our own Sins, by denying them, di&s;|&s;embling, excu&s;ing, extenuating, ju&s;tifying them: but this will but aggravate the Guilt of them, and expo&s;e us to the more &s;evere puni&s;hment, <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.13 This covering of Sin belongs to Ju&s;tification; &amp; it is <HI>God alone that Ju&s;tifyeth, Rom.</HI> 8.33. And in|deed God, and no other, hath that cover to throw over the Sins of his people, that can hide them from his revenging eye: Every other cover is but <HI>an hiding place of deceit.</HI> God therefore challengeth it to him&s;elf as his prerogative, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 43.25. <HI>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</HI> If all the power and authority in the World, Civil and Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical, &s;hould Sub&s;cribe and Seal an act of Obli|vion for us, it will &s;ignify nothing; no, though the Angels of Heaven &s;hould joyn in it. <HI>God is Judge of the World,</HI> and he can either ratify or
<PB N="71" REF="000965_0070_0FADE6E1955BFCB0">
nullify all that is done; his act alone can make it authentick. Hence, though we are to ask forgive|ne&s;s one of another, yet we are not to re&s;t in that, but if we would have our Sins buried, and not digged up again, we mu&s;t go to him to do it for us.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>How, or after what manner it is Covered?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We are here to con&s;ider God as a <HI>Righteous Judge,</HI> and therefore to do nothing but what is con&s;i&s;tent with that Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his. We read, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.26. <HI>He is both ju&s;t, and ju&s;tifyeth.</HI> Now it is one piece of Gods Righteou&s;ne&s;s as a Judge, to puni&s;h the Sinner according to Law; and Guilt binds him over to puni&s;hment: how then doth he continue ju&s;t, and yet cover this Guilt &s;o as it &s;hall not ri&s;e again&s;t the Sinner to procure his puni&s;hment? And the re&s;olution of it is in Sum; <HI>That he doth it by ca&s;ting the Robe of Chri&s;ts Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s over the Sinner, and &s;o covering his Sin out of his &s;ight.</HI> And here two things offer them&s;elves to con&s;ideration,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t</HI> is a <HI>Robe</HI> &s;uita|ble and &s;ufficient to cover our Sins.</P>
<P N="2">2. How God ca&s;ts it over us to this purpo&s;e?</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t</HI> is a <HI>Robe</HI> &s;uffi|cient and &s;uitable to cover our Sins. As Sin is com|pared in Scripture to our Nakedne&s;s and Shame, &s;o is Chri&s;ts Righteou&s;ne&s;s re&s;embled by a Robe provided to cover it withal: and as it was Sin that fir&s;t gave occa&s;ion for mans needing &s;omething to cover his Body, &s;o it introduceth the nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t to hide the nakedne&s;s and filthine&s;s of our
<PB N="72" REF="000965_0071_0FADE6E253B040B0">
Souls. This is de&s;igned by <HI>the be&s;t Robe, Luk.</HI> 15.22. This is pointed at in the <HI>White Raiment, Rev.</HI> 3.18. And this is the <HI>Wedding Garment, Matth.</HI> 22.11. Now this <HI>Robe</HI> is made of the <HI>Active</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive</HI> Obedience of Chri&s;t, for the matter of it. By the former of the&s;e he kept the Law exactly, <HI>Fulfilling all Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Matth.</HI> 3.15. He was <HI>Holy, Harmle&s;s, Undefiled, and without Spot.</HI> By the latter he made full &s;atisfaction to the Law in all its demands, by bearing the whole penalty that was threatned in it for Sin. And the &s;ufficiency of this Garment to cover all the Guilt of our Sin herein appears.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Righteou&s;ne&s;s it &s;elf an&s;wered the Law in the utmo&s;t extent of it; &s;o that it is wide enough and large enough to cover all Guilt. Chri&s;t bare the penalty to the full which the Law exacted; he bare the whole weight of that wrath which was due to man for Sin. His Righteou&s;ne&s;s therefore is able to hide the greate&s;t and mo&s;t multiplied tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions out of &s;ight: the Law can ask no more than there is in that, to an&s;wer God as a Judge, who is fully plea&s;ed with the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is enough in it to Cloath all that come to him for it. It is called <HI>Everla&s;ting Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Dan.</HI> 9.24. becau&s;e it will hold out as far as there is occa&s;ion for it: there may be Garments cut out of it for as many as ask for them, and to &s;pare: it can never have an end: the Vertue of Chri&s;ts &s;atisfaction is Infinite, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.25. All are therefore invited to come for it, and a promi&s;e is made that
<PB N="73" REF="000965_0072_0FADE6E310E48238">
none that do come &s;hall be rejected. It is called <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, Phil.</HI> 3.9. becau&s;e the per&s;on who&s;e it was, or who performed it, was God, and &s;o put a Divine Vertue into it, making it infinitely exten&s;ive.</P>
<P N="3">3. This Righteou&s;ne&s;s was provided on purpo&s;e for this end; it was prepared to cover the Guilt of Sin. As the Active Obedience of Chri&s;t was to purcha&s;e for us the inheritance, &s;o his Pa&s;&s;ive was to &s;atisfy Revenging Ju&s;tice on our account, by Vertue whereof our Guilt comes to be hidden out of it's &s;ight, by the ca&s;ting of this over it. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t neither Lived for him&s;elf, nor Dyed for him&s;elf.</HI> The Son of God needed no Active Obedience to Ju&s;tify him, being a Per&s;on above Law; nor did Chri&s;t need a Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience to &s;atisfy for him|&s;elf, as man, being perfectly righteous: He there|fore <HI>Gave him&s;elf for us, Gal.</HI> 2.20. And this was according to Divine compact, &s;o that it is the de|&s;ign of it, and it was laid in for this; and thus it becomes applicable to us, and &s;o is every way &s;ufficient.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>How God ca&s;ts it over us to this purpo&s;e?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He doth it by applying this Righteou&s;ne&s;s to us for our Ju&s;tification: which is fitly expre&s;t by his Clothing us with it to hide our Sin out of his &s;ight; for in this application,</P>
<P N="1">1. God having accepted of this Righteou&s;ne&s;s for us, looketh upon it as ours. For this rea&s;on Chri&s;t is called, <HI>The Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Jer.</HI> 23.6. And &s;aid to be <HI>made Righteou&s;ne&s;s to us,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.30. And this is a re&s;ult from the Everla&s;ting

<P N="2">2. Hence in the act of Ju&s;tification he confers this Righteou&s;ne&s;s upon us to be ours. Having already accepted it for us, he now be&s;tows it upon us; it fir&s;t was made ready, and then it is put on&punc; So that it is not ours <HI>Inherently,</HI> but <HI>Adherently,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Relatively,</HI> it is, in re&s;pect to us, not a per&s;onal bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a relative Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and in that regard fitly re&s;embled to a Garment, which is no part of the man, but yet it is his, and put upon him for a covering.</P>
<P N="3">3. In conferring this Righteou&s;ne&s;s upon us, he Cloaths us with it. He throws it over us, &s;o that we who were before naked, are now arrayed with it, &s;o that all our defects and deformities are hid|den under it: hence the Apo&s;tles expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>being found in it, Phil.</HI> 3.9. And it covers us all over, &s;o that whatever faults are in us, they are thus put out of &s;ight.</P>
<P N="4">4. Hereupon he judgeth of us by and according to this Righteou&s;ne&s;s. He looks no farther, as a Judge than to this: by it therefore <HI>we are made the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21. We are now, on a relative account, pure, and clear, and &s;pot|le&s;s; Ju&s;tice hath nothing to lay to our charge, becau&s;e we, having <HI>put on Christ the Righteous,</HI> are Righteous in him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>What advantage accrues to the per&s;on by having his Sins thus covered?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="000965_0074_0FADE6E6C2D357C8"><HI>A.</HI> Much every way: in particular,</P>
<P N="1">1. He is, in the Law account, as if he had never Sinned. For, whatever he hath been and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Law hath nothing to accu&s;e him of; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which cannot be proved, is in the Laws account a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> if it were not, and that which is hidden cannot be proved: when once Sin is covered, there is none to accu&s;e us, for if God will not, who &s;hall? if he hath nothing to charge on us, we are &s;afe: but he &s;aith, <HI>I &s;ee no Iniquity in the per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Hence he is out of the danger of <HI>Condemnati|on. Rom</HI> 8.1, 34. Condemnation is properly a Sentence pa&s;t by the Judge, upon a per&s;on Convict|ed to be Guilty, dooming him to &s;uffer penalty according to the mind of the Law: So that where there is no Guilt, there can be no Condemnation; and where there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion chargable, there can be no Guilt found.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence flows great Peace of Con&s;cience. It is the foundation on which our deliverance from the terrours of an accu&s;ing Con&s;cience is built: when that tells us we have thus and &s;o Sinned, &amp; thereby provoked God, it is hereby pacified, when it can look on all this Sin as covered. Now the <HI>Spirit of Bondage,</HI> which is rooted in every unpar|doned Sinner, is remedied, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.15. The Soul hath the ground of inward Tranquillity notwith|&s;tanding all; and hereupon he can, with the more humbling &s;en&s;e, mourn for his Sin, whiles he can mourn as one that hath a good hope, and is not &s;unk in de&s;pondency.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="76" REF="000965_0075_0FADE6E7A70E8CE8">4. He hath great liberty of acce&s;s with bold|ne&s;s to the Throne of Grace; there is &s;uch a li|berty which Gods Children enjoy, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.16. and this is that which principally contributes to it.

<P N="2">2. Hence when they are judged, they mu&s;t needs be condemned; this follows upon the con|&s;ideration of Gods Holine&s;s and Relative Ju&s;tice.

<P N="1">1. Con&s;ider, you are all of you by Sin become Guilty before God; <HI>all the world</HI> by nature are in this condition, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.19. Whatever other difference the Go&s;pel priviledges have made be|tween &s;ome and others, which are great, and are not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, but prized; yet herein all are alike. There is never a Child of <HI>Adam</HI> can ex|cu&s;e him&s;elf from Sin; and Guilt is an in&s;epara|ble concomitant of Sin, according to the Law un|der which you are; that hath &s;aid, <HI>Ezek</HI> 18.4. <HI>The Soul that Sins, that Soul &s;hall dy</HI>; and there is no man, whiles under the Law, that can exemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him&s;elf from it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence except your &s;ins are covered, you are undone; if Sin ri&s;e up and appear again&s;t you, when you come to your trial, it will procure that Condemnation which will ruine you for ever, read the Sentence, and that will be enough to convince you of this, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.34. <HI>Depart ye Cur&s;ed, &amp;c.</HI> and is not he an undone man on whom this mu&s;t pa&s;s? for as &s;ure as you are Creatures, &s;o certainly will it be executed, if once it proceed from the mouth of the Judge again&s;t you.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is no other way but this to have your Sin covered; you may &s;eek to cover it out of &s;ight by your &s;ecrecy, but you cannot &s;o put

<P N="4">4. There is yet an opportunity to obtain this.

<P N="1"><PB N="83" REF="000965_0082_0FADE6EF1549E7C8">1. <HI>What is meant by the Imputation of &s;in?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We ob&s;erved, that the word in our <HI>Text</HI> is often u&s;ed for <HI>reckoning,</HI> or <HI>charging to ones account,</HI> or <HI>making a man a debtor for a thing.</HI> Man is by &s;in become a Debtor to the Ju&s;tice of God, and that expects &s;atisfaction of him, and accor|dingly chargeth it to his &s;core, that it may call him to an account about it: hence in the Impu|tation of &s;in; there are the&s;e things to be con&s;ide|red.</P>
<P N="1">1. That Sin is reckoned to the per&s;on. Here lies the foundation of it, and hence it is called <HI>the Imputation of Sin,</HI> becau&s;e all that follows, flows from it; and hence it is to be ob&s;erved, that this <HI>Imputation</HI> being a <HI>Foren&s;ical</HI> act, if the Sin may any way be fa&s;tned on the man as his, &s;o that he &s;tands related to it as his own, whether he him&s;elf hath actually committed it or no, yet it is ju&s;tly imputed to him: <HI>David</HI> did not with his own hand &s;lay <HI>Uriah,</HI> but yet the Sin is made his, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.9. &s;o, if a man owes nothing on a Debt fir&s;tly contracted by him, yet if he owes it by <HI>Sureti&s;hip,</HI> it is legally imputed to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence the Guilt of it is charged upon him; and indeed, the&s;e two are in&s;eparable in the Law; for looking upon the man as under it, it is impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould be charged with Sin, but he mu&s;t be reputed Guilty by it: that hath connected the prohibition and the threatning in&s;e|parably; it hath &s;aid, <HI>He that Sins &s;hall dy</HI>; and it cannot go back from it. Now the Charge of Guilt is nothing el&s;e but the a&s;&s;uring of the man,
<PB N="84" REF="000965_0083_0FADE6EFD9993518">
that he is by Sin become a Subject of Death; &s;o &s;aith the Law, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18 4. and a righteous God looks upon &s;uch a man, and reckons him bound over to dy.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hereupon the Law rigorou&s;ly demands its &s;atisfaction of him; the Law is ratified by the Law-giver, and he will give it its claim, and is re|&s;olved that it &s;hall not &s;uffer lo&s;s in a <HI>tittle, Mat.</HI> 5.28. It &s;aith, I find this man to be under the charge of &s;in, and &s;o to be Guilty, and I demand Ju&s;tice upon him: and its mouth cannot be &s;topt till it hath its demands an&s;wered: it is re&s;olved it will have its penniworths out of the per&s;on, be|fore it hath done with him.</P>
<P N="4">4. Hereby he is obnoxious to &s;uffer all the pe|nalties of the Law, in pur&s;uit of this charge; thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Imputation makes him a pri&s;oner of Ju&s;tice, and liable to the execution of the threatning: hence &s;aid to be <HI>in danger, Mat.</HI> 5.22. the word &s;ignifi|eth, <HI>one that is held in, and kept fa&s;t, as one that is im|pri&s;oned</HI>: this execution being the de&s;ign of, and that in which the Imputation is to determine. Im|putation claps an arre&s;t upon the man, which will be pro&s;ecuted, till Ju&s;tice hath obtained all its de|mands of him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In what re&s;pect all mankind by nature are under this Imputation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That all are &s;o, is every where a&s;&s;erted in Scripture; and is evident, becau&s;e the penalties properly belonging to &s;in are fallen upon them all&punc; See <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12.14. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.22. If all are Sin|ners, then &s;in is imputable to all, and if they are
<PB N="85" REF="000965_0084_0FADE6F0B7ED3708">
dead by it, it hath &s;urely been imputed. Cer|tainly that Sin which hath killed a whole world, is imputed to them, how el&s;e had they died by it? it includes old and young, per&s;ons of un|der&s;tanding, and Infants, who&s;oever de&s;cends from <HI>Adam</HI> by natural generation, and hath a rea&s;ona|ble Soul. Now there is a threefold re&s;pect in which &s;in comes to be imputable to mankind, and that righteou&s;ly.</P>
<P N="1">1. When it is actually and per&s;onally commit|ted by the man. I name this fir&s;t, becau&s;e it is mo&s;t plain and accountable. Sin is properly a <HI>Moral Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;eth a Law again&s;t which the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is: and to actual &s;in it is requi&s;ite that it be done by a rea&s;onable creature, capable of acting as a cau&s;e by coun&s;el: this there|fore is not imputable to Infants, for, though they have a rea&s;onable Soul in them, yet it is not in a pre&s;ent capacity of exerci&s;ing that rea&s;on; which want &s;eems not to be a fruit of &s;in, but a conditi|on of nature, and had not man fallen, it would in all likelihood have been &s;o; it is therefore &s;aid of tho&s;e that dy in their Infancy, <HI>That they have not &s;inned after the &s;imilitude of Adams Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, Rom.</HI> 5.14. Though how &s;oon they di&s;cover their na|tural corruption is lamentably to be ob&s;erved; however this extends to all men without excepti|on, that arrive to any u&s;e of their rea&s;on; how actual &s;in will be charged on meer naturals, I can|not gra&s;p, though the want of the u&s;e of rea&s;on be a puni&s;hment of <HI>Adams</HI> &s;in; yet this utterly ob&s;tructs the rational acting of &s;uch an one, for
<PB N="86" REF="000965_0085_0FADE6F35053B3E8">
that he <HI>cannot di&s;cern between good and evil.</HI> But there is none that ever had the u&s;e of rea&s;on, but hath abu&s;ed it by &s;inning again&s;t God, and that both by &s;ins of <HI>Omi&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI>: he hath thought, &s;poken, done otherwi&s;e than the Law re|quires; we have a natural man characterized, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.10. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And none are exempted from it, we are told, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 58.3. <HI>They go a&s;tray as &s;oon as they are born, &s;peaking lies; i. e.</HI> they are &s;et that way, and it breaks out as &s;oon as they are capable, though in &s;ome more notoriou&s;ly than in others. Now there is no difficulty in telling how actual &s;in &s;hould be imputable to the per&s;on committing it; for, if all owe Obedience to the Law, their neglect of, or doing any thing contrary to it, cannot but render them Guilty.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the nature is corrupted by the inhe|rency of Original Sin. That there is &s;uch a thing as the &s;in of nature is evident from the word of God; it is called <HI>Concupi&s;cence</HI> or <HI>Lu&s;t, Jam.</HI> 1.14. <HI>Indwelling Sin</HI>; Rom 7.17 <HI>Sin that is alwayes pre|&s;ent.</HI> Ver&s;e 21 <HI>The Fle&s;h,</HI> Joh. 3.6. <HI>The body of &s;in.</HI> Rom. 6.6. <HI>Of Death,</HI> 7.24. <HI>The Law in the members,</HI> v.23. <HI>The body of the Sins of the fle&s;h,</HI> Col 2.11. <HI>The Old man,</HI> Eph. 4.23. Now all the&s;e point to the root or fountain from which actual Sin proceeds, and therefore mu&s;t intend &s;omething divers from it; hence we read of <HI>Lu&s;t Conceived,</HI> and Sin the i&s;&s;ue of it, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.15. Now this Sin is in all Adams Po&s;terity, born after the ordinary cour&s;e of nature; even Infants, and Naturals too: it is therefore u|&s;ually called <HI>Our Birth Sin,</HI> and <HI>Our Conception Sin,</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="000965_0086_0FADE6F4757BD948">
according to, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 51.5. And it derives from the corrupt fountain from whence we all proceed. <HI>Adam</HI> defiled him&s;elf, lo&s;t the Image of God, con|tracted the Image of Sin, and then he <HI>Propagated it, Gen.</HI> 5.2.

And though this be in one &s;ence a puni&s;h|ment fallen upon us for the fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, yet in it &s;elf it is really Sin; it is a Sinful &s;tate that we are in by it; the Definition of &s;in belongs to it, it is <HI>Anomy,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.4. Mans nature by it doth not an&s;wer the Law of Creation And that it is imputed is evident, becau&s;e it is an <HI>Image</HI> for which God <HI>de&s;pi&s;eth man, P&s;al.</HI> 73.20. It is that which they <HI>Dy</HI> for, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.14. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 137 <HI>ult.</HI> It is certainly in them, and therefore may be charged on them, and the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of their being found Guilty by rea&s;on of it, will one day be made good by him who is Judge of all: mean while the foundation of the equity of it is laid in that which follows: Hence,</P>
<P N="3">3. In re&s;pect of the Relation which they bear to Adams fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion That our fir&s;t Pa|rents became Guilty by their eating the forbidden fruit, is beyond di&s;pute: God had a Sovereign Authority to Command, and they owed him entire Obedience: the Sin it &s;elf was great, being a Vi|olation of the <HI>Sacrament</HI> of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> and &s;o the whole Law was tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed by it: and that they dyed ju&s;tly none can rationally doubt. But we are given to under&s;tand that they drew their whole Po&s;terity into the &s;ame Condemnation with
<PB N="88" REF="000965_0087_0FADE6F566283810">
them&s;elves, and this is clear from, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12, 17, 18, 19. Hence, though they were not actually in being, yet that Sin is imputed to them as theirs, and here upon they &s;uffer penally for it: their being born in Sin, and unto mi&s;ery is a proper re&s;ultan|cy from it. <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 12. The equity of which <HI>Imputa|tion</HI> is, in that God tran&s;acted with <HI>Adam</HI> at fir&s;t as a <HI>Publick Per&s;on,</HI> in whom he would have all to &s;tand or fall: he therefore repre&s;ented his whole Progeny, as a <HI>King</HI> doth his people, as a <HI>Father</HI> his Family: So that all Humanity being contracted in our fir&s;t Parents, humane nature be|came Guilty in and with them, as it was naturally derivable from them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>What is the state of tho&s;e that are under this Imputation?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In one word, it is a &s;tate of <HI>Condemnation.</HI> We read, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.18. <HI>He that believes not, is Condemn|ed already:</HI> By which we are given to under&s;tand how it is with all men by nature: all the World &s;tand Condemned before God, and there is not one clear of it, till by Faith in Chri&s;t they come to receive a di&s;charge. Now they come under this <HI>Condemnation,</HI> by the <HI>Imputation</HI> of Sin to them: for Condemnation hath a re&s;pect to puni&s;hment, and that always pre&s;umes a fault that hath meri|ted it: and hence, in a fair proce&s;s, the fault is fir&s;t charged and proved, and there-upon the Sen|tence pa&s;&s;eth. Now this mu&s;t needs be a mi&s;erable &s;tate, if we Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. That if God impute Sin to any, he will con|demn them for it; the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God as a
<PB N="89" REF="000965_0088_0FADE6F5D4188418">
Lawgiver and Judge calls for this. <HI>God cannot be|hold Iniquity</HI> in any, without dete&s;tation of it, <HI>Hab.</HI> 1.13. And the <HI>Sanction</HI> of the Law, by which he te&s;tifyeth this dete&s;tation of his, is that which he hath bound him&s;elf unto. As therefore God will charge none but Guilty Sinners, and &s;uch as he will convince of Sin and Guilt, &s;o he will doom them accordingly, for in this his <HI>Relative Ju&s;tice</HI> manife&s;ts it &s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. That if God do thus condemn, he will pro|ceed to Execution according to it. He will be as good as his Word, and the Condemned Sinner &s;hall find it &s;o to his co&s;t. God &s;aith as he meaneth, and will therefore do as he faith.

<P N="3">3. The puni&s;hment of Sin is tremendous. <HI>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Heb.</HI> 10.31. In this puni&s;hment God will make it known how hateful a thing to him Sin is, and he will do it by the fearfulne&s;s of it: hence the&s;e penalties are &s;et forth in the word of God after a formidable manner.

<P N="4"><PB N="90" REF="000965_0089_0FADE6F6AE412FC0">4. <HI>How this Imputation comes to be taken off from Sinful men?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In Sum, it is done by the Tran&s;lation of it from the account of the Sinner, to the account of Chri&s;t. There is no other way in which it can be done con&s;i&s;tent with the Ju&s;tice of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">: and in this way it may be, and is done for all that are pardoned. Of this we may take this &s;hort account.</P>
<P N="1">1. That where&s;oever Sin is Imputed, the Law requires &s;atisfaction of the per&s;on to whom it is Imputed. This is evident by the nature of impu|tation, according as hath been explained: for where God reckons Sin to a man, he gives the Law Credit again&s;t him for it, and makes him a Debtor to the Law; now the <HI>Law</HI> being a <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> is rigorous, and exacts all its debts: it will not &s;top its mouth, till compleatly &s;atisfyed&punc; <HI>Math.</HI> 5.18. So that it holds the man fa&s;t by ver|tue of this Imputation.</P>
<P N="2">2. That in Chri&s;ts Sufferings there was a &s;uffi|ciency to make this &s;atisfaction. This was nece&s;&s;a|rily prerequi&s;ite, el&s;e it could not have an&s;wered the demand of the Law for us. For, though it be not therefore our Satisfaction, becau&s;e there was &s;uch a &s;ufficiency in it, Gods acceptance of it being free; yet if it could not have an&s;wered the Law in all its demands, it could not have been capa|ble of Gods acceptance on this account: there was therefore enough in it to do this. Chri&s;t Suffered the whole E&s;&s;ence of the penalties that were due to us for &s;in; he bore the whole weight of the Wrath of God; <HI>He was made Sin,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21.
<PB N="91" REF="000965_0090_0FADE6F75461F8C8">
And <HI>A Cur&s;e, Gal.</HI> 3.13. And the Excellency of his per&s;on, being Divine, put that Value upon his Sufferings, that rendered them equivalent to the Sufferings of all his people: it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>the blood of God</HI> that was &s;hed, <HI>Act.</HI> 20.28.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it is con&s;i&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> with Gods Ju&s;tice, to ac|cept of this Satisfaction on the Sinners account. True, the ca&s;e is Criminal; the Sinner him&s;elf de&s;erves to dy, and if God had &s;aid he &s;hall dy, and no other for him, it had been very ju&s;t: but yet it is no wrong either to his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> or <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> to &s;ay, I will accept of the Sufferings of Chri&s;t for the Sinner. If there were nothing more to be &s;aid for this than that God hath actually &s;o done, this ought to be enough to &s;top our mouths, for <HI>the Judge of the World can do no|thing but what is right.</HI> But it is acknowledged among men, that a Prince may, if he will, although he may chu&s;e whether he will take another for the offender by exchange, if he freely offers him&s;elf: however, God is not bound to the Laws which men are.</P>
<P N="4">4. That God did, by an act of Sovereignty, ac|cept of Chri&s;t for this end. This is evident in the <HI>Revelation</HI> of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> in which we are told that there was &s;uch a thing: and all our hopes for Salvation by that <HI>Covenant,</HI> are built on this foundation; for we are Saved by Chri&s;t, we are therefore acquainted with a <HI>Covenant of Redemption,</HI> on which the <HI>New Covenant of Grace</HI> is founded; in which God the Father indented with his Son on this account, and made him a promi&s;e in
<PB N="92" REF="000965_0091_0FADE6F812806F58">
re&s;pect to it, that upon his Satisfaction the Vertue of it &s;hould derive to them for whom it was, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 53.10. And Chri&s;t dyed for this end, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.20. Yea he was <HI>made under the Law,</HI> that &s;o it might exact this of him, in order to our being <HI>Redeemed</HI> from it, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.4, 5. And hence all the penalties he underwent are &s;aid to be on the account of <HI>Our Sins, I&s;a.</HI> 53.4. And this acceptance was an act of Divine Sovereignty; God acted as a Lord in it.</P>
<P N="5">5. That Chri&s;t in the&s;e Sufferings bare tho&s;e relations to his Elect, which rendred them &s;atis|factory for them; he did all in their &s;tead, and that it might be effectual, he took &s;uch Relation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that rendred it &s;o in the account of Gods Ju&s;tice. Now there were two relations that he bare, which comprize in them all that can be required in this regard.</P>
<P N="1">1. Of a <HI>Surety</HI>; this is expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.22 Now a <HI>Surety</HI> is one that is bound with or for anothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to re&s;pond for him, in ca&s;e he him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> fails: and when it refers to ca&s;es criminal, he becomes liable to &s;uffer for the principal offender, and upon his &s;o &s;uffering, the Law is &s;atisfied, and he for whom he &s;uffered is relea&s;ed; for no Law requires double &s;atisfaction in the &s;ame ca&s;e: and therefore if the Law take its &s;atisfaction on the Surety, it exempts the offender him&s;elf; but there is yet more, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Of a Common per&s;on or repre&s;entative, which will yet be a clearer di&s;covery of the fulne&s;s of the &s;atisfaction. We therefore have a parallel
<PB N="93" REF="000965_0092_0FADE6FA93B92608">
made between <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>Adam,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.22. And <HI>Adam</HI> is &s;aid to be a <HI>figure of Chri&s;t, Rom.</HI> 5.14. Now <HI>Adam</HI> &s;tood as a publick per&s;on, repre|&s;enting his Seed; and &s;o doth Chri&s;t repre&s;ent his: hence as <HI>Adams</HI> tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was influential to the undoing of his Seed, &s;o Chri&s;t's &s;atisfacti|on is no le&s;s to the making or repairing of his. <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 18.</P>
<P N="6">6. Hence this pardon of &s;in removes our Guilt to Chri&s;t's account, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s to ours: this is fully expre&s;t, in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21. <HI>He was made &s;in for us, that we might be made the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God through him; i. e.</HI> Our &s;in was charged on him, and his Satisfaction went for it, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s was reckoned to us, and &s;o became ours: and this is done by <HI>Imputation.</HI> Nor can it be in any other way; it mu&s;t be ours either <HI>Relatively,</HI> or <HI>Inherently</HI>; Inherently it cannot be, neither can Chri&s;t be the real Sinner, nor can his Sufferings, which in per&s;on &s;uffered, be &s;uffered per&s;onally by us; but by this tran&s;action it beco|meth &s;o by <HI>Imputation.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. This is done upon our believing in Chri&s;t; they that talk of an Eternal Ju&s;tification, forget to di&s;tingui&s;h between a <HI>purpo&s;e,</HI> a <HI>purcha&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>application</HI> of it to us, which are not to be con|founded.

it cometh to this, then &s;in is no more imputed to us; and now, and not till now is the man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pardoned man.</P>
<P><HI>USE I.</HI> For Information, in a few par|ticulars</P>
<P N="1">1. Learn hence, that forgivene&s;s of &s;in is an act of free Grace. It doth not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, the man in whom there is no &s;in, but to whom God imputes it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; it &s;uppo&s;eth that there is &s;in, and that God might impute it if he would, and why doth he not? true, it is upon Chri&s;t's account, &s;o that it is not free to him, but purcha&s;ed by him: but in re&s;pect of us, there is no merit of ours in the ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the P&s;almi&s;t &s;aith, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 130.3, 4. <HI>If thou, Lord, &s;houlde&s;t mark iniquity,</HI> &amp;c. but for Chri&s;t's &s;ake he will not &s;o do; though the man hath been guilty of never &s;o many &s;ins, yet he will not lay any of them to his charge.

<P N="2">2 Hence we have a clear di&s;covery of the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of a pardoned man; well might the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> put that remark upon &s;uch an one; for indeed one e&s;&s;ential part of the mi&s;ery of Sinner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is that they are under the Imputation of Sin&punc; Whence ari&s;eth their obnoxiou&s;ne&s;s to the <HI>Fiery Indignation of God,</HI> which by this Non-Imputation

they are delivered from; by this the Wrath of God pa&s;&s;eth from them; and if God will not charge i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, their &s;in can never bring them into Con|demnation&punc; let them have committed never &s;o many or gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at &s;ins, they can do them no hurt on this account; they are thus put out of all danger of hell, and the mi&s;eries o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that place; and &s;urely he is an happy man.</P>
<P N="3">3. Learn hence the nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, in order to our forgivene&s;s. If he had not &s;uffered, we could not have been pardon|ed: for &s;uch is our relation to the Law of Ju&s;tice, that if once we have contracted <HI>Guilt</HI> to our &s;elves, there is a <HI>Law Imputation</HI> of it to us: and to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aking that off again, nothing le&s;s can be nece&s;&s;a|ry than that the Law be an&s;wered; and that re|quires &s;atisfaction, and will not take up without it. Nor was there any to be found that was able to give in this &s;atisfaction for us, but the Son of God in our nature: if he had not done it, no other could; &s;o that we mu&s;t have remained un|der the charge, how then could God have been <HI>Ju&s;t,</HI> and yet <HI>Ju&s;tifie us? Rom.</HI> 3.26 to him then are we to acknowledge this wonderful benefit.</P>
<P N="4">4. This tells us that forgivene&s;s &s;hould not take away, but encrea&s;e our &s;elf loathing. When God cometh to forgive us, he finds us Sinners, el&s;e we &s;hould not need forgivene&s;s; and in for|giving he doth not take away the being of the &s;in he forgives, or make us inherently righteous, though together with it he ever Sanctifies us; but withdraws the <HI>Imputation</HI> from it; but &s;till there
<PB N="96" REF="000965_0095_0FADE6FD55B42700">
is the vilene&s;s and the odiou&s;ne&s;s of it lying before us, and it is not le&s;s odious, becau&s;e God will not impute it; but the con&s;ideration of this rich fa|vour &s;hould make us to abominate it &s;o much the more, as it did <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 7.</P>
<P N="5">5. This &s;hews us whence the Con&s;olation of Gods people flows, under the &s;en&s;e of all thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ins. What is the rea&s;on why a Guilty Sinner, under the awakenings of Con&s;cience, and di&s;co|veries of Sin, is terrified, and ready to &s;ink into de&s;pair, going up and down as one amazed; when a Child of God &s;ees and knows as much by him&s;elf, as many and as great &s;ins that he hath committed, and yet can look upon them, though not without deep &s;elf a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ement, yet with a great deal of con&s;olation and triumph? Why the one &s;ees not the &s;in only, but the <HI>Imputation</HI> too whereas this man can &s;ay, that <HI>God doth not impute his &s;ins,</HI> and &s;o his Soul is comforted on that ac|count.</P>
<P N="6">6. See here the rea&s;on why &s;uch as have been great Sinners, and are pardoned, do abound in their <HI>love to Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>; there are none that are more carried forth with ardent affections to him, or more engaged to do or &s;uffer for him; our Sa|viour gives the rea&s;on of it, <HI>Luk.</HI> 7.47. who e|ver more engaged in &s;etting forth the riches of Grace tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>&s;oul</HI>? 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15, 16. and why? but becau&s;e &s;uch an one &s;ees that his debt and forfeiture was very great, he was <HI>Ten thou&s;and Talents</HI> in arrears, his &s;core was formidable, but
<PB N="97" REF="000965_0096_0FADE6FE23403350">
it is all cro&s;t, there is not one that &s;tands on the Account book again&s;t him.</P>
<P><HI>USE II.</HI> Let this be to Exhort us all to &s;eek after forgivene&s;s; and one would think it &s;hould be enough to put us all upon it to &s;ee this &s;ecured&punc; For Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. Till your Sins are forgiven, they are impu|ted. All the Sin, the Guilt whereof derives to any of the Children of men, &s;tands out again&s;t them, till a pardon removes it, by taking away the Im|putation: his whole account abides on record, and is not cro&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Your danger by this is very great. You can|not an&s;wer the Ju&s;tice of God for one of the&s;e Sins, and what an innumerable Company of them is there? So that you go in continual hazard of being laid up by Ju&s;tice, and pro&s;ecuted for them, and then what a woful condition are you in? Our Saviour therefore advi&s;eth, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.48, 49.</P>
<P N="3">3. When once you are pardoned, there is no more imputation, that pa&s;&s;eth off with it. As God &s;eeth no Sin, &s;o he will charge none: he faith of every one whom he forgiveth, that <HI>none of his Iniquities &s;hall be remembered again&s;t him.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Hence now you may look upon your &s;elves, yea, your &s;ins, without dread. This takes away the ground of terrours, becau&s;e <HI>it blots out the Hand writing that was again&s;t you.</HI> If, when the Books are opened, there is nothing there to be &s;een, but it hath the lines of Chri&s;t's Blood cro&s;&s;ing it, or his Satisfaction and Payment char|ged
<PB N="98" REF="000965_0097_0FADE6FED1A05058">
on the other &s;ide, all is &s;afe and well. And for help, remember,</P>
<P N="1">1. Your &s;ins mu&s;t be imputed &s;ome where. The Ju&s;tice of God requires this.</P>
<P N="2">2. Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath enough in his Satisfaction to an&s;wer for them, and &s;o to remove the Impu|tation to his &s;core: there is nothing wanting in his Righteou&s;ne&s;s to an&s;wer all.</P>
<P N="3">3. He offers it to you to be made yours. This is the de&s;ign of the Go&s;pel treaty, to propo&s;e Chri&s;t to Sinners; and that is one thing in it, to be their <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 1.30 And what is this for, but that he may di&s;charge the Debt or Imputation for them?</P>
<P N="4">4. If you would have it, you mu&s;t go to Chri&s;t, and believe in him for it. It comes in by believ|ing; and Chri&s;t is the author of that faith, it mu&s;t be fetched from him; none but Believers can &s;hare in this Imputation of his Obedience. Come then to him, wait on him, &s;eek him to cure you of your Unbelief, and give you faith.</P>
<P N="5">5. And you mu&s;t renounce all your other de|pendencies. If you rely on a righteou&s;ne&s;s of your own, that will never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o; Ju&s;tice is not &s;atis|fyed with it; it cannot an&s;wer the Law for you.

There is an hone&s;t <HI>Craft,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.16. and there is a di&s;hone&s;t one, which is pointed at in our <HI>Text</HI>: and there are many things in which this Guile is practi&s;ed; there is <HI>Guile</HI> in mens words, &s;uch is <HI>Flattery, P&s;al</HI> 12.2, 3 and <HI>Lying</HI> to deceive, <HI>Mic.</HI> 6.12. And there is Guile in mens carriages, when they pretend <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> and yet <HI>lye in wait, P&s;al.</HI> 55.21.

But the root of all this lies at the heart, the fal&s;ene&s;s whereof puts men upon the&s;e Guileful practi&s;es: Hence <HI>Guile</HI> is in the word of God u&s;ed for <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI>; and to be <HI>without Guile</HI> for <HI>Sincerity:</HI> And when this is referred to the Spi|rit or Soul, it intends that there is an inward prin|ciple of it in the man which influenceth into his

Life and Conver&s;ation; and this points us to that <HI>Sanctification</HI> that is wrought in the man at <HI>Conver|&s;ion.</HI> But for a more particular opening of this, ob&s;erve the&s;e things</P>
<P N="1">1. That in the be&s;t of Gods Children here, there is a <HI>Body of Death</HI> remaining. We have <HI>Paul</HI> him|&s;elf crying out by rea&s;on of it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.24. And what el&s;e is intended by this, but the relicks or rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ins of the Sinful Corruption, which the nature of man is defiled with by the <HI>Apo&s;ta&s;y</HI>? It is that Sinfulne&s;s in our nature, which hath in it a repug|nancy to the Law of God, and cannot yield &s;ub|jection to it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7. And therefore is always <HI>Warning again&s;t the Law in the Mind, Chap.</HI> 7.23.

<P N="2">2. That in this Body of Death, there is a re|maining Sinful <HI>Guile.</HI> It is therefore called a <HI>Body,</HI> becau&s;e there is every branch or member of car|nal Concupi&s;cence in it: for, though the whole of it be mortifyed in Sanctification, yet there is no member of it is wholly de&s;troyed, but remains, though not in its reigning power; and there is no lu&s;t but a Child of God &s;hall find the &s;tirring of it in him, if he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ily ob&s;erve him&s;elf.

<P N="3">3. That this Guile doth too often wofully break forth in the Lives of Gods people. And this is a &s;ufficient evidence that it is there, for if they had none, they would never di&s;cover any: but how often doth it appear to others? And though it many times acts clo&s;ely and indi&s;cernibly to the world, yet they them&s;elves might ob&s;erve it, if they would be acquainted at home&punc; Do not good men &s;ometimes act deceitfully in their treating with others?

Yea he was almo&s;t gotten into a way of it, whence he prayes again&s;t it, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119 29. And how much of Hypocri&s;y is a &s;en&s;ible Believer ac|quainted with in him&s;elf, attending on his be&s;t du|ties? How many wry glances, and &s;ini&s;ter aims in his prayers, and hearing, and whole Conver&s;ation? Whence el&s;e is it that he is &s;o often at a lo&s;s what to judge of him&s;elf as to any thing he doth?</P>
<P N="4">4. In the work of <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> there is a new na|ture put into the man. The man that is here &s;aid to be <HI>without Guile,</HI> is to be &s;uppo&s;ed a true Convert, for there is nothing el&s;e but Guile in an Unconverted man; he is wholly acted by a <HI>De|ceived Heart</HI> which perverts him. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 44 20. But when God comes to Convert a Sinner to him&s;elf, he then makes a powerful and thorough Change in him, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.17. This is that which is called
<PB N="104" REF="000965_0103_0FADE62D9C931FE0">
the <HI>New Man,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to natural Corruption, which is called the <HI>Old man, Eph.</HI> 4.22, 24. This is called the <HI>New Heart,</HI> which God hath &s;aid he will give to men in this work, <HI>Ezek</HI> 36 26. And what el&s;e is the <HI>New Nature,</HI> but a body of Sancti|fying Graces, infu&s;ed into the man, by which he is Regenerated, or born again?</P>
<P N="5">5. In this new nature there is no Guile at all. The new Creature is altogether void of Sinful Hy|pocri&s;y, it hath nothing in it but what is pure, and &s;incere, and without Guile. We read, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.9. <HI>Who&s;oever is born of God doth not commit &s;in. i. e.</HI> Ac|cording to his new nature, or the new principle that is infu&s;ed into him: and it mu&s;t need appear to be &s;incere, and not Hypocritical, from the Con|&s;ideration of the Original of it, and that is from God; it is therefore &s;aid to be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of him,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.4. And <HI>Born from above, Joh.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.3. And <HI>of the Spirit, Ver&s;.</HI> 6. And is called the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> 2 <HI>Pet</HI> 1.4. It never con&s;ents to&punc; much le&s;s contrives any deceit or cheat, but is always upright in the exertings of it &s;elf. And therefore every Convert|ed man, &s;o far as he is renewed, &s;o far is he alto|gether without Guile. As Guile is a quality ad|hering to every Lu&s;t, &s;o integrity is no le&s;s to e|very Grace of the Spirit, that is in the Children of God: their <HI>Faith</HI> is <HI>Unfeigned,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.5. And their <HI>Love</HI> is <HI>without Di&s;&s;imulation, Rom.</HI> 12.9. And &s;uch are all the Graces which flow from the&s;e two, which are the root Graces in a Child of God.</P>
<P N="6">6. The New Nature &s;ets it &s;elf again&s;t the Guile of the Law in the members, in a Child of God. It
<PB N="105" REF="000965_0104_0FADE62E71F53710">
doth not only exert none it &s;elf, nor con&s;ent to that which the Corrupt part is acting, but it di&s;&s;ents from, and with&s;tands it. There is the <HI>Lu&s;ting of the Spirit</HI> mentioned, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.17. And there are two things wherein it di&s;covers this.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the Reluctancy of it again&s;t the Corrupt part in us, &s;eeking to &s;uppre&s;s and prevent it. So far as Grace is active in the heart of a Child of God, when it meets with a <HI>Temptation</HI> to Guile or Hypocri&s;y, it Re&s;i&s;ts it, bears its Te&s;timony a|gain&s;t it; influenceth the Con&s;cience according to its pre&s;ent activity, &s;o as to endeavour to Arm it again&s;t that part in him, which is eager and vi|olent for it: and this <HI>Paul</HI> de&s;igns in, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. When he &s;peaks of <HI>the Good he would do,</HI> and <HI>the Evil he would not do.</HI> And doubtle&s;s, many a time, by the help of the Spirit of God, he gets the Victory, overcomes the Temptation, and rejects the Motion with abhorrence.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the Repentance which it brings the man to afterwards. Sometimes the Law of the Mem|bers is too &s;ubtile and &s;trong, and <HI>leads the man Captive,</HI> and he is drawn into <HI>Di&s;&s;imulation,</HI> as <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.12. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The deceit|fulne&s;s of his wor&s;er part impo&s;eth upon him, and he plays the Fool; but as his Grace had no hand in it, but was meerly overborn; &s;o it recruits again, and what it could not prevent by with&s;tanding, it clears it &s;elf of, by Repentance. The Godly &s;or|row, bitter mourning, &s;elf-abhorrence and morti|fication he applies to it, witne&s;&s;eth for him, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.11. And this belongs to that <HI>Spiritual warfare,</HI> with which the Go&s;pel acquaints us.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="106" REF="000965_0105_0FADE630EAD3D248">7. That God, in the New-Covenant, values <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> according to this <HI>New Nature.</HI> It is true, the Corruption within us, is Originally our own, and we have rea&s;on to bewail it as long as we Live; and it gives the Believer a world of grief and mo|le&s;tation. And when we neglect our Graces, and allow or nouri&s;h our Corruptions, God, as a Father, is angry, and Corrects us for it: but however, God looks upon his People according to their Grace. This is the New-Creature, and they are judged &s;uch who have it in them. And where there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this warfare again&s;t Corruption, and Grace exer|ci&s;ed in <HI>Re&s;i&s;tance</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> God is plea&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to accept of us; and though he Charge the other upon our Concupi&s;cence, and will Mortify it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> us, yet he Chargeth it not &s;o upon the per&s;on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to put him out of his Favour for it.

<P N="8">8. Hence &s;uch an one is, in a Go&s;pel e&s;teem, one in whom is no Guile. Who,</P>
<P N="1">1. Hath been Regenerated by the Spirit of God, and &s;o hath a principle of &s;aving Grace in him. A <HI>Godly</HI> man, and one without <HI>Guile</HI> &s;ound the &s;ame thing in Scripture language: he is there|fore &s;o called, <HI>Context, ver&s;e</HI> 6. for by vertue of &s;uch a &s;aving change, the man comes to have a <HI>Right Spirit</HI> in him, as it called, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.10.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hereupon he cordially and &s;incerely pro|pounds the Glory of God as his la&s;t end, in his whole cour&s;e. Though he may mi&s;s it in the ap|plication in many things, yet this is the general

&s;cope of his life, and he &s;tudieth it daily; this is the great concern that lies upon him, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.3. And this is the natural inclination of the new na|ture in us: for it was put into us to enable us to Glorify God, and hath therefore in it a tendency to the end it was Created for, and accordingly prompts us hereunto.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence he abhors every thing in him that draws to the contrary. He finds enough and too much in him&s;elf which is mole&s;ting of him, and &s;ometimes wofully too hard for him; but he is grieved at it, carries it about as his burden, and cries out by rea&s;on of it; yea he is vile in his own eyes on this account, as he, <HI>Job</HI> 41.5. ac|counts it his mi&s;ery, that he is &s;o unhappily chained to it.</P>
<P N="4">4. Hereupon he lives in the practice of the mortification of this deceitfulne&s;s. As he doth not allow it, &s;o he cannot be quiet for it, but &s;eeks to have it de&s;troyed. We are commanded to <HI>morti|fy the lu&s;ts in us,</HI> Col. 3.5. and he makes it his bu&s;ine&s;s to do &s;o, he fights again&s;t it, he brings it to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t to be crucified, he <HI>prays</HI> hard again&s;t it, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.29. he <HI>hates</HI> it, <HI>v.</HI> 128.

Give me leave then to clear up this matter, and &s;hew the mi&s;take of &s;uch an opinion in the following Conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> and <HI>Sanctification</HI> are two di&s;tinct benefits flowing to us from Chri&s;t. How|ever vain men have confounded them, yet the Scripture &s;peaks of them as divers priviledges one from the other, &s;o 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. Chri&s;t indeed is <HI>made</HI> both <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Sanctification</HI> to us, but they are two things&punc; and applied to us after a different manner. We are Ju&s;tified <HI>relatively</HI>; we are Sanctified <HI>really</HI>; we are Ju&s;tified by <HI>Imputati|on,</HI> we are Sanctified by <HI>Infu&s;ion</HI>; Ju&s;tification is a <HI>Garment</HI> thrown over us, Sanctification is by a <HI>new principle</HI> put into us; Ju&s;tification is a <HI>Change in our &s;tate,</HI> Sanctification is a <HI>Change in our nature</HI>; in the one we are made <HI>legally</HI> innocent, in the other we are made <HI>inherently</HI> holy; hence the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e is &s;aid to be an <HI>Act,</HI> and the other is called a <HI>Work</HI>

by our <HI>Divines:</HI> becau&s;e the one pa&s;&s;eth upon us <HI>Declaratively</HI>; whereas the other operates in us <HI>Effectually.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That both of the&s;e derive to us from the &s;ame fountain of free grace. Mans whole Salva|tion doth &s;o, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.8. and both of the&s;e do ap|pertain to it; that Ju&s;tification is a fruit of meer Grace, we are plainly a&s;&s;ured, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24. And hence pardon is to be &s;ought of God, or <HI>for his own name &s;ake, Psal.</HI> 25.11. And our Sanctification hath the &s;ame original too, for it is a product of his meer good plea&s;ure, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.18. <HI>Grace</HI> there|fore, which is the &s;ame thing, is given of God, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 84.11. God ows neither of them to us, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave no way obliged him to be&s;tow them upon us rather than others. We have nothing but Sin, and Guilt, and pollution cleaving to us in our na|tural &s;tate, when God comes to pardon and puri|fie us; quickning is be&s;towed on them that were the <HI>Children of wrath, Eph.</HI> 2.1, 3. How then &s;hould our Sanctification, or being without Guile, po&s;&s;ibly contribute any thing to our Ju&s;tification or Par|don?</P>
<P N="3">3. That they are both of them applied toge|ther in or upon our <HI>Effectual Vocation.</HI> They are contemporaries: for though <HI>Divines</HI> do allow them an order in the handling of them, and an order of nature, and accordingly give the priority to Ju&s;tification; yet there is no di&s;tance of time be|tween the one and the other, by their acknow|ledgment; and they are reckoned as be|nefits joyntly flowing from our Effectual Cal|ling;

<P N="6">6. That the mo&s;t eminent &s;incerity of the Chil|dren of God, doth not amount to &s;uch a Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s.

Hence that ob&s;ervable difference, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23. <HI>The wages of Sin is Death, but the gift of God is Eternal Life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord</HI>: But this and &s;uch like Scriptures are abu&s;ively ap|plyed to our Ju&s;tification: for that proceeds accor|ding to the Rule &s;et down by God in his Law, being an&s;wered by a Surety for us; whereas Glorifica|tion is another thing, and is be&s;towed on &s;uch as were before Pardoned and Sanctified, and made meet for the inheritance, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.30.</P>

Now the ground of the certainty of this Connexion will be made clear in the following Conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">1. All tho&s;e, and none but tho&s;e that are Con|verted are forgiven. Conver&s;ion is the fir&s;t &s;aving gift that God be&s;tows on any of the Children of men; this is the primary de&s;ign of the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ations, <HI>Acts</HI> 26.18. When God comes to pur&s;ue his Eternal Purpo&s;e to any one, he then Converts him, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.3. In which Conver&s;ion he gives men <HI>Faith and Repentance, and then a Par|don; Acts</HI> 5.31. It is in Conver&s;ion that a <HI>quick|ning

principle</HI> is put into men, and before that they are <HI>Dead, Eph.</HI> 2.1. Dead legally, and dead &s;piri|tually: but as &s;oon as that comes in, they are now <HI>Alive to God</HI>; unto which life this pardon doth appertain; and as this priviledge is entailed on Conver&s;ion, &s;o it is re&s;trained to it, and no impeni|tent Sinne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s partake in it, they are in a &s;tate of Condemnation, <HI>Mat</HI> 18.3. <HI>Job.</HI> 3.36.</P>
<P N="2">2. In this Conver&s;ion, in and with which for|givene&s;s is applied, there is wrought an univer&s;al Change in the man. When God Converts a Sin+ner, by turning him from his &s;in to him&s;elf, he doth it not by force or violent con&s;traint, but cau&s;eth him to be &s;pontaneous in it, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 110.3. Now the will of the natural man, is in it &s;elf vi|olently and unper&s;wadably &s;et again&s;t this turning to God, being a lump of <HI>Enmity, Rom.</HI> 8.7. That then it may be drawn to con&s;ent, it mu&s;t have a <HI>New principle</HI> put into it; and becau&s;e the <HI>Will</HI> is a power in a cau&s;e by coun&s;el, it requires that the <HI>Understanding</HI> be al&s;o rectified, which is filled with crooked principles, <HI>Call good evil, &amp;c.</HI> and can|not do other &s;o long as it remains in its carnality, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 44 20. The New Convert is therefore &s;aid to be a <HI>New Creature</HI>&punc; and all in him to be <HI>New,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.17. And what is it wherein this change con&s;i&s;ts, whereby he is new made, but tho&s;e &s;an|ctifying graces that are infu&s;ed into him, and dif|fu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d through the whole man? <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.24. Such a di&s;covery then mu&s;t needs witne&s;s to the man that he is pardoned, becau&s;e it witne&s;&s;eth the <HI>Con|ver&s;ion</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="000965_0116_0FADE63B089EAE28">
that is an in&s;eparable companion or forgive|ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. God, de&s;igning his own Glory in forgiving the Sinner, doth it in &s;uch a way, as may be in all re&s;pects an&s;werable. Gods la&s;t end in all his works is his own Glory; that there are de&s;igns of love and good will to the Creature in many of the&s;e works, is beyond que&s;tion; but the&s;e are &s;ubordinated, and ever refer to that as their high|e&s;t aim, and are accordingly &s;o regulated as to ad|vance it in the accompli&s;hment of them: So that though God intends the Sinners Salvation when he Ju&s;tifieth him, and therefore together with for|givene&s;s, he entituleth him to the Kingdom; yet there are &s;everal <HI>Attributes</HI> that are concerned in this affair, every of which mu&s;t have its lu&s;tre herein: and as his rich grace and mercy are in this exalted gloriou&s;ly; and as his <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> mu&s;t be &s;ecured from wrong, yea and triumph in it; &s;o there is his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> here to be di&s;played, for God will be <HI>Holy in all his doings, P&s;al.</HI> 145.17. Now the <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> of God hath a &s;pecial concern here, in the manife&s;tation of the hatred he bears to &s;in, notwith&s;tanding the love he bears to the per&s;on whom he pardons; and if God &s;hould forgive the Sinner, and yet not take away his Guile, or purge him from his &s;in, and overturn the Dominion of it, he would &s;eem not only to love the per&s;on, but approve of his iniquity, contrary to, <HI>Hab.</HI> 1.13. On this account, wicked men, who for the pre&s;ent e&s;cape puni&s;hment think &s;o, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 50.21. And therefore to vindicate his holine&s;s, wherever

<P N="4">4. Pardon of Sin is a New-Covenant Ble&s;&s;ing, in which there is a perfect Reconciliation made between God and the per&s;on forgiven. God of|ten &s;peaks of a <HI>Covenant</HI> that he will make with his people, and we are told what are the benefits of it, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 55.3. <HI>The &s;ure mercies of David; i. e.</HI> all the good that Chri&s;t hath purcha&s;ed for them, whereof this is one, and is expre&s;ly mentioned, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.33, 34. Now &s;in had made a breach be|tween God and us; and when God forgives and Ju&s;tifies the Sinner, he thereby &s;ignifieth that he is atoned; and the Reconciliation is mutual, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19, 20. And there is no pro&s;pect of a Re|conciliation, either on Gods part, or the Sinners, &s;o long as &s;in remaineth in its power, and he is not Sanctified; this is the <HI>abominable thing that he ha|teth,</HI> Jer. 44.4. It is that which made the <HI>Separa|tion, I&s;a.</HI> 59 2. How then &s;hould he hold amity with one that hath nothing el&s;e in him? <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 5.4, 5. It is &s;in that hath filled the <HI>Carnal mind</HI> with <HI>enmity, Rom.</HI> 8.7. Till then he is Sanctified, and his Guile &s;ubdued, he cannot po&s;&s;ibly be reconci|led to God, and &s;o the New-Covenant cannot be plighted, without which he is not forgiven.</P>
<P N="5">5. Je&s;us Chri&s;t Redeemed us for his Service. Forgivene&s;s of &s;in is a fruit of Chri&s;t's purcha&s;e; he <HI>Bought it for us,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.6. And in the Ap|plication of a pardon, the Redemption of Chri&s;t is applied to us; and where any one part of it is applied, the whole is &s;o; for Chri&s;t can|not

lo&s;e any part of the de&s;ign of this great work; and we are a&s;&s;ured that he <HI>Sought</HI> in it a people <HI>to Serve him,</HI> which is promi&s;ed to him as a fruit of it, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 22.38.

<P N="6">6. Pardon or Ju&s;tification is in order to Glori|fication. They are Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nected, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.30. So long as the Law Sentence of Death was out again&s;t them, they were incapable in that &s;tate of being Glorified: when God taketh off the Sentence, it is always in order to the making them happy for ever: and therefore it mu&s;t needs be followed with the <HI>Making them meet</HI> for that Glorious &s;tate, which cannot be enjoyed by any of the Children of men, &s;o long as they have a Spirit full of Guile. The natural man cannot be entertained in the &s;potle&s;s Kingdom; nor can he re&s;ent the happi|ne&s;s

That then God may accompli&s;h this de&s;ign of his, he Sancti|fyeth them together with Ju&s;tifying of them. Chri&s;t had an eye to this, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.25, 26, 27. From all the&s;e Con&s;iderations, we &s;ee how evidential this being without Guile, is of our being pardoned; and how nece&s;&s;ary it is for us to be able to argue this from that, if we would not be mi&s;taken in our hopes and a&s;&s;urances.</P>
<P><HI>USE I. For INFORMATION, in two particulars.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Learn hence how vainly many pretend them&s;elves to be in a Pardoned state.</HI> How few indeed are there of tho&s;e that Live under the Go&s;pel, who do not pre&s;ume o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this? whence el&s;e is the quietne&s;s, and conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dence of the mo&s;t, under all the awful and awakning truths that &s;ound in their Ears from time to time?

And it is to be feared, that be&s;ides tho&s;e that walk open faced, there are a great many of clo&s;e covered <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> who&s;e own hearts would condemn them, if they would hear them &s;peak, how plau&s;ibly &s;o ever they carry it in appearance. And certainly if mens <HI>Lives</HI> are full of Guile, their <HI>Spirits</HI> are &s;o

<P N="2">2. <HI>Learn hence one rea&s;on why &s;o many Chri&s;tians are in the dark about their &s;tate of forgivene&s;s.</HI> How often do they complain that they are full of fears, and doubts, and hurries in their minds concern|ing them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lves; afraid they are not in Gods favour, that he hath not pardoned them?

<P><HI>IT is a di&s;mal di&s;tre&s;s to have a Con&s;cience bur|dened with the lively &s;en&s;e of the Guilt of Sin.</HI> It is indeed, of all burdens the mo&s;t heavy and oppre&s;&s;ing, none comparable to it, <HI>Prov.</HI> 18.14. It is enough to <HI>dry up the moisture, and con&s;ume the bones,</HI> and put the man into ince&s;&s;ant <HI>roaring.</HI> In clearing and confirming this Doctrine, we may enquire,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What it is that brings a man into great di&s;tre&s;s?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What evidence may be given to the truth of the DOCTRINE.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What it is that brings a man into great Di|&s;tre&s;s?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We may take a &s;hort account of this in three particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s is properly a &s;inking or over bearing per|plexity on the mind.</HI> There is indeed a di&s;tre&s;s that meer <HI>Animals</HI> may be in, ari&s;ing from an impre&s;|&s;ion made in their &s;en&s;itive Spirits: but we are &s;peaking of man, who is a rational being, and acts according to the principles of rea&s;on. It is true, that which gives occa&s;ion for it, may be out|ward and bodily, but the di&s;tre&s;s it &s;elf hath it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> great influence on the mind or &s;oul: and it is by
<PB N="132" REF="000965_0131_0FADE64AD6A56CA0">
rea&s;on of perplexity that is in it. For, let a man meet with what he may, yet &s;o long as the mind is quiet, he is not di&s;tre&s;t; and it mu&s;t be &s;ome|thing that over bears, or is too hard for him, for whiles he can &s;tand &s;teadily under it, and &s;inks not nor is &s;taggered by it; it doth not amount to a di&s;tre&s;s: Hence this condition is &s;et forth by &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 31 9, 10.38.8, 10.142 3. When a man is in trouble, and his Spirits give in and fail him, then he is di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That which giveth being to this di&s;tre&s;s, is &s;ome ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l either felt or feared</HI> The cau&s;e of it is always &s;omething that is really evil, or apprehended to be &s;o. It either &s;huts up the Spirits, that they cannot get out, or it breaks them in pieces, that they can|not be gathered up: and that mu&s;t needs be &s;ome evil; that which is good, and &s;o apprehended, di|lates them, and makes the man ready chearfully to entertain it. Man hath in him a natural aver&s;e|ne&s;s to evil, which makes him afraid of it, when he &s;ees it coming, and burdened with it when it is upon him&punc; hence he would willingly fly from it, and if he cannot, it t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bleth him; he counts it to be hurtful to him, and from the apprehen&s;ion of this ari&s;eth his di&s;tre&s;s: hence <HI>evil and bitter</HI> are put together, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.19.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That this di&s;tre&s;s is greater or le&s;s from the con&s;iderations of the evil that gives being to it.</HI> And this hath a re&s;pect either to the evil it &s;elf, or the apprehen&s;ion that the man hath of it in his mind.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In re&s;pect of the evil it &s;elf.</HI> And here are three things.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="133" REF="000965_0132_0FADE64BB08518C8">1. <HI>The Nature of the Evil.</HI> Though all are evil, and &s;o have a tendency to become di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, yet there are two &s;orts of them, &s;ome are bodily, &s;ome are &s;piritual; &amp; although men that are immerged in &s;en&s;e, are apt to be more &s;urprized &amp; perplexed with the former; yet the latter are in them&s;elves mo&s;t terrible, and when aright conceived of, mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, <HI>Prov.</HI> 18.14. And in this re&s;pect <HI>Sin</HI> is, in its own nature of all the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, becau&s;e it is the wor&s;t and mo&s;t pernicious: and &s;o <HI>Spiritual Plagues</HI> are the mo&s;t terrible of all.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The degree of it.</HI> There are different mea|&s;ures in tho&s;e Evils that men are liable to, &s;ome are lighter, others are heavier. Some are &s;o ea&s;y to be born, that though there be &s;ome inconveni|ence in them, yet the Spirit is not over born by them, and &s;o they are not di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; others are heavier, and harder to bear, and out bid the man: God therefore &s;o expre&s;&s;eth the Judgment that he was about to bring on them, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 7.5.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The pro&s;pect the man hath of the i&s;sue of the E|vil.</HI> The only inward &s;upport which a man in di&s;tre&s;s hath, is in his <HI>Hope.</HI> If he hath a pro&s;|pect of an end of his trouble, it gives him &s;ome|thing to feed upon, that is of the nature of a <HI>Cor|dial</HI>; and though it &s;hould be long fir&s;t, yet it helps to bear more patiently: but when he feels the weight, and &s;ees no end of it, it then makes it in&s;upportable. <HI>De&s;pair</HI> under trouble is the height of di&s;tre&s;s; it is a <HI>deadly di&s;couragement,</HI> when it cometh to &s;ay as they, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.11. <HI>Our hope is le&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="134" REF="000965_0133_0FADE64C52A99A68">2. <HI>In re&s;pect of the apprehen&s;ion the man hath of the Evil on his mind.</HI> Every thing is to the mind of man, as he re&s;ents it. If the man be ignorant of the Evil, he is not troubled about it; if he under|&s;tandeth not the evil in the thing, he maketh a light matter of it, and that is the rea&s;on why <HI>Fools make a mock of &s;in, Prov.</HI> 14.9. Which they would never do, if they knew the world of mi&s;chief there is in it. On the other hand, when men do over value the evil in the thing, it makes lighter troubles the more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; which is the rea&s;on why worldly cro&s;&s;es more perplex men, then Spi|ritual Plagues, and the lo&s;s of a creature comfort more oppre&s;&s;eth them than the lo&s;s of a Soul.</P>
<P N="2">2. It now follows to &s;hew the truth of the Do|ctrine, or evidence that a Con&s;cience thus bur|dened, is a di&s;mal di&s;tre&s;s. For which let the&s;e three Con&s;iderations be laid together.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>From the nature of Guilt.</HI> The right con&s;ide|ration of what is in it, will make it appear a di|&s;tre&s;&s;ing thing. We have before con&s;idered what it is, and there are three things in it which afford matter of di&s;tre&s;s to the man.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The con&s;ideration of the penalty it &s;elf, which he is bound to undergo,</HI> i. e. <HI>All the mi&s;eries that are contained in the Threatning.</HI> Guilt binds upon the man all the Cur&s;es that are written in the Book of God; and what a terrible burden is this? there are all the &s;orrows that men are expo&s;ed to in this life, which are uncountable and a&s;toni&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing: and there are all the puni&s;hments in another World, to be &s;uffered in the place prepared on

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Con&s;ideration of the &s;trength of the Obligati|on.</HI> Guilt is a pri&s;on that holds the man fa&s;t: the bars of it are too &s;trong for the whole Creation to be able to break: the powerful hand of <HI>Omni|potency,</HI> keeps them in, and the watchful eye of <HI>Omni&s;ciency</HI> guards them, &s;o that there is no po&s;&s;i|bility of making an e&s;cape: the Sentence declar|ing them Guilty is po&s;itive, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. The God who hath declared it <HI>is of One Mind, and cannot re|pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>: He hath &s;aid the Sinner &s;hall Dy, and he will accompli&s;h it, either in him or his Surety.

By Guilt the Sinner <HI>Falls into Gods Hands,</HI> and that is <HI>a fearful thing. Heb.</HI> 10 31.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Con&s;ideration of the danger which by rea&s;on of Guilt, the man is every moment expo&s;ed unto</HI>: It lays the Sinner open to pre&s;ent Execution. There is no time prefixed in the Law, how long it &s;hall be before the Sentence &s;hall take place, and fall on the &s;inner in its whole weight. He is no &s;ooner a Sinner, but Guilty, and no &s;ooner Guilty but ex|po&s;ed, and God may, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he plea&s;e, in that in&s;tant Arreign, Judge, Condemn, and Damn him; all the Patience extended to him, is of meer Sovereignty.

<P N="2">2. <HI>From the nature of Con&s;cience.</HI> I &s;hall here only con&s;ider it from its Office to bind this Guilt upon the man, and di&s;tre&s;s him with it, and when God &s;ets it to its work, it will do it to purpo&s;e; here,</P>
<P N="1">1. Con&s;cience is a <HI>Statute Book.</HI> In it are en|graven the Laws of God, by which men are to be Judged, and there they are to read. The&s;e re|cords are much blurred in natural men, however, meer <HI>Heathen</HI> have enough to convince, and con&s;e|quently to condemn them: they are &s;aid to be <HI>A Law to them&s;elves, Rom.</HI> 2.14.

And when Con&s;cience hath been enlightned by the Word, it is yet more fitted to di&s;charge this Office.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;cience is a <HI>Regi&s;ter.</HI> It is a Book of re|cords in which all matters of fact are fairly written and re&s;erved. Man may for the pre&s;ent have for|gotten a great many things, but they are faithfully entred in the rolls of Con&s;cience, and he &s;hall there read them &s;ooner or later: they are there graven indelebly, <HI>As with a Pen of Iron, and point of a diamond, in the Rock</HI>: and not one &s;in that he was ever Guil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of&punc; but is there upon the file, to be produced again&s;t him, for which rea&s;on it is called a <HI>Book, Rev.</HI> 20.12.</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;cience is a <HI>Witne&s;s</HI> to matters of fact.
<PB N="137" REF="000965_0136_0FADE650CE9AA1D8">

Nor will the man dare to deny, when Con&s;cience &s;tares him in the face and terrifyeth him.</P>
<P N="4">4. Con&s;cience is an <HI>Accu&s;er.</HI> This is one office it bears under God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.15. And though, for the pre&s;ent, men bribe and baffle their Con&s;ciences, and make them to hold their peace, yet they will certainly betray them; and when there is neither Man, Angel, nor Devil appears, to lay any thing to their charge, this will haunt them with its re|flections, and give them no re&s;t. Yea, how often doth it blab all, and force a confe&s;&s;ion from them before men.</P>
<P N="5">5. Con&s;cience is a <HI>Judge.</HI> It hath and keeps a Court in the man, in which it arreigns, tries, and condemns him; and when God gives it a <HI>Commi&s;|&s;ion of Oyer and Terminer,</HI> it will do it to purpo&s;e, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3 20.

and the matter of it is the Guilt ari&s;ing from &s;in, or Sin and Guilt which are in&s;eparable, according to the tenour of the Fir&s;t Covenant; and though the way of the Spirit of God with Infants be to us a &s;ecret, yet in grown per&s;ons, who are Converted by the Word and Ordi|nances, God leaves this Conviction upon them, in order to his drawing of them to Chri&s;t, and they are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by it; the next Invitation therefore is to &s;uch as are <HI>weary and heavy laden, Mat.</HI> 11.28.

<P N="1">1 <HI>You are certainly under all this Guilt, whether you will believe it or no.</HI> You brought it with you into the World, and if Chri&s;t hath not removed it by his Grace, it abides on you; yea, and you have encrea&s;ed it by every &s;in you have commit|ted &s;ince you were born: the lea&s;t vain thought hath laid in more for your Condemnation; and if you are Guilty, you may well think what is like to become of you, if you &s;o abide; that is one of Gods <HI>Attributes,</HI> as well as tho&s;e that vain men feed their pre&s;umption with, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34.7. <HI>That will by no means clear the Guilty.</HI></P>

<P><HI>THat Gods Children them&s;elves are &s;ometimes al|mo&s;t overwhelmed, with the apprehen&s;ion of Guilt.

<P>That the &s;en&s;e of Guilt is terrible to him that hath the impre&s;&s;ions of it on his Spirit, we have already ob&s;erved. That therefore which is here only to be enquired, is,</P>
<P><HI>How a true Convert who is a Ju&s;tified, &amp; con&s;equent|ly a pardoned per&s;on, comes to be di&s;tre&s;t with Guilt, which is removed by Forgivene&s;s?</HI> And this is a Ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> worthy our looking into. For the right &s;tating and explaining whereof I may offer the&s;e Con|clu&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is certain, that in the forgivene&s;s of Sin, the whole Guilt of it is removed.</HI> A Pardon hath a proper re&s;pect unto Guilt: it makes not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not to have been, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> takes away the merit of it
<PB N="145" REF="000965_0144_0FADE6583511FFA0">
but it removes the obligation of it that bound the Sinner to Dy; a pardon doth not take away a part, and leave a part, but it di&s;chargeth all; it doth not remit the fault, and retain the puni&s;h|ment; nor doth it abate the Eternal Puni&s;hment, and re&s;erve the Temporal; but it altogether clears the man from the Law &s;entence again&s;t him; for this rea&s;on it is &s;aid to be <HI>blotted out, &amp;c.</HI> God indeed forgives as a Judge, and corrects as a Father, but this re&s;pects not the Law, but the Go&s;pel, and the Correction is to heal the per&s;on; it is not an act of Revenging Ju&s;tice, but Parental Di&s;cipline, <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.24.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Ju&s;tification, in which Sin is pardoned, is not an eternal and immanent, but a temporary and tran&s;ient act.</HI> They that talk of an Eternal Ju&s;tifi|cation, mi&s;take the Scripture no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of it.

And &s;o there was a Ju&s;tification taken out for us, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.25. But the actual application of it to us is upon our believing, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.1. There is an act of God, which pa&s;&s;eth upon the Sinner, whereby his Guilt is taken off from him, and this is part of that which the Scrip|ture calls <HI>Ju&s;tification.</HI> And therefore before t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at we are counted <HI>Children of Wrath, Eph.</HI> 2.3.

<P N="3">3. There is a double con&s;ideration to be had of the forgivene&s;s which is applied to the Sinner, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In re&s;pect to his Per&s;on and State.</HI> The natural &s;tate of every Child of <HI>Adam,</HI> is a &s;tate of Con|demnation, as he &s;tands Guilty of the Imputation of the <HI>Fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and as he is Born under the power of In dwelling Original Sin, by vertue whereof his <HI>State</HI> is a <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Guilt.</HI> Now this &s;tate is removed in Ju&s;tification, in which there are two things done for the per&s;on, <HI>viz</HI> He is &s;et free from Guilt, and Condemnation, and adjudg|ed to Eternal Life; called <HI>a pa&s;&s;ing from death to life,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.14.

<P N="2">2. <HI>In re&s;pect to his actions.</HI> A pardoned ju&s;tified man is not pre&s;ently got rid of the Body of Death, but is &s;ometimes carried Captive by the Law in his Members: and hence he may, and &s;ometimes doth do the <HI>things</HI> that are <HI>di&s;plea&s;ing to God,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 11. <HI>ult.</HI> And this mu&s;t be by &s;in, for nothing el&s;e can properly di&s;plea&s;e him; and there is a farther con&s;ideration to be had on account of the&s;e, which we may ob&s;erve in that which follows.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That there is a &s;ort of Guilt that cleaves to the &s;inful actions of the Children of God.</HI> If we look on Guilt in a &s;trict legal &s;en&s;e, as that which binds

the per&s;on over to &s;uffer the vengeance of the Law, &s;o there is none can befal a ju&s;tified Believ|er, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8 1. The per&s;on is, by the ju&s;tifying act put beyond this danger: God hath &s;aid, <HI>Deliver him from going to the pit, I have found a ran|&s;om</HI>; he hath imputed Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s to him, and it &s;tands for him, and cannot cea&s;e &s;o to do. But yet there is &s;omething that may be|fal a Ju&s;tified per&s;on, that the Scripture puts &s;uch a name upon. <HI>David</HI> was &s;uch an one before he murdered <HI>Uriah,</HI> and yet prays to be cleared from <HI>Guilt, P&s;al.</HI> 51.14. What this is, we mu&s;t further enquire, only in general ob&s;erve, that it cannot re&s;pect the mans &s;tate, but his actions, and the con&s;equents thereon in the Providence of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That actual &s;ins are not actually forgiven the man before they are committed.</HI> Every Ju&s;tified Be|liever is under the moral Law as a Rule, though not as a Covenant; and &s;o every neglect of, or doing any thing again&s;t the Law, is truly Sin, and &s;tands in need of forgivene&s;s: and for this rea&s;on they are enjoyned to pray every day for it, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.12. This &s;aith they want it, el&s;e there would be no occa&s;ion to pray for it; and in|deed all the &s;ins we commit after believing, mu&s;t go to Chri&s;t's &s;core, el&s;e the Law would fall foul on us. This forgivene&s;s mu&s;t be taken out after the &s;in is committed; for if it were actually applied before, we need not go for it every day. God doth not, as the <HI>Pope,</HI> who pretends to be <HI>Christ's Vicar,</HI> give men <HI>Indulgen|ces</HI> for &s;ins to be committed &s;o many years

<P N="6">6. <HI>Hence Ju&s;tification in this re&s;pect is a continued Act.</HI> Divines rightly put that difference between Ju&s;tification and Sanctification, that the latter is a work, but the former an act. Now the Ju&s;tifying act, as it re&s;pects the per&s;on is at once, and in an in&s;tant: at what time God imputeth the Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to a Sinner, and reckons it to him for his, by this Imputation, he is in the Law account, a perfectly righteous per&s;on, whence it is ab&s;tractively declared of him, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21. And in this re&s;pect he is as Righteous in Gods account, the fir&s;t hour of his believing, as he &s;hall be in the Day of Judgment. But the actual forgivene&s;s of his particular &s;ins, is an effect or re&s;ultancy fol|lowing from this Ju&s;tification; and it comes in after the &s;ins are committed, and upon his Repen|tance and renewal of his Faith in Chri&s;t; and that mu&s;t needs be &s;uccedaneous: for it is con&s;i|dered, not in re&s;pect of God, in who&s;e Eternity there is no &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but of the Creature, in which there is a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of acts, and according|ly receives mercy from God &s;uccedaneou&s;ly.

<P N="1">1. <HI>That a true Convert may fall into &s;ome Con&s;ci|ence wa&s;ting Sin.</HI> He is not out of danger, yea &s;ometimes is &s;o overtaken. All the Sins of Gods Children are in a &s;en&s;e, &s;ins of <HI>Infirmity,</HI> becau&s;e there is a party in them that con&s;ents not, but yet there are &s;ome that have more of boldne&s;s in them, and do more nearly &s;trike the Con&s;cience, which are <HI>pre&s;umptuous &s;ins,</HI> which he prays hard again&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19.13. When prevailing Concupi&s;|cence hurries them to do things again&s;t the light of Con&s;cience, either to &s;hut their eyes, again&s;t it, or to be born down by the force of a lu&s;t, to commit it, though Con&s;cience &s;aith it ought not to be, this is a <HI>Con&s;cience wasting &s;in</HI>: and though it looks unlike the <HI>Spot of Gods Children,</HI> yet &s;ome|times when left to them&s;elves, they are thus en|tangled. <HI>Davids</HI> Adultery and Murder were &s;uch, and &s;uch was <HI>Solomons</HI> Building Idolatrous Hou&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That God doth not ordinarily &s;uffer his own to ly long under the in&s;en&s;iblene&s;s of &s;uch &s;ins.</HI> How long he may, is not for us to tell, yet he is wont in due time to awaken their Con&s;ciences, and give them the feeling of them. He &s;ends &s;ome Me&s;&s;enger or other to rou&s;e them; &s;ome <HI>Prophet,</HI> as he did to <HI>David.</HI> Either he meets them in an <HI>Ordinance,</HI> and cau&s;eth &s;ome word to fa&s;ten on them, or in a <HI>Providence,</HI> as <HI>Jo&s;ephs</HI> Brethren; and thus God doth in faithfulne&s;s, becau&s;e whiles

Con&s;cience is thus wa&s;ted and &s;tunned, it can do its Office aright in nothing, and &s;o the mans gra|ces are not exerci&s;ed in vigour, but mi&s;s their end, which he will not &s;uffer ever to be in &s;uch whom he hath planted his fear in.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Such a &s;in, of its own nature, darkens the mans evidence to his good e&s;tate, or &s;tate of pardon.</HI> One main evidence, we ob&s;erved, is our being without Guile; it is by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the Spirit of the exerci&s;e of his graces that we are to prove our &s;elves; and the more life and activity there is of them, the clearer evidence do they give; that therefore which ob&s;tructs their activity mu&s;t needs darken them: what then mu&s;t that do which binds them all up, as &s;uch a &s;in doth? when a man looks upon him&s;elf in this pickle, he look|eth to him&s;elf like a wicked man. Con&s;cience tells him, thou ha&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed me, and put the fear of God from before thee? and how &s;hall he now di&s;cover that in him, that may witne&s;s him to be a pardoned man?</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>God now righteou&s;ly withdraws the light of his Countenance from him.</HI> He witholds his Te&s;timo|ny; he doth not &s;peak peace in the man as &s;ome|times formerly; but is at lea&s;t &s;ilent, and lets him alone to the bitter remorces and reflections of his own Con&s;cience. <HI>David</HI> was &s;en&s;ible of this, and that drew tho&s;e petitions from him, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.11, 12.

Again, <HI>peace</HI> with God fol|lows upon <HI>pardon</HI> of &s;in, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.1. And the fruit of that is <HI>peace in Con&s;cience,</HI> and becau&s;e the peace

with God is &s;ettled, what &s;hould di&s;turb the mans peace within, who knows this? but all this will not do, for though the Covenant of peace be firm, yet,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There may be peace with God, and yet not &s;o re|&s;ented as to quiet the Con&s;cience.</HI> A man may have this peace in title, and yet doubt whether he hath it or no; and &s;o far as he doubts of it, he will be di&s;quieted about it; and it is no infrequent thing for Godly men to have awful fears in this re|&s;pect, we read of &s;ome, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.15. <HI>That go in fear of death all their life.</HI></P>

<P><HI>USE II. Learn hence al&s;o how injurious it is to the Children of God, to confound Faith and A&s;&s;u|rance.</HI> There are that Define Ju&s;tifying Faith to be nothing el&s;e but a firm and confident per&s;wa|&s;ion in a man, that his &s;ins are pardoned, that Chri&s;t died for him, and that he &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly be &s;aved; and that he who hath not this confi|dence is not a true believer. It is indeed the duty of every one to labour after the getting this per|&s;wa&s;ion, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10. But yet this is not the pro|per act of Ju&s;tifying Faith, as Ju&s;tifying, but &s;ome|thing that re&s;ults from it afterwards. It doth not properly belong to Effectual Vocation, but is one of the benefits flowing from it, and appertains to the inchoate Glorification of Gods Children in this life. Our comfort indeed flows from this, and hath its mea&s;ure according to the &s;trength of our hope on this account; and therefore no gracious &s;oul can have re&s;t without it. But yet
<PB N="156" REF="000965_0155_0FADE663A85DD8D8">
there is a Faith going before it, and is the foun|dation on which it is built: and that is the true <HI>Ju&s;tifying Faith,</HI> which is accompanied with Gods forgivene&s;s. I mu&s;t fir&s;t know that I have that Faith, before I can know that I am forgiven. The confounding then of the&s;e two mu&s;t greatly damnify us in an hour of de&s;ertion. What &s;hall a Child of God do, when &s;ome &s;in hath woun|ded him, Guilt &s;tares him in the face, and his confidence is turned into doubts and fears! how forcibly mu&s;t it &s;ink him into the mire, now to think, if faith were &s;uch a confidence, I ne|ver had any, for if I had, it would not be lo&s;t. Whereas the only &s;upport of a Soul at &s;uch a time, is to feel that there are the brea|things and goings out of the heart after Chri&s;t, and if that be not the acting of Faith, he hath none.</P>

If he cannot de&s;troy you he will do you all the damage he can, and his great bu&s;ine&s;s is to make breaches between you and your God; and that by driving you into &s;omething that is provoking, and when he hath &s;o done, and God is angry, to accu&s;e you to your own Con&s;ciences, and lay on load till he breaks your backs if po&s;&s;ible; fir&s;t to make you bold to &s;in, and then make you to de&s;pair by rea|&s;on of it, and this calls you to be <HI>Watchful,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.8.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Carnal Concupi&s;cence takes plea&s;ure in &s;in.</HI> Sin is Con-natural to the corrupt part that is in us; all the principles and powers of it are engaged that way: the <HI>Depraved Judgment</HI> approves of it, the <HI>perver&s;e will</HI> makes choi&s;e of it, the <HI>perverted affections</HI> are &s;et upon it; wicked men are in their Element when they are &s;inning, <HI>Job</HI> 15.16.

<P N="2">2. <HI>A natural Con&s;cience checks men for &s;in.</HI> It is its Office, according to its light, to call on men to do their duty, and reflect on and reprove them when they fail in it, and there is more or le&s;s of this activity in all that are not &s;eared, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.15.

<P N="1">1. <HI>All this doth not remove the Guilt contracted by &s;uch &s;ins.</HI> There is a certain Guilt cleaves to every Sin, as it is a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law of God, and expo&s;eth us to &s;uffer the evil threatned, which it highly concerns every one to get remov|ed; and the man is in a woful ca&s;e &s;o long as that abideth on him, and all endeavours that will not help to take it off are unprofitable.

Man is not to be your Judge, but God, who knows all; your &s;ecrecy is to him as the Sun light; midnight and noon day are alike to his all knowledge; when no eye &s;eeth, he looketh on, and maketh an entry: your denyals &s;ignify nothing to him, who knows and cannot be mi&s;taken; your fig-leaf excu&s;es can|not

Now our Doctrine fully re&s;olves this Enquiry.</P>
<P>Three things may here be &s;earched into.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That God is the author of this trouble by laying of his angry hand heavy on the man?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>How or after what manner he doth this?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Why or for what end he doth it?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That God is the author of this, by laying his angry hand heavy on the man?</HI> There are two things in this Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That God is the author of it.</HI> It is in it &s;elf a fore evil, though by the over-ruling Providence of
<PB N="176" REF="000965_0175_0FADE6795893D6F0">
God, it is made to i&s;&s;ue in good to &s;ome. Now there are two &s;orts of evil that the Scripture tells us of, <HI>viz</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> and of <HI>Affliction.</HI> As to that of Sin, however the permi&s;&s;ive Providence of God is conver&s;ant about it, and is not idle; yet we are utterly to di&s;claim his being the <HI>Author</HI> of it: but as to that of <HI>Affliction,</HI> God challengeth it to him&s;elf univer&s;ally, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.6. And looks on him&s;elf as di&s;honoured, if we do not &s;ee and ac|knowledge his <HI>hand</HI> in it, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 26.11. And this ex|tends not only to outward and temporary trou|bles, but to all the inward anxieties and terrours of Con&s;cience that overtake them, <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.65. God indeed many times u&s;eth the in&s;trumentality of &s;econd cau&s;es in the production of it, but &s;till he manageth them, and brings about the i&s;&s;ue ac|cording to his plea&s;ure: he terrifieth and amazeth them, hence that deprecation, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.17. <HI>Be not a terrour to me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That he doth it by laying his angry hand on the man.</HI> Here take notice of three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That God is u&s;ually provoked to anger when he doth thus.</HI> How far he may do it in Soveraign|ty to try his people, I &s;hall not here di&s;pute. <HI>Job</HI> is &s;uch an in&s;tance, who complaineth of <HI>Gods Ter|rours,</HI> and his <HI>writing bitter things again&s;t him.</HI> However this is one of the Judgments of God that come for Sin, and there hath been a provo|cation offered in order to it, for the mo&s;t part: and this the <HI>P&s;almist</HI> plainly intimates in our <HI>Text</HI>; for it was <HI>while he kept &s;ilence.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This therefore is an effect or di&s;play of his anger</HI>&punc;
<PB N="177" REF="000965_0176_0FADE67A2CC9E588">
God hath no affections properly; but there are the re&s;ultances of his will in the way of his Di&s;pen&s;ation to his Creatures, which carry in them a re&s;emblance of &s;uch a thing in us, which is thus expre&s;&s;ed according to our manner of conception: Afflictive Providences are therefore u&s;ually a&s;&s;ign|ed to his anger; holy men were wont &s;o to ex|pre&s;s their re&s;entments of them, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 102.9.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This &s;ort of affliction is a very heavy hand of God upon a man.</HI> One way to judge of the anger, is by the di&s;tre&s;s which the effect of it puts us to; if God lay the weight on a man, till it &s;inks and overwhelms him, that hand lieth heavy: and &s;o it is when Con&s;cience is let loo&s;e upon him, and chargeth him with Guilt, and threatens him with de&s;truction, this is for the kind, the mo&s;t in&s;up|portable burden that a man can fall under in this life, <HI>Prov.</HI> 18.14. And when this la&s;teth long, and hath no intermi&s;&s;ion, that addeth to the intollera|blene&s;s of it: when the <HI>Arrow &s;ticks fa&s;t,</HI> and cannot be plucked out.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>How or after what manner God doth this?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This may be con&s;idered either in re&s;pect of the thing it &s;elf, or of the way in which God brings it about.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we look upon it in regard to the thing it &s;elf. There are two things in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He awakens the mans Con&s;cience, and &s;ets his &s;in before him, in the aggravations of it.</HI> Gods hand is laid on the Con&s;cience; it was before a&s;leep, and though the&s;e &s;ins &s;tood upon record in it, the man
<PB N="178" REF="000965_0177_0FADE67B59EC0068">
took no notice of them, and &s;o they gave him no mole&s;tation; but now when it is rou&s;ed, and forced to do its Office, he is made to read the&s;e records, compare them with the <HI>Rule,</HI> and &s;o make a judgement of them, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 50.21. <HI>I will &s;et them in order before thee.</HI> And now Con&s;cience looks on them in &s;uch circum&s;tances as make them have the mo&s;t formidable and frightful a&s;pect: Did not <HI>Cain</HI> look on his through &s;uch a gla&s;s? <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.14. And <HI>Judas</HI> too?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He, together with this &s;ets home the awful ter|ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs of his Word.</HI> There are amazing Threatnings that there &s;tand upon record; there is a <HI>Flying Roll</HI> of <HI>Cur&s;es</HI> of a great <HI>length</HI> and <HI>breadth</HI>: Now the&s;e God not only &s;etteth before the man, but he throws them upon his Con&s;cience, and they fall upon him furiou&s;ly; he is made to take them all to him&s;elf, and &s;ay, <HI>I am the man, this is my portion at the hands of God,</HI> &amp;c. And when God hath by Con&s;cience thus applied them, the man is in his own feeling, as if he were under the im|pre&s;&s;ions of all this Wrath; he is in an hell upon earth, and feels the mi&s;eries of the damned upon him in great mea&s;ure; this made <HI>Judas</HI> chu&s;e to go to hell, to know the wor&s;t of it.</P>
<P N="2">2 If we con&s;ider it in re&s;pect of the way in which God brings it about, there are the&s;e things to be remarked.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sometimes he brings &s;ome di&s;tre&s;&s;ing outward Providence on them, and with it troubleth their Con|&s;ciences.</HI> A time of affliction, is often a time of <HI>calling &s;in to remembrance,</HI> a time of <HI>adver&s;ity</HI> is a
<PB N="179" REF="000965_0178_0FADE67BD048C708">
<HI>con&s;idering</HI> time, and God often &s;ets in with it, and maketh Con&s;cience charge home the &s;in up|on them which they have been Guilty of; thus <HI>Jo&s;ephs</HI> Brethren, when they met with hard u&s;age, <HI>Gen.</HI> 42.42. And it is a thing to be ob&s;erved, that frequently &s;ome frown in Providence, gives occa&s;ion to fearful troubles of mind, which en&s;ue thereupon; becau&s;e God by the&s;e frowns, brings them to con&s;ider of their &s;ins, and giveth Con|&s;cience a rou&s;ing jog upon it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sometimes God cometh to them in a word, and knocks them down with it at once.</HI> One end of the Scriptures and Preaching of it, is for <HI>Conviction</HI>; 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16. And when the Spirit of God, who&s;e in&s;trument it is, plea&s;eth to &s;et in with it, it &s;hall &s;o do to purpo&s;e. The man before &s;at regardle&s;s under it, and though it as much concerned him, it touched him not, he &s;lept under, wandred from it, or inwardly &s;coffed at it; but now it enters not his ear only, but ran&s;acketh his heart, divides between joynts and marrow, &s;earcheth him to the bottom: Con&s;cience is &s;tartled, and wounds his very Soul, the man quaketh as <HI>Faelix, Acts</HI> 24.25. And cries out as <HI>Peters</HI> Hearers, <HI>Chap.</HI> 2.37.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>God now lets Satan loo&s;e upon them.</HI> He in|deed is ready enough for this work on his own accord: for though he will keep men &s;ecure as long as he can, yet if God di&s;quiet them, and he cannot wheedle them into re&s;t, he now &s;eeks to hurry them over the precipice of de&s;pair: but God governs this affair too. He mu&s;t have leave, e&s;|pecially in regard of Gods own, <HI>Luk.</HI> 22.31. And
<PB N="180" REF="000965_0179_0FADE67E8A72F8F8">
when he hath, he &s;hoots in his fiery <HI>darts</HI>; and though the&s;e Temptations are wicked, as they come from him, yet they are righteous judg|ments, as managed by Gods permi&s;&s;ive Provi|dence. Now, they <HI>meditate terrours,</HI> entertain black thoughts, are full of horrours, and are rea|dy to precipitate into de&s;peration it &s;elf.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>And now God witholds from them his Con&s;olati|ons, &s;o that they cannot receive comfort or &s;upport by them.</HI> There are &s;uch Cordials in the Word, as are fitted for &s;uch Souls, and po&s;&s;ibly are offered them in the Ministry, or privately &s;et before them, but they put them away as not belonging to them, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ieve them not, but rather aggravate their trouble, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 77.2. And God witholds his Te&s;ti|mony from his Children, &amp; they can take hold of nothing to relieve them, can apprehend no faith in them, no love of God, no hatred of &s;in, which they dare call &s;o: And for others, they are as the troubled &s;ea, that can find no re&s;t: and they go a long time in this condition, God all the while appearing to them as an enemy.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Why or for what end he doth it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A. As God is holy in all his ways, and ju&s;t in all his doings, &s;o are all his works done in wi&s;dom,</HI> there is therefore a worthy de&s;ign in it; and here we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the u&s;ual provoking cau&s;e of this, is their &s;inful Guile.</HI> The deceitfulne&s;s there is in Sin and Sinners, is highly di&s;plea&s;ing to God; and though God can bear with a great many infirmities in his Children, whiles they are plain and hone&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="000965_0180_0FADE67FF0BD3410">
103.13, 14. Yet when once they begin to pract|ice deceit, to hide and cover, this is extreamly di&s;ingenuous, and he can bear no longer.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God hereby lets men &s;ee that there is no im|po&s;ing on him.</HI> And it is high time for him &s;o to do, when they grow up to &s;o much of Athei&s;m and impudence; men would el&s;e begin to argue that he either did not know, or not regard, po&s;|&s;ibly that he <HI>approved</HI> of their follies, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 50.21. but when he takes them in their devices, and makes their Con&s;ciences fall on them, and ter|rify them, he giveth them an awful proof of his <HI>Omni&s;cience</HI>: now he makes <HI>their Sins to find them out,</HI> and they are put upon confe&s;&s;ing that <HI>he is not mocked.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Herein he di&s;covers his ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure at &s;in.</HI> He hath indeed re&s;erved the full di&s;covery of this to be made in another World; yet he will make &s;ome di&s;plays of it here. He hath decla|red in his Word, that he is <HI>holy and ju&s;t,</HI> that he <HI>cannot endure,</HI> but will puni&s;h <HI>Sin</HI>; but men &s;carce believe it, becau&s;e vile Sinners go on and pro&s;per: but when he maketh them feel the wounds in their Souls, and <HI>they are &s;nared in their own handy work</HI>; here is terrible anger in this, and to be read in the faces of &s;uch; and hereby God giveth a further clear Te&s;timony how hateful a thing &s;in is to his Holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>He often doth this to give &s;olemn warning to others. His Judgments are to learn men Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, I&s;a.</HI> 26.9. He &s;ometimes &s;etteth up in &s;ight &s;ome Monuments of his Severity, that <HI>I&s;rael
<PB N="182" REF="000965_0181_0FADE680D1570A88">
may hear and fear,</HI> and be cautioned. When &s;uch things befal wicked men, they &s;hould fright others of their Companions from their lewd cour&s;es, and God expects it, <HI>Dan.</HI> 5.22. And they &s;hould cau|tion Godly men to be the more wary: and when &s;uch things befall Gods Children, how loudly doth it &s;peak to the Ungodly to con&s;ider it, <HI>if it be thus done in the green tree, what &s;hall be in the dry?</HI> And either men will take warning, or their Guilt will be encrea&s;ed by it.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>He &s;ometimes thus prepareth Sinners for Conver|&s;ion.</HI> The Spirit of God begins this work with <HI>Conviction of Sin, Joh.</HI> 16.8. In which he gives them a &s;ight of their Sins, and an apprehen&s;ion of their woful mi&s;ery by rea&s;on of them; in which he u&s;eth their own Con&s;ciences to amaze and terrify them; he holds the Sinner over Hell, and &s;corcheth him with the flames of it, and ma|keth him find him&s;elf ready to fall into the mid&s;t of them, thus to prepare him to give welcome to the offers of Chri&s;t, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15. And the mo&s;t guilful Sinners u&s;ually have deepe&s;t impre&s;|&s;ions of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>He doth it to humble his Children for, and cure them of their Guile.</HI> The&s;e are terrible temptati|ons, but they are <HI>to humble them, and do them good, Deut.</HI> 8 16. There u&s;ually is not a little of <HI>anger</HI> in this Di&s;pen&s;ation, however there is <HI>love</HI> in the bottom of it. He &s;eeth that in his Children that he liketh not, but his &s;pirit is grieved at, and be|cau&s;e he loveth them, he will heal them of it; and this is the cour&s;e he taketh; by this they are

taught what it will co&s;t them to indulge any &s;in, and keep &s;ilence at it, which embitters it to them, and &s;o brings them to <HI>Repentance</HI>: they humble them&s;elves before him, and the breach thus co|meth to be made up, and they re&s;tored; and &s;o al&s;o it is a happy mean to prevent the like after|ward, by giving them a remembrance that abideth by them, and maketh them more watchful as long as they live.</P>
<P><HI>USE I.</HI> For <HI>INFORMATION,</HI> in two Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Learn hence the great folly of tho&s;e who make no great matter of &s;inning again&s;t God.</HI> The gene|rality of mankind have low and &s;lighty thoughts of &s;in, and therein di&s;cover them&s;elves to be e|gregious fools: nor are the Children of God free from the remainder of this folly; but we have a clear evidence of the madne&s;s of it, in that here|by they lay them&s;elves open to the anger of God, and provoke him to lay his hand heavy upon them, and this is the very con&s;equent upon &s;uch an e&s;teem of Sin; it is a weighty que&s;tion the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> propounds, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 90.11. <HI>Who knoweth the power of thine anger?</HI> Surely there are very few that believe it, they would el&s;e alter their princi|ples and practices; <HI>The burnt Child will dread the fire,</HI> but Sinners have not felt the &s;caldings of Gods anger, the weight of his hand; and &s;o they de&s;|pi&s;e, otherwi&s;e they would think it a more dan|gerous thing to &s;in than they do. Sinners! did you but know what &s;ome have felt, you would

&s;eal to the truth of that, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 76.7. <HI>Who can &s;tand when once thou art angry?</HI> Well look to it, if you do not know, you &s;hall know, and you are in the ready way to bring it upon your &s;elves. When once you come to feel how heavy his hand is, you will wi&s;h you had believed it, and &s;ought to avoid it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Learn hence how vain it is for any to live quiet and &s;ecure under the Guilt of any &s;in.</HI> This is it that procures the heavy di&s;plea&s;ure of God, and as long as the Guilt remains, the rea&s;on of it abideth in us. Unle&s;s we can e&s;cape the hand of God, there is no ground for this &s;ecurity: as long as you have to do with God, you have no &s;afety; if the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ly on you Guilt unpardoned, be &s;ure it will bring his hand on you unavoidably, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 21.8. <HI>Thine hand &s;hall find out all thine enemies</HI>; and though you are never &s;o jocund and full of ea&s;e for the pre&s;ent, and feel no hand upon you, yet if God lay it on, your mirth is gone in that mo|ment: he needs do no more but give a touch on your Con&s;ciences, and that will make them to roar upon you like &s;o many ravening evening Wolves, and to rend you in pieces like Lions; this is the warning God giveth to all &s;ecure ones, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 52.22. Though you have health, and ea&s;e, and outward peace, and pro&s;perity, and enjoy of the World <HI>more than heart can wi&s;h,</HI> yet a <HI>Finger</HI> of God laid on you will do this, and bring you into unconceivable di&s;tre&s;s. Beware then how you live a day under the Guilt of one &s;in, le&s;t in a moment this Wrath fall upon you and con&s;ume you.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="000965_0184_0FADE6825DE9CA88"><HI>USE II. For Warning and advice to all,</HI> and that,</P>

<P N="3">3. <HI>Take heed of hiding your &s;in.</HI> Seek not to co|ver or extenuate, or &s;uppre&s;s the Conviction of it in your Con&s;ciences.

<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That which we are to make Confe&s;&s;ion of,</HI> is Sin. So all the three words in the <HI>Text</HI> import. What it is to Confe&s;s Sin is well to be ob&s;erved. Sin is defined to be a <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.4. Now Sin as &s;uch, will come under a double con&s;ideration, <HI>viz. Original,</HI> and <HI>Actual</HI>; and both of the&s;e mu&s;t be referred to the <HI>Law of &s;pecial Government,</HI> under which man was placed by God in his <HI>Creation</HI>: for nothing can be called Sin, but as it hath a reference to the Law. Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Original Sin</HI> hath a double re&s;pect, <HI>Privative</HI> and <HI>Po&s;itive</HI>; and both belong to the Nature of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Privative</HI>; Man in his Natural &s;tate is void of <HI>Original Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> There was a <HI>Moral recti|tude</HI> put into the Nature of man at fir&s;t, <HI>Eccle.</HI> 7.29. This is that which is mo&s;t directly intended, by the <HI>Image of God</HI> in which man was made, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.26. It con&s;i&s;ted in tho&s;e Graces of Sanctification, by which man was fitted for Univer&s;al Perfect Obedience to the whole Will of God. Man by the Fall hath lo&s;t this rectitude, and is Born into the World without this <HI>Image</HI>; And this is a Sinful &s;tate, for the Law requires it in him, and, as he was betru&s;ted with it, expects it of him. The

want of it hath rendred him Impotent as to his Duty, which Impotency is put into the de&s;cription of the Sinful &s;tate of Fallen man, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.10, 11, 12. And the man cannot an&s;wer the Law &s;o long as he is without it: and it is a Privation, for man once had the habit of it on him, and it was Con|natural to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Po&s;itive</HI>; Man is in his Natural &s;tate filled with the evil habits of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. When he lo&s;t the <HI>Image of God,</HI> he contracted the <HI>Image of Sin</HI> in the room of it, which con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>Cor|ruption of the whole Nature,</HI> as the Crooked bias which is in all his Faculties and Powers, forcibly inclining him to Tran&s;gre&s;s the Law of God, &s;et forth, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.13. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And it hath two things in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>An utter Aver&s;ene&s;s to that which is Good. i. e. Theologically</HI> &s;o. Man is a Rational Creature, chu|&s;eth under the notion of Good, and refu&s;eth un|der an opinion of Evil; but he doth this accord|ing to Corrupt rea&s;on, and not by the <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Re|ligion.</HI> And though &s;ometimes if it be in the mat|ter of it right, yet he doth it not aright: hence proceeds mens refu&s;ing Obedience, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78.10. <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.3. And this is upon Choi&s;e, flowing from a Cur&s;ed di&s;po&s;ition in them, and is Sinful.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A violent inclination to that which is Evil,</HI> True, they <HI>call Evil Good,</HI> and under that notion they crave after it, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 5.20. But it is a Corrupt principle in them from whence they &s;o do; and the in&s;atiable reaching of their hearts after it, is of the Sinfulne&s;s of their Nature. And this is

<P N="2">2. <HI>Actual Sin may al&s;o come under a double Con|&s;ideration, viz.</HI> the <HI>Act,</HI> and the <HI>Obliquity</HI> of it: and re&s;pect is to be had to both in the right &s;tating of the matter.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In re&s;pect of the Act it &s;elf.</HI> For though no Act, as it is an Act, is Sin, but hath a natural Goodne&s;s; yet actual Sin hath an Act which is the &s;ubject in which it is, and &s;o there can be no <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of Sin, without acknowledging the Act. Now in <HI>Divinity</HI> there are two &s;orts of Actions in which Sin is to be ob&s;erved;</P>
<P N="1">1. Commi&s;&s;ions; <HI>which are u&s;ally called</HI> Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions. When the man doth &s;omething that ought not to be done: and this prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly re&s;pects the <HI>Negative Precepts</HI> which do prohibit the doing of them. The Law &s;aith, <HI>thou &s;halt not Kill, Steal, &amp;c.</HI> when men do &s;uch things, the&s;e are Sins of <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI>: the&s;e ought not to be done; the do|ing of them therefore is &s;inful.</P>
<P N="2">2. Omi&s;&s;ions; <HI>which are comings &s;hort in duty</HI>&punc; And are again&s;t the <HI>Affirmative Precepts,</HI> which require us to do this or that: when we do it not, it is an <HI>Omi&s;&s;ion.</HI> Now though the&s;e in common account are rather a not acting than actings, yet in <HI>Divinity</HI> they come under actual &s;ins, becau&s;e there is the action of the will in them, which God hath a regard to, and is indeed the prin|cipal power in man which the Command hath to do withal: and &s;o God chargeth the&s;e Omi&s;|&s;ions

Now this Obliquity is con&s;iderable &s;everal ways, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In the</HI> matter <HI>of the Action: i. e.</HI> When the Action it &s;elf is repugnant to the Precept&punc; When the Law &s;aith this thou &s;halt not do, and the man doth the very thing forbidden; or this thou &s;halt do, and he neglecteth it.

<P N="2">2. <HI>In the</HI> manner <HI>of the Action.</HI> There is not only a doing, but a &s;o doing required by the Law, unto which if men give not attendance, but in a|ny re&s;pect decline from it, Sin is imputed to them, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.13. <HI>We &s;ought not after the due order; Luk.</HI> 8.18. <HI>Take heed how you hear.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>In the</HI> principle <HI>from whence the action floweth, or the heart that is in it.</HI> Let the matter be never &s;o right, yet if it be done with a <HI>fal&s;e heart,</HI> it is &s;inful; this is remarked, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 25.2. <HI>He did

<P N="1">1. <HI>An Acknowledgment of the Fact.</HI> For if we deny the thing it &s;elf, we by con&s;equence deny the Sin. He that &s;ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, I have not done this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> omitted that, doth wholly ju&s;tifie him&s;elf in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> regard: for if there be not the act, there cannot be the obliquity of it, which is a Law re&s;pect ad|hering to it.

<P N="2">2 <HI>An acknowledgment of the Sinfulne&s;s of the Fact.</HI> Not only that we have done, but have Sinned in to doing; it is one thing to own a fact, another to confe&s;s a Sin. There is many a man doth a|mi&s;s, and will not deny what he hath done, but ju&s;tifieth him&s;elf, &s;tands on his innocency, he hath done well, and needs not be a&s;hamed: this is not to confe&s;s &s;in.

<P N="3">3. <HI>An acknowledgment of the Guilt contracted by the Sin.</HI> Guilt is a relation cleaving to Sin, by the Law which &s;aith, the Soul that &s;inneth &s;hall dy: and there can be no true confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in without taking this Guilt upon us: Nor is it enough to confe&s;s it is &s;o according to the Law, for the heart may have a prejudice again&s;t the Law on this ac|count, and think it unju&s;t; but there mu&s;t be an acquitting of the Law, as <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 7.14. <HI>The Law is &s;piritual, but I am carnal, &s;old under Sin</HI>; and ver&s;e 12. <HI>The Command is holy, ju&s;t, and good.</HI> It mu&s;t be &s;uch a Confe&s;&s;ion as acknow|ledgeth our merit, that <HI>to us belongeth confu&s;ion of face, Dan.</HI> 9.8.

<HI>Hebrew</HI> Language hath one word for knowing and acknowledging, intimating that no &s;ound confe&s;&s;ion can be made, till we know the thing. Now the knowledge of Sin is not meerly &s;pecula|tive, but practical, and belongs to the Con&s;cience; it is done by reflection; Con&s;cience tells the man that he hath done the thing, and how he hath done it, and &s;hews him the Law which he hath broken, and the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of that Law, and the penalty that he hath incurred hereby, and it realizeth all this to and in him: and this is pro|perly the Conviction of Sin, this is the Spirits work, <HI>Joh.</HI> 16.8.

<P N="2">2. <HI>There is a Fountain of Corruption within, from whence every actual Sin doth &s;tream</HI>; and we ought to follow it up thither, and make Confe&s;&s;ion of that.

<P N="7">7. <HI>That this Forgivene&s;s is applyed upon the plight|ing of the New Covenant.</HI> As to the opinion of a Ju&s;tification from Eternity, or upon Chri&s;ts Re|&s;urrection, the mi&s;take of it hath been before ob|&s;erved: the promi&s;e of it made unto Chri&s;t, and the accquittance given to Chri&s;t for his Redeemed, was to be applyed to them in the Go&s;pel way and order. The actual Forgiving their Sins, belong|eth to the work of <HI>Application</HI>; and God hath in the Go&s;pel opened a New Covenant, in which he carrieth on the Reconciliation, &s;o that after Chri&s;t had <HI>Reconciled God</HI> to us, we are &s;ent to, and entreated to be <HI>Reconciled to God.</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19, 20. And there are the terms of the Covenant, accord|ing to the tenour whereof it is brought about; and therefore called a <HI>Covenant of Peace, Mal.</HI> 2.5. becau&s;e upon the making it with the Soul, the Peace of God is brought into it, to which belongs this Forgivene&s;s. And &s;o, upon every renewal of Covenant, upon any difference that Sin hath made: this Peace is re&s;tored, upon a new applica|tion of Forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Hence this Forgivene&s;s is always connected with Faith and Repentance.</HI> There is great du&s;t rai&s;ed about the word <HI>Condition,</HI> and whether Faith and

But in the New Covenant, they are acts of preventing Grace, and are not promi&s;ed on any Condition to us: all the offers of Spiritual Good are there made to Repenting and Believing: &s;o that both the Invitations of the Go&s;pel, and the Evangelical commmands Publi&s;hed in it, require this of us, though not of our &s;elves, but we mu&s;t wait for them as a Gift from God: yet this is a great Truth, that there are no other Saving benefits conferred on us without them, and there is a re|ciprocation in them, which is as much as is to be under&s;tood in calling them <HI>Conditions</HI>; viz. <HI>that without Faith and Repentance, there is no Forgivene&s;s</HI>: if God giveth not this Grace, neither doth he the other, <HI>Acts</HI> 5.31. and that whenever God be&s;tows the&s;e upon any, he together with it brings them into a State of Pardon: true <HI>Faith</HI> hath all <HI>Sal|vation</HI> &s;ecured to it, <HI>Heb</HI> 10.39.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>This Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin is a nece&s;&s;ary concomitant of the Repentance of Faith.</HI> And there are two things wherein this nece&s;&s;ity will be di&s;covered.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The promi&s;e of Forgivene&s;s includes this</HI> Hypothe&s;is
<PB N="225" REF="000965_0224_0FAE38A67392D9B0">
<HI>in it.</HI> That the Promi&s;es of the Covenant do run <HI>Hypothetically,</HI> is not only manife&s;t from the nature of a Covenant, but al&s;o evident from the tenour of Scripture expre&s;&s;ions about it, &amp; though there be &s;omething el&s;e be&s;ides confe&s;&s;ing put in, yet this is mentioned, in <HI>Prov.</HI> 28 13. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.9. Where is intended a penitent confe&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as accompanieth true Repentance; el&s;e <HI>Pharaoh</HI> may confe&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And &s;ee how God in&s;i&s;ts upon it, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.12, 13. And not one word of encourage|ment is given in the whole Book of God, for any to hope for pardon, who will not confe&s;s; nay hiding and covering is threatned.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There can be no kindly Repentance expre&s;&s;ed with|out it.</HI> No other way to te&s;tify it: For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sin must be &s;een in its colours if ever it be re|pented of.</HI> There mu&s;t &s;uch a Conviction pa&s;s up|on the man as &s;hall make him to know the &s;inful|ne&s;s of his &s;in, &s;o as to di&s;cover it vile and hate|ful, el&s;e he will not repent of it. Every natural man is in love with Sin; natural corruption calls it good, approves of it; he hath cho&s;en it, and till he hath another di&s;covery made of it to him, he will hold it fa&s;t, &amp; not let it go. In true Repen|tance there is a <HI>turning from &s;in,</HI> and it is the act of a rea&s;onable Creature, and therefore he mu&s;t &s;ee rea&s;on for it, el&s;e he will not, becau&s;e his heart is knit to it; and there are two things nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;een in it, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>mi&s;eries</HI> it hath expo&s;ed him to, and the <HI>vilene&s;s</HI> of its nature: for though a <HI>legal</HI> Repentance may be wrought by the former, yet that which is <HI>Evangelical</HI> will not be without
<PB N="226" REF="000965_0225_0FAE38A7B0EEA838">
the latter, hence both are put together, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.19. The end of Conviction is to drive the man to Repentance, and hence will naturally draw forth &s;uch a Confe&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Sin thus &s;een mu&s;t be heartily bewailed.</HI> There is a <HI>Sorrow for Sin</HI> that accompanieth true <HI>Repentance,</HI> and helps to make it <HI>unrepentable,</HI> and is to be a witne&s;s that it is &s;incere. It is not e|nough that the man leave off the former practice of the Sin, but Repentance requires that he ex|pre&s;s real grief of heart that ever he was guilty of &s;inning, &s;o <HI>Ephraim, Jer</HI> 31.18. And God promi|&s;eth to put &s;uch a &s;pirit into his people, when he cometh to turn them graciou&s;ly, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In which bewailing of Sin, there is, be&s;ides bitter grief for it, a lamentable crying out again&s;t it, as that which hath brought all our mi&s;ery upon us; &s;o <HI>Paul,</HI> in <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. And this al&s;o carrieth in it&punc; an implicit confe&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider, that he mu&s;t bewail it as his own, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 17.16.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The man mu&s;t judge him&s;elf for it.</HI> In true Repentance there is a formal proce&s;s in the man again&s;t him&s;elf. Con&s;cience doth, in the name of God, call a Court in the man; he Summons him&s;elf to the <HI>Tribunal</HI>; he indicts him&s;elf for &s;inning again&s;t God, in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing his Holy Law, chargeth it on him&s;elf as done voluntarily, by the naughtine&s;s of his own heart, finds him|&s;elf Guilty, and ratifieth the threatning of Gods Word again&s;t him&s;elf; all this is contained in that one <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.20. <HI>If our heart condem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> us.</HI> The word is u&s;ed for the pronouncing the

<P N="4">4. <HI>He mu&s;t turn away from it by an utter rejecting it.</HI> Repentance is a turning, and that &s;uppo&s;eth two terms, now the term from which, is his &s;in: and what manner of turning this is, the Word of God acquainteth us. There is a turning from it by ab&s;tinence, or leaving off, and that &s;up+po&s;eth a being per&s;waded of the unprofitablene&s;s, and vilene&s;s of it, which carrieth in it an <HI>acknow|ledgment, Job.</HI> 33 27. But there is al&s;o in this turning, an <HI>abjuration</HI> of it; the man is divorced from his &s;in, he ca&s;teth it off, re&s;olving n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave to do with it any more, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 14 8 <HI>Job</HI> 34.31. And this is attended with a &s;elf loathing, and hatred of his &s;in, and putting it to open &s;hame, which mu&s;t needs carry &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion in it.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>He mu&s;t turn unto God.</HI> This is the term to which all true Repentance leads, &s;o God points them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 4.1. <HI>If you will return, return to me</HI>; if a man leaveth off one &s;in, and dive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th to another, this is only a <HI>traver&s;ing of his way</HI>&punc; and proveth that he hath left no &s;in heartily. Now in our turning from Sin to God, there are two things aimed at, without both which there is no acceptable turning, and both of them call for confe&s;&s;ion; we turn to him for his favour, and that we may obtain reconciliation, and we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ek of him pardon, which that we may gain,
<PB N="228" REF="000965_0227_0FAE38A8E664CFC8">
he expecteth our hearty confe&s;&s;ion; and we do it with a full purpo&s;e to devote our &s;elves to his Service thence forward, and that pre&s;umes a con|fe&s;&s;ion that we have before been uneven in it, and &s;eek of him grace to carry it more uprightly afterwards, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 80.18.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>The Glory of God is much concerned in this Confe&s;&s;ion.</HI> It is &s;uitably accommodated to the way in which God will exalt his name in the Salvation of Sinners; for,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Forgivene&s;s of Sins is an act of Gods free favour to the Sinner.</HI> He was fallen under the Condem|nation of the Law, and into the hand of Reven|ging Ju&s;tice, the Sentence was pa&s;t upon him that he mu&s;t dy, and it was righteous: he him|&s;elf was utterly unable to &s;atisfie for his own Guilt, nor was there a ran&s;om price to be found in heaven or earth, among created beings, that would an&s;wer the demands of Ju&s;tice, or buy off his penalty from him: If ever then he be de|livered from the Wrath to come God mu&s;t pro|vide his own Satisfaction, and conferr it upon the Sinner, <HI>gratis,</HI> and he mu&s;t have it <HI>without money and price</HI>: Gods pardon is be&s;towed <HI>for his own name &s;ake, P&s;al.</HI> 25.11.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Gods de&s;ign in this, is the Exaltation of the Glory of his Grace, in pardoning the Sinner.</HI> God mu&s;t have &s;ome de&s;ign in all his Works, being a wi&s;e and intelligent Agent: this de&s;ign mu&s;t ultimately refer to his own Glory, for, being the chief Good, he mu&s;t be the la&s;t end of all things hence, though he aimeth at the Sinners

Salvation in it yet that mu&s;t be in order and &s;ub|ordination <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> own Glory; which can be no other than his <HI>Declarative</HI> Glory: for, as to that which is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to him, it is perfect, nor can it be greater or le&s;&s;er. Now, though his Ju&s;tice doth receive a wonderful illu&s;tration, and &s;its in State, in the way which he hath contrived to bring this about, yet the great <HI>Attribute</HI> which is celebrated in and by this effect, is his <HI>Grace</HI>: nor can we conceive how this <HI>Attribute</HI> could be more emi|nently illu&s;trated, than in this way. What greater Grace can we think of, than that the great God, who hath no need of the Creature, was highly provoked by it, and could have gotten him&s;elf a name for ever in its eternal ruine, &s;hould without &s;o much as being &s;ought to by the Sinner, of his own meer good will, provide &s;o richly for its de|liverance from Wrath, as not <HI>to &s;pare his own S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> but give him for a ran&s;ome.</HI> Well might the Apo|&s;tle a&s;cribe it hither, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.5, 6.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence this rich grace of his is to be celebrated by us in it.</HI> As we are the monuments of it, &s;o he expects of us &s;uitably to be acknowledged for it. We mu&s;t not only be the <HI>in&s;tances,</HI> but the <HI>proclaimers</HI> of this Grace, we are not only to be <HI>pa&s;&s;ive,</HI> but <HI>active</HI> in Glorifying God; and he hereby layeth on us the mo&s;t potent obligation hereto.

<P N="4">4. To the due acknowledgment of this grace, it is requi&s;ite.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That we be &s;en&s;ible how vile we have made our &s;elves by Sin.</HI> Sin is, by Gods holy and wi&s;e Or|dination, become the foil of Grace: It did not come into the world but by Divine permi&s;&s;ion, and had not God had &s;ome wi&s;e and holy ends in it, he had not permitted it, now this end, in regard of his Cho&s;en, was to take occa&s;ion by it to exalt his Grace in their Salvation: hence the viler they have made them&s;elves by &s;in, the more ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lted is this Grace in their Salvation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.20.

<P N="4">4. <HI>That we &s;eek this pardon in Chri&s;t's name, ac|knowledging our unworthine&s;s of it.</HI> It is through Chri&s;t that we obtain forgivene&s;s, and therefore it is to be &s;ought in him, or for his &s;ake: for it is through his Mediation that all this grace cometh to be communicated to us: and we &s;hall never go on his account, till we find that we have no other account to go upon; as long as we have a righte|ou&s;ne&s;s or worthine&s;s of our own, Chri&s;t is di&s;re|garded, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.2, 3.

And there is none who&s;e condition this may not be, and it is good to be laying in for it. Let this be particularly applyed,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To the Unconverted</HI>: Such as are yet &s;trangers

<P N="1">1. <HI>To the &s;ecure Sinner</HI>; who feeleth no trouble on his Con&s;cience, but all is quiet, and &s;o he looks upon him&s;elf unconcerned in this affair.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>You are Sinners.</HI> That is the condition of all men by nature, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12. Yea your whole cour&s;e in this world hath been a trade of Sin, <HI>Gen.</HI> 8.21. You have done nothing el&s;e &s;ince you were born but &s;in again&s;t God; this is the very Character given of a natural man, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 58. <HI>The wicked is e&s;tranged from the womb, they go a&s;tray as &s;oon as they are born.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>You are on this account Guilty before God.</HI> This is the &s;tate in which all men are by rea&s;on of &s;in, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.19. There is always a Guilt cleaving to &s;in, till by a pardon it be removed: where there|fore Sin may be charged, and is not forgiven, it inferreth Guilt; and every unpardoned one is under the efficacy of the Sentence.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence you have the matter of this di&s;tre&s;s on you.</HI> And what is it that is &s;o bitter and burden &s;ome to the Con&s;cience, but a Conviction of Sin, and ap|prehen&s;ion of the Guilt that attendeth it? It is a fear of the wrath of God, ari&s;ing from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n ex|pectation of having it fall upon us: whiles then you are under Guilt, there needs nothing but the awakening of Con&s;cience, and making it to feel the impre&s;&s;ions thereof upon it, to bring the man under the mo&s;t helli&s;h amazements that can be thought of. It is only becau&s;e Con&s;cience is a|&s;leep,

Your <HI>Fair Days</HI> are but <HI>Weather-breeders,</HI> and all the Sins with which you nouri&s;h this &s;ecurity will help to aggravate your Guilt, and make the remorces of Con&s;cience more &s;evere. Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Be willing to be convinced of you Sin.</HI> Have a care of &s;tifling the Convictions which God afford|eth you in his Word and Providence: take heed of hardning you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hearts again&s;t Coun&s;els, or &s;hut|ting your eyes upon the light that is offered you, to di&s;cover your Sin to you. What&s;oever content you find in thus doing for the pre&s;ent, <HI>it will be bitter in the end.</HI> God cometh now to &s;hew you your Sin in the way of a Treaty of Peace, and &s;aith, as <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.19. <HI>Know that it is an evil and bitter thing. &amp;c.</HI> And if you do not hearken, he will &s;hew it you another way.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>See the danger you are in by rea&s;on of it.</HI> If Sin lyeth at the door, you are in a perilous Condition, there is no &s;afety, the wrath of God is out again&s;t you, and Vengeance hangs over your heads: Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice, Truth, &s;tand engaged to do Ex|ecution

Now God hath in the Go&s;|pel made a Proclamation of peace to Sinners, and &s;hewn them the way to pardon: think then of this, and let it melt your hear, and drive you to fall down at his feet, and make the mo&s;t enlarged acknowledgment of your &s;ins, asking his pitty.

<P N="3">3. <HI>But he expecteth that you come for this mercy with ropes on your heads.</HI> He looketh that you &s;hould give him all the &s;ignal te&s;timony of a deep conviction that you de&s;erve no mercy from him, but that he do Execution upon you according to the demerit of your &s;in; and that you <HI>ly at his foot</HI> as tho&s;e that have no inju&s;tice to impute to him, if he &s;hould fall upon and de&s;troy you; and acknowledge his meer mercy in your pardon.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Negat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vely; it is neither the meritori|ous, nor the moving cau&s;e of Gods forgiving us.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is not the meritorious cau&s;e of it.</HI> We have already ob&s;erved that it is a free favour. It is indeed fir&s;t merited for us, before we can pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ake in it; for it belongs to Ju&s;tification: we are fir&s;t <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an&s;omed,</HI> and then <HI>pardoned</HI>; but our confe&s;&s;ion hath no hand in this.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Nor is it the moving cau&s;e of it.</HI> Among men indeed, a tender heart is moved by an in|genious confe&s;&s;ion, and humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and it makes us to relent, and &s;hew compa&s;&s;ion to a delinquent; but though &s;uch affections are a&s;|cribed

to God, yet it is after the manner of men, and warily to be under&s;tood: Affections are attributed to him in regard of the Effects which flow from his fixed and unalterable will.

<P N="2">2. Po&s;itively; <HI>this Confe&s;&s;ion belongs to the way in which God is wont to apply forgivene&s;s to Sin|ners.</HI> God de&s;igned from Eternity to forgive them, but he hath laid out this <HI>Medium</HI> through which he will bring them to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. How God treats with Infants, is beyond our deci&s;ion, but in regard of &s;uch as are of years of under&s;tan|ding, and under the Go&s;pel, there are two things ob&s;ervable.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That God requires this Confe&s;&s;ion of the&s;e that hope to obtain forgivene&s;s of him.</HI> The influence therefore of one upon the other, is only as it is the way of Divine Appointment to obtain it; the promi&s;e &s;o runs, <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.13. And that clau&s;e is in&s;erted, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.13. <HI>Only acknowledge, &amp;c.</HI> God will be <HI>&s;ought</HI> to for pardon, and there can be no asking forgivene&s;s without acknowledging Guilt. Hence, though this be Gods gift as well as the other, yet it is whiles the Guilty Sinner is pro&s;tra|ting him&s;elf at the foot &s;tool of Mercy, taking &s;hame to him&s;elf, that God comes and pa&s;&s;eth the act of pardon upon him, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.17. In &s;umme, where God giveth a <HI>Pardon,</HI> he gives <HI>Repentance,</HI> and where true Repentance is, there will be con|fe&s;&s;ion:

<P N="2">2. <HI>God will certainly forgive no Sinners but in his own way.</HI> Infinite Wi&s;dom hath contrived a way for the exalting free grace in the Salvation of Sin|ners, &s;o as with it to give lu&s;tre to his other

<HEAD>Forgivene&s;s obtained in the way of Prayer. DOCTRINE II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT is the Duty of all, and the di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ition of every Gracious Soul, to pray to God for, as they hope to obtain forgivene&s;s of him.</HI> They that would have it mu&s;t pray for it; and they that have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Grace in them will &s;o do.</P>
<P>There are two Propo&s;itions in the Doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is the duty of all that hope to be forgiven by God, to pray to him for it.</HI> That this is a duty is evident, becau&s;e God hath required it; though God hath purpo&s;ed to be&s;tow a pardon on all his Cho&s;en, yet Prayer is a required <HI>medium</HI> in order to the obtaining of it, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.37. <HI>I will be &s;ought, &amp;c</HI> God therefore connects their <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling</HI> and his <HI>Hearing</HI> together, <HI>Jer.</HI> 29.12, 13. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it be enquired, What dependance this to fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">givene&s;s hath on our praying for it? We may take this brief account of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Gods forgivene&s;s is every way free to us.</HI> We cannot de&s;erve it by any thing of ours. It is of the very nature of a pardon, that it is free. We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>provi&s;ion</HI> made in the Covenant of Redemption for our being pardoned, in which we were bought, and &s;atisfa|ction
<PB N="290" REF="000965_0289_0FAE38EDDFFD1E10">
was made to the Ju&s;tice of God; and the <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> of it to us in the Covenant of Grace, in which it is freely be&s;towed, and the meer mercy of God is celebrated. Whatever Chri&s;t hath done to merit it for us, we our &s;elves never did nor could do any thing towards the de&s;erving of it: So that our prayers cannot, of their own nature, oblige God to pardon us: and therefore we are, in them to confe&s;s our own <HI>unworthine&s;s</HI> of it, <HI>Luk</HI> 15.21.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence all the</HI> media <HI>by which we come to obtain any favour from him, are his free gift.</HI> He hath pre&s;cribed them, as an order in which we are to come by his benefits: yet, not only the benefits them&s;elves, but al&s;o all the grace and help where|by we are enabled &s;o to wait upon him for them is from him. He gives <HI>Repentance,</HI> as well as <HI>Re|mi&s;&s;ion, Acts</HI> 5.31. He <HI>helps us to pray,</HI> as well as pardoneth us on prayer, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.26. So that his Grace doth equally appear in the one as in the o|ther. So that though he hath made promi&s;es to &s;uch conditions, yet he mu&s;t give them, or we can never work them in our &s;elves.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>That Faith in Chri&s;t is the great</HI> medium <HI>by which we apprehend Gods forgivene&s;s.</HI> We cannot me it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, all that we have to do, is to receive it, which is only by an hand of Faith. Hence Ju&s;ti|fication, to which pardon belongs is in the Go&s;pel re&s;trained to <HI>believing, Rom.</HI> 5.1. But this hath been already in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That our faith mu&s;t be acted on Chri&s;t for our apprehen&s;ion of this pardon.</HI> I here di&s;pute not,
<PB N="291" REF="000965_0290_0FAE38EEE9124070">
whether the <HI>habit of Faith</HI> doth not put us in a &s;afe &s;tate? We are here only con&s;idering the order of the <HI>Oeconomy</HI> of the Divine di&s;pen&s;ation to us. As to Gods dealing with Infants, it is dark to us: We can readily conceive them Subjects as well capable of the Sanctification of the Spirit, as of natural corruption: though how they &s;hould exert acts of faith and repentance, is beyond our con|jecture. But as to others, we know that the habits of Grace are infu&s;ed for action: and to believe in Chri&s;t for life is an act of the Soul, proceeding from &s;uch a principle, and not meerly the principle it &s;elf, though it pre&s;umes a power put into us, el&s;e we could not take hold on Chri&s;t. Now it is <HI>actual believing</HI> to which the Go&s;pel promi&s;e is made, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3 16. And therefore it is called a <HI>coming to him, Math.</HI> 11.28.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That this faith is mo&s;t &s;uitably expre&s;&s;ed in Prayer.</HI> That prayer is a duty of <HI>Natural wor&s;hip,</HI> the light of Nature, as well as the word of God, informeth us: that we &s;hould can, our wants to God in Prayer, appears from the nature of it; that all our Prayers are to be made in faith, we are a&s;&s;ured, becau&s;e &s;uch Prayers only is <HI>Effectual.</HI> We mu&s;t ask all in the Name of Chri&s;t; we have no other way of acce&s;s to God. Now forgivene&s;s is one of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> great wants&punc; and that to pray in faith for it is mo&s;t &s;ui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able, will appear, if we con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Herein we te&s;tify our &s;elf want of it.</HI> It is &s;ence of need that drives men to Prayer. All formalities without this feeling, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut idle &s;trains of comple|ment which God hath no regard for. And indeed
<PB N="292" REF="000965_0291_0FAE38F04380FCE8">
the end of Prayer is not to acquaint him with our nece&s;&s;ities, for <HI>He knows them before, Math</HI> 6.8. but to affect our &s;elves with them. God would have us know our need, that we may put the better va|lue on his kindne&s;s: it is therefore upon <HI>felt want</HI> that we are advi&s;ed to <HI>ask, Jam.</HI> 1 5.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We herein al&s;o acknowledge God to be the author of our forgivene&s;s.</HI> This he expecteth of us. It was one clau&s;e in his Prayer, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.9. <HI>To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivene&s;&s;es.</HI> And if we do not believe and acknowledge it to come from him, why do we ask it of him? and here is a dou|ble exerci&s;e of faith: we believe that he can for|give, and we believe that if ever we be forgiven, it mu&s;t come from him, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 130.4. <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.9. When we go no whither el&s;e but to him for it, we give him the glory of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We herein declare that he is a free Agent when he forgiveth us.</HI> The very asking a pardon, if &s;in|cere, implies that we acknowledge our Guilt; o|therwi&s;e we could not know what we want a par|don for. And when we &s;eek to have Guilt re|moved in way of a pardon, we &s;ignify by it, that we have no &s;ati&s;faction of our own to make for the offence, but it mu&s;t come from the benignity and compa&s;&s;ion of him whom we have offended. So that Gods free Grace is fully a&s;&s;erted in our Pray|ing for forgivene&s;s, and that it is at his liberty; it is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">efore asked in his <HI>Name, P&s;al.</HI> 25.11.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Hence this puts us into the be&s;t po&s;ture to receive it.</HI> God will magnify his mercy in pardoning our Sin, and what po&s;ture better becomes us to take it
<PB N="293" REF="000965_0292_0FAE38F0DFFDD1C0">
of him, than lying pro&s;trate at his feet, re&s;igning to his mercy, &s;en&s;ible of our own unworthine&s;s, Ju&s;tifying him in his &s;everity again&s;t us, imploring him to look upon us in tender pity? and all this belongs to the very frame of a right praying to God. God is mo&s;t honoured by taking us off from the ground, where we ly before him in our &s;hame; thus is the <HI>Prodigal</HI> repre&s;ented, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.21.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Hereby we te&s;tify what an high value we have for a pardon.</HI> God expects that we place a worthy e&s;teem on his benefits. Men that do not pray for pardon, &s;hew that they prize it not. It is a poor thing that is not worth asking: But when with earne&s;t Supplications, and undeniable reque&s;ts, we be&s;iege the throne of Grace, and will not let God alone till we have it, we &s;hew that we account it a glorious thing: and when we obtain it, we &s;hall be an&s;werably affected with it; and God will &s;o be glorifyed by our thanksgivings.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is the di&s;po&s;ition of every gracious Soul thus to pray.</HI> I do not mean that they are always actually engaged in it; they may &s;ometimes <HI>keep &s;ilence,</HI> as <HI>David, Ver&s;e</HI> 3. But that there is a principle in them di&s;po&s;ing to this, and will &s;ooner or later put them upon it: and there are the&s;e things that will make it clear.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Grace in a Beli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver, not only fits him for, but al&s;o enclines him to Univer&s;al Obedience.</HI> Grace is put into us as a principle of Obedience; now it is of the nature of every principle that it hath a ten|dency to the reaching of its end: and it is univer|&s;al Obedience that we were made for, and for
<PB N="294" REF="000965_0293_0FAE38F3EF437108">
which we are Sanctifyed by the Spirit: and the <HI>new Nature,</HI> is ever a&s;piring after new Obedience.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Godly men do often &s;tand in need of new forgivene&s;s.</HI> This hath already been con&s;idered. There is new provocation given to God by every folly that we labour of, and defile our Con&s;ciences wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hall; &amp; we are under an apprehen&s;ion of Guilt, till God hath forgiven us the&s;e &s;ins; nor can we have peace within, till we obtain this; <HI>ve&s;.</HI> 3, 4.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There are none that do &s;o re&s;ent the need of for|givene&s;s as the Godly when under Conviction.</HI> For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The anger of God is more terrible to them than to others.</HI> Others indeed may be more &s;lavi&s;hly afraid, but the&s;e have a more genuine fear of it, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119. 120. <HI>My fle&s;h trembleth for fear of thee.</HI> The mo&s;t genuine fear is <HI>filial,</HI> and that which is grounded in love. A gracious Soul valueth the <HI>Love of God more than life it &s;elf,</HI> &amp; therefore his anger is awful to him: he hath felt the bitterne&s;s of it, and that maketh him to dread it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence the apprehen&s;ion of Guilt is to him more in|tolerable.</HI> He knows it to be a <HI>Fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God, Heb</HI> 10 31. And when he finds Guilt upon his Con&s;cience, he knows that he lyeth expo&s;ed to Gods anger; and he can|not tell how to bear it, he cannot live under it, the weight of it &s;inks him; he can have <HI>no re&s;t</HI> &s;o long as it abideth on him, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 38 3.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence this directs him with greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s to &s;eek a pardon.</HI> The carnal man, when in trouble, hopeth to get ea&s;e &s;ome other way, and takes the cour&s;es which his vain heart dictates to him: but a

<P N="4">4. <HI>The&s;e have all helps and encouragements to prompt them to &s;eek and pray for a pardon.</HI> And this added to the former mu&s;t needs di&s;po&s;e them to it, for,</P>

But when we ask his mercy, and he be&s;tows it up|on us, we conclude that we have found him.

<P>Conclu. 2. <HI>That the opportunity of thus finding God is limited to time.</HI> There are two ages of man, or a double &s;tate to which he is appointed, with re|&s;pect to duration, <HI>viz Time</HI> and <HI>Eternity</HI>; the for|mer whereof is limited, the latter boundle&s;s; the one will quickly come to an end, the other never; and where the former ends, the other begins. <HI>Time,</HI> in the general notion of it, <HI>is the boundary of the Creatures duration</HI>: and this may be con&s;idered generally with re&s;pect to the world, and &s;o it be|gins with the fir&s;t moment of the Creation, and &s;hall la&s;t till the con&s;ummation of all things, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Day of Judgment; and all this while God will be to be found by &s;ome: there will be a Day of <HI>Grace,</HI> the <HI>Mediators Kingdom,</HI> in which a
<PB N="310" REF="000965_0309_0FAE376AFA4ACE48">
treaty of Reconciliation is held up with man, will continue till the end: for it is with regard to the <HI>Elect</HI> that the World is continued, but when that ends, this will end with it; that will deter|mine the everla&s;ting &s;tate of all men unchangeably. But then there is a more particular con&s;ideration of time, as it re&s;pecteth the &s;everal Creatures which are the Subjects of it: and thus every Creature in the lower world hath its own time, or the bounds of its duration, which begins with its exi&s;tence, and ends with its di&s;&s;olution; thus <HI>David, P&s;al</HI> 31.15. <HI>My times are in thine hand.</HI> Only this difference is to be ob&s;erved between man, and other &s;ublunary beings, that when their time ends, and they are di&s;&s;olved, their exi&s;tence cea&s;eth for ever, being re&s;olved into their fir&s;t principles, never to return to their fir&s;t individual being: Whereas man, when by his di&s;&s;olution he cea&s;eth to be a Son of time, but enters upon his Eternity, in which he is to exi&s;t for ever: and though for a while his body mu&s;t be re&s;olved in|to du&s;t, yet it &s;hall return again by a <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> to its particular exi&s;tence; the Soul in the mean while retaining its e&s;&s;ence, faculties, &amp; activity. Now every mans particular time is the <HI>&s;pot that lieth between his birth and his death</HI>; it begins with his coming into the World, and la&s;ts till he goeth off the Stage, and there it ends; this is that to which his <HI>oppurtunity</HI> of &s;eeking and finding God is <HI>limi|ted.</HI> I do not &s;ay that it &s;hall la&s;t &s;o long with e|very one, but I am a&s;&s;ured that it &s;hall extend no further. When once this gla&s;s is run it &s;hall be

turned no more. For the Demon&s;tration of this, take the&s;e Conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That it is arbitrary with God whether ever be will be found by &s;inful man or no</HI> Man in his A|po&s;ta&s;y went away from God, <HI>bad him depart,</HI> pre|ferred other Objects before him, and renounced communion with him; how ju&s;tly might God upon this have rejected him for ever, and re&s;ol|ved that he &s;hould never more obtain his favour? He hath no dependance on his Creature; if he had &s;aid they &s;hall never &s;ee my face again for e|ver, he had offered them no injury at all. He therefore in this acts his Soveraignty: and it therein eminently appears, in that he thus mani|fe&s;teth him&s;elf when, where, and to whom he plea&s;eth; the greate&s;t number of mankind are groping in the dark, &s;eeking an object in which to find their happine&s;s, and God doth not &s;hew him&s;elf to them, than whom, they to whom he doth thus appear, are nothing better; &s;o that his meer good plea&s;ure is herein di&s;played; hence that of our Saviour, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.25, 26.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence it is at his liberty to fix the terms on which he will be found by them.</HI> If the thing it &s;elf be at his liberty, he mu&s;t needs then have the power of pre&s;cribing. Man is a Rebel and an Out law; if God will pur&s;ue him to death, and de&s;troy him, he doth him no wrong: and if he will indulge him with a treaty of reconciliation, it is at his di&s;|cretion to make the <HI>Articles</HI> of it. Now among the other terms of the treaty this is one, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;tating of the time wherein men may come in
<PB N="312" REF="000965_0311_0FAE376E8D29CBF8">
and find him. A Prince that proclaimeth peace to his Rebellious Subjects, may limit the day, and proclaim, that if they come in by &s;uch a day, and &s;ue for it, they &s;hall have it; but if they take not that opportunity, there &s;hall be no hope; and it is a very high favour that &s;uch an offer as this, though thus bounded, &s;hould be ever made to any of the race of &s;inful men.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>That except God reveals him&s;elf unto men, they may &s;eek, but they &s;hall not find him.</HI> There is &s;uch a thing as this, <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.28. And there is great rea&s;on for it. God indeed hath made our &s;eeking of him, the way to our finding him, &amp; made a graci|ous promi&s;e that <HI>they who truly &s;eek him &s;hall find him</HI>; but it is a promi&s;e of Grace, and indeed the rea&s;on why any do &s;eek &amp; not find him, is becau&s;e they do not &s;eek him as they ought. However, God manife&s;teth him&s;elf arbitrarily to men: we may be in the outward u&s;e of all the means of grace, and yet mi&s;s him, &amp; never meet him there: and it will be &s;o, unle&s;s he plea&s;e to come and manife&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That unle&s;s God giveth them his Spirit &amp; Grace, they will never &s;eek him &s;o as to find him.</HI> There is a <HI>&s;o &s;eeking him,</HI> as is ever crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, and brings us into his pre&s;ence, &s;uch as that, <HI>Jer.</HI> 29.13. All other is either <HI>hypocritical</HI> or <HI>legal,</HI> which is not acceptable to God. Now if any of the Children of men &s;o &s;eek him, they mu&s;t have the grace from him &s;o to do; it is a work of his Spirit, and till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e <HI>give them a new heart,</HI> they can|not &s;o do: there mu&s;t be his <HI>drawing,</HI> if ever there be their <HI>following.</HI> Now the drawing of
<PB N="313" REF="000965_0312_0FAE376EA5934EF8">
the Spirit is at his plea&s;ure: if he &s;ee meet to withold this grace from men, they will never &s;o &s;eek him, notwith&s;tanding all the calls and coun|&s;els, and warnings that can be given them; and he hath no nece&s;&s;ity lying upon him to be&s;tow this on them.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>There are certain means in and with which God reveals him&s;elf to men, &s;o as they may find him.</HI> As God is to be found, &s;o there is a way for it. Na|tural men that live without the Go&s;pel, can ne|ver find him in that condition; the meer <HI>light of nature</HI> will never lead any of mankind to God, or bring them to communion with him again: had not this been manife&s;ted in the Go&s;pel, it had never been known, and man mu&s;t have wandred in an endle&s;s maze of error, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.6. And it is in and with this Go&s;pel that God is plea&s;ed to &s;hew him&s;elf to the Souls of men, and therefore by &s;erious attendance thereon they are to &s;eek him. Where therefore the&s;e means are either not be&s;towed, or are taken from men, or they from them, now the opportunity mu&s;t needs cea&s;e with them.</P>
<P>I now proceed to make it appear, that if ever we find God, it mu&s;t be during the time of our life in this world; and from the premi&s;es there are the&s;e evidences for it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That God hath in his Word, limited the day of Grace to this life.</HI> The Word of God is that by which we are to acquaint our &s;elves with his will; and there we are a&s;&s;ured that <HI>the day of Grace is limited.</HI> When our Text &s;aith, <HI>they &s;hall pray in a

<P N="2">2. <HI>That the means and offers of Grace are only af|forded men during the time of this life.</HI> Whiles God is to be found, he affords men advantages of &s;eek|ing him, and the&s;e are the Go&s;pel &amp; Ordinances, in which his Spirit is wont to come and &s;trive.

<P N="2">2. <HI>It is a wonder of his mercy that &s;uch as the&s;e &s;hould find him at all&punc;</HI> It is rich Grace that he &s;hould once offer him&s;elf, and accept of tho&s;e that embrace that fir&s;t offer; this is a favour which none o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Fallen Angels &s;hare in.

<P><HI>Prop.</HI> 2. I &s;hould now have proceeded to the Second Propo&s;ition in the Doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That if we would &s;peed in our Prayers to God for forgivene&s;s, we mu&s;t take this time to &s;eek it in.</HI> But this hath &s;uper&s;eded in the Di&s;cour&s;e on the for|mer. That we all &s;tand in need of dayly forgive|ne&s;s, hath been before evidenced; and that if we hope to obtain it, we mu&s;t &s;eek it of God in the way of Prayer. It is not then a matter of indiffe|rency when we &s;o addre&s;s him; but we mu&s;t take the finding time to do it in. There are three Con|clu&s;ions which re&s;ult from the premi&s;es, which give us the confirmation of this Propo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That it is vain for any to pray for forgivene&s;s
<PB N="359" REF="000965_0358_0FAE3871606C2008">
after this life, who did not &s;eek and obtain it in this life.</HI> If this be the only finding time, needs mu&s;t it be &s;o: it is now that <HI>God and we are in the way,</HI> which our Saviour a&s;&s;ures us is the proper time for us to <HI>agree with him</HI> in, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.58, 59. We are given to under&s;tand that there will be &s;ome who will at la&s;t be importunate for admittance &amp; acceptance, but all in vain, <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.25, 26, 27. <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who is now ready to hear prayers, will then have no ear to lend to them, nor be any whit moved by loud entreaties.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Sinners may, in this life, put God off &s;o long, till he re&s;olves to have nothing more to do with them in way of &s;pecial favour.</HI> It is a truth, that <HI>at what time a &s;inner truly turns, God will &s;hew him mercy</HI>; but yet men may &s;in them&s;elves into de&s;ertion and de|reliction, &s;o that <HI>God will not give them repentance,</HI> and if &s;o, he will not afford them forgivene&s;s; for they are in&s;eparable, <HI>Acts</HI> 5 31.

<P N="3">3. <HI>That Gods own Children may, by mi&s;&s;ing the op|portunity, pray a long time before God will let them know that he hears them.</HI> God makes them tarry long before he pours the balm of comfort into their Souls.

<P><HI>A.</HI> This may be con&s;idered on a double ac|count.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There may be publick calamities great and &s;ore,

utmo&s;t by them: and all this notwith&s;tanding their renewed repentance, reiterated &s;upplicati|ons, and gracious an&s;wers obtained.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> There hath been no &s;mall occa&s;ion of &s;tum|bling on this account: God hath made great pro|mi&s;es concerning this; and though he hath &s;aid, he will correct them in ca&s;e of prevarication, yet he hath al&s;o &s;aid, that if they confe&s;s and pray, they &s;hall be pitied and relieved; and if they walk clo&s;e with him, they &s;hall greatly pro&s;per; and that after this they &s;hall be thus expo&s;ed, is an har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> chapter, &amp; carnal rea&s;on cries out, <HI>Where is the Pro|mi&s;e?</HI> Let us then clo&s;ely weigh this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. In re&s;pect of Publick Calamities, and their relation to them: Ob&s;erve two things,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Though God may hear them for them&s;elves, and forgive them, yet he may not forgive the Land they live in, and &s;o their being forgiven will have no in|fluence to keep off Publick Judgments.</HI> A people may be guilty, and God will not withold his hand; their per&s;onal repentance doth not remove the general impenitency, and they cannot <HI>&s;tand in the gap,</HI> to keep off the Wrath of God, or &s;top the breaking in of floods of mi&s;ery; and if the body of a people have corrupted their ways, and will not be reformed, it is righteous with God to bring the&s;e waters upon them, and &s;ometimes i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> comes to that, <HI>Jer.</HI> 15.1. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14.14.</P>
<P N="2">2. They may not only &s;ee the common ca|lamity,
<PB N="365" REF="000965_0364_0FAE3878638C3840">
but &s;mart by it, and that righteou&s;ly: and there are two rea&s;ons for this.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They are members of that body against which God hath a Controver&s;y.</HI> That there is an external Di&s;pen&s;ation of Gods Covenant, in treating with the body of a profe&s;&s;ing people <HI>collectively,</HI> is a great truth: on which account the whole are con|&s;idered as one, and Gods <HI>Temporary Providences</HI> are accommodated to them as &s;o: thus &s;ometimes the &s;in of <HI>one</HI> may bring Gods Judgments on the <HI>whole Congregation, Jo&s;h.</HI> 22.20. e&s;pecially when that one mans &s;ins are influential to debauch a whole people, as 2 King. 23.26, 27. compare, <HI>Chap.</HI> 21.11. And when good men &s;uffer on this account, it is their infelicity in &s;ome regard, but <HI>there is no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s with God,</HI> nor may they charge iniquity on him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Their very &s;ins which they have repented of, and have obtained forgivene&s;s for, may have given occa&s;ion for tho&s;e publick calamities.</HI> Such was <HI>Davids num|bring of the people,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24. <HI>begin. I&s;rael</HI> indeed had provoked Gods anger; however this act of <HI>Davids</HI> was introductory to the fearful <HI>Plague</HI> that followed; and yet he repented before the plague came, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 10. Nay, the Sins of Gods Children may defile a Land, and though they repent per|&s;onally, yet publick Guilt remains, as in the fore|cited Ca&s;e: <HI>David</HI> therefore takes it to him&s;elf, and deprecates it from the people, in <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 17.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In re&s;pect to the per&s;onal afflictions they meet with and tho&s;e very awful, after they are forgiven.</HI> And the con&s;i&s;tency of this with the Covenant promi&s;e
<PB N="366" REF="000965_0365_0FAE3878E0222688">
and fidelity may be con&s;idered: and here,</P>
<P N="1">1. Negatively: <HI>The&s;e afflictions are not properly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> puni&s;hments of tho&s;e Sins.</HI> If we take puni&s;hment for the execution of <HI>Vindictive Ju&s;tice,</HI> this is not to be attributed to that: we mu&s;t beware of their di&s;tinction, who &s;ay God forgives the Guilt, but not the puni&s;hment: Guilt is nothing el&s;e but an obligation to &s;uffer puni&s;hment, and if the Guilt be remitted, that obligation is taken off: there is no|thing legal on this account. God doth not &s;it up|on them as a Judge to condemn them, for he hath already pa&s;t an act of Grace upon them in pardon|ing them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Po&s;itively; <HI>God in all this hath an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and re&s;pect to the Covenant of Grace, under which he hath taken them.</HI> And how con&s;onant it is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> will be evident if we Con&s;ider;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God in the New Covenant hath declared that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> will cha&s;ten the</HI> bold Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of his Children. Their relation to the promi&s;es doth not &s;ecure them again&s;t this; and it would wrong them if it &s;hould, &s;ee how the Covenant runs on this account, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 89.30. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is one <HI>Article</HI> in the Covenant, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.6. <HI>He &s;courgeth every &s;on whom he receiveth.</HI> God will maintain a fathers authority over them, and u&s;e a fathers di&s;cretion in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God u&s;ually prepares his Children for this Correcti|on by bringing them to his foot, on which forgivene&s;s follows.</HI> This is not that they &s;hould e&s;cape the rod, but be fitted for it. A wi&s;e father fir&s;t rea&s;ons with his Child, &s;heweth him his folly, makes him to &s;ee his de&s;ert, and this puts him upon asking for|givene&s;s;
<PB N="367" REF="000965_0366_0FAE387DAC50A678">

<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence God doth it for their Spiritual advantage. Heb.</HI> 12.9, 10. That &s;in needs, not only to be for|given, but to be mortified in them: the furtherance of their holine&s;s calls for this di&s;pen&s;ation; thus they come to &s;ee more of the bitterne&s;s of their &s;in, and be made the more watchful again&s;t it. <HI>David</HI> on this &s;core acknowledgeth the goodne&s;s of his affliction, and Gods faithfulne&s;s in inflicting of it, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.71, 75.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>God doth it for the vindication of the honour of his own Name.</HI> There is a reproach they often bring upon the Name of God, and the Religion they profe&s;s: the world hath been &s;candalized by &s;uch &s;ins; and when God thus deals with them, mens mouths are &s;topt, they cannot &s;ay that he can allow any abominations in his own Children, hence that, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.14.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Yea he may exerci&s;e his people, after he hath for|given them, for their tryal.</HI> He may exerci&s;e their Graces, and make proof of them, and &s;o make them more fearful of &s;inning, and enable them to bring forth much more fruit to his prai&s;e.

<P><HI>USE. I. Learn hence what impenitent &s;inners may expect to find at Gods hand.</HI> When Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;uffered, he advi&s;ed to &s;uch an improvement of it, <HI>Luk.</HI> 23.31. <HI>If it be done thus in a green tree, what

<P N="2">2. <HI>Neither let it make you to conclude that this ve|ry Sin is not forgiven.</HI> You are ready to &s;ay, &s;ure|ly God is angry, el&s;e he would not follow me with &s;uch afflictions, &amp; if he had forgiven me, this <HI>anger had been turned away, and he pacified to me</HI>; herein you argue on a mi&s;taken principle.

<P N="2">2. <HI>How far they that have made him their hiding place, may &s;afely depend on him for this, and why they &s;hould &s;o do?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This will be cleared in the following Con|clu&s;ions</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God is certainly all that to his people that he hath commended him&s;elf to them to be in any title of his.</HI> He could not be known to his people, did he not a&s;&s;ume &s;uch things to him; <HI>&amp; it is but a little portion of him that we know</HI> by them. God is all perfecti|ons in one undivided e&s;&s;ence, but we cannot di&s;|cover the&s;e perfections but &s;everally; and that he may reveal him&s;elf to us as an Object of tru&s;t, he hath a&s;&s;umed &s;uch <HI>Attributes</HI> as are &s;uited to our under&s;tandings, in which he reveals nothing to us, but what he really is, and what he will be to his people. As he is their God in Covenant, &s;o here|by he tells them what a God he will be to them in his Efficiency.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>That the end of Gods di&s;covering him&s;elf to his people by &s;uch titles, is to give them advantage to take
<PB N="395" REF="000965_0394_0FAE389B4FC794D0">
hold of him thereby.</HI> God in his <HI>back parts</HI> is the object of his peoples faith, for <HI>none can &s;ee his face and live.</HI> We only have communion with him in his declarative Glory; and he hath made it his peoples duty to <HI>take hold of him, I&s;a.</HI> 64.7. And the way in which we may &s;o do, is in his precious <HI>Attributes,</HI> which are as &s;o many <HI>handles</HI> on which our faith may fa&s;ten. Hence we read of <HI>taking hold on his &s;trength, I&s;a.</HI> 27.5. It is therefore to en|courage this that he hath proclaimed his name in tho&s;e golden letters, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34.6.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence God will certainly make good every</HI> rela|tive title <HI>for all tho&s;e to whom he &s;tands &s;o related.</HI> When he makes him&s;elf over to them in the New-Covenant to be their portion, he giveth all that which he hath revealed of him&s;elf in his Word, to be theirs, <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.24. And he would never &s;o give him&s;elf to them, if he did unchangeably pur|po&s;e to be all that to them, which he hath entitu|led them unto, <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.6. For it was his own free unnece&s;&s;itated act: having therefore &s;o obliged him&s;elf, he will never go back, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 45.19. <HI>I &s;aid not to the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, &s;eek me in vain.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That the very end of an hiding place, is for pre|&s;ervation from trouble.</HI> When God a&s;&s;umes <HI>Meta|phorical titles</HI> to him&s;elf, it is that, by con&s;idering what of excellency there is in tho&s;e things, we may accordingly expect that from him which is &s;hadowed out by them. Now a place to hide one &s;elf in, is needful for none but tho&s;e that are expo|&s;ed to trouble, and the u&s;e of it is to defend us from the injury threatned to us thereby. We
<PB N="396" REF="000965_0395_0FAE389C582244B8">
are therefore from hence, to entertain &s;uch ap|prehen&s;ions of God, and believe him, to be &s;uch an one.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That a thing then only proves its title due to it, when it an&s;wers it</HI> And indeed, <HI>Metaphors,</HI> when they are u&s;ed concerning God, do but carry a dark and faint re&s;emblance of his perfections, for there is nothing in the creature that may be com|pared with him: we ought therefore to re&s;olve that the thing &s;hadowed by it, is in him after a glorious and unparallel'd manner. When God calls him&s;elf <HI>an hiding place,</HI> we may think of the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>munition of rocks,</HI> the be&s;t fortified <HI>strong holds,</HI> and the mo&s;t &s;ecret <HI>retiring places,</HI> and then conclude them all unworthy of the name, in com|pari&s;on of him; and if he were not thus, he would never &s;o &s;tile him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Hence God is &s;uch an Object to his people, as their faith may &s;afely thus rely upon.</HI> They need not be afraid to adventure into him as an hiding place, in the greate&s;t trouble. He is in him&s;elf all &s;uffi+cient for it; as to <HI>power,</HI> none can be too hard for him, <HI>Prov.</HI> 18.10. As to <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> all the policy of men and Devils cannot outwit him, <HI>Prov.</HI> 21.30. He therefore looks on, and <HI>laughs</HI> at all their cunning contrivances, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 2.4. And his <HI>promi&s;e</HI> hath made this over to them, &s;o that they may challenge a &s;pecial intere&s;t in it; he hath not only &s;aid, <HI>I am God,</HI> but <HI>I am thy God, I&s;a.</HI> 41.18. And his <HI>faithfulne&s;s</HI> hath &s;ecured the performance of all the promi&s;ed good to them. If he can, he will do it for them, <HI>his promi&s;es are yea and amen,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI>

<P N="7">7. <HI>Their believing dependance on him, is the only way for them to glorify him in troubles.</HI> They ought &s;o to do; and it is done only by a &s;uitable exer|ci&s;e of Grace, according to the condition they are in: and no grace can at &s;uch a time have a right exerci&s;e, without this dependance, doubting, fear|ing, de&s;ponding, fretting, fainting, in a time of trouble, is a di&s;honour done to God by his people: Whereas hoping, tru&s;ting in him, daring to adven|ture all upon his word and power, giveth him his acknowledgment; and this will keep them to du|ty in blacke&s;t times, <HI>Dan</HI> 3.16, 17.</P>

Now de&s;ire is rai&s;ed by the con&s;ideration of the goodne&s;s of the Object, and his want of it, and this is the &s;pring of all his endeavours to compa&s;s it; it will not let him ly &s;till, but pricks him for|ward to the u&s;e of means, <HI>Prov.</HI> 18.1.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That which encourageth to u&s;e the&s;e particular means, is hope by them to obtain the thing de&s;ired.</HI> De&s;ire puts men upon &s;eeking means, but that which fixeth them upon the&s;e cour&s;es rather than others, is an apprehen&s;ion of the &s;uitablene&s;s of them to the purpo&s;e, and the probability at lea&s;t of gaining the thing in the u&s;e of them: and this hope putteth life into endeavour: for if men did not expect &s;ucce&s;s in the undertaking, they would either not begin, or pre&s;ently tire and give out: and therefore <HI>hope deferred makes the heart to faint,
<PB N="406" REF="000965_0405_0FAE37793055C780">
Prov</HI> 13.12. And that which nouri&s;heth hope is a rational connexion between the means and the end</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence there mu&s;t be an end aimed at, which gives motion to this de&s;ire and hope. Philo&s;ophers</HI> had in vain placed the end among the cau&s;es, if it did not influence to the producing of the effect. This cau|&s;ality mu&s;t be referred to the end in inten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion, which is by the influence it hath on the Efficient to &s;et him on work: and in all Rational agents this is evident, that the&s;e two affections are thus excited; the means are not de&s;ired or hoped in for them|&s;elves, but for that which is aimed at by them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That faith teacheth a believer to make Gods glory his la&s;t end in all things.</HI> Fallen man is <HI>come &s;hort</HI> of this, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.23. And hence hath other ends in which he cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers; but the Grace of God hath taught men to return to their great end again. They now renounce their &s;inful ends, and regulate their &s;ubordinate ends: this is an univer&s;al le&s;&s;on that faith teacheth, <HI>to do all for the glory of God,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.31.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Hence every prayer of faith hath an eye to this in every petition.</HI> When we pray for any thing, we always propo&s;e to our &s;elves, what u&s;e to make of it when obtained; and according to this propo&s;al, &s;o are our prayers to be accounted &s;piritual or car|nal; we read of &s;ome, <HI>Jam.</HI> 4 3. and, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78.18. The&s;e were not prayers of faith, but dicta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es of the fle&s;h. When we rightly go to God for any thing, we carry that in our aim, that we may be able to <HI>honour him with it.</HI> Not but that in its place, we may have re&s;pect to our deliverance, or comfort,
<PB N="407" REF="000965_0406_0FAE377AB540FAF8">
but we re&s;t not here; but would have all for our better &s;erving God.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Hence the right exerci&s;e of faith in prayer, layes a foundation for this prai&s;e.</HI> There is a rea&s;on of our hope which our faith improves; and this makes way for the&s;e &s;ongs. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Faith hath an eye and re&s;pect to the power of God.</HI> This is the fir&s;t rea&s;on why we believe in God; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould we ever tru&s;t in him, if we did not ac|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nowledge that he can do that for us, which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ommit to him. God thus encouraged <HI>Abrahams</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.1. <HI>I am God Almighty</HI>; and when we believe that he and no other can, we give him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> honour of his Omnipotency, and &s;o are pre|pared to put a remark on this <HI>Attribute,</HI> and give him the glory of it, when he &s;hall have performed for us, &s;o they, <HI>Exod.</HI> 15.6, 7.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Faith applies it &s;elf to his free Grace, in &s;en&s;e of our own unworthine&s;s.</HI> It teacheth us to come humbly, and to acknowledge that we de&s;erve no help, but the contrary, and accordingly to <HI>hope in his mercy,</HI> thus <HI>Jacob, Gen.</HI> 32 10. And the Pro|phet, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.8, 9. And as this helps again&s;t de|&s;pondencies from &s;en&s;e of our own unworthine&s;s, &s;o it di&s;po&s;eth us to celebrate the riches of mercy, appearing in the&s;e &s;alvations, and to &s;tudy how to <HI>render</HI> according thereto, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 116.12.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence faith concludes that if God will deliver us, we &s;hall be laid under &s;trong obligations to him by it.</HI> Certainly kindne&s;s done for us will bring us under bonds of gratitude, and &s;o the more that is re&s;ent|ed, the &s;tronger hold it will have of us. This
<PB N="408" REF="000965_0407_0FAE377B66C52BC0">
&s;en&s;e therefore will di&s;po&s;e us to pay our Te&s;timo|nies of gratitude to our benefactor: and all in|gratitude proceeds either from in&s;en&s;iblene&s;s or forgetfulne&s;s of this.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>This makes him to bring him&s;elf under obligati|ons.</HI> A Child of God never puts up a petition to him, but either expre&s;&s;eth or &s;uppo&s;eth a promi&s;e made to him, in ca&s;e he an&s;wers him: for all tran&s;|actions between God and his people&punc; are in a Co|venant way. Sometimes they bind them&s;elves by a <HI>vow,</HI> as <HI>Jacob, Gen.</HI> 28.20. or <HI>explicit promi&s;e,</HI> as <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 80.18&punc; And it is ever implied according to the method of the Covenant expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 50.15.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>His hope excites in him a premeditation what to do.</HI> Hope looks out for God to come in this way, and makes him to think, if or when God an&s;wers my reque&s;ts, how &s;hall I be&s;t &s;how my &s;elf grateful to him in it? hence a promi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iven, made them turn a fa&s;t into a thank&s;giving, <HI>Chron.</HI> 20.18, 19.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>And this puts him upon a preparation for the work before hand.</HI> He counts it his concern, and therefore addre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf to make ready; that he may have nothing to do, but put it in executi|on, when the time comes, P&s;al. 65.1. <HI>Prai&s;e wai|teth for thee, O God, in Zion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE I We have here a</HI> Rule <HI>for</HI> Trial, <HI>whether we offer right prayers to God in a time of trouble.</HI> Many pray, and complain they cannot be heard; and if they &s;hould enqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, might here &s;ee the rea|&s;on of it: there are things that men reckon for prayers, which God receives not as &s;uch.

<P N="1">1. <HI>It fills the heart with an ardent de&s;ire to glorifie God.</HI> All the literal <HI>Light</HI> that men get by &s;tudy, hath no <HI>heat</HI> in it; it doth not engage the heart at all in love to God; but when once the Soul hath <HI>tasted that God is gracious,</HI> hath felt the bitter|ne&s;s of &s;in, and been di&s;tre&s;t by rea&s;on of the wrath of God, and known the Grace of God in giving him Repentance and pardon; he is now filled with love to God, and thinks he can never do enough for him, never lay him&s;elf low enough,

<HEAD>Particular Application, the be&s;t way of teaching. DOCTRINE II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE be&s;t teaching is, when particular application is made of the truths that are taught</HI> The <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> is not content to lay down the general Doctrine of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and confirm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with his own experi|ence, but proceeds to in&s;truct men how they may come by it, and offer them help to direct them, and that particularly and per&s;onally. Here are two Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Prop. 1. <HI>That for the profitable teaching of Go&s;pel truths, there mu&s;t be application made of them</HI>: And here we may con&s;ider the nature, and the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of this application.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Touching the nature of it, it is properly a making u&s;e of the&s;e truths for helping a Chri&s;tians practice.</HI> But more particularly, there are two general parts of teaching: <HI>viz. Doctrinal</HI> and <HI>Applicatory</HI> which are not to be confounded, but put into due &s;ubor|dination. The fir&s;t is <HI>Doctrinal,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting in lay|ing open the Truth, &s;o as the under&s;tanding may apprehend it, and be made to give its a&s;&s;ent to it; we mu&s;t have a conception and a conviction of it, and this mu&s;t go before application, being to prepare for it: and therefore to fall to appli|cation before the truth be explained, and pro|ved,
<PB N="424" REF="000965_0423_0FAE37F6669745C0">
is to make confu&s;ion. The &s;econd is <HI>Applica|tory,</HI> which takes the Truth &s;o laid open and im|proves it for our benefit in the Service of God; and this hath to do.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>With the practical understanding.</HI> For, be&s;ides that the under&s;tanding is to be u&s;ed for di&s;cern|ing the Truth commended to us, it is al&s;o to be improved in judging of the goodne&s;s of the Truth &s;o exhibited, and accordingly commend it to the will for practice: this is made by <HI>Information,</HI> or drawing practical inferences from the general truth, which are for our <HI>In&s;truction</HI>; and this im|provement may be made of every Go&s;pel Truth.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>With the</HI> Will <HI>and</HI> Affections; <HI>for goodne&s;s is the proper object of the will, which exerts it &s;elf by the affections.</HI> And here Application &s;erves to <HI>Reprove</HI> us for our neglects, by convincing us of them, and &s;hewing the &s;in and danger in them, and rou&s;ing us to reform what is ami&s;s. Hence there are u&s;es of <HI>Conviction</HI> and <HI>Reprehen&s;ion.</HI> It &s;erves al&s;o to guide us to the right doing of Duty, and keeps us from turning a&s;ide. To <HI>Direct, quicken,</HI> and <HI>encou|rage us</HI>; and finally to <HI>corroborate</HI> and <HI>animate</HI> us in our Serving of God, and hence <HI>Con&s;olation</HI> is hither to be referred: and we &s;hall find all the&s;e in the Word of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That &s;uch Application is nece&s;&s;ary to be u&s;ed by &s;uch as teach others</HI>; this will appear in the&s;e Con|clu&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That all the truths of the Christian Religion are</HI> Practical. The de&s;ign of it is to <HI>teach men to live to God</HI>; and &s;o every <HI>Rule</HI> of it is a <HI>Rule of life</HI>;
<PB N="425" REF="000965_0424_0FAE37F724160598">
this being the end of the Go&s;pel, every part of it mu&s;t lead hereunto. We have the de&s;ign of it &s;et forth, <HI>Tit</HI> 2.11, 12. <HI>Mans great end is to glorify God</HI>; he mu&s;t have a <HI>Rule</HI> to direct him how to do it; and this is the <HI>Christian Religion</HI>; and that con&s;i&s;ts in practice; all the <HI>Theory</HI> of Divinity leads to <HI>practice.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence Chri&s;tians are no further profited by the&s;e Truths, than as they apply them to practice.</HI> That they may &s;o do, they mu&s;t know them: and its vain for men to pretend that though they know le&s;s than others, yet they live as well; for <HI>without knowledge the mind cannot be good</HI>; but on the other hand, if men only &s;tudy to know that they may talk, and be admired by their neighbours for men of under&s;tanding, but lead a loo&s;e and ungirt life, they deceive them&s;elves, and their knowledge will aggravate their Guilt, and procure them the more wrath, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.47. Hence that, <HI>Joh.</HI> 13.17.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence it is certainly the duty of every one that hears the Go&s;pel, to apply the truths of it to him&s;elf.</HI> It is not enough for us to receive them into our heads, but we mu&s;t <HI>let them &s;ink into our hearts</HI>; there are many &s;orts of hearers, but there is but one of them that get good by hearing, compared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o <HI>good ground,</HI> and the&s;e <HI>bear fruit, Mat.</HI> 13.23. And we have a <HI>profitable hearer</HI> de&s;cribed, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.25.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The end of teaching is to farther the end of the Go&s;pel, and that is practice.</HI> God appoints &s;ome to each others, becau&s;e he would have them Serve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> farther the Go&s;pel de&s;ign, if then that be ap|pointed
<PB N="426" REF="000965_0425_0FAE37F7EF595E50">
to lead and bring men to practice, they are to de&s;ign, and &s;eek how they may promov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it; hence they are &s;aid to <HI>Mini&s;ter the Go&s;pel&punc; Rom.</HI> 15.16.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That men need the help <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Application as much as of Doctrine.</HI> For, not only is our under&s;tanding <HI>dark,</HI> and for that end needeth Illumination; <HI>erro|nious,</HI> and therefore needs to be better informed; but our hearts al&s;o are <HI>corrupt,</HI> our wills <HI>dead,</HI> and our affections <HI>di&s;ordered</HI>; yea, and our practical under&s;tanding is indi&s;po&s;ed to draw particular in|ferences from general truths; &s;o that the&s;e need to be rou&s;ed, quickned and drawn to their work&punc; there is an indi&s;po&s;ition in all the parts, and they need to be excited: the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> thought it nece&s;&s;a|ry to inculcate known truths, for this end, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.12&punc; 17.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Hence the Word of God is &s;uited for this end.</HI> God hath not only delivered the <HI>Rule</HI> of Religion in genera] precepts, as men u&s;e to do in the <HI>Sy&s;tems</HI> of other <HI>Arts,</HI> but hath accommodated the Scrip|tures to the ends of practical Holine&s;s, and we are told the u&s;efulne&s;s of them, 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 3.16, 17 The perfection there intended, con&s;i&s;ts in an univer&s;al re&s;pect to the will of God, and conforming of the life according thereto, this was it that <HI>David</HI> gain|ed by the Word of God, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19.11.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Hence this was the cour&s;e taken by Gods Servants in Scripture record.</HI> We &s;hall find in all <HI>Pauls Epi|&s;tles,</HI> that though he begin with matters <HI>Doctrinal,</HI> yet he ever de&s;cends to things <HI>practical</HI>&punc; we find that after the <HI>reading the Law</HI> in the <HI>Synagogues,</HI>
<PB N="427" REF="000965_0426_0FAE37FB2057F3F8">
there was a <HI>word of Exhortation, Acts</HI> 13.15. And Chri&s;t him&s;elf took this cour&s;e, <HI>Luk.</HI> 4.20, 21. And &s;uch direction <HI>Paul</HI> gave to <HI>Timothy,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. <HI>begin.</HI> Thus only are men like to be profitable Teachers.</P>
<P>Prop. 2. <HI>That this Application mu&s;t be particular: and that with re&s;pect to the</HI> matter <HI>that is to be ap|plied, and the</HI> &s;ubject <HI>to whom the application is made.</HI> I will teach thee, <HI>&amp;c. In the &s;ingular</HI>: For a right taking of this up, let us ob&s;erve;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As to the ground of particular Application re|&s;pecting the matter, it follows from the former Propo&s;i|tion</HI>: For if all the Truths of Religion be for pra|ctice, then every truth ought to be &s;o applied: for <HI>none of the coun&s;el of God is to be &s;hunned, Acts</HI> 20.27. And con&s;equently all the Duties belong|ing to every part of that coun&s;el are to be urged; there is no duty, but Chri&s;tians are in hazard of forgetting or neglecting; and we &s;hall not be faithful to tho&s;e with whom we are concerned; if we neglect to &s;tir them up.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>As to application to particular per&s;ons</HI>: Though in private it is proper to apply things plainly and di&s;tinctly as <HI>Nathan</HI> did to <HI>David</HI>; and indeed the ground of private application is mainly for this end, that without reproaching mens per&s;ons open|ly, we may convince them of their particular &s;ins; yet in publick teaching care and prudence is to be ob&s;erved, le&s;t in&s;tead of doing them good, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rden them in &s;in; we &s;hould beware, le&s;t we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ive them occa&s;ion to think, it is not their &s;ins,
<PB N="428" REF="000965_0427_0FAE37FC6C711340">
but their per&s;ons we &s;eek to reproach. Here then ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If per&s;ons have been notoriou&s;ly &amp; &s;candalou&s;ly &s;inful, their &s;ins ought to be laid open, that they may a&s;hamed&punc; &amp; others warned.</HI> When their crimes are publick, and they impenitent, they are to be <HI>openly rebuked,</HI> and others advi&s;ed by their example, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.20.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is our duty to &s;peak to the whole, as if we &s;pake to every one per&s;onally.</HI> Our manner of appli|cation ought to be, as if we were talking with b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> one, and &s;o we are to call upon&punc; all to apply <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them&s;elves: holy men therefore on Scripture re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cord for the mo&s;t part apply precepts and warn|ings in the &s;ingular number: thus all the Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mands in the <HI>Decalogue</HI> are delivered; and innu|merable in&s;tances of like nature might be produ|ced.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>And we ought to apply Truths &s;o as tho&s;e that are &s;pecially concerned, may under&s;tand that God is now &s;peaking to them.</HI> Though we ought not to vilify men, or lay them open to the A&s;&s;embly, yet if we can wi&s;ely and clo&s;ely touch their Con|&s;ciences, and make them know that their &s;in is now te&s;tified again&s;t, it is very proper; hence in laying open duties and &s;ins very di&s;tinctly, we may come &s;o clo&s;e to men, that they verily be|lieve that &s;ome body hath been babling &s;omething again&s;t them, and acquainting us with &s;uch &s;ins of theirs, as we had not the lea&s;t intimation of: now the ground of this will appear, if we con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That we, in our</HI> Application, <HI>are but the In|&s;truments of the Spirit of God. Mini&s;terial Teach|ing</HI>

<P><HI>THe proper de&s;ign of all Divine Teaching, is to guide men into and in the way they ought to go.</HI> There are two Propo&s;itions here to be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Prop. 1. <HI>That there is a way in which all they mu&s;t go, that would obtain pardon, peace and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</HI> We may take notice of three things under this.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That there is a way to ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, out of which it cannot be obtained.</HI> This is evident; for,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Scriptures often mention the way under this con&s;ideration.</HI> Called the way of the <HI>Righteous, P&s;a.</HI> 1.6. Of <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Prov.</HI> 8 20.

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Word of God acquaints us with another way that leads to mi&s;ery, and that in contradi&s;tinction to

this</HI>; both are mentioned and characterized, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.13, 14. Called the <HI>way of the ungodly, P&s;al.</HI> 1.6. <HI>A fal&s;e way, P&s;al.</HI> 119.104. A way in which is <HI>de|&s;truction and mi&s;ery, Rom.</HI> 3.16. And many like titles; and by the&s;e we are acquainted that there is a right and a wrong.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence al&s;o the Scriptures declare men happy or mi&s;erable according to the way they are in&punc; P&s;al.</HI> 1. <HI>begin.</HI> 119. <HI>begin.

There mu&s;t then be a way for a man to come at felicity by, if he would not mi&s;s of it at la&s;t; and this will appear, if we con|&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That ble&s;&s;edne&s;s is an end, and &s;o there mu&s;t be a medium to it.</HI> All the de&s;ires and endeavours of the Rea&s;onable Creature are carried forth after happine&s;s; this they propo&s;e, and are in&s;atiably craving of, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 4.6. <HI>Who will &s;hew us good?</HI> And what&s;oever mea&s;ures men take, as their conceptions are variou&s;ly per&s;waded, this is it they would ob|tain.

<P N="2">2. <HI>That all men do not reach to be ble&s;&s;ed, and there mu&s;t be &s;ome rea&s;on for it.</HI> If all a&s;pire after it, and lay them&s;elves out for it, and yet but &s;ome are crowned with it, and others finally mi&s;s of it, they did not pro&s;ecute it alike, and hence that there is a bounded way to it; for if any way would do, why &s;hould any be fru&s;trated in the

<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence the promi&s;e is to be claimed only upon the performance of the Condition.</HI> For, though the pro|mi&s;e be firm, yet it is <HI>Relative:</HI> it &s;tands or falls according to the tenour of it; if we fail of doing that to which the promi&s;e is connected, God is faithful to his word, and there is no fal&s;hood in the promi&s;e, though we never receive the good of it; there is therefore expre&s;ly or implicitly con|tained a <HI>threatning</HI> with the promi&s;e, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 1.19, 20. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.13.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence this performance is the very way to enjoy the performance of the promi&s;e.</HI> It comes in as a ne|ce&s;&s;ary <HI>medium,</HI> which is <HI>Metaphorically</HI> called a <HI>way,</HI> becau&s;e we come to be happy, by our confor|mity to that which is required of us in order to it: and the want of this will make us to fail of that, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.16.</P>

<P N="4">4. <HI>The man cannot be happy unle&s;s he holds on in this way to the end, he mu&s;t keep in it, and not for|&s;ake it, but follow it.</HI> The Crown is hung up at the Goal, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e mu&s;t run to that, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.10.

with this difference, that the inward teaching, which is always effectual, is de&s;igned infallibly to lead men into the way, and never fail; whereas the outward is never thus effectual, but when it hath the conco|mitancy of the other; but yet the main de&s;ign of this al&s;o is for this end, &amp; it always obtains in the Elect, and is in order of means accommodated thereto.

<P N="1">1. <HI>What is that</HI> Contumacy <HI>under the means u&s;ed by God, which we are carefully to avoid?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We may here fir&s;t ob&s;erve &s;omething about the means them&s;elves, from whence we may the better judge of it. Now the means are the cour|&s;es that God takes to convince men of &s;in, and bring them to <HI>Repentance,</HI> in order to their being pardoned, and having the comfort of it; and there are two &s;orts of men to whom God thus applieth him&s;elf, <HI>viz Unregenerate</HI> Sinners, in or|der to their Conver&s;ion, and the <HI>Regenerate,</HI> when fallen into &s;uch &s;ins as make a breach between God and them; and the cour&s;es that God takes are ei|ther in his <HI>Ordinances</HI> or <HI>Providences.</HI> In his <HI>Ordi|nances</HI> he &s;ends Me&s;&s;ages to them, to &s;hew them their &s;ins, to convince them thereof, to reprove them, to di&s;cover their danger, and to call them to Repentance. In his <HI>Providences,</HI> e&s;pecially when the other do fail of the de&s;ired Efficacy, by &s;ome &s;ore afflictions that he brings on them, as a proper cha&s;ti&s;ement of their folly. Now men do &s;hew their Contumacy, when their corruptions do &s;o with&s;tand the means, as they remain impenitent under them: and this may be the ca&s;e, as of Sin|ners, &s;o of fallen Saints for a &s;ea&s;on; and is fitly expre&s;t by the carriage of the <HI>Hor&s;e and Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> to

them that would break them: and is di&s;covered by the&s;e things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When they cannot bear the means that are u&s;ed with them, but are enraged at them.</HI> If God &s;ends his Servants, and they rebuke them, and give them &s;erious warning, they fly out upon them, as if they had offered them the greate&s;t affront; thus they dealt by <HI>Jeremiah, Jer.</HI> 26.11.

Again, if God lays them under affliction, they murmur at his Providence, and fly in his face; thus <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did in the Wilderne&s;s; they behave them&s;elves as <HI>a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, Jer.</HI> 31.18.

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Duties required in the moral Law are all of them rational.</HI> The <HI>Moral</HI> Duties required are ei|ther <HI>Natural,</HI> or <HI>Po&s;itive.</HI> The f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rmer are called <HI>Natural,</HI> becau&s;e the light of nature teacheth them, and rea&s;on will convince Con&s;cience that they are right, &s;o as either to commend or accu&s;e them, ac|cording as they entertain them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.14, 15. The <HI>Po&s;itive</HI> are &s;uch as do add a particular re&s;triction to the law of nature, or are arbitrary commands built upon it: and the&s;e are accommodated to the be|nefit of man, and carry their rea&s;on in them; &s;uch as Gods limiting the <HI>Sabbath</HI> to a <HI>Seventh day, &amp;c.</HI> Meer <HI>Ethnicks</HI> have made excellent di&s;cour&s;es on many moral Duties, from the rea&s;on they &s;aw in them.</P>

That God will accept of man in this way, is wonderful conde&s;cention: but that in order to peace and &s;alvation, they turn from their &s;ins to God, and place their whole tru&s;t and reliance on Chri&s;t, is &s;o fair and convictive, that &s;inners who have refu&s;ed it, &s;hall have nothing to plead for them&s;elves in the day of accounts, <HI>Matth.</HI> 22.11. <HI>Joh.</HI> 15.22.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence it follows that all &s;in is unrea&s;onable.</HI> For the rea&s;ons of contraries are contrary: but &s;in is contrary to obedience, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.4. And further to &s;hew how unrea&s;onable &s;in is, ob&s;erve,</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>It is against his</HI> Sovereignty.

<P N="1">1. <HI>It</HI> defiles <HI>the man</HI>: it poy&s;ons him, it leaves him under that filthine&s;s which is indeed his bane: it leaves a blot upon him, which expo&s;eth him to reproach: Sin is therefore in Scripture compared to all tho&s;e <HI>filthy things</HI> that can be thought of, and all too little to &s;et forth its odiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It robs the man of his</HI> peace. There is <HI>great peace</HI> in Obedience, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.165. But &s;in lays a foundation for all di&s;turbance, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 57.20, 21. It makes deep wounds in the Con&s;cience, which will

<P N="3">3. <HI>It deprives him of his</HI> happine&s;s: and that both naturally, and upon the Covenant terms. Sin, if it gets into a man, is it &s;elf a mi&s;ery, and lays him o|pen to the wrath of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Hence it &s;ubjects him to all</HI> mi&s;ery. It brings all the cur&s;es written, on his head. The threatning runs in the&s;e terms, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.4. And all that is un|happy is contained in that word. It <HI>&s;eparates from God, I&s;a.</HI> 57.2. And what but mi&s;ery awaits thats &s;eparation?</P>

<P N="1">1. Here is matter of coun&s;el for Sinners;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Beware of confiding in your carnal rea&s;on: Vain man would be wi&s;e, &amp;c. Job</HI> 10.12. They who have the lea&s;t wi&s;dom, are mo&s;t conceited of them&s;elves and think they have the greate&s;t rea&s;on for what they do. Well, you are wi&s;e then, but let me tell you, <HI>the worlds wi&s;e men go wi&s;ely to hell.</HI> All their rea&s;onings for &s;in are bruti&s;h, and are counted wi&s;dom only by the fle&s;hly part.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Be then convinced of the folly that cleaves to you.</HI> God him&s;elf hath declared every unregenerate man to be a <HI>born fool,</HI> and gives this for the rea&s;on why

The fir&s;t le&s;&s;on that &s;inful man is to learn in wi&s;doms School, is <HI>that he him&s;elf is a fool</HI>; which, if any thing, will put him on enqui|ring after wi&s;dom. Many might have arrived at true wi&s;dom, but for a conceit they had that they were already wi&s;e. And if you will compare the &s;entiments of carnal rea&s;on&punc; with the dictates of the word of God, you mu&s;t either charge them with fooli&s;hne&s;s, or confe&s;s your wi&s;dom to be &s;o.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let this conviction drive you to God, to beg of him to re&s;tore you to your understanding again.</HI> The direction is, <HI>if any lack wi&s;dom, let him ask it of God Jam.</HI> 1.5. And who is there that doth not lack it&punc; but the exhortation is nextly to &s;uch whom the Spirit of God hath made to feel their want, and thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> made him &s;o earne&s;t on this account, <HI>Prov</HI> 30.2.3.</P>

Come then to this School, and humbly wait for his teaching, and &s;o may you arrive at that wi&s;dom which will make you happy; when the worlds wi&s;e man, and his wi&s;dom &s;hall peri&s;h to|gether.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>That there is &s;ome inward principle or motive ex|citing men to this Service, when they do attend it.</HI> All that pretend to Religion do not thus order their Conver&s;ation. Many that call them&s;elves Chri&s;ti|ans, live like <HI>Heathen,</HI> or wor&s;e, and &s;o bring re|proach on their Profe&s;&s;ion.

<P N="4">4. <HI>That men may be driven to this external &s;ervice by a principle of</HI> fear. There is a two fold <HI>fear</HI> mentioned in the word of God, one proceeds from the <HI>Spirit of Adoption,</HI> the other from a <HI>&s;pirit of bon|dage</HI>: the former of the&s;e is a <HI>filial fear,</HI> and pro|perly belongs to the Children of God; and is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to new obedience, that all Religion i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

frequently called by it; and it is proper to that love we owe to God, in as much as he is infinitely above us, and the genuine love of an inferiour to a &s;uperiour, involves a fear in it, <HI>viz.</HI> a reveren|tial re&s;pect, which makes us keep our di&s;tance, and to be very cautious of doing ought that may di&s;|plea&s;e, thus <HI>Jacob</HI> called God <HI>the fear of his father I&s;aac, Gen</HI> 31.53. The other fear ari&s;eth from a &s;ervile Spirit, under which all men, in their natural &s;tate, are in bondage: and though the Children of men do generally &s;uppre&s;s it, yet God, when he plea&s;eth, toucheth the Con&s;cience, and awakens it, and then terrours &s;ieze it, and the man is horribly afraid of the wrath of God. And becau&s;e, in this conviction, he is made to know that his &s;ins have expo&s;ed him to this wrath, and a&s;&s;ured him that if he live in them, they will bring him to de&s;tructi|on, it rou&s;eth him up, and &s;ets him on doing duty, and ab&s;taining from &s;in: but he doth not do this, becau&s;e he loveth obedience, and hate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;in, but becau&s;e his Con&s;cience terrifieth him, &amp; he dareth do no otherwi&s;e, and how many &s;uch in&s;tances are in Scripture? Hence that remark, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 78 34.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That Unregenerate and carnal Profe&s;&s;ors have none of this</HI> love <HI>in them, and are therefore acted by that</HI> fear. To love God, and to make a free choi&s;e of his &s;ervice, is a fruit of &s;pecial &s;aving Grace, and found in none but the Regenerate.

is &s;oon over, and they grow cold: or they Idolize the mercy, and forget the author: but this fear is the root of the carnal mans Obedience, <HI>I&s;a&middot;</HI> 33 14. Mo&s;t Hypocrites have an awakened Con&s;cience, and a legal &s;pirit attending it, which drives them to duty as a drudgery, and keeps them to it as a &s;evere ma&s;ter. Con&s;cience tells the man, there is hell and damnation, or there are terrible Judg|ments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and thus, like a dog, he dares not fall upon the thing that he would fain be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at, le&s;t he &s;hould be beaten for it. And indeed, by this fear God holds the command of mens Con&s;ciences, and by it, he in a great mea&s;ure governeth the world, and re&s;trains the unruly lu&s;ts of men from break|ing forth into that height of exorbitancy, which otherwi&s;e they would &s;oon ru&s;h into, if left without any bridle upon them, who&s;e <HI>heart is &s;et in them to do evil</HI>; and would carry them to the height that the greate&s;t mon&s;ters of men ever arrived at.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>That there is a mixture of the&s;e in Gods own Children; and their love is not always &s;o powerful, and &s;o they are &s;ometimes expo&s;ed to this fear.</HI> What is remarked in, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4 18. is not accompli&s;hed in this life; <HI>perfect love ca&s;teth out fear.</HI> The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t have &s;inful corruption remaining in them, &amp; that &s;ometimes &s;o prevalent, that it &s;uppre&s;&s;eth the vi|gorous exerci&s;e of Grace, and <HI>they are led captive by the law in their members</HI>: and, as God makes u&s;e of the <HI>Spirit of bondage</HI> in the Conver&s;ion of his E|lect, &s;o &s;ometimes he awakens it in believers, when they grow remi&s;s in their obedience: for, though they <HI>do not receive it again,</HI> yet, it not being wholly

taken away, it is &s;ometimes rou&s;ed in them. They have a rooted love of God, but the exerci&s;e is damped by &s;inful temptations, and God terrifies them, and makes his judgments to amaze them&punc; <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119 120. <HI>Job</HI> 31 23. How often doth <HI>David</HI> complain of <HI>terrours</HI> that affright him, of <HI>arrows that &s;tick in him, and drink up his &s;pirits</HI>? But there is difference between that in the Children of God, and in unregenerate men; in the&s;e they proceed no further, ri&s;e no higher; whereas in tho&s;e, they &s;erve to awa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n their love again, and revive their Graces: the&s;e fears help forward their Repentance.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>This fear hath a force in it, and will carry men no farther than it drives them.</HI> There is a va&s;t dif|ference between the motives that ari&s;e from this fear, and tho&s;e that proceed from love.

Love would always be wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h and plea&s;e its beloved.

Whereas fear alone, doth not take away that natural aver&s;ne&s;s that is in us to obe|dience&punc; it alters not our fal&s;e principles, but we &s;till <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all good evil,</HI> only it makes us apprehend the dan|ger ari&s;ing from the threatning, which we count unrea&s;onable, but becau&s;e we cannot otherwi&s;e a|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oid the threatned mi&s;ery, we chu&s;e rather to

<P N="1">1. <HI>It &s;aith at lea&s;t that there is a great power of in|dwelling &s;in in them.</HI> This is the be&s;t interpretation that can be put on it.

<P N="1">1 <HI>Learn hence a rea&s;on why a Profe&s;&s;ing People meet with &s;o many Judicial Providences.</HI> We are apt to wonder how it comes; but let us ob&s;erve;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Very often the bigger part of &s;uch a people are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arnal.</HI> It is our Saviours remark, <HI>Mat.</HI> 20.16. <HI>Many are called, but few cho&s;en.</HI> And &s;ee <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.28.9.5.

<P N="2">2. <HI>The best among them are too much carnal.</HI> Though not altogether fle&s;h, yet they carry too much fle&s;h about them; the Children of God have a rebellious party in them, <HI>Paul</HI> complains of it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.23, 24. And this corruption in them is unruly, and too hard for them, which occa&s;ion|eth their growing into &s;piritual indi&s;po&s;itions, which are <HI>attended with neglect of duty, and &s;ometimes woful prevarications.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence they cannot be long without affliction.</HI> A long continued &s;tate of pro&s;perity would do them hurt; the corruption in them will take advantage to draw them into carnal &s;ecurity, and &s;inful de|partures from God. Let ungodly men have their hearts de&s;ire, and they will abu&s;e it; and Gods Children cannot bear too much dandling in the lap of Providence: <HI>if Davids mountain stand &s;trong,</HI> he grows carele&s;s, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 30.5. Such a people therefore would gather abundance of filth to them&s;elves, as the Sea doth in a calm.</P>

him&s;elf to be in all his declared perfections to believe the truth of his commands, of his promi|&s;es and threatnings.

There is then a <HI>Faith in God</HI> which is requi|red in the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> of all tho&s;e that enter|tain it, and hope to receive the benefits of it; and this faith is to be placed in God through Chri&s;t; and though <HI>God,</HI> or the <HI>Divine nature,</HI> be the <HI>Ulti|mate object</HI> of it, yet <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and <HI>immedi|ate object,</HI> through whom we are to come to and believe in God; whence it is mo&s;t frequently in the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> called believing in Chri&s;t.

<P><HI>A.</HI> This is contained in two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The mercy that thus Compa&s;&s;eth them hath all in it that is needful to make them perfectly ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> There is nothing wanting either for the way or for the end.

This will give them <HI>Victory</HI> in their Warfare, make them bold <HI>in the fight, renew their &s;trength</HI> when they faint, hold them up when ready to fall, bring them &s;afe through an evil world, and pre&s;ent them before Chri&s;t, and lodge them in his everla&s;ting arms: and what more can be de&s;ired to denominate the man ble&s;&s;ed, than to be under &s;uch <HI>&s;afe conduct</HI>?</P>

<P N="1">1. The Subjects of the Exhortation, ex|pre&s;&s;ed in two words.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Righteous</HI>: the word &s;ignifieth one that is ju&s;t, whether habitually or actually; and is fre|quently u&s;ed for one that is &s;o in <HI>Law</HI>; he is a righteous man, whom the Law upon trial declares to be &s;o; this title is in this regard given to every Ju&s;tified per&s;on, whether he be &s;o on account of his per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s, or that of another im|puted to him, for, let the man have been never &s;o unju&s;t in him&s;elf, yet if anothers righteou&s;ne&s;s be accepted for, and imputed to him, he is ju&s;t in a Law re&s;pect; and thus it is here to be taken, for it points to the &s;ame man who is de&s;cribed, in <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 1, 2.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The upright in heart.</HI> This expre&s;&s;ion is not <HI>Synonimical</HI> of the former, but points at &s;omething el&s;e in the Subject; that had a re&s;pect to Ju&s;tifi|cation, this to Sanctification, and points to the in|&s;eparablene&s;s of them. The word comes of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oot that &s;ignifies, to <HI>go &s;trait,</HI> or <HI>regularly,</HI> and is
<PB N="584" REF="000965_0583_0FAE37DE606D8768">
u&s;ed in the Word of God to denote <HI>&s;incerity.</HI> By uprightne&s;s of heart we are to under&s;tand that there is a principle of integrity in him, and that his cordial aim is to go &s;trait in his whole Conver|&s;ation: though through infirmity, he may come &s;hort in act, yet his heart is right: &s;o that <HI>upright|ne&s;s</HI> is not oppo&s;ed to <HI>infirmity,</HI> but to <HI>hypocri&s;ie,</HI> el&s;e it would be a title that none in this life could challenge.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Exhortation</HI> it &s;elf, which is in &s;umme, to <HI>rejoyce,</HI> but it is emphatically &s;et forth by a tri|plication of the advice in a variation of words; pointing us to,</P>
<P N="1">1. The great weight there is in this duty; re|petition of things is a note of earne&s;tne&s;s; God expects that all &s;uch rejoyce, and will be di&s;plea|&s;ed if they do not.</P>
<P N="2">2. The con&s;tancy of this duty, when he bids them to rejoyce again and again, and a third time, it &s;aith that they &s;hould always rejoyce; and the variation of words points us to the manner and mea&s;ure of our joy. <HI>Be glad</HI>; it &s;ignifies, to be chearful or merry, pointing to the inward affecti|on, and outward expre&s;&s;ion of it, but mainly the former: <HI>Rejoyce,</HI> the word &s;ignifies the expre&s;&s;ion of inward gladne&s;s by outward ge&s;tures, and is rendred by the <HI>Septuagint,</HI> by a word that &s;ignifies to leap or dance for joy. <HI>Shout for joy</HI>: the word is u&s;ed for the highe&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of joy that can be, it &s;ignifies to cry vehemently, and is u&s;ed equi|vocally for joy and &s;orrow, but mo&s;tly the former.

We may then here enquire,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Who the&s;e Righteous Ones are?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In a word, they are all who&s;e &s;ins are <HI>par|doned,</HI> and who&s;e per&s;ons are <HI>Ju&s;tified.</HI> The word of God doth frequently put this title upon men, with a proper re&s;pect to their pardoned and Ju&s;ti|fied &s;tate. There are many men, who, in the Word of God, are called Righteous: this title can be truly a&s;cribed to none on a Law account, with re&s;pect to a perfect inherent Righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own, excepting the man Chri&s;t, who is for that rea&s;on re&s;treinedly called, <HI>the Righteous,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh</HI> 2.1. Becau&s;e there is none el&s;e without &s;in.

<P N="1">1. <HI>What is the Uprightne&s;s of heart here intended?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We ob&s;erved, that it points to <HI>Sincerity</HI> as op|po&s;ed to <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI>: and it refers to the new nature which is put into us in Regeneration, by which our whole Soul is wrought to a conformity to the will of God; called <HI>truth in the inward parts, P&s;al.</HI> 51.6.

<P N="4">4 <HI>That Faith by which we receive the&s;e benefits, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Grace of the Spirit in us.</HI> As God gives Chri&s;t to us, &s;o we are to receive him in order to his being ours: Now the hand by which this is done, is

<P N="1">1. <HI>It is proper to the</HI> Affections <HI>to be moved by the object.</HI> They are powers put into the Creature, &amp; being powers, there mu&s;t be &s;omething to bring them into act; and this is by way of excitation; and that which &s;o excites them, is the Object that is before them; &s;o that when they have no object to move them, they have no motion.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence the motion of the Affections is according to the apprehen&s;ion had of the Object.</HI> Now this appre|hen&s;ion is either by the exerci&s;e of the <HI>&s;en&s;es,</HI> as in bruits, or of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> as in man: for though the &s;en&s;es in man are helpful in the di&s;covery of things, yet they are &s;ub&s;ervient to his rea&s;on; which hath in him the power of judging and de|termining of things: that therefore which moves the affections is either the <HI>good</HI> or <HI>evil</HI> in the Object; but not meerly as it is in it, but as the man apprehends it &s;o to be; and &s;o they may be led by mi&s;take, through a fal&s;e opinion to call <HI>good evil, and evil good,</HI> &amp; act accordingly <HI>I&s;a</HI> 5 20.</P>
