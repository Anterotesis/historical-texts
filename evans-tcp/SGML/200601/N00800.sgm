Never|thele&s;s, in our fir&s;t and be&s;t Times, there were Tares and Chaff mixed with the Wheat. That there is now a great De+cay among&s;t Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion in this Land (would to God it were not &s;o among&s;t Profe&s;&s;ors of our way in the other <HI>England</HI> al&s;o) mu&s;t likewi&s;e be confe&s;&s;ed.

I remember, that ten years ago, that Excellent Per&s;on Dr. <HI>Walker,</HI> then Mini&s;ter at <HI>Alderman|bury</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> a&s;&s;ured me that in that Pari&s;h, there were a con&s;iderable Num|ber of Young per&s;ons, who often met together to Pray and Conferr about the things wherein their Souls were concern|ed, and that every month, in order to their more prepared Coming to the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> they &s;pent a Day in Pray|er together.

But it is appli|cable to all times of defection among Profe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI>; and may have re&s;pect to the la&s;t and wor&s;t times, pre|ceding the great <HI>Reformation</HI> which is expected, of which our Saviour, Luk. 18 8. <HI>When the Son of Man cometh, &s;hall he find Faith on the Earth?</HI> The word <HI>Peri|lous</HI> &s;ignifyeth, <HI>hard, difficult, mole&s;tful</HI>; and &s;uch times do expo&s;e men to danger, and are therefore <HI>Perilous.</HI> It intends, that it will be hard for a man to live

like a true Chri&s;tian, becau&s;e he will ex|po&s;e him&s;elf thereby.

<P N="2"><PB N="22" REF="000963_0021_0FADE47630857E58">2. What it is to deny the Power of Godline&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To make this clear, let us ob&s;erve;</P>
<P N="1">1. That the power of Godline&s;s com|prehends two things in it. The word <HI>power,</HI> u&s;ed in our <HI>Text,</HI> &s;ignifieth the <HI>vertue, efficacy,</HI> and <HI>force</HI> of a thing: and al&s;o the <HI>faculty</HI> or <HI>principle</HI> from which it proceeds. Hence, in the power of Godline&s;s there is contained.</P>
<P N="1">1. The inward principle of Sanctify|ing Grace; which is the root of God|line&s;s in a Chri&s;tian. The power of a thing con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>internal vertue</HI> that it hath in it: Now Grace is the very life of Godline&s;s; nor is any a Godly man, who hath not this Grace in him. God always regards the heart, and he knows it, and he will acknowledge no man to be Godly, but him who&s;e <HI>heart is right.</HI> That therefore was it which &s;poiled all their fair pretences, P&s;al. 78.37. <HI>their heart was not right with him.</HI> An Unregenerate man cannot be a Godly man, becau&s;e he hath no principle of Godline&s;s in him. He that is Godly, loves God, fears God, delights in his Law, hates &s;in, mourns for it, and re&s;t|le&s;ly
<PB N="23" REF="000963_0022_0FADE476D2A80BF8">
&s;eeks a deliverance from it. This is the very di&s;po&s;ition of that Grace which he receives from God, <HI>Tit.</HI> 2.11, 12.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Efficacy of this principle is in the exerci&s;e of a Godly life. This is <HI>Metonymically</HI> called <HI>Power,</HI> becau&s;e it is an effect flowing from it, and &s;o is a di&s;|covery of it: for by the actions the ha|bits are to be di&s;cerned, and judged of. Hence, according to the life of a Profe&s;|&s;or, accordingly is this power evidenced. And hence we read of weak Grace, and &s;trong Grace. When a Chri&s;tian liveth &s;o in the work of his Generation; as to Glorify God, in a zealous re&s;olute pur&s;u|ance of Holine&s;s, and with&s;tanding of Sin, in oppo&s;ition to all that would with|&s;tand or hinder him, or di&s;courage his pur&s;uit of it, he &s;hews this <HI>Power</HI>; and this power is oppo&s;ed to weakne&s;s or infirmity. <HI>Peter</HI> had faith, but he did not di&s;cover power in it, when he began to &s;ink, Mat. 14.32. <HI>O thou of little faith, why did&s;t thou doubt? Abraham</HI> had not only faith, but a powerful faith, <HI>when he believed in hope against hope,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.19, 20, 21. and both the&s;e re&s;pects may
<PB N="24" REF="000963_0023_0FADE4779413F038">
come under the con&s;ideration of the matter before us.</P>
<P N="2">2. A thing may be &s;aid to be denied in two re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">1. Verbally and profe&s;&s;edly: and that is the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t &s;ignification of the word; but it cannot be univer&s;ally &s;o under&s;tood here: for, for a man to profe&s;s the true Religion, and at the &s;ame time profe&s;&s;ed|ly to deny it, is a contradiction. Though it mu&s;t be granted, that a man may pro|fe&s;s a thing in the gro&s;s, and yet deny it in &s;ome of the main parts of it, as will appear in the &s;equel. But this is not all, nor yet the thing which is princi|pally here de&s;igned.</P>
<P N="2">2.

re&s;pects, in which we were told, the power of Godline&s;s con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P N="1">1. When men pretend to be Godly, &amp; yet by their lives, di&s;cover them&s;elves not to be &s;o; and this is a thing too fre|quent. There are indeed tho&s;e <HI>Hypocrites</HI> who deceive the People of God, and act Godline&s;s &s;o &s;peciou&s;ly, that they are not di&s;covered&punc; but there are others, who for all their &s;tickling and noi&s;e, do yet expre&s;s &s;uch vanity, and want of any favour of Piety in their lives, that give, at lea&s;t to di&s;cerning Chri&s;tians, if not to others, ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that <HI>the root of the matter</HI> is not in them: &s;uch an one was <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> unto whom <HI>Peter</HI> plumply &s;aith, Acts 8.23. <HI>I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterne&s;s, and bond of iniquity.</HI> He that no hath grace, cannot be &s;aid to have the power of it in him: &s;uch then as lead Unregenerate Lives, &s;ay that they are &s;uch, P&s;al. 36.1. <HI>The tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the wicked &s;aith in mine heart, there is no fear of God before his eyes</HI>; and yet &s;uch as the&s;e <HI>flatter them&s;elves</HI>; ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e 2.</P>
<P N="2">2. When men make a great &s;tir about

Godline&s;s, and yet there is very little of the life of it appeareth in their Conver|&s;ation. The&s;e do not proceed &s;o far as the other in di&s;covering them&s;elves; they do &s;omething in pro&s;ecution of their profe&s;&s;ion, and Godly men have charitable hopes concerning them; but yet they are rather <HI>Negative</HI> than <HI>Po&s;itive,</HI> becau&s;e they act &s;o faintly and irre&s;oulte|ly in all they do. If there be the <HI>root of the matter</HI> in them, yet the activity of it is very little: a &s;mall temptation allureth them, a little oppo&s;ition di&s;hear|teneth them; they give too much &s;cope to them&s;elves in things which they plead a liberty for; and every trial is ready to lay them open, and di&s;cover their irre&s;o|lution: whereas, if Piety were powerful in them, it would not be &s;o. Now it is the former of the&s;e which our Text more immediately and directly aimeth at, however we need not to exclude the latter; and here we may take a more di&s;tinct account of tho&s;e things wherein this ill &s;tate or frame of Profe&s;&s;ors doth appear, for our help to judge of our &s;elves, and of the times we live in.</P>
<P>There are then the&s;e things which are
<PB N="27" REF="000963_0026_0FADE52597CE2D60">
the <HI>&s;ymptoms</HI> of mens denying the power of Godline&s;s, though they make never &s;o fair a profe&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. When, though men make never &s;o fair a profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Religi|on in general, yet they deny or reject &s;ome of the main Articles of it. A &s;ound belief of the <HI>Evangelical</HI> Truths, nece&s;&s;a|rily belongeth to <HI>Godline&s;s</HI>: and though there is no Theological Truth, but is of great weight, and the denial of it is &s;o far a coming &s;hort; yet there are &s;ome that are &s;o E&s;&s;ential to Piety, that the denial of them undermines the very foundation of Chri&s;tianity, and puts men off from the very foundation on which it is built; and yet there are tho&s;e who glory in the name of Chri&s;tians, and would be reckoned among the be&s;t, who hold &s;uch unhappy tenents as prove them to be none. The Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of <HI>another Go&s;pel,</HI> which yet he tells us <HI>is not an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther,</HI> but only a <HI>perverting of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> Gal 1 6, 7. and he re|fers it to tho&s;e th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t would bring in the Law over the head of Chri&s;t.

<PB N="28" REF="000963_0027_0FADE526E1DAFA18">
and all true Godline&s;s derives from him. <HI>Faith</HI> belongs to Godline&s;s, both as the ground of our hope for Salvation by Chri&s;t, and as the root of our acceptable Obedience to him; we are therefore told, Heb. 11.6&punc; <HI>Without faith it is im|po&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God.

of it, we may be &s;atisfyed in the rea&s;on of this. I confe&s;s, it is hard to cen&s;ure Gods Children individually, or per&s;onally for the afflictions which they meet with in their particular Con|cerns; for the de&s;ign of the&s;e is very often for their trial; &s;uch were <HI>Jobs,</HI> and yet they were very &s;harp and &s;ore: it would therefore be very inju|rious to charge them as Hypocrites on this account. But, when God brings &s;ore and wa&s;ting Calamities of Sickne&s;s, Famine, and War, on a profe&s;&s;ing peo|ple, and they are wa&s;ted and brought low by them, we are, according to the whole tenour of the Scriptures, to allot this to the anger of God; and God is not angry without a cau&s;e, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.4. <HI>Will a Lion roar in the forre&s;t, when he hath no prey</HI>?

It is true, the Symptoms of the Times are of two &s;orts, <HI>viz. Natural,</HI> which are to be read in the order and po&s;ture of &s;econd cau&s;es, for, though there be a <HI>contingency</HI> belonging to the&s;e things, yet there is a natural <HI>eonnexion</HI> be|tween &s;uch cau&s;es, and &s;uch effects, which in the ordinary cour&s;e of Providence will be produced, unle&s;s they be &s;ome way over-ruled and prevented.

<P N="2">2. It many ways concerns every one of us to know the peril of the times that we live in. Nor indeed can we do well without it, for,</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a &s;pecial <HI>Generation work</HI> lying upon every Chri&s;tian, according as the times are. It is true, every Child of God ought to endeavour to do the whole will of God, and to neglect no known duty at any time; we owe our whole life to his Glory, and in this re|&s;pect all times are alike to us: but &s;till as the times change, the &s;pecial and more peculiar deportments required
<PB N="81" REF="000963_0080_0FADE55B918C8DC0">
of Chri&s;tians do change with them; and hence there is one thing which is the work of one Generation, and &s;omething el&s;e the work of another. It is ob&s;er|vable, that God commends <HI>Noah</HI> with this remark, Gen 7.1&punc; <HI>thee have I &s;een righte|ous before me in this Generation.</HI> Which in part at lea&s;t, intends that he had Served him according to the pre&s;ent condition of the Generation he lived in. Hence it is &s;aid of <HI>David,</HI> Acts 13.36. <HI>that he Served his own Generation by the will of God</HI>; and it is certain, that there was one work for <HI>David,</HI> to do in his time, and another for <HI>Solomon</HI> to do in his.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is every ones duty in his place, to <HI>thru&s;t into the gap,</HI> that he may keep off the evil threatned. When there are fad <HI>Progno&s;ticks</HI> of the times; when the Clouds begin to gather apace, and mi&s;|chief apparently impends over a pro|fe&s;&s;ing people; when Gods anger is in|kindled again&s;t them, and &s;in hath o|pened a wide gap for it to come in, and evil begins to croud in at it, all that fear God &s;hould endeavour to plea&s;e God, to pacifie his anger, and prevent

<P N="3">3. They are the &s;ins of the times that make them peculiarly perilous. The great danger that a people are expo&s;ed to, is from the anger of God which is kindled upon them: if he be plea&s;ed with them, they are &s;afe, nor need they to be afraid of the threatning of the world; they have <HI>the name of God to run into, and that is a &s;trong tower, Prov.</HI> 18.10. But if God be di&s;plea&s;ed at them, and his wrath begins to wax hot, they now ly open to every mi&s;chief; their defence for&s;akes them, and every evil will make a prey of them. Now, if God be di&s;plea&s;ed at a people, Sin always is the procuring cau&s;e of it: he taketh plea&s;ure in them whiles they do faithfully Serve him, <HI>his delight is in tho&s;e that fear him:</HI> but &s;in is the thing that he cannot endure; and when he hath &s;o warned them again&s;t it, as Jer. 44.4. <HI>Oh do not this abomina|ble

<P N="4">4. Hence they that would prevent the danger, mu&s;t do what in them lieth, to put away the &s;ins that have expo&s;ed their people thereunto. They that would keep off threatned Judgments, mu&s;t thru&s;t out the &s;in that hath expo&s;ed them thereto; the cau&s;e mu&s;t be removed, if the effect be either prevented or made to cea&s;e: all the other cour&s;es that men can take, let them &s;eem to be never &s;o probable, will never avail, whiles this is neglected.

<P N="1">1. That the mo&s;t powerfully Godly, will be mo&s;t Con&s;cientious in this matter. True, to &s;tickle here, and to regard no|thing el&s;e, but in other things to lead a loo&s;e Conver&s;ation among men, is enough to detect men of fal&s;hood, and &s;hews that it is not the fear of God which acts them in this regard. But it is a thing to be ob|&s;erved, that God hath, in all ages of the Church, made his <HI>In&s;titutions</HI> the great <HI>Te&s;t</HI> of the <HI>External Obedience</HI> of his pro|fe&s;&s;ing people: and herein he hath a&s;&s;ert|ed his <HI>Prerogative</HI> to appoint what &s;hall be the <HI>Media</HI> of Communion between him and them: and hereupon if we look into the affair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Church of God in former times, we &s;hall find that the mo&s;t holy men, have been the mo&s;t afraid of deviating here: and tho&s;e my&s;terious
<PB N="145" REF="000963_0144_0FADE504FA3A72C8">
Prophe&s;ies in the latter part of <HI>Ezekiels</HI> Vi&s;ions, have an eye to Go&s;pel times, and we there find how God &s;peaks to the Prophet, Ezek 43.11. <HI>Shew them the form of the hou&s;e, and the fa&s;hion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the Ordi|nances thereof, and all the Laws thereof.</HI> Again, there are &s;ome who are more careful than others in attending on exter|nal duties, they dare not to neglect them, or put them off upon vain pretences; and how many are there who condemn them for this as if they did it all but for a &s;hew? that they read, hear, pray in their Families, and wait upon the publick Ordinances <HI>in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on,</HI> only to make men think them better Chri&s;ti|ans than others; whereas doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly men are the mo&s;t careful in the&s;e performances, only they dare not to re&s;t in the&s;e things.</P>
<P N="2">2. Thus to cen&s;ure them, is to u&s;urp Gods Prerogative in judging the heart. When men do their duty in the outward part of it, it is &s;o far well; and though it be a truth, that there are tho&s;e that make a great &s;hew, and yet do all with a fal&s;e

<P N="3">3. This is al&s;o to &s;in again&s;t the Rule
<PB N="147" REF="000963_0146_0FADE506122877D0">
of Chri&s;tian Charity. We ob&s;erved, that <HI>Charity</HI> is the very bond of Chri&s;tian Communion in this World. Now the proper nature of Charity is to <HI>think the be&s;t</HI> of others, &s;o far as we may have any encouragement &s;o to do; &s;urely then, when we &s;ee men to be zealous for the Ordinances of Chri&s;t, and careful in do|ing according to his commands therein, and therein &s;hewing a re&s;pect to all his Precepts; this be&s;peaks in our Con&s;cien|ces that they do well: and unle&s;s we have rea&s;on from their other conver&s;ation a|mong men, to condemn them, we ought to judge them &s;incere; nor are the com|mon infirmities incident to the Children of God in this life, to weaken our Cha|rity on this account. If we are mi&s;taken in this, it will do us no hurt, and <HI>to their own master they mu&s;t &s;tand or fall</HI>; but if we wrong them in our cen&s;ures of them, we bring guilt upon our &s;elves, and pro|voke Gods ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t us.</P>
<P N="3">3. Have a care that you do not take up with, and re&s;t in a form of Godline&s;s; and it concerns us all to take great heed to our &s;elves on this account, and that upon the&s;e three con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="148" REF="000963_0147_0FADE506D7E64940">1. There is great danger of it. It is a thing which &s;inful man is in great hazard of, as will be evident, if we con&s;ider;</P>
<P N="1">1. The natural deceitfulne&s;s and wic|kedne&s;s of the heart; we are told, Jer. 17.9. <HI>The heart is deceitful above all things, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;perately wicked.</HI> Now the wickedne&s;s which is in the heart natural|ly, inclineth us to all manner of &s;in, and is continually prompting of us that way, Gen. 8.21. <HI>the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth.</HI> So that it will do its utmo&s;t to keep out every thing that is truly good; and if we add to this the guile which it is full of, and the in|numerable cunning tricks that it hath to impo&s;e upon men by, yea, upon the man him&s;elf, we may be convinced that we have great rea&s;on to be afraid of being trapanned by it. It is certain, that true Godline&s;s is a thing contrary to the re&s;entments of the corrupt heart in us; if therefore it can but reach to the &s;ini&s;ter ends upon which unregene|rate men do engage in the profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, and yet keep &s;in upon the throne within, it will certainly do it;
<PB N="149" REF="000963_0148_0FADE50791A27EF0">
and it will encourage the man to go through all the formalities of it too, with the greate&s;t &s;hew that can be; and if you tru&s;t to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you will beyond que&s;tion be impo&s;ed on, and never go beyond a form: hence we have that advice, Prov. 28.26. <HI>He that tru&s;teth in his own heart, is a fool.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The&s;e declining times afford great Temptations to it. It is an hour of great trial upon this account; it is a day wherein men generally content them|&s;elves with a form of Godline&s;s, and count that to be &s;ufficient, yea, there are a great many who e&s;teem that too much. Ob&s;erve the frame of many Profe&s;&s;ors, and it looks, as if they were afraid of ha|ving too much of Religion; as if heart piety were a needle&s;s thing; as if it were not a credit, but rather a reproach to a man to be &s;incerely Godly. If you will do as the mo&s;t do, a form will be enough for you; if you will go farther, and re&s;olve to live up to the <HI>Rules</HI> of the Go&s;pel, and lead a <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> in all things <HI>worthy of Christ,</HI> and carefully <HI>a|void the appearances of evil,</HI> you mu&s;t ex|pect to meet with &s;corn, and reproach,

If now you will con&s;ult with fle&s;h and blood, and hearken to carnal rea&s;onings, they will bid you to be content to do as others do, and tell you that you &s;hall fare as well as they; and that it is pride in you to think your &s;elves wi&s;er than your neighbours, or &s;uppo&s;e that none &s;hall obtain heaven and happine&s;s, but &s;uch &s;crupulous per|&s;ons as you are.

<P N="1">1. You cannot impo&s;e upon God.

When there are but a few that &s;eek his honour, it is a &s;pecial call to all &s;uch as are truly Godly, to &s;tand up and appear for it. Certainly, if you have any &s;park of real goodne&s;s in you, if you prefer the Glory of God a|bove all, and do cordially de&s;ire that all men would &s;eek it, it cannot but put you upon being the more careful to your &s;elves about it. When the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath but a <HI>few Friends</HI> in the world, and there are &s;o many that di&s;honour him, they that are indeed his friends, are loudly call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> upon the more eminently to appear &s;o; and you cannot otherwi&s;e &s;hew your &s;elves <HI>true and faithful</HI> to him. When there were a great many pretended Di&s;ciples that de&s;erted Chri&s;t, and <HI>walked no more with him,</HI> he put that clo&s;e que&s;tion to the twelve, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.67. <HI>Will ye al&s;o go away?</HI> When the <HI>Ten Tribes</HI> revolt|ed from the true wor&s;hip of God, and turned a&s;ide to <HI>Jeroboams</HI> Super&s;tition and Idolatry, God gave that admonition to the Kingdom of <HI>Judah, Ho&s;.</HI> 4.15. <HI>Though thou I&s;rael play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend.</HI> And when the body of that people had
<PB N="158" REF="000963_0157_0FADE51743432CB0">
turned from God, and made them a <HI>Golden Calf,</HI> and pro&s;trated them&s;elves to that, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> calls aloud to the people, as, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32.26. <HI>Who is on the Lords &s;ide? let him come unto me.</HI> And we find that the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> pre&s;ently appeared, and they obtained a ble&s;&s;ing upon it. Hereby is a &s;pecial advantage afforded you, to approve your &s;elves &s;incere, and upright in heart, and to bring much glory to God.</P>
<P N="2">2. Your own comfort, in all changes, will be greatly helped by it. We have ob&s;erved, that the be&s;t mu&s;t look to meet with trouble, when God cometh to vi&s;it a people for the&s;e things: nor can they tell how deeply they may per&s;onally &s;uffer in &s;uch times. However, there is a way by which the people of God may come to have much inward tranquility in their Souls, and be able to commit them&s;elves to God with a &s;edate Spirit, when the Storms of Judgments are mo&s;t furious, and <HI>Sinners in Zion are afraid&punc; and fearfulne&s;s &s;urprizeth the Hypocrites</HI>: and this is worth our utmo&s;t endeavour, and the peace of it will make full amends for all the labour we can u&s;e about it. And I am &s;ure that there is nothing that will more largely
<PB N="159" REF="000963_0158_0FADE51884C99DD0">
contribute hereto than this, <HI>viz.</HI> the Te&s;timony of our Con&s;ciences to our &s;in|cerity, in &s;tanding by, and upholding the power of Godline&s;s, in the mo&s;t degene|rate times. This will give rejoycing in the greate&s;t afflictions that can befall us. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ets a <HI>Probatum e&s;t</HI> upon this, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.12. <HI>Our rejoycing is this, the te&s;timony of our Con&s;cience, that in &s;implicity and Godly &s;incerity, we have had our Conver&s;ation in the World.</HI> This will help to fix our hearts in times when the mo&s;t threatning <HI>Symp|toms</HI> of evil appear, and the Clouds are gathering thick and fa&s;t: So it is with him who is upright. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 112.7, 8. <HI>He &s;hall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed&punc; tru&s;ting in the Lord: his heart is e&s;tabli&s;hed he &s;hall not be afraid.</HI> Whereas the want of this integrity, or &s;ome noto|rious defect in it, touching the Con&s;ci|ence, and making it to reflect upon the man, will offer more inward mole&s;tation, and hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t di&s;quietment, than all the out|ward troubles which he can encounter withal.</P>
<P N="3">3. You will meet with great <HI>Temptati|ons,</HI> which will offer to di&s;courage you at &s;uch a time. What they are hath been
<PB N="160" REF="000963_0159_0FADE518D068BAB8">
before taken notice of; and let Godly ones who <HI>have the root of the matter in them,</HI> beware of de&s;pi&s;ing this warning, or thinking them&s;elves out of the reach of the&s;e Temptations. Godly men have a corrupt&punc; part remaining within them, which they do find work enough to &s;uppre&s;s at any time, and it will certainly take advan|tage to urge hard, when it hath motives from without to back its &s;ugge&s;tions with|all: nor will all your Confidence &s;ecure you again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of it, but it will be too hard for you, if you be not very headful to your &s;elves. You have awful in&s;tances of this to give you warning. <HI>Peter</HI> for all his re&s;olution, and repeated purpo&s;es, was yet fearfully over come when the tryal was upon him. <HI>Matth.</HI> 26. <HI>Barnabas</HI> was drawn into a Scandalous di&s;&s;imulation, when <HI>Peter</HI> had begun, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.12. You had need to be well pro|vided, if you will &s;tem the &s;tream of the times, and hold out again&s;t all that would allure you from your fidelity to Chri&s;t, when you may be called to part with e|very thing el&s;e, though never &s;o dear to you, if you will pre&s;erve your integrity immaculate; and for your help on this account.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="161" REF="000963_0160_0FADE51990F08858">1. See to your hearts that they be <HI>right</HI> in all that you do in your profe&s;&s;ion. If God mainly <HI>regards the heart,</HI> it con|cerns all that would approve them&s;elves to him, to do &s;o too. If you can once get them to be right, your main bu&s;ine&s;s is done, and till you have made this &s;ure, you cannot do any thing well. <HI>See then to your through Conver&s;ion</HI>; that indeed is not all that you have to do, but it is the fir&s;t thing, becau&s;e there can nothing be done right without it. It is impo&s;&s;ible that an unconverted heart, &s;hould be a &s;incere heart in Gods account and acceptance; till you have gotten a new heart, you can never go beyond formality in any thing you do; and if you would have &s;uch an heart as this, you mu&s;t go to God for it: It is he alone who can give it to you, and you mu&s;t ask it of him, <HI>Ezek</HI> 36.26. <HI>a new heart will I give you</HI> You mu&s;t al|&s;o call for your heart, every time that you go about any duty, and be &s;ure to take it along with you, if you would be cordial in it; it will be away, if you do not heedfully look after it; and too often doth a Godly man perform this and that Service in formality, becau&s;e of his inadvertency in this regard; or becau&s;e

he tru&s;ts his heart too much, which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of|ten as he doth &s;o, deceiveth him; how careful is <HI>David</HI> in this re&s;pect? P&s;al. 57.8. <HI>Awake my glory, awake p&s;altery and harp; I my &s;elf will awake early.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Set your &s;elves ever in the pre&s;ence of God, as of one who &s;eeth and hateth Hypocri&s;y. We are indeed forbidden to do <HI>eye-&s;ervice</HI> to men, as of a thing which proceeds from a fal&s;e heart; but eye-&s;er|vice to God is every where approved; and there is nothing that can be a more powerful and awful con&s;ideration on our minds, to make us afraid of doing any thing in hypocri&s;y, than to think of tho&s;e two things, and always carry the deep impre&s;&s;ion of them upon our hearts, <HI>viz.</HI> that God &s;tands by, and looks on, and that he cannot abide di&s;&s;imulation; for he is our Law giver, and our Judge, who will call us to an account, and he will judge righteous Judgment, and cannot be mi&s;taken in it. Hence holy men on Scripture Record, have always been wary of this, when they were in a right frame, and made u&s;e of it as a caution to excite them to &s;incerity; thus did <HI>Job,</HI> Chap. 31.4. <HI>Doth not he &s;ee my ways, and count all

my &s;teps</HI>; and <HI>David</HI> &s;aith, P&s;al. 16.8 <HI>I have &s;et the Lord always before me.</HI> It is therefore the character of wicked men, that they think not of God, P&s;al. 10.4. <HI>God is not in all his thoughts</HI>; and they &s;uppo&s;e him to be unconcerned about the affairs of the children of men, and &s;o not to be feared, Ezek. 8.12. <HI>They &s;ay, the Lord &s;eeth us not, the Lord hath for&s;aken the Earth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Maintain and &s;trengthen your <HI>love to God,</HI> and his ways. See that you have this principle in you: where this love is not, the be&s;t that you do will be but for|mality; and you had need to be always nouri&s;hing this principle in you, and get|ting of it coroborated: you will meet with many things that will offer to damp it. If you can but attain to do every thing in true love to God, delighting in his ways, and de&s;iring his glory above all things, this will be the be&s;t help to do all things uprightly; this will make you &s;ee to the matter, and manner, and principle, and end, that all be accommodated to E|vangelical directions and de&s;igns; and ac|cording to the &s;trength and activity of this love in you, &s;uch will be the power of

Godline&s;s appearing in your lives.

<P N="4">4. Labour to experience Communion with God in your &s;erving of him&punc; there is a Communion which Godly men have with God in this life; he could &s;ay, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.3. <HI>Truly our fellow&s;hip is with God the Father, and with his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>; this is it which a &s;incere Chri&s;tian hath an aim at in all that he doth, and there is nothing that can content him without it: Now this Communion is to be had in the way of duty. If you can do du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y contentedly without the enjoyment of it, &amp; if this be your con&s;tant gui&s;e, you are Hypocrites; but if you re&s;tle&s;ly &s;eek it, and he affords it you, make much of it, prize it above every thing in the world, endeavour to be able to &s;ay of it as he, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 84.10. <HI>A day in thy Court<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s is better than a thou&s;and</HI>; and this will certainly

<P N="5">5. De&s;pi&s;e all the contempt and re|proach of carnal and formal men. You mu&s;t expect to meet with enough of it from men of &s;uch a &s;pirit, if you will go one &s;tep before them in the ways of Godline&s;s; and if you are &s;o nice and delicate, as not to be able to bear the bla&s;t of them, you will be put upon it to play the Hypocrite many a time, and can by no means avoid it: You mu&s;t live among them, and have &s;ome una|voidable conver&s;ation with them; and they cannot forbear: you mu&s;t therefore endeavour to imitate your Lord Chri&s;t, of whom it is &s;aid, Heb. 12.2. <HI>That he endured the Cro&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;hame</HI>; and remember what Chri&s;t hath warned you on this account, Mark 8.38. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall be a&s;hamed of me, and of my words, in

<P N="6">6. Seek to, and depend upon Chri&s;t to pre&s;erve you in your integrity; and there is be&s;ides the keeping of Grace alive in you, which is an effect of his power, the upholding of the lively ef|ficacy of it in exerci&s;e to be &s;ought of him; el&s;e you may fall under tho&s;e de|cays, which will grievou&s;ly wound you, and bring &s;orrow upon you; this was the P&s;almi&s;ts reque&s;t unto God, P&s;al. 25 21. <HI>let integrity and uprightne&s;s pre&s;erve me</HI>; and he acknowledgeth that he had a gracious an&s;wer of this prayer, P&s;al. 41.12. <HI>as for me, thou upholde&s;t me in mine integrity.</HI> Be therefore ever jealous of your &s;elves, &s;en&s;ible of your own in&s;ufficiency, and renounce tru&s;t in your own grace, and let that keep you in an humble dependance upon Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. Pray to God to revive dying Re|ligion. Truly you cannot keep up the power of Godline&s;s in your &s;elves with|out this; your hearts cannot but be affected with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Chri|&s;tianity;
