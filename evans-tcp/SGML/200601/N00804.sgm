<HEAD>The Epi&s;tle Dedicatory, To the Churches of Chri&s;t in <HI>N. England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT can incur no ju&s;t Cen&s;ure that we addre&s;s our &s;elves to the Churches of Chri&s;t here in the following Sheets, ina&s;much as they are but a Reply to a Book lately dedicated unto them. Nor does our zeal, (we hope) for Truth, the Honour of God, &amp; the Safety, Peace &amp; Flour|i&s;hing of the&s;e Churches come &s;hort of what our Reverend Author may be in&s;pired with in his performance We make the &s;ame glorious Pretence with him to maintain &amp; defend the Order of the Go&s;pel, altho' we cannot allow what is &s;ugge&s;ted in the Title page. That every Principle &s;o &s;trenu|ou&s;ly contended for in that Treati&s;e, is either profe&s;&s;ed or practi&s;ed by the Churches of Chri&s;t in <HI>New-England.</HI> One part, at lea&s;t, therefore of his Book the Reverend Author ought to have publi&s;hed in his own Name, and not have obtruded it on the Churches here, who&s;e Practi&s;e never gave grounds to &s;u&s;pect them leavened with &s;o gro&s;s thoughts, as particularly his Doctrine of the Ordination of Mini&s;ters is.</P>
<P>We will not gue&s;s at the Authors &s;ecret aim, or whom in particular he rai&s;es his Batteries again&s;t We'd cha|ritably hope he has no private Intere&s;t to bribe him in this Affair; and we hope for a like favourable and candid Con|&s;truction of this Reply. Indeed the Name prefix't to that faulty Treati&s;e, may be pre&s;umed, with a multitude of prejudiced People, to weigh down all the Rea&s;ons and
<PB REF="000967_0004_0FAE3981ACD72428">
Arguments which can po&s;&s;ibly be brought for their Con|viction. And we have no &s;uch advantage to boa&s;t of; yet are happy in this, that we are not over-awed by any Name, and the Truth we know is greater, and more venerable than all things.</P>
<P>Its well known how liberal &s;ome men are of the odious brand of <HI>Apo&s;tates,</HI> for every one who cannot dige&s;t the late publi&s;hed Orders: but, without arrogance, we a&s;&s;ume, as more due, the Title of <HI>Proficients,</HI> and doubt not to make it out, that our di&s;&s;ent from many of them is &s;o far from a going back from any Go&s;pel T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uth or O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">der, that it is rather a making progre&s;s, and advancing in the Evan|gelical Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>It is a groundle&s;s Calumny which is &s;ugge&s;ted, <HI>That a latitude beyond what our Author contends for, is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t a betraying the liberties and priviledges which our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has given to his Church, or the Brethren of the Church.</HI> The&s;e we profe&s;s to prize and &s;tand for, and would by no means lo&s;e. But wherein do they con&s;i&s;t? not in the Brethrens challenging any part of the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ni&s;terial Work! Not in impo&s;ing upon others any thing which Chri&s;t has not impo&s;ed! which is but a debarring Chri&s;tians of the Pri|viledges they have a right to. But they con&s;i&s;t (as we conceive) in &s;uch things as the&s;e. That our Con&s;ciences be not impo&s;ed on by Men or their Traditions, Chri&s;t being the alone Lord of the Con&s;cience, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.23. That Believers are through Chri&s;t, freed from the guilt and do|minion of Sin, from the cur&s;e of the Law, and from the &s;ting and terror of Death. That we have the liberties of Gods Hou&s;e and Ordinances, &amp; therein communion with God. That we may have the benefi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the gifts of his Mini&s;ters for edification, and &s;uch like, according to the Apo&s;tles Doctrine, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.22.</P>
<P><PB REF="000967_0005_0FAE39826EE28488">Nor is that Objection le&s;s frivolous, when if we appear le&s;s Rigid than others of the Reverend Authors &s;everity, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> reflected on as ca&s;ting di&s;honour on our Parents, &amp; their pious de&s;ign in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this Land No, we reverence our Ance&s;tors, and the Memory of their di|vine Zeal and Con&s;tancy, and would derive it as a Truth &s;acred to our Po&s;teri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, that it was a religious Intere&s;t which carried them through all the amazing Difficult<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es &amp; Di&s;couragements in that Undertaking But yet, the par|ticular de&s;ign or end has been &s;ome-what differently con|veyed unto us.</P>
<P>Some have carried it as if the great end were the Con|ver&s;ion of the <HI>Heathen</HI>; and there have been great Com|plaints by &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me of late, how this has been neglected and contradicted, and another cour&s;e taken up, whereby in|&s;tead of bringing the <HI>Heathen</HI> into the Church of God, many who&s;e Fathers and them&s;elves were once of the vi&s;ible Church, are now &s;trangely left out, &s;carce any face of Religion remaining among them.</P>
<P>As for this, we bewail it, and look upon it as a Reproach to the Land, and would therefore countenance no &s;uch Principles or Practices as have any tendency to &s;uch Apo&s;tacy.</P>
<P>Again, &s;ome have made this the great De&s;ign, to be freed from the Impo&s;itions of Men in the Wor&s;hip of God, wherewith they were &s;ometimes burthened; and as they fought freedom for them&s;elves, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e they de&s;ign'd to impo&s;e upon others In this we are ri&s;en up to make good their grounds.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> in his Sermon of the <HI>&s;inful|ne&s;s of Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hipping God with Mens In&s;titutions,</HI> p. 27. gives this as the errand of our fore-Fathers into this Wil|derne&s;s,
<PB REF="000967_0006_0FAE39832205FDD0">
namely, to &s;eque&s;ter them&s;elves into a quiet corner of the World, where they might enjoy Chri&s;ts un|mixt In&s;titutions, and leave them uncorrupted to Po&s;terity; and the gain-&s;aying or counter working this, is, as he in|timates, to ca&s;t di&s;honour upon them, or call them fools.</P>
<P>This Charge falls heavy on tho&s;e who are for impo&s;ing their will on others We crave no more but to enjoy the In&s;titutions of Chri&s;t unmix't And it appears very &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ange that tho&s;e who fled from an Act of Uniformity, &s;hould pre&s;ently impo&s;e on them&s;elves, on their Neighbours, and entail the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;chief on their Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Some indeed would make the de&s;ign of our fir&s;t Plan|ters to con&s;i&s;t in &s;ome little Rites, Modes or Circum&s;tances of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hurch Di&s;cipline, and tho&s;e &s;uch as the Word of God no where requires The&s;e are the men who di&s;honour their Country, and their Fathers Memory, by making their great de&s;ign to lie in &s;o &s;mall matters. And it is notorious there has been no agreement in the&s;e points from the be|ginning. Its known there was <HI>Anti-Synoda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ia</HI> printed, and who had a hand in it, <HI>and how mode&s;t his Di&s;&s;ent was,</HI> and in what terms they contradicted what the Synod had e&s;tabli&s;hed, tho' the like is criminal and in&s;ufferable in any other.</P>
<P>The&s;e Principles in Church Di&s;cipline are al&s;o wrote again&s;t in Engli&s;h by the <HI>A&s;&s;embly of D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vines,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dry,</HI> Mr. <HI>Rutherford,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, &amp;c.</HI> In a word, if it be the Truth, according to Gods Word, we &s;tand for, it would not be grievous to any of our pious Ance&s;tors, were they now on Earth; neither will it be grievous to them now in Heaven: nor &s;hould it be grievous to any good Man to receive Conviction. We refer all therefore to the Word of God, <HI>to the Law and to the Te&s;timony.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="000967_0007_0FAE3983E68557E8">In the <HI>Preface</HI> or Epi&s;tle to &s;aid Book, we find &s;everal things that might be ju&s;tly excepted again&s;t, but de&s;igning neither to be contentious nor volumnious, we &s;hall &s;peak but to one or two.</P>
<P>In <HI>pag.</HI> 8. the Reverend Author is plea&s;ed to number up &s;even or eight erronious Doctrines, as he apprehends them to be; &amp; the con&s;equence from all is this, that if we e&s;pou&s;e the&s;e Principles, we give away the whole <HI>Congregational Cau&s;e</HI> at once. Whence we perceive now the profe&s;&s;ed cau&s;e which the Author engages in; tho' we hope it is not the Name or the Party, but the Truths they defend. We &s;hall have occa&s;ion to examine the&s;e Principles hereafter; it may &s;uffice here to &s;ay, they are <HI>craftily</HI> &amp; <HI>unfairly worded,</HI> &amp; in the Dre&s;s they are here clad, we do not e&s;pou&s;e them; yet according to their mo&s;t fair &amp; genuine con&s;truction there is a great deal of Truth in mo&s;t of them. And this is but a block the Author politickly ca&s;ts in the way, which at la&s;t we fear may but di&s;courage &s;ome from em|bracing the Congregational way, &s;eeing it mu&s;t need<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fight for its life again&s;t &s;ome Truths. <HI>Its hard kicking again&s;t the pricks, Acts</HI> 9.5.</P>
<P>Another thing Remarkable in the <HI>Preface</HI> is the Authors heat and warmth, pag. 9. <HI>Shall we then by Silence betray the Truth?</HI> &s;hall we retort, therefore we are bold to &s;peak too. <HI>Who is on the Lords &s;ide? Who?</HI> &s;hall we an&s;wer, we are&punc; we tru&s;t (through Gods Grace) together with you; and all other &s;iding we would have in contempt. <HI>Is there no one that will &s;tand up for the Churches of Chri&s;t?</HI> God for|bid but we &s;hould, had others declined it! <HI>The good People in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m then ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> well think their Watch-men are all either dead or a &s;leep:</HI> or if they talk light and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eady, they may conclude them in a trance, or not quite awaked. <HI>For

<P>But why all this heat? we would not interpret too hard: but the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions &s;eem plainly to carry this &s;en&s;e, <HI>That every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> publi&s;hed Orders, is an oppo&s;er of Truth, not on the Lords &s;ide, Enemies to the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and the Churches of</HI> New-E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and.

And where he endeavours to confirm his Tenets by the Te&s;timony of &s;ome, he might, if he had plea&s;ed, have brought many others to contradict the &s;ame thing. But this is a good-way to amu&s;e the Reader, and to cloud his mind, and to terrifie him, by mu&s;tering a legion of inar|tifical Arguments. We &s;hall be &s;paring in Quotations, and pa&s;s by many cited by the Author, tho' we approve them not. Only we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e leave to pre&s;ent one Quotation, which may be of u&s;e to us all along, being we are unwil|ling to be impo&s;ed on to believe what God never &s;poke, or to do what God never requir'd. It is that of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Willard,</HI> in his fore-quoted Sermon, <HI>pag.</HI> 23.24.
<Q>Hence it follows, that there is nothing to be received by us on this account, but what has G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds Seal affixed to it.

<P>In the fore-going Chapter, when he would prove there ought to be a tryal of Per&s;ons, he tells us of the <HI>Porters that were &s;et at the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> gates of the Temple,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 23.19. but tho&s;e Porters were Officers 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 6.1. &s;o he In&s;tances in the Twelve Angels at the Gates of the My&s;tic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which tho' it may imply that the Gates were kept, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not that the fraternity were the keepers.

<P>But to examine his &s;trength in this Chapter what he calls argu|ment, may more truly be &s;tiled dogmatical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffirming, or a more mean begging the Que&s;tion. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill pag. 24, 25. he quote a Scrip|ture or two in proof of his a&s;&s;ertions, <HI>&s;cil.</HI> 1 <HI>Corinth.</HI> 5.12. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.6. in both which places the Apo&s;tle is writing to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Church a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Corinth,</HI> about excommunicating the Ince&s;tuous Per&s;on fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his &s;in, and the re&s;toring him again upon his Repentance.

<P>There is another Text al&s;o produced to prove the power of the Brethren, <HI>&s;cil. Mat.</HI> 18.17. and if he &s;hall neglect to hear them, <HI>tell is to the Church.</HI> This Text has been often brought on this account, and &s;ometimes on other accounts and as often an&s;wered, yet here brought again, but it will not an&s;wer the end.</P>
<P>The Context &s;uppo&s;es an Offender, and the wronged party pro|ceeding again&s;t him; and here are three &s;teps the di&s;&s;atisfied Per&s;on is directed to take, in order to heal the wound given, 1.) To tell the Offender his fault in private. 2) To tell him before 2 or 3 wit|ne&s;&s;es, and if the end be not obtained; 3.) To tell it to the Church. Suppo&s;e now a Per&s;on acting according to this Rule (as we could give in&s;tances if need were) when the fir&s;t &s;tep did not gain his Brother, nor the &s;econd an&s;wer the end, at la&s;t the di&s;|&s;atisfied Per&s;on carried the ca&s;e to the <HI>Pa&s;tor,</HI> and now he reckoned he had told it to the Church. The Pa&s;tor &s;ending fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Offendor pre&s;ently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onvinced him, brought him to Repentance, and to give &s;atisfaction, and the thing was i&s;&s;ued. Here the Rule was attended, the Church told, the offendor healed, the wronged Per&s;on &s;atisfied, and the matter i&s;&s;ued, when the Brotherhood all this while knew nothing of it. It is evident from the next ver&s;e, that by the Church mu&s;t be meant tho&s;e who had Power to bind and loo&s;e, which Power Chri&s;t had given to the Apo&s;tles. Moreover let the &s;en&s;e be that the Offence is to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old to the Rulers fir&s;t, and then by them to the

<P>But if Scripture will not prove the Power of the Brethren, po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome venerable Maxim may do the feat. <HI>Quod tangit omnes deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t ab omnibus approbari.</HI> But alas! this Maxim gives &s;o much to the Si&s;ters, as to the Brethren. Surely it is no divine Oracle, it neither came from Heaven, nor is it according to the man|ners of men upon Earth. If a ma&s;ter of a family take in a &s;ojou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nor or a &s;ervant; all are concerned, but their vote is not asked. If a Cap|tain li&s;t a Souldier, all the Company is concerned, but it is done by his Authority, without asking their leave. And pray carry this m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m to the Colledge, and &s;ee if the Pre&s;ident and Fellows will &s;tand by it in their admi&s;&s;ions. If it be objected, that even in all the&s;e ca&s;es if there be any &s;ufficient rea&s;ons pre&s;ented by tho&s;e con|cerned, a prudent Ruler will yield to it; we ea&s;ily grant it, and therefore its not unfit that men be propo&s;ed to the Congregation, if there be any thing to object again&s;t their lives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Another argument for the Brethrens Power in admi&s;&s;ion, is, le&s;t the whole Power &s;hould &s;ometimes re&s;ide in the hands of a &s;ingle Mini&s;ter, and that this is unrea&s;onable we have a Speech quoted from the <HI>Pre&s;biterian Mini&s;ters</HI> in <HI>London.</HI> But it is &s;trangely perverted from their true meanning, as appears not only from the whole &s;eries and &s;cope of the Book, but al&s;o from what is expre&s;&s;ed in the page quo|ted (<HI>p.</HI> 71.) where they &s;ay,
<Q>That the Power cannot be placed in the whole Church collectively taken.</Q>
The Scripture makes an exact di&s;tinction between Rulers and ruled. They only plead that there &s;hould be more Rulers in a Church then one; or that, when there are more, then the Power belongs to the whole meaning, the ruli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g Elders as well as the Teaching. And what is that to the Power of the Brethren? One officer has Power in plain ca&s;es to act in the Kings name.</P>
<P>Indeed our Saviour did frequently &s;end forth his Di&s;ciples two and two.

Are there none that plead for a &s;eperate Covenant, which &s;ome (and generally the le&s;&s;er part) mu&s;t enter into? and if it be good, and for good ends, why mu&s;t &s;o many be excluded? If it be to reform Manners, if to maintain the Mini&s;try and Wor&s;hip of God, if to lay &s;tricter Bonds of Duty, if to bring men more effectually to &s;ubmit to Di&s;cipline, why then are not the whole brought in? for the whole Congregation are oblig'd to the&s;e Duties, and why mu&s;t the Covenant be &s;eperate?</P>
<P>Again, do not &s;ome plead, it is requi&s;it, in order to a Per&s;ons par|taking of the Lords Supper? But did our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t require any &s;uch thing when he fir&s;t in&s;tituted that holy Sacrament? Did the Apo&s;tles when they admini&s;tred it? Was it the term of Communion in the primitive Church? or where is the Scripture that comma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s

it? and why &s;hould Gods holy Ordinances be annexed to Mans Cove|nant? Again, do not &s;ome plead, that tho&s;e who thus covenant, have the Power to make and unmake Officers? The Reverend Au|thor will not &s;cape here, who&s;e Opinion in this matter we &s;hall &s;ee herea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter. And, <HI>finally,</HI> do not &s;ome pretend, That the&s;e are the Per&s;ons commi&s;&s;ioned by Chri&s;t, for the admitting and rejecting of Church Members? This the Reverend Author defends with all his Might, under the third Que&s;tion, tho', as we &s;howed, he could find no Proof. And &s;o much for the Church Covenant, which is a &s;tranger to the Scripture, and has no foundation in the Word of God.</P>
<P>Q. 6. <HI>Is publick Reading of the Scriptures, without explication or ex|hortation there-with, part of the Work incumbent on a Minister of the Go&s;pel?</HI></P>
<P>The Author does not mean, (as we &s;uppo&s;e,) if there be no ex|plication or exhortation throughout the whole time of exerci&s;e. If he doth, he fights with the air, for we know no Sect of Men but have &s;ome explication, tho' many among us neglect reading. We therefore take his &s;en&s;e to be this, If no explication follow immedi|ately without the interpo&s;ition of Prayer, or any other part of divine Wor&s;hip. For we conceive that the ordinary preaching the Word may very properly be call'd <HI>expo&s;ition, explication</HI> &amp; <HI>exhortation,</HI> and that in every Sermon there is a competent portion of Scripture for one time explicated and applyed. Nor can we imagine, the Re|verend Author means that every clau&s;e a Mini&s;ter reads in publick &s;hould be in a formal manner explicated: Methinks it &s;hould &s;atisfie, if after one or more Chapters read, &s;ome &s;elect clau&s;e, ver&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> para|graph be in&s;i&s;ted on and expounded, <HI>i. e.</HI> cho&s;en as a Text, and preached on.</P>
<P>We are obliged to the Author, if but for quoting the Text in <HI>Ti|mothy,</HI> where it is given him in charge, as his Mini&s;terial Work&punc; <HI>To give attendance to Reading, as well as to Doctrine &amp; Exhortation. That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Jews <HI>were wont to read the Scriptures in their Synagogue,</HI> &s;aith the Reverend Author, <HI>we all know; and that it was their Duty to read the Scripture at &s;ome &s;et and &s;olemn Times, we al&s;o know; for &s;o it was ap|pointed,</HI> Deut. 31.11. Again, he grants that in <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyrs</HI> time <HI>the Scriptures were read, and thereupon followed a Sermon.</HI></P>

<P>We would offer here one Query more.

<P>But to detain the Reader no longer, 'tis enough and enough that the Reverend Author ju&s;tifies it as lawful; for then doubtle&s;s it may be &s;ometimes proper: for that would be a &s;trange thing indeed, that is always lawful, and never (in no Circum&s;tances&punc; not in that of Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> him&s;elf) can be proper.
