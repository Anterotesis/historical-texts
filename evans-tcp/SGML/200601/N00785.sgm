<P N="6">6 'Tis not practicable to make any an&s;wer to the &s;ixth Query, becau&s;e the Neighbouring Colonies are not in the power of the &s;aid Earl to induce them to a Contribution to the charge that has been propo&s;ed, neither indeed were it &s;afe to delay this Undertaking &s;o long as till our Neighbours could be ask't the Que&s;tion.</P>
