<L>THe staffe of bread, and water eke the stay,</L>
<L>From sinning <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> God will take away,</L>
<L>The prudent <HI>Counsellour,</HI> the <HI>Honourable,</HI></L>

<L>To wish the <HI>aged</HI> soon might quit their station,</L>

<L>When aged Saints dy death do tumble down.</L>
<L>What tho' there be not such Activity,</L>
<L>Yet in their Prayers there's such <HI>Fervency </HI></L>
<L>As doth great mercy for a place obtain,</L>
<L>And gracious presence of the Lord maintain.</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Nature</HI>'s strength in old age doth decay.</L>
<L>Yet th' <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">,</HI> day.</L>
<L>The very presence of a Saint in years</L>
<L>Who lifts his soul to God with pray'rs &amp; tears</L>
<L>Is a rich blessing unto any place</L>
<L>Who have that mercy to behold his face:</L>
<L>When Sin is ripe and calls for desolation</L>
<L>God will call home <HI>old Saint:</HI> from such a nation</L>

<L>God give us grace to mourn most heartily</L>
<L>For death of this dear servant of the Lord,</L>
<L>Whose life God did to us so long afford:</L>
<L>God lent his life to greatest <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of dayes;</HI></L>
<L>In which he liv'd to his Redeemer's praise.</L>
<L>In youthful time he made <HI>Moses</HI> his choice,</L>
<L>His soul obe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>JEHOVAH</HI>'s voice,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> forsook the world for sake of GOD,</L>
<L>In His House with His Saints to have abode,</L>
<L>He <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> GOD into this Wilderness;</L>
<L>Thereby to all the world he did profess,</L>
<L><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the Saints</HI> a better part</L>
<L>And more delightful to his holy heart</L>
<L>Than <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> lasting out a season:</HI></L>
<L>Thus said his <HI>Faith,</HI> so saith not carnal <HI>Reason</HI></L>
<L>He came one of the first into this Land,</L>
<L>And here was kept by <HI>God</HI>'s most gracious hand</L>
<L>Years <HI>sixty seven,</HI> which time he did behold</L>
<L>To poor <HI>New-England</HI> mercies Manifold:</L>
<L>All God's great works to this His <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></L>
<L>From first implanting what to them befel:</L>
<L>Of them he made a serious Observation,</L>
<L>And could of them present a large Narration,</L>
<L>His walk was <HI>holy, humble,</HI> and sincere,</L>
<L>His heart was filled with JEHOVAH's Fear.</L>
<L>He honour'd GOD with much integrity,</L>
<L>God therefore did <HI>him</HI> truly magnify.</L>
<L>The hearts of Saints intirely did him love,</L>
<L>His Uprightness so highly did approve,</L>
<L>That whilst to choose they had their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</L>
<L>Within the Limits of this <HI>Colony</HI></L>
<L>Their <HI>Civil Leaders,</HI> him they ever chose.</L>
<L>His <HI>Faithfulness</HI> made hearts with him to close.</L>
<L>With <HI>all</HI> the Governours he did <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">;</L>
<L>His Name recorded is within the List</L>
<L>Of <HI>Plimouth</HI>'s Pillars to his dying day.</L>
<L>His Name is precious to eternal Ay.</L>
<L>He set his Love on God and knew His Name,</L>
<L>God therefore gives him everlasting Fame.</L>
<L>So good and heav'nly was his Conversation,</L>
<L>God gave <HI>long life,</HI> and <HI>shew'd him His Salvation.</HI></L>
<L>(His work now finished upon this earth,</L>
<L>Seeing the death of what he saw the birth)</L>
<L>His gracious Lord from heaven calls him home,</L>
<L><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 line"></HI></L>
<L><HI>Thou hast done good, been faithful unto Me,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Now shalt thou live in bliss ETERNALLY.</HI></L>
<L>On dying bed his Ailes were very great,</L>
<L>Yet verily his heart on GOD was set.</L>
<L>He bare his greifs with Faith and Patience,</L>
<L>And did maintain his lively confidence</L>
<L>Saying to some, The work which God begun,</L>
<L>He would preserve to be perfection.</L>
<L>His mouth was full of blessings till his death</L>
<L>To Ministers and Christians all: his breath</L>
<L>Was very sweet by many a precious word</L>
<L>He utter'd from the Spirit of his Lord.</L>
<L>He liv'd in <HI>Christ,</HI> in <HI>Jesus</HI> now he sleeps:</L>
<L>And his blest soul the Lord in safely keeps,</L>
