<HEAD>A VINDICATION OF THE Divine Authority of <HI>Ruling Elders,</HI> &amp;c. In An&s;wer to an Objection.</HEAD>
<P>Object. <HI>BEcau&s;e it &s;ets up a new Officer in the</HI> Church, <HI>which is a meer humane Creature, having no authority from the Word of</HI> GOD, <HI>nor was ever heard of in the Church of Chri&s;t, till</HI> Calvin<HI>'s time, and that is the</HI> LAY-ELDER.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> WE do here freely con|fe&s;s, that we were of opinion, as &s;ome are, that the Ruling-El|der hath no foundation in the Word of God, but is a meer humane Ordinance brought into the Church only in a prudential way; we
<PB N="2" REF="000957_0003_0FAD975FD449BDA8" MS="y">
&s;hould heartily de&s;ire the utter abolition of him: For we are not ignorant, that the Ru|ling Prelate was brought into the Church upon the &s;ame account, for the avoiding of Schi&s;m and Divi&s;ion, and afterwards proved the great Author and Fomenter of Schi&s;m and Divi&s;ion. And if we would decline the Ruling Prelate, and take in the Ruling El|der upon the &s;ame prudential grounds, it were ju&s;t with God to make him as mi&s;chie|vous to the Church, as ever the Ruling Pre|late was: And therefore let us con&s;ider what may be &s;aid out of the Word of God, for the Ju&s;tification of this &s;o much <HI>decryed Officer</HI>: Yet fir&s;t we cannot but take notice that the name of <HI>Lay-Elder</HI> was affixed to this Officer by way of reproach and &s;corn, by the ad|ver&s;aries of him, and that it ought not to be continued. For though it be evident by Scripture, [<HI>Heb.</HI> 13.17, 24.] that there is a great difference betwixt the Mini&s;try, u&s;u|ally called the Clergy, and the people com|monly called the Laity: Yet its al&s;o as ma|nife&s;t, that the Scripture di&s;tingui&s;heth them not by the names of Clergy and Laity: for|a&s;much as all Gods people are therein &s;tiled the Lords Clergy or Inheritance, [1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.3. <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.16.] and the Lord is called their Inheritance. And when per&s;ons are duly cho&s;en from among&s;t the people to be Go|vernours
<PB N="3" REF="000957_0004_0FAD97609124F250">
in the Church, as &s;uch, they are no longer Lay-men, but Eccle&s;ia&s;tical per|&s;ons. And therefore we profe&s;s a di&s;like of the name Lay-Elder, and conceive they ought to be called either Governours in the Church, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.23. or Ruling-Elders: as 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. not becau&s;e their Office is to rule alone (for the Teaching-Elder is a Ru|ler al&s;o,) <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.17. 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5.12. but be|cau&s;e their Office is only to rule. Now concerning the&s;e Ruling-Elders, we confe&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Non quia &s;oli, &s;ed quia &s;olum prae&s;unt.</HI></NOTE> that they are Officers &s;omewhat new &amp; &s;trange to the Church of <HI>England;</HI> yet not new nor &s;trange to the Word of God, nor to the Primitive Times, nor (as all know) to the <HI>Reformed Churches.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>They are not new nor &s;trange to the Word of God, neither in the Old-Te&s;tament, nor in the New.</HI> The Jews in the Old-Te&s;tament, had two &s;orts of Elders, <HI>Elders of the Prie&s;ts, and Elders of the People;</HI> &s;uitable to our <HI>Teaching and Ruling Elders,</HI> as appears, <HI>Jer.</HI> 19.1. And the&s;e Elders of the people did &s;it and vote with the Prie&s;ts and Levites in all their Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;i&s;tories, and that by divine appointment. That they were <HI>con&s;tituent</HI> members of the great <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> appears, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19.8. where we read, that <HI>&s;ome of the chief of the Fathers were joyned with the Prie&s;ts,
<PB N="4" REF="000957_0005_0FAD976151378820">
to judge in the matters of the Lord.</HI> And how|&s;oever, many things among the Jews after the Captivity, did decline to di&s;order and confu&s;ion; yet we find even in the days of Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles, That the Elders of the people &s;till &s;ate and voiced in the Coun|cel with the Prie&s;ts, according to the anci|ent form, as is clear from <HI>Matth.</HI> 26.57, 59. <HI>Matth.</HI> 27.1, 12. <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.21. <HI>Mat.</HI> 21.23. <HI>Mark</HI> 14.43. <HI>Luk.</HI> 22.66. and <HI>Saravia</HI> him&s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De diver&s;. grad. Minist. Evang.</HI> cap. 11. p. 108.</NOTE> who di&s;puteth &s;o much again&s;t <HI>Ru|ling Elders,</HI> acknowledgeth thus much: <HI>I find indeed,</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>Elders in the A&s;&s;embly of the Prie&s;ts of the old Synagogue, which were not Prie&s;ts; and their &s;uffrages and authority in all judgments, were equal with the &s;uffrages of the Prie&s;ts.</HI> But he adds, <HI>That the&s;e Elders of the people, were Civil Magi&s;trates;</HI> which is a poor &s;hift, directly again&s;t many Scriptures, which contradi&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e <HI>Elders</HI> from the Civil <HI>Magi&s;trate;</HI> as appears, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.5. <HI>Judg.</HI> 8.14. <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.23. <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 8.33. 2 <HI>King.</HI> 10.15. <HI>Ezra.</HI> 10.14. And though it were po&s;&s;ible, that &s;ome of them might be Civil <HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> as &s;ome Elders among us, are Ju&s;tices of the Peace; Yet they did not &s;it under that ca|pacity, in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> but as Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Elders.</P>
<P>And that the Jews al&s;o had <HI>Elders of the peo|ple,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="000957_0006_0FAD976212664FD8">
&s;itting and voting in their inferiour Con|&s;i&s;tories, appears (as we humbly conceive) from <HI>Acts</HI> 13.15. <HI>Acts</HI> 18.8, 17. <HI>Mar.</HI> 5.22. In which places, we read of the Rulers of the Synagogue, who were neither Prie&s;ts nor Levites, and yet were Rulers in Church-mat|ters, and had power, together with the Prie&s;ts, of ca&s;ting men out of the Synagogue, and of ordering Synagogue-wor&s;hip, <HI>Joh.</HI> 12.42. <HI>Acts</HI> 13.15.</P>
<P>Now this <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> of the <HI>Elders of the peo|ple, with the Prie&s;t, in the Jewi&s;h Church-Go|vernment, was by Divine Appointment;</HI> for <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI> fir&s;t in&s;tituted it, and afterwards <HI>Jeho&s;aphat</HI> re&s;tored it, according as they were directed by God, <HI>Numb.</HI> 11.16. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19.8. And it did belong to the <HI>Jewi&s;h Church,</HI> not as it was Jewi&s;h, but as it was a Church, and therefore belongeth to the Chri&s;tian Church, as well as Jewi&s;h. <HI>For what&s;oever agreeth to a Church, as a Church; agreeth to every Church.</HI> There was nothing Judaical or typical in this in&s;titution, but it was founded upon the light of nature, and right rea&s;on, which is alike in all ages.</P>
<P>But leaving the Old Te&s;tament, let us con&s;ider what may be &s;aid for the Divine Right of the <HI>Ruling-Elder,</HI> out of the New-Te&s;tament. For this purpo&s;e, we have al|ready produced three places, which we &s;hall
<PB N="6" REF="000957_0007_0FAD9762D403EAA8">
now briefly open; and &s;hew how the Ru|ling-Elder is proved out of them. The places are, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28. <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.7, 8. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t place is, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28. <HI>And God hath &s;et &s;ome in the Church, fir&s;t, Apo&s;tles; &s;econdarily, Prophets, thirdly, Teachers; After that, Miracles; then gifts of healing, helps, governments, diver&s;ities of tongues;</HI> where we have an enumeration of &s;undry Officers of the Church; and among&s;t others,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Calvin in locum Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> up|on 1 Cor. 12.28. <HI>E&s;tius</HI> upon 1 Cor. 12.28.</NOTE> there are <HI>Helps, Governments.</HI> By <HI>Helps,</HI> are meant <HI>Deacons;</HI> (as not only our <HI>Reformed Divines,</HI> but <HI>Chry|&s;o&s;tome</HI> and <HI>E&s;tius,</HI> and others ob|&s;erve) and by <HI>Governments,</HI> are meant the <HI>Ruling-Elder;</HI> which that it may the better appear, we will propound, and prove the&s;e &s;ix things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That by <HI>Governments,</HI> are meant <HI>men ex|erci&s;ing Government,</HI> the <HI>Ab&s;tract</HI> put for the <HI>Concrete.</HI> The intent of the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> is not to &s;peak of <HI>Offices</HI> di&s;tinct from <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> but of <HI>Per&s;ons exerci&s;ing Offices.</HI> This appears fir&s;t, by the beginning of the ver&s;e, <HI>God hath &s;et &s;ome in his Church;</HI> this relates to per&s;ons, not un|to Offices. Secondly, by the 29. and 30. ver&s;es, where the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks <HI>concretively,</HI> of tho&s;e things which he had &s;poken before <HI>ab&s;tractively. Are all workers of miracles? have
<PB N="7" REF="000957_0008_0FAD976391336970">
all the gifts of healing? do all &s;peak with tongues,</HI> &amp;c? and &s;o by con&s;equence, <HI>Are all helpers, are all Governours?</HI> And therefore it is, that the Syriack in&s;tead of <HI>helps, Governments,</HI> reads it <HI>helpers, Governours.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Governour</HI> here meant, mu&s;t needs be a <HI>Church-Governour</HI>; for it is expre&s;|ly &s;aid, that he is &s;eated in the Church, and therefore the Civil Magi&s;trate cannot be meant by this Governour, as &s;ome would have it; partly, becau&s;e this is quite be&s;ides the whole intent and &s;cope of the Chapter, treating meerly upon <HI>&s;piritual Church-matters,</HI> not at all of &s;ecular civil matters; and part|ly, becau&s;e the Magi&s;trate, as &s;uch, is not placed by God in the <HI>Church,</HI> but in the <HI>Common-wealth:</HI> and partly, becau&s;e the A|po&s;tle writes of &s;uch Governours, that had at that time actual exi&s;tence in the Church; and neither then, nor divers hundred years after, were there any <HI>Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trates.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That this <HI>Church-Governour</HI> is &s;eated by God in his Church; It is a <HI>plant of Gods own planting,</HI> and therefore &s;hall &s;tand firm, mau|gre all oppo&s;ition. For it is expre&s;ly &s;aid, <HI>God hath &s;et &s;ome in his Church, fir&s;t Apo&s;tles,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>then helps, then Governments.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That this Church-Governour thus &s;eat|ed by God in his Church, is not onely a <HI>Church-Member,</HI> but a <HI>Church-Officer.</HI> For
<PB N="8" REF="000957_0009_0FAD976817CA9768">
though it be a que&s;tion among&s;t the Learn|ed, whether &s;ome of the per&s;ons here na|med, as the <HI>workers of miracles,</HI> and tho&s;e that had the <HI>gift of healing and of tongues,</HI> were &s;eated by God, as Officers in the Church, and not rather, only as eminent members indued with the&s;e eminent gifts; yet it is mo&s;t certain, that who&s;oever is &s;eated by God in his Church, as a <HI>Church-Governour,</HI> mu&s;t needs be a <HI>Church-Officer;</HI> for the na|ture of the gift, doth nece&s;&s;arily imply an Office. The Greek word for Governments,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> is a metaphor from <HI>Pilots,</HI> or <HI>Ship-Ma&s;ters,</HI> governing their Ships; (hence the Ma&s;ter of a Ship is called <GAP DESC="foreign">, a Governour, <HI>Jam.</HI> 3.4.) and it notes &s;uch Officers as &s;it at the &s;tern of the Ve&s;&s;el of the Church, to govern and guide it in &s;piritu|als, according to the will and mind of Chri&s;t, which is the direct Office of our <HI>Ruling-Elder.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. This Church-Governour thus &s;eated by God in his Church as a <HI>Church-Officer,</HI> is <HI>an ordinary and perpetual Officer in his Church.</HI> Indeed, here is mention made of Officers ex|traordinary, as Apo&s;tles, Prophets; and of gifts extraordinary, as the gift of miracles, healing and of tongues; but here is al&s;o mention made of ordinary Officers, perpetu|ally to abide, as <HI>Teachers, Helpers,</HI> and the
<PB N="9" REF="000957_0010_0FAD9768D2BB8070">
<HI>Church-Governour, or Ruling-Elder.</HI> And that this Officer is ordinary and perpetual, ap|pears from the perpetual nece&s;&s;ity of him in the Church; for a Church without Go|vernment, is as a Ship without a Pilot, as a Kingdom without a Magi&s;trate, and a world without a Sun.</P>
<P N="6">6. That this Church-Governour thus &s;ea|ted by God in his Church, as a perpetual Officer, is an Officer <HI>contra-di&s;tingui&s;hed in the Text from the</HI> Apo&s;tles, Prophets, Tea|chers, <HI>and all other</HI> Officers <HI>in the Church.</HI> This appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. By the Apo&s;tles manner of expre&s;&s;ing the&s;e Officers in an <HI>enumerative</HI> form; Fir&s;t, <HI>Apo&s;tles; Secondarily, Prophets; Thirdly, Teach|ers; After that, Miracles, then gifts of heal|ing,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the recapitulation, ver&s;. 29, 30. <HI>Are all Apo&s;tles? Are all Prophets? Are all Teach|ers? Are all workers of miracles?</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the &s;cope of the whole Chapter, which is to &s;et down different gifts and offices in different &s;ubjects; It is &s;aid, ver&s;. 8, 9. <HI>To one is given by the Spirit, the word of wi&s;dom; to another, the word of knowledge by the &s;ame Spirit; to another, faith,</HI> &amp;c. And for this purpo&s;e, the Apo&s;tle draweth a &s;imile from the members of man's bo|dy: As there are different members in
<PB N="10" REF="000957_0011_0FAD976991BBFE48">
mans body, and every member hath its different office, and every member &s;tands in need one of another; the Eye cannot &s;ay to the Hand, I have no need of thee; nor again, the head to the foot, I have no need of thee, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So it is in the Church Mini&s;terial, which is the Body of Chri&s;t. God hath &s;et different Officers in his Church&punc; &s;ome ordinary and perpetual; &s;ome extraordinary and temporary: And the&s;e different Officers, have different Offi|ces; &s;ome to teach, others to di&s;tribute to the poor Saints, others to govern. Are all Tea|chers? are all Deacons? are all Church-Gover|nours? and the&s;e have all need one of ano|ther. The Teacher cannot &s;ay to the Deacon, I have no need of thee; nor to the Church-Governour, I have no need of thee: But if all the&s;e Officers were in the Pa&s;tor alone, and only, then might he truly &s;ay to the Deacon and Ruling-Elder, I have no need of thee. But now God hath &s;o &s;et the Members in his Body, which is his Church, that every member &s;tands in need one of anothers help and &s;upport.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> If it be objected, that the Apo&s;tles had all the&s;e offices and gifts here mentio|ned, eminently &s;eated in them; for they were Prophets, Teachers, Workers of Mira|cles,
<PB N="11" REF="000957_0012_0FAD976A51496A40">
and therefore why may not all the&s;e be under&s;tood of one and the &s;ame per&s;on?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Though it be true, that the Apo|&s;tles had eminently all the&s;e; yet it is as true, that there are many here named, which had but one of the&s;e gifts formally &s;eated in them: And it is al&s;o apparent, that &s;ome of the per&s;ons here named were di&s;tinct Offi|cers in the Church, as the Prophet, and the Teacher. Though the Apo&s;tles were Pro|phets and Teachers, yet the Prophet and the Teacher were Officers di&s;tinct from the Apo|&s;tles; and by a parity of Rea&s;on, &s;o were the Governours from the Apo&s;tle, Prophet, &amp; Tea|cher; the &s;cope of the Apo&s;tle being (as hath been &s;aid) to &s;et out di&s;tinct Offices in di&s;tinct Officers: are all Apo&s;tles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? The &s;um of what we have &s;aid from this Scripture, then is this, <HI>That God hath &s;eated &s;ome men in his Church which have a gift and office to govern, which are neither Apo&s;tles, Prophets, Teachers, nor Pa|&s;tors; and therefore they are Ruling-Elders,</HI> which is the Officer we are enquiring after.</P>
<P>Now this interpretation which we have given, is not only the interpretation of Re|formed Divines, both <HI>Lutherane</HI> and <HI>Calvi|ni&s;ts,</HI> but of the ancient Fathers, and even

But we an&s;wer:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the word <HI>Gift</HI> is often in Scrip|ture taken for <HI>Office; as Eph.</HI> 4.8.11. <HI>When he a&s;cended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave Gifts unto men,</HI> and v.11. <HI>He &s;hew|eth what the&s;e Gifts were, &s;ome to be Apo&s;tles, &s;ome Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Apo&s;tle in the <HI>Prota&s;is</HI> &s;peaks not of &s;everal Gifts, but of &s;everal Offices, and the&s;e not in the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> but in &s;everal <HI>members,</HI> ver. 4. <HI>As we have many members in one body, and all members have not the &s;ame office.</HI> And therefore the <HI>apodo&s;is</HI> mu&s;t al&s;o be under&s;tood not only of <HI>&s;everal gifts,</HI> but of <HI>&s;everal Offices,</HI> and the&s;e in <HI>&s;everal &s;ubjects.</HI> And this further appears by the very &s;imi|litude which the Apo&s;tle here u&s;eth, which is the &s;ame he u&s;ed. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. from the bo|dy natural, wherein there are many di&s;tinct members, and every member hath its di&s;tinct Office; and &s;o it is in the Church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="000957_0016_0FAD976D5144C2D8">3. The&s;e gifts here mentioned, and the waiting upon them, do nece&s;&s;arily imply an Office in whom&s;oever they are; and there|fore they are &s;et down emphatically with an Article, <GAP DESC="foreign">. He that hath the gift of teaching, and exhorting, &amp; ruling, and waiteth upon this gift, what is he but a Teacher, Pa&s;tor, and Ruling-El|der? And this mu&s;t either be granted, or el&s;e we mu&s;t open a door for all members of the Church, even women, not only to preach and teach, but to rule al&s;o, and to wait upon preaching and ruling: This truth is &s;o clear, as that the Papi&s;ts them&s;elves be|ing convinced of it, do &s;ay upon this Text, that the Apo&s;tle here fir&s;t &s;peaks of gifts in general; and &s;econdly, applyeth the&s;e gifts to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Offi|cers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cornelius a la|pide, in</HI> Rom. 12.6, 7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>v.</HI> 6. and afterwards directs his exhortation to all Chri&s;tians in general.</P>

<HEAD>QUESTION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WHether are not the Brethren, and not the Elders of the Church only, to Judge con|cerning the Qualifications and Fitne&s;s, of tho&s;e who are Admitted into their Communion?</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>There is &s;ome difference of Apprehen&s;ion, and yet no breach of Amity or <HI>Union,</HI> as to this <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> between the Brethren of the Presbyterian, and the Congregational way, the former giving this power only to the <HI>El|der&s;hip,</HI> the latter joyning the <HI>Fraternity</HI> with them. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>In Re&s;p. ad Apollon.</HI> p. 13.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> and from him Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> has Judiciou&s;ly &s;tated and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed this Con|trover&s;y. Let their and &s;ome other Arguments be duely weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</P>
<P N="1">1. They that have power in Admi&s;&s;ion have power to Judge whether the Per&s;ons to be Admitted are duely qualified for Admi&s;&s;ion. But this is true of the <HI>Fraternity</HI> as well as of the <HI>Presbytery.</HI> No one can be Admitted into the Church by the Elders without the Con|&s;ent of the Brethren. The Community is concerned in who are Admitted, and there|fore &s;hould concur therein. Its a received
<PB N="23" REF="000957_0024_0FAD9777D17EAEF8">
maxim, <HI>Quod tangit omnes, debet ab omnibus ap|probari.</HI> And rea&s;on &s;ays, They that have power to Admit, have power to Judge whe|ther the Per&s;ons who de&s;ire it, are fit for that Admittance.</P>
<P N="2">2. They that have power to Judge whe|ther a Per&s;on is fit to be ca&s;t out of Commu|nion, have power to Judge whether he is fit to be received into Communion. <HI>The Key</HI> [the power] <HI>of Opening and Shutting</HI> belongs to the &s;ame Per&s;ons. But it is clear from the Scripture, that the Brethren and not the El|ders only have power to Judge whether an Offender is fit to be Excommunicated, <HI>Matt.</HI> 18.17. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.12. All Orthodox Divines agree that Church Di&s;cipline &s;hould be Ex|erci&s;ed, <HI>Con&s;entiente plebe.</HI> So among&s;t the Ancients, <HI>Cyprian, Ambro&s;e, Au&s;tin, Jerom, Chry&s;o&s;tom, Nazianzene, Theodoret, Theophylact.</HI> And among&s;t our Modren Divines, <HI>Calvin, Beza, Bullinger, Melancton, Junius, Pareus, Rivet, Trelcatius.</HI> If their con&s;ent is nece&s;&s;ary, than they have power to Judge whether they ought to con&s;ent or no.</P>
<P N="3">3. They that have power to Judge whe|ther a Per&s;on Excommunicated, is fit to be re&s;tored to the Communion of the Church, have power to Judge whether Per&s;ons never yet received into the Communion of the Church are duely qualified for that Commu|nion.
<PB N="24" REF="000957_0025_0FAD9778933F5670">
But the Apo&s;tle writes to <HI>the Brethren,</HI> as well as to <HI>the Elders,</HI> of the Church in <HI>Co|rinth,</HI> to re&s;tore a Penitent, whom they had according to the Di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t laid un|der a Church cen&s;ure, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.6. If the Bre|thren are competent Judges concerning the Repentance of a Lap&s;ed Communicant, they are not incompetent Judges of the Repen|tance of other Per&s;ons that may offer them|&s;elves to their Communion.</P>
<P N="4">4. When <HI>Saul</HI> de&s;ired to joyn to the Church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> he was not admitted until the Brethren were by the <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> of <HI>Barnabas,</HI> together with his own <HI>Declaration,</HI> &s;atisfyed concerning the reality of his Faith and Re|pentance, <HI>Act.</HI> 9.26, 27.</P>
<P N="5">5. If only Elders have power to Judge who are fit to come to the Sacrament or to joyn to the Churches, then in ca&s;e there is but one Elder in a Church (as there are very few Churches in <HI>New-Englnd</HI> that have more Elders than one) the Sole power will re&s;ide in that one mans hands. Then by a parity of rea&s;on one alone would have power to &s;u&s;pend from Communion, which Judicious Presbyterians do not allow of. For the <HI>Lon|don</HI> Mini&s;ters in their Vindication of the Pre&s;|byterian Government, (<HI>p.</HI> 70, 71.) have the&s;e Words.
<Q>It is (&s;ay they) as warrantable by the Word of God, for one Mini&s;ter to a&s;&s;ume
<PB N="25" REF="000957_0026_0FAD9779518123E0">
unto him&s;elf alone the power of Su&s;pend|ing from the Sacrament, as it is to a&s;&s;ume the whole power of admitting to the Sacra|ment, for <HI>contrariorum eadem e&s;t ratio:</HI> For one Mini&s;ter alone to a&s;&s;ume this power to him&s;elf, is to make him&s;elf a Congregatio|nal Pope. It is a bringing into the Church a power that would have &s;ome re&s;emblance to Auricular Confe&s;&s;ion.</Q>
Thus &s;aid the Presbyterians Fifty years ago.</P>
<P N="6">6. The way to keep Popery out of the World, is for the <HI>Fraternity</HI> in Churches to a&s;&s;ert and maintain that power and priviledge, which does of right belong unto them. Certain it is, that in the fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;ti|anity this power which we plead for, was not taken out of the hands of the Brother-hood. One of the Ancients, who&s;e writings give us the greate&s;t in-&s;ight, into what was the gene|ral practice of the Churches, in the <HI>Third Century,</HI> makes this pa&s;t di&s;pute. In <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Cyprian. <HI>Epi&s;t.</HI> 40.</NOTE> one of his Epi&s;tles, he has the&s;e words, <HI>Examinabuntur Singela Pru&s;entibus et judicantibus vobis.</HI> And in ano|ther, <HI>Vix plebi per&s;uadeo et tales pa|tiantur admitti.</HI> That he had much adoe to per&s;wade the People to be &s;atisfyed with the.
