<HEAD>The <HI>SECRETARY</HI> of <HI>STATE,</HI> to whom was referred, by the <HI>HOUSE</HI> of <HI>REPRESENTATIVES</HI> of the United States, the petition of <HI>Jacob I&s;aacks,</HI> of Newport, in Rhode-I&s;land, has examined into the truth and importance of the alle|gations therein &s;et forth, and makes thereon the following REPORT.</HEAD>
<P>THE petitioner &s;ets forth, that, by various experiments, with con&s;iderable labor and expence, he has di&s;covered a method of converting &s;alt-water into fre&s;h, in the proportion of 8 pints out of 10, by a proce&s;s &s;o &s;imple that it may be performed on board of ve&s;&s;els at &s;ea by the common iron cabou&s;e with &s;mall alterations, by the &s;ame fire, and in the &s;ame time, which it u&s;ed for cooking the &s;hip's provi&s;ions; and offers to convey to the government of the United States a faithful account of his art, or &s;ecret, to be u&s;ed by or within the United States, on their giving to him a reward &s;uitable to the importance of the di&s;covery, and, in the opinion of government, adequate to his expences, and the time he has devoted to the bringing it into effect.</P>
<P>In order to a&s;certain the merit of the petitioner's di&s;covery, it becomes ne|ce&s;&s;ary to examine the advances already made in the art of converting &s;alt-water into fre&s;h.</P>
<P>Lord Bacon, to whom the world is indebted for the fir&s;t germs of &s;o many branches of &s;cience, had ob&s;erved, that, with a heat &s;ufficient for di&s;tillation, &s;alt will not ri&s;e in vapour, and that &s;alt-water di&s;tilled, is fre&s;h. And it would &s;eem that all mankind might have ob&s;erved, that the earth is &s;upplied with fre&s;h-water chiefly by exhalation from the &s;ea, which is in fact an in&s;en|&s;ible di&s;tillation effected by the heat of the &s;un. Yet this, though the mo&s;t obvious, was not the fir&s;t idea in the e&s;&s;ays for converting &s;alt-water into fre&s;h. Filtration was tried in vain, and congelation could be re&s;orted to only in the colde&s;t regions and &s;ea&s;ons. In all the earlier trials by di&s;tillation, &s;ome mixture was thought nece&s;&s;ary to aid the operation by a partial precipitation of the &s;alt, and other foreign matters contained in &s;ea-water. Of this kind were the methods of Sir Richard Hawkins, in the 16th century, of Glauber, Hauton and Li&s;ter, in the 17th, and of Hales, Appleby, Butler, Chapman, Hoffman and Dove, in the 18th: nor was there any thing in the&s;e methods worthy noting on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, except the very &s;imple &s;till contrived ex|tempore by Capt. Chapman, and made from &s;uch materials as are to be found on board every &s;hip, great or &s;mall. This was a common pot with a wooden lid of the u&s;ual form, in the center of which a hole was bored to receive per|pendicularly a &s;hort wooden tube, made with an inch and half auger, which perpendicular tube received at it's top, and at an acute angle, another tube of wood al&s;o, which de&s;cended till it joined a third, of pewter, made by rolling up a di&s;h, and pa&s;&s;ing it obliquely through a ca&s;k of cold water. With this &s;im|ple machine he obtained two quarts of fre&s;h-water an hour, and ob&s;erved, that the expence of fuel would be very trifling, if the &s;till was contrived to &s;tand on the fire along with the &s;hip's boiler.</P>
<P>In 1762, Dr. Lind propo&s;ing to make experiments of &s;everal different mix|tures, fir&s;t di&s;tilled rain-water, which he &s;uppo&s;ed would be the pure&s;t, and then &s;ea-water, without any mixture, which he expected would be the lea&s;t pure, in order to arrange between the&s;e two &s;uppo&s;ed extremes the degree of merit of the &s;everal ingredients he meant to try. "To his great &s;urpri&s;e," as he confe&s;&s;es, the &s;ea-water di&s;tilled without any mixture, was as pure as the rain-water. He pur&s;ued the di&s;covery and e&s;tabli&s;hed the fact, that a pure and potable fre&s;h-water may be obtained from &s;alt-water by &s;imple di&s;til|lation without the aid of any mixture for fining or precipitating it's foreign contents. In 1767, he propo&s;ed an extempore &s;till, which, in fact, was Chap|man's, only &s;ub&s;tituting a gun-barrel in&s;tead of Chapman's pewter tube, and the hand-pump of the &s;hip to be cut in two obliquely, and joined again at an acute angle, in&s;tead of Chapman's wooden tubes bored expre&s;s; or, in|&s;tead of the wooden lid and upright tube, he propo&s;ed a tea-kettle (without It's lid or handle) to be turned bottom upwards over the mouth of the pot, by way of &s;till-head, and a wooden tube leading from the &s;pout to a gun-barrel pa&s;&s;ing through a ca&s;k of water, the whole luted with equal parts of chalk and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> moi&s;tened with &s;alt-water.</P>
<P>With this apparatus of a pot, tea-kettle and gun-barrel, the Dolphin, a 20 gun &s;hip, in her voyage round the world, in 1768, from 56 gallons of &s;ea-water, and with 9lb. of wood and 69lb. of pit-coal, made 42 gallons of good fre&s;h water at the rate of 8 gallons an hour. The Dor&s;et&s;hire, in her pa&s;&s;age from Gibraltar to Mahon, in 1769, made 19 quarts of pure water in 4 hours with 10lb. of wood: And the Slambal, in 1773, between Bombay and Bengal, with a hand-pump, gun-barrel and a pot, of 6 gallons of &s;ea-water made 10 quarts of fre&s;h water in 3 hours.</P>
<P>In 1771, Dr. Irvin, putting together Lind's idea of di&s;tilling without a mixture, Chapman's &s;till, and Dr. Franklin's method of cooling by evapora|tion, obtained a premium of 5000l. from the Briti&s;h parliament. He wet his tube con&s;tantly with a mop in&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing it through a ca&s;k of water: He enlarged its bore al&s;o in order to give a freer pa&s;&s;age to the vapour, and thereby encrea&s;e its quantity by le&s;&s;ening the re&s;i&s;tance or pre&s;&s;ure on the evaporating &s;urface: this la&s;t improvement was his own, it doubtle&s;s contributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of his models; and we may &s;uppo&s;e the enlargement of the tube to be u&s;eful to that point at which the central parts of the vapour, pa&s;&s;ing through it, would begin to e&s;cape conden&s;ation. Lord Mulgrave u&s;ed his method in his voyage towards the North Pole in 1773, making from 34 to 40 gallons of fre&s;h water a day, without any great addition of fuel, as he &s;ays.</P>
<P>M. de Bougainville in his voyage round the world, u&s;ed, very &s;ucce&s;sfully, a &s;till which had been contrived in 1763, by Poy&s;&s;onier, &s;o as to guard again&s;t the water being thrown over from the boiler into the pipe by the agitation of the &s;hip. In this one &s;ingularity, was, that the furnace or fire box was in the middle of the boiler, &s;o that the water &s;urrounded it in contact. This &s;till, however, was expen&s;ive and occupied much room.</P>
<P>Such were the advances already made in the art of obtaining fre&s;h from &s;alt water, when Mr. I&s;aacks, the petitioner, &s;ugge&s;ted his di&s;covery.</P>
<P>As the merit of this could be a&s;certained by experiment only, the Secretary of State a&s;ked the favor of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, Pre&s;ident of the American Phi|lo&s;ophical Society, of Dr. Wi&s;tar, profe&s;&s;or of chemi&s;try in the college of Phi|ladelphia, and Dr. Hutchin&s;on, profe&s;&s;or of chemi&s;try in the univer&s;ity of Penn&s;ylvania, to be pre&s;ent at the experiments. Mr. I&s;aacks fixed the pot of a &s;mall cabou&s;e, with a tin cap and &s;trait tube of tin pa&s;&s;ing obliquely through a ca&s;k of cold water; he made u&s;e of a mixture, the compo&s;ition of which he did not explain, and from 24 pints of &s;ea water, taken up about 3 miles out of the Capes of Delaware at flood tide, he di&s;tilled 22 pints of fre&s;h water in 4 hours, with 20lb. of &s;ea&s;oned pine, which was a little wetted by having lain in the rain.</P>
<P>In a 2d experiment of the 21&s;t of March, performed in a furnace and five gallon &s;till at the college, from 32 pints of &s;ea water he drew 31 pints of fre&s;h water in 7 h. 24 min. with 51lb. of hickory which had been cut about &s;ix months. In order to decide whether Mr. I&s;aacks's mixture contributed in any and what degree to the &s;ucce&s;s of the operation, it was thought proper to repeat his experiment under the &s;ame circum&s;tances exactly, except the omi&s;&s;ion of the mixture. Accordingly on the next day the &s;ame quantity of &s;ea water was put into the &s;ame &s;till, the &s;ame furnace was u&s;ed, and fuel from the &s;ame par|cel. It yielded, as his had done, 31 pints of fre&s;h water in 11 min. more of time and with 10lb. le&s;s of wood.</P>
<P>On the 24th of March Mr. I&s;aacks performed a 3d experiment. For this, a common iron pot of 3 &frac12; gallons was fixed in brick work, and the flue from the hearth wound once round the pot &s;pirally, and then pa&s;&s;ed off up a chim|ney. The cap was of tin, and a &s;trait tin tube of about two inches diameter, pa&s;&s;ing obliquely through a barrel of water, &s;erved in&s;tead of a worm. From 16 pints of &s;ea water he drew off 15 pints of fre&s;h water in 2 h. 55 min. with 3lb. of dry hickory and 8lb. of &s;ea&s;oned pine. This experiment was al&s;o re|peated the next day, with the &s;ame apparatus and fuel from the &s;ame parcel, but without the mixture. Sixteen pints of &s;ea water yielded in like manner 15 pints of fre&s;h, in 1 min. more of time and with half a pound le&s;s of wood. On the whole, it was evident that Mr. I&s;aacks's mixture produced no advantage, ei|ther in the proce&s;s or re&s;ult of the di&s;tillation.</P>
<P>The di&s;tilled water in all the&s;e in&s;tances was found on experiment to be as pure as the be&s;t pump water of the city. Its ta&s;te indeed was not as agreeable, but it was not &s;uch as to produce any di&s;gu&s;t. In fact, we drink in common life, in many places, and under many circum&s;tances, and almo&s;t always at &s;ea, a wor&s;e ta&s;ted, and probably a le&s;s whole&s;ome water.</P>
<P>The obtaining fre&s;h from &s;alt water, was for ages con&s;idered as an important de&s;ideratum for the u&s;e of navigators. The proce&s;s for doing this by &s;imple di&s;tillation is &s;o efficacious, the erecting an extempore &s;till with &s;uch uten&s;ils as are found on board of every &s;hip is &s;o practicable, as to authorize the a&s;&s;ertion, that this de&s;ideratum is &s;atisfied to a very u&s;eful degree. But though this has been done for upwards of 30 years, though its reality has been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the actual experience of &s;everal ve&s;&s;els which have had recour&s;e to it, yet nei|ther the fact nor the proce&s;s is known to the ma&s;s of &s;eamen, to whom it would be the mo&s;t u&s;eful, and for whom it was principally wanted. The Secretary of State is therefore of opinion, that &s;ince the &s;ubject has now been brought under ob&s;ervation; it &s;hould be made the occa&s;ion of di&s;&s;eminating its know|ledge generally and effectually among the &s;eafaring citizens of the United States. The following is one of the many methods which might be propo&s;ed for doing this. Let the clearance for every ve&s;&s;el &s;ailing from the ports of the United States, be printed on a paper, on the back whereof &s;hall be a printed account of the e&s;&s;ays which have been made for obtaining fre&s;h from &s;alt wa|ter, mentioning &s;hortly tho&s;e which have been un&s;ucce&s;sful, and more fully tho&s;e which have &s;ucceeded; de&s;cribing the methods which have been found to an&s;wer for con&s;tructing extempore &s;tills of &s;uch implements as are generally on board of every ve&s;&s;el, with a recommendation, in all ca&s;es where they &s;hall have occa&s;ion to re&s;ort to this expedient for obtaining water, to publi&s;h the re|&s;ult of their trial in &s;ome gazette on their return to the United States, or to communicate it for publication to the office of the Secretary of State, in order that others may, by their &s;ucce&s;s, be encouraged to make &s;imilar trials, and be benefitted by any improvements or new ideas which may occur to them in practice.</P>
