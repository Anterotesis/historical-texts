<P>I will faithfully Tran&s;late a few pa&s;&s;ages out of it.
<Q>The Evil Spirit, has invented and introduced into the World, BALLS, and DANCES, and other Di|verti&s;ements, which the <HI>Reproved</HI> call <HI>Innocent,</HI> but St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> called, <HI>Lugendas Latitius, The Sports which call for Sorrows.</HI></Q></P>
