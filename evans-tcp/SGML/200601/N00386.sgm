<HEAD>To <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Highness William Henrick, Prince of Orange, The most Humble Petition of George Lord Chancellor Jefferies.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Most Humbly Sheweth,</OPENER>
<P>THat your Petitioner who was once <HI>Lord Chancellor</HI> of <HI>England</HI> is now become the lowest of Your Suppliants, and from the first and chiefest Councellor about the Throne, a miserable and dejected Captive in the Tower.</P>
<P>I do not presume to justifie my integrity, that would be an Arrogancy as black as my Crimes; I confess I am as unworthy to Live as <HI>I</HI> am unwil|ling to Dye, and therefore <HI>I</HI> Prostrate my self at the Foot-stool of Your Grace and Clemency, that Fountain of inexhaustible Goodness, wherein Mer|cy only can flow upon so notorious a Delinquent.</P>
<P>To Enumerate my Crimes would be as innumerable as the Enemies <HI>I</HI> have created by them, nor will <HI>I</HI> presume to Profane Your Sacred Ears with so black a Catalogue, whose precious Minutes are more happily im|ployed in weightier Affairs of this Nation, the restitution of the Laws and Liberties. <HI>I</HI> by my base and precipitate Counsels have endeavoured to sub|vert: what could be more Pernicious and Destructive to the <HI>Fundamental Laws</HI> of the Nation than to Establish a Power of Men to Dispence with them what greater inlet to Popery than to take off the Penal Laws and Tests? What deeper stroak to the Protestant Church than to Erect an Ec|clesiastical Court of Commissioners to pull down her Pillars: <HI>I</HI>n all which and many others <HI>I</HI> (to my shame) <HI>I</HI> must confess, <HI>I</HI> have been all along a principal Councellor and Instrument: if Your Highness Please to Pardon all these many Crimes, <HI>I</HI> do Promise to make Restitution by Discovering some <HI>I</HI>ntreagues of State, which may highly advance Your Highnesses In|terest in this Kingdome.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>And Your Petitioner shall ever Pray, &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
