<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE WHALE-FISHERY.</HEAD>
<P>WHALE oil enters, as a raw material, into &s;everal branches of manufacture, as of wool, leather, &s;oap: it is u&s;ed al&s;o in painting, architecture and navigation. But its great con&s;umption is in lighting hou&s;es and cities. For this la&s;t purpo&s;e however it has a powerful competitor in the vegetable oils. The&s;e do well in warm, &s;till weather, but they fix with cold, they extingui&s;h ea&s;ily with the wind, their crop is precarious, depending on the &s;ea&s;ons, and to yield the &s;ame light, a larger wick mu&s;t be u&s;ed, and greater quantity of oil con&s;umed. E&s;timating all the&s;e articles of difference together, tho&s;e employed in lighting cities find their account in giving about 25 per cent. more for whale than for vegetable oils. But higher than this the whale oil, in its pre&s;ent form, cannot ri&s;e; becau&s;e it then becomes more advantageous to the city-lighters to u&s;e others. This competition then limits its price&punc; higher than which no encouragement can rai&s;e it, and becomes, as it were, a law of its nature, but, at this low price; the whale fi&s;hery is the poore&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s into which a mer|chant or &s;ailor can enter. If the &s;ailor, in&s;tead of wages, has a part of what is taken, he finds that this, one year with another, yields him le&s;s than he could have got as wages in any other bu&s;ine&s;s. It is attended too with great ri&s;k, &s;ingular hard&s;hips, and long ab&s;ences from his family. If the voyage is made &s;olely at the expence of the merchant, he finds that, one year with another, it does
<PB N="2" REF="021345_0002_0FB31DC49C987EE0">
not reimbur&s;e him his expences. As, for example, an Engli&s;h &s;hip of 300 ton, and 42. hands brings home, com|munibus annis, after a four months voyage, 25. ton of oil, worth 437l. 10s. &s;terl. but the wages of the officers and &s;eamen will be 400l. The Outfit then and the merchant's profit mu&s;t be paid by the government. And it is accord|ingly on this idea that the Briti&s;h bounty is calculated. From the poverty of this bu&s;ine&s;s then it has happened that the nations, who have taken it up, have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively abandoned it. The Ba&s;ques began it. But, tho' the mo&s;t economical and enterpri&s;ing of the inhabitants of France, they could not continue it; and it is &s;aid they never em|ployed more than 30. &s;hips a year. The Dutch and Han&s;e towns &s;ucceeded them. The latter gave it up long ago tho' they have continued to lend their name to Briti&s;h and Dutch oils. The Engli&s;h carried it on, in competition with the Dutch, during the la&s;t, and beginning of the pre&s;ent century. But it was too little profitable for them in com|pari&s;on with other branches of commerce open to them. In the mean time too the inhabitants of the barren I&s;land of Nantucket had taken up this fi&s;hery, invited to it by the whales pre&s;enting them&s;elves on their own &s;hore. To them therefore the Engli&s;h relinqui&s;hed it, continuing to them, as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, the importation of their oils into England duty free, while foreigners were &s;ubject to a duty of 18l. 5s. &s;terl. a ton. the Dutch were enabled to continue it long, becau&s;e, 1. They are &s;o near the northern fi&s;hing grounds, that a ve&s;&s;el begins her fi&s;hing very &s;oon after &s;he is out of port. 2. They navigate with more eco|nomy than the other nations of Europe. 3. Their &s;eamen are content with lower wages: and 4. their merchants with a lower profit on their capital. Under all the&s;e favorable circum&s;tances however, this branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, after long langui&s;hing, is at length nearly extinct with them. It is
<PB N="3" REF="021345_0003_0FB31DC64FF51540">
&s;aid they did not &s;end above half a dozen &s;hips in pur|&s;uit of the whale this pre&s;ent year. The Nantuckois then were the only people who exerci&s;ed this fi&s;hery to any extent at the commencement of the late war. Their country, from its barrenne&s;s, yielding no &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, they were obliged to &s;eek it in the &s;ea which &s;urrounded them. Their economy was more rigorous than that of the Dutch. Their &s;eamen, in&s;tead of wages, had a &s;hare in what was taken. This induced them to fi&s;h with fewer hands, &s;o that each had a greater dividend in the profit. It made them more vigilant in &s;eeking game, bolder in pur&s;uing it, and par|cimonious in all their expences. London was their only market. When therefore, by the late revolution, they became aliens in great Britain, they became &s;ubject to the alien duty of 18l. 5s. the ton of oil, which being more than equal to the price of the common whale oil, they were obliged to abandon that fi&s;hery. So that this people, who before the war had employed upwards of 300 ve&s;&s;els a year in the whale fi&s;hery, (while great Bri|tain had her&s;elf never employed one hundred) have now almo&s;t cea&s;ed to exerci&s;e it. But they &s;till had the &s;eamen, the mo&s;t important material for this fi&s;hery; and they &s;till retained the &s;pirit of fi&s;hing: &s;o that at the ree&s;tabli&s;hment of peace they were capable in a very &s;hort time of reviving their fi&s;hery in all its &s;plendor. The Briti&s;h government &s;aw that the moment was critical. They knew that their own &s;hare in that fi&s;hery was as nothing. That the great ma&s;s of fi&s;hermen was left with a nation now &s;eparated from them: that the&s;e fi&s;hermen however had lo&s;t their ancient market, had no other re&s;ource within their country to which they could turn, and they hoped therefore they might, in the pre&s;ent moment of di&s;tre&s;s, be decoyed over to their e&s;tabli&s;hments, and be added to the ma&s;s of their &s;eamen. To effect this they offered extravagant advantages
<PB N="4" REF="021345_0004_0FB31DC7CFC283F0">
to all per&s;ons who &s;hould exerci&s;e the whale fi&s;hery from Briti&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hments. But not counting with much confi|dence on a long connection with their remaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the continent of America, fore&s;eeing that the Nantuckois would &s;ettle in them preferably, if put on an equal footing with tho&s;e of great Britain, and that thus they might have to purcha&s;e them a &s;econd time, they confined their high offers to &s;ettlers in Great Britain. The Nantuckois, left without re&s;ource by the lo&s;s of their market, began to think of removing to the Briti&s;h dominions: &s;ome to Nova Scotia, preferring &s;maller advantages, in the neighbour|hood of their ancient country and friends; others to great Britain po&s;tponing country and friends to high premiums. A ve&s;&s;el was already arrived from Halifax to Nantucket to take off &s;ome of tho&s;e who propo&s;ed to remove; two families had gone on board and others were going, when a letter was received there, which had been written by Mon&s;ieur le Marquis de la Fayette to a gentleman in Bo&s;ton, and tran&s;mitted by him to Nantucket. The purport of the letter was to di&s;&s;uade their accepting the Briti&s;h propo&s;als, and to a&s;&s;ure them that their friends in France would en|deavour to do &s;omething for them. This in&s;tantly &s;u&s;pended their de&s;ign: not another went on board, and the ve&s;&s;el returned to Halifax with only the two families.</P>
<P>In fact the French Government had not been inattentive to the views of the Briti&s;h, nor in&s;en&s;ible of the cri&s;is. They &s;aw the danger of permitting five or &s;ix thou&s;and of the be&s;t &s;eamen exi&s;ting to be transferred by a &s;ingle &s;troke to the marine &s;trength of their enemy, and to carry over with them an art which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed almo&s;t exclu&s;ively. The counterplan which they &s;et on foot was to tempt the Nantuckois by high offers to come and &s;ettle in France. This was in the year 1785. The Briti&s;h however had in their favour a &s;amene&s;s of language, religion, laws, habits
<PB N="5" REF="021345_0005_0FB31DC9531B6350">
and kindred. 9 families only, of 33 per&s;ons in the whole came to Dunkirk; &s;o that this project was not likely to prevent their emigration to the Engli&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hments, if nothing el&s;e had happened.</P>
<P>France had effectually aided in detaching the U. S. of America from the <HI>force</HI> of Great Britain. But as yet they &s;eemed to have indulged only a &s;ilent wi&s;h to detach them from her <HI>commerce.</HI> They had done nothing to induce that event. In the &s;ame year 1785, while M. de Calonne was in treaty, with the Nantuckois, an e&s;timate of the com|merce of the U. S. was &s;ubmitted to the count de Ver|gennes, and it was &s;hewn that, of 3. millions of pounds &s;terling to which their exports amounted, one third might be brought to France and exchanged again&s;t her produc|tions and manufactures advantageou&s;ly for both nations, provided the ob&s;tacles of prohibition, monopoly, and duty were either done away or moderated as far as circum|&s;tances would admit. A committee, which had been ap|pointed to inve&s;tigate a particular one of the&s;e &s;ubjects, was thereupon in&s;tructed to extend its re&s;earches to the whole, and &s;ee what advantages and facilities the Govern|ment could offer for the encouragement of a general com|merce with the United States. The Committee was com|po&s;ed of per&s;ons well &s;killed in commerce; and, after labouring a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly for &s;everal months, they made their report: the re&s;ult of which was given in the letter of his Maje&s;ty's Comptroller General of the 2d of Octob. 1786. wherein he &s;tated the principles which &s;hould be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for the future regulation of the commerce between France and the United States. It was become tolerably evident, at the date of this letter, that the terms offered to the Nantuckois would not produce their emigration to Dunkirk; and that it would be &s;afe&s;t in every event to offer &s;ome other alternative which might prevent their
<PB N="6" REF="021345_0006_0FB31DD05B4A5BD0">
acceptance of the Briti&s;h offers. The obvious one was to open the port of France to their oils, &s;o that they might &s;till exerci<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">e their fi&s;hery, remaining in their native country, and find a new market for its produce in&s;tead of that which they had lo&s;t. The article of Whale oil was accordingly di&s;tingui&s;hed, in the letter of M. de Calon|ne, by an immediate abatement of duty, and promi&s;e of further abatement after the year 1790. This letter was in&s;tantly &s;ent to America, and bid fair to produce there the effect intended, by determining the fi&s;hermen to carry on their trade from their own homes, with the advantage only of a free marker in France, rather than remove to Great Britain where a free market and great bounty were offered them. An Arret was &s;till to be prepared to give legal &s;anction to the letter of M. de Calonne. M. Lam|bert, with a patience and a&s;&s;iduity almo&s;t unexampled, went through all the inve&s;tigations nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf that the conclu&s;ions of the Committee had been ju&s;t. Frequent conferences on this &s;ubject were held in his pre&s;ence; the Deputies of the Chambers of Commerce were heard, and the re&s;ult was the Arret of Dec. 29. 1787. confirming the abatements of duty pre&s;ent and fu|ture, which the letter of Octob. 1786. had promi&s;ed, and re&s;erving to his Maje&s;ty to grant &s;till further favours to that production, if on further information he &s;hould find it for the intere&s;t of the two Nations.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h had now begun to deluge the markets of France with their whale oils: and they were enabled by the great premiums given by their Government to un|der&s;ell the French fi&s;herman, aided by feebler premiums, and the American aided by his poverty alone. Nor is it certain that the&s;e &s;peculations were not made at the ri&s;k of the Briti&s;h Government, to &s;uppre&s;s the French and American fi&s;hermen in their only market. Some remedy
<PB N="7" REF="021345_0007_0FB31DD226781948">
&s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary. Perhaps it would not have been a bad one to &s;ubject, by a general law, the merchandize of every nation and of every nature to pay additional duties in the ports of France exactly equal to the premiums and draw|backs given on the &s;ame merchandi&s;e by their own go|vernment. This might not only counteract the effect of pre|mium in the in&s;tance of whale oils, but attack the whole Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem of bounties and drawbacks by the aid of which they make London the center of commerce for the whole earth. A le&s;s general remedy, but an effectual one, was to prohibit the oils of all <HI>European</HI> nations: the treaty with England requiring only that &s;he &s;hould be treated as well as the mo&s;t favoured <HI>European</HI> nation. But the remedy adopted was to prohibit all oils without ex|ception.</P>
<P>To know how this remedy will operate we mu&s;t con|&s;ider the quantity of whale oil which France con&s;umes annually, the quantity &s;he obtains from her own fi&s;hery; and if &s;he obtains le&s;s than &s;he con&s;umes, we are to con|&s;ider what will follow this prohibition.</P>
<P>The annual con&s;umption of France, as &s;tated by a per&s;on who has good opportunities of knowing it, is as follows.</P>

<P><PB N="8" REF="021345_0008_0FB31DD3E9261690">Other calculations, reduce the con&s;umption to about half this. It is treating the&s;e with &s;ufficient re&s;pect to place them on an equal footing with the e&s;timate of the per&s;on before alluded to, and to &s;uppo&s;e the truth half way between them. We will call then the pre|&s;ent con&s;umption of France only 60,000 quintals, or 3750 ton a year. This con&s;umption is increa&s;ing fa&s;t as the practice of lighting cities is becoming more general, and the &s;uperior advantages of lighting them with whale oil are but now beginning to be known.</P>
<P>What do the fi&s;heries of France furni&s;h? &s;he has em|ployed this year 15. ve&s;&s;els in the Southern, and 2 in the Northern fi&s;hery, carrying 4500 tons in the whole or 265 each on an average. The Engli&s;h &s;hips, led by Nantuckois as well as the French, have as I am told never averaged, in the Southern fi&s;hery, more than one fifth of their burthen, in the be&s;t year. The 15 &s;hips of France, according to this ground of calculation, and &s;uppo&s;ing the pre&s;ent to have been one of the be&s;t years, &s;hould have brought, one with another, one fifth of 265 tons, or 53 tons each. But we are told they have brought near the double of that, to wit 100 tons each and 1500 tons in the whole. Sup|po&s;ing the 2. Northern ve&s;&s;els to have brought home the cargo which is common from the Northern fi&s;hery, to wit, 25 tons each, the whole produce this year will then be 1550 tons. This is 5&frac12; months provi&s;ion or two fifths of the annual con&s;umption. To furni&s;h for the whole year would require 40 &s;hips of the &s;ame &s;ize, in years as for|tunate as the pre&s;ent, and 85 communibus annis, 44 tons, or one &s;ixth of the burthen, being as high an average as &s;hould be counted on, one year with another: and the number mu&s;t be increa&s;ed with the increa&s;ing con&s;umption. France then is evidently not yet in a condition to &s;upply
<PB N="9" REF="021345_0009_0FB31DD603A52AA0">
her own wants. It is &s;aid indeed &s;he has a large &s;tock on hand un&s;old occa&s;ioned by the Engli&s;h competition. 33,000 quintals, including this year's produce, are &s;poken of. This is between 6. and 7. months provi&s;ion: and &s;up|po&s;ing, by the time this is exhau&s;ted, that the next year's &s;upply comes in, that will enable her to go on 5. or 6. months longer; &s;ay a twelvemonth in the whole. But, at the end of the twelvemonth, what is to be done? The Manufactures depending on this article cannot main|tain their competition again&s;t tho&s;e of other countries, if deprived of their equal means. When the alternative then &s;hall be pre&s;ented of letting them drop, or opening the ports to foreign whale oil, it is pre&s;umable the latter will be adopted, as the le&s;&s;er evil. But it will be too late for America: her fi&s;hery, annihilated during the late war, only began to rai&s;e its head on the pro&s;pect of market held out by this country. Cru&s;hed by the Arret of Sept. 28. in its fir&s;t feeble effort to revive, it will ri&s;e no more. Expeditions, which require the expence of the outfit of ve&s;&s;els, and from 9. to 12 months navigation, as the Southern fi&s;hery does, mo&s;t frequented by the Americans, cannot be undertaken in &s;ole reliance on a market which is opened and &s;hut from one day to another, with little or no warning. The Engli&s;h alone then will remain to furni&s;h the&s;e &s;upplies, and they mu&s;t be re|ceived even from them. We mu&s;t accept bread from our enemies, if our friends cannot furni&s;h it. This comes exactly to the point to which that government has been looking. She fears no rival in the whale fi&s;hery but Ame|rica. Or rather, it is the whale fi&s;hery of America of which &s;he is endeavouring to po&s;&s;e&s;s her&s;elf. It is for this object &s;he is making the pre&s;ent extraordinary efforts by bounties and other encouragements: and her &s;ucce&s;s &s;o far is very flattering. Before the war &s;he had not 100 ve&s;&s;els
<PB N="10" REF="021345_0010_0FB31DD79476A1D8" MS="y">
in the whale trade, while America employed 309. in 1786. Great Britain employed 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">1 ve&s;&s;els, in 1787&punc; 286. in 1788. 314. yearly the ancient American number; while the latter is fallen to about 80. They have ju&s;t changed places then, England having gained exactly what America has lo&s;t. France by her ports and markets holds the balance between the two contending parties, and gives the victory, by opening and &s;hutting them, to which &s;he plea&s;es. We have &s;till precious remains of &s;eamen educated in this fi&s;hery, and capable by their poverty, their boldne&s;s and addre&s;s, of recovering it from the Engli&s;h, in &s;pite of their bounties. But this Arret endangers the transferring to Great Britain every man of them who is not invincibly attached to his native &s;oil. There is no other nation in pre&s;ent condition to maintain a competition with Great Britain in the whale fi&s;hery. The expence at which it is &s;upported on her part &s;eems enormous. 255 ve&s;&s;els, of 75 4<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">6 tons, employed by her this year in the Northern fi&s;hery, at 42 men each; and 59. in the Southern at 18 men each makes 11,772 men. The&s;e are known to have co&s;t the government 15l. each, or 176,580l. in the whole, and that to employ the principal part of them from 3. to 4. months only. The Northern &s;hips have brought home 20. and the Southern 60. tons of oil on an average, making 8,640 tons, every ton of oil then has co&s;t the government 20l. in bounty. Still, if they can beat us out of the field and have it to them&s;elves, they will think their money well employed. If France undertakes &s;olely the competition again&s;t them, &s;he mu&s;t do it at equal expence. The trade is too poor to &s;upport it&s;elf. The 85 &s;hips nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply even her pre&s;ent con&s;umption, bountied as the Engli&s;h are, will require a &s;acrifice of 1,285,200 livres a year, to maintain 3,570 &s;eamen, and that a part of the year only. And if &s;he will pu&s;h it to 12,000
<PB N="11" REF="021345_0011_0FB31DD997246C58" MS="y">
men in competition with England, &s;he mu&s;t &s;acrifice, as they do, 4. or 5. millions a year. The &s;ame number of men might, with the &s;ame bounty, be kept in as con&s;tant employ carrying &s;tone from Bayonne to Cherburg, or coal from Newca&s;tle to Havre, in which navigations they would be always at hand, and become as good &s;eamen. The Engli&s;h con&s;ider among their be&s;t &s;ailors tho&s;e em|ployed in carrying coal from Newca&s;tle to London. France cannot expect to rai&s;e her fi&s;hery, even to the &s;upply of her own con&s;umption, in one year or in &s;everal years. Is it not better then, by keeping her ports open to the U. S. to enable them to aid in maintaining the field again&s;t the common adver&s;ary, till &s;he &s;hall be in condition to take it her&s;elf, and to &s;upply her own wants? Otherwi&s;e her &s;upplies mu&s;t aliment that very force which is keeping her under. On our part, we can never be dangerous com|petitors to France. The extent to which we can exerci&s;e this fi&s;hery is limited to that of the barren i&s;land of Nan|tucket, and a few &s;imilar barren &s;pots; its duration to the plea&s;ure of this government, as we have no other market.</P>
<P>A material ob&s;ervation mu&s;t be added here. Sudden vici&s;&s;itudes of opening and &s;hutting ports, do little injury to merchants &s;ettled on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, watching for the opening, like the return of a tide, and ready to enter with it. But they ruin the adventurer who&s;e di&s;tance re|quires 6 months notice. Tho&s;e who are now arriving from America, in con&s;equence of the Arret of Dec. 29. will con&s;ider it as the fal&s;e light which has led them to their ruin. They will be apt to &s;ay that they come to the ports of France by invitation of that Arret, that the &s;ub&s;equent one of Sept. 28. which drives them from tho&s;e ports, founds it&s;elf on a &s;ingle principle, viz. 'that the prohibi|tion of foreign oils is the mo&s;t u&s;eful encouragement which
<PB N="12" REF="021345_0012_0FB31DDAAA0F3640">
can be given to that branch of indu&s;try.' They will &s;ay that, if this be a true principle, it was as true on the 29th. of Dec. 1787. as on the 28th. of Sept. 1788. it was then weighed again&s;t other motives, judged weaker, and over|ruled, and it is hard it &s;hould be now revived to ruin them.</P>
<P>The Refinery for whale oil lately e&s;tabli&s;hed at Rouen, &s;eems to be an object worthy of national attention. In order to judge of its importance, the different qualities of whale oil mu&s;t be noted. Three qualities are known in the Ame|rican and Engli&s;h markets. 1. That of the Spermaceti whale. 2. Of the Groenland whale. 3. Of the Brazil whale. 1. The Spermaceti whale found by the Nantucketmen in the neighbourhood of the we&s;tern I&s;lands, to which they had gone in pur&s;uit of other whales, retired thence to the coa&s;t of Guinea, afterwards to that of Brazil, and begins now to be be&s;t found in the latitude of the cape of good hope, and even of cape Horn. He is an active, fierce ani|mal and requires va&s;t addre&s;s and boldne&s;s in the fi&s;herman. The inhabitants of Brazil make little expeditions from their coa&s;t, and take &s;ome of the&s;e fi&s;h. But the Americans are the only di&s;tant people who have been in the habit of &s;eek|ing and attacking them in numbers. The Briti&s;h however, led by the Nantuckois whom they have decoyed into their &s;ervice, have begun this fi&s;hery. In 1785 they had 18 &s;hips in it; in 1787, 38: in 1788, 54. or as &s;ome &s;ay 64. I have calculated on the middle number 59. &s;till they take but a very &s;mall proportion of their own demand. We furni&s;h the re&s;t. Theirs is the only market to which we carry that oil, becau&s;e it is the only one where its properties are known. It is luminous, re&s;i&s;ts coagulation by cold to the 41&s;t. degree of Farenheit's thermometer, and 4th. of Reaumur's, and yields no &s;mell at all. It is u&s;ed therefore within doors to lighten &s;hops, and even in the riche&s;t hou&s;es
<PB N="13" REF="021345_0013_0FB31DE0F125DD08">
for antichambers, &s;tairs, galleries, &amp;c. it &s;ells at the Lon|don market for treble the price of common whale oil. This enables the adventurer to pay the duty of 18l. 5s. &s;terl. the ton, and &s;till to have a living profit. Be&s;ides the ma&s;s of oil produced from the whole body of the whale, his head yields 3. or 4. barrels of what is called head-matter, from which is made the &s;olid Spermaceti u&s;ed for medicine and candles. This &s;ells by the pound at double the price of the oil. The di&s;advantage of this fi&s;hery is that the &s;ailors are from 9. to 12. months ab&s;ent on the voyage, of cour&s;e they are not at hand on any &s;udden emergency, and are even liable to be taken before they know that a war is begun. It mu&s;t be added on the &s;ubject of this whale, that he is rare, and &s;hy, &s;oon abandoning the grounds where he is hunted. This fi&s;hery being le&s;s lo&s;ing than the other, and often profitable, will occa&s;ion it to be &s;o thronged &s;oon, as to bring it on a level with the other. It will then require the &s;ame expen&s;ive &s;upport, or to be abandoned.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Groenland whale oil is next in quality. It re&s;i&s;ts coagulation by cold to 36&deg;. of Farenheit and 2&deg;. of Reau|mur; but it has a &s;mell in&s;upportable within doors, and is not luminous. It &s;ells therefore in London at about 16l. the ton. This whale is clum&s;y and timid, he dives when &s;truck, and comes up to breathe by the fir&s;t cake of ice, where the fi&s;hermen need little addre&s;s or courage to find and take him. This is the fi&s;hery mo&s;tly frequented by Euro|pean nations; it is this fi&s;h which yields the &s;in in quantity, and the voyages la&s;t about 3. or 4. months.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third quality is that of the &s;mall Brazil whale. He was originally found on the coa&s;t of Nantucket, and fir&s;t led that people to this pur&s;uit. He retired fir&s;t to the banks of Newfoundland, then to the we&s;tern i&s;lands; and is now found within &s;oundings on the coa&s;t of Brazil, during the months of December, January, February and March.
<PB N="14" REF="021345_0014_0FB31DE2CF3FA408">
This oil chills at 50&deg;. of Farenheit and 8&deg;. of Reaumur, is black and offen&s;ive, worth therefore but 13l. the ton in London. In warm &s;ummer nights however it burns better than the Groenland oil.</P>
<P>The qualities of the oils thus de&s;cribed, it is to be added that an individual has di&s;covered methods 1. of converting a great part of the oil of the &s;permaceti whale into the &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance called &s;permaceti, heretofore produced from his head alone. 2. Of refining the Groenland whale oil, &s;o as to take from it all &s;mell and render it limpid and luminous, as that of the &s;permaceti whale. 3. of curd|ling the oil of the Brazil whale into tallow, re&s;embling that of the beef, and an&s;wering all its purpo&s;es. This per&s;on is engaged by the company which has e&s;tabli&s;hed the Refinery at Rouen: their works will co&s;t them half a million of livres, will be able to refine all the oil which can be u&s;ed in the kingdom, and even to &s;upply foreign markets.&mdash;The effect of this refinery then would be 1. to &s;upplant the &s;olid &s;per|maceti of all other nations by theirs of equal quality and lower price. 2. to &s;ub&s;titute, in&s;tead of &s;permaceti oil, their black whale oil, refined, of equal quality and lower price. 3. to render the worthle&s;s oil of the Brazil whale equal in value to tallow: and 4. by accomodating the&s;e oils to u&s;es, to which they could never otherwi&s;e have been applied, they will extend the demand beyond its pre&s;ent narrow limits to any &s;upply which can be furni&s;hed, and thus give the mo&s;t effectual encouragement and exten&s;ion to the whale fi&s;hery. But the&s;e works were calculated on the Arret of Dec. 29. which admitted here freely and fully the pro|duce of the American fi&s;hery. If confined to that of the French fi&s;hery alone, the enterpri&s;e may fail for want of matter to work on.</P>
<P>After this review of the whale fi&s;hery as a Political in&s;titution, a few con&s;iderations &s;hall be added on its
<PB N="15" REF="021345_0015_0FB31DE452EF2330">
produce as a ba&s;is of Commercial exchange between France and the United States. The di&s;cu&s;&s;ions it has undergone on former occa&s;ions, in this point of view, leaves little new to be now urged.</P>
<P>The United-States not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing mines of the precious metals, they can purcha&s;e nece&s;&s;aries from other nations &s;o far only as their produce is received in exchange. Without enumerating our &s;maller articles, we have three of principal importance, proper for the French market, to wit, Tobacco, whale oil, and rice. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t important is Tobacco. This might furni&s;h an exchange for 8. millions of the productions of this country: but it is under a monopoly, and that not of a mercantile, but a financiering company, who&s;e intere&s;t is to pay in money, and not in merchandi&s;e; and who are &s;o much governed by the &s;pirit of &s;implifying their purcha&s;es and proceedings, that they find means to elude every endeavour on the part of government to make them diffu&s;e their purcha&s;es among the merchants in general. Little profit is derived from this then as an article of exchange for the produce and manu|factures of France. Whale oil might be next in importance; but that is now prohibited. American Rice is not yet of great, but it is of growing con&s;umption in France, and being the only article of the three which is free, it may become a principal ba&s;is of exchange. Time and trial may add a fourth, that is, timber. But &s;ome e&s;&s;ays, rendered un&s;uccesful by unfortunate circum&s;tances, place that at pre&s;ent under a di&s;credit, which it will be found hereafter not to have merited. The Engli&s;h know its value, and were &s;upplied with it before the war. A &s;pirit of ho&s;tility, &s;ince that event, led them to &s;eek Ru&s;&s;ian rather than Ame|rican &s;upplies. A new &s;pirit of ho&s;tility has driven them back from Ru&s;&s;ia, and they are now making contracts for American timber. But of the three articles before men|tional,
<PB N="16" REF="021345_0016_0FB31DE7F1C11F20">
proved by experience to be &s;uitable for the French market, one is prohibited, one under monopoly, and one alone free, and that the &s;malle&s;t and of very li|mited con&s;umption. The way to encourage purcha&s;ers is to multiply their means of payment. Whale oil might be an important one. In one &s;cale is the intere&s;t of the millions who are lighted, &s;hod or clothed with the help of it, and the thou&s;ands of labourers and manufacturers who would be employed in producing the articles which might be given in exchange for it, if received from America. In the other &s;cale are the intere&s;ts of the adventurers in the whale fi&s;hery; each of whom indeed, politically con&s;idered may be of more importance to the &s;tate than a &s;imple labourer or manufacturer: but to make the e&s;timate with the ac|curacy it merits, we &s;hould multiply the numbers in each &s;cale into their individual importance, and &s;ee which pre|ponderates.</P>
<P>Both governments have &s;een with concern that their commercial intercour&s;e does not grow as rapidly as they would wi&s;h. The &s;y&s;tem of the United States is to u&s;e neither prohibitions nor premiums. Commerce there re|gulates it&s;elf freely, and a&s;ks nothing better. Where a government finds it&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of undertaking that regulation, it would &s;eem that it &s;hould conduct it as an intelligent merchant would: that is to &s;ay, invite cu&s;tomers to purcha&s;e, by facilitating their means of payment, and by adapting goods to their ta&s;te. If this idea be ju&s;t, government here has two operations to at|tend to, with re&s;pect to the commerce of the United States. 1. To do away, or to moderate, as much as po&s;|&s;ible, the prohibitions and monopolies of their materials for payment. 2. To encourage the in&s;titution of the prin|cipal manufactures which the nece&s;&s;ities, or the habits of their new cu&s;tomers call for. Under this latter head a
<PB N="17" REF="021345_0017_0FB31DE98FC31C48">
hint &s;hall be &s;ugge&s;ted which mu&s;t find its apology in the motive from which it flows, that is, a de&s;ire of promoting mutual intere&s;ts and clo&s;e friend&s;hip. 600,000 of the labour|ing poor of America, comprehending &s;laves under that denomination, are clothed in three of the &s;imple&s;t ma|nufactures po&s;&s;ible, to wit, Oznabrigs, Plains, and Duffel blankets. The fir&s;t is a linen, the two la&s;t woollens. It happens too that they are u&s;ed exactly by tho&s;e who cul|tivate the tobacco and rice and in a good degree by tho&s;e employed in the whale fi&s;hery. To the&s;e manufactures they are &s;o habituated, that no &s;ub&s;titute will be received. If the ve&s;&s;els which bring tobacco, rice and whale oil, do not find them in the ports of delivery, they mu&s;t be &s;ought where they can be found. That is in England at pre&s;ent. If they were made in France they would be gladly taken in exchange there. The quantities annually u&s;ed by this de&s;cription of people, and their value are as follows.

It would be difficult to &s;ay how much &s;hould be added for the con&s;umption of inhabitants of other de&s;criptions. A great deal &s;urely. But the pre&s;ent view &s;hall be confined to the one de&s;cription named&punc; 7 millions of livres, are 9 millions of days work of tho&s;e who rai&s;e card, &s;pin and weave the wool and flax; and at 300 working days to the year, would maintain 30,000 people. To introduce the&s;e &s;imple manufactures &s;uppo&s;e government to give 5 per cent. on the value of what &s;hould be exported of them, for 10. years to come. If none &s;hould be exported, nothing would be to be paid: but on the other hand, if the
<PB N="18" REF="021345_0018_0FB31DEB569109E0">
manufactures, with this encouragement &s;hould ri&s;e to the full demand, it will be a &s;acrifice of 351,000 livres. a year for 10. years only, to produce a perpetual &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for more than 30,000 people, (for the demand will grow with our population) while &s;he mu&s;t expend perpetually 1,285,000 livres. a year to maintain the 3,570 &s;eamen, who would &s;upply her with whale oil: that is to &s;ay, for each &s;eaman as much as for 30. labourers and manufacturers.</P>
<P>But to return to our &s;ubject, and to conclude.</P>
<P>Whether then we con&s;ider the Arret of Sept. 28. in a political or a commercial light, it would &s;eem that the U. S. &s;hould be excepted from its operation. Still more &s;o when they invoke again&s;t it the amity &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two nations, the de&s;ire of binding them together by every po&s;&s;ible intere&s;t and connection, the &s;everal acts in favour of this exception, the dignity of legi&s;lation which admits not of changes backwards and forwards, the in|tere&s;ts of commerce which require &s;teady regulations, the a&s;&s;urances of the friendly motives which have led the king to pa&s;s the&s;e acts, and the hope that no cau&s;e will ari&s;e to change either his motives or his mea&s;ures towards us.</P>
