I mu&s;t de&s;ire thee (<HI>Reader</HI>) upon occa&s;ion to take the trouble of turning to the <HI>Errata,</HI> where I hope thou will find the mo&s;t material collected. The chief occa&s;ion of there being &s;o many errours, was, the Printer being a man of another nation and language, as al&s;o not bred to that employment, con&s;equent|ly &s;omething unexpert both in language and calling, and the corrector's not being &s;o frequently at hand as the ca&s;e required, all which I de&s;ire thou would&s;t favourably con&s;ider.</P>
<P>The Intent of publi&s;hing this, was chiefly to prevent any from being deceived, and al&s;o to undeceive tho&s;e that may have been already deceived by this unfair, man's abu&s;ive book; for &s;uch it is, and as &s;uch, let it be added to the Catalogue of tho&s;e many envious and abu&s;ive writings, that have been &s;ent forth in|to the world, from time to time, to hinder the &s;preading of truth, and the progre&s;s of Gods people in the way of it: all which will &s;urely be accounted for one day, and not wit&s;tanding all which, the truth remains the &s;ame, and I am &s;atisfied will more and more &s;pread it &s;elf, and prevail, in and upon and the hearts &s;pirits of people, notwith&s;tanding the vari|ous and re&s;tle&s;s attempts of its Oppo&s;ers, to hinder it. And as the way of its working, is to clean&s;e and purify mankind in &s;oul, body and &s;pirit, and make them fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> temples for God to dwell in, by virtue of his holy &s;pirit in us and al&s;o entitle us effectually, to partake of the great and un|&s;peakable benefit, that accrues to mankind, by that one offering of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, on the tree of the Cro&s;s: So it is highly nece&s;&s;ary that we more and more come to experience this clean&s;ing work to be wrought in us, in order to be entitu|led to tho&s;e afore &s;aid benefits.

<HEAD>SATANS HARBINGER ENCOUNTERED &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>Before I come to the <HI>Book</HI> it &s;elf, I &s;hall touch a little upon the <HI>Preface,</HI> and begin with an expre&s;&s;ion or <HI>Da|niel Leeds's,</HI> which runs thus.
<Q>It is my real belief, That the <HI>Quakers</HI> at fir&s;t came forth in life and power, and made a good beginning.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;wer. Did they &s;o? How comes it then to pa&s;s, that the fir&s;t In&s;truments of that good beginning in life and power, as <HI>G. Fox, G. Whitehead, E. Bourough, R. Habberth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rn, Is. Pennington &amp;c.</HI> and their antient works and Writings, mu&s;t be thus brought upon the &s;tage, by this <HI>Dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el Leeds</HI> him&s;elf, even in this very book, endeavouring thereby to prove their doctrine fal&s;e, incon&s;i&s;tent, and little le&s;s than a meer heap of confu&s;ion? Can &s;uch things be an effect of <HI>life and power?</HI> And if he &s;ay, They lo&s;t that <HI>life and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">wer</HI> again, before tho&s;e books were written: It may then be ob&s;erved, how in the &s;ame Page he in&s;inuates, as if the loo|&s;ing of it again,
<Q>was through their contending with one another about trifles and Ceremonies, in&s;tituting this and that order, and getting into form &amp;c.</Q>
Whereas it is well known, that many of the above named Friends Books were written before the <HI>In&s;titution</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Orders,</HI> (as he calls them). Be&s;ides, I find in a Paper entitulad <HI>A breif Admoni|tion &amp;c.</HI> (delivered to Friends here at the yearly meeting in the year 1696., Which as I am credibly informed) was written by <HI>Daniel Leeds,</HI> there being al&s;o the two letters of his name, with two letters more &s;ub&s;chribed to it) after having expre&s;&s;ed what an healthy flouri&s;hing Country this was about eight years before, this pa&s;&s;age, viz
<Q>Doubtle&s;s it might have &s;o continued, if the kernell of life and love had not took wing &amp;c.</Q>
Now hence I ob&s;erve, That (accor|ding to this aknoledgement (for &s;uch it is implicitely at
<PB N="2" REF="000948_0005_0FAD9643A1E0B2F0">
lea&s;t) the kernel of life and love had not took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng be|fore the Year 1688; yet mo&s;t of the books he quotes were written long before that time. But &s;urely no orderly &s;en&s;ible man will imagine, that order and form among&s;t God's Peo|ple, will occa&s;ion the life and powet to withdraw, whil&s;t the power is not denyed: Is not <HI>God a God of order?</HI> And doth not the <HI>Apo&s;tel</HI> &s;ay to the <HI>Corinthians? Let all things be done decently and in order</HI> 1 Cor. 14:40. Moreover if <HI>the life and love took Wings,</HI> but about or &s;ince the jear 1688, how could tho&s;e <HI>Orders</HI> which were e&s;tabli&s;hed above twen|ty years before be the occa&s;ion of it? Again, what Orders have We that they di&s;own? Have We Montly meetings? So have they. Have We Yearly meetings? So have they? Have We Womens meetings? <HI>Daniel Leeds</HI> &s;aith,
<Q>Tho&s;e Meetings are certainly of &s;ervice in Deeds of Charity and Ho&s;pitality, page 66.</Q></P>
<P>But to proceed, he concludes that page and begins the next with this pa&s;&s;age viz,
<Q>When my intentions were fir&s;t &s;et on this en&s;uing work, I had taken <HI>G, K's.</HI> books in e|qually with the re&s;t or el&s;e I &s;hould have been partial as <HI>Caleb Pa&s;ey</HI> has been [<HI>being blinded with prejudice,</HI> as his term is] in only faulting <HI>G. K's</HI> books, but not his Oppo|&s;ers; but as I proceeded on, at lenght I found <HI>G. K.</HI> (ac|cording to the example of good men in all Ages) has pu|blickly acknowledged him&s;elf guilty of Errors in divers of his former books, and promi&s;ed a correction of the &s;ame; and now of late we have his Retractation come over in Print.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;w. A meer flam: For among all the contradictions that we have charged and proved upon him, he has been &s;o far from retracting any part of them, though they contra|dict his pre&s;ent doctrine, that he boa&s;ts in the very Retract|ing book it &s;elf, <HI>That for the mo&s;t part they are the &s;ounde&s;t pa&s;&s;ages in all his book, and that he can &s;hew a good con&s;i&s;tency of them with his pre&s;ent faith.</HI> See pa. 42:43. And now, &s;ince <HI>Daniel Leeds</HI> in the clo&s;e of his Preface a&s;&s;erts his <HI>pro|ceedings</HI> in his book <HI>to be hone&s;t and &s;incere</HI>; I appeal to all impartial people Since <HI>G.

K's. Univer&s;al free Grace of the Go&s;pel,</HI> in pa. 117 I found, that he there would not grant, <HI>That outward know|ledge, or the knowledge of Chri&s;t in the outward was univer|&s;ally nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation</HI>; which I pre&s;ently &s;hewed to an hone&s;t Friend, and then a late Friend of his, at <HI>Philadelphia</HI>; and when I came to town again, he told me, he had &s;hew|ed <HI>G.

<PB N="4" REF="000948_0007_0FAD9649E390B898">
<HI>Quakers,</HI> and that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a primitive &s;tamp too, would have for&s;aken him, and his notions al&s;o. Well, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n he finds out a way to glo&s;s over this place, and would have us believe, That when he denyed, as afore&s;aid, the knowled|ge of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the outward to be univer&s;ally nece&s;&s;ary to &s;al|vation, his meaning was, that it was not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation begun; as if that difference betwixt our Friends, whom <HI>G. K.</HI> was then vindicating, and other people, was about &s;alvation began only: Yet lea&s;t that would not do, We mu&s;t al&s;o be told of a di&s;tinction, betwixt the expre&s;s, and the implicite knowledge of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and that the expre&s;s knowledge was not univer&s;ally nece&s;&s;ary, yet the implicite knowledge was. Now the&s;e things put me into a farther &s;earch, into both his former and latter books, and in his former I &s;till found, where he was concerned to treat of the &s;ubject, he alvvais denyed that knovvledge to be e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, particularly in his <HI>Umiver&s;al free Grace &amp;c., p.</HI> 117, and <HI>Light of truth triumphant, p.</HI> 6. By his former books, I mean &s;uch as bear date before the year 1681. or thereabouts, Which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be about the time that he wrote (as he acknowledged) 199 of the 200 queries concerning the <HI>Revolution of humane &s;ouls &amp;c.</HI> But by his latter books it appears, that he is clearly changed in principle as to the point of doctrine; and I finding things thus, and al&s;o how he was receded from his principles in &s;ome other matters, wherein he differed with Friends, as About the &s;ufficiency of the Light without &s;omething el&s;e, and about Preachers being Magi&s;trares, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the confu&s;ed work he had made about his &s;trange notions of the Re&s;ur|rection, as in my &s;aid book is &s;hovvn: This I &s;ay, Was the occa&s;ion of my Writing that book, that thereby I might &s;hevv to them, e&s;pecially to the mo&s;t &s;incere among&s;t them, hovv he vvent about to deceive them, by drilling them on, and per&s;vvading them, <HI>we could never prove, he was chaing|ed in his Principles,</HI> as his ovvn vvords are, &s;ee, <HI>Some Fundamental T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uths p:</HI> 13.

Behold now the man; for if this be true, what need he now at a pinch have put out his book of <HI>Retraetations</HI>: why he was driven to it, he mu&s;t either do it, or el&s;e &s;ome of his followers might have fallen out with him about it; for &s;ome of them were not &s;atis|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed with him in that re&s;pect; Nay, if we can beleive this D.

But there is one thing more, which I am &s;ure he ought not only to Retract, now his hand is in, but al&s;e deeply to lament, and that is; His &s;o abu&s;ing his poor bigotted followers Cas I have already hin|ted) in his thus deluding them, by &s;o often per&s;wading them, at the fir&s;t, that he was not changed in his Principles; and when he hath done this, I know not, but as to this point, he may pretty well pa&s;s, for &s;uch a kind of an hone&s;t man, as is &s;o vvith good looking to: But before he dos thus much, I do not &s;ee hovv he can be afforded the appellation. And novv to conclude, I do &s;ay; that &s;uppo&s;e I had &s;een, and took no|tice of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in our Friends books, which might &s;eem to me like incon&s;i&s;tencys, e&s;pecially in relation to things not then in controver&s;y, I do not look upon my &s;elf equally obliged to expo&s;e them, as I did his, which were &s;o palpable, and done for the rea&s;on afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>The next thing I &s;hall take noice of, is, <HI>Daniel Leedss'</HI> pretences in this his <HI>Preface</HI> now be fore me; that
<Q>His pro|ceeding, here in to expo&s;e and publi&s;h what follows [in his book] was by emotion heavenly.</Q>
Yet I que&s;tion not to prove him in his thus doing not only an <HI>Accu&s;er,</HI> but a very fal&s;e <HI>Accu&s;er of the Brethren</HI>; which to be &s;ure could not proceed from a motion heavenly, and &s;car&s;e think he can be &s;o infatuated, as to think it did, unle&s;s his meaning be; That he was influenced in this action, by the motion of the &s;tarrs, that are placed in that firmament of huven, and
<PB N="6" REF="000948_0009_0FAD964B28144100">
yet if his meaning be &s;uch, it will by no means de&s;erve the credit, that was given to his Idle prediction, publi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed in his Almanack for the jear 1695, where he &s;aith;

and forgeries he is guilty of in the beforegoing.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to his <HI>third Chapter,</HI> which I find much like his former, it being grounded upon his not being willing to di&s;tingui&s;h, in a&s;criptural &s;en&s;e, between Chri&s;t as he was from the beginning, and as he came in the body in the fulne&s;s of time.</P>
<P>As for what he here &s;aith of <HI>John Whitehead,</HI> I refer the Reader to <HI>Tho. Ellwood's</HI> book, Called <HI>Truth Defended</HI> &amp;c. p. 124.</P>
<P>As for his saying, That "The true <HI>Chr&s;tians</HI> believe that the true Chri&s;t hath a body of fle&s;h and bones &amp;c. To this I an&s;wer, That how, or after what manner, Chri&s;t's body is now in heaven I &s;hall by no means undertake to determine' it being (I believe) above the capacity of us Mortals &s;o to do: But I &s;hall tell <HI>D.L.</HI> that he hereby brings his great friend <HI>G.K.</HI> under his cen&s;ure of not being a true <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>; for <HI>G.K.</HI> expre&s;ly &s;aith of Chri&s;t's body, that,
<Q>It is no more a body of fle&s;h blood and bone, but a pure Aethereal heavenly body, &s;ee <HI>Way ca&s;t up</HI> p. 131 not retracted.</Q></P>
<P>Then, for his bantering <HI>W: P.</HI> about his calling Chri&s;t's body holy: &s;aying Can this be other than hypocrisy? "for as is noted at <HI>Numb</HI> 49 50, he holds the body to be earthly and peri&s;hing, I would have the Reader note, it proceeds from <HI>W: P</HI>'s vindicating this &s;aying &s;o <HI>J&s;aac "Peningtons</HI>' That which Chri&s;t took upon him was but the garment of our nature, which is of an earthly and peri&s;hing nature.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, That Chri&s;t's body was a holy body ac|cording to <HI>W.</HI>P. Surely <HI>D.L.</HI> will not deny; Yet that it was the garment of our nature is not (me thinks) hard to make out: For it is &s;aid <HI>Heb:</HI> 2:14 <HI>For as much then as the children are partakers of fle&s;h and blood, he al&s;o him|&s;elf likewi&s;e took part of the &s;ame</HI> [Mark of the &s;ame] Now how it is the &s;ame, if not of the &s;ame nature, for my part I know not; though Chri&s;t defiled not his nature

by &s;in, as we have done ours, is Certain; and therefore a holy body according to <HI>W&middot;P:</HI> Yet in as much as <HI>he took on him</HI> the &s;eed of Abraham, he &s;urely took on him our nature, unle&s;s the &s;eed of <HI>Abraham</HI> be not of our nature, and that this is the garment which <HI>Is.

<P>I come next to touch upon one pa&s;&s;age in his <HI>Chap.</HI> 4, where he thinks he hath gotten I know not what advan|tage again&s;t <HI>W: P,</HI> He cites <HI>VV: P</HI>'s. <HI>Rea&s;on again&s;t Rai|ling</HI> p. 165. where <HI>D.</HI>L. &s;aies "W.P. ju&s;tifies and declares that he abides by there ill names given by <HI>E.

<P><PB N="44" REF="000948_0047_0FAD968C8637A108">I <HI>an&s;wer</HI> Here he hath very unfairly left out that part of <HI>VV: P</HI>'s. words which would unque&s;tionably have &s;hewn &s;uch men he there di&s;creyd to be no <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>; For <HI>VV: P.</HI> being there treating concerning and &s;peaking again&s;t per|&s;ecutors, he hath it thus, viz,

For in&s;tance G.K. in his Antichti&s;ts and Saducees detected hath be&s;towed many hard names upon me, as Antichri&s;t, Saducee or rather Athei&s;t, Bold Ignorant, Miller Philo&s;opher &amp;c. Now &s;ince there is great probability that he doth not mean me to be one of tho&s;e upon who&s;e account he hath retracted the hard names given; So al&s;o any of his former Opponents to whom he hath given hard names may &s;ay I know not that he means me to be one of them who have not (in his Judg|ment) de&s;erved them, and now although he &s;eems to make an acknowledgment and blame him&s;elf for be&s;towing hard names on divers, yet &s;ince he names none of tho&s;e diver what &s;ati&s;faction to me is his pretended retraction in this more than his charging them on me in his former, and what &s;incerity doth he manife&s;t in it?

<P>Upon prui&s;al of his 5th. Chapter about prophe&s;ies I find not above one that he hath mentioned which hath failed: For tho&s;e he &s;peaks of who have of late prophe&s;ied again&s;t &s;everal towns and places, I never heard that any prefixed a time, nor otherwaies than upon condition, viz unle&s;s they did repent, which whether there was not &s;o much repen|tance in &s;o many of them as might move the Lord to a farther compa&s;&s;ion on them is &s;urely more than this D: L: knows.</P>

<P>In his 6. Chapter he flings out his &s;coffs and taunts about Infallible di&s;cerning, and in particular reflects upon our Friends about <HI>Delaware,</HI>
<Q>that they want this &s;pirit of di&s;cerning, and to prove it in&s;tances the ca&s;e of <HI>Robert Ewer.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now to this I &s;ay, Though <HI>G: F.</HI> (as quoted by him) &s;peaks of <HI>a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t's having an infallible di&s;cer|ning of a mans &s;tate and condition,</HI> Yet he doth not &s;ay it is without any re&s;pect had to the fruit he brings forth: And (Chri&s;t &s;aith <HI>Matt.</HI> 7:16 <HI>By their fruits ye &s;hall know them.</HI> So that I do believe, to know any mans condition without this token, mu&s;t be an extraordinary and particular gift of God; But by the fruits brought forth, I do believe, according to the words of Chri&s;t, people may be known, and that infallibly too, for what is &s;hort of that, is not properly knowledge, but barely conjecture. And as for <HI>Robert Ewer</HI> There was not &s;o near an unity bewixt him and our Friends, a con&s;iderable time before that bu&s;ine&s;s of that Woman at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> was talked of, as <HI>D: L.</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly imagine; But it is not the Churches place to di&s;|own any Member, before proof be made, of &s;ome evil done by him or her, and to prove what I &s;ay, I hope I have an Au|thor very &s;ufficient in <HI>D: L</HI>'s eye, for it is no le&s;s per&s;on than his great friend <HI>G: K,</HI> who in his late book of <HI>Retracta|tions</HI> &amp;c. (not yet retracted again that I heare of) hath it thus in p. 3;

Well then; &s;o far as matter of fact was thus made appear again&s;t <HI>Robert Ewer,</HI> he was dealt with according to Go&s;pel order too. But for D: L's telling us, of
<Q>Late ill example of divers of our Preachers, e&s;pecially of their being unlawfully concerned with women:</Q>
He &s;hould either have let us know who they were, or el&s;e have been &s;ilent about it; for for my part I know them not, but do beleive it is a great &s;lander.</P>
<P>In his p. 64 he banters <HI>W: P.</HI> for &s;aying,
<Q>We a&s;cribe not infallibility to men, but to the grace of God, and to men &s;o far as they are led by it:</Q>
Here upon he makes this reflection, viz
<Q>Behould Reader, and note this Rhe|torick well! For are not other Profe&s;&s;ors, yea, all men in the world &s;o far infallible, as well as <HI>Quakers.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w</HI>: Yes. But does not D: <HI>L.</HI> know, that there are multitudes of men in the world, who are &s;o far from being led by the infallible grace, or &s;pirit of God, that they make a mock at, and deride it, and &s;urely, &s;uch are very far from being infallibly led by it. But what need was there for <HI>D:</HI> L. to &s;ay [<HI>as well as Quakers</HI>] &s;ince <HI>W: P.</HI> according to <HI>D: L</HI>'s own citation, doth not re&s;trict infallibility only to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> but to men indefinitely, for &s;aith he [<HI>and to men &s;o far as they are led by it</HI>].</P>
<P>As for his telling, how friends "admit none to travel upon Truth's acount without certificates, I think it is very com|mendable; but pa&s;ting by his mocking, viz, his &s;aying, it is "to help our &s;pirit of di&s;cerning, I take notice of what he &s;aith of <HI>G</HI>: W. quoting him out of <HI>Quakers plainne&s;s,</HI> thus

So that the word <HI>God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">man</HI> is not what G: <HI>W:</HI> objects a|gain&s;t, but <HI>God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">man</HI> born of <HI>Mary</HI>; which much alters the ca&s;e; for to &s;ay, God as well as man was born of <HI>Mary,</HI> was too like the Pope's calling <HI>Mary</HI> the Mother of God; for that which was <HI>conceived in her</HI> was <HI>of the holy gho&s;t</HI> but not the holy gho&s;t. <HI>Matt.</HI> 1:20.</P>

But not one word of his being God man.
