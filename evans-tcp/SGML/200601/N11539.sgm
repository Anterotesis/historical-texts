<P>THE &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies of NEW-JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA and VIRGINIA, having re|fered to the Congre&s;s a re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e of Commons of GREAT-BRITAIN, which re&s;olution is in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><HI>Lunae, 20<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> die Feb.</HI> 1775.</P>
<P><HI>The Hou&s;e in a Committee on the American papers. Motion made, and que&s;tion propo&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THAT it is the opinion of this Committee, that when the General Council and A&s;&s;embly, or General Court of any of his Maje&s;ty's provinces, or colonies in Ame|rica, &s;hall propo&s;e to make provi&s;ion, according to the condition, circum&s;tance, or &s;ituation of &s;uch province or colony, for contributing their proportion to the common defence, (&s;uch proportion to be rai&s;ed under the au|thority of the General Court, or General A&s;&s;embly of &s;uch province or colony, and di&s;po&s;able by Parliament) and &s;hall engage to make provi&s;ion also, for the &s;up|port of the civil government, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in &s;uch province or colony, it will be proper if &s;uch propo&s;al &s;hall be approved by his Maje&s;ty and the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, and for &s;o long as &s;uch provi&s;ion &s;hall be made accordingly, to forbear in re|&s;pect
<PB N="2" REF="014583_0002_0F9384DBB7059240">
of &s;uch province or colony to lay any duty, tax, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, or to impo&s;e any farther duty, tax, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, except only &s;uch duties as it may be expedi|ent to continue to levy or impo&s;e, for the regulation of commerce; the net produce of the duties la&s;t mentioned, to be carried to the account of &s;uch province or colony re&s;pectively.</HI></P>
<P>The Congre&s;s took the &s;aid re&s;olution into con&s;i|deration, and are thereupon of opinion.</P>
<P>THAT the colonies of America are entitled to the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive privilege of giving and granting their own money: that this involves a right of deliberating whether they will make any gift, for what purpo&s;es it &s;hall be made, and what &s;hall be it's amount: and that it is a high breach of this privilege for any body of men, ex|traneous to their con&s;titutions, to pre&s;cribe the purpo&s;es for which money &s;hall be levied on them, to take to them&s;elves the authority of judging of their conditions, circum&s;tances and &s;ituations, and of determining the amount of the contribution to be levied.</P>
<P>THAT as the colonies po&s;&s;e&s;s a right of appro|priating their gifts, &s;o are they entitled at all times to enquire into their application, to &s;ee that they be not wa&s;ted among the venal and corrupt for the purpo&s;e of undermining the civil rights of the giv|ers, nor yet be diverted to the &s;upport of &s;tanding armies, incon&s;i&s;tent with their freedom and &s;ub|ver&s;ive of their quiet. To propo&s;e therefore, as this re&s;olution does, that the monies given by the colonies &s;hall be &s;ubject to the di&s;po&s;al of parlia|ment
<PB N="3" REF="014583_0003_0F9384DBF1160658">
alone, is to propo&s;e that they &s;hall relinqui&s;h this right of enquiry, and put it in the power of others to render their gifts ruinous, in proportion as they are liberal.</P>
<P>That this privilege of giving or of witholding our monies is an important barrier again&s;t the un|due exertion of prerogative, which, if left altoge|ther without controul, may be exerci&s;ed to our great oppre&s;&s;ion; and all hi&s;tory &s;hews how effica|cious is it's interce&s;&s;ion for redre&s;s of grievances and re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of rights, and how improvi|dent it would be to part with &s;o powererful a me|diator.</P>
<P>WE are of opinion that the propo&s;ition contain|ed in this re&s;olution is unrea&s;onable and in&s;idious: unrea&s;onable, becau&s;e, if we declare we accede to it, we declare without re&s;ervation, we will purcha&s;e the favor of parliament, not knowing at the &s;ame time at what price they will plea&s;e to e&s;timate their favor: it is in&s;idious, becau&s;e, individual colo|nies, having bid and bidden again, till they find the avidity of the &s;eller too great for all their powers to &s;atisfy; are then to return into oppo&s;ition, di|vided from their &s;i&s;ter colonies whom the mini&s;ter will have previou&s;ly detached by a grant of ea&s;ier terms, or by an artful procra&s;tination of a defini|tive an&s;wer.</P>
<P>THAT the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the exerci&s;e of their pre|tended power of taxation being expre&s;sly made commen&s;urate with the continuance of our gifts, the&s;e mu&s;t be perpetual to make that &s;o. Where|as
<PB N="4" REF="014583_0004_0F9384DD04258DD0">
no experience has &s;hewn that a gift of perpetual revenue &s;ecures a perpetual return of duty or of kind di&s;po&s;ition. On the contrary, the parliament it&s;elf, wi&s;ely attentive to this ob&s;ervation, are in the e&s;tabli&s;hed practice of granting their &s;upplies from year to year only.</P>
<P>DESIROUS and determined as we are to con&s;ider in the mo&s;t dipa&s;&s;ionate view every &s;eeming ad|vance towards a reconciliation made by the Briti&s;h parliament, let our brethren of Britain reflect what would have been the &s;acrifice to men of free &s;pirits had even fair terms been proffered, as the&s;e in&s;idious propo&s;als were with circum&s;tances of in|&s;ult and defiance. A propo&s;ition to give our mo|ney, accompanied with large fleets and armies, &s;eems addre&s;&s;ed to our fears rather than to our free|dom. With what patience would Britons have received articles of treaty from any power on earth when borne on the point of a bayonet by military plenipotentiaries?</P>
<P>WE think the attempt unnece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e upon us by force or by threats our proportional contri|butions to the common defence, when all know, and them&s;elves acknowledge we have fully contri|buted, whenever called upon to do &s;o in the cha|racter of freemen.</P>
<P>WE are of opinion it is not ju&s;t that the colonies &s;hould be required to oblige them&s;elves to other contributions, while Great-Britain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a mo|nopoly of their trade. This of it&s;elf lays them under heavy contribution. To demand there|fore,
<PB N="5" REF="014583_0005_0F9384DF010B5D50">
additional aids in the form of a tax, is to de|mand the double of their equal proportion, if we are to contribute equally with the other parts of the empire, let us equally with them enjoy free commerce with the whole world. But while the re&s;trictions on our trade &s;hut to us the re&s;ources of wealth, is it ju&s;t we &s;hould bear all other burthens equally with tho&s;e to whom every re&s;ource is open?</P>
<P>WE conceive that the Briti&s;h parliament has no right to intermeddle with our provi&s;ions for the &s;up|port of civil government, or admini&s;tration of ju&s;|tice. The provi&s;ions we have made are &s;uch as plea&s;e our&s;elves, and are agreeable to our own cir|cum&s;tances: they an&s;wer the &s;ub&s;tantial purpo&s;es of government and of ju&s;tice, and other purpo&s;es than the&s;e &s;hould not be an&s;wered. We do not mean that our people &s;hall be burthened with op|pre&s;&s;ive taxes, to provide &s;inecures for the idle or the wicked, under colour of providing for a civil li&s;t. While parliament pur&s;ue their plan of civil government within their own juri&s;diction, we al&s;o hope to pur&s;ue ours without mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>WE are of opinion the propo&s;ition is altogether un&s;atisfactory, becau&s;e it imports only a &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion of the mode, not a renunciation of the pre|tended right to tax us: becau&s;e too it does not pro|po&s;e to repeal the &s;everal Acts of Parliament pa&s;|&s;ed for the purpo&s;es of re&s;training the trade and altering the form of government of one of our colonies; extending the boundaries and chang|ing the government of Quebec; enlarging the juri&s;diction of the courts of Admiralty and vice Admiralty; taking from us the rights of trial
<PB N="6" REF="014583_0006_0F9384DF86B2F740">
by a jury of the vicinage in ca&s;es affecting both life and property; tran&s;porting us into other coun|tries to be tried for criminal offences; exempting by mock-trial the murderers of coloni&s;ts from puni&s;hment; and quartering &s;oldiers on us in times of profound peace. Nor do they renounce the power of &s;u&s;pending our own legi&s;latures, and of legi&s;lating for us them&s;elves in all ca&s;es what&s;o|ever. On the contrary, to &s;hew they mean no di&s;continuance of injury, they pa&s;s acts, at the very time of holding out this propo&s;ition, for re|&s;training the commerce and fi&s;heries of the pro|vinces of New-England, and for interdicting the trade of other colonies with all foreign nations and with each other. This proves unequivocally they mean not to relinqui&s;h the exerci&s;e of indi&s;crimi|nate legi&s;lation over us.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, this propo&s;ition &s;eems to have been held up to the world, to deceive it into a be|lief that there was nothing in di&s;pute between us but the <HI>mode</HI> of levying taxes; and that the par|liament having now been &s;o good as to give up this, the colonies are unrea&s;onable if not perfect|ly &s;ati&s;fied: whereas in truth, our adver&s;aries &s;till claim a right of demanding <HI>ad libitum,</HI> and of tax|ing us them&s;elves to the full amount of their de|mand, if we do not comply with it. This leaves us without any thing we can call property. But, what is of more importance, and what in this pro|po&s;al they keep out of &s;ight, as if no &s;uch point was now in conte&s;t between us, they claim a right to alter our charters and e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, and leave us without any &s;ecurity for our lives or liberties.
<PB N="7" REF="014583_0007_0F9384E05FB2F5B0">
The propo&s;ition &s;eems al&s;o to have been calculated more particularly to lull into fa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;ecurity our well-affected fellow &s;ubjects on the other &s;ide the water, till time &s;hould be given for the operation of tho&s;e arms, which a Briti&s;h mini&s;ter pronounced would in&s;tantaneou&s;ly reduce the "cowardly" &s;ons of America to unre&s;erved &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.
