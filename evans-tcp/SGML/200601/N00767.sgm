<PB N="5" REF="000925_0005_0FAD3CF041F023B8">
are to be found: We find them a|mong the <HI>Gentiles</HI> al&s;o: <HI>Rahab</HI> was one of them. Now, what was this <HI>Rahab?</HI> What was the <HI>Action</HI> of <HI>Rahab</HI>? What was the <HI>I&s;&s;ue</HI> of the <HI>Action</HI>?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The <HI>Per&s;on</HI> famous for <HI>Faith,</HI> was, <HI>The Harlot Rahab.</HI> The word that fir&s;t &s;ignified an <HI>Ho&s;te&s;s,</HI> did come al&s;o to &s;ignify an <HI>Harlot.</HI> In tho&s;e Debauch'd Countreys, and tho&s;e Bruti&s;h Ages, <HI>Women</HI> that kept pub|lick Hou&s;es of Entertainment made them to be <HI>Bawdy</HI> Hou&s;es as well as <HI>Drinking</HI> Hou&s;es.

The <HI>Rites</HI> of <HI>Idola|try</HI> were nouri&s;hed, and maintained
<PB N="6" REF="000925_0006_0FAD3CF1ACB98620">
by the Snares of <HI>Uncha&s;tity.</HI> The women that &s;erved the <HI>Temples,</HI> where men did <HI>Sacrifice to Idols,</HI> were provided al&s;o for their <HI>Fornication.

And it was not on any Ill De&s;ign, that the Hone&s;t men of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> went into the Hou&s;e of a woman of that quality; But God had prepared the <HI>Heart</HI> of the poor woman for their coming to her <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> Even a <HI>Faith</HI> of Gods fulfilling to His <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the Great Promi&s;e of His <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> to come.

<P>Secondly. The <HI>Action</HI> whereto <HI>Faith</HI> inclined this per&s;on, was that of <HI>Receiving the Spies with peace.</HI> It was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a <HI>Young Faith,</HI> which had

She not only covered and concealed the <HI>Spies,</HI> and notably a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed their E&s;cape, when &s;he might have gained the Princes Favour by Betraying them, and &s;he ran the Haz|ard of her very Life by not Betraying them: but al&s;o upon her Examinati|on, &s;he told an <HI>Officious Lye</HI> to pre|&s;erve them.

The way of <HI>Man</HI> u&s;ually is This: If there be &s;ome little <HI>Infir|mity</HI> in any One, we Proclame it, we Magnify it, we Aggravate it, with all the Reproach imaginable: And ra|ther than fail, we will Stigmatize that for an <HI>Infirmity,</HI> which rather is an <HI>Excellency.</HI> On the other &s;ide, Behold the way of <HI>God!
