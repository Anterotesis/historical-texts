The &s;hewing of the face to any is therefore frequently u&s;ed for kindne&s;s, freedom, and familiarity; and
<PB N="13" REF="000901_0012_0FAC9A6CA34F2770">
the hiding of it is a token of e&s;tranged|ne&s;s and di&s;plea&s;ure&punc; 2 Sam. 14.24. <HI>let him not &s;ee my face</HI>: Hence <HI>David</HI> prays for Gods favour in &s;uch words, P&s;al. 4 6. <HI>Lift up the light of thy Countenance upon us.</HI>
Gods hiding of his face then from his Creatures, intends his withdrawing from them the&s;e &s;en&s;ible or experimental di&s;|coveries of his benignity to them, which &s;ometimes they enjoyed; or his withol|ding from them tho&s;e manife&s;tations of him&s;elf which they long for, and which he hath been ordinarily wont to be&s;tow upon others: for though hiding do pro|perly intend <HI>a withdrawing out of &s;ight,</HI> yet it al&s;o includes in it <HI>a keeping out of &s;ight,</HI> and not &s;hewing one &s;elf.

That the&s;e withdrawings are not from Gods hatred, but his love; they are ready to &s;u&s;pect this, and &s;ay, as P&s;al. 77.7, 8, 9. <HI>will the Lord ca&s;t off for ever&punc; &amp;c.</HI> but it is their <HI>infirmity, ver&s;e</HI> 10. they think, becau&s;e he hides him&s;elf, he loves them not; but indeed he doth therefore &s;o hide, becau&s;e he loveth them. <HI>Zion</HI> thinks that now &s;he is <HI>forgotten and for&s;a|ken</HI>; but God a&s;&s;ures her that it is far
<PB N="32" REF="000901_0031_0FAC9A7AE26C6890">
otherwi&s;e, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 49.14, 15. and God is grieved that his people &s;hould think there is any defect or decay in his love, be|cau&s;e he &s;o carries to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. That though God love them, yet he may be angry at them, and withdraw in anger. <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Hatred</HI> are contra|ries, but <HI>Anger</HI> is &s;ubordinated, and may be employed by either of them; there is an anger of love as well as of hatred: A Father hath a dear love for his Child, but he may be very angry at him, and manife&s;t it too in &s;evere tokens. God can be provoked, &s;o as to withdraw from his own; and he &s;o declares, I&s;a. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">4.8. <HI>In a little wrath I hid my face from thee.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Yet this anger is managed by love, and &s;hall work accordingly. Gods di&s;|plea&s;ure at his Children &s;hall do nothing but what love directs; if then he hides away from them in anger, it is becau&s;e he &s;eeth it is be&s;t for them: it &s;hall not extingui&s;h, no, nor dimini&s;h, no, nor &s;o much as intermit the operation of his love towards them, but &s;hall always do loves work: when therefore he afflicts, it is in <HI>faithfulne&s;s,</HI> as P&s;al. 119.75.</P>
<P N="4">4. That God may withdraw from his
<PB N="33" REF="000901_0032_0FAC9A7BA3AA7288">
people when he is not angry; they in|deed have cau&s;e to be afraid of &s;ome provocation given, and accordingly to make diligent &s;earch: but God &s;ome|times withdraws from them, when there is no &s;pecial provocation given him&punc; <HI>Job</HI> had great <HI>de&s;ertions,</HI> as hath been ob&s;erved, and yet God him&s;elf te&s;tifieth of him, that there was <HI>none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man,</HI> Job 1.8. and the Church could &s;ay, in P&s;al. 44.17. <HI>all this is come upon us, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have we not forgotten thee, nor dealt fal&s;ly in thy Covenant.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That there is ever &s;omething in the condition of his people, for which the&s;e withdrawings are &s;utable; they are in &s;uch a po&s;ture as is be&s;t for the glory of God, and their everla&s;ting welfare, that they met with &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ation. And now let us take notice what that is, that &s;o we may be helped to di&s;cover Gods &s;pecial de&s;ign herein; and this may be reduced to three heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. God doth it for their cha&s;ti&s;ement and amendment. <HI>Divine Corrections</HI> are one part of Gods di&s;pen&s;ations to his people here, Heb. 12.6. <HI>whom the Lord loveth he cha&s;teneth, and &s;courgeth every &s;on

whom he receives</HI>: and the aim of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the doing of them good; let us then ob&s;erve how he makes the&s;e de&s;ertions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rve to this purpo&s;e in a few particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Gods Children are &s;ometimes over|taken with &s;ins that both di&s;honour him, and wound them; if they were not lia|ble to folly, they would not need Cor|rection. Nor is their folly re&s;trained to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;er infirmities,</HI> but &s;ometimes breaks out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto <HI>more bold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</HI> God pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mes &s;uch a thing may be, and for that rea&s;on threatens a <HI>Rod</HI> in ca&s;e, P&s;al. 89.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>Gods name is bla&s;phe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed</HI> by what they do, as it was by <HI>Da|vids</HI> folly. 2 Sam. 12.14. and their own <HI>bones are broken,</HI> as he complains, P&s;al. 51.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. there are &s;ome &s;uch wounds as the&s;e, which the mo&s;t eminent Saints on Scrip|ture record have gotten to them&s;elves, though more &s;eldome.</P>
<P N="2">2. And they very often grow dull and remi&s;s in the exerci&s;e of their graces: Carnal Concupi&s;cence that remains in them, and the occa&s;ions and temptations they meet with in the world, are apt to cool their gracious frames, and bring them into deadne&s;s, &s;o that though Grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> alive at the root, yet it doth not flou|ri&s;h;
<PB N="35" REF="000901_0034_0FAC9A7D23A23910">
there is fire on the hearth, but it is covered with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbers; they grow drow|&s;y and lukewarm, it was &s;o with the <HI>Spou&s;e,</HI> Cant. 5.3. and with the <HI>Church of Sardis,</HI> Rev: 3. begin. and u&s;ually their being expo&s;ed to the fore-mentioned &s;ins begins here, it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>David</HI> was in &s;uch a po&s;ture, when he was &s;urprized on <HI>the hou&s;e top,</HI> 2 Sam. 11. begin.</P>
<P N="3">3. The glory of God, and their good, are concerned in their recovery. It is not con&s;i&s;tent with either of the&s;e for them to be left always in &s;uch a conditi|on as they have brought them&s;elves into by &s;uch things. Gods name &s;uffers not a little by the former, nor is there any way for them to repair the injury done to it, but by a &s;oaking repentance; and their work lies by by both, and there is no progre&s;s made in the bu&s;ine&s;s where|in they are to work out their own &s;alva|tion. For the reparation therefore of both the&s;e, it is requi&s;ite, that they be made to &s;ee and lament their folly, and be rowzed up to their bu&s;ine&s;s: and <HI>Gods Covenant Faithfulne&s;s</HI> engageth him to do this for them.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="36" REF="000901_0035_0FAC9A7DE308E710">4. Many times other means to re|claim them are un&s;ucce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. God u&s;e|eth other cour&s;es, and they remain &s;tu|pid and &s;encele&s;s. <HI>David</HI> doubtle&s;s lived under the enjoyment of, and attendance upon the Ordinances of God, and yet he is &s;tupid and remorcele&s;s till the <HI>Prophet</HI> cometh. It is too awfully ob|&s;ervable that Godly men, under &s;ome eminent decays, content them&s;elves with formality, and feel not their malady, till God comes in &s;ome more awful way to bring them to this &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence God exerci&s;eth them with &s;uch De&s;ertions for their awakening, humbling and hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing: and when he &s;o doth, and toucheth their Con&s;ciences, then they re&s;ent them, and are brought to them&s;elves.

When <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> came to his beloved with &s;weet allurements, &s;he wantonly neglected and rejected them, but when he <HI>put in his finger,</HI> and left a touch-behind, and then with|drew, now &s;he is quickned, her grace begins to &s;tir and revive, and &s;he re&s;ts not till &s;he hath gotten the &s;ight of him again. <HI>Cant.</HI> 5.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="37" REF="000901_0036_0FAC9A7EA33CE3A8">2. God doth it for the exerci&s;e and tryal of their Grace.

<P N="1">1. God hath put his Graces into his people for exerci&s;e, in which he is to be glorified.

This is the <HI>fruitfulne&s;s</HI> by which Chri&s;t tells us, that <HI>His Father is glorified, Joh.</HI> 15.8.</P>
<P N="2">2. This exerci&s;e of Grace is made illu&s;trious when it is put to the tryal. Grace is like gold, which is di&s;covered by the tryal of it, both as to the reality and excellency of it: and what &s;aith he? <HI>Job</HI> 23.10. <HI>When he hath tryed me, I &s;hall come forth as gold.</HI> By the&s;e the truth of Grace is made manife&s;t; if there be any activity in it, it will now &s;how it &s;elf: and the &s;treng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h of it will now be prov|ed, whether it be weak or &s;trong.

<P N="3"><PB N="38" REF="000901_0037_0FAC9A7F7257E8B0">3. Temptations are &s;uited for this Tryal. And here by Temptations I un|der&s;tand all &s;orts of afflictions.

<P N="4">4. De&s;ertions belong to the&s;e Temp|tations. And indeed grace is never &s;o put to the proof, as when God hides his face from us. To believe in a with|drawing God, to be following hard after him, when he &s;eems to be going away from us; to hold him the fa&s;ter, when he offers to knock our hands off; to re|&s;olve with him, <HI>Job</HI> 13.15. <HI>Though he &s;lay me, I will put my trust in him.</HI> And him, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 8.17. <HI>I will wait for the Lord,

<P N="5">5. God hereby lets them know their own weakne&s;s, to humble them. When God withdraws, the corrupt part &s;tirs: unbelief is ready to di&s;cover it &s;elf, im|patience to break forth in un&s;uitable ex|pre&s;&s;ions, and carriages; the Chri&s;tian who before thought, what he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould do, if a&s;&s;ailed, now finds him&s;elf to be at a lo&s;s, and ready to &s;ink; &s;ee how <HI>David</HI> expre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf, in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 77&punc; <HI>begin.</HI> as if all were gone; and is made to confe&s;s that it was his <HI>infirmity, Ver&s;e</HI> 10.</P>

<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. That God never de&s;erts his Chil|dren &s;o as he doth wicked men; they indeed may not always di&s;cern it, but he evermore makes a very great difference between the&s;e and tho&s;e.

<P N="1">1. That Gods Soveraignty is to be adored in the&s;e Di&s;pen&s;ations.

<P N="2">2. Yet the De&s;ertion &s;hall la&s;t no lon|ger than till the end of it is attained.

<P N="5">5. God will &s;hew his manifold wi&s;|dom in bringing of his to glory, &amp; hence acts very differently with them in the exerci&s;e or trial of their graces. If God may be glorified by us, that &s;hould &s;a|tisfie us; and in this way he gaineth great glory; hence,</P>

<P N="1">1. Concerning the nature and opera|tion of this trouble, we may fir&s;t take a general de&s;cription of it, and then trace it in the effects which it produceth in the Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="1">1. Of this trouble take this general de&s;cription; <HI>It is the mo&s;t distre&s;&s;ing per|plexity of Soul, in a Child of God, ari&s;ing from his apprehen&s;ion of Gods withdrawing from him.</HI> We before ob&s;erved that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;ed in our <HI>Text</HI> is very emphati|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al&punc; which is engro&s;&s;ed in the de&s;crip|tion, and may be laid forth in the open|ing of it.

<P N="1">1.

<PB N="55" REF="000901_0054_0FAC9A8CE5536B80">
which they give thereunto. We mu&s;t therefore carry in our minds whom it is that we are treating about.</P>
<P N="2">2. We are told whence it is that their trouble proceeds; <HI>viz. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">prehen&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of Gods withdrawing from them.</HI> And here ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. The foundation of this trouble i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the de&s;ertion it &s;elf: it is that which gives being to it. If God &s;hould not withdraw, they would not thus be trou|bled: could they always enjoy the light of his countenance, it would abundant|ly &s;atisfy them, let what el&s;e will befall them. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 23.4. <HI>When I walk through the valley of the &s;hadow of death, I will from no ill, for thou art with me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That which nextly produceth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> trouble is their apprehen&s;ion of this. Sometimes they are in &s;o drow&s;y a frame, that God is hidden, and they are in&s;en|&s;ible of it, and &s;o long it di&s;quiets them not. How long it was thus with <HI>David</HI> we cannot certainly tell, but it was &s;o till the <HI>Prophet</HI> came and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ed him&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Sam.</HI> 12. <HI>begin.</HI> But when once the &s;pi|ritual &s;en&s;e is awakened, and they mi&s;s, and cannot find him, now they are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.

him to give &s;uch a touch on the Con|&s;cience upon his withdrawing, which quickens this &s;en&s;e; &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he found it in, <HI>Cant.</HI> 5.4. <HI>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.</HI> And the rea&s;on is&punc; be|cau&s;e he ever de&s;erts them with a purpo&s;e to return again, and this is in order to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The trouble it &s;elf is a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing perplexity of Soul. We ob&s;erved that the word &s;ignifies &s;uch a Con&s;ternation as leaves a man, in his own apprehen&s;i|on, without coun&s;el or help: he is brought into a labyrinth, and cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e his way out; he can look no way but he is entangled, and this di&s;tracts him; &s;o he complains, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 88.15. <HI>While I &s;uffer thy terrours, I am di&s;tracted.</HI> And we have &s;uch moans, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 31.9, 10. <HI>I am in trouble, mine eye is con&s;umed with grief,</HI> &amp;c.

This fills them with an apprehen|&s;ion of Gods anger, and is terrible to them; and indeed there is not a more fearful token of Gods di&s;plea&s;ure at his Children than when he leaves them to &s;in, and withdraws his Spirit from them; we read, 2 Sam. 24&punc; 1. <HI>the anger of God was kindled against I&s;rael, and he moved David against them, to &s;ay, go number I&s;ra|el and Judah</HI>&punc; How &s;hall they be able to pur&s;ue their work, and obtain the Crown if thus left?

<P N="2">2. When they apprehend God de&s;ert|ing them as to comfort; when he hides the light of a&s;&s;urance from them, and
<PB N="63" REF="000901_0062_0FAC9A92E4045A28">
leaves them in the dark about their &s;pi|ritual e&s;tate, there are the&s;e effects that properly follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. This makes them to call their &s;tate into que&s;tion: There is an <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> which is the ba&s;is of a believers con|&s;olation&punc; and according to the degrees of it, &s;uch is his comfort in it; this is helped by Gods enabling of him to read his own evidences, and to judge of the reality of them, and by his co-wit|ne&s;&s;ing with them. When therefore God witholds this, he is left in the dark about is; and the proper re&s;ult of it is to be afraid whether ever any thing was right in him, whether he hath not all this while deceived him&s;elf, and built on a fal&s;e hope; out of doubt this fear &s;tirred in <HI>David,</HI> when he put up that petition, in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.11. <HI>Ca&s;t me not away from thy pre&s;ence.</HI></P>

and if he &s;hould then be found a cheat, and if <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould &s;ay to him, <HI>I never knew you,</HI> how dreadful will it be? and on this account the <HI>Terrours of God make him afraid</HI>&punc;</P>
<P N="2">2. With re&s;pect to the degrees of the&s;e <HI>De&s;ertions.</HI> God doth not always hide him&s;elf alike, neither as to the graces, nor&punc; as to the comforts of his people: and hence there are divers mea&s;ures of this darkne&s;s, and di&s;tre&s;s which is upon them; the lowe&s;t whereof are terrible, but yet with more activity of faith than the other. Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. If the De&s;ertion be in lower de|grees.</P>
<P N="1">1. It fills him with deep &s;orrow and mourning. Let God be never &s;o little departed, when he knows it, it produceth this, in him, nor can it do le&s;s; it makes him to &s;ay, as P&s;al. 38.6. <HI>I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day long:</HI> grief and bitterne&s;s &s;eizeth him, and it fills his eyes with tears, and his heart with &s;ighing.</P>
<P N="2">2. It rai&s;eth a combat between hope &amp; fear. There is &s;ome &s;tirring of faith, there is al&s;o a great moving of diffidence and di&s;tru&s;t; his heart is full of to&s;&s;ings,
<PB N="65" REF="000901_0064_0FAC9A94631041E0">
he would hope that God will return to him again; and yet he is afraid whether he will or no: fear pre&s;&s;eth him down as an heavy weight, and hope endea|vours to buoy him up again; there is a wre&s;tling, as <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 42. <HI>ult. Why art thou ca&s;t down O my &s;oul,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. It puts him upon loud cries, and earne&s;t expo&s;tulations with God; and the&s;e al&s;o with a mixture of faith and unbelief: He pleads with God, argueth the ca&s;e with him, begs hard of him; &s;o he, P&s;al. 42.9. <HI>I will &s;ay unto God my rock, why ha&s;t thou forgotten me?</HI> he draws de&s;ponding conclu&s;ions, and eats them up again, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 32.22. <HI>I &s;aid in my ha&s;te, I am cut off; neverthele&s;s thou ha&s;t heard the voice of my &s;upplications</HI>&punc; Jonah 2.4. <HI>I &s;aid I am ca&s;t out of thy &s;ight, yet I will look a|gain toward thy holy Temple.</HI> He cries out, <HI>how long?</HI> P&s;al. 13.1. he deliberates with him&s;elf, and expo&s;tulates with God, P&s;al. 85.5, 6. <HI>wilt thou be angry for ever? wilt thou not revive me</HI>?</P>

and infrequent; the effects are u&s;ually an&s;werable; and though faith be not utterly extinct, yet its actings are next to indi&s;cernable, but unbelief gets head, and break<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> forth into am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zing effects; the principal whereof are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. It makes him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all the work that was wrought in him. He not only que&s;tions it, but pa&s;&s;eth a de|finitive &s;entence upon it. He concludes that he hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">laid the hypocrite all this while; di&s;&s;embled with God, and impo&s;ed upon men, and deceived his own &s;oul&punc; <HI>David</HI> had &s;ome &s;uch re|&s;entments on him, when he prayed God to <HI>Create a clean heart in him, P&s;al.</HI> 51.10. nay, tho&s;e very things which &s;ometimes were his evidence for his good e&s;tate, and in which he could take comfort, are now turned into ar|guments to di&s;prove it.</P>
<P N="2">2. It creates prejudices again&s;t God. He hath, in this condition, to do with the fierce Wrath of God; he appre|hends that God hates him, and is his enemy, Job 33.24. <HI>Wherefore hide&s;t thou thy face, and bolde&s;t me for thine enemy</HI>; and ver&s;e 26. <HI>thou write&s;t bitter things a|gain&s;t me.</HI> The very thoughts of God,

which were wont to be his relief and &s;olace are now his di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 77.3. <HI>I remembred God and was troubled</HI>; and he begins to call all the encouragements, promi&s;es, hopes that ever he had from him in que&s;tion, and &s;u&s;pects the truth of them all, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 7, 8, 9. <HI>will the Lord ca&s;t off for ever? &amp;c.</HI> and is ready to conclude that he hath &s;erved an hard ma&s;ter; to &s;ay, as P&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> 13. <HI>I have clean&s;ed mine heart in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> have wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed mine hands in innocency.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This hurries him to conclude him|&s;elf a Ca&s;t-away. It brings him to the very brink of de&s;pair, and he is ready to vote him&s;elf not only an unregenerate per&s;on, but a reprobate; that as he never was a Child of God, &s;o he never &s;hall he&punc; he is ju&s;t throwing him&s;elf upon this de&s;perate conclu&s;ion, Lam. 3.18 <HI>I &s;aid, my &s;trength and mine hope is p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;hed from the Lord:</HI> And this puts him into a deadly di&s;couragement, and produceth &s;uch things as the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. It di&s;courageth him from all u&s;e of means: Tho&s;e very Duties and Ordi|nances, which were heretofore his de|light, are now his terrour, and he is a|fraid of them. What &s;hould he pray

for? God will not hear him: Why &s;hould he read the word? he reads no|thing there but his own doom, and eve|ry thing in it &s;peaks evil again&s;t him: Why &s;hould he go to the Hou&s;e of God, to attend upon the Ordinances there di&s;pen&s;ed? he &s;hall but encrea&s;e his guilt, and lay in the more again&s;t him&s;elf, when every Prayer and Sermon will ri&s;e up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> judgment to condemn him: he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not approach to the Lords Table, le&s;t he &s;hould there a new <HI>Seal</HI> up his own <HI>Damnation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. This makes him afraid either to live or to dy. His trouble is &s;o inten&s;e, that &s;ometimes his <HI>Soul chu&s;eth &s;trangling and death rather than his life, as he, Job</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="000901_0068_0FAC9A97626F00A0">

<P N="1">1. That man is naturally in&s;atiably de&s;irous of happine&s;s, and aver&s;e to mi&s;ery.

<P N="2">2. That man is a dependent Creature, and mu&s;t have an object of tru&s;t, for happine&s;s, and freedom from evil and mi&s;ery. He hath not his felicity, nor his &s;ecurity in him&s;elf, but mu&s;t have it from abroad; and if he have it, he mu&s;t have an object that is able to de|rive it to him, on whom he may rely; el&s;e his tru&s;t will be vain, and his ex|pectation fru&s;trate: hence their com|plaint on this account, <HI>Lam.</HI> 4.17. <HI>As for us, our eyes yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not &s;ave us.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. If there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore his object fail him, and he have no other to rely upon, he mu&s;t needs be perplexed.

It is cer|tain that according as men apprehend the good or evil they are concerned in, they will be proportionably affected with it; for the affections are moved by the will, according to the re&s;entment which it hath of the good or evil which are the objects of it The&s;e things are accommodated to the rational powers which God hath put into man, and are an&s;werably exerted by the Children of God, in whom grace doth not de&s;troy but rectify nature. Here therefore let us take a particular account of them, as they refer to the matter before us, in the following Conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Child of God hath been made apprehen&s;ive of the fearful mi&s;ery under which he was by &s;in. This is wrought in the Heart and Con&s;cience&punc; by the Spirit of God, in order to the making of the Children of men the Children of God; and the remembrance of it abides with them as long as they live. Fallen man is in a mi&s;erable condition, hav|ing lo&s;t his right to all good, and being fallen under a cur&s;e that involves all

infelicities in it. The natural man doth not re&s;ent this of him&s;elf; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God, when he comes to conveit a &s;inner, re|veals it to him, and makes him to know it and feel it, and that both temporal and &s;piritual: hence that, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.19. <HI>Know and &s;ee that it is an evil thing and bitter:</HI> and this belongs to the work of the Spirit, <HI>Joh.</HI> 16.8. <HI>He &s;hall convince the world of &s;in.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He hath been deeply concerned to e&s;cape this mi&s;ery, and obtain eter|nal felicity. This al&s;o hath been the fruit of the operation of the Spirit in him: for, though nature it &s;elf &s;timu|lates men to enquire after an e&s;cape, up|on conviction of danger, and to u&s;e means to obtain it, yet it is God only who hath di&s;covered the way for it, and moves the &s;oul to hearken after it; for, by the light of nature there was no di&s;covery of this: nor can the natural man <HI>comprehend it,</HI> when it is di&s;covered in the Go&s;pel: but God hath touched the heart of this man with a remor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and an enquiry, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be Sa|ved?</HI> and made him very &s;ollicitous to obtain it: he was loth to peri&s;h, and longed that he might e&s;cape; and the
<PB N="73" REF="000901_0072_0FAC9A9A62A22278">
terrours which he read in the threatning were &s;o great upon him, and &s;uch was his expectation of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alling upon him, that he re&s;tle&s;ly longed for relief.</P>
<P N="3">3 He hath found the emptine&s;s and in&s;ufficiency of every other object of tru&s;t: He hath been looking every way for relief; he hath been trying many cour&s;es to help him&s;elf, but they have all di&s;appointed him; he hath gone to the <HI>world,</HI> and that hath deceived him; he hath looked to his <HI>pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ledges,</HI> and they have not &s;uccoured him; he hath attempted his own <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and that hath failed him: he hath accordingly been broken off from all the&s;e, and dares no longer to look that way; hath re&s;olved as they&punc; <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 14.3 <HI>A&s;hur &s;hall not &s;ave us,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.23. <HI>in vain is &s;alvation hoped for from the hills, and the multitude of mountains.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. He hath di&s;covered the fulne&s;s of &s;ufficiency there is in God, thro' Chri&s;t, to deliver him, and make him perfectly ble&s;&s;ed. God hath made him&s;elf known to him in his communicable perfections, to be one in whom he may tru&s;t for &s;alvation; and hath revealed him&s;elf in the face of Chri&s;t, as a God ready to
<PB N="74" REF="000901_0073_0FAC9A9B23854EB8">
receive him, and be&s;tow eternal &s;alvati|on upon him: he hath &s;een that he can deliver him from all his mi&s;eries, and fill him with tho&s;e glories which &s;hall make him &s;atisfied: he hath appeared to him, as a <HI>&s;un and a &s;hield,</HI> and the author of <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>glory</HI> and <HI>every good thing,</HI> P&s;al. 84.11.

<P N="5">5. He hath utterly renounced all other tru&s;t, and placed his alone hope in God, through Chri&s;t for &s;alvation. He hath rejected the world, both men and things of it, and ca&s;t off all his own righteou&s;|ne&s;s and &s;trength, and cho&s;en God in Chri&s;t for his portion, and &s;aid to him, as P&s;al. 73.21. <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is nothing on the earth that I de&s;ire in compari&s;on of thee</HI>; and hath obliged his &s;oul to this, as P&s;al. 62.5, 6. <HI>my &s;oul tru&s;t thou in God alone,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="6">6. Hence his life is bound up in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avour of God: All his help is in that; he hath no where el&s;e to go; he is re|&s;olved in this, that if God do not &s;ave him, he mu&s;t peri&s;h; if he be not his portion, he mu&s;t have none: if God

<P N="7">7. Hence the anger of God cannot but be very terrible to him, if he hath his whole dependence for time and eter|nity on Gods favour; &s;urely then it can|not but be very bitter, to &s;ee him di&s;co|ver his anger, and look to him as an E|nemy: this is it that he alone account<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fearful; P&s;al. 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.7. <HI>Thou, even thou ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be feared, and who is he that can &s;tand, when once thou art angry?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Tho&s;e withdrawings of his di&s;cover him as an angry God, to his Children.

<P N="1">1. Learn hence what a fooli&s;h thing it is for the Children of God, to nouri&s;h in them&s;elves carnal confidence, &amp; &s;ecurity. We ought indeed to live in the exerci&s;e of <HI>Faith,</HI> and labour always to &s;trengthen and e&s;tabli&s;h it; but there is a <HI>Pre&s;ump|tion</HI>
which the be&s;t are in hazard of, and if they reckon it to be a &s;trong faith, they grievou&s;ly mi&s;take them&s;elves. For a believer, when he finds his heart en|gaged, to think him&s;elf Temptation proof, and be thereupon adventurous beyond a Call; or becau&s;e he now &s;tands in <HI>the light of Gods countenance,</HI> to conclude that he &s;hall never be beclouded again, is carnal confidence: and the Doctrine be|fore us will di&s;cover the folly of it, if we con&s;ider;</P>

<P N="2">2. There is no rea&s;on for us to pro|mi&s;e our &s;elves that we &s;hall never be De&s;erted, but on the other hand, great rea&s;on to expect it. Faith ought to be able to give a rea&s;on for its confidence, but there is none to be rendred for this, for&punc;</P>
<P N="1">1. The be&s;t of Gods people have been De&s;erted: So that Grace is no &s;ecurity again&s;t it.

<P N="2">2. God hath made no promi&s;es to us that we &s;hall not be De&s;erted. He hath indeed promi&s;ed that <HI>He will never for|&s;ake his people,</HI> but hath not &s;aid that he will never withdraw, or hide his face from them. Nay, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> far is it from this, that he hath threatned it in ca&s;e, and made it one of the cha&s;tizements which he inflicts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them for their follies. Now faith mu&s;t have a word on which it builds its conclu&s;ion, el&s;e it is not faith, but pre&s;umption; and a Divine faith mu&s;t rely on the Te&s;timony of God, beyond which it dares not to go.</P>
<P N="3">3. As long as we live here, we are in hazard of provoking God to de&s;ert us. We ob&s;erved in the Doctrinal part, that the more bold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, or more gro&s;s &s;inful neglects of the people of God are the procurers of this, and that by it he corrects them for &s;uch follies: and we are not &s;ecure again&s;t the&s;e. We have a deceitful heart in us, a carnal part that will betray us, if it can: a vigilant <HI>Ad|ver&s;ary</HI>

that lieth in wait to hurt us, and we walk in the mid&s;t of &s;nares, and traps, and pits that are covered, and if we be not the more watchful, we &s;hall be en&s;nared in them.</P>
<P N="4">4 Nay, God may, if he &s;ees meet, &s;o exerci&s;e us, when we are mo&s;t heed|ful to our &s;elves: for we ob&s;erved, that God may do it for the farther exerci&s;e and advancement of the Grace of his Children; and accordingly di&s;|pen&s;eth him&s;elf, in this regard, with a great deal of arbitrary liberty; &s;o that though we take heed to our &s;elves, and diligently attend to Gods coun&s;els, that we may be brought into the dark; for this is pre&s;umed of &s;uch as <HI>fear the Lord, and obey the voice of his Servants, I&s;a.</HI> 50.10. not but that the mo&s;t like|ly way to enjoy the mo&s;t of God with us, is to walk clo&s;e with him, in obe|dience to his revealed will: however, he is Soveraign, and his wi&s;dom knows what is be&s;t; we therefore ought not to be &s;ecure.</P>
<P N="3">3. It will greatly encrea&s;e the perplex|ity of a de&s;ertion, when it comes unex|pected. We are wont to &s;ay, <HI>forewarn|ed, &s;ore armed.</HI> De&s;ertions are hard to

But out of doubt <HI>Davids</HI> trouble was the greater, becau&s;e he was &s;ecure again&s;t it&punc; never looked for the wind to blow any&punc; more from that quarter. Sudden &s;urpri|zes are a&s;toni&s;hing, and di&s;compo&s;e us much; whereas expected evils are fore pondered, and accordingly we are laid in the better to meet with them; and they are not &s;trange.</P>
<P N="4">4. And indeed there is nothing will &s;ooner procure this de&s;ertion, than &s;uch carnal confidence, and good rea&s;on, for there is nothing which puts a Child of God more out of frame for the due &s;er|ving of God, and exerci&s;ing of faith on him, or more expo&s;eth him to be a prey to the adver&s;ary, and entangled in every temptation.

<P N="2">2. This tells us&punc; that it is a dangerous thing for a Chri&s;tian, to value him&s;elf only upon the comforts which he enjoys in Gods pre&s;ence. It is the duty of Gods people, to get and keep a clear evidence of their good e&s;tate, according to, 2 Pet. 1.10. <HI>give all diligence to make your call|ing and election &s;ure</HI>; and to be very &s;ol|licitous on this account, is a good &s;ign that we value the favour of God more than life: but it is great wi&s;dom to get this &s;o &s;ettled, as we may be able to make u&s;e of it at all times: and hence to have nothing to conclude it from but the&s;e comforts, is not &s;afe. Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is true, it is a &s;erene time with us, when we are &s;o, and we cannot but be &s;trengthened by the experience of it. A Child of God mu&s;t needs be abun|dant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;atisfied, when he finds him&s;elf in the arms and embraces of his Saviour, when <HI>Chri&s;t brings him into his Chambers, and &s;preads his banner of love over him</HI>; when he hath all the witne&s;s, &s;eals, and earne&s;ts of the &s;pirit afforded him:

<P N="2">2. What &s;hall we do when the&s;e are lo&s;t? we have been a&s;&s;ured that they may &s;o be; and to what a mea&s;ure th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> privation may arrive, God only know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; and it is our duty to be laying in for a wet day. A Chri&s;tian ought to be pro|vided to be able to hold out in a &s;torm, as well as to flouri&s;h in a calm: though he wants the comfort, yet he &s;hould keep his re&s;olution, and &s;ay as he, <HI>Job</HI> 13 15. <HI>although he &s;lay me, I will tru&s;t in him,</HI> how this is to be done, will come to be pointed at in a following U&s;e: here on|ly in general let me offer thus much&punc; <HI>viz.</HI> let us not only boa&s;t, though there is great rea&s;on to boa&s;t, in the comforts of Gods pre&s;ence with us, but let us la|bour to be acquainted wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h our grounds

of <HI>A&s;surance</HI>; that it is undoubtedly the <HI>light of his countenance</HI> that we do at pre|&s;ent enjoy, and that there is no mi&s;take in it.

this is, and are ready to be &s;tumbled &amp; prejudiced at it: but it is not to be thought a &s;trange thing. Ob&s;erve then,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Chri&s;tians life depends on the influence of the love of <HI>God Paul</HI> &s;aith, Gal 2 20. <HI>I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me.</HI> There is a double life of a Child of God; a life of <HI>holine&s;s,</HI> and a li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of <HI>comfort</HI>; the one belongs to his <HI>Sanctification,</HI> the other is a part of his <HI>Inchoate Glory</HI>: now the maintain|ance and &s;upport of both the&s;e flows from the Communications of Gods love to him: Not only doth God in love be|&s;tow the principles of holine&s;s upon him as Jer. 31.3. <HI>I have loved thee with an everla&s;ting love, therefore in loving kindne&s;s have I drawn thee:</HI> But the upholding &amp; acting of it, is by the &s;ame author, <HI>John</HI> 15.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>without me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> do nothing.</HI> Phil. 4.13. <HI>I can do all things, through Chri&s;t &s;trengthning me</HI>; he al&s;o is the <HI>God of all Con&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation,</HI> as he is called, <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.5.</P>
<P N="2">2. God doth not always appear to them alike in the di&s;pen&s;ation of his love to them. He indeed loves them always unchangeably; but in the application of this to them, he acts his plea&s;ure, accor|ding to his Wi&s;dom. Sometime he af|fords
<PB N="88" REF="000901_0087_0FAC9AA5CDAD57C0">
them a mighty pre&s;ence, in aiding of their graces, and then <HI>their &s;ouls &s;et them as the Chariots of Amminadib</HI>; but anon he witholds this, and leaves them to them&s;elves, and then all flags in an in|&s;tant, now their <HI>hands hang down and their knees buckle under them,</HI> and their graces are in a withering condition. Some|times he refre&s;heth them with his <HI>flaggons</HI> and then their hearts are cheered as with <HI>new wine,</HI> anon he witholds the&s;e ra|vi&s;hing, and carries it aloof, and they are <HI>ca&s;t down and di&s;quieted.</HI> Thus he will let them know, that their all depends up|on him.</P>
<P N="3">3. And the&s;e changes many times have their frequent revolutions. It is not only thus for once and away, but the <HI>Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> now &s;hines bright upon them, anon it is beclouded, and then it breaks out again, but pre&s;ently a &s;able cloud interpo&s;eth. No wonder then if there are &s;uch alterations in their carriage, when there is &s;uch a change in Gods di&s;covering of him&s;elf to them. The coming &amp; going of the Sun makes Summer &amp; Winter. And indeed, though it be always our duty to be in the exer|ci&s;e of our faith, yet it becomes us to

&s;at under his &s;hadow with great delight, &amp; his fruit was &s;weet to my ta&s;t: he brought me to the banqueting hou&s;e, and his barner over me was love.</HI> To &s;uch let me give this coun&s;el.</P>
<P N="1">1. Take heed of being proud of the&s;e vi&s;its. Truly there is rea&s;on to be ex|ceedingly glad of them; <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> doth therein wonderfully manife&s;t his love to the Soul: but you have no rea&s;on to be <HI>High minded</HI> on this account: it is a free favour, and you ought to &s;ay, what am I that he &s;hould thus regard me a &s;inful worm? remember that the&s;e vi&s;its are not your ordinary repa&s;t; you mu&s;t have &s;omething el&s;e to live upon. It may be you never had &s;uch a treat from him be|fore, &amp; po&s;&s;ibly you &s;hall never meet with &s;uch another, till you come to be lodged in his everla&s;ting embraces: and if you begin to be lifted up, there is a <HI>Thorn</HI> ready to prick this bladder, as <HI>Paul</HI> had his for his prevention, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.7.</P>
<P N="2">2. Expect that there is &s;ome extraor|dinary either Service or Tryal near to you. Gods <HI>Extraordinary Vi&s;its</HI> are u&s;u|ally to prepare us for <HI>Extraordinary Ex|erci&s;es.</HI> The time when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> took his Di&s;ciples with him into the mount wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a little before he was to be taken from
<PB N="110" REF="000901_0109_0FAC9AB6225B8458">
them, and they had hard Service to engage in. When <HI>Paul</HI> was to be pecu|liarly u&s;ed in <HI>Christs</HI> work, and expo&s;ed to greater tryals than any of the other <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> he had glorious vi&s;ions of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> It is good for the Children of God to <HI>Rejoyce with Fear.</HI> Expect now to be called into the field, and to have your graces proved with great Temptations. Lay in then for it, and be &s;ure to take down by faith, large draughts of the&s;e flaggons of con&s;olation, which may be for &s;uitable &s;upport under &s;uch tryals: and helping you with re&s;olution to go through them: this will be your be&s;t wi&s;dom, and &s;o &s;hall you be prepared for &s;uch an hour.</P>
<P N="4">4. To &s;uch as are conducted in a middle way. Po&s;&s;ibly you have had no experience of the extraordinary raptures, and tran&s;porting joys that &s;ome can tell of; and on the other hand, you have not encountred tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing plunges, and di&s;mal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arkne&s;&s;es, ari&s;ing from grie|vous <HI>De&s;ertions,</HI> which others al&s;o have cryed out bitterly of; but your way is more even; you are not without your fears, but yet you can <HI>hope in Gods Grace,</HI> and encourage your Souls to tru&s;t in

him, and <HI>wait for his Salvation.</HI> And if &s;ometimes there be a cloud that doth a little ob&s;cure you, it is not long be|fore a ray breaks forth and giveth you light: and though you &s;en&s;ibly labour of infirmities, yet you are kept from <HI>great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and helped in the work of God which you are engaged in: and this is likely the condition of the greate&s;t part of Gods Children. To &s;uch then let me offer,</P>
<P N="1">1. Believe that God is infinitely wi&s;e in his conduct. Be &s;ure that you main|tain adoring thoughts of him: judge therefore that this is the be&s;t condition for you. Reckon that your father knows what is mo&s;t proper for every one of his Children, and that his love ma|nageth all the&s;e concerns. Think, this is the way in which he &s;ees meet to lead me, and I believe it is the <HI>right way</HI>; and how little cau&s;e you have to mur|mure that it is otherwi&s;e with &s;ome. Do not &s;ay that God deals better with them than with you: what though you do not meet with their raptures? con&s;ider al&s;o that you are not oppre&s;t with their de&s;olate tryals.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be much in &s;tabli&s;hing your hope.
<PB N="112" REF="000901_0111_0FAC9AB7A27BAEB8">
God hath given you a good hope; make much of it, and be always fortifying of it, and take heed of expo&s;ing it to be undermined: and in &s;pecial, beware of that temptation which is &s;ometimes urged to di&s;quiet and di&s;turb the minds of the Children of God, <HI>viz.</HI> to que&s;tion the &s;olidity of your hope, becau&s;e you have not been entertained with tho&s;e hor|rours that others have not met withal, nor tho&s;e ravi&s;hings which &s;ome talk of.

Let your care be to &s;ee that the <HI>root of the matter</HI> is in you, and that your hope is built upon the Grace of God in Chri&s;t, revealed in you, and is &s;uch an hope as &s;ets you upon the pur&s;uit of Holine&s;s, according to, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.3. <HI>He that hath this hope in him, purifieth him&s;elf, as he is pure.</HI> And let this encourage you to be very faith|ful in Serving of God, and waiting <HI>to &s;ee his Salvation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And let your fear produce the greater caution in you: let not your fear di&s;turb and weaken your hope, but &s;erve it. Let it quicken your &s;piritual watch, let it maintain in you an holy awe and reverence of God, and help

<P N="1">1. To &s;uch as &s;ometimes thought them&s;elves converted, but were mi&s;taken in their apprehen&s;ion: and now they

They have po&s;&s;ibly formerly pretended to great confidence, but now they are in fear. Give me leave to lay out the ca&s;e of the&s;e, and then offer them &s;ome coun&s;el: for the di&s;covery of &s;uch, let the&s;e things be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. There are tho&s;e that have had &s;omething of a common work on them, every one hath a <HI>natural Con&s;cience</HI> in him, who&s;e nature and office is to re|flect inward, and apply practical truths to one &s;elf, and this Con&s;cience is not at once brawned and &s;eared: the Word &amp; Ordinances are accommodated to meet with mens Con&s;ciences, to put them in fear, and make them &s;ollicitous: and the Spirit of God often comes in the&s;e means under which men &s;it, and &s;trives, and gives them inward touches and a|wakenings, which puts them upon en|deavours to get quiet; and though natu|ral corruption &s;eeks to &s;tifle &s;uch moti|ons, and divert them from them, and &s;o <HI>quench the Spirit</HI>: yet they cannot always &s;o do, but are put upon it to do &s;ome|thing
<PB N="115" REF="000901_0114_0FAC9AB9E44EA5B0">
that may bring them inward peace, and nouri&s;h in them an hope that it &s;hall go well with them; that they are reconciled unto God, and &s;hall e&s;cape his terrible indignation; &s;o it was with them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 33.24.</P>
<P N="2">2. But they have taken up &s;hort of a good foundation: The work hath not been carried through, but hath &s;topped in the way, and they have re&s;ted in &s;omething el&s;e, before they have come over to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which hath prevented their coming: and this is a frequent de|ceit. The conviction of &s;ome leads them to a <HI>Legal Reformation</HI>: they have &s;een &s;ome of their actual &s;ins, and the Law that hath been broken by them, and the threatning out again&s;t &s;uch &s;ins written in it, but have not been led to the fountain of original &s;in from which the&s;e &s;treams do flow; and &s;o they were never concerned for a <HI>new heart,</HI> but thought if they took up a new life, ab&s;tained from tho&s;e &s;ins in practice, &amp; &s;et upon the practice of neglected du|ties, they &s;hould herein plea&s;e God, and hereupon they have pacified their Con|&s;ciences; this was the farthe&s;t reach of the <HI>Phari&s;e,</HI> Luk. 18.11. or po&s;&s;ibly their
<PB N="116" REF="000901_0115_0FAC9ABAA2328440">
trouble for &s;in hath been met with the general offer of pardon, upon believing in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and they have entertained it with <HI>joy,</HI> as the <HI>&s;tony ground</HI> hearers are repre&s;ented, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.20. they accept of the offer, and now they are &s;ecure: but they never knew the utter impotency to believe which they labour of: never un|der&s;tood the truth of that, Joh. 6.44 <HI>No man can come unto me, except the father that hath &s;ent me draw him</HI>; and &s;o they re&s;t in a faith of their own, and have not that which is <HI>of the operation of the &s;pirit,</HI> being never humbled out of their own <HI>Suffici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncy</HI> and <HI>Soveraignty.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Upon this they have thought that much a&s;&s;i&s;tance and comfort have been afforded them; they have engaged in moral and religious duties, and been car|ried to and through them with a great deal of plea&s;ure and ea&s;e, and it hath greatly &s;atisfied them; and they have reckoned the&s;e for influences of grace, and <HI>joys of the &s;pirit</HI>; by rea&s;on whereof they have argued them&s;elves, to a &s;trong per&s;wa&s;ion and high confidence that all was well with them, and have &s;aid to them&s;elves, as <HI>Agag</HI> once did, <HI>the bitter|ne&s;s of death it over.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="117" REF="000901_0116_0FAC9ABB6448D568">4. But now they find all this to fail them, and they are brought into a deep plunge. Now they are made to &s;ee that they can do nothing: they are either left to &s;ome foul &s;in, or con&s;cience is awakned to tell them, they have deceived them&s;elves, and that they are in the <HI>gall of bitterne&s;s</HI>; that the Wrath of God is upon them, their whole profe&s;&s;ion is a meer cheat, &amp; their <HI>building is upon the &s;and</HI>; and this puts them into fears, and po&s;&s;ibly they take it for a <HI>de&s;ertion</HI>; whereas indeed it is but a <HI>di&s;covery.</HI> In &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, let me offer two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. This calls you to &s;earch your &s;elves to the bottom: the ca&s;e of &s;uch hath &s;ome re&s;emblance to that of de&s;erted Saints: when therefore it is &s;o, the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s is a trial of our &s;elves throughly; and herein we mu&s;t <HI>prove our &s;elves,</HI> whether ever we were <HI>in the faith,</HI> as they are advi&s;ed, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13 5. whether ever we were throughly broken off from every other object, and brought over to Chri&s;t, and built upon him: yea, and to beg of God al&s;o to &s;earch us, that we be not mi&s;taken in the very founda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|on; for an errour there cannot be re|paired in any other way, but in laying it
<PB N="118" REF="000901_0117_0FAC9ABC23FD2A50">
a new, and digging deep enough for it.</P>
<P N="2">2. If you have failed here, this is a merciful di&s;pen&s;ation to you: Had God left you under the&s;e mi&s;takes, you would have gone on &s;ecurely, and dropt una|wares into perdi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion. God hath not de|&s;erted you, but made your fal&s;e hopes to for&s;ake you, that &s;o you might in time &s;eek a better &s;ecurity. This is the way in which God is wont to bring <HI>proud legali&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>carnal Go&s;pellers</HI> home to him&s;elf. God is not going from you, but coming to you, and the&s;e are the methods of the Holy Spirit: this is the be&s;t &s;ign that God hath a purpo&s;e of e|verla&s;ting love to you, and is now co|ming to draw you home to him&s;elf: for he will drive that &s;oul out of &s;elf, and its own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which he will have mercy upon and &s;ave. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Our main bu&s;ine&s;s is with tho&s;e that have indeed the root of the matter in them; have a principle of &s;aving Grace, and belong to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but are un|der <HI>De&s;ertion.</HI> And there are two things which I &s;hall apply my &s;elf unto in re|&s;pect to the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. To direct them how to carry it un|der the&s;e <HI>De&s;ertions.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="119" REF="000901_0118_0FAC9ABCE6CE20B8">2. To point what is to be done to get relief under, &amp; deliverance from them.</P>
<P N="1">1. For direction how to carry it under the&s;e <HI>De&s;ertions.</HI> There is a right beha|viour which God expects of his Chil|dren, when he thus treats them: and it is for his honour, and our advantage, that we comply with it. And there are three things that I &s;hall urge on this ac|count.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be &s;ure to carry it humbly towards God. God expects it, and is now put|ting of this grace to the trial; let it then have its exerci&s;e, and &s;eek to him for help herein, and for your guidance in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Adore his Soveraignty: it may be your dejected and di&s;quiet minds, are entertaining &s;trange &s;urmizes about the Providence of God in this, &amp; <HI>leavened,</HI> as his was, in <HI>P&s;a.</HI> 73. and 77. but know it; if you cannot re&s;olve your &s;elves in the particular rea&s;on of it, this is enough to &s;ilence and &s;atisfy you, that it is of God, who can do no wrong, and is not to be <HI>contended</HI> with. <HI>Job</HI> was brought to this, before God had done with him: he was ready to &s;ay, <HI>behold, I am vile, Chap.</HI> 40.5. and to re&s;olve to <HI>lay his hand upon his mouth.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="120" REF="000901_0119_0FAC9ABDA23AF468">2. Acknowledge his Righteou&s;ne&s;s&punc; Po&s;&s;ibly you may, upon enquiry, &s;ee a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for his &s;o de&s;erting of you; yea, the particular provocation that hath procured it&punc; here is enough to bring you to his fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and put you upon humble confe&s;&s;ing his ju&s;tice and equity in his proceedings: this <HI>David</HI> aims at in our <HI>Context, ver&s;e</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. by telling us how his was introduced. But if you are at a lo&s;s about the particular occa&s;ion, yet you have always enough before you, if you are humble, to make you to &s;ay, God had rea&s;on enough to deal thus with me, and it is rich mercy, that he doth not always do &s;o.</P>
<P N="3">3. Beware of charging him with par|tiality. There is an envy on this ac|count, too apt to di&s;cover it &s;elf; &s;uch as was in <HI>Peter,</HI> when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had told him what trials he mu&s;t encounter, is inqui&s;i|tive what mu&s;t befal the <HI>beloved Di&s;ciple,</HI> for which he received a rebuke, <HI>Joh.</HI> 21.21, 22. hence &s;uch mu&s;ing&punc; are enter|tained: Why are the&s;e taken into fami|liarity with him, and I mu&s;t be treated at a di&s;tance? Why do they enjoy his &s;miles, and I &s;uffer his frowns? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> take heed of pining; <HI>Why &s;hould your eye be
<PB N="121" REF="000901_0120_0FAC9ABE83A2D8E0">
evil, becau&s;e his is good?</HI> mu&s;t his love be cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in que&s;tion by your jealou&s;ie? or mu&s;t he ask your coun&s;el and leave how to carry it in his family?</P>
<P N="4">4. Call neither his truth nor his wi&s;dom in que&s;tion on this account. Say not, how can he bring good to me out of this, or what advantage can accrue to me by it? Say not, where is now the vera|ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of his word which he hath made me to hope in? how is this the performance of his promi&s;e? this is pride: Remem|ber, <HI>His thoughts are not as your thoughts, nor his ways as your ways, but as high above them as the heaven is above the earth.</HI> Re&s;olve that he is the <HI>Potter,</HI> and you the <HI>Clay,</HI> and that you will lye as &s;uch in his hand.</P>
<P N="2">2. Have a care of ra&s;hly judging your own &s;tate from hence. How ready are the Children of God in a dark hour, to ca&s;t off their hope, &amp; repeal their eviden|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and vote them&s;elves <HI>Hypocrites?</HI> this ought not to be, nor doth it &s;erve to the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty lying upon you at &s;uch a time, but is c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y to it. God expects that now you &s;hould not let go your hold of faith on him, but that you take the fa&s;ter hold, and &s;ay as he, <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b</HI> 13.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">5. <HI>Though

<P N="1">1. It is no new thing for Gods Chil|dren to be De&s;erted. It ought not then to be a &s;trange thing to you, much le&s;s an argument that becau&s;e of this, you are none of his Children. This &s;topt the <HI>P&s;almists</HI> mouth, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 73.15. <HI>If I &s;ay, I will &s;peak thus, I &s;hould offend against the generation of thy Children.</HI> As to the more remi&s;s <HI>De&s;ertions,</HI> it may be &s;aid to you, as, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.13. <HI>There hath no temptation taken you, but &s;uch as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> common to man.</HI> And if you combate with &s;uch as are more inten&s;e, and full of darkne&s;s, yet you are not without the in&s;tances of &s;uch, who were very dear to God. There can then be no &s;uch conclu&s;ion &s;afely built on this argument: it cannot amount to a Demon&s;tration, &s;ince this is one part of the way in which God leads his own to glory.</P>
<P N="2">2. There may be Grace where there wants light: it is true, a Child of God cannot &s;ee or read it, when the light is taken from him: but po&s;&s;ibly he hath read it, when he enjoyed this light: and the withdrawing of it from him doth
<PB N="123" REF="000901_0122_0FAC9ABFE226EB80">
not make any alteration in his &s;tate, though it doth in his &s;en&s;e of it. This therefore ought not to beat you off from your former experiences, but calls you rather more carefully to improve them, as he, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 77.10, 11. <HI>I will remember the years of the right hard of the mo&s;t high, I will remember the works of the Lord, &amp;c.</HI> If Grace were gone, every time comfort and a&s;&s;urance is ob&s;cured, it would be &s;ad indeed; but it is nothing &s;o; your &s;tate is the &s;ame, though your frame be altered.</P>
<P N="3">3. There may be the evidence of true Grace, where there is not the evidence of &s;trong Grace: and rea&s;on good, for there may be faith, though not like <HI>Abraham,</HI> who <HI>against hope, believed in hope,</HI> but like a grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed. There are the Characters of real faith, in its lowe&s;t actings; and there are the notes of the &s;trong &amp; vigorous actings of it: and we are apt to apply our &s;elves in an hour of temptation, to the latter, and becau&s;e we find them not, we over|look the former, and vote our &s;elves to have none, becau&s;e we have it not in &s;uch degrees, and hereby we greatly in|jure our &s;elves.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="124" REF="000901_0123_0FAC9AC107117E78">4. God may not be withdrawn as to A&s;&s;i&s;tance, when he is &s;o as to comfort: and certainly this affords matter of en|couragement in a dark time. Nay, it is to be ob&s;erved, that &s;ometimes God gives more powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tances at &s;uch a time.

<P N="3">3 Above all take heed of concluding your &s;elves Reprobates.

<P N="2">2. He is able to deliver you.
