<HEAD>In Council,

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I INCLOSE you by expre&s;s, three acts of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of A&s;&s;embly for a&s;certaining the number of militia in the &s;tate; exempting artificers employed at iron works from militia duty, and remedying the inconveniencies ari&s;ing from the inter|ruption of the draught and he procuring clothes, provi&s;ions, and waggons for the army.</P>
<P>WE expect to &s;end a ve&s;&s;el &s;hortly with a flag, from this place to Charle&s;town, with tobacco, to be di&s;po&s;ed of for our captive officers and &s;oldiers there. Be &s;o good as to give notice to the friends of any of them within your county, that any articles which they may think proper to &s;end for their relief by that conveyance, &s;hall have a free pa&s;&s;age, if ready to be delivered here by the la&s;t of April, and not too much for the &s;pare room in the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>THE number of de&s;erters from the Briti&s;h army who have taken refuge in this &s;tate, is now con&s;iderable, and daily augmenting. The&s;e people notwith&s;tanding their coming over to us, being deemed in law alien enemies, and as &s;uch, not admi&s;&s;ible to be citizens, are not within the &s;cope of the militia and inva&s;ion laws, under which citizens alone can be embodied I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve this to you, le&s;t any errour in this point &s;hould creep into practice, by incorporating tho&s;e per&s;ons into the militia of the &s;tate.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honour to be, with great re&s;pect, Sir,
Your mo&s;t obedient, and mo&s;t humble &s;ervant,</SIGNED></CLOSER>
