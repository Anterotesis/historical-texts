As then a fountain is a repo&s;itory which God hath, in the work of Creation, provided for the trea&s;uring up of waters in, &s;o is Chri&s;t a Store-hou&s;e of all Grace, in whom it is laid up.

&s;mall Springs, that are but little veins in the earth, do vent but a little water, becau&s;e they have not much in them; but a fountain hath abundance in it, it is a va&s;t trea&s;ury; there is no want in a fountain, but there may come as many as will to it, and have a full &s;upply of water from it; and &s;uch a fountain of Grace is Je&s;us Chri&s;t to his people; for this rea&s;on is he &s;aid to <HI>be full of Grace and Truth, Joh.</HI> 1.14.

<P><HI>A.</HI> We ob&s;erved, that a fountain is properly a receptacle of waters, and therefore is Meto|nymically put for the waters them&s;elves that are in it; and we may here keep to the allu|&s;ion. Water is one of tho&s;e things that are nece&s;&s;ary for the life of man, and afford a ma|nifold benefit unto it; it quencheth the thir&s;t, it revives the &s;pirits, it comforts the man, it cools and refre&s;heth the body, it is of u&s;e al&s;o for clean&s;ing or purifying both the body, and &s;uch things as are for its u&s;e and comfort: and indeed &s;uch is the u&s;efulne&s;s of this Element, that the want of it makes the man mi&s;erable, and if he be not &s;upplied with it, he will un|avoidably peri&s;h.

<P N="3">3. <HI>How he came to be &s;uch a fountain?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This flows from his Mediator-&s;hip, and may be traced in the&s;e four particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Mans Apo&s;ta&s;y had cut him off from God as the fountain of life to him.</HI> All mans happine&s;s is fountained in God, and mu&s;t derive from him by way of participation. He was at fir&s;t, in his &s;tate of Integrity, planted by this fountain, had free acce&s;s to it, and could refre&s;h him&s;elf at all times with it; the &s;treams of it ran down freely on him: but when he &s;inned a|gain&s;t God, that made a woful &s;eparation, &s;o God tells them, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 59.2. <HI>Your &s;ins have &s;epara|ted between you and your God</HI>; and &s;ince then,
<PB N="14" REF="000960_0017_0FADE40D4B4D3FE0">
that is a proper title of &s;inful men in their na|tural &s;tate, <HI>P&s;al</HI> 73 27. <HI>They that are far from thee.</HI> God is no longer his portion; of a friend he is become his enemy; all tho&s;e Glo|rious Attributes which when for him, would have filled him with &s;atisfaction, are now ar|med again&s;t him, and become a terror to him, being ready to de&s;troy him: and if this be not retrieved he cannot e&s;cape perdition.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Gods free Grace con&s;tituted Chri&s;t in the Of|fice of a Mediator, that he might procure life and happine&s;s again for man.</HI> Sin had brought man under the Guilt of Death, binding him over to &s;uffer eternal vengeance. Gods Ju&s;tice was now engaged to execute an holy revenge up|on him, for the affront which he had offered to his Law. This Ju&s;tice mu&s;t be &s;atisfied; man can no more approach to God but by a Mediator, for without one, <HI>God is a con&s;uming fire.</HI> God graciou&s;ly re&s;olves to bring &s;ome of that unhappy race back again to him&s;elf, and be a fountain of life unto them, and herein to manife&s;t his rich Grace; for this end he ap|pointed his own Son to become man, and in our nature to bring about an Atonement, by reconciling God and man one to another and procuring a Redemption for us; for this he put Chri&s;t into his Office, and indented with him in the Days of Eternity: <HI>the coun&s;el of peace</HI> is therefore &s;aid to be <HI>between them both, Zech.</HI> 6.13.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>How it comes to be thus opened?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We may come at this in the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This fountain was provided on purpo&s;e for the Salvation of undone Sinners.</HI> It was for the ad|vancement of the riches of his Grace that God contrived it before time; and it was becau&s;e &s;in had made man to &s;tand in ab&s;olute need of it that God revealed it to him in time, hence that <HI>Rom</HI> 5 6. <HI>When we were without &s;trength, in due time Chri&s;t died for the ungodly; Gal.</HI> 4.4. <HI>When the fulne&s;s of time was come, God &s;ent forth his Son,</HI> &amp;c. Had not man plunged him&s;elf into mi|&s;ery,
<PB N="29" REF="000960_0032_0FADE41B79E35DD0">
and helple&s;sne&s;s in him&s;elf, or in the whole Creation, there had been no occa&s;ion for it. Hence we have Chri&s;t him&s;elf decla|ring the de&s;ign of his coming in our nature, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9 13. <HI>I am not come to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance</HI>; and our Prophet ac|quaints us what the Blood of the Covenant was for, <HI>Zech.</HI> 9.11. <HI>By the Blood of thy Cove|nant, I have &s;ent forth thy pri&s;oners out of the pit, where there is no water</HI>; and that <HI>blood</HI> was no other than what our Text and Doctrine call a <HI>fountain.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Sinners may obtain Salvation by it; they mu&s;t partake in it.</HI> There mu&s;t not only be a remedy &s;uitable and &s;ufficient provided, but there mu&s;t be an application made of it, if ever the Creatures mi&s;ery be removed by it. Let there be never &s;o full a fountain, never &s;o much plenty of living waters, yet if the man do not drink of them, his thir&s;ty Soul will not be &s;atisfied therewith, but he mu&s;t peri&s;h for all. It is not enough that there is a Chri&s;t who is able to give eternal life, who is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, but we mu&s;t have him if we live by him, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.12. <HI>He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life</HI>: Except the man drink of the&s;e waters they will never profit him; what el&s;e is the rea&s;on why &s;o many peri&s;h, tho there be enough in Chri&s;t to &s;ave the whole world? Chri&s;t him&s;elf hath told us a rea&s;on
<PB N="30" REF="000960_0033_0FADE41CF77FAC10">
of it in regard of &s;uch as live under the Go&s;|pel, <HI>viz. they will not come to him that they may have life, Joh.</HI> 5.40. For it is by participati|on in it, that the vertue of Chri&s;t's Redempti|on becomes ours.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is by being united to Chri&s;t by faith that they come to partake in him.</HI> Union with Chri&s;t is the foundation of Communion with him, and faith is the bond of that Union on our part: he mu&s;t dwell in us, in order to his communicating of his &s;aving benefits to us, and how that is we are told, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.17. <HI>That Chri&s;t may dwell in your hearts by faith.</HI> Hence the Apo&s;tle propounds that &s;olemn ca&s;e, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5. <HI>Know you not your own &s;elves, how that Chri&s;t is in you, except ye are reprobates?</HI> It is by faith that we receive Chri&s;t; unbelief &s;huts him out, and &s;o hinders us of all &s;aving good by him; if we believe not in him, we &s;hall never receive the waters of life from him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That they may thus believe in him, they mu&s;t have him Opened to them.</HI> Faith is the act of a rea&s;onable creature, and &s;o it mu&s;t have a ground for it, <HI>Paul</HI> can &s;ay. <HI>I know whom I have tru&s;ted,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 1.12 Hence,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He mu&s;t be opened by</HI> Revelation. There mu&s;t be a di&s;covery made of him to and in the Soul, by which it may be certified of his fulne&s;s and &s;uitablene&s;s; that he is able to an|&s;wer the Souls wants, and to &s;upply its needs, to fill its cravings, and remedy its mi&s;eries:

<P N="2">2. <HI>He hath recorded them in his written Word.</HI> In that he hath commended his mind to us,
<PB N="32" REF="000960_0035_0FADE41E50B47958">
and hath bidden us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o <HI>Search the Scriptures,</HI> as we h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe <HI>to have Eternal Life,</HI> and hath given us this rea&s;on why we &s;hould thus do, <HI>becau&s;e they te&s;tifie of him, Joh.</HI> 5.39.

<P N="3">3. <HI>He hath appointed the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel in which the&s;e truths are to be di&s;pen&s;ed.</HI> He hath in&s;tituted the Preaching of the Go&s;|pel, and &s;ent his Amba&s;&s;adors Commi&s;&s;ioned by him for this very end, and that is the great bu&s;ine&s;s which they are to intend, and nothing el&s;e but what is in &s;ubordina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion to this, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2&punc;2. <HI>I determined to know nothing among you, but Je&s;us Christ, and him Crucified</HI>; and how doth <HI>Paul</HI> glory in this, <HI>Eph</HI> 3.8. <HI>Unto me, who am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all Saints, is this grace given that</HI> I <HI>&s;hould preach among the Gen|til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t.</HI> They are to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">clare this fountain, and to commend it unto men, and pray them to come to it; and thus it &s;tands open for all that will repair to it.</P>

<P><HI>A</HI> We are by the days of the Go&s;pel to under&s;tand all that time from Chri&s;t's having appeared in the Fle&s;h, and accompli&s;hed the
<PB N="33" REF="000960_0036_0FADE41F5C2BEDE8">
work of Redemption, till the day of Judg+ment: which is called the <HI>Go&s;pel day,</HI> in oppo|&s;ition to the times of the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>: el&s;e it is certain that it hath been a Go&s;pel day, ever &s;ince the Revelation which was made to our Fir&s;t Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nts, <HI>of the womans &s;eed breaking the head of the Serpent, Gen.</HI> 3.15. And here we may ob&s;erve three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is clear from the Word of God, that this fountain was opened to man, before Christ came in our Fle&s;h.</HI> There was a way of Salvation di&s;|covered unto man, pre&s;ently after he had un|done him&s;elf by &s;in; and there were a great many &s;aved by the vertue of this fountain in the times of the Law: there were then holy men, who were the <HI>Friends of God, men after his own heart,</HI> men that <HI>tru&s;ted in him, and waited for his Salvation.</HI> There were Prophe|&s;ies and Predictions about Chri&s;t from the be|ginning, and tho&s;e that then believed on him as their <HI>Redeemer, they &s;aw his day and were glad,</HI> they prayed in his name, they had an eye to him in all the Types and Figures which were of him: for that was a truth from the beginning, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. <HI>Neither is there Salvation in any other.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There was a peculiar opening of it after &s;uch time as Chri&s;t had wrought out the work ef Redemption for us.</HI> The word of God is wont to make mention of things as if they were

new, when there is a new manner of the Di&s;pen&s;ation of them, or when there are very eminent degrees of the manife&s;tati|on of them unto men: Now, with re&s;pect to the opening of this fountain, it was thus after Chri&s;t had fini&s;hed the great affair of &s;atisfying the Ju&s;tice of God for us, and went to his glory; and that in two regards;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In re&s;pect to the Clearne&s;s of the di&s;covery.</HI> Tho&s;e manife&s;tations which were made of Chri&s;t under the Law, were very ob&s;cure; almo&s;t all that was there &s;poken about him, was under <HI>Types</HI> and <HI>Figures,</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies.</HI> Every thing then had a vail upon it, and few were able to &s;ee through it; and &s;o they were exceeding ready to tarry at and take up with the &s;hadows in&s;tead of the &s;ub&s;tance; and by that Law, which was given to be a <HI>School-ma&s;ter</HI> to lead them <HI>to Chri&s;t,</HI> to fortify them&s;elves again&s;t him and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.2, 3. <HI>They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge, for being ignorant of Gods Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and going about to establi&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, they have not &s;ubmitted to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God.</HI> So that this foun|tain was then in a great mea&s;ure covered, but now it is di&s;covered gloriou&s;ly, and every thing concerning Chri&s;t and Salvation by him is &s;poken plainly; 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 3.18 <HI>We all with open face beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame Image, from glory to glory.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In re&s;pect to the Extent of the offer that is
<PB N="35" REF="000960_0038_0FADE422D02AEE68">
made of it.</HI> Before the Go&s;pel times, Chri&s;t was in &s;ome re&s;pects a <HI>fountain &s;hut up&punc; and &s;eal|ed</HI>; he was opened only to the Nation of the Jews, and &s;uch as were Pro&s;elyted to them; and that al&s;o ob&s;curely: the <HI>Law of Ordinan|ces</HI> was a <HI>partition wall</HI> between the Jews and other people, &s;o that this was their peculiar pri|viledge and prerogative; <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.2. <HI>To them were committed the Oracles of God; Chap.</HI> 9.4.5. <HI>Who are I&s;raelites, to whom pertaineth the Adoption, &amp; the Glory, &amp; the Covenants, &amp; the giving of the Law,</HI> &amp;c.

Acts</HI> 13.46. But now the partition wall is pulled down, the Law of Ordinances is removed, and there is a way opened for others to come to him, and have peace in him, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.14, 15. <HI>He is our peace, hav|ing made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us,</HI> &amp;c.

times then compared with ours; but if we had been born of and among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> we had been &s;hut out from that Garden in which this fountain was made to &s;pring up.

Let it be to encourage thir&s;ty Souls to come unto Chri&s;t for all they want.</HI> God is wont, in order to his revealing of Chri&s;t to, and in Sinners, to awaken in them a deep &s;en&s;e of their mi&s;ery, and to bring them into &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s: they are made to feel them&s;elves peri&s;hing in them&s;elves, and thereupon their craving Souls are inqui&s;itive whether there be no help to be had for them. Are you then brought into &s;uch a &s;trait as this is, let the following advice be acceptable to you.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let your felt want put you upon asking after him.</HI> Before you were under the impre&s;&s;ion

of the&s;e Convictions, you &s;aw no need that you had of him, and that made you to be &s;o far from &s;eeking after him, that when he came and offered him&s;elf to you, and bad you to accept of him, you put him away from you, and bad him be gone, made it evident that you had no de&s;ire of him; but now let your enquiry be how you may come at him. Your Wells in which you before put your tru&s;t, are now &s;en&s;ibly dried up, and afford you no &s;upply at all, ask then after this foun|tain. Let this be your &s;upport under your pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, that you have heard of &s;uch an one, and now make it your bu&s;ine&s;s to en|quire how you may be made to partake in it, how you may get a full draught of the&s;e <HI>li|ving waters.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let this fulne&s;s of &s;ufficiency be your directi|on to go to him and no where el&s;e.</HI> Every one that would partake in this benefit, and not fail of this Grace of God, mu&s;t re&s;olve to for&s;ake all the &s;treams which before they took up withal, for the &s;ake of the fountain; and the prime motive to this, is the apprehen&s;ion they have of the emptine&s;s of every thing el&s;e, and his infinite fulne&s;s. Receive then the witne&s;s that is born of him in his word, and &s;ee how worthy he is of your tru&s;t, <HI>who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, Eph.</HI> 3.20. Say, I have tried other objects, and they have failed me, but I

have heard that there is enough for me in him; I will therefore go to him, and him only for &s;upply.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let his being opened be your encouragement to prevail with you to come to him, and believe on him.</HI> And indeed, here is that which next|ly animates poor thir&s;ty Souls to come to him. It is true, if he were not a fountain of Grace, he could not an&s;wer our nece&s;&s;ity, and make us happy; our cravings can be filled with no|thing that is le&s;s; but &s;till, if this fountain were &s;hut up and &s;ealed, and there were no way di&s;coverable by which we might come at it, the other con&s;ideration would afford a poor &s;upport to our hope. Goodne&s;s indeed is the object of our <HI>de&s;ire,</HI> but it is the com|municablene&s;s of this goodne&s;s which nextly excites our <HI>hope,</HI> and that is it which mu&s;t car|ry us forth vigorou&s;ly in que&s;t of it: and the more fully this way of participation is mani|fe&s;ted to us, and the more freely it is offered in the exhibition of it, the greater mu&s;t the encouragement needs be. Here therefore is the great demur that &s;en&s;ible Souls are wont to make, <HI>viz.</HI> Is there any way for me to be made a partaker in all this good whereof there is &s;uch an abundance in the fountain?</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>It is certain that this fountain is not in any &s;en&s;e opened to all the world.</HI> There is a two|fold opening of it, which might have been ob&s;erved, <HI>viz</HI> there is that which is <HI>outward,</HI> by the promulgation of the Go&s;pel, and that which is <HI>inward,</HI> made by the Illumination of the Spirit.

latter.

<P><HI>USE I.

There is a <HI>common love</HI> of God, in which the whole Creation is a &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, appearing in his <HI>benignity</HI> in be&s;towing on them the&s;e favours by which they are pre|&s;erved, &s;upplied, and comforted; to this is to be referred that, <HI>Acts</HI> 14 17 <HI>He did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, filling our hearts with food and gladne&s;s</HI>; and <HI>Chap</HI> 17 25 <HI>He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.</HI> But then there is a <HI>&s;pecial love</HI> which God hath for &s;ome of his Creatures, and that was in appointing, providing, and o|pening this fountain for them, from which they may derive everla&s;ting life. This there|fore is mentioned in the Go&s;pel with an <HI>Em|pha&s;is,</HI> as if it were the only love, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4 9.
<PB N="59" REF="000960_0062_0FADE5FD0971B598">
<HI>In this was the love of God manife&s;ted to us,</HI> &amp;c. &amp; <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. <HI>God &s;o loved the world,</HI> &amp;c. Certainly then this love of God to tho&s;e for whom it was prepared mu&s;t be great beyond conception: <HI>Paul</HI> thus &s;ignalizeth the love of Chri&s;t to him, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.20. <HI>Who loved me, and gave him&s;elf for me.</HI> Now it is certain that this fountain was ordained for the &s;aving be|nefit of tho&s;e, and only tho&s;e whom God or|dained to eternal life by Chri&s;t; but for who&s;e &s;ake it had never been.

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Covenant of Works, and the Sanctions of it.</HI> That there was &s;uch a Covenant plighted with man, the Word of God gives us &s;ufficient intimations of: and as it was re|qui&s;ite that man &s;hould be a cau&s;e by Coun&s;el of his own actions, or el&s;e he could not have,

Now in this Covenant there are con&s;iderable the <HI>Sanctions</HI> of it, but for which man could not have been happy or mi&s;erable according to it, and his carriage of him&s;elf towards it. God therefore, be&s;ides a Rule which he gave to man directing him how he might &s;erve him aright, annexed a promi&s;e of life in ca&s;e of Obedience full and perfect, and threatned him with death if he &s;hould tran&s;gre&s;s the precept; which is intimated in that, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2&punc; 17. <HI>In the day that thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;hall &s;urely dy</HI>; and thus man, under the fir&s;t Cove|nant, &s;tood a probationer for life or death according as he &s;hould behave him&s;elf.</P>

unto eternal life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI> And that God had a re&s;pect unto this in appointing Chri&s;t to be a Redeemer and Saviour, is not to be doubted, ina&s;much as this was the very thing from which he was to redeem and &s;ave us: this therefore is &s;aid to commend that Grace, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.8. <HI>God commen|deth his love towards us, in that while we were yet &s;inners, Chri&s;t died for us.</HI> God therefore mu&s;t needs have a fore&s;ight of this Apo&s;ta&s;y, becau&s;e the a&s;&s;ignation of Chri&s;t to his Media|torial Offices had a re&s;pect to it; and that man had not fallen but by Divine Permi&s;&s;i|on, is certain: for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> could have kept him from it, without offering force to his free will, as he did the glorious Angels that keep their Station, as he doth the perfected Saints in Glory, and as he doth true Believ|ers in this life from final Apo&s;ta&s;y; and this <HI>Permi&s;&s;ion</HI> mu&s;t needs flow from his will, be|cau&s;e he is the Supream Governour of all Creatures, and all their actions, according to his holy plea&s;ure.

<P N="4">4 <HI>The mi&s;erable e&s;tate to which he is reduced by the fall, by vertue of the Cur&s;e of the Law.</HI> If man had retained his uprightne&s;s, he had never been mi&s;erable, and &s;o had not &s;tood in need of <HI>Mercy,</HI> but all mi&s;eries are contain|ed

reconciling the world to him&s;elf</HI>; which reconci|liation could be made in no other way, but by the removal of that which had made the di&s;tance, which was nothing el&s;e but &s;in, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 59.2. <HI>Your iniquities have &s;eparated between you and your God.</HI> It was becau&s;e &s;in had made the world an Ho&s;pital, that Chri&s;t was &s;ent into it to come as an healer, a <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> and &s;o he compares him&s;elf, in <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.13.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of his Humiliation was to enable him thus to do.</HI> Chri&s;t was not only to be the Phy&s;ician, but the Phy&s;ick too; all the &s;anative vertue by which Souls whom &s;in had deadlily wounded, might be cured, mu&s;t proceed from him: there mu&s;t there|fore be &s;uch a vertue in him; and there mu&s;t be an infinite <HI>fulne&s;s</HI> of it, that it might ex|tend to all &s;in, and compleatly heal Sinners of it. He mu&s;t <HI>be able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, Heb.</HI> 7.25. And for this he mu&s;t be a Divine per&s;on, cloathed with an Humane nature, and in that nature he mu&s;t accompli&s;h all that which was nece&s;&s;ary for the fitting of him unto this great work. Now this he did in his &s;tate of Humiliation; the application of this belongs e&s;pecially to his Exalted State, <HI>Acts</HI> 5.31. <HI>Him hath God exalted,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to give Repentance to I&s;rael, and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins</HI>; but he laid in for it in his humbled &s;tate, which was therefore introductory to the other, as we are told in <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.7, 8, 9. In this he made the
<PB N="87" REF="000960_0090_0FADE616962A1668">
atonement, without which Guilt could never have been removed; hitherto belongs that, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21.

<P N="3">3. <HI>That the Rea&s;on of this was, becau&s;e there were &s;ome that needed it, whom God purpo&s;ed to make partakers in the benefits of it.</HI> As, if mans &s;in had not brought him to that exigency, that without &s;uch a fountain he mu&s;t have pe|ri&s;hed for ever, Chri&s;t had not come; &s;o, if God had not re&s;olved to impart the efficacy of it to &s;ome &s;uch nece&s;&s;itous ones, he would never have been at the charge of providing it.

a time come when there &s;hall be a National return of them to God, and they &s;hall accept of Chri&s;t for their Lord and Saviour. The truth of this hath been, and &s;till is denyed, and &s;trenuou&s;ly oppugned by &s;ome; and the &s;eemingly long delay of it, hath made many to he&s;itate about it; and it is not to be won|dred at, for Chri&s;t predicted, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18.8. <HI>When the Son of Man cometh, &s;hall he find faith on the Earth?</HI> Which &s;ome have interpreted to have a re&s;pect to the belief of this truth.

<P N="4">4. <HI>That God draws the man to exert the&s;e Graces in Active Conver&s;ion, after the manner of a Rational Agent.</HI> In the exerting of Grace, the man is not only <HI>active,</HI> but <HI>voluntary</HI> too; he acts as a cau&s;e by Coun&s;el.

<P N="5">5. <HI>In this Conver&s;ion the Soul betakes it &s;elf to Chri&s;t by faith, as to a Fountain opened for Sin and for Uncleanne&s;s.</HI> The great Grace celebra|ted in the Go&s;pel is <HI>Faith,</HI> by which we clo&s;e with Chri&s;t for life, wherein we comply with the main Article of the New-Covenant; and therefore Salvation is a&s;certained to it, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. <HI>Who&s;oever believes in him, &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life.</HI> This Grace is not before the others in being, though it leads in the exerci&s;e, and doth indeed influence all the o|ther, being that which fetcheth in help from Chri&s;t for the acting of them. Now Chri&s;t is the immediate Object on whom Faith fix|eth; it believes in him for all the good that it wants, and &s;eeth to be &s;tored in him; and that which draws it &s;o to rely on him, is the di&s;covery it hath made of his &s;ufficiency and readine&s;s to an&s;wer its great nece&s;&s;ity; which is, to be delivered from the guilt and defile|ment of &s;in; and that becau&s;e it apprehends all this to be fountained in him, that it may be communicated by him to all tho&s;e that &s;tand in need of it; and this it doth upon the invitation given in the Go&s;pel, to all that are

<P N="6">6. <HI>This</HI> Faith <HI>is always accompanied with true</HI> Repentance. In active Conver&s;ion the&s;e two Graces are in conjunction. I &s;hall not here meddle with the di&s;putes, which of the&s;e two Graces is the fir&s;t: if we &s;peak of their pro|duction, they are together, and &s;o there is no priority of any Grace, they being created in the &s;ame in&s;tant: if we &s;peak of the order of nature in their activity, Faith mu&s;t have the precedency, becau&s;e it influenceth all the o|ther; for though there is a <HI>Legal Repentance</HI> before Conver&s;ion, yet that which is <HI>Evangeli|cal</HI> follows upon it, and is no further plea&s;ing to God, than as it is exerci&s;ed by faith: but in re&s;pect to order of time, the man repents and believes at once, and &s;o they are together. It is a penitent Faith, and a believing Repen|tance that is exerted; they are therefore con|joyned, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.21. <HI>Te&s;tifying both to the Jews, and al&s;o to the Greeks, Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>For the right exerting of the&s;e Graces, there is the exerci&s;e of a Spirit of Mourning, and of Supplication.</HI> There is a principle of this, or there is &s;uch a Spirit habitually put into the man when he is new made, but the improve|ment of it is in the practi&s;ing of Faith and Repentance. Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>For the exerting of true Repentance, he draws
<PB N="136" REF="000960_0139_0FADE5BA381617E0">
out a Spirit of mourning.</HI> In Repentance we turn from &s;in to God, in which turning, there is not only an ab&s;tinence from the outward acts, but a cordial renouncing and for&s;aking of tho&s;e &s;ins which we rightly repent of; and for that end we mu&s;t be made to &s;ee them to be evil and mi&s;chievous, and that we have foo|li&s;hly turned from God to them; the genuine effect whereof upon the heart, is to bemoan our &s;elves by rea&s;on of them: and hence the Scripture annexeth mourning unto Repen|tance, as an in&s;eparable concomitant of it, hence that in, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.18. <HI>I have &s;urely heard Ephraim bemoaning of him&s;elf, &amp;c.</HI> And for the producing of this mourning, God offers the conviction of the evil and bitterne&s;s there is in our &s;ins, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.19. <HI>Know and &s;ee that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou ha&s;t for&s;aken the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</HI> Now there are two pa&s;&s;ages to be ob&s;erved in this mourning.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He bewails all his Sins.</HI> Godly Sorrow is for Sin: that is the procuring cau&s;e of all the &s;orrows that poor man is expo&s;ed unto, and is therefore that which peculiarly calls for our mourning; and this belongs to that &s;or|row which the Apo&s;tle tells us is &s;o &s;ervicea|ble to true Repentance, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.10, <HI>Godly &s;orrow worketh repentance not to be repented of.</HI> It is by this that we embitter &s;in to our &s;elves, and &s;tir up in us an hatred of it: for, though &s;orrow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e a mixt Affection, yet it mainly
<PB N="137" REF="000960_0140_0FADE5BB6B2B6828">
partakes of hatred, which is a &s;eparating af|fection, and makes us to reject the Object of it. Now if this &s;orrow be genuine, it is univer&s;al; it bears a re&s;pect to all &s;in; becau&s;e if it be right, it is exci|ted by the apprehen&s;ion of the great evil there is in &s;in, in the nature, as well as in the effects of it; which evil being in all &s;in, it mu&s;t needs extend to all: hence that, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 119.104. <HI>I hate every fal&s;e way</HI>; and where this hatred is, there will be Sorrow for our having hurt our &s;elves by it, and therein di&s;|honoured God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He more peculiarly laments the affronts that he hath offered to Chri&s;t, who hath been &s;et before him in the tenders of Grace.</HI> This therefore is peculiarly remarked in, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. <HI>They &s;hall look upon him whom they have pierced, and they &s;hall mourn for him, as one mourneth for an only Son, and be in bitterne&s;s for him, as one is in bit|terne&s;s for his first born.</HI> Where the Go&s;pel comes, and Chri&s;t is exhibited, together with the need that men have of him by rea&s;on of Sin; the convictions whereof are laid before men to per&s;wade them of the nece&s;&s;ity they &s;tand in of having him to be their Saviour; and men have made light of there invitations which have been given them; they have not been per&s;waded of their mi&s;ery by Sin, and brought to accept of Chri&s;t to re&s;cue them from it, and have accordingly de&s;pi&s;ed

<P N="2">2. <HI>For the exerci&s;ing of Faith, this Spirit of mourning is ever accompanied with a Spirit of Supplication.</HI> The fir&s;t breathings and break|ings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orth of faith, are in prayer.

<P N="1">1. <HI>Have you ever felt the bitterne&s;s of Sin it &s;elf?</HI> Many an one finds &s;orrow by his &s;ins, and is forced to acknowledge that his Sin hath brought it upon him, who yet is not led by it to &s;ee and believe that Sin is in its own nature &s;o vile and evil as to be odious. It may be he only reads it in the Law, and he &s;ees that God will maintain his own Law; but mean while he lays the blame, not on the &s;in that procu|red his &s;orrow, but on the Law that had &s;uch a Sanction in it: and he is therefore &s;orry for his &s;in, only becau&s;e he is &s;orry that there is

<P N="2">2. <HI>Have you been deeply oppre&s;sed with the burden of &s;in, &s;o as thereby to be made weary of it?</HI> Though God improves the troubles and mi&s;chiefs procured by Sin, to bring us to &s;ee the evil of it, and cry out by rea&s;on of the bitterne&s;s there is in it, yet in a kindly mour|ning, &s;in it &s;elf is made to be a burden that we cannot tell how to bear, and hereupon we long to be rid of it, and earne&s;tly &s;eek after a freedom from it; thus it was with <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 7 24. <HI>Oh wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI> We &s;eek a pardon, for we are undone without it: but we &s;eek the death of Sin too, nor can we be at quiet, but in the a&s;&s;urance and expe|rience of the beginning of it in us, and a com|fortable per&s;wa&s;ion that it will ere long be wholly de&s;troyed: hence that groan of his, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 38.4. <HI>Mine iniquities are gone over mine head, as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hath your mourning reached to, and fixed upon the &s;in of your nature?</HI> It is not enough to have bewailed this or that particular actual Sin, although God u&s;ually makes the conviction

of, and the &s;orrow for &s;uch, to be leading to the other: but he that hath truly mourned for Sin, hath been led up from thence to the fountain of corruption which is within, and that hath driven him to &s;eek after the Foun|tain of Grace which is in Chri&s;t: and always true mourning cea&s;eth not, till it cometh hi|ther, and lays out its greate&s;t lamentations here: thus it did in <HI>David,</HI> in the forecited, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.5.

<P N="4">4. <HI>Hath this &s;orrow wrought in you unto a true Repentance from Sin?

<P N="5">5. <HI>Hath this &s;orrow kindled in you an univer&s;al hatred of Sin?</HI> When God embitters &s;in to us, it is to make us to loath it; and if this ha|tred be of the right &s;tamp, it will not only be again&s;t that one &s;in that hath done us the pre|&s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;en&s;ible harm, but all of the kind, but eve|ry thing that bears the nature of &s;in on it; we can &s;ay as he, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.104. <HI>I hate every fal&s;e way.</HI> And the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e, if we mourned for &s;in under the con&s;ideration of its being &s;in, we &s;hall be engaged again&s;t every other &s;in, in which we &s;ee the &s;ame grounds of hatred or dete&s;tation.

<P N="6">6. <HI>Hath your &s;orrow lookt back to the &s;ins of Youth?</HI> Where God doth indeed give a &s;pirit of mourning, he will make a thorough work of it, he will lead the Soul into a &s;oaking con|&s;ideration of all that hath been grievous to his holy &s;pirit; he will bring&punc; to mind old &s;ins, &amp; tho&s;e that had been forgotten before, and em|bitter them to us, and the rea&s;on is becau&s;e tho&s;e &s;ins al&s;o mu&s;t be repented of, for which there mu&s;t be a &s;uitable &s;orrow.

[2.] He lays open the Office and Duty of &s;uch as would approve them&s;elves to be faith|ful and edifying Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, to <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 17. [3.] He a&s;&s;erts the great u&s;eful|ne&s;s of the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> under the Go&s;pel, a&s;&s;u|ring us that his de&s;ign was not to <HI>Aboli&s;h,</HI> but <HI>E&s;tabli&s;h</HI> it; and thereupon proceeds to Vindi|cate the true &s;en&s;e of it from the corrupt and fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Doctors to the end of the Chapter.</HI> In which he in&s;i&s;ts upon &s;everal <HI>Articles,</HI> which had been more e&s;pecially de|praved by them: and the words of our <HI>Text</HI> are an Exhortation which he draws from the whole foregoing di&s;cour&s;e; though I know there are &s;ome who needle&s;ly re&s;train it to the next foregoing duty of expre&s;&s;ing our cordial love to our enemies, in oppo&s;ition to the Doctrine of the <HI>Scribes,</HI> who taught <HI>that we &s;hould love our neighbour, and hate our enemy.</HI> I know the words are expre&s;&s;ed in the Future ten&s;e; <HI>Ye &s;hall be perfect</HI>; but yet they are not to be under&s;tood <HI>Promi&s;&s;orily,</HI> as &s;ome do in|terpret them; but <HI>Preceptively,</HI> as an injuncti|on laid upon us. And we have &s;everal like in&s;tances in this <HI>Chapter</HI>; yea &amp; it is frequent in all languages to u&s;e the <HI>Future</HI> for the <HI>Impe|rative:</HI>

You &s;hall do thus or &s;o; intending, I require or command you &s;o to do.</P>
<P>In the words, be&s;ides the <HI>Illation, therefore,</HI> which refers to the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e, there are two parts;</P>
<P N="1">1. A duty enjoyned; <HI>Be ye perfect.</HI> The &s;ubject of this command are Chri&s;ts <HI>Di&s;ciples, ver&s;e</HI> 1. The thing required is perfection; which, what it is, will be afterward con&s;ider|ed.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Pattern which is &s;et before us to follow, in our e&s;&s;ayes after this perfection; <HI>as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</HI> So that here the Divine perfection is propo&s;ed to us for our imitation; and an argument is u&s;ed to urge it from the con&s;ideration of that rela|tion which he bears to us, he is our Father in heaven; and Children are apt to take after their Parents. Hence that, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.15, 16. <HI>As he which hath called you is holy, &s;o be ye holy in all manner of conver&s;ation; becau&s;e it is writ|ten, be ye Holy, for I am Holy.</HI> Here is not an equality intended, but a &s;imilitude, together with &s;uch a mea&s;ure as the Creature is capable of attaining unto: for the greate&s;t perfections of the mo&s;t excellent Creatures, are imperfe|ctions, compared with God. Nor are all the Divine Perfections here intended: there are tho&s;e that are by Divines called <HI>Incommunicable,</HI> which we are to admire, but not to a&s;pire af|ter; and there are tho&s;e which are &s;aid to be
<PB N="170" REF="000960_0173_0FADE5DD57142848">
<HI>Communicable:</HI> Namely, &s;uch whereof there may be an Image, or dark repre&s;entation in us; and the&s;e are here aimed at. The&s;e per|fections con&s;i&s;t in that <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> and <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> which are required in the Moral Law, un|to which we are enabled by the Sanctification of the Spirit, the Graces whereof in us are called, the <HI>Image of God</HI>; by which we imi|tate him in his Holine&s;s, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s. That the Duty here required is <HI>Evangelical</HI>; therein appears, becau&s;e Chri&s;t enjoyneth it on his Di&s;ciples, and &s;uch as can call God their Father, by vertue of the <HI>Adoption,</HI> which we are told cometh in upon believing, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.26. <HI>For we are the Children of God, through faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The only matter of difficulty before us, is to know what is the perfection intended by Chri&s;t in this precept, and which he requireth and expecteth that all tho&s;e who approve them&s;elves to be his <HI>Di&s;ciples,</HI> &s;hould be always a&s;piring after. And that which makes it the more difficult, is becau&s;e the word is variou&s;ly u&s;ed in the Scriptures, and differently applied by Expo&s;itors to this <HI>Text.</HI> The word &s;igni|fyeth, that which hath attained its end; and, becau&s;e when a thing hath &s;o done, it hath reached its perfection according to its capacity, it is <HI>Metonymically</HI> u&s;ed for it: and &s;o, one that is adult, or grown up to his full <HI>Stature,</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>a perfect man, Eph.</HI> 4.13.

They &s;peak al&s;o of a <HI>Relative</HI> or <HI>Comparative</HI> perfection, when, though a thing be in it &s;elf defective, yet when it is compared with another of its own kind, it doth very much exceed or go beyond it; and that which is <HI>Ab&s;olute,</HI> which is when it is improved to its utmo&s;t capacity; &amp; they ob&s;erve that perfection is &s;ometimes u&s;ed for <HI>Sincerity,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI>; when a man not only profe&s;&s;eth Godline&s;s, but is the man he pretends to be, &s;uch an one is &s;ound or perfect, whereas the other is un&s;ound, and &s;o imperfect.

doth not contradict him&s;elf in his word. Now, though it be ea&s;ily granted on all hands, that Chri&s;t requires <HI>Sincerity,</HI> or an <HI>Upright Heart</HI> of us, yea and <HI>Integrity</HI> too, or a cordial <HI>re&s;pect</HI> to be expre&s;&s;ed to all his <HI>Commands</HI>; and he will accept of &s;uch &s;inceri|ty and integrity at the hands of his people in the&s;e duties which they perform in faith, &s;eek|ing for their acceptance in Chri&s;t: in which re&s;pect, I &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>Evangelical</HI> Obedience doth mainly differ from that which is <HI>Legal,</HI> and God is plea&s;ed with it, when he rejects the other; yet, how far, <HI>ab&s;olute perfection</HI> is comprized in the precept here given by Chri&s;t, is a matter of doubt and debate a|mong many. There are, and tho&s;e not a few, who with greate&s;t confidence do a&s;&s;ert, that God doth not expect or require of his people, under the Go&s;pel Covenant, that perfection in their Obedience to him, which he did un|der the <HI>Covenant of Works</HI>; but hath abated of the &s;trictne&s;s of the Command; and if we do our be&s;t, there is no more required of us.

Now, as it was the glory of his <HI>Grace</HI> that God had a regard to ultimately in this Contrivance; &s;o the way in which he would exalt this Attribute, and make it illu&s;tri|ous and for ever admirable, was in their Salva|tion: So that the Salvation of lo&s;t Sinners is in&s;eparably connected with, and nextly &s;ub|ordinated to this la&s;t end of God; becau&s;e in and by it he will accompli&s;h it. In which Salvation they are delivered from that mi&s;ery under which they were fallen by rea&s;on of &s;in, unto all that felicity which they had &s;o lo&s;t; hence we are told that it is <HI>by Grace that we are &s;aved, Eph.</HI> 2 8. on which account it is called <HI>the Grace of God which brings Salvati+on, Tit.</HI> 2 11.
