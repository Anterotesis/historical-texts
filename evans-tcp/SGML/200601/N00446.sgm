<P>It is an odd S <HI>uperstition</HI> which the <HI>Indians</HI> of this countrey have among them, that they count it (on the penalty of otherwise <HI>never prospering</HI> more) necessary for them, never to pass by the <HI>Graves</HI> of certain famous persons a|mong them, without laying and leaving some Token of Regard thereupon.

<P>'Tis the Life of the Renowned John Eliot, which is to be now put into our Pages; a Life which Commenced about the Year 1604. And Expi|red, in the Year 1690.</P>

<P>He came to <HI>New-England,</HI> in the Month <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>November. A.

<P>This <HI>Wife of his youth</HI> lived with him until
<PB N="7" REF="000568_0013_0FA7125571AF0650">
she became to him also the <HI>staff of his Age;</HI> and she left him not until about three or four years before his own Departure to those Heavenly Regions where they now together <HI>see Light.</HI> She was a Woman very Eminent, both for <HI>Ho|liness</HI> and <HI>Usefulness,</HI> and she excelled most of the <HI>Daughters that have done vertuously.</HI> Her Name was <HI>Ann,</HI> and <HI>Gracious</HI> was her Nature. God made her a Rich Blessing, not only to her, <HI>Family,</HI> but also to her <HI>Neighbour hood;</HI> and when at last she dyed, I heard and saw her aged Hus|band, who else very rarely wept, yet now with Tears over the Coffin, before the good people, a vast confluence of which were come to her Funeral, say, <HI>Here lies my dear, faithful, pious, prudent, prayerful Wife; I shall go to her, and she not return to me!</HI> My Reader will of his own ac|cord excuse <HI>me,</HI> from bestowing any further <HI>E|pitaphs</HI> upon that <HI>gracious</HI> Woman.</P>
<P>By <HI>her,</HI> did God give him six worthy Chil|dren; Children of a character which may for|ever stop the mouths of those <HI>Antichristian</HI> Blas|phemers, who have set a false brand of Disaster and Infamy, on the Offspring of a <HI>Married Cler|gy.</HI> His First born, was a Daughter; born <HI>Sep.</HI> 17. <HI>A.

<P>Mr. Eliots, early Conversion, sacred Employment, and just Removal into America.</P>
<P>But all that I have hitherto said, is no more than an entrance into the History of our <HI>Eliot.</HI> Such an <HI>Enoch</HI> as <HI>he,</HI> must have something more than these things recorded of him; his <HI>Walk with God,</HI> must be more largely laid before the world, as a thing that would bespeak us all to be <HI>Followers</HI> no less than we shall be <HI>Admirers</HI> of it.</P>
<P>He had not passed many <HI>Turns</HI> in the world, before he knew the meaning of a saving <HI>Turn</HI> from the Vanities of an Unregenerate State&punc; unto God in Christ, by a true Repentance; he had the singular happiness and priviledge of an <HI>early Conversion</HI> from the Ways, which <HI>Original Sin</HI> disposes all men unto. One of the princi|pal&punc; Instruments which the God of Heaven used in tingeing, and filling the mind of this <HI>chosen Vessel,</HI> with good principles, was that Venerable <HI>Thomas Hook</HI> whose Name in the Churches of the Lord Jesus, is, <HI>As an Oyntment poured for thy</HI> even that <HI>Hooker,</HI> of whom worthy Master <HI>Ful|ler</HI> could write, <HI>As</HI> Latymer <HI>would not stick it say,</HI> Saint <HI>Belney, so neither I to say,</HI> Saint <HI>Hooker<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> that <HI>Hooker,</HI> who having <HI>Angled</HI> many scores of Souls into the Kingdom of Heaven, at last laid

his Bones in our <HI>New-England;</HI> it was an ac|quaintance with <HI>him,</HI> that contributed more than a little to the Accomplishment of our <HI>Eli|sha,</HI> for that work unto which the most High designed him. His liberal <HI>Education,</HI> having now the Addition of <HI>Religion,</HI> to direct it, and improve it, it gave such a <HI>Biass</HI> to his young Soul, as quickly discovered it self in very signal instances. His first Appearance in the world after his Education in the <HI>University,</HI> was in the too <HI>difficult</HI> and <HI>unthankful</HI> but very <HI>necessary</HI> Em|ployment of a <HI>School-master,</HI> which Employment he discharged with a good fidelity.

<P>SUch was the <HI>Piety</HI> of our <HI>Eliot,</HI> that like a|nother <HI>Moses,</HI> he had upon his <HI>Face</HI> a con|tinual <HI>shine,</HI> arising from his uninterrupted com|munion with the Father of Spirits. He was indeed a <HI>Man of Prayer,</HI> and might say after the Psal|mist,

<HI>I prayer,</HI> as being in a manner made up of it. Could the walls of his old <HI>Study</HI> speak, they would even Ravish us with a Relation of the many hundred and thousand fervent <HI>Prayers</HI> which he there poured out before the Lord. He not only made it his dayly practice to <HI>enter into that closet, and shut his Door, and pray to his Father in Secret,</HI> but he would not rarely <HI>set</HI> a|part whole <HI>days</HI> for prayer with Fasting, in se|cret places before the God of Heaven. <HI>Prayer</HI> solemnized with <HI>Fasting</HI> was indeed so agreea|ble unto him, that I have sometimes thought he might justly inherit the Name of, <HI>Johannes Je|junator,</HI> or, <HI>John the Faster,</HI> which for the like reason was put upon one of the Renowned Ancients. Especially, when there was any re|markable difficulty before him, he took this way to encounter and overcome it; being of Dr. <HI>Prestons</HI> mind, <HI>That when we would have any great things to be accomplished, the best policy is to work by an Engine which the world sees nothing of.</HI> He could say as the pious <HI>Robert son</HI> did upon his Death-bed, <HI>I thank God, I have loved Faster and Prayer, with all my heart!</HI> If one would have known what that sacred thing, <HI>The spirit of Prayer,</HI> intends, in <HI>him</HI> there might have been seen a most luculent and practical Exposition of it.

When he came to an House that he was inti|mately acquainted with, he could often say, <HI>Come, let us not have a visit without a prayer; let us pray down the Blessing of Heaven on your Fami|ly before we go.</HI> Especially when he came into a Society of Ministers, before he had sat long with them, they would look to hear him urging, <HI>Brethren, the Lord Jesus takes much notice of what is done and said among his Ministers when they are together; come, let us pray before we part!</HI> And hence also, his whole <HI>Breath</HI> seem|ed in a sort made up of <HI>ejaculatory prayers,</HI> many scores of which winged Messengers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dispatched away to Heaven, upon pious Er|rands every day. By <HI>them</HI> he bespoke Blessings upon almost every person or affair that he was concerned with; and he carried every thing to God with some pertinent <HI>Hosannah'</HI>s or <HI>Halle|lujah'</HI>s over it. <HI>H</HI>e was a <HI>mighty</HI> and an <HI>happy</HI> man, that had his <HI>Quiver</HI> full of these Heaven|ly <HI>Arrows!</HI> and when he was never so straitly besieged by Humane Occurrences, yet he fastned the wishes of his devout Soul unto them, and very dexterously shot them up to Heaven over the head of all.</P>

<P>When first I engaged in that work, I intend|ed not to have spoken one word about the <HI>pra|ctical Observation</HI> of the Day; but only to have endeavoured the <HI>Revival</HI> of a Truth which at present is despised and contemned among <HI>us,</HI> and strenuously opposed by sundry Divines of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> who call the Doctrine of the Sabbath, <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gmenium Anglicanism.</HI> Upon the Desire of some Learned Men in these parts, it was, that I undertook the Vindicati|on of it.

<P>I suppose there is scarce any one alive in the world, who hath more <HI>Reproaches</HI> cast upon him than I have; tho hitherto God has been pleased in some measure to support my spirit under them. I still relieved my self by this, That my poor Endeavours have sound accep|tance with the <HI>Churches</HI> of Christ: But my ho|ly, wise, and gracious Father, sees it needful to try me in this matter also; and what I have received from you (which it may be contains not <HI>your sense alone</HI>) hath printed deeper, and

I do acknowledge unto you, that I have a dry and barren Spirit, and I do heartily beg your prayers, that the Holy. One would, notwithstanding all my sinful provocations, water me from above; but that I should now be apprehended to have given a wound unto <HI>Holiness</HI> in the Churches, <HI>'tis one of the saddest frowns in the cloudy Brows of Divine Providence.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctrine of the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> I have assert|ed, tho' not as it should be done, yet as well as I could; The <HI>Observation</HI> of it in Holy Du|ties unto the utmost of the strength for them, which God shall be pleased to give us, I have pleaded for; the necessity also of a serious <HI>pre|paration</HI> for it in sundry previous Duties, I have declared.

<P>'Twere impossible to finish the <HI>lively</HI> Picture of this pious and holy <HI>Eliot,</HI> without some touches upon that <HI>Mortification,</HI> which accompa|ny'd him all his days; for never did I see a person more <HI>mortify'd</HI> unto all the pleasures of this Life, or more unwilling to <HI>moult</HI> the wings of an Heaven born Soul, in the dirty puddles of carnal and sensual Delights.

but what estate he became owner of, was from the Blessing of God upon the Husbandry and in|dustry of some in his Family, rather than from any endeavours of his own. Once when there stood several <HI>kine</HI> of his own before his door, his Wife, to try him, asked him, <HI>Whose they were?</HI> and she found that he knew nothing of them.

to furnish themselves with another <HI>Pastor;</HI> and in his Application to them, he told them, <HI>'Tis possible, you may think the burden of maintaining two Ministers may be too heavy for you; but I'll deliver you from that fear; I do here give back my Salary to the Lord Jesus Christ, and now, Brethren, you may fix that upon any man, that God, shall make a pastor for you.</HI> But his Church with an handsome Reply, assured him, That they would count his very <HI>presence</HI> worth a Salary, when he should be so superannuated as to do no further Service for them.</P>
<P>And as for the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ytae of Life,</HI> the <HI>Life</HI> of it was most exemplarily extinguish'd in him. The <HI>Humility</HI> of his <HI>Heart</HI> made him, <HI>Higher by the Head than the rest of the people.</HI> His <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> were both such as declared him to be among the <HI>Lowly,</HI> whom God has most <HI>Ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ects</HI> unto.

<P>HE that will write of <HI>Eliot,</HI> must write of <HI>Charity,</HI> or say nothing. His <HI>Charity</HI> was a Star of the <HI>First Magnitude</HI> in the bright Con|stellation of his Vertues; and the Rays of it were wonderfully various and extensive.</P>
<P>His <HI>Liberality</HI> to pious Uses, whether publick or private, went much beyond the proportions of his little Estate in the world.

remember (but the <HI>Righteous</HI> God <HI>will!</HI>) how <HI>often,</HI> and with what <HI>Ardors,</HI> with what <HI>Argu|ments,</HI> he became a Beggar to them, for Collect|ions in their Assemblies, to support such needy Objects, as had fallen under his Observation. The poor counted him their <HI>Father,</HI> and repair|ed still unto him, with a filial confidence in their Necessities; and they were more than <HI>se|ven</HI> or <HI>eight,</HI> or indeed than so many <HI>scores,</HI> who received their <HI>portions</HI> of his Bounty. Like that worthy and famous <HI>English</HI> General, he could not perswade himself, <HI>That he held any thing but what he gave away;</HI> but he drove a mighty Trade at such Exercises as he thought would furnish him with <HI>Bills of Exchange,</HI> which he ho|ped <HI>after many days</HI> to find the comfort of; and yet after all, he would say like one of the most charitable Souls that ever lived in the World, <HI>That looking over his Accounts, he could no where find the God of Heaven charged a Debtor there.</HI> He did not put off his <HI>Charity,</HI> to be put in his <HI>last Will,</HI> as many who therein shew that their <HI>Charity</HI> is <HI>against their will;</HI> but he was his own <HI>Administrator;</HI> he made his own <HI>Hands</HI> his <HI>Ex|ecutors,</HI> and his own <HI>Eyes</HI> his <HI>Overseers.</HI> It has been Remark'd, That <HI>liberal</HI> men are often <HI>long-lived</HI> men; so do they <HI>after many days</HI> find the <HI>Bread</HI> with which they have been willing to keep other men <HI>alive.</HI> The <HI>great age</HI> of our E|liot was but agreeable to this Remark, &amp; when his Age had unfitted him for almost all Em|ployments,
<PB N="38" REF="000568_0044_0FA712810EAA2680">
and bereaved him of those Gifts &amp; Parts which once he had been Accomplished with, being asked, <HI>How he did?</HI> he would some|times answer, <HI>Alas, I have lost every thing; my Understanding leaves me, my Memory fails me, my Utterance fails me; but I thank God, my Charity holds out still; I find</HI> that <HI>rather grows than fails!</HI> And I make no question, That at his Death, his happy Soul was Received, and welcomed, into the <HI>everlasting Habitations,</HI> by many scores got thither before him, of such as his <HI>Charity</HI> had been liberal unto.</P>
<P>But besides these more <HI>Substantial Expressions</HI> of his <HI>Charity,</HI> hee made the Odours of that <HI>Grace</HI> yet more fragrant unto all that were about him, by that <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">fulness</HI> and that <HI>Peaceableness,</HI> which rendred him yet further Amiable.

It was an extreme Sa|tisfaction to him, that his Wife had attained un|to a considerable skill in <HI>Physick</HI> and <HI>Chyrurgery,</HI> which enabled her to dispense many safe, good, and useful Medicines, unto the <HI>Poor</HI> that had oc|casion for them; and some hundreds of sick &amp; weak and maimed people owed praises to God, for
<PB N="39" REF="000568_0045_0FA712822FE03DA8">
for the Benefit, which therein they freely recei|ved of her. The good Gentleman, her Hus|band would still be casting <HI>Oyl</HI> into the <HI>Flame</HI> of that Charity, wherein she was of her own accord abundantly forward thus to be <HI>doing of good unto all;</HI> and he would urge her to be serviceable into the worst <HI>Enemies</HI> that he had in the world. Never had any man fewer Enemies than he. But once having delivered something in his Mi|nistry, which displeased one of his Hearers, the man did passionately abuse him for it, and this both with <HI>Speeches</HI> and with <HI>Writings</HI> that revi|sed him. Yet it happening not long after, that this man gave himself a very dangerous <HI>Wound,</HI> Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> immediately sends his Wife to cure him; who did accordingly. When the man was well he came to thank her; but she took no Rewards; and this <HI>Good man</HI> made him stay and <HI>eat</HI> with him, taking no notice of all the Ca|lumnies with which he had loaded him; but by, this Carriage he strangely mollifyed and conque|red the <HI>Stomach</HI> of his Reviler.</P>
<P>He was also a great Enemy to all <HI>Contention,</HI> &amp; would ring a loud <HI>Courfeu-Bell</HI> wherever he saw the <HI>Fires</HI> of Animosity. When he heard any Ministers complain, that such and such in their Flocks, were too <HI>difficult</HI> for them, the strain of his Answer still was, <HI>Brother, Compass them!</HI> and <HI>Brother, Learn the meaning of those three little Words, Bear, Forbear, Forgive.</HI> Yea, his In|clinations for <HI>Peace,</HI> indeed sometimes almost

made him to sacrifice <HI>Right</HI> it self. When there was laid before an Assembly of Ministers, a bun|dle of Papers, which contained certain matters of Difference and Contention, between some people which our <HI>Eliot</HI> thought should rather unite, with an <HI>Amnesty</HI> upon all their former Quarrels, he (with some limitation of what <HI>Con|stantine</HI> did upon the like occasion) hastily threw the papers into the Fire before them all, and with a <HI>zeal</HI> for peace, as hot as that <HI>Fire,</HI> said immediately, <HI>Brethren, wonder not at what I have done; I did it on my knees this morning before I came among you.</HI> Such an <HI>excess</HI> (if it were one), flow'd from his Charitable Inclinations to be found among those <HI>Peace-makers</HI> which by following the Exemple of that <HI>Man</HI> who is <HI>our Peace,</HI> come to be called, <HI>The children of God.</HI> Very worthily might he be called an <HI>Ireneus,</HI> as being all for <HI>Peace;</HI> and the Commendation which <HI>Epiphanius</HI> gives unto the Ancient of <HI>that Name,</HI> did belong unto our <HI>Eliot;</HI> he was a <HI>most blessed and a most holy man.</HI> He disliked all sorts of <HI>Bravery;</HI> but yet with an ingenious Note upon the Greek word in <HI>Col.</HI> 3. 15. he propounded, <HI>That peace might</HI> brave it <HI>among us.</HI> In short, where-ever he came, it was like ano|ther old <HI>John,</HI> with solemn and earnest perswa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ives to <HI>love,</HI> and when he could say little else, he would give that Charge, <HI>My Children, love one another!</HI></P>

to continual <HI>Apprecations</HI> for and <HI>Benedictions</HI> on those that he met withal; he had, an <HI>Heart</HI> full of good <HI>Wishes</HI> and a <HI>Mouth</HI> full of kind <HI>Bles|sings</HI> for them.

from the just interpretation of <HI>Idolatry</HI> because of the <HI>antecedent interpretation put upon it by those that first contrived it, enjoyed it, and have hitherto maintained it;</HI> and it affrighted him to read what the Popish Writers assert about <HI>Kneeling,</HI> if the Sacramental Bread remain <HI>Bread</HI> after the Consecration.

<P>It afflicted him to <HI>see these,</HI> and more such as <HI>these,</HI> things continued in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> by the Artifice of certain persons who were loth to have the Refomation carried on unto those further Degrees which the most eminent of the <HI>first Reformers</HI> had in their Holy Designs; and it filled him with a just Horrour, and sorrow! to see above twenty Hundred, faithful Ministers in one <HI>Black Day</HI> turned out of their employ|ments, and several Thousands of Christians and Families in a little while Ruined, because they could not swallow down such unaccountable <HI>superstitions.</HI></P>
<P>We see what <HI>was not</HI> his opinion! but let us hear,
<PB N="65" REF="000568_0071_0FA712A42D4DF620">
what it was. It was <HI>his</HI> as well as his master, the great <HI>Ramus</HI>s principle, <HI>that in the Reformation by Churches to be now endeavoured things ought to be Reduced unto the Order wherein we find them at their Primitive, Original, Apostolical Institution</HI> And in pursuance of this principle, he Justly Epou|sed that way of <HI>Church-Government</HI> which we call, <HI>the Congregational;</HI> he was fully perswaded, that the <HI>Church-state</HI> which our Lord Christ hath instituted in the New Testament, is, <HI>In a Congregation or Society of Professed Believers, A|greeing and Assembling together, among themselves, with Officers, of Divine Appointment, for the Cele|bration of Evangelical Ordinances, and their own mutual Edification;</HI> For he saw it must be a <HI>cru|el hardship</HI> used upon the Scriptures, to make them so much as Lisp the least intimation of any other <HI>Church-state</HI> prescribed unto us; and he could assert, <HI>That no Approved Writers, for the space of two hundred years after Christ, make any mention of any other Organical, Visible, Pro|fessing Church, but that onely which is Congrega|tional.</HI> He look'd upon the <HI>Congregational way</HI> as a Largess of Divine Bounty bestow'd by the Lord Jesus, on his people, that follow'd him into this Wilderness, with a peculiar zeal for Communion with him, in his pure Worship here. He perceived in it, a sweet sort of <HI>Tem|perament,</HI> between <HI>Rigid Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">erianism,</HI> and <HI>Levelling Brownism;</HI> So that on the one side, the <HI>Liberties</HI> of the people are not oppressed and

<P>He could not comprehend, that this <HI>Church|state</HI> can arise from any other <HI>Formal cause,</HI> but the Consent, Concurrence, Confederation of those concerned in it; he looked upon a Re|lation unto a Church, as not a <HI>Natural,</HI> or a <HI>Vi|olent,</HI> but a <HI>Voluntary</HI> thing, and so that it is to be entred no otherwise than by an Holy <HI>Cove|nant,</HI> or, as the Scripture speaks, by <HI>giving our selves first unto the Lord, and then one unto ano|ther.</HI> He could not think, that <HI>Baptism</HI> alone was to be accounted the <HI>cause,</HI> but rather the <HI>effect,</HI> of Church-member-ship; inasmuch as up|on the dissolution of the Church to which a man belongs, his <HI>Baptism</HI> would not become a Nullity: nor that meet <HI>Profession</HI> would render men <HI>members</HI> of this or that C<HI>hurch;</HI> for then it would be impossible to cut off a corrupt mem|ber from that Body Politic: Nor that meet <HI>Co-habitation</HI> would make <HI>Church-members;</HI> for then the vilest infidels would be actually incor|porated with us.

thereby exceedingly Edify'd; and the Souls of <HI>Devout Christians</HI> are hereby very much ingra|tiated one unto another. The <HI>Devil</HI> knows what he does, when he thrusts so hard to get this Custom out of our Churches.

<P>There were especially two things, which he was loth to <HI>see,</HI> and yet fear'd he <HI>saw,</HI> falling in the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI> One was, A thorough Establishment of <HI>Ruling-Elders</HI> in our Churches; which he thought sufficiently warranted by the Apostles mention of, <HI>Elders that Rule well, who yet labour not in Word and Do|ctrine.</HI> He was very desirous to have prudent and gracious men set over our Churches, for the Assistence of their <HI>Pastors,</HI> in the Church acts that concern the <HI>Admission</HI> and <HI>Exclusion</HI> of Members, and the <HI>Inspection</HI> of the Conversation led by the Communicants, and the <HI>Instruction</HI> of their several Families, and the <HI>Visitation</HI> of the Afflicted in the Flock over which they should preside. Such <HI>Helps in Government</HI> had he him|self been blessed withal; the last of which was the well deserving Elder <HI>Bowles;</HI> and of <HI>him,</HI> did this good man, in a Speech to a <HI>Synod</HI> of all the Churches in this Colony, take occasion to

<P>But the mention of a <HI>Synod</HI> brings to mind a|nother thing, which he was Concerned, that we might never want; and that is, a frequent Re|petition of <HI>Needful Synods</HI> in our Churches. For tho' he had a deep and a due care to preserve the <HI>Rights of particular Churches,</HI> yet he thought all the Churches of the Lord Jesus by their <HI>Union</HI> in what they <HI>profess,</HI> in what they <HI>in|tend,</HI> and in what they <HI>enjoy,</HI> so compacted into one <HI>Body Mystical,</HI> as that all the several <HI>par|ticular Churches</HI> every where should <HI>act</HI> with a regard unto the good of the whole, and unto the common <HI>Advice</HI> and <HI>Counsil</HI> of the Neighbourhood; which cannot be done al|ways by <HI>Letters missive,</HI> like those that passed between <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> in the early dayes of Christianity; but it requires a Convention of the Churches in <HI>Synods,</HI> by their <HI>Delegates</HI> and <HI>Messengers.</HI> He did not count Churches to be so <HI>Independent,</HI> as that they can always discharge their whole Duty, and yet not act in a conjunc|tion with Neighbour-Churches; nor would he be of any Church that will not acknowledge it self <HI>accountable</HI> to rightly composed <HI>Synods,</HI> which may have occasion to enquire into the

circumstances of it; he saw the main <HI>Interest</HI> and <HI>Business</HI> of Churches might quickly come to be utterly loft, if <HI>Synods</HI> were not often called for the Repairing of Inconveniences, and he was much in contriving for the regular and re|peated meeting of <HI>such</HI> Assemblies.</P>
<P>He wish'd for <HI>Councils</HI> to suppress all dam|nable Heresies or pernicious Opinions that might ever arise among us; for <HI>Councils</HI> to extinguish all dangerous Divisions, &amp; scandalous Contentions which might ever begin to flame in our Borders; for <HI>Councils</HI> to rectify all Male-Administrations in the midst of us, or to Recover any particular Churches out of any Disorders which they may be plung'd into: for <HI>Councils</HI> to enquire into the Love, the Peace, the Holiness maintained by the several Churches; in fine, for <HI>Councils</HI> to send forth fit <HI>Labourers</HI> into those parts of our Lords <HI>Harvest,</HI> which are without the Gospel of God. He be|held an Apostolical Precept and Pattern for such <HI>Councils;</HI> and when such <HI>Councils</HI> convened in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, by the consent of several Churches concerned in mutual Communion, have Declared, Explained, Recom|mended the mind of God from his word unto us, he reckoned a truth so delivered, challenged an Observation from the particular Churches, with a very great <HI>Authority.</HI></P>
<P>He therefore Printed an ingenious little Book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aring this Title, <HI>The Divine Management of

It is a remarkable Concession made by the Incomparable <HI>Jurieu</HI> who is not reckoned a <HI>Con|gregational</HI> man, in his <HI>Traite de L'Unite de L'Eglise,</HI> That the <HI>Apostolical Churches lived not in any Confederation for mutual Dependence. The grand Equipage of Metropolitans, of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nates, of Exarchs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, of Patriarks, was yet unknown; nor does it any more appear to us, that the Churches then had them Provincial, National, and Oecumenical Synods; e|very Church was its own Mistress, and independent on any other.</HI> But on the other side, our <HI>Eliot</HI> who was no <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> conceived <HI>Synods</HI> to be the Institutions of our Lord Jesus Christ, the <HI>Apostolical Churches themselves</HI> acknowledging a Stamp of <HI>Divine Right</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>Such as these were the sentiments of our <HI>Eliot;</HI> &amp; his deserved Reputation in the Church|es of <HI>New-England,</HI> is that which has caused me to foresee some Advantage and Benefit ari|sing unto the concerns of the Gospel, by so&punc; large a Recitation as I have now made thereof.</P>

<P>THe Titles of a <HI>Christian</HI> and of a <HI>Minister,</HI> have rendred our <HI>Eliot</HI> considerable; but there is one memorable Title more, by which he has been signalized unto us. An honoura|ble person did once in Print put the Name of an <HI>Evangelist</HI> upon him; whereupon in a Let|ter of his to that person afterwards Printed, his Expressions were, <Q>There is a <HI>Redundancy,</HI> where you put the Title of <HI>Evangelist</HI> upon me; I beseech you to suppress all such things; let us do and speak and carry all, things with Humility; it is the Lord who hath done what is done; and it is most becoming the Spirit of Jesus Christ to life up him, and lay our|selves low; I wish that word could be oblitera|ted.</Q> My Reader sees what a caution Mr. <HI>E|liot</HI> long since entred against our giving him the Title of an <HI>Evangelist;</HI> but his <HI>Death</HI> has now made it <HI>safe,</HI> as his <HI>Life</HI> had long made it <HI>just,</HI> for us to acknowledge him with such a Title.

Churches have hitherto been gathered he not all <HI>Office</HI> that should be continued in our days; but this I know, that our <HI>Eliot</HI> very notably did the <HI>Service</HI> and <HI>Business</HI> of such an Officer.</P>
<P>&para;The Natives of the Countrey now Pos|sessed by the <HI>New-Englanders,</HI> had been forlorn and wretched <HI>Heathen</HI> ever since their first herd|ing here; and tho we know not <HI>When</HI> or <HI>How</HI> those Indians first became Inhabitants of this mighty Continent, yet we may guess that proba|bly, the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vel decoy'd those miserable Salvages hither, in hopes that the Gospel of the Lord Jesus would never come here to destroy or dis|turb his <HI>Absolute E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> over them. But our <HI>Eliot</HI> was in such all terms with the Divel, as to alarm him with founding the <HI>Silver-Trum|pets</HI> of Heaven in his Territories, and make some Noble and Zealous Attempts towards out|ing him of his Ancient possessions here. Just before the first Arrival of the English in these parts, a prodigious Mortality had swept away vast Numbers of the poor Indians; and those Pagans who being told by a Shipwracked French|man which did in their hands, <HI>that God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> them, and introduce a more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and worthy people into their plate,</HI> blasphe|mously reph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">j, That <HI>God could not kill them;</HI> were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> with such a raging and wast|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, as left the very earth covered with their Carcases. Nevertheless, there were I think, Twenty several <HI>Nations</HI> (if I may call them so) of Indians upon that spot of ground,
<PB N="75" REF="000568_0081_0FA712B0E15E01E8">
which fell under the Influence of our <HI>Three Uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ta Colonies;</HI> and our <HI>Eliot</HI> was willing to rescue as many of them as he could, from that old usurping <HI>Land-Lord</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> who is <HI>by the wrath of God, the Prince of this world.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot find that any besides the Holy Spi|rit of God, first moved him to the blessed Work of <HI>Evangilizing</HI> these perishing Indians; 'twas that Holy Spirit which laid before his mind the <HI>Ideal</HI> of that which is now on the <HI>Seal</HI> of the Massachuset-Colony; <HI>A poor Indian having a Label going from his mouth, with a,</HI> COME OVER AND HELP US. It was the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ, which enkind|led in him a <HI>Fury,</HI> for the dark, dying damning souls of these Natives, whom <HI>the god of this world had blinded,</HI> through all the By past Ages. He was none of those that make, <HI>the Salvation of the Heather,</HI> an Article of their C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ead; but (setting aside the unrevealed and extraordinary Steps which the <HI>Holy One of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rail</HI> may take out of His <HI>usual Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hes</HI>) he thought seen to be <HI>lost</HI> if our <HI>Gospel</HI> be <HI>hidden</HI> from them; and he was of the same Opinion with one of the Ancients, who said, <HI>Some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to prove</HI> Plato <HI>a Christian, till they prove them selves little better than Heathen.</HI> It is indeed a principle in the Turkish <HI>Alcor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> That <HI>Let a man's Religion be what it will, he shall be saved, if be conse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ention sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> live up to the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">les of it:</HI> but our <HI>Eliot</HI> was no <HI>Mahometan.</HI> He could most heartily subscribe

to that passage in the Articles of the Ch. of <HI>Engl.</HI> <Q>They are to be held accursed, who presume to say, that every man shall be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be dili|gent to frame his life according to that Law, and Light of Nature; For Holy Scripture doth set out unto us, Only the Name of Je|sus Christs, whereby men must be Saved.</Q> And it astonished him to see many dissembling Subscribers of those Articles, while they have grown up to such a <HI>Phre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">sy,</HI> as to deny peremp|torily all <HI>Church-state,</HI> and all <HI>Salvation</HI> to all that are not under <HI>Diocesan Bishops,</HI> yet at the same time to grant that the <HI>Heathen</HI> might he saved without the Knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. No, it very powerfully moved his holy Bowels to hear the Thunderclapps of that Imprecation over the heads of our Naked Indians, <HI>Pour out thy Fury upon the Heathen that know thee not;</HI> and thought he, <HI>What shall I do to rescue those&punc; Heathen from that all-devouring Fury?</HI></P>
<P>But when this Charitable pitty had once begun to flame, there was a concurrence of ma|ny things to cast <HI>Oyl</HI> into it. All the good men in the Country were glad of his Engage|ment in such an undertaking; the <HI>Ministers</HI> es|pecially encouraged him, and those in the Neigh|bourhood kindly supply'd his place, and per|form'd his work, in part, for him at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> while he was <HI>Abroad</HI> Labouring among them

Lastly, when he had well begun this <HI>Evangelical Business,</HI> the good God, in an answer to his Prayers, mercifully stirred up a liberal Contribution among the god|ly people in <HI>England</HI> for the promoting of it; by means whereof, a considerable <HI>Estate</HI> and <HI>Income</HI> was at length entrusted in the hands of an Honourable <HI>Corporation,</HI> by whom 'tis to this Day very carefully employ'd in the Christi|an Service, which it was designed for.

they sacrificed a <HI>Dog</HI> to the Devil; after which no <HI>English</HI> Dog would bark at an Indian for divers months ensuing.

<P>It is above forty Years since that truly godly Man, Mr. <HI>John Elliot,</HI> Pastour of the Church at <HI>Rocksborough,</HI> (about a mile from <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New England)</HI> being warmed with a holy Zeal of Converting the <HI>Americans,</HI> set himself to

The pastor of that Church now is an <HI>Indian,</HI> his Name is <HI>Daniel.</HI> Besides this Church at <HI>Nature,</HI> among our Inhabitants in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">A ssa|eouses</HI> Colony there are four <HI>Indian</HI> Assemblies, (e) where the Name of the true God and Jesus Christ is solemnly called upon; these Assemblies have some <HI>American</HI> Preachers.

<HI>Indians.</HI> There is also another Island about se|ven Leagues long (called <HI>Marthas Utneyard</HI>) where are two American Churches planted, which are more famous than the rest, over one of which there presides an ancient <HI>Indian</HI> as Pastor, called <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">acooms: John Hiacoomes,</HI> Son of the said <HI>Indian</HI> Pastor, also Preacheth the Gos|pel to his Countrey-men.

In these Churches <HI>ruling Elders</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> are joyned to the Pastors: The Pastors were chosen by the people, and when they had fasted and prayed, Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> laid their Hands on them, so that they were solemnly Ordained. All the Congregations <HI>(h)</HI> of the Converted <HI>Indians</HI> (both the <HI>Cate|chumens</HI> and those in Church Order) every Lords-day meet together; the pastor or Preacher always begins with Prayer, and <HI>without a Form, because from the Heart;</HI> when the Ruler of the Assembly has ended Prayer, the whole Congre|gation of <HI>Indians</HI> Praise God with singing; some of them are excellent Singers: After the Psalm, he that Preaches reads a place of Scripture (one or more verses as he will) and expounds it, gathers Doctrines from it proves them by Scrip|tures and Reasons, and infers uses from them after the manner of the <HI>English,</HI> of whom have been taught; then another prayer to God in the Name of Christ concludes the whole Service.

every Lords-day. They observe no <HI>Holy days</HI> but the <HI>Lords-day,</HI> except upon some extraordinary occasion; and then they solemnly set apart whole days, either in giving Thanks or Fasting and Praying with great fervour of mind.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>English</HI> came into these Coasts these barbarous Nations were altogether igno|rant of the true God; hence it is that in their Prayers and Sermons they use <HI>English</HI> Words and Terms; he that calls upon the most Holy Name of God, says, <HI>Jehovah,</HI> or God, or <HI>Lord,</HI> and also they have learned and borrowed many other Theological Phrases from us</P>

<P>Q. 1. <HI>Who made you and all the world?</HI></P>
<P>Q. 2. <HI>Who do you look should save you from Sin and Hell?</HI></P>
<P>Q. 3. <HI>How many Commandments has the Lord given you to keep?</HI></P>
<P>It was his wisdom that he began with them upon such principles, as they themselves had already some Notions of; such as that of an <HI>Heaven</HI> for good, and <HI>Hell</HI> for bad people, when they <HI>Dy'd.</HI> It broke his gracious heart within him to see, what Floods of Tears fell from the Eyes of several among these Degenerate Salva|ges, at the first Addresses which he made unto them; yea, form the very worst of them all. He was very inquisitive to learn who were the <HI>Powawes,</HI> that is, the <HI>Sorcerers</HI> and <HI>Seducers,</HI> that maintained the Worship of the Devil in any of their Societies; and having in one of his first Journeys to them, found out one of those Wretches, he made the Indian come unto

him and said, <HI>Whether do you suppose</HI> God, <HI>or</HI> Chepian <HI>(i. e. the Devil) to be the Author of all good?</HI> The Conjurer answered, <HI>God.</HI> Upon this he added with a stern Countenance, <HI>Why do you pray to</HI> Chepian <HI>then?</HI> and the poor man was not able to stand or speak before him; but at last made promises of Reformation.</P>
<P>The Text which he first Preach'd upon, was that in Ezek. 37. 9,10. <HI>That by Prophesying to the Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> he Wind came and the dry bones lived;</HI> and it was an observation made by one, who then justly confessed, there was <HI>not much weight</HI> in it; That the word which the Indians use for <HI>Wind</HI> is <HI>Wauba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and an Indian of that Name was one of the first that here zealously promoted the Conversion of his Neighbours.

<P>The Little <HI>Kingdoms</HI> and <HI>Glories</HI> of the Great Men among the <HI>Indians,</HI> was a Powerful Obsta|cle to the success of Mr. <HI>Eliots</HI> Ministry; and it is observable, that several of those Nations which thus refused the Gospel, quickly after|wards were so <HI>Divel-driven</HI> as to begin an un|just and bloody <HI>War</HI> upon the English; which issued in their speedy and utter Extirpation from the Face of Gods Earth.

<P>Sometimes the more immediate Hand of God, by cutting off the principal Opposers of the Gospel among the Indians made way for Mr. <HI>Eliot'</HI>s Ministry.

<P>THe same spirit which acted Mr. <HI>Eliot,</HI> quickly inspired others elsewhere, to prosecute the work of rescuing the poor Indians out of their worse than <HI>Egyptian</HI>-Darkness, in which <HI>Evil Angels</HI> had been so long preying upon them.

<P>SO little was the Soul of our <HI>Eliot</HI> infected with any Envy, as that he long'd for nothing more than <HI>Fellow-Labourers,</HI> that might move and shine in the same <HI>Orb</HI> with himself; he made his cryes both to God and Man, for more <HI>Labourers</HI> to be <HI>thrust-forth,</HI> into the <HI>Indian|Harvest;</HI> and indeed it was an <HI>Harvest</HI> of so few secular Advantages and Encouragements, that it must be nothing less than a Divine <HI>Thrust;</HI> which could make any to <HI>Labour</HI> in it.

<P><HI>Noah</HI> Sacrificed, and so Worshipped. This was the manner of old time. But what <HI>Sa|crifices</HI> have we <HI>now</HI> to offer? I shall answer by that in Psal. 4. 5. <HI>Offer to God the Sacrifice of Righteousness, and put your Trust in the Lord.</HI> These are the true Spiritual <HI>Sacrifices</HI> which God requireth at <HI>our</HI> hands; the <HI>Sacrifices of Righteousness;</HI> that is, we must look to our hearts and ways, that-they be <HI>Righteous;</HI> and then we shall be acceptable to God when we Worship <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. But if we be unrighteous, unho|ly, ungodly, we shall not be accepted: our <HI>Sacri|fices</HI> will be stark naught.

<P>Once more, what <HI>Sacrifices</HI> must me offer?

<HEAD>(I) A Comparison between what the New-En|glanders have done for the Conversion of the Indians, and what has been done elsewhere by the Roman Catholicks.</HEAD>
<P>IT is to be confessed, That the <HI>Roman Catho|licks</HI> have a <HI>Clergy</HI> so very Numerous, and so little Encumbred, and are Masters of such pro|digious Ecclesiastical <HI>Revenues,</HI> as renders it ve|ry easy for them to exceed the <HI>Protestants</HI> In their Endeavours to Christianize the Pagan Sal|vages.

<HI>Paganism</HI> so forfeited all Right unto any of their <HI>Possessions,</HI> that the first pretended <HI>Christi|ans</HI> that could, right <HI>Violently</HI> and yet <HI>Honestly</HI> sieze upon them. Instead of this, the people of <HI>New England,</HI> knowing that some of the English were sufficiently coveteous and en|croaching, and that the Indians in streights are easily prevailed upon, to sell their lands, made a Law, <HI>That none should purchase, or so much at Receive any land of the Indians, without the Al|lowance of the Court.</HI> Yea, and some lands which were peculiarly convenient for the Indians, our people who were more careful of them than they were of themselves, made a Law <HI>That they should never be bought our of their bands.</HI> I suppose after this it would surprise mankind, if they should hear such wonderful Creatures as our late Secretary <HI>Randolph</HI> affirming, <HI>This bar|barous people were never civilly treated, by the late Government, who made it their business to encroach upon their Lands, and by degrees to have them out of all.</HI> But, how many other Laws we made in favour of the Indians 'tis not easy to reckon up. 'Twas one of our Laws, <Q>That for the further encouragement of the hopeful work among them, for the Civilizing and Christianizing of them, any Indian that should be brought unto Civility, and come to live orderly in any <HI>En|glish</HI> Plantation, should have such Allotments among the <HI>English,</HI> as the <HI>English</HI> had them|selves.

them, should so come on to civility, as to be capable of a Township, the General Court should grant them Lands for a Plantation as they do unto the <HI>English.</HI></Q> Altho' we had al|ready bought up their Claims unto our Lands. We likewise had our Laws, <HI>That if any of our Cattle did any damage to their Corn, we should make them ample satisfaction; and that we should give them all manner of Assistance, in Fencing of their Fields.</HI> And because the Indians are excessively given unto the vice of <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> which was a vice&punc; unknown to them, until the <HI>English</HI> brought <HI>Strong drink</HI> in their way, we have had a severe Law against all selling or giving any <HI>Intoxicating Liquors</HI> to them.
