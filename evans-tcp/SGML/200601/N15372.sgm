<HEAD>THE ADVENTURES, OF COL. DANIEL BOON.</HEAD>
<P>IT was on the fir&s;t of May 1769, that I re&s;igned my dome&s;tic happine&s;s, and left my family and peaceable habitation on the Yadkin River, in North-Carolina, to wander through the wilderne&s;s of America, in que&s;t of the country of Kentucke, in com|pany with John Finlay, John Stuart, Jo&s;eph Molden, James Monay, and William Cool.</P>
<P>On the 7th day of June, after travelling in a we&s;t|tern direction, we found our&s;elves an Red River, where John Finaly had formerly been trading with the Indi|ans, and from the top of an eminence, few with plea|&s;ure the beautiful level of Kentucke. For &s;ome time we had experienced the mo&s;t uncomfortable weather. We now encamped, made a &s;helter to defend us from the inclement &s;ea&s;on, and began to hunt and reconnoi|tre the country. We found abundance of wild bea&s;ts in this va&s;t fore&s;t. The buffaloes were more numer|ous than cattle on other &s;ettlements, browzing on the leaves of the cane, or cro&s;&s;ing the herbage on tho&s;e exten&s;ive plains, we &s;aw hundreds in a drove, and the numbers about the &s;alt &s;prings were amazing. In this fore&s;t the habitation of bea&s;ts of every American kind, we hunted with great &s;ucce&s;s until December.</P>
<P>On the 22d of December John Stuart and I had a plea&s;ant Ramble; but fortune changed the day at the clo&s;e of it. We had pa&s;&s;ed through a great fore&s;t, in which &s;tood myriads of trees, &s;ome gay with blo&s;|&s;oms, other rich with fruits. Nature was here a &s;eries of wonders and a fund of delight. Here &s;he di&s;played her ingenuity and indu&s;try in a variety of flowers and
<PB N="4" REF="019514_0003_0FABF5B9AEE34BC0">
fruits, beautifully coloured, elegantly &s;haped, and charmingly flavoured; and we were diverted with numberle&s;s animals pre&s;enting them&s;elves perpetually to our view. In the decline of the day, near Ken|tucke river, as we a&s;cended the brow of a &s;mall hill, a number of Indians ru&s;hed out of a thick cane brake, and made us pri&s;oners. The Indians plundered us, and kept us in confinement &s;even days. During this we di&s;covered no unea&s;ine&s;s or de&s;ire to e&s;cape, which made them le&s;s &s;u&s;picious: but in the dead of the night, as we lay by a large fire, in a thick cane brake, when &s;leep had locked up their &s;en&s;es, my &s;ituation not di&s;posing me to re&s;t, I gently awoke my compani|on. We &s;eized this favourable opportunity and de|parted, directing our cour&s;e towards our old camp, but found it plundered and our people di&s;per&s;ed or gone home.</P>
<P>About this time my brother, Squire Boon, with another adventurer, who came to explore the country &s;hortly after us, was wandering through the fore&s;t, and accidentally found our camp. Notwith&s;tanding our unfortunate circum&s;tances, and our dangerous &s;i|tuation &s;urrounded with ho&s;tile &s;avages, our meeting fortunately in the wilderne&s;s, gave us the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Soon after this my companion in captivity, John Stewart was killed by the &s;avages, and the man that came with my brother returned home by him&s;elf. We were then in a dangerous helple&s;s &s;ituation, expo&s;ed daily to perils and death, among &s;avages and wild bea&s;ts, not a white man in the country but our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Thus many hundred miles from our families in the howling wilderne&s;s, we did not continue in a &s;tate of indolence, but hunted every day, and prepared a little cottage to defend us from the winter &s;torms. We met with no di&s;turbance during the winter. On the 1&s;t of May 1770, my brother returned home by him&s;elf for a new recruit of hor&s;es and amunition, leaving me alone, without bread, &s;alt, or &s;ugar, or even a hor&s;e or a dog, I pa&s;&s;ed a few days uncomfortably. The idea
<PB N="5" REF="019514_0004_0FABF5BA6DDB4DB8">
of a beloved wife and family, and their anxiety on my account, would have di&s;po&s;ed me to melancholy, if I had further indulged the thought.</P>
<P>One day I undertook a tour through the country, when the diver&s;ity and beauties of nature I met with in this charming &s;ea&s;on, expelled every gloomy thought. Ju&s;t at the clo&s;e of the day, the gentle gales cea&s;ed; a profound calm en&s;ued; not a breath &s;hook the tremulous leaf. I had gained the &s;ummit of a com|manding ridge, and looking round with a&s;toni&s;hing delight, beheld the ample plains and beauteous tracts below. On one hand I &s;urveyed the famous Ohio rolling in &s;ilent dignity, and marking the we&s;t|ern bounds of Kentucke with inconceivable grandure. At a va&s;t di&s;tance I beheld the mountains lift their venerable brows and penetrate the clouds. All things were &s;till. I kindled a fire near a fountain of &s;weet water, and fea&s;ted on the loin of a buck, which a few hours before I had killed. The &s;hades of night &s;oon over&s;pread the hemi&s;phere, and the earth &s;eem to ga&s;p after the hovering moi&s;ture. My excur&s;ion had fa|tigued my body, and amu&s;ed my mind. I laid me down to &s;leep and awoke not until the &s;un had cha&s;ed away the night. I continued this tour, and in a few days explored a con&s;iderable part of the country, each day equally plea&s;ed as the fir&s;t; after which I re|turned to my old camp, which had not been di&s;turbed in my ab&s;ence I did not confine my lodgings to it, but often repo&s;ed in thick cane brakes to avoid the &s;avages, who I believe, often vi&s;ited my camp, but fortunately for me in my ab&s;ence. No populous city with all the varieties of commerce and &s;tately &s;tructures, could afford &s;uch plea&s;ure to my mind, as the beauties of nature I found in this country.</P>
<P>Until the 27th of July I &s;pent the time in an unin|terrupted &s;cene of &s;ylvan plea&s;ures, when my brother to my great felicity, met me according to appoint|ment, at our old camp. Soon after we left the place, and proceeded to Cumberland River, reconnoitring that part of the country, and giving names to the different rivers.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="019514_0005_0FABF5BB338AB7A8">In March 1771 I returned home to my family, be|ing determined to bring them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible at the ri&s;k of my life and fortune, to re&s;ide in Kentucke, which I e&s;teemed a &s;econd paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>On my return I found my family in happy circum|&s;tances. I &s;old my farm on the Yadkin, and what goods we could not carry with us; and</P>
<P>On the 25th of September 1773, we bade farewel to our friends and proceeded on our journey to Ken|tucke, in company with five more families, and forty men that joined us in Powell's Valley, which is one hundred and fifty miles from the now &s;ettled parts of Kentucke; but this promi&s;ing beginning was &s;oon overca&s;t with a cloud of adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>On the 10th of October the rear of our company was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ked by a number of Indians; who killed &s;ix, and wounded one man. Of the&s;e my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">de&s;t &s;on was one that fell in the action. Though we repul&s;ed the enemy, yet this unhappy affair &s;cattered our cattle, brought us into extreme difficulty, and &s;o di&s;couraged the whole company, that we retreated forty miles to the &s;ettlement on the Clench river. We had pa&s;&s;ed over two mountains Powell's and Walden's, and were approaching Cumberland mountain, when this ad|ver&s;e fortune overtook us. The&s;e mountains are in the wilderne&s;s, in pa&s;&s;ing from the old &s;ettlements in Virginia to Kentucke, are ranged in a &s;outhwe&s;t and northea&s;t direction, are of great length and breadth, and not far di&s;tant from each other. Over them na|ture has formed pa&s;&s;es le&s;s difficult than might be ex|pected from the view of &s;uch huge piles, The a&s;pect of the&s;e cliffs are &s;o wild and ho<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">d, that is impo&s;&s;ible to behold them without terror.</P>
<P>Until the 6th of June 1774, I remained with my family on the Clinch, when I and Michael S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">oner were &s;olicited by Governor Dunmore of Virginia, to conduct a number of &s;urveyors to the falls of the Ohio. This was a tour of 800 miles, and look us &s;ixty-two days.</P>
<P>On my return, Govornor Dunmore gave me the
<PB N="7" REF="019514_0006_0FABF5BBED9CAE78">
command of three gari&s;ons, during the campaign a|gain&s;t the Shawne&s;e.</P>
<P>In March 1775, at the &s;olicitation of a number of gentlemen of North-Carolina, I attended their treaty at Wataga, with the Cherokee Indians, to purcha&s;e the lands on the &s;outh &s;ide of Kentucke river. After this I undertook to mark out a road in the be&s;t pa&s;&s;age from the &s;ettlements through the wilderne&s;s to Ken|tucke.</P>
<P>Having collected a number of enterprizing men well armed, I &s;oon begun this work, we proceeded until we came within fifteen miles of where Boon&s;borough now &s;tands, where the Indians attacked us, and killed two and wounded two more.</P>
<P>This was the 2d of March 1775. Three days after they attacked us again, we had two killed and three wounded. After this we proceeded on to Kentucke river without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of April we began to erect the &s;ort of Boon&s;borough, at a &s;alt lick 60 yards from the river on the &s;outh &s;ide.</P>
<P>On the 4th they killed one of our men.</P>
<P>On the 14th of June having fini&s;hed the fort, I re|turned to my family on the Clinch. Soon after I removed my family to this fort; we arrived &s;afe; my wife and daughter being the fir&s;t white women that &s;tood on the banks of Kentucke river.</P>
<P>December the 24th. the Indians killed one man and wounded another, &s;eeming determined to per&s;e|cute us for erecting this fort.</P>
<P>July 14th 1776. Two of Colonel Calaway's daugh|ters, and one of mine, were taken pri&s;oners near the fort. I immediately pur&s;ued the Indians, with only eight men.</P>
<P>On the 16th I overtook them, killed two of them&punc; and recovered the girls.</P>
<P>The Indians had divided them&s;elves into &s;everal parties and attacked on the &s;ame day all our &s;ettle|ments and forts, doing a great deal of mi&s;chief. The hu&s;bandmen were &s;hot down in the field, and mo&s;t of
<PB N="8" REF="019514_0007_0FABF5BCDBD88658">
the cattle were de&s;troyed. They continued their ho&s;tilities until</P>
<P>The 15th of April 1777, when a party of 100 of them attacked Boon&s;borough, and killed one man, and wounded four.</P>
<P>July 4th they attacked it again with 250 men, and killed us one, and wounded two. They remained 48 hours, during which we killed &s;even of them. All the &s;ettlements were attacked at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>July 19th. Colonel Logan's fort was be&s;ieged by 200 Indians; they did much mi&s;chief; there were only fifteen men in the fort; they killed two and wounded one of them. Indians lo&s;s unknown.</P>
<P>July 25. Twenty five men came from Carolina. About</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 20th, Colonel Bowman arrived with 100 men from Virginia. Now we began to &s;trengthen and had &s;kirmi&s;hes with the Indians almo&s;t every day.</P>
<P>The &s;avages now learned the &s;uperiority of the LONG KNIFE, as they call the Virginians; being out-generaled in almo&s;t every battle. Our affairs be|gan to wear a new a&s;pect; the enemy did not now venture open war, but practi&s;ed &s;ecret mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>January 1, 1778. I went with thirty men to the Blue Licks on Licking River, to make &s;alt for the different garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>February 7th. Hunting by my&s;elf to procure meat for the company, I met a party of 102 Indians, and two Frenchmen marching again&s;t Boon&s;borough. They pur&s;ued and took me; and the next day I capi|tulated for my men, knowing they could not e&s;cape. They were 27 in number, three having gone home with &s;alt. The Indians according to the capitulation u&s;ed us generou&s;ly. They carried us to Old Cheli|cothe, the principal Indian town on Little Miami.</P>
<P>On the 18th of February we arrived there, after an uncomfortable journey in very &s;evere weather.</P>
<P>On the 10th of March I and ten of my men were conducted to Detroit.</P>
<P>On the 30th we arrived there, and were treated by
<PB N="9" REF="019514_0008_0FABF5BD6C0FF7E0">
Governor Hamilton, the Briti&s;h commander at the po&s;t, with great humanity.</P>
<P>The Indians had &s;uch an affection for me, that they refu&s;ed 100l. &s;terling offered them by the Gover|nor, if they would leave me with the others, on pur|po&s;e that he might &s;end me home on parole. Several Engli&s;h gentlemen there, &s;en&s;ible of my adver&s;e for|tune, and touched with &s;ympathy, generou&s;ly offered to &s;upply my wants, which I declined with many thanks, adding that I never expected it would be it my power to recompence &s;uch unmerited generosity. The Indians left my men in captivity with the Briti&s;h at Detroit.</P>
<P>On the 10th of April they brought me towards Old Chelicothe, where we arrived on the twenty-fifth day of the &s;ame month. This was a long and very fatiguing march, through an exceeding fertile country, remarkable for fine &s;prings and &s;treams of water. At Chelicothe I &s;pent my time as comfortably as I could expect; was adopted according to their cu&s;tom, into a family, where I became a &s;on, and had a great &s;hare in the affection of my new parents, brothers, &s;i&s;ters, and friends. I was exceedingly familiar and ea&s;y with them, always appearing as chearful and &s;atisfied as po&s;&s;ible and they put great confidence in me. I often went a hunting with them, and fre|quently gained their applau&s;e for my activity at our &s;hooting matches.</P>
<P>I was careful not to exceed many of them in &s;hoot|ing; for no people are more envious than they in this &s;port. I could ob&s;erve in their countenances and ge&s;tures the greate&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of joy when they ex|ceeded me, and, when the rever&s;e happened of envy. The Shawne&s;e king took great notice of me, and treated me with profound re&s;pect, and entire friend|&s;hip, often entru&s;ting me to hunt at my liberty. I frequently returned with the &s;poils of the woods, and as often pre&s;ented &s;ome of what I had taken to him, expre&s;&s;ive of my duty to my &s;overeign. My food and lodging was, in common with them, not &s;o good in|deed
<PB N="10" REF="019514_0009_0FABF5C6AE44C5B8">
as I could de&s;ire, but nece&s;&s;ity made every thing acceptable.</P>
<P>I now began to meditate an e&s;cape, but carefully avoided giving &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Until the fir&s;t day of June, I continued at old Che|licothe, and was then taken to the &s;alt &s;prings on Sciotha, and kept there ten days making &s;alt. Dur|ing this time I hunted with them, and found the land, for a great extent about this river, to exceed the &s;oil of Kentucke if po&s;&s;ible, and remarkably well watered.</P>
<P>On my return to Chelicothe 450 of the choice&s;t Indian warriors were ready to march again&s;t Boon&s;bo|rough, painted and armed in a fearful manner. This alarmed me and I determined to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>On the 16th of June before &s;unri&s;e, I went off &s;e|cretly, and reached Boon&s;borough on the 20th, a jour|ney of 160 miles during which I had only one meal, I found our fortre&s;s in a bad &s;tate, but we immediately repaired our flanks, gates, po&s;terns, and formed dou|ble ba&s;tions, which we completed in ten days. One of my fellow pri&s;oners e&s;caping after me, brought ad|vice that on account of my flight, the Indians had put off their expedition for three weeks.</P>
<P>About Augu&s;t 1&s;t I &s;et out with 19 men to &s;urpri&s;e Point Creek Town on Sciotha. Within four miles we fell in with 40 Indians going again&s;t Boon&s;borough. We fought and the enemy gave way, we &s;uffered no lo&s;s. The enemy had one killed and two wounded. We took three hor&s;es and all their baggage. The Indians having evacuated their town and gone altoge|ther again&s;t Boon&s;borough we returned pa&s;&s;ed them on the &s;ixth day, and on the &s;eventh arrived &s;afe at Boon&s;borough.</P>
<P>On the 8th the Indian army 444 in number, com|manded by Capt. Duque&s;ne and eleven other French|men and their own chiefs, came and &s;ummoned the fort. I reque&s;ted two days con&s;ideration which was granted. During this we brought in through the po&s;terns all the hor&s;es and other cattle we could col|lect.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="019514_0010_0FABF5CC66BB5FF0">On the 9th in the evening, I informed their com|mander, that we were determined to defend the fort while a man was living. They then propo&s;ed a trea|ty, and &s;aid if we &s;ent out nine men to ratify it, they would withdraw. The treaty was held within &s;ixty yards of the fort, as we &s;u&s;pected the &s;avages. The articles were agreed to and &s;igned; when the Indi|ans told us, it was their cu&s;tom for two Indians to &s;hake hands with every white man in the treaty as an evidence of friend&s;hip. We agreed to this al&s;o. They immediately grappled us to take us pri&s;oners, but we cleared our&s;elves of them, though &s;urrounded by hundreds and gained the fort &s;afe, except one that was wounded by a heavy fire from their army. On this they began to undermine the fort, beginning at the water mark of Kentucke river, which is 60 yards from the fort. We di&s;covered this by the water being made muddy by the clay, and countermined them by cutting a trench acro&s;s their &s;ubterranean pa&s;&s;age. The enemy di&s;covering this by the clay we threw out of the fort, de&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>On the 20th of Augu&s;t they rai&s;ed the &s;iege.</P>
<P>During this dreadful &s;iege, we had two men killed, and four wounded. We lo&s;t a number of cattle. We killed 37 of the enemy, and wounded a great number. We picked up 125 lb. of their bullets, be&s;ides what &s;tuck in the logs of the fort.</P>
<P>Soon after this I went into the &s;ettlement, and no|thing worthy of notice pa&s;&s;ed for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>In July 1779, during my ab&s;ence, Col. Bowman with 160 men, went again&s;t the Shawne&s;e of Old Chi|licothe. He arrived undi&s;covered, a battle en&s;ued, which la&s;ted until ten in the morning, when Colonel Bowman retreated 30 miles. The Indians collected all their &s;trength and pur&s;ued him, when another en|gagement en&s;ued for two hours, not to Col. Bowman's advantage. Col. Harrod propo&s;ed to mount a num|ber of hor&s;e and brake the enemy's line; who at this time fought with remarkable fury. This de&s;perate mea&s;ure had a happy effect, and the &s;avages fled on
<PB N="12" REF="019514_0011_0FABF5CC7138E038">
all &s;ides. In the&s;e two battles we had nine men kill|ed and one wounded. Enemy's lo&s;s uncertain, only two &s;calps being taken.</P>
<P>June 22d 1780, 600 Indians and Canadians under Col. Bird, attacked Riddles and Martain's &s;tation, and the Forks of Licking River with &s;ix pieces of ar|tillery; they took all the inhabitants captives, and killed one man and two women, loaded the others with the heavy baggage, and &s;uch as failed in the journey were tomahawked.</P>
<P>The ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;avages cau&s;ed Ge|neral Clark, the commandant at the falls of Ohio, to march with his regiment and the armed force of the country again&s;t Peccaway, the principal town of the Shawane&s;e, on a brach of the Great Niami, which he fini&s;hed with great &s;ucce&s;s took &s;eventeen &s;calps, and burned the town to a&s;hes, with the lo&s;s of &s;eventeen men.</P>
<P>About this time I returned to Kentucke with my family; for during my captivity, my wife, thinking me killed by the Indians, had tran&s;ported my family and goods on hor&s;es through the wilderne&s;s, amid&s;t many dangers to her father;s hou&s;e in North-Carolina. The Hi&s;tory of my difficulties in going and returning is too long to be in&s;erted here.</P>
<P>On the 6th of October 1780, &s;oon after my &s;ettling again at Boon&s;borough, I went with my brother to the Blue Licks and on our return he was &s;hot by a party of Indians, they followed me by &s;cent of a dog, which I &s;hot and e&s;caped.</P>
<P>The &s;everity of the winter cau&s;ed great di&s;tre&s;s in Kentucke the enemy during the &s;ummer having de&s;troy|ed mo&s;t of the corn. The inhabitants lived chiefly on Buffaloe's fle&s;h.</P>
<P>In &s;pring 1782, the Indians harra&s;&s;ed us.</P>
<P>In May they killed one at A&s;hton's &s;tation, and took a Negro. Capt. A&s;hton pur&s;ued them with 25 men, and in an engagement which la&s;ted two hours, his party were obliged to retreat, having 8 killed, 4 mortally wounded; their brave commander fell in this action.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="019514_0012_0FABF5CDCFD74470">Augu&s;t 10th, two boys were carried off from Ma|jor Hoy's &s;tation, Captain Holder pur&s;ued with 17 men, they were al&s;o defeated, and lo&s;t 4 and 1 wounded.</P>
<P>Our affairs became more and more alarming. The &s;avages infe&s;ted the country, killing men at every op|portunity.</P>
<P>In a field near Lexington, an Indian &s;hot a man, and running to &s;calp him, was him&s;elf &s;hot from the fort and fell dead upon his enemy.</P>
<P>All the indian nations were now united again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 15th&punc; five hundred Indians and Canadians came again&s;t Briat's &s;tation 5 miles from Lexington, they a&s;&s;aulted the fort, killed all the cattle round it; but being repul&s;ed they retired the third day, having about 30 killed their wounded uncertain. The garri|&s;on had 4 killed and 3 wounded.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 18th, Col. Todd, Col. Trigg, Major Har|land, and my&s;elf, &s;peedily collected one hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix men well armed and pur&s;ued the &s;avages. They had marchad beyond the Blue Licks to a re|markable bend of the main fork of Licking River, about 43 miles from Lexington, where we overtook them on the 19th.</P>
<P>The &s;avages ob&s;erving us, gave way, and we, igno|rant of their numbers, pa&s;&s;ed the river. When they &s;aw our proceedings having greatly the advantage in &s;ituation, they formed their line of battle from one end of the Licking to the other, aboat a mile from the Blue Licks. The battle was exceeding fierce for about 15 minutes, when we being overpowered by numbers, were obliged to retreat, with the lo&s;s of 67 men 7 of whom were taken pri&s;oners. The brave and much lamented Colonels Todd and Trigg, Major Harland and my &s;econd &s;on, were among the dead. We were afterwards told that the Indians, on numbering their dead, finding they had four more killed than we, four of our people they had taken, were given up to their young warriors, to be put to death after their barbar|ous manner.</P>
<P>On our retreat we were met by Col. Logan, who
<PB N="14" REF="019514_0013_0FABF5CDF83C9758">
was ha&s;tening to join us, with a number of well arm|ed men. This powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance we wanted on the day of battle. The enemy &s;aid one more fire from us would have made them give way.</P>
<P>I cannot reflect upon this dreadful &s;cene, but &s;orrow fills my heart. A zeal for the defence of their country led the&s;e heroes to the &s;cene of action, though with a few men to attack a powerful army of experienced warriors. When we gave way, they pur&s;ued us with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s, and in every quarter &s;pread de|&s;truction. The river was difficult to cro&s;s, and many were killed in the flight, &s;ome ju&s;t entering the river, &s;ome in the water, others after cro&s;&s;ing in a&s;cending the cliffs. Some e&s;caped on hor&s;eback, a few on foot; and being di&s;per&s;ed every where in a few hours, brought the melancholy news of this unfortunate bat|tle to Lexington. Many widows were now made. The reader may gue&s;s what &s;orrow filled the hearts of the inhabitants, exceeding any thing I am able to de&s;|cribe. Being reinforced, we returned to bury the dead, and found their bodies &s;trewed every where, cut and mangled in a dreadful manner. This mourn|ful &s;cene exhibited a horror almo&s;t unparalled; &s;ome torn and eaten by wild bea&s;ts; tho&s;e in the river eaten by fi&s;hes; all in &s;uch a putrid condition that no one could be di&s;tingui&s;hed from another.</P>
<P>When General Clark at the Falls of Ohio, heard of our di&s;a&s;ter, he ordered an expedition to pur&s;ue the &s;avages, we overtook them within two miles of their towns, and we &s;hould have obtained a great victory, had not &s;ome of them met us when about two hun|dred poles from their camp. The &s;avages fled in the utmo&s;t di&s;order, and evacuated all their towns. We burned to a&s;hes Old Chelicothe, Peccaway, New Che|licothe, Wills Town, and Chelicothe; entirely de|&s;troyed their corn and other fruits; and &s;pread de&s;o|lation through their country. We took 7 pri&s;oners, and 5 &s;calps, and lo&s;t only 4 men, 2 of whom were accidentally killed by our&s;elves.</P>
<P>This campaign damped the enemy, yet they made &s;ecret incur&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="019514_0014_0FABF5CEB8FE31D8">In October a party attacked Crap Orchard, and one of them being a good way before the others, boldly entered a hou&s;e, in which were only a woman and her children and a negro man. The &s;avage u&s;ed no vio|lence, but attempted to carry off the negro, who hap|pily proved too &s;trong for him, and threw him on the ground, and in the &s;truggle the woman cut of his head with an axe&mdash;whil&s;t her little daughter &s;hut the door. The &s;avages in&s;tantly came up and applied their tomahawks to the door, when the mo|ther putting an old ru&s;ty gun barrel through a crevice, the &s;avages immediately went off.</P>
<P>From that time until the happy return of peace between the United States and Great Britain, the Indians did us no mi&s;chief.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>NARRATIVE</HI> of the Capti|vity and E&s;cape of Mrs. <HI>Francis Scott,</HI> an Inhabitant of Wa&s;hington County, Virginia.</HEAD>
<P>ON Wedne&s;day the 29th day of June, 1785, late in the evening, a large company of armed men pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e, on their way to Kentucky; &s;ome part of whom en|camped within two miles. Mr. Scott living on a frontier part, generally made the family watchful; but on this calami|tous day, after &s;o large a body of men had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;hortly after night, he lay down in his bed, and imprudently left one of the doors of his hou&s;e open; the children were al&s;o in bed, and a&s;leep. Mrs. Scott was nearly undre&s;&s;ed, when, to her unutterable a&s;toni&s;hment and hor|rour, &s;he &s;aw ru&s;hing in through the door that was le&s;t open, painted &s;avages with pre&s;ented arms, rai&s;ing a hideous &s;hriek &mdash;Mr. Scott being awake, in&s;tantly jumped out of his bed, but was imme|diately fired at: he forced his way thro' the middle of the enemy and got out of the door, but fell a few paces from thence. An Indian &s;eized Mrs. Scott,
<PB N="17" REF="019514_0016_0FABF5D02FDA0000">
and ordered her to a particular &s;pot and not to move; others &s;tabbed and cut the throats of the three younge&s;t chil|dren in their bed, and afterwards lifted them up and da&s;hed them down on the floor, near the mother; the olde&s;t, a beautiful girl of eight years old, awoke and e&s;caped out of the bed, and ran to her parent, and, with the mo&s;t plaintive accents, cried, "O mama! mama! &s;ave me"&mdash;the mother, in the deepe&s;t angui&s;h of &s;pirit, and with a flood of tears, in|treated the &s;avages to &s;pare her child; but, with a brutal fiercene&s;s, they to|mahawked and &s;tabbed her in the mo|ther's arms. Adjacent to Mr. Scott's dwelling hou&s;e, another family lived, of the name of Ball. The Indians al&s;o at|tacked them at the &s;ame in&s;tant they did Mr. Scott's; but the door being &s;hut, the enemy fired into the hou&s;e through an opening between two logs, and kill|ed a young lad, and then e&s;&s;ayed to force the door open; but a &s;urviving brother fired through the door, and the enemy de&s;i&s;ted, and went off; the re|maining part of the family ran out of the hou&s;e and e&s;caped. In Mr. Scott's hou&s;e were four good rifles well loaded,
<PB N="18" REF="019514_0017_0FABF5D1185CB1C0">
and a good deal of cloathing and furni|ture, part of which belonged to people that had left it on their way to Ken|tucky. The Indians loaded them&s;elves with the plunder, being 13 in number, then &s;peedily made off, and continued travelling all night; next morning their chief allotted to each man his &s;hare, and detached nine of the party to &s;teal hor&s;es from the inhabitants on Clinch.&mdash;</P>
<P>The eleventh day after Mrs. Scott's captivity, the four Indians that had her in charge &s;topped at a place of rendez|vous, and to hunt, being now in great want of provi&s;ions. Three went out, and the chief, being an old man, was left to take care of the pri&s;oner, who, by this time, expre&s;&s;ed a willingne&s;s to proceed to the Indian towns, which &s;eemed to have the de&s;ired effect of le&s;&s;ening her keeper's vigilance. In the day time, as the old man was grain|ing a deer-&s;kin, the captive, pondering on her &s;ituation, and anxiou&s;ly looking for an opportunity to make her e&s;cape, took the re&s;olution, and going to the Indian carele&s;sly, a&s;ked liberty to go a &s;mall di&s;tance to a &s;tream of water, to wa&s;h the blood off her apron, that had
<PB N="19" REF="019514_0018_0FABF5D1B83484F0">
remained be&s;meared &s;ince the fatal night of the murder of her little daughter. He &s;aid to her in the Engli&s;h tongue, "go along;" &s;he then pa&s;&s;ed by him, his face being in a contrary direction from that &s;he was going, and he very bu&s;y. She, after getting to the water, proceeded on without delay, made to a high barren mountain, and travelled until late in the evening, when &s;he came down to the valley, in &s;earch of the track &s;he had been taken along; hoping thereby to find the way back, without the ri&s;k of being lo&s;t, and per|i&s;hing with hunger in uninhabited parts. On coming acro&s;s the valley to the river &s;ide, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ea&s;terly branch of Kentucky river, &s;he ob&s;erved in the &s;and, tracks of two men, that had gone up the river, and had ju&s;t returned.&mdash; She concluded the&s;e to have been her pur&s;uers, which excited emotions of gratitude and thankfulne&s;s to divine providence for &s;o timeous a deliverance. Being without any provi&s;ions, having no kind of weapon or tool to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in getting any, and being almo&s;t de&s;ti|tute of cloathing, al&s;o knowing that a va&s;t tract of rugged high mountains in|tervened,
<PB N="20" REF="019514_0019_0FABF5D26E3B6F18">
between where &s;he was and the inhabitants ea&s;twardly, and that di&s;|tance of the Kentucky &s;ettlements un|known, and &s;he almo&s;t as ignorant as a child of the method of &s;teering through the woods, excited painful &s;en&s;ations.&mdash; But certain death, either by hunger or wild bea&s;ts, &s;eemed preferable rather than to be in the power of beings who had excited in her mind &s;uch horrour. She addre&s;&s;ed heaven for protection, and taking courage, proceeded onward. After travelling three days, &s;he had nearly met with the Indians, as &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed, that had been &s;ent to Clinch to &s;teal hor&s;es, but providentially hearing their approach, concealed her&s;elf among the cane, until the enemy had pa&s;&s;ed. This giving a fre&s;h alarm, and her mind being filled with con&s;ternation, &s;he got lo&s;t, proceeding backwards and for|wards for &s;everal days: at length &s;he came to a river, that &s;eemed to come from the ea&s;t; concluding it was Sandy river, &s;he accordingly re&s;olved to trace it to its &s;ource, which is adjacent to the Clinch &s;ettlement. After proceeding up the &s;ame &s;everal days, &s;he came to where the river runs through the great
<PB N="21" REF="019514_0020_0FABF5D333EBD6F0">
Laural mountain, where is a prodigious water-fall, and numerous high craggy clifts along the water edge; that way &s;eemed impa&s;&s;able, the mountain &s;teep and difficult: However, our mournful traveller concluded that the latter way was the be&s;t. She therefore a&s;cended for &s;ome time, but coming to a range of inacce&s;&s;ible rocks, &s;he turned her cour&s;e towards the foot of the mountain and the river &s;ide; after getting into a deep gulley, and pa&s;&s;ing over &s;everal high &s;teep rocks, &s;he reached the river &s;ide, where, to her inexpre&s;&s;ible affliction, &s;he found that a perpendicular rocks, or rather one that hung over, of 15 or 20 feet high, formed the bank. Here a &s;olemn pau&s;e took place; &s;he e&s;&s;ayed to return, but the height of the &s;teep rocks &s;he had de&s;cended over, prevent|ed her. She then returned to the edge of the precipice, and viewed the bottom of it, as the certain &s;pot to end all her troubles, or remain on the top to pine away with hunger, or be devoured by wild bea&s;ts. After &s;erious meditation, and devout exerci&s;es, &s;he determined on leaping from the height, and according|ly jumped off. Although the place &s;he
<PB N="22" REF="019514_0021_0FABF5D44D3F7EA8">
had to alight on, was covered with uneven rocks, not a bone was broken; but, being exceedingly &s;tunned with the fall, &s;he remained unable to proceed for &s;ome &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>The dry &s;ea&s;on cau&s;ed the river to be &s;hallow&mdash;&s;he travelled in it, where &s;he could, by its edge, until &s;he got through the mountain, which &s;he concluded was &s;everal miles. After this, as &s;he was travelling along the bank of the river, a venomous &s;nake bit her on the ankle: &s;he had &s;trength to kill it, and knowing its kind, concluded that death mu&s;t &s;oon overtake her. By this time Mrs. Scott was reduced to a mere &s;keleton, with fa|tigue, hunger and grief; probably this &s;tate of her body was the means of pre|&s;erving her from the effects of the poi&s;on; be that as it may, &s;o it was, that very little pain &s;ucceeded the bite, and what little &s;welling there was, fell into her feet. Our wanderer now left the river, and, after proceeding a good di&s;tance, &s;he came to where the valley parted into two, each leading a different cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Here a painful &s;u&s;pence again took place; a &s;orlorn creature, almo&s;t ex|hau&s;ted, and certain, if &s;he was far led
<PB N="23" REF="019514_0022_0FABF5EDD7401278">
out of the way, &s;he would never &s;ee a human creature. During this &s;olilo|quy, a beautiful bird pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by her, fluttering along the ground, and went out of &s;ight up one of the vallies. This drew her attention, and whil&s;t con|&s;idering what it might mean, another bird, of the &s;ame appearance, in like manner fluttered pa&s;t her, and took the &s;ame valley the other had done. This determined her choice of the way; and, in two days, which was on the 11th day of Augu&s;t, &s;he reached that &s;ettlement on Clinch, called New-Garden: whereas (&s;he has &s;ince been informed by woods|men) had &s;he taken the other valley, it would have led her back towards the Ohio. Mrs. Scott relates, that the In|dians told her, that the party was com|po&s;ed of four different nations, two of whom &s;he thinks they named Delawares and Mingoes.</P>
<P>She further relates, that, during her wandering, from the tenth of July to the eleventh of Augu&s;t, &s;he had no other &s;ub&s;i&s;tance but chewing and &s;wal|lowing the juice of young cane &s;talks, Sa&s;&s;afras leaves, and &s;ome other plants &s;he did not know the name of, that on
<PB N="24" REF="019514_0023_0FABF5EF21058590">
her journey, &s;he &s;aw Buffaloes, Elks, Deers, and frequently Bears and Wolves; not one of which offered to do her the lea&s;t harm. One day a bear came near her, with a young &s;awn in his mouth, and, on di&s;covering her, he dropped his prey and ran off. Hunger prompted her to go and take the fle&s;h and eat it; but on reflection, &s;he de&s;i&s;ted, thinking the bear might return and devour her; be&s;ides &s;he had an aver&s;ion to ta&s;te raw fle&s;h.&mdash;Mrs. Scott continues in a low &s;tate of health, and remains incon&s;olable for the lo&s;s of her family, particularly bewailing the cruel death of her little daughter.</P>
