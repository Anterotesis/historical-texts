<P>THE knowledge of our good and &s;afe E&s;tate, deriving from an intere&s;t in the Everla&s;ting Love of God, is a thing which every one who hath right thoughts of the Eternity he is going to, will be very &s;ollicitous about. There is, be&s;ides the <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> of the Spirit of God to this in us, which is nece&s;&s;ary for our confirmation in the belief of it, the <HI>witne&s;s</HI> of our own &s;pirit re|qui&s;ite, for our ordinary <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> about it, which mu&s;t be given to tho&s;e things in us which are evidencial of it. The&s;e <HI>Evidences</HI> are built upon the di&s;covery of &s;uch fruits or effects of the love of God wrought in us, as are proper and di&s;tingui&s;hing, and the&s;e are mainly the Graces of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI>; and the&s;e are

priority of Gods love to us, as that from which we come to love him, which can be inferred from no other but the <HI>Efficient.</HI> The word is an <HI>Adjective,</HI> and not an <HI>Adverb</HI>; and that al&s;o puts force into the argument; he was the <HI>first</HI> in this love, and thence it was that our love followed after. Hence,</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE. Our Loving of God is the ginuine effect of his fir&s;t Loving of us. If we love him in time, is it becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us from Eternity.</HEAD>
<P>I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on this <HI>Doctrine</HI> at large, but re&s;train the following Di&s;cour&s;e to the re&s;oluti|on of the following <HI>Ca&s;e, viz.</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>In what re&s;pect Gods love to us is lea|ding to, and influential of our loving of him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That we may take up the right meaning of the Ca&s;e, in order to the better re&s;olution of it: There are the&s;e two remarks to be made.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That by Gods love to us, we are to understand his Eternal purpo&s;e of good will, by which he appoin|ted us to Salvation by Chri&s;t. Love</HI> is improperly attributed to God&punc; in whom there are no <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> or <HI>Affections,</HI> properly &s;o called, ina&s;much as
<PB N="7" REF="000961_0004_0FADE571529F2E70">
they argue imperfection, and compo&s;ition in the &s;ubject of them, which is incompatible with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute fir&s;t Being. But becau&s;e the&s;e are in men the In&s;truments of the <HI>Will,</HI> by the Mi|ni&s;try whereof it performs its <HI>Imperate Actions,</HI> or they are the various po&s;tures of it with re|&s;pect to its <HI>Object,</HI> according to the re&s;entment that it hath of it; hereupon when we &s;ee &s;uch things done in Gods Works of Efficiency, as are wont to be managed by &s;uch an <HI>Affection</HI>; we, after our manner of conception, a&s;cribe it to that <HI>Affection</HI>; becau&s;e we cannot otherwi&s;e ex|pre&s;s it. Now <HI>love is an Affection in us, which beareth good will to the Object of it&punc; and expre&s;&s;eth it &s;elf in acts of kindne&s;s to it.</HI> As therefore it is an Humane Affection, it is rooted in the heart or will, and is on all opportunities di&s;covering it &s;elf in the carriage; and from this conception of it, when God manife&s;teth his benignity to the Creature, we conceive him, in his &s;o doing, to act as a cau&s;e by Coun&s;el, and &s;o a&s;cribe it to his <HI>Benevolence,</HI> and call it his <HI>love.</HI> And from this con&s;ideration, there is a divers love that is a&s;&s;ign|ed to him, according to the different effects of his good will, di&s;cerned in the fruits of his <HI>Be|neficence</HI> to the Subject of it. There is a <HI>com|mon love</HI> attributed to him, wherein the good and the bad do promi&s;cuou&s;ly partake; and it appears in that <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> of his which he confers upon them, wherein he gives them large ta&s;ts of
<PB N="8" REF="000961_0005_0FADE57454FA21E8">
his bounty; and to this love we are pointed in, P&s;al. 145.9. <HI>The Lord is good to all and his tender mercies are over all his works.</HI> An<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Acts</HI> 14.17. <HI>He left not him&s;elf without witne&s;s in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, filling our hearts with food and gladne&s;s.</HI> And there is an <HI>E&s;pecial</HI> love of his that we are told of, which he bears only to &s;ome, and in compari&s;on with which others are &s;aid to be hated, according to Rom. 9.13 <HI>Jacob have I loved, and E&s;au have I hated</HI>; and it appears in tho&s;e peculiar favours which he hath laid in for, and be&s;tows upon them; of which we have &s;uch ob&s;ervations, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. <HI>God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,</HI> &amp;c. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4 9. <HI>In this was the love of God manife&s;ted towards us, becau&s;e God &s;ent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him</HI>; and this is the love that we are now con&s;ider|ing of, and is intended in our <HI>Text</HI>: which, if we run up to the top of it, is nothing el&s;e but <HI>that good will of his, by which he purpo&s;ed to be|stow all &s;aving good upon us.</HI> There is a <HI>natural</HI> love which we a&s;cribe to God, by which he loveth him&s;elf eternally, being his own la&s;t end: and with this love every Sacred <HI>Per&s;on</HI> in the undivided <HI>Trinity</HI> love each other; and there is a <HI>voluntary</HI> love which we conceive in him, which mu&s;t needs flow from his good plea&s;ure; for we are told, Rom. 9.18. <HI>He hath mercy on
<PB N="9" REF="000961_0006_0FADE5752E095EB0">
whom he will have mercy.</HI> And &s;uch mu&s;t be all the love which he bears to the Creature, &s;ince its being, and all that he doth to it or for it derive from his holy plea&s;ure, <HI>Who doth all things according to the Coun&s;el of his will, Eph.</HI> 1.11. And it was this love that procured our Salvation, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.20. <HI>Who loved me, and gave him&s;elf for me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That by our loving of God we mu&s;t understand, that Cordial re&s;pect which we have for him, where by we have cho&s;en him for our portion, and are en|tirely devoted to his fear. Love in us, is an Af|fection leading us in pur&s;uit after Union to the object of it, in order to our having intimate Communion with it</HI>: for love is a <HI>Clo&s;ing</HI> Affection, and carrieth us forth after that which we love. That which attracts our love to it, is the <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> which we apprehend to be in the object of it, which renders it a thing lovely; the di&s;covery of which goodne&s;s made to the <HI>Under&s;tanding,</HI> moves on the <HI>Judgment,</HI> and by that on the <HI>Heart,</HI> and draws it out after it. Now the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of this love is in <HI>a &s;uitable re&s;pect</HI> that we &s;hew to the object of it, and is accordingly diver&s;ifyed, as there is a different reference or re|lation that we bear to it: the love therefore of Parents to their Children, and of Children to their Parents doth not &s;hew it &s;elf after the &s;ame manner. There are therefore the&s;e two things wherein our real love to God appears,
<PB N="10" REF="000961_0007_0FADE575E1B24438">
<HI>Viz.</HI> In our renouncing of all other things for him, chu&s;ing him alone for our portion, and accordingly depending upon him for all; when we can &s;ay as the Church, Lam. 3.24. <HI>The Lord is my portion &s;aith my Soul, therefore I will hope in him</HI>: And as the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 62.5. <HI>My Soul wait thou only upon God, for my expectation is from him</HI> And in our &s;ubmitting our &s;elves with greate&s;t willingne&s;s and delight to his Service: Chri&s;t therefore directs to this as the Evidence of our love <HI>Joh</HI> 14 15. <HI>If ye love me keep my Commandments.</HI> Love is therefore u&s;ed in the Scriptures to expre&s;s all that <HI>Obedience</HI> which we pay to God, in &s;tudying and practi&s;ing uni|ver&s;al conformity to his revealed will. This is rooted in our hearts by the delight we have in his precepts; when we can &s;ay with him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.22 <HI>I delight in the Law of God after the inward man.</HI> And it is exerted in our life, when we devote our whole man to New Obedience; <HI>When we love the Lord our God with all our heart, and all our &s;oul, and all our mind, Matth.</HI> 22.37.</P>
<P>It now follows that we proceed to the re&s;o|lution of the Ca&s;e; and we may take it up in the following Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>This love of ours with which we love God, is not barely a</HI> Natural Affection, <HI>or a</HI> Moral Prin|ciple <HI>in it, but a</HI> Grace of the Spirit. The na|tural
<PB N="11" REF="000961_0008_0FADE5769924E3C0">
affection indeed is the Subject of it, in which it is rooted, but we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween the affection it &s;elf, and the love which is rooted in it. <HI>Love hath Good for its Object</HI>; and &s;uch as the good is, &s;o is the love denomi|nated. We love the things that are &s;uited to our inclinations: and hence there is in Unre|generate men, a <HI>Carnal Love</HI> which inclines them to the gratification of their carnal Lu&s;ts, and &s;o the objects which are &s;uited thereto attract their love. There is a <HI>Natural Love</HI> in men to &s;uch per&s;ons or things as are agreeable to their natures: and there is a love to the things that are <HI>Morally Good and Honest,</HI> which &s;ome Un|converted men have in them, and it proceeds from a principle of Morality, which either re|mains in them notwith&s;tanding the fall, or hath been acquired by them: but none of the&s;e a|mounts to the love which we are now in the Con&s;ideration of: There is then a <HI>Divine Love,</HI> which carries men out to God, and to Heavenly things, and fixeth them there: and this flows from a &s;pecial gracious principle in|fu&s;ed into the man by the Spirit of God, and can claim its Original from no other; it is there|fore called one of the fruits of the Spirit, and is the fir&s;t named, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5 22 <HI>The fruit of the Spirit is love, &amp;c.</HI> This love of God indeed was <HI>Connatural</HI> to man in his &s;tate of integrity, being one of tho&s;e Graces of Sanctification which
<PB N="12" REF="000961_0009_0FADE5775595E4E8">
were concreated in him, and belonged to that <HI>Image of God</HI> which was at fir&s;t put upon him, and adorned him. This love was active and vigorous in man before &s;uch time as he had de|praved him&s;elf by Sin; and <HI>none of the Commands were grievous to him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Apo&s;ta&s;y robbed man of that holy love of God which was at fir&s;t planted in him.</HI> This it did when it &s;tript him of the <HI>Image of God,</HI> in which this and all the other Graces of Sanctification were contained. When man put off the Image from him, all that was Spiritual, or <HI>Theologically</HI> good in him went with it: So that every Un|regenerate man, if he will &s;ay the Truth, mu&s;t confe&s;s of him&s;elf entirely, as <HI>Paul</HI> doth of him|&s;elf in re&s;pect to his wor&s;er part, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.18. <HI>In me, that is in my fle&s;h&punc; there dwells no good thing.</HI> Man, who at fir&s;t loved God as his la&s;t end and chief good, now cea&s;eth to do &s;o, and there is not one &s;park of that primitive love left in him. It is &s;aid of every natural man, <HI>that the love of the Father is not in him,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.15. The Affection of love abides in the man, it being e&s;&s;ential to his Humanity, and in&s;eparable from it; but it hath &s;hifted objects, and exchanged God for the Creature; Unconverted men are &s;aid to be <HI>Lovers of plea&s;ures, more than lovers of God,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.4. And hereupon that is one title put upon ungodly men, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.30. <HI>Haters of God.</HI> So
<PB N="13" REF="000961_0010_0FADE5783147E010">
that their fir&s;t love, in re&s;pect of the object on which it was placed, is turned into hatred.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This love mu&s;t be again recovered by the man, in order to his being made to enjoy God, and to be happy in him.</HI> It is certain that mans true hap|pine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in his enjoying of God, who is the only adequate object of felicity; no other can make a &s;uitable and &s;ufficient portion for the rea&s;onable Creature: to be far from God, is to be mi&s;erable indeed, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 73.27. <HI>For lo, all that are far from thee, &s;hall peri&s;h: In his favour there is life; his loving kindne&s;s is better than life it &s;elf.</HI> Now God is a portion for none but tho&s;e that love him: it is by love that we come to have Communion with him, which is our ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.17. <HI>I love them that love me.</HI> Hatred keeps the Sinner at a di&s;tance from God, and there is a fearful Cur&s;e out again&s;t all &s;uch, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 21.8. <HI>&amp;c. Thine hand &s;hall find out all thine Enemies, thy right hand &s;hall find out tho&s;e that hate thee; thou &s;halt make them as a fiery Oven, &amp;c.</HI> Whereas there is a great Ble&s;&s;ing in &s;tore for &s;uch as love him, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 5.11, 12. <HI>Let them that love thy name, be joyful in thee; for thou Lord, wilt ble&s;s the righteous, with favour wilt thou compa&s;s him as a &s;hield.</HI> It therefore infinitely concerns us all to &s;ee that the love of God dwells in us; and this is it which the Apo&s;tle prays for in
<PB N="14" REF="000961_0011_0FADE57C3ADC1998">
their behalf, 2 The&s; 3.5. <HI>The Lord direct your hearts into the Love of God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It utterly exceeds the power of man to recover this Principle, and the activity of it.</HI> Of the Na|tural mans inability to exert any truly Gracious action, the Scripture abundantly informs us, Jo&s;h. 24 19. <HI>Ye cannot &s;erve God.</HI> Rom. 8.7, 8. <HI>The Carnal mind is Enmity again&s;t God; for it is not &s;ubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the Fle&s;h, cannot plea&s;e God.</HI> 2 Cor. 3 5. <HI>We are not &s;ufficient of our &s;elves to think any thing, as of our &s;elves.</HI> Now this defect ari&s;eth from the lo&s;s of the Image of God on his Heart, and his incapacity of getting it again by any Endeavour of his own. Be|cau&s;e he hath not a root of Grace in him, therefore he cannot act Graciou&s;ly; for <HI>no Effect can exceed the Vertue of its Cau&s;e</HI>: And becau&s;e there is a contrary Principle in him, which reigns over every Faculty and Power within him, he therefore is not able to with|&s;tand it. Indeed he cannot &s;o much as de&s;ire to Love God, much le&s;s is he able to re&s;tore this Grace to his heart again. The Will there|fore as well as the Deed, mu&s;t be of his o|peration in us, Phil. 2.13. <HI>It is God who worketh in you to will and to do, of his own good plea&s;ure.</HI> The re&s;toring of lo&s;t Grace to fallen man is a work of Omnipotency, and therefore none
<PB N="15" REF="000961_0012_0FADE57D3437A530">
but he who is Almighty is able to do it in us: It is therefore compared to a Creation, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.6. <HI>God who commanded the light to &s;hine out of the darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined in our hearts, &amp;c.</HI> And to a Re&s;urrection, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.1. <HI>You hath he quickned, who were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins.</HI> Love is a thing that is not to be purcha&s;ed; <HI>all that a man would offer for it will be de&s;pi&s;ed, Cant.</HI> 8 7. Which may be interpreted: well of our loving God, as of his loving us.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>This love is a &s;aving gift, and therefore mu&s;t have God for its Author.</HI> It is one of tho&s;e things which we are told <HI>do accompany Salvation, Heb.</HI> 6 9. and is therefore called <HI>a fruit of the Spirit,</HI> in the fore-cited, Gal. 5.22. This love is an effect of the New birth, whereof God is the Author, 1 <HI>John</HI> 4.7. <HI>Love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God.</HI> And indeed, it being one of the Graces of Sanctification, it mu&s;t needs proceed from Gods Efficiency, for it is he that <HI>Sanctifieth us,</HI> 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5.23. And the wonderful change that is made in the man by it, mu&s;t force us to &s;ay of it, <HI>behold the finger of God.</HI> To &s;ee one who the other day de&s;pi&s;ed God, had no de&s;ire after him, had him to depart from him, cho&s;e carnal objects, lying vanities rather than him; nay, hated his coun&s;els, and was full of all pre|judices again&s;t him; now to love him, to chu&s;e him, to embrace him, to for&s;ake all for him,
<PB N="16" REF="000961_0013_0FADE57D5E8DC318">
to &s;ubmit to him, and delight in his Service&punc; is a thing of which no other account can be given, but <HI>that God hath created him a new in Chri&s;t Je|&s;us,</HI> that he hath given him another and a <HI>New heart,</HI> or otherwi&s;e it could never have been.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>There was nothing in us that could move God to produce this &s;aving quality in us.</HI> In all volun|tary actions, which are done by a Rational A|gent, we are wont to enquire after the <HI>Impul&s;ive cau&s;e</HI> of them, or what it was that moved and engaged him &s;o to do: and by &s;uch mea&s;ures as the&s;e are we nece&s;&s;itated to conceive of Gods Works of Efficiency: It is a demon&s;tration of Gods wonderful love to us, that he will put a principle of Sanctification into us, and thereby <HI>re&s;tores us from death to life,</HI> and whence was it that he &s;o did; or what was it that induced him hereunto? Certainly it could not be from any loveline&s;s that he &s;aw in us, for there was none; we had nothing in us that was de&s;ira|ble, but every thing was hateful&punc; the <HI>Image of God,</HI> which once was our beauty and orna|ment was gone; and the <HI>Image of Sin</HI>&punc; which is our &s;hame and vilene&s;s was contracted, and by virtue of it we were every way abomina|ble: when therefore God &s;peaks of doing &s;uch things for back&s;lidden <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> he would have them to take that humbling remark upon it, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.22. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, I do not this

for your &s;akes, Oh hou&s;e of I&s;rael but for mine holy names &s;ake, &amp;c.</HI> Nor was he moved here|of by our reque&s;ts and prayers; it was not becau&s;e we, in &s;en&s;e of our folly and mi&s;ery, &s;ought relief of him, that his bowels earned towards us, for he him&s;elf &s;aith&punc; <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 65.1. <HI>I am &s;ought of them that asked not for me, I am found of them that &s;ought me not</HI>&punc; and though he, hath declared, in <HI>Ezek.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">6.37. <HI>I will yet for this be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to do it for them.</HI> Yet his <HI>preventing grace</HI> produ|ceth this in us, otherwi&s;e we &s;hould never have thus enquired after him, but abode in our di|&s;tance from him.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>It was this love that appointed us to be the heirs of Salvation.</HI> The Word of God doth fre|quently expre&s;s our Salvation under the con&s;ide|ration of an <HI>Inheritance</HI>; and &s;o all the claims that we can make to it, mu&s;t be in way of <HI>Heir|&s;hip</HI>: and we are not born heirs to it by a na|tural birth, but are introduced into it by a vo|luntary <HI>Adoption</HI>: we had in our &s;elves no more of right to it than the Devils, nor could we make out a better claim to it than the re&s;t of A|po&s;tate mankind: we were common heirs with them of the &s;ame de&s;truction, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.3. <HI>Being children of wrath by nature even as others.</HI> We therefore come to have a right thereto according to appointment, 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5.9. <HI>God hath not ap|pointed us to wrath, but to obtain Salvation by Je&s;us Christ.</HI> Nor can there be a greater obligation upon us to love God, than the con&s;ideration of this eternal de&s;ign: to think that God had &s;uch a thought of good will for us, when he propo&s;ed no &s;uch favour for millions as good, and as well de&s;erving as we; and this is owing to his love, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.1. <HI>Behold what manner of love the Fa+ther hath be&s;towed, upon us&punc; that we &s;hould be called the Sons of God?</HI> And &s;ure this love mu&s;t be more ancient than ours to him, who but the

<P N="2">2. <HI>This love provided Chri&s;t to purcha&s;e Salvati|on for us.</HI> Such was our unhappy condition by the Fall, that there could be no &s;alvation for us, but by a &s;atisfaction made to offended Ju&s;tice, which Attribute mu&s;t not in the lea&s;t vail its glory in this affair, or &s;o much as &s;toop to mer|cy in it. If God will &s;ave us, he mu&s;t provide a <HI>Je&s;us</HI> for us, one that can <HI>&s;ave us from our &s;ins.</HI> The Law mu&s;t have a reparation made for the violation of it; our contracted Guilt mu&s;t be ex|piated; we cannot do this for our &s;elves, <HI>thou|&s;ands of rams, and ten thou&s;and rivers of oyl</HI> will not do it; there mu&s;t a <HI>Surety</HI> interpo&s;e to un|dertake this, none could do it but the Son of God, he mu&s;t be made <HI>Sin</HI> and a <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> for us, he mu&s;t have <HI>all our Iniquities laid upon him, and by his &s;tripes we mu&s;t be healed</HI>: the ca&s;e was re|duced to this exigence, either God mu&s;t de&s;troy us everla&s;tingly for our &s;ins, or do the execution upon his own Son in our &s;tead; nothing el&s;e would have done: Certainly then here was love unparallel'd: Chri&s;t him&s;elf expre&s;&s;eth it as that which exceeds all compari&s;on, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. <HI>God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son&punc;</HI> And the Apo&s;tle thought it to be an argu|ment which could not be over &s;trained, in the exerci&s;e of our faith for the obtaining of all the good that is laid up in the promi&s;e, <HI>Rom</HI> 8.

<P N="4">4. <HI>This love hath pointed out to us the way of Salvation by Christ.</HI> As God hath laid it in Chri&s;t for us, &s;o he hath in the Go&s;pel di&s;|covered the way of it to us. There is a <HI>way</HI> in which Sinful men mu&s;t come to partake in the precious fruits of Chri&s;t Redemption, and there are <HI>terms</HI> on which the&s;e are con|veyed to us; now God hath opened the&s;e terms, and laid out all the Articles of the New Co|venant in his Go&s;pel. This is not a favour which all partake in: it is &s;aid of the Gentiles, who are without the Go&s;pel, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.17. <HI>The way of peace have they not known.</HI> And we are told in, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.10. <HI>That God hath brought life and immortality to light through the Go&s;pel.</HI> There are the propo&s;als in the New-Covenant

<P N="5">5. <HI>This love hath not only provided the means, but al&s;o renders them effectual to our Salvation.</HI> God brings about the Salvation of his Elect in the way of means, as be&s;t accommodated to his treating of them as rea&s;onable Creatures; he hath therefore appointed them in the Go&s;|pel; and they are the <HI>gifts</HI> of our glorified Saviour, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.10. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is therefore a &s;ingu|lar favour for men to enjoy them; there is that remark&punc; <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 147.19, 20. <HI>He &s;hewed his word unto Jacob, his &s;tatutes and his judgments unto I&s;rael; he hath not dealt &s;o with any nation, &amp;c.</HI> And it mu&s;t be &s;o, for the want of them is a note of perdition, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.3. <HI>If our Go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t.</HI> But yet many have them, and they prove occa&s;ions of their greater ruine, becau&s;e they abu&s;e them: Herein therefore is Gods love, antecedently to ours eminently celebrated, in that he gives a ble&s;&s;ing to the means, and &s;o making them powerful to advance the end of them, <HI>Rom.</HI>

<P><HI>We may hence infer the Doctrine of per&s;onal E|lection.</HI> Great attempts have been and are u&s;ed in the Chri&s;tian world to undermine this truth, but all are in vain: If there were no more Scripture evidence for the confirmation and e&s;tabli&s;hment of this <HI>Article</HI> of our faith, but only the words of our <HI>Text,</HI> it is &s;ufficient to enervate all the cavils and objections that are brought again&s;t it.
