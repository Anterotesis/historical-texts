<HEAD>A <HI>BILL</HI> for e&s;tabli&s;hing <HI>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM,</HI> printed for the con&s;ideration of the <HI>PEOPLE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WELL aware that the opinions and belief of men depend not on their own will, but follow involunta|rily the evidence propo&s;ed to their minds, that Almighty God hath created the mind free, and manife&s;ted his Supreme will that free it &s;hall remain, by making it altogether in&s;u&s;ceptible of re&s;traint: That all attempts to influence it by temporal puni&s;hment or burthens, or by civil inca|pacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocri&s;y and meanne&s;s, and are a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet cho&s;e not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do, but to extend it by its influence on rea&s;on alone: That the impious pre&s;umption of legi&s;lators and rulers, civil as well as eccle&s;ia&s;tical, who, being them&s;elves but fallible and unin|&s;pired men, have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> dominion over the faith of others, &s;etting up their own opinions and modes of think|ing, as the only true and infallible, and as &s;uch, endeavouring to impo&s;e them on others, hath e&s;tabli&s;hed and maintained fal&s;e religions over the greate&s;t part of the world, and through all time: That to compel a man to furni&s;h contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he di&s;believes and abhors, is &s;inful and tyrannical: That even the forcing him to &s;upport this or that teacher of his own religious per&s;ua&s;ion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pa&s;tor who&s;e morals he would make his pattern, and who&s;e powers he feels mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive to righteou&s;ne&s;s, and is withdrawing from the M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">try tho&s;e temporal rewards which, proceeding from an approbation of their per&s;onal conduct, are an additional incitement to earne&s;t and unremitting labour for the in&s;truction of mankind: That our civil rights have no dependance on our religious opinions, any more than on our opinions in phy&s;icks or geometry: <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> therefore the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">or&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ribing any citizen as unworthy the publick confidence, by laying upon him an in<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">apacity of being called to offices of tru&s;t and emolument, unle&s;s he profe&s;s or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriou&s;ly of tho&s;e privileges and advantages to which, in common with his fellow citizens he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">s a natural right: That it tends al&s;o to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing with a monopoly of worldly honours and emoluments, tho&s;e who will externally profe&s;s and conform to it: That though indeed the&s;e are criminal who do not with&s;tand &s;uch temptation, yet neither are tho&s;e innocent who lay the bait in their way That the opinions of men are not the object of civil government, nor under its juri&s;diction: That to &s;uffer the civil Magi&s;trate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to re&s;train the profe&s;&s;ion or propagation of principles on &s;uppo&s;ition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once de&s;troys all religious liberty; becau&s;e he being of cour&s;e Judge of that tendency will make his own opinions the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the &s;entiments of others only as they &s;hall &s;quare with, or differ from his own: That it is time enough for the rightful purpo&s;es of civil government for its officers to interfere when principles break out into over<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">acts again&s;t peace and good order: And finally, that truth is great and will prevail if left to her&s;elf; that &s;he is the proper and &s;ufficient antagoni&s;t to errour, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unle&s;s by human interpo&s;ition, di&s;armed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate; errours cea&s;ing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them</P>
<P>WE the General A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Virginia</HI> do enact, that no man &s;hall be compelled to frequent or &s;upport any religous Wor&s;hip place or Mini&s;try what&s;oever, nor &s;hall be enforced, re&s;trained, mole&s;ted, or burthened in his body or goods, nor &s;hall otherwi&s;e &s;uffer on account of his religious opinions or belief, but that all men &s;hall be free to profe&s;s, and by argument to maintain their opinions in matters of religion, and that the &s;ame &s;hall in no wi&s;e dimini&s;h, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.</P>
<P>AND though we well know that this A&s;&s;embly, elected by the people for the ordinary purpo&s;es of legi&s;lation only, have no power to re&s;train the acts of &s;ucceeding A&s;&s;emblies, con&s;tituted with powers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act irrevocable would be of no effect in law; yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby a&s;&s;erted are of the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act &s;hall be hereafter pa&s;&s;ed to repeal the pre&s;ent, or to narrow its operation, &s;uch act will be an infringement of natural right.</P>
