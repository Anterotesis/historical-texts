<P>THE Committee con&s;i&s;ting of Mr. Beresford, Mr. Jeffer&s;on, Mr. Cha&s;e, Mr. Spaight and Mr. Read, appointed to take into con&s;ideration the &s;tate of Indian affairs in the Southern Department, beg leave to REPORT:</P>
<P>That a report was made upon Indian affairs in the northern and middle departments, and being amended, was agreed to on the 15th of October 1783: That, as many of the principles contained in that report will apply with equal propriety to the &s;outhern depart|ment, and the &s;en&s;e of Congre&s;s was then expre&s;&s;ed, the committee propo&s;e, &s;o often as the circum&s;tances agree, to adopt them in the pre&s;ent. That the department con&s;igned to their particular con&s;ideration extends, as it is defined by an act of Congre&s;s of July 12, 1775, &s;o far northward as to include the Cherokees, and &s;o far &s;outhward as to include all the other &s;outhern tribes.</P>
<P>That all claims made by South-Carolina and Georgia upon the Indians have been &s;ati&s;|fied. That in a conference with a deputation of Indians held in Charle&s;ton, South-Caroli|na, in December 1782, by governor Matthews, there appeared in them a pacific di&s;po&s;i|tion; and from the circum&s;tances in which our treaty with Great-Britain has left the ho&s;tile Indians, the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be univer&s;al among them. That the pre&s;ervation thereof is an object greatly de&s;ireable; for though a weak, they are a de&s;truct|ive foe; and in a conte&s;t with them much may be lo&s;t, but nothing won which will be u&s;eful to us, or which will not be more u&s;eful when it will be more ea&s;ily won. That if an Indian war &s;hould be rekindled, repeated victories might produce the retreat of the In|dians, but could not prevent them from regaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of the di&s;tant territory of the United States: That while &s;uch temporary expul&s;ions could only be effected at a great charge, they could not be maintained but by numerous garri&s;ons, and an expen&s;ive peace e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. That even if the Indians could be totally expelled, the policy of reducing them to &s;uch an extremity is deemed que&s;tionable; for in ca&s;e of any future rupture with Great-Britain, they would thereby become an u&s;eful ally to that power, and a formidable enemy to the United States. That it is highly fortunate that in the &s;outhern department no &s;ub|ject of contention threatens us when we are but little prepared to contend; yet how long that may continue, which at pre&s;ent &s;eems to be in &s;ome degree the effect of di&s;appointment and de&s;pair&punc; it cannot now be a&s;certained, and it will probably depend upon the mea|&s;ures which the occa&s;ion may &s;ugge&s;t. That genero&s;ity, clemency and mercy, ought to appear in the tran&s;actions of the grand council of the United States, with a people who live in a lamentable &s;tate of ignorance and error; and that the&s;e will perhaps be found ul|timately <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">o compo&s;e the be&s;t policy. That &s;o often as the intere&s;ts of both parties can be made to accord, mutual advantage ought to be attempted; and that nothing el&s;e can form &s;o &s;olid and durable a foundation for harmony and peace. That &s;mall benefits &s;hould be cheerfully re&s;igned for the probable attainment of tho&s;e which are important, more e&s;pe|cially as it cannot be pre&s;umed the Indians will in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances venture upon any extravagant demands.</P>
<P>That Congre&s;s, however de&s;irous they may be to gratify their better feelings in acts of humanity, will not be warranted in advancing beyond the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of their con&s;ti|tuents: and furthermore, genero&s;ity becomes bankrupt, and fru&s;trates its own de&s;igns by prodigal bounty. That the &s;tates which are inhabited by the Indians in the &s;outhern de|partment, have in common with the re&s;t of the United States, pledged them&s;elves for the payment of the public debts; that ju&s;tice, gratitude and good policy, direct them to make ample provi&s;ion more e&s;pecially for their own quota of the virtuous army, who&s;e patient courage has &s;o eminently conduced to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their liberty and independence; that it is become nece&s;&s;ary by the increa&s;e of dome&s;tic population and emigration from abroad, to provide &s;peedily for the &s;ettlement of their re&s;pective territories, and their finan|ces do not admit of any con&s;iderable expenditure to extingui&s;h the Indian claims upon &s;uch lands&mdash;The committee are therefore of opinion, that the Indians in the &s;outhern depart|ment, &s;hould be prevailed upon to a&s;certain and e&s;tabli&s;h between the United States and them&s;elves, &s;uch lines of property, and to make &s;uch ce&s;&s;ions of uncultivated land to the &s;tates they inhabit re&s;pectively, as may be convenient to tho&s;e nations, and commen&s;urate to the pre&s;ent and approaching nece&s;&s;ities of tho&s;e &s;tates. Nor, in the opinion of the com|mittee, can the Indians make any rea&s;onable objection again&s;t the mea&s;ures recommended. They were them&s;elves aggre&s;&s;ors in the war, without even a pretence of provocation; and the barbarities which attend their mode of warfare are too &s;hocking and of too great no|toriety to be here recited. The&s;e circum&s;tances are &s;ufficient to manife&s;t the obligation they are under to make atonement for their outrages, and a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation for the expences and alarms to which they have expo&s;ed their unoffending neighbours; and they po&s;&s;e&s;s no other means to do this act of ju&s;tice than by a compliance with the propo&s;ed terms.</P>
<P>The committee are of opinion, that care &s;hould be taken neither to yield nor require too much; to accommodate the Indians as far as the public good will admit, and to avoid the hazard of a war, the expences of which may exceed the value of the acqui&s;ition fought for: but it is &s;uppo&s;ed that when they &s;hall have been informed of the damages which our citizens have &s;u&s;tained from their irruptions, and tho&s;e of their Briti&s;h ally, all unrea&s;onable expectations will be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed&mdash; Whereupon</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That conventions be held with the Indians re&s;iding in the &s;outhern department, who have taken up arms again&s;t the United States, for the purpo&s;e of receiving them into the favor of the United States, and of e&s;tabli&s;hing boundary lines of property for &s;eparating and dividing the &s;et|tlements of the citizens of the United States from the Indian villages and hunting grounds, and thereby extingui&s;hing as far as po&s;&s;ible, all occa&s;ion for future animo&s;ity, di&s;quiet and co<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">tion. That,</P>
<P><PB REF="018830_0002_0FA9B58A87AB8810">Fir&s;t, and as a preliminary, it &s;hall be required, that all pri&s;oners of whatever age or &s;ex among the Indians, and all fugitive and other &s;laves, &s;hall be delivered up.</P>
<P>Secondly. That the Indians be informed, that after a conte&s;t of eight years for the &s;o|vereignty of this country, Great-Britain has relinqui&s;hed to the United States all claim to the country within the limits de&s;cribed by the &s;econd article of the definitive treaty be|tween the United States and the king of Great-Britain, &s;igned on the third day of Septem|ber, in the year 1783; that is to &s;ay,</P>
<P>(Here in&s;ert the limits.)</P>
<P>Thirdly. That as the Indians in contempt of every principle of ju&s;tice and humanity, regardle&s;s of the friendly temper and de&s;igns of the United States, and in defiance of their power or re&s;entment, were determined to join their arms to tho&s;e of Great-Britain and to &s;hare her fortunes, &s;o con&s;equently by a le&s;s generous people than Americans, they might be compelled to retire to the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the continent. But as we prefer cle|mency to rigor, as we per&s;uade our&s;elves that their eyes are open to their error, and that they have found by fatal experience, that their true intere&s;t and &s;afety mu&s;t depend upon our friend&s;hip; as the country is large enough to maintain and &s;upport us all; and as we are di&s;po&s;ed to be kind to them, to &s;upply their wants, and to partake of their trade; we, from the&s;e con&s;iderations, and from motives of compa&s;&s;ion, draw a veil over what is pa&s;t, and will e&s;tabli&s;h a boundary line between us and them, beyond which we will re&s;train our citizens from hunting and &s;ettling, and within which the Indians &s;hall not come but for the purpo&s;es of trading, treating, or other bu&s;ine&s;s equally unexceptionable. That Congre&s;s are de&s;irous that the mo&s;t friendly intercour&s;e may &s;ub&s;i&s;t between us, and that all commercial tran&s;actions may be conducted upon the mo&s;t equitable principles, and &s;uch as may equally promote the intere&s;ts of both parties. But that they take warning of the perils of a fre&s;h rupture. That a &s;econd injury is more grievous than the fir&s;t. That an offence again&s;t one &s;tate will be re&s;ented by the whole. That their friends have de&s;erted them, and that our arms obliged them to do &s;o: that without their friends they mu&s;t be immediately overwhelmed. That we al&s;o have friends who never deceived us; but on the contrary enabled us to capture an army the lo&s;s of which ruined the Briti&s;h cau&s;e in America. That their friends, in the late treaty of peace, left them to the mercy of their enemies, having made no &s;tipulation in their favor; yet that we are not di&s;po&s;ed to take ad|vantage of their di&s;tre&s;s: that men ought to be preferred who are merciful as enemies to men who are treacherous as friends.</P>
<P>Fourthly. The commi&s;&s;ioners which &s;hall be appointed to treat with the&s;e Indians, are in&s;tructed to u&s;e their own di&s;cretion in e&s;tabli&s;hing between the United States and the &s;e|veral nations of Indians, the mo&s;t advantageous boundary lines to which they can be in|duced to accede; unle&s;s they &s;hall hereafter be otherwi&s;e directed by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The commi&s;&s;ioners are in&s;tructed to treat with the Indian nations collectively, or at different times and places as they &s;hall find mo&s;t conducive to the Intere&s;t of the Unit|ed States, care being taken to avert the mi&s;chiefs which may ari&s;e from united councils or powerful combinations among the Indians, and to encourage in them every di&s;po&s;ition to act independently.</P>
<P>Sixthly The commi&s;&s;ioners are in&s;tructed not to admit into a treaty with the Indians, or &s;uffer to be in any manner connected with it, any article, &s;tipulation or condition what|&s;oever, making or confirming, or tending to make or confirm to any individual or indivi|duals, any grant or grants of land, whether real or pretended, within the bounds of the United States as before de&s;cribed. Moreover that no treaty which may have been conclu|ded with the Indians by any &s;tate or &s;tates, and not by the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;em|bled, for obtaining land or for any other purpo&s;e, &s;hall be confirmed by the treaty or trea|ties now propo&s;ed to be held; unle&s;s the &s;aid treaties which may have been concluded by &s;uch &s;tate or &s;tates, appear manife&s;tly and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;ign of the trea|ties now propo&s;ed to be held.</P>
<P>Seventhly. The commi&s;&s;ioners are in&s;tructed to take &s;ecurity from the Indians, for the performance of their engagements, if they &s;hall find this mea&s;ure practicable.</P>
<P>Eighthly. The commi&s;&s;ioners are in&s;tructed to warn all per&s;ons not properly authorized, from tra|ding with the Indians. That the commi&s;&s;ioners do not allow the Indian traders to take advantage of the intoxication of the Indians, or to wrong them in any manner in their dealings: and in order that the traders may be kept under the controul of the commi&s;&s;ioners, and that their fidelity may be en|&s;ured, and the&s;e evils may be prevented, the commi&s;&s;ioners are in&s;tructed to put them under the obligation of a bond with good and &s;ufficient &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Ninthly. The commi&s;&s;ioners are in&s;tructed to encourage the Indians to give intelligence of any mi&s;chievous de&s;igns which may be concerted in any neighbouring tribe again&s;t the United States; thus will evil be prevented in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and the &s;trength of the Indians be divided, and dimini&s;hed by violated faith, &s;hould any tribe, at pre&s;ent friendly to us, become in future ho&s;tile and threaten an inva&s;ion. That the commi&s;&s;ioners take proper &s;teps for obtaining and tran&s;mitting &s;uch intelligence with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.</P>
<P>Tenthly. That it be recommended to the executive of the &s;tate of South-Carolina, to furni&s;h the commi&s;&s;ioners which &s;hall be appointed to treat with the Indians in the &s;outhern department, with all &s;uch goods and &s;ums of money as may be nece&s;&s;ary at the propo&s;ed treaty or treaties, and fully to carry into effect he views of the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled; and that a credit &s;hall be allowed to the &s;aid &s;tate for the amount of &s;uch advances as part of the quota of the &s;aid &s;tate on any of the requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s again&s;t the &s;aid &s;tate now un&s;atisfied. But if the &s;tate of South-Carolina, &s;hould fail to grant the &s;upplies above mentioned, that the &s;uperintendant of finance be directed to purcha&s;e goods of &s;uch kinds as are mo&s;t u&s;eful and acceptable to the Indians, to the amount of  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  dollars. And that the goods or &s;ums of money which may be furni&s;hed by the executive of
<PB REF="018830_0003_0FA9B58B44393510" MS="y">
South-Carolina, or the &s;uperintendant of finance, be depo&s;ited in the hands of the commi&s;&s;ioners, they having previou&s;ly appointed an agent, &s;ubject to their orders, to take them under his care. That the commi&s;&s;ioners make the u&s;ual pre&s;ents to the Indians at their fir&s;t interview. That the re&s;t of the goods be di&s;po&s;ed of at &s;uch prices as &s;hall appear to the commi&s;&s;ioners prudent and convenient.</P>
<P>Eleventhly. That the commi&s;&s;ioners u&s;e &s;uch arguments as &s;hall appear to them mo&s;t likely to prevail with the Indians, to enter into the &s;ociety of the citizens of the United States: and that they make them acquainted with &s;uch laws as exi&s;t in the different &s;tates, particularly tho&s;e in their vicinity, for the encouragement of new &s;ettlers.</P>
<P>The committee, are moreover of opinion, that commi&s;&s;ioners not exceeding  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  in number with &s;alaries of  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  dollars per day each, exclu&s;ive of their expences, be immediately appointed with in&s;tructions to form a treaty or treaties with the Indians in the &s;outhern department, upon the prin|ciples contained in the foregoing report, &s;o far as &s;hall be con&s;i&s;tent with the articles of confederation.</P>
<P>The committee al&s;o think it advi&s;eable, that Congre&s;s recommend that laws be pa&s;&s;ed for prevent|ing per&s;ons not authori&s;ed by Congre&s;s, from trading with the Indians: al&s;o for the &s;ecurity of the Indians, and the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e who &s;hall invade them, or in any manner treat them unju&s;tly, and thereby endanger the tranquility of the United States: al&s;o to adapt their laws as much as convenient to the purpo&s;e of inducing the Indians to become citizens.</P>
<P>The committee upon Indian affairs in the &s;outhern department, have al&s;o been directed to take under con&s;ideration &s;everal papers, con&s;i&s;ting of a letter from general Wilkin&s;on, to the pre&s;ident, dated falls of Ohio, January 17th, 1784; a letter from Mr. J. Donne, to general Wilkin&s;on, of the &s;ame date; a talk of five chiefs of the Chicke&s;aw nation of Indians, dated Chuck-ul-i&s;&s;ah, July 20th, 1783, addre&s;&s;ed to the pre&s;ident, and forwarded by Mr. Donne, through general Wilkin&s;on; al&s;o a copy of the commi&s;&s;ion of captain Colbert, taken from the original by Mr. Donne, under which he &s;erved the king of Great Britain in the late war, and commanded a volunteer corps of white men and &s;outhern Indians, al&s;o forwarded by Mr. Donne. The committee have attentively peru&s;ed the&s;e papers, and from the repre&s;entations they contain, have agreed to report their opinion as follows.</P>
<P>That long before the declaration of peace with Great Britain, and as early as the beginning of the year 1782, the Chicke&s;aw nation of Indians made overtures for a peace with the United States, but before a me&s;&s;enger di&s;patched by general Clark, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in concluding the &s;ame, could reach their country, the hunting &s;ea&s;on had arrived, and the chiefs were abroad; but that the mo&s;t friendly di&s;po&s;ition prevailed throughout the nation; and that they have remained in this di&s;po&s;ition ever &s;ince. That attempts have been made by the Spaniards to attach them to their intere&s;ts, but they prefer a connexion with us, and have formed a re&s;olution to accept of no advantages, which have been offered to them, unle&s;s they &s;hall be driven to that re&s;ource by our neglect, and are now anxiou&s;|ly waiting the re&s;ult of their application to Congre&s;s. That they have expelled out of their nation, all tho&s;e who were on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, under Colbert, le&s;t their pre&s;ence &s;hould be offen&s;ive to the Americans. That although long &s;ince de&s;irous of peace, they have been confu&s;ed and perplexed with contradictory accounts, and knew not where they &s;hould make their application, whether to any &s;tate in their vicinity or to Congre&s;s. That they were finally determined by the advice of Mr. J. Donne, at this time, or heretofore, an officer of the &s;tate of Virginia, (and as the committee be|lieve) in the Indian department; and that they promi&s;ed to confide in the an&s;wer he &s;hould return them. That during the Briti&s;h government, the Indian nations were accu&s;tomed to have a com|mi&s;&s;ary re&s;iding among them, who <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> be known their wants, &s;tudied their ruling pa&s;&s;ions, and became &s;o u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary to them that he was &s;tyled the <HI>beloved man.</HI> That by his influence it was ea&s;y to excite them to war or compo&s;e them to peace. That he could ea&s;ily preclude or expel from among them characters unfriendly to his de&s;igns. That he acted frequently as a magi&s;trate in &s;ettling di&s;putes among the Indians, and al&s;o among the white re&s;idents; and from his importance with both the&s;e parties may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been often u&s;efully employed as a mediator between them. That he prevented innovations on the e&s;tabli&s;hed trade of the Indians; and, by keeping a watchful eye over their conduct, with held them from the pur&s;uit of new objects, and &s;ecured their attachment to his own cau&s;e. That &s;uch a per&s;on is peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary at this time among the Chicke&s;aws, they having made it an earne&s;t reque&s;t, being very importunate for &s;upplies, particularly ammunition and cloathing, being alarmed and exa&s;perated by the menaces of mi&s;chievous per&s;ons, who threaten to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their country, and being expo&s;ed to the arts of the Spaniards and to the temp|tations of their proferred trade. That captain James Colbert, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es con&s;iderable influence over the Chicke&s;aws, Chacktaws, and Creeks; and although by his activity again&s;t the Spaniards during the late war, he had made him&s;elf very obnoxious to them, yet they have been &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his importance, as to make propo&s;als to him; that he has thought proper to decline the &s;ame, hoping to meet with a favourable reception from the Americans; that ever &s;ince the peace he has been principally in&s;trumental in baffling the Spaniards in their attempts to tamper with the Chicke&s;aws, and in pre&s;erving order and &s;teadine&s;s among the Indians, and promi&s;es to employ all his intere&s;t for the&s;e purpo&s;es until he &s;hall be informed of the de&s;tiny which awaits him. That he is di&s;po&s;ed to enter into the employment of the Uni|ted States, urging, "that his having &s;erved his ma&s;ter faithfully, ought not to be brought in evidence again&s;t him, and that he was now de&s;erted by that ma&s;ter." That &s;hould the good offices of this man be re|jected, &s;ome di&s;advantage and danger are to be apprehended from his de&s;pair, that it will therefore be prudent to &s;ecure him to our party by a &s;ubordinate office in the Indian department. That Mr. Donne, who has furni&s;hed Congre&s;s with the late communications, appears to have obtained a con|&s;iderable in&s;ight into Indian affairs, and from the character he &s;eems to have &s;u&s;tained, is worthy of the notice of Congre&s;s: That it is expedient that a talk be forthwith returned by Congre&s;s, in an|&s;wer to the talk lately received from five chiefs of the Chicke&s;aw nation.</P>
<P>Whereupon the committee have come to the following re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. That &s;uperintendants of Indian affairs be immediately appointed, not exceeding  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  in number, with &s;alaries of  <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">  dollars each, to re&s;ide at &s;uch places as &s;hall be named by the com|mi&s;&s;ioners appointed or to be appointed for &s;ettling a peace with the Indians, in the department to which each &s;uperintendant may re&s;pectively belong: and that they be &s;ubject to &s;uch orders and regulations as &s;hall be framed and agreed to by the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners in their re&s;pective departments, until the further plea&s;ure of Congre&s;s be known. Moreover that the &s;uperintendant of Indian affairs in the di&s;trict inhabited by the Chicke&s;aws be, and he is hereby directed, to employ Mr. James Col|bert, in the &s;ervice of the United States, in the Indian department, in &s;uch manner as &s;hall be&s;t pro|mote the honor and intere&s;t of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That a committee be appointed to prepare a talk, in an&s;wer to the talk lately received from five chiefs of the Chicke&s;aw-nation.</P>
