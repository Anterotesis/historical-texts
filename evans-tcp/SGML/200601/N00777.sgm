<HEAD>A Faithful Advice, FROM Several MINISTERS of the Go&s;pel, in and near <HI>Boston,</HI> unto the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI>; relating to the Dangers that may ari&s;e from <HI>Impostors,</HI> pretending to be <HI>Mini&s;ters.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is not without &s;ome Concern upon our Minds, that in the late Writings of our <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Bretheren in <HI>England,</HI> we find awful Complaints, about <Q><HI>Bold</HI>
<HI>Intruders</HI> into the Work of the Mini&s;try, &amp; the &s;warming of that <HI>Vermine,</HI> with an hide|ous Noi&s;e, not in <HI>Corners</HI> and <HI>Chambers,</HI> but in the very <HI>Pulpits</HI>; likely to prove an <HI>E|gyptian</HI> plague;</Q>
upon which they add,
<Q>If the&s;e Illiterate U&s;urpers are not &s;peedily and effectually di&s;countenanced by Mini|&s;ters and People too, they who are alrea|dy the <HI>Blemi&s;h</HI> of <HI>Nonconformity,</HI> will quick|ly prove the total Ruine of it.</Q>
But it &s;atis|fied us more than a little, to hear of their care that the Confu&s;ions thus complained, may be prevented, by a <HI>Vote</HI> of this Impor|tance,
<PB N="4" REF="000935_0003_0FAD922C97225D00">
That they would Employ none to <HI>Preach</HI> in any of their <HI>Pulpits,</HI> but &s;uch as ei|ther arrived unto them with credible <HI>Te&s;timo|nials,</HI> or &s;ubmitted them&s;elves unto a &s;olemn <HI>Trial</HI> of their Qualifications for the Evange|lical Mini&s;try. Our <HI>Congregational</HI> Bretheren in <HI>England,</HI> being alarumed with a clamour of the Dangers hence ari&s;ing to the Intere&s;ts of our Holy Religion, we do with a like &s;atisfaction find, they have lately publi&s;hed a Declaration, wherein, &s;ignifying,
<Q>That ina&s;|much as they count none meet to di&s;pen&s;e the Oracles of God unto others, who are not them&s;elves Qualified for Communion in all Ordinances, their joining them&s;elves to a <HI>particular Church</HI> of Chri&s;t, would be a good Expedient to prevent <HI>Ignorant and Ra&s;h Intruders into the Mini&s;try</HI>; &s;eeing then, it would be the Duty of <HI>Particular Churches</HI> and their Officers, to take &s;pecial care, that none of their Communion, who are not <HI>Qualified,</HI> may enter on that Work; they thereupon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, We Expre&s;s our Di&s;like, and witne&s;s again&s;t all <HI>Ignorant</HI> and <HI>Scanda|lous</HI> per&s;ons, Entring on the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI>; and we do in the Bowels of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, pray and be&s;eech all &s;uch as fear God, that they give not the lea&s;t Encou|ragement unto the Preaching of men, either <HI>Ignorant</HI> or <HI>Erroneous</HI> in the Great Articles

of Faith, or <HI>Scandalous</HI> in their Lives and Conver&s;ations, or otherwi&s;e <HI>Unmeet for this Holy Employment,</HI> Le&s;t they bring the <HI>Guilt of the&s;e mens Sins on their own Souls.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In Conformity to this <HI>Watchfulne&s;s</HI> of our <HI>United Brethren,</HI> we cannot but in the mo&s;t publick manner, call upon our Churches, that they beware of all undue <HI>Precipitancy,</HI> in their Admitting <HI>Unqualified per&s;ons,</HI> to be Re|ceived and Employed, in the Character of <HI>Preachers</HI> unto them.</P>
<P>We have indeed often wi&s;hed, That the Young men brought up in our own <HI>Univer&s;i|ty,</HI> might appear with <HI>Testimonials,</HI> under the Hands of the <HI>Prae&s;ident</HI> and <HI>Fellows,</HI> That up|on <HI>Trial,</HI> they are found <HI>Able</HI> and <HI>Pious,</HI> and likely to be <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> unto the <HI>Churches</HI>; be|fore the <HI>Churches</HI> venture too far in &s;etting of them up for <HI>Preachers.</HI></P>
<P>But ina&s;much as there have &s;ometimes ar|rived among us, <HI>Deceitful Strangers,</HI> who have &s;et up them&s;elves for <HI>Preachers,</HI> and many un|wary people have di&s;covered much &s;inful Folly, in &s;uffering them&s;elves to be <HI>&s;trangely Deceived</HI> by tho&s;e <HI>Impo&s;tors,</HI> it obliges us un|to a further point of <HI>Pa&s;toral Vigilance</HI> over the <HI>Churches,</HI> whereof we are made the <HI>Over&s;eers.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis well known, That Worthy <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Go&s;pel, Retiring to <HI>New-England,</HI> from other Countreys, have all along met
<PB N="6" REF="000935_0005_0FAD922FA2CA6AF8">
with Re&s;pects from our Churches, <HI>Equal</HI> (to &s;ay no more) unto what they have &s;hown unto any of the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> bred among them|&s;elves; Heaven is witne&s;s, to the Inju&s;tice of the Slander by &s;ome uttered again&s;t us, <HI>That we have been ever uncivil to Strangers</HI>; and the <HI>Strangers</HI> them&s;elves have been Witne&s;&s;es, that no where under Heaven could they expect more <HI>Civility,</HI> than that wherewith we have ever treated them.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, we have, upon &s;ufficient Oc|ca&s;ions Re&s;olved,
<Q>That for the future, no <HI>Stranger</HI> coming as a <HI>Preacher</HI> among us, without &s;ufficient A&s;&s;urances of his being what he pretends to be, &s;hall be Employ'd in our <HI>Pulpits,</HI> without a &s;olemn Examinati|on of his <HI>Capacities,</HI> for the Tremendous Work, of Preaching the <HI>Glorious Go&s;pel of God.</HI></Q>
And we earne&s;tly Reque&s;t, the Reve|rend Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, in the &s;everal A&s;&s;ociations and Vicinities throughout the Country, to joyn with us, in &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>We do al&s;o Solemnly Advi&s;e, all our People, to beware of Running after <HI>New Preachers,</HI> of who&s;e Endowments and Principles, they have not had a Rea&s;onable Atte&s;tation; le&s;t they unawares run them&s;elves into &s;hameful and woful Reflections. The Apo&s;tolical Injuncti|ons, <HI>To prove all Things,</HI> does not invite Un|&s;table
<PB N="7" REF="000935_0006_0FAD9232ACD802D0">
people, to <HI>Run after all Preachers,</HI> (as they too often pervert the &s;ence of it,) but it only directs people&punc; to <HI>Examine</HI> by the Word of God, the Doctrine, which they hear, from tho&s;e that in an orderly way are to be heard as their <HI>Teachers.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Preaching of the Go&s;pel,</HI> being that Grand In&s;titution, whereon depends the E|verla&s;ting Salvation of men, Satan &s;eeks it as a mighty Triumph, to pervert it unto their E|verla&s;ting De&s;truction. And a people, that <HI>having Itching Ears, do after their own Lu&s;ts heap up Teachers to them&s;elves,</HI> do mi&s;erably render them&s;elves, obnoxious unto the Im|pre&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e <HI>New Preachers,</HI> that will &s;e|duce them unto <HI>damnable Here&s;ies.</HI> Or, &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>New Preachers,</HI> do broach no <HI>New Errors,</HI> yet if they &s;hall prove <HI>Cheats,</HI> that have made the <HI>Preaching of the Go&s;pel</HI> only a <HI>Cloak,</HI> for their <HI>Covetous,</HI> or <HI>La&s;civious,</HI> or other profane De&s;igns, they that &s;hall have <HI>too &s;uddenly im|proved</HI> tho&s;e men, will be <HI>partakers of their Sins.</HI> And the Glorious Ordinances of God will be likely to fall into a loath&s;ome <HI>Contempt</HI> among the people, if Contemptible Fellows can Ea&s;ily pro&s;titute them unto their pernici|ous purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sermons,</HI> wherein the <HI>Everlasting Go&s;|pel</HI> is <HI>Preached,</HI> as well as the <HI>Prayers</HI> made in our Congregations; are to be Con&s;idered, as
<PB N="8" REF="000935_0007_0FAD9233C7E11318">
a principal part of the <HI>Wor&s;hip of God</HI> among the People of God: they are to Glorify God, &amp; our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with agreeable <HI>Confe&s;&s;ions</HI> of the <HI>Truths</HI> He ha's Revealed unto us; &amp;, as in the <HI>Peace Offering</HI> of old, <HI>God</HI> hath <HI>His</HI> part in them, as well as the People <HI>theirs.</HI> Hence, whether the people that are the Hearers, be many or few, learned or weak, froward or meek, the <HI>Preacher</HI> mu&s;t prepare an <HI>Offering,</HI> as far as he can, Suitable for that God, who is a <HI>Great King and who&s;e Name is Dreadful.</HI> But if E|very piece of Ignorance, and Arrogance, be &s;et up for a <HI>Preacher,</HI> the Name of the Holy God, will be profaned, with an <HI>Offering,</HI> that is made a <HI>Ridicule</HI> in the <HI>Repetition.</HI></P>
<P>We are not un&s;en&s;ible, that one thing, which ha's much Expo&s;ed &s;ome <HI>Injudicious people</HI> among us, is, An opinion that <HI>Illiterate Men,</HI> may be Serviceable and Admirable <HI>Preachers.</HI> Now, ina&s;much as the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> have given this among their In&s;tructions to their Emi&s;&s;aries, <HI>To teach that Learning is needle&s;s in a Mini&s;ter, and if they under&s;tand the Go&s;pel, it is Sufficient,</HI> we are &s;orry that any of our people &s;hould be &s;o <HI>Be&s;otted,</HI> not to &s;ay, <HI>Beje&s;uited.</HI> When the Knowledge of the <HI>Tongues</HI> and <HI>Arts</HI> Revived, <HI>Religion</HI> had a Revival with it: And though &s;ome <HI>Unlearned</HI> men have been u&s;eful to the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Religion,</HI> yet no man ever decried <HI>Learning,</HI> but what was, an Ene|my

<HEAD>An HISTORY, Of Some IMPOSTORS, Remarkably and Sea&s;onably detected, in the Churches of <HI>New England;</HI> Written to maintain the Advice Publi&s;hed by &s;ome of the Pastors in tho&s;e Churches relating to <HI>Impo&s;tures,</HI> and prevent all future Mi&s;chiefs from them.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a notable Di&s;cipline, by which the Reformed Churches in <HI>France,</HI> pre&s;erved them&s;elves, from the Into|lerable Mi&s;chiefs, ari&s;ing by the allow|ance of <HI>Unworthy Preachers:</HI> Their National <HI>Synods</HI> every Time they Sat, would publi&s;h a <HI>Roll</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Unworthy Preachers,</HI> that could be found creeping in among them, and with a de&s;cription of their Feature, and Stature, and other circum&s;tances, like what u&s;es to be given in an <HI>Hue in Cry,</HI> this <HI>Roll</HI> would notify the Crimes laid unto their charge, and admoni&s;h all People to beware of Entertaining them.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="000935_0011_0FAD92A575014660">The Churches of <HI>New England,</HI> have <HI>Here|tofore</HI> been in &s;uch <HI>Good Order,</HI> that no man could be Ordained and Received as a <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> in them, without the Concurrence of the Churches in the Vicinity, and a very &s;olemn and publick Action. But a <HI>Good Order</HI> ha's never yet been provided among us, that no Untryed, and Unfit per&s;on, &s;hall &s;et up for a <HI>Preacher,</HI> and run about from Town to Town, getting into the too much <HI>unguarded Pulpits,</HI> and threatning our Holy Religion, with no little <HI>Inconvenience.</HI> Now to prevent and redre&s;s, this <HI>Inconvenience,</HI> it ha's been by &s;ome Con&s;iderate per&s;ons de&s;ired, That &s;ome|thing like the <HI>French Roll</HI> may be Exhibited unto the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> which may Exemplify &s;ome few of the many <HI>Cheats,</HI> that have gone to Impo&s;e upon them. It is unrea&s;onable to complain, That the <HI>Crimes</HI> of tho&s;e Cheats are thus <HI>openly</HI> Expo&s;ed; for, I be&s;eech you, Sirs, are they not as <HI>openly</HI> Committed?

Our <HI>Laws</HI> not pro|viding &s;uch a puni&s;hment for them, they that would be faithful to the Churches, will do well (for did not the Apo&s;tle as much to <HI>Hy|menaeus,</HI> &amp; <HI>Alexander</HI>?) to &s;et them up in an <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> in&s;tead of a <HI>Pillory,</HI> with a <HI>Writing,</HI> as it were in <HI>Capitals,</HI> to &s;ignifie, THESE WERE IMPOSTORS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTEEMED MINISTERS.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence and Advantage of this Action, 'tis hoped, will be, That both <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> &amp; <HI>People,</HI> will be more wary of being too &s;ud|den, in asking to <HI>Preach</HI> for them, tho&s;e to whom they are utter <HI>Strangers: That</HI> needy and profane <HI>Strangers,</HI> will no more venture to <HI>Preach</HI> in a Country, where their detected Wickedne&s;s will be proclaimed for the <HI>Terror</HI> of all that &s;hall come after them: <HI>That</HI> all pious minds will give glory to the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, who <HI>Walks in the mid&s;t of His Churches,</HI> when they &s;ee what <HI>Quick Work,</HI> He has ordinarily made in the&s;e Churches, to di&s;cover tho&s;e <HI>Athei&s;tical Preachers,</HI> that have &s;o horribly mocked Him: and admire

There the Mon&s;ter &s;et up for a Preacher of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> and putting on a Mighty &s;how of Religion, he was Mightily followed and admired; and the people treat|ed him with a more than ordinary Liberality. Percieving that it was Time to be gone from
<PB N="18" REF="000935_0017_0FAD92A9D2150B28">
thence, he forged Letters of his Fathers Death in <HI>England,</HI> by which a va&s;t E&s;tate was fallen to him; under the umbrage of that Forgery, he gets off immediately by a Ve&s;&s;el, that mu&s;t fir&s;t carry him to <HI>New England.</HI> Having Preached &s;everal Sermons in the Southern parts of <HI>New England,</HI> he comes to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in the year 1698. Where in private Hou&s;es, he would be ridiculou&s;ly forward in thru&s;t|ing him&s;elf upon <HI>Prayer,</HI> which he would manage with a Noi&s;e, that might reach all the Neighbourhood. He began to Court Opportunities of <HI>Preaching</HI> among the Neigh|bours; but forgetting to change his Name, the Gentlewoman to who&s;e Decea&s;ed Hus|band he had been a Servant, accidentally coming in to the Hou&s;e is here he lodged, and hearing one of that Name exceedingly cryed up, as a worthy, able, eminent man, ask'd for a &s;ight of him. When to her A&s;toni&s;hment &s;he found it was <HI>Dick,</HI> even that very Scan|dalous <HI>Dick,</HI> that had plaid for many abomi|nable Pranks in her own Family &s;ome years ago. The Gentlewoman could Scarce be|lieve her Eyes; and finding the Vagrant not give her any intelligent Account how he be|came a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> it was yet more unintelligi|ble to her, how he became a <HI>Mini&s;ter.</HI> He begg'd her Pardon for all his old <HI>Knaveries,</HI> but &s;he being advi&s;ed that he was now practi&s;ing of <HI>New</HI> ones, took a cour&s;e that the

<P>Except the <HI>Churches,</HI> thus acknowledge the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the <HI>Son of God,</HI> they can|not call <HI>God</HI> their <HI>Father,</HI> they cannot propo&s;e to be them&s;elves by <HI>Adoption,</HI> the <HI>Children of God.</HI></P>

<P>Again; We are to <HI>Know,</HI> That all our <HI>Thoughts,</HI> and the very <HI>Thoughts</HI> of all men, are fully <HI>known</HI> unto our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>Yet once more; We are to <HI>know,</HI> That the mo&s;t <HI>Secret Affections</HI> of men are <HI>known</HI> unto the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>Thirdly.

Such <HI>Partners</HI> with <HI>Sinners,</HI> will do well to Tremble before that Word of God, in P&s;al. 28 5. <HI>Becau&s;e they regard not the works of the Lord nor the operation of His Hands, He &s;hall De&s;troy them.</HI> In the mean time the <HI>Churches</HI> of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are to <HI>Take Notice</HI> of what He does in His <HI>Notable Providence.</HI> When our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t

gives us to &s;ee, That He <HI>takes Notice</HI> of His <HI>Churches,</HI> and of what is done among them, it becomes His <HI>Churches</HI> to <HI>take Notice</HI> of His <HI>Providence.</HI> Why, There are <HI>Le&s;&s;ons</HI> of Great Con&s;equence, which the <HI>Churches</HI> are to Learn from that <HI>Providence,</HI> wherein they &s;ee Him <HI>Searching the Reins &amp; Hearts</HI> of men.
