<HEAD>AN EPISTLE IN TRUE LOVE, Containing A Farewel Exhortation To Friends Families.</HEAD>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHO have retained your Inte|grity, Love, and Life in the precious Truth, and are ma|king it your chiefest Interest to exalt the same in the Earth: To all such is my endeared Love, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> blessed Fellowship of Life &amp; Peace, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Almighty God on your Behalf, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">

may stand fast in that Liberty wherewith Christ hath set you free; taking good heed that you be not again entangled with the surfeiting Cares of this uncertain World, lest your Understandings be darkned, and you thereby be uncapable of answering the End for which the Lord raised you up: For although you, who I am at this time drawn forth in <HI>Exhortation</HI> to, may not be con|cerned in a <HI>Doctrinal Testimony;</HI> yet, my dear Friends, you who have known an Over|coming by the Blood of the <HI>Lamb,</HI> and His <HI>Power,</HI> to you it is given, not only to Believe, but to be as Pillars in GOD'S HOUSE. And I must say, That there is a great Work for you to do in this Day of outward Ease; and, were I not pressed in Spirit, in a Sight and Sense I have had of the State of the <HI>Churches,</HI> I should at this time have been silent: But now for the Lord's sake, and the Churches Reformation, I entreat the Faithful, to come up to the help of the Lord, against the Mighty.</P>
<P>IF any enquire, what I have seen in the Light of the Lord, so mightily to obstruct the Prosperity of Truth in the Faith, I do with Sorrow answer, It is the SPIRIT OF THE WORLD, PRIDE, and COVETOUSNESS, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> EASE, with SELF-INTEREST.</P>

AND the way to <HI>Promote,</HI> and, I hope, in the Lord's Time, to <HI>Effect</HI> it to God's Ho|nour, and the Benefit and Enlargement of the Churches, is,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> For the Faithful (who are as Pillars) Fathers, and Mothers in the Church, care|fully to observe the <HI>Operation</HI> of God's Holy Spirit, and thereby you will be enabled to set up an Holy Discipline, in your own Fa|milies; being often <HI>Inward,</HI> attending upon the <HI>Wonderful Counsellor.</HI> So shall you be enlarged, in due time, to gain upon each Church which you belong unto: For, dear Friends, if ever there was need for the Seers to be inward with the Lord, in deep Mourn|ing, the Husbands apart, and their faithful Wives apart, it looks to me to be in our Day. For, Oh! How is the Care and Coun|sel of the Lord, which was convey'd to us thro' our faithful Elders, with respect to Gospel Order, slighted; and thereby a Li|bertine Spirit got up, both in Habit and Conversation: And it is to be feared, that those <HI>Worldly Spirited Ones</HI> rather serve them|selves, than the True and Living GOD.</P>
<P>AND that such may be provoked to re|turn to the LORD with unfeigned Re|pentance, I am at this time concerned, to re|commend the excellent Method which <HI>Joshua,</HI> that brave Captain under the great King of Kings, took, when he had led the Children of
<PB N="4" REF="002434_0004_0FDB52F8A415B778">
<HI>rael</HI> into the Promised Land, and divided un|them their Lots, after he had powerfully and wisely gone in and out before them, until, by the Strength of the Lord, they had fought their Battels, and subdued their Ene|mies, taking Cities from them, till they were grown a Rich and numerous People, and possessed of Vineyards, and Olive-yards rea|dy planted to their Hands: Then this blessed Servant of the Lord, who, no doubt, had a clear Sight of the Danger they were in, of forgetting the Lord, the true and living God, by whose powerful Arm their Fathers were brought out of the House of Bondage, according to his Promise made to his faith|ful Servant <HI>Abraham.</HI> I say, This Wise Leader in Israel commemorates the Mercies, Victories, and wonderful Deliverances of God to them, without the least Ostentation, or desire of Honour, Name, or Fame in the World, or amongst <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in a lively powerful Exhortation, expresseth, himself in these Words:</P>
<P><HI>NOW therefore Fear the Lord, and serve him in Sincerity and Truth, and put away the Gods which your Father, served on the other side the Flood, and in Egypt, and serve ye THE LORD. And if it seem Evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this Day whom you will serve, whether the Gods which your Fathers served, that were on the other side of the Flood; or the Gods of the Amorites, in whose Land ye dwell: But
<PB N="5" REF="002434_0005_0FDB52FE15FEB4F0">
as for ME, and MY HOUSE, We will serve the Lord,</HI> Josh. 24. <HI>ver.</HI> 14, 15.&mdash;But, Ver. 21, 22. <HI>If ye forsake the Lord, and serve strange Gods, then will he turn, and, do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</HI> And the People said unto <HI>Joshua, Nay, but WE</HI> will <HI>serve the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Dear Friends, Observe what Influence this lively Zeal, and Godly Resolution had upon the People; so that there appear'd a <HI>Willing|ness</HI> in them to put away those things which <HI>grieved</HI> the Lord, and hindred them from serving of him fully and freely, saying, <HI>God forbid that WE should forsake the Lord, to serve other Gods.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, my <HI>Dear Friends,</HI> whom God hath blessed with a <HI>large <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of Grace, by the which you have been enabled to make a <HI>good Confession</HI> to his Name and Truth, in <HI>Holiness of Life</HI> in this Land, where my Lot is now fallen, to Travel up and down in the <HI>Love of God</HI> for no other End than that an <HI>In|crease</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Faithfulness</HI> may be known in the Gathered Churches of Christ. In order thereunto, I beseech you look into the <HI>true</HI> State of the Churches, and see if you, with me, cannot behold a <HI>great Declen|sion</HI> from the <HI>Primitive Plainness, Simplicity,</HI> and <HI>Sincerity</HI> which Truth led our faithful Elders into. Oh! the <HI>Testimonies</HI> they have left us, of the Care they had to order their
<PB N="6" REF="002434_0006_0FDB53002B01CFB8">
Conversation in <HI>Words, Habit,</HI> and <HI>Deport|ment,</HI> so as to answer the <HI>Witness of God</HI> in all Men with whom they had to do.</P>
<P>AND now with Sorrow I lay before you, That in my late Travels, I saw too many taking up a <HI>Fleshly Ease,</HI> by letting an <HI>Earthly Carnal Mind</HI> prevail; even to the <HI>neglecting</HI> the <HI>Assembling</HI> themselves together, to <HI>Wait</HI> upon the Lord, and <HI>Worship</HI> him in Spirit and Truth.</P>
<P>THIS I know is the Cause of Grief to you <HI>faithful Elders;</HI> but that you may be blessed with Peace here, and leave a sweet Memorial to after Ages. let it be your Care, in each Church, to <HI>stir up</HI> the <HI>Negligent</HI> to a <HI>lively</HI> Commemoration of the <HI>Mercies</HI> of God; and with <HI>due Care</HI> to use your <HI>Christian Autho|rity,</HI> in the Management and Settlement of your <HI>own Families,</HI> in that <HI>decent Order,</HI> we, through the Mercy and Wisdom of God, have been <HI>Established</HI> in. And for your En|couragement therein, the Lord will be unto you a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> and a <HI>shield,</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> and no <HI>good Thing</HI> will be withold from such, who, in the <HI>Love of God,</HI> diligently <HI>Labour, Hope,</HI> and patiently <HI>Wait</HI> for to see <HI>Sion's Righteousness go forth as Brightness,</HI> and her <HI>Salvation as a Lamp that burneth;</HI> that <HI>the Gentiles may see her Light, and all Kings her Glory.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002434_0007_0FDB53026B868C30">
OH! I have to say, such <HI>sound</HI> Pillars, keeping faithful to the End, shall be crown|ed with <HI>Glory, Honour, Immortality,</HI> and <HI>Eter|nal Happiness</HI> for ever and ever.</P>
<P>AND if I may yield you a little Hand of Help, it is farther in my Heart to leave this <HI>Farewell Exhortation,</HI> to all <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Mothers, Masters</HI> and <HI>Mistresses,</HI> especially of the <HI>Younger</HI> Sort; those who have in any Measure <HI>tasted</HI> of the good Word of Life, and of the Powers of the World to come: That all such be very careful, to walk <HI>wor|thy</HI> of the <HI>Vocation</HI> whereunto they have been called, in <HI>Honesty, Sobriety,</HI> and <HI>true Humility,</HI> having your Minds <HI>girded</HI> with the <HI>Girdle of Truth:</HI> So shall your Conversation answer the <HI>Witness of God</HI> in the Hearts of your <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> and also to such who do not yet profess with us, with whom you may be concerned. For, <HI>Dear Friends,</HI> your <HI>Candles</HI> have not been <HI>lighted</HI> by the Lord, to be put out again, or you to hide the Light thereof from your Families or Neighbour|hood, under a <HI>Bed,</HI> or under a <HI>Bushel.</HI> There|fore I desire you may arise, and <HI>trim</HI> your Lamps, and be <HI>watchful</HI> that your <HI>Lights</HI> may be kept <HI>shining,</HI> and <HI>Lamps burning:</HI> For it is not enough <HI>carelesly</HI> to retain a <HI>Knowledge</HI> of what the Lord hath done in <HI>times past;</HI> but that there be a <HI>daily waiting upon,</HI> and <HI>sup|plicating</HI> the Lord, for the <HI>renewing</HI> of his
<PB N="8" REF="002434_0008_0FDB53042B5E6EA8">
<HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Life,</HI> that thereby you may be kept <HI>alive</HI> to him, and may be a sweet Savour of Life <HI>unto Life</HI> in your Families and Neigh|bourhood: So will the Lord be <HI>glorifyed;</HI> and your Souls, that are thus <HI>renew'd,</HI> keeping <HI>under</HI> the Power of the <HI>holy Cross of Christ,</HI> in the whole <HI>Management</HI> of your <HI>Conversation.</HI> You, I say, shall then enjoy a serene <HI>Quiet,</HI> when the Lord is <HI>pleading</HI> with Backsliders, and the Wicked among the Children of Men.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Friends,</HI> this know, That the Day of the Lord's <HI>sifting</HI> the Churches ha|stens on apace: And my fervent <HI>Labour</HI> is, That all those who make <HI>mention</HI> of the Name of the Lord in this <HI>holy Way,</HI> may so <HI>demean themselves</HI> in <HI>true Self-denial,</HI> as that, when proved by <HI>Divine Wisdom,</HI> they may be found of that <HI>sound Wheat,</HI> that not one Grain of it may be lost.</P>
<P>AND, in order that it may be so, I intreat all, whom the Lord hath <HI>blessed</HI> with <HI>Families,</HI> that they carefully observe the <HI>Appearance of the Grace of God,</HI> in every of its Operations and <HI>Drawings.</HI> And what|soever the Lord thereby concerneth any one to do, let it be done with the <HI>utmost Diligence.</HI> So will <HI>Parents</HI> be <HI>good Examples</HI> to their <HI>Children, Masters</HI> to their <HI>Servants:</HI> For the Heads of Families are, or ought to be, the <HI>Lord's Ministers</HI> under him, ruling their Families <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>Power of Love,</HI> by which
<PB N="9" REF="002434_0009_0FDB530594B0B120">
they have known a being turned from <HI>Dark|ness,</HI> to the <HI>true Light, Christ Jesus:</HI> For surely, it is by this <HI>Power of Love,</HI> that we are enabled to order our Families rightly, both in <HI>Life and Manners.</HI> Therefore I would desire, That all may see to the <HI>dis|charging</HI> of their <HI>Duty</HI> aright, as in the Sight of an all-seeing God.</P>
<P>AND for the <HI>Encouragement</HI> of the Lord's People in this Practice, in the Power and Wisdom of God, I see clearly, and am constrained to leave it behind me, That the Lord requires a Godly Care in Families to be observed amongst his People; and I have seen it to be the only <HI>Expedient</HI> for a <HI>right Reformation,</HI> and <HI>Regulation</HI> in the <HI>Churches:</HI> For let me tell the Backslider, with the <HI>Co|vetous Earthly Minded,</HI> and those who are Lovers of Pleasure more than God, it is high time for such to <HI>Repent,</HI> and do their <HI>first Works,</HI> taking blame to <HI>themselves</HI> for their <HI>Unfaithfulness,</HI> and the <HI>Evil Example</HI> they have been unto their Families; either in <HI>trampling</HI> upon the Testimonies of our Faith|ful Suffering Elders, by <HI>Paying</HI> of TYTHE connivingly or willingly; or any other <HI>Evil</HI> that the <HI>Testimony of Truth</HI> is against: and for the future, <HI>redeem</HI> the Time, by <HI>doubling</HI> their <HI>Diligence,</HI> lest they should have Cause to Repent when it is too late, and then Horrour will be their Portion in a Dying Hour.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="002434_0010_0FDB5308EA700768">
AND this farther I have to leave to the <HI>Unfaithful,</HI> for the clearing of my <HI>Con|science</HI> in the Sight of God; That if his <HI>Love</HI> will not prevail, neither <HI>Immediately,</HI> nor <HI>Instrumentally;</HI> the Lord will be <HI>Clear</HI> when he Judgeth, as he was in the Destru|ction of the <HI>Old World,</HI> together with the Cities of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah;</HI> it having been the way of the Lord, to let those who are afar off, hear what he hath done, in order that they may be <HI>Warned,</HI> that HEARING and FEARING, they may be sa|ved whilst Mercy is offered.</P>
<P>AND that this may be the <HI>Choice</HI> of all, is the sincere Desire of One, who is made willing to <HI>spend</HI> and be <HI>spent</HI> for the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Prosperity</HI> of the <HI>Church;</HI> and that all, who profess to be <HI>Members</HI> thereof, may be so <HI>Taught of the Lord,</HI> that they may come to be <HI>Established</HI> in <HI>Righteousness;</HI> and, by holding out to the <HI>End,</HI> may receive an <HI>Immortal Crown of Glory,</HI> which will never fade away.</P>
<P>THUS as I have in great Tenderness, and for the Ease of my Spirit, left a little <HI>Family exhortation</HI> to my <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Brethren</HI> in this Lord: It now remaineth with me, to leave a <HI>Token</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> to their <HI>tender Chil|dren</HI> in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and elsewhere.</P>

OH! <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Believing Parents,</HI> in whom is <HI>Innocency,</HI> and upon whom the Spots of this <HI>World</HI> have not yet prevailed: My love in Christ is great to you; belie|ving assuredly, that the <HI>Call</HI> of the Lord is unto you, that you may be of <HI>his Heritage</HI> and Sanctuary, in order to place his <HI>Name</HI> in the midst of you: For YOU hath he chosen, above all the <HI>Families</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI> to shew forth his <HI>Praise,</HI> and <HI>declare</HI> his <HI>Won|derful Works</HI> to the Children of Men: There|fore my Desire is, that none may <HI>frustrate</HI> the Lord in his <HI>gracious Intention;</HI> but that his <HI>glorious Work</HI> may be carried on, both in <HI>particular,</HI> and in the <HI>general,</HI> to his <HI>Praise</HI> and the Churches <HI>Comfort.</HI> That it may be so, I desire you to take the following Ex|hortation.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> AS you grow up to Years of <HI>Un|derstanding,</HI> so as to know Good from Evil be sure you <HI>chuse</HI> the Good, and <HI>refuse</HI> the E|vil: And if at any time you should <HI>transgress</HI> your <HI>Parents, Masters</HI> or <HI>Mistresses Commands</HI> before you cover it not with a QUIBBLE, or LYE; For although you ought not by <HI>any Means</HI> to <HI>disobey</HI> your <HI>Parents,</HI> yet if any, so want of <HI>due Care,</HI> at any time, should; I may be the <HI>Fault</HI> committed, may be no great Sin in the Sight of God; but if cover'd with a WILFUL LYE, a grievous Sin is committed for which you must know <HI>Sorrow,</HI> if <HI>Favour</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> come to witness.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002434_0012_0FDB530B66B8C7E0">
THEREFORE, <HI>Dear Hearts, Fear</HI> God <HI>a doing</HI> and <HI>speaking Truth</HI> in all things; for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> once way be given to <HI>Lying,</HI> and an Habit of it got into, such lose the <HI>Favour</HI> of God, and <HI>forfeit</HI> their <HI>Credit</HI> with good Men.</P>
<P>THE next <HI>Evil</HI> I have to warn the <HI>Youth</HI> of, is, To beware of an <HI>high proud Mind,</HI> from whence <HI>Desires</HI> after the Glory of this <HI>World</HI> do proceed, which bring in a Train of <HI>unnecessary Cares</HI> and <HI>Troubles:</HI> So that it may easily be seen, the <HI>proud Man</HI> and <HI>Woman</HI> never want <HI>Misery,</HI> because they seldom have a <HI>settled quiet Content;</HI> and the chief Reason is, They go far from God, the alone <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>true Con|tent: For,</HI> as saith the Scripture, <HI>the Lord beholdeth the proud afar off:</HI> And that Man or Woman, who grows <HI>big</HI> with <HI>Conceit</HI> of themselves, can scarcely satisfy their <HI>Eyes</HI> with seeing, nor their <HI>Appetites</HI> with craving. Hence it follows, <HI>What shall I Eat? What shall I drink? Wherewithal shall I deck and a|dorn my self?</HI> Nay, saith the <HI>incessant Seeker</HI> after the <HI>Fashions,</HI> of this World, <HI>Which is the newest Fashion, Cut or Dress?</HI> All this is but <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Vexation of Spirit.</HI> I take these to be like those the Prophet spoke of, when he speaks complaining of <HI>Israel,</HI> saying, <HI>Israel is an empty Vine, he bringeth forth Fruit unto him|self.</HI> Oh you Children of <HI>Believers!</HI> that you may not be of this Number, neither seek <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> come up in Imitation of those, who
<PB N="13" REF="002434_0013_0FDB530CE79BD4E0">
follow the <HI>foolish Fashions</HI> of this World, lest you grieve God and your tender Parents, whose <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Zeal</HI> for the <HI>Truth,</HI> cannot admit of any such <HI>sinful Liberty:</HI> Therefore I beseech you, let your <HI>Conversation</HI> be with|out coveting those things: And do not seek to prove the <HI>Patience</HI> of your <HI>tender Parents,</HI> by your <HI>Mumuring</HI> and <HI>Reasoning,</HI> by bring|ing Examples on this wise, <HI>Such Friends Children have their Cloaths made after this Fa|shion or the other:</HI> Urging your <HI>Parents</HI> by your <HI>Reasoning,</HI> for that which hath no <HI>Rea|son in it;</HI> to wit, <HI>PRIDE,</HI> giving them no Rest until you have <HI>obtained</HI> your <HI>Ends.</HI> Oh! Let such <HI>fear</HI> in time, for those things border near upon <HI>wilful Disobedience;</HI> and it is to be feared, the next Step those will take, will be into the wide World of Wick|edness.</P>
<P>THEREFORE I entreat <HI>Young People,</HI> who have in any Measure been <HI>guilty</HI> of the above-mention'd <HI>Evils,</HI> be <HI>humbled</HI> before the Lord, strip your selves of all your <HI>vain At|tire,</HI> Repent that ever you gave Way to the Reins of your <HI>vain Minds,</HI> to be drawn out after the Glory of this World.</P>
<P>THERE is also another <HI>dangerous Snare,</HI> which the Enemy seeks to catch <HI>Young People</HI> in, that is, <HI>The Fellowship</HI> and <HI>Friend|ship</HI> of those, who do not profess with us; by which some of our <HI>Youth,</HI> in giving way
<PB N="14" REF="002434_0014_0FDB531150338988">
to frequent Walking and Conversation with them, have been <HI>captivated</HI> into <HI>unequal Mar|riages by Priests,</HI> who, with Sorrow it may be spoken, mind their <HI>Gain</HI> more than the Happiness of the Youth they thus couple together: For <HI>Ministers for God</HI> ought to give every Parent their <HI>Right,</HI> in <HI>disposing</HI> of their Children: The want of which hath brought many a hoary Head with Sorrow to the Grave; as also occasioned many a <HI>distracted languishing Family</HI> in the <HI>Protestant Nations.</HI> And I must say to all such who have been privy to such <HI>hidden theivish Matches,</HI> I do not see how they can Answer it to <HI>Almighty God,</HI> or to such <HI>wronged Parents.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, dear Friends, Be warned, take the Apostle's Advice, <HI>Be not unequally yoaked, a Believer with an Unbeliever,</HI> 2 Cor. 6. 14, Such Doings, though they may be sweet in the <HI>Tast,</HI> yet we have seen it bitter in the <HI>going down,</HI><ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That those, who, for want of <HI>Watchfulness,</HI> have been prevailed upon to an <HI>unequal Yoaking,</HI> afterwards coming to a Sight of their <HI>Youthful Folly,</HI> and having Children, how <HI>bitter</HI> hath it been to such Parents, when they could not have them brought up in that Faith where they believe <HI>Salvation</HI> is most surely to be obtained: The <HI>strife</HI> that hath thereupon followed, hath many times caused great <HI>Distraction</HI> between Husband and Wife, betwixt whom nothing should be but LOVE.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="002434_0015_0FDB5313A3D8C5E8">
AND that all <HI>Young People may</HI> be pre|served, out of this, and all other <HI>Evils,</HI> shun had Company as infectious both to Soul and Body, and let your spare Hours be spent in <HI>Religious Company,</HI> or <HI>Retirement,</HI> reading or meditating on <HI>Heavenly Subjects;</HI> of which you are blessed with Variety.
