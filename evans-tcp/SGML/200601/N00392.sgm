<P><HI>THe old Heresy of the sensual</HI> Sadducees, <HI>denying the Being of Angels either good or evil died not with them, nor</HI> will <HI>it, whiles men (abandoning both Faith &amp; Reason) count it their wisdom to credit nothing but what they see &amp; feel. How much this fond opinion has gotten ground in this debauched Age is aw|fully observable; and what a dangerous streak it gives to settle men in Atheism, is not hard to discern. God is therefore pleased (besides the witness born to the Truth in Sacred Writ) to suffer</HI> Devils <HI>sometimes to do such things in the world as shall stop the mouth of gain say|ers, and extor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Confession from them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It has also been made a doubt by some, whether there are any such things as</HI> Witches, <HI>i. e.</HI> Such as by Contract or Explicit Covenant with the Devil, improve, or rather are improv<HI>ed</HI> by him to the doing of things strange in themselves, and besides their natural Course. <HI>But (besides that the</HI> Word of God <HI>assures us that there have been such, and given order about them) no Age passes without some apparent</HI> Demonstration <HI>of it. For, Though it be Folly to impute every dubious Accident, or unwonted Effect of Providence, to</HI> Witchcraft; <HI>yet there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> some <HI>things which cannot be excepted a|gainst, but must be ascribed</HI> hither.</P>
<P>Angels <HI>&amp;</HI> Men <HI>not being made for civil Converse together in this world; and all</HI> Communion <HI>with</HI> Devils <HI>being interdicted us; their Nature also be|ing</HI> spiritual, <HI>and the Word of God having said so little in that particular concerning their way of</HI> Act|ing;
<PB REF="000486_0006_0FA671425DE51F38">
<HI>hence it is that we can disclose but a</HI> little <HI>of those</HI> Mysteries of Darkness; <HI>all reports that are from</HI> themselves, <HI>or</HI> their Instruments, <HI>being to be esteemed as</HI> Illusions, <HI>or at least covered with</HI> De|ceit, <HI>filled with the Impostures of the</HI> Father of Lies; <HI>and the effects which come under our consideration be|ing</HI> Mysterious, <HI>rather</HI> Posing <HI>than</HI> Informing <HI>us.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Among the many Instances that have been of this kind,</HI> That <HI>which is Recorded in this</HI> Narrative, <HI>is worthy to be commended to the Notice of Mankind, it being a thing in it self full of Memorable passages,</HI> a<HI>nd</HI> faithfully <HI>recorded, acording to the Truth in Matrer of Fact, scarce any Instance being asserted in it, but what hath the Evidence of</HI> many credible Witnesses, <HI>did need require.

<P><HI>Section</HI> I.

SECT. II. The four Children (where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the <HI>Eldest</HI> was about Thirteen, and the <HI>young<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> was perhaps about a third part so many years of age) had enjoy'd a Religious Education, and <HI>answered</HI> it with a very towardly Ingenuity. They had an observable Affection unto <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Sacred</HI> things; and those of them that went capable of it, seem'd to have such a Resentment of their <HI>eternal</HI> Concernments as is not altoge|ther usual. Their Parents also kept them to continual Employment, which did <HI>more</HI> than de|liver them from the Temptations of <HI>Idleness,</HI> and as young as they were, they took a delight in it, it may be <HI>as much</HI> as they should have done. In a word, Such was the whole <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Car|riage</HI> of the Children, that there cannot easily be any thing more unreasonable, than to i|magine that a <HI>Design to Dissemble</HI> could cause them to fall into any of their odd Fits; though there should not have happened, as there <HI>did,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thousand Things, wherein it was perfectly im|possible for any <HI>Dissimulation</HI> of theirs to produce what scores of spectators were amazed at.</P>
<P>SECT. III.

<HI>laundress</HI> was the Daughter of an ignorant and scandalous old Woman in the Neighbourhood; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hose miserable Husband before he died, had sometimes complained of her, that she was un|doubtedly a <HI>Witch,</HI> and that whenever his Head was laid, she would quickly arrive unto the pu|nishments due to such an one.

<P>SECT. IV. It was not long before <HI>one</HI> of her Sisters, and <HI>two</HI> of her Brothers, were seiz|ed, in Order one after another, with <HI>Affects</HI> like those that molested <HI>her.</HI> Within a few weeks they were all <HI>four</HI> tortured every where in a man|ner so very grievous, that it would have broke an heart of stone to have seen their Agonies. Skilful Physicians were consulted for their Help, and particularly our worthy and prudent Friend Dr. <HI>Thomas Oakes,</HI> who found himself so af|fronted by the Distempers of the children, that he concluded nothing but an hellish <HI>Witchcraft</HI> could be the Original of these Maladies. And that which yet more confirmed such Apprehensi|on was, That for one good while, the children were tormented just in the <HI>same part</HI> of their bo|dies
<PB N="4" REF="000486_0014_0FA6715022812528">
all at the <HI>same time</HI> together; and tho they saw and heard not one anothers complaints, tho likewise their pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and sprains were swift like Lightening, yet when (suppose) the <HI>Neck,</HI> or the <HI>Hand,</HI> or the <HI>Back</HI> of <HI>one</HI> was Rack't, so it was at that instant with t' <HI>other</HI> too.</P>
<P>SECT. V. The variety of their tortures increased continually; and tho about Nine or Ten at Night they alwaies had a Release from their miseries, and <HI>ate</HI> &amp; <HI>slept</HI> all night for the most p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> indifferently well, yet in the <HI>day</HI> time they were handled with so many <HI>sorts</HI> of Ails, that it would require of us almost as much time to <HI>Relate</HI> them all, as it did of them to <HI>En|dure</HI> them. Sometimes they would be <HI>Deaf,</HI> sometimes <HI>Dumb,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Blind,</HI> and of|ten, <HI>all this</HI> at once. One while their <HI>Tongues</HI> would be drawn down their Throats; another|while they would be pull'd out upon their <HI>Chins,</HI> to a prodigious length. They would have their <HI>Mouths</HI> opened unto such a Wideness, that their <HI>Jaws</HI> went out of joint; and anon they would clap together again with a Force like that of a strong <HI>Spring-Lock.</HI> The same would happen to their <HI>Shoulder-Blades,</HI> and their <HI>Elbows,</HI> and <HI>Hand-wrists,</HI> and several of their joints. They would at times ly in a benummed condition; and be drawn together as those that are ty'd <HI>Neck &amp; Heels;</HI> and presently be <HI>stretched out,</HI> yea, drawn <HI>Backwards</HI> to such a degree that it was fear'd the
<PB N="5" REF="000486_0015_0FA67152620AA920">
very skin of their Bellies would have crack'd. They would make most pitteous out-cries, that they were cut with <HI>Knives,</HI> and struck with <HI>Blows</HI> that they could not bear. Their <HI>Necks</HI> would be broken, so that their <HI>Neck-bone</HI> would seem dissolved unto them that felt after it; and yet on the sudden, it would become again so <HI>stiff</HI> that there was no stirring of their <HI>Heads;</HI> yea, their Heads would be twisted almost <HI>round;</HI> and if main force at any time obstructed a dangerous motion which they seem'd to be upon, they would roar exceedingly.

<P>She had once a great mind to have eaten a <HI>roast|ed Apple,</HI> but <HI>whenever</HI> she attempted to <HI>eat</HI> it, her <HI>Teeth would be sett,</HI> and sometimes, if she went to take it up, her <HI>Arm would be made so stiff,</HI> that she could not possibly bring her hand to her <HI>Mouth:</HI> at last she said, <HI>Now They say, I shall eat it, if I eat it quickly;</HI> and she nimbly eat it all up.

<P>There was one very singular passion that fre|quently attended her. An <HI>Invisible Chain</HI> would be clapt about her, and shee, in much pain and Fear, cry out, When [<HI>They</HI>] began to

Her <HI>Eyes</HI> were not brought to be perpendicular to her feet, when she rose out of her Seat, as the Mechanism of a Humane Body requires in them that rise, but she was one dragg'd <HI>wholly by other Hands:</HI> and once, When I gave a stamp on the Hearth, just between her and-the Fire, she scream'd out, (tho I think she <HI>saw</HI> me <HI>not</HI>) <HI>that I Jarr'd the Chain, and hurt her Back.</HI></P>

<P>Once being very merrily talking by a Table that had this <HI>last Book</HI> upon it, she just opened the Book, and <HI>was immediately struck backwards</HI> as dead upon the floor.

<P>SECT. <HI>XXVI.</HI> Within a day or <HI>two</HI> after the <HI>Fast,</HI> the young Woman had two remarka|ble Attempts made upon her, by her invisible Adversaries. Once, <HI>they were Dragging her in to the Oven that was then heating,</HI> while there was none in the Room to help her. She clap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t her hands on the <HI>Mantle-tree</HI> to save her self; but they were beaten off; and she had been burned, if at her Out-cryes one had not come in from a|broad for her Relief. Another time, <HI>they</HI> putt an unseen <HI>Rope</HI> with a cruel <HI>Noose</HI> about her Neck, Whereby she was choaked, until she was black in the Face; and though it was taken off before it had kill'd her, yet there were the red Marks of <HI>it,</HI> and of a <HI>Finger</HI> &amp; a <HI>Thumb</HI> near <HI>it,</HI> remaining to be seen for a while afterwards.</P>
<P>SECT. <HI>XXVII.</HI> This was the last Molest|ation that <HI>they</HI> gave her for a While; and she dwelt at my house the rest of the Winter, hav|ing by an obliging and vertuous Conversation, made herself enough Welcome to the Family. But within about a Fortnight, she was visited with <HI>two dayes</HI> of as Extraordinary Obsessions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> any we had been the Spectators of.

convenient for me to entertain my Congregati|on with a <HI>Sermon</HI> upon the <HI>memorable Providences</HI> which these Children had been concerned in.

She would knock at my Study <HI>Door,</HI> affirming, <HI>That some below would be glad to see me;</HI> when there was none that ask't for me. She would call to me with multiply|ed Impertinencies, and throw small things at me wherewith she could not give me any hurt. Shee'd Hector me at a strange rate for the <HI>work</HI> I was at, and threaten me with <HI>I know not what</HI> mischief for it. She got a <HI>History</HI> that I had Written of this <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> and tho she had be|fore this, readd it over and over, yet now she could not read (I believe) one entire Sen|tence of it; but she made of it the most ridicu|lous <HI>Travesty</HI> in the World, with such a Patness and excess of Fancy, to supply the sense that she put upon it, as I was amazed at. And she par|ticularly told me, That <HI>I should quickly come to dis|grace by that History.</HI></P>

SECT. <HI>XXVIII.</HI> But there were many other Wonders behold by us before these two dayes were out. Few <HI>tortures</HI> attended her, but such as were <HI>provoked;</HI> her <HI>Frolicks</HI> being the things that had most possession of her. I was in <HI>Latin</HI> telling some young Gentlemen of the <HI>Col|ledge,</HI> That if I should bid her <HI>Look</HI> to God, her <HI>Eyes</HI> would be put out, upon <HI>which</HI> her eyes were presently served so.

We continually found, that if an <HI>English Bible</HI> were in any part of the <HI>Room</HI> seriously look'd into, though she <HI>saw</HI> and <HI>heard</HI> nothing of it, she would immediately be in very dismal <HI>Agonies.</HI> We now made a Tryal more than once or twice, of the <HI>Greek</HI> New-Testament and the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> Old Testament; and We still found, That if one should go to read in it never so secretly and silently, it would procure her that Anguish, Which there was no enduring of&punc; But, I thought, at length, I fell upon one <HI>infi|rior</HI> Language which the <HI>Doemons</HI> did not seem, <HI>so well</HI> to understand.</P>

Shee'd also fetch very terrible <HI>Blowes</HI> with her Fist, and <HI>Kicks</HI> with her Foot at the man that prayed; but still (for he had bid that none should hinder her) her <HI>Fist</HI> and <HI>Foot</HI> would alwaies recoil, when they came within a few hairs breadths of him just as if Rebounding

Once lying thus, as he that was praying, was alluding to the words of the <HI>Canaanitess,</HI> and saying, <HI>Lord, have mercy on a Daughter vexed with a Davil;</HI> there came a <HI>big,</HI> but <HI>low</HI> voice from her, say|ing, <HI>There's Two or Three of them</HI> (or <HI>us!</HI>) and the standers-by, were under that Apprehension, as that they cannot relate whether her <HI>mouth mov'd</HI> in speaking of it. When Prayer was end|ed, she would Revive in a minute or two, and continue as Frolick some as before.

<P><HI>The Devil is a potent, a cruel, and a restless Ad|versary to the souls of men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> 1. There is a Combination of <HI>Devils</HI> which our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is fill'd withal. A <HI>Devil</HI> is a <HI>spi|ritual</HI> and a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Substance, full of all <HI>Wick|edness,</HI> confined by God unto our <HI>Air</HI> as his <HI>Gao<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> for his Apostasy from the Company &amp; Employ|ment of the <HI>only Angels.</HI> His Title is that in <HI>Eph</HI> 6. 12. a <HI>spiritual wickedness;</HI> that is a <HI>wicked spi|rit.</HI> A <HI>Devil</HI> was once an <HI>Angel,</HI> but Sin has brought him to be a <HI>Father</HI> Angel; an Angel full of Enmity to God and man; an <HI>Angel</HI> made a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> within the <HI>Atmosph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e</HI> of the Earth which we tread upon</P>
<P>The <HI>Scriptures</HI> of Truth allow us these Con|clusions about the <HI>Devils</HI> of He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>We may first conclude, That the Devils are not meer <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> or <HI>Qualities</HI> or <HI>Distempers,</HI> as has been by some absurdly enough conceived. The fond <HI> Saddu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> derides <HI>the Doctrine of Devils,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="000486_0088_0FA671C95A955028">
which we all embrace. But I pray, What things were those that <HI>left their first estate,</HI> being now <HI>reserved in chains of darkness to the judgment of the great day?</HI> What things be those that be|sought our Lord for liberty to <HI>enter into the swine?</HI> But we have among our selves lately seen plain Demonstrations, That there are <HI>Spirits,</HI> which <HI>understand,</HI> and <HI>argue,</HI> and <HI>will;</HI> and which are the enemies of all that is <HI>holy,</HI> and <HI>just,</HI> &amp; <HI>Good.</HI></P>
<P>We may, Secondly Conclude, That these <HI>De|vils</HI> are an <HI>Army</HI> in our <HI>Air.</HI> They are called in <HI>Eph.</HI> 2 2. <HI>the power</HI> (or the Army) <HI>of the air.</HI> There are diverse Miles of <HI>Air</HI> encompassing of this Terraqueous <HI>Globe;</HI> to that <HI>space</HI> it is that the <HI>Devils</HI> are limited, since their <HI>High-Treason</HI> against the God that made them. Here it is that they have a <HI>Play-house,</HI> as well as a <HI>Prison;</HI> here they play all their <HI>devillish Pranks</HI> until the <HI>ever|lasting Fire</HI> shall begin to flame. Indeed, <HI>some</HI> Devils may keep more constantly to <HI>one</HI> countrey, and some to <HI>another.</HI> Hence we read of some in <HI>Marc.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 10. <HI>They besought our Lord much, that He would not send them away out of the Countrey.</HI> But still the <HI>High-places</HI> of our <HI>air</HI> be the Receptacles of all the <HI>wicked Spirits.</HI></P>
<P>We may conclude, Thirdly, That these <HI>Devils</HI> are an <HI>Army</HI> under a <HI>Leader</HI> too. There is a <HI>Government,</HI> a <HI>Monarchy</HI> in the dark Regions; and hence in <HI>Matth.</HI> 12. 24. we read about <HI>Belzebub, the</HI> Prince <HI>of devils.</HI> There you have

the Name of the <HI>Grand-Segniour</HI> who is <HI>King over the children of pride.</HI> Probably, the <HI>Devils</HI> in their first <HI>Conspiracy</HI> and <HI>Rebellion</HI> against God, had a notorious <HI>Ring-Leader;</HI> there was one of greater dignity and influence than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">est, by whom they were <HI>headed;</HI> and they are all now under his Command. We have Mention in the Sacred Oracles, of, <HI>the devil and his angels.</HI> This <HI>cheef devil</HI> is called by way of eminency, <HI>the</HI> De|vil; but he has innumerable <HI>Slaves,</HI> and <HI>Officers,</HI> and <HI>Emissaries,</HI> which are under an entire Subjec|tion to him. His Orders they all observe; and therefore, when we speak of <HI>the Devil,</HI> it in|cludeth each private <HI>Souldier</HI> as well as him that is <HI>principal Commander.</HI> We say, <HI>The Devil,</HI> as we say, <HI>The Turk,</HI> or <HI>The Spaniard;</HI> it means <HI>any</HI> or <HI>every</HI> part of that infernal <HI>Ren|dezvous.</HI> As itis said in <HI>Ps.</HI> 34. 6. <HI>The Angel of the Lord encamps, i. e.</HI> the Whole Host of Angels are as <HI>One</HI> in it.</P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> II The <HI>Divels</HI> are the <HI>great Adversa|ries</HI> of humane <HI>Souls.</HI> Tis here said about the <HI>devil,</HI> He is <HI>your</HI> Adversary; or as the Article in|timates, he is <HI>that</HI> your Adversary.</P>
<P>If it be asked, <HI>How</HI> the Devils are our Ad|versaries? In general they labour to do us all the mischief they can <HI>devise.</HI> They pursue our Hurt in all <HI>waie,</HI> and by all <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> Yet in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> sense they <HI>cannot</HI> come at us unless <HI>according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> Know, That the Greek word here notes

properly an <HI>Adversary at Law;</HI> tis a <HI>law-Ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> that is used here. Thus First, the Devils are our Adversaries as <HI>Accusers.</HI> Tis the Character of the Devil in <HI>Rev.</HI> 12. 10. <HI>The</HI> Accuser <HI>of our Brethren, which</HI> accuseth <HI>them before God, day and night.</HI> He is called a <HI>Satan,</HI> and a D<HI>evil</HI> for this very Cause. The Devils are first our <HI>Tempters,</HI> and then our <HI>Accusers.</HI> They complain to God against us, that we do not <HI>fear</HI> Him, that we do not <HI>love</HI> Him, that we do not <HI>seek</HI> Him, as we ought to do: they represent our faults before the Lord, as things that make us unfit for any Mercy at His hands. There is a <HI>Court</HI> kept some|where in the <HI>Invisible world,</HI> at which Devils endeavour to prefer as many <HI>Complaints</HI> as they they <HI>can</HI> against us. They first <HI>gett</HI> and then <HI>bring</HI> matters of Accusation which we might be <HI>Indicted</HI> and <HI>Condemned</HI> for.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Devils are our Adversaries as <HI>Destroyers.</HI> They <HI>plead</HI> and <HI>pray</HI> as so many <HI>At|tourneys,</HI> that a <HI>Judgment</HI> may be granted against us all; and then they petition that <HI>they</HI> too may be the <HI>Executioners</HI> of it. Tis illustrated in <HI>Job.</HI> 1. 11. and 2. 5. <HI>Satan</HI> urges upon God against <HI>Job, put forth thine hand now, and touch his bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and his flesh.</HI> They would fain have all manner of Miseries to be inflicted on us; and they try all they can to gain <HI>Opportunities</HI> for doing <HI>their</HI> part that we may be miserable. A D<HI>evil</HI> is called a <HI>destroying Angel.</HI> They are D<HI>evils</HI> usually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="6" REF="000486_0091_0FA671D277D486B8">
are the Instruments of Divine Vengeance on the world. If it be asked, <HI>Why</HI> the devils are our Adversaries? There is a double Reason to be Assigned of it. One Reason of it is,</P>
<P>Their <HI>Hatred of God.</HI> The Devils have sha|ken off the <HI>Law,</HI> and the <HI>Rule</HI> of God; and they cannot bear that the <HI>Name</HI> of God should be ac|knowledged in the world. <HI>GOD</HI> and the <HI>De|vils</HI> are sworn enemies to each other; and the Lord may say of them as in <HI>Zeh.</HI> 11. 8. <HI>My soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me.</HI> Now the poor Children of men, both do the <HI>Service</HI> of God, and have the <HI>Image</HI> of God. We do the <HI>Service</HI> of God&punc; Man is the <HI>Priest</HI> of the whole <HI>visible Creation.</HI> Tis by our <HI>Thoughts,</HI> tis by our <HI>Words,</HI> that all things else pay their Homage un|the Lord. The <HI>Devil,</HI> that would be in the <HI>Throne</HI> of God, would ruine us, that God may no more have the <HI>Honour</HI> of a <HI>Father,</HI> or the <HI>Fear</HI> of a <HI>Master</HI> in the world. We also have the <HI>I|mage</HI> of God. In our <HI>Nature</HI> there is <HI>much,</HI> in our <HI>Vertue</HI> there is <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re</HI> of God's Likeness. The Devil is a <HI>Tigre;</HI> they report of that wild beast, it will tear the <HI>picture</HI> of a man, when it cannot reach the <HI>person</HI> of a man: There is a <HI>lively shadow</HI> as it were, of God, upon us; and this the Tigres of <HI>Hell</HI> cannot endure.</P>
<P>A Second Reason of it is, their <HI>Envy</HI> at <HI>Man.</HI> The <HI>Devils</HI> behold <HI>Man</HI> exalted &amp; advanced a|bove themselves. Tis said of the <HI>Leviathan</HI> in
<PB N="7" REF="000486_0092_0FA671D319C605C0">
<HI>Job</HI> 41. 34. <HI>He beholdeth all high things.</HI> Tis ful|filled in the <HI>Pope</HI> also, and lastly in the <HI>Devil.</HI> He cannot brook it, that any should be <HI>higher</HI> than himself. The Apostle intimates, that <HI>Pride</HI> was at first, <HI>the Condemnation of the Devil.</HI> Tis con|jectured, that the Devil being informed of God's decree to have a <HI>Man</HI> subsist in the Second Per|son of the <HI>Trinity;</HI> this provoked him and his Accomplices to their Disobedience. However the Devil now sees <HI>Man Saved</HI> and <HI>himself dam|ned; Man</HI> in the Bosom of God, and <HI>himself</HI> is the Bottom of <HI>Hell; Well</HI> now thinks he, <HI>I will do this</HI> Man <HI>all the spits I can.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> III. <HI>The</HI> Devils <HI>are</HI> potent <HI>Adversa|ries of our Souls.</HI></P>
<P>The Devil is a <HI>Lion,</HI> and as it was said in <HI>Judg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">4. 18. <HI>What is stronger than a Lion?</HI> He has a <HI>Power,</HI> an <HI>Interest,</HI> that may make us all to trem|ble at his Roaring. Hence we read in <HI>Luc.</HI> 10. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">9. about <HI>The power of the enemy:</HI> and he is com|pared in <HI>Cap.</HI> 11. 21. unto, <HI>A strong Armed man.</HI></P>
<P>There be <HI>three</HI> things that show the power of our Adversaries.</P>
<P>First, The power of our Adversaries the De|vils, lies in the <HI>Nature</HI> of them. Tis said in <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 12. <HI>We fight not against flesh &amp; blood</HI> only <HI>but against principalities, and Powers, and spiritual wickednesses.</HI> They are <HI>spiritual,</HI> and therefore <HI>powerful.</HI> The <HI>Spirituality</HI> of the <HI>Devils</HI> enables them&punc; to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> us when we can't <HI>see</HI> them; I
<PB N="8" REF="000486_0093_0FA671D3DEF2F940">
makes 'em ready to attack us and surprise us at unspeakable Disadvantages. The <HI>Divels</HI> are <HI>Spi|rits,</HI> and hence they count <HI>Iron but straw, &amp; bras<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as rotten wood;</HI> they are <HI>Spirits,</HI> and so they <HI>excel in strength;</HI> when they seem afraid of little <HI>Spels</HI> and <HI>Charms,</HI> it is only a stratagem by which they seek to decoy us into their dreadful <HI>Power</HI> more than before. <HI>One</HI> of them let loose, perhaps could <HI>slaughter</HI> an Army of an hundred thousand in a night.</P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Power</HI> of our Adversaries the <HI>De|vils,</HI> lies in the <HI>Number</HI> of them. Even such little things as <HI>Mice,</HI> yea, and <HI>Lice</HI> have prov'd horri|ble plagues by becoming numerous. What then may the <HI>Devils</HI> be, whose Troops amount unto many <HI>Legions!</HI> How many <HI>devils</HI> can sometimes be spared, for the Vexation of <HI>one man!</HI> In the bowels of one afflicted child, I have heard that murmur made, <HI>There are two or three of us!</HI> Yea, we read in <HI>Luc.</HI> 8. 30. of a <HI>Le|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ion</HI> that kept a <HI>Garrison</HI> in one single person a <HI>a Legion</HI> contain'd twelve <HI>Thousand</HI> and five <HI>Hun|dred</HI> in it. Doubtless, there are far more <HI>Devils</HI> than there are <HI>Men</HI> in the world. They <HI>swarm</HI> like the Frogs of <HI>Egypt</HI> in every chamber of our houses. We can go, we can stir no where, but those wild <HI>Arabians</HI> will be upon us.</P>
<P>Thirdly. The <HI>Power</HI> of our Adversaries the <HI>Devils</HI> lies in their <HI>Conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ederacies.</HI> The <HI>Devils</HI> are <HI>all</HI> as <HI>one</HI> among themselves; their Unity
<PB N="9" REF="000486_0094_0FA671D4E5EDF600">
their <HI>Agrement</HI> in their designs makes them for|midable. We are told in Mat. 12. 26. <HI>Satan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not divided against himself.</HI> But more than so The <HI>divels</HI> have of their party among <HI>our selves,</HI> yea, <HI>within</HI> our selves. Devils have <HI>Men</HI> on their side. All wicked <HI>men</HI> promote the ends of the <HI>devils.</HI> Tis said, <HI>The lusts of the</HI> devil <HI>they will do</HI> 'tis said. <HI>The divel works in the Children of disobe|dience.</HI> And the Devils have <HI>Hearts</HI> on their side Our wicked <HI>hearts</HI> will favour and humour the <HI>devils</HI> in their attempts, and betray us into their hands. When they made their assault on our Savionr, tis said, <HI>They sound nothing in Him.</HI> But they find <HI>something</HI> in <HI>us,</HI> they find in us, an <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|mate</HI> by whose <HI>Treachery</HI> we become their <HI>prey</HI> This is the <HI>Power of the Enemy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> IV. The <HI>devils</HI> are also <HI>cruel</HI> Adversa|ries of our souls. The Divel is not only a <HI>Lion</HI> but a <HI>roaring,</HI> an hungry, an <HI>angry</HI> Lion. Yea according to that in <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 2. he is not only <HI>Lion,</HI> but a D<HI>ragon</HI> too. He will have no more mercy than a Lion, he will have no more mercy than a D<HI>ragon</HI> upon all that comes in the way of his cruel Clutches. 'Twas the description of the <HI>Chaldaans</HI> in Hab. 1. 6. <HI>That bitter and hast nation.</HI> To the <HI>devils</HI> does it much more belong they are a <HI>Bitter and a cruel nation.</HI> Never was there such a merciless and a pittiless <HI>Tyrant</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>devil</HI> is; nothing so much pleases that bloody monster, as the <HI>pain</HI> and the <HI>death</HI> of our unhap|py
<PB N="10" REF="000486_0095_0FA671D576066DD8">
souls; and he has no Masick like the <HI>groans of a deadly wounded man.</HI> What a Prodigy of Cruelty was that <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour, who wished that <HI>all his people had but one neck, that he might cut it off at a blow!</HI> Why the <HI>cruel Devil</HI> not only <HI>wished,</HI> but in Paradise he <HI>had</HI> &amp; he <HI>did</HI> such an horrid thing. And it is he that inspires vile men with all the <HI>Cruelty</HI> that their <HI>Inquisitions,</HI> and their <HI>Tortures</HI> give exemple of.</P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> V. The Devils are likewise <HI>Restless</HI> Ad|versaries of our souls. They <HI>go about,</HI> they are always in <HI>Action,</HI> always in <HI>Motion,</HI> that they may undo the souls of men.</P>
<P>The Devil <HI>goes about.</HI> So could he say of himself, in Job, 1. 7. <HI>I come from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</HI> This Prince goes in <HI>Progress,</HI> rides the <HI>Circuit</HI> thro his whole Dominions to see how his work is carried on. And all that are under the Inspe|ction of this <HI>Prime Vister</HI> are continually travell|ing and labouring too for the destruction of im|mortal souls. They <HI>go about,</HI> but <HI>how?</HI> We read in <HI>Jude</HI> 6. they are <HI>kept in chains;</HI> Tis by some rendered, they are kept <HI>for</HI> chains: but suppose them <HI>in</HI> chains; their chains are so <HI>lengthened,</HI> &amp; yet so <HI>limited</HI> that they <HI>go about,</HI> just where and when, and how far the Permission of God shall give them leave. As they are not now in all the <HI>Torment,</HI> so they are not now in all the <HI>Bon|dage</HI> intended for them. Twas the Sentence of

<P>Tis the Case of every <HI>devil;</HI> he is <HI>A</HI> Fugitive <HI>and a</HI> Vagabond <HI>in our Air.</HI> They <HI>go about</HI>] but <HI>Why?</HI> For no good, you may be sure. Tis with them as tis said to be with their <HI>Vassals,</HI> in <HI>Psal.</HI> 59. 15. <HI>They wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.</HI> They <HI>go about</HI> upon the <HI>Catch;</HI> they <HI>go about,</HI> that they may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> out objects to work upon; they <HI>go about,</HI> with a raging appetite after <HI>Sin,</HI> and the <HI>Wages</HI> of it on the world. You shall see what the Po|stures and Methods of the Devil are; they are drawn with a Pencil of the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> in Psal. 10. 4. <HI>He lyes in wait secretly, as a</HI> Lion <HI>in his den; he lyes in wait to catch the poor; he does catch the poor when he drawes him into his net.</HI> Such a <HI>devil|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ish</HI> Adversary ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> we to deal withal.</P>

<P>There are two Lessons that we may learn from these things. We may say after the Apostle in 1. <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 15. <HI>In this the children of God are ma|nifest and the children of the</HI> Devil.</P>
<P>First. We may see from hence, <HI>who the chil|dren of the devil</HI> are. <HI>Roaring</HI> Lions <HI>that go a|bout seeking whom they may devour,</HI> what are they but the creatures whom the <HI>Devil</HI> is a <HI>Sire</HI> unto? We read of one in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 19. 6. <HI>Who became a

young Lion and learned to catch the prey, &amp; devour|ed men.</HI> Such Lions there often are in the world; sometimes there are men whose business, whose delight it is to <HI>devour</HI> their Neighbours; men who <HI>go about</HI> to impair the Estate, who <HI>go about</HI> to blemish the <HI>esteem,</HI> who <HI>go about</HI> to <HI>debauch</HI> the <HI>souls</HI> of other men. What shall be said of <HI>such men?</HI> Alas, the <HI>Devil</HI> is the Father of them all. I have no <HI>Blessing</HI> for any of them; but yet I may say to them, <HI>This is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> whelp, to the prey, my son, thou art gone up.</HI> This is just like the great old <HI>Lion;</HI> with him, even with <HI>him</HI> shall they one day be punished, and undergo the doom in <HI>Jer.</HI> 51. 38. <HI>They shall roar together like</HI> Lions, <HI>they shall yell as</HI> Lions <HI>whelps.</HI> The great and the terible GOD will one day make the <HI>Sires</HI> and the <HI>Whelps</HI> to|gether to <HI>roar</HI> under the direful impressions of His everlasting wrath.</P>
<P>Secondly. From hence we may also see who are the Children of <HI>God.</HI> Tis said of our Lord Jesus Christ in <HI>Act.</HI> 10. 38. <HI>He went about doing good.</HI> There are some that <HI>go about</HI> seeking whom they may <HI>instruct,</HI> that <HI>go about</HI> seeking whom they may <HI>convert,</HI> that <HI>go about</HI> seeking whom they may <HI>relieve.</HI> The <HI>Lion of the tribe of Judah,</HI> is a Father to these holy men; Not the D<HI>evil</HI> but the <HI>Saviour</HI> is their pattern.

<P>We have two things now incumbent on us.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us <HI>Avoid</HI> the <HI>Roaring Lion,</HI> who <HI>goes about seeking whom he may devour.</HI> Let us not be willingly in the way of D<HI>evils,</HI> who are ever aiming at our Confusion.</P>
<P>First. Let us <HI>get</HI> from the <HI>Roaring Lion,</HI> by a sincere <HI>Turning</HI> to God in Christ. Hear &amp; quake all you that are yet in your unregenerate estate; you are in the mouth of the <HI>Roaring Lion:</HI> Oh, how can you be satisfyed or contented there? In <HI>Conversion,</HI> we are told in <HI>Act.</HI> 29. 18. men are turned <HI>from the power of satan unto God.</HI> Man, thou art under the <HI>under the power of satan,</HI> until thou art <HI>born again.</HI> O save thy self before it be <HI>too late.</HI> One once being ready to be devoured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a <HI>Lion,</HI> cry'd out, <HI>Help, help, I am yet alive! whelp, I am yet alive!</HI> O thou are <HI>yet alive,</HI> but
<PB N="14" REF="000486_0099_0FA671DB5DB57800">
if thou art not quickly redeemed from the <HI>Lion,</HI> it will ere long be <HI>All too late! All too late!</HI> Quickly then Renounce the service of the D<HI>evil;</HI> Quickly loath, quickly leave all your Sins; Quickly run to God in Christ, and say unto Him as in <HI>Isa.</HI> 26. 13 <HI>O Lord our God, other lords be|sides Thee have had dominion over us, but now we will make mention of Thy Name alone.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Let us <HI>Keep</HI> from the <HI>Roaring Lion,</HI> by a sincere <HI>Shunning</HI> of what will peculiarly bring us within his teach. Indeed every <HI>Lust,</HI> as it were surrenders us up unto the Devil: every time a man gratfies a <HI>Lust,</HI> a <HI>Devil</HI> is in|vited into the soul of that man; and by every <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hew Act</HI> of it, he takes a <HI>new Hold</HI> of the soul. But some Vices there are which give the Devils <HI>peculiar</HI> opportunities to devour us Of these take heed with a more than ordinary Caution. Particularly,</P>
<P>First. Beware of <HI>Discontent.</HI> The devils are are wonderfully <HI>discontented Spirits;</HI> and none more than <HI>discontented Persons,</HI> ly open to their Invasion and Annoyance. The <HI>discontented</HI> man is angry at <HI>God;</HI> it is a rage at <HI>God,</HI> it is a Fret at <HI>God,</HI> which discomposes him. We are told about the man that is <HI>angry</HI> at his <HI>Neighbour,</HI> in <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 27. He <HI>gives place to the devil.</HI> How much more may this be said about the man who is <HI>angry at his maker?</HI> The <HI>devil finds a place</HI> in
<PB N="15" REF="000486_0100_0FA671E02D1A5748">
the soul of such a man. Be not <HI>Angry</HI> at any <HI>Poverty,</HI> be not <HI>Angry</HI> at any <HI>Calumny,</HI> be not <HI>Angry</HI> at any <HI>Affliction</HI> whatsoever. D<HI>iscontent</HI> opens the doors of the soul for all the <HI>devils</HI> of Hell to enter in.</P>
<P>Secondly. Beware of <HI>Idleness,</HI> If <HI>thou,</HI> art <HI>I|dle,</HI> know that the <HI>devil</HI> is not so; the <HI>Idle soul</HI> is an <HI>empty House;</HI> there happens to it that thing in <HI>Mat.</HI> 12. 44. <HI>The unclean spirit walks</HI> to and fro, and <HI>comes and finds the house empty, then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits, more wicked than himself, and they enter in.</HI> When the Devil finds an <HI>Idle</HI> person, he as it were, calls to more of his crue, <HI>Come here! come h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re! A brave prize for us all!</HI> When was a D<HI>a|vid</HI> made a prize for a <HI>devil?</HI> It was when he rose from his <HI>Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h</HI> in the Afternoon, and walk|ed in his <HI>Balcony,</HI> as one that had nothing at all to do. Of <HI>Idleness comes</HI> no <HI>goodness.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. Beware of <HI>Bad Company.</HI> That is, (I had almost said) the greatest engine the de|vil has, to trepan the children of men withal An evil Companion is a <HI> Gin</HI> for a soul. The de|vils will have thee fast enough, if thou <HI>walkest in the counsil of the ungodly, and standest in the way of</HI> Sinners, <HI>and sittest in the seat of the scornful.</HI> The Devils, nay, and the <HI>Gallows</HI> too, at length often devour those that bad Company shall seduce. Twas said to them of Old, D<HI>epart from the tents of the wicked men, lest the earth swallow you up. </HI> E|ven
<PB N="16" REF="000486_0101_0FA671E2D2AF4788">
Even so, <HI>Depart</HI> from the <HI>Knots, depart</HI> from the <HI>Cups</HI> of wicked men, <HI>lest the</HI> Devil <HI>swallow you up.</HI> Tis said in <HI>Prov.</HI> 13. 20. <HI>A companion of fools shall be destroyed.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Let us <HI>Resist</HI> the <HI>Roaring Lion</HI> who <HI>goes about seeking whom he may devour.</HI></P>
<P>Do you find the <HI>Devil</HI> ready to <HI>devour</HI> you? Be you as ready to <HI>oppose</HI> him. It is mentioned as a sore calamity in <HI>Psal.</HI> 109. 6. <HI>Let Satan stand at his right hand.</HI> Alas! This is the con|dition of our souls; we have <HI>Satan at hand,</HI> seek|ing to gripe us in his hideous clawes.</P>
<P>How many <HI>Temptations</HI> does the <HI>Devil</HI> seek to to devour your souls withal? <HI>Temptations</HI> to <HI>Uncleanness</HI> and <HI>Worldliness</HI> are devouring of ma|ny. <HI>Temptations</HI> to <HI>Atheism</HI> and <HI>Blasphemy</HI> are devouring of others. Perhaps, Temptations to <HI>Self-Murder</HI> have near devoured some unhappy souls. O Remember whence all these <HI>Temptations</HI> do arise. These things are the <HI>Roarings</HI> of the Hellish <HI>Lion;</HI> and will you hearken to <HI>him?</HI> Is there any thing in these cursed <HI>Roarings</HI> to per|swade your Hearkning thereunto? What Bene|fit, what Advantage, do you think these horrid <HI>Roarings</HI> can propound?</P>
<P>Come then, Resist the <HI>Temptations</HI> of this <HI>roar|ing Lion.</HI> Tis said in <HI>Jam.</HI> 4. 7. Resist <HI>the devil, and he will flee from you.</HI> If you <HI>fly,</HI> he will be a <HI>Lion,</HI> if you <HI>fight,</HI> he will be a <HI>Gnat</HI> before you. <HI>Est</HI> Leo, <HI>si</HI> fugias; <HI>si</HI> stas, <HI>quasi</HI> musca <HI>recedit.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="000486_0102_0FA671E2E52E4B98">
Your Encounters call for two Things.</P>
<P>One is, your <HI>Watch.</HI> Hence tis here said, <HI>Be vigilant, because your adversary the devil, as a roar|ing lion walketh about.</HI> When it was cry'd out unto the Champion of <HI>Israel</HI> in <HI>Judg.</HI> 16 20. <HI>The Philistines be upon thee, Sampson;</HI> Then <HI>he awoke out of his sleep.</HI> Thus it may be exclamed, <HI>The</HI> Lions <HI>are upon thee O soul.</HI> O how watchful, how wakeful should this cause thee to be.

<P>The Second is your <HI>Faith.</HI> Tis recorded in <HI>heb.</HI> 11. 33. some <HI>by</HI> Faith <HI>stopped the mouthes</HI> of <HI>Lions.</HI></P>
<P>Tho thou shouldst be in a <HI>Denful</HI> of them, yet <HI>Faith,</HI> true <HI>Faith</HI> would muzzle them <HI>all.</HI> By <HI>Faith</HI> repair to Christ, who is the true <HI>Samp|son,</HI> which meets and slayes the Lions that roar upon our souls.

<P>There are particularly two sorts of devour|ing <HI>Temptations,</HI> which I would conclude this Di|sourse with some sutable R<HI>eflections</HI> on.</P>
<P>Temptations to <HI>Atheism</HI> and <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> per|haps do molest some among us; possibly, <HI>Terribilia

<P>Do not so much <HI>dispute,</HI> as <HI>deny</HI> the Injections of the wicked one. Don't give the devil so much honour as to <HI>argue</HI> &amp; <HI>parley</HI> about his sewd <HI>propo|sals.</HI> Refuse them presently, refuse them pe|remptorily; so you <HI>silence</HI> them. When once an <HI>Atheistic</HI> or <HI>Blasphemous</HI> Thought appears with|in your Minds, immediately hiss it away, as the Priests did <HI>Uzziah,</HI> when they first saw the Le|prosie in his <HI>Forehead.</HI> Let such Thoughts, im|mediately occasion in you the savory &amp; gracious Thoughts that shall be just contrary thereunto. If the devil would have you think, <HI>There is</HI> no <HI>God,</HI> then without any more a do, spite the de|vil by such a Thought with an Ejaculation contradicting of it, <HI>Lord, I beleeve that thou art, and that thou art a</HI> Rewarder <HI>too.</HI> Don't object, <HI>What if there be</HI> no <HI>God?</HI> But suppose for once, That God <HI>is.</HI> Tis by far the <HI>safer</HI> Supposal of the two. And then try whether to <HI>Weary</HI> the devil be not the best way to <HI>Corquer</HI> him. Let every <HI>Fiery dart</HI> of <HI>Satan</HI> fetch an <HI>holy dart</HI> of Prayer &amp; Grace from thee, and the de|vil will soon be weary of his Methods.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="000486_0104_0FA671E529840188">
Temptations to <HI>Self-Murder,</HI> may likewise be fierce upon some unhappy people here. Tis al|most unaccountable, that at some times in some places here, melancholy distempered Ragings toward <HI>Self-Murder,</HI> have been in a manner <HI>Epi|demical.</HI> And it would make ones hair stand, to see or hear what manifest Assistance the Devils have given to these <HI>unnatural Self-executions</HI> when <HI>once</HI> they have been begun. Tis <HI>too</HI> evident, that persons are commonly <HI>bewitch't</HI> or <HI>possess't</HI> into these unreasonable <HI>Phrensies.</HI> But What shall these hurried people do?  My Advice is,</P>
<P>Don't <HI>Conceal,</HI> much less <HI>Obey</HI> the motions of your Adversary. Failing in this, made a poor man, after a faithful sermon in a Neighbouring Town, presently to drown himself in a pit that had not two foot of water in it. If you will not <HI>Keep,</HI> that is the way not to <HI>Take</HI> the De|vil Counsil. Let not him <HI>tye</HI> your <HI>Tongues,</HI> and it is likely he will not <HI>gain</HI> your <HI>Souls.</HI> Com|plain to a good <HI>God</HI> of the Dangers in which you find your selves; cry to Him, <HI>Lord, I am oppres|sed, undertake for me.</HI> Complain also to a wise <HI>Friend.</HI> Let some prudent and faithful Neigh|bour understand your Circumstances: Tis pos|sible you may thereby escape the <HI>Snares</HI> with which the cruel <HI>Fowlers</HI> of <HI>Hell</HI> hope to trepan you into their dismal Clutches for evermore.
<PB N="20" REF="000486_0105_0FA671E5DBD2C998">
Your Neighbours may do much for you, and may prove your <HI>Keepers</HI> if God shall please. It may be the <HI>unkindness</HI> of some Friend, may have thrown you into your present Madness. Now the <HI>Kindness</HI> of some Friend may prove the Anti|dote. <HI>Many times,</HI> a <HI>Natural Distemper,</HI> is that by which the Devil takes advantage to get the souls of Self-Destroyers into his bloody hands. In this case, for the tempted persons to <HI>disclose</HI> their <HI>Griefs,</HI> will be the way to <HI>obtain</HI> their <HI>cures.</HI> Their Neighbours ought now to consult a <HI>skilful Physician</HI> for them; and <HI>oblige,</HI> yea, <HI>constrain</HI> them to follow his Directions. When the <HI>Hu|mours</HI> on &amp; <HI>by</HI> which the Devil works, are taken away, perhaps he may be starved out of doors. <HI>Many times,</HI> again, The sin of <HI>Slothfulness</HI> gives the Devil opportunity to procure the Self-De|struction of the sluggard. In this case too, the Tempted person may be succoured by the <HI>stand|ers-by</HI> becoming sensible of their Circumstances. Their Neighbours may now <HI>compel</HI> them to fol|low their business.

<P>But <HI>most times,</HI> There may be some old and great <HI>Sin</HI> unrepented of, where Temptations to <HI>Self-Murder</HI> have a violence hardly to be with|stood, There was once a man among us, who in the horrours of Despair, uttered many dread|ful

speeches against himself, and would often particularly say, <HI>I am all on a</HI> light Fire <HI>under the wrath of God!</HI> This man yet never confess|ed any unusual sin, but this; that having gotten about Forty pounds by his Labour, he had <HI>spent</HI> it in <HI>wicked Company:</HI> but in his Anguish of spi|rit he hanged himself.

<P>By the ensuing <HI>Propositions</HI> we may state and shape this Truth aright in our minds.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROP. I.</HEAD>
<P>Such an Hellish thing there is as <HI>Witchcraft</HI> in the World. There are Two things which will be desired for the advantage of this Assertion. It should <HI>first</HI> be show'd,  WHAT Witchraft is;</P>
<P>My Hearers will not expect from me an accu|rate <HI>Definition</HI> of the <HI>vile Thing;</HI> since the Grace of God has given me the Happiness to speak without <HI>Experience</HI> of it. But from Accounts both by <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Hearing</HI> I have learn'd to describe it so.</P>
<P>WITCHCRAFT is the Doing of <HI>Strange</HI> (and for the most part <HI>III</HI>) Things by the help of <HI>evil Spirits, Covenanting</HI> with (and usually <HI>Representing</HI> of) the woful Children of men.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>Diabolical Art</HI> that <HI>Witches</HI> are no|torious for.</P>
<P>First. <HI>Witches</HI> are the Doers of <HI>Strange</HI> Things They cannot indeed perform any proper <HI>Mira|cles;</HI> those are things to be done only by the <HI>Favourites</HI> and <HI>Embassadours</HI> of the LORD. But <HI>Wonders</HI> are often produced by them, though
<PB N="5" REF="000486_0111_0FA671ED45539DF0">
chiefly such Wonders as the Apostle calls in 2. <HI>Thes.</HI> 2. 9. <HI>Lying wonders.</HI> There are <HI>won|derful Storms</HI> in the <HI>great</HI> World, and <HI>wonderful Wounds in</HI> the <HI>little</HI> World, often effected by these <HI>evil Causes.</HI> They do things which tran|scend the ordinary <HI>Course</HI> of Nature, and which puzzle the ordinary <HI>Sense</HI> of Mankind. Some <HI>strange</HI> things are done by them in a way of <HI>Real Production.</HI> They do really <HI>Torment,</HI> they do really <HI>Afflict</HI> those that their Spite shall extend unto. Other <HI>Strange</HI> Things are done by them in a way of <HI>Crafty Illusion.</HI> They do craftily make of the <HI>Air,</HI> the <HI>Figures</HI> and <HI>Colours</HI> of things that never can be truly created by them. All men might <HI>see,</HI> but, I believe, no man could <HI>feel</HI> some of the Things which the <HI>Magicians</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> exhibited of old.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> They are not only <HI>strange</HI> Things, but <HI>Ill</HI> Things, that <HI>Witches</HI> are the Doers of. In this regard also they are not the Authors of <HI>Mira|cles:</HI> those are things <HI>commonly</HI> done for the <HI>Good</HI> of Man, <HI>alwaies</HI> done for the <HI>Praise</HI> of <HI>GOD.</HI> But of these <HI>Hell-hounds</HI> it may in a special man|ner be said, as in <HI>Psal.</HI> 52. 3. <HI>Thou lovest evil more than good.</HI> For the most part they labour to robb <HI>Man</HI> of his <HI>Ease</HI> or his <HI>Wealth;</HI> they labour to wrong <HI>God</HI> of His <HI>Glory.</HI> There is Men|tion of Creatures that they call <HI>White Whitches,</HI> which do only <HI>Good-Turns</HI> for their Neighbours. I suspect that there are none of that sort;
<PB N="6" REF="000486_0112_0FA671ED60BEACD8">
but rather think, <HI>There is none that deeth good no, not one.</HI> If they <HI>do good,</HI> it is only that they <HI>may</HI> do <HI>hurt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> It is by virtue of <HI>evil Spirits</HI> that <HI>Witches</HI> do what they do. We read in <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2, 2. about the <HI>Prince of the power of the air.</HI> There is confined unto the <HI>Atmosphere</HI> of our <HI>Air</HI> a vast <HI>Power,</HI> or <HI>Army</HI> of <HI>Evil Spirits,</HI> under the Government of a Prince who employes them in a continual Opposition to the Designs of GOD: The Name of that <HI>Leviathan</HI> who is the <HI>Grand|Segniour of Hell,</HI> we find in the Scripture to be <HI>Belzebub.</HI> Under the Command of that mighty Tyrant, there are vast <HI>Legions</HI> &amp; <HI>Myriads</HI> of De|vils, whose <HI>Businesses</HI> &amp; <HI>Accomplishments</HI> are not all the same. Every one has his <HI>Post,</HI> and his <HI>Work;</HI> and they are all glad of an opportunity to he <HI>mischievous</HI> in the World. These are they by whom <HI>Witches</HI> do exert their Devillish and ma|lignant Rage upon their <HI>Neighbours:</HI> And espe|cially Two Acts concur hereunto. The <HI>First</HI> is, Their <HI>Covenanting</HI> with the Witches. There is a most hellish <HI>League</HI> made between them, with va|rious <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies.</HI> The <HI>Witches</HI> promise to serve the <HI>Devils,</HI> and the <HI>Devils</HI> promise to <HI>help</HI> the Witches; <HI>How?</HI> It is not convenient to be related. The <HI>Second</HI> is, Their <HI>Representing</HI> of the Witches. And hereby indeed these are drawn into <HI>Snares</HI> and <HI>Cords</HI> of Death. The <HI>Devils,</HI> when they go upon the Errands of the <HI>Witches,</HI> do
<PB N="7" REF="000486_0113_0FA671EE520F4A80">
hear their <HI>Names;</HI> and hence do <HI>Harmes</HI> too come to be carried from the <HI>Devils</HI> to the <HI>Witches.</HI> We need not suppose such a wild thing as the <HI>Transforming</HI> of those Wretches into <HI>Bruits</HI> or <HI>Birds,</HI> as we too often do.</P>
<P>It should next be proved <HI>THAT</HI> Witch|craft <HI>is.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Being</HI> of such a thing is denied by many that place a <HI>great part</HI> of their <HI>small wit</HI> in deride|ing the Stories that are told of it. Their chief Argument is, That they never <HI>saw</HI> any Witches, therefore there are <HI>none.</HI> Just as if you or I should say, We never met with any <HI>Robbers</HI> on the Road, therefore there never was any <HI>Padding</HI> there.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>Devils</HI> are loath to have true No|tions of <HI>Witches</HI> entertained with us. I have beheld them to put out the eyes of an enchaunted Child, when a Book that proves, <HI>There is Witch|craft,</HI> was laid before her. But there are espe|cially Two Demonstrations that evince the Be|ing of that Infernal mysterious thing.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> We have the Testimony of <HI>Scripture</HI> for it. We find <HI>Witchcrafts</HI> often mentioned, sometimes by way of <HI>Assertion,</HI> sometimes by way of <HI>Allusion,</HI> in the Oracles of God. Besides that, We have there the History of diverse <HI>Witches</HI> in these infallible and inspired Writings. Particularly, the Instance of the <HI>Witch</HI> at <HI>Endor,</HI> in 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 28. 7. is so plain and full that
<PB N="8" REF="000486_0114_0FA671EED93143B8">
<HI>Witchcraft</HI> it self is not a more amazing thing, than any <HI>Dispute</HI> about the Being of it, after this. The Advocates of <HI>Witches</HI> must use more <HI>Tricks</HI> to make Nonsense of the <HI>Bible,</HI> than ever the <HI>Witch</HI> of <HI>Endor</HI> used in her Magical Incantations, if they would evade the Force of that famous History. They that will believe no <HI>Witches,</HI> do imagine that <HI>Jugglers</HI> only are meant by them whom the Sacred Writ calleth so. But what do they think of that Law in <HI>Exod.</HI> 22. 18. <HI>Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live?</HI> Methinks 'tis a little too hard to punish every silly <HI>Juggler</HI> with so great S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">rity.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> We have the <HI>Testimony</HI> of <HI>Experience</HI> for it. What will those <HI>Incredulous,</HI> who must be the only <HI>Ingenious</HI> men say to This? Many <HI>Witches</HI> have like those in <HI>Act.</HI> 19. 18. <HI>Con|fessed and shewed their Deeds</HI> We see those things done, that it is impossible any <HI>Disease,</HI> or any <HI>Deceit</HI> should procure. We see some hideous <HI>Wretches</HI> in hideous <HI>Horrours</HI> confessing, <HI>That they did the Mischiefs.</HI> This Confession is often made by them that are owners of as much Rea|son as the people that laugh at all <HI>Conceit</HI> of <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">chraft:</HI> the exactest Scrutiny of skilful Phy|sicians cannot find any Distraction in their minds. This <HI>Confession</HI> is often made by them that are apart One from another, and yet they <HI>agree</HI> in all the Circumstances of it. <HI>T</HI>his <HI>Confession</HI> is often made by them that at the same time will

<P>WITCHCRAFT is a most Monstrous and Horrid <HI>Evil.</HI> Indeed there is a vast Heap of bloody roaring Impieties contained in the <HI>Bowels</HI> of it. <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> is a Renouncing of <HI>GOD,</HI> and Advancing of a filthy <HI>Devil</HI> into the Throne of the Most High; 'tis the most nefandous <HI>High-Treason</HI> against the MAJESTY on High. <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> is a Renouncing of <HI>Christ,</HI> and Preferring the Communion of a loathsome lying <HI>Devil</HI> before all the Salvation of the Lord Redeemer; 'tis a Trampling under foot that <HI>Blood</HI> which is more precious than <HI>Hills</HI> of <HI>Sil|ver,</HI> or whole <HI>Mountains</HI> of <HI>Gold.</HI> There is in <HI>Witchraft,</HI> a most explicit <HI>Renouncing</HI> of all that is <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Just</HI> and <HI>Good.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> given by <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>Prayer</HI> taught by <HI>Christ,</HI> the <HI>Creed</HI> left by the <HI>Apostles,</HI> is become Abominable where <HI>Witchcraft</HI> is embraced: The very Reciting of those blessed Things is commonly burdensome where <HI>Witchcraft</HI> is.

<HEAD>PROP. III.</HEAD>
<P>REBELLION against God has very much like to <HI>Witchraft</HI> in it. Something like to <HI>Witch|craft</HI> there is in an <HI>Act</HI> of Rebellion; But a <HI>Course</HI> of Rebellion has much more like to <HI>Witch|craft</HI> in it. Some persons there are whose <HI>way</HI> is

is that of <HI>wickedness,</HI> whose <HI>work</HI> is that of <HI>Iniquity.</HI> Those persons do what is <HI>like Witchcraft</HI> every day.</P>
<P>For, <HI>First.</HI> In <HI>Rebellion,</HI> men cast off the <HI>Au|thority</HI> of God<HI>:</HI> The <HI>Witch</HI> declares a Will to be no more disposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ordered by the Will of <HI>God;</HI> she says, <HI>God shall not be my Governour.</HI> Such is the Language of <HI>Rebellion.</HI> When men <HI>rebel</HI> against God. They say like him in <HI>Exod.</HI> 5. 2. <HI>I know not the Lord, and I will not obey His voice.</HI> They say like them in <HI>Jer.</HI> 44. 16. <HI>As for the word&mdash;spoken&mdash;in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken thereunto.</HI> There is indeed a sort of <HI>Atheism</HI> in <HI>Rebellion</HI> The Sinner is a <HI>Fool</HI> that wishes, <HI>O that there were no God!</HI> that resolves, <HI>God shall not be Lord over me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> In <HI>Rebellion</HI> men Refuse the <HI>Salvati|on</HI> of <HI>Christ.</HI> The <HI>Witch</HI> contemns all the Offers of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and prizes the dirty proffers that <HI>Satan</HI> makes before them all. This is the plain English of <HI>Rebellion;</HI> it sayes, <HI>What is tendred by the</HI> Devil, <HI>is better than what is tendred by the</HI> Saviour. The LORD said about <HI>Israel</HI> of old in <HI>Psal.</HI> 81. 11. Israel <HI>would none of Me.</HI> Thus 'tis when men <HI>rebel</HI> against God. A <HI>Jesus</HI> may say, <HI>Those poor creatures will have none of Me, nor of My Bloud.</HI> A <HI>Pardon</HI> may say, <HI>Those guilty creatures will have none of me.</HI> A <HI>Kingdom</HI> may say, <HI>Those undone creatures will have none of me.</HI> Where <HI>Sin</HI> is committed, there <HI>Christ</HI> is de|spised. This doleful <HI>Phrensy</HI> is in all <HI>Rebellion</HI> a|gainst the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="000486_0118_0FA671F724D03990">
<HI>Thirdly.</HI> In <HI>Rebellion</HI> men <HI>choose</HI> and <HI>serve</HI> the the <HI>Devil</HI> as their Lord. The <HI>Witch</HI> makes an horrible Agreement with <HI>Devils,</HI> to be <HI>theirs</HI> a|lone. This is the intent of all <HI>Rebellion</HI> too. It in short saies, <HI>Let the</HI> Devil <HI>rule;</HI> it sayes, <HI>Let the</HI> Devil <HI>be humour'd and gratify'd.</HI> As that cow|ardly King said unto the <HI>Syrian,</HI> 1. <HI>King.</HI> 20. 4. <HI>My Lord, O King, I am thine and all that I have.</HI> Thus the ungodly man saves unto the Devil; <HI>Thou art my Lord and my King.</HI> All <HI>Re|bellion</HI> against God, is in <HI>Obedience</HI> to the <HI>Devil.</HI> When men <HI>rebel,</HI> they lay their <HI>Wit,</HI> their <HI>Love,</HI> their <HI>Strength,</HI> and all the Instruments of that Rebellion before the Devil, and they say, <HI>This is</HI> thine, <HI>O Satan, and all that they have.</HI> They do even <HI>sell themselves to the Devil!</HI> as we read of one, <HI>He sold himself to work wickedness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> In <HI>Rebellion,</HI> Men cast the <HI>Bond</HI> and the <HI>Good</HI> of their <HI>Baptism</HI> behind their Back. Among the Customs of <HI>Witches,</HI> this is one, They <HI>Renounce</HI> their <HI>Baptism</HI> in a manner very Diabo|lical. The same thing is done in the <HI>Rebellion</HI> of a wicked man. We are told in 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 21. that the thing which renders <HI>Baptism</HI> available is <HI>The answer of a good Conscience.</HI> But in <HI>Rebelli|on</HI> against God, men give the answer of an <HI>Evil</HI> Conscience, and so make a <HI>Nullity</HI> of their Sacred, Baptism. The Demand of God is, <HI>Wilt thou Beleeve as Baptised persons do profess to do?</HI> The <HI>Rebel</HI> answers, <HI>No, I will continue shutt up in my Unbeleef.</HI> The Demand of God is, <HI>Willt
<PB N="13" REF="000486_0119_0FA671F7DE90E3E0">
thou put on Christ, as the Baptised profess to do?</HI> The <HI>Rebel</HI> answers, <HI>No, I will put on the old man.</HI> The Almighty God puts that Question, <HI>Wilt thou forsake the</HI> World, <HI>the</HI> Flesh, <HI>and the</HI> Devil, <HI>as thy</HI> Baptism <HI>dos oblige to do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> In <HI>Rebellion</HI> the Answer of sinful man, is, <HI>No, I will serve them all; they shall all be the Idols of my Soul.</HI> With what Conscience can they answer so! But thus their <HI>Baptism</HI> is nothing with them.</P>
<P><HI>Fiftly.</HI> All that <HI>rebel</HI> against God, are ve|ry <HI>Mischievous</HI> in doing so. They are <HI>Mischiefs</HI> that <HI>Witches</HI> are delighted in. Thus 'tis the end of <HI>Rebellion</HI> to bring <HI>destruction</HI> upon all that are near unto it. 'Tis said in <HI>Eccles.</HI> 9. 18. <HI>One sin|ner</HI> destroyeth <HI>much good.</HI> It is the ill-Hap of <HI>Sin|ners</HI> like <HI>Witches</HI> to <HI>do hurt</HI> wherever they come; they <HI>hurt</HI> the <HI>souls</HI> of their Neighbours by the Ve|nome of their <HI>Evil Communication;</HI> they <HI>hurt</HI> the <HI>Names</HI> of their Neighbours by their <HI>slandrous Defamation;</HI> they <HI>hurt</HI> their <HI>Estates</HI> by bring|ing down the fiery Judgments of Heaven upon all the Neighbourhood. Unto <HI>Rebellion</HI> against God, are owing all the Distresses and Miseries of a calamitous World. This is the <HI>Achan,</HI> this is the <HI>Troubler</HI> of us all.</P>
<P>The Improvement of these things now calls for our <HI>Earnest Heed;</HI> and unto each of our Three Propositions, we may annex <HI>Applications</HI> agreeable thereunto. I begin with</P>
<P>The USE of the <HI>First Proposition.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="000486_0120_0FA671F89CF06E98">
1. By way of <HI>INFORMATION.</HI></P>
<P>There are especially Two <HI>Inferences</HI> to be drawn from this Position, <HI>That, Such a thing there is as</HI> Witchcraft <HI>in the world.</HI></P>
<P>[First.] Since there are <HI>Witches,</HI> we are to suppose that there are <HI>Devils</HI> too. Those are the Objects that <HI>Witches</HI> converse withal. It was the Heresy of the ancient <HI>Sadducees</HI> in <HI>Act.</HI> 23. 8. <HI>The</HI> Sadducees <HI>do say, That there is neither Angel nor spirit.</HI> And there are multitudes of <HI>Saddu|cees</HI> yet in our dayes; <HI>Fools,</HI> that say, <HI>Seeing is Beleeving;</HI> and will <HI>beleeve</HI> nothing but what they <HI>see.</HI> A <HI>Devil,</HI> is in the apprehension of those Mighty acute Philosophers, no more than a <HI>Quality,</HI> or a <HI>Distemper.</HI> But, as <HI>Paul</HI> said unto Him of old, <HI>King</HI> Agrippa, <HI>Beleevest thou the Prophets?</HI> Thus I would say, <HI>Friend, Beleev|est thou the Scriptures?</HI> I pray, What sort of things were they, of whom we read in <HI>Jude.</HI> 6.? <HI>Angels that kept not their first estate, but left their own Habitation, and be reserved in chains unto the judgment of the great day.</HI> What sort of things were they, who in <HI>Matth.</HI> 18. 16. <HI>Besought</HI> our Lord, <HI>If thou cast us out, suffer us to go into the herd of swine?</HI> What thing was that, which in <HI>Luc.</HI> 4. 33. cryed out unto the Lord Jesus with a loud voice, <HI>Let us alone?</HI> Surely, These things could be none but <HI>Spiritual and rational substan|ces, full of all</HI> Wickeness <HI>against God, and</HI> Enmity <HI>against Man.</HI> We shall come to have no <HI>Christ</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="000486_0121_0FA671F979F7B0F0">
but a <HI>Light within,</HI> and no <HI>Heaven</HI> but a <HI>Frame of mind,</HI> if the Scriptures must be expounded af|ter the Rules of the modern <HI>Sadducees.</HI> Per|haps tho' the <HI>Scriptures</HI> are <HI>Fables</HI> to that sort of men. Come then, thou <HI>Sadducee,</HI> What kind of thing is that which will so handle to|wardly ingenuous well-disposed persons, That if any <HI>Devotions</HI> be performed, they shall <HI>roar</HI> &amp; <HI>tear</HI> unreasonably, and have such <HI>Noises</HI> and such <HI>Tortures</HI> in them, as not only to hinder them|selves <HI>wholly,</HI> but others <HI>too much</HI> from joyning in the Service; and strive to <HI>kick</HI> or <HI>strike</HI> the Minister in his Prayers, but have their <HI>hands</HI> or <HI>feet</HI> strange|ly stopt when they are just come at him, and yet be quiet before and after the <HI>Worship?</HI> That if any <HI>Idle</HI> or <HI>Useless</HI> Discourse be going, they shall be well, but at any <HI>serious</HI> Discourse they shall be tormented in all their Limbs? That If a portion of the <HI>Bible</HI> be readd, tho they <HI>see</HI> and <HI>hear</HI> nothing of it, and tho, it may be, in <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Hebrew</HI> too, they shall fall into terri|ble Agonies, which will be over when the <HI>Bible</HI> is laid aside? That they shall be able to per|use whole <HI>Pages</HI> of <HI>Evil Books,</HI> but scarce a <HI>Line</HI> of a <HI>good one?</HI> That they shall <HI>Move</HI> and <HI>Fly,</HI> and <HI>Tell secret things,</HI> as no ordinary mortals can? Let me ask, <HI>Is not the hand of</HI> Joab <HI>in all this?</HI> or, Is there not a <HI>Divel</HI> whose Agency must account for things that are so extravagant? I am now to tell you, <HI>That these eye, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine have be|held
<PB N="16" REF="000486_0122_0FA671FBB04963A0">
held all these things,</HI> and many other more, no less amazing. Christian, There are <HI>Devils:</HI> and so many of them too, that sometimes a <HI>Legion</HI> of them are spar'd for the vexation of <HI>one man.</HI> The <HI>Air</HI> in which we breath is full of them. Be sensible of this, you that <HI>obey God:</HI> there are Troops of <HI>Tempters</HI> on every side of thee. <HI>Awake,</HI> O Soul, Awake, Those <HI>Philistines</HI> of Hell <HI>are upon thee.</HI> Upon the least affrightment in the dark, many simple people cry out, <HI>The Devil! The De|vil!</HI> Alas, there are <HI>Devils</HI> thronging about thee every day. O let the thought of it make then a careful and a watchful man. And be sensible of this you that <HI>commit Sin:</HI> the Lord Jesus hath said of you, <HI>Ye will do the lusts of your father the</HI> De|vil. How often do many of you make a <HI>Mock</HI> and a <HI>Jeer</HI> of the Devil while you are drudging for him? But know, that there are dreadful <HI>Devils</HI> to seize upon thy forlorn forsaken soul, at its departure hence. O become a new man at the thought of this.</P>
<P N="2">2. Since there are <HI>Witches</HI> and <HI>Devils,</HI> we may conclude that there are also <HI>Immortal Souls. Devils</HI> would never contract with <HI>Witches</HI> for their Souls if there were no such things to be come a prey unto them. One of the <HI>Popes</HI> when he lay dying, said, <HI>I shall now quickly know whe|ther I have an</HI> Immortal Soul <HI>or no.</HI> Within less than a hundred years, you &amp; I shall be convinced of it, if we are not so before. We may truly
<PB N="17" REF="000486_0123_0FA672007AFB5D80">
say, <HI>Devils</HI> &amp; <HI>Witches</HI> bear a witness against them that have any scruple of it. There are some dreaming Hereticks, that hold <HI>Man wholly mortal:</HI> I am sure the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> was not of their <HI>beast|ly</HI> Opinion, when he said in <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 21. <HI>I de|sire to be dissolved and to be with Christ.</HI> Nor was the Martyr <HI>Stephen</HI> of their Opinion, when he expired, saying, in <HI>Act.</HI> 7. 59. <HI>Lord Jesus Re|ceive my spirit.</HI> Nor was our Lord Jesus Himself of that opinion, when He said unto the Theef on the Cross in <HI>Luc.</HI> 23. 43. <HI>This day thou shalt the with Me in Paradise.</HI> Tis an Opinion unwor|thy of a man that is owner of a <HI>Soul.</HI> The mis|taken <HI>Indians,</HI> when first they saw a man on Horse-back, did conceit the <HI>Man</HI> and the <HI>Horse</HI> to be <HI>one</HI> Creature: it is as soul an Error to conceit that it is but <HI>one thing</HI> which man consist|eth of. No, 'Tis a right <HI>Anatomy</HI> of <HI>man,</HI> in <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 7. <HI>The Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living</HI> SOUL Remember, Thou hast in thee a <HI>living soul;</HI> or a <HI>Spirit,</HI> able to <HI>know,</HI> and <HI>will,</HI> and <HI>argue</HI> so as|nothing else in the <HI>visible Creation</HI> can. This <HI>li|ving soul</HI> is the <HI>Candle of the Lord</HI> within thee, and no Wind, no Death can ever extinguish it. O make much of this <HI>living</HI> SOUL. <HI>Save</HI> it, and don't <HI>sell</HI> it: It is a <HI>Jewel</HI> too precious to be thrown away. Do not <HI>sell</HI> thy <HI>soul</HI> for a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Take heed that the Devils make it not their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by any sollies of thine.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="000486_0124_0FA67201ACB1ECD0">
II. By way of <HI>Exhortrtion.</HI></P>
<P>There is one thing to be now pressed upon us all.</P>
<P>Let us wisely endeavour to be preserved from the Molestations of all <HI>Witchraft</HI> whatsoever. Since there is a thing so dangerous, <HI>defend</HI> your selves, and <HI>shelter</HI> your selves by all <HI>right</HI> means against the annoyance of it.</P>
<P>Consider the <HI>Multitudes</HI> of them, whom <HI>Witch|craft</HI> hath sometimes given <HI>Trouble to.</HI> Persons of <HI>all sorts</HI> have been racked and ruin'd by it: and not a <HI>few</HI> of them neither. It is hardly twenty years ago, that a whole Kingdom in <HI>Eu|rope</HI> was alarum'd by such potent <HI>Witchcrafts,</HI> that some hundreds of poor Children were inva|ded with them. Persons of great <HI>Honour</HI> have sometimes been cruelly <HI>bewitched.</HI> What lately befell a worthy <HI>Knight</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is well known unto the world. Persons of great <HI>Vertue</HI> too, have been bewitched, even into their Graves. But Four years are passed since a holy man was kill'd in this doleful way, after the <HI>Joy</HI> as well as the <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD had been wonderfully fill|ing of him. This Consideration should keep us from <HI>censuring</HI> of those that <HI>Witchcraft</HI> may give Disturbance to<HI>:</HI> but it should put us on <HI>study|ing</HI> of our own security. <HI>Suppose ye</HI> that the <HI>en|chanted Family</HI> in the Town, <HI>were sinners above all</HI> the Town, <HI>because they have suffered such things. I tell ye Nay, but except ye repent, ye may</HI> all <HI>be so dealt withal.</HI> The Father of <HI>Lies</HI> uttered an aw|ful
<PB N="19" REF="000486_0125_0FA672025D2E7968">
Truth when he said through the mouth of a possessed man, <HI>If God would give me leave, I would find enough in the best of you all, to make you all mine.</HI></P>
<P>Consider also, the <HI>Misery</HI> of them whom <HI>Witchcraft</HI> may be <HI>let loose</HI> upon. If <HI>David</HI> thought it a sad thing to <HI>fall into the hands of</HI> men; What is it to <HI>fall into the hands of</HI> Devils? The Hands of <HI>Turks,</HI> of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> of <HI>Indians,</HI> are not so dreadful as those hands that <HI>Witches</HI> do their <HI>works of Darkness</HI> by. O what a direful thing is it, to be prick't with <HI>Pins,</HI> and stab'd with <HI>Knives</HI> all over, and to be fill'd all over with <HI>broken Bones?</HI> 'Tis impossible to reckon up the Varieties of miseries which those Monsters inflict where they can have a Blow. No less than <HI>Death,</HI> and that a languishing and a terrible <HI>Death</HI> will satisfie the Rage of those formidable Dragons. Indeed <HI>Witchcraft</HI> sometimes growes up into <HI>Pos|session</HI> it self: the Devils that are permitted to <HI>torment,</HI> at last do possess the <HI>Bodies</HI> of the <HI>be|witched sufferers.</HI> But who can bear the thoughts of that! who can forbear crying out, <HI>O Lord, my flesh trembles for fear of Thee, and I am afraid of Thy Judgements.</HI></P>
<P>What shall then be done for our <HI>Preservati|on?</HI> Away with all <HI>superstitious</HI> Preservatives; about <HI>those</HI> Confidences the Word of God is that in <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 37. <HI>Thou shalt not prosper in them.</HI></P>
<P>But there are Three admirable <HI>Amulets</HI> that
<PB N="20" REF="000486_0126_0FA672031F00CC50">
I can heartily recommend unto you all.</P>
<P>The First Preservative is, <HI>A servent</HI> PRAYER. Pour out that <HI>prayer</HI> before the Lord, in <HI>psal,</HI> 59 2, 3. <HI>Deliver me from the workers of</HI> Iniquity, <HI>and save me from the bloody ones; for lo, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e in wait for my soul.</HI> And be much in Prayer every day. The Devils are <HI>afraid</HI> of our <HI>Pray|ers;</HI> they tremble and complain, and are in a sort of <HI>Anguish</HI> while our <HI>Prayers</HI> are going. There was a house of a Renowned Minister in <HI>France</HI> infested with <HI>evil Spirits;</HI> who tho' they had been very troublesome, yet when the good man was betaking himself to prayer, they would say, <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w you are going to</HI> Prayer, <HI>I'll be gone.</HI> Let us <HI>Pray</HI> much, and we need <HI>fear</HI> nothing particularly, Let <HI>Ejaculatory</HI> Prayers be almost continually in our minds, and so we shall never ly open to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ry darts of the wicked one.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Preservative is <HI>A lively Faith.</HI> The Psalmist <HI>well</HI> said, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 56. 2, 3, <HI>Mint enemies would daily swallow me up; At what time I am afraid I will trust in thee.</HI> Be not <HI>afraid of</HI> any <HI>Devils;</HI> If you are, turn the <HI>Fear</HI> into <HI>Faith.</HI> By <HI>Faith</HI> resign your selves to the Cust|ody of Him that is <HI>the Keeper of Israel.</HI> By <HI>Faith</HI> perswade yourselves that <HI>He is able to keep what you have committed unto Him.</HI> Thus, Run to the <HI>Rock,</HI> and there triumph over all the <HI>powers of darkness.</HI> Triumph and say; <HI>The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: What can Hell do unto me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="000486_0127_0FA67203D9B2CBE0">
The Third Preservative is, <HI>A Holy Life.</HI> There was a very <HI>Holy</HI> Man of old, <HI>a man, that feared God &amp; eschewed evil;</HI> and the Devils mur|mur'd in <HI>Job,</HI> 1. 10. <HI>God has made on hedge a|bout him.</HI> The same have the Devils confest, when they have plotted against other holy men. Do not thou break the hedge of God's <HI>Com|mandment,</HI> and perhaps he will not let any break the hedge of His <HI>Providence,</HI> by which thou art secured. The holy <HI>Ang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ls</HI> are the Friends, the Guardians, the Companions, of all <HI>holy men;</HI> they may open their eyes, and see <HI>more with them than against them.</HI> A <HI>Camp,</HI> an <HI>Host</HI> of <HI>An|gels</HI> will fight against all the <HI>Harpies</HI> of Hell which may offer to devour a Saint of GOD.</P>
<P>Use these things as the <HI>Shields</HI> of the Lord; so you shall be <HI>preserved in Christ Jesus</HI> from the assaults of the <HI>Destroyer.</HI> Suppose now that any <HI>Witches</HI> may let fly their <HI>Curses</HI> at you, you are now like a <HI>Bird</HI> on the <HI>Wing,</HI> in such Heaven|ward Motions that they cannot hitt you. Now the <HI>Devils</HI> and their Creatures cannot say of you, as the <HI>Daemon</HI> said of the Christian woman whom, at a <HI>Stage-play</HI> he took <HI>possession</HI> of, and being asked, gave this reason of his taking her, <HI>I found her on my own ground.</HI></P>
<P>We pass on to the USE of the <HI>Second proposition.</HI></P>
<P>And that must be a <HI>Counsel</HI> from God unto us all. particularly,

<P>The best man that ever breathed was <HI>tempted</HI> hereunto; that man who was more than a <HI>meer</HI> Man, was assaulted by the <HI>Cheef Devil</HI> of the <HI>lowest Hell</HI> with this Temptation in <HI>Mat.</HI> 4. 9. <HI>Fall down and worship me.</HI> But by the <HI>Sword of the Spirit</HI> our Lord Kept him off.

<P>First, There are some that make use of wick|ed <HI>Charms</HI> for the <HI>curing</HI> of <HI>Mischiefs.</HI> It is too common a thing for persons to <HI>oppose Witchcraft</HI> it <HI>self</HI> with Witchcraft.

is to <HI>destroy</HI> a <HI>Soul.</HI> These persons give them|selves to the <HI>Devils</HI> to be deliver'd from the <HI>Witches.</HI> And the people that are eas'd &amp; help|ed by such meanes, they say, do usually come to unhappy <HI>Ends.</HI> Let me say as in 2. <HI>King.</HI> 1. 3. <HI>Is there not a God in</HI> Israel, <HI>that you go to</HI> Belzebub? What? will not <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> do, but must the <HI>Black Art</HI> be used against our enemies?</P>

Secondly. There are some that make Use of wicked Charms, for the <HI>Finding of Secrets.</HI> The Lord hath told us, in <HI>Deut.</HI> 29. 29.

<P>Consider. First, There is a sort of <HI>Witchcraft</HI> charged on you. You shall as undoubtedly perish as any <HI>witch</HI> in the world, except you reform. Can you imagine that an obstinate <HI>Witch</HI> will have Admission into the <HI>Kingdom of God?</HI> Behold, &amp; be astonish't, ye unrenewed ones; as impossible it is for <HI>you</HI> to <HI>see the Lord.</HI> It is said in <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 3. <HI>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born a|gain, he cannot see the kingdom of God,</HI> That <HI>verily verily,</HI> which like a <HI>flaming Sword,</HI> stands to keep the vilest <HI>Witches</HI> out of Paradise, the <HI>same</HI> there is to keep every <HI>unbeleever</HI> out.

<P>Consider, Secondly, There is a sort of Witch|craft

<HI>come</HI> on you too. All that leave the <HI>way e|verlasting,</HI> and take a <HI>way of wickedness,</HI> they are <HI>bewitched;</HI> a grievous <HI>Witchcraft</HI> has siez'd upon them. The Apostle said to some in <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 1. <HI>O foolish</HI> Galatians, <HI>who hath</HI> bewitched <HI>you, that you should not obey the Truth?</HI> This may be an Expo|stulation as'd with all ungodly men; <HI>O foolish Transgressors, who has</HI> bewitched <HI>you?</HI> I'le tell you <HI>who:</HI> Not an <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g,</HI> but a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ust</HI> has bewitched 'em. They that are bewitched, have a marvellous va|riety of calamity upon them. One while they can't <HI>see;</HI> that is <HI>thy</HI> case; <HI>Thou</HI> art wretched, but thou canst not <HI>see</HI> it; Christ is lovely, but thou canst not <HI>see</HI> him. One while they cannot <HI>hear;</HI> that is <HI>thy</HI> case; God calls; <HI>Look unto me and be saved;</HI> but thou <HI>hearest</HI> nothing of it. A|nother while they can't <HI>stirr;</HI> that is <HI>thy</HI> case; The Lord Jesus calls, <HI>Come unto me,</HI> but thou <HI>movest</HI> not. Sometimes they are as it were, <HI>cut,</HI> &amp; <HI>prick't,</HI> and <HI>distorted</HI> in their Limbs; the very same art thou in all the <HI>Faculties</HI> of thy soul. At <HI>othertimes</HI> they are pulled into the <HI>Fire,</HI> or into the <HI>Water,</HI> or thrown with violence upon the <HI>Ground;</HI> the like happens to thy unhappy soul; it is hur|ried thither, where the <HI>fire is not quenched;</HI> it is hurried thither where they <HI>groan under the wa|ters;</HI> it is also made to <HI>pant after the dust of the earth.</HI> The <HI>Drunken</HI> man is <HI>bewitched</HI> with strong Drink; the <HI>unclean</HI> man is <HI>bewitch't</HI> with strange <HI>Flesh;</HI> the tongue of a <HI>Swearer</HI> is acted worse

than the tongue of a <HI>bewitch't</HI> man; the <HI>covetous</HI> man is hideously <HI>bewitched</HI> with <HI>Bags</HI> &amp; <HI>Lands.</HI></P>
<P>O pity thine own soul; and <HI>give no sleep to thine eyes nor s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mber to thine eye lids,</HI> until thine immortal soul be deliver'd from thy <HI>natural state.</HI> Let not <HI>Witchcraft</HI> it self be a more frightful thing to thee, than thy own present Unregene|neracy. <HI>Turn ye, turn ye, why</HI> will <HI>ye dye?</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Let not an Act of</HI> Rebellion <HI>be allowed by us.</HI> When <HI>Joseph</HI> was incited unto an <HI>Ill Act,</HI> he said, in <HI>Gen,</HI> 39. 9. <HI>How shall I do this</HI> wicked|ness <HI>and sin against God?</HI> Thus, when we are urged unto any <HI>Ill Act,</HI> Let us refuse it so, <HI>No, this is like</HI> Wicthcraft, <HI>shall I by such</HI> wickedness <HI>make my self as a</HI> Witch <HI>before the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>Three Things are to be Recommend here.</P>
<P>First. <HI>Arm</HI> yourselves against all the <HI>Devices,</HI> with which the <HI>Devils</HI> would hook you into any <HI>Rebellion</HI> against the Lord. For Rebellion against <HI>God,</HI> there will be that clause in our <HI>Indictment,</HI> They <HI>were moved by the Instigation of the</HI> Devil. Now furnish yourselves with <HI>Armour</HI> to keep off the Dint of the <HI>Devils Instigations;</HI> in short, <HI>put on the whole Armour of God.</HI> There is specially a <HI>double Care</HI> that will be of great use in your En|counters.</P>
<P>First. Use your <HI>Watch</HI> well. We read in <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 11. about, the <HI>Wiles</HI> of the <HI>Devil.</HI> When the De|vil would engage us in a <HI>Rebellion,</HI> there are cer|tain <HI>Wily Methods</HI> by which he doth accomplish
<PB N="36" REF="000486_0142_0FA6721883789C60">
it. He works more by <HI>Fraud</HI> than by <HI>Force;</HI> and there is a <HI>cryptic method</HI> by which he doth gain us over to himself. A crafty Sophistor has a <HI>three-fold Method</HI> with which he prevails upon his Auditors; and such the Method of the <HI>Devil</HI> is. <HI>Watch,</HI> First, against the <HI>Deficient</HI> method of the Devil. The Devil will show us the Sin <HI>without</HI> the <HI>Curse,</HI> the Bait <HI>without</HI> the <HI>Hook:</HI> So he saies <HI>Eat the pleasant Fruit;</HI> but he saies not, <HI>Thou shalt</HI> dye <HI>if thou do it.</HI> The Devil will re|present unto us the <HI>Difficulty</HI> of a Duty, but <HI>con|ceal</HI> the <HI>recompence</HI> of it. So he says, <HI>It's a hard thing to pray</HI> in <HI>secret every day;</HI> but he says not, <HI>Thy Fa|ther will</HI> Reward <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</HI> And he will represent un|to us the <HI>Excuse</HI> of a Sin, but <HI>conceal</HI> the <HI>Ill shape</HI> of it: So he saies, <HI>Many others have done this and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> but he saies not, <HI>God was</HI> Provoked at it. These are Tricks to be <HI>watched</HI> against.</P>
<P><HI>Watch,</HI> Secondly, against the <HI>Redundant</HI> Method of the Devil. Sometimes the devil will use a <HI>Di|gression.</HI> He will seem to give over his <HI>Intent</HI> in one thing, but make sure of his Intent in another. Such a Stratagem he uses as what <HI>Joshua</HI> took <HI>Ai</HI> withal; he <HI>retires,</HI> and so he <HI>conquers.</HI> He will make <HI>Haughtiness</HI> and <HI>Security</HI> undo the soul, that he could not make of his party for <HI>grosser Wicked|ness.</HI> Sometimes the devil will use a <HI>Commoration.</HI> He will dog a man, and bring Perswasion upon perswasion, as <HI>Delilah</HI> did with <HI>Sampson;</HI> and
<PB N="37" REF="000486_0143_0FA67219624FAD18">
like a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nuning <HI>Fencer,</HI> he <HI>repeats</HI> blow after blow, till he smite home. These are Dangers to be <HI>Watched</HI> against.</P>
<P><HI>Watch,</HI> Thirdly, against the <HI>Inverting</HI> Method of the Devil. One while the Devil will endeav|our to carry us on from <HI>Lesser</HI> sins to <HI>Greater</HI> sins. He will go to make our miscarriages like <HI>Elijah'</HI>s cloud; at first as an <HI>Hands-breadth,</HI> but anon so as to hide the whole <HI>Heaven</HI> from us. So <HI>Solomon</HI> multiplies first <HI>Horses,</HI> &amp; afterward <HI>worse</HI> things against the command of God. Another while, the Devil will decoy us from <HI>lawful</HI> things to <HI>unlawful</HI> things. Thus from a <HI>Good-husband,</HI> a man shall grow a meer <HI>Muck-worm.</HI> Now and then also, the Devil will try to spoil <HI>Good works</HI> with <HI>Ill ends:</HI> Thus the <HI>Pride</HI> of <HI>Jehu</HI> shall be swell'd by the <HI>Zeal</HI> of <HI>Jehu.</HI> He will try to make our Duties <HI>Interfere;</HI> the <HI>general Calling</HI> shall be regarded in the season of the <HI>particular,</HI> and the <HI>particular calling</HI> shall be attended in the season of the <HI>general.</HI> He will try to lead us from one <HI>Ex|treme</HI> to another; We shall be excessively <HI>merry,</HI> and ore long excessively <HI>melancholly,</HI> if we hearken to him. O keep up your <HI>Watch.</HI> Well did the Apostle say, in 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 5. 8. <HI>Be</HI> vigilant, <HI>for the</HI> Devil <HI>as a roaring lion, seeketh whom he may devour.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Use your <HI>Sword</HI> well. Tis said in <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 17. <HI>Take the</HI> Sword <HI>of the Spirit which is the</HI> Word <HI>of God.</HI> The Devil cannot stand be|fore the Brandishings of this <HI>Two-edged Sword.</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="000486_0144_0FA672199B43B898">
Our Saviour overcame the devil by making that Return, <HI>It is written,</HI> and <HI>It is written,</HI> against all his lewd attempts. Would he get you into any <HI>Rebellion?</HI> One <HI>Text</HI> well managed will make him fly before you. Would he have you be <HI>unjust?</HI> Then answer, It is written, <HI>The</HI> unrighteous <HI>shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> Would he have you be <HI>unclean?</HI> Then answer, it is written, <HI>God reserves to be punished them that walk in uncleanness.</HI> Would he have you be immoderately <HI>careful?</HI> Say then, <HI>It is</HI> written, <HI>Cast thy burden on the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Warefare</HI> is directly contrary to that <HI>Witchcraft</HI> which the Devils are daily driving or drawing us unto.</P>
<P>Secondly. Beware of <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> Rebellion against God particularly, which the <HI>Devils</HI> are <HI>most</HI> gratified withal. It is said in <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 40. <HI>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God,</HI> The <HI>unclean devils</HI> are pleased most with such things as that <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> is most <HI>grieved</HI> with. Sometimes the Devils have been forced as it were, to discover their own Inclinati|ons: thro the mouths of <HI>possessed</HI> persons, they have declar'd what was very grateful to them. The Children that have lately been under a <HI>dia|bolical Fascination</HI> in this Town, have given us diverse intimations, which we might make use|ful Observations on. I observed, that tho they had much <HI>delight in prayer</HI> when they were <HI>well;</HI> yet when they were <HI>ill,</HI> they could not endure it. The <HI>Damons</HI> would make them sing, &amp; roar, and
<PB N="39" REF="000486_0145_0FA6721A5AE4CBD0">
stop their ears, and plague them, and at last lay them for <HI>dead,</HI> if any prayer were in the Room. Whence it may be inferred, That you who can go without <HI>Prayer</HI> from day to day, do just as the <HI>Devils</HI> would have you. The Devils have an horrible <HI>Rendezvous</HI> in that <HI>Family,</HI> in that <HI>Closet,</HI> where <HI>Praye</HI> is not maintained. I observed, that tho the <HI>Word of God</HI> were their Companion &amp; <HI>Counsellor</HI> at other times, yet <HI>now</HI> they would fall into <HI>Convulsions,</HI> if one did but look into a <HI>Bible.</HI> Whence it may be suppos'd that you who <HI>read</HI> not the <HI>Scripture,</HI> for the most part every day, do humour the <HI>devils</HI> in it. The <HI>Devils</HI> are glad to see the <HI>Bibles</HI> that have <HI>dust</HI> upon them. I observed, that <HI>Haeretical,</HI> or <HI>Superstitious</HI> or <HI>Pro|fane</HI> Books, might be perused by some of them, when <HI>serious</HI> &amp; <HI>Orthodox</HI> Books would <HI>put out their Eyes.</HI> Whence it may be suggested, That you who converse much with <HI>ill</HI> books, do as the <HI>de|vils</HI> would: The Devils would willingly be where <HI>Jest-books</HI> &amp; <HI>Play-books,</HI> &amp; <HI>Romances,</HI> and <HI>Haeresies</HI> or <HI>Superstitions</HI> are made a Library. I observed, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they were exemplary for <HI>Ho|nesty</HI> &amp; <HI>sobriety,</HI> yet now their Wishes to <HI>steal</HI> &amp; <HI>be drunk,</HI> were frequently expressed; and some|times they were made very <HI>drunk</HI> tho no intox|icating <HI>Drink</HI> had bin in the least an occasion of it. Whence it may be gathered, That the <HI>Drunk|ard</HI> has a <HI>devil</HI> in him, the <HI>Stealer</HI> has a <HI>devil</HI> in him. The Devils have sport enough, when they
<PB N="40" REF="000486_0146_0FA6721B1A3F5858">
see a man Reeling in the streets; the <HI>divels</HI> are the Comrades of them that go to <HI>take what is none of their own.</HI> I observed, That tho <HI>few</HI> in the place were so <HI>diligent</HI> as <HI>they,</HI> nevertheless in their <HI>Fits</HI> they might not do any <HI>work</HI> at all. Whence it may be concluded, That of <HI>Idleness comes no good|ness.</HI> The <HI>devils</HI> are the <HI>Play-mates</HI> of them that are <HI>Gaming</HI> when they should be <HI>working.</HI> An <HI>i|dle</HI> person is a <HI>Prentice</HI> of a <HI>divel.</HI> These things have been <HI>observed;</HI> and now let these <HI>Vices</HI> be <HI>avoided.</HI> There is <HI>Witchcraft</HI> in them.</P>
<P>O that the <HI>Divels</HI> might be <HI>out-shot in their own Bow,</HI> and that these <HI>Vices</HI> might be made odious by their Affection for them.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Instead of <HI>Rebellion against</HI> God; let <HI>Obedience to</HI> God fill your lives. Make unto God that <HI>vow</HI> in <HI>psa.</HI> 116. 16. <HI>O Lord, truly I am thy ser|vant,</HI> &amp;c. And accordingly <HI>serve God with all obe|dience.</HI> Yea, <HI>often</HI> ask yourselves, <HI>What service may I do for God?</HI> And let a respect of <HI>Obedience</HI> to God make even the <HI>meanest</HI> of your Actions <HI>ho|nourable:</HI> even when you <HI>eat</HI> &amp; <HI>drink</HI> &amp; <HI>trade</HI> &amp; <HI>visit</HI> &amp; <HI>recreate</HI> yourselves, let there be some <HI>Obe|dience to God</HI> in it <HI>all.</HI> The <HI>Employments</HI> of a poor <HI>Carpenter</HI> or <HI>Shooemaker</HI> will hereby be rendred <HI>more noble things</HI> than the <HI>Victories</HI> of an <HI>Alexander</HI> or a <HI>Caesar.</HI> Not the <HI>devils</HI> but the <HI>Angels</HI> will have a most <HI>intimate Fellowship</HI> with a man <HI>thus o|bedient.</HI> Not <HI>witchcraft,</HI> but rather <HI>Inspiration</HI> will be in <HI>the man who does this, and the son of man who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">yeth hold on.</HI></P>

<P>SInce the Finishing of the History which concerns <HI>Goodwin'</HI>s Children, there has been a very wonderful Attempt made (brobably by <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> on another Fa|mily in the Town.) There is a poor Boy at this time under very terrible and amazing Circum|stances which are a <HI>Repetition</HI> of, with not much <HI>Variation</HI> from those of the Children formerly molested. The person under vehement Suspi|cion to be the Authoress this Boy's Calamities, is one that was complain'd of by those Chil|dren in <HI>their</HI> Ails. and accordingly one or two of those Children has at this time some Renew|al of their Afflictions also; which perhaps may be permitted by the Great God, not to dissap|point our Expectations of their Deliverance, but for the <HI>Detection</HI> and the <HI>Destruction</HI> of more be|longing to that hellish Knot, that has not yet pe|rished as others of the Crue has done, before the poor prayers of them that <HI>Hope in God.</HI></P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX</HEAD>
<P>THere are one or two passages in the first of our foregoing Histories, which I fore-see, (those usually no less <HI>Absurd</HI>) than <HI>Angry</HI> people) the <HI>Quakers,</HI> will <HI>come upon me with great wrath,</HI> for my writing of&punc; and the Incivilities lately shown to my Father, for a peice of one Chapter in his Book of <HI>Remar|kable Providences,</HI> by one <HI>Keith,</HI> in sort of a thing newly published at <HI>pen-silvania,</HI> have made it necessary for me, not only to <HI>explain</HI> my self, but to <HI>defend</HI> him, upon the occasion that is now before me.</P>
<P>As for what I have related concerning the strange liberty which the <HI>Devils</HI> gave unto <HI>John Goodwin's</HI> Children, to enjoy both the <HI>Writings</HI> and the <HI>Meetings</HI> of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> when offers thereof were (it may be too needlessly) made un|to

<P>One would think. That if an <HI>Historian,</HI> did but secure his <HI>Veracity</HI> from being Impeached, most of his other faults were pardonable; and so tru|ly they would be accounted, by any, besides <HI>Qua|kers,</HI> who are a people <HI>by themselves.</HI> But my Father had published a Book entituled, <HI>Illustri|ous Providences;</HI> in one part of which, he has a Narrative of several very marvellous Occurren|ces, that certain deluded and possessed <HI>Quakers,</HI> in this Countrey were concerned in.

Reader, you shall find my Fathers intro|duction to his Histories to be, <HI>All wise men that are acquainted therewith, observe the blasting re|bukes of Heaven upon the late SINGING and Dancing Quakers.</HI> And his Inference from them is, That <HI>The Quakers are</HI> SOME <HI>of them undoubtedly possessed with evil spirits;</HI> and his Conclusion is, <HI>We may, by this, judge whose servants the</HI> Singing <HI>Quakers are.</HI> Behold how carefully he has Repeated the very <HI>Distinction</HI> which this waspish man complains at the O|mission of! Besides, he had no need of making <HI>any</HI> Distinction at all. That the <HI>Quakers</HI> fall out among themselves, is but a natural Consequence of their <HI>Tempers</HI> and <HI>Errours,</HI> which cannot be otherwise than <HI>Incohaerent;</HI> and sometimes, their Credit forces them to <HI>Explode</HI> in one a|nother, what they (wish they could but) can't <HI>Excuse.</HI> Tho it seems if a Woman dress her self like a <HI>Devil,</HI> and fright some of her Sex almost out of their Lives, on a <HI>Lords Day,</HI> in

Diabolical <HI>Possession</HI> was the Thing which did <HI>dispose</HI> and <HI>encline</HI> men unto <HI>Quakerism;</HI> Their <HI>Quakerism</HI> was the <HI>proper Effect</HI> of their <HI>Possession;</HI> and not an <HI>unconcern'd Consequent.</HI> 'Tis our Logicians Fault here, that he ca|vils <HI>without making any Distinction;</HI> if he would have pleased to <HI>distinguish</HI> a little, he might have spared the pains of his tedious Ex|cursions, about <HI>Charging the</HI> innocent <HI>with the crimes of the guilty.</HI> But from such a <HI>G.

The Circumstances of it were these: This <HI>Randolph</HI> some time since, carried unto Sr. <HI>Lionel Jenkins,</HI> a

The Letter-Forger had so fool|ishly drawn it up, That <HI>Randolph</HI> could not get the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Gentleman, whom he (after his manner, that is) <HI>falsly</HI> Charged with being the <HI>Authour</HI> it, yet care was taken thereby to blast his <HI>Name:</HI> The <HI>Observator,</HI> (whom one calls <HI>The Father of Lyes</HI>) here became <HI>Nurse,</HI> &amp; printed it, with not a few scurrilous <HI>Observations</HI> on it. So that in all the Taverns and Cof|fee-houses throughout Three-Kingdoms, this innocent Person was made a Ridicule, and <HI>Bar|bados</HI> too, with other of the <HI>Lee-ward Islands,</HI> took this opportunity to spit their venome on one who had never done any thing to deserve it, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> by being (in the account of some that are <HI>Both</HI>) somewhat of a Learned and Honest man.

Besides there were in it several other Expressions, which (twas then thought no man in his <HI>Wits</HI> can dream that any without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> should have.
