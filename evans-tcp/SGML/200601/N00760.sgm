<HEAD>A Challenge to <HI>Caleb Pu&s;ey,</HI> and a Check to his Lyes &amp; Forgeries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is three years &s;ince I publi&s;hed a Book, called, <HI>News of a Trumpet, &amp;c.</HI> which has vext and gall'd the <HI>Quakers,</HI> to &s;ee their vile Errors and Here&s;ies further di&s;cover'd to the World; and &s;ome Con&s;ultations there has been among 'em as I am told, to bring forth an An&s;wer, which accordingly, I have long expected &amp; at la&s;t have met with a right Scarrilous Pamphlet, &s;igned by one <HI>Caleb Pu&s;ey, Satan's Harbinger</HI> by Title, wherein he pretends to an&s;wer [here and there a bit of] my &s;aid Book: He leaps over 4, 5 or 6 pages at a time with &s;ilence; and what he does &s;peak to, he in many places Tares my Sentences to pieces, and leaves out the &s;ub&s;tance of the Sub|ject, to make me &s;peak what I never intended [the true method of <HI>G. Fox</HI>] to render me odious. To prove this&punc; I'll cite but one Pa&s;&s;age, even the very fir&s;t Quotation he brings of mine in the top of his fir&s;t page where he leaves out the&s;e woods, <HI>According to what was made manife&s;t to them,</HI> and &s;o makes it &s;peak as he has a mind But he having &s;ucked &s;uch Wicked|ne&s;s from the founder of their Religion, he canot leave it till he cea&s;es to be a <HI>Quaker</HI></P>
<P>For great part of tho&s;e confu&s;ed &s;ayings which I quote, he &s;ends me to a <HI>Quakers</HI> Book for an an&s;wer, <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>G K</HI>'s Books while he was one with them. Alas poor man! is the <HI>Quakers</HI> cau&s;e &s;o drooping that he is forced to &s;upport it with one <HI>Quakers</HI> Book to help another, which duely con&s;idered, no ways helps him neither.</P>
<P>I have not read above half his Pamphlet, yet meet with between thirty and forty Lyes, Perver&s;ions, Forgeries, <HI>&amp;c</HI> Lyes of all &s;orts, double and &s;ingle; in order to prove this I'll
<PB N="2" REF="000916_0002_0FACA2EC6F4F1968" MS="y">
not enter his Book neither, but take that one Pa&s;&s;age, that he quotes in his Preface, where he charges me of &s;hamefully abu&s;ing a &s;aying of <HI>W. Penn</HI> in his <HI>Sandy Foundation.</HI> p. 20. There he denys that <HI>W. Penn</HI> calls Chri&s;t, as Man, <HI>The finite impotent Creature.</HI> This I charge on <HI>Caleb Pu&s;ey</HI> as a Lye; Nay, 'tis a double Lye; for he adds, that <HI>W. P.</HI> meant it of us &s;inners; whereas the only Subject that <HI>W. P.</HI> there treats on, is Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the &s;econd Per&s;on in the Trinity, whom he calls <HI>The finite &amp; impotent Creature,</HI> and denys him to have &s;atisfied the offended infinite Ju&s;tice of his Father for mans &s;in, for that very rea&s;on, and calls it an ab&s;urdity &s;o to believe or affirm. I have this Book of <HI>W. Penns</HI> by me, and I do de&s;ire and intreat all modrate People that want to be &s;atisfied in the Truth of this to come and &s;ee it; for I de&s;ign to keep the Book for that purpo&s;e, to di&s;cover the ba&s;ene&s;s of this <HI>Caleb Pu&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P>But above all, I admire at <HI>W. Penn,</HI> being a Man of Wit, Parts and Learning, that he &s;hould be &s;o deeply mired in the Bog of Quakeri&s;m, as to &s;uffer, nay, countenance &s;uch palp|able Lyes to be publi&s;hed in print, of his Writings, it being not only his place but in his Power to have prevented it; cer|tainly if he believes he &s;hall hereafter give account of his Steward&s;hip to Almighty God, he mu&s;t needs believe this thing will ri&s;e in Judgment again&s;t him, which is pupo&s;ely done to deceive and delude poor ignorant People. &mdash; But as for <HI>C. Pu&s;ey</HI> I have no rea&s;on to expect better friuts from him, for he is not hone&s;t in Morals, he unju&s;tly with-holds part of an E&s;tate from the Executor of <HI>Thomas C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>; but be it known to him I can force him &s;o far to be hone&s;t, provided his Brethren are no Judges in the ca&s;e. However he's a fit Tool to &s;erve the <HI>Quakers,</HI> becau&s;e he can lye &amp; abu&s;e men without &s;hame. But to the matter.</P>
<P>Let this one pa&s;&s;age in his Preface, which he e&s;teems a capital Crime again&s;t me [by repeating it divers times over
<PB N="3" REF="000916_0003_0FACA2ED266B6F18">
and over in his Book and calls it an <HI>abominable Lye</HI>] be the Rule and Touch &s;tone of Tryal between us in the ca&s;e, and to try the re&s;t of his wordy &s;tuff in his Book. Therefore I here challenge him in the face of the World to let us chu&s;e four, &s;ix or more judicious Men to judge of this Pa&s;&s;age, and if they find me wrong, and he right, I'll be bound to print what &s;ort of Condemnation <HI>Caleb Pu&s;ey</HI> &s;hall a&s;&s;ign. But if they find me right and he wrong, he &s;hall be bound to print what Condemnation I &s;hall a&s;&s;ign him.</P>
<P>Now with this Mill-&s;tone, through Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will I grind this Miller, and by this Token it &s;hall be known to the World that his ca&s;e is Naught, that he makes Lyes the <HI>Quakers</HI> Refuge, and dare not refer it to any but his own Party, who are his encouragers in this wicked Work, and at who&s;e Charge he prints, and not at his own; for <HI>New-Rome</HI> has a Publick Stock to carry on her under-ground De&s;igns; but tis otherwi&s;e with me, I mu&s;t print at my own Charge. Therefore till he accepts my Challenge, this is all the An&s;wer I think to give him. Mean time, my Book does its Service appointed by divine Providence in <HI>England,</HI> the Land of my Nativity, where it has been Re-printed and &s;pread for the benefit of my Coun|try-men in Defyance of Cart loads of his <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">y Sophi&s;ms, Lyes</HI> and <HI>Trumpery,</HI> which will prevail on none but tho&s;e they have already Conquered.</P>

<HEAD>Adverti&s;ement.</HEAD>
<P>&rindx; The Reader is de&s;ired to take Notice that this Paper was writ above a year ago, and has lain in the Printers hands ever &s;ince, which has cau&s;ed the <HI>Quakers</HI> to glory over the Author, as &s;uppo&s;ing he dur&s;t not make any Return to their Lyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But be it known to them that Truth &s;eeks no Corners, nor does he, but offers to meet them before any Impartial Auditory But think he is not under any Ob|ligation to trace them in all their Serpentine turnings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> until they an&s;wer this fair and rea&s;onable Challenge above offered to <HI>Caleb Pu&s;ey.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Po&s;t-&s;cript.</HEAD>
<P>AS to <HI>John Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d</HI> he brings long &s;toryes in the Po&s;t&s;cript to prove me a Lyar, when as what he brings is a con|firming of the &s;ub&s;tance of that which I charge him with, <HI>viz..</HI> That he was Sheriff and Preacher, a thing unpre&s;iden|tial, and that <HI>Roberts</HI> was a &s;ufferer by his taking the &s;aid <HI>Roberts</HI> his goods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I'll propo&s;e this to <HI>J. Wood,</HI> Let half a dozen of his friends relate a &s;tory, that contains many circum&s;tances, and I'll engage they &s;hall every one differ in relating one and the &s;ame &s;tory. And &s;hall I therefore call them Lyars, tho' I know <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">? No, I hope I have more charity.</P>
<P>But what need I argue thus? for I have publi&s;hed nothing of <HI>John Wood</HI> that he accu&s;es me for, but what I had and &s;till have by me in writing, &s;ent to me under the hands of the Widdow <HI>Roberts,</HI> and one of her Neighbours, which al&s;o well agrees with what &s;he and her &s;ick Husband related to me when they reque&s;ted me to print it in my Almanack&punc; and I believe when &s;he again &s;ees the writings, &s;he will &s;o recollect her &s;elf as not to eat her words, as I perceive &s;ome Preachers have endeavour'd to force her to do. So that <HI>J. W.</HI> wrongs me in calling me Lyar, as will be found by all who think it worth while to view the &s;aid Writings in my hands.</P>
