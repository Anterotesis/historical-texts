It is indeed a noble Prize, and always rewards its adorers with la&s;ting and ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings. And although &s;o few are found to be Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors hereof, yet the want of it &s;tains

And the <HI>Quakers</HI> in that time, that exceeded in Life and Conver&s;ation, being much more civilized, and given to Sobriety; this their good Conver&s;ation prevailed upon me, wherefore I joyned my &s;elf with them.

<P>Now long before this, and before I joyn'd my &s;elf with them in Communion <HI>J.

<P>This, I and my Friend <HI>T. Rutter</HI> ha|ving a &s;ight of, we accounted it Bla&s;|phemous, and reproachful to Chri&s;t Je&s;us. But however, we laboured to inform J. W. in meekne&s;s, of his danger|ous Error, as well as Bla&s;phemy, while

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> This being laid down for a Principle, it ought to be proved by expre&s;s Te&s;timony of Scripture, or el&s;e no man is bound to be|lieve it, <HI>viz.</HI> That Angels do a&s;&s;ume Bodies in which they appear, and that they do not appear in their own proper Bodies.

Then if they do borrow Bodies, it mu&s;t be &s;ome ones Body, that belongs either to the quick or dead. If to the quick, the Per&s;on who&s;e Body the Angel doth occupy, would be &s;en&s;ible of the &s;aid occupation, and then it would not only be a borrowing or a&s;&s;uming the Body, but the Soul al&s;o, and con&s;equently the Per&s;on would give a relation of it, to &s;ome of his Friends or others, by which means we might have more certain knowledge of &s;uch a thing. But of &s;uch a thing we never heard. 2. If to the Dead, it mu&s;t be a Body that hath been newly Dead, or one that hath laid &s;ome time in the Grave. As to the fir&s;t, <HI>one newly Dead,</HI> this would be a Miracle &s;een and beheld of men, becau&s;e the dead Bodies of men are never ca&s;t out of the &s;ight of the living, until they are entoombed in the Grave, and then we &s;hould have more knowledge of it.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Containing twelve Objections that are brought again&s;t the former Doctrine of Chri&s;ts dying, as he was God, as truly as Man. With the An&s;wers to each.</HEAD>
<P>BUt again&s;t this Doctrine, That the Death of Chri&s;t did as truly relate to his divine as Humane Nature, there are divers Object|ions brought.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. By <HI>W. P</HI> &amp; <HI>J. W. That Suffer|ings are acts of Impotency and Weakne&s;s, there|fore none but impotent, weak and finite Creatures can &s;uffer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> This Objection is not only fal&s;e in it &s;elf, but al&s;o highly bla&s;phemous and inju|rious to Chri&s;t Je&s;us, rendring him an impo|tent, weak and fini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Creature, who is an Omnipotent and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nfinite Creator&punc;</P>

and keep the eternal Word; which is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> G. K. is very uncertain about Para|di&s;e, what it is, &s;ometimes he thinks it is Chri&s;t, at another time the third Heaven; and then again, the new Earth.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the Bea&s;ts of the field were the fallen Angels, then <HI>Adam</HI> was to give Names to the fallen Angels, and al&s;o they were formed out of the ground, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.19.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the Trees of the Garden were <HI>divine Perfections</HI> and <HI>Vertues,</HI> then divine Perfections and Vertues &s;pring out of the Ground, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.9.</P>
<P N="4">4. Again, if the Tree of knowledge was Gods &s;evere Ju&s;tice and Wrath in Chri&s;t (as G.

<P N="5">5. If the Soul of Man receives not its being by humane Generation (as G. K &s;aith) then by the &s;ame parity of Rea&s;on one might &s;ay, the Body doth not neither. But if G. K de|nyes this con&s;equence, and will have it that the Body doth, but the Soul doth not. Then I may argue, according to G. K. that Bodies are capable of generating and propogating without Souls. But G. K. being a Philo&s;o|pher, might have remembered better this Rule in Natural Philo&s;ophy, <HI>viz. Every like begets its like.</HI> Now according to the Rule, if a Body only be begotten, then it was only a Body that did beget it, in which Gignation the Soul was not active or concerned, and then dead Bodies may multiply and increa&s;e Bodies as well as live ones.
