<P>Very particularly;</P>
<P><HI>Iu&s;tification</HI> is one thing, in the <HI>Healing</HI> of a Soul.

<P><PB N="19" REF="000926_0019_0FACA34D2B40B930"><HI>Sanctification</HI> is another thing in the <HI>Healing</HI> of the Soul. A Soul is made <HI>Healthy</HI> when 'tis made <HI>Holy.</HI> In <HI>Sanctifying</HI> a Soul, the Lord fulfils what is written, Jer. 30.17. <HI>I will Re|&s;tore Health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy Wounds.</HI> The Soul is <HI>Viciated</HI> by Sin.

<P>And then, in the <HI>Healing</HI> of the Soul, there is <HI>Con&s;olation</HI> al&s;o.

<P>Fir&s;t. A man mu&s;t be <HI>Sen&s;ible</HI> of his own <HI>Sinfulne&s;s.</HI> A <HI>Sen&s;ible Sick</HI> Sin|ner, is One that &s;ees him&s;elf a <HI>Sinner,</HI> and bemoans him&s;elf like him, Luk. 18.13. <HI>God be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI> He &s;ees him&s;elf a Sinner by <HI>Nature.</HI> He &s;ayes with the <HI>Sen&s;ible</HI> P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>Behold, I was &s;hapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother Conceive me.</HI> He &s;ees him&s;elf a Sinner by <HI>Practice.</HI> He &s;ayes with the <HI>Sen&s;ible</HI> People, <HI>My Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions are multiplied before God, and my Sins testify again&s;t me.</HI> Yea, he &s;ees him&s;elf Di&s;tempered and En|dangered, by <HI>Innumerable Sins</HI>: he &s;ayes with him, P&s;al. 40.12. <HI>Innume|rable Evils have compa&s;&s;ed me about, mine Iniquities have taken hold upon me.</HI> A Soul <HI>Sen&s;ibly Sick</HI> is no <HI>Self-Justici|ary.</HI> He Cryes out, <HI>Lord, I am Vile: I am a Sinful Wretch; my best, my fair|e&s;t and fine&s;t Works, are but &s;plendid Sins&punc; my Holy Things are Iniquities, I am a meer Lump of Sin; there dwells no Good thing in me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="000926_0023_0FACA3518BCF48F0">Secondly.

A Soul <HI>Sen&s;ibly Sick,</HI> &s;ees the <HI>Death,</HI> whereto he is by <HI>Sin</HI> become obnoxious. There is a Terror &s;truck into &s;uch a Soul, by &s;uch a Thought as That, Rom. 6.23. <HI>The wages of Sin is Death.</HI> Such a Soul, is ca&s;t into an Agony of Con&s;ternation and A|&s;toni&s;hment at the Condition, which it is by Sin brought into.

<P>Thirdly; A man mu&s;t be <HI>Sen&s;ible,</HI> that <HI>Sin</HI> is indeed the <HI>Wor&s;t &s;ort of Evil.</HI> He mu&s;t call it, as 'tis call'd, Jer. 44.4. <HI>The Abominable thing.</HI> That man is indeed <HI>Sick,</HI> who feels it a wor&s;e thing to be <HI>Sick,</HI> than to be <HI>Poor,</HI> and <HI>Mean</HI>&punc; and labour under ten thou&s;and other Inconveniences. A Soul <HI>Sen&s;ibly Sick,</HI> looks upon <HI>Sin</HI> as the wor&s;t mi&s;ery imaginable: There appears nothing &s;o mi&s;erable unto &s;uch a Soul, as to ly under <HI>Sin.</HI> As 'tis &s;aid of one, Heb. 11.25. <HI>He Cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer Affliction, with the People of God, than to enjoy the Plea&s;ures of Sin</HI>; So, &s;uch a Soul counts the mo&s;t <HI>Plea&s;ant Sin,</HI> more bitter, than the mo&s;t <HI>bitter Affliction.</HI> Yea, the Sin which was once the chief Plea&s;ure of &s;uch a Soul, now becomes <HI>more Bitter than Death.</HI> A <HI>Sin-Sick</HI> Soul, makes Ejulations and Exclamations of this Importance; <HI>What a forlorn Creature am I!

<P>Fourthly. A man mu&s;t be <HI>Sen&s;ible,</HI> that he cannot be his <HI>own Saviour <HI>from Sin</HI>,</HI> or the <HI>Healer</HI> of his own Soul.
