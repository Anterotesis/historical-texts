<P>THough I mu&s;t own my &s;elf in|capable to write upon this Subject, any thing worthy to be expo&s;ed to the publick view, &s;ince my Education hath not given me tho&s;e Advantages of Stile and Compo&s;iti|on, altogether nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch an Un|dertaking: Yet con&s;idering I had the mi&s;erable Experience of what hath been barbarou&s;ly inflicted on me, with many others my Fellow Sufferers, who are &s;till groaning under the mo&s;t in&s;upportable Mi&s;eries; I thought my &s;elf bound in Duty to publi&s;h, as well as I can expre&s;s it, what was plain Matter of Fact, to the end it might more powerfully move your

Compa&s;&s;ion, and excite you Charity for the Redemption of tho&s;e who remain to this Day under their Egyptian Task-ma|&s;ters. A full Account of which you have in the en&s;uing Relation, wherein I have made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s, to give you a clear and particular view of the mo&s;t remark|able Pa&s;&s;ages that happened during the unfortunate time of my Confinement a|mong tho&s;e barbarous Salvages. I &s;hall offer nothing but Truths, which ten Years Sufferings have made me too long ac|quainted with. We were not only ba|ni&s;hed from our Native Country, (being Engli&s;h men, and my &s;elf born in <HI>Ratcliff</HI> Pari&s;h in <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>) but from all the Spiri|tual as well as Temporal Comforts. We were confin'd among&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e Re|ligion was compo&s;ed of Cruelty, who&s;e Cu&s;toms were Extravagant, and who&s;e U&s;ages almo&s;t intolerable; what from the hardne&s;s of our Labours, and the coar&s;ne&s;s of our Provi&s;ions, we were re|duced to the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Extremities, which cau&s;ed us to think and contrive all ways and means to procure our de&s;ired Liberties; which con&s;idering how nar|rowly we were watch'd, and how clo&s;e|ly
<PB N="7" REF="000905_0007_0FAC9D90A4FB7010">
kept, was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be ef+fected.</P>
<P>I need not mention here how I made my E&s;cape, with two others of my Com|panions, &s;ince I have given you an exact Account of it, with all its Circum&s;tances, in the following Relation, with what happened afterwards to the Per&s;on who was in&s;trumental in our happy Delive|rance, for which we are in Duty bound, during the whole Cour&s;e of our Lives, to own the particular Providence of God, to who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Protection we owe our pre&s;ent Safety.</P>
<P>The chiefe&s;t De&s;ign of my publi&s;hing this Book, is to caution all Seafaring men, who&s;e particular Voyages carry them into the <HI>Streights,</HI> that they take all po&s;&s;ible care not to be trapan'd by the&s;e &s;ubtile Pirates, who infe&s;t tho&s;e Coa&s;ts, where we unfortunately fell into their Hands; and that reflecting on the Barbarities they mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer from tho&s;e mercile&s;s Enemies, it will be their &s;ure&s;t Intere&s;t to defend them&s;elves to the ut|mo&s;t of their power, even to the la&s;t Extremity, Death it &s;elf being to be pre|ferred before that, or any other Slavery.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="000905_0008_0FAC9D923158BC78">Another Motive is, That I hope what I write, may be a means to procure Li|berty for the&s;e my Country men, who are now labouring under the mo&s;t pre&s;|&s;ing Mi&s;eries, and who would be very &s;erviceable at this time again&s;t the Com|mon Enemy; who&s;e deplorable Conditi+on hath been not long &s;ince publi&s;hed and recommended in a Brief to be con|tinued for two whole Years, as follow|eth.</P>

<P>In the Year 1680, the Engli&s;h Cap|tives that were under this inhuman Ty|rant, the Emperor of <HI>Morocco,</HI> bewailing their own Condition, making moan to one another, and praying to God for Deliverance, at la&s;t concluded among&s;t them&s;elves to draw a Petition to our late King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> giving him to under&s;tand their mi&s;erable Condition in this Captivity: which being done, the King took it into Con&s;ideration, and &s;ent over Captain <HI>Francis Nichol&s;on</HI>; who being come, and &s;eeing the Cruel Bondage his poor Coun|try-men were in, their hard Labour and cruel Fare, having therewith many cruel Stripes and Blows, he could not but la|ment their Condition, and prayed God that he might come to &s;ome Compo&s;ition with that Helli&s;h Tyrant for them. The Emperor at the &s;ame time &s;ent for the Shack, or Chief over all the Jews in his
<PB N="17" REF="000905_0013_0FAC9D95E5408B78">
Dominion, and bid him build a Town, which would be better for the Jews than the Cane Hou&s;es, (his Name was <HI>Abra|ham Memoran</HI>) and at that time Captain <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> made an Agreement with the Emperor for the Chri&s;tians, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> were delivered him up, the Emperor wi&s;hing them a good Jour|ney to <HI>Tangier</HI>; the Captain took them out of the Town that Night, which the Shack of the Jews hearing of, that came to the Emperor, telling him, if he would let him have the Chri&s;tians to build the Jews Town, he would give him as much Money as the Captain had agreed with him for: the Emperor bid him come a|gain in the Morning. Then the Shack or Chief of the Jews went immediately home to his Hou&s;e, and got a Pre&s;ent ready, and &s;ent it in to the Emperor's Wife, that &s;he might &s;olicite the Empe|ror for him: which having received, &s;he &s;ent word back by the Eunuchs, that &s;he would endeavour to prevail with him, which &s;he did. And the next Morning he &s;poke again to the Emperor, who im|mediately &s;ent out his Negroes to drive back the Chri&s;tians, which were hurried
<PB N="18" REF="000905_0014_0FAC9D96A37291D8">
again to their Works in a cruel manner. The <HI>Moors</HI> of his City <HI>Macquene&s;s</HI> &s;eeing that, cur&s;ed the Jews for doing it. But the Captain could in no wi&s;e prevail with this grievous Tyrant the Emperor, (notwith&s;tanding the Captain had done what in him lay to have got the Chri&s;ti|ans away) who &s;aid he would not part with them till the Town was fini&s;hed. So they went to work with great Chops, and Baskets to carry Earth in; and the Negroes were &s;et over them to keep them at it from Morning to Night. When the Town was fini&s;hed, he put in his Negroes: but the Cur&s;e of the Jews fell upon their own Governour, his Mi&s;|chief returned on his own Head, as will &s;hortly be &s;hewn. In the mean time the poor Chri&s;tians were grievou&s;ly hur|ried and puni&s;hed by tho&s;e Helli&s;h Ne|groes at the Command of this wicked and inhumane Tyrant the Emperor, and had &s;carce time to take any Nouri&s;hment, or eat any of their bad Bread that was allowed them, but with a great many Threats, Stripes and Blows by the Ne|groes, bidding them turn <HI>Moors.</HI> In which condition they prayed to God to

pre&s;erve them in their Faith; in which, through his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they remained con&s;tant.</P>
<P>Some time after Captain <HI>Nichol&s;on</HI> be|ing gone from thence, the Emperor laid Siege again&s;t a City called <HI>Tarradant,</HI> in the South part of that Dominion, being kept by a King who&s;e Name was <HI>Mully Hammet</HI>: and having been there a con&s;i|derable time&punc; he &s;ent to the chief of the Jews, to bring him up &s;ome Goods which he wanted from <HI>Macquene&s;s.</HI> When he had gotten Mules, and carried them to the place where the Emperor was in Camp, the Vice Roy's Son being there with the Emperor, went to the &s;aid Shack or chief of the Jews, and de&s;ired him to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with &s;ome Money, and his Father would repay him, when he, <HI>viz.</HI> the Chief of the Jews, &s;hould return to <HI>Macquene&s;s.</HI> He told him his Father owed him already &s;everal thou&s;and Du|cats, and would not pay him any, for as yet he could get none from him: and &s;aid moreover, if he &s;hould die and pe|ri&s;h, he would not lend him a penny. Of which pa&s;&s;ages he acquainted his Fa|ther, writing a Letter thereof to <HI>Macque|ne&s;s.</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="000905_0016_0FAC9D9828A4E840">
Afterwards the Chief of the Jews went to <HI>Macquene&s;s</HI> to the Vice Roy cal|led <HI>Coyd Birry,</HI> and told him he had ac|quainted the Emperor of the Care he had in his Ab&s;ence of his Ca&s;tle and Bu&s;ine&s;s; he taking little notice of him, but returning him Thanks for his Kind|ne&s;s he went away. But <HI>Coyd Birry</HI> the Governour (being &s;o called in the Em|perors Ab&s;ence) ordered one of his chief Negroes in a little time after to go and take &s;uch a Hor&s;e which he de&s;crib|ed to him, and go to the place where the Country People kept their Market, to &s;ee if he could find the &s;aid Chief of the Jews; and if he &s;aw him, take little notice of him; but if he had an oppor|tunity, watch as he went home to his Hou&s;e, and kill him. The Negroe did as he was ordered, and e&s;pying the Shack, or Chief of the Jews, going home to his Hou&s;e, in a Road which lay through a parcel of Olive Trees, the Negro came to him, pretending Kindne&s;s to him, be|ing glad to &s;ee him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and riding by his &s;ide along on Hor&s;eback, &s;pied his opportunity very diligently, &s;o &s;purred his Hor&s;e over him, rode upon him and
<PB N="21" REF="000905_0017_0FAC9D98E0A92138">
trode out his Brains. Word thereof was quickly carried to the Vice-Roy, that the Chief of the Jews was killed, at which he &s;eemed to be &s;orry, that the People might take no notice thereof, and ac|quainted the Emperor therewith, and had made &s;earch, but knew not who had done it. The Emperor &s;ent him word back, that if he did not find out who did it, he would cut off his Head, and ordered the &s;aid Vice Roy to put the Governour of the Jews Son to be the Chief in his &s;tead; but the old Jew was &s;oon forgotten by the Emperor.</P>
<P>When the Emperor had laid Siege &s;ome Years again&s;t <HI>Tarradant,</HI> and could not take it, he returned home to <HI>Macque|ne&s;s.</HI> After he had been at home a cer|tain time, he went again&s;t that City with about 70000 Hor&s;e and Foot, and decla|red that if any Chri&s;tians knew what belonged to mining he would &s;et them to work; and if they took the Town, they &s;hould have their Liberty; &s;o four Engli&s;h Men undertook the Work, the <HI>Moors</HI> digged, and they gave Directions. The Mines being fini&s;hed, and 30 Bar|rels of Engli&s;h Powder rowled into the
<PB N="22" REF="000905_0018_0FAC9D9A90D2E668">
Mine, and a Train laid; the Chri&s;tian that fired it was blown up: and a Breach was made in the Ca&s;tle-Wall, but they could not enter, their Enemies fired &s;o thick upon them, killing a great many of <HI>Mully I&s;hmael</HI> the Emperor's Men. They mined again under the <HI>Burges,</HI> or &s;mall Forts: after Powder was put in, and a Train laid, he that gave fire to it, had his Arm &s;truck off, the <HI>Burg</HI> was blown up with the People therein. And the Emperor <HI>Mully I&s;hmael</HI> coming to view the Breach, and being told by the People, the Chri&s;tian had lo&s;t his Arm, he ordered his chiefe&s;t Doctor to take care and heal him; for in ca&s;e he did not &s;ee to him carefully, he &s;hould lo&s;e his Head. <HI>Mully Hammet</HI> got up his People to the Breach, and kept out the Emperor and his Forces, that they could not enter. Afterwards <HI>Mully Hammet</HI> went out of his Ca&s;tle with a &s;mall Guard, and meeting with &s;ome of the Emperor's Scouts, one of them knowing <HI>Mully Hammet,</HI> cock'd his Piece and &s;hot him to death: Then <HI>Mully Ham|met</HI>'s Guard fought with <HI>Mully I&s;hmael</HI>'s Scouts, and there were &s;everal killed on
<PB N="23" REF="000905_0019_0FAC9D9B20FC32D8">
both &s;ides. Some of <HI>Mully Hammet</HI>'s Guards retired into the Ca&s;tle, and ac|quainted the chiefe&s;t of them that were in the Ca&s;tle, that their King was killed: pre&s;ently they proclaimed <HI>Mulla Rann</HI> (being the chiefe&s;t of the Governours in <HI>Mully Hammet</HI>'s time) to be their King. Which News being carried to the Emperor by his Scouts, he enquired who had killed <HI>Mully Hammet?</HI> they told him one of the Scouts, which he &s;ent pre&s;ent|ly for by a Me&s;&s;enger, and bid him ac|quaint him that he &s;hould have a good Reward for killing him; he being brought before the Emperor, expecting a great Reward for &s;o doing, after he had examin'd him, he rewarded him with calling him Dog, and &s;aid he &s;hould die for killing <HI>Mully Hammet,</HI> and im|mediately cau&s;ed him to be made fa&s;t to a Mule's Tail, and &s;o had him dragged through the Camp, and ordered one to go before and declare, that it was for killing of <HI>Mully Hammet</HI>; he was dragged &s;o long till his Body was torn in pieces; after that he had him put in a place where the Country People u&s;ed to come into the Camp. <HI>Mully Ran</HI> kept the

And coming on a cer|tain time, (as he u&s;es con&s;tantly to do) although it rained very fa&s;t, as he was going into one of the Hou&s;es, the Ma&s;t|er Workman and his A&s;&s;i&s;tants going <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> hoi&s;t up a piece of Timber, the Rope that held it broke, and the Timber fell, with which he &s;uddenly retired back, and &s;ent for the Ma&s;ter-Workman in great Pa&s;&s;ion, threatning him for taking no better care: he told him he was as careful as he could be for his life in

So I enquired of him where he lived? he an&s;wered, at a place called <HI>A&s;&s;imore,</HI> which is not far from the Chri&s;tian Garri&s;on; and he &s;aid, he would tru&s;t to the Bene|volence of the Governour of that place, provided I would &s;peak to the &s;aid Go+vernour for a Gratuity for him, when we &s;hould arrive there. I told him I &s;hould be wor&s;e than a Jew, if I did not do that; and they them&s;elves count the Jews

the wor&s;t and fal&s;e&s;t of all People. Then I asked him in what time we &s;hould pro|vide for our Journey? he &s;aid, as &s;oon as I could find convenient opportunity; &amp; I farther prevailed with him to take in two more Engli&s;h-men along with us, who&s;e Names were <HI>Tri&s;tram Bryan,</HI> born in <HI>Plymouth;</HI> and <HI>Edward Tucker,</HI> who came from <HI>New England.</HI> And in five days time after we were fitted with a &s;mall quantity of Bread for the Journey, &s;uppo&s;ing we might accompli&s;h our Jour|ney in ten nights time, for we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity hide our &s;elves in the Day for fear of being di&s;covered; yet we found it difficult enough to perform it in two and twenty days, in which time we were put to great Hard&s;hips and Nece&s;&s;ities on the way. The Particulars are as follow.</P>
<P>On the 26<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> 1692, in the Evening, we &s;et forward from <HI>Macquene&s;s,</HI> and travelled as far as we could that Night in great fear of being pur&s;ued, with our <HI>Moor</HI> to direct us in the way, know|ing that if they had found us, we had been killed, if not burnt, which would have been the <HI>Moor</HI>'s Lot had we been taken: towards day we had a great Ri|ver
<PB N="69" REF="000905_0061_0FAC9DBB62B9C540">
to pa&s;s; when we were got over, we found a &s;mall Coppi&s;e or Wood, where we re&s;ted the Day following, being the 27<HI>th.</HI> In the Evening when the Sun was &s;et, our Guide was forward to be going, not knowing how the Event would prove, and I had much ado to per&s;wade him from going before 'twas dark. When we came into the Road out of the Wood we met ten <HI>Moors,</HI> and Mules and A&s;&s;es laden with Goods for the Emperor, being Iron, which they had taken from one <HI>Sa|vage,</HI> an Engli&s;h Ma&s;ter that came from <HI>Bilboa</HI>; &s;o we followed our Guide the <HI>Moor,</HI> who gave them the time of the Night, and they him likewi&s;e; &amp; &s;o we pa&s;&s;ed that time without any further trou|ble, they &s;uppo&s;ing us to be <HI>Moors,</HI> being we had on their &s;ort of Apparrel. So we travelled that Night, making what ha&s;te we could, and &s;till in great fear, le&s;t we &s;hould have been di&s;covered by <HI>Moors</HI>: when we re&s;ted&punc; it was towards Day, in &s;ome Brambles or Bu&s;hes, &s;eeing them pa&s;s along by us, driving of Sheep and Bullocks; but through Mercy they did not &s;ee us. And the next Night, being the 28<HI>th,</HI> we travelled all Night; and
<PB N="70" REF="000905_0062_0FAC9DBC4AF0D7A0">
when Day appeared, we could not find a convenient place to lodg in, which we &s;ought for; and about Sun-ri&s;ing we found a place betwixt two Mountains where were Holes made with the Winter Rains coming off the Hills near a Path|way, to which we made, and e&s;pied &s;e|veral <HI>Moors</HI> who went along the Road, that had Mules and A&s;&s;es loaden with Iron, who &s;aw us not. Some part of the Day we &s;lept; and the <HI>Moor</HI> and I watcht; in which time the <HI>Moor</HI> gathered Palm, and made a Sling, to &s;ling Stones at Lions and other wild Bea&s;ts that ap|peared.</P>
<P>So in the Evening, after Sun&s;et, (be|ing the 29<HI>th</HI>) we travelled till we came to a River-&s;ide, where were a great parcel of <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Mules</HI> a baiting, that had Bail Goods, which the <HI>Sally Moors</HI> had taken in Prizes, to carry to the Emperor at <HI>Macquene&s;s</HI>; who &s;trictly enquired of our <HI>Moor,</HI> from whence we came, and whither we were going? He made an&s;|wer, To <HI>Salley,</HI> and came from <HI>Macquene&s;s,</HI> and &s;o our <HI>Moor</HI> bad them Goodnight; and we travelled on (without further en|quiry) along the River-&s;ide before we
<PB N="71" REF="000905_0063_0FAC9DBDA9078658">
could get over. When we were over, there were a great many Bramble bu&s;hes and Ru&s;h-bu&s;hes; and our <HI>Moor</HI> feared there were Lions in that Place, &s;o we made what ha&s;te we could up a Hill, on the top of which was a great Plain; and being very thir&s;ty, we travelled on a good way further, and heard a noi&s;e of Frogs and Toads; to which Place we came, and found a &s;tanding Water, which &s;tunk; however we drank thereof to &s;tay our Thir&s;t, and 'twas &s;weet to us: and &s;o went on till we found a ruined Ca&s;tle, which had formerly belonged to the <HI>Portugues,</HI> at which our <HI>Moor</HI> would fain have re&s;ted; but I told him there might happen to be <HI>Moors</HI> there, becau&s;e they u&s;ually re&s;ted in &s;uch Places in the Night. So we came to a place where grew a great parcel of high Weeds, and there we re&s;ted that Day.</P>
<P>The 30<HI>th</HI> at Night, after Sun &s;et, we &s;et forwards; but were very thir&s;ty, the Sun haveing &s;hone hot upon us that Day, having lain without &s;helter, only the Weeds. I asked our <HI>Moor,</HI> how long it would be e're we could find any Water? He &s;aid, A little further there was a &s;mall
<PB N="72" REF="000905_0064_0FAC9DBE661BE7B8">
River; but we thought it a long way to it, our Throats being &s;o parch'd with Drought; &s;o we drank Water, and eat a little Bread, which did greatly refre&s;h us; and we went forward till near break of Day, where we re&s;ted in &s;ome Weeds till about two in the Afternoon; at which time the three Women di&s;turbed us two or three times, but &s;aw not our Faces. So we three went forward, and our <HI>Moor</HI> &s;tood, and enquired of them the way to <HI>Salley.</HI> Then the Women asked from whence we came? Who an&s;wered, From <HI>Tapholet,</HI> which was a City in that Coun|try. They further asked, if he had lain in that place all Night? and asked what they were that were with him? He told them, Three of his Neighbours, and that they had laid there all Night, being Strangers. They &s;aid, It was a wonder that the Lions had not de&s;troyed us, there being &s;o many in that place, they devou|red &s;ome of their Cattle, almo&s;t every Night; and they told him it was about four Leagus to <HI>Sally.</HI></P>
<P>After Sun-&s;et (<HI>July</HI> 1.) we travelled till we came to a Wood, where the <HI>Moor</HI> would have had us to re&s;t; but &s;eeing of
<PB N="73" REF="000905_0065_0FAC9DBF25B13738">
Lights which the Country People had in their Tents, and hearing a Lion roan thereabouts, we went further, and came to a ruined Tower, where was a good Spring of Water; we drank and refre&s;h|ed our &s;elves, but dur&s;t not &s;tay for fear of <HI>Moors</HI> being in that place; and going a little farther, we came into a Valley, where was a Hole the Winter Rains had made, there we re&s;ted; and after the Sun was ri&s;en, two <HI>Moors</HI> came to cut Palm: At which I awaked our <HI>Moor,</HI> who &s;poke to them, and gave them the time of Day, and they likewi&s;e to him. They enquired of him from whence he came, and whither he was going? He told them, he came from beyond <HI>Tapho|let,</HI> and was going to vi&s;it a great Saint at a Town called <HI>Tem&s;nah</HI>; and asked further, if there were none with him? He an&s;wered, there were three more&punc; They asked, if we had lain there all Night? He &s;aid, we had; They &s;aid, it was to be wondred that the Lions had not devoured us; and came to look at us where we lay, &s;peaking <HI>Arabick</HI>; but the <HI>Moor</HI> told them, we could not &s;peak that <HI>Lingua</HI>; and we were covered all o|ver
<PB N="74" REF="000905_0066_0FAC9DBFE2BE5150">
with our white Blankets, being &s;uch as the <HI>Moors</HI> commonly wear. So they went away and left us, telling us. We did well in going to vi&s;it the Saint. So we got up, and e&s;pying a parcel of Bu&s;h|es a little di&s;tance off, we removed thi|ther, le&s;t the two <HI>Moors</HI> &s;hould have informed of us at <HI>Sally,</HI> &amp; &s;o have come back to the place and found us. The Bu&s;h where we were hid, was near a River-&s;ide, but we dur&s;t not go to drink thereat, by rea&s;on of People which pa&s;&s;ed to and fro there by us all-day long.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 2. After Sun-&s;et, we attempted to go over the River; but it being &s;o &s;trong a Stream, and deep, we could not pa&s;s over it: And in our going a great way further up the River-&s;ide, there happened to be &s;everal of the <HI>Moors</HI>; yet being Night, they &s;aw us not, &s;ave only one Man of the Natives, which had tied up a bundle of Canes fa&s;t together to pa&s;s over the River with them; to whom our <HI>Moor</HI> gave the time of the Night; and he an&s;wering with the like to us, we parted: and going higher up, we found a place not &s;o deep as the other part of the River; &s;o got over, and travelled up
<PB N="75" REF="000905_0067_0FAC9DC0A364D638">
a Hill on the other &s;ide, where we found &s;ome Bu&s;hes, and there we re&s;ted, and our <HI>Moor</HI> lay on the out-&s;ide of them. In the Morning when the Sun was ri&s;en, came by us two <HI>Moors</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> A&s;&s;es, who &s;aid one to the other, it was won|der the Lions had not devoured that Man, meaning our <HI>Moor,</HI> who they &s;aw lying by the &s;ide of the Bu&s;hes.</P>
<P>On the third In&s;tant, after the Sun was &s;et, we &s;et forward, endeavouring to get to the Sea-&s;ide: but there being &s;eve|ral People in the way, watching with their Dogs to keep the wild Bea&s;ts from their Gardens; which we hearing, were fain to flee further from them: &s;o we travelled a little further&punc; and re&s;ted a|mong &s;ome Ru&s;hes.</P>
<P>The next Night, being the 4<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Ju|ly,</HI> we travelled after Sun &s;etting as far as we could, being weary and faint, and re&s;ted.</P>
<P>On the 5<HI>th</HI>; on which Day after Sun was &s;et, we &s;et forward and travelled till we came to a place where was a &s;tand|ing Water, being thereto led by a noi&s;e of Frogs; which although the Water &s;tunk, yet drinking thereof, it was &s;weet

to us; with that, and a little Bread, we were much refre&s;hed; but at this time our Bread was gone, &s;o we travelled a little further, and re&s;ted.</P>
<P>The 6<HI>th</HI> In&s;tant, after Sun-&s;et, we went forward, and di&s;covered a great many Lights which the Natives had in their Tents where they lodg: So we parted a while one from another, to find out the Roads. At length I came to a place where the Country People u&s;e to go to Market, where we again met together; and travelling a while, we heard &s;ome Dogs as I thought, did &s;cent us; and near that place we met with a Lion ly|ing by the way-&s;ide; which the <HI>Moor</HI> &s;eeing, before he rou&s;ed, he &s;truck him fair over the Head. So the Lion roared at him, and followed us half a mile or more; but our <HI>Moor</HI> kept &s;linging of Stones at him &s;o fa&s;t, that he left us. Then we came to a Valley, where was a Wood on each &s;ide: When Day appeared, we re&s;ted in the Wood, ha|ving no Bread to &s;u&s;tain us; but we dur&s;t not enter the Wood till it was Day light, for fear of the Lions: We then found a piece of Pot in the Wood,
<PB N="77" REF="000905_0069_0FAC9DC22970DF18">
with which our <HI>Moor</HI> brought us &s;ome Water out of the Valley; for we dur&s;t not fetch it our &s;elves, le&s;t the People &s;aw us: &s;o when the <HI>Moor</HI> had brought us a pot full of Water, (but in the mean time we were lamenting our &s;ad Condition for want of Bread, having then no Su&s;tenance but Palm-Berries&punc; Gra&s;s and Weeds, and any thing we could eat, which was &s;weet to us) he &s;aid, in his own Language, God was great. So went from us about the &s;pace of four Hours; in which time he fold his Sa&s;h, and bought us a &s;mall quantity of Bread (about a pound and an half) therewith, and brought us a little of it, which we ate; and he fetch'd us a little more Water in the Pot: After we had eaten and drank of the Water, we went to &s;leep, two of us watching.</P>
<P>On the 7<HI>th,</HI> after Sun &s;et, we travel|led on; and the <HI>Moor</HI> &s;lung Stones, whil&s;t we pa&s;&s;ed through the Wood, le&s;t there &s;hould be Lions lurking therea|bouts: having refre&s;hed our &s;elves with the Bread and Water, we re&s;ted among&s;t &s;ome Brambles, but could find no more Water that Night.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="000905_0070_0FAC9DC2E1F4B408">Then on the 8<HI>th</HI> Day at Night we came to another Wood, in which we travelled a great way, and kept two of us awake to watch again&s;t Lions and o|ther wild Bea&s;ts.</P>

<P>The 10<HI>th,</HI> after Sun &s;etting, we went till we came to an Hill of Rocks; at the bottom whereof we found a Spring of Water, and drinking thereof, we were greatly refre&s;hed, and there was a little River, from which we went, till we came to &s;ome Trees or Bu&s;hes, and there re&s;ted.</P>
<P>About eight a Clock in the Morning, <HI>July</HI> 11.

the North &s;ide of the River, till we came to a place where Canes grew, and there we re&s;ted by the River-&s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 14 After it was Day, our <HI>Moor</HI> went to &s;ee his Family which dwelt there in that Town.

<P>On the 15<HI>th</HI> In&s;tant, when the Sun was ri&s;en, I de&s;ired our <HI>Moor</HI> to go and enquire of the People, where we might pa&s;s over the River?

So our <HI>Moor</HI> went about a League further in the Country, where he &s;aw a Man and a Woman up|on a Mule cro&s;&s;ing the River, and mar|ked the place with &s;ome Stones, that we might find it, and &s;o returned to us, and

<P><HI>July</HI> 16. After Sun &s;etting we travelled about a Mile further, where we &s;aw a Town, that our <HI>Moor</HI> &s;aid was a Saint's Town, to which the People, that were not able to pay their Taxes to the Em|peror, fled for Refuge.</P>

Souldiers made an&s;wer to me, and asked what we were?

the Morning ordered his Clerk to write a couple of Letters, and gave them to the <HI>Moor,</HI> with forty pieces of Eight for bringing us thither, &s;aying, If he did bring the two Portugue&s;s, he would give him as much more as &s;hould maintain him and his Family as long as he lived.

<P>About three Weeks after, a Portugue&s;e Man of War came into that Garri&s;on, to fetch about 1800 Souldiers off from thence: So I de&s;ired of the Governour we might go aboard with them: Which he was willing, and in four days after we had been aboard, mo&s;t of the Souldi|ers
