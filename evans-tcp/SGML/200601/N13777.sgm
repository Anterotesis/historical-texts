<OPENER><DATELINE>IN COUNCIL, <DATE>January 19. 1781.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inva&s;ion of our country by the enemy at the clo&s;e of the late &s;e&s;&s;ion of A&s;&s;embly, their pu&s;hing immediately to this place, the di&s;per&s;ion of the publick papers, which for the purpo&s;e of &s;aving them nece&s;&s;arily took place, and the injury done at the printing office, have been &s;o many cau&s;es operating unfortunately to the delay of tran&s;mitting you tho&s;e acts of Assembly which required immediate execution. The principal of the&s;e, the law for re|cruiting our army, having been framed on the fact that the militia of the &s;everal counties would be in quiet at home, has been peculiarly retarded by the nece&s;&s;ity we were under of calling militia from almo&s;t every county. We have &s;eized the earliest moment po&s;&s;ible for di&s;charging tho&s;e of as many counties as could be, in order that this important law may be put into a cour&s;e of execution. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> you. Your duty till the new levies &s;hall be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to march from the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> take up the &s;ubject from that period only. New London, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, Winche&s;ter, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and Che&s;terfield court-hou&s;e, are appointed for the rendezvous of the levies You are at liberty to &s;end them to any of the&s;e places, but as they are ultimately to proceed to Che&s;ter|field court hou&s;e, I would recommend to you to con&s;ider this in your choice of rendezvous. At each of the&s;e places an officer will attend from the 10th day of March next for the purpo&s;e of receiving them. You will &s;end them under the charge of an officer, who being enabled by the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it&s;elf to provide means of tran&s;portation, is hereby authorized to apply for &s;ub&s;i&s;tance to any commi&s;&s;ary, commi&s;&s;ioner, or other per&s;on, principal or &s;ubordinate, having publick pro|vi&s;ions in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and on failure to obtain <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ufficiency in that way, he is to impre&s;s it, giving certificates to the per&s;ons from whom he &s;hall impre&s;s, and returning to the Auditors a li&s;t of &s;uch certificates, &s;pecifying the party's name, article, price, and date. Let this officer be furni&s;hed with a proper certificate from you that he is appointed to this duty, which he is to &s;end to the Auditors together with his li&s;t, that they may be &s;atisfied of his authority.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e you two blank calenders, in which you will in&s;ert the names and de&s;criptions of your levies delivered to the officer who will be appointed by us to receive them as directed by the act of A&s;&s;embly; the one of the&s;e he will &s;ign and leave as a voucher to you, the other &s;hould be &s;igned by your&s;elf or the officer delivering the men for you, and left in the hands of the receiving officer.</P>
<P>On the clo&s;e of your draught I mu&s;t de&s;ire a return of your militia, and as the law obliges the Captains to make exact returns to you at every general mu&s;ter, I am to require that from the&s;e you make always an exact return to the Execu|tive, that &s;o we may have a con&s;tant knowledge of the actual &s;trength of your militia. Notwith&s;tanding the requi&s;i|tion I made you &s;ix months ago for a return of your militia, you have not been plea&s;ed to comply with it, an inatten|tion which cannot be ju&s;tified on any principle of military &s;ubordination, and which cannot again pa&s;s unnoticed.</P>
<P>A very dangerous practice having been introduced by the enemy of laying under paroles the whole country, through which they are at any time able to march, and thereby attempting to di&s;arm its future oppo&s;ition, has rendered it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for government to take up and reprobate the idea, that any citizen may thus cancel his duties to his country. I inclo&s;e you a number of proclamations on this &s;ubject, and de&s;ire that you will put one into the hands of every Captain in your county, with orders to read it at the head of his company at every private mu&s;ter during the pre&s;ent year.</P>
<P>Such is the pre&s;ent a&s;pect of the enemy towards this country, that no fore&s;ight can predict the moment at which your militia will be called into active duty. Let me exhort you therefore, and through you, your officers and men, to con&s;ider that moment as if now come, that every man, who has or can procure a gun, have it in&s;tantly put into the be&s;t order, a bayonet fitted to it, a bayonet be&s;t cartouch box, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with its &s;trap, tomahawk, blanket, and knap|&s;ack Some of the&s;e articles are nece&s;&s;ary for his own &s;afety, and &s;ome for his health and comfort. The con&s;tant ex|hau&s;ture of the publick &s;tock of the&s;e articles, by calls from all quarters, renders it vain for the militia to expect to be &s;upplied from thence, when they come into the field, and nothing is &s;o ea&s;y as for every man to have them prepared while quiet and at home. The cartouch box with a leathern <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ap, a wooden canteen with its &s;trap, and a knap&s;ack of thick linen (the better if painted) are what may be made in almo&s;t any mans family, and there are few neighbourhoods which do not afford artificers equal to the repair of a firelock, and furni&s;hing it with a bayonet. Let me then again en|treat you Sir, not only to give out in general orders to your Captains, that the&s;e preparations be in&s;tantly made, but to &s;ee your&s;elf as far as po&s;&s;ible that your orders be carried into execution. The &s;oldiers them&s;elves will thank you when, &s;eparated from dome&s;tick accommodation, they find them&s;elves, through your attention to their happine&s;s, provided with conveniencies which will admini&s;ter to their f<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t wants When you order them into &s;ervice, it will be proper that you order them to bring the&s;e things with them. Con&s;ider al&s;o the &s;ending a waggon with every &s;eventy five men as a &s;tanding rule, and that the officer who attends to lay in provi&s;ions for the men on their road, always return to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> a li&s;t of the certificates he gives, &s;tating the name, article, price, and date, in &s;eperate columns. The&s;e are circum&s;tances always nece&s;&s;ary, and as in the fir&s;t hurry of an inva&s;ion, when it is nece&s;&s;ary to write an infinity of letters and give a multiplicity of orde<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s, it is not practicable then to enter into the&s;e details, I wi&s;h now to lay them down to you as &s;tanding rules, which may &s;ave the nece&s;&s;ity of repeating them in future on every &s;pecial occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t reque&s;t you to make diligent enquiry and &s;earch through your county for any publick arms or accoutrements <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> individuals, to collect them together, and make report of them to me.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am with great re&s;pect, Sir,
Your mo&s;t obedient And mo&s;t humble &s;ervant.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
