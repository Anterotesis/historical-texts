<HEAD>A SERMON, On occa&s;ion of the Execution of four Criminals.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>DEUTERONOMY, XIX c. 13 v.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Thine Eye &s;hall not pity him, but thou &s;hall put away the guilt of innocent blood from</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>that it may go well with thee.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is well known to this great A&s;&s;embly, wherefore it is that the&s;e poor pri&s;oners have been brought under a &s;entence of con|demnation, this day to be executed upon them, namely, their having murderou&s;ly &s;hed innocent blood. The pa&s;&s;age now read, I apprehend, therefore, is a fit theme to di&s;|cour&s;e upon, upon this &s;olemn and melan|cholly
<PB N="6" REF="015872_0004_0F9AD979C7BA64C0">
occa&s;ion. And I the rather fixed up|on this &s;ubject, that &s;o, if the ble&s;&s;ing of God may go along with what may be offered from it, the minds of the&s;e unhappy per&s;ons may be deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the crime which has thrown them into the hands of ju&s;tice, and expo&s;ed them to the fatal &s;troke of it, yea, and that having the heinou&s;ne&s;s of it &s;et before us, we may be all filled with an utter dete&s;tation at, and abhorrence of it, avoid it, and all ap|proaches to it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t man that died out of this apo&s;|tate world, was drove out of it by the hand of violence. You know the in&s;tance I refer to, Cain's imbruing his hands in the innocent blood of his brother. Of the old world in the days of Noah, it is &s;aid, that <HI>the earth was filled with violence:</HI> Violence of this kind, among other in&s;tances. Nor have there been wanting in&s;tances in every age of this kind, until now. It is a crime that is peculiarly &s;oul and black in the e&s;teem of God, and at which he expre&s;&s;es his angry re&s;entments in his word. This appears in &s;ome mea&s;ure from the chapter before us, and from the words I at fir&s;t read, as well as in abundance of other pa&s;&s;ages in &s;acred writ.</P>
<P>Now it is plain from my text that <HI>&s;hedding innocent blood</HI> contracts guilt. It is plain al|&s;o
<PB N="7" REF="015872_0005_0F9AD97A88147B40">
that it is the will of God, that this <HI>guilt</HI> &s;hould be <HI>put away.</HI> And,</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> We may &s;ee the &s;pecial rea&s;on why God would have it put away, expre&s;&s;ed in the latter part of the ver&s;e. <HI>"That it may go well with thee."</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour with all convenient bre|vity to &s;peak to the&s;e &s;everal heads, in doing which, I &s;hall be led to take notice of the true import of what is expre&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t clau&s;e of the ver&s;e, <HI>"thine eye &s;halt not pity him,"</HI> him that is guilty of innocent blood.</P>
<P>The whole will be followed with &s;ome application &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place then, &s;hedding innocent blood contracts guilt.</P>
<P>This is the language of the in&s;pired pa&s;&s;age we are upon. <HI>"Thou &s;halt put away the guilt of innocent blood."</HI> Now guilt nece&s;&s;a|rily refers to &s;ome law authoritatively enact|ed, which is broken or violated. For <HI>where there is no law there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and con&s;equently no guilt contracted. But that there is a law violated in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, is plain beyond all di&s;pute. Among the laws or commandments given at Mount Sinai, this is one&mdash;<HI>Thou &s;halt not kill.</HI> And that this is a law that was not peculiar to I&s;rael of old, but a &s;tanding law in God's moral kingdom, is evident from this, that our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour
<PB N="8" REF="015872_0006_0F9AD97BC96FB9C8">
has adopted it into his own in&s;titution. Says he to the young ruler, with whom at a cer|tain time he entered into a conference, <HI>Thou &s;halt do no murder,</HI> Matt. xix, 18. I would ob&s;erve here, that there are &s;ome occa&s;ions that may happen in which taking away the lives of others may not be con&s;idered as violations of this commandment we have mentioned. Thus a per&s;on may kill ano|ther by what is called chance or accident, without the lea&s;t evil intention or &s;o much as a thought of &s;uch a thing. Now it is plain from what is &s;aid in the chapter in which is our text, that he who thus accident|ally kills another is without guilt even in the &s;ight of God. Ver&s;e 4, 5, <HI>Who&s;o killeth his neighbour ignorantly whom he hated not in time pa&s;t, as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a &s;troke with the ax to cut the tree, and the head &s;lippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour that be die, he &s;hall live,</HI> as is plainly expre&s;&s;ed in the former part of the fourth ver&s;e.</P>
<P>So again, it may be &s;aid; if a man is a&s;|&s;aulted, and is thereby brought into danger of his life, it is ju&s;t that he &s;hould &s;tand up|on his defence; and if in nece&s;&s;ary &s;elf de|fence he kills his antagoni&s;t, he is not chargeable with murder in the eye of God's
<PB N="9" REF="015872_0007_0F9AD97C0F04BDE8">
law; he only that is &s;lain has done the wrong, and his blood mu&s;t be upon his own head. However, I would ob&s;erve, that a per&s;on of a &s;ober, good mind, will have &s;uch a regard for the life of his mo&s;t inveterate enemy, that he will be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uffer ve|ry great wrongs, rather than proceed to &s;uch an extremity in &s;elf-defence, as to take away his life.</P>
<P>Again. If war is lawful, e&s;pecially a de|fen&s;ive one, it cannot then be &s;aid, that if e|nemies are &s;lain in it, that tho&s;e that &s;lay them are chargeable with &s;hedding innocent blood. The aggre&s;&s;ors in a war are only chargeable with all the fatal con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>Once more, I would &s;ay, that when cri|minals and malefactors are put to death, as is this day to be the ca&s;e, with the&s;e unhap|py per&s;ons before us, by the &s;word of public ju&s;tice, there is no violation of the law of God, forbidding murder. I go upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the crimes &s;uch are charge|able with, are de&s;erving of death. And no one &s;urely will call it in que&s;tion, whether the <HI>&s;hedding innocent blood</HI> is not thus de&s;erving. Having ob&s;erved the&s;e things, I would pro|ceed and &s;ay, that the law of God, forbiding the taking away the lives of others, intends that they &s;hall not be taken away without a ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e. This rule extends
<PB N="10" REF="015872_0008_0F9AD97CB26BC6A0">
to per&s;ons of all ranks and conditions, to the meane&s;t &s;lave, as well as to the per&s;on of high degree: For both the one and the other equally partake of the human nature, and are therefore equally valuable, and have an equal right to the continuation of life, &s;o long as the Lord of life &s;ees fit.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion now is, when is it that this crime of murder is committed? I an&s;wer, when from a &s;ettled principle of hatred, ma|lice or revenge, per&s;ons take away the lives of others. Such are in the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e, murderers, both in the eye of God and of civil &s;ociety. Or, if the killing another is not from a &s;ettled principle of hat|red, malice or revenge, but owing to a &s;ud|den tran&s;port of rage or fury, this, al&s;o is mur|der, even allowing that it is not &s;o in &s;uch a gro&s;s &s;en&s;e, as when it is done with premedi|tation and malice afore-thought. As men ought not to indulge to wrath, bitterne&s;s and fury, &s;o if they are by the&s;e corrupt, malig|nant pa&s;&s;ions led to &s;hed the blood of any of their fellow creatures, they may not expect that this will avail as any ju&s;t excu&s;e, either before God or man. "It is (&s;ays an author) evidently unfit that life &s;hould be continually expo&s;ed to hazard from the turbulent, ungo|verned wrath of man. This would be to &s;ub|ject quiet and peaceable members of &s;ociety to the greate&s;t hard&s;hips, by con&s;tructively
<PB N="11" REF="015872_0009_0F9AD97D713D8B88">
giving encouragement to angry men to vent their fury upon them." Wrath and fury may not be indulged upon the principles of rea&s;on or the Bible. And in vain mu&s;t it be to plead one crime in excu&s;e for another, e&s;pecially, &s;uch an heinous one, as that we are &s;peaking of, &s;hedding the blood of others.</P>
<P>Now this, as I have &s;aid, contracts guilt, and guilt of the deepe&s;t and blacke&s;t dye. God has forbidden it with the highe&s;t autho|rity. His expre&s;s law is violated, to &s;ay no|thing of the laws of civil &s;ociety. And &s;uch therefore, &s;tand guilty both before God and man; at once and ab&s;olutely before God, who&s;e knowledge is infallible: And before man, &s;ometimes immediately after the perpe|tration of the fact, but, however, after a legal proce&s;s.</P>
<P>But without any further enlargement, I go on to ob&s;erve in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place: It is the will of God, that this guilt &s;hould be put away.</P>
<P>How is it to be put away? I an&s;wer, by inflicting the penalty of the law upon the breakers of it. And this penalty, it is plain, by the appointment of God him&s;elf, is nothing le&s;s than the de&s;truction of their temporal lives. That is, a &s;tanding, perpetual law of God, publi&s;hed to the new world from <HI>Noah.</HI> Gene&s;is ix. 5, 6. <HI>At the hand of every man's brother, will I require the life of man. Who&s;o &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be
<PB N="12" REF="015872_0010_0F9AD97E4512DBD0">
&s;hed,"</HI> &s;hall be &s;o by the magi&s;trate, or who|ever is appointed or authori&s;ed to be the aven|ger of blood "Before the flood (as one ob|&s;erves) God took the puni&s;hment of murder into his own hands, as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Cain,</HI> but &s;ince, he committed this judgment to men; to ma&s;ters of families fir&s;t, and afterwards to the heads of countries." There is no language in which the intention of God as to tho&s;e that are guilty of &s;hedding blood, can be more plain and expre&s;s than this, as in the pa&s;&s;age now mentioned, as well as in many others. Accordingly, we have it, <HI>Numbers</HI> xxxv. 30. <HI>Who&s;o killeth any per&s;on, the murderer &s;hall be put to death;</HI> it follows, <HI>"Ye &s;hall take no &s;a|tisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death;"</HI> or as in the margin, faulty to die, <HI>"but he &s;hall &s;urely be put to death."</HI> We have the like appointment of the holy God in the ca&s;e, <HI>Proverbs</HI> xxviii. 17, <HI>A man that doth violence to the blood of any per&s;on, &s;hall flee to the pit, let no man &s;tay him."</HI> This is the &s;tanding, unrepealable law of the ma|je&s;ty of Heaven. And con&s;onant hereto, this is the &s;tanding law of all civil &s;ocieties. But not to dwell upon this:</P>
<P>Now this penalty annexed to the divine law re&s;pecting &s;hedding innocent blood, requiring blood for blood, &s;hews it to be a very heinous crime; a crime of the fir&s;t magnitude. And that it is &s;o, appears from a variety of circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="13" REF="015872_0011_0F9AD97EF6CFCCA0">
which I may but briefly hint at: Be|fore which, I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that <HI>Bar|barians,</HI> who never were acquainted with the revelation of God, nor of his mind in this ca&s;e, have looked upon murder as a &s;hocking and heinous crime, expo&s;ing the perpetrators of it to &s;ome &s;ignal vengeance of the deity. We have an example of this in the ca&s;e of the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul:</HI> When he landed at the i&s;land <HI>Melita,</HI> after his &s;hipwreck, it happened that a <HI>viper</HI> fa&s;tened upon his hand, a venom|ous bea&s;t, who&s;e bite is certain and &s;udden death, it is &s;aid, the barbarians thus remarked upon it, <HI>No doubt this man is a murderer, whom though he hath e&s;caped the dangers of the &s;ea, yet vengeance &s;uffereth not to live,</HI> Acts xxviii, 4. "And, as one ob&s;erves, &s;hould murderers e&s;cape the vengeance of man, they &s;carce ever after enjoy them&s;elves, or take comfort in life; their hearts mi&s;give them; their thoughts trouble them; their guilty fears perpetually haunt them; and &s;ometimes for the &s;ake of peace within, they have been as it were, forced to reveal their own wickedne&s;s, choo&s;ing ra|ther to die by the hands of ju&s;tice, than to drag on life under the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations of a continually &s;elf-condemned con&s;cience."</P>
<P>Having ob&s;erved this, I go on to &s;ay that God having made this crime ab&s;olutely pu|ni&s;hable with death, &s;peaks it to be a hein|ous crime indeed. And it is &s;o, in the fir&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="015872_0012_0F9AD97FDC31BE30">
place, in re&s;pect of the great inju&s;tice done to him who&s;e blood is &s;hed. Indeed there is no in&s;tance of inju&s;tice equal to this. Men may by lawle&s;s violence be turned out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their goods and properties, they may be many ways injured in their names and in their bodies too; but all this is no ways equal to what it is to be deprived of life; for this is the foundation of all other enjoyments, and when this is de&s;troyed all others fail of cour&s;e. And then, many inju|ries that men meet with may be repaired; their properties may be re&s;tored, their cha|racters vindicated, &amp;c. but when life is tak|en away, there is no &s;uch thing as re&s;toring this, it is irrecoverably gone. It is therefore the mo&s;t aggravated in&s;tance of inju&s;tice that can be done to a man. Be&s;ides all which, the &s;piritual and everla&s;ting happine&s;s of the man, may be very nearly concerned, which &s;hows the high and aggravated inju&s;tice of it. What mu&s;t be the ca&s;e of a wicked man, who is &s;uddenly deprived of life by the hand of violence? While life remained he had a &s;pace for repentance, an opportunity to make his peace with God, was in a capacity of ob|taining pardon, and &s;ecuring his everla&s;ting happine&s;s; but in being drove out of the world, all opportunity and capacity herefor, wholly cea&s;es. And it is to be feared, that many, who have fell &s;uch &s;acrifices, have
<PB N="15" REF="015872_0013_0F9AD983344A3330">
at once gone to mi&s;ery. So that, in this ca&s;e, the immortal &s;oul is in a &s;en&s;e de&s;troyed, as well as the body. What in&s;tance of inju&s;|tice can there any ways be, equal to that, which proves the occa&s;ion of a man's lo&s;ing his &s;oul forever, which is more worth than the whole world, as is evident, among other in&s;tances, from the ine&s;timable price that was paid for its redemption, even the preci|ous blood of God's only begotten, and dearly beloved &s;on, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I might al&s;o ob&s;erve upon the great in|ju&s;tice of it, from the con&s;ideration of the lo&s;s that is &s;u&s;tained, by tho&s;e nearly related or connected, and by the &s;ociety to which &s;uch belong. But pa&s;&s;ing over this, I go on to &s;ay, in the next place. That murder is a mo&s;t heinous and aggravated &s;in, in re|gard of the great impiety of it towards God.</P>
<P>He is the author of men's lives, and it is his &s;ole prerogative to di&s;po&s;e of them. His wi&s;dom as well as goodne&s;s is concerned in continuing men in the enjoyment of their lives. It is, we may be &s;ure, to an&s;wer &s;ome valuable and important ends, in his general plan of government; and as he clearly &s;een into all the relations, dependencies and con|nections of things, &s;o he perfectly knows how to accompli&s;h the&s;e ends, let the characters of men, in the moral and religious &s;en&s;e, be as they will, good or bad. By violently de|&s;troying
<PB N="16" REF="015872_0014_0F9AD98472CF08C8">
the life of a man, <HI>God is</HI> (as one expre&s;&s;es it) <HI>virtually robbed of a creature whom his hands have formed, yea, of a &s;er|vant and &s;ubject from whom he might have received, a revenue of honour and &s;ervice.</HI> So that it is impiou&s;ly to break in upon the wi&s;e plan that God has laid. And then, al&s;o, it is to be con&s;idered, that man is the no|ble&s;t work of God, in this lower world; he was at fir&s;t made after the image of God, and notwith&s;tanding his apo&s;tacy, does, in &s;ome re&s;pects, &s;till bear this image; accordingly, when God expre&s;&s;ly declares, after the flood, that murder is a capital crime, to be puni&s;h|ed with death, as in the pa&s;&s;age I mentioned before, this rea&s;on is a&s;&s;igned <HI>for in the image of God made he man.</HI> Upon which one thus notes: <HI>Such remains of God's image are &s;till upon fallen man, as that he who unju&s;tly kills a man, defaceth the image of God, and doth di&s;honour to him.</HI></P>
<P>Once more. The heinou&s;ne&s;s of this crime, appears al&s;o in this, that it excludes the perpetrators of it from the kingdom of Heaven, and expo&s;es them to eternal death. Says the apo&s;tle, 1 John, iii, 15. <HI>No murder|er hath eternal life.</HI> He is far from having that principle in him which leads to eternal life. How can this be when he is under the influence of &s;uch diabolical principles as have been mentioned, wrath, hatred, malice, re|venge,
<PB N="17" REF="015872_0015_0F9AD9850536F218">
&amp;c. principles that will operate in &s;uch a dreadful manner as to put him upon embruing his hands in the blood of a fellow creature. <HI>Murderers,</HI> are expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid by our Saviour, to <HI>be of their father the Devil, who</HI> (as he &s;ays) <HI>was a murderer from the be|ginning,</HI> John viii, 44. <HI>He is</HI> (&s;ays one up|on it) <HI>an enemy to life, becau&s;e God is the God of life, and life is the happine&s;s of man. He was man's tempter to that &s;in, which brought death into the world, and &s;o he was in effect the murderer of all mankind.</HI> And as he him|&s;elf has no lot or portion in Heaven, where is the enjoyment of eternal life, &s;o neither &s;hall have any of his children, but &s;hall be puni&s;hed with eternal death. Accordingly, the apo&s;tle John, among other heinous tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors, mentions MURDERERS, <HI>who &s;hall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brim&s;tone, which is the &s;econd death.</HI> Rev. xxi. 8. But this, I would ju&s;t &s;ay, that the apo&s;tle &s;peaks with re&s;pect to &s;uch, goes upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that they are not brought to true repentance: For, it may be ob&s;erved here, that as black a crime as mur|der is, it may be repented of, and in virtue of the great atonement by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, be par|doned by God. This is &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;|ed by the apo&s;tle to the Hebrews, Chap. xii. 24. <HI>Je&s;us the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of &s;prinkling, which &s;peaketh
<PB N="18" REF="015872_0016_0F9AD985B05F0E80">
better things than the blood of</HI> Abel. Tho blood of <HI>Abel</HI> cried for vengeance: But the blood of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the lamb &s;lain, cries for mer|cy. And being <HI>&s;prinkled</HI> therewith, as the phra&s;e here is, murderers may obtain pardon from the hands of God. But unle&s;s this is the ca&s;e, the dreadful threatening we ju&s;t mentioned, will be executed upon them. I &s;hall only add here that pa&s;&s;age in Rev. xxii. 15, which refers to tho&s;e that are finally im|penitent. <HI>But without,</HI> i.e. the heavenly city, mentioned ver&s;e preceding, <HI>are dogs and &s;or|cerers, and whoremongers and MURDER|ERS.</HI></P>
<P>From all now that has been &s;aid, does it not appear, what a heinous crime murder is? Its being puni&s;hable with death, by the expre&s;s appointment of the God of Heaven, as well as by the laws of civil &s;ociety, &s;peaks it to be &s;o. It is only in this way, that <HI>the guilt of innocent blood can be put away,</HI> as the language is in my text. Nor may any, with|out great offence to God, interpo&s;e to prevent it, or ward off the &s;troke of civil ju&s;tice. <HI>Thine eye &s;hall not pity him,</HI> &s;ays the text. Does this mean, that we &s;hould be hard hearted towards &s;uch who have committed this crime? That we &s;hould &s;et a&s;ide even common humanity? Shut up our bowels of compa&s;&s;ion towards them? Be rancorous, bitter and wrathful in our di&s;po&s;itions to|wards
<PB N="19" REF="015872_0017_0F9AD986882F2378">
them? No, it does not mean this&mdash;Tho&s;e that are in di&s;tre&s;s are objects of pity; and ingenuous minds will have the feelings of humanity towards them. While they de|te&s;t the crime, will pity and compa&s;&s;ionate the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed criminal. And the religion of the compa&s;&s;ionate Je&s;us, will powerfully lead to this. And this humane, chri&s;tian principle, will put them upon every kind office towards them, to pray earne&s;tly for them, and u&s;e all their be&s;t endeavours, that &s;o their &s;ouls may he &s;aved from death, and that they may ob|tain a part in the everla&s;ting &s;alvation of the heavenly world, which through the abound|ing grace of God and of the go&s;pel, they are capable of. But when it is &s;aid in my text, <HI>thine eye &s;hall not pity him,</HI> it intends, that thou &s;halt not <HI>&s;o</HI> pity him, as to prevent ju&s;tice tak|ing place upon him. That judges and jurors upon &s;ufficient evidence of their guilt, &s;hould, agreable to the &s;olemn obligation lying upon them to be faithful, declare them guilty, and pronounce upon them the &s;entence which the law of God and man has provided in the ca&s;e, and, that all who are properly authori|&s;ed thereto, &s;ee that it be put into execution. All this is con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t tender emotions of heart towards poor criminals, and the mo&s;t fervent wi&s;hes and prayers for their everla&s;ting happine&s;s.

the expre&s;s, peremptory orders of the God of Heaven.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s on now to the la&s;t head propo&s;ed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>To con&s;ider the &s;pecial rea&s;on, why God would have <HI>the guilt of innocent blood put away&mdash;That it may go well with thee.</HI></P>
<P>It intimates, that if the guilt of blood is not put away, it will be very di&s;plea&s;ing to God, and expo&s;e the land to di&s;tre&s;&s;ing judgments. It would &s;peak a general approbation and con&s;ent to &s;o heinous a wickedne&s;s, and &s;o the guilt would lie, not only on the imme|diate actors and their accomplices, but on the public, and nothing then could be expected, but God's te&s;tifying his anger in mo&s;t awful ways. We may &s;ee at large in <HI>Deuter.</HI> xxi. what particular care was taken to put away the guilt of innocent blood, even when <HI>he</HI> that &s;hed it, was not found out. After the devoted heifer was &s;lain, their hands were to be wa&s;hed over it, denoting their innocence, to which the P&s;almi&s;t no doubt refers, xxvi. 6. <HI>I will wa&s;h mine hands in innocency.</HI> And then the people of I&s;rael are brought in as addre&s;&s;ing the divine maje&s;ty, ver&s;e 8. <HI>Be merciful, O Lord unto thy people I&s;rael, whom thou ha&s;t redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of I&s;rael's charge. And the blood &s;hall be forgiven them.</HI> Should not this guilt be put away in the manner that has been &s;aid, the whole land would be defiled. So we read
<PB N="21" REF="015872_0019_0F9AD9880185FBF0">
<HI>Numbers</HI> xxxv. 33. <HI>For blood it defileth the land, and the land it cannot be clean&s;ed of the blood that is &s;hed therein,</HI> or as the marginal reading is, there can be no expiation for the land, <HI>but by the blood of him that &s;hed it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If,</HI> as one notes upon it, <HI>&s;uch e&s;cape puni&s;h|ment from men, they that &s;uffer them to e&s;cape will have a great deal to an&s;wer for, and God will not, however, &s;uffer them to e&s;cape his righteous judgment. If a man would give all the &s;ub&s;tance of his hou&s;e to the judges, to the country, or to the avenger of blood to atone for his crime, it mu&s;t utterly be contemned,"</HI> that &s;o God may not be provoked utterly to de&s;troy that land, but that it <HI>may go well with it,</HI> that it may be under his &s;pecial care and ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed the &s;everal heads I at fir&s;t mentioned, as offering them&s;elves from the text. And upon &s;o extraordinary an oc|ca&s;ion, I apprehend, as I hinted in the begin|ning, that it would be &s;uitable to offer that which might &s;erve to give people a full view of the crime of murder, the exceeding hein|ou&s;ne&s;s of it, and the fatal con&s;equences of it, and, as I &s;aid, to impre&s;s the minds of the&s;e poor pri&s;oners with a deep and pungent &s;en&s;e of the crime, for which they are this day to &s;uffer the penalty annexed to the law of God and man.</P>
<P>To the&s;e poor pri&s;oners. I would now par|ticularly &s;peak&mdash;And as this is the <HI>la&s;t</HI> &s;er|mon
<PB N="22" REF="015872_0020_0F9AD988C94D0AE0">
you will ever hear, I hope you will carefully attend to what may be now &s;poken to you, by one who has had much to do with you &s;ince your confinement, and hopes he has a true de&s;ire for your immortal intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>I would, in the fir&s;t place, &s;peak to <HI>Buch|anan, Brooks</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>If you have attended to what has been &s;aid in this di&s;cour&s;e, you mu&s;t be led to &s;ee, that your arraignment, condemnation and execu|tion, may not be attributed to the malignant pa&s;&s;ions of hatred, malevolence, bitterne&s;s and wrath. You mu&s;t needs be &s;en&s;ible that at the court, all was fairne&s;s, candor and impar|tiality, both as to judges and jurors, and every advantage to vindicate your innocency, had you been innocent:&mdash;Had this appeared, it would have been matter of &s;atisfaction to the court, the numerous a&s;&s;embly, and to the whole community: But you were found guil|ty, and received &s;entence accordingly; not in rage and fury, but with chri&s;tian tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion. And why was the fatal &s;en|tence pronounced? I an&s;wer, becau&s;e ju&s;tice ab&s;olutely required it, and the law of God in the ca&s;e could not be di&s;pen&s;ed with, nor the law of civil &s;ociety, without becoming par|takers of your guilt, and drawing down the judgments of heaven upon the land. I tru&s;t you view matters in this light, and that you ju&s;tify both God and man in your condemna|tion.
<PB N="23" REF="015872_0021_0F9AD9897947F4A8">
Indeed, I have found you freely doing &s;o, and that you have had no di&s;po&s;ition to hide or cover your guilt. The monitor with|in, charged you with it, and you have been free in your confe&s;&s;ion. And I tru&s;t you have been &s;o, not only to man, but to the omni&s;cient God, your righteous judge, before whom you will this very day appear, before the &s;hadows of the evening are &s;tretched over us. Such con|fe&s;&s;ion to God, enters into the nature of true repentance, a grace you mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, as you would be found of your judge in peace. If you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of true repentance, you &s;ee your&s;elves as you are, &s;ee your vilene&s;s, pollu|tion and guiltine&s;s, and how ju&s;tly God might ca&s;t you off forever. But you &s;ee him at the &s;ame time, &s;eated upon a throne of mercy, ready to receive repenting, returning &s;inners, to pardon and &s;ave them; not for their &s;akes, but for his own name &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of his &s;on Je&s;us, who once hung bleeding for &s;inners on the ignominious tree, and who&s;e blood is of infinite value, &s;ufficient to clean&s;e away all your guilt and pollution, even the guilt of that &s;carlet and crim&s;on iniquity, for which you are this day to &s;uffer an ignomini|ous death. You will &s;ee in all its black colours (I hope you have done &s;o before this your la&s;t day) the &s;in of &s;hedding innocent blood. The deed of that fatal night, when you might &s;ay, as in <HI>Proverbs</HI> i, 11, <HI>Come let us lay wait for

O the di&s;honour done to God! the cruelty and inju&s;tice to a fellow crea|ture, one who had never in the lea&s;t injured you! Indeed, if <HI>he</HI> who&s;e blood you imbrued your hands in, was a good man, you were on|ly the in&s;truments of &s;ending him to heaven a little before the time, though no thanks to you, for you meant not &s;o. But if he was a wicked man,(a &s;uppo&s;ition I would very un|willingly make) what was the ca&s;e of his im|mortal &s;oul, when you hurried him out of the world, without his having the opportunity to lift up one cry to the God of heaven for mercy? You mu&s;t not look upon it as a &s;evere reproach, when I &s;ay, that it was a mo&s;t &s;hocking, cruel murder, and, taken in all its circum&s;tances, &s;uch an in&s;tance as has never happened in this land from the fir&s;t &s;ettle|ment of it, and indeed it is &s;carcely to be par|rallelled in all hi&s;tory.</P>

You have &s;urely no cau&s;e to complain, for the want of the mo&s;t kind, humane, chri&s;tian treatment, from fir&s;t to la&s;t. And I tru&s;t you have a grateful &s;en&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Much pains, you are &s;en&s;ible, have been ta|ken with you in public and in private: Mo&s;t whole&s;ome in&s;tructions and coun&s;els have been admini&s;tered to you, and prayers have been continually going up before God on your behalf.

You are indeed looked upon by man, as guilty, yea, as the author and procurer of the bloody deed, but for whom it had never been perpetrated. The evidence in the ca&s;e was too glaring to lead any one to a different &s;entiment.

<P>After trial and &s;entence, they ju&s;tified God and man in their condemnation.

till late at night, in reading the Bible and many valuable books that were put into their hands, in praying and &s;inging p&s;alms and hymns. They became mighty in the &s;criptures, and were wont to make very pertinent ob&s;ervati|ons upon many pa&s;&s;ages that were mentioned to them. They were per&s;ons of good, natural capacity: <HI>Buchanan</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;s</HI> in all their con|ver&s;ation di&s;covered a con&s;iderable extent of it: And <HI>Brooks</HI> had a good &s;hare of it.

They were wont to &s;peak in a mo&s;t feeling manner of the love of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us&mdash;of their entire, hearty tru&s;t to the merit of his blood&mdash;of the vilene&s;s and odiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in, of the di&s;honour thereby done to God, the ba&s;e ingratitude of it towards him, and of the contempt thereby ca&s;t upon the blood and &s;a|crifice of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us: The di&s;honour done to God by &s;in, was the burden of the &s;ong with them, not what they &s;uffered or were about to &s;uffer.</P>

The papers which they left are full of expre&s;&s;ions of this kind. They appeared to have an entire benevolence to|wards all men&mdash;very thankful for all kindne&s;&s;|es, and they received many; heartily di&s;po&s;ed to forgive all who had any ways injured them.</P>

There were all the external evidences of true penitence in them that could be ex|pected. A &s;abbath or two before their expect|ed execution, <HI>Ro&s;s</HI> was publickly bapti&s;ed. He appeared to under&s;tand well, the nature and de&s;ign of the ordinance, and attended upon it with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;olemnity: He found it a good day, having had tokens of God's gracious pre&s;ence with him, as he &s;ig|nified afterwards. They expected to have been executed on the 4th of June, the time ap|pointed. When I brought them the tidings of a reprieve for four weeks, they told me it was contrary to their expectations, tru&s;ted that they were in a &s;tate of readine&s;s to leave the world; but expre&s;&s;ed great thankfulne&s;s to God and man for this further &s;pace, and &s;et apart the 4th of June entirely for religious exerci&s;es; employing it in reading, and in &s;o|litary and &s;ocial prayer, taking no bodily re|fre&s;hment till the clo&s;e of the day. As I had much opportunity, even almo&s;t daily to know their &s;tate, &s;o I have rea&s;on to think that they improved the time further granted them, in the very be&s;t manner. When young per&s;ons, as was common, vi&s;ited them, they would deal out the mo&s;t &s;erious, &s;olemn, affectionate coun|&s;els and warnings to them: They were de|&s;irous of frequent opportunities of this kind, that they might do &s;ome little good before they left the world.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="015872_0034_0F9AD995A0C3E0E0">
A few days before their execution, being minded that the time drew near, and being a&s;ked, whether it did not give them peculiar anxiety; they replied, <HI>None at all,</HI> for that <HI>they tru&s;ted it would be well with them,</HI> or to that effect. I vi&s;ited them early in the morn|ing of that day, found them calm and com|po&s;ed. One of them ob&s;erved, as near as I can remember, that <HI>the &s;un would no more ari&s;e upon them here&punc; but tru&s;ted before night they &s;hould be in glory!</HI> In the &s;ame compo&s;ed frame, they went to the place of execution, attended by a number of mini&s;ters. When they mounted the &s;caffold, <HI>Ro&s;s</HI> made an au|dible and very affectionate prayer, the others went to their private devotions, and continu|ed in them till they were turned off. <HI>Buchan|an,</HI> in particular, upon the &s;tage appeared with a plea&s;ant a&s;pect, an&s;wering to that repre&s;enta|tion of Dr. <HI>Watts, '&s;miling and plea&s;ed in death.'</HI></P>
<P>A very heavy thunder &s;torm came on ju&s;t before they were turned off, which &s;eemed to add to the &s;olemnity of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>As to Mrs. <HI>Spooner,</HI> &s;he profe&s;&s;ed that her match with her hu&s;band was not agreable to her. Dome&s;tic di&s;&s;entions &s;oon took place, and went on from &s;tep to &s;tep, till &s;he conceived an utter aver&s;ion to him; at length &s;he me|ditated his de&s;truction; laid &s;everal plans, and never gave over till the fatal act was com|mitted. Her guilt in this matter appeared in
<PB N="37" REF="015872_0035_0F9AD9962F786F70">
mo&s;t flagrant colours upon her trial as well as &s;ince, from the &s;olemn declaration of the poor men whom &s;he employed in the bloody deed, and to whom &s;he promi&s;ed a large reward, which reward they immediately received.</P>
<P>I &s;oon vi&s;ited her after her commitment. She was not very free to conver&s;e upon the &s;ubject. And indeed it was difficult to con|ver&s;e freely upon it till after her trial. After this, opportunity was given in the fulle&s;t man|ner. She did not blame judges or jurors or the Attorney-General, but often declared that the witne&s;&s;es wronged her. She declared, that <HI>though &s;he had planned the matter, yet, that &s;he never thought it would be executed; that &s;he relented when &s;he found they were in earne&s;t.</HI> She doubtle&s;s could have given her hu&s;band notice of what was de&s;igned, and &s;o have pre|vented it, but &s;he did not; nor did &s;he make di&s;covery of it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, but &s;ent the next morning to a neighbour's to enquire af|ter him, when at the &s;ame time &s;he knew he was in the well. She could not be brought to acknowledge her guilt or the ju&s;tne&s;s of her &s;entence till very late in the day, as &s;hall be mentioned. It &s;eems &s;he went upon this mi&s;taken principle that &s;he was not an im|mediate actor. She was a per&s;on of uncom|mon fortitude of mind; did not for the mo&s;t part appear to be affected with many circum|&s;tances
<PB N="38" REF="015872_0036_0F9AD99952CEC608">
in her ca&s;e which were wont deeply to affect others. She would indeed &s;ome|times &s;ay, that &s;he felt more than &s;he did or could expre&s;s. Seldom a day pa&s;&s;ed but I vi|&s;ited her, for which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed great grati|tude. I was wont to conver&s;e with her up|on the main point, and to endeavour to im|pre&s;s her mind with a &s;en&s;e of her guilt, hop|ing to ob&s;erve upon her the &s;ymptoms of true penitence. Appearances of this were from time to time di&s;couraging.</P>
<P>Her behaviour to all was very polite and complai&s;ant. From the frequent opportuni|ties I had with her, I was led to conceive of her, as a per&s;on naturally of a kind, obliging, generous di&s;po&s;ition: But &s;he was unhappy, as above mentioned, in her fir&s;t &s;etting out in the world, and &s;o left to a fatal capital crime.</P>
<P>It appeared to many that carefully ob&s;erved her, for many weeks before her execution, that &s;he was in a &s;tate of pregnancy. She accordingly petitioned authority for a re&s;pite. A jury of matrons was appointed to examine her. They did not bring in in her favour; &s;he petitioned again but it was not granted; accordingly execution was ordered; &s;he re|ceived the tidings with great calmne&s;s. At her own de&s;ire, that the public might be &s;a|tisfied, &s;he was opened the evening after exe|cution, and a perfect' male <HI>&s;oetus</HI> of the growth of five months or near it, in the judg|ment
<PB N="39" REF="015872_0037_0F9AD99A942695A8">
of the operators, was taken from her. Having undergone a &s;econd examination a few days before her execution, and being thereby greatly di&s;ordered, &s;he was not able to attend the &s;ermon that day.</P>
<P>Soon after it, I went to the goal with a number of my brethren; &s;he appeared very calm, humble and penitent, profe&s;&s;ed her faith in the great &s;aviour and dependance up|on him; upon its being propo&s;ed to her, &s;he readily con&s;ented to be baptized; &s;he was &s;o immediately, as but a few moments remained before &s;he mu&s;t go forth. The &s;cene was very &s;olemn and affecting; &s;he was not at all daunted when the &s;heriff pre&s;ented her with and-put on the fatal cord; &s;he told him &s;he e&s;teemed it as much as though he had put on a necklace of gold or diamonds. She pre|&s;ently went forth, I accompanied her in a carriage to the place of execution; &s;he ap|peared undi&s;mayed and unaffrighted at the various &s;triking &s;cenes that opened from one &s;tage to another. At length we came in &s;ight of the gallows, I a&s;ked her if the &s;ight of it did not &s;trike her? She an&s;wered not at all any more than any other object. Her con|&s;titutional politene&s;s &s;till remained, and &s;he di&s;covered it to numbers that were near her. She pre&s;ently mounted the &s;caffold, and while the &s;heriff was fixing her, &s;he told him, with a &s;erene countenance, <HI>that it was the happie&s;t
<PB N="40" REF="015872_0038_0F9AD99B828F0398">
day &s;he ever &s;aw, for &s;he doubted not it would be well with her.</HI> She acknowledged <HI>that &s;he ju&s;tly died; that &s;he hoped to &s;ee her chri&s;|tian friends &s;he left behind her, in Heaven, but that none of them might go there in the ig|nominious manner that &s;he did.</HI> It was a fix|ed principle with her, that confe&s;&s;ion of her faults was proper only to be made to her maker, not to men; &s;he often declared, <HI>that &s;he was not neglectful of this and found &s;atis|faction in &s;o doing;</HI> but at the la&s;t ca&s;t, &s;he did this at lea&s;t implicitly to the &s;heriff, as ju&s;t related. I would be far from pre&s;um|ing to decide upon her future &s;tate or that of the re&s;t of them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add a &s;hort extract from the &s;ermon I delivered to my people the Lord's day following; <HI>"We know what are the in|finite compa&s;&s;ions of God, and that the blood of Je&s;us is of infinite value, clean&s;ing from all un|righteou&s;ne&s;s. We may by no means limit the holy one of I&s;rael. We read of the &s;ervant that came in at the eleventh hour, who received the &s;ame wages as tho&s;e who had borne the bur|den and heat of the day: We know what was done by our Saviour, to the penitent thief upon the cro&s;s, ju&s;t before he expired. This &s;hows us what divine power and grace can do and may do. But &s;ecret things belong to God, and we ought to leave them with him.</HI></P>
