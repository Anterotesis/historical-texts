<HEAD>THE MYSTIC COTTAGER OF CHAMOUNY.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>AUGUSTUS Tankerville, Marquis of Sevig|ne, was a native of Switzerland, the la&s;t de&s;cend|ant of an ancient and noble family, who on the decea&s;e of his Marchione&s;s, came over to re&s;ide in England, in o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r to try if by changing the &s;cene he could divert the melancholy which was his in&s;e|parable companion, in the &s;outhern clime.</P>
<P>The Dowager Lady Mentoria, his aunt, who was fondly endeared to him during the whole cour&s;e of his life, determined to accompany him and his charming offspring; the elde&s;t of whom,
<PB N="8" REF="029134_0006_0FDFAC947B041BC8">
a &s;on, had very lately taken the title of St. Lau|rens, and the ladies, Adela and Loui&s;a, were then in their &s;eventeenth and eighteenth years, charm|ing accompli&s;hed women, who had improved an elegant education by a refined under&s;tanding mould|ed to every impre&s;&s;ion of virtue and genius; in &s;hort it was an arduous deci&s;ion to adjudge the prize of beauty or &s;en&s;ibility to one in preference to the other.</P>
<P>Lady Adela was tall and of exqui&s;ite pro|portion, and her complexion beautifully tran&s;pa|rent; and the ro&s;eat bloom of health diffu&s;ed its beauties on her cheek, her profu&s;e hair of the pal|e&s;t brown, and the benignant &s;oftne&s;s that beam|ed from her fine blue eyes, gave her the appear|ance of a cele&s;tial divinity.</P>
<P>Lady Loui&s;a was rather &s;horter than he &s;i&s;ter, yet &s;ufficiently tall to be a gracefully elegant figure. Her hair was auburn, and &s;ported in the fanta&s;tic luxuriance of nature on a bo&s;om and &s;houlders of the fine&s;t form; her complexion clear, her teeth beautifully white and regular, and a thou&s;and dimples played round her coral lips; her eyes were dark and expre&s;&s;ive, yet tempered with ineffable &s;weetne&s;s; her voice exqui&s;itely melodi|ous, and her genius lively and expanded; of the French and Italian languages &s;he was perfect mi&s;tre&s;s; the &s;cience of mu&s;ic was her chief delight,
<PB N="9" REF="029134_0007_0FDFAC96473C6AC0">
and &s;he touched the piano and harp to perfection; in the dance &s;he was the &s;prightly aerial of the &s;cene, where her inimitable attitude and grace captivated every beholder.</P>
<P>Lady Adela with a con&s;titution more delicate, had never &s;tudied to excel in that accompli&s;hment, yet &s;he joined the fe&s;tive group, with a peculiar degree of graceful ea&s;e, but her principal perfec|tion con&s;i&s;ted in copying minutely elegant draw|ings, from the choice&s;t collection of the mo&s;t emi|nent proficients, add to which her natural ta&s;te, and the picture&s;que views that bounded the con|fines of the ca&s;tle, gave unlimited &s;cope to the pro|lific and accurate traces of her animated crayon.</P>
<P>Her amiable brother, Lord Edwin St. Laurens, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a noble &s;pirit, a generous expan&s;ion of &s;oul, and an under&s;tanding cha&s;te and refined, while liberality, gratitude, and genero&s;ity were the a&s;piring virtues of his heart. He was now ju&s;t of age, and was preparing to make an excur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ion through Switzerland, and explore the beauties of that country, before he undertook his trip to In|dia, accompanied by his juvenile friend, the Cheva|lier D' Aubigne, then at Paris, and with whom he intended pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome weeks before his return: La|dies Adela and Loui&s;a reluctantly parted with their brother, accompanied only by his faithful valet Carlos, who earne&s;tly entreated to attend his ma&s;|ter,
<PB N="10" REF="029134_0008_0FDFAC989CC0FE10">
"for there," &s;ighed he, "in a romantic cot|tage, on the mountains dwells my &s;weet little Marcella, and if you will indulge me, honoured Sir, in this reque&s;t, my life and &s;ervices &s;hall be ever devoted in gratitude." A manly tear was ha&s;tily bru&s;hed away, and Lord Edwin's acquie&s;|cent &s;mile &s;ealed his hopes.</P>
<P>The morning of departure arrived, and the Marquis embracing his &s;on, bid him write often, and never forget he had left a parent in England, anxious for the welfare of a dear and loved child, the pride and glory of his declining years.</P>
<P>Lord Edwin pre&s;&s;ed his hand, uttered an affec|tionate avowel of obedience, and tenderly &s;alut|ing his lovely &s;i&s;ters, departed from the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The faithful Carlos, all gratitude for the fa|vour of attending his ma&s;ter, redoubled his a&s;&s;i|duity on every occa&s;ion. Carlos, though the &s;on of a Swi&s;s pea&s;ant, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great natural abili|ties, and had been in&s;tructed in the early part of his life in many nece&s;&s;ary accompli&s;hments, to ful|fil the duties of his pre&s;ent &s;tation, by a gentle|man re&s;iding in Savoy, who had recommended him to the patronage of Lord Edwin about two years &s;ince, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing great good nature and a natural|ly lively di&s;po&s;ition: Lord Edwin would often wonder at the vi&s;ible gloom that &s;ometimes over|&s;pread
<PB N="11" REF="029134_0009_0FDFAC9A57588C18">
his countenance, in &s;pite of every endea|vour to conceal it, but &s;ince the name of Marcel|la had e&s;caped his lips, he was all life, all happi|ne&s;s, and merrily pa&s;&s;ed the hours with due defer|ence and di&s;tinction to his noble ma&s;ter, who was now at no lo&s;s to gue&s;s the cau&s;e of his &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>About the &s;econd week they arrived at the foot of the mountain, on who&s;e &s;ummit the well known cottage of Marcella's parents reared its humble &s;helter; Carlos &s;wiftly darting to the door, peep|ed through the ca&s;ement, and gently tapped, in|&s;tantly the latch was drawn and Marcella flew to the arms of Carlos.&mdash;Lord Edwin &s;eated at a di&s;|tance on an impending jut of the craggy &s;teep, be|held with delight the faithful and &s;incere raptures of the&s;e artle&s;s lovers. Marcella was a pretty little figure, habited in a pale brown &s;tuff jacket, with a &s;hort blue petticoat, that di&s;played one of the prettie&s;t legs and yellow &s;lippers in Savoy; her dark ringlets were confined by a blue &s;ilk net, through the folds of which many &s;portive curls wantoned o'er her poli&s;hed forehead, a &s;mall hand|kerchief of lawn &s;haded her bo&s;om, and on her arm was &s;u&s;pended a ba&s;ket of luxuriant grapes ju&s;t gathered from the vineyard behind the cottage.</P>
<P>After the moment of &s;urpri&s;e was over, &s;he ad|vanced with Carlos towards Lord Edwin, and
<PB N="12" REF="029134_0010_0FDFAC9F25B6E458">
mode&s;tly offering the produce of her ba&s;ket, en|treated his Lord&s;hip to walk in and take &s;helter from the meridian &s;un-beams, as the day was grow|ing &s;ultry. A clu&s;ter of the purple vintage was as gratefully accepted as be&s;towed, but the vi&s;it to the cottage was declined; Lord Edwin in fact did not mean to intrude on the worthy inmates, but wi&s;hed to &s;troll and amu&s;e him&s;elf for half an hour, he then promi&s;ed Carlos he &s;hould return in three days and pa&s;s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> week with the&s;e happy mountaineers, while he paid a vi&s;it to a family about thirty miles di&s;tant. Marcella's eyes glowing with delight &s;eemed to thank him, and Carlos, filled with ad|miration of his kindne&s;s, bowed his grateful ac|knowledgments of the favour conferred with &s;o much real conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lord Edwin kept his promi&s;e of &s;paring the en|raptured Carlos, but his departure mightily plea|&s;ed him, the poor fellow had ari&s;en by day break, and at five he crept down &s;tairs to wake the &s;er+vants, and &s;addle his mule, which he fa&s;tened to the back gate, and entering the hall was met by Lord Edwin, who, tempted by the beauty of the morning, had aro&s;e to give him &s;ome orders for|got the preceding evening.
<Q>Are you already equipped, Carlos?</Q>
<Q>Yes, my Lord, I &s;hall now be off in five minutes,</Q>
an&s;wered he, very de|liberately, tying up his little bundle of linen, in which he had actually packed up one boot: Lord
<PB N="13" REF="029134_0011_0FDFACA21B47B808">
Edwin ob&s;erved the circum&s;tance, and &s;tifled his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ibility 'till the package was completely fini&s;h|ed, and the poor fellow half crazy with delight, and his every thought employed in anticipating the joyful meeting, begging to know, if his Lord|&s;hip had any farther commands; being an&s;wered in the negative, in&s;tantly made his re&s;pectful obei|&s;ance and mounted his mule.</P>
<P>"Stop, Carlos," cried Lord Edwin, "do they u&s;ually travel here with one boot?"&mdash;Carlos in|&s;tantly ca&s;t his eyes on his right leg, and beheld it only equipped with a &s;tocking and &s;lipper:
"'Tis very true my Lord," an&s;wered he, <Q>but heaven knows where I have left it.</Q> <Q>Why, if you &s;hould have occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of it,</Q>
rejoined Lord Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">,
<Q>only untie your bundle and you'll find it carefully wedged in.</Q>
Carlos in&s;tantly laid his hand on the handkerchief and to his great confu&s;ion felt the truth of his conviction: "Ble&s;s my heart," cried h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, twitching the knot,
<Q>'twas Walter's fault, for he was a&s;king me &s;o many que&s;tions about Marcella all the time, that I could attend to nothing but the plea&s;ure of gratifying his inquiries.</Q>
Lord Edwin en|joyed a hearty laugh at the bu&s;tle that detained the anxious traveller, who had not even waited to &s;wallow a mor&s;el of breakfa&s;t, but a few mo|ments
<PB N="14" REF="029134_0012_0FDFACA3CF4CCF20">
completed the arrangements and once more mounting he galloped off and was out of &s;ight in in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Time did not hobble on crutches with Carlos and Marcella, and at the appointed time he re|turned, delighted with the promi&s;e of again pa&s;|&s;ing her cottage to bid adieu, in his way to Eng|land.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>LORD EDWIN's tour again commenced and he determined vi&s;iting the Vale of Chamouny, he therefore hired a guide and bent his cour&s;e to that beautifully romantic &s;cene. Here he re&s;ted to contemplate the ro&s;eat tints of morn inter&s;per&s;ed with golden fluids, reflecting its glowing beam on on the &s;ummit of the mountains: A murmuring ca&s;cade broke the &s;olemn &s;ilence that reigned a|round; the dulcet notes of a &s;hepherd's pipe waft|ed on the bo&s;om of the breeze &s;ounded from the valley; here a huge cliff bent its lowering brow maje&s;tically grand; there one more fertilized ex|hibited the traces of the plough, on its rugged &s;ides, while blooming wild weeds luxuriantly hung in waving wreaths from innumerable im|pending projections of rocks; many beautiful va|grant rills gently &s;tole through various crevices, while &s;ome impeded in their cour&s;e by rude frag|ments of &s;tone impetuou&s;ly broke a pa&s;&s;age and precipitated the &s;parkling foam down a tremendous
<PB N="16" REF="029134_0014_0FDFACAC16C0B118">
declivity 'till it pau&s;ed in the mazy windings of a gentle &s;tream.</P>
<P>"How &s;ublimely beautiful is this wild luxu|riance of prolific nature," exclaimed the en|raptured &s;pectator. The &s;un was ri&s;ing to ani|mate each picture&s;que beauty, but the heat was great; "Let us de&s;cend the mountains," "&s;aid Lord Edwin,
<Q>I am very thir&s;ty, and perhaps at tho&s;e di&s;tant cottages I could procure a draught of milk,</Q>
<Q>Aye plenty, your honour,</Q>
replied the guide,
<Q>if you will conde&s;cend to accept &s;ome at the cottage of Reuben and Giraldine De&s;moulines, where the &s;weet girls will be up, and can &s;upply your ho|nour with an excellent breakfa&s;t, for I am al|ways welcome as a prince, and any compa|ny I conduct are &s;hewn the greate&s;t re&s;pect.</Q>
"proceed," &s;aid Lord Edwin,
<Q>my curio&s;ity may po&s;&s;ibly be yet more gratified.</Q></P>
<P>Slowly they de&s;cended a winding path 'till they reached the valley, and here they again re&s;ted. On every &s;ide the towering Glaci|ers reared their &s;now-crowned heads in a thou&s;and fanta&s;tic forms, and proudly contra&s;ted their ad|mirable &s;uperiority of magnificence with the fertilized mountains beneath, while &s;cattered on their &s;ummit and various tracts of the acclivity in irregular romantic &s;helterings of the &s;teep peeped the white cottages of the pea&s;ants; in
<PB N="17" REF="029134_0015_0FDFACADE95D4F48">
&s;hort, no &s;ituation could exhibit a &s;cene more di|ver&s;ified and plea&s;ing; here the eye wandered from one beauty to another more enchanting, and when it &s;eemed to have di&s;covered &s;ome &s;till more &s;uperior view, the &s;lighte&s;t glance pre&s;ented ano|ther if po&s;&s;ible more inviting and wonderful, ap|parantly rai&s;ed by the power of magic to capti|vate the a&s;toni&s;hed beholder.</P>
<P>The &s;hining bee &s;tole from her hive, and mur|muring through the air was bu&s;ily extracting from the bloom her liquid &s;weet; two or three hovels only &s;ituate in perilous apertures of the mountain, had &s;uffer deva&s;tation by the falling of the &s;now from the tremendous heights, where a coagulated ma&s;s had lately been driven by the winds, bearing in its pa&s;&s;age mouldering fragments of rock, who&s;e inevitable direction had cru&s;hed and partly &s;mo|thered the de&s;olated roofs. Lord Edwin &s;hudder|ed, yet the &s;pectacle was truly grand, for part of the ma&s;s had fallen in different directions, &s;ome on the edge of the &s;teep, &s;ome in the meandering ri|vulet, and part re&s;ted on the ru&s;tic one-railed bridge that cro&s;&s;ed the &s;tream, from who&s;e un|couth &s;tructure &s;u&s;pended innumerable i&s;icles of the mo&s;t curious form; the aerial chori&s;ters were warbling their orai&s;ons, and the inhabitants of the vale &s;eemed the only undelighted enjoyers of the &s;cene, becau&s;e to them it exhibited no novelty,
<PB N="18" REF="029134_0016_0FDFACAFAC0CB7D8">
con&s;equently but little allurement; the eye of the &s;tranger alone beheld it with admiration, and the heart of &s;en&s;ibility could alone feel the exqui|&s;ite &s;en&s;ations of delight its contemplation in|&s;pired.</P>
<P>By the mo&s;t inviting paths, bordered with flow|ers, &s;trewn by the hand of nature, they at length arrived at the cottage; nothing could be more centrically &s;ituated to command the &s;urrounding beauties of this magic &s;pot: The door was open, and a charming girl had ju&s;t entered with a lap full of flowers to deck her burni&s;hed ca&s;ement, who&s;e chequered pane glowed with the refulgence of the ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P>"Ah! Madelon," &s;aid the guide, "is dame Giraldine up? Can you furni&s;h his honour with a cup of milk, an oat cake, or a gla&s;s of your ex|cellent mead?" Madelon dropped a curt&s;ey, and blu&s;hing more beautiful than the ro&s;es &s;he held in her hand, mode&s;tly entreated Lord Edwin to walk in and accept their humble fare. Not at all di&s;plea&s;ed at his guide's per&s;picuity in whi&s;|pering that Madelon was a pretty girl, he con|templated, as he walked by her &s;ide, the &s;weet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mplicity of her regular features, which though they could not be deemed hand&s;ome, yet an in|de&s;cribable &s;omething in her mode&s;t &s;mile told
<PB N="19" REF="029134_0017_0FDFACB2106C0A60">
you her bo&s;om was the rece&s;s of tranquility, the man&s;ion of peace.</P>
<P>She then led him to a neat apartment, where a &s;econd female was merrily turning the &s;pinning wheel, and &s;weetly &s;inging &s;ome rural ballad, but the moment Lord Edwin entered, the &s;ong cea&s;ed, and the wheel was &s;topped, while the enchanting countenance of the indu&s;trious pea&s;ant pre&s;ent|ing him her chair with a graceful curt&s;ey, made him &s;tart with a&s;toni&s;hment, her &s;traw Hat, which hung on the back of it was in&s;tantly tied on, and mode&s;tly intended to &s;hade the deranged plaits of a neat lawn cap, which confined part of her luxuriant light tre&s;&s;es, while a few &s;traggling ringlets played on her lovely face; her &s;parkling blue eyes beamed the very &s;oul of &s;en&s;ibility through the &s;hades of the fine&s;t dark eye la&s;hes, that re&s;embled fringe of the mo&s;t beautiful glo&s;s and texture, and the exqui&s;itely traced arches of the &s;ame colour, penciled by the hand of nature, added a &s;till &s;uperior elegance to her features; her dre&s;s was &s;imple yet the very model of neat|ne&s;s, and while Lord Edwin gazed with rapture, his fancy compared her to a flower of exqui&s;ite beauty and delicacy, reared in an uncultivated &s;oil by the hand of Providence, blooming in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ades of ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Entranced by the delightful contemplation, he was rou&s;ed from his rever&s;e by the voice of his
<PB N="20" REF="029134_0018_0FDFACB9383A4598">
guide, addre&s;&s;ing a pretty little girl about twelve years old, who was tenderly gazing on a ne&s;t of young birds &s;he humanely was endeavouring to feed. In tears my little Jo&s;ephine, reiterated he. "What have you there, &s;weet cottager," a&s;ked Lord Edwin, peeping over her &s;houlder, "that cau&s;es that compa&s;&s;ionate tear?</P>
<P>"A ne&s;t of unfledged birds, your honour," replied &s;he, wiping off the chri&s;tal pendant on the back of her wor&s;ted mitten, "I bought them this morning of there cruel boys, who were going to torment them; I had but one florin which they gladly took, &s;o I popped them into my apron, and tying up the bundle of faggots I had been to pick up, placed them on my head, and come home pretty well loaded; but what vexes me mo&s;t is, they wont eat, and I can't help &s;hed|ding a tear they &s;eem &s;o pitiful."</P>
<P>Well, thought Lord Edwin, what perfection &s;hall I next di&s;cover in this enviable vale; al|ready have I been enchanted with the beauties of nature, and the a&s;piring virtues of genero&s;ity and humanity have ju&s;t pre&s;ented them&s;elves to com|plete the picture.</P>

<P>IT was the tenth evening, as Lord Edwin pro|mi&s;&s;ed, when he returned to Chamouny; Ro&s;alie and Madelon had &s;trolled to the top of the moun|tain to di&s;cover if the traveller approached; their be&s;t grey &s;tuff jackets had been neatly put on, and their clean lawn caps were fa&s;tened with primro&s;e top-knots, each took their &s;pindles and &s;eated them|&s;elves on the &s;ummit of the &s;teep, to watch his ar|rival; the &s;hades of the evening veiled the fading land&s;cape, and the moon was ri&s;ing in faint &s;ilvery gleam. Ro&s;alie grew re&s;tle&s;s, &s;he tangled the flax, threw the &s;pindle a&s;ide, took it up again, and again the flax broke: her patience was every way exhau&s;t|ed, and once more 'ere &s;he returned to the cottage, &s;he climbed an impending part of the mountain, and with earne&s;t and out&s;tretched eyes, &s;he at a great di&s;|tance de&s;cried the mules &s;lowly pacing the winding track; in&s;tantly the blood for&s;ook her cheek&mdash;re|turned&mdash;fled&mdash;and returned again. Madelon ob&s;er|ved her agitation with the deepe&s;t regret, and care|fully
<PB N="32" REF="029134_0030_0FDFACDE7B1E9520">
concealed her thoughts, determined however to mark the reception on all &s;ides, and Lord Edwin &s;oon after gained the &s;ummit. "How are my &s;weet girls?" &s;aid he, extending a hand to each, "I have a trifle for Madelon, a charming bird for Jo&s;ephine, and a lute for Ro&s;alie, who, I am informed, plays delightfully." Ro&s;alie thanked him more eloquent|ly with her eyes than her lips, and they de&s;cended to the vale.</P>
<P>Impatient to impart the plea&s;ing news, Ro&s;alie tripped quickly on to appri&s;e Giraldine, while Lord Edwin chatted with Madelon, and pa&s;&s;ing a whithered ro&s;e-tree. "Ble&s;s me" &s;aid he, "how the ro&s;es have faded in Chamouny, and even the cheeks of Ro&s;alie have lo&s;t their u&s;ual bloom &s;ince I &s;aw them. "Ah!" replied Madelon, "they have drooped indeed, but I &s;till entertain a hope, <HI>&s;ome</HI> of them may revive."</P>
<P>The peculiar empha&s;is re&s;ted on the word <HI>&s;ome,</HI> accompanied by an arch look and half a &s;mile, did not e&s;cape Lord Edwin, and he would have a&s;ked an explanation had not Ro&s;alie and Jo&s;ephine at that moment joined them.</P>
<P>"Where are your little birds?" a&s;ked he, tap|ping the ro&s;y cheeks of Jo&s;ephine." "Oh, all dead, my Lord," an&s;wered &s;he, &s;haking her head, they did not live two days after you left us;
<PB N="33" REF="029134_0031_0FDFACE0C1D6B400">
poor Ro&s;alie's arm was &s;o painful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he could not &s;pin, &s;o I was obliged to help her, and perhaps neglected them."</P>
<P>"Never mind," replied Lord Edwin, "Carlos has a &s;weet bird for you." At that moment the faithful dome&s;tic entered with the portmanteau and bird: Jo&s;ephine eagerly examined its beauty, but wi&s;hed it had been a parroquet, that &s;he might have taught it the name of the generous donor. "Do you &s;ing?" a&s;ked Lord Edwin. Jo&s;ephine again &s;hook her head; "a&s;k Ro&s;alie, my Lord, &s;he's our &s;weete&s;t nightingale, though &s;he has not &s;ung a &s;ong this week pa&s;t." Lovely innocent, thought Lord Edwin, how &s;weetly ha&s;t thou re|vealed the ill &s;ecreted thorn that rankles in the bo&s;om of thy charming &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Supper was &s;erved by Madelon &s;oon after, and Lord Edwin entreated to &s;tay and accept a &s;pare bed they &s;ometimes accommodated travellers with, while Carlos was provided with another at a neighbouring cottage.</P>
<P>The blu&s;hing tints of ro&s;y morning &s;carcely dawned when Lord Edwin was awakened by the plaintive melody of Ro&s;alie's lute under his win|dow, and ri&s;ing he peeped through his ca&s;ement; &s;he had taken her &s;eat in a little arbour which half concealed her by the profu&s;ion of ro&s;es that de|pended
<PB N="34" REF="029134_0032_0FDFACE270DE2990">
from the rural lattice, while the expre&s;&s;ive beauty of her countenance depicted her to the eye of fancy the mo&s;t perfect &s;emblance of the queen of love repo&s;ing in her Paphian bower. She had fa&s;tened the lute to a violet ribbon which hung at her &s;ide, and when &s;he had fini&s;hed her plaintive air, gently let it fall to its appropriate &s;ituation, and remained &s;ome moments in a deep reverie 'till the approach of Jo&s;ephine with a fine ba&s;ket of peaches rou&s;ed her from the attitude of contem|plation.</P>
<P>Some few words, uttered in a low key e&s;caped the attentive ear of Lord Edwin, but as they en|tered the hou&s;e he plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed the voice of Ro&s;alie, utter the following words.</P>
<P>"Don't, touch them Jo&s;ephine, 'till his Lord|&s;hip comes down, I dare &s;ay he likes peaches, and at lea&s;t we can give him our &s;hare; 'twas lucky Lindor &s;hould &s;end them, &s;tep up and li&s;ten if his Lord&s;hip is &s;tirring, while I gather a few blo&s;&s;oms to ornament the parlour."</P>
<P>The voice was then &s;ilent, and Lord Edwin drawing a&s;ide the little mu&s;lin curtain that had cautiou&s;ly concealed him, fini&s;hed his dre&s;s, when ca&s;ting his eyes round to admire the neatne&s;s of his apartment, he ob&s;erved a miniature &s;u&s;pended on a &s;mall hook by a piece of black ribbon much

worn. Curio&s;ity was on the wing, he approach|ed, and taking it in his hand, &s;trictly examined it. "Who&s;e could it be," it was rather improbable it &s;hould belong to any of the family, and he had never yet &s;een any one in this cottage whom it re&s;embled, certain he was if it proved a real copy, the original mu&s;t be a mo&s;t beautiful woman, and the robe &s;he wore, added to the band of pearls which confined part of her flowing tre&s;&s;es, be|&s;poke her at lea&s;t a per&s;on of dignity; in &s;hort, it was a my&s;tery his penetration could not unfold&punc; he hung it up and viewing it at a di&s;tance, fancied he could trace the bewitching &s;mile of Ro&s;alie, yet the idea &s;eemed &s;o ab&s;urd he in&s;tantly altered his opinion, when a tran&s;ient thought recalled to his memory the promi&s;ed explanation of the little &s;hrine he had vi&s;ited in the rece&s;s of the mountain, and half convinced him this miniature tended to elucidate his &s;urmi&s;e, and he de&s;cended the &s;tairs with a full determination of claiming Reuben's promi&s;e.</P>

<P>Madelon looked earne&s;tly at her mother, while Ro&s;alie's cheek turned pale, and a &s;tarting tear irradiated her eye; every one was &s;ilent but the innocent and loquacious Jo&s;ephine, who, cla&s;p|ing her hands, and gazing tenderly on Ro&s;alie, cried, "Oh! my Lord, don't you think it very like our &s;weet Ro&s;alie, why its her own dear mam|ma's picture."</P>
<P>Confu&s;ion and &s;urpri&s;e prevented Lord Edwin's reply, and as no one appeared able or willing to contradict the a&s;&s;ertion, he was pretty well con|vinced of the reality of the &s;tory. At length re|covering the power of articulation, he ventured to inquire a few particulars, and Jo&s;ephine being &s;ilenced, Giraldine proceeded to relate the narra|tive of Ro&s;alie, "who, &s;he &s;aid, was born in that cottage about &s;eventeen years &s;ince, that M.

M.

<P>Giraldine added, the lady appeared almo&s;t di&s;|tracted at parting with her companions, and as the carriage drove off &s;he heard the &s;ervant a&s;k the po&s;tilions if the Marquis meant to cro&s;s the mountain with guides and lamps, or if he &s;taid in the vale 'till morning; but they replying they had orders to proceed, drove on; by this &s;he con|ceived her lovely inmate was &s;ome per&s;on of con|&s;equence in di&s;gui&s;e, and did not doubt but one day this &s;trange adventure would be cleared up; that &s;he pa&s;&s;ed by the name of Madam Lavinia de St. Clair, and was brought to bed of the charm|ing daughter he now beheld, to whom the enrap|tured parent gave the name of Ro&s;alie; but, alas! continued the worthy Giraldine, the dear affable lady was never cheerful, and a vi&s;ible and ha&s;ty decline &s;oon &s;ucceeded.</P>

<P>MOST part of the day was pa&s;t in viewing the beauties of the vale, and when the gold-empur|pled ray of evening &s;hed its parting gleam upon the mountains, a poor blind youth from a neigh|bouring hamlet playing on a fanta&s;tic pipe and ta|bor &s;oon &s;ummoned the cottagers to a little lawn&punc; where a ru&s;tic ballet was formed, to the great amu&s;ement of Lord Edwin, who, &s;eated on a di&s;|tant bench, enjoyed the innocent delight that manife&s;ted it&s;elf in each &s;miling countenance, and
<PB N="44" REF="029134_0042_0FDFAD0424341CB8">
when the piper and the villagers retired, the fa|mily turned into their cottage to partake of their &s;imple &s;upper which Giraldine had prepared, and at an early hour they &s;ought the &s;oothing in|&s;en&s;ibility of tranquil &s;lumber &s;acred to the &s;oul of peace.</P>
<P>The night was maje&s;tically beautiful, a &s;olemn &s;ilence prevailed&mdash;Lord Edwin gently opened his ca&s;ement, &s;ilvered by the moon, which exactly beamed on the miniature; a ru&s;tling gale agitated the poplars, and gently waved the dew-weighed heads of the full blown ro&s;es that encircled the chequered pane, and the perfume they exhaled was exqui&s;ite. Sleep's magic fillet could not veil his eye, Montague was hourly expected, Montague, the &s;teward of his father! 'Twas &s;trange! 'twas my&s;terious! He knew Montague con&s;tantly vi&s;it|ed Italy every &s;ummer, but he always under&s;tood his own private affairs demanded his attendance; his father too had been very circum&s;pect in his conduct, for he had never heard the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint that could awaken &s;u&s;picion, he would there|fore wait the event of Montague's arrival; and with &s;uch reflection he clo&s;ed his window, and re|tired to his cleanly coar&s;e pillow, 'till the voice of Ro&s;alie, and the trampling of mules under his window awakened him from his di&s;turbed and ir|regular &s;lumbers.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="029134_0043_0FDFAD05F4A58DE8">He was not long dre&s;&s;ing, for the voice of Mon|tague maddened his impatience, and faltering yet re&s;olute, he de&s;cended to the parlour, where the good old man had &s;eated Jo&s;ephine on his knee, and was an&s;wering her quick-repeated que&s;tions concerning a favourite lap-dog &s;he had given him la&s;t year, when the voice of Lord Edwin com|plimenting him jocularly on his &s;afe arrival at the cottage, petrified him to his chair. "You are a man of ta&s;te, Montague," cried he, "to prefer the ho&s;pitable reception of the&s;e worthy pea&s;ants in preference to any accommodation you could receive in the vale of Chamouny; Giral|dine's cream chee&s;es &s;uit your palate, Ro&s;alie's grapes are more lu&s;cious than any vineyard here produces, and the dried tongues and oat cakes of Madelon's preparing, are a mo&s;t inviting bon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouche to refre&s;h a fatigued traveller, hobbling over uncouth mountains purely through kindne&s;s to his relations."</P>
<P>A &s;arca&s;tic &s;mile accompanied the&s;e la&s;t words&punc; and Montague aba&s;hed and confounded, felt their full force on his cheek, where the flu&s;h of con|&s;cious duplicity indicated the explicit truth, as he faintly acknowledged that he frequently called as he pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Nay," replied Lord Edwin, "&s;pare tho&s;e lips the di&s;grace of a fal&s;ehood, we all know the

<P>LORD EDWIN then left the room with a countenance expre&s;&s;ive of unu&s;ual ferocity, and &s;uch as the faithful Montague during a &s;ervice of twenty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">five years had never &s;een clouded with the furious &s;torms of anger; for his young Lord he would readily have braved every danger, but to betray the confidence repo&s;ed in him by the Mar|quis, after being &s;o &s;trictly enjoined to &s;ecrecy, was a point of honour he could not reconcile him&s;elf to give up, and he conceived him&s;elf plunged in an inextricable labyrinth, yet as Lord Edwin had di&s;covered this charming protegee, and &s;eemed to be perfectly acquainted with great part of the affair, doubtle&s;s his information had been accidentally obtained from Giraldine or Ro|&s;alie, con&s;equently, on a moment's reflection, he concluded the Marquis could never reproach him for explaining the remainder, which would ever
<PB N="48" REF="029134_0046_0FDFAD0FC2F08C58">
reflect honour on him&s;elf, and could be no farther prejudice to Lord Edwin; he therefore determi|ned to di&s;clo&s;e every circum&s;tance within his knowledge, and leave the event to Providence.</P>
<P>He then &s;natched up his hat and cro&s;&s;ing the lawn entered the vineyard, where he beheld Lord Edwin reclining on a ru&s;tic bench, mi|nutely examining the miniature of Madame de St. Clair. "Come hither," &s;aid he, &s;eizing the arm of Montague with a degree of impetuous energy, "Do you know the original of this copy?" The poor old man (who knew an eva|&s;ive an&s;wer would only tend to irritate Lord Edwin) replied he had &s;een the lady who&s;e re|&s;emblance it bore, but did not know who &s;he was, or ever &s;hould." "Why not?" a&s;ked his Lord&s;hip, "you mu&s;t be more explicit; where did you fir&s;t &s;ee her, and, with whom?"</P>
<P>"With my Lord the Marquis," an&s;wered Montague, "about &s;eventeen years &s;ince, and all I know of the tran&s;action is, I was one evening at ten o'clock ordered to pack a &s;mall portman|teau, in con&s;equence of a letter my Lord had ju&s;t received from a private hand, which ap|peared to have agitated him greatly; the carri|age was immediately ordered with po&s;t hor&s;es, and my&s;elf the only per&s;on permitted to attend him, and we pur&s;ued our jour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey to Paris as
<PB N="49" REF="029134_0047_0FDFAD1188806058">
fa&s;t as carriages and ve&s;&s;els could carry us, but the Marquis ob&s;erved a &s;olemn &s;ilence the great|e&s;t part of the way, and when he did conde&s;cend to a&s;k a que&s;tion, 'twas &s;ullen and &s;nappi&s;h."</P>
<P>"At length we arrived at an ob&s;cure inn very late in the evening, where a very elegant lady faint|ed on my ma&s;ter's &s;houlder, and I was ordered by a French gentleman to leave the room; in half an hour fre&s;h hor&s;es were ordered, and the above lady and gentleman &s;tepped into the carriage with the Marquis, and drove quickly off.</P>
<P>Shall I confe&s;s my curio&s;ity was awakened, and I ventured to a&s;k Janette, the bar-maid, if &s;he knew the parties, but &s;he, poor girl, &s;poke very little Engli&s;h, and that in &s;o complicated a dialect, I could not gain one particle of the de&s;ired infor|mation, for they were perfect &s;trangers, and "Je ne &s;cais pas," was the prevalent an&s;wer from the Maitre d'Hotel to Le Valet d'Ecurie.</P>
<P>About three days after, the carriage &s;topped one evening at this cottage, good dame Giral|dine's candle would have been extingui&s;hed in another moment, (for the good folks were ju&s;t undre&s;&s;ing) when I was ordered to tap at the door, out popped the head of Reuben to inquire who di&s;turbed them, and the voice of M. Tourville
<PB N="50" REF="029134_0048_0FDFAD13418B2FF8">
from the carriage in&s;tantly brought him to the door.</P>
<P>"I know the remaining circum&s;tances of Ma|dame St. Clair's &s;tory, therefore abridge that part and proceed from the Marquis's departure." Montague bowed and continued.</P>
<P>We then returned to the confines of Paris, where we left M. Tourville and made the be&s;t of our way to England, where about five weeks after the Marquis's &s;i&s;ter, who was a nun in &s;ome convent, died, and the next po&s;t brought account of the death of Madame St. Clair. Ah! I &s;hall never forget being called into the Marquis's chamber; Montague, &s;aid he, poor Madame St. Clair has paid the debt of nature, after giving birth to a lovely daughter; I tru&s;t you have never revealed the circum&s;tances of our tour, or her departure from Paris, after the &s;ecrecy I enjoined you to ob&s;erve; you, and you only, are acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;wear you will never divulge the confidence I am going to repo&s;e in your bo&s;om, as it is of the utmo&s;t importance to be concealed at pre&s;ent; to your hands then I &s;hall remit proper &s;ums for the maintenance of this infant, to whom I am left guardian you &s;hall convey it every &s;ummer, and bring me proper information how &s;he is, and

when it is in my power to bring her to England, I &s;hall feel my&s;elf happy in having her under my more immediate care, which at pre&s;ent her infant &s;tate prevents me.</P>
<P>Such was the promi&s;e I engaged to fulfil, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as M. Tourville is very lately dead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> depute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to convey Mi&s;s Ro&s;alie to the ca&s;tle, and from thence to Thornley Abbey."</P>
<P>"To the &s;olitudes of Thornley," cried Lord Edwin, "is my father going to immure this blo&s;&s;om, amid&s;t the re&s;t of his &s;ecluded &s;weets, bu|ried in oblivion there?"</P>
<P>"Why &s;he was to have &s;taid at the ca&s;tle, but when I told the Marquis how hand&s;ome &s;he was, he in&s;tantly altered his mind."</P>
<P>"She goes to Thornley then," &s;aid he, "'till the departure of Edwin, for &s;hould he &s;ee her with the &s;ame partial eyes you do, I know not the con&s;equence, and then the mea&s;ure of my un|ea&s;ine&s;s would be complete."</P>
<P>"A charming plan," replied Lord Edwin, "but &s;ome deep my&s;tery remains, which I will endeavour to elucidate: Charming Ro&s;alie! if &s;he loves like me, no power on earth &s;hall &s;epa|rate us; take her to England, I will follow every

&s;tage in di&s;gui&s;e, to protect her, and by the time &s;he has inhabited the antique abbey about a week, I &s;hall make my formal entre, by popping in upon lady Mentoria and her fair companion, in the mid&s;t of their dinner, when lea&s;t expected."</P>
<P>"Mercy defend me," exclaimed Montague, "is it po&s;&s;ible my Lord will ri&s;k the Marquis's eternal di&s;plea&s;ure, by fixing his affection almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly on the very object his caution would conceal, and utmo&s;t vigilance &s;eparate?"</P>
<P>"Every remon&s;trance is vain," replied Lord Edwin, ri&s;ing ha&s;tily from his &s;eat, "I am going in &s;earch of Ro&s;alie, and in the mean time do you inform Giraldine." He then turned into the cottage, and found Ro&s;alie at her bu&s;y wheel. "Lay your &s;pinning a&s;ide," &s;aid he, "we mu&s;t have a few moments conver&s;ation: You are going to England, charming Ro&s;alie, with Montague, in two days, he has brought a letter expre&s;&s;ive of the Marquis's commands, and you mu&s;t obey them. Ro&s;alie involuntarily laid her hand on his arm, "Oh, my Lord, how &s;hall I reconcile my|&s;elf to leave this peaceful home, the&s;e dear-loved protectors of my infancy," and a tear trembled in her eye. "Make your&s;elf happy," replied Lord Edwin, "I will conduct you, &s;weet inno|cent, my arm &s;hall guard you &s;afe from every danger to the &s;hores of England."</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="029134_0051_0FDFAD1D6E19CDB8">"Ah no, my Lord, you je&s;t but with my &s;or|row, how is it po&s;&s;ible?" cried &s;he, cla&s;ping her hands, "at any rate, I am mo&s;t probably going to be &s;tationed in &s;ome menial capacity in the Marquis's family, for an orphan dependant on his bounty can expect little el&s;e, my gratitude then &s;hall lead me to obey with cheerfulne&s;s the commands of my benefactor; but the ta&s;k of parting will I fear much grieve poor Giraldine, &s;he is old, and I &s;hall never perhaps &s;ee her more."</P>
<P>Lord Edwin now found it nece&s;&s;ary to explain the my&s;tery, by declaring him&s;elf the &s;on of the Marquis, avowing his ardent love for her, and declaring &s;he alone &s;hould ever &s;hare his happi|ne&s;s. "Why then &s;o reluctant, &s;weet girl, more plea&s;ing pro&s;pects &s;hall unveil to your view, and the &s;un&s;hine of pro&s;perity &s;hall &s;hed its ray, and renovate my beauteous blo&s;&s;om though tran&s;plant|ed from its native &s;oil," and he ki&s;&s;ed the tear that fell upon her hand.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie appeared much agitated: "Alas! that I am every way unworthy the honour your Lord|&s;hip has conferred," &s;aid &s;he, "I am perfectly convinced, retract then your vow, my Lord, and view only with the eye of beneficent friend|&s;hip, the ill-fated cottager of Chamouny; ah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> why was I doomed to be the &s;port of capricious

If I &s;olicit to re|main with this happy family, I fear I &s;hall never enjoy the peace I once knew, for a continual dread of having offended my benefactor, and the idea of ingratitude to your Lord&s;hip would break my heart, yet per&s;i&s;t not in accompanying me to the Abbey, after the &s;trict injunctions the Mar|quis has enjoined Montague."</P>
<P>"Say not a word," replied Lord Edwin, "my plan is formed, and I am determined to execute it; go to Giraldine, who is appri&s;ed of your depar|ture, take only one dre&s;s with you, for Montague has orders to furni&s;h you with a genteel habili|ment as &s;oon as you arrive in England, and re|member when we meet at the Abbey nece&s;&s;ity will compel us to be &s;trangers 'till the my&s;tery of your parentage can be explained."</P>

<P>Again &s;he would have indulged a moment's re|flection, if the foot of Madelon had not rou&s;ed her reverie; &s;he opened the door, Madelon was in tears; &s;he ki&s;&s;ed the cheek of Ro&s;alie, and wept on her &s;houlder:&mdash;"Thur&s;day," &s;obbed &s;he, "we lo&s;e our dear &s;i&s;ter."</P>

&s;econd parting &s;cene, repelled the wi&s;h, and it was no more repeated.</P>
<P>Montague to hide his feelings, and prevent join|ing in conver&s;ation, had taken his &s;olitary &s;eat at the door: The prattle of Jo&s;ephine no longer en|livened him: Ro&s;alie's &s;pinning wheel cea&s;ed to turn: Madelon's little garden had not received its evening vi&s;itor's refre&s;hing care, to renovate and tie up the drooping plants, and Giraldine's ba&s;ket of knitting hung neglected on the branch of a ro&s;e tree that encircled the ca&s;ement.</P>
<P>Carlos mu&s;ing on the thoughts of his &s;eparation from Marcella, in like manner was no very live|ly companion to Montague; as he was pen&s;ively lolling over the gate of the vineyard, contem|plating the arrival of a group of pea&s;antry, who were advancing in proce&s;&s;ion, but not one &s;mile beamed on their countenance. They were come to take leave of Ro&s;alie, each had brought &s;ome little pledge of e&s;teem: A curious o&s;ier ba&s;ket, a pur&s;e, a pair of mittens, a &s;ilk net for her hair, a variegated pincu&s;hion, a curious jar of the choic|e&s;t honey, a few pomegranates, with various other trifles according to the age and di&s;tinction of the donor.</P>

<P>"A &s;imilar &s;hower may perhaps lave the flinty roads of Savoy," replied Montague, "'ere Car|los returns to England, and recounts the drops that fell in Chamouny."</P>
<P>The chord of &s;ympathy was touched, and its vibration was &s;trong and &s;evere. "Montague's raillery might amu&s;e and cheer our ho&s;pitable friends within," an&s;wered Carlos, "&s;uppo&s;e we &s;ee if we can render our&s;elves &s;erviceable?"</P>
<P>Montague a&s;&s;ented, and they turned into the cottage, where Ro&s;alie was packing her pre&s;ents in a &s;mall portmanteau, which, with a ba&s;ket of refre&s;hment, was to be fa&s;tened on Carlos's mule.
<PB N="60" REF="029134_0058_0FDFAD34D7E4A748">
Again and again they took leave, and retired to re&s;t, for the mules were to be &s;addled by &s;ix o'clock.</P>
<P>Sleep's magic fillet, &s;teeped in poppied e&s;&s;ence, for the fir&s;t time lo&s;t its power over the whole family.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the departure of Lord Edwin from the Ca&s;tle, the Marquis, as was his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, retired to his library&mdash;'twas much about the time Montague paid his annual vi&s;it to Chamouny, and a certain pre&s;entiment, in&s;tilled by apprehen|&s;ion, darted acro&s;s his imagination. "Gone to France, and means to pa&s;s through Italy," ex|claimed he as he &s;hut the door, "Ah! heaven avert he &s;hould di&s;cover the concealment of Ro|&s;alie, but &s;urely Edwin's di&s;po&s;ition is not &s;o ro|mantic as to &s;earch the ob&s;cure cottage to gratify his ta&s;te: No, no, the gallant and noble ance&s;try of his father will prevent my &s;on from falling in|to the errors of commonality."</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="029134_0060_0FDFAD38CFA45948">The Marquis's pride, which was ever his pre|dominant characteri&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, now reigned in full force, and ringing his bell with a degree of vio|lence, he ordered Montague to attend. The faithful &s;teward obeyed the &s;ummons: He was the cho&s;en regulator of the Marquis's plans, and had lived in the family twenty-five years, he was now in his fifty-&s;eventh year, beloved and re|&s;pected by every one in the family, and gratitude and obedience to his &s;uperiors, gentlene&s;s and courte&s;y to his fellow &s;ervants had gained him the e&s;teem he &s;o ju&s;tly merited; the mo&s;t implicit confidence &s;ealed his lip where nece&s;&s;ity required, and the mo&s;t noble &s;entiments of liberality and compa&s;&s;ion flowed from the dictates of his hone&s;t heart; he was &s;till active and diligent, though he was &s;tealing through the autumnal vale of life to the winter of a happy old age.</P>
<P>"Shut the door" &s;aid the Marquis, "and &s;it down," Montague obeyed in &s;ilence.&mdash;</P>
<P>"My &s;on is gone to Paris," re&s;umed he, "and as it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the time of your annual trip, I would have you in&s;tantly &s;et off, I have a &s;trange pre&s;age he &s;hould meet with Ro&s;alie: 'Tis time &s;he &s;hould be brought to England, and as I am now her &s;ole guardian, I &s;hall place her at Thornly, under the in&s;pection of Lady Mentoria Edwin, he will by that means never &s;ee her before his return from

<P>"Good my Lord," cried Montague &s;miling,
<Q>don't rai&s;e imaginary evils, for &s;hould Lord Edwin meet with her, who is to unraval the my&s;|tery known now only to God and your&s;elf?</Q></P>
<P>"Why true," an&s;wered the Marquis, "I did not reflect on that improbability: however, as the poor girl will be expecting you &s;et off on Thur&s;day, Edwin cannot reach that part of the world this fortnight, as he goes to Paris and makes &s;ome &s;tay: Here," continued he, open|ing his e&s;crutore, "is a &s;ufficient &s;um to defray all expen&s;es."</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h," &s;aid Montague, "the &s;weet lady, her mother was alive." The Marquis's colour mantled on his cheek, and he fetched a deep &s;igh. "I can a&s;&s;ure you," re&s;umed Montague, "Mi&s;s Ro&s;alie is far hand&s;omer than her mo|ther's picture." "Her mother's picture! cri|ed the Marquis how for God's &s;ake &s;hould &s;he come by it?" "Why Madam gave it to Giral|dine
<PB N="64" REF="029134_0062_0FDFAD41403ACEB0">
for the child when &s;he went to Montpelier," "I charge you then," &s;aid the Marquis, "the moment you arrive, to demand it in my name, &s;eal it in&s;tantly, and re&s;tore it &s;afe and un&s;een by mortal eye to my hand; go, Montague &s;trictly obey this injunction, and return &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible." He promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve his directions, bowed, and withdrew.</P>
<P>The Marquis remained &s;ome time ruminating, and then entered the breakfa&s;t parlour, where Lady Adela and Lady Loui&s;a were winding &s;ome cotton for their tambour, very much tangled: The Marquis &s;miled at their perplexity, "I am much in your &s;ituation, my dear girls," &s;aid he, "for I am about to unravel a delicate &s;kein, my&s;teriou&s;ly tangled."</P>
<P>Lady Loui&s;a let fall her hand to li&s;ten to the Marquis's &s;trange addre&s;s, and the winding cea&s;|ed. "What aenigma have you to puzzle us with, dear Sir" an&s;wered her lively Lady&s;hip, "do give us the mo&s;t ea&s;y clue to di&s;cover it, for real|ly our patience is almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, with this trouble&s;ome &s;kein."</P>
<P>"The my&s;tery I am going to unfold, my children, is not yet arrived at the proper cri&s;is of explanation, nor mu&s;t you require it 'till time

and opportunity permit me to di&s;clo&s;e the impor|tant &s;ecret."</P>
<P>"The lovely &s;i&s;ters involuntarily looked at each other in amaze. Adela then pen&s;ively ca&s;t her eyes on the ground, and waited the procedure, while Lady Loui&s;a more &s;u&s;ceptible, caught his hand, and fixing her fine eyes on his averted coun|tenance, cried, "Pray dear Sir, relieve our &s;u&s;|pen&s;e."</P>
<P>Expectation was on the wing, 'twas the mo|ment of explanation, as the veil of &s;ecrecy gent|ly devolved the my&s;tery long con&s;igned to the rece&s;s of faithful &s;ilence, a moment elap&s;ed, and the Marquis continued.</P>
<P>"I am going to introduce to your favour and protection a delicate plant, reared in an uncul|tivated &s;oil, though &s;prung from a rich and fer|tile &s;tem, which torn by the ruthle&s;s and capri|cious winds of fate, withered, drooped and di|ed, leaving to the more favourable breeze of hea|ven the nurture of its &s;ole-&s;urviving blo&s;&s;om; the &s;oil of Italy was de&s;tined to fear this de&s;o|lated flower, and now luxuriance and perfection mark the opening beauties of this tender vale|nur&s;ed lily, I &s;hall tran&s;plant it with a&s;&s;iduous care to the protection of my amiable daughters, cheri&s;hed by their fo&s;tering hand, it will, I tru&s;t, repay, with grateful blo&s;&s;om, their watch|ful attention&punc; Such is the plant I wi&s;h them to

<P>He cea&s;ed, and the &s;tarting tear that gli&s;tened in his eye, reflected back the chry&s;tal pendant that impearled the cheeks of his attentive audi|tors, but Lady Loui&s;a's dimpled &s;mile bani&s;hed the tear, 'twas the incen&s;e of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility from hearts who&s;e monitor was humanity.</P>
<P>"I perfectly under&s;tand you, my dear Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "and conceive the plant you have &s;o &s;weetly and intere&s;tedly de&s;cribed, partakes the &s;en&s;itive nature, if &s;o, when committed to the charge of Adela and my&s;elf, it &s;hall at lea&s;t be exempt from the rude pre&s;&s;ure of deri&s;ive in&s;en&s;i|bles, who&s;e unfeeling curio&s;ity might be tempted to cen&s;ure, where compa&s;&s;ion &s;hould predomi+nate."</P>
<P>"And after the inviolate &s;ecrecy which &s;eals our father's lip," replied Lady Adela, "his daughters will ever prove them&s;elves worthy the confidence repo&s;ed in them, by never &s;eeking to explore the &s;ecret unpermitted, 'tis &s;ufficient to

<P>The Marquis pre&s;&s;ed them to his bo&s;om, and, relying on their di&s;cretion, informed them he was guardian to the lovely orphan, that a genteel for|tune was left in his hands for her maintenance, and that he wi&s;hed every affection to be &s;hewn her as the relic of a friend dearly revered, but to whom he had &s;worn never to reveal her birth or connections 'till a convenient opportunity; he then wi&s;hed them a good morning and with|drew.</P>
<P>His hor&s;e was &s;oon after ordered, and he bow|ed to them as he cro&s;&s;ed the lawn &mdash; The charming &s;i&s;ters, left to their own reflection on this intere&s;t|ing &s;ubject, formed a thou&s;and conjectures; La|dy Adela wondered what friend's child it could be who&s;e concerns required &s;uch &s;trict &s;ecrecy. "I long to &s;ee her," &s;aid Lady Loui&s;a; "I &s;hould like to know if &s;he is hand&s;ome," continued &s;he, adju&s;ting her beautiful tre&s;&s;es through the &s;olds of her mu&s;lin turban, while a &s;park of envy dart|ed through her bo&s;om at the idea of a rival, though her natural &s;weetne&s;s of temper would have forgiven &s;uch a &s;uperiority, even to her mo&s;t inveterate enemy, yet the &s;ugge&s;tion was ve|ry apt in the bo&s;om of a young female.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="029134_0066_0FDFAD4D989EFE68">Sir Henry Lan&s;downe's elegant phaeton and four greys, at that moment cro&s;&s;ing the lawn, caught the eye of Lady Loui&s;a, "Good heavens!" exclaimed &s;he, "here is Sir Henry's greys enter|ing the gate, how &s;hall I e&s;cape, for po&s;itively he &s;hall not &s;ee me en di&s;habille, for as he is mo&s;t probably your &s;wain, and I am on my preferment, it may mar my fortune, and I &s;hould be &s;orry to interrupt &s;o charming a tete-a-tete, &s;o adieu, dear Adela." The window invitingly open to the garden was low, and Lady Loui&s;a in&s;tantly leaped out and flew for refuge to a rece&s;s in the &s;hrubbery.</P>
<P>Sir Henry enquiring for the fair fugitive, was told &s;he was dre&s;&s;ing; by the &s;ide of the window hung a beautiful land&s;cape, ju&s;t framed, which attracted his admiration, and he placed him&s;elf with his back to the light in order to view more accurately &s;ome beau|ty Lady Adela was pointing out, when turning to the window to enjoy the perfume of the gerani|ums that encircled it, he perceived a pale green &s;lipper hanging on the branch of a ro&s;e bu&s;h, with a &s;mall fragment of mu&s;lin floating on the briar.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me," cried he, "the owner of this &s;lip|per has encountered the thorns, whether in &s;earch of the ro&s;e I can't &s;ay, but &s;urely the fugitive, by leaving &s;uch evident traces had &s;ome particu|lar

<P>Lady Adela's cheek flu&s;hed crim&s;on: To have di&s;covered her &s;i&s;ter's retreat would have offended her, and yet the embarra&s;&s;ed &s;tate in which &s;he had &s;o precipitately left her demanded it, to ex|tricate her from the capability of rai&s;ing a fal&s;e|hood; Loui&s;a's &s;arca&s;m al&s;o of Sir Henry being her lover, had &s;o much deranged her for the moment, &s;he &s;carce knew how to receive him, and to be left tete-a-tete was a double mortification, for never had the &s;lighte&s;t partiality been vi&s;ible in his conduct to Lady Adela; on the contrary, &s;he had regarded her &s;i&s;ter as the object of his repeat|ed vi&s;its, and whil&s;t tho&s;e ideas crowded her imagination, &s;he &s;carce knew what an&s;wer to make.</P>
<P>"If the &s;lipper is yours," repeated he, "per|mit me to reach it." "Oh no," an&s;wered Lady Adela, 'tis Loui&s;a's, pray let it remain," catch|ing his &s;leeve as he &s;tept over the Dutche&s;s. "As 'tis Lady Loui&s;a's," &s;aid the delighted Lan&s;downe, I will venture to re&s;tore it." Lady Adela's vex|ation increa&s;ed, "Pray return, Sir Henry," cried &s;he, "probably Sylvio may have &s;tolen it from my &s;i&s;ter's dre&s;&s;ing room, he is very mi&s;|chievous." "Do you think he tore this tran&s;|parent

<P>The fact was now too evident to be denied, and Lady Adela could only intreat him to return; "For heaven's &s;ake, Sir Henry," cried &s;he, fly|ing to the door, and well knowing Loui&s;a could not be concealed far off, by the deprivation of her &s;lipper, "Stay, at lea&s;t 'till I have enquired if Andrew has removed the &s;teel traps."</P>
<P>"O, I fear them not," replied Lan&s;downe, bowing &s;aucily, and perfectly &s;eeing through this excellent &s;tratagem of his fair &s;uppliant, "traps of &s;teel nor chains of iron don't prevent my di&s;|covering the retreat of this lovely fugitive, be|&s;ides, as I have a pre&s;entiment &s;he has ju&s;t trod|den the path before me, tis mo&s;t probable from the &s;ilence which reigns &s;he has e&s;caped all &s;uch danger as your fears tend to magnify, or &s;hould &s;he have fallen the victim of &s;uch a di&s;a&s;ter, I will be the champion to extricate her, though a dra|gon guarded the &s;hrubbery; yet dont attempt to follow 'till I have explored every avenue to en|&s;ure your &s;afety," added he, with a &s;arca&s;tic &s;mile.</P>
<P>Lady Adela turned her head to conceal her too vi&s;ible confu&s;ion, while Lan&s;downe darting thro'

<P>In vain he peeped through every aperture, &s;he was not to be found; at length turning a corner into a very romantic &s;hade, called the wilderne&s;s, he caught the glimp&s;e of her gown darting &s;wift|ly round the trees, and turning through the fir&s;t path, &s;prung through a thicket of Suringo's, and caught the end of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, but his buckle un|fortunately entangling, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rightly prize &s;lip|ped the knot which confined the Per&s;ian to her wai&s;t, and leaving the trophy in his hand, reach|ed the hou&s;e before him, and flew to her dre&s;&s;ing|room.</P>
<P>Lady Adela followed her with a flu&s;h of an|ger on her countenance; "Is your ridiculous &s;camper over?" &s;aid &s;he to the breathle&s;s Loui&s;a, who had thrown her&s;elf on a couch, "never again, &s;i&s;ter, &s;ubject me to form friv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lous ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and when your folly is di&s;covered act in &s;o chil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a manner: What mu&s;t Sir Henry think of your behaviour; half undre&s;&s;ed, only one &s;lipper, and flying without the lea&s;t rea&s;on from a pur&s;uit &s;ure to overtake you; I have only to beg you'll adju&s;t your dre&s;s and de&s;cend to apologize for your im|prudence."</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="029134_0070_0FDFAD5925773F60">Lady Loui&s;a, who tenderly loved her &s;i&s;ter, felt the force of this conver&s;ation mo&s;t poignant, a reproach from Adela was a wound to her heart. "I have been guilty of a weakne&s;s," &s;aid &s;he, "but the intention was a harmle&s;s frolic;" and as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the gla&s;s the con|viction of her error from the appearance of her robe brought an involuntary tear in her eye: Adela's admonition was kind, thought &s;he, as &s;he de&s;cended the &s;tairs, and I will for the future &s;up|pre&s;s my volatile &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Agitated and vexed &s;he gently opened the door, Lady Adela nodded a &s;mile of approbation, and Sir Henry placed her on the &s;ofa: "Had Lady Loui&s;a attempted her agility in running for the celebrated apple, &s;he had &s;urely vanqui&s;hed the &s;wift footed Atalanta, and obtained the prize."</P>
<P>Lady Loui&s;a blu&s;hed: "Which of us do you think was mo&s;t to blame," cried &s;he, "me for flying you in this ridiculous race, or you for pur|&s;uing me when you mu&s;t naturally &s;uppo&s;e I had my rea&s;on for ab&s;enting my&s;elf, and I did not con|ceive my &s;i&s;ter's attractions &s;o few as not to be able to render you any amu&s;ement during my ab|&s;ence, and I hone&s;tly declare my flight wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he whim of the moment to elude curio&s;ity, how then could I imagine the polite Sir Henry would

have intruded on my retirement, by boldly in&s;i&s;t|ing on forcing me to di&s;cover my&s;elf when it was not agreeable."</P>
<P>Sir Henry &s;tung with the &s;everity of this la&s;t word, repelled as much as po&s;&s;ible, the fiery glance that darted in his eye. "To err is human," re|plied he, "to forgive divine; and as I now ap|peal to a divinity, who&s;e characteri&s;tic is com|pa&s;&s;ion and benevolence, thus let a &s;uppliant &s;ue for pardon," gracefully dropping on one knee, and pre&s;enting the &s;a&s;h and &s;lipper: "The ardent de&s;ire of having one peep at &s;o charming a fugi|tive, whom I had never con&s;ciou&s;ly offended, in|duced me to explore your retreat, one fa&s;cinating &s;mile &s;eals my pardon, and Lan&s;downe vows ne|ver to intrude again 'till the benignant eye of Lady Loui&s;a marks his fond wi&s;h, and permits him &s;o great an indulgence."</P>
<P>"Sir Henry's elegant apology has &s;ufficiently atoned for his frolic, and Loui&s;a tru&s;ts forgive|ne&s;s beams as &s;incerely in her eye as it expands in her heart." An eloquent look at that moment confirmed the reality of her addre&s;s, yet it conveyed to the bo&s;om of Lan&s;downe an idea not ea&s;ily for|gotten, for Sir Henry's partiality had long &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted, and he waited only to be a&s;&s;ured his hopes were not founded on a ba&s;ele&s;s fabric; thus the
<PB N="74" REF="029134_0072_0FDFAD5CA27E0460">
information he wi&s;hed to obtain he conceived the eloquent eyes of Lady Loui&s;a had powerfully ex|pre&s;t: That &s;he entertained a re&s;pectful e&s;teem was all he could at pre&s;ent flatter him&s;elf with, and as he well knew &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every &s;ocial vir|tue, he did not doubt but in time &s;ympathy would rai&s;e the &s;pirit of friend&s;hip to the exalted and &s;ervent pa&s;&s;ion of love, for every perfection, in his opinion, centered in this paragon of excel|lence, and if an error ever blazed in her conduct, it could only be imputed to a peculiar flow of good &s;pirits, the incen&s;e of a heart which knew no guile, and a quick &s;en&s;ibility and imagination unre&s;tricted by prudery or affectation: &s;he was youthful, innocent and gay, her heart had never known a pang of real &s;orrow, every hour had glided on the wing of happine&s;s, nor had &s;he ever been tempted to pluck the ro&s;e of love, con&s;e|quently its thorns had never wounded her bo&s;om.</P>

<P>THE re&s;t of the morning pa&s;&s;ed in chat 'till the Marquis's return, who, plea&s;ed with his vi|&s;itor, begged he would &s;tay to dinner, for Sir Henry, as the &s;on of his mo&s;t favourite youth|ful companion, who trod with him in childhood the paths of learning, always found a hearty in|vitation at the ca&s;tle: "About a fortnight hence," &s;aid the Marquis, "is the united birth-day of my daughters, which I intend to celebrate with all po&s;&s;ible fe&s;tivity; the neighbouring nobility and gentry will have general invitations, and the pea&s;antry &s;hall enjoy every harmony and plea&s;ure their hearts can wi&s;h; I intend to form a fete champetre, and your pre&s;ence will add to our felicity."</P>
<P>The high blood that flowed in the Marquis's veins had ever panted for an alliance with this noble youth, and he flattered him&s;elf one of his
<PB N="76" REF="029134_0074_0FDFAD6508995310">
daughters might be able to captivate, in his opi|nion, &s;o glorious a prize. The ample e&s;tate of Sir Henry, the elegant education he had receiv|ed, and improved to every advantage; the vir|tue of his ance&s;tors &s;hining in every action, and flowing in every &s;entence, had &s;o inflated the pride of the Marquis, that every hope re&s;ted on this fa|vorite &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Every elegance was preparing at the ca&s;tle, and the mo&s;t &s;umptuous luxuries procuring; every belle in the vicinity was racking her inven|tion to appear the mo&s;t attractive object, and not a dome&s;tic but equally enjoyed the delightful an|ticipation of the approaching fe&s;tival, and even the old gardener, who&s;e venerable locks &s;traggled in &s;ilvery threads on his wrinkled temples, was half per&s;uaded to &s;uffer his niece Agness, who was waiting maid to Lady Adela, to have them fa&s;ten|ed with a new black ribbon, and, wear a little powder on the occa&s;ion, but in vain did &s;he endea|vour to rally and tell him he would look &s;o young he &s;hould be her partner on the lawn.</P>
<P>"Don't teaze me Agnes," &s;aid he, "you nor any other female &s;hall ever have the honour of decking my head."</P>
<P>Agnes &s;miled for the moment at his &s;hrewd reply, yet as &s;he recollected her worthy uncle had once loved and met a &s;evere di&s;appointment, &s;he pitied
<PB N="77" REF="029134_0075_0FDFAD66D925B2C8">
him from her &s;oul, as &s;he was well convinced his attachment to a &s;ingle life had not ari&s;en from a froward di&s;po&s;ition, or an ab&s;olute aver&s;ion to the &s;ex in general, a &s;igh &s;acred to his &s;orrows e&s;caped her, and Andrew perhaps at that moment felt a &s;imilar &s;en&s;ation, as he walked &s;low and pen|&s;ively out of the &s;ervants hall.</P>
<P>"Well, I never liked old bachelors," &s;aid the little thin hou&s;e-keeper, drawing up her head and &s;moothing her apron, "but I mu&s;t &s;ay Andrew is the be&s;t tempered creature I ever lived with in my life, yet, as I often tell him, his genero|&s;ity out-runs his pocket, poor good &s;oul."</P>
<P>At this la&s;t ejaculation, uttered with a deep &s;igh, Agnes rai&s;ed her eyes and fixed them on Mrs. Gertrude's little grey orbs, peeping over the dark circles of an ancient pair of green-gla&s;s &s;pectacles.</P>
<P>"Was you ever in love?" a&s;ked the facetious Agnes, "or do you ever mean to marry?</P>
<P>"What is pa&s;t," cried the little notable dame, "bears no very plea&s;ing retro&s;pect, and what's to come one mu&s;t be more than mortal to de|vi&s;e."</P>
<P>"Why I can tell you," an&s;wered Agnes, de|termined to enjoy her frolic, and a&s;&s;uming the
<PB N="78" REF="029134_0076_0FDFAD688B756150">
predelictive air of a fortune-teller, earne&s;tly ga|zed on the palm of her hand&mdash;"What's to come is, Andrew&mdash;"</P>
<P>Gertrude &s;tarted and withdrew her hand, half angry, yet half determined to forgive&punc; "What of him for God's &s;ake."</P>
<P>"Nay," replied Agnes, having &s;lily ob&s;erved Andrew cro&s;&s;ing the lawn with a ba&s;ket of fruit, what would you wi&s;h more than a pre&s;ent of &s;ome peaches this morning, which I prophe&s;y will ar|rive in a few minutes for your acceptance."</P>
<P>Poor Gertrude, who had placed a different con|&s;truction on the fir&s;t hopeful words uttered by the mi&s;chief-loving Agnes, &s;carce knew how to extricate her&s;elf from the cen&s;ure her agitation had incurred, and therefore thought it mo&s;t proper to trip out of the room, and leave Agnes to receive the peaches and bearer; foralthough &s;he conceiv|ed her&s;elf much pa&s;t her prime, there was a degree of plea&s;ure in knowing her&s;elf e&s;teemed by &s;o worthy a man as Andrew &s;he could not forego.</P>
<P>"Love indeed" muttered &s;he to her&s;elf as &s;he trotted up &s;tairs, "I &s;hould be an old fool to be in love now a-days; to be &s;ure I have a great regard for Andrew, but I dare &s;ay he never had the lea&s;t thoughts of me more than civility."</P>
<P>Thus argued Gertrude, yet &s;he half wi&s;hed to per&s;uade her&s;elf Andrew's opinion might be dif|ferent
<PB N="79" REF="029134_0077_0FDFAD6AE25784E8">
to her conjecture, and as &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the looking gla&s;s vanity tapped her on the &s;houlder, and turning her head &s;he conceived a pin was &s;till wanting to adju&s;t her ribbon which probably had never been thought of if Agnes's bewitching con|ver&s;ation had not in&s;tilled the idea of attraction, but the bell ringing terminated her reflection, and &s;he bri&s;kly de&s;cended to obey its &s;ummons.</P>
<P>The Marquis had as yet received but one letter from his &s;on, and that arrived before he left Do|ver, and his &s;ilence was a my&s;tery he could not explain. "'Tis probable his friends engro&s;s &s;o much of his time," thought he, "that every hour not dedicated to them is devoted to refre&s;hing &s;lumber, to recover him from the exce&s;&s;es of di&s;&s;i|pation; yet methinks he might have &s;tole half an hour to gratify me, by hearing of his welfare; however, I tru&s;t as plea&s;ure is his pur&s;uit, pru|dence will conduct him &s;afe."</P>
<P>The day following brought him a &s;econd letter, expre&s;&s;ing Lord Edwin had changed his route, and had proceeded to Italy.</P>
<P>Had a &s;pectre, the mo&s;t horrible imagination could depict, pre&s;ented it&s;elf at that moment, it could not have produced a greater agitation than the Marquis experienced&mdash;every nerve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|brated, every feature was marked with gha&s;tly a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;the very project he wi&s;hed to &s;tifle in embryo had bur&s;t forth, and pre&s;ented the mo&s;t
<PB N="80" REF="029134_0078_0FDFAD70EBF65948">
formidable picture or vexation, tinged with the highe&s;t colouring the power of imagination could &s;hade. Yet Montague's late conver&s;ation dart|ed a ray of comfort and compo&s;ed his irritable mind.</P>
<P>When he met the ladies he &s;lightly mentioned the &s;ubject, by &s;aying Edwin was by this time in Italy. "Probably," &s;aid the lively Lady Loui|&s;a, "he may chance to meet our little Chamouny cottager."</P>
<P>The Marquis &s;hrunk with apprehen&s;ion;
<Q>if he does,</Q>
an&s;wered he unguardedly,
<Q>What im|pre&s;&s;ion could a pea&s;ant make on him?</Q></P>
<P>"Impre&s;&s;ion!" repeated the lively Loui&s;a, "Why, &s;uppo&s;e I was a hand&s;ome pea&s;ant-girl, and you a Marquis, a &s;light impre&s;&s;ion of the lip might be no great degradation, and as Edwin loves to contemplate beauty, &s;uch a circum&s;tance might occur."</P>
<P>Rage tinged the Marquis's cheek: "Ridicu|lous!" cried he, "Do you &s;uppo&s;e the girl would &s;uffer &s;uch an in&s;ult, or Montague permit it?"</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Lady Adela, "I cannot think a cot|tager would conceive it an in&s;ult; and as to Mon|tague's prevention, what are the remon&s;trances of
<PB N="81" REF="029134_0079_0FDFAD729D0788A8">
an old man to the ab&s;olute determinations of a young one, to whom obedience and re&s;pect demanded his &s;ilence,"</P>
<P>The &s;ting of an a&s;p had not more &s;everely wounded the bo&s;om, than this applicable &s;peech had the peace of the Marquis.</P>
<P>"I tru&s;t," &s;aid he, recovering his chagrine, "Ro&s;alie has too much good &s;en&s;e ever to make me &s;u&s;pect her of &s;uch an imprudence, much more that occular demon&s;tration &s;hould convince me the &s;ugge&s;tion was become a reality; &s;he is now cha&s;te as the un&s;ullied &s;now that crowns her native mountains, and it &s;hall be my care too warm a &s;un does not di&s;&s;olve and contaminate that purity it now &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>"If I &s;hould ever feel my&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to be in love," &s;aid the arch Loui&s;a, "I'd take a trip to Lapland, and bring home my heart &s;o thorough|ly chilled and ca&s;ed with an impenetrable &s;hield of ice, that &s;hould repel and defy the meridian beams of India's burning &s;un to di&s;&s;olve it."</P>
<P>"Time will convince us, Loui&s;a," re|turned the Marquis, "your intrepidity of being held captive, liberty is your motto, and a chain, even of gold, would be to you a galling fetter;
<PB N="82" REF="029134_0080_0FDFAD74637A3EB0">

<P>IT only wanted two days of the fete and the elegant arrangements of every device exhibited the ta&s;te of the ladies; innumerable fancies decorated every part of the ca&s;tle: Sir Henry Lan&s;downe, and his friend, Lord Carlton, &s;oon after arrived in the Baronet's elegant phaeton, and beautiful greys, followed by two &s;mart little lads in &s;car|let jackets and velvet caps, which rendered the equipage an intere&s;ting and charming object from the windows, but, alas! the ladies were not there to admire them as they da&s;hed over the lawn.</P>
<P>Lord Carlton's manly features lo&s;t their u&s;ual pen&s;oro&s;o on his arrival at the ca&s;tle: He was the darling &s;on of an Iri&s;h nobleman, well educated, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an ample fortune, and inferior to few
<PB N="83" REF="029134_0081_0FDFAD76C3307F70">
in gentility of deportment, elegance of addre&s;s, or amiability of di&s;po&s;ition, but when compared to the lively and &s;pirited Sir Henry, he was ju&s;tly and frequently &s;tiled the virtuous and benignant Mentor; and was his friend's &s;uperior in age, about two years, but the contra&s;t of their di&s;po|&s;itions entitled them to the difference of ten.</P>
<P>The elegant Lady Adela and fa&s;cinating Loui&s;a, were &s;trolling on the arm of the Marquis, in a di&s;tant avenue of the &s;hrubbery, when Sir Henry and Lord Carlton advanced to meet them.</P>
<P>They were dre&s;&s;ed in their morning mu&s;lin robes, their hair wildly di&s;ordered by the wind, waved on their &s;houlders in irregular luxuriance, while the beams of the &s;un ca&s;t a plea&s;ing reflection on their beautiful features, through the texture of &s;mall chip hats negligently fa&s;tened with a plain ribbon; on the arm of Lady Loui&s;a hung a ba&s;ket of flowers ju&s;t &s;elected from the green-hou&s;e, while the delicate fingers of Lady Adela twined through the wires of a &s;mall cage that impri&s;oned an exqui&s;ite Virginia nightingale, which &s;he was removing from a too &s;ultry &s;ituation in a porti|co of oranges, where its enchanting &s;ong delight|ed every li&s;tening ear.</P>
<P>Lord Carlton held the arm of his friend: "One moments pau&s;e, Lan&s;downe," cried he "to con|template
<PB N="84" REF="029134_0082_0FDFAD7D02946A68">
the mo&s;t charming group I ever beheld: are tho&s;e the divinities I am to be introduced to? And which is the lovely godde&s;s at who&s;e &s;hrine you wor&s;hip? What elegance and beauty! Me|thinks had there been one more, my fancy had not unju&s;tly conceived the graces had &s;trolled to this charming &s;pot; that little floral deity &s;eems to tread on air, as if her magic feet would &s;corn to cru&s;h the blo&s;&s;oms that invade her path, while the maje&s;tic and graceful carriage of the other pre&s;ents one with the expre&s;&s;ive re&s;emblance, of the dignified Minerva, each reclined on the arm of a venerable and benignant &s;age, who &s;eems di&s;|pen&s;ing &s;miles and happine&s;s, blended no doubt with &s;ome precept of in&s;truction, as appears by his pointed finger and earne&s;t conver&s;ation."</P>
<P>"Why, Carlton, you are quite in heroics this morning," an&s;wered Sir Henry, "but recollect you are to &s;acrifice only at the &s;hrine of Minerva, for that angelic Hebe, Flora, Thalia, or what you plea&s;e to call her, is alone dedicated to wing each hour with ro&s;y bli&s;s for Lan&s;downe's future days, but they approach, and you &s;hall judge far|ther."</P>
<P>"My friend, Lord Carlton, Sir," continued he, pre&s;enting him to the Marquis, "of whom impartially conver&s;ing your goodne&s;s permitted me to introduce."</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="029134_0083_0FDFAD7EBAA35E28">The Marquis cordially extended his hand, and politely welcomed him to the ca&s;tle, while a glow of confu&s;ion embarra&s;&s;ed the ladies at the &s;urpri&s;e of &s;o unexpected a vi&s;itor.</P>
<P>Carlton ventured a glance at the forbidden fruit, thought its temptation delicious, and im|mediately fixed his eyes on the &s;erene features of Lady Adela, offering to convey the cage into the hou&s;e, a politene&s;s acknowledged by a graceful compliment quite her own.</P>
<P>"Sweet pri&s;oner," cried he, admiring his beautiful plumage, "captivity with thee mu&s;t lo&s;e its rigours, the attention of thy lovely mi&s;|tre&s;s &s;urely repays thy lo&s;s of liberty; fed by her gentle hand, and courted by her dulcet voice to warble thy &s;weet note, who would not envy thee, gay &s;ong&s;tre&s;s?"</P>
<P>Lady Adela &s;miled. "His native clime had &s;urely yet more charms, my Lord, where liber|ty, delightful liberty, was all his own, when at the evening hour he &s;weetly poured his plaintive melody, to hail his mate within the well known grove, but now captivity de&s;ires tho&s;e joys the little &s;olitaire &s;oftly diver&s;ifies his notes with tender thrilling &s;trains, which oft' to fancy's ear &s;eems to repeat &s;ome mournful plaint of &s;epa|rated love."</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="029134_0084_0FDFAD806FED2E28">Carlton was delighted with the &s;weet beam of compa&s;&s;ion that animated her countenance, each &s;entiment &s;eemed &s;o congenial to his own, and her &s;oft and plea&s;ing addre&s;s rendered her the more captivating object of his e&s;teem, whil&s;t in the conver&s;ation of Lady Loui&s;a he conceived he could di&s;tingui&s;h a predominance of levity, though bia&s;&s;ed by extreme politene&s;s and affabi|lity: Such were the impartial ideas he formed of each, and Lord Carlton's opinion &s;eldom de|viated from the mo&s;t favourable yet real points of true di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t plea&s;ing conver&s;e beguiled that day, and on the third the natal morn was u&s;hured in by the five twinkling bells from the &s;teeple of the romantic church about half a mile di&s;tant. A public breakfa&s;t in the Park commenced the fete, and the company a&s;&s;embled in elegant di&s;habille, numerous tables were &s;pread under the &s;hade of &s;ome venerable maje&s;tically-towering elms, while a band of mu&s;ic artfully concealed amid the luxurance of a portico of oranges and odo|riferous &s;hrubs, at once delighted and &s;urpri&s;ed; profu&s;ive refre&s;hments and delicacies furni&s;hed a &s;uperb dejune, and the repa&s;t ended at two o'clock, when an elegant gondola with flags, bearing the Marquis's arms, decorated with &s;e|veral emblematic devices, and cu&s;hions of pale blue &s;attin covered the &s;eats to receive the

delightful group, who cho&s;e to enjoy the refre&s;hing breezes, under an awning on the &s;pa|cious canal, to the &s;oft notes of the enchanting horn.</P>
<P>Others, whom timidity prevented joining the aquatic group, rapaired to a Turki&s;h marquee, purpo&s;ely erected for an accommodative &s;hade to the ladies, as &s;pectators of a &s;elect company of gentlemen, who were to exert their &s;kill in ar|chery to obtain the &s;ilver arrow, and the rich bu|gle horn, prizes be&s;towed on the conqueror by the lovely directre&s;&s;es of the amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>The tent was compo&s;ed of buff and green &s;attin in broad &s;tripes, looped at the entrance by large ta&s;&s;els of &s;ilver, and fe&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons of bullion fringe; on the top was placed a &s;uperb &s;un of variegated luminous colours, that kept in perpetual moti|on, and produced a beautiful effect; &s;ofas of corre&s;pondent &s;attin were placed on the in&s;ide, whil&s;t various en&s;ignas of archery &s;u&s;pended on falls of white &s;attin that lined the marquee.

archers' party, whil&s;t Lady Adela, in compli|ment to the re&s;t of the a&s;&s;emblage, took her &s;eat in the gondola.</P>
<P>The dre&s;&s;es of the lovely &s;i&s;ters were exactly alike: loo&s;e Grecian robes of tran&s;parent French lawn over &s;ar&s;enet petticoats, the wai&s;t and &s;leeves cla&s;ped with bands of pearls, and their beautiful tre&s;&s;es &s;haded only by a veil of the &s;ame texture, thrown gracefully back and fa&s;tened with a lily of pearls, while the lower fall de&s;cended to the wai&s;t and joined the ce&s;tus. The &s;implicity and becomingne&s;s of this elegant di&s;habille is &s;carcely conceivable, and the &s;ublimity of their countenances heightened by their charming blu&s;h|es created by the encomiums of the company, ve|ry aptly entitled them to the Duche&s;s of Montre|ville's remark, who ob&s;erved, they re&s;embled the expre&s;s character of ve&s;tal virgins, both from their real di&s;po&s;itions and negligently graceful dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Two hours thus devoted completed the morn|ing amu&s;ement, and the company retired to dre&s;s for the ma&s;ked ball in the evening. The grand drawing-room was hung on the occa&s;ion with white &s;attin, over which in various forms &s;u&s;pend|ed wreaths of ro&s;es, while columns of variegated foils entwined with oak leaves and golden wheat divided the compartments: Three &s;uperb chande|liers

<P>On a portion of the lawn was erected a platform for the dancers, &s;hould the evening prove fine, and beautiful Luna in compliment &s;hed her mo&s;t refulgent beam to invite the harmonious and &s;prightly group: innumerable lamps were &s;u&s;|pended and encircled the trees, which almo&s;t uni|ting at the top formed a vernal canopy, inter|cepted through the waving branches by contra&s;t|ing moon-light: To complete the picture&s;que &s;ylvan &s;cene, a band of mu&s;ic &s;tationed in a di&s;tant pavilion, and the beautifully illuminated grotto immediately oppo&s;ite acro&s;s the lake, furni&s;hed an intere&s;ting object of admiration to the dancers, for the reflecting mirrors, burni&s;hed fo&s;&s;ils, &s;hells

<P>Sir Henry &s;upported the character of a pilgrim &mdash;Lord Carlton a magician&mdash;the Hon. Frederic Waldegrave, as cupid, with an elegant bow and arrows tipt with gold, which he dexterou&s;ly di|rected to every youthful female, while to the mar|ried ladies he di&s;tributed fetters of ro&s;es, which he a&s;&s;ured them "were thornle&s;s." One arrow only mi&s;&s;ed its aim, it was levelled at an elegant nun, her foot &s;tepped on it, and its texture being light and brittle, it &s;napped, and di&s;concerted the &s;ly archer.</P>
<P>"I never refuge an enemy," cried the Relige|u&s;e; "although no enchantre&s;s, I po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;pell more powerful than your arrow, gentle Cupid, 'tis a heart defying thy magic, becau&s;e every re|ce&s;s is guarded by rea&s;on, thy mo&s;t dreaded foe; take thy aim amid the circles of gallantry, for my devoted &s;i&s;terhood &s;hrink from thee, vain boy, and every thought &s;oars &s;uperior to thy influence." Cupid obediently drew the &s;ilken bandage acro&s;s his eyes, and mingled with the group.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="029134_0090_0FDFAD94622030D8">A flower-girl next addre&s;&s;ed the magician, to explain her fortune: "Beauty," an&s;wered he, "fades like the blo&s;&s;oms in thy ba&s;ket, ca&s;t them away and &s;elect others, among which choo&s;e the aloe, to watch its bloom will teach thee patience&punc; add the blo&s;&s;oms of time, and place next to them the ro&s;e of happine&s;s, carefully dividing the thorn from the heart's-ea&s;e, mingle the evergreens of truth and fidelity, and pre&s;ent the &s;election to the mo&s;t generous purcha&s;er." Promi&s;&s;ing to ob&s;erve his advice, &s;he tripped away.</P>
<P>A beautiful figure of Hope courted univer&s;al-admiration, who proved to be Lady Adela. "Wilt thou, &s;weet maid, by thy magic in&s;pira|tion, deign to lighten my burthen?" a&s;ked Cupid. "Apply to prudence to fledge your arrows, and beg con&s;tancy to &s;tep them in her pure&s;t e&s;&s;ence, and my be&s;t exertion &s;hall effectually crown your wi&s;hes," an&s;wered &s;he.</P>
<P>The pilgrim next addre&s;&s;ed her. "Whither are you wandering bare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">? a&s;ked the elegant enchantre&s;s, leaning in pen&s;ive attitude on a &s;uperb anchor, "Do you prefer the thorny paths of &s;uper&s;tition? or do you only affect to deceive us in your pretended pilgrimage?

<P>As he glided away, Lady Loui&s;a's appearance, as the godde&s;s of fortune with her &s;plendid wheel drew the whole a&s;&s;embly's admiration, and her dulcet voice in&s;tantly claimed attention. "I have &s;elected a few prizes," &s;aid &s;he, "the keep-&s;akes of hope and fortune, which I &s;hall di&s;|tribute as chance directs, the humble memorials of this day."</P>
<P>A &s;ultana advanced and the fickle deity pre|&s;ented the wheel, from which &s;he drew a card, which adjudged her the embroidered handkerchief; a general congratulation was whi&s;pered round on the applicable prize, but as prudence and mode&s;ty &s;ealed the lip of the donor, animadver&s;ion cea&s;ed. Numerous elegant bagatelles were di&s;tributed among the motley group, and each party, highly delighted with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olite remembrance, trea&s;ured the little gift as an e&s;timable memorial of friend|&s;hip and re&s;pect.</P>

<P>The utmo&s;t decorum had been ob&s;erved by the dome&s;tics and pea&s;antry, who had equally enjoy|ed the evening by dancing on the back lawn, to the enlivening pipe and tabor, where Mrs. Ger|trude conde&s;cended to lead down the fir&s;t dance with Andrew, to the no &s;mall diver&s;ion of Wil|&s;on and the Marquis's valet.</P>

<P>LORD EDWIN and his lovely protegee pur&s;ued their journey over the mountains and environs for &s;everal days, 'till they reached the cottage of Marcella, where they re&s;ted and par|took &s;ome humble refre&s;hment, while Carlos again repeated his faithful adieus.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="029134_0093_0FDFAD9AD6EF2F70">The &s;pot that &s;urrounded the cottage was ro|mantically beautiful; from the protruding &s;ides of the mountains depended clu&s;ters of the purple vintage in rich fe&s;toons, while in various parts of the acclevity the traces of the plough divided the velvet &s;lopes, between who&s;e cha&s;ms lofty water-falls in diamond &s;howers &s;pangled the ob|truding &s;hrubs and flowers with its radiant cry&s;|tals, as morn in &s;affron ve&s;ture tinted with her reflected orient beam the waving pines, that clad the mountain &s;teep.</P>
<P>Marcella bade a thou&s;and adieus as &s;he wiped the intruding tear on the corner of her apron; her &s;pinning was placed at the door, and as the mules &s;lowly paced on &s;he took her &s;eat, her head re&s;ted on the arm that &s;upported the in|active &s;pindle, while her eyes were fixed on the le&s;&s;ening objects, and the hand that lay in her lap &s;till held the little gold cro&s;s, the trea&s;ured keep-&s;ake of her lover, con&s;ecrated with the heart-&s;prung tears that &s;aved its burni&s;hed &s;ides.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie involuntarily looked back a few paces di&s;tance; Carlos was transfixed to his mule a &s;tatue of de&s;pair, gazing a la&s;t look with an ex|tended hand that meant to wave, but the im|pul&s;e of activity was &s;u&s;pended and the u&s;ele&s;s limb dropped by his &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="029134_0094_0FDFADA081CC4808">"Poor fellow," &s;aid Ro&s;alie, her fine eyes ab&s;orbed in the tear of &s;en&s;ibility, "the&s;e are un|feigned &s;orrows of the heart."</P>
<P>"I pity them from my &s;oul," added the benig|nant Lord Edwin, "Carlos in general po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great fortitude, yet I find he is not proof to the innovations of love."</P>
<P>No particular circum&s;tance occurred worthy ob&s;ervation 'till they arrived at Dieppe, where Carlos humbly petitioned to be&s;tow his mite by a young female mendicant, in&s;tinctively &s;topped to li&s;ten to the voice of di&s;tre&s;s, while Mademoi&s;elle Ro&s;alie and his Lord&s;hip were taking lemonade vis-a-vis in a &s;mall room from whence they could ob&s;erve his motion.</P>
<P>"Ah, the poor unfortunate," &s;aid Carlos &s;earch|ing his pocket for a few &s;ous, very willingly drawn, while &s;he pre&s;ented a &s;mall ba&s;ket of tooth|pics, "Le Souvenir," &s;aid Carlos, mode&s;tly tak|ing one, "I &s;hall take this trifle to England, and when I look on it I &s;hall be reminded of Janette: But I will not look to explore &s;orrows it is not in my power to alleviate&mdash;Adieu then, the tear that in &s;pite of every effort to retain it bedews my cheek, is the incen&s;e of a heart that has nothing more to give, yet 'tis con&s;ecrated to the child of mi&s;ery."</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="029134_0095_0FDFADA25936F4C0">Jannette's tear mingled her thanks as &s;he walk|ed pen&s;ively on, and Carlos with folded arms &s;tood contemplating her neat figure, and wa&s;ted a &s;igh to her &s;orrows 'till the voice of Lord Edwin ten|dering him a few Louis rou&s;ed him, and he light|ly &s;kipped after Jannette, and chucking them into her ba&s;ket pointed to his Lord&s;hip and returned.</P>
<P>Jannette curt&s;ied low three times, and tying her little fortune up in a &s;mall leather pur&s;e, looked earne&s;tly at it, cla&s;ped her hands, and rai&s;ed her eyes in &s;ilent ejaculation to heaven for the unex|pected bounty of the benevolent &s;trangers, put it in her pocket, wiped another tear, yet another &s;till &s;ucceeded, 'twas the drop of &s;incere gratitude, it would intrude&mdash;the feelings of nature were not to be commanded, and the tooth-pick girl po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed them refined only by the hand that planted, not nurtured them, yet were they eminently imita|tive, and her expre&s;&s;ive eyes had repeated the whole hi&s;tory of her misfortunes to Carlos, with|out one &s;yllable e&s;caping her lips; eloquent re|vealers, beaming the impartial truth, though oft|en pre&s;&s;ed by ba&s;hful mode&s;ty to conceal the unpi|tied &s;orrows they relate, yet &s;weet compa&s;&s;ion marks the timid glance, and joys to cheer the &s;ad dejected eye long wandering o'er the gloomy che|quered land&s;cape &s;haded by tempe&s;tuous clouds of human life.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="029134_0096_0FDFADA406808918">The packet in which the travellers were to &s;ail for England was very full, and Ro&s;alie drew her veil clo&s;e over her face, while Lord Edwin wrapped him&s;elf in a large cloak, and permitted his fine dark hair to &s;hade his countenance, as a di&s;gui&s;e more favourable to his &s;tratagem, and which &s;o much altered his features as to elude the re&s;emblance he formerly bore the family, and as Signior Carlini and La Bella Ro&s;ara his &s;i&s;ter, they took their &s;eats in the cabin.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie &s;oon found the motion of the boi&s;terous wave agitate her &s;tomach, and &s;he fainted on the &s;houlder of Lord Edwin: This indi&s;po&s;ition &s;o alarmed him that he had nearly thrown off his di&s;|gui&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, and bearing her in his arms on deck for the benefit of air, blundered over a young buck who impeded the pa&s;&s;age, and unfortunate|ly trod on the gouty foot of an old moro&s;e bache|lor, which compliment was returned by a hearty oath and a violent thru&s;t. "Manners, you brute; have you no compa&s;&s;ion you fri&s;king Ita|lian devil?" exclaimed he, limping into the ca|bin.</P>
<P>Lord Edwin enraged at this invective, now thought proper to addre&s;s him in the Engli&s;h language, and in fact to procure &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the lovely burthen now &s;en&s;ele&s;s in his arms. "I &s;hall teach you manners, friend," cried he,
<PB N="99" REF="029134_0097_0FDFADA689B62908">
"when I come down again, at pre&s;ent I am too much engaged in the charge of my &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P>"Si&s;ter?" exclaimed the buck &s;arca&s;tically &s;neering, "A mighty polite brother, methinks if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a little more manners for &s;trangers it would better become him; Oh, 'tis an ab&s;olute boar to be treated thus, my hair, my coat, my neckcloth bear te&s;timony of the &s;avage's feroci|ty."</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t words echoing in the ear of a &s;tiff-&s;tarched little old maid, in&s;tantly made her bu&s;tle up. "Mercy defend us, a boar in the packet did you &s;ay, Sir? Gracious God! the fierce creature may tear us all to pieces, I hope he is chained; I would not have come for the world if I had known it."</P>
<P>"Oh you need not be alarmed, replied the buck, taking her brown &s;hrivelled arm and &s;eating her again, "it is only a two legged &s;avage, that has cau&s;ed this confu&s;ion, by &s;tumbling over half a dozen of us with his prey in his paw."</P>
<P>"A &s;avage with his prey?" reiterated the prim virgin, who&s;e &s;tupidity could not under|&s;tand his rhodomontade, "what is it any thing like a monkey?"</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="029134_0098_0FDFAEC3E71CDCF8">"Oh yes! returned he, enjoying the joke at at her expence, while her features &s;tiffened with terror, "It certainly is of that <HI>&s;pecie,</HI> though it &s;tiles it&s;elf a man; in &s;hort to calm your fears, Madam, 'tis the famous Signior, who has ju&s;t left the cabin: I am &s;ure if my &s;i&s;ter, like his, had &s;hammed dead, I &s;hould not have thought proper to clamber up with her weight at the danger of my own legs, and cru&s;h half a dozen others.</P>
<P>"Aye, aye, you are right," cried old &s;quare toes, "&s;elf-pre&s;ervation is the fir&s;t law of nature, I never ri&s;ked my precious limbs gadding after a parcel of pert toads, not I, fal-lal dangling non|&s;en&s;e."</P>
<P>By this time the antiquated Mi&s;s had drawn a &s;mall ca&s;e bottle from her pocket, declaring her &s;tomach, in con&s;equence of the flurry &s;he had ju&s;t experienced, to be rather qualmi&s;h, and &s;trongly recommended the old gentleman to ta&s;te it, a&s;&s;ur|ing him it was very fine and unadulterated.</P>
<P>"It may, Madam," replied he, "but I am no dram drinker, however I thank you for your of|fer."</P>
<P>The little dame reddened with vexation, the odium of a dram-drinker had not e&s;caped her no|tice. "Old churl," muttered &s;he, applying it to
<PB N="101" REF="029134_0099_0FDF6DC86B71EAF0">
her lips, and &s;wallowing a &s;mall but u&s;ual porti|on&punc; again con&s;igned it to the bottom of her long pocket.</P>
<P>Lord Edwin had now left Montague and Carlos to attend Ro&s;alie, as &s;he preferred &s;itting on deck, while he de&s;cended in &s;earch of the two choleric gentleman he had &s;o unintentionally offended.</P>
<P>"I hope your &s;i&s;ter is better, Signior," a&s;ked the buck, with the mo&s;t &s;arca&s;tic effrontery.</P>
<P>Lord Edwin &s;urveyed him from head to foot with an air of the mo&s;t &s;overeign contempt, and then pa&s;&s;ed on to the old codger, "I am come to apologize as a gentleman to you, Sir, if in the hurry of conveying my &s;i&s;ter up I was &s;o unfor|tunate to do you an injury, but you mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I add, the ha&s;ty and ill-mannerly retaliated thru&s;t and oath ill became a per&s;on of your years, and which perhaps makes me draw a conclu&s;ion of your birth and education probably unju&s;t, but for which you mu&s;t thank your&s;elf: for the acci|dent I readily apologize, and I hope, as my &s;enior, you will be induced politely to pardon, and ac|knowledge the ungentleman-like expre&s;&s;ions you made u&s;e of where the re&s;ult of a moment's pa&s;&s;ion, urged by an unlucky pre&s;&s;ure of your lame foot, which I am &s;orry &s;hould have felt an additional pang from me."</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="029134_0100_0FDF6DC9F97EA0C0">"As for you, Sir," added he, turning to the young man, "I conceive far too contemptible a per&s;on to conver&s;e with, a mere compo&s;ition of malice, foppery, and ignorance, quite beneath the notice of a gentleman."</P>
<P>To this addre&s;s the pitiful &s;park thought fit to make no other reply than a &s;arca&s;tic &s;mile, and humming a tune&punc; marched out of the cabbin, &s;ecretly mortified at betraying his folly; while the old gentleman finding Montague and Carlos de&s;|cending to receive the Signior's orders, began to think his companion of more con&s;equence than he at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected, and therefore extended his hand in token of forgivene&s;s, which Lord Edwin's placid benignity accepted, and animo&s;ity cea&s;ed on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>His curio&s;ity being rou&s;ed, the old gentleman determined to try what he could make of the &s;er|vants, as he had an inconceivable partiality to high connection, being a rich but mi&s;erly Don; he therefore watched the Signior's ab&s;ence to accom|pli&s;h his &s;cheme, and fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed Montague with enquiring where his ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s were going.</P>
<P>"To England of cour&s;e," replied the cautious dome&s;tic.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="029134_0101_0FDFADABA009A900">"Ah pray, friend, where might they la&s;t come from?"</P>
<P>"Paris," an&s;wered Montague, conning over the news-paper.</P>
<P>"Humph!" cried the old man, "that I knew before, but tell me if they are brother and &s;i&s;ter; whether people of con&s;equence, fortune or note in the gay world, and where they re&s;ide in Eng|land; come let's hear, let's enjoy half an hour's chat over a tiff of punch."</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me, Sir," &s;aid Montague, "I have not lived in the Signior's family twenty-five years, to turn tattler in my old age, and evince my&s;elf unworthy the confidence ever repo&s;ed in me, and which I have faithfully &s;upported."</P>
<P>"Nay," cried the other, reddening with pa&s;&s;ion at the baulk of his project, "there's no harm in a civil que&s;tion, it mu&s;t be a matter of indifference to me to know who your ma&s;ter is, and if I had not taken a liken to him, I &s;hould not have trou|bled my head about him, pray is he married?"</P>
<P>Montague uttered his favourite mono&s;yllable, and the di&s;appointed enquirer walked away. Pa&s;|&s;ing the door of the lower cabin he e&s;pyed Carlos, "I hope your Lady's better," &s;aid the intruder,

taking a &s;eat, "and your ma&s;ter too &s;eems a mighty affable plea&s;ant companion, and a warm one too, I dare &s;ay.</P>
<P>"Why yes," an&s;wered Carlos, &s;eeing the drift of his impertinent curio&s;ity, "few men more &s;o; 'tis warmi&s;h weather in our country."</P>
<P>"Aye you fly rogue," cried he tapping his his &s;houlder, and &s;agaciou&s;ly winking, "I mean warm in the pocket."</P>
<P>"Perfectly &s;o, and in every other re&s;pect," rejoined Carlos, "for genero&s;ity warms his hand, friend&s;hip his heart, virtue and gratitude his &s;oul, while compa&s;&s;ion blazes in his eye for every child of misfortune, and the cottage that &s;helters the victim of poverty feels the warmth of his benefi|cence in the blaze of the cheering faggots that form his little fire."</P>
<P>By every artful kind of &s;tratagem did the old gentleman &s;trive to obtain the wi&s;hed intelligence, but Carlos's ingenuity evaded every po&s;&s;ible di&s;co|very and he left him to his own contemplation."</P>
<P>Finding him&s;elf baffled and derided, he again ventured to the cabin, where he con&s;oled him&s;elf with &s;moaking a pipe, to the annoyance of &s;eve|ral females, who&s;e coughs and whi&s;per were lit|tle

<P>A plump dame &s;urrounded by three &s;huffling boys, complained loudly of the offen&s;ive tobacco. "Bobby will certainly be &s;ick," cried &s;he, hug|ging up a ro&s;y cheeked chub, the expre&s;s image of her&s;elf, "you mu&s;t either go a top of the deck, Sir, or I in&s;i&s;t the window &s;hall be open, for we &s;hall be poi&s;oned and &s;tifled alive, as bad as thof we were &s;tuffed in the black-hole at <HI>Calcoretta</HI> What d'ye callum place, I &s;hall be a fine figure by the time I gets to <HI>Brightham&s;ted;</HI> this is my la&s;t clean apron, and it looks rare and <HI>&s;mudgey,</HI> be|&s;ide we &s;hall &s;mell like pole-cats; God ble&s;s Bob|by, he's &s;ick as death."</P>
<P>"If Bobby had &s;tuffed le&s;s cold goo&s;e ju&s;t now, his &s;tomach would have been in a better &s;tate to bear the&s;e whole&s;ome fumes," cried the old gen|tleman, "&s;o a natural ca&s;cade won't do him much harm, pop him upon deck he'll do very well."</P>
<P>"Who a&s;ked your advice, &s;quire nettletop?" returned &s;he, clawing up the boy on one hip and waddling out of the cabin.</P>
<P>"Lord Edwin and Ro&s;alie were &s;eated on deck, praying for the hour that would di&s;cover the long expected &s;hore, and free them from the di&s;gu&s;ting

<P>Lord Edwin was now obliged to leave his fair charge, after pa&s;&s;ing two days, and the third morn|ing Ro&s;alie was to proceed to the ca&s;tle.

<P>MONTAGUE had been ordered by the Mar|quis to appri&s;e him of their arrival at Brighton, which injunction being punctually obeyed, the family where anxiou&s;ly awaiting the appointed hour&mdash;the morning had pa&s;&s;ed and the traveller not arrived. The Marquis &s;trolled with his daughters to a pavilion in the park, a beautiful edifice erected and ornamented entirely to the ta&s;te of the fair &s;i&s;ters&punc; Its form was octagon, and the columns that &s;upported it of curious marble, and a flight of &s;teps with white and gold railing led to the Portico, the door of which was inlaid with pannals of looking-gla&s;s, reflecting the beautiful pro&s;pect, and deluding the eye with an imaginary view through the pavilion, which produced a charming effect. The window opened in the Ital|an &s;tile, lattices of green wire &s;upported the clu&s;|tering ro&s;es that encircled one window, while as
<PB N="109" REF="029134_0107_0FDFADBB9CB46380">
round the oppo&s;ite one luxuriant pa&s;&s;ion-flowers corre&s;ponded their beautiful &s;hade.</P>
<P>The door opening di&s;covered a &s;pacious room, around who&s;e &s;ides in various rece&s;&s;es the mu&s;es were beautifully repre&s;ented; in one part an elegant piano forte, in another a noble library, while va|rious capital drawings, the performance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy Adela, embelli&s;hed the compartments: Before the chimney was rai&s;ed a &s;tage filled with exotics. The Virginia Philomel, &s;u&s;pended at a third win|dow over a bowl of gold-fi&s;h; and at a fourth was fixed to a camera-ob&s;cura. The matting which covered the centre of the floor was com|po&s;ed of coloured &s;traw, wove to the fancy in va|rious devices, and formed by the fair hands of the ladies, a charming &s;pecimen of their ta&s;te and abilities: Several pieces of embroidery, cloth, bead, fillagree, and various other curious per|formances were arranged in different &s;ituations, and the delighted Marquis had given it the ap|pellation of "the Pavillion of ingenuity."</P>
<P>Boundle&s;s was the land&s;cape on either &s;ide, and from this delightful retreat Lady Adela's pencil traced the picture&s;que beauties of nature; here they con&s;tantly devoted &s;everal hours every morning, to indulge the wanderings of fancy, while &s;ome new invention formed an admirable chief d'ouvre from the fertility of their imagination, which furni&s;h|ed them a continual &s;ource of amu&s;ement.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="029134_0108_0FDFADBE0C911250">'Twas here the Marquis had taken a book at one of the windows, while Lady Adela was adding the la&s;t tints to a beautiful land&s;cape, and Lady Loui&s;a practi&s;ing a new Italian air, on her piano, when Montague opened the door of the pavilion and pre&s;ented Ro&s;alie.</P>
<P>The Marquis &s;tarted and the book dropped&mdash; the ladies in&s;tantly ro&s;e and conducted her to their father, where the lovely girl re&s;pectfully dropped on one knee, and &s;uffu&s;ed in blu&s;hes rai&s;|ed her fine eyes ab&s;orbed in tears, as the Marquis pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and bid her ri&s;e.</P>
<P>"My noble generous protector," cried the charming creature, "May the ill-fated girl your bounty has cheri&s;hed, reward, by her grateful af|fection, the duty &s;he owes her benefactor, long may &s;he &s;hare the tender affection he has faithful|ly &s;hewn her helple&s;s infancy, &s;acred to the me|mory of an honored parent once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his fa|vour and e&s;teem."</P>
<P>The Marquis cla&s;ped her hand, "Grateful Ro|&s;alie," replied he, "the memory of thy valued mother &s;teals from me an avowal of equal affec|tion for her lovely child, come then to my bo&s;om and receive that ble&s;&s;ing and protection no longer hers to be&s;tow, while her angelic form hovers over us, and guards thee pure and &s;potle&s;s as her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed &s;pirit."</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="029134_0109_0FDFADC414095D30">"But I mu&s;t leave you, my children, for a &s;hort interval, Ro&s;alie St. Clair is &s;o expre&s;sly the image of her lovely mother, that it recalls a thou&s;and painfully-plea&s;ing ideas to my memory: You never knew the amiable lady St. Clair, my &s;weet girls, but as the friend of thy father receive with &s;i&s;terly affection her haple&s;s orphan, may you ever be united in an indi&s;&s;oluble band of love, and may happine&s;s continually wave her banner round you."</P>
<P>He then retired from the pavilion to his libra|ry, and &s;ummoned Montague, from whom he re|ceived the miniature carefully &s;ealed, which he in&s;tantly opened, and beheld indeed the mo&s;t accu|rate re&s;emblance of his adored Lavinia; thrice he pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips, and then con&s;igned it to the inmo&s;t rece&s;s of his e&s;crutore, enclo&s;ed in a packet of papers, expre&s;&s;ing every particular of of the birth of Ro&s;alie, with &s;everal letters from Lady Lavinia, the&s;e were carefully &s;ealed with the Marquis's arms, and directed for Ro&s;alie."</P>
<P>"At my decea&s;e, Montague," &s;aid he, clo&s;ing the drawer, "The&s;e papers will explain the pre&s;ent my&s;tery, and my &s;acred promi&s;e will re|main unbroke, the faithful vow has never been revealed hy the lip of Augu&s;tus, and the angel who records it on the page of futurity &s;hall never &s;tain it with a blot."</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="029134_0110_0FDFADC6A6F58E78">"I think too I have totally prevented Edwin &s;eeing her, he may now traver&s;e Chamouny and not excite one fear in my bo&s;om."</P>
<P>Montague trembled at the idea of inve&s;tiga|tion, but as the Marquis did not imagine he had met his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, the &s;ubject was not mentioned, and Montague was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with orders to &s;ummon the ladies to tea, happy to have e&s;caped advancing a fal&s;ehood, though had nece&s;&s;ity compelled him, he mu&s;t have &s;ubmitted to the action of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">plicity, by concealing the fact, to pre&s;erve Lord Edwin's happine&s;s.</P>
<P>So delighted were the charming &s;i&s;ters with their new companion, that the cot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ger of Cha|mouny, in their opinion, was metamorpho&s;ed to the godde&s;s of innocence and heavenly complai|&s;ance; her &s;oul was congenial to their own, and fortune &s;eemed to have pre&s;ented them the friend they had long &s;ought.

while benignity beamed in every countenance at the ca&s;tle, and welcomed her with the unfeigned &s;mile of &s;incerity.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the green-hou&s;e, Andrew, who&s;e curi|o&s;ity was ever alive, was purpo&s;ely refre&s;hing his blooming parterre, and on their approach had gathered a beautiful ro&s;e, from which his ru&s;ty &s;ci&s;&s;ars were clipping the thorns, "Would the lady do me the honour to accept a ro&s;e?" a&s;ked he, making a low bow, while his &s;ilver-threaded locks waved on his &s;un-burnt cheek.</P>
<P>Gratefully, friend," an&s;wered &s;he placing it in her bo&s;om. Andrew bowed as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;h of plea|&s;ure cro&s;&s;ed his cheek.</P>
<P>"I &s;ubjoin this lily," cried Lady Loui&s;a, gathering o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e that at the in&s;tant courted her hand, "Ro&s;e et Lis," added &s;he, "will for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ature be my favourite &s;election, I &s;hall place them on the left &s;ide of my bo&s;om, and I tru&s;t they'll not fade. Lady Adela complimented the bon mot, and Ro&s;alie's blu&s;h outvied the bloom|ing pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Returning to the hou&s;e they were met in the hall by Mrs. Gertrude, Agnes, and Wil&s;on, the attendant of Lady Loui&s;a, to whom the news of Mademoi&s;elle's arrival had been announced by

<P>"No great things!" &s;aid Le Brun, the Mar|quis's valet, &s;ignificantly &s;hrugging his &s;houlders, and elevating his broad black eye-brows, as he carele&s;sly threw him&s;elf acro&s;s a chair, and treat|ed him&s;elf with a pinch of &s;nuff; "No hauteur I'll allow, but mightily devoid of the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e je ne &s;cais quoi, we people of fa&s;hion are &s;o noted for di&s;playing in &s;tile, what do you think ma petite Wil&s;on, I'll bet your black &s;parklers again&s;t her in&s;ipid blue eyes ten to one."</P>

Palemon's genero&s;ity impre&s;&s;ed the idea of Lord Edwin, and the cha|racter of Lavinia &s;eemed nearly incident to her own: She &s;hut the book, and rai&s;ing her eyes per|ceived Andrew &s;tedfa&s;tly gazing in apparent a|&s;toni&s;hment at the tear &s;he thought private and imperceptibly &s;hed, and a &s;igh e&s;caped her, which was an&s;wered by an involuntary re&s;pon&s;ive one from Andrew, as he de&s;cended the ladder with his &s;hears and ba&s;ket.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie touched the guitar, but not knowing its art hung it up again. A port folio of draw|ings lay open on the table, and &s;he ventured to peep at a few, when turning the leaves, the wind being very bri&s;k, wafted a &s;mall vellum medal|lion into a thicket of woodbines. Terrified and fearful another breeze &s;hould catch it, &s;he ha&s;|tened down the &s;teps to regain it, but what was her delight and &s;urpri&s;e on beholding the mo&s;t perfect re&s;emblance of Lord Edwin, &s;ketched by the pencil of his &s;i&s;ter. "Ine&s;timable trea&s;ure!"
<PB N="122" REF="029134_0120_0FDFADE4C6F92BE8">
cried &s;he, "would I dared &s;teal thee, or that I could trace &s;uch another, but that's impo&s;&s;ible, yet would Lady Adela conde&s;cend to in&s;truct me, I do think by con&s;tant practice I &s;hould &s;oon be able to make an humble attempt, and if &s;o, it &s;hall be the fir&s;t favour I &s;olicit; however incapable I may be of attaining any degree of perfection, I will at lea&s;t exert my be&s;t endeavours."</P>
<P>Again &s;he examined every feature and then replac|ed it exactly in the &s;ame &s;ituation, when turning a few more leaves a profile drawing of Lady Loui&s;a pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and the dre&s;s being &s;omewhat &s;imi|lar to her mother's miniature, reminded her of the Marquis'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unkindly depriving her of it, without ever a&s;&s;igning any rea&s;on to her.</P>
<P>The hour of nine was now proclaimed by the clock from the chapel, an elegant edifice for the private u&s;e of the family, erected on an eminence in the park, terminating in a grove of lofty elms, and forming a mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;pectacle from the windows of the ca&s;tle, and reminding her it was time to return to the breakfa&s;t parlour, where &s;he found the family ju&s;t a&s;&s;embling: Ro&s;alie blu&s;h|ing beautiful as the enchanting morning, curt&s;ied and took her &s;eat."</P>
<P>"If you enjoy the delightful breezes of the morning, I don't know why you &s;hould &s;teal the

<P>"Indeed Ladies I am alone indebted to the &s;ame di&s;pen&s;er of bloom that reared tho&s;e ro&s;es, bounti|ful Providence, who tinted their leaves with beauty, flu&s;hed my cheek with healthy; I have been up the&s;e two hours amu&s;ing my&s;elf in the pa|vilion with &s;ome elegant poems, which &s;o much intere&s;ted my attention&punc; did not regard the hour 'till the chapel clock warned me to return.</P>

<P>"Extremely &s;o," replied Ro&s;alie, and my guar|dian. M.

<P><PB N="124" REF="029134_0122_0FDFADED47E9C5A8">Ro&s;alie wiped away a tear of affection to his memory, and the Marquis forgot to drink his chocolate, while he li&s;tened with &s;ilent rapture to the &s;entiments of his lovely protegee.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Villars will be here by two o'clock," &s;aid Lady Adela, "and in the mean time we will employ our morning in the pavilion, where you &s;hall &s;ee my drawings and Loui&s;a's embroidery and tambour, and which ever you prefer we will with plea&s;ure in&s;truct you in."</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie readily acknowledged her partiality to the crayon, and al&s;o to obtain &s;ome in&s;truction on the guitar. "I have a beautiful lute up &s;tairs," &s;aid &s;he, "the valued pre&s;ent of a friend at Chamouny."</P>
<P>"Oh, fetch it by all means," &s;aid Lady Lou|i&s;a, "it will have a charming effect in the pa|vilion, and you mu&s;t indulge us."</P>

<P>SOFTLY &s;weet the plaintive &s;train broke on the attentive ear, and &s;he played with exqui&s;ite ta&s;te a pa&s;toral air, who&s;e beautiful &s;implicity de|lighted Lady Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>'Pray who taught you, Ro&s;alie?" a&s;ked &s;he, charmed with her ta&s;te and execution.</P>
<P>"Lindor, the mountaineer," replied Ro&s;alie, "the humble admirer of Madelon, con&s;equently ever e&s;teemed by me: Madelon could not learn, indeed &s;he had not time, but my fancy was ever &s;o delighted and in&s;pired by mu&s;ic that I begged Lin|dor to become my in&s;tructor: Oh! how did I u&s;e to long for the hour of evening, that brought our lively youth to the cottage."</P>
<P>"Giraldine then took her knitting to the little bench at the door, Madelon and I pur&s;ued our &s;pinning, Jo&s;ephine wound our cotton, while Reu|ben

Thus pa&s;&s;ed the hours in inno|cent amu&s;ement 'till the ri&s;ing moon warned him to depart, and as it lighted him home &s;ilvered the pain of our little ca&s;ement, and guided us by its clear and beautiful beam to our pillows.</P>
<P>"Charming ru&s;ticity!" exclaimed Lady Adela, "I am delighted with your de&s;cription." At that moment one of the windows became &s;haded, and Sir Henry tapped at it, mounted on Andrew's &s;hort ladder, which &s;tood invitingly fixed, had been forgot to be removed, and climbing up with the agility of a &s;quirrel, he popped in his head, but &s;eeing Ro&s;alie coming to remove a &s;tand of flowers to facilitate his entrance, he drew back, begging pardon for his abrupt intru&s;ion, not ex|pecting to meet the eye of a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>"Pray &s;tep in," &s;aid Lady Loui&s;a, "Sir Hen|ry's temerity &s;eldom finds an ob&s;tacle his ingenu|ity and addre&s;s cannot &s;urmount, and as a fluent and eloquent apology would be no puni&s;hment to him to repeat impromptu, do not let us be depriv|ed of it&mdash;on tho&s;e conditions we pardon, there|fore make an elegant entree."</P>
<P>Sir Henry obeyed. "I tru&s;t," &s;aid he, Lady Loui&s;a will not deem it an impropriety to follow a good example, and as ladies now-a-days &s;hew

their dexterity in leaping out of windows, it is but proper gentlemen &s;hould keep them in coun|tenance, by evincing their agility in climbing in; do not then blame a &s;elf-rai&s;ed action, charming fair; Mi&s;s Villars and her beaus are ju&s;t behind, and probably they may be inclin|ed to try the &s;ame method by way of novel exerci&s;e."</P>
<P>"How ridiculous!" &s;aid Lady Loui&s;a, turn|ing half angrily away.</P>
<P>At that moment a loud peal of laughter bur&s;t from the &s;hrubbery, and Mi&s;s Villars, her brother, Colonel Ardvine, and Lord Carlton a&s;cended to the pavilion; Mi&s;s Villars took her &s;eat on the &s;teps, declaring &s;he was tired to death, and too hot be &s;tived up in a clo&s;e room, "So let me alone, Ardvine, you tire&s;ome toad," continued &s;he, &s;tretching out her legs three parts di&s;played, "Do unlace my boot, I have hurt my ancle, and the confinement makes it painful.</P>
<P>Shocked at her indelicacy, Ro&s;alie politely of|fered her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>"No, thank you, an&s;wered the Amazon, with her arms cro&s;&s;ed and her foot extended to the Co|lonel, "Ardvine is a very u&s;eful animal on &s;uch occa&s;ions, I will not trouble you."</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="029134_0126_0FDFADF8C1224880">Then leering at Lord Carleton in a half whi&s;|per, "I pre&s;ume this blu&s;hing Mi&s;s is the Mar|quis's ward I lately heard of, quite a compo&s;ition of in&s;ipidity methinks, good eyes enough too, but not the lea&s;t tincture of vivacity about them, mere|ly as if God had placed them in her head only to look with, not to expre&s;s the pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul, moves like clock-work, or as if the poor thing was afraid of damaging a ba&s;ket of eggs every time &s;he &s;teps or turns round."</P>
<P>This &s;peech fini&s;hed by a toni&s;h &s;tare of impu|dence, accompanied with a rude loud laugh, much irritated Lord Carlton.</P>
<P>"Upon my word," replied he, "you are very &s;evere, Mi&s;s Villars, and in my opi|nion where 'tis quite needle&s;s, I have heard much of Mi&s;s St. Clair's beauty and &s;en&s;ibility, and I confe&s;s I think the de&s;cription of the former by no means partial, nor do I conceive I &s;hall be much di&s;appointed in the latter, at lea&s;t from ap|pearances, however I &s;hall draw no har&s;h conclu|&s;ions, nor &s;uffer my&s;elf to be bia&s;&s;ed by &s;o tran|&s;ient a view, my motto is "lenity," and I always cautiou&s;ly avoid cen&s;ure, lea&s;t I incur the charac|ter of a malicious &s;candalizer; and were I a fe|male, the idea of envy might al&s;o be attached; for, alas! that is become &s;o glaring and predomi|nant a pa&s;&s;ion with them, that it moulds every vir|tue
<PB N="129" REF="029134_0127_0FDFADFA7A795470">
to its own jaundiced impre&s;&s;ion: for, like a nettle planted by a ro&s;e, you cannot attempt to admire or touch its innocent beauty but you feel the &s;ting of its malicious and envious competitor, who, con&s;cious of its inattractive powers, waves its poi&s;on to contaminate the harmle&s;s blo&s;&s;om, and undermines its tender leaves where lea&s;t &s;u&s;|pected; If &s;uch a weed rankles in the bo&s;om of Ro|&s;alie St. Clair, Ethelbert Carlton will endeavour to eradicate its pernicious root. Mi&s;s Villars may applaud or condemn his morality, but a mo|ment's reflection will convince her the lecture, however, unplea&s;ing, is founded on truth, and I tru&s;t her candour and good &s;en&s;e will coincide to clear him from the imputation of prejudice or ri|gidity to the errors of levity."</P>
<P>This fervently addre&s;&s;ed &s;peech by no means plea&s;ed his auditor. "I think," cried &s;he, Carl|ton would write a mighty good &s;ermon, and if he will make an attempt to preach it al&s;o, I will con|de&s;cend to nod &s;ome Sunday afternoon in an op|po&s;ite pew, for the &s;ake of a moralizing dream."</P>
<P>Lord Carlton, di&s;gu&s;ted with her in&s;olent re|tort, walked away, and took his &s;eat by Lady A|dela, and Mi&s;s Villars finding her&s;elf abandoned by the beaus, &s;oon after entered the pavilion, with her boot in one hand and her hat in the other, and without regarding the pre&s;ence of any one, ran

up to the gla&s;s to admire her blowzy appearance&punc; while the officious Colonel, a petite maitre, fol|lowed clo&s;e behind. "Your charming tre&s;&s;es &s;ont derange, ma dee&s;&s;e," cried he.</P>
<P>"Well then, plat them up again," replied &s;he, "I believe I &s;hall be cropped for Newmarket, it will be &s;o convenient to hunt too with Lord Edwin. Ah! a-propos, when does he return?</P>
<P>"Very &s;hortly," an&s;wered Lady Adela, "but he means to &s;ell his fine hunter, for the la&s;t chace was &s;o infringed on by the farmers, whom Edwin did not like to reprove, that it rendered it di&s;a|greeable, and as he is not very partial to that cruel diver&s;ion, he was ea&s;ily prevailed on to give it up.</P>
<P>A &s;econd glance at the mirror di&s;covered a fault in the adju&s;tment of her neck-cloth and off it came, folded in an enormous &s;tuffing and two ex|tra handkerchiefs. Thus far undre&s;&s;ed, it was nece&s;&s;ary to enquire if the lady wi&s;hed to make any other alteration, while the charming &s;i&s;ters, reddened with confu&s;ion, begged &s;he would retire to their dre&s;&s;ing room, where Agnes &s;hould attend her; but, lo&s;t to every impul&s;e of delicacy, and a perfect adept of a&s;&s;urance, &s;he undauntedly re|plied, "&s;he &s;hould &s;oon fini&s;h."

<P>They &s;oon after adjourned to the &s;table to give their opinion of a fine hor&s;e late|ly purcha&s;ed, in who&s;e commendation Mi&s;s Vil|lars was very eloquent, to the no &s;mall amu&s;e|ment of the grooms, to whom &s;he made &s;everal ob&s;ervations: They then returned to the hou&s;e to take chocolate, and departed, earne&s;tly entreat|ing the ladies to favour her with their company at the villa, but cautiou&s;ly avoided inviting Ro|&s;alie, whom &s;he treated with the very e&s;&s;ence of hauteur, and making her only a &s;light inclination of her head en-pa&s;&s;ant, mounted her hor&s;e and let off in full trot for a wager with the Colonel.</P>
<P>Many and various were the opinions concern|ing Mi&s;s Villars:&mdash;To the men &s;he was a gene|ral object of deri&s;ion&mdash;to the women a di&s;gu&s;ting Amazonian: Yet, even while they viewed her conduct, carried to a pitch of ab&s;urdity, their le|nient bo&s;oms could not help pitying her errors.

and ill-nature, was her perfect character. yet though her behaviour warranted every free|dom, her virtue caught the mo&s;t tran&s;ient alarm.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fine fortune and the only daugh|ter of a noble family, every one bowed to the dic|tates of Georgina, and thus trained up in the practice of &s;elf-will, could it be wondered &s;he now reigned the haughty tyrant of uncontrouled power.</P>
<P>The fair &s;i&s;ters beheld her with di&s;gu&s;t; &s;he was by no means a plea&s;ing a&s;&s;ociate, who&s;e a&s;pir|ing virtues could direct or emulate their own, yet as Mr. Villars, her father, was a man of general ac|quaintance and re&s;pectability, and frequently vi|&s;ited at the ca&s;tle from bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure, it was nece&s;&s;ary to be di&s;tantly polite to his daughter, who occa&s;ionally intruded, but &s;eldom had her vi|&s;its returned; yet to the ladies &s;he always behav|ed as polite and friendly as her irritable temper would permit.</P>

<P>A FEW days elap&s;ed when a letter from Lord Edwin announced his intended arrival at the ca&s;tle in three or four days. The Marquis in&s;tantly planned a &s;cheme of &s;ending Ro&s;alie to the abbey&punc; where the Dowager lady Mentoria had retired about three weeks &s;ince; he wi&s;hed not to &s;end his daughters, as Edwin might probably be incli|ned to pay them a vi&s;it, yet to &s;uffer her to travel &s;ixty miles alone would be improper, and as it was not in her power to accompany her without a de|gree of &s;u&s;picion ari&s;ing, he determined Montague &s;hould convey her: and le&s;t his daughters &s;hould embarra&s;s him by enquiring the rea&s;on of her ha&s;ty departure, he re&s;olved to give them a &s;light intimation of his &s;u&s;picions, by telling them, he begged they would never encourage Edwin in any &s;uch ideas of Ro&s;alie, on pain of his eternal di&s;plea&s;ure: this they faithfully promi&s;ed, and ha&s;tened to the chamber of Ro&s;alie, informing her

&s;ome friends were expected at the Ca&s;tle in a day or two, for who&s;e accommodation her apartment would be wanted, and it was the Marquis's wi&s;h &s;he &s;hould go on a vi&s;it to the Abbey during their &s;tay, for &s;ome private rea&s;ons they could not a&s;&s;ign.</P>
<P>"When our vi&s;itors are gone" &s;aid Lady Ade|la, "we will come and partake your &s;ociety at Thornley, where our good aunt will make you an excellent companion, her &s;pacious library will &s;erve to amu&s;e you. and your lute will &s;ound &s;weetly, and delight Lady Mentoria in her &s;e|que&s;tered &s;hades, while, various other amu&s;ements will charm the fleeting hours and not leave you a languid moment."</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie bowed obedience with a heart far more inclined to undertake her journey than they &s;u&s;|pected, and in the evening &s;tepping into the Mar|quis's po&s;t chariot and four, &s;he &s;et off blithe and happy, waving her hand in re&s;pectful adieus as the carriage drove down the avenue, and the Mar|quis felt a degree of plea&s;ure tempered by the hope of &s;ecurity, as he watched the carriage out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>The evening of the &s;econd day &s;hewed her the turrets of the Abbey peeping through the ivy that encircled their ba&s;is, and the thick and gloomy-&s;hading plantations that embo&s;omed the gothic

pile: the lambent fires of day darted a burni&s;hed gleam on the high arched windows, and eve's la&s;t ro&s;y tints were ju&s;t expiring, while ruby &s;hadows in fanta&s;tic forms played in the empurpled we&s;t, and the wild poet of the glade joined her &s;oft dul|cet note to animate the pa&s;&s;ing woodman's rural &s;ong, who, homeward trudging to his little cottage in the neighbouring hamlet, di&s;placed the com|fortable pipe to chaunt his ru&s;tic ballad, and mo|ved his tattered hat in token of civility to the lovely &s;tranger.</P>
<P>The element was &s;erenely beautiful, innumera|ble fleecy clouds, tinged with &s;oft golden fluid, in fanta&s;tic forms floated on the azured canopy, and in the wide expan&s;e of aether the moon's tran&s;parent &s;ilver-&s;eeming ma&s;k peeped forth its my&s;tic and refulgent form.</P>
<P>At length the chai&s;e &s;topped at the antique porch; pondrous arches &s;upported the ma&s;&s;y fa|bric, and from the ivy-twined pillars deep &s;e|creted the little chearful robin peeped his head and hailed the &s;tranger with a welcome &s;ong. The ma&s;&s;y hinges ho&s;pitably opened, and received the timid gue&s;t.</P>
<P>Montague conducted her through a &s;pacious hall of black marble, while on the ancient carved pan|nels innumerable warlike trophies were &s;u&s;pended,

the memorials of at lea&s;t two centuries; the &s;o|lemn gloom and the &s;ound of her own feet echoing up the great &s;tair-ca&s;e made her &s;hudder, and &s;he clo&s;ely followed Montague, not daring to turn her head, pa&s;&s;ing through a long range of gallery, and peeping into &s;everal large apartments, Mon|tague opened an enormous door and Ro&s;alie &s;tart|ed.</P>
<P>On a high chair of crim&s;on velvet, curiou&s;ly cut, &s;at Lady Mentoria; a diminutive figure about &s;eventy-&s;ix: habited in a rich brown tabby &s;acque and treble ruffles with a &s;hort black lace apron and hood&punc; &s;he aro&s;e and politely &s;aluted her fair gue&s;t, who pre&s;ented a letter from the Marquis, which the Dowager read with attention, often glancing a look at Ro&s;alie, who was &s;urvey|ing with a&s;toni&s;hment the pondrous window frames and dark wain&s;cot, again&s;t who&s;e chequered pan|nel &s;everal family portraits in lumbering frames &s;tarted their gruff countenances, and chilled her beating heart.</P>

<P>The hour of retiring drew nigh, and Lady Mentoria, with the alacrity of youths tripped along the gallery, and led Ro&s;alie to her apart|ment, where wi&s;hing her refre&s;hing &s;lumbers &s;he withdrew.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie left alone began to examine every part of her &s;pacious chamber; the ceiling was vaulted, and grote&s;que characters repre&s;ented on its damp-di&s;coloured &s;urface exhibited the mo&s;t hideous and non-de&s;cript creatures: The windows were ex|tremely high and arched in the old-fa&s;hioned ca|thedral &s;tile, darkened at top with &s;everal pains of &s;tained gla&s;s, one only opened low enough to obtain a view of the garden; &s;he drew up the dark green dama&s;k curtain that &s;haded it, and

threw up the &s;a&s;h to take a &s;urvey of what the trembling moonlight's palid beam would permit her to di&s;cover through the thick branches of &s;ha|ding trees, that appeared to bound a portion of park, or lawn; all was &s;ilent but the hoar&s;e voice of a Newfoundland dog, from the porter's lodge, that growled occa&s;ionally; &s;he now drew down the heavy frame and began to undre&s;s.</P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the room &s;tood a high an|tique bed, who&s;e fringed canopy &s;u&s;pended from the ceiling by tarni&s;h brackets; the hangings of the room were faded tape&s;try, repre&s;enting the famous &s;iege of Troy, but as Ro&s;alie was totally unacquainted with the heathen mythology, &s;he was ignorant of what it was.</P>
<P>Her wax taper now burnt dim and increa&s;ed the gloom, her heart beat quick and irregular, and &s;he would have given the world for a compa|nion: Something at that moment tapped at the window, and the terrified Ro&s;alie remained im|moveable, with her eyes earne&s;tly fixed on the cur|tain, to ob&s;erve its movement, but all being &s;till &s;he mu&s;tered re&s;olution to approach it, and lifting the candle as high as &s;he could rai&s;e it at arms length, the &s;udden light di&s;turbed the intruder in the form of a large bat, which fluttered down, on the floor: This was &s;ome relief to her terror,
<PB N="139" REF="029134_0137_0FDFAE1AA2E58478">
and &s;he compa&s;&s;ionately gave him his liberty, and once more compo&s;ed her&s;elf and undre&s;&s;ed; but, alas! cro&s;&s;ing the room to extingui&s;h the candle &s;omething twitched the top of her hand, and with an involuntary &s;hriek, &s;he fell on the ground, and the wax taper being in her hand was &s;mothered and left her in total darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Her &s;hriek &s;oon echoed to Lady Mentoria's chamber, and the Dowager not being at yet in bed, though &s;he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her attendant, &s;lipped on a long robe de chambre and ha&s;tened to inquire the cau&s;e, and opening the door, all in white, with a &s;mall lamp in her hand, her grote&s;que head dre&s;s, had probably increa&s;ed the terror of Ro&s;a|lie, had &s;he not fallen on her face with both hands over her eyes, 'till the voice of Lady Mentoria rou&s;ed her &s;tupor, to whom &s;he related her fright, begging a thou&s;and pardons for the trouble &s;he had occa&s;ioned. Lady Mentoria &s;miling, tender|ly &s;oothed her agitation, "Make your&s;elf happy, little timorous girl," &s;aid &s;he, "Hervey &s;hall &s;leep with you; however let me convince you the imaginary &s;pectre that touched you was no other than the bell-ta&s;&s;el, which depends from the centre of the ceiling, and which you probably did not ob&s;erve or &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf within its reach, therefore re&s;t a&s;&s;ured there are no gho&s;ts haunt this Abbey that have not four legs at lea&s;t, and &s;hould they mole&s;t you, your good &s;en&s;e and innocence will

protect you 'till we can trace the tremendous in|truders."</P>
<P>Poor Ro&s;alie, aba&s;hed and angry at her weak|ne&s;s and expo&s;ition, entreated Lady Mentoria to retire, &s;aying &s;he was perfectly convinced of her folly, and would not trouble Mrs. Hervey to change her bed.</P>
<P>With this perfect a&s;&s;urance of courage the old Lady retired, and Ro&s;alie jumped into bed to re|flect on her ridiculous timidity, which &s;he deter|mined to conquer, and committing her&s;elf to the protection of the guardian angels, who hover around the pillow of innocence, &s;he reclined in the &s;weete&s;t &s;lumber, 'till a robin, perched on a branch that &s;haded her window, waked her with his Morning ori&s;on.</P>

<P>ROSALIE obeyed the &s;ummon of her plumaged monitor, and de&s;cended to the parlour ju&s;t in time to &s;ee Montague &s;et off home. For two hours &s;he amu&s;ed her&s;elf in the grounds, and &s;trolling to the end of a high terrace that bounded the Ab|bey, &s;he a&s;cended a flight of &s;teps that led to part of a rugged cliff, from whence on the pebbly &s;hore &s;he could di&s;cover the hovels of &s;everal fi&s;h|ermen, and their ruddy children dancing and a|mu&s;ing them&s;elves on the &s;ands, while their chear|ful voices chatting and laughing broke upon the &s;ilent breeze and wa&s;ted every &s;yllable to her ear.</P>
<P>A beautiful &s;erene ocean was bounded by a fer|tilized country on one &s;ide, and a noble &s;hore guarded by impending cliffs on the other. Here &s;he amu&s;ed her&s;elf half an hour and then return|ed
<PB N="142" REF="029134_0140_0FDFAE205B3E7108">
re&s;olving to &s;pend every lei&s;ure hour in this romantic and beautiful &s;pot, as a favourite re|treat from the glooms of the Abbey, when Lady Mentoria would indulge her with a &s;troll.</P>
<P>On entering the parlour Mrs. Hervey made her appearance, begging to know if &s;he cho&s;e to breakfa&s;t, as her Lady always took her cho|colate in her own room, which &s;he never quit|ted 'till twelve, therefore de&s;ired her young vi|&s;itor would amu&s;e her&s;elf as &s;he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie no &s;ooner fini&s;hed her dejune but &s;he went to the library, where &s;he entertained her|&s;elf for near three hours, 'till Lady Mentoria came in &s;earch of her.</P>
<P>"How is my &s;weet young friend? a&s;ked &s;he, peeping in with her para&s;ole and cloak, "Will &s;he take a walk?</P>
<P>"Gladly, Madam," an&s;wered Ro&s;alie, I &s;hall be happy to accompany you."</P>
<P>"I am going," returned the Dowager <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o vi|&s;it my pen&s;ioners; I have three po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hone&s;t fi&s;hers, who&s;e families I &s;upport, and by employ|ing them in procuring fi&s;h for my family, and others in the vicinity, I amu&s;e and keep them from the lethargy of indolence, and never ad|mitting

a &s;uperiority of preference, if one more envious quarrels with the other, I rectify their mi&s;takes, and my deci&s;ion is their law: Thus I pre&s;erve perfect tranquility, and I never &s;ee a cloud of &s;orrow or di&s;content &s;hade their brows; ever blithe and indu&s;trious, they may truly be &s;tiled happy cottagers&mdash;But you &s;hall judge.</P>
<P>Proceeding to the cliff where Ro&s;alie had taken her morning &s;eat, &s;he di&s;covered a winding path, guarded by &s;mall green rails, which Lady Men|toria <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d ordered to be cut through the cliff, in ea&s;y de&s;cent, expre&s;sly for the facility of her vi|&s;its, to &s;ave at lea&s;t two miles going round&punc; a bench at the bottom re&s;ted her again to re&s;pira|tion, and Ro&s;alie carried a ba&s;ket of currants for the children.</P>
<P>"It will plea&s;e the little creatures," &s;aid La|dy Mentoria, "and it will be a whole&s;ome treat for them; The&s;e my dear young friend, are the attentions I wi&s;h you to fulfil, when indi&s;po&s;ition o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> engagement prevents my attendance."</P>
<P>"A plea&s;ing employment, my dear Madam, I &s;hall willingly perform to the be&s;t of my abili|ties," replied Ro&s;alie.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="029134_0142_0FDFAE28E7EF7708">Three neat looking women and &s;even chubby children now welcomed their noble benefactre&s;s: One produced her &s;pinning, another her knitting, and the third con&s;tantly made and repaired the fi&s;hing nets; while their hu&s;bands at various hours when they were on &s;hore, were each fur|ni&s;hed with a loom, and wove~ dowla&s;s for their own wear, and the neighbouring villagers, to whom her Lady&s;hip permitted them to &s;ell any requi&s;ite quantity, by way of perqui&s;ite and en|couragement of their indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The boat &s;oon after arrived, and the fi&s;hers leaping on &s;hore pre&s;ented &s;ome beautiful prawns which were received with a benignant &s;mile of &s;a|tisfaction, and after making a few inquiries, and di&s;tributing the fruit among the children, (who&s;e &s;parkling eyes beamed expectation on the ba&s;ket's &s;tore) enjoined them to be good and dutiful, and &s;lipping a &s;hilling into each of their hands, told them it was the gift of the young lady they &s;aw with her, to whom they mu&s;t be re&s;pectfully obe|dient as to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Slowly they re-a&s;cended the cliff, often pau&s;ing to enjoy the healthy breezes of the ocean, and contemplate the re&s;tle&s;s wave da&s;hing its &s;tarry foam along the pebbly &s;hore, while at a di&s;tance the inflated white &s;ails of a pa&s;&s;ing ve&s;&s;el burni&s;h|ed by the meridian &s;un, glided on the bo&s;om of

the parted wave, and dazzled with its brightne&s;s the attentive eye that watched its le&s;&s;ening &s;ight &mdash;Ro&s;alie was charmed.</P>
<P>"As you love to contemplate the beauties of nature and innocence," &s;aid Lady Mentoria, "I &s;hall now lead you to an inland &s;cene; I have &s;e|ven cottages in the village which contain inhabi|tants of every de&s;cription, among them are the youthful and the aged: in one dwells a young in|du&s;trious couple ju&s;t married, in a &s;econd an aged pair, in a third a de&s;olated elderly widow, who in&s;tructs and protects two little orphans, in a fourth a couple in the autumn of life, &s;urround|ed by four charming children, who&s;e notability furni&s;hes and a&s;&s;i&s;ts their tender parents; in the fifth lives a venerable old warrior, and two &s;ons, &s;prightly, clever lads, now his only glory, though the field of honour has inve&s;ted him with many badges of valour, and though deprived of one leg, his crutches are in his opinion trophies he has never regretted to exchange; my &s;ixth cot|tage contains a poor blind man and one daughter, innocent, mild, and beautiful as the morn, the mo&s;t dutiful affectionate girl the fonde&s;t parent could delight in; while in my &s;eventh and la&s;t rural habitation lives a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed curate, with a la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wife and three children; to him I have al|lotted the con&s;tant and regular ob&s;ervance of morning and evening prayers, in every family,

and to in&s;truct them in reading and writing, of which he is capable, though the hand of oppre&s;&s;ion and misfortune has formerly cru&s;hed the talents that it &s;uffered to expand, had reverted honour to him&s;elf, and manife&s;ted improvement in others; thus his time is pretty well employed, and there is not a child in the village who does not delight to receive the mild and plea&s;ing in&s;tructions of Evelyn."</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing through a romantic picture&s;que lane, the rural irregular village pre&s;ented it&s;elf&mdash;Eve|lyn, who&s;e cottage was fir&s;t, &s;at reading at his door, and clo&s;ed his book to welcome the vi&s;itors; Catharine Evelyn was preparing the dinner; a fine baby lay in the cradle, rocked by a little girl about five years of age, while a healthy boy about two years older was &s;helling &s;ome beans.</P>
<P>"Patty's &s;ampler is almo&s;t fini&s;hed, my Lady," &s;aid the good Catherine, leaving the kneading of her dumplins, and pre&s;enting a &s;mall piece of can|va&s;s very prettily marked.</P>
<P>"Indu&s;trious little maid," &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, giving the ro&s;y Patty &s;ix-pence, which was con|&s;igned to the &s;ecurity of her mother's &s;crew-box, and the vi&s;itors unwilling to protract the dinner, took their leave.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="029134_0145_0FDFAE330E6228D0">The widow next pre&s;ented her little charges, whom &s;he was teaching to knit, and after com|mending and rewarding their indu&s;try, they pa&s;&s;|ed on to a third.</P>
<P>"This is Philip Stanley's cottage," &s;aid Lady Mentoria, "and the faithful Ellen, his new|made bride I &s;ee is bu&s;y at work, let us &s;tep in."</P>
<P>Ellen ro&s;e with a ba&s;ket of &s;tockings &s;he was repairing, and Lady Mentoria complimenting her jocularly on her improving looks, enquired for Philip, who was gone to cut turf and faggots, proceeded to the next, where they found Lennox, the old warrior, mending one of his crutches, and whi&s;tling, "God &s;ave the King.'</P>
<P>"Here is a news paper for you," &s;aid Lady Mentoria, "which I know is a great treat to you, but do not &s;uffer the feelings of &s;en&s;ibility to agitate you too far, remember you have been poorly, yet I don't forbid you to drop a tear of humanity for the woes of a fellow &s;oldier, as you read the &s;ad deva&s;tating fate of war.</P>
<P>Lennox bowed and con&s;igned it to his pocket, while his eloquent eye and &s;haking head &s;eemed to &s;ay he could enlarge on that &s;ubject if permitted.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="029134_0146_0FDFAE3517B6BD60">"Keep it to your&s;elf," &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, "and when you have peru&s;ed it give it to Eve|lyn."</P>
<P>The neighbouring cottage &s;heltered an aged pair, the poor old man crept feebly out to the door, with his &s;pectacles in one hand, and a let|ter in the other: "Your Lady&s;hip will excu&s;e the derangement of our cottage," &s;aid he, wiping a tear on his &s;leeve, "for we have ju&s;t received a letter from our dear boy Ben, who has been eight years in the Ea&s;t Indies, come next Chri&s;t|mas, and the good fellow &s;ends us the joyful news, he &s;hall be down here in le&s;s than a fortnight, and has brought home &s;omething to make our lives comfortable out of his earnings: Powers of mercy, we have been out of our wits with joy the&s;e three hours, and not a jot of work done for thinking on it, for we thought he might be dead, and never had a notion of &s;eeing him in this world again."</P>
<P>"Well, &s;aid Lady Mentoria, "don't flurry your&s;elf, I will provide a bed for him in your back room, let me know when he comes, &s;end him to the Abbey, his dutiful attention plea&s;es me."</P>
<P>The old man bowed, and Lady Mentoria con|tinued her walk.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="029134_0147_0FDFAE377AC3ABB0">At the door of another habitation &s;at two fine young girls &s;pinning, while a youth was bu&s;ily employed in pruning &s;ome plants in a little gar|den he had cultivated and brought to tolerable perfection; and a younger one was conning his le&s;&s;on for the next day. Lady Mentoria inquired a few particulars and pa&s;&s;ed on to the next.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know," &s;aid &s;he, "this cot con|tains my favourite pen&s;ioner, 'tis poor blind Or|ford, and the &s;weet Maria his only child, we &s;hall find them bu&s;y, no doubt."</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie tapped at the door, which was opened by the charming cottager, with her knitting and book in her hand; on one &s;ide a &s;mall table &s;at the venerable Orford, who hearing the voice of La|dy Mentoria laid down his work, and bowed his head.</P>
<P>"Always full of employment!" &s;aid her La|dy&s;hip, taking up &s;ome platted &s;traw his ingenui|ty had wove together, and formed into &s;mall mats and ba&s;kets.</P>
<P>"'Tis merely amu&s;ement," &s;aid Orford, "but la&s;t night I fini&s;hed a large ba&s;ket as a pre&s;ent for your Lady&s;hip, 'twill hold grapes or peaches, if you will honour me by accepting it from a poor blind man; Maria arranged the coloured &s;traw,

and &s;he tells me I have not made one mi&s;take; and our neighbours &s;ay 'tis very pretty."</P>
<P>Maria in&s;tantly brought it, and Ro&s;alie and Lady Mentoria wiped a tear as they admired and in&s;pected it.</P>
<P>"Make me two or three more, Orford, and I will give you half a crown a piece for your trou|ble."</P>
<P>"Oh! heavens ble&s;s my good lady, the honour of making them will be quite &s;ufficient, do I not con&s;tantly live on your bounty, and while I enjoy that ble&s;&s;ing God forbid I &s;hould be covetous; permit me then to make them only as a &s;mall but grateful return for the abundant favours you have heaped on me, and my heart in con&s;equence will feel lighter, by the idea of retaliating in &s;ome trifling mea&s;ure, the gratitude I owe you."</P>
<P>"Excellent man!" &s;aid Lady Mentoria, "plea&s;e your&s;elf, and fini&s;h them at your lei&s;ure: Maria's jacket wears fa&s;t, and I mean to give her a new one."</P>
<P>A flu&s;h of joy pa&s;&s;ed Maria's cheek, and &s;he poured her thanks. Lady Mentoria &s;oon after returned through the village with every one's ble&s;&s;ing wa&s;ted around her.</P>

<P>THREE days had elap&s;ed, and Ro&s;alie and Lady Mentoria were ju&s;t partaking a fine pine af|ter dinner, when the door opened, and Lord Ed|win limping in, &s;hook hands with his aunt, and bowed gracefully to Ro&s;alie.</P>
<P>"My dear Edwin," cried the a&s;toni&s;hed and confounded Lady Mentoria, "what can po&s;&s;ibly have brought you to the Abbey, is any accident the occa&s;ion of this unexpected vi&s;it?"</P>
<P>"A flight one," an&s;wered he. "My hor&s;e being re&s;tive, bru&s;hed too clo&s;e by the wheel of a waggon, and has brui&s;ed my leg, the pain of which encrea&s;ing, I thought it mo&s;t prudent
<PB N="155" REF="029134_0153_0FDFAE4B4AC27C70">
to make the be&s;t of my way to Thornley, and not endanger it by proceeding to the ca&s;tle; but had I known you was engaged with company, I &s;hould not have intruded."</P>
<P>"Oh, that young lady is only my companion, the ward of your father, an amiable orphan, Ed|win, who has been bred in an ob&s;cure part of Switzerland, Chamouny, I believe 'tis called: our di&s;po&s;itions &s;eem exactly to &s;uit, and I tru&s;t we &s;hall enjoy many happy years at the Abbey, oc|ca&s;ionally vi&s;iting my nieces at the Ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>Luckily for Ro&s;alie, Lady Mentoria had been too much engaged and flurried by the entrance of her nephew, to ob&s;erve the emotion that agitated the bo&s;om of her fair companion. Delighted to &s;ee him&mdash;fearful of di&s;covery&mdash;doubtful if he had really experienced the accident he complained of, and uncon&s;cious how to gain a moment's in|formation&mdash;a thou&s;and perplexities bani&s;hed and recalled the ro&s;e on her cheek, but very fortunate|ly to relieve her &s;u&s;pen&s;e Lady Mentoria begged he would make u&s;e of &s;ome embrocation, which &s;he retired to fetch from her private laboratory, and the intermediate moment of her ab&s;ence fur|ni&s;hed Ro&s;alie with a full explanation of the art|ful &s;tratagem he had u&s;ed to prevent &s;u&s;picion, by a&s;&s;uring her that he was perfectly free from acci|dent, and had flown on the wings of love to en|joy her &s;miles.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="029134_0154_0FDFAE4D6CD64D50">Lady Mentoria ju&s;t then entering with her em|brocation, ended the momentary conver&s;ation, and thankfully taking the bottle, he retired to bathe the imaginary contu&s;ion, and &s;oon after return|ed.</P>
<P>"'Tis &s;trange, &s;aid he as he entered, my boot &s;hould have given me &s;o much pain, and yet not the lea&s;t &s;ign of external injury is perceivable."

<P>In the cour&s;e of the evening Lord Edwin di&s;|tantly polite and &s;edate, introduced the topic of Italian.

<P>"Nay," replied her Lady&s;hip, "you are reck|oned to &s;peak it very fluent, why then talk of im|provement

<P>"Certainly not, why &s;hould I alarm him," an&s;wered he, "you know his timidity would cre|ate a hundred en&s;uing evils, a day or two will e|nable me to proceed, and he will ea&s;ily make an ex|cu&s;e for my detainment on the road, as travellers are never certain where curio&s;ity is the deity they &s;eek, and re&s;triction does not clip the wings of time in her pur&s;uance."</P>
<P>Every point of apparent propriety being thus &s;ettled, Edwin remained three days at the Abbey, and was then unable to plead longer excu&s;e, while Lady Mentoria, who watched with the mo&s;t rigid circum&s;pection the conduct of his Lord&s;hip, was perfectly &s;atisfied he entertained no other &s;en&s;ati|on for her fair charge than what his natural polit|ne&s;s and affability in&s;pired, and therefore ordering her low cabriolet, took her &s;eat by the &s;ide of Ro|&s;alie, and accompanied him part of the way for an airing.</P>
<P>Time had hobbled lamely with the Marquis, but when the long expected moment arrived, and Lord Edwin mentioned his delay at the Abbey, the Mar|quis's blood changed told; but recovering him&s;elf he enquired how his &s;i&s;ter was.</P>

<P>"I think her a plea&s;ing and intere&s;ting compa|nion," replied Lord Edwin, a&s;&s;umming all po&s;&s;ible &s;ang froid, "a brilliant, the &s;hades of ob&s;curity has not deprived of its lu&s;tre, and I don't doubt a little emulative poli&s;h will &s;oon render it a mo&s;t perfect and admirable acqui&s;ition to the envied po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or: She is a plea&s;ant Swi&s;s girl, charmingly liv|ly, yet mode&s;t and politely diffident, by what lit|tle I ob&s;erved, and I really think &s;he will be a ve|ry delightful companion for my aunt, if the gloomy Abbey does not in&s;til too much of the pen&s;oro&s;e, for 'tis a wretched dull place and would &s;oon give me the horrors."</P>
<P>"My aunt tells me &s;he is the daughter of &s;ome humble friend of yours, on who&s;e decea&s;e you was appointed guardian: Fortunate orphan! to have the protection of &s;o benevolent a man: Excu&s;e me, Sir, nor think me guilty of adulation, you have ever evinced your&s;elf the be&s;t of fathers, and my heart would be ungrateful not to acknowledge your worth."</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="029134_0157_0FDFAE589EA3DF40">"She is, alas! the child of misfortune in every &s;en&s;e," an&s;wered the Marquis, &s;ecretly rejoicing to have extracted the &s;entiments of his &s;on, "but I &s;hall take care of her with the anxious &s;olicitude of a parent, 'till I can marry her to &s;ome worthy and amiable man de&s;erving her affection, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d|ed by her inclination&punc; But don't you think her pretty?" added he, darting a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">trating look, if po&s;&s;ible to confu&s;e him.</P>
<P>"Humph, yes," an&s;wered the cautions Edwin, "tolerable; what can you expect in fact from a complexion expo&s;ed to the beams of the meridian, or the keen bla&s;ts of the mountainous climate, un|guarded by the &s;hades of art or fa&s;hion, to repel tho&s;e extremes &s;o pernicious to a delicate &s;kin; all the beauty Ro&s;alie can boa&s;t is the glow of health, that &s;he eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and nature has cer|tainly traced her pencil in the pure&s;t bloom to ani|mate her cheek, like the wild ro&s;e expo&s;ed to each inclement ray, &s;till boa&s;ting loveline&s;s and purity, while the rude wind that whi&s;tles round its head bends with &s;everity its feeble &s;tem, but cannot di|ve&s;t it of its charms: Yet I do not wi&s;h to call her hand&s;ome, her amiability of di&s;po&s;ition will &s;uffici|ently endear her to tho&s;e who&s;e generous and &s;eel|ing hearts participate her fate."</P>

<P>THE morning brought a number of friends to the Ca&s;tle, to congratulate Lord Edwin's return, and inquire how &s;oon he intended to &s;ail on his In|dian expedition, among&s;t them was the Duche&s;s of Albermarle, and her daughter Lady Cecilia Bou|verie, to whom the Marquis's partiality of genea|logy hoped to command the affection of Lord Ed|win, as his future bride.</P>
<P>She was too tall to be elegant, her countenance pallid and unintere&s;ting, her di&s;po&s;ition haughty,

and her partiality to the follies of dre&s;s extrava|gantly outre: yet to the&s;e imperfections was the Marquis totally blind; to unite the blazoned e&s;|cutcheon was his &s;ole wi&s;h, and, alas! the finer feelings of &s;en&s;ibility were eclip&s;ed by the dazzling allurement of grandeur, even founded on the ba&s;is of total di&s;regard; he thought the &s;acrifice of hap|pine&s;s amply &s;ub&s;tituted by the idolatry &s;uch &s;plen|dour would revert on his family from the antici|pated alliance; love had lo&s;t its potent charm in his bo&s;om, the flame was extinct that once blazed, with the &s;pirit of congeniality, and now the cor|roding worm of in&s;atiate ambition &s;upplied its place. Fatal tyrant! who&s;e uncontrolled power &s;ways every precept; love &s;hrinks from thy bane|ful influence, pity di&s;olves in tears at thy predomi|nance, while friend&s;hip half withdraws the extend|ed hand of unity, and &s;u&s;pects a lurking thorn concealed beneath the blooming yet fallacious ro&s;e of happine&s;s; and every virtue is impri&s;oned by this de&s;pot, in its deep rece&s;s: But for thy influ|ence the venerable Tankerville was the tendere&s;t parent, the mo&s;t faithful friend, and generous be|nefactor. His pillow was this night &s;trewn with the &s;harp thorns of &s;u&s;picion and vexation, which every remini&s;centia &s;erved but to augment, and his &s;leeple&s;s eyes were languid and heavy when he de&s;|&s;cended to breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="029134_0160_0FDFAE5E6859A2B8">After the repa&s;t was ended Lord Edwin was &s;ummoned to the library, and the Marquis deve|loped the burthen&s;ome &s;ecret that rankled in his bo&s;om, by declaring his &s;entiments in favour of Lady Cecilia, and earne&s;tly recommending &s;uch con&s;ideration to his &s;on.</P>
<P>Lord Edwin, unwilling to believe at fir&s;t, ral|lied the &s;ubject, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ilenced by a &s;tern look from the Marquis.</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear Sir," &s;aid he, re&s;pectfully ta|king his hand, "Edwin avows his real &s;entiments when he declares, Lady Cecilia boa&s;ts no charms to captivate his affection, love alone mu&s;t bind the fetter that retains his heart; yet, re&s;t a&s;&s;u|red, prudence, honour, and virtue &s;hall unite the ro&s;y links of his bondage, when inclination &s;olicits the &s;acrifice at the &s;hrine of fidelity, and parental affection &s;miles an approving con&s;ent; yet, I be&s;eech you never a&s;k me to be&s;tow that heart on Lady Cecilia, while its inmo&s;t feelings reject with painful anxiety its inability to retali|ate a mutual impre&s;&s;ion."</P>

<P>"Enough, enough," an&s;wered the enraged pa|rent, "&s;eal your lips on the &s;ubject, nor dare in|vade my ear with your high-flown phra&s;es more; yet remember, the hour you di&s;obey my wi&s;h, by uniting your&s;elf without my approbation, &s;hall di&s;inherit you from every po&s;&s;ible &s;ource of for|tune I can curtail: Retire and reflect on the ob|&s;tinacy of your refu&s;al, and when rea&s;on cools your heated imagination you may probably relent, and &s;tudy my happine&s;s as well as your own in|tere&s;t."</P>
<P>Lord Edwin con&s;cious of the &s;tability of &s;enti|ment he had ju&s;t profe&s;&s;ed, bowed and withdrew.</P>
<P>The Duche&s;s and Lady Cecilia were unfortu|nately invited to dinner, which was no &s;mall em|barra&s;&s;ment to Lord Edwin after the &s;ubject ju&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; the ceremony of dinner being ended without any particular occurrence, the Marquis propo&s;ed an evening ride, and as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Duche&s;s's landau had brought her to the Ca&s;tle, it was pro|po&s;ed to accommodate the Marquis, Lady Adela, and her&s;elf, white Lady Loui&s;a mounted Sir Hen|ry's phaeton, and the Marquis ordered his &s;on's curricle to convey him and Cecilia purpo&s;ely

<P>Lord Carlton's hor&s;e had not proceeded above two miles when taking fright at a water-mill it conquered the &s;kill of the rider and threw him. Lady Adela, who &s;aw the inevitable danger, &s;hrieked and fainted on the Duche&s;s's &s;houlder, and the whole cavalcade in&s;tantly &s;topped; the Duche&s;s's &s;alts were &s;ucce&s;sfully applied, and La|dy Adela revived amid&s;t the confu&s;ion of catch|ing the furious animal, who was now too mettle|&s;ome to mount, and at the earne&s;t de&s;ire of the Duche&s;s and lady Adela he agreed to take his &s;eat in the landau, though much wi&s;hing to continue his eque&s;trian exerci&s;e, but to calm the terror of the ladies who &s;o earne&s;tly entreated his forbear|ance, his polite conde&s;cen&s;ion obediently adopted their plan, and the vicious &s;teed was to be led by the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Lady Cecilia, who&s;e companion had probably not entertained her on the mo&s;t plea&s;ing or inter|e&s;ting &s;ubject, tired with his non-chalance, de|termined to mortify her&s;elf no longer, but put her re&s;olution of quitting her &s;eat in practice, and thereby convince her&s;elf of the reality or fal|lacy

<P>Lord Edwin &s;ecretly rejoicing at her riddance, in&s;tantly offered his hand to alight, a&s;&s;uring her, he was apprehen&s;ive of the animal's becoming ra|ther unruly.

<P>"Oh dear," replied &s;he, "I have &s;een none yet worthy of admiration, and Lord Edwin complains of the head-ach, which, of cour&s;e, rendered our go&s;&s;ip very in&s;ipid; I dete&s;t to hear of ennui, much more endure it, it vapours me to death in five minutes, therefore I thought it be&s;t not to increa&s;e it by my chat, &s;o we have not uttered more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mony &s;yllable each this half hour; I through compa&s;&s;ion to his brain, and he through inability of &s;ubject or inclination, and I never admire &s;tatuary you know," adding a &s;arca&s;tic laugh.</P>

<P>Not for the world," replied the voice of Lord Carlton at the carriage wheel, while Lady Adela glowed like crim&s;on.</P>

<P>A few days after a &s;evere touch of the gout at|tacked the venerable Dowager, who con&s;tantly at tho&s;e periods repaired to the Ca&s;tle, for the particular attendance of a favourite phy&s;ician, in con&s;equence of which they immediately &s;at out, travelling by &s;hort &s;tages 'till they reached the Ca&s;tle on the third evening.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Villars was that day or a vi&s;it to the la|dies, when the invalid arrived&punc; and Lord Edwin flying to the carriage, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Dowager to alight, while his countenance could &s;carce a&s;&s;ume the &s;emblance of &s;orrow due to the &s;ufferings of his aunt, as Ro&s;alie followed Lady Mentoria into the parlour, &s;upported between her nephew and Montague. Lord Edwin chair &s;tood vacant by the &s;ide of Mi&s;s Villars, but was in&s;tantly remo|ved to the oppo&s;ite one between the Dowager and Ro&s;alie.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Viliars's eyes were fixed on the tran&s;ient exchange, while Ro&s;alie had as intently ob&s;erved the &s;ituation of the vacated chair. "Upon my word you are an excellent nur&s;e, and indeed &s;hine
<PB N="179" REF="029134_0177_0FDFAE9386671960">
&s;uperior in that character to any other," &s;aid the imperious Amazon.</P>
<P>"I always was," replied Lord Edwin, "Lady Mentoria will vouch for me, I have frequently devoted my evenings to backgammon, for her amu&s;ement, while my &s;i&s;ters have joined &s;ome ju|venile party in the neighbourhood."</P>
<P>"A fine compliment to the belles and beaus," rejoined Mi&s;s Villars.</P>
<P>"A proof at lea&s;t of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he young man's humani|ty and conde&s;cen&s;ion to an old woman, neglected by the youthful part of her own &s;ex, afflicted with an infirmity heaven may in time retaliate on them."</P>
<P>"I hope I &s;hall never have the gout," an&s;wer|ed the haughty fair, "or at lea&s;t if I have, I hope my ill temper will never add to the trouble I &s;hall then be to every body."</P>
<P>"It mu&s;t undergo a thorough and &s;peedy re|form," replied the offended invalid, "for the impetuo&s;ity of youth will never be &s;oftened by the infirmities of age; it will tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bly augment peevi&s;hne&s;s, not dimini&s;h it, depend upon it, young lady."</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="029134_0178_0FDFAE9634A4BAF8">Ro&s;alie, hung tenderly over her chair, endea|voured by a thou&s;and little &s;tratagems to allevi|ate the pain, and divert her attention, while Mi&s;s Villars turning on her heel with half a &s;mile, a&s;ked Lord Edwin if he was too much occupied to take a &s;troll for the benefit of the air.</P>
<P>"Ah, do," cried Lady Mentoria, "and take Ro&s;alie with you, it will revive her after the confinement of a clo&s;e carriage." Lady Adela joined the reque&s;t, and Lord Edwin e&s;corted them.</P>
<P>Lady Mentoria now a&s;ked the Marquis if he had any objection to Ro&s;alie's remaining at the Ca&s;tle, or if he cho&s;e &s;he &s;hould return.</P>
<P>"No," replied he, "let her &s;tay, I think I have probed the heart of Edwin, and found no wound to penetrate, I am therefore ea&s;y on that &s;ubject."</P>
<P>The evening pa&s;&s;ed merrily away, and Ro&s;alie retired to a new apartment facing the portico of oranges, the evening was fair and clear, myriads of diamonds &s;tudded the azured veil of night, and fragrant odours embalmed the breeze, when &s;ome|thing lightly tapping at her window called her attention, and &s;he opened the &s;a&s;h, when a &s;mall note, fa&s;tened to a &s;tring, was thrown up and
<PB N="181" REF="029134_0179_0FDFAE97E4854610">
reached her hand; it was Lord Edwin, who&s;e billet earne&s;tly entreated &s;he would allow him half an hour's chat in the pavilion, by &s;even o'clock.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie nodded a&s;&s;ent, but &s;poke not, &s;hocked at his temerity, as Lady Mentoria's chamber join|ed her's, and he might have been di&s;covered, &s;he therefore clo&s;ed the blind and prudently with|drew.</P>

<P>THE Dowager recovered from her &s;light at|tack, and was per&s;uaded to pa&s;s a month at the Ca&s;tle, during which time Ro&s;alie improved ra|pidly in her drawing and mu&s;ic, and her &s;oft me|lodious voice was to give its fir&s;t &s;pecimen of de|light at a private concert, performed at the Ca&s;|tle; numerous friends and neighbours were invi|ted, and among the re&s;t the Honourable Frederic Waldegrave paid his fir&s;t vi&s;it &s;ince Ro&s;alie's ar|rival:
<PB N="182" REF="029134_0180_0FDFAE9A24894198">
Struck with the charms of her per&s;on, he lo&s;t his u&s;ual &s;prightline&s;s in the plea&s;ing contem|plation, and was her con&s;tant &s;hadow the whole evening, while Lord Edwin, who &s;ilently ob&s;erv|ed his motions, was deeply concerned and much agitated.</P>
<P>Lady Loui&s;a pre&s;ided at the grand piano forte, Lady Adela exqui&s;itely touched her harp, Lord Carlton performed on the violoncello, and Lord Edwin took his animating mellifluous flute, while Sir Henry flouri&s;hed the &s;prightly horn, and two &s;trangers &s;ubjoined their enlivening violins, Ro|&s;alie cho&s;e the fanta&s;tic tamborine, and two &s;ongs, with an inimitable charming compo&s;ition, adapt|ed for her favourite lute, con&s;tituted her &s;hare of the performance; &s;he was purpo&s;ely habited in the Savoyard &s;tile, and captivated every beholder; her beautiful &s;olo on the lute received unbounded applau&s;e, and when &s;he dropped it negligently by her &s;ide, Waldegrave in&s;tantly caught and appli|ed it to his lip.</P>
<P>"Do you play, &s;ir?" &s;aid the &s;weet girl.</P>
<P>"No," replied he, "I am only endeavoring, like the bee, to extract the honey from the little c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lls, becau&s;e tho&s;e charming lips have pre&s;&s;ed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">."</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="029134_0181_0FDFAE9E6B30DE98">Ro&s;alie unu&s;ed to adulation, felt her&s;elf at a lo&s;s to give a proper reply, and Lord Edwin coming towards them at the in&s;tant, happily relieved her embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>"Ro&s;alie," &s;aid he, lay by your magic lute, your next enchantment will be a &s;ong."</P>
<P>"What is it?" a&s;ked Waldegrave, touching the leaves of a ro&s;e placed on her bo&s;om, "The Man&s;ion of Peace?"</P>
<P>"No," an&s;wered Lord Edwin, perfectly un|der&s;tanding the que&s;tion, "that privilege is re|&s;erved for a cho&s;en few; the &s;ong &s;he favours us with is to aid the in&s;piration of Adela's harp, and will convince you 'tis not ill adapted to the &s;oul of the enchantre&s;s."</P>
<P>He then led her to the orche&s;tra, and whi&s;|pered her to beware of Waldegrave's freedom, which he did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at pre&s;ent dare re&s;ent. The a&s;&s;embly ob&s;erved a profound &s;ilence, and the beautiful Ro&s;alie and elegant Adela drew for|ward and began Mrs. Crouch's favorite &s;ong in the Heire&s;s; 'tis true, the warbler had often practi&s;ed it, but to night &s;he excelled every for|mer attempt: The benignity of her countenance, and the forcible expre&s;&s;ion laid on every line, captivated each attentive auditor, and a general
<PB N="184" REF="029134_0182_0FDFAEA1FB44CA60">
whi&s;per of prai&s;e buzzed in every part of the room.</P>
<P>Waldegrave rou&s;ed from his enchanting re|verie with a profound &s;igh, and again repeated his encomiums; the Marquis pa&s;&s;ing at the mo|ment pre&s;&s;ed her hand, "you are a good girl, and have plea&s;ed every body."</P>
<P>"She has enchanted them!" replied Walde|grave, "every body as if in&s;pired by magic, repeats but the name of this bewitching &s;yren."</P>
<P>The Marquis a&s;toni&s;hed at this rhap&s;ody, led him away, and the evening pa&s;&s;ed cheerfully on, but the &s;ucceding day brought Waldegrave to the Ca&s;tle, on &s;ome frivolous pretence, while Lord Edwin was airing, and Ro&s;alie was unfor|tunately alone in the pavilion, fini&s;hing a &s;mall drawing, while the ladies had retired to dre&s;s. Waldegrave delighted beyond expectation, &s;eiz|ed the happy moment to explain his raptures, offered her his hand and fortune, and a&s;&s;ured her of his unalterable attachment.</P>
<P>"Silence, Mr. Waldegrave," &s;aid &s;he, with|drawing her half-devoured hand, "you honour me too far, reflect for a moment to whom you are imparting your &s;entiments, bordering &s;urely on unguarded extravagance, I mu&s;t not, dare

not, believe them the deliberate effu&s;ions of &s;in|cerity, &s;urely they mu&s;t be the uncontrouled &s;ug|ge&s;tion of the moment, mere in&s;pirations of gal|lantry, yet however devoid of propriety, are, I tru&s;t, founded on the ba&s;is of honour."</P>
<P>"Perfectly &s;o, charming Ro&s;alie, nor time nor ab&s;ence &s;hall era&s;e the faithful fond impre&s;&s;ion, tell me then lovely angel, if Waldegrave's hopes may live in thy bewitching &s;mile; or doomed to meet thy frown, mu&s;t he re&s;ign that trea&s;ured heart to &s;ome more happy rival?"</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid Ro&s;alie, "I boa&s;t no heart to give, 'twas lo&s;t in the peaceful vale of Chamouny, 'ere I knew the&s;e plains."</P>
<P>Waldegrave turned pale, his lips trembled, his hand grew cold as he gra&s;ped hers:&mdash;"Ah! tell me then," &s;aid he, "who&s;e bo&s;om guards the ine&s;timable trea&s;ure, and I will fly to hear the tale, where if I find him, as perhaps I may, un|burthened with the gifts of fortune, my ample pur&s;e &s;hall well &s;upply the &s;ame deficiency, 'till it has rendered his more humble roof completely worthy of &s;o fair an inmate; then may I live to hear my Ro&s;alie is ble&s;t, and Waldegrave, wretch|ed Waldegrave, a&s;ks no farther recompen&s;e."</P>
<P>He now turned from her to hide the manly tear that flowed in &s;pite of every effort to retain
<PB N="186" REF="029134_0184_0FDFAEA613C97DA0">
it; and Ro&s;alie, &s;tung to the &s;oul, remained a perfect &s;tatue of a&s;toni&s;hment."</P>
<P>"Permit me to retire," &s;aid &s;he, in a low and tremulous voice, "unable from the overflow of gratitude to thank you as I ought, and incapable of expre&s;&s;ing what my lips would fain utter; yet, may every ble&s;&s;ing, every tranquil joy &s;urround you, and may the heart your fonde&s;t love &s;hall chu&s;e, return with equal rapture and &s;incerity thy matchle&s;s genero&s;ity and affection, while the poor humble Ro&s;alie &s;hall waft her pure&s;t prayer to heaven for your felicity&mdash;wretched boon I grant, but 'tis the &s;acred incen&s;e of a heart that would give more if love and honour did not hold it cap|tive."</P>
<P>"Generous girl!" an&s;wered the &s;till more en|raptured Waldegrave, "And mu&s;t I re&s;ign thee? Oh! cruel fate: Yet tell me, I be&s;eech you, the name of my rival, and I will cheri&s;h the envied robber with the affection of a brother, while he returns the fond care&s;&s;es of my Ro&s;alie, but if a &s;hade of &s;light, however tran&s;ient, cro&s;s the &s;un|&s;hine of thy happine&s;s, then Waldegrave's arm &s;hall plunge a dagger in the mon&s;ter's heart, and free the angelic &s;ufferer from his frown."</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie &s;huddered with horror, for his counte|nance during this energetic &s;peech had a&s;&s;umed every fury of real &s;en&s;ation. "We mu&s;t meet
<PB N="187" REF="029134_0185_0FDFAEAD45C9CFC0">
no more then," &s;aid &s;he, "you grow furious, a&s;k no further que&s;tions, I be&s;eech you, but leave me to my fate."</P>
<P>"Never, 'till you tell my rival's name and re&s;idence, that I may accompli&s;h my promi&s;e," rejoined Waldegrave.</P>
<P>"That I cannot reveal at pre&s;ent, I have co|gent rea&s;ons, but when time &s;hall develope my fate, the heart that claims the humble Ro&s;alie's, &s;hall generou&s;ly own, and &s;trive to imitate the ex|cellent virtues and gratitude of a Waldegrave; Adieu then, I mu&s;t fly to my chamber, or my length of ab&s;ence will create &s;u&s;picion."</P>
<P>"Adieu too lovely Ro&s;alie, a few days will convey me to the a&s;ylum of a faithful friend, who&s;e tender admonition will con&s;ole my wound|ed peace." Once more he ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and darting through the &s;hrubbery with the air of a maniac, mounted his hor&s;e, which he had fa&s;ten|ed to a tree at the entrance of the park, and re|tired un&s;een by any &s;oul.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie was transfixed to the gate over which &s;he had leaned, her eyes filled with tears, her hands cla&s;ped and rai&s;ed to heaven in &s;ilent ejacu|lation, when the &s;ound of Sir Henry Lan&s;downe's phaeton rou&s;ed her lethargic &s;tupor, and turning
<PB N="188" REF="029134_0186_0FDFAEAF2D0B3060">
quickly back into the hou&s;e &s;he entered her own apartment, where the mo&s;t painful reflections agi|tated her palpitating heart. "I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume du|plicity at the expence of di&s;cretion," &s;ighed &s;he, "for &s;hould the tale ever be revealed, what mi|&s;ery might it not entail on &s;uch a dreadful di&s;co|very to Lord Edwin! O, heaven avert it; al|ready he ob&s;erves the partial prai&s;es of Walde|grave with the keen eye of &s;u&s;picion, and &s;trictly repels them: Fatal &s;ecret! repo&s;e then in my bo|&s;om, where I will cautiou&s;ly guard thee, and all will yet be well."&mdash;</P>
<P>"All did I &s;ay? Alas! no&mdash;poor Waldegrave, where wilt thou find the balm to heal a wounded heart?

<P>Her eyes had lo&s;t their u&s;ual lu&s;tre, when &s;he de&s;cended to dinner, and Lord Edwin ob&s;erved it, but Ro&s;alie a&s;&s;uring him he was mi&s;taken, and a&s;&s;uming a gaiety of heart foreign to her feelings, it all pa&s;&s;ed off.</P>

<P>A FORTNIGHT elap&s;ed and Waldegrave had never appeared at the Ca&s;tle, when a morn|ing vi&s;it from Mi&s;s Villars, the Chronicle of the vicinity, proclaimed his departure.</P>
<P>"So Waldegrave has left his man&s;ion &s;udden|ly, on a trip to his friend Ellers, at Lime Park, and the beautiful eminence that overlooks Ro&s;e Vale is put in immediate de&s;ign, &s;everal work|men are employed, and as I pa&s;&s;ed, &s;eeing them very bu&s;y, I a&s;ked for what the &s;tructure was in|tended.

<P>From this charming amu&s;ement &s;he had one morning ju&s;t entered the hou&s;e, when Andrew met her in the hall. "A poor traveller is with|out, re&s;ting him&s;elf," &s;aid he "he &s;eems weak and feeble, &s;o I a&s;ked him into the hou&s;ekeeper's-room, but he refu&s;es, and is &s;itting near the great gate; he &s;eems more unhappy than hungry, I think, for I offered him &s;ome victuals, but he &s;hook his head and &s;aid he was only tired: He a&s;ked if the family were up, and I &s;aid no, only Mi&s;s Ro&s;alie."</P>
<P>"Poor fellow!" &s;aid the &s;ympathizing girl, "I will go and &s;ee if I can relieve him.'</P>
<P>In a few moments they reached the bench on which &s;at a per&s;on wrapped in an old &s;urtout and

and a flapped hat, an oak &s;tick re&s;ted his hands, on which leaned his head in the attitude of profound reverie, 'till the airy foot&s;tep of Ro&s;alie gently pattering on the gravel rou&s;ed him, and he rai&s;ed his head, but &s;poke not, for Andrew was clo&s;e be|hind gazing &s;tedfa&s;tly on him.</P>
<P>"Can I relieve you, friend?" cried the &s;oft voice of Ro&s;alie.</P>
<P>The traveller bowed, placed his hand on his bo&s;om, and pre&s;ented a &s;mall piece of paper, when Ro&s;alie unfolding it read the following words.</P>
<P>"Pardon and commi&s;erate the victim of de&s;pair, and allow five minutes conver&s;ation at the end of the &s;outh terrace to the wretched Waldegrave; govern your &s;urpri&s;e, impart a plau&s;ible relief, and follow the wanderer."</P>
<P>Twice did &s;he read it to recover her agitation, when taking out her pur&s;e to aid the di&s;&s;imulation, &s;he gave him a crown which he thankfully receiv|ed, and ri&s;ing took his immediate departure.</P>

<P>"It would not Indeed," &s;aid Ro&s;alie, "for he &s;eemed no common beggar, only a child of mi&s;e|ry, Andrew: but as I could not relieve his &s;or|rows more fully I did not wi&s;h to hear his mourn|ful tale."</P>
<P>"God give you his ble&s;&s;ing, for you are all charity and goodne&s;s, &s;weet angel lady," muttered An|drew, as &s;he tripped away to the terrace, where the di&s;gui&s;ed mendicant rai&s;ing his hat, di&s;covered the well known features of Waldegrave.</P>
<P>"Whence this cruel unguarded &s;urpri&s;e, Mr. Waldegrave?" a&s;ked the fair trembler, leaning over the parapet while he &s;eized her hand: "Beware," continued &s;he, "the temerity of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntru&s;ion, and be al&s;o expeditious in what you have to di&s;clo&s;e, that you may depart undi&s;covered before the family ri&s;e."</P>

<P>LORD EDWIN and Sir Henry being in Lon|don, Ro&s;alie was pen&s;ive, a thou&s;and painful ideas engro&s;&s;ed her mind. Lady Loui&s;a, in con&s;equence of her &s;wain's ab&s;ence, became dull, and her charm|ing &s;i&s;ter could only alleviate their ennui, by chatting and rambling with Lord Carlton, the only remaining beau, who&s;e engaging &s;en&s;ibility had &s;o far gained the Marquis's favour, that he had rea|dily, acceded to his wi&s;h, by permitting the in|crea&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion to cement between him and Lady Adela, and the next &s;pring was to confirm the happy union, as al&s;o the nuptials of Sir Henry and Lady Loui&s;a, an event anticipated by the Mar|quis with the greate&s;t delight, and his felicity had attained its &s;ummit, if Edwin too had accepted the hand of Lady Cecelia, but that was not to be, and a very different circum&s;tance was re&s;erved to prove the affection of the Marquis.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="029134_0201_0FDFAED257AF7A00">Several little parties had been formed to inte|re&s;t and amu&s;e the lingering hours, when Frederic Waldegrave arrived at the Ca&s;tle, and invited the family to partake of a farewell dinner at the Manor, which was readily accepted by the Marquis, who earne&s;tly enquired his motives for leaving England.</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h," &s;aid he, "Edwin would accompany you, but he is &s;o bigotted to his Pari&s;ian friend, that becau&s;e he declines going this year, no per|&s;ua&s;ion can induce him to make the trip."</P>
<P>"And probably I &s;hall not &s;tay long in the We&s;t," replied Waldegrave, "therefore I &s;hould only lead him a&s;tray, for I &s;hall be a wanderer at large, where fancy or inclination directs."</P>
<P>Such a negligent reply &s;ilenced the Marquis's inquiry, and Thur&s;day was the appointed day for the vi&s;it to the Manor, Ro&s;alie dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf as plain as po&s;&s;ible, though &s;he was convinced Mi&s;s Villars and every belle in the vicinity would en|deavour to out-rival each other.</P>
<P>At four the company a&s;&s;embled, and were enter|tained with an elegant dinner, fe&s;tivity and hilar|ity prevailed without alloy, and the evening being very inviting, the Marquis propo&s;ed &s;ailing on a fine canal, that ran through the exten&s;ive plea|&s;ure grounds; the &s;ailing-boat was ordered out, and the party took their &s;eats.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="029134_0202_0FDFAED411A6F778">After an hour &s;pent in the mo&s;t agreeable man|ner, a threatening cloud pre&s;aged a violent &s;torm, which &s;oon veiled the atmo&s;phere. Ro&s;alie terri|fied, &s;unk on the &s;houlder of Waldegrave, and the company landed as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and made the be&s;t of their way to the hou&s;e, but as Walde|grave &s;upported the trembling Ro&s;alie, a vivid fla&s;h cro&s;&s;ed the path, and again &s;he &s;unk on his arm: Each gentleman fully employed with their re&s;pective charges, ha&s;tened on, all equally fright|ened, and &s;aw not the relap&s;e of Ro&s;alie, who hap|pened to bring up the rear, and Waldegrave, re|collecting the hermitage to be but a few paces di&s;|tant, bore her thither, and as it was probable the &s;torm would encrea&s;e, had endeavoured to prevail on the re&s;t to take &s;helter in its rece&s;s&mdash;but in vain, as they thought be&s;t to retreat before the &s;hower fell to prevent their flight, as they were at lea&s;t a quarter of a mile di&s;tant from the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Waldegrave now carried his lovely burthen to the &s;olitary &s;tructure, &s;o lately completed, laid her on a couch, and flew to get &s;ome water, when &s;up|porting her head to rai&s;e it on his arm, a &s;mall pearl cro&s;s, confined by a ribbon, di&s;covered it&s;elf on her bo&s;om; in&s;tantly Waldegrave &s;lipped the &s;tring, and, purloining the trea&s;ure, &s;ecreted it in his own bo&s;om, as the only memorial of her he &s;hould be able to obtain, in&s;tinctively he pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="205" REF="029134_0203_0FDFAED66E2FB330">
it to his lips, and then con&s;igned it to its future repo&s;itory.</P>
<P>Scarce had he recovered the agitation of his &s;e|cretion when Ro&s;alie opened her eyes, and wildly enquiring where &s;he was, expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t terror at her &s;ituation.&mdash;The hermitage grew dark, the &s;torm increa&s;ed, and Waldegrave &s;ooth|ed her fears by every tender a&s;&s;iduity; But equally alarmed at being alone, and &s;ubject to his ad|dre&s;&s;es, &s;he earne&s;tly entreated to brave the &s;torm and venture on.</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" cried he, it pours in torrents, patience, lovely Ro&s;alie, you are perfectly &s;afe; we &s;hall &s;oon be mi&s;&s;ed, and the &s;ervants will be &s;ent to accommodate you with &s;helter of &s;ome kind, I cannot leave you alone or I would fly thither; be compo&s;ed, I think I &s;ee &s;omebody coming through the vi&s;ta, but the fla&s;hes are &s;o vivid I cannot di&s;cern who it is."</P>
<P>A few moments brought Thomas and Gregory, With the family &s;edan, and a coat and umbrella for their ma&s;ter; for the company terrified at their ab&s;ence, were fearful &s;ome accident had happened, and the fury of the tempe&s;t prevented any but the &s;ervants from coming to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Waldegrave in&s;tantly placed her in the chair, and walked &s;lowly by her &s;ide to pacify her fears; at

<P>THE Marquis now left him and returned to the parlour, where h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ated as briefly as po&s;&s;i|ble the whole occurrence. Lord Edwin was all agitation: Ro&s;alie, di&s;&s;olved in tears, and would have flown to her parent's apartment while the lovely &s;i&s;ters &s;weetly &s;oothed her woe, and breathed the &s;igh of pity to the &s;ad, &s;ad tale.</P>
<P>Lady Mentoria, who doated on her unhappy niece, felt the unexpected &s;troke of mi&s;ery mo&s;t poig|nant: "Lovely &s;ufferer," exclaimed &s;he, as &s;he peru&s;ed the explanatory letters of Lavinia, which the Marquis had con&s;igned to her care, previous to delivering them to Wal&s;ingham, and though &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the firme&s;t principle of humanity and commi&s;eration for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, a har&s;h invective at fir&s;t e&s;caped her lip, as &s;he condemned the fero|city of Wal&s;ingham.</P>
<P>On the following morning Ro&s;alie followed the Marquis to the chamber of the invalid, who&s;e
<PB N="227" REF="029134_0225_0FDFAF1EA6678B00">
impatience would not be pacified from embracing his child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> although the &s;urgeon pronounced any irritation would encrea&s;e his fever, and protract the effect his aid tended to produce.</P>
<P>He was ju&s;t ri&s;en when the lovely girl, &s;carce able to conceal her joy, entered his chamber, and flying to embrace him, &s;unk on her knees; a copi|ous torrent of tears luckily relieved the full bo|&s;ome of Wal&s;ingham, as he tenderly rai&s;ed and em|braced her.</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid he, "is it thus I fold to my heart the angelic image of a dearer &s;elf? Here let me trace the blu&s;hing beauties of my &s;weet Lavinia, thou &s;ole ble&s;t gift of Heaven:&mdash;Oh! her expre&s;|&s;ive eye &s;till beams in thine, her dimpled &s;mile yet lingers on thy ro&s;y cheek, and thy &s;oft dulcet voice recals her animating tone.

<P>Ro&s;alie cla&s;ped his hand, in &s;ilent agony, and pre&s;&s;ed it to her bo&s;om, "I will be all obedience, all affection, deare&s;t Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "and may you long live to trace in me the virtues of my ho|noured

<P>"Talk not of injured innocence," cried he "for, alas! that conviction would unman a &s;toic, much more a wretch like me."</P>
<P>The &s;cene grew too affecting, and the Marquis begging Ro&s;alie to retire, &s;oon after left him.</P>
<P>Three days elap&s;ed, during which time Wal&s;ing|ham was confined to his bed, in con&s;equence of his irritation of mind having heightened the fever, and Ro&s;alie attended him with the mo&s;t af|fectionate care: he had al&s;o &s;olicited the letters the Marquis had promi&s;ed him, the effect of which &s;o agitated him, he was obliged frequently to lay them a&s;ide, at the reque&s;t of the tender Ro&s;alie&punc; who&s;e tears flowed with equal poignancy as his own, and almo&s;t overpowered her drooping &s;pirits:</P>
<P>One page in particular, read by Ro&s;alie, who&s;e voice could &s;carce articulate, almo&s;t drove him frantic; 'twas a full confe&s;&s;ion from Lady La|vinia, recounting the rea&s;on of her meeting the Chevalier that fatal evening which terminated his exi&s;tence and her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Morency it &s;eems, had u&s;ed every &s;eductive and adulative argument to induce her to elope, &s;uppo|&s;ing

Lavinia, terrified for the &s;afety of her hu&s;band, conjured him to bani&s;h the idea of revenge, and on pain of her eternal di&s;plea&s;ure ever to reveal, or cau&s;e Wal&s;ingham to &s;u&s;pect his partiality, thinking&punc; by this means to avoid the dreaded encounter of an innocent, yet offended hu&s;band, and a furious and re&s;olute lover, whom in reality her &s;oul abhorred; but her placid amiable di&s;po&s;ition, ever void of offence, &s;trove if po&s;&s;ible by gentle entreaty to prevail on Morency, while her terror depicting every calamity from &s;o fatal a determination, had, in order to conceal it under the &s;olemn threat &s;he had made, met him on the terrace that evening, to extort the performance of his promi&s;e, and by that means in&s;ure the &s;afety of her ever valued love, and what diabolical fiend could have di&s;co|vered the a&s;&s;ignation, known only to them&s;elves, was a my&s;tery her utmo&s;t vigilance could never develope.</P>
<P>This proof of affection &s;tung Wal&s;ingham to the &s;oul. "Is this the dreadful truth?" cried he, "Fatal victim of credulity: Alas: how the fren|zy of jealou&s;y veiled my &s;en&s;es: Yes, I heard her repeat every &s;yllable this letter avows, but deaf to rea&s;on or a moment's reflection, I con|&s;trued

every &s;entence in the mo&s;t different light, and can only recompen&s;e her wrongs by promot|ing the happine&s;s of my child, which &s;hall be the &s;tudy of my exi&s;tence."</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie now laid a&s;ide the papers, and Wal&s;ing|ham giving her the key of his portmanteau, beg|ged her to take out his pocket book for &s;omething he wi&s;hed to find, and turning over &s;everal letters a &s;mall piece of paper fell to the ground, which Ro&s;alie picking up pre&s;ented to her father. "I do not recollect what it can be," &s;aid he, "open it, my love&punc;" Ro&s;alie obeyed, but it in&s;tantly fell from her hand and &s;he turned pale. "Oh, 'tis the pearl cro&s;s," &s;aid Wal&s;ingham, "the ami|able Waldegrave's legacy: But ob&s;erving the agi|tation of his child, (who &s;tood almo&s;t petrified, ga|zing alternately on him and then on the bauble) he caught her hand, and inquired the cau&s;e of her a&s;toni&s;hment.

a few days terminated his exi&s;tence: I mu&s;t own I was particularly &s;truck with his figure and affa|ble deportment, and never left his bed 'till he ex|pired; a few minutes before which he took from his bo&s;om this cro&s;s, pre&s;&s;ed it to his lip, and beg|ed me ever to keep it as the &s;acred relic of a faith|ful but unhappy lover.</P>
<P>"My &s;tory," &s;aid he, "like my&s;elf, will be con&s;igned to oblivion, nor &s;hall I reveal the name of the angel from who&s;e bo&s;om I purloined this trea&s;ure, as it is very improbable you &s;hould ever behold her, yet &s;hould chance &s;o ordain it, &s;he will in&s;tantly recogni&s;e it when you repeat the haple&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it was Frederic Waldegrave."</P>

<P>Ro&s;alie obeyed, and repeated every minute cir|cum&s;tance, much to the &s;atisfaction of Wal&s;ing|ham, who was delighted with her prudence, while &s;weetly blu&s;hing, &s;he faintly acknowledged the prevalent partiality of Lord Edwin.</P>

<P>ON the day following he was permitted by his &s;urgeon to leave his room, and take his &s;eat at the family table, where the glances of melancholy of|ten obtruded for it had occa&s;ioned great inquiry and &s;urpri&s;e among&s;t the hou&s;ehold, although the affair had been &s;mothered as much as po&s;&s;ible, yet as Ro&s;alie had ever been declared an orphan, it was nece&s;&s;ary to report the decea&s;e of her father had been a fabrication, and he was now re&s;tored by an unfore&s;een event, when in pur&s;uit of his family and friends: Such was the prevalent &s;tory, and curio&s;ity was tolerably &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Marquis now began to perceive with re|gret, the partiality of his &s;on, and taking him one day into his &s;tudy, reprimanded his terror, on Ro&s;alie's being &s;tung by a hornet, as it plainly di&s;|covered an unu&s;ual degree of alarm and attention in the agitation of his anxious countenance, when Lord Edwin, unable to conceal his &s;entiments, confe&s;&s;ed his interviews at Chamouny, and &s;olici|ted,

with the unfeigned tear of earne&s;t love, his ble&s;&s;ing and con&s;ent to an union of heart and &s;entiment Heaven only could di&s;&s;olve.</P>
<P>"Is it thus, Edwin, your duplicity has exult|ed?" a&s;ked the Marquis &s;ternly, glancing a look of ferocity on his &s;on; "And has the fallacious &s;nake I fo&s;tered in my bo&s;om thus planned its grateful retaliation, by leaving its &s;ting in the rece&s;s that protected it? Ah!

<P>Lord Edwin pau&s;ed, fearful of irritating the Marquis, who &s;eemed to be impatiently waiting his reply, and therefore &s;ummoning courage, and couching his &s;entiments in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive form, he thus replied.</P>
<P>"If you require me to expre&s;s the real effu&s;ions of the &s;incerity I feel," an&s;wered he, "the virtu|ous &s;oul, graceful amiability, and unfeigned gra|titude, I di&s;covered in the lovely girl, had &s;urely made me forget the properties of nobility, and in her cottage the &s;plendour of high life had, in compari&s;on, excited my pity and di&s;gu&s;t, for I could there trace &s;uch intere&s;ting &s;cenes of nature in her boundle&s;s luxuriance, as would have ex|panded your heart with every &s;ublime in&s;piration it did mine. Chamouny was then to me a Para|di&s;e, and Ro&s;alie the benignant angel to guide and explain the my&s;terious powers of creation, that

<P>Edwin bowed and was opening the door, as Ro|&s;alie gently tapped, unknowing the Marquis was in conver&s;ation, much le&s;s conceiving &s;he was the &s;ubject of the tete-a-tete.</P>
<P>"I hope I don't intrude," &s;aid the lovely girl, the expre&s;s picture of beautiful innocence, with a &s;mall ba&s;ket of ro&s;es, "Permit me to reque&s;t your acceptance of this charming ro&s;e, for I know it is your favourite flower as well as mine: I have ju&s;t gathered a few, and am come to place it in your bo&s;om as &s;oon as I have dive&s;ted it of its thorns," and &s;eating her&s;elf on a dutche&s;s by the &s;ide o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Marquis, took out her &s;ci&s;&s;ars to clip them off.</P>

<P>Ro&s;alie's hat &s;hading her eyes as &s;he was bu&s;ily employed, had concealed the reciprocal glance that had been exchanged, and &s;he wondered at the Marquis's unu&s;ually-cool reception. "Why &s;o &s;ilent, dear Sir?" a&s;ked &s;he, mode&s;tly placing the ro&s;e in his bo&s;om, and making a &s;miling court&s;ey.</P>
<P>May you, Ro&s;alie, be ever as careful of plant|ing a thorn in my bo&s;om as you have been to guard me from the wound of the&s;e; but retire, my love, I am engaged with my writing, and can|not be interrupted; take charge of your pre&s;ent again, and pre&s;erve it till we meet at dinner, when I &s;hall be more at lei&s;ure to admire it, and thank the attentive donor.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alie &s;ealed the pardon of her intru&s;ion by ki&s;&s;ing his hand, and wi&s;hing him good morning, left him to his private meditations.</P>

<P>Such were her reflections, when her father pa&s;s|ing through the anti-chamber, di&s;turbed her.</P>
<P>"Ro&s;alie," &s;aid he, "I have ju&s;t received let|ters from London, in an&s;wer to tho&s;e I wrote three days &s;ince, and am &s;orry to &s;ay, I have very unplea&s;ing accounts of a con&s;iderable debt, by the failure of a capital merchant, and mu&s;t in con&s;equence &s;et off to-morrow for the Metropolis, if the Marquis is in his &s;tudy I mu&s;t &s;peak with him, as the merchant is a friend of his, and he in con&s;equence, can advi&s;e me what mea&s;ure is mo&s;t expedient to adopt."</P>

<P>By eleven the elegant group had a&s;&s;embled in the drawing-room, the blu&s;hing brides wore each a dre&s;s exactly &s;imilar, a plain mu&s;lin robe loo&s;ely fa&s;tened over white &s;ar&s;enet, and long veils negli|gently thrown over their beautiful ringlets, un|&s;ullied by powder, quite in morning di&s;habille by the Marquis's de&s;ire, who arranged the proce&s;&s;ion to the chapel in the following order: Lord Edwin and Ro&s;alie led the way, Lord Carlton and Lady Adela followed, and Sir Henry and Lady Loui&s;a preced|ed the three bride-maids, and their re&s;pective beaus, while the Marquis and Lady Mentoria, with the Count and Counte&s;s brought up the rear, and the attendants clo&s;ed the proce&s;&s;ion: The avenues of the park were lined with villagers, and the cha|pel doors were thrown open to admit a view of the ceremony; on the altar was &s;pread a cover|ing of white &s;attin, edged with &s;ilver fringe, while

three chalices of gold contained the mo&s;t beauti|ful exotics, and from the centre one blazed aro|matic incen&s;e, and a wreath and branches of ro&s;es intermixed with myrtle, richly waved in impend|ing fe&s;toons round the table, and formed a mo&s;t beautiful appearance, while it delighted the &s;pec|tator, for Andrew alone had invented and arrang|ed the charming decoration, to plea&s;e and &s;urpri&s;e the party; three &s;tools, covered with the &s;ame fringed &s;attin &s;upported the adorative knee of each blooming bride; and returning to the Ca&s;tle, Andrew had again evinced his ingenuity by &s;trew|ing the avenue with blo&s;&s;oms.</P>
<P>This mark of attention plea&s;ed the Marquis, "Thou &s;halt not go unrewarded, Andrew," &s;aid he, as the grateful old man gently wiped a tear of heart-felt &s;atisfaction on his clea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;potted &s;ilk handkerchief, drawn from its long-hoarded re|ce&s;s on the pre&s;ent joyful occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The brides &s;oon after retired to dre&s;s for din|ner. Ro&s;alie's robe was of white crape, &s;pangled with &s;ilver, and the train looped with pearls, and encircled by wreaths of yellow ro&s;es cro&s;&s;ing the petticoat, fa&s;tened by &s;ilver cordage and ta&s;&s;els of bullion. Lady Adela's dre&s;s differed only in the flowers; wreaths of convolvulus fe&s;tooned her pet|ticoat, and a drapery &s;a&s;h of violet &s;attin cro&s;&s;ed the train, depending from the &s;houlder and fa&s;t|ened in negligent elegance on the left &s;ide: While
<PB N="257" REF="029134_0255_0FDFAF78D7083D80">
Lady Loui&s;a's fancy &s;elected the pomegranate blo&s;|&s;om to adorn an exact &s;imiliar robe, and turbans of the &s;ame texture, with elegant plumes of o&s;trich and paradi&s;e feathers, ornamented and con&s;tituted their head dre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Lady Mentoria, before the charming brides left their dre&s;&s;ing-room exhibited her genero&s;ity, by pre&s;enting a ca&s;e of jewels, from which &s;he di&s;|tributed elegant memorials of her affection; to Lady Adela &s;he a&s;&s;igned a &s;uperb diamond cre&s;cent for her turban; to Lady Loui&s;a a diamond plume; and to her charming Ro&s;alie a brilliant bandeau of exqui&s;ite beauty for her hair, while the genero|&s;ity of her father had al&s;o exemplified it&s;elf in the choice of an elegant pair of ear-rings and necklace, of beautiful pearls, with an enamelled watch &s;et with the &s;ame, and Lord Edwin fa&s;tened his own incomparable miniature, &s;et with brilliants, round the bo&s;om of his lovely bride, when &s;he de&s;cend|ed in full blaze of beauty to the drawing-room.</P>
<P>The bridegrooms were elegantly dre&s;&s;ed in em|broidered &s;uits, but Lord Edwin's expre&s;&s;ive and charming countenance added to his graceful form, rendered him the mo&s;t captivating object of admi|ration, nor had hone&s;t Andrew erroneou&s;ly ad|judged the prize of beauty to Ro&s;alie, who, in|deed, far eclip&s;ed the rival &s;i&s;ters, and was un|commonly

cheerful and enchanting the whole day, which has pa&s;&s;ed in the highe&s;t fe&s;tivity, and a &s;umptuous entertainment given to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erous and brilliant company, nor were the villagers exempt from &s;haring the general bounty, as an ample and excellent dinner was provided them on the back lawn.</P>
<P>Lady Mentoria's pen&s;ioners too, though &s;ixty miles di&s;tant, had not been forgotten, and the &s;ame fe&s;tivity reigned in their tranquil village on the occa&s;ion, while their evening concluded with dan|cing, bonfires, and a ru&s;tic epithalamium, com|po&s;ed by Evelyn, and chanted by every villager, while tho&s;e who could not &s;ing, readily and ear|ne&s;tly repeated it.</P>
<P>A private ball in the evening at the Ca&s;tle which broke up at twelve, compleated the entertain|ment, when the Count and Counte&s;s of Valletort, with Lord and Lady Carlton, and the Ladies Fitz|roy, retired to Carlton Villa, about five miles di&s;|tant: Sir Henry and Lady Lan&s;downe to their &s;eat al&s;o in the &s;ame vicinity, accompanied by two of Sir Henry's intimate friends: and Lord Edwin and Lady St. Laurens, with their elegant bride-maid, Lady Selina Courtney, remained at the Ca&s;tle where they continued about three weeks, when they &s;et off for their town re&s;idence in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, and the delighted parent undertook his voyage to India about a month afterwards.</P>

<P>"You have &s;urely, my Lord," added Monta|gue, "&s;aved the poor drooping creature from the brink of de&s;truction."</P>
<P>"Thy beneficent heart at lea&s;t is willing to hope &s;o," replied the Marquis, "What good may re|&s;ult from my plan heaven knows, but I tru&s;t I have removed her from iniquity, and prevented her ever doing more mi&s;chief in England, how|ever her propen&s;ities may be renewed in a foreign clime."</P>

to prove the &s;park of grateful affection had not been extingui&s;hed on the altar of munificence, and that memory would &s;till proportion the reward of merit: The letter was, as u&s;ual, fraught with every &s;entiment of affection and re&s;pect, and communicated the news of Madelon and Lindor's intended nuptials in a few weeks, from the time it left Chamouny; it al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed Giraldine grew infirm, and Reuben was &s;ubject to a fixed rheumatic, &s;o that Jo&s;ephine now de&s;paired of ever vi&s;iting England, as attendant to her valu|ed friend, for the marriage of Madelon would to|tally confine her as nur&s;e and manager of the cot|tage and it would remain for her alone to &s;mooth the pillow of infirmity, and &s;upport the crutch of decr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pitude.

<P>Lady St. Laurens read the letter with delight, and in&s;tantly penned one in return, expre&s;&s;ing her plea&s;ure at the news of Madelon's happine&s;s, and de&s;iring her to fix on the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and com|modious vacant cottage, which &s;he reque&s;ted might be furni&s;hed with every requi&s;ite conveni|ence, to defray which expence &s;he inclo&s;ed a bank note, and a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent for Jo&s;ephine, whom &s;he enjoined to be virtuous and dutiful, and added, &s;he &s;hould ever con&s;ider Reuben and Giral|dine her pen&s;ioners, for who&s;e &s;upport &s;he &s;hould faithfully tran&s;mit twenty pounds per annum, as
