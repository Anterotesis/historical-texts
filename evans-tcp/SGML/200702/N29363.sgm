<HEAD>The Curate of Elmwood. A TALE,</HEAD>
<P>IF thou art a Curate, O reader, and ha&s;t already <HI>one</HI> pari&s;h in thy po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, be contented, and &s;eek not to have <HI>two.</HI> Be a&s;&s;ured that content|ment is better than to have <HI>two liv|ings.</HI></P>
<P>Many good people be&s;ides Shake|&s;peare, have been born upon the Av|on; and one of them was the Curate of the Pari&s;h of Elmwood, Of a family of nine people, parents and children, only he and his daughter JULIA remained.</P>
<P>The old par&s;on could do many things be&s;ides eating his pudding, drink his October, and collect his tithes;&mdash;important qualifications, which have been, from time immemorial, annexed to the office of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">te.&mdash; He carried the &s;ciences in his head,
<PB N="6" REF="039105_0005_10139C51466F6278">
and morality in his heart; I mean, &s;o far as they are connected with man|ners or &s;entiment&mdash;added to this, he preached an excellent &s;ermon, wore his own grey hairs, and had the gout; but above all, he loved, mo&s;t dearly loved, his beautiful daughter JULIA.</P>
<P>And well did &s;he de&s;erve his love. &mdash;Sweet Maid! if ever I forget thee, may my fancy lo&s;e her flights, and my pen its movements; if ever I for|get the maje&s;tic elegance of thy form &mdash;or the liquid blue &s;wimming in thy eye&mdash;or the half ro&s;e, half-lily colours glowing on thy cheek, like the &s;treaks of the we&s;t in a July eve|ning.&mdash;</P>
<P>Her per&s;on had all tho&s;e unde&s;crib|able points of divine beauty, which the pure imagination a&s;cribes to an|gels&mdash;her mind was fa&s;hioned by the &s;ciences&mdash;her di&s;po&s;ition by charity, and her &s;entiment by truth.</P>
<P>The man&s;ion of the&s;e contented re|latives ro&s;e in the centre of the par|i&s;h&mdash;it was neither &s;tately nor proud &mdash;like its inhabitants, it was mode&s;t,

and &s;eemed to retire into an ob&s;cure and &s;ilent glade, formed between va|rious clumps of &s;hrubbery, and a ridge of ri&s;ing ground. At a &s;mall di&s;tance rolled the &s;ilver Avon, ever mu&s;ical, now mantling over a rocky channel, and now gliding through plains and fields covered with wild flowers.</P>
<P>Through the&s;e fields, and along the&s;e &s;kirted banks, full oft did the Curate and his daughter pur&s;ue their walk&mdash;in that &s;weet hour of the eve|ning, when the &s;un &s;eems dropping behind the hills, and throws a feeble but plea&s;ing beam over the land&s;cape; then might you &s;ee them wander, arm in arm, and &s;lowly on the Avon|&s;ide. "JULIA (he would &s;ay to his daughter) my dear JULIA, you and my pari&s;h are the comforts of my life. Ye are all my children&mdash;but you, JU|LIA, you are my friend&mdash;the thir&s;ty loves not to drink, nor the weary to re&s;t, more than I love to look upon <HI>you</HI>&mdash;what would become of me, JU|LIA,
<PB N="8" REF="039105_0007_10139C569215F970">
wert thou gone? And when I am gone, my daughter, what will be|come of thee?"&mdash;"I hope, father, we &s;hall die both together."&mdash;"God grant it! God grant it!" an&s;wered the good old man.</P>
<P>Thus peaceably glided on their lives, till an unlucky accident in the neigh|bouring pari&s;h di&s;turbed their tran|quility. The vicar of that pari&s;h di|ed.&mdash;The moment our Curate was informed of this, it rou&s;ed one of his wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ions: he had now but one wi&s;h to be gratified in this world; and that was, to have the neighbour|ing vicarage in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. "My dear father (&s;aid the unambitious JULIA) have we not competence; and does not competence afford us felicity? and is not this &s;ufficient?"&mdash;Aye, all that was very true: but then the vi|carage lay &s;o &s;nug&mdash;ju&s;t at his own door; and he wanted to have it in his power to leave &s;omething to his JULIA after his death.</P>
<P>But much remained yet to be done. The Curate had talked like a man un|acquainted
<PB N="9" REF="039105_0008_10139C58187B3258">
with calculations, and his fancy (old as it was) got the &s;tart of his judgment. He did not con&s;ider that Lord C&mdash; the patron of the living, re&s;ided at London, and that his own limbs were too gouty to car|ry him thither&mdash;for per&s;onal applica|tion is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the&s;e ca&s;es: be&s;ides, the clergy, though they are continually advi&s;ing their flocks to keep their eyes fixed upon the good things of heaven only, have an irre&s;i&s;tible propen&s;ity to keep their own eyes uniformly fixed upon the good things of this earth&mdash;every mo|ment, therefore, was important&mdash;to lo&s;e a minute was to lo&s;e a vicarage; and while he was talking, &s;ome other reverend brother, who had no gout in his toes, no daughter to provide for, might be po&s;ting to his Lord&s;hip in Berkeley-Square.</P>
<P>The old man became now greatly agitated; and that bo&s;om, which ought to have been the man&s;ion of re&s;igna|tion and peace, was di&s;turbed by re&s;t|le&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="039105_0009_10139C5AA7336298">
wi&s;hes, and ill-timed de&s;pair. The &s;ympathetic &s;oul of JULIA was tu|multuous; her heart throbbed with guiltle&s;s pangs, and &s;he felt for the griefs of her father. She tried to &s;oothe him, but tried in vain; &s;he argued again&s;t his wi&s;hes, but &s;he was arguing again&s;t the follies of old age, which are incurable.</P>
<P>The evening came, but came not as u&s;ual; this man of de&s;pair was un|con&s;cious of its charms&mdash;his &s;oul was deaf to the voice of nature, even when her notes were &s;weete&s;t&mdash;at the clo&s;e of the day. He li&s;tened not to the min&s;trel&s;y of the hinds, nor the cho|ral harmony of the groves; the flocks clu&s;tered in the meadows unnoticed: and the &s;un poured his evening glo|ries over the hamlet unregarded&mdash; even JULIA did not charm him: he &s;aw her kneel at his &s;ide without e|motion, and he heard her &s;ighs with|out pity.</P>
<P>Here a father and a friend was lo&s;t to happine&s;s&mdash;the only friend too &s;he had in the world&mdash;and &s;orrows much
<PB N="11" REF="039105_0010_10139C5C30A54328">
le&s;s than the&s;e would have murdered the peace of JULIA.&mdash;She had already knelt by the &s;ide of her worn parent: &s;he now cla&s;ped his hand clo&s;ely in her own, and fixing her blue eyes pa|thetically on his countenance, begged that he would not refu&s;e her one re|que&s;t&mdash;"What was that?"&mdash;To per|mit <HI>her</HI> to go to London, and &s;olicit the living.</P>
<P>Electricity could not touch him quicker. The voice of JULIA was pa|thetic, and it awakened him&mdash;his af|fections returned in an in&s;tant: he leaned over his daughter, and gave her to under&s;tand, that it was impo&s;|&s;ible to grant her reque&s;t; that he would not part with her for a bi&s;hop|rick; and that &s;he mu&s;t not think to part with him&mdash;&s;he replied; he an|&s;wered; and &s;he re-an&s;wered; in &s;hort, the conte&s;t was long, &s;tubborn, and eloquent; and though there was not much learning in it, it abounded with nature, a richer quality&mdash;&s;uffice it to &s;ay, that JULIA conquered; and &s;he obtained, with great difficulty, what
<PB N="12" REF="039105_0011_10139C60C60BC290">
&s;he called the honorable office of be|ing her father's me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved already, that di&s;patch is one of the few roads to preferment. As no time was there|fore to be lo&s;t, it was agreed that &s;he &s;hould &s;et off the next morning. The Warwick &s;tage pa&s;&s;ed through the neighbouring market-town, and &s;he might walk thither to meet it. The old man retired to get his letters rea|dy, and JULIA to make her little pre|parations for her calamitous journey.</P>
<P>How they &s;lept, them&s;elves knew be&s;t; but when the morning came, the Curate's opinions were entirely changed. "He had thought better upon the &s;ubject, and he was re&s;olved not to let her go&mdash;the roads were dangerous, and London was &s;till more &s;o&mdash;be&s;ides, &s;he might turn &s;ick&mdash;or the coach might be overturned&mdash;&s;he might be killed&mdash;and he &s;hould never &s;ee her more." JULIA knew that the&s;e fears were only the tender work|ings of timid nature, and &s;he oppo&s;ed them. In &s;hort, the conte&s;t was re|newed
<PB N="13" REF="039105_0012_10139C624BD1B220">
with its former warmth; and the affection of the daughter tri|umphed once more over the tender|ne&s;s of the father. He con&s;ented a|gain to let her go, on condition that JOE, his labourer, his gardener, his footman, his ho&s;tler, his every thing &s;hould attend her with his friendly care&mdash;&s;hould be the companion of her journey.</P>
<P>Now this JOE was the aukwarde&s;t mortal&mdash;never, &s;ure, did a more &s;im|ple '&s;quire page it at the heels of a fair lady&mdash;neither the Sancho of Don Quixote, nor the Pedrillo of Ro&s;al|va, were more arrant children of na|ture&mdash;were guided by more native &s;implicity.&mdash;He and his occupations &s;eemed made for each other, &s;o exact|ly were they re&s;pectively fitted. He was never famous but for two things; viz. for whi&s;tling, after his team, the loude&s;t and mo&s;t mu&s;ical notes of any in the village&mdash;and for knitting &s;tock|ings: this was all the reputation he had in this gairi&s;h world&mdash;on his forehead &s;at candour, unprofitably
<PB N="14" REF="039105_0013_10139C64D52C8458">
enthroned, and on his tongue truth&mdash; his vi&s;age was the &s;ymbol of integri|ty&mdash;his ruddy cheek was tinted like a cloud in the we&s;t, at the eve of a glorious day&mdash;the &s;en&s;ations of guilt had not deranged the line of human beauty!</P>
<P>Now, reader, &s;top a moment, and bethink thee of this plan, and of this journey&mdash;a village virgin, pure as the &s;now-drop in the valley, attended by a village boor, are &s;etting out for London&mdash;for <HI>London,</HI> I &s;ay&mdash;in que&s;t of a vicarage! The thing was worthy of a village curate&mdash;the de&s;cent of Eneas into hell was, in compari&s;on of this, walking upon carpets.</P>
<L>Facilis de&s;cen&s;us Averni,</L>
<L>Sed revecare gradum&mdash;</L>
<P>Our travellers were now ready to begin their walk to the market-town, which was but four miles di&s;tant. Without palfrey, armour, or other retinue, than the children of the neigh|bourhood; JULIA and her father led the van, and the re&s;t followed&mdash;JOE, as if con&s;cious that he was entering
<PB N="15" REF="039105_0014_10139C67C974AF50">
upon a &s;ervice or danger, a&s;&s;umed a &s;tatelier port and a more augu&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ion than u&s;ual; with a clean &s;hirt in his left pocket, bacon and chee&s;e in his right, and an oak &s;apling in his hand, he towered maje&s;tically in the mid&s;t of the children, with a &s;tern a&s;|pect and long &s;trides.</P>
<P>The company had now walked a mile, and were to part. On this try|ing occa&s;ion I could &s;ay much, but will not&mdash;to de&s;cribe the glances of affection, and the looks of love, which gli&s;tened in every eye&mdash;which played in every feature, would be tedious: I &s;hall therefore content my&s;elf with informing them, that in this difficult &s;cene the &s;imple heart of the curate failed him; his eyes confe&s;&s;ed it, and he played the woman. The curate marched &s;lowly back, at the head of his young flock, and our two travel|lers &s;et forward to the market-town, with ha&s;ty &s;tep and high expecta|tions.</P>
<P>Having now began a journey, we mu&s;t be expeditious. They arrived
<PB N="16" REF="039105_0015_10139C6A6B8AD5D8">
at the market-town, met the &s;tage coach, and took their appropriate &s;ta|tions&mdash;JULIA in the in&s;ide, and JOE, like her guardian angel, perched a|bove her upon the top&mdash;they went &s;moothly on, till they arrived at the lane which is three miles on the we&s;t &s;ide of Uxbridge; when a very civil gentleman came to the window, and de&s;ired them to give him all the mo|ney they had&mdash;the gentleman at the window was far from being unpolite, con&s;idering he had declared war a|gain&s;t &s;ociety&mdash;he be&s;poke them very gently, beginning at the right hand, and following them all, man by man, and woman by woman, till he went round to the left &s;ide&mdash;a boi&s;terous cornet of dragoons was unhappily the fir&s;t, and he gave his pur&s;e with a &s;ullen &s;ilence&mdash;JULIA was next, and held her little money in her hand, but dur&s;t not look towards the win|dow&mdash;a meagre cockney gave all, but begged a few &s;hillings back, to carry him to St. Paul's&mdash;a little fat woman &s;urrendered her pur&s;e, with a threat;
<PB N="17" REF="039105_0016_10139C6D097860A0">
and a plain dre&s;&s;ed man regretted he had not more for &s;o accompli&s;hed a gentleman.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the inn, each expre&s;&s;ed their &s;orrows as their feelings prompted; but they were now to enter upon their la&s;t &s;tage, and none had &s;uch weighty cau&s;e to be aggrieved as JULIA, who had not a friend before her&mdash;to go forward was madne&s;s, and to go backward was impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;what was &s;he to do?&mdash; She called in JOE, and asked if he had provided him&s;elf with any money, in ca&s;e of an emergency.&mdash;"Yes that he had&mdash;and there it was at her &s;ervice" throwing down his entire &s;tock upon the table, which amounted to the &s;um of three &s;hillings and nine-pence&mdash; this made de&s;pair more black&mdash;it was her fir&s;t misfortune; and &s;he thought it but an uncouth entrance into a ba&s;e world.</P>
<P>The officer now entered the room, and &s;eeing JOE there, began to up|braid him for &s;uffering the highway|man to e&s;cape, when he was &s;eated
<PB N="18" REF="039105_0017_10139C6FA09F7890">
&s;o advantageou&s;ly at the top, with an oaken &s;apling in his hand&mdash;"You &s;tupid oaf! (&s;aid this military hero) why did you not attack him?"&mdash; "'Ca&s;e I had not a <HI>&s;woard</HI> by my &s;ide, like you (replied JOE, with the greate&s;t frankne&s;s)&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;! icod, every man to his trade, <HI>mea&s;ter!</HI>" The argument was unan&s;werable.</P>
<P>The officer now walked up to JU|LIA, who&s;e embarra&s;&s;ment he perceiv|ed; and, taking her a&s;ide, told her he gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e of her &s;orrow; and that he was happy he had it in his power to remove it: For (con|tinued he) I know the road too well to venture my all upon it, and leave my&s;elf unprovided with re&s;ources. Here (&s;aid he, untying his &s;tock, and &s;haking out of it a &s;lender green pur&s;e) here is my <HI>corps de re&s;erve:</HI> I gave the robber a few &s;hillings, and I &s;ecured this for your u&s;e." Now JU|LIA examined the face of this affair &s;imply as it &s;tood&mdash;it was a ca&s;e of ne|ce&s;&s;ity; and &s;he thought it ridiculous for one who was many, many miles
<PB N="19" REF="039105_0018_10139C73246F3D70">
from Elmwood, and who had not two-pence in her pocket, to refu&s;e the loan of a few guineas, which would remove all her &s;orrows. She might have an opportunity of hint|ing the matter to Lord C&mdash; when &s;he &s;aw him, who would no doubt advance the money upon the vicar|age, and thus all would be right a|gain&mdash;&s;he therefore thanked him po|litely, and told him that when &s;he &s;aw her noble friend Lord C&mdash;, &s;he hoped to be able to repay him. "Lord C&mdash;! (&s;aid he)&mdash;what&mdash;you are going to vi&s;it him?" "Yes, Sir."&mdash; "O&mdash;a relation I pre&s;ume, madam?" "No, Sir! only a friend: his Lord|&s;hip and my father were great friends when they were young, and at &s;chool." "Aye, aye&mdash;your father, I pre&s;ume, Madam, lives in the country?"&mdash; "Yes, Sir; he's Curate of Elmwood, near*****in Warwick&s;hire." "Your vi&s;it, Ma'am&mdash;is it a vi&s;it of plea&s;ure or bu&s;ine&s;s?" "Bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir; I am only come to town with a letter from
<PB N="20" REF="039105_0019_10139C74A9B71B90">
my father to Lord C&mdash;, to &s;olicit the living of*****." "Oh, I under|&s;tand you, Ma'am. Lord C&mdash;, is my particular acquaintance, and it will give me plea&s;ure to be your pro|tector and your guide, till I deliver you &s;afely and honorably to his Lord|&s;hip. Would you choo&s;e to alight, Ma'am, at any particular place in Lon|don?" "No (&s;aid the &s;imple JULIA) I intend to &s;tay at the inn all night, and to wait upon his Lord&s;hip in the morning." "Ah! Madam (replied the officer) you do not know the con|fu&s;ion, the di&s;gu&s;t, and danger you will meet with at the inn: I have a mother in town, who lives elegantly: be prevailed upon to be lodged this night at her hou&s;e: &s;he will receive you with cheerfulne&s;s, and treat you with tenderne&s;s. May I peri&s;h, Madam, may I beg the honor to know your name, Madam?" "JULIA." "May I peri&s;h, Mi&s;s JULIA, but I am intere&s;ted in your ca&s;e, as &s;incerely as if you were my own &s;i&s;ter!" This la&s;t propo&s;al was better and better.
<PB N="21" REF="039105_0020_10139C7776CF6328">
To meet &s;o good a friend at once! She was &s;ure her father's prayers for her were heard; and &s;he thought &s;he could not be too thankful to heaven, nor to the gentleman. She accepted his offer; and they mounted the &s;tage coach once more.</P>
<P>As the &s;tage-coachman was at this place paid his full demand, there was nothing to be done but to roll into town, and go where they plea&s;ed. The fat woman lived in Holborn, and the coach &s;topt to &s;et her down. "Here too, Madam, (&s;aid the officer to JU|LIA) we may get out, for we are near our home." The artful abruptne&s;s and hurry of the &s;ummons, the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of finding her&s;elf &s;uddenly in the mid&s;t of the immen&s;e metro|polis, where &s;he already &s;aw &s;trange things, and expected to &s;ee &s;till &s;trang|er, her total ignorance of every thing around her; her hopes, her expecta|tions, her &s;implicity, all contributed to throw her mind into confu&s;ion, and her &s;pirits into a &s;lutter: &s;he for|got
<PB N="22" REF="039105_0021_10139C7939001A20">
every thing, &s;he forgot even JOE, and JOE, alas! forgot her; for he was exactly in the &s;ame predicament. He was a&s;toni&s;hed; he was in a new world: his recollection for&s;ook him, and a mi&s;t wandered over his eyes&punc; he &s;at nailed to the top of the coach, with his mouth open, looking at eve|ry thing and &s;eeing nothing. In this cloud JULIA e&s;caped; and &s;he neither &s;poke nor looked around her, till her gallant commander led her into Lin|coln's-Inn-Fields. Now, when a young gentleman, with a young lady by his &s;ide, who is re&s;olved to follow him, finds him&s;elf in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, the road to Covent-Garden lies di|rect: 'tis only going up Queen-&s;treet, cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>lane</HI> and the <HI>acre,</HI> and there you are. He conducted her into a hou&s;e in the Piazza; where the polite inhabitants received the young gentleman with all the free|dom and civility of an old acquaint|ance, which convinced JULIA that he was <HI>quite at home.</HI></P>
<P>Now, gentle reader, while JULIA
<PB N="23" REF="039105_0022_10139C7D1EFAC170">
and her friend are &s;eated at a bottle of Madeira, recollect and confe&s;s, whether we have not journied well; from the banks of the Avon, from the man&s;ion of innocence, from the warm bo&s;om of a father, to place our rural virgin on the very throne of perdition. Now, ye guardian &s;pirits, whether Sylphs, Genii, or Fairies; if ye have any regard for devoted pu|rity, now open your golden eyes, now ply your &s;ilver pinions, for innocence is in danger. And now, thou wrench|ed old man, thou ambitious Curate of Elmwood, rekindle your piety, and redouble your prayers, for your daughter, your <HI>JULIA is in a Bagnio,</HI> and without a fear!</P>
<P>Every thing that pa&s;&s;ed around <HI>JULIA</HI> in this hou&s;e appeared too plau&s;ible for her eyes to be opened, or her &s;u&s;picion to be rou&s;ed, for &s;he had never been in a tavern before: and as to the ince&s;&s;ant tinkling of bells, and the ince&s;&s;ant running of waiters; why, bells and &s;ervants mu&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="039105_0023_10139C80D6993B88">

out immediately, that it was a &s;ham! and JULIA prote&s;ted in vain &mdash;The company around heard this with an arch &s;mile; the watchmen &s;hook their heads, and the con&s;table grew noi&s;y; which awakened an old gentleman who had hitherto &s;lept very &s;oundly in a corner.

<P>At the expiration of this time JU|LIA aro&s;e. Snoring Dick had retir|ed for an hour, to &s;leep away the fatigues of the night and of the beer pot.

<P>This repa&s;t over, Dick awakened; JULIA, who was during breakfa&s;t time devi&s;ing what mea&s;ures to fol|low, propo&s;ed at fir&s;t to engage him to go along with her to the inn where JOE and the &s;tage-coach were; but on recollecting the dangers &s;he had already experienced in the &s;treets, &s;he re&s;olved not to venture upon it a|gain, without a better guide than her friend the watchman. She therefore judged it more prudent to hire him to go to the inn, and to bring JOE along with him to the place where &s;he was. Dick readily a&s;&s;ented to this propo&s;al for the hire of a half crown; which, he &s;tipulated, &s;hould be paid him before he &s;et off, as well as the crown for the bed. All this he received on the &s;pot, with the let|ter for her father to be put into the po&s;t-office. He now departed, a&s;&s;ur|ing her, that though &s;he had not the

<P>It was now rather more than din|ner time, but neither Dick nor JOE appeared&mdash;JULIA was unea&s;y. Four o'clock &s;truck, but brought no com|fort with it. It was five&mdash;but nobody arrived. Six, &s;even, eight&mdash;nobody. During the&s;e intervals &s;he paid fre|quent vi&s;its to an object in di&s;tre&s;s, in the adjoining chamber, and charged her ho&s;te&s;s with great &s;incerity, at whatever time &s;he went away, to be attentive to his nece&s;&s;ities till her re|turn.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid it was now eight o'clock, and nobody appeared. She became very, very unea&s;y. It was now half pa&s;t eight. "Still nobody!&mdash;Good Heaven! are my misfortunes never to end?" At about a quarter before nine, two of Sir John Fielding's men entered the room, with Dick&mdash;drunk, very drunk&mdash;at their head.</P>

que&s;t of JULIA; and I'll lay you plums to pippins that you cannot conjecture their bu&s;ine&s;s with her.</P>
<P>To under&s;tand it, your memory mu&s;t recur to the adventures of JU|LIA with the highwayman. He had met with her in the bagnio, and giv|en her a pur&s;e with money in it, and in their departare from thence, the highwayman was &s;eized&mdash;JULIA fled, and was by chance conducted to the Round Hou&s;e. The generous high|wayman was apprehended upon the information of the contemptible &s;on of Mars, already noted. When this coxcomb arrived at the office, the fat woman of Holborn had alighted there upon the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s. As the highwayman therefore was &s;ecured, the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s thought nece&s;&s;ary was to &s;earch him, and all the differ|ent pur&s;es of the company were found upon him, except that of the fat wo|man.&mdash;It was agreed that he could not have &s;pent it in &s;o &s;hort a time: <HI>ergo,</HI> he mu&s;t have given it away.
<PB N="46" REF="039105_0045_10139CB8E2798FC0">
To corroborate the &s;u&s;picion, the men recollected that a woman was along with him when he was appre|hended, and the perfumed officer con|firmed it. The ca&s;e was therefore plain; JULIA mu&s;t have the pur&s;e in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Away they &s;allied, with the officers at their head, through the &s;treets, bagnios, taverns, and night-hou&s;es; but in vain: &s;he was no where to be found. The next night, between eight and nine, one of them met Dick the watchman: (Dick was at this time returning to JULIA without any an&s;wer or infor|mation; for in&s;tead of going on her errand, he went to get drunk with her money.) The thieftaker inquir|ed of him by chance, as the adven|ture happened within his circuit, if he had &s;een &s;uch a lady. After de&s;crib|ing her very minutely&mdash;"Seen her! (&s;aid Dick) why, &s;he is at my hou&s;e." This information was &s;ufficient for the &s;ervant of ju&s;tice: he took Dick by the arm, and &s;ummoning one of his companions, &s;et off for the lodging of JULIA.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="039105_0046_10139CBB72ACB3B8">We have already &s;een them intro|duced where &s;he was. They &s;eized her without ceremony, and proceed|ed as u&s;ual to &s;earch her. The fatal pur&s;e, &s;o remarkable for the golden ta&s;&s;el at either end, was in a moment found. This confirmed the &s;u&s;pi|cion, and &s;he was carried away as an accomplice.&mdash;When will per&s;ecution cea&s;e to follow virtue?</P>
<P>Sir John was not that night at home, and they informed her that &s;he mu&s;t be impri&s;oned till morning. &mdash;<HI>Impri&s;|oned</HI>! She &s;hrieked at the very &s;ound. &mdash;"P&s;haw (&s;aid one of them, &s;eeing her confu&s;ion) you need not be ter|rified, I a&s;&s;ure you, ma'am: we are not going to a common pri&s;on&mdash;I have a pretty little &s;nug hou&s;e, and as clo&s;e as a cage, where you may &s;leep as &s;oundly as in your own bed-cham|ber. No difference in the world, I a&s;|&s;ure you, Ma'am&mdash;only that every door and window in the hou&s;e is in|clo&s;ed with iron bars. &mdash;That's all I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am, and notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e advantages, it will only co&s;t

<P>Eloquent and agreeable as this lan|guage certainly was, it did not glad|den the heart of JULIA. But there was no choice in the ca&s;e, and &s;he followed her guides&mdash;arrived, they led her into an upper appartment, where there was a fire and good furniture&mdash;She was left alone for ten minutes; at the end of which the landlord waited upon her, and a&s;ked what &s;he cho&s;e for &s;upper. "Nothing."&mdash;What did &s;he choo&s;e to drink? "Nothing."&mdash; "Oh, oh, (replied he) an' if &s;o be that you are &s;o <HI>ru&s;ty,</HI> good night to you, with all my heart." He then turned upon his heels; and pulling the door after him with fury, locked it with a key, which grated as it turn|ed, amid&s;t the rattling of chains and the clanking of iron bars.</P>
<P>Dreadful &s;ounds to the ear of JU|LIA&mdash;her teeth grated, and her joints trembled&mdash;this was the &s;evere&s;t &s;troke

of all. To be impri&s;oned! and as an accomplice of a highwayman too!&mdash; But &s;he &s;ubmitted to Heaven.</P>
<P>At length the &s;oul, by its powerful and violent plunging, overcame the body&mdash;Wearied with affliction, her &s;pirit langui&s;hed, and nature &s;unk in|to &s;lumber.

<P>Here &s;he did not wait long for the appearance or the ju&s;tice, for every thing was prepared; even the unhap|py highwayman was in waiting, as nece&s;&s;ary to the examination.&mdash;In|deed, it was thought mo&s;t proper to begin que&s;tioning him apart upon the &s;ubject, and then with examining JU+LIA! and by the compari&s;on of their re&s;pective evidences the truth might be ea&s;ily di&s;covered.</P>
<P>When the highwayman had been
<PB N="50" REF="039105_0049_10139CBF1976BCE0">
examined upon his own account, an ob&s;tinacy, natural to men in his de&s;|perate &s;ituation, prevented him from giving any account of the pur&s;e which was mi&s;&s;ing. But now when he was informed that JULIA was really in cu&s;tody, that honor which was not yet entirely extingui&s;hed in his heart, was rou&s;ed for her &s;afety&mdash;he ingenu|ou&s;ly told SIR JOHN the hi&s;tory of the pur&s;e, with even its mo&s;t minute cir|cum&s;tances; that he had robbed her among the re&s;t; that he afterwards met her accidentally in the bagnio, and gave her the money only with a view of re&s;toring her own, that he had not been above ten minutes in her company, and that &s;he was in ev|ery re&s;pect innocent of the crime with which &s;he was charged.</P>
<P>JULIA was next examined, and her evidence mo&s;t exactly &s;quared with the former. Ingenuous as u&s;ual, &s;he took up the &s;tory at Elmwood, and carried it forward to the event of the pur&s;e; and &s;he told her little tale with that truth and &s;implicity which can

never be counterfeited. She added that there was <HI>&s;omewhere</HI> in town a per&s;on who could confirm her words beyond &s;u&s;picion! but alas! poor JOE! &s;he knew not where to find him.
<Q>JOE! (&s;aid one of the ju&s;tice's men, who &s;tood behind JULIA)&mdash;what is your name JULIA, Madam?</Q>

now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;JULIA li&s;ten|ed to it with attention, and confe&s;&s;ed her feelings in her eyes, which gli&s;|tened with expectations. Not con|tented with aural information, &s;he &s;natched the paper, and devoured the precious mor&s;el with her own eyes. In &s;hort the &s;implicity of the thing &s;poke for it&s;elf, and JOE it was mo&s;t undoubtedly.</P>
<P>But it may be nece&s;&s;ary to explain this affair. I again &s;ummon the mem|ory of my readers back to the time of our hi&s;tory when JOE and JULIA unluckily parted in Holborn&mdash;JOE did not look for her till the coach &s;top|ped in the inn-yard, and then he wai|ted at the door of it for her appear|ance. He thought her long in com|ing, but his patience was not exhau&s;|ted, the re&s;t of the company had been out of the coach &s;ome minutes. At length he ventured to thru&s;t in his head&mdash;but &s;he was not there! He &s;tar|ted back on his heel, and gazed wide|ly round the yard but in vain. Oppo|&s;ite to him he &s;aw the door of a pub|lic

room open, and he ru&s;hed in with|out ceremony: from thence he &s;allied into the kitchen, &s;trode into the par|lour, threw his eye into the bar, and peeped into the larder. He marched into the &s;tables, and in &s;hort every place where he &s;aw a door open to re|ceive him&mdash;but all would not do: &s;he was not to be found. He returned to the coach, took one peep more into it, but all was &s;olitary! "God ble&s;s my heart (&s;aid JOE to him&s;elf, fid|getting and &s;cratching among his au|burn hair) prote&s;t and &s;ave me from all temptations and evil &s;pirits! I wi&s;h could &s;ee Mi&s;s JULIA again." Now at la&s;t, he bethought him&s;elf of what he ought to have done at fir&s;t, viz. to que&s;tion the coachman concerning the affair, and the coachman infor|med him of the whole truth. This information in no degree abated his anxiety.&mdash;"Didn't &s;he leave no word with you for me?" (&s;aid he to the coachman.) "No."&mdash;"Don't you now where &s;he went?"&mdash;"No."</P>

this night?"&mdash;"I can't tell you, up|on my word."&mdash;JOE, with downca&s;t looks and folded arms, mea&s;ured the &s;pace acro&s;s the yard with long and melancholy &s;trides. He walked into the pa&s;&s;age of the hou&s;e, and marked the clock&mdash;he counted the hours as they rolled, &s;low and heavy, but he &s;aw not his mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;it was now ten o'clock, but no JULIA came.</P>
<P>They are not the &s;evere&s;t, but they are the mo&s;t anxious moments the mind knows, when the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it, &s;imple, timid, and hone&s;t, feels him|&s;elf far from home, and for&s;aken, in the mid&s;t of &s;trangers&mdash;the&s;e mo|ments JOE now felt in all their bitter|ne&s;s &mdash;he went to bed without hope, and he aro&s;e in the morning with de&s;|pair &mdash;he grieved ince&s;&s;antly, and he wi&s;hed for the bo&s;om of a friend to receive his &s;orrows&mdash;at length he di&s;|clo&s;ed his mind to the ho&s;tler, and the ho&s;tler gave him his advice&mdash; It was this: <HI>To adverti&s;e</HI>&mdash;"Every+body (he &s;aid) did it, upon every &s;ubject.

<HI>hor&s;e,</HI> he adverti&s;ed for it; and why might not JOE do the &s;ame now for <HI>JULIA</HI>?&mdash;It would certainly lay open the whole affair, for adverti&s;ements could do any thing."</P>
<P>At this time JOE &s;tood too greatly in need of comfort, not to take any advice that was offered to him.&mdash;But he thought this advice excellent. He accordingly wrote, with great care, the adverti&s;ement we have already repeated, and the ho&s;tler &s;ent one of his boys with him to the <HI>Daily Adver|ti&s;er.</HI> And this is the hi&s;tory of this extraordinary adverti&s;ement.</P>
<P>When the ju&s;tice found &s;o many circum&s;tances &s;pontaneou&s;ly con&s;pir|ing to vindicate her innocence&mdash;that her amiable &s;implicity &s;ubjected her to &s;o many dangers, and that &s;he was the object rather of a polite humani|ty than of per&s;ecution, he re&s;olved to intere&s;t him&s;elf in her &s;afety&mdash;and, in the fir&s;t place, he ordered one of his men to go and conduct JOE to his mi&s;|tre&s;s &mdash;as to the fat woman, the Ma|i&s;trate
<PB N="56" REF="039105_0055_10139CC4D85ECCD0">
told her that her money &s;hould be taken care of; and the highway|man was remanded to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>JOE arrived&mdash;&s;uffice it to &s;ay, that <HI>JULIA</HI> pre&s;&s;ed him warmly by the hand, and half cried with joy; and JOE took fa&s;t hold of the &s;kirt of her robe, as if he dreaded her running a|way from him once more.</P>
<P>The friends thus met, the ju&s;tice politely a&s;ked <HI>JULIA</HI> how he could mo&s;t effectually &s;erve her? She replied, that her only bu&s;ine&s;s in town was to deliver letters to Lord C&mdash;, and that if he would favour her with a guide thither, &s;he would always re|member him with the mo&s;t unfeigned gratitude&mdash;this &s;he obtained; and, once more acknowledging her obliga|tions to the ju&s;tice, they all &s;et off for Berkley-&s;quare.</P>
<P>Here they &s;oon arrived, the guide leaving them at the door.&mdash;JOE im|mediately took of his hat, for he thought it high trea&s;on to be cover|ed within &s;ix yards of a <HI>Lord's</HI> door &mdash;they knocked, but were told by the

porter his Lord&s;hip was not at home &mdash;<HI>JULIA</HI> &s;aid &s;he was &s;orry for that, becau&s;e &s;he had <HI>letters of importance</HI> for him. "I can't help that (an&s;wered the porter) he's not at home; and he'll not be home&mdash;I don't know when he'll be home." "But could not you gue&s;s, Sir?&mdash;becau&s;e a <HI>great deal de|pends upon it.</HI>"&mdash;"Lord Ma'am!

"Pray, my lad, (&s;aid this dog in office) who is that?"</P>
<P>"My mi&s;tre&s;s" (an&s;wered JOE.)</P>
<P>"Aye&mdash;From the country, I &s;up|po&s;e?"</P>

<P>"Sure I am, Ma&s;ter (an&s;wered JOE) indeed we are both very much obliged to you for being &s;o kind.&mdash; But then what can you do for us, if &s;o be that my Lord a'n't at home?" P&s;haw, man!

<P><PB N="59" REF="039105_0058_10139D028003F7A0">"O&mdash;an' that be all (replied JOE) I can pay the money my&s;elf."</P>
<P>He drew out his la&s;t half-crown and gave it. He then ran after <HI>JU|LIA,</HI> and as he went he murmured to him&s;elf&mdash;"Icod tho', wern't that a <HI>Lord's</HI> hou&s;e, it looks hugely like bri|bery and corruption."</P>
<P>Our travellers now returned, and were received by the porter with a more gracious complai&s;ance. He now informed them, that, tho' his Lord&s;hip was out of town, he was on|ly at his villa, and would certainly return to town to dinner; but that if they were in a hurry, the young Lord was at home, and that he had leave to open his father's letters in his ab&s;ence. JULIA delivered her pacquet to the porter, and they were ordered to walk into the anti-cham|ber. The letters were &s;ent up to the noble youth in his dre&s;&s;ing-room.</P>

He was deep in the my&s;|teries of hazard, and knew DEMOIVRE better than the Decalogue.&mdash;He had killed five waiters, and &s;hot two eccle|&s;ia&s;tics. &mdash;He boa&s;ted too, that he had killed fifteen women, by <HI>breaking their hearts</HI> with a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion.

<P>While the venerable old Peer was in the act of preparation to &s;eal and &s;ub&s;cribe this letter, in order that it might be &s;ent to JULIA, the Curate entered, but, in &s;eeing the object of his recent re&s;entment, he was going to retire, under the apprehen&s;ion that he might be tran&s;acting &s;ome private bu&s;ine&s;s with his father.&mdash;"Stop, Sir, (&s;aid the old nobleman,) I want you to be witne&s;s to an act of retribution; read this letter, and then inform me if the apology is proportioned to the offence."

it be for human-kind, if all tran&s;gre&s;&s;|ions were thus under&s;tood, and thus obliterated. "You mu&s;t not be a|mazed my Lord, (added he, turning to his patron) if I feel &s;en&s;ations near|ly approaching to ec&s;ta&s;y, on this theme, as the object of this letter has con&s;ented to be my wife."&mdash;"Your wife!" ejaculated both in the &s;ame in&s;tant! "It is even &s;o, (rejoined the worthy Curate) provided your Lord|&s;hip has no objection to the union." So far am I, Sir, from di&s;approving your choice, that I mu&s;t in&s;tantly go and give the bride elect joy; and you my &s;on, &s;hall go too, and prove, by your pre&s;ent demeanor, that you are a&s;hamed of the pa&s;t: this is a duty that all will fulfill with cheerfulne&s;s: When virtue is rewarded all that think &s;hould rejoice."</P>
<P>Here let the reader ponder upon the unde&s;cribable emotions, which played about the &s;u&s;ceptible heart of JULIA, from the momentous period that &s;he was left with the Curate, un|til &s;he was congratulated on their re|turn
