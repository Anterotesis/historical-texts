<P>THE <HI>Words</HI> are part of a raptrous and heavenly <HI>Song,</HI> utter'd by a devout, in&s;pir'd and tran&s;ported <HI>Mother in I&s;rael,</HI> upon a great and joyful Occa&s;ion. If the DI|VINE ETERNAL SPIRIT plea&s;e to in&s;pire and &s;peak by a gracious <HI>Woman,</HI> it is the &s;ame thing to us, and requires our reverend Attention as much, as if he rai&s;e up a <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> or an <HI>Elias,</HI> or make His Revelations by a <HI>Paul</HI> or <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003262_0004_0FEFDAD05E8A2550">
<HI>Samuel,</HI> the rare and wonderful Son of in&s;pir'd <HI>Hannah,</HI> never out&s;pake his lovely Mother in any of his Prayers or Acts of Prai&s;e. <HI>Eli</HI> would have &s;at at her Feet, and laid him&s;elf in the Du&s;t, at the hearing of this flowing Torrent of fervent Devotion from her beauteous Lips; And <HI>Saints</HI> thro' all Ages hang on the heavenly Mu&s;ic of her Tongue.</P>
<P>Great things are here &s;aid of GOD, and of His Government, in the Families and Kingdoms of Men; and &s;uch wi&s;e and ju&s;t Ob&s;ervations are made, as are worthy of deep Contemplation by the greate&s;t and be&s;t of Men. Had She like <HI>Deborah</HI> been the Prince&s;s of the Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> She could not have &s;poken with more Loftine&s;s and Maje&s;ty, with more Authority and Command; nor better have addre&s;s'd the Nobles and Rulers, the Captains and the Mighty Men; to humble and lay 'em low before GOD.</P>
<P><Q>She celebrates the LORD GOD of <HI>I&s;rael</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry</HI> in loc.</NOTE>, his un&s;potted Purity, his Almighty Power, his un&s;earch|able Wi&s;dom, and his unerring Ju&s;tice:</Q></P>
<P>In the Prai&s;es of The&s;e She joys and triumphs, her Heart was exalted and her Mouth enlarged.</P>
<P><Q>She adores the DIVINE SOVEREIGNTY in its Di&s;po&s;als of the Affairs of the Children of Men; in the &s;trange and &s;udden Turns given to them; in the Ri&s;e &amp; Fall of Per&s;ons, Families &amp; Countries.</Q></P>
<P><Q>She ob&s;erves how the <HI>Strong</HI> are &s;oon weakned, and the <HI>Weak</HI> are &s;oon &s;trengthned, when GOD plea&s;es: How the <HI>Rich</HI> are &s;oon impoveri&s;h'd, and the <HI>Poor</HI> inriched on a &s;udden: How <HI>empty</HI> Families are repleni&s;h'd, and <HI>numerous</HI> Families dimini&s;hed:</Q> All this is of the LORD; <HI>He maketh poor and maketh rich, He bringeth low and lifteth up: He rai&s;eth up the poor out of Du&s;t, and lifteth up the Beggar from the Dunghill; to &s;et them among Princes, and make them inherit the Throne of Glory; "For the Pillars of the Earth are the LORD's, and He hath &s;et the World upon them.</HI></P>

Thus my <HI>Text</HI> is introduced as a Rea&s;on for tho&s;e Di&s;pen&s;ations of GOD towards a Per&s;on, a Family, or a People, which at any time are to us mo&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;ing and admirable.</P>
<P N="1">1. The things &s;poken of are great and mighty; <HI>The Pillars of the Earth.</HI> The Earth is a va&s;t Fabrick&punc; and in Proportion to its mighty Bulk mu&s;t its Pillars be.</P>
<P>The <HI>Metaphor</HI> is plainly taken from <HI>Architecture;</HI> as in &s;tately, &s;pacious and magnificent Structures we often &s;ee Rows of Pillars, to &s;u&s;tain the Roof and lofty Towers. But whether we apply this manner of Expre&s;&s;ion to the <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>moral</HI> Earth, it is figurative and not literal.</P>
<P>The <HI>natural Earth</HI> has no Pillar. The Will and Word of GOD is its only <HI>Ba&s;is.</HI> It &s;eems to us who dwell on it fix'd and immoveable in the Air. It keeps it's Place and Line there, as if it were &s;et on &s;ome la&s;ting &s;olid Pillars, and never mov'd at all.</P>
<P>We darkly <HI>Philo&s;ophi&s;e</HI> upon the Point, and talk of the <HI>Poles</HI> of Heaven; which are more unintelligible to a common Audience than the Pillars of it. We &s;peak ob&s;curely of the Earth's being fixed on it's own <HI>Center.</HI> And we di&s;cour&s;e more intelligibly of the &s;ecret Power of <HI>Magneti&s;m</HI> which is in Matter; whereby Bodies mutually <HI>attract</HI> or <HI>gravitate</HI> toward each other; By which the mighty Globes of the Univer&s;e pre&s;erve their Di&s;tance, Motion and Order.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be the only natural <HI>Pillar</HI> of the <HI>Earth:</HI> The amazing Work and Power of GOD. And the <HI>Planets</HI> which roll in the &s;ame <HI>Circle</HI> with us, have all of 'em the &s;ame Pillars. That is to &s;ay, "All Bodies thro' the whole <HI>Solar Sy&s;tem</HI> attract or gravitate toward each other, with Forces according to their Quantities of Matter.</P>
<P>But after all this fine Doctrine in our <HI>New Phi|lo&s;ophy,</HI> concerning the <HI>Centripetal Forces</HI> of the Sun
<PB N="4" REF="003262_0006_0FEFDB0C232DD818">
and Planets; a plain Chri&s;tian is much more edified by the &s;imple and vulgar Account which the <HI>&s;acred Pages</HI> give us of this my&s;terious Thing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxvi. 7. P&s;alm xxiv. 2.</NOTE>: <HI>"He &s;tretcheth out the North over the empty &s;pace, and hangeth the Earth upon nothing! He hath founded it upon the Seas, and e&s;tabli&s;hed it upon the Floods.</HI> Which is to &s;ay, "No Man knows <HI>how</HI> or <HI>where,</HI> this va&s;t material Frame finds it's Ba&s;is and Station.</P>
<P>Let us hear GOD again on the point, and &s;ay no more upon it; Job xxxviii. <HI>Who is this that darkneth Coun&s;el by Words without Knowledge? Gird up now thy Loins like a Man; for I will demand of thee, and an&s;wer thou Me. Where wa&s;t thou when I laid the Foundations of the Earth? Declare if thou ha&s;t Under&s;tanding. Who hath laid the Mea&s;ures thereof, if thou knowe&s;t? Or who hath &s;tretched the Line upon it? Whereupon are the Foundations thereof fa&s;tned? or who laid the Corner-&s;tone thereof?</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ee then that the <HI>natural</HI> Earth has no Pillars, in any proper Sen&s;e; Neither has the <HI>moral</HI> Earth, (<HI>i. e.</HI> The Inhabitants of it) any, but in a <HI>Metapho|rical</HI> Sen&s;e: And &s;o the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Rulers</HI> of it are called it's Pillars; becau&s;e the Affairs of the World ly upon their Shoulders, and turn upon their Conduct and Management, in a very great Degree.</P>
<P>And thus the <HI>Text</HI> explains it &s;elf, and is to be in|terpreted from the &s;cope of our <HI>Context;</HI> which &s;peaks of <HI>the Bows of the mighty Men,</HI> and of <HI>the Thrones of Princes,</HI> and then adds&mdash;<HI>the Pillars of the Earth.</HI> So that by PILLARS we are to under&s;tand <HI>Governours</HI> and <HI>Rulers</HI> among Men; but not the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> that bear Rule, &s;o much as the <HI>Order</HI> it &s;elf, <HI>Government and Magi&s;tracy.</HI> For the Per&s;ons may be weak and &s;lender <HI>Reeds,</HI> little able of them&s;elves to bear up any thing; and here and there they may fall; but the Order &s;tands and doth indeed uphold the World.</P>

2. The things &s;aid of <HI>the&s;e</HI> Pillars of the Earth are al&s;o very great: <HI>"They are the LORD's,</HI> and <HI>"He has &s;et the World upon them.</HI> That is to &s;ay, The Order and Happine&s;s of this lower World, the Peace and Weal of it, depend on the Civil Government which GOD has ordained in it.

<P>The <HI>Pillar</HI> is a Part of great U&s;e and Honour in the Building: So is <HI>Magi&s;tracy</HI> in the World. One <HI>Style</HI> in Scripture for it is, <HI>Foundations</HI> and <HI>Corner-&s;tones.</HI> Where we read of <HI>the Chief</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judges xx. 2.</NOTE> <HI>of the People,</HI> in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> it is <HI>the Corners.</HI> We read al&s;o of the<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxxii.</NOTE> <HI>Foun|dations of the Earth being out of Cour&s;e.</HI> The mea|ning is, the <HI>Government</HI> of it was &s;o. <HI>Kings</HI> bear up and &s;upport the Inferior Pillars of Government, and a righteous Admini&s;tration re&s;tores a di&s;&s;olving State: P&s;al. lxxv. 3. <HI>The Earth and all the Inhabitants thereof are di&s;&s;olved: I bear up the 'Pillars of it.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, Wi&s;e and faithful <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> are Pil|lars in the <HI>Church:</HI> Which <HI>is built on the Prophets and Apo&s;tles,</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>being the chief Corner|&s;tone,</HI> Eph. ii. 20. The Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was made by GOD <HI>an Iron Pillar:</HI> And of <HI>Peter, James</HI> and <HI>John</HI> we read, that <HI>they &s;eemed to be Pillars:</HI> Gal. ii. 9. They were de&s;ervedly &s;o reputed, and truly &s;o in the Church of CHRIST. Famous are the LORD's Words
<PB N="6" REF="003262_0008_0FF02ECDB9C80DA0">
to <HI>Peter,</HI> Matth. xvi. 18. <HI>Thou art</HI> PETER, <HI>and on this Rock will I build my Church.</HI> And when <HI>John</HI> had the Vi&s;ion of the <HI>New-Jeru&s;alem,</HI> de&s;cending out of Heaven from GOD, it is &s;aid that <HI>the Wall of the City had twelve Foundations, and in them the Names of the twelve Apo&s;tles of the Lamb.</HI></P>
<P>Now the De&s;ign and U&s;e of Pillars in a Building is one of the&s;e two, or both together: 1. For <HI>Strength</HI> to uphold it, or 2. For <HI>Beauty</HI> to adorn it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Governments</HI> and Rulers of the Earth are its Pillars in re&s;pect of <HI>Strength</HI> to uphold and &s;up|port the Virtue, Order and Peace of it. Pillars &s;hould be made &s;trong, and commonly are &s;o; of Stone and Marble, Iron and Bra&s;s. And it had need be a <HI>&s;trong Rod</HI> to be a <HI>Sceptre to Rule,</HI> Ezek. xix. 14. <HI>Magi&s;|trates</HI> need be &s;trong, for Government is a great Weight; and it is <HI>laid upon their Shoulders.  Mo&s;es</HI> felt the Weight and &s;aid, <HI>I am not able to bear this People alone.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Governments</HI> and Rulers of the Earth are it's Pillars for <HI>Ornament,</HI> to adorn it. Pillars in a fine Buil|ding are made as <HI>beautiful</HI> as may be; They are plan'd and poli&s;h'd, wrought and carv'd with much Art and Co&s;t, painted and gilded, for Sight&punc; as well as U&s;e. As the <HI>Legs</HI> are to a Body, comely in it's goings: Such are Pillars in a &s;tately Structure for Beauty to the Eye. It is the allu&s;ion of the <HI>Spou&s;e,</HI> recounting the Beauties of her BELOVED, Cant. v. 15. <HI>His Legs are as Pillars of Marble, &s;et upon Sockets of fine Gold.</HI> A bold and elegant Compari&s;on, becoming the Pen of <HI>Solomon,</HI> who had built the <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD with all it's <HI>Pillars.</HI> They repre&s;ented the Strength of CHRIST and his <HI>Stability,</HI> to bear the Weight of the Govern|ment laid upon Him; and al&s;o the Magnificence of <HI>the Goings of GOD our King in the Sanctuary:</HI> Like|wi&s;e the Steadine&s;s of the Divine Admini&s;tration. So Tho&s;e in power and Magi&s;tracy are to be &s;uppo&s;ed, Men <HI>adorn'd</HI> with &s;uperior Gifts, Powers and Beauties of Mind: Men that adorn the World wherein they Live, and the Offices which they &s;u&s;tain. And then their
<PB N="7" REF="003262_0009_0FF02ED2F2A777E0">
Office adorns them al&s;o, and &s;ets them in con&s;picuous Places, where what is great and good in them is &s;een of all.&mdash;To be &s;ure, Government and Magi&s;tracy adorn the World as well as pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> uphold and adorn the World, as <HI>Pillars</HI> do a Fabrick, by employing their &s;uperior <HI>Wi&s;|dom</HI> and Knowledge, Skill and Prudence, Di&s;cretion and Judgment for the publick Good. The&s;e Accom|pli&s;hments are to be &s;uppo&s;ed in the Civil Order, and they render 'em the Pillars of the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> is both Strength and Beauty, a Defence and Ornament. So <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;hines among Kings, for <HI>the Wi&s;dom of GOD was in Him. GOD gave him Wi&s;|dom and Knowledge exceeding much, and Largene&s;s of Heart even as the Sand upon the Sea-&s;hore.</HI> Angels excel in Strength, and Rulers &s;hould be wi&s;e as the Angels of GOD. The Government is laid on CHRIST becau&s;e in Him are hid all the Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge. He is the Wi&s;dom of GOD and the Power of GOD. As GOD at fir&s;t founded the Earth by his Wi&s;dom, and by his Under&s;tanding e&s;tabli&s;hed the Heavens; &s;o by the Communication of Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding to &s;ome, He pre&s;erves the Order and Happine&s;s of Others on it. What is &s;aid of a Hou&s;e is true of a State, <HI>"Thro' Wi&s;dom it is builded, and by Under&s;tanding it is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and by Know|ledge &s;hall the Chambers be filled with all precious and plea&s;ant Riches: A wi&s;e Man is &s;trong, yea a Man of Knowledge increa&s;eth Strength</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiv 3, 4, 5. 1 Cor. i. 24. Col. ii 3. 2 Sam. xiv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But then, Is the Pillar for <HI>Ornament?</HI> What is more <HI>beautiful</HI> than Knowledge and Wi&s;dom? What more adorns a Man, a Place, a Country? The <HI>Queen of Sheba</HI> came far to hear the Wi&s;dom of <HI>Solomon,</HI> and <HI>Huram</HI> was as much &s;truck as &s;he was: 2 Chron. ii. 12. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the LORD GOD of I&s;rael, who hath given to David the King a wi&s;e Son, endued
<PB N="8" REF="003262_0010_0FF02ED5D600EB58">
with Prudence and Under&s;tanding, who may build a Hou&s;e for the LORD, and an Hou&s;e for the King|dom.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Integrity, Uprightne&s;s, Faithfulne&s;s</HI> added to Knowledge and Wi&s;dom, makes Men &s;trong and beau|tiful <HI>Pillars,</HI> whether in Church or State. Every Man is ready to pretend to a Competency of Wi&s;dom, and as ready <HI>to proclaim his own Goodne&s;s; but a faithful Man who can find?</HI> Prov. xx. 6. He is a rare and beau|teous Spectacle, as <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, Samuel, Jehojada, Hezekiah</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> in their Times, and to the End of Time. All that rule over Men &s;hould be like to <HI>The&s;e, ju&s;t Men Ruling in the Fear of the LORD;</HI> and then they are to the World as the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Rain,</HI> without which the Earth mu&s;t peri&s;h. As Dark|ne&s;s vani&s;hes before the Light, &s;o <HI>a King that &s;itteth upon the Throne of Judgment &s;cattereth away all Evil with his Eyes.</HI> DAVID, that Pillar of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> came into the Government with that noble Purpo&s;e and Re|&s;olution, P&s;al. lxxv. 3. <HI>When I &s;hall receive the Con|gregation, I will judge uprightly.</HI> So he fed Them in the <HI>Integrity</HI> of his Heart, and led them by the Skil|fulne&s;s of his Hands. GOD's Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Faith|fulne&s;s, <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> are the Foundation of His everla&s;ting Government, <HI>the Habitation of His Throne.</HI> See the Pillars of the Divine Government, P&s;al. xxxvi. 5, 6. <HI>Thy Faithfulne&s;s reacheth to the Clouds, thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s is as the great Mountains.</HI> Nor can the Kingdoms and Provinces on the Earth &s;tand, but on the like Ba&s;is of a ju&s;t and righteous Humane Government. P&s;al. lxxii. 3. <HI>The Mountains &s;hall bring Peace to the People, and the little Hills by Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> <Q>Both the Superior and Inferior Magi&s;trates &s;hall mini&s;ter abundantly to the Stability and Tranquility of the State.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A publick and enlarged Spirit</HI> for the common Weal and a &s;ingle Regard thereunto, without &s;uffering our &s;elves to be mi&s;led by private and &s;elfi&s;h Views: This renders Men <HI>Pillars</HI> to the World, in the Places wherein <HI>Providence</HI> &s;ets 'em. And &s;o,</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="9" REF="003262_0011_0FF02ED809E61E60">
4. A Spirit of <HI>Peace and Love,</HI> Meekne&s;s and Hu|mility, Candour and Gentlene&s;s; whereby Per&s;ons are ready to unite their Coun&s;els, and act in Concert with one another; paying a ju&s;t Deference one to another and preferring one another in Honour; glad to receive Light from any one, and well plea&s;ed to reflect it from them; all pur&s;uing one End, as the many Pillars in a great Hou&s;e &s;tand quietly near to one another, and all help to bear it up: This <HI>Spirit of Power, and of Love, and of a &s;ound Mind,</HI> render men &s;trong and beautiful <HI>Pillars</HI> of the Earth.

The <HI>un&s;table</HI> are as <HI>Water,</HI> and more fitly likened to the <HI>Waves of the Sea,</HI> then to a Pillar on Shore.

<HEAD>III. <HI>GOD hath &s;et the World</HI> upon the Govern|ments and Rulers, whom He has made the Pillars of it.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>natural</HI> World is in the Hand of GOD, and is upheld in it's Being and Order by his Power. The <HI>moral</HI> World is mo&s;t upon his Heart, and govern'd in a Way and Manner &s;uted to the Nature and pre&s;ent
<PB N="12" REF="003262_0014_0FF02EE322EDA298">
State of Man. And as He governs the <HI>Spirits</HI> of Men when He plea&s;es by immediate Impre&s;&s;ions on them; &s;o as more proper to the pre&s;ent Order and Happine&s;s of Mankind, He has appointed the Govern|ment of Men to be by Men. So the Peace, Tranqui|lity and Flouri&s;hing of Places are made to depend on the Wi&s;dom and Fidelity of their Rulers, in the good Admini&s;tration of the Government. While the utmo&s;t Mi&s;ery and Confu&s;ion befals tho&s;e Places where the Go|vernment is ill admini&s;tred. The Rea&s;on is given in the <HI>Text, "GOD has &s;et the World</HI> on this Foot; it can't &s;tand on any other Bottom. 'The Virtue and Religion of a People, their Riches and Trade, their Power, Honour and Reputation; and the Favour of GOD toward them, with his Ble&s;&s;ing on them; do greatly depend on the pious, righteous and faithful Go|vernment which they are under.</P>
<P><HI>GOD hath &s;et:</HI> As well in the Nature of Things, as in his Word. <HI>Government</HI> is not a Creature of Man's Lu&s;t and Will, but of Divine Con&s;titution, and from a Nece&s;&s;ity in the Nature of things. The very Being and Weal of <HI>Society</HI> depends thereon.</P>
<P><HI>Government</HI> was not in the Original of it a&s;&s;umed or u&s;urped by any one Man. For In&s;tance, Not by <HI>Lamech</HI> before the Flood, nor by <HI>Nimrod</HI> after it. In|deed the Spirit of <HI>Tyranny,</HI> and the <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> of Dominion, &s;eem to have began in them; but <HI>Order &amp; Rule</HI> was before them. Mankind naturally went into <HI>That,</HI> and <HI>The&s;e</HI> were the Men who made the fir&s;t Breaches on it; the One being of the Race of <HI>Cain,</HI> the other of <HI>Ham;</HI> who have had &s;ome of their Likene&s;s in every Place, and thro' all Generations; that would turn the World up&s;ide down, and overthrow the Foundations which GOD has laid.</P>
<P>In a word, <HI>Magi&s;tracy,</HI> like the other Ordinances of Heaven, &s;tands by the Power and Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD; who effectually owns it and works by it, e&s;tabli&s;hes the Earth and it abideth. He has graven it deep in he Hearts of Men, even as the De&s;ire of Happine&s;s and

Self-pre&s;ervation. He has as much ordained, that while the Earth remaineth <HI>Civil Order</HI> and Government &s;hall not cea&s;e; as He had &s;worn <HI>that Seed Time and Har|ve&s;t, Cold and Heat, Summer and Winter, Day and Night,</HI> &s;hall not.

<HEAD><HI>USE.</HI> I &s;hall now make a few <HI>Reflections,</HI> by way of practical Inference and <HI>Improvement.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. See the Divine Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s in Ordain|ing and E&s;tabli&s;hing a Magi&s;tracy and Government in the World. It is one of the many great In&s;tances, where|in the SUPREAM GOVERNOUR of the World has taken Care for the univer&s;al and perpetual Weal of it. And they that would be lawle&s;s and ungoverned, de&s;pi&s;ing Dominion and &s;peaking Evil of Dignity, Di&s;tinction, Authority and Rule among Men, act as madly and mi&s;|chievou&s;ly as one would do, that &s;hould go into a Hou&s;e and &s;ap the Foundation of it, till it fall upon him and cru&s;h him to Death.</P>
<P>It is one evident Mark of the <HI>Romi&s;h Impo&s;ture,</HI> and of the Spirit of <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> that it has invaded, u&s;urp'd upon and &s;ubverted the Authority of Kings and Princes, Governments and States, over their Subjects. The <HI>Popes</HI> Claim of Supremacy transfers the Allegiance of Subjects to a foreign Power, and ab&s;olves 'em from their Oaths. This alone is a &s;ufficient Mark of the <HI>Bea&s;t</HI> and of the <HI>Man of Sin.</HI> What Confu&s;ion and Vexation has the World &s;uffered from this in&s;olent &amp; mon&s;trous Doctrine! And how &s;trange is it that &s;o many Kingdoms and Na|tions of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hould &s;o long wander after it, to their infinite Mi&s;rule &amp; Di&s;traction! But the Word &amp; dread|ful Judgment of GOD mu&s;t be fulfilled on a wicked World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reformed Churches</HI> took early Care to <HI>prote&s;t</HI> again&s;t this Doctrine of Devils. They declared for a "con&s;cientious Subjection and Obedience to the Laws and Magi&s;trates under which they liv'd, and by whom they were protected &amp; defended in their ju&s;t Rights and Liberties.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="003262_0016_0FF02EE7DEB1A2B0">
<Q>Every Kind of Magi&s;tracy (&s;ay the <HI>Helvetian Chur|ches</HI>) is in&s;tituted by GOD, for the Peace and Hap|pine&s;s of Man, and all Subjects &s;hould own the Good|ne&s;s of GOD in the In&s;titution of a Magi&s;trate, by honouring Him as <HI>the Mini&s;ter of GOD.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the ju&s;t and true Principles of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion,</HI> according to the <HI>Oracles</HI> of GOD in this Matter: Rom. xiii. 1,&mdash;5. <HI>Let every Soul be &s;ubject unto the higher Powers: For there is no Power but of GOD; the Powers that be are ordained of GOD: Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the Power, re&s;i&s;t|eth the Ordinance of GOD.&mdash;Wherefore ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for Wrath</HI> (or fear of Puni&s;hment) <HI>but al&s;o for Con&s;cience &s;ake. Render therefore unto all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Cu&s;tom to whom Cu&s;tom, Fear to whom Fear, and Honour to whom Honour.</HI> Tit. iii. 1. <HI>Put them in mind to be &s;ubject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Magi&s;trates.</HI> 1 Pet. ii. 13, 14, 15, 16, 16, 17. <HI>Submit your &s;elves to every Or|dinance of Man for the</HI> LORD's <HI>&s;ake; whether it be to the King as &s;upream, or unto Governours as unto them that are &s;ent by Him: For &s;o is the Will of GOD.</HI> Let us very gratefully ob&s;erve the&s;e Precepts, for they are very graciou&s;ly given us for the Good of the World.</P>
<P N="2">2. Are Magi&s;trates the Pillars of the Earth? Are they the LORD's? and has He &s;et the World upon them? Let us then devoutly ob&s;erve the Governing Providence of GOD in di&s;po&s;ing of Per&s;ons and Offices, both with re&s;pect unto our Selves and Others.</P>
<P>As to <HI>our Selves,</HI> let GOD lead, and Providence open our Way, and let us follow humbly &amp; obediently. Let us think &s;oberly of our &s;elves, and not vainly pine after Honour and Power, or wickedly pu&s;h for it like <HI>Ab&s;a|lom.</HI> But neither need we hide our &s;elves like <HI>Saul,</HI> when the Divine Call is plain, nor in&s;i&s;t on Excu&s;es like the meek and accompli&s;hed <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> Or if again Provi|dence lays us by, why &s;hould we not retire with <HI>Samu|el's</HI> Humility and Greatne&s;s of Soul.</P>
<P>And then as to <HI>Others,</HI> Let us not think our &s;elves neglected or overlook'd, be envious and di&s;content, if GOD prefer them. Suffer the MOST HIGH to rule in the Kingdoms of Men, and to give the Provinces that belong
<PB N="15" REF="003262_0017_0FF02EED6F4597D0">
to 'em to whom&s;oever He will. Let us know and keep our own Place, and do our Duty to Tho&s;e whom GOD &s;ets over us.</P>
<P>Let People reverence &amp; honour their worthy Rulers, and let the Highe&s;t among Men be very humble before GOD. They are <HI>Pillars,</HI> but of the <HI>Earth.</HI> The Earth and its Pillars are di&s;&s;olving together. <HI>Government</HI> abides, in a Succe&s;&s;ion of Men, while the Earth endures, but the <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> however good &amp; great, mu&s;t die like other Men. We mu&s;t not look too much at the Lofti|ne&s;s of any, nor lean too much on any earthly Pillar: <HI>Put not your Tru&s;t in Princes, nor in the Son of Man in whom there is no Help: His Breath goeth forth, he returneth to his Du&s;t.</HI> Nor may the Highe&s;t among Mortals behold them&s;elves with Elation &amp; Security, as the vain King of <HI>Babylon</HI> once; but let them fear and tremble before the GOD <HI>of Heaven,</HI> who inherits all Nations, and &s;tands in the Congregation of the Mighty, and judgeth among the <HI>Gods.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Are Rulers the Pillars of the Earth; are They the LORD's? and has He &s;et the World upon 'em? Let all that are in Public Offices con&s;ider their Obligation<HI>s</HI> to be PILLARS, in the Places wherein Providence hath &s;et 'em.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Rulers</HI> con&s;ider what they owe to GOD, who has rear'd and &s;et 'em up; and to the <HI>Publick</HI> which GOD has &s;et upon them. Let 'em &s;eek Wi&s;dom &amp; Strength, Grace and Conduct from GOD, that they may an&s;wer the <HI>Title</HI> given 'em in my <HI>Text.</HI> Let 'em <HI>&s;tand,</HI> and <HI>bear,</HI> and <HI>act</HI> for GOD; who&s;e they are, and who has &s;et 'em where they are. Let the publick Good be their ju&s;t Care; that it may be &s;een that GOD has &s;et the World in their <HI>Heart,</HI> as well as laid it on their <HI>Shoulders.</HI> Let 'em act uprightly, that they may &s;tand &s;ecure and &s;trong. Let 'em fear GOD, and rule by his Word, that they may be approved by GOD, and accepted always by Men with all Thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>As <HI>Government</HI> is the Pillar of the Earth, &s;o <HI>Religion</HI> is the Pillar of Government. Take away the Fear of GOD's Government &amp; Judgment, and humane Rule utterly falls, or corrupts into Tyranny. But if Religion rule in the Hearts and Lives of Rulers, GOD will have Glory, and the People be made happy.</P>

<P>CHRIST will erect a <HI>Monumental Pillar,</HI> that &s;hall &s;tand for ever, in Honour of all <HI>Them</HI> who in their Sta|tion here, be they high or low, faithfully endeavour to uphold His Church and Kingdom.</P>
<P>It is a <HI>triumphant Promi&s;e</HI> taken from the <HI>Roman</HI> manner of Pillars rear'd to the Memory of Illu&s;trious Per|&s;ons and PATRIOTS, on which were in&s;crib'd their <HI>Names</HI> and worthy Deeds; together with that of the Empire, City or Province, which they were &s;o happy as to &s;erve and help to &s;ave.</P>
<P>Infinitely more Glory and Honour &s;hall be done to Him who &s;erves the <HI>Lord CHRIST,</HI> his Kingdom, People and Intere&s;t, in his Life here on Earth: When he comes into his Temple above he &s;hall have a <HI>Pillar of Cele&s;tial Glory</HI> rear'd to eternize his Name; And on it &s;hall be written (O Divine Honour!) "THIS WAS A FAITHFUL SERVANT OF HIS GOD, AND SAVIOUR, AND OF THE CHURCH ON EARTH.</P>
<P>There let Him &s;tand for ever, <HI>"A Monument of free Grace, never to be defaced or removed."</HI> While the Names of famous <HI>Emperors, Kings</HI> and <HI>Generals,</HI> graven in Bra&s;s or cut in Marble, on &s;tately <HI>Pillars</HI> and tri|umphant <HI>Arches,</HI> &s;hall moulder into Du&s;t.</P>
