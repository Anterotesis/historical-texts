<LG>
<L>YE rightful &s;overeigns of a fertile &s;oil,</L>
<L>Where copious plenty pays the laborer's toil;</L>
<L>Where growing commerce freights each flowing tide.</L>
<L>With CERES' <HI>bounty,</HI> and with NEPTUNE'S <HI>pride:</HI></L>
<L>Since your brave fires their &s;avage inmates cru&s;h'd,</L>
<L>The toc&s;in &s;ilenc'd, and the war-whoop hu&s;h'd;</L>
<L>The ho&s;tile canva&s;s le&s;s'ning from your &s;hore,</L>
<L>The la&s;t remains of cur&s;t inva&s;ion bore;</L>
<L>Dead be the mem'ry of a noble foe;</L>
<L>Where bled the hero, let the olive grow.</L>
<L>Let dove-eyed peace &s;ucceed to war's alarms,</L>
<L>Bid &s;avage rancor ru&s;t on u&s;ele&s;s arms;</L>
<L>Her ample&s;t boon to mode&s;t merit give,</L>
<L>And guard tho&s;e arts by which your glories live.</L>
<L>Your approbation's &s;miles let genius &s;hare;</L>
<L>From chilling fro&s;ts its budding blo&s;&s;oms &s;pare.</L>
<L>Let not the panders of your taste oppo&s;&eacute;</L>
<L>The foreign bramble, to the native ro&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With nothing higher than a noble aim,</L>
<L>Your CANDOR'S all the author dares to claim.</L>
<L>Untaught by rules, he makes his guide the heart,</L>
<L>And mode&s;t nature deems the pride of art.</L>
<L>No tragic tale from hi&s;t'ry forms his plan;</L>
<L>His facts are pa&s;&s;ions, and their hi&s;t'ry, man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While in the court the &s;upple pander &s;hines,</L>
<L>And cheerle&s;s virtue in the dungeon pines;</L>
<L>The elder world's di&s;a&s;ters ri&s;e to view,</L>
<L>To foil the &s;tubborn virtues of the new:</L>
<L>While the&s;e in contra&s;t on the &s;tage appear;</L>
<L>There the proud de&s;pot&mdash;the firm patriot here;</L>
<L>That rob'd in power&mdash;this, arm'd with nature's laws;&mdash;</L>
<L>From &s;cenes like the&s;e, the bard his moral draws.&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O, learn, Columbia's &s;ons, to prize your land,</L>
<L>Where no bold tyrant dares to lift his hand;</L>
<L>Where rules a chief, who&s;e power is all your own,</L>
<L>Virtue, his &s;ceptre&mdash;and the laws, his throne;</L>
<L>Where, <HI>to obey</HI>&mdash;is every freeman's pride,</L>
<L>And, <HI>to rebel</HI>&mdash;were wor&s;e than &s;uicide!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To captious critics, vers'd in &s;cenic laws,</L>
<L>He dares not tru&s;t the merits of his cau&s;e.</L>
<L>View then, ye lib'ral, with a candid eye,</L>
<L>Kill not the bird, that fir&s;t attempts to fly,</L>
<L>But aid his efforts with parental care,</L>
<L>'Till his weak pinions learn to ply the air,</L>
<L>'Till the young pupil dare aloft to ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And &s;oar, with bolder flights, his native &s;kies.</L>

<L>But &s;top&mdash;to look around me, will be right;&mdash;</L>
<L>Upon my word, a very pretty &s;ight!</L>
<L>Where young, and old, in motley mixture &s;it,</L>
<L>And grave, and gay, in Gallery, Box, and Pit;</L>
<L>Where well dre&s;&s;ed lads di&s;play the frizeur's power,</L>
<L>And wigs, far whiter than the cauliflower!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What youth is that, &s;o talkative and loud,</L>
<L>That thru&s;ts his pretty face from out the crowd?</L>
<L>From Julien's are you, Sir?&mdash;I know your forte;</L>
<L>Eat &s;oup&mdash;play high&mdash;cry <HI>"that's your &s;ort!"</HI></L>
<L>To prove your courage, &s;wear away, like thunder,</L>
<L>While friends admire and &s;trangers &s;tare with wonder!</L>
<L>Ride out to Bird's, and play at bowls o' Sunday,</L>
<L>And &s;wear it is not wor&s;e than on a Monday.</L>
<L>Mo&s;t freely I acknowledge, Sir, your merit,</L>
<L>And when you've drank your <HI>grog,</HI> I grant you don't want <HI>&s;pirit!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, who are you, far graver than phy&s;ician?</L>
<L>I know you, now, Sir;&mdash;you're a&mdash;politician!&mdash;</L>
<L>" Great news"&mdash;O, what?&mdash;The French have not received</L>
<L>" Our Envoys; is the &s;tory, Sir, believed&mdash;</L>
<L>" O, &s;ir, 'tis true; as friends, they'll never greet ye,</L>
<L>" Unle&s;s you break that cur&s;ed Briti&s;h Treaty!</L>
<L>" Allowed to arm, too! &s;ir, th' admini&s;tration,</L>
<L>" Unle&s;s re&s;i&s;ted, will undo the nation!&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I &s;ee, &s;ir, you're a Jacobin&mdash;"No, in reality</L>
<L>I'm a true friend to Liberty and Equality!</L>

" And tho' of French Directors, 'tis the creed;</L>
<L>" That we, poor <HI>Yankees</HI> are of <HI>&s;paniel</HI> breed;</L>
<L>" Yet, will our <HI>ma&s;ters</HI> kindly loo&s;e our collars,</L>
<L>" If paid the <HI>"dog tax"</HI> of twelve million dollars!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Take my advi&s;e, Sirs, and this non&s;en&s;e drop;</L>
<L>Re&s;ume your yard-&s;tick, and attend your &s;hop!&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In yonder box, I &s;ee a charming maid;&mdash;</L>
<L>Not you, Mi&s;s Pert, who to&s;s &s;o high your head:</L>
<L>Whil&s;t manners, ta&s;te, and &s;en&s;e, and &s;weetne&s;s vie,</L>
<L>To aid the keen de&s;truction of her eye,</L>
<L>What pity &s;he &s;hould un&s;tring Cupid's fell-bow,</L>
<L>By &s;howing the <HI>bare bones</HI> of either elbow.</L>
<L>Hide then, O, bide the far too naked arm,</L>
<L>For mode&s;t beauty gives a double charm!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such are the trivial faults, ab&s;orbed and lo&s;t,</L>
<L>Amid the blaze of virtues, that you boa&s;t;</L>
<L>If then you will receive this &s;light e&s;&s;ay,</L>
<L>By way of Epilogue, to this our Play;</L>
<L>If what I've &s;aid will pa&s;s in&s;tead of wit,</L>
<L>Your hands applaud me, and your hearts acquit!</L>
