<P>THE occa&s;ion of <HI>publi&s;hing</HI> the following <HI>farewell</HI> Sermon, was the repeated impor|tunity of a number of my late pari&s;hioners who heard it. But as to the particular occa&s;ion of its being <HI>preached,</HI> and the very peculiar &s;itua|tion of affairs in &s;aid pari&s;h, at that time, and the &s;pecial circum&s;tances attending the &s;ame, I for|bear to enter into a relation thereof; lea&s;t it &s;hould &s;eem to carry in it, &s;ome reflections on tho&s;e who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the more immedi|ate in&s;truments of my removal from that people; which I would carefully avoid, as I al&s;o have in the following Sermon; and would earne&s;tly advi&s;e my late adherents to do likewi&s;e: for I am exceeding de&s;irous that all tho&s;e things that have the lea&s;t tendency to irretate the minds of any, &s;hould be laid a&s;ide and buried in oblivion; and that every one would put on that "fervent charity" towards each other, which "covers a multitude of Sins." So, beg|ging the candor of all who may read the fol|lowing Di&s;cour&s;e, and praying that the divine ble&s;&s;ing may accompany it, e&s;pecially to that people who have been my late charge, I abide your &s;incere friend and &s;ouls well-wi&s;her,</P>

CHRIST, to the people committed to their charge, and how de&s;irous to leave GOD with them, when they them&s;elves are departing from them.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE I have cho&s;en the&s;e words of the Apo&s;tle to vent the love of a <HI>friend,</HI> and the heart of a <HI>Pa&s;tor,</HI> in taking my final <HI>fare|well</HI> of you, who have been, &s;o long, the be|loved people of my charge&mdash;'Finally, bre|thren, <HI>farewell</HI>; be perfect, be of good com|fort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the GOD of love and peace &s;hall be with you.' And truly I do not know how, in fewer and more comprehen&s;ive words, to expre&s;s my ar|dent de&s;ire of your &s;piritual welfare, than by adpoting a &s;imilar language with the Apo&s;tle in my text in my <HI>la&s;t addre&s;s</HI> to you, 'Be perfect.' i. e. See that you are united to JESUS CHRIST by faith, and knit together, one to another by love and charity: This is go&s;pel perfection. Then, 'Be of good comfort,' even rejoice in tribulation which befals you in the way of duty. 'Be of one mind,' of the &s;ame judg|ment, if po&s;&s;ible, in all things. However, if this cannot be attained, yet be of <HI>one heart.</HI> 'Live in peace.' Let not difference in judg|ment cau&s;e difference in affection. If in &s;ome le&s;&s;er things your heads be different, yet let your hearts be one: And for your en|couragement to hearken to this coun&s;el, be a&s;|&s;ured that 'the GOD of love and peace will be with you;' even that GOD who is the au|thor of peace, the worker of peace, and the
<PB N="7" REF="011687_0006_0F87EC905C8DD080">
lover of peace and concord: the heart of GOD will be with &s;uch, the help of GOD and the pre&s;ence of GOD: He will dwell with them here, that love and live in peace, and they &s;hall &s;hortly dwell with him in his glorious pre&s;ence hereafter forever.</P>
<P>THUS you have briefly heard what is im|plied in the Apo&s;tle's validiction and affec|tionate <HI>farewell</HI> to his beloved Corinthians, and in what manner I de&s;ire to take my leave of you al&s;o, to whom I have &s;o long &s;tood in a pa&s;toral relation, now immediately to be di&s;|&s;olved. And I have the rather cho&s;en the&s;e as my <HI>parting words,</HI> becau&s;e, (as to &s;ome of you) 'I perceive &s;orrow hath filled your hearts,' upon this melancholly occa&s;ion. Therefore I would be glad to guide you to the fountain head of all con&s;olation, even to 'the GOD of love and peace,' and to JESUS CHRIST 'the prince of peace,' and 'the con&s;olation of I&s;rael,' and to the 'Spirit of truth,' who is the 'comforter of them that are ca&s;t down,' and are 'mourners in Zion.'</P>
<P>BUT perhaps &s;ome of you may be ready to rai&s;e &s;ome objections in your own minds, which, (as my de&s;ign is to be very practical in handling the &s;ubject) I would endeavour to obviate; e&s;pecially as I may hereby as ful|ly open and explain the &s;cope and meaning of the text, as in any other method.</P>
<P>SOME then, may be ready to &s;ay, within

them&s;elves, That, 'if in the conclu&s;ion of your Mini&s;try among us, and in your parting advice to us, you &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon our com|pliance with the&s;e comprehen&s;ive exhortati|ons, contained in the text, that you will, here|in, not only put us upon improbabilities, but upon impo&s;&s;ibilities under our pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances. For (fir&s;t) <HI>perfection</HI> is not attainable in this life. Nor (&s;econdly) is it po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be of good comfort under our pre&s;ent unhappy, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and broken circum&s;tan|ces, in this place; being deprived of our Pa&s;|tor, and in all probibility of ever more enjoying go&s;pel ordinances among us. Nor (thirdly) can it be expected that we &s;hould ever be all 'of one mind' and judgment in every thing, in &s;uch an im|perfect &s;tate as this; much le&s;s under our divided circum&s;tances; and that there is little or no hopes of our being ever &s;o well reconciled to one another's way of thinking, who are now &s;o wide in our opinions and &s;entiments. And therefore (fourthly) there is no hopes of our 'living in peace' among our &s;elves, and &s;o of the 'GOD of love and peace' being with us.</P>
<P>I SAY, the&s;e are the objections, my hearers, which &s;ome of you may be under a temptati|on to make again&s;t my pre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e patheti|cal exhortations upon you, urged in my text; e&s;pecially in your pre&s;ent frame of mind, pro|duced by your grievous afflictions: and may be provok'd to &s;ay, It is in vain to tell of the&s;e things; e&s;pecially of 'living in peace' with
<PB N="9" REF="011687_0008_0F87EC91DC8F5B08">
&s;ome of our brethren and neighbours; for we can never get over what we have met with, during life.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE I &s;hall now endeavour to make an&s;wer to the&s;e your objections, and &s;hew you that the things mentioned in the text, are po&s;&s;ible, and what may be attained, by the help of divine grace, even in this im|perfect &s;tate, and under your pre&s;ent di&s;ad|vantageous circum&s;tances, in the &s;en&s;e of the Apo&s;tle. As,</P>
<P N="1">I. WITH regard to the exhortation, <HI>Be perfect.</HI> This may be attained, in the &s;en&s;e of the text, by getting united to CHRIST by faith, and &s;o clothed with his <HI>perfect</HI> righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and then you will be <HI>perfectly</HI> ju&s;tified: And by getting knit to one another in love and charity, which is the 'bond of perfect|ne&s;s,' and &s;anctifyed throughout, in &s;oul, bo|dy, and &s;pirit. Your &s;anctification will be <HI>perfect</HI> as to parts, though defective as to de|grees, when your hearts are '&s;ound in GOD's &s;tatutes,' and you 'have re&s;pect to all' his 'commandments,' and 'hate every fal&s;e way: When the mark you aim at and pur&s;ue, is the highe&s;t degree of <HI>perfection,</HI> with the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI>; and to be 'perfect as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect,' according to our Sa|viour's direction. This is to be <HI>perfect</HI> in a &s;cripture &s;en&s;e; which is attainable in this life. This is evangelical or go&s;pel-perfection, con&s;i&s;ting in a &s;tate of ju&s;tification by faith,
<PB N="10" REF="011687_0009_0F87EC929C8CDA68">
and a &s;pirit that hath no allowed guile. For there is a proportion between &s;uch a heart and GOD's commands: No other heart can reach every commandment; and without this integrity and uprightne&s;s of heart, we do nothing to purpo&s;e in religion. But where there is this &s;oundne&s;s, &s;implicity, and &s;ingle|ne&s;s of heart, GOD has, in a mea&s;ure, what he calls for, even the whole heart; and &s;uch an one with <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> will 'follow the LORD fully;' making up &s;wervings, repair|ing breaches in his heart, and every day la|bouring that it may be perfect with GOD. The&s;e are, in &s;cripture called 'perfect and up|right,' as <HI>Abraham, Job,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THEREFORE never &s;ay that it is impo&s;&s;ible to attain what the Apo&s;tle enjoins in the fir&s;t part of his val<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">dictory exhortation, 'Be per|fect.' And therefore,</P>
<P N="2">II. 'BE of good comfort.' Now if we have attained to the former duty, we may ea&s;ily arrive to the enjoyment of this priviledge, for that will lay a good foundation for it. And &s;urely this may be enjoyed by Chri&s;tians in this world, and that, even under the mo&s;t un|comfortable circum&s;tances of life. The Apo|&s;tles and primitive Chri&s;tians attained to it, who were '&s;orrowful, yet always rejoicing:' Yea, they were 'exceeding joyful in all their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">lations;' and well they might, while &s;uf|fering for CHRIST, in that they had the 'Spirit of GOD and of glory re&s;ting upon them.'</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="011687_0010_0F87EC935C8FBCB0">BUT perhaps you may be ready to &s;ay, this is the harde&s;t duty of all, and even impo&s;&s;i|ble to comply with under your pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances, when you are deprived of go&s;pel ordi|nances, and are never like to enjoy them more in a &s;tated way; where can we look for con&s;olation, when our <HI>Barnaba&s;es</HI> are removed from us, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>?</P>
<P>To which I reply,&mdash;Then is your time to look out for it, then is your time to expect the fulfilment of that gracious promi&s;e of our Sa|viour, <HI>John</HI> xiv.16, 17. 'I will pray the Fa|ther and he &s;hall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever, even the Spirit of truth.' Ob&s;erve, our Saviour was at this time, ju&s;t taking his leave of his di&s;ci|ples, and departing from them as to his bodily pre&s;ence; and they were almo&s;t overwhelmed with &s;orrow upon this occa&s;ion; wherefore the compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour, after lovingly chiding their inordinate grief hereupon, &s;aying, 'Let not your hearts be troubled,' he adds the words before cited, as an antidote again&s;t their being exce&s;&s;ively troubled upon this account, namely, 'I will pray the Father, and he &s;hall give you another comforter. And v.18, 'I will not leave you comfortle&s;s:' As if he had &s;aid, Although I cannot abide always with you my|&s;elf in per&s;on, nor by my <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> yet I will &s;end the HOLY GHOST to abide with you forever, who&s;e proper work and office it is, to comfort the di&s;con&s;olate and them that are ca&s;t down. Our LORD JESUS CHRIST
<PB N="12" REF="011687_0011_0F87EC941C8A2318">
hereby &s;ignifies, that his people &s;hould not think them&s;elves undone when he withdraws the ex|ternal &s;ymbols of his pre&s;ence from them, his mini&s;ters and ordinances; as if, when the&s;e were gone, <HI>all</HI> mu&s;t be inevitably gone&mdash;no, no, if all creature comforts, and even religious advantages too, as to externals, are gone, yet &s;o long as GOD and CHRIST and the Spi|rit live and abide with GOD's people, they cannot want for grounds of comfort.</P>
<P>INDEED the comfort of ordinances is &s;weet, and Sermons are &s;weet when GOD is in them; but are not the comforts of the Spirit &s;weet al&s;o, when enjoyed without them? Where|fore, O children of GOD, you may 'be of good comfort,' if it is not your own fault, under what&s;oever &s;ad providences befall you, or your families, your Mini&s;ters or the church of GOD. 'In the multitude of your thoughts within you,' his 'comforts may delight your &s;ouls, <HI>P&s;a.</HI> xciv.19. 'Therefore be of good comfort'&mdash;for when you have trouble without, you may have peace within. See to it that you do not grieve the Spirit, your divine com|forter; and then, though earthly comforts are fled, and even tho&s;e ordinances, through which divine con&s;olations u&s;ed to be conveyed to your &s;ouls are removed, yet ha&s;ten to the Fa|ther in the name of his Son JESUS CHRIST, and plead with him to &s;end you relief in this way, according to his promi&s;e. Yea, plead with your Saviour, under tho&s;e gloomy cir|cum&s;tances, that he would do that for you in Heaven, which he promi&s;ed when on earth,
<PB N="13" REF="011687_0012_0F87EC94DC8F7A48">
even, 'pray the Father, that he would &s;end the comforter' into your hearts. Thus lay up your comforts, not in creatures, but in CHRIST him&s;elf, even in his &s;piritual pre|&s;ence: For if he can comfort, his people with|out his bodily pre&s;ence, (as we have heard) then &s;urely he can do it in the want of all out|ward means, and con&s;equently, without his Mi|ni&s;ters, or external ordinances. As it is the Spirit of GOD alone that can comfort in the u&s;e of the&s;e means, &s;o he can do it in the want of them. He can comfort in the wilderne&s;s, in 'a land of drought where no water is.' Where he denies us the &s;treams, he can make us drink of the fountain: Yea, the&s;e comforts which we have &s;o from the fir&s;t hand, are abid|ing comforts; whereas, what comes by &s;econd hand or mediately, are, like tho&s;e means them|&s;elves, not abiding. Ordinances and <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> may be taken from you, either by death or otherwi&s;e; but here are comforts that abide forever. Therefore 'let not your hearts be troubled,' but 'be of good comfort;' for though in&s;truments may, when GOD permits, keep your Mini&s;ters out of the pulpit, yet none can keep the comforter out of your &s;ouls, and who is he that 'can harm you,' while 'ye be followers of that which is good.' Now as to the</P>
<P N="3">IIId thing: 'Be of one mind.' This is al&s;o attainable, in the &s;en&s;e of my text; which im|plies an agreement in all e&s;&s;ential things, and in the fundamental points of religion; and as
<PB N="14" REF="011687_0013_0F87EC959CCE38C8">
to tho&s;e of le&s;s importance, and things indif|ferent in them&s;elves, &s;urely difference in opi|nion, need to breed no alienation in affection, or bitter di&s;&s;entions and divi&s;ions. Wherefore, not to enlarge here, I pa&s;s to the</P>
<P N="4">IVth thing mentioned, 'Live in peace:' That is, live no longer in &s;trife, contention, and wrath, but let all &s;chi&s;ms and breaches be healed among you, and good agreement take place. The Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Rom.</HI> xii.18. 'If it be po&s;&s;ible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men,' Hence it is our du|ty always to endeavour, and it is doubtle&s;s po&s;|&s;ible to live in &s;ome degree of peace, with all, even the wor&s;t of men, if it is not our own fault. And methinks the con&s;ideration of GOD's readine&s;s to be reconciled to us, even when in a &s;tate of enmity with him, &s;hould be|get in us a placable and reconcileable di&s;po&s;iti|on towards tho&s;e that are enemies to us, even towards &s;uch as remain of an implacable tem|per towards us, &s;o as to harbour no malevo|lent or unchri&s;tian re&s;entments again&s;t them, but from our hearts to forgive them in that re|&s;pect, and to wi&s;h and &s;eek their be&s;t good and welfare both of &s;oul and body; and when we are brought to &s;uch a temper as this, not in|dulging any &s;pleen, bitterne&s;s, or ill-will, but are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition to|wards them, we do &s;o far 'live in peace;' be|ing at peace with GOD and having a peace|able frame and di&s;po&s;ition of heart towards all men: And then may we claim and expect the
<PB N="15" REF="011687_0014_0F87EC965C8711F0">
benefit of that gracious promi&s;e, <HI>Prov.</HI> xvi.7. 'When a man's ways plea&s;e the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him;' that is, GOD ordinarily will, in &s;uch ca&s;es, &s;o mercifully lay his re&s;traints upon our mo&s;t bitter enemies, as that they &s;hall not be &s;uffered greatly to harm us, when we our&s;elves are, in this re&s;pect, 'followers of that which is good.' And in this way it is, that we may overcome evil with good, at lea&s;t &s;o as to &s;e|cure our&s;elves from the <HI>mi&s;chief,</HI> if we cannot from the <HI>re&s;entment</HI> of our enemies. Where|fore, &s;ay not, it is impo&s;&s;ible for you, under your pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, to comply with this part of the exhortation, 'live in peace;' &s;ince there is no circum&s;tance or condition you can be in, here in this world, but, if your hearts are right with GOD and your neighbour, you may enjoy peace with GOD, peace in your own brea&s;ts, and po&s;&s;e&s;s a peaceable di&s;po&s;ition to|ward all men, even your wor&s;t and bittere&s;t enemies. If they will contend with you, the blame will not lie at your door, nor is it nece&s;|&s;ary the peace of your own minds &s;hould be di&s;turbed thereby.</P>
<P>I GRANT indeed, it is no ea&s;y matter, in &s;uch an imperfect &s;tate as this is, and under very trying circum&s;tances, to attain to &s;uch a degree of grace, and &s;uch &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s of faith and charity, as to &s;tand our ground again&s;t &s;uch &s;trong temptations, as we are liable to; yet it may be attained, and has been attained, and is what we ought earne&s;tly to &s;eek and endea|vour
<PB N="16" REF="011687_0015_0F87EC971C863348">
after: And in attaining &s;uch a frame of mind as this, we &s;hall reap the pre&s;ent comfort and benefit of it, as well as the future rewards of grace; for in the very 'keeping of' this 'command, there is a great reward.'</P>
<P>THEREFORE be per&s;waded to 'live in peace', by being &s;o far from giving any ju&s;t cau&s;e or grounds of &s;tumbling to any, as to remove all &s;uch occa&s;ions out of the way of &s;uch as would &s;eek occa&s;ion. Yea, endeavour not only to 'leave off contention before it be meddled with,' 'but u&s;e your be&s;t' your utmo&s;t endea|vours to make up differences and heal divi&s;ions where they have ri&s;en, and you &s;hall thereby obtain the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of 'peace-makers', and be honoured with being 'called the children of GOD.' Thus &s;ee that you 'live in peace' putting up injuries, forgiving offences, as you expect that GOD for CHRIST &s;ake will for|give you.' Say not that your brethren and neighbours have done you &s;uch un&s;peakable wrongs, and offered you &s;uch abu&s;es, that you can never put them up, and do not think you are required in duty to do it &mdash;I pray you to con&s;ider what wrongs, what injuries have you been guilty of again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed GOD! Yea, what indignities, high handed offences, and affronts have been offered to the infinite Ma|je&s;ty of Heaven! Can you imagine the wrongs and abu&s;es you have received from men, your fellow creatures, can be comparable with tho&s;e you have offered to GOD your Creator, and to JESUS CHRIST your Redeemer? And yet
<PB N="17" REF="011687_0016_0F87EC97DC839750">
do not you hope to obtain forgivene&s;s from GOD? But what grounds have you for the&s;e hopes, if you do not forgive men their tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es? Our Saviour &s;ays expre&s;sly, <HI>Matt.</HI> xiv.15. 'If ye forgive men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, your heavenly Father will forgive you, but if ye forgive not men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.' Comfortable words indeed to the reconcileable in &s;pirit; but awful words to them that are of an implacable and unforgiving &s;pirit, and harbour malice in their hearts.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps &s;ome may &s;ay, 'I know I ought to forgive, upon repentance and chri&s;|tian &s;atisfaction, and hope I &s;tand ready to do it; but do not think I am obliged to do it without; nay I think I ought not.' To which I reply,&mdash;It may be granted that you are not obliged to forgive &s;o fully as to re&s;tore to your chri&s;tian charity, an offender, but upon evidence of his repentance and offered &s;atis|faction; yet you ought &s;o far to forgive, with|out &s;uch manife&s;tation of repentance, as to in|dulge no &s;ecret grudge, ill-will or unchri&s;tian re&s;entment again&s;t your wor&s;t enemies upon earth; yea, &s;o as to wi&s;h and pray for their welfare, that they may be the &s;ubjects of all the good things that they are capable of, and en|deavour to do them all the good that lies in your power, though they de&s;pitefully u&s;e and per&s;ecute you,' <HI>Matt.</HI> v.44.

Thus you may judge &s;omething by the amia|ble and endearing character which is here given of GOD, 'as the GOD of <HI>love</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI>' what an ine&s;timable advantage it will be to have him dwell with you; who in an e&s;pecial man|ner delights in di&s;playing the&s;e attributes of 'love and peace.'

and coun&s;els, as my parting advice, accord|ing to the different ages, conditions and other circum&s;tances you may be in.</P>
<P N="1">I. To the <HI>young people and children</HI> of this flock, who were born, and have hitherto been brought up under my pa&s;toral care and charge.</P>
<P><HI>Dear children and youth,</HI> you have already heard frequent addre&s;&s;es from my mouth, both in the pulpit and out of it, concerning the things which belong to your everla&s;ting peace; what impre&s;&s;ions they have made upon you, GOD and your own con&s;ciences, are the be&s;t witne&s;&s;es. It is an encouraging thought to me, that the LORD JESUS CHRIST has a very tender regard for the lambs of his flock, as well as the &s;heep. This he plainly di&s;covered in &s;aying, '&s;uffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not'&mdash;when &s;ome would fain have kept them from him. Yea, he not only 'gathers the&s;e lambs in his arms,' but 'carries them in his bo&s;om.'&mdash;O! my <HI>dear children and youth,</HI> I mu&s;t repeat to you, in this my la&s;t addre&s;s, what I have always in&s;i&s;ted upon, that you &s;tand in ab&s;olute need or a Saviour as well as others; and it is your duty and intere&s;t to come to JESUS CHRIST, to this great Shep|herd, when under-&s;hepherds are removed from you; come and choo&s;e CHRIST for your di|vine and heavenly Teacher, how your earthly teacher and in&s;tructor is to be taken from you. O! come and 'learn of him, and you &s;hall find re&s;t to your &s;ouls.' Hear what he &s;ays, <HI>Prov.</HI> viii.17. 'I love them that love me, and tho&s;e that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me.' It is only through him, that you guilty &s;inners can have acce&s;s to a holy GOD. But I know you
<PB N="23" REF="011687_0022_0F87EC9C5C7B1B70">
will never be per&s;waded to hearken to this coun&s;el, until you &s;ee and feel your extreme need of JESUS CHRIST; therefore &s;tudy your own &s;inful, guilty, lo&s;t, and peri&s;hing con|dition by nature and practice, that you may &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of, and be per&s;waded to come to him, as an all-&s;ufficient and willing Saviour who 'is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t,' from &s;in and wrath; and to bring to holine&s;s and happine&s;s. 'all that come to GOD by him.' O! remember you have, the mo&s;t of you, been baptized in the &s;acred name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t; which lays you under an obligation to make choice of GOD the Father for your father and the portion of your &s;ouls, GOD the Son for your Saviour, and GOD the Holy Gho&s;t for your &s;anctifier and comforter; and by thus &s;ecuring the all-&s;ufficient GOD, the &s;acred Three for your everla&s;ting portion, you will be happy in this world and the next. But whil&s;t you remain in a chri&s;tle&s;s &s;tate, 'the wrath of GOD abideth on you,' becau&s;e you are 'children of wrath,' and 'GOD' out of CHRIST 'is a con&s;uming fire.' Hence JE|SUS CHRIST alone, is the 'way to the Father' for you as well as others. Let CHRIST therefore be 'precious' to your &s;ouls. Take him for your LORD and Saviour, and re&s;t your &s;ouls upon him for reconciliation, pardon, and peace with GOD.&mdash;And, <HI>dear children,</HI> &s;ee that you are &s;peedy in, repen|tance towards GOD, and faith' in 'our LORD JESUS CHRIST;' now whil&s;t GOD is cal|ling, CHRIST inviting, and the Spirit &s;triving with you.

Should you neglect this pre|&s;ent opportunity, perhaps you may never hear another Sermon, never have another offer of CHRIST and grace. O! trifle not with your &s;ouls; now 'life and death' are &s;et be|fore you, choo&s;e life, in choo&s;ing the way leading thereto. It is a pity that your youth, and the flower of your age &s;hould be wa&s;ted away in &s;ordid plea&s;ures and gratifications, and you be thereby everla&s;tingly deprived of &s;piritual delights. Sure if you make the trial, you will find the plea&s;ures of religion far prefarable to all the delights of &s;en&s;e and &s;in. Remember, <HI>dear children,</HI> and <HI>young people,</HI> the day of ac|count is near, and ha&s;tens on apace, when you will be called to account how you have &s;pent your childhood and youth; for thus &s;aith the LORD,&mdash;'Know then that for all the&s;e things GOD will bring thee into judgment, <HI>Eccl.</HI> xi.9.

Although the ge|nerality of youth take another cour&s;e, yet do you re&s;olve by the grace of GOD to devote your&s;elves to him, and become religious betimes. Is it better to go to Heaven alone, or with few|er and better company, than to go to Hell with a multitude, a world of &s;inners? Con&s;ider, morever, the work of repentance and conver|&s;ion, humanly &s;peaking, is much ea&s;ier, the &s;oon|er you begin: Sin will be le&s;s rooted, Satan not &s;o fortified, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ace not &s;o much &s;lighted, nor the Spirit of GOD &s;o much grieved, nor con&s;ci|ence &s;o much feared and hardened, as when ol|der.

And while you en|deavour to live every day in the fear of GOD, &s;o e&s;pecially keep holy the <HI>Sabbath.</HI> I have &s;ometimes of late been ready to tremble for your &s;akes, dear youth, when I have had a pro|&s;pect of the future &s;ilent Sabbaths that are com|ing on among you; le&s;t whil&s;t you are de&s;ti|tute of the preached word, GOD's holy day &s;hould be profaned by &s;inful neglect, idle talk, impertinent behaviour, or by un&s;uitable un|&s;ea&s;onable vi&s;its, CHRIST JESUS thereby di&s;honoured, and your &s;ouls ruined. O! let me therefore now advi&s;e and exhort, yea, &s;o|lemnly charge you before GOD. to 'remem|ber the Sabbath to keep it holy;' and &s;o to &s;pend every one, as that you may get nearer to GOD thereby. Let none of it be trifled a|way in vanity, but the whole day carefully &s;pent
<PB N="26" REF="011687_0025_0F87EC9E9C75DF98">
in reading, meditation, and prayer, when you cannot regularly attend the preached word. And while you are praying, reading, medita|ting, &amp;c. take heed you do not make a righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e duties&mdash;de&s;pair of &s;aving your|&s;elves hereby, being a&s;&s;ured that all your 'own righteou&s;ne&s;s' are but 'filthy rags' Yet in this way it is your duty to wait upon GOD to in|tere&s;t you in CHRIST, and give you a ju&s;ti|fying righteou&s;ne&s;s in him, as well as &s;anctify|ing grace. Remember that true victory is to overcome your&s;elves, and true &s;trength to break the tempter's &s;nare: Therefore henceforward 'be &s;trong in the LORD and in the power of his might,' that you may be famed among tho&s;e worthy <HI>young men,</HI> to whom the Apo&s;tle wrote, 'Becau&s;e they were &s;trong and had overcome the wicked one.' In this way you may hope before long to &s;ee matters take a new and dif|ferent turn, for the better, in this place. And it is to you, dear youth, that we principally look, under GOD, to forward &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed revolu|tion. You are now in your forming age, and &s;o more likely to receive good impre&s;&s;ions, than tho&s;e who have long 'accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to do evil.' Hence to you we look, under di|vine Providence, as the &s;eed of the church, for the pre&s;ervation of religion in the places where you live: And a token for good it will be to this church and &s;ociety, if you do not di&s;appoint our hopes nor di&s;regard this my parting coun|&s;el to you; be&s;ides which, you will find your own good account therein, as by this means you will lay a good foundation for rejoicing hereafter, and not be found among tho&s;e mi&s;erable youth who will mourn at the la&s;t day, and &s;ay, how have I hated in&s;truction, and my heart de&s;pi&s;ed

reproof, and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that in|&s;tructed me.' But you will be found among tho&s;e happy ones who have 'heard coun&s;el and received in&s;truction, who &s;hall be wi&s;e in their latter end;' and then, if I &s;hould never more have an opportunity of &s;peaking to you in this world, I &s;hall hope to have a happy meeting and rejoicing with you together in another and a better world.</P>
<P N="2">II. LET me now addre&s;s my&s;elf to the elder people, even tho&s;e of this flock, who are pa&s;t their childhood and youth, and have arrived to an advanced age&mdash;to parents and heads of fa|milies. Hear my la&s;t coun&s;el and advice to you; and that for your own &s;akes, and al&s;o for the ri&s;ing generation among you. Remember the eyes of the younger will be upon you, as the guide of their youth; at lea&s;t they will, in all probability be very much influenced by your conduct and example, whither it be virtuous or vicious. Oh &s;ee, therefore, you behave your|&s;elves "circum&s;pectly, not as fools but as wi&s;e, redeeming your time becau&s;e the days are evil'. Improve your religious opportunities, &s;uch as you &s;hall have whither publick or private, to the be&s;t advantage. Oh! let not the children and youth &s;ee you, who are older than they, trifling with the precious &s;ea&s;ons of grace, and neglect|ing your &s;oul's &s;alvation; le&s;t you bring the 'guilt of their blood' as well as your own, up|on you. E&s;pecially doth this exhortation be|long to you, who have the care of children and families. Do not content your&s;elves, barely with not hindering them in the ways of religi|on, by your bad examples, but endeavour, as much as in you lies, to further them as well as
<PB N="28" REF="011687_0027_0F87ECA01C715388">
your&s;elves therein; according to <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s re&s;o|lution, re&s;olve that, by divine grace, 'as for you and your hou&s;e, you will &s;erve the Lord.' Therefore be frequently praying with and for them&mdash;improve all opportunities in coun&s;elling, advi&s;ing and catachizing them, e&s;pecially on Lord's-days, whil&s;t you are deprived of the &s;ta|ted preaching of the word among you; and en|deavour thereby to make up, as much as po&s;&s;i|ble the lack of mini&s;terial in&s;truction, even by abounding &s;o much the more in parental, fa|mily and private in&s;tructions, admonitions and re&s;traints. In this way, wait upon GOD for his gracious return to you in the way of his pub|lick ordinances. Avoid every thing in heart, &s;peech and behaviour, in your per&s;onal and re|lative conduct, that may have a tendency to provoke the lord to leave you long without tho&s;e u&s;ual means of convincing and converting &s;inners and edifying &s;aints. Beware of barren|ne&s;s and unfruitfulne&s;s under what you do &s;till enjoy; 'for to him that hath, &s;hall be given.' i. e. They that improve the &s;piritual privile|ges and advantages they do enjoy, may hope for greater advantages of the &s;ame na|ture. Whereas, 'from him that hath not, &s;hall be taken away even that which he hath.' Now by ob&s;erving the&s;e cautions and exhortations, dearly beloved, you may humbly hope, that in GOD's time, you &s;hall yet &s;ee good days; and that he will 'make you glad according to the years wherein he hath afflicted you.'</P>
<P>BUT to draw towards a conclu&s;ion&mdash;Let one and all, young and old, male and female, pa|rents and children, labour, in the re&s;pects be|forementioned, to 'be perfect, to be of one mind, living in peace;' and then you may 'be

of good comfort,' a&s;&s;uring your&s;elves that 'the GOD of love and peace &s;hall be with you,' for GOD lives, GOD loves, CHRIST interceeds: and though the great &s;overeign head of the church has permitted &s;uch a &s;eperation to take place here, between mini&s;ter and people, before death had di&s;&s;olved the pa&s;toral relation; yet let us not be inordinately di&s;quieted at &s;uch an event; only make &s;ure of CHRIST, and you may be of good comfort &s;till&mdash;for has he not &s;aid, 'fear not little flock, it is your Father's good plea&s;ure to give you the kingdom.' While CHRIST is your Shepherd, both the &s;heep and lambs of the flock &s;hall find pa&s;ture: Therefore be not di&s;mayed, you cannot finally mi&s;carry, whil&s;t you are 'followers of the LAMB,' and are &s;uitably affected with GOD's dealings with you, humbling your&s;elves for what has been ami&s;s among you in not improving former pri|vileges and go&s;pel ordinances&mdash;acknowledg|ing GOD's ju&s;tice in thus dealing with you, and your own unworthine&s;s of further favours. Yet at the &s;ame time plead with GOD for his names &s;ake, for his dear Son's &s;ake, for his pro|mi&s;e &s;ake, as well as your &s;ouls &s;ake, that he would prepare you for, and in his due time be|&s;tow &s;uch a precious gift of an a&s;cended Savi|our upon you, as a Pa&s;tor after his own heart, even one that &s;hall naturally care for your &s;pi|ritual welfare. And dearly beloved, '&s;ee that you fall not out by the way,' while you are looking out after a re&s;ettlement and preparing for it; but 'let all your things' therein 'be done with charity' Lay a&s;ide all unchri&s;tian re&s;entments towards any who you may think have been the blameable in&s;truments of the removal of your Mini&s;ter. I repeat it, do not

harbour or indulge any unbecoming re&s;ent|ments or grudges again&s;t one another, upon your own account, or <HI>for my &s;ake,</HI> whom you may think injuriou&s;ly treated. For I do de&s;ire from my very heart to forgive any per&s;onal injury done me, and I pray GOD to forgive them and me, and hope you will do likewi&s;e. Be per&s;wa|ded to 'put on, as the elect of GOD, bowels of mercies, kindne&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, meekne&s;s, long-&s;uffering, forbearing one ano|ther, forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel again&s;t any, even as GOD for CHRIST &s;ake hath forgiven you.'</P>
<P>WHAT &s;hall I add further, but a few mi&s;|cellaneous coun&s;els and exhortations? Pray mind your families more than ever. The few|er opportunities you have in publick, on Sa|bath-Days or lecture days, O! be more dili|gent and con&s;cientious in reading, meditation, and prayer in your families and clo&s;ets. When you cannot hear Sermons, then read Sermons, and call to mind what you have heard.</P>
<P>ARE there any children or youth who are re|joicing at the thoughts of their Mini&s;ter's de|parture from them, in hopes they &s;hall be un|der le&s;s re&s;traints on Sabbath-Days and other times? O! do you, who have the care and watch over them, di&s;appoint their vain expec|tations and wicked hopes; and they will, it is to be hoped, one day give you a thou&s;and thanks that they have had &s;uch parents and &s;uch ma&s;ters; though now they may murmur and complain of &s;uch re&s;traints.</P>
<P>AND as to &s;uch, among you, as fear GOD and are mourning under this &s;ad providence that has befallen you, O! lay not the blame any where, &s;o much as upon your&s;elves. I de|&s;ire to take part to my&s;elf, and be humbled

before GOD this day, under a &s;en&s;e of my own barrenne&s;s and unfruitfulne&s;s, yea, for my un|&s;peakable defectivene&s;s in my work, who have been &s;o long honoured of the LORD with a &s;tanding in the vineyard. And wherein&s;oever my neglects and mi&s;carriages in the mini&s;try, have been the means of procuring or continu|ing any divine judgments upon this &s;ociety, (in&s;tead of '&s;tanding in the gap' to keep them off I de&s;ire to fly to the atoning blood of JE|SUS CHRIST, which was &s;hed for the prie&s;t|hood as well as for the people; and hope you will improve your intere&s;t in Heaven for me, as I de&s;ire to improve mine for you, that we may be together pardoned, purged, and &s;aved, through the merits of the Redeemer.</P>
<P>I FIND in hi&s;tory, that when idolatry was once e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, in&s;tead of the true re|ligion; tho&s;e who &s;uffered martyrdom on the account of it, did not lay the blame of it &s;o much upon the law makers, nor upon their per&s;ecu|tors as upon them&s;elves, upon their own hearts. One of them &s;aid, 'all this is come upon us be|cau&s;e we did not love the go&s;pel.' Another, when his min&s;ter was &s;ilenced, comes to this re&s;olution, 'well, by the grace of GOD, the world &s;hall never have tho&s;e hours that I u&s;ed to &s;pend in hearing GOD's preached word, they &s;hall now be &s;pent in my clo&s;et and in holy du|ties.' If I could prevail with you as well as per|&s;wade my&s;elf to make &s;uch an improvement of the rebukes of providence which we have met with, I &s;hould believe that the devil and his kingdom would be loo&s;ers by this our parting; that is, if we could but be brought to prize the go&s;pel more, and by how much the le&s;s oppor|tunities we have in publick, be &s;o much the more in private duties, &s;uch as prayer, reading,

meditation, and in&s;tructing our families.</P>
<P>TRULY, my beloved hearers, do not the &s;ilent Sabbaths which &s;eem to be coming upon you, loudly proclaim the importance of that doctrine which I am, and have long been prea|ching to you? even &s;peedy 'repentance to|wards GOD and faith' in 'our LORD JESUS CHRIST?' humble your&s;elves under the migh|ty hand of GOD; endeavour to repair your decays in religion, recover your 'fir&s;t love' and do your 'fir&s;t works.' Speedily make up the breaches among you. Oh! have not parents and heads of families much to repent of, and cau&s;e to lament before the LORD this day for their omi&s;&s;ions in duty, in their particular rela|tion? And have not children much to be hum|bled for, on account of their di&s;obedience and want of &s;ubjecting them&s;elves to the good or|der and government of the families to which they appertain? Nay, who is there among us all, but have rea&s;on to &s;ay, 'what have I done'. Let every one therefore &s;earch and &s;ee what has been ami&s;s in their hearts and lives, and in their hou&s;es, and repent and reform, 'putting away all iniquity far from your tabernacles'; and then &s;hall you be lifted up in due time; yea, you &s;hall be built up in perfection and comfort, in unity and peace.</P>
<P>TO conclude, hearken to that exhortatation in <HI>Phil.</HI> 1 xxvii. 'Only let your conver&s;ation be as becometh the go&s;pel of CHRIST: that whither I come and &s;ee you or el&s;e be ab&s;ent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye &s;tand fa&s;t in one mind, &s;triving together for the faith of the go&s;pel. I &s;hut up all with that in <HI>Acts</HI> 20.32. <HI>And now brethren, I commend you to GOD and to the word of his grace&punc; which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are &s;anctified.</HI>&mdash; AMEN.</P>
