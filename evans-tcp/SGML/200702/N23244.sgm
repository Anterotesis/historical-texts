<P><HI>Meantime the game&s;ter returned to the hou&s;e he had ju&s;t quitted, with the account of his di&s;a&s;ter.

<P>When he arrived at home he was met on the &s;tairs by a girl he kept, but to whom, from the derangement of his finan|ces, he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly paid but little attention.

<P><HI>At that moment the officers of ju&s;|tice, who had lo&s;t no time in pro&s;ecu|ting their information, entered the hou&s;e; and &s;ome of them accompani|ed by an attorney, employed by the gentleman who had been robbed, wal|ked &s;oftly up &s;tairs to the room where</HI> Anne&s;ly <HI>was; and bur&s;ting into it be|fore he could prepare for any defence, laid hold of him in rather a violent man|ner; which the lawyer ob&s;erving, defi|ed them to u&s;e the gentleman civilly, till he &s;hould ask him a few que&s;tions.

She called therefore, this leader of the party in|to another room, and being informed by him that the young gentleman was &s;u&s;pected of having committed a rob|bery &s;carce an hour before, &s;he pulled out the pur&s;e which &s;he had ju&s;t recei|ved from him, and a&s;ked the lawyer if it was that which had been taken from his client? "Ay, that it is, I'll be &s;worn, &s;aid he; and here (pouring out its con|tents) is the ring he mentioned at the bottom."&mdash;"But, &s;aid &s;he, pau&s;ing a little, it will prove the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thing as well without the guineas." "I prote&s;t returned the lawyer, thou art a girl of excellent invention&mdash;Hum&mdash;here are four &s;core; one half of them might have been &s;pent or dropt out by the way, or&mdash;any thing may be &s;uppo&s;ed; and &s;o we &s;hall have twenty a piece.

which happened to lie on that &s;ide whence he had turned; and, after &s;ev|eral fruitle&s;s efforts to make his way through it, he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t from the attempt, and tread back the &s;teps he had made, till he returned to the open part of the heath. Here he &s;tood, uncertain what cour&s;e to take&punc; when he ob&s;erved at a di&s;tance the twin|kling of a light, which immediately de|termined him.

<P>The lightning, which now fla&s;hed a|round him&punc; di&s;covered on each hand the earth rai&s;ed into mounds that &s;eem|ed graves of the dead, and here and there a bond lay mouldering on the walk he trod.

to die <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oon after my arrival there. I got my freedom, therefore, though it was but to change it for a &s;ervice as &s;e|vere as my former: I was enli&s;ted in a regiment then &s;tationed in the i&s;land, and being con&s;idered as a felon, un|worthy of any mild treatment, was con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to every hard&s;hip which the harde&s;t duty, or the mo&s;t continual expo&s;ure to the dangers of the climate could inflict.</P>
<P>Had I revealed my &s;tory, and taken advantage of that di&s;tinction which my birth and education would have made between the other convicts and me, it is probable I might have prevented mo&s;t of the evils both of my former and pre&s;ent &s;ituation: but I &s;et out from the fir&s;t with a fixed determina|tion to bear every part of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h|ment which the law allots to the mean|e&s;t and mo&s;t unfriended.

The&s;e quali|ties made me be taken notice of by &s;ome of the officers of the regiment&punc; and afterwards, when our regiment was ordered to America, and went on &s;ome indian expeditions, were &s;till more &s;erviceable, and more attractive of ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means I began to obliterate the di&s;grace which my &s;ituation at en|li&s;ting had fixed upon me, and it &s;till regarded as a ru&s;&s;ian, I was at lea&s;t ac|knowledged to be a u&s;eful one.</P>
<P>Not long after, on occa&s;ion of a piece of &s;ervice I performed for an officer on an advanced guard, that was attacked by a party of ho&s;tile indians, I was promoted to a halbert.</P>
<P>The &s;tigma, however, of my tran&s;|portation was not yet entirely forgot|ten, and by &s;ome it was the better re|membered, becau&s;e of my pre&s;ent ad|vancement. One of tho&s;e, with whom I was not on good terms, was partic|ularly offended at being commanded,

as he termed it, by a jail-bird; and one day, when I was on guard, had drawn on the back of my coat, the picture of a gallows, on which was hung a figure in caricature, with the initials of my name written over it.</P>
<P>This was an affront too gro&s;s to be borne; having &s;ought out the man, who did not deny the charge, I challen|ged him to give me &s;atisfaction by fighting me.

<HEAD>A pro&s;ecution of the di&s;covery mentioned in the la&s;t chapter.</HEAD>
<P>"I HAVE been a wicked woman&mdash; May God and this lady forgive me! But Heaven is my witne&s;s, that I was thus far on my way to confe&s;s all to your honor, (turning to Sir Thomas Sindal) that I might have peace in my mind before I died.</P>
<P>"You well remember, Sir, that this young lady's mother was delivered of her at the hou&s;e of one of your tenants where a Mr. Camplin (I think that was his name) brought her for that purpo&s;e. I was intru&s;ted with the charge of her as her nur&s;e, along with &s;ome trinkets, &s;uch as young children are in u&s;e to have, and a con&s;iderable &s;um of money to provide any other nece&s;&s;aries &s;he &s;hould want.</P>
<P>At that very time I had been drawn in to a&s;&s;ociate with a band of pilfering vagrants, who&s;e &s;tolen goods I had re|cived into my hou&s;e, and helped to di&s;|po&s;e of.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="030728_0059_0FE8CAC6C6DFDF58">"Fearing therefore that I might one day be brought to an account for my pa&s;t offences, if I remained where I was, and having at the &s;ame time the temptation of &s;uch a booty before me, I formed a &s;cheme for making off with the money and trinkets I had got from Mr. Camplin; it was, to make things ap|pear as if my charge and I had been lo&s;t in cro&s;&s;ing the river, which then hap|pened to be in flood. For that pur|po&s;e, I daubed my own cloak and the infant's wrapper with mud and &s;leech, and left them clo&s;e to the overflow of the &s;tream, a little below the common ford.</P>
<P>"With &s;hame I confe&s;s it, I was more than once tempted to drown the child, that &s;he might not be a burden to me in my flight; but &s;he looked &s;o innocent and &s;weet, while &s;he cla&s;ped my fingers in her little hand, that I had not the heart to execute my pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>"Having endeavored in this manner to account for my di&s;appearing, &s;o as to prevent all farther inquiry, I joined a party of tho&s;e wretches who&s;e a&s;&s;ociate I had &s;ome time been, and left that part
<PB N="62" REF="030728_0060_0FE8CAC85ACB38F0">
of the country altogether. By their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance too, I was put on a method of di&s;gui&s;ing my face &s;o much, that had a|ny of my acquaintance met me, of which there was very little chance, it would have been &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for them to recollect it. My booty was put into the common &s;tock, and the child was found u&s;eful to rai&s;e compa&s;&s;ion when we went a begging, which was one part of our occupation.</P>
<P>"After I had continued in this &s;ocie|ty the be&s;t part of a year, during which time we met with various turns of for|tune, a &s;cheme was formed by the re|maining part of us (for &s;everal of my companions had been bani&s;hed, or con|fined to hard labor in the interval) to break into the hou&s;e of a wealths far|mer, who, we under&s;tood, had a few days before received a large &s;um of mo|ney on a bargain for the lea&s;e of an e&s;|tate, which the proprietor had redee|med.</P>
<P>"Our project was executed with &s;uc|ce&s;s; but a quarrel ari&s;ing about the di&s;tribution of the &s;poil, one of the gang de&s;erted, and informed a neigh|boring ju&s;tice of the whole tran&s;action,
<PB N="63" REF="030728_0061_0FE8CAD08AAC21C8">
and the places of our retreat. I hap|pened to be a fortune-telling in this gentleman's hou&s;e, when his informer came to make the di&s;covery; and, be|ing clo&s;eted with one of the maid &s;erv|ants, overheard him inquiring for the ju&s;tice, and de&s;iring to have &s;ome con|ver&s;ation with him in private I im|mediately &s;u&s;pected his de&s;ign, and hav|ing got out of the hou&s;e, eluded pur|&s;uit by my knowledge in the bye paths and private roads of the country.</P>
<P>"It immediately occured to me to di&s;burden my&s;elf of the child&punc; as &s;he not only retarded my flight, but was a mark by which I might be di&s;covered. But, abandoned as I had then become, I found my&s;elf attached to the child by that &s;ort of affection which women conceive for the infants they &s;uckle. I would not, therefore, expo&s;e the child in any of tho&s;e unfrequented places through which I pa&s;&s;ed in my flight, where her death mu&s;t have been the certain con&s;equence, and two or three times, when I would have dropped her at &s;ome farmer's door, I was prevented by the fear of di&s;cove|ry.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="030728_0062_0FE8CAD278C91818">"At la&s;t, I happened to meet with your honor. You may recollect, Sir, that the &s;ame night on which this lady, then an infant, was found, a beggar a&s;ked a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ms of you at a farrier's door, where you stopped to have one of your hor&s;e's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fa&s;tened. I was that beg|gar; and, hearing from a boy who held your hor&s;e, that your name was Sir Thomas Sindal, and that you were re|turning to a hunting &s;eat you had in the neighborhood, I left the infant on a narrow part of the road a little way before you, where it was impo&s;&s;ible you could mi&s;s of finding her, and &s;tood at the back of a hedge to ob&s;erve your behaviour when you came up.</P>
<P>"I &s;aw you make your &s;ervant pick up the child, and place her on the fad|ble before him. Then having, as I thought, &s;ufficiently provided for her, by thus throwing her under the protec|tion of her father, I made off as fa&s;t as I could, and continued my flight, until I imagined I was out of the reach of de|tection.</P>
<P>"But being &s;ometime after appre|hended on &s;u&s;picion, and not being a|ble to give a good account of my&s;elf, I
<PB N="65" REF="030728_0063_0FE8CADB08C88130">
was adverti&s;ed in the papers and di&s;cov|ered to be an accomplice in the robbery I have mentioned, for which &s;ome of the gang had been already condemned and executed.</P>
<P>I was tried for the crime and ca&s;t for tran&s;portation. Before I was put on board the &s;hip that was to carry me and &s;everal others abroad, I wrote a few lines to your honor, acquainting you of the circum&s;tances of my behaviour to|wards you daughter; but this I &s;uppo&s;e, as it was entru&s;ted to the boy that u&s;ed to go on errands for the pri&s;oners, you never received. Not long ago I return|ed from tran&s;portation, and betook my&s;elf to my old cour&s;e of life again, but I happened to be &s;eized with the &s;mall pox, that raged in a village I was pa&s;&s;ing through, and partly from the violence of the di&s;temper, partly from want of proper attendance in the fir&s;t &s;tages of it, was brought &s;o low, that the phy&s;ician who&s;e humani|ty had induced him to attend upon me, utterly de&s;paired of my recovery. And I found that the terrors of death on a &s;ick bed, had more effect on my con|&s;cience,
<PB N="66" REF="030728_0064_0FE8CBF664363F98">
than all the hard&s;hips I had heretofore undergone.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions I began to look back with the keene&s;t remor&s;e on a life &s;o &s;pent as mine had been. It plea&s;ed God, however, that I &s;hould recover, and have &s;ince endeavored to make &s;ome reparation for my pa&s;t of|fences, by my penitence.</P>
<P>"Among other things, I often reflec|ted on what I had done with regard to the child; and being &s;ome days ago ac|cidentally near Sindal park, I went thi|ther, and tried to learn &s;omething of what had befallen her.</P>
<P>"I under&s;tood, from &s;ome of the neighbors, that a young lady had been brought up from her infancy with her aunt, and was &s;aid to be the daughter of a friend of yours, who had commit|ted her to your care at his death. But upon enquiring into the time of her be|ing brought to your hou&s;e, I was per|&s;uaded that &s;he mu&s;t be the &s;ame I had conjectured, imputing the &s;tory of her being another's, to your de&s;ire of con|cealing that &s;he was yours, which I im|agined you had learned from the letter I wrote before my tran&s;portation; till
<PB N="67" REF="030728_0065_0FE8CBFAC20C8170">
meeting, at a hou&s;e of entertainment&punc; with a &s;ervant of your honor's, he in|formed me, in the cour&s;e of our conver|&s;ation, that it was reported you were going to be married to the young lady who had lived &s;o long in your family.</P>
<P>On hearing this I was confounded, and did not know what to think; but, when I began to fear that my letter had never reached you, I trembled at the thought of what my wickedne&s;s may occa&s;ion, and could have no ea&s;e in my mind till I &s;hould &s;et off for Bil&s;wood to confe&s;s the whole affair to your honor.</P>
<P>"I was to-night overtaken by the &s;torm near this hou&s;e, and prevailed on the landlady, though it &s;eemed much again&s;t her inclination, to permit me to take up my quarters here.</P>
<P>"About half an hour ago I was wak|ed with the &s;hrieks of &s;ome per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s, and upon a&s;king the landlady, who lay in the &s;ame room, what was the matter, &s;he bid me be quiet and &s;ay nothing; for it was only a worthy gen|tleman of her acquaintance, who had overtaken a young girl, a foundling, he had bred up, that had &s;tolen a &s;um of money from his hou&s;e, and ran away

with one of his footmen.

<P>Sir Thomas's &s;ervant now arrived accompanied by a &s;urgeon, who, upon examining and dre&s;&s;ing his wound, was of opinion, that in it&s;elf it had not the appearance of imminent danger, but that from the &s;tate of his pul&s;e he was apprehen&s;ive of a &s;upervening fever. He ordered him to be put to bed, and his room to be kept as quiet as po&s;&s;ible. As this gentleman was an acquaintance of Bolton's, the latter informed him of the &s;tate in which Sir Thomas's mind mu&s;t be from the di&s;coveries that the preced|ing hour had made to him.

<P>NEXT morning&punc; Sindal, by the ad|vice of his &s;urgeon was removed in a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter to his own hou&s;e, where he was &s;oon after attended by an eminent phy&s;ician in aid of that gentleman's a|bilities.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uant to his earne&s;t encreaties, he was accompanied thither by Anne&s;ly and Bolton. Lucy, having obtained leave of his medical attendants, watch|ed her father in the character of a nur&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas &s;eemed to feel a &s;ort of Melancholly &s;atisfaction in having the company of tho&s;e he had injured a&s;&s;em|bled under his roof.</P>
<P>He confe&s;&s;ed the plans of &s;eduction by which he triumphed over the vir|tue of Anne&s;ley, and the honor of his &s;i&s;ter; and acknowledged the ju&s;t re|tribution of heaven, in commi&s;&s;ioning the hand of the injured, to avenge it|&s;elf, a parent and a &s;i&s;ter, by cut|ing

off their a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in in the mid&s;t of his days.</P>
<P>In vain were all attempts to per|&s;uade him he might recover being told that in the puni&s;hments of the divin|ity there was no idea of vengeance; and that the infliction of what we term evil, &s;erves equally the purpo&s;e of uni|ver&s;al benignity, with the di&s;pen&s;ation of good.</P>
<P>"<HI>I feel,</HI>" he replied, "<HI>the force of that ob&s;ervation; the pain of this wound; the pre&s;entiment of death which it in&s;tills; the horror with which the recollection of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ince&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous pa&s;&s;ion &s;trikes me;&mdash;all the&s;e are in the catalogue of my ble&s;&s;ings.

<P>A vi&s;it from his phy&s;ician interrupted their di&s;cour&s;e; that gentleman did not progno&s;tic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;o fatally for his pa|tient; he found the frequency of his pul&s;e con&s;iderably abated, and expre&s;&s;|ed his hopes, that the &s;ucceeding night his re&s;t would be better than it had been. In this he was not mi&s;taken; and the next morning the doctor con|tinued to think Sir Thomas fa&s;t mend|ing;

but him&s;elf per&s;i&s;ted in the be|lief that he &s;hould not recover.</P>
<P>For &s;everal days, however, he appear|ed rather to gain ground than to lo&s;e it; but afterwards he was &s;eized with hectic fits at &s;tated intervals, and when they left him, he complained of a uni|ver&s;al weakne&s;s and depre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>During all this time, Lucy was &s;eld|om away from his bed &s;ide: From her pre&s;ence he derived peculiar plea&s;ure; and &s;ometimes, when he was &s;o low as to be &s;carce able to &s;peak; would mut|ter out ble&s;&s;ings on her head, calling her his &s;aint, his guardian angel.</P>
<P>After he had exhau&s;ted all the pow|ers of medicine, under the direction of &s;ome of the able&s;t of the faculty, they acknowledged all further a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be vain, and one of them warned him, in a friendly manner, of his approaching end.</P>
<P>He received this information with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure, as an event he had expected from the beginning, thanked the phy&s;ician for his candor, and de&s;ired that his friends might be &s;ummoned around him, while he had

<P>Tears were the only an&s;wer he re|ceived.

<P>Lucy was too tender to bear the &s;cene&punc; her friend, Mrs. Wi&s;tanly, led her al|mo&s;t fainting out of the room.
