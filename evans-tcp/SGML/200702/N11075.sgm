<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON CIVIL GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 SAMUEL, VIII.22.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And the Lord &s;aid to <HI>Samuel,</HI> Hearken unto their voice, and make them a King. And <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;aid unto the men of I&s;rael, Go ye every man unto his city.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_WHEN good Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, who had long judged I&s;rael well, was grown old, and by rea&s;on of the in|firmities of age was rendered very inca|pable of the important tru&s;t, and could no longer judge and govern the people, he made his &s;ons Joel and Abiah judges over I&s;rael. But I&s;rael &s;oon growing unea&s;y under the government and pre&s;idency of his &s;ons, by rea&s;on of their evil govern|ment and male-admini&s;tration, for they walked not in the &s;teps of Samuel their father, it occa&s;ioned great mutinies and contentions: till finally, the unea&s;ine&s;s of the people grew &s;o great, and they were &s;o highly di&s;gu&s;ted at the admini&s;trations of his &s;ons, all the elders of I&s;rael ga|thered them&s;elves together, and came unto Samuel, to Ramah, and told him, what he was well &s;en&s;ible of, of
<PB N="4" REF="014036_0004_0F92ACC51C592420">
his own incapacity to judge and govern them as he had done, and complained to him aloud of the ill-manage|ment of his &s;ons&mdash;that they had left the right way of go|verning which he had &s;o happily pur&s;ued, and rendered them&s;elves extremely odious on that account, and even intolerable to the people. And now they manife&s;t their de&s;ire of a King, one who &s;hould rule according to right and equity; and pray his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to con&s;titute and &s;et one over them, to judge, rule and govern them, as was cu&s;tomary in all other nations.</P>
<P>SAMUEL intimates his di&s;plea&s;ure at their reque&s;t of a King; fearing they did not pay that re&s;pect to Jehovah which they ought; and from the Lord he &s;hews them the manner of the King who &s;hould reign over them; how he would conduct with them, their families and inheri|tances, and what would be the maxims of that govern|ment which he would exerci&s;e over the people, in the cour&s;e of his reign. Notwith&s;tanding all this, the peo|ple per&s;i&s;ted in their reque&s;t of a King, and &s;till continu|ed their petition. And though perhaps the circum&s;tances attending I&s;rael's reque&s;t at this time, and their ob&s;tina|cy in it, after the prophets remon&s;trances again&s;t it, were not to be commended, the Lord &s;o far overlooked this, that he commanded Samuel to hearken to, and gratify the people, by accompli&s;hing their de&s;ire in con&s;tituting a King to rule and govern them.</P>
<P>THEN Samuel &s;ays to the men of I&s;rael, be contented and ea&s;y in your minds, go every man unto his city, and patiently wait until I &s;hall be in&s;tructed further concern|ing a King, and the method of his being con&s;tituted over you, and placed in his royal dignity and government.</P>
<P>FROM the words now read unto you, and thus intro|duced, I &s;hall propo&s;e the following things to be di&s;cour&s;|ed upon, viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THAT a people have a natural and inherent right to appoint and con&s;titute a King &s;upreme, and all &s;ubordinate civil officers and rulers over them, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and &s;afety.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="5" REF="014036_0005_0F92ACC89DB32E10">II. I SHALL undertake to &s;hew what are the duties and obligations of a King thus erected by the people, and of all &s;ubordinate rulers and civil officers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. WHAT are the duties and obligations of the peo|ple in civil &s;tate, to their civil rulers, both &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate, whil&s;t they fulfil their tru&s;t, and an&s;wer their obligations to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. I SHALL endeavour to prove that the people have right and authority to dethrone their King, and put down all other civil officers and rulers of &s;ubordinate degree, whenever they &s;hall counteract their obli|gations, and cea&s;e to an&s;wer the ends of their con&s;ti|tution and appointment to places of civil tru&s;t and power.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I SHALL not undertake very &s;crupulou&s;ly to enquire whether all the&s;e propo&s;itions have a real foundation, and in being in the words of my text, and may be clearly de|ducted from them, or not; it &s;hall &s;uffice for me, if they are true, and capable of &s;ub&s;tantial proof and vindication, which I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew them to be. I begin with the fir&s;t, viz.</P>
<P N="1">I. THAT a people have a natural and inherent right to appoint and con&s;titute a King &s;upreme, and all &s;ubor|dinate civil officers and rulers over them, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and &s;afety.</P>
<P>HOWEVER true, and capable of clear proof from rea&s;on and the nature of things, this propo&s;ition may appear to unprejudiced and thinking men, yet it is denied by &s;ome, who&s;e minds are full of prejudiced notions, and who are le&s;s capable of rea&s;oning clo&s;ely and judging right.</P>
<P>SOME of the greate&s;t men that ever wrote on politics, have a&s;&s;erted and maintained that all civil powers and authority originates from the people: with whom I hear|tily agree. Others who&s;e learning and judgment in other things ought not to be impeached, have a&s;&s;erted and en|deavoured to maintain that King's derive their power and authority to reign over the people from God only: with whom I cannot agree.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, not regarding &s;o much what any men have
<PB N="6" REF="014036_0006_0F92ACC8D6EF75C0">
&s;aid or wrote, for or again&s;t the pre&s;ent propo&s;ition, my bu&s;ine&s;s is to prove and vindicate its truth; which I &s;hall endeavour to do in the &s;ub&s;equent propo&s;itions, rea&s;on|ings and conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>EVERY &s;ingle man in a &s;tate of nature, and before any thing is given up by him, to a civil State, or Com|munity, for the general good, utility and happine&s;s of &s;uch State or Community, by voluntary and &s;olemn league, covenant and compact, hath a principle of in|dividuation; <HI>i. e.</HI> he hath &s;uch natural and undoubted right to, and property in &s;ome things, as no other man upon earth has: He has &s;omething he may ju&s;tly call his own, and may appropriate it to him&s;elf, in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as no other man may call it his, or appropriate it to him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>A,</HI> HATH a right to, and property in, his hand, in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as <HI>B</HI> hath not, nor can have; he may with great ju&s;tice call his hand his own, and he hath an indi|vidual and entire right to, and property in his hand, which <HI>B</HI> cannot have. And it would be a manife&s;t and intolerable inva&s;ion of <HI>A</HI>'s right and property, if <HI>B</HI> &s;hould pretend to lay claim to his hand, or pre&s;ume to u&s;e it as though it were his own, and as though he had a ju&s;t right to, and property in it. This pretence, and this conduct in <HI>B,</HI> would be downright inju&s;tice, a pre|tence and action plainly contradictory to truth, which is always unju&s;t. If <HI>A</HI> hath &s;uch right to, and property in his hand, as he is now &s;aid to have, it follows, that he hath a right to make u&s;e of his hand, for his own ends and purpo&s;es, and according as he &s;hall plea&s;e: and <HI>B</HI> can have no right or authority to ri&s;e up and forbid <HI>A</HI> the u&s;e of his hand, or to di&s;pute with him his liberty and authority to u&s;e it according to his own plea&s;ure. For &s;uch conduct would evidently declare that <HI>B</HI> has &s;ome right to <HI>A</HI>'s hand, evidently contrary to truth, for he has none: for if <HI>B</HI> has no right to <HI>A</HI>'s hand, according to the &s;uppo&s;ition, then certainly he can have no ju&s;t right or authority to forbid <HI>A</HI> that u&s;e of it he &s;hall plea&s;e to put it to: For all authority and dominion are founded in right and property.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014036_0007_0F92ACC9F815A2B0">LET <HI>A</HI> then u&s;e his hand as he plea&s;es, he is not, in &s;o doing, abu&s;ing any property, or invading any right of <HI>B</HI>; therefore <HI>B</HI> has no ju&s;t cau&s;e to complain, or any authority to command or direct <HI>A,</HI> concerning the u&s;e of his hand, u&s;e it as he will.</P>
<P>NOW, if <HI>A</HI> hath &s;uch an individual, uncontroulable right to his hand, to one hand, he hath, to all intents and purpo&s;es, the &s;ame right al&s;o to the other; and if he hath &s;uch right to, and property in his hands, he hath al&s;o in his feet; and if &s;o, then he hath the &s;ame, or an individual right, to his head and heart, and his whole body: for it would puzzle any one to a&s;certain what property <HI>A</HI> hath to any one part of his body, that he hath not to any other part of it, or to &s;hew that he hath not the &s;ame property in one part as in an o|ther, for all his own purpo&s;es and de&s;igns. <HI>A</HI> hath then an individual right to his whole body. <HI>A</HI> hath &s;uch a right to, and property in his whole body as <HI>B</HI> hath not, nor can pretend to have, without great and intolerable injury and inju&s;tice: So that <HI>A</HI> hath an individual and undi&s;putable right to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>NOW, <HI>A</HI> having &s;uch right to, and property in him|&s;elf, to all the limbs, powers and faculties of his body, may u&s;e him&s;elf, and the&s;e powers and faculties of his, as he &s;hall judge it convenient, and for his own intere&s;t, and purpo&s;es of life.</P>
<P>Accordingly, <HI>A</HI> labours with his hands, u&s;es them in various &s;ecular employments, and is indu&s;trious in his bu&s;ine&s;s, for his &s;upport and maintenance. We will &s;uppo&s;e for the &s;ake of clearne&s;s and conviction, that <HI>A</HI> takes a piece of unoccupied land, which is claimed by no inhabitant of the earth; upon this ground he &s;ettles and builds, brings on cattle, &s;o &s;oon as prepared for them, and other living creatures, for his &s;upport and conveniency. Here he lives a number of years, manages his bu&s;ine&s;s alone, and &s;eperate from all near &s;ociety with any other rational beings, and gains a con&s;iderable e&s;tate. Now <HI>A</HI> while he dwells here alone, hath an in|dividual
<PB N="8" REF="014036_0008_0F92ACCC144986F8">
right to his land, and all that he hath brought upon it, and the effects of his own labour and toil upon it; to the Land he hath the right of prime occupancy, a very ju&s;t and good right; and to all the fruits and ef|fects of his labours, he hath ju&s;t as good a right, as he hath to his hands, with which he laboured. But he meets with many difficulties and inconveniencies in his lonely &s;ituation; till at length, the difficulties of his dwelling a|lone, and the great and many hard&s;hips he endures in this &s;tate, &s;o &s;eperate and &s;olitary, convince him ef|fectually of the truth of what the God of nature long &s;ince ob&s;erved, that
<Q>it is not good that men &s;hould be alone.</Q>
He now finds an inclination to &s;ociety, and communion with &s;ome of his fellow rational crea|tures. Therefore he comes forth of his long &s;eclu&s;ion and confinement from &s;ociety, and gets among mankind. He cultivates an acquaintance with a lady, whom he, in proper time, takes to wife and with this very agreeable companion, he returns to his former habitation and im|provements; where they each labour with a joint de&s;ign, and for a joint intere&s;t. Not to be tedious here, he has by Heaven's kind indulgence and ble&s;&s;ing, a family which he educates and brings up as well as his circum|&s;tances will admit.</P>
<P>NOW, this man and his family, when con&s;idered with reference to mankind, have an ab&s;olute and individual right to, and property in all they have earned by their labours, indu&s;try and frugality: Such right and pro|perty as no others can pretend to have, without great wrong and inju&s;tice. They may call their e&s;tate their own, and have full power and authority to u&s;e it as their own; <HI>i. e.</HI> as they &s;hall judge be&s;t, to an&s;wer their own de&s;igns and intentions.</P>
<P>No man, or number of men have a right to di&s;turb <HI>A</HI> in the enjoyment of his family and e&s;tate, or property: For to &s;uppo&s;e them to have &s;uch right, would be to &s;uppo&s;e them to have &s;ome property in <HI>A</HI>'s family and e&s;tate; for if they have no &s;uch property, the &s;uppo&s;i|tion that they have right to mole&s;t or di&s;turb <HI>A</HI> in the en|joyment
<PB N="9" REF="014036_0009_0F92ACCCB9687110">
of his family, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate, is impo&s;&s;ible: for if one man has no property in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions of another, he certainly can have no right to give any mole&s;tation to this other man in the enjoyment of them: which is a very plain ca&s;e to every one, who thinks ever &s;o little. If <HI>B</HI> has no right to begin to give mo|le&s;tation to <HI>A,</HI> who is quietly and peaceably enjoying his own e&s;tate, then neither has <HI>C, D</HI> or <HI>E,</HI> or any other; for <HI>E</HI> has as much right to <HI>A</HI>'s e&s;tate as <HI>B</HI> has, that is, none at all; and &s;o it is with <HI>C, D,</HI> and all the re&s;t. For what any one man hath as ju&s;t a right to, as any other, e|very man in the world, or all men, have as ju&s;t a right to; but what every man hath a ju&s;t right to, one as much as any other, none of them all has any ju&s;t right to; for in &s;uch ca&s;e, an equal right among all man|kind, cannot be accounted any right at all. So that no man upon earth hath any ju&s;t right to begin to di&s;turb <HI>A</HI> in the enjoyment of his family and e&s;tate.</P>
<P>BUT yet, tho' <HI>B</HI> has no ju&s;t right to give di&s;turbance or mole&s;tation to <HI>A,</HI> who is quiet in the enjoyment of his e&s;tate, or to begin to make him unhappy, <HI>A</HI> hath an undoubted right to re&s;i&s;t and repel every attempt of <HI>B</HI> to invade his property, and to make him unquiet: El&s;e, we mu&s;t inevitably deny <HI>A</HI>'s property in his e&s;tate, which we have above proved him to have. For he that hath no right to defend his property, hath no property at all: for to defend any thing from inva&s;ions, and to &s;ecure to one's &s;elf, the enjoyment of it, are the &s;ame thing with u&s;ing it as our own; but in any thing, which we have not a right to u&s;e as our own, we can never be &s;aid to have the &s;ole property: therefore, if we have not a right to defend our e&s;tates, and to &s;ecure the enjoyment of them to our&s;elves, we have not the &s;ole property in them: If <HI>A</HI> has not a right to defend his e&s;tate, and to &s;ecure the enjoyment of it to him&s;elf, again&s;t all the inva&s;ions of <HI>B, C, D, E,</HI> &amp;c. he hath not the &s;ole property in it: but that <HI>A</HI> hath an individual and independent right and property in his e&s;tate, is according to the &s;uppo&s;i|tion,
<PB N="10" REF="014036_0010_0F92ACCD670808F0">
therefore <HI>A</HI> hath an undoubted right to defend his e&s;tate from all inva&s;ions of <HI>B,</HI> or any other, and to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the enjoyment of it.</P>
<P>THUS we mu&s;t conclude, that <HI>A,</HI> or any man, hath an undoubted right, in a &s;tate of nature, which is all along the &s;uppo&s;ition, to defend his e&s;tate, yea, and mo&s;t certainly his per&s;on too, from all unju&s;t attempts upon them, or inva&s;ions of them from any quarter what&s;oever. No man will di&s;pute any one's right to defend and &s;e|cure his per&s;on from all a&s;&s;aults and injuries, if he al|lows him to have right to defend and &s;ecure his e&s;tate; for he had a property in his per&s;on which no other man could pretend to, without great inju&s;tice and violation of truth, before he acquired his e&s;tate: And it was done by the labours he him&s;elf be&s;towed, and the u&s;e of his own limbs, that he gained his e&s;tate. <HI>A</HI> then hath an indi&s;putable right to defend his per&s;on and property from all attempts, come whence, or from whom they may, and to &s;ecure the enjoyment of them to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS rea&s;oning may be carried yet farther, for if this be the ca&s;e, if <HI>A</HI> hath &s;uch an indi&s;puted right to defend his per&s;on and property from all injuries and a&s;&s;aults what&s;oever, and to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the quiet enjoy|ment of them, then he hath mo&s;t certainly a right to make repri&s;als in ca&s;e his per&s;on be injured, and his pro|perty be taken out of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment, upon that man who &s;hall be &s;o intolerably unju&s;t, and have &s;o little regard to truth, as to commit &s;uch injury upon his per&s;on, and make &s;uch inva&s;ion of his property. For if <HI>A</HI> hath an indi&s;putable and individual right to his per&s;on and property, and to defend them from all a&s;|&s;aults, and &s;ecure to him&s;elf the enjoyment of them, then, if his per&s;on chance to be injured, and his pro|perty &s;eized and u&s;ed by another, he hath ju&s;t as good a right to an equivalent to the injury done his per&s;on, and to the e&s;tate which was &s;eized and taken from him, as he has to his per&s;on and e&s;tate, or property. For to &s;ay a man has an indi&s;putable and individual right to his
<PB N="11" REF="014036_0011_0F92ACCE273965A8">
per&s;on and property, and to defend and &s;ecure to him|&s;elf the enjoyment of them, again&s;t all inva&s;ions and a&s;|&s;aults that may be made upon them, and yet, that he hath not a right, if his per&s;on be injuriou&s;ly treated, and his property &s;eized and u&s;ed by another, without his con&s;ent, to an equivalent for the injury done to his per&s;on and property in the a&s;&s;ault and &s;eizure, is a flat contradiction. For to have an individual right to any thing, and a right to an equivalent to that thing, if the thing be taken away, and he who had the individual right, be now deprived of the enjoyment of the thing, are the &s;ame. He therefore who hath an individual right to his per&s;on and property, and to defend and &s;ecure to him&s;elf the enjoyment of them again&s;t all a&s;&s;aults and inva&s;ions what&s;oever, hath a right to an equivalent to any injury that &s;hall be done his per&s;on, or &s;eizure of his property; <HI>i. e.</HI> he hath a right to make repri&s;als up|on any man who &s;hall injure his per&s;on, or invade his property, when&s;oever opportunity &s;hall pre&s;ent for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I THEREFORE conclude, that every man in a &s;tate of nature, or where no civil government is yet erected, hath an individual and mo&s;t ju&s;t right to an equivalent to any injury that &s;hall be done his per&s;on, or any in|va&s;ion and &s;eizure of his property; and that where&s;o|ever he &s;hall find it, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him who did the wrong, and when&s;oever he &s;hall have an opportunity, to take it to him&s;elf. And all the mi&s;chief and blood|&s;hed, if there &s;hould be any, while the injured man de|fends his per&s;on, or is taking to him&s;elf his equivalent for the &s;eizure of his e&s;tate or property, mu&s;t forever lye at the door of him who did the injury.</P>
<P>BUT who is not appri&s;ed of the terrible conte&s;ts, the horrid and &s;preading mi&s;chiefs, the blood&s;hed and the death, which will inevitably follow and take place, if every man mu&s;t defend and &s;ecure his own per&s;on and property again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults and ravages of all others, who &s;hall from time to time injure his per&s;on, or invade his property: If he mu&s;t al&s;o, as he hath an undoubted
<PB N="12" REF="014036_0012_0F92ACD032A7CDD0">
right to do, in rea&s;on and con&s;cience, make repri&s;als when&s;oever his per&s;on is injured, or his property invaded and &s;eized? He that is &s;o unju&s;t, and pays &s;o little re|gard to truth, as to injure another per&s;on, or invade and &s;eize his property, when he hath a convenient opportu|nity for &s;uch black de&s;igns, will certainly, if he be pur|&s;ued by the injured man, and pre&s;&s;ed upon by him who is engaged to obtain his right, or an equivalent, de|fend him&s;elf at all adventures; even though he &s;hould be the death of him whom he hath &s;o villainou&s;ly injured already: For he who &s;hall prove the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t powerful in this &s;orry conte&s;t will get the victory, tho' he &s;hould hazard the other's life and fortune all toge|ther.</P>
<P>BUT if we &s;uppo&s;e that &s;everal, or ever &s;o large a number of families, have &s;ettled in the neighbourhood of <HI>A,</HI> whom we have &s;uppo&s;ed hitherto to be alone, with only his own family; &s;till the &s;ame truths may be a&s;&s;erted of them all. Every individual of ever &s;o large a &s;ociety, whil&s;t they remain in a &s;tate of nature, has an individual right to his per&s;on and property, and very ju&s;t authority to defend them from all a&s;&s;aults and inva|&s;ions what&s;oever, and to &s;ecure the enjoyment of them to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>YET in &s;uch a degenerate, unju&s;t and di&s;ingenuous world as we live in, 'tis very po&s;&s;ible that many may league, a&s;&s;ociate, and combine together to give di&s;|turbance to &s;ome one man in the enjoyment of his per|&s;on and property: they may agree to injure and abu&s;e his per&s;on, and to &s;eize upon his property and e&s;tate, and to take and u&s;e them as their own, contrary to his will, and without any con&s;ent of his.</P>
<P>THUS injury and rapine may be committed upon the per&s;on and property of any individual; and he, tho' he has a natural, inherent and indi&s;putable right to his per&s;on and property, and to defend and &s;ecure them, what can he do in &s;uch ca&s;e? how &s;hall he go about to a&s;&s;ert his right, and defend his per&s;on and e&s;|tate from the injury, rapine and ravages of this lawle&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="014036_0013_0F92ACD06D4FC310">
and unnatural combination? how &s;hall he now &s;ecure to him&s;elf the quiet and undi&s;turbed enjoyment of his per|&s;on and property? To pretend to ri&s;e up in oppo&s;ition to this riotous, injurious and rapacious rout alone, and to en|deavour to a&s;&s;ert &amp; defend his right again&s;t them, will mo&s;t certainly prove an in&s;ignificant attempt; and will &s;erve no other purpo&s;e than to convince him of the impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of it. But &s;hall the man &s;uffer any injuries upon his per&s;on, and &s;eizure of his property, which this a|bandoned crew &s;hall plea&s;e, and be quiet? O Heavens! does not every &s;park of humanity and pity catch fire, and quick enkindle in every generous brea&s;t at the ve|ry thought of &s;uch cruelty and inju&s;tice! certainly this is mo&s;t di&s;agreeable to all principles of natural ju&s;tice, righteou&s;ne&s;s and equity, if there be any &s;uch thing ex|i&s;ting any where. But how can the man prevent his &s;uf|fering in &s;uch &s;ort? to pretend a redre&s;s, or to make re|pri&s;als alone, we &s;ee will not be &s;ignificant of any thing but folly and madne&s;s. And if he &s;hould by a pathetic expo&s;ition of his ca&s;e to others, by prayers and tears, and the mo&s;t powerful per&s;ua&s;ions and entreaties he can u&s;e, gain &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his neighbours; if this &s;hould prove in&s;ufficient and unavailable, he will certainly be left in as bad, likely a wor&s;e &s;ituation than he was in be|fore: Perhaps he will &s;o enrage the injurious and de&s;|perate multitude, as will excite them to commit &s;till greater injuries and mi&s;chiefs. If he &s;hould gain a num|ber &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t and repel all the a&s;&s;aults and in|va&s;ions of the&s;e unju&s;t wretches, or to make ju&s;t repri&s;als for the injuries and rapines already commited, who does not &s;ee that this will pre&s;ently i&s;&s;ue in the total de&s;truction and extirpation of all the people?</P>
<P>I NEED to &s;ay no more, one would think, to convince every intelligent and con&s;iderate man of this great truth, a people cannot live in &s;ociety without civil govern|ment of &s;ome kind and form or other. It is not at all to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, to enquire what kind or form of civil government, whether Ari&s;tocratical, Democratical, Mo|narchial, Republican, or any other particular kind,
<PB N="14" REF="014036_0014_0F92ACD11CF1CA40">
be be&s;t, or even good to be erected among a people, Some kind or form of civil government there mu&s;t be, or no man will be quiet and &s;ecure in the enjoyment of ei|ther his per&s;on or his property.</P>
<P>AND in a civil &s;tate, 'tis evident to every one, there mu&s;t be &s;ome appointed to make laws, others to execute them; and for this end and others, there mu&s;t be a &s;ub|ordination of rulers, both in legi&s;lative and executive tru&s;t; &s;ome &s;uperior, and others inferior: And if there be one &s;upreme, one who &s;hall hold the balance of pow|er, for 'tis evident it mu&s;t be held &s;omewhere, and if this be agreed upon, this is perhaps the be&s;t. Power to make and execute laws for the general utility and e|molument of the &s;tate, mu&s;t be put in the hands of &s;ome men, of rulers and officers in &s;ubordination as above, For 'tis for the good of the &s;tate and people, that every one and the whole community, may enjoy their per|&s;ons and properties free of all mole&s;tations, inva&s;ions, rapines and inva&s;ions what&s;oever, that civil government is erected; and the&s;e great ends mu&s;t be kept in &s;ight and direct.</P>
<P>THE great enquiry here is, who &s;hall &s;et up this ci|vil government? who &s;hall make rulers &s;upreme and &s;ub|ordinate? and inve&s;t them with power and authority to make and execute laws for the good of the people? Our propo&s;ition a&s;&s;erts that a people have a natural and inherent right to appoint and con&s;titute a king &s;upreme and all &s;ubordinate civil officers and rulers over them, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and &s;afety. And this is my reply, the people have right to &s;et up a civil government, the people have right to make rulers &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate, and the people have right to inve&s;t them with power and authority to make and execute laws, &s;uch as &s;hall be promotive of their good, liberty, protection, peace, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IF the preliminary ob&s;ervations which have been made above be true and ju&s;t, and be now adverted to, and carefully con&s;idered, every one may &s;ee the proof of this propo&s;ition to be very plain and ea&s;y, almo&s;t at fir&s;t view.
<PB N="15" REF="014036_0015_0F92ACD1E3D9BFE8">
But that I may not be wanting in the full and complete proof of this point; let us &s;uppo&s;e A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. a large number of men, yet in a &s;tate of nature&punc; and without any civil government. Now 'tis very plain to every one, from what hath been &s;aid already, that each of the&s;e, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. has an inherent, in|dividual right to his own per&s;on and per&s;onal properties, and to all his e&s;tate and acqui&s;itions, and to defend and &s;ecure to him&s;elf the enjoyment of them, free from all mole&s;tations and di&s;quiet. It hath ju&s;t been proved that this cannot be done without civil government. Here it would be very vain and futile to plead, that the power and authority which God and nature have given to pa|rents and ma&s;ters will an&s;wer all the ends of civil go|vernment, or &s;erve to &s;ecure each individual in the quiet enjoyment of his own per&s;on and property. Ju&s;t as fu|tile would it be to mention the Adamic, Noachal, patri|archal, Abrahamic, &amp;c. powers and authorities, whate|ver they were, or over whom, or after what manner &s;oever they were exerci&s;ed, which I &s;hall not here &s;pend time to a&s;certain&mdash;I &s;ay, ju&s;t as futile would it be to mention the&s;e as any argument to prove that the whole &s;ociety in gene|ral, or that each individual in particular, has not an in|dividual right to his per&s;on and property, and &s;o a right to defend them, and &s;ecure to him&s;elf the enjoyment of them, and con&s;equently a right to be active in erecting a civil government, as I &s;hall immediately &s;hew that he has.</P>
<P>NOW, if the&s;e things be &s;o, if every individual, in a &s;tate of nature, has an individual right to his per&s;on and property, and to defend and &s;ecure to him&s;elf the enjoy|ment of them, as hath been abundantly proved; then B has no right to A's per&s;on or property; and then he has no right to command or controul him in the u&s;e of his per&s;on or property; then &s;urely he has no right to &s;et up him&s;elf for a judge or ruler over A; or to place him&s;elf in any the lea&s;t authority over him. For if it could be &s;uppo&s;ed that B has a right to place him&s;elf in authority over A, and to command and controul him in the u&s;e of his per&s;on and property, and to make laws by which A
<PB N="16" REF="014036_0016_0F92ACD2ABCE85F8">
&s;hall be governed in the enjoyment of his own per&s;on and property, this would be to give B a right to A's per|&s;on and property: for to exerci&s;e authority and dominion, to make and execute laws for the government of others, &s;uppo&s;eth him who doth this, to have a very great right, both to the per&s;ons and properties of tho&s;e for whom he doth it. For all right of dominion and authority is founded in property; this is an eternal verity. But to &s;uppo&s;e B to have any right to A's per&s;on or property is directly contrary to our prime &s;uppo&s;ition, and to what hath been &s;ufficiently proved already. B has then no right to command or controul A in the u&s;e of his per&s;on and property, or to exerci&s;e any, the lea&s;t authority over him imaginable, or to put him&s;elf into any place of power or government with re&s;pect to A. And what is true of B, is &s;o of C, D, or any other; none of them have any right to the per&s;on or property of A, or A of any of them; con|&s;equently neither of them has any right to exerci&s;e any power or authority over, or to command or controul ano|ther, in the u&s;e of his per&s;on or property.</P>
<P>A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. can neither of them be in civil tru&s;t, power and authority over any other, in the whole &s;eries, of natural &s;ociety: They mu&s;t eter|nally remain in a &s;tate of nature, each one <HI>&s;ui juris</HI> un|le&s;s by mutual con&s;ent, covenant and compact, they rai&s;e &s;ome of their number, into places of public tru&s;t, power and authority, and &s;o make them rulers &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate. No man, or number of men under Heaven, has right to di&s;pute the power of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. to make them rulers, and &s;et up a civil government, if they plea&s;e, how they plea&s;e, and when they plea&s;e; or their power to inve&s;t their rulers with &s;uch authorities legi&s;lative and executive as they plea&s;e. For this would be to give this man or number of men a right to the per&s;ons of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. and to their properties too; contrary to our &s;uppo&s;ition and the truth.</P>
<P>THE people then, in every natural &s;ociety, and they only, have right natural and inherent, to &s;et up a civil
<PB N="17" REF="014036_0017_0F92ACD4D24CDC38">
Government. And this is the inherent and natural right of every tribe nation and people under heaven; they, the people only, can make a civil government, &s;et up rulers &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate, determine what laws they will be governed by, and what mode of go|vernment &s;hall take place, even that which upon tryal proves the be&s;t; to promi&s;e the mo&s;t liberty, protec|tion, peace and &s;afety to the people. If there be any people or nation upon this globe, (and I &s;hall not di&s;|pute but there is) that have not and do not exerci&s;e &s;uch right as this, this is evidently preternatural, and mere|ly accidental, or rather tyrannic and de&s;potic, contrary to rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, and abhorent from all principles of natural righteou&s;ne&s;s and equity, dreadful and into|lerable to any people, who are awake and &s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e natural rights which God hath given to all people, without any exception.</P>
<P>THESE rights of the people have been e&s;pou&s;ed, a&s;|&s;erted and vindicated in all ages of the world, as might be abundantly &s;hewn from hi&s;tory, both &s;acred and pro|fane, and the contrary principles as warmly denied and di&s;proved.</P>
<P>THE Hebrew government, as ordained of God, &s;eems to have con&s;i&s;ted of three parts or branches. For all I&s;|rael were very antiently divided into tribes, and each tribe had its own civil, as well as military officers; for there were heads of families, princes, rulers, elders and courts within each tribe. There was al&s;o a number of cho&s;en men, of chief wi&s;dom and integrity, con&s;i&s;ting of about &s;eventy per&s;ons. And la&s;tly, there was a &s;u|preme magi&s;trate, in both civil and military affairs, only &s;ubordinate to Jehovah, who was called judge, captain, &amp;c. &s;uch we find were Jo&s;hua, Gideon, Samp&s;on, Jeph|tha, &amp;c. Now the&s;e officers, heads of families, elders, &amp;c. together with the whole a&s;&s;embly or congregation of all I&s;rael, ever cho&s;e and rai&s;ed to power and authority their chief ruler, judge or Captain; never was one elected without the con&s;ent of all the people.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t note by the way, that no judge, ruler or
<PB N="18" REF="014036_0018_0F92ACD50D7C1278">
king, nor all the congregation of I&s;rael, had a proper power or authority of legi&s;lation, or making of laws, or of annulling any already made; this was a power en|tirely in the hands of Jehovah, who was I&s;rael's &s;upreme King and Legi&s;lator.</P>
<P>BUT even Jehovah him&s;elf, the &s;overeign Lord of all worlds, the great proprietor of univer&s;al nature, did not &s;ee it fit to a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf the regency and &s;u|preme civil government of I&s;rael without their con&s;ent and election of him. An everla&s;ting convincing evidence of the truth of what I have above ob&s;erved, concerning the rights of the people. Exod. xix. 3,&mdash;9. And Mo|&s;es went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him out of the mountain, &s;aying, thus &s;halt thou &s;ay to the hou&s;e of Jacob, and tell the children of I&s;rael, ye have &s;een what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles wings, and brought you unto my&s;elf. Now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you &s;hall be a peculiar trea|&s;ure unto me above all people: For all the earth is mine. And ye &s;hall be unto me a KINGDOM of prie&s;ts, and an holy NATION. The&s;e are the words which thou &s;halt &s;peak unto the children of I&s;rael. Thus Jehovah him&s;elf, when he was about to make a kingdom of I&s;|rael, and a&s;&s;ume the regency over it, in his own infinite per&s;on, propounds to them the form of the kingdom, and what they &s;hould &s;wear to be, and perform, as his loyal &s;ubjects, upon their choice of him for their poli|tic head and &s;overeign.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, Mo&s;es came and called for all the elders of I&s;rael, and laid before their faces all the&s;e words which Jehovah commanded him. Here Mo&s;es &s;ummon&s;es a parliament of all I&s;rael, calls all the princ|es of the tribes, head of families, and captains, or mi|litary officers, and the whole repre&s;entative body of the Hebrew nation, and lays before them the oath of allegi|ance; and here all I&s;rael thus repre&s;ented, &s;wore fealty to Jehovah, as their lawful &s;overeign; as it follows in the next words:
<Q>And all the people an&s;wered toge|ther
<PB N="19" REF="014036_0019_0F92ACD62D15CF20">
and &s;aid, all that Jehovah hath &s;poken we will do. And Mo&s;es returned the words of the people unto Jehovah.</Q></P>
<P>IN the government of Athens there was an a&s;&s;embly very like this of the Hebrews, which was u&s;ually called Eccle&s;ia; in which all matters of importance concerning the &s;tate, were propo&s;ed for their con&s;ideration and ap|probation or di&s;approbation, when they were lawfully &s;ummoned, as were the Hebrews here by Mo&s;es. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;t autem con&s;cio populi conventus legitime advocatus, rei alicujus publicoe cau&s;a, &s;uffragio &s;uo, aut jubendae, aut ve|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">andoe.

<P>THE Lacedemonians al&s;o had a like a&s;&s;embly or con|gregation, for like purpo&s;es, and called by the &s;ame name, Eccle&s;ia; in di&s;tinction from a le&s;&s;er congregati|on, con&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e who&s;e habitations was in the city of Sparta, (called Mikra Eccle&s;ia.)</P>
<P>SUCH were al&s;o the rights and privileges of the peo|ple in congregation, in Africa; particularly in the con|gregation of the people who went from Tyre and &s;ettled in Carthage. We may therefore very rea&s;onably con|jecture that the government of the ancient Carthageni|ans was after the Tyrian modle.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e governments of antient Greece, Italy, Africa, and A&s;ia too, may very much a&s;&s;i&s;t us to gain a right and true notion of the&s;e Hebrew a&s;&s;emblies or con|gregations; which we find had exi&s;tence in the old &s;tate of that nation, as it was modled by Mo&s;es, at the com|mand of Jehovah.</P>
<P>WHEN Jo&s;hua was to be appointed to &s;ucceed Mo&s;es, God commanded Mo&s;es to take Jo&s;hua and &s;et him be|fore the people, before Eleazer the prie&s;t, and the whole congregation, the whole repre&s;entative of the Hebrew nation, for their approbation and election. Num. xxviii, 18. And after Mo&s;es had thus propo&s;ed the matter to a legitimate a&s;&s;embly of all I&s;rael, they give their con&s;ent that Jo&s;hua &s;hould be their Judge or Captain; and when they beheld that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a like &s;pirit with Mo&s;es, and therefore that he was a fit and proper per|&s;on
<PB N="20" REF="014036_0020_0F92ACD690011B60">
to take upon him the government of I&s;rael, in &s;ub|ordination to Jehovah their &s;upreme Magi&s;trate, and in the &s;tead of Mo&s;es. Deut. xxxiv.9. And Jo&s;hua the &s;on of Nun was full of the &s;pirit of Wi&s;dom: and the children of I&s;rael hearkened unto him, and did as the Lord commanded Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>SOME great men have &s;uppo&s;ed, and perhaps not without good rea&s;on, that Saul the fir&s;t King of I&s;rael was cho&s;en by a ballot. But be that as it may, 'tis plain to every one, that Saul was made King at the free e|lection of the people. For when Samuel &s;et him before the people, and &s;aid, &s;ee ye him whom Jehovah hath cho&s;en, they all &s;houted aloud and &s;aid, God &s;ave the King. I. Sam. x.24. When &s;ome of the people ex|pre&s;&s;ed a little unea&s;ine&s;s at Saul's election, and &s;aid, how &s;hall this man &s;ave us? Samuel warns an a&s;&s;embly of all I&s;rael, to be holden at Gilgal, to &s;ee if the people could not be ea&s;ed. And the people met ac|cording to warning at Gilgal, and there they made Saul King before the Lord. I. Sam. x.27.xi.14, 15.</P>
<P>SOLOMON was anointed King by Zadoch the prie&s;t, and Nathan the prophet, at Gihon by the order of Da|vid his father. Yet notwith&s;tanding this, Solomon mu&s;t be cho&s;en and proclaimed King by the people, and therefore he is propo&s;ed to them:
<Q>And they made So|lomon the &s;on of David King the &s;econd time, and anointed him unto the Lord to be the chief Governor: And &s;o Solomon &s;at on the throne of the Lord as King in&s;tead of David his father, and pro&s;pered, and all I&s;|rael obeyed him: And all the princes and the mighty men, and all the &s;ons al&s;o of King David &s;ubmitted them&s;elves unto Solomon the King. I. Chron. xxix.22, 23, 24.</Q></P>
<P>HOW directly contrary to truth and fact, do the&s;e men talk, who &s;ay, that Kings derive their authority from God only! I a&s;&s;ert, there never was one King upon this Globe, that derived his authority from God only. Let tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert that Kings derive their authority from God only, be &s;o ingenious as to prove
<PB N="21" REF="014036_0021_0F92ACD7411E50E0">
that there ever was any one upon earth that did &s;o: Let them tell us who he was, and where he reigned. When this &s;hall be done, I will ingeniou&s;ly retract what I have &s;aid; but I mu&s;t beg leave to maintain my integrity until that time.</P>
<P>TIS true, Saul and David were nominated to the kingdom, and Jo&s;hua &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Mo&s;es, to be Judge over I&s;rael by God: But Jo&s;hua as we have &s;hown, was cho&s;en by the people. And we have not the lea&s;t rea|&s;on to think that either Saul or David would have reign|ed over I&s;rael, had they not been elected by the peo|ple. For tho' Saul had been nominated by Jehovah, to be King, and anointed by Samuel to be Captain over God's inheritance, the people of I&s;rael; yet he mu&s;t be acknowledged to be king, and proclaimed by the peo|ple; and was &s;o at Mizpeh. But &s;till, as there &s;eemed to be &s;ome little unea&s;ine&s;s among &s;ome of the people, Saul could not be &s;ettled upon the throne of I&s;rael until this unea&s;ine&s;s &s;ub&s;ided, and all the people were made quiet. Samuel therefore, who well under&s;tood the rights of the people, mu&s;t have all I&s;rael together at Gilgal, that there might be a mutual and univer&s;al con&s;ent a|mong the people, and a perfect acquie&s;cence in Saul as King.</P>
<P>AND all the people made Saul King them&s;elves, and they and he came to a mutual agreement, that he &s;hould be their King, and they his Subjects; and they re|joiced heartily together. Had it not been for this mu|tual agreement between Saul and the people, Saul might have fed his fathers a&s;&s;es to the day of his death, for any thing we know to the contrary.</P>
<P>And David tho' he was anointed to be King by Sa|muel at God's command, at Bethlehem, mu&s;t be a|nointed again, and acknowledged to be King by the people. There mu&s;t be a covenant made between Da|vid and the people, before he could mount the throne. So all the Elders of I&s;rael came to the King to Hebron; and King David made a league with them in Hebron
<PB N="22" REF="014036_0022_0F92ACD7E1632268">
before the Lord. And they anointed David King over I&s;rael. II. Sam. v.3.</P>
<P>THUS, there have been &s;ome Kings of I&s;rael made &s;o both by God and the people, yet never one by God only. And in all the nations of the earth, Kings have ever been made &s;o by the people only. Nor does God ever make a King over any people, any other ways than he does all things that are done in the univer&s;e. Ju&s;t &s;o far from truth is it to &s;ay that Kings derive their au|thority from God only, as to a&s;&s;ert a thing to have cer|tainly been, which certainly never had exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THAT all nations have ever looked upon them&s;elves to have a natural and undoubted right to make their own Kings, is evident from the&s;e two things, that they have ever a&s;&s;erted and claimed &s;uch right; and becau&s;e they always groaned and uttered bitter complaints when they could not enjoy and exerci&s;e &s;uch right.</P>
<P>CICERO de Offic. l. 2. as I find, is thus tran&s;lated by Sir Roger L'E&s;trange, p. 101, 102. Heroclotus tells us, that the Medians cho&s;e their Kings originally for the probity of their manners, and in hopes of enjoying the benefits of common ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>IN the kingdom of Per&s;ia, after the junction of the kingdoms of Media and Per&s;ia, which was as much of a monarchy as any almo&s;t in tho&s;e times, the Nobility and Governors of provinces, the repre&s;entative body of that nation, &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves to have right to make their Kings, change &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, rai&s;e up whom they would to royal dignity, &amp;c. &amp;c. did actually exerci&s;e &s;uch powers when the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne did not plea&s;e them, or was not for the good and happi|ne&s;s of the kingdom. This is evident from many in|&s;tances in the hi&s;tory of that kingdom. To cite but one at this time. After the death of Artaxerxes, the Nobi|lity and Governors of provinces, who were di&s;gu&s;ted exceedingly with the cruelty and wretched management of Sogdianus, revolted from him, and went over to Ochus, and having put the royal liara upon his head,
<PB N="23" REF="014036_0023_0F92ACD89C3947E0">
declared him King. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prid. Connect. Vol. II. <HI>580.</HI> to this effect.</NOTE> This did the Nobility and Go|vernors of Provinces, for the good of the kingdom of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>THERE was a general council gathered in all the &s;tates and free cities of Greece, in which was lodged a power of choo&s;ing their own Kings, as well as command|ers in war, as any one may find if he will. This is evi|dent from what Alexander did after the death of his fa|ther Philip, for he &s;ummoned this very council, and pro|cured to be cho&s;en by them, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his father in the &s;ame command.</P>
<P>EVERY one that knows ever &s;o little about their hi&s;|tory, knows that all the civil and military officers, both &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate, in the Roman &s;tate, were cho|&s;en by the &s;uffrages of the &s;enate and people of Rome, and the army.</P>
<P>CAESAR and Tacitus de&s;cribe the antient Britons to have been a fierce people; zealous of liberty: a free people; not like the Gauls, governed by laws made by great men; but by the people. In Cae&s;ar's time they cho&s;e Capivallaunces, and afterwards Cara&s;tacus, Arvira|gus, Galgacus, and others, to command them in their wars, but they retained the government in them&s;elves.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lord Sommers, <HI>45.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>IN the beginning of the 5th century, when the empe|ror Honorius reigned, the Romans withdrew from the i&s;land of Britain, and left it, carrying away with them all the forces, and leaving the kingdom open to the inva&s;ions and ravages of the Picts and Scots; upon which the Bri|tons elected &s;everal Kings one after another, who were depo&s;ed almo&s;t as &s;oon as cho&s;en; till finally they cho&s;e Vortigern, who reigned a long time. Such was their zeal for liberty, and &s;o tenacious were the worthy ance&s;|tors of the pre&s;ent Britons of their darling rights and pri|vileges, that when the Saxons who had been invited over by them, found means to quarrel with them, and made an entire conque&s;t of the whole kingdom, except Wales and Cornwall, they fled thither for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ty, and would not

be &s;ubjected, as to the main part of them, to tyrannic and de&s;potic power.</P>
<P>MONSIEUR Meveray, as I find him quoted, gives this account of the manners and powers of the ancient Ger|mans. There were, if I mi&s;take not, three &s;orts of go|vernment among the Germans. In &s;ome places the peo|ple had the principal authority, and yet they often elected a Prince or a King; &s;ometimes a General whom we call Duke, from the Latin word <HI>Dux.</HI> But the power of the&s;e chiefs de&s;cended entirely on the community, or people; &s;o that it was always a mixed democracy. In other parts, among the Gothones, the King's reigned with more power; yet not to the detriment of liberty; their royalty was limited by laws and the rea&s;on of things. As for li|berty, no people were ever &s;o jealous of it, or ever defend|ed it &s;o long, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully as the Germans,</P>
<P>IT may indeed be &s;aid, that liberty, being driven out of the be&s;t part of the world by the Roman arms, took refuge on the further &s;ide of the Rhine; where &s;he had for her companions and guards, poverty, innocence, fru|gality and mode&s;ty; and where, in the fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of woods and mora&s;&s;es, &s;ometimes on the defen&s;ive, and &s;ometimes making couragious &s;allies, &s;he combatted five hundred years together, again&s;t tyranny and all her train; I mean ambition, luxury, voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, flattery, corruption and divi&s;ions; the in&s;truments which that cruel enemy of the human race employs to forge manacles and fetters.</P>
<P>THUS in ancient Pale&s;tine, Media, Per&s;ia, Tyre, Afri|ca, Greece, Rome, Briton and Germany, the people con|&s;idered them&s;elves as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the rights and privileges of choo&s;ing their own rulers and officers &s;upreme and &s;ub|ordinate, civil and military. The&s;e great and ine&s;tima|ble rights they viewed as the free donation of God and nature, and u&s;ed them in the general: and when they were not prevented by tyrannic and de&s;potic powers, by inva&s;ions and conque&s;ts, which they could not avoid, and under which they &s;uffered and mourned &s;o long as they la&s;ted. And thus we find that hi&s;tory both &s;acred and profane e&s;tabli&s;hes this truth, that tho&s;e principles have
<PB N="25" REF="014036_0025_0F92ACDA191CD540">
generally been wrought into practice in the kingdoms and nations of the earth, which nature and her God have &s;o deeply laid, and on which the darling rights and privi|leges of the people depend, and by which they are &s;up|ported.</P>
<P>'TIS very true, Jehovah is the intelligent and glorious author of nature, and the natural governor of the univer&s;e, and none can di&s;pute his authority to deal with kingdoms and their Kings as he &s;hall plea&s;e; he may &s;et up one, and pull down on other at his will; he may rai&s;e to re|gal dignity and honour the men whom he chu&s;es, and dethrone others at his &s;upreme good plea&s;ure. But 'tis as true, that he never yet &s;aw fit, in his infinite wi&s;dom and coun&s;els, to u&s;e this his undoubted power: he never hath, in all the ages and generations of men upon the earth, &s;et up one King over any people or nation of his own entire authority, and without the voluntary election of that people or nation. He hath, both in his word and his providence, always allowed the people a voice in all elections of their civil and military officers and rulers. This liberty he allowed to that people whom he cho&s;e in a peculiar &s;en&s;e, to be their God, and al&s;o their Saviour and Deliverer. Nor would he him&s;elf a&s;&s;ume the regen|cy and government of that favoured people, without their con&s;ent and free election. For when he was about to take upon him&s;elf the kingly office, and to pre&s;ide over I&s;rael as their politic head and legi&s;lator he gave com|mandment to Mo&s;es to lay the matter before the people, and to acquaint them with his de&s;ign; to &s;hew them the terms of the covenant, or political league which they were to make, for their future government under his &s;upreme authority. I&s;rael in full parliament a&s;&s;embled &s;olemnly declare their con&s;ent to the&s;e terms, and &s;wear allegiance to Jehovah as their King, and thus he became &s;eated upon the throne of I&s;rael. And this &s;ame Jehovah who was thus cho&s;en him&s;elf, and &s;eated upon the throne of I&s;rael by the people, hath ordered it &s;o in his pro|vidence, that people and nations have generally enjoyed their natural rights in this re&s;pect, that they have made
<PB N="26" REF="014036_0026_0F92ACDB1300D288">
their own Kings, tho' he hath &s;ometimes for wi&s;e and holy ends, permitted tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion to rivet their hateful and galling chains upon the necks of the people, to the detriment of the&s;e natural rights and privileges.</P>
<P>THOSE men who can plead that Kings derive their authority and right to reign over the people from God on|ly, are either gro&s;sly ignorant, and &s;o ought not to &s;ay any thing about this matter; or they can plead for any thing, ju&s;t as it &s;hall coincide with their particular hu|mours, or their de&s;potic principles; and &s;o are not worthy to be heard, tho' they &s;ay ever &s;o much, by any man who has a &s;acred regard to truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, natural ju&s;tice and equity.</P>
<P>WE may, I humbly think, conclude that our propo|&s;ition is true, and that a people have a natural and inhe|rent right to appoint and con&s;titute a King &s;upreme, and all &s;ubordinate civil officers and rulers over them, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and &s;afety.</P>
<P>THUS having &s;hewn the people's powers and privi|leges in entering into civil &s;tate, in con&s;tituting a King a &s;upreme ruler, and all in &s;ubordination to him in civil tru&s;t and power: I pa&s;s,</P>
<P N="2">II. TO SHEW what are the duties and obligations of a King erected by the people, as he ought to be, and of all &s;ubordinate civil rulers and officers.</P>
<P>KINGS and people, rulers and ruled, are co-relatives, and the relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, nece&s;&s;arily in|fers, or &s;uppo&s;es &s;everal duties mutually incumbent up|on them: Duties incumbent upon Kings and rulers to|wards the people, and tho&s;e over whom and for whom they rule; and likewi&s;e duties incumbent upon the peo|ple, tho&s;e who are ruled, towards their Kings, and all who rule over them. My immediate bu&s;ine&s;s is, to &s;hew what are the &s;everal duties incumbent upon the Kings and all civil rulers towards the people, and tho&s;e over whom and for whom they rule. And here I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to mention all the duties and obligations lying upon Kings and all civil rulers towards the people, but
<PB N="27" REF="014036_0027_0F92ACDF5C248760">
&s;hall content my&s;elf with mentioning &s;ome of the more important and obvious of them.</P>
<P>THESE more important and obvious duties and obli|gations lying upon Kings and all civil rulers and officers, you have in the following propo&s;itions and rea&s;onings.</P>
<P N="1">I. KINGS and all civil rulers and officers are obliged and bound to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours in the due ex|ertion of that power, and the fulfilment of that tru&s;t repo&s;ited with them, to defend and &s;ecure to the people the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties.</P>
<P>BY properties of the people I mean, all tho&s;e worldly goods, e&s;tates and chattles which they have gotten by their hone&s;t labour, indu&s;try and frugality; together with all tho&s;e ju&s;t privileges and advantages they have to acquire more by labour, indu&s;try, trade, com|merce, manufactures, &amp;c. Now, that Kings and all ci|vil rulers and officers are obliged and bound to defend and &s;ecure to the people the quiet and unmole&s;ted en|joyment of their per&s;ons, and the&s;e properties is a plain truth, and very ea&s;ily made evident to every one.</P>
<P>THIS is a plain truth, becau&s;e this is the very end and de&s;ign, or at lead one very principal end and de&s;ign, of their being, as civil rulers. The people really de&s;ign|ed when they rai&s;ed them to places of public tru&s;t and authority, that they &s;hould exert all that power and au|thority they gave them, to defend and &s;ecure to them the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties; <HI>i. e.</HI> of their per&s;ons and all their worldly goods, e&s;tates and chattles, which they had gotten by fatigue, labour and indu&s;try; and al&s;o of all tho&s;e pri|vileges and advantages which they ju&s;tly had to get more worldly goods, and greater e&s;tates; &s;uch as labour, in|du&s;try, trade, commerce, &amp;c. This I &s;ay was one ve|ry principal de&s;ign the people had in view, when they rai&s;ed &s;ome men to places of public tru&s;t and authority, and entered into civil e&s;tate, and civil, mutual covenants, compacts and a&s;&s;ociations. 'Tis very plain in rea&s;on, and even in common &s;en&s;e, that this mu&s;t be one main
<PB N="28" REF="014036_0028_0F92ACE15931AD30">
end, one principal de&s;ign at lea&s;t, (for I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew they mu&s;t have had others) which the people had a view to, when they entered into civil &s;tate, and made them civil rulers, and gave them the civil &s;word, with proper power and authority to wield it. And this may appear mo&s;t evidently thus. Suppo&s;e A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. a large number of people in neighbourhood together, in &s;ome part of this globe; and to have acquired by hone&s;t labour, indu&s;try, frugality and com|merce with one another, very con&s;iderable e&s;tates; and to be under very good advantages to get more e&s;tate and worldly goods, if they could live quietly and peaceably in the enjoyment of their per&s;ons and pre&s;ent acqui&s;iti|ons, and of tho&s;e advantages they are now under to ac|quire more. But the injury and violence offered their per&s;ons, and the continual ravages and depredations made upon their e&s;tates, by neighbouring nations and people dwelling upon the continent, and even beyond the &s;eas, prevent them both from the enjoyment of their per&s;ons in peace and quiet, and what acqui&s;itions they have already made, and al&s;o from tho&s;e future ac|qui&s;itions which an unmole&s;ted enjoyment of their ad|vantages would a&s;&s;i&s;t them to make.</P>
<P>They find them&s;elves under fatal nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uffering the like injuries and depredations for the future, in the circum&s;tances they are now in, being in a &s;tate of nature, and having no one, or more, of &s;uperior power and au|thority among them, to coun&s;el and advi&s;e to mea&s;ures proper to be taken by them, and to lead forth their united force, by his or their command, to oppo&s;e and &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch troublers of their peace and quiet, and injurers of their per&s;ons and properties; to prevent their making &s;uch ravages, and committing &s;uch injuries for the future or to make repri&s;als for tho&s;e already committed. And thus they become very &s;en&s;ible of the impo&s;&s;ibility of their living together in &s;uch a &s;ituation with any tolerably de|gree of quiet, &s;afety or &s;ecurity, either to their per&s;ons or properties; and of the nece&s;&s;ity of making an e&s;&s;enti|al alteration in their mode of living. They are now per|&s;uaded
<PB N="29" REF="014036_0029_0F92ACE365634DE8">
that they mu&s;t choo&s;e &s;ome per&s;ons from among their numbers, and rai&s;e them to places of &s;uperior tru&s;t and authority, and inve&s;t them with powers, &s;uch as &s;hall tend to their benefit, to the effectual &s;ecurity, de|fence and protection of their per&s;ons and properties, from all &s;uch injuries, foreign inva&s;ions, and depredations, as they have too &s;en&s;ibly &s;uffered.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. meet to|gether in a general a&s;&s;embly, confer upon their pre&s;ent great unhappine&s;s in &s;uch a &s;ituation; and the probabi|lity that it will &s;till continue or grow greater, if they &s;hould remain thus. They finally unanimou&s;ly agree to an alteration of their pre&s;ent manner of living, and to the election of a civil &s;tate and government, and the mak|ing civil compacts and leagues, and effectually entering into a politic &s;ociety; and the&s;e for their civil good, li|berty, protection, peace and &s;afety, in the enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties without injury and ruptures. To effect which &s;alutary purpo&s;es and de&s;igns, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. take out of their number, by general votes, or &s;uffrages, L, M, N, O, P, &amp;c. &s;uch as they judge to be eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wi&s;dom, equity, pro|bity, and public &s;pirit, qualifying them for the impor|tant and intere&s;ting bu&s;ine&s;s of legi&s;lation and execution, and all the great and weighty affairs of civil govern|ment. Of the&s;e men they make rulers and officers of &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate authority, and to the&s;e they de|legate a power to make and execute, from time to time, all &s;uch laws, orders and &s;tatutes, as &s;hall be, in their be&s;t judgment, and upon proper experiment of them, the mo&s;t proper and fit to promote the general good and utility; and to &s;ettle and maintain them in the quiet and ju&s;t en|joyment of their per&s;ons and properties. Always pro|vided they retain a right and power to choo&s;e a &s;ufficient number from among them&s;elves, to be a repre&s;entative body of the whole people, to &s;it in council with tho&s;e they now elect into places of public tru&s;t and authority; and to have a voice in the making all &s;uch laws, as above,
<PB N="30" REF="014036_0030_0F92ACE483078B10">
and in the management of all the mo&s;t weighty concerns of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>MANY and powerful rea&s;ons might ea&s;ily be given, if it were required in this place, why any people have right and why it is a point of con&s;ummate wi&s;dom and pru|dence for them, always to have &s;uch a repre&s;entative bo|dy from among the commons, to &s;it in council with their rulers, and to have a voice in legi&s;lation. But as it is not required in this place, and is not it&s;elf a matter of the greate&s;t conte&s;t or difference, I &s;hall not make u&s;e of this time to give the rea&s;ons for it, but &s;hall willingly pa&s;s it in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Now I a&s;k, are not L, M, N, O, P, &amp;c. thus elected by the people, and rai&s;ed by A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. to places of public tru&s;t and power, &s;olemnly bound and obliged, on &s;uppo&s;ition they accept of the&s;e places and this civil tru&s;t and authority, to defend and &s;ecure A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. and every individual member of this &s;ociety, now a body politic, in the enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties in peace and quiet? are they not obliged to defend and &s;ecure the people in the unmole&s;t|ed enjoyment of their rights, privileges, advantages and emoluments which God and nature have given them? I freely appeal to rea&s;on and the nature of things; I ap|peal to common &s;en&s;e; I appeal mo&s;t heartily to every one who is capable to read and under&s;tand what I write, whether this be not &s;o.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY every man mu&s;t be con&s;idered as under obligations to do what he mo&s;t voluntarily covenants and engages to do; but every King, every civil ruler, when they con&s;ent to be &s;uch, in con&s;equence of the free elec|tion and &s;uffrage of the people, do, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> engage and covenant to u&s;e their &s;uperior power and authority to pro|mote the people's good, peace and happine&s;s, and to do their utmo&s;t to &s;ecure and defend their per&s;ons and properties.</P>
<P>'Tis a well known practice, in all countries, and among all nations, where King's are elective, to u&s;e &s;ome &s;olemn form of inauguration, in which the King &s;wears to rule
<PB N="31" REF="014036_0031_0F92ACE4B9A63590">
the people by whole&s;ome laws; and to abide by the &s;ta|tute laws, and the Magna Charta of the kingdom, in all tho&s;e laws to which he &s;hall give his royal a&s;&s;ent. I have no objection to make again&s;t this. But I really &s;uppo&s;e that a King, when he accepts of the regency, upon his election to it by the people, does, by this very acceptance, lay him&s;elf under &s;olemn obligations to rule the people by whole&s;ome laws, and to do all in his power to make them happy. For he knows that their happi|ne&s;s is the de&s;ign they have in view, in electing him into place of royal dignity and authority. How gro&s;s and dete&s;table would be his hypocri&s;y, if he &s;hould accept of regal power and place, upon the voluntary election of the people, and yet not &s;incerely de&s;ign to promote their good and happine&s;s, in &s;uch exalted &s;tations of life and actions! every King is bound to make the people's good his Magna Charta, in all his admini&s;trations.</P>
<P N="2">2. KINGS, and all civil rulers, are under obligations to defend and &s;ecure the people in the wor&s;hip of the Deity, and the due ob&s;ervation of religion in publick; and even to exert their power and authority to oblige the people to attend upon the public wor&s;hip of God.</P>
<P>I am writing and &s;peaking in a land where the true God is known and revered, and the religion of Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Me&s;&s;ias is generally acknowledged.</P>
<P>L, M, N, O P, &amp;c. are not only under obligations to defend and &s;ecure the people in the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties, i. e. their per|&s;ons and wordly goods and e&s;tates, &amp;c. together with all their ju&s;t advantages and opportunies of getting more worldly goods, e&s;tates, &amp;c. by labour, indu&s;try, trade, manufactures, &amp;c. but they are al&s;o under obligations to protect and &s;ecure the people in the wor&s;hip of the Deity; and even to exert their power and authority to oblige the people to attend upon the public wor&s;hip of God with con&s;tancy and all becoming decency.</P>
<P>CIVIL magi&s;trates ought to con&s;ider that the people have &s;ouls as well as bodies, immortal as well as tempo|ral intere&s;ts: and that they expect that tho&s;e men whom
<PB N="32" REF="014036_0032_0F92ACE55AB96288">
they elevate into places of di&s;tinction, tru&s;t and dignity, &s;hould have &s;ome regard to their &s;uperior intere&s;t as well as to their inferior, to their eternal as well as temporal concerns. They mo&s;t ju&s;tly expect that their rulers fa|vour, cheri&s;h, protect and defend them, at lea&s;t whil&s;t they wor&s;hip the divinity, and attend upon religion in &s;uch manner, as is no wi&s;e detrimental, but greatly be|neficial to the civil &s;tate; and certainly for the promoti|on of their everla&s;ting account with God.</P>
<P>I do not mean that the civil magi&s;trate, as &s;uch, or purely becau&s;e he is elevated above the people in his civil capacity, &s;hould therefore exert him&s;elf in the church, or have a chief care in managing the affairs of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e: by no means does this belong to his character as a civil magi&s;trate. The &s;uperior character and authority of a civil magi&s;trate, in the politic &s;tate, give him no &s;u|perior power or authority in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate. But I do really mean that the civil magi&s;trate, as a man, as one bound for immortality, and even as a man elevated, and in honor and dignity, and one who is truely concern|ed for the eternal welfare of the people, is under very great obligations to promote, nouri&s;h, defend and &s;ecure all reverential wor&s;hip of God, and decent ob&s;ervation of religion, both natural and revealed. Thus much I &s;up|po&s;e the civil magi&s;trate is obliged to do, in order to pro|mote the wor&s;hip of the Deity, &amp; for the due encourage|ment of religion in general. But I &s;ay further, the civil magi&s;trate, as &s;uch, or purely becau&s;e he is in the magi&s;|&s;tracy is under obligations to exert his power and autho|ty to oblige the people to a due and regular and con&s;tant attendance upon the public wor&s;hip of the church.</P>
<P>If the civil magi&s;trate be under obligations to defend and &s;ecure to the people the enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties, in peace and quietne&s;s, which every one will readily grant, then he is under obligations to do tho&s;e things which have a direct &amp; natural tendency to promote this their enjoyment; and indeed the&s;e are very nearly the &s;ame thing. For to bring any thing into effect, and to do tho&s;e things which have a natural and direct tenden|cy
<PB N="33" REF="014036_0033_0F92ACE6398AD1D8">
to &s;uch effect, are very nearly the &s;ame thing: cer|tainly there is as much relation between them, as be|tween the means and the end effected by tho&s;e means. And it may be the ca&s;e, that civil magi&s;trates may be in|capable to do any more, than to u&s;e the be&s;t and mo&s;t likely means to make the &s;tate flouri&s;h, and the peo|ple happy. But &s;urely, in all chri&s;tian countries, a con|&s;tant, due and regular attendance upon the wor&s;hip in public a&s;&s;emblies, where the great fundamental princi|ples truths and duties of natural religion are &s;kilfully taught and inculcated upon the people, and where the re|ligion of Me&s;&s;ias, in its genuine purity and &s;implicity, is preached, and its va&s;t importance clearly and wi&s;ely &s;hewn, I &s;ay, a con&s;tant and regular attendance upon this wor&s;hip and &s;ervice is for the civil good of the people, and an un&s;peakable advantage to every politic &s;tate. For in the church the people are taught their duty to God and the king, and there the mo&s;t powerful arguments and motives are pre&s;ented to their minds, to prevail with and per&s;uade them to a &s;uitable conduct towards both. More powerful and weighty arguments and motives may people receive from the de&s;k than from the bench or the bar, the pri&s;on or the gallows, to per&s;uade them to ren|der all becoming obedience to civil magi&s;trates. Per|haps one orthodox or faithful preacher of religion may do more real &s;ervice, even to the civil &s;tate, than two faithful ju&s;tices of the peace, in each particular &s;ociety or pari&s;h. For if the arguments fetched from the un&s;een &s;tate, if the eternal joys and everla&s;ting torments of an heaven and a hell, when prudently handled, and &s;criptu|rally repre&s;ented to the people, will not prevail with them to render due honours and wor&s;hip to the great God, and his eternal &s;on, or to pay proper obedience and meet &s;ub|jection to kings and civil magi&s;trates; 'tis very improba|ble that any thing which they can do will be effectual to per&s;uade them to behave well in the civil &s;tate. If all preachers of religion &s;hould be di&s;countenanced, and all public a&s;&s;emblies for the wor&s;hip of the Deity cea&s;e, in any chri&s;tian country, there would be no &s;uch thing as
<PB N="34" REF="014036_0034_0F92ACE6D58CC4F8">
holding the people together in civil &s;ociety, and all civil government would pre&s;ently be di&s;&s;olved; and anarchy and confu&s;ion, athei&s;m and barbarity, and a di&s;mal train of evils would &s;oon make inroads upon the people, to their certain ruin.</P>
<P>MAGISTRATES are therefore obliged on politic princi|ples, to defend &amp; maintain the public wor&s;hip of the Deity, and a con&s;tant and regular ob&s;ervation of religion in public. Yea, the very &s;ame arguments that may be u&s;ed to prove that civil magi&s;trates are bound to defend and &s;ecure to the people the enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties, as one great de&s;ign and end of their being, as civil magi&s;trates may be al&s;o u&s;ed to prove that they are obliged and bound to defend and maintain the public wor&s;hip of the Deity, and a due ob&s;ervation of religion among the people. Therefore, if any one a&s;k me, whe|ther I would have the magi&s;trate make u&s;e of the civil &s;word, in order to oblige the people to attend con&s;tantly and regularly upon public wor&s;hip, if nothing el&s;e will do this? I readily an&s;wer, I would, by all means. I really look upon the civil magi&s;trate to be under as great obligations to u&s;e the civil &s;word, or to exert his authori|ty, to oblige the people to pay a con&s;tant attendance upon public wor&s;hip, as he is to u&s;e the civil &s;word, or to exert his authority, to oblige the people to do any thing el&s;e, that can po&s;&s;ibly be named, of equal advantage to the civil &s;tate.</P>
<P>THUS 'tis proved that civil magi&s;trates are under obli|gations to defend and &s;ecure the people in the wor&s;hip of the Deity; and even to u&s;e the civil &s;word, or exert their authority, to maintain a public ob&s;ervation of religion.</P>
<P N="3">3. KINGS, and all civil magi&s;trates are mo&s;t &s;olemnly and forever bound to make all their laws agreeing with truth and rea&s;on, the laws of God and the nature of things.</P>
<P>THOUGH L, M, N, O, P, &amp;c. are ever &s;o &s;olemnly bound and obliged to defend and &s;ecure A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. in the quiet and unmole&s;ted enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties, and all their natural and ju&s;t

rights and privileges; and al&s;o to maintain the wor&s;hip of the Deity, and the public ob&s;ervation of religion a|mong them: yet they cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed obliged to make or execute any one law, for the&s;e or any other pur|po&s;es of the &s;tate, which contradicts truth, or counteracts any of the maxims and laws of rea&s;on and the nature of things, which are the laws of God. For 'tis ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that any &s;uch laws can be binding upon the people, if made. And A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. when they entered into civil &s;tate, and choo&s;e &s;ome of their number to be their civil rulers, did not oblige tho&s;e whom they thus elected into places of tru&s;t and autho|rity, to make or execute any laws which did not tend to promote, or had a tendency to ob&s;truct the enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties and religion; nor did tho&s;e con&s;equently, who con&s;ented to be civil magi&s;trates upon the election of the people, oblige them&s;elves to any &s;uch thing. For to &s;uppo&s;e either of the&s;e would be the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdity and contradiction. But it is now, ever hath been, and will continue to be a t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">th, to the con|&s;ummation of all things, that for civil magi&s;trates to make or execute any laws repugnant to truth and rea|&s;on, to the laws of God and the nature of things, will not only be no furtherence but the greate&s;t detriment to all civil &s;tates what&s;oever. It cannot be otherwi&s;e therefore, than that all civil magi&s;trates are &s;olemnly and forever obliged and bound to make and execute &s;uch laws only as are agreeable with their tru&s;t and rea&s;on, the laws of God and the nature of things; for &s;uch only will tend to the peace and happine&s;s of all civil &s;tates.</P>
<P>WHEN I &s;ay that civil magi&s;trates are obliged to make and execute laws agreeing with the laws of God, I do not mean to maintain or even to &s;ugge&s;t, that they are &s;crupulou&s;ly to abide by the declarations of the bible, in all the laws they make; nor do I &s;uppo&s;e that the bible was de&s;igned by God for a code of civil laws, or to be the magna charta of any nation under heaven. 'Tis true the civil laws of the Jewi&s;h nation are principally con|tained in the writings of Mo&s;es, and in the old te&s;tament.
<PB N="36" REF="014036_0036_0F92ACE88C275018">
But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that even the&s;e did not continue to bind the Hebrews, any longer than while Jehovah was their politic head and &s;overeign; and that they do not, nor ever did, bind any other nation, any further than the rea&s;on of them is founded in nature, and &s;o renders them of eternal obligation to all mankind who are acquainted with them. But what I mean is, that no laws are to be made, or enforced, which are contradictory to laws, in&s;ti|tutions, and plain declarations of the bible which are of natural and eternal obligation.</P>
<P>Ex. Gr. laws to endemnify murderers, banditti, thieves, traitors, &s;acriligious per&s;ons, &amp;c. &s;uch laws would be contradictory to truth, which requires that every per&s;on &amp; thing be treated according to what it really is. Di&s;a|greeing with rea&s;on, which ever coincides with truth, and even impolitic, as tending to the &s;peedy ever&s;ion and ruin of all civil government and authority what&s;oever. Repugnant to God's laws in his bible, to tho&s;e of them which are of natural, and &s;o con&s;equently of eternal obli|gation. And contrary to the nature of the thing's taking place in every civil &s;tate, as well as in the great world of nature and providence; which requires that civil puni&s;h|ments &s;hould be inflicted on tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors again&s;t the civil &s;tate, bearing proportion to their crimes; and that no delinquent, ever e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed.</P>

<P>WHILST kings, and civil rulers of all degrees of power and importance, fulfil their tru&s;t, and act a|greeable to their obligations to the people, there are ma|ny obligations and duties lying upon the people, which they are &s;olemnly bound to ob&s;erve and fulfil, with all care and fidelity to their rulers.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;ome of the more important of the&s;e duties and obligations of the people in civil &s;tate are, towards their civil rulers, whil&s;t they fulfil their tru&s;t and an&s;wer their obligations to them, you may take in the following propo&s;itions and conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE people are bound in duty and intere&s;t to yield all due obedience to their civil rulers, both &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate, whil&s;t they are endeavouring to promote their good.</P>
<P>IT was the very de&s;ign of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. in entering into civil &s;tate, and making them ci|vil rulers, in choo&s;ing men from their number, who were famed for wi&s;dom, probity and public &s;pirit, to promote, defend and &s;ecure the public peace, tranqui|lity and happine&s;s, by the exerci&s;e of their &s;uperior wi&s;|dom, power and authority. Their wi&s;dom to contrive, and their power and authority to put in execution, all
<PB N="38" REF="014036_0038_0F92ACEE524A9A18">
their noi&s;e, and judicious projections and plans for the&s;e noble and generous purpo&s;es and de&s;igns. But civil rulers may rack their inventions, and exerci&s;e their wi&s;|dom ever &s;o much, and lay the happie&s;t projects and &s;chemes for the general utility, peace and pro&s;perity of the people; yet if the people will not a&s;&s;i&s;t their rulers and legi&s;lators in the execution of the&s;e projects and &s;chemes, by yielding a ready and chearful obedience to their directions and commands, the ends and de&s;igns of the people and the rulers in the&s;e projections, cannot be accompli&s;hed. The general good, peace and happine&s;s of the people, intended by them and their rulers too, can never be attained. For it is by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the people that civil rulers bring into effect their wi&s;e plans of government; and &s;o, if they be virtuous, wi&s;e and good rulers, as is the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, effectuate the de&s;igns and purpo&s;es of the people in entering into civil &s;tate and combination, even the general emolument, liberty and &s;e|curity. Therefore if the people will not a&s;&s;i&s;t their rul|ers and legi&s;lators, by yielding a ready and chearful o|bedience to their commands and requirements, in order that government may be maintained, by bringing into execution tho&s;e plans and projections which proceeded from the &s;uperior wi&s;dom, integrity and public &s;pirit of the magi&s;trates and law-givers, and which tend to effect the public tranquility, and to promote the liberty, peace and happine&s;s of the &s;tate; they certainly counteract their own purpo&s;es and de&s;igns, and hinder tho&s;e things from taking effect, which they determined with them|&s;elves &s;hould take effect, when they entered into civil &s;tate, and con&s;tituted civil rulers and officers in it. So that it is very plain, that duty and intere&s;t both oblige the people to yield a ready and chearful obedience to all the wi&s;e and whole&s;ome laws directions and commands of their civil rulers and officers.</P>
<P>CIVIL officers and executors of the laws of the ma|gi&s;tracy, are &s;olemnly bound to exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t within their &s;everal &s;pheres of action, to put all &s;uch laws as are calculated for the general good and hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="39" REF="014036_0039_0F92ACEE8DB92F00">
of the &s;tate, into execution. They &s;hould &s;ee to it with care, that they fulfil this tru&s;t, and do what in them is, what really belongs to their &s;everal depart|ments, to promote the general utility, peace and li|berty of the whole. And the people are al&s;o obliged to give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the executors of laws, and to forward them in bringing into execution the laws and orders of the magi&s;trates and legi&s;lators for the univer|&s;al intere&s;t of the civil &s;tate.</P>
<P>THUS, if legi&s;lators and magi&s;trates make wi&s;e and whole&s;ome laws, which tend to the general good and happine&s;s; and if the officers and executors of the&s;e laws fulfil, with great care and fidelity, their tru&s;t, by endeavouring to bring the&s;e laws into execution; and finally, if the people chearfully give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to the&s;e officers and executors of laws, and thus yield a ready obedience to their civil rulers; the &s;tate will certainly flouri&s;h; peace, tranquility and happine&s;s will en&s;ue, e|very one will, mo&s;t likely, enjoy his per&s;on, property and religion in undi&s;turbed quiet; and a univer&s;al joy and gladne&s;s will reign throughout the whole community, and all will experience the &s;alutary effects of civil &s;oci|ety and combination. But if otherwi&s;e, an ob&s;truction of the proge&s;s of ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s will follow, to the inevitable ruin of the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE people are bound to pay a &s;uitable re&s;pect to their civil rulers, and to maintain their honour, dignity and reputation in the &s;tate, and among all their &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>EVERY one may ea&s;ily imagine that honour, dignity and reputation will have a mighty influence upon the people, who&s;e civil rulers &s;hare largely in them. No people will very much regard tho&s;e rulers who have little or no reputation among them, but are had in very low e&s;teem. Love and re&s;pect for civil rulers will do more to gain them obedience from the people, than the power of the &s;word can po&s;&s;ibly do. The &s;word and the power civil rulers have to wield it may de&s;troy, maim, and take away the lives of &s;ubjects; but they will never gain the love and cordial affections of the people, like honour and
<PB N="40" REF="014036_0040_0F92ABC7976AB488">
e&s;teem, and con&s;equently not their ready and chearful obedience. The former may, and undoubtedly do, make a great many political hypocrites, but few cordial and loyal &s;ubjects. It will be hard work, and a forbidding ta&s;k, for civil rulers to pre&s;s their way through, and gain obedience to their laws and mandates, from a people who&s;e hearts and hands are no further with them, than mere force and con&s;traint, the power of the &s;word, and the awful dread of the whip, the pri&s;on and the gallows compel them. But love, e&s;teem, and veneration for ci|vil rulers will &s;weetly con&s;train the people to yield a dutiful compliance with all tho&s;e laws and injunctions of the magi&s;trates, which are calculated for the general benefit of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t then be the incumbent duty of all the people, to endeavour that the honour and reputation of civil rulers and magi&s;trates be maintained among the &s;ubjects. For we have ob&s;erved before, that it is for the general good, peace, &s;afety, liberty and happine&s;s of the community, that civil government is ever &s;et up among a people, and civil leagues, compacts and combinations entered into by them. But the&s;e things can never be effected, the good, peace, &s;afety, &amp;c. of the community will never be brought about, unle&s;s there be a free and impartial exer|ci&s;e of ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s among the people. And this cannot be; a free and impartial exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s can never take place, unle&s;s good and whole&s;ome laws for this purpo&s;e can be brought into ex|ecution among the people. Nor can this be done; laws, though ever &s;o wi&s;ely calculated for the univer&s;al good, peace, &amp;c. of the community, can never be put in due execution, unle&s;s the people in general have their hearts and hands with the magi&s;trates, and will join with them in putting their laws in execution. But neither will this be unle&s;s the people honour and revere the magi&s;trates, and have them in &s;uitable e&s;teem and veneration. That magi&s;trates and civil rulers, both &s;upreme and &s;ubordi|nate, be honourable and reputable among the people, mu&s;t be concluded to be for the general utility and pro&s;|perity
<PB N="41" REF="014036_0041_0F92ABCBA3D7F2F8">
of the &s;tate; if they are wi&s;e, prudent and faithful men. Every lover of his county, and of it's liberty, peace and pro&s;perity, will do his endeavour to maintain the honour and reputation of all good civil rulers and magi&s;trates.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE people are under obligations to give their ru|lers and civil magi&s;trates a valuable reward for the &s;er|vice and work which they do for the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on and nature of things, the univer&s;al cu&s;tom and practice of all nations, and the word of God, mo&s;t plainly &s;hew it to be ju&s;t that tribute &s;hould be paid to Cae&s;ar: that King's, and all civil rulers and magi&s;trates &s;hould have a rea&s;onable reward for their faithful &s;ervice for the people. For when a people enter into civil &s;tate, and make choice of &s;ome of their number qualified to rule, and put them into places of public tru&s;t and au|thority, give them power to make and execute laws for their good and advantage, for their &s;ecurity, peace and protection in the enjoyment of their per&s;ons and proper|ties and religion; they very ju&s;tly expect that the&s;e men, whom they have made their rulers and legi&s;lators, guar|dians and protectors, &s;hould &s;pend a con&s;iderable pro|portion of their time to con&s;ult the intere&s;t of the &s;tate, to make and execute laws, to concert and pro&s;ecute the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t methods and plans of government, to &s;end and receive emba&s;&s;ies, to determine concerning peace and war with other powers and &s;tates, to &s;ettle and re|gulate trade and commerce, &amp;c. The people, I &s;ay, do expect and really look upon it as nece&s;&s;ary, that their rulers &s;hould &s;pend a great part of their time, and exer|ci&s;e their wi&s;dom and &s;kill, in the&s;e &s;ervices for the &s;tate for them.</P>
<P>NOW, if rulers and legi&s;lators are faithful to the peo|ple, their con&s;tituents, and improve their time and abi|lities for the good of the &s;tate; it is certainly highly rea|&s;onable they &s;hould have a valuable con&s;ideration for it, made them by the people for whom they &s;erve. The people are continually receiving benefits, and reaping innumerable profits and emoluments, whil&s;t their rulers
<PB N="42" REF="014036_0042_0F92ABCDA76C3190">
and magi&s;trates are diligently and faithfully employing their time and talents to protect, defend and make them happy, in the quiet and unmole&s;ted enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties, their liberties and privileges both natural and acquired. Surely they will not think it hard and unrea&s;onable, that their rulers and magi&s;trates &s;hould reap &s;ome of the&s;e profits, and ta&s;te &s;ome of the&s;e &s;weets of &s;ociety with them! yea, it would be directly contrary to truth, to rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, if they &s;hould de|ny them a hand&s;ome maintenance and &s;upport for their &s;ervices.</P>
<P>'TIS impo&s;&s;ible any men &s;hould be made civil rulers and magi&s;trates without their own con&s;ent and agree|ment: and it is altogether improbable that any number of men &s;hould con&s;ent to improve their time and talents for the advantage and in the &s;ervice of others, for no con|&s;iderable reward at all: and if they &s;hould, it is very manife&s;tly unrea&s;onable, that the people &s;hould receive their &s;ervices and labours, and reap unknown advantages and benefits by them, and in return, make them no va|luable con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>For one man to u&s;e the time and talents of another as his own, or in his own &s;ervice, and for his own purpo&s;es and de&s;igns, when they are not his own would be a plain and palpable contradiction to truth. For his actions would mo&s;t evidently declare that the time and talents of another man were his own, when indeed they were not: a gro&s;s violation of &s;acred truth! &s;o that it is a plain and open contradiction of truth, for any people to elect men into places of public tru&s;t and authority, and u&s;e them as rulers, legi&s;lators and executors, except they give them a valuable con&s;ideration for their &s;ervices. This would contradict truth al&s;o another way; for it would be a pub|lic declaration that the time and talents of tho&s;e men, whom they &s;hould elect, &amp;c. were not their own, when they really are, in nature and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>AND if any number of men &s;hould con&s;ent that their time, talents and abilities &s;hould be improved for the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, it is a plain ca&s;e to every one, that it
<PB N="43" REF="014036_0043_0F92ABCEB84BE550">
would be unrea&s;onable in the &s;tate to employ them for nothing. For every man, by the laws of nature and rea&s;on, is ju&s;tly entitled to the u&s;e and improvement of his own: if therefore he u&s;e his own powers and abilities, time and talents in the &s;ervice, and for the advantage of others, it mu&s;t be rea&s;onable that he have a reward, of tho&s;e men for whom he u&s;es them. 'Tis therefore the duty of the people, and what they are under obligations to do, to give their kings and all &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate civil rulers, a valuable reward for their &s;ervices to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>IF any one &s;hould a&s;k me, how much a king, or any other civil magi&s;trate, ought to have of the people? I would tell him, that I &s;hall be under better advantages to an&s;wer him, when he &s;hall tell me, who is the man, he would have made a king, what are his talents of mind, what his natural and acquired abilities, what are his wi&s;|dom and &s;kill in the affairs of government, of what in|tegrity, faithfulne&s;s, probity and public &s;pirit he is po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of, and what are all the circum&s;tances of his per&s;on and family, and all tho&s;e of the whole kingdom, over which he is to rule, and what are their expectations from him, &amp;c. Until all this, and perhaps much more, be done, I &s;hall freely tell &s;uch an enquirer, I am incapable to &s;olve his que&s;tion: nor can I give him much encouragement that I &s;hall be able to an&s;wer him, when he &s;hall have taken pains to give me all this information.</P>
<P>IT is evident to any man, who thinks ever &s;o little of the matter, that a great number of particulars mu&s;t be taken into con&s;ideration, in order to determine how large a king's, or magi&s;trates &s;alary ought to be. If he be a man of a capacious mind, of &s;urpri&s;ing natural and ac|quired abilities, of great &s;kill and wi&s;dom in the laws of nature and nations, if he be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of eminent piety and virtue, of great integrity, faithfulne&s;s, probity and be|nevolence, it is apparently rea&s;onable, that this man, if he would be per&s;uaded to undertake the important and intere&s;ting tru&s;t of governing, and to exerci&s;e his abili|ties, to u&s;e his time and talents for the good and benefit of the public, ought to receive a very valuable con&s;ider|ation

of the people. Becau&s;e there is the greate&s;t rea|&s;on to expect he will govern well, and make the com|munity ea&s;y and quiet, peaceable and happy, in the en|joyment of their per&s;ons, properties and religion, and all their natural rights, privileges and endowments. Where|as a man of le&s;s abilities, emoluments and qualificati|ons, for government, may very rea&s;onably be contented with a le&s;s &s;alary of the people: becau&s;e there is not the like probability that he will equally promote the intere&s;t of the civil community, by his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hall very willingly let this matter re&s;t here, without any po&s;itive deci&s;ion of mine, it being a little foreign from my pre&s;ent de&s;ign; and proceed in what is more agreeable to it.</P>

<P>IF any people therefore wi&s;h for the pro&s;perity of the civil &s;tate, and de&s;ire that the ea&s;e and pains, la|bours and &s;ervices, of the civil rulers, may be &s;uc|ce&s;sful for this purpo&s;e, let them &s;ee to it, that they &s;incerely and faithfully perform their duty to their rulers, and pray with all becoming decency, reverence and fer|vour, for Jehovah's ble&s;&s;ing upon them.</P>
<P>THIS is not only a duty of natural light and religion, which is enough to induce an obligation for the per|formance of it, upon every &s;erious and virtuous man: But chri&s;tians mu&s;t con&s;ider, that it is an expre&s;s com|mand of in&s;piration, and found in the law of Me&s;&s;ias, that they pray for Kings, and all in authority, that, under their wi&s;e and faithful admini&s;trations, they may lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all godline&s;s and ho|ne&s;ty. Chri&s;tians are then under double obligations to perform this duty to civil magi&s;trates; obligations ari&s;|ing from the law and light of nature and rea&s;on, and receiving additional force and authority from &s;acred re|velation. One would be apt to think it an ea&s;y matter to per&s;uade a chri&s;tian people of this great obligation ly|ing upon them, to pray for Kings and all in authority.</P>
<P>BUT a people ought al&s;o to ble&s;s God for all good ci|vil rulers, &s;uch as con&s;ult his glory, and their be&s;t good and happine&s;s, and endeavour by all rea&s;onable and righteous methods of admini&s;tration, to promote the ci|vil felicity.</P>
<P>I DO not mean that a people are obligated to ble&s;s God for good rulers, as tho' they were appointed to pre&s;ide over them, and in&s;tated in their offices and digni|ties by his &s;ole authority: for I do not believe there ever was, yea, I know there never was, any one King, or civil ruler, appointed and in&s;tated in civil power, over any people under heaven, by God's &s;ole authority. And I mo&s;t firmly believe it to be contrary to rea&s;on
<PB N="46" REF="014036_0046_0F92ABD0A28D1F90">
and the nature of things, I know it to be contrary to the law of nature and nations, to &s;acred and profane hi&s;|tory, to believe or hold any &s;uch opinion, that Kings derive their authority to reign over the people from God only. I &s;hall not therefore direct any people to offer prai&s;e and thank&s;giving to God, under any &s;uch con|&s;ideration as this. But as God's providence directs the affairs of univer&s;al exi&s;tence, concerns it&s;elf for the good and happine&s;s of kingdoms and &s;tates, as it &s;uperintends all the greater and meaner events that take place in the whole &s;y&s;tem of beings, &s;o that not &s;o in&s;ignificant a thing as a &s;parrow, or even an hair of our heads, falls to the ground, without his knowledge and in&s;pection; when he, in his good and &s;uperintending providence, permits and directs to the election of wi&s;e and good Kings and civil rulers, it very highly becomes the peo|ple &s;uitably to acknowledge his hand, and to pay pro|per re&s;pect to the power that rules above, and governs in this lower world, that he hath directed them to the choice of good and faithful kings, of wi&s;e and righteous magi&s;trates. Thus much I can heartily and patheti|cally recommend to all civil communities of people, who are thus favoured in God's holy and good provi|dence, in this intere&s;ting regard.</P>
<P>I WOULD therefore, with all due engagedne&s;s, ear|ne&s;tne&s;s and fervour, recommend it to all people who have wi&s;e and faithful rulers, that they devoutly pay to the great ruler of the world, &s;uitable acknowledg|ments, for his care of, and goodne&s;s to them: and that they pray to this great being, for his ble&s;&s;ing upon them, that they may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of real piety and vir|tue, wi&s;dom and probity, and every magi&s;terial qua|lification: and that he would crown all their labours and endeavours for the public weal with abundant &s;uc|ce&s;s: that &s;o, they may be a rich and la&s;ting ble&s;&s;ing to the people over whom they rule; and the &s;tate be happy, enjoying the &s;weets of civil combination, and reli&s;hing the benefits of Heaven's indulgence. Having now fi|ni&s;hed three of tho&s;e things at fir&s;t propounded to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, I &s;hall directly pa&s;s to the con&s;ideration of the fourth and la&s;t propo&s;ition, viz.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="47" REF="014036_0047_0F92ABD16006FD68">IV. TO PROVE that the people have right and au|thority to dethrone their king, and put down all other civil officers and rulers, of &s;ubordinate degree, when|ever they &s;hall counteract their obligations, and cea&s;e to an&s;wer the ends of their con&s;titution and appoint|ment to places of civil tru&s;t and power.</P>
<P>THIS is a propo&s;ition, the truth of which is very ea|&s;ily proved and made evident, and which, it &s;eems, eve|ry man who is capable, and does &s;eriou&s;ly and impar|tially weigh the natural rights and privileges of man|kind, the truth, ju&s;tice and rea&s;on of things, would rea|dily acknowledge.</P>
<P>BUT as this is a matter of very great importance, which labours in the minds of &s;ome of the le&s;s thinking part of men, and is denied to be truth by others, tho' as I think, in the very face of rea&s;on, and at the ex|pence of truth, ju&s;tice, natural righteou&s;ne&s;s and equity; I &s;hall endeavour to &s;et the truth of our propo&s;ition in a mo&s;t clear and evident point of light, before the minds of all who are di&s;po&s;ed to receive truth, and impartially to attend to evidence.</P>
<P>AS another leading truth, and what may help us in the clear proof of our pre&s;ent propo&s;ition, we may en|quire in this place, what that is which a people give up, or how much (if any thing) of their natural rights and privileges they part with, when they enter into civil &s;tate, and make them rulers and officers, of &s;upreme and &s;ub|ordinate degree and authority.</P>
<P>HERE I &s;hall fir&s;t &s;hew negatively, what a people do not give up, or part with, for the &s;ake of civil &s;ociety and government. 2dly I &s;hall &s;hew what they do really part with, of their natural rights and privileges, when they enter into civil &s;tate, &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND here let it be ob&s;erved, that a people do not give up, or part with their rights to the enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties, free of all mole&s;tations, in|juries, inva&s;ions and &s;eizures whatever: no &s;uch right do the people part with, when they enter into civil &s;tate and combination, and make them rulers &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate for its well being.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="014036_0048_0F92ABD21D5765F8">FOR, that they may enjoy their per&s;ons and properties thus free and unmole&s;ted, is one principal end of their entering into civil &s;tate; and they never can be &s;uppo&s;|ed to give up and relinqui&s;h their right and title to the enjoyment of tho&s;e things, when they enter into civil &s;tate, for the quiet and unmole&s;ted enjoyment of which things, as one main end in view, they entered into a civil &s;tate. For this would be to &s;uppo&s;e a people to enter in|to civil &s;tate and combination, for the enjoyment of cer|tain things in peace and quiet, the enjoyment of which things, they give up all claim and title to, when they enter into civil &s;tate and combination. Which would evidently be again, to &s;uppo&s;e a people to have a certain main end in view, in entering into civil &s;tate and &s;ocie|ty, which main end they have no reference to at all, in entering into a civil &s;tate and &s;ociety. A mo&s;t gro&s;sly contradictious and ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;ition!</P>
<P>WE have already &s;ufficiently proved, if it really want|ed any proof, that one principal end and de&s;ign A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. had in mind, when they entered into civil &s;tate, was that they might enjoy their per&s;ons and properties free from all injuries and inva&s;ions; we mu&s;t not therefore now &s;uppo&s;e them to have given up, or re|linqui&s;hed, their right to the enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties, free of all injuries and inva&s;ions; lea&s;t we fall upon gro&s;s and &s;hameful ab&s;urdities, and the mo&s;t palpable contradictions.</P>
<P>A people then, do always retain their right and title to the quiet and unmole&s;ted enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties, though they have entered into civil &s;tate and combination,</P>
<P>AGAIN, a people do not give up their right to have a voice in all public deci&s;ions concerning peace and war with other &s;tates; making alliances with other powers; &s;ending and receiving emba&s;&s;ies; entering into national leagues and compacts; &s;ettling and regulating trade and commerce, &amp;c. &amp;c. I do not pretend to determine how a people ought to have a voice in all the&s;e matters&punc; whe|ther per&s;onally, or by a repre&s;entation; though perhaps it is no hard matter to determine.&mdash;But a voice they
<PB N="49" REF="014036_0049_0F92ABD2EA629218">
mu&s;t have. And that every people have a natural and unalienable right to a voice in &s;uch deci&s;ions, wants no proof: and therefore that they cannot be &s;uppo|&s;ed to give up, or even to be capable to give up, &s;uch right, when they enter into civil &s;tate, is equally certain. When kingdoms levy war, or make peace with other &s;tates; when they make alliances with foreign powers; &s;end and receive emba&s;&s;ies; enter into national leagues and compacts; &s;ettle and regulate trade and commerce, &amp;c. who is not very &s;en&s;ible, that all the&s;e things have re&s;pect to the people, and tend exceedingly, either to make them ea&s;y and quiet, or unea&s;y and di&s;|quiet in the enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties, their natural and unalienable rights and priviledges? Pride and avarice many times may excite kings to levy war with foreign &s;tates, and carry them on, tho' ex|ceeding prejudicial to the people; draining them of money and men, and many other things nece&s;&s;ary to carry on the war. And &s;o on the other hand, timidity and an un&s;ea&s;onable fearfulne&s;s, &s;elf-intere&s;t, &amp;c. may prevail with them to make peace with other &s;tates, great|ly to their di&s;honour and detriment of their own. Kings may enter into alliances with other powers, &s;uch as are very un&s;afe and dangerous to the people. They may &s;end and receive emba&s;&s;ies mo&s;t unhappy for their &s;ub|jects, and them&s;elves too; as has often been the ca&s;e. Such national leagues and compacts may be made by princes, as will expo&s;e their own kingdoms to ravages and depredations, in an unlucky time. They may &s;et|tle and regulate trade and commerce with their own or other countries, upon &s;uch bottoms, and in &s;uch man|ner, as may be very pernicious to the people.</P>
<P>Now as all the&s;e things &s;o evidently re&s;pect the people, and tend &s;o directly to their good or ill, to their enjoyment, or non-enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties in peace and quiet; we mu&s;t never conclude that the people do, or can, give up their natural right to a voice in public deci&s;ions about all &s;uch matters, when they enter into civil &s;tate, with a de&s;ign to promote their be&s;t intere&s;t: Unle&s;s we mean
<PB N="50" REF="014036_0050_0F92ABD39B5A51C0">
to go into the former gro&s;s ab&s;urdity; and to maintain, that people have a great regard to the quiet and peace|able enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties, in en|tering into civil &s;tate; and yet that they have no regard to the&s;e at all, but &s;et this matter entirely a&s;ide, when they enter in civil &s;tate!</P>
<P>WAR can never be levied, peace never made, with foreign &s;tates, without the voice of the people: Alli|ances can never be &s;ettled, nor emba&s;&s;ies &s;ent and re|ceived, national leagues and compacts cannot be de|termined, trade and commerce never founded and regu|lated, but with the con&s;enting voice and &s;uffrage of the people per&s;onally, or by repre&s;entation. Let this be ano|ther &s;ettled point, that a people do not give up their right to have a voice in all public deci&s;ions concerning peace &amp; war with other &s;tates; making alliances with foreign powers; entering into leagues and compacts; &s;ending and receiving emba&s;&s;ies; &s;ettling and regulating trade and commerce, &amp;c. when they enter into civil &s;tate, for their civil good, liberty, protection, peace and &s;afety.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, the people do not give up their right of judging and determining in matters of religion; or their right to protection in the public wor&s;hip of the Deity, in &s;uch manner as they plea&s;e, or &s;hall judge be&s;t, not injurious to the civil &s;tate.</P>
<P>WE have proved, that the people have a &s;pecial re|gard to their protection and &s;ecurity in the public wor|&s;hip of God, when they enter into civil &s;tate, and make them rulers &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate: and con&s;equent|ly, that it is a main part of the tru&s;t which is repo&s;ited with them, to defend and protect the people, while they pay public honours to the divinity, in any manner not prejudicial to the civil &s;tate. Now, if the people do not give up their right of protection and defence, in the pub|lic wor&s;hip of God, in what manner they plea&s;e, not de|trimental to the civil &s;tate, then certainly they &s;till hold this natural right to determine and judge in religious matters for them&s;elves, and in what manner they will wor&s;hip God in public; if &s;o be they do not prejudice
<PB N="51" REF="014036_0051_0F92ABD490C67AB8">
the &s;tate: i. e. if they perform public wor&s;hip with de|cency, propriety and regularity, according to rea&s;on and &s;acred revelation.</P>
<P>EVERY man has an unalienable right of private judg|ment in all matters of a religious nature. Nor is it in his power to give up this right into the hands of any man, or number of men upon earth. For if one man &s;hould con&s;titute another his judge in matters of reli|gion, and &s;hould put the deci&s;ion of all his articles of religious creed into his hands; this would be the &s;ame thing, as tho' he &s;hould delegate a power to another man to go to Heaven for him, and be happy for him, in the favour and enjoyment of God. For the religion of na|ture, and of her God too, requires the judgment of e|very individual man, as well as his love and affections&punc; Unle&s;s therefore, one man can delegate to another, a power to love and &s;erve God, with all fidelity and con|&s;cience for him, and &s;o to be happy for him, he cannot give him a power to judge for him in matters of a reli|gious nature. But whoever tries the experiment, to find whether he can be happy in the happine&s;s of another, when the in&s;truments of mi&s;ery, and the engines of tor|ment and death are perpetually playing upon him, will be effectually convinced of his error and folly, by a &s;en&s;ible argument very unde&s;irable and painful. Ju&s;t as ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible is it then, for one man to give up his right of judgment in religious matters to another, as it is for him to make him&s;elf happy in the happine&s;s of another, or to go to Heaven upon anothers merits.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine is better calculated to &s;uit a Roman climate and con&s;titution, than an American: Tho' it will one great day be found not to have been agreeable to either, when every man will be rewarded or puni&s;hed for his own judgment, faith and practice, and not for tho&s;e of another. Men do no not therefore give up their right to judge for them&s;elves in the great affairs of religion, to civil magi&s;trates; nor have civil ma|gi&s;trates any power or authority given them by God or men, to judge for the people in the&s;e matters. But as every man mu&s;t be happy or mi&s;erable for him&s;elf, in
<PB N="52" REF="014036_0052_0F92ABD526F822A0">
another world, &s;o every man mu&s;t judge, and believe, and practice for him&s;elf in this world.</P>
<P>IF men have a right and it is their indi&s;pen&s;able duty, to judge for them&s;elves in matters of religion, as hath now been proved; then certainly they have a right to practice agreeable to their judgments, and con&s;cientious &s;entiments, both in public and private; always provided they do not prejudice the civil &s;tate. I do not &s;ay that men are infallible, or that they cannot judge ami&s;s, and practi&s;e wrong: or that their faith and practice may not be &s;uch as will expo&s;e them to the cen&s;ure of Chri&s;t, in his church. This is very po&s;&s;ible. But what I &s;ay is, that their faith and practice cannot expo&s;e them to the cen&s;ure of the civil law, unle&s;s they are detrimental to the civil &s;tate. The laws and power of a civil magi&s;tate are forever limited and determined by the civil peace and welfare of the people, or the &s;afety and happine&s;s of the civil &s;tate. Whenever any man's faith and practice in religious matters, are detrimental to the civil &s;tate, they properly fall under the cognizance of the civil magi&s;|trate: when they are not, let them be what they may, or ever &s;o wrong in other re&s;pects, they are not cogniza|ble by the civil magi&s;trate. Tho' it may be accounted a certain maxim, that when any man's faith and prac|tice, in religious matters, are di&s;advantageous to the civil &s;tate, they are wrong in theory, wrong in rea&s;on and revelation both. For it is inconceivable that any religious &s;entiments or practices, which are founded up|on rea&s;on and &s;acred revelation, &s;hould be unfavourable to the civil intere&s;ts and well-being of any people.</P>
<P>BUT le&s;t &s;ome &s;hould &s;u&s;pect that I here contradict what I have &s;aid el&s;ewhere, viz. that civil magi&s;trates are bound to defend and protect and maintain the public wor&s;hip of God, and even to u&s;e the civil &s;word, if no|thing el&s;e will do, to maintain it. Let them ob&s;erve that in the very place where I &s;aid this, I proved, that the public wor&s;hip of God, and ob&s;ervation of religion, were very greatly advantageous to the civil &s;tate. This is nothing contradictory to what I now &s;ay, but exactly coincident with it. For I do not &s;ay that civil magi&s;|trates
<PB N="53" REF="014036_0053_0F92ABD72EA8F240">
are under any obligations to nouri&s;h and cheri&s;h &s;uch wor&s;hip of the Deity, and practice of religion, as is not founded in rea&s;on, and &s;acred revelation; or to main|tain &s;uch as is detrimental to the civil &s;tate.</P>
<P>SO LONG as men believe and practice no doctrines in|con&s;i&s;tent with the peace and felicity of the &s;tate, they mu&s;t be protected by the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THIS then may be another determined point, that a people do not give up their right of private judgment, in matters of religion, or their con&s;ciences, when they enter into civil &s;tate; nor their right to actual protecti|on in the public wor&s;hip of the Deity, in &s;uch manner as is not prejudicial to the civil &s;tate.</P>
<P>BUT thus much may &s;uffice to have &s;aid upon the ne|gative &s;ide of this que&s;tion: though it may be that I have not mentioned every thing that the people do not give up for the &s;ake of a civil &s;tate, and perhaps &s;ome may think I have mentioned too many.</P>
<P>I would &s;ay po&s;itively, a people do give up their per|&s;onal right to defend and &s;ecure their per&s;ons and Pro|perties, in all ordinary ca&s;es.</P>
<P>IN a &s;tate of nature, each individual man hath a ju&s;t right to defend his own per&s;on again&s;t all a&s;&s;aults, and to repel force with force, and to &s;ecure his per&s;on from any injury that may be offered to it. But a civil &s;tate being entered into, and civil rulers cho&s;en, and inve&s;ted with power and authority to make and execute laws for the defence and &s;ecurity of every man's per&s;on who belongs to the &s;tate; each indivdual man has no longer a right inherent and per&s;onal, to defend his own per&s;on, and to re&s;i&s;t force with force, when he &s;hall be a&s;&s;aulted and vio|lence offered to his per&s;on. This right to defend his own per&s;on, which he before had, while he lived in a na|tural &s;tate, he hath given up to the civil &s;tate, and it is now the duty and bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate to de|fend and protect the per&s;on of each individual in in it. Yea, it would be directly to counteract the de&s;ign, as one principal de&s;ign, of entering into a civil &s;tate, if each individual in it &s;hould &s;till retain and exerci&s;e a right to defend his own per&s;on. This would be to take the bu&s;ine&s;s, which properly belongs to the civil &s;tate,
<PB N="54" REF="014036_0054_0F92ABD76BDAEDC0">
out of their hands and to put it back again into the hands of individuals, in who&s;e hands it truly was in the natural &s;tate; and &s;o it would be to evert the very foun|dation of the civil &s;tate. So that it is mo&s;t apparent, that each individual in a civil &s;tate, has not a right in or|dinary ca&s;es, (for I &s;hall immediately &s;hew that individu|als may have a right, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to defend their own per&s;ons, them&s;elves) to defend his own per&s;on from inju|ries, and that he hath given up this right into the hands of the civil &s;tate.</P>
<P>NOW let me &s;ay, that in &s;ome exempt ca&s;es, it may be the duty of individuals to defend and &s;ecure their own per|&s;ons, even in a civil &s;tate. For, though it be the duty and bu&s;ine&s;s of a civil &s;tate, to defend and protect the per|&s;ons of individuals; yet civil rulers and officers cannot be every where, and in all places, at the &s;ame time, for they are not &s;uppo&s;ed to be omni-pre&s;ent; and therefore they cannot always prevent injuries being offered to in|dividuals. And it may happen that individuals may be a&s;&s;aulted by ruffians, robbers, banditti and lawle&s;s wretches, and their lives endangered; when no a&s;&s;i&s;tance or relief can be had from civil authority: in &s;uch ca&s;e, individuals have a right to defend them&s;elves, and to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, injuries being committed upon them. And they mu&s;t be con&s;idered to be in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, in a &s;tate of nature, whil&s;t they do thus. To defend them|&s;elves in &s;uch a ca&s;e, would be a duty owing to their own per&s;ons, by the great laws of nature and &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>SO al&s;o with regard to individuals having a right to defend their properties: in all ordinary ca&s;es, they may not defend and &s;ecure their properties, by their own per|&s;onal exertions, and without any directions &s;o to do from civil authority; but mu&s;t refer the defence and &s;ecurity of them to the civil &s;tate. Yet in &s;ome extraordinary ca&s;es it may be very warrantable and ju&s;t for individuals to defend and &s;ecure their properties, as well as their per&s;ons, them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT is &s;o al&s;o with re&s;pect to the protection of individu|als in the public wor&s;hip of the Deity. Every man, in a
<PB N="55" REF="014036_0055_0F92ABD81A67E728">
&s;tate of nature, has a right to protect him&s;elf, in all his ob&s;ervation of religion and wor&s;hip of God: but in a civil &s;tate he has not. He hath given up his per&s;onal right to protect him&s;elf in the wor&s;hip of God, into the hands of the civil magi&s;trate; and it is now become the duty of the &s;tate, and what every one expects of them, to &s;ee to it that all individuals are protected and &s;ecured, when they wor&s;hip God, in any way, not prejudicial to the civil good and welfare.</P>
<P>A people al&s;o give up &s;o much of their private pro|perty, or e&s;tate, as is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport their civil ma|gi&s;trates and the &s;tate with honour and dignity, and to de|fray all the charges and expences of the common wealth.</P>
<P>I have &s;hewn that the people are under obligations to give their civil rulers an honourable reward for their &s;ervices to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE people mu&s;t al&s;o bear the charges of war, when that is nece&s;&s;ary; the expences of amba&s;&s;adors, &amp;c. in|deed they mu&s;t give up &s;o much of their properties and e&s;tates, as is required for the good and well being of the civil &s;tate: that &s;o they may enjoy them&s;elves and the re&s;t of their properties in peace and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>I think I have now fini&s;hed what I intended, before I &s;hould enter upon the direct proof of the propo&s;ition now under con&s;ideration: which a&s;&s;erts, that the people have right and authority to dethrone their King, and put down all other inferior officers, when they &s;hall counteract their obligations to them, and cea&s;e to an&s;wer the ends of their appointment, and con&s;titution in places of public tru&s;t &amp; authority,</P>
<P>HERE we mu&s;t make &s;ome recollections, and lay mat|ters together in a true and clear point of light, that &s;o we may be under better circum&s;tances to form a good judg|ment to rea&s;on right, and come at the truth of the ca&s;e.</P>

<P>IF the rea&s;onings and conclu&s;ions under the fir&s;t pro|po&s;ition be true and good, then this is an evident and undeniable truth. Yea, it &s;eems to be a mo&s;t plain and evident truth, barely from this fair repre&s;entation of the ca&s;e. But let us &s;ee in one view, how undeniable this truth appears, from what was proved under the fir&s;t pro|po&s;ition. If men, in a &s;tate of nature, have each an in|dividual right to his own per&s;on and property, and to defend and &s;ecure to him&s;elf the enjoyment of them, free from all injuries and inva&s;ions what&s;oever; and a right al&s;o to an equivalent to any injury done his per&s;on, or in|va&s;ion made of his property, or to make repri&s;als: if &s;uch natural &s;ociety have right to enter into civil &s;tate, and to appoint and con&s;titute Kings and civil rulers; to deter|mine what mode of government &s;hall take place, and what laws they will be governed by, for their civil good, protection, liberty, peace and &s;afety: I &s;ay, if a &s;ociety in a &s;tate of nature have &s;uch rights, then mo&s;t certainly and ju&s;tly they do retain &s;o much of their natural rights, even after civil combination and compact, that, if their
<PB N="58" REF="014036_0058_0F92ABDB322CAA60">
King and civil rulers will not give them liberty, pro|tection, &amp;c. in the enjoyment of their per&s;ons and pro|perties and religion, but gro&s;sly and &s;hamefully counter|act their mo&s;t &s;olemn obligations to them, and cea&s;e to an&s;wer their ends in making them civil rulers, and inve&s;t|ing them with civil power and authority, they may de|throne their King, and take all inferior officers and rulers out of their places of public tru&s;t and authority; and re|vert to a &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>IF a people have not a right to dethrone their King, in ca&s;e he proves a tyrant, and cea&s;es to con&s;ult their good and happine&s;s, and to &s;ecure to them their precious rights and natural privileges and properties, which the great King of Kings hath indulged them with; 'tis an inevitable and undeniable con&s;equence, that they have not a right to their per&s;ons and properties, nor any au|thority to &s;ecure them from injuries and &s;eizures: i. e. they have not a ju&s;t right to con&s;ult their own temporal and eternal intere&s;t, nor to promote them: and this is to &s;ay flatly and plainly, that they have no intere&s;t at all, neither temporal nor eternal. For not to have a right to defend and &s;ecure one's intere&s;t, is not to have right to u&s;e it as one's own; but not to have a right to u&s;e a thing as one's own, is not to have any right to the u&s;e of that thing; and this is, not to have any right to that thing at all: for to &s;ay that any one has a right to a thing, &amp; not a right to u&s;e that thing is a palpable contradiction! For a peo|ple to dethrone a tyrant, a King who does not con&s;ult nor pro|mote the good &amp; happine&s;s of their people, but the contrary, is for the people to con&s;ult their own good &amp; happine&s;s. That people then, who have not a right to dethrone a cor|rupt &amp; tyrannic King, one who does not an&s;wer the end for which he was made king, have not a right to con&s;ult, promote, defend and &s;ecure their own liberties, peace &amp; happine&s;s; but that people who have not a right to con|&s;ult, promote, defend &amp; &s;ecure their own liberties, peace &amp; happine&s;s, have no &s;uch things as liberties, peace and happine&s;s predicable of them&punc; according to the foregoing rea&s;oning. Unle&s;s then we mean flatly to deny that there are any &s;uch things as rights and properties, in per&s;ons

and e&s;tates, &amp;c. which may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to belong to any people, we mu&s;t never deny that people have a right to dethrone their king, when he proves to be a tyrant, and will not concern him&s;elf about them, nor endea|vour to protect them in the enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties, and religion, but wholly di&s;&s;erves the great purpo&s;es for which he was &s;eated upon the throne. If any thing in nature is capable of proof, the&s;e rights of the people in this re&s;pect, are capable to be proved, and of being &s;et in a mo&s;t convincing and clear point of light before all rea&s;onable and impartial minds.</P>
<P>NAY, it is as capable of demon&s;tration, as any pro|po&s;ition in Euclid, that a king, when he will not ful|fil his obligations to the people, but cea&s;es to an&s;wer their ends and de&s;igns in rai&s;ing him to royal dignity and tru&s;t, or counteracts the&s;e purpo&s;es by his tyrannic and dethrones conduct, does, ip&s;o facto, cea&s;e to be king, and dethrones him&s;elf: He is no longer king, nor to be reputed &s;uch. What in the name of common &s;en&s;e is a king made for? or what does the name king &s;ignify? is it an important and &s;acred thing, or a mere trifle? is it a rattle, a bauble from the toy&s;hops to plea&s;e chil|dren with? or is there an important and weighty charge and tru&s;t repo&s;ited with the man who wears the name of king; which if he fulfil, he is to be honoured and re|vered by all the people; but if he does not, he is no longer king&punc; or worthy that name? I am &s;erious: I a&s;k whe|ther a king is made &s;uch for him&s;elf, for his own ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, that he may &s;pend his days in luxury, wanton|ne&s;s and debauchery? or is he made &s;uch for his wi&s;dom, probity and benevolence, to be active, and to exert him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t to maintain the invaluable rights, properties and priviledges of the people, and to &s;ecure to them all the advantages and emoluments which God and nature have conferred upon them, both of a temporal and eternal &s;ignificancy? If he be not made king purely for him&s;elf, and if the people really de|&s;igned when they rai&s;ed him to royal dignity, and put the royal tiara upon his head, that he &s;hould con&s;ult and promote their good, and make them happy in the

<P>THIS doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance, 'tis true, was &s;ounded from many pulpits in Great-Bri|tain, by the court-clergy, pre&s;ently after the glorious reformation began to gain ground in England; tho' it be &s;o very &s;imilar to &s;ome doctrines of that apo&s;tate church; I mean the Romi&s;h church.

<Q>THE Court Bi&s;hops were no va&s;t ea&s;e, and went on bri&s;kly with re&s;toring all things to the old &s;tandard; the doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;&s;i&s;tance were now received.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the&s;e doctrines of ab&s;olute, unlimited obedience to Kings, and non re&s;i&s;tance have long &s;ince been explod|ed almo&s;t univer&s;ally, as mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and non&s;en&s;i|cal, de&s;tructive of all the natural rights and properties of the people, and di&s;onant to all ju&s;t principles of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. Yet, though the mo&s;t learned divines, and able&s;t politicians have many years &s;ince, di&s;avowed and refuted them, upon the &s;ounde&s;t maxims of rea&s;on and revelation, &s;ome will &s;till cheri&s;h and endeavour to main|tain them; tho' they are forced in order to do this, as I think, to &s;hipwreck rea&s;on, and commit an horrid rape upon &s;acred revelation. In this the old proverb is veri|fied, that no brat is &s;o ugly, having had a mother, as to die for want of a nur&s;e. For if any brat was ugly enough to be di&s;owned after its birth, and expo&s;ed to &s;truglings and death, it &s;hould really &s;eem as tho' the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance was: but alas! this very doctrine is &s;o lucky as to find &s;ome, who are willing to cheri&s;h and fo&s;ter it yet!</P>
<P>WE &s;ee, in the conon above cited, St. Paul introduced as a voucher for the doctrine! But if I was perfectly un|acquainted with St. Paul's abilities and doctrines, and had only heard that he was in&s;pired, and had received &s;ufficient evidence to induce me to believe it; I &s;hould immediately declare that he was pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice, and &s;hamefully mi&s;interpreted: for 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that an in&s;pired man &s;hould be a volunteer in &s;uch drudgery as this.</P>
<P>BUT it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary that I here &s;pend a few thoughts upon that text of St. Paul. For if he was a preacher of the doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance, I am gro&s;sly mi&s;taken, and have hitherto &s;candalou&s;ly mi&s;|under&s;tood the true meaning of that in&s;pired man, and mu&s;t certainly read my bible with more care and attenti|on for the future. The text referred to in the canon is in
<PB N="63" REF="014036_0063_0F92ABDF42769998">
St. Paul's epi&s;tle to the Romans xiii.1.8. Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: The powers that be, are ordained of God. Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God: and they that re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves damnation.</P>
<P>FOR rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power?

But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the &s;word in vain: For he is the mini&s;ter of God; a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. Wherefore ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake. For, for this cau&s;e pay ye tribute al&s;o: for they are Gods mini&s;ters, attending continually upon this very thing.

<P>I HAVE &s;et down this &s;cripture at large; and I &s;hall now enquire for its true meaning, and whether doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance are really preach|ed in it, or not.</P>
<P>I WOULD have this &s;cripture well under&s;tood: and therefore de&s;ire that &s;everal things may be very carefully con&s;idered, which will be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to us in gaining its true interpretation.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h critically between the power of Kings and civil rulers, civil power, or civil government, in general; the way and means by which any men come to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch power; and the u&s;e and improve|ment they make of their power. The&s;e things are very diver&s;e, and ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by every one.</P>
<P>CIVIL power, or civil government, &s;imply con&s;idered, is undoubtedly ordained of God. No one will pretend to di&s;pute this. Civil government, when con&s;idered as ab&s;tracted from the ways and means by which men come to be ve&s;ted with it, may truly be &s;aid to be of divine ori|ginal. 'Tis very plain that God de&s;igned that a race of
<PB N="64" REF="014036_0064_0F92ABDFE4AAFA68">
men &s;hould be continued upon earth, until the general judgment, or the con&s;ummation of all things, at the &s;e|cond coming of his divine and glorious &s;on. But it is as plain, that a race of men could not be continued thus long upon the earth, and Gods great de&s;igns and pur|po&s;es, in his univer&s;al plan of things, have been effected, without civil government taking place among them. The unavoidable con&s;equence is, that God de&s;igned that civil government &s;hould be &s;et up among men, and that this was one link in the infinite chain, one event among&s;t innumerable others, which God de&s;igned &s;hould have exi&s;tence, when he formed the amazing projection of a univer&s;e. Thus 'tis demon&s;trable from rea&s;on, and the very nature of tho&s;e things which God hath con&s;ti|tuted, and permitted to take place in his world, that civil government is by divine appointment.</P>
<P>GOOD David &s;eems thus to under&s;tand the matter. p&s;. lxv.6, 7. For promotion cometh neither from the ea&s;t, nor from the we&s;t, nor from the &s;outh. But God is the judge: He putteth down one and &s;etteth up ano|ther. Of this &s;ame opinion was Daniel, chap. 11, 21, 37. And he changeth the times, and the &s;ea&s;ons; he removeth kings, and &s;etteth up kings.&mdash;Thou, O king! art a king of kings: and the God of Heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and &s;trength, and glory. Thus civil or kingly power, con&s;idered as &s;ejoined from the way and means by which men come to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch power is from God.</P>
<P>BUT unle&s;s we con&s;ider civil power, or royal power, as thus &s;eparated from the way and means by which men arrive at &s;uch power, we &s;hall unavoidably run into gro&s;s errors; as many have done, in explaining the text we are now upon. Civil power is of God. But who dare to &s;ay that all the ways and means by which men have ever become ve&s;ted with civil power are of God, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as the power it&s;elf is! 'Tis certain, God has &s;ometimes di&s;approved of Kings, and plainly de|clared they were none of his. Ho&s;e, viii.4. They have &s;et up kings but not by me: They have made princes
<PB N="65" REF="014036_0065_0F92ABE450B15C78">
and I knew it not: of their &s;ilver and their gold have they made them idols; that they may be cut off. What was it God was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed with, concerning the&s;e kings? was it with the regal power it&s;elf? or was it not rather with the people's corrupt and idolatrous ways and means by which they rai&s;ed them to, and maintained them in their regal power and dignity?</P>
<P>KINGS have many times mounted thrones, and a&s;|&s;umed royal power and authority, in mo&s;t unju&s;t and unnatural ways. Many by mere conque&s;t and inva&s;ions, by murdering in a cruel and barbarous manner, the reign|ing princes, and the royal families, have got them&s;elves proclaimed and &s;eated upon their thrones. Every one, who is ever &s;o little acquainted with civil hi&s;tory, knows all this to be true, and much more of the like kind. But who will &s;ay that all the&s;e ways and methods of acquiring civil and royal power are from God, as the power it&s;elf is! Does Heaven approve of unju&s;t inva&s;i|ons, cruel murders and blood&s;hed, and all the innume|rable ways in which inhuman tyrants have &s;laughtered innocent kings and their families, and mounted their thrones!</P>
<P>AGAIN, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the u&s;e and improvement which men make of civil power, as a di&s;tinct thing from the power it&s;elf. The power it&s;elf, we may &s;ay again, is of God. But I pre&s;ume no man will &s;ay, that God hath ordained all the u&s;es that have been made of civil power, by all the wicked, tyrannic and de&s;potic princes, that have reigned &s;ince Nimrod built Nineveh and reigned there; in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, in which he hath or|dained civil power, or the power which tho&s;e wretches and pe&s;ts of mankind were inve&s;ted with, when &s;imply con&s;idered! If any one is inclined to think &s;o, let him ca&s;t his eyes upon his bible, and read I. Kings xi.31, 35, 37. And he &s;aid unto Jeroboam, take thee ten princes: for thus &s;aith the Lord the God of I&s;rael, be|hold I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solo|mon, and will give ten tribes to thee.&mdash;But I will take the kingdom out of his &s;ons hand, and will give it unto
<PB N="66" REF="014036_0066_0F92ABE4D739E088">
thee, even ten tribes.&mdash;And I will take thee, and thou &s;halt reign according to all that thy &s;oul de&s;ireth, and &s;halt be king over I&s;rael.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE was it that Jehovah was thus di&s;plea&s;ed with Solomon, even &s;o as to &s;natch from him ten princes, or tribes, and to give &s;o large a part of the kingdom, as ten twelfths at lea&s;t, to his &s;ervant Jeroboam? was it becau&s;e Solomon &s;at on the throne of I&s;rael, &s;wayed a &s;ceptre, and had civil power and government repo&s;ited with him? If we look back a little to v.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. we &s;hall find what the cau&s;e of God's re&s;entment was, and wherefore he took the kingdom from Solomon, or his &s;on.</P>
<P><HI>For it came to pa&s;s, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father. For Solomon went after A&s;htoreth the godde&s;s of the Zidonians, and after Milcom, the abomination of the Am|monites. And Solomon did evil in the &s;ight of the Lord, and went not fully after the Lord as did David his father Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemo&s;h the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jeru&s;alem; and for Molah the abomination of the children of Ammon. And likewi&s;e did he for all his &s;trange wives, which burned incen&s;e and &s;acrificed unto their &s;trange gods. Thus Solomon was guilty of gro&s;s and &s;hameful idolatry; and for this cau&s;e God expre&s;sly told him that he would take the kingdom from him. v.xi. of the &s;ame chapter. Therefore the Lord &s;aid unto Solomon, fora&s;much as this is done of thee, and thou ha&s;t not kept my covenant, and my &s;tatutes, which I commanded thee, I will &s;urely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy &s;ervant.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY one who under&s;tands the con&s;titution of the Hebrew civil government, knows that idolatry was, cri|men le&s;ae maje&s;tatis, or high trea&s;on again&s;t Jehovah, who was the politic head, and &s;upreme civil ruler in the Jewi&s;h nation; as it was &s;etting up another god in the &s;tead of Jehovah, their only God and King. Idolatry was al&s;o high trea&s;on again&s;t the civil &s;tate it&s;elf of the Hebrews, it was a notorious and direct &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titution, an open breach of the magna charta of that nation. When therefore Solomon built high places for
<PB N="67" REF="014036_0067_0F92ABE6DB051570">
A&s;htoreth, Milcom, Chemo&s;h and Molech, he &s;et up tho&s;e idols for gods, in affront to Jehovah the true God and rightful &s;overeign of I&s;rael, than which, no crime that he was capable to commit, tended more directly and naturally to &s;ubvert the very foundation of the con&s;titution of the Jewi&s;h civil polity, and to counteract the magna charta of the Hebrews, and to expo&s;e the whole nation to Jehovah's wrath, and &s;o to total ruin.</P>
<P>FOR this corrupt u&s;e or abu&s;e of his royal power, in king Solomon, Jehovah was di&s;plea&s;ed. We plainly &s;ee the&s;e three things to be very di&s;tinct; civil power, or civil go|vernment, &s;imply con&s;idered; the ways and methods by which men become ve&s;ted with civil power; and the u&s;e and improvement they make of it.</P>
<P>Now, we are ready perhaps to a&s;certain the genuine meaning of the text of St Paul. When St. Paul &s;ays, that there is no power but of God, he means that no civil power, by what ways and means &s;oever obtained, is without God's permi&s;&s;ion; and that civil power, or civil government, &s;imply con&s;idered, is according to God's eternal purpo&s;e and de&s;ign: and when he &s;ays, that the powers that be, are ordained of God; he means that civil government, regal and imperial power and authority, ab&s;tracted from the ways and means by which men unju&s;tly obtain &s;uch power, are really the ordinance and appointment of God. When he &s;ays, who&s;oever re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God; he means, that who&s;oever re&s;i&s;teth, or oppo&s;eth civil pow|er, as &s;uch, or civil government as &s;uch, re&s;i&s;teth or oppo&s;eth God's ordinance. And very well may &s;uch a one be &s;aid to merit damnation. Or &s;uch as thus re&s;i&s;t and oppo&s;e God's ordinance or appointment, &s;hall re|ceive to them&s;elves, and that ju&s;tly, detriment or judg|ment <HI>heautois krima leep&s;ontai.</HI> The Apo&s;tle never dreampt of teaching the Romans, or any other people under Hea|ven, that all the ways and methods, by which every emperor and prince, obtained imperial and royal power, and all the u&s;es they ever made of &s;uch powers, were from God, and ordained by him, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, in which the powers them&s;elves, or civil government, &s;im|ply con&s;idered, was from God, and ordained by him!
<PB N="68" REF="014036_0068_0F92ABE7F6B543A8">
St. Paul knew, and every other man that knows any thing, knows, that God &s;ometimes permits men to ob|tain civil power by unnatural, cruel and very unrighte|ous means; and to u&s;e &s;uch power when they have got it, for very corrupt and diabolical purpo&s;es, to the ruin and de&s;truction of the people, the wretched &s;ubjects. And indeed it cannot otherwi&s;e be, &s;o long as God per|mits things to proceed, in the phy&s;ical and moral worlds, according to their nature. So long as the great intel|ligent author, and powerful upholder of the world, &s;hall permit phy&s;ical and moral cau&s;es to operate, and their effects to be produced according to their nature, there will unavoidably be great injuries, corruptions and wrongs in the moral and civil world. But this, by no means proves, that God is well plea&s;ed with, or ap|proves of, the&s;e moral and civil wrongs. But when the&s;e things do happen in the world, when men either come thus to civil power and tru&s;t, or u&s;e it for &s;uch hor|rid purpo&s;es, God di&s;approves; nor did St. Paul mean to make it the duty of any people, who can do other|wi&s;e, tamely to &s;ubmit to the&s;e powers, and without any the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, to pay obedience to tho&s;e laws and orders which tend naturally and directly to bring ruin, mi&s;ery and death upon them and their children yet unborn! And it &s;hould really &s;eem as tho' tho&s;e men do wilfully mi&s;interpret the in&s;pired man, who would bear us in hand that he means any &s;uch thing. The Apo&s;tle expre&s;sly &s;ays, giving us an account of the qualificati|ons of the civil power, or ruler, to whom chri&s;tians ought to be &s;ubject and obedient, that rulers are not a terror to GOOD works, but to the EVIL. That he is the mini&s;ter of God for GOOD. That he is an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth EVIL. And that we mu&s;t be &s;ubject to civil rulers, not only for wrath, or be|cau&s;e they have power to puni&s;h men, but for CONSCI|ENCE &s;ake. And that they are &s;uch men to whom tri|bute, cu&s;tom, fear and honour are due. Are tyrants, are traitors again&s;t the civil &s;tate, (for I &s;uppo&s;e that a king is as capable of committing high trea&s;on as any of his &s;ubjects are; and that, to counteract the foundation laws, and con&s;titutional principles of the &s;tate, is crimen le&s;ae
<PB N="69" REF="014036_0069_0F92ABE899CC9188">
magnae chartae; equal to crimen le&s;ae maje&s;tatis regiae) are tho&s;e things and civil rulers who are a terror to good works, and an encouragement to evil, who execute wrath upon tho&s;e that do well, and to whom no man can be &s;ubject for con&s;cience &s;ake, but for wrath only, are the&s;e the men, the&s;e the civil rulers to whom tribute, cu&s;tom, fear and honour are due, and to whom chri&s;tians, or any other people, are bound to pay pa&s;&s;ive obedience without the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, on pain of damnation! &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions in the &s;acred text, as above cited, would be apt to lead an hone&s;t enquirer after truth and the right of the ca&s;e, to believe that St. Paul meant to exhort the Romans and all men, chearfully to obey their civil rulers who u&s;ed their power and authority well, for Gods glory and the good of the people. And &s;uch a man would be very hardly per&s;uaded to &s;u&s;pect that the apo&s;tle meant to teach, that men ought to yield an ab&s;olute and unlimited obedience, without any re&s;i&s;tance, to civil rulers, let them be, or do, what they will, or what their tyrannic, de&s;potic and corrupt principles would naturally lead them to do!</P>
<P>SUCH an interpretation of St. Paul as &s;ome have given, and &s;till continue to give, might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn to be re|plete with the foule&s;t ab&s;urdities, and to be contrary to truth, natural ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s; which would prove tho&s;e men, who are the authors of &s;uch interpreta|tion, to have bad hearts, or weak heads, or both.</P>
<P>BUT I forbear, having been too prolix already upon this text, &amp; chearfully &s;ubmit my interpretation to the te&s;t of truth and rea&s;on and the word of God, little doubting but it will be well approved by them all.</P>
<P>I WELL know that there are &s;everal objections made, &s;ome again&s;t the truth of the doctrine of this 4th propo&s;i|tion; others again&s;t &s;uch doctrine's being practiced upon: and there are al&s;o a few texts of holy &s;criptures, that are alledged again&s;t the doctrine, be&s;ides that we have &s;o largely treated upon. This doctrine, every one knows, hath been practiced in the Briti&s;h nation, as well as in many others. I pray to God, that Great-Britain may ne|ver again &s;ee the day, when it &s;hall become nece&s;&s;ary for the people to exert them&s;elves, as hath been proved to be right they &s;hould, to dethrone a Briti&s;h King! But this
<PB N="70" REF="014036_0070_0F92ABE99B056778">
rueful time may come. I did not de&s;ign, when I fir&s;t un|dertook to &s;tudy and write upon this &s;ubject, to do any more than barely to prove the truth of the doctrines I ad|vanced: whether I have done &s;o much, or not, I freely &s;ubmit. For &s;everal rea&s;ons that might be given, were it nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;hall not be very officious in an&s;wering ob|jections.</P>
<P>YET I will &s;ay a few words, in an&s;wer to two or three objections again&s;t the impleaded doctrine.</P>
<P>ONE objection, which &s;eems to be pointed again&s;t the truth of the doctrine of the fir&s;t propo&s;ition, as well as again&s;t the doctrine of the 4th being put in practice, is, that it will deprive Kings of a legal trial, by their Peers, which is a privilege granted, in the be&s;t regulated &s;tates, to all the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>EVERY one may &s;ee, by adverting to the fir&s;t propo&s;i|tion, that this objection is directly again&s;t its truth. For if the people have a natural and inherent right to appoint and con&s;titute a King &s;upreme, and all &s;ubordinate civil officers and rulers over them, &amp;c. then the people are the original of civil power: and if civil pow|er originates from the people, the plain and undeniable con&s;equence is, that the people are the proper judges whether the power they inve&s;t their king with be u&s;ed well or ill: and if &s;o, the people are the peers, before who&s;e tribunal the king mu&s;t be judged; they are the per&s;ons, call them what you plea&s;e, before whom the king mu&s;t &s;tand or fall.</P>
<P>IN a mixed monarchy, if the people have been plea&s;ed to con&s;titute &s;uch, when the king is corrupted, and is en|clined to be too ab&s;olute, and will not give the royal a&s;|&s;ent to bills which have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tates, or parliament, but is re&s;olutely engaged to be a tyrannic and de&s;potic &s;overeign, and not to rule the kingdom by whole&s;ome laws; then the &s;tates or parliament have the power of ex|ecution, as well as of legi&s;lation, devolved upon them; and have right and authority, with the voice of the people, to dethrone the tyrannic king. But if the &s;tates of par|liament are al&s;o corrupted, and have drank &s;o deep, with the king, of the &s;pirit of ab&s;olutene&s;s and de&s;poti&s;m, that the people are deprived of their natural rights and
<PB N="71" REF="014036_0071_0F92ABEA1BC1F118">
privileges, &s;o that they can no longer endure; then both the legi&s;lative and executive powers are reverted to the people, and they have a right in the &s;ight of God, the king of kings and lord over all, to convict, judge and condemn the king and the &s;tates of parliament, by their con&s;titution, and the magna charta of the kingdom. All this is true if the propo&s;ition be true; therefore the ob|jection is of no force, &s;o long as the truth of our fir&s;t pro|po&s;ition remains unrefuted. 'Tis the bu&s;ine&s;s therefore of the objector to di&s;prove the truth of that propo&s;ition. When he &s;hall do this, I will grant to him, that the king is not accountable to the people for any u&s;es or abu&s;es of his royal power, and will immediately commence a preacher of the doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re|&s;i&s;tance. Another objection again&s;t the practice upon the 4th propo&s;ition, is, that it will introduce anarchy and confu&s;ion, club-laws, &amp;c. to the inevitable de&s;truction of the liberties, peace and happine&s;s of the whole civil com|munity.</P>
<P>TO this objection I would &s;ay, it is po&s;&s;ible that the dethroning a King, and the removal of civil rulers out of their places of power and tru&s;t, may have &s;ome bad tendencies, unle&s;s great care, wi&s;dom and prudence be exerci&s;ed. But if the important and intere&s;ting affair be managed wi&s;ely and prudently, it is not &s;uppo&s;able, that greater mi&s;chiefs and mi&s;eries will en&s;ue, upon the de|throning a King, who is a tyrannic and wicked ruler, &amp;c. than mu&s;t be endured by the people, &s;o long as a tyrant is on the throne, and his corrupt creatures and para&s;ites kept in places of power and tru&s;t about him. England was never more happy before, nor much more &s;ince, than after the head of the fir&s;t Stuart was &s;evered from his body, and while it was under the protector&s;hip of Oliver Cromwell. 'Tis true, there were confu&s;ions in the in|teregnum, after the death of that friend and lover of his country and the liberties of mankind. But who cau&s;|ed them? They were &s;uch men as will unavoidably give di&s;turbances to any people either in a natural or civil &s;tate, or in a &s;tate that is neither, if they be allowed. Men that have an unbounded de&s;ire, and an in&s;atiable thir&s;t for empire, as Fleetwood, De&s;borough, Lambert, Sir
<PB N="72" REF="014036_0072_0F92ABEAD93C6360">
Hen. Vane, and &s;ome others, undoubtedly had, if they are not promoted, will make any &s;tate or people on earth unea&s;y, and give them trouble and difficulty.</P>
<P>THESE were the men who were the fomenters of all the divi&s;ions and confu&s;ions of 1659.</P>
<P>AGAIN 'tis &s;aid, that a king mu&s;t have re&s;pect to his own honour, dignity and happine&s;s, as well as to the &s;afe|ty and tranquility of the &s;tate and people, in all his ad|mini&s;trations.</P>
<P>I ALLOW this objection to be a good one, and am rea|dy to confe&s;s that a king mu&s;t endeavour his own honour, dignity and happine&s;s in his government; but then I &s;uppo&s;e that a king cannot take a more direct and effec|tual method to advance and promote his own honour; dignity and happine&s;s, than to rule his kingdom by good and whole&s;ome laws; &s;uch as are well calculated to pro|tect and defend the people, in the quiet enjoyment of their per&s;ons, properties and religion, and to give peace and tranquility to the whole &s;tate. Such laws, and &s;uch form of government and admini&s;tration, as is mo&s;t aptly calculated to promote the people's good, and to give uni|ver&s;al ea&s;e, protection and &s;ecurity to the whole civil com|munity, tends mo&s;t naturally and directly to advance the honour and reputation, dignity and happine&s;s of the prince who is on the throne. No king can be honourable or happy, who&s;e kingdom is di&s;honourable, unea&s;y, oppre&s;|&s;ed and unhappy. Every king, who de&s;ires to be honor|able and happy, will endeavour to render his kingdon free and quiet, happy and powerful.</P>
<P>THIS is all I &s;hall &s;ay upon the objections again&s;t the doctrines of this &s;hort tract, which I may call mine; tho' the rights of the people have been viewed by many others, much in the &s;ame point of light, in which I have held them up to view, yet I have not taken &s;o much as one &s;entence from any author, but what I have given him credit for, in the bottom of the page, as every one will undoubtedly judge, who will give them&s;elves the trouble to peru&s;e the&s;e pages.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid little or nothing about the method in which the people ought to proceed, in treating with civil magi&s;trates, who do not u&s;e their power and authority for
<PB N="73" REF="014036_0073_0F92ABEB975E19F8">
the good and intere&s;t of the people, but violate their tru&s;t and obligations to them, in &s;uch manner as they cannot endure; nor do I &s;uppo&s;e this bu&s;ine&s;s belongs to me. However, I leave this matter to the politicians and &s;tate&s;men, not profe&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to be a politician: tho' I do profe&s;s my&s;elf to be a true friend to the rights and li|berties of mankind, and an advocate for natural ju&s;tice, righteou&s;ne&s;s and equity, as well as a liege &s;ubject to my rightful &s;overeign.</P>
<P>AS to any texts of &s;acred &s;criptures, which &s;peak of the duties and obligations of the people to Kings and civil rulers, to honour, revere and obey them: I &s;uppo&s;e that no text of &s;cripture obliges any people tamely to &s;ubmit to tyranny, oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;lavery's hateful chains; but that many texts teach it to be the duty of a people to yield ready and chearful obedience to all civil rulers, who rule for God's glory and their be&s;t intere&s;t by making and executing wi&s;e and whole&s;ome laws.</P>
<P>I AM not &s;o vain as to imagine that what I have written upon this &s;ubject, will be very entertaining or profitable to my inteligent readers, if I &s;hould have any &s;uch, who have peru&s;ed large volumes, &s;tudied much and are thoroughly acquainted with the laws of nature and nati|ons. Nor was I per&s;uaded to make the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es pub|lic for the benefit of &s;uch; but for the advantage of the people, to who&s;e natural and ju&s;tly acquired rights and privileges, I am firmly &amp; inviolably attached. For the&s;e I am willing to plead in my family, my clo&s;et, my pulpit and in public. And if I might be &s;o happy, as to rai&s;e in the minds of the people, a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e rights and privileges which nature and her God have indulged them with, and a manly and becoming re&s;olution to a&s;|&s;ert and defend them, in all wi&s;e, prudent and likely ways; I &s;hall obtain my main de&s;ign, in this &s;hort tractate; and &s;hall heartily rejoice, in that I have been an in&s;trument of doing &s;ome little good to my fellow men, in this early &s;tage of my life and action, and think my&s;elf well repaid.</P>
