<HEAD>HIS Excellency the Governor was plea&s;ed to open the A&s;&s;embly with the following Speech to both Hou&s;es, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Council, and, Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE nothing in &s;pecial Com|mand from his Maje&s;ty to lay before you at this Time; I have general In&s;tructions to re|commend to you, at all Times, &s;uch Mea&s;ures as may tend to pro|mote that Peace and Order upon which your own Happine&s;s and Pro&s;perity as well as his Maje&s;ty's Service very much depend. That the Govern|ment is at pre&s;ent in a di&s;tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bed and di&s;ordered State is a Truth too evident to be denied. The Cau&s;e of this Di&s;order appears to me equally evi|dent. I wi&s;h I may be able to make it appear &s;o to you, for then I may not doubt that you will
<PB N="4" REF="012856_0003_0F8B9520F9A3C0A8">
agree with me in the proper Mea&s;ures for the Removal of it. I have plea&s;ed my&s;elf, for &s;eve|ral Years pa&s;t, with Hopes that the Cau&s;e would cea&s;e of it&s;elf and the Effect with it, but I am di&s;|appointed, and I may not any longer, con&s;i&s;tent with my Duty to the King and my Regard to the Intere&s;t of the Province, delay communicating my Sentiments to you upon a Matter of &s;o great Im|portance. I &s;hall be explicit and treat the Sub|ject without Re&s;erve. I hope you will receive what I have to &s;ay upon it with Candor, and, if you &s;hall not agree in Sentiments with me, I promi&s;e you, with Candor likewi&s;e, to receive and con&s;i|der what you may offer in An&s;wer.</P>
<P>When our Predece&s;&s;ors fir&s;t took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Plantation or Colony, under a Grant and Charter from the Crown of England, it was their Sen&s;e, and it was the Sen&s;e of the Kingdom, that they were to remain &s;ubject to the &s;upreme Au|thority of Parliament. This appears from the Charter it&s;elf and from other irre&s;i&s;table Evidence. This &s;upreme Authority has, from Time to Time, been exerci&s;ed by Parliament and &s;ubmit|ted to by the Colony, and hath been, in the mo&s;t expre&s;s Terms, acknowledged by the Legi&s;lature and, except about the Time of the Anarchy and Confu&s;ion in England which preceeded the Re&s;|toration of King Charles the Second, I have not di&s;covered that it has been called in Que&s;tion even by private or particular Per&s;ons until within &s;even or eight Years la&s;t pa&s;t. Our Provincial or Lo|cal Laws have, in numerous In&s;tances, had Rela|tion to Acts of Parliament made to re&s;pect the Plantations in general and this Colony in particu|lar,
<PB N="5" REF="012856_0004_0F8B9521FB0C3600">
and in our Executive Courts both Juries and Judges have; to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, con&s;i|dered &s;uch Acts as Part of our Rule of Law. Such a Con&s;titution, in a Plantation, is not peculiar to England but agrees with the Principles of the mo&s;t celebrated Writers upon the Law of Nations that when a Nation takes Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a di&s;tant Country and &s;ettles there, that Country, though &s;eparated from the principal E&s;tabli&s;hment or Mother Country, naturally becomes a Part of the State equally with its ancient Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>So much however of the Spirit of Liberty breathes thro' all Parts of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titu|tion, that although from the Nature of Govern|ment there mu&s;t be one &s;upreme Authority over the whole&punc; yet this Con&s;titution will admit of &s;ub|ordinate Powers with legi&s;lative and executive Authority, greater or le&s;s according to local and other Circum&s;tances. Thus we &s;ee a Variety of Corporations formed within the Kingdom with Powers to make and execute &s;uch Bylaws as are for their immediate U&s;e and Benefit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Mem|bers of &s;uch Corporations &s;till remaining &s;ubject to the general Laws of the Kingdom. We &s;ee al&s;o Governments e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Plantations which, from their &s;eparate and remote Situation, require more general and exten&s;ive Powers of Legi&s;lation within them&s;elves than tho&s;e formed within the Kingdom, but &s;ubject neverthele&s;s, to all &s;uch Laws of the Kingdom as immediately re&s;|pect them or are de&s;igned to extend to them, and accordingly we in this Province have, from the fir&s;t Settlement of it, been left to the Exerci&s;e of our legi&s;lative and executive Powers, Parliament

occa&s;ionally though rarely, interpo&s;ing as in its Wi&s;dom has been judged nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Under this Con&s;titution, for more than One Hundred Years, the Laws both of the &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate Authority were in general, duly executed, Offenders again&s;t them have been brought to condign Puni&s;hment, Peace and Order have been maintained and the People of this Pro|vince have experienced as largely the Advantages of Government, as, perhaps, any People upon the Globe, and they have from Time to Time in the mo&s;t public Manner expre&s;&s;ed their Sen&s;e of it and, once in every Year, have offered up their united Thank&s;givings to God for the Enjoyment of the&s;e Privileges and, as often, their united Prayers for the Continuance of them.</P>
<P>At Length the Con&s;titution has been called in Que&s;tion and the Authority of the Parliament of Great-Britain to make and e&s;tabli&s;h Laws for the Inhabitants of this Province has been, by ma|ny, denied. What was, at fir&s;t, whi&s;pered with Caution, was &s;oon after openly a&s;&s;erted in Print and, of late, a Number of Inhabitants in &s;everal of the principal Towns in the Province, have a&s;|&s;embled together in their re&s;pective Towns and, having a&s;&s;umed the Name of legal Town Meet|ings, have pa&s;&s;ed Re&s;olves which they have or|dered to be placed upon their Town Records, and cau&s;ed to be printed &amp; publi&s;hed in Pamphlets and News-Papers. I am &s;orry that it is thus become impo&s;&s;ible to conceal what I could wi&s;h had never been made public. I will not particularize the&s;e Re&s;olves or Votes and &s;hall only ob&s;erve to you,
<PB N="7" REF="012856_0006_0F8B9526F7901F00">
in general, that &s;ome of them deny the &s;upreme Authority of Parliament, and &s;o are repugnant to the Principles of the Con&s;titution, and that others &s;peak of this &s;upreme Authority, of which the King is a con&s;tituent Part and to every Act of which his A&s;&s;ent is nece&s;&s;ary, in &s;uch Terms as have a direct Tendency to alienate the Affections of the People from their Sovereign who has ever been mo&s;t tender of their Rights, and who&s;e Per|&s;on, Crown and Dignity we are under every po&s;|&s;ible Obligation to defend and &s;upport. In con|&s;equence of the&s;e Re&s;olves, Committees of Cor|re&s;pondence are formed, in &s;everal of tho&s;e Towns, to maintain the Principles upon which they are founded.</P>
<P>I know of no Arguments, founded in Rea&s;on, which will be &s;ufficient to &s;upport the&s;e Principles or to ju&s;tify the Mea&s;ures taken in Con&s;equence of them. It has been urged, that the &s;ole Power of making Laws is granted by Charter to a Le|gi&s;lature e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Province, con&s;i&s;ting of the King by his Repre&s;entative the Governor, the Council and the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives&mdash;that by this Charter there are likewi&s;e granted or a&s;&s;ured to the Inhabitants of the Province all the Liberties and Immunities of free and natural Sub|jects, to all Intents Con&s;tructions and Purpo&s;es what&s;oever, as if they had been born within the Realm of England&mdash;that it is Part of the Liberties of Engli&s;h Subjects, which has its Foundation in Nature, to be governed by Laws made by their Con&s;ent in Per&s;on or by their Repre&s;entative&mdash;that the Subjects in this Province are not and can|not be Repre&s;ented in the Parliament of Great-Britain
<PB N="8" REF="012856_0007_0F8B95293699F760">
and, con&s;equently, the Acts of Parliament cannot be binding upon them.</P>
<P>I do not find, Gentlemen, in the Charter &s;uch an Expre&s;&s;ion as <HI>&s;ole</HI> Power or any Words which import it. The General Court has, by Charter, <HI>full</HI> Power to make &s;uch Laws as are not repug|nant to the Laws of England. A favourable Con|&s;truction has been put upon this Clau&s;e when i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> has been allowed to intend &s;uch Laws of Eng|land only as are expre&s;ly declared to re&s;pect us. Surely then this is by Charter a Re&s;erve of Pow|er and Authority to Parliament to bind us by &s;uch Laws, at lea&s;t, as are made expre&s;ly to re|fer to us and con&s;equently, is a Limitation of the Power given to the General Court. Nor can it be contended that by the Liberties of free and natural Subjects is to be under&s;tood an Ex|emption from Acts of Parliament becau&s;e not re|pre&s;ented there, &s;eeing it is provided, by the &s;ame Charter, that &s;uch Acts &s;hall be in Force; and if they that make the Objection to &s;uch Acts will read the Charter with Attention, they mu&s;t be convinced that this Grant of Liberties and Im|munities is nothing more than a Declaration and A&s;&s;urance on the Part of the Crown that the Place to which their Predece&s;&s;ors were about to remove was and would be con&s;idered as Part of the Do|minions of the Crown of England, and therefore that the Subjects of the Crown &s;o removing, and tho&s;e born there or in their Pa&s;&s;age thither or in their Pa&s;&s;age from thence, would not become Aliens but would throughout all Parts of the Engli&s;h Dominions, wherever they might happen to be, as well as within the

Colony, retain the Liberties and Immunities of free and natural Subjects, their Removal from or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> being born within the Realm notwith&s;tand|ing. If the Plantations be Part of the Domini|ons of the Crown, this Clau&s;e in the Charter does not confer or re&s;erve any Liberties but what would have been enjoyed without it and what the Inhabitants of every other Colony do enjoy where they are without a Charter. If the Plantations are not the Dominions of the Crown will not all that are born here be con&s;idered as born out of the Ligeance of the King of England, and when|ever they go into any Part of the Dominions will they not be deemed Aliens to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, this Grant in the Charter notwith|&s;tanding?</P>
<P>They who claim Exemption from Acts of Par|liament by Virtue of their Rights as Engli&s;hmen, &s;hould con&s;ider that it is impo&s;&s;ible the Rights of Engli&s;h Subjects &s;hould be the &s;ame, in every Re|&s;pect, in all Parts of the Dominions. It is one of their Rights as Engli&s;h Subjects to be governed by Laws made by Per&s;ons in who&s;e Election they have, from Time to Time, a Voice&mdash;They re|move from the Kingdom where, perhaps, they were in the full Exerci&s;e of this Right to the Plantations where it cannot be exerci&s;ed or where the Exerci&s;e of it would be of no Benefit to them. Does it follow that the Government, by their Removal from one Part of the Dominions to another, lo&s;es it's Authority over that Part to which they remove, and that they are freed from the Subjection they were under before; or do they expect that Government &s;hould relinqui&s;h
<PB N="10" REF="012856_0009_0F8B952A03F43CD0">
its Authority becau&s;e they cannot enjoy this par|ticular Right? Will it not rather be &s;aid that, by this their voluntary Removal, they have re|linqui&s;hed for a Time at lea&s;t, one of the Rights of an Engli&s;h Subject which they might if they plea&s;ed have continued to enjoy and may again enjoy when&s;oever they will return to the Place where it can be exerci&s;ed?</P>
<P>They who claim Exemption, as Part of their Rights by Nature, &s;hould con&s;ider that every Re&s;traint which Men are laid under by a State of Government is a Privation of Part of their natural Rights, and of all the different Forms of Government which exi&s;t, there can be no two of them in which the Departure from Natural Rights is exactly the &s;ame. Even in Ca&s;e of Repre&s;entation by Election, do they not give up Part of their natural Rights when they con&s;ent to be repre&s;ented by &s;uch Per&s;on as &s;hall be cho|&s;en by the Majority of the Electors, although their own Voices may be for &s;ome other Per&s;on? And is it not contrary to their natural Rights to be obliged to &s;ubmit to a Repre&s;entative for &s;e|ven Years, or even one Year, after they are di&s;|&s;atisfied with his Conduct, although they gave their Voices for him when he was elected? This mu&s;t therefore be con&s;idered as an Objection again&s;t a State of Government rather than again&s;t any particular Form.</P>
<P>If what I have &s;aid &s;hall not be &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy &s;uch as object to the Supreme Authority of Parliament over the Plantations, there may &s;omething further be added to induce them to an
<PB N="11" REF="012856_0010_0F8B952AB6A82060">
Acknowledgment of it which I think will well de&s;erve their Con&s;ideration. I know of no Line that can be drawn between the &s;upreme Autho|rity of Parliament and the total Independence of the Colonies: It is impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be two independent Legi&s;latures in one and the &s;ame State, for although there may be but one Head, the King, yet the two Legi&s;lative Bodies will make two Governments as di&s;tinct as the King|doms of England and Scotland before the Union. If we might be &s;uffered to be altogether inde|pendent of Great-Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">in, could we have any Claim to the Protection of that Government of which we are no longer a Part? Without this Protection &s;hould we not become the Prey of one or the other Powers of Europe, &s;uch as &s;hould fir&s;t &s;eize upon us? Is there any Thing which we have more Rea&s;on to dread than Independence? I hope it will never be our Misfortune to know by Experience the Difference between the Liber|ties of an Engli&s;h Coloni&s;t and tho&s;e of the Spa|ni&s;h, French or Dutch.</P>
<P>If then the Supremacy of Parliament over the whole Briti&s;h Dominions &s;hall no longer be de|nied, it will follow that the <HI>meer</HI> Exerci&s;e of its Authority can be no Matter of Grievance. If it has been or &s;hall be exerci&s;ed in &s;uch Way and Manner as &s;hall appear to be grievous, &s;till this cannot be &s;ufficient Grounds for immediately denying or renouncing the Authority or refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to it. The Acts and Doings of Autho|rity in the mo&s;t perfect Form of Government will not always be thought ju&s;t and equitable by all the Parts of which it con&s;i&s;ts, but it is the greate&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="012856_0011_0F8B952BC4DD4128">
Ab&s;urdity to admit the &s;everal Parts to be at Li|berty to obey or di&s;obey according as the Acts of &s;uch Authority may be approved or di&s;approved of by them, for this nece&s;&s;arily works a Di&s;&s;olu|tion of the Government. The Manner then of obtaining Redre&s;s mu&s;t be by Repre&s;entations and Endeavours, in &s;uch Ways and Forms as the e&s;|tabli&s;hed Rules of the Con&s;titution pre&s;cribe or allow in order to make any Matters alledged to be Grievances appear to be really &s;uch; but I conceive it is rather the <HI>meer</HI> Exerci&s;e of this Au|thority which is complained of as a Grievance, than any heavy Burdens which have been bro't upon the People by Means of it.</P>
<P>As Contentment and Order were the happy Effects of a Con&s;titution &s;trengthened by univer|&s;al A&s;&s;ent and Approbation, &s;o Di&s;content and Di&s;|order are now the deplorable Effects of a Con|&s;titution enfeebled by Conte&s;t and Oppo&s;ition. Be&s;ides Divi&s;ions and Animo&s;itics which di&s;|turb the Peace of Towns and Families, the Law in &s;ome important Ca&s;es cannot have its Cour&s;e,&mdash;Offenders ordered by Advice of His Maje&s;ty's Council to be pro&s;ecuted, e&s;cape with Impunity and are &s;upported and encouraged to go on of|fending,&mdash;the Authority of Government is bro't into Contempt, and there are but &s;mall Remains of that Subordination which was once very con|&s;picuous in this Colony, and which is e&s;&s;ential to a well-regulated State.</P>
<P>When the Bands of Government are thus weak|ened, it certainly behoves tho&s;e with whom the Powers of Government are intru&s;ted to omit no|thing which may tend to &s;trengthen them.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="012856_0012_0F8B9530621737F8">

If my Principles of Government are right let us adhere to them. With the &s;ame Prin|ciples our Ance&s;tors were ea&s;y and happy for a long Cour&s;e of Years together, and I know of no Rea&s;on to doubt of your being equally ea&s;y &amp; hap|py. The People, influenced by you will for&s;ake their uncon&s;titutional Principles and de&s;i&s;t from their Irregularities which are the Con&s;equence of them, they will be convinced that every Thing which is valuable to them depend upon their Con|nexion with their Parent State, that this Connex|ion cannot be continued in any other Way than &s;uch as will al&s;o continue their Dependance upon the &s;upreme Authority of the Briti&s;h Dominions, and that, notwith&s;tanding this Dependance, they will enjoy as great a Proportion of tho&s;e Rights to which they have a Claim by Nature or as Eng|li&s;hmen as can be enjoyed by a Plantation or Co|lony.</P>

<HEAD>ON the 25th of January William Brattle, Harri&s;on Gray, James Pitts, James Humphrey, and Benjamin Greenleaf, E&s;quires, a Committee of his Maje&s;ty's Council, waited on the Governor with an An&s;wer to the foregoing SPEECH, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Board have con&s;idered your Excellen|cy's Speech to both Hou&s;es with the At|tention due to the Subject of it; and we hope with the Candour you are plea&s;ed to recommend to them.</P>
<P>We thank you for the Promi&s;e, that "if we &s;hall not agree with you in Sentiments, you will with Candour likewi&s;e, receive and con&s;ider what we may offer in An&s;wer."</P>
<P>Your Speech informs the two Hou&s;es that this Government is at pre&s;ent in a di&s;turbed and di&s;|ordered State; that the Cau&s;e of this Di&s;order is the uncon&s;titutional Principles adopted by the People in que&s;tioning the Supreme Authority of Parliament; and that the proper Mea&s;ure for removing the Di&s;order mu&s;t be the &s;ub&s;tituting contrary Principles.</P>
<P>Our Opinion on the&s;e Heads, as well as on &s;ome others proper to be noticed, will be obvious in the Cour&s;e of the following Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="012856_0015_0F8B95325F2674F0">
With regard to the pre&s;ent di&s;ordered State of the Government, it can have no Reference to Tumults or Riots: from which this Govern|ment is as free as any other whatever. If your Excellency meant only that the Province is di&s;|contented, and in a State of Unea&s;ine&s;s, we &s;hould intirely agree with you; but you will permit us to &s;ay we are not &s;o well agreed in the Cau&s;e of it. The Unea&s;ine&s;s, which was a general one through|out the Colonies, began when you inform us the Authority of Parliament was fir&s;t called in Que&s;|tion, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> about &s;even or eight Years ago. Your mentioning that particular Time might have &s;ug|ge&s;ted to your Excellency the true Cau&s;e of the Origin and Continuance of that Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>At that Time the Stamp-Act, then lately made, began to operate: Which with &s;ome pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ceeding and &s;ucceeding Acts of Parliament, &s;ubjecting the Colonies to Taxes without their Con&s;ent, was the original Cau&s;e of all the Unea&s;ine&s;s that has hap|pened &s;ince; and has occa&s;ioned al&s;o an Enquiry into the Nature and Extent of the Authority by which they were made. The late Town-Meet|ings in &s;everal Towns are In&s;tances of both. The&s;e are mentioned by your Excellency in Proof of a di&s;ordered State: But tho' we do not approve &s;ome of their Re&s;olves, we think they had a clear Right to in&s;truct their Repre&s;entatives on any Sub|ject they apprehended to be of &s;ufficient Impor|tance to require it: which nece&s;&s;arily implies a previous Con&s;ideration of, and Expre&s;&s;ion of their Minds on, that Subject: however mi&s;taken they may be concerning it.</P>

So far as any of an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">trocious Nature have taken Place, we would expre&s;s our Abhorrence of them: and as we have always done hitherto, we &s;hall continue to do, every Thing in our Power to di&s;|courage and &s;uppre&s;s them. But it is in vain to hope that this can be done effectually &s;o long as the Cau&s;e of the Unea&s;ine&s;s, which occa&s;ioned them, exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Your Excellency will perceive that the Cau&s;e you a&s;&s;ign is by us &s;uppo&s;ed to be an Effect deri|ved from the original Cau&s;e abovementioned: the Removal of which will remove its Effects.</P>
<P>To obtain this Removal, we agree with you in the Method pointed out in your Speech, where you &s;ay, "the Manner of obtaining Redre&s;s mu&s;t be by Repre&s;entations and Endeavours in &s;uch Ways and Forms as the Con&s;titution allows, in order to make any Matters alledged to be Grie|vances appear to be really &s;uch." This Method has been pur&s;ued repeatedly. Petitions to Par|liament have gone from the Colonies, and from this Colony in particular; but without Succe&s;s. Some of them, in a former Mini&s;try, were previ|ou&s;ly &s;hewn to the Mini&s;ter, who (as we have been informed) advi&s;ed the Agents to po&s;tpone pre&s;enting them to the Hou&s;e of Commons 'till the fir&s;t reading of the Bill they refer'd to: when being pre&s;ented, a Rule of the Hou&s;e again&s;t receiving Petitions on Money Bills was urged for
<PB N="18" REF="012856_0017_0F8B9533C0705DA0">
the rejecting of them, and they were rejected ac|cordingly: And other Petitions for want of For|mality, or whatever was the Rea&s;on, have had the &s;ame Fate. This we mention, not by Way of Cen&s;ure on that honourable Hou&s;e, but in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to account for the Conduct of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who de&s;pairing of Redre&s;s in a con&s;titu|tional Way, have denied the ju&s;t Authority of Parliament: concerning which we &s;hall now give our own Sentiments, intermixt with Ob&s;ervations on tho&s;e of your Excellency.</P>
<P>You are plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that "when our Predece&s;&s;ors fir&s;t took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Colony, under a Grant and Charter from the Crown of England, it was their Sen&s;e, and it was the Sen&s;e of the Kingdom, that they were to remain Subject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament." And to prove that Subjection the greater Part of your Speech is employed.</P>
<P>In order to a right Conception of this Matter, it is nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t any improper Idea of the term <HI>Supreme</HI> Authority. In your Idea of it your Excellency &s;eems to include <HI>unlimited</HI> Authority: for you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, you "know of no Line that can be drawn between the Supreme Authority of Parliament and the total Independence of the Colonies:" But if no &s;uch Line can be drawn a Denial of that Authority in any In&s;tance whatever implies and amounts to a Declaration of total Independence. But if Su|preme Authority includes unlimited Authority, the Subjects of it are emphatically Slaves: and equally &s;o whether re&s;iding in the Colonies or
<PB N="19" REF="012856_0018_0F8B953485CD13B0">
Great-Britain. And indeed in this Re&s;pect all the Nations on Earth, among whom Govern|ment exi&s;ts in any of its Forms, would be alike conditioned: excepting &s;o far as the mere Grace and Favor of their Governors might make a Dif|ference; "for from the Nature of Government there mu&s;t be, as your Excellency has ob&s;erved, one Supreme Authority over the whole."</P>
<P>We cannot think, "that when our Predece&s;&s;ors fir&s;t took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Colony it was their Sen&s;e, or the Sen&s;e of the Kingdom, that they were to remain Subject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament" if this Idea of it. Nor can we find that this appears from the Charter; or that &s;uch Authority has ever been exerci&s;ed by Parlia|ment, &s;ubmitted to by the Colony, or acknow|ledged by the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Supreme or unlimited Authority can with Fit|ne&s;s belong only to the Sovereign of the Univer&s;e: And that Fitne&s;s is derived from the Perfection of his Nature.&mdash;To &s;uch Authority, directed by infi|nite Wi&s;dom &amp; infinite Goodne&s;s, is due both active and pa&s;&s;ive Obedience: Which, as it con&s;titutes the Happine&s;s of rational Creatures, &s;hould with Chearfulne&s;s and from Choice be unlimitedly paid by them.&mdash;But with Truth this can be &s;aid of no other Authority whatever. If then from the Na|ture and End of Government, the &s;upreme Au|thority of every Government is limited, the Su|preme Authority of Parliament mu&s;t be limited; and the Enquiry will be what are the Limits of that Authority with Regard to this Colony?&mdash;To fix them with Preci&s;ion, to determine the exact

Lines of Right and Wrong in this Ca&s;e, as in &s;ome others, is difficult; and we have not the Pre&s;ump|tion to attempt it. But we humbly hope, that as we are per&s;onally and relatively, in our private and public Capacities, for our&s;elves, for the whole Province, and for all Po&s;terity, &s;o deeply inte|re&s;ted in this important Subject, it will not be deemed Arrogance to give &s;ome general Senti|ments upon it, e&s;pecially as your Excellency's Speech has made it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e we &s;hall recur to tho&s;e Re|cords that contain the main Principles on which the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution is founded; and from them make &s;uch Extracts as are pertinent to the Subject.</P>
<P>Magna Charta declares, "that no Aid &s;hall be impo&s;ed in the Kingdom, unle&s;s by the Com|mon Council of the Kingdom, except to redeem the King's Per&s;on, &amp;c". And that "all Cities, Boroughs, Towns and Ports &s;hall have their Li|berties and free Cu&s;toms; and &s;hall have the Common Council of the Kingdom concerning the A&s;&s;e&s;sment of their Aids, except in the Ca&s;es afore&s;aid."</P>
<P>The Statute of the 34th of Edward I, de tal|lagio non concedendo, declares, "that no T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l|lage or Aid &s;hould be laid or levied by the King or his Heirs in the Realm, without the Good Will and A&s;&s;ent of the Arch Bi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Earls Barons, Knights, Burge&s;&s;es, and other the Free|men of the Commonalty of this Realm."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="012856_0020_0F8B9536118EDB98">
A Statute of the 25 Ed. 3, enacts "that from thenceforth no Per&s;on &s;hall be compelled to make any Loans, to the King again&s;t his Will, becau&s;e &s;uch Loans were again&s;t Rea&s;on and the Franchi&s;e of the Land."</P>
<P>The Petition of Rights in the 3d of Charles 1&s;t, in which are cited the two foregoing Statutes, declares that by tho&s;e "Statutes, and other good Laws and Statutes of the Realm, his Maje&s;ty's Subjects inherited this Freedom, that they &s;hould not be compelled to contribute to any Tax, Tallage, Aid, or other like Charge, not &s;ett by common Con&s;ent of Parliament." And the Statute of the I. of William 3d, for declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject and &s;etling the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown declares, "That the levying of Money for or to the U&s;e of the Crown, by Pretence of Prerogative without Grant of Par|liament, for longer Time, or in any other Manner than the &s;ame is or &s;hall be granted, is illegal."</P>
<P>From the&s;e Authorities it appears an e&s;&s;ential Part of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, that no Tallage or Aid or Tax &s;hall be laid or levied "without the Good Will and A&s;&s;ent of the Freemen of the Commonalty of the Realm." If this could be done without their A&s;&s;ent, their Property would be in the highe&s;t Degree precarious: or rather they could not with Fitne&s;s be &s;aid to have any Property at all. At be&s;t they would be only the Holders of it for the U&s;e of the Crown; and the Crown be in Fact the real Proprietor. This would be Va&s;&s;allage in the extreme; from which the generous Nature of Engli&s;hmen has been &s;o
<PB N="22" REF="012856_0021_0F8B953A1DB168F0">
abhorrent, that they have bled with Freedom in the Defence of this Part of their Con&s;titution, which has pre&s;erved them from it: and influen|ced by the &s;ame Genero&s;ity, they can never view with Di&s;approbation any lawful Mea&s;ures taken by us for the Defence of our Con&s;titution, which intitles us to the &s;ame Rights and Privileges with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The&s;e were derived to us from Common Law, which is the Inheritance of all his Maje&s;ty's Sub|jects; have been recognized by Acts of Parlia|ment; and confirmed by the Province Charter, which e&s;tabli&s;hed its Con&s;titution; and which Charter has been recognized by Act of Parliament al&s;o. This Act was made in the &s;econd Year of his late Maje&s;ty GEO. II, for the better Pre&s;erva|tion of his Maje&s;ty's Woods in America: in which is recited the Clau&s;e of the &s;aid Charter re&s;erving for the U&s;e of the Royal Navy all Trees &s;uita|ble for Ma&s;ts: and on this Charter is grounded the &s;ucceeding enacting Clau&s;e of the Act. And thus is the Charter implicitly confirmed by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>From all which it appears, that the Inhabitants of this Colony are clearly intitled to All the Rights and Privileges of free and natural Sub|jects: which certainly mu&s;t include that mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential one, that no Aid or Taxes be levied on them without their own Con&s;ent, &s;ignified by their Repre&s;entatives. But from the Clau&s;e in the Charter relative to the Power granted to the Ge|neral Court to make Laws, not repugnant to the Laws of England, your Excellency draws this
<PB N="23" REF="012856_0022_0F8B953AE26F71E8">
Inference, that "&s;urely this is by Charter a Re|&s;erve of Power and Authority to Parliament to bind us by &s;uch Laws, at lea&s;t, as are made ex|pre&s;sly to refer to us, and con&s;equently is a Li|mitation of the Power given to the General Court."&mdash;If it be allowed that by that, Clau&s;e there was a Re&s;erve of Power to Parliament to bind the Province, it was only by &s;uch Laws as were in Being at the Time the Charter was grant|ed: for by the Charter there is nothing appears to make it refer to any Parliamentary Laws, that &s;hould be afterwards made, and therefore it will not &s;upport your Excellency's Inference.</P>
<P>The Grant of Power to the General Court to make Laws runs thus,&mdash;"full Power and Autho|rity, from Time to Time, to make, ordain and e&s;tabli&s;h all Manner of whole&s;ome and rea&s;onable Orders, Laws, Statutes and Ordinances, Direc|tions and In&s;tructions, either with Penalties or without (&s;o as the fame be not repugnant or con|trary to the Laws of this our Realm of England) as they &s;hall judge to be for the Good and Wel|fare of our &s;aid Province." &amp;c.&mdash;We humbly think an Inference very different from your Ex|cellency's, and a very ju&s;t one too, may be drawn from this Clau&s;e, if Attention be given to the De|&s;cription of the Orders and Laws that were to be made.&mdash;They were to be whole&s;ome, rea&s;onable and for the Good and Welfare of the Province, and in order that they might be &s;o, it is provid|ed that they be "not repugnant or contrary to the Laws of the Realm," that were then in be|ing: by which Provi&s;o, all the Liberties and Im|munities of free and natural Subjects within the
<PB N="24" REF="012856_0023_0F8B953B388D91D0">
Realm were more effectually &s;ecured to the Inha|bitants of the Province agreeable to another Clau&s;e in the Charter, whereby tho&s;e Liberties and Im|munities are expre&s;sly granted to them: and ac|cordingly the Power of the General Court is &s;o far limited, that they &s;hall not make Orders and Laws to take away or dimini&s;h tho&s;e Liberties and Immunities.</P>
<P>This Con&s;truction appears to us a ju&s;t one, and perhaps may appear &s;o to your Excellency if you will plea&s;e to con&s;ider, that by another Part of the Charter effectual Care was taken for prevent|ing the General A&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ing of Orders and Laws repugnant to, or that in any Way might mi|litate with Acts of Parliament then or &s;ince made; or that might-be exceptionable in any other Re&s;|pect whatever: for the Charter re&s;erves to his Maje&s;ty the Appointment of the Governor, who&s;e A&s;&s;ent is nece&s;&s;ary in the pa&s;&s;ing of all Orders and Laws: after which they are to be &s;ent to Eng|land for the Royal Approbation or Di&s;allowance: by which double Controul effectual Care is taken to prevent the E&s;tabli&s;hment of any improper Or|ders or Laws whatever.&mdash;Be&s;ides, your Excel|lency is &s;en&s;ible that "Letters Patent mu&s;t be con&s;trued one Part with another, and all the Parts of them together, &s;o as to make the whole har|monize and agree. But your Excellency's Con|&s;truction of the Paragraph impowering the Gene|ral Court to make Orders and Laws, does by no means harmonize and agree with the Paragraph granting Liberties and Immunities; and therefore we humbly conceive is not to be admitted: Whereas on the other Con&s;truction there is a per|fect
<PB N="25" REF="012856_0024_0F8B953C42434110">
Harmony and Agreement between them. But &s;uppo&s;ing your Excellency's Inference ju&s;t, that by the &s;aid former Paragraph (con&s;idered by it&s;elf) are re&s;erved to Parliament Power and Au|thority to bind us by Laws made expre&s;sly to re|fer to us. Does it con&s;i&s;t with Ju&s;tice and Equity that it &s;hould be con&s;idered apart, and urged a|gain&s;t the People of this Province with all its Force and without Limitation, and at the &s;ame Time the other Paragraph which they thought &s;ecured to them the e&s;&s;ential Rights and Privile|ges of free and natural Subjects be rendered of no Validity? If the former Paragraph (in this &s;up|po&s;ed ca&s;e) be binding on this People, the latter mu&s;t be binding on the Crown, which thereby became Guarantee of tho&s;e Rights and Privile|ges. Or it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that one Party is held by a Compact, and the other not: Which Suppo&s;ition is again&s;t Rea&s;on and again&s;t Law; and therefore de&s;troys the Foundation of the Infer|ence. However, &s;uppo&s;ing it well founded, it would not from thence follow, that the Charter intended &s;uch Laws as &s;hould &s;ubject the Inhabi|tants of the Province to Taxes without their Con&s;ent: For (as appears above) it grants to them all the Rights and Liberties of free and natural Subjects: Of which one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential is a Freedom from all Taxes not con&s;ented to by them&s;elves.&mdash;Nor could the Parties, either Grantor or Grantees, intend &s;uch Laws. The Royal Grantor could not, becau&s;e his Grant con|tradicts &s;uch Intention; and becau&s;e it is incon|&s;i&s;tent with every Idea of Royalty and royal Wi&s;|dom, to grant what it does not intend to grant. And it will be readily allowed that the Grantees
<PB N="26" REF="012856_0025_0F8B953CBB75D510">
could not intend &s;uch Laws, not only on account of their Incon&s;i&s;tency with the Grant, but becau&s;e their Acceptance of a Charter, &s;ubjecting them to &s;uch Laws, would be voluntary Slavery.</P>
<P>Your Excellenny next ob&s;erves, "that it can|not be contended that by the Liberties of free and natural Subjects is to be under&s;tood an Exemption from Acts of Parliament, becau&s;e not repre&s;ented there, &s;eeing it is provided by the &s;ame Charter, that &s;uch Acts &s;hall be in Force."&mdash;If the Ob|&s;ervations we have made above, and our Rea&s;oning on them be Ju&s;t, it will appear that no &s;uch Pro|vi&s;ion is made in the Charter, and therefore that the Deductions and Inferences derived from the Suppo&s;ition of &s;uch Provi&s;ion, are not well found|ed. And with Re&s;pect to Repre&s;entation in Par|liament, as it is one of the e&s;&s;ential Liberties of free and natural Subjects, and properly makes tho&s;e who enjoy it liable to Parliamentary Acts, &s;o in Reference to the Inhabitants of this Province, who are intitled to all the Liberties of &s;uch Sub|jects, the Impo&s;&s;ibility of their being duely re|pre&s;ented in Parliament, does clearly exempt them from all &s;uch Acts at lea&s;t, as have been or &s;hall be made by Parliament to Tax them: Repre&s;en|tation and Taxation being in our Opinion con&s;ti|tutionally in&s;eperable.</P>
<P>"This Grant of Liberties and Immunities, your Excellency informs us, is nothing more than a Declaration and A&s;&s;urance on the Part of the Crown, that the Place to which our Predece&s;&s;ors were about to remove, was and would be con&s;i|dered as Part of the Dominions of the Crown,
<PB N="27" REF="012856_0026_0F8B9540E678B970">
and therefore that the Subjects &s;o removing would not become Aliens, but would, both without and within the Colony retain the Liberties and Im|munities of free and natural Subjects."</P>
<P>The Dominion of the Crown over this Coun|try before the Arrival of our Predece&s;&s;ors was meerly ideal. Their Removal hither realized that Dominion, and has made the Country valu|able both to the Crown and Nation, without any Co&s;t to either of them from that Time to this. Even in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State of our Prede|ce&s;&s;ors, when they expected to be de&s;troyed by a general Con&s;piracy and Incur&s;ion of the Indian Natives, they had no A&s;&s;i&s;tance from them. This Grant then of Liberties, which is the only Con|&s;ideration they received from the Crown for &s;o valuable an Acqui&s;ition to it, in&s;tead of being vio|lated by military Power, or explained away by nice Inferences and Di&s;tinctions, ought in Ju&s;tice, and with a generous Openne&s;s and Freedom, to be acknowledged by every Mini&s;ter of the Crown, and pre&s;erved &s;acred from every Species of Vio|lation.</P>
<P>"If the Plantation be Part of the Dominions of the Crown this Clau&s;e in the Charter (grant|ing Liberties and Immunities) does not, your Ex|cellency ob&s;erves, confer or re&s;erve any Liberties but what would have been enjoyed without it; and what the Inhabitants of every other Colony do enjoy, where they are without a Charter."&mdash;Although the Colonies con&s;idered as Part of the Dominions of the Crown are intitled to equal Liberties, the Inhabitants of this Colony think it
<PB N="28" REF="012856_0027_0F8B9541A36A4CA8">
a Happine&s;s, that tho&s;e Liberties are confirmed and &s;ecured to them by a Charter; whereby the Honour and Faith of the Crown are pledged, that tho&s;e Liberties &s;hall not be violated. And for Protection in them we humbly look up to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, our rightful and lawful Sovereign, as Children to a Father, able and di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t and relieve them; humbly imploring his Maje&s;ty, that his Subjects of this Province, ever faithful and loyal, and ever accounted &s;uch till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Stamp-Act exi&s;ted, and who in the late War, and upon all other Occa&s;ions, have demon&s;trated that Faith|fulne&s;s and Loyalty by their vigorous and unex|ampled Exertions in his Service, may have their Grievances redre&s;&s;ed, and be re&s;tored to their ju&s;t Rights.</P>
<P>Your Excellency next ob&s;erves "that it is im|po&s;&s;ible the Rights of Engli&s;h Subjects &s;hould be the &s;ame in every Re&s;pect, in all Parts of the Dominions," and In&s;tances in the Right of being "governed by Laws made by Per&s;ons, in who&s;e Election they have a Voice." When "they re|move from the Kingdom to the Plantations where it cannot be enjoyed," you a&s;k, "will it not be &s;aid, that by this their voluntary Removal, they have relinqui&s;hed, for a Time at lea&s;t, one of the Rights of an Engli&s;h Subject, which they might if they plea&s;ed, have continued to enjoy, and may again enjoy when&s;oever they will return to the Place where it can be exerci&s;ed."</P>
<P>When Engli&s;h Subjects remove from the King|dom to the Plantations with their Properties, they not only relinqui&s;h that Right <HI>de facto,</HI> but it
<PB N="29" REF="012856_0028_0F8B9543E1702A58">
ought to cea&s;e in the Kingdom <HI>de jure.</HI> But it does not from thence follow, that they relinqui&s;h that Right, in Reference to the Plantation or Colony to which they remove. On the contrary, being become Inhabitants of that Colony, and qualified according to the Laws of it, they can exerci&s;e that Right equally with the other Inha|bitants of it. And this Right, on like Conditi|ons, will travel with them through all the Colo|nies, wherein a Legi&s;lature, &s;imilar to that of the Kingdom, is e&s;tabli&s;hed. And therefore in this Re&s;pect, and we &s;uppo&s;e in all other e&s;&s;ential Re&s;pects, it is not impo&s;&s;ible the Rights of Engli&s;h Subjects &s;hould be the &s;ame in all Parts of the Dominions" under a like Form of Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>This Right of Repre&s;entation is &s;o e&s;&s;ential and indi&s;pen&s;ible in Regard of all Laws for levy|ing Taxes, that a People under any Form of Go|vernment de&s;titute of it, is de&s;titute of Freedom&mdash;of that Degree of Freedom, for the Pre&s;erva|tion of which, Government was in&s;tituted; and without which, Government degenerates to De&s;|poti&s;m. It cannot therefore be given up, or taken away, without making a Breach on the e&s;&s;ential Rights of Nature.</P>
<P>But your Excellency is plea&s;ed to &s;ay&punc; that they "who claim Exemption as Part of their Rights by Nature, &s;hould con&s;ider that every Re&s;traint which Men are laid under by a State of Govern|ment, is a Privation of Part of their natural Rights. Even in Ca&s;e of Repre&s;entation by Election, do they not give up Part of their natural Rights, when they con&s;ent to be repre&s;ented by &s;uch
<PB N="30" REF="012856_0029_0F8B954466700EB0">
Per&s;ons as &s;hall be cho&s;en by the Majority of the Electors, although their own Voices may be for &s;ome other Per&s;on? And is it not contrary to their natural Rights to be obliged to &s;ubmit to a Repre&s;entative for &s;even Years, or even one Year, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fter they are di&s;&s;atisfied with his Conduct, al|though they gave their Voices for him, when he was elected? This mu&s;t therefore be con&s;idered as an Objection again&s;t a State of Government rather than again&s;t any particular Form."</P>
<P>Your Excellency's Premi&s;&s;es are true, but we do not think your Conclu&s;ion follows from them. It is true, that every Re&s;traint of Government is a Privation of natural Right: and the two Ca&s;es you have been plea&s;ed to mention, may be In|&s;tances of that Privation. But as they ari&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the Nature of Society and Government; and as Government is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure other natural Rights infinitely more valuable, they cannot therefore be con&s;idered as an Objection either "again&s;t a State of Government" or "again&s;t any particular Form of it."</P>
<P>Life, Liberty, Property, and the Di&s;po&s;al of that Property with our own Con&s;ent, are natural Rights. Will any one put the other in Compe|tition with the&s;e, or infer that becau&s;e tho&s;e other mu&s;t be given up in a State of Government, the&s;e mu&s;t be given up al&s;o? The Pre&s;ervation of the&s;e Rights is the great End of Government: but is it probable they will be effectually &s;ecured by a Governor, which the Proprietors of them have no Part in the Direction of, and over which they have no Power or Influence whatever?
<PB N="31" REF="012856_0030_0F8B9544F6B789B0">
Hence is deducible, Repre&s;entation: which being nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the&s;e invaluable Rights of Nature, is it&s;elf, for that Rea&s;on, a natural Right, coinciding with, and running into, that great Law of Nature, Self-Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Thus have we con&s;idered the mo&s;t material Parts of your Speech, and agreeable to your De|&s;ire di&s;clo&s;ed to you our Sentiments on the Sub|ject of it.</P>

<P>We have the highe&s;t Re&s;pect for that augu&s;t Body the Parliament, and do not pre&s;ume to pre&s;cribe the exact Limits of its Authority, yet with the Deference that is due to it, we are humbly of Opinion, that as all human Authority in the Nature of it, is and ought to be limited, it cannot con&s;titutionally extend, for the Rea&s;ons we have above &s;ugge&s;ted, to the levying of Taxes in any Form, on his Maje&s;ty's Subjects of this Province.</P>

<HEAD>AND on the 26th of January the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives &s;ent up to his Excel|lency their An&s;wer, by Mr. Adams, Mr. Hancock, Mr. Bacon, Col. Bowers, Major Hawley, Capt. Derby, Mr. Phillips, Col. Thayer, and Col. Stock|bridge.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Excellency's Speech to the General A&s;&s;embly at the Opening of this Se&s;&s;ion, has been read with great Attention in this Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We fully agree with your Excellency, that our own Happine&s;s as well as his Maje&s;ty's Service, very much depends upon Peace and Order; and we &s;hall at all Times take &s;uch Mea&s;ures as are con&s;i&s;tent with our Con&s;titution and the Rights of the People to promote and maintain them. That the Government at pre&s;ent is in a very di&s;turbed State is apparent! But we cannot a&s;cribe it to the People's having adopted uncon&s;titutional Princi|ples, which &s;eems to be the Cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned for it by your Excellency. It appears to us to have been occa&s;ioned rather, by the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons a&s;&s;uming and exerci&s;ing a Power incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Freedom of the Con&s;titution, to give and grant the Property of the Coloni&s;ts, and appropriate the &s;ame without their Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s for us to enquire what were the Principles that induced the Councils of the Nation to &s;o new and unprecedented a Mea&s;ure. But when the Parliament by an Act of their own ex|pre&s;ly
<PB N="34" REF="012856_0033_0F8B954A494B6500">
declared, that the King, Lords and Com|mons of the Nation "have, ever had, and of Right ought to have full Power and Authority to make Laws and Statutes of &s;ufficient Force and Validity to bind the Colonies and People of America, Sub|jects of the Crown of Great-Britain, in all Ca&s;es whatever," and in Con&s;equence hereof another Revenue Act was made, the Minds of the People were filled with Anxiety, and they were ju&s;tly alarmed with Apprehen&s;ions of the total Extinc|tion of their Liberties.</P>
<P>The Re&s;ult of the free Enquiries of many Per&s;ons into the Right of the Parliament to ex|erci&s;e &s;uch a Power over the Colonies, &s;eems in your Excellency's Opinion, to be the Cau&s;e of what you are plea&s;ed to call the pre&s;ent "di&s;|turbed State of the Government;" upon which you "may not any longer con&s;i&s;tent with your Duty to the King, and your Regard to the Intere&s;t of the Province, delay communicating your Sen|timents." But that the Principles adopted in Con|&s;equence hereof, are uncon&s;titutional, is a Subject of Enquiry. We know of no &s;uch Di&s;orders ari&s;ing therefrom as are mentioned by your Ex|cellency. If Grand Jurors have not on their Oaths found &s;uch Offences, as your Excellency with the Advice of his Maje&s;ty's Council have <HI>ordered</HI> to be pro&s;ecuted, it is to be pre&s;umed they have followed the Dictates of good Con&s;ci|ence. <HI>They</HI> are the con&s;titutional Judges of the&s;e Matters; and it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that moved from corrupt Principles, they have &s;uffered Offenders to e&s;cape a Pro&s;ecution, and thus &s;up|ported and encouraged them to go on offending.
<PB N="35" REF="012856_0034_0F8B954B0027CB80">
If any Part of Authority, &s;hall in an uncon&s;ti|tutional Manner, interpo&s;e in any Matter, it will be no wonder if it be brought into Contempt; to the le&s;&s;ening or confounding of that Subordi|nation which is nece&s;&s;ary to a well regulated State. Your Excellency's Repre&s;entation that the Bands of Government are weakened, we humbly conceive to be without good Grounds; though we mu&s;t own the heavy Burthens uncon|&s;titutionally brought upon the People have been and &s;till are univer&s;ally and very ju&s;tly com|plained of as a Grievance.</P>
<P>You are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that "when our Prede|ce&s;&s;ors fir&s;t took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Plantation or Colony, under a Grant and Charter from the Crown of England, it was their Sen&s;e, and it was the Sen&s;e of the Kingdom, that they were to re|main &s;ubject to the Supreme Authority of Par|liament;" whereby we under&s;tand your Excel|lency to mean in the Sen&s;e of the Declaratory Act of Parliament aforementioned, in all Ca&s;es whatever. And indeed it is difficult, if po&s;&s;ible, to draw a Line of Di&s;tinction between the uni|ver&s;al Authority of Parliament over the Colonies, and no Authority at all. It is therefore nece&s;&s;a|ry for us to enquire how it appears, for your Ex|cellency has not &s;hown it to us, that when or at the Time that our Predece&s;&s;ors took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Plantation or Colony, under a Grant and Charter from the Crown of England, it was <HI>their Sen&s;e,</HI> and the Sen&s;e of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> that they were to remain &s;ubject to the Supreme Authority of Par|liament. In making this Enquiry, we &s;hall, ac|cording to your Excellency's Recommendation,
<PB N="36" REF="012856_0035_0F8B954BB7B513F0">
treat the Subject with Calmne&s;s and Candor, and al&s;o with a due Regard to Truth.</P>
<P>Previous to a direct Con&s;ideration of the Char|ter granted to this Province or Colony, and the better to elucidate the true Sen&s;e and Meaning of it, we would take a View of the State of the En|gli&s;h North American Continent at the Time when and after Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was fir&s;t taken of any Part of it, by the Europeans. It was then po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by Heathen and Barbarous People, who had neverthele&s;s all that Right to the Soil and Sovereignty in and over the Lands they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, which God had originally given to Man. Whe|ther their being Heathen, inferred any Right or Authority to Chri&s;tian Princes, a Right which had long been a&s;&s;umed by the Pope, to di&s;po&s;e of their Lands to others, we will leave to your Ex|cellency or any one of Under&s;tanding and impar|tial Judgment to con&s;ider. It is certain they had in no other Sen&s;e forfeited them to any Power in Europe. Should the Doctrine be admitted that Di&s;covery of Lands owned and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Pagan People, gives to any Chri&s;tian Prince a Right and Title to the Dominion and Property, &s;till it is ve&s;ted in the Crown alone. It was an Acqui&s;i|tion of Foreign Territory, not annexed to the Realm of England, and therefore at the ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al of the Crown. For we take it to be a &s;ettled Point, that the King has a con&s;titutional Prerogative to di&s;po&s;e of and alienate any Part of his Territories not annexed to the Realm. In the Exerci&s;e of this Prerogative, Queen Elizabeth granted the fir&s;t American Charter; and claiming a Right by Virtue of Di&s;covery, then &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="37" REF="012856_0036_0F8B954C78D89CC0">
to be valid, to the Lands which are now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Colony of Virginia, &s;he conveyed to Sir Walter Rawleigh, the Property, Dominion and Sovereignty thereof, to be held of the Crown by Homage, and a certain Render, without any Re&s;ervation to her&s;elf of any Share in the Legi|&s;lative and Executive Authority. After the At|tainder of Sir Walter, King James the Fir&s;t cre|ated two Virginia Companies, to be governed each by Laws tran&s;mitted to them by his Maje&s;ty, and not by the Parliament, with Power to e&s;tabli&s;h and cau&s;e to be made a Coin to pa&s;s current a|mong them; and ve&s;ted with all Liberties, Fran|chi&s;es and Immunities within any of his other Dominions, to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, as if they had been abiding, and born <HI>within the Realm.</HI> A Declaration &s;imilar to this is contained in the fir&s;t Charter of this Colony, and in tho&s;e of other American Colonies; which &s;hows that the Colonies were not intended or con&s;idered to be within the Realm of England, though within the Allegiance of the Engli&s;h Crown. After this, another Charter was granted by the &s;ame King James, to the Trea&s;urer and Company of Vir|ginia, ve&s;ting them with full Power and Authority, to make, ordain and e&s;tabli&s;h all Manner of Or|ders, Laws, Directions, In&s;tructions, Forms and Ceremonies of Government and Magi&s;tracy, fit and nece&s;&s;ary, and the &s;ame to abrogate, &amp;c. without any Re&s;ervation for &s;ecuring their Subjection to the Parliament and future Laws of England. A third Charter was afterwards granted by the &s;ame King to the Trea&s;urer and Company of Virginia, ve&s;ting them with Power and Authority to make Laws, with an Addition of this Clau&s;e, "&s;o al|ways
<PB N="38" REF="012856_0037_0F8B954D63797F48">
that the &s;ame be not contrary to the Laws and Statutes of this our Realm of England." The &s;ame Clau&s;e was afterwards copied into the Charter of this and other Colonies, with certain Variations, &s;uch as that the&s;e Laws &s;hould be "con&s;onant to Rea&s;on," "not repugnant to the Laws of England," "as nearly as conveniently may be to the Laws, Statutes and Rights of Eng|land." &amp;c. The&s;e Modes of Expre&s;&s;ion convey the &s;ame Meaning, and &s;erve to &s;how an Intention that the Laws of the Colonies &s;hould be as much as po&s;&s;ible, conformant in the Spirit of them to the Principles and fundamental Laws of the Eng|li&s;h Con&s;titution&punc; its Rights and Statutes then in Being; and by no Means to bind the Colonies to a Subjection to the Supreme Authority of the Engli&s;h Parliament. And that this is the true Intention, we think it further evident from this Con&s;ideration, that no Acts of any Colony Legi|&s;lative, are ever brought into Parliament for In|&s;pection there, though the Laws made in &s;ome of them, like the Acts of the Briti&s;h Parliament are laid before the King for his A&s;&s;ent or Di&s;allow|ance.</P>
<P>We have brought the fir&s;t American Charters into View, and the State of the Country when they were granted, to &s;how that the Right of di&s;|po&s;ing of the Lands was in the Opinion of tho&s;e Times ve&s;ted &s;olely in the Crown&mdash;that the &s;eve|ral Charters conveyed to the Grantees, who &s;hould &s;ettle upon the Territories therein granted, all the Powers nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute them free and di&s;tinct States&mdash;and that the fundamental Laws of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution &s;hould be the certain
<PB N="39" REF="012856_0038_0F8B9551CBC8CCC8">
and e&s;tabli&s;hed Rule of Legi&s;lation, to which the Laws to be made in the &s;everal Colonies were to be as nearly as conveniently might be, conforma|ble or &s;imilar; which was the true Intent and Im|port of the Words, "not repugnant to the Laws of England," "con&s;onant to Rea&s;on," and other variant Expre&s;&s;ions in the different Charters. And we would add, that the King in &s;ome of the Charters re&s;erves the Right to judge of the Con|&s;onance and Similarity of their Laws with the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution to him&s;elf, and not to the Parliament; and in Con&s;equence thereof to affirm, or within a limited Time, di&s;allow them.</P>
<P>The&s;e Charters, as well as that afterwards granted to Lord Baltimore, and other Charters, are repugnant to the Idea of Parliamentary Au|thority: And to &s;uppo&s;e a Parliamentary Autho|rity over the Colonies under &s;uch Charters, would nece&s;&s;arily induce that Soleci&s;m in Politics <HI>Impe|rium in Imperio.</HI> And the King's repeatedly ex|erci&s;ing the Prerogative of di&s;po&s;ing of the Ame|rican Territory by &s;uch Charters, together with the Silence of the Nation thereupon, is an Evi|dence that it was an acknowledged Prerogative.</P>
<P>But further to &s;how the Sen&s;e of the Engli&s;h Crown and Nation that the American Coloni&s;ts and our Predece&s;&s;ors in particular, when they fir&s;t took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Country by a Grant and Charter from the Crown, did not remain &s;ubject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament, we beg Leave to ob&s;erve; that when a Bill was offered by the two Hou&s;es of Parliament to King Charles the Fir&s;t, granting to the Subjects of England the
<PB N="40" REF="012856_0039_0F8B9552868259F0">
free Liberty of Fi&s;hing on the Coa&s;t of America, he refu&s;ed his Royal A&s;&s;ent, declaring as a Rea|&s;on, that "the Colonies were <HI>without the Realm and Juri&s;diction of Parliament.</HI>"</P>
<P>In like Manner, his Predece&s;&s;or James the Fir&s;t, had before declared upon a &s;imilar Occa&s;ion, that America <HI>was not annexed to the Realm,</HI> and it was not fitting that Parliament &s;hould make Laws for tho&s;e Countries." This Rea&s;on was, not &s;ecret|ly, but openly declared in Parliament. If then the Colonies were not annexed to the Realm, at the Time when their Charters were granted, they never could be afterwards, without their own &s;pecial Con&s;ent, which has never &s;ince been had, or even a&s;ked. If they are not now annexed to the Realm, they are not a Part of the Kingdom, and con&s;equently not &s;ubject to the Legi&s;lative Authority of the Kingdom. For no Country, by the Common Law was &s;ubject to the Laws or to the Parliament, but the Realm of England.</P>
<P>We would if your Excellency plea&s;es, &s;ubjoin an In&s;tance of Conduct in King Charles the Se|cond, &s;ingular indeed, but important to our Pur|po&s;e; who, in 1679, framed an Act for a perma|nent Revenue for the Support of Virginia, and &s;ent it there by Lord Colpepper, the Governor of that Colony; which was afterwards pa&s;&s;ed into a Law, and <HI>"Enacted by the King's mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty, by and with the Con&s;ent of the General A&s;&s;embly of Virginia."</HI> If the King had judged that Colony to be a Part of the Realm, he would not, nor could he con&s;i&s;tently with Magna Char|ta, have placed him&s;elf at the Head of, and joined
<PB N="41" REF="012856_0040_0F8B955341AAC200">
with any Legi&s;lative Body in making a Law to Tax the People there, other than the Lords and Commons of England.</P>
<P>Having taken a View of the &s;everal Charters of the fir&s;t Colony in America, if we look into the old Charter of this Colony, we &s;hall find it to be grounded on the &s;ame Principle: That the Right of di&s;po&s;ing the Territory granted therein was ve&s;ted in the Crown, as being that Chri&s;tian Sovereign who fir&s;t di&s;covered it, when in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Heathen; and that it was con&s;idered as being not within the Realm, but only within the Fee and Seignory of the King. As therefore it was without the Realm of England, mu&s;t not the King, if he had de&s;igned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat the Parliament &s;hould have had any Authority over it, have made a &s;pecial Re&s;ervation for that Purpo&s;e? which was not done.</P>
<P>Your Excellency &s;ays, it appears from the Charter it&s;elf, to have been the Sen&s;e of our Predece&s;&s;ors who fir&s;t took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Plan|tation or Colony, that they were to remain &s;ub|ject to the Authority of Parliament. You have not been plea&s;ed to point out to us how this ap|pears from the Charter, unle&s;s it be in the Ob&s;er|vation you make on the above-mentioned Clau&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "That a favourable Con&s;truction has been put upon this Clau&s;e, when it has been allowed to intend &s;uch Laws of England only as are expre&s;ly made to re&s;pect us," which you &s;ay "is by Charter a Re&s;erve of Power and Authority to Par|liament to bind us by &s;uch Laws at lea&s;t as are made expre&s;ly to refer to us, and con&s;equently is
<PB N="42" REF="012856_0041_0F8B9553F98CA698">
a Limitation of the Power given to the General Court." But we would &s;till recur to the Char|ter it&s;elf, and a&s;k your Excellency, How this ap|pears from thence to have been the Sen&s;e of our Predece&s;&s;ors? Is any Re&s;ervation of Power and Authority to Parliament thus to bind us, expre&s;&s;|ed or implied in the Charter? It is evident, that King Charles the fir&s;t, the very Prince who granted it, as well as his Predece&s;&s;or, had no &s;uch Idea of the &s;upreme Authority of Parliament over the Colony&punc; from their Declarations before recited. Your Excellency will then allow us further to a&s;k, by what Authority in Rea&s;on or Equity the Parliament can enforce a Con&s;truction &s;o <HI>unfa|vourable</HI> to us. <HI>Quod ab initi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> inju&s;tum e&s;t, nul|lum pote&s;t habere juris effectum,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tius.</HI> Which with Submi&s;&s;ion to your Excellency may be rendered thus, <HI>Whatever is originally in its Nature wrong, can never be &s;atisfied or made right by Reputation and U&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;olemn Agreements &s;ub&s;equent Re&s;trictions ought never to be allowed. The celebrated Au|thor whom your Excellency has quoted, tells us that "neither the one or the other of the inter|e&s;ted or contracting Powers hath a right to inter|pret at Plea&s;ure." This we mention to &s;how, even upon a Suppo&s;ition that the Parliament had been a Party to the Contract, the Invalidity of any of its &s;ub&s;equent Acts, to explain any Clau&s;e in the Charter; more e&s;pecially to re&s;trict or make void any Clau&s;e granted therein to the Ge|neral Court. An Agreement ought to be inter|preted "in &s;uch a Manner as that it may have <HI>its Effect:</HI>" But if your Excellency's Interpreta|tion
<PB N="43" REF="012856_0042_0F8B9554DD9188C8">
of this Clau&s;e is ju&s;t, "that it is a Re&s;erve of Power and Authority to Parliament to bind us by &s;uch Laws as are made expre&s;ly to refer to us," it is not only "a Limitation of the Power given to the General Court" to Legi&s;late, but it may whenever the Parliament &s;hall think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it, render it of <HI>no Effect;</HI> for it puts it in the Power of Par|liament to bind us by as many Laws as they plea&s;e, and even to re&s;train us from making any Laws at all. If your Excellency's A&s;&s;ertions in this and the next &s;ucceeding Part of your Speech were well grounded, the Conclu&s;ion would be un|deniable, that the Charter even in this Clau&s;e, "does not confer or re&s;erve any Liberties" worth enjoying, "but what would have been enjoyed without it;" &s;aving that within any of his Ma|je&s;ty's Dominions we are to be con&s;idered barely as <HI>not Aliens.</HI> You are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, it cannot "be contended that by the Liberties of free and natural Subjects" (which are expre&s;ly granted in the Charter to all Intents, Purpo&s;es, and Con|&s;tructions whatever) "is to under&s;tood an Exemp|tion from Acts of Parliament becau&s;e not repre|&s;ented there; &s;eeing it is provided by the &s;ame Charter that &s;uch Acts &s;hall be in Force." If, &s;ays an eminent Lawyer, "the King grants to the Town of D. the &s;ame Liberties which London has, this &s;hall be intended the like Liberties." A Grant of the Liberties of free and natural Sub|jects is equivalent to a Grant of the &s;ame Liber|ties. And the King in the fir&s;t Charter to this Colony expre&s;sly grants that it &s;hall be con&s;trued, reputed and adjudged in all Ca&s;es mo&s;t favourably on the Behalf and for the Benefit and Behoof of the &s;aid Governor and Company and their Suc|ce&s;&s;ors&mdash;
<PB N="44" REF="012856_0043_0F8B955905C4C6B0">
any Matter, Cau&s;e or Thing what&s;oever to the contrary notwith&s;tanding." It is one of the Liberties of free and natural Subjects, born and abiding within the Realm, to be governed as your Excellency ob&s;erves, "by Laws made by Per&s;ons in who&s;e Elections they from Time to Time have a Voice." This is an e&s;&s;ential Right. For nothing is more evident, than that any Peo|ple who are &s;ubject to the unlimited Power of a|nother, mu&s;t be in a State of abject Slavery. It was ea&s;ily and plainly fore&s;een that the Right of Repre&s;entation in the Engli&s;h Parliament could not be exerci&s;ed by the People of this Colony. It would be impracticable, if con&s;i&s;tent with the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution. And for this Rea&s;on, that this Colony might have and enjoy all the Liber|ties and Immunities of free and natural Subjects within the Realm, as &s;tipulated in the Charter, it was nece&s;&s;ary, and a Legi&s;lative was accordingly con&s;tituted within the Colony; one Branch of which con&s;i&s;ts of Repre&s;entatives cho&s;en by the People, to make all Laws, Statutes, Ordinances, &amp;c. for the well ordering and governing the &s;ame, not repugnant to the Laws of England, or, as nearly as conveniently might be, agreeable to the fundamental Laws of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titu|tion. We are therefore &s;till at a Lo&s;s to conceive where your Excellency finds it "<HI>provided</HI> in the &s;ame Charter, that &s;uch Acts," <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Acts of Par|liament made expre&s;sly to refer to us, "&s;hall be in Force" in this Province. There is nothing to this Purpo&s;e expre&s;&s;ed in the Charter, or in our Opinion even implied in it. And &s;urely it would be very ab&s;urd, that a Charter, which is evidently formed upon a Suppo&s;ition and Intention, that a
<PB N="45" REF="012856_0044_0F8B9559B85FCB10">
Colony is and &s;hould be con&s;idered as not with|in the Realm; and declared by the very Prince who granted it, to be not within the Juri&s;diction of Parliament, &s;hould yet <HI>provide,</HI> that the Laws which the &s;ame Parliament &s;hould make expre&s;ly to refer to that Colony, &s;hould be in Force there|in. Your Excellency is plea&s;ed to a&s;k&punc; "Does it follow that the Government by their (our An|ce&s;tors) Removal from one Part of the Dominions to another, lo&s;es its Authority over that Part to which they remove: And that they were freed from the Subjection they were under before?" We an&s;wer, if that Part of the King's Dominions to which they removed was not then a Part of the Realm, and was never annexed to it, the Par|liament lo&s;t no Authority over it, having never had &s;uch Authority; and the Emigrants were con&s;equently freed from the Subjection they were under before their Removal: The Power and Authority of Parliament being con&s;titutionally confined within the Limits of the Realm and the Nation collectively, of which alone it is the Repre&s;enting and Legi&s;lative A&s;&s;embly. Your Excellency further a&s;ks, "Will it not rather be &s;aid, that by this their voluntary Removal, they have relinqui&s;hed for a Time at lea&s;t, one of the Rights of an Engli&s;h Subject, which they might if they plea&s;ed have continued to enjoy, and may again enjoy, whenever they return to the Place where it can be exerci&s;ed?" To which we an&s;wer; They never did relinqui&s;h the Right to be governed by Laws made by Per&s;ons in who&s;e Election they had a Voice The King &s;tipulated with them that they &s;hould have and enjoy all the Liberties of free and natural Subjects born with|in
<PB N="46" REF="012856_0045_0F8B955BF276E648">
the Realm, to all Intents, Purpo&s;es and Con|&s;tructions what&s;oever; that is, that they &s;hould be as free as tho&s;e who were to abide within the Realm: Con&s;equently he &s;tipulated with them that they &s;hould enjoy and exerci&s;e this mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential Right, which di&s;criminates Freemen from Va&s;&s;als, uninterruptedly in its full Sen&s;e and Meaning; and they did and ought &s;till to exerci&s;e it, without the Nece&s;&s;ity of returning, for the Sake of exerci&s;ing it, to the Nation or State of England.</P>
<P>We cannot help ob&s;erving, that your Excel|lency's Manner of Rea&s;oning on this Point, &s;eems to us to render the mo&s;t valuable Clau&s;es in our Charter unintelligible: As if Per&s;ons going from the Realm of England to inhabit in America, &s;hould hold and exerci&s;e there a certain Right of Engli&s;h Subjects; but in Order to exerci&s;e it in &s;uch Manner as to be of any Benefit to them, they mu&s;t <HI>not inhabit</HI> there, but return to the Place where alone it can be exerci&s;ed. By &s;uch Con&s;truction, the Words of the Charter can have no Sen&s;e or Meaning. We forbear remarking upon the Ab&s;urdity of a Grant to Per&s;ons born within the Realm, of the &s;ame Liberties which would have belonged to them if they had been born within the Realm.</P>
<P>Your Excellency is di&s;po&s;ed to compare this Government to the Variety of Corporations form|ed within the Kingdom, with Power to make and execute By-Laws, &amp;c.

Authority: This Rea&s;oning appears to us not ju&s;t. The Members of tho&s;e Corporations are Re&s;iant within the Kingdom; and Re&s;idence &s;ub|jects them to the Authority of Parliament, in which they are al&s;o repre&s;ented: Whereas the People of this Colony are not Re&s;ident within the Realm. The Charter was granted with the expre&s;s Purpo&s;e to induce them to re&s;ide with|out the Realm; con&s;equently they are not repre|&s;ented in Parliament there. But we would a&s;k your Excellency; Are any of the Corporations formed within the Kingdom, ve&s;ted with the Power of erecting other &s;ubordinate Corporations? Of enacting and determining what Crimes &s;hall be Capital? And con&s;tituting Courts of Common Law with all their Officers, for the hearing, try|ing and puni&s;hing capital Offenders with Death? The&s;e and many other Powers ve&s;ted in this Go|vernment, plainly &s;how that it is to be con&s;ider|ed as a Corporation in no other Light, than as every State is a Corporation. Be&s;ides, Appeals from the Courts of Law here, are not brought before the Hou&s;e of Lords; which &s;hows that the Peers of the Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">m are not the Peers of America: But all &s;uch Appeals are brought be|fore the King in Council, which is a further Evi|dence that we are not within the Realm.</P>
<P>We conceive enough has been &s;aid to convince your Excellency, that "when our Predece&s;&s;ors fir&s;t took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Plantation or Colony by a Grant and Charter from the Crown of England, it <HI>was not</HI> and never had been the Sen&s;e of the Kingdom, that they were to remain &s;ubject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament.

with your Excellency's Leave, enquire what <HI>was</HI> the Sen&s;e of our Ance&s;tors of this very important Matter.</P>
<P>And as your Excellency has been plea&s;ed to tell us, you have not di&s;covered that the Supreme Authority of Parliament has been called in Que&s;|tion even by private and particular Per&s;ons, un|til within &s;even or eight Years pa&s;t; except a|bout the Time of the Anarchy and Confu&s;ion in England, which preceeded the Re&s;toration of King Charles the Second; we beg leave to remind your Excellency of &s;ome Parts of your own Hi&s;|tory of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay. Therein we are in|formed of the Sentiments of "Per&s;ons of Influ|ence" after the Re&s;toration, from which the Hi&s;|torian tells us, &s;ome Parts of their Conduct, that is of the General A&s;&s;embly, "may be pretty well accounted for." By the Hi&s;tory it appears to have been the Opinion of tho&s;e Per&s;ons of Influ|ence, "that the Subjects of any Prince or State had a natural Right to remove to any other State or to another Quarter of the World, unle&s;s the State was weakened or expo&s;ed by &s;uch Remove; and even in that Ca&s;e, if they were deprived of the Right of all Mankind, Liberty of Con&s;cience, it would ju&s;tify a Separation, and <HI>upon their Re|moval their Subjection determined and cea&s;ed.</HI>" That "the Country to which they had removed, was claimed and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by independent Princes, who&s;e Right to the Lord&s;hip and Sovereignty thereof had been acknowledged by the Kings of England," an In&s;tance of which is quoted in the Margin; "That the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> them&s;elves had actu|ally purcha&s;ed for valuable Con&s;ideration, not

only the Soil, but the Dominion, the Lord&s;hip and Sovereignty of tho&s;e Princes;" without which Purcha&s;e, "in the Sight of God and Men, they had no Right or Title to what they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. That they had received a Charter of Incorpora|tion from the King, from whence aro&s;e a new Kind of Subjection, namely, "a voluntary, civil Subjection;" and by this Compact "they were <HI>to be governed by Laws made by them&s;elves.</HI>" Thus it appears to have been the Sentiments of <HI>private</HI> Per&s;ons, though Per&s;ons by who&s;e Senti|ments the public Conduct was influenced, that their Removal was a ju&s;tifiable Separation from the Mother State, upon which their Subjection to that State determined and cea&s;ed. The Su|preme Authority of Parliament, if it had then ever been a&s;&s;erted, mu&s;t &s;urely have been called in Que&s;tion, by Men who had advanced &s;uch Principles as the&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Act of Parliament made expre&s;ly to refer to the Colonies, was after the Re&s;toration. In the Reign of King Charles the Second, &s;eve|ral &s;uch Acts pa&s;&s;ed. And the &s;ame Hi&s;tory in|forms us there was a Difficulty in conforming to them; and the Rea&s;on of this Difficulty is ex|plained in a Letter of the General A&s;&s;embly to their Agent, quoted in the following Words, "They apprehended them to be an Inva&s;ion of the Rights Liberties and Properties of the Subjects of his Maje&s;ty in the Colony, <HI>they not being re|pre&s;ented in Parliament,</HI> and according to the u&s;ual Sayings of the Learned in the Law, the Laws of England were bounded within the four Seas, <HI>and did not reach America:</HI> However as
<PB N="50" REF="012856_0049_0F8B955E77B27BE0">
his Maje&s;ty had &s;ignified his Plea&s;ure that tho&s;e Acts &s;hould be ob&s;erved in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, they had made Provi&s;ion by a Law of the Colony that they &s;hould be &s;trictly attended." Which Pro|vi&s;ion by a Law of their own would have been &s;uperfluous, if they had admitted the Supreme Authority of Parliament. In &s;hort, by the &s;ame Hi&s;tory it appears that tho&s;e Acts of Parliament as &s;uch were di&s;regarded; and the following Rea&s;on is given for it; "It &s;eems to have been a <HI>general</HI> Opinion that Acts of Parliament had no other Force, than what they derived from Acts made by the General Court to e&s;tabli&s;h and con|firm them."</P>
<P>But &s;till further to &s;how the Sen&s;e of our An|ce&s;tors re&s;pecting this Matter, we beg leave to recite &s;ome Parts of a Narrative pre&s;ented to the Lords of Privy Council by Edward Randolph, in the Year 1676, which we find in your Excel|lency's Collection of Papers lately publi&s;hed. Therein it is declared to be the Sen&s;e of the Co|lony, "that no Law is in Force or E&s;teem there, but &s;uch as are made by the General Court; and therefore it is accounted a Breach of their Privi|leges, and a Betraying of the Liberties of their Common-wealth, to urge the Ob&s;ervation of the Laws of England." And further, "That no Oath &s;hall be urged or required to be taken by any Per&s;on, but &s;uch Oath as the General Court hath con&s;idered, allowed and required." And further, "there is no notice taken of the Act of Navigation, Plantation or any other Laws made in England for the Regulation of Trade." "That the Government would make the World believe
<PB N="51" REF="012856_0050_0F8B9564DC5A4D00">
they are a free State, and do act in all Matters ac|cordingly." Again, "The&s;e Magi&s;trates ever re&s;erve to them&s;elves a Power to alter, evade and di&s;annul any Law or Command, not agreeing with their Humour o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the ab&s;olute Authority of their Government, acknowledging no Superior." And further, "He the (Governor) freely declared to me, that the Laws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">de by your Maje&s;ty and your Parliament, obligeth them in nothing, but what con&s;i&s;ts with the Intere&s;ts of that Colony, that the Legi&s;lative Power and Authority is and abides in them <HI>&s;olely.</HI>" And in the &s;ame Mr. Randolph's Letter to the Bi&s;hop of London, Ju|ly 14, 1682, he &s;ays, "This <HI>Independency</HI> in Government, claimed and daily practi&s;ed." And your Excellency being <HI>then</HI> &s;en&s;ible that this was the Sen&s;e of our Ance&s;tors, in a Marginal Note in the &s;ame Collection of Papers, ob&s;erves, that "this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the Provi&s;ion made for ob&s;erving the Acts of Trade, "is very extraordinary, for this Provi&s;ion was an Act of the Colony declaring the Acts of Trade &s;hall be in Force there." Although Mr. Randolph was very unfriendly to the Colony, yet as his Declarations are concur|rent with tho&s;e recited from your Excellency's Hi&s;tory, we think they may be admitted for the Purpo&s;e for which they are now brought.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, from your Excellency's Hi&s;tory and Publications, the Sen&s;e our Ance&s;tors had of the Juri&s;diction of Parliament under the fir&s;t Char|ter. Very different from that which your Ex|cellency <HI>in your Speech</HI> apprehends it to have been.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="012856_0051_0F8B9565974A8A28">
It appears by Mr. Neal's Hi&s;tory of New-England, that the Agents who had been employed by the Colony to tran&s;acts it Affairs in England at the Time when the pre&s;ent Charter was gran|ted, among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ther Rea&s;ons gave the following for their Acceptance of it, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "The General Court has with the King's Approbation as much Power in New-England, as the King and Parliament have in England; they have all Engli&s;h Privile|ges, and can be touched by <HI>no Law,</HI> and by no Tax but of their own making." This is the earlie&s;t Te&s;timony that can be given of the Sen&s;e our Predece&s;&s;ors had of the Supreme Authority of Parliament under the pre&s;ent Charter. And it plainly &s;hows, that they, who having been free|ly conver&s;ant with tho&s;e who framed the Charter, mu&s;t have well under&s;tood the De&s;ign and Mean|ing of it, &s;uppo&s;ed that the Terms in our Charter "full Power and Authority," intended and were con&s;idered as a <HI>&s;ole</HI> and exclu&s;ive Power, and that there was no "Re&s;erve in the Charter to the Authority of Parliament, to bind the Colony" by any Acts whatever.</P>
<P>Soon after the Arrival of the Charter, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in 1692, your Excellency's Hi&s;tory informs us, "the fir&s;t Act" of this Legi&s;lative was a Sort of Magna Charta, a&s;&s;erting and &s;etting forth their general Privileges, and this Clau&s;e was among the re&s;t, "No Aid, Tax, Tallage, A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, Cu&s;tom, Loan, Benevolence or Impo&s;ition what|ever, &s;hall be laid, a&s;&s;e&s;s'd, impos'd or levied on any of their Maje&s;ty's Subjects, or their E&s;tates, on any Pretence whatever, but by the Act and Con&s;ent of the Governor, Council and Repre&s;en|tatives
<PB N="53" REF="012856_0052_0F8B9565F9E44060">
of the People a&s;&s;embled in General Court." And though this Act was di&s;allowed, it &s;erves to &s;how the Sen&s;e which the General A&s;&s;embly con|temporary with the granting the Charter had of their &s;ole and exclu&s;ive Right to Legi&s;late for the Colony. The Hi&s;tory &s;ays, "the other Parts of the Act were copied from Magna Char|ta;" by which we may conclude that the A&s;&s;em|bly then con&s;trued the Words "not repugnant to the Laws," to mean, conformable to the fun|damental Principles of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution. And it is ob&s;ervable that the Lords of Privy Council, &s;o lately as in the Reign of Queen Anne, when &s;everal Laws enacted by the General A&s;|&s;embly, were laid before her Maje&s;ty for her Al|lowance, interpreted the Words in this Charter, "not repugnant to the Laws of England," by the Words "as nearly as conveniently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be agreeable to the Laws and Statutes of England." And her Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to di&s;allow tho&s;e Acts, not becau&s;e they were repugnant to any Law or Statute of England, made expre&s;ly to re|fer to the Colony; but becau&s;e divers Per&s;ons, by Virtue thereof, were puni&s;hed without being tried by their Peers in the ordinary "Courts of Law," and "by the ordinary Rules and known Methods of Ju&s;tice;" contrary to the expre&s;s Terms of Magna Charta, which was a Statute in Force at the Time of granting the Charter, and declaratory of the Rights and Li|berties of the Subjects within the Realm.</P>
<P>You are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that "our Provincial or Local Laws have in numerous In&s;tances had Relation to Acts of Parliament made to re&s;pect
<PB N="54" REF="012856_0053_0F8B9566C1FA35D8">
the Plantations and this Colony in particular." The Authority of the Legi&s;lature, &s;ays the &s;ame Author who is quoted by your Excellency, "does not extend &s;o far as the Fundamentals of the Con&s;titution." "They ought to con&s;ider the Fundamental Laws as &s;acred, if the Nation has not in very expre&s;s Terms, given them the Power to change them. For the Con&s;titution of the State ought to be fixed: And &s;ince that was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Nation, which afterwards tru&s;t|ed certain Per&s;ons with the Legi&s;lative Power, the fundamental Laws are excepted from their Commi&s;&s;ion." Now the Fundamentals of the Con&s;titution of this Province are &s;tipulated in the Charter; the Rea&s;oning therefore in this Ca&s;e holds equally good. Much le&s;s then ought any Acts or Doings of the General A&s;&s;embly, how|ever numerous, to neither of which your Excel|lency has pointed us, which barely relate to Acts of Parliament made to re&s;pect the Plantations in general, or this Colony in particular, to be taken as an Acknowledgment of this People, or even of the A&s;&s;embly, which inadvertently pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e Acts, that we are &s;ubject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament. And with &s;till le&s;s Rea&s;on are the Deci&s;ions in the Executive Courts to deter|mine this Point. If they have adopted that "as Part of the Rule of Law," which in Fact is not, it mu&s;t be imputed to Inattention or Error in Judgment, and cannot ju&s;tly be urged as an Alte|ration or Re&s;triction of the Legi&s;lative Authority of the Province.</P>
<P>Before we leave this Part of your Excellency's Speech, we would ob&s;erve, that the great De&s;ign
<PB N="55" REF="012856_0054_0F8B95679EA780F0">
of our Ance&s;tors, in leaving the Kingdom of England, was to be freed from a Subjection to its &s;piritual Laws and Courts, and to wor&s;hip God according to the Dictates of their Con&s;ciences. Your Excellency in your Hi&s;tory ob&s;erves, that their De&s;ign was "to obtain for them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity the Liberty of wor&s;hipping God in &s;uch Manner as appeared to them mo&s;t agreeable to the &s;acred Scriptures." And the General Court them&s;elves declared in 1651, that "&s;eeing ju&s;t Cau&s;e to fear the Per&s;ecution of the then Bi&s;hop, and High Commi&s;&s;ion for not conforming to the Ceremonies of tho&s;e under their Power, they thought it their &s;afe&s;t Cour&s;e, to get to this Out&s;ide of the World, out of their View and <HI>beyond their Reach.</HI>" But if it had been their Sen&s;e, that they were &s;till to be &s;ubject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament, they mu&s;t have known that their De&s;ign might and probably would be fru&s;trated; that the Parliament, e&s;pe|cially con&s;idering the Temper of tho&s;e Times, might make what eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws they plea&s;|ed, expre&s;sly to refer to them, and place them in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances with Re&s;pect to religi|ous Matters, to be relieved from which was the De&s;ign of their Removal. And we would add&punc; that if your Excellency's Con&s;truction of the Clau&s;e in our pre&s;ent Charter is ju&s;t, another Clau&s;e therein, which provides for Liberty of Con&s;cience for all Chri&s;tians except Papi&s;ts, may be rendered void by an Act of Parliament made to refer to us, requiring a Conformity to the Rites and Mode of Wor&s;hip in the Church of England, or any other.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="012856_0055_0F8B956BF9D43EB8">
Thus we have endeavoured to &s;hew the Sen&s;e of the People of this Colony under both Char|ters; and if there have been in any late In&s;tances a Submi&s;&s;ion to Acts of Parliament, it has been in our Opinion, rather from Incon&s;ideration or a Reluctance at the Idea of contending with the Parent State, than from a Conviction or Acknow|ledgement of the Supreme Legi&s;lative Authority of Parliament.</P>
<P>Your Excllency tells us, "you know of no Line that can be drawn between the Supreme Au|thority of Parliament and the total Independence of the Colonies." If there be no &s;uch Line, the Con&s;equence is, either that the Colonies are the Va&s;&s;als of the Parliament, or, that they are to|tally Independent. As it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the Intention of the Parties in the Compact, that we &s;hould be reduced to a State of Va&s;&s;allage, the Conclu&s;ion is, that it was their Sen&s;e, that we were thus Independent. "It is Im|po&s;&s;ible, your Excellency &s;ays, that there &s;hould be two independent Legi&s;latures in one and the &s;ame State." May we not then further conclude, that it was their Sen&s;e that the Colonies were by their Charters made di&s;tinct States from the Mo|ther Country? Your Excellency adds, For although there may be but one Head, the King, yet the two Legi&s;lative Bodies will make two Governments as di&s;tinct as the Kingdoms of England and Scotland before the Union. Very true, may it plea&s;e your Excellency; and if they interfere not with each other, what hinders but that being united in one Head and common So|vereign, they may live happily in that Connection,
<PB N="57" REF="012856_0056_0F8B956CC6169BE8">
and mutually &s;upport and protect each other? Notwith&s;tanding all the Terrors which your Ex|cellency has pictured to us as the Affects of a to|tal Independence, there is more Rea&s;on to dread the Con&s;equences of ab&s;olute uncontrouled Su|preme Power, whether of a Nation or a Monarch, than tho&s;e of a total Independence. It would be a Misfortune "to know by Experience, the Dif|ference between the Liberties of an Engli&s;h Co|loni&s;t and tho&s;e of the Spani&s;h, French and Dutch: And &s;ince the Briti&s;h Parliament has pa&s;&s;ed an Act which is executed even with Rigour, though not voluntarily &s;ubmitted to, for rai&s;ing a Reve|nue, and appropriating the &s;ame without the Con|&s;ent of the People who pay it, and have claimed a Power making &s;uch Laws as they plea&s;e to or|der and govern us, your Excellency will excu&s;e us in a&s;king, whether you do not think we alrea|dy experience too much of &s;uch a Difference, and have not Rea&s;on to fear we &s;hall &s;oon be re|duced to a wor&s;e Situation than that of the Colo|nies of France, Spain or Holland?</P>
<P>If your Excellency expects to have the Line of Di&s;tinction between the Supreme Authority of Parliament, and the total Independence of the Colonies drawn by us, we would &s;ay it would be an arduous Undertaking; and of very great Im|portance to all the other Colonies: And there|fore, could we conceive of &s;uch a Line, we &s;hould be unwilling to propo&s;e it, without their Con&s;ent in Congre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="012856_0057_0F8B956D79BBC900">
To conclude, The&s;e are great and profound Que&s;tions. It is the Grief of this Hou&s;e, that by the ill Policy of a late injudicious Admini&s;tra|tion, America has been driven into the Contem|plation of them. And we cannot but expre&s;s our Concern, that your Excellency by your Speech has reduced us to the unhappy Alterna|tive, either of appearing by our Silence to ac|quie&s;ce in your Excellency's Sentiments, or of thus freely di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this Point.</P>
<P>After all that we have &s;aid, we would be far from being under&s;tood to have in the lea&s;t abated that ju&s;t Sen&s;e of Allegiance which we owe to the King of Great-Britain, our rightful Sove|reign: And &s;hould the People of this Province be left to the free and full Exerci&s;e of all the Liberties and Immunities granted to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> by Charter, there would be no Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ger of an Inde|pendance on the Crown. Our Charters re&s;erve great Power to the Crown in its Repre&s;entative, fully &s;ufficient to balance, analagous to the Eng|li&s;h Con&s;titution, all the Liberties and Privileges granted to the People. All this your Excellen|cy knows full well&mdash;And whoever con&s;iders the Power and Influence, in all their Branches, re|&s;erved by our Charter to the Crown, will be far from thinking that the Commons of this Province are too Independent.</P>

<P>THE Proceedings of &s;uch of the Inhabitants of the Town of Bo&s;ton as a&s;&s;embled together and pa&s;&s;ed and publi&s;hed their Re&s;olves or Votes as the Act of the Town at a legal Town-Meeting, denying in the mo&s;t expre&s;s Terms the Supremacy of Parliament, and invit|ing every other Town and Di&s;trict in the Province to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">opt the &s;ame Principle and to e&s;tabli&s;h Com|mittees of Corre&s;pondence to con&s;ult upon pro|per Mea&s;ures to maintain it, and the Proceedings of divers other Towns, in Con&s;equence of this Invitation, appeared to me to be &s;o unwarranta|ble and of &s;uch a dangerous Nature and Ten|dency, that I thought my&s;elf bound to call upon you in my Speech at Opening the Se&s;&s;ion, to join with me in di&s;countenancing and bearing a pro|per Te&s;timony again&s;t &s;uch Irregularities and Innovations.</P>

your Rea&s;ons in &s;upport of your Opinions, &s;o far as you might differ from me. I hoped that you would have con&s;idered my Speech by your joint Committees, and have given me a joint An|&s;wer; but, as the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives have declined that Mode of Proceeding, and as your Principles in Government are very different, I am obliged to make &s;eparate and di&s;tinct replies.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t apply my&s;elf to you,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Council,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The two fir&s;t Parts of your An&s;wer, which Re&s;pect the Di&s;orders occa&s;ioned by the Stamp-Act and the general Nature of Supreme Autho|rity, do not appear to me to have a Tendency to invalidate any Thing which I have &s;aid in my Speech; for, however the Stamp-Act may have been the immediate Occa&s;ion of any Di&s;orders, the Authority of Parliament was notwith&s;tanding denied in Order to ju&s;tify or excu&s;e them. And, for the Nature of the Supreme Authority of Parliament, I have never given you any Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that I intended a more ab&s;olute Pow|er in Parliament, or a greater Degree of active or pa&s;&s;ive Obedience in the People, than what is founded in the Nature of Government, let the Form of it be what it may. I &s;hall, therefore, pa&s;s over tho&s;e Parts of your An&s;wer without any other Remark. I would al&s;o have &s;aved you the Trouble of all tho&s;e Authorities which you have brought to &s;hew, that all Taxes upon Engli&s;h Subjects mu&s;t be levied by Virtue of the Act not of the King alone but in Conjunction
<PB N="61" REF="012856_0060_0F8B9573EEE34BC0">
with the Lords and Commons, for I &s;hould very readily have allowed it; and I &s;hould as readily have allowed that all other Acts of Legi&s;lation mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame joint Authority, and not by the King alone.</P>
<P>Indeed, I am not willing to continue a Con|trover&s;y with you upon any other Parts of your An&s;wer. I am glad to find that Independence is what you have not in Contemplation; and that you will not pre&s;ume to pre&s;cribe the exact Limits of the Authority of Parliament; only, as with due Deference to it, you are humbly of Opinion, that, as all human Authority in the Nature of it is and ought to be limited, it cannot con&s;titutionally extend for the Rea&s;ons you have &s;ugge&s;ted, to the levying of Taxes in any Form on his Maje&s;ty's Subjects of this Province.</P>
<P>I will only oberve, that your Attempts to draw a Line as the Limits of the Supreme Authority in Government, by di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;ome natural Rights as more peculiarly exempt from &s;uch Au|thority than the re&s;t, rather tend to evince the Impracticability of drawing &s;uch a Line; and that &s;ome Parts of your An&s;wer &s;eem to infer a Supremacy in the Province at the &s;ame Time that you acknowledge the Supremacy of Parlia|ment, for otherwi&s;e the Rights of the Subjects cannot be the &s;ame in all e&s;&s;ential Re&s;pects&punc; as you &s;uppo&s;e them to be, in all Parts of the Do|minions, "under a like Form of Legi&s;lature."</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;hall take no Notice of that Part of your An&s;wer which attributes the Di&s;orders of the Province to an undue Exerci&s;e of the Power of Parliament, becau&s;e you take for granted, what can by no Means be admitted, that Parliament had exerci&s;ed its Power without ju&s;t Authority. The Sum of your An&s;wer &s;o far as it is pertinent to my Speech, is this.</P>
<P>You alledge that the Colonies were an Acqui|&s;ition of Foreign Territory not annexed to the Realm of England, and therefore at the <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> Di&s;po&s;al of the Crown; the King having, as you

When any new Countries are di&s;co|vered

by Engli&s;h Subjects, according to the gene|ral Law and U&s;age of Nations, they become Part of the State, and, according to the Feudal Sy&s;tem, the Lord&s;hip or Dominion is in the Crown and a Right accrues of di&s;po&s;ing of &s;uch Territories, under &s;uch Tenure or for &s;uch Services to be performed as the Crown &s;hall judge proper, and when&s;oever any Part of &s;uch Territories, by Grant from the Crown, becomes the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or Property of private Per&s;ons, &s;uch Per&s;ons, thus holding under the Crown of England, remain or become Subjects of England to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, as fully as if any of the Royal Manors Fore&s;ts or other Territory within the Realm had been granted to them upon the like Tenure. But that it is now, or was when the Plantations were fir&s;t granted, the Prerogative of the Kings of England to alienate &s;uch Territories from the Crown, or to con&s;titute a Number of new Go|vernments altogether independant of the Sove|reign Legi&s;lative Authority of the Engli&s;h Em|pire. I can by no Means concede to you. I have never &s;een any better Authority to &s;upport &s;uch an Opinion than an anonimous Pamphlet by which I fear you have too ea&s;ily been mi&s;lead, for I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew you that the Declarations of King James the Fir&s;t, and of King Charles the Fir&s;t, admitting they are truly related by the Author of this Pamphlet, ought to have no Weight with you; nor does the Ce&s;&s;ion or Re&s;toration, upon a Trea|ty of Peace, of Countries which have been lo&s;t or acquired in War militate with the&s;e Principles, nor may any particular Act of Power of a Prince in &s;elling or delivering up any Part of His Do|minions to a foreign Prince or State again&s;t the
<PB N="65" REF="012856_0064_0F8B9577FB2A2DE0">
general Sen&s;e of the Nation be urged to invali|date them, and upon Examination it will appear that all the Grants which have been made of America are founded upon them and are made to conform to them, even tho&s;e which you have adduced in Support of very different Principles.</P>
<P>You do not recollect that, prior to what you call the fir&s;t Grant by Q. Elizabeth to Sir Walter Raleigh, a Grant had been made, by the &s;ame Prince&s;s, to Sir Humphrey Gilbert of all &s;uch Countries as he &s;hould di&s;cover which were to be <HI>of the Allegiance of her, her Heirs and Suc|ce&s;&s;ors</HI> but, he dying in the Pro&s;ecution of his Voyage, a &s;econd Grant was made to Sir Walter Raleigh which, you &s;ay, conveyed the Dominion and Sovereignty without any Re&s;erve of Legi&s;la|tive or Executive Authority <HI>being held by Homage and a Render.</HI> To hold by <HI>Homage,</HI> which im|plies Fealty, <HI>and a Render</HI> is De&s;criptive of So|cage Tenure as fully as if it had been &s;aid to hold <HI>as of our Manor of Ea&s;t Greenwich</HI> the Words in your Charter. Now this alone was a Re&s;erve of Dominion and Sovereignty in the Queen her Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors and, be&s;ides this, the Grant is made upon this expre&s;s Condition, which you pa&s;s over, <HI>that the People remain &s;ub|ject to the Crown of England,</HI> the Head of that Legi&s;lative Authority which, by the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, is equally exten&s;ive with the Autho|rity of the Crown throughout every Part of the Dominions. Now if we could &s;uppo&s;e the Queen to have acquired &s;eparate from her Relations to her Subjects, or in her natural Capacity, which &s;he could not do, a Title to a Country di&s;cover|ed
<PB N="66" REF="012856_0065_0F8B9578C479CC38">
by her Subjects and then to grant the &s;ame Country to Engli&s;h Subjects in her publick Ca|pacity as Queen of England, &s;till by this Grant &s;he annexed it to the Crown. Thus by not di&s;|tingui&s;hing between the Crown of England and the Kings and Queens of England in their per&s;o|nal or natural Capacities, you have been led in|to a fundamental Error which mu&s;t prove fatal to your Sy&s;tem. It is not material whether Vir|ginia reverted to the Crown by Sir Walter's At|tainder or whether he never took any Benefit from his Grant, though the latter is mo&s;t proba|ble &s;eeing he cea&s;ed from all Attempts to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Country after a few Years Trial. There were, undoubtedly, divers Grants made by King James the Fir&s;t of the Continent of A|merica in the Beginning of the 17th Century and &s;imilar to the Grant of Queen Elizabeth in this Re&s;pect, that they were dependant on the Crown. The Charter to the Council at Plimouth in De|von dated November 3d, 1620 more immedi|ately re&s;pects us, and of that we have the mo&s;t authentick Remains.</P>
<P>By this Charter, upon the Petition of Sir Fer|dinando Gorges a Corporation was con&s;tituted to be and continue by Succe&s;&s;ion forever in the Town of Plimouth afore&s;aid, to which Corpora|tion that Part of the American Continent which lies between the 40&deg; and 48&deg; Degrees of Lati|tude was granted <HI>to be held of the King his Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors as of the Manor of Ea&s;t Green|wich</HI> with Powers to con&s;titute &s;ubordinate Go|vernments in America and to make Laws for &s;uch Governments, <HI>not repugnant to the Laws
<PB N="67" REF="012856_0066_0F8B957977973768">
and Statutes of England.</HI> From this Corpora|tion your Predece&s;&s;ors obtained a Grant of the Soil of the Colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay, in 1627, and, in 1628, they obtained a Charter from King Charles the Fir&s;t making them a di&s;tinct Corporation, al&s;o within the Realm, and giving them full Powers within the Limits of their Pa|tent; very like to tho&s;e of the Council of Pli|mouth throughout their more exten&s;ive Territory.</P>
<P>We will now con&s;ider what mu&s;t have been the Sen&s;e of the King of the Nation and of the Patentees at the Time of granting the&s;e Patents. From the Year 1602 the Banks and Sea Coa&s;ts of New-England had been frequented by Eng|li&s;h Subjects for catching and drying Cod-Fi&s;h. When an exclu&s;ive Right to the Fi&s;hery was claimed, by Virtue of the Patent of 1620, the Hou&s;e of Commons was alarmed and a Bill was brought in for allowing a free Fi&s;hery, and it was upon this Occa&s;ion that one of the Secreta|ries of State declared perhaps as his own Opinion, that the Plantations were not annexed to the Crown and &s;o were not within the Juri&s;diction of Parliament. Sir Edwin Sandys, who was one of the Virginia Company and an eminent Lawyer, declared that he knew Virginia had been annexed and <HI>was held of the Crown as of the Manor of Ea&s;t Greenwich</HI> and he believed New-England was &s;o al&s;o; and &s;o it mo&s;t certainly was. This Declaration, made by one of the King's Servants, you &s;ay &s;hewed the Sen&s;e of the Crown and, being not &s;ecretly but openly declared in Parlia|ment you would make it the Sen&s;e of the Na|tion al&s;o, notwith&s;tanding your own A&s;&s;ertion
<PB N="68" REF="012856_0067_0F8B957A8B0BD9B0">
that the Lords and Commons pa&s;&s;ed a Bill that &s;hewed their Sen&s;e to be directly the contrary. But if there had been full Evidence of expre&s;s Declarations made by King James the Fir&s;t, and King Charles the Fir&s;t, they were Declarations contrary to their own Grants, which declare this Country to be held of the Crown and con&s;e|quently it mu&s;t have been annexed to it. And may not &s;uch Declarations be accounted for by other Actions of tho&s;e Princes who when they were &s;olliciting the Parliament to grant the Du|ties of Tonnage and Poundage with other Aids and were, in this Way, acknowledging the Rights of Parliament, at the &s;ame Time were requiring the Payment of tho&s;e Duties with Ship Money, &amp;c. by Virtue of their Prerogative?</P>
<P>But to remove all doubt of the Sen&s;e of the Nation and of the Patentees of this Patent or Charter in 1620 I need only refer you to the Account publi&s;hed by Sir Ferdinando Gorges him&s;elf of the Proceedings in Parliament upon this Occa&s;ion. As he was the mo&s;t active Mem|ber of the Council of Plimouth and as he re|lates what came within his own Knowledge and Ob&s;ervation his Narrative, which has all the Appearance of Truth and Sincerity, mu&s;t carry Conviction with it. He &s;ays that &s;oon after the Patent was pa&s;&s;ed and whil&s;t it lay in the Crown-Office he was &s;ummoned to appear in Parliament to an&s;wer what was to be objected again&s;t it, and the Hou&s;e being in a Committee and Sir Edward Coke that great Oracle of the Law, in the Chair, he was called to the Bar and was told by Sir Edward that the Hou&s;e under&s;tood that a Patent
<PB N="69" REF="012856_0068_0F8B957F21F09558">
had been granted to the &s;aid Sir <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erdinando and divers other noble Per&s;ons for e&s;tabli&s;hing a Colony in New-England, that this was d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">med a Grievance of the Common-wealth <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the Laws,</HI> and to the Privileges of the Subject, that it was a Monopoly, &amp;c. and he required the Delivery of the Patent into the Hou&s;e. Sir Ferdinando Gorges made no Doubt of the Au|thority of the Hou&s;e but &s;ubmitted to their Di&s;|po&s;al of the Patent as in their Wi&s;dom they thought good "not knowing, under Favour, how any Action of that King could be a Grievance to the Publick &s;eeing it was undertaken for the Advancement of Religion, <HI>the Enlargement of the Bounds of our Nation.</HI> &amp;c. He was willing, however, to &s;ubmit the whole to their honorable Cen&s;ures." After divers Attendances he imagin|ed he had &s;atisfied the Hou&s;e that the planting a Colony was of much more Con&s;equence than a &s;imple di&s;orderly Cour&s;e of Fi&s;hing. He was, notwith&s;tanding, di&s;appointed and, when the Pub|lick Grievances of the Kingdom were pre&s;ented by the two Hou&s;es, that of the Patent for New-England was the fir&s;t. I don't know how the Parliament could have &s;hewn more fully the Sen&s;e they then had of their Authority over this new acquired Territory, nor can we expect bet|ter Evidence of the Sen&s;e which the Patentees had of it, for I know of no hi&s;torical Fact of which we have le&s;s Rea&s;on to doubt.</P>
<P>And now Gentlemen I will &s;hew you how it appears from our Charter it&s;elf, which you &s;ay I have not yet been plea&s;ed to point out to you except from that Clau&s;e which re&s;trains us from
<PB N="70" REF="012856_0069_0F8B9581541645E0">
making Laws repugnant to the Laws of England, that it was the Sen&s;e of our Predece&s;&s;ors at the Time when the Charter was granted that they were to remain &s;ubject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this Clau&s;e, which I &s;hall have Occa|&s;ion further to remark upon before I fini&s;h, you will find that, by the Charter a Grant was made of Exemption from all Taxes and Impo&s;itions upon any Goods imported <HI>into New-England,</HI> or exported from thence into England for the Space of twenty-one Years, except the Cu&s;tom of five per Cent upon &s;uch Goods as, after the Expiration of &s;even Years, &s;hould be brought into England. Nothing can be more plain than that the Charter, as well as the Patent to the Council of Plimouth, con&s;titutes a Corporation in England with Powers to create a &s;ubordinate Government or Governments within the Plantation, &s;o that there would always be Subjects of Taxes and Impo&s;itions both in the Kingdom and in the Plan|tation. An Exemption for twenty-one Years im|plies a Right of Impo&s;ition after the Expiration of the Term, and there is no Di&s;tinction between the Kingdom and the Plantation. By what Au|thority, then, in the Under&s;tanding of the Parties, were the&s;e Impo&s;itions to be laid? If any, to &s;upport a Sy&s;tem, &s;hould &s;ay by the King rather than to acknowledge the Authority of Parliament, yet this could not be the Sen&s;e of one of our principal Patentees Mr. Samuel Va&s;&s;all who at that In&s;tant, 1628, the Date of the Charter, was &s;uffering the Lo&s;s of his Goods rather than &s;ubmit to an Impo&s;ition laid by the King without
<PB N="71" REF="012856_0070_0F8B958259570B98">
the Authority of Parliament; and to prove that a few Years after it could not be the Sen&s;e of the re&s;t I need only to refer you to your own Records for the Year 1642 where you will find an Order of the Hou&s;e of Commons, conceived in &s;uch Terms as di&s;cover a plain Reference to this Part of the Charter, after fourteen Years of the Twenty-one were expired. By this Order the Hou&s;e of Commons declare that all Goods and Merchandize exported to New-England or imported from thence &s;hall be free from all Tax|es and Impo&s;itions both in the Kingdom <HI>and in New-England</HI> until the Hou&s;e &s;hall take further Order therein to the contrary. The Sen&s;e which our Predece&s;&s;ors had of the Benefit which they took from this Order evidently appears from the Vote of the General Court, acknowledging their humble Thankfulne&s;s, and pre&s;erving a grateful Remembrance of the Honorable Re&s;pect from that high Court, and re&s;olving that the Order &s;ent unto them under the Hand of the Clerk of the Honorable Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hall be entered among their Publick Records to remain there unto Po&s;terity: And, in an Addre&s;s to Parliament, Nine Years after, they acknowledge, among other unde&s;erved Favours that of <HI>taking off the Cu&s;toms from them.</HI></P>
<P>I am at a Lo&s;s to know what your Ideas could be when you &s;ay that if the Plantations are not Part of the <HI>Realm,</HI> they are not Part of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> &s;eeing the two Words can properly convey but one Idea and they have one and the &s;ame Signification in the different Languages from whence they are derived. I do not charge you
<PB N="72" REF="012856_0071_0F8B9582882E3530">
with any De&s;ign, but the equivocal U&s;e of the Word Realm in &s;everal Parts of your An&s;wer makes them perplexed and ob&s;cure. Sometimes, you mu&s;t intend the whole Dominion which is &s;ubject to the Authority of Parliament, &s;ometimes only &s;trictly the Territorial Realm to which other Dominions are or may be annexed. If you mean that no Countries but the ancient territorial Realm can con&s;titutionally be &s;ubject to the Su|preme Authority of England, which you have very incautiou&s;ly &s;aid is a Rule of the Common Law of England, this is a Doctrine which you will never be able to &s;upport. That the Com|mon Law &s;hould be controuled and changed by Statutes every Day's Experience teaches, but that the Common Law pre&s;cribes Limits to the Extent of the Legi&s;lative Power, I believe has never been &s;aid upon any other Occa&s;ion. That Acts of Parliament for &s;everal Hundred Years pa&s;t have re&s;pected Countries, which are not &s;trictly within the Realm, you might ea&s;ily have di&s;covered by the Statute Books. You will find Acts for regulating the Affairs of Ireland, though a &s;eperate and di&s;tinct Kingdom. Wales and Calais, whil&s;t they &s;ent no Repre&s;entatives to Parliament, were &s;ubject to the like Regulations. So are Guern&s;ey, Jer&s;ey, Alderney, &amp;c. which &s;end no Members to this Day. The&s;e Countries are not more properly a Part of the ancient Realm, than the Plantations, nor do I know that they can more properly be &s;aid to be annexed to the Realm, unle&s;s the declaring that Acts of Parliament &s;hall extend to Wales, though not particularly named &s;hall make it &s;o, which I conceive it does not in the Sen&s;e you intend.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="012856_0072_0F8B958337DC81B0">
Thus, I think, I have made it appear that the Plantations, though not &s;trictly within the Realm, have from the Beginning been con&s;titutionally &s;ubject to the Supreme Authority of the Realm and are &s;o far annexed to it as to be, with the Realm and the other Dependencies upon it, one intire Dominion; and that the Plantation or Co|lony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay in particular is holden as feudatory of the Imperial Crown of England: Deem it to be no Part of the Realm it is imma|terial, for, to u&s;e the Words of a very great Authority in a Ca&s;e in &s;ome Re&s;pects analogous, "being Feudatory the Conclu&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary fol|lows, that it is under the Government of the King's Laws and the King's Courts in Ca&s;es pro|per for them to interpo&s;e, though (like Counties Palatine) it has peculiar Laws and Cu&s;toms, Jura Regalia, and complete Juri&s;diction at Home."</P>
<P>Your Remark upon and Con&s;truction of the Words, <HI>not Repugnant to the Laws of England,</HI> are much the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the Council; but can any Rea&s;on be a&s;&s;igned why the Laws of England as they &s;tood ju&s;t at that Period &s;hould be pitched upon as the Standard, more than at any other Period? If &s;o, why was it not recur|ed to when the &s;econd Charter was Granted, more than &s;ixty Years after the fir&s;t? It is not improbable that the original Intention might be a Repugnancy in general and, a Fortiori, &s;uch Laws as were made more immediately to Re&s;pect us, but the Statute of 7th and 8th, of King Wil|liam and Queen Mary, &s;oon after the &s;econd Charter, favours the latter Con&s;truction only, and the Province Agent, Mr. Dummer, in his much
<PB N="74" REF="012856_0073_0F8B95841CB5CAE0">
applauded Defence of the Charter, &s;ays that <HI>then</HI> a Law in the Plantations may be &s;aid to be repug|nant to a Law made in Great Britain, when it flatly contradicts it &s;o far as the Law made there mentions and relates to the Plantations. But, Gentlemen, there is another Clau&s;e both in the fir&s;t and &s;econd Charter which, I think will &s;erve to explain this or to render all Di&s;pute upon the Con&s;truction of it unnece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;You are ena|bled to impo&s;e &s;uch Oaths only as are warranta|ble by, or not repugnant to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm. I believe you will not contend that the&s;e Clau&s;es mu&s;t mean &s;uch Oaths only as were warrantable at the re&s;pective Times when the Charters were granted. It has often been found nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince the Date of the Charters, to alter the Forms of the Oaths to the Govern|ment by Acts of Parliament, and &s;uch Alterati|ons have always been conformed to in the Plan|tations.</P>
<P>Le&s;t you &s;hould think that I admit the Authority of King Charles the Second in giving his A&s;&s;ent to an Act of the A&s;&s;embly of Virginia, which you &s;ubjoin to the Authorities of James the Fir&s;t and Charles the Fir&s;t, to have any Weight, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you that I do not &s;ee any greater In|con&s;i&s;tency with Magna Charta in the King's giv|ing his A&s;&s;ent to an Act of a Subordinate Legi|&s;lature immediately or in Per&s;on than when he does it mediately by his Governor or Sub&s;titute but, if it could be admitted that &s;uch an A&s;&s;ent di&s;covered the King's Judgment that Virginia was Independent, would you lay any Stre&s;s upon it when the &s;ame King was from Time to Time
<PB N="75" REF="012856_0074_0F8B9584B93CF440">
giving his A&s;&s;ent to Acts of Parliament which in|ferred the Dependence of all the Colonies, and had by one of tho&s;e Acts declared the Plantations to be inhabited and peopled by his Maje&s;ty Subjects of England?</P>
<P>I gave you no Rea&s;on to Remark upon the Ab&s;urdity of a Grant to Per&s;ons born within the Realm of the &s;ame Liberties which would have belonged to them if they had been born within the Realm, but rather guarded again&s;t it by con|&s;idering &s;uch Grant as declaratory only, and in the Nature of an A&s;&s;urance that the Plantations would be con&s;idered as the Dominions of Eng|land. But is there no Ab&s;urdity in a Grant from the King of England of the Liberties and Immu|nities of Engli&s;hmen to Per&s;ons born in and who are to inhabit other Territories than the Dominions of England, and would &s;uch Grant, whether by Charter or other Letters Patent, be &s;ufficient to make them inheritable, or to intitle them to the other Liberties and Immunities of Engli&s;hmen, in any Part of the Engli&s;h Dominions?</P>
<P>As I am willing to re&s;t the Point between us upon the Plantations having been, from their fir&s;t Di&s;covery and Settlement under the Crown, a Part of the Dominions of England, I &s;hall not take up any Time in remarking upon your Ar|guments to &s;hew that &s;ince that Time, they can|not have been made a Part of tho&s;e Dominions.</P>
<P>The remaining Parts of your An&s;wer are prin|cipally intended to prove that, under both Char|ters, it hath been the Sen&s;e of the People that
<PB N="76" REF="012856_0075_0F8B9588DD9CA488">
they were not &s;ubject to the Juri&s;diction of Parli|ament, and, for this Purpo&s;e, you have made large Extracts from the Hi&s;tory of the Colony. Whil&s;t you are doing Honor to the Book, by laying any Stre&s;s upon its Authority, it would have been no more than Ju&s;tice to the Author if you had cited &s;ome other Pa&s;&s;ages which would have tended to reconcile the Pa&s;&s;age, in my Speech to the Hi&s;tory.&mdash;I have &s;aid that, except about the Time of the Anarchy which preceded the Re&s;toration of King Charles the Second, I have not di&s;covered that the Authority of Parliament had been called in Que&s;tion even by particular Per&s;ons. It was, as I take it, from the Principles imbibed in tho&s;e Times of Anarchy that the Per|&s;ons of Influence, mentioned in the Hi&s;tory, di&s;|puted the Authority of Parliament, but the Go|vernment would not venture to di&s;pute it. On the contrary, in four or five Years after the Re|&s;toration, the Government declared to the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners that the Act of Navigation had been for &s;ome Years ob&s;erved here, that they knew not of it's being greatly violated and that &s;uch Laws as appeared to be again&s;t it were repealed, It is not &s;trange that the&s;e Per&s;ons of Influence &s;hould prevail upon great Part of the People to fall in, for a Time with their Opinions and to &s;uppo&s;e Acts of the Colony nece&s;&s;ary to give Force to Acts of Parliament; the Government, howe|ver, &s;everal Years before the Charter was vacated, more explicitly acknowledged the Authority of Parliament and voted that their Governor &s;hould take the Oath, required of him, faithfully to do and perform all Matters and Things enjoined him by the Acts of Trade. I have not recited
<PB N="77" REF="012856_0076_0F8B958997E5DFC8">
in my Speech all the&s;e Particulars, nor had I them all in my Mind but, I think, I have &s;aid nothing incon&s;i&s;tent with them. My Principles in Go|vernment are &s;till the &s;ame with what they ap|pear to be in the Book you refer to, nor am I con&s;cious that, by any Part of my Conduct, I have given Cau&s;e to &s;ugge&s;t the contrary.</P>
<P>Ina&s;much as you &s;ay that I have not particu|larly pointed out to you the Acts and Doings of the General A&s;&s;embly which relate to Acts of Parliament, I will do it now, and demon&s;trate to you that &s;uch Acts have been acknowledged by the A&s;&s;embly, or &s;ubmitted to by the People.</P>
<P>From your Predece&s;&s;ors Removal to America until the Year 1640 there was no Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, and the fir&s;t &s;hort Se&s;&s;ion of a few Days only in 1640, and the whole of the next Se&s;&s;ion, until the withdraw of the King, being taken up in the Di&s;putes between the King and the Parliament, there could be no Room for Planta|tion Affairs. Soon after the King's withdraw the Hou&s;e of Commons pa&s;&s;ed the memorable Order of 1642, and from that Time to the Re&s;toration, this Plantation &s;eems to have been di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t, and the &s;everal Acts or Ordinances, which re&s;pected the other Plantations, were never enforced here, and, po&s;&s;ibly, under Colour of the Exemption in 1642, it might not be intended they &s;hould be executed.</P>
<P>For 15 or 16 Years after the Re&s;toration, there was no Officer of the Cu&s;toms in the Colony, except the Governor annually elected by the
<PB N="78" REF="012856_0077_0F8B958A04D847B8">
People, and the Acts of Trade were but little regarded, nor did the Governor take the Oath required of Governors by the Act of the 12th of King Charles the Second, until the Time which I have mentioned. Upon the Revolution the Force of an Act of Parliament was evident in a Ca&s;e of as great Importance as any which could happen to the Colony. King William and Queen Mary were proclaimed in the Colony, King and Queen of England, France and Ireland, <HI>and the Dominions thereunto belonging,</HI> in the Room of King James, and this not by Virtue of an Act of the Colony, for no &s;uch Act ever pa&s;&s;ed, but by Force of an Act of Parliament which altered the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown, and for which the People waited &s;everal Weeks with anxious Con|cern. By Force of another Act of Parliament, and that only, &s;uch Officers of the Colony as had taken the Oaths of Allegiance to King James deemed them&s;elves at Liberty to take, and ac|cordingly did take the Oaths to King William and Queen Mary. And that I may mention other Acts of the like Nature together, it is by Force of an Act of Parliament that the Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of Hanover &s;ucceeded to the Throne of Britain <HI>and its Dominions,</HI> and by &s;everal other Acts, the Forms of the Oaths have from Time to Time, been altered, and by a late Act that Form was e&s;tabli&s;hed which every one of us has complied with as the Charter in expre&s;s Words requires and makes our Duty. Shall we now di&s;pute whether Acts of Parliament have been &s;ubmitted to when we find them &s;ubmitted to in Points which are of the very E&s;&s;ence of our Con&s;titu|tion? If you &s;hould di&s;own that Authority which
<PB N="79" REF="012856_0078_0F8B958AC157B448">
has Power even to change the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown, are you in no Danger of denying the Authority of our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign, which I am &s;ure none of you can have in your Thoughts?</P>
<P>I think I have before &s;hewn you, Gentlemen, what mu&s;t have been the Sen&s;e of our Predece&s;|&s;ors at the Time of the fir&s;t Charter, let us now, whil&s;t we are upon the Acts and Doings of the A&s;&s;embly, co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">er what it mu&s;t have been at the Time of the &s;econd Charter. Upon the fir&s;t Advice of the Revolution in England, the Au|thority which a&s;&s;umed the Government in&s;tructed their Agents to petition <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Parliament</HI> to re&s;tore the fir&s;t Charter, and a Bill for that Purpo&s;e pa&s;|&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Commons, but went no farther. Was not this owning <HI>the Authority of Parliament?</HI> By an Act of Parliament, pa&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t Year of King William and Queen Mary, a Form of Oaths was e&s;tabli&s;hed to be taken by tho&s;e Prin|ces and by all &s;ucceeding Kings and Queens of of England at their Coronation, the fir&s;t of which is, that they will govern the People of the King|dom <HI>and the Dominions thereunto belonging, ac|cording to the Statutes in Parliament agreed on, and the Laws and Cu&s;toms of the &s;ame.</HI> When the Colony directed their Agents to make their humble Application to King William to grant the &s;econd Charter, they could have no other Pretence than as they were Inhabitants of Part <HI>of the Do|minions of England,</HI> and they al&s;o knew the Oath the King had taken to govern them <HI>according to the Statutes in Parliament;</HI> &s;urely then, at the Time of this Charter al&s;o, it was the Sen&s;e of our Prede|ce&s;&s;ors, as well as of the King and of the Nation
<PB N="80" REF="012856_0079_0F8B958BE61A3238">
that there was and would remain a Supremacy in the Parliament. About the &s;ame Time, they acknowledge, in an Addre&s;s to the King, that they have no Power to make Laws <HI>repugnant to the Laws of England.</HI> And, immediately after the A&s;&s;umption of the Powers of Government by Virtue of the new Charter, an Act pa&s;&s;ed to re|vive for a limitted Time all the Local Laws of the Colonies of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay and New-Plimouth, re&s;pectively, <HI>not repugnant to the Laws of England.</HI> And, at the &s;ame Se&s;&s;ion, an Act pa&s;&s;ed e&s;tabli&s;hing Naval Officers in &s;everal Ports of the Province, for which this Rea&s;on is given, <HI>that all undue Trading contrary to an Act of Parliament made in the 15th Year of King Charles the Second may be prevented in this their Maje&s;ty's Province.</HI> The Act of this Province pa&s;&s;ed &s;o long ago as the &s;econd Year of King George the fir&s;t, for &s;tating the Fees of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers, mu&s;t have relation to the Acts of Par|liament by which they are con&s;tituted, and the Provi&s;ion made in that Act of the Province for extending the Port of Bo&s;ton to all the Roads as far as Cape-Aod, could be for no other Purpo&s;e than for the more effectual carrying the Acts of Trade into Execution. And, to come nearer to the pre&s;ent Time, when an Act of Parliament had pa&s;&s;ed in 1741, for putting an End to certain unwarrantable Schemes in this Province, did the Authority of Government, or tho&s;e Per&s;ons more immediately affected by it, ever di&s;pute the Vali|dity of it? On the contrary, have not a Num|ber of Acts been pa&s;&s;ed in the Province, that the Burdens to which &s;uch Per&s;ons were &s;ubjected might be equally apportioned, and have not all
<PB N="81" REF="012856_0080_0F8B958C607C6800">
tho&s;e Acts of the Province been very carefully framed to prevent their militating with the Act of Parliament? I will mention al&s;o an Act of Parliament made in the fir&s;t Year of Queen Ann; altho' the Proceedings upon it more immediately re&s;pected the Council. By this Act no Office Civil or Military &s;hall be void by the Death of the King, but &s;hall continue &s;ix Months, unle&s;s &s;u&s;pended or made void by the next Succe&s;&s;or. By Force of this Act, Governor Dudley conti|nued in the Admini&s;tration &s;ix Months from the Demi&s;e of Queen Ann, and immediately after, the Council a&s;&s;umed the Admini&s;tration and con|tinued it until a Proclamation arrived from King George, by Virtue of which Governor Dudley rea&s;&s;umed the Government. It would be tedious to enumerate the Addre&s;&s;es, Votes and Me&s;&s;ages of both the Council and Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. I have &s;aid enough to &s;hew that this Government has &s;ub|mitted to Parliament from a Conviction of it's con&s;titutional Supremacy, and this not <HI>from In|con&s;ideration, nor meerly from Reluctance at the Idea of contending with the Parent State.</HI></P>
<P>If then I have made it appear, that both by the fir&s;t and &s;econd Charters we hold our Lands and the Authority of Government not of the <HI>King</HI> but of the <HI>Crown</HI> of England, that being a Dominion of the Crown of England, we are con&s;equently &s;ubject to the Supreme Authority of England, that this hath been the Sen&s;e of this Plantation, except in tho&s;e few Years when the Principles of Anarchy which had prevailed in the Kingdom had not lo&s;t their Influence here; and
<PB N="82" REF="012856_0081_0F8B9592F765AFB8">
if, upon a Review of your Principles, they &s;hall appear to you to have been delu&s;ive and errone|ous, as I think they mu&s;t, or if you &s;hall only be in Doubt of them, you certainly will not draw that Conclu&s;ion which otherwi&s;e you might do, and which I am glad you have hitherto avoided; e&s;pecially when you con&s;ider the obvious and in|evitable Di&s;tre&s;s and Mi&s;ery of Independence upon our Mother Country, if &s;uch Independence could be allowed or maintained, and the Probabi|lity of much greater Di&s;tre&s;s, which we are not able to fore&s;ee.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me if we have not Rea&s;on to fear we &s;hall &s;oon be reduced to a wor&s;e Situation than that of the Colonies of France, Spain or Holland. I may &s;afely affirm that we have not; that we have no Rea&s;on to Fear any Evils from a Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to the Authority of Parliament, equal to what we mu&s;t feel from its Authority being di&s;|puted, from an uncertain Rule of Law and Go|vernment. For more than &s;eventy Years toge|ther the Supremacy of Parliament was acknow|ledged without Complaints of Grievance. The Effect of every Mea&s;ure cannot be fore&s;een by human Wi&s;dom. What can be expected more from any Authority than when the Unfitne&s;s of a Mea&s;ure is di&s;covered, to make it void? When upon the united Repre&s;entations and Complaints of the American Colonies any Acts have appeared to Parliament to be un&s;alutary, have there not been repeated In&s;tances of the Repeal of &s;uch Acts? We cannot expect the&s;e In&s;tances &s;hould be carried &s;o far as to be equivalent to a Di&s;avowal or Relinqui&s;hment of the Right it&s;elf. Why then
<PB N="83" REF="012856_0082_0F8B9593C11271D0">
&s;hall we fear for our&s;elves and our Po&s;terity, greater rigour of Government for &s;eventy Years to come than what we and our Predece&s;&s;ors have felt in the &s;eventy Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t give me Leave, Gentlemen, in a few Words to vindicate my&s;elf from a Charge, in one Part of your An&s;wer, of having, by my Speech, reduced you to the unhappy Alternative of appearing by your Silence to acquie&s;ce in my Sentiments, or of freely di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this Point of the Supremacy of Parliament. I &s;aw, as I have before ob&s;erved, the Capital Town of the Pro|vince, without being reduced to &s;uch an Alter|native, voluntarily not only di&s;cu&s;&s;ing but de|termining this Point, and inviting every other Town and Di&s;trict in the Province to do the like. I &s;aw that many of the principal Towns had fol|lowed the Example, and that there was imminent Danger of a Compliance in mo&s;t if not all the Re&s;t, in Order to avoid being di&s;tingui&s;hed. Was not I reduced to the Alternative of rendering my&s;elf ju&s;tly obnoxious to the Di&s;plea&s;ure of my Sovereign by acquie&s;cing in &s;uch Irregularities, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of calling upon you to join with me in &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing them?

<P>AS a &s;mall Part only of your Excellency's la&s;t Speech to both Hou&s;es is addre&s;&s;ed to the Board, there are but a few Clau&s;es on which we &s;hall Remark.</P>
<P>With Regard to the Di&s;orders that have ari&s;en, your Excellency and the Board have a&s;&s;igned different Cau&s;es. The Cau&s;e you are plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign, together with the Di&s;orders them&s;elves, we &s;uppo&s;e to be Effects ari&s;ing from the Stamp-Act, and certain other Acts of Parliament. If we were not mi&s;taken in this, which you do not a&s;&s;ert, it &s;o far &s;eems to invalidate what is &s;aid in your Speech on that Head.</P>
<P>We have taken Notice of this, only becau&s;e it &s;tands connected with another Matter, on which we would make a few further Ob&s;ervations. What we refer to is the general Nature of Su|preme Authority. We have already offered Rea&s;ons, in which your Excellency &s;eems to ac|quie&s;ce, to &s;hew that, though the Term <HI>Supreme</HI> &s;ometimes carries with it the Idea of <HI>unlimitted</HI> Authority, it cannot, in that Sen&s;e, be applied to that which is human. What is u&s;ually denomi|nated
<PB N="86" REF="012856_0085_0F8B9595FB6A24E0">
the Supreme Authority of a Nation mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be limitted in it's Acts to the Objects that are properly or c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;titutionally cognizable by it. To illu&s;trate our Meaning, we beg Leave to quote a Pa&s;&s;age from your Speech, at the Open|ing of this Se&s;&s;ion, where your Excellency &s;ays, "&s;o much of the Spirit of Liberty breathes through all Parts of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, that although from the Nature of Government there mu&s;t be one Supreme Authority over the whole, yet this Con&s;titution will admit of Subordinate Powers with Legi&s;lative and Executive Authoriy, greater or le&s;s, according to Local and other Cir|cum&s;tances."&mdash;This is very true, and implies, that the Legi&s;lative and Executive Authority granted to the Subordinate Powers &s;hould extend and operate as far as the Grant allows; and that, if it does not exceed the Limits pre&s;cribed to it, and no Forfeiture be incurred, the Supreme Power has no rightful Authority to take away or dimini&s;h it, or to &s;ub&s;titute its own Acts of Ca&s;es wherein the Acts of the Subordinate Power can, according to its Con&s;titution, operate. To &s;uppo&s;e the contrary is to &s;uppo&s;e, that it has no Property in the Privileges granted to it, for if it holds them at the Will of the Supreme Power, which it mu&s;t do by the above Suppo&s;ition, it can have no Property in them: upon which Principle, which involves the Contradiction, that what is granted is in Reality not granted, no Subordinate Power can exi&s;t. But as in Fact the two Powers are not incompatible, and do &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t together, each re&s;training its Acts to their Con&s;titutional Objects, can we not from hence &s;ee how the Supreme Power may &s;upervi&s;e, regulate, and make general
<PB N="87" REF="012856_0086_0F8B9596B83C6C60">
Laws for the Kingdom, without interfering with the Privileges of the Subordinate Powers within it? And al&s;o &s;ee how it may extend its Care and Protection to its Colonies, without injuring their Con&s;titutional Rights?&mdash;What has been here &s;aid concerning Supreme Authority has no Reference to the Manner in which it has been in Fact ex|erci&s;ed, but is wholly confined to its general Nature; and if it conveys any ju&s;t Idea of it, the Inferences that have been at any Time de|duced from it, injurious to the Rights of the Co|loni&s;ts, are not well founded; and have proba|bly ari&s;en from a Mi&s;conception of the Nature of that Authority.</P>
<P>Your Excellency repre&s;ents us as introducing a Number of Authorities merely to &s;hew, that "all Taxes upon Engli&s;h Subjects mu&s;t be levi|ed by Virtue of the Act, not of the King alone, but in Conjunction with the Lords and Com|mons." and are plea&s;ed to add, that "you &s;hould very readily have allowed it; and you &s;hould as readily have allowed, that all other Acts of Legi&s;lation mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame joint Authority, and not by the King alone."&mdash;Your Excellency "would have &s;aved us the Trouble of all tho&s;e Authorities:" and on our Part we &s;hould have been as willing to have &s;av|ed your Excellency the Trouble of di&s;member|ing our Argument, and from thence taking Oc|ca&s;ion to repre&s;ent it in a di&s;advantageous Light, or rather totally de&s;troying it.</P>
<P>In Ju&s;tice to our&s;elves it is nece&s;&s;ary to Reca|pitulate that Argument adduced to prove, that
<PB N="88" REF="012856_0087_0F8B95977727F308">
the Inhabitants of this Province are not con&s;titu|tionally &s;ubject to Parliamentary Taxation. In order thereto we recurred to Magna Charta and other Authorities. And the Argument abridged &s;tands thus&mdash;That from tho&s;e Authorities it ap|pears an E&s;&s;ential Part of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, "that no Tallage, or Aid, or Tax, &s;hall be laid or levied, without the Good-will and A&s;&s;ent of the Freemen of the Commonalty of the Realm." That from Common Law, and the Province Charter, the Inhabitants of this Province are clearly intitled to all the Rights of free and na|tural Subjects within the Realm: That among tho&s;e Rights mu&s;t be included the e&s;&s;ential one ju&s;t mentioned concerning Aids and Taxes; and therefore that no Aids or Taxes can be levied on us con&s;titutionally without our own Con&s;ent &s;ignified by our Repre&s;entatives. From whence the Conclu&s;ion is clear, that therefore the Inha|bitants of this Province are not con&s;titutionally &s;ubject to Parliamentary Taxation.</P>
<P>We did not bring tho&s;e Authorities to &s;hew that Tax Acts, or any other Acts of Parliament, in order to their Validity, mu&s;t have the Con|currence of the King, Lords, and Commons; but to &s;hew, that it has been, at lea&s;t from the Time of Magna Charta, an e&s;&s;ential Right of free Subjects within the Realm, to be free from all Taxes but &s;uch as were laid with their own Con&s;ent. And it was proper to &s;hew this, as the Rights and Liberties, granted by the Province Charter, were to be equally exten&s;ive, to all In|tents and Purpo&s;es, with tho&s;e enjoyed by free and natural Subjects within the Realm. There|fore
<PB N="89" REF="012856_0088_0F8B959B8A409A70">
to &s;hew our own Rights in Relation to Taxes, it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew the Rights of Freemen within the Realm, in Relation to them: and for this Purpo&s;e tho&s;e Authorities were brought, and not impertinently, as we humbly apprehend. Nor have we &s;een Rea&s;on to change our Sen|timents with Re&s;pect to this Matter or any other contained in our An&s;wer to your Excellency's Speech.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t Clau&s;e of your Speech, your Ex|cellency informs the two Hou&s;es, "you are Au|thorized to &s;ay, that his Maje&s;ty will mo&s;t gra|ciou&s;ly approve of every Con&s;titutional Mea&s;ure, that may contribute to the Peace, the Happine&s;s and Pro&s;perity of his Colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay."&mdash;We have the highe&s;t Sen&s;e of his Ma|je&s;ty's Goodne&s;s in his gracious Di&s;po&s;ition to ap|prove of &s;uch Mea&s;ures, which, as it includes his Approbation of the Con&s;titutional Rights of his Subjects of this Colony, manife&s;ts his Inclination to protect them in tho&s;e Rights; and to remove the Incroachments that have been made upon them.

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your Speech at the Opening of the pre|&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion, your Excellency expre&s;s'd your Di&s;plea&s;ure at &s;ome late Proceedings of the Town of Bo&s;ton, and other principal Towns in the Province. And in another Speech to both Hou&s;es we have your repeated Exceptions at the &s;ame Proceedings as being "unwarrantable," and of a dangerous Nature and Tendency; "again&s;t which you thought your&s;elf bound to call upon us to join with you in bearing a proper Te&s;timony." This Hou&s;e have not di&s;covered any Principles advanced by the Town of Bo&s;ton, that are unwarrantable by the Con&s;titution; nor does it appear to us that they have "invited every other Town and Di&s;trict in the Province to adopt their Principles." We are fully con|vinced that it is our Duty to bear our Te&s;timony again&s;t "Innovations of a dangerous Nature and Tendency:" But is clearly our Opinion, that it is the indi&s;putable Right of all or any of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects in this Province, regularly and orderly to meet together to &s;tate the Grie|vances they labor under; and to propo&s;e and

unite in &s;uch con&s;titutional Mea&s;ures as they &s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary or proper to obtain Redre&s;s. This Right has been frequently exerci&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty's Subjects within the Realm; and we do not recollect an In&s;tance, &s;ince the happy Revo|lution, when the two Hou&s;es of Parliament have been called upon to di&s;countenance or bear their Te&s;timony again&s;t it, in a Speech from the Throne.</P>
<P>Your Excellency is plea&s;ed to take Notice of &s;ome things which we "alledge" in our An&s;wer to your fir&s;t Speech; and the Ob&s;ervation you make, we mu&s;t confe&s;s, is as natural and as un|deniably true, as any one that could have been made, that "if our Foundation &s;hall fail us <HI>in e|very Part of it,</HI> the Fabrick we have rais'd upon it, mu&s;t certainly fall." You think, this Foun|dation will fail us; but we wi&s;h your Excellency has conde&s;ended to a Con&s;ideration of what we have "a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">duced in Support of our Principles." We might then perhaps have had &s;ome things offered for our Conviction, more than bare Af|firmations; which, we mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed if we &s;ay, are far from being &s;ufficient, though they came with your Excellency's Authority, for which however we have a due Regard.</P>
<P>Your Excellency &s;ays that "as Engli&s;h Subjects and agreeable to the Doctrine of the Feudal Tenure all our Lands are held mediately or immediately of the Crown." We tru&s;t your Excellency does not mean to introduce the Feudal Sy&s;tem in it's Per|fection; which to u&s;e the Words of one of our greate&s;t Hi&s;torians, was "a State of perpetual

War, Anarchy and Confu&s;ion; calculated &s;olely for Defence again&s;t the A&s;&s;aults of any foreign Power, but in it's Provi&s;ion for the interior Order and Tranquility of Society extremely defective." "A Con&s;titution &s;o contradictory to all the Prin|ciples that govern Mankind, could never be brought about but by foreign Conque&s;t or na|tive U&s;urpation:" And a very celebrated Writer calls it "that mo&s;t iniquitous and ab&s;urd Form of Government by which human Nature was &s;o &s;hamefully degraded." This Sy&s;tem of Ini|quity by a &s;trange Kind of Fatality, "though originally form'd for an Encampment and for Military Purpo&s;es only, &s;pread over a great Part of Europe:" and to &s;erve the Purpo&s;es of Op|pre&s;&s;ion and Tyranny "was adopted by Princes and wrought into their Civil Con&s;titutions;" and aided by the Canon Law, calculated by the Ro|man Pontiff, to exalt him&s;elf above all that is called God, it prevailed to the almo&s;t utter Ex|tinction of Knowledge, Virtue, Religion and Li|berty from that Part of the Earth. But from the Time of the Reformation, in Proportion as Knowledge, which then darted its Rays upon the benighted World, increas'd and &s;pread among the People, they grew impatient under this heavy Yoke: And the mo&s;t virtuous and &s;en&s;ible a|mong them, to who&s;e Stedfa&s;tne&s;s we in this di&s;|tant Age and Climate are greatly indebted, were determined to get rid of it: And tho' they have in a great Mea&s;ure &s;ubdued it's Power and Influ|ence in England, they have never yet totally eradicated its Principles.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="012856_0092_0F8B959FC4112340">
Upon the&s;e Principles the King claimed an ab&s;olute Right to and a perfect E&s;tate in all the Lands within his Dominions; but how he came by this ab&s;olute Right and perfect E&s;tate is a My&s;tery which we have never &s;een unravelled, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> our Bu&s;ine&s;s or De&s;ign at pre&s;ent to en|quire. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e granted Parts of Parcels of it to his Friends the Great Men, and they granted le&s;&s;er Parcels to their Tenants: All therefore derived their Right and held their Lands, upon the&s;e Principles, mediately or immediately of the King; which Mr. <HI>Black&s;tone</HI> however calls "in Reality a meey Fiction of our Engli&s;h Tenures."</P>
<P>By what Right in Nature and Rea&s;on the Chri&s;tian Princes in Europe claimed the Lands of Heathen People, upon a Di&s;covery made by any of their Subjects, is equally my&s;terious: Such however was the Doctrine univer&s;ally prevailing when the Lands in America were di&s;covered; but as the People of England upon tho&s;e Prin|ciples held all the Lands they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Grants from the King, and the King had never granted the Lands in America <HI>to them,</HI> it is certain they could have no Sort of Claim to them: Upon the Principles advanced, the Lord&s;hip and Dominion like that of the Lands in England, was in the King &s;olely: and a Right from thence accrued to him of di&s;po&s;ing &s;uch Territories under &s;uch Tenure and for &s;uch Servies to be performed, as the King or Lord thought proper. But how the Grantees <HI>became</HI> Subjects of England, that is the Supreme Authority of the Parliament, your Excellency has not explained to us. We con|ceive that upon the Feudal Principles all Power
<PB N="94" REF="012856_0093_0F8B95A07ACA56B8">
is in the King; they afford us no Idea <HI>of Parlia|ment.</HI> "The Lord was in early Times the Le|gi&s;lator and Judge over all his Feudatories," &s;ays Judge Black&s;tone. By the Struggles for Liberty in England from the Days of King John to the la&s;t happy Revolution, the Con&s;titution has been gradually changing for the better; and upon the more rational Principles that all Men by Nature are in a State of Equality in Re&s;pect of Juri&s;dic|tion and Dominion, Power in England has been more equally divided. And thus al&s;o in America, though we hold our Lands agreeably to the Feu|dal Principles of the King; yet our Predece&s;&s;ors wi&s;ely took care to enter into Compact with the King that Power here &s;hould al&s;o be equally divi|ded agreeable to the original fundamental Princi|ples of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, declared in Magna Charter, and other Laws and Statutes of England, made to confirm them.</P>
<P>Your Excellency &s;ays, "you can by no Means concede to us that it is now or was when the Plantations were fir&s;t granted the Prerogative of the Kings of England to con&s;titute a Number of new Governments altogether independent of the Sovereign Authority of the Engli&s;h Empire." By the Feudal Principles upon which you &s;ay "all the Grants which have been made of Ame|rica are founded" "the Con&s;titutions of the Emperor have the Force of Law." If our Go|vernment be con&s;idered as merely Feudatory, we are &s;ubject to the King's ab&s;olute Will, and there is no Room for the Authority of Parliament, as the Sovereign Authority of the Briti&s;h Em|pire. Upon the&s;e Principles, what could hinder
<PB N="95" REF="012856_0094_0F8B95A1371C3B08">
the King's con&s;tituting a Number of independent Governments in America? That King Charles the Fir&s;t did actually &s;et up a Government in this Colony&punc; conceding to it Powers of making and executing Laws, without any Re&s;ervation to the Engli&s;h Parliament, of Authority to make future Laws binding therein, is a Fact which your Excellency has not di&s;proved if you have denied it. Nor have you &s;hewn that the Par|liament or Nation objected to it, from whence we have inferred that it was an acknowledged Right. And we cannot conceive, why the King has not the &s;ame Right to alienate and di&s;|po&s;e of Countries acquired by the Di&s;covery of his Subjects, as he has to "re&s;tore upon a Treaty of Peace Countries which have been acquired in War," carried on at the Charge of the Nation; or to "&s;ell and deliver up any Part of his Do|minions to a foreign Prince or State, again&s;t the General Sen&s;e of the Nation" which is "an Act of Power" or Prerogative which your Excellency allows. You tell us that "when any New Coun|tries are di&s;covered by Engli&s;h Subjects, accord|ing to the general Law and U&s;age of Nations, <HI>they become Part of the State.</HI>" The Law of Nations is or ought to be founded on the Law or Rea&s;on. It was the Saying of Sir Edwin Sandis, in the great Ca&s;e of the Union of the Realm of Scotland with England, which is applicable to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, that "there being no Precedent for this Ca&s;e in the Law, the Law is deficient; and the Law being deficient, Recour&s;e is to be had to Cu&s;tom; and Cu&s;tom being in&s;ufficient, we mu&s;t recur to natural Rea&s;on," the greate&s;t of all Authorities, which he adds "is the Law

of Nations." The Opinions therefore, and De|terminations of the greate&s;t Sages and Judges of the Law in the Exchequer Chamber ought not to be con&s;idered as deci&s;ive or binding in our pre|&s;ent Controver&s;y with your Excellency, any further than they are con&s;onant to <HI>natural Rea&s;on.</HI> If however we were to recur to &s;uch Opinions and Determinations we &s;hould find very great Authorities in our Favour, to &s;how that the Sta|tutes of England are not binding on tho&s;e who are not repre&s;ented in Parliament there. The Opinion of Lord Coke that Ireland was bound by Statutes of England wherein they <HI>were named,</HI> if compared with his other Writings, appears manife&s;tly to be grounded upon a Suppo&s;ition, that Ireland had by an Act of their own, in the Reign of King John, con&s;ented to be thus bound, and upon any other Suppo&s;ition this Opinion would be again&s;t <HI>Rea&s;on;</HI> for <HI>Con&s;ent only</HI> gives human Laws their Force. We beg Leave, upon what your Excellency has ob&s;erved of the Colo|ny becoming a Part of the State, to &s;ubjoin the Opinions of &s;everal learned Civilians, as quoted by a very able Lawyer in this Country; "Colo|nies, &s;ays Puffendorf, are &s;ettled in different Methods. For either the Colony <HI>continues a Part</HI> of the Common Wealth it was &s;et out from; or el&s;e is obliged to pay a dutiful Regard to the Mother Common Wealth, and to be in Readine&s;s to defend and vindicate its Honor, and &s;o is united by a Sort of unequal Confederacy; or la&s;tly, is <HI>erected into a &s;eperate Common Wealth</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;umes the &s;ame Rights,</HI> with the State it de&s;cended from." And King Tullius, as quoted by the &s;ame learned Author
<PB N="97" REF="012856_0096_0F8B95A43A5040D0">
from Grotius, &s;ays "We look upon it to be neither Truth nor Ju&s;tice that Mother Cities ought of Nece&s;&s;ity and <HI>by the Law of Nature</HI> to <HI>rule over the Colonies.</HI>"</P>
<P>Your Excellency has mi&s;interpreted what we have &s;aid, "that no Country by the Common Law, was &s;ubject to the Laws or the Parliament but the Realm of England," and are plea&s;ed to tell us that we have expre&s;&s;ed our&s;elves <HI>"Incautiou&s;ly."</HI> We beg Leave to recite the Words of the Judges of Eng|land in the before mentioned Ca&s;e to our Purpo&s;e. "If a King go out of England with a Company of his Servants, Allegiance remain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th among his Subjects and Servants, altho' he be out of his Realm <HI>whereto his Laws are confined,</HI>" We did not mean to &s;ay, as your Excellency would &s;up|po&s;e, that "the Common Law pre&s;cribes Limits to the Extent of the Legi&s;lative Power," though we &s;hall always affirm it to be true of the Law of Rea&s;on and natural Equity. Your Excellency thinks you have made it appear, that the Colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay is holden as feudatory of the Imperial Crown of England;" and therefore you &s;ay, "to u&s;e the Words of a very great Au|thority in a Ca&s;e in <HI>&s;ome Re&s;pects</HI> analogous to it," being feudatory it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that it is under the Government of the King's Laws." Your Excellency has not named this Authority: but we conceive his Meaning mu&s;t be, that be|ing Feudatory, it is under the Government of the King's Law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>ab&s;olutely;</HI> for as we have before &s;aid the Feudal Sy&s;tem admits of no Idea of the Authority of Parliament, and this would have

been the Ca&s;e of the Colony but for the Com|pact with the King in the Charter.</P>
<P>Your Excellency &s;ays, that "Per&s;ons thus hold|ing <HI>under the Crown</HI> of England remain or <HI>be|come</HI> Subjects of England;" by which we &s;up|po&s;e your Excellency to mean, &s;ubject to the Su|preme Authority of Parliament "to all Intents and Purpo&s;es as fully as if any of the Royal Ma|nors, &amp;c. within the Realm had been Granted to them upon the like Tenure." We apprehend with Submi&s;&s;ion, your Excellency is Mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing that our Allegiance is due to the Crown of England. Every Man &s;wears Allegiance for him&s;elf to his own King in his Natural Per&s;on. "Every Subject is pre&s;umed by Law to be Sworn to the King, which is to his Natural Per&s;on," &s;ays Lord Coke. <HI>Rep. on Calvins Ca&s;e.</HI> "The Allegiance is due to his Natural Body." And he &s;ays "in the Reign of Edward II. the Spen|cers, the Father and the Son, to cover the Trea|&s;on hatched in their Hearts, invented this dam|nable and damned Opinion, that <HI>Homage</HI> and Oath of Allegiance was more by Rea&s;on of the King's Crown, that is of his politick Capacity, than by Rea&s;on of the Per&s;on of the King; upon which Opinion they infer'd execrable and dete&s;table Con&s;equents." The Judges of Eng|land, all but one, in the Ca&s;e of the Union be|tween Scotland and England, declared that "Allegiance fol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oweth the natural Per&s;on not the politick;" and "to prove the Allegiance to be tied to the Body natural of the King, and not to the Body politick, the Lord Coke cited the Phra&s;es of diver&s;e Statutes, mentioning our
<PB N="99" REF="012856_0098_0F8B95A4F63C9520">
<HI>natural</HI> liege Sovereign."&mdash;If then the Homage and Allegiance is not to the Body politick of the King, then it is not to him as the Head or any Part of that Legi&s;lative Authority, which your Excellency &s;ays "is equally exten&s;ive with the Authority of the Crown throughout every Part of the Dominion;" and your Excellency's Ob&s;ervations thereupon mu&s;t fail. The &s;ame Judges mention the Allegiance of a Subject to the Kings of England who is out of the Reach and Extent of the Laws of England; which is perfectly reconcil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">able with the Principles of our Ance&s;tors quoted before from your Excellency's Hi&s;tory, but upon your Excellency's Principles appears to us to be an Ab&s;urdity. The Judges, &s;peaking of a Subject, &s;ay, "although his Birth was out of the Bounds of the Kingdom of Eng|land, and <HI>out of the Reach and Extent of the Laws of England,</HI> yet if it were <HI>within the Allegiance of the King of England,</HI> &amp;c. Nor|mandy, Acquitain, Ga&s;coign, and other Places within the Limits of France, and con&s;equently out of the Realm or Bounds of the Kingdom of England, were in Subjection to the Kings of England. And the Judges &s;ay, "<HI>Rex et Reg|num</HI> be not &s;o Relatives, as a King can be King but of one Kingdom, which clearly hold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th not but that his Kingly Power extending to divers Nations and Kingdoms, all owe him equal Sub|jection and are equally born to the Benefit of his Protection, and altho' he is to govern them <HI>by their di&s;tinct Laws,</HI> yet any one of the People coming into the other is to have the Benefit of the Laws where&s;oever he cometh." So they are not to be deemed Aliens, as your Excellen|cy

in your Speech &s;uppo&s;es in any of the Do|minions; all which accords with the Principles our Ance&s;tors held. "And he is to bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Burden of Taxes of the <HI>Place where he cometh,</HI> but living in one or for his Livelihood in one, <HI>he is not to be taxed in the other,</HI> becau&s;e Laws ordain Taxes, Impo&s;itions and Charges as a Di&s;|cipline of Subjection particularized to every par|ticular Nation;" Nothing we think can be more clear to our Purpo&s;e than this Deci&s;ion, of Judges, perhaps as learned as ever adorned the Engli&s;h Nation; or in Favor of America in her pre&s;ent Controver&s;y with the Mother State.</P>
<P>Your Excellency &s;ays, that by our not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;tin|gui&s;hing between the Crown of England and the Kings and Queens of England in their per&s;onal of natural Capacities, we have been led into a fun|damental Error." Upon this very Di&s;tinction we have availed our&s;elves. We have &s;aid that our Ance&s;tors con&s;idered the Land which they took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of in America as out of the Bounds of the Kingdom of England, and out of the Reach and Extent of the Laws of England; and that the King al&s;o even in the Act of grant|ing the Charter, con&s;idered the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">errit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ry as <HI>not within</HI> the Realm; that the King had an ab&s;o|lute Right in him&s;elf to di&s;po&s;e of the Lands, and that this was not di&s;puted by the Nation; nor could the Lands on any &s;olid Grounds be claimed by the Nation, and therefore our An|ce&s;tors received the Lands by Grant from the King&punc; and at the &s;ame Time compacted with him and promi&s;ed him Homage and Allegiance, not in his publick or politick but natural

Capacity only.&mdash;If it be difficult for us to &s;how how the King acquired a Title to this Country in his natural Capacity, or &s;eparate from his Relation to his Subjects, which we confe&s;s, yet we conceive it will be equally difficult for your Excellency to &s;how how the Body Politick and Nation of England acquired it. Our Ance|&s;tors &s;uppo&s;ed it was acquired by neither; and therefore they declared, as we have before quo|ted from your Hi&s;tory, that &s;aving their actual Purcha&s;e from the Natives, of the Soil, the Do|minion, the Lord&s;hip, and Sovereignty, they had in the Sight of God and Man, no Right and Title to what they po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed.

<P>Your Excellency has been plea&s;ed to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">firm, rather than deny or confute a Piece of Hi&s;tory which you &s;ay we took from an anonimous Pam|phlet, and by which you "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear we have been too ea&s;ily m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;led." It may be gathered from your own Declaration and other Authorities be|&s;ides the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Pamphlet, that the Hou&s;e of Commons took Exception, not at the King's having made an ab&s;olute Grant of the Territory&punc; but at the Claim of an exclu&s;ive Right to the Fi&s;hery on the Banks and Sea Coa&s;t, by Virtue of the Patent. At this you &s;ay "the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;e of Commons was ala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">med, and a B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll was brought in for allo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing a free Fi&s;hery." And upon this Occa&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our Excellency allows, that "one of
<PB N="102" REF="012856_0101_0F8B93FB02AE0130">
the Secretaries of State declared that the Plan|tations were not annexed to the Crown, and &s;o were not within the Juri&s;diction of Parliament." If we &s;hould concede to what your Excellency &s;uppo&s;es might po&s;&s;ibly or "perhaps" be the Ca&s;e, that the Secretary made this Declaration "as his own Opinion," the Event &s;howed that it was the Opinion of the King too; for it is not to be accounted for upon any other Principle, that he would have denied his Royal A&s;&s;ent to a Bill formed for no other Purpo&s;e, but to grant his Subjects in England the Privilege of Fi&s;hing on the Sea Coa&s;ts in America. The Account publi&s;hed by Sir Ferdinando Gorges him&s;elf, of the Proceedings of Parliament <HI>on this Occa&s;ion,</HI> your Excellency thinks will remove all Doubt of the Sen&s;e of the Nation and of the Patentees of this Patent or Charter in 1620. "This Nar|rative, you &s;ay, has all the Appearance of Truth and Sincerity," which we do not deny: And to us it carries this Conviction with it, that "what was objected" in Parliament was, the exclu&s;ive Claim of Fi&s;hing only. His imagining that he had &s;atisfied the Hou&s;e after divers Attendances, that the Planting a Colony was of much more Con&s;equence than a <HI>&s;imple di&s;orderly Cour&s;e of Fi&s;hing,</HI> is &s;ufficient for our Conviction. We know that the Nation was at that Time alarmed with Apprehen&s;ions of Monopolies; and if the Patent of New-England was pre&s;ented by the two Hou&s;es as a Grievance, it did not &s;how&punc; as your Excellency &s;uppo&s;es, "the Sen&s;e they then had of their Authority over this new-acquired Ter|ritory," but only their Sen&s;e of the Grievance of a Monopoly of the Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="012856_0102_0F8B93FBC0CED538">
We are happy to hear your Excellency &s;ay, that "our Remarks upon and Con&s;truction of the Words <HI>not repugnant to the Laws of England,</HI> are much the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the Council." It &s;erves to confirm us in our Opinion, in what we take to be the mo&s;t important Matter of Difference between your Excellency and the two Hou&s;es. After &s;aying, that the Statute of 7th and 8th of William and Mary favors the Con&s;truction of the Words as intending &s;uch Laws of England as are made more immediately to re&s;pect us, you tell us, that "the Province Agent Mr. Dummer in his much applauded Defence, &s;ays that <HI>then</HI> a Law of the Plantations may be &s;aid to be repug|nant to a Law made in Great-Britain, when it flatly contradicts it &s;o far as the Law made there mentions and relates to the Plantations." This is plain and obvious to common Sen&s;e, and there|fore cannot be denied. But if your Excellency will read a Page or two further in that excellent Defence, you will &s;ee that he mentions this as the Sen&s;e of the Phra&s;e, as taken from an Act of Parliament, rather than as the Sen&s;e he would chu&s;e him&s;elf to put upon it; and he expre&s;ly de&s;igns to &s;hew, in Vindication of the Charter, that in that Sen&s;e of the Words, there never was a Law made in the Plantations repugnant to the Laws of Great-Britain. He gives another Con|&s;truction much more likely to be the true Intent of the Words; namely, "that the Patentees &s;hall not pre&s;ume under Colour of their particular Char|ters to make any Laws <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent with the Great Charter and other Laws of England, by which the Lives, Liberties, and Properties of Engli&s;h|men are &s;ecure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI>" This is the Sen&s;e in which
<PB N="104" REF="012856_0103_0F8B94022C723068">
our Ance&s;tors under&s;tood the Words; and there|fore they were unwilling to conform to the Acts of Trade, and di&s;regarded them till they made Provi&s;ion to give them Force in the Colony by a Law of their own; &s;aying, that "the Laws of England did not reach America: And tho&s;e Acts were an Inva&s;ion of their Rights, Liberties and Properties," becau&s;e they were not "repre&s;ented in Parliament." The Right of being governed only by Laws which were made by Per&s;ons in who&s;e Election they had a Voice, they looked up|on as the Foundation of Engli&s;h Liberties. By the Compact with the King in the Charter, they were to be as free in America, as they would have been if they had remained within the Realm; and therefore they freely a&s;&s;erted that they "were to be governed by Laws made by them&s;elves and by Officers cho&s;en by them&s;elves." Mr. Dummer &s;ays, "It &s;eems rea&s;onable enough to think that the Crown," and he might have added our An|ce&s;tors, "intended by this Injunction to provide for all its Subjects, that they might not be op|pre&s;&s;ed by Arbitrary Power&mdash;but&mdash;being &s;till Subjects, they &s;hould be protected by the &s;ame mild Laws and enjoy the &s;ame happy Govern|ment as if they continued within the Realm." And con&s;idering the Words of the Charter in this Light, he looks upon them as de&s;igned to be a Fence again&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ion and de&s;potic Power. But the Con&s;truction which your Excellency puts upon the Words, reduces us to a State of Va&s;&s;al|lage, and expo&s;es us to Oppre&s;&s;ion and de&s;potic Power, whenever a Parliament &s;hall &s;ee fit to make Laws for that Purpo&s;e and put them in Ex|ecution.</P>

We flatter our&s;elves that from the large Ex|tracts we have made from your Excellency's Hi|&s;tory of the Colony, it appears evidently, that under both Charters it hath been the Sen&s;e of the People and of the Government that they were not under the Juri&s;diction of Parliament. We pray you again to recur to tho&s;e Quotations and our Ob&s;ervations upon them: And we wi&s;h to have your Excellency's judicious Remarks. When we adduced that Hi&s;tory to prove that the Sentiments of <HI>private</HI> Per&s;ons of Influence, four or five Years after the Re&s;toration, were very different from what your Excellency apprehend|ed them to be when you delivered your Speech, you &s;eem to concede to it by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elling us "it was, as you take it, from the <HI>Principles imbibed</HI> in tho&s;e Times of Anarchy (preceeding the Re&s;to|ration) that they di&s;puted the Authority of Par|liament;" but you add, "the Government would not venture to di&s;pute it." We find in the &s;ame Hi&s;tory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Quotation from a Letter of Mr. <HI>Stoughton,</HI> dated 17 Years after the Re&s;to|ration, mentioning "the Country's not taking Notice of the Acts of Navigation <HI>to ob&s;erve them.</HI>" And it was, as we take it, after that Time, that the Government declared in a Letter to their Agents, that they had not &s;ubmitted to them; and they ventured to "di&s;pute" the Juri&s;diction, a&s;&s;erting that they apprehended the Acts to be an Inva&s;ion of the Rights, Liberties and Properties of the Subjects of his Maje&s;ty in the Colony, <HI>they not being repre&s;ented in Parliament;</HI> and that "the Laws of England <HI>did not reach America.</HI>" It very little avails in Proof that they conceded to the Supreme Authority of Parliament, their

telling the Commi&s;&s;ioners "that the Act of Na|vigation had for &s;ome Years before been ob&s;erv|ed here, that they knew not of its being greatly violated, and that &s;uch Laws as appeared to be again&s;t it were repealed." It may as truly be &s;aid now, that the Revenue Acts are ob&s;erved by &s;ome of the People of this Province; but it can|not be &s;aid that the Government and People of this Province have conceded that the Parliament had Authority to make &s;uch Acts to be ob&s;erved here. Neither does their Declarations to the Commi&s;&s;ioners that &s;uch Laws as appeared to be again&s;t the Act of Navigation were repealed, prove their Conce&s;&s;ion of the Authority of Parliament, by any means &s;o much as their making Provi&s;ion for giving Force to an Act of Parliament within this Province, by a deliberate and &s;olemn Act or Law of their own, proves the contrary.</P>
<P>You tell us, that "the Government four or five Years before the Charter was vacated more explicitly," that is than by a Conver&s;ation with the Commi&s;&s;ioners, "acknowledged the Autho|rity of Parliament, and voted that their Gover|nor &s;hould take the Oath required of him faith|fully to do and perform all Matters and Things enjoined him by the Acts of Trade." But does this, may it plea&s;e your Excellency, &s;how their explicit Acknowledgment of the Authority of Parliament? Does it not rather &s;how directly the contrary: For, what need could there be for their Vote or Authority to require him to take the Oath already required of him by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ct of Parliament, unle&s;s both he and they judged that an Act of Parliament was not of Force &s;ufficient

to bind him to take &s;uch Oath? We do not de|ny, but on the contrary are fully per&s;uaded that your Excellency's Principles in Government are &s;till of the &s;ame with what they appear to be in the Hi&s;tory; for you there &s;ay, that "the pa&s;&s;|ing this Law plainly &s;hows the wrong Sen&s;e they had of the Relation they &s;tood in to England." But we are from hence convinced that your Ex|cellency when you wrote the Hi&s;tory was of our Mind in this Re&s;pect, that our Ance&s;tors in pa&s;&s;ing the Law di&s;covered their Opinion that they were without the Juri&s;diction of Parliament: For it was upon this Principle alone that they &s;hewed the wrong Sen&s;e they had in your Excel|lency's Opinion, of the Relation they &s;tood in to England.</P>
<P>Your Excellency in your &s;econd Speech con|de&s;cends to point out to us the Acts and Doings of the General A&s;&s;embly which relates to Acts of Parliament, which you think "demon&s;trates that they have been acknowledged by the A&s;&s;em|bly or &s;ubmitted to by the People:" Neither of which in our Opinion &s;hows that it was the Sen&s;e of the Nation, and our Predece&s;&s;ors when they fir&s;t took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Plantation or Colony by a Grant and Charter from the Crown, that they were to remain &s;ubject to the &s;upreme Au|thority of the Engli&s;h Parliament.</P>
<P>Your Excellency &s;eems chiefly to rely upon our Ance&s;tors&punc; after the Revolution "proclaiming King William and Queen Mary in the Room o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> King James," and taking the Oaths to them, "the Alteration of the Form of Oaths from

Time to Time," and finally "the Ebabli&s;hment of the Form which every one of us has complied with, as the Charter in expre&s;s Terms requires and makes our Duty." We do not know that it has ever been a Point in Di&s;pute whether the Kings of England were ip&s;o facto Kings in and over this Colony or Province. The Compact was made between King Charles the Fir&s;t, his Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors, and the Governor and Company, their Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors. It is ea&s;y upon this Principle to account for the Acknow|ledgment of and Submi&s;&s;ion to King William and Queen Mary as Succe&s;&s;ors of Charles the Fir&s;t, in the Room of King James: Be&s;ides it is to be con&s;idered, that the People in the Colony as well as in England had &s;uffered under the TYRANT James, by which he had alike for|feited his Right to reign over both. There had been a Revolution here as well as in England. The Eyes of the People here were upon William and Mary, and the News of their being pro|claimed in England was as your Excellency's Hi&s;tory tells us, "the mo&s;t joyful News ever received in New-England." And if they were not ploclaimed here "by virtue of an Act of the Colony," it was, as we think may be con|cluded from the Tenor of your Hi&s;tory; with the general or univer&s;al Con&s;ent of the People as apparently as if "&s;uch Act had pa&s;&s;ed." It is <HI>Con&s;ent alone,</HI> that makes any human Laws bind|ing; and as a learned Author ob&s;erves, a purely <HI>voluntary</HI> Submi&s;&s;ion to an Act, becau&s;e it is highly in our Favor and for our Benefit, is in all Equity and Ju&s;tice to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as not at all proceeding from the <HI>Right</HI> we include in the

And at the &s;ame Time another Act was made for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of other Oaths nece&s;&s;ary to be taken; both which Acts have the Royal Sanction, and are now in Force. Your Excellency &s;ays, that when the Colony applied to King William for a &s;econd Charter, they knew the Oath the King had taken, which was to govern them ac|cording to the Statutes in Parliament, and (which your Excellency here omits) <HI>the Laws and Cu&s;toms of the &s;ame.</HI> By the Laws and Cu&s;toms of Parliament, the People of England freely debate and con&s;ent to &s;uch Statutes as are made by them&s;elves or their cho&s;en Repre&s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a|tives. This is a Law or Cu&s;tom which all Man|kind may ju&s;tly challenge as their <HI>inherent</HI> Right. According to this Law the King has an undoubted Right to govern us. Your Excellency upon Recollection &s;urely will not infer from hence, that it was the Sen&s;e of our Predece&s;&s;ors that there was to remain a Supremacy in the Engli&s;h Parliament, or a full Power and Authority to mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Laws binding upon us in all Ca&s;es whatever, in that Parliament where we cannot <HI>debate</HI> and <HI>deliberate</HI>&punc;upon the Nece&s;&s;ity or Expediency of any Law, and con&s;equently without our Con&s;ent,

and as it may probably happen de&s;tructive of the fir&s;t Law of Society, the Good of the Whole. You tell us that "after the A&s;&s;umption of all the Powers of Government, by Virtue of the new Charter, an Act pa&s;&s;ed for the reviving for a limited Time all the local Laws of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts-Bay and New-Plymouth re&s;pectively, not repugnant to the Laws of England. And at the &s;ame Se&s;&s;ion an Act pa&s;&s;ed e&s;tabli&s;hing Naval Officers, that all undue Trading contrary to an Act of Parliament&mdash;may be prevented." Among the Acts that were then revived we may rea&s;on|ably &s;uppo&s;e was that whereby Provi&s;ion was made to give Force to this Act of Parliament in the Province.

<P>Your Excellency has not thought proper to attempt to confute the Rea&s;oning of a learned Writer on the Laws of Nature and Nations, quo|ted by us on this Occa&s;ion, to &s;hew that the Au|thority of the Legi&s;lature does not extend &s;o far as the Fundamentals of the Con&s;titution. We are unhappy in not having your Remarks upon the Rea&s;oning of that great Man; and until it is confuted, we &s;hall remain of the Opinion, that the Fundamentals of the Con&s;titution being ex|cepted from the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Legi&s;lators, none of the Acts or Doings of the General A&s;|&s;embly, however deliberate and &s;olemn, could avail to change them, if the People have not in very expre&s;s Terms given them the Power to do it; and that much le&s;s ought their Acts and Do|ings however numerous, which barely refer to Acts of Parliament made expre&s;ly to relate to us, to be taken as an Acknowledgment that we are &s;ubject to the Supreme Authority of Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>We &s;hall &s;um up our own &s;entiments in the Words of that learned Writer Mr. Hooker, in his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Policy, as quoted by Mr. Locke, "The lawful Power of making Laws to com|mand whole political Societies of Men, belong|ing &s;o properly to the &s;ame intire Societies, that for any Prince or Potentate of what Kind &s;oever,
<PB N="112" REF="012856_0111_0F8B940D50CE69F8">
to exerci&s;e the &s;ame of him&s;elf, and not from expre&s;s Commi&s;&s;ion immediately and per&s;onally received from God, is no better <HI>than mere Tyranny.</HI> Laws therefore they are not which <HI>publick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p|probation</HI> hath not made &s;o, for "Laws human of what Kind &s;oever are available by Con&s;ent." "Since Men naturally have no full and perfect Power to command whole politick Multitudes of Men, therefore, utterly without our Con&s;ent we could in &s;uch Sort be at no Man's Command|ment living. And to be commanded we do not con&s;ent, when that Society whereof we be a Part, hath at any Time before con&s;ented." We think your Excellency has not proved, either that the Colony is a Part of the politick Society of Eng|land, or that it has ever con&s;ented that the Par|liament of England or Great Britain &s;hould make Laws binding upon us in all Ca&s;es whatever, whether made expre&s;ly to refer to us or not.</P>
<P>We cannot help before we conclude, expre&s;&s;ing our great Concern, that your Excellency has thus repeatedly, in a Manner in&s;i&s;ted upon our free Sentiments on Matters of &s;o delicate a Na|ture, and weighty Importance. The Que&s;tion appears to us to be no other, than Whether we are the Subjects of ab&s;olute unlimitted Power, or of a free Government formed on the Principles of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution. If your Excellen|cy's Doctrine be true the People of this Province hold their Lands of the Crown and People of England, and their Lives, Liberties and Proper|ties are at their Di&s;po&s;al&punc; and that even by Compact and their own Con&s;ent. They are &s;ub|ject to the King as the Head <HI>alterius Populi</HI> of
<PB N="113" REF="012856_0112_0F8B940E03A3B3A0">
another People, in who&s;e Legi&s;lative they have no Voice or Intere&s;t. They are indeed &s;aid to have a Con&s;titution and a Legi&s;lative of their own, but your Excellency has explained it into a mere Phantom; limitted, controuled, &s;uper|ceded and nullified at the Will of another. Is this the Con&s;titution which &s;o charmed our An|ce&s;tors, that as your Excellency has informed us, they kept a Day of &s;olemn Thank&s;giving to Al|mighty God when they received it? And were they Men of &s;o little Di&s;cernment, &s;uch Children in Under&s;tanding, as to plea&s;e them&s;elves with the Imagination that they were ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame Rights and Liberties which natural born Subjects in England enjoyed, when at the &s;ame Time they had fully con&s;ented to be ruled and ordered by a Legi&s;lative a Thou&s;and Leagues di&s;tant from them, which cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ufficiently acquainted with their Circum&s;tan|ces, if concerned for their Intere&s;t, and in which they cannot be in any Sen&s;e repre&s;ented.</P>

<HEAD>On Saturday the 6th of March, his Ex|cellency was pleas'd to put an End to the Se&s;&s;ion, after delivering the following SPEECH to both Hou&s;es, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Council, and Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK it incumbent on me to make &s;ome Ob&s;ervations, before I put an End to the Se&s;&s;ion, upon your la&s;t Me&s;&s;ages to me on the Subject of your Con&s;titutional Dependance upon the Supreme Authority of the Briti&s;h Dominions. As the Council admit a partial Dependence, and &s;uppo&s;e it to be con&s;i&s;tent with the Principles and Nature of Government, I &s;hall only endeavour very briefly to &s;hew the contrary.</P>
<P>In your fir&s;t Me&s;&s;age, Gentlemen of the Coun|cil, you made &s;ome Strictures upon the Nature of the Supreme Authority in Government, both divine and human, the latter of which you deter|mined could not be ab&s;olute and unlimitted. I thought the Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">inction between divine and human Power not pertinent, and in An&s;wer to you, I only remarked, that I had given you no Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e I in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ended a more ab&s;olute Power in Parliament than what is founded in the Nature of Government, and this, in your &s;econd Me&s;&s;age, you con&s;true an Acquie&s;cence in your Rea&s;ons, which it certainly was not. You go on however to explain your Meaning by a&s;&s;erting, that "what is u&s;ually denominated the Supre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e Authority of a Nation mu&s;t be limited in its Acts to the Ob|jects
<PB N="115" REF="012856_0114_0F8B940F4570F990">
that are properly or con&s;titutionally Cogni|zable by it."</P>
<P>Before you thus defined the Nature of Supreme Authority, I wi&s;h you had con&s;idered more fully what Objects there can be in a Government which are not cognizable by &s;uch Authority. You in&s;tance in a <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> Power in Government which, whil&s;t it keeps within its Limits, is not &s;ubject to the Controul of the <HI>&s;upreme</HI> Power. Is there no Incon&s;i&s;tency in &s;uppo&s;ing a <HI>&s;ubordi|nate</HI> Power without a Power <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to it? Mu&s;t it not &s;o far as it is without Controul be, it&s;elf, Supreme?</P>
<P>It is e&s;&s;ential to the Being of Government that a Power &s;hould always exi&s;t which no other Power within &s;uch Government can have Right to with&s;tand or controul: Therefore, when the word <HI>Power</HI> relates to the Supreme Authority of Government it mu&s;t be under&s;tood <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> and <HI>unlimited.</HI></P>
<P>If we cannot agree in the&s;e Principles which no &s;en&s;ible Writer upon Government has before denied, and if you are &s;till of Opinion that two Juri&s;dictions, each of them having a Share in the Supreme Power, are compatible in the &s;ame State, it can be to no Purpo&s;e to Rea&s;on or Argue upon the other Parts of your Me&s;&s;age. Its enough to ob&s;erve that this Di&s;agreement in our Principles will have its Influence upon all the Deductions which are made from them.</P>

I will al&s;o con&s;ider the la&s;t Me&s;&s;age from you, Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, upon the &s;ame Subject, in as few words as the Importance of it will admit.</P>
<P>You &s;ay you have not di&s;covered that the Prin|ciples advanced by the Town of Bo&s;ton are un|warrantable by the Con&s;titution. Whether they are or are not&punc; will depend upon the Determina|tion of the Point which you are now controvert|ing.

Have not the Doings of that Town been &s;ent through the Province, accompanied with a circular Letter, "de&s;iring a free Communication of Sentiments," and, among other Expre&s;&s;ions of the like Ten|dency, lamenting the Extinction of Ardor for civil and religious Liberty if it &s;hould be the ge|neral Voice of the Province, that the Rights as &s;tated do not belong to them, and tru&s;ting that this cannot be the Ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>If the Fundamentals of our Government were not di&s;puted, the&s;e Irregularities would appear to you in a very &s;trong Light and you would join in di&s;countenancing them.</P>

I am now obliged to ob&s;erve that you are again mi&s;led by having a general View of this Doctrine brought before you, as it re&s;pects States or Go|vernments under ab&s;olute Monarchs, and not as it is connected with or grafted upon the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution&punc; I &s;hall not therefore &s;pend Time in examining the Principles of your Sy&s;tem, it being immaterial to the Point between us whether they are ju&s;t or not.

appears to have been made, not by an Act of Regal Power alone but by the Authority of the great Council of the Nation or A&s;&s;embly of the Realm, and the Legi&s;lative Authority &s;till remained, according to its Nature, paramount and above all other Powers in the Dominion, and ac|cordingly from Time to Time the Abu&s;es of the Feudal Power either in the Sovereign or in &s;uch as held under him were corrected by the Supreme Legi&s;lative, and Magna Charta it&s;elf was framed and agreed upon, principally if not altogether for this Purpo&s;e.

The original Claim in the Sovereign, whether at fir&s;t a Fiction or not, &s;o far remained as that all Forfeitures, all E&s;cheats&punc; all new di&s;covered Lands accrued to him&punc; unle&s;s the Supreme Legi&s;|lative &s;hould limit the Right to them, or otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;e of them. This was the State of Feudal Tenure in England at the Time when the fir&s;t Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">r was granted, and the Difference between your Sy&s;tem and mine will appear by this fami|liar In&s;tance: Louis the 13. of France, I think the &s;ame Year the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Patentees obtained the Grant of that Colony, by a Royal
<PB N="120" REF="012856_0119_0F8B9415F90B35E0">
Edict granted to one Hundred A&s;&s;ociates the Country of Canada, with Powers of Government and all the Privileges of natural born Subjects of France to all who &s;hould go and Inhabit or be Born there, with other very great Powers and Privileges. This, then, appears to be the diffe|rent State of the People of the two Colonies. Louis, being an ab&s;olute Monarch, the Regal and Legi&s;lative Power were united in him. The Inhabitants of Canada therefore were &s;ubject to him and to every &s;ucceeding King of France as their Supreme Lord who, by Virtue of his uncon|troulable Power, might at any Time revoke the Royal Edict at Plea&s;ure, or di&s;&s;olve any Charter what&s;oever even though like the famous Edict of Nantes it had been declared irrevocable. Charles, having in him the regal Power only, could Grant no more than was in him, and the Legi&s;lative Power which was in the Parliament mu&s;t &s;till remain there, and con&s;equently the Sub|jects of England continued when in the Colony &s;till &s;ubject to the regal con&s;titutional Power of Charles and the &s;upreme Legi&s;lative Power of Parliament. And, I think, nothing is more cer|tain than that the con&s;titutional Re&s;traint of the regal Power in Charles prevented the Charter from being revoked and annulled in le&s;s than Ten Years after the Date of it.</P>
<P>If this brief Account of Feudal Tenure, as it is Part of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, be ju&s;t, as I &s;hall think it is until I have better Authority than any I have yet &s;een to the contrary, the Fabrick which you have rai&s;ed will &s;till fail of Support, for it wholly depends upon very different Principles,
<PB N="121" REF="012856_0120_0F8B9418357C0058">
and upon what you hope I do not mean to intro|duce, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the Feudal Sy&s;tem in its Perfection. If this Support fails, there is but little Occa&s;ion for me to remark upon the other Parts of your Me&s;|&s;age, and I &s;hall pa&s;s them over, except &s;uch as may tend to make wrong Impre&s;&s;ions upon any unwary Readers.</P>
<P>You cannot conceive "why the King has not the &s;ame Right to alienate and di&s;po&s;e of Coun|tries acquired by the Di&s;covery of his Subjects as he has to re&s;tore upon a Treaty of Peace Coun|tries acquired in War carried on at the Charge of the Nation, or to &s;ell and deliver up any Part of his Dominions again&s;t the general Sen&s;e of the Nation." I will venture to conjecture a Rea&s;on. By the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution the &s;ole Power of making War and Peace is in the King. It often happens that the re&s;toring and ceding Acqui&s;itions made in War is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of Peace, and if the King was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e|&s;trained from &s;uch Re&s;torations or Ce&s;&s;ions an un|&s;ucce&s;sful War might be perpetuated to the De|&s;truction of the Kingdom. This Power there|fore &s;eems nece&s;&s;arily to re&s;ult from this Prero|gative of the Crown. And for &s;elling any Part of the Dominions again&s;t the general Sen&s;e of the Nation I never &s;uppo&s;ed it to be a Part of the Prerogative, but have called it an Act of <HI>Power,</HI> by which I thought no candid Reader would un|der&s;tand any Thing but <HI>meer Power.</HI></P>
<P>Your Attempt to &s;hew that new di&s;covered Countries do not become Part of the State, from the Authority of Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">endorff, &amp;c. will fail, be|cau&s;e

the In&s;tance given by him of a Colony erected into a &s;eparate Common Wealth plainly appears by the Context to be by the Leave or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n&s;ent of the Parent State, and it does not ap|pear that the other Ca&s;es were not &s;o.</P>
<P>Your Remark upon the Authority I bring to &s;hew that the Colony, being feudatory, is under the Government of the King's Laws, is very &s;in|gular. You &s;uppo&s;e it mu&s;t mean the King's Laws <HI>ab&s;olutely,</HI> or as you explain it, not the Laws of Parliament. Do any of you remem|ber ever to have &s;een the Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>the King's Laws,</HI> meaning the King of England, u&s;ed in any other Sen&s;e than <HI>the Laws of the Realm?</HI> You &s;ay I have not named the Authority. The Ca&s;e I refer to is the King again&s;t Crowle, in the 2d. Vol Burrow's Reports, and for the Autho|rity, which you will find mentioned there, I am not able to name a greater.</P>
<P>I would pa&s;s over in Silence your Attempt to &s;hew that Allegiance is due to the natural Per|&s;on and not to the Body Politick of the King, if I had not been well informed that the artificial Rea&s;oning of Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Coke upon the Doctrine of Allegiance, in the noted Ca&s;e of Cal|vin&punc; as you have recited it, had great Weight with &s;ome of the Members of the Hou&s;e. But have you recited this Ca&s;e truly? After all the Re|finements on this Subject does it appear that they can amount to any Thing more than that Alle|giance is not due to the Politick Capacity <HI>only?</HI> And is it not expre&s;ly &s;aid that the natural Per&s;on of the King is ever accompanied with the Politick
<PB N="123" REF="012856_0122_0F8B941901B16920">
Capacity, and the Politick Capacity as it were ap|propriated to the Natural Capacity? Or have you any clear Idea of Allegiance to a King in his natural Capacity without any Relation to his political Capacity? From this Authority mi&s;un|der&s;tood you infer that I am mi&s;taken in &s;uppo|&s;ing your Allegiance to be due to the <HI>Crown</HI> of England. Without any Refinements, it is plain that it was one Condition, on the Performance whereof the fir&s;t Charter depended, that Allegi|ance &s;hould be borne to King Charles his Heirs and <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors.</HI> Wherever therefore the Succe&s;|&s;ion to the Crown &s;hall go there Allegiance is to follow. The Condition in the &s;econd Charter is the &s;ame, and this is enough for my Purpo&s;e, which was to &s;hew that in whatever Per&s;on the Regal Authority &s;hall be, there your Allegiance is due. I wi&s;h you had omitted all you have &s;aid upon this Subject, for neither the Rea&s;oning of Lord Coke, nor the Declarations of the Jud|ges, in any Mea&s;ure tend to the Purpo&s;e for which you produce them.</P>
<P>Your A&s;&s;ertion that Parliament, in regulating the Fi&s;hery, had nothing in View but to prevent a Monopoly of the Sea, and claimed no Authority over the Plantations or Lands in America, has only your own Authority to &s;upport it. It appears from the Debates in Parliament, that it was the Refu&s;al of the Patentees to &s;uffer Fi&s;h to be dried upon the Land within their Patent, by any Per&s;on who had not Licence from them, which was complained of as a Grievance, and the Bill was brought in to remove this Grievance: The King might very well refu&s;e his A&s;&s;ent, not be|cau&s;e

Parliament had no Juri&s;diction, but becau&s;e he did not think fit to join with the Lords and Commons in an Act which invalidated or abridg|ed tho&s;e Privileges in a Patent of Lands which by his Royal Prerogative he had a Right to grant.</P>
<P>I will make no particular Remarks upon tho&s;e Parts of your Me&s;&s;age which relate to the Sen&s;e the People have had of their Con&s;titution, as there can be no End to Di&s;putes upon Facts which by &s;mall Deviations from the true State of them may be made to &s;erve one Side or the other.</P>
<P>It is evident that the fir&s;t Settlers of this Colony left&punc; England with a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of their Depen|dance&mdash;that the Sen&s;e continued until the Prin|ciples of Anarchy in England &s;pread in America, and it is conceded that the&s;e Principles were avowed by many of the Inhabitants here for near twenty Years after they were exploded in Eng|land.

<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Council and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that nice Di&s;tinctions of civil Rights and legal Con&s;titutions are far above the Reach of the Bulk of Mankind to comprehend. There are, however, a few plain fundamental Principles of Government which carry within them&s;elves &s;uch Evidence as cannot be re&s;i&s;ted, and are no &s;ooner propo&s;ed than a&s;&s;ented to&mdash;Such as the&s;e&mdash;That in every Government there mu&s;t be &s;omewhere a &s;upreme uncontroulable Power, an ab&s;olute Authority to decide and de|termine&mdash;That two &s;uch Powers cannot coexi&s;t, but nece&s;&s;arily will make two di&s;tinct States&mdash;That in a State of Society we give up Part of our natural Lib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rty in order to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">cure that legal Freedom which it is the great End of Govern|ment to maintain and pre&s;erve&mdash;That a Right in Individuals or Parts of a Government to judge of the Deci&s;ions of the Supreme Authority and
<PB N="126" REF="012856_0125_0F8B941B433797D8">
to &s;ubmit or not &s;ubmit as they think proper, can|not con&s;i&s;t with a State of Government and mu&s;t work the Di&s;&s;olution of it. Whil&s;t the&s;e Princi|ples had their due Influence we enjoyed all that Freedom and all tho&s;e other Ble&s;&s;ings which a State of Government will admit of. Our Con|nection with our Parent State &s;ecured the&s;e Ble&s;|&s;ings to us, and by Means of a nominal Depen|dence we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as great a Share of real Free|dom as the Parent State it&s;elf upon which we are &s;aid to depend.</P>
<P>I have laid before you, Gentlemen, what ap|peared to me to be the true Con&s;titution of the Province, and recommended an Adherence to it becau&s;e I believed it would re&s;tore us to and continue us in that happy State in which we flou|ri&s;hed &s;o long a Cour&s;e of Years.</P>
<P>Certainly it is of the utmo&s;t Importance to you that the&s;e Points &s;hould be &s;ettled, for I know of no Maxim in the Law of greater Truth than this. <HI>Where the Con&s;titution is conte&s;ted and the Laws are vague and uncertain, there, will be the greate&s;t Slavery.</HI></P>
