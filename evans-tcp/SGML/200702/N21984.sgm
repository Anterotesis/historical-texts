<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS <HI>Volume is &s;ent into the world without apologies, although the Author has many to of|fer: That candour which the ingenuous will always be&s;tow on the productions of one &s;o very young, cannot be increa&s;ed by them; and that di&s;po&s;ition to cen&s;ure, which many are fond of cheri&s;hing, much le&s;s removed. A few of the&s;e Mi&s;cellanies have, previous to their publica|tion here, appeared in the New-York Maga|zine&mdash;The</HI> Young Compo&s;itor, <HI>which is among this number, was written by the Author at a much earlier period of his life than any other performance in&s;erted in this Volume&mdash;He has left it in its original &s;ituation, without altering the egoti&s;ms with which it abounds&mdash;The piece is de&s;igned to expo&s;e the errors of youth.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE YOUNG COMPOSITOR.</HEAD>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the mind has fixed upon a &s;ub|ject as a theme for its reflections, one of the mo&s;t difficult ends is then accompli&s;hed. It is always the ca&s;e with youth, that when they have brought their minds to a mode of thinking, and &s;it down to compo&s;e, their fir&s;t and great|e&s;t difficulty is, on what &s;ubject they &s;hall write. A variety of &s;ubjects are pre&s;ented to their imaginations; but the mind &s;ingles out no one in particular before the others. Dif|ferent
<PB N="14" REF="028973_0020_0FDDC717CECD42C8">
ideas ari&s;e which might tend to the il|lu&s;tration of each of them; and it often hap|pens, that we are longer in choo&s;ing a &s;ubject, than, when this difficulty being overcome, we are in fini&s;hing the compo&s;ition. I remember often to have &s;et down, yet undetermined on what &s;ubject to write, while many were pre|&s;ented to my view: I have at length &s;hewn a little partiality for the plea&s;ures of the Imagina|tion, and have run on within my mind, with out committing it to paper after this manner: "To the imagination man owes &s;ome of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing moments of his life; it wafts him to cele&s;tial regions, un&s;een, untrod, and brings to his contemplative view, tho&s;e beauti|ful and captivating &s;cenes which none but &s;he her&s;elf can paint. It is &s;he that paints the lovely grottos, the verdant vallies and the &s;pread|ing lawns, the retreats of mu&s;es, and the gen|tle &s;treams which meander through them; &s;he brings to the view of the youthful lover, the charming form of his Amelia, and dwells on the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect, when &s;he &s;hall be his.&mdash;She pre&s;ents to youth honor, fame, and re|wards, as&mdash;." Thus far having proceeded, I
<PB N="15" REF="028973_0021_0FDDC758646A6B10">
make a pau&s;e; inward di&s;&s;atisfaction tells me this is not a good &s;ubject, and points to &s;ome other. I then begin on Dancing in the &s;ame manner:&mdash;"Some enthu&s;ia&s;ts have endeavour|ed to &s;hew that dancing is a &s;in; others again, not going quite &s;o far, have exclaimed again&s;t it as a wa&s;te of time: Again&s;t all the&s;e hypocri|tical gentry, I &s;hall endeavour to defend this va|luable accompli&s;hment." I here al&s;o pau&s;e, grow di&s;&s;atisfied, and make a third attempt; for the country with all its charms, now attracts me topaint her in lofty &s;trains.&mdash;"While &s;ome de|light in the tumults of a city; retirement, ea&s;e and &s;olitude point to the rural retreat, where ro&s;y health &s;its enthroned, and where peace and content lead on the gentle train." The wan|dering imagination of youth is not yet content, and I am often forced to ri&s;e without having determined what virtue, or what vice, or what thing &s;hall have the honor of claiming my au|gu&s;t &s;peculative attention. But the &s;ubject be|ing cho&s;en, another difficulty which ari&s;es in the mind of youth, is, how they &s;hall begin: Shall it be by a round about way, as if &s;tealing upon the &s;ubject, and a long preamble? Or &s;hall
<PB N="16" REF="028973_0022_0FDDC71995B2A060">
they come out open and bold and directly tell then &s;ubject. To avoid this la&s;t, is what ren|ders it more difficult to youth, for they look upon it as ungraceful in writing. It is the manner which naturally occurs to their minds and requires &s;ome &s;tudy to avoid. But I think it is a mi&s;taken notion in us, for the chief end of writing is to be under&s;tood, and &s;implicity in &s;tile mu&s;t then be the be&s;t, provided it is not har&s;h and grating to the ear. The former of the&s;e introductions, Dr. John&s;on, in his Ram|bler. abounds with: we have with him a page of reflections, and exclamations, before we know what &s;ubject we are about to meditate upon. It is the manner generally practi&s;ed by flowery writers, and tho&s;e who delight in plea|&s;ing the ear more than improving the mind. But Addi&s;on, who is the &s;tandard of beauty in writing, always introduces his &s;ubject with a reflection, or &s;trikes directly to the point. What a &s;imple and beautiful introduction is the following:&mdash;"There is nothing in which men deceive them&s;elves more than in what the world call zeal. There are &s;o many pa&s;&s;ions which hide them&s;elves under it and &s;o many
<PB N="17" REF="028973_0023_0FDDC759444CE808">
mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing from it, that &s;ome have gone &s;o far as to &s;ay, it would have been for the bene|fit of mankind, if it had never been reckoned in the catalogue of virtues."&mdash;When the &s;ub|ject is cho&s;en and begun, the young Compo&s;i|tor goes on with a tolerable degree of bri&s;kne&s;s his heart begins now to expand with plea&s;ure; and I look upon the delight of the youth in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the compo&s;ition, to be greater than in any other. The greate&s;t impe|diments are now removed, and the &s;tream flows in an uninterrupted and peaceful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The la&s;t difficulty, and let me add al&s;o the &s;mall|e&s;t, to the young compo&s;itor, is the conclu&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. He is led a&s;tray by a fal&s;e idea of grandeur, in terminating his reflection, by &s;electing the mo&s;t &s;onorous and high &s;ounding words, and is re|&s;olved to make his piece end well, let it be of whatever merit.</P>
<P>This puts me in mind of a man who, having lived in the meane&s;t and mo&s;t wicked &s;tile was re&s;olved to die in a mo&s;t magnificent one. I remember at the conclu&s;ion of a little compo&s;i|tion of mine on libels, I was at a &s;tand; but &s;ome in&s;piring angel overcame my difficulty,
<PB N="18" REF="028973_0024_0FDDC71B3A6CAE28">
and whi&s;pered me the following:&mdash;"The cha|racter of a man is of too &s;erious a nature to be thus &s;ported with: For when robbed of it, a per&s;on is de&s;erted by tho&s;e who formerly were his friends, and univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed. To a feeling mind, how wretched is &s;uch a &s;tate. But yet, O envy! &s;hort is thy triumph, for innocence will &s;till prevail, and triumph in her turn.&mdash;She will unfold grim envy's gloomy haunts, and her black form di&s;clo&s;e.&mdash;An ob|&s;ervation I beg leave to make on compo&s;ition in general, is, that mo&s;t youth &s;tudy to write in a flowery &s;tile; this, when it flows naturally, is an evidence of a fertile genius:&mdash;But they ought never to mend the language in which the idea pre&s;ents it&s;elf, unle&s;s it is bad grammar, and expre&s;&s;ions which are har&s;h; for then, as an au|thor expre&s;&s;es it, the language is rai&s;ed, but the &s;trength is fallen. The fault of a young poet I conceive to be his great delight to &s;end invo|cations to the mu&s;es, and to &s;pread throughout the poem the name of youth. Of the invoca|tion, the following is an elegant example:
<Q><L>O come, ye mu&s;es, with a laurel crown,</L>
<L>Pour, O Parna&s;&s;us, pour your torrents down!</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="028973_0025_0FDDC75DF35CED00">
Blow ye poetic zephyrs gently blow,</L>
<L>Ye heavenly choirs, O &s;trike in accents &s;low;</L>
<L>Ye gods immortal, &s;well the pre&s;ent lay,</L>
<L>O Homer, Milton, hearken when I pray.</L></Q></P>
<P>The word more employed than any other by a young poet, and which he can hardly write any poetry without frequently u&s;ing, is &s;oft. He makes the mind the impre&s;&s;ion of the face, and almo&s;t every thing he de&s;cribes &s;oft, as in the following ver&s;es:
<Q><L>Friend&s;hip the off&s;pring of a &s;oul refined,</L>
<L>Where firm &s;incerity and truth re&s;ide;</L>
<L>And the <HI>&s;oft</HI> virtues of a gentle mind,</L>
<L>With generous pity for its feeling guide;</L>
<L>Connects the&s;e girls in &s;tronge&s;t <HI>&s;ofte&s;t</HI> ties,</L>
<L>Array'd in all their <HI>&s;oft</HI> interior grace;</L>
<L>Strong as the lu&s;tre of their &s;parkling eyes,</L>
<L><HI>Soft</HI> as expre&s;&s;ion in their lovely face.</L></Q></P>
<P>But yet after all I have &s;aid, it is a true and common &s;aying, that what is taught by precept, is not &s;hewn by example; for where our incli|nation points, we naturally follow, though at the expence of error. And with much propriety
<PB N="20" REF="028973_0026_0FDDC71FCBAC01B0">
might I here apply to my&s;elf the&s;e words of the poet:&mdash;
<Q><L>"I &s;ee the right and I approve it too,</L>
<L>"Condemn the wrong, and yet the wrong pur&s;ue."</L></Q></P>
<P>Having gone through the&s;e remarks, relative to a young compo&s;itor, let us for a moment draw the curtain, and behold him in his medi|tation, with the in&s;trument of his profe&s;&s;ion in his hand, and Sheridan laying by his &s;ide:&mdash;See, how with eyes &s;teadily fixed on &s;ome ob|ject, and not even allowed to twinkle, and with his elbow placed upon the table, and his head reclined upon his hand, he explores the qualities and appendages of things. Some|times he ca&s;ts his eyes up, and then down, as if in the greate&s;t devotion. See how he knits his brows, claps his pen in his mouth, and rubs his &s;hins with his hands, while the mu&s;e re&s;u&s;es her aid, or in other words, while the young gentleman in unable to recal his &s;catter|ed ideas, or while he has none to recal. But look at him again: See now the plea&s;ant &s;mile that plays upon his countenance, and with what
<PB N="21" REF="028973_0027_0FDDC7618463DEF0">
rapidity he &s;natches his pen that he was former|ly chewing; for the gods have &s;aved it from de&s;truction, by in&s;piring its ma&s;ter with a thought. See how he throws one thigh over the other, and applies his pen to paper, le&s;t he &s;hould lo&s;e what he has this moment found. He now reads over, in rapid accents, his compo|&s;ition from the beginning, to &s;ee how the pre|&s;ent member will &s;uit,&mdash;he gives the &s;mile of approbation;&mdash;and then, as a fowler having killed his bird, beholds it with a &s;mile, and as &s;oon as he has thrown it into his wallet thinks no more of it, but pur&s;ues his game; &s;o does this pre&s;ent pupil of Clio, after having &s;ecured his idea, throw down his head in its prior po|&s;ition, and pur&s;ue his meditation. See now, how boi&s;terously poor Sheridan is handled, for the young gentleman has at length arrived at the conclu&s;ion. His lips are now never &s;till, but continually repeating parts of &s;entences, and mu&s;ically chiming &s;onorous words. See now, when he has committed his conclu&s;ion to paper, &s;ub&s;cribed his name, and printed a FINIS, what looks of &s;elf-approving merit beam from his eyes! Smile now follows &s;mile.
<PB N="22" REF="028973_0028_0FDDC721121AC400">
&mdash;Here then we mu&s;t let the curtain fall, for the young Addi&s;onian is ju&s;t ri&s;ing to give his compo&s;ition a &s;econd reading, and to accompa|ny it with ge&s;tures and empha&s;is, and all the graces of delivery. It is better there &s;hould be but one mouth; let us therefore, be only &s;ilent hearers.</P>

<HEAD>THE YOUNG COMPOSITOR. CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fir&s;t chapter, I drew from nature a few ob&s;ervations concerning the Compo&s;itions of youth: I have traced &s;ome of the chief diffi|culties ari&s;ing in their minds throughout the writing of the compo&s;ition, the faults into which they naturally fall, and I have drawn the curtain and &s;hewn a young Addi&s;onian in his meditation.&mdash;We left him with Demo&s;the|nian eloquence, &s;peaking the effu&s;ions of his brain; he has, no doubt, by this time &s;topped. The former &s;peaker has therefore ventured again to re&s;ume his di&s;cour&s;e, and has pre&s;um|ed that it would not be unentertaining, <HI>&s;hould
<PB N="23" REF="028973_0029_0FDDC7629204DE88">
he advance farther, to tho&s;e who have honored his former little production with their read|ing.</HI> I &s;hall now &s;peak generally of Compo&s;i|tion of its great importance, and of the be|neficial effect of &s;ocieties, in&s;tituted for litera|ry improvement. Young per&s;ons in choo&s;ing a &s;ubject, &s;earch always for that one in which they can mo&s;t indulge a favourite inclination; that on which they can dwell in &s;welling lan|guage do they fail in argument, and wi&s;h to extend the compo&s;ition to a greater length; they always have recour&s;e to example, which every one mu&s;t undoubtedly acknowledge, to be weightier than precept, to effect both the&s;e. I remember I once &s;ingled out patrioti&s;m as my &s;ubject: after having, with much meditation and labour, produced a few remarks, I imme|diately called to my aid the &s;hades of heroes, and in enraptured accents exclaimed:&mdash;</P>
<P>How amiable mu&s;t Warren appear; and how dete&s;table on the other hand, is Arnold; behold, the one nobly dying, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and thus enumerated examples throughout the whole. An ob&s;ervation made by many writers is, that if youth wi&s;h to write a good &s;tile, they mu&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="028973_0030_0FDDC72594DADE00">
continually read &s;ome of the writings of the principal authors, &s;o that they may imbibe their ea&s;y, and graceful expre&s;&s;ions, and elegance of diction. Although this is the &s;entiment of men remarkable for their learning and wi&s;dom, I have yet the audacity to po&s;&s;e&s;s thoughts which di&s;&s;ent from it. That youth ought to read authors, to acquire a &s;tock of ideas, I will not pre&s;ume to deny; for this and practice are the only means by which they are able to become compo&s;itors; but it is only to &s;tile that I allude. No expre&s;&s;ions can be &s;imple, ea&s;y and beauti|ful, without being natural. And can tho&s;e be &s;o which are formed from the writings of ano|ther? mu&s;t they not be affected, and the idea through this affectation, &s;tripped of its force&punc; Similar to the affectation of manners, which dimini&s;hes the power of form and of beauty. Is not the end of all writing to be under&s;tood? If this is the ca&s;e, &s;implicity, is the be&s;t of &s;tiles; and what is &s;implicy but nature. Nei|ther Addi&s;on nor any other of the writers, whom we are told to imitate, ever pur&s;ued this method. In my opinion, he who wi&s;hes to write in the mo&s;t &s;imple and ea&s;y &s;tile, mu&s;t u&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="028973_0031_0FDDC766D99B6798">
expre&s;&s;ions which nature dictates, neither &s;eek|ing ornament, nor rejecting it when it volun|tarily offers it&s;elf. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions which nature dictates, by often practi&s;ing our&s;elves in compo&s;ition, become more refined and beau|tiful.</P>
<P>Did mankind not po&s;&s;e&s;s the power and ble&s;|&s;ing of conver&s;ation, we could not receive that mo&s;t la&s;ting and rational plea&s;ure, ari&s;ing from &s;ocial &s;ociety. It is by this we receive know|ledge and information through communication. Be&s;ides conver&s;ation, compo&s;ition is another mean, by which we make known our &s;enti|ments on different and u&s;eful &s;ubjects. While conver&s;ation confines it&s;elf merely to tho&s;e who con&s;titute &s;ociety, compo&s;ition diffu&s;es its en|lightning rays to thou&s;ands; and while in con|ver&s;ation the &s;entiments which are advanced, are only the impul&s;e of the moment, tho&s;e in compo&s;ition are well dige&s;ted, and accompanied with ea&s;y and graceful language. Compo&s;iti|on is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the mo&s;t u&s;eful branch in polite learning, and with it are connected all branches of &s;cience; ea&s;e and grace in writing have therefore been the &s;tudy of many ages.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="028973_0032_0FDDC726A7B54880">
The advantages of compo&s;ition and the va|riety of &s;tiles have been &s;hewn by many emi|nent authors, and that upon it youth cannot be&s;tow too much labour and attention, provided it is not at the expence of other important &s;tu|dies. Compo&s;ition is the mo&s;t con&s;picuous branch of literature; by it men have ri&s;en to &s;ame, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any depth in &s;cientific knowledge. It is by this that per&s;ons in the lowe&s;t rank and &s;ituation of life, have claimed the attention of a world, and acquired e&s;teem and admiration. How could we without it, advance, with propriety and energy our &s;enti|ments. How could we paint in the de&s;criptive &s;tile, the beauty or the curio&s;ity of any object which has &s;truck our attention. How could we &s;tand the champions of innocence again&s;t all the &s;ophi&s;try of deceit and treachery. How could we paint in proper terms the dete&s;table form of &s;lavery, and dwell on the exalted vir|tues of liberty.</P>
<P>To youth, upon contemplation, compo&s;ition appears an exceeding difficult ta&s;k, and one which they &s;hall never be able to accompli&s;h; but upon practice, their ideas become more re|fined,
<PB N="27" REF="028973_0033_0FDDC767E8077B78">
and their under&s;tandings enlarged: this is one of the principal u&s;es of &s;ociety, for as in all other things, nothing can be acquired without practice, &s;o it is in a more particular degree with regard to compo&s;ition. Let not youth then be intimidated, for after one or two attempts, the way is rendered more plain and easy. In &s;ociety a youth has the advantage of of many examples: he can &s;uit more to his capacity the writings of his equals, he can improve by the critici&s;ms made upon the &s;ame, and he is generally rou&s;ed by the &s;pirit of emu|lation. Of the importance of oratory, we need but &s;lightly hint, for it is daily exempli|fied, at the bar, in the pulpit and in the &s;enate. It is this which &s;o much &s;ways the pa&s;&s;ions of men, one while making them feel a &s;oldier's warmth, and now the &s;oft emotion of &s;ympa|thy. Do any of us wi&s;h to &s;erve our country in the cabinet, or even in the field? this then is an e&s;&s;ential &s;tudy. By this we can enforce what propo&s;ition we wi&s;h to be adopted, and by this we can re-animate the &s;oldier's drooping cou|rage. But &s;hould any per&s;on de&s;pair of be|coming an orator, becau&s;e nature has denied

<HEAD>ON HOPE AND REFLECTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE anticipation of future events, which we conceive will tend to our happine&s;s, elates the mind with joy and plea&s;ure. We are ani|mated by the lively &s;allies of imagination, and with anxious &s;miles ca&s;t forward a &s;earching eye, the beneficial effects ari&s;ing from the de|&s;ired event, appear dre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t beauti|ful colours, and give the mind a captivating glow, which prompts the wi&s;hed embrace. But ah! how often does the long looked for period at length arrive, but only to di&s;appoint the un|happy being, lulled by the giddy flights of a warm imagination, and dreaming of honor, popularity and reward. Led by the fond de|ceiver Hope, the author invokes his &s;olitary mu&s;e; with gloomy plea&s;ure he devi&s;es plans; alone he &s;eeks the hoary genius of reflection,
<PB N="29" REF="028973_0035_0FDDC76976B40B28">
and gives to the world the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his la|bour. The world with frowns receives the gift; no &s;mile breaks through the &s;ullen gloom, and &s;oon a &s;tartling voice, not that of gentle can|dour, bla&s;ts the nouri&s;hed hope of the degraded author. Then from the mu&s;es &s;preading grove he takes his lonely way to where, decaying oaks refu&s;e a cooling &s;hade. No more he &s;ilent ponders on Parna&s;&s;us' flowery banks, but &s;eeks the &s;tagnant pool. Hope fir&s;t &s;educed the hap|le&s;s Chatterton; on her he placed his confi|dence; but alas? he placed them upon a de|ceiver. At length wearied of her promi&s;es, he bani&s;hed her from his melancoly abode, and &s;ought the arms of death. Hope is one of the plea|&s;ing pa&s;&s;ions of the human brea&s;t; it furni&s;hes the mind with employment, beyond what the pre&s;ent time affords. We receive nearly an equal plea&s;ure in anticipating &s;ome future event, as if we realized it. Hope pre&s;ents to us, futuri|ty, while Imagination decorates it in beautiful robes. Without Hope man would lead a dull and unhappy life. It is her which animates him, and calls forth his faculties to action, &s;he gives him &s;erenity and good humour. Hope,
<PB N="30" REF="028973_0036_0FDDC72C5412DEC8">
&s;ays Addi&s;on, is a kind of vital heat in the &s;oul, that cheers and gladdens her when &s;he does not attend to it&mdash;it makes pain ea&s;y and labour &s;weet.</P>
<P>How kind and indulgent does Hope lend her &s;miles on the youthful lover; &s;he conveys him to a beautiful bower, where the ro&s;e, the je&s;&s;a|mine, and the mo&s;t odoriferous flowers lendtheir &s;weet perfume; &s;he there pre&s;ents to his view the object of his affection, and dwells on the future period, when he &s;hall lead her blooming to the altar. When our country calls the &s;oldier to arms, when in &s;ight the ho&s;tile armies ap|proach, and martial mu&s;ic &s;ounds the dreadful on&s;et, what is it that keeps alive the courage of the hero, and bids him undauntedly face the cannon's bellowing mouth. It is the gen|tle &s;oother Hope that glows within his bo&s;om. He hopes he &s;hall be one of that happy number which &s;hall &s;urvive the conflict; that victory will crown his valour, and that his country will receive him with a wreath of laurels. But it was a hope of a different nature, which &s;well|ed the bo&s;oms of the &s;ons of Columbia&mdash;it was not for glory that they un&s;heathed the &s;hining
<PB N="31" REF="028973_0037_0FDDC76D42DA31B0">
&s;word. It was for their injured rights, it was for liberty. Rou&s;ed by the groan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their country, their courage ro&s;e to fury, which breathed vengeance on the foe, &s;tained with the blood of their unhappy countrymen.</P>
<P>There is another power be&s;towed upon man, from which he receives a great &s;ource of plea|&s;ure. This power, which is reflection, though of a nature widely different, &s;eems to be in &s;ome in&s;tances, a little &s;imilar with Hope. Hope anticipates things which are to come, Reflection calls to mind what is pa&s;t; the one is the offspring of that creative power the ima|gination, the other of the memory; the one is elated by the expectation of future happine&s;s, the other looks back with a &s;mile of exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure, on experienced incidents; the one takes its abode in the chearful brea&s;t of youth, the other in the experienced bo&s;om of old age. We may be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s double plea&s;ure from the anticipation of the happine&s;s which an ap|proaching event will confer upon us, and al&s;o, that we cannot fully enjoy one, without reflect|ing upon it. It is hard to determine from which

<HEAD>ON JUVENILE INSTITUTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>I PROPOSE briefly to enquire into the bene|fits which youth receive from &s;ocieties e&s;tabli&s;hed for literary purpo&s;es. There are &s;o many in&s;ti|tutions, formed from this motive, now exi&s;ting, that it is an enquiry of &s;ome importance; the love of them &s;eems to be prevalent in the brea&s;t of every youth. The rational plea&s;ure which we there receive, ab&s;tracting every other bene|fit, de&s;erves &s;ome attention. One of the mo&s;t delightful plea&s;ures which we can enjoy, ari&s;es from intercour&s;e with our fellow man; while in the pre&s;ence of lively and agreeable friends, we bani&s;h all di&s;agreeable reflections from our minds, which at other times would tend to in|terrupt our repo&s;e, and di&s;cour&s;e with harmo|ny and plea&s;ure. There are few who can &s;ay, that they receive no plea&s;ure from a &s;ociety of favourite companions, when engaged in &s;ome literary di&s;pute; and &s;uch who can, are in &s;ome mea&s;ure bereft of the feeling of humani|ty. Such who can, have, through di&s;&s;ipation and vicious pur&s;uit, rubbed off that amiable poli&s;h which attracts human nature in the ten|der
<PB N="40" REF="028973_0046_0FDDC736F926B108">
ties of brotherly love. All will acknow|ledge the pure enjoyments which ari&s;e from a virtuous friend&s;hip; many can judge of it from delightful experience. It is in &s;uch &s;ocieties as the&s;e that they become formed. Young per|&s;ons of the &s;ame age, members of the &s;ame literary &s;ociety, and pur&s;uing hand in hand the &s;ame object, &s;ympathy will be naturally ex|cited in each bo&s;om, and led to form this vir|tuous &s;ensation. The particular objects which the&s;e &s;ocieties pur&s;ue are compo&s;ition; verbal debates and oratory. To explain the u&s;e, and the great nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e branches, to render us great and di&s;tingui&s;hed characters, is need|le&s;s, and is not the &s;ubject of our inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>In favour of &s;ocieties one of the fir&s;t argu|ments which &s;trikes us is Emulation, in a large &s;ociety, where young gentlemen meet for im|provement, and have &s;uch a laudable opportu|nity of di&s;playing to their comrades their good &s;en&s;e and judgment, it is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a motive &s;hould not actuate the brea&s;t, which is not callous to &s;hame and the love of prai&s;e. The &s;ituations and rewards which are offered to their view, mu&s;t &s;timulate every ef|fort

to excel. The Spartans, con&s;cious of the emulation which will always prevail among youth, formed their young warriors into &s;o|cieties, that &s;o, &s;triving who &s;hould excel in the military arts, they might be trained up to all the fatigues and hard&s;hips of war. It was this that rendered the Spartan bands invincible and &s;pread the terror of their name abroad. But not like them we train our&s;elves to &s;cenes of human blood; we &s;trive not to gain the laurel from a brui&s;ed and bleeding adver&s;ary, but we &s;trive to obtain the fragrant myrtle by excelling in literature, and the delight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> arts of peace. Though youth may be led to practi&s;e them|selves in compo&s;ition, without entering &s;ocie|ties; yet I am not acquainted with any other manner in which they are &s;o agreeebly incited to it. Friend&s;hip, the love of prai&s;e, and de&s;ire of improvement, invite them to wan|der in the delightful walks of the mu&s;es, where no thorns ob&s;truct the verdant path. The mode&s;t youth there brings forth his pro|ductions, to the benevolent ear of friend&s;hip, and is not terrified by the expected &s;neers of a moro&s;e critic; but &s;till a fear of di&s;approba|tion,
<PB N="42" REF="028973_0048_0FDDC738593A1588">
and a de&s;ire of prai&s;e, bani&s;h carele&s;&s;|ne&s;s and neglect, from his compo&s;itions and literary exerci&s;es. By reading and experience per&s;ons may acquire a &s;tock of knowledge; they may retain in their minds, various &s;enti|ments and hi&s;torical events, which they have read; but they will never become elegant compo&s;itors, without much practi&s;e. By this they acquire a more regular arrangement of their ideas, and a more free and continued flow of thought and argument. A per&s;on can ne|ver compose an e&s;&s;ay entirely original, without much practi&s;e and inve&s;tigation; the more he practi&s;es, the more his mental faculties become enlarged and refined.</P>
<P>Although a young compo&s;itor ought never to cultivate a &s;tile which is laboured and unnatu|ral; he ought not to &s;eek high-&s;ounding words and the many figures of rhetoric to decorate his compo&s;ition; for the&s;e, in&s;tead of beauty, introduce ob&s;curity in his meaning, and di&s;|play a con&s;iderable &s;hare of pedantry unamia|ble in youth. Many per&s;ons, led by a false ta&s;te, con&s;ider the&s;e as elegance; and in&s;tead of following the ea&s;y and natural path of &s;impli|city,
<PB N="43" REF="028973_0049_0FDDC77B03E5F490">
copy the florid and bomba&s;tic &s;tile of Hervey, which is grating to the ear of the true critic. But yet the har&s;h language of nature ought to be refined. The language in which an idea fir&s;t pre&s;ents it&s;elf to our minds, the manner in which we clothe our&punc; ob&s;ervati|ons in conver&s;ation, which ari&s;e from the im|pul&s;e of the moment, requires con&s;iderable poli&s;h; more accuracy, a more &s;mooth flow of our words, and a more particular arrangement of our periods ought to be ob&s;erved; we ought to adorn our &s;tile with the garb of neatne&s;s, but ought not to deck it with too many flowers, which dimini&s;h its force, and ob&s;cure the beau|ty of its texture. By practice and critici&s;m we are led to &s;eek this beauty of &s;tile, and to &s;hun this gaudy and bomba&s;tic di&s;play of ex|pre&s;&s;ions. When young per&s;ons fir&s;t &s;et out in their pur&s;uit of the Belle Lettres, they are al|mo&s;t always led a&s;tray by this fal&s;e idea of grandeur, but after &s;ome practi&s;e, they de&s;|pi&s;e a &s;tile &s;o effeminate, and endeavour to cultivate a &s;tile, which then, to their more re|fined ta&s;te, appears more perfect. Many ar|guments
<PB N="44" REF="028973_0050_0FDDC7C3CF0B9FA0">
might be produced in favour of Juve|nile in&s;titutions, which ari&s;e from the plea&s;ing exerci&s;e of extemporary di&s;putation; the truly rational and mental plea&s;ure which youth re|ceive from this improving enjoyment, has of|ten been experienced by many to whom I now addre&s;s my&s;elf. From this &s;ource we might trace &s;ome of the mo&s;t weighty arguments in &s;upport of our cau&s;e. But we &s;hall only ge|nerally ob&s;erve, that the fluency of &s;peech which is by this means acquired, the readine&s;s and quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas, the gracefulne&s;s and ease of extemporary delivery, operate great|ly to the advantage of &s;ocieties: per&s;ons, al|though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of cultivated under&s;tandings, acquainted with the works of the hi&s;torical and &s;entimental writers, and although favorite &s;ons of the mu&s;es, if they are not accu&s;tomed to extemporary di&s;putes, they will appear in certain &s;ituations to much di&s;advantage. What is related concerning Addi&s;on, every per&s;on is acquainted with, it is a weighty example of what I a&s;&s;ert; that profound cla&s;&s;ic knowledge which he had acquired, that elegance of diction, and that delicacy of wit, which &s;hine &s;o
<PB N="45" REF="028973_0051_0FDDC77EC40649E8">
con&s;picuous in his writings, could not in this in&s;tance &s;upport him: "He conceived thrice, and brought forth nothing." Thus, this great man, the ornament of Briti&s;h Literature, by not being &s;ufficiently exerci&s;ed in extemporary di&s;putation, gave occa&s;ion to a &s;troke of wit, which mu&s;t have hurt the tender feelings of this mode&s;t and amiable author; for want of this, men, infinitely his inferiors, appeared with more di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre. In &s;ociety, by be|ing often the advocates of a cau&s;e, we bani&s;h that timidity and ba&s;hfulne&s;s, which are al|ways attendant on our fir&s;t attempts at di&s;puta|tion, and which occa&s;ion a perturbation of mind, which greatly confu&s;es the &s;peaker.</P>
<P>I need not mention how exceedingly re|qui&s;ite fluency of &s;peech, and promptne&s;s of thought are to the divine, the lawyer, and the per&s;on who is called upon by his countrymen, to repre&s;ent them in legi&s;lature; they at once appear evident, and need no illu&s;tration. Some per&s;ons have a&s;&s;erted, that youthful in&s;titutions, in&s;tead of being beneficial, are di&s;advantageous to youth. Their principal argument, and the one upon which they build their oppo&s;ition, is,
<PB N="46" REF="028973_0052_0FDDC7C554112560">
that by extemporary di&s;putations, youth are led into a &s;ophi&s;tical manner of rea&s;oning. This I will acknowledge to be an objection of con&s;iderable import. Formidable, however, as it may appear, it is feeble, compared with the many benefits ari&s;ing from &s;ociety. To invalidate this evil, I would ob&s;erve, that it depends mo&s;tly upon the di&s;po&s;itions of per&s;ons, that debates are productive of this harm; and that if youth would only allow the &s;ubject &s;ome inve&s;tigation, upon which they are to di&s;pute; if they are not fond of &s;peaking very often, to di&s;play their talents, although devoid of argu|ment and &s;ub&s;tance, and if they will follow the advice of doctor Blair, by always chu&s;ing that &s;ide of the que&s;tion, which to them ap|pears right, and the mo&s;t advantageous&mdash;Ju|venile In&s;titutions would not be productive of this only evil, which can be maintained again&s;t them.</P>

<P>IT is plea&s;ing to retrace pa&s;t &s;cenes, to bid fond thought ponder on events which were beneficial to us alone as individuals. If this to the rational mind affords a &s;ource of joy, what mu&s;t be the heart-exulting glow of every &s;on of Columbia? What pure delight mu&s;t re|flection kindle in their patriotic bo&s;oms? What mu&s;t be their tender &s;en&s;ations of gratitude and love to an overruling power?

It was this that rou&s;ed the indignation of the inhabi|tants. It was in &s;upport of their injured rights, that the fir&s;t rich blood of freemen was &s;hed at Lexington.</P>
<P>But let us turn our attention to the event which we particularly celebrate this day: It opens a &s;cene, &s;olemn to the tender bo&s;om&mdash;While Britain's unrelentle&s;s &s;oldiery were &s;pill|ing the blood of Americans&mdash;while the &s;pirits of all were damped by un&s;ucce&s;s, and &s;orrow &s;at drooping on each patriot cheek, America calls together her little &s;enate: In &s;low and pen&s;ive &s;teps they move in proce&s;&s;ion to their place of meeting&mdash;they bring the momentous bu&s;ine&s;s of Independence under their &s;erious con&s;ideration&mdash;they reflect on the cruelty which is exerci&s;ed towards America, and, feeling &s;pirit and &s;ublimity, greater than ever entered into a Roman &s;enate, declare the United States Free and Independent.

<P>If &s;uch an awful picture would pre&s;ent it&s;elf to us, were not the love of prai&s;e a principle of the human brea&s;t, to what a variety of good pur|po&s;es mu&s;t it actuate us, and in how many ca&s;es mu&s;t it appear to be the offspring of virtue&mdash;the actions to which it incites are tho&s;e which all mankind admire.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;itions of men are generally inclin|ed to &s;loth and indulgence&mdash;the faculties of the &s;oul would be inactive and dormant, if the de|lightful love of prai&s;e did not bani&s;h their &s;lumbers, and point to an object which entices them in the pur&s;uit of literature and u&s;eful knowledge.&mdash;The love of prai&s;e reforms our man|ners, and makes us &s;tudious to plea&s;e our fel|low-creatures.

courage when under di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances. The love of prai&s;e performs this u&s;eful part, &s;he takes the de&s;pairing hero by the hand, &s;he &s;oothes his bo&s;om by her melodious voice, &s;he whi&s;pers in his ear, the thankfulne&s;s, the grati|tude, the exclamations of joy and the &s;alutation of tho&s;e per&s;ons who&s;e lives and property he has defended and protected: all which await him at his return victorious from the bloody plain. She holds out to his view the wreaths of laurels which his country will entwine around his brows. The&s;e reflections kindle in his bo&s;om a new ardour. He is now not only animated by the in&s;tigations of duty, and the glow of pa|trioti&s;m, but al&s;o by the ju&s;t wi&s;h to acquire the e&s;teem of his country, and win her prai&s;es and her gratitude.

<P>The great Germanicus, on the eve before a bloody battle, in &s;ilent reflection, wandered over the plain, where, freed from the fatigues of the day, his veteran army repo&s;ed in their tents: the noi&s;e of the &s;oldiery, the re&s;ounding of arms, and the loud bla&s;ts of martial mu&s;ic, were hu&s;hed in &s;ilence. With a pen&s;ive melancholy,
<PB N="70" REF="028973_0076_0FDDC7E1C624B930">
he reflected on the great and dreadful &s;cene which was &s;hortly to en&s;ue on the &s;ucceeding day, the fate of his country, and the many brave men who would &s;hed their precious blood in their country's cau&s;e. His great &s;oul was filled with certain &s;en&s;ations, characteri&s;tic of the great warrior, and of the feeling heart&mdash;while thus in &s;olitude he indulged the feelings of hu|manity, he thought he heard &s;ome voices di&s;|cour&s;ing in one of the tents; he approached towards it &s;lowly, and without noi&s;e, until he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> clearly di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e. But! who can de&s;cribe his &s;ensati|ons, the exqui&s;ite glow of his heroic bo&s;om, when he di&s;covered it was him&s;elf&mdash;that it was the prai&s;es of Germanicus which employed the attention of his officers; in&s;tead of courting that re&s;t which the fatigues of the day required, they took more delight in &s;peaking the dictates of their admiring bo&s;oms, and celebrating the glory of their beloved commander. The Ro|man chief pau&s;ed, to indulge his feelings, which expanded with con&s;cious virtue: he heard not the fawning accents of flattery, but the voice of truth, of &s;incerity, and of ju&s;tly acquired

prai&s;e. He returned to his tent, filled with the mo&s;t delightful &s;en&s;ations. The next day, the voice of prai&s;e &s;till vibrating in his ear, and in&s;piring him with an elevation of &s;oul above mortality, he led on his &s;oldiers, eager for bat|tle, and fearful of no danger, when Germanicus was their chief&mdash;The warlike Armenius formed his German bands, and bid defiance to the Ro|man power.

<P>Thus far we have con&s;idered the Love of Prai&s;e as an incitement only to great and noble deeds. It is equally u&s;eful when we de&s;cend from its active influence on the mind, and con|&s;ider it in a character who has already acquired it, and who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the good opinion and e&s;teem of his fellow creatures: In him mankind place their confidence; his influence is exten&s;ive, and his fellow men will always exert them&s;elves to &s;erve and oblige the man

whom they admire&mdash;and when old age creeps upon him, the regard which is manife&s;ted for him, the con&s;cious rectitude of his own con|duct, illumine the &s;mile of &s;atisfaction on his once animated but now wrinkled countenance. Reflection ca&s;ts a &s;oothing view on the time when his laudable exertions extorted from his countrymen the bur&s;ts of applau&s;e, and &s;ilent admiration. Devoid of this principle, as it has now been con&s;idered, man wants one of the pa&s;&s;ions which mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hes him from the brutes; without it, he would &s;hun the face of his fellow man, and become a &s;olitary wander|er of the de&s;art. We have now, in its proper light, con&s;idered the Love of Prai&s;e; the happy effects which Moderation has upon the conduct, when man li&s;tens to her in&s;tructive voice, nor tre&s;&s;pa&s;&s;es beyond her rules. Amiable as the Love of Prai&s;e appears, it may be carried to exce&s;s, whence injury will re&s;ult. We &s;hall now con&s;ider, though but very briefly, the ef|fects of the Love of Prai&s;e, when pur&s;ued be|yond its proper limits.

as particularly an&s;wer his purpo&s;es&mdash;he mu&s;t bid adieu to that liberty and independence of &s;pirit, without which we can never be great. All virtuous men agree in admiring indepen|dence of &s;pirit, which will follow the dictates of duty, again&s;t popular clamour. But he who will pur&s;ue the whims and cour&s;es of pub|lic opinion to gain prai&s;e, will be de&s;pi&s;ed&mdash;to throw a&s;ide all &s;en&s;e of right, and to act in con|formity to the wi&s;hes of party, betrays an ig|noble &s;oul, which is highly degrading. The Love of Prai&s;e, in this &s;ense&punc; overcomes all the tender and amiable feelings of the &s;oul: the voice of con&s;cience is not heard in the execu|tion of actions, which are conceived to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary in the pur&s;uit of its favorite object:&mdash;Virtue, the true &s;ource of e&s;teem and re&s;pect, is bani&s;hed from its pre&s;ence, and vice and meanne&s;s are its bo&s;om friends. The per&s;on actuated by this extravagant thir&s;t, will &s;acrifice the ties of humanity, and all the tender feelings of the brea&s;t.

<P>Izrael Smyly is extremely de&s;irous of acquiring prai&s;e; he is a man endowed with a moderate &s;hare of under&s;tanding, and is <HI>diminitive</HI> in his looks and manners; but, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of human nature, he ca&s;ts a &s;miling eye of approbation upon him&s;elf, and thinks that he is important and con&s;equential to his fellow creatures. In|capable of performing any great actions, and not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of discernment enough to know what a great action is, he has fallen upon a very accommodating plan, in his pur&s;uit; it is compo&s;ed of good nature, acquie&s;&s;ence, and meanne&s;s. In conver&s;ation, he never &s;uffers him&s;elf to contradict a per&s;on, but approves, and &s;milingly bows a&s;&s;ent to all he &s;ays: if he was to a&s;&s;ert that blue is yellow, his refinement of manners would not allow him to &s;ay, "that he pre&s;umed he was mi&s;taken;" but he inclines his head, <HI>gli&s;tening with grea&s;e,</HI> and draws his &s;mooth face into a &s;mile, in token of his conge|niality of &s;entiment&mdash;He will bear in&s;ult with|out

He &s;eeks out and follows every method, in which he can oblige particular per&s;ons, and will run to the other end of the town with the greate&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s and &s;atisfaction, to confer the lea&s;t benefit and favour.</P>
<P>Thus does this poor animal pay all his atten|tion, and worry him&s;elf almo&s;t to death, in the pur&s;uit of an object which &s;neers at him, and flies him with uncommon aver&s;ion.

The name of Mr. Smyly is &s;pread abroad, but it is never pronounced unle&s;s it be to excite diver&s;ion and laughter.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t view, mankind are led to admire actions which participate of bravery; but when reflection and rea&s;on are allowed their proper exerci&s;e, they will appear to be crimes which have di&s;graced human nature, and ought never to be held up for admiration, but for dete&s;tation.</P>

<P>I WRITE to bring forward to public view a truly great man, one who has not met with that encouragement, and been treated with that re&s;pect which his dignity and eminent abilities de|&s;erve. But ah! he is not the only author who has met with mi&s;fortunes. The mighty Ho|mer, Otway, and Butler, were the children of poverty. If in tracing the life and writings of this &s;on of the Mu&s;e, though I write not with the pen of Pathos and elegance, but with the pen of commi&s;eration and truth, I &s;hall excite in the brea&s;t of the public, the emotions of ad|miration,

and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their former neglect, that by the&s;e they may become the pa|trons and encouragers of Pega&s;us Helicon, my whole de&s;ign will be an&s;wered. If my feeble pen is able to accompli&s;h this, my &s;atisfaction and plea&s;ure will be greater than that which attended Virgil and Milton, after they had &s;een their poems crowned with wreaths of lau|rels. They wrote one may &s;ay, to acquire lite|rary fame, I write to excite in the brea&s;t the mo&s;t amiable &s;en&s;ations, and to be of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. The &s;ubjects of their writings were mo&s;tly fictitious. Pega&s;us Helicon de|mands my pen, not as an imaginary but real be|ing. Shake&s;peare, who has been pronounced immortal, obtained his name by being an ori|ginal writer. Pega&s;us Helicon is entirely an original writer, and what is more extraordinary, in a period of 178 years after Shake&s;peare, when many more di&s;coveries had been made. The manner in which I came to be fir&s;t ac|quainted with Mr. Helicon is this: As I was reading one day a &s;mall production, on what &s;ubject I do not rightly remember, I per|ceived &s;ome lines of poetry, which were an in|vocation

to the Mu&s;e, written in &s;uch a &s;u|blime manner, that they wonderfully excited my admiration&mdash;the two fir&s;t lines I can only re|collect.&mdash;
<Q><L>O come ye Mu&s;es with a laurel crown,</L>
<L>Pour O Parna&s;&s;us, pour your torrents down.</L></Q></P>
<P>As I was extremely plea&s;ed, I was naturally led to enquire who the author of them was. Af|ter much trouble I found that his name was Pega&s;us Helicon; that the author of the pro|duction in which they were printed, was &s;o captivated by their charms, that he exhibited them to the public with high encomiums. I now knew the name of the man, but I had not yet &s;een him, my curio&s;ity was now rather more excited than appea&s;ed. I long made a fruitle&s;s &s;earch to di&s;cover a per&s;on to introduce me to him; at length, lucky chance threw in my way, that friend of his, who quoted his ver&s;es; he very politely offered to introduce me to Mr. Helicon&mdash;On our way towards the Poet's lodging, my friend informed me of many of his peculiarities; one of which was, that he never &s;haved, but &s;uffered his beard to take its natural growth.&mdash;We had now walked a con&s;iderable way, when

my friend at la&s;t &s;topped at a tall board hou&s;e; he pointed to the top of the hou&s;e, and de&s;ired me to follow him. He led me through a winding &s;tairs which brought us to the garret of the hou&s;e, where I di&s;covered a little room pe|titioned off in the we&s;t corner, which he inform|ed me was Mr. Helicon's &s;tudy. He told me to approach without noi&s;e for fear we might di&s;turb his meditation; we advanced on tiptoe to the door, and was ju&s;t lifting up the latch to en|ter, when we heard a voice within repeat aloud,
<Q><L>A&s;&s;i&s;t thy Helicon to &s;ing the times.</L></Q></P>
<P>My friend now opened the door, and addre&s;s|ing Mr. Helicon, introduced me to him: He be&s;towed upon me a gracious &s;mile, and friendly nod, with which I thought my&s;elf highly ho|nored. His beard was brown and thin; he had a long gown rapped round him, and the &s;prig of &s;ome tree twined round his head: He was &s;itting on a three legged &s;tool, with a long pen in his hand, and &s;ome loo&s;e papers lying before him; there were no chairs in the room, but a long bench, upon which he invited us to &s;it down: He then threw a&s;ide his pen, carefully put up

<Q><L>Lie there my wreath, I never thee will u&s;e,</L>
<L>But when I &s;ing and court the peaceful Mu&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>We now conver&s;ed about the news of the day, in the cour&s;e of which, I di&s;covered that Mr. Helicon was a good Republican; but he &s;aid he did not trouble him&s;elf much about things done abroad, being occupied by more important bu&s;ine&s;s in his room. I then took the liberty of a&s;king him, if his country called upon her &s;ons to fight her battles, if he would not then &s;eize his mu&s;quet, and &s;eek the ho&s;tile plain? He &s;miled, took up his pen, which lay upon the table, and &s;aid, Demo&s;thenes and Cicero, with their tongues, were &s;aid to have done more good for their country, than ten thou&s;and men could have effected. They fought not them&s;elves, but in&s;pired the heroes with &s;trength, courage, and with enthu&s;iasm, in defence of their coun|tries&mdash;&s;o will I with my pen.</P>

to the company of great men, ventured to compliment him concerning his excellent poetry, &s;ome of which I mentioned I had &s;een, and to humbly beg the favor, that he would gratify me with the peru&s;al of one of his late&s;t poems. With plea&s;ing &s;miles he returned my compliments, and with extreme politene&s;s told me, that it was his wi&s;h to gratify all who ho|nored him with their friend&s;hip. He then took up one of his papers which lay upon the table, and told me, that the la&s;t piece he had fini&s;hed was blotted and written very badly; he, there|fore, would even read it him&s;elf for us.

<P>We now changed the conver&s;ation, by a&s;king him why he &s;uffered his beard to grow to &s;uch a length? Why, gentlemen (&s;ays he) my rea&s;ons are forcible, and founded on the firm ba&s;is of propriety. A beard you will all allow to be a &s;ign of wi&s;dom; a poet then, the greate&s;t of

terre&s;trial beings, ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s that which gives an idea of wi&s;dom. A beard adds a grave|ne&s;s to the face, &s;trikes an awe into the illiterate crowd, and commands from all veneration and re&s;pect. Secondly&mdash;A beard was be&s;towed upon man by nature&mdash;ought man, therefore, to de|clare war again&s;t nature, by clipping off his beard? Certainly not; it is a crime nearly allied to &s;uicide. Providence &s;ays, that we have no right to di&s;po&s;e of that life which he has be&s;tow|ed upon us&mdash;Certainly then we have no right to di&s;po&s;e of that beard which he has be&s;towed upon us, and which is one of the greate&s;t orna|ments of human nature, but ought to allow na|ture to take its cour&s;e. Nothing is really beau|tiful, but what is natural, and as Providence has formed man with nothing but what is either u&s;eful or ornamental. The beard mu&s;t belong to one of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es. Therefore, to cut off the beard takes away part of the augu&s;t form of man&punc; and depreciates his beauty. But the ty|rant fa&s;hion &s;ays the beard &s;hall be cut, <HI>O tempora! O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> Thirdly and la&s;tly, Horace &s;ays every poet ought to encourage a philosophic beard. Besides, all the great men of antiquity po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="88" REF="028973_0094_0FDDC7F730FF26E0">
long beards, &s;uch as Homer the prince of poets, and Socrates who was pronounced the wi&s;e&s;t of women. Women have got no beards, why do not women po&s;&s;e&s;s beards as well as men? Becau&s;e nature has implanted the greater wi&s;dom in man, and has placed the beard as a &s;ign of it. It is from the&s;e weighty&punc; con&s;iderations, gentlemen, that I &s;uffer my beard to grow. Swayed by the poet's rea&s;oning, we now perfectly coincided with him in &s;entiment, and lamented the pre|vailing cu&s;tom which obliged us to cut our beards. Animated by our applau&s;es, he pro|ceeded farther in his defence of beards, and told us he had written a poem on beards which he would do him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of reading to us. He then, from out of a little box which &s;tood by him, took a paper and read as follows:
<Q><L>I &s;oftly ask of thee Erato to be heard,</L>
<L>While I who lately &s;ang of wi&s;dom &s;ing the beard.</L>
<L>Awake! O come! thou gen'rous, &s;weetly &s;miling maid,</L>
<L>Pega&s;us' bo&s;om with thy flowing fire invade.</L>
<L>O beard, thou truly noble and maje&s;tic thing,</L>
<L>How many glorious, u&s;eful cau&s;es from thee &s;pring.</L>
<L><PB N="89" REF="028973_0095_0FDDC7BD732DD268">
A certain gravity thou adde&s;t to the face,</L>
<L>'Tis nought but thou that con&s;titut'&s;t real grace,</L>
<L>See when the bard thy flowing foliage &s;hakes,</L>
<L>The vulgar croud &s;tands aw'd or to &s;wift flight betakes.</L></Q></P>
<P>He thus proceeded to enumerate the many happy effects the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a beard received, and concluded the whole with the&s;e two elegant lines,
<Q><L>O beard! let it be thine thy poet's chin to ble&s;s,</L>
<L>And it be his thy charms and beauty to care&s;s.</L></Q></P>
<P>We paid the tribute of applau&s;e to this ele|gant poem, and proceeded to other conver&s;ation; we now took the liberty to a&s;k Mr. Helicon why he did not get married&mdash;he &s;urveyed us with a &s;mile, and exclaimed with great &s;urpri&s;e, Married? Why, gentlemen, am not I a poet, to whom matrimony ought to be an entire &s;tranger? a poet ought to have no wife but the Mu&s;e; as well might you a&s;k a man why he does not ki&s;s the mouth of a &s;erpent, as me.&mdash;Why don't you get married! Why, gentlemen, a woman in a little while would talk me into a con&s;umption, and a &s;qualling brat would &s;care the Mu&s;e away from my dwelling, &s;o that &s;he never dare again enter it.&mdash;And laying a&s;ide all this, the fatigues of the connubial &s;tate would render me an unfit

champion of the Mu&s;e. After &s;ome other con|ver&s;ation, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to depart. I was &s;o fortunate as to gain the good opinion of Mr. Helicon; he invited me to vi&s;it him often, and to become the friend of a neglected poet. Honored by the friend&s;hip of &s;o great a man, I &s;ought every opportunity in my power to enjoy his agreeable and improving conver&s;ation. One day when I was in his room long &s;ub&s;equent to this, and we were talking about poetry, which was always Mr. Helicon's favourite topic, I asked him what he thought of the poets of America&mdash;why (returned he) America has produced many emi|nent &s;ons of the Mu&s;es, of my&s;elf I &s;hall decline &s;peaking. The four fir&s;t poets, in my opinion, are Barlow, Trumbull, Freneau, and Dwight. I &s;hall not, Sir, point out to you their beauties and defections, I only Sir, give you my opinion of them. Barlow's vi&s;ion of Columbus I e&s;teem one of the fir&s;t productions of the age. Trum|bull's M'Fingal is a &s;pecies of poetry &s;o wide|ly different from the vi&s;ion of Columbus, that they cannot be compared together. I think that he far &s;urpa&s;&s;es Peter Pindar the great wit of Britannia. Freneau's productions are mi&s;cellaneous, and di&s;cover a poet who
<PB N="91" REF="028973_0097_0FDDC7BE92ACB748">
writes with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, his lines &s;eem to flow without any labour. He &s;eeks not for Me|taphors, nor to give a kind of ob&s;curity to his meaning, but he courts &s;implicity. Among his many pretty performances, I think his Briti&s;h Pri&s;on Ship is one of the mo&s;t happy. The lines with which he concludes it are the&s;e:
<Q><L>The years approach which &s;hall to ruin bring</L>
<L>Your lords, your chiefs, your mi&s;creant of a king,</L>
<L>Who&s;e murd'rous acts &s;hall &s;tamp his name accurs'd,</L>
<L>And his la&s;t triumphs more than damn the fir&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>Dwight's Conque&s;t of Canaan di&s;covers a genius for poetry; in it are many beautiful, and &s;ome that I may call &s;ublime lines; but I think there are &s;ome lines which the poet did not un|der&s;tand him&s;elf; at lea&s;t, I could not. He is very fond of making every thing that &s;hines with lu&s;tre to ape and mimic day, &s;uch as &s;words, ar|mour, and ve&s;tments. But his Conque&s;t of Ca|naan, although a production of much merit, is not his mo&s;t happy performance.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to &s;peak of &s;ome other American poets, and I thought his ob&s;ervations on all were very ju&s;t and pertinent. In the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation, at this time. I a&s;ked

Mr. Helicon how old he was? I am (answered he) about 45 years old, I was born in the year 1749, on the 14th day of May. You may per|ceive by this, that nature never produces any thing remarkable without &s;ufficient &s;igns and cau&s;es. The awful thunder does not &s;end its threatening roar, the rains do not de&s;cend in li|quid floods, when the &s;ky is beautiful and &s;e|rene, but they are foretold by dark and gloom clouds, which ob&s;cure the face of the heavens. Thus, you &s;ee that I was not a poet without &s;ufficient cau&s;es&mdash;Nature, to be &s;ure, formed me for a poet, but &s;he &s;ent al&s;o &s;igns proclaiming me at my birth. I was born, you perceive, in the lovely &s;miling month of May when the waving lawns, the verdant vallies and the fragrant gardens, are clothed in their mo&s;t beau|tiful dre&s;&s;es, and &s;end forth their mo&s;t exqui&s;ite fragrance. It is in this month, when the poets are &s;o much delighted and captivated by the charms of rural and retired life; it is now they &s;eek the murmuring &s;treams and cooling &s;hades, it is now that the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions pervade the bo|&s;oms of the &s;hy and lovely maidens.&mdash;In this month, mo&s;t favourable to poets, I was born.

One of the other &s;igns which di&s;covered in me the great poet, was the attachment and the great turn I had for poetry in my young and tender years. During the late war between Britain and America, as I was formed not for war like Virgil and Horace, I remained undi&s;|turbed, cultivating the Mu&s;e in a little village far from the din of arms, and the &s;ound of the martial trumpet. After the peace, I returned to New York, where I have ever &s;ince devoted my&s;elf to poe&s;y, that cele&s;tial, <HI>heavenly</HI> maid, and ever will, until I &s;ink within the arms of death. I now took my leave of the poet for this time&mdash;I had not returned, and remained but a few hours at home, before a boy came to my hou&s;e, and delivered a note directed to me; I opened it and read as follows:
<Q><L>Surrounded by the iron fang of woe,</L>
<L>On thee my friend my angui&s;h'd feelings flow.</L>
<L>Pegasus' bosom heaves the rattling &s;igh,</L>
<L>And &s;oftly wi&s;hes that my friend was by,</L>
<L>That he could li&s;ten to my &s;treaming grief,</L>
<L>And &s;quirt within my &s;oul &s;ome kind relief.</L>

<P>By this note I concluded that &s;omething had happened to my friend Helicon; I therefore directed my &s;teps towards his dwelling as fa&s;t as my limbs could carry me. When I ar|rived there, the fir&s;t objects that &s;truck my eyes, were the poet with his wreath of leaves on his head, &s;tanding between two con&s;tables who <HI>had him</HI> &s;eized by the collar. As &s;oon as Mr. Heli|con &s;aw me, he began to apologize for his note, and begged that I would make allowances for it, as he was obliged to write and &s;end it by the boy in the &s;pace of two or three minutes, as the&s;e barbarians would not allow him more time: that he di&s;covered an error in it, and a very material one; it was, that he had put <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ng</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>fangs.</HI>&mdash;The con&s;tables then interrupted him, by telling me, that they had orders to come and take the gentleman and conduct him to goal for debt; that he long owed the landlord of the hou&s;e for boarding and lodging, which
<PB N="95" REF="028973_0101_0FDDC832D675B9B0">
he would not pay. I then informed them that I would &s;tand his bail and become an&s;werable for all the debts he had incurred. The con&s;ta|bles then, with apologies, took their departure. Mr. Helicon, with bo&s;om overflowing with gra|titude, poured forth his thanks for my kindne&s;s in animated and elegant language.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the only &s;ketches of the life and manners of Pega&s;us Helicon I have been able to draw together, that I might place before the public the great and a&s;toni&s;hing man they have long neglected. I have declined bringing for|ward many of his works, as he &s;oon intends to publi&s;h them, but the few which are here exhi|bited bear wonderful marks of genius. I have now fini&s;hed my melancholy tale.&mdash;Do, O thou propitious genius which hovers over the heads of the virtuous, &s;mile upon my feeble efforts, and ble&s;s the poet, who&s;e noble principles and ac|tions are the &s;ubjects of my pen.</P>

<HEAD>ON POETRY.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the plain language of in&s;truction, the imagination of man has ri&s;en to the lively and flowing mu&s;ic of poetry.</P>
<P>Poetry, among the polite arts, holds a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed rank; it is the language of pa&s;&s;ion and fancy: At what time it was invented we know not, the Greeks be&s;towed the honour of it upon Orpheus an ancient bard of theirs. Almo&s;t every man of genius, if he was to turn his attention towards poetry might become a poet, but yet as in oratory many of the principal ingredients which con&s;titute a poet, ought to be inherent: It is &s;aid concerning Cowley and &s;ome others of the principal poets, that they were born in rhimes, which ev&iacute;nces, that a natural genius towards this particular art was inherent in them. When we &s;eek only &s;olid in&s;truction, we refer to the philo&s;ophical writer, who&s;e &s;entiments are con|veyed in the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple manner of pro&s;e, where there is no flowers and delightful &s;cenes, but the worn and rugged paths of &s;cience. But when we &s;eek principally amu&s;e|ment
<PB N="101" REF="028973_0107_0FDDC838C2A2B690">
blended with in&s;truction, we explore the beautiful walks of the mu&s;es, where the &s;en&s;es are more captivating, and where nature promi&s;|cuou&s;ly ri&s;es to our view. Be&s;ides amu&s;ement, improvement is a principal de&s;ign of poetry, and indeed when properly conveyed in this man|ner, it is more attractive to the memory of man, as it more fixes his attention, and captivates his imagination. It harmonizes the &s;oul, and ani|mates it more than &s;entiments produced in any other manner. The brea&s;t of &s;en&s;ibility is touched by its pen&s;ive &s;train, and drops the ten|der tear of compa&s;&s;ion, for virtue in di&s;tre&s;s; the pathetic, therefore, when executed in this manner is generally &s;ucce&s;sful. Its mu&s;ical and winning accents &s;teal upon the heart, and lull it into meditation. Poetry has an effect in heightening the &s;en&s;ibility.&mdash;To the poet the garden of nature appears with double charms; none reli&s;h like him beautiful and grand pro&s;|pects, and receive them with an equal impre&s;|&s;ion: from them none are equally &s;oothed with him by the &s;oft and trembling &s;trains of poetry. While &s;ome flee from the un&s;ocial a&s;pect of &s;oli|tude, the poet delights in her lonely and &s;e|que&s;tered
<PB N="102" REF="028973_0108_0FDDC7FE4F9B8B60">
&s;eats; he courts her as the parent of reflection, and a&s;&s;i&s;tant to his &s;trains, reclined beneath her cooling &s;hade, where nought can di&s;turb his meditation: he li&s;tens to the mu&s;ic of the grove, and the di&s;tant fall of &s;ome running &s;tream.&mdash;It is there he receives the in&s;piration of the Mu&s;e; in &s;uch retired places, &s;he chu&s;es her abode.</P>
<P>More agreeable to the view of the poet is the tall tree, and the rugged mountain top, than the populous cities, lofty &s;pires, and the mo&s;t im|proved architecture:&mdash;more plea&s;ing the rude hand of Nature, than the poli&s;hed hand of art:&mdash;&s;weeter to him is the wild note of the tuneful bird, than the organs artificial &s;ound. That the love of rural retreats has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the brea&s;t of almo&s;t every poet, is a truth no one will doubt. It was this that made Pope delight in his &s;eat at Twickenham, whence flowed a &s;tream as &s;mooth and maje&s;tic as his &s;ong. It was this that led Shen&s;tone to form the Lea&s;owes, where he might call the mo&s;t beautiful flowers to deck his pen&s;ive Pa&s;torals.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the&s;e, which are happy effects of poetry upon the mind, it is charged with often|times
<PB N="103" REF="028973_0109_0FDDC83A4B425300">
rai&s;ing our natural &s;en&s;ibility to &s;uch a pitch as to make life almo&s;t a burden to us: the mind ruffled and unea&s;y by the bu&s;tle and tumult of the world, and creative of imaginary trou|bles. This, no doubt, may be &s;ometimes the ca&s;e; we may find &s;ome unhappy examples of it, but we &s;hall al&s;o di&s;cover that the&s;e exam|ples were entire votaries of the Mu&s;e, and confined them&s;elves almo&s;t wholly to the elegiac &s;tile, the effect of which on the mind, in this re&s;pect, is greater than that of any other &s;pe|cies of poetry.&mdash;We mu&s;t ob&s;erve a very ma|terial difference between the writer and the reader, for it is impo&s;&s;ible that an author can tran&s;mit to the reader, the emotion which he him&s;elf realized, in writing &s;ome melancholy &s;train. Poetry, as an accompli&s;hment, is de|lightful in the female &s;ex: it di&s;covers their re|finement of mind, their delicacy of thought, and liveline&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion. It would occupy &s;ome of their mo&s;t agreeable hours, and afford amu&s;ement for their friends. It mu&s;t al&s;o ren|der them more admired by the other &s;ex, as it adds another charm to the number they po&s;&s;e&s;s, their mu&s;ical notes as coming from one of their
<PB N="104" REF="028973_0110_0FDDC803656EBF98">

<HEAD>ON DESCRIPTIVE POETRY.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the divi&s;ions under which poetry is arranged, there is none which appears to me more amu&s;ing and in&s;tructive than the de&s;criptive.&mdash;It draws all its &s;cenes and reflections from nature; writings of all kinds which de&s;cribe Nature, work more than others upon the imagination, and fix the attention; and indeed, there is no kind of poetry more worthy the attention of the poet, than the de&s;criptive.&mdash;He here has a wide field for the full exerci&s;e of his mu&s;e, the country with all her charms is open to his view. The painter with his pencil pre&s;ents us with &s;ome beautiful

He points to us the variegated land&s;cape and all the beauties of nature, he carries us over the verdant vallies, to the refre&s;hing coolne&s;s of a &s;preading grove, and leads us by the &s;ide of murmuring &s;treams; like a friend and compa|nion he conver&s;es with us, and from the pro&s;|pects, draws plea&s;ing and improving reflections. The reader almo&s;t fancies him&s;elf in the &s;itu|ation which the poet repre&s;ents, and his brea&s;t is lulled into the pen&s;ive meditation, which the &s;urvey of a beautiful land&s;cape really be&s;tows. Thomp&s;on among the de&s;criptive poets holds a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank; no author could ever have cho&s;en a more beautiful and plea&s;ing &s;ubject than the Sea&s;ons, and no author, I make bold to &s;ay, within the &s;ame compa&s;s, could have done the &s;ubject more ju&s;tice; he abounds with the beautiful and pathetic, and carries us through all the delightful &s;cenes in nature; that per&s;on who can read this author without being greatly entertained, I &s;hould doubt his ta&s;te and &s;en|&s;ibility.

<P>If we attend to &s;ome of the principal poets, we will di&s;cover that it is from productions of the de&s;criptive kind, that they have derived the mo&s;t fame. Some of Milton's mo&s;t admired &s;entences are de&s;criptive of nature, his L'Allegro and Il Pen&s;ero&s;o are both of the de&s;criptive cla&s;s. Thomp&s;on, although he has written many other excellent poems, and one of the be&s;t tragedies in the Engli&s;h language, obtains almo&s;t all his fame from his Sea&s;ons. Pope, who made tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> curious compari&s;on of &s;auces, and who has ca&s;t upon it many &s;atirical reflections, little knew that it was from his ma&s;terly de&s;criptions, he chiefly acquired his immortal name. The cele|brated Warton in his E&s;&s;ay on Pope, gives it as as his opinion, that it is from the&s;e three per|formances Pope has acquired principally his re|putation, his Wind&s;or Fore&s;t, Rape of the Lock, and his Epi&s;tle of Eloi&s;a to Abelard; and all the&s;e dwell chiefly on de&s;cription.

<HEAD>ON ELEGIAC POETRY.</HEAD>
<P>ALL per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of refined ta&s;tes are &s;u&s;ceptible of the charms of poetry. Some men have indeed affected to de&s;pi&s;e it; but perhaps the fable of the fox and the grapes may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure applicable to them. The exam|ples are numerous, that men who have &s;hone as &s;tate&s;men and eminent literary characters, have not had certain qualifications inherent in them, nece&s;&s;ary to the attainment of this &s;ublime art. Perhaps there is no &s;pecies of poetry of which the mind is more &s;u&s;ceptible than elegy. There is none perhaps which meets with more agreeable reception from all cla&s;&s;es of men. Its objects are to excite the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, to repre&s;ent to us the di&s;tre&s;s of virtue, and the many misfor|tunes to which human nature is liable. Connec|ted with its principle de&s;ign to infu&s;e into us pity and &s;orrow, it conveys &s;entiments which experience partly dictates, and which are im|proving and &s;triking. In many in&s;tances, elegy is calculated to excite a rougher feeling than &s;ympathy, and to kindle in the mind indignation again&s;t &s;ome unfeeling wretch, who is introduced
<PB N="112" REF="028973_0118_0FDDC80B12637948">
in the poem as a perpetrator of the mo&s;t inhu|man cruelties. When elegy cau&s;es the&s;e &s;en|&s;ations, it mu&s;t operate in forming the mind to virtue, and in cultivating the amiable and ten|der feelings.</P>

<BIBL>TO A YOUNG NOBLEMAN.</BIBL>
<P>There have been &s;ome critics who have en|deavoured to deprive Ma&s;on and Gray of &s;ome of their poetic laurels; but without &s;ucce&s;s. The under&s;tandings and the brea&s;ts of the true lovers of poetry, have ever be&s;towed the highe&s;t approbation on their feeling Mu&s;e: the moro&s;e critic and envious rival may &s;narl and bark, but a certain criterion inherent in the poetic bo&s;om will always pay the tribute of applau&s;e. Gray has found many defenders to vindicate the injur|ed cau&s;e of his Mu&s;e. When the plaintive bard paid his la&s;t debt of nature, he left behind his beloved Ma&s;on to pour in &s;olitude his &s;train, and to be the champion of his friend. Mr.

Temple in his life of this poet pronounces him to be the mo&s;t learned man in England, and that without having made the lea&s;t application, and without the expectation of &s;uch an event, he was appointed profe&s;&s;or of hi&s;tory in Oxford College. Nor did Temple write with the en|thu&s;ia&s;m of friend&s;hip, for among the nume|rous virtues of Gray, he relates his blemi&s;hes and faults.</P>
<P>The next poet I &s;hall mention is Mickle, the elegiac champion of the beautiful and un|fortunate Mary Queen of Scots. There ap|pears to me a great &s;imilarity between the &s;train of Ma&s;on and Mickle. How far my opinion is ju&s;t, the reader can judge.

It is remarkable that the amiable and more tender feelings of &s;oul, particularly a di&s;po|&s;ition for friend&s;hip, di&s;tingui&s;h the celebrated writers of elegy, more than the other ranks of poets. The&s;e four whom I have mentioned are eminent examples of it. Mickle, in the&s;e ver&s;es I have ju&s;t quoted, with all the tender glow of friend&s;hip, and the &s;moothne&s;s and harmony of the poet, &s;trikes his plaintive lyre, in honour of his decea&s;ed Pollio<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pollio was Mickle's brother, the natural affection of brotherly love was heightened in the poet's bo&s;om by e&s;teem and friend&s;hip.</HI></NOTE>. He makes the groves and the lawns, the places where they had formerly roamed together, the partakers of his &s;orrow.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Elegiac writer I &s;hall mention, is Mr. Merry, or Della Cru&s;ca, the delightful corre&s;pondent of Anna Matilda. He breathes in many lines the pure &s;train of poetry; as doth al&s;o his fair admirer Matilda. In no place do I as much feel the pathos of his pen, as where he breaks out into the &s;orrowful mu&s;ic of elegy.

<HEAD>ON HISTORY. THE PROPER STUDY OF MANKIND IS MAN&mdash;Pope.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no &s;ubject more intere&s;ting to mankind, and from which they receive greater improvement and plea&s;ure, than from a &s;urvey of the tran&s;actions which have happened in the world&mdash;Inquiries after the events which have taken place among our predece&s;&s;ors and fore-fathers, are natural to the human mind. They &s;eem to be connected with us and relative to our own &s;tate. The mi&s;eries which have befell great and good men, although upwards of one thou&s;and years ago, excite in our brea&s;ts the tender emotion of di&s;tre&s;s, and we rejoice when Fortune &s;miles propitious on their laudable exertions. Our bo&s;oms glow with hatred and di&s;gu&s;t towards tho&s;e tyrants, who have inflicted the mo&s;t &s;hocking cruelties on their unhappy &s;ubjects. We feel our indignation rou&s;ed for the ingratitude which cities have &s;hewn towards their Generals, who have led their armies to con|que&s;t and victory; and we &s;hed the tears of &s;orrow over the ruins of a once populous city,
<PB N="149" REF="028973_0155_0FDDC875DA4B9528">
which war has levelled to the ground. It is a cau&s;e of joy that the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;tudy is at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t entertaining; that hi&s;tory, when it delights us greatly increa&s;es our know|ledge. When we are peru&s;ing a book of the drye&s;t and mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e kind, if the thought oc|curs that we are enlarging our mental faculties, we receive plea&s;ure; but it is an enjoyment of a much higher kind than this, which is derived from hi&s;tory. When viewing its engaging pages, we want not the reflection of improve|ment, to keep awake our attention; for keep this away entirely, the animating language of hi&s;tory, the curious events and the delightful &s;cenes with which it abounds, will &s;till capti|vate the mind. Human nature is pre&s;ented to our view. Every per&s;on is concerned in the events which happen to each other. If a friend relate to us &s;ome remarkable occurrences which have happened in the world, or the manners of a di&s;tant country; plea&s;ure glows upon our countenances, we feel intere&s;ted and lend the attentive ear. Of a nature &s;imilar to this is the plea&s;ure which we receive from hi&s;tory. The tran&s;actions, the manners, and the lives of
<PB N="150" REF="028973_0156_0FDDC8B860AA78F8">
a people, and of individuals, are there related in the elegant language of the hi&s;torian. The impre&s;&s;ions which hi&s;tory makes upon the minds of tho&s;e per&s;ons, &s;u&s;ceptible to the ami|able and finer feelings, tend to refine the man|ners, and to promote the cau&s;e of virtue. When we admire exalted and noble &s;entiments in per&s;ons, and &s;ee their excellence, we feel a de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s them, and our bo&s;oms expe|rience the &s;en&s;ations of emulation and appro|bation.</P>
<P>The many objects which hi&s;tory holds up for our imitation, is one of its principal ad|vantages. When the life of an amiable man is pre&s;ented to us, we feel deeply intere&s;ted in his welfare, our feelings flow congenial, and receive impre&s;&s;ions corre&s;ponding to the various circum&s;tances and afflictions through which he pa&s;&s;es. In mourning for him when under a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, we mourn for virtue.</P>
<P>When we admire any character, and as we are naturally led to imitate it; if we are una|ble to obtain all the excellencies which con&s;ti|tute it, we may yet much profit our&s;elves by our laudable attempts. The accompli&s;hed and

virtuous Scipio placed Cyrus as a model; as a warrior, as a &s;tate&s;man, and as a man, and in all the&s;e he equalled, if not excelled him. It was by holding to his view that Prince's virtue, that he in the bloom of youth performed that act of continence for which he has been greatly celebrated. Does the bo&s;om of the &s;oldier pant to emulate heroic virtue? Does he wi&s;h to perform valorous actions in his country's cau&s;e? Let him turn over the pages of the Grecian and Roman hi&s;tory&mdash;There the deeds of warriors will &s;well his military brea&s;t, and command wonder and admiration&mdash;the deeds of patriots, who&s;e thundering arms enthu&s;ia&s;m nerved in their country's defence. In &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment, he will pau&s;e at the names of a Themi&s;tocles, Leonidas, and Epaminondas; a Camillus, Cincinnatus, Regulus, and Brutus. Does the more peaceful patriot delight to &s;erve his country in the Cabinet? Let him view the Grecian and Roman &s;tate&s;man when the go|vernments were in their primitive &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Does the youthful brea&s;t glow with a de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;waying powers of oratory; to ap|pear as an eloquent champion in his country's
<PB N="152" REF="028973_0158_0FDDC8BD30BB8A48">
intere&s;ts? As an incitement let him behold the orator of Greece, who&s;e voice like lightning fired the bo&s;oms of the Athenians with an in|vincible ardour in their country's cau&s;e; and the Roman orator, who&s;e more &s;oft and melodious accents, almo&s;t imperceptible &s;tole upon the mind, and &s;wayed the gentle and milder pa&s;|&s;ions.

<P>As the mind is naturally led to imitate an ob|ject which it admires, con&s;equently it will be naturally led to avoid one which it dete&s;ts.

knowledge is increa&s;ed, when we trace the dif|ferent forms of government, their peculiar maxims and laws, the duties of the various exe|cutive powers; the privileges and manners of the people; the manner in which governments took their ri&s;e, and the degeneracy and parti|cular evils which occa&s;ioned their downfal. By &s;eeing the&s;e, we can reap in&s;truction, and guard again&s;t the evils which ari&s;e in govern|ments. From the hi&s;tories of all nations we obtain this precept, that governments e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, though on the mo&s;t wi&s;e and Republi|can principles, generally degenerate into ty|ranny. The art to render our&s;elves agreeable to our fellow-creatures in &s;ocial intercour&s;e, to be&s;tow upon them &s;atisfaction and plea&s;ure, and to excite in their minds an e&s;teem and regard for us, which is nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ociety, is one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and de&s;irable qualifications we
<PB N="154" REF="028973_0160_0FDDC8BE5B5B72D0">
can obtain. The variety of events and of cha|racters in hi&s;tory, will always furni&s;h us with &s;ome examples illu&s;trative of the &s;entiment we have advanced; which will not only plea&s;e our company, but enforce the a&s;&s;ertion. The cau&s;e that renders a traveller plea&s;ing and e&s;teemed in conver&s;ation, ari&s;es not from his &s;uperior un|der&s;tanding, but from the great number of cu|rious and entertaining incidents, which he re|tains in his memory and introduces in &s;ea&s;on|able and applicable opportunities. The reader of hi&s;tory obtains his knowledge at a much easier and cheaper rate than the traveller; he experiences not the many inconveniencies to which the other is liable; the ve&s;&s;el bears him not, on the ruffled bo&s;om of the ocean to &s;ome di&s;tant country, far from his relations and friends. The many evils to which men are &s;ubjected to in this world for want of fore&s;ight; the guile and deceit of mankind render the knowledge of human nature of the greate&s;t im|portance; without it the &s;miles of the deceiv|ing villain would be named &s;incerity, and the ma&s;k of hypocri&s;y, friend&s;hip and love.

of human nature, being a great incite|ment to our exertions in the pur&s;uit of it: it is a &s;tudy exceedingly curious and plea&s;ing&mdash;It makes us acquainted with our&s;elves from which alone we can form an idea con&s;iderably accu|rate of the human mind at large. What is more delightful to the intelligent and enquir|ing mind, than to contemplate on the various pa&s;&s;ions which have actuated the &s;oul; the great lengths which certain impul&s;es have hur|ried human beings beyond the limits of mode|ration and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>What more a&s;toni&s;hing? than the &s;ublime works of the Deity, who made and created all things, and by who&s;e power they &s;till retain their various movements and exi&s;tence. The means to obtain an object of &s;o much impor|tance as the knowledge of human nature, mu&s;t be held by every per&s;on in the greate&s;t e&s;|timation. There are only two ways, expe|rience and hi&s;tory. The one of which is clu&s;|tered with thorns and briers and painful to the lacerated traveller; but the other a delightful path ornamented with verdure and flowers, where the cooling &s;hadow of the &s;urrounding
<PB N="156" REF="028973_0162_0FDDC8C2CFB96FB8">
trees protect us from the parching heat of the &s;un.</P>
<P>In hi&s;tory the many &s;chemes which are con|trived to decoy per&s;ons, the characteri&s;tics of a de&s;igning villain, the fawning and friendly de|meanor of the flatterer, teach us to be aware, and to keep an eye of &s;u&s;picion upon many per&s;ons. Without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of hi&s;tory, the young &s;tudent, ju&s;t proceeding from his &s;tudy into the deceitful world, would fall into many &s;nares and evils: for the di&s;po&s;ition and pa&s;|&s;ions of human nature are not &s;o widely diffe|rent, that the de&s;igns and arts which were prac|ti&s;ed in the Greek and Roman nations are no &s;imilar with tho&s;e in the pre&s;ent age. I &s;hall not now proceed farther to relate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> many and great advantages derived from hi&s;tory. I have endeavoured to give a brief &s;ketch of &s;ome of the principal ones. Con&s;idering the plea&s;ure and great importance of this branch of litera|ture, it is &s;urpri&s;ing that there are in many youth entirely unacquainted with it.</P>
<P>When the names of ancient heroes and &s;tate&s;men are mentioned in their hearing, they are at a lo&s;s and make an aukward appearance.
<PB N="157" REF="028973_0163_0FDDC88011278A60">
The ignorance of hi&s;tory in &s;ome youth pro|ceeds not from their want of reading, but from the manner in which they read. When they take up a hi&s;tory, they attend wholly to the amu&s;ement which it affords them, and not to the improvement. Hence they &s;kim it over &s;o quick and &s;uperficially, that in a &s;hort time it becomes entirely era&s;ed from their minds. The advice which authors have recommended to us when reading hi&s;tory, is, to pay a parti|cular attention, to reflect for a con&s;iderable time on &s;ome &s;cene which has rai&s;ed our feel|ings, for without this, when we proceed to other events we cannot receive a deep and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion from it.</P>
<P>The author which I much admire for his &s;implicity of &s;tile, and all the other qualifica|tions of a hi&s;torian, is Rollin. By reading his volumes alone we can acquire a comprehen&s;ive knowledge of ancient hi&s;tory. In no part of his volumes have I ever &s;ound him languid and unentertaining; after having de&s;cribed &s;ome things that are &s;triking, he often draws from them plea&s;ing and improving reflections. Plutarch's Lives, although they come under
<PB N="158" REF="028973_0164_0FDDC8C3544C4A00">
the title of biography, I may here very proper|ly recommend as part of the hi&s;tory of the country in which they lived, are involved in the lives of his augu&s;t characters. Gillies and Gold&s;mith's hi&s;tories of Greece are both very improving, but Gillies gives a more compre|hen&s;ive view of manners, cu&s;toms and liter|ature. Gibbon is a &s;plendid hi&s;torian, and often decoys the mind more to the &s;tile than the &s;ub&s;tance. Hume excells in the hi&s;tory of England&mdash;Robert&s;on, who has lately paid the debt of Nature, in my opinion, is one of the mo&s;t elegant hi&s;torians in the Engli&s;h language; his Charles the fifth and hi&s;tory of America are the be&s;t arguments I can offer.</P>
<P>The introduction to Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory writ|ten by the learned and celebrated orator Bo&s;&s;uet, ought to be the favorite companion of every youth. In a very &s;mall compa&s;s he gives a general idea of all the principal events which have pa&s;&s;ed in the world. He accurately di&s;|tingui&s;hes the periods and &s;ituation of occur|rences, which pre&s;ents his readers when peru|&s;ing exten&s;ive hi&s;tories, from falling into certain errors, from confu&s;ion, and from placing events
<PB N="159" REF="028973_0165_0FDDC8841BF40568">
in their improper places. Voltaire has be|&s;towed much prai&s;e upon this performance, than which none has ever obtained greater; he &s;ays&mdash;"The Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory of Mr. Bo&s;&s;uet is a work that will tran&s;mit the author to Im|mortality."</P>
<P>A late author has written the hi&s;tory of Rome, France, and Spain. The hi&s;tory of France, of the&s;e, I have only read, it appears to me to bear the marks of a ma&s;terly hand; I would recommend it with his other two performances to the attention of my fellow youth.</P>
<P>I have not recommended all the&s;e authors from my own weak judgment only, but from the approbation of many di&s;tingui&s;hed characters in literature.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF ELVIRA.</HEAD>
<P>COLONEL Armenius had long been an of|ficer in the army; his brea&s;t had long felt the noble glow of patrioti&s;m, and long had he &s;ought the battles of his country&mdash;while he was engaged in the di&s;cord and tumults of a camp, his family were retired in a country &s;eat of his &s;ome miles di&s;tant from London, mourning his ab&s;ence. At la&s;t growing too aged for the fa|tigues
<PB N="172" REF="028973_0178_0FDDC8D18E9F0AC0">
of the war, he returned home with his hoary head encircled with the wreaths of laurel which his valor had won, to enjoy dome&s;tic happine&s;s in the bo&s;om of his family; he brought with him a gentleman of the name of Mr. Tollard, who had long with him &s;up|ported the dangers of war, and who&s;e brea&s;ts were united together by the indi&s;&s;oluble ties of friend&s;hip. When Mr. Armenius arrived at home, how great was his &s;urpri&s;e and emotion to find that a beloved wife was &s;natched from him by the arms of death&mdash;the &s;troke he deeply felt; he now, in the contemplation of Elvira, an only daughter, derived his greate&s;t happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sarina, the beautiful &s;eat of Colonel Arme|nius, was &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing eminence, be|neath which flowed a &s;pacious water: nature and art both combined to render it truly de|lightful. Here the romantic mind could in|dulge its imaginary plea&s;ures; it might retire with its roving fancy to &s;ome &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot, where nought is found to di&s;turb its medita|tion. Here the &s;preading tree afforded a cool retreat, covered with thick and verdant foliage; the murmur of the running &s;tream excited to
<PB N="173" REF="028973_0179_0FDDC897CF7A7A88">
reflection, and to a certain degree of pen&s;ive|ne&s;s, which lulled the mind to &s;oft repo&s;e. Here also the temperate and philo&s;ophic fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d an abode &s;uitable to all their wi&s;hes. This was the place where Elvira had &s;pent many happy years, and where a mother and a governe&s;s in|culcated in her tender mind the principles of virtue, and gave her all the in&s;truction and ac|compli&s;hments which di&s;tingui&s;h the improved female.&mdash;Mr. Tollard, according to the Colo|nel's invitation, took here his re&s;idence, and contributed much to the &s;ociability and happi|ne&s;s of the place. He was &s;en&s;ible, mild, open and generous; his per&s;on much re&s;embled Armenius's, but his face did not &s;o much cha|racterize the &s;oldier, being more mild and pla|cid: he was of a noble and re&s;pectable family, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a large fortune, and had no near relation living except a &s;i&s;ter, who &s;oon pur|po&s;ed to &s;pend &s;ome time at Sarina, and to be|come the companion of Elvira. The gay Adeline (which was her name) had hitherto re|&s;ided at London, with an old aunt: &s;he had often vi&s;ited Elvira at Sarina, and was a lively, hand&s;ome girl, nearly of the &s;ame age with El|vira.
<PB N="174" REF="028973_0180_0FDDC8D29A7FB4E8">
The return of Mr. Armenius had now &s;pread abroad, and many came to pay their congratulations: among the number was a Mr. Harmer, a di&s;tant relation of the Colonel's, who introduced to him an only &s;on whom he had brought with him. This young gentle|man, who claims a &s;hare in our tale, was re|markable for external beauty: he was about nineteen years of age, tall, and beautifully &s;haped: his face corre&s;ponded with his per&s;on; his fine blue eye &s;parkled vivacity and enticed the beholder; but alas! why have we to &s;ay, that his beauty, like that of a Paris, covered a deceitful, cruel, and treacherous heart? he was di&s;&s;ipated and debauched. This adds &s;trength to an ob&s;ervation made by experience, that re|markable beauty is &s;eldom accompanied with virtue. The top is lifted from the poli&s;hed and plated coffin, and lo! a loath&s;ome corp&s;e ap|pears. He concealed the blackne&s;s of his heart from his friends by di&s;&s;imulation; but not|with&s;tanding he had been detected in many no|torious and villainous acts, yet his beauty, join|ed with an engaging addre&s;s, made him the ob|ject of admiration. Let the ob&s;ervation
<PB N="175" REF="028973_0181_0FDDC899950A5A40">
made concerning beauty, not tend to injure, in any degree, the character of our heroine, who, I have before &s;aid, was remarkable for beauty, for there are exceptions from every general rule; and not only this, but I make di&s;tinctions between beauties; and that which Elvira po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed experience could draw no &s;uch remark from. Elvira's did not &s;o much con&s;i&s;t in the beauty and &s;ymmetry of the features, as in a cer|tain divine expre&s;&s;ion which animated her &s;e|rene countenance. A Cleopatra's beauty is the rich and beautiful tulip, which erects its orna|mented head, and excites the admiration of every beholder, far and near. Elvira's, the mo|de&s;t blu&s;hing ro&s;e, who&s;e beauties the near ob|&s;erver, and one acquainted with its excellence only perceives. Such was young Charles Har|mer, a dangerous vi&s;itor at Sarina, e&s;pecially when an enchanting creature like Elvira dwel|led there, who knew no guile and no deceit. When this young gentleman was introduced by the Colonel to his daughter, no wonder that the &s;alutation of &s;uch a per&s;on &s;hould tinge her face with a blu&s;h, and that &s;uch a per&s;on &s;hould prepo&s;&s;e&s;s her in his favour. This prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="176" REF="028973_0182_0FDD5F9ADC6C2750">
was augmented when &s;he li&s;tened to his lively conver&s;ation, and when &s;he ob&s;erved that he now paid to her the mo&s;t of his attention. He addre&s;&s;ed her with mild and gentle accents; congratulated her on the arrival of her father, and mourned with her the lo&s;s of a mother. El|vira returned &s;uitable and mode&s;t an&s;wers, and &s;urprized him with an under&s;tanding equal to her beauty. The hours had pa&s;&s;ed unperceiv|ed by Sarina's inhabitants, engaged in &s;weet in|tercour&s;e; and evening was drawing a veil over the face of the &s;un, when young Charles propo&s;ed a walk, which was accepted by Elvira. When they were retiring the Colonel ca&s;t a plea&s;ing &s;mile on his lovely daughter, which Elvira returned while the ro&s;e &s;uffu&s;ed it&s;elf over her face.</P>
<P>They now directed their &s;teps towards the water's &s;ide; and while they enjoyed each others conver&s;ation, the calmne&s;s and beauty of the &s;cene contributed to augment their plea|&s;ure. Young Harmer, in the language of ad|miration expre&s;&s;ed the beauty of the evening, and of the place. Says he, the evening is the emblem of calmne&s;s and &s;erenity; all that in the
<PB N="177" REF="028973_0183_0FDDC89D6F5B8130">
day contributed to di&s;turb meditation, is hu&s;hed in quietne&s;s and repo&s;e. It is now that gloomy &s;orrow leaves her di&s;contented man&s;ion, and walks abroad to &s;urvey the beauties of Nature, the temporary &s;oother of her woes. He then, in expre&s;&s;ing the beauty of the place, ob&s;erved, that it was only &s;uitable for &s;uch inhabitants, and &s;ufficient to &s;ooth the Colonel's former &s;uf|ferings. The city was the &s;eat of Elvira's en|quiries, and &s;he was informed in every parti|cular. When &s;he enquired concerning the a&s;|&s;emblies, O! &s;ays he, they are indeed truly de|lightful; there is no &s;uch &s;ociability and cheer|fulne&s;s in any place: and what a delightful and u&s;eful accompli&s;hment dancing is! it bani&s;hes all gloomy ideas from the mind, and gives ac|tivity and &s;prightline&s;s to the body. Elvira on|ly replied, that &s;he was glad to &s;ee &s;o powerful an advocate e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of an amu&s;ement &s;he was very fond of. He then told her that the la&s;t a&s;&s;embly he vi&s;ited, he was very much &s;truck with the beauty of a young lady, who&s;e hand he had the favour of to walk a minuet; and that when on the floor her beauty attracted the attention of the whole company, and much,
<PB N="178" REF="028973_0184_0FDDC8D9D7C5C8F0">
that of his own: that when he had handed her to a &s;eat he was greatly entertained with her agreeable and lively conver&s;ation. She a&s;ked him if he had any acquaintance with Mi&s;s El|vira Armenius; and when he an&s;wered in the ne|gative, &s;he related a great many pretty things con|cerning her. Upon enquiry, he found her to be a Mi&s;s Adeline Tollard, the expected heire&s;s of a great fortune. Elvira, plea&s;ed with this rela|tion, returned, that Mi&s;s Adeline was her inti|mate friend, and that &s;he could not &s;ufficiently thank her for propagating reports concerning her &s;uppo&s;ed excellence; but that &s;he would not attempt her excellencies, as they were too well e&s;tabli&s;hed, and needed no eulogium. The in&s;inuating Harmer, &s;miling, &s;aid, that Mi&s;s Adeline, among her many virtues, mu&s;t have mingled confidence and &s;elf-conceit to attempt Mi&s;s Elvira's; but that friend&s;hip had engaged her in the cau&s;e, although unequal to the arduous ta&s;k. Elvira, blu&s;hing, told him to remember that friend&s;hip never puts vice in the &s;cales to preponderate with virtue, and is therefore in|capable to draw any true or ju&s;t character.</P>
<P>They now approached a little hill which gradually aro&s;e from the water, who&s;e verdant
<PB N="179" REF="028973_0185_0FDDC89ED8688900">
top &s;eemed to invite an agreeable &s;eat. When they had a&s;cended it, what was Harmer's &s;ur|pri&s;e, when he ob&s;erved the beauty and regula|rity of the gra&s;s, the &s;preading foilage of the trees which &s;urrounded it, and the different flowers exhaling the mo&s;t agreeable odour.&mdash;The common hill was &s;uddenly and unexpectedly changed into an Helicon or Parna&s;&s;us. Surely (cries he) nature never, entirely of her&s;elf, formed this delightful &s;pot, but art mu&s;t al&s;o have lent her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;Elvira, &s;miling, told him, that it was a &s;elected place of her's, &s;acred to reflection and contemplation; that &s;he often in the evening re&s;orted hither, to pay her vow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to tho&s;e venerable gods. Here (&s;ays &s;he) I have often pa&s;&s;ed many an agreeable hour with my dear Adeline, who&s;e company made every thing a&s;&s;ume a new charm. Then friend&s;hip directed our di&s;cour&s;es, and we never thought or dreamt of &s;orrow. Sometimes Adeline would here tune her lute, and the echo would re&s;ound to the charming melody. O then the evening &s;eemed too much in ha&s;te to interrupt our joys&mdash;
<Q><L>"Friend&s;hip! my&s;terious cement of the &s;oul!</L>
<L>Sweetner of life! and &s;older of &s;ociety!</L>

I owe thee much. Thou ha&s;t de&s;erved from me</L>
<L>Far, far beyond what I can ever pray,</L>
<L>Oft have I prov'd the labours of thy love,</L>
<L>And the warm efforts of the gentle heart</L>
<L>Anxious to plea&s;e.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>Here al&s;o, I have often &s;ent invocations to the mu&s;es, but alas! without effect. O! cries Harmer, could the mu&s;e ever reject &s;uch a &s;ui|tor, or refu&s;e a vi&s;it to &s;uch a place? No, &s;ays Elvira; &s;he di&s;dains not the place; but it is the humble and ob&s;cure mind; for &s;he at|tends the enlightened and intelligent even in a wretched garret. Let it then be my duty, when females, like Cali&s;ta, &s;ing in gentle lays, to li&s;ten and improve, until I catch the note. Harmer replied; this, Mi&s;s Elvira, is only the report of an individual, whom mode&s;ty hinders from &s;peaking the contrary; but where is a &s;econd to confirm it? I am certain none can be found, and therefore you mu&s;t pardon me if I &s;tand unconvinced.</P>
<P>They de&s;cended the hill and approached the hou&s;e, as the &s;hades of evening were quickly de|clining.&mdash;When Elvira retired to her chamber, and was left alone to her meditation, the capti|vating
<PB N="181" REF="028973_0187_0FDDC8A2DAB324E0">
Harmer employed the mo&s;t of her thoughts: they repre&s;ented him as beautiful and agreeable, and a youth of almo&s;t every perfec|tion; as polite, but e&s;pecially &s;o to her&s;elf. In &s;hort, &s;he felt &s;omething which &s;he could not expre&s;s, and which her youthful mind had ne|ver felt before: what this was, experience be&s;t can tell, and inexperience &s;huns the dangerous ta&s;k.&mdash;Elvira no le&s;s commanded the attention of young Harmer: &s;he in&s;pired him with more reverence and honourable intentions than any female he had &s;een: &s;he impre&s;&s;ed on his mind a great idea of her under&s;tanding and beauty, and made him con&s;ider her as a prize well worth obtaining, and that too much pains could not be taken in an&s;wering this end. As he was to return home with his father next morn|ing, he was already planning the time of his re|turn. The&s;e were their plea&s;ing meditations, until &s;leep di&s;per&s;ed con&s;cious ideas, and pre|&s;ented illu&s;ive ones; until the anticipating and reflecting mind &s;unk in repo&s;e: for plea&s;ure cannot, like &s;orrow, entirely bani&s;h her in|fluence.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="028973_0188_0FDDC8DE9E7028F8">
The next morning after breakfa&s;t the hor&s;es were prepared for their departure. At ta|king leave, the Colonel pre&s;&s;ed them often to vi&s;it their friends at Sarina. Young Harmer, following the example of his father, approached Elvira, and imprinted a ki&s;s on her cherry lips; &s;he blu&s;hing wi&s;hed them a plea&s;ant journey: they then mounted their hor&s;es and rode off. Elvira pur&s;ued them with her eyes until out of &s;ight, and then retired into the hou&s;e, &s;ecretly re|gretting the departure of young Harmer: but &s;hort was her regret, for Harmer &s;oon return|ed, and continued frequently his vi&s;its at Sari|na: he became the open &s;uitor of Elvira, and affection imperceptibly &s;tole on her heart, while ignorant of the real character of her treacherous lover.</P>
<P>When guarded by the mo&s;t accurate hypocri|&s;y, how could an un&s;u&s;picious female penetrate into the real character of a lover, e&s;pecially when that hypocri&s;y is connected with beauty, and manners the mo&s;t refined and engaging? But yet often truth prevails and &s;hews the dangerous haunts of vice, and gives the virtuous mind a chance to flee from this dangerous companion.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="028973_0189_0FDD5F9C47091620">
But to return&mdash;the months had now flown away in &s;peedy &s;ucce&s;&s;ion on the wings of plea|&s;ure, and Adeline Tollard had not arrived ac|cording to expectation; the warm brea&s;t of friend&s;hip mu&s;t therefore feel anxious, and ne|ce&s;&s;arily enquire the cau&s;e&mdash;Elvira therefore di&s;|patched a letter enquiring this, and informing her, that &s;he now mourned for her long ab&s;ent friend, and that, expecting her, &s;he had im|proved their little &s;eat, which would &s;end forth its blo&s;&s;oms in vain: that &s;he had a great many things to tell and a&s;k her.

"Being one afternoon, in a large company where the conver&s;ation happened to turn upon your father's arrival, as &s;oon as the name of Co|lonel Armenius was mentioned, a young officer who &s;at attentive to the di&s;cour&s;e in one corner of the room, &s;tarted up and repeated aloud the name with all the ge&s;tures of a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;urpri&s;e: but &s;oon after recollecting his &s;itu|ation, he gracefully begged the company's par|don. He then drew his chair by my &s;ide, who held a principal &s;hare in the di&s;cour&s;e, and with all the eagerne&s;s of an intere&s;ted friend, a&s;ked me, in a rapid but polite manner, many que&s;tions concerning the Colonel. I &s;atisfied him in the be&s;t manner I was able. After which he exclaimed, "I thought that this gallant officer fell gloriou&s;ly fighting for his country; but thanks to Providence he is yet &s;pared to be a &s;till greater ble&s;&s;ing. Ah! few are the men his country can boa&s;t of his equal in military know|ledge, or in goodne&s;s of heart!" He then en|quired if he had any children.

<P>Elvira &s;howed this letter to her father, and ob&s;erved, while he was reading it, various emo|tions pre&s;ent them&s;elves in his face.

'Gratitude for the pre&s;ervation of my life&mdash;He bore a captain's commi&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame regiment which I com|manded, and had next to my&s;elf the love and e&s;teem of the &s;oldiers.

When I returned to the camp, I &s;aw a&s;to|ni&s;hment, guilt, and cowardice pictured on the wretched Freeman's vi&s;age. Dormer wi&s;hed to publi&s;h the action to the camp, but I prevented him, and told him the point of honour between Freeman and me; and that he need not fear on my account, as I was pretty expert at the &s;word. Freeman being now unable to extricate him&s;elf, mu&s;t either lo&s;e altogether the character of a &s;oldier, or meet me: &s;uffice it to &s;ay that he did, and that treachery received its di&s;mal re|ward from the arm of injured innocence.

Every day the inhabitants of Sarina looked for the arrival of Dormer, but he di&s;appointed all their expectations. The colonel feared he had forgotten his old commander, or that &s;ome|thing extraordinary had happened. Elvira, in the company of Harmer, felt no way anxious for his arrival, and was blind to the de&s;cription of her friend and father: but Harmer dreaded his coming, not only on Elvira's account, but for rea&s;ons yet unknown. One evening when they were all &s;itting before the door, a young man on hor&s;eback appeared: when he approach|ed nearer, they di&s;cerned by his dre&s;s that he was an officer; as &s;oon as he had come up he threw him&s;elf from his hor&s;e and enquired for Mr. Armenius; the colonel immediately aro&s;e, and they were in&s;tantly in each other's arms. After this warm embrace was over, Dormer was introduced to the other two; they all then retired into the hou&s;e: the colonel fixed his eyes on his young friend, and addre&s;&s;ed him in the warm language which friend&s;hip dictates; he ob&s;erved a gloomy melancholy cloud his manly features, and that his former vivacity and &s;prightline&s;s were flown; and by Mi&s;s Adeline's

for the return of the evening; and as &s;oon as it appeared, they directed their &s;teps towards the little hill. When they had come to the foot of it, they walked &s;oftly up it, for fear of alarm|ing the &s;tranger, if &s;he was already there. When they had reached the top, the fir&s;t object that &s;truck their eyes was the beautiful I&s;abella, &s;itting with her back reclined again&s;t a tree, with hands cla&s;ped and eyes directed towards Heaven; her beautiful hair hung loo&s;e about her neck; her pale and &s;nowy vi&s;age, and tears which &s;lowly flowed, be&s;poke the fair daughter of affliction: The name of Harmer had just died on her lips, when &s;he ca&s;t down her lan|gui&s;hing eyes and beheld her two fair vi&s;itants: &s;he &s;tarted and uttered a cry; but soon after re|covering her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aid in wild accents, "What chance has directed here two beautiful young ladies? flee from the &s;eat of mi&s;ery and ignominy." "Pardon," &s;ays Elvira interrupt|ing her, "this intru&s;ion; we la&s;t evening found out that here an unknown maid mourned her mi&s;ery, "without an ear to hear, or eye to pi|ty."

Pardon me for not men|tioning names; notwith&s;tanding I know well your &s;ecrecy." Elvira heard the name which died on I&s;abella's lips when &s;he fir&s;t per|ceived them: her untried fortitude was unable to bear the &s;evere trial; thus to &s;ee the unhappy &s;ituation of an amiable female, and to find that Harmer, the man whom &s;he adored, had been the cau&s;e of it; &s;he would have fallen had not her friend &s;upported her. I&s;abella &s;aw her agi|tation, and knew that &s;omething el&s;e be&s;ide di&s;tre&s;s on her account mu&s;t be the cau&s;e. When Elvira recovered &s;ufficiently, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed to I&s;abella the whole affair concerning her&s;elf and Harmer, and that &s;he would now endeavour to bani&s;h him from her affections, and to receive (more agreeably to her father's inclinations) the

amiable Dormer. The name, inadvertently expre&s;&s;ed, had &s;uch an effect upon I&s;abella, that it immediately di&s;covered her to be the lo&s;t &s;i&s;ter. The letter which her brother had writ|ten was then related to her, and &s;he was made acquainted with all that Elvira knew concerning the family. When they parted they agreed often to meet on the little hill.</P>
<P>When Elvira and Adeline returned home, the fir&s;t per&s;on they &s;aw was Harmer, who had ju&s;t come: he aro&s;e with his u&s;ual engaging air to &s;alute them, but was coldly received. Before he could have an opportunity to enquire the cau&s;e, the young ladies retired to their chamber, where Elvira pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;tle&s;s night. The next morning Harmer endeavoured to find Elvira alone: he at la&s;t obtained his wi&s;h, and addre&s;|&s;ing her in his u&s;ual mild and enticing accent, &s;aid, "My amiable Elvira, I hope I have not in any manner injured you; if I have, do not &s;o &s;everely puni&s;h a &s;light fault." Elvira re|plied, "Perhaps, Sir, you have not injured me, but I wi&s;h to have no connection with perfidy; I have once, I own, had a partiality for you, but this I now bani&s;h from my brea&s;t: as my &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itor,

The evening at length ar|rived; the three young ladies had long been on the hill expecting Harmer's coming.

He then led her down, the hill, at the foot of which was a chaise, and after having bid Elvira and Adeline <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> affectionate farewell, rode off. When the

A refined &s;en&s;ibility which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed made him &s;eek for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and to delight to &s;oothe the brea&s;t of affliction by his affability and charity.

His &s;eat was large and beautifully &s;ituated; his youth|ful mind was not yet inclined to dome&s;tic af|fairs, he therefore intru&s;ted them to an old and faithful &s;teward who had long been attached to the hou&s;e.

As Augu&s;tus and his &s;i&s;ter Loui&s;a were re|turning from a rural excur&s;ion, they were much delighted with the beauty and &s;ituation of a little cot which &s;tood on their property; they would have advanced unto it, but the even|ing being far &s;pent prevented them.</P>
<P>Some time after as Augu&s;tus was walking out unaccompanied in the evening, he directed his &s;teps towards this cot which he formerly &s;o much admired, and when he had come up to it he leaned on the fence with which it was in|clo&s;ed; he ca&s;t his eyes around, and beheld with admiration and plea&s;ure the neatne&s;s of the hou&s;e, as well as the improvements which &s;ur|rounded it; but a &s;till more beautiful object attracted his attention, he beheld a beautiful young female gracefully reclined beneath a tree; her &s;ide face was turned towards him, and he indulged himself with the plea&s;ing feeling that he fea&s;ted not at the expence of de|licacy. He ob&s;erved by her pale countenance, on which he could perceive that the rose for|merly bloomed, that &s;ome &s;ecret unea&s;iness &s;at heavy on her heart; &s;he was &s;troaking the neck

of a little dog which fawned at her feet: &s;he was cloathed in the &s;imple weeds of ru&s;ticity, but even at her fir&s;t appearance the idea aro&s;e in Augu&s;tus's mind, that &s;o much beauty could not be born in &s;o low a &s;phere. Augu&s;tus &s;ilently retired behind &s;ome trees for fear that this beautiful &s;tranger &s;hould perceive him. He had not been long there before &s;he arose, ca&s;t her expre&s;&s;ive black eyes around, and walked towards the door of the cot, calling her little dog, in a voice which equalled the &s;weete&s;t mu&s;ic. Her graceful movement and elegantly propor|tioned per&s;on did not then e&s;cape the tran&s;port|ed attention of Augu&s;tus. From her appearance he judged her to be about &s;ixteen years of age. After &s;he had di&s;appeared, Augu&s;tus ro&s;e from his place of concealment, and directed his &s;teps to|wards home reflecting on the beauty of this fair cottager, and planning &s;ome &s;cheme to become acquainted with her. His imagination from &s;uch an out&s;ide appearance, already painted the amia|ble and cultivated mind, while his &s;u&s;picion that &s;he was not the daughter of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the cot, was greatly increa&s;ed. When he returned home, his fir&s;t enquiry was for his old &s;teward; he enquired of him who it was that lived in the

He therefore di&s;patched a &s;ervant next morning with a letter, inviting him to his hou&s;e in the evening, the &s;ervant returned with an an&s;wer, that Mr. Ambern would do him&s;elf the honour of waiting on him, and when a&s;ked by Augu&s;tus who he had &s;een, O, cries he, be&s;ides the man and his wife, I &s;aw a most beautiful young lady, who appeared about the age of Mi&s;s Loui&s;a, sitting in the corner with her eyes &s;wimming in tears, and a beautiful picture tied by a ribbon hung from her neck, I think it mu&s;t &s;urely be that of &s;ome lover. This &s;imple &s;peech of the &s;ervant made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of Augu&s;tus, as convinced him that his brea&s;t was in this in&s;tance &s;u&s;ceptible to the charms of beauty, as well as to the feelings of &s;ympathy and &s;orrow. In &s;hort, let it be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the charms of this lovely maid had &s;mitten the &s;u&s;ceptible brea&s;t of Augu&s;tus. When the evening arrived, and Augu&s;tus was alone in his chamber, a rap was heard at the door, and a &s;ervant directly led in Mr. Ambern. Augu&s;|tus aro&s;e to receive him, and after he had wel|comed him to his hou&s;e, they &s;at down &s;ociably

together. Although his manners were not what is commonly termed graceful, they were &s;imple and ea&s;y, free from all affectation. Au|gu&s;tus was informed by him, that he had been an officer in the American army; that he had been in &s;everal engagements, in one of which he re|ceived a wound. Augu&s;tus's young mind, which glowed with patrioti&s;m, now burned with re|doubled friend&s;hip towards him. He enquired how many children he had, to which, after a little he&s;itation, he replied only one. He was about to que&s;tion him concerning the young la|dy which he meant to &s;ay his &s;ervant had &s;een there; when Mr. Ambern looking at him with a &s;mile, cried, I know it is in vain, my young friend, to hide from you what you allude to, and although reque&s;ted to &s;ecrecy, I will inform you of what little I know, not only from a mo|tive to &s;atisfy you, but that you being ac|quainted with the circum&s;tances, may be in &s;ome degree u&s;eful. Augu&s;tus replied, that there needed not any other plea but di&s;tre&s;s to engage his protection; but e&s;pecially, in favour of one arrayed in &s;uch charms, his intere&s;tedne&s;s mu&s;t be greatly increa&s;ed, for he now informed

Mr. Ambern he had been an eye witne&s;s of them. Mr. Ambern replied, you are yet ac|quainted with but half her charms, for equal to her beauty is the cultivation of her mind; her &s;weet enticing manners, her engaging conver|&s;ation, have &s;o won upon the affections of my wife and my&s;elf, that we love her almo&s;t equal|ly with our &s;on. We feel almo&s;t equally with her|&s;elf for the di&s;tre&s;s under which &s;he appears to labour. She has a little in&s;trument through which &s;he breathes the &s;orrows of her &s;oul in &s;uch melancholy &s;trains as to often draw tears from our eyes. But, my friend, I will pa&s;s from this, to tell you what little I know concerning this amiable young lady. About a week pa&s;t, late in the evening as we &s;at at tea, we heard a carriage &s;top, and &s;oon after a knocking at the door, when opening it, a young gentleman of genteel appearance, and noble countenance, led in this young female; they both appeared to be in di&s;tre&s;s; I invited them to &s;it down, which they immediately did; we all &s;at for &s;ome time in profound &s;ilence, at la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he young gentleman aro&s;e, and in the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t melancholy

accents, de&s;ired me to walk a little way in the field with him. I immediately complied, leav|ing the young lady with my wife; we had not proceeded far when he thus addre&s;&s;ed me&mdash;you will, no doubt, wonder to &s;ee two per&s;ons thus enter your hou&s;e with whom you have not the lea&s;t acquaintance; but it will be &s;ufficient to inform you that it is di&s;tre&s;s which has thus obliged us abruptly to claim an entrance; and at the door of the indu&s;trious and hone&s;t hu&s;|bandman, mi&s;ery is &s;eldom refu&s;ed admittance. I interrupted him with a&s;&s;urances of the suffici|ency of his apology, and expre&s;&s;ed, in &s;incere terms, my intere&s;t in his &s;orrows; that if I could in any way &s;erve him, it would give me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure. With tears of joy and gratitude he acknowledged my kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality: He told me, I need not harbour the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of their di&s;hone&s;ty, for it was virtue that bade them fly hither. But (conti|nued he) you mu&s;t pardon me for not relating the cau&s;e of our appearance here, you &s;hall hear it at &s;ome future time; the few minutes which circum&s;tances allow me to &s;tay here will not permit me: But let me now call your attention
<PB N="210" REF="028973_0216_0FDDC98690BBC0A0">
to the trouble which I &s;olicit from you&mdash;This lovely female which I have brought under your roof, I be&s;eech you to protect; let her remain with you as one of your family; be a kind and indulgent parent to her; let it remain a &s;ecret that &s;he is here; endeavor to &s;oothe her in her affliction, but do not endeavor to draw the cau&s;e of it from her, as it will heighten it&mdash;excu&s;e, my protector, the &s;hortne&s;s and abruptne&s;s of my expre&s;&s;ions, as ha&s;te will allow me no others. We then turned towards the hou&s;e; when the young gentleman entered it, and, while the tears trickled down his cheeks, he exclaimed, now, my Aurelia, having found a faithful guardian for you, &s;uffer me to bid you farewell: It &s;hall not be long before I &s;hall return to re&s;tore you to joy and to your home. The lovely Aurelia &s;prang from her chair, and encircled his neck with her &s;nowy arms, exclaiming, in accents almo&s;t inarticulate, return &s;oon my Ferdinand, my deare&s;t &mdash;. The la&s;t word here I was unable to di&s;tingui&s;h. Ferdinand, after having eembraced her, and, with all the politene&s;s of afflicted gratitude, bid us farewell, walked ha&s;|tily from the door. He immediately &s;prang

in his carriage, dropping his pur&s;e, which I had formerly refu&s;ed. I returned to the hou&s;e, much touched by the genero&s;ity and di&s;tre&s;&s; of the youth. Aurelia the next morning &s;eemed to have much recovered her &s;pirits&mdash;to prevent di&s;covery, &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in tho&s;e garments in which you have &s;een her. This is all, my dear young gentleman, that I know about the beautiful Aurelia. After much other conver|&s;ation, chiefly concerning the &s;ame &s;ubject, Mr. Ambern returned home. When Augu&s;tus was left alone, his thoughts naturally remained with the object of his late conver&s;ation: his curio&s;i|ty, in&s;tead of being dimini&s;hed, was rather in|crea&s;ed. The behavior of Ferdinand, the young gentleman who accompanied her, and the pic|ture which the &s;ervant had &s;een about Aurelia's neck, convinced him that he was her lover. The pain which the&s;e reflections gave, told him the &s;tate of his heart&mdash;He was re&s;olved to guard him&s;elf again&s;t her charms&mdash;<HI>Sed omnia vincit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mor.</HI></P>
<P>One evening, which was very calm and beautiful, when &s;ilence waved her gentle hand, and hu&s;hed the world in quiet and repo&s;e, when

the mind is filled with thoughts congenial to the &s;cene, Augu&s;tus took up his flute, upon which he was a great proficient, and directed his &s;teps towards a little grove, which grew a &s;mall di&s;|tance behind the hou&s;e of Mr. Ambern. Au|relia was the &s;ubject of his meditation. When he came to the grove, he reclined him&s;elf be|neath a tree, and, after having remained for &s;ome time in &s;ilence, he applied his mouth to hi&s; flute, and through it breathed forth &s;uch harmonious &s;trains as corre&s;ponded with his feelings: The melody, in &s;weete&s;t vibrations, floated on the air, and the hills were re&s;pon&s;ive to the trem|bling notes&mdash;The feathered &s;ong&s;ters forgot their &s;ong, and li&s;tened in attentive &s;ilence&mdash;Nor were the&s;e the only li&s;teners&mdash;This grove was often the re&s;ort of Aurelia&mdash;The beauty of the pre&s;ent evening had invited her thither, and &s;he was now li&s;tening in a little place &s;ur|rounded by bu&s;hes, a &s;ilent hearer and &s;pectator of Augu&s;tus&mdash;She, un&s;een, now perceived him, as he formerly did her&mdash;She was charmed with the beauty of the mu&s;ic, which was al&s;o conge|nial to her feelings&mdash;but the manly appearance of Augu&s;tus claimed her attention more than
<PB N="213" REF="028973_0219_0FDDC90A761D8400">
his &s;trains&mdash;While thus Augu&s;tus indulged his feelings, his &s;i&s;ter Loui&s;a, who had ob&s;erved him walk towards the grove, and who deter|mined to follow him, now came up, and, laughing, caught hold of his flute, and &s;aid, Why, Augu&s;tus, what is the matter with you&mdash;what makes you &s;o grave and &s;erious of late, that you mu&s;t run into the woods to play &s;uch dole&s;ome ditties?&mdash;Augu&s;tus, &s;miling, with|out making any reply, took his &s;i&s;ter by the hand, and they directed their &s;teps home.&mdash;Aurelia, when &s;he returned to the cot, did not relate what &s;he had &s;een&mdash;From the appearance of Augu&s;tus, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he was a young gen|tleman of fortune, and that &s;ome &s;ecret unea&s;i|ne&s;s dwelled within his brea&s;t&mdash;Her heart ac|knowledged the charms of his mu&s;ic, and of him&s;elf.

<PB N="214" REF="028973_0220_0FDDC98CE34E6420">
perceived it by his countenance&mdash;It was, however, of &s;hort duration, for he had &s;et but a few minutes, when Aurelia entered, with her hat on, ju&s;t returned from a walk&mdash;She did not perceive Augu&s;tus, who had ari&s;en at her en|trance, until &s;he had advanced a few &s;teps in the room; but directly after, her eyes meeting his, a crim&s;on blu&s;h diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over both their countenances&mdash;Aurelia immediately re|collected the young gentleman &s;he had &s;een in the grove, who&s;e mu&s;ic had &s;o greatly enter|tained her. Mr. Ambern then introduced them to each other&mdash;a certain embarra&s;&s;ment was vi&s;ible in Aurelia&mdash;After they had &s;et down, Augu&s;tus, with his u&s;ual engaging demeanor, endeavored to enter into conver&s;ation, nor were his attempts un&s;ucce&s;sful, and the common em|barra&s;&s;ment which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between &s;trangers was &s;oon removed&mdash;He could not behold, but with admiration and emotion, her beauty, which was heightened by the exerci&s;e &s;he had been taking&mdash;Without the aid of ornament, and richne&s;s of dre&s;s, &s;he now appeared in her own charms&mdash;her beautiful eyes beamed &s;weetne&s;s and love&mdash;her flowing locks hung graceful on

her back, unadorned by the hand of art&mdash;She had not the fragrance of co&s;metic perfume, but the flowers of the garden bloomed on her bo&s;om. Augu&s;tus was equally plea&s;ed with her conver|&s;ation, and he found, that his imagination had not painted her in too high colours.</P>
<P>He pa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the evening in her company, and was &s;orry to &s;ee it &s;o rapidly glide away. At his departure, he informed Aurelia, that he had a &s;i&s;ter nearly of the &s;ame age with her&s;elf, who would be happy to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch an invaluable acquaintance. Aurelia thanked him for his po|litene&s;s, and expre&s;&s;ed the happine&s;s &s;he &s;hould experience from a friend. When Augu&s;tus returned home, his mind was almo&s;t wholly oc|cupied with Aurelia&mdash;His &s;i&s;ter Loui&s;a jocu|larly que&s;tioned him concerning where he had been&mdash;He, without di&s;gui&s;e, informed her of the conver&s;ation at the cot, and of the liberty he had taken in offering her friend&s;hip to Au|relia. Loui&s;a rejoiced in this opportunity of getting acquainted with her&mdash;Her curio&s;ity had become so greatly excited, that &s;he re&s;olved the very next day to vi&s;it her&mdash;She did &s;o, and &s;he
<PB N="216" REF="028973_0222_0FDDC98E09641D20">
and Aurelia became intimates at the very fir&s;t meeting&mdash;This intimacy gradually increa&s;ed; Aurelia often vi&s;ited Augu&s;tus's feat, him&s;elf and his &s;i&s;ter often at the cot. Augu&s;tus now informed Aurelia, where he had fir&s;t &s;een her, but never ventured to utter a &s;yllable re&s;pecting her &s;ituation. She, in return, informed Au|gu&s;tus where &s;he had fir&s;t &s;een him, and how much &s;he had been entertained with his flute.</P>
<P>While thus the intimacy and pa&s;&s;ion of Au|gu&s;tus were daily increa&s;ing, an event happen|ed, which draws my tale to a &s;peedy conclu|&s;ion:&mdash;</P>
<P>One evening Augu&s;tus was on a vi&s;it to the cot; when he had approached within view of it, he perceived a carriage &s;tanding before the door; his curio&s;ity was greatly excited, to know to whom it belonged. He &s;oftly entered the hou&s;e, but what was his &s;urprize, when the fir&s;t object that &s;truck his eyes, was a young gentleman with Aurelia cla&s;ped in his arms&mdash;His heart throbbed, his pul&s;e beat quick, the thought immediately occurred, that he was to have his beloved Aurelia &s;natched from him forever, by a &s;ucce&s;sful lover. The young gen|tleman
<PB N="217" REF="028973_0223_0FDDC90F73E62200">
who held Aurelia, did not perceive Au|gu&s;tus at his fir&s;t entrance, but upon her whi&s;pering to him, he turned round. They in&s;tantly caught each other's eye, &s;tood for a moment gazing on each other, then flow into each other's arms, while Augu&s;tus exclaimed, O my Ferdinand, is it you, my former deare&s;t friend and cla&s;smate? After this warm em|brace, Augu&s;tus's fir&s;t inquiry to Ferdinand was, why he had come hither&punc;&mdash;Ah! my dear Au|gu&s;tus (he cried) I have come on a very plea&s;ing emba&s;&s;y; to recall home an only and beloved &s;i&s;ter, who has fled here for protection from a father who was going to force her into marri|age with one whom &s;he dete&s;ted. As &s;oon as Ferdinand pronounced the name of &s;i&s;ter, Au|gu&s;tus was unable to contain himself&mdash;he &s;prang forward towards Aurelia, and pre&s;&s;ed her ro&s;y cheek to his&mdash;&s;he did not receive him with a frown, but a blu&s;h and a &s;mile. Here the au|thor breaks off his narrative, a&s;&s;uring tho&s;e who have honored his little tale with their peru&s;al, that the conclu&s;ion which they will be naturally led to draw, will be the true and right one; &s;uch an one as the author, if he had felt him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed, would have drawn him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>GAUL, the &s;on of Morni, attended Lath|mon into his own country, where he was kind|ly entertained by Nuath, the father of Lath|mon, and fell in love with his daughter Oithona. The lady was no le&s;s enamoured of Gaul, and a day was fixed for their marriage. In the mean time, Fingal, preparing for an expedition, &s;ent for Gaul. He obeyed and went; but pro|mi&s;ed Oithona to return if he &s;urvived the war, by a certain day. Lathmon too was obliged to at|tend his father Nuath in his wars; and Oitho|na was left alone at Dunlathmon, the &s;eat of the family. Dunromath, Lord of Cuthal, taking advantage of the ab&s;ence of her friends, came, and carried off by force, Oithona, who had formerly rejected his love, into Tromathon, where he concealed her in a cave.&mdash;Gaul returned on the day appointed; heard of the rape, and &s;ailed to Tromathon, to re|venge him&s;elf on Dunromath. When he land|ed, he found Oithona di&s;con&s;olate, and re&s;olved not to &s;urvive the lo&s;s of her honour. She told him the &s;tory of her mi&s;fortunes, and &s;he had &s;carce ended, when Dunromath with his fol|lowers

appeared at the other end of the i&s;land. Gaul prepared to attack him, recommending to Oithona to retire until the battle was over. She &s;eemingly obeyed; but &s;ecretly armed her&s;elf, ru&s;hed in the thicke&s;t of the battle, and was mortally wounded. Gaul having put to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ight and pur&s;ued the enemy, was returning towards the cave to look for Oithona, when he found her l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aning on the rocks ju&s;t expiring. He mourned over her, rai&s;ed her tomb, and return|ed to Morven. The poem opens with Gaul's return to Dunlathmon at the time appointed, af|ter the rape of Oithona.</P>

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>CUTHULLIN, after the arms of Fingal had expelled Swaran from Ireland, continued to manage the affairs of that kingdom, as the guardian of Cormac the young King. In the third year of Cuthullin's admini&s;tration, Tor|lath, the &s;on of Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ela, rebelled in Connaught; and advanced to Temora to dethrone Cormac. Cuthullin marched again&s;t him, came up with him at the lake of Lego, and totally defeated his forces. Torlath fell in the battle by Cu|thullin's hand; but as he too eagerly pre&s;&s;ed on the enemy, he was mortally wounded. The affairs of Cormac, though for &s;ome time &s;up|ported by Nathos as mentioned in another poem, fell in confu&s;ion at the death of Cuthul|lin. Cormac him&s;elf was &s;lain by the rebel Cairbar.</P>

Bragela the daughter of Sorglan, and pa&s;&s;ing over into Ireland, lived for &s;ome time with Cor|mal, grand&s;on to the king of Ul&s;ter. His wi&s;dom and valour in a &s;hort time gained him &s;uch re|putation, that in the minority of Cormac, the &s;u|preme king of Ireland, he was cho&s;en guardian to the young king, and &s;ole manager of the war again&s;t Swaran, king of Lochlin.

&s;unk in darkne&s;s and gloom. When we take a view of &s;ome of the mo&s;t celebrated heroes of Greece, we become &s;o engaged with the illu&s;|trious actions of each, that we know not which to prefer. It is natural to the mind of youth, to enquire which of the celebrated heroes of antiquity is greate&s;t. Some, captivated by the glaring actions of Alexander the Great, extoll him as the greate&s;t of terre&s;trial beings. Two, which I very much admire, and whom I think, in &s;ome re&s;pects, excell all others, are Epa|minondas and Pelopidas.</P>
<P>Epaminondas was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every qualifi|cation nece&s;&s;ary to render man truly great. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the heroic virtues of a general, and all the milder and &s;ofter virtues of a friend&mdash;He was of illu&s;trious birth, and the &s;on of Polymnis&mdash;No Theban ever equalled him in knowledge and eloquence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gilli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s's Hi&s;tory of Greece.</NOTE> Although poor, he re&s;i&s;ted the generous &s;olicitations of his friends, to deliver him from the honorable po|verty in which he was born, continuing poor from ta&s;te and choice, and ju&s;tly delighting in a &s;tate which is more favorable, e&s;pecially in a

Democratical Republic, to that freedom and independence of mind, which wi&s;dom recom|mends as the greate&s;t good. Nor was he more carele&s;s of money, than avaricious of time, which he continually dedicated to the &s;tudy of learning and philo&s;ophy, or employed in the exerci&s;e of public and private virtue: Yet, to become u&s;eful, he was not de&s;irous to be great: He not only turned his attention to the cultiva|tion of his mind, but to the acquirement of vigour and &s;trength of body: He had a martial and manly appearance, and &s;hone at once the hero and philo&s;opher. Pelopidas, the &s;on of Hippoclus, was equal with Epaminondas in his de&s;cent: From his infancy he was brought up in opulence and plenty, and obtained, when he arrived at the age of manhood, an immen&s;e e&s;tate: He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a high degree, the vir|tues, genero&s;ity and benevolence, and delight|ed to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the indigent: All his friends he made partake of his wealth, ex|cept Epaminondas, who could never be pre|vailed upon to relinqui&s;h that virtuous poverty which was &s;o very much adapted to his philo&s;o|phical di&s;po&s;ition. Pelopidas married early a noble Theban lady, and had by her many chil|dren<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch's Lives;</NOTE>;

yet, notwith&s;tanding the increa&s;e of his expences, he &s;till continued to be&s;tow large donations upon his friends; and when &s;ome per&s;on, in con&s;equence of this, told him, "That money, which he neglected, was a very ne|ce&s;&s;ary thing"&mdash;"It is very nece&s;&s;ary, replied he, for Nicodemus there"&mdash;pointing to a man of that name, who was both blind and lame.</P>
<P>The&s;e two illu&s;trious Thebans po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed di&s;|po&s;itions for all kinds of virtues: But no par|ticular virtue has rendered them more glorious and celebrated, than the friend&s;hip which &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between them, which was never broken but by the hand of death. Pelopidas preferred the &s;ociety and improving conver&s;ation of his amiable friend, before all the amu&s;ements and honor which riches afford. When he perceiv|ed that Epaminondas would receive no &s;hare of that wealth which was bountifully be&s;towed up|on him, he learned equally to de&s;pi&s;e it, and changed his rich apparel for the decent cloath|ing of the philo&s;opher.</P>

Lacedemonians became jealous of their ri&s;ing fame, and wi&s;hed to extingui&s;h it&mdash;But they concealed their rancour by the ma&s;k of friend|&s;hip and alliance. About this time Sparta had re&s;olved upon an expedition again&s;t Olynthus. She had already di&s;patched Eudamidas at the head of a number of troops, and it was intend|ed that Phoebidas, his brother, &s;hould follow him at the head of eight thou&s;and more. This powerful reinforcement &s;et out from Pelopon|ne&s;us, and in their march northward encamped in the neighbourhood of Thebes.

The commotion of Thebes aro&s;e from a warm di&s;pute re&s;pecting the form of government. I&s;menias, Androclides, and Pe|lopidas headed a party zealous for Liberty, and a popular admini&s;tration&mdash;Archias, Leontides, and Philip, who were all very rich, immo|derately ambitious, &s;upported with the greate&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m and violence, and oligarchical form of government.

<P>Some eminent hi&s;torians have &s;uppo&s;ed this to have been a concerted plan with Sparta it|&s;elf&mdash;This, I think, is extremely probable, for Sparta, in a very few in&s;tances, was emi|nent for her political ju&s;tice.

unpardonable. Sparta, we have al&s;o &s;een, was at this time jealous of the increa&s;ing glory of Thebes, and elevated by the pitch of grandeur to which &s;he had arrived, as &s;he now held much the &s;uperiority over Athens: But the greate&s;t proof of this a&s;&s;ertion is the manner in which they behaved&mdash;After Phoebidas had taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the citadel, they deprived him of his command, fined him one hundred thou&s;and drachmas, but &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Cad|mea, and continued in it a &s;trong and well &s;upplied garri&s;on: An action incon&s;i&s;tent, ex|tremely ba&s;e, and one among the numerous others which bla&s;t the Spartan name. But, however this is, Phoebidas li&s;tened to the pro|po&s;al of this perfidious party; he was a general of much ambition, and who wi&s;hed very much to &s;ignalize him&s;elf in &s;ome extraordinary ac|tion: This one, which now opened before him, perfectly corre&s;ponded with his ideas of magnificence and greatne&s;s.

<P>Pelopidas addre&s;&s;ed them in an oration, de&s;ir|ing them to a&s;&s;i&s;t their country, and join with their gods in demoli&s;hing the tyranny of Sparta. The &s;ame day Pelopidas, with Meion and Charon, were cho&s;en Boetarchs.</P>
<P>Soon after the early arrival of the con&s;pira|tors from Thrai&s;ium, a body of men arrived from Athens, to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Pelopidas, con&s;i&s;ting of five thou&s;and foot and five hundred hor&s;e.

<P>The Cadmea &s;urrendered only a few days before the arrival of a fre&s;h force from Sparta.

<P>We &s;hall &s;ee in like manner, that the war which reduced the pride of Sparta, and de|prived it of the empire, both by &s;ea and land, was the work of this &s;ingle night, in which Pelopidas, without taking either citadel or for|tre&s;s, and entering only one of twelve into a private hou&s;e, unloo&s;ened and broke the chains impo&s;ed by the Lacedemonians on all the other &s;tates of Greece, though it appeared impracti|cable even to produce &s;uch an effect."</P>

<P>The Athenians immediately made a new al|liance with Thebes; fitted out a large fleet, commanded by the illu&s;trious Timotheus, &s;on of Conon. Age&s;ilaus, at the head of eighteen thou&s;and foot, and fifteen hundred hor&s;e, made frequent incur&s;ions in Boetia, committing great

The whole glory and great &s;ucce&s;s, at this period of the war, is ju&s;tly due to Pelo|pidas, for Epaminondas had not yet taken the lead of public affairs.</P>
<P>The arms of Thebes were crowned with victory at Platea and The&s;pioe, where Phoebi|das (the &s;ame per&s;on who had &s;urprized the Cadmea) was &s;lain.

<P>Deputies were &s;ent from the different &s;tates to Sparta, who &s;till held the power and con|troul of Greece; Epaminondas, whom we left pur&s;uing with ardor the paths of philo|&s;ophy, was at the head of this deputation.&mdash;He now became very much celebrat|ed for his profound knowledge and educa|tion; but he had not yet &s;hone con&s;picuous as a &s;tate&s;man and military hero: His friend Pe|lipodas was at this time the mo&s;t illu&s;trious hero of Greece, without Timotheus, the Athe|nian general, is con&s;idered as his equal.</P>

Epaminondas, firm and re&s;olved, replied again, a&s;king, "Whether, on his &s;ide, he would con&s;ent that Laconia &s;hould be free?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rollin.</NOTE></P>
<P>The tyrant, unaccu&s;tomed to the language of an independent hero, and of one who feared neither him nor his ab&s;olute power, upon the repetition of this que&s;tion, became &s;o inve|terate, that he bani&s;hed the Thebans out of the treaty of alliance which he was then con|cluding with the other &s;tates of Greece. The re&s;t of the allies &s;igned it, imperfect as it was, dreading the power of the Lacedemonians, if they refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this treaty, the armies of Athens were to be di&s;banded and recalled.</P>
<P>Thebes was now left alone to brave the fury of the mo&s;t powerful &s;tate of Greece. Age&s;i|laus, and his &s;on Archidamus, collected a very powerful Lacedemonian army, and &s;ummoned the aid of their confederates: Sickne&s;s prevented Age&s;ilaus from taking the field in per&s;on; but he commanded his colleague, Cleombrotus, to march without delay into the territories of the enemy, promi&s;ing him, that he &s;hould be &s;oon joined by a powerful reinforcement. Cleom|brotus halted in the plains of Leuctra; it was

&s;urrounded on all &s;ides by ridges of mountains, which reared their lofty heads to the &s;kies; the mo&s;t con&s;picuous of the&s;e were called Helicon, Citheron, and Cynocephaloe.

<P>The Thebans were extremely terrified; they &s;aw them&s;elves without a friend and &s;upporter, braving the waves of adver&s;ity, while the &s;tates of Greece looked on, and gave them up for lo&s;t. They little then knew that the abilities of one man were to &s;ecure them from impend|ing ruin, and make them triumphant over their foes. This was Epaminondas&mdash;We have hi|therto beheld him as an amiable man, a phi|lo&s;opher, and an orator; but now we will &s;ee him in the field of battle, &s;urrounded with vir|tue and glory. He was appointed by his coun|trymen &s;upreme general of the war, and had
<PB N="317" REF="028973_0320_0FDDCA4696A4D060">
&s;everal colleagues joined with him as generals. He immediately rai&s;ed all the troops which he po&s;&s;ibly could, and began his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">arch. Several per&s;ons, to prevent his marching, came and informed him of many unfavorable omens they had&mdash;He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> replied, "There is but one good omen, to fight for one's country."</P>
<P>Pelopidas then commanded the celebrated <HI>&s;acred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> which con&s;i&s;ted of youths nearly of the &s;ame age, bound together by friend|&s;hip and the neare&s;t ties, and re&s;olved never to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an enemy.</P>
<P>When Pelopidas left his hou&s;e to join the army, his young and beautiful wife, in taking her la&s;t farewell, with a &s;hower of tears, be|&s;eeched him to avoid as much danger as po&s;&s;i|ble, and to think of her while in the tumult and clangour of battle. He made this remark|able reply to her, "Private men are to be ad|vi&s;ed to take care of them&s;elves, but generals to take care of others."</P>
<P>It was a di&s;pute among the Theban generals, whether they &s;hould offer the enemy battle or not: Pelopidas was a warm advocate for battle; but three of the generals were again&s;t it; the voice of Epaminondas was only wanting to de|cide
<PB N="318" REF="028973_0321_0FDDCA067B291888">
it which way he plea&s;ed; he firmly de|clared for the engagement.</P>
<P>While the two armies lay at Leuctra, deter|mined on battle at the &s;ucceeding day, it is re|lated, that at the dead of night, when a &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s reigned throughout the camps, Pelo|pidas dreamt that he &s;aw the two Theban maids, who&s;e deaths we have related, weeping at their tombs, calling cur&s;es and evils upon the Spar|tans; that their father, Sceda&s;us, also appear|ed, commanding him, "to &s;acrifice a young red haired virgin, in honor of his daughters, if he de&s;ired to be victorious in the en&s;uing bat|tle."</P>
<P>The next morning when Pelopidas aro&s;e, and reflected on the dream, his humanity re|volted at the dreadful command; he re&s;olved in his mind not to obey it, notwith&s;tanding it was contrary to the opinion of the &s;ooth&s;ayers. While Pelopidas was in this frame of mind, a wild &s;he-colt, which had broken loo&s;e, ran neighing through the camp, but when &s;he ap|proached near the place where he was, &s;he &s;tood &s;till and &s;ilent: The whole army admired the &s;parkling redne&s;s of her mane; the &s;tateline&s;s of her form and actions. The thought in&s;tant|ly
<PB N="319" REF="028973_0322_0FDDCA4865B409E0">
occurred to Pelopidas, that this was the vir|gin which was repre&s;ented to him in his dream: He ordered her to b&eacute; &s;eized and &s;acrificed, in honor of the violated Theban maids.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance was &s;pread through the army, and tended to animate their &s;pirits. The time of battle arrived&mdash;The two armies were very unequal in number; the Lacedemonians con&s;i&s;ted of twenty-four thou&s;and foot, and &s;ix|teen hundred hor&s;e; the Thebans had only &s;ix thou&s;and foot, and four hundred hor&s;e, but all of them valiant men, determined to conquer or die.</P>
<P>The commanders of each army were very celebrated generals: Cleombrotus may be ju&s;tly ranked among the greate&s;t heroes that ever Sparta produced; and Epaminondas among the greate&s;t that ever the world produced. The two armies drew out upon a plain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rollin.</NOTE>&mdash;Cleom|brotus commanded on the right wing, con&s;i&s;t|ing of Spartans, on whom he mo&s;t confided. To receive the great advantage which his &s;u|periority of hor&s;e gave him, he placed them in front of the right wing, where he commanded.
<PB N="320" REF="028973_0323_0FDDCA0A5450CE40">
The allies who formed the left wing, were commanded by Archidamus, the &s;on of king Age&s;ilaus.</P>
<P>The Theban general viewed with attention this arrangement of the enemy; he was &s;en&s;i|ble, that the i&s;&s;ue of the battle would depend upon the dome&s;tic troops of Sparta, who were incomparably braver than their allies: He, therefore, re&s;olved to command in per&s;on the left wing, to &s;trengthen it with the be&s;t of his heavy armed troops, and to make a very vigor|ous attack on the right of the enemy, deter|mined to &s;eize or de&s;troy the per&s;on of Cleom|brotus. The &s;acred battalion, headed by his friend Pelopidas, he placed near his per&s;on; the&s;e clo&s;ed the left wing: The remainder of his infantry he drew up on his right in an ob|lique line, which the farther it extended, be|came more di&s;tant from the enemy: This cu|rious di&s;po&s;ition on the right was made, to pre|vent his little army from being &s;urrounded by the numbers of the enemy, who re&s;embled the form of a cre&s;cent: His hor&s;e he po&s;ted in the front of his left, after the manner of the La|cedemonians.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="028973_0324_0FDDCA4B7A8B4A18">
The action began with the cavalry: This &s;kirmi&s;h continued but a &s;hort time, when the &s;ixteen hundred hor&s;emen of the Lacedemoni|ans gave way, before the impetuo&s;ity and bravery of the four hundred Thebans: Being driven back upon the infantry, they put them into con&s;iderable confu&s;ion: This di&s;order was &s;till more increa&s;ed, by an impetuous &s;ally made upon the flank of Cleombrotus, by Pelopidas, at the head of his &s;acred band. Epaminondas followed clo&s;e his hor&s;e, and fell &s;uddenly on the phalanx with all the weight of his heavy battalion: He bore down all before him.

<P>Never before had the Lacedemonian arms re|ceived &s;o much di&s;grace; in their former mo&s;t bloody engagements, they had never more than five or &s;ix hundred of their citizens &s;lain; in this battle they lo&s;t four thou&s;and men; the Thebans only three hundred.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the battle of Leuctra in every circum&s;tance, the great numbers of the Lacedemonian army, their bravery, the excel|lency of their generals, we will be led to ex|claim,
<PB N="323" REF="028973_0326_0FDDCA4C8FC01EA8">
that this victory of Epaminondas is one of the mo&s;t glorious and a&s;toni&s;hing that has ever happened in the world: In no in&s;tance has the qualities of a general been &s;o eminently di&s;played.</P>
<P>Before the time of Pelopidas and Epaminon|das, the Thebans could not &s;tand before the victorious Spartans, and after their deaths, they fell again into the &s;ame degeneracy.</P>
<P>When the intelligence was &s;pread over Greece; that the Thebans, with the lo&s;s of only three hundred men, had gained an immortal victory over Sparta, it occa&s;ioned revolutions in every quarter.</P>
<P>The Thebans &s;ent an account of this victory to Athens, demanding at the &s;ame time aid again&s;t a common enemy; but the Senate of the Athenians, which was then &s;itting, influ|enced greatly by Timotheus and Iphicrates, treated the emba&s;&s;y rather coldly, and refu&s;ed the de&s;ired a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Epaminondas and Pelopidas were, after this battle, appointed joint governors of Boetia: They a&s;&s;embled all the troops of Boetia, and all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their allies, who&s;e number daily
<PB N="324" REF="028973_0327_0FDDCA11462647A0">
increa&s;ed, and entered Peloponne&s;us, driving all before them. Many places revolted from the &s;ubjection of the Spartans: among the&s;e were Elis, Argos, Arcadia, and the greate&s;t part of Laconia.</P>
<P>It was then about the winter &s;ol&s;tice, towards the end of the la&s;t month of the year&mdash;The fir&s;t day of the next month was the time appointed for the re&s;ignation of their offices; it was enacted by law, that death &s;hould be inflicted upon all tho&s;e who held them beyond that time: The re&s;t of the colleagues, fearful of bad wea|ther and of the dreadful con&s;equences of the infringement of the law, wi&s;hed that the army &s;hould march immediately back to Thebes&mdash;Epaminondas and Pelopidas, on the contrary, animated the citizens, and exhorted them to take advantage of the fear and alarm of the enemy, and to follow an enterpri&s;e, which would be of much benefit to the &s;tate, and which would more than compen&s;ate for the neglect of this formality. The army approved this &s;alutary advice. Epaminondas, therefore, entered La|conia at the head of &s;eventy thou&s;and &s;oldiers, a &s;mall part of which were Thebans.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="028973_0328_0FDDCA4E17B9D270">
The great reputation of the two generals had &s;pread &s;o exten&s;ively abroad, that allies flocked in numbers to their &s;tandard, obeyed with great re&s;pect their orders, and marched confident of &s;ucce&s;s, when they were their leaders.</P>
<P>In this expedition they united all Arcadia into one body; they captured Me&s;&s;enia, driv|ing before them the Spartans, who had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it near two hundred and eighty|&s;even years. It was a country extremely fer|tile, and in extent nearly equal to Laconia.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rollin.</NOTE> Epaminondas called to their paternal country its ancient inhabitants, who were di&s;per&s;ed in the different &s;tates of Greece, Italy, and Sicily: They heard the friendly invitation, and, ani|mated by the love of their country, inherent in|humanity, they flocked in joyful crouds to their once happy land.</P>
<P>This wi&s;e and benevolent action-of the The|ban gave immoderate grief to the Spartans: an|inveterate animo&s;ity had always prevailed be|tween them and the Me&s;&s;enians, and was in|capable of being extingui&s;hed until the ruin of one party.</P>
<P>It is related, that Epaminondas, after having ravaged the country in &s;ight of Sparta, cro&s;&s;ed
<PB N="326" REF="028973_0329_0FDDCA1504EE7380">
the river Eurotas, which was at that time very much &s;welled by the melting of the &s;nows: as he pa&s;&s;ed at the head of his infantry, &s;ome of the Spartans pointed him out to Age&s;ilaus, who, after having for a con&s;iderable time &s;urveyed him in a very thoughtful manner, rai&s;ed up his hands, and &s;aid, <HI>"wonderful man."</HI></P>
<P>After the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the rapidity of which we can &s;carcely imagine, Epaminondas led his army through Cenchea, on his return home.&mdash;During his march he defeated the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, who, to prevent his pa&s;&s;age, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> him, in narrow ways, with which that country abounds.</P>
<P>The two Thebans, when they returned home, after having performed &s;uch memorable actions, in&s;tead of receiving honor and applau&s;e from a grateful country, were &s;ummoned to appear as criminals again&s;t the &s;tate, for having di&s;obeyed one of its &s;tricte&s;t laws, in retaining their com|mands four months after the term appointed for their re&s;ignation; during which time they performed tho&s;e exploits which we have briefly related.</P>
<P>Such a behaviour, at fir&s;t view, excites in|dignation in every generous brea&s;t&mdash;But when
<PB N="327" REF="028973_0330_0FDDCA4FA23F26A0">
we con&s;ider, that it is upon the obedience of the laws that the exi&s;tence of government de|pends, and particularly the &s;ituation of Thebes at that time, who had lately recovered her free|dom, our indignation ought to be changed into admiration. Thebes rejoiced at their victories, but &s;till they arraigned their laurelled heroes to the court of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>When the&s;e two generals appeared before the magi&s;trates, Epaminondas, in&s;tead of plead|ing his cau&s;e, delivered an eulogy on the vic|tories he had gained, together with his friend&mdash;He &s;tood undaunted, although &s;urrounded by per&s;ons envious of his glory&mdash;He &s;purned from him &s;upplication, or language unworthy of a philo&s;opher. Both he and Pelopidas were unanimou&s;ly acquitted, and he returned from his trial, as he did from battle, &s;urrounded with glory and univer&s;al applau&s;e.</P>
<P>When the Lacedemonians beheld the The|bans &s;ucce&s;sful in every undertaking, and daily increa&s;ing in &s;trength and grandeur, they began to tremble &s;o, the fate of Sparta&mdash;They knew the enterpri&s;ing &s;pirits of Epaminondas and Pelopidas, and they had dreadfully experienced the terrors, of their arms. That imperial &s;tate,
<PB N="328" REF="028973_0331_0FDDCA1695182968">
which lately gave law to Athens, di&s;patched an orator, who &s;orrowfully implored their kind protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The orator de&s;crib|ed, in the mo&s;t pathetic terms, the mi&s;eries, the eminent danger in which Sparta remained; the haughtine&s;s of Thebes, and her ambition, which extended its views to the empire of all Greece: He repre&s;ented the danger which Athens her&s;elf had to fear, if, without oppo&s;i|tion, Thebes was allowed to drive all before her, and daily acquire new allies: He dwelt upon the time when a &s;trict union prevailed be|tween Athens and Sparta, and when, by their united efforts, they pre&s;erved all Greece from de&s;truction.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gold&s;mith.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Athenians acknowledged the ju&s;tne&s;s of mo&s;t parts of this di&s;cour&s;e: They felt &s;orrow for the di&s;tre&s;s of Sparta, and were jealous of the increa&s;ing power of Thebes. Their com|pa&s;&s;ion entirely forgave the injuries they had formerly received from their armies, and they finally determined to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Lacedemonians with the whole of their forces. A league and con&s;ederacy was concluded again&s;t the Thebans.</P>
<P>The king of Per&s;ia, de&s;irous to reconcile the Grecian &s;tates, &s;ent one Phili&s;cus for that pur|po&s;e;

but his emba&s;&s;y proved un&s;ucce&s;sful.&mdash;He then returned home, after having be&s;towed large &s;ums to the Spartans for carrying on the war.</P>
<P>The Spartans, not yet content with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the Athenians, and wi&s;hing &s;till to enlarge the confederacy, di&s;patched deputies to the great king.</P>
<P>When the Thebans heard this, they thought it was nece&s;&s;ary to deputize &s;ome per&s;on on their &s;ide&mdash;Pelopidas was cho&s;en for this pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The fame of his great exploits had &s;pread &s;o exten&s;ively abroad, and had rai&s;ed him &s;o great in the eyes of the world, that when he appear|ed at court among the princes and nobility, they received him with joy and acclamations; they related his exploits, and crowned him with prai&s;e and applau&s;e. Artaxerxes paid him ex|traordinary honours; he publicly extolled him before his lords. After having heard him &s;peak, more nervous than the Athenian amba&s;&s;ador, and more &s;imple than the Lacedemonian, he e&s;teemed him more than ever&mdash;He gave him far the preference to all the re&s;t of the Grecian deputies. The king granted to Pelopidas all

his reque&s;ts, &s;o that he entirely baffled the de|&s;ires of the confederates.</P>
<P>He returned home, cloathed with honor, and without accepting any of the riches of Per&s;ia; a behavior widely different from Timagoras, the Athenian amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>The e&s;teem of Thebes for him was augment|ed by the good &s;ucce&s;s of his emba&s;&s;y, which had procured the freedom of Greece, and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Me&s;&s;ene.</P>
<P>Shortly after the return of Pelopidas from this emba&s;&s;y, new troubles aro&s;e in Greece, which called him once more into the field of battle.</P>
<P>Alexander, the tyrant of Pheroe, entertained &s;ecret de&s;igns of &s;ubduing all The&s;&s;aly under his &s;ubjection. He declared open war again&s;t &s;everal parts of it.</P>
<P>The terrified The&s;&s;alonians immediately di&s;|patched amba&s;&s;adors to Thebes, begging the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome troops and a general. Epa|minondas was at that time engaged in the Pe|loponne&s;ian war. The command of this ex|pedition was unanimou&s;ly given to Pelopidas: He marched with an army to The&s;&s;aly in a lit|tle time&mdash;reduced Sari&s;&s;a to a capitulation, and
<PB N="331" REF="028973_0334_0FDDCA5660E56EB8">
obliged Alexander to come, in a &s;uppliant man|ner, and make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to him. He endea|vored, by mild and lenient behavior, to &s;often his hardened di&s;po&s;ition, and to change the cruel tyrant into the humane prince; but, finding the&s;e endeavors ineffectual, and hearing every day of his cruelties and vicious pur&s;uits, he exerci&s;ed more &s;everity towards him. The tyrant, upon this u&s;age, &s;ecretly fled with his guards.</P>
<P>Pelopidas, having &s;ettled the affairs of The&s;|&s;aly, and defeated the &s;chemes of Alexander, led his army to Macedonia, where Ptolemy was carrying on war again&s;t his brother Alexander, the king of Macedon, re&s;pecting &s;ome politi|cal affairs. The two brothers had invited him to be the judge and arbitrator of their quarrel, and to e&s;pou&s;e that &s;ide which &s;hould appear to him to be the mo&s;t ju&s;t.</P>
<P>When he arrived, he quieted all di&s;turbances and di&s;putes; he recalled all tho&s;e per&s;ons who had been bani&s;hed by either party, and returned to Thebes, taking with him Philip, the brother of Alexander, and thirty youths of the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious families of Macedonia, to &s;hew the

Greeks the authority of the Thebans, and the exten&s;ive reputation of their arms. One of the ho&s;tages was that Philip, who was father of Alexander the Great, and who afterwards en|&s;laved Greece. It is &s;aid, that he placed Epa|minondas as his model for imitation as a war|rior&mdash;but the other excellencies and virtues of this truly great man, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not the lea&s;t &s;hare of them.</P>
<P>The troubles of Macedonia had &s;ub&s;ided on|ly for a &s;hort time, when they broke out again with greater fury than ever. Ptolemy murder|ed his brother Alexander, and &s;eized the king|dom.

<P>Always willing to lend his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to di&s;|tre&s;s, he readily undertook their cau&s;e.
