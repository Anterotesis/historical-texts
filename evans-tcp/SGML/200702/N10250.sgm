<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WHEN I view the original right, power and <HI>Charter,</HI> confirm'd, &s;ealed, and ratified to the Province, or Inhabitants of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> and its &s;tanding in full force, and unrepealed for more than an hundred years; which is as fol|lows:&mdash;
<Q>Be it enacted, that no freeman, &s;hall be taken, or impri&s;oned, or deprived of his freehold, or liberty, or free cu&s;tom, or be out-law'd, or exil'd, or other|wi&s;e de&s;troy'd, nor &s;hall be oppre&s;&s;ed, judged or condemned, but by the Law of this Colony.&mdash;And that no man of what &s;tate or condition &s;oever, &s;hall be put out of his lands or Tenements, nor taken, nor impri&s;oned, nor di&s;inherited, nor BANISHED, (ob&s;erve this my Lord,) nor any ways de|&s;troy'd, or MOLESTED, without being, for it, brought to an|&s;wer, by a due cour&s;e of Law of this COLONY:</Q>
Me|thinks, that even your Lord&s;hip, will not blame them if they &s;tand fa&s;t in the Liberty wherein they were made free.</P>
<P>As a fly, or a worm, by the law of nature, has as great a right to Liberty, and Freedom, (according to their little

&s;phere in life,) as the mo&s;t potent monarch upon the earth: And as there can be no other difference between your Lord|&s;hip, and my&s;elf, but what is political, I therefore, without any further apology, take leave to a&s;k your Lord&s;hip, whether any one that fears GOD, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> as him&s;elf, (which is the true Scripture-mark of a chri&s;tian,) will OP|PRESS his fellow-creatures? if they will, where are the beauties of Chri&s;tianity? Not to be &s;een in this life, how|ever they may be &s;een in the next.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;een what is &s;aid to be an authenticated copy of your Lord&s;hip's Letter to the Govenor of Rhode-I&s;land, in which there are &s;uch DICTATIONS. DIRECTIONS, and po&s;&s;itive COM|MANDS, to oppre&s;s, with tyranny, a <HI>free People,</HI> which is incon&s;i&s;tent with a good man, or a Chri&s;tian to have any concern or agency therein. The law of GOD directs us to do unto others, as we would they &s;hould do unto us. And knowing that your Lord&s;hip is well acquainted with the Divine Oracles, having had the honour to dine at your Lord&s;hip's Seat, in Stafford&s;hire, and was, when in England, per&s;onally acquainted with Mr. <HI>Wright,</HI> your Lord&s;hip's Stew|ard, and with the good and pious Character your Lord&s;hip bears. I therefore take this leave (as fellow-chri&s;tian, as one that loves, as the highe&s;t happine&s;s of his exi&s;tence, the <HI>Beau|ties, Spirit,</HI> and LIFE of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI>) to a&s;k your Lord&s;hip, how your Lord&s;hip would like to have his Birth-right, Liberty and freedom, as an Engli&s;hman, taken away by his King, or by the Mini&s;try, or both? Would not your Lord&s;hip im|mediately &s;ay, it was Tyranny, Oppre&s;&s;ion and Di&s;truction, by a di&s;potic power? Would not your Lord&s;hip be ready to alarm the Nation; and point out the STATE upon the brink of di&s;truction?</P>
<P><HI>My LORD,</HI> ARE not the Liberties of the Americans as dear to them as tho&s;e of Britons? Suppo&s;e your Lord&s;hip had broke the Laws of his King, and Country; would not your Lord&s;hip be willing to be try'd by a Jury of your peers, according to the Laws of the land? How would your Lord&s;hip like to be fetter'd with irons, and drag'd three thou&s;and miles, in a hell upon earth? No! but in a HELL upon water <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Through a Man of War's crew.</NOTE>, to take your trial? is not this contrary to the &s;pirit of the law, and the rights
<PB N="vii" REF="013015_0005_0F8FB06B49479C40">
of an Engli&s;hman? Yet thus you have given direction, as the King's Agent, or the agent of the Mini&s;try, to de&s;troy the rights and laws of the Americans. How your Lord&s;hip can an&s;wer for this agency of inju&s;tice before GOD, and Man, will be very difficult: However, if great men, and good men, and Chri&s;tians can dare to do &s;uch things as the&s;e (when in power,) Heaven grant that I may have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> acquaintance with them in this world; or if they have any power in Heaven, not in the world to come; for I think, my Lord, that &s;uch men, who will take away the Rights of any peo|ple, are neither fit for Heaven, nor Earth, either fit for the Land or the Dunghil.</P>
<P>YOUR Lord&s;hip lets us know that the ca&s;e of the burning the Ga&s;pee Schooner has been laid before the law &s;ervants of the Crown, and that they make the crime of a deeper die than piracy, namely, an act of high trea&s;on, and levying a war again&s;t the King.</P>
<P>WELL my Lord, and &s;uppo&s;ing this to be the ca&s;e, are not the Rhode-I&s;landers &s;ubjects to the King of Great-Britain? Has not the King his attorney, his courts of judicatory to decide matters between the King and the &s;ubjects? Why then mu&s;t there be New Courts of admiralty erected to appoint and order the inha|bitants to be confin'd, and drag'd away three thou&s;and miles, from their families, laws, rights and liberties, to be tried by their ene|mies? Do you think my Lord, this is right in the &s;ight of God and Man? I think if the Rhode I&s;landers &s;uffer this infringement of their liberties, granted them by their Charter, from the King of England, any place out of Hell is good enough for them, for was there ever &s;uch cruelty, inju&s;tice and barbarity ever united again&s;t a free people before, and my Lord Dartmouth to have an hand in it, from whom we might rather have expected mildne&s;s, mercy, and the rights of the people &s;upported.</P>
<P>YOUR Lord&s;hip's letter frequently reminds us that this de&s;tructive authority, (to de&s;troy the lives and liberties of the people) is his Maje&s;ty's will and plea&s;ure.&mdash;How far his Maje&s;ty may be influenc'd and dictated by his Mini&s;try I will not take upon me to &s;ay, but that it is his Maje&s;ty's will and plea&s;ure of his own mind and con&s;ent, I will not believe a word of it, for his Maje&s;ty is a per&s;on of more tenderne&s;s and under&s;tanding, than to attempt &s;uch tyranny, be&s;ides, his attempt to de&s;troy the Rights of the People&mdash;de&s;troys his Right as King to reign over them, for ac|cording
<PB N="viii" REF="013015_0006_0F8FB06BF61F54D8">
to his Coronation oath, he has no longer a Right to the Bri|ti&s;h Crown or Throne, than he maintains inviolable firm the Laws and Rights of the People. For violating the people's rights, Charles Steward, King of England lo&s;t his Head, and if another King, who is more &s;olemnly bound than ever Charles Steward was, &s;hould tread in the &s;ame &s;teps, what can he expect? I reverence and love my King, but I rever the rights of an Engli&s;hman before the authority of any King upon the Earth. I di&s;tingui&s;h greatly between a King and a Tyrant, a King is the guardian and tru&s;tee of the rights and laws of the people, but a Tyrant de&s;troys them.</P>
<P>BESIDES my Lord, the inhabitants of America know as well
<Q>as the people of England, that the people are the right and fountain of power and authority, the original &s;eat of Maje&s;ty&mdash; the Author of laws, and the creators of officers to execute them. And if at any time they &s;hall find the power they have conferred abu&s;ed by their TRUSTEES, their MAJESTY violated by tyranny, or by u&s;urpation, their authority pro&s;tituted to &s;up|port <HI>violence,</HI> or &s;kreen <HI>corruption,</HI> the laws grown pernicious through accidents unfore&s;een, or rendered ineffectual through the infidelity of the executors of them. Then it is their RIGHT and what is their right, is undoubtedly their priviledge and duty, (as their e&s;&s;ential power and Maje&s;ty) to re&s;ume that delegated power and authority they intru&s;ted them with, and call their tru&s;tees to an ACCOUNT; to re&s;i&s;t the u&s;urpation, and extirpate the tyranny; to re&s;tore their &s;ullied MAJESTY and their pro&s;tituted AUTHORITY; to &s;u&s;pend, alter or abro|gate tho&s;e laws, and puni&s;h the unfaithful and corrupt officers. Nor is it the duty only of the united body but EVERY member of it ought, according to his re&s;pective rank, power and weight in the community, to CONCUR in advancing tho&s;e glorious de&s;igns.</Q>&mdash;<Q>This is my Lord the happy con&s;titution of England, the power, right and Maje&s;ty of the people which has been frequently recognized and e&s;tabli&s;hed. By which Maje&s;ty, right and power, Kings are made, and UNMADE by the choice of the people; and laws enacted, and <HI>annulled</HI> only by their own con&s;ent, in which none can be deprived of their property, abridged of their <HI>freedom,</HI> or <HI>forfeit</HI> their lives with|out an appeal to the laws, and the verdict of their Peers or equals.</Q>
&mdash;My Lord, as this is according to the laws of England, the liberty, priviledge and power of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in Great-Britain, why not then the priviledge of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ub|jects
<PB N="ix" REF="013015_0007_0F8FB06D2EBA6700">
in America? has his Maje&s;ty (as it &s;eems to be all laid upon him) two kind of laws, one for England and the other for <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> a power to reign as King and guardian of his people's rights at home, and a power to de&s;troy the rights of the Colonies abroad? I really don't under&s;tand it my Lord, if he has no right to do it, why does he do it? If you &s;ay the king does not do it, why do you &s;ay he does? This is u&s;ing his Maje&s;ty cruel. However &s;omebody does it, your Lord&s;hip &s;ays it is his Maje&s;ty with his Privy Coun&s;el, the latter I rather think. However be it who it will, whether the <HI>King, Mini&s;try</HI> or <HI>Parliament,</HI> they have no more right to do it, than they have to cut your Lord&s;hip's throat. Has not your Lord&s;hip a right to oppo&s;e any power that may a&s;|&s;ault your Lord&s;hip's Per&s;on, right or privilege, without its been deem'd rebellion again&s;t the King and &s;tate?&mdash;Yes, &s;ure you have! Then &s;urely my Lord an American has the &s;ame right to oppo&s;e every u&s;urping power (let it be from whom it will) that a&s;&s;aults his per&s;on, or deprives him of his own law or liberty as an Ame|rican. Has he <HI>offended,</HI> yes! Is he willing to be tried by his own laws? yes! Then that man, that King, that mini&s;ter of &s;tate, be who he will, is wor&s;e than a Nero TYRANT that &s;hall a&s;&s;ume to drag him three thou&s;and miles to be tried by his ENEMIES.</P>
<P>BESIDES my Lord, what is <HI>rebellion,</HI> if I under&s;tand it right, they are per&s;ons ri&s;ing up with an a&s;&s;umed authority and power to act, dictate and rule in direct violation to the laws of the land&mdash;I believe my Lord, I am right here for this rea&s;on, your General FANNING, and your Governor TRYON when in North Caro|lina, thought &s;o, and like cruel blood thir&s;ty <HI>&s;avages,</HI> murdered mankind for thinking that they had a right to oppo&s;e any power that attempted to de&s;troy their LIBERTIES. This was my Lord a cruel barbarous &s;laughter of mankind&mdash;However, if it was deemed rebellion in them, and they were treated as <HI>rebels,</HI> bacau&s;e they (as the mini&s;try &s;aid) broke the laws of the government of the Province; then &s;urely it follows, that the King's Mini&s;try and Parliament mu&s;t be REBELS, to God and mankind, in attempting to overthrow, (by guns, by &s;words, by the power of war) the laws, and government of Rhode-I&s;land. Have not the Rhode-I&s;landers as much right to the privileges of their own laws, as the King of England has to his Crown? &s;ure they have! Then &s;urely, that man mu&s;t be a tyrant in his &s;oul, that &s;hall deem it rebellion in the Rhode-I&s;landers, &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hould kill every man, that &s;hall attempt to de&s;troy their laws, rights and liberties.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="013015_0008_0F8FB06D8E759578">IT is true my Lord, the Ga&s;pee Schooner is de&s;troyed, and thereby the Laws of England are violated, (as you apprehend,) by Indians out of the woods, or by Rhode-I&s;landers, I cannot &s;ay who; but it is a query with me my Lord, whether there is any Law broke in burning the Ga&s;pee Schooner; if it was done by the INDIANS (which is the current report) then there is no Law broke; for the Scripture &s;ays, "<HI>where there is no Law, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI> And it is well known, that the Indians were never under any Law to the Engli&s;h; did I &s;ay, they were never under any Law to the Engli&s;h, Heaven forgive me! I mean my Lord no other Law, than the Sword and Bayonet; the &s;ame law that &s;ome would fain bring the Americans under now. But &s;uppo&s;e my Lord, that this deed was done by the Rhode-I&s;landers, the query is &s;till with me&mdash;whether there is any tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion committed? the Scripture &s;ays, where there is no Law, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: Now, the que&s;tion is, do the Rhode-I&s;landers receive their Laws from England? if &s;o, there is a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion committed again&s;t tho&s;e Laws, but if not, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, for where there is no Law, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, &s;ays St. James. For my part, I can|not &s;ee how any Man in America, can properly break the Laws of England. The whole lies here, the laws of America only are broke, let the offender then be try'd by the law he has broke, what can ju&s;tice, I had almo&s;t &s;aid <HI>tyrany</HI> de&s;ire more. However my Lord, there is another idea ari&s;es in my mind, (and it is no wonder, for the Bo&s;tonians are very notional) which is, if there is any law broke, it is the King and the mini&s;try who have broke it; for I would be glad to know my Lord, what right the King and mini&s;try has to &s;end an armed Schooner to Rhode-I&s;land, to take away the property of the people, any more than they have to &s;end an armed Schooner into <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> and demand the property of France. Know this, that the King of England has no more right, according to the laws of God and nature, to claim the lands of America, than he has the lands of France&mdash;America, my Lord, in the native rights of the Americans, it is the blood bought trea&s;ure of their forefathers; and they have the &s;ame e&s;&s;ential right to their <HI>native laws,</HI> as they have to the air they breath in, or to the light of the morning, when the &s;un ri&s;es; and therefore they who oppre&s;s the Americans mu&s;t be as great enemies to the rights of the laws of nature, as they who would (if it were in their power) vail the light of the &s;un from the univer&s;e. Remember my Lord, the Americans have
<PB N="xi" REF="013015_0009_0F8FB06E39476038">
a privilege to boa&s;t of above all the world. They never were in bondage to any man, and therefore it is more for them to give up their RIGHTS, than it is for all Europe to give up their RIGHTS into the hands of the TURKS; con&s;ider what Engli&s;h tyranny their forefathers fled from, what &s;eas of di&s;tre&s;s they met with? what &s;avages they fought with? what blood-bought trea&s;ures, as the dear inheritance of their lives, they have left to their children. Without any aid from the King of England; and yet after this, the&s;e free-born people mu&s;t be counted REBELS, if they will not loo&s;e every right of Liberty, which their forefathers bought with their blood, and &s;ubmit again to engli&s;h mini&s;terial <HI>tyranny</HI>&mdash;O America! O America!</P>
<P>MY Lord, I hope I need not remind your Lord&s;hip of the en|quiry that the divine Me&s;&s;iah made to PETER, when they required a tax, or tribute, from him. Of whom, &s;ays CHRSIT, to PETER, do they gather tax, or tribute, of the children, or of &s;trangers? And PETER &s;aid, of &s;trangers: Then, &s;ays CHRIST, the chil|dren are FREE. Now, the Ga&s;pee Schooner, my Lord, was a &s;tranger; and they &s;hould, if it was in their commi&s;&s;ion, have gathered tax from &s;trangers: But in&s;tead of which, they would gather it from the children. They forgot that the <HI>children were free</HI>: Therefore, my Lord, it mu&s;t certainly be, that the Ga&s;pee Schooner has committed the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and broke the Laws, of the freedom of this country. No doubt, my Lord, but they have a right to tax the &s;trangers, that come to dwell in their country; but to tax the children, which are free in their own native country, this will not do! Nature forbids it; the law of GOD condemns it. And no law, but that of tyranny, can de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>And therefore it was, my Lord, that the children, (who are by the law of GOD, and the law of nature FREE) looked upon the Ga&s;pee Schooner as a &s;tranger, as &s;uch they treated her; but when the &s;tranger attempted to gather tax of the children who are free, then they looked upon her, as a <HI>Pirate,</HI> who took away their property without their con&s;ent, by violence, by arms, by <HI>guns,</HI> by <HI>oaths</HI> and <HI>damnations</HI>: This they thought looked &s;o like <HI>Piracy,</HI> that the children did not like it; and they thought their behavior as &s;trangers was very <HI>unpolite,</HI> that they could not &s;o much as pa&s;s by the&s;e &s;trangers, but the children mu&s;t bow to them, and come to them; this the children, being free, did not like, and they thought it was be&s;t for the children, and the &s;trangers, all to be free: And therefore, one night, my Lord, they went and &s;et the &s;trangers, (who, by the way, where all pri&s;oners) free&mdash;free
<PB N="xii" REF="013015_0010_0F8FB06F0678F3B0">
upon the face of the whole earth; and then to pre&s;erve them free, they burnt their pri&s;on. Now, my Lord, would it not be hard to hang the&s;e poor men for it? However,</P>
<P>If there is any law broke, it is this, that the Ga&s;pee Schooner, by the power of the Engli&s;h mini&s;try and admiralty have broke the laws, and taken away the rights of the Americans. And yet the Americans mu&s;t be puni&s;h'd for it, contrary to their own laws. O! Amazing! I would be glad to know my Lord, what right the King of England has to America, it cannot be an hereditary right that lies in <HI>Hanover,</HI> it cannot be a parliamentary right that lies in Britain, not a victorious right, for the King of Eng|land never conquered America. Then he can have no more right to America, than what the people have, by compact, inve&s;ted him with, which is only a power to protect them, and defend their rights civil and religious; and to &s;ign, &s;eal, and confirm as their &s;teward &s;uch laws as the people of America &s;hall con&s;ent to. If this be the ca&s;e, my Lord, then judge whether the King of England and the mini&s;try are not the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors in this affair, in &s;ending <HI>armed Schooners</HI> to America, to &s;teal by power and &s;word the people's property. And if any are to be try'd for law-break+ers, it &s;urely ought, in ju&s;tice, to be them. But the people of AMERICA act my Lord very hone&s;t in the affair, they are wil|ling to GIVE and TAKE, to give the Engli&s;h offenders the liberty to be try'd by their own laws, and to take the &s;ame liberty wherein they have offended to be tried by their own laws, they &s;urely have as much right to the privileges of their own laws, as the King of England has to his Crown, or that the natives of Britain has to the rights of an Engli&s;hman.&mdash;Con&s;ider then, my Lord, how <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ul, how UNJUST, how unan&s;werable before God and Man it mu&s;t be, by any violence and power to de&s;troy the rights of the Americans.</P>
<P>MY Lord, the clo&s;e of your Lord&s;hip's letter, is &s;uch that is enough to make the blood of every vein &s;tand <HI>&s;tagnated</HI> as a te&s;|timony again&s;t mini&s;terial bloody power. It not only gives a right to every American to be angry, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to be incen&s;ed again&s;t your Lord&s;hip, wherein you tell the Governor of Rhode-I&s;land, that it is his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, that General Gage, hold the troops in readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t this a&s;&s;umed court of admiralty, to de&s;troy the rights of the people. What my Lord, is bloody Bonner's days &s;o near America? O America! O America! What, the blood-power of the &s;word and death to aid civil magi&s;trates to de&s;troy
<PB N="xiii" REF="013015_0011_0F8FB06FB4145A08">
the people's rights? Stop a little my Lord, give a little breathing time&mdash;for it is a &s;olemn thing to die. I wonder your Lord&s;hip's knees did not &s;mite together when as the King's, or mini&s;terial agent, you wrote this authority, how a good man, a chri&s;tian, and one that fears God, can be an agent not only to de&s;troy the rights of a people, but to oppre&s;s them, with the military power of blood and death, is enough to make the Earth to reel, and all Heaven to &s;tand agha&s;t! Be a&s;toni&s;h'd O ye Heavens at this! I hope, my Lord, you do not intend to renew that bloody, barba|rous a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination in <HI>America</HI> which I &s;aw the <HI>Scotch barbarian troops</HI> thro' the orders of Lord B&mdash;n and Lord W&mdash;h &s;pread in St. George's helds, remember the blood of young Allen cries to Heaven for vengeance in their face, and a louder voice than Abel's blood, which cry'd to Heav'n for vengeance, is &s;till heard in Bo&s;ton &s;treets, again&s;t a bloody military power, and tho' the murderers e&s;caped by a &s;cene well known to &s;ome, but too dark to explain&mdash;Yet the God of truth &amp; ju&s;tice &s;tands at the door. Suppo&s;ing my Lord, that the Rhode-I&s;landers, for the &s;ake of the blood bought liberties of their forefathers, for the &s;ake of the birthrights of their children, &s;hould &s;hew a &s;pirit of re&s;entment again&s;t a tyrannical arbitrary power that attempts to de&s;troy their lives, liberties and property, would it not be un&s;ufferable, cruel, for this (which the law of nature and nations teaches them to do) to be butchered, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated and &s;laughtered in their own &s;treets by their own King? Con&s;ider, my Lord, that we mu&s;t all appear before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t, and that it would be a <HI>cold cordial</HI> for your Lord&s;hip at the bar of God, to have thou|&s;ands of Americans ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t you. Yet I would rather this was the ca&s;e, tho' I &s;uffer'd death with them, than they &s;hould lo&s;e their e&s;&s;ential rights as Americans.</P>
<P>BUT it may be meet to let your Lord&s;hip know, that if the Americans unite (as there &s;eems a good pro&s;pect of it) to &s;tand as a <HI>band of brethren</HI> for their liberties, they have aright, by the law of GOD, of nature, and of nations, to reluctant, and even to re&s;i&s;t any military &amp; marine force, &s;urely they mu&s;t be intended in readine&s;s for the <HI>French</HI> not for Americans, for can it ever enter into the heart of a mother to murder her children? of a King to kill his &s;ubjects? of an agent to de&s;troy the rights of the <HI>Colonies</HI> he repre&s;ents? But, &s;uppo&s;e my Lord, that this &s;hould be the bloody intent of the mini&s;try, to make the Americans &s;ubject to their <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> then let <HI>blood</HI> for <HI>blood, life</HI> for <HI>life,</HI> and <HI>death</HI>

<P>That they may do evil with both hands, earne&s;tly, the Prince a&s;keth, and the Judge a&s;keth for a Reward; and the great Man he uttereth his mi&s;chievous de&s;ire: <HI>SO THEY WRAP IT UP.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE faithfulne&s;s of the prophet <HI>Micah</HI>; the fidelity of his heart, and the zeal of his &s;oul for the liberties of the people, was remarkable. His faithfulne&s;s when <HI>tyranny</HI> reigned by authority;
<PB N="16" REF="013015_0014_0F8FB072F8D869F8">
when the laws, rights and liberties of the people were at the di&s;po&s;e of the arbitary power of the wicked king AHAZ, as it is written 2 Chron. 28.1.
<Q>And Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and be reigned &s;ixteen years in Jeru&s;alem, but he did not that which was right in the &s;ight of the Lord; like David his father. Ver. <HI>19.</HI> For the Lord brought Judah low, becau&s;e of Ahaz king of I&s;rael, for he made Judah naked and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed &s;ore again&s;t the Lord, ver. <HI>22.</HI> And in the time of this di&s;tre&s;s did he tre&s;pa&s;s yet more and more again&s;t the Lord&mdash;this is that king <HI>AHAZ.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And therefore this faithful prophet lays the matter to heart, as one that rever'd the liberties and happi|ne&s;s of the people above the authority of the king, and the power of his <HI>&s;enates.</HI> And therefore &s;ays in the ver&s;e preceding the text,
<Q>The good man is peri&s;hed out of the earth, and there is none up|right among men, they all lie in wait for blood, they hunt every man his brother with a net,</Q>
and is not the ca&s;e at <HI>this</HI> day? for what is the mini&s;try hunting after now, is not every one hunting for their brother, with the NET of admiralty courts and ty|ranny? if they can but once get their American brethren in this <HI>net,</HI> they may kick and flirt as long as they will, they'll never get out no more. It is indeed &s;aid "In vain is the net &s;pread in the &s;ight of the bird" and that he has made us wi&s;er than the fowls of the air, but wherein will the Americans ap|pear to be wi&s;er than the fowls of the air, if they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be taken in this mini&s;terial <HI>net?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="013015_0015_0F8FB0737AB893D8">OBSERVE, that it was a dark time with the na|tion, a dark time with the church of the <HI>living God,</HI> and a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing time re&s;pecting the people, when Micah appeared cotempory with I&s;aiah, as a prophet of the Lord, and a SON of LIBERTY, therefore he tells the oppre&s;&s;ors of the people,
<Q>The be&s;t of them is a brier, and the mo&s;t upright of them &s;harper than a thorn hedge&mdash;the day of the watchmen, and thy vi&s;itation cometh, now &s;hall be their perplexity.</Q>
And is not this the ca&s;e? Is not the day of the watch|men of America come, who watch for the rights of the people, as the centinels of the land, to defend them from every inva&s;ion of power and de&s;truction? Now their vi&s;itation in Providence is come&mdash;to try the watchmen whether they will &s;tand for God, and the people, or not Now &s;hall be their perplexity of the mini&s;try, who lie in wait for blood and hunt every man his brother with a net, who utter their mi&s;chievous de&s;ire, and &s;o <HI>they wrap it up.</HI>&mdash;For this faithfulne&s;s, in king Ahaz, and Hezekiah's days, the prophet Micah's name has a &s;ingular honor in the annals of Heaven above the re&s;t of the prophets in I&s;rael&mdash;Jer. 17, 18, 19. becau&s;e he &s;aid&mdash;"hear this I pray you ye heads of the hou&s;e of Jacob, and <HI>Princes</HI> of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, that abhor judgment and pervert all equity.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, tho&s;e &s;ayings of that pious prelate of the church of England, bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet,</HI> in his hi&s;tory of his own time, are noble, valuable and great, e&s;pecially were he &s;ays,
<Q>that there is not any thing more certain than this: That kings are <HI>made</HI> for
<PB N="18" REF="013015_0016_0F8FB07448E9A978">
the <HI>people,</HI> and not the people for them.</Q>
Was not <HI>David</HI> made a king for the people? Was not <HI>Saul?</HI> Was not <HI>Solomon?</HI> Then let not kings think too highly of them&s;elves; for the GOD of heaven never intended they &s;hould be any more than the <HI>&s;ervants</HI> of the <HI>people</HI>; therefore the bi&s;hop adds,
<Q>that, perhaps, there is no nation under the hea|ven more &s;en&s;ible of this than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation; &s;o that, if the <HI>prince</HI> does not govern, by this maxim, the <HI>people</HI> will &s;oon grow very unkind to him.</Q>
If this be the ca&s;e, the king of England may imediately &s;ee the rea&s;on of all his peoples hard &s;peeches, and unkindne&s;s to him: It is becau&s;e he has departed, either by inclination, or per&s;ua&s;ion, from this royal STANDARD. Therefore he adds,
<Q>the intere&s;t, and e&s;&s;ential RULE for a king, is to <HI>&s;tudy</HI> the intere&s;t of the nation; to be ever in it; to be always pur&s;uing it:</Q>
This will lay &s;uch a de|gree of confidence in HIM, that he will ever be &s;afe in the PEOPLE, while they <HI>feel</HI> they are &s;afe in him; and not a moment longer. So that if the king of England is not happy, let him thank him&s;elf for it&punc; It is not his people's <HI>fault</HI>&mdash;it is his OWN For that king is not worthy to reign, that does not make the RIGHTS of his people the rule of all his actions&punc; Knowing this, that HE receives all his <HI>power,</HI> and <HI>maje&s;ty,</HI> from them; and how can he think that he has any right to <HI>rule</HI> over them, unle&s;s he rules in their <HI>hearts</HI> by inviolable maintaining their RIGHTS? For as the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel (when in their pro|per place) are no otherwi&s;e than the people's <HI>&s;er|vants,</HI> &s;o the king is no more than the &s;ervant of
<PB N="19" REF="013015_0017_0F8FB075858E16B0">
the people: And when, at any time, he is unfaith|ful, as the people <HI>Servant,</HI> they have a right to &s;ay to him, "give an account of thy <HI>&s;teward&s;hip,</HI> that thou maye&s;t be no longer <HI>&s;teward.</HI> For what can he judge, when a free, and an affectionate people, lay their <HI>grievances,</HI> with <HI>tears,</HI> at his feet, praying, for years pa&s;t, for redre&s;s? and yet he will not hear them!!! Or if he does, he an&s;wers them, like <HI>Rehoboham</HI>&mdash;ROUGHLY: What can he expect, but <HI>Rehoboham</HI>'s revolution?
<Q>what part have we in <HI>David</HI>? Or what portion have we in the &s;on of <HI>Je&s;&s;e</HI>? Every man to thy tent, O I&s;rael.</Q>
And therefore, the pious bi&s;hop further ob&s;erves,
<Q>that a <HI>Prince</HI> that would command the affections, and prai&s;e of the nation, &s;hould not &s;tudy to <HI>stretch</HI> his prerogative;</Q> here I think the pious bi&s;hop mi&s;&s;ed it, for it is not his prerogative, but the people's; and this is what makes it &s;o <HI>un&s;ufferable,</HI> and <HI>unbear|able,</HI> that the king &s;hould make u&s;e of their <HI>power,</HI> and <HI>prerogative,</HI> to de&s;troy their <HI>rights:</HI>
This <HI>Charles Steward</HI> did, and he fell into the hands of wicked men, and they cut of his head for it.</P>
<P>But to proceed to the words of the Text.
<Q>That they may do evil with both hands earne&s;tly; the Prince a&s;keth, and the Judge a&s;keth, for a reward, and the great man he uttereth his mi&s;chievovs de|&s;ire:</Q> So they wrap it up.</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervation the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is then plain that a craving, ab&s;olute <HI>Prince,</HI> is a great di&s;tre&s;s to a people.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="013015_0018_0F8FB075C258C8C8">THE Prince <HI>a&s;keth</HI>! What does he a&s;k for? Why the tall pine trees, for ma&s;ts for his great &s;hips; well, let him have them, not as his right, no, but as your gift to him Well, but the prince a&s;keth? Well, what does he a&s;k now? Why, that the briti&s;h &s;treets may be paved with american gold; well do not make a word about that? let him have it, but let it be in the fair way of trade, and commerce, not by taxation, and oppre&s;&s;ion. The e&s;&s;ence of mo|ney, lies, in what money buys. This, England can furni&s;h you with.</P>
<P>BUT the Prince <HI>asketh?</HI> Well what is it? will he never have done a&s;king? What does he <HI>ask</HI> now? Have patience, and you &s;hall hear, well what is it? Why it is the favour of the government of Rhode-I&s;land, to hold a court of <HI>admiralty</HI> to authorize them to confine &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, (guilty or not guilty) and drag them away three thou&s;and miles, to take their trial by a jury of &s;trangers, if not enemies. But the granting of this in &s;ome mea&s;ure depends upon the con&s;ent of the governor. But all governors (who are worthy the name) are &s;uch as the &s;cripture de&s;cribes Judges 5.9. "My heart, &s;ays one, nay eve|ry American will &s;ay the &s;ame, is towards the go|vernours who offer them&s;elves willingly among the people," to rule by their laws, to defend the rights of the people, to protect their per&s;ons, to &s;ecure their liberties. And this is (we hear) the happi|ne&s;s, power and bulwark of Rhode-I&s;land govern|ment. For its &s;afety lies in this, that the <HI>Governor</HI> of the province, and the judges of the &s;uperior court, the repre&s;entatives of the people, and general <HI>a&s;&s;em|bly,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="013015_0019_0F8FB076866D91A0">
are &s;olemnly bound by oath, to rule, govern and decide, and determine ONLY by their own laws; if &s;o, they have a right to tell the <HI>prince,</HI> that though he <HI>asketh</HI> yet he will a&s;k in vain. Once more,</P>
<P>BUT the prince <HI>a&s;keth,</HI> what now does he a&s;k? Will he never have done a&s;king? Well, but what does he a&s;k? Why he <HI>asketh,</HI> the women, the <HI>wives</HI> upon the goverment of Rhode-I&s;land, to &s;pare their hu&s;bands from their <HI>beds</HI> from their <HI>bo&s;oms,</HI> from their <HI>arms,</HI> and from their children; to be confin'd in the horrid kingdom of a Man-of-War's crew; to be tran&s;ported back again to the <HI>tyranny</HI> their forfathers fled from, to a land of <HI>&s;nares, and the &s;ha|dow of death.</HI> This may be thought to be har&s;h lan|guage, and by the mini&s;try, a HARD <HI>&s;aying who can bear it</HI>? But it is not a hair's breadth more in mean|ing, than the intended power and tyranny of this new court of admiralty. And will you not &s;ubmit to it? No! that is right; I am glad of it, but per|haps, it may be thought rather hard, when a prince asketh, not to grant &s;o &s;mall a favour.</P>
<P>BUT the text likewi&s;e &s;ays&mdash;The <HI>Judge asketh for a reward.</HI> The judges have the key of the laws, the hearts of the <HI>lawyers,</HI> and the power of <HI>juries,</HI> too much in their own hands. The lives of the people, the rights of the &s;ubject, and the di&s;po&s;al of their property, was originally intended to be determined by <HI>juries</HI> only. But as the Judges have a&s;&s;umed by cu&s;tom, a power of dictating to lawyers even at the <HI>bar,</HI> and a direction to the <HI>jury</HI>; it highly becomes them more than ever, to be <HI>men fearing God and
<PB N="22" REF="013015_0020_0F8FB0773277D878">
hating covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Therefore it is an ill &s;ound to hear that the <HI>Judge a&s;keth for a reward,</HI> what can it be for? &s;ure it cannot be fot freeing the <HI>King-&s;treet murderers,</HI> or pleading that it was only man&s;laughter, if he k&mdash;w that it was wilful murder. No doubt but this act of kindne&s;s will be rewarded, if not at the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t, which &s;ome de|&s;pi&s;e; yet at the bar of God, when he &s;hall &s;ay, ari&s;e ye dead and come to judgment: Then there will be no &s;etting a&s;ide a witne&s;s in Mr. P&mdash;ms ca&s;e, nor no other. Again the text &s;aith,</P>
<P>THE Judge <HI>asketh for a reward</HI>! Well, what re|ward is it, a reward from the crown of Britain? if &s;o, not to let him have it, by no means: For if once the judges of the courts of <HI>judicatory</HI> of this pro|vince become dependent for their &s;upport, or &s;ala|ries, upon the favour of the crown, or mini&s;try at Home, you become a nation of &s;laves to mini&s;terial power; for thereby you &s;ubmit the key of all your e&s;&s;ential rights as Americans, to be in the hands of your enemies: For if you &s;uffer the judges to become dependent for their pay upon the mini|&s;try, of England, what are they but the <HI>mini&s;try</HI>'s &s;ervants. If &s;o, you may naturally &s;uppo&s;e, they mu&s;t do as the mini&s;try directs them; if not, they will be unfaithful &s;ervants, and if faithful to the mi|ni&s;try, where then are your rights? Where is the &s;ecurity of your lives, or your property. For a more bolder, daring innovation upon your right of power, dici&s;ion and determination by your own laws, re&s;pecting your right and property between man and man, between the crown of England, and the rights of America, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be made, or
<PB N="23" REF="013015_0021_0F8FB0781F79FBC0">
attempted to be made, than to make your judges dependent upon the briti&s;h mini&s;try; it is in effect, giving up your <HI>right</HI> to all you have, to all that you, or your children can ever po&s;&s;e&s;s. As the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a per&s;on's right, whether heriditary, or by pur|cha&s;e, depends much upon the determination of the judges. And if the judges are wholly to be depen|dent upon the crown of England, for nomination and &s;upport, then you may ea&s;ily judge who&s;e &s;er|vants and &s;laves you are to be. For it is well known, that the judges, or general courts, or &s;ome-body, has for the&s;e hundred years, and more, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed their brethren in their e&s;tates, and in their con&s;ciences, by impo&s;ing payment for mini&s;ters, and for a wor&s;hip of GOD contrary to the people's con&s;ciences; and if they have done the&s;e things in the green tree, what may you not expect in the dry.</P>
<P>BUT as the text &s;ays, The <HI>Judge asketh for a re|ward.</HI> If it be for his fidelity in his high office, for his honourable &s;upport, according to the dignity of his character. You are bound in duty, in affection, and in obedience to let him have it. Shew your affection, readine&s;s and gratitude, to reward your judges, as the guardians of your rights; as tho&s;e who from their hearts, &s;hould protect and hand forth the liberties of their brethren to them. This is the way to become a <HI>band of brethren,</HI> from the governor, to the meane&s;t &s;ubject. Perhaps the whole of your complaint in this re&s;pect, is owing for want of your taking an earlier opportunity, to &s;ettle &s;uch &s;alaries, as their merit, labour, and expence de&s;erves.</P>
<P>YET let not this lead us from the ob&s;ervation, which was, that, an a&s;king, craving, ab&s;olute prince,
<PB N="24" REF="013015_0022_0F8FB07AA496BAD0">
is a great di&s;tre&s;s to a people. Was not this the ca&s;e of the people in King <HI>Ahaz,</HI> and in King <HI>Ahab</HI>'s day, when he crav'd Naboth's vineyard? Likewi&s;e in Jereboham's days, who deprived the people of their religious liberties, in wor&s;hipping the God of I&s;rael, in his temple at Jeru&s;alem? who &s;et up his <HI>golden calves</HI> at <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Bethel,</HI> of whom it is &s;aid, <HI>this</HI> is <HI>Jeroboam</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Nebat,</HI> who <HI>taught I&s;rael to &s;in.</HI> Was not this the ca&s;e in Zedekiah's days&punc; though he was warned by the word of the Lord, and by the prophet of the GOD of I&s;rael? Yet he was, notwith&s;tanding, ab&s;olute and craving, though he was told, it would end in the de&s;truction of him&s;elf, and his people. Was not this the cau&s;e of almo&s;t all the di&s;tre&s;s, deaths, and blood&s;hed, that have ever happened in England &s;ince the conque&s;t of <HI>Julian Cae&s;ar</HI>? their King's ruling, and reigning, by a di&s;potic power, which they a&s;&s;um'd, contrary to the laws, and rights of the people. Were not the Britons obliged by the love of liberty, to obtain their royal <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> &s;word in hand, from King John&punc; Was not this the ca&s;e in the reign of Charles the fir&s;t, when the people and parliament took up arms, to maintain the rights and laws of the people; and when it required either the head of the King, or the lo&s;s of their liberties? they &s;oon decided the matter; they &s;oon let the king know that they rever'd their rights, and liberties above his life, power, and pre|rogative. In Charles the &s;econd's reign, there was much the &s;ame ab&s;olute power over the rights of the people, both civil and religious: But he had a pecu|liar politene&s;s of temper in plea&s;ing even his very enemies. In James the third's reign, di&s;potic power
<PB N="25" REF="013015_0023_0F8FB07B34E2BDF8">
was too evident, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing for the people to bear; therefore a revolution, both of king, and &s;tate, by the &s;pirit, power, and arms, of the people, was &s;oon accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The &s;econd ob&s;ervation is,</P>
<P>THAT when the king, judges, and &s;enates, unite to de&s;troy the rights of the people by a di&s;potic pow|er, or, as the text expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>that they may do evil with both hands,</HI> then the pro&s;perity of the nation <HI>totters</HI>; the Crown &s;hakes; and the de&s;truction of the people's rights is near at hand. For the rights of the people, which is the &s;upreme glory of the crown and kingdom of Britain, is the Magna <HI>Charta</HI> of the king as well as the people; it is as much his pre|viledge, as it is his glory, to maintain their rights; and he is as much under a law, (I mean the law of the rights of the people.) as the people are under the oath of allegiance to him. And therefore what|ever power de&s;troys their <HI>rights,</HI> de&s;troys at the &s;ame time, his right to reign, or any right to his kingdom, crown, or glory; nay, his right to the name of a king among the people. Was not this the ca&s;e in <HI>Rehoboham</HI>'s days, when the people were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with large and heavy taxations, and oppre&s;&s;ions? they petitioned the king to relieve them from &s;uch op|pre&s;&s;ions, but would he hearken to them, according to the advice of his father's coun&s;ellors? No! but according to the advice of his young Coun&s;el, he an&s;wered them like an arbritrary prince in the &s;peech of his di&s;potic mini&s;try, roughly, <HI>My father cha&s;ti&s;ed you with whips, but I will cha&s;ti&s;e you with &s;corpions</HI>: But, would the people bear this oppre&s;&s;ion? No! <HI>What part,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>have we in David? Or what
<PB N="26" REF="013015_0024_0F8FB07BC1014360">
portion in the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e? To thy tents, Oh I&s;rael.</HI> Was not this the ca&s;e in <HI>Zedekiah</HI>'s reign? And was not this lately the ca&s;e in <HI>Sweeden,</HI> when the King with a few of his Senates, and mini&s;try, about him, de&s;troyed the rights of the people, by the power of the &s;word, and e&s;tabli&s;hed his de&s;potic will as the law of the land, by the tyranny of death?</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervation the third.</P>
<P>THIS &s;hews, that an arbitrary di&s;potic power in a prince, is the ruin of a nation, of the King, of the crown, and of the &s;ubjects; therefore it is to be fear|ed, <HI>abhorred,</HI> dete&s;ted and de&s;troyed, becau&s;e the happine&s;s of the King, and the pro&s;perity of the people are thereby, not only in danger, but upon the brink of de&s;truction. Every age and every hi&s;tory, furni&s;hes us with proofs, as clear as the light of the morning of the truth of this.</P>
<P>BUT it is the &s;ingular happine&s;s of the Americans, according to their own laws, not to be in bondage to any power upon the earth. The King of England, has no power to enact, or put in force any law that may oppre&s;s them, his very attempting to do it, at once de&s;troys his right to reign over them For the brighte&s;t Gem which the king of England wears, in the briti&s;h crown, is that maje&s;ty, tru&s;t, and con|fidence, which the Americans inve&s;t him with as the king and guardian of their rights, and liberties.</P>
<P>THE Parliament of England cannot ju&s;tly make any laws to oppre&s;s, or defend the Americans, for they are not the repre&s;entatives of America and there|fore they have no legi&s;lative power either for them, or again&s;t them.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e of Lords cannot do it, for they are
<PB N="27" REF="013015_0025_0F8FB07C84186A88">
Peers of England, not of America; and, if neither king, lords, nor commons, have any right to oppre&s;s, or de&s;troy, the liberties of the Americans, why is it then, that the americans do not &s;tand upon their own &s;trength, and &s;hew their power, and importance, when the life of life, and every liberty that is dear to them and their children is in danger.</P>
<P>Therefore, let me addre&s;s you with all the power of affection, with all the pathos of &s;oul, as one who e&s;teems the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the rights of the Americans, as the highe&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of this life&mdash;to &s;tand alarm'd! See your danger,&mdash;death is near,&mdash;de&s;truction is at the door&mdash;Need I &s;peak? Are not your harbours blockaded from you? Your ca&s;tle &s;ecured by cap|tives&mdash;your lives de&s;troyed&mdash;revenues impo&s;ed upon you&mdash;taxation laid&mdash;military power oppre&s;&s;ing&mdash;your CHARTER <HI>violated</HI>&mdash;your G&mdash;'s heart not right&mdash; your con&s;titution is declining&mdash;your liberties depart|ing, and not content with this, they now attack the <HI>life,</HI> the &s;oul and <HI>capitol</HI> of all your liberties&mdash;to chu&s;e your judges, and make them independent upon you for office or &s;upport, and erect new courts of admi|ralty to take away by violence, the hu&s;band from his family, his wife, his home, his friends, and his all, through a &s;cene, le&s;s joyful than <HI>Pluto</HI>'s horrid king|dom. To be confin'd, and tried for his life, by the accu&s;ation of a negro.</P>
<P>HAS not the voice of your father's blood cry'd yet loud enough in your ears, in your hearts? "ye &s;ons of America &s;corn to be &s;laves" Have you not heard the voice of blood in your own &s;treets, louder than that which reached to Heaven, that cry'd for ven|gence, that was, &s;aith the Lord to Cain, the voice
<PB N="28" REF="013015_0026_0F8FB07DC2CCCC00">
of thy brother's blood, of only one, but this of many brethren. Therefore, if there be any vein, any nerve, any &s;oul, any life or &s;pirit of liberty in the &s;ons of <HI>America,</HI> &s;hew your love for it; guard your freedom, prevent your chains ; &s;tand up as one man for your liberty; for none but tho&s;e, who &s;et a ju&s;t value up|on this ble&s;&s;ing, are worthy the enjoyment of it.</P>
<P>Which leads me to the fifth ob&s;ervation, which is,</P>
<P>THAT it is not rebellion. I declare it before GOD, the congregation and all the world, and I would be glad if it reach'd the ears of every Briton, and every American; That it is no rebellion to oppo&s;e any King, mini&s;try, or governor, that de&s;troys by any violence or authority whatever, the rights of the people. Shall a man be deem'd a rebel that &s;up|ports his own rights? it is the fir&s;t law of nature, and he mu&s;t be a rebel to GOD, to the laws of nature, and his own con&s;cience, who will not do it. A right to the ble&s;&s;ing of freedom, we do not receive from Kings, but from Heaven, as the breath of life, and e&s;&s;ence of our exi&s;tence; and &s;hall we not pre&s;erve it, as the beauty of our being. Do not the birds of the air expand their wings? the fi&s;h of the &s;ea their &s;ins? and the worm of the earth turn again when it is trod upon? And it be deem'd rebellion? Heaven forbid it! Shall <HI>Naboth</HI>'s di&s;puting with King <HI>Abab,</HI> re&s;pecting his vineyard, be deem'd rebellion? Or the people &s;ending home their governor in irons &s;ome years ago, be deemed rebellion? It is no more re|bellion, than it is to breathe.</P>
<P>Sixthly, to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>THAT when the rights and liberties of the people are de&s;troyed, it is commonly by the mi&s;chievous
<PB N="29" REF="013015_0027_0F8FB07E0AF0D7A0">
<HI>de&s;ign</HI> of &s;ome great man. The text &s;ays, <HI>the great man uttereth his mi&s;chievous de&s;ire</HI>: But who this great man is, we do not certainly know, but may &s;hrewdly gue&s;s; but whether Lord Bute, Duke of Grafton, or Lord Hil&s;borough, is not &s;o material, but the <HI>mi&s;chievous de&s;ign,</HI> is what we fear, is what we feel, if they in&s;till in the King's mind a divine right of authority to command his &s;ubjects; this is <HI>mi&s;chievous.</HI> King Charles found it &s;o; Rehoboham found it &s;o, and &s;o will our pre&s;ent King, if he hear|kens to &s;uch advice.</P>
<P>IF they make the name of the King &s;acred, I hope they mean a political &s;acredne&s;s: If &s;o, he is no more &s;acred than the people have made him, by inve&s;ting him with the &s;acred tru&s;t of their rights. If any great man, or the whole mini&s;try makes u&s;e of the king's Name, or his authority, to enforce their ar|bitrary will, as a law to the &s;ubjects, that the &s;ubjects mu&s;t obey, and pa&s;&s;ively &s;ubmit? becau&s;e, &s;ay they, it is his maje&s;ty's will and plea&s;ure: This is <HI>a mi&s;chievous de&s;ign</HI>&mdash;mi&s;chievous to the dignity of the crown&mdash; to his maje&s;ty's per&s;on&mdash;to his &s;ecurity&mdash;to his fami|ly&mdash;and their &s;afety. It is likewi&s;e mi&s;chievous to his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, as it &s;preads di&s;cord, di&s;union and di&s;affection to the king, to his authority, and power, which is a mournful con&s;ideration, and is the bane of all our national di&s;tre&s;s. The people in Eng|land, and the people in America, would fain love their King, and obey him with reverence, and affecti|on, and make him the mo&s;t happy prince upon the earth, if he would but prevent this <HI>mi&s;chievous de&s;ign</HI> of the ruin of their <HI>e&s;&s;ential rights,</HI> and <HI>liberties.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the text &s;ays,
<Q>The great man be uttereth his
<PB N="30" REF="013015_0028_0F8FB07EC2E38C38">
mi&s;chievous de&s;ire,</Q>
&mdash;and indeed we believe he does, in the <HI>clo&s;et,</HI> in the <HI>cabinet,</HI> and in the ears of the King. Oh! it is a mi&s;chievous de&s;ign; too deep for us to fathom, or come to the bottom of, it carries in it the plain a&s;pect of di&s;tre&s;s to the king, and di&s;truction to the people Oh! kind heaven, prevent what king and people have too much cau&s;e to fear; however, at the be&s;t, it is a mi&s;chievous <HI>de&s;ign</HI> to alienate (by any direction, or dictation) the affections of his maje|&s;ty's good &s;ubjects; as it de&s;troys the bonds, and ties, of national ble&s;&s;ings; their rights; their liberties; their lives; their properties: And if this is not a mi&s;chievous de&s;ign there can &s;carce be one found out of the deeps of the dark man&s;ions.</P>
<P>BUT to return to you, my dear Americans, you think hard to pay duties for <HI>teas,</HI> imports, clearances, <HI>entries,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c But what will you farmers and land|holders think, of paying a fixed tax for every acre of land you enjoy, for every apple tree you rear, for every barrel of cyder you make, for every pound of candles you burn, for every pound of &s;oap you u&s;e, for every pair of &s;hoes you wear, for the light of the morning, and the &s;un, that a kind heaven gives you, what do you think of paying a continual tax for all the&s;e, this is contain'd in the mi&s;chievous de&s;ign, &s;tand a|larm'd, O ye Americans&mdash;But I clo&s;e with the la&s;t remark from the text. <HI>So they wrap it up.</HI> It will do, it will do &s;ay they. The King, &s;ay they, has a right to appoint judges, courts of admiral|ties, impo&s;e revenues, lay taxes, &s;erd military forces, block up their harbours, command them&mdash;compel them by arms&mdash;pay their judges&mdash; get the key of their laws, rights and liberties into
<PB N="31" REF="013015_0029_0F8FB07F73769750">
our hands, this will do! <HI>and &s;o they wrap it up,</HI> as fine and &s;mooth as can be: But I think it is better to <HI>unwrap</HI> it again. What do you think, my dear Ame|ricans? But I add no more&mdash;but advi&s;e you, as it is a day of public thank&s;giving, to ble&s;s GOD for the liberties and mercies you do enjoy; not for tho&s;e you are deprived of&mdash;my &s;econd advice is, love your king, pray for him, pray for your governor, pray for your judges, that all their reign may be ea&s;y to them&s;elves, and happy for the people.</P>
