<HEAD>A SPEECH INTENDED to have been SPOKEN on the BILL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT is of &s;uch great importance to compo&s;e or even to mode|rate di&s;&s;entions, which &s;ub&s;i&s;t at pre&s;ent between our unhappy country and her colonies, that I cannot help endeavouring, from the faint pro&s;pect I have of con|tributing &s;omething to &s;o good an end, to overcome the inex|pre&s;&s;ible reluctance I feel at ut|tering my thoughts before the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of all audiences.</P>
<P>The true object of all our deli|beration on this occa&s;ion, which I hope we &s;hall never lo&s;e &s;ight of, is a full and cordial reconciliati|on with North America. Now I own my Lords, I have many doubts whether the terrors and puni&s;hments, we hang out to them at pre&s;ent, are the &s;ure&s;t means of producing this reconci|liation. Let us at lea&s;t do this ju&s;tice to the people of North America, to own, that we can all remember a time when they were much better friends than at pre&s;ent to their mother country. They are neither our natural nor our determined enemies. Be|fore the Stamp Act, we con&s;ider|ed them in the light of as good &s;ubjects as the natives of any county in England.</P>
<P>It is worth while to enquiry by what &s;teps we fir&s;t gained their affection, and pre&s;erved it &s;o long; and by what conduct we have lately lo&s;t it. Such an en|quiry may point out the means of re&s;toring peace, and make the u&s;e of force unnece&s;&s;ary again&s;t a people, whom I cannot yet for|bear to con&s;ider as our brethren.</P>
<P>It has always been a mo&s;t ar|duous ta&s;k to govern di&s;tant pro|vinces, with even a tolerable ap|pearance of ju&s;tice. The vice|roys and governors of other na|tions are u&s;ually temporary ty|rants, who think them&s;elves ob|liged to make the mo&s;t of their time; who not only plunder the people, but carry away their &s;poils, and dry up all the &s;ources of commerce and indu&s;try. Tax|ation in their hands, is an un|limited power of oppre&s;&s;ion: but in whatever hands the pow|er of taxation is lodged, it im|plies and includes all other pow|ers. Arbitrary taxation is plun|der authori&s;ed by law: It is the &s;upport and the e&s;&s;ence of ty|ranny; and has done more mi&s;|chief to mankind, than tho&s;e other three &s;courges from hea|ven, famine, pe&s;tilence and the &s;word. I need not carry your Lord&s;hips out of your own know|ledge, or out of your own domi|nions, to make you conceive what mi&s;ery this right of taxa|tion is capable of producing in a

provincial government. We need only recollect that our countrymen in India, have in the &s;pace of five or &s;ix years, in virtue of this right, de&s;troyed, &s;tarved and driven away more inhabitants from Bengal, than are to be found at pre&s;ent in all our American Colonies; more than all tho&s;e formidable num|bers which we have been nur&s;ing up for the &s;pace of 200 years, with &s;o much care and &s;ucce&s;s, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all Europe. This is no exaggeration, my Lords, but plain matter of fact, collected from the accounts &s;ent over by Mr. Ha&s;tings, who&s;e name I mention with honour and veneration. And I mu&s;t own, &s;uch accounts have very much le&s;&s;ened the plea&s;ure I u&s;ed to feel in thinking my&s;elf an Eng|li&s;hman. We ought &s;urely not to hold our colonies totally inex|cu&s;able for wi&s;hing to exempt them&s;elves from a grievance, which has cau&s;ed &s;uch unexam|pled deva&s;tation; and, my Lords, it would be too di&s;graceful to our&s;elves, to try &s;o cruel an ex|periment more than once. Let us reflect, that before the&s;e inno|vations were thought of, by fol|lowing the line of good conduct which had been marked out by our ance&s;tors, we governed North America with mutual benefit to them and our&s;elves It was a happy idea, that made us fir&s;t con&s;ider them rather as in&s;tru|ments of commerce than as ob|jects of government. It was wi&s;e and generous to give them the form and the &s;pirit of our own con&s;titution; an a&s;&s;embly in which a greater equality of re|pre&s;entation has been pre&s;erved than at home; and councils and governors, &s;uch as were adapted to their &s;ituation, though they mu&s;t be acknowledged to be very inferior copies of the dignity of this Hou&s;e, and the Maje&s;ty of the Crown.</P>
<P>But what is far more valuable than all the re&s;t, we gave them liberty. We allowed them to u&s;e their own judgment in the management of their own inter|e&s;t. The idea of taxing them never entered our heads. On the contrary they have experi|enced our liberality on many public occa&s;ions: we have given them bounties to encourage their indu&s;try, and have demanded no return but what every &s;tate ex|act from its colonies, the advan|tages of an exclu&s;ive commerce, and the regulations that are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure it. We made requi&s;itions to them on great occa&s;ions, in the &s;ame manner as our princes formerly a&s;ked benevolences of their &s;ubjects; and as nothing was a&s;ked but what was vi&s;ibly for the public good, it was always granted: and they &s;ometimes did more than we expected. The matter of right was neither di&s;puted, nor even con&s;idered. And let us not forget that the people of New-England were them&s;elves, during the la&s;t war, the mo&s;t forward of all in the national cau&s;e; that every year we voted them a con|&s;iderable &s;um, in acknowledg|ment of their zeal and their &s;er|vices; that in the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ceeding war, they alone enabled us to make the treaty of Aix la Cha|pelle, by furni&s;hing us with the only equivalent for the towns that were taken from our allies in Flanders; and that in times of peace, they alone have taken from us &s;ix times as much of our woollen manufactures, as the
<PB N="4" REF="013615_0004_0F905A8419EE5610">
whole kingdom of Ireland. Such a colony, my Lords, not only from the ju&s;tice, but from the gratitude we owe them, have a right to be heard in their de|fence; and if their crimes are not of the mo&s;t inexpiable kind, I could almo&s;t &s;ay, they have a right to be forgiven.</P>
<P>But in the times we &s;peak of, our public intercour&s;e was car|ried on with ea&s;e and &s;atisfacti|on. We regarded them as our friends and fellow-citizens, and relied as much upon their fideli|ty as on the inhabitants of our own country. They &s;aw our power with plea&s;ure; for they con&s;idered it only as their pro|tection. They inherited our laws, our language, and our cu&s;|toms; they preferred our manu|factures, and followed our fa&s;hi|ons with a partiality, that &s;ecur|ed our exclu&s;ive trade with them more effectually than all the re|gulations and vigilance of the cu&s;tom hou&s;e. Had we &s;uffered them to enrich us a little longer and to grow a little richer them|&s;elves, their men of fortune, like the We&s;t-Indians, would undoubt|edly have made this country their place of education and re|&s;ort. For they looked up to Eng|land with reverence and affection, as to the country of their friends and ance&s;tors. They e&s;teemed and they called it their home, and thought of it as the Jews once thought of the Land of Canaan.</P>
<P>Now, my Lords, con&s;ider with your&s;elves what were the chains and ties that united this people to their mother country, with &s;o much warmth and affection, at &s;o amazing a di&s;tance. The co|lonies of other nations have been di&s;contented with their treat|ment, and not without &s;ufficient cau&s;e; always murmuring at their grievances, and &s;ometimes breaking out into acts of rebel|lion. Our &s;ubjects at home, with all their rea&s;ons for &s;atisfaction, have never been entirely &s;atis|fied. Since the beginning of this century we have had two rebellions, &s;everal plots and con|&s;piracies; and we our&s;elves have been witne&s;&s;es to the mo&s;t dan|gerous exce&s;&s;es of &s;edition. But the provinces in North-America have engaged in no party, have excited no oppo&s;ition; they have been utter &s;trangers even to the name of Whig and Tory. In all changes in all revolutions, they have quietly followed the fortunes and &s;ubmitted to the government of England.</P>
<P>Now let me appeal to your Lord&s;hips as to men of enlarged and liberal minds, who have been led by your office and rank to the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory. Can you find in the long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, in the whole extent of hu|man affairs, a &s;ingle in&s;tance, where di&s;tant provinces have been pre&s;erved in &s;o flouri&s;hing a &s;tate, and kept at the &s;ame time in &s;uch due &s;ubjection to their mother country? My Lords, there is no in&s;tance; the ca&s;e never exi&s;ted before. It is per|haps the mo&s;t &s;ingular phaeno|menon in all civil hi&s;tory: and the cau&s;e of it well de&s;erves your &s;erious con&s;ideration. The true cau&s;e is, that a mother country never exi&s;ted before, who placed her natives and her colonies on the &s;ame equal &s;ooting; and joined with them in fairly carry|ing on one common intere&s;t.</P>
<P>You ought to con&s;ider this, my Lords, not as a mere hi&s;torical fact, but as a mo&s;t important and
<PB N="5" REF="013615_0005_0F905A855A789898">
invaluable di&s;covery. It enlarg|es our ideas of the power and energy of good government be|yond all former examples; and &s;hews that it can act like grava|tation at the greate&s;t di&s;tances. It proves to a demon&s;tration that you may have good &s;ubjects in the remote&s;t corners of the earth, if you will but treat them with kindne&s;s and equity. If you have any doubts of the truth of this kind of rea&s;oning, the experi|ence we have had of a different kind will entirely remove them.</P>
<P>The good genius of our coun|try had led us to the &s;imple and happy method of governing free|men, which I have endeavoured to de&s;cribe. Our mini&s;ters re|ceived it from their predece&s;&s;ors, and for &s;ome time continued to ob&s;erve it; but without knowing its value. At length, pre&s;uming on their own wi&s;dom, and the quiet di&s;po&s;ition of the Ameri|cans, they flattered them&s;elves that we might reap great advan|tages from their pro&s;perity by de&s;troying the cau&s;e of it. They cho&s;e in an unlucky hour to treat them as other nations have tho't fit to treat their colonies; they threatened and they taxed them.</P>
<P>I do not now enquire whether taxation is matter of right; I only con&s;ider it as matter of ex|periment; for &s;urely the art of government it&s;elf is founded on experience. I need not &s;ugge&s;t what were the con&s;equences of this change of mea&s;ures. The evils produced by it were &s;uch as we &s;till remember and &s;till feel. We &s;uffered more by our lo&s;s of trade with them than the wealth flowing in from India was able to recompence. The bankrupt|cy of the Ea&s;t India Company may be &s;ufficiently accounted for by the rapine abroad and the knavery at home; but it certain|ly would have been delayed &s;ome years, had we continued our commerce with them in the &s;in|gle article of tea. But that and many other branches of trade have been diverted into other channels, and may probably ne|ver return intire to their old cour&s;e. But what is wor&s;t of all, we have lo&s;t their confidence and friend&s;hip; we have ignorantly undermined the mo&s;t &s;olid foun|dation of our own power.</P>
<P>In order to ob&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t impartiality, it is but ju&s;t for us to enquire what we have gained by the&s;e taxes as well as what we have lo&s;t. I am a&s;&s;ured that out of all the &s;ums rai&s;ed in America the la&s;t year but one, if the ex|pences are deducted, which the natives would el&s;e have di&s;charg|ed them&s;elves, the net revenue paid into the Trea&s;ury to go in aid of the &s;inking fund, or to be employed in whatever public &s;er|vices parliament &s;hall think fit, is eighty five pounds. Eighty|five pounds, my Lords, is the whole equivalent, we have receiv|ed for all the hatred and mi&s;|chief, and all the infinite lo&s;&s;es this kingdom has &s;uffered during that year in her di&s;putes with North America. Money that is earned &s;o dearly as this, ought to be expended with great aeconomy. My Lords, were you to take up but one thou&s;and pounds more from North America upon the &s;ame terms, the nation it&s;elf would be a bankrupt. But the mo&s;t amazing and the mo&s;t alarming circum&s;tances is &s;till behind. It is that our ca&s;e is &s;o incurable, that all this experi|ence has made no impre&s;&s;ion up|on us. And yet, my Lords, if
<PB N="6" REF="013615_0006_0F905A85E11DFB48">
you could but keep the&s;e facts, which I have ventured to lay be|fore you, for a few moments in your minds, (&s;uppo&s;ing your right of taxation to be never &s;o clear) yet <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> you mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily perceive that it cannot be exerci&s;ed in any manner that can be advantageous to our&s;elves or them. We have not always the wi&s;dom to tax our&s;elves with propriety; and I am confident we could never tax a people at that di&s;tance, without infinite blunders and infinite opere&s;&s;ion. And to own the truth, my Lord, we are not hone&s;t enough to tru&s;t our&s;elves with the power of &s;hift|ing our own burthens upon them. Allow me, therefore, to conclude, I think, unan&s;werably, that the inconvenience and di&s;|tre&s;s we have felt in this change of our conduct, no le&s;s than the ea&s;e and tranquility we formerly found in the pur&s;uit of it, will force us, if we have any &s;en&s;e left, to return to the good old path we trod in &s;o long, and found it the way of plea&s;antne&s;s.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire to have it under&s;tood, that I am oppo&s;ing no rights that our legi&s;lature may think proper to claim: I am only comparing two different methods of govern|ment. By your old rational and generous admini&s;tration, by treating the Americans as your friends and fellow-citizens, you made them the happie&s;t of hu|man kind; and at the &s;ame time drew from them, by com|merce, more clear profit than Spain has drawn from its mines; and their growing numbers were a daily increa&s;ing addition to your &s;trength. There was no room for improvement or altera|tion in &s;o noble a &s;y&s;tem of poli|cy as this. It was &s;anctified by time by experience, by public <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. I will venture to u&s;e a bold language, my Lords; I will a&s;&s;ert, that if we had uniformly adopted this equitable admini|&s;tration in all our di&s;tant pro|vinces as far as circum&s;tances would admit, it would have placed this country, for ages, at the head of human affairs in eve|ry quarter of the world My Lords, this is no vi&s;ionary or chi|merical doctrine. The idea of governing provinces and colo|nies by force is vi&s;ionary and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. The experiment has often been tried and it has never &s;ucceeded. It ends infal|libly in the ruin of the one coun|try or the other, or in the la&s;t degree of wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>If there is any truth, my Lords, in what I have &s;aid, and I mo&s;t firmly believe it all to be true: let me recommend it &s;o you to re&s;ume that generous and bene|volent &s;pirit in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of our differences, which u&s;ed to be the &s;ource of our union. We certainly did wrong in taxing them: when the Stamp Act was repealed, we did wrong in laying on other taxes, which tended only to keep alive a claim that was mi&s;chievous, impracticable and u&s;ele&s;s. We acted contrary to our own principles of liberty, and to the generous &s;entiments of our &s;overeign, when he de&s;ir|ed to have their judges depen|dant on the crown for their &s;ti|pends as well as their continu|ance It was equally unwi&s;e to wi&s;h to make the governors, in|dependant of the people for their &s;alaries. We ought to con&s;i|der the governors not as &s;pies in|tru&s;ted with the management of our intere&s;t, but as the &s;ervant of the people, recommended to
<PB N="7" REF="013615_0007_0F905A8892BAA998">
them by us. Our ears ought to be open to very complaint again&s;t the governors; but we ought not to &s;uffer the governors to complain of the people. We have taken a different method, to which no &s;mall part of our difficulties are owing. Our ears have been op|en to the governors and &s;hut to the people. This mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily lead us to countenance the jobbs of intere&s;ted men, under the pretence of defending the rights of the crown. But the people are certainly the be&s;t judges whether they are well governed; and the crown can have no rights incon&s;i&s;tent with the happine&s;s of the people.</P>
<P>Now, my Lords, we ought to do what I have &s;ugge&s;ted, and many things more, out of pru|dence and ju&s;tice, to win their affection, and to do them public &s;ervice. If we have a right to go|vern them, let us exert it for the true ends of governments. But, my Lords, what we ought to do, from motives of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, is much more than is &s;uffi|cient to being them to a rea&s;ona|ble accommodation. For thus, as I apprehend, &s;tands the ca&s;e. They petition for the repeal of an act of parliament, which they complain of as unju&s;t and op|pre&s;&s;ive. And there is not a man among&s;t us, not the warme&s;t friend of admini&s;tration, who does not &s;incerely wi&s;h that act had never been made. In fact, they only a&s;k for what we wi&s;h to be rid of. Under &s;uch a di&s;|po&s;ition of mind. one would im|agine there could be no occa&s;ion for fleets and armies to bring men to a good under&s;tanding But, my Lords, our difficulty lies in the point of honour. We mu&s;t not let down the dignity of the mother-country; but pre&s;erve her &s;overeignty over all the parts of the Briti&s;h Empire. This language has &s;omething in at that &s;ounds plea&s;ant to the earn of Engli&s;hmen, but is otherwi&s;e of little weight. For, &s;ure my Lords, there are methods of mak|ing rea&s;onable conce&s;&s;ions, and yet without injuring our dignity. Mini&s;ters are generally fruitful in expedients to reconcile diffi|culties of this kind, to e&s;cape the embara&s;&s;ment of forms, the com|petition of dignity and prece|dency; and to let cla&s;hing rights <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, while they tran&s;act their bu&s;ine&s;s. Now, my Lords, on this occa&s;ion can they find no excu&s;e, no pretence, no inventi|on, no happy turn of language, not one colourable argument for doing the greate&s;t &s;ervice, they can ever render to their country? It mu&s;t be &s;omething more than incapacity that makes men bar|ren of expedients at &s;uch a &s;ea|&s;on as this Do, but for once, remove this impracticable &s;tate|line&s;s and dignity and treat the matter with a little common &s;en&s;e and a little good humour, and our reconciliation would not be the work of an hour But after all, my Lords, if there is any thing mortifying in undoing the errors of our mini&s;ters, it is a mortification we ought to &s;ubmit to. If it was unju&s;t to tax them, we ought to repeal it for their &s;akes; if it was unwi&s;e to tax them, we ought to repeal it for our own. A matter &s;o trivial in it|&s;elf as a three penny duty upon tea, but which has given cau&s;e to &s;o much national hatred and reproach, ought not to be &s;uffer|ed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t an unnece&s;&s;ary day. Mu&s;t the intere&s;t, the commerce and the union of this country and her colonies, be all of them &s;a|crificed to &s;ave the credit of one
<PB N="8" REF="013615_0008_0F905A88ADD02A28">
imprudent mea&s;ure of admini|&s;tration? I own I cannot com|prehend that there is any digni|ty either in being in the wrong, or in per&s;i&s;ting in it. I have known friend&s;hip pre&s;erved and affection gained, but I never knew dignity lo&s;t, by the can|did acknowledgement of an er|ror. And, my Lords, let me ap|peal to your own experience of a few years backward (I will not mention particulars, becau&s;e I would pa&s;s no cen&s;ures and re|vive no unplea&s;ant reflections) but I think every candid mini|&s;ter mu&s;t own, that admini&s;tra|tion has &s;uffered in more in&s;tan|ces than one, both in intere&s;t and credit, by not chu&s;ing to give up points, that could not be defended.</P>
<P>With regard to the people of Bo&s;ton, I am free to own that I neither approve of their riots nor their puni&s;hment. And yet if we inflict it as we ought, with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that we were our|&s;elves the aggre&s;&s;ors, that we gave the provocation, and that their di&s;obedience is the fruit of our own imprudent and imperi|ous conduct, I think the puni&s;h|ment cannot ri&s;e to any great degree of &s;everity.</P>
<P>I own my Lords, I have read the report of the Lords Commit|tees of this hou&s;e, with very dif|ferent &s;entiments from tho&s;e with which it was drawn up. It &s;eems to be de&s;igned, that we &s;hould con&s;ider their violent mea&s;ures and &s;peeches, as &s;o ma|ny determined acts of oppo&s;ition to the &s;overeignty of England, ari&s;ing from the malignity of their own hearts. One would think the mother country had been totally &s;ilent and pa&s;&s;ive in the progre&s;s of the whole affair. I on the contrary con&s;ider the&s;e violences as the natural effects of &s;uch mea&s;ures as ours on the minds of freemen. And this is the mo&s;t u&s;eful point of view, in which government can con&s;ider them. In their &s;ituation, a wi&s;e man would expect to meet with the &s;tronge&s;t marks of pa&s;&s;ion and imprudence, and be prepar|ed to forgive them. The fir&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t thing to be done is to correct our own errors; and I am confident we &s;hould find it the mo&s;t effectual method to cor|rect theirs. At any rate let us put our&s;elves in the right; and then if we mu&s;t contend with North America, we &s;hall be una|nimous at home, and the wi&s;e and the moderate there will be our friends. At pre&s;ent we force every North American to be our enemy: and the wi&s;e and the moderate at home, and tho&s;e im|men&s;e multitudes, which mu&s;t &s;oon begin to &s;uffer by the mad|ne&s;s of our rulers, will unite to oppo&s;e them. It is a &s;trange idea we have taken up, to cure their re&s;entments by increa&s;ing their provocations; to remove the effects of our own ill conduct, by multiplying the in&s;tances of it. But the &s;pirit of blindne&s;s and infatuation is gone forth. We are hurrying wildly on with|out any fixed de&s;ign, without any important object. We pur|&s;ue a vain phantom of unlimit|ed &s;overeignty, which was not made for man; and reject the &s;olid advantages of a moderate, u&s;eful and intelligible authority. That ju&s;t God, whom we have all &s;o deeply offended, can hard|ly inflict a &s;everer national puni&s;hment, than by committing us to the natural con&s;equences of our own conduct. Indeed, in my opinion a blacker cloud ne|ver hung over this I&s;land.</P>

To rea&s;on con&s;i&s;tently with the principles of ju&s;tice and na|tional friend&s;hip, which I have endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h, or ra|ther to revive what was e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by our ance&s;tors, as our wi&s;e&s;t rule of conduct for the govern|ment of America; I mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily di&s;approve of the Bill before us; for it contradicts every one of them. In our pre|&s;ent &s;ituation every act of the le|gi&s;lature, even our acts of &s;everi|ty ought to be &s;o many &s;teps to|wards the reconciliation we wi&s;h for. But to change the govern|ment of a people, without their con&s;ent, is the highe&s;t and mo&s;t arbitrary act of &s;overeignty, that one nation can exerci&s;e over ano|ther. The Romans hardly ever proceeded to this extremity even over a conquered nation, till its frequent revolts and in&s;urrecti|ons had made them deem it in|corrigible The very idea of it im|plies a mo&s;t total and abject, &s;lavi&s;h dependency in the inferior &s;tate. Recollect that the Americans are men of like pa&s;&s;ions with our|&s;elves, and think how deeply this treatment mu&s;t affect them. They have the &s;ame veneration for their Charters, that we have for our Magna Charta, and they ought in rea&s;on to have greater. They are the title deeds to all their rights both public and pri|vate. What? my Lords, mu&s;t the&s;e rights never acquire any legal a&s;&s;urance and &s;tability? Can they derive no force from the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of near two hundred years? And mu&s;t the fundamental con&s;titution of a powerful &s;tate, be forever &s;ub|ject to as capricious alterations as you may think fit to make, in the charters of a little mercan|tile company or the corporation of a borough? This will un|doubtedly furni&s;h matter for a more pernicious debate than has yet been moved. Every other colony will make the ca&s;e its own. They will complain that their rights can never be a&s;cer|tained; that every thing belong|ing to them depends upon our arbitrary will; and may think it better to run any hazard, than to &s;ubmit to the violence of their mother country, in a matter in which they can &s;ee neither mo|deration nor end.</P>
<P>But let us coolly enquire, what is the rea&s;on of this unheard of innovation. Is it to make them peaceable? My Lords, it will make them mad. Will they be better governed if we introduce this change? Will they be more our friends? The lea&s;t that &s;uch a mea&s;ure can do, is to make them hate us. And would to God, my Lords, we had govern|ed our&s;elves with as much oeco|nomy, integrity and prudence as they have done. Let <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> continue to enjoy the liberty our fathers gave them. Gave them, did I &s;ay? They are co-heirs of liberty with our&s;elves; and their portion of the inheritance has been much better looked after than ours. Suffer them to en|joy a little longer that &s;hort pe|riod of public integrity and dome&s;tic happine&s;s, which &s;eems to be the portion allotted by Pro|vidence to young ri&s;ing &s;tates. In&s;tead of hoping that their con|&s;titution may receive improve|ment from our &s;kill in govern|ment, the mo&s;t u&s;eful wi&s;h I can form in their favour is, that hea|ven may long pre&s;erve them from our vices and our politics.</P>
<P>Let me add farther, that to make any changes in their go|vernment,
<PB N="10" REF="013615_0010_0F905A8A15D73790">
without their con&s;ent would be to tran&s;gre&s;s the wi&s;e&s;t rules of policy, and to wound our mo&s;t important intere&s;ts. As they increa&s;e in numbers and in riches, our comparative &s;trength mu&s;t le&s;&s;en. In another age, when our power has begun to lo&s;e &s;omething of its &s;uperiority, we &s;hould be happy if we could &s;upport our authority by mutual good will and the habit of com|manding; but chiefly by tho&s;e original e&s;tabli&s;hments, which time and public honour might have rendered inviolable. Our po&s;terity will then have rea&s;on to lament that they cannot avail them&s;elves of tho&s;e trea&s;ures of public friend&s;hip and confidence which our fathers had wi&s;ely boarded up, and we are throw|ing away. 'Tis hard, 'tis cruel, be&s;ide: all our debts and taxes, and tho&s;e enormous expences which are multiplying upon us every year, to load our unhappy &s;ons with the hatred and cur&s;es of North America. Indeed, my Lords, we are treating po&s;terity very &s;curvily. We have mort|gaged all the lands; we have cut down all the oaks; we are now trampling down the fences, root|ing up the &s;eedlings and &s;amp|lers, and ruining all the re&s;our|ces of another age. We &s;hall &s;end the next generation into the world, like the wretched heir of a worthle&s;s father, without mo|ney, credit or friend; with a &s;tripped, incumbered, and per|haps untenanted e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Having &s;poke &s;o largely again&s;t the principle of the bill, it is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to enter in|to the merits of it. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that even if we had the con&s;ent of the people to alter their government, it would be unwi&s;e to make &s;uch alterations as the&s;e. To give the appoint|ment of the governor and coun|cil to the crown, and the di&s;po|&s;al of all places, even of the judges, and with a power of re|moving them, to the governor, is evidently calculating with a view to form a &s;trong party in our favour. This I know has been done in other colonies; but &s;till this is opening a &s;ource of perpe|tual di&s;cord, where it is our in|tere&s;t always to agree. If we mean any thing by this e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, it is to &s;upport the govern|or and the council again&s;t the people, i e. to quarrel with our friends, that we may plea&s;e their &s;ervants. This &s;cheme of go|verning them by a party is not wi&s;ely imagined, it is much too premature, and at all events, mu&s;t turn to our di&s;advantage. If it fails, it will only make us contemptible; if it &s;ucceeds, it will make us odius. It is our in|tere&s;t to take very little part in their dome&s;tic admini&s;tration of government, but purely to watch over them for their good. We never gained &s;o much by North-America as when we let them go|vern them&s;elves, and were con|tent to trade with them and to protect them. One would think, my Lords, there was &s;ome &s;tatute law, prohibiting us, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, to profit by experience.</P>
<P>My Lords, I have ventured to lay my thoughts before you, on the greate&s;t national concern that ever came under your deli|beration, with as much hone&s;ty as you will meet with from abler men, and with a melancholy a&s;|&s;urance, that not a word of it will be regarded. And yet, my Lords, with your permi&s;&s;ion, I
<PB N="11" REF="013615_0011_0F905A8AD3B0B1F8">
will wa&s;te one &s;hort argument more on the &s;ame cau&s;e, one that I own I am fond of, and which contains in it, what I think, mu&s;t affect every generous mind. My Lords, I look upon North-America as the only great nur&s;ery of free men now left upon the face of the earth. We have &s;een the liber|ties of Poland and Sweden &s;wept away, in the cour&s;e of one year, by treachery and u&s;urpation. The free towns in Germany are like &s;o many dying &s;parks, that go out one after another; and which mu&s;t all be &s;oon exting|ui&s;hed under the de&s;tructive great+ne&s;s of their neighbours. Hol+land is little more than a great trading company, with luxurious manners, and an exhau&s;ted re|venue; with little &s;trength and with le&s; &s;pirit. Switzerland alone is free and happy within the narrow inclo&s;ure of its rocks and vallies. As for the &s;tate of this country, my Lords, I can only refer my&s;elf to your own &s;ecret thoughts. I am di&s;po&s;ed to think and hope the be&s;t of public Liberty. Were I to de&s;|cribe her according to my own ideas at pre&s;ent, I &s;hould &s;ay that &s;he has a &s;ickly countenance, but I tru&s;t &s;he has a &s;trong con&s;titu|tion</P>
<P>But whatever may be our fu|ture fate, the greate&s;t glory that attends this country, a greater than any other nation ever ac|quired, is to have formed and nur&s;ed up to &s;uch a &s;tate of hap|pine&s;s, tho&s;e colonies whom we are now &s;o eager to butcher. We ought to cheri&s;h them as the immortal monuments of our pub|lic ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom; as the heirs of our better days, of our old arts and manners, and of our expiring national virtues. What work of art, or power, or public utility has ever equalled the glo|ry of having peopled a continent without guilt or blood&s;hed, with a multitude of free and happy common wealths; to have given them the be&s;t arts of life and go|vernment; and to have &s;uffered them under the &s;helter of our authority, to acquire in peace the &s;kill to u&s;e them. In com|pari&s;on of this, the policy of go|verning by influence, and even the pride of war and victory are di&s;hone&s;t tricks and poor con|temptible pageantry.</P>
<P>We &s;eem not to be &s;en&s;ible of the high and important tru&s;t which providence has committed to our charge. The mo&s;t pre|cious remains of civil liberty, that the world can now boa&s;t of, are lodged in our hands; and God forbid that we &s;hould vio|late &s;o &s;acred a depo&s;it. By en|&s;laving your colonies, you not on|ly ruin the peace, commerce, and the fortunes of both coun|tries; but you extingui&s;h the faire&s;t hopes, &s;hut up the la&s;t a&s;ylum of mankind. I think, my Lords without being weakly &s;u|per&s;titions, that a good man may hope that heaven will take part again&s;t the execution of a plan which &s;eems big, not only with mi&s;chief, but impiety.</P>
<P>Let us be content with the &s;poils and de&s;truction of the ea&s;t. If your Lord&s;hips can &s;ee no im|propriety in it, let the plunderer and the oppre&s;&s;or &s;till go free But let not the love of lib<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="4 letters"> be the only crime you think <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> thy puni&s;hment.

No nation has ever before con|trived, in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time without any war or public ca|lamity (unle&s;s unwi&s;e mea&s;ures may be &s;o called) to de&s;troy &s;uch ample re&s;ources of commerce, wealth and power, as of late were ours, and which, if they had been rightly improved, might have rai&s;ed us to a &s;tate of more hon+ourable and more permanent greatne&s;s than the world has yet &s;een.</P>
<P>Let me remind the noble Lords in admini&s;tration, that before the &s;tamp act, they had power &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all the ju&s;t ends of government, and they were all compleatly an&s;wered. If that is the power they want, though we have lo&s;t much of it at pre&s;ent, a few kind words would recover it all.</P>
<P>But if the tendency of this bill is, as I own it appears to me, to acquire a power of governing them by influence and corrupti|on; in the fir&s;t place my Lords, this is not true government, but a &s;ophi&s;ticated kind, which coun|terfeits the appearance, but with|out the &s;pirit or virtue of the true: and then, as it tends to deba&s;e their &s;pirits and corrupt their manners to de&s;troy all that is great and re&s;pectable in &s;o con|&s;iderable a part of the human &s;pecies and by degrees to gather them together with the re&s;t of the world. under the yoke of univer&s;al &s;lavery; I think, for tho&s;e rea&s;ons, it is the duty of every wi&s;e man, of every hone&s;t man, and of every Engli&s;hman, by all lawful means, to oppo&s;e it.</P>
