<P>The doctrine to be noted is this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>It is the &s;tatute of Heaven, it is the law of the great God, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a murderer &s;hall be put to death.</P>
<P>I. My purpo&s;e is, to prove the doctrine.</P>
<P>II. Then con&s;ider, that GOD is the rightful Lord, Lawgiver, and &s;upreme Governor of all worlds.</P>
<P>III. Then view the rea&s;onablene&s;s and recti|tude, holine&s;s and goodne&s;s of GOD's laws, and moral government.</P>
<P>And then apply the whole, agreable to the day, and &s;olemn occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I. I am to prove, that it is the &s;tatute of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">a|ven, the law of GOD, that a murderer &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> put to death.

<P>II. I am to con&s;ider, that GOD is the rightful Lord, Lawgiver, and &s;upreme governor of all worlds. For where we find a law, and penalty annexed, it &s;uppo&s;es authority, and right of go|vernment. Now, we are to view GOD's ab&s;olute authority to enact laws, and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;upreme king for|ever.</P>
<P N="1">1. JEHOVAH is by nature GOD, an ab&s;olutely perfect being, the creator and proprietor of the

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">niver&s;e, and is therefore the ab&s;olute Lord of all, and the government of all things devolves upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, for the kingdom is the Lord's, and he go|verns among the nations; and it is his ab&s;olute right, as GOD, to take his &s;eat at the head of the univer&s;e, and conduct all affairs in his own worlds; and the divine government doth extend univer&s;ally; it reaches to the highe&s;t heavens; and divine controul to the lowe&s;t hell: thro' all the natural, and all the moral world; and it is a mat|ter of joy, <HI>that</HI> the LORD GOD reigneth.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider GOD is infinitely equal to the pro|vince of univer&s;al government; the divine per|fections are infinite, and GOD's character ab&s;o|lutely perfect; the infinite knowledge and wi&s;|dom of GOD, can form the mo&s;t perfect plan of government; and infinite holine&s;s, ju&s;tice, and goodne&s;s, holding the reins: every affair is con|ducted in the be&s;t, wi&s;e&s;t, and mo&s;t perfect man|ner: &s;o there is an infinite propriety that GOD &s;hould reign, and be king for ever; from the con|&s;ideration of the divine qualifications, and that all worlds, and created beings, &s;hould be his ab&s;o|lute property.</P>
<P N="3">3. Therefore GOD the rightful lawgiver, hath an infinite authority to enact laws, and govern in his moral kingdom; for if GOD mo&s;t-high, has a right of government, then, he has an infi|nite authority to enact laws; for to &s;uppo&s;e a right of government, and not authority to make laws, nor demand obedience, nor annex a penalty, is to cut all the &s;inews of government; but as all moral created beings, are GOD's workman&s;hip,</P>

Great &s;inners have found mercy, the crucifiers of Chri&s;t, (&s;ome of them at lea&s;t) were wa&s;hed in that blood which they &s;hed, and the dying thief obtained mercy in &s;ome of his la&s;t, yea, in his dying moments: but tho&s;e repented of their &s;ins, and by faith re|paired to Je&s;us, the only Saviour; <HI>for without re|pentance, there is no remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, and without faith in Chri&s;t, there is no ju&s;tification, nor &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of your &s;in, feel your&punc;guilt, and &s;ee your ruined, peri&s;h|ing and undone e&s;tate, and helple&s;s condition; and as you by nature are totally corrupt and depraved, &s;o you &s;tand in ab&s;olute need of a new heart, and a foundation to be laid in you, by the operation of the holy &s;pirit, for true views, and holy exer|ci&s;es you mu&s;t &s;ee, and have a &s;en&s;e of GOD, of the excellence of his law, and government, and of your vilene&s;s and odiou&s;ne&s;s, by rea&s;on of your &s;in, and &s;ee the ju&s;tice of GOD, in ca&s;ting you

off for ever, and feel your&s;elf righteou&s;ly con|demned. You mu&s;t feel your need of a &s;aviour, and under a &s;en&s;e of the gloriou&s;ne&s;s, and all-&s;uf|ficiency of Chri&s;t, the compleatne&s;s of his atone|ment, and with heart approbation of the glorious way of &s;alvation, and under a deep &s;en&s;e of your unworthine&s;s, guilt and vilene&s;s, with full con|&s;ent of heart, come into this way of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, receive him a Saviour to &s;ave from &s;in, and the puni&s;hment of &s;in, and tru&s;t all the affairs of thy &s;oul in his all-&s;aving hands, &amp; with a bleed|ing heart for &s;in, and hatred of it, give up your|&s;elf to GOD in Chri&s;t, unre&s;ervedly, and for ever.
