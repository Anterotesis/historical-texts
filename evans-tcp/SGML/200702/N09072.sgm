<P>The &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners (excepting Mr <HI>Temple</HI>) have all retired from the town: and we find, on particular enquiry, they have not held a meeting of their board &s;ince the 9th of <HI>March.</HI> How they have di&s;po&s;ed of them&s;elves &s;ince that time we &s;hall here relate.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> is gone to <HI>England:</HI> He &s;ailed the 16th of <HI>March,</HI> and went not only without the leave but, as it is &s;aid, contrary to the minds of his &s;uperiors, &s;ignified to him from home. None but the few, intru&s;ted with the &s;ecret, knew any thing of his going till after the departure of the ve&s;&s;el in which he went.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Paxton</HI> retired to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> four Miles from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and for the mo&s;t part has continued there. He has divers times however vi&s;ited the town &s;ince that retiring.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="011583_0004_0F88E1F274002240">Mr <HI>Hulton</HI> &s;ometime ago purcha&s;ed a place at <HI>Brooklyn,</HI> five Miles from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and has ever &s;ince re&s;ided there.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Burch,</HI> with his wife, has retired to Mr <HI>Hulton</HI>'s who, together with Mr <HI>Burch</HI> (leaving their wives behind them) are now on a tour to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> in the province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> where the la&s;t Account from thence left them. It is now above &s;ix weeks &s;ince a board of Commi&s;&s;ioners was held: and it is utterly uncertain when there will be another.</P>
<P>From their fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment here, to the 11th of <HI>June,</HI> 1768, they held their boards regularly four days every week. They then retired on board the <HI>Romney</HI> man of war, and from thence to the ca&s;tle: for what purpo&s;e, their letters and memorials lately publi&s;hed have &s;ufficiently informed the world. From their re-e&s;tabli&s;hment in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>No|vember</HI> 1763, to the 5th of <HI>March,</HI> 1770, they held their boards in the &s;ame regular manner. Since that time there have been but two board meetings, the la&s;t of which was on the 9th of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>Now what do all the&s;e manoeuvres &s;ince the 5th of <HI>March</HI> indicate? Is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e they indicate any thing le&s;s than a de&s;ign to take occa&s;ion from the outrages and murders committed on the evening of that day by the &s;ol|diers (a&s;&s;i&s;ted perhaps from the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e) to repre&s;ent the town in a di&s;advantageous light? And does not their former conduct render this highly probable? &mdash; Be&s;ides, it is a fact, that depo&s;itions have been taken in a &s;ecret man|ner, relative to that unhappy affair, to the prejudice of the town; and it is no way improbable that Mr <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> is gone home with memorials and letters from the Commi&s;&s;ioners and others, accompanying &s;uch depo&s;itions.</P>
<P>By &s;ome e&s;capes, as well as by what the circum&s;tances above mentioned make probable, a pretty good judgment may be formed of the &s;ub&s;tance of tho&s;e Memorials, Letters, and Depo&s;itions, namely, that the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e was at|tacked &mdash;the revenue che&s;t in danger, but &s;aved by the fir|ing upon the <HI>mob</HI>&mdash;The King's troops compelled to leave the town&mdash;the commi&s;&s;ioners thence obliged for their &s;afety to quit it al&s;o&mdash;the con&s;equent impo&s;&s;ibility of their holding boards&mdash;the detriment thence ari&s;ing to the revenue and his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice&mdash;all government at an end, and the Province in a &s;tate of rebellion.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="011583_0005_0F88E1F4ACF896A8">If the&s;e be, either in whole or in part, the &s;ubjects of the di&s;patches &s;ent home, it is very proper a few ob&s;ervations &s;hould be made upon them.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e attacked&mdash;a fal&s;hood. The people drawn into <HI>King&s;treet,</HI> were drawn thither by the cry of fire, and the outrages of the Soldiers, which occa&s;ioned it. From the fir&s;t appearance of the people in <HI>King&s;treet,</HI> to the time of the firing upon them, there had not pa&s;&s;ed fifteen mi|nutes. It might with as much truth be affirmed, that they made an attack upon the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e in <HI>London,</HI> as upon the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e in <HI>Bo&s;ton:</HI> of which latter there was not even a pane of gla&s;s broken.</P>
<P>The Revenue Che&s;t in danger&mdash;a fal&s;hood. It is not pro|bable the che&s;t is kept at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e: but if it be, there was, and is, at lea&s;t as much danger of it from &s;ome of the out-door people employed under the Commi&s;&s;ioners, as from any body el&s;e. It is certain that &s;ome of them are of an infamous character.</P>
<P>The troops compelled to quit the town&mdash;a fal&s;hood. They quitted the town by the orders of their Commanding Officer, in con&s;equence of a <HI>reque&s;t</HI> from the Lieutenant Governor, who was advi&s;ed by the council to <HI>pray</HI> the &s;aid Officer to remove the troops. This <HI>reque&s;t</HI> and this <HI>prayer</HI> was ob|tained by an application from the town to the Lieutenant Governor. Into what times are we fallen, that the govern|ment of the province is reduced to the humiliating condition of making <HI>&s;uch a prayer!</HI></P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing the troops had been compelled <HI>vi &amp; armis</HI> to quit the town. It would have been a mea&s;ure ju&s;tifiable in the &s;ight of GOD and man. When the Soldiers&punc; &s;ent hither for the declared purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Civil Magi&s;trate to keep the peace, were them&s;elves in a remarkable manner the breakers of the peace&mdash;When, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting, they in&s;ulted him; and re&s;cued offenders of their own corps from ju&s;tice&mdash;when they frequently abu&s;ed the inhabitants in the night&mdash;when they had entered into a combination to com|mit &s;ome extraordinary acts of violence upon the town; and in con&s;equence of it, on the evening of the Ma&s;&s;acre, attack|ed the inhabitants wherever they met them; afterwards firing upon, and killing and wounding a number of them. When all this had been done, and more threatened, it was high time they &s;hould be removed from the town. If there
<PB N="6" REF="011583_0006_0F88E1F642CE1BF0">
had been no other means of getting rid of them, the inha|bitants would have had a right by that law of nature, which &s;uperceeds all other laws, when they come in competition with it&mdash;the law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation&mdash;to have compelled them to quit the town. This law is radical in our nature, indelible from it, and uniformly operating, where it can operate, to the removal or de&s;truction of every thing incom|patible with it; and is abrogable by no other lawgiver than GOD him&s;elf, the great author of it. Therefore, although the re&s;i&s;ting the King's troops in any thing they have a right by law to do, may be adjudged trea&s;on, yet when they act contrary to law, e&s;pecially in &s;o outrageous a manner as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, and retain a di&s;po&s;ition to repeat it, whereby the lives of the King's &s;ubjects are in danger, they then cea&s;e to be the King's troops&punc; that is, they are not the King's troops for any &s;uch purpo&s;e, but &s;o far become trai|tors; and on the failure of other means of riddance from them, which the time and circum&s;tances may make eligible and are lawful, they may (by the principles of all law, as well as by the great law above-mentioned, into which tho&s;e principles are re&s;olvable) be re&s;i&s;ted and expelled: and not to do it, where it can be done, is a &s;pecies of trea&s;on again&s;t the con&s;titution, and con&s;equently trea&s;on in an equal de|gree again&s;t the King, and all his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners obliged for their &s;afety to quit the town&mdash;If one fal&s;hood can be more &s;o than another, this is the greate&s;t yet mentioned, and is as ridiculous as it is fal&s;e. Their conduct and &s;uch a declaration by no means agree. Would they in that ca&s;e occa&s;ionally vi&s;it the town? Would they tru&s;t them&s;elves in the environs of it? Could they think them&s;elves &s;afe at <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Brooklyn?</HI> Could they think them&s;elves &s;afe any where in the province, or indeed in <HI>America?</HI> Mu&s;t they not know, if any evil were really intended them, it might ea&s;ily overtake them any where, and every where on this &s;ide of the <HI>Atlantic?</HI> Some other rea&s;on than their &s;afety mu&s;t therefore be looked for to ac|count for their retiring, and di&s;continuing their boards. A &s;imilar proceeding of theirs in <HI>June,</HI> 1768, and their Letters and Memorials, lately publi&s;hed, give occa&s;ion at lea&s;t to conjecture what that rea&s;on may be. Is it not pro|bable it was to corroborate the &s;aid depo&s;itions, and thence induce admini&s;tration to think it nece&s;&s;ary, not only that
<PB N="7" REF="011583_0007_0F88E1F6F7E91858">
troops already here &s;hould be continued, but that a further number &s;hould be &s;ent to &s;trengthen and &s;upport them? If this mea&s;ure cannot be effected, and &s;hould the Commi&s;|&s;ioners be &s;o unfortunate as to remain here unattacked in the ab&s;ence of the troops, it might naturally be thought they could have remained here without them in 1768; and therefore that they had put the nation to a very great ex|pence, for no other purpo&s;e than further to alienate the affections of the <HI>Americans,</HI> and to give them an additional rea&s;on to wi&s;h them&s;elves independent of it: And hence the Commi&s;&s;ioners might have cau&s;e to expect a national re&s;entment again&s;t them.&mdash;However injurious to us the effects of &s;uch policy may be, we cannot but applaud it (on the principles of the <HI>Machiavilian</HI> &s;y&s;tem) as it &s;tands related to them&s;elves. If they thought their own exi&s;tence in danger, con&s;idered as Commi&s;&s;ioners, how natural was it to u&s;e the means to &s;upport it? And what fault could be found with the means, if tho&s;e principles ju&s;tified them? Why need they trouble their heads about con&s;equences that would not affect them&s;elves? or, if they would, and &s;uch exi&s;tence appeared precarious without tho&s;e means, was it not nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be u&s;ed, and the con&s;equences di&s;regarded?&mdash;If the means be &s;ucce&s;sful to the end for which they &s;eem de&s;igned, it requires no prophetic &s;pirit to foretel that the con&s;equences may be&mdash;bad enough. Whether the pre&s;ent Commi&s;&s;ioners, or any Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners at all (who&s;e appointments are fully equal to any benefit the Nation or Colonies are likely to reap from them, and who&s;e u&s;efulne&s;s hitherto may be valued by &s;ome of the negative quantities in algebra) are <HI>things</HI> of importance enough to hazard tho&s;e con&s;equences, or any ill con&s;equence at all, is humbly &s;ubmitted to the wi&s;dom of admini&s;tration to determine.</P>
<P>The con&s;equent impo&s;&s;ibility of their holding boards&mdash; This impo&s;&s;ibility was of their own creating. If they had continued in town (from whence they had not the lea&s;t rea|&s;on to depart, unle&s;s to an&s;wer purpo&s;es they would choo&s;e to conceal) they might have held their boards as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The detriment thence ari&s;ing to the Revenue, and his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice&mdash;If any &s;uch detriment has ari&s;en, the fault is their own. <HI>His Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice</HI> is a cant term in the mouths of under&s;trappers in office. Many of them ei|ther
<PB N="8" REF="011583_0008_0F88E1F7B9E8A560">
do not know the meaning of it, or abu&s;e it to an&s;wer their own corrupt purpo&s;es. It is u&s;ed to expre&s;s &s;omething di&s;tinct from the &s;ervice of the people. The King and Peo|ple are placed by it in oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts. Whereas, by the happy con&s;titution we are under, the intere&s;t of the King is the intere&s;t of the people, and his &s;ervice is their &s;ervice: both are one, and con&s;titutionally in&s;eparable. They who attempt to &s;eparate them attempt to de&s;troy the con&s;titu|tion. Upon every &s;uch parricide may the vengeance both of King and People de&s;cend.</P>
<P>Government at an end&mdash;This has been the cry ever &s;ince the &s;tamp-act exi&s;ted. If the people &s;aw they were going to be en&s;laved; if they &s;aw Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> (from whom they had a right to expect that he would do nothing to pro|mote it) was zealous and active to rivet the chains; and that <HI>his</HI> government, in its principles and conduct, tended to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a tyranny over them, was it unnatural for them in &s;uch a ca&s;e to reluct? was it unrea&s;onable to re|fu&s;e an acquie&s;cence in &s;uch mea&s;ures? Did an oppo&s;ition to them indicate a di&s;regard to government? If government, in the true idea of it, has for its object the good of the governed, <HI>&s;uch</HI> an admini&s;tration could not be called govern|ment: and an oppo&s;ition to it by no means included an oppo|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="6 letters"> to government. From &s;uch an oppo&s;ition has ari&s;en <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="6 letters">ry, that government is at an end. The &s;ooner <HI>&s;uch</HI> government is at an end the better.</P>
<P>When a people have lo&s;t all confidence in government, it is vain to expect a cordial obedience to it. Hence irre|gularities may ari&s;e, and have ari&s;en. But they will cea&s;e, when the true ends of government are &s;teadily pur&s;ued. Then, and not till then, may it be expected, that men of weight and influence will exert them&s;elves to make go|vernment re&s;pected. Nay, &s;uch exertions will then be needle&s;s, for mankind cannot help re&s;pecting what is in it&s;elf re&s;pectable, e&s;pecially when it is at the &s;ame time &s;o promotive of their own good as good government is.</P>
<P>The province in a &s;tate of rebellion&mdash;Into this &s;tate its enemies, on both &s;ides of the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> have been endeavour|ing to bring it. When they could not make it &s;ub&s;ervient to their intere&s;t and views; and when their mea&s;ures had rai&s;ed a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition to them, that oppo&s;ition was made the lucky occa&s;ion to repre&s;ent the province in a &s;tate
<PB N="9" REF="011583_0009_0F88E1F8B7545268">
of rebellion, or verging towards it. To ju&s;tify &s;uch a re|pre&s;entation the more fully, they endeavoured to drive it into that &s;tate: whereby in the end they might hope to gra|tify both their malice and avarice: their malice, by injuring it mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially; and their avarice, by the &s;ubjection of it to their tyranny and pillage. But nothing can be more fal&s;e than &s;uch a repre&s;entation: nothing more foreign from this people than a di&s;po&s;ition to rebellion. The principles of loyalty were planted in our brea&s;ts too deep to be eradi|cated by <HI>their</HI> efforts, or any efforts whatever: and our in|tere&s;t co-operated with tho&s;e principles.</P>
<P>It is humbly hoped his Maje&s;ty will not be influenced, by <HI>&s;uch</HI> repre&s;entations, to think unfavorably of <HI>his faithful &s;ubjects of this province:</HI> and <HI>that</HI> hope is grounded upon their innocence: of which they have the highe&s;t evidence in their own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; and of which they have given their adver&s;aries no other cau&s;e to doubt, than what ari&s;es from an oppo&s;ition to <HI>their</HI> mea&s;ures. Mea&s;ures, not only ruinous to the province, but hurtful to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and de&s;tructive of the union, and commercial intercour&s;e, which ought always to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between her and her Colonies.</P>
<P>The foregoing Ob&s;ervations appeared nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate the Town and Province from the a&s;per&s;ions &s;o unju&s;tly ca&s;t upon them. The few that follow refer to the pre&s;ent and future &s;tate of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and her Colonies.</P>
<P>HOW happy is <HI>Britain</HI> with regard to &s;ituation, and and many internal circum&s;tances; and in her connec|tion with her Colonies!</P>
<P>Separated from the re&s;t of the world, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o large a naval force, &s;he is &s;ecure from foreign inva&s;ions: her government (well admini&s;tred) is the be&s;t exi&s;ting; her manufactures are exten&s;ive, and her commerce in propor|tion. To the two latter the Colonies have in a con&s;iderable degree contributed. By the&s;e means &s;he has ri&s;en to her pre&s;ent opulence and greatne&s;s, which &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;h her among the powers of <HI>Europe.</HI> But however great and opulent &s;he may be, &s;he is capable of being &s;till more &s;o; and &s;o much &s;o, that &s;he may be deemed at pre&s;ent in a &s;tate of minority, compared with what &s;he will one day
<PB N="10" REF="011583_0010_0F88E1FA5FC1F970">
probably be, if her own conduct does not prevent it. The means of this greatne&s;s are held out to her by the Colonies; and it is in her power, by a kind and ju&s;t treatment of them, to avail her&s;elf of tho&s;e means.</P>
<P>The Coloni&s;ts are hu&s;bandmen, and till lately have ma|nufactured but a &s;mall part of their clothing, and the other articles with which they had been u&s;ually &s;upplied from <HI>Great Britain.</HI> But they have been taught by experience they can &s;upply them&s;elves; and <HI>that</HI> experience (which has been forced upon them) has demon&s;trated mo&s;t clearly, that they have within them&s;elves the means of living con|veniently, if not with elegance, even if their communica|tion with the re&s;t of mankind were wholly cut off. This, however, could not be an eligible &s;tate: but no one in|titled to and de&s;erving the liberties of an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> can he&s;itate a moment to &s;ay, that it would be preferable to &s;lavery; to which the Coloni&s;ts have apprehended them|&s;elves doomed, by the mea&s;ures that have been pur&s;ued by Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>If the Coloni&s;ts might be permitted to follow their in|clinations, with which at the &s;ame time their intere&s;t coin|cides, they would be hu&s;bandmen &s;till, and be &s;upplied as u&s;ual from <HI>Great Britain.</HI> The yearly amount of tho&s;e &s;upplies (as appears by the exports from <HI>Britain</HI>) is very con&s;iderable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The value of the exports from <HI>Britain</HI> to the Colonies in 1766, which was le&s;s than in 1765, &s;tood thus:

Let us therefore take only one quarter part of tho&s;e numbers; and then the value of exports from <HI>Britain</HI> to the Colonies, in 1866, will be more than thirteen millions &s;terling for &s;ixteen mil|lions of Coloni&s;ts. It is highly probable, by <HI>that</HI> time there will be at lea&s;t that number of Coloni&s;ts in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies on this continent. Now, in ca&s;e there be no interruption of the union and harmony that ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between <HI>Great Britain</HI> and her Co|lonies, and which it is their mutual intere&s;t &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t and be maintained, what good rea&s;on can be given why &s;uch exports &s;hould not bear as great a proportion to the number of the Coloni&s;ts as they do at this time? If they &s;hould, the value of &s;uch exports (which will be continually increa&s;ing) will be at lea&s;t thirteen millions <HI>per annum.</HI> A &s;um far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the value of all the ex|ports from <HI>Great Britain</HI> at this day.</P>
<P>In what proportion &s;o va&s;t a trade with the Colonies would en|large the other branches of her trade; how much it would increa&s;e the number of her people, the rents and value of her lands, her wealth of every &s;pecies, her internal &s;trength, her naval power, and particularly her revenue (to enhance which in a trifling degree has occa&s;ioned the pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s between her and the Colonies) are matters left to the calculation and deci&s;ion of the political arithmeticians of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P></NOTE>, and might be in future in proportion to the

increa&s;e of the Coloni&s;ts. Their increa&s;e is rapid: they are daily emigrating from the old towns, and forming new ones; and if they double their numbers every twenty years, as it is &s;aid they will continue to do, &s;o long as they can form into families by procuring the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence at an ea&s;y rate, which probably will be the ca&s;e, till <HI>America</HI> &s;hall be well peopled, there will be in a &s;hort time a prodigious addition to his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects; who, if not compelled to manufacture for them&s;elves, will occa&s;ion a proportion|able demand for the manufactures of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> If it be

con&s;idered too, that <HI>America,</HI> from its different &s;oils and climates, can rai&s;e perhaps all the productions of other countries in the &s;ame latitudes: which being remitted in exchange would mo&s;t of them be rough materials for <HI>Britain</HI> to manufacture; what a fund of wealth and power will <HI>America</HI> be to her! Her inhabitants, of every denomination, by finding employment, and the con&s;equent means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, will greatly encrea&s;e; and her trade and naviga|tion be in proportion. She might then view with indiffe|rence the interdiction of her trade with other parts of the world; though &s;he would always have it in her power, from the &s;uperiority of her naval force, which &s;uch a trade and navigation would enable her to &s;upport, to do her&s;elf ju&s;tice, and command univer&s;al re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Connected with her Colonies, &s;he would then be a mighty empire: the greate&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of people of one language, that ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>If the&s;e ob&s;ervations be not wholly vi&s;ionary, and a mere reverie, they po&s;&s;ibly may not be unworthy the con&s;ideration of Parliament: who&s;e wi&s;dom will determine, whether any revenue whatever, even the greate&s;t that <HI>America</HI> could po&s;|&s;ibly produce, either without or with her good will, would compen&s;ate the lo&s;s of &s;uch wealth and power; or ju&s;tify mea&s;ures that had the lea&s;t tendency to bring them into ha|zard: or whether for &s;uch a revenue it would be worth while to hazard even the pre&s;ent advantages, re&s;ulting to <HI>Great Britain</HI> from an union and harmony with her Colonies.</P>
