<HEAD>THE Other Side of the Que&s;tion: OR, A DEFENCE OF THE LIBERTIES of NORTH-AMERICA, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>A Certain Friendly Addre&s;s to all rea&s;onable Americans, was ju&s;t now put into my hands. Some people perhaps have read it, for I am told it was publi&s;hed &s;ix days ago; where|fore, after peru&s;ing, it &s;eems proper to make a &s;hort an&s;wer to this performance: not becau&s;e it is well written, or becau&s;e there is the lea&s;t danger any man will become a pro&s;elyte to the doctrines con|tained in it; but for the following rea&s;ons, which candor obliges me to mention.</P>
<P>FIRST. I an&s;wer this pamphlet, for the very purpo&s;e which alone the pamphlet it&s;elf is likely to effect,&mdash;to encourage the paper manufactory.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. I an&s;wer it for the &s;ake of the Prin|ter, who mu&s;t be &s;adly out of pocket, by publi&s;h|ing &s;uch woeful performances: And therefore he is
<PB N="4" REF="013381_0003_0F905742C57523F8">
hereby reque&s;ted to print this in a large type, and the like, &s;o as to make the mo&s;t on't.</P>
<P>THIRDLY. I write, becau&s;e from the futility of the author's rea&s;oning, no body el&s;e may think it worth the trouble. And if &s;o, why then he would very naturally conclude that he had written an excel|lent unan&s;werable treati&s;e, which conclu&s;ion might inflate the poor creature's vanity, in &s;uch man|ner as to tempt him into other imprudencies of the &s;ame kind. The public thanks therefore will be my due, for removing, or at lea&s;t preventing a common nu&s;ance.</P>
<P>LASTLY. I am prompted to this undertaking out of regard to the fair-&s;ex. For many weak women may be exceedingly frighted by that awful compound of threats, and texts, and homilies.</P>
<P>Now then, gentle reader, having told thee the origin. I &s;hall next acquaint thee with the charac|ter of this new acquaintance, which my Ma&s;ter James hath introduced to thy hand.&mdash;I will not, as is too common with controver&s;ial people, whether politic, or polemic: I will not, I &s;ay, u&s;e any acrimonious expre&s;&s;ions, again&s;t this unhappy author; for who&s;e weakne&s;&s;es and wanderings, I have the utmo&s;t pity and compa&s;&s;ion. On the contrary, I &s;hall treat him with the greate&s;t gentlene&s;s and re|&s;pect, owing in &s;ome mea&s;ure to my very great reve|rence for the Clergy, one of which he is, as I have been informed. And truly the frequent quotations from &s;cripture, together with the illiberal language contained in his pamphlet, will naturally lead folks to believe &s;o. For it unfortunately happens, that
<PB N="5" REF="013381_0004_0F905742E1D9C198">
the generality of the&s;e Gentlemen, from an ungain habit they acquire by abu&s;ing the poor Devil, are too apt to vilify and a&s;per&s;e their neighbours. Some exceptions there are, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, which may be attributed to this; that a few indivi|duals have kept better company, and &s;een more of the polite world, than the re&s;t of their order. But alack and alas! I fear me our author is not one of the&s;e rare birds, for the hou&s;ehold proverbs and tales with which his piece is interlarded, (if I may venture on &s;omething like his own language) make the odds at lea&s;t a pound to a penny again&s;t him.</P>
<P>And now reader, if by chance thou art a Pre&s;by|terian, or Congregationali&s;t, or other Di&s;&s;enter from the Epi&s;copalian Church, to which I my&s;elf belong; permit me to a pologize for the rude and opprobrious terms made u&s;e of again&s;t you by our author. The&s;e things ought in common charity to be forgiven, in|a&s;much as they &s;eem to have proceeded from igno|rance and the want of better language.&mdash;And do not, I be&s;eech you, conclude too ha&s;tily again&s;t his brethren, I have &s;everal friends and acquaintance among them, who are really Gentlemen. Where|fore it is my earne&s;t de&s;ire, that if in the hurry of compo&s;ition (for I have but three days to write this in the mid&s;t of other affairs) if I &s;ay any thing &s;hould fall from my pen, which can be con&s;trued a reflec|tion on the Clergy, it is my de&s;ire that it &s;hould be in&s;tantly erazed.&mdash;I honour them much for their piety, learning, and &s;trictly loyal attachment to our Sovereign.</P>
<P>An old Mathematician (I think they call him Ar|chimedes) had &s;uch confidence in his art and ma|chines,
<PB N="6" REF="013381_0005_0F9057439A72CC38">
as to declare he would move the earth it&s;elf if he could get a place to &s;tand on. But plea&s;e your wor&s;hips, while he was upon the thing which was to be moved, had he worked his heart out, 'twould not have budged an inch.&mdash;In imitation of this ve|nerable &s;crew-driver, may we not lay down the fol|lowing logical maxim. A man may prove impo&s;&s;i|bilities if you will concede his po&s;tulata.&mdash;Thus, in order to demon&s;trate that black is white, or in other words, that black and white are the &s;ame thing, I a&s;k only this admi&s;&s;ion; that there is no difference between them.</P>
<P>He who in conver&s;ation with half a dozen friends, &s;hould in a &s;imilar manner begin any argument whatever, by affirming the thing to be proved, would he not rai&s;e a laugh at his expence? Now, all Ame|rica contends for rights, which we aver to have been invaded, violated, de&s;troyed, and a certain writer attempts to prove this conte&s;t, trea&s;onable and rebellious; what &s;hall we think of a writer, who begins an addre&s;s on this &s;ubject, not to half a dozen, or half a hundred but to all <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> Americans, with the following propo&s;ition? <Q>Of all the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, tho&s;e who re&s;ide in the American colonies, are and might &s;till be enjoying the benefits of an equitable and free con|&s;titution.</Q> As to his quotation from an "excel|lent writer," it may &s;hew the Gentleman's reading, but can never help his a gument; and therefore I &s;hall pa&s;s it over &s;ilence, to the examination of tho&s;e excellencies, which he him&s;elf hath fabricated.</P>
<P>If by the term, &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, he means &s;ubjects to the King of Great-Britain, and
<PB N="7" REF="013381_0006_0F9057445A6DA7D0">
&s;ubordinate to the Parliament of that Kingdom, it is an inaccuracy, which, con&s;idering what follows, may be ea&s;ily forgiven. But if the&s;e words are in|tended to in&s;inuate, that the people of America are &s;ubject to laws made by the Parliament of Great-Britain, in all ca&s;es whatever, then we &s;hall find, that the fir&s;t ground this great Archimedes intends to fix his rea&s;oning machine on, is what follows. Americans are &s;ubject to the will of a Parliament which they have no vote in choo&s;ing, and being &s;o &s;ubject, enjoy a free and equitable con&s;titution. To which I have only two &s;mall exceptions: fir&s;t, the&s;e are the very points to be proved, and &s;econdly, they involve a flat contradiction. Now then, &s;up|po&s;ing the&s;e things admitted, after all, twi&s;t them and turn them as you plea&s;e, &s;till mu&s;t you come back in a circle to the place from whence you &s;et out; &s;till luckle&s;s Philo&s;opher you grovel on the earth.</P>
<P>Shortly after follows another fal&s;e propo&s;ition. America contributes but a &s;mall proportion to &s;up|port the public expences. This for argument &s;ake, I will grant. I will grant what I &s;uppo&s;e he meant; namely, that America contributes but little to <HI>defray</HI> the public expences which other folks &s;upport. I am not captious in my temper, nor do I mean to cavil about words, for then I &s;hould never have done.</P>
<P>Then comes a page about Mo&s;es, thunder, blind|ne&s;s, darkne&s;s and de&s;truction. As the&s;e things are quite out of my way, I &s;hall not meddle with them; but proceed to the next, the &s;cope of which &s;eems to be this, Whether parliament hath been right
<PB N="8" REF="013381_0007_0F905745AEF9CD78">
or wrong, we are bound by the laws of Heaven to obey its mandates. And in quality of good Chri|&s;tians, we mu&s;t be &s;ubject to the Mini&s;ters, be they who they will, for con&s;cience &s;ake. Let who will be King, our author is Vicar of Bray. To eluci|date all which doctrines he ob&s;erves that if the greate&s;t tyrant on earth Nero for in&s;tance) &s;hould u&s;urp and e&s;tabli&s;h a domination over us, the har&s;he&s;t and mo&s;t cruel, yet &s;o heinous is the offence of di&s;|turbing an e&s;tabli&s;hed government, that a due regard for the rights and liberties of mankind, would prompt us to a peaceable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. To this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion we are enjoined, it &s;eems, by the Chri&s;tian religion; and to di&s;turb or threaten &s;uch a government, is an unpardonable crime, and has been con&s;idered as &s;uch, in every age and nation of the world. All which is mighty rea&s;onable. Wherefore it follows clearly, that tho&s;e per&s;ons who within the&s;e four or five centuries, contended for, and by degrees e&s;ta|bli&s;hed our glorious con&s;titution. <Q>A frame of government, &s;ays our author, which has always been the wonder of the world, under the pro|tection of which, the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain are the happie&s;t people on earth</Q> I &s;ay, tho&s;e per&s;ons who have rendered the&s;e Briti&s;h &s;ubjects &s;o happy, and tran&s;mitted to them all the rights and privileges they enjoy, tho&s;e per&s;ons, according to the above doctrine, mu&s;t be damned to all eternity for their pains.&mdash;This may be religion, I am &s;ure it is not common &s;en&s;e. But be that matter as it will, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to declare, in imitation of hone&s;t Sir Toby; I had rather tru&s;t God Almighty with my &s;oul, than the Briti&s;h Parliament with my e&s;tate. Moreover, for the HONOUR of the Church of Eng|land, I do entreat all other Sectaries to believe, that
<PB N="9" REF="013381_0008_0F90574629F378B0">
very few of its members hold the &s;ame creed with this writer.</P>
<P>However, having introduced Nero, Saint Peter, Saint Paul, and the Grand Turk, in company to|gether; he de&s;cends from his pulpit, leaves the&s;e dignified per&s;onages to &s;hift for them&s;elves, and opens the de&s;ign of his pamphlet: which he tells us, is not religion, <Q>but to con&s;ider how far the con|duct of the colonies is to be condemned or ju&s;ti|fied by the maxims of &s;ound policy and prudence.</Q> For it &s;eems pretty well &s;ettled even in his idea, that notwith&s;tanding that &s;ame Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem he talks of <Q>our temporal intere&s;t and &s;afety, are con&s;idera|tions which all will regard;</Q> in which opinion I do mo&s;t heartily concur with him.</P>
<P>After this follows a little more declamation, which you may &s;ee if you have the pamphlet, if not, &s;end for it to the Book&s;ellers, and you will find a &s;ort of &s;yllogi&s;m to &s;hew; that re&s;entment is unju&s;tifiable, and complaint unrea&s;onable, if our legal rights have not been invaded.&mdash;Legal rights,&mdash;and why that term, legal rights? Do you mean, my Reverend Sir, that any right (that of taxing our&s;elves for in|&s;tance, if it be not confirmed by &s;ome &s;tatute law, is not a legal right; and therefore an inva&s;ion of &s;uch right, will neither ju&s;tify re&s;entment, nor authori&s;e complaint? I am afraid you do,&mdash;and yet I hope not; for this al&s;o is one point to be proved in &s;upport of your hypothe&s;is In the name of America I deny it. But if you mean to &s;peak fairly, and if by <HI>legal rights</HI> you mean what you ought to make your own argument conclu&s;ive, namely, tho&s;e rights which we are entitled to by the eternal laws of right rea&s;on;
<PB N="10" REF="013381_0009_0F905748E826AFC0">
then the remainder of your ta&s;k will be to &s;hew, that our rights have not been invaded, and if that can be done, then to be &s;ure our complaints are ground|le&s;s.</P>
<P>Now then let us &s;ee what the Friendly Addre&s;s &s;ays upon this &s;ubject. Why the fir&s;t ob&s;ervation is, that the duty on tea is no tax; for unle&s;s we pur|cha&s;e it we don't pay the duty, therefore it is quite in our option, whether we will pay it or no. What can be more equitable?&mdash;I remember, about twelve years ago, there was a madman in the Philadelphia ho&s;pital, who imagined him&s;elf monarch of the country thereabouts; and among other wild projects, &s;uch as might be expected from a creature in that &s;ituation, he had one to tax the air. But may it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, will &s;uch a tax be right? Air was always common and free, in the time of your Maje&s;ty's royal progenitors and predece&s;&s;ors. Will not your &s;ubjects think this an arbitrary law, like the poll tax? Arbitrary! cried the prince, enraged; and like the poll tax too! What rebels! Why, un|le&s;s they breathe, they don't pay the duty, therefore it is quite in their option whether they will pay it or no. What can be more equitable. I pitied the poor man becau&s;e he was mad.</P>
<P>But you &s;ay tea is a luxury. In &s;ome re&s;pects it may be &s;o. And how, and where, &s;hall we draw a line, between the luxuries and the conveniences of life? Or by what right can the one be taken away, which will not affect the other? Tho&s;e who may rightfully deprive us of luxuries, by the &s;ame rule may as rightfully deprive us of conveniences too. And if in the plenitude of that power, which our
<PB N="11" REF="013381_0010_0F9057490C8E2068">
author &s;o apo&s;tolically hath conferred, they &s;hould deign to leave unto us the nece&s;&s;aries of life, pray by what &s;tandard &s;hall we determine the&s;e nece&s;&s;aries?</P>
<L>&mdash;Our ba&s;e&s;t beggars,</L>
<L>Are in the poore&s;t things &s;uperfluous.</L>
<L>Allow not nature more than nature needs,</L>
<L>Man's life is cheap as bea&s;t's.</L>
<P>But to return.&mdash;Our author next &s;uppo&s;es, that he is arguing with &s;ome hone&s;t American, who &s;hould deny the right of Parliament to lay this duty on tea. To obviate this he quotes precedent. The Ameri|can is then &s;uppo&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that the precedent it&s;elf was wrong, wherefore no right could originate from it; but that together with other &s;imilar wrongs, it ought to be done away. So is the argument &s;tated by him&s;elf. And he then, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that this tea duty is quite di&s;tinct from a tax at|tempts to &s;hew, that Parliament had a right to levy it, merely as a regulation of trade. Pray read the eighth and and ninth pages&mdash;Have you read them?&mdash;Why now your honour, I will undertake to confute every thing contained there. I will undertake to &s;hew, that the author's rea&s;oning does not apply to his purpo&s;e or &s;ubject, any more than the words Denmark and Ru&s;&s;ia, which as you &s;ee are printed in large Italicks.&mdash;But what will it &s;ignify to take up &s;o much of your attention; when it is very like you had better be thinking on &s;ome other affair. His con&s;equence may be well &s;upported on rational ground; though, to his misfortune, he could not di&s;cover it. The right of Great-Britain to <HI>regulate</HI> the trade of the colonies, &s;hall be admitted.
<PB N="12" REF="013381_0011_0F90574997E31CC0">
But that the duty on tea is a <HI>regulation</HI> of trade and not a tax; this is the very matter in controver&s;y.</P>
<P>We are now arrived at the confutation of one of Mr. Locke's arguments; which, &s;ays our author, "appears to me weak and &s;ophi&s;t cal."&mdash;The argu|ment as quoted by him&s;elf, &s;tands thus: "If parli|ament has a right to take from us one penny with|out our con&s;ent, it has a right to &s;trip us of our whole property." To confute which he ob&s;erves, "A right to do what is rea&s;onable, implies not a right to do what is unrea&s;onable." And after a &s;hort &s;imilitude about father and &s;on, he &s;ays, <Q>Ca&s;es may happen, in which it would be rea&s;onable for Par|liament to take from us &s;ome &s;mall matter, though we were unwilling to part with it; but the ca&s;e can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed, in which it would be rea|&s;onable to take from us every thing, unle&s;s we &s;hould have forfeited it.</Q> And &s;o concludes, "There can be no right to do wrong."&mdash;And this is the confutation.&mdash;I was &s;ome time puzzled to make any thing of it; but by comparing one part with another, we may at lea&s;t gue&s;s that he means what follows: By the words, rea&s;onable to take from us, &amp;c. I pre&s;ume he intends, a right to take from us. For, rea&s;onable, in the proper &s;en&s;e of the word, will not an&s;wer his purpo&s;e at all; becau&s;e if we in|vert the propo&s;ition, it will be as <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> for the Legi&s;lature of this province to take from the people of England, a &s;mall matter without <HI>their</HI> con&s;ent. But that any &s;uch right could exi&s;t, the author of the Addre&s;s would hardly allow. Throughout this admirable confutation therefore, let us &s;ub&s;titute right for rea&s;onable, and wrong for unrea&s;onable, and then it will &s;tand thus: <HI>A right to do what is
<PB N="13" REF="013381_0012_0F90574D16521898">
right, implies not a right to do what is wrong. To take from us one penny without our con&s;ent is right, but to &s;trip us of our whole property is wrong. Therefore, Parliament may have a right to take from us one penny, without our con&s;ent, which is right; but this right does not nece&s;&s;arily imply, that Parliament has a right to &s;trip us of our whole property, which is wrong. Therefore Mr. Locke's argument is confuted.</HI> And in the &s;ame way I will undertake to confute Euclid's Elements, from one end to the other.&mdash;Examine this argument, this fine argument. It re&s;ts upon the a&s;&s;ertion, that in &s;ome ca&s;es Parliament may have a right to take a &s;mall matter from us without our con&s;ent, which a&s;|&s;ertion is the very thing denied. And &s;o the Gentle|man's wits and faculties, after prancing and curvet|ing through a whole &s;ection, bring him not one inch nearer the end of his journey, than he was when he fir&s;t &s;et out.</P>
<P>So here again he labours at a di&s;tinction between the duty on tea, and a tax. But as to any difference between them, that you know is quite another affair. No matter for the difference, provided there be a di&s;tinction. May it plea&s;e your Reverence, when|ever you are at a lo&s;s for matter to vamp up into the &s;hape of another Addre&s;s; I have a dozen or two &s;uch di&s;tinctions, which are very heartily at your Reverence's &s;ervice, very heartily I do a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>Ah! what have we here? Another di&s;&s;ertation on the Briti&s;h right of regulating American trade? Yes. Here it is, hip and thigh, import and export, back &s;troke and fore &s;troke; ble&s;&s;ings on us, I &s;ay. What a pity it is, that our author would not content him|&s;elf with a &s;imple a&s;&s;ertion here, as he has done in
<PB N="14" REF="013381_0013_0F90574E9CC3BD30">
tho&s;e in&s;tances, which really required proof. Mo&s;t unfortunately, in endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h what we would readily grant; he lays his foundation on argu|ments, which would overthrow every principle of American liberty. I declare, reader, it is not my intention to cheat you, by re-printing quotations from the Addre&s;s. But unle&s;s you have bought it, I do not know how otherwi&s;e to manage matters.</P>
<P>The &s;ame want of penetration, which led our author to imagine Mr. Locke's argument weak and &s;ophi&s;tical, now bewilders him with a Jack O'Lant|horn, in the &s;hape of the word Engli&s;hmen. His drift is to &s;hew, we may be bound by laws we do not con&s;ent to, and yet po&s;&s;e&s;s all the rights of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-men. For, &s;ays he, Engli&s;hmen can have no right to be exempted from the authority of an Engli&s;h Parliament. After this he blunders a little about majority and minority, hints at virtual repre|&s;entation, and &s;ays &s;omething of Engli&s;h American ground. To an&s;wer which at once, tho&s;e who do not immediately perceive the fallacy, are de&s;ired to con&s;ider, that the per&s;ons who make laws for Eng|land, are to be bound by them when they have done. And that no exi&s;tence whatever, except Almighty God, can have a natural right to make laws binding on others, which the law-maker is exempt from. True it is &s;uch power may be u&s;urped, or through politi|cal nece&s;&s;ity conceded. U&s;urped as the Briti&s;h power of taxing America, conceded as the power of regu|lating trade, which after &s;uch conce&s;&s;ion, becomes a right. Greater rights they cannot have; unle&s;s &s;ome mode can be invented, to incorporate us into the grand legi&s;lature of the empire, on con&s;titutional principles. But let us examine his Engli&s;h argument.
<PB N="15" REF="013381_0014_0F90574ED98F80B8">
The word Engli&s;h above, is printed in Italicks, and &s;eparated from the word, men. In reading the &s;en|tence, leave out <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the argument is gone. Now I do aver, and will maintain, that to con&s;ent to laws binding upon us, is one of tho&s;e rights which we enjoy as men, and not merely as Engli&s;h|men. In quality of rational and free agents, we enjoy it. A right granted by our Creator, when he formed us of the clod. That great charter by which he confirmed it, may be read in the human frame: A charter &s;ealed with the breath of life. To this right every man is and mu&s;t be entitled; it is annex|ed as an in&s;eperable appendage to our exi&s;tence, and altho' the Engli&s;h law hath &s;ecured it to the Engli&s;h &s;ubject, yet a Frenchman or Turk is as much enti|tled to it, by the law of nature. That this title hath not been ratified by political in&s;titutions, is <HI>his</HI> misfortune, and <HI>I</HI> am &s;orry for it.</P>
<P>So you &s;ee, reader, all this trouble might have been &s;pared, if the poor creature had not mo&s;t un|luckily laid hold of that &s;aid word. Engli&s;h: which indeed from the face of his performance, he does not appear to under&s;tand. The la&s;t part of the ar|gument we are now upon, ari&s;es from a fact I am not inclined to di&s;pute, though I do not believe it. He avers that we have been offered repre&s;entatives in the Common's Hou&s;e, if we would &s;end them over. Be this as it may, I agree with him that we have done wi&s;ely in not accepting the offer if ever it was made. Or in other words, to have accepted it, would have been folly. Now then hear him. "After refu&s;ing it, they have no rea&s;on to complain." That is to &s;ay, becau&s;e we have <HI>not</HI> committed folly, we have no right to complain of inju&s;tice, Yet this is an Addre&s;s to all <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> Americans.</P>

The next attempt of this ma&s;terly Addre&s;s, is to impeach the validity of tho&s;e compacts, which &s;eve|ral colonies have made with the crown. The&s;e com|pacts can be con&s;idered in no other light, than as covenants by the King, in con&s;ideration of &s;ettling the de&s;art; that he would protect the &s;ettlers and their dependants, in the enjoyment of their natural rights. If his Maje&s;ty chu&s;es to withdraw this pro|tection&mdash;be it &s;o. The King can do no wrong. But I wi&s;h there had been a lineal warrantee from his mini&s;ters. Some of them are of noble de&s;cent, and I have &s;o high an opinion of the honour of Briti&s;h Peers, that I believe few of them would infringe &s;uch &s;olemn agreements. However, &s;uppo&s;e the King &s;hould withdraw this protection,&mdash;Are our rights therefore annihilated? No. Tho&s;e rights were conferred by the King of Kings, and no earthly Potentate can take them away.</P>
<P>Not long &s;ince I &s;aw a Letter from a Veteran, to the Officers of the Army at Bo&s;ton: I pray the au|thor to receive my thanks, for the great plea&s;ure enjoyed in the reading of it. I think I could ea&s;ily perceive in it, the traces of that manly, generous, brave, and free di&s;po&s;ition; which mark the charac|ter of the Soldier and the Gentleman.</P>
<L>If, to his &s;hare &s;ome little errors fall,</L>
<L>View his kind heart, and you forgive them all.</L>
<P>I am almo&s;t afraid to return immediately to the Addre&s;s, becau&s;e compari&s;ons are odious. Make none, gentle reader, I be&s;eech thee; but ob&s;erve out author here in&s;inuates, that he hath &s;hewn, "that in reality no proper <HI>right</HI> of the colonies is in|fringed
<PB N="17" REF="013381_0016_0F9057505F4A44E8">
by the late act of Parliament." Pray now, how hath he &s;hewn it? Why by three a&s;&s;ertions, neither of which is in the lea&s;t proved, as I took occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve before in treating of them re&s;pectively.&mdash;The fir&s;t is, that the duty on tea is no tax. The &s;econd, that if a tax, it is a &s;mall one, and Parlia|ment hath a right to take from us a &s;mall matter without our con&s;ent. And the third, that a man may be rightfully bound by laws which he does not, and cannot a&s;&s;ent to.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the main pillars of this formidable argument; not one of which hath the lea&s;t &s;olidity: And therefore the provi|dent author, fearful perhaps of their in&s;tability, before he ven|tures to charge us with &s;edition, privy con&s;piracy and rebellion, to anathemati&s;e us for fal&s;e doctrine, here&s;y, and &s;chi&s;m; or to reproach us for hardne&s;s of heart, and contempt of his word and command; reverts to his original con&s;iderations, about pru|dence and policy, on what he calls the &s;uppo&s;ition, and Ameri|cans the fact, that we have been really injured.</P>
<P>But the&s;e con&s;iderations, do not &s;eem to be well con&s;idered; becau&s;e he takes it for granted in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, that the peo|ple of Bo&s;ton were criminal in de&s;troying the tea. And the word Bo&s;ton, &s;ome how or other fa&s;cinating his imagination, he is hurried away with a torrent of invectives. The de&s;truction of the tea, &s;ays he, <Q>was a compound of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t injury and in&s;ult, an act of the highe&s;t in&s;olence to government, &s;uch as mildne&s;s it&s;elf cannot overlook or forgive.</Q> The only fault of all this and &s;ome more of the &s;ame kind is, that it is rather mi&s;placed; for it would an&s;wer tolerably well in a &s;ermon again&s;t bla&s;phemy.</P>
<P>Let me intreat the reader's attention to a &s;imple tale: Tho&s;e who are inclined to doubt it, will find unque&s;tionable evidence in a pamphlet, called, A true State of the Proceedings in the Parliament of Great-Britain, and in the Province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the year 1761, 1762, 1763, the duteous conduct of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, was exemplary and acknowledged.&mdash;In 1764, the &s;tamp-act was threatened, and a duty impo&s;ed for rai&s;ing a revenue in America. The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives re&s;olved, that it is uncon&s;titutional, to take their money without their con&s;ent. In 1765, the &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies petitioned again&s;t the &s;tamp-act; which they had no right to do, becau&s;e&mdash;<HI>it was a
<PB N="18" REF="013381_0017_0F90575119BC64E8">
Money Bill:</HI> con&s;equently the petitions were di&s;regarded, and the bill was pa&s;&s;ed. The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts then propo&s;ed a Congre&s;s of Delegates from the &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies; and the Congre&s;s petitioned the King: but the Congre&s;s was an uncon|&s;titutional body; wherefore our gracious ma&s;ter (that year) was afflicted with a great deafne&s;s. In 1766, the A&s;&s;embly petitioned again&s;t their Governor, one Francis Bernard, for a&s;&s;uming, with his Council, the powers of legi&s;lation. This accu&s;ation was very ju&s;t, and therefore to make it was ve|ry impertinent. A Non-importation in America, opened the ears of the Parliament in England; and in 1766, the Stamp Act was repealed. In 1767, another revenue act pa&s;&s;ed; whereupon the A&s;&s;embly of that province pre&s;ented a petition at the foot of the throne; and wrote to the other A&s;&s;emblies to join in it, which was a piece of great pre&s;umption. In 1768, the A&s;&s;em|bly was ordered to re&s;cind the re&s;olve, by which tho&s;e letters had been written, on pain of di&s;&s;olution; which peremptory mandate produced a petition, and al&s;o a letter to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate.&mdash;About the &s;ame time &s;ome &s;eamen were pre&s;&s;ed con|trary to an act of parliament; the people of Bo&s;ton petitioned their governor on this affair; but his Excellency had no bu&s;ine&s;s to interfere in the Admiral's department. A ve&s;&s;el al&s;o was &s;eized in a manner which irritated the mob, and they were &s;uch &s;coundrels as to re&s;ent the in&s;ult; con&s;equently they were guil|ty of trea&s;on and rebellion, for drubbing the worthy collector. An army was &s;ent there immediately, but then there was an act of parliament again&s;t quartering them on the people, there|fore the governor i&s;&s;ued his commi&s;&s;ion, to di&s;pen&s;e with the act, for a royal martyr had done &s;o before him. The people then petitioned the governor to call an a&s;&s;embly; this was re|fu&s;ed, for bu&s;ine&s;s could better be done without one. Di&s;ap|pointed in this, they appointed a convention, the members whereof irritated by what they called their wrongs, pre&s;ented another humble petition to the King; wherefore in 1769, the troops, out of a ju&s;t contempt for their pu&s;ilanimity, &s;hot three brace by way of &s;tarting the covey. But it was impo&s;&s;ible his Maje&s;ty's troops could have been the aggre&s;&s;ors; therefore there mu&s;t have been an in&s;urrection of the people. This was clearly the ca&s;e al&s;o from judge Oliver's narration; yet near an hun|dred credible witne&s;&s;es, had the impudence to &s;wear, that his narration was fal&s;e. Con&s;equently to repair the breach in his character, it was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould be appointed Lieute|nant Governor, which happened accordingly. In 1769, the A&s;|&s;embly pre&s;ented another petition, again&s;t their governor Ber|nard.
<PB N="19" REF="013381_0018_0F9057524E9C91F0">
He prorogued the A&s;&s;embly, went to England immedi|ately, obtained an order for a hearing on the petition upon the 28th of February, and got the prorogation of the A&s;&s;embly con|tinued until the 14th of March. Notwith&s;tanding all this, the A&s;&s;embly never &s;upported their charge with any proof; becau&s;e the prorogations rendered it impo&s;&s;ible; con&s;equently the peti|tion was groundle&s;s, vexatious and &s;candalous, as every body will ea&s;ily &s;ee. In the year 1772, 1773, the A&s;&s;embly took the liberty to petition again, which was at lea&s;t forward and ill-bred, wherefore no notice was taken of what they alledged. In De|cember 1773, the dutiable Tea arrived. I have during the cour&s;e of this &s;tory, omitted many things which were thought very grievous by the people of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, for the &s;ake of brevity, and becau&s;e the recital of all their complaints might po&s;&s;ibly inflame mens minds at this dangerous juncture; a thing I would wi&s;h to avoid, for I have great re&s;pect for the clergy.</P>
<P>In December 1773, the dutiable Tea arrived at Bo&s;ton. It was evident that if this commodity was landed, there would be many purcha&s;ers among the governors creatures. Prudence therefore required, that it ought to be &s;ent back. The gover|nor would not permit this, and the nece&s;&s;ity was then clear, either that the Tea mu&s;t be de&s;troyed, or the act &s;ubmitted to. Wearied out with long oppre&s;&s;ion, and driven to de&s;peration by repeated in&s;ults, a few daring men went di&s;gui&s;ed to the &s;hip and de&s;troyed the Tea.&mdash;Upon this tale I &s;hall make no com|ment, it needs none. But to relieve the reader's attention, I will mention an incident of a more lively complexion:&mdash;Two young gentlemen found a cat &s;itting peaceably in one corner of the parlour: She was a gentle animal, and a good mou&s;er. Young men love fun, &s;o they &s;hut the door and windows, and ferreted her about, till &s;he and they were hear|tily tired: At length, in a violent leap from her per&s;ecutors, the cat fell in the mid&s;t of an elegant &s;et of china: to lo&s;e a China cup and &s;awcer, by means of a vile cat, was too much to be patiently borne, and poor pu&s;s was murdered for not &s;cam|pering up the chimney.</P>
<P>Now after this digre&s;&s;ion, let us return to the pamphlet, and &s;ee what is &s;aid about the puni&s;hment of this crime, which mildne&s;s it&s;elf could neither overlook nor forgive. A very mild puni&s;hment &s;ays he, for it was only &s;hutting up the port. Now
<PB N="20" REF="013381_0019_0F905752CAEB45D8">
&s;hutting up the port, was, as we all know, only de&s;troying the trade; and that is only a trifle, as we &s;hall &s;ee by and by. <Q>Surely, (cries our author) none who have as high a &s;en&s;e of public guilt as of private, can think this puni&s;hment too &s;evere for the crime, con&s;idered under all its aggravations. For no people are entitled to the u&s;e of any advantage, which they wantonly abu&s;e to the injury of others.</Q> The&s;e ob&s;ervations are calculated to &s;hew the equity of the port bill; let us &s;ee then, whether our author hath fortunately &s;tumbled upon &s;ound rea&s;on in this in&s;tance, after failing &s;o often.&mdash;The advantage which the Bo&s;tonians are deprived of, is their trade; and there|fore their trade mu&s;t be the thing which they wantonly abu&s;ed. Now, by what figure of &s;peech, the de&s;truction of the Tea can be called a matter of trade, or what kind of trade it is, I am at a lo&s;s to conceive.&mdash;Do not &s;ay, that this is a verbal critici&s;m. Such things I re&s;erve for authors of greater per&s;picuity. The equity of every puni&s;hment depends of its relation to the crime. Now allowing, that the de&s;troyers of the Tea, were guilty of a violent outrageous riot; I &s;hall be glad to know, what kind of relation there is in the nature of things, between a riot commit|ted by thirty or forty men, and the ruin of many hone&s;t trade&s;|men, by a total &s;upen&s;ion of that commerce on which they &s;ub|&s;i&s;t. Yet this is a MILD and a JUST puni&s;hment. I have can|didly exhibited the delinquencies of this people; were I to give them a name, nothing but that love of peace which &s;anctifies every means to obtain it, nothing but that &s;hould prevent me, from branding their conduct as a tamene&s;s under in&s;ults which provoke them.</P>
<P>The next attempt of our worthy pamphleteer is to &s;hew, that <Q>the puni&s;hment of the Bo&s;tonians, was not ha&s;ty and precipi|tate.</Q> He rea&s;ons thus: In common ca&s;es, a criminal ought to be heard; but this is an uncommon ca&s;e; courts of ju&s;tice ought not to condemn unheard, but the legi&s;lature may. Now let us &s;crutinize the intrin&s;ic value of the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions. A fellow &s;teals a &s;heep, or a hor&s;e, or ravi&s;hes your wife, or mur|ders your father. Ju&s;tice holds up on high her equal &s;cales; &s;he cries out aloud to the human heart, let him be heard in his defence; rather ninety-nine guilty e&s;cape, than one innocent peri&s;h: but &s;hould a man burn the tooth-pick of a court mi&s;tre&s;s, or prevent the prime mini&s;ter from pi&s;&s;ing in his pocket, or de&s;troy &s;ome mu&s;ty Tea, to &s;ave his e&s;tate; in &s;uch uncommon ca&s;e, e&s;pe|cially if ninety-nine innocent are to &s;uffer, le&s;t one guilty e&s;cape; in &s;uch uncommon ca&s;e the maxim is, let them not be heard. Do you ask why? The an&s;wer is plain: If &s;uffered to make a defence,
<PB N="21" REF="013381_0020_0F90F4BF3897BF48">
they cannot be convicted.&mdash;So much for the ca&s;e: Now for the tribunal.&mdash;If a man commits any of the crimes fir&s;t mentioned again&s;t the known laws of the land, &s;ubject to a certain penalty, the maxim is, let him be heard. But as to the la&s;t &s;ort, puni&s;h|able by a new law, in a new mode, both framed after the fact committed, policy is of opinion, that they &s;hould not be heard, le&s;t the varlets &s;hould except to her mode of proceedings again&s;t them. All which is addre&s;&s;ed to the <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> Americans.</P>
<P>But (&s;ays he in the next paragraph) to involve the innocent with the guilty, is an inconvenience which always <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> attends puni&s;hments inflicted on a people, whether by God or man. And again, it was <HI>politically</HI> impo&s;&s;ible to &s;elect the inno|cent of Bo&s;ton from the guilty. We all remember the &s;tory of Sodom and Gomorrah. It is an excellent le&s;&s;on to the Princes of the earth. The inhabitants of the&s;e cities, infamous by their vices to the la&s;t degree, became &s;o obnoxious to the Supreme Being, that in anger, he re&s;olved to de&s;troy them. Yet had there been five men, only five men, who walked uprightly before God; had only five &s;uch men dwelt in Sodom and Gomorrah, no fire had de&s;cended from Heaven to con&s;ume them. But alas! Becau&s;e among thirty thou&s;and &s;ouls in Bo&s;ton, thirty have offended; in vain &s;hall the multitude plead innocence, as an exemption from ruin. Blu&s;h Humanity! This is thy political nece&s;&s;ity, which mu&s;t hereafter ju&s;tify the laying that defencele&s;s town in a&s;hes, and drenching it in the blood of its inhabitants.</P>
<L>&mdash;Merciful Heaven!</L>
<L>Thou rather with thy &s;harp, and &s;ulph'rous bolt,</L>
<L>Split'&s;t the unwedgeable, and gnarled oak,</L>
<L>Than the &s;oft myrtle. Yea, but man, proud man!</L>
<L>Dre&s;t in a little brief authority;</L>
<L>Mo&s;t ignorant of what he's mo&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd,</L>
<L>His gla&s;&s;y e&s;&s;ence: Like an angry ape,</L>
<L>Plays &s;uch fanta&s;tick tricks before high Heaven,</L>
<L>As makes the Angels weep.</L>
<P>Becau&s;e thirty have offended, a whole colony is puni&s;hed. And for what offence? An offence &s;o &s;mall, &s;o di&s;proportionately puni&s;hed, that the general voice of the continent hath declared, that they &s;uffer in the cau&s;e of American liberty. Here our au|thor begins to leave the paths of logic, and to enter the alleys of Billing&s;gate. Beneath his forming hand, American liberty &s;tarts forth a mon&s;ter of licentiou&s;ne&s;s. And in his idea, to &s;creen our mi&s;erable fellow-creatures from that PUBLIC JUSTICE
<PB N="22" REF="013381_0021_0F90575415DAE8E0">
which hath been created for them; is giving &s;helter to the raving enthu&s;ia&s;t, who hath murdered his prince.&mdash;Bold metaphors and florid language, are the magnificent trappings of rea&s;on and truth; and when fal&s;hood or folly is thus arrayed, it pro|vokes at once our indignation and contempt.</P>
<P>But neither bold metaphors, nor yet bold language, &s;erve &s;ome cau&s;es &s;o well as bold a&s;&s;ertions. I have heard of lawyers, who by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that invincible front which is the pre|&s;criptive privilege of their profe&s;&s;ion, frame evidence as they go along, and &s;peak fluently on facts which never exi&s;ted. In like manner and in humble imitation, to evince the propriety of the act, for new modelling the government of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets; our author &s;cruples not to affirm, that <Q>no privileges are curtailed by the act, but &s;uch as had been abu&s;ed and forfeited, over and over, to the great injury and di&s;turbance of that province, as well as to the di&s;honour and reproach of the nation.</Q> The in&s;titutions of this act, as to their matter I do not object to; for it hath long been my opinion, that the government of that co|lony was in its form and complection, too like a Republic, for the true &s;pirit of our con&s;titution. But as to the manner; even &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e regulations to be a decree &s;ub&s;tantially ju&s;t, and made by a court having proper juri&s;diction, &s;till there is mani|fe&s;t impropriety.&mdash;It is, and while I have exi&s;tence, it &s;hall be my &s;entiment; that no man, no body of men, in any cau&s;e, before any tribunal, can be legally affected by any determination, where an opportunity is not given, for making a defence. Had this been done in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, perhaps his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters would not have deemed them &s;o criminal, as they now do. But waving this idea, I am &s;ure the author of the Addre&s;s at lea&s;t, after the pointed a&s;&s;ertions he has made, ought in com|mon ju&s;tice to have &s;hewn, how the privileges he &s;peaks of had been <HI>abu&s;ed and forfeited.</HI> This, however he thought it prudent to omit.&mdash;</P>
<P>That Admini&s;tration is irritated with Bo&s;ton, that it hath cau&s;e to be irritated, I freely acknowledge: And <HI>this</HI> is the cau&s;e of the anger they feel, and the revenge they have taken. The people of that town, and the colony it belongs to, have been forward and active, in &s;tating and demanding, their rights and liberties; they have addre&s;&s;ed, petitioned, and remon&s;trated to Mini&s;ters, Parliament, and King; they have &s;ounded the alarm, when the enemy attacked our privileges; and they have been the grand ob&s;tacle to an American tyranny. If to do thus
<PB N="23" REF="013381_0022_0F905754399BE108">
is a forfeiture of privileges; if to do thus is an abu&s;e of them, who would hold &s;uch privileges on &s;uch tenure? Mo&s;t readily do I grant, that it was a di&s;honour and a reproach to the nation, and its rulers too; that they &s;o often made u&s;e of their right to petition and to remon&s;trate. Great was the cau&s;e, or &s;uch fre|quent complaints would not have been obtruded. For this was their guilt, this was their impertinence;&mdash;&s;uffering they com|plained.</P>
<P>We come now to the Quebec Act. On this &s;ubject I &s;hall not minutely follow our author, for the &s;ub&s;tance of what he &s;ays, being levelled at the following propo&s;itions of the Congre&s;s; that the government of Canada is rendered arbitrary, that the people are deprived of trial by jury, and that the Roman Catholick re|ligion is e&s;tabli&s;hed; if I &s;hall be able to &s;hew that the&s;e propo|&s;itions are true, then what he hath &s;aid to the contrary, will be of no avail. And fir&s;t, what can be more arbitrary than this? A Governor and Council appointed by, and dependent on the Crown, are the legi&s;lature of a whole region. They may &s;it at home, and frame edicts for the extreme&s;t parts of that va&s;t pro|vince, without any one check from the people. They may tax the colony as they plea&s;e, or hand it over to be fleeced by the Briti&s;h Commons. They may invent new crimes, and affix to them &s;uch new penalties, and make them cognizable before &s;uch new Courts, as they &s;hall think meet at their &s;overeign will and plea&s;ure, they may &s;eize and impri&s;on any member of the com|munity; or el&s;e more certainly and entirely, to ruin and oppre&s;s him, they may cau&s;e &s;ome minion of power to in&s;titute an action for his whole &s;ub&s;tance, and try him and condemn him, by the arbitrary principles, and more arbitrary judges of the civil law. For, in the &s;econd place, it is clear to a demon&s;tration, that trials by jury cannot be had there now; and it is equally clear that they never can exi&s;t hereafter, unle&s;s the Governor and Council chu&s;e to ri&s;k and dimini&s;h their power, by introducing this free and generous branch of Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence. How probable it is that they will thus put a curb on their own wantonne&s;s, I leave any man in his &s;en&s;es to determine. But thirdly, it is not civil tyranny alone, which is planted in Quebec, to over&s;hadow that immen&s;e country. From the &s;ame poi&s;onous root, ari&s;es the mo&s;t horrible religious tyranny, that my mind is capable of con|ceiving.&mdash;What e&s;tabli&s;hment can any religion have in any country on earth, unle&s;s it be a legal provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of its clergy? Look thro' Europe. See if Popery is in any other manner e&s;tabli&s;hed in any one country, than by payment of
<PB N="24" REF="013381_0023_0F905754D636E7A8">
tythes, and protection of Prie&s;ts. Is not this an e&s;tabli&s;hment? Is it not more? Is it not an encouragement? He who would go farther, mu&s;t re&s;ort to fire and &s;word; the arguments of tho&s;e barbarous ages and nations, who&s;e annals di&s;gu&s;t humanity. But the objection is, that when any man is converted, his Ma|je&s;ty may if he plea&s;es, encourage the Prote&s;tant Clergy as he plea&s;es, out of the tythes paid before to the Roman Prie&s;t. Allowing this argument to have weight, which indeed it has not; pray what likelihood is there that any man will be con|verted? Prote&s;tanti&s;m is the tender child of freedom and &s;cience: How then can it exi&s;t in the bold bo&s;om of ignorant de&s;poti&s;m? Without the patronage of one earthly friend. Without a &s;ingle rag to cover its nakedne&s;s. In ancient days the Romi&s;h Church was a firm barrier again&s;t the incroachments of Royal prerogative. The Clergy dependent on the Pope as their univer&s;al head, de|fied the menaces of kingly power. Thus were popular privi|leges in tho&s;e times frequently protected by popular &s;uper&s;tition. Our Mini&s;ters by a refinement of modern policy, have adopted the Church of Rome as a twin-&s;i&s;ter to the Church of England. Our &s;ubtle Mini&s;ters have placed the King of England in the &s;ame &s;ituation with the Roman pontiff Every dignitary of the Church is dependent on him, be&s;ides which he hath full power to appoint &s;uch Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, with &s;uch juri&s;dictions as he &s;hall think meet. Thus, all the bigotry, all the &s;uper&s;tition of a religion abounding in both, beyond any which the world hath be|held; all, all is in his Royal hand to be u&s;ed at his Royal will and plea&s;ure. To this full &s;upremacy over their &s;ouls, are joined the fulle&s;t temporal powers, both legi&s;lative and judicial; &s;o that like the ancient Patriarchs, he is King, Prie&s;t and Prophet. To fini&s;h the dreadful &s;y&s;tem, add all the executive powers of the State, and encircle the whole with a &s;tanding army, 'tis then compleat. The&s;e are facts? And whenever a wicked monarch in vengeance &s;hall ari&s;e; then &s;hall we behold him, the civil and religious tyrant, of a province which extends over half the Continent of America. Such is the tendency of the Canada Bill. View it, con&s;ider it, ponder upon it, in the coole&s;t, mo&s;t temporate di&s;po&s;ition; behold its con&s;equences, and the mild eye of rea&s;on will be clouded with a tear.</P>
<P>The next part of the Addre&s;s is to &s;hew, that the other Colo|nies need not trouble their heads about Bo&s;ton or Quebec. As to what he &s;ays about Quebec. I believe with him, that there is no intention of introducing Popery into the other colonies. Our Mini&s;ters, or rather Ma&s;ters, have more under&s;tanding than
<PB N="25" REF="013381_0024_0F905759710076D0">
to entertain &s;o wild an opinion. Nor would I per&s;wade man|kind to become Knights Errant, and wantonly undertake the quarrels, and fight the battles of other people. But I will leave it to any man, nay, I would almo&s;t appeal to the author of the addre&s;s him&s;elf, to determine; whether a country has not great rea&s;on to fear the lo&s;s of its liberties, when &s;urrounded by a mul|titude of &s;laves; e&s;pecially when tho&s;e &s;laves are inbued with principles inimical to it, and united together in one common intere&s;t, profe&s;&s;ion and faith, under one common head, and &s;up|ported by all the weight of a large empire. Does not experi|ence give additional force to every &s;olicitous apprehen&s;ion?</P>
<P>His ideas about Bo&s;ton amount to this: that we &s;hould act like wi&s;e foxes, for fear of being docked: or, in plain Engli&s;h, view with unconcern the de&s;truction of that capital, without daring to interpo&s;e for its pre&s;ervation. I beg pardon for re|peating a vulgar &s;tory: A Scotchman upon his arrival at an inn filled with travellers, crept into bed between an Engli&s;hman and an Iri&s;hman: towards the morning the Engli&s;hman was awaked by an inundation from his new bed-fellow, <Q>zounds, &s;ays he, what are you about?</Q> Hoot, hoot, mon, cried the politic Scot, <Q>lye down quiet; I have done wor&s;e to him be|hind me.</Q></P>
<P>But the author of the addre&s;s tells us: the di&s;pute with Great-Britain is <HI>de lana caprina.</HI> I learnt a little Latin at &s;chool, &s;o with the help of my &s;cholar&s;hip, and from what follows, I con|jecture that this means goats wool:&mdash;That this to &s;ay, all the grievances America has laboured under for a dozen years pa&s;t, amount to a meer trifle; which is &s;o &s;hockingly ab&s;urd, that it would be ridiculous to honour it with the ceremony of a con|futation.</P>
<P>As to the thought of e&s;tabli&s;hing a republic in America, breaking off our connexion with Great-Britain, and becoming independent: I con&s;ider it as the mo&s;t vain, empty, &s;hallow, and ridiculous project, that could po&s;&s;ibly enter into the heart of man. I do not believe there are five hundred on the conti|nent, who have the lea&s;t preten&s;ions to common &s;en&s;e, and who would not ri&s;que their deare&s;t blood, to prevent &s;uch mea&s;ures: This &s;uppo&s;ition, therefore, and what relates to it, I con&s;ider meerly as an introduction to his cen&s;ures on the Congre&s;s. The&s;e cen&s;ures &s;eem to be the main bu&s;ine&s;s and intention of the pam|phlet. If therefore in the avowed purpo&s;e of it (a con&s;ideration
<PB N="26" REF="013381_0025_0F90575ABB5C9820">
of the oppo&s;ition in America on principles of prudence and po|licy) I &s;hall be able to &s;hew; that the author is much mi&s;taken in condemning tho&s;e mea&s;ures which the Congre&s;s hath adopted; then all his declamation upon that &s;ubject, will be as the idle wind, which pa&s;&s;eth away and is heard no more.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t reflections he ca&s;ts on this re&s;pectable body, are far adopting the Suffolk re&s;olves. The a&s;perity and bitterne&s;s which appears in this part of the pamphlet, are to be attributed to the great warmth of the reverend compo&s;er. Reproaches from an angry man are ea&s;ily forgiven; and that meekne&s;s of di&s;po|&s;ition which attends the mini&s;ters of peace, will I hope mode|rate the unchri&s;tian tran&s;ports of our authors zeal, as &s;oon as his mi&s;takes are di&s;covered. By a member of the Congre&s;s, who&s;e honor and veracity &s;tand unimpeached, I am authorized to de|clare, that the Congre&s;s did not adopt the Suffolk re&s;olves. That the&s;e re&s;olves were never &s;o much as read for debate; and that upon the common reading, the &s;en&s;e of that body was, that it was proper to recommend moderate and pacific conduct, &s;up|ported by firmne&s;s and re&s;olution. The language of the Con|gre&s;s, in con&s;equence of this determination&punc; is as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly,</HI></P>
<P>That we thoroughly approve the wi&s;dom and fortitude, with which oppo&s;ition has been hitherto conducted; and earne&s;tly re|commend a per&s;everance in the &s;ame firm and temperate conduct, as expre&s;&s;ed in the re&s;olution &amp;c. Now then I appeal to the world, whether this is the cordial approbation of an independent government. Whether it is a tran&s;port of joy on the news of revolt. Whether it is a league with the wor&s;t enemies of A|merica, &s;urely it is not. The fair reputation of tho&s;e Gentle|men who compo&s;ed the Congre&s;s, render &s;uch imputations almo&s;t unpardonable. It is a duty therefore incumbent on the author of the Addre&s;s, to make &s;ome public acknowledgement; many did indeed expect that &s;ome con&s;titution would have been pointed out, to &s;ecure and e&s;tabli&s;h the freedom of America, and the &s;overeignty of that &s;upreme legi&s;lature, which ought certainly to govern the whole empire. This is a con&s;ummation devoutly to be wi&s;hed for, but it is not the work of a moment. Be&s;ides, it might have been thought pre&s;umptuous in them to undertake what is properly the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment, and the re&s;pective legi&s;latures of the Continent. Why

then are tho&s;e per&s;ons, who have generou&s;ly devoted their &s;er|vices to the Public, why are they to be cen&s;ured, for a &s;in of omi&s;&s;ion; which at any rate is pardonable on the &s;core of human infirmity?</P>
<P>Much paper is con&s;umed in the Addre&s;s, to paint tho&s;e horrors which await on civil war. To this I have no objection. For there is not a creature living, to whom &s;uch a pro&s;pect is more terrible than my&s;elf. And I dare &s;ay, a candid de&s;cription of my own feelings on the &s;ubject, would convey as genuine marks of dete&s;tation for that horrible cata&s;trophe, as the laboured pe|riods of the author before us. But I &s;ee no rea&s;ons for &s;uch appre|hen&s;ions. Neither do I think that man a friend to either coun|try, who &s;peaks of war between them except in the &s;tile of con|tempt. To imagine that America can cope with Great Britain, is the exce&s;s of &s;tupidity. And even if we were capable of the conte&s;t, were we certain of obtaining victory, I &s;hould pray that the hand in which I hold my pen, might wither e'er it drew the &s;word.&mdash;But let not the dread of power, draw off our attention from the pur&s;uit of freedom. Let us in every in&s;tance follow that example which our author recommends. In imitation of the inhabitants of Rye; whenever either duty to the mother country, or enthu&s;ia&s;m in the cau&s;e of humanity, &s;hall hurry us beyond the true line, of patrioti&s;m or obedience, let us take the earlie&s;t opportunity to retract our errors, and acknowledge our mi&s;takes.&mdash;Re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, is the undoubted privilege of mankind; but civil re&s;i&s;tance alone, is ju&s;tifiable in civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I come now to what our author hath &s;aid of the non-importa|tion agreement.&mdash;This he likens to the cutting off an arm, for a &s;ore on one of the fingers. Similies are very agreeable and proper, where they tend to throw light on the &s;ubject.&mdash;Now, if a man hath a &s;ore on his finger, he will naturally put a plai|&s;ter to it. If the finger grows wor&s;e, and he grows timid, he &s;ends for a &s;urgeon. If the topical applications of the &s;urgeon are inefficacious, and a gangrene en&s;ues, the parts are &s;carified, and the bone clean&s;ed. If this fails of &s;ucce&s;s, and corruption &s;preads along the limb, and threatens the vitals, the only hope which remains is from amputation. True it is, the patient may loo&s;e much blood by the inci&s;ion of his arteries, and death it|&s;elf may be the con&s;equence. But by undergoing it he has a chance for life, and otherwi&s;e his ca&s;e is de&s;perate. As an en|couragement

in &s;uch difficult emergencies, the &s;criptures tell us, if thy member offendeth thee, cut it off, and ca&s;t it away.</P>
<P>Now, reader, let me entreat your patience a little while longer. Pray ob&s;erve. The liberties of this country have been infringed in an article of trade. Common &s;en&s;e informs us, that if one impo&s;ition is admitted, another will follow. Petitions and re|mon&s;trances, have been pre&s;ented in vain. When we refu&s;ed the dutiable commodity, it was almo&s;t forced upon our accept|ance. No hope therefore remains from common efforts. And the que&s;tion is reduced to this &s;hort alternative: Which is mo&s;t advantageous, commerce or freedom? One or the other, we mu&s;t forego. The one for a time, or the other forever. I will wave the common ob&s;ervation, which is level to the lowe&s;t capa|city, that without freedom trade cannot flouri&s;h. But I mu&s;t beg leave to examine, from rea&s;on and experience, Whether a ce&s;&s;ation of trade will not procure us relief?</P>
<P>Nothing is more evident, than that the trade between Britain and the northern colonies, brings yearly very large &s;ums of money to the latter. That the balance of all the other trade &s;he enjoys, is on the whole again&s;t her. And that her annual expences amount to an enormous &s;um, great part whereof is paid into foreign countries, as intere&s;t for the national debt Is it not then equally evident, that a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of her commerce with us, mu&s;t greatly di&s;tre&s;s her? And to heighten this di&s;tre&s;s, what can be more effectual than to embarra&s;s her trade with the i&s;lands? Every good heart would wi&s;h to avoid this, and it is not our &s;malle&s;t misfortune, that to make men rea&s;on, we mu&s;t make them feel. Happy would it be if the authors of our mi|&s;ery, were the only &s;ufferers. To effect this de&s;irable purpo&s;e we had but one way, which was to injure the revenue, in &s;uch manner as to hold them up to the re&s;entment of the nation; and this has been done.&mdash;The wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ures may fail, but the&s;e at lea&s;t promi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;Great-Britain may indeed very ea&s;ily put an entire &s;tep to all our commerce. But this (if we may believe the Addre&s;s) is a mild puni&s;hment on Bo&s;ton. And if &s;o, why cannot we all undergo it? No, &s;ays he, inflicted on all of us, it would be very &s;evere. It would &s;o, but I tru&s;t not la&s;ting. Will a &s;toppage of our trade, pay the debts we owe in England? Will &s;hutting up our ports, breed &s;ailors for the navy of Britain? Millions in Europe are fed by the American plough; while bread can be purcha&s;ed on this continent will they &s;tarve? Will the Monarchs of France and Spain &s;ee their

&s;ubjects peri&s;h, that Americans may be reduced to &s;lavery? All the&s;e things may happen, and after all, this country is capable of &s;upporting its inhabitants.</P>
<P>Great are the difficulties we labour under, and many are the ob&s;tacles we mu&s;t &s;urmount. For the road to freedom and virtue, is not &s;trewed with flowers, but &s;prinkled with thorns. Perhaps our fortitude is not equal to the ta&s;k, if &s;o, we de&s;erve the con&s;equences. But remember, that the mother-country mu&s;t &s;uffer with her colonies: Remember, that a Non-Impor|tation has once procured a redre&s;s of our grievances. Remember that Concord is the parent of &s;ucce&s;s. Remember, that the wor&s;t which can po&s;&s;ibly befal us, even at the la&s;t, is that very &s;lavery which we mu&s;t now re&s;i&s;t or &s;ubmit to. O AMERICANS! the&s;e con&s;iderations are &s;ubmitted to you. Attend, and way the God of wi&s;dom, who foreknoweth all human events, &s;o di|rect you, as is mo&s;t comformable to the my&s;terious intentions of his Divine Providence. For the good of his creatures, mu&s;t be the will of him who is infinite goodne&s;s.</P>
