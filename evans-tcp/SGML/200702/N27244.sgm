<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS &s;trongly urged to publi&s;h the following work, immediately after my return from captiv|ity, which was nearly forty years ago&mdash;but, as at that time the Americans were &s;o little acquain|ted with Indian affairs, I apprehended a great part of it would be viewed as fable or romance.</P>
<P>As the Indians never attempted to prevent me either from reading or writing, I kept a Journal, which I revi&s;ed &s;hortly after my return from captivity, and which I have kept ever &s;ince: and as I have had but a moderate Engli&s;h education, have been advi&s;ed to employ &s;ome per&s;on of lib|eral education to tran&s;cribe and embelli&s;h it&mdash;but believing that nature always out&s;hines art, have thought, that occurrences truly and plainly &s;ta|ted, as they happened, would make the be&s;t hi&s;|tory, be better under&s;tood, and mo&s;t entertain|ing.</P>
<P>In the different Indian &s;peeches copied into this work, I have not only imitated their own &s;tyle, or mode of &s;peaking, but have al&s;o pre&s;erved the ideas meant to be communicated in tho&s;e &s;peeches &mdash;In common conver&s;ation, I have u&s;ed my own &s;tyle, but pre&s;erved their ideas. The principal advantage that I expect will re&s;ult to the public, from the publication of the following &s;heets, is the <HI>observations on the Indian mode of warfare.</HI> Ex|perience has taught the Americans the nece&s;&s;ity of adopting their mode, and the more perfect we are in that mode, the better we &s;hall be able to defend our&s;elves again&s;t them, when defence is nece&s;&s;ary,</P>

<HEAD>REMARKABLE OCCURRENCES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN May 1755, the province of Penn&s;ylvania, agreed to &s;end out three hundred men, in order to cut a waggon road from Fort Loudon, to join Braddock's road, near the Turkey Foot, or three forks of Yohogania; My brother-in-law, William Smith e&s;q. of Conococheague, was appointed commi&s;&s;ioner, to have the over&s;ight of the&s;e road-cutters.</P>
<P>Though I was at that time only eighteen years of age, I had fallen violently in love with a young lady, whom I apprehend|ed was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a large &s;hare of both beauty and virtue;&mdash; but being born between Venus and Mars, I concluded I mu&s;t al&s;o leave my dear fair one, and go out with this company of road-cutters, to &s;ee the event of this campaign; but &s;till ex|pecting that &s;ome time in the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer, I &s;hould again return to the arms of my beloved.</P>
<P>We went on with the road, without interruption, until near the Allegheny Mountain; when I was &s;ent back, in order to hur|ry up &s;ome provi&s;ion waggons that were on the way after us; I proceeded down the road as far as the cro&s;&s;ings of Juniata, where, finding the waggons were coming on as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, I returned up the road, again towards the Allegheny Mountain, in company with one Arnold Vigoras. About four or five miles above Bedford, three Indians had made a blind of bu&s;h|es, &s;tuck in the ground, as though they grew naturally, where they concealed them&s;elves, about fifteen yards from the road. When we came oppo&s;ite to them, they fired upon us, at this &s;hort di&s;tance, and killed my fellow traveller, yet their bullets did not touch me; but my hor&s;e making a violent &s;tart, threw me, and the Indians immediately ran up, and took me pri&s;oner. The one that laid hold on me was a Cana&s;atauga, the other two were Delawares. One of them could &s;peak En|gli&s;h, and a&s;ked me if there were any more white men coming
<PB N="6" REF="036317_0005_1008DBA3E32DB4F0">
after? I told them not any near, that I knew of. Two of the&s;e Indians &s;tood by me, whil&s;t the other &s;calped my comrade: they then &s;et off and ran at a &s;mart rate, through the woods, for a|bout fifteen miles, and that night we &s;lept on the Alegheny Mountain, without fire.</P>
<P>The next morning they divided the la&s;t of their provi&s;ion which they had brought from Fort DuQue&s;ne, and gave me an equal &s;hare, which was about two or three ounces of mouldy bi&s;cuit&mdash;this and a young Ground-Hog, about as large as a Rabbit, roa&s;ted, and al&s;o equally divided, was all the pro|vi&s;ion we had until we came to the Loyal-Hannan, which was about fifty miles; and a great part of the way we came through exceeding rocky Laurel-thickets, without any path. When we came to the We&s;t &s;ide of Laurel-Hill, they gave the &s;calp hal|loo, as u&s;ual, which is a long yell or halloo, for every &s;calp or pri&s;oner they have in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; the la&s;t of the&s;e &s;calp hal|loos were followed with quick and &s;udden, &s;hrill &s;houts of joy and triumph. On their performing this, we were an&s;wered by the firing of a number of guns on the Loyal-Hannan, one after an|other, quicker than one could count, by another party of Indi|ans, who were encamped near where Ligoneer now &s;tands. As we advanced near this party, they increa&s;ed with repeated &s;houts of joy and triumph; but I did not &s;hare with them in their exce&s;&s;ive mirth. When we came to this camp, we found they had plenty of Turkeys and other meat, there; and though I never before eat veni&s;on without bread or &s;alt; yet as I was hungry, it reli&s;hed very well. There we lay that night, and the next morning the whole of us marched on our way for Fort DuQue&s;ne. The night after we joined another camp of Indi|ans, with nearly the &s;ame ceremony, attended with great noi&s;e, and apparent joy, among all, except one. The next morning we continued our march, and in the afternoon we came in full view of the fort, which &s;tood on the point, near where Fort Pitt now &s;tands. We then made a halt on the bank of the A|legheny, and repeated the &s;calp halloo, which was an&s;wered by the firing of all the firelocks in the hands of both Indians and French who were in and about the fort, in the afore&s;aid man|ner, and al&s;o the great guns, which were followed by the con|tinued &s;houts and yells of the different &s;avage tribes who were then collected there.</P>
<P>As I was at this time unacquainted with this mode of firing and yelling of the &s;avages, I concluded that there were thou|&s;ands of Indians there, ready to receive General Braddock; but what added to my &s;urprize, I &s;aw numbers running tow|ards me, &s;tripped naked, excepting breech-clouts, and painted in the mo&s;t hideous manner, of various colors, though the prin|cipal
<PB N="7" REF="036317_0006_1008DBA56A9F0E78">
color was vermillion, or a bright red; yet there was annex|ed to this, black, brown, blue, &amp;c. As they approached, they formed them&s;elves into two long ranks, about two or three rods apart. I was told by an Indian that could &s;peak Engli&s;h, that I mu&s;t run betwixt the&s;e ranks, and that they would flog me all the way, as I ran, and if I ran quick, it would be &s;o much the better, as they would quit when I got to the end of the ranks. There appeared to be a general rejoicing around me, yet, I could find nothing like joy in my brea&s;t; but I &s;tarted to the race with all the re&s;olution and vigor I was capable of exert|ing, and found that it was as I had been told, for I was flogged the whole way. When I had got near the end of the lines, I was &s;truck with &s;omething that appeared to me to be a &s;tick, or the handle of a tommahawk, which cau&s;ed me to fall to the ground. On my recovering my &s;en&s;es, I endeavored to renew my race; but as I aro&s;e, &s;ome one ca&s;t &s;and in my eyes, which blinded me &s;o, that I could not &s;ee where to run. They conti|nued beating me mo&s;t intolerably, until I was at length in&s;en&s;i|ble; but before I lo&s;t my &s;en&s;es, I remember my wi&s;hing them to &s;trike the fatal blow, for I thought they intended killing me, but apprehended they were too long about it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I remember was my being in the fort, amid&s;t the French and Indians, and a French doctor &s;tanding by me, who had opened a vein in my left arm: after which the inter|preter a&s;ked me how I did, I told him I felt much pain; the doctor then wa&s;hed my wounds, and the brui&s;ed places of my body, with French brandy. As I felt faint, and the brandy &s;melt well, I a&s;ked for &s;ome inwardly, but the doctor told me, by the in|terpreter, that it did not &s;uit my ca&s;e.</P>
<P>When they found I could &s;peak, a number of Indians came around me, and examined me with threats of cruel death, if I did not tell the truth. The fir&s;t que&s;tion they a&s;ked me, was, how many men were there in the party that were coming from Penn&s;ylvania, to join Braddock? I told them the truth, that there were three hundred. The next que&s;tion was, were they well armed? I told them them they were all well armed, (mean|ing the arm of fle&s;h) for they had only about thirty guns among the whole of them; which, if the Indians had known, they would certainly have gone and cut them all off&punc; therefore I could not in con&s;cience let them know the defencele&s;s &s;ituation of the&s;e road-cutters. I was then &s;ent to the ho&s;pital, and carefully attended by the doctors, and recovered quicker than what I expected.</P>
<P>Some time after I was there, I was vi&s;ited by the Delaware Indian already mentioned, who was at the taking of me, and could &s;peak &s;ome Engli&s;h. Though he &s;poke but bad Engli&s;h,
<PB N="8" REF="036317_0007_1008DBA85C4048D8">
yet I found him to be a man of con&s;iderable under&s;tanding. I a&s;ked him if I had done any thing that had offended the Indi|ans, which cau&s;ed them to treat me &s;o unmercifully? He &s;aid no, it was only an old cu&s;tom the Indians had, and it was like how do you do; after that he &s;aid I would be well u&s;ed. I a&s;ked him if I &s;hould be admitted to remain with the French? He &s;aid no &mdash;and told me that as &s;oon as I recovered, I mu&s;t not only go with the Indians, but mu&s;t be made an Indian my&s;elf. I a&s;ked him what news from Braddock's army? He &s;aid the Indians &s;pied them every day, and he &s;hewed me by making marks on the ground with a &s;tick, that Braddock's army was advancing in very clo&s;e order, and that the Indians would &s;urround them, take trees, and (as he expre&s;&s;ed it) <HI>shoot um down all one pi|geon.</HI></P>
<P>Shortly after this, on the 9th day of July 1755, in the morn|ing I heard a great &s;tir in the fort. As I could then walk with a &s;taff in my hand, I went out of the door which was ju&s;t by the wall of the fort, and &s;tood upon the wall and viewed the Indi|ans in a huddle before the gate, where were barrels of powder, bullets, flints &amp;c. and every one taking what &s;uited; I &s;aw the Indians al&s;o march off in rank, intire&mdash;likewi&s;e the French Ca|nadians, and &s;ome regulars, after viewing the Indians and French in different po&s;itions, I computed them to be about four hundred, and wondered that they attempted to go out again&s;t Braddock with &s;o &s;mall a party. I was then in high hopes that I would &s;oon &s;ee them flying before the Briti&s;h troops, and that general Braddock would take the fort and re&s;cue me.</P>
<P>I remained anxious to know the event of this day; and in the afternoon I again ob&s;erved a great noi&s;e and commotion in the fort, and though at that time I could not under&s;tand French, yet I found that it was the voice of Joy and triumph, and fear|ed that they had received what I called bad news.</P>
<P>I had ob&s;erved &s;ome of the old country &s;oldiers &s;peak Dutch, as I &s;poke Dutch I went to one of them, and a&s;ked him what was the news? he told me that a runner had ju&s;t arrived, who &s;aid that Braddock would certainly be defeated; that the Indians and French had &s;urrounded him, and were concealed behind trees and in gullies, and kept a con&s;tant fire upon the Engli&s;h, and that they &s;aw the Engli&s;h falling in heaps, and if they did not take the river which was the only gap, and make their e&s;cape, there would not be one man left alive before &s;un down. Some time after this I heard a number of &s;calp halloo's and &s;aw a company of Indians and French coming in. I ob&s;erved they had a great many bloody &s;calps, grenadiers' caps, Briti&s;h canteens, bayo|nets &amp;c. with them. They brought the news that Braddock was defeated. After that another company came in which ap|peared
<PB N="9" REF="036317_0008_1008DBAA104C7088">
to be about one hundred, and chiefly Indians, and it &s;eemed to me that almo&s;t every one of this company was car|rying &s;calps; after this came another company with a number of waggon-hor&s;es, and al&s;o a great many &s;calps. Tho&s;e that were coming in, and tho&s;e that had arrived, kept a con&s;tant fi|ring of &s;mall arms, and al&s;o the great guns in the fort, which were accompanied with the mo&s;t hedious &s;houts and yells from all quarters; &s;o that it appeared to me as if the infernal regi|ons had broke loo&s;e.</P>
<P>About &s;un down I beheld a &s;mall party coming in with about a dozen pri&s;oners, &s;tripped naked, with their hands tied behind their backs, and their faces, and part of their bodies blacked&mdash; the&s;e pri&s;oners they burned to death on the bank of Alegheny River oppo&s;ite to the fort. I &s;tood on the fort wall until I be|held them begin to burn one of the&s;e men, they had him tied to a &s;take and kept touching him with fire-brands, red-hod irons &amp;c. and he &s;creeming in a mo&s;t doleful manner,&mdash;the Indians
in the mean time yelling like infernal &s;pirits. As this &s;cene appeared too &s;hocking for me to behold, I retired to my lodg|ing both &s;ore and &s;orry.</P>
<P>When I came into my longings I &s;aw Ru&s;&s;el's Seven Ser|mons, which they had brought from the field of battle, which a Frenchman made a pre&s;ent of to me. From the be&s;t infor|mation I could receive there were only &s;even Indians and four French killed in this battle, and five hundred Briti&s;h lay dead in the field; be&s;ides what were killed in the river on their re|treat.</P>
<P>The morning after the battle I &s;aw Braddock's artilery brought into the fort, the &s;ame day I al&s;o &s;aw &s;everal Indians in Briti&s;h-officers' dre&s;s with &s;a&s;h, half-moon, laced hats &amp;c. which the Briti&s;h then wore.</P>
<P>A few days after this the Indians demanded me and I was obliged to go with them. I was not yet well able to march, but they took me in a canoe, up the Alegheny River to an In|dian town that was on the north &s;ide of the river, about forty miles above Fort DuQue&s;ne. Here I remained about three weeks, and was then taken to an Indian town on the we&s;t branch of Mu&s;kingum, about twenty miles above the forks, which was called Tullihas, inhabited by Delawares, Caughne|wagos and Mohicans.&mdash;On our rout betwixt the afore&s;aid towns, the country was chiefly black-oak and white-oak land, which appeared generally to be good wheat land, chiefly &s;e|cond and third rate, intermixed with &s;ome rich bottoms.</P>
<P>The day after my arrival at the afore&s;aid town, a number of Indians collected about me, and one of them began to pull the hair out of my head. He had &s;ome a&s;hes on a piece of
<PB N="10" REF="036317_0009_1008DBAB9887B190">
bark, in which he frequently dipped his fingers in order to take the firmer hold, and &s;o he went on, as if he had been plucking a turkey, until he had all the hair clean out of my head, ex|cept a &s;mall &s;pot about three or four inches &s;quare on my crown; this they cut off with a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ors, excepting three locks, which they dre&s;&s;ed up in their own mode. Two of the&s;e they wraped round with a narrow beaded garter made by them&s;elves for that purpo&s;e, and the other they platted at full length, and then &s;tuck it full of &s;ilver broches. After this they bored my no&s;e and ears, and fixed me off with ear rings and no&s;e jewels, then they ordered me to &s;trip off my clothes and put on a breech-clout, which I did; they then painted my head, face and body in various colours. They put a large belt of wampom on my neck, and &s;ilver bands on my hands and right arm; and &s;o an old chief led me out in the &s;treet and gave the alarm halloo, <HI>coo-wigh,</HI> &s;everal times repeated quick, and on this all that were in the town came running and &s;tood round the old chief, who held me by the hand in the mid&s;t.&mdash; As I at that time knew nothing of their mode of adoption, and had &s;een them put to death all they had taken, and as I never could find that they &s;aved a man alive at Braddock's defeat, I made no doubt but they were about putting me to death in &s;ome cruel manner. The old chief holding me by the hand made a long &s;peech very loud, and when he had done he handed me to three young &s;quaws, who led me by the hand down the bank in|to the river until the water was up to our middle. The &s;quaws then made &s;igns to me to plunge my&s;elf into the water, but I did not under&s;tand them; I thought that the re&s;ult of the council was that I &s;hould be drowned, and that the&s;e young ladies were to be the executioners. They all three laid vio|lent hold of me, and I for &s;ome time oppo&s;ed them with all my might, which occa&s;ioned loud laughter by the multitude that were on the bank of the river. At length one of the &s;quaws made out to &s;peak a little Engli&s;h (for I believe they began to be afraid of me) and &s;aid, <HI>no hurt you</HI>; on this I gave my&s;elf up to their lady&s;hips, who were as good as their word; for though they plunged me under water, and wa&s;hed and rubbed me &s;everely, yet I could not &s;ay they hurt me much.</P>
<P>The&s;e young women then led me up to the council hou&s;e, where &s;ome of the tribe were ready with new cloths for me. They gave me a new ruffled &s;hirt, which I put on, al&s;o a pair of leggins done off with ribbons and beads, likewi&s;e a pair of mocka&s;ons, and garters dre&s;&s;ed with beads, Porcupine-quills, and redhair&mdash;al&s;o a tin&s;el laced cappo. They again painted my head and face with various colors, and tied a bunch of red feathers to one of the&s;e locks they had left on the crown of
<PB N="11" REF="036317_0010_1008DBB21E890440">
my head, which &s;tood up five or &s;ix inches. They &s;eated me on a bear &s;kin, and gave me a pipe, tomakawk, and polecat &s;kin pouch, which had been &s;kined pocket fa&s;hion, and contained to|bacco, killegenico, or dry &s;umach leaves, which they mix with their tobacco,&mdash;al&s;o &s;punk, flint and &s;teel. When I was thus &s;eated, the Indians came in dre&s;&s;ed and painted in their grande&s;t manner. As they came in they took their &s;eats and for a con&s;iderable time there was a profound &s;ilence, every one was &s;moking,&mdash;but not a word was &s;poken among them.&mdash;At length one of the chiefs made a &s;peech which was delivered to me by an interpretor,&mdash;and was as followeth:&mdash;"My &s;on, you are now fle&s;h of our fle&s;h, and bone of our bone. By the ceremony which was performed this day, every drop of white blood was wa&s;hed out of your veins; you are taken into the Caughnewago nation, and initiated into a warlike tribe; you are adopted into a great family, and now received with great &s;eriousne&s;s and &s;olemnity in the room and place of a great man; after what has pa&s;&s;ed this day, you are now one of us by an old &s;trong law and cu&s;tom&mdash;My &s;on, you have now nothing to fear, we are now under the &s;ame obligations to love, &s;up|port and defend you, that we are to love and defend one an|other, therefore you are to con&s;ider your&s;elf as one of our people."&mdash;At this time I did not believe this fine &s;peech, e&s;|pecially that of the white blood being wa&s;hed out of me; but &s;ince that time I have found that there was much &s;incerity in &s;aid &s;peech,&mdash;for from that day I never knew them to make a|ny di&s;tinction between me and them&s;elves in any re&s;pect what|ever until I left them.&mdash;If they had plenty of cloathing I had plenty, if we were &s;carce we all &s;hared one fate.</P>
<P>After this ceremony was over, I was introduced to my new kin, and told that I was to attend a fea&s;t that evening, which I did. And as the cu&s;tom was, they gave me al&s;o a bowl and wood|en &s;poon, which I carried with me to the place, where there was a number of large bra&s;s kettles full of boiled veni&s;on and green corn; every one advanced with his bowl and &s;poon and had his &s;hare given him.&mdash;After this one of the chiefs made a &s;hort &s;peech, and then we began to eat.</P>
<P>The name of one of the chiefs in this town was Tecanyater|ighto, alias Pluggy, and the other A&s;allecoa, alias Mohawk Solo|man.&mdash;As Pluggy and his party were to &s;tart the next day to war, to the frontiers of Virginia, the next thing to be perfor|med was the war dance, and their war &s;ongs. At their war dance they had both vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic. They had a &s;hort hollow gum clo&s;e in one end, with water in it, and parchment &s;tretched over the open end thereof, which they beat with one &s;tick, and made a &s;ound nearly like a muffled
<PB N="12" REF="036317_0011_1008DBB3DB9F1738">
drum.&mdash;all tho&s;e who were going on this expedition collected together and formed. An old Indian then began to &s;ing, and ti|med the mu&s;ic by beating on this drum, as the ancients formerly timed their mu&s;ic by beating the tabor. On this the warriors began to advance, or move, forward in concert, like well di&s;ci|plined troops would march to the fife and drum. Each warrior had a tomahawk, &s;pear or war-mallet in his hand, and they all moved regularly towards the ea&s;t, or the way they intended to go to war. At length they all &s;tretched their tomahawks tow|ards the Potomack, and giving a hideous &s;hout or yell, they wheeled quick about, and danced in the &s;ame manner back. The next was the war &s;ong. In performing this, only one &s;ung at a time, in a moving po&s;ture, with a tomahawk in his hand, while all the other wariors were engaged in calling aloud <HI>he-uh, he-uh,</HI> which they con&s;tantly repeated, while the war &s;ong was going on. When the warior that was &s;inging had ended his &s;ong, he &s;truck a war po&s;t with his tomahawk, and with a loud voice told what warlike exploits he had done, and what he now inten|ded to do: which were an&s;wered by the other wariors, with loud &s;houts of applau&s;e. Some who had not before intended to go to war, at this time were &s;o animated by this performance, that they took up the tomahawk and &s;ung the war &s;ong, which was an&s;wered with &s;houts of joy, as they were then initiated into the pre&s;ent marching company. The next morning this company all collected at one place, with their heads and faces painted with various colors, and packs upon their backs: they marched off, all &s;ilent, except the commander, who, in the front &s;ung the travelling &s;ong, which began in this manner: <HI>hoo caughtainte beegana.</HI> Ju&s;t as the rear pa&s;&s;ed the end of the town, they began to fire in their &s;low manner, from the front to the rear, which was accompanied with &s;houts and yells from all quarters.</P>
<P>This evening I was invited to another &s;ort of dance, which was a kind of promi&s;cuos dance. The young men &s;tood in one rank, and the young women in another, about one rod apart, facing each other. The one that rai&s;ed the tune, or &s;tarted the &s;ong, held a &s;mall gourd or dry &s;hell of a &s;qua&s;h, in his hand, which contained beads or &s;mall &s;tones, which rattled. When he began to &s;ing, he timed the tune with his rattle; both men and women danced and &s;ung together, advancing towards each other, &s;tooping until their heads would be touching together, and then cea&s;ed from dancing, with loud &s;houts, and retreated and formed again, and &s;o repeated the &s;ame thing over and over, for three or four hours, without intermi&s;&s;ion. This exerci&s;e ap|peared to one at fir&s;t, irrational and in&s;ipid; but I found that in &s;inging their tunes, they u&s;ed <HI>ya ne no hoo wa ne, &amp;c.</HI> like our <HI>fa
<PB N="13" REF="036317_0012_1008DBB5CFDEAEE0">
sol la,</HI> and though they have no &s;uch thing as jingling ver&s;e, yet they can intermix &s;entences with their notes, and &s;ay what they plea&s;e to each other, and carry on the tune in concert. I found that this was a kind of wooing or courting dance, and as they advanced &s;tooping with their heads together, they could &s;ay what they plea&s;ed in each others ear, without di&s;concerting their rough mu&s;ic, and the others, or tho&s;e near, not hear what they &s;ay.</P>
<P>Shortly after this I went out to hunt, in company with Mo|hawk Solomon, &s;ome of the Caughnewagas and a Delaware In|dian that was married to a Caughnewaga &s;quaw. We travel|led about &s;outh, from this town, and the fir&s;t night we killed nothing, but we had with us green corn, which we roa&s;ted and ate that night. The next day we encamped about twelve o'clock, and the hunters turned out to hunt, and I went down the run that we encamped on, in company with &s;ome &s;quaws and boys, to hunt plumbs, which we found in great plenty. On my return to camp I ob&s;erved a large piece of fat meat: the Delaware Indian that could talk &s;ome Engli&s;h, ob&s;erved me looking earne&s;tly at this meat, and a&s;ked me <HI>what meat you think that is?</HI> I &s;aid I &s;uppo&s;ed it was bear meat; he laughed and &s;aid, <HI>ho, all one fool you, beal now elly pool,</HI> and pointing to the other &s;ide of the camp, he &s;aid <HI>look at that skin, you think that beal skin?</HI> I went and lifted the &s;kin, which appeared like an ox hide: he then &s;aid, <HI>what skin you think that?</HI> I replied that I thought it was a buffaloe hide; he laughed and &s;aid <HI>you fool again, you know nothing, you think buffaloe that colo?</HI> I ac|knowledged I did not know much about the&s;e things, and told him I never &s;aw a buffaloe, and that I had not heard what co|lor they were. He replyed <HI>by and by you shall see glent many buffaloe: He now go to gleat lick. That skin no buffaloe skin, that skin buck-elk skin.</HI> They went out with hor&s;es, and brought in the remainder of this buck-elk, which was the fat|te&s;t creature I ever &s;aw of the tallow kind.</P>
<P>We remained at this camp about eight or ten days, and kill|ed a number of deer. Though we had neither bread or &s;alt at this time, yet we had both roa&s;t and boiled meat in great plen|ty, and they were frequently inviting me to eat, when I had no appetite.</P>
<P>We then moved to the buffaloe lick, where we killed &s;everal buffaloe, and in their &s;mall bra&s;s kettles they made about half a bu&s;hel of &s;alt. I &s;uppo&s;e this lick was about thirty or forty miles from the afore&s;aid town, and &s;omewhere between the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, Ohio and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. About the lick was clear, open <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and thin white-oak land, and at that time there were
<PB N="14" REF="036317_0013_1008DBB7D3E65088">
large roads leading to the lick, like waggon roads. We moved from this lick about &s;ix or &s;even miles, and encamped on a creek.</P>
<P>Though the Indians had given me a gun, I had not yet been admitted to go out from the camp to hunt. At this place Mo|hawk Solomon a&s;ked me to go out with him to hunt, which I readily agreed to. After &s;ome time we came upon &s;ome fre&s;h buffaloe tracks. I had ob&s;erved before this that the Indians were upon their guard, and afraid of an enemy; for, until now they and the &s;outhern nations had been at war. As we were following the buffaloe tracks, Solomon &s;eemed to be upon his guard, went very &s;low, and would frequently &s;tand and li&s;ten, and appeared to be in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. We came to where the tracks were very plain in the &s;and, and I &s;aid it is &s;urely buffaloe tracks; he &s;aid <HI>hush, you know nothing, may be buffaloe tracks, may be Catawba.</HI> He went very cautious until we found &s;ome fre&s;h buffaloe dung: he then &s;miled and &s;aid <HI>Catawba can not make so.</HI> He then &s;topped and told me an odd &s;tory about the Catawbas. He &s;aid that formerly the Catawbas came near one of their hunting camps, and at &s;ome di&s;tance from the camp lay in ambu&s;h, and in order to decoy them out, &s;ent two or three Catawbas in the night, pa&s;t their camp, with buffaloe hoofs fixed on their feet, &s;o as to make artificial tracks. In the morning tho&s;e in the camp followed after the&s;e tracks, thinking they were Buffaloe, until they were fired on by the Catawbas, and &s;everal of them killed; the others fled, collected a party and pur&s;ed the Catawbas; but they, in their &s;ubtilty brought with them rattle-&s;nake poi&s;on, which they had collected from the bladder that lieth at the root of the &s;nakes' teeth; this they had corked up in a &s;hort piece of a cane-&s;talk; they had al&s;o brought with them &s;mall cane or reed, about the &s;ize of a rye &s;traw, which they made &s;harp at the end like a pen, and dipped them in this poi&s;on, and &s;tuck them in the ground among the gra&s;s, along their own tracks, in &s;uch a po&s;ition that they might &s;tick into the legs of the pur&s;uers, which an&s;wered the de&s;ign; and as the Catawbas had runners behind to watch the motion of the pur&s;uers, when they found that a number of them were lame, being artificially &s;nake bit, and that they were all turn|ing back, the Catawbas turned upon the pur&s;uers, and defeated them, and killed and &s;calped all tho&s;e that were lame.&mdash;When Solomon had fini&s;hed this &s;tory, and found that I under&s;tood him, concluded by &s;aying, <HI>you don't know, Catawba velly bad Indian, Catawba all one Devil Catawba.</HI></P>
<P>Some time after this, I was told to take the dogs with me and go down the creek, perhaps I might kill a turkey; it being in the afternoon, I was al&s;o told not to go far from the creek,
<PB N="15" REF="036317_0014_1008DBBECE9E2448">
and to come up the creek again to the camp, and to take care not to get lo&s;t. When I had gone &s;ome di&s;tance down the creek, I came upon fre&s;h buffaloe tracks, and as I had a num|ber of dogs with me to &s;top the buffaloe, I concluded I would follow after and kill one; and as the gra&s;s and weeds were rank&punc; I could readily follow the track. A little before &s;undown, I de&s;paired of coming up with them: I was then thinking how I might get to camp before night: I concluded as the buffaloe had made &s;everal turns, if I took the track back to the creek, it would be dark before I could get to camp; therefore I thought I would take a near way through the hills, and &s;trike the creek a little below the camp; but as it was cloudy weather, and I a very young wood&s;man, I could find neither creek or camp. When night came on I fired my gun &s;everal times, and hallooed, but could have no an&s;wer. The next morning early, the Indi|ans were out after me, and as I had with me ten or a dozen dogs, and the gra&s;s and weeds rank, they could readily follow my track. When they came up with me, they appeared to be in a very good humor. I a&s;ked Solomon if he thought I was running away, he &s;aid <HI>no no, you go too much clooked.</HI> On my return to camp they took my gun from me, and for this ra&s;h &s;tep I was reduced to a bow and arrows, for near two years. We were out on this tour about &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>This country is generally hilly, though intermixed with con|&s;iderable quantities of rich upland, and &s;ome good bottoms.</P>
<P>When we returned to the town, Pluggy and his party had arrived, and brought with them a con&s;iderable number of &s;calps and pri&s;oners from the South Branch of Potomack: they al&s;o brought with them an Engli&s;h Bible, which they gave to a Dutch woman who was a pri&s;oner; but as &s;he could not read Engli&s;h, &s;he made a pre&s;ent of it to me, which was very ac|ceptable.</P>
<P>I remained in this town until &s;ome time in October, when my adopted brother, called Tontileaugo, who had married a Wian|dot &s;quaw, took me with him to Lake Erie. We proceeded up the we&s;t branch of Mu&s;kingum, and for &s;ome di&s;tance up the river the land was hilly but intermixed with large bodies of tolerable rich upland, and excellent bottoms. We proceed|ed on, to the head waters of the we&s;t branch of Mu&s;kingum. On the head waters of this branch, and from thence to the wa|ters of Cane&s;adooharie, there is a large body of rich, well lying land&mdash;the timber is a&s;h, walnut, &s;ugar-tree, buckeye, honey-locu&s;t and cherry, intermixed with &s;ome oak, hickory, &amp;c.&mdash; This tour was at the time that the black-haws were ripe, and we were &s;eldom out of &s;ight of them: they were common here both in the bottoms and upland.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="036317_0015_1008DBC2A90E9EC0">On this route we had no hor&s;es with us, and when we &s;tarted from the town, all the pack I carried was a pouch, containing my books, a little dried veni&s;on, and my blanket. I had then no gun, but Tontileaugo who was a fir&s;t rate hunter, carried a rifle gun, and every day killed deer, racoons or bears. We left the meat, excepting a little for pre&s;ent u&s;e, and carried the &s;kins with us until we encamped, and then &s;tretched them with elm bark, in a frame made with poles &s;tuck in the ground and tied together with lynn or elm bark; and when the &s;kins were dried by the fire, we packed them up, and carried them with us the next day.</P>
<P>As Tontileaugo could not &s;peak Engli&s;h, I had to make u&s;e of all the Caughnewaga I had learned even to talk very imper|fectly with him; but I found I learned to talk Indian fa&s;ter this way, than when I had tho&s;e with me who could &s;peak Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>As we proceeded down the Cane&s;adooharie waters, our packs encrea&s;ed by the &s;kins that were daily killed, and became &s;o very heavy that we could not march more than eight or ten miles per day. We came to Lake Erie about &s;ix miles we&s;t of the mouth of Cane&s;adooharie. As the wind was very high the evening we came to the Lake, I was &s;urprized to hear the roaring of the water, and &s;ee the high waves that da&s;hed again&s;t the &s;hore, like the Ocean. We encamped on a run near the lake; and as the wind fell that night, the next morning the lake was only in a moderate motion, and we marched on the &s;and along the &s;ide of the water, frequently re&s;ting our&s;elves, as we were heavy laden. I &s;aw on the &s;trand, a number of large fi&s;h, that had been left in flat or hollow places; as the wind fell and the waves abated, they were left without water, or only a &s;mall quantity; and numbers of Bald and Grey Ea|gles, &amp;c. were along the &s;hore devouring them.</P>
<P>Some time in the afternoon we came to a large camp of Wi|andots, at the mouth of Cane&s;adooharie, where Tontileaugo's wife was. Here we were kindly received: they gave us a kind of rough, brown potatoes, which grew &s;pontaneou&s;ly and is called by the Caughnewagas <HI>obnenata.</HI> The&s;e potatoes peeled and dipped in racoons' fat, ta&s;te nearly like our &s;weet-potatoes. They al&s;o gave us what they call <HI>canebeanta,</HI> which is a kind of homony, made of green corn, dried, and beans mixed together.</P>
<P>From the head waters of Cane&s;adooharie to this place, the land is generally good; chiefly fir&s;t or &s;econd rate, and, com|paratively, little or no third rate. The only refu&s;e is &s;ome &s;wamps, that appear to be too wet for u&s;e, yet I apprehend that a number of them, if drained, would make excellent mea|dows. The timber is black-oak, walnut, hickory, cherry, black-a&s;h,
<PB N="17" REF="036317_0016_1008DBC472F5DA48">
white-a&s;h, water-a&s;h, buckeye, black-locu&s;t, honey-locu&s;t, &s;u|gar-tree and elm: there is al&s;o &s;ome land, though, comparatively, but &s;mall, where the timber is chiefly white-oak or beach&mdash;this may be called third rate. In the bottoms, and al&s;o many pla|ces in the upland, there is a large quantity of wild apple, plumb, and red and black-haw trees. It appeared to be well watered, and a plenty of meadow ground, intermixed with upland, but no large prairies or glades, that I &s;aw, or heard of. In this route, deer, bear, turkeys and racoons, appeared plenty, but no buffaloe, and very little &s;ign of elks.</P>
<P>We continued our camp at the mouth of Cane&s;adooharie for &s;ome time, where we killed &s;ome deer, and a great many racoons; the racoons here were remarkably large and fat.&mdash; At length we all embarked in a large birch bark canoe. This ve&s;&s;el was about four feet wide, and three feet deep, and about five and thirty feet long: and tho it could carry a heavy bur|den, it was &s;o artfully and curiou&s;ly con&s;tructed that four men could cary it &s;everal miles, or from one landing place to ano|ther, or from the waters of the Lake to the waters of the Ohio. &mdash;We proceeded up Cane&s;adooharie a few miles and went on &s;hore to hunt; but to my great &s;urpri&s;e they carried the ve&s;&s;el that we all came in up the bank, and inverted it or turned the bottom up, and converted it to a dwelling hou&s;e, and kindled a fire before us to warm our&s;eves by and cook. With our bag|gage and our&s;elves in this hou&s;e we were very much crouded, yet our little hou&s;e turned off the rain very well.</P>
<P>We kept moving and hunting up this river until we came to the falls; here we remained &s;ome weeks, and killed a number of deer, &s;everal bears, and a great many racoons. From the mouth of this river to the falls is about five and twenty miles. On our pa&s;&s;age up I was not much out from the river, but what I &s;aw was good land, and not hilly.</P>
<P>About the falls is thin che&s;nut land, which is almo&s;t the on|ly che&s;nut timber I ever &s;aw in this country.</P>
<P>While we remained here, I left my pouch with my books in camp, wrapt up in my blanket, and went out to hunt che&s;nuts. On my return to camp my books were mi&s;&s;ing. I enquired af|ter them, and a&s;ked the Indians if they knew where they were, they told me that they &s;uppo&s;ed the puppies had carried them off. I did not believe them; but thought they were di&s;|plea&s;ed at my poring over my books, and concluded that they had de&s;troyed them, or put them out of my way.</P>
<P>After this I was again out after nuts, and on my return be|held a new erection, which were two white oak &s;aplings, that were forked about twelve feet high, and &s;tood about fifteen feet apart. They had cut the&s;e &s;aplings at the forks and laid a
<PB N="18" REF="036317_0017_1008DBC5FB0F4340">
&s;trong pole acro&s;s which appeared in the form of a gallows, and the po&s;ts they had &s;haved very &s;mooth and painted in places with vermillion. I could not conceive the u&s;e of this piece of work, and at length concluded it was a gallows, I thought that I had di&s;plea&s;ed them by reading my books, and that they were a|bout puting me to death.&mdash;The next morning I ob&s;erved them bringing their &s;kins all to this place and hanging them over this pole, &s;o as to pre&s;erve them from being injured by the weather, this removed my fears. They al&s;o buried their large canoe in the ground, which is the way they took to pra&s;erve this &s;ort of a canoe in the winter &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>As we had at this time no hor&s;es, every one got a pack on his back, and we &s;teered an ea&s;t cour&s;e about twelve miles, and en|camped. The next morning we proceeded on the &s;ame cour&s;e about ten miles to a large creek that empties into Lake Erie be|twixt Cane&s;adooharie, and Cayahaga. Here they made their win|tercabbin, in the following form. They cut logs about fifteen feet long, and laid the&s;e longs upon each other, and drove po&s;ts in the ground at each end to keep them together; the po&s;ts they tied together at the top with bark, and by this means rai|&s;ed a wall fifteen feet long, and about four feet high, and in the &s;ame manner they rai&s;ed another wall oppo&s;ite to this, at a|bout twelve feet di&s;tance; then they drove forks in the ground in the centre of each end, and laid a &s;trong pole from end to end on the&s;e forks; and from the&s;e walls to the poles, they &s;et up poles in&s;tead of rafters, and on the&s;e they tied &s;mall poles in place of laths; and a cover was made of lynn bark which will run even in the winter &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>As every tree will not run, they examine the tree fir&s;t, by trying it near the ground, and when they find it will do, they fall the tree and rai&s;e the bark with the tomahawk, near the top of the tree about five or &s;ix inches broad, then put the tomahawk handle under this bark, and pull it along down to the butt of the tree; &s;o that &s;ome times one piece of bark will he thirty feet long; this bark they cut at &s;uitable lengths in order to cover the hut.</P>
<P>At the end of the&s;e walls they &s;et up &s;plit timber, &s;o that they had timber all round, excepting a door at each end. At the top, in place of a chimney, they left an open place, and for bedding they laid down the afore&s;aid kind of bark, on which they &s;pread bear &s;kins. From end to end of this hut along the middle there were fires, which the &s;quaws made of dry &s;plit wood and the holes or open places that appeared, the &s;quaws &s;topped with mo&s;s, which they collected from old logs; and at the door they hung a bear &s;kin; and notwith&s;tanding the winters an hard here, our lodging was much better than what I expected&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="036317_0018_1008DBCCB65587D8">It was &s;ome time in December when we fini&s;hed this winter cabin; but when we had got into this comparatively fine lodg|ing, another difficulty aro&s;e, we had nothing to eat. While I was travelling with Tontileaugo, as was before mentioned, and had plenty of fat veni&s;on, bears meat and racoons, I then thought it was hard living without bread or Salt; but now I began to conclude, that if I had any thing that would bani&s;h pinching hunger, and keep &s;oul and body together I would be content.</P>
<P>While the hunters were all out, exerting them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t of their ability, the &s;quaws and boys (in which cla&s;s I was) were &s;cattered out in the bottoms, hunting red-haws, black-haws and hickory-nuts. As it was too late in the year, we did not &s;ucceed in gathering haws; but we had tolerable &s;uc|ce&s;s in &s;cratching up hickory-nuts from under a light &s;now, which we carried with us le&s;t the hunters &s;hould not &s;ucceed. After our return the hunters came in, who had killed only two &s;mall turkeys, which were but little among eight hunters, and thirteen &s;quaws, boys, and children;&mdash;but they were divided with the greate&s;t equity and ju&s;tice&mdash;every one got their equal &s;hare.</P>
<P>The next day the hunters turned out again, and killed one deer and three bears.</P>
<P>One of the bears was very large and remarkably fat. The hunters carried in meat &s;ufficient to give us all a hearty &s;upper and breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;quaws and all that could carry turned out to bring in meat,&mdash;every one had their &s;hare a&s;&s;igned them, and my load was among the lea&s;t; yet, not being accu&s;tomed to carrying in this way, I got exceeding weary, and told them my load was too heavy, I mu&s;t leave part of it and come for it again. They made a halt and only laughed at me, and took part of my load and added it to a young &s;quaw's, who had as much before as I carried.</P>
<P>This kind of repoof had a greater tendency to excite me to exert my&s;elf in carrying without complaining, than if they had whipped me for lazine&s;s. After this the hunters held a council, and concluded that they mu&s;t have hor&s;es to carry their loads; and that they would go to war even in this inclement &s;ea&s;on, in order to bring in hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Tontileaugo wi&s;hed to be one of tho&s;e who &s;hould go to war; but the votes went again&s;t him, as he was one of our be&s;t hun|ters; it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to leave him at this winter camp to provide for the &s;quaws and children; it was agreed upon that Tontileaugo and three others &s;hould &s;tay, and hunt, and the other four go to war.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="036317_0019_100895C35F216410">They then began to go through their common ceremony. They &s;ung their war &s;ongs danced their war dances &amp;c. And when they were equipped they went off &s;inging their marching &s;ong, and firing their guns. Our camp appeared to be rejoic|ing; but I was grieved to think that &s;ome innocent per&s;ons would be murdered not thinking of danger.</P>
<P>After the departure of the&s;e warriors we had hard times; and tho we were not altogether out of provi&s;ions, we were brought to &s;hort allowance. At length Tontileaugo had con&s;i|derable &s;ucce&s;s; and we had meat brought into camp &s;ufficient to la&s;t ten days. Tontileaugo then took me with him in order to encamp &s;ome di&s;tance from this winter cabbin, to try his luck there. We carried no provi&s;ion with us, he &s;aid we would leave what was there for the &s;quaws and children, and that we could &s;hift for our&s;elves. We &s;teered about a fouth cour&s;e up the waters of this creek, and encamped about ten or twelve miles from the winter cabbin. As it was &s;till cold weather and a cru&s;t upon the &s;now, which made a noi&s;e as we walked and a|larmed the deer, we could kill nothing, and con&s;equently went to &s;leep without &s;upper. The only chance we had under the&s;e circum&s;tances, was to hunt bear holes; as the bears about Chri&s;t|mas &s;earch out a winter lodging place, where they lie about three or four months without eating or drinking.&mdash;This may appear to &s;ome incredible; but it is now well known to be the ca&s;e, by tho&s;e who live in the remote we&s;tern parts of North America.</P>
<P>The next morning early we proceeded on, and when we found a tree &s;cratched by the bears climbing up, and the hole in the tree &s;ufficiently large for the reception of the bear, we then fell a &s;apling or &s;mall tree, again&s;t or near the hole; and it was my bu&s;ine&s;s to climb up and drive out the bear, while Tontileau|go &s;tood ready with his gun and bow. We went on in this man|ner until evening, without &s;ucce&s;s; at length we found a large elm &s;cratched, and a hole in it about forty feet up; but no tree nigh &s;uitable to lodge again&s;t the hole. Tontileaugo got a long pole and &s;ome dry rotten wood which he tied in bunches, with bark, and as there was a tree that grew near the elm, and extended up near the hole; but leaned the wrong way; &s;o that we could not lodge it to advantage; but to remedy this incon|venience, he climed up this tree and carried with him his rot|ten wood, fire and pole. The rotten wood he tied to his belt, and to one end of the pole he tied a hook, and a piece of rotten wood which he &s;et fire to, as it would retain fire almo&s;t like &s;punk; and reached this hook from limb to limb as he went up; when he got up, with this pole he put dry wood on fire into the hole&punc; after he put in the fire he heard the bear &s;nuff and he came &s;pee|dily

down, took his gun in his hand and waited until the bear would come out; but it was &s;ome time before it appeared, and when it did appear, he attempted taking &s;ight with his rifle; but it being then too dark, to &s;ee the &s;ights, he &s;et it down by a tree, and in&s;tantly bent his bow, took hold of an arrow, and &s;hot the bear a little behind the &s;houlder; I was preparing al&s;o to &s;hoot an arrow, but he called to me to &s;top, there was no oc|ca&s;ion; and with that the bear fell to the ground.</P>
<P>Being very hungry we kindled a fire, opened the bear, took out the liver, and wrapped &s;ome of the caul fat round and put it on a wooden &s;pit which we &s;tuck in the ground by the fire to roa&s;t, we then &s;kinned the bear, got on our kettle, and had both roa&s;t and boiled, and al&s;o &s;auce to our meat, which appeared to me to be delicate fare. After I was fully &s;atisfied I went to &s;leep, Tontileaugo awoke me, &s;aying, come eat hearty, we have got meat plenty now.</P>
<P>The next morning we cut down a lynn tree, peeled bark and made a &s;nug little &s;helter, facing the &s;outh ea&s;t, with a large log betwixt us and the north we&s;t; we made a good fire before us, and &s;caffolded up our meat at one &s;ide.&mdash;When we had fini&s;h|ed our camp we went out to hunt, &s;earched two trees for bears, but to no purpo&s;e. As the &s;now thawed a little in the after|noon Tontileaugo killed a deer, which we carried with us to camp.</P>
<P>The next day we turned out to hunt, and near the camp we found a tree well &s;cratched; but the hole was above forty feet high, and no tree that we could lodge again&s;t the hole; but finding that it was very hollow, we concluded that we would cut down the tree with our tomahawks, which kept us working a con&s;iderable part of the day. When the tree fell we ran up, Tontileaugo with his gun and bow, and I with my bow ready bent. Tontileaugo &s;hot the bear through with his rifle, a little behind the &s;houlders, I al&s;o &s;hot, but too far back; and not be|ing then much accum&s;tomed to the bu&s;ine&s;s, my arrow penetra|ted only a few inches thro the &s;kin. Having killed an old &s;he bear and three cubs, we hawled her on the &s;now to the camp, and only had time afterwards, to get wood, make a fire, cook &amp;c. before dark.</P>
<P>Early the next morning we went to bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;earched &s;everal trees, but found no bears. On our way home we took three ra|coons out of a hollow elm, not far from the ground.</P>
<P>We remained here about two weeks, and in this time killed four bears, three deer, &s;everal turkeys, and a number of ra|coons. We packed up as much meat as we could carry, and returned to our winter cabin. On our arrival, there was great
<PB N="22" REF="036317_0021_1008DBD9B7239DA8">
joy, as they were all in a &s;tarving condition,&mdash;the three hun|ters that we had left having killed but very little.&mdash;All that could carry a pack repaired to our camp to bring in meat.</P>
<P>Some time in February the four warriors returned, who had taken two &s;calps, and &s;ix hor&s;es from the frontiers, of Penn&s;yl|vania. The hunters could then &s;catter out a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the winter cabin, and encamp, kill meat and pack it in upon hor&s;es; &s;o that we commonly after this had plenty of provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this month we began to make &s;ugar. As &s;ome of the elm bark will &s;trip at this &s;ea&s;on, the &s;quaws after finding a tree that would do, cut it down, and with a crooked &s;tick broad and &s;harp at the end, took the bark off the tree, and of this bark, made ve&s;&s;els in a curious manner, that would hold about two gallons each: they made above one hundred of the&s;e kind of ve&s;&s;els. In the &s;ugar-tree they cut a notch, &s;looping down, and at the end of the notch, &s;tuck in a tomahawk; in the place where they &s;tuck the tomahawk, they drove along chip, in order to carry the water out from the tree, and under this they &s;et their ve&s;&s;el, to receive it. As &s;ugar trees were plenty and large here, they &s;eldom or never notched a tree that was not two or three feet over. They al&s;o made bark ve&s;&s;els for carrying the water, that would hold about four gallons each. They had two bra&s;s kettles, that held about fifteen gallons each, and other &s;maller kettles in which they boiled the water. But as they could not at all times boil away the water as fa&s;t as it was collected, they made ve&s;&s;els of bark, that would hold about one hundred gallons each, for retaining the water; and tho' the &s;ugar trees did not run every day, they had always a &s;ufficient quantity of water to keep them boiling during the whole &s;ugar &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The way that we commonly u&s;ed our &s;ugar while encamped, was by putting it in bears fat until the fat was almo&s;t as &s;weet as the &s;ugar it&s;elf, and in this we dipped <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> roa&s;ted veni&s;on. About this time &s;ome of the Indian lads and my&s;elf, were em|ployed in making and attending traps for catching racoons, foxes, wild cats, &amp;c.</P>
<P>As the racoon is a kind of water animal, that frequents the runs, or &s;mall water-cour&s;es, almo&s;t the whole night, we made our traps on the runs, by laying one &s;mall &s;apling on another, and driving in po&s;ts to keep them from rolling. The upper &s;apling we rai&s;ed about eighteen inches, and &s;et &s;o, that on the racoons touching a &s;tring, or &s;mall piece of bark, the &s;apling would fall and kill it; and left the racoon &s;hould pa&s;s by, we laid bru&s;h on both &s;ides of the run, only leaving the channel o|pen.</P>
<P>The fox traps we made nearly in the &s;ame manner, at the
<PB N="23" REF="036317_0022_1008DBDB41E38158">
end of a hollow log, or oppo&s;ite to a hole at the root of a hollow tree, and put veni&s;on on a &s;tick for bait: we had it &s;o &s;et that when the fox took hold of the meat, the trap fell. While the &s;quaws were employed in making &s;ugar, the boys and men were engaged in hunting and trapping.</P>
<P>About the latter end of March we began to prepare for mov|ing into town, in order to plant corn: the &s;quaws were then fry|ing the la&s;t of their bears fat, and making ve&s;&s;els to hold it. the ve&s;&s;els were made of deer &s;kins, which were &s;kinned by pul|ling the &s;kin off the neck, without ripping. After they had ta|ken off the hair, they gathered it in &s;mall plaits round the neck and with a &s;tring drew it together like a pur&s;e: in the centre a pin was put, below which they tied a &s;tring, and while it was wet they blew it up like a bladder, and let it remain in this manner, until it was dry, when it appeared nearly in the &s;hape of a &s;ugar loaf, but more rounding at the lower end. One of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els would hold about four or five gallons; in the&s;e ve&s;|&s;els it was they carried their bears oil.</P>
<P>When all things were ready we moved back to the falls of Cane&s;adooharie. In this route the land is chiefly fir&s;t and &s;econd rate, but too much meadow ground, in proportion to the up land. The timber is white a&s;h, elm, black-oak, cherry, buckeye, &s;u|gar-tree, lynn, mulberry, beech, white-oak, hickory, wild ap|ple-tree, red-haw, black-haw, and &s;picewood bu&s;hes. There is in &s;ome places, &s;pots of beech timber, which &s;pots may be call|ed third rate land. Buckeye, &s;ugar-tree and &s;picewood, are common in the woods here. There is in &s;ome places, large &s;wamps too wet for any u&s;e.</P>
<P>On our arrival at the falls, (as we had brought with us on hor&s;e back, about two hundred weight of &s;ugar, a large quantity of bears oil, &s;kins &amp;c.) the canoe we had buried was not &s;uffici|ent to carry all; therefore we were obliged to make another one of elm bark. While we lay here a young Wiandot found my books: on this they collected together; I was a little way from the camp, and &s;aw the collection, but did not know what it meant. They called me by my Indian name, which was Scoouwa, repeatedly. I ran to &s;ee what was the matter, they &s;hewed me my books, and &s;aid they were glad they had been found, for they knew I was grieved at the lo&s;s of them, and that they now rejoiced with me becau&s;e they were found. As I could then &s;peak &s;ome Indian, e&s;pecially Caughnewaga (for both that and the Wiandot tongue were &s;poken in this camp) I told them that I thanked them for the kindne&s;s they had always &s;hewn to me, and al&s;o for finding my books. They a&s;ked if the books were damaged? I told them not much. They then &s;hew|ed how they lay, which was in the be&s;t manner to turn off the
<PB N="24" REF="036317_0023_1008DBDCCA3CC5F8">
water. In a deer &s;kin pouch they lay all winter. The print was not much injured, though the binding was.&mdash;This was the fir&s;t time that I felt my heart warm towards the Indians. Though they had been exceeding kind to me, I &s;till before de|te&s;ted them, on account of the barbarity I beheld after Braddock's defeat. Neither had I ever before pretended kindne&s;s, or ex|pre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in a friendly manner; but I began now to excu&s;e the Indians on account of their want of information.</P>
<P>When we were ready to embark, Tontileaugo would not go to town, but go up the river and take a hunt. He a&s;ked me if I choo&s;ed to go with him? I told him I did. We then got &s;ome &s;ugar, bears oil bottled up in a bear's gut, and &s;ome dry veni&s;on, which we packed up, and went up Cane&s;adooharie, about thir|ty miles, and encamped. At this time I did not know either the day of the week, or the month; but I &s;uppo&s;ed it to be a|bout the fir&s;t of April. We had con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s in our bu&s;i|ne&s;s. We al&s;o found &s;ome &s;tray hor&s;es, or a hor&s;e, mare, and a young colt; and though they had run in the woods all winter, they were in exceeding good order. There is plenty of gra&s;s here all winter, under the &s;now, and hor&s;es accu&s;tomed to the woods can work it out.&mdash;The&s;e hor&s;es had run in the woods un|til they were very wild.</P>
<P>Tontileaugo one night concluded that we mu&s;t run them down. I told him I thought we could not accompli&s;h it. He &s;aid he had run down bears, buffaloes and elks: and in the great plains, with only a &s;mall &s;now on the ground, he had run down a deer; and he thought that in one whole day, he could tire, or run down any four footed animal except a wolf. I told him that though a deer was the &s;wifte&s;t animal to run a &s;hort di&s;t|ance, yet it would tire &s;ooner than a hor&s;e. He &s;aid he would at all events try the experiment. He had heard the Wiandots &s;ay, that I could run well, and now he would &s;ee whether I could or not. I told him that I never had run all day, and of cour&s;e was not accu&s;tomed to that way of running. I never had run with the Wiandots, more than &s;even or eight miles at one time. He &s;aid that was nothing, we mu&s;t either catch the&s;e hor&s;es, or run all day.</P>
<P>In the morning early we left camp, and about &s;unri&s;e we &s;tar|ted after them, &s;triped naked excepting breech-clouts and mock|a&s;ons. About ten o'clock I lo&s;t &s;ight of both Tontileaugo and the hor&s;es, and did not &s;ee them again until about three o'clock in the afternoon. As the hor&s;es run all day, in about three or four miles &s;quare, at length they pa&s;&s;ed where I was, and I fell in clo&s;e after them. As I then had a long re&s;t, I endeavored to keep a head of Tontileaugo, and after &s;ome time I could hear him after me calling <HI>chakoh, chakoanaugh,</HI> which &s;ignifies, pull
<PB N="25" REF="036317_0024_1008DBDFCB027370">
away or do your be&s;t. We pur&s;ued on, and after &s;ome time Tontileaugo pa&s;&s;ed me, and about an hour before &s;undown, we de&s;paired of catching the&s;e hor&s;es and returned to camp where we had left our clothes.</P>
<P>I reminded Tontileaugo of what I had told him; he replied he did not know what hor&s;es could do. They are wonderful &s;trong to run; but withal we made them very tired. Tontileaugo then concluded, he would do as the Indians did with wild hor|&s;es, when out at war: which is to &s;hoot them through the neck under the mane, and above the bone, which will cau&s;e them to fall and lie until they can halter them, and then they recover again. This he attemped to do; but as the mare was very wild, he could not get &s;ufficiently nigh to &s;hoot her in the pro|per place; however he &s;hot, the ball pa&s;&s;ed too low, and killed her. As the hor&s;e and colt &s;tayed at this place we caught the hor&s;e, and took him and the colt with us to camp.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed at this camp about two weeks, and killed a num|ber of bears, racoons, and &s;ome beavers. We made a canoe of elm bark, and Tontileaugo embarked in it. He arrived at the falls that night; whil&s;t I, mounted on hor&s;e back, with a bear &s;kin &s;addle, and bark &s;tirrups, proceeded by land to the falls: I came there the next morning, and we carried our canoe and loading pa&s;t the falls.</P>
<P>The river is very rapid for &s;ome di&s;tance above the falls, which are about twelve or fifteen feet nearly perpendicular. This river, called Cane&s;adooharie, interlocks with the We&s;t branch of Mu&s;kingum, runs nearly a north cour&s;e, and empties into the &s;outh &s;ide of Lake Erie, about eighty miles ea&s;t from Sandu&s;ky, or betwixt Sandu&s;ky and Cayahaga.</P>
<P>On this la&s;t route the land is nearly the &s;ame, as that la&s;t de|&s;cribed, only there is not &s;o much &s;wampy or wet ground.</P>
<P>We again proceeded towards the lake, I on hor&s;e back, and Tontileaugo by water. Here the land is generally good, but I found &s;ome difficulty in getting round &s;wamps and ponds. When we came to the lake I proceeded along the &s;trand, and Tontileaugo near the &s;hore, &s;ometimes paddling and &s;ometimes polling his canoe along</P>
<P>After &s;ome time the wind aro&s;e, and he went into the mouth of a &s;mall creek and encamped. Here we &s;taid &s;everal days on account of high wind, which rai&s;ed the lake in great billows. While we were here Tontileaugo went out to hunt, and when he was gone a Wiandot came to our camp; I gave him a &s;houl|der of veni&s;on which I had by the fire well roa&s;ted, and he re|ceived it gladly, told me he was hungry, and thanked me for my kindne&s;s. When Tontileaugo came home, I told him that a Wiandot had been at camp, and that I gave him a &s;hounder of
<PB N="26" REF="036317_0025_1008DBE1CB5EF708">
roa&s;ted veni&s;on: he &s;aid that was very well, and I &s;uppo&s;e you gave him al&s;o &s;ugar and bears oil, to eat with his veni&s;on. I told him I did not; as the &s;ugar and bears oil was down in the canoe I did not go for it. He replied you have behaved ju&s;t like a Dutchman.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Dutch he called Skoharehaugo, which took its derivation from a Dutch &s;ettlement called Skoharey.</NOTE> Do you not know that when &s;trangers come to our camp, we ought always to give them the be&s;t that we have. I acknowledged that I was wrong. He &s;aid that he could excu&s;e this, as I was but young; but I mu&s;t learn to be|have like a warrior, and do great things, and never be found in any &s;uch little actions.</P>
<P>The lake being again calm,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The lake when calm, appears to be of a &s;ky blue colour; though when lift|ed in a ve&s;&s;el, it is like other clear water.</NOTE> we proceeded, and arrived &s;afe at Sunyendeand, which was a Wiandot town, that lay upon a &s;mall creek which empties into the Little Lake below the mouth of Sandu&s;ky.</P>
<P>The town was about eighty rood above the mouth of the creek, on the &s;outh &s;ide of a large plain, on which timber grew, and nothing more but gra&s;s or nettles. In &s;ome places there were large flats, where nothing but gra&s;s grew, about three feet high when grown, and in other places nothing but nettles, very rank, where the &s;oil is extremely rich and loo&s;e&mdash;here they planted corn. In this town there were al&s;o French traders, who purcha&s;ed our &s;kins and fur, and we all got new clothes, paint, tobacco, &amp;c.</P>
<P>After I had got my new clothes, and my head done off like a read-headed wood-pecker, I, in company with a number of young Indians, went down to the corn-field, to &s;ee the &s;quaws at work. When we came there, they a&s;ked me to take a hoe, which I did, and hoed for &s;ome time. The &s;quaws applauded me as a good hand at the bu&s;ine&s;s; but when I returned to the town, the old men hearing of what I had done, chid me, and &s;aid that I was adopted in the place of a great man, and mu&s;t not hoe corn like a &s;quaw. They never had occa&s;ion to re|prove me for any thing like this again; as I never was ex|tremely fond of work, I readily complied with their orders.</P>
<P>As the Indians on their return from their winter hunt, bring in with them large quantities of bears' oil, &s;ugar, dried veni&s;on, &amp;c. at this time they have plenty, and do not &s;pare eating or giving&mdash;thus they make way with their provi&s;ion as quick as po&s;&s;ible. They have no &s;uch thing as regular meals, breakfa&s;t, dinner or &s;upper; but if any one, even the town folks, would go to the &s;ame hou&s;e, &s;everal times in one day, he would be invited to eat of the be&s;t&mdash;and with them it is bad manners to refu&s;e to
<PB N="27" REF="036317_0026_1008DBE37B5F5358">
eat when it is offered. If they will not eat it is interpreted as a &s;ymptom of di&s;plea&s;ure, or that the per&s;ons refu&s;ing to eat, were angry with tho&s;e who invited them.</P>
<P>At this time homony plentifully mixed with bears' oil and &s;ugar; or dried veni&s;on, bears oil and &s;ugar, is what they offer to every one who comes in any time of the day; and &s;o they go on until their &s;ugar, bears oil and veni&s;on, is all gone, and then they have to eat homony by it&s;elf, without bread, &s;alt or any thing el&s;e; yet, &s;till they invite every one that comes in, to eat whil&s;t they have any thing to give. It is thought a &s;hame, not to invite people to eat, while they have any thing; but, if they can in truth, only &s;ay we have got nothing to eat, this is accepted as an honorable apology. All the hunters and war|riors continued in town about &s;ix weeks after we came in: they &s;pent this time in painting, going from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, eatings, &s;moking and playing at a game re&s;embling dice, or hu&s;tle-cap. They put a number of plumb-&s;tones in a &s;mall bowl; one &s;ide of each &s;tone is black, and the other white; they then &s;hake or hu&s;tle the bowl, calling, <HI>hits, hits, hits, honesey, honesey, rago, rago;</HI> which &s;ignifies calling for white or black, or what they wi&s;h to turn up; they then turn the bowl, and count the whites and blacks. Some were beating their kind of drum, and &s;ing|ing; others were employed in playing on a &s;ort of flute, made of hollow cane; and others playing on the jews-harp. Some part of this time was al&s;o taken up in attending the council hou&s;e, where the chiefs, and as many others as cho&s;e, attend|ed; and at night they were frequently employed in &s;inging and dancing. Towards the la&s;t of this time, which was in June 1756, they were all engaged in preparing to go to war again&s;t the frontiers of Virginia: when they were equipped, they went through their ceremonies, &s;ung their war &s;ongs, &amp;c. They all marched off, from fifteen to &s;ixty years of age; and &s;ome boys only twelve years old, were equipped with their bows and ar|rows, and went to war; &s;o that none were left in town but &s;quaws and children, except my&s;elf, one very old man, and an|other about fifty years of age, who was lame.</P>
<P>The Indians were then in great hopes that they would drive all the Virginians over the lake, which is all the name they know for the &s;ea. They had &s;ome cau&s;e for this hope, becau&s;e, at this time, the Americans were altogether unacquainted with war of any kind, and con&s;equently very unfit to &s;tand their hand with &s;uch &s;ubtil enemies as the Indians were. The two old Indians a&s;ked me if I did not think that the Indians and French would &s;ubdue all America, except New-England, which they &s;aid they had tried in old times. I told them I thought not: they &s;aid they had already drove them all out of the mountains,
<PB N="28" REF="036317_0027_1008DBE862890C98">
and had chiefly laid wa&s;te the great valley, betwixt the North and South mountain, from Potomack to James River, which is a con&s;iderable part of the be&s;t land in Virginia, Maryland and Penn&s;ylvania, and that the white people appeared to them like fools; they could neither guard again&s;t &s;urprize, run or fight. The&s;e they &s;aid were their rea&s;ons for &s;aying that they would &s;ubdue the whites. They a&s;ked me to offer my rea&s;ons for my opinion, and told me to &s;peak my mind freely. I told them that the white people to the Ea&s;t were very numerous, like the trees, and though they appeared to them to be fools, as they were not acquainted with their way of war, yet they were not fools; therefore after &s;ome time they will learn your mode of war, and turn upon you, or at lea&s;t defend them&s;elves. I found that the old men them&s;elves did not believe they could con|quer America, yet they were willing to propagate the idea, in order to encourage the young men to go to war.</P>
<P>When the warriors left this town we had neither meat &s;ugar or bears oil, left. All that we had then to live on was corn pounded into coar&s;e meal or &s;mall homony&mdash;this they boiled in water, which appeared like well thickened &s;oup, without &s;alt or any thing el&s;e. For &s;ome time, we had plenty of this kind of homony; at length we were brought to very &s;hort allow|ance, and as the warriors did not return as &s;oon as they ex|pected, we were in a &s;tarving condition, and but one gun in the town, and very little amunition. The old lame Wiandot con|cluded that he would go a hunting in a canoe, and take me with him, and try to kill deer in the water, as it was then watering time. We went up Sandu&s;ky a few miles, then turned up a creek, and encamped. We had lights prepared, as we were to hunt in the night, and al&s;o a piece of bark and &s;ome bu&s;hes &s;et up in the canoe, in order to conceal our&s;elves from the deer. A little boy that was with us, held the light, I worked the ca|noe, and the old man, who had his gun loaded with large &s;hot, when we came near the deer, fired, and in this manner killed three deer, in part of one night. We went to our fire, ate heartily, and in the morning returned to town, in order to re|lieve the hungry and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>When we came to town, the children were crying bitterly on account of pinching hunger. We delivered what we had taken, and though it was but little among &s;o many, it was divi|ded according to the &s;tricte&s;t rules of ju&s;tice. We immediate|ly &s;et out for another hunt, but before we returned a part of the warriors had come in, and brought with them on hor&s;e-back, a quantity of meat. The&s;e warriors had divided into different parties, and all &s;truck at different places in Augu&s;ta county. They brought in with them a con&s;iderable number of &s;calps,
<PB N="29" REF="036317_0028_1008DBED92A04B98">
pri&s;oners, hor&s;es, and other plunder. One of the parties brought in with them, one Arthur Campbell, that is now Col. Campbell, who lives on Hol&s;ton River, near the Royal-Oak. As the Wiandots at Sunyendeand, and tho&s;e at Detroit were connected, Mr. Campbell was taken to Detroit; but he remain|ed &s;ome time with me in this town: his company was very agreeable, and I was &s;orry when he left me. During his &s;tay at Sunyendeand he borrowed my Bible, and made &s;ome perti|nent remarks on what he had read. One pa&s;&s;age was where it is &s;aid, "It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth." He &s;aid we ought to be re&s;igned to the will of Provi|kence, as we were now bearing the yoke, in our youth. Mr. Campbell appeared to be then about &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years of age.</P>
<P>There was a number of pri&s;oners brought in by the&s;e parties and when they were to run the gauntlet, I went and told them how they were to act. One John Savage, was brought in, a middle aged man, or about forty years old. He was to run the gauntlet. I told him what he had to do; and after this I fell into one of the ranks with the Indians, &s;houting and yelling like them; and as they were not very &s;evere on him, as he pa&s;&s;ed me, I hit him with a piece of a pumpkin&mdash;which plea&s;ed the Indians much, but hurt my feelings.</P>
<P>About the time that the&s;e warriors came in, the green corn, was beginning to be of u&s;e; &s;o that we had either green corn or veni&s;on, and &s;ometimes both&mdash;which was comparatively, high living. When we could have plenty of green corn, or roa&s;ting-ears, the hunters became lazy, and &s;pent their time as already mentioned, in &s;inging and dancing &amp;c. They appeared to be fulfilling the &s;criptures beyond tho&s;e who profe&s;s to be|lieve them, in that of taking no thought of to-morrow: and al&s;o in living in love, peace and friend&s;hip together, with|out di&s;putes. In this re&s;pect, they &s;hame tho&s;e who profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>In this manner we lived, until October, then the gee&s;e, &s;wans, ducks, cranes, &amp;c. came from the north, and alighted on this lit|tle Lake, without number or innumerable. Sunyendeand is a remarkable place for fi&s;h, in the &s;pring, and fowl both in the fall and &s;pring.</P>
<P>As our hunters were now tired with indolence, and fond of their own kind of exerci&s;e, they all turned out to fowling, and in this could &s;carce mi&s;s of &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o that we had now plenty of homony and the be&s;t of fowls; and &s;ometimes as a rarity we had a little bread, which was made of Indian corn meal, pound|ed
<PB N="30" REF="036317_0029_1008DBF1159ED5F8">
in a homony-block, mixed with boiled beans, and baked in cakes under the a&s;hes.</P>
<P>This, with us was called good living, though not equal to our fat, roa&s;ted and boiled veni&s;on, when we went to the woods in the fall; or bears meat and beaver in the winter; or &s;ugar, bears oil, and dry veni&s;on in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>Some time in October, another adopted brother, older than Tontileaugo, came to pay us a vi&s;it at Sunyendeand, and he a&s;ked me to take a hunt with him on Cayahaga. As they al|ways u&s;ed me as a free man, and gave me the liberty of choo&s;ing, I told him that I was attached to Tontileaugo&mdash;had never &s;een him before, and therefore, a&s;ked &s;ometime to con&s;ider of this. He told me that the party he was going with would not be a|long, or at the mouth of this little lake, in le&s;s than &s;ix days, and I could in this time be acquainted with him, and judge for my&s;elf. I con&s;ulted with Tontileaugo on this occa&s;ion, and he told me that our old brother Tecaughretanego, (which was his name) was a chief, and a better man than he was; and if I went with him I might expect to be well u&s;ed, but he &s;aid I might do as I plea&s;ed; and if I &s;taid he would u&s;e me as he had done. I told him that he had acted in every re&s;pect, as a brother to me; yet I was much plea&s;ed with my old brother's conduct and conver&s;ation; and as he was going to a part of the country I had never been in, I wi&s;hed to go with him&mdash;he &s;aid that he was perfectly willing.</P>
<P>I then went with Tecaughretanego, to the mouth of the little lake, where he met with the company he intended going with, which was compo&s;ed of, Caughnewagas, and Ottawas.&mdash; Here I was introduced to a Caughnewaga &s;i&s;ter, and others I had never before &s;een. My &s;i&s;ter's name was Mary, which they pronounced <HI>Maully.</HI> I a&s;ked Tecaughretanego how it came that &s;he had an Engli&s;h name; he &s;aid that he did not know that it was an Engli&s;h name; but it was the name the prie&s;t gave her when &s;he was baptized, which he &s;aid was the name of the mother of Je&s;us. He &s;aid there were a great many of the Caughnewagas and Wiandots, that were a kind of half Roman-Catholics; but as for him&s;elf, he &s;aid, that the prie&s;t and him could not agree; as they held notions that contradicted both &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, and had the a&s;&s;urance to tell him, that the book of God, taught them the&s;e fooli&s;h ab&s;urdities: but he could not believe the great and good &s;pirit ever taugh them any &s;uch non&s;en&s;e: and therefore he concluded that the Indians' old re|ligion was better than this new way of wor&s;hiping God.</P>
<P>The Ottawas have a very u&s;eful kind of tents which they carry with them, made of flags, plaited and &s;titched together in a very artful manner, &s;o as to turn rain, or wind well,&mdash;each
<PB N="31" REF="036317_0030_1008DBF4100D67D0">
mat is made fifteen feet long, and about five feet broad. In or|der to erect this kind of tent, they cut a number of long &s;trait poles, which they drive in the ground, in form of a circle, lean|ing inwards; then they &s;pread the matts on the&s;e poles,&mdash;be|ginning at the bottom and extending up, leaving only a hole in the top uncovered&mdash;and this hole an&s;wers the place of a chim|ney. They make a fire of dry &s;plit wood, in the middle, and &s;pread down bark mats and &s;kins for bedding, on which they &s;leep in a crooked po&s;ture, all round the fire, as the length of their beds will not admit of &s;tretching them&s;elves. In place of a door they lift up one end of a mat and creep in, and let the mat fall down behind them.</P>
<P>The&s;e tents are warm and dry, and tolerable clear of &s;moke. Their lumber they keep under birch-bark canoes, which they carry out and turn up for a &s;helter, where they keep every thing from the rain. Nothing is in the tents but them&s;elves and their bedding.</P>
<P>This company had four birch canoes and four tents. We were kindly received, and they gave us plenty of homony, and wild fowl, boiled and roa&s;ted. As the gee&s;e, ducks, &s;wans, &amp;c. here are well grain-fed, they were remarkably fat e&s;pecially the green necked ducks.</P>
<P>The wild fowl here, feed upon a kind of wild rice, that grows &s;pontaneou&s;ly in the &s;hallow water, or wet places along the &s;ides or in the corners of the lakes.</P>
<P>As the wind was high and we could not proceed on our voy|age, we remained here &s;everal days, and killed abundance of wild fowl, and a number of racoons.</P>
<P>When a company of Indians are moving together on the lake, as it is at this time of the year often dangerous &s;ailing, the old men hold a council; and when they agree to embark, every one is engaged immediately in making ready, without of|fering one word again&s;t the mea&s;ure, though the lake may be boi&s;terous and horrid. One morning tho' the wind appeared to me to be as high as in days pa&s;t, and the billows raging, yet the call was given <HI>yohoh-yohoh,</HI> which was quickly an&s;wered by all &mdash;ooh-ooh which &s;ignifies agreed. We were all in&s;tantly enga|ged in preparing to &s;tart, and had con&s;iderable difficulties in embarking.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we got into our canoes we fell to paddling with all our might, making out from the &s;hore. Though the&s;e &s;ort of canoes ride waves beyond what could be expected, yet the wa|ter &s;everal times da&s;hed into them. When we got out about half a mile from &s;hore, we hoi&s;ted &s;ail, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it was nearly a we&s;t wind, we then &s;eemed to ride the waves with ea&s;e, and went on at a rapid rate. We then all laid down our paddles,
<PB N="32" REF="036317_0031_1008DBF721ECD080">
excepting one that &s;teered, and there was no water da&s;hed into our canoes, until we came near the &s;hore again. We &s;ailed a|bout &s;ixty miles that day, and encamped &s;ome time before night.</P>
<P>The next day we again embarked and went on very well for &s;ome time; but the lake being boi&s;terous, and the wind not fair, we were obliged to make to &s;hore, which we accompli&s;hed with hard work and &s;ome difficulty in landing.&mdash;The next morning a council was held by the old men.</P>
<P>As we had this day to pa&s;s by a long precipice of rocks, on the &s;hore about nine miles, which rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for us to land, though the wind was high and the lake rough; yet, as it was fair, we were all ordered to embark. We wrought our&s;elves out from the &s;hore and hoi&s;ted &s;ail (what we u&s;ed in place of &s;ail cloth, were our tent mats, which an&s;wered the place very well) and went on for &s;ome time with a fair wind, until we were oppo&s;ite to the precipice, and then it turned to|wards the &s;hore, and we began to fear we &s;hould be ca&s;t upon the rocks. Two of the canoes were con&s;iderably farther out from the rocks, than the canoe I was in. Tho&s;e who were farthe&s;t out in the lake did not let down their &s;ails until they had pa&s;&s;ed the precipice; but as we were nearer the rock, we were obliged to lower our &s;ails, and paddle with all our might. With much difficulty we cleared our&s;elves of the rock, and landed. As the other canoes had landed before us, there were immediately runners &s;ent off to &s;ee if we were all &s;afely landed.</P>
<P>This night the wind fell, and the next morning the lake was tolerably calm, and we embarked without difficulty, and paddled along near the &s;hore, until we came to the mouth of Cayahaga, which empties into Lake Erie on the &s;outh &s;ide, betwixt Cane|&s;adooharie, and Pre&s;q'I&s;le.</P>
<P>We turned up Cayahaga and encamped&mdash;where we &s;taid and hunted for &s;everal days; and &s;o we kept moving and hun|ting until we came to the forks of Cayahaga.</P>
<P>This is a very gentle river, and but few riffles, or &s;wift run|ning places, from the mouth to the forks. Deer here were tol|erably plenty, large and fat; but bear and other game &s;carce. The upland is hilly, a principally &s;econd and third rate land. The timber chiefly black-oak, white-oak, hickory, dogwood &amp;c. The bottoms are rich and large, and the timber is walnut, lo|cu&s;t, mulberry, &s;ugar-tree, red-haw, black-haw, wild-appletrees &amp;c. The We&s;t Branch of this river interlocks with the Ea&s;t Branch of Mu&s;kingum; and the Ea&s;t Branch with the Big Bea|ver creek, that empties into the Ohio about thirty miles below Pitt&s;burgh.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="036317_0032_1008DBFA232BB538">From the forks of Cayahaga to the Ea&s;t Branch of Mu&s;kingum, there is a carrying place, where the Indians carry their canoes &amp;c. from the waters of Lake Erie, into the waters of the O|hio.</P>
<P>From the forks I went over with &s;ome hunters, to the Ea&s;t Branch of Mu&s;kingum, where they killed &s;everal deer, a num|ber of beavers, and returned heavy laden, with &s;kins and meat, which we carried on our backs, as we had no hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The land here is chiefly &s;econd and third rate, and the tim|ber chiefly oak and hickory. A little above the forks, on the Ea&s;t Branch of Cayahaga, are con&s;iderable rapids, very rocky, for &s;ome di&s;tance; but no perpendicular falls.</P>
<P>About the fir&s;t of December, 1756, we were preparing for leaving the river: we buried our canoes, and as u&s;ual hung up our &s;kins, and every one had a pack to carry: the &s;quaws al&s;o packed up their tents, which they carried in large rolls, that extended up above their heads; and though a great bulk, yet not heavy. We &s;teered about a &s;outh ea&s;t cour&s;e and could not march over ten miles per day. At night we lodged in our flag tents, which when erected, were nearly in the &s;hape of a &s;ugar loaf, and about fifteen feet diameter at the ground.</P>
<P>In this manner we proceeded about forty miles, and wintered in the&s;e tents, on the waters of Beaver creek, near a little lake or large pond, which is about two miles long, and one broad, and a remarkable plate for beaver.</P>
<P>It is a received opinion among the Indians, that the gee&s;e turn to beavers, and the &s;nakes to racoons; and though Te|caughretanego, who was a wi&s;e man, was not fully per&s;uaded that this was true; yet he &s;eemed in &s;ome mea&s;ure to be car|ried away with this whim&s;ical notion. He &s;aid that this pond had been always a plentiful place of beaver. Though he &s;aid he knew them to be frequently all killed, (as he thought;) yet the next winter they would be as plenty as ever. And as the beaver was an animal that did not travel by land, and there be|ing no water communication, to, or from this pond&mdash;how could &s;uch a number of beavers get there year after year? But as this pond was al&s;o a con&s;iderable place for gee&s;e, when they came in the fall from the north, and alighted in this pond, they turned beavers, all but the feet, which remained nearly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, that though there was no water communication, in, or out of this pond; yet it appeared that it was fed by &s;prings, as it was always clear and never &s;tagnated: and as a very large &s;pring ro&s;e about a mile below this pond, it was likely that this &s;pring came from this pond. In the fall when this &s;pring is cormparatively low there would be air under ground
<PB N="34" REF="036317_0033_1008DBFE66F52CD0">
&s;ufficient for the beavers to breathe in, with their heads above water, for they cannot live long under water, and &s;o they might have a &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age by water into this pond.&mdash;Te|caughretanego, granted that it might be &s;o.</P>
<P>About the &s;ides of this pond there grew great abundance of cranberries, which the Indians gathered up on the ice, when the pond was frozen over. The&s;e berries were about as large as rifle bullets&mdash;of a bright red color&mdash;an agreeable &s;our, though rather too &s;our of them&s;elves; but when mixed with &s;ugar, had a very agreeable ta&s;te.</P>
<P>In conver&s;ation with Tecaughretanego, I happened to be talking of the beavers' catching fi&s;h. He a&s;ked me why I thought that the beaver caught fi&s;h? I told him that I had read or the beaver making dams for the conveniency of fi&s;hing. He laughed, and made game of me and my book. He &s;aid the man that wrote that book knew nothing about the beaver. The beaver never did eat fle&s;h of any kind; but lived on the bark of trees, roots, and other vegetables.</P>
<P>In order to know certainly how this was, when we killed a beaver I carefully examined the inte&s;tines but found no ap|pearance of fi&s;h; I afterwards made an experiment on a pet beaver which we had, and found that it would neither eat fi&s;h or fle&s;h; therefore I acknowledged that the book I had read was wrong.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him if the beaver was an amphibious animal, or if it could live under water? He &s;aid that the beaver was a kind of &s;ubterraneous water animal, that lives in or near the water; but they were no more amphibious than the ducks and gee&s;e were&mdash;which was con&s;tantly proven to be the ca&s;e; as all the beavers that are caught in &s;teel traps are drowned, provided the trap be heavy enough to keep them under water. As the beaver does not eat fi&s;h, I enquired of Tecaughretanego why the beaver made &s;uch large dams? He &s;aid they were of u&s;e to them in various re&s;pects&mdash;both for their &s;afety and food. For their &s;afety, as by rai&s;ing the water over the mouths of their holes, or &s;ubterraneous lodging places, they could not be ea&s;ily found: and as the beaver feeds chiefly on the bark of trees, by rai&s;ing the water over the banks, they can cut down &s;applings for bark to feed upon without going out much upon the land: and when they are obliged to go out on land for this food they frequently are caught by the wolves. As the beaver can run upon land, but little fa&s;ter than a water tortoi&s;e, and is no fight|ing animal, if they are any di&s;tance from the water they become an ea&s;y prey to their enemies.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked Tecaughretanego, what was the u&s;e of the beaver's &s;tones, or glands, to them;&mdash;as the &s;he beaver has two pair&punc;
<PB N="35" REF="036317_0034_1008DC0162FC3CE0">
which is commonly called the oil &s;tones, and the bark &s;tones? He &s;aid that as the beavers are the dumbe&s;t of all animals, and &s;carcely ever make any noi&s;e; and as they were working crea|tures, they made u&s;e of this &s;mell in order to work in concert. If an old beaver was to come on the bank and rub his breech upon the ground, and rai&s;e a perfume, the others will collect from different places and go to work: this is al&s;o of u&s;e to them in travelling, that they may thereby &s;earch out and find their company. Cunning hunters finding this out, have made u&s;e of it again&s;t the beaver, in order to catch them. What is the bait which you &s;ee them make u&s;e of, but a compound of the oil and bark &s;tones? By this perfume, which is only a fal&s;e &s;ignal they decoy them to the trap.</P>
<P>Near this pond, beaver was the principal game. Before the the waters froze up, we caught a great many with wooden and &s;teel traps: but after that, we hunted the beaver on the ice. Some places here the beavers build large hou&s;es to live in; and in other places they have &s;ubterraneous lodgings in the banks. Where they lodge in the ground we have no chance of hunting them on the ice; but where they have hou&s;es we go with malls and hand&s;pikes, and break all the hollow ice, to prevent them from getting their heads above the water under it. Then we break a hole in the hou&s;e and they make their e&s;cape into the water; but as they cannot live long under water, they are obliged to go to &s;ome of tho&s;e broken places to breathe, and the Indians commonly put in their hands, catch them by the hind leg, hawl them on the ice, and tomahawk them. Sometimes they &s;hoot them in the head, when they rai&s;e it above the water. I a&s;ked the Indians if they were not afraid to catch the bea|vers with their hands? they &s;aid no: they were not much of a biting creature; yet if they would catch them by the fore foot they would bite.</P>
<P>I went out with Tecaughretanego, and &s;ome others a beaver hunting: but we did not &s;ucceed, and on our return we &s;aw where &s;everal racoons had pa&s;&s;ed, while the &s;now was &s;oft; tho' there was now a cru&s;t upon it, we all made a halt looking at the racoon tracks. As they &s;aw a tree with a hole in it they told me to go and &s;ee if they had gone in thereat; and if they had to halloo, and they would come and take them out. When I went to that tree, I found they had gone pa&s;t; but I &s;aw ano|ther the way they had went, and proceeded to examine that, and found they had gone up it. I then began to holloo, but could have no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>As it began to &s;now and blow mo&s;t violently, I returned and proceeded after my company, and for &s;ome time could &s;ee their tracks; but the old &s;now being only about three inches deep,
<PB N="36" REF="036317_0035_1008DC02E938F2B0">
and a cru&s;t upon it, the pre&s;ent driving &s;now &s;oon filled up the tracks. As I had only a bow, arrows and tomahawk, with me, and no way to &s;trike fire, I appeared to be in a di&s;mal &s;ituation&mdash;and as the air was dark with &s;now, I had little more pro&s;pect of &s;teering my cour&s;e, than I would in the night. At length I came to a hollow tree, with a hole at one &s;ide that I could go in at. I went in, and found that it was a dry place, and the hollow about three feet diameter, and high enough for me to &s;tand in. I found that there was al&s;o a con&s;iderable quanti|ty of &s;oft, dry rotten wood, around this hollow: I therefore concluded that I would lodge here; and that I would go to work, and &s;top up the door of my hou&s;e. I &s;tripped off my blanket, (which was all the clothes that I had, excepting a breech-clout, leggins and mocka&s;ons,) and with my tomahawk, fell to chopping at the top of a fallen tree that lay near and carried wood and &s;et it up on end again&s;t the door, until I had it three or four feet thick, all round, excepting a hole I had left to creep in at. I had a block prepared that I could hawl after me, to &s;top this hole: and before I went in I put in a number of &s;mall &s;ticks, that I might more effectually &s;top it on the in&s;ide. When I went in, I took my tomahawk and cut down all the dry rotten wood I could get, and beat it &s;mall. With it I made a bed like a goo&s;e-ne&s;t or hog-bed, and with the &s;mall &s;ticks &s;topped every hole, until my hou&s;e was almo&s;t dark. I &s;tripped off my mocka&s;ons, and danced in the centre of my bed for about half an hour, in order to warm my&s;elf. In this time my feet and whole body were agreeably warmed. The &s;now, in the mean while, had &s;topped all the holes, &s;o that my hou&s;e was as dark as a dungeon; though I knew it could not yet be dark out of doors. I then coiled my&s;elf up in my blanket, lay down in my little round bed, and had a tolerable nights lodging. When I awoke, all was dark&mdash;not the lea&s;t glimmering of light was to be &s;een. Immediately I recollected that I was not to expect light in this new habitation, as there was neither door nor win|dow in it. As I could hear the &s;torm raging, and did not &s;uffer much cold, as I was then &s;ituated, I concluded I would &s;tay in my ne&s;t until I was certain it was day. When I had rea&s;on to conclude that it &s;urely was day, I aro&s;e and put on my mock|a&s;ons, which I had laid under my head to keep from Freezing. I then endeavored to find the door, and had to do all by the &s;en&s;e of feeling, which took me &s;ome time. At length I found the block, but it being heavy, and a large quantity of &s;now, ha|ving fallen on it, at the fir&s;t attempt I did not move it. I then felt terrified&mdash;among all the hard&s;hips I had &s;u&s;tained, I never knew before, what it was to be thus deprived of light. This, with the other circum&s;tances attending it, appeared grievous.
<PB N="37" REF="036317_0036_1008DC0482B29510">
I went &s;traightway to bed again, wrapped my blanket round me, and lay and mu&s;ed awhile, and then prayed to almighty God to direct and protect me, as he had done heretofore. I once again attempted to move away the block, which proved &s;ucce&s;sful: it moved about nine inches&mdash;With this a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;now fell in from above, and I immediately received light, &s;o that I found a very great &s;now had fallen, above what I had ever &s;een in one night. I then knew why I could not ea&s;ily move the block, and I was &s;o rejoiced at obtaining the light, that all my other difficulties &s;eemed to vani&s;h. I then turned into my cell, and returned God thanks for having once more received the light of Heaven. At length I belted my blanket about me, got my tomahawk, bow and arrows, and went out of my den.</P>
<P>I was now in tolerable high &s;pirits, tho' the &s;now had fall|en above three feet deep, in addition to what was on the ground before; and the only imperfect guide I had, in order to &s;teer my cour&s;e to camp, was the trees; as the mo&s;s generally grows on the north-we&s;t &s;ide of them, if they are &s;traight. I proceeded on, wading through the &s;now, and about twelve o'clock (as it appeared afterwards, from that time to night, for it was yet cloudy,) I came upon the creek that our camp was on, about half a mile below the camp; and when I came in &s;ight of the camp, I found that there was great joy, by the &s;houts and yel|ling of the boys, &amp;c.</P>
<P>When I arrived, they all came round me, and received me gladly; but at this time no que&s;tions were a&s;ked, and I was ta|ken into a tent, where they gave me plenty of fat beaver meat, and then a&s;ked me to &s;moke. When I had done, Tecaughreta|nego de&s;ired me to walk out to a fire they had made. I went out, and they all collected round me, both men women and boys. Tecaughretanego a&s;ked me to give them a particular account of what had happened from the time they left me ye&s;|terday, until now. I told them the whole of the &s;tory, and they never interrupted me; but when I made a &s;top, the in|tervals were filled with loud acclamations of joy. As I could not, at this time, talk Ottawa or Jibewa well, (which is nearly the &s;ame) I delivered my &s;tory in Caughnewaga. As my &s;i&s;ter Molly's hu&s;band was a Jibewa and could under&s;tand Caugh|newaga, he acted as interpreter, and delivered my &s;tory to the Jibewas and Ottawas, which they received with plea&s;ure. When all this was done, Tecauretanego made a &s;peech to me in the following manner:</P>
<P><HI>"Brother,</HI></P>
<P>"You &s;ee we have prepared &s;now-&s;hoes to go after you, and
<PB N="38" REF="036317_0037_1008DC081F7E6C78">
were almo&s;t ready to go, when you appeared; yet, as you had not been accu&s;tomed to hard&s;hips in your country, to the ea&s;t, we never expected to &s;ee you alive. Now, we are glad to &s;ee you, in various re&s;pects: we are glad to &s;ee you on your own account; and we are glad to &s;ee the pro&s;pect of your filling the place of a great man, in who&s;e room you were adopted. We do not blame you for what has happened, we blame our&s;elves; becau&s;e, we did not think of this driving &s;now filling up the tracks, until after we came to camp.</P>
<P><HI>"Brother,</HI></P>
<P>"Your conduct on this occa&s;ion hath plea&s;ed us much: You have given us an evidence of your fortitude, &s;kill and re&s;olu|tion: and we hope you will always go on to do great actions, as it is only great actions that can make a great man."</P>
<P>I told my brother Tecaughretanego, that I thanked them for their care of me, and for the kindne&s;s I always received. I told him that I always wi&s;hed to do great actions, and hoped I never would do any thing to di&s;honor any of tho&s;e with whom I was connected. I likewi&s;e told my Jibewa brother-in-law to tell his people that I al&s;o thanked them for their care and kind|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The next morning &s;ome of the hunters went out on &s;now-&s;hoes, killed &s;everal deer, and hauled &s;ome of them into camp upon the &s;now. They fixed their carrying &s;trings, (which are broad in the middle, and &s;mall at each end,) in the fore feet and no&s;e of the deer, and laid the broad part of it on their heads or about their &s;houlders, and pulled it along; and when it is mov|ing, will not &s;ink in the &s;now much deeper than a &s;now-&s;hoe; and when taken with the grain of the hair, &s;lips along very ea&s;y.</P>
<P>The &s;now-&s;hoes are made like a hoop net, and wrought with buck-&s;kin thongs. Each &s;hoe is about two feet and an half long, and about eighteen inches broad, before, and &s;mall behind, with cro&s;s bars, in order to fix or tie them to their feet. Af|ter the &s;now had lay a few days, the Indians tomahawked the deer, by pur&s;uing them in this manner.</P>
<P>About two weeks after this, there came a warm rain, and took away the chief part of the &s;now, and broke up the ice: then we engaged in making wooden traps to catch beavers, as we had but few &s;teel traps. The&s;e traps are made nearly in the &s;ame manner as the racoon traps already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>One day as I was looking after my traps, I got benighted, by beaver ponds intercepting my way to camp; and as I had neglected to take fire-works with me, and the weather very cold, I could find no &s;uitable lodging place, therefore the only expedient I could think of to keep my&s;elf from freezing, was exerci&s;e. I danced and halloo'd the whole night with all my
<PB N="39" REF="036317_0038_1008DC0C67896238">
might, and the next day came to camp. Though I &s;uffered much more this time than the other night I lay out, yet the Indians were not &s;o much concerned, as they thought I had fire works with me; but when they knew how it was, they did not blame me. They &s;aid that old hunters were frequently involv|ed in this place, as the beaver dams were one above another on every creek and run, &s;o that it is hard to find a fording place. They applauded me for my fortitude, and &s;aid as they had now plenty of beaver-&s;kins, they would purcha&s;e me a new gun at Detroit, as we were to go there the next &s;pring; and then if I &s;hould chance to be lo&s;t in dark weather, I could make fire, kill provi&s;ion, and return to camp when the &s;un &s;hined. By being bewildered on the waters of Mu&s;kingum, I lo&s;t repute, and was reduced to the bow and arrow; and by lying out two nights here, I regained my credit.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time the waters all froze again, and then, as for|merly, we hunted beavers on the ice. Though beaver meat, without &s;alt or bread, was the chief of our food this winter, yet we had always plenty, and I was well contented with my diet, as it appeared delicious fare, after the way we had lived the winter before.</P>
<P>Sometime in February, we &s;caffolded up our fur and &s;kins, and moved about ten miles in que&s;t of a &s;ugar camp, or a &s;uitable place to make &s;ugar, and encamped in a large bottom, on the head waters of Big Beaver creek. We had &s;ome difficulty in moving, as we had a blind Caughnewaga boy about 15 years of age, to lead; and as this country is very bru&s;hy we frequently had him to carry;&mdash;We had al&s;o my Jibewa brother-in-law's fa|ther with us, who was thought by the Indians to be a great con|juror&mdash;his name was Manetohcoa&mdash;this old man was &s;o decre|pit, that we had to carry him this route upon a bier,&mdash;and all our baggage to pack on our backs.</P>
<P>Shortly after we came to this place the &s;quaws began to make &s;ugar. We had no large kettles with us this year, and they made the fro&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;upply the place of fire, in making &s;ugar. Their large bark ve&s;&s;els, for holding the &s;tock-water, they made broad and &s;hallow; and as the weather is very cold here, it frequently freezes at night in &s;ugar time; and the ice they break and ca&s;t out of the ve&s;&s;els. I a&s;ked them if they were not throwing away the &s;ugar? they &s;aid no: it was water they were ca&s;ting away, &s;ugar did not freeze, and there was &s;carcely any in that ice. They &s;aid I might try the experiment, and boil &s;ome of it, and &s;ee what I would get. I never did try it; but I ob&s;erved that after &s;everal times freez|ing, the water that remained in the ve&s;&s;el, changed its color and became brown and very &s;weet.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="036317_0039_1008DC11053D4348">About the time we were done making &s;ugar the &s;now went off the ground; and one night a &s;quaw rai&s;ed an alarm. She &s;aid &s;he &s;aw two men with guns in their hands, upon the bank on the other &s;ide of the creek, &s;pying our tents&mdash;they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be John&s;ton's Mohawks. On this the &s;quaws were ordered to &s;lip quietly out, &s;ome di&s;tance into the bu&s;hes; and all who had either guns or bows were to &s;quat in the bu&s;hes near the tents; and if the enemy ru&s;hed up, we were to give them the fir&s;t fire, and let the &s;quaws have an opportunity of e|&s;caping. I got down be&s;ide Tecaughretanego, and he whi&s;pered to me not to be afraid, for he would &s;peak to the Mohawks, and as they &s;pake the &s;ame tongue that we did, they would not hurt the Caughnewagas, or me: but they would kill all the Jibewas and Ottawas that they could, and take us along with them. This news plea&s;ed me well, and I heartily wi&s;hed for the ap|proach of the Mohawks.</P>
<P>Before we withdrew from the tents they had carried Mane|tohcoa, to the fire and gave him his conjuring tools, which were dyed feathers, the bone of the &s;houlder blade of a wild cat, tobacco &amp;c. and while we were in the bu&s;hes, Manetohcoa was in a tent at the fire, conjuring away to the utmo&s;t of his abili|ty. At length he called aloud for us all to come in, which was quickly obeyed. When we came in, he told us that after he had gone through the whole of his ceremony, and expected to &s;ee a number of Mohawks on the flat bone when it was warmed at the fire, the pictures of two wolves only appeared. He &s;aid tho there were no Mohawks about, we mu&s;t not be angry with the &s;quaw for giving a fal&s;e alarm; as &s;he had occa&s;ion to go out and happened to &s;ee the wolves, though it was moon light; yet &s;he got afraid, and &s;he conceited it was Indians, with guns in their hands, &s;o he &s;aid we might all go to &s;leep for there was no danger&mdash;and accordingly we did.</P>
<P>The next morning we went to the place, and found wolf tracks, and where they had &s;cratched with their feet like dogs; but there was no &s;ign of mocka&s;on tracks. If there is any &s;uch thing as a wizzard, I think Manetohcoa was as likely to be one, as any man, as he was a profe&s;&s;ed wor&s;hiper of the devil.&mdash;But let him be a conjuror or not, I am per&s;uaded that the Indians believed what he told them upon this occa&s;ion, as well as if it had come from an infallible oracle; or they would not after &s;uch an alarm as this, go all to &s;leep in an unconcerned man|ner. This appeared to me the mo&s;t like witchcraft, of any thing I beheld while I was with them. Though I &s;crutinized their proceedings in bu&s;ine&s;s of this kind; yet I generally found that their pretended witchcraft, was either art or mi&s;taken no|tions whereby they deceived them&s;elves.&mdash;Before a battle they
<PB N="41" REF="036317_0040_1008DC129A2AF598">
&s;py the enemy's motions carefully, and when they find that they can have con&s;iderable advantage, and the greate&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, then the old men pretend to conjure, or to tell what the event will be,&mdash;and this they do in a figurative manner, which will bear &s;omething of a different interpretation, which generally comes to pa&s;s nearly as they foretold; therefore the young warriors generally believed the&s;e old conjurors, which had a tendency to animate, and excite them to pu&s;h on with vigor.</P>
<P>Some time in March 1757 we began to move back to the forks of Cayahaga, which was about forty or fifty miles; and as we had no hor&s;es, we had all our baggage and &s;everal hun|dred weight of beaver &s;kins, and &s;ome deer and bear &s;kins&mdash;all to pack on our backs. The method we took to accompli&s;h this was by making &s;hort day's journies. In the morning we would move on with as much as we were able to carry, about five miles, and encamp; and then run back for more. We com|monly made three &s;uch trips in the day. When we came to the great pond, we &s;taid there one day to re&s;t our&s;elves and to kill ducks and gee&s;e.</P>
<P>While we remained here I went in company with a young Caughnewaga, who was about &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years of age, Chinnohete by name, in order to gather crannberries. As he was gathering berries at &s;ome di&s;tance from me, three Jibe|wa &s;quaws crept up undi&s;covered and made at him &s;peedily, but he nimbly e&s;caped and came to me apparently terrified. I a&s;ked him what he was afraid of? he replied did you not &s;ee tho&s;e &s;quaws? I told him I did, and they appeared to be in a very good humour. I a&s;ked him wherefore then he was afraid of them? He &s;aid the Jibewa &s;quaws were very bad women, and had a very ugly cu&s;tom among them. I a&s;ked him what that cu&s;tom was? he &s;aid that when two or three of them could catch a young lad, that was betwixt a man and a boy, out by him&s;elf, if they could overpower him, they would &s;trip him by force in order to &s;ee whether he was coming on to be a man or not. He &s;aid that was what they intended when they crawled up, and ran &s;o violently at him, but &s;aid he, I am very glad that I &s;o narrowly e&s;caped. I then agreed with Chinnohete in con|demning this as a bad cu&s;tom, and an exceeding immode&s;t action for young women to be guilty of.</P>
<P>From our &s;ugar camp on the head waters of Big Beaver creek, to this place is not hilly, and &s;ome places the woods are tolera|bly clear: but in mo&s;t places exceeding bru&s;hy. The land here is chiefly &s;econd and third rate. The timber on the upland is white-oak, black-oak, hickory and che&s;nut: there is al&s;o in &s;ome places walnut up land, and plenty of good water. The bottoms here are generally large and good.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="036317_0041_1008DC1566DF7638">We again proceeded on from the pond to the forks of Caya|haga, at the rate of about five miles per day.</P>
<P>The land on this route is not very hilly, it is well watered, and, in many places ill timbered, generally bru&s;hy, and chiefly &s;econd and third rate land, intermixed with good bottoms.</P>
<P>When we came to the forks, we found that the &s;kins we had &s;caffolded were all &s;afe. Though this was a public place, and Indians frequently pa&s;&s;ing, and our &s;kins hanging up in view; yet there was none &s;tolen; and it is &s;eldom that Indians do &s;teal any thing from one another; and they &s;ay they never did, until the white people came among them, and learned &s;ome of them, to lie, cheat and &s;teal,&mdash;but be that as it may, they never did cur&s;e or &s;wear, until the whites learned them; &s;ome think their language will not admit of it, but I am not of that opinion, if I was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, I could find language to cur&s;e or &s;wear, in the Indian tongue.</P>
<P>I remember that Tecaughretanego, when &s;omething di&s;plea&s;|ed him, &s;aid, God damn it.&mdash;I a&s;ked him if he knew what he then &s;aid? he &s;aid he did; and mentioned one of their degra|ding expre&s;&s;ions, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be the meaning or &s;ome|thing like the meaning of what he had &s;aid. I told him that it did not bear the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to it; that what he &s;aid, was calling upon the great &s;pirit to puni&s;h the object he was di&s;|plea&s;ed with. He &s;tood for &s;ometime amazed, and then &s;aid, if this be the meaning of the&s;e words what &s;ort of people are the whites? when the traders were among us the&s;e words &s;eemed to be intermixed with all their di&s;cour&s;e. He told me to re|con&s;ider what I had &s;aid, for he thought I mu&s;t be mi&s;taken in my definition; if I was not mi&s;taken, he &s;aid, the traders applied the&s;e words not only wickedly, but often times very fooli&s;hly and contrary to &s;en&s;e or rea&s;on. He &s;aid he remembered once of a trader's accidentally breaking his gun lock, and on that occa&s;ion calling out aloud God damn it&mdash;&s;urely &s;aid he the gun lock was not an object worthy of puni&s;hment for Owaneeyo, or the Great Spirit: he al&s;o ob&s;erved the traders often u&s;ed this expre&s;&s;ion, when they were in a good humour and not di&s;plea&s;ed with any thing.&mdash;I acknowledged that the traders u&s;ed this expre&s;&s;ion very often, in a mo&s;t irrational, incon&s;i&s;tent, and impious man|ner; yet I &s;till a&s;&s;erted that I had given the true meaning of the&s;e words.&mdash;He replied, if &s;o, the traders are as bad as Oona&s;ahroona, or the under ground inhabitants, which is the name they give the devils; as they entertain a notion that their place of re&s;idence is under the earth.</P>
<P>We took up our birch-bark canoes which we had buried, and found that they were not damaged by the winter; but they not being &s;ufficient to carry all that we now had, we made a large
<PB N="43" REF="036317_0042_1008DC1801335F80">
che&s;nut bark canoe; as elm bark was not to be found at this place.</P>
<P>We all embarked, and had a very agreeable pa&s;&s;age down the Cayahaga, and along the &s;outh &s;ide of Lake Erie, until we pa&s;&s;|ed the mouth of Sandu&s;ky; then the wind aro&s;e, and we put in at the mouth of the Miami of the Lake, at Cedar Point, where we remained &s;everal days, and killed a number of Turkeys, gee&s;e, ducks and &s;wans. The wind being fair, and the lake not extremely rough, we again embarked, hoi&s;ted up &s;ails, and arrived &s;afe at the Wiandot town, nearly oppo&s;ite to Fort De|troit, on the north &s;ide of the river. Here we found a number of French traders, every one very willing to deal with us for our beaver.</P>
<P>We bought our&s;elves fine clothes, amunition, paint, tobac|co, &amp;c. and according to promi&s;e, they purcha&s;ed me a new gun: yet we had parted with only about one third of our bea|ver. At length a trader came to town with French Brandy: We purcha&s;ed a keg of it, and held a council about who was to get drunk, and who was to keep &s;ober. I was invited to get drunk, but I refu&s;ed the propo&s;al&mdash;then they told me that I mu&s;t be one of tho&s;e who were to take care of the drunken peo|ple. I did not like this; but of two evils I cho&s;e that which I thought was the lea&s;t&mdash;and fell in with tho&s;e who were to conceal the arms, and keep every dangerous weapon we could, out of their way, and endeavor, if po&s;&s;ible to keep the drinking club from killing each other, which was a very hard ta&s;k. Se|veral times we hazarded our own lives, and got our&s;elves hurt, in preventing them from &s;laying each other. Before they had fini&s;hed this keg, near one third of the town was introduced to this drinking club; they could not pay their part, as they had already di&s;po&s;ed of all their &s;kins; but that made no odds, all were welcome to drink.</P>
<P>When they were done with this keg, they applied to the tra|ders, and procured a kettle full of brandy at a time, which they divided out with a large wooden &s;poon,&mdash;and &s;o they went on and never quit while they had a &s;ingle beaver &s;kin.</P>
<P>When the trader had got all our beaver, he moved off to the Ottawa town, about a mile above the Wiandot town.</P>
<P>When the brandy was gone, and the drinking club &s;ober, they appeared much dejected. Some of them were crippled, o|thers badly wounded, a number of their fine new &s;hirts tore, and &s;everal blankets were burned:&mdash;a number of &s;quaws were al&s;o in this club, and neglected their corn planting.</P>
<P>We could now hear the effects of the brandy in the Ottawa town. They were &s;inging and yelling in the mo&s;t hideous man|ner,
<PB N="44" REF="036317_0043_1008DC19895344A0">
both night and day; but their frolic ended wor&s;e than ours; five Ottawas were killed and a great many wounded.</P>
<P>After this a number of young Indians were getting their ears cut, and they urged me to have mine cut likewi&s;e; but they did not attempt to compel me, though they endeavoured to per|&s;uade me. The principal arguments they u&s;ed were its being a very great ornament, and al&s;o the common fa&s;hion&mdash;The former I did not believe, and the latter I could not deny. The way they performed this operation was by cutting the fle&s;hy part of the circle of the ear clo&s;e to the gri&s;tle quite through. When this was done they wrapt rags round this fle&s;hy part un|til it was entirely healed; then they hung lead to it and &s;tretched it to a wonderful length: when it was &s;ufficiently &s;tretched, they wrapt the fle&s;hy part round with bra&s;s wire, which formed it into a &s;emicircle about four inches diameter.</P>
<P>Many of the young men were now exerci&s;ing them&s;elves in a game re&s;embling foot ball; though they commonly &s;truck the ball with a crooked &s;tick, made for that purpo&s;e; al&s;o a game &s;omething like this, wherein they u&s;ed a wooden ball, about three inches diameter, and the in&s;trument they moved it with was a &s;trong &s;taff about five feet long, with a hoop net on the end of it, large enough to contain the ball. Before they begin the play, they lay off about half a mile di&s;tance in a clear plain, and the oppo&s;ite parties all attend at the centre, where a di&s;in|tere&s;ted per&s;on ca&s;ts up the ball then the opo&s;ite parties all con|tend for it. If any one gets it into his net, he runs with it the way he wi&s;hes it to go, and they all pur&s;ue him. If one of the oppo&s;ite party overtakes the per&s;on with the ball, he gives the &s;taff a &s;troke which cau&s;es the ball to fly out of the net; then they have another debate for it; and if the one that gets it can outrun all the opo&s;ite party, and can carry it quite out, or over the line at the end, the game is won; but this &s;eldom happens. When any one is running away with the ball, and is like to be overtaken, he commonly throws it, and with this in|&s;trument can ca&s;t it fifty or &s;ixty yards. Sometimes when the ball is almo&s;t at the one end, matters will take a &s;udden turn, and the oppo&s;ite party may quickly carry it out at the other end. Often times they will work a long while back and for|ward before they can get the ball over the line, or win the game.</P>
<P>About the fir&s;t of June 1757 the warriors were preparing to go to war, in the Wiandot, Pottowatomy, and Ottawa towns; al&s;o a great many Jibewas came down from the upper lakes; and after &s;inging their war &s;ongs and going through their common ceremonies, they marched off again&s;t the frontiers of Virginia, Maryland and Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="036317_0044_1008DC1CABEAC470">land, and Penn&s;ylvania, in their u&s;ual manner, &s;inging the tra|velling &s;ong, &s;low firing, &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the north&s;ide of the river St. Laurence, oppo&s;ite to Fort Detroit, there is an i&s;land, which the Indians call the Long I|&s;land, and which they &s;ay is above one thou&s;and miles long, and in &s;ome places above one hundred miles broad. They further &s;ay that the great river that comes down by Cane&s;atauga and that empties into the main branch of St. Laurence, above Montreal, originates from one &s;ource, with the St. Lawrence, and forms this i&s;land.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to Detroit, and below it, was originally a prairie, and laid off in lots about &s;ixty rods broad, and a great length: each lot is divided into two fields, which they cultivate year about. The principal grain that the French rai&s;ed in the&s;e fields was &s;pring wheat, and peas.</P>
<P>They built all their hou&s;es on the front of the&s;e lots on the river &s;ide; and as the banks of the river are very low, &s;ome of the hou&s;es are not above three or four feet above the &s;urface of the water; yet they are in no danger of being di&s;turbed by fre&s;hes, as the river &s;eldom ri&s;es above eighteen inches; be|cau&s;e it is the communication, of the river St. Laurence, from one lake to another.</P>
<P>As dwelling-hou&s;es, barns, and &s;tables are all built on the front of the&s;e lots; at a di&s;tance it appears like a continued row of hou&s;es in a town, on each &s;ide of the river for a long way. The&s;e villages, the town, the river and the plains, being all in view at once, affords a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The inhabitants here chiefly drink the river water; and as it comes from the northward it is very whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>The land here is principally &s;econd rate, and comparatively &s;peaking, a &s;mall part is fir&s;t or third rate; tho about four or five miles &s;outh of Detroit, their is a &s;mall portion that is wor&s;e than what I would call third rate, which produces abundance of hurtle berries.</P>
<P>There is plenty of good meadow ground here, and a great ma|ny mar&s;hes that are over&s;pread with water.&mdash;The timber is elm, &s;ugar-tree, black-a&s;h, white-a&s;h, abundance of water-a&s;h, oak, hickory, and &s;ome walnut.</P>
<P>About the middle of June the Indians were almo&s;t all gone to war, from &s;ixteen to &s;ixty; yet Tecaughretanego remained in town with me. Tho he had formerly, when they were at war with the &s;outhern nations been a great warrior, and an emi|nent coun&s;ellor; and I think as clear and as able a rea&s;oner upon any &s;ubject that he had an opportunity of being acquaint|ed with, as I ever knew; yet he had all along been again&s;t
<PB N="46" REF="036317_0045_1008DC1ECE010D70">
this war, and had &s;treneou&s;ly oppo&s;ed it in council. He &s;aid if the Engli&s;h and French had a quarrel let them fight their own battles them&s;elves; it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s to intermeddle there|with.</P>
<P>Before the warriors returned we were very &s;carce of pro|vi&s;ion: and tho we did not commonly &s;teal from one another; yet we &s;tole during this time any thing that we could eat from the French, under the notion that it was ju&s;t for us to do &s;o; becau&s;e they &s;upported their &s;oldiers; and our &s;quaws, old men and children were &s;uffering on the account of the war, as our hunters were all gone.</P>
<P>Some time in Augu&s;t the warriors returned, and brought in with them a great many &s;calps, pri&s;oners, hor&s;es and plunder; and the common report among the young warriors, was, that they would intirely &s;ubdue Tulha&s;aga, that is the Engli&s;h, or it might be literally rendered the Morning Light inhabitants.</P>
<P>About the fir&s;t of November a number of families were pre|paring to go on their winter hunt, and all agreed to cro&s;s the lake together. We encamped at the mouth of the river the fir&s;t night, and a council was held, whether we would cro&s;s thro' by the three i&s;lands, or coa&s;t i round the lake. The&s;e i&s;lands lie in a line acro&s;s the lake, and are ju&s;t in &s;ight of each other. Some of the Wiandots or Ottawas frequently make their winter hunt on the&s;e i&s;land. Tho excepting wild fowl and fi&s;h, there is &s;carcely any game here but racoons which are amazingly plenty, and exceeding large and fat; as they feed upon the wild rice, which grows in abundance in wet places round the&s;e i|&s;lands. It is &s;aid that each hunter in one winter will catch one thou&s;and racoons.</P>
<P>It is a received opinion among the Indians that the &s;nakes and racoons are tran&s;mutable; and that a great many of the &s;nakes turn racoons every fall, and racoons &s;nakes every &s;pring. This notion is founded on ob&s;ervations made on the &s;nakes and racoons in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>As the racoons here lodge in rocks, the trappers make their wooden traps at the mouth of the holes; and as they go daily to look at their traps, in the winter &s;ea&s;on, they commonly find them filled with racoons; but in the &s;pring or when the fro&s;t is out of the ground, they &s;ay, they then find their traps filled with large rattle &s;nakes. And therefore conclude that the racoons are transformed. They al&s;o &s;ay that the rea&s;on why they are &s;o remarkably plenty in the winter, is, every fall the &s;nakes turn racoons again.</P>
<P>I told them that tho I had never landed on any of the&s;e i&s;lands, yet from the unanimous accounts I had received, I believed that both &s;nakes and racoons were plenty there; but no doubt

they all remained there both &s;ummer and winter, only the &s;nakes were not to be &s;een in the latter; yet I did not believe that they were tran&s;mutable.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands are but &s;eldom vi&s;ited; becau&s;e early in the &s;pring and late in the fall it is dangerous &s;ailing in their bark canoes; and in the &s;ummer they are &s;o infe&s;ted with various kinds of &s;erpents, (but chiefly rattle &s;nakes,) that it is dange|rous landing.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now quit this digre&s;&s;ion, and return to the re&s;ult of the council at the mouth of the river. We concluded to coa&s;t it round the lake, and in two days we came to the mouth of the Miami of the Lake, and landed on cedar point, where we re|mained &s;everal days. Here we held a council, and concluded we would take a driving hunt in concert, and in partner&s;hip&punc;</P>
<P>The river in this place is about a mile broad, and as it and the lake forms a kind of neck, which terminates in a point, all the hunters (which were fifty-three) went up the river, and we &s;cattered our&s;elves from the river to the lake. When we fir&s;t began to move we were not in &s;ight of each other, but as we all rai&s;ed the yell, we could move regularly together by the noi&s;e. At length we came in &s;ight of each other and appeared to be marching in good order; before we came to the point, both the &s;quaws and boys in the canoes were &s;cattered up the river, and along the lake, to prevent the deer from making their e&s;cape by water. As we advanced near the point the guns began to crack &s;lowly; and after &s;ome time the firing was like a little engagement. The &s;quaws and boys were bu&s;y toma|hawking the deer in the water, and we &s;hooting them down on the land:&mdash;We killed in all about thirty deer: tho a great ma|ny made their e&s;cape by water.</P>
<P>We had now great fea&s;ting and rejoicing, as we had plenty of homony, veni&s;on, and wild fowl. The gee&s;e at this time ap|peared to be preparing to move &s;outhward&mdash;It might be a&s;ked what is meant by the gee&s;e preparing to move? The Indians repre&s;ent them as holding a great council at this time concern|ing the weather in order to conclude upon a day, that they may all at or near one time leave the Northern Lakes, and wing their way to the &s;outhern bays. When matters are brought to a con|clu&s;ion and the time appointed that they are to take wing, then they &s;ay, a great number of expre&s;&s;es are &s;ent off, in order to let the different tribes know the re&s;ult of this council, that they may be all in readine&s;s to move at the time appointed. As there is a great commotion among the gee&s;e at this time, it would appear by their actions, that &s;uch a council had been held. Certain it is, that they are led by in&s;tict to act in concert and to move off regularly after their leaders.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="036317_0047_1008DC277AAFCDC0">Here our company &s;eparated. The chief part of them went up the Miami river, that empties into Lake Erie, at cedar point, whil&s;t we proceeded on our journey in company with Tecaugh|retanego, Tontileaugo, and two families of the Wiandots.</P>
<P>As cold weather was now approaching, we began to feel the doleful effects of extravagantly and fooli&s;hly &s;pending the large quantity of beaver we had taken in our la&s;t winters hunt. We were all nearly in the &s;ame circum&s;tances&mdash;&s;carcely one had a &s;hirt to his back; but each of us had an old blanket which we belted round us in the day, and &s;lept in at night, with a deer or bear &s;kin under us for our bed.</P>
<P>When we came to to the falls of Sandu&s;ky, we buried our birch bark canoes as u&s;ual, at a large burying place for that purpo&s;e, a little below the falls. At this place the river falls about eight feet over a rock, but not perpendicular. With much difficulty we pu&s;hed up our wooden canoes, &s;ome of us went up the river, and the re&s;t by land with the hor&s;es, until we came to the great meadows or prairies that lie between Sandu&s;ky and Sciota.</P>
<P>When we came to this place we met with &s;ome Ottawa hun|ters, and agreed with them to take, what they call a ring hunt, in partner&s;hip. We waited until we expected rain was near falling to extingui&s;h the fire, and then we kindled a large circle in the prairie. At this time, or before the bucks began to run a great number of deer lay concealed in the gra&s;s, in the day, and moved about in the night; but as the fire burned in to|wards the centre of the circle, the deer fled before the fire: the Indians were &s;cattered al&s;o at &s;ome di&s;tance before the fire, and &s;hot them down every opportunity, which was very frequent, e&s;|pecially as the circle became &s;mall. When we came to divide the deer, there were above ten to each hunter, which were all killed in a few hours. The rain did not come on that night to put out the out-&s;ide circle of the fire, and as the wind aro&s;e, it extended thro the whole prairie which was about fifty miles in length, and in &s;ome places near twenty in breadth. This put an end to our ring hunting this &s;ea&s;on, and was in other re&s;pects an injury to us in the hunting bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that upon the whole we received more harm that benefit by our rapid hunting frolic. We then moved from the north end of the glades, and excamp|ed at the carrying place.</P>
<P>This place is in the plains betwixt a creek that empties into Sandu&s;ky, and one that runs into Sciota: and at the time of high water, or in the &s;pring &s;ea&s;on, there is but about one half mile of portage, and that very level, and clear of rocks, timber or &s;tones; &s;o that with a little digging there may be water car|riage the whole way from Sciota to Lake Erie.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="036317_0048_1008DC2A09D44BE0">From the mouth of Sandu&s;ky to the falls is chiefly fir&s;t rate land, lying flat or level, intermixed with large bodies of clear meadows, where the gra&s;s is exceeding rank, and in many places three or four feet high. The timber is oak, hickory, walnut, cherry black-a&s;h, elm, &s;ugar-tree, buckeye, locu&s;t and beech. In &s;ome places there is wet timber land&mdash;the timber in the&s;e places is chiefly water-a&s;h, &s;ycamore, or button-wood.</P>
<P>From the falls to the prairies, the land lies well to the &s;un, it is neither too flat nor too hilly&mdash;and chiefly fir&s;t rate. The timber nearly the &s;ame as below the falls, excepting the water-a&s;h.&mdash;There is al&s;o here, &s;ome plats of beech land, that appears to be &s;econd rate, as it frequently produces &s;pice-wood. The prairie appears to be a tolerable fertile &s;oil, tho in many places too wet for cultivation; yet I apprehend it would produce tim|ber, were it only kept from fire.</P>
<P>The Indians are of the opinion that the &s;quirrels plant all the timber; as they bury a number of nuts for food, and only one at a place. When a &s;quirrel is killed the various kinds of nuts thus buried will grow.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved that when the&s;e prairies have only e&s;caped fire for one year, near where a &s;ingle tree &s;tood, there was a young growth of timber &s;uppo&s;ed to be planted by the &s;quir|rels; but when the prairies were again burned, all this young growth was immediately con&s;umed; as the fire rages in the gra&s;s, to &s;uch a pitch, that numbers of racoons are thereby burned to death.</P>
<P>On the we&s;t &s;ide of the prairie, or betwixt that and Sciota, there is a large body of fir&s;t rate land&mdash;the timber, walnut, lo|cu&s;t, &s;ugar-tree, buckeye, cherry, a&s;h, elm, mulberry, plumb-trees, &s;picewood, black-haw red-haw, oak and hickory.</P>
<P>About the time the bucks quit running, Tontileaugo his wife and children, Tecaughretanego, his &s;on Nungany and my&s;elf left the Wiandot camps at the carrying place, and cro&s;&s;ed the Sciota river at the &s;outh end of the glades, and proceeded on about a &s;outh-we&s;t cour&s;e to a large creek called Ollen|tangy, which I believe interlocks with the waters of the Miami, and empties into Sciota on the we&s;t &s;ide thereof, From the &s;outh end of the prairie to Ollentangy, there is a large quantity of beech land, intermixed with fir&s;t rate land. Here we made our winter hut, and had con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s in hunting.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time one of Tontileaugo's &s;tep-&s;ons, (a lad about eight years of age) offended him, and he gave the boy a mode|rate whipping, which much di&s;plea&s;ed his Wiandot wife. She acknowledged that the boy was guilty of a fault, but thought that he ought to have been ducked, which is their u&s;ual mode of cha&s;ti&s;ement. She &s;aid &s;he could not bear to have her &s;on
<PB N="50" REF="036317_0049_1008DC2CCBB3E150">
whipped like a &s;ervant or &s;lave&mdash;and &s;he was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed that when Tontileaugo went out to hunt, &s;he got her two hor&s;es, and all her effects, (as in this country the hu&s;band and wife have &s;eparate intere&s;ts) and moved back to the Wiandot camps that we had left.</P>
<P>When Tontileaugo returned, he was much di&s;turbed on hear|ing of his wife's elopement, and &s;aid that he would never go after her were it not that he was afraid that &s;he would get bewildered, and that his children that &s;he had ta|ken with her, might &s;uffer. Tontileaugo went after his wife, and when they met they made up the quarrel, and he never re|turned; but left Tecaughretanego and his &s;on, (a boy about ten years of age) and my&s;elf, who remained here in our hut all winter.</P>
<P>Tecaughretanego who had been a fir&s;t-rate warior, &s;tate&s;man and hunter; and though he was now near &s;ixty years of age, he was yet equal to the common run of hunters, but &s;ubject to the rheumati&s;m, which deprived him of the u&s;e of his legs.</P>
<P>Shortly after Tontileaugo left us, Tecaughretanego became lame, and could &s;carcely walk out of our hut for two months. I had con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s in hunting and trapping. Though Tecaughretanego endured much pain and mi&s;ery, yet he bore it all with wonderful patience, and would often endeavor to entertain me with chearful conver&s;ation. Sometimes he would applaud me for my diligence, &s;kill and activity&mdash;and at other times he would take great care in giving me in&s;tructions concer|ning the hunting and trapping bu&s;ine&s;s. He would al&s;o tell me that if I failed of &s;ucce&s;s, we would &s;uffer very much, as we were about forty miles from any one living, that we knew of; yet he would not intimate that he apprehended we were in any danger, but &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed that I was fully adequate to the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>"Tontileaugo left us a little before Chri&s;tmas, and from that until &s;ome time in February, we had always plenty of bear meat, veni&s;on, &amp;c. During this time I killed much more than we could u&s;e, but having no hor&s;es to carry in what I killed, I left part of it in the woods. In February there came a &s;now, with a cru&s;t, which made a great noi&s;e when walking on it, and frightened away the deer; and as bear and beaver were &s;carce here, we got entirely out of provi&s;ion. After I had hunted two days without eating any thing, and had very &s;hort allowance for &s;ome days before, I returned late in the evening faint and weary. When I came into our hut, Tecaughretanego a&s;ked what &s;ucce&s;s? I told him not any. He a&s;ked me if I was not very hungry? I replied that the keen appetite &s;eemed to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure removed, but I was both faint and weary. He commanded Nunganey his little &s;on, to bring me &s;omething to
<PB N="51" REF="036317_0050_1008DC3104CE58C0">
eat, and he brought me a kettle with &s;ome bones and broth,&mdash; after eating a few mouthfuls my appetite violently returned, and I thought the victuals had a mo&s;t agreable reli&s;h, though it was only fox and wild-cat bones, which lay about the camp, which the ravens and turkey-buzzards had picked&mdash;the&s;e Nun|ganey had collected and boiled, until the &s;inews that remained on the bones would &s;trip off. I &s;peedily fini&s;hed my allowance, &s;uch as it was, and when I had ended my <HI>sweet</HI> repa&s;t, Tecaugh|retanego a&s;ked me how I felt? I told him that I was much re|fre&s;hed. He then handed me his pipe and pouch, and told me to take a &s;moke. I did &s;o. He then &s;aid he had &s;omething of importance to tell me, if I was now compo&s;ed and ready to hear it. I told him that I was ready to hear him. He &s;aid the rea&s;on why he deferred his &s;peech till now, was becau&s;e few men are in a right humor to hear good talk, when they are ex|tremely hungry, as they are then generally fretful and di&s;com|po&s;ed; but as you appear now to enjoy calmne&s;s and &s;erenity of mind, I will now communicate to you the thoughts of my heart, and tho&s;e things that I know to be true.</P>
<P><HI>"Brother,</HI></P>
<P>"As you have lived with the white people, you have not had the &s;ame advantage of knowing that the great being above feeds his people, and gives them their meat in due &s;ea&s;on, as we In|dians have, who are frequently out of provi&s;ions, and yet are wonderfully &s;upplied, and that &s;o frequently that it is evident|ly the hand of the great Owaneeyo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the name of God, in their tongue, and &s;ignifies the owner and ru|ler of all things.</NOTE> that doth this: whereas the white people have commonly large &s;tocks of tame cattle, that they can kill when they plea&s;e, and al&s;o their barns and cribs filled with grain, and therefore have not the &s;ame oppor|tunity of &s;eeing and knowing that they are &s;upported by the ruler of Heaven and Earth.</P>
<P><HI>"Brother,</HI></P>
<P>"I know that you are now afraid that we will all peri&s;h with hunger, but you have no ju&s;t rea&s;on to fear this.</P>
<P><HI>"Brother,</HI></P>
<P>"I have been young, but am now old&mdash;I have been frequent|ly under the like circum&s;tance that we now are, and that &s;ome time or other in almo&s;t every year of my life; yet, I have hi|therto been &s;upported, and my wants &s;upplied in time of need.</P>
<P><HI>"Brother,</HI></P>
<P>"Owaneeyo &s;ome times &s;uffers us to be in want, in order to teach us our dependance upon him, and to let us know that we are to love and &s;erve him: and likewi&s;e to know the worth of the favors that we receive, and to make us more thankful.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="036317_0051_1008DC32A5B8AD60"><HI>"Brother,</HI></P>
<P>"Be a&s;&s;ured that you will be &s;upplied with food, and that ju&s;t in the right time; but you mu&s;t continue diligent in the u&s;e of means&mdash;go to &s;leep, and ri&s;e early in the morning and go a hunting&mdash;be &s;trong and exert your&s;elf like a man, and the great &s;pirit will direct your way."</P>
<P>The next morning I went out, and &s;teered about an ea&s;t cour&s;e. I proceeded on &s;lowly for about five miles, and &s;aw deer frequently, but as the cru&s;t on the &s;now made a great noi&s;e, they were always running before I &s;pied them, &s;o that I could not get a &s;hoot. A violent appetite returned, and I be|came intolerably hungry;&mdash;it was now that I concluded I would run off to Penn&s;ylvania, my native country. As the &s;now was on the ground, and Indian hunters almo&s;t the whole of the way before me, I had but a poor pro&s;pect of making my e&s;cape&punc; but my ca&s;e appeared de&s;perate. If I &s;taid here I thought I would peri&s;h with hunger, and if I met with Indians, they could but kill me.</P>
<P>I then proceeded on as fa&s;t as I could walk, and when I got about ten or twelve miles from our hut, I came upon fre&s;h buf|faloe tracks,&mdash;I pur&s;ued after, and in a &s;hort time came in &s;ight of them, as they were pa&s;&s;ing through a &s;mall glade&mdash;I ran with all my might, and headed them, where I lay in am|bu&s;h, and killed a very large cow. I immediately kindled a fire and began to roa&s;t meat, but could not wait till it was done&mdash;I ate it almo&s;t raw. When hunger was abated I began to be tenderly concerned for my old Indian brother, and the little boy I had left in a peri&s;hing condition. I made ha&s;te and packed up what meat I could carry, &s;ecured what I left from the wolves, and returned homewards.</P>
<P>I &s;carcely thought on the old man's &s;peech while I was al|mo&s;t di&s;tracted with hunger, but on my return was much affect|ed with it, reflected on my&s;elf for my hard-heartedne&s;s and ingra|titude, in attempting to run off and leave the venerable old man and little boy to peri&s;h with hunger. I al&s;o con&s;idered how re|markably the old man's &s;peech had been verified in our provi|dentially obtaining a &s;upply. I thought al&s;o of that part of his &s;peech which treated of the fractious di&s;po&s;itions of hungry people, which was the only excu&s;e I had for my ba&s;e inhuma|nity, in attempting to leave them in the mo&s;t deplorable &s;itua|tion.</P>
<P>As it was moon-light, I got home to our hut, and found the old man in his u&s;ual good humor. He thanked me for my ex|exertion, and bid me &s;it down, as I mu&s;t certainly be fatigued, and he commanded Nunganey to make ha&s;te and cook. I told him I would cook for him, and let the boy lay &s;ome meat on the
<PB N="53" REF="036317_0052_1008DC344A740E50">
coals, for him&s;elf&mdash;which he did, but ate it almo&s;t raw, as I had done. I immediately hung on the kettle with &s;ome water, and cut the beef in thin &s;lices, and put them in:&mdash;when it had boil|ed awhile, I propo&s;ed taking it off the fire, but the old man re|plied, "let it be done enough." This he &s;aid in as patient and unconcerned a manner, as if he had not wanted one &s;ingle meal. He commanded Nunganey to eat no more beef at that time, lea&s;t he might hurt him&s;elf; but told him to &s;it down, and after &s;ome time he might &s;up &s;ome broth&mdash;this command he reluct|antly obeyed.</P>
<P>When we were all refre&s;hed, Tecauretanego delivered a &s;peech upon the nece&s;&s;ity and plea&s;ure of receiving the nece&s;&s;a|ry &s;upports of life with thankfulne&s;s, knowing that Owaneeyo is the great giver. Such &s;peeches from an Indian, may be tho't by tho&s;e who are unacquainted with them, altogether incredi|ble; but when we reflect on the Indian war, we may readily conclude that they are not an ignorant or &s;tupid &s;ort of people, or they would not have been &s;uch fatal enemies. When they came into our country they outwitted us&mdash;and when we &s;ent ar|mies into their country, they outgeneralled, and beat us with in|ferior force. Let us al&s;o take into con&s;ideration that Tecaugh|retanego was no common per&s;on, but was among the Indians, as Socrates in the ancient Heathen world; and it may be, equal to him&mdash;if not in wi&s;dom and learning, yet, perhaps in patience and fortitude. Notwith&s;tanding Tecauretanego's, uncommon natural abilitis, yet in the &s;equel of this hi&s;tory you will &s;ee the deficiency of the light of nature, unaided by revelation, in this truly great man.</P>
<P>The next morning Tecaughretanego de&s;ired me to go back and bring another load of buffaloe beef: As I proceeded to do &s;o, about five miles from our hut I found a bear tree. As a &s;ap|ling, grew near the tree, and reached near the hole that the bear went in at, I got dry dozed or rotton wood, that would catch and hold fire almo&s;t as well as &s;punk. This wood I tied up in bunches, fixed them on my back, and then climbed up the &s;apling, and with a pole, I put them touched with fire, into the hole, and then came down and took my gun in my hand. Af|ter &s;ome time the bear came out, and I killed and &s;kinned it. packed up a load of the meat, (after &s;ecuring the remainder from the wolves) and returned home before night. On my re|turn my old brother and his &s;on were much rejoiced at my &s;uc|ce&s;s. After this we had plenty of provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>We remained here until &s;ome time in April 1758. At this time Tecaughretanego had recovered &s;o, that he could walk about. We made a bark canoe, embarked, and went down Ol|lentangy
<PB N="54" REF="036317_0053_1008DC3774B1BF00">
&s;ome di&s;tance, but the water being low, we were in dan|ger of &s;plitting our canoe upon the rocks: therefore Tecaughre|tanego concluded we would encamp on &s;hore, and pray for rain.</P>
<P>When we encamped, Tecaughretanego made him&s;elf a &s;weat-hou&s;e; which he did by &s;ticking a number of hoops in the ground, each hoop forming a &s;emi-circle&mdash;this he covered all round with blankets and &s;kins; he then prepared hot &s;tones, which he rolled into this hut, and then went into it him&s;elf, with a little kettle of water in his hand, mixed with a variety of herbs, which he had formerly cured, and had now with him in his pack&mdash;they afforded an odoriferous perfume. When he was in, he told me to pull down the blankets behind him, and cover all up clo&s;e, which I did, and then he began to pour water upon the hot &s;tones, and to &s;ing aloud. He continued in this vehement hot place about fifteen minutes:&mdash;all this he did in order to purify him&s;elf before he would addre&s;s the Supreme Being. When he came out of his &s;weat-hou&s;e, he began to burn tobacco and pray. He began each pretition with <HI>oh, ho, ho, ho,</HI> which is a kind of a&s;piration, and &s;ignifies an ardent wi&s;h. I ob&s;erved that all his petitions were only for immedi|ate, or pre&s;ent temporal ble&s;&s;ings. He began his addre&s;s by thank&s;giving, in the following manner:</P>
<P>"O great being! I thank thee that I have obtained the u&s;e of my legs again&mdash;that I am now able to walk about and kill tur|keys, &amp;c. without feeling exqui&s;ite pain and mi&s;ery: I know that thou art a hearer and a helper, and therefore I will call upon thee.</P>
<P><HI>"Oh, ho, ho, ho,</HI></P>
<P>"Grant that my knees and ankles may be right well, and that I may be able, not only to walk, but to run, and to jump logs, as I did la&s;t fall.</P>
<P><HI>"Oh, ho, ho, ho,</HI></P>
<P>"Grant that on this voyage we may frequently kill bears, as they may be cro&s;&s;ing the Sciota and Sandu&s;ky.</P>
<P><HI>"Oh, ho, ho, ho,</HI></P>
<P>"Grant that we may kill plenty of Turkeys along the banks, to &s;tew with our fat bear meat.</P>
<P><HI>"Oh, ho, ho, ho,</HI></P>
<P>"Giant that rain may come to rai&s;e the Ollentangy about two or three feet, that we may cro&s;s in &s;afety down to Sciota, without danger of our canoe being wrecked on the rocks:&mdash;and now, O great being! thou knowe&s;t how matters &s;tand&mdash;thou knowe&s;t that I am a great lover of tobacco, and though I know not when I may get any more, I now make a pre&s;ent of the la&s;t I have unto thee, as a free burnt offering; therefore I expect thou wilt hear and grant the&s;e reque&s;ts, and I thy &s;ervant will return thee thanks, and love thee for thy gifts."</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="036317_0054_1008DC3A332615F0">During the whole of this &s;cene I &s;at by Tecaughretanego, and as he went through it with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity, I was &s;e|riou&s;ly affected with his prayers. I remained duly compo&s;ed until he came to the burning of the tobacco, and as I knew that he was a great lover of it, and &s;aw him ca&s;t the la&s;t of it into the fire, it excited in me a kind of meriment, and I in&s;en&s;ibly &s;miled. Tecaughretanego ob&s;erved me laughing, which di&s;|plea&s;ed him, and occa&s;ioned him to addre&s;s me in the following manner.</P>
<P><HI>"Brother,</HI></P>
<P>"I have &s;omewhat to &s;ay to you, and I hope you will not be offended when I tell you of your faults. You know that when you were reading your books in town, I would not let the boys or any one di&s;turb you; but now when I was praying, I &s;aw you laughing. I do not think that you look upon praying as a fooli&s;h thing;&mdash;I believe you pray your&s;elf. But perhaps you may think my mode, or manner of prayer fooli&s;h; if &s;o, you ought in a friendly manner to in&s;truct me, and not make &s;port of &s;acred things."</P>
<P>I acknowledged my error, and on this he handed me his pipe to &s;moke, in token of friend&s;hip and reconciliation; though at that time he had nothing to &s;moke, but red-willow bark. I told him &s;omething of the method of reconciliation with an of|fended God, as revealed in my Bible, which I had then in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. He &s;aid that he liked my &s;tory better than that of the French prie&s;ts, but he thought that he was now too old to be|gin to learn a new religion, therefore he &s;hould continue to wor&s;hip God in the way that he had been taught, and that if &s;alvation or future happine&s;s was to be had in his way of wor|&s;hip, he expected he would obtain it, and if it was incon&s;i&s;tent with the honor of the great &s;pirit to accept of him in his own way of wor&s;hip, he hoped that Owaneeyo would accept of him in the way I had mentioned, or in &s;ome other way, though he might now be ignorant of the channel through which favor or mercy might be conveyed. He &s;aid that he believed that O|waneeyo would hear and help every one that &s;incerely waited upon him.</P>
<P>Here we may &s;ee how far the light of nature could go; per|haps we &s;ee it here almo&s;t in its highe&s;t extent. Notwith|&s;tanding the ju&s;t views that this great man entertained of Pro|vidence, yet we now &s;ee him (though he acknowledged his guilt) expecting to appea&s;e the Deity, and procure his favor, by burning a little tobacco. We may ob&s;erve that all Heathen nations, as far as we can find out either by tradition or the light of Nature, agree with Revelation in this, that &s;acrifice is nece&s;&s;ary, or that &s;ome kind of attonement is to be made,
<PB N="56" REF="036317_0055_1008DC3E938D0CF8">
in order to remove guilt, and reconcile them to God. This, accompanied with numberle&s;s other witne&s;&s;es, is &s;ufficient evi|dence of the rationality the truth of the Scriptures.</P>
<P>A few days after Tecaughretanego had gone through his ce|remonies, and fini&s;hed his prayers, the rain came and rai&s;ed the creek a &s;ufficient height, &s;o that we pa&s;&s;ed in &s;afety down to Sciota, and proceeded up to the carrying place. Let us now de&s;cribe the land on this route, from our winter hut, and down Ollentangy to the Sciota, and up it to the carrying place.</P>
<P>About our winter cabbin is chiefly fir&s;t and &s;econd rate land. A con&s;iderable way up Ollentangy on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide there|of, or betwixt it and the Miami, there is a very large prairie, and from this prairie down Ollentangy to Sciota, is generally fir&s;t rate land. The timber is walnut, &s;ugar-tree, a&s;h, buckeye locu&s;t, wild-cherry and &s;pice-wood, intermixed with &s;ome oak and beech. From the mouth of Ollentangy on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Sciota, up to the carrying place, there is a large body of fir&s;t and &s;econd rate land, and tolerably well watered. The timber is a&s;h, &s;ugar-tree, walnut locu&s;t, oak and beech. Up near the carrying place, the land is a little hilly, but the &s;oil good.</P>
<P>We proceeded from this place down Sandu&s;ky, and in our pa&s;&s;age we killed four bears, and a number of turkeys. Te|caughretanego appeared now fully pur&s;uaded that all this came in an&s;wer to his prayers&mdash;and who can &s;ay with any degree of certainty that it was not &s;o?</P>
<P>When we came to the little lake at the mouth of Sandu&s;ky we called at a Wiandot town that was then there, called Sunyendeand. Here we diverted our&s;elves &s;everal days, by catching rock-fi&s;h in a &s;mall creek, the name of which is al&s;o Sunyendeand, which &s;ignifies Rock-Fi&s;h. They fi&s;hed in the night, with lights, and &s;truck the fi&s;h with giggs or &s;pears. The rock-fi&s;h here, when they begin fir&s;t to run up the creek to &s;pawn, are exceeding fat, and &s;ufficient to fry them&s;elves. The fir&s;t night we &s;carcely caught fi&s;h enough for pre&s;ent u&s;e, for all that was in the town.</P>
<P>The next morning I met with a pri&s;oner at this place, by the name of Thomp&s;on, who had been taken from Virginia: he told me if the Indians would only omit di&s;turbing the fi&s;h for one night, he could catch more fi&s;h than the whole town could make u&s;e of. I told Mr. Thomp&s;on that if he was cer|tain he could do this, that I would u&s;e my influence with the Indians, to let the fi&s;h alone for one night. I applied to the chiefs, who agreed to my propo&s;al, and &s;aid they were anxious to &s;ee what the Great Knife (as they called the Virginian) could do. Mr. Thomp&s;on, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome other
<PB N="57" REF="036317_0056_1008DC4234E82C98">
pri&s;oners, &s;et to work, and made a hoop net of Elm bark: they then cut down a tree acro&s;s the creek, and &s;tuck in &s;takes at the lower &s;ide of it, to prevent the fi&s;h from pa&s;&s;ing up, leaving only a gap at the one &s;ide of the creek:&mdash;here he &s;at with his net, and when he felt the fi&s;h touch the net he drew it up, and frequently would hawl out two or three rock-fi&s;h that would weigh about five or &s;ix pounds each. He continued at this un|til he had hawled out about a waggon load, and then left the gap open, in order to let them pa&s;s up, for they could not go far, on account of the &s;hallow water. Before day Mr. Thomp|&s;on &s;hut it up, to prevent them from pa&s;&s;ing down, in order to let the Indians have &s;ome diver&s;ion in killing them in daylight.</P>
<P>When the news of the fi&s;h came to town, the Indians all collected, and with &s;urprize beheld the large heap of fi&s;h, and applauded the ingenuity of the Virginian. When they &s;aw the number of them that were confined in the water above the tree, the young Indians ran back to the town, and in a &s;hort time returned with their &s;pears, giggs, bows and arrows, &amp;c. and were the chief of that day engaged in killing rock-fi&s;h, in&s;omuch that we had more than we could u&s;e or pre&s;erve. As we had no &s;alt, or any way to keep them, they lay upon the banks, and after &s;ome time great numbers of turkey-buzzards and eagles collected together and devoured them.</P>
<P>Shortly after this we left Sunyendeand, and in three days ar|rived at Detroit, where we remained this &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Some time in May we heard that General Forbes, with &s;even thou&s;and men was preparing to carry on a campaign again&s;t Fort DuQue&s;ne, which then &s;tood near where Fort Pitt was af|terwards erected. Upon receiving this news a number of run|ners were &s;ent off by the French commander at Detroit, to urge the different tribes of Indian warriors to repair to Fort DuQue&s;ne.</P>
<P>Some time in July 1758, the Ottowas, Jibewas, Potowatomies and Wiandots rendzvouzed at Detroit, and marched off to Fort DuQue&s;ne, to prepare for the encounter of General Forbes. The common report was, that they would &s;erve him as they did General Braddock, and obtain much plunder. From this time, until fall, we had frequent accounts of Forbes's army, by Indian runners that were &s;ent out to watch their motion. They &s;pied them frequently from the mountains ever after they left Fort Loudon. Notwith&s;tanding their vigilence, colonel Grant with his Highlanders &s;tole a march upon them, and in the night took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hill about eighty rod from Fort DuQue&s;ne:&mdash;this hill is on that account called Grant's hill to this day. The French and Indians knew not that Grant and his men were there until they beat the drum and played upon
<PB N="58" REF="036317_0057_1008DC43DCF1D210">
the bagpipes, ju&s;t at day-light. They then flew to arms, and the Indians ran up under covert of the banks of Allegheny and Monoagahela, for &s;ome di&s;tance, and then &s;allied out from the banks of the rivers, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hill above Grant; and as he was on the point of it in &s;ight of the fort, they imme|diately &s;urrounded him, and as he had his Highlanders in ranks, and very clo&s;e order, and the Indians &s;cattered, and concealed behind trees, they defeated him with the lo&s;s only of a few war|riors:&mdash;mo&s;t of the Highlanders were killed or taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>After this defeat the Indians held a council, but were divided in their opinions. Some &s;aid that general Forbes would now turn back, and go home the way that he came, as Dunbar had done when General Braddock was defeated: others &s;uppo&s;ed he would come on. The French urged the Indians to &s;tay and &s;ee the event:&mdash;but as it was hard for the Indians to be ab&s;ent from their &s;quaws and children, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, a great many of them returned home to their hunting. After this, the remainder of the Indians, &s;ome French regulars, and a number of Canadians, marched off in que&s;t of General Forbes. They met his army near Fort Ligoneer, and attacked them, but were fru&s;trated in their de&s;ign. They &s;aid that Forbes's men were beginning to learn the art of war, and that there were a great number of American riflemen along with the read-coats, who &s;cattered out, took trees, and were good marks-men; therefore they found they could not accompli&s;h their de&s;ign, and were obliged to retreat. When they returned from the battle to Fort DuQue&s;ne, the Indians conclued that they would go to their hunting. The French endeavored to per&s;uade them to &s;tay and try another battle. The Indians &s;aid if it was only the red-coats they had to do with, they could &s;oon &s;ubdue them, but they could not with&s;tand <HI>Asbalecoa,</HI> or the Great Knife, which was the name they gave the Virginians. They then re|turned home to their hunting, and the French evacuated the fort, which General Forbes came and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of without further oppo&s;ition, late in the year 1758, and at this time be|gan to build Fort Pitt.</P>
<P>When Tecaughretanego had heard the particulars of Grant's defeat, he &s;aid that he could not well account for his contradic|tory and incon&s;i&s;tent conduct. He &s;aid as the art of war con|&s;i&s;ts in ambu&s;hing and &s;urprizing our enemies, and in prevent|ing them from ambu&s;hing and &s;urprizing us; Grant, in the fir&s;t place, acted like a wi&s;e and experienced officer, in art|fully approaching in the night without being di&s;covered; but when he came to the place, and the Indians were lying a&s;leep out&s;ide of the fort, between him and the Allegheny river, in place of &s;lipping up quietly, and falling upon them with their
<PB N="59" REF="036317_0058_1008DC475BE5DC68">
broad &s;words, they beat the drums and played upon the bag|pipes. He &s;aid he could account for this incon&s;i&s;tent conduct no other way than by &s;uppo&s;ing that he had made too free with &s;pirituous liquors during the night, and became intoxicated about day-light. But to return:</P>
<P>This year we hunted up Sandu&s;ky, and down Sciota, and took nearly the &s;ame route that we had done the la&s;t hunting &s;ea&s;on. We had con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s, and returned to Detroit &s;ome time in April 1759.</P>
<P>Shortly after this, Tecaughretanego, his &s;on Nungany and my&s;elf, went from Detroit, (in an elm bark canoe) to Caughne|waga, a very ancient Indian town, about nine miles above Montreal, where I remained until about the fir&s;t of July. I then heard of a French &s;hip at Montreal that had Engli&s;h pri&s;on|ers on board, in order to carry them over &s;ea, and exchange them. I went privately off from the Indians, and got al&s;o on board; but as general Wolfe had &s;topped the River St. Lau|rence, we were all &s;ent to pri&s;on in Montreal, where I remain|ed four months. Some time in November we were all &s;ent off from this place to Crown Point, and exchanged.</P>
<P>Early in the year 1760, I came home to Canacocheague, and found that my people could never a&s;certain whether I was kill|ed or taken, until my return. They received me with great joy, but were &s;urprized to &s;ee me &s;o much like an Indian, both in my gait and ge&s;ture.</P>
<P>Upon enquiry, I found that my &s;weet-heart was married a few days before I arrived. My feelings I mu&s;t leave on this occa&s;ion, for tho&s;e of my readers to judge, who have felt the pangs of di&s;appointed love, as it is impo&s;&s;ible now for me to de|&s;cribe the emotion of &s;oul I felt at that time.</P>
<P>Now there was peace with the Indians which la&s;ted until the year 1763. Sometime in May, this year, I married, and about that time the Indians again commenced ho&s;tilities, and were bu&s;ily engaged in killing and &s;calping the frontier inhabitants in various parts of Penn&s;ylvania. The whole Conococheague Valley, from the North to the South Mountain, had been al|mo&s;t entirely evacuated during Braddock's war. This &s;tate was then a Quaker government, and at the fir&s;t of this war the frontiers received no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the &s;tate. As the people were now beginning to live at home again, they thought hard to be drove away a &s;econd time, and were determined if po&s;&s;ible, to make a &s;tand: therefore they rai&s;ed as much money by col|lections and &s;ub&s;criptions, as would pay a company of rifle-men for &s;everal months. The &s;ub&s;cribers met and elected a commit|tee to manage the bu&s;ine&s;s. The committee appointed me captain of this company of rangers, and gave me the appoint|ment
<PB N="60" REF="036317_0059_1008DC4C176526A8">
of my &s;ubalterns. I cho&s;e two of the mo&s;t active young men that I could find, who had al&s;o been long in captivity with the Indians. As we enli&s;ted our men, we dre&s;&s;ed them uniform|ly in the Indian manner, with breech-clouts, leggins, mocke&s;ons and green &s;hrouds, which we wore in the &s;ame manner that the Indians do, and nearly as the Highlanders wear their plaids. In place of hats we wore red hankerchiefs, and painted our fa|ces red and black, like Indian warriors. I taught them the In|dian di&s;cipline, as I knew of no other at that time, which would an&s;wer the purpo&s;e much better than Briti&s;h. We &s;ucceeded beyond expectation in defending the frontiers, and were extol|led by our employers. Near the conclu&s;ion of this expedition I accepted of an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion in the regular &s;ervice, un|der King George, in what was then called the Penn&s;ylvania line. Upon my re&s;ignation, my lieutenant &s;ucceeded me in command, the re&s;t of the time they were to &s;erve. In the fall (the &s;ame year) I went on the Su&s;quehannah campaign, again&s;t the Indians, under the command of General Arm|&s;trong. In this route we burnt the Delaware and Mon&s;ey towns, on the We&s;t Branch of the Su&s;quehannah, and de&s;troy|ed all their corn.</P>
<P>In the year 1764, I received a lieutenant's commi&s;&s;ion, and went out on General Bouquet's campaign again&s;t the Indians on the Mu&s;kingum. Here we brought them to terms, and pro|mi&s;ed to be at peace with them, upon condition that they would give up all our people that they had then in captivity among them. They then delivered unto us three hundred of the pri|&s;oners, and &s;aid that they could not collect them all at this time, as it was now late in the year, and they were far &s;cattered; but they promi&s;ed that they would bring them all into Fort Pitt early next &s;pring, and as &s;ecurity that they would do this, they delivered to us &s;ix of their chiefs, as ho&s;tages. Upon this we &s;ettled a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for &s;ix months, and promi&s;ed upon their fulfilling the afore&s;aid condition, to make with them a permanent peace.</P>
<P>A little below Fort Pitt the ho&s;tages all made their e&s;cape. Shortly after this the Indians &s;tole hor&s;es, and killed &s;ome peo|ple on the frontiers. The king's proclamation was then circu|lating and &s;et up in various public places, prohibiting any per&s;on from trading with the Indians, until further orders.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, about the fir&s;t of March 1765, a number of waggons loaded with Indian goods, and warlike &s;tores, were &s;ent from Philadelphia to Henry Pollens's, Cono|cocheague, and from thence &s;eventy pack-hor&s;es were loaded with the&s;e goods, in order to carry them to Fort Pitt. This alarmed the country, and Mr. William Duffield rai&s;ed about
<PB N="61" REF="036317_0060_1008DC4DC65BDE60">
fifty armed men, and met the pack-hor&s;es at the place where Mercer&s;burg now &s;tands. Mr. Duffield de&s;ired the employers to &s;tore up their goods, and not proceed until further orders. They made light of this, and went over the North Mountain, where they lodged in a &s;mall valley called the Great Cove. Mr. Duffield and his party followed after, and came to their lodging, and again urged them to &s;tore up their goods:&mdash;He rea&s;oned with them on the impropriety of their proceedings, and the great danger the frontier inhabitants would be expo&s;ed to, if the Indians &s;hould now get a &s;upply:&mdash;He &s;aid as it was well known that they had &s;carcely any amunition, and were almo&s;t naked, to &s;upply them now, would be a kind of murder, and would be illegally trading at the expence of the blood and trea|&s;ure of the frontiers. Notwith&s;tanding his powerful rea&s;oning, the&s;e traders made game of what he &s;aid, and would only an|&s;wer him by ludicrous burle&s;que.</P>
<P>When I beheld this, and found that Mr. Duffield would not compel them to &s;tore up their goods, I collected ten of my old warriors, that I had formerly di&s;ciplined in the Indian way, went off privately, after night, and encamped in the woods. The next day, as u&s;ual, we blacked and painted, and waylayed them near Sidelong Hill. I &s;cattered my men about forty rod along the &s;ide of the road and ordered every two to take a tree, and about eight or ten rod between each couple, with orders to keep a re&s;erve fire, one not to fire until his comrade had load|ed his gun&mdash;by this means we kept up a con&s;tant, &s;low fire, upon them from front to rear:&mdash;We then heard nothing of the&s;e tra|der's merriment or burle&s;que. When they &s;aw their pack-hor|&s;es falling clo&s;e by them, they called out <HI>pray gentlemen, what would you have us to do?</HI> The reply was, <HI>collect all your loads to the front, and unload them in one place; take your private property, and immediately retire.</HI> When they were gone, we burnt what they left, which con&s;i&s;ted of blankets, &s;hirts, ver|million, lead, beads, wampum, tomahawks, &s;calping knives, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The traders went bach to Fort Loudon, and applied to the commanding officer there, and got a party of Highland &s;oldiers, and went with them in que&s;t of the robbers, as they called us, and without applying to a magi&s;trate, or obtaining any civil au|thority, but barely upon &s;u&s;picion, they took a number of cre|ditable per&s;ons pri&s;oners, (who were chiefly not any way con|cerned in this action) and confined them in the guard-hou&s;e in Fort Loudon. I then rai&s;ed three hundred riflemen, marched to Fort Loudon, and encamped on a hill in &s;ight of the fort. We were not long there, until we had more than double as ma|ny of the Briti&s;h troops pri&s;oners in our camp, as they had of
<PB N="62" REF="036317_0061_1008DC512FAF1F70">
our people in the guard-hou&s;e. Captain Grant, a Highland officer, who command Fort Loudon, then &s;ent a flag of truce to our camp, where we &s;ettled a cartel, and gave them above two for one, which enabled us to redeem all our men from the guard-hou&s;e, without further difficulty.</P>
<P>After this Captain Grant kept a number of rifle guns, which the Highlanders had taken from the country people, and refu|&s;ed to give them up. As he was riding out one day, we took him pri&s;oner, and detained him until he delivered up the arms; we al&s;o de&s;troyed a large quantity of gun-powder that the tra|ders had &s;tored up, le&s;t it might be conveyed privately to the Indians. The king's troops, and our party, had now got en|tirely out of the channel of the civil law, and many unju&s;tifiable things were done by both parties. This convinced me more than ever I had been before, of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of the ci|vil law, in order to govern mankind.</P>
<P>About this time the following &s;ong was compo&s;ed by Mr. George Campbell (an Iri&s;h gentleman, who had been educated in Dublin) and was frequently &s;ung to the tune of the Black Joke:</P>

<P>After this we kept up a guard of men on the frontiers, for &s;everal months, to prevent &s;upplies being &s;ent to the Indians, until it was proclaimed that Sir William John&s;on had made peace with them, and then we let the traders pa&s;s unmo|le&s;ted.</P>
<P>In the year 1766, I heard that Sir William John&s;on, the king's agent for &s;ettling affairs with the Indians, had purcha&s;ed from them all the land we&s;t of the Appalachion Mountains&punc; that lay between the Chic and the Cherokee River; and as I knew by conver&s;ing with the Indians in their own tongue, that there

was a large body of rich land there, I concluded I would take a tour we&s;tward, and explore that country.</P>

<P>When we came to the mouth of Tenne&s;&s;ee, my fellow travel|lers concluded that they would proceeded on to the Illinois, and &s;ee &s;ome more of the land to the we&s;t:&mdash;this I would not agree to. As I had already been longer from home than what I ex|pectd, I thought my wife would be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and think I was killed by the Indians; therefore I concluded that I would re|turn home. I &s;ent my hor&s;e with my fellow travellers to the Illinois, as it was difficult to take a hor&s;e through the moun|tains. My comrades gave me the greate&s;t part of the amuni|tion they then had, which amounted only to half a pound of pow|der, and lead equivalent. Mr. Horton al&s;o lent me his mulatto boy, and I then &s;et off through the wilderne&s;s, for Carolina.</P>
<P>About eight days after I left my company at the mouth of Tenne&s;&s;ee, on my journey ea&s;tward, I got a cane &s;tab in my foot, which occa&s;ioned my leg to &s;well, and I &s;uffered much pain. I was now in a doleful &s;ituation&mdash;far from any of the human &s;pecies, excepting black Jamie, or the &s;avages, and I knew not when I might meet with them&mdash;my ca&s;e appeared de&s;perate, and I thought &s;omething mu&s;t be done. All the &s;urgical in&s;truments I had, was a knife, a mocka&s;on awl, and a pair of bullit moulds&mdash;with the&s;e I determined to draw the &s;nag from my foot, if po&s;&s;ible. I &s;tuck the awl in the &s;kin, and with the knife I cut the fle&s;h away from around the cane, and then I commanded the mulatto fellow to catch it with the bul|lit moulds, and pull it out, which he did. When I &s;aw it, it &s;eemed a &s;hocking thing to be in any per&s;on's foot; it will there|fore be &s;uppo&s;ed that I was very glad to have it out. The black fellow attended upon me, and obeyed my directions faith|fully. I ordered him to &s;earch for Indian medicine, and told him to get me a quantity of bark from the root of a lynn tree,
<PB N="65" REF="036317_0064_1008DC5BF70E8F08">
which I made him beat on a &s;tone, with a tomahawk, and boil it in a kettle, and with the ooze I bathed my foot and leg:&mdash; what remained when I had fini&s;hed bathing, I boiled to a jelly, and made poultices thereof. As I had no rags, I made u&s;e of the green mo&s;s that grows upon logs, and wrapped it round with elm bark: by this means (&s;imple as it may &s;eem) the &s;wel|ling and inflamation in a great mea&s;ure abated. As &s;tormy weather appeared, I ordered Jamie to make us a &s;helter, which he did by erecting forks and poles, and covering them over with cane tops, like a fodder-hou&s;e. It was but about one hundred yards from a large buffaloe road. As we were almo&s;t out of provi&s;ion, I commanded Jamie to take my gun, and I went along as well as I could, concealed my&s;elf near the road, and killed a buffaloe. When this was done, we jirked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jirk is a name well known by the hunters, and frontier inhabitants, for meat cut in &s;mall pieces and laid on a &s;caffold, over a &s;low fire, whereby it is roa&s;ted till it is thoroughly dry.</NOTE> the lean, and fryed the tallow out of the fat meat, which we kept to &s;tew with our jirk as we needed it.</P>
<P>While I lay at this place, all the books I had to read, was a P&s;alm Book, and Watts upon Prayer. Whil&s;t in this &s;itu|ation I compo&s;ed the following ver&s;es, which I then frequent|ly &s;ung.</P>

<P>I continued in this place until I could walk &s;lowly, without crutches. As I now lay near a great buffaloe road, I was afraid that the Indians might be pa&s;&s;ing that way, and di&s;cover
<PB N="66" REF="036317_0065_1008DC5D893BDC70">
any fire-place, therefore I moved off &s;ome di&s;tance, where I re|mained until I killed an elk. As my foot was yet &s;ore, I con|cluded that I would &s;tay here until it was healed, le&s;t by travelling too &s;oon it might again be inflamed.</P>
<P>In a few weeks after, I proceeded on, and in October I arri|ved in Carolina. I had now been eleven months in the wilder|ne&s;s, and during this time I neither &s;aw bread, money, women, or &s;pirituous liquors; and three months of which I &s;aw none of the human &s;pecies, except Jamie.</P>
<P>When I came into the &s;ettlement, my clothes were almo&s;t worn out, and the boy had nothing on him that ever was &s;pun. He had buck-&s;kin leggins, mocka&s;ons and breech-clout&mdash;a bear-&s;kin dre&s;&s;ed with the hair on, which he belted about him, and a racoon-&s;kin cap. I had not travelled far after I came in be|fore I was &s;trictly examined by the inhabitants. I told them the truth, and where I came from, &amp;c. but my &s;tory appeared &s;o &s;trange to them, that they did not believe me. They &s;aid they had never heard of any one coming through the mountains from the mouth of Tenne&s;&s;ee; and if any one would undertake &s;uch a journey, &s;urely no man would lend him his &s;lave. They &s;aid that they thought that all I had told them were lies, and on &s;u&s;picion they took me into cu&s;tody, and &s;et a guard over me.</P>
<P>While I was confined here, I met with a reputable old ac|quaintance, who voluntarily became my voucher; and al&s;o told me of a number of my acquaintances that now lived near this place, who had moved from Penn&s;ylvania&mdash;On this being made public, I was liberated. I went to a magi&s;trate, and obtained a pa&s;s, and one of my old acquaintances made me a pre&s;ent of a &s;hirt. I then ca&s;t away my old rags, and all the clothes I now had was an old beaver hat, buck-&s;kin leggins, mocka&s;ons, and a new &s;hirt; al&s;o an old blanket, which I commonly carried on my back in good weather. Being thus equipped, I marched on, with my white &s;hirt loo&s;e, and Jamie with his bear-&s;kin about him:&mdash;my&s;elf appearing white, and Jamie very black, alarmed the dogs where-ever we came, &s;o that they barked violently. The people frequently came out and a&s;ked me where we came from, &amp;c. I told them the truth, but they, for the mo&s;t part &s;u&s;pected my &s;tory, and I generally had to &s;hew them my pa&s;s. In this way I came on to Fort Chi&s;&s;el, where I left Jamie at Mr. Horton's negro-quarter, according to promi&s;e. I went from thence to Mr. George Adams's, on Reed Creek, where I had lodged, and where I had left my clothes as I was going out from home. When I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in good clothes, and moun|ted on hor&s;eback, no man ever a&s;ked me for a pa&s;s; therefore I concluded that a hor&s;e-thief, or even a robber, might pa&s;s
<PB N="67" REF="036317_0066_1008DC637B3DCD50">
without interruption, provided he was only well dre&s;&s;ed, where|as the &s;habby villain would be immediately detected.</P>
<P>I returned home to Conococheague, in the fall 1767. When I arrived, I found that my wife and friends had de&s;paired of ever &s;eeing me again, as they had heard that I was killed by the Indians, and my hor&s;e brought into one of the Cherokee towns.</P>
<P>In the year 1769, the Indians again made incur&s;ions on the frontiers; yet, the traders continued carrying goods and war|like &s;tores to them. The frontiers took the alarm, and a num|ber of per&s;ons collected, de&s;troyed and plundered a quantity of their powder, lead, &amp;c. in Bedford county. Shortly after this, &s;ome of the&s;e per&s;ons, with others, were apprehended and laid in irons in the guard-hou&s;e in Fort Bedford, on &s;u&s;picion of being the perpetrators of this crime.</P>
<P>Though I did not altogether approve of the conduct of this new club of black-boys, yet I concluded that they &s;hould not lie in irons in the guard-hou&s;e, or remain in confinement, by arbitrary or military power. I re&s;olved therefore, if po&s;&s;ible, to relea&s;e them, if they even &s;hould be tried by the civil law afterwards. I collected eighteen of my old black-boys, that I had &s;een tried in the Indian war, &amp;c. I did not de&s;ire a large party, le&s;t they &s;hould be too much alarmed at Bedford, and ac|cordingly prepare for us. We marched along the public road in day-light, and made no &s;ecret of our de&s;ign:&mdash;We told tho&s;e whom we met, that we were going to take Fort Bedford, which appeared to them a very unlikely &s;tory. Before this I made it known to one William Thomp&s;on, a man whom I could tru&s;t, and who lived there: him I employed as a &s;py, and &s;ent him along on hor&s;e-back, before, with orders to meet me at a cer|tain place near Bedford, one hour before day. The next day a little before &s;un-&s;et we encamped near the cro&s;&s;ings of Juni|ata, about fourteen miles from Bedford, and erected tents, as though we intended &s;taying all night, and not a man in my com|pany knew to the contrary, &s;ave my&s;elf. Knowing that they would hear this in Bedford, and wi&s;hing it to be the ca&s;e, I thought to &s;urprize them, by &s;tealing a march.</P>
<P>As the moon ro&s;e about eleven o'clock, I ordered my boys to march, and we went on at the rate of five miles an hour, until we met Thomp&s;on at the place appointed. He told us that the commanding officer had frequently heard of us by tra|vellers, and had ordered thirty men upon guard. He &s;aid they knew our number, and only made game of the notion of eigh|teen men coming to re&s;cue the pri&s;oners, but they did not ex|pect us until towards the middle of the day. I a&s;ked him if the gate was open? He &s;aid it was then &s;hut, but he expected they would open it as u&s;ual, at day-light, as they apprehended no
<PB N="68" REF="036317_0067_1008DC65065206D8">
danger. I then moved my men privately up under the banks of Juniata, where we lay concealed about one hundred yards from the fort gate. I had ordered the men to keep a pro|found &s;ilence, until we got into it. I then &s;ent off Thomp&s;on again, to &s;py. At day-light he returned, and told us that the gate was open, and three centinels were &s;tanding on the wall&mdash; that the guards were taking a morning dram, and the arms &s;tanding together in one place. I then concluded to ru&s;h into the fort, and told Thomp&s;on to run before me to the arms. We ran with all our might, and as it was a mi&s;ty mor|ning, the centinels &s;carcely &s;aw us until we were within the gate, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the arms. Ju&s;t as we were entering, two of them di&s;charged their guns, though I do not believe they aimed at us. We then rai&s;ed a &s;hout, which &s;urprized the town, though &s;ome of them were well plea&s;ed with the news. We compelled a black-&s;mith to take the irons off the pri&s;oners, and then we left the place. This, I believe, was the fir&s;t Bri|ti&s;h fort in America, that was taken by what they called A|merican rebels.</P>
<P>Some time after this I took a journey we&s;tward, in order to &s;urvey &s;ome located land I had on and near the Youhogany. As I pa&s;&s;ed near Bedford, while I was walking and leading my hor&s;e, I was overtaken by &s;ome men on hor&s;e-back, like travel|lers. One of them a&s;ked my name, and on telling it, they im|mediately pulled out their pi&s;tols, and pre&s;ented them at me, calling upon me to deliver my&s;elf, or I was a dead man. I &s;tep|ped back, pre&s;ented my rifle, and told them to &s;tand off. One of them &s;napped a pi&s;tol at me, and another was preparing to &s;hoot, when I fired my piece:&mdash;one of them al&s;o fired near the &s;ame time, and one of my fellow travellers fell. The a&s;&s;ailants then ru&s;hed up, and as my gun was empty, they took and tied me. I charged them with killing my fellow traveller, and told them he was a man that I had accidentally met with on the road, that had nothing to do with the public quarrel. They a&s;&s;erted that I had killed him. I told them that my gun blow|ed, or made a &s;low fire&mdash;that I had her from my face before &s;he went off, or I would not have mi&s;&s;ed my mark; and from the po&s;ition my piece was in when it went off, it was not likely that my gun killed this man, yet I acknowledged I was not certain that it was not &s;o. They then carried me to Bed|ford, laid me in irons in the guard-hou&s;e, &s;ummoned a jury of the opp&s;ite party, and held an inque&s;t. The jury brought me in guilty of wilful murder. As they were afraid to keep me long in Bedford, for fear of a re&s;cue, they &s;ent me privately through the wilderne&s;s to Carli&s;le, where I was laid in heavy irons.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="036317_0068_1008DC6A20687A70">Shortly after I came here, we heard that a number of my old black boys were coming to tear down the jail. I told the &s;he|riff that I would not be re&s;cued, as I knew that the indictment was wrong; therefore I wi&s;hed to &s;tand my trial. As I had found the black boys to be always under good command, I ex|pected I could prevail on them to return, and therefore wi&s;h|ed to write to them&mdash;to this the &s;heriff readily agreed. I wrote a letter to them, with irons on my hands, which was immedi|ately &s;ent; but as they had heard that I was in irons, they would come on. When we heard they were near the town, I told the &s;heriff I would &s;peak to them out of the window, and if the irons were off, I made no doubt but I could prevail on them to de&s;i&s;t. The &s;heriff ordered them to be taken off, and ju&s;t as they were taken off my hands, the black boys came running up to the jail. I went to the window and called to them, and they gave attention. I told them as my indictment was for wilful murder, to admit of being re&s;cued, would appear di&s;honorable. I thanked them for their kind intentions, and told them the greate&s;t favor they could confer upon me, would be to grant me this one reque&s;t, <HI>to withdraw from the jail, and return in peace</HI>: to this they complied, and withdrew. While I was &s;peaking, the irons were taken off my feet, and never again put on.</P>
<P>Before this party arrived at Conococheague, they met about three hundred more, on the way, coming to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and were re&s;olved to take me out; they then turned, and all came together, to Carli&s;le. The rea&s;on they gave for coming again, was, becau&s;e they thought that government was &s;o enraged at me that I would not get a fair trial; but my friends and my&s;elf together again prevailed on them to return in peace.</P>

<P>Whereas, in this Gazette of September 28th, 1769, there appeared an extract of a letter from Bedford, September 12th, 1769, relative to James Smith, as being apprehended on &s;u&s;pi|cion of being a black boy, then killing his companion, &amp;c. I look upon my&s;elf as bound by all the obligations of truth, ju&s;|tice
<PB N="70" REF="036317_0069_1008DC6D2E659040">
to character and to the world, to &s;et that matter in a true light; by which, I hope the impartial world will be enabled to obtain a more ju&s;t opinion of the pre&s;ent &s;cheme of acting in this end of the country, as al&s;o to form a true idea of the truth, candor, and ingenuity of the author of the &s;aid extract, in &s;ta|ting that matter in &s;o partial a light. The &s;tate of the ca&s;e (which can be made appear by undeniable evidence,) was this: "James Smith, (who is &s;tiled the principal ring leader of the black boys, by the &s;aid author) together with his younger bro|ther, and brother-in-law, were going out in order to &s;urvey and improve their land on the waters of Youghoghany, and as the time of their return was long, they took with them their arms, and hor&s;es loaded with the nece&s;&s;aries of life: and as one of Smith's brothers-in-law was an arti&s;t in &s;urveying, he had al|&s;o with him the in&s;truments for that bu&s;ine&s;s. Travelling on the way, within about nine miles of Bedford, they overtook, and joined company with one John&s;on and Moorhead, who like|wi&s;e had hor&s;es loaded, part of which loading was liquor, and part &s;eed wheat, their intentions being to make improvements on their lands. When they arrived at the parting of the road on this &s;ide Bedford, the company &s;eparated, one part going through the town, in order to get a hor&s;e &s;hod, were apprehended, and put under confinement, but for what crime they knew not, and treated in a manner utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the laws of their country, and the liberties of Engli&s;hmen:&mdash;Whil&s;t the other part, viz. James Smith, John&s;on and Moorhead, taking along the other road, were met by John Holmes e&s;q. to whom James Smith &s;poke in a friendly manner, but received no an&s;wer. Mr. Holmes ha&s;ted, and gave an alarm in Bedford, from whence a party of men were &s;ent in pur&s;uit of them; but Smith and his companions not having the lea&s;t thought of any &s;uch mea|&s;ures being taken, (why &s;hould they?) travelled &s;lowly on. After they had gained the place where the roads joined, they delayed until the other part of their company &s;hould come up. At this time a number of men came riding, like men travelling; they a&s;ked Smith his name, which he told them&mdash;on which they immediately a&s;&s;aulted him as highway-men, and with pre&s;ented pi&s;tols, commanded him to &s;urrender, or he was a dead man; upon which Smith &s;tepped back, a&s;ked them if they were high|way-men, charging them at the &s;ame time to &s;tand off, when im|mediately, Robert George (one of the a&s;&s;ailants) &s;napped a pi&s;|tol at Smith's head, and that before Smith offered to &s;hoot, (which &s;aid George him&s;elf acknowled upon oath;) whereupon Smith pre&s;ented his gun at another of the a&s;&s;ailants, who was preparing to &s;hoot him with his pi&s;tol. The &s;aid a&s;&s;ailant ha|ving a hold of John&s;on by the arm, two &s;hots were fired, one
<PB N="71" REF="036317_0070_1008DC7081AA0E50">
by Smith's gun, the other from a pi&s;tol, &s;o quick as ju&s;t to be di&s;tingui&s;hable, and John&s;on fell. After which Smith was ta|ken and carried into Bedford, where John Holmes, e&s;q. the in|former, held an inque&s;t on the corp&s;e, one of the a&s;&s;ailants being as an evidence, (nor was there any other troubled about the matter) Smith was brought in guilty of wilful murder, and &s;o committed to pri&s;on. But a jealou&s;y ari&s;ing in the brea&s;ts of many that the inque&s;t, either through inadvertency, ignorance or &s;ome other default, was not &s;o fair as it ought to be; Wil|liam Deny, corroner of the county, upon requi&s;ion made, thought proper to re-examine the matter, and &s;ummoning a ju|ry of unexceptionable men, out of three town&s;hips&mdash;men who&s;e candor, probity and hone&s;ty, is unque&s;tionable with all who are acquainted with them, and having rai&s;ed the corp&s;e, held an inque&s;t in a &s;olemn manner, during three days. In the cour&s;e of their &s;crutiny they found John&s;on's &s;hirt blacked about the bullit-hole, by the powder of the charge by which he was killed, whereupon they examined into the di&s;tance Smith &s;tood from John&s;on when he &s;hot, and one of the a&s;&s;ailants being ad|mitted to oath, &s;wore to the re&s;pective &s;pots of ground they both &s;tood on at that time, which the jury mea&s;ured, and found to be twenty-three feet, nearly; then trying the experiment of &s;hooting at the &s;ame &s;hirt, both with and again&s;t the wind, and at the &s;ame di&s;tance, found no effects, not the lea&s;t &s;tain from the powder, on the &s;hirt:&mdash;And let any per&s;on that plea&s;es, make the experiment, and I will venture to affirm he &s;hall find that powder will not &s;tain at half the di&s;tance above mentioned, if &s;hot out of a rifle gun, which Smith's was. Upon the whole, the jury, after the mo&s;t accurate examination, and mature deli|beration, brought in their verdict that &s;ome one of the a&s;&s;ail|ants them&s;elves mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been the perpetrators of the murder.</P>
<P>I have now repre&s;ented the matter in its true and genuine colors, and which I will abide by. I only beg liberty to make a few remarks and reflections on the above mentioned extract. The author &s;ays "James Smith, with two others in company, pa&s;&s;ed round the town, without touching," by which it is plain he would in&s;inuate, and make the public believe that Smith, and that part of the company, had taken &s;ome bye road, which is utterly fal&s;e, for it was the king's high-way, and the &s;traighte&s;t, that through Bedford, being &s;omething to the one &s;ide, nor would the other part of the company have gone through the town, but for the rea&s;on already given. Again, the author &s;ays that "four men were &s;ent in pur&s;uit of Smith and his com|panions, who overtook them about five miles from Bedford, and commanded them to &s;urrender, on which Smith pre&s;ented his
<PB N="72" REF="036317_0071_1008DC7208484CE0">
gun at one of the men, who was &s;truggling with his compani|on, fired it at him, and &s;hot his companion through the back." Here I would ju&s;t remark again, the unfair and partial account given of this matter, by the author; not a word mentioned of George's &s;napping his pi&s;tol before Smith offered to &s;hoot, or of another of the a&s;&s;ailants actually firing his pi&s;tol, though he confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf afterwards, he had done &s;o; not the lea&s;t mention of the company's baggage, which, to men in the lea&s;t open to a fair enquiry, would have been &s;ufficient proof of the innocence of their intentions. Mu&s;t not an effu&s;ive blu&s;h over|&s;pread the face of the partial repre&s;enter of facts, when he finds the veil he had thrown over truth thus pulled a&s;ide, and &s;he ex|po&s;ed to naked view. Suppo&s;e it &s;hould be granted that Smith &s;hot the man, (which is not, and I pre&s;ume never can be pro|ven to be the ca&s;e) I would only a&s;k, was he not on his own de|fence? Was he not publicly a&s;&s;aulted? Was he not charged at the peril of his life, to &s;urrender, without knowing for what? No warrant being &s;hown him, or any declaration made of their authority. And &s;eeing the&s;e things are &s;o, would any judicious man, any per&s;on in the lea&s;t acquainted with the laws of the land, or morality, judge him guilty of wilful murder? But I humbly pre&s;ume every one who has an opportunity of &s;eeing this, will by this time be convinced that the proceedings again&s;t Smith were truly unlawful and tyranical, perhaps unparalleled by any in&s;tance in a civilized nation; for to endeavor to kill a man in the apprehending him, in order to bring him to trial for a fact, and that too on a &s;uppo&s;ed one, is undoubtedly beyond all bounds of law or government.</P>
<P>If the author of the extract thinks I have treated him un|fair, or that I have advanced any thing he can controvert, let him come forward as a fair antagoni&s;t, and make his defence, and I will, if called upon, vindicate all that I have advanced again&s;t him or his abettors.</P>

<P>I remained in pri&s;on four months, and during this time I of|ten thought of tho&s;e that were confined in the time of the per&s;ecution, who declared their pri&s;on was converted into a palace.

<P>When the &s;upreme court &s;at, I was &s;everely pro&s;ecuted. At the commencement of my trial, the judges in a very unju&s;t and arbitrary manner, rejected &s;everal of my evidences; yet, as Robert George (one of tho&s;e who were in the fray when I was taken) &s;wore in court that he &s;napped a pi&s;tol at me before I &s;hot, and a concurrence of corroborating circum&s;tances, am|ounted

to &s;trong pre&s;umptive evidence that it could not po&s;&s;ibly be my gun that killed John&s;on, the jury, without he&s;itation, brought in their verdict, NOT GUILTY. One of the judges then declared that not one of this jury &s;hould ever hold any office above a con&s;table. Notwith&s;tanding this proud, ill-natu|red declaration, &s;ome of the&s;e jurymen afterwards filled honor|able places, and I my&s;elf was elected the next year, and &s;at on the board<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A board of commi&s;&s;ioners was annually elected in Penn&s;ylvania, to regu|late taxes, and lay the county levy.</NOTE> in Bedford county, and afterwards I &s;erved in the board three years in We&s;tmoreland county.</P>
<P>In the year 1774, another Indian war commenced, though at this time the white people were the aggre&s;&s;ors. The pro&s;pect of this terrified the frontier inhabitants, in&s;omuch that the greater part on the Ohio waters, either fled over the mountains, ea&s;tward, or collected into forts. As the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania apprehended great danger, they at this time appointed me cap|tain over what was then called the Penn&s;ylvania line. As they knew I could rai&s;e men that would an&s;wer their purpo&s;e, they &s;eemed to lay a&s;ide their former inveteracy.</P>
<P>In the year 1776, I was appointed a major in the Penn&s;yl|vania a&s;&s;ociation. When American independence was decla|red, I was elected a member of the convention in We&s;tmore|land county, &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, and of the a&s;&s;embly as long as I propo&s;ed to &s;erve.</P>

We marched into the Jer&s;eys, and went before General Wa&s;hington's army, way-laid the road at Rocky Hill, attacked about two hundred of the Briti&s;h, and with thirty-&s;ix men drove them out of the woods into a large open field. After this we attacked a party that were guarding the officers baggage, and took the waggon and twenty two He&s;&s;ians; and al&s;o re-took &s;ome of our conti|nental &s;oldiers which they had with them. In a few days we killed and took more of the Briti&s;h, than was of our party. At this time I took the camp fever, and was carried in a &s;tage waggon to Burlington, where I lay until I recovered. When I took &s;ick, my companion, Major James M'Common, took the command of the party, and had greater &s;ucce&s;s than I had. If every officer and his party that lifted arms again&s;t the Engli&s;h, had fought with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s that Major M'Common did, we would have made &s;hort work of the Briti&s;h war.</P>

<P>With the&s;e, and &s;ome other letters of recommendation, which I have not now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I went to his excellency, who lay at Morri&s;town. Though General Wa&s;hington did not fall in with the &s;cheme of white-men turning Indians, yet he pro|po&s;ed giving me a major's place in a battallion of rifle men al|ready rai&s;ed. I thanked the general for his propo&s;al; but as I entertained no high opinion of the colonel that I was to &s;erve under, and with him I had no pro&s;pect of getting my old boys again, I thought I would be of more u&s;e in the cau&s;e we were then &s;truggling to &s;upport, to remain with them as a militia of|ficer, therefore I did not accept this offer.</P>
<P>In the year 1778, I received a colonel's commi&s;&s;ion, and af|ter my return to We&s;tmoreland, the indians made an attack upon our frontiers. I then rai&s;ed men and pur&s;ued them, and the &s;econd day we overtook and defeated them. We likewi&s;e took four &s;calps, and recovered the hor&s;es and plunder which they were carrying off. At the time of this attack, Captain John Hink&s;ton pur&s;ued an Indian, both their guns being empty, and after the fray was over he was mi&s;&s;ing:&mdash;While we were enquiring about him, he came walking up, &s;eemingly unconcern|ed, with a bloody &s;calp in his hand&mdash;he had pur&s;ued the Indian about a quarter of a mile, and tomahawked him.</P>
<P>Not long after this I was called upon to command four hun|dred riflemen, on an expedition again&s;t the Indian town on French Creek. It was &s;ome time in November, before I re|ceived orders from General M'Into&s;h, to march, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> were poorly equipped, and &s;carce of provi&s;ions. We marched in three columns, forty rod from each other. There were all flankers on the out&s;ide of each column, that marched a-brea&s;t in the rear, in &s;cattered order&mdash;and even in the columns, the men were one rod apart&mdash;and in the front&punc; the volunteers marched a-brea&s;t, in the &s;ame manner of the flankers, &s;couring the woods. In ca&s;e of an attack, the officers were immediate|ly to order the men to face out and take trees&mdash;in this po&s;ition the Indians could not avail them&s;elves by &s;urrounding us, or
<PB N="76" REF="036317_0075_1008DC7E516CB180">
have an opportunity of &s;hooting a man from either &s;ide of the tree. If attacked, the centre column was to reinforce what|ever part appeared to require it mo&s;t. When we encamped, our encampment formed a hollow &s;quare, including about thir|ty or forty acres&mdash;on the out&s;ide of the &s;quare there were cen|tinels placed, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to watch for the enemy, and &s;ee that neither hor&s;es or bullocks went out:&mdash;And when encamped, if any attacks were made by an enemy, each officer was immediately to order the men to face out and take trees, as before mentioned; and in this form they could not take the advantage by &s;urrounding us, as they commonly had done when they fought the whites.</P>
<P>The following is a copy of general orders, given at this time, which I have found among my journals:</P>

GENERAL ORDERS: A copy thereof is to be given to each captain and subaltern, and to be read to each company.</HEAD>
<P>You are to march in three columns, with flankers on the front and rear, and to keep a profound &s;ilence, and not to fire a gun, except at the enemy, without particular orders for that purpo&s;e; and in ca&s;e of an attack, let it be &s;o ordered that every other man only, is to &s;hoot at once, excepting on extra|ordinary occa&s;ions. The one half of the men to keep a re&s;erve fire, until their comrades load; and let every one be particular|ly careful not to fire at any time, without a view of the enemy, and that not at too great a di&s;tance. I earne&s;tly urge the above caution, as I have known very remarkable and grievous errors of this kind. You are to encamp on the hollow &s;quare, except the volunteers, who, according to their own reque&s;t, are to en|camp on the front of the &s;quare. A &s;ufficient number of cen|tinels are to be kept round the &s;quare, at a proper di&s;tance. Every man is to be under arms at the break of day, and to pa|rade oppo&s;ite to their fire-places, facing out, and when the offi|cers examine their arms, and find them in good order, and give nece&s;&s;ary directions, they are to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with orders to have their arms near them, and be always in readine&s;s.</P>

<P>In this manner we proceeded on, to French Creek, where we found the Indian town evacuated. I then went on further than my orders called for, in que&s;t of Indians; but our provi|&s;ions being nearly exhau&s;ted, we were obliged to return. On
<PB N="77" REF="036317_0076_1008DC8166103788">
our way back, we met with con&s;iderable difficulties on account of high waters and &s;carcity of provi&s;ion; yet we never lo&s;t one hor&s;e, excepting &s;ome that gave out.</P>
<P>After peace was made with the Indians, I met with &s;ome of them in Pitt&s;burg, and enquired of them in their own tongue, concerning this expedition,&mdash;not letting them know I was there. They told me that they watched the movements of this army ever after they had left Fort-Pitt, and as they pa&s;&s;ed thro the glades or barrens they had a full view of them from the adja|cent hills and computed their number to be be about one thou|&s;and. They &s;aid they al&s;o examined their camps, both before and after they were gone, and found, they could not make an ad|vantageous attack, and therefore moved off from their town and hunting ground before we arrived.</P>
<P>In the year 1788 I &s;ettled in Bourbon county, Kentucky, &s;e|ven miles above Paris; and in the &s;ame year was elected a member of the convention, that &s;at at Danville, to confer about a &s;eparation from the &s;tate of Virginia.&mdash;and from that year un|til the year 1799, I repre&s;ented Bourbon county, either in con|vention or as a member of the general a&s;&s;embly, except two years that I was left a few votes behind.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ON THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE INDIANS.</HEAD>
<P>The Indians are a &s;lovenly people in their dre&s;s.&mdash;They &s;eldom ever wa&s;h their &s;hirts, and in regard to cookery they are exceeding filthy. When they kill a buffaloe they will &s;ome|times la&s;h the paunch of it round a &s;apling, and ca&s;t it into the kettle, boil it and &s;up the broth; tho they commonly &s;hake it a|bout in cold water, then boil and eat it.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding all this, they are very polite in their own way, and they retain a|mong them, the e&s;&s;entials of good manners; tho they have few compliments, yet they are complai&s;ant to one another, and when accompanied with good humour and di&s;cretion, they entertain &s;trangers in the be&s;t manner their circum&s;tances will admit. They u&s;e but few titles of honor. In the military line, the titles of great men are only captains or leaders of parties&mdash;In the civil line, the titles are only councilors, chiefs or the old wi&s;emen. The&s;e titles are never made u&s;e of in addre&s;&s;ing any of their great men. The language commonly made u&s;e of in addre&s;&s;ing them, is, Grandfather, Father, or Uncle. They have no &s;uch thing in u&s;e among them, as Sir, Mr. Madam or Mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;The common mode of addre&s;s, is, my Friend, Brother, Cou&s;in, or Mother Si&s;ter, &amp;c. They pay great re&s;pect to age; or to the
<PB N="78" REF="036317_0077_1008DC8613475D20">
aged Fathers and Mothers among them of every rank. No one can arrive at any place of honor, among them, but by merit. Either &s;ome exploit in war, mu&s;t be performed, before any one can be advanced in the military line, or become eminent for wi&s;dom before they can obtain a &s;eat in council. It would ap|pear to the Indians a mo&s;t ridiculous thing to &s;ee a man lead off a company of warriors, as an officer, who had him&s;elf never been in a battle in his life: even in ca&s;e of merit, they are &s;low in advancing any one, until they arrive at or near middle-age.</P>
<P>They invite every one that comes to their hou&s;e, or camp to eat, while they have any thing to give; and it is accounted bad manners to refu&s;e eating, when invited. They are very tenaci|ous of their old mode of dre&s;&s;ing and painting, and do not change their fa&s;hions as we do. They are very fond of tobacco, and the men almo&s;t all &s;moke it mixed with &s;umach leaves or red willow bark, pulverized; tho they &s;eldom u&s;e it any other way. They make u&s;e of the pipe al&s;o as a token of love and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>In court&s;hip they al&s;o differ from us. It is a common thing a|mong them for a young woman, if in love, to make &s;uit to a young man: tho the fir&s;t addre&s;s may be by the man; yet the other is the mo&s;t common. The &s;quaws are generally very im|mode&s;t in their words and actions, and will often put the young men to the blu&s;h. The men commonly appear to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much more mode&s;ty than the women; yet I have been ac|quainted with &s;ome young &s;quaws that appeared really mode&s;t: genuine it mu&s;t be, as they were under very little re&s;traint in the channel of education or cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>When the Indians meet one-another, in&s;tead of &s;aying, how do you do, they commonly &s;alute in the following manner&mdash;you are my friend&mdash;the reply is, truly friend, I am your friend,&mdash;or, cou&s;in, you yet exi&s;t&mdash;the reply is certainly I do.&mdash;They have their children under tolerable command: &s;eldom ever whip them, and their common mode of cha&s;ti&s;ing, is by ducking them in cold water; therefore their children are more obedient in the winter &s;ea&s;on, than they are in the &s;ummer; tho they are then not &s;o often ducked. They are a peaceable people, and &s;carcely ever wrangle or &s;cold, when &s;ober; but they are very much addicted to drinking, and men and women will become ba&s;ely intoxicated, if they can, by any means, procure or obtain &s;pirituous liquor; and then they are commonly either extremely merry and kind, or very turbulent, ill-humoured and di&s;orderly.</P>

<HEAD>ON THEIR TRADITIONS AND RELIGIOUS SEN|TIMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>As the family that I was adopted into was intermarried with the Wiandots and Ottawas, three tongues were commonly &s;poke
<PB N="79" REF="036317_0078_1008DC8932F6E3E8">
viz. Caughnewaga, or what the French call Iroque, al&s;o the Wiandot and Ottawa; by this means I had an opportunity of learning the&s;e three tongues; and I found that the&s;e nations varied in their traditions and opinions concerning religion;&mdash; and even numbers of the &s;ame nations differed widely in their religious &s;entiments. Their traditions are vague, whim&s;ical, ro|mantic and many of them &s;carce worth relating; and not any of them reach back to the creation of the world. The Wian|dots comes the neare&s;t to this. They tell of a &s;quaw that was found when an infant, in the water in a canoe made of bull-ru&s;h|es: this &s;quaw became a great prophetre&s;s and did many won|derful things; &s;he turned water into dry land, and at length made this continent, which was, at that time, only a very &s;mall i&s;land, and but a few Indians in it. Tho they were then but few they had not &s;ufficient room to hunt; therefore this &s;quaw went to the water &s;ide, and prayed that this little i&s;land might be enlarged. The great being then heard her prayer, and &s;ent great numbers of Water Tortoi&s;es, and Mu&s;krats, which brought with them mud and other materials, for enlarging this i&s;land, and by this means, they &s;ay, it was encrea&s;ed to the &s;ize that it now remains; therefore they &s;ay, that the white people ought not to encroach upon them, or take their land from them, be|cau&s;e their great grand mother made it.&mdash;They &s;ay, that about this time the angels or heavenly inhabitants, as they call them, frequently vi&s;ited them and talked with their forefathers; and gave directions how to pray, and how to appea&s;e the great being when he was offended. They told them they were to offer &s;a|crifice, burn tobacco, buffaloe and deer bones; but that they were not to burn bears or racoons bones in &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>The Ottawas &s;ay, that there are two great beings that rule and govern the univer&s;e, who are at war with each other; the one they call <HI>Maneto,</HI> and the other <HI>Matchemaneto.</HI> They &s;ay that Maneto is all kindne&s;s and love, and that Matchema|neto is an evil &s;pirit, that delights in doing mi&s;chief; and &s;ome of them think, that they are equal in power, and therefore wor&s;hip the evil &s;pirit out of a principle of fear. Others doubt which of the two may be the mo&s;t powerful, and therefore en|deavour to keep in favour with both, by giving each of them &s;ome kind of wor&s;hip. Others &s;ay that Maneto is the fir&s;t great cau&s;e and therefore mu&s;t be all powerful and &s;upreme, and ought to be adored and wor&s;hipped; whereas Matchemaneto ought to be rejected and di&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the Ottawas that wor&s;hip the evil &s;pirit, pretend to be great conjurors. I think if there is any &s;uch thing now in the world as witchcraft, it is among the&s;e people, I have been told wonderful &s;tories concerning their proceedings; but never
<PB N="80" REF="036317_0079_1008DC8AB97D4900">
was ye witne&s;s to any thing that appeared evidently &s;uperna|tural.</P>
<P>Some of the Wiandots and Caughnewagas profe&s;s to be Ro|man-catholics; but even the&s;e retain many of the notions of their ance&s;tors. Tho&s;e of them who reject the Roman-catholic religion, hold that there is one great fir&s;t cau&s;e, whom they call <HI>Owan<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">eya,</HI> that rules and governs the univer&s;e, and takes care of all his creatures, rational and irrational, and gives them their food in due &s;ea&s;on, and hears the prayers of all tho&s;e that call upon him; therefore it is but ju&s;t and rea&s;onable to pray, and offer &s;acrifice to this great being, and to do tho&s;e things that are plea&s;ing in his &s;ight;&mdash;but they differ widely in what is plea&s;ing or di&s;plea&s;ing to this great being. Some hold that following nature or their own propen&s;ities is the way to happi|ne&s;s, and cannot be di&s;plea&s;ing to the deity, becau&s;e he delights in the happine&s;s of his creatures, and does nothing in vain; but gave tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions with a de&s;ign to lead to happine&s;s, and therefore they ought to be followed. Others reject this o|pinion altogether, and &s;ay that following their own propen&s;ities in this manner, is neither the means of happine&s;s nor the way to plea&s;e the deity.</P>
<P>Tecaughretanego was of opinion that following nature in a limited &s;en&s;e was rea&s;onable and right. He &s;aid that mo&s;t of the irrational animals by following their natural propen&s;ities, were led to the greate&s;t pitch of happine&s;s that their natures and the world they lived in would admit of. He &s;aid that man|kind and the rattle &s;nakes had evil di&s;po&s;itions, that led them to injure them&s;elves and others. He gave in&s;tances of this. He &s;aid he had a puppy that he did not intend to rai&s;e, and in order to try an experiment, he tyed this puppy on a pole and held it to a rattle &s;nake, which bit it &s;everal times; that he ob&s;erved the &s;nake &s;hortly after, rolling about apparently in great mi&s;ery, &s;o that it appeared to have poi&s;oned it&s;elf as well as the puppy. The other in&s;tance he gave was concerning him&s;elf. He &s;aid that when he was a young man, he was very fond of the women, and at length got the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o that by following this propen&s;ity, he was led to injure him&s;elf and others. He &s;aid our happine&s;s depends on our u&s;ing our rea&s;on, in order to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e evil di&s;po&s;itions; but when our propen&s;ities nei|ther lead us to injure our&s;elves nor others, we might with &s;afe|ty indulge them, or even pur&s;u&s;e them as the means of happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Indians generally, are of opinion that there are great numbers of inferior Deities, which they call <HI>Carreyagaroona,</HI> which &s;ignifies the Heavenly Inhabitants. The&s;e beings they &s;uppo&s;e are employed as a&s;&s;i&s;tants, in managing the affairs of the
<PB N="81" REF="036317_0080_1008DC8DC44892A8">
univer&s;e, and in in&s;pecting the actions of men: and that even the irrational animals are engaged in viewing their actions, and bearing intelligence to the Gods. The eagle, for this purpo&s;e, with her keen eye, is &s;oaring about in the day, and the owl, with her nightly eye, perched on the trees around their camp in the night; therefore, when they ob&s;erve the eagle or the owl near, they immediately offer &s;acrifice, or burn tobacco, that they may have a good report to carry to the Gods. They &s;ay that there are al&s;o great numbers of evil &s;pirits, which they call <HI>Onasabroona,</HI> which &s;ignifies the Inhabiants of the Lower Region. The&s;e they &s;ay are employed in di&s;turbing the world, and the good &s;pirits are always going after them, and &s;etting things right, &s;o that they are con&s;tantly working in oppo&s;ition to each other. Some talk of a future &s;tate, but not with any certainty: at be&s;t their notions are vague and un&s;ettled. Oth|ers deny a future &s;tate altogether, and &s;ay that after death they neither think or live.</P>
<P>As the Caugnewagas and the &s;ix nations &s;peak nearly the &s;ame language, their theology is al&s;o nearly alike. When I met with the Shawanees or Delawares, as I could not &s;peak their tongue, I &s;poke Ottawa to them, and as it bore &s;ome re|&s;emblance to their language, we under&s;tood each other in &s;ome common affairs, but as I could only conver&s;e with them very imperfectly, I cannot from my own knowledge, with certainty, give any account of their theological opinions.</P>

<HEAD>ON THEIR POLICE, OR CIVIL GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I have often heard of Indian Kings, but never &s;aw any.&mdash; How any term u&s;ed by the Indians in their own tongue, for the chief man of a nation, could be rendered King, I know not. The chief of a nation is neither a &s;upreme ruler, monarch or potentate&mdash;He can neither make war or peace, leagues or treaties&mdash;He cannot impre&s;s &s;oldiers, or di&s;po&s;e of maga|zines&mdash;He cannot adjourn, prorogue or di&s;&s;olve a general a&s;&s;em|bly, nor can he refu&s;e his a&s;&s;ent to their conclu&s;ions, or in any manner controul them&mdash;With them there is no &s;uch thing as hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, title of nobility or royal blood, even talked of&mdash;The chief of a nation, even with the con&s;ent of his a&s;&s;em|bly, or council, cannot rai&s;e one &s;hilling of tax off the citizens, but only receive what they plea&s;e to give as free and voluntary donations&mdash;The chief of a nation has to hunt for his living, as any other citizen&mdash;How then can they with any propriety, be called kings? I apprehend that the white people were formerly &s;o fond of the name of kings, and &s;o ignorant of their power, that they concluded the chief man of a nation mu&s;t be a king.</P>
<P>As they are illiterate, they con&s;equently have no written

code of laws. What they execute as laws, are either old cu&s;|toms, or the immediate re&s;ult of new councils. Some of their ancient laws or cu&s;toms are very pernicious, and di&s;turb the public weal. Their vague law of marriage is a glaring in&s;tance of this, as the man and his wife are under no legal obligation to live together, if they are both willing to part. They have little form, or ceremony among them, in matrimony, but do like the I&s;raelites of old&mdash;the man goes in unto the woman, and &s;he becomes his wife. The years of puberty and the age of con&s;ent, is about fourteen for the women, and eighteen for the men. Before I was taken by the Indians, I had often heard that in the ceremony of marriage, the man gave the woman a deer's leg, and &s;he gave him a red ear of corn, &s;ignifying that &s;he was to keep him in bread, and he was to keep her in meat. I enquired of them concerning the truth of this, and they &s;aid they knew nothing of it, further than that they had heard it was the ancient cu&s;tom among &s;ome nations. Their frequent changing of partners prevents propagation, creates di&s;turban|ces, and often occa&s;ions murder and blood&s;hed; though this is commonly committed under the pretence of being drunk. Their impunity to crimes committed when intoxicated with &s;pirituous liquors, or their admitting one crime as an excu&s;e for another, is a very unju&s;t law or cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>The extremes they run into in dividing the necece&s;&s;aries of life, are hurtful to the public weal; though their dividing meat when hunting, may an&s;wer a valuable purpo&s;e, as one family may have &s;ucce&s;s one day, and the other the next; but their carrying this cu&s;tom to the town, or to agriculture, is &s;triking at the root of indu&s;try, as indu&s;trious per&s;ons ought to be re|warded, and the lazy &s;uffer for their indolence.</P>
<P>They have &s;carcely any penal laws: the principal puni&s;hment is degrading: even murder is not puni&s;hed by any formal law, only the friends of the murdered are at liberty to &s;lay the mur|derer, if &s;ome attonement is not made. Their not annexing penalties to their laws, is perhaps not as great a crime, or as unju&s;t and cruel, as the bloody penal laws of England, which we have &s;o long &s;hamefully practi&s;ed, and which are in force in this &s;tate, until our penitentiary hou&s;e is fini&s;hed, which is now building, and then they are to be repealed.</P>
<P>Let us al&s;o take a view of the advantages attending Indian police:&mdash;They are not oppre&s;&s;ed or perplexed with expen&s;ive litigation&mdash;They are not injured by legal robbery&mdash;They have no &s;plendid villains that make them&s;elves grand and great upon other peoples labor&mdash;They have neither church or &s;tate erected as money-making machines.</P>

<HEAD>ON THEIR DISCIPLINE, AND METHOD OF WAR.</HEAD>
<P>I have often heard the Briti&s;h officers call the Indians the undi&s;ciplined &s;avages, which is a capital mi&s;take&mdash;as they have all the e&s;&s;entials of di&s;cipline. They are under good com|mand, and punctual in obeying orders: they can act in concert, and when their officers lay a plan and give orders, they will chearfully unite in putting all their directions into immediate execution; and by each man ob&s;erving the motion or move|ment of his right hand companion, they can communicate the motion from right to left, and march a-brea&s;t in concert, and in &s;cattered order, though the line may be more than a mile long, and continue, if occa&s;ion requires, for a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance, without di&s;order or confu&s;ion. They can perform va|rious nece&s;&s;ary manoeuvres, either &s;lowly, or as fa&s;t as they can run: they can form a circle, or &s;emi-circle: the circle they make u&s;e of, in order to &s;urround their enemy, and the &s;emi-cir|cle if the enemy has a river on one &s;ide of them. They can al&s;o form a large hollow &s;quare, face out and take trees: this they do, if their enemies are about &s;urrounding them, to pre|vent being &s;hot from either &s;ide of the tree. When they go into battle they are not loaded or encumbered with many clothes, as they commonly fight naked, &s;ave only breech-clout, leggins and mocke&s;ons. There is no &s;uch thing as corporeal puni&s;hment u&s;ed, in order to bring them under &s;uch good di&s;ci|pline: degrading is the only cha&s;ti&s;ement, and they are &s;o una|nimous in this, that it effectually an&s;wers the purpo&s;e. Their officers plan, order and conduct matters until they are brought into action, and then each man is to fight as though he was to gain the battle him&s;elf. General orders are commonly given in time of battle, either to advance or retreat, and is done by a &s;hout or yell, which is well under&s;tood, and then they retreat or advance in concert. They are generally well equipped, and exceeding expert and active in the u&s;e of arms. Could it be &s;uppo&s;ed that undi&s;ciplined troops could defeat Generals Brad|dock, Grant, &amp;c? It may be &s;aid by &s;ome that the French were al&s;o engaged in this war: true, they were; yet I know it was the Indians that laid the plan, and with &s;mall a&s;&s;i&s;tance, put it into execution. The Indians had no aid from the French, or any other power, when they be&s;ieged Fort Pitt in the year 1763, and cut off the communication for a con&s;iderable time, between that po&s;t and Fort Loudon, and would have defeated General Bouquet's army, (who were on the way to rai&s;e the &s;iege) had it not been for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Virginia volun|teers. They had no Briti&s;h troops with them when they de|feated Colonel Crawford, near the Sandu&s;ky, in the time of the American War with Great Britain; or when they defeated
<PB N="84" REF="036317_0083_1008DC9744836928">
Colonel Loughrie, on the Ohio, near the Miami, on his way to meet General Clarke: this was al&s;o in the time of the Bri|ti&s;h war. It was the Indians alone that defeated Colonel Todd, in Kentucky, near the Blue licks&punc; in the year 1782; and Colonel Harmer, betwixt the Ohio and Lake Erie, in the year 1790, and General St. Clair, in the year 1791; and it is &s;aid that there were more of our men killed at this defeat, than there were in any one battle during our conte&s;t with Great Britain. They had no aid when they fought even the Virginia rifle-men almo&s;t a whole day, at the Great Kanhawa, in the year 1774; and when they found they could not prevail again&s;t the Virginians, they made a mo&s;t artful retreat. Notwith&s;tand|ing they had the Ohio to cro&s;s, &s;ome continued firing, whil&s;t others were cro&s;&s;ing the river; in this manner they proceeded until they all got over, before the Virginians knew that they had retreated; and in this retreat they carried off all their wounded. In the mo&s;t of the foregoing defeats, they fought with an inferior number, though in this, I believe it was not the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more unju&s;tly repre&s;ented than the different accounts we have had of their number from time to time, both by their own computations, and that of the Briti&s;h. While I was among them, I &s;aw the account of the number, that they in tho&s;e parts gave to the French, and kept it by me. When they in their own council-hou&s;e, were taking an account of their number, with a piece of bark newly &s;tripped, and a &s;mall &s;tick, which an&s;wered the end of a &s;late and pencil, I took an account of the different nations and tribes, which I added to|gether, and found there were not half the number which they had given the French: and though they were then their allies, and lived among them, it was not ea&s;y finding out the decep|tion, as they were a wandering &s;et, and &s;ome of them almo&s;t al|ways in the woods hunting. I a&s;ked one of the chiefs what was their rea&s;on for making &s;uch different returns? He &s;aid it was for political rea&s;ons, in order to obtain greater pre&s;ents from the French, by telling them they could not divide &s;uch and &s;uch quantities of goods among &s;o many.</P>
<P>In year of General Bouquet's la&s;t campaign, 1764, I &s;aw the official return made by the Briti&s;h officers, of the number of Indians that were in arms again&s;t us that year, which amount|ed to thirty thou&s;and. As I was then a lieutenant in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, I told them I was of opinion that there was not above one thou&s;and in arms again&s;t us, as they were divided by Broad-&s;treet's army being then at Lake Erie. The Briti&s;h officers hooted at me, and &s;aid they could not make England &s;en&s;ible of the difficulties they labored under in fighting them, as England expect that their troops could fight the undi&s;ciplined &s;avages
<PB N="85" REF="036317_0084_1008DC98DE889AC8">
in America, five to one, as they did the Ea&s;t-Indians, and therefore my report would not an&s;wer their purpo&s;e, as they could not give an honorable account of the war, but by aug|menting their number. I am of opinion that from Braddock's war, until the pre&s;ent time, there never were more than three thou&s;and Indians at any time, in arms again&s;t us, we&s;t of Fort Pitt, and frequently not half that number. According to the Indians' own accounts, during the whole of Braddock's war, or from 1755, till 1758, they killed or took, fifty of our peo|ple, for one that they lo&s;t. In the war that commenced in the year 1763, they killed, comparatively, few of our people, and lo&s;t more of theirs, as the frontiers (e&s;pecially the Virginians) had learned &s;omething of their method of war: yet, they, in this war, according to their own accounts, (which I believe to be true) killed or took ten of our people, for one they lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Let us now take a view of the blood and trea&s;ure that was &s;pent in oppo&s;ing comparatively, a few Indian warriors, with only &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the French, the fir&s;t four years of the war. Additional to the amazing de&s;truction and &s;laughter that the frontiers &s;u&s;tained, from James River to Su&s;quehanna, and about thirty miles broad; the following campaigns were al&s;o carried on again&s;t the Indians:&mdash;General Braddock's, in the year 1755: Colonel Arm&s;trong's again&s;t the Cattanyan town, on the Allegheny, 1757: General Forbes's, in 1758: General Stanwick's, in 1759: General Monkton's, in 1760: Colo|nel Bouquet's, in 1761&mdash;and 1763, when he fought the battle of Bru&s;hy Run, and lo&s;t above one hundred men; but by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the Virginia volunteers, drove the Indians: Colonel Arm&s;trong's, up the We&s;t Branch of Su&s;quehanna, in 1763: General Broad&s;treet's, up Lake Erie, in 1764: General Bou|quet's, again&s;t the Indians at Mu&s;kingum, in 1764: Lord Dun|more's, in 1774: General M'Into&s;h's, in 1778: Colonel Crawford's, &s;hortly after his, General Clarke's, in 1778&mdash;1780: Colonel Bowman's, in 1779: General Clarke's, in 1782&mdash;again&s;t the Waba&s;h, in 1786: General Logan's again&s;t the Shawanees, in 1786: General Wilkin&s;on's, in&mdash;: Colonel Harmer's, in 1790: and General St. Clair's in 1791; which, in all, are twenty-two campaigns, be&s;ide &s;maller expeditions, &s;uch as the French Creek expedition, Colonels Edwards's, Loughric's, &amp;c. All the&s;e were exclu&s;ive of the number of men that were inter|nally employed as &s;couting parties, and in erecting forts, guard|ing &s;tations, &amp;c. When we take the foregoing occurrences into con&s;ideration, may we not rea&s;onably conclude, that they are the be&s;t di&s;ciplined troops in the known world? Is it not the be&s;t di&s;cipline that has the greate&s;t tendency to annoy the ene|my and &s;ave their own men? I apprehend that the Indian di&s;|cipline
<PB N="86" REF="036317_0085_1008DC9C50466D78">
is as well calculated to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e in the woods of America, as the Briti&s;h di&s;cipline in Flanders: and Briti&s;h di&s;cipline, in the woods, is the way to have men &s;laughtered, with &s;carcely any chance of defending them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Let us take a view of the benefits we have received, by what little we have learned of their art of war, which co&s;t us dear, and the lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;tained for want of it, and then &s;ee if it will not be well worth our while to retain what we have, and al&s;o to endeavor to improve in this nece&s;&s;ary branch of bu&s;i|ne&s;s. Though we have made con&s;iderable proficiency in this line, and in &s;ome re&s;pects out-do them, <HI>viz.</HI> as mark&s;men, and in cutting our rifles, and keeping them in good order; yet, I apprehend we are far behind in their manoeuvres, or in being able to &s;urprize, or prevent a &s;urprize. May we not conclude that the progre&s;s we had made in their art of war, contributed con&s;iderably towards our &s;ucce&s;s, in various re&s;pects, when contending with great Britain for liberty? Had the Briti&s;h king attempted to en&s;lave us before Braddock's war, in all pro|bability he might readily have done it, becau&s;e, except the New-Englanders, who had formerly been engaged in war, with the Indians, we were unacquainted with any kind of war: but after fighting &s;uch a &s;ubtil and barbarous enemy as the Indians, we were not terrified at the approach of Briti&s;h red-coats.&mdash; Was not Burgoyne's defeat accompli&s;hed in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by the Indian mode of fighting? and did not Gen. Morgan's rifle-men, and many others, fight with greater &s;ucce&s;s, in con&s;equence of what they had learned of their art of war? Kentucky would not have been &s;ettled at the time it was, had the Virginians been altogether ignorant of this method of war.</P>
<P>In Braddock's war, the frontiers were laid wa&s;te, for above three hundred miles long, and generally about thirty broad, ex|cepting &s;ome that were living in forts, and many hundreds, or perhaps thou&s;ands, killed or made captives, and hor&s;es, and all kinds of property carried off: but, in the next Indian war, though we had the &s;ame Indians to cope with, the frontiers al|mo&s;t all &s;tood their ground, becau&s;e they were by this time, in &s;ome mea&s;ure acquainted with their manoeuvres; and the want of this, in the fir&s;t war, was the cau&s;e of the lo&s;s of many hundred of our citizens, and much trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Though large volumes have been wrote on morality, yet it may be all &s;ummed up in &s;aying, do as you would wi&s;h to be done by: &s;o the Indians &s;um up the art of war in the following manner:</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the private warriors is to be under command, or punctually to obey orders&mdash;to learn to march a-brea&s;t in &s;cattered order, &s;o as to be in readine&s;s to &s;urround the enemy,
<PB N="87" REF="036317_0086_1008DCA0984F9A30">
or to prevent being &s;urrounded&mdash;to be good mark&s;men, and active in the u&s;e of arms&mdash;to practice running&mdash;to learn <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">dure hunger or hard&s;hips with patience and fortitude&mdash;t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the truth at all times to their officers, but more e&s;pecially when &s;ent out to &s;py the enemy.</P>
<P><HI>Concerning Officers.</HI> They &s;ay that it would be ab&s;urd to appoint a man an officer who&s;e &s;kill and courage had never been tried&mdash;that all officers &s;hould be advanced only according to merit&mdash;that no one man &s;hould have the ab&s;olute command of an army&mdash;that a council of officers are to determine when, and how an attack is to be made&mdash;that it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the offi|cers to lay plans to take every advantage of the enemy&mdash;to am|bu&s;h and &s;urprize them, and to prevent being ambu&s;hed and &s;urprized them&s;elves&mdash;it is the duty of officers to prepare and deliver &s;peeches to the men, in order to annimate and encourage them; and on the march, to prevent the men, at any time, from getting into a huddle, becau&s;e if the enemy &s;hould &s;urround them in this po&s;ition, they would be expo&s;ed to the enemy's fire. It is likewi&s;e their bu&s;ine&s;s at all times to endeavor to annoy their enemy, and &s;ave their own men, and therefore ought never to bring on an attack without con&s;iderable advantage, or with|out what appeared to them the &s;ure pro&s;pect of victory, and that with the lo&s;s of few men: and if at any time they &s;hould be mi&s;taken in this, and are like to lo&s;e many men by gaining the victory, it is their duty to retreat, and wait for a better opportunity of defeating their enemy, without the danger of lo&s;ing &s;o many men. Their conduct proves that they act upon the&s;e principles, therefore it is, that from Braddock's war to the pre&s;ent time, they have &s;eldom ever made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attack. The battle at the mouth of the Great Kanhawa, is the greate&s;t in&s;tance of this; and even then, though the Indi|ans killed about three, for one they lo&s;t, yet they retreated. The lo&s;s of the Virginians in this action, was &s;eventy killed, and the &s;ame number wounded:&mdash;The Indians lo&s;t twenty kill|ed on the field, and eight, who died afterwards, of their wounds. This was the greate&s;t lo&s;s of men that I ever knew the Indians to &s;u&s;tain in any one battle. They will commonly retreat if their men are falling fa&s;t&mdash;they will not &s;tand cut|ting, like the Highlanders, or other Briti&s;h troops: but this proceeds from a compliance with their rules of war, rather than cowardice. If they are &s;urrounded, they will fight while there is a man of them alive, rather than &s;urrender. When Colonel John Arm&s;trong &s;urrounded the Cattanyan town, on the Alle|gheny river, Captain Jacobs, a Delaware chief, with &s;ome war|riors, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hou&s;e, defended them&s;elves for &s;ome time, and killed a number of our men. As Jacobs could &s;peak
<PB N="88" REF="036317_0087_1008DCA3749A4F00">
Engli&s;h&punc; our people called on him to &s;urrender: he &s;aid that he and his men were warriors, and they would all fight while life remained. He was again told that they &s;hould be well u&s;ed, if they would only &s;urrender; and if not, the hou&s;e &s;hould be burned down over their heads:&mdash;Jacobs replied he could eat fire: and when the hou&s;e was in a flame, he, and they that were with him, came out in a fighting po&s;ition, and were all killed. As they are a &s;harp, active kind of people, and war is their prin|cipal &s;tudy, in this they have arrived at con&s;iderable perfection. We may learn of the Indians what is u&s;eful and laudable, and at the &s;ame time lay a&s;ide their barbarous proceedings. It is much to be lamented that &s;ome of our frontier rifle-men are prone to imitate them in their inhumanity. During the Briti&s;h war, a con&s;iderable number of men from below Fort Pitt, cro&s;&s;|ed the Ohio, and marched into a town of Friendly Indians, chiefly Delawares, who profe&s;&s;ed the Moravian religion. As the Indians apprehended no danger, they neither lifted arms or fled. After the&s;e rifle-men were &s;ometime in the town, and the Indians altogether in their power, in cool blood, they ma&s;&s;acred the whole town, without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex. This was an act of barbarity beyond any thing I ever knew to be commit|ted by the &s;avages them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Why have we not made greater proficiency in the Indian art of war? Is it becau&s;e we are too proud to imitate them, even though it &s;hould be a means of pre&s;erving the lives of many of our citizens? No! We are not above borrowing lan|guage from them, &s;uch as homony, pone, tomahawk, &amp;c. which is of little or no u&s;e to us. I apprehend that the rea&s;ons why we have not improved more in this re&s;pect, are as follows: no important acqui&s;ition is to be obtained but by attention and diligence; and as it is ea&s;ier to learn to move and act in con|cert, in clo&s;e order, in the open plain, than to act in concert in &s;cattered order, in the woods; &s;o it is ea&s;ier to learn our di&s;ci|pline, than the Indian manoeuvres. They train up their boys to the art of war from the time they are twelve or fourteen years of age; whereas the principal chance our people had of learning, was by ob&s;erving their movements when in action again&s;t us. I have been long a&s;toni&s;hed that no one has wrote upon this important &s;ubject, as their art of war would not only be of u&s;e to us in ca&s;e of another rupture with them; but were only part of our men taught this art, accompanied with our con|tinental di&s;cipline, I think no European power, after trial, would venture to &s;hew its head in the American woods.</P>
<P>If what I have wrote &s;hould meet the approbation of my coun|trymen, perhaps I may publi&s;h more upon this &s;ubject, in a fu|ture edition.</P>
