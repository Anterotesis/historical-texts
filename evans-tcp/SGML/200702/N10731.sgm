<HEAD>FREE THOUGHTS, ON The PROCEEDINGS of THE Congre&s;s <HI>at</HI> Philadelphia, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends and Countrymen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me to addre&s;s you upon a &s;ubject, which, next to your eternal welfare in a future world, demands your mo&s;t &s;erious and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate con&s;ideration. The American Colonies are unhappily involved in a &s;cene of confu&s;ion and di&s;cord. The bands of civil &s;ociety are broken; the authority of government weakened, and in &s;ome in&s;tances taken away: Individuals are deprived of their liberty; their property is fre|quently invaded by violence, and not a &s;ingle Magi&s;trate has had courage or virtue enough to interpo&s;e. From this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation it was hoped, that the wi&s;dom and prudence of the Congre&s;s lately a&s;&s;embled at Philadelphia, would have delivered us. The eyes of all men were turned to them. We ardently expected that &s;ome prudent &s;cheme of accommodating our un|happy di&s;putes with the Mother-Country, would have been adopted and pur&s;ued. But alas! they are broken up without ever attempting it: they have taken no one &s;tep that tended to peace: they have gone on from bad to wor&s;e, and have either ignorantly mi&s;under&s;tood, carele&s;sly neglected, or ba&s;ely betray|ed the intere&s;ts of all the Colonies.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="013602_0003_0F95A68B923D7AB8">I &s;hall in this, and &s;ome future publication, &s;upport this charge again&s;t the Congre&s;s, by inconte&s;tible facts: But my fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be to point out to you &s;ome of the con&s;equences that will probably follow from the Non-importation, Non|exportation, and Non-con&s;umption Agreements, which they have adopted, and which they have ordered to be enforced in the mo&s;t arbitrary manner, and under the &s;evere&s;t penalties. On this &s;ubject, I choo&s;e to addre&s;s my&s;elf principally to You the <HI>Farmers</HI> of the Province of New-York, becau&s;e I am mo&s;t nearly connected with you, being one of your number, and having no intere&s;t in the country but in common with you; and al&s;o, be|cau&s;e the intere&s;t of the farmers in general will be more &s;en&s;ibly affected, and more deeply injured by the&s;e agreements, than the intere&s;t of any other body of people on the continent. Another rea&s;on why I choo&s;e to addre&s;s my&s;elf to you is, becau&s;e the Farmers are of the greate&s;t benefit to the &s;tate, of any people in it: They furni&s;h food for the merchant, and mechanic; the raw materials for mo&s;t manufactures, the &s;taple exports of the country, are the produce of their indu&s;try: be then convinced of your own importance, and think and act accordingly.</P>
<P>The Non-importation Agreement adopted by the Congre&s;s is to take place the fir&s;t day of December next; after which no goods, wares, or merchandize, are to be imported from Great|Britain or Ireland; no Ea&s;t-India Tea from any part of the world; no mola&s;&s;es, &s;yrups, paneles, coffee, or pimento, from our i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies; no wine from Madeira, or the We&s;tern-I&s;lands; no foreign indigo.</P>
<P>The Non-Exportation Agreement is to take effect on the tenth day of September next; after which we are not to export, directly or indirectly, any merchandize or commodity what&s;oever to Great-Britain, Ireland, or the We&s;t-Indies, except RICE to Eu|rope,&mdash;unle&s;s the &s;everal acts and parts of acts of the Briti&s;h Parliament, referred to by the fourth article of A&s;&s;ociation, be repealed.</P>
<P>The Non-con&s;umption Agreement is to be in force the fir&s;t day of March next; after which we are not to purcha&s;e or u&s;e any Ea&s;t-India Tea what&s;oever; nor any goods, wares, or mer|chandize from Great-Britain or Ireland, imported after the fir&s;t of December, nor mola&s;&s;es, &amp;c. from the We&s;t-Indies; nor wine from Madeira, or the We&s;tern I&s;lands, nor foreign indigo.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="013602_0004_0F95A68C4B26EF48">Let us now con&s;ider the probable con&s;equences of the&s;e agree|ments, &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hould take place, and be exactly adhered to. The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention is, clamours, di&s;cord, confu&s;ion, mobs, riots, in&s;urrections, rebellions, in Great-Britain, Ireland, and the We&s;t-Indies. This con&s;equence does not indeed imme|diately affect You, the Farmers of New-York; nor do I think it a probable one: But the Congre&s;s certainly intended it &s;hould happen in &s;ome degree, or the effect they propo&s;e from the&s;e agree|ments cannot po&s;&s;ibly take place. They intend to di&s;tre&s;s the manufacturers in Great-Britain, by depriving them of employ|ment&mdash; to di&s;tre&s;s the inhabitants of Ireland, by depriving them of flax-&s;eed, and of a vent for their linens,&mdash;to di&s;tre&s;s the We&s;t-India people, by with-holding provi&s;ions and lumber from them, and by &s;topping the market for their produce. And they hope, by the&s;e means, to force them all to join their clamours with ours, to get the acts complained of, repealed. This was the undoubted de&s;ign of the Congre&s;s when the&s;e agreements were framed; and this is the avowed de&s;ign of their warm &s;upporters and partizans, in common conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>But where is the ju&s;tice, where is the policy of this proceedure? The manufacturers of Great-Britain, the inhabitants of Ireland, and of the We&s;t-Indies, have done us no injury. They have been no ways in&s;trumental in bringing our di&s;tre&s;&s;es upon us. Shall we then revenge our&s;elves upon them? Shall we endeavour to &s;tarve them into a compliance with our humours? Shall we, without any provocation, tempt or force them into riots and in&s;urrections which mu&s;t be attended with the ruin of many&mdash; probably with the death of &s;ome of them? Shall we attempt to un&s;ettle the whole Briti&s;h Government&mdash;to throw all into con|fu&s;ion, becau&s;e our &s;elf-will is not complied with? Becau&s;e the ill-projected, ill-conducted, abominable &s;cheme of &s;ome of the coloni&s;ts, to form a republican government independent of Great-Britain, cannot otherwi&s;e &s;ucceed?&mdash;Good God! can we look forward to the ruin, de&s;truction, and de&s;olation of the whole Briti&s;h Empire, without one relenting thought? Can we contemplate it with plea&s;ure; and promote it with all our might and vigour, and at the &s;ame time call our&s;elves <HI>his Ma|je&s;ty's mo&s;t dutiful and loyal &s;ubjects?</HI> Whatever the Gentlemen of the Congre&s;s may think of the matter, the &s;pirit that dictated &s;uch a mea&s;ure, was not the &s;pirit of humanity.</P>
<P>Next let us con&s;ider the policy, or rather impolicy of this mea&s;ure. In&s;tead of conciliating, it will alienate the affections of the people of Great-Britain. Of friends it will make them our
<PB N="6" REF="013602_0005_0F95A6922DDA7AC8">
enemies; it will excite the re&s;entment of the government at home again&s;t us; and their re&s;entment will do us no good, but, on the contrary, much harm.</P>
<P>Can we think to threaten, and bully, and frighten the &s;upreme government of the nation into a compliance with our demands? Can we expect to force a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to our peevi&s;h and petulant humours, by exciting clamors and riots in England? We ought to know the temper and &s;pirit, the power and &s;trength of the nation better. A &s;ingle campaign, &s;hould &s;he exert her force, would ruin us effectually. But &s;hould &s;he choo&s;e le&s;s violent means, &s;he has it in her power to humble us without hurting her&s;elf. She might rai&s;e immen&s;e revenues, by laying duties in England, Ireland and the We&s;t-Indies, and we could have no remedy left; for this non-importation &s;cheme cannot la&s;t forever. She can embarra&s;s our trade in the Mediterranean with Spain, Holland &amp;c. nor can we help our&s;elves; for what|ever regulations &s;he &s;hould make, would effectually be enforced, by the &s;ame Navy that &s;he keeps in readine&s;s to protect her own trade.</P>
<P>We &s;hall al&s;o, probably, rai&s;e the re&s;entment of the Iri&s;h and We&s;t-Indians. The pa&s;&s;ions of human nature are much the &s;ame in all countries. If they find us di&s;po&s;ed wantonly to di&s;tre&s;s them, to &s;erve our own purpo&s;es, will they not look out for &s;ome method to do without us? Will they not &s;eek el&s;e-where for a &s;upply of tho&s;e articles, which they u&s;ed to take from us? They would de&s;erve to be de&s;pi&s;ed for their meanne&s;s, did they not.</P>
<P>Holland, the Baltic, and the river St. Lawrence, would afford the Iri&s;h a &s;ufficient &s;upply of flax-&s;eed. If they look out in time they cannot be di&s;appointed. Canada produces no in|con&s;iderable quantity already.&mdash;</P>
<P>I have been well informed, that many bu&s;hels have been bought up there at a low price, brought to New-York, and &s;old to the Iri&s;h factors at a great advance. Are the Iri&s;h &s;uch novices in navigation, that they cannot find the way to Quebec? Or are they &s;o blind to their own intere&s;t, as to continue giving a high price for flax-&s;eed at New-York, when they might have a con&s;iderable &s;upply from Canada, at a much more rea&s;onable rate?</P>
<P>You will &s;ay that as &s;oon as the Iri&s;h &s;end their &s;hips to Que|bec for &s;eed, the price will ri&s;e till it comes to an equality with ours. I know it. I know al&s;o, that the more the price ri&s;es,
<PB N="7" REF="013602_0006_0F95A6925EECA428">
the more Canadians will be encouraged to rai&s;e it. I know al&s;o, that the more they rai&s;e and &s;ell, the le&s;s demand there will be for ours, and the le&s;s price it will fetch at market.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould we di&s;tre&s;s the inhabitants of the We&s;t-Indies &s;o much as at fir&s;t &s;ight we may imagine. Tho&s;e i&s;lands produce now many of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. The quantity may ea&s;ily be encrea&s;ed. Canada would furni&s;h them with many articles they now take from us; flour, lumber, hor&s;es, &amp;c. Georgia, the Floridas, and the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi abound in lumber; Nova-Sco|tia in fi&s;h. All the&s;e countries would be enriched by our folly, and would laugh at it.</P>
<P>When a trading people carele&s;ly neglect, or wilfully give up any branch of their trade, it is &s;eldom in their power to recover it. Should the Iri&s;h turn their trade for flax-&s;eed to Quebec; and the We&s;t-Indians get their flour, hor&s;es, &amp;c. from thence, or other places; the lo&s;s to the farmers of this province would be immen&s;e. The la&s;t non-importation &s;cheme turned the Indian trade from New-York down the river St. Lawrence; we are now repeating, with regard to our flour and flax-&s;eed, the &s;ame blun|der we then committed with regard to the Indian trade. The con&s;equence, however, will be much wor&s;e. The lo&s;s of the Indian trade, was a lo&s;s to the merchants only; but the lo&s;s of the flax-&s;eed trade, will be a lo&s;s to every farmer in the province; and a lo&s;s which he will &s;everely feel.</P>
<P>You know, my Friends, that the &s;ale of your &s;eed not only pays your taxes, but furni&s;hes you with many of the little con|veniencies, and comforts of life; the lo&s;s of it for one year would be of more damage to you, than paying the three-penny duty on tea for twenty. Let us compare matters a little. It was in|convenient for me this year to &s;ow more than one bu&s;hel of &s;eed. I have thre&s;hed and cleaned up eleven bu&s;hels. The common price now is at lea&s;t ten &s;hillings;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since this piece was written, the price of flax-&s;eed is ri&s;en to thirteen &s;hillings per bu&s;hel.</NOTE> my &s;eed then will fetch me five pounds, ten &s;hillings. But I will throw in the ten &s;hillings for expences. There remain five pounds: in five pounds are four hundred three-pences; four hundred three-pences currency, will pay the duty upon two hundred pounds of tea, even reckon|ing the exchange with London at 200 per cent, that is, rec|koning 100l. &s;terling, to be equal to 200l. currency; whereas in fact it is only equal to 175 or 180l. at the mo&s;t, I u&s;e in my family about &s;ix pounds of tea: few farmers in my neighbourhood
<PB N="8" REF="013602_0007_0F95A69378914AF0">
u&s;e &s;o much: but I hate to &s;tint my wife and daughters, or my friendly neighub wsrohen they come to &s;ee me. Be&s;ides, I like a di&s;h of tea too, e&s;pecially after a little more than ordinary fa|tigue in hot weather. Now 200 pounds of tea, at &s;ix pounds a year, will la&s;t ju&s;t 33 years, and eight months. So that in order to pay this mon&s;trous duty upon tea, which has rai&s;ed all this confounded combu&s;tion in the country, I have only to &s;ell the produce of a bu&s;hel of flax-&s;eed once in THIRTY-THREE years. Ridiculous!</P>
<P>But, to leave je&s;ting. The lo&s;s of the &s;ale of your &s;eed only for one year, would be a con&s;iderable damage to you. And yet the Congre&s;s have been &s;o inattentive to your intere&s;t, that they have laid you under, almo&s;t, an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of lo&s;ing it the next year. They have decreed, and proclaimed a non-exportation, to commence in September next. The Iri&s;h will be alarmed. They will look out &s;omewhere el&s;e. Or &s;hould they determine to &s;end their &s;hips the earlier, we cannot, without the utmo&s;t inconveni|ence, get our &s;eed to market by that time; e&s;pecially, not from the remoter parts of the province. The con&s;equence will be, that we mu&s;t &s;ell our &s;eed at the oil-mills in New-York, ju&s;t at the price the manufacturers &s;hall plea&s;e to give us.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, it is highly improbable that we &s;hall &s;ucceed in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the people of Great Britain, Ireland, and the We&s;t-Indies, &s;o far as to oblige them to join with us in getting the acts of Parliament which we complain of, repealed. The fir&s;t di&s;tre&s;s will fall on our&s;elves: it will be more &s;everely felt by us, than by any part of all his Maje&s;ty's dominions; and it will affect us the longe&s;t. The fleets of Great-Britain com|mand re&s;pect throughout the globe. Her influence extends to every part of the earth. Her manufactures are equal to any, &s;uperior to mo&s;t in the world. Her wealth is great. Her people enterprising, and per&s;evering in their attempts to extend and enlarge and protect her trade. The total lo&s;s of our trade would be felt only for a time. Her merchants would turn their atten|tion another way. New &s;ources of trade and wealth would be opened: New &s;chemes pur&s;ued. She would &s;oon find a vent for all her manufactures in &s;pite of all we could do. Our malice would hurt our&s;elves only. Should our &s;chemes di&s;tre&s;s &s;ome branches of her trade, it could be only for a time; and there is ability and humanity enough in the nation to relieve tho&s;e that are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by us, and to put them in &s;ome other way of getting their living.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013602_0008_0F95A693CEE9BFC0">The ca&s;e is very different with <HI>us.</HI> We have no trade but un|der the protection of Great-Britain. We can trade no where but where &s;he plea&s;es. We have no influence abroad, no amba&s;&s;a|dors, no con&s;uls, no fleet to protect our &s;hips in pa&s;&s;ing the &s;eas, nor our merchants and people in foreign countries. Should our mad &s;chemes take place, our &s;ailors, &s;hip-carpenters, carmen, &s;ail-makers, riggers, miners, &s;melters, forge-men, and workers in bar-iron, &amp;c. would be immediately out of employ; and we &s;hould have twenty mobs and riots in our own country, before one would happen in Britain or Ireland. Want of food will make the&s;e people mad, and they will come in troops upon our farms, and take that by force which they have not money to purcha&s;e. And who could blame them? Ju&s;tice, indeed, might hang them; but the &s;ympathetic eye would drop the tear of humanity on their grave.</P>
<P>The next thing I &s;hall take notice of, is the advanced prices of goods, which will, not only probably, but nece&s;&s;arily, follow, as &s;oon as the non-importation from Great Britain, &amp;c. &s;hall take effect. This is a con&s;equence that mo&s;t nearly concerns you; nor can you prevent it. You are obliged to buy many articles of clothing. You cannot make them your&s;elves; or you cannot make them &s;o cheap as you can buy them. You want Woollens for your winter clothing. Few of you have wool enough to an|&s;wer the purpo&s;e. For notwith&s;tanding the boa&s;ts of &s;ome igno|rant, hot-headed men, there is not wool enough on the continent, taking all the colonies together, to &s;upply the inhabitants with &s;tockings. Notwith&s;tanding all the home-&s;pun you can make, many of you find it difficult, at the year's end, to pay the &s;hop|keeper for what the nece&s;&s;ities of your families have obliged you to take up. What will you do when the prices of goods are ad|vanced a quarter, for in&s;tance, or an half? To &s;ay that the prices of goods will not be rai&s;ed, betrays your ignorance and folly. The price of any commodity always ri&s;es in proportion to the de|mand for it; and the demand always increa&s;es in proportion to its &s;carcity. As &s;oon as the importation cea&s;es in New-York, the quantity of goods will be daily le&s;&s;ened, by daily con&s;ump|tion; and tne prices will gradually ri&s;e in proportion. "But the merchants of New-York have declared that, they will demand only a rea&s;onable profit." Who is to judge what a rea&s;onable profit is? Why, the merchants. Will they expo&s;e their invoices, and the &s;ecrets of their trade to you, that you may judge whe|ther their profits are rea&s;onable or not? Certainly they will not. and if they did, you cannot under&s;tand them; and, con&s;e|quently, can form no judgment about them. You have there|fore
<PB N="10" REF="013602_0009_0F95A6948B710420">
nothing to tru&s;t to in this ca&s;e but the honour of the mer|chants. Let us then con&s;ider how far we have rea&s;on to tru&s;t to their honour.</P>
<P>Not to rai&s;e the price of a commodity when it is &s;carce, and in demand, is contrary to the principles and practice of merchants. Their maxim is, to buy as cheap, and &s;ell as dear, as they can. Will they let you have a piece of goods for twenty &s;hillings, which will fetch them twenty-five? When the &s;tores and &s;hops are full, and a price is demanded which you think unrea&s;onable, you will a&s;k an abatement. If you are refu&s;ed, you will look el&s;ewhere. But when there are few goods and many buyers, no abatement can be expected. If you won't give the price, your neighbour perhaps is in greater nece&s;&s;ity, and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> give it. Be|&s;ides, the merchant knows that no more goods can be imported. He knows that the nece&s;&s;ities of the country are increa&s;ing, and that what you refu&s;e now at twenty &s;hillings, you will be obliged to take, by and by, at twenty five.</P>
<P>But no argument is like matter of fact. You have had one trial of a non-importation agreement &s;ome years ago. Pray how did you like it? Were the prices of goods rai&s;ed on you then? You know they were. What remedy had you? A good Chri&s;tian remedy indeed, but a hard one&mdash;patience&mdash;and patience only: The honour of the merchants gave you no relief&mdash;confound their honour&mdash;it obliged me&mdash;it obliged many of you, to take old moth-eaten cloths that had lain rotting in the &s;hops for years, and to pay a mon&s;trous price for them.</P>
<P>Some, indeed, I confe&s;s it with gratitude, had honour enough to attempt to regulate the price of Tea, at that time. Did they &s;ucceed? No. There was not honour enough in the body of merchants to bring it to effect. Me&s;&s;rs.  <GAP DESC="blank">  declared at the Coffee-Hou&s;e, that they would be bound by no regulations. They would have their own price for their tea. They had it. And common bo|hea tea was &s;old at the enormous price of nine &s;hillings the pound. Will you again tru&s;t to the honour of the&s;e men? You had better tru&s;t to the mercy of a Turk.</P>
<P>Indulge me in a few &s;entences more upon this &s;ame &s;ubject of Tea. It is well known that little or no tea has been entered at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e for &s;everal years. All that is imported is &s;muggled from Holland, and the Dutch I&s;land in the We&s;t-In|dies. In this trade the laws of our country are trampled upon.
<PB N="11" REF="013602_0010_0F95A6958A6B4C20">
The nation is defrauded of its revenues. The &s;acredne&s;s of an oath, the grand &s;ecurity of the liberty, and property, and lives of Engli&s;hmen, is pro&s;tituted to the vile purpo&s;es of private gain. Perjury, and fal&s;e-&s;wearing are encouraged by tho&s;e very mer|chants, to who&s;e honour we are now to tru&s;t, that they will not demand an unrea&s;onable profit on their goods.</P>
<P>Let the guilty alone take this to them&s;elves. I mean no re|flections on the fair-trader. But never will I believe that the man who can cooly and deliberately encourage perjury or fal&s;e-&s;wearing&mdash;who can calmly lay &s;chemes, and repeatedly execute them, in order to defraud his country of her revenues, would ever he&s;itate one moment, whether he &s;hould not pro&s;titute his honour, and cheat me too, could he do it with equal &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The poor culprit, who, perhaps forced by nece&s;&s;ity, turns in|former, is branded with ignominy&mdash;is treated as an out-ca&s;t from &s;ociety: But the lordly merchant, who, wallowing in wealth, can plead no nece&s;&s;ity, tramples on the mo&s;t &s;acred ob|ligations, and yet holds up his head, and boa&s;ts him&s;elf a man of honour. O Shame! Shame! Shame!</P>
<P>I know not how it happens, but not only the merchants, but the generality of citizens, treat us <HI>countrymen</HI> with very unde|&s;erved contempt. They act as though they thought, that all wi&s;dom, all knowledge, all under&s;tanding and &s;en&s;e, centered in them&s;elves, and that we farmers were utterly ignorant of every thing, but ju&s;t to drive our oxen, and to follow the plough. We are never con&s;ulted, but when they cannot do without us. And then, all the plans are laid in the City before they are offered to us. Be the potion they prepare for us ever &s;o nau&s;eous, we mu&s;t &s;wallow it down, as well as we can. It is not many years &s;ince the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty of the city, &s;hewed their contempt of us, in the mo&s;t in&s;ulting manner. They pa&s;&s;ed a law to regulate the prices of our produce; and in&s;tead of pro|tecting us in their markets, we were expo&s;ed to continual abu&s;e and in&s;ults. We could not carry a quart of milk, a duck, a chicken,&mdash;I think not an egg,&mdash;I am &s;ure not a quail or <HI>&s;nipe,</HI> to market, in peace. If they were &s;carce, we dur&s;t not a&s;k an advanced price; for if we did, a fine&mdash;or impri&s;onment, was our portion.&mdash;Did they al&s;o fix the price of <HI>&s;hop-goods?</HI> catch them at that, and I will humbly ask their pardon.&mdash;Where was honour at this time? Troth I cannot tell: But were it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, I could ea&s;ily tell you where &s;he was <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="013602_0011_0F95A69742F7A8A8">I may perhaps at another time, tell you a little more of my mind upon this matter: At pre&s;ent let us attend to another cir|cum&s;tance, which I think renders the honour of the New-York merchants a little &s;u&s;picious; and convinces me, that we have no &s;ufficient ground to tru&s;t to it. Common &s;en&s;e cannot utterly have quitted the city. There mu&s;t be &s;ome merchants who are &s;en&s;ible of the evil tendency of this Non-con&s;umption, Non-im|portation and Non-exportation agreement. But where is the man who has had honour enough to avow his &s;entiments and oppo&s;e it? Shew him to me, and I will reverence him as
<Q>The noble&s;t work of God.</Q>
Six hone&s;t merchants, who had honour, vir|tue, and courage enough, openly to avow their &s;entiments, and act accordingly, would yet &s;ave you, and their country, from ruin.</P>
<P>But the conduct of the merchants pre&s;ents a very different pro&s;pect. Whatever their particular &s;entiments may be, they all appear to acquie&s;ce in this fatal determination of our deluded Congre&s;s. They &s;eem to have expected it; for it is &s;aid, that they have imported much more largely than u&s;ual: This makes me &s;u&s;pect, that this bu&s;tle about Non-importation, &amp;c. has its ri&s;e, not from Patrioti&s;m, but &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. I have heard that merchants &s;ometimes make an artificial &s;carcity, by engro&s;&s;ing particular commodities in a few hands, that they may avail them&s;elves of the nece&s;&s;ity of the buyer, and get a good price. We Countrymen are in this &s;ituation. No more goods can be imported: the merchants have us at their mercy: let them &s;et their price ever &s;o high, nece&s;&s;ity will oblige us to come to their terms.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider the matter in another light, and &s;till it will appear, that this Non-importation &s;cheme will and mu&s;t rai&s;e the prices of goods; not only now, but probably for &s;ome years to come.</P>
<P>There are in New-York many merchants with large capitals, and of very exten&s;ive credit: the&s;e probably have laid in a large &s;upply of goods, enough to la&s;t as long as the Non-importation continues. At lea&s;t, when their &s;tores are like to become empty, they will have weight enough to break up the agreement. There are many other merchants who&s;e capitals are &s;mall, and their credit confined: the&s;e probably can have laid in no great &s;tock. If the Non-importation agreement continues any length of time, the wealthy merchant will grow enormou&s;ly rich, the merchant with a &s;mall capital will probably fail. For con&s;ider&mdash;the &s;mall merchant mu&s;t &s;ell his goods as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, that he may &s;up|port his family, and his credit by making timely remittances. The wealthy merchant can wait till the &s;mall &s;tores are exhau&s;ted,
<PB N="13" REF="013602_0012_0F95A69796B16ED8">
and then he may command a double profit: in the mean time the inferior merchant is out of bu&s;ine&s;s: his goods are all &s;old, and &s;old at a &s;mall profit: he cannot import: he mu&s;t live on his &s;mall capital. As &s;oon as the wealthy merchant finds his &s;tore near empty, he will have influence enough to break the agreement; and money and credit enough to import largely again: but the inferior merchant is ruined: he has lived on his capital: it is gone: if he is not in <HI>debt,</HI> he has nothing to be|gin trade with; and he mu&s;t become a clerk to his wealthy neighbour.</P>
<P>The&s;e inferior merchants are of great con&s;equence to the com|munity: they keep down the price of goods, and prevent its becoming exce&s;&s;ive: they mu&s;t make quick &s;ales that they may make their remittances in due &s;ea&s;on. They mu&s;t therefore take what their goods will fetch: But the wealthy merchant can wait for a better price, without hurting his e&s;tate or credit; or el&s;e he mu&s;t be content with the &s;ame advance with the merchant of &s;mall capital.</P>
<P>Another argument to prove that the prices of goods will in|crea&s;e is, that they are already increa&s;ed, even before the fatal day fixed for the commencement of the Non-importation Agree|ment. Several per&s;ons, whom I take to be good judges, have a&s;|&s;ured me, that the prices of woollens, linens, &amp;c. are very per|ceptibly increa&s;ed in the &s;hops in New-York. And I was told, by a very credible man from New-York, that the price of gun-powder was rai&s;ed from 9 or 10l. to 17 or 18l. per hundred. I know you'll &s;tare, and wi&s;h to know what could &s;o enor|mou&s;ly advance the article of Gun-powder: I'll tell you; It was the great and &s;udden demand for it, when the Putmans and Co. of New-England, were in &s;uch a violent hurry to di|vert them&s;elves with fighting the King's troops: and &s;hould the&s;e heroes take it into their heads to divert them&s;elves with pu&s;h-pin. I &s;uppo&s;e the price of <HI>pins</HI> would ri&s;e in the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>I come now to the con&s;ideration of another probable con&s;e|quence of a Non-importation agreement, which is, That it will excite the re&s;entment of the government at home again&s;t us, and induce the Parliament to block up our ports and prevent our trade intirely. It would certainly be good policy in the govern|ment to do &s;o. Few Colonies are &s;ettled but by a trading people, and by them chiefly for the benefit of trade: The grand de&s;ign of England in &s;ettling the American Colonies, was to extend her trade&mdash;to open a new vent for her manufactures. If then we
<PB N="14" REF="013602_0013_0F95A6984EE97588">
&s;top our imports, the benefit of our trade is in a manner lo&s;t to her, and &s;he would find but little additional di&s;advantage, &s;hould &s;he &s;top our trade with all the world.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the government pur&s;ue milder mea&s;ures&mdash;though we indeed have no right to expect it will&mdash;yet the Congre&s;s have determined the expediency of our &s;topping our own trade, after a limited time, viz. ten months. In either ca&s;e the con|&s;equence will be much the &s;ame; and it matters but little whether the government blocks up our ports, or whether we our&s;elves voluntarily put an end to our exports, as well as imports; after the 10th of September next we are to have but little trade except with our neighbouring colonies.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider the con&s;equence, Should the government interpo&s;e, we &s;hall have no trade at all, and con&s;equently no vent for the produce of our farms. Such part of our wheat, flax-&s;eed, corn, beef, pork, butter, chee&s;e, as was not con&s;umed in the pro|vince, mu&s;t be left to rot and &s;tink upon our hands.</P>
<P>Should the government leave us to our&s;elves, the little trade that would be open, would never keep the&s;e articles at &s;uch a price, as to make it worth while to rai&s;e more of them than we want for our own con&s;umption.</P>
<P>Look well to your&s;elves, I be&s;eech you. From the day that the exports from this province are &s;topped, the farmers may date the commencement of their ruin. Can you live without money? Will the &s;hop-keeper <HI>give</HI> you his goods? Will the weaver, &s;hoemaker, black&s;mith, carpenter, work for you without pay? If they will, it is more than they will do for me. And unle&s;s you can &s;ell your produce, how are you to get money? Nor will the ca&s;e be better, if you are obliged to &s;ell your produce at an under-rate; for then it will not pay you for the labour and expence of rai&s;ing it. But this is the lea&s;t part of the di&s;tre&s;s that will come upon you.</P>
<P>Unhappily, many of you are in debt, and obliged to pay the enormous intere&s;t of &s;even pounds on the hundred, for con&s;ider|able &s;ums. It matters not whether your debts have been con|tracted through nece&s;&s;ity, or carele&s;ne&s;s: You mu&s;t pay them, at <HI>lea&s;t</HI> the intere&s;t, punctually; the u&s;urer will not wait long; indeed you cannot expect he &s;hould: You have had his money, and are obliged, in ju&s;tice, to pay him the principal and intere&s;t, according to agreement. But without &s;elling your produce,
<PB N="15" REF="013602_0014_0F95A69950265A88">
you can neither pay the one, nor the other; the con&s;equence will be that after a while, a proce&s;s of law will be commenced again&s;t you, and your farms mu&s;t be &s;old by execution; and then you will have to pay not only principal and intere&s;t, but Sheriffs fees, Lawyers fees, and a long li&s;t of <HI>et caeteras.</HI></P>
<P>Nor, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, will your farms fetch half what they co&s;t you. What is a farm good for, the produce of which cannot be &s;old? Had matters continued in their old cour&s;e, &s;ome one of your neighbours, who knew the value of your farm, might have been willing and able to have given you a rea&s;onable price for it, had you been di&s;po&s;ed, or obliged to &s;ell; but he has more wit than to buy a farm, when he cannot &s;ell its produce. Your creditor then, or &s;ome rich merchant, or u&s;urer, mu&s;t take it at their own price: To you it is of no con&s;equence who takes it; for you are ruined, &s;tripped of your farm, and very pro|bably of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance for your&s;elf and family. Glorious effect of Non-exportation! Think a little, and then tell me&mdash; when the Congre&s;s adopted this cur&s;ed &s;cheme, did they in the lea&s;t con&s;ider your intere&s;t? No, impo&s;&s;ible! they ignorantly mi&s;under&s;tood, carele&s;ly neglected, or ba&s;ely betrayed you.</P>
<P>But, it is &s;aid, that all legal proce&s;&s;es are to be &s;topped, ex|cept in criminal ca&s;es.&mdash;That is to &s;ay&mdash;the lower cla&s;s of people are to be deprived of their daily bread, by being thrown out of employment by the Non-Exportation agreement; to prevent &s;tarving, many of them will be tempted to &s;teal; if they &s;teal, they are to be hanged. The di&s;hone&s;t fellow, who owes money, may, by refu&s;ing payment, ruin his creditor; but there is no remedy, no proce&s;s is to be i&s;&s;ued again&s;t him. This may be ju&s;tice, but it looks &s;o much like cruelty, that a man of a hu|mane heart would be more apt to call it by the latter, than the former name.</P>
<P>But pray, by who&s;e authority are the courts of Ju&s;tice to be &s;hut up, in all civil ca&s;es?&mdash;Who &s;hall DARE to &s;top the Courts of ju&s;tice?&mdash;A very pretty &s;tory indeed! I buy a cow of my poor neighbour, and I promi&s;e to pay him at Chri&s;tmas: he wants the money to pay his &s;hoe-maker, taylor, &amp;c. my ra&s;cally neighbour, on the other &s;ide, owes me ten pounds; I depend upon this money to pay for the cow: he refu&s;es payment: the Courts of Ju&s;tice are &s;hut up: I cannot &s;ue him, nor can I pay my debt for want of the money.</P>
<P>My neighbour Dick Stubbs has a farm which he rents to Peter Doubtful for 20l. a year. Dick is an hone&s;t, good &s;ort of a
<PB N="16" REF="013602_0015_0F95A69E143E9630">
man, but rather negligent, and depends upon this 20l. to enable him to make both ends of the year meet, as we &s;ay. There is one Tim Twi&s;twell, a Ra&s;cal from New-England, who lays claim to Stubbs's farm, tho' he has no more right to it than the Pope of Rome. He knows his right is good for nothing, and has never dared to pro&s;ecute it, though he has money enough, and has been <HI>harping</HI> upon it the&s;e &s;even years. But he has lately made &s;everal attempts to corrupt Doubtful the tenant. Should he &s;ucceed, and get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the farm, how is Stubbs to re|cover his right, when the courts of ju&s;tice are &s;hut up? You may &s;ay that he mu&s;t wait till the courts are opened, and then he may pro&s;ecute his claim. It may be &s;o. But remember, that the &s;ame violence which now &s;huts the courts of ju&s;tice, may keep them &s;hut, till poor Stubbs is ab&s;olutely ruined.</P>
<P>Rou&s;e, my Friends, rou&s;e from your &s;tupid lethargy. Mark the men who &s;hall dare to impede the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice. Brand them as the infamous betrayers of the rights of their country. The grand &s;ecurity of the property, the liberty, the lives of Engli&s;hmen, con&s;i&s;ts in the due admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. While the courts are duly attended to, and fairly conducted, our proper|ty is &s;afe. As &s;oon as they are &s;hut, every thing is precarious: for neither property, nor liberty, have any foundation to &s;tand upon.</P>
<P>Tell me not of Delegates, Congre&s;&s;es, Committees, Riots, Mobs, In&s;urrections, A&s;&s;ociations,&mdash;a plague on them all.&mdash;Give me the &s;teady, uniform, unbia&s;&s;ed influence of the Courts of Ju&s;tice. I have been happy under their protection, and I tru&s;t in God, I &s;hall be &s;o again.</P>
<P>But after all, &s;ome of you, I fear, look forward with plea&s;ure, to tho&s;e halcyon days of &s;ecurity, when the Courts &s;hall be &s;hut. Undi&s;turbed by the clamours of creditors, undi&s;mayed by the fight of the Sheriff, you think to pa&s;s your lives in quietne&s;s and peace.&mdash;But ah! my friends! tru&s;t not the fatal, the ill-judged &s;ecurity. You would not, I hope, be &s;o di&s;hone&s;t as not to do your utmo&s;t endeavour to pay your debts; be&s;ides, while the Courts of Ju&s;tice are &s;hut, you will be apt to be carele&s;s. You will neglect paying your intere&s;t, your debts will accumu|late, your creditors will be irritated; and as &s;oon as a legal pro|ce&s;s can be commenced, you will be ruined before you can look about you.</P>
<P>Some of you are indebted to the loan-office. You have your money, it is true, at a low rate: You pay only five <HI>per centum:</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="013602_0016_0F95A69FBB711A20">
But if you cannot &s;ell your produce, you can no more pay five <HI>per cent.</HI> than &s;even. The &s;hutting up of the Courts of Ju&s;tice can here give you no relief. By virtue of the act which regu|lates the Loan-Office, your farms, if you fail to pay the intere&s;t, will be &s;old in a limited time, without any judicial proce&s;s at all.</P>
<P>Some of you, al&s;o, are tenants at will; and if you fail in paying your rents, you may be turned off, with little or no warning.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider now the &s;ituation you will be in, if Great-Britain, provoked by your Non-Importation Agreement, &s;hould &s;hut up our ports; or &s;hould the Non-Exportation agreed to by the Con|gre&s;s, take effect. In that ca&s;e you will not be able to &s;ell your produce: you cannot pay even the intere&s;t of the money you are indebted for: your farms mu&s;t be &s;old, and you and your fami|lies turned out, to beggary and wretchedne&s;s.&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed fruits of Non-Importation and Non-Exportation! The farmer that is in debt, will be ruined: the farmer that is clear in the world, will be obliged to run in debt, to &s;upport his family: and while the proud merchant, and the for&s;worn &s;muggler, riot in their ill-gotten wealth; the laborious farmers, the grand &s;upport of every well-regulated country, mu&s;t all go to the dogs together.&mdash; Vile! Shamefull! Diabolical Device!</P>
<P>Let us now attend a little to the Non-Con&s;umption Agree|ment, which the Congre&s;s, in their A&s;&s;ociation, have impo&s;ed up|on us. After the fir&s;t of March we are not to purcha&s;e or u&s;e any Ea&s;t-India Tea what&s;oever; nor any goods, wares, or mer|chandize from Great-Britain or Ireland, imported after the fir&s;t day of December next: nor any mola&s;&s;es, &s;yrups, &amp;c. from the Briti&s;h plantations in the We&s;t-Indies, or from Dominica; nor wine from Madeira, or the We&s;tern I&s;lands; nor foreign indigo.</P>
<P>Will you &s;ubmit to this &s;lavi&s;h regulation?&mdash;You mu&s;t.&mdash; Our &s;overeign Lords and Ma&s;ters, the High and Mighty Dele|gates, in Grand Continental Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, have ordered and directed it. They have directed the Committees in the re|&s;pective colonies, to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch further regulations as they may think proper, for carrying their a&s;&s;ociation, of which this Non-con&s;umption agreement is a part, into execution. Mr.******** of New York, under the authority of their High-Mightine&s;&s;es, the Delegates, by, and with the advice of his Privy Council, the Committee of New York, hath i&s;&s;ued his mandate, bearing date Nov. 7, 1774, recommending it to the freeholders and free|men
<PB N="18" REF="013602_0017_0F95A69FF08D69B0">
of New-York, to a&s;&s;emble on the 18th of November, to choo&s;e eight per&s;ons out of every ward, to be a Committee, to carry the A&s;&s;ociation of the Congre&s;s into execution.&mdash;The bu&s;ine&s;s of the Committee &s;o cho&s;en is to be, to in&s;pect the con|duct of the inhabitants, and &s;ee whether they violate the A&s;&s;o|ciation.&mdash;Among other things, Whether they drink any Tea or wine in their families, after the fir&s;t of March; or wear any Briti&s;h or Iri&s;h manufactures; or u&s;e any Engli&s;h mola&s;&s;es, &amp;c. imported after the fir&s;t day of December next.

<P>Probably, as &s;oon as this point is &s;ettled in New-York, the &s;aid Mr. ***** *** in the plenitude of his power, by, and with the advice of his Privy Council afore&s;aid, will i&s;&s;ue his Mandate to the &s;upervi&s;ors in the &s;everal counties, as he did about the choice of Delegates, and direct them to have Committees cho&s;en in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts, for the &s;ame laudable purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Will you be in&s;trumental in bringing the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery on your&s;elves? Will you choo&s;e &s;uch Committees?

<P>Did you choo&s;e your &s;upervi&s;ors for the purpo&s;e of in&s;laving you?

<P>But however, as I &s;aid before, do as you plea&s;e: If you like it better, choo&s;e your Committe, or &s;uffer it to be cho&s;en by half a dozen Fools in your neighbourhood,&mdash;open your doors to them,&mdash;let them examine your tea-canni&s;ters, and mola&s;&s;es-jugs, and your wives and daughters petty-coats,&mdash;bow, and cringe, and tremble, and quake,&mdash;fall down and wor&s;hip our &s;overeign Lord the Mob.&mdash;But I repeat it, By H&mdash;n, I will not.&mdash;No, my hou&s;e is my ca&s;tle: as &s;uch I will con&s;ider it, as &s;uch I will defend it, while I have breath. No <HI>King's</HI> officer &s;hall enter it without my permi&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s &s;upported by a warrant from a magi&s;trate.&mdash;And &s;hall my hou&s;e be entered, and my mode of living enquired into, by a domineering Committee-man?

<P>Do, I &s;ay, as you plea&s;e: but &s;hould any pragmatical Com|mittee-gentleman come to my hou&s;e, and give him&s;elf airs, I &s;hall &s;hew him the door, and if he does not &s;oon take him&s;elf away, a good hiccory cudgel &s;hall teach him better manners.</P>
<P>There is one article more of the A&s;&s;ociation, which exhibits &s;uch a &s;triking in&s;tance of the ignorance, or inattention of the Congre&s;s to the Farmers intere&s;t, that I mu&s;t take notice of it to you; e&s;pecially as it will give me an opportunity of mentioning as &s;triking an in&s;tance of the arbitrary, illegal, and tyrannical procedure of the Committee of Corre&s;pondence in New-York.</P>
<P>The article I mean, is the &s;eventh, relative to the encrea&s;ing of the number and improving of the breed of &s;heep. No &s;heep of any kind are to be exported to the We&s;t-Indies, or el&s;ewhere. Why, for Gods &s;ake, were <HI>weathers</HI> included in this prohibi|tion? Will weathers encrea&s;e the number, or improve the breed of &s;heep? I wi&s;h the Gentlemen of the Congre&s;s, and the Com|mittee-men of New-York, would try the experiment. Let them buy a &s;core of weathers, and feed, and nur&s;e them for a twelve-month; and then publi&s;h an account of the number of lambs they have produced, their enormous &s;ize, with the quantity &amp; fine|ne&s;s of their wool; that we may know in what manner the num+ber
<PB N="20" REF="013602_0019_0F95A6A16C5CDF60">
and breed of &s;heep may be encrea&s;ed, and improved, by keep|ing weathers. But let this account be under oath, or I &s;hall not believe that they have &s;ucceeded, either in encrea&s;ing the num|ber, or improving the breed. I &s;olemnly declare I never had one lamb produced from a weather in my whole life; and have always been &s;o ignorant, that I &s;hould no more expect a lamb from a weather, than a calf from an ox.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, that weathers will produce wool, and that it is for the &s;ake of the wool that their exportation is prevented. I readily own that weathers will produce wool, though not lambs. But let me a&s;k you, my brother farmers, which of you would keep a flock of &s;heep barely for the &s;ake of their wool? Not one of you. If you cannot &s;ell your &s;heep to advantage at a certain age, you cannot keep them to any profit. An Ewe &s;hould not be kept after &s;he is &s;ix years old, nor a weather after he is four: few of you choo&s;e to keep them &s;o long. What now mu&s;t be done with our &s;heep when they become &s;o old that we can keep them no longer with advantage? We are ordered <HI>to kill them &s;paringly:</HI> a queer phra&s;e; however, let it pa&s;s. If it is not <HI>cla&s;&s;ical,</HI> it is <HI>congre&s;&s;ional</HI>; and that's enough. And after having killed them <HI>&s;paringly,</HI> if we have any to <HI>&s;pare,</HI> we mu&s;t <HI>&s;pare</HI> them to our poor neighbours. But &s;uppo&s;ing that after <HI>killing them &s;paringly, and &s;paring</HI> as many to my poor neighbours as they want, I &s;hould, by rea&s;on of <HI>killing them &s;paringly,</HI> have &s;till more to <HI>&s;pare</HI>&mdash; what &s;hall I do with them? Exported they mu&s;t not be. Why! fat them well, and &s;ell them to the New-Yorkers: The deuce take them for a &s;et of gundy gutted fellows&mdash;will they let us export nothing? Do they intend to eat all our wheat, and rye, and corn, and beef, and pork, and mutton, and butter, and chee&s;e, and turkeys, and gee&s;e, and ducks, and fowls, and chickens and eggs, &amp;c? the devil is in't if their bellies are not filled. And yet &s;ee their ill-nature and malice again&s;t us farmers.&mdash;After having furni&s;hed them with all this good cheer, which they mu&s;t have at their own price too, they will not in return let us have a di&s;h of tea to plea&s;e our wives, nor a gla&s;s of Madeira to cheer our &s;pirits, nor even a &s;poonful of Mola&s;&s;es to &s;weeten our butter-milk. To be &s;erious&mdash;</P>
<P>Had the Congre&s;s attended in the lea&s;t to the farmers intere&s;t, they never would have prohibited the exportation of &s;heep, after they came to a certain age. It is the exportation that keeps up the price of &s;heep; it is the advantageous price that encourages the farmer to feed them: Take away the profit of &s;elling them, and the farmer will keep but very few. For they are not, and I am confident never will be in this country, worth keeping for their wool alone.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="013602_0020_0F95A6A31E947208">However, right or wrong, the Congre&s;s have pa&s;&s;ed the de|cree. <HI>Thou &s;halt not export &s;heep,</HI> was pronounced at Philadel|phia; and, right or wrong, the Committee of New-York are de|termined to put it in execution: And <HI>thou &s;halt not export &s;heep,</HI> is echoed back from New-York.</P>
<P>How this decree is to be &s;upported in New-York, may be learned from the following affair. A Gentleman, an officer in the King's &s;ervice, had purcha&s;ed a number of &s;heep to carry with him to St. Vincent's: Mr. GAINE's news-paper &s;ays eighteen. The New-Yorkers, probably affraid that they &s;hould loo&s;e their &s;hare of the mutton, a&s;&s;embled on the dock, &s;ent for the Com|mittee, and in open violation of the laws of their country, obliged the merchant to whom the ve&s;&s;el had been con&s;igned, to have the &s;heep landed; the &s;heep were committed to &s;afe durance till the ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed, and then were delivered to the proprietor&mdash; I &s;uppo&s;e to the per&s;on who had &s;old them to the officer: Though how he could be the proprietor after he had &s;old them, I cannot &s;ee. Had I been the per&s;on, I would have had nothing to do with them; the Committee might have done what they plea&s;ed with them&mdash;<HI>killed them &s;paringly,</HI> or <HI>&s;pared</HI> them to their poor neighbours. But had there been law or ju&s;tice in the govern|ment, I would have been paid for them: though, now I think of it, I would have made a pre&s;ent of them to the Committee, upon condition that they &s;hould make the experiment how far the number and breed of &s;heep can be increa&s;ed and improved by keeping weathers; for I have been po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured, that the&s;e &s;ame &s;heep, which made all this bu&s;tle, were nothing more.</P>
<P>Here now, my friends, is a flagrant in&s;tance of inju&s;tice and cruelty committed by a riotous mob;&mdash;for a number of people, be they Committee-men, or who you plea&s;e, a&s;&s;embled to do an unlawful action, e&s;pecially in the night, de&s;erve no better name,&mdash;again&s;t both the buyer and &s;eller of the &s;heep, in open viola|tion of the laws of the government in which we live, and of the rights of the city in which it was perpetrated; and not a &s;ingle magi&s;trate had virtue or courage enough to interpo&s;e. O &s;hame to humanity! Hold up your heads, ye Committee-men of New-York! Deny the charge if ye can. But remember, the in&s;tant ye deny it, ye forfeit all preten&s;ions to truth or con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Think me not too &s;evere. Anarchy and Confu&s;ion, Violence and Oppre&s;&s;ion, di&s;tre&s;s my country; and I mu&s;t, and <HI>will</HI> &s;peak. Though the open violator of the laws may e&s;cape puni&s;hment, through the pu&s;illanimity of the magi&s;trates, he &s;hall feel the
<PB N="22" REF="013602_0021_0F95A6A396B05980">
la&s;h of my pen: and he &s;hall feel it again and again, till remor&s;e &s;hall &s;ting his guilty con&s;cience, and &s;hame cover his oppro|brious head.</P>
<P>But perhaps you will &s;ay, that the&s;e men are contending for our rights; that they are defending our liberties; and though they act again&s;t law, yet that the nece&s;&s;ity of the times will ju&s;tify them. Let me &s;ee. I fell a number of &s;heep. I drive them to New-York, and deliver them to the purcha&s;er. A mob inter|po&s;es, and obliges me to take my &s;heep again, and drive them home for my pains, or &s;ell them there for ju&s;t what they plea&s;e to give me. Are the&s;e the rights, is this the liberty, the&s;e men are contending for? It is vile, abject &s;lavery, and I will have none of it. The&s;e men defend our rights, and liberties, who act in open defiance of the laws? No. They are making us the mo&s;t abject &s;laves that ever exi&s;ted. The nece&s;&s;ity of the times ju&s;tify them in violating the fir&s;t principles of civil &s;ociety! Who induced this nece&s;&s;ity? Who involved the province in di&s;|cord, anarchy and confu&s;ion? The&s;e very men. They created that nece&s;&s;ity, which they now plead in their own ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>Let me intreat you, my Friends, to have nothing to do with the&s;e men, or with any of the &s;ame &s;tamp. Peace and quietne&s;s &s;uit <HI>you</HI> be&s;t. Confu&s;ion, and Di&s;cord, and Violence, and War, are &s;ure de&s;truction to the <HI>farmer.</HI> Without peace he cannot till his lands; unle&s;s protected by the laws, he cannot carry his pro|duce to market. Peace indeed is departed from us for the pre|&s;ent, and the protection of the laws has cea&s;ed. But I tru&s;t in God, there is yet one method left, which, by prudent manage|ment, will free us from all our difficulties; re&s;tore peace again to our dwellings, and give us the firm &s;ecurity of the laws for our protection. Renounce all dependence on Congre&s;&s;es, and Committees. They have neglected, or betrayed your intere&s;ts. Turn then your eyes to your <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> repre&s;entatives. They are the true, and legal, and have been hitherto, the faithful defenders of your rights, and liberties; and you have no rea&s;on to think but that they will ever be &s;o. They will probably &s;oon meet in General A&s;&s;embly. Addre&s;s your&s;elves to them. They are the proper per&s;ons to obtain redre&s;s of any grievances that you can ju&s;tly complain of. You can tru&s;t their wi&s;dom and prudence, that they will u&s;e the mo&s;t rea&s;onable, con&s;titutional, and effectual methods of re&s;toring that peace and harmony, between Great Britain and this province, which is &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for by all good men, and which is &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the happine&s;s of us all. Pre&s;ent a petition to them, intreating them to take
<PB N="23" REF="013602_0022_0F95A6A4495465B0">
the matter into their own hands, and to labour earne&s;tly to ac|compli&s;h &s;o ble&s;&s;ed a purpo&s;e. But beware of giving them any directions <HI>how</HI> to proceed. As &s;oon as ever you attempt to <HI>in&s;truct</HI> them, you lay your&s;elves open to be duped and fooled by de&s;ign|ing men, in the drawing of your in&s;tructions. Some will in|&s;truct them to do one thing, and &s;ome another, and you will em|barra&s;s, but not help forward their deliberations.</P>
<P>Your REPRESENTATIVES know perfectly the &s;tate of the un|happy breach between our mother country and us. They want no information in this point. The more you tru&s;t them at this time, the more you will put it in their power to &s;erve you; and the greater obligation you will lay them under to &s;erve you <HI>faithfully,</HI> and <HI>effectually.</HI> Only be&s;eech them to heal this unnatural breach; to &s;ettle this de&s;tructive contention; that peace and quietne&s;s, and the firm protection of law, and good government, may again be our happy lot. Would the &s;everal counties, or towns in the province, conduct them&s;elves in this manner, God, I am confident, would ble&s;s, and give a pro&s;perous i&s;&s;ue to &s;o good a work.</P>
<P>And whatever you may be taught by de&s;igning men, to think of the government at home, they, I am certain, would embrace us with the arms of friend&s;hip; they would pre&s;s us to their bo&s;oms, to their hearts, would we give them a fair opportunity. This opportunity our <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> alone can give them. And this opportunity, I tru&s;t, they will give them, unle&s;s we prevent all po&s;&s;ibility of accommodation, by our own perver&s;ene&s;s, and ill conduct. And then, God only knows where our di&s;tre&s;&s;es may terminate.</P>
