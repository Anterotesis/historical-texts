<P>And he &s;aid unto Je&s;us, Lord, remember me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom. And Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, Verily, I &s;ay unto thee, To day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e.</P></Q>

<P>THE conver&s;ion and &s;alvation of a lo&s;t &s;in|ner, may ju&s;tly be reckoned among the wonderful works of God to the children of men. And &s;ometimes &s;uch circum|&s;tances attend the work, which greatly &s;erve to increa&s;e the wonder. Such an in&s;tance we have pre&s;ented to view in the text before us.</P>
<P>Here is a wretched &s;inner come to the brink of the grave, and the eternal world; in the broad way to hell.</P>
<P>That this was his ca&s;e, is evident from what St. Matthew and Mark relate of him. Matthew
<PB N="4" REF="012725_0004_0F8BC251A2CF6468">
&s;ays, that when the chief prie&s;ts, mocking him, with the &s;cribes and elders, &s;aid, he &s;aved others him&s;elf he cannot &s;ave: it he be the King of I&s;rael, let him now come down from the cro&s;s, and we will believe him. He tru&s;ted in God: let him deliver him now if he will have him: for he &s;aid, I am the Son of God. The thieves al&s;o (not one only, but both) which were crucified with him, ca&s;t the &s;ame in his teeth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 27.41, 42, 43, 44.</NOTE> They join|ed with tho&s;e who mocked the Son of God in the agonies of death. Mark &s;ays, and they that were crucified with him reviled him.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark 15.32.</NOTE> And in as much as revilers &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 6.10.</NOTE> we may &s;afely conclude, that he was &s;till in the way to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But, behold! all on a &s;udden, he is apprehend|ed by &s;overeign and all-powerful grace! he is con|vinced, and humbled&punc; believes and repents. He prays, and in an&s;wer to his prayer, receives a gracious promi&s;e from Chri&s;t, of a &s;udden tran&s;i|tion to the paradi&s;e of God!</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to this thief, the following parti|culars are ob&s;ervable.</P>
<P N="1">I. His conviction and humiliation. How|ever proof he might heretofore have been again&s;t convictions, now, at the very la&s;t period of his wretched life, the arrows of God penetrate his &s;toney heart; the law of God is &s;et home up|on his con&s;cience; with a convincing power and light, his eyes are opened to &s;ee his &s;ins, and the wrath of God to which his &s;ins had rendered him obnoxious; his con&s;cience is thoroughly a|wakened, and he is in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, to know, what he mu&s;t do to be &s;aved from that wrath,
<PB N="5" REF="012725_0005_0F8BC2523B815E30">
which he now &s;ees ju&s;t ready to fall on his guilty &s;oul.&mdash;And his eyes are opened, not only to &s;ee the awful &s;tate that his &s;ins had brought him into, but al&s;o, that his pre&s;ent &s;ufferings, and whatever he might hereafter &s;uffer, are but a ju&s;t reward of his &s;ins: which di&s;covery is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to true humiliation. For unle&s;s the &s;in|ner &s;ees the ju&s;tne&s;s of his puni&s;hment, he never will be humble under it.</P>
<P>And that this was the ca&s;e with this malefac|tor, is evident from what the evangeli&s;t Luke relates of him in the chapter before us. For we read, that when the other malefactor, railed again&s;t Chri&s;t, this penitent thief rebuked him, &s;aying, do&s;t thou not fear God, &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame condemnation; and we indeed ju&s;tly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man (that is Chri&s;t) hath done nothing ami&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Context&punc; ver. 40, 41.</NOTE>&mdash; He fully confe&s;&s;es his own &s;in and guilt, and that the &s;entence of death he was now under, was ju&s;t. He al&s;o a&s;&s;erts the innocence of the &s;uffering Saviour of the world: which are convincing proofs that his conviction and humiliation were genuine, and that he was a &s;it object of divine compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">II. His faith and repentance.</P>
<P>He believes him whom he now &s;aw in the ago|nies of a &s;hameful death, to be the Lord of life. That he was a King, and had a kingdom: That crowns and kingdoms were at his dipo&s;e:&mdash;That he was able to &s;ave him from eternal death. To &s;uppo&s;e the contrary, would be to make his prayer a piece of down-right idolatry, and not an act of religious wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>And if we con&s;ider the &s;tate and condition that Chri&s;t was in, at that time when he believed; his
<PB N="6" REF="012725_0006_0F8BC2548CA941B8">
faith will appear the more wonderful. The Son of righteou&s;ne&s;s now &s;uffered a very great eclip&s;e, the glory of his Godhead was greatly ob&s;cur'd by his &s;ufferings: he was in the very depth of his humiliation; he was now under an unju&s;t &s;entence of death, and is numbered with tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, to undergo the pains of a &s;hameful death, and was now in the very agonies of it: now it was that his Father hid his face from him, and put the bitter cup of his wrath into his hand, which he mu&s;t needs drink up.</P>
<P>The &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t at this time were &s;uch, that the faith of his di&s;ciples was greatly &s;tagger|ed: One had betrayed him, another had denied him; and all had for&s;ook him, and fled.&mdash;But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e di&s;advantages, this penitent thief, by faith &s;aw him to be the only Sa|viour of peri&s;hing &s;inners, that he was able to &s;ave him in particular, and that there was no other &s;helter to which he could fly, and be &s;afe from the &s;torm of God's anger.&mdash;And by faith, he lay'd hold on him, as the only hope &s;et before him; and through faith in the &s;uffering Saviour, he obtain|ed the forgivne&s;s of all his &s;ins, and an inheritance among the &s;aints; as is evident from Chri&s;t's gra|cious promi&s;e to him. To day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>And he not only believes on Chri&s;t, but al&s;o repents; his repentance was not meerly legal, but evangelical. However &s;trongly he heretofore had been attached to &s;in, he now &s;ees the infinite moral evil of it, and loathing it in his heart, turns from it to God with &s;elf abhorrence.</P>
<P N="3">III. His prayer.</P>
<P>An unconverted man <HI>may</HI> pray; but a con|verted man <HI>will</HI> pray. Prayer is the breath of the
<PB N="7" REF="012725_0007_0F8BC2553919F738">
new-born &s;oul. Soon after Saul the per&s;ecutor was converted; it was &s;aid of him, behold he prayeth. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 9.11.</NOTE></P>
<P>This thief is no &s;ooner converted, but he in|&s;tantly falls to prayer. Lord remember me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom, q. d. When thou art enthron'd at the right-hand of thy Father; and partake&s;t of the glory, which thou had&s;t with him, before the world was; when thou art in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of thy mediatorial kingdom, for the carrying on the work of &s;inful man's redemp|tion; then remember me. Let me have a part in thy interce&s;&s;ion with the Father in behalf of peri&s;hing &s;inners: let thy precious blood, be &s;prinkled upon my guilty and polluted &s;oul, that thereby I may be ab&s;olved from my guilt, and thoroughly wa&s;hed from my filth. That when I leave this world, which I mu&s;t in&s;tantly do, and enter upon eternity, I may come to thee, and dwell forever with thee in thy kingdom of glory.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The gracious promi&s;e which he received from Chri&s;t in an&s;wer to his prayer: To day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>Although it is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;inners &s;hould merit any thing from God by their prayers; yet, by his in&s;titution, it is a means of grace, for them to be in the u&s;e of, for the obtaining of tho&s;e favors which he mo&s;t freely be&s;tows upon peri&s;hing &s;in|ners.</P>
<P>This penitent &s;inner prayed to Chri&s;t to remem|ber him when he came into his kingdom; and Chri&s;t makes a promi&s;e to him, of the greate&s;t good he was capable of receiving To be forever with Chri&s;t in his kingdom, and to be glorified to|gether with him, is the greate&s;t honor, and the
<PB N="8" REF="012725_0008_0F8BC255FA4C2608">
greate&s;t happine&s;s our nature is capable of re|ceiving.</P>
<P>If we would &s;ee the exceeding preciou&s;ne&s;s of the promi&s;e, made to this condemned malefactor, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, (1.) The time when it was made: it was, when he was in&s;tantly to leave the world, and enter upon eternity; where his &s;tate mu&s;t be fixed, and remain unalterable forever. (2.) When all the &s;ins of his pa&s;t vicious life &s;tared him in the face, and he &s;aw him&s;elf ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to everla&s;ting puni&s;hment. Oh! what a &s;upport and comfort mu&s;t this gracious promi&s;e be to his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;oul: the &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of the promi&s;e adds to its &s;weetne&s;s. (3.) That it was &s;peedily to be fulfilled; his faith, hope, and pati|ence, were not to be long exerci&s;ed in waiting for the accompli&s;hment of it. The promi&s;e was made and fulfilled the &s;ame day: To-day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e. A ble&s;&s;ed change indeed, to go from earth to heaven, from the company of mortal men, to be in company with Chri&s;t, holy angels, and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect; from the pains of death, to inherit eternal life; from the &s;hame of an accur&s;ed death, to wear a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>The APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>And 1. A word by way of caution. Let none be encouraged from the example of this thief's finding mercy at the very la&s;t, to put off their re|pentance, and turning to God, until they come to die. The extraordinary and miraculous conver|&s;ion of the thief on the cro&s;s, is not left on record, that we &s;hould make &s;uch an improvement of it. For, as we received all from God, it is highly rea&s;onable, that all our time and &s;trength &s;hould
<PB N="9" REF="012725_0009_0F8BC257345F16D8">
be employed in his &s;ervice: we have no time to throw away in the &s;ervice of the world, the fle&s;h, and the devil.</P>
<P>God calls upon &s;inners to remember him in the days of their youth: and there is a promi&s;e, that tho&s;e that &s;eek him early &s;hall find him. Chri&s;t enjoins it as a duty incumbent upon all, to &s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of heaven and the righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof: and therefore it highly concerns every &s;inner &s;peedily to for&s;ake his &s;ins, and turn to God. He that puts off his repentance for the pre|&s;ent, is in great danger of loo&s;ing his &s;oul. For now is the time that God calls upon &s;inners to repent, and offers them his holy Spirit to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the difficult work: nor have &s;inners any a&s;&s;urance that they &s;hall ever have another offer of grace, or an opportunity to turn to God. Be|hold now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of &s;alvation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 6.2</NOTE> To day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb 3 7</NOTE></P>
<P>Moreover, the longer &s;inners continue in &s;in, the more hardned their hearts are through the deceit|fulne&s;s of it. The longer the work of conver&s;ion is put off, the greater will the difficulties be that will attend it.</P>
<P>Nor let any de&s;pair of the mercy of God while they have life.</P>
<P>Although God might ju&s;tly &s;ay to every &s;inner that puts off his repentance until he is in agonies of death, and upon the very brink of hell, and then in his di&s;tre&s;s cries for mercy: I have called, and ye have refu&s;ed, I have &s;tretched out my hand, and no man regarded. I al&s;o will laugh at your ca|lamity,
<PB N="10" REF="012725_0010_0F8BC257C15EA1B8">
I will mock when your fear cometh. <NOTE PLACE="foot">Pro. 1.24, 26.</NOTE>Yet &s;uch are the bowels of his compa&s;&s;ion toward peri&s;hing &s;inners, who in their di&s;tre&s;s call upon him for mercy; that &s;omtimes he be&s;tows his mercy upon them at the very la&s;t: &s;uch an in|&s;tance we have in the text.&mdash;Therefore let none de&s;pair of mercy, while they have breath to call upon God for it.</P>
<P>An Engli&s;h expo&s;itor makes the following judi|cious ob&s;ervation upon this text. Says he, "The &s;pirit of God fore&s;eeing what an ill u&s;e &s;ome would make of this in&s;tance, leaves <HI>one</HI> example upon record, that none might de&s;pair; and <HI>but</HI> one, that none might pre&s;ume." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Burkit.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. See the &s;overeignty of God, in be&s;towing his grace upon this condemned malefactor. Whenever God &s;hews mercy to &s;inners, he acts as a &s;overeign, but his &s;overeignty does more con|&s;picou&s;ly appear in the &s;alvation of &s;ome, than it does in the &s;alvation of others; and perhaps in none more than in this wretched &s;inner.&mdash;He had &s;pent his whole life in rebellion again&s;t God, and is now brought to the public place of execution, to die by the hand of ju&s;tice, having by his &s;in forfeited his life: and although he is now as it were in the very &s;uburbs of hell; can join with tho&s;e that mocked and reviled the Son of God in his dying agonies. Surely none appears le&s;s qual|lified to receive mercy than he, or le&s;s de&s;erving of it.&mdash;But while he is in this &s;tate, he is appre|hended by &s;overeign grace, and mercy triumphs in his &s;alvation.&mdash;And what &s;hall we &s;ay to the&s;e things? Surely he will have mercy on whom he will.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="11" REF="012725_0011_0F8BC25DA1BE8CC0">3. See the efficacious power of divine grace. It is not all the thunder from Mount-Sinai, or the greate&s;t degrees of legal terror a &s;inner is capable of &s;uffering, that will change his heart. All the law can do, is to convince the &s;inner of his &s;ins, to awaken his con&s;cience, alarm his fears, and &s;hew him his need of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But that which the law cannot do, grace can. Oh! what a marvellous change was in&s;tantly wrought in this malefactor by the energy of grace! Perhaps the &s;ame hour in which he reviled Chri&s;t, he becomes a true penitent; freely confe&s;&s;ing his &s;ins, acknowledging that he &s;uffered ju&s;tly, and that Chri&s;t &s;uffered unju&s;tly. He now &s;orrows for &s;in with a godly &s;orrow; his &s;orrow worked re|pentance to &s;alvation, not to be repented of. He is now become a new creature: old things are pa&s;t away; behold, all things are become new.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5.17.</NOTE>&mdash; Sanctifying grace, in a gracious mea&s;ure, had pu|rified his heart from &s;in, and he is able to perform the acts of believing, repenting, and turning to God; which are proper to the new creature only&punc; nor is it po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch an effect &s;hould proceed from any other cau&s;e. It is grace only, that &s;ub|dues the corruptions of the heart, and re&s;tores the moral image of God to the &s;ouls of men. Therefore, what great rea&s;on have the &s;inful chil|dren of men to be thankful to God, that he &s;hould ever conde&s;cend to be&s;tow his grace upon any.</P>
<P N="4">4. That if &s;inners would be partakers of the grace of God, they mu&s;t &s;eek to him for it thro' a crucified Saviour.</P>
<P>For, although God acts mo&s;t freely <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> be&s;tows his grace upon &s;inners; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="12" REF="012725_0012_0F8BC25E68B83D78">
by all that they can do, to lay him under the lea&s;t obligation: yet he has appointed the means of grace for &s;inners to make u&s;e of, for the obtaining of grace, which he be&s;tows mo&s;t freely.</P>
<P>This is agreeable to the plan of the Go&s;pel, and therefore &s;inners may not neglect the means of grace, becau&s;e they cannot merit by the u&s;e of them. It is evident from the &s;criptures, that God ordinarily be&s;tows his grace upon &s;inners when they are u&s;ing the means pre&s;cribed in the go&s;pel for the obtaining of it. Faith cometh by hearing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE></P>
<P>The thief on the cro&s;s, as &s;oon as his eyes were opened to &s;ee his expo&s;edne&s;s to the wrath of God, and that there was no way for him to e&s;cape but to fly to the mercy of God in Chri&s;t; he in&s;tantly betook him&s;elf to prayer: Lord, remember me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom. It was the only means he could then make u&s;e of; the time was pa&s;t with him for other duties: and he does not neglect that; he poured out his &s;oul in &s;trong cries to Chri&s;t, whom he believed was able to &s;ave him from eternal death; and he obtained that which he &s;ought after; a promi&s;e of re&s;ting with Chri&s;t after he left the world.</P>
<P>I come now to addre&s;s my&s;elf to the pri&s;oner of death, who &s;tands here before us.</P>
<P>Ah! unhappy man! You are now come al|mo&s;t to the very clo&s;e of a mi&s;erable life.&mdash;Of late your time has been reckoned by weeks; and &s;ince that by days: now it is no longer days but hours: and &s;oon, Oh! very &s;oon, it will be no longer hours, but minutes, you'll have to live in this world; then you mu&s;t die and enter upon eternity&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="012725_0013_0F8BC25F2368F100">This day God requires your &s;oul of you: You are &s;ummoned this day to make your appearance before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t, to give an ac|count of all the deeds done in the body.

Although your body is under a &s;entence of death not to be revoked, which mu&s;t be &s;peedily executed: yet there is hope con|cerning the life of your precious &s;oul. If with a broken heart and a contrite &s;pirit, you confe&s;s your &s;ins to God, and lay hold on Chri&s;t by faith, (as many and as great as your &s;ins are) you &s;hall find mercy: He will ab&s;olve you from all your &s;ins, and ju&s;tify you freely, by imputing the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to you: He will receive you to his favor, and give you a place among the ble&s;&s;ed. Oh therefore be per&s;uaded in&s;tantly to ca&s;t your&s;elf upon Chri&s;t by faith.</P>
<P>And as motives to excite and &s;tir you up to com|ply with the exhortation, con&s;ider (I.) That you have no time to delay: You are within a few mo+ments of death and eternity.

For there is no wi&s;dom nor knowledge in the grave whither thou goe&s;t: As death leaves you, the judgment will find you. (2.)

The great ability of Chri&s;t to &s;ave you: he is not only willing but able al&s;o, to &s;ave to the utmo&s;t, all that come to him. It is &s;aid of him by the prophet I&s;aiah, That he is mighty to &s;ave! <NOTE PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 68.1.</NOTE>&mdash;He has paid the full price of man's redemption. By his active and pa&s;&s;ive o|bedience, the law of God is magnified and made honorable, his ju&s;tice fully &s;atisfied, and the honor of his moral government &s;ecured: &s;o that God can be ju&s;t in ju&s;tifying the greate&s;t &s;inner who believeth in Chri&s;t. Oh! the infinite efficacy of the blood of Chri&s;t! It is an all-&s;ufficient &s;acrifice of atonement for &s;in. And there are &s;ome of the very chief of &s;inners, &s;uch as Mana&s;&s;ah, Mary Magdalene, and a per&s;ecuting Saul, who now &s;hine in the kingdom of glory: the&s;e and a great multitude be&s;ides, which no man can number, were all redeemed to God by that precious blood.

But your pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, however great, is nothing, compared with the horror that your poor &s;oul will be filled with in&s;tantly after it leaves the body, if you are found in an unconverted &s;tate.&mdash;You mu&s;t be born again, and become a new creature. Pray earne&s;tly to God to give you a heart to re|pent of all your &s;ins, and that for Chri&s;t's &s;ake he would forgive you; that your tongue may &s;ing a|loud of his righteou&s;ne&s;s: that he would circum|ci&s;e your heart, to fear his great name, and to love him &s;upremely: that he would give grace to en|able you to be of a Chri&s;t-like temper and di&s;po|&s;ition towards all men. O take care you do not leave the world, cheri&s;hing enmity in your heart again&s;t any man; but forgive all men who have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t you, or you cannot expect for|givne&s;s from God. If you depart this life de&s;titute of the&s;e qualifications, you'll fall into the hands of an angry God; who will bring you to his bar to receive the dreadful &s;entence, Depart ye cur&s;ed into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. Oh! and can you bear the thoughts of an everla&s;ting &s;eparation from God? To &s;uffer the fiercene&s;s of his anger. And as there is none that can &s;ave you from the wrath to come but Chri&s;t, and he is both able and willing to do it; let me per&s;uade you by the terror of the Lord, to accept of him upon the terms of the go&s;pel. (5.) As a further motive to per&s;uade you to believe, repent, and turn to God in Chri&s;t, con&s;ider that your repentance will be matter of joy to the an|gels of God: There is joy in heaven over a re|penting &s;inner: yea, Chri&s;t him&s;elf will rejoice over you.

You are now filled with &s;hame, confu&s;ion covers you: but notwith&s;tanding, if like the penitent thief on the cro&s;s, you betake your&s;elf to Chri&s;t; as &s;oon as your &s;oul is &s;eparated from the body by death, guardian angels will take charge of it, and convey it &s;afe to heaven; and Chri&s;t him&s;elf will bid you welcome, &s;aying, Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

<P>I now come to addre&s;s my&s;elf to this very great congregation.</P>
<P>Here is a va&s;t number of people met to|gether this day, and God and your own con&s;cien|ces know be&s;t what ends you have in view in coming; whether to &s;atisfy your curio&s;ity, or that you might reap &s;ome good to your&s;elves from the heart-affecting &s;cene, that now is pre&s;ented to your light.</P>
<P>Sure I am, that unle&s;s you are much wanting in your duty to God, and your own &s;ouls, you may learn various u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons from this melan|choly providence.</P>
<P>And 1. See how much you are indebted to God for the re&s;traints of his grace, that hitherto have been upon you, whereby you have been kept back from tho&s;e outrageous acts of violence, that have brought others to an untimely death.</P>

Surely, it is the re&s;training grace of God be&s;towed upon you, that makes the difference. For had you been left to your&s;elves, to the government of your irregular pa&s;&s;ions, you would before this time, have plun|ged your&s;elves into the greate&s;t mi&s;ery. What rea&s;on then have you to adore the riches of God's goodne&s;s to you, and &s;ay, Why me, Lord!

By re|&s;traint a man may be kept back from &s;inning: but it is &s;anctifying grace alone that is &s;ufficient to &s;ub|due the corruptions of the heart, and to bring the &s;inner from under the dominion of &s;in. O there|fore pray earne&s;tly to God for regenerating grace. Say with the p&s;almi&s;t,&mdash;Who can under&s;tand his errors? Clean&s;e thou me from &s;ecret faults. Keep back thy &s;ervant al&s;o from pre&s;umptuous &s;ins, let them not have dominion over me: then &s;hall I be upright, and I &s;hall be innocent from the great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 19.12, 13.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider that it is your duty to take warn|ing by this malefactor: In him you may &s;ee in &s;ome mea&s;ure what &s;in is; that the wages of &s;in is death.

<P>Be ye therefore warned again&s;t the &s;in of drunk|enne&s;s. Drunkenne&s;s is a &s;in that awfully abounds in our land at this day. This is a very heinous &s;in in it&s;elf, and it is the more &s;o, as it oftentimes leads on to many other &s;ins, and &s;ometimes to the
<PB N="19" REF="012725_0019_0F8BC2650191BBC0">
&s;in of murder. For when men are intoxicated with &s;trong drink, many of them are ea&s;ily pro|voked to anger, and being almo&s;t as void of rea&s;on as the brute bea&s;ts, they are ea&s;ily prevailed upon by the devil, and their own corruptions, to &s;hed innocent blood. O therefore let every drunkard who hears me this day, be per&s;uaded to lay a&s;ide the practice of this abominable &s;in, le&s;t it &s;hould bring him to an untimely end.</P>
<P>Be ye al&s;o warned again&s;t ra&s;h anger. When men indulge them&s;elves in giving way to their pa&s;&s;ions, their anger oftentimes ari&s;eth to an un|due height, and then they are apt to u&s;e threat|ning language, and from abu&s;ive language to proceed to blows, which &s;ometimes prove fatal. Therefore guard again&s;t this &s;in: beg of God to give you grace to overcome all &s;inful anger; that you may learn of him who is meek and lowly in heart;<NOTE PLACE="foot">Mat. 11.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">9.</NOTE> Who when he was reviled, reviled not again: when he &s;uffered, he threatned not but committed him&s;elf to him that judgeth righte|ou&s;ly <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 2.23.</NOTE></P>
<P>I would al&s;o warn you again&s;t an inordinate love of the world. When mens hearts are &s;infully in love with filthy lucre, they are in great danger of being tempted to covet other men's goods; which covetous de&s;ires &s;ometimes hurry them on to commit the horrid &s;ins of theft, robbery, and mur|der. And as tho&s;e vices awfully prevail in the land, I would the more earne&s;tly exhort you to guard again&s;t the &s;nares of the devil. Let your conver|&s;ation be without covetou&s;ne&s;s&punc; and be content with &s;uch things as ye have.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 13.5.</NOTE></P>
<P>Once more. Let me warn you again&s;t fornica|tion; a &s;in that greatly abounds among us, to the

reproach of chri&s;tianity. There is a propriety in my cautioning you again&s;t this &s;in, upon this oc|ca&s;ion, becau&s;e it &s;ometimes leads on to the &s;in of murder; and there have been but too many in|&s;tances of it in this land; e&s;pecially among the fe|male &s;ex: For when they have been prevailed up|on to give up their cha&s;tity, and to commit the ob&s;cene act, and &s;hame begins to be&s;et them, then they lye open to the temptations of him who was the fir&s;t murderer; lay a&s;ide the bowels of a mo|ther, and lay violent hands on their tender offsp|ring, with a view to hide their &s;hame. Can a wo|man forget her &s;ucking child, that &s;he &s;hould not have compa&s;&s;ion on the &s;on of her womb? yea, they may forget. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 49.15.</NOTE> O therefore beg of God to keep you from this &s;oul &s;in when you are tempt|ed to it. Say with Jo&s;eph,&mdash;How then can I do this great wickedne&s;s and &s;in again&s;t God?</P>
<P>To conclude. Let me a&s;k your prayers in be|half of the poor malefactor, who mu&s;t this day, before the &s;un &s;ets, launch into the eternal world.</P>
<P>I hope that in this va&s;t a&s;&s;embly there are many praying &s;ouls, who have an intere&s;t at the throne of grace. You can't but behold him as an ob|ject of your pity! Nor is there any way open in which you can &s;o effectually be&s;tow your charity upon him, as by unitedly pouring out your &s;ouls in &s;trong cries to God for him; that he would &s;hew him mercy now at the very la&s;t. And the con&s;ideration of the great things which God has done, in an&s;wer to the united prayers of his peo|ple, are &s;ufficient motives to excite you to the performance of this duty.&mdash;May God of his in|finite mercy, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, receive his depart|ing &s;pirit.
