<BIBL>II. CHRON. XX. 11. 12.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Behold, how they reward us, to come to ca&s;t us out of thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which thou ha&s;t given us to inherit. O our God, wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might again&s;t this great company that cometh again&s;t us: neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO &s;peak with propriety upon a &s;ub|ject &s;o important as is the alarming and affecting &s;tate of political affairs in America, at the pre&s;ent day, is too arduous for me to attempt. To do it ju&s;tice, requires the force of the mo&s;t &s;ublime genius, and of art.&mdash;Con&s;cious therefore of my being in a great mea&s;ure de&s;titute of the&s;e accompli&s;hments; I have nothing to rely on but the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the known can|dour of this re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Not can I urge your attention by any other motive, than my hearty affection to this my na|tive country, and the warme&s;t wi&s;hes for her po|litical &s;alvation.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014474_0007_0F92B2FCA11BF7A8">
It is, my friends, our unhappy lot to live in the day of the American I&s;rael's trouble&mdash;our ene|mies are tho&s;e of our own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We were derived from the great family of Bri|tain, and therefore had &s;ome rational foundation to expect of her friendly treatment, her kind care and affection. But to our great di&s;appointment, and even con&s;ternation, &s;he has like an unnatural mother (entirely void of natural affection) turned again&s;t us, and is now &s;heathing her &s;word in our bowels; and thereby has plunged us in dire cala|mities, in the la&s;t di&s;tre&s;s of nations, the horrors of A CIVIL WAR! &s;o that we have rea&s;on to cry out in the language of the prophet Jeremiah, <HI>My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart: My heart maketh a noi&s;e in me, I cannot hold my peace, becau&s;e thou has heard. O my &s;oul, the &s;ound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</HI>&mdash;We find by dire experience, that <HI>"every battle of the warrior is with confu&s;ed noi&s;e, and garments rolled in blood."</HI></P>
<P>And the&s;e calamities, as before ob&s;erved, were brought upon us by tho&s;e who are allied to us by kindred blood; who, not content with their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and territories in their own proper coun|try, (together with &s;ome of our own children) have &s;ent an army, to ca&s;t us out of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which God gave to our forefathers and to us to inherit! and though we have, of our&s;elves, no &s;ufficient might again&s;t this great company, yet we hope that God will judge them</P>
<P>Our text, my friends, is part of the prayer of Jeho&s;haphat, when he was in the like di&s;tre&s;s, and proclaimed a fa&s;t.&mdash;A part of the army, which
<PB N="11" REF="014474_0008_0F92B2FD568F5078">
came again&s;t <HI>him,</HI> were the kindred of his own peo|ple&mdash;they were the Edomites, the po&s;terity of E&s;au, who was the brother of Jacob, the progeni|tor of the people of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>This appears from the ver&s;e next preceeding our text. Now behold the children of Ammon, and Moab, and <HI>Mount Seir,</HI> whom thou would'&s;t not let I&s;rael invade, &amp;c.&mdash;This Mount Seir was the country which the Edomites inhabited.&mdash;The children of I&s;rael had it in their power, when they pa&s;&s;ed thro' the territories of the &s;everal people above mentioned, when coming out of the land of Egypt, to have de&s;troyed them, and have laid wa&s;te their country&mdash;but they did not&mdash;they acted to|ward them the part of a kind, generous, and hu|mane people, and dealt with them as they might rea&s;onably expect to be treated.&mdash;Notwith&s;tand|ing this, the Edomites and others no &s;ooner found them&s;elves in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, than they rai&s;ed an army, and came to root out and extermi|nate the rightful proprietors of the land of Canaan.&mdash;Jeho&s;haphat in this ca&s;e, did not lean to his own under&s;tanding, did not put entire confidence in his own &s;trength; but proclaimed a fa&s;t, and &s;uppli|cated a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the God of armies: <HI>O our God wilt thou not judge them;</HI> wilt thou not give &s;ucce&s;s to our arms? Wilt thou not defeat them, and puni&s;h them for their iniquitous and ungene|rous attempts to deprive us of our lives and pro|perty.</P>
<P>As our ca&s;e, at the pre&s;ent time, is in a con&s;i|derable degree analogous to his, I &s;hall apply the words of the text to our&s;elves, and take occa&s;ions from them to &s;hew,</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="014474_0009_0F92B2FE13F99620">
I. That this our land is God's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which He has given us to inherit.</P>
<P>II. That no other man, or body of men, have a right to this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or any part of it, unle&s;s we &s;ee cau&s;e to give it to him, or them, for &s;ome good or valuable con&s;ideration; and therefore,</P>
<P>III. Great-Britain in &s;ending an army to turn us out of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, merely becau&s;e we will not re&s;ign up our&s;elves and property, to be di&s;po|&s;ed of at her will and di&s;cretion, is unju&s;t and bar|barous; and therefore,</P>
<P>IV. As this army is come again&s;t us, and as we cannot tru&s;t in an arm of fle&s;h or upon our coun|&s;els alone, we ought to have our eyes upon God, for him to e&s;pou&s;e our cau&s;e, and put an end to the quarrel.&mdash;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, I am to &s;hew that this our land is God's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which he has given us to inherit.</P>
<P>In province this, I mu&s;t fir&s;t give you a &s;hort hi&s;tory of the way and manner in which we be|came &s;eized of God's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which is &s;aid to be given to us.&mdash;Tho&s;e advent'rous worthies, our forefathers, the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this country, were eye witne&s;&s;es of the infringements that were made upon the civil and religious rights and immunities of their brethren the people of England, during the unpringely admini&s;tration of James, and the tyrannic reign of Charles the fir&s;t; which la&s;t, it is not impo&s;&s;ible might be an hone&s;t man, but cer|tainly was a mo&s;t mi&s;guided and impolitic king.</P>
<P>They (our ance&s;tors) &s;aw the &s;eeds of civil war were &s;prouting, which were likely to produce a dire harve&s;t of guns, bayonets, &s;words and &s;pears: and &s;o, rather than be employ'd in &s;hedding and
<PB N="13" REF="014474_0010_0F92B2FEF0754218">
trampling in their brethren's gore, they cho&s;e to for&s;ake their native &s;hores, the land of their fore|father's &s;epulchres, to procure a peaceful &s;eat in &s;ome foreign region, where they &s;hould not hear the voice of the oppre&s;&s;or&mdash;where they might be free from the &s;hackles, forged by popi&s;h prie&s;ts for their bodies and con&s;ciences too!&mdash;where they might, without mole&s;tation, wor&s;hip the God of their fathers in &s;pirit and in truth.</P>
<P>They embarked&mdash;tru&s;ting in Jehovah, com|mitted them&s;elves to the mercile&s;s inclemency of the Atlantic&mdash;the everla&s;ting God was their re|fuge&mdash;they di&s;embarked and for the fir&s;t, &s;et their feet upon this we&s;tern main.&mdash;The rocks and rough &s;hore were their bed&mdash;the hideous fore&s;ts and canopy of Heaven their covering&mdash;their gra<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">s, wild bears and wolves, and other bea&s;ts of prey, with that tawny race, who&s;e tender mercies are cruelty.</P>
<P>That part of the&s;e lands by them fir&s;t &s;ettled, they purcha&s;ed by fair bargain of the natives.</P>
<P>The re&s;t was obtained by conque&s;t, in a war entered into by them for their own ju&s;t defence&mdash;and they defended their acqui&s;itions by them&s;elves alone for a long time with inconcei|vable expence of blood and trea&s;ure! So that if purcha&s;e and conque&s;t give any people a right to any land, territories or hereditaments what&s;oever, then we have an exclu&s;ive right to this land, and all the profits of it.&mdash;</P>
<P>It is God's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as being a part of his crea|tion, the whole world is his, and the fulne&s;s; con|&s;equently he had an indefea&s;ible title to America.&mdash;It is his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for that his churches are here
<PB N="14" REF="014474_0011_0F92B2FFA1520B68">
erected, and his wor&s;hip is not carried on in greater purity and beauty, in any other part of the world.&mdash;</P>
<P>Here the doctrines of the chri&s;tian faith are known and under&s;tood in their greate&s;t purity&mdash;here are the tabernacles of God&mdash;his &s;anctuaries where he delights to dwell, and where he com|mands the ble&s;&s;ing, even life for evermore&mdash;This, I think, makes our land God's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by way of eminence.&mdash;</P>
<P>And it appears that he gave it to us to inherit, in that Americans from our ance&s;tors downward, 'till very lately, have had the peculiar &s;miles of Heaven. Where?&mdash;in what country, was it ever known that a people aro&s;e from paucity to popu|lou&s;ne&s;s &s;o fa&s;t? When in any other part of the world, did three millions of people exi&s;t in one col|lective body, in a country di&s;covered for them but little more than a century and an half?</P>
<P>This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes!&mdash;</P>
<P>And mo&s;t of us (if not all) have had the&s;e lands confirmed to us by charters, which have had the &s;anction of <HI>royal faith!</HI> Not that I &s;uppo&s;e that the royal grantors had any legal right to grant the&s;e lands, for they were not &s;eized of them, and con&s;equently had no property in them&mdash;for tho' we &s;hould admit (as we may with &s;afe|ty) that the di&s;covery of an uninhabited country, may give the di&s;coverers a right to &s;uch lands, yet this rule could not operate in this ca&s;e, becau&s;e this country was actually inhabited by the aboriginal Indians, of whom our forefathers purcha&s;ed.&mdash;</P>
<P>So that, as I conceive of it, the operation of the charters, relative to this country, was not a grant
<PB N="15" REF="014474_0012_0F92B3038425B0F8">
of the&s;e lands to tho&s;e who before had no right to them; but was only a royal promi&s;e and a&s;&s;u|rance, that we &s;hould occupy and enjoy, and not be di&s;turbed in the enjoyment of all tho&s;e lands, tenements, and hereditaments, of which the Eng|li&s;h &s;ettlers of America, before the date of &s;aid charters, were &s;eized and in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The purcha&s;ing of the&s;e lands of the Indians, the pre|tended royal grant notwith&s;tanding, is <HI>prima facie</HI> evidence, that the nominal grantees were under a full conviction that the &s;aid grant conveyed a title, in foro juris Naturalis, invalid&mdash;that it was but a meer Fictio juris, the &s;hadow, without the &s;ub&s;tance.</NOTE> And as the&s;e lands are thus clearly ours, I am naturally led to &s;ay accordingly&mdash;that no other man, or body of men, have a right to this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or any part of it, unle&s;s we &s;ee cau&s;e to give it to him or them, for &s;ome good or valuable con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>This is a doctrine, which has been &s;o often a&s;|&s;erted, and proved over and over again, and is &s;o well under&s;tood by people in general, that it &s;eems almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t upon it&mdash;But to &s;tir up your minds by way of remembrance, I will now &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome of the arguments which &s;upport the a&s;&s;ertion.&mdash;What any man acquires by his own labour and toil, he had an exclu&s;ive right to. To whatever is <HI>given</HI> to a man he has the &s;ame right&mdash;Whatever a man obtains by legal purcha&s;e, no man has a right to take from him.&mdash;The&s;e are the principal ways in which men acquire property,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The &s;y&s;tematical law, writers, mention other ways of acquiring property, &s;uch as, Occupancy, De&s;cent &amp;c. but as they are comprehended in tho&s;e I have men|tioned, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to give them a di&s;tinct con|&s;ideration.</NOTE>&mdash;
<PB N="16" REF="014474_0013_0F92B305AC0EFDE0">
Now as the natural rights of mankind are immu|tably the &s;ame, and as one man has naturally no pre-eminence above another, hence it undeniably follows (and it re&s;pects communities and their com|ponent parts as well as individuals) that no rea&s;on can be given why one man &s;hould take away, have and enjoy that which is another's, without his con|&s;ent.&mdash;The word <HI>property</HI> &s;ignifies that e&s;tate of &s;ub&s;tance which a man has and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, exclu&s;ive of the right and power of all the world be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Now, unle&s;s a man can di&s;po&s;e of what he has, as he plea&s;es, and keep it as long as he plea&s;es, he cannot be &s;aid to have any property at all.</P>
<P>This does not extend &s;o far, as to put a man at liberty to withold the payment of his ju&s;t debts, or his proportional part of the nece&s;&s;ary charges of good and whole&s;ome government.</P>
<P>For when a man contracts a debt, he is &s;uppo|&s;ed in the judgment of the law, and of rea&s;on, at that time to promi&s;e to pay that debt. By this pro|mi&s;e, the property in that matter, or &s;ub&s;tance which is to pay the &s;ame debt (whether money or any thing el&s;e)pa&s;&s;es <HI>out</HI> of the <HI>promi&s;&s;or,</HI> into the <HI>pro|mi&s;&s;ee,</HI> or him to whom the promi&s;e is made.&mdash;So in regard to paying the charges of civil govern|ment; every man in the community is &s;uppo&s;ed either explicitly or implicitly, to con&s;ent and en|gage to be a member of that community; unle&s;s he expre&s;sly declares the contrary; and in this ca&s;e, he is <HI>out lowed,</HI> and has no title or claim to any protection or &s;upport.</P>
<P>When men thus enter into &s;ociety they are &s;up|po&s;ed to con&s;ent and promi&s;e, each and every one of them, that they will bear their proportional part
<PB N="17" REF="014474_0014_0F92B3072E978938">
of the charges re&s;ulting from the &s;upport of good regulation and government.</P>
<P>And this is but the rea&s;onable and legal con|&s;truction of every man's conduct, who enters into &s;ociety. So that, even in the ca&s;es of debt, and the charges of government, the con&s;ent of every man is had, previous to the di&s;po&s;al of his property.</P>
<P>Here I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that the members of the community, in a free &s;tate, are to be con&s;ulted, and are to determine from time to time, the <HI>quan|tity</HI> of their property, which is to go to the &s;upport of civil government, and to defray other contin|gent charges. And in ca&s;e any &s;ociety, or (rather) community; neglect thus to do, their government falls to the ground, and they of cour&s;e revert to the &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>But let us &s;uppo&s;e ju&s;t for the pre&s;ent, that there are a clan of di&s;tingui&s;hed, high-privileged mortals in the world, perhaps in Great-Britain, who have a legal right to levy taxes, and di&s;po&s;e of the pro|perty of their fellow-mortals at their own plea&s;ure and di&s;cretion!&mdash;Let us &s;ee where it will carry us.</P>
<P>If they have a right in this way to take &s;ix pence, by the &s;ame rule they may take a &s;hilling. And when their pur&s;es, after a frolick, are grown a little lank, and their inclination prompts them, they may take a pound&mdash;and &s;o on, till they have got the whole. Whence it follows, that there are &s;ome of our fellow-mortals, who, however hone&s;t and well de&s;erving they may be, and let them la|bor ever &s;o hard, and procure ever &s;o much gain, yet LEGALLY they have no property at all. This doctrine of the di&s;po&s;al of property, without the con&s;ent of the proprietor, is &s;o ridiculous and
<PB N="18" REF="014474_0015_0F92B307EDBC7348">
ab&s;urd, that it &s;eems to me it is not irrational to &s;uppo&s;e that it had its origination in Bedlam, or&mdash;a wor&s;e place!</P>
<P>I will conclude this head with producing only one authority from a writer who under&s;tood the nature of civil government, as well (at lea&s;t) as any writer, ancient or modern&mdash;the famous ALGER|NON SYDNEY&mdash;Says he, "NO MAN CAN GIVE THAT WHICH IS ANOTHER's." Which leads me to the con&s;ideration of the third thing a&s;&s;erted, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>

<PB N="31" REF="014474_0028_0F92B319E3CDE4C0">
&mdash;And what is now our duty? Mu&s;t we now &s;it &s;till and maintain peace with the butchers of our friends? Shall we maintain it "at the ex|pence of property, liberty and life, and all that dear"? God forbid! If ever there was a call in providence to take the &s;word, there now is&mdash;Therefore <HI>to arms!&mdash;to arms!</HI>&mdash;le&s;t that cur&s;e fall upon us, which fell upon the da&s;tardly inha|bitants of <HI>Meroz</HI> (Jud. 5. 23.) "Cur&s;e ye Meroz, &s;aid the angel of the Lord; cur&s;e ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof: becau&s;e they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord again&s;t the mighty."</P>
<P>We tru&s;t that all, who&s;e circum&s;tances will ad|mit of it, will go&mdash;that none &s;uch will refu&s;e to inli&s;t in defence of his country. When God, in his providence, calls to take the &s;word; if any refu&s;e to obey, Heaven's dread artillery is levelled again&s;t him, as you may &s;ee, Jer. 48. 10. CURSED BE HE THAT KEEPETH BACK HIS SWORD FROM BLOOD; cur&s;ed is that &s;neaking coward who neglects the &s;inking &s;tate when called to its defence&mdash;O then, flee this dire cur&s;e&mdash;let Ame|rica's valorous &s;ons put on the harne&s;s, nor take it off till peace &s;hall be to I&s;rael.</P>
<P>When they have engaged by enli&s;tment, let them act with fidelity, nor e'er de&s;ert or leave the ground, till the campaign is ended, till fair, tho' bani&s;hed PEACE is full re&s;tor'd to MASSACHU|SETTS-BAY, and the whole we&s;tern world.&mdash;If any do de&s;ert, the thunder bolt divine is direc|ted to their hearts, in the prophet Jeremiah, <HI>Cur&s;ed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully"</HI></P>
<P>He that by enli&s;tment plights his faith, then leaves the ground a coward, merits this dire cur&s;e.
<PB N="32" REF="014474_0029_0F92B31A9627AD38">
&mdash;But there is another &s;ort of coward, who (to u&s;e the words of a late rou&s;ing preacher) are &s;ly hypo|critical cowards, who undertake the work of the Lord, that is, take up arms; but they do it deceit|fully&mdash;they do not faithfully u&s;e their arms for the purpo&s;es for which they were taken&mdash;they com|mence &s;oldiers, not that they may &s;erve their coun|try, and do their duty to God&mdash;but that they may live in ea&s;e, idlene&s;s and plea&s;ure, and enrich them|&s;elves at the public expence.&mdash;Cur&s;ed be he that doth the work of the lord deceitfully, and &s;erves him&s;elf under pretence of &s;erving his country.&mdash;Thus he.&mdash;</P>
<P>Let none merit this flagitious character&mdash;but let them act their parts with fidelity, that &s;o, at la&s;t, they may receive the rewards of good&amp;faithful &s;er|vants&mdash;that they may be found &s;uch good &s;oldiers in the temporal militia, as that, at la&s;t, they may be rai&s;ed to, and mingled with the CHURCH TRI|UMPHANT in heaven.&mdash;</P>
<P>To conclude&mdash;Let us all realize, that we are candidates for eternity&mdash;"We mu&s;t &s;ave our &s;ouls, as well as our country." We have no might again&s;t the great company of principalities and powers of darkne&s;s, which are come again&s;t our &s;ouls to de&s;troy them with an everla&s;ting de&s;truc|tion.&mdash;O our God, wilt thou not judge and prevent <HI>them</HI>&mdash;the&s;e are more terrible than all the troops of Britain, France. or Spain, with guns and &s;words, and all the dreadful artillery of death.&mdash;May we now put on the whole armour of God, and quit our&s;elves like men and be &s;trong, and having done all, make a vigorous &s;tand&mdash;May we all enli&s;t in this &s;piritual welfare,&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="014474_0030_0F92B31B4FDC7878">
May we now commence eternal ho&s;tilities with SIN, and be enabled by our God to carry on a &s;ucce&s;sful war again&s;t it, may be we fight the good fight of faith and overcome all our &s;piritual ene|mies, the world, the fle&s;h and the devil thro' him that loved us&mdash;that &s;o fighting as good &s;oldiers of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, we may be thought worthy to enter into the kingdom of the prince of peace: Even into that kingdom which cannot be &s;haken; where are no wars, nor rumours of wars, but an everla&s;ting re&s;t for the people of God.</P>
